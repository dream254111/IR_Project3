Victoria of Sir T L Mitchell,i303892, 228  APPENDIX XVExtracts from the Journal of an explori71g Expedition into Central Australia to determine the Colease of the River Barcoo or the Victoricz of Sir T L Mitchell By the late Mr E B KENNEDYX of the SurveyorGenerals Department Sydney Communicated by the Rev W B CLAREE MA To the Secretary of the Woyal Geographical Society S IR LIEUTCOL SIR T L M1TCHELL SurveyorGeneral of New South Vales having returned fFom his expedition into tropical Australia in search of an overland route to the Gulf of Carpentaria without having ascertained the final course of the River Barcoo or Victoria whence the expedition returned that officer proposed to the Colonial governrnent that a irther exploration should take place by a party under the command of Mr Kennedy and instructions were accordingly directed to that gentleman to pursue the route pointed out by the SurveyorGeneral 1hose instructions are printed in the Journal of Sir T L Mitchells Expedition into Tropical Australia pp 406411 pub lished in 1848 and the reader is referred to those instructions and to the following jourrlal for proof of the accuracy with which Mr Rennedy obeyetl them Mr Kennedy having been selected in the early part of 1848 to explore the York Penillsula found the interval between that period and his return from the Victoria too much occupied to allow him to edit his journal At his own request therefore and at thc suggestion of Captain Owen Stanley R N with the concurrence of the Colonial Secretary and Mr Kennedys personai friends I undertook the duty of comiling a narrative of the expedition The melancholy termination of the late expedition to the York Peninsula in the massacre of the gallant leader and the deaths by sickness ot all his fol lowers but three the circumstances of which have been detailed by one of the survivors Mr W Carron has illduced me to change my original plan and in the anxious desire to do honour to the memory of a brave kind and intelli gent friend whose calamity has excited the most painful interest in the com munity I have thought it better to make as little alteration as possible in the narrative drawn up lly himself day by day than to condense the statement from his journals I think this will furnish the best testimony to his zeal and devotiorl to the service and exhlbit better than any comments his sagacity skill patience and integrity qualifications which are essential to successful travel together with that general amiableness of disposition and that sense of moral and religious obligation svhich were conspicuous in his conduct According to the oral testimony of his companions he had in an eminent degree many of those attributes of character and much of that intelligence svhich would have eventually7 had it not pleased Providence to close his career raised him to eminence in the annals of geographical research To the credit which he gained by his first explorations must now be added the interest attached to his memory by the unfortunate termination of his career and if he did not achieve any brilliant exploits in the field he has the merit of having offered his life as a sacrifice to the cause of gcographical scicnce and the advancement of Australia  rfX t 14At OO   BtigM 17t    4  E i pa j81S 0  X  24  12 13 14 N l vP ff20 t   5R 5f  z X A   RS X d Opem Forest  r

  IagS 18b2 lTryecGlition ildto Cerltral Australi 229 The apparellt defect in this Journal as regards that important question the level of the Desert was the result of an accident Sil T L Mitchell furnished Mr Kennedy with the use of the excellent syphon barometer which he had employed in his omn expedition to the Vic toria but vn the 24th of March 1847 eleven days only after the party left Sydrley on suspending the instrument to a tree for the purpose of takin the elevation of a spot on the N of the Haukesbury River which that day had been crossed the branch gave way and the barometer was laroken and on returning to Sydrwey no otXler instrument wasfound availa7lefor the journey It is to be regretted that we have therefore no accurate data for calculatillg the depression of the Australian continent along the course of the Victoria and the state of ttle Desert as detailed by Kennedy and Sturt renders it im robable that such intormation can now be easily obtained It cannot but be desirable that the ingenuity of men of science should be directed to supplying some means more portable and Jess fragile than those upon mhich so large an amount of calculated altitudes now depends Dl Leichbardts extraordinarv journey to Port Essington would have been infinltely more useful had he possessed the means of levelling on his route He felt this so much that on his subsequent attempt to cross the continent and on setting out on his present journey he lett his barometer in my charge and took vsith him a boilingwater apparattls which I lent him but which owing to the saline condition oi the uraters in the interior would probably give hiln inaccurate results Having myself used estensively various barometers of the Aneroid con struction in taking elevations in Australia I wish here to point out that if a proper correction could be devised for the eSects of temperature and the instrument could be made equally portable as now uith sufficient expansion of the interior vacuumbox to allow of measurements up to 6000 or 7000 feet and the addition of a vernier to enable accurate divisions of the inch into thousandths to be read oR the Aneroid Barozneter would be aIl invaluable assistance to surveyors in general and to explorers in particular Some remarkable coincidences between altitudes ascertained by levelling and by the Aneroid prove to me that in certain conditions ot the atmosphere this instrument even now used carefully is perfect But for an extensive Journey over broken ground in this variable climate it is not aluays to be relied on I consider myself justified in calling the attention of the Royal Geographical Society to this instrument after having tested it in about a thou sanl sets of observations at all elevations up to 2000 feet The following Journal throws much fresh light upon the course of the Louter Barcoo and the desert between the Warrego and the Culgoa and com pletes the historv of all the expeditions up to the present date excepting only that ot the long expected Leichhardt It comulences after the arrival of the expedition at the Wollombi the party having left Sydney on the 13th of March BT B C April 1st Proceeded on our journey crossed the creek at about a mile and a half from our camp of the previous night and aftel travelling a distance of 17 miles encamped by the side of Mr Blaands fence at Fordwich native name Kinnelan 2nd Continued our journey towards Musuell Brook at a distance of 6 miles crossed the Jerry Plains road near the Cock Inn and proceeded along the new line of road  forded the Hunter at Mr Smiths farm and encamped about 5 miles from the river after a journey ot 16 miles 3rd At an early hour our party were in rnotion and at 2 PM encamped at Muswell Brook after travelling a distaluce of l4 miles Wrote to Captain King respecting a barometer and purchased some meat for the party230 Extracts from the Journal of an ewploring 4th This being Sunday we remained encamped at Muswell Brook the thernxometer Fahrenheit stood in the tent at 102 being 58 higher than on the previous Wednesday 5th Proceeded from Muswell Brook to Scone a distance of 16 miles where we arrived at 2 PM and where by the payment of a trifling gratllity we were allowed to turn our horses into a paddock belonging to a person of the name of Glanfield 6th Travelled a distance of 16 rniles and encamped at Jack Sheas Water hole or lagoonS about a mile beyond the  Shetland House  Inn the weather mild and pleasant 7th Continued our journey across the range and through the valley of the Paye in which is situated the Township of Murrurulldi At the distance of a mile and a half from the Toz nship we crossed the steepest part of the Liverpool Range which forms the bourldary of the colony and encamped in Doughboy Hollow I vvas forcibly reminded today of the character of the country through which we were travelling by being told by one of our bullock drivers that uZe should find water in the Round Waterhole a few miles farther on and that there would be plenty for 2 or 3 days to come That scanty supply is all the water on the road for a distance of upwards of 20 miles aIld on such surface water we must continually depend often running the risk of finding it dry upon our return 8th Our horses having had a fatiguing days work crossing the Liverpool Range yesterday I thowlght it prudent to encamp at the Round Waterilole 7 miles from Doughboy EIollow 9th Proceeded on otlr journey at an early hollr and at a distance of 9 miles passed the junction of the Mokai and Peel roads Encamped at Loders station on the Liverpool Plains after a journey of 12 miles Thunderstorms were playing about us during the afternoon and at 8 PM a very heavy olle passed over the camp 10th Travelled as far as Curribubula where there is an inn kept by a person of the name of Davis the distance bom Loders to Curribubula is estimated at 25 miles but I should consider it nearer 20 Heavy thunderclouds were observable all day 11th Anxious to reach Pringles station on the Peel where I was to pro cure a ton of flour I travelled contrary to custom on this day Sunday in order to escape the rain which appeared to be setting ill On arriving at the turn of to Pringles two bullock drivers persuaded me that the road I was about to take was the wrong one and I did not discover thls error till we had gone about 5 miles out of our way Encamped at the CIay Waterholes 10 miles from Tamworth I inquired of a carrier I met here wllat he uould charge for conveying flour 200 or 300 miles on my journey to which he replied ll a hundred 12th I instructed Mr Turner to conduct the party to Pringles by the road we had misscal while I proceeded to Tamworth to inquire for letters and to procure a native to accompany the expedition Found a letter from CaptaiIl King kindly offering me the loan of a barorneter if I could ride over to his place for it a distance of upwards of 150 miles Having comrleted my busi ness at amworth and received the promise of a horse from Mr Commissioner Bligh I rode to Mr Pringles 17 miles to meet my party and to endeavour to make such arrangements as would admit of their continuing their journey while I was absent at Port Stephens On my arrival I found Mr Pringle away from home but wrote a note to him expressing my wish to purchase of him a cart horse harness c and saying that as I was ansious the party should proceed with as little delay as possible I would give him his own price for them 13thi Started for lahlee the residealce of Captain King taking with me aEvedition into Central Sustralia 231 man in the hope of purchasing the cart c I required within the first 15 or 20 miles On arriving at the Commissioners Mr Bligh I learned to my great disappointment that the horse he had promised to lend me could carry me only 30 miles a day whereas I required him to perbrm a distance of upwards of 160 miles before the 16th Seeing that my only chance of reaching Tahlee in time was by riding my own horse and that in doing so I should be absent from my party a longer period than I considered justifiable I was com pelled with much reluctance to abandon the attempt I accordingly returned to Mr Pringles where I arrived at 7 PM having been caught in a heavy thunder shower The flour according to my directions had been packed in 50 lb bags and a canister of powder was placed in the centre of each 14th Continued heavy rain throughout the day which would have pre vented our travelling had we been prepared to do so  Sth The rain of yesterday and last night rendered the ground impassable for drays Mr Pringle returned home at noon and I purchased from him a cart horse shaft and leading harness with canvas for a cover The cart requiring some repairs our blacksmith was employed during the afternoon in mending it Mr Turner took an inventory of our eqtlipment and we had the horses all branded t on the near shoulder 16th The blacksmith finished the repair3 to the cart and shod the horse The drays were carefully loaded and preparations made for an early start in the evening Paid Mr Prillgle for the purchases I had made of him by cheques on the bank of Australasia 17th Travelled l8 miles to Mr Stows station at Carrol crossed the Namoi river and encamped on the N side of it Mr Turner remained at Mr Pringles to bring on any letters that might arrive by the post 18th This being Sunday we remained encampec3 on the Namoi l9th Proceeded on our journey down the N bank of the Namoi and after travelling a distance of 16 miles encamped on the river weather showery throughout the day 20th We continued our journey down the N side of the river till we reached Mr Bentworths head station when we crossed it or rather ils channel and thus proceeded to a lagoon 7 miles distant where we erlcamped 21st Started at an early hour and after travelling 6 miles arrised at Mr Towns Station mrhere we remained for a short time and then proceeded on to Dr Adams station where we eneamped after a journey ot 16 miles The grass having been abundant at our two last camps we directly hobbled our horses but did not tether them The weather showery 22nd Resumed our journey and at a distance of about 8 miles passed Lady Jamisons station where I procured from the overseer an aboriginal youth named IIarry to accompany the expedition encamped about 15 miles fron Dr Adams station 23rd It rained heavily last night and this morning but anxious to cross the Namoi while fordable we continued our journey and at a distance of about 5 miles passed over to the right bank of the river Passed one of Mr Went worths stations in the course of the day and encamped in the neighbourhood of Mr Doyles station after a journey of 15 miles Showers at intervals throughout the day 24th The ground was in such a state this morning from the effects of the rain which had continued almost without intermissioll during the night that I deemed it advisable to halt for the day although I did so with much regret being anxious to proceed with as little delay as possible 25tAz This being Sunday we remained in camp according to custom 26th At an eary hour this morning we resurned our journey trarersing the Galathera Plains and after travelling 16 miles encarxoped on a creek called Galathera I had the satisfactioll of finding that me had gained rather than232 Extracts from the Journal of an ezp70ring lost by our halt of the two previous days for the plains uere in such a state that notwithstanding the heat of yesterday coupled with a frosty night it was ith considelable difficulty that we uere able to cross a portion of them 27th At starting this nlorning one of the leading horses broke a hame which being repaced by a wooden one we resumed our journey after about an hours delay Encamped at the Tenmile Creek 289 The thermometer Fahrenheit stood this morning at 34 in the tent ontinued our journey and crossing a boggy creek encamped after travelling a distanee of 122 miles near Blown s station at Milli At 3 PM the ther mometer stood at 70 in the tent 29th Struck the tents and quitting the Settlerss road folloued Sir T Mitchellfs track to Camp 89 on the Moomins where we found much less Bater than when ue left it in December The track of Sir lhonlass dras was scarcely discernible across Browns run 30tA2 Continued our journey over a very heavy country subject to inunda tion and through a flooded boxforest The water seen in the marsh on our previous journey bad disappeared and on arriving at Sir T Mitchells camp on the 12th and 13th of Decembert we found the ehannel of that creek dry and were therefore compelled to yroceed by a forced march to the Gwydir which we only reached at sunset Owing to the heavy nature of the ground over which we had travelled ollr draught horses were completely knocked up May 1st EIaving had a long days journcy yesterday and knowing that mre should have a distance of 27 or 28 miles to travel7 after leaving this without water we halted today to refresh our horses Mr T Brown who has a statlon between 2 and 3 miles to the eastFard ot Sir T Mitchells traek called at the camp this atternoon and kindly supplied the party with beef and nlilk 2nd As we had encamped upon the river about a mile E of Sir T Mitchells track owing to our having lost it on the plains we dropped down to it this afternoon and made preparations for our long journey without water by distributing our baggage among the horses SQ as to lighten the carts as much as possible Abotlt noon today it blew a hot wind from the westward whih appeared to be the forerunner of a thunderstorm btlt it cleared in the evening 3rd At an early hour this morning me commenced our long dry ularch the lnen walking and leading their horses which mere laden with a portion of the contents ot the carts Fortunatelv the day was cool but the ground over which we travelled was heavy At 3h 30m rM we encamped at Sir T Mitchells old camping ground 4th Proceeded on our journey in light marching order but in consequence of our carthorses gibbing a good deal our progress was slow At a distance of 10 miles we reached the Gil il bllt found barely sufficient water in it to refresh our horses so after an hours rest we continued our journey and exlcamped at 5h 30m PM at a lagoon 1 mile distant from Camp 88 5th Having accomplished last evening a distance of 33 miles without water I allowed the horses to feed llntil the afternoon and rode down to Mr Bucknells station about the fords on the Barwan and iBoomi but did not find any one at home to give me the necessary information I took 2 natives whom I bund at the station back with me however7 in the hope of being able to obtain from them the desired intelligence through my interpreter Harry and on arriving at the camp was told that Mr Bucknells stockman had been there and sail se Inust cross the Boomi at their station 3 miles doun and then proceed to Long Davids 1o miles further out of ourway I there fore preferred trusting to my guides7 and we accordingly continued our journey along 03ir T Mitchells track to the Boomi and had travelled about a mile up the r ivel  when the younger native shosted us a part of the channellZxpedition into Central Australia 233 nearly dry here we crossed by means of a few logs which we laid dowrl and tracing the river back encamped on Sir Thomass track on the N side of it In the eveninffl 3 natives arrived at the camp from Mr Bucknels station a distance of 5 or 6 miles bringing a note and 40 or 50 lbs of beef for the use of the party 6th Having dispatched the natives back again with a note of thanks we proceeded with our guides along the track to the Barwan on reaching M hich we were engaged for some time in searching for a practicable ford and at length discovexed a very good one about a mile above the place where Sir T Mitchell crossed Encamped at 3 PM on the N bank of the river 7th ur guides conducted us through the intricacies of the lagoons to Sir lthomass track from the Moonii distant from our camp about a mile there we parted with our guides whom I rewarded for their good condllet by making cach of them a present ot a fig of tobacco at which they appeared much pleased and seemed sorry to leave us VVe continued our journey along the track through a rosewood scrub and encamped on a plain 13 miles from the Barwan without water 8th Travelled a distance of 11 miles to Johnstons station on the Mooni where we encamped the aspect of the weather made me kar that the rainy season Bas setting in for all day long cloud after cloud continued to drive from the SW 9th This being Sunday we halted according to custom lOth Proceeded 8 miles up the river and encamped 11th ontinued our journey and atter trarelling 14 rxjiles reached Roachs the outside station of the settlers In the evening wrote to Captain Perry 12th Having left my letter at Roachs to be forwarded and procured a tzelvemonths suppy of arease for our cart wheels we took our departure from the last station and proceeded along Sir T Mitchells track for a distance of 8 miles where we encamped early in the afternoon 13th Continued our journey towards the Balonne and after travelling 10 miles encamped in an open pine forest Sent the horses to water at a swamp about a quarter of a nsile distant bearing ENE 14th rhe horses having been on the tether all night were taken to water at daylight this morning and at 8h 30m AM our partv were again in motion After proceeding about 9 miles Boser one of our shaft horses was knocked up and we were obliged to change him at a distance of 9 miles we were com pelled to make the circuit of a swamp through which Sir Thomass road had passed on the previous journeyX it being then dry lfrom this to within 4 miles of Calllp 8 the track is only discerrsible to a natives eye but with Harrys assistance we uere enabled to keep it and about 5 PM arrived at St Georges Piridge we found a rapid current in the river but encamped in safety on our old ground at 5h 30m PM 15th Two of our carthorses being knocked up yesterday I deemed it necessary to give thetn two days rest before proceeding to the 2nd Depot issued 5 rounds of ammunition to every man in the party and the regulations I had drawn up at starting Commenced our night watch this evening 16th Three natives were seen by VVall this morning At 11 AM divine service was performed 17th Proceeded on our journey and encamped at Camp 9 of Sir T Mitchell In the afternoon Wall encountered two natives at a short distance from the camp one of them spoke tuo or three words of English and both apeared desirous of coming llp to the tents but that I could not allowj and on my dispatching tsvo men with fire arms for the purpose of driving theIn away they took to their heels 18tAz Continued our journey and at a distance of 2 miles were obliged to leave Sir Thomass track mhich ran along the bed of the river In consc234 Etracts from tAte Journal of an explori7lg quence of the late floods having rendered the ground irnpassable we therefore proceeded through the forest ground and came upon the river again about 2 miles from Camp 10 Followed the track along its bed for a short distance but were soon obliged to regain the forest ground and at length encampei between Camps 10 and 83 Passed two parties of natives fishing but did not speak to them Just as we were passing the second party onc of our carts upset and the men svere engaged 20 mlnutes in settinz all to rights again but the accident had only the effect of withdrawing them 20 or 30 yards 19th At an early hour we were on the move and afteI travelling about a mile and a half arrived at Camp 83 and turned into the track that led to the Maranoa I was exceedingly anxious to see the bed of that river as I con sidered it might be taken as a fair indication of the fortune eitller good or bad that awaited us on our journey On reaching its bank where we en camped I found to my great satisiction that a flood had wasLed its channel siIlce we last crossed it and that there was an abundant supplv of water Examined the arms and ammunition Natives were seen by tall about a mile from the camp 2Ch Several natives were seen this morning by the men who brought up the horses Crossed the river or nlore properly speaking a dry channel and after a Journey of 14 miles encamped on the Maranoa Found water in small holes on the surEace but abundance maa be obtained anywhere by digw ging in the sand 21st Proceeded as far as Camp 82 a distance of only 9 miles but owing to the soft and yielding nature of the gl ound over which we travelled it proved a fatiguing days journey7 especialy to our carthorses which suffiered much in spite of our eSors to relieve them by constant changes Water was more abundant here than on our former visit At about 8 eX rain commenced accompanied with thunder and lightning 22nd Anxious to lose as little time as possible we proceeded on our journey andy after accomplishing a distance of 11 miles encamped in a drizzling rain on the water marked permanent in Sir T Mitchells map Wall shot one of the porphyryheaded finches 23rd Halted this day Sunday Laid dosvn the Victoria on my general map Arrowsmiths by doing which I find that the general course of the river turns towards the NE bend of one which Fiturt left in 25 9 S ancl 138 6l E I hope that the Victoria does not like the Balonne split into minor creeks which flow towards the desert 2Ath This day having been appointed for the trial of some gibbing horses our progress was but slow and it was only by taking some of the flour ofF the dravs and distributing it among such of the packhorses as could carry it that we coulxl get on at all Encamped at surset at Drysdale Ponds In those at svhich Sir Thomass cattle watered there was but a little mater but about a mile to the westward the men found a large and apparently deep lagoon a continuation I imagine of the same ponds 2Sth Continued our journey along the track and after travelling 9 miles encamped without mater The bed of the river appearing moist we commenced digging a well but at a depth of 6 geet were stopped by a stiff dry clay Consinced from the numler of birds about us that there must be water in the neighbourhood I dispatched Douglas and Harry in search of some The former returned unsuccessful7 but was closely followed by Harry who had crossed our channel and found some in a larger branch of the river about a mile off running in a parallel direction There vas xlO water on the surface but by digging with his hand he obtained some Two men with kegs were accordingly dispatched with which they returned soon after dusk 26th Continued our journey and at a distance of 12 miles found water in a flat by the roadside at which we cncamIedExIvedition into Ceratral JustraZia 235 27th It commenced raining about 4 AM and continued without intermission throughout the day We accordingly remained where we were and as there was plenty of grass for the horses and it would be necessary at all events to give them a couple of days rest before leaving the Maranoa I did not regret the delay 28th Rain al day vvith heavy squalls from the NE and every appear ance of itS COntlilUing 29th It rained heavily throughout the night but cleared up towards morn ing rrhe ground however being too saturated to admit of our travelling we remained encamped The river is less than threequarters of a mile to the westward of the camp and there being a fine permanent sheet of water this spot would be urell situated for a station 30th Sunday remained in camp 31st At an early hour this morning we resumed our journesr and after tratelling 9 miles encamped at tlle sheet of water Camp 80 Our horses although much refreshed by their rest had nevertheless ahald days journey to draw the carts over the still saturated ground At the spot where Sir T Mitchell left the tomahawk we found an unusual number of native camps their proprietors no doubt having been attracted to the spot in the hope of a similar piece of good fortune June 1st Continued our joutney but from the heavy rain which appeared to have fallen in this direction the ground was almost impassable The whole country travelled over today was completely saturated besides being naturally a heavy loose soil Encamped at a fine sheet of water 4 miles below Camp 79 21zd Arrived at Camp 79 but from the effects of the flood which appeared to have lately taken lace in the river the ascent of the west bank was so steep that we were obliged to encamp and employ the men in cutting a road for the carts The promising appearance of a creek which joins the river here from the westward induced me to ride u it for 4 or 5 miles at which distance it still contained water Its junction with the Maranoa is more imposing than the junction of that river with the Balonne and I am inclined to think it comes from a distance and may be a river of some importance higher up 3rd Crossed the river and proceeded as far as Camp 78 found the grass on fire in two or three places 4th Proceeded along the track to vfithin a mile of Camp 77 where we halted to avoid the detour made by Sir T Mitchell for want of water All the creeks having their sources in Mount Colby ridge now contain water 5th Continued our journey along the track at a quicker pace than usual until we arrived within 2 miles of Camp 76 Here the plains became so soft and swampy from the late rains that each cart had to be drawn by four horses instead of two and from the delay thus occasioned we had to grope our way through a scrub in the dark and did not arrive at Camp 76 at the junction of the deep creek with the Maranoa until 7 PM all our draught horses suffiered much from the latter part of this davs journey 6th Halted as usual on this day Sunday and much need our horses had of rest 7th Started this morning with a hope that we might reach Camp 29 the Depot but finding at 33 PM that we were 5 nsiles distant from it in a direct line and that in order to reach it we should have to cross the Maranoa twice I deemed it advisable to encamp and set the men to cut away the river bank for the greater facility of crossing in the morning Up to this time our progress has been very slow but it has been greatly impeded by the late heavy rains A considerable portion of this days journey has been over what would be in a dry season hard forest ground but which has been rendered almost impassable by the wet weather236 Eztracts from the Jourszal of cln elorizg 8tAl Proceeded on our journey and at length arrived at the Depot I shal never forget the nlingled sensations I experieneed on reaching it and seeing my tent pitched in exactly the same spot it had occupied the year before during the five months I remained in charge of the Depat I was mllch pleased at finding everything in exactly the same state as ue left them and even the Xm stoos and tables we had left behind uewe untouched The garden evidently appeared to have been unvisited except by the birds and rats that had devoured the pumpkins of which there seemed to ha7e been an abundant crop 9th Remained at the Depot Several of the horscs were shod today and the difFerent individuals of the party employed in various ways 10th Engaged in shoeing the remainder of the horses and doing other llecessary work Finding on inquiry that me had now 3025 lbs of flour on hand I this day granted to the men in consideration of the toil and fatigue they had been subjeeted to in driving and vvalking across such a heavy country as we had lately been travellilg over an addition of 15 lbs a meek till ure reach the Victoria On startil g from Sydney the men joined witls the cxpectation of riding the whole uay except when it came to their turnl to drive the carts At the Peel I found it necessary to add anotller cart to my equipment and from that place to our present camp three men have been driving and all of their own accord walking the horses having bcen con verted irlto packhorses in order to lighten the carts as much as possible by which means oul progress has been materially accelerated I therefore con sidered this boon was justly due to them more particularly as it was unsolicitel and I found fiom my stock of flour that I could very well grant it l lth Cl ossed the Maranoa and proceeded for a distance of 4 miles along Sir T Mitchells track but althouth the services of one black boy Harry and of every man of the party were put in requisition to endeavour to trace out the return route our search svas in vain and finding the track we were on 7ending to the eastward of N I quitted it and steered NNW by following which course I came upon the river rtlnning nearly E and W and encamped in lat 26 7 l3 S 12th Crossed the river and attempted to make Camp 32 by travel ling NNMr  but at a distance of 6 miles we were met by a pine and brigalow scrub which compelled us to change our course to Nw and WNw At 4 PM we crossed the river at the junction of a steep gully and encamped in lat 26 2t 30t S at which point the river forms a sharp bend from the east ward to S 13th Halted as usual on this day Sunday and in the aftelnoon took a walk in search of Sir T litchell s track but without success 14th With an idea that we should encounter an uly country we started this rnorning for Possession Creek and at a distance of l miles on a beating of N got into a dense brigalow scrubs through which the men had to cut a passage for the carts Being a few yards in advanee of the party I climbed to the top of the highest tree I could finds and cast my eyes around in search of an open country or at least an ordinary scrub but in vain With littJe satis faction I at length determined upon a direction by keeping uhich we got clear of the scrub in a distance of about half a mile  here we ill in with Sirtr Mitchellts track which we followed to Camp 32 vvhere we arrived only at 3 PM SO great had been our detention in making our uray through the scrub Two natives were seen today by the party weather cloudy l 5th Made another start for Camp 33 on Possession Creek By keeping a NNW course we had the good fortune to meet w ith ground as open and firm as it was the reverse yesterday the forest colsisting generally of acacia and box with about 200 or 300 yarls of a brigalow scrub At about 7 miles we came upon the river to the westward of a northerly bend ghereEzpedition into Ce7ztra1 Australia 237 Sir rhomas caught the last glimpse of it before turning westward to Possession Creek Arrived at Camp 33 at 2 PM Error of Indes found toda to be 1 45 16th Following Sir T Mithells track vse arrived at Camp 34 but found the bed of the creek dry Having in vain searfhed for water above and below the marked tree I determined on falling back to the river and there leave the party in camp while I reconnoitred the country to the westmrard in the direction of amp 34 Creeks with this view I desired the men to return along the track and rode on uith Harry in search of water expecting to find some in the river above the junctifln of the creek I took a due E course but finding after a ride nf 8 miles that I did not reach the river but was follonvin the general course of the creek and it being now near sunset I returned and found the party had just encamped at a small waterhole sufficient to supply our wants for the night Our position was about a fnile and a halt to the east ward of Camp 34 17th Vater in very small holes was found further down the creek The quantity however being sufflcient for the suply of the party seor a week I determined on making an excursion to the spot where Sir fl Mitchell marked  Smoke  in the supposed course of the Warrego The day was therefore spent irl making preparations for a weeks absence from the eamp and I instructed Mr Turner to follow Sir T Mitchells return track as far as Camp 37 and ascertain the state of that creek and whether if necessary we could obtain a suyply of water in that direction Found the variation ot the needlc to be 9 5 E and our latitude 25 49 32 S 18th Leaving some written instructions for Mr Turners guidance during my absence I started taking with me Douglas Luff and Harry on a bearing ot 305 E of N7 intending to rnake the creek whence Sir tr Mitchell turned back on the 15th June For 5 kniles we traversed an open forest consisting of pine and iron barkt uhen we were met by a dense scrub at a distance ot 8 xliles the forest became more open We crossed Sir rr Mitchells track running 35 E and came upon a creek corltaining an abundance of uater After resting our horses for an hollr we proceeded on the same bearing crossing the creek which appeared to take a northeasterly direction and penetrating through a long dense serub arrived at some fine flats and after a journey of 17 miles reached a considerable creek runlling to the NE re ceiving I imagine the uzatel frorm the flats cressed this afternoon uthere we encarnped 19th Continued our journey on the same bearing as yesterday 305 E For some miles our route lay through much the same description ot country as we had traversed on the preceding day but at a distance of 16 miles we reached the Downs of the Warrego and at 21 miles encarnped upon the creek in latitude 25 291 18t S The Warrego intersects fine open Downs alld we found urater at short distances ill small holes not to be deperlded upon in summer 20th Follovved the river half a mile down on a south courset then erossed it and ascended a range 7 miles to the uestward of the camp uhich enabled me to ascertain its position by a round of angles On taking a view to the vestward I observed smoke in a deep valley about 3 miles and apparently having a NNW direction Very extensive plains vsere observable on the horizon extellding from S to 2359 E of N Returned to the Warrego and encamped half a milc S of W of last nights bivouac 21st rhe valley observed yesterday lying in the direction in whieh I wished to travel I leemed it advisable to devote a lay to tlle exploration of it I accordingiy started this morning on a bearing ot 234 in w hich directioll there appeared to be an easy ascent to the dividing ranpe At a distance ot 7 miles we brought the ri3ge laiel elown ill lat 25 29t ill Sir 1 Mitchells chal t238 Extractsfrom the Journal of an exyloring to bear S and after having penetrated 4 or 4 miles of very dense scrub we followed an open box flat to its junction with a deep sandy channe of a river probably the Nive and recognised as such by Douglas We folloued this liver up in a NNW direction for upwards of 9 miles but did not meet with a single waterhole and at lenath encamped without water in about lat 25 20 S 22nd Continued our journey up the left bank in search of water  and at 4 miles NNE of our last nights camp we discovered a native vvell at the junc tion of a creek with the river by clearing out which Be obtained a plentiful supply of excellent watel for ourselves and horses Continued our search up the channel in a NN W direction and at a distance of 9 miles from our canlp of the previous evening encampel in lat 25 16 10 at a deep though small vvaterhole at the junction ot a creek from the northward with the river vvhich latter bore N of E Climbed a tree on the top of a ridge half a mile to the northward of our camp and took the bearing of several hills the one I con cluded to be Mount Playfair bore 327 to 330 distant about 8 miles 23rd Our camp of the 19th bearing SSE rom that of last night I returned on that course this morning keeping the river untiI I arrived at a plain whence I hoped to obtain a clear passage over the range but soon found a brigalow scrub though not so dense as usual Mre bored through it for a distance of 10 miles and crossed the VVarrego about a lnile above the camp I have traced the course of this river or rather of the plains which it irJtersects from two or three heights and find that from lat 25 to 25 29 they stretch to the eastward returning to the sanse meridian and at about 25 45 appear to tale a westerly direction 24th It commenced raining about i2 oclock last night and continued almost without intermission during the day and as on my return to the camp I had to find a passage for the carts through a long scrub I halted this day under the shelter of a piece of bark Harry shot two ducks 25th A bitterly cold morning Startecl at 8 AM and returning by our track crossel the plains in about 7 miles At a distance of 10 miles I left the return track to my right in the hote of escaping the thick pine scrub we had previously encountered and partially succeeded At 13 miles crossed our tracks on a flat just at the entrance ot another scrub which we avoided by fol lowing the flat down and at a distance ot 2 miles fell in with them again and kept them to our bivouac of the 18th where we arrived at 3h 20m PM 26th Returned to our campingground in lat 25 49 32 S near Samp 34 but ound that Mr Turner had proceeded with the party to the first water on Sir t1 Mitchells returntrack in accol dance with tny instructions to that effect in the event of the water in the creek failing them Followed their tracks and found them encamped in lat 25 441 50 S 27th Remained in camp Sunday Obtained sight for time and lunar distances 28th Proceeded on a westerly course to my crossingplace in the creek of Camp 36 where we arrived about noon having avoided the pine scrub which we fell in with on our route from Creek 34 Latitude of camp 25 44 14 29th Continued our journey along my horse tracks and at 1h 30m AwM arrived at the Badger Creek Encamped at lh 35m PM at the waterhoe in the creek at a distance of 9 miles from our last nights camp in lat 25 40 15 S 30th Proceeded along the track for 4 miles and then left it to avoid a pine scrub  but failed in my attempt to find an open country At a distance of 7 miles came upon a flat which we folowed up to its head crossed the dividing range through a pine scrub I followed my horses tracks down a flat falling towards the Warrego At 4 PM encamped without water As we had observed smoke in the valley to the northward of our camp on two occasions IEwyedition into Central Australia 239 fully expeeted to find water but after a personal search was unsuccessful At 7 PM a native approached the camp with a  cooee but made oWas soon as he diseovered who we were another proof that there must be water ill the immediate neighbourhood July 1st At 8 AM our party were in motion alld at 27 miles we reached the downs of the VVarrego after a journey of 102 miles encamped on the river at the point where I made it on my return from the Nive 2nd Having 2 days journey to accomplish after leaving this uithout water we halted today on the Warrego In the morning I took a round of angles from the top of a hill bearingtrue 16 E distant 170 yds Obtained sights for variation at the same time found our latitude at noon to be 2U 27t 2t S var 9 40t E Two kangaroos were shot today one by Harry and the other by LuR These are the first we have observed on the Journey 3rd Cut our way through a brigalow scrub on the top of the range which divides the Warrego from the Nive and encamped after a journey of 11 miles on a NVV course in a flat by the side of a dry creek 4th Removed to the well on the Warrego about 5 miles in a NNW direction 3 more wells were dug from which we obtained an abundant supply of water Latitude by observation 25 20 7 S Took a tracing o the head of the Victoria and made preparations for an exeursion in search of a prae ticable route for the carts to the Victoria The thermometer this morning stood at 8 Fahrenheit after sunrise 5th Leaving instructions with Mr Turner to proeeed with the party to the waterhole I had founl in a creek at its junction with the sandy bed of a river I again took Douglas LuS and Harry with nle and started of to reconnoitre the eountry in the direction of the Victoria As Douglas who had accompanied Sir T Mitchell on all his exreditions N of Depot 2 could not remember the bed of any river resemblin the present except the Nive to whieh it was in all respects similar and as I had crossed a wellwatered creek intersecting plains at the position where I expected to all in with the War rego I still thought this river might be the Nive and aecordingly followed it up During the day it had taken several turns to the eastward g but I en camped in lat 25 6t 35t S about NNW of the depot without water 6th As the course of the river this morning commenced with a sharp turn from the W I still patiently followed it in the hope ot its preserving that course but 3uring our progress I found that its longest reaches came more decidedly from the E Mllch time was lost this morning in digging for water our horses not having hal any last night As we proceeded the channel became more bold and rocky in appearance indicating the vicinity of moun tains and at length after a journey of 10 miles we obtained M ater by digging in lat 25 1 30tt S our last nightts camp bearing about SW 7th As all hope had vanished of this river being the Nise I aseended a mountain this morning which bore by compass 103 from our camp distant 3 miles I found it lightly timbered but steep and rocliy evidently an ex tinet volcano having its cavity open to the westward Natives were encamped upon it whieh led me to expect that I should find water in the neighbourhood but although unsuccessful in my search I have little doubt there is some The weather beirlg showery I was unable to obtain a round of angles but observed Mounts Playfair Pluto and Hutton the former bearing 259 40 by compass distant 15 miles Coming again upon the sandy bed of the river at the Mount I traced it round to the spot where we had eneamped and in doing so came upon the tracks ot horses and bullocks confirming what nly angles had shown  This river was afterwards found to be the Warrego asld what I had supposed to be the Warrego all unnamed creekE B K240 Extzactsfrom the Journal of an exploring me that we were upon the VV7arrego Found several native camps along the banks of the river 8tA1 Travelled on a bearing of 2St in order to pass S of Mount PlayEair At 12 miles passed a wellutatered creek running SSW  and encountered a brigalow scrub on the S spur of the Mount Encamped la mile from its sum rnit the bearing 32 Our camp mas on a gully containing water in shallow holes evidently the effiects of the late rains 9th It rained heavily dllring the night but this morning 1 continued my journey on a bearing of 305 so as to cross the dividing range and come upon the source of the Nive In g hour we had passed through a brigalow spur on the side of the gully in which we had encamped and came upon an open forestcountry Crossed the Crino in an open flat containing a marked water course but with no water where we passed Encamped on a creek in lat 2oo 2t 19tt 10th Continued our journey and at a distance of 3 miles came upon the rocky brigalow scrub of Sir T Mitchell found the ascent rocky and impas sable for carts Picking our way along the top which was covered with pines and dead timber we followed down a watercourse the Nive and encalnped at a waterhole at the junction of the Nivelle 11th Rode to the brigalow creek contailling uater at its junction with the Nive distant 7 miles W of the Nivelle matered the horses and took my departure for the Gap on a bearing of 32U At a distance of 5 liles found the fall still to the northward and eastward and therefore kept more in a westelly direction in the expectatioll of falling in with a atercourse which would lead me to tIaplr Valley Ascending a remarkably isolated portion of a ridge which lay in our route I observed forestland extending for many miles in a northwesterly direction Immediately to the northmard of the hill was an open flat through which the creek ran and although from the dis tance we had travelled and the appearance of the country it was evident I had passed the Gap I enearllped in this flat there being a good suply both of grass and water I had just selected a site for our camp5 when a henrty laugh made us aware tbat we were in the neighbourhood of a party of natives and wishing lo ascertain their numbers I fired a shot on hearing M hich they rew moved to a distance ot about  mile Lat 24 49 30t S leth Concluding that Happy Valley must be about 4 miles WSW Of us and cut of by a high brigalow range I followell the flat down this Inorning for about l mile and thus gained the sumrnit of the range Traced our say along tbe top to the SW till we came in sight of the plains at the Gap with Eiappy Valley to the southward Took a sketch and bearing of the limits of the plains passed Camp 72 and returned to the Brigalow Creek on the Nivc rhe flat on which we encamped last night appears well watered and fiom its character and northwesterly direction the creek evidently flows into the Victoria 13th With the view of avoiding the rocky brigalow ridges at the head of the Nive I started on a bearing of 125 for my camp in lat 25 2t 19t For the first 7 miles we encountered a good deal of brialow and here entered an open forestcountry consistirlg of box and iron bark At l0 miles crossed a creek with a southerly direction with no water in it and a little farther on came upor another with a westerly course joining the first This I followed up as it gave me an open passage through a scrubby and broken country in an ESE direction At 13 miles came upon open forest land and at 1a the black boys horse being knocked up we encampedS without utater at the head of some rocky gullies concentring at the head of the Nive 14th tiontinued my course of 125 and after passing through an open brigalow scrub fol a distance of 3 or 31 miles arrived at a creek containing an abundant supply of water Here wc rested our horses for a collple of hoursEzpedition into Cenfral Australia 241 anl again proceeded through brigalow to my camp in lat 25 2t 19t having discovered a comparatively clear road for the carts to the Nivelle escaping the rocky ridges VVre should have reached Mount Playfair today had it not been for Harrys horse which was completely knocked up 1Sth Returned on my track to Mount Playfair avoiding the pine and brigalow scrllbs About noon it coInmcnced raining which prevented my getting beyond mT camp of the 8th 16th Started on a bearin of 130 for the camp on the VV7arrego where I had left my party At a distan e of l miles clossed a creek running to the S with an abundance of uater in it and about a mile farther on crossed the one at which ue had watered our horses on thc 8th At 7 miles encountered a brigalow scrub whicl1 threw me off my course to the eastward At 11 miles made the Warrego  and at 4 PM reached the carts found all well at the camp The natives had paid them a visit about 2 Al but finding the men on the alert had taken themselves oWagain 17th Took observations for variation on a hill NE of camp distant 400 yards and also took the bearing of Mount Playfair bom the same spot The variatiorl I found to be 1014 E Removed the camp to a uaterhole on the WYarrego in lat 2511 46 Observedthe distance between  and Antares Tile water at this and at the last camps may I think be called permanent con sisting of deep holes in sand at the junction of small creeks with the river flom the eastward The true bearing of Mount PlayEair from the hill7 near the last camp

of birds collected up to this date 5X and of animals 7 Observed the distance between sun and moon and ob tairled si2ghts for time  plotted my late route c 19th troceeded touards my camp S of Mount Playfair in a NNW direction At a distance of 2 miles came upon my return tracks which we followed for some time and then quitted them keeping more to the westward to pass through what appeared to be tlse most open countrv Having suc ceeded in avoiding Illuch of the brigalow scrub seen on my return we passed throlJgh a short but thick casuarina scrub I again got upon my return tracks when we kept a course ot 310 to a creek falling to the southward and west ward in lat 25 7 8 We found the bed of this creek so soft that it became necessary to tether ths horses uater boiled repeatedly at 210 thermometer 38 and 44 20tJI Moved aIong my return track in a WNW direction At 2 miles passed my bivouac of the 8th and crossing a brigalow ridge came upon an open sandy forest which we traversed for 5 miles when we encountered a dense brigalow scrub through which we had to cut our way Followed my returntracks to a creek flowing SW in lat 25 1 47 about 1i miles SSE Of the brigalow l idge mexltioned in my instructions Reached otLr camping ground at sunset 21st We were aetained this morning until E past 10 oclock by Douglas svho lost his way in the brigalow while looking for the horses Started tor the Nivelle and Nive and at 1 miles crossed the brigalow ridgeX at about T mile S from the place where Sir T Mitchell crossed it On attaining the top of the ridge we kept along the upper part ot the fall to the Nive in as northerly a direction as the absence of scrub would admit of At 8 miles we touched upon my tracks of the l0th and being now sure that we were cIear of serub I kept a northwesterly course until we reached the junction of the Nivelle The latitude obtained from the double altitude of Arcturlls is 24 53t 30tB the same as charted by Sir T Mitchell from an observation of a south star 24 54 4 22xtd lroceeded on a WSW course this morning to the water in Br YOL XX1 I  R242 EnctrcGcts from the Journal of an efiplorzag galow Creek where we eneamped at 11 h 30m At

scrllb vwe had e2mperienced on two previous occasions we travelled down the Nive for 2 miles before striking of fbr the Gap Be did not succeed how everS in effecting our object for we had to cut our way throllgh a dense brigalow scrub and dd not reach the valley till 4 PM It has taken llS 6 weeks to attain this point from Camp a9 but my horses were recruiting their strength 3 M eeks of that time while I M as absent reconnoitritlg and wrere consequentlythen with the exception of three or four in excellent condition Not being able to affiord flour a mess of sago was given to the men to com memorate ollr arrival on the Victoria 24th Followed down the vfatercollrse at present containing water in every hole At 4l rniles got upon the magnificent plains of the Victoria and guided by Sir T Mitchells survey I was enabled to cut oS all bends and pre serve a westerly course until we touched upon the river about a mile SE of the first creek Iaid dowll by Sir T Mitchell as coming from the N and 9 mile from Happy Valley This is undoubtedly the finest collntry I have seen in Australia the splendid reaches of water in every bexld of the river and the exquisitely gleen plainsJ presenting a

jOUPIXeY cxf 9 miles The channel of the river here is much divided and the water is in scattered holes and I think it very doubtful whetherue should find any in a dry season Lat 240 ASt 10 2Sth Continued our journey across plains u ith long strips ot serub in some places our course was generally WNW At 10 miles came upon the river where it takes a sudden turn to the northward and at 1112 miles encamped upon its banks Our course today was pretty straight and although we passed many dense scrubs and much Acacia forest our rvad was generally clear We did not cross the rivera but travelled down its lett bank if such it can bc called having no well marked bed but divided channels Worked my lunar of the 26th instant which places my camp of that evening in long 145 56 45 E and lat 24 52 52t S this position is 28 miles W of that gYen by Sir rr Mitchell 29th Travelled over downs in a NW clirection to avoid the berld which the river here takes to the northward At about 5 miles touched on its south angle and then kept a westerly course for 6 miles and encamped upon the fine reach laid down by Sir T Mitchell I imagine the river must have received between this and the last evenings camp some considerable tributary from the direction of Mount Northampton for the character of its bed is quite changed instead of clay holes7 it has a broafl gravelly channel with reeds and lon reaches of water Lat 24 37t 10 S and about 3 miles E of Sir  Mitchells eamp 30th Continued our journev along the pains S of the river in a WNV9Expedtion into Central Australia 243 direction for 9 or 10 milesl when the northern hill of Mount Enniskillen bore SE we then turned more to the northward through brigalow to find the river and at about a quarter of a mile reached it but here it divided into a number of small dry chanllels At about 15 miles in a M esterly direction we eneamped on the S bank of the river which is in this place little else than a broad sheet of sand obtained water in small hcles on the N side as well as in a creek three quartcrs of a mile Sw of the camp 31st Proceeded in a NW direction for tm over plains at that distance uTe came upon the river but so cut up into small dry creeks or utatercoursesy that I uas at a loss vwhich to consider the main channel keeping between several af them we eneamped at 10 miles on a plain bordering on what I believed to be the principal channel where tllere was a long hole containing xTery old water The appearance of the country is parcheel and arid and it seems to have suffiered much from drought August 1st Remained in camp In looking for the horses this morning the men liscovered water in several holes in the neighbourhood so that there will be no uant of a supply on our return Otl examining the contents of the carts I find we should have but 1343 lbs to carry on each holse1 werc sle to leasTe tiX cart3 behind and as the season is far advanecd and 1 am ansious to mlke as much progress as possible in carrying out my instruetions within the tropics7 I have decided on burying them and anttthing else we can dispense uTith so soon as I can find a suitable spot Natives were seen today in a brigalow scrub by the men in search of the horses 2Sdo After rounding an angle of the river we trarrelled over plails in a NX0r direction tor 5 rniles then crossed it and traversed another plain in a NW alld  direction At 12 miles kept a W course towards the river and cncamped on its N bank in lat 24 20 59t S The evening was cloudy uith eltery appearance of rain but at 9 PM it cleared up there was a waterhole in the river where we crossed it and several where we encamped 3rd Finding by this mornings observation that we were irl the latitude of Sir T Mitchells camp of the 28th of September I sent Douglas and the black boy down the river to try and find out his camping ground At a distance of 250 yards they came upon horse tracks approachillg the river from the north ward which I afterwards examined and as I10 other traces were discernible I imaine they must have been upon the site M7ishing to trace the southern most channel laid dovYn by Sir T Mitchell I crossed the river and kept along it for about 5 miles in a VVNW direction but at that distance the scrub lJecame so thick I vfas compelled to travel again along the N side and en camped in lat 24 17t 36 4th Kept a westerly course over plains of a dry cracked clay upon which were scattered a few stunted trees their general height being about 24 feet had a creek in sight of us to the right all daa and finding at 10 miles that a scrub intercepted us and the branch we had left wc turned to the northward and at a quarter of a mile canle upon the creek which had been running parallel with us There was no water where we made it but having found some a short distance up we encamped in lat 24 15 30ti S Variation of compass 6 56 E The appearance of the country travelled over today was arched the plains in sorne places being destitute of all vegetation and they ares or have been subject to inundation as is evident from the numerous shels and muscles to be found in all parts of them the various channels into which the Victolia is divided in this portion of its course bear eviderst marks of the country having suffiered flom a long drouglst water is excessively scarce and many deep holes are now dry 5th Conceiving myself to be now at that point of the Victoria at mhich it makes a circuitous turn frotn the northward or in other words at the eastern eutremity of the bend alluded to ill my instructions anel considering flom the 2244 Ewtracts from the Journal of an eploring great scarcity of water and consequently of game that this would be a favourable spot for burying the carts and such other portion of our equipment as we could dispense with I instructed Mr Turner to have 6 months tea and 4 months sugar paeked in bags for the greater facility of carrying on pack and to make the other necessary arrangements NVith this view I also set the blacksmith to work to turnish each horse with a good set of shoes which with a spare set will it is anticipated carry them to the Gulf and back again without injury The men were instructed to make a search up the creek for water and also to look out for a sandy piece of ground  whilst taking Douglas and the blaek boy with me I rode in a northerly direction in the hope of recognizing one of Sir T Mitchells camrs in this I was unsuccessful but found that we mere encamped upon the northernmost branch of the river although upon the southern channel of that branch which here consists of 3 or 4 distinct channels On my way back to the camp I selected a spot fol burying the carts I this evening read Leichhardts lecture by wrhich I find that there is a probability of our meeting and that it is his intention to run the Albert up to its source which is I hope in this part of the country I savv today two of the largest kangaroos I ever met with they were of a yellowish red colour very similar to that of the native dog with blaek iaces and their height vhen sitting up could not have been less than 7 feet 6th The men commenced digging a pit for the carts this morning but at the depth of a foot the soil became so hard that it wa3 evident they would be unable to sink it the required depth under 3 or 4 days which time we could not well spare I accordillgly selected a more sandy spot about 250 yards E Of our camp and 4 men were busily engaged during the day in excavating it but on visiting the hole in the evening I ound that at 2 feet from the surface the ground became too hard for the spades and that our pickases would have to be put in requisition the soil contiuued sandy mixed svith quartz pebbles our water was fast falling or evaporating under a temperature of 96 in the shade and this being a case of necessity I determined upon joining the men in the morning Mr Turner being too unwell to admit of his working with the hope ot getting the hole ready by the following evening 7th All hands employed in sinkint the pit which was required to be 24 feet long by 11 broad and 6 deep worked hard all day and at sunset had the gratification ot seeing it ready to receive the carts 8th Buried the carts with the harness spare trappings c 270 lbs of sugar and a sufficierlt proportion of tea At 11 AM when the pit was nearly filled in Ilarry came running to us with the intelligence that the natives mere in pursuit ot our horses Haxing no arms on the spot I despatched two men to the camp for some but before doing so directed the shole party to give a loud shout which had the desired effect ot causing them to desist rom their pursult and imagining from our voices that we were a large party the dust raised by the gallopillg ot the horses havieg coneealed us from their xiew they thought proper atter a time to retire In the evening the pit was well covered in and trampled upon whilst Harry rode round the edge ofthe scrub to guard against our being watched We were obliged to keep the horses on tether all night 9th The loads being new to the men we did not finally leave our encamt ment until noon Kept a S 86 W course as near as possible over soft acacia plains occasionally diverging a little t avoid the scrub At 4 miles encamped upon the S branch of the river uhere we found abundance of water but a veryscantysupIly of grass Mr Turnerstillcontinuedunuellandanother of the party Luff complainedXtilis morning of a disordered stomach Latitude by observation 24 14 44 S This branch of the river is here divided into 6 channels the centre one I should say is seldom dry 10th ContiIlued the same course as mell as the scrub  ould permit TheEtpedition into Central Australia 24o country travellel over today was undulating7 of a soft crumbly soil uith here and there open downs interspersed with acacia and rosesvood scrubs Frum the appearance of the downs which are strewed with dead timber and from their being in many places covered with pebbles and fossil wood it is evident that at some time or another they must have formed one wastserub At 12 miles we encamped upon the river trom the southward as laid don7vn by Sir Thomas Mitchel1 and foutld abundance of water the river from all appear ance having only ately ceased to flo  its channel is rocky and tbe rocks are of a very hard and closegrairled sandstone 11th Proceeded on our journey in a vvesterlt direction over a sery simiar country to that travelled over yesterday athough for the first 8 miles the scrubs were more frequent and longer but at the same time comaratively open At 8 rlliles we crossed a shallow creek fallinffl to the northmrard and at 18 miles crossed a stil smaller one with a similar direction when we came upon oen downs covered by the most luxuriant pasture At 18 miles having been induced to travel thus far by the fine appearance of the country we encamped without water on the W side of an extensive plain the open lzassages of ground between the scrubs seen during the last few days resemblcd the eleared grounl on the Hunter mrhere the trees have been killed by stripping them of their bark from the quantity of dead timber strewn over the ground it woud appear that the scrubs are fast decayinz and their place sul1y1ied by lains At present these newly made Illains are of a light and poor description of soil 1out as the dead timber disappears the soil improves from which 1 think we may infer that they undergo a chanze tor the better as the absence of uood marks the greater affle of the plain V e heard the lllek Gluck bird spoken of by Leichhardt seen by Sir Thomas Mitchells party for the first tinze to day since leaving the Maranoa vvhere oil this journey I only heard it once 12th Considering the variation to be 79 E ue kept a westerly course the clumpsof scrub vYeresmallerandnotso dellseas thoseseenyesterdayand the plains were covered with a most lusuriant vegetation At 8 miles we came 1lpon the dom ns near Yaranigh Lagoons the chain of which lagoons we crossed shortly after and found them dry At 1 miles entered a stony forest scrub but finding it too rough for the horses altered our course a little to the northuard and again came upon the drr chain of lagoons Riling along the S sicte in a westerly direction ure found horse dung7 but not being able to dis cover any tracks and Douglas not recognizing the spot which is here a dry marsh running E arld W we proceeded upon a WNW course to the river where we erleamped and singular enough close to the camp and about e of a mile from the spot where we first saw horsedung more was found for the latter I am quite unable to account as Sir Thos Mitchell crossed the river op posite to a scrub and kept wide of it until he encamped upon the 28th of Sep tember Hele the banks of the river are clear anel it has several deep chan nels in the turo southernmost of which a flood appears to have lately taken place Lat 2416t 33 S 13th Followed the course of the river for 3 miles and crossed it about the same spot as Sir T Mitchell did on his returnJ Kept a mesterly course over the most beautiful downs with here and there a c11lmp of si1verleaf brialow  thc country about here appears to be clad in gold so thickly is it covered with luttercups and other spring flou ers After travelling 10 miles we arrived at a creek running SSW to join the main rivers and as a brigalow serub con fined it on the W we ran it down and at 2 miles reached the river running in a southwesterly direction and here divided into 3 channels Latitude 24 17 34 VVe encamped upon the nlidlle channel all thrce containel u ater but the southernmost one was the deepest and at its junction with this about a mile below our camp there is a fine deep reach 14th Proceeeled upon our journer keeping within sight of the rlorthern246 Etracts from the Journal ef an eacploring most channel with a viesv of travelling as little to the southward as possible and meeting the S channel W of the bend which it appeared to take in a southerly direction At the distance of a mile we crossed tsvo deep lagoons but one of which only contained water and that apparently not to be depende upon At about 4 miles came upon the northwestern channel at a deep though stnall reach and crossing just below it rode to a sandhill which approached close to the river and seemed to be the northwestern boundary of these waters From the hill the top of a ridge running N and S was discernible at a distance of about 2 miles confining these waters on the E and S side  at 9 miles we encamped on what I considered to be the centre channel in lat 24 24 47t S 1Sth Impatient to examine the opposite limit of this most extraordinary valley I left the camp at daybreak with the black boy Harry and kept an ESE course towards the highest part of the losv range We crossed the range which these waters intersect at 3 miles and then ascended a scrubby ridge streved with rounded pebbles formed of a very hard rock We pelle trated the scrub on rising grollnd until I thought that we had attained the highest point of the ridge although the bush was too thick to afford me a good view This low rane appeared to extend parallel to others of the same de scription vvhich are cnnected with it in the direction of NNE and SSW In vain did I look for high land to the southwardX or some indication of a change in the collrse of the valley The tall u as most provokingly evident to the south vfard I should mention that between the camp and this ridre there are three watercourses all containing M ater but so shallow that it is evident the channel upon which we are eneamped is the main one IIarry observed several llants during yesterdaAs journey which belong more properly to salt lakes I thoutht it worth while on my return to the camp to reperuse the account of Captain Sturts expedition published in the 4 South Australian Gazette andv the result is that I am convinced that we are now upon Coopers zreek de scribed by the natives as having its source or rather as being divided into many branches above nvhere they were The river has been making directly for the point where Captain Sturt turned back on Coopers Creek ever since it was turned in its northerly course by Sir T Mitchell 16th With some anxiety lest I should follow this treacherous river too far S to enable me to carry out the second duty irnposed upon me namely that of finding a practicable route to the Gulf of Carpentaria I continued my jour ncy down it still considering it possible it might take a favourable tuln and that the broken range to the southYlard and eastward might once be the barrier between Sturts desert and this and gve rise to Cooper1s Crcek At 1 miles passed a fine reach of water and at 2 miles passed a lagoon on the right situated under a low brigalow ride in the centre of a pretty flat Keepinr the eastern channel of the river on our right we traversed ope21 plains with here and there a clllmp of brigalow At 7 miles sighted two remarkable and isolated hills bearing about SE and the point of a brigaIow ridte NW dis tant 2 miles At 10 miles touched upon the river here divided into a nuln ber of shallow and dry channels hounded on the W by the stony brigalow ridge7 of the northern extremity of which I had taken a bearing Scarcely crediting that the river could have thus dwindled away I left the party on the easteln bank and rode through the scrub on the ridge for the purpose of ascertaining if it concealed from view the main channel but not satisficd with my search I sent a man to the point of the ridge to see if he could discover any traces of it in a northwesterly direction At 12 miles we encamped between two of its llrincipal channels 1he man I had lespatched to the ridge returned at sunset and reported that he llad found hifflh ground on the W bank above where the ridge confines the river at 24 33 49 S  the course of the river today has been about 15 W of S 17th Traveled down the river oYer a very thinly woocled collntry the voilEzpedition into Central Australia 247 is a poor white clay but there is no want of grass although during the last 3 days it has appeared withered and parebed up We kept betsveen two of the principl channels daring the greater part of the day but in the afternoon crossed them and reached a brigalow ridge whicb bounds them on the western side Being satisfied as to which was the principal channel M e turned towards it and eneamped at 13 miles in lat 24 43 40t The rilers course today was about SSW 18th Pursued our journey down the river over a lightlytimbered country bounded on either side by low brigalow lidges alternately abutting on the E and W side of the main channel The plains had at one time been inundatetl and are strewed ith spiral shells These are also intersected by dry beds oi small lakes and lagoons  and another remarkable kature is the total absence of trees of any size except on the banks of a sater courseor dry lagoon We encamped this evening on a small waterhole in the river which is here split into countless channels 19th The course of the river having kept so steadily to the SSW and it being here so divided in its channels I last evening came to the resolution of not taking rny larty anar further down it  the principal object ot the journey in the words of my instruction beint the determination of the course of the Victoria and a consenient route to the hcad of the Gulf of arpentaria  I nevertheless felt that I could not leave the river untraeed in any latitule N ot 26 but to attain that point with my party and afterwards proceed to the gulf was an ilpossibility with my stook of provisions which consisted of somewhat less than 7 months consumptiorl at an allowance of 75 lbs of flour per week I therefore propose tracing it dovwn to that latitude 26 with tuo men when if it preserses its present couase I shall be within 2 days ride of Sturts position on Coopers Creek and will therl Ieave the river and make directly touards it On attaining that point I hope the overnment will consder that I have carried out the first part of my instructions and satisfac toraly determined the course ot the Victoria It is then my intention to pro ceed to the NW angle of the river traced by Sir T Mitchell and search to the NNV of that osition br a river leading to the northward Obtained a set of equal altitudes aso sights for time by single altitude took the distance between  and  and Fomalhaut and obtained the latitude by north and sollth stars 24 52 51 20th LeSt the camp at sunrise with DouglasX LuS and Harry At 12 rniles halted and had breakfast In that distance we passed 3 native camps observable by the smoke of their fires From the last one 3 or 4 mer came out and shouted after us but they were at too great a distance to admit of nly speaking to them although I mas desirous to do so Before we left the spot where we breakfasted 3 came up armed with their spears aIld nulla nullas but were so shy tllat it was a long while lefore we could get near enough to converse We exchanged presentsf and they appeared to under stanel our questions as to the course of the river for they made a sB vep with their hands in a southerly direction Tlley were about 5 feet 7 inches in height were oIy scarred across thc chest and all three were deficient in a front tooth They cfarried Srreen boughs as emblems of peace and as tbey approached threw their spears behind them to show that they wele friendly i ut it was only when I had taken up a stick and gone through the same cere tnolly that they would allovY me to come near them they however licked up their wcapons and held them during the interview Continuing our ride in a SSW lirection I found towards sunset tnat I must change my course to MIrSW in order to make the river and after a journey of 25 miles en camped upon a reach of water rhis is the first day that the course of the riser has taken a direction to the westvvard of SSW for any length 21st Continued my ride down the proper left bank of the rivcr crossed it218 Ewtracts from the Journal of an ezploriy just above where a steep red mount at the northwestern extremity of a range abuts on its S Icank  thc river here maintairls a course 60 W ot S At 10 miles turned towards the river and found a reach of water in its channel upwards of 120 yards in uidth keeping near the bank in about a quarter of a mile we reached the end of the reach t a point where the eastern bank is strewn with rocks and pebbles and into which the back urater from the river has made consilerable inroads Below this I found the bed of the river dry and crossed it expecting to find another channel falling more to the south ward for I could scarcely credit the sudden and rapid change in the apear ance of the river Finding no other I turned towards the channel I had crossed and at 18 miles recrossed the river here dry and divided into seve ral channels and encamped in lat 25 111 51 By the unexpected westerlv turn of the river I bund myself in the evening 48 N of the position I had intended to makc and would have made in 3 days had the rivel continued it3 usual course I felt much at a loss how to act for this change estending perhaps for a very short distance left in doubt that which it was one of the principal obJects of my journey to determine On second thought however I decided on proceedingas it was still possible that the river mifflht disem bogue in tlle gulf although the chances are against it the only one indeed sn favour of such a supposition being the rocky nature of its southern bank 22nd Before sunrise we nvere in the saddle travelling down the right bank of the river At about a quarter ot a mile it took a turn to the north ward of W and was uinding through rocky plains or more properly speak ing had made a channel through a rocky ridge slightly elevated above the plains this aprleared to me to be the spot likely to deterrnine the course of the river The range which had abutted on the river to the S a isv miles higher up had receded but its influence was clearly not yet lost plains extended on buth sides except on its immediate banks which as I have already said were of a rocky character The river pursued its svesterly course for about 3 miles vvhen a reach which had commenced near our last nights encampment opened out into a fine sheet of water from 100 to l 20 vards wide with rocliy fords similar to those on the Balonne At 7 miles the river took a short turn to the NW and then as far as I followed W by N inclining to the nortb vYardv At 10 miles the reach of water still continued it was here 145 yards wide and apparently very deep it intersected open tvlains with air pasture but with an extremely poor svhite clay soil 23ad On a bearing of N 70 E I returned towards the camp feeling per fectly satisfied that it was my duty to follow such a river whatever direction it might take At 4 miles I changed my course to N 60 E and at 16 miles encamped on the river having cut oSthe long bend it takes to the southmard 24th Reached the camp at sunset and had the pleasure of finding exery thing as I had left it 2Sth Conducted the party 13 miles down the river7 and encamped on a fine sheet of water the day was elolldy with a strong wind rom the north ward distant thunder was heard in the evening and rain appeared to fall in the direction of the Sv 26th Proceeded on our journey at a quicker pace than usual in consequence of all the men but two being now mounted At 12 miles crossed the river alld following it clown on the right bank encamped on a noble sheet of water after a journey of 14 miles A few jewfish mere caught this afternoon lighter in colour and lollger than those found ill thc BaIonne we also caught another kind of fish resembling bream but with a different head 27th Followed my trackst cutting off the southern bend of the river and encamped on the 10 mile reach after a journey of 15 miles 28th Again tot upon my tracks and followed them to where I had last encamped The river is here 120 to 140 yards wide with rocky islands atEzlvedition tnto Central Allstralia 249 a mile below the place u7here we encamped there is a rocky ford at which a party of natives had taken up their quarters on my tormer visit and where they remainedt notwithstanding our vicinity 29th Remained in camp and worked the lunars of the lSth instant by which I made the long of that camp 144 19 E and the lat 24 52 51 S 30th In the hope that the river was taking a fivourable turn to the north ward we started this morning on a westerly course At 9 miles we neared it7 hut at 14 left it some distartce to our left and came upon a consideralle river from the NNE vvith a broad ed and a continuous reach of water about 50 yards across upon which we encamled after a jourlcy of 15 miles in lat 2S 9 13 lhe last l1 miles of this days journey had been overa dead flat or plain subject to inllndation it consists of a white clay blistered and cracked and totally devoid of vegetation this apparently dry bed of a lake or sea is bounded on the N side by low red sanly dunes and over it are scatterexl a few dwarf trees of from 6 to 20 feet in height whieXh atpear to have suffered from a long drought it seems a pity so nluch water shoulel intersect SQ worthless a country I could not help observing this evening how very few birds were isible in the neighbourhood ot our eneampment 2 or 3 crogs or ducks were all that were to be seen 31st Proceeded on our journey crossed the new river at its junction with an inferior branch of the Victoria and for abollt lO miles kept a course 5 to the northward of W At that distance I found mt7self on some irregular sandy elevations the river not in sight and a low ridge extending nearlv N and S in front of me I then changed my course to S 15 W for 2 miles and not finding the river kept due S br thc same distance then S l5 E and lastly S 70 E until I made the river across a plain in 32 miles and cncamped at 7h 30m PM on its right bank The greater part of this days journey has been over extensive plains intersected by deep fissures and cracks bare of all vegetation and ot a loose crumbling soil September 1st Corltinued to trace the main channel of the river through a most llreary desert At 5 miles the low ridge or range that I siChted in the W vesterday morning closed in upon the river It is stony and covered with a brigalow scrub The rocks rendered it difficult to travel on the right bank but lest the river should discharge any of its waters to the northward unobserved we advanced slowly over them 1at 25 24 48 S long from mean of two observations of  and  2 and Saturn and Moon 142 58 45 E 2nd At the distance of about 2 a mile from our last nights camp the stony ridge closed in again upon the river mhich here dividel into a number of minor channels Selecting the westernmost one I traced it for 8 miles but finding the channel dry and traversing a desert without any sirns of vegeta tion 1 turned to the SE and E and at 4 miles having crossed a number of dry channes wc encamped at 7 PM on the principal one here reduced lo a few shallow pools In travelling down the western ehannel our party was approached by a numiver of natises unarrned they were a fine rae of men little scarred and wanting two frorzt teetAt We made them presents and they accompanied us until we turned to the eastFard which movement ap peared to cause them great uneasiness or they began to cooee and talk very loud evidently desiring us not to go that way Knowing that the main channel was to my left I coneludetl tilfdt their uxp must be in that direction and that they were afraid of ollr approaching it and consequently paying no attention to them I turned my horse as if to gallop at them when they took their delearture On crossing the dry channels homever1 we observed several deserted huts on their banks and I am now inclined to think that their intentions were friendly and that knowing that we should not find water for scme distance in thc course wc were pursuing they intended to con250 Extracts from the Journal of an exploring duct us to some hole near their camp 1 his makes the fourth night that our horses have been obliged to go without grass for not a blade is visitJle in ally direction 3rd rhis morning before starting we had a visit from a party of the young men and boys belonging to the trilJe we met yesterday they appeared generally speaking to be an openhearted goodlooking set and as their visit was evidently dictated by curiosity we treated them kindly and made them presents They accompanied us br some distance on our journey the boys laughing immoderately at the movements of the horses and at about 2 miles quitted us and we saw no more of them At 8 miles I sent Luff to look into the channel on which the natives were eneamped distant about W of a mile He found a little water but no grass and we therefore turned more to the eastward and crossinfr the main channel here more than ever cut u and dividedwe encamped upon a small waterhole which we succeeded in finding after great difficuty As me were now within a fortnights journey of Coopers Creek I had 400 lbs of flour and 70 lbs of sugar buried in order to mollnt all the men and lighten the horses as much as possible Lat 25 43 44 4th Continued our journey over much the same description of country as uc had beeI travelling over for the last few days Ath Remained in camp and buried 270 lbs of flour 6th Scarcely knowing uhich to consider the n1ain channel we pursued a westerly course with the view of keping the river between us and the range to the eastward At 3 miles we crossed an infilsite number ot channels and we then resumed a southuesterly direction At 5 miles touched upon the river below the junction of several of the creeks and where there is a standing reach of water At 11 miles came again upon the river and here it was divided into a number of channels but in one of them some small but I think constant holes of vvater were found Encamped in lat 25 54t 15tt rhe country travellel over today bore much the same aspect as the other portion of the desert through which we had passed it was wholly destitute of vege tation but we were fortunate in finding a few tufts of grass in the ereek near the camp which atiorded our horses a seanty meal 7th Following the main channel of the river we encamped after a journey of 8 miles at two very small waterholes without food for our horses The ground travelled oxer today was worse than ever the horses falling up to their kllees at every step The channels of the river have become very small and scattered and contain but ittle water Lat 26 0 13 8th Having observed from the top of a tree last night that the course of the principal ereeks was to the southvzard I this morning preserved a dlle S course and arlived at sunset at a deep channel at which some time pre viouslyX a large party of natives appear to have been encamped it was now hourever dry and after a close search we could find neither grass nor wrater for the horses Lat 26 13 49 S 9th laking LuS and the black boy with me I rode up the creek in search of water but found all the holes completelar dry I then crossed over to the last channel between us alld the mountains but was equally unsllecessfiul On returning to the camp I despatched Harry and l5ielch to examine tlle crcek downwarel and several others to the westward but they found by the tracks of the natives that they were travell3ng from ilole to hole remaining at each only so long as the water lasted Our horses being now nearly knocked up from vvant of food and water butmore particularly of the former I deemed it imperative upon me to fall back witnhollt loss ot time upon the holes we had lett on the preceding day The party started at 1 PM and did not reach the camping ground until after dark I follovved at 2 PM With Harry but ouing to the weak state of our horses it took us 61 hours to reach the camp distantExpedition into Central Australiv 251 only 13 miles rhis being the lowest point we attained on the river I before starting this morning marked a tree on the N side and cut E8K7 on it In our ride today we passed a large tribe of natives that had just arrived from the mountains they hadtaken possession of a waterhole and would not allow two of our party who tried to look illtO the creek to go near it as it was not the spot where we intended to encamp the party moved on At 9 miles I foulld Niblett sitting by the side of his horse old Dozey who was completely knocked up he had entered the desert an invalid and seeing that there was no hope of saving him and that our own horses would scarcely be able lo reach the water I desired Niblett to shoot hirn Arrived at the camp at 830 PM l0th Marking the camp IK we moved towards our position of the 6th but although the distance was not above 9 miles our horses were so exhaustel from want of food that e could only craul orl at the rate of about a mile an hour I was oblired to dismount and lead mine and after a fatiguing days journey we at length reached the water and the only patch of grass in the desert The tracks of the natives have been very numerolls during the last 2 or 3 days and some were observed watching our slow progress over the plains Eight natives came up to the camp in the afternoon they were shorter and not so goodlooking as the others we had seen and made a noise in imitation of the crow They appeared friendly but as we took but little notice of them and would not allow them to go near the camp they soon took their departure 11th This morning about laybreak tmTo natives were observed hy the man on sentry sneakillg along the creek endeaouring to steal my lhedolite stand which happened to be near the bank but on being discovered they took to their heels In the aftelnoon the king and all his tribe came up to whom we made presents Vfith some difficulty I made them urlderstand that I wished thern to let one of the boys come with mc upon which they sent them all avvay lest I suppose we should take them by force A curious fact I observed here is that the men chew tobacco it is of course in a green state but it is stronz and hot I also observed that they approached us vvithout fear and completely unarmed I refer to the natives we have met sinee our arrival beyond the rooky reach of watcr or in other words since we entered the desert IIaited today to recruit our horses 12th Ourhorses being still unabletotravel weremainedin camp anl I availed myself of the opportunity to examine the reach urlder the range and a dry channel to the northviard this reach is rnore shallow than those we have seen above and as I expected divides and splits into several small channels but in vain did I search in them for vater 13th The hor3es were brought up and preparations made to recommence ollr retreat from the desert but findint that they were still wretchedly weak I removed the calup to the reach distant 1Q2 miles to the castsvard to enable them to havc a days feed in the bed ot the river before llndergoing four days total abstinence On the way to the rcach  Harpee one of the pack horscs fell down from sheer weakness I walked considering it would be cruel to ride my horsc in its present state Marked this camp III 14th On a bealiIlg of 60 E of N we proceeded to our camp of the 4th not beinC able to keep more to the eastward on account of a rocky ride which runs parallel to the river at a distance of from 1 to 2 miles At 5 rniles we were met by three natives svho with their tribe were encamped on the reach to the westward of us but they evidently did not wish to have anythirlg to say to us beyond alesiring that e should go on our way Uon crossing2o2 trtracts from the JournaZ of an exploring over to the right bank of the river r observed nearly sufficient feed for the horses in its bed and we therefore erscamped after a journey of 8 miles as there was no grass at our camp of the 4th 15th Continued our journey picked up the flour which had been buried at our caml of the 4th of September and proceeded on a bearing of 20 E Of N At 9 miles we encamped upon a small patch of grass I had noticed and shown in my survev distant about 3 miles from our camp of the 3rd At the campinground we passed this morning vve disturled some natives  they hid themselves until we had dug up our flour but just before we left they came up and ordered us away My norses strength being somexvhat recruited I was enahled to ride him occasionally today I this morning made up my mind to accompany my party as far as the place where the carts were buried and thence make the journey to the Gulf of Carpentaria with Niblett and Costigan sending the rest of the expeditiorl back to Sydnev under the charge of Mr Turner We have now 1690 lbs of flour so that I shall be able to start svith nearlv 8 months provisions at an allowance of 10 lbs perman and spare 500 lbs to the returningF party hich will be more than sufficient to carry them to the stations Although I feel great pleasure at the Irospect of accomplishing this the second and main object of the expedition and consider any risk I may personally incur as nothing compared with the putllic good I lsave my doubts whether I am not puttino the services of my rnen to too severe a test but they one and all express their readiness to undertake it anel I therefore only hope the result may be proportioned to their deserts So far as I am concerned I shall doubtless be blamed for taking tElis step but no consideration can induce me to return to Sydney until I shall have made every possible eSort to carry out the whole object of my mission 16th Moved forward to our encampment ot the 3rd upon arriving at which I dismounted Bith nuch satisfaction on perceiving the undisturbed ashes of a fire over the hole in which uTe had buried our flour Leaving the men to open the pit and get the flour I consulted with Niblett as to the arratlgements necessary to the accomplishment of our contemplated journey to the Gulf and while in the act of making a memorandum of the different articles we should require and the number of paokhorses that would be necessarv I was told that the rats had been at the flour This gave me but little concern as I knew that all they coull have consumed would be but a trifling loss but in a few moments the extent of our misfortune uas disclosed by the discosTerv that the natives and not the rats hal been at the flour they had opened the pit and had taken away the tarpaulirls and bags together witll the shoeinghammer c they had emptied the flour and sugar into the hole strewn a little straw ow er them and then filled up the pit again with as much care as we had bestowed upon it and the better to disguise it had kindled a fire over the spot in the same manner as we had done The damaffle done was great out of 400 lbs of flour 100 lbs only vwere collected clean and fit for use the remainder leing half flour and half clay This loss I had partly anticipated when in my anxiety to reach Captain Sturts position on Coopers Creek I had ordered it to be buried as we had sufficient without it to carry us there and back to Sydney but my last nights project of an expedition to the Gulf vs as by it ab ruptly terminatel for the quantity destroyed was equivalent to 10 weeks supply upon which I had calculated and I did not consider it prudent to attempt the journey with less than 8 months provisions that being as short a time as mre could expect to do it in Were I unsuccessful I knew that I should be cen sured for having divided and lett my pal ty  and to take less than a ration of 10 lbs of flour per man each vreek lllld be insufficient for the extra fatigue anl toil to which we should be subjected by day anl tlle constant match by night These considerations induced me to ahandon the attempt and detel mine upon returning to headquarters with the conviction that I had usedEzyedition irzto Central Australicl 953 every effort in my power lo carry out my instructions Obtained sights fr time and the distance between the Moon and Saturn 17th Removed the camp to about a mile N of our position on the evening of the 2nd where the water appears permanent though not to any great depth Tzo of the horses were driven in by their riders today with swoller glands and other indications of the strangles In the course of our march to day we observed several native fires although no natives themselves were visible 18th Cutting oW all bends we encamped on the river under tEle rocky ridge  a mile N of our camp of the 1st Obtained sights for time and took the distance between Moon and Saturn Sun and Moon and Moon and Fomal haut latitude 25 24 19 Tlle river here is divided into nutnberless ehannels our camp being on the westernmost one this camp I numbered  it will be easily recognised being situated irl a small bay formed by the stony ridge which closes in upon the river in latitude 25 24 22  19th Remained irl camp and allowed our horses to feed on the best grass the desert can produce If in any season a blade ot grass be left in

encamped upon our old ground of the 1st Sevtember Received a visit from a party of natives consisting of three men a uin and a little loy they were quiet at first1 but afterwards became very troublesome and we had some difficulty in getting rid of them I endeavoured by means ot presents an axe and two shawls to itlduce the parents to let me have charge of the boy but was unsucceqsfui Latitude 25 1S 9 21st At dawn this mornin we received another visit from our native friends vwhom with great difficulty we kept away from the tents They were inclined to be very troublesome attributing our forbearance to fear but at length we made a start and left them and in order to show them that we were friendly I made the eldest and bestbehaved a presexlt of an axe on leaving On our arriving at the new river vre were again met and followed by a rarty of natives who kept adding to their number as they proceeded Considering it might be curiosity which induced them to follow us I halted the party and dismounting showed them the men and horscs and allowed them to examine me atter this we again moved on and I made signs to them to leave us but in vain Instead therefore of encamping at the junction as I had originally intended I deemed it advisable to proceed rather than run the risk of a collision Blind to all hints and orders they still colltinued to follow us gradually increasing their numbers arld becoming more bold and noisy untii at length one fellow threw a ntllla nulla at me we still quietly pursued our journey in the hope of tiring them out but observing the same native in the act of throwing a boornerang at me and seeing that all the men mrere armed with two bludgeollsX I considered it time to get rid of them at all hazards I therefore turned my horse and charged them when most of them fled but one lame and evidently troublesome fellow stood and raising his bludgeon as f to throw it dared me to come on I presented a pistol at him and suppose the expression of my countenance told hinl he must go or be shot for he soon turned and fled when in order to frighten them we fired two pistols over their heads It is difficult to explain to the inexperienced how nauch annoy ance a small party must always be subject to from the natives the kindtless and folbearance it is ollr duty to show tovvards such savages create in them a degree of lJoldness and daring not at all times to be cheeked I fear without a severe example Eneamped on the Victoria about 3 miles to the eastvsard of the 3urxetiorl 29nd Removed the camp about 6 miles

their presence known to us in saluting the rear man of the party by throwing a stick at him They made a great noise as if to frighten us but ran away when I turned my horse and charged them On gaining the open ground they still continued to follow lIsS and became very noisy The rear man being in danger I desired follr men to gallop towards them and fire their pistols over their heads This however had not the usual good effect for they kept increasing in number and followed close upon our footsteps favoured by the scrub which in places was very thick Finding at a distance of 6 miles that we could not get rid of them and that we were approaching a scrub through which we should harre to make our way to the place at which we intended to encamp I determined on halting for 2 or 3 hours to refresh the horses We accoIdingly did so and at 4 rM resumed our journey our friends still keeping us company uhich they continued to do till we got clear of the scrub when they deemed it pru dent to desist from their pursuit after having followed us a distance of 11 miles Encamped on a patch of fine grass in the centre of a plain The zodiacal light was most beautifillly apparent this evening till

arrived at our irxner campingground where we found the waterhole dry Bhilst Mr Turner Ws engaged in searching along the channel for water we received a visit from a party of natives consisting of three men and a boy On my asking them for water they at once told me to follow them and they would show me some which they did and that I might perfectly urlderstand that we were at liberty to take some7 the old man of the party led me down to the brink and bid tne drink As a return for his kindness I made him a pre sent of a knife and also gave his companions such things as we could dispeIlse witah I was much pleased with them and they were without exception the most friendly and bestbehaved natives I metwith on the journes They remained with us till sunset when they took leave asking permission to visit us in the morning which was of eourse readily granted I however determined not to remain lest we should inconvenience them and therefore ordered an early start on the morrow Sunday

and the black boy to the spot vvhere we had buried the carts about 5 miles E of our present position which I had the satisfaction of finding undisturbed A native or natives had evidently been sounding in two places that very morning and had left pro bably to obtain assistance Determined therefore to be beforehand with them we left the eamp at sunset etommenced opening the pit at 8 o7clock and by 12

we should renlain there and it was not without some difficulty tixat we obtained ermission to do so I made them a present but finding that they were becorrling troublesome I got rid of them In the evening some of them returned making signs to us to leave upon whicb I ordered them oR To this they paid no attention and I therefore sent three men towards them when they took to their heels Our horses made an end of the water at this camp Iut there is a large hole about i of a mile lligher up which I should think is seldom dry 9th At 6h 30m AM we left our encampment and keeling the right bank or rather plain of the river passed our camp of the 2nd August near which ue observed two natives which convinced me that there was water in the neighboulhootl Moving on along our track of the 2nd August we found water at 13 miles and encamped near the spot at which we crossed the river on that day Although the holes are not deept there are several ot them and as the rainy season may be expected in another month I think it not unrea sonable to suppose that water may in rnost seasons be found along this channel Judging by its appeararlce on this our second visit If I were bound hence down the Victoria I woud keep this channel br 20 miles further and then strike oWdue W to rneet the opposite side of the lend 10th Remained in camp 11th Proceeded along my outuard track to our

camp This days journey was almost entirely over open plains 13th Kept the track until we reached the SE angle of the river shown in Sir T Mitchells map rhen leaving it to our left took an ESE course until we reached the river beyond the bend about half a mile above our former camp s finding water in tuo holes and not wishing to pass our second camp from this betore Saturday on account of some observations I wish to make thell we encamped at 10 AM The plains or downs between this and the reach are covered with fine pasture and being hard sound ground are utell adapted for sheep or cattle At sunset squally weather set in from the west wald accompanied with a heavy thunderstorm and rain but at 10 PM the wind shifted to the SE and the renlainder of the night was fine 14th Continued our journey along the track to within 17 mile of our campirsgground of the 27th July when leaving it on our lett we made the river about 1 mile beyond it and encamped on the east side The water has greatly Mallen since we viere last here  but there is still a little in almost every hole Rain has evidently tallen here lately for the plains are covered with the most luxuriant green grass 1 5th

svatercourse at which it has a shar bend from the northvvard alld being on a sandy riflge similar to those on the Nive I struck of from the track and kept an easterly course through the most open

rook up our o1d position at the junction about noon Found the water falling fast 19th Removed tive camp to the junction of the Nivelle a short stage but bein2 uncertain as to where I might next find water I thought it prudent to halt there and prepare for a forced rnarch the hole was dry but we obtained suffieiellt water by sinking three wells 20th Made an early start and at 11 AM reached our camp of the 20th Julv but finding no water in the creek pushed on to one 7 miles further at whici1 I had bivouaeked twice and had always found abundance of uater On reaching ity however ue fbund the holes periectly dry Having travelled 20 nils we rested our horses for a couple of hours and at 5h 30m PM again rnoved on following the track by moonlight At 10 PM after having tlavelled a distance of at least 30 miles we made our old campin ground near Mount Playfair uhen the horses could scarcely be restrained from rush inU to the hole at which they had formerly watered It now hozrever7 pre sented the appearance of a hole that had not contained uater for rrlonths being perfectly dry and full of deael leaves and we were consequently obliged to keep the horses on tether all night 21st At 5 AM we resumed our journey and reached our camping ground of the 17th and 18th July on the Warrego at 9h 30m Here we bund as I had arlticipated an abtlndant sllpply ot water This hole and that on the Nivelle are the only tuo betveen our present zosition and the reach on the Victoria to be depended upon in a very dry season although I should think this part of the country is very seldom visited by such a drought as prevails at Iresent judging from the healthy appearance of the trees and the luxuriance of the pasture on the Victoria lains 22ncZ Allowing the horses a days rest after their long march I rode this morning in a southwesterly direction to the range laid lown by Sir T Mitchell Oll the W side of the Cuno with the view of ascertaining whether there is a vsatercourse of any importance between it and the Warrego After boring thlouh the very dense scrub which crowns the dividing ridge7 I came upon an open forest country and crossed a number of shallow creeks and flats in whicl the holes were dry Having reached the range and satisfied rnyself that there was no very considerable creek between it and the Warrego I returned to the camp but instead of coming back through the scrub kept it on my right anal rode in a northeasterly direction On this course I observed an olening ill the scrtlb throuth vvhich I obtained a elear passage to the cart tracks ln going from the Warrego to Mollnt Playfair thc thick casuarina scrub might therefore be avoiAed by turning to the left just before entering it The night being cloudy I was prevented from observing the eclipse of Jl1piter7s satellite tOL XXII S258 Ewtracts from the Jourrzal of an exploring 23rd Removed the camp to my depot of the 4th to 16th July wllere we found a plentiful supply of gater as well as at the hole half a mile iower down on thc S side It commenced raining at sunset and continuetl allnost inces santly throughout the night 24th The rain continued till noon mhen it cleared up In the evening there appeared to be a very heavv thunderstorm to the northward of us Conceiving it desirable to ascertain whether the Warrego was a southern water flowint into the hIaranoa or a western onc flowirlg to the Desert I determined ulon tracing its course for 3 days 25th Taking LuS lZouglass and Harry with me I left the camp early this morning to follow the course of the river down  but on my arrival at the wells I found so much rain had allen lately that I resolved to return and take the party with me and rull the chance of its joining the Maranoa At l PM I again left the round waterhole with the party and at 3 PM encamped near the nvells 26th Continued our journey down the BTarrego and at about 5 miles on a southerly course lost sight of the river and found ourselves on the top of a pretty high ridge Finding an easy descellt we bllowed a uatercourse lown inasouthwesterly direction between brigalowridgesuntil at 7 miles we reached Kangaroo reek in lat 23 33 24 Its bed was broad and sandy Iut dry where we made it LuS and Costigan found water about a mile MSNV Ot the camp to which the horses were taken 27th Proceeded on a course a little to the westward of S but finding that me must keep more to the W to make tile river we gradually altered it until we crossed it at about 5 miles frorn last nights camp Cutting o0 an angle on a SSW course we touched upon the river where there was agood uaterhole On the right bank of the river there was a clear elevation from which I took the bearing of a ridge N 77 E and observed the Warrego in the opposite valley At about 18 miles arrived at the junction of Kangaroo reek with the Warrego in latitude about 25 35 Not finding any water I sent the party back to the last hole ue had passed and rode 5 or 6 miles down tile river  it preserves an almost due W course for that distance when it receives a sarldy tributary probably the Nive and takes a southerly course I returned to the camp undecided as to whether I should continue to trace the course of this river or give it up as a westerly water Lat 25 301 6 A single native was seen this evening  he came to his guniah with two or three cockatoos but departed on finding us in possession of the spot 28th Encouraged by the solatherly turn I observed in the river last evening I deterrnined upon tracing it so long as my stock of flour would admit of my doing so Having lett a chisel and other presents in the tent of the native I saw last night as an acknoFledgment for the water we had used we pro ceeded on our journey down the rivern and at noon halted without water Sent a man down its bed in search of some and atter giving the horses a couple of hours rest moved on to water in lat 25 40 36 29th Continued our journey down the river which at first took rather an easterly turn At 9 miles on a general southerly course cncamped at the junction of a creek from the eastward where water may in all seasons be found Lat 25 51 22 Marked this camp XIV At our encampment of last night there is a reedy hole which in a favourable season must contain a fine sheet of water and although the extreme heat of the weather and the heavy nature of the ground would not admit of my making a close search I teel sure that this part ot the river is well matered 30th Travelled down the river on a geIleral SSW course At about 8 miles crossed YoYo Creek and followed it down to its junction with the rivcr under a rigalow ridge on its left bank Eneamped on the vSr side of theExpeditioa ido zeltral AustrQlaa 259 river at the junction in lat 25 57 55 Marked this camp XV We dis turbed a party of five natives in the YoYo Creek who ran away at first but returned after the tents were pitched fIaking Ilarry uith rtle I uent up to them and found them to consist of an old man his ginw and four sons  they u ere a most ortlerly set but at first to everything we said to them they replied Yoyo by which perhaps thev meant to signify their assent to all our interro gations We exchanffled presents and although I was not able to obtain rsuch information from them I found that their language was the same as that of the natives of the desert At sunset we yarted company we returning to our camp and they to their3 on the opposite side of the river 31st Obtained distances of moon and Mars and sun and moon also sights for time Iook Welch and Harry with me to the sllmnlit of a ridCe bearing S 70 W distant fronl the tents 3 miles TSle view was not extencled but Mount Boyl bore E 5 S and a more distant range N 80 E In the even ing our Yoyo fiicnds paid us another visit I showed them the camp and gave thenl some blead and tea but they used both very sparingly I have remarked that all the natives ue have met are scruulous in tasting anything we give them I shovsed them the tree marked li that in case any one should make inquiries they might be able to show it to them as the natives of the Balonne did to me on a similar occasion They all seemed to say that there was plenty of vvater to the southutard but none to the westward Nov 1st Following the easternmost branch ot the river vve continued our jollrney down it At 5 miles the river disided into a number of small chan llels but a mile urther on we founl abundance of urater in the easternmost blanch At 9 miles a brigalow ridge closed in upon the river and at 10 me eneamped the excessive heat of the weather rendering it impossible to travel aftel 12 oclock without great injury to the horses Mie obtained mater irl a rocky hole off the river but about l a mile up the eastern channel there u as a fine reach of water rhe countly travelled over today was open and uould make an excellent cattle station Lat 26 6t 30 S 2nd Contiroued our journey dourn the E bank of the river over opcn flats and a forest eountry At 8 miles came upon an oren acacia forest running along the side of a ridge but the top being too thick to penetrate we ran it down to the river and encamped atter a journey of l0 miles The river is llere divided into several channels but contains a reach of uater at tllc point of the ridge about 500 yarls below ollr camp Ihermometer Fahr 104 in the shade Several thurlderstorms were observable assing to the north ard but no rain reached us 3rd Moved onwards but as the river here seemed to take a mresterly turn and florn thc latitude we were in I expected the reverse I kept a southerly c olll se so as to cut of thc bend At 5 miles got uon table land and travelled through thick acacia scrubs and over small plains whieh appearel to hante been cleared of scrtlb bv fire At about 15 miles savsr plains lnd a scrubby ridge 3earing S 85 E and encamed atter a iourney of 2i miles without water ut with the ill of the ground before us Thunderstoruls were flying about all day 4tA Much against my inclination I felt bound to steer tomards the river and not continue my present collrse in expectation of meeting it and accord illgly I travelled WSVV through thiek scrubs and over sandy ground At 3 miles we were obligel to take the horses out of the carts and the packs of the horses and lead them to water leaving two men in charge of the property In lO mile made the river and about S miles down

Continued our journey down the left bank of the river which here takes a great turn to the eastward at 3 miles crossed a flat on the E side of which I observed the line of pinetrees seen the day before yesterday under the plains At 4 miles met six natives with whom I stopped to speak but could obtain no information from thern hearings me ask about urater they followed me and one of the party acted as guide to a fine reach very similar to those on the Balonne ln returIl for his civility I gave him an old powder horn and bade him and his friends adieu  but they followed us for a mile or two before they finally left us They were as ill looking a set as I have met with and the young man who acted as our guide had in his belt the blade of a knife which Niblett recognized as the property of W Bond and which had been lost at the depot on the WIaranoa After travelling about 10 rniles we encamped at the junction of a deep creek with the river which today has preserved nearly a SSE course the niht being cloudy prevented my ob serving the latitude 6tA1 Continued our journey and endeavoured to keep a southerly course but had great difficulty in doint so in consequence of the scrubby and sott nature ot the ground At 8 miles observed a fall of glound to the SSE anl therefore preselved the same course as ue had been previously keeping although the carthorses u ere nearly knocked up by the extreme heat and soft ground At 10 miles observed smoke in front of us bearing SSE but after going 1Emile further the wretched horses were completely exhausted and wq were obliged to rest for an hour In the meantime I rode on with Harry but not succeedinz in making the river as soon as I had anticipated and the ground being heavy I decided on returning to the carts and conducting them to the nearest point of the river Accordingly keepinffl SSE at sunset we descended a gully and encamped upon a creek contailling water in the neighboulhood of which there was excellent pa3ture for the horses 7th Moved the camp down to the river about 12 nlile VVSW In no part of the colony have I seen more luxuriant pasture than is to be here met with The river contains a fine deep reach tronl 50 to 60 yards across and the lagoons and holes near its bank are full to the brinl lhe grass has the appearance of a wheat crop so thick and high has it grown which coupled with the plaills on either side ot the river render this as fine a site for a station as coulel be desired Lat 26 54 17t S Marked this camp XVI Although two eclipses of Jupiters satellites occurred last night I was unable to observe them in consequence of the cloudy state of the weather and there beinffl no moon I could not determine the longitude of this camp but it is nearly under the sanle meridian as our positlon of last Sunday which uas 146 44 7 E 8th Considering it a pity to lose so fine an opportunity of recruiting the horses which stood much in need of rest I determined on giving them till Thursday 3 days to recruit Takinffl Luff and Harry with me I rode to a ridge about 2 miles distant from the camp in a SSE direction  but the scrub was too dense to admit of a very extended view lo the westward forest lanl appeared to extend as fir as the eye could reach 9tAl laking Welch with me I rode domn the river to the southvward to examine the country Although I did not reach it I am convinced that the river which here takes a tremendous sueep to the westuard returns as much to the eastward a few miles from our camp 10th Sent Lutf and Harry along my tracks of yesterday to the southu ard in search of the river At 4 PM they returned havinz as I had anticipated come upon the river in that direction so we shall be saved a long detotlr 1ltAl Continued our journey down the river keeping a genelal S

atain hal to turn in towards it and Inake it in about 22 miles to the westward rherc are fine reaches in the river at this point from 60 to 70 yards across The night was cloudy I marked this camp XVII

feli a very little fell 5 nliles to the southward the trees were from 30 to 40 yards apart 12th Pursuing the course of the rierer s hich we found to be nearly SSE containing a succession of reaches and having fine grazing land on either side we encaxnped at Camp 18 in lat 27 14 3 S on a fine sheet of vstater neally 2 miles long and 60 yards broad 13th Having ascertained that tlle river took a westerly turn a short dis tance below our camp I this morning decided on a S course svhich vve kept over the most beautiful grassy plaills for nearly 20 nliles at that dis tance I inclined slightly to the eastward and encamped without water at 25 miles having a ridge bearing from V to WSW distant 4 miles on the opposite side of the river It blew a galc from the eastward throllghout the nirht This evening about 5 oclock before I had deviated from my S coul se I reached a flat falling S doubtless into the river and as I had reviously taken the bearing of smoke well to the eastward I novv regret that I did not follow it down My anxiety to find water for the horses after a long days journey induced me to seek the nearest point of the river 14th Continued my journey a little to the uestuard of S and at 4 miles arrived at a pine ridge which lies parallel with the river Running down a box flat in order to asoitI some of the sand we at length crossed the ridge and at 52 miles encamed on a lagoon near the river in lat 27 41 33 Callp 19 limilesVVof18 15th Pulsuing a S course at 1 miles we crossed the flat upon which I had touchedon Saturday evening 13th instant om its appearance I have

for half a mile ute encamed near a small reach of water in lat 2 56 311 Young Harry returned from duckshooting reporting that he had seen a native peeping at the man who had just before fired a shot Upon my asking him vehether he spoke to the native he replied  Bel  that fellow run above u hen him see trle putting in ball belong it gun It appears that he had at the tinle only a charge of duckshot he therefore deemed it prudelst to ram down a ball on the top of it 16th Clearing the serllb along the riverbank me traveled over plains not so well grassed as those of yesterday for 8 miies in a

we could not oltain any information from her or indeed induce her to speak a word we there bre let her depart in peace and continued our course At 7 miles we touched on the river here a parched bed of sand  following it down for some distanec we arrived at a point where its channei most singularly splits illtO two the one running due E the other due W at right angles to the main channel Harry having been down the eastern arm in search of water I despatched Wech and him down the western arm and halted the arty until sunset At 7 PM I moved on slowly SE bv S intending to push on to the Culgoa in case VVTelch shoultt fail in his search At 23F miles vze arrived at the eastern arm runllinffl W to rejoin the other As the men would require a halt for supler before many hours I made one answer the two pur poses At 11 PM Btelch overtook us and reported that he had followed the river for 9 or 10 miles and that where he left it it was reduced to an insignificant sandy bed of no width not presenting the most remote sign of mater They had passed the junction of the channel upon which Be then were but there was no improvement in its appearanee its general direction was W Harrv vTho has a

crossed a shallow cleek falling to the eastward and at 7 AM found the salne creek enlarged inclilling to tlle southward A dense smoke appearing in rny line of march I hoped to arrive at water at no great distance At 8 AM we recrossed the creek near the smoke and found a plentiful supply of water 19tAl Having arrived at 8 AM I gave the horses rest for the remainder of the day In the afternoon several natives came up to the tents tEley utere fine men and appeared disposed to be friendly rhey understool the Victoria language but spoke a different one Upon repeating a feu words of the Victolia they pointed in that direction and appeared well aware froln whence mre must have come we could not obtain the name of this creek nor did they seem to know the names Balonne Culgoa Narrars c

entered a box flat anl open torcst which broken here and there by snlall patches of serub continuel for 17 miles The ground vas that loose crurrbling soil found on the Narlan and which is very distressing to horses At 17 miles we came to a pine ridffle and at about 20 miles not having fallen in with any water I halted Unti1 11 PM RII latitude 28D 59t Traveilin by moonlight we moved on through scrub alternating with pine and brigalow At daybreak we had made only 9 nliles At 6h 3m AM finding the horses especially those in the cart wearied by so long a journey over such a wretched country I decided on having them unharnessed unloaded and taken on to water Rhe party cast lots for the two to be lett behind tlsey fell to Mr Turnel and Doufrlas After every one had had a pot of tea from the keg there remained thee quarts for the two persons left behind At 6h 35m I puslled on vsith tlle horses one of them was not esllected to travel more than a mile as it as with tlitiiculty e

directly in our front with detached smokes in a line with it they all rose from behind a belt of timber about 4 miles distant on the opposite side of thc plain Cnfident they must be in some matercourse Bre crossed the plain full of hope even the poor animals quickened their steps at the sight before them bwlt we mere only hastening zo disappointment alld about to cnter as dreary wretched and worthless a country as imagination llowever excited could conceive It was nou nearly noon the thermometer marked 112 and we ucre crossing herbless ridges of red sand bearing nothing but a few stunted ironhark scrub and patotles of spinifex  these with a brush of poisonwood were in flames all around adding intensity to a hot wind almost intolerable and much against the poor thirsty arsimals that had barely strength to crawl away from the fire as it roarel towardsour flank At 1 PM I left the horses all endeavouring to obtain shelter from a solitary Kllrrajong tree which was scarcely capable of atiordin shade to one and walked to the top of a sandy eminence upon our lett Sweeping round uith my glass the same desolate terrificlooking country presented itself on all sides Returning to the horses I determined to pursue my course S 37 E until me should reach some shade in which the horses could stand till sunset At 2 PM we entered a pine scrub and halted till 7 PM having travelled about 18 miles As the sun was setting we made preparations for proceedin Changing the course to ES E we had to bore through a pine scrub At 3 miles Rattler was reported to be s knocked up and unalJle to move any further  he uras therfafore lett asdelay ould perhaps occasion the loss of many other horses We just then came out upon an extensive plain and for a while I entertained a hope that ure had entered a better country and had seen the last of the scrubs  but alas  hasring reached the timber on the opposite side instead of seeing flooded streams or the sign of a atercoulse brigalow azain aeared Pushing through it at 7 miles q27 from the carts we reached a srnall grassy plain It was then 11 PM and as the horses had eaten nothing for two days we halted until 2 AM At 5 we again nloved foruard tor a short distance through a brigalow scrub but beyond it tElrough a long and close pine forest In the latter Be dropped poor old Jack an excellent cart horse and perhaps the most generally usetul horse I had At 3 nliles filrther l3Oxel our best carthorse and my rivate prorerty was abandoned  but the black horse that appeared not able to stand before we left the carts continued to lead the rest although he took every opportunity of lying down Having cleared the ine scrub in 4 miles our old friend brigalow reappeared At 34 miles it being then daybreak a number of gallard birds flew past us which gave me great hopes that we zrere fast approaching the river At 40 miles and 20 minutes before 8 AM we arrived on the Culgoa in lat 29 2bl 41t S long 146 18 E We had then travelled about 70 miles vsithout vtater and had it not been or the llnllsually heavy ground passed over on the filst datr and night and the sandy nature of the collntr we had to cross in a hot wind as if in front of a furnace the thermomeler standinffl at 110 in the shade we should have brought all the horses through g but these unfortunate circumstanees urere too much for the carthorses after their fatigue in the carts Having allomed the horses to feed till 4 PM I despatche1 Belch my lightest man and Harry the native boy as tracker to take six gallons of water in two kegs 3 in each and tin flasks holding in all another gallon to the two men leftin charge of the carts lSor this purpose he rode the chestnllt colt Harry the black colt and Puneh earried the keffls the only horses then capable ot returning

exploring 23rd I anxiously awaited the return of Niblett and LllS whom I expctel to bring up Jack and lSoxer in the cool ot the morning but about 11 AM they made their appearance without cither Jack they had found dead or so far gone that he could not swallow water poured down his throat but Boxer had moved from where he had been left and they were unable to trace him Having no horses but those I required to convey water to the carts I was tllen unable to make any further search Isook a walk to the eastnvard in the after noon and found a miserable flat parched country with patches of acacia scrllb 24th My instructions to Welch before he started uith tlle water were to make the best of his way to the carts beforc daylight and not to delay on the road  but after having arrived eary in the morning to keep the horses in thc shade until sunset when Douglas and Harry were to return with the empty kegs and tins I requested Mr Turner to stay a day or two longer in chargc of the property    At an early hour I stationed myself in the best position for seeing iurthest down the track most anxiously awaiting the arrival of Douglas Should the three colts pertorm their task I knew that some of the other horses with the additional rest would be able to manage it but shuld they have knocked up on the road how was I to relieve the men 40 miles distant HLad the man marched on foot with water in such meather he uould llimseXlf have required as much urater as he could carry to assist him to the carts The case ras almost desperate and if I had nel er known painful anxiety before I experienced it tAlen Hour after hour passed but no one appeared out ot patience I had my horse up and rode along the track to meet them At length when 4 miles on the road at about 11 AM LuS told me he fanciecl he saw them coming and to my joy I soon found that he was right The poor colts having been allowed to rest too long during the night u ere tottering along trvinr their utmost to reach the water they had started from under a most tsovverfully hot sun Refreshed bv washing out their mouths they got on wonderfully well My mincl mas novvielieved as to the safety of all the men in the party and t received a note from Mr Turner telling me that they had 7 quarts of lAater left when Douglas startedn and that he hoped I would not expect them to mait longer than Friday In consequellce ot the low condition of the horses I deemed it prudent to send no oftener than uas actually necessary I had in my last journey frequent opportunities of being aquainted with that critical time It was my intention to have sent Costigan and Wall the two lightest men but Mr Turner expressed a wish that LuS should be one of the men I determined upon sending them away on Thursday eveninffl to arrive early on Friday morning As natives had not hitherto been seen on the river me diel not imagine that they were near to us but tvero vsere observed about 9 AM stealing down the bed of the river Having no firearms at hand I gave an alarm upon which they made ofF but immediately afterwards a bommerang was thrown at me  it fell about 5 yards short of the mark and was immediately answeled by a shot We heard no more of them 25th Passesl the day in bivouac under the shelter of boughs the thermome ter stood in the shade at 110 At sunset Luff and WSall started with water for the carts takinffl 6 gallons in kegs and 1 in

here detail gave me great uneasiIless 28th In bivouac on the creek At sunset I took Douglas CoCstigan and Harry with 6 horses and 10 gallons of water II the bedE and started br the carts The night became excessively dark and ue were compelled to halt 2 hours in the scrub but at 5 AM we arrived at the flat half way to the carts The heat caused tlS to travel slowly A close night and a hot wind increasin tllat of the day 1 was so fatiguecl I could haraly reah m destillation eEpef1ition into Central Austrczlia 265 arrived at the carts at 9 PM and after an hours sleep commenced arranging loads for the return About sunset we started homewards and had the good fortune to enjoy a drizzling rain for the first tew hours At break of day uc reached the flat and gave the horses a drink and an hours feed then movel on and arrived in carnp at 2 h 20 m AM ot Tuesday the 30th Dec 1st Took observations for longitude which I made 146 18 2nd Playing at patience in bivouac until the horses regain their strength 3rd Taking Niblett with me I stal ted on a due north course for 20 milf s with the view of ascertaining the direction of a tributary to our river For that distance we were never out ot scrub either brigalow or pine generally the former Having reached the latitude of the carts I turned tomards the river which I reached the following morning 8 miles to the eastward in lat 29 11 4th Convinced that I collll not improve upon my first track I returned to camp keeping nearer to the river of which the general course is about SW by S We reached the tents at 8 PM 5tA1 In the afternoon the bed was again filled uith water and at 1 PM Luff Costigan and Welch started with the horses for the carts  all accom panied them to bring back the bed from the halfLway flat where they were to water the horses Harry also went with them I wished them to reach the flats about 8h 30m PM and by Harrys guidance to he at the carts before daybreak7 at which time they were to return so as to meet Douglas who had 14 gallons of water at the flat about 104 AM They were to reach the pine scrub in the cool of the evening and then to find a fresh supply of water so as to be at the camp in the eariy morning 6th Wall reached the camp at Sh 54m AM the bed was filled and Douglas started uith it at 7h 10m AM 7th Douglas who oufflht to have been back at 10 oclock last everling had not made his appearance at daybreak It vvas l lW before he came Harry having lost the track for the first time on Monday night 6th they had been compelled to halt 15 miles short of their destination In consequence of this they were obliged to start at midday and had to toil over the plain and sand ridges in heat sufficient to kill the stoutest and strongest horses Owing to this they lost 12 hours and the bed had to be refilled and sent up to meet them 8th Douglas returned at 1 AM and reported that the horses had bee brought forward but that the carts hafl been left 5 or 6 miles behind Boco one of the leaders was unable to come on until he had had a dish of water 9tA1 Taking about 20 gallons of water I left the camp at 5h 40m AM with Niblett to meet the carts and see the state of the horses Boco had been left 2 miles bellind I determined to allow the horses a few days rest at the river before they attempted the pine scrub and sand ridges I sent Niblett with 6 gallons for Boco and returned to camp desiring that the horses should be allowed their own time I wished to observe the eelipse of Jupiters 1st and 4th satellites but Mr Turner who had the first watch called nle at lh 10m AM instead of 11h 45m PM The mean of my observations on the satellites and the calculation by lunars gave my long 146 6 22 It was 12 miles W of the truth All the cart horses except Boco and aptain came in in the afternoon and Luffremairled svith the latter 7 miles off till the evening 10th I despatched Mr Turner and Wall with the bed containing about 21 buckets of water for Captain and Boco Niblett and Wall returned at 2 rM telling me they founal Boco insensible and that he died in tne night he seems to have broken his neck by falling uhilst attempting to rise rom the ground Captain they said woulul be able to come in if he had a further sllpply of water uhih I sent by Welch but the poor animal died in spite oi it of atigue and exposure to the sun These accilents w ere in solne degree266 Etraefs from the Jour nal of al exvlo itg owing to Harrys losing his may and the proceellings of the 27th of Nov I had intended to drive the carts in myselt but was too exhausted to travel on foot and my presence was needed to superintend the filling of the bed 11th This bein ration morning anal having 12 lbs of flour left I gave halt of it to Douglas telling him to make it last the week I then served out powder and shot to the sportsmen and sent them out to procure a meal We had a small piece of bread for breaktast but tor dinner a quart of soup a pigeon each and enough bread to lay by a portion

7h 5m ieft the camp in charge of three men takixlg the rest and all the horses for the purpose of bringing home the carts At 7t miles on a grass flat I left the bed slung to a tree in a tarpaulin and at halfpast 7 AM reached the carts By the time we had made up packs and loads tor the horses and arranged the earts the day broke Welch Harry and I rode 3 miles beyond the carts7 to see whether a tracl spoken of as running off from ours was one made by the last horses We found tmo tracks made by Walls horses when returning to camp at night he having lost his way As soon as it was light the carts moved on and betore I could overtake them with the packhorses they were through the muchdreaded pinescrub the horses drawine steadily although five of the six mere acknowledged  gibes At a

station on the ltarwan whieh is the lowest occupied run on that river Not beints able to procure a sufficient supply of flour to enable me to proceed up the Bogan in which river I am told there is now abundance of water I rode on 12 miles to Mr Druitts station taking Niblett with me and two pack horses There I learned also that flour was scarce  and the next station be longing to Mr Henry Cox of Mudgee Mulgoa  utas 5 miles higher on the opposite side of the river 23rd Rode to Mr Coxs statioIl which is in charge of Etlwarl Bosfield who said he had extra rations of flour tea and salt and accordingly sold me 150 lbs of flour at 251 per ton 6 lbs ot tea at 4s per lb  30 Ibs of salt at 30s for 100 lbs I paid by an order on the Bank of Australasia havilog ascertained that the rations belonged to the men Returned to camp in the erenin 24th In camp all day fising my stations on the map I found this morning my leg much inflamed from the bite of some insect on Tuesday last 21st inst Five or six of my men were therefore despatehed in search of leeches ly Bhich the inflammation mas reduced 2Sth Left Lawsones station and returned to XXiVII  whence I in end to cross over to the Bogan There was a thunder3torm with a few drops of rain in the evening This makes the third Christmas I have srent on expe ditions one on the Bogan last year on the Namoi this on the Barwan 26th Shortly after sunrise it was discovered that Harrv had departed with his blanket and blue shirt but leaving his striped trowsers at the camp as too heavy for him I at once susected he had been decoyed by a native of the Barwan we had seen at Lawsons The weather vas intensely hot but as I had taken charge ot the lad trom his mother although only a gn I considered it my duty to bring him back if possible and prevent his meetinz the fate of twro young natives of the Nammoi who within the last sis months ran from Mr Ray on this river and were killed at a lagoon 1 mile from IJawrsonQ by the irreconcilable savages of the Bargan Immediately after prayers I there fore rode with Costigan to Lavesorls te tracked the tluarlt the sshole uas7L7xpeditton into Cerzral Australia 269 anl uere amllsed bv observing how he had hesitated to rass the grave of a M hite man who had been killed by the natives about 3 miles from our camp Not finding him at the station I despatched two gins to traek him which they did most cleverly in places where I could not have discovered the slightest mark They traced him to the river where we met some cannibals returning with bark they said they had not seen him but had seen his track going to the next station This was false or they had spoken to him I waited till the storekeeper who was away came home he instantly put the gins upon the track again and they succeeded in tracing him past Lawsons on the road to Druitts I arrived at the latter station at dusk alld found my friend Harry seated underthe verandah He was much frightened at seeing me I told him I was not angry at his being desirous of seeing his friends but at the act of the fellom who had induced him to follow a road on which he would surely have been killed i and that my only object in going after him was to enable me to return hirn in saity to the station whence I had taken him  and at the same time I romised to forward him to the Nammoi the first leavourable opportunity as I found his desire to reach home exceeded his wish to see Sydney He had walked 24 miles after leaving the camp and was passing Druitts station when a gin saw him and tried to persuade him to go to the hut but not succeeding she told the hutkeeper who brought him in and gave him dinner It svas a bold undertaking to seek to reach the Nammoi a distance of 130 miles without visiting the stations and with the certainty of passing throllgh the notoriously cruel tribes of the Barwan rhe boy is naturally brave and ot a high and haughty spirit accompanied as is usually the case with a kind and affectionate disposition He has often said of his mother  I blieve that fellow been boey a quiet way of expressing his fear that his mother might be dead and whenever the men mention his mothers name he turns the subject or looks as black as thunder knowing how little respect such mell have for gins He has picked up so much EntFlish on the journey that he can make himself understood whatever he wishes to say and in addition to this he has acqllirel an activity and obedience that would be no discredit to a white boy older than himself His appearance has greatly improved no longer a poor child he has become a tall wellset lad vaith a kind but bold expression of countenance 27th Wishing to cross the Barwan today I had the horses tethered but owing to some accident one being tethered on a slope was found dead mitl his head downwards I returned to tile camp late unable to move 28tA Crossed the Barwan and on a SSE course reached the Bogan in 3 hours the bed was so shallovf that I doubted whether it mas that river I encamped in latitude 30 4 24tt S 29th Travelled along the left bank of the supposed Bogan S 40 E and in one hour found myself in the track of Sir Thomas Mitchells drays His marked line is so plain that we found the track although made 13 years ago and travelled along it up to our camp in latitude 30 14 13h There was a breeze during the early part of the day but the heat in the afternoon was intense 30t1lv Took up Sir Thomass track and travelled the same stage he did to latitude 30 17 29t Saw the first native a gin on the river near the track 31st Kept sir Thomass marked

SustraZia NOTES TO THE FOREG9ING ITABLES From the 17th to 26th of June are the observations of Mr Turner If there are errors in these readings as at S 2 vnd with S wind there are IlO means of cor recting them Yet on comparing these readings with my own Journal kept at St Leonards I find that on 20th June there was there a hot wind and thunder storm with the lowest barometrical state since 1st Jan A violent squall ocourred at St Leonards at  at Port Stephens at 2 PM and 300 miles to E there was at sea a heavy gale at 7 PM The barometers here fell gradually from 14th June Two barometers in my house indicated a mean of 18 observations that dayy 29y313 and 29118 or 29164 and 29029 corrected At Port Stephens Captain King RN at X recorded 29 492 and in 34 S 156 3U E the haro meter in the Garland Grove showed 2944 The observations from 5th to 16th of July incIus2ve were made by Mr Turner From lSth to 25th July inclusived all along the E coast of N S W we had most furious gales from NW and W with great depression of the barometer trees vere blown doxvn and ships wrecked As indicating the conne2iion of Kennedys warm winl with our gales the following barometrical means of 18 observations on 22nd July corrected will suffice viz 29 010 and 28814 It was thet result olf a circular gale from SF to SW of St Ieonards passing to NE left to right The mean of two barometers 22nd  18 observations was 28 w 9122  23rd 13 observations was 28  902 the elevation of this locality is 300 feet above the sea The extracts from my oWI1 JourIlaI are made to point out how closely the weather in the interior corresponds with that on the coast There are other very remarkable coincidences not mentioned I can ollly regret that there are no means of comparing barometrical readings Mr K has given some instances of boilirly temperature On his return I examined his thermometersthey appeared to me altogether unsllited for such experiments One of the instruments the indications of which are recorded in the MS I rejected having found it varied several degrees from the one which gave the resuIts in this table Mr K after my examination of them admitted the boiling temperatures to ljave little value The excessive cold at sunrise on various occasions is quite in accordance witls the observations of Sir T L Mitchell in the same part of the interior in a former year On the 4th and Sth of July Mr Kensledy noticed a temperature of 9 5 and 8 75 Fahr Sir T L Mitchell had sunrise temperatures of 11 and 12 in May and June 1846 and states in his despatches that  on almost every clear nights Fahrenheits thermometer fell to 9 and occasionally at 4 AM the melcury was as 1X3w as 7 Occasionally a temperature of 15 and on one occasion of 6 has been registered in Julle in the county of CamdenWv B C

AUSTINFRIARS DEC 7TH 1757 S I R T H E FOLLOWING CASE BEING VERY SIN GULAR HAS INDUCED ME TO LAY IT BEFORE THE ROYAL SOCIETY AND BEG THE FAVOUR TO DO IT THROUGH YOUR MEANS ALTHOUGH NUMEROUS INSTAN CES ARE RELATED IN THE RECORDS OF MEDICINE OF THE GREAT DANGER IN INTERRUPTING NATURE IN HER OPERATIONS THERE IS NOT ONE SO FAR AS I KNOW IN WHICH MORE VIOLENT AND EXTRAORDINARY EFFECTS HAVE BEEN PRODUCED THAN IN THE FOLLOWING READ DEC 8 1757 IT MAY HAPPEN ALSO THAT THIS INSTANCE MAY BE OF SERVICE IN ASCERTAINING THE VIRTUE OF THE MEDICINE IN INTERMITTENTS WHEN IN THE HANDS OF MEN OF JUDG MENT ON THE 28TH OF JUNE 1757 MARY ALEXANDER AGED 31 YEARS OF THE PARISH OF WHITECHAPEL WAS BROUGHT INTO THE LONDON HOSPITAL HAVING A MORTIFICATION IN BOTH HANDS WHICH REACHED ABOUT AN INCH AND HALF ABOVE THE WRISTS ALL HER TOES AND ABOUT AN INCH OF ONE FOOT BEYOND THE LAST JOINT WERE MORTIFIED HER NOSE WAS ALSO INTIRELY DESTROYED BY A MORTIFICATION AND ALL THESE HAPPENED AT THE SAME TIME UPON IN QUIRY INTO THE CAUSE OF THIS MISFORTUNE I FOUND THAT ON MONDAY THE 30TH OF MAY SHE WAS SEIZED WITH A QUOTIDIAN C C C 2380 QUOTIDIAN AGUE WHICH USUALLY BEGAN ABOUT THREE OF THE CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON AND LASTED NEAR TWO HOURS WHICH WAS SUCCEEDED BY A HOT FIT AND THEN A VIOLENT SWEAT AND IN THIS MANNER SHE WAS AFFLICTED FOR SEVEN DAYS WITHOUT ANY MATERIAL ALTERATION WHEN BEING INFORMED BY A NEIGHBOUR OF A PERSON WHO HAD AN INFALLIBLE REMEDY FOR THE CURE OF AN AGUE SHE APPLIED TO HIM HE BROUGHT HER TWO PHIALS CONTAINING ABOUT AN OUNCE AND HALF EACH OF A PALE YELLOWISH LIQUOR ONE OF WHICH HE DIRECTED HER TO TAKE DIRECTLY PRO MISING THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE NO RETURN OF THE FIT OF CONSEQUENCE AND THAT IF SHE HAD ANY SMALL RETURN THE SECOND BOTTLE SHOULD CURE HER EFFECTUALLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH SHE TOOK ONE DOSE WHICH WAS AT THE TIME THE COLD FIT HAD BEEN ON ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR SHE HAD NO SOONER SWALLOWED IT BUT AS SHE SAYS HER STOMACH WAS ON FIRE AND FELT AS IF SHE HAD SWALLOWED THE STRONGEST DRAM POSSIBLE THE COLD FIT LEFT HER INSTANTLY BUT SHE WAS IMMEDIATELY SEIZED WITH SO VIOLENT A FEVER AS TO MAKE HER BURN AND BE EXTREMELY THIRSTY ALL THE FOLLOWING NIGHT MUCH MORE SO THAN EVER SHE HAD BEEN BEFORE TILL THE NEXT MORNING WHEN A SWEAT A LITTLE RELIEVED HER FROM THE VIOLENT HEAT WHEN SHE ROSE IN THE MORNING SHE WAS MUCH TROUBLED WITH A GREAT ITCHING IN THE HANDS FEET AND NOSE AND SOON AFTER ALL THOSE PARTS BEGAN TO FEEL NUMBED OR AS SHE DESCRIBES IT AS IF HER HANDS AND FEET WERE ASLEEP WHICH SHE TOOK BUT LITTLE NOTICE OF TILL THE EVENING OF THAT DAY WHEN SHE FOUND THE NAILS OF BOTH HANDS AND FEET WERE TURNING BLACK AND AT THE SAME TIME FEELING GREAT PAIN IN BOTH AS ALSO IN HER NOSE AND THAT THEY APPEARED OF A DARKISH RED COLOUR LIKE THE SKIN IN COLD WEATHER UPON381 UPON WHICH AT NINE OCLOCK THAT NIGHT SHE SENT FOR AN APOTHECARY FROM WHOM I HAVE SINCE BEEN INFOR MED THE PERSON BEFORE MENTIONED HAD BOUGHT THE MEDICINE WHICH HE GAVE HER THE APOTHECARY WAS NOT AT HOME HIS JOURNEYMAN WENT AND FINDING THE WOMAN HAD A DIFFICULTY OF BREATHING ORDERED HER A MIX TURE WITH SPERMA CETI AND AMMONIACUM TO BE TAKEN OCCASIONALLY THE APOTHECARY DID NOT SEE HER HIMSELF TILL THE 16TH OF JUNE WHEN FINDING HER IN A VERY BAD CONDITION THAT HER HANDS AND FEET AND NOSE WERE INTIRELY BLACK AND HAD MANY VESICLES OR SMALL BLADDERS UPON THEM FILLED WITH A BLACKISH BLOODY WATER HE OPENED THEM AND LET OUT THE FLUID AND DRESSED THEM WITH YELLOW BASILICON AND IN THIS MANNER CONTINUED TREATING HER TILL THE 20TH OF THE SAME MONTH WHEN FINDING NO MATERIAL ALTERATION FOR THE BETTER HE OR DERED HER A BROWNISH MIXTURE OF WHICH SHE WAS TO TAKE FOUR SPOONFULS EVERY FOUR HOURS WHICH HE IN FORMED ME WAS A DECOCTION OF THE BARK AND SAYS ON TAKING THIS SHE WAS BETTER AS THE MORTIFICATION SEEMED INCLINED TO STOP BUT AS IT WAS A BAD CASE HE ADVISED THE WOMAN TO BE CARRIED TO AN HOSPITAL AND IN THIS CONDITION WAS SHE BROUGHT IN WHEN SHE WAS IMMEDIATELY PUT INTO A COURSE OF THE BARK TAKING A DRACHM OF THE POWDER EVERY FOUR HOURS AND IN 48 HOURS TAKING IT THERE WAS A PERFECT SEPARATION OF ALL THE MORTIFIED PARTS SHE WAS THEN ORDERED TO TAKE IT ONLY THREE TIMES IN 24 HOURS AND PURSUING THIS ME THOD FOR EIGHT DAYS THERE WAS A VERY GOOD DIGESTION FROM THE PARTS ABOVE THE MORTIFICATION THE MORTIFIED PART BECAME NOW SO OFFENFIVE THAT THE POOR WOMAN PRESSED ME MUCH TO TAKE OFF HER HANDS ASSURING ME SHE WOULD GO THROUGH THE OPERA TIONS382 TIONS WITH GOOD COURAGE BEING VERY DESIROUS TO LIVE THOUGH IN THIS MISERABLE CONDITION ON THE 12TH OF JULY I TOOK OFF BOTH HER HANDS I HAD VERY LITTLE MORE TO DO THAN SAW THE BONES NA TURE HAVING STOPPED THE BLEEDING WHEN SHE STOPPED THE MORTIFICATION IN A DAY OR TWO AFTER I TOOK OFF ALL THE TOES FROM BOTH FEET AND NOW DISCON TINUED THE BARK THE PARTS APPEARING IN A HEALTHY AND HEALING CONDITION WHICH WENT ON SO FOR FIVE WEEKS WHEN ON A SUDDEN THE PARTS BEGAN TO LOOK LIVID HER STOMACH FAILED HER AND SHE WAS FEVERISH BUT UPON TAKING AN OUNCE OF THE BARK IN 36 HOURS HER SORES BEGAN AGAIN TO LOOK WELL SHE WAS NOT SUFFERED TO LEAVE OFF THE BARK SO SOON THIS TIME BUT CONTINUED TAKING IT TWICE A DAY FOR A MONTH SHE IS NOW ALMOST WELL THAT PART OF HER FACE FROM WHENCE THE NOSE MORTIFIED WAS HEALED IN SEVEN WEEKS THE STUMPS OF BOTH ARMS ARE INTIRELY HEALED AND BOTH FEET ARE WELL ONLY WAITING FOR ONE PIECE OF BONE SCALING OFF WHICH I BELIEVE WILL BE IN A VERY SHORT TIME AND SHE IS NOW IN GOOD HEALTH THE PERSON WHO GAVE  THIS MEDICINE IS A BAR BER AND PERUKEMAKER AT BOW I APPLIED TO HIM SEVERAL TIMES TO INFORM ME WHAT IT WAS HE HAD GIVEN HER THE AFFAIR WAS TALKED OF SO MUCH IN HIS NEIGH BOURHOOD AND THE MAN THREATNED BY THE WOMANS HUSBAND THAT FOR A LONG TIME I COULD NOT GET HIM TO TELL ME TILL I TOLD HIM I HAD BEEN INFORMED WHERE HE BOUGHT THE MEDICINES AND THE TIME OF THE DAYTHAT HE HAD THEM CORRESPONDING WITH THE TIME OF HIS GIV ING THEM TO THE WOMAN AND THAT I KNEW IT WAS TINC TURE OF MYRRH HE AT LAST TOLD ME THAT HE HAD FRE QUENTLY GIVEN THE ABOVE QUANTITY OF AN OUNCE AND HALF OF383 OF IT IN AN AGUE THAT IT HAD NEVER DONE ANY HARM AND HARDLY EVER FAILED TO CURE UPON WHICH INFOR MATION I CARRIED SOME TINCTURE OF MYRRH TO THE WO MAN WHO TASTED IT AND IS WELL ASSURED IT IS THE SAME LIQUOR THE BARBER GAVE HER IN HER AGUEFIT I AM WITH RESPECT YOUR OBLIGED AND OBEDIENT SERVANT

j101009,The Virginia Law Register,1102895,Scope of Statute Abolishing Survivorship between Tenants by Entireties,i245994,NOTES OF CASES land v Vincent 10 Metc Mass 371 43 Am Dec 442 Garner v Town of East Point 67 S E 847 This is a headnote opinion by Supreme Court of Georgia Scope of Statute Abolishing Survivorship between Tenants by En tiretiesIt was decided by the Supreme Court of West Virginia in Irvin v Stover 67 S E 1119 that  18 ch 71 of their Code abol ishing the commonlaw right of survivorship between tenants by en tireties did not apply to a life estate by entireties but that survivor ship as to such an estate remains at common law In other words that provision of their Code applies only to estates of inheritance But it is unlikely that this decision would be followed in Virginia because  2430 of the Code of 1904 in abolishing survivorship uses the terms any estate and this would certainly indicate an inten tion on the part of the legislature to include estates of every kind whatsoever especially as this was passed as an amendment to a similar section in the Code of 1850 which applied in terms only to estates of inheritance Registration of Automobiles as Affecting Recovery for Injuries to PassengersIn Feeley v City of Melrose 91 Northeastern Reporter 306 the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts held that where an automobile was not registered as required by law there could be no recovery for injuries to the passengers or for damages to the au tomobile caused by running into an open trench in a highway al though the passengers did not know that it was not registered It appeared that the automobile had been registered but that there had been a transfer of its ownership before the accident thereby causing the registration to expire a statute providing that upon the transfer of ownership of any automobile its registration expired As no new registration was made the court held that the automobile was unlaw fully upon the highway and that the passengers were not travelers but trespassers It is unlikely that the decision in this case will be very gener ally followed It seems misleading in the extreme to state that no duty is owing to the innocent occupants of an auto in such a case as this where injuries were reasonably to have been anticipated by a failure to properly maintain the highway in proper repair The rule in this jurisdiction is well settled that the violation of a statute or municipal ordinance is merely evidence of negligence and is not in any sense prima facie evidence thereof But even in those jurisdictions in which it is held that such violation is negligence per se a causal connecton between the act and the injuries must still be established Platt etc Canal Co v Dowell 17 Colo 376 Penn sylvania R Co v Hensil 70 Ind 569 Thus it has been said that a person violating a public ordinance is a wrongdoer and negligent ex necessitate in the eye of the law but 1910 227

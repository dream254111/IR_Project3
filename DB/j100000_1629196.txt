CORRESPONDENCE VON IHERINGS ARCHIPLATAARCHELEMIS THEORY IN SCIENCE for December 7th Dr H von Ihering gives a condensed statement of his views on the origin of the South American fauna This is the more welcome since the original publications of v Ihering although dating back to 1890 are not very well known chiefly because these articles of which v Iher ing gives a list have been published in period icals in which hardly anybody would look for them Part of them are of a mere popular character while another part are too much out of the way and they do not by their titles give any indication that we might look in them for a discussion of zoogeographical topics of general interest As regards the chief idea of v Ihering that South America consists genetically of two different parts Archiplata and Archamazonas which have become united subsequently I am of the opinion that this theory is well worth discussion Indeed I have accepted this theory in my studies of the distribution of the fresh water Decapods and have been able to collect further material in support of it And further in the report on the Tertiary Invertebrates of Patagonia collected by the Princeton Expedi tion which is in course of preparation I shall again refer to this theory as a very acceptable one for the explanation of certain features in the distribution of marine animals There fore I was much surprised to see that v Iher ing refers to my studies on the freshwater crabs and crayfishes as at variance with his theory for only in this sense I can interpret his reference to my biologic barrier My theory of a  bioccenotic barrier  formed by the Patamonidse tropical freshwater crabs for the Potamobiidae and Parastacidae crayfishes re stricted to the extratropical parts of either hemisphere was formulated to explain only the Bipolarity of the latter groups without any reference to the special conditions in South America but chiefly in respect to those prevail ing in the old world I shall discuss this question againt and shall pay particular at tention to the South American conditions with reference to v Iherings theory I think that the South American Parastacidse are members of the old Archiplatan fauna and are connected genetically with the New Zealandian and Aus tralian Parastacide and have reached these parts apparently by way of a land connection across the Antarctic regions while the South American Potamocarcininse subfamily of Pota monidse are characteristic of the old Archama zonian fauna and point possibly to a former connection of the latter with Africa v Iher ings Archhelenis In this connection I must add that v Iherings argument given in the article referred to as to the coexistence of Potamocarcininse and Parastacidae in southern Brazil is probably a mistake there are to my knowledge no Potamocarcininse in southern Brazil but the freshwater crabs of small size to which he probably alludes are Trichodacty lins the genetic relations of which are doubt ful They have nothing at all to do with my biocoenotic barrier and certainly do not  an nul it In favor of the theory of a former disconnec tion of the northern and southern parts of South America I may call attention to other consider ations A communication of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans in Tertiary times is generally accepted and this connection is chiefly placed at Panama Now according to Hill  the Isthmus of Panama was land since Mesozoic times with only an unimportant interruption at the end of the Eocene but Hill himself admits that there must have been a connection of oceans somewhere in the Tertiary The theory of v Ihering gives us a clue to this If we move the interoceanic connection from Panama southward and construct it where there must have been the sea separating Arch amazonas and Archiplata that is to say across  See Bipolaritaet in Zool Jahrb Abt f Syst v 9 1896 p 593 t Decapoden in Bronns Klassen und Ordnungen vol 5 Abteil 2 p 1289 This part has not yet been issued and I am quoting

between both oceans within the tropics Just this kind of connection is demanded by the facts that have led to the assumption of an interruption of the isthmus of Panama The former connection of v Iherings Archi plata with a supposed Antarctic continent is no new theory but goes back in this form as far as Riitimeyer 1867 and I have no doubt that we should accept it But we hardly can accept it in the shape of Forbes  Antarctica 1893 This huge continental mass is simply impossible and Professor Osborn SCIENCE April 13 1900 has very properly tried to re strict it to a reasonable size but I think we should still more contract its boundaries In this respect I should follow Hedleys t views who practically but without giving a map accepts the limits of the present Antarctic continent as defined by Enderby Wilkes Victoria and Graham Land with only such extensions as are absolutely necessary to con nect it with the present southern continents A E ORTMANN PRINCETON UNIVERSITY Dec 7 1900 THE LONGEST AERIAL VOYAGE TO THEE EDITOR OF SCIENCE The official re port just received of the longdistance balloon race from Paris on October 9th changes some what the figures on page 799 of SCIENCE which were those furnished to the press It appears now that Count de La Vaulx and a companion traveled 1200 miles in 35 hours and 45 minutes in the basket of a balloon con taining only 57000 cubic feet of illuminating gas They reached a maximum height of three and a half miles crossed Germany and landed in Russia as did another of the con testants This is probably the longest con tinuous voyage in the air ever made although it was nearly equaled forty years ago by our  An historical account of the different theories ad vanced for the explanation of the relations of the southern faunas and a classification of them will shortly be published in the American Naturalist t Proc Roy Soc N S Wales 1895 August 7th countryman John Wise who with two com panions went by balloon in 19 hours from St Louis to Jefferson County New York a dis tance of 1150 miles It is evident that under the management of an aSronaut a balloon can be kept longer in the air than an unmanned balloon but never theless a balloon of 8700 cubic feet capacity carrying only selfrecording instruments which was liberated from Berlin in 1894 after attain ing a height of ten miles was carried 700 miles to the borders of Bosnia at a speed of 62 miles an hour Still more remarkable in its way was the flight of a pair of kites last summer from the Royal Aeronautical Observa tory near Berlin Five kites which had lifted selfrecording meteorological instruments to a height of two and a half miles broke the wire that confined them to the ground and the two upper kites dragged it across the country for nearly a hundred miles before they were finally checked the trailing wire two miles in length furnishing sufficient resistance to keep the kites flying throughout the night A LAWRENCE ROTCH BLUE HILL METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATORY November 30 1900 THE CRIMINAL HIS PERSONNEL AND ENVIRON MENT To THE EDITOR OF SCIENCE Disclaiming in any sense to answer the attack upon my re cently published book The Criminal his Per sonnel and Environment emanating from the pen of Mr Havelock Ellis and published in your valued journal of the 19th inst I never theless deem it but justice to myself to ask of my critic a verification of the assertion therein made that When he the author mentions authorities he is unable in a large proportion of cases even to spell their names  the italics and parentheses are my own Now as I happen to cite a very large number of names and while fully conscious of my liability to err the charge is an exceedingly broad if not hazardous one which if failing to sub stantiate will lay my critic open to a grave countercharge I respectfully challenge Mr Ellis to make good his proofs which if true may readily be done In the event of his ina 930 SCIENCE

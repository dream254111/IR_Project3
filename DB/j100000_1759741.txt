India through Europe to North America If their dis tribution was by the northern approaches of the con tinent it must have been in preglacial times because as Dawkins shows an icebarrier must have spanned the great oceans in northern latitudes It seems an almost fruitless speculation to inquire into the manner of their dispersion yet one is tempted to surmise that if they originated in the tropics then submerged continents must again be restored to offer the necessary means for such a dispersal If on the other hand their home was in the north or south temperate zone and the distribution circumpolar and this seems more probable then we have another evidence of the wide separation which the race had acquired at that early day from its tropical relatives the apes Whatever the facts mlay ultimately show this unparalleled distribution of a people in the lowest stages of savagery proves beyond question that mau must have preexisted for an immense period of time for with the known fixity of low savage tribes the time required to disperse this people over the whole earth can only be measured by geological centuries The farther we penetrate into the past and ascer tain some definite horizon of mans occurrence other observers in widely different regions of the earth bring to light traces of mans existence in equally low horizons The evidence of the remoteness of mans existence in time and space is so vast that to borrow an astronomical term no parallax has thus far been established by which we can even faintly approximate the distance of the horizon in which he first appeared From this fact we are justified in the assumption that the progenitors of quaternary man under different genera possibly must be sought for in the tertiaries Science will not gain by the erection of any theo retical barriers against tertiary man until such defi nite forums are met with that shall reasonably settle the beds in which he first occurred We know in what rocks it would be obviously absurd to look for his remains or the remains of any mammal So long however as forms are found in the lowest beds of the tertiaries having the remotest affinity to his order we must not cease our scrutiny in scanning unbiased even the rocks of this horizon for traces of that creature who until within a few short years was re garded as some six thousand years old and who in despite of protest and prejudice has asserted his claim to an antiquity so great and a dispersion so profound that thus far no tendency to a convergence of his earliest traces has been demonstrated SCIEN TIFIC MlE THODS

economic sci ence and statistics of the American association for the advance ment of science at Philadelphia Sept 4 by Gen JOHN EATON U S commissioner of education WVashington vicepresident of the section NCE VOL IV No 84 disseminate scientific knowledge in comnmon life Science has had a hard struggle with ignorance A host neither small nor amiable has been arrayed against it What wonder then that it has first intrenched itself where the use of instruments of precision and the demonstrations of mathematics separated it from the critical issues of mans every day conduct Nevertheless history may in the re mote future express surprise that in Amlerica where the power and conduct of man are so important science has so long neglected the rugged issues as signed to this section There is now no good reason why scientific men should neglect to apply scientific methods to the economy and statistics of everyday life If mnathe matical principles and processes are applicable to the statics anld dynlamics of physics why not also to the statics and dynamics of society If useful in econo lics why not in personal and domestic life True in all questions of conduct we must include mans free action of will and leave rooln for doubt or for alternatives or for contrary choice yet how many questions of daily life are left to the merest conjec ture to superstition or to the wild estimaginings and how large a percentage of blunders might be avoided We smile that a pagan commander moved his army by the flight of a crow or by the aspect of an animals entrails but how many merchants sail their ships and agriculturists plant or harvest by the guesses of charlatan weatherprophets or how many actions are determined by seeing the moon over the right shoulder or by confidence in a horseshoe M yriads of groundless notions today affect the conduct of personal and public affairs It is time for science to enter Many a juggler would then lose his business many a prejudice have to be given up Pockets policies and politics are involved in the issue The disposition to revel in the marvellous to dally with uncertainties and to tieat all mystery as concealing the superhuman would be disturbed The phrases we guess we reckon are giving way to the phrases we will inquire we will try to know Sir William Thompson has said Accurate and minute measumiemelnt seems to the nonscientific imagination as a less lofty and dignified work than looking for something new but he adds  Nearly all the grandest discoveries of science have been but the rewards of measurement and patient longcontinued labor in the minute shifting of numerical results Thus the methods of economic science are the same as those of other branches of science while the latter also yield statistical results It is unfortunate that scientific men aspire so exclusively to original researchl We need men to couple love of science with love of mankind Liv ingstone desired to explore Africa for science but as much so for the civilization of benighted Africans Is science for nlan or man for science  Is not bene fit to mankilnd the real measure of the good that is in science Doubtless Stephenson was more perplexed with the mood of the parliamentary committee than with the questions of improving his steamengine From aSEPTEMBER 12 1884 SCI member of that committee came the absurd question Would it not be a bad fix if the engine should meet a cow on the track Yes said Stephenson it might be bad for the coo The dissemination of truth is as scientific as its discovery Sometimes scientific men act as if truth could not be expressed in the vernacular  indeed as if it cannot be truth un less dressed in their terminology College men used to feel that their triennial would lose character if deprived of the dignity of Latinthough it was often bad Latin All this foolishness is fast passing away Already it is an honor to scientifically teach science as well as to advance its domain Still it is rarely met with and far less understood than sciel tific research Here is a great field for immediate occupancy The scientific method of communicating truth recognizes the fact that in early life mans powers are shaped and too often the bulk of his knowledge acquired Hence its fundamental rule must be sim plicity in the use of language and in the presenta tion of each truth in the concrete This scientific method is needed even to preserve classic learning from disgrace and disuse Adopted in the whole domain of scholastic instruction it would bring new votaries to science and new benefactors even to the support of pure science A better taste for all kinds of literature would result Low writing would be at a discount We should thus cheapen scientific litera ture and increase museums for objectteaching We may never destroy the taste for low and degrading prints by inveighing against them and thus advertis ing them but we may create a taste for valuable reading which will not be satisfied by the vile This literature cannot be the same for all persons but the scientific method should pervade it all Morals would not be excluded but enforced the imagina tion not neglected but purified and elevated The body of information could not exclude any truth of service to mankind Every great subject would bring its contribution shaped to scientific methods and adapted to all minds the earth as influenced by the sun and the starry world its surface of land and water of mountains and streams and valleys of barren and productive soil the plant life that dwells upon it the animal life it supports the circum ambient atmosphere and its phenomena and man the scientific animal who makes all this ado and for whom it is made and to whom it is given to possess The Adam of this period of scientific thought might call up his several sciences and direct each to yield what it possesses for this correlation of economic thought for human instruction guidance enjoyment and betterment for this evolution of science forthe greatest good of man by doing its utmost for the common things of daily life Gravitation weighs alike the most volatile particle and the vastest of far off stars The laws of economic science are the same to the lowly as to the great man by them he meas ures the price of his salt and the safeguards of his liberty Towards this gatheringup for mans daily use of all the lessons of nature the progress of the race is SNCE 247 tending Steam the telegraph and the telephone focus all thought and action We shall yet demand of every department of knowledge What good for man Each science will have its body by itself and yet fill numerous relations to every art and yield its practical lessons to every man according to his understanding and preparation Data thus correlated will meet the childnay will guide the paternal in fluence and action in its behalf But now the child in its greatest dependency is met with the destruc tive follies of ignorance Neglect mistakes or down right violations of natures laws often consign him to the grave or plant in him the seeds of permanent disorder Physicians may relieve his colic or cure his disease but how rarely can they so direct the nursing and training as to assure health If the im pairment is mental and we go to insaneasylulns for advice we learn what per cent of the cases under treatment could have been prevented and efforts will be made to cure But we want prevention not cure We want information upon questions of food of raiment of shelter of air of vocation of occupa tion not for one man or one class of men but for all men in all conditions The era of this diffusion of knowledge has already actually commenced Men not engaged in scientific pursuits are gradually coming to feel the necessity of gathering grouping and generalizing the data which give them a clearer measure of health comfort pleasure as well as the profit and loss involved As balancesheets are studied in business so are ques tions of finance of taxation and public expenditure Great operations like those in corn in coal in cot ton in wool or silk leather or lumber in iron or gold or silver and of all the great industries  agri cultural mechanical commercial professional demand and have their collections of statistics and their vast accumulations ready as contributions to economic science But the correlation of all these and their actual results have not yet been reached Nevertheless money sees the profits of this wisdom and is more willing to pay for it Expert investiga tors are in demand Public action requires it The idea of a republic in which all its citizens shall act patriotically and virtuously from free choice of the right course and on their own knowledge demands it Napoleon I said Statistics mean the keeping of an exact account of a nations affairs and without such an account there is no safety while Goethe declared I do not know whether figures govern the world but this I do know they show how it is governed America has accepted the responsibility of reporting its operations and of disseminating information for the benefit of all the people Boards of health of charity of education and bureaus of statistics and labor are demanded by state and nation They are becoming potent in reducing to order the chaos of data so long without form and void The character of the information demanded mlarks the progress of the age During how many ages was the counting of men and the measure of their con dition undertaken solely to prepare for war Even our own colonial census was taken for this purpose248 SCIE The constitution of our fathers provided for rep resentation in congress and in the electoral college according to population This has led to vast re sults A magnificent world of data is now spread before us by the census Every man woman and child and their interests enter into it and it has its lesson for each in all their various capacities and relations but not more than a hundred thousand can possess it and few can master the whole of it It would be too much to come annually and there fore cannot be frequent enough to meet every con dition Many statements should be annual Our system of government affords an excellent opportu nity to perfect a system of statistics parallel to the decennial census and fitted to meet all demands Publicists have said much of the importance of the townmeeting as found in New England An important characteristic of it is the bringing of all questions of public taxation and expenditure and policy to the consideration of all the citizens This attention of all the citizens to the details of muni cipal action in large cities is impossible therefore there are public reports and manifold statements But should the town system of reports be every where adopted and these be followed by county and state summaries the nation could group these so as N CU VOL IV No 84 to give a variety of form and result sufficient for each according to his interest The student and statesman would find them falling into appropriate classes of sufficient frequency and in connection with eur decennial census of the nation would discover us in the very front rank with respect to knowledge of ourselves as a people This is now done mleasurably for the subject of education Each institution publishes its report or catalogue most towns and cities their reports many states gather up the data and the national bureau carefully avoiding improper complications and solely for the purposes of information issues an annual volume The result is unique in the history of voluntary statistics Were this system carried into every other great field and the whole distilled into a single vol ume and should eacli nation do the same we should see the beginning of a solid foundation for inter nationalism and the scientific method at last per vading the world of thought It would determine the most farreaching generalizations and have an effect upon common life not now possible Child hood would be ushered into new conditions and alike the humblest and the highest would more easily find the truth BRITISH ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIEVNCE PROCEEDINGS OF THE rMA THEMA TICAL AND PHYSICAL SCIENCE SECTION THE session of the British association in Montreal might be fairly designated as a section A meet ing in view of the leading position in British science occupied by the representatives of that section and the prominence which was accorded them and their section in the general meetings of the association The retiring president of the association who was to have been present but was not was a distinguished member of the section His few duties were grace fully performed by another distinguished member of the section Sir William Thomson who also presided over the sittings of the section during the meeting As representing the retiring president he introduced his successor the president for 1884 in the person of Lord Rayleigh another of the strong men of sec tion A Two of the three evening lectures were given by members of the section on subjects co1n nected with physics and astronomy When it is remarked that the place of meeting offers no especial attractions to students of mathe matical and physical science it will be admitted that the roll of the section presented an unusual array of great names including as it did such as Sir William Thomson Lord Rayleigh J C Adams J W L Glaisher Henrici Dewar Preece James Glaisher Lodge Rev S J Perry Osborne Reynolds and many others As might be easily inferred from a glance at the above list a large majority of the papers presented had to do with physics rather than with astronomy or pure mathematics By a judicious action of the sectional committee and one worthy of imitation the papers were very fairly bunched  by subjects so that one was not required to remain during the entire week in order to listen to the treatment of a particular topic The first notable physical paper to be presented was of course the address of Lord Rayleigh as president of the association This address has already been placed before the readers of this journal and no extended reference to it will be necessary Although historical in the main it was rich in valuable and timely suggestions such as could come only from one as thoroughly familiar with the topics referred to as its author As a sample of these may be quoted the remarks con cerning the theory of the action of the telephone which was declared to be still in some respects ob scure as is shown by the comparative failure of the many attempts to improve it and in considering some of the explanations that have been offered Lord Rayleigh said We do well to remember that molecular changes in solid masses are inaudible in themselves and can only be manifested to our ears by the generation of a toandfro motion of the external surface extending over a considerable area If the surface of a solid remains undisturbed our ears can tell us nothing of what goes on in tile interior  T Is vr 1 T I

employee operating a boring mill which alleges that the employee was assigned to the work by the foreman with direction to hasten it that he went to work on a dark and foggy morning that the elec tric lights by which the shop was usually lighted were not burning that the light over the boring mill was out of repair that the ab sence of light made it necessary for the employee to use a hand torch provided by the employer for emergencies that he held the torch in one hand while operating the mill with the other and that while operating the mill it became necessary to lean over to observe the progress of the work and that in holding the torch over the machine to obtain light his hand was drawn into the mill but which does not allege improper construction of the mill or that the de fect in the electric light had existed for a time sufficient to have af forded the employer an opportunity to inspect and remedy it in the exercise of reasonable care states no cause of action as against a de murrer for if the torchlight as used furnished enough light the ab sence of the electric light was not the sole and proximate cause of the injury and did not contribute thereto in any degree Ed

j100128,Columbia Law Review,1110921,Termination of Easements,i246295,The denial to the mortgagormember under the facts of the princi pal case of the right to credit any of the premium in satisfaction of his loan would nevertheless be so fraught with hardship as to excuse if not to justify the illogical decisions attempting to escape this result But it is submitted that it is not necessary to be thus illogical When a court of equity in order to bring about the swift winding up of an insolvent building and loan association permits a receiver to foreclose it aids him to c6llect from the mortgagormember if he is not in default1 an obligation not yet due under the agreement in favor of an association which has failed to fulfil its contractl Surely there can be no doubt that in determining the equities of the parties the court should take into consideration the damages inflicted on the shareholder by the associations inability to perform and by the failure of the purpose with which he became a member Evidently if this is so it only remains to determine the measure of his damages which it would seem should properly be the difference between the actual market value of money at the time and the amount which he actually paid Accordingly the decision in the principal case although perhaps not based on the strictest logic by charging the borrower with legal interest and crediting him with premium and interest paid approximated the correct result2 TERMINATION OF EASEMENTSThe right to exercise an easement which is an incorporeal hereditament and an interest in land within the Statute of Frauds arises by grant express or implied or by pre scription It is ordinarily terminated by a release either actual or presumed from some user made of the servient tenement by its owner adverse to the enjoyment of the easement and it may be brought to an end by the destruction of the particular property to which the easement is appurtenant or by the happening of the contingency on which the cessation is made by the grantor to depend Thus the grant of an easement of flowage for a specified mill comes to an end on the destruction of the mill and an easement of necessity ceases with the circumstances giving rise to it Again it is well settled that an easement is extinguished by the union of the dominant and servient estates in the same person since in the nature of things one cannot have a right against his own land2 though where the estates in each are not coextensive in seisin the easement is not terminated but 1While in the principal case it appeared that the defendant had not maintained his payment of instalments the court treated him as if not in default If the advanced member is in default credit is only given on the supposition that his interest at least equals in value the amount he has contributed See Hale v Gullick Igoo I3 S D 637 U S Assns Assignee v Rowland 19oI 109 Ky 737 743 In such a case if the association is insolvent

merely suspended during the joinder8 So much is settled ground but in considering the effect of nonuser abandonment and estoppel the courts have not always reached consistent and logical results It has been said that where the easement arises by prescription it may be lost by mere nonuser though not where it arises by grant4 a distinction5 which probably arose from a desire to protect purchasers of the record title and which is clearly unsound on principle since in the case of prescriptive easements a grant is presumed and a title thus obtained should be as effective as though it arose in express grant In any case however the bare fact of disuse by the owner of the dominant tenement cannot raise a presumption of title against him since the legal seisin of an incorporeal hereditament is in him who has the title until actual ouster8 Indeed the only inference that can be drawn is that the dominant tenant had no occasion to use his right In other jurisdictions the courts rejecting the doctrine of termina tion by nonuser but agreeing on the proposition that easements may be lost by abandonment differ as to what shall be sufficient therefor7 Thus an intent to relinquish plus cesser of user has been deemed suffi cient to constitute an actual abandonment without communication of such intention to the servient tenant8 and irrespective of any par ticular period of disuse9 A perfected title to real estate however cannot be abandoned0 in view of the Statute of Frauds and the conclusion seems inevitable that an easement which is equally an interest in land should not be capable of being divested in this mannerl2 The doubt that an easement can be abandoned is well indicated in the statement frequently met with that to deprive the dominant tenant of the easement there must be an act on the part of the servient tenant done in reliance on a representation of abandon ment13 This theory while obscured by the term abandonment in reality amounts to nothing more than this that a license implied in fact permitting the servient tenant to do something on his land incon sistent with the further enjoyment of the easement by the dominant tenant will after its execution estop the licensor from complaining of Thus the joinder in one person of a life estate in one tenement and absolute title in the other merely suspends the easement Thomas v Thomas I835 2 Crompt M  R 34 See

a license to do some thing on the land of the licensor14 or licensee15 which tends to create an easement in favor of the tenement of the latter is revocable even after it has been acted upon it would seem that a license to interfere with an easement should be no less revocable But whether or not the licensor is estopped from asserting his right in the latter case it is difficult to see how the estoppel could be extended to a purchaser of the record title whether with or without notice since a license is personal merely and does not run with the land1s It would therefore seem that while an easement may be suspended by license it is not thus terminated and on transfer of the land or it is submitted on destruc tion of the particular improvement the right should again become enforceable for the contrary doctrine leads to the untenable position that under the fiction of an estoppel the release of an interest in land is effected by parol in contravention of the Statute of Fraudsl7 The diffculty often found by the courts in applying the doctrine of abandon ment is illustrated in the recent case of Blenis v Utica Knitting Co 1911 130 N Y Supp 740 The defendant with the knowledge of the plaintiff having built upon land over which the latter had a right of way it was decided that since there was not sufficient proof of an intention to abandon and since the defendant had not been led by the plaintiff to treat the servient estate as free from the servitude the erection constituted a nuisance While the correct result seems to have been reached the statement by the courtl8 that Such easement cannot be lost by mere nonuser for any length of time but it may be extinguished by abandonment and nonuser for a period of twenty years under circumstances showing an intention to surrender the easement would indicate a failure to grasp clearly the principles upon which it is submitted the conclusion should have been based CONTRACTS OF FOREIGN CORPORATIONS MADE BEFORE

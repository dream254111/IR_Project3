18 1766 MY LORD W H E N I SHEWED YOU THE DRAWING OF AN UNCOMMON LARGE HERNIA AT ROSE YOU WERE PLEASED TO SAY YOU SHOULD BE GLAD TO HAVE THE HISTORY OF IT AND OF WHAT OCCURRED IN EXA MINING THE BODY AFTER DEATH IN ORDER TO COMMUNICATE IT TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY FROM THAT TIME I DETERMINED TO DRAW OUT THE CASE BUT HAVE BEEN PREVENTED BY VARIOUS OTHER ENGAGEMENTS TILL NOW THAT I TAKE THE LIBERTY TO PRESENT IT TO YOUR LORDSHIP AND SHALL BE EXTREAMLY REJOICED IF IT PROVE AGREEABLE TO YOU AND THE LEARNED BODY WITH IT I INCLOSE AN OUTLINE OF THE DRAW ING TAB VII FIG 1 AND AN EXPLANATION WHICH MAY MAKE THE DESCRIPTION MORE INTELLIGIBLE I WASSORRY THAT FOR WANT OF A PROPER DRAFTSMAN MY GOOD FRIEND THE CAPTAIN BEING OUT OF TOWN I COULD NOT HAVE THE SITUATION OF THE STOMACH WITH THE OTHER PARTS LEFT IN THE ABDOMEN TAKEN BUT MY PAINTER WAS SO SQUEAM ISH IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY WE GOT THE OUTWARD AP PEARANCE TAKEN FROM THE DEAD BODY READ MAY 14 1766 WE134 WE HAVE HAD THE DRIEST SEASON HERE I HAVE KNOWN THRO THE WHOLE OF LAST YEAR ONLY 19705 INCHES OF RAIN FELL AND IN THE THREE LAST MONTHS OF THIS ONLY 1689 INCHES INCLUDING WHAT MELTED FROM THE GREAT FALL OF SNOW ON THE 11TH AND 12TH OF FEBRUARY INTO MY RECEIVER THE SNOW LAY THEN 9 INCHES PERPENDICULAR UPON A LEVEL BED IN MY GARDEN I AM WITH GREAT RESPECT MY LORD YOUR LORDSHIPS MUCH OBLIGED AND MOST OBEDIENT SERVANT GEORGE CARLISLE JOHN HALLOWDAY AN OUTPENSIONER OF CHELSEA AGED NEAR 80 HAVING ENTERED VERY YOUNG INTO THE ARMY AND UNDERGONE SEVERAL HARDSHIPS IN THE CAM PAIGNS UNDER THE DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH UPON HIS RETURN TO ENGLAND FROM FLANDERS AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE WAR FIRST PERCEIVED A SMALL TUMOR IN THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCROTUM AND GROIN THIS HE CAREFULLY CONCEALED TO AVOID THE SCOFFS OF HIS COMPANIONS AND LEAST IT MIGHT BE THE OCCASION OF HIS DISCHARGE WHICH HE DREADED AND WANTED TO AVOID AS HE FOUND NO OTHER INCONVE NIENCE FROM IT BUT WHAT ITS BULK OCCASIONED NOR EVER HAD PAIN VOMITING OBSTRUCTIONS TO STOOLS OR ANY OTHER SYMPTOMS OF A STRANGULATED HERNIA FROM THAT TIME HOWEVER IT CONTINUED TO INCREASE IN BULK AND FROM THAT AND ITS WEIGHT GREW DAILY MORE INCONVENIENT TO HIM INSOMUCH THAT ABOUT THE YEAR 1725 BEING 2 UNABLE135 UNABLE TO GO THROUGH THE DUTY OF A SOLDIER HE WAS ADMITTED TO THE OUTPENSION OF CHELSEA HOSPITAL ITS SIZE WAS THEN SUCH THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO HAVE A PARTICU LAR BAG MADE IN THE FOREPART OF HIS BREECHES TO ENABLE HIM TO CARRY ABOUT ITS WEIGHT AND ALWAYS WORE A LEATHERN APRON TO CONCEAL ITS FIGURE FOR SIX OR SEVEN YEARS BEFORE HIS DEATH THE WEIGHT AND BULK OF THE HERNIA HAD MADE SUCH AN ALTERATION IN THE OUTWARD APPEARANCE OF THE PARTS ABOUT THE SCROTUM THAT THE PENIS WAS ENTIRELY BURIED IN THE TUMOR A SMALL OVAL OPENING ONLY WAS LEFT OUT OF WHICH THE URINE WAS DIS CHARGED THIS OPENING WAS SOMETIMES EXCORIATED FROM THE ACRIMONY OF THE URINE AS THE PENIS COULD NOT BE EXTRACTED TO THROW IT OFF NOR THE GLANS BE MADE TO AP PEAR BY ANY ENDEAVOURS AFTER DEATH IT COULD BE PROTRUDED NO FARTHER OUTWARDS THAN AS IT IS SHEWN IN FIG 2 A YEAR OR TWO BEFORE HIS DEATH AFTER A COLD AND FRETTING THE PART BY TOO MUCH WALKING THE URINE HAD BROUGHT ON A CONSIDERABLE INFLAMMATION WHICH MORTIFIED TO A LARGE EXTENT ONE CONSIDERABLE ESCHAR FORMED UPON THE ANTERIOR AND MOST DEPENDING PART OF THE BAG ONE LESS ON THE RIGHT SIDE WHERE IT TOUCHED THE THIGH AND A THIRD BEHIND YET ALL CAST OFF AND HEALED KINDLY BY THE HELP OF THE BARK WARM DRESSINGS C EXCEPT FROM THIS ACCIDENT IN THE LATTER YEARS OF HIS LIFE HE WAS NOT SUBJECT TO ANY OTHER COM PLAINTS THAN ARE COMMON AT HIS YEARS SUCH AS DIMNESS OF SIGHT CATARRHOUS COUGHS SHORTNESS OF BREATH UPON MOTION SWELLINGS OF HIS LEGS OCCASIONALLY AND HE WORE OFF AT LAST BY A GENTLE DECAY HAVING ALL ALONG HAD AS GOOD AN APPETITE AND DIGESTION AS COULD BE EXPECTED AT HIS TIME OF LIFE REGULAR DISCHARGES BOTH BY STOOL AND URINE VERY RARELY VOMITINGS EXCEPT FROM OVER LOADING136 LOADING HIS STOMACH PURGATIVES AND EVERY OTHER MEDICINE OPERATED AS REGULARLY UPON HIM AS UPON ANY OTHER PERSON HE WAS A WELLMADE MAN RATHER ABOVE THE MIDDLE SIZE WAS AS CORPULENT AND HAD AS MUCH STRENGTH AS MOST OF HIS YEARS UNTIL WITHIN A VERY LITTLE TIME OF HIS DEATH HIS CASE HAVING NOTHING PARTICULAR IN IT BUT AS FAR AS THE CONTENTS OF THE ABDOMEN AND SCROTUM WERE CONCERNED IT WAS NOT THOUGHT NECESSARY TO CARRY THE EXAMINATION OF HIS BODY FARTHER THAN THROUGH THEM THE LARGE HERNIAL BAG I HAD MEASURED AS EXACTLY AS I COULD ABOUT A YEAR BEFORE HIS DEATH AND FOUND ITS LENGTH FROM THE OS PUBIS TO THE MOST DEPENDING POINT 15 INCHES ITS GREATEST BREADTH WHILE IT LAY SUPPORTED BY THE THIGHS 17 12 INCHES AND ITS GREATEST CIRCUMFE RENCE 34 INCHES BUT IN THE BODY THE DAY AFTER DEATH ITS LENGTH FROM THE PUBIS TO THE MOST DEPENDING PART WAS ONLY 13 INCHES ITS BREADTH TO THE PART WHERE IT FELL IN BETWEEN THE THIGHS 12 INCHES ITS CIRCUMFE RENCE ROUND THE THICK OR SMALLEST PART WHERE IT DE SCENDED FROM THE PUBIS 19 INCHES AND ROUND ITS LARGE CIRCUMFERENCE 27 INCHES IT WAS COVERED WITH THE COMMON INTEGUMENTS OF THE SCROTUM BUT AT ITS LOWER AND POSTERIOR PARTS THE CELLULAR MEMBRANE OR DARTOS WAS REDUCED TO AN ALMOST CARTILAGINOUS HARD NESS WHERE THE WEIGHT BOTH IN SITTING STANDING AND LYING HAD THE GREATEST EFFECT THE CICATRICES ALSO WHERE GANGRENOUS SLOUGHS HAD BEEN CAST OFF WERE OF AN EQUAL FIRMNESS AND HARDNESS UNDER THE KNIFE THE TESTICLE OF THE LEFT SIDE WAS PLAINLY TO BE FELT AT THE PROMINENT PART ABOVE AND TO ONE SIDE OF THE OPENING FOR THE PENIS NOT FAR FROM ITS NATURAL SITUATION THE RIGHT TESTICLE WAS OBSCURELY TO BE FELT A LITTLE ABOVE THE LOWEST137 LOWEST AND ANTERIOR POINT OF THE BAG BESIDES WHAT APPEARED UPON THE FRONT VIEW OF THE BAG A LARGE PORTION OF IT LIKE A RIDGE EXTENDED BACKWARDS WHERE THE SPACE BETWIXT THE THIGHS ALLOWED IT MORE ROOM THEY BEING RATHER MORE CONCAVE THAN USUAL INWARDLY TOWARDS EACH OTHER AND MORE DISTANT FROM THE CONSTANT PRESSURE THEY SUSTAINED THE COLOUR OF THE BAG WAS THE SAME AS THAT OF THE OTHER PARTS EXCEPT WHERE THE MORTIFIED SLOUGHS HAD BEEN CAST OFF WHERE IT WAS OF A SHINING WHITE UPON OPENING THE ABDOMEN THE LIVER APPEARED RATHER LARGE AND FARTHER EXTENDED OVER THE LEFT SIDE THAN USUAL THE GALL BLADDER WAS SMALL WITH A LITTLE DILUTED BILE IN IT NONE OF THE INTESTINES APPEARED BUT A PORTION OF THE COLON TOWARDS THE ANTERIOR EDGE OF THE PELVIS ON THE LEFT SIDE WHERE IT MADE TWO INFLECTIONS MUCH IN THE WAY AS THE LOWEST TURNS OF THE INTESTINES ARE SHEWN TO DO BELOW THE OMENTUM IN EUSTACH T A B IX FROM THESE IT WENT DOWNWARDS AND BACKWARDS INTO THE PELVIS TO MAKE ITS LAST CURVE AND BE CONTINUED INTO THE RECTUM WHICH WITH THAT LAST CURVE OF THE COLON WAS IN ITS NATURAL PLACE AND DIRECTION THE STOMACH INSTEAD OF AN HORIZONTAL HAD A LONGITUDINAL POSITION ITS LARGE AND HERE UPPER EXTREMITY BEING PLACED BE HIND THE LEFT LOBE OF THE LIVER CLOSE TO THE DIAPHRAGM AND ITS LARGE CONVEX SIDE LAY ALONG THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ABDOMEN IT DESCENDED TO NIGH THE CREST OF THE OS ILIUM FROM WHENCE IT TURNED OVER THE INFLECTION OF THE COLON BEFOREMENTIONED ACROSS THE PELVIS TO THE LARGE HERNIAL APERTURE IN THE RIGHT SIDE WITHIN THE VERGE OF WHICH IT RAN DOWNWARDS ABOUT AN INCH THEN ASCENDED AND MADE A SEMICIRCULAR TURN TO THE PYLORUS WHICH MOUNTED TOWARDS THE ABDOMEN FROM V O L LVI T THENCE138 THENCE THE BEGINNING OF THE DUODENUM MADE ANOTHER TURN TO DESCEND INTO THE HERNIAL BAG IMMEDIATELY BELOW WHICH VIZ JUST WITHIN THE OPENING OF THE HERNIAL BAG THE DUCTUS COMMUNIS CHOLEDOCHUS ENTERED IT AND SEEMED THE CAUSE WHICH KEPT IT FROM FALLING FURTHER INTO THE SAC FROM THIS THE REMAINDER OF THE DUODENUM AND ALL THE OTHER INTERSTINES WERE ENTIRELY CONTAINED IN THE HERNIAL BAG TO  THE EXTREMITY OF THE COLON BEFOREMENTIONED THE DUODENUM AFTER ENTERING THE SAC FIRST RAN A LITTLE DOWNWARDS AND BACKWARDS THEN HORIZONTALLY AND LASTLY UPWARDS TO WITHIN THE EDGE OF THE SAC TOWARDS THE ABDOMEN FROM THENCE THE TEGUMEN PROCEEDED BACKWARDS AND DOWNWARDS AND THEN FORMED WITH THE ILEUM PRETTY NIGH THEIR USUAL CONVOLUTIONS ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE TUMOR AS THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE IN THE ABDOMEN THE CAECUM HAD A VERY SMALL APPENDIX BUT WAS ITSELF VERY LARGE AS WAS THE COLON THROUGH ITS WHOLE LENGTH WHILE CONTAINED IN THE SAC THAT PART OF IT WHICH RETURNED INTO THE PELVIS AGAIN BEING MUCH SMALLER EVEN ONLY OF THE DIMENSIONS OF THE SMALLER INTESTINES THE LENGTH OF THE COLON TOO SEEMED MORE THAN USUAL THE CAECUM BEGAN IN THE LOWER PART OF THE BAG AND FROM THENCE THE COLON KEPT PRETTY NIGH THE COURSE IT SHOULD HAVE KEPT IF THE BAG HAD BEEN THE ABDOMEN FOR A GREAT PART OF ITS LENGTH RUNNING UP FROM THE CAECUM ALONG THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BAG TO NIGH THE PUBIS AND THEN CROSSING OVER TOWARDS THE LEFT SIDE BEFORE THE DUODENUM TO THE LEFT EDGE OF THE HERNIAL APERTURE AT WHICH PLACE SLIPPING BEHIND THE LOWER EXTREMITY OF THE STOMACH IT APPEARED IN THE PELVIS CROSSING OVER TO ITS LEFT SIDE FROM THENCE TO FOLLOW THE COURSE BEFORE DESCRIBED THE PANCREAS LAY IN A LONGITU139 LONGITUDINAL DIRECTION ALONG THE CONCAVE ARCH OF THE STOMACH THROUGH ITS WHOLE COURSE AND WAS PLACED BEFORE THE BODIES OF THE VERTEBRAE THE DUCTUS CHOLEDO CHUS BESIDES ITS GREAT LENGTH FROM THE LIVER TO WITHIN THE HERNIAL BAG WAS OF SUCH A WIDTH AS EASILY TO ADMIT A MIDDLESIZED FINGER BEING ABOUT 212 INCHES IN CIRCUMFERENCE IN SOME PARTS OF ITS COURSE IT WAS LITTLE INFERIOR IN WIDTH TO THE GALL BLADDER IN THIS SAME SUBJECT THE KIDNEYS WERE RATHER SMALL IN GENERAL SOUND EXCEPT THAT SOME FEW HYDATIDES WERE HERE AND THERE FIXED UPON THEIR OUTWARD SURFACE AND THAT TWO OR THREE STEATOMATOUS TUMORS OF ABOUT THE SIZE OF A PEA AND WHITE WERE IN THE SUBSTANCE OF EACH BUT NOT RISING ABOVE THEIR SURFACE THEY WERE EACH IN THEIR PROPER SITUATION THE LEFT LAY BEHIND THE STOMACH AND WAS LESS PROBABLY FROM THE PRESSURE IT WAS EXPOSED TO THE URETERS AND BLADDER WERE IN THEIR USUAL SITUATION THE BLADDER WAS NO WAY ENGAGED IN THE HERNIA AND A CATHETER WAS PRETTY EASILY INTRODUCED THROUGH THE CONCEALED PENIS INTO IT THE SPLEEN WAS SMALL IN ITS NATURAL SITUATION AND SOUND THE ME SENTERIC GLANDS WERE NUMEROUS LARGE HARDENED AND SURROUNDED WITH A FAT OF A DEEP YELLOW AS WAS THE PANCREAS NO OMENTUM APPEARED ITS PLACE SEEMED SUPPLIED BY THE FAT INTERSPERSED AMONG THE GLANDS AND PANCREAS THE TESTES WERE OF A NATURAL SIZE BUT LOOSE AND FLABBY AND HAD MANY VARICOSE VEINS UPON THEIR SURFACE THE RIGHT WHICH WAS SO MUCH OUT OF ITS PROPER PLACE WAS THE LEAST AND LAXER OF THE TWO THE SPERMATIC VESSELS BELONGING TO IT WERE LARGE THROUGH THE GREAT LENGTH THEY RAN THE SAC AND INTESTINES WERE ADHERENT ALMOST AT EVERY POINT OF THEIR CONTACT IN SOME PLACES SO FIRMLY THAT THEY WERE WITH GREAT T 2 DIFFICULTY140 DIFFICULTY SEPARATED AND OFTEN NOT WITHOUT DANGER OF TEARING THE INTESTINES ALSO ADHERED IN THE SAME MAN NER TO ONE ANOTHER ALL BY MEANS OF A FIRM CELLULAR MEMBRANE THE CONTAINING BAG WAS VERY FIRM THICK AND STRONG AS OBSERVED BEFORE ITS APERTURE AT THE RIGHT RING FROM THE ABDOMEN WAS SO WIDE AS READILY TO ALLOW A MIDDLESIZED HAND TO PASS THROUGH IT FROM THE ABDOMEN FOR A SMALL SPACE BETWIXT ITS ANTERIOR EDGE AND THE CONVOLUTIONS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY OF THE STOMACH AND THE SEMICIRCULAR TURN IT MADE TO THE PYLORUS WITH THE BEGINNING OF THE DUODENUM FROM THENCE AND THE OTHER EXTREMITY OF THE DUODE NUM BEFORE THE JEJUNUM COMMENCED AND THAT PART OF THE COLON WHICH RETURNED INTO THE PELVIS ALL OF WHICH WERE LODGED IN THE VERY APERTURE SO THAT THE SPACE LEFT UNOCCUPIED BY THESE PARTS COULD NOT BE MUCH LESS THAN 8 INCHES IN CIRCUMFERENCE NOTWITH STANDING WHICH VERY LITTLE OF A WATERY FLUID WAS FOUND IN THE SAC INDEED IT WOULD NOT HAVE HAD A VERY EASY ADMITTANCE FROM THE MANY ADHESIONS FORMED BETWIXT THE SAC AND ITS CONTAINED PARTS A LITTLE BELOW THE OPENING FROM THE ABDOMEN THE ABOVE IS A TEDIOUS PERHAPS BUT A CIRCUM STANTIAL AND JUST REPRESENTATION  THIS EXTRAORDINARY CASE WHICH I SHALL NOT AT PRESENT LENGTHEN BY DE DUCTIONS OR REASONINGS FARTHER THAN TO ADMIRE THE EXQUISITE COMPOSITION OF THAT MOST ADMIRABLY FORMED MACHINE WHICH COULD BEAR SO GREAT AN ALTERATION IN ITS PARTS WITHOUT A MANIFEST IMPEDIMENT TO ITS MOST MATERIAL ACTIONS SEEING HERE LIFE AND EVEN HEALTH WENT HAPPILY ON THROUGH A GREAT LENGTH OF YEARS THOUGH THE WHOLE SYSTEM ALMOST OF THE INTESTINES HAD BEEN FOR MANY OF THESE YEARS WITHOUT THE REACH OF THE ACTION141 ACTION OF THE DIAPHRAGM AND ABDOMINAL MUSCLES AND OF THE FOTUS OF THEIR GENERALLY NEIGHBOURING PARTS REQUISITES AS HAS BEEN IMAGINED TOWARDS THE CARRYING ON THEIR SEVERAL FUNCTIONS FOR THE BENEFIT OF

J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1076440,EDITORIAL NOTES,I244626,EDITORIAL NOTES THE AIMS SCOPE AND METHODS OF A UNIVERSITY COURSE IN PUBLIC SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION WAS THE TOPIC DISCUSSED LAST MARCH AT THE ANNUAL THE DISU N MEETING OF THE NATIONAL SOCIETY OF COLLEGE TEACHERS OF THE DISCUSSION OF THE STUDY OF EDUCATION AT INDIANAPOLIS THE PAPERS HAD BEEN PRINTED SCHOOL ADMINISTRAAS USUAL IN ADVANCE OF THE MEETING AND HAD BEEN DIS TION AT THE TRIBUTED TO THE MEMBERS OF THE SOCIETY THE PAPERS ESPE MEETING OF COLLEGE TEACHERS CIALLY THE PRINCIPAL PAPER BY SUPERINTENDENT SPAULDING OF OF EDUCATION NEWTON MASS HAD BEEN WRITTEN WITH UNUSUAL CARE AND ARE LIKELY TO HAVE A PERMANENT AND FAVORABLE INFLUENCE ON THE WORK OF UNI VERSITY DEPARTMENTS OF EDUCATION IN TRAINING SUPERVISORY OFFICERSAN IMPOR TANT PHASE OF THE WORK NOT YET WELL DEVELOPED AND GREATLY IN NEED OF DEVELOPMENT IT WAS ACCORDINGLY EXPECTED THAT THE PAPERS WOULD CALL FORTH THOUGHTFUL AND VIGOROUS DISCUSSION OF THE VIEWS EXPRESSED BY THE WRITERS AND THE PROCEDURE RECOMMENDED BY THEM SOME POINTED QUESTIONS WERE INDEED ASKED AND MUCH DISCUSSION ENSUED UNFORTUNATELY HOWEVER TOO MUCH TIME WAS CONSUMED IN A FRUITLESS CRITICISM OF THE ALLEGED PESSIMISM OF SUPERINTENDENT SPAULDINGS PAPER AND THE VAGUENESS AND EMPTINESS OF HIS IDEAL OF UNIVERSAL EDUCATION AS THE FUNDAMENTAL END TO BE ACHIEVED THROUGH GOOD ADMINISTRATION THIS LAST TOGETHER WITH DR SPAULDINGS INSIS TENCE ON VISION INSIGHT AND WILL AS THE FUNDAMENTAL QUALITIES TO BE DE VELOPED IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER BEING CHARACTERIZED AS EMPTY FORMU LAE AND BY DR SPAULDINGS PROLONGED AND CRUSHING REJOINDER TO HIS CRITIC A LIVELY ACADEMIC SCRIMMAGE FURNISHES MORE OR LESS ENTERTAINMENT TO THE NONCOMBATANTS WHO WITNESS IT BUT AT LEAST ONE LISTENER WOULD HAVE BEEN SATISFIED WITH A MUCH BRIEFER ATTACK AND REJOINDER THE REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED WERE WHAT THE GUIDING PRINCIPLES ARE WHICH WITH OUR PRESENT INSIGHT WILL SERVE AS THE BASIS OF HW THE STUDY OF PROFITABLE EXPERIMENTING IN THE ORGANIZATION AND ADMINIS HOW THE STUDY OF SCHOOL ADMINISTRATRATION OF PUBLICSCHOOL SYSTEMS HOW THESE PRINCIPLES ARE TION MAY BE MADE DERIVED AND HOW THEY MAY BE EFFECTIVELY ASSIMILATED BY THE PROFITABLE NEOPHYTE IN THE FIELD OF SCHOOL SUPERVISION AND BY THE EX PERIENCED PRINCIPAL OR SUPERINTENDENT WHO RETURNS TO THE UNIVERSITY FOR INSIGHT GUIDANCE AND INSPIRATION ALL THREE OF THE PRINTED PAPERS EN DEAVORED TO PRESENT SUCH PRINCIPLES OR AT LEAST TO MAKE IT CLEAR WHERE IN THE OPINION OF THE WRITERS SUCH PRINCIPLES WERE TO BE FOUND AND DR SPAULDING AND PROFESSOR ELLIOTT PRESENTED TOPICAL OUTLINES OF COURSES OF INSTRUCTION IN WHICH THESE PRINCIPLES WERE EMBODIED IN PART AT LEAST DR SPAULDINGS PAPER ALSO SUGGESTED THE GENERAL METHOD WHEREBY THESE PRINCI 426EDITORIAL NOTES PLES MIGHT BE ASSIMILATED BY THE STUDENT AFTER POINTING OUT THAT THE FACTS OF ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION CONSTITUTE THE ONLY SOURCE OF THE DESIRED PRINCIPLES AND THAT THE THREE SOURCES OF THESE FACTS ARE HIS THE STUDENTS OWN EXPERIENCE OF SCHOOL CONDITIONS HIS IMMEDIATE DIRECT OBSERVATION OF SCHOOLS AND THEIR ADMINISTRATION AND THE LITERATURE OF THE SUBJECT HE MADE THE FOLLOWING IMPORTANT SUGGESTION EVERY PROFESSOR OF EDUCATION WHO IS TO GIVE A COURSE IN SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION SHOULD IF POSSIBLE FORM A LIMITED WORKING PARTNERSHIP WITH AT LEAST ONE SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT BETTER WITH SEVERAL THIS PARTNERSHIP SHOULD INSURE TO THE PROFESSOR AND HIS STUDENTS UNDER WHATEVER RESTRICTIONS IT MIGHT BE BEST TO IMPOSE ACCESS TO THE ADMIN ISTRATIVE CENTERTHE THOUGHT AND MOTOR CENTEROF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM FROM THIS STANDPOINT THEY SHOULD CARRY ON CONTINUED STUDIES OF ACTUAL PLANS AND PROBLEMS OF ADMINISTRATION WITH WHICH THE SUPERINTENDENT MIGHT BE OCCUPIED MUCH STUDY OF SUCH REAL CONCRETE AND LOCALIZED PROBLEMS OF ADMINISTRATION AND SUCH STUDY ONLY CAN YIELD THE GUIDING PRINCIPLES THE TONE AND TEMPER OF MIND THE BROAD OUTLOOK THE CLEAR INSIGHT AND THE COURAGEOUS WILL THAT ARE INDISPENSABLE TO THE EFFICIENT ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER THIS CLEAR STATEMENT OF THE DIFFICULTIES TO BE SOLVED IN GIVING A UNIVERSITY COURSE IN SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION AND THE FRUITFUL SUGGESTION OF THE POSSIBLE SOLUTION OF MANY OF THEM HAVE NEVER BEFORE BEEN PRESENTED TO THE ASSEMBLED PROFESSORS OF EDUCATION A CYNIC LISTENING TO THE DISCUSSION AT THE MEETING MIGHT HAVE SAID THAT MOST OF US WERE NOT YET READY TO STUDY SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION MUCH LESS TO GIVE A UNIVERSITY COURSE IN THAT SUBJECT THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE CYNICS VIEW WOULD HAVE BEEN FOUND IN THE FACT THAT WE WERE APPARENTLY LOOKING FOR THE PRINCIPLES OF SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION ELSEWHERE THAN IN SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION ITSELF THERE WAS MUCH TALK OF THE SCIENCESECONOMICS SOCIOLOGY ETHICS PHI LOSOPHY PSYCHOLOGYFROM WHICH THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER IS TO DERIVE GUIDANCE AND INSPIRATION AND IN WHICH ACCORDINGLY THE UNIVERSITY TEACHER OF SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION IS TO FIND THE FACTS AND PRINCIPLES WHICH THE STUDENT IS TO LEARN BUT THERE WAS COMPARATIVELY LITTLE REFERENCE TO THE STUDY OF SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION ITSELF AS THE REAL SOURCE OF GUIDANCE AND INSPIRA TION TO BOTH PROFESSOR AND STUDENTA POINT ON WHICH DR SPAULDING HAD LAID SPECIAL STRESS ONLY ONE MAN VENTURED TO GIVE ANY DEFINITE ANSWER TO THE POINTED QUESTIONS OF PROFESSOR DEGARMO WHO WANTED SOMEONE TO STATE EXPLICITLY WHAT SOME OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION ARE ONE CANNOT HELP SHARING THE CYNICS VIEW THEREFORE TO SOME EXTENT AT LEAST FOR ON FURTHER REFLECTION IT SEEMS CLEARER THAN EVER THAT THE WAY TO STUDY SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION IS TO STUDY SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION AND NOT TO STUDY THE SOCIAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL SCIENCES HOWEVER GREAT THE VALUE OF A THOROUGH STUDY OF THESE SCIENCES MAY BEAND IT IS VERY GREATAS A PREPA RATION FOR THE STUDY OF SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION PHH 427

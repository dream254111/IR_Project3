J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1013233,THE METHODS OF MAKING LOCAL AGREEMENTS EMPLOYED BY THE PATTERN MAKERS ASSOCIATION OF CHICAGO,I242656,THE METHODS OF MAKING LOCAL AGREEMENTS EMPLOYED BY THE PATTERN MAKERS ASSO CIATION OF CHICAGO1 BY F S DEIBLER NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY THE METHODS OF BARGAINING EMPLOYED BY THE PATTERN MAKERS ASSOCIATION OF CHICAGO ARE IN MANY RESPECTS UNIQUE IN THE FIELD OF TRADE UNION EXPERIENCE IT IS CUSTOMARY TO LOOK UPON A TRADE UNION AS AN ASSOCIATION THAT EXISTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF SECURING AN AGREEMENT WITH EMPLOYERS THROUGH COLLECTIVE ACTION THE TERMS OF SUCH AGREEMENTS ARE ORDINARILY REDUCED TO A WRITTEN CONTRACT WHICH GOVERN THE CONDITIONS OF SERVICER IN RESPECT TO HOURS WAGES ETC FOR A SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME WHILE THE PATTERN MAKERS ASSOCIATION HAS A SCALE ALL CONTRACTS ARE MADE WITH INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYERS AND THE AGREEMENTS ARE ALWAYS VERBAL THE OFFICIALS OF THE CHICAGO ASSOCIATION CLAIM THAT THEY HAVE HAD BUT ONE STRIKE IN FOURTEEN YEARS AND THAT THIS DISPUTE WAS IN REALITY A LOCKOUT RATHER THAN A STRIKE THE STRENGTH OF THIS ORGANIZATION LIES IN THREE THINGS 1 PATTERN MAKING IS HIGHLY SKILLED WORK 2 THE SMALL NUMBER OF MEN ORDINARILY EMPLOYED IN A SHOP FOUR OR FIVE MEN IS THE USUAL NUMBER FOUND IN A SHOP ALTHOUGH SOME SHOPS IN THE CITY EMPLOY AS MANY AS SIXTEEN OR EIGHTEEN MEN2 THE SMALLER NUMBER OF MEN USUALLY INVOLVED IN A GRIEVANCE RENDERS THE FINANCIAL STRAIN OF MAINTAINING THESE MEN TILL THE DISPUTE IS ADJUSTED LESS SEVERE THAN FOR MOST UNIONS THE LARGEST JOBBING SHOP IN CHICAGO IS ONE THAT THE UNION ITSELF ASSISTED IN ESTABLISHING THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS SHOP TO THE SUCCESSFUL OPERATION OF THE METHODS EMPLOYED BY THIS UNION WILL BE DESCRIBED LATER 3 BECAUSE THE PATTERN MAKERS ARE A SMALL COMPACT GROUP OF SKILLED WORKMEN ORGANIZATION CAN BE MADE MORE EASILY EFFECTIVE THE OFFICERS OF THE UNION ESTIMATE THAT THERE ARE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED 1 THE INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THIS ARTICLE WAS COLLECTED IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN INVESTIGATIONS MADE BY THE AUTHOR FOR THE UNITED STATES COMMISSION ON INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS 2 ACCORDING TO A STATEMENT BY THE LOCAL OFFICERS THE ALLISCHALMERS PLANT AT MILWAUKEE EMPLOYS ABOUT 200 PATTERN MAKERS WHICH PROBABLY MAKES THIS THE LARGEST PATTERNMAKING PLANT IN THE COUNTRY 208LOCAL AGREEMENTS OF PATTERN MAKERS ASSOCIATION 209 PATTERN MAKERS IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO AND THAT 95 PER CENT OF THESE ARE MEMBERS OF THE UNION ON ACCOUNT OF THESE CONDITIONS AND BY MEANS OF APPRENTICESHIP AND OTHER RULES THE UNION IS ABLE TO MAINTAIN A MORE COMPLETE CONTROL OVER THE SUPPLY OF LABOR AND THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT THAN IS POSSIBLE BY MANY LARGER ORGANI ZATIONS IN NEGOTIATING WITH EMPLOYERS THE LOCAL ASSOCIATION EXERCISES A LARGE DEGREE OF FREEDOM THE LAWS OF THE PATTERN MAKERS LEAGUE THE NATIONAL UNION IN THIS INDUSTRY DO SET SOME LIMITS ON THE ACTION OF LOCAL ASSOCIATIONS AFFILIATED WITH THE NATIONAL UNION BUT THESE RULES DO NOT PLACE A VERY STRICT LIMITATION ON LOCAL ACTIVITY THE MOST IMPORTANT RULES OF THE LEAGUE ARE THOSE GOVERNING APPREN TICESHIP3 THOSE PROHIBITING MEMBERS FROM WORKING ON PIECE PRE MIUM BONUS OR CONTRACT WORK4 AND A DECLARATION IN OPPOSITION TO STRIKES AND FAVORABLE TO ARBITRATION AND CONCILIATION AS THE BEST METHODS OF ADJUSTING GRIEVANCES5 THE RULE GOVERNING THE PRO CEDURE IN THE CASE OF A GRIEVANCE IS AS FOLLOWS THE LOCAL ASSOCIATION MUST AT A SPECIALLY CALLED MEETING DECIDE BY A TWOTHIRDS VOTE OF THE MEMBERS PRESENT TO LAY THEIR CASE BEFORE THE EMPLOYERS IN VOLVED THE ASSOCIATION MUST THEN NOTIFY THE GENERAL PRESIDENT WHO EITHER PERSONALLY OR SOME REPRESENTATIVE OF THE LEAGUE DELE GATED BY HIM PROCEEDS TO THE SCENE OF THE CONTROVERSY AND EN DEAVORS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE LOCALEXECUTIVE COMMITTEE TO EFFECT A SETTLEMENT FAILING IN THIS A LOCAL MAY RESORT TO A STRIKE6 THIS RULE OF THE LEAGUE IS OF SLIGHT CONSEQUENCE AS A MEANS OF RESTRICTING INDEPENDENT LOCAL ACTION THE ONLY ADVANTAGE THAT WOULD ACCRUE TO THE LOCAL BY COMPLYING WITH THE RULE WOULD BE THE STRIKE BENEFITS THAT THE MEMBERS WOULD RECEIVE FROM THE FUNDS OF THE NATIONAL BODY AS THE NUMBER OF MEMBERS INVOLVED IN ANY ONE DISPUTE IS SO SMALL THIS RULE CAN HAVE LITTLE EFFECT ON THE DETERMINATION OF LOCAL POLICY EVEN IN TIMES OF A DISPUTE THE LOCAL COULD CARRY THE FINAN CIAL BURDEN OF A DISPUTE IN CASE IT SAW FIT TO DO SO HOWEVER AS STATED ABOVE IT IS CONTRARY TO THE POLICY OF THE CHICAGO ASSOCIATION TO ENGAGE IN STRIKES THE LEAGUE HAS ANOTHER RULE PROHIBITING OVER TIME EXCEPT IN CASES OF ABSOLUTE NECESSITY7 WHICH MEANS PRAC 3 CONST PATTERN MAKERS LEAGUE 1913 P 19 4 IBID P 22 6 IBID P 7 6 IBID P 17 7 IBID P 22THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY TICALLY NOTHING THERE ARE NO RESTRICTIONS ON LOCAL ACTION IN RESPECT TO WAGES AND HOURS THE WAGE SCALE OF THE CHICAGO PATTERN MAKERS ASSOCIATION VARIES FOR DIFFERENT KINDS OF SHOPS TWO PRINCIPAL KINDS OF SHOPS EMPLOY PATTERN MAKERS FIRST THE GENERAL MANUFACTURING PLANT THAT MAINTAINS ITS OWN PATTERN SHOP SOME OF THESE SHOPS IN CHI CAGO MAY EMPLOY ONLY TWO OR THREE MEN WHILE OTHERS MAY HAVE AS MANY AS FOURTEEN TO SIXTEEN MEN SECOND THE JOBBING HOUSES MANY MANUFACTURING PLANTS FIND IT MORE ECONOMICAL TO LET CONTRACTS FOR THEIR PATTERNS RATHER THAN TO ATTEMPT TO RUN A SHOP OF THEIR OWN THE WAGE SCALE IN THE GENERAL MANUFACTURING PLANTS IS FIFTY CENTS PER HOUR IN SOME OF THE JOBBING SHOPS THE SCALE IS AS HIGH AS SIXTY CENTS PER HOUR8 LACK OF UNIFORMITY IS FOUND LIKEWISE IN REGARD TO THE HOURS OF WORK SOME PLANTS WORK AS FEW AS EIGHT HOURS PER DAY WHILE OTHERS WORK EIGHT AND ONEHALF AND SOME AS MANY AS NINE HOURS PER DAY THE OFFICERS OF THE UNION STATED THAT THE PATTERN MAKING DEPARTMENT OF THE ILLINOIS STEEL PLANT WORKS TEN HOURS PER DAY BUT THAT THIS IS A NONUNION SHOP AND THE CONDITIONS HERE ARE UNUSUAL THE CHICAGO PATTERN MAKERS ASSOCIATION HAS A PECULIAR METHOD OF CONTROLLING THE WAGE SCALE AND CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT FOR MANY YEARS WHEN NEW DEMANDS WERE MADE THE MEN WERE TOLD BY THE EMPLOYERS THAT THE BUSINESS COULD NOT STAND THE ADDED EXPENSE THE UNION OFFICERS HAD NO POSITIVE EVIDENCE AS TO THE ACCURACY OF THIS STATEMENT AT THE PRESENT TIME HOWEVER THE OFFICIALS OF THE UNION CAN KNOW WITH REASONABLE ACCURACY WHAT THE COST OF A PATTERN MAKING DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE TO THE EMPLOYER THIS INFORMATION IS OBTAINED THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE THAT THE UNION HAS GAINED FROM ITS RELATIONS WITH THE AMERICAN PATTERN AND MODEL COMPANY THIS COMPANY IS INCORPORATED UNDER THE LAWS OF ILLINOIS AND HAS BEEN IN OPERATION NOW FOR A PERIOD OF SIX YEARS THE STOCKHOLDERS ARE ALL MEMBERS OF THE CHICAGO PATTERN MAKERS ASSOCIATION THE COMPANY WAS FORMED BY A SUBSCRIPTION OF SHARES ON THE FOLLOWING TERMS THE SHARES WERE ISSUED IN DENOMINATIONS OF 50 ANY MEM BER OF THE PATTERN MAKERS ASSOCIATION DESIRING TO TAKE OUT A SHARE OF STOCK IN THE COMPANY COULD DO SO BY THE PAYMENT OF 5 DOWN AND 1 PER WEEK UNTIL THE FACE VALUE OF THE SHARE HAD BEEN PAID IN IN 8 THIS SCALE DOES NOT INCLUDE THE WAGES PAID IN THE AMERICAN PATTERN AND MODEL COMPANYS SHOP WHICH IS OWNED BY MEMBERS OF THE UNION 210LOCAL AGREEMENTS OF PATTERN MAKERS ASSOCIATION 211 THIS WAY THE PLANT BECAME A CO6PERATIVE UNDERTAKING OWNED AND MANAGED BY MEMBERS OF THE PATTERN MAKERS ASSOCIATION THIS COMPANY IS IN DIRECT COMPETITION WITH ALL OTHER PATTERNMAKING ESTABLISHMENTS IN CHICAGO IN FACT IT IS CLAIMED THAT THIS IS THE LARGEST JOBBING PLANT IN THE CITY AS IT EMPLOYS BETWEEN THIRTY AND FORTY MEN THE SHOP IS RUN WITH STRICTLY UNION LABOR WHICH IS PAID THE BEST WAGES AND IS GIVEN THE SHORTEST HOURS POSSIBLE THE LATEST SAFETY DEVICES ARE USED AND THE GENERAL CONDITIONS OF EM PLOYMENT ARE AS SATISFACTORY AS THEY CAN BE MADE THE WAGE SCALE IN THIS SHOP IS 62 AND 65 CENTS PER HOUR ACCORDING TO THE GRADE OF WORK FOR AN EIGHTHOUR DAY WITH A HALF HOLIDAY ON SATURDAYS IT IS CLAIMED THAT BOTH WAGES AND HOURS ARE MORE FAVORABLE THAN IN ANY OTHER SHOP IN THE CITY9 WHILE THIS SHOP IS A PRIVATE CORPORATION THE PECULIAR RELATION OF THE UNION TO ITS MANAGEMENT GIVES THE UNION A DECIDED ADVAN TAGE IN ITS BARGAINING WITH EMPLOYERS IN OTHER SHOPS THROUGHOUT THE CITY THESE ADVANTAGES MAY BE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS 1 REASONABLY ACCURATE INFORMATION CONCERNING MANUFACTURING CAN BE OBTAINED SHOULD AN EMPLOYER STATE THAT HE COULD NOT AFFORD TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF THE MEN THE OFFICERS OF THE UNION WOULD BE IN A POSITION TO KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THE EMPLOYER WAS MAKING A CORRECT STATEMENT 2 SHOULD THE EMPLOYER REFUSE TO ACCEDE TO THE DEMANDS THE MEN COULD BE PUT TO WORK IN THE SHOP OF THE AMERICAN PATTERN AND MODEL COMPANY FROM THE NATURE OF THIS TRADE IT FREQUENTLY HAPPENS THAT THESE SAME JOURNEYMEN CAN GO TO THE FIRM FOR WHOM THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING AND SECURE A CONTRACT FOR THE PATTERN WORK OF THIS PLANT THE FIRM HAS KNOWN THE WORK OF THIS JOURNEYMAN AND IF THE FIRM WAS SATISFIED VERY OFTEN THE WORK WILL FOLLOW THE JOURNEYMAN IN THIS WAY THE JOURNEYMEN MAY IN CASE OF A DIS PUTE ACTUALLY INCREASE THE WORK OF THE AMERICAN PATTERN AND MODEL COMPANY WHILE IT IS TRUE THAT THE SPACE CONTROLLED BY THIS FIRM IS LIMITED THE OFFICIALS OF THE UNION POINT TO THE POSSIBILITY ALTHOUGH IT HAS NEVER BEEN DONE OF RENTING ADDITIONAL SPACE AND OF PUTTING THE MEN TO WORK IF CONDITIONS IN THE INDUSTRY WARRANTED IT EVEN IF THE MEN WERE NOT PUT TO WORK THEY COULD BE PUT ON STRIKE BENEFITS WHICHEVER WAY THE MATTER IS HANXLED THE EFFECT ON THE EMPLOYER IS THE SAME FOR SINCE THE UNION HAS SO LARGE CONTROL OVER THE SKILLED 9 THE AMERICAN PATTERN AND MODEL COMPANY HAS CONSTRUCTED A NEW BUILD ING AT A COST OF 20000 THIS NEW BUILDING HAS GREATLY INCREASED THE SPACE AND EFFICIENCY OF ITS WORK NO DIVIDENDS HAVE BEEN DECLARED TO DATE AS ALL OF THE EARN INGS HAVE BEEN PUT BACK INTO THE PLANT AND EQUIPMENTTHE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY PATTERN MAKERS THE EMPLOYER IS PRACTICALLY FORCED TO GET ANY ADDI TIONAL WORKMEN THROUGH THE UNION NEW MEN WILL NOT BE FURNISHED EXCEPT AT THE RATES DEMANDED THIS EXPLAINS WHY IT IS NOT NECES SARY FOR THE PATTERN MAKERS TO STRIKE THE FOREGOING METHOD CAN BE USED EVEN THOUGH THERE IS NO DISPUTE WHENEVER THE UNION DECIDES THAT ANY PARTICULAR SHOP IS PAYING LESS OR WORKING LONGER HOURS THAN IT SHOULD THE MEN MAY BE WITHDRAWN AND PUT TO WORK IN THEIR OWN SHOP WHEN THE EMPLOYER CALLS FOR MORE MEN HE IS INFORMED THAT THE CONDITIONS AS TO WAGES OR HOURS IN HIS SHOP ARE NOT SATISFACTORY HE IS TOLD THAT IF HE EXPECTS TO HOLD HIS MEN IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO PAY A LITTLE MORE OR TO GIVE HIS MEN BETTER CONDITIONS IN THIS WAY THE UNION HAS USED ITS RELATIONS WITH THE AMERICAN PATTERN AND MODEL COMPANY TO IMPROVE WORKING CONDITIONS FOR ITS MEMBERS THE RELATION OF THE UNION TO THIS COMPANY GIVES THE UNION A LINE UPON ANOTHER PROBLEM IN THE INDUSTRY FOR A LONG TIME ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL MENACES TO STANDARD CONDITIONS WAS THE SMALL PATTERN MAKER WHO WOULD UNDERBID THE UNION SCALE IN ORDER TO GET A JOB HAVING SECURED THE CONTRACT HE WOULD WORK LONG HOURS AND IF HE REQUIRED HELP ON THE JOB HE WOULD PAY THE LOWEST RATES MORE BECAUSE OF THE HOURS WORKED THAN THE WAGES PAID THIS SMALL PATTERN MAKER WAS A DISTURBING FACTOR TO THE INDUSTRY TWO THINGS ARE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE AMERICAN PATTERN AND MODEL COM PANY WHICH ARE VERY USEFUL TO THE UNION IN ITS ATTEMPTS TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM SOME OF THESE SMALL JOBBERS ARE MEMBERS OF THE UNION FREQUENTLY THIS FACT IS FOUND OUT THROUGH THE COMPANY IN THIS WAY THE COMPANY HAS SUBMITTED A BID ON A JOB AND FAILS TO SECURE IT BEING AN INTERESTED PARTY THE OFFICIALS OF THE COMPANY MAKE INQUIRIES AS TO WHO OBTAINED THE WORK THUS MEMBERS OF THE PATTERN MAKERS ASSOCIATION WHO ARE INCLINED TO BREAK DOWN UNION STANDARDS MAY BE DETECTED AND THEREAFTER DISCIPLINED IN THE SECOND PLACE THE JOBBERS MAY UNDERTAKE TO CUT PRICES FOR JOB BING WORK WITH THE VIEW OF UNDERBIDDING THE AMERICAN PATTERN AND MODEL COMPANY AND THUS DRIVING THE COMPANY OUT OF BUSINESS HOWEVER THE COMPANY HAS THE ADVANTAGE IN COMPETITION OF THIS CHARACTER BECAUSE IT DOES NOT HAVE TO EARN A PROFIT THE STOCK HOLDERS ARE MORE INTERESTED IN CONTINUOUS EMPLOYMENT THAN IN THE DIVIDENDS DECLARED ON THEIR SHARES THEREFORE THIS COMPANY CAN AFFORD TO TAKE WORK AT COST OF PRODUCTION AND CONTINUE TO OPERATE 212LOCAL AGREEMENTS OF PATTERN MAKERS ASSOCIATION 213 INDEFINITELY ON THAT BASIS BESIDES THE SMALL JOBBER CANNOT HANDLE THE LARGER ORDERS BECAUSE HE IS NOT EQUIPPED EITHER AS TO SPACE OR TOOLS FOR HANDLING THE LARGER WORK THEREFORE THIS KIND OF COMPETI TION IS RESTRICTED TO THE SMALLER JOBS THE POWER OF THE UNION THROUGH ITS CONNECTIONS WITH THIS COMPANY WHETHER CONSIDERED IN ITS RELATION TO THE SMALL JOBBING COMPETITOR OR TO THE EMPLOYER UNWILLING TO PAY THE SCALE IS IN A LARGE MEASURE A POTENTIAL FORCE HOW EXTENSIVELY IT IS USED DEPENDS UPON THE URGENCY OF THE CASE IN THIS UNIQUE WAY A SMALL COMPACT GROUP OF SKILLED WORKMEN HAVE ORGANIZED AND CARRY ON REGULAR TRADE UNION FUNCTIONS AGREE MENTS WITH THE EMPLOYER WHILE CONFORMING TO THE NORMAL REPRE SENTATIVE METHODS THROUGH UNION OFFICIALS ARE MORE COMPLETELY INDIVIDUALIZED THAN IS USUAL IN COLLECTIVE TRADE UNION ACTION THE AGREEMENT IS ALWAYS VERBAL AND BECAUSE OF THE CHARACTER OF THE WORK IT IS FREQUENTLY IN RESPECT TO A PARTICULAR MAN IT MAY HAPPEN THAT ONLY A VERY FEW MEN ARE CAPABLE OF MAKING THE KIND OF PATTERN SPECIFIED BUT WHETHER THIS BE THE CASE OR NOT THE OFFICER OF THE UNION IS CALLED UPON TO FURNISH A SPECIFIED NUMBER OF MEN WHO ARE CAPABLE OF DOING A DEFINITE KIND OF WORK THROUGH ITS CONNECTIONS WITH THE AMERICAN PATTERN AND MODEL COMPANY THE UNION HOLDS A STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE IN ITS ENDEAVORS TO PROTECT AND IMPROVE WORK ING CONDITIONS THAT IS POSSESSED BY FEW IF ANY OTHER UNIONS IN THE COUNTRY NO ATTEMPT IS HERE MADE TO ARGUE THAT THE EXPERIENCE OF THIS UNION CAN BE EXTENDED SUCCESSFULLY TO OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THE INFORMATION IS PRESENTED TO SHOW WHAT DIFFERENT METHODS MAY BE EMPLOYED BY TRADE UNIONS AS AIDS IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

describing the specimens was at first entrusted to Mr E E Austen the dipterist on the staff of the museum but later he volunteered for active service in South Africa and joined the City Imperial Vol unteers Apart from his duties as a soldier Mr Austen has we hear done useful service in his capacity of naturalist in the South African Field Force There are not many professional dip terists in this country and it was therefore fortunate that the director of the museum Pro fessor Ray Lankester was able to obtain the services of Mr F V Theobald a graduate of the University of Cambridge who is one of the few men in England who has studied mosqui toes to carry on the work in Mr Austens absence Mr Theobald is now engaged in the preparation of a monograph on mosquitoes based on the collections at the museum the printing of which has been sanctioned by the trustees Pending the issue of this catalogue it has been thought desirable for the satisfaction of those who have been at the trouble to make the collections to print a preliminary report of the progress made by Mr Theobald in identifying the specimens already received The com bined collections contain a large number of spe cies the majority belonging to the genus Culex Mr Theobald at present has completed the genus Anopheles which has been hopelessly convicted of being the medium by which the malaria parasite is transmitted from person to person The genus is represented in the mu seum by 22 species 10 of which are new to sci ence The Anopheles unlike the comparatively inocuous Culex does not appear to have a wide distribution in regard to species although the genus is worldwide One of the greatest dis tances between any two localities for the same species is Formosa and the Straits Settlements A long series sent by Mr Wray from the Straits Settlements contained 66 Anopheles and 72 Culex the former being remarkable for their great variation both in color and in size Whereas all the other specimens of the genus received appear very constant in color and markings Some species of Culex seem to have a very wide distribution Thus one species has been sent from the following widelyseparated localities Japan Formosa Hongkong Ma lay Peninsula India South and West Africa North and South America West Indies and Gibralter As many of the species are very ob scure photographs of the wings and drawings of various parts are being prepared and com plete figures of the majority of species will also be given in the proposed monograph The col lection and preservation of these tiny and very delicate insects are a most difficult matter in volving unwearied patience and extreme care The fact that most of the collections have ar rived at the museum from remote parts of the world in fair condition says much for the zeal and care with which the gentlemen concerned have endeavored to carry out the wishes of the Colonial Secretary in this important investiga tion YELLOW FEVER AND MOSQUITOES A PRELIMINARY paper on the etiology of yel low fever by Walter Reed surgeon United States army and James Carroll A Agramonte Jesse W Lazear assistant surgeons United States army was read at the recent meeting of the American Public Health Association at Indianapolis and is published in the last issue of the Philadelphia Medical Journal It appears that in eleven cases in which nonimmune indi viduals were inoculated through the bites of mosquitoes culex fasciatus two attacks of yel low fever followed and that another attack is directly traced to the bite of a contaminated mosquito The authors conclude as follows For ourselves we have been profoundly im pressed with the mode of infection and with the results that followed the bite of the mosquito in these three cases Our results would appear to throw new light on Carters observations in Mississippi as to the period required between the introduction of the first infecting case and the occurrence of secondary cases of yellow fever Since we here for the first time record a case in which a typical attack of yellow fever has followed the bite of an infected mosquito within the usual period of incubation of the disease and in which other sources of infection can be 692 SCIENCENIOVEMBER 2 1900 excluded we feel confident that the publication of these observations must excite renewed in terest in the mosquitotheory of the propagation of yellow fever as first proposed by Finlay From the first part of our study of yellow fever we draw the following conclusions 1 The blood taken during life from the gen eral venous circulation on various days of the disease in 18 cases of yellow fever successively studied has given negative results as regards the presence of B icteroides 2 Cultures taken from the blood and organs of 11 yellow fever cadavers have also proved negative as regards the presence of this bacillus 3 Bacillus icteroides Sanarelli stands in no causative relation to yellow fever but when present should be considered as a secondary invader in this disease From the second part of our study of yellow fever we draw the following conclusions The mosquito serves as the intermediate host for the parasite of yellow fever and it is highly probable that the disease is only propagated through the bite of this insect SCIENTIFIC NOTES AND NEWS PROFESSOR S P LANGLEY director of the Smithsonian Institution returned to the

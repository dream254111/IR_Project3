j101009,The Virginia Law Register,1098574,Merger of Estates,i245868,VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER VOL V FEBRUARY 1900 No 10 MERGER OF ESTATES Merger is peculiarly a legal doctrine its rules and the circumstances essential to its application at law must be held in view in any discus sion of the manner in which equity deals with the subject when in its jurisdiction the question whether or not merger will occur arises The object of the doctrine of merger is to accelerate the possession or at least the estate in which the drowning takes place The reason of merger is1 that when the circumstances concur upon which merger may be based the estates are inconsistent it would be absurd to allow one person to have two distinct estates immediately expectant on each other while one of them includes the time of both Nemo potest esse dominus et tenens It would be absurd for the law to admit that the same person had two distinct estates when the time of one was in construction of law equal to and involved in the time of the other Another authority explains its reason to be that as all inferior estates and interests in land are derived out of the feesimple there fore whenever a particular estate or limited interest in land vests in him who has the feesimple of the same land such particular estate or limited interest is immediately drowned in the fee upon the principle omne majus continet in se minus2 The governing principle of merger at law is not the intention of the parties for while in some instances the doctrine from favor to the in tention of the parties is held inapplicable yet in others merger is consequent upon the union of two estates in direct opposition to the intention of the parties either expressed or implied3 Merger is distinguished from Suspension from Extinguishment and from Surrender 1 Mayhew The Law of Merger 2 4 Kents Corn 99 2 Cruises Digest Vol I 70 3 Mayhew 62 Cruises Dig Vol VI 487VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Suspension is defined as a partial absorption occasioned by the tem porary union of two estates or interests Extinguishment is the annihilation of a collateral right or interest in the subject out of which it is derived as when a rent charge in fee and the fee itself become vested in the same person or as a confusion of rights as when a debtor becomes the owner of his debt As distinguished from surrender merger is merely the consequence of a rule of law the estate must be transferred and have continuance in the transferee before the rule of law can come into effect while the annihilation produced by surrender is identical with and immediately caused by the surrender itself The effect of both are the same but the modes of their operation differ To be subject to merger the two estates must be the two vested estates which are to take effect immediately after each othersubject to the qualification however that if the two estates are of freehold tenure an intermediate estate for years will not prevent the merger2 As a rule it is absolutely necessary that the latter estate should be connected with the former estate and be immediately expectant there on so as to come into its place on the determination of that estate There must also be a privity of right and title between the estates the several successive estates must relate to the same share For in stance if A and B are tenants in common in fee and A settles his moiety on C for life and the reversion of B descends to C the estates of C will remain distinct For these estates exist in an equal share in the same lands but they clearly exist in different shares As between the two estates there is not any privity or connection in title no de pendence of one estate on the other The estate for the life of C is derived from the title of A while the reversion in fee is derived un der the title of B It is therefore impossible for one estate to blend with the other There is a want of that privity of right and title essen tial to merger3 Equal estates of freehold the one in possession the other in re mainder will not merge although they may meet in the same person and it has been laid down as an authoritatively established rule that there can be no merger between equal estates of freehold whether the 1 Mayhew 7 2 Bates Case 1 Salk 254 3 Church v Edwards 2 Bro C C 180 Mayhew 75 Preston Conveyancing Vol III 90 See also 1 Russ 200  Mayhew 49 Cruises Dig VI 477 652 FebMERGER OF ESTATES estate in which the merger is proposed be in remainder or in reversion to the estate to be drowned1 An estate for the life of another will merge in an estate for the ten ants own life 2 yet this is no exception to the rule just given for the reason of it is that an estate pur autre vie is as to the tenant himself accounted by the law to be of less extent and importance than an estate for his own life8 It follows that in the application of the doctrine of merger nu merical values are not considered Estates for years may merge in each other when the term in which the merger is to occur is by way of reversion to the term in possession thus in the case of Stephens v Bridges Madd  Geld Eng 66 a term of 1000 years in possession was held to merge in a term of 500 years in reversion and so a term of fifty years in possession will merge in a term of only twenty years in reversion so that the tenant will have only the time of the reversionary term the reason being that it is absurd that the relations dominus et tenens should meet in the same person and it is all one if the estate in reversion be for a greater number of years or not4 But if the second term be by way of remainder both estates are equal they may coexist in the same person in the same right as continuing interests because the incompatible relations of dominus et tenens not meeting in the same person do not call for the absorption of the one in the other5 Thus it appears that a valid distinction is taken between estates in remainder and estates in reversion and a further illustration is afforded of the rule that relative rank and not numerical value is regarded in the application of the doctrine of merger The more remote estate must be as large as or larger than the more immediate estate If a lease be made to one for years and a further limitation by way of remainder to the same person for life the estate for years will merge in the estate for life If a man takes a lease for a term of years and afterwards takes an interest for term of life to take effect immediately the lease for years is extinct But where one leases to A for life and twenty years over there A shall have both 1 Bissett on Estates for Life 181 2 Lewis Bowles Case 11 Rep 83 3 Mayhew 52 4 Mayhew 100 5Cruises Dig VI 478 72 Mayhew 105 See Preston Conveyancing Vol III 201 1900 653654 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb estates and if a man leases to another for life remainder to him for twentyone years he has both estates in him distinct and may grant away either of them for a greater estate may uphold a lesser but not e converso and this term is a more remote estate and an estate for life is larger than an estate for years1 It is unnecessary here to discuss the question of merger when the estates are held in different rights or the doctrine of merger as applied to entailed estates Mr Preston2 makes the following summary of the rules applicable to merger and of the circumstances essential to the application of the doctrine  First Two or more estates must meet in the same person in the same lands or in the same part of the same lands  Second The more remote estate must be the next vested estate in remainder or reversion without any intervening vested estate and also without any inter vening interest by way of contingent remainder created in the same instant of time or by the same act which gives origin to the other estates  Third The estate in reversion or remainder must be as large as or larger than the preceding estate  Fourth The several estates must be held in the same legal right or when the estates are held in different legal rights one of them must not be an accession to the other merely by act of the law Fifth The estates must not be privileged under the Statute of Uses or the Statute of Entails Sixth The doctrine will not have the effect to alter the quality of one of two estates in the same person or to destroy a contingent remainder3 when the several estates are limited by the same instrument or deed or take their effect in the same instant of time and in some degree by the same act and some other per son is concerned in the consequence of the merger  Seventh The doctrine does not apply to an estate for several lives arising un der the same limitation as giving one entire and undivided time of continuance  Eighth The union of two estates in the same person by means of the joint act of the respective owners of these estates with an intention that the estate of their assignee shall continue for the collective time of their several estates will not be a cause of merger Whenever the legal and equitable estates in the same lands meet in the same person in the same right and are coextensive and com mensurate there merger will ensue For the reason according to some authorities4 that the law regards a legal estate as superior in rank to an equitable estate and therefore 1 Mayhew 79 2Preston Conv III 50 3 Cf Code of Va 1887 sec 2425 4Pomeroys Eq Jur sec 787the reason of merger being present the ordinary rules of merger ap ply According to other authorities and probably with more show of reason it is because by such a union a confusion of rights is pro duced and extinguishment follows for no man can be trustee for him self no man may have a subpoena against himself There is some conflict among the textwriters as to whether or not the equitable estate must be commensurate and coextensive with the legal estate Mr Pomeroy saying that when a legal and a less equi table estate meet in the same person merger follows to the same effect is Perry on Trusts sec 347 though no citation of authorities in his support is made by him Yet the authorities cited by Pomeroy3 ex pressly declare that the two estates must be coextensive and com mensurate To the same effect are the authorities cited below In no instance can the legal merge in the equitable estate The effect of merger upon the estate merged is as above stated anni hilation yet persons having interests affecting it will be left in the same condition in point of benefit as if no merger had occurred5 The effect of merger upon the estate in which the drowning occurs is to subject the reversion or remainder thus accelerated to all those bur dens and consequences which would have attached if the prior estate had not existed and in the same order or series of time as if that estate were determined thus the possession will be chargeable during the period appointed for the continuance of the drowned estate with all the encumbrances which affected that estate and also by way of ac celeration with the encumbrances upon the estate accelerated6 The case of Browne v Bockover 84 Va 424 is an illustration of this principle although decided without reference to the rule given In Equity the question of whether or not merger will occur arises in the case of legal estates and of equitable and legal estates in the same lands meeting No question can arise of merger between equitable estates for an equi table estateand this comprehends equitable encumbrancescan not merge in an equitable estate  The equitable estate is a mere creature of the court and subsists in idea only as to any legal consequences 1 Mayhew 9 Fonblanques Eq II 163 Brydges v Brydges 3 Ves jun 125 2Pomeroys Eq Jur sec 787 3Selby v Alston 3 Ves jun 339 Brydges v Brydges supra 4

right complete in itself entirely separate from the legal estate and of any number of trusts declared or implied upon any property each trust or equitable estate is in reality a rightan entire estateperfect and complete in itself With reference to its rank or quality each equitable estate is co ordinate with every other equitable estate based upon the same legal fee each being perfect and complete in itself and enforceable in the same manner i e by the aid of a court of equity and equitable estates measure their difference one with another not by rank or quality as do legal estates but by numerical value Since merger a legal doctrine is based not on numerically differing values but on the different rank or quality of estates since the reason of merger that one estate is greater than or contains the time of the other or that the incompatible relations of lord and tenant or trustee and cestui que trust meeting in the same person at the same timemust be present or merger would be an absurdity since in order for the doctrine of merger to be applicable the two estates of which one is to drown the other must be carved out of and a part of the same fee simple estate and since see p 654 supra there must be a privity of right and title between the estates it necessarily follows that in the case of two or more equitable estates which are coordinate in rank each being in itself a complete and perfect estate of which one is not a part of nor has its time comprehended by the time of the other which have no privity of right or title between themselves in the meeting of which no confusion of rights such as to afford a reason of merger is produced merger cannot occur so as to drown one in the other2 1 Brydges v Brydges 3 Ves jun 126 Philips v Brydges 2 In the case of Allen v Patrick 5 Va Law Reg 523 1 Va S C R 561 recently decided the court seems to say that merger is possible between equitable estates or encumbrances although the legal titleas in that casebe outstanding So far as the writer can ascertain this marks a radical change in the doctrine of merger But with all deference to the court I suggest that a mistake has been made in that opin ion in ascribing to Pomeroy the following citation used as an authority upon which to base the ruling of the court  Where the owner of an estate becomes also the owner of an encumbrance on it such encumbrance shall thereby become extin guished says the law provided however says equity  that it is not his interest or intention to keep such encumbrance alive 2 Pom Eq Juris sec 790 2 Pom Eq Juris sec 790 reads as follows  When the owner of the fee becomes absolutely en titled in his own right to a charge or encumbrance upon the same land with no in tervening interest or lien the charge will at law merge in the ownership and cease to exist Under like circumstances a merger will take place in equity where no inten tion to prevent it has been expressed and none is implied from the circumstances 656 FebMERGER OF ESTATES But this reasoning has no application in the case of encumbraces of such nature that when they meet the hand to pay becomes the hand to receivewhere extinguishment is of course The applications of the equitable doctrine concerning merger says Pomeroy  are various in form although resting upon the same general principle This single principle from which the doctrine in all its modes and forms of application directly results is the fruitful maxim that equity looks at the real intent of the parties as constituting the essential substance and not at the mere external form In this method of viewing the affairs of mankind equity often establishes different rules creating different rights and duties from those which under the same circumstances prevail at law The equi table doctrine of merger is a striking illustration of this most righteous principle and the whole discussion in fact consists in ascertaining when and how a merger which would have been inevitable at law will be prevented or not permitted in equity Equity does not favor merger in any case and will not suffer the destruction of a trust by the application of the doctrine2 it is not like some other doctrines of the law adopted by analogy to the law it is in fact foreign to equity and is never applied by that court as its own doctrine Before there can be any application of the doctrine by a court of equity the foundation for mergerthat is the meeting of legal estates in such manner as to produce merger at law or the meeting of a legal and an equitable estate in the same landsmust exist given such a foundation the court will be guided by the intention of the parties expressed or implied3 In case of the meeting of a legal estate with a coextensive and commensurate equitable estate in the absence of any expression of in tention merger is prima facie the result4 On the other hand when the owner of a legal estate becomes the owner of a lesser equitable estate under such circumstances that at law merger would follow and the interests of the party Through some oversight the language of some other author has been credited to Pomeroy That author in his discussion of merger does sometimes use the word owner without the qualification  legal or of the fee as for instance at the head of page 1097 of his second volume but by reference to the context or to the authorities cited by him it can readily be seen that such a qualification is always to be understood in that connection 1 Pomeroy Eq Jur sec 786 2 Mayhew 23 Forbes v Moffatt 18 Ves Jun 384 Lord Crompton v Oxenden 2 Ves jun 263 4 Wade v Paget 1 Browns C C 363 Mayhew 9 Pomeroy sec 788 1900 657VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER merger does not in equity prima facie result in the absence of an in tention expressed or implied that it shall Likewise when a less equitable estate meets with the fee In fact when this occurs it ap pears doubtful as stated above whether merger at law can take place Sir Rd Pepper Arden M R in Brydges v Brydges 3 Ves jun 125 says  Another position was maintained in a latitude that would create infinite con fusion that where there is in the same person a legal and an equitable interest the former absorbs the latter I admit that where he has the same interest in both he ceases to have the equitable estate and has the legal estate upon which this court will not act but leaves it to the rules of law But it must be under stood always with this restriction that it holds only where the legal and equi table estates are coextensive and commensurate but I do not by any means admit that where he has the whole legal estate and a partial equitable estate the latter sinks into the former for it would be a disadvantage to him All this depends upon the misuse of words In the absence of all facts from which the intention of the party can be gathered the court will be guided by what it considers to be to his interest and advantage1 Whenever the legal owner of land becomes the owner of a charge resting upon the land the charge merges in the legal estate in the same manner as does an equitable estate in the fee and for the same reason viz that no man can be trustee for himself But the equi table doctrine preventing merger is even stronger in this case than in the case of the meeting of two estates And although the rules of equity differently affect tenants in fee tenants for life and tenants in tail in the merger of charges it is nevertheless in each case still a question of intention2 Two principal conditions of fact are to be considered first where the legal owner of the property hecomes by bequest devolution or transfer holder of the charge second where the owner of the pro perty voluntarily pays off the charge First If there be no intervening interest or lien in the absence of an expressed intention to the contrary or one to be implied from the circumstances and interests of the party merger will prima facie re sult this however is in most instan es a mere presumption which may be overcome and sometimes does not arises In the case of a tenant for life a presumption against merger exists 1 Forbes v Moffatt 18 Ves jun 392 2 Forbes v Moffatt 18 Ves jun 391 3 Pomeroy Eq Jur sec 789 658 FebMERGER OF ESTATES If an interest lien or encumbrance intervenes between the legal estate and the encumbrance thought to be affected by merger that doc trine subject to one exception will not be applied The exception is where the owner of the encumbrance is himself the primary and prin cipal debtor In Millspaugh v McBride Chancellor Walworth in a case involving these circumstances said It was in equity impos sible for the prior mortgage or the equitable interest of the defendants therein to unite with their legal title to the equity of redemption by reason of the intermediate equity which the complainant had by virtue of his mortgage The establishment of a different principle would bring us back to the doctrine of tacking or a merger which would cut off the complainants mortgage altogether If the mortgagee is con sidered as holding the legal estate and the mortgagor the mere equity the effect of a merger would be to unite to their prior mortgage the equity of redemption purchased by these defendants so as to over reach the junior encumbrancer altogether at law and leave him to his remedy in equity only And when he comes here to ask equity he must do equity by paying off the first encumbrance 2 In Toumhin v Steere 1807 3 Mer 210 224 Sir Wm Grant M R said The cases of Greswold v Marsham 2 Ch Cas 170 and Mocatta v Murgatroyd 1 P Wms 393 are express authorities to show that one purchasing an equity of redemption cannot set up a prior mortgage of his own and consequently a mortgage which he has got in against a subsequent incumbrance of which he had notice But in 1877 in Adams v Angells the rule quoted was declared to be merely obiter dictum the Master of the Rolls saying If there is no reason for keeping it the encumbrance alive then especially in the case of an owner in fee equity will in the absence of any declaration of his intention destroy it but if there is any reason for keeping it alive such as the existence of another encumbrance equity will not destroy it And since this decision Toulmin v Steere is no longer considered an authority and is regarded as completely overthrown When the owner of the encumbrance is himself the primary debtor and absolutely bound for its payment the presumption is that the en cumbrance is merged4 But under certain circumstances when it is for innocent purposes it will be kept alive5 1 7 Paiges Chy 509 34 Am Pec 360 2 McKinstry v Mervin 3 Johns Ch 446 Crow v Tinsley 6 Dana 402 8 L R S Ch Div 641 et seq 22 Eng Rep 369 et seq 4Pomeroy Eq Jur secs 790 793 794 5Rorer v Ferguson 96 Va 411 1900 659VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Second When the owner in fee pays off a charge Under these cir cumstances the question is whether it is possible in any manner or by any form of proceeding for the party thus paying off a charge to keep it alive whether or not when so doing he takes an assignment of the charge often being immaterial1 If merger can be prevented when the owner of the land pays off the charge the question depends upon intention subject to the rules heretofore stated When the owner of the land is not primarily and personally bound for the debt he may keep it alive if there is such an intention ex pressed or implied And the interests and advantage of the party owning the land are mainly considered in the determination of this question This may be without even a formal assignment of the lien Such persons are for instance grantees of the mortgagor who have not assumed payment of the mortgage heirs devisees and in fact all persons entitled to redeem and not personally liable as principal debtorss If a tenant for life pays off a charge upon land in which he has such life estate he is presumed to do it for his own benefit and the charge is kept alive the simple payment without more being suffi cient for this purpose4 And so with tenants for years and tenants in common The whole question may be summarized by saying that in equity in order for the doctrine of merger to be applied there must first be two or more legal estates in the same land in the same party in the same right at the same time one being immediately expectant upon and larger than the others or other and without any intervening interest or there must be a legal estate and an equitable estate arising out of the same property in the hands of the same person in the same right and at the same time and by equitable estate as here used I mean to include equitable rights charges and encumbrances Given this foundation for merger a court of equity will apply the doctrine or prevent its application according to the intention expressed or im plied the interest and the advantage of the owner of the estates al ways in such manner that no fraud upon others will be perpetrated or aided the presumption for or against merger in every case being sub stantially as has been briefly stated above But unless the requisite foundation for merger exists equity will not supply it and no application of the doctrine of merger is possible5 Staunton Va J M PERRY 1 Pomeroy Eq Jur sec 796 a Id sec 797 and cases cited 3 Id sec 798 Jones Mortgages sec 864 865 4Harman v Forster 1 Dr  Wal 687

j100358,The School Review,1076796,A Problem for the Religious Education Association,i244617,DISCUSSION A PROBLEM FOR THE RELIGIOUS EDUCATION ASSOCIATION FRANK A MANNY Western State Normal School Kalamazoo Michigan The ten quotations omitting the eighth given in the School Review for February I909 p 126 were placed before sixtyone normalschool seniors with the result that after making all due allowance the students showed a better knowledge of the meaning of the allusions than was shown by the highschool pupils It is reasonable to expect that with increasing maturity there would be more control over material of this kind and that this would be especially true of a class selected to become teachers Does it not seem that the frequent statements made as to the ignorance of the Bible manifested by students are overdrawn Is this not a legiti mate field for the Religious Education Association to enter in order to give us some definite basis drawn from the testing of representative public and private institutions of highschool normal and college grade by means of which we can judge better the present status of knowledge or igno rance and so determine means of advance An analysis of the results of such a study would show the chief lines of weakness and strength in our present instruction In the test referred to the following are indications of difficulties Joshuas reasons for the miracle were seldom even hinted at The penalty for Adams sin was variously given as expulsion manual labor and death The last two were sometimes assigned to him and again to future generations as well The cup was occasionally referred to Gethsemane One student mentioned twelve commandments and another evidently considered Exodus a place The tree of life was confused with the other tree Christ was named as the one who gave the commandments to Moses Herod was occasion ally confused with Pharaoh The greatest number of errors occurred in the attempt to place Esau One spoke of Esau selling his birthright with a kiss Others said Esau and Isaac were Jacobs sons Jacob summoned Esau to him and Esau put on a goatskin Esaus hand de ceived him in getting the blessing away from his brother Esaus hand was hairy and Jacob suspected that he was being deceived and Esau told him it was Josephs coat Inexactness and lack of having given thought to the material seem to be the chief defects 1Cf also the School Review for December 90o8 p 680 502

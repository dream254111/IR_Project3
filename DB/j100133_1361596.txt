j100133,The Condor,1361596,The New CheckList,i259128,Mar 1907 55 THE NEW CHECKLIST BY P A TAVERNER W E ARE all more or less interested in the forthcoming checklist now under preparation and most of us have ideas as to what we should like to see therein That everybody should be satisfied with the results whatever they may be is beyond hope No matter what action is taken there are sure to be some disappointed ones Some of the reforms that I personally should like to see come to pass seem beyond the grounds of possibility Such is for instance the suppression of the Law of Priority as interpreted in Canons XIIXIV of the Code The only apparent way to make our nomenclature stable is for the Committee to take highhanded measures and say that soandso shall be the names of the species for all time to come as long as the present system flourishes grammar philology or priority to the con trary notwithstanding This would I am aware raise a storm of protest But the international con fusions arising therefrom certainly would be no greater than they now are and perhaps would be less as conflictions once learned would stay learned and be sub ject to but half the change that they are now The case of Stercorarius farasiticus is a fine example of international discord where the same name applies to two different species according to two current systems of nomenclature It matters very little what a species is called so long as the name is permanent and all know the form to which it applies All our literature refers to Corvuls americanlus What good it has done to change it to bractyrhynchos I fail to see It has antiquated whole shelves of our literature and in this special case has given us a difficult for a simple and thoroly characteristic name The solution however of this question may be as yet far in the future and perhaps belongs to the millennium rather than to the present There are however other desirable things that seem more probable of realiza tion Some of them are mentioned in the last issue of THE CONDOR over the initials J G on page 154 The suggestion of applying qualifying terms to each and all of the varieties of a subspecifically divided species is most wholesome and should be applied to the scientific as well as the vernacular nomenclatural system Modern subspecific ideas should not recognize the superiority of one variety over another without good evolutionary reasons for so doing Why call one form a species and the rest varieties just because one of them had of necessity to be discovered first To do so not only fails to represent the true facts of the case but in many instances actually falsifies them The trinomial system necessitates the consideration of the term species as a collective noun of which the varieties or subspecies are the component parts The western robin is just as much the American robin as the eastern form and as such has just as much right to that name We should then be able to speak of both forms as a whole as the American robin Aierula migraloiia When we are certain of the subspecific identification not always easy or possible or wish to differentiate the two forms we can then say eastern robin M  m migratoria or western robin M m proIin qua as the case may be Without doubt this fact of the equality of all the varieties of a species should be shown graphically in the arrangement of the coming list Heretofore every slight variation that has been56 THE CONDOR VoL IX deemed worthy of separation has been given exactly the same honors in the way of type position etc as the most strongly marked species This lack of graphical coordination in the old lists has I am sure thru subconscious action had much to do with exaltation of subspecies by raising small differences to a prominence in our thoughts far beyond the position to which they are taxonomically entitled The fact that a bird is a horned lark is of far more importance than that it resembles Hoyts form of the species yet the latter minor fact is often dwelt upon with greater vehemence than the former major one I should suggest that the sub species be printed in smaller type than the specific headings and be set back from the margin in a manner that will indicate visually their real taxonomic value as varieties Something like this would I think be acceptable 761 Merula migratoria LINN AMIERICAN ROBIN Synonymy range etc a M mi nigraloria Linn EASTERN ROBIN Range etc b 1 m m ropinqua Ridgw WESTERN ROBIN Range etc The custom of giving a simple name to one species and the same name with a qualifying prefix to the next has in several cases been responsible for much con fusion Had the term water thrush been a generic cognomen and applied to all the members of the genus and had AM noveboracensis been differentiated as northern water thrush the distribution of the species in this locality would not be in the badly mixed state that it is now Another feature that we want to see revised in the new List is the geographical ranges We have acquired a deal of new data on this point since the last List and nothing is more needed at present writing than uptodate geographi cal distributions In regard to the extensive changes proposed in the vernacular names in the editorial above referred to it does not seem to be expedient to make any more changes than is necessary Of course it is just as important that the vernacular nomenclatural tools should be good tools as the scientific ones but fixity in both is equally desirable Adding qualifiers to existing names can cause little confusion but radical changes are apt to do so Not being familiar with the western species I can hardly pass judgment upon many of the proposals made but except in such cases where the name is flagrantly misleading such as calling a quail a partridge or vice versa I should think caution should be practiced We want fixity in the vernacular as well as the scientific systems and minor inconsistencies should be borne with to this end High laund Park 3ichigan

lad renewed its descent it stopped on each occasion abruptly at the original mark to a fathom and would not take an other turn off the reel The velocity with which the line run out was as follows  h m s The first 1000 fathoms in 0 27 15 1000 to 2000 fathoms in  0 39 40 2000 to 3000 fathoms in  0 48 10 3000 to 4000 fathoms in  1 13 39 4000 to 5000 fathoms in  1 27 06 5000 to 6000 fathoms in  1 45 25

degree was 911 24m 458 The highest summits of the Himalaya Dha walagiri and Kinchinginga are little more than 28000 feet or 47 geographical miles above the sea The seabottom has therefore depths greatly exceeding the elevation of the highest pinnacle above its surface he strength of the line tried before the sounding was found to be equal to bear 721bs in air The 7706 fathoms which ran out weighed when dry 771bs exclusive of the plummet 91bs Great care was taken in the endeavour to bring the plummet again to the surface to show the nature of the bottom but whilst carefully reel ing in the line broke at 140 fathoms below the waterline carrying away a Sixs thermometer which had been bent on at 3000 fathoms A paper was also in part read entitled  On the Eclipses of Aga thocles Thales

By Francis Higginson Esq RN Communicated by Thomas Bell Esq Sec RS c Received December 23 1852 The writer states that his attention having been aroused by the highly electrical state of the atmosphere during a severe gale of wind he proceeded along the beach in the vicinity of Dover at 2 AM on the morning of Friday the 17th of December 1852 It had blown very hard during the night the wind veering from West to VWSW in occasional heavy squalls of rain and sleet accompanied at intervals by faint flashing scintillations which at277 first being considered sheet lightning were only noticed from their unusual colour a deep and sombre red At about 4h 50m AM how ever these flashes constantly emerging from a dense triangular and very remarkable cloud in the SE which perceptibly increased in size with great rapidity he was induced to observe it with minute attention At 411 55m AM Greenwich mean time the cloud had assumed the form of a rightangled triangle its hypothenuse or longest side tending east and west At this instant he first heard a singular and extraordinary hissing sound in the air not unlike that of a passing shot which although at first not very loud was yet clearly distinguishable above the howling of the gale At 5 AM the cloud had nearly doubled its original size advancing steadily from the SE in a NsW direction or from nearly dead to leeward to wards the winds eye whilst the scintillations spoken of were emitted with increased rapidity He also then first perceived in the centre of the cloud a dull red obscure nucleus or fireball appa rently about half the diameter of the moon having a tail five or six times that length from which the flashes mentioned were sent forth of surpassing brilliancy as the meteor clearly descended with great velocity through the air accompanied by a detonating hurtling hissing sound impossible to describe yet resembling that which precedes the shock of an earthquake At three minutes past five oclock AM the meteor having apparently spanned the Channel from SE to NW upon approaching the landevidently throw ing off portions of its substance as it passed through the atmo spherethe nucleus suddenly exploded with a report similar to a very heavy clap of thunder giving out an intensely brilliant light which rendered the minutest objects distinctly visible although it rained violently and the sky was obscured by dark and threatening clouds The dense body of the meteorite seemed to fall in the water about half a mile from the land as indicated by a great vo lume of spray which rose foaming in the distance February 3

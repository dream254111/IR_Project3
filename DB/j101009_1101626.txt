THE MURDER OF TIBERIUS GRACCHUS JONES SPOKEN OF IN THE RECORD AS GRAC JONES WAS FOUND GUILTY OF MURDER IN THE FIRST DEGREE AND SENTENCED TO BE ELECTRO CUTED TO THIS JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT A WRIT OF ERROR WAS AWARDED BY A JUDGE OF THIS COURT IT APPEARS THAT THE DECEASED IN COMPANY WITH HIS NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR ONE J H JOYNER RETURNED ON THE RAILROAD TRAIN FROM A TRIP TO SUFFOLK TO THE TOWN OF HOLLAND NEAR WHICH TOWN IN NANSEMOND COUNTY HE LIVED A LITTLE AFTER 9 OCLOCK P M OCTOBER 26 1908 AND AFTER LINGERING A SHORT TIME IN HOLLAND NEAR THE OFFICE OF A JUSTICE OF THE PEACE WHO WAS ENGAGED IN THE TRIAL OF A CRIMINAL CASE HE AND JOYNER LEFT FOR THEIR HOMES WALKING TO GETHER TILL THE PATHWAY OR ROAD TO JOYNERS HOME WAS REACHED AND THEN THE DECEASED PROCEEDED IN THE DIRECTION OF HIS OWN HOME NEARBY ABOUT 1030 OCLOCK P M JUST AFTER DECEASED HAD GOTTEN INSIDE HIS INCLOSURE ENTERING THROUGH WHAT IS GENERALLY SPOKEN OF AS THE EASTERN GATE HE WAS SHOT DOWN BY SOME PERSON OR PERSONS LYING IN WAIT RECEIVING TWO WOUNDS IN THE ABDOMEN MADE WITH NO 6 SHOT FIRED FROM A SHOTGUN AT SHORT RANGE AND THREE WOUNDS MADE BY BULLETS FIRED FROM A PISTOL THE SHOTS FROM BOTH THE GUN AND THE PISTOL WERE IN RAPID SUCCESSION AND THE WOUNDS FROM THE SHOTGUN WERE BOTH NECESSARILY FATAL AND FROM WHICH THE MURDERED MAN DIED WITHIN TWO OR THREE HOURS JOYNER WHO WAS NOT FAR AWAY AND WHO NOT ONLY HEARD THE SHOOTING BUT HEARD THE DECEASED EXCLAIM YOU SCOUNDREL WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO REACH THE DECEASED WHO EXCLAIMED AS HE AP PROACHED JOYNER THEY HAVE KILLED ME FOR TELLING THE TRUTH AND

LATER WHEN CONSCIOUS OF IMPENDING AND CERTAIN DEATH HE SAID THAT IT WAS SO DARK THAT HE COULD NOT SEE BUT THOUGHT IT WAS SAM HARDY THE PHYSICIANS ATTENDING THE WOUNDED MAN DID NOT FIND EITHER OF THE PISTOL BULLETS IN THE BODY OF THE DECEASED BUT DID FIND IN ONE OF THE WOUNDS THE WAD OF A CARTRIDGE WHICH BORE UPON IT THE STAMP OF THE UNION METALLIC CARTRIDGE COMPANY NO 6 SHOT 3 DRAMS POWDER JUST SUCH A WAD AS WAS USED IN SHELLS SHOT FROM A NO 12 BORE ITHACA SHOTGUN AND JUST SUCH A GUN AS SAM HARDY THE ACCUSED OWNED AND HAD IN HIS POSSESSION CERTAINLY UP TO A FEW DAYS BEFORE THIS MURDER THE PISTOL USED BY THE ASSAS SIN WAS AS NEAR AS COULD BE TOLD FROM THE WOUNDS IT MADE A 32 CALIBER JUST SUCH A PISTOL AS THE ACCUSED OWNED AND SHOWN TO HAVE BEEN PUT BY HIM INTO HIS POCKET ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER AS HE WAS LEAVING HIS STORE AND NOT OVER TWO HOURS BEFORE THE MURLER IT FURTHER APPEARS THAT THE ACCUSED AND THE DECEASED WHO HAD LIVED FOR SOME YEARS WITHIN LESS THAN A MILE OF EACH OTHER HAD BEEN FRIENDS UNTIL WITHIN A FEW MONTHS BEFORE THE MURDER OF THE DECEASED WHEN THEY BECAME EXCEEDINGLY UNFRIENDLY IN FACT BIT TERLY HOSTILE THE DECEASED HAVING CHARGED THE ACCUSED WITH SELLING LIQUOR WITHOUT A LICENSE AND OPENLY AND IN UNQUALIFIED TERMS CHARGED HIM WITH PERJURY IN THE TESTIMONY WHICH HE HAD GIVEN IN A WILL CASE JUST SIX DAYS PREVIOUS TO THE MURDER OF THE DECEASED AND THAT DECEASED HAD NOT ONLY DECLARED IT TO BE HIS PURPOSE TO PROSECUTE THE ACCUSED FOR THE ILLICIT SALE OF LIQUOR BUT ALSO FOR PERJURY AND HAD ON THE VERY DAY HE WAS ASSASSINATED GONE TO SUFFOLK TO CONSULT AN ATTORNEY WITH RESPECT TO THE INSTITUTION OF SUCH PROSECUTION IT ALSO APPEARS AS WE WILL SEE LATER THAT THE ACCUSED KNEW WHAT WERE THE DECLARATIONS AND PURPOSES OF THE DECEASED IN RESPECT TO HIS PROSECUTION FOR ILLICIT TRAFFIC IN LIQUOR BUT WHAT WAS VERY MUCH MORE SERIOUS TO HIM A PROSECUTION FOR PERJURY AND HE DOUBTLESS KNEW THAT THE CHARGE OF PERJURY COULD NOT BE MAINTAINED WITHOUT THE EVIDENCE OF THE DECEASED IT WAS FURTHERMORE SHOWN IN THE EVIDENCE THAT THE ACCUSED HARDY CHERISHED FEELINGS OF INTENSE HOSTILITY TOWARDS THE DE CEASED FOR SOME TIME PRIOR TO HIS DEATH AND THAT HE HAD MADE REPEATED AND MALIGNANT THREATS AGAINST HIS LIFE EARLY IN THE MORNING FOLLOWING THE MURDER THERE WAS FOUND NEAR WHERE THE DECEASED HAD FALLEN AND WAS LYING WHEN JOYNER FOUND HIM THE FOREARM OF AN ITHACA SHOTGUN WHICH HAD DOUBTLESS BOUNDED FROM THE GUN WHICH FIRED THE FATAL SHOTS AT THE DECEASEL A FOREARM OF JUST SUCH A SHOTGUN AS THE ACCUSED OWNEL TAKING UP IN THEIR ORDER THE ERRORS ASSIGNED ON BEHALF OF THE ACCUSED WE COME FIRST TO THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT THE TRIAL 2 1910 25716 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER COURT ERRED IN OVERRULING THE MOTION OF THE ACCUSED TO QUASH THE WRIT OF VENIRE FACIAS PURSUANT TO THE STATUTE SECTION 4018 CODE 1904 THE JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT COURT DIRECTED MORE THAN 20 NAMES TO BE DRAWN AND PLACED IN THE LIST AND MORE THAN 16 TO BE SUMMONEDI E THE ORDER ENTERED FOR GOOD CAUSE SHOWN DIRECTED THAT 40 PERSONS BE DRAWN AT LEAST 36 OF WHOM SHOULD BE SUMMONED THEREUPON THE CLERK ISSUED THE WRIT OF VENIRE FACIAS DIRECTING THE SHERIFF TO SUMMON THE ENTIRE 40 SO DRAWN AND THE FAILURE OF THE CLERK TO DIRECT THE SUMMONING OF 36 INSTEAD OF THE ENTIRE 40 IS THE GROUND OF THE MOTION OF THE ACCUSED TO QUASH THE WRIT THAT PART OF SECTION 4018 OF THE CODE SUPRA WHICH IS PERTINENT HERE IS AS FOLLOWS FOR GOOD CAUSE SHOWN IN ANY FELONY CASE OF THE JUDGE OF THE COURT IN TERM TIME OR VACATION MAY DIRECT MORE THAN TWENTY NAMES TO BE DRAWN AND PLACED IN THE LIST AND MORE THAN SIXTEEN PERSONS TO BE SUMMONED HE SHALL IN SUCH CASE SPECIFY THE NUMBER OF NAMES TO BE DRAWN AND THE NUMBER OF PERSONS TO BE SUMMONED THE NUMBER DRAWN SHALL NOT BE MORE THAN FOUR IN EXCESS OF THE NUMBER TO BE SUMMONED THAT THE CLERK IN THIS CASE PROCEEDED STRICTLY IN THE MANNER PRE SCRIBED IN THE STATUTE TO DRAW 40 NAMES FROM THE JURY BOX WHICH HE PLACED IN THE LIST WHICH HE DELIVERED TO THE SHERIFF IS NOT QUES TIONED THEREFORE THE SOLE QUESTION IS WAS THE ISSUING BY THE CLERK OF THE WRIT OF VENIRE FACIAS DIRECTING THE SHERIFF TO SUM MON THE ENTIRE LIST SO DRAWN SUCH A DEPARTURE FROM THE MANDA TORY AND IMPERATIVE REQUIREMENTS OF THE STATUTE AS PREJUDICED OR MIGHT HAVE BEEN PREJUDICIAL TO THE ACCUSED THE MOTION TO QUASH THE WRIT WAS MADE IN DUE TIME BUT IT IS NOWHERE POINTED OUT THAT THE ACCUSED WAS OR MIGHT HAVE BEEN PREJUDICED BY THE WRIT DIRECTING THE SUMMONING OF THE ENTIRE 40 INSTEAD OF ONLY 36 OF THE PERSONS NAMED IN THE LIST NOR DOES THERE OCCUR TO US ANY REASON FOR SUPPOSING THAT THIS IRREGULARITY OF THE CLERK IF INDEED IT COULD BE CONSIDERED AN IRREGULARITY COULD HAVE BY ANY POSSIBILITY BEEN PREJUDICIAL TO THE ACCUSED TO SUSTAIN THE CONTENTION OF THE ACCUSED THE CASES OF JONES V COMMONWEALTH 100 VA 842 41 S E 951 AND HOBACK V COM MONWEALTH 104 VA 871 52 S E 575 ARE GREATLY RELIED ON BUT IN OUR VIEW OF THOSE CASES THEY ARE NOT AUTHORITY FOR THE PROPO SITION THE ACCUSED IS CONTENDING FOR IN THE FIRST OF THOSE CASES THE CLERK ISSUED A WRIT OF VENIRE FACIAS COMMANDING THE OFFICER TO SUMMON 24 PERSONS OF HIS COUNTY INSTEAD OF 16 AS THE STATUTE AND THE ORDER OF THE COURT REQUIRED AND IT WAS HELD THAT THE MANDA TORY AND IMPERATIVE PROVISIONS OF THE STATUTE HAD NOT BEEN COM PLIED WITH AND THAT THE WRIT OF VENIRE FACIAS SHOULD HAVE BEEN QUASHED SUBSEQUENTLY THE STATUTE WAS AMENDED WITH THE EVI DENT INTENT OF REDUCING TECHNICAL OBJECTIONS IN CRIMINAL CASES TO THE MINIMUM SEE ACTS 190204 P 882 ACTS 1904 P 16 AUGUST 258HARDY V COMMONWEALTH IN THE HOBACK CASE SUPRA THE METHOD ACTUALLY FOLLOWED IN SUMMONING THE VENIRE WAS IN DIRECT CONTRAVENTION OF THE MANDA TORY PROVISIONS OF THE STATUTE FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE PRISONER AND A GUARANTY TO HIM OF A JURY UNINFLUENCED BY THE WILL CAPRICE OR PERSONAL PREFERENCE OF ANY OFFICER OF THE COURT THEREFORE THE SECOND AND THIRD AS WELL AS THE FIRST WRIT WERE QUASHED THAT CASE WAS WHOLLY DIFFERENT FROM THIS IT CANNOT BE CONTENDED WITH ANY DEGREE OF FORCE AS IT APPEARS TO US THAT BECAUSE THE SHERIFF IN THIS CASE WAS DIRECTED TO AND DID SUMMON THE ENTIRE PANEL OF 40 THE ACCUSED WAS DEPRIVED OF THE PRIVILEGE OF EXERCISING HIS OPTION OF STRIKING AS MANY AS FOUR FROM THE PANEL OR ANY ERROR COMMITTED OF WHICH HE COULD COMPLAIN WE CONCUR IN THE OPINION OF THE LEARNED JUDGE BELOW THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THE STATUTE REQUIRING THAT THE NUMBER OF PERSONS DRAWN FROM THE BOX SHOULD NOT BE MORE THAN FOUR IN EXCESS OF THE NUMBER SUMMONED WAS CLEARLY NOT INTENDED AS A PROTECTION TO THE PARTY TO BE TRIED BUT TO GIVE THE SHERIFF A CERTAIN DISCRE TION TO BE USED FOR HIS BENEFIT AND CONVENIENCE TO THE END THAT HE MIGHT BE EXCUSED IF HE DID NOT SUMMON ALL OF THE JURORS DRAWN PROVIDED THE NUMBER NOT SUMMONED WAS NOT GREATER THAN FOUR IN THE VERY NATURE OF THINGS THE MERE IRREGULARITY COM PLAINED OF IN THIS CASE DID NOT AND COULD NOT HAVE PREJUDICED THE ACCUSED AND THEREFORE THE REFUSAL OF THE TRIAL COURT TO QUASH THE WRIT OF VENIRE FACIAS IS WITHOUT ERROR THE SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR PRESENTS THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT ERRED IN PERMITTING OVER THE PROTEST AND OB JECTION OF THE ACCUSED THE TESTIMONY OF THE WITNESS J H JOYNER TO GO TO THE JURY THE ONLY GROUND UPON WHICH THE OBJECTION TO THE TESTIMONY OF THIS WITNESS COULD REST AT ALL IS THAT A PART OF IT RELATES TO MATTERS NOT COMMUNICATED TO THE ACCUSED BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION THIS WITNESS DID MAKE IMMATERIAL STATEMENTS BUT IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO US THAT ANY PART OF HIS TESTIMONY WAS IN A LEGAL SENSE PREJUDICIAL TO THE ACCUSED THE ACCUSED HAD MADE VICIOUS AND VIOLENT THREATS SHOWING UNMIS TAKABLY A DEADLY HOSTILITY ON HIS PART TOWARD THE DECEASED SOME OF WHICH THREATS WERE MORE OR LESS IMPERSONAL AND SOME OF THEM CONDITIONAL BUT ALL TENDING TO SHOW MALICE EITHER GEN ERAL OR SPECIAL TOWARD THE DECEASED ALL OF THESE THREATS TENDING TO SHOW ALSO THE INTENT OF HIS MIND TOWARDS THE DECEASED OR TOWARDS ANY ONE WHO WOULD DARE TO PROSECUTE HIM FOR A CRIM INAL VIOLATION OF THE LIQUOR LAWS AFTER HAVING CLAIMED TO BE HIS FRIEND SO AS TO CAUSE HIM TO LOSE A LARGE SUM OF MONEY AND THE TESTIMONY OF JOYNER WAS ENTIRELY PROPER AND MATERIAL TO PROVE THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE DECEASED TO PROSECUTE THE ACCUSED WAS COMMUNICATED TO THE ACCUSED BEFORE THE MURDER OF THE DE 1910 25916 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER CEASED JOYNER TESTIFIED THAT ON THE VERY DAY THIS MURDER WAS COMMITTED HE JOYNER HAD TOLD THE ACCUSED THAT MR JONES WAS GOING TO PROSECUTE HIM FOR SELLING LIQUOR WITHOUT A LICENSE THAT HE HAD AS WELL GET READY TO PAY THE FINE AND THAT HE HARDY HAD JUST AS WELL GET READY TO PAY A FINE FOR SELLING LIQUOR WITHOUT A LICENSE BECAUSE MR JONES HAD HIM FADED WHETHER ALL THE FACTS TESTIFIED TO BY JOYNER WERE COMMUNICATED TO THE ACCUSED OR NOT THEY WERE IN OUR OPINION FACTS WHICH WERE PROPER TO INTRODUCE INTO THE CASE FOR THE PURPOSE OF SHOW ING THE STATE OF FEELING EXISTING BETWEEN THE DECEASED AND THE ACCUSED AND OF SHOWING THE APPREHENSION OF THE ACCUSED THAT IT WAS THE SETTLED PURPOSE OF THE DECEASED TO HAVE HIM PROS ECUTED AND PUNISHED FOR BOTH THE ILLICIT SALE OF LIQUOR AND PER JURY THE THIRD ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR IS THE ADMISSION OF TESTIMONY OF THE WITNESSES JESSE COPELAND CLAUSE NORFLEET AND JOSEPH I JOHNSON WHO TESTIFIED TO CERTAIN THREATS MADE BY THE ACCUSED OF AN ALLEGED VAGUE INDEFINITE OR CONDITIONAL CHARACTER THE STATEMENT OF JOHNSON IS I HEARD HIM ACCUSED SAY THE DAY HE WENT HOME FROM HERE ON THE WILL CASE THAT HE WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM ON THAT DAY IF HE HAD OPENED HIS LIPS TO HIM HE DID NOT SAY MUCH ABOUT THE WILL HE CURSED AND QUARRELED OVER IT SOME AND SAID HE WAS GOING TO KILL GRAC JONES DAMN HIM COPELAND TESTIFIED THAT THE ACCUSED HAD SAID IN HIS PRES ENCE THAT IF A MRAN WAS TO REPORT HIM IN THIS LOW UNDERHAND MEANS OF PRETENDING TO BE FRIENDLY WITH HIM AND COME IN AND BUY WHISKY AND THEN GO OUT AND REPORT HIM AND GET HIM INTO COURT AND TROUBLE HE WOULD KILL HIM FOR IT THAT HE DID NOT MEAN ANY MAN THAT MIGHT REPORT HIM OR ANY MAN THAT WOULD BE A WITNESS BUT A PARTY THAT WOULD UNDERMININGLY AS HE CALLED IT BUY WHISKY FROM HIM IT IS TRUE THAT THE THREAT TESTIFIED TO BY COPELAND WAS A GEN ERAL THREAT AND IN A SENSE A CONDITIONAL THREAT AND WAS MADE SOME TIME BEFORE THIS MURDER BUT IT TENDED TO SHOW A PURPOSE IN THE MIND OF THE ACCUSED TO KILL ANY MAN WHO SHOULD SUBJECT HIM TO A PROSECUTION AND FINE FOR THE ILLICIT SALE OF LIQUOR AS WE HAVE SEEN THE DECEASED AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH AND PRIOR WAS ENGAGED IN PUTTING IN MOTION AGAINST THE ACCUSED THE MACHINERY OF THE LAW TO PUNISH HIM FOR SELLING LIQUOR WITHOUT A LICENSE AND THE ACCUSED HAD BEEN INFORMED A FEW HOURS BEFORE DECEASED MET HIS DEATH THAT HE DECEASED HAD THE EVIDENCE ON HIM THE ACCUSED AND WAS GOING TO PROSECUTE HIM THE AUTHORITIES SO FAR AS WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EXAMINE THEM UNMISTAKABLY HOLD THAT CONDITIONAL THREATS ARE ADMISSIBLE WHER EVER IT IS SHOWN THAT THE PARTY WHO HAS BEEN ATTACKED HAD PUT HIMSELF WITHIN THE CONDITIONS LAID DOWN BY THE PARTY MAKING THE THREATS 260 AUGUSTHARDY V COMMONWEALTH THE RULE AS TO ADMISSIBILITY OF SUCH EVIDENCE IS WELL STATED IN 21 CYC P 922 UNDER THE HEAD OF INDEFINITE IMPERSONAL AND CONDITIONAL THREATS AS FOLLOWS A THREAT TO KILL OR INJURE SOME ONE NOT DEFINITELY DESIGNATED IS ADMISSIBLE IN EVIDENCE WHERE OTHER FACTS ADDUCED GIVE INDIVIDUATION TO IT BUT GENERAL THREATS NOT SHOWN TO HAVE ALY REFERENCE TO THE DECEASEL CANNOT BE PROVED SO ALSO WORDS UTTERED UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES AS PRIMA FACIE TO IMPORT A THREAT ARE ADMISSIBLE THE FACT THAT THE THREAT MADE WAS CONDITIONAL OR WAS IMMEDIATELY RETRACTED DOES NOT AFFECT ITS ADMISSIBILITY NOR IS IT NECESSARY TO NAME THE THREATENED PARTY WHEN THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE DECEASED WAS THE PARTY INTENDED MATHIS V STATE 34 TEX CR R 39 28 S W 817 HARDY V STATE 31 TEX CR R 289 20 S W 561 CRIBBS V STATE 86 ALA 613 6 SOUTH 109 NORFLEETS TESTIMONY EXCEPTED TO WAS THAT A YEAR OR TWO BE FORE THE TRIAL THE ACCUSED IN WITNESS HEARING REMARKED THAT IF ANY ONE WAS TO INDICT HIM AND CAUSE HIM TO PAY OUT A WHOLE PARCEL OF MONEY HE WOULD KILL HIM WITH RESPECT TO THIS WIT NESS IT IS ONLY NECESSARY TO OBSERVE HERE THAT WITNESSES NOT UNFREQUENTLY OVERESTIMATE THE LAPSE OF TIME AND THE JURY MIGHT WELL HAVE CONSIDERED FROM ALL THE EVIDENCE IN THE CASE THAT THIS REMARK OF THE ACCUSED IN THE PRESENCE OF NORFLEET WAS NOT ANY THING LIKE TWO YEARS OR EVEN A YEAR BEFORE THE MURDER OF THE DECEASED THE TESTIMONY OF THIS WITNESS WAS ENTIRELY COMPE TENT TO SHOW THE ILL FEELING EXISTING BETWEEN THE DECEASED AND THE ACCUSED FOR SOME TIME PERHAPS A YEAR PRIOR TO THE MURDER OF THE DECEASED JOSEPH I JOHNSON TESTIFIED THAT ABOUT A WEEK BEFORE THE KILLING OF THE DECEASED HE HEARD THE ACCUSED SAY ALL RIGHT IF THINGS TURNED OUT LIKE THEY LOOKED HE WAS GOING TO KILL HIM DAMN HIM NOW BOTH JOYNER AND JOHNSON CLEARLY APPEAR TO BE RELUCTANT WITNESSES AGAINST THE ACCUSED AND THOUGH JOHNSON SAID THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHOM THE ACCUSED WAS TALKING ABOUT WHETHER A MAN OR A SNAKE OR A MULE OR WHO IT WAS WITHIN THE PROVINCE OF THE JURY TO DETERMINE THE FACTS AND TO DRAW REASONABLE INFERENCES THEREFROM AND IT IS PERFECTLY EVIDENT THAT THE JURY UNDERSTOOD FROM THE LANGUAGE OF THE ACCUSED TESTIFIED TO BY JOHNSON THAT HE REFERRED TO SOME MAN AND WERE WAR RANTED FROM ALL THE EVIDENCE ADDUCED IN THE CONCLUSION THAT HE REFERRED TO HIS AVOWED ENEMY THE DECEASED R W WITHERS ON BEHALF OF THE COMMONWEALTH TESTIFIED THAT ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE MURDER OF THE DECEASED WHICH OCCURRED AS STATED BETWEEN 10 AND 11 OCLOCK P M DECEASED CAME TO SUFFOLK AND INQUIRED OF WITNESS WHY HE DID NOT PROCEED TO PROSECUTE THE ACCUSED HARDY FOR SELLING LIQUORS WITHOUT A LICENSE AND FOR PERJURY CLAIMED BY THE DECEASED TO HAVE BEEN 1910 26116 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER COMMITTED BY THE ACCUSED IN HIS TESTIMONY WITH REFERENCE TO THE WILL OF Z T HOLLAND WHICH TESTIMONY OF THE ACCUSED HAD BEEN TAKEN BEFORE A NOTARY SOME FIVE OR SIX DAYS PRIOR TO THIS CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE WITNESS WITHERS AND THE DECEASED WITHERS TESTIFIED TO NO THREAT MADE BY THE DECEASED BUT ONLY TO THE EFFECT THAT THE DECEASED ENTERTAINED FEELINGS OF REVENGE AND ILL WILL TOWARDS THE ACCUSED THE WITNESS ALSO TESTIFIED IN RESPECT TO FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE MURDER TENDING TO SHOW THE ANIMUS OF THE DECEASED TOWARDS THE ACCUSED AND IT MAY BE THAT IF THERE HAD BEEN NO OTHER EVI LENCE IN CONNECTION WITH THE STATEMENTS OF THE WITNESS BRINGING HOME TO THE ACCUSED KNOWLEDGE OF THE DECEASEDS FEELINGS TO WARDS HIM THERE WOULD BE FORCE IN THE POSITION THAT THIS EVI LENCE OF WITHERS WAS INADMISSIBLE BUT IT IS TO BE BORNE IN MIND THAT THE ACCUSED WAS TOLD BY JOYNER ON THE VERY CLAY

ANYTHING HE COULD HEAR HIM GRAC JONES SAY IN A LOW TONE THAT IS A LIE THE TESTIMONY OF WITHERS TO A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT IS NOT VERY MATERIAL BUT WAS NOT INCOMPETENT WHILE THE OTHER FACTS HE TESTIFIED

WHERE NO HUMAN EYE NOT EVEN THE UNFORTUNATE VICTIM COULD SEE THE HIDDEN FOE AND OF NECESSITY FROM THE VERY NATURE OF THE CASE THE CRIME CAN ONLY BE PROVED BY CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVI DENCE IF THIS WERE NOT A CORRECT AND AN ESTABLISHED RULE OF EVIDENCE MANY OF THE MOST ATROCIOUS CRIMES KNOWN TO SOCIETY WOULD GO UNPUNISHED AND SOCIETY BE ILLY PROTECTED ESPECIALLY AGAINST SUCH SHOCKING AND DASTARDLY MURDERS AS WE ARE NOW LEALING WITH THE FACTS PROVEN IN THIS ARE THAT BITTER FEELINGS EXISTED BETWEEN THE ACCUSED AND THE LECEASED THAT DECEASED JUST PRIOR TO HIS DEATH HAD BEEN TALKING FREELY ABOUT THE ACCUSED ON THE STREETS OF HOLLAND AND ELSEWHERE HE DID NOT PICK HIS MEN TO TALK TO ABOUT ACCUSED BUT TALKED OPEN AND ABOVE BOARD AND THAT TOO IN A SMALL TOWN WHERE THE ACCUSED WAS A PROMI NENT BUSINESS MAN THE ACCUSED HAD JUST TESTIFIED IN THE WILL CASE AT WHICH TIME THE DECEASED WAS SITTING BEHIND OPPOSING COUNSEL PROMPTING HIM AS TO THE LINE OF ATTACK AND WAS HEARD BY THE ACCUSED FREQUENTLY TO SAY IN AN UNDERTONE THATS A LIE WHEN THE ACCUSED WAS TESTIFYING THAT THE ACCUSED HAD ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS STATED THAT ANY PERSON WHO HAD ONCE BEEN HIS FRIEND AND AFTERWARDS TURNED AGAINST HIM INFORMING ON HIM FOR SELLING LIQUORS WITHOUT A LICENSE HE WOULD KILL THAT HE KNEW THAT THE DECEASED WAS INFORMING ON HIM BOTH AS TO THE SELLING OF LIQUOR AND AS TO THE STILL GRAVER CHARGE OF PERJURY THAT THE ACCUSED HAL SAID TO SEVERAL PEOPLE JUST PRIOR TO THE KILLING OF THE DECEASED THAT HE WAS GOING TO KILL GRAC JONES DAMN HIM THAT IF JONES CAME IN HIS STORE HE WOULD KILL HIM THAT HE WOULD GIVE 50 TO HAVE JONES ALONE IN THE DIS MAL SWAMP AND WORK NIGHTS TO MAKE THE MONEY THAT JONES 1910 26316 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER HAD SPOKEN TO HIM AT CHURCH WHERE HE HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF HIM BUT HIS ACCUSEDS TIME WAS COMING WITH THESE FACTS PROVEN BY UNCONTRADICTED EVIDENCE IT IS CLEAR TO US THAT THE STATEMENTS OF COPELAND NORFLEET JOHNSON AND WITHERS WERE PROPERLY ALLOWED TO GO TO THE JURY

THE LEARNED COUNSEL FOR THE ACCUSED IN THIS CASE SEEM TO CON TEND FOR THE VIEW THAT EVIDENCE AS TO THE STATE OF FEELING EXISTING BETWEEN THE ACCUSED AND THE VICTIM OF A MURDLER CAN ONLY BE ADMITTED AFTER IT IS SHOWN THAT THE ACCUSED COMMITTED THE CRIME BUT THE AUTHORITIES BY NO MEANS SUSTAIN THIS VIEW A CASE IN POINT IS KEENER V STATE 18 GA 228 63 AM DEC 269 WHERE THE COURT SAID THE TRUE DISTINCTION WE APPREHEND AS TO THE ADMISSIBILITY OF EVIDENCE OF THREATS AND ONE APPARENTLY OVERLOOKED IN MANY OF THE CASES IS THIS WHEN SOUGHT TO BE INTRODUCED BY THE DEFENDANT AS A JUSTIFICATION FOR THE HOMICIDE AND WITHOUT ANY OVERT ACT HE MUST SHOW THAT THEY HAVE BEEN COMMUNICATED OTHERWISE THEY CAN FURNISH NO EXCUSE FOR HIS CONDUCT BUT WHEN OFFERED TO PROVE A SUBSTANTIAL FACT VIZ THE STATE OF FEELING ENTERTAINED BY DECEASED TOWARD THE ACCUSED IT IS COMPETENT TESTIMONY WHETHER A KNOWLEDGE OF THE THREATS BE BROUGHT HOME TO THE DEFENDANT OR NOT WHEN THE FACT OF HOM ICIDE IS ADMITTED OR ESTABLISLLED BY THE EVIDENCE CIRCUMSTANCES SHOWING THE TEMPER AND CONDUCT OF THE PARTIES AND ILLUSTRATING THEIR FEELINGS TOWARDS EACH OTHER PREVIOUS TO THE FATAL MEETING ARE ADMISSIBLE IN EVIDENCE AS TENDING TO THROW LIGHT ON THE QUES TION OF MALICE AND INTENT 21 CYC 892 DEANS CASE 32 GRAT 912 THE SAME PRINCIPLE IS RECOGNIZED BV THIS COURT IN OBOYLES CASE 100 VA 785 40 S E 121 WHERE THE OPINION BY KEITH P SAYS THE EVIDENCE OBJECTED TO WAS NOT ADMITTED AS TEND ING TO PROVE THE PERPETRATION OF THE CRIME WITH WHICH THE PRIS ONER WAS CHARGED BUT FOR THE PURPOSE OF SHOWING THE RELATION BETWEEN THE PARTIES THEIR STATE OF FEELINGS AND COURSE OF CON DUCT TOWARDS EACH OTHER AND AS REFLECTING LIGHT UPON THE MOTIVE AND INTENT WITH WHICH THE ACT WAS DONE TO REVIEW HERE THE NUMEROUS AUTHORITIES CITED BY THE LEARNED COUNSEL FOR THE ACCUSED WOULD NEEDLESSLY PROLONG THIS OPINION AUGUST 264HARDY V COMMONWEALTH SINCE OUR EXAMINATION OF THEM LEADS EITHER TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THEY DO NOT SUSTAIN THE VIEW CONTENDED FOR OR ARE IN CONFLICT WITH THE GREAT WEIGHT OF AUTHORITY AND THEREFORE COULD NOT BE GIVEN OUR APPROVAL EXCEPTION IS TAKEN TO THE TESTIMONY OF THE WITNESS C E EVERETT WHO WAS A LETECTIVE OF NORFOLK VA AND TESTIFIED THAT A SHORT WHILE BEFORE THIS MURDER HE WAS EMPLOYED BY THE DE CEASEL JONES TO GO TO THE TOWN OF HOLLAND FOR THE PURPOSE OF GETTING UP EVIDENCE WITH THE VIEW OF PROSECUTING THE ACCUSED HARDY FOR SELLING LIQUOR ILLEGALLY THE GROUND OF OBJECTION TO THIS EVIDENCE IS THAT THE VISITS OF EVERETT AND HIS EFFORTS TO GET UP EVIDENCE WANTED BY THE DECEASED WERE NOT KNOWN TO THE ACCUSEL AND THEREFORE COULD NOT HAVE PROMPTED A MOTIVE IN HIM TO COMMIT THE CRIME WITH WHICH HE STOOD CHARGED IN ANSWER TO THIS EXCEPTION WE DEEM IT ONLY NECESSARY TO SAY THAT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO PERCEIVE HOW THE EVIDENCE OF EVERETT COULD HAVE DONE MORE THAN PRODUCE UPON THE MINDS OF THE JURY THE IMPRESSION THAT THE DECEASED ENTERTAINED INTENSELY BITTER AND REVENGEFUL FEELING TOWARDS THE ACCUSED THERE IS NOTHING WHATEVER IN THE EVIDENCE GIVEN BY THE WITNESS WHICH INDICATED OR EVEN SUGGESTED TO THE JURY THAT THE ACCUSED WAS GUILTY OF THE CHARGE FOR WHICH HE WAS THEN BEING TRIED ON THE CONTRARY IF THE EVIDENCE OF THE WITNESS MADE ANY IMPRESSION ON THE JURY IT MUST HAVE BEEN FAVORABLE TO THE ACCUSED FOR THE REASON THAT THE WITNESS STATED THAT HE FOUND IN HIS INVESTIGATION NO EVIDENCE OF GUILT AGAINST THE ACCUSED AND THE JURY WERE TOLD THAT THIS EVIDENCE WAS ADMITTED FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF SHOWING THE FEELINGS BETWEEN THE DECEASED AND THE ACCUSED THE AUTHORITIES WE HAVE CITED ABUNDANTLY SUSTAIN THE RULING OF THE TRIAL COURT IN ADMITTING THE EVIDENCE OF THIS WITNESS ANOTHER ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR IS THE ADMISSION OF THE TESTIMONY OF WITNESS P S LIVERMORE TREASURER OF THE ITHACA GUN COM PANY TO PROVE AN ORIGINAL ENTRY UPON THE REGULARLY KEPT BOOKS OF THAT COMPANY THE WITNESS PROVED THAT THE SALES BOOK OF THE ITHACA GUN COMPANY PRODUCED AT THE TRIAL SHOWING THE RECORDS OF SHIPMENTS MADE BY THAT COMPANY FROM THE 30TH DAY OF OCTOBER 1906 TO THE 18TH DAY OF SEPTEMBER 1907 WAS A BOOK CONTAINING ORIGINAL ENTRIES IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS PROVED THAT THE SALES BOOK WAS IN FACT ONE OF THE BOOKS REGULARLY KEPT BY THE ITHACA GUN COMPANY AND USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING JUST SUCH ENTRIES AND RECORDS AS APPEARED THEREIN VERY TRUE THE BOOKKEEPER WHO MADE THE ENTRY PROVED IN THIS CASE DID NOT TESTIFY ON THE TRIAL BUT IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT THE BOOKKEEPERS AT TENDANCE COULD NOT BE ENFORCED AS HE WAS BEYOND THE JURIS DICTION OF THE TRIAL COURT THE BOOK PRODUCED IN THIS INSTANCE WAS CERTAINLY A BOOK OF EQUAL AUTHENTICITY WITH AN ORDINARY BOOK 1910 26516 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER OF ACCOUNTS ANL THIS COURT HELD AS FAR BACK AS THE CASES OF DOWNER V MORRISON 2 GRAT 250 AND HAMPTON ETC V MICHAEL 6 GRAT 151 THAT COPIES OF ORIGINAL ENTRIES ON PLAINTIFFS BOOKS WERE COMPETENT EVIDENCE TO SHOW TO WHOM GOODS WERE SOLD HERE NOT A COPY OF THE ENTRY BUT THE ORIGINAL BOOK OF ENTRY WAS PRODUCED AND AUTHENTICATED BY AN OFFICER OF THE COMPANY THE CASE OF VINAL V GILMAN 21 W VA 301 45 AM REP 562 IS DIRECTLY IN POINT IN WHICH IT WAS HELD THAT A BOOK OF ORIGINAL ENTRIES IN WHICH AN ENTRY IS MADE IN THE USUAL COURSE OF BUSINESS AT THE TIME OF THE TRANSACTION OF MATTERS WITHIN THE PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE BOOKKEEPER IS ADMISSIBLE IF THE BOOKKEEPER BE DEAD AT THE TIME OF TRIAL OR BE A NONRESIDENT OR CANNOT BE PRODUCED AS A WITNESS ON ACCOUNT OF INSANITY OR OTHER CAUSE WE ARE OF OPINION THAT THE TESTIMONY GIVEN BY LIVERMORE TO THE EFFECT THAT THE ITHACA GUN COMPANY SOLD AND SHIPPED TO THE LEONARD HARDWARE COMPANY ON JUNE 29 1907 A CERTAIN LOT OF GUNS AMONG WHICH WAS A GUN HAVING UPON ITS FOREARM THE SAME NUMBER AS ON THE FOREARM OF AN ITHACA GUN PICKED UP NEAR WHERE THE VICTIM OF THIS MURDER WAS FOUND LYING WAS PROPERLY ADMITTED IN EVIDENCE AS TENDING TO PROVE A FACT TO BE CONSIDERED BY THE JURY ALONG WITH THE OTHER FACTS AND CIRCUM STANCES WHICH THE EVIDENCE ADDUCED TENDING TO PROVE VIZ THAT ONE OF THESE GUNS WAS AFTERWARDS OWNED BY THE ACCUSED AND WAS IN HIS POSSESSION SHORTLY BEFORE THIS MURDER IN THE COURSE OF THE TRIAL J U BURGES WAS PERMITTED TO TES TIFY AS TO INCONSISTENT STATEMENTS OF ONE EVERETT HOLLAND A WIT NESS CALLED FOR THE COMMONWEALTH AND TO DISCREDIT THE TESTIMONY OF THAT WITNESS THIS RULING OF THE TRIAL COURT IS ASSIGNED AS ERROR IT CLEARLY APPEARS IN THE RECORD THAT THE COURSE OF PROCEDURE ADOPTED BY THE ATTORNEY FOR THE COMMONWEALTH IN RESPECT TO THE SUMMONING EXAMINATION AND IMPEACHMENT OF THE WITNESS EVERETT HOLLAND CONFORMED TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 3351 CODE 1904 AND HAS THE APPROVAL OF THIS COURT IN MCCUES CASE 103 VA 870 49 S E 623 HERE BOTH OF THE CONDITIONS UPON WHICH THE CONTRADICTION AND IMPEACHMENT OF A WITNESS BY THE PARTY WHO CALLED HIM IS PERMISSIBLE WERE SHOWN TO EXIST THE WITNESS HOLLAND TURNED OUT TO BE ADVERSE TO THE COMMONWEALTH AND THE ATTORNEY FOR THE COMMONWEALTH WAS SURPRISED BY THE EVIDENCE HE GAVE IN AS WAS STATED BY MR BURGES IN THIS CON NECTION THE COURT PROPERLY INSTRUCTED THE JURY THAT THE EVIDENCE OF EVERETT HOLLAND SO FAR AS IT CONTRADICTED ANY STATEMENT OF ANY WITNESS INTRODUCED BY THE DEFENSE WAS PROPER REBUTTAL AND SO FAR AS IT SHOWED HE HAD MADE DIFFERENT STATEMENTS TO MR BURGES IT CAN ONLY GO TO HIS HOLLANDS CREDIBILITY AND AFFECT 266 AUGUSTHARDY V COMMONWEALTH HIS VERACITY AND TRUTHFULNESS THIS THE ACCUSEDS SEVENTH AS SIGNMENT OF ERROR IS ALSO WITHOUT MERIT THE EIGHTH ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR RELATES TO THE REFUSAL OF THE COURT TO SET ASIDE THE VERDICT OF THE JURY BECAUSE THE JURY HAD BEEN PERMITTED BY THE OFFICERS OF THE COURT DURING THE TRIAL TO AT TEND A MOVING PICTURE SHOW IT APPEARS THAT THE JURY IN COMPANY WITH TWO DEPUTY SHERIFFS ON TWO NIGHTS DURING THE TRIAL WERE ALLOWED TO GO IN A BODY AND OCCUPY ONE OF THE GALLERIES OF A ROOM IN WHICH THE MOVING PIC TURES WERE EXHIBITED THAT THIS GALLERY WAS USED EXCLUSIVELY BY THE JURY AND THE DEPUTIES AND THAT NO PERSON COMMUNICATED WITH THEM WHILE IN ATTENDANCE UPON THE SHOW NOR IS IT CONTENDED THAT ANY WRONG WAS PURPOSELY COMMITTED BY ANY ONE CONNECTED WITH THE VISIT TO THIS ENTERTAINMENT BUT IT SEEMS TO BE CONCEDED THAT ALL WERE ACTING IN THE BEST OF FAITH IT IS CONTENDED HOWEVER BY COUNSEL FOR THE ACCUSED THAT AS THE PICTURES EXHIBITED AT THE SHOW WERE A REPRODUCTION OF A TRAG EDY CALLED VENGEANCE IN NORMANDY WHEREIN TWO SUITORS FOR THE HAND OF A LADY QUARRELED AND ONE OF THEM LAY IN WAIT ALONG A ROAD NEAR THE HOME OF THE LADY ATTACKED HIS RIVAL WITH A DAGGER AND FELLED HIM TO THE GROUND THE ATTACK HOWEVER NOT PROVING FATAL THIS EXHIBITION WAS CALCULATED TO INFLUENCE AND INFLAME THE MINDS OF THE JURY BY REASON OF ITS SIMILARITY TO THE CASE WHICH THEY WERE TRYING AND THAT THE SCENES ON THE CANVAS WERE CAL CULATED TO UNDULY IMPRESS THEM WITH THE HORROR OF THE CRIME AND TO PREJUDICE THEIR MINDS UNCONSCIOUSLY IT MIGHT BE AGAINST THE ACCUSED WE FAIL TO APPRECIATE THE SIMILARITY OF THE EXHIBITION WIT NESSED BY THE JURY TO THE CASE THEY WERE TRYING BUT DO RECOGNIZE THE INDISCRETION ON THE PART OF THE OFFICERS OF THE COURT IN CHARGE OF THE JURY AND THEIR CONDUCT IS HIGHLY CENSURABLE THE QUESTION HOWEVER TO BE DETERMINED HERE IS HAS THE ACCUSED BEEN PREJU DICED BY THE MISCONDUCT OF THE OFFICERS IN PERMITTING AND OF THE JURY IN ATTENDING THE PICTURE SHOW OF WHICH HE ONLY COMPLAINED AFTER THE JURY HAD RENDERED THEIR VERDICT ALTHOUGH HE KNEW BE FORE THE CONCLUSION OF THE TRIAL THAT THE JURY HAD BEEN ATTENDING THE SHOW AS ALREADY STATED THERE WAS NO COMMUNICATION MADE TO THE JURY BEARING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY UPON THE ISSUE OF THE GUILT OR INNOCENCE OF THE ACCUSED AND WE HAVE SEARCHED IN VAIN THE RECORD FOR A FACT OR CIRCUMSTANCE IN THIS CONNECTION PREJUDI CIAL TO THE ACCUSED THE FACT THAT THE JURY SAW A PICTURE OF A SOMEWHAT TRAGIC CHARACTER FALLS FAR SHORT OF REASONABLE GROUND OF OBJECTION TO THEIR VERDICT NOWHERE IN THE RECORD DOES IF APPEAR THAT ANY MEMBER OF THE JURY WERE INFLUENCED OR AFFECTED IN ANY WAY OR COULD BY POSSIBILITY HAVE BEEN INFLUENCED OR AFFECTED BY SEEING THE PICTURE SHOW ON THE CONTRARY THE POSITIVE AND UN 1910 26716 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER CONTRADICTED PROOF TAKEN AFTER THE TRIAL HAD ENDED DEMONSTRATES NOT ONLY THAT NO MEMBER OF THE JURY WAS DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY PREJUDICED AGAINST THE ACCUSED BY SEEING THE PICTURE REFERRED TO BUT THAT NOT THE SLIGHTEST IMPRESSION AFFECTING THE CASE WHICH THEY WERE TO TRY WAS MADE OR COULD HAVE BEEN MADE BY ANYTHING THAT APPEARED UPON THE PICTURE THE FOREGOING FACTS AS TO THE JURY NOT HAVING BEEN COMMUNI CATED WITH OR AFFECTED IN ANY WAY PREJUDICIAL TO THE ACCUSED BY THEIR ATTENDANCE UPON THE PICTURE SHOW ARE BORNE OUT BY THE AFFIDA VITS OF THE DEPUTY SLHERIFFS WHO HAD CHARGE OF THE JURY AND BY EACH MEMBER OF THE JURY THEMSELVES READ TO AND CONSIDERED BY THE COURT ON THE MOTION TO SET ASIDE THE VERDICT BECAUSE THE JURY HAD ATTENDED THE PICTURE SHOW NO CASE CAN BE FOUND WE BELIEVE WHERE IT IS HELD THAT A VERDICT OF A JURY SHOULD BE SET ASIDE UPON THE FACTS SHOWN IN THIS CASE TOUCHING THE ATTENDANCE OF THE JURY OF THE PICTURE EXHIBITION OF COURSE AS THE AUTHORITIES HOLD WHERE THE JURY OR SOME MEMBER OF IT WAS IN SOME WAY SUBJECTED TO INFLUENCE WHICH WOULD BE CALCULATED TO INFLUENCE THEM IN COMING TO A VERDICT THE VERDICT SHOULD BE SET ASIDE BUT THE MERE SIGHT OR HEARING OF THINGS WHICH WERE HARMLESS AND INNOCENT AND WHICH HAD NO CONNECTION WITH THE CASE THEY WERE TRYING AND COULD HAVE NO BEARING OR INFLUENCE UPON THEIR VERDICT WILL NOT SERVE TO INVALIDATE THEIR VERDICT THIS VIEW IS SANCTIONED BY THOMPSONS CASE 8 GRAT 637 TRIMS CASE 18 GRAT 983 98 AM DEC 765 AND KENNEDYS CASE 2 VA CAS 510 AND IT ALSO HAS SANCTION IN MCCUES CASE SUPRA WHERE IT WAS HELD THAT THE READING OF THE DAILY NEWSPAPERS IN WHICH FULL ACCOUNTS WERE GIVEN OF THE TRIAL WITH SENSATIONAL HEADLINES WHICH COULD HARDLY ESCAPE THE ATTENTION OF THE READER EVEN THOUGH HE FAITHFULLY ENDEAVORED TO AVOID ALL PARTS OF THE NEWSPAPER WHICH REFERRED TO THE TRIAL WAS NOT SUFFICIENT GROUND TO INVALIDATE THE VERDICT OF SUCH JURY ESPECIALLY WHEN THE COUNSEL FOR THE ACCUSED KNEW AT THE TIME THAT THE JURY WERE SO READING SUCH NEWSPAPERS AND MADE NO OBJECTION UNTIL AFTER THEIR VER DICT WAS RENDERED SEE ALSO THOMPSON  MERRIAM ON JURIES PP 413 415 IN THIS CASE IT IS CONCLUSIVELY SHOWN BY THE EVIDENCE TAKEN AFTER THE TRIAL THAT COUNSEL FOR THE ACCUSED KNEW THAT THE JURY ATTENDED THE MOVING PICTURE SHOW BEFORE THE CASE HAD BEEN SUBMITTED TO THEM FOR THEIR VERDICT AND THAT WITH KNOWLEDGE OF THIS FACT THEY REMAINED QUIET AND RAISED NO OBJECTION TO THE ACTION OF THE JURY IN THIS BEHALF TAKING THEIR CHANCES OF A FAVOR ABLE VERDICT AND RAISED THIS QUESTION ONLY AFTER THE JURY HAD RENDERED A VERDICT AGAINST THE ACCUSED A PARTY CANNOT GO FORWARD WITH A TRIAL AND TAKE HIS CHANCES OF SUCCESS AND AFTER THE CASE HAS GONE AGAINST HIM SEEK A NEW 268 AUGUSTHARDY V COMMONWEALTH TRIAL UPON SOME ACT OF THE JURY KNOWN TO HIM BEFORE THE CASE WAS SUBMITTED TO THEM AND WHICH HE AFTERWARDS CLAIMED TO BE MISCONDUCT A  D RY CO V PEAKE 87 VA 130 12 S E 348 WILLIAMS CASE 93 VA 769 25 S E 659 MCCUES CASE SUPRA SEE ALSO STATE V BALLEW 83 S C 82 63 S E 688 WE ARE NOW BROUGHT TO THE REMAINING ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR WHICH PRESENTS THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT THE TRIAL COURT SHOULD HAVE SET ASIDE THE VERDICT BECAUSE CONTRARY TO THE LAW AND THE EVIDENCE THE LAW OF THE CASE WAS PROPOUNDED TO THE JURY IN A SERIES OF INSTRUCTIONS TO NONE OF WHICH DID THE ACCUSED TAKE EXCEPTION AND MANY OF THE MATERIAL FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES PROVEN AT THE TRIAL HAVE BEEN ALREADY ADVERTED TO IN CONNECTION WITH OTHER QUESTIONS DISPOSED OF IN THIS OPINION AND NEED NOT BE HERE RE PEATED AT THE OUTSET WE MAY SAY THAT THE EVIDENCE VERY CONCLUSIVELY SHOWS 1 THAT THE ACCUSED HAD NOT ONLY A GRUDGE AGAINST THE DECEASED BUT BORE TOWARD HIM A FEELING OF REVENGE AND 2 THAT HE HELD HUMAN LIFE CHEAP AND WAS A MAN WHOSE FIRST THOUGHT WAS TO KILL THE MAN AGAINST WHOM HE FELT A GRIEVANCE THE THREATS HE MADE AGAINST THE ACCUSED WHICH WE HAVE NARRATED THE FINDING ON THE SCENE OF THIS HORRIBLE TRAGEDY OF THE FOREARM OF AN ITHACA GUN SUCH AS WAS OWNED BY HIM AND IN HIS POSSESSION UP TO THE DATE OF THIS MURDER SO FAR AS THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THE PUTTING INTO HIS POCKET OF A PISTOL ANSWERING IN CHARACTER AND CALIBER TO THE CHARACTER AND CALIBER OF THE PISTOL FROM WHICH THE BULLETS ENTERING THE BODY OF HIS VICTIM MIGHT HAVE BEEN FIRED AND THE WAD FOUND IN DECEASEDS BODY OF THE SIZE USED IN THE GUN HE OWNED AND THE STAMP AS TO CONTENTS ANSWERING TO THE CLASS OF CARTRIDGES HE ALONE KEPT ON SALE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD TOLD AN AWFUL AND DAMNING STORY AGAINST THE ACCUSED ENTWINING ALONG WITH THE OTHER FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES TESTIFIED TO AROUND HIM SUCH A NETWORK OF INCRIMINATING CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HE DID NOT AND COULD NOT EXTRICATE HIMSELF HE ATTEMPTED TO PROVE BY A A HOLLAND AND HIS WIFE AT WHOSE HOUSE HE HAD LIVED ON THE MOST INTIMATE TERMS AND RE LATIONSHIP FOR YEARS AND BY A SOJOURNER AT THAT HOUSE FOR SOME MONTHS AN ALIBI BUT WITH RESPECT TO THIS TESTIMONY WE FORBEAR TO SAY MORE THAN THAT A CAREFUL READING OF IT LEADS IRRESISTABLY TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE JURY WERE WELL WARRANTED IN WHOLLY DISREGARDING IT AS DOUBTLESS THEY DID A WEAK AND ABSOLUTELY FUTILE ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO PROVE THAT THE ACCUSED HAD PARTED WITH THE ITHACA GUN TRACED TO HIS OWNER SHIP SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE THE 26TH DAY OF OCTOBER 1908 AND THE ONE WITNESS TESTIFYING IN THIS CONNECTION NOT ONLY COULD NOT GIVE THE NAME OF THE BUYER BUT TOLD SUCH A FLIMSY AND IMPROBABLE 1910 26916 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER STORY THAT THE JURY COULD NOT HAVE GIVEN THE LEAST CREDENCE TO IT TO THE FINDING OF THE FOREARM OF AN ITHACA GUN BEARING THE NUM BER 140444 DROPPED BY ACCIDENT BY THE ASSASSIN AT THE SCENE OF THIS CRIME IS ADDED THE PROOF OF THE INCRIMINATING CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THIS SAME FOREARM OF THE GUN HAD BOUNDED OR DROPPED OFF THE GUN WHEN USED BY ITS OWNER FROM WHOM THE ACCUSED AC QUIRED IT THAT THE FORMER OWNER WHILE OUT HUNTING WITH THIS GUN BUT A SHORT WHILE BEFORE THE ACCUSED BECAME ITS OWNER SAID TO HIS COMPANION THAT A PIECE OF HIS GUN WAS GONE AND UPON THE SUGGESTION OF THIS COMPANION SEARCH WAS MADE WHERE THE GUN WAS LAST FIRED AND THERE THE MISSING FOREARM WAS FOUND BY AN UNBROKEN CHAIN OF CIRCUMSTANCES AN ITHACA GUN BEARING UPON ITS FOREARM THE NUMBER 140444 WAS SUBSTANTIALLY AND FAIRLY TRACED FROM THE MANUFACTURERS OF THE GUN AT ITHACA N Y TO A FIRM IN PETERSBURG VA FROM THAT FIRM IN OCTOBER 1907 TO HOLLAND  HARDY WHO BOUGHT IT FOR HOLLAND FROM HOLLAND TO SAMUEL HARDY THE ACCUSED AND FROM THE ACCUSED TO THE SPOT WHERE THE DECEASED THE OBJECT OF THE ACCUSEDS VENOM AND MALICE RECEIVED HIS DEATH WOUNDS AND FROM JUST SUCH A GUN LOADED WITH JUST SUCH CARTRIDGES AS THAT GUN CARRIED AND JUST SUCH AS THE ACCUSED HAD A SUPPLY OF AGAIN THE ACCUSED SOUGHT TO BREAK THE FORCE OF THE CIRCUM STANTIAL EVIDENCE UNMISTAKABLY POINTING TO HIM AS THE PERSON GUILTY OF THE FOUL MURDER OF THE DECEASED BY INTRODUCING TESTI MONY TO SHOW THAT A NEGRO MAN BY THE NAME OF GEORGE WIGGINS HAD MADE SOME SORT OF A VAGUE AND INDEFINITE THREAT AGAINST THE ACCUSED OR HIS FAMILY BUT IN ADDITION TO THIS TESTIMONY DEVELOP ING NOTHING WORTHY OF THE CONSIDERATION OF THE JURY WIGGINS TESTIFIED FOR THE COMMONWEALTH AT THE TRIAL OF THIS CASE AND MADE THE STATEMENT WHICH REMAINED UNCONTRADICTED THAT HE AND THE DECEASED WERE NEVER UNFRIENDLY THAT THEY AMICABLY SETTLED THE LITTLE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM ABOUT SOME DITCHING SOME TIME BEFORE THE DECEASEDS DEATH AND THAT HE WITNESS WAS NOT IN THE COUNTY OF NANSEMOND BUT IN THE COUNTY OF ISLE OF WIGHT ON OCTOBER 26 1908 THE DATE OF THE MURDER OF THE DECEASED THE ACCUSED WAS CLEARLY PUT IN A POSITION IN WHICH IT WAS IN CUMBENT UPON HIM TO EXPLAIN THE INCRIMINATING CIRCUMSTANCES POINTING TO HIM AS THE PARTY GUILTY OF THE HORRIBLE CRIME WITH WHICH HE WAS CHARGED IF HE HAD MADE A BONA FIDE DISPOSITION OF THE GUN IN QUESTION HE COULD HAVE PROVEN IT BEYOND ALL DOUBT AND HIS EFFORT TO PROVE THAT FACT AND AN ALIBI BY UNSATISFACTORY EVIDENCE LEFT HIM IN A WORSE CONDITION THAN IF HE HAD NOT MADE AN EFFORT IT IS WELL RECOGNIZED THAT THE CONDUCT OF ONE ACCUSED OF A CRIME AFTER ITS COMMISSION BECOMES KNOWN IS A CIRCUMSTANCE TO BE CONSIDERED ON THE DAY AFTER THE COMMISSION OF THIS MURDER 270 AUGUSTHARDY V COMMONWEALTH WHEN ALL OR NEARLY ALL PERSONS IN AND AROUND THE LITTLE TOWN OF HOLLAND WERE GOING TO THE HOME OF THE DECEASED OFFERING SYM PATHY TO THE FAMILY AND TO AID IN RUNNING DOWN THE PERPETRATOR OF THE CRIME THE ACCUSED WENT NOT TO THE HOME OF THE DECEASED NOR DID HE MANIFEST THE LEAST CONCERN AS TO WHAT HAD HAPPENED BUT IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY WHEN IT HAD BECOME GENERALLY KNOWN THAT BLOODHOUNDS HAD BEEN ORDERED AND WERE EXPECTED SOON TO ARRIVE HE MOUNTED A LUMBER WAGON AND RODE AWAY INTO THE FOREST WHERE HE REMAINED FOR HOURS AND DOUBTLESS TILL ALL FEAR OF BEING PURSUED BY BLOODHOUNDS HAD VANISHED THE JURY HAVE CONSIDERED THE VICIOUS AND REPEATED THREATS PROVEN TO HAVE BEEN MADE BY THE ACCUSED GOING TO SHOW THAT HE WAS A DECLARED ENEMY OF THE MURDERED MAN HAVING A MOTIVE TO TAKE HIS LIFE THAT HE HAD A DOUBLE MOTIVEONE OF REVENGE THE OTHER TO PREVENT A PROSECUTION AGAINST HIM FOR A CRIMINAL OFFENSE IN FACT TWO FOR ONE OF WHICH IF FOUND GUILTY HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SEVERELY PUNISHED AND ALL THE EVIDENCE TENDING TO PROVE THE MOTIVE THE PROXIMITY AND THE OPPORTUNITY AND ALL OF WHICH CONCENTRATED ON THE ACCUSED HIS EFFORTS TO BREAK DOWN THIS OVERWHELMING PROOF ADDUCED BY THE COMMONWEALTH WHOLLY FAILING THE ENTIRE EVIDENCE IN THE CASE HAS HAD CAREFUL CONSID ERATION AND WHILE THERE ARE NATURALLY NUMEROUS CONFLICTS AND INCONSISTENT STATEMENTS OF WITNESSES THEREIN THE JURY WERE THE SOLE JUDGES OF THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH THE EVIDENCE TENDED TO PROVE AND THE INFERENCES OR CONCLUSIONS TO BE DRAWN THEREFROM AND THEY HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE EVIDENCE ESTABLISHED THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED BY A LONG LINE OF DECISIONS BY THIS COURT COMING DOWN TO OBOYLES CASE SUPRA AND LATER IT HAS BEEN SETTLED THAT THE JURY ARE NOT ONLY THE JUDGES OF THE CREDIBILITY OF WITNESSES BUT OF THE WEIGHT TO BE GIVEN TO THEIR TESTIMONY AND THEIR VERDICT SOLVES ALL CONFLICTS AND CONTRADICTIONS AMONG THEM THAT A COURT HAS NO POWER TO GRANT A NEW TRIAL UNLESS THE VERDICT IS AGAINST THE LAW OR IS CONTRARY TO THE EVIDENCE OR IS WITHOUT EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT IT UPON THE WHOLE CASE WE ARE OF OPINION THAT THE VERDICT AGAINST THE ACCUSED WAS NOT ONLY FAIRLY RENDERED BUT IS AMPLY SUPPORTED BY THE EVIDENCE AND THEREFORE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE VERDICT OF THE JURY IS AFFIRMED AFFIRMED 1910 271

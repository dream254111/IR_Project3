j100335,The Quarterly Journal of Economics,1882659,Types of American Labor OrganizationThe Teamsters of Chicago,i332319,TYPES OF AMERICAN LABOR ORGANIZATION THE TEAMSTERS OF CHICAGO ONLY since the year 1902 have the teamsters of Chicago discovered their power They have always been classed as unskilled labor and the oldline tradeunionist ridiculed and discouraged the organizers who ventured to create a teamsters union The skilled unions saw the strate gic position of the teamster and the brewery workers made some of the brewery drivers a part of their industrial union But the driver felt that they wanted him not to help him but to help themselves Only when he broke away and organized his own teamsters union did he get enthusiasm for union principles Again the teamster had never been clearly distinguished from the teamowner The oldest socalled union was that of the hackdrivers organized in 1867 But that was a union of hackowners as much as hackdrivers since the majority owned the rigs they drove Conse quently their interest lay more in holding up the fares charged to the public than the wages earned by the driver Their organization was never influential and often coma tose Not until 1902 did they take in the livery drivers employed by the great companies and thereby become a labor union as well as a guild Their history since then is similar to that of other teamsters and drivers IPolitical and industrial conditions in the United States have given rise to types of labor organization unique in many respects In a former article Quarterly Journal of Economics November 1904 was described an organization influenced by division of labor and by immigration in an industry controlled by a socalled  trust slaughtering and meat packing In the present article is described an organization or set of organizations not directly affected by immigration but composed of unskilled labor holding a highly strategic position in industry under employers for the most part severely competing with each other It is intended in later articles to describe other typesJ R CTYPES OF AMERICAN LABOR ORGANIZATION 401 The laws of the former International Team Drivers Union chartered by the American Federation of Labor in 1899 admitted to membership a teamowner if he op erated not more than five teams This threw the unions the conventions and the laws into the hands of the owners and prices were more prominent than wages Such a union was inherently weak While the larger team owners were formally excluded yet their teamsters were not attracted to a union whose views respecting wages were those of small teamowners The first object necessary to form an effective union was community of interest and this required separation from employers The Chi cago teamsters in defiance of their international organiza tion refused to admit owners and finally in 1902 they seceded and formed a new national union including only teamsters and helpers They admitted the driver who owned the team he operated but excluded him if he owned a team driven by some one else Even this differentiation was not enough Teamsters are employed in every industry No craft is so necessary and universal But teaming in one industry is distinct from teaming in another The laundry driver has little in common with the coal teamster except horses and streets His problems of unionism such as methods of payment hours and discipline are different In 1894 coal teamsters truckdrivers and others were in a general union just as they are today in smaller towns But that union quickly disappeared In 1886 something similar had occurred under the Knights of Labor But in 1902 each industry was organized separately in its own local Though each is called a local union it is more than local in the geographical sense Each local is a distinct craft with jurisdiction over the entire city for all workmen of its craft and the principle recognized for all is the same as that explicitly stated by the Ice Wagon Drivers Our402 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS Local Union has the powers of selfgovernment known as Local Autonomy and if deemed advisable to make such bylaws that will be beneficent to the local organization such as admitting persons who own and operate one team regulating initiation fees or dues honorable with drawal cards trials fines suspensions and expulsions in conformity with the general laws There are of course many cases where locals overlap and in order to avoid conflict of jurisdiction each stable is assigned to the local to which 51 per cent or more of its work belongs Thus the teamsters of Chicago were the first to establish two principles new to the occupationcraft autonomy and wage unionism Starting with these principles within two years there were organized 47 locals from the Truck Drivers with over 5000 members to the Dye House Drivers with 46 Afterwards this differentiation was found too fine and some of the smaller locals were merged into others Nearly all were organized during the first year They created a joint executive council of seven delegates from each local with power over strikes and in 1903 they amalgamated with the International Team Drivers which meanwhile had changed its constitution to exclude employers The organization now is known as the International Brotherhood of Teamsters with 821 locals in some 300 cities Such sudden and precipitate organization was accom plished and recognized with scarcely a halfdozen strikes This was owing partly to the secrecy maintained but mainly to an early demonstration of power and a sym pathetic interest on the part of one class of teamowners This second factor is explained by the peculiar nature of the business The two classes of teamowners are those who follow teaming for a living and those whose teaming is an ad junct to their general business The latter include theTYPES OF AMERICAN LABOR ORGANIZATION 403 department stores the meatpackers grocers and meat markets the brewers the largest manufacturers the milkdealers lumberdealers railway express companies ice companies some of the wholesale merchants and others The former include truckowners expressmen and vanowners liverymen the commission teamowners and to a lesser degree coal teamowners ice wagon owners and similar teaming contractors The signifi cance of this distinction lies in the fact that many of the manufacturers and most of the wholesale merchants and commission houses do their teaming through con tractors With the manufacturers and wholesale mer chants the teamsters wages are but a small part of their total expenses With the retail merchants the proportion is larger the largest being that of the milkdealers15 per cent or less But with the contracting teamowners the wages of teamsters and helpers are 50 per cent to 75 per cent of their total expenses Consequently while competition of manufacturers and merchants is but slightly affected by the teamsters wages competi tion of teamowners is mainly a question of the wages and hours of their competitors The manufacturer and wholesale merchant are interested in keeping wages low but the teamowner is interested in keeping them equal The teamowner has therefore welcomed and encour aged the organization of the teamsters notwithstanding an extraordinary increase in the rates of wages because the union equalized competition In taking this atti tude his position has not been the same as that of the merchant or manufacturer whose cost of trucking was increased whether done directly or by contract One consequence is that the teamownersby which will be meant those with whom teaming is their business and not an adjuncthave organized associations not only as employers to negotiate with the unions but also as404 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS contractors to regulate rates of cartage and livery The principal associations of this kind are the Chicago Team Owners dealing with the truckdrivers the Furniture Movers and Expressmens Association dealing with the Van Teamsters and Helpers and the Baggage and Parcel Delivery Drivers and Helpers the Commission Team Owners dealing with the Commission Drivers and four liverymens associations dealing with the Hack Coup6 and Livery Drivers These associations by joint agree ments determine the rates of wages and the hours and conditions of labor and the scales thus determined are the union scales paid also by merchants and manufact urers not members of the association to their teamsters employed directly Many of the other teamsters unions have joint agreements with employers associations but such associations being composed of merchants or manu facturers are loose and informal while the associations just mentioned are compact and permanent some of them with bonds and forfeits binding them not only to the scale of wages but also to the scale of prices The Coal Team Owners and their drivers deserve special mention by reason of their early leadership and their peculiar methods The drivers were organized in the fall of 1900 and secured individual agreements during 1901 They made further demands in the winter of 19012 which added to those already secured doubled the cost of teaming For a twohorse wagon they formerly received 50 cents a load of 4 or 5 tons and for a three horse wagon 65 cents a load of 6 or 7 tons regardless of distance At these rates the labor cost of cartage was about 10 cents a ton and the teamster earned 8 to 12 a week of indefinite hours The scale finally agreed upon substitutes a weekly rate and overtime for the former piece rates The twohorse driver receives 15 and the threehorse driver 18 for a week of 66 hoursTYPES OF AMERICAN LABOR ORGANIZATION 405 and 35 cents and 40 cents an hour overtime respectively At these rates the labor cost was raised to about 20 cents a ton In order to pay these higher wages the coaldealers contended that they must get higher prices for cartage The antitrust law of Illinois as amended in 1897 made an exception in favor of any article  the cost of which is mainly made up of wages To avail themselves of this exception the coaldealers separated their cartage from their coal and organized not a dealers association but a Coal Team Owners Association since the cost of cartage but not the cost of coal is mainly made up of wages and since a teamowner does not have title in the prop erty he delivers and is therefore not responsible for its price to the public There is also a considerable amount of coal hauled by contract and contracting teamowners who are not dealers are also members of the association The rates charged for cartage had formerly been 22 to 27 cents a ton The association adopted and issued a schedule setting the rates at 50 cents a ton for manufactur ing and steam use and 60 cents a ton for domestic use within two and onehalf miles from the point of loading for each additional mile or fraction thereof 10 cents a ton Thus the rates for cartage were doubled when the teamsters wages were doubled But since they started on different bases it is also true that the absolute increase in cartage was twice as great as the increase in wages namely 20 to 25 cents a ton when wages were increased 10 cents a ton There are of course other expenses besides wages mainly feed and care of horses and these are of fered as a justification for the disproportionate advance though the occasion thereof was the advance in wages At the same time since the dealers mainly own their 1 This exception was afterwards declared unconstitutional as being an unlawful discrimination See People v Butler Street Foundry Co 201 Ill 236406 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS teams and their prices for coal include delivery their ability to maintain the rate of cartage really depends on their ability to maintain the price of coal This they have not been able to do on bituminous coal on account of the many sources of supply while they have thoroughly succeeded on anthracite coal on account of the centralized control of supply However this may be the coaldealers at first relied upon the teamsters to control the market and even create one They made a provisional agreement in January 1902 to take effect the following May for five years if the teamsters meanwhile could demonstrate their power The agreement provided that none but members of the union should be employed and that the teamsters should work for none but members of the association With this understanding the agent of the teamsters in return for increased wages stopped the delivery of coal to the great firm of Marshall Field  Co for a few hours in winter until that firm signed a twoyear contract with the union to use coal instead of natural gas during the summer This spectacular demonstration had two results The managers of other stores and office buildings who also had made the mistake of building skyscrapers without coal bunkers signed a similar contract when requested and nearly all of the teamsters in Chicago joined the union The astute agent of the coal teamowners John C Driscoll by name who had engineered this coup proceeded on his part to organize the teamowners in other branches and eventually became secretary of five such associations In each case agreements similar to the original one were made with the new teamsters locals These and other locals were organized without general strikes except those of the packing house and department store teamsters in June Yet while they had but few strikes on their own account the teamsters in the first flush of enthusiTYPES OF AMERICAN LABOR ORGANIZATION 407 asm stopped work in sympathy with strikers on the in side and this in the case of the freight handlers in July was the most destructive since 1894 That disaster so bered the teamster but it showed him his power Springing from these sympathetic strikes came the most remarkable board of arbitration known to industrial dis putes Seven of the largest employers of teamsters and seven agents of the teamsters unions constituted them selves for one year the industrial umpires of Chicago Practically all of the strikes of new unions during that period came before this board The older unions such as the building trades disdained this upstart jurisprudence and refused to submit their disputes But it happened that most of the strikes of that period were those of new unions The boards powers were quasicompulsory since the employer who would not submit to arbitration could not get teamsters and the strikers who would not submit could not get the help of the teamsters Many of the strikes were handled by Driscoll the agent of the teaming employers without bringing them before the Board of Arbitration and had it not been for his unscru pulous use of money in bribing the leaders of the unions the board might have continued But his corruption was finally exposed the teamsters withdrew their represen tatives and eventually deposed the officers who had been on friendly terms with him The Board of Arbitra tion was dissolved Employers also who were willing that Driscoll should use their money to buy off the leaders of troublesome strikes became distrustful when they learned that he secretly fomented strikes to be bought off He lost his position in all but the Coal Team Owners Association and the others substituted men of a different type Since this reform movement of 1903 the teaming industry can be studied as an economic rather than a criminal phenomenon408 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS Hours and Wages The change most impressive brought about by the unions is that from indefinite hours and wages to definite wages and pay for overtime The teamsters occupation is peculiar in that it has carried over and retained in indus try the practices of agriculture The teamster has always been expected to care for his stock as well as drive his wagon Even where a teaming contractors business had grown so large as to require the services of stable men the teamster was expected to be at the stable before working time and to remain at the stable after working time long enough to feed and curry his horses clean their stalls grease and repair his wagon hitch up and un hitch and keep his harness clean and the brass polished This required also several hours on Sunday For such work he was not supposed to be paidit was the necessary preparation for work and not the real productive effort that brought him wages This continues to hold good under the union agreements and while the teamster says that he now has a tenhour working day it is nearly always from 6 AM to 6 or 630 PM with one hour for dinner Consequently the actual working time for which his stipu lated days wages is paid is 11 or 11 hours This en ables the truckdriver to back his wagon up to the plat form for his first load at 7 oclock the time when the inside workers begin and to get his last load in time to return to the stable and leave for home at about 6 PM Formerly he might not get his last load till the in side workers quit and this might keep him at the barn till 8 or 9 oclock and even later In some lines of team ing not depending on factories and warehouses such as furniture moving groceries markets commission driving he was called out much earlier in the morning or kept later at night according to the amount of work the teamTYPES OF AMERICAN LABOR ORGANIZA TION 409 owner could find for him to do The van teamster who took out a sleighing party was not paid for it because that was night work Often he and others reported at the stable at 3 4 or 5 oclock in the morning and left the stable at 8 9 or 10 at night On this account it is impossible to know the number of hours most of the teamsters formerly worked Not being paid for over time their former earnings give no indication of the hours employed In general they ranged from 70 to 100 hours a week according to seasons and kinds of teaming These hours have been reduced in two ways First by cutting out Sunday work or stipulating that it shall be paid at one and onehalf or double rates and second by stipulating a rate per hour for overtime before 6 AM and after 6 PM Under these conditions the larger team owners employ stablemen to do much of the work formerly done by the teamsters and in order to avoid the higher rates for overtime they try to arrange their work to bring it within the regular time The wholesale merchant who kept his truckdriver hauling to the railways during the day and then gave him a city load late in the after noon now concentrates his schedule of trips Never theless in some lines the teamster continues to make a large amount of overtime It is not unusual for the coal teamster at 18 a week and 40 cents overtime to earn 20 or 24 a week In other branches overtime varies greatly according to the business Consequently in this industry the policy of reducing the hours of labor is nec essarily often a policy of merely getting pay for over time and so greatly increasing the earnings The driver must finish his trip and return his team to the stable and while overtime cannot always be abolished it can be paid for Again there are some lines in which very little change in the hours except Sunday relief has occurred The410 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS railway express drivers never had the care of their horses and their reduction in hours has been but 3 or 4 a week The laundry and bakery drivers have about the same hours as formerly The routes of the kegbeer drivers had always been equalized so that they could finish their work in the morning but they were kept around the barn indefinitely for extra jobs and errands These have been cut off The action of the milkwagon drivers deserves special mention They directed their efforts at first not to the rates of wages but to the hours of work Formerly in the summer they started out at 1 to 4 oclock in the morning made a delivery of milk in the forenoon and a second delivery in the afternoon returned at 4 or 5 oclock spent one or two hours in balancing their books and got away at 6 or 7 in the evening making 12 to 18 hours a day Then they worked 10 hours on Sunday delivering milk and caring for their horses and wagons altogether 100 hours a week for 10 or 12 In the winter they began at 6 AM making 80 hours a week Their first step after organizing in January 1903 was to cut out the second delivery to fix their hours in winter at 8 to 5 and to decide that in summer no delivery should be made in the afternoon and all wagons must be off the street by 1 PM This brought the hours to about 52 a week including 4 hours on Sundaya reduction of nearly 50 hours in summer and 30 hours in winter Within the past three years their wages have advanced to 45 and 60 a month so that the rate of pay per hour has more than doubled These are minimum rates There are also route men whose commissions on sales bring their total earnings to 70 or 80 a month Public amazement and invective followed the one dailydelivery system The rule was adopted in Janu ary and did not attract attention until warm weatherTYPES OF AMERICAN LABOR ORGANIZATION 411 Then the newspapers with several columns daily at tacked the union Early in June the Commissioner of Health stated in his weekly bulletin The onedaily delivery of milk has begun to reap its harvest Even in welltodo families this thirtysix to sixty hours old milk cannot be kept from souring from one delivery to the next Herod was more merciful in the method he used in his slaughter of the innocents Now that two summers have passed a somewhat cooler estimate can be made of the drivers action In fact the change to the onedailydelivery of milk could have but little effect directly on the deathrate of children The milk formerly delivered in the afternoon was from exactly the same milking as that delivered in the fore noon the only difference was that the driver carried a part or all of it around in his wagon all day instead of leaving it at the house in the morning The mornings deliveries are always with the unimportant exception noted below at least twentyfour and thirtysix hours old having been drawn the morning of the day before and the evening of the second day before Furthermore in the poorer sections of the city where home refrigerators are scarce a large part of the milk has always been bought at groceries or depots conveniently located in nearly every block In 1904 there were issued 2424 milk licenses for such stores against 2516 for wagons Both drivers and dealers state that almost their only afternoon cus tomers were in the wealthier sections of the city and the amount taken was small being only such as the mistress I At the close of the first season the Health Commissioners statistics showed that the number of deaths of children under five years of age during the three summer months July August and September was ten less than that of the preceding year and at the close of the second season 1904 his figures for the same months showed a still further decrease of 388 deaths The deathrate of children under five for the twelve months remained stationary the first year and fell from 3939 per 1000 living to 3264 the second year and the number of deaths in the three sum mer months which had been 304 per cent of the years total in 1902 fell to 266 per cent of the smaller years total in 1904412 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS wanted for an unexpected guest or an extra function On the whole it appears that the afternoon delivery was a needless waste imposed by the thoughtlessness of house wives The fifty hours saved each week to the drivers have not laid any hardship on the public While not directly affecting the deathrate the revolt of the drivers indirectly reduced it by awakening public conscience and bringing about reforms in the municipal health department The Childrens Hospital Society at once created a Milk Commissign with physicians bac teriologists and representatives of the Womens Club established a laboratory and by special arrangement sent out milk fourteen hours old in bottles to sick chil dren of the congested districts and the hospitals The Civic Federation employed the biological department of the University of Chicago to test some three hundred samples of milk from various sources Their report reflected unfavorably upon the inspection of the Municipal Department of Health and finally led in 1904 to the ap pointment of an additional force of milk inspectors in cluding four country inspectors to visit farms and all inspectors were instructed to pay special attention to the sanitary condition of dairies and utensils In that year for the first time the departments bacteriologist made a systematic examination of the citys market milk Con siderable amounts of milk were condemned nineteen milk pedlers premises were abolished several hundred dealers were notified to place and keep their depots in sanitary condition An ordinance was adopted requir ing metal seals to cans by means of which responsibility can be fixed on the shipper the railway employee or the dealer resulting in a decrease of milk watering by 50 per cent The railroads were induced to furnish better facilities for handling Coupled with a cool summer I Report of Bacteriologist and Director of the Municipal Laboratory 1904 MSTYPES OF AMERICAN LABOR ORGANIZATION 413 in 1904 and the completion of sewer systems and the drainage canal the deathrate of all ages declined some what and the deathrate of children declined still more as stated above On the whole the stand taken by the milkwagon drivers diverted attention from a false secur ity on two deliveries of milk a day to the real source of dangeran inadequate milk inspection Earnings The wages formerly earned were as indefinite as the hours While the books of the teamowners if examined would throw no light on the former rates of pay per hour they would show the earnings by the week or month In lieu of such an examination the testimony of employ ers and men has been found to agree remarkably in some lines and fairly well in others Apparent disagreements are explained by the existence of exceptionally high or exceptionally low wages The policy of the unions has been to establish a minimum rate of pay and then to stipu late that no employee receiving more than the scale shall suffer a reduction Consequently exceptionally high men especially in those lines where commissions are paid have not gained an increase in weekly earnings though the reduction in hours has increased their hourly rates while the lowest paid positions have been substantially increased by the week and amazingly increased by the hour Looking at the position of thfe average teamster without special abilities or disabilities it may be said that for 70 to 100 hours work his earnings before organi zation were 8 to 12 a week Some grocery drivers garbage collectors beer wagonhelpers and many boys got as little as 450 and 6 while men on commission got as much as 25 or 30 but the prevailing testimony sets the bulk of the earnings at 9 Since organization414 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS the minimum rates per week have been raised so that they range from 10 for retail grocery drivers to 18 for a threehorse coal teamdriver the standard towards which all seem to be aiming being 15 a week of six days and the rate that the largest number have reached being some what less The advances made for helpers are relatively greater than those for drivers bringing the two closer to gether both on a higher level While these increases are large they nearly always exaggerate the increased labor cost to the employers Often the highest paid men were not affected and the better paid men were already close to the new minimum In some lines like department stores and railway express only one company was paying the extremely low rates and that usually to boys In other lines this proportion was larger The boys have been discharged and men have taken their places and their greater efficiency some what offsets the apparent increase in pay Furthermore from the teamsters standpoint the reduction in hours which has so enormously increased his hourly rate has often been in the hours uselessly spent in waiting or doing uneconomical work in order to be on hand when wanted Such wasted hours the employer did not count and their reduction does not increase proportionately his hourly cost because now he keeps the teamster busy every minute while on duty Consequently the teamowners increased labor cost is not to be measured by the teamsters ex traordinary gain by the hour as would naturally be sup posed but rather by his more moderate gain by the week Commissions In several lines the teamster is more than a driver he is a solicitor or order clerk and he can build up or break down his employers business In some cases the comTYPES OF AMERICAN LABOR ORGANIZA TION 415 panies have regular solicitors who are not drivers but even then the driver must be relied upon to hold his trade This takes an extreme form in the laundry busi ness where in a union of 700 members there are 200 drivers known as commission men who own each a horse and wagon and control their trade Some of these men have agencies at hotels newsstands and so on where orders may be left They can transfer their business from one laundry to another and their commission is 40 per cent At such rates the most successful driver makes as much as 100 a week Nat urally the laundrymen objected to this power of trans ferring business and they began to require contracts pre venting a man on leaving their employment from going into the laundry business for two years thereafter The courts refused to sustain such contracts but afterwards when they were modified so as to limit their operation to a designated territory they were sustained The union met the policy of the laundrymen by a clause in their agreements stipu lating that drivers owning their own wagon and known as commission men should receive not less than 40 per cent of the gross amount of work and that no driver shall be requested to sign any contract conflicting with this agreement Evidently a union of solicitors owning their places of business protecting their commissions and maintaining their power to throw business from one employer to another partakes more of the nature of a merchants guild than a labor union In the case of laundry drivers not owning their wagons the union agree ment provides a minimum salary of 15 a week which is an advance of something like 50 per cent on their former wages In addition many of them get a commis sion on business beyond a certain amount The rule of a minimum salary holds for drivers in all other lines where commissions are paid the laundrymen owning their416 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS wagons being the only class paid solely by commissions without a minimum guaranty In the case of the bakery drivers the guaranty is 14 a week which would be useful only in the outdistricts where business is light but where the union does not yet control The valuable advances are in the rates of com mission and these apply to the large bakeries supplying the downtown district Here the minimum of 14 is significant not as a true minimum but as a basis on which to compute the commissions For example the best pay ing company in the city which formerly paid 14 a week and 6 per cent on sales above 250 now pays 14 a week and 1i per cent on business up to 150 3 per cent on the excess to 250 and 7 per cent on the excess above 250 Consequently a driver who formerly received 17 on a weeks business of 300 now gets 2275 The larger his business the larger has been the rate of increase in his earnings a few getting as much as 40 a week and none less than 16 The commission scheme of the beerdrivers is suggestive The bottlebeer driver more than the kegbeer driver is expected to hold his trade In both cases the com mission is paid not on the sales but on the empties returned and in both cases the commission has always been looked upon as spendingmoney The bottlebeer driver joins many lodges to which bartenders belong He seldom sees the saloon proprietor for his visits are made early in the morning His persuasiveness is ex erted on the bartender To prevent him from transfer ring his trade from one brewery to another the brewers have a strong association and an agreement not to take another brewers driver The agreement is enforced by a clearinghouse organized as follows The driver does not get all of the empties Many of them are thrown in the alleys and back yards and come into the hands ofTYPES OF AMERICAN LABOR ORGANIZA TION 417 junkdealers These sell them to the clearinghouse of the brewers association The brewer who does not abide by the rules of the association cannot get back his junk bottles through the clearinghouse until his fine is paid This is one of the means that hold the brewers together in fixing prices and resisting organized labor Lacking such a clearinghouse the laundrymen have not been able as effectively to resist the commission men The kegbeer driver gets his salary of 80 a month and 4 cents additional on empty kegs returned Before organization his salary was 60 to 80 and his commission was 8 cents but out of this he paid his helper 20 to 35 a month Now the helper gets 55 a month paid by the brewer and the driver tries to keep his commission through a clause in the agreement providing that pedlers helpers and extra drivers shall not be required to spend any money with customers on their routes and their not spending any money shall not be cause for any com plaint or discharge Under this arrangement the major ity  take home more than their salary and the best men with the best routes are said to earn net as much as 30 or 35 a week The milkwagon drivers commission is computed on the basis of 1 cent to the point a point being the unit of each article sold as a quart of milk a halfpint of cream or a pound of butter This figures out about 14 per cent on sales but he is usually paid a minimum of 60 a month if his sales do not yield so much and onehalf cent a point on sales above the amount necessary to compute the minimum at 1 cent The best man earns 100 and the majority in the service of the big firms earn 65 The commission is optional and very few of the small dealers pay it The union demands for 1905 would make it compulsory would raise it to 11 cent and would for the first time establish a minimum wage418 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS of 1750 per week instead of the fluctuating minima ranging from 45 paid by the small dealer to 60 paid by the large dealer The commission system fades into the graded salary system in the case of the yeastwagon drivers belonging to the bakery drivers local The union has changed the grading and promotions from the basis of individual bar gaining to the basis of seniority the driver beginning at 15 and advancing 1 at the end of the first year and then 1 at twoyear intervals until at the end of the seventh year he reaches 19 Since the startingpoint was for merly 12 and seniority was counted back for those in the service at the time when the change was made some of the best men received no advance while others long in the service but not hitherto preferred by employers were advanced at once from 12 a week to 18 and 19 In the case of the grocery and market drivers the range of wages was formerly extreme since experienced men were rare and unsuitable men abundant The best com manded 25 or 30 a week and the poorest 5 a week The union did not attempt to grade all the men according to seniority but contented itself with grading the order clerks or those controlling their own trade in three classes of 12 13 and 14 for the first three sixmonth periods and leaving further promotions to the employer For other classes of drivers they simply raised the mini mum from say 11 a week in the wholesale trade to 15 and from 5 a week for retail drivers to 10 The same distinction appears among the railway ex press drivers The union grades the  conductor  on a double wagon who is a solicitor as well as the responsi ble man under bonds at 6250 the first three months 6750 after three months and 70 after six months but fixes a flat rate for the driver Apart from these three grades promotions to higher pay are at the discretion ofTYPES OF AMERICAN LABOR ORGANIZATION 419 the six companies among whom competition is keen and the best solicitors eagerly sought In these cases we can see the transition to the ordinary teamster who does not control his trade This is the situation with the great bulk of teaming such as that of the truck driver coal teamster buildingmaterial driver and so on In general wherever the commission or pre mium system on sales is possible the union prefers it and even requires it but where the commission cannot be definitely measured because the traffic is miscella neous the union tries to substitute grading according to seniority And finally where the teamster is only a driver and not a solicitor the union establishes simply a flat minimum There is one exception to the last state ment This is loading unloading and hauling common brick from the cars to the building employing about 200 men in a union of 700 The price formerly was 36 cents per 1000 raised by agreement with the union to 40 cents at which the driver earns 3 to 4 a day com pared with a day rate of 225 in the same local union With this exception the ordinary driver in the different locals is paid by the week or month Besides wages and hours the unions have secured relief from exactions which the members consider important The department store drivers and the livery drivers no longer purchase their uniforms at company prices The expense of securing bonds required of many classes of teamsters amounting to 5 a year is now borne by the employer The grocery and market wagon drivers are no longer responsible for goods stolen off their wagons or goods spoiled by kerosene and they as well as the de partment store and other classes of retail delivery drivers are protected against losses for which they are not re sponsible on C 0 D packages and on goods returned The agreements in all cases contain an arbitration clause420 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS whereby an umpire decides if employer and employee cannot agree Strikes The experience of the unions has led to a decided change in the matter of strikes Sympathetic strikes seem to have been eliminated during the past two years except where a sister local of teamsters was involved As far as other industries are concerned the teamsters have en deavored to adopt the letalone policy of the railway brotherhoods although within the past few weeks they have listened to the appeals of the garment workers and violated this policy as well as their agreements All of their agreements require work to be continued pending arbitration A vote to strike must be taken on paper ballots and must have a twothirds

 unless there is sufficient funds on hand in the International Union to pay strike benefits of 5 a week The truckdrivers like others issue a card to their stewards as follows ADVICE TO STEWARDS 1

both sides of the case and if the employer is right tell the member so If he is not satisfied send him to the officials of the Local If the employer refuses to comply with the Stewards de cision notify the officials at once 6 Stewards must not call a strike unless authorized by the Local through its officers 7 Stewards should use their influence to prevent a strike until the officers have had a chance to adjust the difference 8 Stewards should attend as many meetings as they possibly canTYPES OF AMERICAN LABOR ORGANIZA TION 421 If it decides to sustain the local it sends a representative to take charge of the negotiations and to order a strike if he deems it advisable A local striking without such approval receives no support The controlling influence of the International is strength ened by the system of finance Out of the local dues of 50 cents a month 15 cents are paid to the International treasury whose funds are said to be large no figures are published The locals have moderate treasuries mainly for insurance benefits and the International is expected after the first week to support the strikes it approves Nearly all of the locals pay death benefits of 100 adding 10 for flowers The coal teamsters tried sick benefits for a while but stopped the experiment because too many got sick The initiation fees of several locals are 525 but the coal truck ice van railway express and a few other locals have advanced the fee to 15 For a time the Truck Drivers placed theirs at 25 but afterwards reduced it to 15 which seems to be the figure towards which all are tending Usually the fee is paid in instalments over five or six weeks after the novitiate has gone to work Certain ice companies check off the fee from wages and pay it over to the union treasury but this practice is an exception The  Closed and Open Stable There is a wide diversity among the agreements respect ing the employment of union members Some of them like those of the railway express drivers and department store drivers simply say There shall be no discrimina tion against union drivers The majority are similar to the Truck Drivers agreement which reads Party of the first part agrees to employ members of the Truck422 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS Drivers Union Local 705 when in their power to do so The Furniture Drivers agreement formerly read as fol lows Party of the first part agrees to employ members of the Furniture Drivers and Helpers Local No 722 or those who will make application within twelve hours after receiving employment and become a member at the next regular meeting of the organization In hir ing men the union men to have the preference This is also the form of several other agreements such as that of the Grocery and Market Wagon Drivers It amounted to an openshop agreement and because advantage had been taken of it to weaken the union the Furniture Drivers Local went on strike at its termination in October 1904 to secure a closedshop agreement A compromise was finally made and this clause was changed to read There shall be no discrimination against union drivers or helpers In hiring men party of the first part agrees to give prefer ence to members of Local 722 In practice this new agreement makes the union headquarters the employ ment office of the Wholesale Furniture Dealers The Commission Team Owners agree likewise to em ploy none but members of Commission Drivers Union Local No 3 in good standing and carrying the regular working card of the organization if such drivers can be supplied by the business agent of Local No 3 or compe tent men who are willing to become members of said Local No 3 Besides that of the coal teamsters al ready cited the Van Teamsters agreement is strictly closed shop as follows Party of the first part agrees to employ none but members of the Van Teamsters and Helpers Union Local 711 I B of T in good standing and carrying the regular working card of the organiza tion Whatever the form of these agreements they operate to give members of the unions steady employment asTYPES OF AMERICAN LABOR ORGANIZATION 423 against the introduction of outsiders Yet except in the two or three strictly closedshop agreements the team owners say that they can employ any man they see fit whether union member or not provided they pay the scale and he joins the union They discharge him how ever if the union brings charges against him and does not admit him The high scale of wages makes it to their interest to employ experienced men who know the depots and routes Hence in the case of the teamowners asso ciations the openshop question has never come up In others it causes friction and sometimes strikes This is especially true of the laundry business where the only prolonged strike which now has lasted since June 1904 turns on the clause of the former agreement conceding to the laundrymen the right to hire nonmembers In some cases the union cannot furnish members when called upon notably the Ice Wagon Drivers and Helpers more than onehalf of whose members leave the city during the winter On this account they take in some 300 new mem bers each season in a total membership of 1800 Their agreement reads We concede the employer the right to hire all Ice Wagon Drivers and Helpers providing he notifies the officials of the Ice Wagon Drivers and Helpers Local Union No 2 within twelve hours after employing said Drivers and Helpers and if there are any charges against said Driver and Helper the employer on his part agrees to discharge said driver or helper within twelve hours after receiving notice from the officials of the Ice Wagon Drivers and Helpers Local Union No 2 In hiring men the union men to have preference The above twelvehour clause is found in most of the open shop agreements In these and all other cases more reliance is placed on the daily attitude of the employers and their representa tives than on the wording of the agreements The unions424 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS stand ready to strike on evidence of persistent discrimi nation by which is sometimes meant the employment of nonmembers when members are unemployed The em ployers on their side with the exceptions mentioned prac tise conciliation and realize that if they kept nonunion men in their employment they could destroy the unions Furthermore the teamsters occupation is more exposed than that of any other craftsman Each driver is an es tablishment of himself In the crowded streets with 30000 teamsters organized there is not much room for the unorganized Actual or expected violence is looked upon by employers and teamsters as a matter of course Blockades and obstruction more than violence are effective and all union drivers are expected to do what the truckdrivers explicitly command in their bylaws All members of this local shall at all times while on duty wear his union button in plain sight so it can be seen by any one Any member failing to do so shall be subject to a fine of not less than 1 for each offence It will thus be seen that the agreements whether closed shop  or open shop in form are union shop in practice On the other hand the reciprocal feature of the coal teamsters provisional agreement which forbade union drivers to work for employers not members of the team owners association has been eliminated In its place the following was substituted The organization agrees on its part to do all in its power to further the inter ests of said Association The Commission Drivers made the same agreement with the Commission Team Owners Association The Van Teamsters and Truck Drivers agree not to further the interests of the associa tions of teamowners but simply to further the inter ests of their employer These peculiar clauses do not mean that the drivers will work only for members of those associations since there are drivers working for nonTYPES OF AMERICAN LABOR ORGANIZA TION 425 members They simply mean that the drivers will not work for nonmembers on terms more favorable than those granted to members The object is not that of an exclu sive agreement but that of equalizing competitive con ditions One result undoubtedly is to strengthen the teamowners associations and to enable them better to maintain their official scales of cartage Prior to the or ganization of the unions the owners associations were weak and ineffective Their official scales were cut by destructive competition Now they include nearly all the teamowners who seek the cover of the association for protection against the union The prices for cartage have in most cases been raised but it is impossible to know how much The official cartage scales have been advanced 20 to 40 per cent but this is not decisive for they were not enforced whereas the present scales are fairly well enforced The double wagon which the truckowners scale formerly set at 24 a week with driver and which was actually hired by the merchant at 22 to 26 is now hired at a minimum of 31 The single wagon has ad vanced from a nominal rate of 18 and an actual one of 15 or 20 to an official 22 a week The carriage to a cemetery for which 5 was formerly charged now costs 7 The official scale of the Commission Team Owners was always charged like a uniform freight rate by the commission dealer to the shipper even when less than that scale was paid by the dealer to the teamowner In this case the new scale was made by agreement between the teamowners and the dealers and raised the cartage charges 10 to 100 per cent the average on the bulk of the business being about 30 per cent This scale and all others are placed at such figures that the teamowner whether member or nonmember who pays the union scale of wages cannot make a profit if he cuts the scale of cartage The scale cannot be exorbitant426 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS compared with the wages since merchants and manu facturers have the option of hiring their teamsters directly for the same wages and hours and running their own stables and many of them do so while others prefer to sell their horses and wagons and let out their teaming to contractors at the official scale It must be remem bered that a teaming contractor assumes the liabilities of a common carrier and a single accident to his cargo or a pedestrian may wipe off the profits of a year or even his entire capital In the former period of reckless com petition no margin was allowed for insurance against such catastrophes and the wholesale merchant who now pays the increased cartage to a teaming contractor pays for the assumption of a risk that formerly cost him noth ing and is usually overlooked when he does his own truck ing until the accident occurs In the case of fares and charges where the general public is concerned such as those for cabs express and furni ture moving the maximum scale is usually fixed by munic ipal ordinance and the changed conditions simply mean that the legal prices are charged whereas formerly they were undercut In the case of the charge of Parmelee the railway baggage express of 50 cents on trunks from stations there has been no increase since that was fixed by agreement with the railway companies Other ex pressmen have advanced their 25cent charges to 35 cents and their 35cent charges to 50 cents The municipal ordinance which formerly fixed the hire of cabs at 25 cents per passenger per mile now fixes it at 50 cents per trip per mile whether one passenger or two The economic basis which supports these official scales of cartage in competitive lines may be illustrated by the case of the furniture movers The van teamsters reported at the barn not later than 430 AM and went home at night when their work was finished The emTYPES OF AMERICAN LABOR ORGANIZATION 427 ployer not paying them for overtime and being at liberty to keep them as late at night as he pleased without extra cost often figured on doing a cheap job if the customer would delay the beginning until late in the afternoon and finishing late at night His labor cost for such a job was practically nothing and hence there was no bottom to prices One teamowner could not tell how low his com petitors would be willing to go neither could he tell how low he himself could afford to go Even his horses skeletonized by overtime did not set a certain minimum On two or three occasions the owners had attempted to form an association and to agree on a minimum scale of charges but their agreements were always broken by the temptation so easily offered to get the teamsters work for nothing and to give the customer the benefit of the exploitation When the teamsters organized and reduced their indefinite hours of 90 or more to a definite 60 a week with 25 cents an hour for overtime then the employer could see a solid foundation on which to main tain the prices agreed upon The result has been that the unscrupulous teamowner who beat his competitors by cheating and overworking his teamsters has not been able to continue in business as such and the other class of owners who regretted but could not remedy what some of them now describe as the actual slavery of the teamster are more prosperous than ever before Their horses and equipment are better cared for and their services to the public better performed True also the public pays higher charges for cartage than before but the complaint from that source has partly subsided In view of the facts their grievance is like that of the Roman populace when the gladiatorial combats were stopped The oneteam owner who drives his wagon has a peculiar and dubious place in this business He is the connecting428 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS link as it were between the ancient guild and the modern organizations of employers and workmen on class lines He is eligible either to the teamsters union or the team owners association As a member of the owners associa tion he is expected to observe the scale of cartage and as a member of the union the owners ask that he be made to observe that scale The policy of the unions on this point is to have less and less to do with regulating prices and therefore to leave the oneteam owner free to do as he pleases unless he employs a helper Of course he needs a button or a card in order to travel uninterrupted and this induces him to join one of the associations If he joins the truckowners he gets an association button which the teamsters recognize If he is an ice wagondriver he requires a helper and so is not eligible to the union but he is given a card certifying that he employs a union helper and is entitled to all courtesies and respect of members of the I B of T One of the locals the Express Drivers is composed solely of these oneteam owners Their charges are regulated by municipal ordinance on work done by the trip A wagon and driver are hired by the week at 24 They can work as many hours a day as they please since each is his own employer The interests of these small proprietors lead them into a field foreign to that of the ordinary labor union as may be seen in the legal activities of the Hack Coupe and Cab Drivers Since 1896 this local has expended 7000 in securing certain rights of common carriers Formerly abutting propertyowners including the railway compa nies leased the right to stand on the street in front of their property and the revenues of hotels from this seizure of the public highway amounted to 50 or 60 and in one case 200 a month The cabdrivers won a suit in the criminal courti and another in the Supreme Court of I City of Chicago v Wilson Chicago Legal News August 16 1902TYPES OF AMERICAN LABOR ORGANIZA TION 429 Illinois1 and now any driver can stand at any place on the streets designated by police authorities Next they contested the right to solicit passengers inside the depots and to stand on the line designated by the railroad au thorities for Parmelees drivers A railroad company secured an injunction in the United States Circuit Court and the union carried it to the Circuit Court of Appeals2 and then to the United States Supreme Court whence a decision is now awaited An interesting outcome of the change from indefinite to definite hours and wages as well as the separation of classes has been the breakdown of the fatherly feeling which some of the teamowners say they formerly had for some of their teamsters They learned to feel an interest in the men who had been in their service for many years and to share their sorrows and joys Though such a man was unfitted for other branches of work he was sat isfactory in his old position if he would accept a lower rate of pay and make himself generally useful Or the owner employed a boy at 1 a day out of regard for his widowed mother Now the union comes between the owner and his teamster It compels the owner to advance his pay by 3 or 6 a week to a minimum rate It re quires a higher rate for that overtime in which the teamster had shown his general usefulness The teamster takes his orders from the union and becomes a party to the coercion Estrangement follows The owner cannot af ford to keep the man or boy at the higher rates of pay He must have vigorous young men He has discharged the boys A large manufacturer has cut off the two weeks vacation on full pay which he formerly gave to his teamsters The bargain has lost its indefinite easy fatherly relation of giveandtake and has become a close calculation l Pennsylvania RR v City of Chicago 181 Ill 289 2Donovan et al v The Pennsylvania Co 116 Fed 907 120 Fed 215 1903430 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS A similar estrangement occcurs between the team owner and his customers the public The merchant or manufacturer formerly was willing to let the truckowner send an old man or a boy with the team which he got for a dollar or two less by the week on that account The small teamowner with inferior equipment formerly secured trade by making concessions in price Now he must have just as good a team just as large a wagon or just as attractive a van as his wealthy competitor in order to get the trade The public has lost its desire to help out the poor teamowner Its friendly feeling like the fatherly feeling of the teamowner disappears when no longer paid for Thus has the cash nexus of unionism uncovered and dislodged a certain amount of unconscious hypocrisy Naturally at first the teamowners were at sea in deal ing with the new situation Having lost the personal control of their teamsters it seemed to them that they must control the organization that had come between them But these organizations in turn seemed to be simply the union leaders and officers Consequently an era of corruption was ushered in and the employers turned over their funds to Driscoll a labor expert but not a teamowner who knew how to handle the leaders This continued as described above until the unions had time to learn selfgovernment and depose the leaders who assumed to sell and deliver them They also took from the business agents their vote though not their seat in the joint teamsters council The teamowners then per force changed their policy They deposed Driscoll and elected plain business men teamowners like them selves The policy of these men is what they describe as fair dealing They try to remedy every grievance open and aboveboard on its merits They realize that the teamowner who by a corrupt bargain with the union agent is not compelled to remedy the grievance of hisTYPES OF AMERICAN LABOR ORGANIZATION 431 teamster thereby has an advantage over his competitors Equal treatment is as necessary to preserve the team owners association as it is to preserve the teamsters union In this way they cultivate what they call a friendly feeling with the teamsters in place of the former paternal feeling This new kind of friendly feeling while severe on indi viduals here and there accords with the teamsters view of himself From what has already been said of his work and wages it follows that he is more than the mere un skilled laborer so generally assumed He is sometimes a travelling salesman and at least a travelling representa tive Even the ordinary teamster looks upon his occu pation as a craft and the object of his union is to have it recognized as such He like the salesman is really a man of the worldcomes in contact with many classes of people and learns to deal with men as well as handle material His work is a constant adaptation of means to ends in a struggle for business without the aid of a foreman to do his thinking He must know the depots the streets and the best routes He is intrusted with his employers property and his employers obligations as a common carrier both for goods hauled and pedestrians injured He often requires special attributes of carefulness and promptness The van teamster cites with professional pride the expensive furniture moved from a fashionable dwelling without a scratch The commission teamdriver feels his responsibility for perishable goods and for prompt and careful handling The garbage collector calls him self the sanitary teamster The helpers of the machinery and safemoving teamsters are millwrights Now the efforts of the teamsters to have these quali ties recognized as distinguishing a craft and not common to the mere laborer are seen in some of their policies First is the enforcement as far as possible of weekly432 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS salaries instead of payment by the load or laying a man off when work is interrupted This policy leads the employer to bunch his work better and to keep a man steadily employed in place of letting him hang around waiting for work Of course trade in some lines is sea sonal and allowance for this is made by classifying em ployees as steady men and extra drivers and helpers The latter in some cases are paid by the hour the livery  tripper  by 25 per cent of the liverymans charge They are considered as serving a kind of apprenticeship while for the  steady men  in slack times the old employee is to have the preference being the last laid off and the first taken on The closedshop policy also is justified as the protec tion of their craft against the  farmer  or the  hobo who can drive a wagon but is not a teamster As long too as the minimum wage can be maintained the teamowner is not inclined to employ these inexperienced and less reliable drivers That the hope of the teamster to make his calling a craft is being realized is borne out by the wit ness of teamowners who speak sometimes with enthusi asm of the superior character of the men who have come to the front The bums are gradually weeded out by the employers themselves Men of integrity and self respect secure the offices and the worldly wisdom of the teamster makes him amenable to reason and fair dealing He harbors no resentment on account of his former treat ment for he acknowledges that the teamowners were themselves victims of destructive competition Yet the employers do not feel that their sailing is smooth or the future certain The former defeated corruptionist and a few adroit employers still seeking to  tie up  a com petitor in business are able to foment occasional petty strikes and violations of agreements Equally serious are the enormous advances in wages and the selfconfident demands of the unions for more and still more and mostTYPES OF AMERICAN LABOR ORGANIZATION 433 serious of all is the prospect of sympathetic strikes on behalf of other unions unable to win on their own account It is evident that employers are understanding each other better and are preparing for united action Many of them consider the teamster as the keystone of Chicago unionism The freight tunnel now completed under all the downtown streets is expected to free them from an event like the freighthandlers strike But prediction would be vain J R COMMONS UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN

problems of contact discussed by STEINERt and HESSEt were in vestigated from a more general stanidpoint by CLEBSCH in his paper on the application of Abelian functions to geometry 4 A study of the groups of these geometrical problems has been made by JORDAN  One of the most in teresting of these groups was shown by JORDAN to be holoedrically isomorphic with the first hypoabelian linear group which plays so important a role in various geometrical questions and in the problem of the construction of all solvable groups As the proof Traite pp 229249 is quite complicated it seemed to the writer worth while to publish the elementary proof given below of the isomorphism in question No use will be made of the JORDAN substitu tions a1 f81  ap Bp neither the origin nor the interpretation of which is apparent 2 The theorem that there are 28 bitangents to a curve of the fourth order has been generalized by CLEBSCH 1 C  8 as follows Let C1 be a curve of order n having no double poilnts and set p   n  1 n  2 There are 2P1 2P  1 curves qf order n  3 having simple contact with C at lnn 3 points The determination of these curves depends upon an equation E of degree Rp a 221  2P1 whose

symbols xl y  y of  2 Hence Go is isomorphic with a substitutiongroup F on these R symnbols Moreover the isomorphism is holo edric and the group F is transitive these results are readily proved 4 We

Similarly A and N leave 03 and 4 invariant Hence GQ contains all the generators of r The next step consists in the proof that every substitution of GI belongs to r From the two results we may then conclude that G Fr so that G1 and the first hypoabelian group Go will be proved holoedrically isomorphic 5 Let L be an arbitrary substitution of G1 and denote by f1 the symbol which L replaces by 00 11 00  00 Then r being transitive contains a sub stitution L which replaces A by 00 11   00 Hence 3 LL will be long to G1 and will leave 00 11  00 fixed Since M does not alter 03 it American Journal

Hence P leaves in variant the function  of  5 derived from 4 and the following function derived from fV  1  2XIYI X2Y2 XY3  XI  l1 Y 2  lY2  1 x3y3   Hence P will permute amongst themselves the

there are 2203 such symbols satisfying the conditions p 7 xYi 1 x2y2 y1 1 mod 2 Among them occurs 01 11 00  00 We next prove that r contains a sub stitution T which leaves fixed 00 11   10 11   and

assume that every substitution which leaves fixed P1 OP1 is derived from the substitutions of rj1 the first hypoabelian group on p  1 pairs of indices and proceed to prove that every substitution

symbols 8 Let Q be the substitution derived from Q by retaining only the cycles on the q symbols Since Q leaves P1 and Pl invariant it belongs to rP by hypothesis We proceed to show that K9 QQ reduces to the identity so that the theorem will be proved Now JK leaves fixed every symbol 00 X2y2 x3x3  as well as 01 11 00  and 10 11 00  Hence it leaves fixed the fourth term of c4 in the products 00 11

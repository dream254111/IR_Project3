MacLeod named after Sir Thomas Gresham its English enunciator is of course well understood and has been thoroughly worked out Perhaps there is no better presentation of the various cases of the laws operation than that given by Gide in his  Political Economy At the same time the formulation of the law itself seems to have attracted too little attention I shall venture therefore to criticise one or two typical statements of the law and thereafter to offer what I consider an improved statement thereof The commonest formula is this  Bad money drives out good money but good money can not drive out bad money t Even Gide who is so explicit in regard to the various cases of the laws action puts it thus In every country where two legal moneys are in circu lation the bad money always drives out the good General Walker has criticised this phrasing of the law and has amended it First cit ing the current statement that bad money always drives out good money he remarks Thus boldly stated as in most treatises it is the theorem is false That effect will not be produced unless the body of money thus composed of heavy and light coins is itself in excess of the needs of the community as determined by the law of the terri torial distribution of money which has been stated and illustratedf General Walkers criticism is in point but his proposed amend ment is in my judgment defective first because by implication the laws operation is restricted to a circulation exclusively metallic and second because the law which is invoked of the international distri bution of money does not adequately cover all cases of the operation of Greshams law The first objection urged against General Walkers statement rests it is true largely upon verbal grounds Undoubtedly a careful reader of economics would argue analogically that a currency consisting partly of coin and partly of paper surrogates would obey the same law as a metal currency and that under the necessary con ditions paper money will be the bad money  and drive the better out of circulation But it is dangerous to assume that the ordinary undergraduate has the analogical judgment highly developed The positive genius sometimes displayed in misunderstanding a plain statement precludes one from assuming in the average reader much capacity for discrimination in the interpretation of economic laws  Pp 194198 Jacobsens

the fact that Greshams law may operate irrespective of movements of specie and bullion in foreign trade Suppose an absolutely isolated economic community with a joint metallic circulation and with constant addi tions being made to the stock of one of the money metals Ultimately the undervalued money will disappear from circulation So that the proposed addendum to wit as determined by the law of the terri torial distribution of money  is not an adequate limitation or expla nation of the shorter but misleading statement that bad money always drives out good The formulation of the law given in an old pamph let cited by MacLeod is much more cautious and on the whole nearer the truth It runs thus When two sorts of coin are current in the same nation of like value by denomination but not intrin sically that which has the least value will be current and the other as much as possible hoarded The dogmatic formulation however which seems to me the best and which I offer in order to avoid the difficulties attaching to the shorter but sometimes misleading statement of the theorem runs as follows When any element in the joint circulating medium of a country can be more advantageously employed in a nonmonetary use that element tends in whole or part to disappearfrom the domestic circulation Thus phrased the paradox of bad moneys driving out good money which is not always true disappears Instead of seeming a monetary mystery the truth is seen to be so simple that it seems almost a truism Thus put it is as true for an isolated economic community as for a nation engaged in international trade And lastly the real cause of the phenomenon comes to view in the increased utility of employing the erstwhile money to serve as a hard as raw material in the arts or a means of liquidating foreign indebtedness WINTHROP M DANIELS Princeton College VACATION COURSES IN POLITICS AND ECONOMICS AT BERLINt SIR In answer to your favor of the 27th ult I have the honor to reply as

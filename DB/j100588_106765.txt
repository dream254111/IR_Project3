J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,106765,SKETCHES AND DESCRIPTIONS OF THREE SIMPLE INSTRUMENTS FOR DRAWING ARCHITECTURE AND MACHINERY IN PERSPECTIVE BY MR JAMES PEACOCK COMMUNICATED BY ROBERT MYLNE ESQ FRS,I206942,366 XXII SKETCHES AND DESCRIPTIONS OF THREE SIMPLE INSTRUMENTS FOR DRAWING ARCHITECTURE AND MACHINERY IN PERSPECTIVE BY MR JAMES PEACOCK COMMUNICATED BY ROBERT MYLNE ESQ FRS READ MARCH 17 1785 SOME OF THE FOLLOWING MACHINES MUST BE PLACED UPON THE FRONT EDGE OF THE TABLE UPON WHICH THEY ARE TO STAND THE SIGHTS MAY BE SUPPORTED BY A THREELEGGED STAFF THE STOCKS OF THE SQUARES OR INDEXES MAY HAVE STEEL SPRINGS UPON THEIR EDGES IN ORDER TO KEEP THEM IN ANY ASSIGNED PART OF THE GROOVES IN WHICH THEY ARE TO SLIDE FIG  TAB XIII ABCD A DRAWING BOARD TO BE FIXED ON A TABLE OR STAND C IN A VERTICAL POSITION AB A SLIDINGPIECE FOR THE TOP OF THE T SQUARE HAVING A REBATE THEREIN TO FORM A GROOVE AS EXPRESSED BY THE DOTTED LINE CD SLIDINGPIECE FOR THE BOTTOM OF THE SQUARE HAVING A REBATE THEREIN TO FORM A GROOVE FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE STOCK AS DESCRIBED BY THE DOTTED LINE THIS SLIDINGPIECE TO BE OF SUFFICIENT LENGTH TO RECEIVE AND SUPPORT THE SAID STOCK WHEN THE BLADE OF THE SQUARE IS COINCIDENT WITH THE LINES KNFH OR LNGI E A HOLE TO RECEIVE THE ARM OR SLIDER OF THE SIGHTPIECE TO BE CONSTRUCTED IN THE USUAL MANNER FGHI AN OPENING FORMING THE FIELD OF VIEW FOR THE PROTOTYPE KLMN A SHEET OF PAPER FIXED ON THE UPPER PART OF THE BOARD FOR THE COPY THE FOUR INNER LINES WHEREOF FORM AND INCLOSE A SPACE OF THEMR PEACOCKS DESCRIPTIONS C 367 THE SAME DIMENSIONS AS THE FIELD OF VIEW RESPECTIVELY OP A STEEL SLIDINGPIECE EQUAL IN LENGTH TO THE DISTANCE KF OR IN AT THE LOWER END P IS A STEEL ARM TERMINATING IN A POINT AND AT THE UPPER END AT O IS A SIMILAR ARM TERMINATING WITH A BRASS BUTTON IN THE CENTER OF WHICH IS A SHARP STEEL PRICKER THE SAID PRICKER AND THE POINT P ARE TO BE EQUIDISTANT FROM THE EDGE OF THE BLADE OF THE SQUARE THIS ARM O IS TO HAVE THE FACULTY OF A SPRING IN ORDER THAT THE PRICKER MAY CLEAR ITSELF OF THE SURFACE OF THE PAPER AS SOON AS THE FINGER QUITS THE BUTTON IN THE SAME MAN NER AS IS USUAL IN THE APPARATUS OF LARGE PROTRACTORS THIS SLIDING STEELPIECE MAY BE DRAWN OUT OF THE DOVETAILED OR REBATED GROOVE AT PLEASURE AND THE T SQUARE WILL THEN BE FIT FOR ORDI NARY USES TO USE THE INSTRUMENT HAVING FIXED THE BOARD TRULY LEVEL AND PERPENDICULAR AND PLACED THE POINT OF SIGHT OR HOLE FOR VISION AT SUCH A HEIGHT AND DISTANCE AS SHALL BE PRODUCTIVE OF THE BEST EFFECT MOVE THE SQUARE WITH ONE HAND AND THE STEEL SLIDER WITH THE OTHER UNTIL THE POINT P COINCIDES WITH THE EYE AND ANY POINT OR ANGLE IN THE ORIGINAL OBJECT PRESS THE PRICKER AT O AND THE PUNCTURE WILL BE THE TRUE PLACE OR COPY OF SUCH ORIGINAL POINT OR ANGLE C N B ALL PERPENDICULAR LINES MAY BE DRAWN AT ONCE IN PENCIL BY BRINGING THE LEFTHAND EDGE OF THE SQUARE TO COIN CIDE WITH THE ORIGINAL LINE AND THE EYE AND THEIR LENGTHS MAY BE VERY NEARLY DETERMINED BY THE GRADUATED EDGE OF THE SQUARE SO AS TO PREVENT CONFUSION FROM UNNECESSARY LENGTHS OF LINES THE SAID GRADUATED EDGE WILL ALSO GIVE THE POINTS IN ALL CURVED OR IRREGULAR OBJECTS VOL LXXV C C C FIG368 MR PEACOCKS DESCRIPTIONS OF INSTRUMENTS FIG II TAB XIV AS THE INSTRUMENT FIG I PROCEEDS CHIEFLY BY FINDING THE PO SITIONS OF POINTS THIS IS CONTRIVED TO FIND THE POSITIONS OF LINES AND TO DETERMINE THEIR LIMITS BY THEIR RECIPROCAL INTERSECTIONS ABOCDE IS A COMPOUND BOARD TO BE PLACED IN A VERTICAL POSITION FGHI IS THE OPENING OR FIELD OF VIEW KLMN IS A LOOSE BOARD UPON WHICH PAPER IS TO BE FIXED AND THE EDGES OF THE SAID BOARD ARE TO BE REBATED AS DESCRIBED IN THE PLAN AT Z Z XYMN AND OPQR ARE GROOVED RECESSES TO RECEIVE THE SAID LOOSE BOARD AS OCCASION

PARALLELOGRAM INTO THE GROOVE AE OR ED TO CORRESPOND THEREWITH THEN BY MOVING THE STOCK IN THE GROOVE WITH ONE HAND AND AT THE SAME TIME REGULATING THE PARALLELORAM WITH THE OTHER THE TOP EDGE OF THE RULER UW MAY BE BROUGHT TO COINCIDE WITH ANY LINE IN THE ORIGINAL OBJECT AND THE FIGURED DIVISIONS ON THE EDGE OF THE RULER WILL AT THE SAME TIME DETERMINE THE LIMITS THEREOF NEAR ENOUGH TO AVOID A CONFUSION OF UNNECESSARY LENGTHS OF LINE C THE TRUE REPRE 4 SENTATIONFOR DRAWING IN PERSPECTIVE 369 SENTATION OF THE PLACE AND POSITION OF THE LINE MAY BE THEN DRAWN UPON THE PAPER BY THE TOP EDGE OF THE RULER ST A TRIFLE LONGER AT EACH EXTREMITY THAN IT APPEARS TO BE THIS OPERATION MAY BE REPEATED FOR AS MANY LINES AS CAN BE OBTAINED IN THE FIRST POSITION OF THE PAPERED BOARD AND PARALLELOGRAM WHEN THEY MUST BE SHIFTED INTO THE OTHER RECESS AND GROOVE TO FIND THE REST WHICH MAY BE NOW DONE WITHOUT TAKING ANY FURTHER NOTICE OF THE DIVISIONS ON THE RULERS N B A COMMON T SQUARE APPLIED TO A BOARD OF THIS KIND WILL ANSWER MOST PURPOSES FOR EXAMPLE PLACE THE STOCK OF SUCH A SQUARE IN ONE OF THE GROOVES HAVING A BLADE NOT LESS THAN THE LENGTH HK OR HR MARK THE SPACES HI AND QR UPON THE UPPER EDGE THEREOF AND DIVIDE EACH OF THEM INTO ANY CONVENIENT NUMBER OF EQUAL PARTS AND FIGURE THE SAID PARTS IN THE USUAL MANNER TO CORRESPOND WITH EACH OTHER AS MAY BE SEEN IN FIG I NOW SUPPOSE THE STOCK OF THE SQUARE TO BE IN ED IT IS PLAIN THAT ALL PERPENDICULAR LINES MAY BE DRAWN UPON THE PAPER KLMN IN THEIR PROPER PLACES AND BY MEANS OF THE DIVISIONS ON THE EDGE OF THE SQUARE NEARLY OF THOUGH PROPERLY A TRIFLE MORE THAN THEIR TRUE LENGTH ALL THE LINES OF THIS DESCRIPTION BEING OBTAINED THE SHIFTING BOARD MUST BE PLACED IN ITS OTHER RECESS AND THE STOCK OF THE SQUARE INTO THE OTHER GROOVE THEN BEGINNING WITH THE FIRST LINE BRING THE EDGE OF THE SQUARE TO AGREE WITH ITS LIMITS AND MARK THEM OFF UPON THE LINE ON THE PAPER AND SO OF ALL THE REST IN SUCCESSION AND JOIN THE POINTS WHERE NECESSARY WITH A COMMON RULER FIG III TAB XIV THIS APPARATUS IS CONTRIVED TO AVOID THE TROUBLE OF CONTI NUALLY WORKING AGAINST A BOARD IN A VERTICAL POSITION IN ORDER C C C 2 TO370 MR PEACOCKS DESCRIPTIONS OF INSTRUMENTS TO THIS TWO SQUARE BOARDS ARE TO BE PROVIDED EQUAL IN SIZE AND OF SIMILAR CONSTRUCTION ONE IS TO BE FIXED IN A VERTICAL POSITION FOR VIEWING THE ORIGINAL OBJECT THROUGH A

INVOLVING THIS STATUTE WAS LOOKED FOR WITH NO LITTLE INTEREST THE KANSAS COURT HAD UPHELD A CONVICTION UNDER THE STATUTE 2 AND THE CASE WAS CARRIED TO THE SUPREME COURT ON THE GROUND THAT THE STATUTE VIOLATED THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT FORBIDDING ANY STATE TO PASS OR ENFORCE A LAW DEPRIVING ANY PERSON OF LIFE LIBERTY OR PROPERTY WITHOUT DUE PROCESS OF LAW MANY STATES HAVE PASSED STATUTES MAKING IT CRIMINAL FOR AN EM PLOYER TO DISCHARGE AN EMPLOYEE BECAUSE OF MEMBERSHIP IN A LABOR UNION AND IN 1898 CONGRESS PASSED A LAW TO THE SAME EFFECT APPLY ING TO INTERSTATE RAILROADS AND THEIR EMPLOYEES THESE STATUTES HAVE BEEN DECLARED UNCONSTITUTIONAL WITH PRACTICAL UNANIMITY THE KAN SAS COURT ITSELF SO HELD IN A COMPARATIVELY RECENT DECISION 4 AND THE ACT OF CONGRESS WAS DENIED EFFECT IN THE WELLKNOWN CASE OF ADAIR V UNITED STATES5 BECAUSE IT VIOLATED THE FIFTH AMENDMENT TO THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION THOSE WHO ATTACKED THE RECENT KANSAS STAT UTE INVOLVED IN THE COPPAGE CASE ARGUED THAT THE ADAIR CASE AND THE OTHER DECISIONS SHOULD GOVERN IT ON THE OTHER HAND IT WAS STRONGLY CONTENDED THAT THE TWO CASES WERE TO BE DISTINGUISHED BE CAUSE OF VITAL DIFFERENCES WHILE AT LEAST ONE OF THE JUSTICES ADVO CATED OVERRULING THE ADAIR CASE BUT THE LASTNAMED COURSE SEEMS NOT TO HAVE BEEN INSISTED UPON NOR SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED HENCE THE FIRST QUESTION TO BE DECIDED BY THE COURT WAS WHETHER THE VALID ITY OF THE TWO STATUTES WAS TO BE GOVERNED BY THE SAME CONSIDERA TIONSTHE ONE FORBIDDING DISCHARGE BECAUSE OF UNION AFFILIATIONS AND THE OTHER FORBIDDING THE PARTIES MAKING NONMEMBERSHIP A CON DITION OF THE EMPLOYMENT IN REGARD TO THE FIRST OF THESE PROVISIONS IT IS ALMOST UNIVERSALLY ADMITTED THAT WHERE THE EMPLOYMENT IS AT WILL IT CAN BE TERMINATED AT ANY TIME AT THE WHIM OF EITHER PARTY FOR ANY CAUSE OR FOR NO CAUSE WHATEVER AND SINCE IT CAN BE TERMINATED BY EITHER PARTY FOR ANY CAUSE IT CAN BE TERMINATED BY THE EMPLOYER BECAUSE OF THE OTHER PARTYS AFFILIATION WITH A UNION6 BUT IT IS ARGUED THAT WHERE THE EMPLOYEE IS ASKED TO AGREE IN ADVANCE TO WITHDRAW FROM HIS UNION OR NOT TO JOIN ONE DURING THE LIFE OF THE CONTRACT HE IS BEING ASKED TO SIGN AWAY A RIGHT WHICH IS GUARANTEED TO

BUT THE EXERCISE OF THIS RIGHT IS NOT OF SUCH TRANSCENDING IMPORTANCE TO THE STATE THAT IT IS AGAINST PUBLIC POLICY TO ALLOW ONE OF ITS MEMBERS TO FOREGO IT TEMPORARILY NOR DOES THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION GUARANTEE ITS FREE EXERCISE AGAINST DANGER FROM THE PARTYS OWN FOLLY IN SIGN ING IT AWAY NOR EVEN AGAINST ADVERSE ACTS OF OTHER INDIVIDUALS BUT SOLELY AS AGAINST RESTRICTIVE STATE LAWS BUT IN THE INSTANT CASE THE PARTY WAS GIVEN THE CHOICE OF SIGNING THE AGREEMENT OR REFUSING THE PARTICULAR EMPLOYMENT OFFERED TO HIM ON THAT CONDITION BUT IT IS SUBMITTED THAT PRACTICALLY EVERY CONTRACT AND ESPECIALLY EVERY CONTRACT OF SERVICE INVOLVES THE GIVING UP OF CERTAIN RIGHTS IN FACT AS POINTED OUT BY MR JUSTICE PITNEY IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW THE RIGHT OF MAKING CONTRACTS CAN BE ENJOYED AT ALL EXCEPT BY PAR TIES COMING TOGETHER IN AN AGREEMENT THAT REQUIRES EACH PARTY TO FOREGO DURING THE TIME AND FOR THE PURPOSE COVERED BY THE AGREE MENT ANY INCONSISTENT EXERCISE OF HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS 7 AN ILLUSTRATION OF A VERY COMMON AGREEMENT TO FOREGO THE EX ERCISE OF SUCH RIGHTS AS A PART OF CONTRACTS OF EMPLOYMENT WILL SERVE TO MAKE THIS CLEARER8 THUS AS THE COURT SAID WHILE EVERYONE HAS A RIGHT TO BE IDLE OR TO WORK FOR WHOMSOEVER HE PLEASES THE OTHER PARTY BEING WILLING YET IT IS AN EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITION OF EVERY CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT THAT THE EMPLOYEE WILL NOT BE IDLE AND WILL NOT WORK FOR OTHERS SO LONG AS HE IS IN THE SERVICE OF HIS PRESENT EMPLOYER OR TO TAKE ANOTHER EXAMPLE MORE CLEARLY ANALOGOUS TO THE PRINCIPAL CASE NO ONE DOUBTS THAT A RELIGIOUS CONGREGATION IN COPPAGE V KANSAS 35 SUP CT 240 243 PRINCIPAL CASE IT IS SUBMITTED THAT THE ANALOGY WHICH MR JUSTICE DAY DRAWS BE TWEEN THIS CASE AND THE CASE OF A STATE STATUTE REQUIRING A FOREIGN COR PORATION TO AGREE NOT TO REMOVE A CASE TO THE FEDERAL COURTS IS FAR FROM BEING A PERFECT ANALOGY AS HE POINTS OUT IT HAS BEEN HELD THAT THOUGH A STATE HAS THE RIGHT TO EXCLUDE A FOREIGN CORPORATION BE CAUSE OF ITS THUS REMOVING A CASE YET IT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL FOR A STATE TO PASS A LAW BY WHICH IT REFUSES TO ADMIT A FOREIGN CORPORATION EX CEPT ON CONDITION THAT IT SIGN AN AGREEMENT NOT TO REMOVE A CASE TO THE FEDERAL COURTS THE FOLLOWING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO CASES MIGHT BE POINTED OUT IN THE FIRST PLACE THE CONSTITUTION GIVES THE FOREIGN CORPORATION THE RIGHT TO REMOVE ITS CASES TO THE FEDERAL FORUM AND IT FURTHER BY THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT FORBIDS A STATE TO PASS ANY LAW DEPRIVING ANY PERSON NATURAL OR ARTIFICIAL OF ITS LIBERTY WITH CUT DUE PROCESS OF LAW BUT THOUGH IT IS A PART OF THE EMPLOYEES LIB ERTY TO JOIN A UNION YET THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT DOES NOT PROTECT THIS RIGHT FROM OTHER INDIVIDUALS FOR INSTANCE EMPLOYERS BUT IT PRO TECTS IT ONLY FROM INTERFERENCE BY STATE LAWS NOT ONLY DOES THIS AMENDMENT NOT PROTECT THE EMPLOYEES RIGHT AGAINST INTERFERENCE BY THE EMPLOYER BUT IT ACTUALLY DOES PROTECT THE EMPLOYERS FREEDOM OF CON TRACT FROM RESTRICTIVE LAWS PASSED BY THE STATE LEGISLATURE SUCH AS IS FOUND IN THE KANSAS STATUTE IN ADDITION TO THIS STRICTLY LEGAL DIFFER ENCE BETWEEN THE TWO CASES IT MIGHT ALSO BE REGARDED AS AGAINST PUBLIC POLICY FOR A STATE ARBITRARILY TO RESTRICT THE JURISDICTION OF THE FEDERAL COURTS WHILE THERE IS NO QUESTION OF PUBLIC POLICY INVOLVED IN THE KAN SAS CASE FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE RIGHT OF A STATE TO PREVENT A FOR EIGN CORPORATION FROM REMOVING CAUSES TO THE FEDERAL COURTS SEE 2 VA LAW REV 288 542EMPLOYING A MINISTER HAS A RIGHT TO MAKE IT A CONDITION OF THE CONTRACT THAT HE PLEDGE HIS HONORAS THE KANSAS COURT SAID OF THIS CASENOT TO JOIN A CONGREGATION OF ANOTHER FAITH WHILE IN ITS EMPLOYMENT ALTHOUGH THAT WOULD BE AN ACT WHICH HE WOULD HAVE A PERFECT LEGAL RIGHT TO DO AND IN FACT IS ONE WHICH IS MOST JEALOUSLY GUARDED BY OUR CONSTITUTIONS DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND THE BILLS OF RIGHTS OF PRACTICALLY ALL THE STATES IF IN EITHER OF THESE CASES THE CONDITIONS DEMANDED WERE ARBITRARY OR HAD NO REASONABLE CONNECTION WITH THE PRINCIPAL CONTRACT THERE MIGHT BE SOME SHOW OF REASON IN FORBIDDING SUCH A CONDITION THOUGH IT WOULD BE HARD TO JUSTIFY EVEN THEN BUT OWING TO THE DANGER OF STRIKES AND OTHER LABOR TROUBLES WHERE UNION MEN ARE EMPLOYED AN EMPLOYER WHOSE BUSINESS WOULD SUFFER GREATLY EVEN FROM A SLIGHT CESSATION MIGHT REASONABLY CONSIDER IT VERY ESSENTIAL TO GUARD AGAINST SUCH DANGERS IN THE VERY INCEPTION OF THE CONTRACT RATHER THAN BE FORCED TO RELY UPON HIS UNDOUBTED RIGHT OF DISCHARGE WHEN HE FINDS THAT HIS EMPLOYEE HAS ALREADY JOINED A UNION AT LEAST IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE APPARENT RELATION BETWEEN MEMBERSHIP IN THE UNION AND THE SERVICES EXPECTED IS DIRECT ENOUGH TO PREVENT A COURTS SAYING THAT THERE IS NO RELATION AT ALL THE STRENGTH AND IMPORTANCE OF THE RELATION WOULD SEEM TO BE A QUESTION FOR THE DE CISION OF THE EMPLOYER AND HE SHOULD HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF DECIDING WHETHER UNION MEMBERSHIP IS CONSISTENT WITH THE DUTIES WHICH HE HAS A RIGHT TO ASK OF HIS EMPLOYEE IF IT BE TRUE THAT HE SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO A DECISION OF THIS QUESTION IT IS CERTAINLY OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE THAT EVERY CONSIDERATION OF HONEST DEALING DEMANDS THAT THE QUESTION BE SETTLED AT THE INCEPTION OF THE CONTRACT RATHER THAN THAT THIS IMPORTANT CONDITION BE KEPT CONCEALED AND THE WORKMAN BE DISMISSED SUMMARILY AFTER HAVING JOINED A UNION THE FIRST COURSE SEEMS TO BE THE FAIRER TO BOTH PARTIES AND DECIDEDLY THE MORE FAVOR ABLE TO THE EMPLOYEE BUT WHICHEVER THE EMPLOYEE MAY CONSIDER MORE FAVORABLE TO HIMSELF THE SUPREME COURT COMES TO THIS CON CLUSION THAT UNDER CONSTITUTIONAL FREEDOM OF CONTRACT WHATEVER EITHER PARTY HAS THE RIGHT TO TREAT AS SUFFICIENT GROUND FOR TERMINAT ING THE EMPLOYMENT WHERE THERE IS NO STIPULATION ON THE SUBJECT HE HAS THE RIGHT TO PROVIDE AGAINST BY INSISTING THAT A STIPULATION RE SPECTING IT SHALL BE A SINE QUA NON OF THE INCEPTION OF THE EMPLOY MENT OR OF ITS CONTINUANCE IF IT BE TERMINABLE AT WILL IT FOLLOWS THAT THIS CASE CANNOT BE DISTINGUISHED FROM ADAIR V UNITED STATES 9 AFTER REACHINGTHE CONCLUSION THAT THERE IS NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE TWO CASES THE COURT PROCEEDS AS IT SAYS TO RESTATE THE GROUNDS UPON WHICH THE FIRST DECISION RESTS IT IS OF COURSE FUNDAMENTAL THAT THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION FORBIDS ANY STATE TO DENY TO ANY PERSON LIFE LIBERTY OR PROPERTY WITHOUT DUE PROCESS OF LAW IN CLUDED IN THE RIGHT OF PERSONAL LIBERTY AND THE RIGHT OF PRIVATE PROP ERTY IS THE RIGHT TO MAKE CONTRACTS FOR THE ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY IT IS PROBABLY TRUE THAT OF ALL THE CONTRACTS THUS PROTECTED THE ONE WHICH HAS THE MOST PERSONAL RELATION TO THE GREATEST NUMBER OF MEN 9 COPPAGE V KANSAS 35 SUP CT 240 243 PRINCIPAL CASE NOTES 543VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW AND WHICH SHOULD BE MOST ADEQUATELY PROTECTED IS THE CONTRACT OF PERSONAL EMPLOYMENT BUT HOWEVER SACRED THE RIGHT OF CONTRACT IS THE COURTS HAVE CONSTRUED IT TO BE ALWAYS SUBJECT TO THE POLICE POWER OF THE STATE 10 AND THIS IS THE ONLY WAY IN WHICH ANY SUCH INTERFER ENCE WITH THIS FREEDOM AS IS FOUND IN THIS STATUTE IS TO BE JUSTIFIED THE COURTS HAVE DECLINED TO OUTLINE THE PRECISE LIMITS OF THIS VAGUE ATTRIBUTE OF SOVEREIGNTY KNOWN AS THE POLICE POWER SINCE IT IS ALWAYS EASIER TO DETERMINE WHETHER A PARTICULAR CASE COMES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE POWER THAN TO GIVE AN ABSTRACT DEFINITION OF THE POWER ITSELF WHICH WILL BE IN ALL RESPECTS ACCURATE 11 THERE IS AN EVERLURKING DANGER TO THE RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES OF THE CITIZEN IN THE APPLICATION OF THE VERY LOOSE TERMS OFTEN USED TO DESCRIBE ITS SCOPE EVEN WHERE IT IS PROPERLY LIMITED AND DEFINED IT IS SO FARREACHING AND POWERFUL AS AGAINST THE RIGHTS GUARANTEED BY THE CONSTITUTION THAT ITS ENLARGEMENT BY LOOSE APPLICATION OF THE TERM TO LEGISLATION WITH WHICH IT HAS NO REAL RELATION CONSTITUTES A VERY SERIOUS MEN ACE TO GUARANTEED PERSONAL FREEDOM AND CHERISHED RIGHTS THE COURTS HAVE AGREED THAT BEYOND THE FUNDAMENTAL EXERCISE OF THIS POWER FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THE STATE ITSELF IT MAY FURTHER PROP ERLY BE EXERCISED FOR PRESERVING THE PUBLIC HEALTH SAFETY MORALS OR THE GENERAL WELFARE AND THAT FOR THE PURPOSES INDICATED POLICE REG ULATIONS MAY LIMIT TO A REASONABLE DEGREE THE PERSONAL FREEDOM OF THE INDIVIDUAL WHICH INCLUDES THE FREEDOM OF CONTRACT12 OF THE LAWS WHICH HAVE BEEN UPHELD AS AN EXERCISE OF THE POLICE POWER THOUGH RESTRICTING FREEDOM OF CONTRACT THERE ARE NUMEROUS ILLUS TRATIONS THUS LAWS LIMITING THE HOURS OF LABOR IN DANGEROUS EM PLOYMENTS13 AND LAWS LIMITING THE HOURS OF LABOR OF WOMEN 14 HAVE BEEN UPHELD AS PROTECTING THE PUBLIC HEALTH A STATUTE PROHIBITING THE SALE OF LOTTERY TICKETS HAS BEEN UPHELD AS PROTECTING THE PUBLIC MORALS15 A RECENT STATUTE REQUIRING STATE BANKING CORPORATIONS TO CONTRIBUTE TO A DEPOSIT GUARANTY FUND HAS BEEN UPHELD AS A MEASURE REASONABLY RESTRICTING FREEDOM OF CONTRACT IN PROTECTION OF THE PUB LIC WELFARE16 THERE ARE VARIOUS OTHER STATUTES WHICH HAVE BEEN ATTACKED ON THIS SAME GROUND AND DECLARED VALID IN SPITE OF SUCH RE STRICTION BUT IN EVERY ONE OF THEM THE RESTRICTIVE REGULATIONS HAVE BEEN SUCH AS COULD FAIRLY BE DEEMED NECESSARY TO SECURE SOME OB JECT DIRECTLY AFFECTING THE PRESERVATION OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SAFETY MORALS OR WELFARE EVEN THOUGH THE ENJOYMENT OF PRIVATE RIGHTS OF LIBERTY AND PROPERTY BE THEREBY INCIDENTALLY HAMPERED IN FACT THE SUPREME COURT HAS ALWAYS BEEN RELUCTANT TO INVALIDATE

MATTER OF LEGISLATIVE JUDGMENT AND THE SCOPE OF THE JUDICIAL REVIEW IS CONFINED TO THE ACTUAL POWER OF THE LEGISLATURE AND DOES NOT EXTEND TO A CONSIDERATION OF THE WISDOM OR SOUND POLICY OF THE REGULATIONS17 THIS COURSE THE COURT PURSUED IN THE INSTANT CASE AND SOUGHT TO FIND SOME JUSTIFICATION FOR THE DRASTIC STATUTE INVOLVED BUT IT TOOK THE VIEW THAT THOUGH THE PROFESSED PURPOSE OF THE STATUTE WAS TO PROTECT EMPLOYEES FROM OPPRESSION AND COERCION THIS WAS NOT THE ACTUAL EFFECT OF ITS OPERATION PARTICULARLY AS APPLIED BY THE KANSAS COURTS IN THE PRESENT CASE THIS WAS MADE CLEAR BY THE FACT THAT AN EMPLOYER WAS SUBJECTED TO THE SAME PENALTY FOR MERELY OFFERING A PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYEE A FREE CHOICE TO SIGN THE AGREEMENT OR REFUSE THE EMPLOYMENT AS HE WOULD BE SUBJECT TO WERE HE ACTUALLY TO COERCE HIM INTO SIGNING IT BY THE MOST OPPRESSIVE PRACTICES HENCE THE COURT WAS JUSTIFIED IN GOING BELOW THE DECLARED PURPOSE OF THE STAT UTE AND EXAMINING INTO ITS ACTUAL OPERATION AFTER DISPOSING OF THE QUESTION OF COERCION THE COURT SEEKS TO FIND SOME OTHER EXERCISE OF THE POLICE POWER IN THE STATUTE WHILE IT HAS LONG BEEN SETTLED THAT THE LABOR UNION IS A LEGAL VOLUNTARY ORGANIZATION NO REASON CAN BE SUGGESTED WHY IT OF ALL VOLUNTARY ASSOCIATIONS SHOULD BE SINGLED OUT AS THE OBJECT OF THE LAWS SPECIAL FAVOR AT THE EXPENSE BOTH OF THE EMPLOYER AND OF WORKMEN WHO ARE NOT UNIONISTS FOR IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT THERE IS OFTEN MORE BITTER STRIFE BETWEEN UNIONIST AND NONUNIONIST THAN BETWEEN UNIONIST AND EMPLOYER AND THE NONUNIONIST HAS AS MUCH CLAIM TO PROTECTION BY THE STATE AS HIS FELLOW WORKMAN AS IS WELL SAID THE LABOR UNIONS ARE NOT PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS CHARGED BY LAW WITH PUBLIC OR GOVERNMENTAL DUTIES SUCH AS WOULD RENDER A MAINTENANCE OF THEIR MEMBERSHIP A MATTER OF DIRECT CONCERN TO THE PUBLIC WELFARE 18 HOW THEN CAN SUCH RESTRICTIVE LEGISLATION BE BROUGHT WITHIN THE POLICE POWER THE KANSAS COURT TOOK THE POSITION THAT SUCH LEGIS LATION WAS JUSTIFIED IN ORDER TO MAKE EMPLOYEES AS INDEPENDENT IN THE MAKING OF LABOR CONTRACTS AS IS THE EMPLOYER IN OTHER WORDS TO SMOOTH DOWN THE INEQUALITIES BETWEEN THEM BUT AS POINTED OUT BY MR JUSTICE PITNEY IT IS EVIDENT THAT THESE INEQUALITIES ARE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT INEVITABLE UNDER ANY SYSTEM OF PRIVATE PROPERTY AND UNLESS ALL PROPERTY IS HELD IN COMMON THEY SPRING UP FROM THE IN HERENT DIFFERENCE IN THE SKILL AND CAPACITY OF DIFFERENT MEN UNDER OUR THEORY OF GOVERNMENT IT IS NO PART OF THE FUNCTION OF THE STATE TO EQUALIZE MENS FORTUNES AND SUCH AN OBJECT CANNOT BE JUSTIFIED AS BEING IN BEHALF OF THE GENERAL WELFARE WHAT OUR WHOLE SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT AIMS AT IN THIS SPHERE IS TO GUARANTEE AS FAR AS POS SIBLE THE NORMAL EXERCISE OF FREEDOM OF CONTRACT AND OTHER RIGHTS OF PROPERTY AND THESE CAN BE INTERFERED WITH ONLY WHEN REASONABLY NECESSARY TO THE CARRYING OUT OF SOME PARAMOUNT PURPOSE WHICH 17 ERIE R CO V WILLIAMS 233 U S 685 CHICAGO B  Q R R CO V MCGUIRE SUPRA HOLDEN V HARDY SUPRA 8

FOUNDING OF THE NATION THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL OF NULLIFICATION WAS AIMED ONLY AT ACTS OF CONGRESS BUT THE ADVOCATES OF THIS DOCTRINE ARE FAR BOLDER AND SEEK TO NULLIFY THE CONSTITUTION ITSELF IF THE FACT THAT SUCH LEGISLATION WAS PASSED BY A STATE MAY BE TAKEN TO RAISE ANY PROBLEM FOR SOLUTION THE KANSAS COURT SEEMS IN ADVERTENTLY TO HAVE FURNISHED THE KEY TO THE SITUATION IN THE FOLLOW ING WORDS IF EXPERIENCE AND CHANGED CONDITIONS DEMONSTRATE THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS WORK OR PERMIT INJUSTICE THERE IS STILL A REMEDY BUT IT IS NOT IN THE COURTS 19 IF THERE IS A POPULAR BELIEF IN A SOCIALISTIC FORM OF GOVERNMENT WHICH DEMANDS A COM PLETE SURRENDER OF INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY AND THIS BELIEF IS STRONG ENOUGH AND GENERAL ENOUGH TO INDUCE THE PEOPLE TO TURN OVER THEIR LIBERTY TO THE LEGISLATURE THEN THERE WILL BE AMPLE AUTHORITY FOR EQUALIZING LEGISLATION AND THE COURTS WILL HAVE TO ENFORCE IT BUT UNTIL THE CON STITUTION IS AMENDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS SOCIALISTIC THEORY THE PRESENT THEORY OF GOVERNMENT WHICH HAS DOMINATED IT SINCE THE BE GINNING MUST CONTROL AND IT IS THE HIGHEST DUTY OF THE AMERICAN COURTS TO ENFORCE ITS LIMITATIONS AGAINST THE ENCROACHMENTS OF THE LEGISLATURES BOTH STATE AND NATIONAL FOR WHILE THE JUDICIARY IS NOT THE GUARDIAN OF CIVIL RIGHTS OR LIBERTY IN THE ABSTRACT IT IS THE GUARDIAN OF SO MUCH THEREOF AS BY CONSTITUTIONAL RESTRICTIONS THE GOVERNMENT IS FORBIDDEN TO DISTURB IN TAKING THIS VIEW OF THE QUESTION THERE IS NOT AND THERE IS NOT INTENDED TO BE ANY HOSTILITY OR ILLWILL TOWARD WORKINGMEN OR LABOR ORGANIZATIONS IN CONSIDERING LEGISLATION OF THIS KIND IT IS ALWAYS OF PRIME IMPORTANCE TO KEEP IN MIND THE FACT THAT THE SITUATION PRE SENTED IS PROBABLY A TRANSITORY ONE AND THAT ALMOST OVERNIGHT THE COURTS ARE LIABLE TO BE CONFRONTED WITH A STATUTE IMPOSING A SIMILAR CRIMINAL LIABILITY ON THE UNIONIST IN FAVOR OF THE EMPLOYER OR IN FA VOR OF THE NONUNIONIST IF THE POWER OF THE STATE TO PASS THIS RE STRICTIVE LEGISLATION BE SUSTAINED IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE QUESTION WHETHER THE ONE CLASS OR THE OTHER WOULD BE BEARING THE BURDEN AT ANY ONE TIME WOULD DEPEND MERELY ON WHICH OF THE CLASSES HAD THE UPPER HAND IN THE GOVERNMENT AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME THUS IF SUCH LAWS WERE SUSTAINED SOON THERE WOULD PROBABLY BE LEGISLATION IN SOME STATES FORBIDDING AN EMPLOYEE TO MAKE IT A CONDITION OF HIS EMPLOYMENT THAT THE EMPLOYER NOT JOIN A BLACKLISTING ORGANIZATION OR THAT HE NOT EMPLOY UNION MEN SUCH LEGISLATION WOULD NOT ONLY BE POSSIBLE BUT PROBABLE IN STATES WHERE THE UNIONISTS HAVE THE LEAST INFLUENCE IN

DOMICIL SIMILAR TO THE CONTROL OF THE WARDS PERSON AND PROPERTY ALLOWING THE COMMITTEE OR GUARDIAN FULL DISCRETION IN FACT SUBSTITUTING THE WILL OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE WILL OF THE WARD IN THE

PROPERTY A POWER NOT FULLY GUARDED BY THE MERE REQUIRE MENT OF GOOD FAITH2 OR BY REASON OF THE LOSS OF POWER BY THE COM MITTEE ATTENDANT UPON A CHANGE OF JURISDICTION3 THE OTHER VIEW WHICH IS BETTER

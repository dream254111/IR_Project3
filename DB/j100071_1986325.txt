paper is to bring together several points connected with the general theory of correspondences and continuous groups and to apply them to the theory of screws Although the several results are in general not new it seems of interest to give the accompanying presentation of the subject as it furnishes an excellent examiple of the way in which the theory of continuous groups underlies the whole theory of correspondences t The first section is devoted to general theory Use is made of the theorem of LIE j that if we have a continuous group in n variables together with an invariant equation system inlvolving m paramneters then a group of the parame ters exists which is isomorphic with the given group and it is pointed out that this theorem is fundamental iii all correspondences  The correspondence established is that between a PM and a P n Contact transformationl is the par ticular case when mn  n The screw geometry is developed from the projective group in three dimen sions together with the system of equations which define a general straight line The general theory leads at once to two important results in conniection with the theory of groups 1 The genercal continuous confornmal group in fourc dimensions is simply isomorphic with the generalprojective group in three 2 Both these groups are simply isomorphic with the continuous projective group infive dinmensions which leaves a given quadric invariant There follows an imnmediate generalization of part of the second theorem We have in fact the following 3 The general conformal group in space of n dimensions is simply isomor phic with the projective group in space of n  1 dimensions which preserves a given quadric These three results are due to KLEIN Some slight differences appear  Presented to the Society

example our conformal group does not include inversions The theory leads naturally to KLEINS  correspondence between linear comiplexes and hyperspheres and the properties of that correspondence are developed by a priori reasoning The spherestraight line correspondence of LIE also appears in the niatural course of development The major part of the remainder of the paper is concerned with the corresponidence shown to exist between points in space of five dimensions anld screws With respect to particular results we may mention that reciprocal screws become conjugate points with respect to the fundamental quadric and that the process of finding the resultant of any number of wrenches on given screws is shown to be equivalent to the process of finding the mass centre of given masses at given points in the five dimensional space The following notation is used throughout Pm denotes a linear m dimen sional manifold in ordinary space of any dimensions S8 deniotes a hypersphere of m dimensions in ordinary space of any ditmensions A quadric  is a locus satisfying an equation of the second degree in anly space 1 Let 7 fix  ns  a ai a n be the finite equations of a continuous group

ylp  provided the Os in the unaccented variables vanish The general theory of groups shows that the transformations for the ys form a group which is isomor phic with the originial one This group need not necessarily be of the same order as the original one Consider for example the general linear group n xiZ E xaij i  in conjunction with the equation system  KLEIN Mathematische Annalen vol 5 1872 p

ys the general projective group in n  1  dimensions is only of order n2  1 Let Xf denote any infinitesimal operator of the x group and Yf the corres ponding operator of the y group then the structure constants are the same for the two cases but there may be linear relations between the operators of the y group In any case the equations 0  0 form an invariant equation system for the group whose operators are X  Yf and this grouip is isomorphic with both the x and y groups The general conidition for simple isomorphism is readily obtained Suppose that the y group is of order r  h then there must exist h infinitesimial trans folrmatiolns of the x group which transform the system OtsXi st Y1  Yin  0 p into the system 4s X  Xn I Yi Ym   There must thus exist a suJbgroup of the x group for which the equations  0 form an invariant system for all values of the ys For instance in the case considered xw Xx is such a subgroup of the general linear group Now consider any manifold of n diinensions and let any eleinent in it be deter mined by x1  xn Consider also any manifold of m dimensions in which an element is determined by y1   y Then we say that a correspondence exists between the two manifolds such that to ani element of the first corresponds a certain locus in the second and vice versa We can say that the x and y groups correspond and in fact the importance of the correspondence depends largely oln these groups For example commencing with the ordinary projective group in space of three dimensions we may take the equation x3  xlyl  x2Y2  y3 as the equation system  0 We thus establish a correspondence between points in the space y and planes in the space x Now planes in the space x passinig through a given line are transformed by the x group into planes passing through another line This condition must be an invariant one for points in the y space We see therefore that points y lying on a line transform into points lying on a line Also the cross ratio of four x planes through a given line is invariant under all transformations of the x group and hence the cross ratio of four y points lying on a line is invariant under all transformations of the y group The y group is in fact also projective This idea may be immedi ately applied to the general case and we see that any relation among different x loci gives an invariant relation among the corresponding y points and con versely It is immediately obvious that the correspondence considered is a generalization of a contact transformation The Lie transformation of straight394 J E WRIGHT CORRESPONDENCES AND THEORY OF GROUPS July lines into spheres gives a good idea of the importance of the underlying group WATe mention two theorems 1 There are 15 infinitesimal contact transformations of spheres into spheres and there are 15 infinitesimal transformations of straight lines into straight lines Each of these sets forms a group and the two groups are simply isomorphic 2 There are 10 infinitesimal point transformations of spheres and there are ten infinitesimal transformations of straight lines into straight lines which leave a given linear complex invariant The two groups are again simply isomorphic 2 We commence with the projective group in space This group leaves invar iant the fanmily of all straight lines We take for the equations  0 the two xl Y1X3  Y3 32  Y2X3  Y4 This gives a correspondeDce between a manifold x of three dimensions aild one y of four To a line in the x space corresponds a point in the y space and to a point in the x space corresponds a P2 of a particular type in the y space Corresponding to the projective group we have a 15 parameter group in four dimenisions The first preserves intersecting lines and hence there exists aln invariant relation among two specially selected y points If two lines y and y intersect then Y1 Y1  84  Y4   Y2 Y2  Y3 Y3  0 Hence if we regard y as fixed all the points on a certain hypersurface of the second order must transform into points on a similar hypersurface It is at once seen that the above relation may be made symmetrical by taking instead of the ys themselves certain linear functions of themi lnamely Y  lifY2 Y4 Yl i2 Y2 Y iY4 y3 Y3 iY4 We have now the relation between two points in the Y space X1 Y12  2 Y2  X3 Y2  y Y 2 0 invariant under the transformations of a 15 parameter group The 15 para meter group must therefore transform all points lyinig on a line which meets the sphere at infinity into points on another such line It must therefore leave this sphere invariant It must leave invariant the relation dY2  dY2  d12  dY2  0 See LOVETT Annali di Mathematica ser III3 vol 7 1902 p 391906 J E WRIGHT CORRESPONDENCES AND THEORY OF GROUPS 395 and therefore it must be such that dY2  dY22  dy2  ay42 pYlY2Y3Y4dy2  dY2  dY3  dY2 where Y Y Yj Y is the point obtained from YI Y2 Y3 Y4 by any operation of the group The transformation must therefore be conformal Conversely if any infinitesimal conformal transformation be performed in the Y space it will give a transformation of lines into lines in the x space anld all lines through a given point will transform inlto lines through a point It will therefore be a point transformation which preserves straight lines and will thus be projective Hence we have the theorem The general projective group in three dimensions and the general conformal group in four are simply isonmorphic Further it is easily seen that a hypersurface of the second order contains an infinite number of straight lines of which ocx go through any point on the sur face Conversely this property defines a hypersurface of the second order Now a hypersphere is such a surface and the lines in questionl are all minimal lines Hence a hypersphere must transform into a hypersurface of the second order under the general conformal group But this group leaves the sphere at infinity invariant Hence the transformied sturface must be a hypersphere We see therefore that there must exist sonme complex of lines in three dimensional space which is transformed into a similar complex by all projections This complex is given by Y2  Y2  32   4  2AY  2BY2  2CY3  2DY4 E 0 where A B C D E are constants This becomes YY4  y2y3  ay  bY2  cy3  dy4  e  0 where a b c d e are constants It is in fact a linear complex Hence we see that projection changes a linear complex into a linear complex and further this is the most general point transformation that will do so Incidenltally we note that a correspondence is established between a linear complex and a hyper sphere Now two S3s have one common invariant under all conformal transforma tions namely their angle of intersection Hence there is one invariant under all projections for two linear complexes We shall find it convenient to speak instead of the linear comiplex of the screw for which the lines of the linear com plex are null lines Then a screw corresponds to an S KLEIN Mathematische Annalen vol 5 1872 p 264396 J E WRIGHT CORRESPONDENCES AND THEORY OF GROUPS July Let there be any wrench on a given screw anld consider the moment of the systenm round anv line If S  Y2  Y  1   etc  0 be the 83 corresponding to the giveni line theni the momuent in question is XS where X is defined as the  intensity  of the wrench Now consider any two sciews associate intensity XX   with the first pX   with the second and combine We get a unit wrench on a third screw which lies oln the cylindroid determined by the two original screws We conclude that to a system of screws on a cylindroid corresponds a system of S3s having a common sphere Such a coaxial system includes two points S35s Hence there are two screws of zero pitch on a cylindroid The two points thus determined are inverse points with respect to any onle of the linear system of 83s Now consider any S3 containi ing both these points it corresponds to a screw which has both these lines as null lines and is therefore reciprocal to both the screws of zero pitch hence it is reciprocal to all the screws of the cylindroid But any 83 through two inverse points of S cuts 83 orthogonally Hence if the mutual invariant of two screws vanishes the two corresponding 83s cut at right angles Now consider two P2s in the four dimensional space if every line in one is perpendicular to every line in the other the two P2s are said to be at right angles Take any 83 passing through a fixed 82 in a fixed P2 and let P3 con tain this P2 All 83s with their centres in P3 will have their centres on a fixed line perpendicular to the P2 and passing through the centre of the fixed circle Hence all 83s through the fixed circle will have their centres in a fixed P2 perpendicular to the P2 of the circle and passing through its centre the two P s have of course only one point common There will thus be a locus in 2 the second P2 corresponding to the point spheres of the system Two poinits of this locus lie in any P3 through the given P2 These points lie on the line through the centre of the fixed circle perpendicular to the P2 They are equi distant from the centre and this distance is independent of the particular P3 selected Henice the locus of point spheres of the system is another circle the two circles have the same centre and it is easy to see that the sum of the squares of the radii is zero The relation between the two circles is reciprocal The whole system of S3s is determined by any three independent ones i e ones not having a common 82 If we translate these results into three dimensions we see that given three screws there is a single infinity of lines of the zero pitch belonging to the system thus determined There exists a single infinity of screws of zero pitch reciprocal to the whole systein To the one system corresponds a circle and to the other another circle which is definite when the first is given We thus see that to a regulus corresponds a circle and to the lines meeting the rays of a regulus correspond the points of another circle Similar considerations may1906 J E WRIGHT CORRESPONDENCES AND THEORY OF GROUPS 397 be readily applied to the system arising fromn the four or five screws Four 83S have two points common and the reciprocal system thus includes two point 83s this systenm is in fact coaxial The five system consists of 83 s orthogonal to a given S3 Now suppose we fix a given screw by an inversion we may make the corresponding 83 a P and then a corresponldence is established between the lines of a given complex and points of a P3 for any poilnt in the P3 corresponds to a screw of zero pitch reciprocal to the given screw that is to say any point in the P3 corresponds to a line of the complex determined by the fixed screw Any 83 meets the P3 in a sphere and for a given sphere there is a single infinity of 83s This single infinity is determined bv any given 3 and the P3 It follows that we may regard a sphere as corresponding to all the screws of a cylindroid whieh contains the P Now a cylindroid is deter mined uniquely by two of its screws hence the P3 and any line determine a unique sphere But corresponding to any sphere there are two poilnt 83 S that is to say two lines and hence the correspondence between lines and spheres is a 21 correspondence The points are images in the P3 and therefore the lines are conjugates with respect to the given complex Now consider any two spheres They are the intersections of the P3 with two point 8Sgs the two spheres inter sect in a circle and therefore the two point 83 s lie on a circle which is perfectly determined if the first circle is given The rays of a regulus correspond to the circle thus determined The reguluis is not general for it is self conjugate with respect to the fundamental screw and the directors are therefore niill lines of this screw Suppose that the two spheres touch both circles now become point circles and hence each of them is a pair of mininmal lines Helnce if two spheres touch the four corresponding four dimensional poinits lie on two minimal lines As the spheres are supposed general no two poinits corresponding to the same sphere lie on the same minimal line and therefore the points lie by pairs on two mini mal lines Hence the corresponding lines in the three dimensional space inter sect in pairs We note that this also includes the theorem that if two straight lines intersect their conjugates intersect This correspondence between lines and spheres is of course that of LIE Without inversion we should have a correspondence between lines in ordinary space and spheres in elliptic space We may take six 83S as co6rdinates and thus express any point by means of its powers from these 83S The co6rdinates thus used are the equivalent in four dimensions of DARBOUXS  pentaspherical coordinates in three As a par ticular simplification we take the 83S to be mutually orthogonal and we thus see that the method of discussing screws by referring them to six corecip rocal coordinate screws is strictly in correspondence with DARBOUXS sphere gTeometrv  See DARBOUX Theorie des surfaces vol 1 p 213398 J E WRIGHT CORRESPONDENCES AND THEORY OF GROUPS July We take the powers mentioned to be z1  3  5 6 and then any 83 is given by a linear relation amiong the zs The condition for orthogonality of two S3s a I1ZI  X2z2  X3Z3  X4z4  X5z6  X6 6   and 1 1  X2 2

Z Er Zr  0 rl orthogonally x1 x   x2 xL2  x3 X3  X4 x4  x5 3x  X6 X  0 Hence the point XI X2  X6 lies on S3 and this point is therefore the centre of the point S3 Hence among the six co6rdinates of any point there exists the relation 6 s2 o O t rl 3 Consider the general relation Y2  Y2  YI  Y2  2X1Y1  2X2Y2  22XIY3  2X4Yt  X5  O in conjunctionl with the conformal group in the space Y This equation is invariantive and hence it establishes a correspondence between space of four and that of five dimensions The group for the Xs changes P4s of a particu lar type into P4s of the same type Also the Y group transforms point 3s into poilnt 8 s  and therefore the X group must leave invariant the manifold Xl t X2 f 3 Jr 4 X5 Coaxial S35s in the Y space correspond to lirnes in the X space and thus lines are transformed into lines in the X space The X group is thus seen to be projective and to keep a particular quadric invariant Hence the projective group in five dimensions which preserves a particular quadric is isomorphic to the general projective group in three dimensions and to the t In connection with this S3 geometry see DARBOUX loc cit1906 J E WRIGHT CORRESPONDENCES AND THEORY OF GROUPS 399 general conformal group in four To a general line correspolnds a coaxial system of S3s or since the system is deterinined by its common sphere the cor respondence is one between lines in five and spheres in four dimensions To a system of lines having a common point corresponds a system of spheres lying on a common S3 To the points of a general P2 correspond 83s passing through a given circle anid hence we may say that to a given P2 in five dimensions corre sponds a circle in four If two points are conjuigate with respect to the quadric the corresponding 83s cut orthogonally Hence to the points of a P4 corre spond all the 83s cutting a given 83 orthogonally To the points of a P3 cor respond the 83s orthogonal to two given 83s or passing through two given points and so on Comparing the five dimensionality with the three dimen sionality with which we started we see that e g to straight lines correspond points on the fundamiental quadric and inversion with respect to a linear com plex is equivalent to reflection of the quadric in a given point It is convenient to project the fundamental quadric into an S4 This may be done by taking new coordinates  2 03 t 5 56 where PX1  8 P 2 2 PX3 p344 p 4X5 1 p to 1 The quadric now becomes 6 E 2 J r and the 83 in the four dimensional space becomes 6 1Z1  2252  03 3  04Z4  5 51 where the zs are a mnutually orthogonal set of Ss The plane representation for the three system of screws due to Sir ROBERT BALL  is seen to be a particular case of this correspondence and we note that the projective group in space which projects a three system into itself is simply isomorphic with the plane projective group that preserves a given circle We can at once give a geometrical interpretation in five dimensions to any screw system To a 2system corresponds the system of points on a line and in general to an n system corresponds the points of a P n The most general projection of an n system into itself corresponds to the most general projection of a P n  into itself which preserves a given S2 For example the most general projection of a cylindroid into itself corresponds to the homographic transformiation of a straight line which preserves two givell points and so on We note that corresponding to a P n  0  44 in the five dimension ality there is a reciprocal 4n with respect to the fundamental quadric Hence an n system of screws has a 6  n system of reciprocal screws  Thleory of Screws 1900 chap 15400 J E WRIGHT CORRESPONDENCES AND THEORY OF GROUPS July Now consider n screws and let there be associated with them intensities X1I  X The resultant wrench will be of intensity X   X and if rl   r5 are the co6rdinates of the point corresponding to the rth screw the point corresponding to the resultant screw has the co6rdinates n  n tX8  S ti  5 Hence finding the resultant wrelnch is equiivalent to findilng the mass centre of poinits t with associated multiples X The conditions for possibility of eqluilib rium of wrenches on n given screws follow at once from the five dimensional representation In fact the corresponding points must obviously lie in a Pn1 Hence the n screws must belong to an n  1 system BRYN MAWR January 1906

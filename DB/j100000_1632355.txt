labors with the time honored problem of vertebrate descent must consider sooner or later the arthrodiran  fishes for these with forms similar but even more puzzling were the most conspicuous and diversified of earliest chordates They are first known in the upper Silurian run their gamut of evolutional prosperity in the middle Devonian and become extinct in the early Carboniferous the earlier forms were small with tuberclelike teeth the later often of considerable size with many types of denti tion tubercular trenchant or crushing Un happily however the various forms of arthrodires are known only imperfectly and the fact that various writers have considered them as related to almost every and widely separated groups of living fishes is enough to indicate how little is known of their anatomy Among the latest contributions to this un satisfactory theme are three papers by Dr C R Eastman and these contain such reaction ary views as to the kinship of arthrodires that they merit a somewhat extended review For in the matter of vertebrate descent there should I think be entered a friendly protest against Eastmans conclusionsall the more necessary on account of his deservedly high authority in matters of palvaichthyologyand the reasons should be summarized for regard ing his arguments inadequate On the other hand I do not believe that this is the place to support in detail a rival theoryit is rather to show the intricacy of the materials in volved and the limitations to which our con clusions must be subject Eastman brings out in his papers three essential theses He aims to demonstrate 1 That arthrodires are specialized lungfishes principally on the evidence of dental plates and 1  Dipnoan Affinities of Arthrodires Am Jour Sci Vol XXI February 1906  Structure and

the headroof 2 That the living types of lungfishes par ticularly the Australian Neoceratodus show the closest affinities with Devonian arthro dires especially with Mylostoma the form which has pavementlike dental plates 3 And that he has discovered the way in which the dental plates of Mylostoma were originally arranged These theses may now be ex amined but for convenience they will be taken up in an inverted order I As to the dental apparatus of Mylostoma In various forms of arthrodires there were present at least three pairs of dental platesthere was possibly a greater number of these plates in pairs or azygous but the proof is still imperfect In the case of Mylostoirua the three pairs of plates occur in a single wellpreserved specimen which was first described by the reviewer Mem N 17 Acad Sci 1901 who endeavored to show that these plates corresponded to the  pre maxillary  maxillary  and  mandibular  plates of other arthrodires and that they were arranged in the mouth in a similar mannerthe smallest plate sharply triangu lar becoming the premaxillary and the medium sized ovoidal one the maxillary In the fossil moreover the normal position of the plates in the mouth indicated since two of the plates maxillary and premaxillary are preserved side by side in singularly perfect contact These conditions then become the point of departure for East mans detailed studies which involve by the way over twoscore octave pages Thus ta king a large series of detached dental plates which we infer may well have belonged to different individuals species and probably even genera Eastman places them together secun dum artem until their grinding surfaces fit and thus obtains their  true arrangement By this mode of procedure he first of all changes the relative position of the maxillaries as given by Dean and figures a pair of new ele ments vomerines lying crosswise in the front of the mouth This arrangement how ever does not give permanent satisfaction to its author for in his third paper the vomerine plates are withdrawn from the complex and in this process each of these elements is rotated 900 changed sides transferred from the upper to the lower jaw and described as having be longed to a new mylostomid This change however does not deter the author from still insisting upon the actuality of vomerine plates On the evidence of a new arthrodire Dino mrytostoma in which he describes three pairs of dental plates he argues again from their needs in fitting together that there must have been still another i e a fourth pair of plates Indeed he declares confidently that  unac quainted though we be with actual specimens the existence of vomerine teeth in Mylos toma real or potential is an assured fact That this may be so one will readily admit but it is not quite obvious from Eastmans argument especially when it entails the corol lary that the two wellknown pairs of upper dental plates of Mylostoma are the homologue of the single pair of shear teeth of a closely similar arthrodire Dinichthys For we can not understand why we should be asked to be lieve that two arthrodires similar to each other in a host of characters should be so distinct in this important particular Nor does it make the argument quite convincing when Eastman points out that the  palatine  plate in the young lungfish Neoceratodus passes through a stage in which it shows traces of subdivision  a  Mylostoma stage for this implies a finished perfection of the embryological record which would hardly have been assumed by even Haeckel in his palmiest days In short I can not feel that the work of Eastman on mylostomid dental plates is con vincing He has not demonstrated that the plates in Mylostoma were more numerous than those well known in other arthrodires nor has he modified satisfactorily our views as to their relative arrangement The evidence of the first specimen which shows two of the dental plates in closely fitted contact is still I believe better evidence in the matter of mylostomid dentition than that obtained by elaborate fittings of detached and pos sibly bear witness Eastmans vomerines 48 SCIENCE N S VOL XXVI No 654 unrelated dental plates The chances are in finitely small that in the fossil in question two such plates if once separated could have accidentally 6onme to lie in such accurate ap position And until more perfect material is forthcoming the present specimen remains of paramount value none the less so since as the writer pointed out the faceted surface of these combined plates corresponds to the in dented area of the mandibular which is present in the same fossil and must have apposed them By this view also the denti tion of one arthrodire can best be explained in terms of another the smaller more irregu lar premaxillary of Mylostoma becoming the homologue of the smaller and more irregu lar premaxillary of Dinichthys and the longer oblong  maxillary  to the long  shear tooth  of the latter form It is not necessary therefore to go afield and postulate a closer affinity of the Devonian arthrodire Mylostoma to a recent lungfish when a comparison can readily be made with a contemporary form Dinichthys to which in many regards it is closely akin II As to the very primitive characters of Ceratodus which ally it to Mylostoma and separate it widely from known Paleozoic Lungfishes Eastman expresses his view as to the rela tionship of lungfishes and arthrodires thus A primitive ceratodont from which descend directly Ceratodus and Neoceratodus was the progenitor of two side lines of fishes one giv ing rise to more and more specialized lung fishes the other to more and more specialized arthrodires Before the specialized line of lungfishes became extinct it gave rise suc cessively to such forms as Dipterus Scau menacia Phaneropleuron Uronemus and Ctenodus before the arthrodire line died out it passed through phases represented in the order Macropetalichthys Homosteus 1lIylo stoma Dinomylostoma Coccosteus Dinich thys Titanichthys The fact that in all of the mass of Paleozoic lungfishes there is not a suggestion of the hypothetical Ceratodus is easily waived aside as due to the imperfection of the geological record And thus are re jected Dollos illuminating researches as to the descent of the dipnoans We may query accordingly the reasons why the modern Ceratodus Neoceratodus is assumed to be the primitive dipnoanto say nothing for the present of its kinship to the arthrodira And here Eastmans studies do not appear adequate Ceratodus he points out has a cutting type of dental plates it has a diphycercal tail rather than heterocercal and it has fewer dermal headplates He does not suggest however that we have at the present time a fairly rich material of fossil dipnoans and he fails to indicate that in the ceratodonts many characters common to the early forms do not appear in a word East man does not explain clearly his paradox that we are to believe that these earliest dipnoan characters should be regarded as more modified than the structures of the modern Neoceratodus Indeed the skeptical reader remembers on the contrary that in the earlier fishes the teeth are in the form of tubercles more or less shagreenlike in form and arrangement that in all the earliest groups of true fishes sharks dipnoans cros sopterygians actinopterygians there occur no shearlike dental plates that in the series of definitely known lungfishes beginning with those in the Devonian the tubercular teeth are reduced gradually and that only with the de velopment of their basal supports do there come to be formed cutting dental plates Moreover that this mode of evolution is the true one is confirmed with singular clearness in the gen eral plan of the development of the teeth of Neoceratodus itselfa great number of tuber cular denticles preceding the solidification of their basal supports and the growth of bony cutting ridges In short there is every reason to conclude that the dental plates of Cera todus are derived from dental plates of dipnoans of the paleozoic type and there is no tangible evidence that the dental plates of the recent dipnoan picture the ancestral con dition Again who can doubt that the descent lines of the dipnoans and the ganoids converge very closely in the earlier paleozoic times OneJULY 12 1907 SCIENCE 49 may even be doubtful whether certain of these genera were ganoids rather than lungfishes and close examination of the known struc tures of these forms has led every observer as far as I am aware to postulate the closest kinship between the two groups From these early types upward one may trace in the fossil lungfishes the dermal plates of the headroof becoming less numerous lighter in texture and deeper in position losing com pletely their primitive tuberclestudded sur face From Ceratodus as Tellers figures in dicate to Neoceratodus there is a marked step in this direction and from such a condi tion only can one understand the curiously reduced dermal headroof of Protopterus and Lepidosiren Why accordingly should we believe in the face of this kind of evidence that the condition of the headroof of Cera todus is more primitive than that of the early ganoids and dipnoans conjoined There is certainly adduced no concrete evidence for such a reactionary view Eastmans final evidence as to the ancestral nature of Neoceratodus as far as I am able to find is in the shape of its caudal fin it is diphycercal rather than heterocercal Dollo has shown on the other hand that the earliest dipnoans ganoids and sharks as well are heterocercal and that it was only through the paleonto logical series which he carefully depicts that diphycercy was attained in the modern lungfishes as an eellike adaptation to living in a muddy bottoman evolution in the process of which the dorsal and anal fins became merged with the caudal This cony elusion of Dollo is based upon such strong testimony that it can hardly be disproved merely by the assumption that a prior a diphycercal caudal fin is more primitive than a heterocercal one In short we can find in Eastmans studies no ground for making the stock of Neoceratodus an ancestral one there is indeed no reason evident why it should not have descended from an ancestor resembling Uronemnus or Phaneropleuron III Mylostoma as a Primitive Arthrodire re lated to a Ceratodont Lungfish Mylostoma differed little from its contem porary arthrodires In its gnathal plates however it had evolved restricted crushing surfaces instead of the long tuberclestudded jawrims of Diplognothus Trachosteus Selen osteus or Coccosteus Dinichthys indeed shows transitional characters for the tubercles of the aifterior reaches of the jaws are ground away when the jaws attain a shearlike ac tion and the gnathals of Dirnomylostoma show a still nearer approach to the pavement like surfaces of Mylostoma It short there is evidence that the arthrodira during their extraordinary evolution gave rise to a series of forms whose dental characters ranged from tuberculate to pavementlikea line of evolu tion which it will be recalled is paralleled in other groups of fishessharks ganoids teleosts and as above noted dipnoi Now since the time of the classical studies of 0 Hertwig 1876 on the origin of the bony plates of fishes there has been found no good reason to doubt that the tuberculate condition was the ancestral one and it follows there fore that until strong reasons to the contrary be adduced we can safely assume that the same law of development holds true in the case of the arthrodira That is to say that the crushing plates of Mylostoma are second ary not primitive Eastman however con tends that since Mylostoma resembles Cera todus it is therefore primitive But if as we have indicated above there is little reason to regard Ceratodus as primitive it is clear that the affinities of Mylostoma must be determined by comparison with kindred arthrodira It might be pointed out finally that the great majority possibly eight out of ten of the genera of which jaw plates are known bear tuberculated dental plates including the earliest known arthrodires And this is naturally inter preted in favor of the modified nature of Mylostoma for thus historical evidence sup ports the findings of comparative anatomy If now the foregoing objections to East mans conclusions are valid it is quite clear that the general question of the affinities of the arthrodira is just as doubtful as ever Eastman emphasizing the dipnoan characters50 SCIENCE N S VOL XXVI No 654 of the arthrodira points out similarities in dental plates but these might ally them as well to chimaeroids as to dipnoiin the shape of the caudal fin and its supports which are scarcely more dipnoan than sharklike pleura canth or ganoideanin persistent notochord which might be as well sharklike dipnoan or chimteroidin punctation of dental plates which is a character by no means exclusively dipnoan So that one may I feel hardly con clude with Eastman that the lungfish Neo ceratodus recalls  in its entire organization save for the absence of dermal trunkarmor ing the principal features of the arthrodires or that there are present between the modern lungfish and the ancient arthrodire such intimate structural resemblances that they can not be explained by parallelism but point plainly to common descent Eastman is will ing to admit on the other hand that the evidence is questionable that arthrodires had a vestige of ventral limbs and that they are unlike dipnoans in possessing a shoulder and ventralarmoring But even if we can picture such a paleozoic descendant of primitive lung fishes can we still imagine one which lacks also pectoral limbs and opercular bones and which possessed on the other hand shoulder joints rendering possible a curious dorso ventral movement of the head Certain it is that the resurrected doctrine of the kinship of arthrodira and lungfishes finds little support in the recent studies of Hussakof and others which have shown that the gap between the arthrodira and the pterichthyids is by no means as wide as we have hitherto taught BASHFORD DEAN COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 2Eastman can answer these objections only by minimizing their value as when he maintains that the operculum is represented in the rudimentary spine of Dinichthys and that the movable attach ment of the rib to the cranium in Neoceratodus is comparable to the intermovement of head and trunk in the arthrodira In his comparison of the gnathals of arthrodira with the splenial of dipnoans he calls attention to a fleck of cartilage fossilized on the outer ectal face of a gnathal of Dinomylostoma as evidence of its attachment to a meckelian cartilage but this evidence even if accepted would be as readily ganoidean as dipnoan It may be remarked however that the structure in question is too obscure to warrant a definite judgment as to its nature and the fact that the ectal surface of such a plate is sometimes known to bear tubercles quite like those of the usual head plates does not make the assumption probable that the gnathal plates were placed far from the surface of the head

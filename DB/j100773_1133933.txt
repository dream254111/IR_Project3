j100773,Journal of the American Institute of Criminal Law and Criminology,1133933,A Digest of Laws Establishing Reformatories for Women in the United States,i247513,A DIGEST OF LAWS ESTABLISHING REFORMA TORIES FOR WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES HELEN WORTHINGTON ROGERS If a homogeneous group of legislative enactments considered together with their chronological and geographical distribution may be interpreted as a barometer of social pressure there will be during the next decade a widespread and accelerated demand for the estab lishment of womens reformatories in the United States But with action comes the danger of impulsive legislation of the modifying of local laws originated for other purposes of the perfunc tory copying of the statutes of other statesany one of which may fail to satisfy local needsbut above all there is the danger of over looking those fundamental principles which should be incorporated into every womens reformatory bill Each successive act should be a contribution to the movement as a whole not only by including the best provisions of preceding legislation but by engrafting those new features advocated by the specialist and ultimately demanded by ad vancing public opinion In its issue for November 1917 this JOURNAL published a digest of the laws which had established reformatories for women in the United States up to January of that year Since that time the reprinted enacted and the movement has passed the half century mark This would seem therefore an opportune time for presenting a revision of the digest A halfcentury is a good milestone at which to halt for inventory of achievement and an analysis of new tenden cies The reformatory movement is indicative of the impulse to deal more intelligently more scientifically and more humanely with the delinquent woman and as such will go forward Thirtynine states are still without adequate facilities ultimately the sense of community justice will bring these also into action The purpose of this reprint accordingly is to serve a movement still young in spite of its fiftythree years by presenting a brief chrono logical survey of the legislation as a whole a classification by topics of the provisions of the individual laws and a short summary of recent tendencies in relation to the ideal legislation 1A tabulation of these laws follows this introductionA DIGEST OF LAWS 383 Until 1869 statutory provisions for the institutional care of women convicted of violations of the law were limited to the state prisons in cases of felony and to the jails and houses of correction in cases of misdemeanors In that year Indiana established a separate prison man aged and officered by women to which all women prisoners confined in the state prison were transferred 1873 Although this institu tion was a reformatoryprison rather than a reformatory in the more recent understanding of the word the principle that the problem of the delinquent women is to be differentiated from that of the delinquent man had for the first time been incorporated into the written law of the nation Massachusetts followed in 1874 New York in 1881 1890 and 1892 after which there was no further legislation of this type until 1900the beginning of a new century These thirtyone years between 1869 and 1900 might aptly be designated as a pioneer periodone during which only three states took action and only four institutions were created During this same period however certain other legislation affecting the movement was taking place In 1877 New York passed the progressive law which created the Elmira Re formatory With this there began a series of similar enactments establishing not only correctional institutions for young men in other states but industrial schools for boys and later industrial schools for girls until by 1915 all but twelve states had provided by statute for the custodial care and education of delinquent girls This movement doubtless ultimately accelerated the demand for an institution for women intermediate between these industrial schools on the one hand and the state prisons and jails on the other but in the beginning prob ably retarded it Certainly it had little or no effect on legislation dur ing the first decade of the new century for Iowa in 1900 was the only state to establish a reformatory between 1900 and 1910 With 1910 the second decade of the twentieth century there began what might be called the period of acceleration Thirteen states joined the movement between 1910 and 1920New Jersey in 1910 Ohio in 1911 Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in 1913 Maine and Min nesota in 1915 Connecticut Kansas and Michigan in 1917 and Arkan sas California Nebraska and Washington in 1919 Vermont in 1921 and Rhode Island in 1922 are the only two states taking action since the beginning of the third decade Comparing the number of reforma tories established during the last thirty years of the last century with the first twentytwo of thisthree against sixteenthe movement shows acceleration but a retarded acceleration For contrary to first expectations the local state and federal activities during the war had A DIGEST OF LAWS 383384 HELEN WORTHINGTON ROGERS no great influence on the establishment of institutions of the reforma tory type Of the 3seven measures proposed for the control of venereal disease by the Senate Committee on Military Affairs all but one were concerned with the medical aspects of the problem and that one assisting states in building reformatories    for hygienic social and economic redemption and restoration of venereal disease carriers was ultimately abandoned and activities concentrated on the control of conditions surrounding the training camps detention hos pitals and research work in chosen laboratories It is true that be tween 1917 and 1921 practically all the states either enacted new laws or passed more stringent regulations relating to the prostitute class but these provisions stressed the detection treatment and quar antine of disease and well with few exceptions noninstitutional in character In other words the war legislation in so far as it affected delinquent women emphasized the old conception of the selfpreserva vation of society albeit in modern terms Reformatory legislation of the newer type on the other hand recognizes the necessity of medi cal treatment and custodial care until cure but emphasizes it merely as a means to the moral and industrial construction of the individual woman THE DATA Statutory provisions for the institutional care of delinquent women outside of jails and penitentiaries show comfortable variation Prac tically all of the states permit commitment to private institutions a few contract with other states a number extend the age limits of the girls indusrial schools and a more recent group establish institutions for a special class A clear cut definition therefore becomes even more imperative than it was in 1917 A reformatory for women for the purpose of the present study is an institution established maintained and controlled by the state to which delinquent women over the age of commitment to the industrial schools for girls may be sentenced by the courts having jurisdiction over their offenses for the purposes of care treatment training and reformation According to this definition the Nebraska statutes establishing the Industrial Home for Women an institution to which the inmates commit themselves is eliminated because of the voluntary clause The group of statesIdaho Michi gan Nevada New Mexico Wyoming and the District of Columbia 3P 8 Manual for the Various Agents of the United States Interdepart mental Social Hygiene Board  P 19 ibid 384 2EZ wrJI HELEN WORTHINGTON ROGERSA DIGEST OF LAWS 385 providing for its delinquent women by proxy has been omitted as not within the boundaries of the definition Alabama 925 Maryland 1621 North Carolina 21 regon 1225 and South Carolina 1820 permit the sentencing of women to their state training schools for girls beyond the usual age of commitment i e 1618 Three principles of separation should distinguish the womens reformatory not only the separation of men from women and women from girls but its separation from custodial institutions established primarily for quarantine and medical care For obvious reasons this group was omitted So too the statutes establishing the State Detention Home for Women in Colorado and the State Sanitorium for Women in Illinois on the ground that they were hospitals and not reformatories The states whose statutes were finally selected as coming within the scope of this study are as follows 2Arkansas 2California 2Connecti cut Indiana Iowa 2Kansas Maine Massachusetts 2Michigan Min nesota Nebraska New Jersey New York Ohio Pennsylvania 2Rhode Island 2Vermont 2Washington and Wisconsin The data presented in the following pages are compiled from the statutes of the nineteen states having established reformatories for women according to the definition already stated The various pro visions of those laws are arranged under six main heads I Estab lishment II Administrative Powers III Commitments IV De scription of Institution V Conduct of Institution and VI Special Provisions Under each subhead an effort has been made to sum marize the provisions on that particular topic I ESTABLISHMENT A Name of State The names of the states now numbering nineteen have already been given B Dates 1 The dates on which the institutions were legally established and 2 The dates on which they were opened for the admission of inmates together with their official titles and locations are given in the following table 1869Indiana Womans Prison Indianapolis  1873 2Added since January 1917 A DIGEST OF LAWS 385386 HELEN

State Reformatory for Women Cranston Not yet opened C Citations The citations given under this heading include 1 The law establishing the institution 2 The laws amending 1 and 3 Laws affecting and specifying the institution by name Laws affecting but not specifying it have been indicated in the tabulated digest by  It is interesting to note that at least thirteen states since 1917 have either amended the original law or passed other laws D Original Appropriations Considerable range is shown in the initial appropriations When old buildings have been used the amounts are comparatively small ranging from 2000 to 20000 when created de novo from 20000 for purchase of land to 425000 covering four years construction E N anale of Institutiont The official names of the twenty reformatories 19 states bear testimony to the trend away from a stigmabearing title Iowa and Massachusetts have already made such changes since their establishment As the titles now stand nine use the word reformatory eleven other 386 HELEN WORTHINGTON ROGERSA DIGEST OF LAWS 387 terms Of these eleven only two have clung to prison one to house of refuge and one to house of correction Seven states have eliminated entirely the words prison correction refuge and reformatory Of these four prefer farmtwo with no qualifying adjective and two industrial farm Four use the adjec tive industrialtwo industrial farm and two industrial home Three use the title industrial home one adding and clinic One uses the term training school Of the nine new states establishing reformatories since 1917 only two use reformatory Vermont re verts to the old terms of prison and house of correction but all of the others prefer less stigmabearing names II ADMINISTRATIVE POWERS The statutory provisions relating to the administrative powers have been classified under three headsA Chief Administrative Power B Superintendent and C Subordinate Officers and Employees A Chief Administrative Pozer Legislation affecting the chief executive powers has since 1917 undergone more changes than any other one feature The administra tion of the various institutions is vested in authorities of three general typesthe single board created for the management of the single reformatory the centralized authority with statewide power over similar institutions and a combination of the two 1 The special boards which in 1917 numbered six out of ten now number only seven out of nineteenArkansas California Con necticut Indiana Maine New York and Pennsylvaia These boards are charged with construction and general administration The two last named had special provision for the erection of the buildings but as this was merely temporary they are included in this group 2 The centralized administrative power assumes three different forms in which authority is vested in a a group e g a board of control of state institutions b in an individual e g a com missioner of correction and c in a combination of a and b e g a state corrections commission having an executive officer known as a commissioner of correction Ten states fall into this centralized groupIowa Kansas Nebraska Ohio Rhode Island and Wisconsin in the first division Massachusetts Vermont and Washington in the second and Michigan in the third Michigan and Visconsin appear to have the most complicated systems A DIGEST OF LAWS 387388 HELEN  ORTHJNGTON ROGERS 3 To the third typethe combination of centralized with local ized authoritybelong Minnesota having a state board of control and a board of women visitors New Jersey a state board of con trol of state agencies and board of managers and Washington with a director of business control and a special parole board 1 Titlcs Three names are used in connection with the single boardsdirectors managers and trustees The second group show greater varietvfour have boards of control the remainder as many names as states 2 Number The single administrative boards range in number of members from four to nine five seven and nine preferred The centralized boards range from three to nine four and five slightly predominating 3 Appointment and Removzal Appointments are made by the governor with or without the sanction of the senate or council six are made without thirteen require approval Four statutes fail to specify how vacancies shall be filled in seven the governor may fill without approval in eight approval must be secured Four states also fail to specify the terms of removal In seven the governor may remove for cause without sanction in six consent of senate or coun cil is required in one removal may be with or without consent and in one the majority of the other members of the board must acquiesce 4 Qualifications Eight statutes specify no qualifications what ever for appointment Four require nonpartisanship three political limitations one geographical two citizenship and one a professional qualification Three progressive states add to these other qualifica tions that of fitness for the position and Indiana in addition specifies that any financial connection with the institution renders the candidate ineligible 5 Sex Of the twelve states naming the sex of the chief admini strative power eleven require boards made up of both men and women Indiana has the only allwoman board in full charge of the institution Minnesota and Washington have allwomen advisory boards but they are subordinate to the chief authority The propor tion of women to men on the mixed boards is of interest Minnesota and Rhode Island regulate the proportion by lawthe former three men and two women the latter three women and six men The others specify that at least a certain number shall be women but place no maximum New Jersey which has two aministrative powers places one in eight on its board of control but on the board of man agers for the reformatory itself requires women to be in the majority 388 HELEN WORTHINGTON ROGERSA DIGEST OF LAWS 389 Arkansas and California also require a woman majorityfive out of nine and three out of five Other proportions are one out of three two out of five 2states two out of seven three out of seven and three out of nine 6 Terms These range from two to eight years three and six preferred 7 Arangement of Tcrms The principle underlying the various arangements of terms is apparently that of changing as few members as possible at any one time annual and biennial changes being in the majority 8 Organization The majority of the statutes place no restric tion on selforganization Iowa and Minnesota designate as president the member whose term first expires Wisconsin limits the presidents term to two years 9 Compensation Classified according to remuneration received the administrative authorities fall into three groupsthe unsalaried those having nominal compensation and the highly salaried devoting their entire time to the service of the state Of the twentytwo execu tive powers three states having double powers eight fall into the first group four into the second and ten into the third All receive necessary traveling and other expenses The first receive only these the second the amounts respectively of 30 a year and traveling ex penses not to exceed 125 5 and 10 a day when actually in service The salaries of the third group range from 3000 to not more than 10000 a year 10 Powers and Duties Without exception the statutes estab lishing reformatories for women specify in more or less detail the powers and duties of their administrative agents These fall under four headsduties of a preliminary nature powers relating to the preparation of the institution for occupancy powers relating to general management and miscellaneous duties The first includes qualifica tions for office the giving of bond and the taking of the oath the second the acquisition of the sitepermanent or temporaryby gift purchase condemnation or use of state property the preparation of plans the making of contracts the erection and equipment of build ings the third is concerned with the management of the reformatory after its official opening This section includes the legal custody and control of the property and of the inmates the general management of grounds buildings officers and inmates the making of rules and regu lations the appointment of superintendent and subordinates the fixing of compensation unless otherwise specified by law the care support A DIGEST OF LAWS 389390 HELEN WORTHINGTON ROGERS discipline training employment remuneration and recreation of in mates the establishment of facilities for the examination and treat ment of physical and mental disease and of specified industries the disposal of products the transfer of inmates parole and discharge the investigation of the management of the institution and the con luct of the officers The miscellaneous duties relate to reports records and accounts B Sluperintendent 1 Appointment and Removal Fourteen of the statutes provide for the appointment of the superintendent by the chief administrative power without restriction or time limit two specify the latter one for a two and one for a four year period Michigan places the appoint ment in the hands of the governor on recommendation of the chief administrative power In New Jersey this is ihade by the board of managersthe secondary powerwith the approval of the state board in Rhode Island the commission appoints the director of state institu tions on recommendation of its executive officer The method of removalspecified in eleven statesis by the chief administrative power three qualifying that the removal shall be for cause Only one requires the approval of a still higher authority Indiana makes it comlpulsory on the governor to remove the superintendent for graft 2 Sex Fourteen of the statutes specify that the office of super intendent must be filled by a woman one that it may be four fail to designate the sex 3 Qualifications Six of the nineteen states now describe the qualifications to be required of the superintendent two in the general terms of skilled and suitable one that he or she must be a physi cian of specified training and experience Arkansas attempts to safe guard the appointment by stating that she must have had experience by observation and technical training in similar institutions Kansas that she must be an experienced educator and Indiana that she must be skilled by education and practice to have charge of the institution 4 Salary The amount of salary to be paid the superintendent is determined either by the chief administrative power 10 states by law 2 or regulated by other state departments 4 three fail to specify 5 Powers and Duties The preliminary duties assigned the superintendent concern the giving of bond the oath of office and resi HELEN WORTHINGTON ROGERS 390A DIGEST OF LAWS 391 dence at the institution Her powers in relation to the reformatory itself are practically identical with those of the chief administrative power because as its legal agent she becomes responsible for carry ing out these provisions Her miscellaneous obligations concern the keeping of records accounts and making of reports C Subordinate Officers and Employees 1 Appointment and Removal Subordinate officers and em ployees are appointed in one of three waysby the superintendent without approval by the superintendent subject to approval or directly by the chief administrative authority In six states she is allowed a free hand in nine approval must be obtained and in four appointments are made by the higher power The majority also fail to describe the terms of removal Three states give the superintend ent a free hand in removal and one removal subject to the higher authority In Massachusetts the superintendent may remove but the officer may be given a hearing by the commissioner of correction on request in writing In Indiana employees must be removed by the governor for graft 2 Sex Nine states make no provisions under this head three specify that they must be women four women as far as practicable two women if coming in contact with the inmates in one the steward must be a woman 3 Qualifications Only three states describe the qualifications for appointment to subordinate positions Indiana requires that they must be chosen only after examination for fitness regardless of political or religious affiliations Kansas specifies that they shall not be related by blood or marriage to any member of the board In Pennsylvania employees shall be selected only after strict examination as to moral character and fitness to care for and instruct inmates 4 Nuinber and Titles These are determined by the chief execu tive power in eight states by the superintendent in one by the super intendent under direction of the first in two in three they are speci fied by law Seven specify the titles of one or more of the subordi nates five make no provisions under either head 5 Salaries The salaries of this group are fixed by the chief administrative power in seventeen statesthree with and fourteen without reference to other state departments Two statutes do not specify 6 Duties These are prescribed by the chief executive power in seven of the statutes by the superintendent in five by the latter sub A DIGEST OF LAWS 391392 HELEN WORTHINGTON ROGERS ject to the former in one and by the latter after consultation with the superintendent in another five states make no provisions in the stat utes under consideration These duties are given in general terms with few exceptions Indiana has strict provisions to prevent pecuniary profit or political activity III COMMITMENTS A Age Massachusetts alone fixes no age limitneither minimum nor maximum Two specify both a maximum and minimum for all classes and two others for special groups Fourteen states fix no maximum giving a minimum only the lowest twelve years the highest eighteen Six states specify sixteen and five eighteen as the minimum age limit B Courts Having Jurisdiction In general terms courts having jurisdiction over the offense are the courts of jurisdiction C Powers of the Courts of Jurisdiction The statutory powers granted to these courts are of three kinds 1 permissive powers under which it is optional with the judge whether women convicted of violations of the law shall be sentenced to the reformatory or to other correctional institution 2 obliga tory powers under which convicted women must be sent to the reformatory and 3 permissive and obligatory powers which give the court permissive powers in cases of certain offenses and in others allow it to act only within definite limits Nine states belong to the first group two to the second and six to the third Two fail to specify in the laws included in the digest D Classes to be Comnmitted The classes of delinquent women to be committed to the various reformatories are described in three waysby their crimes or mis demeanors by the duration of the sentences previously provided by law for the offense or by the correctional institutions to which they had previously been sentenced Because of this lack of uniformity in description delinquent women for the purposes of this study are divided into three classes Class A made up of those convicted of 392 HELEN NWORTHINGTON ROGERSA DIGEST OF LAWS 393 felonies or of crimes punishable by imlprisonment in the state prisons Class B made up of those convicted of misdemeanors and punishable by imprisonment in jails or other correctional institutions and Class C made up of special groups of offenders not included in either Classes A or B All of the statutes undier consideration provide for the commit ment of Class A and Class B except Nebraska which admits Class B only Four however make certain limitations as to Class A California admits members of this group when transferred from the state prison under specified conditions New York those between sixteen and thirty if never previously committed of crime punishable in a state prison except murder in first or second degree Washing ton except those convicted of murder in the first and second degree arson in the first and robbery and Wisconsin first offenders unless guilty of murder in the first second or third degree All of the laws provide for the admission of Class B including those convicted of prostitution variously described habitual intoxication drug using giving or selling vagrancy due to prostitution or drunkenness and petty larceny Three states make certain exceptionsOhio of those sentenced for less than thirty days New Jersey of those over twenty five and Wisconsin those given sentences for less than one year In addition to offenders naturally classified under A or B special groups are admitted to several of the reformatories California accepts women requesting admission and believed by the board to be in danger of becoming prostitutes drunkards or criminalsthe only provision of its kind among the statutes under consideration The courts of Connecticut may commit unmarried girls between sixteen and twentyone leading vicious lives or in danger of falling into habits of vice those of Washington girls between sixteen and eighteen delinquent or dependentthe only dependent group admitted under any statute Massachusetts and New York under recent legislation have established special divisions to which mentally defective delin quent women may be transferred or committed under carefully speci fied conditions E Sentences Two types of sentences appear in the laws establishing the reforim atories for women in the United Statesthe determinate and the indeterminate Although the statutes of eighteen states now use the term indeterminate in relation to the sentence of imprisonment to be imposed by the committing court none of them except Nebraska A DIGEST OF LAWS 393394 HELEN WORTHINGTON ROGERS has yet vested the judge with the power to give a true indeterminate sentenceone without either minimum or maximum stated The law establishing Nebraskas reformatory definitely specifies that the courts shall not make commitment for a definite termthat no minimum or maximum is to be specified But as a matter of fact other laws previously established render this inoperative as worded lWhat actually is imposed is a term indeterminate within limits either within a maximum or within both a minimum and a maximum Ten states now use only the socalled indeterminate sentence eight also use the determinate sentence making nine still clinging to the determinate fetich The determinate sentence when given is in connection with the more serious offenders and for longer terms except in Indiana where the reverse is true The indeterminate sentence takes on a number of forms In four statesCalifornia Indiana Nebraska and Vermont only one general grade is used i e between the minimum and maxi mum fixed by law for the offense except California which specifies a six months minimum and a five years maximum  Vermont excepts life prisoners Eleven states provide for two grades One of these two generally involves a longer sentence and is sometimes applied only to Class A offenders Eight place the term at the maximum prescribed by previous law for the offense if this exceeds three years one 5 years  two place it between the minimum and maximum and one within the latter The other grade is described as a sentence within a maximum minimum not stated Ten states place this at three years and two at five Kansas has a slight variation to this her first is an indeterminate sentence between a minimum and maximum but her sec ond is within the minimum for first offenders under twentyfive New York has an indeterminate sentence within three years for both classes but this is extendable for the special group of the defective delin quents One stateMassachusettshas four grades within five two and one year respectively according to the offenses also the new indefinite term for the defective Washington also has a provision resembling those of Massachusetts and New York in that it permits a detention beyond three years for women passed upon by a board of experts as in need of longer care F Records Two kinds of records are specified by the statutes 1 Court records to be sent to the institution at the time of commitment and 394 HELEN WORTHINGTON ROGERSA DIGEST OF LAWS 395 2 Institutional records All but four require those of the first group of these five are specific as to the data to be forwarded by the courtsKansas Massachusetts Maine Nebraska and Wisconsin Only twelve states describe the kind of record to be kept at the institu tion of these six are detailedCalifornia Kansas Massachusetts Ohio Pennsylvania and Wisconsin G Notification of Commitment Eight of the statutes provide that the courts shall notify the superintendent of commitment eleven fail to specify H Attendants 1 Sex Of the thirteen states in which the sex of the attendants is specified seven require that they shall be women two require women under special conditions one a woman when feasible one that it shall be suitable and one designates the sheriff 2 Prozided by These attendants are provided either by the county in which the woman is sentenced 6 states or by the institu tion 4 One leaves it optional with the court as to whether the attendant shall be provided by the court or sent from the inctitution The others fail to specify Provisions for Children of Women Committed Provisions for children of inmates either inside or outside the reformatory are provided by statute 1 Inside the Reformatory Nine of the nineteen statutes pre vent the separation of mother and child by admitting the latter under certain specified ages three specify that they must be nursing chil dren three that they must be under one year of age another under eighteen months and two that they must be under two 2 Outside the Reformatory Fourteen states make no provision for children over these ages at the time of the commitment of the mother five make it obligatory on the courts to provide for those without proper guardianship IV DESCRIPTION OF INSTITUTION A Purpose The purpose of the several institutions is defined more or less briefly in all of the laws except five Custody preservation of health A DIGEST OF LAWS 395396 HELEN WORTHINGTON ROGERS reformation of character and education for selfsupport are given as the goals of the reformatory treatment B Acreage 1 Specified by Law The acreage to be purchased for the in stitution is described in eleven of the statutes Seven place a mini mum on the amount to be purchased two a maximum and two both a minimum and a maximum These amounts range from a minimum of three acres in Indiana to a maximum of five hundred in Penn sylvania 2 Actual The acreage purchased by the several states is as follows Arkansas 186 California 680 Connecticut 850 Indiana 1561 Iowa 2192  Kansas 165 Maine 200 Massachusetts 233 Michigan  Minnesota 167 Nebraska 120 New Jersey 370 New York Albion 97 Bedford 195 Ohia 259 Pennsylvania 500 Rhode Island  Vermont 25 Washington   Wisconsin 244 2 C Description of Land Of the twelve statutes placing limitations on the kind of land to be purchased two designate the actual property to be used one that it shall be in the center of the state three give only the gen eral provision of suitability the remaining seven describe the various qualifications relating to water and wood supplies nature of soil drain age transportation facilities market valuation healthfulness of loca tion and particularly the possibilities of productivity of food for the inmates and agricultural work and training D Buildings Thirteen of the statutes provide for the character of construction of the buildings seven that they shall be on the cottage plan two designate old buildings already in use by the states two that they shall be arranged for classification one for two separate departments and one that they shall be of brick E Notification of Opening of Institution Of the ten states making provision for this detail seven specify that it shall be done by proclamation of the governor and three by the chief administrative power 396 HELEN WORTHINGTON ROGERSA DIGEST OF LAWS 397 V CONDUCT OF INSTITUTION A Relating to Inmates 1 Preliminarv Examination Only five of the statutes under con sideration include any clause relating to the physical or mental exami nation of the delinquent women when committed to the institution other states e g Massachusetts New Jersey New York and Rhode Island cover this point by other laws or regulations Arkansas Cali fornia Washington and Connecticut provide for mental examinations as well as physical Wisconsin has elaborate provisions for the equip ment of one department for the treatment of venereal disease and another as a psychological laboratory 2 Treatment California and Wisconsin are the only states definitely specifying that medical treatment shall be given Wisconsin provides for the sterilization of delinquent women under careful legal restrictions 3 Classification Eleven states provide in their statutes for the classification of inmates eight fail to specify 4 Transfers Between Reformatories and Other State Institu tios a To the reformatory from other institutions All but three of the statutes provide for this transfer of women from other state institutions b from the reformatory to other state institutions All but five states permit this type of transfer These include the state prisons jails workhouses girls industrial schools insane and other hospitals institutions for feebleminded epileptic and others Such transfers are safeguarded by special provisions Six states have now abolished their departments for women in their state prisons by transfering them to their state reformatoriesIndiana Iowa Kansas Ohio Massachusetts and Vermont 5 Edlucation Sixteen of the nineteen laws provide specifically for the education of the inmates The following forms are men tionedphysical culture general instruction in common school branches vocational training including useful trades and occupations especially domestic science vocational advice moral and religious teach ing and suitable recreation 6 Employment Fourteen of the nineteen statutes contain clauses relating tothe employment of inmates Seven states now have specific provisions for the establishment of productive industries for state use and saleCalifornia Kansas Massachusetts Minnesota New Jer sey Pennsylvania and Washington A DIGEST OF LAWS 397398 HELEN WORTHINGTON ROGERS 7 Remuneration Seven states now provide for the remunera tion of its inmates for labor performedCalifornia Kansas Min nesota Nebraska New Jersey New York and Pennsylvania 8 Release fromi Institution a Parole 1 Paroling Power The power of parole is vested either in a the chief executive power 10 states b in a combi nation of the chief administrative power the superintendent and il one instance other officials c parole boards 5 states four of these general parole boards and one a special board for the reformatory only and d the board of pardons 1 Two stat utes fail to specify 2 Conditions Sixteen of the statutes describe one or more conditions on which parole may be granted These conditions include good physical condition ability to earn an honest living satisfactory institutional record a proper home to which to go employment secured in advance reasonable probability of being lawabiding Kansas is permitted parole to first offenders under twentyfive years of age in less than the minimum terms of their sentence Four states make the recommendation of the superin tendent a requisite Nebraska and Washington specify freedom from venereal disease Minnesota has a special provision for examination and if infection is found require a pledge to report for treatment Parole for life prisoners is restricted to a fifteen years minimum in New Jersey five years in Ohio In Maine women sentenced for more than five years are ineligible for parole Clothing transportation and money to the amount of 5 to 25 may be furnished by the superintendent in a number of states Massachusetts has a recent amendment permitting the parole of a woman about to be confined if for the best interests of mother and child 3 Agents Only seven of the nineteen states provide in this group of statutes for parole agents in these they are fur nished by the chief administrative power 4 Penalty for Violation Eight of the statutes imply that return to the institution for the violation of parole is permissive six that it is obligatory the others fail to specify The additional penalties described are the requirement to serxe the unexpired maximum terms and in one stateMAainenot more than one year dating from the expiration of that maximum sentence 398 HELEN WORTHINGTON ROGERSA DIGEST OF LAWS 399 5 Returned By Thirteen statutes provide for the return of violators of parole either by officers of the institutions or others having the proper authority Michigan New York and Wisconsin specify officers of the institutions The authority for return emanates from the chief administrative power or superin tendent in all instances except in Iowa where the board of parole issues the order 6 Expenses Paid By Only five states specify as to this detail of these four compensate from the funds of the institu tion one from the county from the which the woman was com mitted b Escape 1 Penalty For This is specified in eight of the statutes Return to the reformatory if apprehended is obligatory in all In Nebraska escape is a criminal offense and punishable by one to ten years in the penitentiary In Massachusetts escape or attempted escape is punishable by imprisonment not exceeding five years in Wisconsin not exceeding two years In Maine escaped inmates according to a recent amendment may be arrested and detained after the expiration of the original sentence 2 Returned By Only five statutes make any provision under this head four are the same as for the return of parole offenders in New York marshals without warrant have the authority 3 Paid By The only two specifying as to this detail Indiana and Washingtonstate that compensation shall come from the funds of the

womens reformatory movement in the United States from 1869 to 1922 in terms of actual legislation Just how far they now incor porate the demands of the penologist and of the social reformer it is of value to ascertain Accepting the printed reports of the proceedings of the National Prison Association and of the Conference of Charities and Correction as representing progressive thought on the subject of institutional care of delinquent women we find a steady emphasis and a fairly uni form agreement as to certain desiderata an institution whose spirit A DIGEST OF LAWS 405406 HELEN WORTHINGTON ROGERS and purpose shall be remedial and reconstructive rather than puni tive working for the speedy return of the offender to community life as a healthy lawabiding and selfsupporting member nonpartisan management highgrade officials the commitment of all women now sent to prisons jails and workhouses except those insane feeble minded and epileptic an indeterminate sentence without maximumi or minimum thus permitting the permanent segregation of those incap able of being benefitted by reformatory treatment adequate social records as a basis for reformative training thorough physical examina tion including the Wassermann and other tests for venereal disease mental and psychiatric examination including such group tests as the Army Yerkes and BinetSimon tests freedom of transfers be tween reformatory and other state institutions for the best good of the individual inmate classification of inmates according to types and their needs the cottage plan facilities for open air life educational facilities and industrial training including domestic science a system of employment planned primarily for the teaching of useful trades rather than for securing remuneration for the institution contract labor being prohibited adequate recreational facilities a credit system for inmates and the parole system parole agents to be provided during the period of conditional release A comparison of these demands with the provisions of the stat utes analyzed shows response in varying degrees As few fail to de fine the purpose of the institutions they establish and that purpose when stated is reconstructive in character womens reformatory legis lation may be said to be uniformly based on the principle that the protection of society is best gained through the reformation rather than the punishment of the offender Consistently with this the establishment of an educational system specified in more or less detail is obligatory in practically all of the states Employment is also recognized as a reformatory agency the more recent provisions being especially specific in this particular The need of open air life is acknowledged by the ample acreage now being required More or less freedom of transfer between state institutions for the best good of the individual inmate is now an established routine Parole is also an integral part of the reformatory system and although less than half of the particular statutes under consideration provide for parole agents the majority doubtless supply such supervision in ac cordance with other legislation Six of the twenty desiderata there fore have been incorporated by the statutes of the progressive states so far having established reformatories for women A number of the 406 HELEN WORTHINGTON ROGERRSA DIGEST OF LAWS 407 others have been partially met All of the states have granted the principle of the indeterminate sentence even if they have withheld its actual practice and the classification of inmates is obligatory in over onehalf of them In the remaining particulars the statutes taken as a group lack sufficiently definite provisions to satisfy the exacting penologistprovisions for the obligatory cottage system adequate physical and mental examination and subsequent treatment standard ized records the merit system facilities for recreation remuneration the prohibition of contract labor nonpartisan administration and officials of higher grade but above all for the commitment of all delinquent women of all classes to reformatories for women rather than to jail penitentiaries and prisons and the practice of the genuine indeterminate sentence But there are certain tendencies in recent legislation which point to progress There is an obvious tendency toward state centralization of authority and the placing of this authority in the hands of trained and salaried specialists toward the standardization of fiscal affairs toward safeguarding by statute the appointment to positions of re sponsibility toward specific rather than general provisions In spite of the complicated machinery likely to result the movement is toward a higher grade of executive aind a more efficient and economical ad ministration of state institutions including reformatories for women Tendencies toward treating the offender rather than the offense are evidenced in the growing emphasis on scientific physical and mental examination as a basis for classification greater flexibility n transfers the variation in the classes to be committed to the reformatories for women and in remuneration as an incentive as well as an act of justice to the student of the reformatory movement a gratifying phase of recent legislation the expansion of the period of custodial care for special groups This is the first step toward the realization of the genuine indeterminate sentence A DIGEST OF LAWS 407TABULATION OF LAWS ESTABLISHING REFORMATORIES FOR WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES BY MARLON CANDY DODD AND HELEN

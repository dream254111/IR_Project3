MISSIONARY SOCIETY and LieutCol STEELE FRGS ReadFebruary 9th and June 14th 1852 IN our late journey to the country of Sebitoane or the region situated between 200 and 300 miles beyond Lake Ngam we followed our former route ulltil we came to Nchokotsa From thence with our Bamangwato guides our course became nearly due N crossing the dry bed of the Zouga at a point where a few small stone dykes for catching fish still remain when we entered a country abounding in what are termed  saltpans one of which named Ntwetwe was at Ieast 15 miles broad and perhaps lOQ long another we found covered with an incrustation of salt about two inches thick but ln general they had only a thin efflorescence of salt and lime Large numbers of several varieties of recent shells strewecI tbeir surfaces alld each saltpan had a spring of brackish water on one of its banks Ill speculating on these curious features in the physical appearance of this country we have sometimes thought that the continual deposit for centuries resulting fronl the evaporation of the water of these springs may have been the chief agent in their brmation But the presence of recent shells shouTs that the forulerly more extended M 2164 OSWELL and LIVINGSTON s Encyloratzons flow of the Zouga may have had something to do in the matter Beyond the saltparls the country is perfectly level and harl and coveIed svith lWopane and Baobob trees the underlying rock being white tufi in which a great number of springs of good water are found These from their number anl pre ximity are called  Matlomaganyanan or the  links as of a chain A con siderable population vf Bushmen live in their vicinity under the sway of Sekhami They are remarkably unlike their more southern brethren though speaking a lialect of the same language and bearing the same name They are fine tall strapping fellows and nearly as black as the Caffires and are also the most daling Bushmen in the country frequently killing the elepharlt both by day and during moonlight nights rhe entire Bushman nation as scattered over the Kalahari desert around and west wards of the Lake and likevise in the regions to the N of thatS must be very large The theory that Bushmen are HottentotsS driven to their present position and habits by the encroachlnents of the whites receives no confirmation from any tradition existing among themselves nor from the actual and iminemorial condition of the rnore distant llorles Around the vvells and indeed through the whole region uEton which we had now entered a tree called Mopane abounds The leaf is pecllliar in shape and aff8ords shelter to myriads of a little inRect nof Iarger than the head of a common pin The dwellings of these little colonists are in shape like a limpetshell ancl though each is only large enollgh to hold its little owner so many exist on one leaf that being of a sweet gummy substance the natives collect them in large quantities for food The country between the Matlomaganyana and the Mabab was the worst we had seen in Atica The drought was excessive not a bird or an insect disturbed the stillness of death which reigneel over the scene All around was one level of low scrub Mohonono bush and Mopane trees Our Bushman guide seemed to wander or only follow the tracks of elephants made when going from one Moho nono bush to another which however on the morning of the fourtil day disappeared altogether Having come at length upon a rhinoceros trail we allowed the cattle which were nearly worn Out by the deep dry sands through which we had passed to run along it until their instinct led them to the water unfbrtunately however at a part of the Mababi infested by the  Tsetse fly We were unfeignedly thankful to find ourselves on the banks of this river as it is a branch of the Tso flowing to the EN E BakobaBushmen and Psanajoa villages we found on its banks the inhabitants deriving subsistence from a root called stsitla when their crops fail rlhe Banajoa huts are buit with a kind of second story the upper being the sleeping place A fire is placediWltO Central Africa 1G5 under it in ordel that the occupants may get rid f their trouble some tormentors the mosquitoes by lneans of the smoke Chombo the head man of the Banajoa village became our guide to Sebi toane and led us through the reedy swamp about 10 miles broad on which his village is situated and across the river Sonta by night on account of it being infested by the tsetse and early on the morning of the l9th of June we found ourselves on the banks of the Chobe As circumstances led to our remain ing on this spot in lat 18 20 S and long 26 E for more than two months and the hopes which Mr Oswell anl I tElell entertained are not entirely extinguished I may be excused entering a little into detail Sebitoane the great chief of this large territory was one of a llorle of Mantatees which in 1824 threatened to destroy Lat takoo and invade the colony Driven back by the Griquas he fled towards the nortll and fighting his way through the countries of the Bawanketse Bakwain and Ramangueato he followed nearly the same route as our own to the Zouga Having plun dered the Bakoba and Botletli living on that river he next crossed over the desert between Lake Ngami antl the Damazas to the west Scarcity of water and the bravery of the Damaras obliged him however to retrace his steps much poorer in cattle tilan upon his arrival Proceeding up the Tamunakle he con qllered the black races inhabiting the rivers Chobe Sesheke c and at last established himself on an island said to have been formed artificially by Seunturu a chief of the Borotse IJaving been informed of the efforts made in vain by Mr Oswell and myself to penetrate into his country he evinced gleat anxiety to open up a path for us and not only sent men to search for us along the Zouga but made considerable presents of cattle to lifferent chiefs on the way with the request that they would render us every assistance in their power and furnish us with guides He even came nearly 390 miles southwarls and would have come further in order to be near to us and to English traders When we met he seemed overjoyel alld having renlarked that our cattle had been bitten by the fly and would certainly lie sail  Alever mind I have plerlty aind will give you as lnany as you need He then appeared anxious to remove us to the N or the safe side of the Chobe and aso to be near his to7n Of Linyarlti but when he saw that our waggons were too large for his canoes he ordered the people of the town to relnove to our restingplace A few days afterwards however and when the nesv village was quickly springing up he became ill and after lingering a fortnigilt to our great regret died Hs people receixred our condolence and advice in a friendly manner and requested us not to leave them but treat his cilildren as we1G6 OS WELI nd LIYINGSTON s ESP70atT0nS should have done had Sebitoane been still alive His dflughter MamochishaneS who succeeded him in the chieftainship being still at tbe head town of the Borotse a distance of 12 days or nearly 200 miles froln the waggons double that time was required to open up a communication with her She was reported to be in childbed at the timea but sent the chief next in authoritv to herself to visit us on her behalf E1is instructionswere to treat us as kindly as if her father were still alive arld full permission was granted for us to proceed wherever we wished to go We then rode abQUt 100 miles on horseback to the NtE and were well rewarded by a sight of the great river called SeshekeS in lat 17 28 S A variety of considerations all of which we had pre viously weighed3 induced us on our return to the waggons to decide on starting for the Cape OI1 our return we went along the Mabab and Tamunakle and after crossing the Zouga fUll in with ollr old road to the Lake Before detailing the information which our two monthss sojourn on the Chohe enabled us to collect I may remark that the open ing up of a path from either the E or the W coast to the centre of the continenta prominent feature in all our plansS would be a worthy subject for the consideration of the Royal Geographical Society and for such an undertaking I know no one better suited than my friend Mr Oswell He has courage and prudence equal to any emergency and possessesn moreover that qualification so indispensabl3 in a traveller of gainillg the con fidence of the natives while maintaining the dignity of a gentleman rhe following information derived partly from the nativesS who came in great numbers to see tbe white strangers and partly from our own observation will prove of service to any one who may wish to visit the country The extensive region to the N NE and NW of the Chobe and

contaixling nothillg lout sand and stones on the contraryy all those which camc under ur observation here contained large solumes of water and that too flowing with considerable rapidity at the end of an extraor dinarily dry season Yet on sounding the Chobe we found it to have a regular depth of 15 feet on the side to which the water svung and of 12 feet on the calm side The banks below the lol1vest watermark were nearly perpendicular arld the water was as deep a foot from the bank as in the middle of the stream the roots vf the reeds and coarse grass seeming to prevent it from wearing away the banksf which howevery in ulany parts are undermined and overhang the water The lands in this region are raised only a few feet above the prevailing lesTel on wllich the people pasture their cattle make their gardens and build their towns The nvers overflow their banks annually The unusual drought of the season preceding our visit seems to have extended even to the sources of the waters The hobe cught to haYc overflowed irl July and the people ascribed the nonappearance of the waters to the death of their chief But when the rivers do fill the whole collntry is inundated and must present the appear arlce of a vast lakeS with numerous islands scattered over its su face The numerous branches givell of by each of the riversS and the annual overflow of the countryS explain the reports we had heard of 4Linokanoka rivers on rivers7 and  large waten with many islands in them The Chob must rise l O fefet in perpendiculal height before it can reach the dykes made for catching fish which we observed about a zllile from its barlks arld the Sesheke must rise 16 to 20 feet perpendicuarly before it overfows its banks yet we saw anulistakeable cvidenees of its flood extendng 15

sweet potato WVheat maize peach and apricot stones and other garden seeds have been lett with the Makololo as they spontaneously offered to make a garden for our use The moisture from the rivers per nseates the soil rendering constant irrigation unnecessartr and some of the seeds left may vegetate anl increase the food of the inhabitants but of this indeed their stout and healthy appearance indicates no want We ascertained that the hilly parts beyonl were without defence against the Matibele and Mosilekatse constantly makes excursions against them but their OWll deep reedy rivers are safe against inroads Respecting the sources of these rivers we are quite in the dark The Makololo have ascerlded the Sesheke or as it is otherwise called the Borotse River at least 400 miles above the town to which our journey extended Its general course may be inferred from their statement that when ascending it  the sun rose on one cheek and set on the other But some in drawing maps for us gave it a little Westing In lat 17 21 S it contains a volume of water of from 400 to 500 yards broad and though we saw white banks of sand in it the depth was evidently consider able The name Sesheke refers to these banks of white sand Alligators and hippopotami abounl in it A series of rapids situated abve the town of Sesheke compels the boatmen to drag their canoes some distance along the shore and at about 80 miles below the same point a waterfall is reported the spray and noise arising from which are so considerable as to have led to the name Mosi oa tunya smoke sollnding The spray is said to be visible 10 lniles oR This waterfall may have prevented the slave dealer from sailing up this river which we believe to be the main branch of the Zambesi for it is a fact to which all the natives bore uniform testimony that the slavetrade only beyan on the SesAzeAe in 1850 At the falls the river is narrowed by means of rocks It soon however spreads out and becomes placid again The natives who have been to the eastward know of the Sesheke being joined by another river at about a months distance from the town which beyond the junction assumes the name Zambesa or Zambesi The large river referred to is called the Bashuku lompo or Maninche but it is only 80 or lO0 yards wile A great many branches as the Loi Lombe Njoko Majeele c counect the Maninche with the Sesheke rhese are incerted ininto Central Africa 169 the map as given by the natives but even beyond the point where these streams empty themselves into it the Sesheke must be a large river for Seunturu the Borotse chief expelled by Sebitoane built a large boat of planks sewrl together which was roofed in with white cloth so that bis people might see it at a great dis tance and it required twenty men to paddle it The best informed natives can givfe no information as to whence the supply of water comes which these rivers convey with considerable velocity to the E The usual answer to our inquiries was  The water comes bom Lobale And what is Lobale The source of the waters Lobala in Sichuana means a large plain without trees but whether Lobale means an expanse lake or a province we could not determirle The Loena Liambae and Lonta are said to be large rivers and the inhabitants possess many canoes The Lollta contains lihtcoloured water the Liambae clear water and both flow for some distance in the same channel after their jlmetion side by side and unmixeci The water of the Sesheke is hard but clear and does not readily form a lather with soap The water of the Chobe is clear and as soft as that of the Zouga The ralnunakle and the fTeoge had their annual rise in June and JulyS while as we had an opportunity of observing tbe Chobe was unaffected or rather fell slightly 1 inches during the same period The scurces of the Chobe and Zouga c would there fore appear to be distinct A good highway into a large section of this continent is now opened to our viewv and any one may travel for hundreds of miles unmolested The country around Libabe is reported very swampy or rather boggy for people not unfre quently slip through the crust of earth which covers the ullder lying waters and perish Near to the hill Sorila on the Embarrah a waterfall is reported but the natives of the country oppose any path being made in that direction The people of these regions are black totally distinct from the Bechuanas Those of Sebitoane are called Makololo The black race which he found illhabiting the numerous islands consists of tribes of different names as Borotse Manyeti Batoka Ba3huku lompo c Being the victorious party the Sichuana is the lan guage of the court The Bible is being translated into that language and Providellce has prepared the way for it Besides Sichuana there are the different dialects of the black race inha biting the country and though some of the radicles show them to be of the same family of language3 as the Sichuana none of the Becllualla could lmderstand it To judge frorn a comparison between 300 words of the Bayeiye or Bakoba and about an equal  Mr Oswell thinks that there may be some connexion between the nlmes of the R Lobali and of the Portuguese provillce of

Sichllana the former bear about the same relation to the latter that provincial English does to broad Scotch We found every where people who could understand us These backs designate the Supreme Being by the narne of Nyampi or Reza which latter is identical with the Oreeja of the Bayaye The Borotse are very ingenious in basketmaking and woodwork generally The Banyeti are excellent smiths making ox and sheep bells spears knixres needles and hoes of superior workmanship Iron of ex cellent quality abounds in their country which they extract from the ore They are famed as canoebuilders also and the abun dance of a light strog kind of wood called Molompi enables them to excel in this branch of industry Other tribes are famed for their skill in pottery their country yields abundance of native produce but though they are stoutly lnade especially their upper extremities they seem never to have been addicted to war but appear to have trusted to the defences which their deep reely rivers affiord to their numerous populations In constructing the rough sketch of their country only the largest towns are given Scores of the people were employed by Mr Ossell and myself at diffierent times and as their accounts generally agree we consider that we give an appPoximation to the truth The size of the towns as irldicated in their drawings derives additional confirma tion from the fact that in our ride to Sesheke we saw several villages of from 300 to 500 inhabitallts each which were not enumerated by our informants being in their estimation too srxlall to mention The Batoka and Bashukulompo follow the curious custom of knocking out the upper front teeth at the age of puberty tbe lower incisors being relieved from the pressure of the upper become long and press out the lower lip svhile the upper lip falling in gives to the countenance a sort of gaberlunzie appearance European manufactures in considerable quantities find their way from both E and NV coasts to tlle centre of the continent We were amused soon after our arrival at the Chobet by seeing a black gentleman walk towards us in a gaudily coloured dressinggown and many of the lMakololo possessed cloaks of blue green and red baize or of diffierent coloured prints On inquiry we foulld that most of these had been obtained in exchange for slaves and that the traic began on the Sesheke only in 1850 A party of an African tribe called Mambari visited Sebitoane during that year with considerable quantities of English manufactured cloth and a few old Portuguese guns narked Legitimo de braga and they refusell everything in ex  hange except boys of about fourteen years of age The Makololo viewed the traffic with lislike but ilaving great llumbers of theinto Central Afriecz 171 black race livint in subjection to them they were too easily per suaded to give these for the guns Eight of these old useless instruments were purchased by Sebitoane for as many boys They then incited the Makololo to go on a razzia against the Bashukolompo stipulating beforehand that in consideration for the use to be made of their guns in the attack on the tribe they should receilre all the captured slaves while they the Makololo should have all the cattle While on this expedition the Mako lolo met some Portuguese or bastarl Portuguese slavedealers on the Bashukulompo or Maninche river They were said to be as white as we were our complexion being then a shade or two deeper than washleather and they had straight but short hair These traders presented three English mllskets to the Makololo in exchange for about thirty captives The Mambari went of to the N0v with about 200 slaves the other party towards the E coast but both were so well pleased with their new customers as to promise to return in 1851 The Mambari are said to live in the vicinity of the sea to the W The other party came up to the Zambesi from the sea on the E If traders from Europe woull come up the Zambesi the slavedealer might soon be tlriven out of the learket We were informed of the existence of a large water or lake called Sebolemokoa in the direction usually given as that of Lake Maravi Tanganna  Many slaves come from that qual ter and the goods employed in the traffic probably go up the Zambesi Can English traders not equal slavedealers in enterprise Any party pos sessing sufficient energy woull reap abundantly fol since we opened up a way to the river Zouga considerable profits have been made We know ot 900 elephants having been killed on the Zouga in the space of three years and previous to our arrival no use whatever was made of the ivory but on the rivers indi cated in my ulap armlets are made of the ilrory half an inch of which is lost in the process of lnaking the saw used being a quarter of an inch in diameter and armlets of brass wire wollld be pre ferred by the natives Tusks called by the people  Marapshela or bones rtlay even now be seen coulpletely spoiled by sun and rain lying with the

according to Cummings account 3000 per cent call be made by the trade in arms it is in vain to attempt to stop it The result however of all our observations in this matter is that the irltroduction of firearms amollg the blacks has ploduced the same effect as it did amon the whites It puts an end to most of their petty wars and renders such as do occur much less bloody than they formerly were Should any one be disposed to establish a trade on the Zambesi let it be par ticularly borne in miIld that June July and August are the only safe months we at present know We arrived on the Chobe in July and had frost but the winter is very short We observed swalows on tlle Sesheke ill the beginning of August and the trees generally speaking never lose their leaves The bite of the tsetse fly is fatal to nearly all domestic animals yet when allowed to settle on the hand all it is observed to do is to insert its prqboscis a little farther in than seems necessary to reach the blood It then withdraws it a little the proboscis assunzes a crimson colour the mandibles appear in operation the shrunken boly swells and in a few seconls the animal becomes quite full and quietly leaves Its size is almost that of the com mon blue flv which settles on meat but the wings are longer In the ox the following symptoms are produced by the bite of the insect The eye runs the glands under the jaw swell the coat loses its gloss there is a peculiar flaccidity of the uluscles gene rally and emaciation commences which proceeds unchecked until perhaps months after the bite purging supervenes and the animal perishes of extreme exhaustion Some die soon after the bite is inflicted especially if they are in good condition or should rain fall but in general the process of emaciation goes on for months I had a horse which perished five months after being exposed to the insect When the animal is destroyed in consequerlce of not being able to rise the following appearances may be observed The cellular tissue urlder the skin is ilJjected with air and the surface of the body presents the appearance of a number of soapbubbles strewed over the carcase the fat is of a greenishyellow colour and of oily consistence The muscles are flabby and the heart fiequelltly pale and softened The lungs have diseased patches on their surface of a pink or grey colour the liver is frequently diseased and the gall bladder always elistended with bile The stomach presents no particular appearance but the small intestines are pale and generally ernpty The blood is remarkably small in quantity and so devoid of colouring matter that it scarcely stains the hands The poison seems to be of the nature of a ferinent capable of propagating itself and acts principally on the braininto Central Africcl 173 heart lungs and liver The brain seemed affected in several by the circulation of the morbid fluid for the anilnal became U11 steady in its gait and sometimes even blind The tsetse is fatal only to domestic animals as the wild feed in parts infested by it quite undisturbed There are large tribes which cannot keep either cattle or sheep because the tsetse abounds in their country yet it bites man and no danger follows Our cllildren lived for two months among the tsetse and were frequently bitten but suffered no harm while we lost most of our best oxen after having been in contact Witll the fly on only one or two occasions We leave seen zebras buialoes and antelopes feeding unlisturbed in the vicinity of our waggons on the Chobe quite unmolested by the tsetse wilich buzzed around them Oxen and buSaloes horses and zebras antelopes and goats jackals and dogs possess somenvhat of the same nature What is there in domestication which renders domestic animals obnoxious to the poison  Is man not as much a domestic animal as a dog  Is it the tsetse at all which kills the animals  Captain Vardon of theX Indian army decicled this point for he rode a horse up to a hill infested by tsetse and in ten days his doubts were removed by the death of his horse A curious feature in the case is that dogs though reared on milk die if bitten while calves are safe so long as they suck the cow A dog reared on the meat of game may be hunted in tsetse districts in safety The tsetse only inhabits par ticular localities well known to the natives Is there any anti septic in the fluids of game and man which does not esist in the fluids of tame animals or in those of dogs reared on milk  EXTRACT from a letter received by Mr Oswell from Mr Livingston dated Cape Town April 27 1852  Captain Tuckey

CaPt M H SYNGE RE FRGS Read Jan 12 arld 26 1852 THE proposed communication consists of component parts each of which is in itself complete alld independent opening a new and distinct feature of the country and forming separately a profit able and reproductive work Each part is characterised by these distinctive features and by marks of superiority over com peting routes similar to those which distinguish the entire pro posed interoceanic communication Every part of the chain may therefore rely on its intrinsic merits and is capable of separate execution That execution would however be the most profitable and for every reason the most desirable which wollld most speedily open the country and effect the communication the whole way to the Pacific An examination of the globe shows that the entire route as connecting Europe with the Pacific and the East is shorter in proportion as it is northerly Thus one through the United States is shorter than one through Central America and one through British America shorter than one through the United States Equal facilities existing for crossing the respective transcontinental portions of these routes it necessarily follows that the shortest can also be most quickly traversed These and other important advantages belong equally to tlle several parts Yvhich form the route through British America The comparison presents the same result through every link and feature but the detailed examination of vast tracts of country which it would require involves so many points of physical special and political geo graphy that to be at all adequately dealt with they must be treated as separate though subordinate and related subjects  It must suffice briefly to remark that no route can be carried out within the United States by similar natural advantages That which is universally allowed to be the best that could be formed there is longer by the inferior position of the Atlantic seaboard within their territories and extenals to the same termination of

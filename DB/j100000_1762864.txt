the face were represented by a greasy cinder re taining the cast of the features and the incinerated mustache still gave the wonted military expression to the old soldier The soft tissues were almost entirely consumed On my return from other work later on I found that the whole had been removed The bearers told me that the whole body had collapsed when they had tried to move it en masse From the comfortable recumbent at titude of the body it was evident that there had been no death struggle and that stupefied with all the whiskey within and the smoke without the man had expired without suffering the body burning away quietly all the time THE SUPPRESSION OF SMALLPOX  An outbreak of small pox is reported to have occurred recently in Minneapolis and the healthofficer of that city is credited with having summarily and successfully dealt with it According to The Journal of the American Medical Association as soon as a case was announced a consultation was called to determine if the disease was smallpox That being settled the patient was removed to the quarantine hospital for treatment The house where he lived was quarantined and all the people directly exposed were confined in it Dr Kil vingtons assistants then began to look up all people indirectly ex posed and vaccinated them Quarantine houses had guards stationed about them who allowed no one to go in or out during the season of quarantine The quarantine people were vaccinated and during the time until it could be determined whether the vac cination would take they were supplied with food When the vaccination took the person under quarantine was bathed given new clothing in the place of the old which was burned and he was then discharged When a house had been emptied of people under quarantine the bedding and curtains were burned sulphur burned in all the rooms and the walls sprayed with corrosive sub limate None of the inspectors or guards were allowed to enter any of the houses under quarantine when there was danger and the doctors that did the vaccinating saturated thezir clothzng with the corroszive sublimate before and after enterzng a house where there had been smallpox The clothing and bedding were either paid for at a reasonable price by the board of health or were re placed by new articles In one of the houses quarantined there were 31 laborzng men who were inclined to object to the rules of quarantine One escaped but he was taken back when found and a guard with a rifTe and instructzons to shoot should he at tempt to escape was put over him Since Jan 13 six thousand people have been vaccinated and the schools public and private have been systematically visited and unvaccinated children vac cinated The absurdity of saturating the clothing of the vacci nators before and after entering each house where there had been smallpox is selfevident Nor do we believe that in this enligh tened age any guard would be instructed by a healthofficer to shoot a laboring man who after being shut up forcibly in a house where a case of smallpox had been should attempt to escape especially when the house had been disinfected and the man himself vac cinated The account above given must we think have been ob tained from some source outside the healthoffice of Minneapolis ELECTRICAL NEWS CanalBoat Propulsion A PAPER read by Mr H C Vogt at the last meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science brought out some interesting and remarkable facts It gave the results of some experiments made with airpropellers at Copenhagen A steam launch was fitted with a windmill with steel blades carried on a frame above the deck and provided with steam machinery to rotate it The London Electrical Review in describing the experiment and suggesting a modification of the method says that at first sight the method would seem an extremely inefficient one as regards ap plication of power to so unstable a medium as the air but when it is remembered that recent investigations of the marine propeller have established it as a true reaction engine in which a large slip is not necessarily an accompaniment of inefficiency it will ap iNCE VOL XIII No 323 pear that there is nothing wrong in the principle indicated by Mr Vogt An airpropeller is a pure momentum or reaction machine Practically it was found that a twentyfoot launch of five and a half feet beam could be driven at a speed of five knots per hour in calm weather and against a fresh breeze at four knots The engine producing this effect indicated one and onehalf horsepower For a single indicated horsepower the thrust of the propeller was 367 pounds or about the same as a waterpropeller It might be supposed that in a contrary wind this thrust would disappear but on the contrary through 75 per cent of the horizon the thrust was found to be augmented by the wind With a larger launch hav ing a displacement of five tons a speed of over six knots an hour was obtained against the wind In some of the trials canvas covered wings were used but they were found inferior to steel To replace the steamengine used in these experiments the Re view suggests an airpropeller carried well above the decks on a standard driven by an electric motor which is carried on top of the frame supplied with current from a wire running along the canal and connected with the motor through flexible conductors and a carriage travelling on the main wire The blades of the propeller should be of steel accurately shaped and arranged to be turned at a greater or less angle according to the direction of the wind Thus equipped a canalboat could make her way with a speed ex ceeding that generally used and with no greater proportionate ex penditure of power than that existing in all cases where the trolley system of actuating electric motors is in use The advantages of the system are obvious The hull of the vessel would be entirely clear of machinery and the entire weight of the propelling apparatus carried by the boat need not exceed that of an ordinary tow rope No disturbance of the water of the canal would be produced except such as would be due to the pro gressive movement of the hull of the vessel It would seem as though in this suggestion might be found a solution of the me chanical driving of canalboats  one that from the points of view of simplicity nonoccupancy of the hull of the boat and minimum disturbance of the water would be nearly perfect The airpropeller works with an entire absence of vibration It requires ten or twelve times the area of the corresponding water screw As the thrust is a perfectly quiet one and if due to the motion derived from a dynamo would be free from the jarring in separable from the motions of a heavy reciprocating engine and as it is cushioned in all its motions by the high elasticity and mo bility of the air a very light frame would serve to carry the wheel A thrust of 75 to 150 pounds would be all that the frame would be required to resist a thrust that would always be brought on it gradually and would be gradually released In steam canal boats a very considerable portion of the hull is occupied by the engine boilers and coalbunkers while the constant eddies and currents produced by the propeller are destructive in their effect on the sides and bottom of the canal This is all done away with in aerial propulsion The establishment of a line of poles and wire would not represent the tithe of the cost of a fixed or travelling towingcable INFLUENCE OF LIGHT ON MAGNETISM A preliminary notice of a very interesting experiment has been given by Mr Shelford Bidwell The investigation was undertaken to determine whether a piece of iron could be magnetized by allowing a ray of light to fall on it Of course if light is an electrical vibration and if an ef fect was sought using an ordinary piece of iron there would be no result since the opposite vibrations would exactly neutralize each others effects But iron can be prepared so that it is more sus ceptible to a magnetic force acting in one direction than to one acting in the other Ewirfg has shown that if a piece of iron which is being magnetized in what we call the positive direc tion has the magnetizing current reduced to zero at such a point in the operation that the current and the magnetization of the iron become zero at the same instant then that piece of iron although apparently in a neutral condition is more susceptible to a negative than to a positive magnetizing force So if a piece of iron pre pared in this way be submitted to the action of a ray of light the positive and negative magnetizing forces produced although equal will not balance with one another but the latter should produce an effect On trying the experiment in this way Mr Bidwell ob SCIENCE tained a sudden throw of the magnetometerneedle denoting the magnetization of the iron followed by a slower motion due prob ably to the heating effect of the light While Mr Bidwell does not consider the results as altogether free from suspicion until all possible disturbing causes have been eliminated yet if further re search confirms the results already arrived at the experiment is most important The last year has added many proofs of the fact that light is an electromagnetic disturbance but none are so con clusive as this would be THE PURIFICATION OF SEWAGELast year we described the plan proposed by Mr W Webster for the purification of sewage by electrolytic methods It has been since tried on a large scale and with encouraging results The process is very simple and is described by the London Electrician as follows The color density and constitution of the London sewage varies from hour to hour in the most extraordinary manner but the first sample to be dealt with was of a lightyellow color looking something like weak tea with a little milk in it but so far as could be seen it contained very little solid matter in mechanical suspension This having been poured into a testjar a current was passed through it between a pair of iron electrodes with about six volts electro motive force An extremely rapid effect was produced In less than two minutes the jar was seen to be filled with a flocculent precipitate which was gradually carried upward by the bubbles of liberated hydrogen After about three minutes the electrodes were withdrawn and the precipitate left to collect at the top In actual practice after the effluent has passed into the settlingtank the precipitate in the course of about two hours loses the whole of the entangled hydrogen it then sinks to the bottom of the tank The sludge thus formed is similar to that produced by the chemi cal processes now in use except that the electrical method pos sesses the obvious advantage that the total quantity of material has not been increased by the addition of chemicals But besides this precipitation there is an action on the organic matters in solu tion which robs them of their unpleasant and harmful properties In the larger experiments carried on at Crossness two 20horse power engines are used with an EdisonHopkinson dynamo Iron plates are placed in the shoot through which the sewage is dis charged In travelling along the shoot every particle of the sew age comes in contact with the plates and finally the whole is received into the settlingtanks With 27 horsepower it is pos sible to treat a million gallons of sewage in twentyfour hours The consumption of iron in actual working is about two grains per gallon Taking a town with a daily flow of ten million gallons of sewage a day  corresponding to a population of about 300000 the consumption of iron should not exceed 304 tons per annum and the steamplant required would be about 250 This plant takes the place of the mixingtanks machinery and chemicals em ployed in the chemical process for the purification of sewagie and if such electrical plant is designed to meet the peculiar require ments of the district it should cost less than any other method besides precipitating and purifying in one operation SECONDARY BATTERIES  We are informed that in the United States Circuit Court April 9 Judge Coxe approved of the dis claimer filed by the Electrical Accumulator Company and formu lated the decree and injunction restraining the Julien Electric Company their officers agents and workmen from further manu facture use or sale of secondary batteries of the Faure type in which the active material is applied to the support in the form of a paint paste or cement NOTES AND NEWS THE Atlantic Pilot Chart for April says of whirlwinds waterspouts and tornadoes that these phenomena are of the same general character and it has been found that whenever they occur it is in connection with a general cyclonic storm of large area The principles involved in their formation are almost identical with those that determine the formation of a tropical cy clone that is great contrasts of temperature and moisture be tween adjacent layers of air In the United States and off our coasts they may therefore naturally be expected to occur to the 279 southward of a stormcentre where cold dry northerly winds blow over and mingle with warm moist air from the southward That they may occur to the north of a stormcentre however under cer tain conditions is indicated by a report from Second Officer Madge of the British steamship  Lake Winnipeg Capt Murray This vessel encountered a severe cyclonic storm Feb 27 latitude 40Q 50 north longitude 56 48 west and at 230 PM when it was blow ing a strong gale from the east a whirlwind was observed moving due west The barometer was low and the warm moist east wind was evidently underrunning a cold dry current of air from the area of high barometer to the northward where readings of 304 inches and upward are reported It will thus be seen that local conditions of pressure temperature and moisture may cause exceptions to the general rule The lectures to the summer class in botany of the College of Pharmacy of the City of New York by Professor Joseph Schrenk commenced Wednesday April 10 and will be continued every Wednesday until the end of June By request of several members of former botany classes Professor Schrenk will also give a course in practical microscopy The Essex Institute of Salem Mass was organized March i I848 under a charter granted by the Legislature in February of that year having for its objects the collection and preservation of whatever relates to the geography antiquities and civil and eccle siastical history of Essex County the formation of a cabinet of natural productions in general and more particularly those of the county the promoting a taste for the cultivation of choice fruits and flowers its three departments then being history natural his tory and horticulture The scope of the institute has been from time to time enlarged and there are now departments of history science literature art and horticulture The library of the insti tute which in 1848 numbered fifteen hundred volumes now num bers fiftyone thousand volumes and embraces all the departments of literature but is mostly useful for reference A readingroom is the latest addition to the library department and this is well supplied with historical scientific and art periodicals besides the usual magazine literature of the day The museum of the institute now contains a large and valuable collection of antiquarian and historical relics portraits paintings engravings medals coins paper currency manuscripts etc and is in process of systematic arrangement The scientific collections which before I867 had grown to be so large and of such value that it was impossible for the institute at that time to bear the expense of properly caring for and exhibiting them were by agreement entered into between the institute and the trustees of the Peabody Academy of Science in May I867 deposited with the lastnamed institution where prop erly labelled arranged and preserved they are made available to the public and form an attractive feature of the academys museum at East India Marine Hall The publications of the institute regu larly issued are the Historical Collections which have now reached Vol XXV The Bulletin which has reached Vol XXI and con tains records of the regular meetings and fieldmeetings of the institute and special papers on scientific subjects the Annual Re port besides occasional monographs etc The rooms of the in stitute contain portraits of the officers of the Essex Historical and Essex County Natural History Societies the forerunners of the institute old prints silhouettes a great number of interesting relics historical portraits by Copley Smibert Trumbull and oth ers antique furniture local relics and military costumes A fireproof room holds the large and invaluable collection of manu scripts The meetings of the institute are held on the first and third Mondays of every month During the winter months papers are read and fieldmeetings are held throughout the county every summer for scientific and historical investigation and discussion Without considerable endowments in the past the institute has been able to do for the civil history and archasology of Essex County  and no other county in America offers a better field for such research  what has been so well done for the natural history of the county a cherished object of the institute by the well equipped and earnest workers of the Peabody Academy of Science With largely increased facilities and resources which it owes to the general appreciation of its work it is now ready to go forward as APRIL 12 1889

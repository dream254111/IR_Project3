j100358,The School Review,1074447,Change in Entrance Requirements to Vassar College,i244494,THE SCHOOL REVIEW grammatical relations in English is especially difficult because of our lack of inflections in this respect the diagram appealing to the eye is a sort of substitute for the inflections of foreign languages This is its chief psychologic value rendered in no respect invalid because it does not portray the historical development of the sentence Basing our opinion upon some twenty years of observation and experience we reiterate the statement of Superintendent Perry of Ann Arbor that It is not too much to say that grammar as a productive study has been made possible in the seventh and eighth grades by the diagram 3 In high schools and in normal schools with large classes the diagram is an indispensable aid in the rapid conduct of recitation and to the teacher overburdened with much manuscript it is a sort of godsend as a system of stenography That we may not seem to have overlooked the disadvantages which we have not space to discuss allow us as a final word to say that before the County Commissioners of the state as well as the Schoolmasters Club we frankly admitted that owing to the abuses of the diagram arising from faulty teaching it is a fair question whether as an instrument of instruction it has not done quite as much harm as good in the public schools of the state We are convinced however that the disadvan tages are not inherent in the system itself but that they are due rather to abuses which it is the duty of sound pedagogy to correct Very truly yours F A BARBOUR MICHIGAN STATE NORMAL SCHOOL CHANGE IN ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS TO VASSAR COLLEGE We take pleasure in calling attention to an important step that has just been taken by Vassar College and cannot refrain from printing President Taylors note accompanying the statement because the spirit it shows of appreciation of school problems will be grateful to all secondary teachers ED SCHOOL REVIEW Editor of the School Review May I send you a statement of what we have agreed to accept in place of the third language which is required for admission here  We have been strongly impressed by Mr Nightingales direct words to our alumnae at our meeting in Chicago and by the article in the SCHOOL REVIEW and we have decided to go to this 242ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS TO VASSAR COLLEGE length at least in making it easier for the schools to meet the college requirement I hope that this will fall in somewhat with the ten dencies that we are all making toward uniformity I believe in the school side of this question as well as the college side Yours truly J M TAYLOR President Vassar College Any student presenting herself for admission to Vassar College may offer instead of the third language required the following work in physics and chemistry A years work in either subject that is five periods a week not less than two of which shall be given to laboratory work The certifi cate privilege shall not be understood to cover laboratory work but this shall be judged on the basis of the original laboratory notes of the student A candidate may also gain exemption from the requirement in a third language by presenting at entrance an additional year of work above the regular entrance requirement in the second language offered but it must be understood that no certificate of a school will be accepted for this year of advanced work and that when this work is presented in lieu of entrance requirement it shall not be credited as college work toward a degree 243

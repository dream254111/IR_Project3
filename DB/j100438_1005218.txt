and Marlin H Boye Read May 29 1843 THE importance of the application of chemical principles to the various processes in the animal economy not less than their interesting character in a scientific point of view having led us to undertake a few experiments on a singular fact observed some years since by Woehler we have deemed them worthy of being offered to your notice on the present occasion although time has failed in completing the series of investigations which was contemplated I therefore propose to offer you a few remarks on the Conversion of Benzoic into Hippuric acid which are the results of the conjoint labours of Professor Booth and myself Before entering into the details of the present treatise it may not be out of thle way to make a few remarks on some of the most important ingredients of urine as far as con nected with the present subject urirne contains about ninetythree parts of water and seven of solid substances Of these seven parts of solid substances a substance called urea forms three parts About two parts are formed by inorganic substances such as chlorides of potassium sodium and ammonium suiphates of soda and potassa and the phosphates of lime magnesia soda and ammonia while the remaining two parts are mostly formed of other organic substances as extractive matters mucus of the bladder some lactic acid and uric acid Urea is in every respect the most remarkable substance in the urine and that which imparts to it its most peculiar characters It is a white crystallizable substance and very soluble in water It seems to stand on the borders between organic and inorganic sub stances It may be produced artificially from inorganic substances and is itself readily converted into carbonate of ammonia by taking up the elements of one atom of water It combines with some acids such as the nitric and oxalic acids and performs in these compounds the part of a base Lithic or uric acid forms only a very small part of the urine being about oneseventieth of the solid substances and only oneten thousandth part of the whole urine It is very insoluble in water and this is the reason that it for the most part deposits from urine on cooling By oxidation it yields among other products urea It forms the greater part of urinary concretions VOL IX 50186 ON THE CONVERSION OF The urine of herbivorous animals does not contain any uric acid but another acid called hippuric acid from t7t7Cos a horse in whose urine it was first discovered It only contains seven per cent of nitrogen while uric acid contains thirtythree per cent By oxidation it yields among other products benzoic acid The urine of the horse sometimes contains benzoic acid inistead of hippuric Ben zoic acid is generally obtained fromc gumbenzoin by subjecting it to a gentle heat when it sublimes in crystalline needles It will be observed that it contains no nitrogen It belongs to a series of compounds which in a historical point of view are of interest as containing the first well established radical in organic chemistry that is to say an ima ginary body which though never isolated by itself may be carried through a series of combinations with most of the simple elementary bodies The question now naturally arises how is this transformation of benzoic acid into hippuric effected We have seen that the normal quantity of uric acid is too small to suffice if its formation depended on this acid and besides their formation seems indepen dent of each other That the transformation should be effected in the stomach and in testines during the digestion is less probable it seems more probable to suppose that it takes place during the subsequent circulation of the blood and that its formnation is con nected with that of the urea We know that at least the principal source of urea is the transformation of the tissues in the body or what Prout calls the destructive assimilation since its formation continues wlhen animals are fed exclusively on nonnitrogenized food and when they are starved and that it is not secreted by the kidneys but actually formed in the body and merely excreted by them is proved by removing them when urea will be found in the blood The same occurs by suppression of urine I have myself lately had an opportunity to confirm this observation in examining at the request of Drs Pepper and Sargent the blood of a patient who for some time previous to her death had a complete suppression of the urine But the question then isis it merely a sirnple chemical reaction between the benzoic acid and the products of the transformations of the tissues or does it actually affect the chemical changes by which the latter are effected so as to cause new chemical products to be their results Liebig takes this latter view in his Animal Chemistry We quote his own words Benzoic acid when administered internally appears in the form of hippuric acid Should the observation be confirmed it will acquire great physiological significance since it would plainly prove that the act of the transformation of the tissues in the animal body under the influence of certain matters taken in the food assumes a new form with respect to the products which are its results for hippuric acid conitains the elements of one at of urea one of lactic acid and two of benzoic acid Liebig then at once proceeds to make an application of this fact to the action of medi cinal agents We are not disposed to dispute his theories on this point nor deny that such may be the case in active remedies but we believe that he is too prompt in drawing the conclusion that because benzoic acid is converted into hippuric by entering into the system it should therefore necessarily affect the usual chemical changes in the body We are disposed to consider it as a mere chemical reaction between the benzoic acid and the substances of the blood either those which are used for the formation of the tissues or more probably those which result from their dissolution But if this be correct it fobBENZOIC INTO HIPPURIC ACID 187 lows that we may be able to perform the same transformation out of the body It was with a view of determining this point that our experiments were undertaken and we still look for success although they have not hitherto afforded a satisfaictory result Woehler was the first to observe that benzoic acid when administered internally to a dog and again separated from the urine reappeared as prismatic crystals unlike benzoic acid and he conjectured correctly from their resemblance to hippuric acid that the former by passing through the system was converted into the latter He also suggested that this might be the source of the hippuric acid in the urine of herbivorous animals since the benzoic acid might be supposed to occur in their food and by the digestion be con verted into hippuric Ure subsequently stated that he had found hippuric acid in the urine of a patient who had taken benzoic acid he also supposed that the uric acid had been employed in this conversion and recommended it as a remedy for calculous concre tions of uric or lithic acid This induced Keller at the instigation of Woehler to make some experiments on this point which he published in Liebigs Annals of Chemistry and Pharmacy He took in the eveningf before bedtime two grammes or about thirtyone grains of benzoic acid and found the next morning on examining the urine that by the addition of chlorohydric acid it deposited long prismatic crystals which it continued to do as long as he continued the use of benzoic acid By redissolving these crystals in hot water and treating them with animal charcoal he obtained them perfectly colourless The crystals thus obtained behaved in all respects like pure hippuric acid They fused easily and by a stronger heat they charred with a smell of oil of bitter almonds and sub limation of benzoic acid He also determined the quantity of carbon which lhe found to agree witlh that of hippuric acid namely 607 per cent while benzoic acid contains 691 per cent of carbon Keller furthermore ascertained that the urine from which hippuric acid had been se parMted deposited a large amount of nitrate of urea on the addition of nitric acid It had also previously deposited uric acid It therefore contained these two usual ingredi ents of uirine He also inferred that since the urine could be inspissated without depo siting hippuric acid before the addition of chlorohydric acid it was evident that the hippuric acid existed in combination with a base As hippuric acid may be said to a certain extent to replace uric acid in the herbivorous mammalia this probably led Ure to the supposition that the uric acid was employed in the conversion of the benzoic acid but Kellers experinment showed that the urine deposited uric acid and that therefore this latter assertion could not be correct We have repeated Kellers experiments anid with the same results We have in gene ral found that after the use of benzoic acid the urine makes a copious deposite of uric acid both in the red or darkcoloured variety and in that of a claycoloured or muddy appearance In one experiment the urine was examiined in the morning when no benzoic acid had been taken It deposited no sediment on cooling and when tested for uric acid by the addition of nitric acid the latter effected after twentyfour hours a deposite of only a few isolated colourless crystals scattered over the inside of the vessel The same day two grammes of benzoic acid were taken immediately after dinner Twenty minutes after wards the urine was voided evaporated to onefourth its volume and chlorohydric acid188 ON THE CONVERSION OF added After the lapse of twentyfour hours it had deposited a precipitate of a aranular appearance and of a very darkred nearly black colour which dissolved with effervescence in nitric acid and on evaporation yielded the beautiful purple colour of purpuric acid It therefore consisted of uric acid Twenty minutes after the first another portion was ob tained which treated in the same way yielded a precipitate in all respects similar to the above Its quantity also had not diminished but besides this precipitate there appeared a moderate quantity of needleshaped crvstals of hippuric acid These experiments evidently show that the formation of hippuric acid does not dinmi nish the quantity of the uric acid and that the formation of the former seems entirely independent and disconnected with that of the latter The urine voided in the morning had a sp gr of 10112 That voided three or four hours after dinner and therefore con taining most of the hippuric acid had a sp gr of 1024 Its colour was but slightly more yellow than the former Distinction is generally made between the urine secreted after fluids have been taken especially on arn empty stomach and that secreted subsequently to the digestion of food The former is much more limpid and tasteless and contains much less of the solid ingre dients It has been found that if any substance be taken under the first circumstances dissolved in the water it passes much more rapidly into the urine where some substances have been detected in the short time of from two to ten minutes after their introduction into the stomiach while when taken with the food they generally require a much longer time for their reappearance in the urine In regard to the time which elapses before the benzoic acid reappears as hippuric it will be seen that in the above experiments it had not yet appeared there in twenty minutes and that forty minutes after being taken its appearance had but fairly commeniced In another experiment where the benzoic acid was taken immediately before dinner a portion of urine obtained immediately after the meal and about thirty minutes after the introduction of the acid yielded when treated as above an abundant crop of crystals It was interesting to ascertain how long the hip puric acid would continue to appear in the urine from the time the benzoic acid was taken In an experiment where two grammes were taken before and two grammes more immediately after dinner the urine secreted from seven to eleven oclock in the evening or from four to eight hours after its introduction contained an abundance of hippuric acid while none could be detected in the urine voided after that time the next morning The quantity of hippuric acid obtained exceeds that of the benzoic acid taken six grammes taken two grammes after breakfast two before and two after dinner yielded in two experiments about eight grammes of crude  hippuric acid or about onethird more than its own weight It was a matter of considerable interest to ascertain with what base the hippuric acid occurred combined in the urine whereby it was held in solution till liberated by an acid The bases occurring in the urine are potassa soda lime magnesia and ammonia Besides these urea seems in some instances to have a basic nature thus in the compounds which it forms with nitric and oxalic acids it evidently acts the part of a base Cap and Henry have asserted that a portion of it occurs combined with lactic acid in human urine and with hippuric acid in urine of the horse and they prescribed a method of forming these two compounds by double decomposition of lactate or hippurate of lime and oxalate ofBENZOIC INTO HIPPURIC ACID 189 urea and they also described the methods by which they had extracted the lactate of urea from human urine and the hippurate of urea from the urine of the horse The former was repeated by Lecanu who could obtain no lactate of urea Cap and Henry replied and gave a new method of obtaining it in crystals by shaking the inspissated urine with a mixture of one volume of alcohol and two volumes of ether and evaporating the solution by heat over sulphuric acid in a closed vessel Very recently Pelouze has shown that neither lactate nor hippurate of urea can be obtained by double decomposition or in any other way and that they therefore do not exist and that Cap and Henry had nothing but urea which had imbibed the acids If hippurate of urea therefore existed it would not be improbable that this acid might occur combined with urea in the urine and in our experiments particular attention was paid to this point The urine was evaporated filtered and further evaporated in a waterbath to a thick syrup and then left at rest for several weeks in the hope that the combination of hippuric acid would crystallize A quantity of crystals appeared which being well drained from the motherliquid were found to contain no hippuric acid They consisted chiefly of chlorides of ammonium and sodium with the phosphates of the same bases The mother liquid on the contrary formed nearly a solid mass when tested for hippuric acid by the ad dition of chlorohydric acid By adding more water and straining the motherliquid from the crystals subsequent addition of nitric acid caused an abundant precipitate of nitrate of urea The main mass of the syrup was now shaken for several days in a closed bottle witlh a mixture of one volume of alcohol and two volumes of ether which were decanted and evaporated by heat over sulphuric acid While concentrating it yielded prismatic crystals and finally the whole was converted into a mass of crystals with but little mothersyrup The crystals were carefully dried between blotting paper They were therefore obtained according to Cap and Henrys directions for extracting the lactate of urea but they proved to be pure urea so that unless the lactic acid has been employed in the formation of hippuric acid lactate of urea is not obtained in this way and at all events it shows that urea is also dissolved by this process The same process of extraction was repeated with a fresh portion of the same mixture and with the same results but the evaporation was not carried so far in order to be able to examine the motherliquid WVe obtained a crop of crystals of pure urea containing no hippuric acid while the motherliquid had a bitterish taste but did not yield hippuric acid by the addition of chlorohydric acid It was therefore evident that the above mixture extracted pure urea while it left behind the combination of hippuric acid We next employed a mixture of equal volumes of alcohol and ether which dissolved a much larger quantity from the original syrup but on evaporation yielded only a slight crop of crystals The greater part of it remained as a thick syrup yielding an abundance of crystals of hippuric acid by the addition of chlorohydric acid but also a large amount of nitrate of urea by the subsequent addition of nitric acid It was therefore evident that the compound of hippuric acid was also extracted by the last treatment and it merely remained to find the base A few drops of the syrups clharred and incinerated left no residue proving the absence of all the fixed bases of the urine The hippuric acid could therefore only be combined with urea or ammonia to ascertain which chloroliydric acid was added to a portion of it and after the separation of the hippuric acid chloride of platinum added which caused a very copious190 CONVERSION OF BENZOIC INTO HIPPURIC ACID precipitate of chloroplatinate of ammonium The addition of nitrate of silver and nitric acid to the liquid proved it to contain a certain amount of chlorine as chloride of ammo nium but much less thani would be able to yield a precipitate so copious as the above We therefore continued the extraction by fresh portions of equal volumes of alcohol and ether and thus succeeded in obtaining a solution that yielded by evaporation a viscid mass which by addition of chlorohydric acid gave an abundance of hippuric acid and by subsequent addition of chloride of platinum a corresponding copious precipitate of chloroplatinate of ammonium but on the addition of nitric acid it yielded no nitrate of urea nor any trace of this substance by evaporation but only copious crystals of chloride of ammonium It was thus made evident that urea is not combined with the hippuric acid but that the base which retains it in solution and with which it is combined is ammonia It also confirms the assertion of Pelouze that hippurate of urea does not exist The results of the foregoing experiments may be summed up thus 1 The formation of uric acid in healthy urine is not affected either in regard to its quantity nor to its external properties in general by the introduction and transformation of benzoic acid into hippuric acid in the system 2 The time required for the benzoic acid to pass through the system and reappear as hippuric in the urine is from twenty to forty minutes after its introduction with food into the stomach Its occurrence continues for four or eight hours but then ceases 3 The quantity of hippuric acid obtained from the urine is greater than that of the benzoic acid taken In round numbers it may be stated to be onethird more 4 Urea is not in combination with the hippuric acid in the urine 5 The base with which the hippuric acid is combined and which keeps it in solution is ammonia

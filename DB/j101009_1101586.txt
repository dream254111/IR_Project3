according to the terms of the State statute In Re West Norfolk Lumber Co D C 112 Fed 769 Acts of BankruptcyAppointment of ReceiverOnly an act declared by the statute of 1898 to be an act of bankruptcy can be so construed If an assignment is not general it is not an act of bankruptcy And the consent of one of the part ners to the appointment of a receiver for the firm does not operate as a general assignmentwithin the meaningof the Bankruptcy Act In Re Gilbert D C 112 Fed 951 Citing In Re Empire Metallic Bedstead Co 39 C C A 372 98 Fed 981 where the following language was used  A petition for the appointment of a receiver is not that proceeding which is universally recognized as an assignnment anid its  equivalency of result if equiva lency exists is not important The bankruptcy statute has said that the one is an act of bankruptcy and has said nothing about the other in direct terms and when acts of bankruptcy are classified as they are in the statute of 1898 it is not the province of a court to enlarge the classification because the omitted class seems to partake of the sin of the named class Duties of Trustees in Collection of AssetsIt is not the duty of a trustee to litigate every question that may be called to his notice by creditors nor should he be permitted by requiring indemnity against costs to cast the risk of controversy upon particular creditors He should be vigilant and attentive and should carry out in strictest good faith the provisions of the Bankrupt Act where they are plainly applicable to estate in his charge In doubtfuil cases he will be guided by

Boarding Stables 108 Fed 271 Per Hallett Dist J orally  The country is full of hotel companies If Congress had intended to bring them within the terms of the Act they certainly would have been mentioned  and as to the saloons there can be no reason for doubt as to them Certainly Congress knew something about thema and if it was intended that they should have the benefit of the Act they would have been mentioned Italics ours ContemptViolation of Injunction OrderWhen assignee of a stock of goods under general assignment had been enjoined by bankruptcy court from disposing of the same and knowledge of the entry of this order had been communicated to him verbally by the attorney for certain creditors who was unable to procure cer tified copies of the order for service such knowledge is sufficient and the assignee proceeding to sell the goods is guilty of contempt In Re Krinsky D C 112 Fed 972 Per Adams Dist J  Levy was notified by an officer of the court that the order had been granted and he was bound to take immediate notice of that fact It is not necessary that he should have been served with a copy of the order if knowledge of its contents came to him otherwise High Inj

and if the fine is not paid within ten days after service of an order hereon he will be committed until it is paid PreferenceSurrender An important ruling upon the oftconstrued section 67 of the Bankruptcy Act is that of In Re Greth D C 112 Fed 978 A creditor received a preference by a confession of judgment which was finally set aside by a State court in a controversy between the creditor and the trustee in bank ruptcy After final judgment therein the creditor proved its claim before the referee in bankruptcy  surrendering the preferences sought by the entering of said bonds Held That the surrender being an enforced one is not within the spirit of the Act sec 57 g which is to discoturage preferences and that the entire claim should be rejected Citing with approval Re Keller 109 Fed 126 It would certainly be wholly inequitable to hold that a creditor who has received a preference from an insolvent debtor can refuse to account therefor and1902 NOTES OF CASES 879 after causing the other creditors the delay cost and expense of litigation after being defeated therein can still prove up his claim and take an equal share in the proceeds of the estate after depleting the same in the manner stated Contesting the claim of the trustee and paying back the preference in obedience to the process of the court is not a surrender within the meaning of clause g of section 57 Therefore there is this difference between a preferred creditor who sur renders the preference and a preferred creditor from whom the preference is recovered by the trustee The former having voluntarily surrendered the pre ference received is entitled to prove up his entire claim and share with the other creditors The latter having refused to surrender cannot prove the claim or share in the estate DischargeAttachment LienA mere discharge of a debt does not discharge a lien securing it When the Bankrupt Act recognizes the lien of an attachment in a State court as valid a discharge does not prevent the attaching creditor from taking judgment in the State court against the debtor in such limited form as may enable him to reap the benefit of the attachmentthat is to be levied only upon the property attached Where by virtue of State exemption laws the vital ele ment of jurisdiction over the specific property and the tlen upon it was lacking in the bankruptcy court when petition filed the lien is not affected by section 67 f of the Act Powers Dry Goods Co v Nelson Neb 88 N W 903 Citing Hill v Hctrding 130 U S 699 Bank v Elliott Wis  85 N XV 417 Mluunson v B R Co 120 Mass 81 21 Am Rep

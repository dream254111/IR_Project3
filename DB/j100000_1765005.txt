reason as the annals of crimes committed during the last sixty sears abundantly prove But these are not the only sources of danger for experience has abundantly shown that the subject himself may be prompted to commit theft and other species of crime after emerging from the hypnotic condition This fact has become the subject of spe cial judicial enactment in several countries Finally the repeated hypnotization of the subject is liable to be followed by more or less dangerous consequences to himself In ordinate emotionality impairment of volition and a tendency to become spontaneously hypnotized or at least excessively drowsy are some of the more obvious features of this posthypnotic condi tion Dr J Leonard Corning has at the present time under his care as we learn from the Medical Record of Nov 8 a gentleman who exhibits this neurosisfor neurosis it certainly is in a strik ing manner He is a man of rare gifts he has maintained and still enjoys a high position in the community and yet his mental decrepitude is so obvious that it is a matter of astonishment that he has been able to disguise its source so long Currently he is regarded as7 a sufferer from mental overwork and Dr Corning confesses that he should have had great difficulty in arriving at the true nature of his difficulties had the patient not confessed that he had been hypnotized scores of times and that his present infirmity had come on as the direct result of these abuses for abuses they certainly were Such a person as this is of course exposed to manifold dan gers for he had become so susceptible that not only is it possible for any one to hypnotize him but he is able without further as sistance to induce in himself the sleeplike state Here then are the more manifest dangers of hypnotism LETTERS TO

31 gives some inter esting observations of his own on the development of righthand edness in an infant He thinks the fact that the right hand began to be used in preference to the left only when the movement re quired an effort is an argument in favor of those  feelings of innervation  whose existence many psychologists disbelieve and challenges me as a disbeliever to explain the phenomena in any other way Why asks Professor Baldwin should the baby prefer her right hand for strong movements unless previous experiences of using both hands had left behind them the sense that the nervous dis charge that actuated the right one was stronger than that which actuated the left  I admit that this is a possible way of explaining the facts but yet if a memory of the previous superior effectiveness of the right hand is what determines now the choice of it for these move ments it does not seem in any way clear that the memory in question need be of the efferent current of discharge the printer has made Professor Baldwin say I afferent instead of effer ent  Why may it not be of the greater promptitude security and ease of the right hands movement as apprehended in an afferent way during previous performances Professor Baldwin gives no grounds for his rejection of this equally possible alterna tive But to my mind it is by no means evident that memories of any sort of past performances play a part in the preference ac corded to the right hand On any theory we have to suppose an tecedently to all memory a natural prepotency in the paths of discharge into the right arm Professor Baldwins own idea that discharges into this arm leave images of their superior strength behind implies that they have greater strength to begin with Why now with this organic peculiarity may they not also have NCE 275 greater readiness to discharge when the stimulus reaches a certain amount He who conceives of the mechanism of all these early movements as in principle the same as that of reflex action ought if he bears in mind the extraordinarily elaborate way in which different stimuli are correlated in the organism with differ ent paths of discharge to have no difficulty in believing the nerves which ran down into the right arm to be on the whole the most permeable paths of exit from the brain of such currents as run in from objects offered to the baby at a certain distance off Grasp ing at such objects was the sort of performance which Professor Baldwin seems most to have observed It is obviously an instinc tive or semireflex act and I should much rather explain it di rectly by connate paths alone than by connate paths plus memo ries plus choice after Professor Baldwins fashion I must therefore conclude that Professor Baldwins observations fail in my opinion to throw any positive light at all on the vexed question of whether we feel our motornerve currents as they pass out of our brain In themselves however these observations seem very interesting as showing how strong stimuli may produce more definitely localized reactions than weaker ones The baby grasped at bright colors with the right hand almost exclusively WILLIAM JAMES Harvard University Nov 5 Mount St Elias As the National Geographic Society will shortly discuss the most recent observations on Mount St Elias with the full data of Messrs Russell and Kerr as a basis I have determined to refrain from taking any part in the newspaper discussion in regard to the height of this mountain or the respective value to be assigned to the different sets of observations due to different observers This is the only scientific method to pursue aDd it is due to those well qualified and energetic explorers that their results when they are finally made known should form the basis of discussion rather than opinions surmises or guesses prior to their final coim putations The only thing which can be definitely stated at present is that they are of the opinion that the mountain is lower than the height of late accepted for it and the very rough pre liminary computation of their observations appears to sustain this view The weight to be assigned to their observations and the final outcome of the revised computations are matters for the future But the article by Professor Heilprin on the Mexican mountains which you have reprinted p 260 under the title of the Cul minating Point of the North American Continent no doubt un intentionally but nevertheless seriously misrepresents the methods by which my results of 1874 were arrived at and in the interest of a clear understanding of the subject it is perhaps desirable that some of its fallacies should be pointed out Professor Heilprin is no geodesist as his discussion of deter minations of heights of over 17000 feet based on a single pocket aneroid barometer is sufficient to show A little inquiry in proper quarters would have made it clear to him that observations taken with such an instrument are far from determinative If they happen to closely approach accuracy it is merely accidental and a range of 500 feet in the results would reflect in no way on the care of the observer or the known reputation of the instru ment They bear to the mercurial barometer much such a rela tion as sextant angles taken at sea for vertical heights do to those taken on land with a vertical circle or geodetic transit This want of familiarity with the subject has led Professor Heilprin into a singular misconception of the relative values of observations cited in my  Report on Mount St Elias printed in the United States Coast Survey Report for 1875 and of the data which are given therein with absolute frankness and full de tail In that report L aimed to embody every thing which might possess even an historic interest and therefore printed results which I stated to be more or less unreliable for reasons which would be accepted by every competent judge of such matters I stated that these results were not adopted by me nor incorporated into the work depending upon observations of a higher class But  276 SCIE Professor Heilprin compares the irregularities of this bad material denounced by me as bad and concludes that it is good evidence for doubting the value of that which was considered to be more reliable Such reasoning obviously affords only a non sequitur I do not think any one who has passed laborious days and nights in the determination of angles by repetition and reversal will agree with Professor Heilprin that the system of  extracting averages is  delusive  and a reference to my report will show that it was a question of comparison of averages with a view to the weighing of methods with which in that instance I was concerned which could hardly delude any one who chose to read what was printed on the pages before him Averages may be made delusive but not when used in this manner In conclusion although the whole subject is one for experts and professional surveyors rather than others I may summarize for those who are interested and unprofessional the main features of what was done in 1874 for the purpose of getting at the height of that unattainable peak In the determination of any height by triangulation there are to be considered the character of the instruments the distance of the peak the vertical angle measured and the refraction of the atmosphere which distorts the line of sight and introduces an error tolerably constant for high angles and short distances in ordinary latitudes but irregular and sometimes very great in an gles measured when the line of sight passes near the surface of the earth especially for long distances and in high latitudes In the case of Mount St Elias the distance depended upon a horizontal triangle observed from two astronomically determined stations giving an astronomical baseline from which the lines converging on the peak were obtained by an astronomical azi muth The value of such an intersection depends somewhat upon the size of the angle which in this case was large nearly 60 The liability to error which very small angles of intersection may introduce was therefore measurably avoided The positions of the ends of the baseline were well determined The circumstances of the observation made at sea were eminently favorable The error of this position could hardly have exceeded three miles on the worst assumption and the error of distance which this would produce in the base of the vertical triangle upon which the height depended was trifling The instruments were firstclass of their kind The vertical angle measured I venture to say is beyond dispute The uncertainty remaining therefore was in regard to the refractiona factor beyond our power to determine and equally undetermined in all observations made to date However the height of Mount Fairweather was tolerably well determined from positions near its base We reasoned the error of refraction might be assumed to be the same for both mountains at the same moment both being visible and not differing very greatly in their distance from our station The difference between the height of Fairweather as measured from near its base and that which we might obtain for it from our Port Mulgrave sta tion might be assumed to be due to refraction and an analogous amount applied to the result for St Elias as a correction for that unknown error This was an assumption of course but a reason able one and was adopted The height of Mount St Elias may very possibly be less than our results would show but that they were likely to be correct within certain limits seemed probable from the fact that angles measured by Malespina in the last century the record of which is fortunately preserved when computed with a corrected baseline in accordance with our observations for the position of the moun tain gave results approximating our ownan apparent confirma tion which was certainly impressive The outline of our proceedings is given as above in entirely untechnical language but those who are professionally qualified to judge the character of such work are confidently invited to ex amine the report itself in the Coast Survey volume for 1875 This is somewhat amplified from the extra advance copies which were distributed before the publication of the volume I make no pre tence to the character of a geodetic expert but the comparatively simple computations contained in this report were prepared and reviewed by those who are and the error if error there be in the NCE VOL XVI No 406 results is due to factors which were entirely independent of

interesting communi cation in Science for Oct 31 on microscopic organisms from the chalk of the Niobrara cretaceous of Kansas I should suppose it to be highly probable that the forms met with by him are as he supposes coccoliths Coccoliths are very abundant in and some times form a notable proportion of the calcareous parts of the Niobrara beds in Manitoba and in Nebraska and are there asso ciated with foratninifera and with rhabdoliths to which latter class the slender rodlike bodies also noted by Professor Willis ton may be referrible Figures and a description of a number of varieties of coccoliths and rhabdoliths from the cretaceous of Manitoba may be found in the Canadian Naturalist for April 1874 p 256 GEORGE M DAWSON Geological Survey of Canada Nov 10 BOOKREVIEWS Races and Peoples By DANIEL G BRINTON New York N D C Hodges 8 175 DR BRINroN has undertaken the difficult task of presenting the whole vast field of anthropological science in a concise and reada ble form and he has admirably succeeded in giving us a book that is attractive and in all its parts suggestive Therefore not only will it prove useful in making the public acquainted with the facts and some theories of ethnological science but it will also incite the painstaking student to more thorough investigation of mooied questions and open new vistas in many fields of research Dr Brintons theories even such as may not appear acceptable are always full of ingenuity and certainly worth the careful atten tion of anthropologists The present book notwithstanding the briefness with which necessarily all problems are treated teems with new ideas and excellent critical remarks In reviewing it we must confine ourselves to selecting a few of the more important points On the whole we might wish that some still very doubt ful theories to which the author adheres were not presented with quite as much assurance as finally settled The introductory chapter on The Physical Elements of Eth nography strikes us least favorably We think that not suffi cient stress has been laid upon the great variations inside each race and that too much is made of the peculiarities of the lower races which in some respects might be called rather exaggerated human types than simian in character The second chapter  The Psychical Elements of Ethnography is a succinct presentation of the chief causes governing the development of society The author distinguishes associative and dispersive ele ments the former including the social instinct language reli gion and arts the latter the migratory and combative instincts Dr Brinton is inclined to consider the sexual instincts and the re sulting parental and filial affections to be the prime cause of asso ciation and rejects all theories based on promiscuity The third chapter will be found full of interest more particularly where the author sets forth his ideas regarding the development of man as well as his classification of mankind Although he knows how F to present his views with much force we cannot consider his description of the earliest stages more than an ingenious hypoth esis because we have so far no means of reconstructing the his tory of the period immediately after man had made his appear ance Dr Brinton believes that mankind during the preglacial period was homogeneous his industries paleolithic with simple implements his migrations extensive his language rudimentary Such speculations can neither be proved nor disproved Even the character of the glacial period as described by Dr Brinton is largely hypothetical He believes the migrations to have been limited at the time the races to be living in fixed areas It seems impossible to fix any period for these events which have certainly taken place at some time The authors general ethnographic classification is based on physical characters According to these he distinguishes Eurafrican Austafrican Asian American and

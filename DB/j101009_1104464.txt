REVOCATION OF DEVISE OF REALTY BY SUBSEQUENT SALERIGHT OF DEVISEE TN UNPAID PUR CHASE MONEY A case which will probably be of interest to Virginia lawyers and involving the construction of  2520 of the Code of Virginia has recently been decided by the Circuit Court of the County of Prince Edward As a petition for an appeal accompanied by the record was presented to the Supreme Court of Appeals first to each of the five judges in vacation and finally before the full court sitting at Staunton in September 1916 and refused and the decree of the lower court confirmed the decision of the Cir cuit Court is now the law of the state and has the same effect as if an appeal had been allowed and the decree of the lower court confirmed by a formal opinion handed lown by the Su preme Court of Appeals The case in question was that of C M Thackston and others v E A Peters Admr argued before Judge George J Hundley of the Circuit Court of the County of Prince Edward and de cided at the May Term 1916 A B Dickinson of Richmond and Watkins  Brock of Farmville attorneys for the complain ants and Coleman Easley  Coleman of Lynchburg attorneys for the defendant The facts briefly are as follows Mrs E A Peters by the second clause of her will which was dated the 2nd day of July 1913 devised to Rosa E Blanton her house and lot on Second Street in the Town of Farmville Va in the following words I give to my dear little friend Rosa Elizabeth Blanton my house and lot on Second Street in the Town of Farmville now occupied by Mr Mason Bliss Subsequently towit on the 9th day of July 1914 the testatrix sold and conveyed to Mason Bliss this identical lot receiving therefor 1500 cash and tak ing from the purchaser five notes of 700 each secured by a deed of trust on the same property The deed and deed of trust were executed contemporaneously Early in February 1915 Mrs2 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S Peters died and the will was duly admitted to probate and Rosa E Blanton the person named in the will qualified as Ad ministratrix c t a and claimed that under the will she was en titled to the five notes or the proceeds thereof the unpaid pur chase money and invoked  2520 of the Code of Virginia to sus tain her position C M Thackston and the other heirs at law of Mrs E A Peters filed their bill in the Circuit Court of Prince Edward County claiming the revocation of the devise by the subsequent sale of the house and lot by the testatrix asking a construction of the will and praying that the notes or the proceeds thereof be turned over to them as the heirs at law and next of kin of Mrs E A Peters As it was conceded that had Mrs Peters soll the land and received the entire consideration thereof in her lifetime the devise would have been revoked the whole ques tion turns on the construction of  2520 of the Code of Virginia which is as follows No conveyance or other act subsequent to the execution of a will shall unless it be an act by which the will is revoked as aforesaid prevent its operation with respect to such in terest in the estate comprised in the will as the testator may have power to dispose of by will at the time of his death Note Ihe words is revoked as aforesaid in this statute have reference to preceding sections with reference to cancellation tearing or etc It seems somewhat strange that this case has never before risen in Virginia It is true that in the case of Cullups v Smith 89 Va 258 this Section of the Code was considered and a subsequent alienation held to be a revocation but there the whole consideration was paid in cash so that the question of the de ferred payments secured by a leed of trust giving the testatrix an interest did not arise Moreover very few of the states seem to have had this question before them It is true that New York had a statute somewhat similar that statute reading as follows A conveyance settlement leedl or other act of a testator by which his estate or interest in the lroperty previously de visel or bequeathed by him shall be alterel but not wholly divested shall not be deemed a revocation of the devise or bequest of such property but such devise or bequest shall 642  JanDEVISEREVOCATION BY SALE pass to the devisees or legatees the actual interest of the estate of the testator which would otherwise descend to his heirs or pass to his next of kin unless in the instrument by which such alteration is made the intention is declared that it shall operateas a revocation of such previous de vise or bequest This New York statute was construed in the case of Adams v Winne 7 Paige 97 in the first paragraph of the syllabus of which reads as follows Where W  by his will devised to his two sons certain portions of his real estate and charged them with the pay ment of his debts and also devised certain portions of his real estate to his two daughters and then gave all the rest of his property to his four children to be equally divided between them and after the making of his will sold and conveyed one of the lots levised to his daughters for 3000 and received on the sale onesixth of the purchase money and a bond and mortgage on the lots sold for the residue and W the testator lied leaving the bond and mortgage uncollected iheld that the sale of the lot and taking back of the bond and mortgage for the purchase money was a revocation of the devise of the lot to the two daughters and that the bond and mortgage passed to the four children un der the residuary clause of the will This case therefore takes essentially the same view as that taken by Judge Hundley in his decision The question is also discussed in Beck  McGillis 9 Barb 5256 Also in McNorton z McNorton 34 N Y 201 See also note of Graham z Birch 28 Am St Rep 3567 1 Jarman on Wills pp 129146 1 Sugden on Vendors 10th Edition p 301 Redfield on Wills 4th Edition p 340 In Virginia the recent case of May v Sherards Legatees 115 Va 617 79 S E 1027 while not directly in point indicates very clearly the attitude of the court In that case a testatrix levised a certain house anI lot in the city of Staunton to be sold and the proceeds paid over to her two nephews She subsequently sold this house and in vested the bulk of the proceeds arising therefrom in a house in the city of Roanoke She took the precaution however to ear mark the transaction by a codicil to her will in which she stated that since writing the will she had sold the house devised and had invested the greater portion of the proceeds in a house in 1917  6432 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S Roanoke Here it appears that the testatrix meant the house in Roanoke to be substituted for the house at Staunton but she did not say so and the court held that by this sale there was a complete revocation and that the devisee took no interest in the Roanoke property Let us glance for a moment at the history of the Virginia Stat ute Under the common law to quote the words of Jarman on Wills 1 Vol p 167 It was essential to the validity of a levise of freehold lands that the testator should be seized thereof at the making of the will and that he should continue so seized without in terruption until his decease If therefore a testator sub sequent to his death by deed aliens land which he had dis posed of by will and afterwards acquired a new freehold estate in the same land such newly acquired estate would not pass by the devise and was necessarily void In fact so far have courts gone in this direction that where a testator parted with the title for any purpose and afterwards before his death again acquired title and died seized of the same land the revocation was complete and the devise failed Not only so but it has been held that an executory contract made by the testator subsequent to the execution of his will and after wards rescinded would revoke the devise WXalton v Walton 7 Johns N Y 259 11 Am Dec 456 So again where a man nmade a will devising his lands and then exchanged those lands for others and died if the exchange was vacated subsequent to the testators death this would not revive the devise and the same principal is followed in the matter of equitable interests It would seem therefore that it was for the purpose of meeting this situation that the statute above referred to and that making the will speak as of the death of the testator was passed in the seventh year of William the Fourth and again in the reign of Victoria St 1 Vic c 26 from which our statute was taken This statute was first enacted by our Legislature in 1849 and the report of the revisors referred to the English Statute But for one or two words which do not affect the meaning of the statute ours is almost verbatim the English Statute It is well settled in this state that where a statute is taken from another state or a foreign country and that statute has been construed 644  JanDEVISEREVOCATION BY SALE by the courts of that state or foreign country that the Legisla ture enacting such a statute is presumed to have adopted the con struction placed upon it by the courts of the state or country from which it is taken N  W R R Co v O D Baggage Co 99 Va 111 113 116 N  W R R Co v Cheatwood 103 Va 356 3667 C  O R R Co v Pew 109 Va 288 N  W R R Co v Commonwealth 111 Va 59 68 Mangus v McClel land 93 Va 786 789 This English Statute was construed in the case of Farrar v Earl of Winterton decided in the Rolls Court in 1842 before Lord Longdale Master of the Rolls and reported in 5 Bivans Rep This was the case in which the testator Anna Chapman devised certain freehold estate to parties nameed in the will and by a codicil willed a portion of said real estate to the Earl of Winterton and the remainder to his children The will was dated Dec 17 1834 Subsequently on the 8th lay of January 1839 the testator entered into a written contract to sell certain portions of the real estate to Luke Farrar for the sum of 2250 part cash and with the understanding that upon receiving the balance of the purchase price a conveyance would be exe cuted to the purchaser Before the conveyance was made the testator died and the heirs of Lord Vinterton claimed they were entitled to the money The court however in construing this statute said that while the testator had entered into a contract by which she agreed to sell her whole interest in the estate though she lid not revoke the will in any of the specified ways yet by this act she revoked as effectively as if she had done so in the modes mentioned in the preceding sections of the stat ute that if she had actually conveyel the land there would be no question about the revocation and that since she had con tracted to sell her beneficial interest in equity she had alienated the land and instead of the beneficial interest in the land that she had acquired a title to the purchase money What was really hers in right and equity was inot the land but the money of which alone she had a right to dispose and though she had a lien upon the land and might have refused to convey until the money was paid yet that lien was a mere security in or to which she had no right or interest except for the purpose of enabling 1917  6452 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S her to obtain the payment of the money The beneficial interest in the land which she had devised was not at her disposition but was by her act wholly vested in another at the time of her death It has long been recognized that the proceeds of the sale of real estate previously devised is not real estate but personal prop erty Another phase of the question and incident to the main ques tion of the construction of the statute is what is the nature of a deed of trust Is it merely a lien and security for a debt or has it some quality which would give the beneficiary an interest in the real estate itself Does the holder of the notes for de ferred payments on land secured by deed of trust have any in terest in the land itself This question has been passed upon by the Virginia courts on more than one occasion and the law well settled It is true that commentators and sometimes our own courts speak of the creditor secured by a deed of trust as being a purchaser but he is the purchaser only under the Reg istry Act and in a recent decision namely that of Augusta National Bank v Beard 100 Va 687 Judge Cardwell de livering the opinion of the court on page 691 said A mortgage is but a mere security for the debt and collateral to it And on the same page these authorities without doubt establish the principal that a nortgage is a security and is no part of the land upon which it rests It is true that one who has acquired a direct interest in land by way of a lien or by mort gage or by deed of trust is often referred to by commentators and the courts as a purchaser but this does not mean that a cred itor secured by a deed of trust has an interest that amounts to a right of property in the land A deed of trust creditor or mortgagee has no estate in the land that a judgment would bind And again on the same page quoting from Runkle z Runkle 98 Va 663 in speaking of a creditor secured by a deed of trust says He is simply regarded in the light of a purchaser within the meaning of the Registry law See also Gordon v Rixy 76 Va 694 Penn v Hearon 94 Va 773 Jones on Mortgages  1112 Also in the case of Swann v Young 36 Va 57 the court says 646  JanDEVISEREVOCATION BY SALE The trust creditor has no estate upon condition like the old mortgagees in the time of Littleton He has at no time by virtue of his deed of trust an estate of any kind He has a chose in action made a specific lien by contract and not by change of possession on a certain tract of land and there never comes a time when he or his representatives has more or other than that nor has he at any stage the right to possession unless it is especially given him by the deed a thing rarely done and not done in this case The question of the construction of this statute and also the nature of a deed of trust will be found discussed in the first vol ume of Jarman on Wills Second Edition pp 166180 but es pecially on pp 178180 Other authorities bearing on this subject in one way or the other are the following Emory v Union So ciety of Savannah 79 Me 334 341 30 Am Eng Enc of Law 2 Ed p 654 Vandemark zv Vandemark 26 Barb 416 Am Eng Enc Vol 20 p 902 Chambers v Kearns 59 N C 280 49 Am Dig Cen Ed pp 6034 Additional references to the nature of a deed of trust are Brobst v Brock 10 Wall 519 529 Hale v Horn 21 Gratt 112121 Jones on Mortgages  1112 Hughes v Edwards 9 Wheat U S 484500 The decree of the Circuit Court of Prince Edward County reads as follows It appearing to the court from the evidence in this case that the house and lot on Second Street in the Town of Farmville Va devised by the second clause of the will of Mrs E A Peters to Rosa Elizabeth Blanton was sold by the testatrix in her lifetime to one Mason Bliss and duly conveyed to him taking therefor bonds secured by a deed of trust for the deferred payments the court is of the opin ion that by this act the testatrix fully converted the realty mentioned in said will into personalty which personalty passes to the Administratrix of Mrs E A Peters and that nothing remains to pass as an interest in real estate under the said will to the said Rosa Elizabeth Blanton and con sequently that  2520 of the Code of Virginia can have no application to the case at bar and hence that the sale of the said property in the lifetime of the testatrix was a rev ocation of the devise to Rosa Elizabeth Blanton of the said house and lot the court loth accordingly so adjudge or der and decree The order of the Supreme Court reads as follows 1917  6472 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S VIRGINIA In the Supreme Court of Appeals held at the coulrt

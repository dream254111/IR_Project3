BANKS RELATIONS OF RESERVE BANKS TO MEMBER BANKS AND INTERRELATIONS OF FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS BY R M GIDNEY CONTROLLER AT LARGE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF NEW YORK THE OUTSTANDING CHARACTERISTIC OF THE AMERICAN BANKING SYSTEMA TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF PRACTICALLY IN DEPENDENT BANKS GREAT AND SMALL DOES NOT MAKE FOR CONCERTED UNIFORM OR EFFECTIVE ACTION IN DEALING WITH BANKING CREDIT AND CURRENCY PROBLEMS ON A NATIONWIDE SCALE AND IN A BROAD WAY THE NEED FOR MEANS WHEREBY THESE NUMEROUS INDEPENDENT BANKS COULD COOPERATE FOR MUTUAL PROTECTION AND FOR GREATER SERVICE TO THE COMMERCE INDUSTRY AND AGRICULTURE OF THE COUN TRY HAS LONG BEEN RECOGNIZED BY STUDENTS OF AMERICAN BANKING ORGANI ZATION AND METHODS THE SOLUTION SUGGESTED BY THE EXPERI ENCE OF OTHER COUNTRIES WHICH HAVE HIGHLY DEVELOPED SYSTEMS OF BRANCH BANKING SUPPORTED BY GREAT CENTRAL BANKS HAS NEVER SEEMED ACCEPTABLE TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC THE FORM OF ORGANIZATION ADOPTED TO SUPPLY THE ELEMENTS FORMERLY LACKING IN AMERICAN BANKING WAS NECESSARILY DESIGNED TO DO SO WITHOUT DIMINISHING OR IMPAIRING THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE EXISTING BANK ING INSTITUTIONS THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM WAS CREATED TO ENABLE MEMBER BANKS WHILE OPERATING INDEPENDENTLY AS BEFORE TO MOBILIZE OR UNITE THEIR RESERVE FUNDS AND MAKE THEM MORE AVAILABLE TO MEET DEMANDS FOR INCREASED CREDIT ACCOMMODATION OR GOLD WITH DRAWALS FOR DOMESTIC PURPOSES OR EXPORT THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS WERE TO BE SUPPLEMENTARY TO AN ALREADY EXISTING SYSTEM CONSISTING OF SOME 7500 NA TIONAL BANKS AND OVER 19000 STATE INSTITUTIONS A VERY CONSIDERABLE PRO PORTION OF THESE INSTITUTIONS BEING EXPECTED TO TAKE MEMBERSHIP AND THUS GIVE TO THE SYSTEM THE SUPPORT NECES SARY TO MAKE IT A GOING CONCERN CAPABLE OF AFFORDING TO ITS MEMBERS THE FACILITIES AND ADVANTAGES WHICH IT WAS EXPECTED TO CREATE THE PROVISION FOR COMPUL SORY MEMBERSHIP OF OVER 7500 NA TIONAL BANKS THEN IN EXISTENCE GIVE ASSURANCE OF AMPLE SUPPORT AT THE OUT SET THE PURPOSE THEN OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM WAS TO MAKE POSSIBLE THE ASSOCIATION OF THE BANKS OF THE COUNTRY IN ORDER TO SUPPLY THE ELEMENTS OF MUTUAL PROTECTION SERVICE AND FACILITIES WHICH OUR SYSTEM OF INDEPEN DENT BANKS HAD LACKED AND IN ITS ESSENTIAL FEATURES IT MAY BRIEFLY AND ACCURATELY BE DESCRIBED AS A GREAT COIPERATIVE BANKING ASSOCIATION IT INCLUDES AT THIS TIME ABOUT 8200 NATIONAL BANKS AND 1625 STATE BANKS AND TRUST COMPANIES THE LATTER HAVE BECOME MEMBERS VOLUNTARILY UNDER THE PERMISSIVE PROVISION OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE ACT RESERVE BANKS ARE PRIVATE COR PORATIONS THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING THE CREATION OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM AND THE DISTINCTLY GOVERNMENTAL CHAR ACTER OF THE PROCEDURE WHICH BROUGHT IT INTO EXISTENCE HAVE TENDED TO CREATE THE IMPRESSION THAT THE FEDERAL RE SERVE SYSTEM IS A PURELY GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY AN IMPRESSION STRENGTHENED BY THE HIGHLY IMPORTANT WORK DONE BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS ACTING AS FISCAL AGENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT IN SELLING AND HANDLING GOVERNMENT SECURITIES DURING 87THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY AND SINCE THE WAR THE FACT IS HOW EVER THAT THE TWELVE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS ARE PRIVATE CORPORATIONS ORGAN IZED UNDER AN ACT OF CONGRESS THEIR ONLY STOCKHOLDERS BEING THE MEMBER BANKS WHOSE STOCK SUBSCRIPTION IS PRO PORTIONATE TO THEIR CAPITAL AND SURPLUS THEIR OPERATIONS ARE DIRECTED BY TWELVE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS TWOTHIRDS OF THE MEMBERS OF EACH BOARD ARE ELECTED BY THE MEMBER BANKS AND ONETHIRD ARE APPOINTED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD EACH FEDERAL RESERVE BANK IS THUS OPERATED UNDER THE CONTROL OF A BOARD OF DIRECTORS INCLUDING THREE GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES MOST OF WHOM ARE BUSINESS MEN THREE BANKERS AND THREE MEN ENGAGED IN COMMERCE INDUSTRY OR AGRICULTURE BUT NOT CON NECTED AS OFFICER OR DIRECTOR WITH ANY BANK THE DIRECTORATES OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS INCLUDE NOT ONLY BANK ERS BUT ALSO MEN EXPERIENCED AND SUCCESSFUL IN VARIOUS LINES OF BUSINESS INDUSTRY OR AGRICULTURE THIS FEATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS AND THEIR MEMBERS IS WORTHY OF EMPHASIS IT SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE MEMBER BANKS THROUGH THEIR RIGHT TO TWOTHIRDS OF THE DIRECTORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS ARE IN CONTROL OF THE ACTUAL OPERATIONS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD RELATIONS BETWEEN FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS AND THEIR MEMBERS HAVE GROWN TO BE VERY MUCH LIKE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE LARGER BANKS OF THE COUNTRY AND THEIR OUTOFTOWN CORRESPONDENTS THE MEMBER BANK STOCKHOLDERS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS USE THESE BANKS AS DEPOSITARIES FOR THEIR LEGAL RESERVES IN AMOUNTS DETERMINED BY LAW THUS BRINGING ABOUT THE MOBILIZATION OF BANKING RESERVES CONTEMPLATED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE ACT AND FURNISH ING THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS WITH THE FUNDS WHICH ARE THE BASIS FOR THEIR OPERATIONS THESE RELATIONS CONSTITUTE THE MINIMUM WHICH MAY EXIST BETWEEN THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS AND THEIR MEMBERS FOR SOME TIME AFTER THE ORGANIZATION OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS A VERY LARGE PROPORTION OF THE MEMBER BANKS DID NOT TRANSACT ANY BUSINESS THROUGH THEM AND RELATIONS WERE ONLY OF THE BARE MINIMUM ABOVE DESCRIBED THE RELATIONSHIP NOW EXISTING BETWEEN THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS AND THEIR MEMBERS IS THE RESULT OF EVOLUTION AND IS FAR CLOSER THAN IN THE EARLIER DAYS OF THE SYSTEM THE ATTITUDE OF THE NA TIONAL BANK OFFICERS WHOSE INSTITUTIONS WERE PRACTICALLY DRAFTED INTO THE FED ERAL RESERVE SYSTEM AT THE TIME OF ITS ESTABLISHMENT WAS THEN NOT ALTOGETHER FRIENDLY AND MANY OF THEM WERE STRONGLY ANTAGONISTIC TO THE NEW SYS TEM AND OPENLY EXPRESSED THEIR INTEN TION TO HAVE AS LITTLE TO DO WITH IT AS POSSIBLE THESE BANKERS HAD A NATURAL RELUCTANCE TO BREAK OR IMPAIR LONG ESTABLISHED TIES AND FELT THAT THE RESERVE BANKS WOULD BE IN A SENSE GOVERNMENT BUREAUS AND WOULD ADOPT METHODS INVOLVING RED TAPE AND AFFORD ING LITTLE OPPORTUNITY FOR CLOSE AND SYMPATHETIC PERSONAL RELATIONS MANY BELIEVED THAT MEMBER BANKS ESPECIALLY THOSE IN THE SMALLER PLACES WOULD HAVE LITTLE PAPER OF A CHARACTER ELIGIBLE FOR REDISCOUNT AND THAT AS THEY WOULD BE OBLIGED TO CONTINUE TO CARRY RESERVES WITH THEIR CORRESPONDENTS MEMBERSHIP IN THE SYSTEM WOULD BE MORE OF A BUR DEN THAN A PRIVILEGE THOSE ENTRUSTED WITH THE MANAGE MENT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM APPRECIATING AND UNDERSTANDING THE ATTITUDE OF THE MEMBER BANKS REALIZED THAT UPON THEM DEVOLVED THE DUTY OF SO CONDUCTING THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS AS TO DISARM CRITICISM AND TO MAKE THE SERVICE OF THE RESERVE BANKS TO THEIR MEMBERS SO SATISFACTORY AND CONVENIENT THAT THOSE WHO HAD ANTICI 88RELATIONS OF RESERVE BANKS PATED UNPLEASANT RELATIONS WOULD BE OBLIGED TO REVISE THEIR OPINIONS NOT WITHSTANDING THIS FORWARDLOOKING AT TITUDE ON THE PART OF THE MANAGERS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM PROGRESS TOWARD CLOSER RELATIONS WITH MEMBER BANKS WAS SLOW AND DID NOT BECOME REALLY APPRECIABLE UNTIL THE PRESSURE OF PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH WAR FINANCING IN 1917 BROUGHT ABOUT A FULLER UTILIZA TION BY MEMBER BANKS OF THE FACILITIES OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM AND CONSEQUENTLY A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF ITS POSSIBILITIES FOR SERVICE WAR LOANS A CEMENTING FACTOR TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS WAS GIVEN THE GREAT TASK OF ORGANIZING IN THEIR RESPECTIVE DISTRICTS DISTRIBUTING AGENCIES FOR THE HUGE LOANS WHICH THE GOVERNMENT FOUND IT NECESSARY TO FLOAT AND FOR THIS UNDERTAKING THE AID AND SUPPORT OF BANKERS BOTH MEMBER AND NONMEMBER WAS SOUGHT AND OBTAINED THE SPLENDID EFFORTS OF THOSE ASSOCIATED IN THIS WORK MAY BE INFERRED FROM RE SULTS THE CLOSE RELATIONSHIP THUS DE VELOPED AND THE SPLENDID COOPERATION OF THE BANKERS WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS IN PLACING THE GOVERNMENTS LOANS MADE FOR UNDERSTANDING AND MUTUAL APPRECIATION BETWEEN THE RE SERVE BANKS AND THEIR MEMBERS TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT LONG BEFORE THE WORK OF GOVERNMENT FINANCING HAD CEASED TO REQUIRE THE MOST ACTIVE EFFORTS OF THOSE ENGAGED IN IT THE ATTITUDE OF THE MEMBER BANKS HAD CHANGED FROM PASSIVE TOLERATION OR OUTSPOKEN ANTAG ONISM TO AN ATTITUDE ON THE PART OF THE MAJORITY OF THE MEMBER BANKS DISTINCTLY FRIENDLY TO THE FEDERAL RE SERVE SYSTEM WITH WARTIME ACTIVITY CAME DE MAND FOR CREDIT EXPANSION WHICH BROUGHT INTO PLAY THE LOANING FUNCTION OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS MEM BER BANKS WHICH HAD BEEN SKEPTICAL OF THE VALUE OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM AND HAD DOUBTED THE NECESSITY FOR ITS EXISTENCE FOUND THEMSELVES OBLIGED TO BORROW IF THEY WERE TO DO THEIR PART IN WAR FINANCE AND FOR THE FIRST TIME A CONVINCING ILLUSTRATION OF THE VALUE OF THE LOANING ACTIVITIES OF THE RESERVE BANKS WAS GIVEN MEMBER BANKS SOON FOUND THAT BORROWING AT RESERVE BANKS DID NOT INVOLVE UNNECESSARY FORMALITY OR RED TAPE AS THE LOAN POLICIES OF THE RESERVE BANKS HAVE IN GENERAL BEEN ALONG VERY LIBERAL LINES LOAN APPLICA TIONS HAVE UNIFORMLY BEEN ACTED UPON PROMPTLY ON DAY OF RECEIPT SO THAT A MEMBER BANK SENDING IN PAPER FOR REDISCOUNT CAN COUNT UPON RECEIVING CREDIT FOR THE PROCEEDS THEREOF AS PROMPTLY AS IF IT WERE A REMITTANCE OF BANK DRAFTS PROMPTNESS LIBERALITY OF TREATMENT AND WILLINGNESS TO MEET ALL PROPER DEMANDS WHICH CHARACTERIZED THE LOAN ACTIVITIES OF THE RESERVE BANKS WERE MOST POTENT FACTORS IN BRINGING ABOUT A BETTER UNDERSTANDING WITH THEIR MEMBERS QUICK MEETING OF CURRENCY NEEDS AT THE SAME TIME THE ABILITY OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS THROUGH THEIR POWER OF NOTE ISSUE TO SUPPLY THE RAPID LY EXPANDING CURRENCY NEEDS OF THE COUNTRY LED TO FREE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS FUNCTION THE PROCESS BY WHICH FED ERAL RESERVE NOTES ARE ISSUED AND RE DEEMED IS PERHAPS WORTHY OF A BRIEF DESCRIPTION HERE A MEMBER BANK DESIRING CURRENCY OR COIN REQUESTS THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK TO CHARGE ITS ACCOUNT AND IF IT FINDS ITSELF WITH MORE CURRENCY THAN IT DESIRES TO RETAIN IN VAULT OR HAS CURRENCY WHICH IS NO LONGER FIT FOR USE IT FORWARDS THE SUR PLUS TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK FOR CREDIT THE RESERVE BANKS PAY THE COST OF SHIPPING CURRENCY OR COIN BOTH WAYS THUS FACILITATING THE PROMPT REDEMPTION OF CURRENCY WHICH IS IN EXCESS OF THE IMMEDIATE NEEDS OF THE COUNTRY AND ENABLING MEMBER BANKS 89THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY TO OPERATE WITH A MINIMUM OF VAULT RESERVE THE PAYMENT OF COST OF SHIP MENT OF CURRENCY TO THE MEMBER BANKS WAS DEVELOPED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS IN AN EFFORT TO GIVE MEMBER INSTITUTIONS OUTSIDE OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE CITIES AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE SIMI LAR SERVICE TO THAT GIVEN BANKS IN THE FEDERAL RESERVE CITIES A SIMILAR POL ICY FOR SHIPMENTS OF CURRENCY RECEIVED FROM MEMBER BANKS WAS ADOPTED AS AN INCIDENT TO PAR CHECK COLLECTION WITH THE OBJECT OF ELIMINATING ANY ELEMENT OF COST TO A MEMBER BANK IN REMITTING FOR CHECKS SENT IT FOR COLLECTION BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK CHECK COLLECTION PLAN PROGRESSED SLOWLY THE FEDERAL RESERVE CHECK COLLEC TION ON THE OTHER HAND WAS LONG AN OBSTACLE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF CLOSE RELATIONS WITH MEMBER BANKS BECAUSE OF THE OPPOSITION OF MANY OF THE BANKS IN SMALLER PLACES TO THE CHANGE IN PRACTICE WHICH THIS SYSTEM INVOLVED THE COLLECTION OF CHECKS THROUGH THE RESERVE BANKS HAS HOWEVER MADE TREMENDOUS GROWTH AND EACH FEDERAL RESERVE BANK NOW SENDS DAILY LETTERS CONTAINING CHECKS FOR COLLECTION TO PRACTICALLY ALL OF THE BANKS OF ITS DIS TRICT BOTH MEMBER AND NONMEMBER SIMILAR CONTACT RESULTS FROM THE COL LECTION OF NOTES DRAFTS BILLS OF EX CHANGE COUPONS MATURING BONDS ETC WHICH IS UNDERTAKEN BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS OTHER IMPORTANT FACILITIES ARE TRANS FERRING FUNDS BY WIRE BETWEEN VARIOUS SECTIONS OF THE COUNTRY WITHOUT CHARGE TO THE MEMBER BANK AND THE SAFEKEEP ING OF SECURITIESTHE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF NEW YORK ALONE NOW HOLDING IN THIS MANNER FOR ITS MEMBERS 1239 215899 OF BONDS AND OTHER SECURITIES IN ALL THE TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS AND THEIR MEMBERS THE ATTITUDE OF THE RESERVE BANKS IS LIKE THAT OF ANY OTHER BANK DEALING WITH CORRESPONDENTS AND MAT TERS ARE HANDLED ALONG BANKING LINES A FACT WHICH HAS HAD MUCH TO DO WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CLOSE RELATIONS WHICH NOW EXIST BETWEEN RESERVE BANKS AND THEIR MEMBERS BETTER BANKING METHODS AN IMPORTANT INFLUENCE HAS BEEN EXERTED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS MAKING FOR IMPROVEMENT OF BANKING METHODS ON THE PART OF MEMBER BANKS THE PRACTICE OF OBTAINING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM BORROWERS HAS BECOME MUCH MORE GENERAL BECAUSE THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE MEMBER BANK MAY LATER DESIRE TO REDISCOUNT THE PAPER WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK AND ALSO BECAUSE THE REQUIREMENT OF BOR ROWERS STATEMENTS FOR NOTES OF 5000 OR OVER BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS HAS HAD THE EFFECT OF STANDARDIZING THIS PRACTICE AND LEADING TO ITS ADOPTION BY BANKS WHICH HAD FORMERLY NOT CONSID ERED IT FEASIBLE MEMBERSHIP IN THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM HAS MADE FOR IMPORTANT CHANGES IN THE CHARACTER OF BANK INVESTMENTS MAINLY IN THE DIREC TION OF GREATER LIQUIDITY BANKS WHICH HAD FORMERLY CARRIED BONDS OR CALL LOANS ON STOCK EXCHANGE COLLATERAL AS THEIR SO CALLED SECONDARY RESERVE HAVE ADOPTED THE SOUND PRACTICE OF DIVERSIFYING THEIR INVESTMENTS BY ADDING TO THEIR PORTFOLIOS COMMERCIAL PAPER PURCHASED IN THE OPEN MARKET AND SUCH HIGHLY LIQUID ELEMENTS AS BANKERS ACCEPTANCES AND UNITED STATES CERTIFICATES OF INDEBT EDNESS THUS THEY HAVE PLACED THEM SELVES IN MUCH STRONGER POSITION AS TO AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS TO MEET WITH DRAWALS BY CARRYING ADEQUATE AMOUNTS OF PAPER AVAILABLE FOR REDISCOUNT OR SALE AND ALSO AT LEAST A MODERATE AMOUNT OF PAPER OF SHORT MATURITY THIS IM PROVEMENT IN THE DISTRIBUTION AND LIQUIDITY OF MEMBER BANKS INVESTMENT HOLDINGS HAS ENABLED THEM WITH SAFETY 90RELATIONS OF RESERVE BANKS TO INVEST THEIR FUNDS MORE CLOSELY THAN EVER BEFORE WITH RESULTING INCREASE IN PROFIT IN THE IMPORTANT MATTER OF CHECK COLLECTIONS ALSO THE PRACTICE OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS OF DEFERRING CREDIT ON OUTOFTOWN CHECKS A SUFFI CIENT TIME TO PERMIT OF THEIR ACTUAL COL LECTION HAS LED TO REALIZATION OF THE IM PORTANCE OF PROMPTNESS IN THE HANDLING OF OUTOFTOWN CHECKS AND CLOSER ANALY SIS THAN FORMERLY OF ACCOUNTS INVOLVING THE ELEMENT OF COLLECTION TIME THE DIRECT ACTIVITIES OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS IN COLLECTING CHECKS FOR THEIR MEMBERS HAS REDUCED VERY MATERIALLY AND PERHAPS CUT IN HALF THE TIME RE QUIRED TO COLLECT OUTOFTOWN CHECKS AND ENCOURAGEMENT HAS ALSO BEEN GIVEN TO MEMBER BANKS TO FORM COUNTY CLEAR ING HOUSES SO THAT BANKS IN NEIGHBORING TOWNS MAY EXCHANGE WITH EACH OTHER AND STILL FURTHER REDUCE THE TIME RE QUIRED FOR COLLECTION OF SUCH CHECKS BANKS NEED LESS CASH IN VAULT MORE ECONOMICAL METHODS AS TO THE HOLDING OF VAULT CASH BY MEMBER BANKS HAVE BEEN MADE POSSIBLE BY IMPROVED FACILITIES FOR OBTAINING CURRENCY AND COIN AND BY LEGISLATION ENACTED IN 1917 RELIEVING MEMBER BANKS FROM THE FORMER REQUIREMENT FOR A FIXED AMOUNT OF CASH IN VAULT IN OCTOBER 1914 THE 7571 NATIONAL BANKS OF THE COUNTRY HELD CASH IN VAULT EQUAL TO 164 PER CENT OF THEIR DEPOSITS ON JUNE 30 1921 9745 MEMBER BANKS HELD VAULT CASH EQUAL TO ONLY 26 PER CENT OF THEIR DEPOSITS THE INFLUENCE OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS MAKING FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THE TECHNICAL FEATURES OF BANK OPERATION THOUGH NOT READILY MEASURED HAS BEEN OF FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE AND IS AMONG THE MOST BENEFICIAL RESULTS OF THE SYSTEMS OPERATIONS ESPECIALLY WHEN CONSIDERED WITH FULL REALIZATION OF THE IM PORTANCE IN MODERN ECONOMIC ORGANIZA TION OF A BANKING MACHINERY ADAPTED TO THE GREAT TASKS WHICH DEVOLVE UPON IT FOR OBVIOUS REASONS NO PUBLICITY HAS BEEN GIVEN TO A HIGHLY IMPORTANT RE SERVE BANK ACTIVITY THE ASSISTANCE OF MEMBER BANKS WHICH FOR ANY REASON FIND THEMSELVES IN A DANGEROUS POSITION AND THE CONFIDENTIAL CHARACTER OF THIS RELATIONSHIP PRECLUDES OTHER THAN A VERY GENERAL STATEMENT CONCERNING IT IN A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF INSTANCES THE RESERVE BANKS HAVE NOT ONLY EXTENDED ASSISTANCE IN THE WAY OF LOANS BUT HAVE ALSO LOANED MEMBERS OF THE RESERVE BANK STAFF TO ASSIST THE INSTITUTIONS THROUGH THEIR DIFFICULTIES WITH THE RESULT IN A NUMBER OF INSTANCES THAT INSTITUTIONS WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN FORCED TO SUCCUMB HAVE BEEN REHABILITATED AND ARE NOW IN SUCCESSFUL OPERATION CLOSE RELATIONS WITH MEMBER BANKS HAVE ALSO BEEN ASSISTED IN SOME DIS TRICTS BY CONFERENCES OF MEMBER BANKERS WITH FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OFFICERS AT WHICH THE OPERATIONS AND FUNCTIONS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS WERE CLEARLY AND FULLY EXPLAINED AND ALSO BY VISITS TO MEMBER BANKS AT THEIR HOME OFFICES MADE BY RESERVE BANK REPRESENTATIVES THE OFFICERS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS REALIZE AN OBLIGATION TO EXTEND A SERVICE OF HIGH ORDER TO MEMBER BANKS AND TO PROMOTE COOPERATION ALONG BANKING LINES RATHER THAN TO TAKE AN ATTITUDE WHICH MIGHT LEAD MEMBER BANKS TO FEEL THAT THEY WERE DEALING WITH A DISTANT AND IMPERSONAL ORGANIZA TION OPERATED AS A GOVERNMENT AGENCY IN OTHER WORDS THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO FUNCTION AS BANKS AND TO CONDUCT THEIR RELATIONS WITH MEMBER BANKS ALONG MUCH THE SAME LINES AS THOSE BY WHICH THE LARGER BANKING INSTITUTIONS OF THE COUNTRY HAVE IN THE PAST SO SUCCESSFULLY CONDUCTED THEIR RELATIONS WITH OUTOFTOWN CORRES PONDENTS THE HIGHLY SATISFACTORY RE SULTS OF THIS POLICY ARE TO BE FOUND IN 91THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY THE FRIENDLY ATTITUDE WHICH IS NOW MANI FEST ON THE PART OF MEMBER BANKS TOWARD THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS INTERRELATIONS OF RESERVE BANKS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF TWELVE REGIONAL FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS RATHER THAN OF A CENTRAL BANK WAS IN KEEPING WITH THE GREAT AREA OF OUR COUNTRY WHICH MIGHT BE CONSIDERED AS MAKING THE ESTABLISH MENT OF ONE GREAT CENTRAL BANK OF DOUBTFUL ADVANTAGE AND WITH THE AMERICAN PREDILECTION FOR THE MINIMUM OF BANKING CENTRALIZATION THE TWELVE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS WERE TO BE AND ARE OPERATED EACH BY ITS OWN BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND EACH IS TO A VERY LARGE DEGREE AN INDEPENDENT ENTITY HAVING POWER TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS ARISING WITHIN ITS OWN DISTRICT ACCORDING TO THE JUDGMENT OF ITS DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS THIS HAS GIVEN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF INDIVIDUALITY IN PERSONNEL AND METHODS AND FOR THE CONTROL OF EACH FEDERAL RESERVE BANK BY MEN FAMILIAR WITH THE BUSINESS OF THE DISTRICT COUNTERACTING TO A CONSIDERABLE DE GREE THIS TENDENCY TO INDIVIDUALITY IN THE MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONS OF THE SEVERAL FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS IS THE INFLUENCE OF COMMON FUNCTION AND PUR POSE OF INTERBANK CONTACT AND ALSO THE SUPERVISION OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD THE PRACTICALLY IDENTICAL RELA TIONSHIP OF EACH RESERVE BANK TO ITS MEMBERS AND THE SIMILARITY OF FUNC TIONS LED EARLY TO EFFORTS TO CO6RDINATE ACTION ON ALL MATTERS POSSIBLE OF COM MON SOLUTION EVEN BEFORE THE ORGANI ZATION OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS THE PRELIMINARY ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE HAD PREPARED PLANS FOR ACCOUNTING AND METHODS WHICH WERE TO A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT USED BY THE RESERVE BANKS WHEN ORGANIZED THOUGH MODIFIED IN MANY WAYS AS EXPERIENCE SHOWED NEED FOR CHANGE A CONFERENCE OF GOVERNORS AND DIREC TORS OF ALL FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS PRE CEDED THE ACTUAL OPENING OF THE BANKS PROBLEMS OF GENERAL POLICY BEFORE THE BANKS AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD HAVE BEEN THE SUBJECT OF DISCUSSION AT CONFERENCES HELD FROM TIME TO TIME BY GOVERNORS AND FEDERAL RESERVE AGENTS NUMEROUS CONFERENCES HAVE ALSO BEEN HELD BY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE RESERVE BANKS TO DEAL WITH THE MORE TECHNICAL FEATURES OF OPERATION SUCH AS ACCOUNT ING AND AUDITING METHODS CHECK COL LECTIONS EMPLOYMENT METHODS AND OTHER SIMILAR PROBLEMS THE SPIRIT OF COOPERATION AND WILLINGNESS TO TAKE COUNSEL TOGETHER EVIDENCED AT THESE CONFERENCES HAS BEEN TYPICAL OF THE EVERYDAY RELATIONS BETWEEN THE RESERVE BANKS AND HAS RESULTED IN THE DEVELOP MENT OF A CLOSEKNIT SYSTEM IN WHICH THE SEVERAL UNITS THOUGH INDEPENDENT IN MANAGEMENT WORK TOGETHER TO OB TAIN FOR THEIR MEMBERS AND THE PUBLIC THE ADVANTAGES TO BE DERIVED FROM A UNIFIED BANKING SYSTEM THE RESULTS OF COOPERATION AMONG THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS ARE IN SOME CASES VERY TANGIBLE AS NOTABLY THE COUNTRYWIDE CHECK COLLECTION SYSTEM THE ESTABLISHMENT OF FACILITIES FOR TRANS FERS OF FUNDS OVER THE PRIVATE WIRES BETWEEN FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS THE ES TABLISHMENT OF A GOLD SETTLEMENT FUND THROUGH WHICH HAS BEEN OBVIATED THE NECESSITY OF GOLD SHIPMENTS BETWEEN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL THE FACIL ITIES FOR INTERBANK REDISCOUNTS BY MEANS OF WHICH SEASONAL LOAN DEMANDS MAY BE MET BY THE RESERVE BANKS WHOSE POSITIONS ARE RELATIVELY STRONG AND WHO LOAN TO THOSE ON WHICH THE PRESSURE IS GREATEST

RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COURSE WHICH HAS BEEN TAKEN IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SYSTEM PRO VIDED FOR IN GENERAL OUTLINE BY THE WHICH THE RESERVE BANKS OPERATE AND ALSO TO BRING ABOUT GENERAL UNIFORMITY IN

THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM MAY BE SAID TO GIVE THE ADVANTAGES OF THE MOBILIZATION AND CENTRALIZATION OF BANKING RESERVES WHILE PRESERVING THE TYPICALLY AMERICAN FREEDOM FROM HIGHLY CENTRALIZED CONTROL THE EVOLUTION AND PRACTICAL OPERATION OF THE GOLD SETTLEMENT FUND BY GEORGE J SEAY GOVERNOR OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF RICHMOND IT IS DIFFICULT TO REALIZE THAT ONLY SEVEN YEARS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS DURING THAT PERIOD MATTERS OF SUCH TREMENDOUS IMPORT TO THE WORLD HAVE HAPPENED AND DEVELOP MENTS IN BANKING AND FINANCE HAVE BEEN SO REVOLUTIONARY IN THEIR NATURE AND SIZE THAT WE HAVE A FULL UNDER STANDING OF THE FEELINGS OF THE SMALL BOY OF SEVEN WHO DECLARED THAT ALTHOUGH ONLY SEVEN JUDGING BY THE EXPERIENCE HE HAD HAD HE WAS MOST A HUNDRED SINCE 1914 THE RESOURCES OF THE BANKS OF THE UNITED STATES HAVE GROWN FROM 27 BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO 53 BILLIONS AND BANK CLEARINGS HAVE GROWN FROM 155 BILLIONS TO 451 BILLIONS IN MEASURING THE NATIONAL DEBT THE INCOME OF THE TREASURY AND TAXATION THE UNIT IS NO LONGER A MILLION BUT A BILLION ALL THE MOMENTOUS AND TRAGIC EX PERIENCES OF LIFE LEAVE AN IMPRESSION UPON THE MIND OF HAVING OCCUPIED A PROLONGED PERIOD THEREFORE IT SEEMS THAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM HAS BEEN OPERATING FOR A PERIOD MUCH LONGER THAN THAT MEASURED BY SEVEN CALENDAR YEARS AS A MATTER OF FACT IT HAS BEYOND DOUBT DEVELOPED IN THOSE SEVEN YEARS AT A PACE FAR MORE RAPID THAN COULD HAVE BEEN EXPECTED IN NORMAL TIMES THE COUNTRY SEEMS ACCUSTOMED AND SEASONED TO THE OPERA TIONS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM BUT IT BECOMES APPARENT FROM TIME TO TIME THAT MANY PEOPLE AND EVEN MANY BANKS HAVE NOT A FULL APPRECIATION OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE SYSTEM OR A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACT THAT FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE MAGNITUDE DEVELOPED WITHIN THESE SEVEN YEARS WERE RENDERED POSSIBLE ONLY BY THE OPERATION OF THE SYSTEM THE COUNTRY BANKER WHEN HE SENDS HIS CHECKS AND COLLECTION ITEMS TO HIS CITY CORRESPONDENT MAY THINK THAT THEREBY HE IS CREATING EXCHANGE THIS IS BUT THE FIRST AND THE LOWEST STEP IN THE CREATION OF EXCHANGE THE PROC ESSES INVOLVED IN THE COLLECTION AND FINAL SETTLEMENT OF SUCH ITEMS ARE NUMEROUS AND THEY CONSTITUTE THE FABRIC OF EXCHANGE THE FEDERAL RE SERVE SYSTEM HAS DEVELOPED THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE AND MOST EFFECTIVE SYS TEM OF EXCHANGE KNOWN TO THE BANKING WORLD

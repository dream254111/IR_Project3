a letter which we publish today Pro fessor Ray iLankester who is this year presi dent of the British Association tells the story of the summary termination of his director ship of the Natural History Museum some imperfect versions of which have obtained currency The standing committee of the trustees have taken advantage of the civil service rule that the head of a department mnay call upon any officer in it to retire at the age of sixty upon such pension as he is en titled to by the general regulations That rule is not usually acted upon in the absence of some special reason unless the officer has completed such a term of service as entitles him to the maximuin pension Dr Lankester was appointed at the age of fiftytwo so that when he reaches sixty next May a regulation intended to apply to men who have spent their lives in a government office decrees that his pension shall be 160 which the treasury of its goodness may raise to 300 In any coun try but this it wofuld be thought grotesque and monstrous that a distinguished man of science asked to serve the state after the age From the London TimesAUGUTT 24 1906 SCIENCE 251 Qf fifty with his abilities fully tested and his scientific reputation fully established should be treated on the same footing as a clerk who might never have done anything but copy documents and perhaps post a ledger In this country there used to be a way of mitiga ting the absurdity of the system The treasury could in such cases add twentyone years to the service for pension purposes thereby en abling a man joining late in life on some special ground to be put in a position not much worse than that of an undistinguished copyist joining early But in recent years the treasury has curtailed its own powers and can not now add more than seven years Were another Newton today made master of the mint and were he to be dismissed or to be come incapable of performing his duties five years afterwards he would receive at the most a pension calculated on twelve years service That is how this nation enlists knowledge and ability for the carrying on of its affairs But that is not by any means the worst it can do A man may serve it like Lord Milner for a long term of years in diffi cult and arduous positions but if he is not technically in the civil service he may be dis missed into private life at an age when other remunerative employment is unattainable without any compensation at all No explanation has been vouchsafed to Dr Lankester for the cavalier treatment he has received His eminence in his own scientific field is unquestionable and has been abun dantly recognized by those most competent to judge both abroad and at home Nor is he one of the unpractical students who do not know how to handle business On the con trary he has all the qualities required in an efficient administrator We are thrown back therefore upon reasons of a more personal kind He was appointed by the three prin cipal trustees in whom power of appointment and dismissal is vested by statute But the appointment was resented by some active members of the standing committee which has taken the first opportunity to reverse it It may be presumed that he has not succeeded in conciliating those who were opposed to his appointment and as he holds his own views rather strongly and is not too patient with what presents itself to him as stupidity it is even possible that he has not tried very hard to conciliate them In most situations in life it is necessary to reckon with these personal factors which indeed may be raised to the dignity of impersonal factors in circumstances where harmonious cooperation among many becomes as important as the most commanding ability in one man If the difficulty in the present case is of this order it may now be regarded as insuperable Dr Lankester him self would probably recognize that whatever the causes his usefulness at the museum and his own comfort in remaining there are alike at an end But though this may be a good reason for the severance of his connection with the museum it is no reason at all for turning him adrift at the age of sixty with a derisory compensation calculated upon rules intended for a totally different purpose If he does not get on with the other pepple in the museum probably there are faults on both sides and too much zeal for science may have been one of his In any case failure to get on with somebody else is not by a very long way mis conduict of the kind that forfeits a position He gave up a secure position at Oxford to take the directorship trusting to a general but not wellfounded impression that the state may be relied upon to treat its servants with generosity There are not many things open to a man of sixty and there are few suitable to the student of biology The museum may manage its affairs in its own way but it is a disgrace to the nation to treat a distinguished man of science entering its service in excep tional circumstances as if he were an ordinary clerk merely because an absurd technicality places both in the same category

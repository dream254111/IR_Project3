Esq MA FRS Professor of Chemistry and Mineralogy in the University of Durham Received May 9Read June 20 1839 III The Resin of Gamboge or Gummi Gutt THE medical and commercial values of the several varieties of garnboge which occur as articles of commerce in the European markets and their botanical origin have lately been investigated by Dr CHRISTISON He found the different varieties to contain

soluble in alcohol and largely in ether and so far as ex periments go may be obtained by either solvent free fiom the foreign substances with which it is mixed in the resin of commerce Like many of the other resins acid as well as basic it retains with considerable obstinacy the last traces of these sol vents and requires the prolonged action of a temperature above that of complete fusion fully to expel them 1 532 grains of the resin precipitated by water from its solution in alcohol dried and fused at 212 FAHR gave C  1398 and H  352 grains 2 6685 grains of the same gave C  1764 and HI  443 grains 3 7675 grains of the resin obtained by evaporating the ethereal solution and pro longed heating gave C  20060 and H  504 grains 4 8235 grains of the same heated to 350 FAHR gave C  21 640 and H  5365 grains 5 To be certain that alcohol and ether were absent the resin was dissolved in caustic potash precipitated by muriatic acid washed dried and fused at 3500 FAHR In this state it fused less readily and was of a darker colour 13146 grains gave C  34432 and H  867 grains  Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh March 7 1836 2 o 2MR JOHNSTON ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RESINS These

results of analysis approach exceedingly near to the beautifully simple for mula C5 H3 0 or C40 H24 0 which gives Calculated Experiment C5  382185  73550 72763 H3  37438  7205 7363 10  100000  19245 19874 519623 100 100 This formula is further interesting because of the close relation it would establish between oil of turpentine and its resin and that of gamboge since Oil of turpentine C5 H4   C IH 0 The fact however that in all the analyses there is a constant deficiency of carbon to the amount of nearly one per cent renders the formula suspicious It is true that the gambodic acid has a strong affinity or attraction for ether and alcohol and that a certain quantity of these substances may have been present in some of the speci mens analysed yet it would be necessary to suppose a much larger admixture of them than seems possible in order to account for so great a diminution in the per centage of carbon Neither can we admit the presence of these substances in the resin after solution in potash though the carbon in this also is considerably less than the formula requires In order to determine whether a still higher temperature than 350 FAHR would drive off a further portion of alcohol from the resin precipitated from its solution by water I heated it to 400  FAHR when it ceased to emit its agreeable fragrant odourt gave off white vapours and became slightly darker in colour In this state 1138 grains gave C  3023 H  673 grains or per cent Carbon  73791 Hydrogen  6 601 Oxygen  21608 100 282MR JOHNSTON ON E COSTITT THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RESINS The carbon here is sufficiently great but there is much too little hydrogen for the formula C5 IH3 O to which this resin seems so closely to approximate After fusion at this temperature however the gambodic acid was no longer wholly soluble in alcohol nearly one half of its bulk being left behind in the form of a yellow powder when digested in this liquid This powder was collected washed with al cohol and heated for a long time at 212  FAHR previous to analysis At 400 FAHR it undergoes no apparent change at 500 FAHR it becomes brown and gradually darkens but does not mnelt 730 grains gave C  1893 and

calculated The formula which mnost nearly represents the result of experiments on the un changed resin is C48 H29 010 This gives per cent C48  3668976  72929 H29  361908  7193 10  1000000  19878 5030884 100000 in which there is an allowance for loss of carbon and for a similar slight excess of hydrogen in the results of analysis being the directions in which errors are likely to occur It is satisfactorily ascertained however that the gamboge of commerce as we have found reason to conclude is the case with dragons blood undergoes a process of ma nufacture before it is brought to market Like the reed dragons blood it has all the appearance of having been fused and moulded into shapes the effect of such fusion in the case of the red resin is as we have seen to diminish the amount of carbon about one per cent and if we suppose a similar change produced on the gamboge the deficiency of carbon in the analysis will be sufficiently accounted for The likelihood of an analogous change in the two resins is the greater as they belong apparently to a kindred group the several members of which are related almost as closely as mastic and colophony On comparing the quantity of hydrogen found by analysis with that given by the formula C40 H24 O 7205 per cent we find them approach so closely as scarcely to allow for the necessary errors of experiment but in the reed dragons blood there was a similar deficiency so that until we have the opportunity of analysing the gamboge resin as it issues from the tree we might adopt the formula to which the results appear to point There is an analogy however in favour of the formula  See page 134 of the present volume 283MR JOHNSTON ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RESINS C40 H23 O containing one equivalent less of hydrogen which is not unworthy of attention When heated above 400 FAHR we have seen that this resin is partly changed into a nearly insoluble resin  C40 H22 09 that is C40 H23 08  t In like manner mastic resin when so heated is in part changed into C40 H30 05 that is C40 H31 04 o It is reasonable to suppose that the nature of the change which takes place is the same in both and though I do not consider notwithstanding the precautions adopted that the number of atoms of hydrogen in any of the formulhe I have given for the re sins can be considered absolutely certain yet there being a reasonable probability that mastic resin A is represented by C40 H31 04 there is reason from the present analogy to infer that gamboge resin is C40 H23 08 One interesting and important fact may be considered as established whichever of these formulae be adopted that a small change in the number of atoms of hydrogen only may give birth to new resins possessed of very different properties We have for example Colophony  C40 H30 04 Liebig Mastic A  C40 H31 04 represented generally by C40 IH2a 04 the resin of which C40 132 04 is the formula being undetermined And we have also Resin of dragons blood  C40 H21 08 Resin of gamboge   C40 H23 O  And the general formula C40 H24x 08 may represent a second large group of which as in the former only two members are as yet determined In the present stage of our inquiry it would be premature to dwell on theoretical indications as to what we may hereafter expect to meet with but it may be remarked that H32 and H24 seem to point to a series of which H64 H16 and H8 are members and which may respectively form the startingpoints as it were of new groups Salts of Gambodic Acid Gambodiates of Potash and SodaThe salts of the alkaline metals may be formed by dissolving or digesting the acid in solutions of the caustic alkalies In strong so lutions the salt is very ingly soluble sol that by digesting the acid in such solu tion the compounds may easily be obtained in a solid state In colour they are some 284MR JOHNSTON ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RESINS what darker than the pure resin and very soluble in pure water giving reddish brown solutions and though more sparingly yet still largely soluble in alcohol They are decomposed by the dilute mineral acids which precipitate the acid firomn its saline solutions unchanged and in the form of a paleyellow bulky powder Gambodiate of AmmoniaGambodic acid dissolves slowly in dilute caustic amn monia giving a brownishred solution The solution is most readily obtained by adding caustic ammonia to the alcoholic solution of the acid diluting largely with water and distilling or boiling off the alcohol and excess of ammonia Evaporated to dryness at a temperature below 212 FAHR it leaves a brittle resinous mass having the colour of the acid Instead of the fragrant smell of the resin however it has assumed a faint unpleasant animal odour It is insoluble in pure water but dissolves on the addition of a little caustic ammonia It dissolves also in alcohol and is de composed by the mineral acids Boiled in a solution of caustic potash ammonia is evolved and a salt of potash formed Its solution in water precipitates the ammonia nitrate of silver and the ammonia acetate of lead PAYENS salt of a yellow colour and the ammonia sulphate of copper of a darkreddishbrown Earthy and Metallic SaltsOn these salts I have made many experiments with re sults in some cases sufficiently discordant and which led me at first to consider that the equivalent of this resin should be represented by C50o29010 instead of 2 C4123 08 as the analysis of the resin appears to indicate I am now inclined however to adopt the formula containing C40 as entering into the expression for the gambodiates and to attribute the observed differences between experiment and calculation to the difficulty of obtaining these as well as other resinous compounds in a perfectly pure state especially free from mutual admixture To this conclusion I am further led by the study of the salts of mastic resin A of which an account has already been given Properties of the Earthy and Metallic Gambodiates1 When fresh prepared from alcoholic solutions these salts are yellow slightly soluble in alcohlol and insoluble in water When first precipitated from solutions of chloride of calcium and nitrate of strontia by means of ammonia they are of a beautiful red but by standing they sub side yellow Precipitated from ammoniacal aqueous solutions they are brownish or brownishred 2 Collected on the filter after precipitation from alcoholic solutions washed with alcohol and dried by pressure on bibulous paper they are in the form of a beautifil yellow powder in which state they remain if dried by a very gentle heat in the open air raised after a sufficient time to 212 FAHR If immediately on being dried by pressure as much as possible between folds of paper they are exposed to a heat of upwards of 100 FAHR they melt and run into a thin liquid which on cooling solidi fies into a red brittle resin giving a yellow powder This property which is common to these with the salts of many other resins appears to indicate a combination of the salts with alcohol from the last portions of which like the resins themselves they 285MR JOHNSTON ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RESINS are with difficulty separated They may be heated however to 350 or 400 FAHR without decomposition emitting only the fragrant odour characteristic of the gam bodic acid itself At or under this temperature they melt those of the earths ex cepted and on cooling assume the appearance of a reddishbrown resin not unlike the acid and like it giving a beautiful yellow powder At a higher temperature they are decomposed giving off empyreumatic products Thle salt of silver is discoloured by exposure to the air and when dry is of a dirtydarkgreen They are all decom posed by boiling in acetic and dilute nitric acids I had spent much time in preparing these salts by means of alcoholic solutions before I discovered that the resin possesses a property which enables us to prepare very many of its salts from aqueous solutions The garnbodiate of ammonia being soluble in dilute ammonia and not precipitable by water it is sufficient to add caustic ammonia to an alcoholic solution of the resin and to dilute with water when the addition of an ammoniacal solution of magnesia oxide of manganese oxide of copper oxide of zinc acetate of lead or of any other oxide soluble in caustic ammonia causes a pre cipitate of the corresponding gambodiate of a brownishred colour By washing with dilute ammonia these may be obtained in a state of comparative purity Analogous compounds mlay be formned by adding an alcoholic solution of tlle resin to similar so lutions of the metallic salts with or without the addition of ammonia A Salts of Lead1 When a solution of the resin in alcohol is mixed with one of acetate of lead a yellow precipitate falls Washed with alcohol and dried per cent a At  212 FAHR 11425 grs gave 2224 oxide of lead 19466 b After fusion at 370 FAHR 1303 grs gave 258 oxide of lead  1980 A second portion thrown down from a solution in which a large excess of resin was present gave only 1736 per cent of oxide A sesquisalt  3 C40 1123 O8  2 Pb 0 contains 1832 per cent of oxide and it will be recollected that mnastic resin A in similar circumstances gave also a sesquisaltt 2 To the mixed solutions as above after the precipitate was separated caustic am monia was added with agitation The new precipitate was also yellow but when washed and dried 1474 grs gave only 2046 or 1388 per cent of oxide of lead This agrees with the formula Pb 0  2 C40 H23 O which contains 1440 per cent of oxide though it is not easy to understand why a bisalt should be thrown down when the solution is rendered more neutral by the addition of ammonia 3 An aInmoniacal solution of the resin was diluted with water and a solution of PAYENs ammoniacal subacetate of lead was added to it A yellow precipitate fell which was collected carefilly washed and dried at 212 FAHR At a low heat it took fire and burned like tinder without melting  This property renders gamboge of great value for experimental illustration of the properties of the resins in the Classroom t Vid ante p 124 286MR JOHNSTON ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RESINS 10733 grs left 5284 grs of oxide of lead  49231 per cent This indicates three of base to one of acid thle formula 3 Pb 0  C40 H23 08 requiring 5023 per cent and this tribasic salt is precisely the analogue of the tribasic acetate from which it is formed After being digested in acetic acid and again washed and dried this salt lost five sixths of its base becoming a bisalt Thus 11 066 grains left 1635 of oxide of lead  14777 per cent the formula as already stated requiring 1440 per cent That an acid salt should be formed under these circumstances is what we shlould expect but whether a bisalt is the constant result I have not determined B Salts of Copper1 A dilute antnmoniacal solution of the resin in water was mixed with one of ammoniacosulphate of copper a brownislyellow precipitate fell which was washed with dilute anmmonia and dried at 212 FAHR 11037 burned in the air left 1197 Cu  1 0845 per cent 13455 of another portion left 1 40 Cu  10405 per cent A portion of the dry salt after boiling in dilute ammonia still left 10 994 per cent of oxide These results indicate a neutral salt the formula Cu  C40 H23 O0 requiring 1068 per cent of oxide of copper 2 A further portion of the salt was prepared by adding the ammoniacal resin to a solution of common sulphate of copper and as this might contain excess of oxide one portion of it was digested while moist in hot dilute ammonia When dried it left in two experiments 18951 and 18830 of oxide per cent respectively Another por tion was boiled in strong caustic ammonia by which as appeared from the colour of the solution a portion of tile acid was taken up Washed dried and burned it left 14666 per cent of oxide of copper The former result agrees with 2 Cu  C40 H23  which requires 1931 per cent of oxide The latter agrees with 3 Cu  2 C40 HI 08 which requires 1521 per cent of oxide It is impossible however without several repetitions of these experiments to say that these coincidences are more than accidental though fronm analogy it appears probable that such compounds do exist Above all their true nature can only be known by the ultimate analysis of the saltsa work of great labour but which I do not despair of being able to undertake By varying the mode of preparation I ob tained a copper salt by direct precipitation containing 14824 per cent of oxide agreeing with one of those just described But if the three classes of salts above ob tained be constant and definite the circumstances under which they may be formed without failure requires further study C Salts of ZincThe gambodiate of zinc is obtained by mixing the ammoniacal  The equivalent of oxide of copper being 495695 MDCCCXXXIX 2 P 287MR JOHNSTON ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RESINS resin with a solution of zinc in ammonia or with an ammoniacal solution of sulphate of zinc It is of a brownishyellow colour If the solution be too largely diluted with water an excess of oxide of zinc is apt to be thrown down along with the salt Thus the first portion I prepared gave me 1417 per cent of oxide of zinc while another plrepared with more carle gave me in two experiments 11242 and 10976 per cent respectively A neutral salt  Zn 0  C40 H23 08 contains 1083 per cent oxide of zinc D Salts of Lime Strontia and Magnesiaa To alcoholic solutions of chloride of calcium and of nitrate of strontia ammonia was added and afterwards a solution of gamlbodic acid in alcohol The former gave an abundant the latter a very sparing precipitate The mixed solutions at first became of a beautiful red colour but the precipitate as it fell graduially assumed a more yellow shade Washed with out access of air and dried at 360 the lime salt gave in two experiments 6119 and 6192 per cent of lime the strontia salt gave 9877 per cent of strontia If these results are to be depended upon they indicate a sesquisalt in both cases since Ca  1 C40 H23 08 contains 572 per cent of lime and Sr  12 C40 II23 O8 contains 943 per cent of strontia b The ammoniacal resin in water gives with ammoniacal sulphate of magnesia a copious precipitate which dried and burned yielded 4542 and 4681 per cent of magnesia which however is not reconcileable to any formula E Salts of Silver1 Newly precipitated oxide of silver digested in gambodic acid in alcohol gave a darkbrown salt which fused at 360 FAHR and of which when burned 20335 grains left 546 of silver  28762 per cent of oxide A neutral salt AgO  C40 H23 0 contains 2594 per cent to which the salt above obtained ap proximates It will be readily understood that very careful agitation would be re quired to bring all thle particles of the oxide introduced in the state of powder into contact with the resin held in solution and that an excess of silver is to be expected in a salt prepared by such a process 2 When an alcoholic solution of the resin is poured into a similar solution of ni trate of silver no precipitate falls but if the mixture be allowed to stand for some time the inside of the glass vessel becomes covered with a coating of metallic silver and a small quantity of a black powder gradually falls to the bottom The same effect follows if the resin of dragons blood be used and in a still morle mnarked manner with the pure resin of guaiacum If ammonia be added a yellow precipitate falls which is speedily discoloured by the air and ultimately becomes darkgreen Care fully dried 694 grains left 100 grain of silver  15475 per cent of oxide of silver 7766 grains left 1146 grains of silver  15848 per cent of oxide of silver 2S8MR JOIINSTON ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RESINS These results indicate the formnation as was the case with mastic resin A of a Ii salt containing also like the salt of that resin a small excess of silver The formula Ag O  2 C40 H3 O requires 1490 per cent of oxide of silver 3 Into an aqueous solution of ammonia nitrate of silver an ammoniacal solution of gambodic acid was slowly poured with agitation a yellow precipitate began to fall which redissolved on a fultlher addition of the resin and was again thrown down on adding ammoniacal nitrate of silver The yellow precipitate gradually collected into brown flocks and formed a brown coherent sediment leaving the supernatant liquid of a pale yellow colour The lprcipitate was well wasled with distilled water collected on the filteil and dricld at 250 FAIAn till at tlhat temnperature it ceasedt to soften 1317 grains blurned in the air left 1P17 of mletallic silveir or 954 per cent of oxide 7866 grains left 0725 of silver  990 pet cent of oxide A salt consisting of three equivalents of acid to one of base or Ag 0  3 C40 H23 08 contains 1022 of oxide of silver We may safely consider the compound prepared by tills mnetliod tlierefore as a tersalt the excess of ammonia present probably re taining the silver in solution so as to prevent its forning a more basic combination It is not unlikely that by varying tlhe process a bisalt Ilight be obtained from aqueous solutions similar to that which was given by alcoholic solutions Constitution of the Salts of Gambodic Acid Of tile salts above dlescribed I have subljected to ultimate

that the metal replaces an equal number of equivalents of hydrogen when it combines with the resin and they support rather the other view which would re present the normal state of the acid resin to be that in which it exists when in a state of combination and that the hydrogen contained in their salts of the metallic oxides is the true quantity which enters into the composition of these bodies ConclusionsFrom the preceding investigation it appears 1 That the niost probable formula for gamboge resin is C40 HI23 O8 though all the specimens analysed yield too little carbon by nearly one per cent This deficiency is supposed to be due to a change produced during the preparation of the natural resin for the market 2 When lheated to about 400 FAHR it undergoes partial decomposition a resin soluble in cold alcohol being formed and another insoluble in that liquid The con stitution of the latter seems to be represented by C40 H22 09 3 It forms with the nietallic oxides numerous classes of salts the existence and constitution of which the preceding experiments must be conlsidered as only rendering probable A complete study of the resinous salts and of the circumstances under which the several classes of them are necessarily formed though it would involve much labour would probably lead to interesting results The various saline com pounds obtained as above described may be classed

it is nearly all dissolved giving a darkbrown solution On evaporating this solution in a flat dish and heating it for twelve hours at a temperature rising from 1800 to about 2500 FAHR a very beautiful transparent rubycoloured resin is obtained brittle and electric melting at 212 FAHR and emitting an agreeable fragrant odour Of this resin thus carefully dried A 10647 grs gave C  27167 and H1  6585 B

of gamboge which as we have already seen may be represented by Resin of dragons blood C40 H21 8O Resin of gamboge    C40 H23 O Resin of guaiacum   C40 H23 010 Salts of Guaiacum ResinWhen the solution of this resin in alcohol is added to an alcoholic solution of acetate of lead in excess a white precipitate falls which be comes blue on exposure to the suns rays After separating the precipitate am monia throws down a further portion from the supernatant liquid I have analysed three successive portions of the first of these compounds which contains two equiva lents of oxide of lead to forty of ecarbon but the results are so little l concordant wit the analysis of the uncombined resin as to render further investigation necessary With nitrate of silver this resin gives no precipitate but on standing exposed to the light the silver in considerable quantity is thrown down in the metallic state I have not examined what change of composition the resin undergoes during this de oxidation of the metal  A delicate photogenic paper may be formed by first washing with an alcoholic solution of guaiacum resin and afterwards with one of neutral acetate of leadMR JOHNSTON ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RESINS V Acaroid Resin Botany Bay Resin Yellow Gum This resin exuldes from the Xanthorrhcea hastilis is of a darker reddish yellow colour than gamboge comes to this country generally mixed with the spines and bark of the tree gives in alcohol and ether a much darker solution than gamnboge and a darker resin when evaporated It emits also a peculiar fragrant odour when melted and differs further from gamboge in being almost entirely precipitated by water from its solution in alcohol even when much ammonia has been added Dried in a thin film at 2500 FAHR for twelve hours A 11655 grs gave C  28523 and H  6036 B 11 61 grs gave I  6048 and of another portion similarly heated C 10236 grs gave C  25204 and H  5258 A B C Carbon   6767 68085 Hydrogen  5 75 578 5707 Oxygen  2658 26208

no doubt an error of experiment This resin therefore belongs also to the group represented by the general expres sion C40 HI24 Oy and it contains more oxygen than any other resinous substance hitherto analysed General RemarkIn so far as we are entitled to draw general conclusions from the analyses contained in this and the preceding paper it appears 1 That many of the resins may be represented by formulae exhibiting their ele mentary constitution and the weight of their equivalents in which 40 C is a constant quantity 2 That there appear to be groups in which the equivalents both of the carbon and the hydrogen are constant the oxygen only varying and others in which the hydrogen alone varies the two other elements being constant In a subsequent paper I hope to extend further these first

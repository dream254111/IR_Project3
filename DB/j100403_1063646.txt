The first case cannot be considered as holding that an order cannot be made in any case to take an Xray picture of a plaintiffs injury since the order which was reversed on appeal did not provide that the examination should be made as required by the statute The last decision was by a divided court and was wholly based on the ground that at that time there was danger in taking radiographs The comparatively small element of danger involved in making a blood test and the necessity for such a test to accurately determine the con dition of the plaintiff as sworn to by the examining physician would seem to justify the decision in the instant case The point at issue here does not seem to have arisen in Virginia EVIDENCEEXTRAJUDICIAL CONFESSION UNCORROBORATED BY INDEPENDENT EVIDENCE OF CORPUS DELICTI WILL NOT WARRANT CONVICTIONDefendant was indicted with other employees of a corporation for the larceny of certain goods from stock obtained by means of alleged fictitious order and cash slips such as were required by the companys business system Defendant acknowledged receipt of the goods claiming to have bought them in the usual and proper course of business at their true value with out any conspiracy to defraud The prosecution offered evidence of a confession by the defendant to the superintendent of the company which was admitted over defendants objection but there was no evidence to show any fraudulent connection of defendant or his alleged confederates with the cash slip necessary to procure delivery sf the goods Defendant was convicted and upon an order denying a motion for a new trial ap pealed alleging error in the admission of the confession uncorroborated by independent evidence of the corpus delicti Held new trial granted State v Wylic Minn 186 N W 707

to have been satisfactorily settled in England Reg v Sullivan Ire 16 Cox C C 347 1887 Reg v Unkles Ir R 8 C L 50 1874 Whelings Case 1 Leach 311 n 1789 The English rule if there is one that a confession in a criminal case must be supported by corroborative evidence specifically relative to the corpus delicti seems at least to be restricted to cases of homicide Reg v Sul livan supra The decisions in the United States may be divided into three classes 1 The majority rule requires that a confession be corroborated by independent evidence which must particularly concern the corpus delicti in order to warrant a conviction thereon nor is the rule restricted to cases of homicide Bines v State 118 Ga 320 45 S E 376 68 L R A 33 and excellent note 1903 Stringfellowu v State 26 Miss

as to whether corroboration is necessary at all Comm v Killion 194 Mass 153 80 N E 222 1907 Republic v Tokuji 9 Haw 548 1894 In North Carolina it seems that a prisoner may be convicted upon his own voluntary and unbiased confession with out other evidence but in the case in which this doctrine was laid down there was corroborative evidence tending to prove the corpus delicti State v Cowan 29 N C

Rep R 1062 1664 Virginia seems to adhere to the majority rule Smith v Com 21 Gratt 809 1871 INTOXICATING LIQUORSACQUISITION OF EVIDENCEEVIDENCE HELD TO SHOW SEARCH BY STATE OFFICERS WAS UNDER DIRECTION OF FEDERAL OFFI CERSCertain conferences were held between State police officers and federal prohibition authorities to obtain a closer cooperation between them in the enforcement of the prohibition law The State officers were informed as to the evidence necessary in prosecutions under the prohi bition law and were instructed to turn persons arrested and the evidence obtained against them over to the federal authorities But the federal authorities had no special knowledge or issued no special directions in each specific case After these conferences had taken place the premises of the accused were searched by the State officers without a warrant and property used in the manufacture of liquor was seized and turned over to the federal authorities Application was made to suppress the evi dence thus obtained Held application granted United States v Falloco 277 Fed 75 1922 Since the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution as lim itations upon the use of evidence improperly obtained apply only to federal officers liquor in the unlawful possession of a defendant which is seized on a search by State officers without a warrant and without acting under the authority of federal authorities is notwithstanding its unlaw ful seizure admissible in evidence on the trial of the defendant in a federal court United States v ODowd 273 Fed 600 1921 Weeks v United

papers have been unlawfully seized by a private in dividual without the knowledge or connivance of any officer of the fed eral government and then turned over to the federal government does not prevent their being used in a criminal prosecution against the owner Burdeau v McDowell 41 Sup Ct 574 1921 620

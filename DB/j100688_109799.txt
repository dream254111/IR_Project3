of this and the two former experiments without makifig allowance for the imperfect polish of the Cassegrainian in one of them gives the comparative superiority in the illuminating power of the Cassegrainian more than 2 to 1 or if the experiment which the au thor considers less perfect be rejected it would appear to be 2 to I in favour of the Cassegrainian construction Astronomical Observations relating to the sidereal part of the Heavens and its Connexion with the nebulous part arrangedfor the purpose of a critical Examination By William Herschel LLD FRS Read February 24 1814 Phil Trans 1814 p 248 In a former communication to the Society the author endeavoured to show the probability of a progressive condensation of nebulous matter so as to put on ultimately the appearance of stars his pre sent object is to show by reference to select cases from many thou sand former observations on record that a similar operation of gra dual condensation is also taking place among condensed clusters of visible stars and consequently to render it probable that an intimate connexion subsists between these extremes and that the same pro cess of condensation continues from one end of the series to the other so that the most perfect stars may possibly have originated from an accumulation of mere nebulous matter His first observations indeed relate to a more direct communica tion between present stars and contiguous nebulosity in different relative positions In some instances a single star appears to be attracting to itself a branch of nebulosity seen extending from one of its sides in others two adjacent stars appear to have equal power over a linear portion of nebula that extends from one to the other The portions of nebula however that are adjacent to different single stars vary considerably in their appearance Of those nebu lous branches that extend only on one side some have parallel sides some are fanshaped others are in a considerable degree irregular Some stars have extended nebulosity on opposite sides in a line of which they occupy the centre Round others it appears diffused equally as in a globular form on all sides and in some instances such a globular nebula apparently includes a cluster of several stars together All these appearances afford a presumption that stars and nebulae are drawn together by mutual attraction and that the acces sion of such a quantity of matter as must be contained in an exten sive nebula will ultimately cause what may be called the growth of stars What in its first state appeared as a globular nebula alone would by condensation present the appearance of a nucleus in its centre The globular nebula with nucleus would by increasing con densation become a nebulous star its next state would be that of a distinct star with surrounding nebulosity and the last result would be the perfect simple star495 The author observes however that in the instances which present themselves of such connexion between stars and nebulae which are the two extremes of the series the nebulosity may not always be a remnant of the unsubsided nebulous matter from which they were originally formed but detached portions of nebulous matter may like stars have a considerable proper motion and may be intercepted in their course by clusters of stars or by the more powerful attrac tion of a single star of great magnitude by which they will in still less time be absorbed In Dr Herschels endeavours to arrange the vast accumulation of observations already recorded on this subject there are many phenomena too ambiguous to admit of classification but this he observes will necessarily occur at every period in the progressive improvement of telescopes since a greater power of pe netrating into space which would be sufficient to render all present objects distinct would bring into view a still greater number of ap pearances requiring a still further extension of our powers to com prehend After arranging the various instances of gradation in which nebu losity appears successively more and more condensed whether with or without intervening stars the author examines aggregations of stars alone referring to many former observations of patches of stars which at the time of recording them he was induced to callforming clusters in consequence of some appearances of a tendency to approach which he inferred from the greater density of such clusters toward their centre This apparent propensity to cluster seemed chiefly visible in parts of the heavens extremely rich in stars and Dr Her schel refers to about 150 instances of such an appearance in the Milky Way but generally of an irregular form and very imperfectly col lected Of other clusters in which more of regularity is observable a more particular description is given The various degrees of compression of different clusters are also noticed with references to numerous instances by classes in which they are now arranged Some of these are visible with ordinary telescopes others are selected as fine objects for good telescopes and others again on account of their higher compression cannot be resolved without the aid of very superior telescopes The form also of those most compressed is observed to partake more or less of a spherical form Thirtynline instances are quoted in which the form is oval in various degrees But objects of this de scription can hardly be seen to advantage without a twentyfeet telescope Others again and very numerous are referred to disco vered as globular nebulae with common telescopes but resolved into stars by telescopes of high magnifying as well as spacepenetrating power and as these are accordingly but little known Dr Herschel selects from numerous observations that he has made during four andthirty years various nebulae classed according to the telescopes with which he had observed them as a guide to those who may wish to view them that they may be able to judge which objects may pos sibly be within the power of the telescopes they happen to possess496 Since the luminous appearance of the Milky Way is caused by stars that are invisible to the naked eye this part of the heavens pre sents a vast field for observation on the existence of a clustering power To the naked eye it is visibly divided into large patches  and a telescope shows it to be still further subdivided into unequal groups which though now not completely detached it is presumed will hereafter become insulated so that the Milky Way will finally be broken up and cease to be a stratum of clustered stars The same mode of reasoning that leads the imagination to con ceive the progressive changes of its future existence involves also the supposition of its origin at some period certainly very remote but which it may possibly be in the power of future astronomers to estimate by means of accurate observations on the rate of those changes that may be discovered to have taken place in the course of ages yet to come With respect however to the extent in space of that portion of infinity through which any objects are discernible and the arrange ment and relative distances of all celestial bodies yet observed the author is of opinion that some present judgement may be formed and he is now engaged in a series of observations with a view to investigate the visible extent of the universe On a new principle of constructing His Majestys Ships of War By Robert Seppings Esq one of the Surveyors of His Majestys Navy Communicated by the Right Hon Sir Joseph Banks Bart KB PRS Read March 10 1814 Phil Trans 1814 p 285 After remarking upon the length of time that has elapsed since any considerable improvement has taken place in the art of ship building and the causes that appear to have prevented amendments being introduced the author gives a general outline of the structure of ships as hitherto built which he represents as consisting generally of pieces of timber or plank all placed nearly at right angles to each other For first the ribs rise at right angles to the keel The ribs are crossed on their inner as well as outer side with planks at right angles to them and parallel to the keel And within the inner linings are also a secondary series of ribs called riders at some distance from each other parallel to the former set and at right angles to the keel Across this fabric are placed beams connecting the opposite sides of the vessel and these also are at right angles to all the parts before mentioned From beam to beam at right angles are the carlings which support joists parallel to the beams on which are laid the planks of the deck in a right line from head to stern and accord ingly preserving uniform adherence to the parallel and rectangular structure which in every other instance of carpentry is known to every common mechanic to be the weakest form in which any num ber of lines can be framed together as it affords no check to that bending of the materials to which they are liable in the direction of their greatest length To this cause is to be ascribed the wellknown

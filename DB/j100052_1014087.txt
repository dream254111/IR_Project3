J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1014087,THE CASE FOR HOLLAND,I242662,THE CASE FOR HOLLAND BY A G A VAN EELDE MEMBER OF THE NETHERLANDS MISSION TO THE UNITED STATES ON JULY 31 1914 HOLLAND BEGAN MOBILIZING ITS ARMY AND NAVY SUBSEQUENTLY SET TO INCREASING AND EQUIPPING THEM AND NOW MAIN TAINS ON A WAR FOOTING ABOUT HALF A MILLION OF MEN IT ACTED THUS NOT WITH A VIEW TO JOIN THE CAUSE OF EITHER OF THE BELLIGERENTS BUT TO BE IN A POSITION TO WARD OFF ANY HOSTILE ATTEMPT ON THE INTEGRITY OF ITS TERRITORY HOME AND ABROAD IT PUBLICLY DECLARED ITS FIRM DETERMINATION TO REMAIN NEUTRAL THE NUMBER OF THOSE CRITICIZING THIS LINE OF CONDUCT WAS OF NO CONSEQUENCE IN HOLLAND BUT RATHER EXTENSIVE ABROAD IT WAS THE LATTER AVERRED INCONSISTENT WITH THE POLICYOF HOLLAND AS CHRONICLED IN HISTORY AND NOT CONFORMABLE TO THE SPIRIT OF THE NATION WHICHTHE CASE FOR HOLLAND 75 WAS WELL KNOWN TO BE LIBERTYLOVING AND ANTIMILITARISTIC BEFORE LONG HOWEVER THE DISSENTING VOICES BECAME FAINT AND LESS NUMER OUS THE OPINION BEGAN TO PREVAIL THAT INTERVENTION OF HOLLAND IN THE WAR COULD ONLY BE DONE AT A RUINOUS COST TO ITSELF WOULD BE OF NO MATERIAL ADVANTAGE TO ANYBODY AND UNLIKELY TO PROMOTE JUSTICE UNTIL AT THE PRESENT MOMENT ALL OPENMINDED CRITICS ADMIT THE WISDOM OF HOLLANDS DECISION TO STAND ALOOF SHOWING A BOLD FACE ON ALL SIDES ON THE ONE HAND READY TO SEVERELY PUNISH ALL COMERS WHO WERE EVILLY AFFECTED ON THE OTHER TO EXTEND ITS ALLEVIATING HANDS TO THE SUFFERERS OF ALL NATIONS THOSE HOWEVER WHO THINK THAT HOLLAND ACTING AS IT DOES HAS A CHANCE OF COMING OFF WITH A WHOLE SKIN ARE UNDER A MISAPPREHEN SION WHAT WITH THE UPKEEP OF AN ABNORMALLY SIZED ARMY THE HOUSING AND BOARDING OF THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF INTERNED SOLDIERS AND REFUGEES WHAT WITH THE GOVERNMENT DISTRIBUTION OF FOODSTUFFS AND OTHER COMMODITIES TO ITS POPULATION AT PRICES FAR BELOW THE ABSURDLY ENHANCED COST PRICES HOLLAND IS COMPELLED TO RAISE LOANS AND TAXES OF UNPRECEDENTED MAGNITUDE THE EVER INCREASING DIFFICULTIES AND DANGERS AT SEA SERIOUSLY THREATEN ITS MERCANTILE AND FISHING FLEETS FOR WERE IT NOT FOR THE UNDAUNTED DETERMINATION OF ITS SAILORS AND FISHERMEN WHO NEVER FLINCH NO MATTER WHAT PERILS ARE IMPENDING OVER THEM THE SUPPLIES OF INDISPENSABLE VICTUALS WOULD HAVE RUN OUT LONG SINCE AS IT IS SUPPLIES ARE SCANTY ALL HOLLAND IS CLAMORING FOR MORE BREAD AND FUEL FARMERS ARE CRYING OUT FOR FERTILIZERS STOCK OWNERS FOR FEEDING STUFFS MANUFACTURERS FOR COAL AND RAW MATERIALS FOR HOLLAND IS NOT A SELFSUPPORTING COUNTRY IN THE ACTUAL SENSE OF THE WORD FORMERLY WHEN MEANS OF CONVEYANCE WERE LIMITED TO THE EFFORTS OF HUMAN AND ANIMAL PHYSICAL POWER HOLLAND DERIVED ITS NECESSA RIES OF LIFE MAINLY FROM ITS OWN SOIL ON THE VICTORIOUS ENTRANCE HOWEVER OF THE STEAM ENGINE TRANSPORTESPECIALLY MARINE TRANS PORTBECAME SWIFT CHEAP AND RELIABLE THE DUTCH FARMER REALIZED THAT CEREALS COULD BE GROWN IN AMERICA AND LANDED IN HIS OWN COUNTRY AT LESS COST THAN HE COULD RAISE THEM AT HOME HE STOPPED TILLING THE SOIL PROMPTLY TURNED HIS ARABLE LANDS INTO GRASSLANDS AND APPLIED HIMSELF TO CATTLE RAISING HIS EFFORTS RESULTING IN THE CREATION OF A CATTLE BREED JUSTLY RENOWNED ALL THE WORLD OVERNOT THE LEAST IN THE UNITED STATESFOR ITS MILK PRODUCING QUALITIES THE MANUFACTURER IN THE MEANTIME KEPT PACE WITH THE FARMER76 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY HE LEFT TO OTHERS THE PROVIDING OF ARTICLES WHICH COULD BE LANDED MORE CHEAPLY FROM ELSEWHERE AND LIMITED HIMSELF TO THE MANUFAC TURE OF SUCH ARTICLES BEST ADAPTED TO THE CONDITIONS OF HIS COUNTRY IMPORTING HIS RAW MATERIALS FROM ABROAD THUS IT CAME TO PASS THAT HOLLAND LIKE ENGLAND AND LIKE ENG LAND ALONE BECAME A FREE TRADING COUNTRY PRODUCING WHAT IT IS BEST ADAPTED TO PRODUCE DEPENDING FOR MOST OF ITS CEREALS FUEL AND RAW MATERIALS ON THE AVAILABLE SURPLUS PRODUCTION IN OTHER COUNTRIES IMPORTED INTO HOLLAND PRACTICALLY DUTY FREE ONLY ONEFOURTH OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF WHEAT AND RYE NEEDED FOR BREAD FOR THE POPULATION OF HOLLAND AND THE MULTITUDE OF ITS GUESTS GROWS ON DUTCH SOIL THE BALANCE USED TO BE IMPORTED FROM THE BALTIC PROVINCES FROM THE BLACK SEA PROVINCES AND FROM AMER ICA THE TWO FORMER SOURCES BEING CUT OFF IMMEDIATELY AFTER WAR BROKE OUT STOCKS OF WHEAT AND RYE BEGAN TO FALL DANGEROUSLY LOW IN HOLLAND IN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER OF 1914 CAUSING THE GOVERNMENT TO STEP IN AND TO ESTABLISH AN ORGANIZATION OF ITS OWN FOR THE PUR CHASE THE TRANSPORTATION AND HOME DISTRIBUTION OF SAID CEREALS THE GOVERNMENT RECKONING ANDAS SUBSEQUENT EVENTS PROVED NOT IN VAIN ON THE FARMERS OF ITS OLD FRIEND OF LONG TRIED STANDING THE UNITED STATES WAS ENABLED TO REALIZE ITS DESIGNS AVERT THE THREATENING BREAD SCARE AND TO CREATE A SENSE OF SECURITY BREAD HOWSOEVER WAS PROCURABLE IN DIMINISHED RATIONS ONLY THE SENSE OF SECURITY FOLLOWING UPON THIS ACTION OF THE GOVERN MENT WAS NOT CONFINED TO HOLLAND ALONE IT SPREAD TO BELGIUM AND TO THE NORTH OF FRANCE THE AMERICAN COMMISSION FOR THE RELIEF OF BELGIUM IN ITS UNTIRING EFFORTS TO SUPPLY THE NEEDFUL TO MILLIONS OF INDIGENT MEN WOMEN AND CHILDRENA GIGANTIC SELFCONSTITUTED TASKONCE IN A WHILE RAN UP AGAINST THE VICISSITUDES OF FATE AND FOUND ITSELF SHORT OF PROVISIONS SELF PRAISE IS NO RECOMMENDATION BUT THE BELGIAN RELIEF COMMISSION WILL BEAR WITNESS TO THE FACT THAT IN SUCH TIMES OF EMERGENCY THE HOLLAND GOVERNMENT WAS EVER WILLING TO OPEN THE DOORS OF ITS STOREROOMS THEREBY RELEASING THE ANXIETY OF THE COMMISSION AND ITS CROWD OF FAMINE THREATENED CLIENTS ON THOSE OCCASIONS THE PEOPLE OF HOLLAND WITHOUT EXCEP TION STOOD BY ITS GOVERNMENT OF LATE HOWEVER THINGS ARE SHAPING DIFFERENTLY THE UNITED STATES HITHERTO A NEUTRAL JOINED THE BELLIGERENTS AND WAS COM PELLED SO AS TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF SELF AND ALLIES TO STOP THETHE CASE FOR HOLLAND 77 EXPORTATION OF SUNDRY COMMODITIES AMONG THEM CEREALS PENDING THE RESULT OF STOCK TAKING SUBSEQUENTLY THE SENSE OF SECURITY IN HOLLAND IN BELGIUM AND IN THE NORTH OF FRANCE IS GIVING PLACE TO A FEELING OF UNREST WHAT BETWEEN THE ALARMING NEWS THAT NO MORE GRAINLADEN SHIPS ARE TO BE EXPECTED IN THE PORTS OF HOLLAND WITHIN MEASURABLE TIME AND THE PROSPECT OF THE IMPORTATION OF THE PRECIOUS CEREALS BEING STOPPED ALTOGETHER ONCE MORE THE FEAR OF AN APPROACH ING BREAD SCARE IS LOOMING UP IN THE MINDS OF THE PEOPLE OF HOLLAND OF BELGIUM AND OF SUCH PORTIONS OF FRANCE AS ARE OCCUPIED TODAY BY THE GERMANS BREAD RATIONS IN ITOLLAND HAVE BEEN REDUCED FROM 88 OF A POUND TO 56 OF A POUND PER DAY THE IMPORTATION OF FERTILIZERS AND FEEDING STUFFS ALTHOUGH A MATTER OF SECOND CONSIDERATION IN COMPARISON WITH WHEAT AND RYE IS OF VITAL IMPORTANCE TO HOLLAND LACK OF FERTILIZERS WOULD PRE CLUDE FARMERS AND CATTLE BREEDERS FROM TURNING THEIR GRASSLANDS TO ACCOUNT IN SUMMER WHILE WANT OF FEEDING STUFFS WOULD RENDER THE UPKEEP OF CATTLE IN WINTER TIME WELL NIGH AN IMPOSSIBILITY CESSA TION OF IMPORTATION WOULD THEREFORE BE ALMOST ON A PAR WITH A NA TIONAL CALAMITY IT WOULD INVOLVE THE IMMEDIATE SLAUGHTERING OF ROUGHLY HALF A MILLION CATTLE HALF A MILLION PIGS AND HALF A MILLION SHEEP IT WOULD PUT A STOP TO ALL EXPORTATION TO ALLIES AND CENTRALS ALIKE INVOLVING DEARTH OF FUEL AND RAW INDUSTRIAL MATERIALS WHICH HOLLAND IS IN THE HABIT OF EXCHANGING AGAINST ITS SURPLUS PRODUCTION DEPRIVED OF THE MEANS FOR CARRYING ON SUCH INTERCHANGE IN OTHER WORDS THROWN EXCLUSIVELY ON ITS OWN RESOURCES HOLLAND MIGHT BE ABLE TO DRAG ON ITS EXISTENCE BUT ONLY AT AN EXCESSIVE COST AND RISK NEARLY A MILLION OF ITS INHABITANTS ABOUT ONESEVENTH OF ITS POPULA TION WOULD HAVE TO WALK THE STREETS UNEMPLOYED LATELY RUMORS ARE AFLOAT GIVING RISE TO THE BELIEF THAT THE ALREADY MATERIALLY REDUCED IMPORTATION OF FERTILIZERS AND FEEDING STUFFS WILL BE CAUSED TO STOP ALTOGETHER HOLLAND REALIZING THE FAR4EACHING CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH A CONTINGENCY IS ANXIOUSLY WATCHING COMING EVENTS IT IS A DUTY INCUMBENT ON EVERY NATION TO PASS IN REVIEW FROM TIME TO TIME ITS CONDUCT IN THE PAST ESPECIALLY SO AFTER A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS OF WARFARE NOW ELAPSED HOLLAND CAN SET OUT FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS DUTY WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE FULLY CONFIDING IN THE HONESTY OF ITS PURPOSE AND THE WISDOM OF ITS LEADERS CHOSEN THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF ITS DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AT THE OPENING OF THE WAR IT TOOK UP ITS STAND AS A NEUTRAL78 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY POWER A POSITION CRITICIZED AT FIRST BY SOME LATER ON ADMITTED AS BEING CORRECT BY ALL BUT A FEW IT HAS SINCE ACTED UP TO ITS OBLIGA TIONS PLAYING A FAIR AND OPEN GAME WITH EVERYBODY HONESTLY EN DEAVORING TO APPLY THE SAME STANDARD TO ALL BELLIGERENTS IT HAS SUFFERED AND IS STILL SUFFERING BUT IT STRONGLY FEELS THE UNBECOMINGNESS OF ACCENTUATING ITS OWN BURDENS WHILE MILLIONS OF FELLOWMEN ARE SACRIFICING THEIR ALL AND THEREFORE HOLLAND ABSTAINS FROM DOING SO AT THE SAME TIME THERE MUST BE NO MISUNDERSTAND ING IF A MAN HAS A CLEAR CONSCIENCE HE HAS EVIDENTLY A CLEAR CASE AND IS ENTITLED TO A RESPECTFUL HEARING AND AN IMPARTIAL JUDGMENT THE CASE FOR HOLLAND IS A7 CLEAR ONE SHE EXPECTS WITH CONFI DENCE UNBIASED TREATMENT

Antarc tic in the years 189495 when a landing was effected on the assumed Antarctic Con tinent at Cape Adare and his opinions and estimates are deserving of respectful con sideration He confidently assumes that a joint commercial and scientific expedition could be arranged so as to render its out come largely profitable to investors even to the extent of 500 or more and yet so direc ted as to place it mainly to the purposes of scientific investigation In his various esti mates however which cover the purchase of one or more suitable steamers the abso lute hiring of fall officers and crews the amount of capital required is so large 9 000 to 14000 as to render an association in this form of combined enterprise doubt fully desirable Your Committee believe that an expenditure of 40000 to 50000 or perhaps even less would suffice to construct an independent scientific expedition of its own which would be in every way if we may judge by past experience and results to be preferred to an expedition whose as sociations must be largely commercial Your Committee believe that independent subscriptions to the extent of 40000 or 50000 could be obtained at this time only with great and united effort and yet it is by no means impossible that patrons of ex ploration may be found who would gener ously contribute to the fund of a properly organizing expedition And it is almost certain that Arctic and Antarctic enter prises despite the generous criticisms which are meted out to them in various quarters will for a long time receive the favor of American goodwill and protection It seems very probable also that a selected number of scientific associations and in stitutions of general learning such as uni versities and colleges might be induced to cooperate to a common end sending repre sentatives to an expedition proportional to amounts of cash subscriptions Your Committee if so desired will be pleased to still further prosecute their in quiry It is with satisfaction that they re port the departure of the Belgian Antarctic Expedition under command of Lieutenant Gerlache and with it the association of the American explorer Dr F A Cook a promi nent member of the Peary Expedition of 189192 Respectfully submitted ANGELO HEILPRIN Chairman Committee on Antarctic Exploration ELIZABETH THOMPSON SCIENCE FUND AT a meeting of the Board of Trustees held at Boston

Secretary CHARLES SEDGWICK MINOT Secretary HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL BOSTON MASS January 22 1898 JOHN A GANO MR JOHN A GANO of Cincinnati Ohio who died on January 15th should be re membered by Amerian scientists as the one who most efficiently encouraged the estab lishment of a system of daily weather pre dictions for the benefit of business men This subject was suggested in my inaugural address as Director of the Observatory in May 1868 and Mr Gano as one of the trustees at once took the matter up for favorable action On the 28th of July I explained it more fully to him and at his request put my ideas in writing for his use as editor of the Cincinnati Commercial In 1869 he became President of the Chamber of Commerce and a second letter from me was requested by him which gave him the 123 desired opportunity to urge the matter upon the attention of that body He appreciated the whole scope and bearing of the pro posed work he appointed the Committee of Conference and in every way forwarded the enterprise with the greatest intelligence and discretion After the Weather Bulletin of the Cincinnati Observatory began to appear September 1 1869 he advocated a still wider extension of the work I had already visited the Chicago Board of Trade and written to the daily papers of New York City hoping to extend the scope of our work In addition to this Mr Gano and Mr William Hooper as delegates to the National Board of Trade meeting at Richmond in November 1869 contem plated bringing our work to the attention of that body but when they found a scheme already formulated by my corre spondent Professor I A Lapham and the Hon H E Paine of Milwaukee and about to be presented by the Hon C D Holton as delegate from the Milwaukee Board of Trade they heartily supported that and on their return to Cincinnati assured me that they regarded a national weather bureau as the inevitable outcome of the work at Cincinnati The Cincinnati Weather Bulletin and predictions of 1869 was really my personal effort to utilize science for the benefit of the people but historically it may also be con sidered as a revival of the reports and maps started by Espy and Henry under the joint auspices of the Federal Government and the Smithsonian Institution in 1848 and main tained at Washington with the co6peration of the various telegraph companies until 1861 Professor Espy was personally well known in Cincinnati where he died in 1857 The merchants of that enterprising city had long been accustomed to secure special weather telegrams to guide them in their business operations and every one re sponded to Mr Ganos endorsement of the JANUARY 28 1898

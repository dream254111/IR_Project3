j100276,Michigan Law Review,1276467,Corporations Right of State to Tax Foreign Corporations for Privilege of Doing Intrastate Business,i254503,MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW fact that a question of an entirely different character was presented to the court in that case In the principal case the district court took it upon itself to investigate all the details of the organization of the plaintiff com pany in spite of the fact that the declaration alleged that the said com pany was a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of Ohio Such an allegation submitted the question of incorporation and organiza tion as an issuable fact Furthermore as the suit pertained to a contro versy concerning a patent right it was one which was cognizable only in the United States courts and no question of diversity of citizenship was involved Hence the declaration set forth a case over which the district court had jurisdiction and it seems that it should have allowed a trial on the merits On the other hand the declaration in The FireProof Hotel Co case disclosed on its face that the plaintiff was a partnership and not a corporation and as the jurisdiction of the court depended entirely upon diversity of citizenship it dismissed the case of its own motion The plaintiffs own admissions were the sole cause of the action taken by the court For similar cases see Louisville Cincinnati  Charles ton R Co v Leston 2 How 497 Ohio  Miss R R Co v Wheeler i Black 286 Steamship Co v Tergman io6 U S II8 Chapman v Barney 129 U S 677 In the principal case the district court did not have the benefit of such admissions and it seems that the circuit court of appeals was correct in its conclusion that the powers of the United States courts have not been extended or enlarged as regards the question raised in The FireProof Hotel Co case by virtue of  37 of the JUDICIAL CODE 1875 on which the district court based its decision CORPORATIONSRIGHT OF STATE TO TAX FOREIGN CORPORATIONS FOR PRIVI LEGE OF

IMPORTANT DECISIONS of the character of the business being transacted by the corporation within the state if it is interstate in nature the state must not interfere but if it is purely intrastate it may prescribe rules and regulations pertaining to it The court in the principal case took into consideration the sum total ofthe business which the company was transacting within that state and it seems that it was clearly justified in adopting this method of investiga tion Kehrer v Stewart 197 U S 60 25 Sup Ct 403 49 L Ed 663 Brown v Houston 114 U S 622 29 L Ed 257 5 Sup Ct IO9I Armour Packing

ribbons paper etc and renting or selling within the state machines rejected by the vendee are all acts which under certain and particular cir cumstances might constitute the doing of a domestic business merely incidental to interstate business Crutcher v Kentucky 141 U S 47 35 LEd 649 ii Sup Ct 85I Kehrer v Stewart 197 U S 60 25 Sup Ct 403 49 L Ed 663 In the principal case however it was discovered that the corporation was doing all of these things and furthermore it was actually shipping the supplies into the state where they came to rest and were comingled with other commodities of like character being offered for sale by the retail merchants of the state The action of the court seems to be substantiated by authority Brown v Houston II4 U S 622 5 Sup Ct IO9I 29 L Ed 257 Woodruff

lots who also owned other property across the street conveyed the west end lot to plaintiff Wright and the east end lot to another party by deeds containing restrictive covenants The two middle lots were conveyed to one Garlock subject to restrictive covenants Garlock conveyed one lot to defendant and the other to plaintiff Beeman and his deeds contained the same covenants as were in the deeds to him from his grantor The covenants in the different deeds were not identical but were substantially alike in fixing a building line and in requiring that only private residences above a stated cost should be erected on the lots Plaintiffs seek to enjoin defendant from using her lot for rooming and boarding purposes Held three justices dissenting that plaintiffs had no cause of action as the covenants were not for the benefit of their lots Wright v Pfrimmer Neb I916 156 N W 06o0 As a general rule in order to entitle the owner of a lot to enforce the restrictions in a deed under which the defendant claims but to which he is not a party he must show that the restriction was inserted to create an easement in favor of his lot and that the defendant purchased the lot with notice Renals v

ENGLAND ADDRESSED TO JOHN HUXHAM M D F R S BY BENJAMIN GALE A M THE SMALL POX BY THE VIGILANT EXECUTION OF THE LAWS SUBSISTING IN THE SEVERAL NEW ENGLAND COLONIES HATH NEVER GE NERALLY PREVAILED AMONG THE INHABITANTS EXCEPTING IN BOSTON THE CAPITAL TOWN IN THE PROVINCE OF THE MASSACHUSETTS BAY WHERE IT HAS BEEN EPIDEMICAL A D 1649 1666 1678 1689 1702 1721 1730 1752 AND AT THIS PRESENT TIME 1764 AND WHERE THE SUCCESS ATTENDING INOCULATION AFTER MUCH OPPOSITION AND ENDEAVOURS USED TO BRING THE SAME INTO DISREPUTE BECAME INCONTESTABLY EVIDENT READ MAY 23 1765 IN THE PROVINCES OF NEW YORK NEW JERSEY AND PENSYLVANIA THE LIKE PRECAUTIONS HAVE NOT BEEN TAKEN AND THE SMALL POX HAS PREVAILED IN THOSE PROVINCES BUT MORE ESPECIALLY IN THE CAPITAL TOWNS AND PLACES ADJACENT ONCE IN ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN YEARS WHERE INOCULATION HATH BEEN PRACTISED WITH SURPRISING SUC CESS TO THE PRESERVATION OF THE LIVES OF MANY A D 1702 THE INHABITANTS OF THE TOWN OF BOSTON WERE 6750 SOULS AT THIS TIME THERE DIED OF THE WHITES 300 A D 1721 THE NUMBER OF THE INHABITANTS WERE 10567 BESIDES THOSE MOVED OUT TO AVOID THE DISEASE THE DISCUMBENTS WERE 5989 V O L LV C C WHEREOF194 WHEREOF 844 DIED I E NEAR ONE IN SEVEN AT THIS TIME IN AND ABOUT BOSTON 286 WERE INOCULATED WHEREOF 6 DIED I E ABOUT 1 IN 48 THIS WAS THE BEGINNING OF INOCULATION IN NEW ENGLAND SOON AFTER IT WAS FIRST PRACTISED IN LONDON  A D 1730 THE DISCUMBENTS WERE ESTIMATED AT 4000 WHEREOF ABOUT 500 DIED OF NOT 400 INOCULATED 12 DIED I E 1 OF 33 A D 1752 THERE WAS AN EXACT ACCOUNT TAKEN BY ORDER OF THE MAGISTRATES OF THE TOWN OF BOSTON AND RENDERED UPON OATH IN ORDER TO REMOVE THE PREJUDICES AND OBJECTIONS MADE AGAINST INOCULATION OF ALL WHO HAD THE SMALL POX EITHER IN THE NATURAL WAY OR BY INOCULATION AND OF THE PRECISE NUMBER OF THOSE WHO DIED OF THE SMALL POX IN EITHER WAY BY WHICH ACCOUNT IT APPEARS THAT THE NUMBER OF THOSE WHO HAD THE DI STEMPER IN THE NATURAL WAY INCLUDING BLACKS AMOUNT ED TO 5544 OF WHICH NUMBER DIED INCLUDING BLACKS 514 THE WHOLE NUMBER INOCULATED INCLUDING BLACKS WAS 2113 OF WHICH DIED INCLUDING BLACKS 30 AT THIS TIME ALL PRESENT HAD THE SMALL POX EXCEPT ABOUT 174 THE TOTAL OF RESIDENTERS IN CLUDING 1544 NEGROES BEING 15734 THOSE WHO FLED FROM THE SMALL POX ESTIMATED AT 1800 HI THERTO MERCURY HAD NOT BEEN MADE USE OF IN INOCU LATION IN BOSTON A D 1764 AT THIS PRESENT WRITING THE SMALL POX IS PREVALENT IN THE TOWN OF BOSTON BY THE LAST AC COUNTS 3000 HAD RECOVED FROM INOCULATION IN THE NEW METHOD BY THE USE OF MERCURY AND 5 ONLY HAD DIED VIZ CHILDREN UNDER 5 YEARS SO THAT IT AP PEARS THAT DEATH WITHOUT INOCULATION IS 1 IN 7 OR 8  DR DOUGLASS SUMMARY HIST VOL II P 395 BY195 BY INOCULATION WITHOUT MERCURY 1 IN 80 OR 100 BY INOCULATION WITH MERCURY 1 IN 800 OR 1000 THE USE OF MERCURY IN THE SMALL POX WAS FIRST HINTED BY THE LEARNED BOERHAAVE WHO DIED IN 1738 THIS INTIMATION WAS IMPROVED AND MERCURY INTRODUCED INTO PRACTICE BY PHYSICIANS IN THE ENGLISH AMERICAN COLONIES ABOUT 1745 SEVERAL AMERICAN PHYSICIANS CLAIM THE SECOND GLORY TO BOERHAAVE DR THOMAS OF VIRGINIA AND DR MURISON OF LONG ISLAND IN THE PROVINCE OF NEW YORK MAY JUSTLY HAVE MERITED THAT HONOUR WHO HAVE SUCCESSFULLY PRACTISED BY THE USE OF MER CURY PERHAPS BEFORE ANY OTHER EITHER IN EUROPE OR AMERICA DURING THE LATE WAR THE SMALL POX WAS BROUGHT INTO DIVERS TOWNS IN THIS AND THE OTHER COLONIES BY THE RETURN OF OUR SOLDIERS EMPLOYED IN HIS MA JESTYS SERVICE IN THE PAY OF THE NEW ENGLAND CO LONIES FOR WINTER QUARTERS AND BY SEAMEN EMPLOYED IN OUR NAVIGATION TO THE BRITISH ISLANDS IN THE WEST INDIES WHERE THE SMALL POX WAS UNIVERSALLY PREVA LENT WHICH PRODUCED AN UNIVERSAL CONCERN AMONG THE INHABITANTS LEST THE SAME SHOULD BECOME GE NERAL AND SPREAD THROUGH THIS AND THE OTHER COLONIES IN NEW ENGLAND WHEREUPON APPLICATION WAS MADE TO THE LEGISLATURE OF THIS COLONY FOR LIBERTY TO INOCU LATE FOR THE SMALLPOX BY THE OFFICERS OF OUR PRO VINCIAL TROOPS AND OTHERS WHICH WAS ACCORDINGLY GRANTED AS LIKEWISE THAT HOSPITALS FOR THAT PURPOSE MIGHT BE ERECTED IN SUCH TOWNS OF THE COLONY AS SHOULD SEE CAUSE TO PERMIT THE SAME HOWEVER INSTEAD OF RE GULATING SUCH HOSPITALS AS SHOULD BE ERECTED FOR THAT PURPOSE BY WELLADAPTED LAWS TO PREVENT ANY COM C C 2 MUNICATION196 MUNICATION WITH THESE HOSPITALS FROM ABROAD OR THE SUBJECTS OF INOCULATION LEAVING THE SAME WITHOUT LICENCE FROM THE ATTENDING PHYSICIAN UNHAPPILY THAT MATTERS WAS LEFT TO BE REGULATED AT THE DISCRETION OF THE OVERSEERS OF THE SEVERAL TOWNS WHERE INOCULATION SHOULD BE PRACTISED WHICH REQUIRED THE STRICTEST LAWS ENFORCED BY SEVERE PENALTIES WITHOUT WHICH IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE ATTENDING PHYSICIAN TO RESTRAIN HIS PATIENTS WHEN GROWN IMPATIENT WITH CONFINE MENT AND A RECLUSE LIFE FROM THIS DEFECT SOME PERSONS LEFT THE HOSPITALS NOT BEING DULY CLEANSED AND UNHAPPILY COMMUNI CATED THE SMALLPOX TO DIVERS PERSONS OF WHICH SOME DIED WHEREUPON THE LAW PERMITTING INOCU LATION WAS REPEALED NOTWITHSTANDING THREE HOSPI TALS HAD BEEN ERECTED IN THIS COLONY AT NO INCONSIDER ABLE EXPENCE AND NO FURTHER ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO REGULATE THE PRACTICE OF INOCULATION BY MEASURES WELL ADAPTED FOR THAT PURPOSE WHEREUPON PERSONS ENGAGED IN TRADE SEAMEN AND YOUTH LIVING IN SEAPORT TOWNS AND PLACES MORE EXPOSED TO FREQUENT INVASIONS OF THE SMALLPOX RE SORTED IN GREAT NUMBERS TO NEW YORK IN ORDER TO OBTAIN INOCULATION ON THIS EMIGRATION OF THE INHABI TANTS AND PARTLY TO PREVENT BUT PRINCIPALLY TO SECURE AGAINST THE SPREADING OF THE CONTAGION IN THE COLONY THE ASSEMBLY PROHIBITED INOCULATION WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THIS COLONY ON VERY SEVERE PENALTIES AND IN CASE PEOPLE WENT INTO ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT TO OBTAIN IT ORDERED THEM NOT TO RETURN AGAIN TO THE CO LONY WITHOUT FIRST HAVING REMAINED OUT AT LEAST TWENTY DAYS AFTER LEAVING THE HOSPITAL OR PLACE OF INFECTION UPON THE PENALTY OF TWENTY POUNDS AND IF197 IF AFTER REMAINING OUT OF THE COLONY TWENTY DAYS THEY SHOULD UNFORTUNATELY HAPPEN EITHER BY THEIR CLOATHS OR OTHERWAYS TO COMMUNICATE THE INFECTION THEY WERE MADE LIABLE TO PAY TO THE PARTY INJURED TREBLE DAMAGES AND COSTS OF SUIT THUS THE PRACTICE OF INOCULATION FOR THE SMALLPOX STANDS WHOLLY INTERDICTED WITHIN THE COLONY AND LAID UNDER SUCH DISADVANTAGES AND DISCOURAGEMENTS WHEN PER SONS GO ABROAD TO PROCURE IT THAT WE ARE IN A GREAT MEASURE DEPRIVED OF THE ONLY METHOD EVER DISCOVERED TO THE WORLD TO ESCAPE THE HAZARDS ATTENDING THAT DISEASE WHICH HAS MADE SUCH HAVOCK OF THE HUMAN SPECIES WAS INOCULATION UPON SOME OF OUR SMALL ISLANDS ON THE SEA COAST OR ON SOME POINT OF LAND AT A PROPER DISTANCE FROM INHABITANTS IMPRACTICABLE WITH SAFETY TO THE INHABITANTS OF THIS COLONY I SHOULD NOT THINK IT UNREASONABLE WHOLLY TO SUPPRESS IT BUT WITHOUT ALL DOUBT IT MAY BE SO REGULATED AS TO BE WHOLLY SAFE AND WITHOUT DANGER OF COMMUNICATION AND THEREFORE I THINK I MAY JUSTLY SAY TO DENY LIBERTY OF INOCULATION TO PERSONS IN TRADE SEAMEN AND SUCH AS ARE MORE IMMEDIATELY EXPOSED TO THE DISEASE OR TO LAY THOSE WHO WOULD GO OUT OF THE COLONY TO OBTAIN IT UNDER SO GREAT DISADVANTAGES IS AN INVA SION OF THE NATURAL RIGHTS OF MANKIND AND AN OB STRUCTION TO THEIR PURSUING THE FIRST LAW OF HUMAN NATURE THE WELLPEOPLING THE COLONIES AND SECURING OUR NEW ACQUISITIONS ARE MATTERS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO OUR MOTHER COUNTRY AS WELL AS TO OURSELVES AND THE MORE IT IS EFFECTED FROM THE COLONIES THEMSELVES WITHOUT TRANSPORTING SETTLERS FROM THE KINGDOMS OF GREAT198 GREATBRITAIN AND IRELAND THE GREATER ADVANTAGES MUST ACCRUE TO THE MANUFACTURERS OF THE MOTHER COUNTRY AS COLONIZING FROM THE PLANTATIONS WILL KEEP THE PRICE OF LABOUR AT SO HIGH A RATE AS WILL EFFECTUALLY PREVENT OUR ENGAGING IN MANUFACTURES AND GREATLY ENCREASE THE SALE OF BRITISH MANUFACTURES IN AME RICA THE NUMBER OF THE INHABITANTS IN OUR OLD AMERICAN SETTLEMENTS DOUBLE ONCE IN TWENTY OR TWENTYFIVE YEARS AND IN OURNEW MADE SETTLEMENTS ONCE IN FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS THE NEW ENGLAND COLONIES ARE BETTER PEOPLED THAN THE OTHER PROVINCES AND COLONIES IN AMERICA WHICH I PRINCIPALLY ATTRIBUTE TO THE TENURE OF OUR LANDS WICH ARE HELD IN FEESIMPLE ACCORDING TO THE TENURE OF THE MANOR OF EAST GREENWICH IN KENT AND I HUMBLY CONCEIVE NOTHING WOULD SO MUCH FACILITATE THE SETTLEMENT OF CROWN LANDS OBTAINED BY OUR NEW ACQUISITIONS IN AMERICA AS THEIR BEING GRANTED IN LIKE MANNER PAYING QUITRENTS TO MONOPOLIZERS OF LARGE TRACTS OF LAND IS NOT WELL RELISHED BY AMERI CANS AND HAS IN ITSELF A NATURAL TENDENCY TO RENDER THE DEFENCE OF THE COUNTRY AGAINST FOREIGN INVADERS AND OUR SAVAGE ENEMIES DESPICABLY INFAMOUS A SIGNAL INSTANCE OF THIS HAPPENED DURING THE FRENCH WAR A D 1745 THE COLONY OF CONNECTICUT HAVING JUST BEFORE FINISHED THE SETTLEMENT OF THEIR NEW LANDS ADJOINING TO THE MANOR OF LIVINGSTON IN THE PROVINCE OF NEW YORK BEING ON THE NORTHWEST FRONTIERS OF THIS COLONY SOME SCULKING PARTIES OF INDIANS BEING SEEN IN THE MANOR AFORESAID THE TENANTS LEFT THEIR SETTLEMENTS WHICH HAD BEEN MADE ALMOST A CENTURY BEFORE AND FLED OVER INTO THIS COUNTRY TO OUR NEWMADE SETTLEMENTS199 SETTLEMENTS WHICH THEN HAD NOT BEEN MADE MORE THAN SEVEN YEARS WHERE THEY LOOKED UPON THEM SELVES AS SAFE AND SECURE A CONVINCING PROOF THAT NO MEN WILL FACE AN ENEMY LIKE THOSE WHO FIGHT PRO ARIS ET FOCIS OUR SOUTHERN COLONIES IN PARTICULAR HAVE BEEN DROVE BEFORE A DESPICABLE ENEMY LIKE SHEEP THIS NEVER WAS THE CASE EVEN IN THE INFANT STATE OF THESE COLONIES THE CENSUS OF THE INHABITANTS OF THIS COLONY TRANSMITTED BY GOVERNOR FITCH A D 1756 BY ORDER OF THE LORDS OF TRADE WAS 128218 SOULS WHITES AND 3587 BLACKS THAT OF THE YEAR 1762 141000 SOULS WHITES 4590 BLACKS OF WHICH 930 WERE INDIANS THE LEVIES OF OUR FENCIBLE MEN DIMINISHED THE INCREASE SO THAT THE LAST SEVEN YEARS THE COLONY ONLY INCREASED 13000 ON THE PEACE DOUBTLESS THE RAPIDITY OF POPULATION WILL RECOVER AND IN HOW SHORT A SPACE OF TIME THE WELL SETTLING OUR NEW AC QUISITIONS MAY BE EFFECTED FROM ALL THE AMERICAN COLONIES COLLECTIVELY I LEAVE EVERY ONE TO DETERMINE AND I CANNOT BUT THINK THAT WHENEVER THE STATE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS WILL PERMIT THE PARLIAMENT OF GREAT BRITAIN TO ADVERT TO THE PEOPLING AND SECURING THE ACQUISITIONS MADE IN AMERICA THEY WILL JUDGE IT BEST EFFECTED AS MUCH AS MAY BE FROM HER COLONIES IN AMERICA AND THAT THE LAW PROHIBITING INOCULA TION IN AMERICA WILL BE ACCORDINGLY ANNULLED BY THEIR SUPERINTENDING AUTHORITY AS PREJUDICAL TO THE POPULATION OF THE COLONIES IT APPEARS FROM DR DOUGLASSS ACCOUNT OF THE SMALLPOX IN THE TOWN OF BOSTON WHERE HE LIVED AND MADE CRITICAL OBSERVATIONS THE THREE LAST TIMES THAT IT WAS EPIDEMICAL THERE VIZ A D 1721 1730 AND200 AND 1752 THAT THE NUMBER OF PERSONS VISITED WITH THE SMALLPOX IN THE NATURAL WAY WAS 16047 OF WHICH 1858 DIED AND THAT IN 1752 THE NUMBER OF THOSE WHO RECEIVED THE INFECTION BY INOCULATION BEFORE MER CURY WAS MADE USE OF IN BOSTON IN INOCULATION AMOUNT ED TO 2113 PERSONS OF WHICH 30 DIED BLACKS IN BOTH BEING INCLUDED GRANTING THAT THOSE WHO HAD THE DISEASE IN THE NATURAL WAY STOOD AN EQUAL CHANCE FOR LIFE WITH THOSE WHO WERE INOCULATED IT APPEARS THAT IN THOSE THREE YEARS THERE DIED 1831 IN THE TOWN OF BOSTON ONLY FOR WANT OF INOCULATION BY WHICH DEATHS ACCORDING TO THE LONGEST TERM OF DOUBLING THE NUMBER OF INHABITANTS IN AMERICA IN ONE CEN TURY FROM THOSE PERIODS THE NUMBER WILL BE DIMI NISHED BY 29296 WHICH IS FROM THE BEST CALCULATION I AM ABLE TO MAKE A NUMBER FAR SUPERIOR TO THOSE WHO CAME FROM EUROPE INTO THE NEW ENGLAND CO LONIES FROM THEIR FIRST SETTLEMENT TO THIS PRESENT DAY VARIOUS SEAPORT TOWNS AS WELL AS SOME INLAND PLACES HAVE BEEN VISITED WITH THE SMALLPOX SINCE THE FIRST SETTLEMENT OF THE NEW ENGLAND COLONIES BY WHICH MANY HAVE DIED PERHAPS TAKEN COLLECTIVELY NOT MORE THAN ONE IN FOUR HAVE RECOVERED PARTLY OWING TO REMOVING THE SICK IN ORDER TO PREVENT COM MUNICATING THE INFECTION AND PARTLY TO THE WANT OF SKILFUL PHYSICIANS AND FAITHFUL EXPERIENCED NURSES TO ATTEND THE SICK WHICH OFTEN OBLIGED TO MAKE USE OF SOME OF THE MOST ABANDONED WRETCHES FOR WANT OF SUITABLE PERSONS WHO HAD HAD THE SMALLPOX TO PER FORM THAT SERVICE IT IS MUCH REGRETTED BY MANY THAT THE PRACTICE OF INOCULATION MAY NOT BE TOLERATED IN THE NEW ENGLAND COLONIES AND REGULATED BY LAWS WELL ADAPTED 4 TO201 TO PREVENT THE SPREADING THE CONTAGION AMONGST SUCH AS DO NOT CHUSE AND THOSE WHOSE CIRCUMSTANCES WILL NOT PERMIT THEM TO COMPLY WITH THE EXPENCE AT TENDING IT THE INCREASE OF MANKIND HAS BEEN MORE IMPEDED BY THE SMALLPOX THAN IS USUALLY IMAGINED IT IS NOT THE LOSS OF ONE IN SIX OR EIGHT WHO DIE WITH THE DISEASE THAT IS CHIEFLY TO BE ATTENDED TO BUT THE AC CUMULATED LOSS OF ALL THE POSTERITY WHICH MIGHT HAVE DESCENDED FROM THEM MULTIPLIED THROUGH ALL SUCCEED ING GENERATIONS WHEREFORE PERHAPS IT MIGHT BE THOUGHT WISDOM TO ADDRESS THE THRONE FOR LIBERTY TO ERECT ONE HOSPITAL IN EACH OF THE NEW ENGLAND COLO NIES FOR THAT PURPOSE THAT THOSE AT LEAST WHO ARE EN GAGED IN TRADE AND NAVIGATION MIGHT HAVE THE BENEFIT OF INOCULATION AND BE EXEMPT FROM THE HAZARD OF THE DISEASE WHILE NECESSARILY ENGAGED IN BUSINESS ABROAD AND NOT ENDANGER THEIR FRIENDS ON THEIR RETURN HOME I BLEEDING AT THE FIRST INVASION OF THE ERUPTIVE FE VER MUST BE ADVANTAGEOUS WHEN THE BLOOD IS RICH AND DENSE THE COHESION OF THE COMPO NENT PARTS STRONG THE PATIENT PLETHORIC AND THE FEVER INFLAMMATORY II BLEEDING MUST BE PREJUDICIAL IF THE QUANTITY OF BLOOD IS BELOW THE STANDARD OF HEALTH AND SEROUS THE COHESION OF THE CONSTITUENT COMPO NENT PARTS WEAK AND THE FEVER LOW AND DEPRESSED III BLEEDING WILL NOT ALTER THE STATE OF THE BLOOD AND RESTORE THE COHESION OF ITS CONSTITUENT COMPONENT PARTS WHEN BROKEN AND DISSOLVED CONSEQUENTLY IT WILL BE OF NO SERVICE WHEN AT V O L LV D D TENDED202 TENDED WITH HEMORRHAGES UNLESS THE PATIENT BE PLETHORIC AND THE HEMORRHAGES PRODUCED BY AN INJUDICIOUS INTEMPESTIVE USE OF HOT ALEXIPHARMIC MEDICINES  IV BLEEDING IN THE SMALLPOX WILL NOT BE ATTENDED WITH SUCCESS WHEN IT WOULD NOT BE OF AD VANTAGE IN THE SAME SPECIES OF FEVER IN ANY OTHER DISEASE V MERCURIALS ALONE ARE NOT TO BE RELIED ON IN ORDER TO LESSEN THE NUMBER OF PUSTULES BUT MUST BE PREJUDICIAL WHEN THE BLOOD IS FEROUS ITS TEXTURE WEAK OR THE DISSOLUTION OF ITS CONSTITUENT COMPONENT PARTS COMPLEAT A SUMMARY OF THE SEVERAL METHODS USED BY THE MOST REPUTABLE INOCULATORS IN AMERICA 1 METHOD THE SUBJECTS FOR INOCULATION

AFFECTED IN WHICH CASE THEY ARE TO BE DISCONTINUED AND UPON THE INVASION OF THE ERUPTIVE FEVER THE GENERAL ANTIPHLOGISTIC METHOD IS PURSUED THE THIRD AND LAST METHOD I SHALL MENTION IS TAKEN FROM A VERY FAMOUS ALTHOUGH I DARE NOT SAY THE MOST JUDICIOUS INOCULATOR AND IS COMMONLY D D 2 ENTERED204 ENTERED UPON AND THE OPERATION PERFORMED WITHOUT ANY REGIMEN BEING PREVIOUSLY ENJOINED AND OFTEN AFTER FREE INDULGENCE THIS RASH INOCULATOR PRESCRIBES TO ADULTS FROM 10 TO 20 GRAINS OF CALOMEL IN AN ANODYNE BOLUS OVER NIGHT THE NEXT MORNING HE EXHI BITS FROM 30 TO 40 GRAINS OF PULV CORNACHIN AND THE DAY FOLLOWING HE INOCULATES IN THE USUAL FORM THE CALOMEL BOLUS IS PRESCRIBED EVERY OTHER NIGHT AND THE NEXT MORNING THE PULV CORNACHIN UNTIL FOUR DOSES OF EACH ARE ADMINISTERED EVERY OTHER NIGHT

RUNS HIGH BLEED ING IS REPEATED PRO RE NATA THIS METHOD SUCCEEDS WELL WITH THE ROBUST WHOSE FIBRES ARE LIKE THOSE OF BEHEMOTH AND WHOSE NERVES ARE LIKE BRASS BUT I HAVE KNOWN OTHERS WHO BEING OF A MORE DELICATE MAKE AND THEIR BLOOD OF A LOOSE TEXTURE FELL A SACRIFICE TO THIS METHOD AND OTHERS WHOSE CONSTITUTION WAS RUINED BY SUCH AN INDISCRIMI NATE AND INJUDICIOUS USE OF MERCURY DRASTIC PURGES AND THE LANCET IT MAY BE THOUGHT UNNECESSARY TO INSERT MY OWN PARTICULAR METHOD MORE ESPECIALLY AS I HAD OPPOR TUNITY TO INOCULATE NO MORE THAN 70 OR 80 PERSONS BEFORE THE PRACTICE OF INOCULATION WAS

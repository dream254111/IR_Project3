not so much the lack of material as the difficulty of obtaining access to that already in existence that is the greatest obstacle in the way of accurate and satisfactory studies of actual economic conditions and institutions Here as in few other fields of research the ordinary library can be utilized to little advantage One can find there what has already been written upon a subject but for purposes of strictly original research it is scarcely worth a visit The class of material that should be consulted either is not there at all or if possessed is of such a nature as to defy ordinary cataloguing methods This material consists of government reports relating to questions of industry and labor proceedings of labor and social congresses and conventions the constitutions and reports of private organizations and institutions such as tradeunions cooperative societies mutual aid funds etc the files of economic and statistical periodicals the published pro ceedings of statistical and other kindred societies which include the results of original research etc The readers of the ANNALS cannot fail to be interested in a brief description of the Musie Social an institution recently organized in Paris which is without doubt the most remarkable effort that has been made to supply this deficiency on the part of ordinary libraries and to render available the real sources of information concerning economic conditions and institutions The Musie owes its creation directly to the organization of sections of social economy in connection with recent international exposi tions The first exposition which had such a section was that of 1867 at Paris Le Play the eminent economist was directed on that occasion to organize a section to embrace all documents on subjects relating to efforts to ameliorate the physical and moral condition of of the population  The central feature of this section was the crea tion of the famous New Order of Recompenses Nouvel Ordre de Recompenses in favor of persons or establishments or localities which by the organization of special institutions had developed the 58THZ MUSfE SOCIAL IN PARIS feeling of harmony among all those who cooperate in the work of pro duction and had assured to the workingmen material moral and intellectual advantages  This exposition in which over six hundred of the most important industrial establishments of the world took part is recognized throughout France to constitute the point of departure in the history of the modern study of social conditions At the exposition of Paris in 1889 the scope of the section of social economy was still further enlarged At this exposition there was assembled a vast quantity of documents of an original character such as the constitutions of societies the reports of operations of workingmens institutions models of workingmens houses statis tics of old age pension and relief funds exhibits of cooperative societies proceedings of congresses etc All of this material has been digested and presented in a magnificent series of reports each relating to a particular subject than which it is safe to say there is no more valuable series of documents concerning social problems in the world It was to perpetuate this work to prevent the dispersion of these valuable documents and exhibits and to render permanent what was until then an occasional exhibition that the Count de Cham brun by his generous donation of over I700000 francs created the Musle Social The Mushe was not formerly inaugurated until March 25 1895 though organized prior to that date The Mushe Social then is a privately endowed but public institution whose object in the language of its constitution is to place gratuitously at the dis position of the public documents with collateral information models  Exposition Universelle de 1867 c Paris Jury Special Nouvel Ordre de Recom penses Rapport par M Alfred Le Roux Paris i867 tExposition Universelle Internationale de 1889  Paris

plans etc of institutions and organizations which have for their object and result the amelioration of the moral and material situation of the laboring classes  To carry out these aims the management of the Muste has decided upon the following lines of action First the collection of a library to contain r files as nearly complete as possible of all government publications relating in any way to industry and labor of every country such as copies of laws relating to labor reports of parlia mentary or other official investigations reports of bureaus of statistics inspectors of mines and factories boards of arbitration etc 2 reports of labor organizations especially the meetings of national associations of cooperative enterprises relief funds etc  3 reports of proceedings of conventions and congresses in relation to social ques tions 4 files of the publications of economic and statistical asso ciations and of economic and statistical periodicals and reviews and 5 the more important books in all languages relating to labor and social questions in their practical aspects Secondly the Musle is more than a library It is a laboratory in the broadest sense of the word At its central quarters it has all of its material carefully arranged according to subjectmatter But as any system of cataloguing is not entirely satisfactory the work of the Muske has been organized in sections at the head of each of which is a specialist whose duties are to familiarize himself with not only the material in the possession of the Musee but with the whole literature of his subject in order that he can personally assist any one desiring to make use of the facilities of the MAusee Every facility for research is also provided in the way of private desk room stationery etc as the library is devised not so much for casual consultation as for those desiring to make prolonged and detailed investigations The officials moreover are always at the disposition of the public for the answering of communications ask ing assistance and advice concerning the mode of organization of any institution or work Thirdly the MIuse will from time to time as the occasion seems propitious organize special missions in France and in foreign coun tries to inquire into labor subjects of present practical importance In the autumn of I895 two such missions were organized The first was composed of four persons who under the supervision of M Paul de Rousiers the author of La Question ouvriere en Angleterre visited England for the purpose of making an investigation and report upon tradeunions The second mission at the head of which was Professor G Blondel had for its object the study of the agrarian question in GermanyTHE MusfS SOCIAL IN PARIS with especial reference to agrarian socialism and the efforts of the government to improve the condition of the agricultural classes These investigations are by no means mere cursory examinations in order to gain personal impressions but represent detailed inquiries such as would be undertaken by an official bureau Thus for example in the case of the latter mission which represents an investigation of a problem of great interest at the present time in Germany the Commission first visited the valleys of the Inn and Danube in order to study peasant associations and conditions in lower Bavaria Westphalia and Hanover were next visited in order to observe the intimate life of the peasants in that part of Germany which more than any other has preserved the old Saxon customs and where the fact that the conveyance of property is still influenced by ancient traditions assures to the inhabitants a situa tion superior to that of their neighbors The study of small properties being completed the Commission then visited the region of large estates situated west of the Oder Here the organization of the large Silesian domains and the attempts made by the Prussian Government to reconstitute by means of the Reten Giier a middle class among the peasants of the East were objects of espe cially careful investigation a work in which the Commission was greatlyaided by the assistance of the Minister of Agriculture at Berlin Next the Commission thanks to the assistance of the Presi dent of the Commission for the Colonization of Interior Germany visited and were able to study in detail the villages created by the Prussian Government in the effort to transfer to the peasants the lands formerly belonging to the Polish nobility Throughout this investigation every effort was made to come into immediate contact with the peasants themselves to observe upon the spot the operations of the various institutions which play so important a part in the life of the people to study the effect of the system of insurance laws upon the agricultural population the workings of agricultural credit associations etc The activity of the Muse outside of France however has not been limited to the organization of these two missions Following the policy of being represented at all the more important labor and social congresses and conventions the Muse has been officially represented at the International Cooperative Congress of London the Statistical Congress at Berne the Congress of Actuaries at Brussels the Congress of Peoples Banks at Bologne the Congress in Relation to Workingmens Houses at Bordeaux the TradeUnion Congress at Cardiff the Socialist Congress at Breslau and the Na tional Congress of Corporations at Limoges62 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY Fourthly the Muske will issue two series of publications for the purpose of making known to the public the more important results of its work The first of these will consist of a series of volumes issued from time to time under the title of Bibliotheque du Muske Social which will give the results of its missions and other material representing the results of original research The second series will consist of more frequent bulletins or  Circulaires as they will be called for the publication of material of a strictly documentary character It will be in no sense a review for contributed articles The chief features of its contents will be yearly bibliographical notes concerning economic publications official or otherwise and resumes of social legislation in each country written by its special correspon dents special bibliographical notes concerning particular subjects notices regarding conventions congresses etc and reprints of important laws or other documents Finally the Muske will adopt every other available method for the advancement of the study of social and economic conditions Among these will be the holding of conferences and the offering of money prizes for the best work on assigned subjects Two such competitions have already been opened one on The Benefits of the Principles of Association for the Workingmen  and the other on Profit Sharing the prize in each case being 5000 for the best work The contest is open to all competitors whatever the nation ality or language used The Muske then is in its nature a central bureau of information or a kind of international bureau of labor It should be distinctly understood that the field of the Muses activity is by no means limited to France On the other hand it believes that the field of its greatest usefulness will be the making known to each nation the institutions publications and experiences of other countries The better to do this the Muske has appointed a special correspondent for each country for in no other way could it hope to keep in touch with social movements in each or to obtain official and other publi cations that should be in its possession Concerning the usefulness of this institution the writer has already had a practical demonstration Though the Muske was at that time but in the process of organization he found the assist ance of those at its head invaluable to him in the prosecution of an official investigation that he was making in the fall of I894 for the United States Department of Labor in France and other European countries There were placed at his disposal documents that he could not have obtained elsewhere authorities and sources of infor mation were indicated to him and above all he was aided byTHE HISTORY OF A MUNICIPAL CHARTER practical advice concerning the methods by which the information for which he was in search could best be obtained W F WILLOUGHBY Special Correspondent of the Musee Social in America THE HISTORY OF A MUNICIPAL CHARTER IN KENTUCKY In I89o the Constitutional Conventon after a session of eight months and considerable outside agitation submitted the results of its labors to the people who adopted the new Constitution by a large majority At an adjourned session which lasted nearly four weeks the Convention made some slight alterations of form The Consti tution was then formally promulgated One of the longest articles is devoted to the regulation of municipalities Towns and cities are divided into six classes Cities having over one hundred thousand inhabitants are not permitted to maintain a taxrate for purposes exceeding one dollar and fifty cents on the hundred dollars In this the tax for schools and sinking funds is not included In otherwords a special and additional tax for educational purposes and for paying off debts existing before I89I may be imposed The present tax for school purposes in the city is thirtythree cents on the hundred dol lars and the sinking fund tax varies from forty to eighty cents Hence until the bonded debt of the city has been discharged these Constitutional limitations will be of little value No new debt can be created or liability incurred by the city in any manner or for any purpose to any amount exceeding in any year the income and revenue provided for such year without the assent of twothirds of the voters thereof voting at an election to be held for that purpose  Only one election may be held during any one year for any purpose and that must be in November Whenever any new debt is created a provision must be made at the same time for a tax to pay the interest and a part of the principal each year Last year it was proposed to increase the bonded debt by one million dollars for park purposes The proposal received a majority of twothirds of the votes cast on that subject but not twothirds of all the votes cast in the same election for certain officers and now the courts must decide whether the votes cast for the bonds were sufficient Excepting members of the two boards constituting the General Council nearly all important officers including the Mayor Police Judge Treasurer Tax Receiver etc are elected for four years The address of the AMuske is 5 rue

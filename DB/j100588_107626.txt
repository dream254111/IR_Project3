J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107626,ON THE NERVES GIVING AN ACCOUNT OF SOME EXPERIMENTS ON THEIR STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONS WHICH LEAD TO A NEW ARRANGEMENT OF THE SYSTEM,I206976,C 398 J XXVIII ON THE JVERVES GIVING AN ACCOUNT OF SOME EXPERI MENTS ON THEIR STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONS WHICH LEAD TO A NEW ARRANGEMENT OF THE SYSTEM BY CHARLES BELL ESQ COM MUNICATED BY SIR HUMPHRY DAVY BART P R S READ JULY 12 1821 DURING THE GENERAL ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE WHICH HAS LATELY TAKEN PLACE IN THIS COUNTRY OBSERVATIONS HAVE BEEN GRADUALLY ACCUMULATING IN THE SCHOOLS OF THE METROPOLIS WHICH PROVE THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF ANATOMY HAS NOT BEEN STATIONARY THE NERVOUS SYSTEM HITHERTO THE MOST UNSATISFACTORY PART OF A PHYSIOLOGISTS STUDIES LLAS ASSUMED A NEW CHARACTER THE INTRICACIES OF THAT SYSTEM HAVE BEEN UNRAVELLED AND THE PE CULIAR STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONS OF THE INDIVIDUAL NERVES ASCER TAINED SO THAT THE ABSOLUTE CONFUSION IN WHICH THIS DEPART MENT WAS INVOLVED HAS DISAPPEARED AND THE NATURAL AND SIMPLE ORDER HAS BEEN DISCOVERED IN PROCEEDING TO GIVE SOME ACCOUNT OF THESE NEW OBSER VATIONS THE AUTHOR OF THIS PAPER HAD CONCEIVED THAT IT WOULD BE MORE SUITABLE TO THE SCIENTIFIC BODY HE HAD TO ADDRESS TO LAY THE SUBJECT BEFORE THEM IN THE PRECISE MANNER IN WHICH IT FIRST PRESENTED ITSELF TO HIS ENQUIRIES AND TO DETAIL HIS OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS IN THE SUCCESSION IN WHICH THEY WERE MADE BUT HE HAS BEEN PERSUADED BY SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF THIS SOCIETY TO CHANGE THAT FORM AND TO PRESENT THE SUBJECT IN THE MANNER TO WHICH HE HAS BEENMR BELLS EXPERIMENTS ON THE STRUCTURE C ACCUSTOMED IN TEACHING THESE DOCTRINES AND THEY WERE PLEASED TO SAY THAT IN THIS WAY A NEW SUBJECT WOULD BE MORE READILY COMPREHENDED INTRICACY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM ANATOMISTS HAVE OF LATE NOT ONLY IN THIS COUNTRY BUT ALSO IN GERMANY AND ITALY MADE GREAT IMPROVEMENT IN THE MINUTE DISSECTION AND DISPLAY OF THE NERVES BUT WHILST THE DOCTRINES HITHERTO RECEIVED PREVAIL THE DISCOVERY OF NEW BRANCHES OF NERVES AND NEW GANGLIA ONLY INVOLVE THE SUBJECT IN DEEPER OBSCURITY WHILST THE NERVES ARE SUPPOSED TO PROCEED FROM ONE GREAT CENTRE TO HAVE THE SAME STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONS AND TO BE ALL SENSIBLE AND ALL OF THEM TO CONVEY WHAT HAS BEEN VAGUELY CALLED NERVOUS POWER THESE DISCOVERIES OF NEW NERVES AND GANGLIA ARE WORSE THAN USELESS THEY INCREASE THE INTRICACY AND REPEL ENQUIRY THE ENDLESS CONFUSION OF THE SUBJECT INDUCES THE PHYSICIAN INSTEAD OF TAKING THE NER VOUS SYSTEM AS THE SECURE GROUND OF HIS PRACTICE TO DISMISS IT FROM HIS COURSE OF STUDY AS A SUBJECT PRESENTING TOO GREAT IRREGULARITY FOR LEGITIMATE INVESTIGATION OR RELIANCE WHEN THE PHYSIOLOGIST SEES TWO DISTINCT NERVES SPREADING THEIR BRANCHES TO EVERY PART OF THE FACE AS IN PI XXX THREE NERVES FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES GIVEN TO THE TONGUE FOUR TO THE THROAT AND NERVES IN MOST PERPLEXING INTRICACY TO THE NECK WHEN HE FINDS ONE NERVE WITH NUMEROUS GANGLIA OR KNOTS UPON IT AND ANOTHER WITHOUT THEM WHEN IN SHORT AFTER A MINUTE DISSECTION OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM HE FINDS A MESH OR NETWORK SPREADING EVERYWHERE IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT THE SEEMING INTRICACY AND CONFUSION SHOULD MAKE HIM IN DESPAIR RESIGN ENQUIRY BUT THE AUTHOR OF THIS PAPER BEING FORCED IN THE 399MR BELLS EXPERIMENTS ON THE STRUCTURE COURSE OF HIS DUTY TO GO MINUTELY OVER THE DEMONSTRATION OF THE NERVES YEAR AFTER YEAR WITHOUT ALLOWING HIMSELF TO RESIGN THE SUBJECT MERELY ON ACCOUNT OF ITS INTRICACY AND FINDING THE FACTS WHICH HE HAD TO EXPLAIN IN HIS DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE ANATOMY QUITE INCONSISTENT WITH THE RECEIVED OPINIONS HE GRADUALLY AFTER MUCH STUDY WAS ENABLED TO DECYPHER AND TO READ THAT LANGUAGE OF WHICH THE CHARACTER HAD HITHERTO BEEN IMPERFECTLY KNOVWN AND NOW EVEN THE YOUNGEST STUDENTS ARE BROUGHT TO COMPREHEND SO MUCH OF THE SUBJECT THAT THE IDEA OF CHANCE OR ACCIDENT OR REAL CONFUSION AMONG THESE NU MEROUS BRANCHES IS ENTIRELY DISMISSED AND WHAT REMAINS UNEXPLAINED HAS BY THE SUCCESS OF OUR PAST ENQUIRIES BECOME A SUBJECT OF PECULIAR INTEREST FROM THE CONVICTION THAT ATTENTION TO THE MINUTE ANATOMY UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF CAUTIOUS AND FAIR INDUCTION WILL SOONER OR LATER LEAD TO A COMPREHENSION OF THE WHOLE SYSTEM STATEMENT OF THE OBJECT OF THE PAPER THE AUTHOR MEANS TO LIMIT HIS PRESENT ENQUIRY TO THE NERVES OF RESPIRATION BUT ACCORDING TO HIS CONCEPTION OF THIS MATTER THESE NERVES FORM A SYSTEM OF GREAT EXTENT COMPREHENDING ALL THE NERVES WHICH SERVE TO COMBINE THE MUSCLES EMPLOYED IN THE ACT OF BREATHING AND SPEAKING THE FIRST POINT OF ENQUIRY NATURALLY IS HOW MANY OF THE MUSCLES ARE COMBINED IN THE ACT OF RESPIRATION  AND THE SECOND QUESTION BY WHAT MEANS ARE THESE MUSCLES WHICH ARE SEATED APART FROM EACH OTHER AND MANY OF THEM CAPABLE OF PERFORMING DISTINCT OFFICES COMBINED TOGETHER IN RESPIRATION  IT MAY SOUND ODDLY TO SPEAK OF THE RESPIRATORY NERVE OF THE FACE OF THE NECK AND OF THE SHOULDER AND IT MAY BE NECES 400AND FNCTIONSF F THE NERVES SARY TO GIVE AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE SENSE IN WHICH THE TERM IS INTENDED TO BE EMPLOYED WHEN A POSTHORSE HAS RUN ITS STAGE AND THE CIRCULATION IS HURRIED AND THE RESPIRATION EX CITED WHAT IS HIS CONDITION  DOES HE BREATHE WITH HIS RIBS ONLY WITH THE MUSCLES WHICH RAISE AND DEPRESS THE CHEST NO THE FLANKS ARE IN VIOLENT ACTION  THE NECK AS WELL AS THE CHEST IS IN POWERFUL EXCITEMENT THE NOSTRILS AS WELL AS THE THROAT KEEP TIME WITH THE MOTION OF THE CHEST SO IF A MAN BE EXCITED BY EXERCISE OR PASSION OR BY WHATEVER ACCE LERATES THE PULSE THE RESPIRATORY ACTION IS EXTENDED AND EN CREASED AND INSTEAD OF THE GENTLE AND SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE MOTION OF THE CHEST AS IN COMMON BREATHING THE SHOUL DERS ARE RAISED AT EACH INSPIRATION THE MUSCLES OF THE THROAT AND NECK ARE VIOLENTLY DRAWN AND THE LIPS AND NOSTRILS MOVE IN TIME WITH THE GENERAL ACTION AND IF HE DOES NOT BREATHE THROUGH THE MOUTH THE NOSTRILS EXPAND AND FALL IN TIME WITH THE RISING AND FALLING OF THE CHEST AND THAT APPARATUS OF CARTILAGES AND MUSCLES OF THE NOSE WHICH ARE AS CURIOUS AS THE MECHANISM OF THE CHEST AND WHICH ARE FOR EXPANDING THESE AIR TUBES ARE AS REGULARLY IN ACTION AS THE LEVATOR AND DEPRESSOR MUSCLES OF THE RIBS IT IS QUITE OBVIOUS THAT SOME HUNDRED MUSCLES THUS EM PLOYED IN THE ACT OF BREATHING OR IN THE COMMON ACTIONS OF COUGHING SNEEZING SPEAKING AND SINGING CANNOT BE ASSOCI ATED WITHOUT CORDS OF CONNECTION OR AFFINITY WHICH COMBINE THEM IN THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE ACTIONS THE NERVES WHICH SERVE THIS PURPOSE I CALL RESPIRATORY NERVES 401MR BELLS EXPERIMENTS ON THE STRUCTURE THE NERVES OF THE ANIMAL FRAME ARE COMPLEX IN PROPORTION TO THE VARIETY OF FUNCTIONS WHICH THE PARTS HAVE TO MAINTAIN WHEN WE MINUTELY AND CAREFULLY EXAMINE THE NERVES OF THE HUMAN BODY AND COMPARE THEM WITH THOSE OF OTHER ANIMALS A VERY SINGULAR COINCIDENCE IS OBSERVED BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF ORGANS THE COMPOUND NATURE OF THEIR FUNCTIONS AND THE NUMBER OF NERVES WHICH ARE TRANSMITTED TO THEM NO ORGAN WHICH POSSESSES ONLY ONE PROPERTY OR ENDOWMENT HAS MORE THAN ONE NERVE HOWEVER EXQUISITE THE SENSE OR ACTION MAY BE BUT IF TWO NERVES COMING FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES ARE DIRECTED TO ONE PART THIS IS THE SIGN OF A DOUBLE FUNCTION PER FORMED BY IT IF A PART OR ORGAN HAVE MANY DISTINCT NERVES WE MAY BE CERTAIN THAT INSTEAD OF HAVING A MERE ACCUMULATION OF NERVOUS POWER IT POSSESSES DISTINCT POWERS OR ENTERS INTO DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS IN PROPORTION TO THE NUMBER OF ITS NERVES THE KNOWLEDGE OF THIS CIRCUMSTANCE GIVES NEW INTEREST TO THE INVESTIGATION OF THIS PART OF ANATOMY THUS IN REVIEWING THE COMPARATIVE ANATOMY OF THE NERVES OF THE MOUTH WE SHALL FIND THAT IN CREATURES WHICH DO NOT BREATHE THE MOUTH HAVING ONLY OTE FUNCTION TO PERFORM ONE NERVE IS SUFFICIENT IN CERTAIN ANIMALS WHERE THE FACE AND NOSTRILS HAVE NO COMPLEXITY OF RELATIONS THESE PARTS HAVE ONLY A SINGLE NERVE IF THE THROAT HAS NO COMPLEXITY OF ORGANI ZATION IT HAS NO VARIETY OF NERVES BUT ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN THE ANATOMIST EMPLOYS WEEKS TO DISSECT AND DISENTANGLE THE NERVES OF THE TONGUE THROAT AND PALATE IN THE HUMAN SUBJECT HE FINDS AT LENGTH THAT HE HAS EXHIBITED THE BRANCHES OF FIVE DIFFERENT TRUNKS OF NERVES AND THERE IS NO CLUE TO THE LABYRINTH UNTIL HE CONSIDERS THE MULTIPLIED OFFICES OF THE MOUTH 402ANDFUNCTIONS OF THE NERVES IN MAN THAT IT IS A PNEUMATIC AS MUCH AS A MANDUCATORY ORGAN THAT IT IS THE ORGAN OF THE VOICE AND OF SPEECH AS OF TASTE AND EXQUISITE FEELING IT WOULD INDEED BE MATTER OF SUR PRISE IF THE SAME NERVE SERVED FOR THE ACTION OF GNAWING AND FEEDING IN THE LOWER ANIMALS OF SIMPLE STRUCTURE AND ALSO FOR THE GOVERNANCE OF THOSE COMPLICATED OPERATIONS WHICH SERVE TO INTERPRET THE WANTS AND SENTIMENTS OF MAN SUCH ARE THE VIEWS WHICH NATURALLY ARISE FROM AN ACQUAINT ANCE WITH THE NERVES OF THE HUMAN BODY BUT A COMPARISON OF THEM WITH THOSE OF THE LOWER CLASSES OF ANIMALS ENABLES US TO ESTABLISH A MORE LUCID ORDER AND THAT NOT IN AN ARBITRARY MANNER BUT PERFECTLY ACCORDING TO NATURE THE NERVES OF ALL CREATURES MAY BE DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS OR SYSTEMS THE ONE SIMPLE AND UNIFORM THE OTHER IRREGULAR AND COMPLEX IN PROPORTION TO THE COMPLEXITY OF ORGANIZATION WHEN THE NERVES OF THE FACE MOUTH THROAT AND NECK OF THE HUMAN SUBJECT ARE MINUTELY DISPLAYED IT SEEMS IMPRACTI CABLE TO REDUCE THE NUMEROUS NERVES WHICH CROSS AND ENTWINE WITH EACH OTHER TO TWO DISTINCT CLASSES YET NOTHING IS MORE CERTAIN THAN THAT THIS MAY BE DONE AND BY AN EASY AND NATURAL METHOD THE PRINCIPLE WHICH IS TO GUIDE US IS OBTAINED BY ASCERTAIN ING WHAT PARTS OF THE ORGANIZATION OF AN ANIMAL ARE NECESSARY TO LIFE AND MOTION WHAT ORGANS ARE SUPERADDED AS THE ANIMAL ADVANCES IN THE SCALE OF EXISTENCE AS NECESSARY TO HIGHER AND MORE COMPLEX ENJOYMENTS AND ACTIONS WHERE AN ANIMAL IS ENDOWED WITH MERE SENSATION AND LOCO MOTION WHERE THERE IS NO CENTRAL ORGAN OF CIRCULATION AND NO ORGAN OF RESPIRATION BUT WHAT IS GENERALLY DIFFUSED OVER THE MDCCCXXI F 4O3404 MR BELLS EXPERIMENTS ON THE STRUCTURE FRAME THE NERVES ARE EXTREMELY SIMPLE THEY CONSIST OF TWO CORDS RUNNING IN THE LENGTH OF THE BODY WITH BRANCHES GOING OFF LATERALLY TO THE SEVERAL DIVISIONS OF THE FRAME AND HERE NO INTRICACY IS TO BE SEEN NO DOUBLE SUPPLY OF NERVES IS TO BE OBSERVED BUT EACH PORTION OF THE FRAME HAS AN EQUAL SUPPLY AND THE CENTRAL LINE OF CONNECTION IS SUFFICIENT TO COMBINE THE ACTIONS OF THE MUSCLES AND TO GIVE THEM THE CONCATENATION NECESSARY TO LOCOMOTION THERE IS THE SAME UNIFORM AND SYMMETRICAL SYSTEM OF NERVES IN THE HUMAN BODY AS IN THE LEECH OR WORM  ALTHOUGH OBSCURED BY A VARIETY OF SUPERADDED NERVES THESE ADDITIONAL NERVES BELONG TO ORGANS WHICH TRACING THE ORDERS OF ANIMALS UPWARD ARE OBSERVED GRADUALLY TO ACCUMULATE UNTIL WE ARRIVE AT THE COMPLICATION OF THE HUMAN FRAME THESE NERVES ADDITIONAL AND SUPERADDED TO THE ORIGINAL SYSTEM DO NOT DESTROY BUT ONLY OBSCURE THAT SYSTEM AND ACCORDINGLY WHEN WE SEPARATE CER TAIN NERVES THE ORIGINAL SYSTEM OF SIMPLE CONSTITUTION IS PRE SENTED EVEN IN THE HUMAN BODY THE NERVES OF THE SPINE THE TENTH OR SUBOCCIPITAL NERVE AND THE FIFTH OR TRIGEMINUS OF THE SYSTEM OF WILLIS CONSTITUTE THIS ORIGINAL AND SYMMETRICAL SYSTEM ALL THESE NERVES AGREE IN THESE ESSENTIAL CIRCUMSTANCES THEY HAVE ALL DOUBLE ORIGINS THEY HAVE ALL GANGLIA ON ONE OF THEIR ROOTS THEY GO OUT LATE RALLY TO CERTAIN DIVISIONS OF THE BODY THEY DO NOT INTERFERE TO UNITE THE DIVISIONS OF THE FRAME THEY ARE ALL MUSCULAR NERVES ORDERING THE VOLUNTARY MOTIONS OF THE FRAME THEY ARE ALL EXQUISITELY SENSIBLE  AND THE SOURCE OF THE COMMON SENSIBILITY OF THE SURFACES OF THE BODY WHEN ACCURATELY REPRESENTED ON PAPER THEY ARE SEEN TO PERVADE EVERY PART NO PART IS WITHOUT THEM AND YET THEY ARE SYMMETRICAL AND SIMPLE AS THE NERVES OF THE LOWER ANIMALSAND FUNCTIONS OF THE ERVES 05 IF THE NERVES BE EXPOSED IN A LIVING ANIMAL THOSE OF THIS CLASS EXHIBIT THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF SENSIBILITY WHILE ON THE CONTRARY NERVES NOT OF THIS ORIGINAL CLASS OR SYSTEM ARE COMPARATIVELY SO LITTLE SENSIBLE AS TO BE IMMEDIATELY DISTIN GUISHED IN SO MUCH THAT THE QUIESCENCE OF THE ANIMAL SUG GESTS A DOUBT WHETHER THEY BE SENSIBLE IN ANY DEGREE WHAT EVER IF THE FIFTH NERVE AND THE PORTIO DURA OF THE SEVENTH BE BOTH EXPOSED ON THE FACE OF A LIVING ANIMAL THERE WILL NOT REMAIN THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT IN THE MIND OF THE EXPERIMENTER WHICH OF THESE NERVES BESTOWS SENSIBILITY IF THE NERVE OF THIS ORIGINAL CLASS BE DIVIDED THE SKIN AND COMMON SUBSTANCE IS DEPRIVED OF SENSIBILITY BUT IF A NERVE NOT OF THIS CLASS BE DIVIDED IT IN NO MEASURE DEPRIVES THE PARTS OF THEIR SENSI BILITY TO EXTERNAL IMPRESSION MORE PARTICULARLY OF THE RESPIRATORY NERVES THE NERVES WHICH CONNECT THE INTERNAL ORGANS OF RESPIRA TION WITH THE SENSIBILITIES OF REMOTE PARTS AND WITH THE RESPIRATORY MUSCLES ARE DISTINGUISHED FROM THOSE OF WHICH WE HAVE BEEN SPEAKING BY MANY CIRCUMSTANCES THEY DO NOT ARISE BY DOUBLE ROOTS THEY HAVE NO GANGLIA ON THEIR ORI GINS  THEY COME OFF FROM THE MEDULLA OBLONGATA AND THE UPPER PART OF THE SPINAL MARROW AND FROM THIS ORIGIN THEY DIVERGE TO THOSE SEVERAL REMOTE PARTS OF THE FRAME WHICH ARE COM BINED IN THE MOTION OF RESPIRATION THESE ARE THE NERVES WHICH GIVE THE APPEARANCE OF CONFUSION TO THE DISSECTION BECAUSE THEY CROSS THE OTHERS AND GO TO PARTS ALREADY PLENTI FULLY SUPPLIED FROM THE OTHER SYSTEM THE FOLLOWING ARE THE NERVES TO BE ENUMERATED AS RESPI RATORY NERVES ACCORDING TO THEIR FUNCTIONSMR BELLS EXPERIMENTS ON THE STRUCTURE I PAR VAGUM THE EIGHTH OF WILLIS THEPNEUMOGASTRIC NERVE OF THE MODERN FRENCH PHYSIOLOGISTS THIS NERVE GOES OFF FROM THE COMMON ORIGIN OF THE RESPIRATORY NERVES THE LATERAL PART OF THE MEDULLA OBLONGATA IT TAKES ITS COURSE TO THE LARYNX THE LUNGS THE HEART AND STOMACH IT ASSOCIATES THESE ORGANS TOGETHER WHICH ARE AT THE SAME TIME SUPPLIED WITH NERVES FROM OTHER SOURCES COMPARATIVE ANATOMY WOULD LEAD US TO INFER THAT THIS NERVE IS NOT ESSENTIAL TO THE STOMACH AS IT DOES NOT EXIST BUT WHERE THERE ARE HEART AND LUNGS TO ASSOCI ATE WITH A MUSCULAR APPARATUS OF RESPIRATION THAT THE STO MACH MUST BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE MUSCULAR APPARATUS OF RESPIRATION AS WELL AS THE LUNGS IS OBVIOUS FROM THE CON SIDERATION OF WHAT TAKES PLACE IN VOMITING AND HICCOUGH WHICH ARE ACTIONS OF THE RESPIRATORY MUSCLES EXCITED BY IRRITATION OF THE STOMACH 2 RESPIRATORY NERVE OF THE FACE BEING THAT WHICH IS CALLED PORTIO DURA OF THE SEVENTH THIS NERVE LIKE THE LAST GOES OFF FROM THE LATERAL PART OF THE MEDULLA OBLONGATA AND ESCAPING THROUGH THE TEMPORAL BONE SPREADS WIDE TO THE FACE ALL THOSE MOTIONS OF THE NOSTRIL LIPS OR FACE GENERALLY WHICH ACCORD WITH THE MOTIONS OF THE CHEST IN RESPIRATION DEPEND SOLELY ON THIS NERVE BY THE DIVISION OF THIS NERVE THE FACE IS DEPRIVED OF ITS CONSENT WITH THE LUNGS AND ALL EXPRESSION OF EMOTION THIS PART OF THE ENQUIRY WILL BE FOUND VERY INTERESTING 8 SUPERIOR RESPIRATORY NERVE OF THE TRUNK BEING THAT WHICH IS CALLED SPINAL ACCESSORY THIS NERVE HAS EXCEEDINGLY PUZZLED ANATOMISTS FROM THE SINGULAR COURSE WHICH IT PURSUES IT ARISES FROM THE SUPERIOR PART OF THE SPINAL MARROW IN A LINE WITH THE ROOTS OF THE OTHER RESPIRATORY NERVES INTSTEAD OF 4O6AND FUNCTIONS OF THE NERVES 407 GOING DIRECTLY OUT BETWIXT THE VERTEBRA AS THE REGULAR SPINAL NERVES DO IT PASSES UP INTO THE SKULL COMES OUT THROUGH THE SKULL WITH THE PAR VAGUM AND DESCENDING UPON THE NECK GOES TO THE MUSCLES OF THE SHOULDER IN THIS COURSE IT SUPPLIES MUSCLES WHICH ARE ALREADY PROFUSELY SUPPLIED BY THE REGULAR SYSTEM OF NERVES THIS NERVE CONTROULS THE OPERATIONS OF THE MUSCLES OF THE NECK AND SHOULDER IN THEIR OFFICE AS RESPIRATORY MUSCLES WHEN BY LIFTING THE SHOULDERS THEY TAKE THE LOAD FROM THE CHEST AND GIVE FREEDOM TO THE EXPANSION OF THE THORAX WHEN IT IS CUT ACROSS IN EXPERIMENTS THE MUSCLES OF THE SHOULDER WHICH WERE IN ACTION AS RESPIRATORY MUSCLES CEASE THEIR COOPERA TION BUT REMAIN CAPABLE OF VOLUNTARY ACTIONS 4 GREAT INTERNAL RESPIRATORY NERVE THE PHRENIC OR DIA PHRAGMATIC OF AUTHORS THIS IS THE ONLY NERVE OF THE SYSTEM WHICH HAS BEEN KNOWN AS A RESPIRATORY NERVE ITS ORIGIN COURSE AND DESTINATION ARE SO FAMILIAR TO EVERY ONE THAT I SHALL NOT SAY ANYTHING MORE OF IT HERE BUT THERE IS ANOTHER NERVE WHICH HAS A REMARKABLE RESEMBLANCE TO IT AND WHICH FROM CIRCUMSTANCES ALREADY NOTICED HAS BEEN ENTIRELY OVERLOOKED THIS IS 5 THE EXTERNAL RESPIRATORY NERVE THIS HAS A SIMILAR ORIGIN WITH THE PRECEDING NERVE IT COMES OUT FROM THE CERVICAL VERTEBRAE AND IS CONNECTED WITH THE PHRENIC NERVE IT RUNS DOWN THE NECK CROSSES THE CERVICAL AND AXILLARY NERVES PASSES THROUGH THE AXILLA AND ARRIVES ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE RIBS WHERE IT IS SCARCELY NECESSARY TO OBSERVE THE MUSCLES ARE ALREADY SUPPLIED BY NERVES COMING OUT BETWIXT THE RIBS FROM THE SYSTEM OF REGULAR NERVES THESE FOUR LAST MENTIONED NERVES GOVERN THE MUSCLES OFMR BELLS EXPERIMENTS ON THE STRUCTURE THE FACE NECK SHOULDERS AND CHEST IN THE ACTIONS OF EXCITED RESPIRATION AND ARE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO SPEECH AND EX PRESSION BUT THERE ARE OTHER NERVES OF THE SAME CLASS WHICH GO TO THE TONGUE THROAT AND WINDPIPE NO LESS ESSENTIAL TO COMPLETE THE ACT OF RESPIRATION THESE ARE THE GLOSSOPHA RYNGEAL NERVE THE LINGUAL OR NINTH OF WILLIS AND THE BRAN CHES OF THE PAR VAGUM TO THE SUPERIOR AND INFERIOR LARYNX WE PROCEED TO EXAMINE THESE NERVES IN DETAIL AND FIRST OF THE NERVES OF THE FACE IN WHICH IT IS SHOWN THAT THE TWO SETS OF NERVES HITHERTO SUPPOSED TO BE SIMILAR DIFFER IN STRUCTURE SENSI BILITY AND FUNCTION IT IS IN THE FACE THAT WE HAVE THE BEST OPPORTUNITY OF OB SERVING THE SUBSERVIENCE OF THE NERVES TO THE USES OF THE PARTS AND OF ASCERTAINING THE TRUTH OF THE PRECEDING DOCTRINES THE HUMAN COUNTENANCE PERFORMS MANY FUNCTIONS IN IT WE HAVE COMBINED THE ORGANS OF MASTICATION OF BREATHING OF NATURAL VOICE AND SPEECH AND OF EXPRESSION THESE MOTIONS ARE PER FORMED DIRECTLY BY THE WILL HERE ALSO ARE SEEN SIGNS OF EMOTIONS OVER WHICH WE HAVE BUT A VERY LIMITED OR IMPERFECT CONTROUL THE FACE SERVES FOR THE LOWEST ANIMAL ENJOYMENT AND PARTAKES OF THE HIGHEST AND MOST REFINED EMOTIONS HAPPILY FOR OUR PRESENT OBJECT THE NERVES WHICH IN OTHER PARTS OF THE FRAME ARE BOUND TOGETHER FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF DISTRIBUTION TO REMOTE PARTS ARE HERE DISTINCT AND RUN APART FROM EACH OTHER UNTIL THEY MEET AT THEIR EXTREMITIES THEY TAKE DIFFERENT COURSES THROUGH THE BONES OF THE HEAD AND COME OUT UPON THE FACE TO BE EXPOSED IN A MANNER WHICH COURTS ENQUIRY THIS SUBJECT IS ILLUSTRATED BY PLATE XXX WHICH REPRESENTS THE NERVES OF THE FACE 408AND FUNCTIONS OF THE NERVES THE NERVES OF THE FACE ARE FIRST THE TRIGEMINUS OR THE 5TH OF WILLIS AND THAT FAMILIARLY CALLED THE PORTIO DURA OF THE SEVENTH BUT WHICH IN THIS PAPER WILL BE CALLED THE RESPIRATORY NERVE OF THEFACE OF THE TRIGEMINUS OR FFTH PAIR IN ALL ANIMALS THAT HAVE A STOMACH WITH PALPI OR TENTACULA TO EMBRACE THEIR FOOD THE RUDIMENTS OF THIS NERVE MAY BE PERCEIVED AND ALWAYS IN THE VERMES THAT PART OF THEIR NER VOUS SYSTEM IS MOST EASILY DISCERNED WHICH SURROUNDS THE OESOPHAGUS NEAR TILE MOUTH IF A FEELER OF ANY KIND PROJECT FROM THE HEAD OF AN ANIMAL BE IT THE ANTENNA OF THE LOBSTER OR THE TRUNK OF AN ELEPHANT IT IS A BRANCH OF THIS NERVE WHICH SUPPLIES SENSIBILITY TO THE MEMBER AND ANIMATES ITS MUSCLES BUT THIS IS ONLY IF IT BE A SIMPLE ORGAN OF FEELING AND IS NOT IN ITS OFFICE CONNECTED WITH RESPIRATION FROM THE NERVE THAT COMES OFF FROM THE ANTERIOR GANGLION OF THE LEECH AND WHICH SUPPLIES ITS MOUTH WE MAY TRACE UP THROUGH THE GRADATIONS OF ANIMALS A NERVE OF TASTE AND MAN DUCATION UNTIL WE ARRIVE AT THE COMPLETE DISTRIBUTION OF THE FIFTH OR TRIGEMINUS IN MAN SEE PLATE XXX B C D WHICH ARE ITS THREE GRAND DIVISIONS TO THE FACE  HERE IN THE HIGHEST LINK AS IN THE LOWEST THE NERVE IS SUBSERVIENT TO THE SAME FUNCTIONS IT IS THE NERVE OF TASTE AND OF THE SALIVARY GLANDS OF THE MUSCLES OF THE FACE AND JAWS AND OF COMMON SEN SIBILITY THIS NERVE COMES OFF FROM THE BASE OF THE BRAIN IN SO PECULIAR A SITUATION THAT IT ALONE OF ALL THE NERVES OF THE HEAD RECEIVES ROOTS BOTH FROM THE MEDULLARY PROCESS OF THE CEREBRUM AND OF THE CEREBELLUM A GANGLION IS FORMED UPON IT NEAR ITS ORIGIN THOUGH SOME OF ITS FILAMENTS PASS ON WITHOUT ENTERING INTO THE GANGLION BEFORE PASSING OUT OF THE SKULL 409MR BELLS EXPERIMENTS ON THE STRUCTURE THE NERVE SPLITS INTO THREE GREAT DIVISIONS WHICH ARE SENT TO THE FACE JAWS AND TONGUE ITS BRANCHES GO MINUTELY INTO THE SKIN AND ENTER INTO ALL THE MUSCLES AND THEY ARE ESPECIALLY PROFUSE TO THE MUSCLES WHICH MOVE THE LIPS UPON THE TEETH OF THE RESPIRATORY NERVE OF THE FACE BEING THAT WHICH IS CALLED PORTIO DURA OF THE SEVENTH PLATE XXX A A B C D THIS NERVE DOES NOT EXIST EXCEPT WHERE THERE IS SOME CONSENT OF MOTIONS ESTABLISHED BETWIXT THE FACE AND THE RE SPIRATORY ORGANS IN FISHES THIS NERVE INSTEAD OF BEING DISTRIBUTED FORWARD TO THE FACE PASSES BACKWARD TO THE MUS CLES OF THE GILLS IN FACT THERE IS PROPERLY NO PORTIO DURA OF THE SEVENTH IN FISHES THE NERVE RESEMBLING IT BEING A BRANCH OF THE PAR VAGUM A SHORT DESCRIPTION OF THIS NERVE IN THE HUMAN BODY WILL BE NECESSARY TO OUR ENQUIRY THE RESPIRATORY NERVE OF THE FACE ARISES FROM THE SUPERIOR AND LATERAL PART OF THE MEDULLA OBLONGATA CLOSE TO THE NODUS CEREBRI AND EXACTLY WHERE THE CRUS CEREBELLI JOINS THE MEDULLA OBLONGATA THE OTHER RESPIRATORY NERVES WHICH FORM SO DIS TINGUISHED A PART OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM ARISE IN A LINE WITH THE ROOTS OF THIS THE NERVE PASSING INTO THE INTERNAL AUDITORY FORAMEN IS HERE EMBRACED BY THE PORTIO MOLLIS BUT IT SEPARATES FROM IT AND IS RECEIVED INTO AN APPROPRIATE CANAL OF THE TEMPORAL BONE A LITTLE FARTHER ON AND WHILE WITHIN THE TEMPORAL BONE TWO CORDS OF COMMUNICATION ARE FORMED WITH THE BRANCHES OF THE FIFTH NERVE OR TRIGEMINUS ONE OF THESE IS CALLED VIDIAN NERVE AND THE OTHER CORDA TYMPANI BY THESE COMMUNICATIONS  PORTIO DURA NERVI ACUSTICI SYMPATBETICUS PARVUS BY WINSLOW FACIALE BY VICQ DAZYR 410AND FUNCTIONS OF THE NERVES NERVES GO IN BOTH DIRECTIONS BRANCHES OF THE SEVENTH ARE SENT TO THE MEMBRANE OF THE NOSE AND TO THE MUSCLES AT THE BACK OF THE PALATE WHILE BRANCHES OF THE FIFTH NERVE AND ALSO OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVE ARE BROUGHT INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE EAR BY THE SECOND OF THESE COMMUNICATIONS THE CORDA TYMPANI WHICH JOINS THE LINGUAL BRANCH OF THE FIFTH JUST WHERE THAT NERVE IS PASSING BY THE SIDE OF THE LEVATOR AND CIRCUMFLEXUS PALATI THE BRANCHES OF THIS RESPIRATORY NERVE HAVE ACCESS TO THE VELUM PALATI AND ITS MUSCLES THE RESPIRATORY NERVE OF THE FACE EMERGING THROUGH THE STYLOMASTOID FORAMEN DIVIDES INTO MANY BRANCHES AND THESE DIVERGING SPREAD TO ALL THE SIDE OF THE FACE FIRST A BRANCH IS SENT TO THE MUSCLES OF THE OUTWARD EAR ANOTHER IS SENT UNDER THE ANGLE OF THE JAW TO THE MUSCLES OF THE THROAT THE PRINCIPAL NERVE THEN PASSES THROUGH THE PAROTID GLAND AND COMES UPON THE FACE HERE THE BRANCHES CONTINUE TO SCATTER TO GO UPWARDS UPON THE TEMPLE AND DOWNWARDS UPON THE SIDE OF THE NECK FORMING ON THE NECK A SUPERFICIAL PLEXUS THE PRINCIPAL BRANCHES HOWEVER GO FORWARD TO THE MUSCLES OF THE FOREHEAD AND EYELIDS A BRANCH CALLED SUPERIOR FACIAL IS SENT TO THE MUSCLES OF THE CHEEK AND THE SIDE OF THE NOSE  WHILE AN INFERIOR FACIAL BRANCH IS GIVEN TO THE ANGLE OF THE MOUTH AND THE MUSCLES WHICH CONCENTRATE THERE IN THIS EXTENSIVE DISTRIBUTION THE NERVE PENETRATES TO ALL THE MUSCLES OF THE FACE MUSCLES SUPPLIED ALSO WITH THE BRANCHES OF THE FIFTH PAIR ITS BRANCHES PENLETRATE TO THE SKIN ACCOMPANYING THE MINUTE VESSELS OF THE CHEEK THE DESCENDING OR INFERIOR DIVISIONS WHICH GO UNDER THE LOWER JAW AND TO THE SUPERFICIAL MUSCLES OF THE THROAT ND MDCCCXXI G A4I11MR BELLS EXPERIMENTS ON THE STRUCTURE NECK ARE CONNECTED WITH BRANCHES OF THE SPINAL NERVES AND WITH THE RESPIRATORY NERVES AS MAY BE SEEN IN THE ADJOINED PLATE ITS STRUCTURE WHEN WE MINUTELY OBSERVE THE TEXTURE OF THE RESPIRATORY NERVE OF THE FACE WE FIND IT TO CORRESPOND WITH THE STRUCTURE OF THE PAR VAGUM AND TO DIFFER FROM THAT OF THE TRIGEMINUS THE FILAMENTS OF THIS NERVE HAVE A VERY CLOSE TEXTURE LIKE A MINUTE PLEXUS THE FIFTH COMPARED TO IT HAS LARGE FREE ROUND FILAMENTS WITH LESS INTRICACY IN THEIR TEXTURE IF WE WERE BARELY TO CONSIDER THIS DISTRIBUTION OF THE PORTIO DURA OF THE SEVENTH UNBIASSED BY THEORY OR OPINION WE SHOULD BE FORCED TO CONCLUDE THAT IT IS NOT ALONE SUFFICIENT TO SUPPLY ANY ONE PART WITH NERVOUS POWER FOR EVERY ONE OF ITS BRANCHES IS JOINED BY DIVISIONS OF THE FIFTH THE QUESTION THEN NATURALLY ARISES WHETHER THESE NERVES PERFORM THE SAME FUNCTION  WHETHER THEY FURNISH A DOUBLE SUPPLY OF THE SAME PROPERTY OR ENDOWMENT OR WHETHER THEY DO NOT PERFORM DIFFERENT OFFICES HAVING TAKEN ALL THE ASSISTANCE THAT THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE HUMAN STRUCTURE AND COMPARATIVE ANATOMY AFFORD WE ARE PREPARED TO DECIDE THE MATTER BY EXPERIMENT EXPERIMENTS ON THE NERVES OF THE FACE AN ASS BEING THROWN AND ITS NOSTRILS CONFINED FOR A FEW SECONDS SO AS TO MAKE IT PANT AND FORCIBLY DILATE THE NOSTRILS AT EACH INSPIRATION THE PORTIO DURA WAS DIVIDED ON ONE SIDE OF THE HEAD THE MOTION OF THE NOSTRIL OF THE SAME SIDE IN STANTLY CEASED WHILE THE OTHER NOSTRIL CONTINUED TO EXPAND AND CONTRACT IN UNISON WITH THE MOTIONS OF THE CHEST ON THE DIVISION OF THE NERVE THE ANIMAL GAVE NO SIGN OF A412ANDFITNCTIONS 6F THE NERVES PAIN THERE WAS NO STRUGGLE NOR EFFORT MADE WHEN IT WAS CUT ACROSS THE ANIMAL BEING UNTIED AND CORN AND HAY GIVEN TO HIM HE EAT WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST IMPEDIMENT AN ASS BEING TIED AND THROWN THE SUPERIOR MAXILLARY BRANCH OF THE FIFTH NERVE WAS EXPOSED TOUCHING THIS NERVE GAVE ACUTE PAIN IT WAS DIVIDED BUT NO CHANGE TOOK PLACE IN THE MOTION OF THE NOSTRIL THE CARTILAGES CONTINUED TO EX PAND REGULARLY IN TIME WITH THE OTHER PARTS WHICH COMBINE IN THE ACT OF RESPIRATION BUT THE SIDE OF THE LIP WAS OBSERVED TO HANG LOW AND IT WAS DRAGGED TO THE OTHER SIDE THE SAME BRANCH OF THE FIFTH WAS DIVIDED ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE AND THE ANIMAL LET LOOSE HE COULD NO LONGER PICK UP HIS CORN THE POWER OF ELEVATING AND PROJECTING THE LIP AS IN GATHERING FOOD WAS LOST TO OPEN THE LIPS THE ANIMAL PRESSED THE MOUTH AGAINST THE GROUND AND AT LENGTH LICKED THE OATS FROM THE GROUND WITH HIS TONGUE THE LOSS OF MOTION OF THE LIPS IN EATING WAS SO OBVIOUS THAT IT WAS THOUGHT A USELESS CRUELTY TO CUT THE OTHER BRANCHES OF THE FIFTH THIS EXPERIMENT OF CUTTING THE RESPIRATORY NERVE OF THE FACE OR PORTHO DURA GAVE SO LITTLE PAIN THAT IT WAS SEVERAL TIMES REPEATED ON THE ASS AND DOG AND UNIFORMLY WITH THE SAME EFFECT THE SIDE OF THE FACE REMAINED AT REST AND PLACID DURING THE HIGHEST EXCITEMENT OF THE OTHER PARTS OF THE RE SPIRATORY ORGANS WHEN THE ASS ON WHICH THE RESPIRATORY NERVE OF THE FACE HAD BEEN CUT WAS KILLED WHICH WAS DONE BY BLEEDING AN UNEXPECTED OPPORTUNITY WAS OFFERED OF ASCERTAINING ITS INFLUENCE BY THE NEGATION OF ITS POWERS ON THE SIDE OF THE FACE WHERE IT WAS CUT ACROSS 4 13MR BELLS EXPERIENTS ON THE STRUCTURE 414 WHEN AN ANIMAL BECOMES INSENSIBLE FROM LOSS OF BLOOD THE IMPRESSION AT THE HEART EXTENDS ITS INFLUENCE IN VIOLENT CONVULSIONS OVER ALL THE MUSCLES OF RESPIRATION NOT ONLY IS THE AIR DRAWN INTO THE CHEST WITH SUDDEN AND POWERFUL EFFORT BUT AT THE SAME INSTANT THE MUSCLES OF THE MOUTH NOSTRILS AND EYELIDS AND ALL THE SIDE OF THE FACE ARE IN A VIOLENT STATE OF SPASM IN THE ASS WHERE THE RESPIRATORY NERVE OF THE FACE HAD BEEN CUT THE MOST REMARKABLE CONTRAST WAS EXHIBITED IN THE TWO SIDES OF ITS FACE FOR WHILST THE ONE SIDE WAS IN UNIVERSAL AND POWERFUL CONTRACTION THE OTHER WHERE THE NERVE WAS DIVIDED REMAINED QUITE PLACID FROM THESE FACTS WE ARE ENTITLED TO CONCLUDE THAT THE PORTIO DURA OF THE SEVENTH IS THE RESPIRATORY NERVE OF THE FACE THAT THE MOTIONS OF THE LIPS THE NOSTRILS AND THE VELUM PALATI ARE GOVERNED BY ITS INFLUENCE WHEN THE MUSCLES OF THESE PARTS ARE IN ASSOCIATED ACTION WITH THE OTHER ORGANS OF RESPIRATION THESE PASSAGES TO THE LUNGS ARE MEMBRANOUS TUBES MOVED BY MUSCLES WHICH SERVE TO EXPAND AND WIDEN THEM SO THAT THE AIR MAY FREELY ENTER INTO THE LUNGS IT IS OB VIOUS THAT TO PRODUCE THIS THESE MUSCLES MUST HAVE A CONSENT WITH THE OTHER MUSCLES OF RESPIRATION AND MOVE SIMULTANE OUSLY WITH THEM AND THIS IS EFFECTED THROUGH THE RESPIRATORY NERVE OF THE FACE IT SHALL BE PROVED IN THE SEQUEL THAT THE THROAT NECK SHOULDERS AND CHEST HAVE SIMILAR NERVES TO THIS SIMILAR IN STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION AND THAT THESE UNITE ALL THE EXTENDED APPARATUS OF BREATHING AND SPEAKING HE ACTIONS OF SNEEZING AND COUGHING ARE ENTIRELY CON FINED TO THE INFLUENCE OF THE RESPIRATORY NERVES WHEN CARBONATE OF AMMONIA WAS PUT TO THE NOSTRILS OF THE ASS WHOSE RESPIRATORY NERVE HAD BEEN CUT THAT SIDE OF THE NOSE AND FACEAND FUNCTIONS OF THE NERVES WHERE THE NERVES WERE ENTIRE WAS CURLED UP WITH THE PECULIAR EXPRESSION OF SNEEZING BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE WHERE THE NERVE WAS DIVIDED THE FACE REMAINED QUITE RELAXED ALTHOUGH THE BRANCHES OF THE FIFTH PAIR AND THE SYMPATHETIC WERE EN TIRE THE RESPIRATORY NERVE OF ONE SIDE OF THE FACE OF A DOG BEING CUT THE SAME EFFECT WAS PRODUCED THE ACTION OF SNEEZ ING WAS ENTIRELY CONFINED TO ONE SIDE OF THE FACE THESE LAST EXPERIMENTS SHOW THAT THE PECULIAR EXPRESSION IN SNEEZING RESULTS FROM AN IMPRESSION ON THE RESPIRATORY NERVES AND THAT THE MUSCLES OF THE FACE ARE DRAWN INTO SYM PATHY SOLELY BY THE INFLUENCE OF THE RESPIRATORY NERVE OF THE FACE THERE IS NO PART OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM WHERE THE ANATOMY HAS BEEN MORE NEGLIGENTLY CONSULTED IN FORMING OUR PHYSIO LOGICAL OPINIONS THAN IN WHAT REGARDS THE OFFICE OF THE SYMPA THETIC NERVE THE CONNECTIONS OF THIS NERVE OR RATHER SYSTEL OF NERVES BEING UNIVERSAL IT HAS BEEN SUPPOSED THAT IT WAS THE CHORD THROUGH WHICH THE RELATIONS OF THE EYE NOSE FACE TLROAT DIAPHRAGM C WERE ESTABLISHED WHEREAS THE COM BINATION IS EFFECTED SOLELY THROUGH THOSE NERVES WHICH FROM THEIR GRAND OR LEADING FUNCTION I HAVE CALLED THE RESPIRATORY NERVES IT HAS BEEN PRESUMED THAT THE ACT OF SMILING IS PECULIAR TO THE HUMAN COUNTENANCE AND THAT IN NO OTHER CREATURE CAN THERE ARISE THAT STATE OF ENJOYMENT WHICH PRODUCES THIS DIS TINGUISHING CHARACTER OF THE HUMAN FACE THE EXPRESSION OF BENEVOLENCE OR OF THE ENJOYMENT OF THE RIDICULOUS BUT EVERY ONE MUST HAVE OBSERVED HOW NEAR THE APPROACH IS TO THIS EXPRESSION IN A DOG WHEN HE FAWNS ON HIS MASTER AND LEAPS AND TWISTS HIS BODY AND WAGS HIS TAIL WHILE AT THE SAME TIME 415MR BELLS EXPERIMENTSON THE STRCTURE HE TURNS OUT THE EDGE OF THE LIPS AS LIKE A LAUGH AS HIS ORGANS CAN EXPRESS WHEN THE RESPIRATORY NERVE ON ONE SIDE OF THE DOGS HEAD WAS CUT ACROSS THIS MOTION OF THE LIPS NO LONGER TOOK PLACE ALTHOUGH IT WAS STILL OBSERVABLE ON THE OTHER SIDE WHERE THE NERVE WAS ENTIRE ON CUTTING THE RESPIRATORY NERVE ON ONE SIDE OF THE FACE OF A MONKEY THE VERY PECULIAR ACTIVITY OF HIS FEATURES ON THAT SIDE CEASED ALTOGETHER THE TIMID MOTIONS OF HIS EYELIDS AND EYEBROWS WERE LOST AND HE COULD NOT WINK ON THAT SIDE AND HIS LIPS WERE DRAWN TO THE OTHER SIDE LIKE A PARALYTIC DRUNKARD WHENEVER HE SHOWED HIS TEETH IN RAGE WE HAVE PROOFS EQUAL TO EXPERIMENTS THAT IN THE HUMAN FACE THE ACTIONS OF THE MUSCLES WHICH PRODUCE SMILING AND LAUGHING ARE A CONSEQUENCE OF THE INFLUENCE OF THIS RESPIRATORY NERVE A MAN HAD THE TRUNK OF THE RESPIRATORY NERVE OF THE FACE INJURED BY A SUPPURATION WHICH TOOK PLACE ANTERIOR TO THE EAR AND THROUGH WHICH THE NERVE PASSED IN ITS COURSE TO THEFACE IT WAS OBSERVED THAT IN SMILING AND LAUGHING HIS MOUTH WAS DRAWN IN A VERY REMARKABLE MANNER TO THE OPPO SITE SIDE THE ATTEMPT TO WHISTLE WAS ATTENDED WITH A LUDI CROUS DISTORTION OF THE LIPS WHEN HE TOOK SNUFF AND SNEEZED THE SIDE WHERE THE SUPPURATION HAD AFFECTED THE NERVE REMAINED PLACID WHILE THE OPPOSITE SIDE EXHIBITED THE USUAL DISTOR TION THUS IT APPEARS THAT WHENEVER THE ACTION OF ANY OF THE MUSCLES OF THE FACE IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACT OF BREATHING IT IS PERFORMED THROUGH THE OPERATION OF THIS NERVE I CUT A TUMOR FROM BEFORE THE EAR OF A COACHMAN A BRANCH OF THE NERVE WHICH GOES TO THE ANGLE OF THE MOUTH WAS DIVIDED SOME TIME AFTER HE RETURNED TO THANK ME FOR RIDDING HIM OF A 416AND FUNCTIONS OF THE NERVES FORMIDABLE DISEASE BUT COMPLAINED THAT HE COULD NOT WHISTLE TO HIS HORSES OF THE FUNCTION OF THE TRIGEMINUS OR FIFTH NERVE AS ILLUSTRATED BY THESE EXPERIMENTS WE HAVE SEEN THAT WHEN THE FIFTH NERVE THE NERVE OF MASTICATION AND SENSATION WAS CUT IN AN ASS THE ANIMAL COULD NO LONGER GATHER HIS FOOD IN THE INDIVIDUAL WHOSE FACE WAS PARALYZED ON ONE SIDE DURING THE EXCITED STATE OF THE RESPI RATORY ORGANS THERE COULD BE OBSERVED NO DEBILITY OR PARA LYSIS IN THE SAME MUSCLES WHEN HE TOOK A MORSEL INTO HIS MOUTH AND BEGAN TO CHEW BY AN EXPERIMENT MADE ON THE I6TH OF MARCH IT WAS FOUND THAT ON CUTTING THE INFRAORBITARY BRANCH OF THE FIFTH NERVE ON THE LEFT SIDE AND THE PORTIO DURA OR RESPIRATORY ON TILE RIGHT SIDE OF AN ASS THE SENSIBILITY TO PAIN ON THE RIGHT SIDE WHERE THE PORTIO DURA OF THE SEVENTH NERVE WAS CUT REMAINED EN TIRE WHILE THAT OF THE LEFT SIDE WAS COMPLETELY DESTROYED BY THE DIVISION OF THE FIFTH IT WAS ALSO APPARENT IN THIS EXPERI MENT AS IN THE OTHERS THAT THERE WAS THE MOST MARKED DIF FERENCE IN THE SUFFERINGS OF THE ANIMAL WHEN THESE NERVES WERE CUT ACROSS THE CUTTING OF THE FIFTH NERVE GAVE PAIN IN A DEGREE CORRESPONDING WITH OUR NOTIONS OF THE SENSIBILITY OF NERVES BUT IN CUTTING THE PORTIO DURA IT WAS NOT EVIDENT THAT THE ANIMAL SUFFERED PAIN AT ALL INDEPENDENTLY OF THE DIFFERENCE OF SENSIBILITY IN THESE NERVES THERE WAS EXHIBITED IN ALL THESE EXPERIMENTS A WIDE DISTINC TION IN THEIR POWERS OF EXCITING THE MUSCLES THE SLIGHTEST TOUCH ON THE PORTIO DURA OR RESPIRATORY NERVE CONVULSED THE MUSCLES OF THE FACE WHILST THE ANIMAL GAVE NO SIGN OF PAIN 4L7MR BELLS EXPERIMENTS ON THE STRUCTURE BY MEANS OF THE BRANCHES OF THE FIFTH NERVE IT WAS MORE DIFFICULT TO PRODUCE ANY DEGREE OF ACTION IN THE MUSCLES AL THOUGH AS I HAVE SAID TOUCHING THE NERVE GAVE GREAT PAIN I DIVIDED THE BRANCH OF THE FIFTH PAIR WHICH GOES TO THE FOREHEAD IN A MAN AT HIS URGENT REQUEST ON ACCOUNT OF THE TIC DOLOUREUX THERE FOLLOWED NO PARALYSIS OF THE MUSCLES OF THE EYEBROW BUT IN AN INDIVIDUAL WHERE AN ULCER AND ABSCESS SEATED ANTERIOR TO THE TUBE OF THE EAR AFFECTED THE SUPERIOR BRANCH OF THE RESPIRATORY NERVE THE EYEBROW FELL LOW AND DID NOT FOLLOW THE OTHER WHEN THE FEATURES WERE ANIMATED BY DISCOURSE OR EMOTION IT WILL BE ASKED WHY A NERVE CALLED RESPIRATORY SHOULD GO TO THE EAR AND THE EYE  FIRST LET US ENQUIRE DOES IT BELONG TO THE FRAME OF ANIMAL BODIES THAT THERE SHALL BE IN THEM INDI CATIONS OF PASSION  IF IT BE ADMITTED THAT THIS IS THE CASE WE HERE LEARN IN ADDITION THAT AS THE PORTIO DURA IS THE NERVE OF RESPIRATION SO IS IT THE GRAND NERVE OF EXPRESSION NOT ONLY IN MAN BUT IN BRUTES ALSO ALL THAT EXCITEMENT SEEN IN A DOGS HEAD HIS EYES HIS EARS WHEN FIGHTING DISAPPEARS IF THIS NERVE BE CUT THE RESPIRATORY NERVE BEING CUT ACROSS IN A TERRIER THE SIDE OF THE FACE WAS DEPRIVED OF ALL EXPRESSION WHETHER HE WAS MADE TO CROUCH OR TO FACE AN OPPONENT AND SNARL WHEN ANOTHER DOG WAS BROUGHT NEAR AND HE BEGAN TO SNARL AND EXPOSE HIS TEETH THE FACE WHICH WAS BALANCED BEFORE BECAME TWISTED TO ONE SIDE TO THAT SIDE WHERE THE NERVE WAS ENTIRE AND THE EYELIDS BEING IN THIS STATE OF EX CITEMENT VERY DIFFERENTLY AFFECTED PRESENTED A SINISTER AND LUDICROUS EXPRESSION ON CUTTING THE RESPIRATORY NERVE OF THE FACE IN THE CARNI VOROUS ANIMALS IT DID NOT APPEAR THAT THE ACTION OF FEEDING 48AND FUNCTIONS OF THE NERVES WAS LEFT SO ENTIRE AS IN THE GRAMINIVOROUS ANIMALS THIS LEADS US TO REFLECT ON THE DIFFERENT NATURES OF THE TWO CLASSES THE BEAST OF PREY PROCURES HIS FOOD UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A BLOODTHIRSTY APPETITE AND SUFFERS A UNIVERSAL EXCITEMENT HE HOLDS AND RENDS HIS PREY  AND ESPECIALLY IN THE LARGER ANIMALS OF THIS CLASS THE ACTION OF FEEDING IS ACCOMPANIED WITH HORRIFIC SOUNDS OF ENJOYMENT IN SHORT WITH A HIGHLY EXCITED STATE OF THE ORGANS OF RESPIRATION IN THE GRAMINIVOROUS ANIMALS THE ACT OF FEEDING IS A SIMPLE AND UNEMPASSIONED EXERCISE OF THE ORGANS OF MASTICATION THE AUTHOR HOPES THAT THESE EXPERIMENTS WILL BE DEEMED CONCLUSIVE YET IT IS A PLEASANTER MODE OF INVESTIGATION TO HAVE RECOURSE TO COMPARATIVE ANATOMY THERE IS ONLY ONE ADDI TIONAL INSTANCE OF THIS KIND THAT HE WILL OFFER IT HAS BEEN ALREADY STATED THAT WHEN A FEELER OR ANTENNA IS EXAMINED IF IT BE SIMPLY FOR SENSATION ONE NERVE ONLY RUNS ALONG IT IT WAS SUGGESTED TO HIM THAT IF HIS THEORY WERE TRUE THE TRUNK OF THE ELEPHANT BEING HOLLOW AND CONNECTED WITH RESPIRATION IT SHOULD HAVE TWO NERVES WHEREAS IN THE OBSERVATIONS OF CUVIER IT WAS STATED TO HAVE ONLY ONE AN OPPORTUNITY OF ASCERTAINING THE TRUTH OF THIS WAS VERY LIBERALLY GRANTED BY MR HERBERT MAYO WHO HAD LATELY A YOUNG ELEPHANT FOR DISSECTION THE TWO NERVES WERE READILY FOUND BOTH OF GREAT SIZE THE ONE A CONTINUATION OF THE SUPERIOR MAXILLARY BRANCH OF THE FIFTH THE OTHER A CONTINUATION OF THE RESPIRATORY OR SEVENTH HAVING BROUGHT THIS INVESTIGATION TO A CONCLUSION SOME PERHAPS FATIGUED BY ITS DETAILS MAY ASK TO WHAT DOES THIS DISCUSSION LEAD  WERE WE TO ENQUIRE NO FARTHER AND TO REST CONTENT WITH MDCCXXI 3 H 419MR BELLS EXPERIMENTS ON THE STRUCTURE THE INFERENCE THAT THE TWO SETS OF NERVES DISTRIBUTED TO THE FACE HAVE DISTINCT FUNCTIONS EVEN THIS MUST PROVE USEFUL BOTH TO THE SURGEON AND PHYSICIAN TO THE SURGEON IT MUST BE USEFUL IN PERFORMING OPERATIONS ON THE FACE AS WELL AS IN OB SERVING THE SYMPTOMS OF DISEASE BUT ESPECIALLY TO THE PHY SICIAN MUST THESE FACTS BE IMPORTANT HE WILL BE BETTER ABLE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THAT PARALYSIS WHICH PROCEEDS FROM THE BRAIN AND THAT PARTIAL AFFECTION OF THE MUSCLES OF THE FACE WHEN FROM A LESS ALARMING CAUSE THEY HAVE LOST THE CONTROUL ING INFLUENCE OF THE RESPIRATORY NERVE CASES OF THIS PARTIAL PARALYSIS MUST BE FAMILIAR TO EVERY MEDICAL OBSERVER IT IS VERY FREQUENT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO HAVE WHAT IS VULGARLY CALLED A BLIGHT BY WHICH IS MEANT A SLIGHT PALSY OF THE MUSCLES ON ONE SIDE OF THE FACE AND WHICH THE PHYSICIAN KNOWS IS NOT FORMIDABLE INFLAMMATIONS OF GLANDS SEATED BEHIND THE ANGLE OF THE JAW WILL SOMETIMES PRODUCE THIS ALL SUCH AFFECTIONS OF THE RESPIRATORY NERVE WILL NOW BE MORE EASILY DETECTED THE PATIENT HAS A COMMAND OVER THE MUSCLES OF THE FACE HE CAN CLOSE THE LIPS AND THE FEATURES ARE DULY BALANCED  BUT THE SLIGHTEST SMILE IS IMMEDI ATELY ATTENDED WITH DISTORTION AND IN LAUGHING AND CRYING THE PARALYSIS BECOMES QUITE DISTINCT THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SOURCES OF EXPRESSION TEACHES US TO BE MORE MINUTE OBSERVERS THE AUTHOR HAD LATELY TO WATCH THE BREATHING OF AN INFANT WHICH HAD BEEN SEVERAL TIMES RE STORED FROM A STATE OF INSENSIBILITY AT LENGTH THE GENERAL POWERS FELL LOW WITHOUT ANY RETURNING FIT INSENSIBILITY AND LOSS OF MOTION STOLE OVER THE FRAME  ALL BUT THE ACTIONS EXCITED BY THE RESPIRATORY NERVES CEASED  THEN EACH ACT OF RESPIRATION WAS ATTENDED WITH A TWITCHING OF THE MUSCLES OF THE ALA NASIANDFUNCTIONS OF THE NERVES 421 AND OF THAT MUSCLE OF THE CHEEK WHICH MAKES THE DIMPLE IN SMILING IT WAS THEN EVIDENT THAT THE CHILD COULD NOT RECOVER THAT ALL BUT THE SYSTEM OF RESPIRATORY NERVES HAD LOST THEIR POWERS THAT THE FEATURES AS FAR AS THEY WERE SUBJECT TO THE INFLUENCE OF THE OTHER NERVES HAD FALLEN THERE ARE CONDITIONS OF THE LUNGS WHEN THE PATIENT IS IN GREAT DANGER AND YET THE INFLAMMATION IS NOT MARKED BY THE USUAL SIGNS OF PAIN AND DIFFICULT MOTION OF THE CHEST WE SHALL SEE NOTHING BUT THE TWITCHING OF THOSE MUSCLES OF THE FACE WHICH ARE ANIMATED BY THE RESPIRATORY NERVE WE SEE A CERTAIN UNUSUAL DILATATION OF THE NOSTRILS AND A CONSTRAINED MOTION OF THE LIPS WHICH WITH THE CHANGE OF VOICE IS JUST SUFFICIENT TO GIVE ALARM AND INDICATE THE PATIENTS CONDITION THIS IS A STATE OF THE LUNGS VERY OFTEN PRODUCED AFTER SEVERE ACCIDENTS AS GUNSHOT WOUNDS AND AFTER GREAT SURGICAL OPERA TIONS THESE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE STATED TO PROVE THAT THE SUBJECT OF EXPRESSION IS NOT FOREIGN TO MEDICAL STUDIES AND CERTAINLY BY ATTENTION TO THE ACTION OF THE MUSCLES OF THE FACE WE SHALL FIND THE VIEWS DRAWN HERE FROM THE ANATOMY FARTHER COUNTENANCED WE LEARN THAT SMILING IS AN AFFCTION OF THE NERVE OF RESPIRATION ON THE MUSCLES OF THE FACE AND THAT WHEN LAUGHTER SHAKES THE SIDES IT IS ONLY AN EXTENDED AND MORE CONVULSIVE ACTION OF THE MUSCLES PRODUCED BY THE SAME CLASS OF NERVES WHEN TO THE PALENESS AND COLDNESS AND INANIMATION OF GRIEF THERE IS ADDED THE CONVULSIVE SOB AND THE CATCHING OF THE THROAT AND THE TWITCHING OF THE LIPS AND NOSTRILS WE DISCOVER THE SAME CLASS OF NERVES TO BE AFFECTED WHICH IN CRYING ARE ONLY MORE OBVIOUSLY IN OPERATION PRO DUCING MORE VIOLENT CONTRACTIONSMR BELLS EXPERIMENTS ON THE STRUCTURE IN ALL THE INTERMEDIATE EMOTIONS BETWEEN TLLESE EXTREMES THE VARIETIES OF EXPRESSION IN THE FACE ARE PRODUCED BY THE OPPO SITION OF THE TWO POWERS AFFECTING THE SAME MUSCLES THE ONE IS A VOLUNTARY POWER BY WHICH WE RESTRAIN THE FEATURES AND CONCEAL EMOTION THE OTHER IS AN INVOLUNTARY POWER WHICH CANNOT BE ALWAYS CONTROULED BUT WHICH WILL SOMETIMES HAVE SWAY AND MINGLE ITS INFLUENCE CONCLUSION WHEN THE ACCOUNT OF THE NERVES OF THE THROAT NECK AND CHEST SHALL BE LAID BEFORE THE ROYAL SOCIETY AS THOSE OF THE FACE HAVE NOW BEEN AND WHEN A COMPARISON SHALL BE MADE OF THE VARIETIES IN NERVES CORRESPONDING WITH THE CHANGES IN THE MECHANISM OF RESPIRATION IN DIFFERENT ANIMALS A JUSTER ESTI MATE MAY BE FORMED OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE OBSERVATIONS THEN THE SAME DISTINCTIONS OF STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION WHICH ARE MADE MANIFEST IN THE NERVES OF THE FACE WILL BE OBSERVED IN NERVES WHICH TAKE AN EXTENSIVE COURSE THROUGH THE BODY WE SHALL BE ABLE TO DISTINGUISH AND SEPARATE THE NERVES OF RESPIRATION AMIDST THE APPARENT INTRICACY OF THE GENERAL SYSTEM BY CUTTING ACROSS THESE NERVES OF RESPIRATION WE SHALL FIND IT POSSIBLE SUCCESSIVELY TO STOP THE MOTIONS OF THE SEVERAL PARTS WHICH UNITE IN THE ACT OF RESPIRATION NOT ONLY TO STOP THE MOTION OF THE DIAPHRAGM BUT THE MOTIONS OF THE SIDE OF THE SHOULDER OF THE LARYNX OR THE PHARYNX BY CUTTING THEIR RESPECTIVE RESPIRATORY NERVES WHEN THIS IS DONE THEY WILL BE LEFT IN THE EXERCISE OF THEIR OTHER FUNCTIONS THROUGH THEIR OTHER NERVES AND STILL ALIVE TO OTHER EXCITEMENTS AND CAPABLE OF PERFORMING THE VOLUNTARY MOTIONS THOUGH DEAD TO THE INFLUENCE OF THE HEART AND LUNGS 42SAND FUNCTIONS OF THE NERVES BY THUS DISTINGUISHING THE NERVES OF RESPIRATION AND AS IT WERE SEPARATING THEM FROM THE OTHERS WE REDUCE THE RE MAINING PART OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM TO COMPARATIVE SIMPLICITY THE SEEMING INTRICACY IN THE BRANCHING OF THE NERVES THEIR CONVERGENCE TO CERTAIN ORGANS FROM DIFFERENT ORIGINS THEIR REUNION AND DIVERGENCE INSTEAD OF BEING A SOURCE OF CONFU SION BECOMES A SUBJECT OF THE HIGHEST INTEREST THE REUNION AND CROSSING OF NERVES WE NOW ASCERTAIN TO BE FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASSOCIATING THE MUSCLES INTO DIFFERENT CLASSES FOR COMBINING THEM IN SUBSERVIENCY TO DIFFERENT ORGANS AND PLACING THEM UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF A SENSIBILITY MORE CERTAIN IN ITS OPERA TION THAN THE WILL BY THESE OBSERVATIONS SIMPLICITY AND ARRANGEMENT ARE NOW THE CHARACTERS OF OUR ANATOMICAL DEMONSTRATIONS

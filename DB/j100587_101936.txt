J100587,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 16831775,101936,AN ACCOUNT OF THE SEVERAL SPECIES OF INFINITE QUANTITY AND OF THE PROPORTIONS THEY BEAR ONE TO THE OTHER AS IT WAS READ BEFORE THE ROYAL SOCIETY BY E HALLEY,I206881,556 AN ACCOUNT OF THE SEVERAL SPECIES OF INFINITE QUANTITY AND OF THE PROPORTIONS THEY BEAR ONE TO THE OTHER AS IT WAS READ BEFORE THE ROYAL SOCIETY BY E HALLEY THAT ALL MAGNITUDES INFINITELY GREAT OR SUCH AS EXCEED ANY ASSIGNABLE QUANTITY ARE EQUAL AMONG THEMSELVES THOUGH IT BE VULGARLY RECEIVED FOR A MAXIM IS NOT YET SO COMMON AS IT IS ERRONEOUS AND THE REASON OF THE MISTAKE SEEMS TO BE THAT THE MIND OF MAN COMING TO CONTEMPLATE THE EXTENSIONS OF WHAT EXCEEDS THE BOUNDS OF ITS CAPACITY AND OF WHICH THE VERY IDEA DOES INCLUDE A NEGATION OF LIMITS IT COMES TO PASS THAT WE ACQUIESCE GENERALLY AND IT SUF FICES TO SAY SUCH A QUANTITY IS INFINITE BUT IF WE COME MORE NEARLY TO EXAMINE THIS NOTION WE SHALL FIND THAT THERE ARE REALLY BESIDES INFINITE LENGTH AND INFINITE AREA NO LESS THAN THREE SEVERAL SORTS OF INFINITE SOLIDITY ALL OF WHICH ARE QUANTITATES SUI GENERIS HAVING NO MORE RELATION OR PROPORTION THE ONE TO THE OTHER THAN A LINE TO A PLANE OR A PLANE TO A SOLID OR A FINITE TO AN INFINITE BUT THATAMONG THEM SELVES EACH OF THOSE SPECIES OF INFINITES ARE IN GIVEN PROPORTIONS IS WHAT I NOW INTEND TO MAKE PLAIN IF POSSIBLE BUT FIRST INFINITE LENGTH OR A LINE INFINITELY LONG IS TO BE CONSIDERED EITHER AS BEGINNING AT A POINT AND SO INFINITELY EXTENDED ONE WAY OR ELSE BOTH WAYS FROM THE SAME POINT IN WHICH CASE THE ONE WHICH IS A BE GINNING INFINITY IS THE ONE HALF OF THE WHOLE WHICH IS THE SUMM OF THE BEGINNING AND CEASING INFINITY OR AS I MAY SAY OF INFINITY A PARTE ANTE AND A PARTE POST WHICH IS ANALOGOUS TO ETERNITY IN TIME OR DURATION IN WHICH THERE IS ALWAYS AS MUCH TO FOLLOW AS IS PAST FROM ANY POINT557 POINT  MOMENT OF TIME NOR DOTH THE ADDITION OR SUBDUCTION OF FINITE LENGTH OR SPACE OF TIME ALTER THE CASE EITHER IN INFINITY OR ETERNITY SINCE BOTH THE ONE OR THE OTHER CANNOT BE ANY PART OF THE WHOLE AS TO INFINITE SURFACE OR AREA ANY RIGHT LINE INFINITELY EXTENDED BOTH WAYS ON AN INFINITE PLANE DOES DIVIDE THAT INFINITE PLANE INTO EQUAL PARTS THE ONE TO THE RIGHT AND THE OTHER TO THE LEFT OF THE SAID LINE BUT IF FROM ANY POINT IN SUCH A PLANE TWO RIGHT LINES BE IN FINITELY EXTENDED SO AS TO MAKE AN ANGLE THE INFINITE AREA INTERCEPTED BETWEEN THOSE INFINITE RIGHT LINES IS TO THE WHOLE INFINITE PLANE AS THE ARCH OF A CIRCLE ON THE POINT OF CONCOURSE OF THOSE LINES AS A CENTRE INTER CEPTED BETWEEN THE SAID LINES IS TO THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE CIRCLE OR AS THE DEGREES OF THE ANGLE TO THE 360 DEGREES OF A CIRCLE FOR EXAMPLE TWO RIGHT LINES MEETING AT A RIGHT ANGLE DO INCLUDE ON AN INFI NITE PLANE A QUARTER PART OF THE WHOLE INFINITE AREA OF SUCH A PLANE BUT IF SO BE TWO PARALLEL INFINITE LINES BE SUPPOSED DRAWN ON SUCH AN INFINITE PLANE THE AREA INTERCEPTED BETWEEN THEM WILL BE LIKEWISE INFINITE BUT AT THE SAME TIME WILL BE INFINITELY LESS THAN THAT SPACE WHICH IS INTER CEPTED BETWEEN TWO INFINITE LINES THAT ARE INCLINED THO WITH NEVER SO SMALL AN ANGLE FOR THAT IN THE ONE CASE THE GIVEN FINITE DISTANCE OF THE PARALLEL LINES DI MINISHES THE INFINITY IN ONE DEGREE OF DIMENSION WHEREAS IN A SECTOR THERE IS INFINITY IN BOTH DIMENSI ONS AND CONSEQUENTLY THE QUANTITIES ARE THE ONE INFI NITELY GREATER THAN THE OTHER AND THERE IS NO PROPORTI ON BETWEEN THEM FROM THE SAME CONSIDERATION ARISE THE THREE SEVE RAL SPECIES OF INFINITE SPACE OR SOLIDITYAS HAS BEEN SAID FOR A PARALLELEPIPIDE OR A CYLINDER INFINITELY LONG IS GREATER THAN ANY FINITE MAGNITUDE HOW GREAT SOEVER AND ALL SUCH SOLIDS SUPPOSED TO BE FORMED ON GIVEN BASES P 2 ARE558 ARE AS THOSE BASES IN PROPORTION TO ONE ANOTHER BUT IF TWO OF THESE THREE DIMENSIONS ARE WANTING AS IN THE SPACE INTERCEPTED BETWEEN TWO PARALLEL PLANES INFINITE LY EXTENDED AND AT A FINITE DISTANCE OR WITH INFINITE LENGTH AND BREADTH WITH A FINITE THICKNESS ALL SUCH SOLIDS SHALL BE AS THE GIVEN FINITE DISTANCES ONE TO ANO THER BUT THESE QUANTITIES THO INFINITELY GREATER THAN THE OTHER ARE YET INFINITELY LESS THAN ANY OF THOSE WHEREIN ALL THE THREE DIMENSIONS ARE INFINITE SUCH ARE THE SPACES INTERCEPTED BETWEEN TWO INCLINED PLANES IN FINITELY EXTENDED THE SPACE INTERCEPTED BY THE SURFACE OF A CONE OR THE SIDES OF A PYRAMID LIKEWISE INFINITELY CONTINUED C OF ALL WHICH NOTWITHSTANDING THE PRO PORTIONS ONE TO ANOTHERAND TO THE   OR VAST ABYSS OF INFINITE SPACE WHEREIN IS THE LOCUS OF ALL THINGS THAT ARE OR CAN BE OR TO THE SOLID OF INFINITE LENGTH BREADTH AND THICKNESS TAKEN ALL MANNER OF WAYS ARE EASILY AS SIGNABLE FOR THE SPACE BETWEEN TWO PLANES IS TO THE WHOLE AS THE ANGLE OF THOSE PLANES TO THE 360 DEGREES OF THE CIRCLE AS FOR CONES AND PYRAMIDS THEY ARE AS THE SPHERICAL SURFACE INTERCEPTED BY THEM IS TO THE SURFACE OF THE SPHERE AND THEREFORE CONES ARE AS THE VERTED SINES OF HALFTHEIR ANGLES TO THE DIAMETER OF THE CIRCLE THESE THREE SORTS OF INFINITE QUANTITY ARE ANALOGOUS TO A LINE A SURFACE AND SOLID AND AFTER THE SAME MANNER CANNOT BE COMPARED OR HAVE NO PROPORTION THE ONE TO THE OTHER BESIDES THESE THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER SPECIES OF INFI NITE QUANTITY ARISING FROM THE CONTEMPLATION OF CURVES AND THEIR ASYMPTOTES WHICH BY REASON OF THE DIFFICULTY OF THE UBJECT CANNOT BE MADE SO PLAIN TO MOST READERS BUT WHAT HAS BEEN ALREADY SAID MAY BE SUFFICIENT TO E VINCE WHAT WE UNDERTOOK TO EXPLAIN A

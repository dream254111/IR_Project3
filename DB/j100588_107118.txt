ON VARIOUS KINDS OF NATIVE IRON BY EDWARD HOWARD ESQ F S READ FEBRUARY 25 180O RTIHE CONCORDANCE OF A VARIETY OF FACTS SEEMS TO RENDER IT MOST INDISPUTABLE THAT CERTAIN STONY AND METALLINE SUBSTANCES HAVE AT DIFFERENT PERIODS FALLEN ON THE EARTH WHENCE THEIR ORIGIN OR WHENCE THEY CAME IS YET IN MY JUDGMENT INVOLVED IN COMPLETE OBSCURITY THE ACCOUNTS OF THESE PECULIAR SUBSTANCES IN THE EARLY ANNALS EVEN OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY HAVE UNFORTUNATELY BEEN BLENDED WITH RELATIONS WHICH WE NOW CONSIDER AS FABULOUS AND THE MORE ANCIENT HISTORIES OF STONES FALLEN FROM HEAVEN FROM JUPITER OR FROM THE CLOUDS HAVE EVIDENTLY CONFOUNDED SUCH SUBSTANCES WITH WHAT HAVE BEEN TERMED CERAUNIA BEWTILIA OMBA BRONTIA C NAMES ALTOGETHER UNAPPROPRIATE TO SUBSTANCES FALLEN ON OUR GLOBE INDEED SOME MISLEAD AND OTHERS ARE INEXPRESSIVE THE TERM CERAUNIA BY A MISNOMER DEDUCED FROM ITS SUP POSED ORIGIN SEEMS AS WELL AS BOETILIA TO HAVE BEEN ANCIENTLY USED TO DENOTE MANY SPECIES OF STONES WHICH WERE POLISHED AND SHAPED INTO VARIOUS FORMS THOUGH MOSTLY WEDGELIKE OR TRIANGULAR SOMETIMES AS INSTRUMENTS SOMETIMES AS ORACLES AND SOMETIMES AS DEITIES THE IMPORT OF THE NAMES OMBRIA BRONTIA C SEEMS SUBJECT TO THE SAME UNCERTAINTY IN VERY EARLY AGES IT WAS BELIEVED THAT STONES DID IN REALITY M RCATI METALLOTHECA VATICANA PAGE 24IMR HOWARDS EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS C FALL AS IT WAS SAID FROM HEAVEN OR FROM THE GODS THESE EITHER FROM IGNORANCE OR PERHAPS FROM SUPERSTITIOUS VIEWS WERE CONFOUNDED WITH OTHER STONES WHICH BY THEIR COMPACT AGGREGATION WERE BETTER CALCULATED TO BE SHAPED INTO DIFFERENT INSTRUMENTS AND TO WHICH IT WAS CONVENIENT TO ATTACH A SPECIES OF MYSTERIOUS VENERATION IN MODEM DAYS BECAUSE EXPLOSION AND REPORT HAVE GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED THE DESCENT OF SUCH SUBSTANCES THE NAME OF THUNDERBOLT OR THUNDERSTONE HAS IGNO RANTLY ATTACHED ITSELF TO THEM AND BECAUSE A VARIETY OF SUB STANCES ACCIDENTALLY PRESENT NEAR BUILDINGS AND TREES STRUCK WITH LIGHTNING HAVE WITH THE SAME IGNORANCE BEEN COLLECTED AS THUNDERBOLTS THE THUNDERBOLT AND THE FALLEN METALLINE SUBSTANCE HAVE BEEN RANKED IN THE SAME CLASS OF ABSURDITY CERTAINLY SINCE THE PHENOMENA OF LIGHTNING AND ELECTRICITY HAVE BEEN SO WELL IDENTIFIED THE IDEA OF A THUNDERBOLT IS RIDICULOUS BUT THE EXISTENCE OF PECULIAR SUBSTANCES FALLEN ON THE EARTH I CANNOT HESITATE TO ASSERT AND ON THE CONCORDANCE OF REMOTE AND AUTHENTICATED FACTS I SHALL REST THE ASSERTION MR KING THE LEARNED AUTHOR OF REMARKS CONCERNING STONES SAID TO BAVEFALLEN FROM THE CLOUDS IN THESE DAYS AND IN ANCIENT TIMES HAS ADDUCED QUOTATIONS OF THE GREATEST

ARGILLOFERRU GINOUS AND IS OF OPINION THAT IGNORANCE AND SUPERSTITION HAVE ATTRIBUTED TO IT A MIRACULOUS EXISTENCE AT VARIANCE WITH THE FIRST NOTIONS OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY THE ACCOUNT NEXT IN SUCCESSION IS ALREADY PRINTED IN THE TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY BUT CANNOT BE OMITTED AS IT IMMEDIATELY RELATES TO ONE OF THE SUBSTANCES I HAVE EXAMINED I ALLUDE TO THE LETTER RECEIVED BY SIR WILLIAM HAMILTON FROM THE EARL OF BRISTOL DATED FROM SIENNA JULY 12TH 1794 C IN  THE MIDST OF A MOST VIOLENT THUNDERSTORM ABOUT A DOZENI  STONES OF VARIOUS WEIGHTS AND DIMENSIONS FELL AT THE FEET OF DIFFERENT PERSONS MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN THE STONES ARE OF A QUALITY NOT FOUND IN ANY PART OF THE SIENNESE TERRITORY  THEY FELL ABOUT EIGHTEEN HOURS AFTER THE ENORMOUS ERUPTION OF  MOUNT VESUVIUS WHICH CIRCUMSTANCE LEAVES A CHOICE OF DIF FICULTIES IN THE SOLUTION OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY PHENOMENON  EITHER THESE STONES HAVE BEEN GENERATED IN THIS IGNEOUS MASS  OF CLOUDS WHICH PRODUCED SUCH UNUSUAL THUNDER OR WHICH IS EQUALLY INCREDIBLE THEY WERE THROWN FROM VESUVIUS AT A DISTANCE OF AT LEAST 250 MILES JUDGE THEN OF ITS PARABOLA THE PHILOSOPHERS HERE INCLINE TO THE FIRST SOLUTION I WISH MUCH SIR TO KNOW YOUR SENTIMENTS MY FIRST OBJECTION WAS  TO THE FACT ITSELF BUT OF THIS THERE ARE SO MANY EYE WITNESSES 4 IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE TO WITHSTAND THEIR EVIDENCE PHIL TRANS FOR 1795 P 103 SIR WILLIAM HAMILTON IT SEEMS ALSO RECEIVEDC A PIECE OF ONE OF THE LARGEST STONES WHICH WEIGHED UPWARDS OF FIVE POUNDS AND HAD SEEN ANOTHER WHICH WEIGHED ABOUT ONE HE LIKEWISE OBSERVED THAT THEOUTSIDE OF EVERY STONE WHICH HAD BEEN FOUND AND HAD BEEN ASCERTAINED TO HAVE FALLENA  SEE OURNAL DE PHYSIQUE VENTOSE AN 8 P 6174 MR HOWARDS EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS FROM THE CLOUDS NEAR SIENNA WAS EVIDENTLY FRESHLY VITRIFIED AND WAS BLACK HAVING EVERY SIGN OF HAVING PASSED THROUGH AN EXTREME HEAT THE INSIDE WAS OF A LIGHT GRAY COLOUR MIXED WITH BLACK SPOTS AND SOME SHINING PARTICLES WHICH THE LEARNED THERE HAD DECIDED TO BE PYRITES IN 1796 A STONE WEIGHING 561BS WAS EXHIBITED IN LONDON WITH SEVERAL ATTESTATIONS OF PERSONS WHO ON THE S3TH OF DECEM BER 1795 SAW IT FALL NEAR WOLD COTTAGE IN YORKSHIRE AT ABOUT THREE OCLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON IT HAD PENETRATED THROUGH 12 INCHES OF SOIL AND 6 INCHES OF SOLID CHALK ROCK AND IN BURYING ITSELF HAD THROWN UP AN IMMENSE QUANTITY OF EARTH TO A GREAT DISTANCE AS IT FELL A NUMBER OF EXPLOSIONS WERE HEARD ABOUT AS LOUD AS PISTOLS IN THE ADJACENT VILLAGES THE SOUNDS HEARD WERE TAKEN FORGUNS AT SEA BUT AT TWO ADJOINING VILLAGES WERE SO DISTINCT OF SOME THING SINGULAR PASSING THROUGH THE AIR TOWARDS THE HABITATION OF MR TOPHAM THAT FIVE OR SIX PEOPLE CAME UP TO SEE IF ANY THING EXTRAORDINARY HAD HAPPENED TO HIS HOUSE OR GROUNDS WHEN THE STONE WAS EXTRACTED IT WAS WARM SMOKED AND SMELT VERY STRONGLY OF SULPHUR ITS COURSE AS FAR AS COULD BE COLLECTED FROM DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS WAS FROM THE SOUTHWEST THE DAY WAS MILD AND HAZY A SORT OF WEATHER VERY FREQUENT IN THE WOLD HILLS WHEN THERE ARE NO WINDS OR STORMS BUT THERE WAS NOT ANY THUNDER OR LIGHTNING THE WHOLE DAY NO SUCH STONE IS KNOWN IN THE COUNTRY THERE WAS NO ERUPTION IN THE EARTH AND FROM ITS FORM IT COULD NOT COME FROM ANY BUILDING AND AS THE DAY WAS NOT TEMPESTUOUS IT DID NOT SEEM PROBABLE THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN FORCED FROM ANY ROCKS THE NEAREST OF WHICH ARE THOSE OF HAMBOROUGH HEAD AT A DISTANCE OF TWELVE MILES THE NEAREST VOLCANO I BELIEVE TO BE HECLA IN ICELAND  EXTRACTCD FROM THE PRINTED PAPER DELIVERED AT THE PLACE OF EXHIBITIONON CERTAIN STONY AND METALLINE SUBSTANCES C THE EXHIBITION OF THIS STONE AS A SORT OF SHOW DID NOT TEND TO ACCREDIT THE ACCOUNT OF ITS DESCENT DELIVERED IN A HANDBILL AT THE PLACE OF EXHIBITION MUCH LESS COULD IT CONTRIBUTE TO REMOVE THE OBJECTIONS MADE TO THE FALL OF THE STONES PRESENTED TO THE ROYAL FRENCH ACADEMY BUT THE RIGHT HON PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY EVER ALIVE TO THE INTEREST AND PROMOTION OF SCIENCE OBSERVING THE STONE SO EXHIBITED TO RESEMBLE A STONE SENT TO HIM AS ONE OF THOSE FALLEN AT SIENNA COULD NOT BE MISLED BY PREJUDICE HE OBTAINED A PIECE OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY MASS AND COLLECTED MANY REFERENCES TO DESCRIPTIONS OF SIMILAR PHENOMENA AT LENGTH IN 1799 AN ACCOUNT OF STONES FALLEN IN THE EAST INDIES WAS SENT TO THE PRESIDENT BY JOHN LLOYD WILLIAMS ESQ WHICH BY ITS UNQUESTIONABLE AUTHENTICITY AND BY THE STRIKING RESEMBLANCE IT BEARS TO OTHER ACCOUNTS OF FALLEN STONES MUST REMOVE ALL PREJUDICE MR WILLIAMS HAS SINCE DRAWN UP THE FOLLOWING MORE DETAILED NARRATIVE OF FACTS ACCOUNT OF THE EXPLOSION OF A METEOR NEAR BENARES IN THE EAST INDIES AND OF THE FALLING OF SOME STONES AT THE SAME TIME ABOUT 14 MILES FROM THAT CITY BY JOHN LLOYD WILLIAMS ESQ F R S A CIRCUMSTANCE OF SO EXTRAORDINARY A NATURE AS THE FALL OF STONES FROM THE HEAVENS COULD NOT FAIL TO EXCITE THE WONDER AND ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF EVERY INQUISITIVE MIND AMONG A SUPERSTITIOUS PEOPLE ANY PRETERNATURAL APPEARANCE IS VIEWED WITH SILENT AWE AND REVERENCE ATTRIBUTING THE CAUSES TO THE WILL OF THE SUPREME BEING THEY DO NOT PRESUME TO JUDGE THE MEANS BY WHICH THEY WERE PRODUCED NOR THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH THEY WERE ORDERED  AND WE ARE NATURALLY LED TO SUSPECT THE INFLUENCE OF PREJUDICE AND SUPERSTITION IN THEIR DESCRIPTIONS S75176 MR HOWARDS EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS OF SUCH PHENOMENA MY INQUIRIES WERE THEREFORE CHIEFLY DIRECTED TO THE EUROPEANS WHO WERE BUT THINLY DISPERSED ABOUT THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY THE INFORMATION I OBTAINED WAS THAT ON THE IGTH OF DECEM BER 1798 ABOUT EIGHT OCLOCK IN THE EVENING A VERY LUMINOUS METEOR WAS OBSERVED IN THE HEAVENS BY THE INHABITANTS OF BENARES AND THE PARTS ADJACENT IN THE FORM OF A LARGE BALL OF FIRE THAT IT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A LOUD NOISE RESEMBLING THUNDER AND THAT A NUMBER OF STONES WERE SAID TO HAVE FALLEN FROM IT NEAR KRAKHUT A VILLAGE ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE RIVER GOOMTY ABOUT 14 MILES FROM THE CITY OF BENARES THE METEOR APPEARED IN THE WESTERN PART OF THE HEMISPHERE AND WAS BUT A SHORT TIME VISIBLE IT WAS OBSERVED BY SEVERAL EUROPEANS AS WELL AS NATIVES IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF JUANPOOR ABOUT 12 MILES FROM THE SPOT WHERE THE STONES ARE SAID TO HAVE FALLEN IT WAS VERY DIS TINCTLY OBSERVED BY SEVERAL EUROPEAN GENTLEMEN AND LADIES WHO DESCRIBED IT AS A LARGE BALL OF FIRE ACCOMPANIED WITH A LOUD RUMBLING NOISE NOT UNLIKE AN ILL DISCHARGED PLATOON OF MUS QUETRY IT WAS ALSO SEEN AND THE NOISE HEARD BY VARIOUS PERSONS AT BENARES MR DAVIS OBSERVED THE LIGHT COME INTO THE ROOM WHERE HE WAS THROUGH A GLASS WINDOW SO STRONGLY AS TO PROJECT SHADOWS FROM THE BARS BETWEEN THE PANES ON A DARK COLOURED CARPET VERY DISTINCTLY AND IT APPEARED TO HIM AS LUMINOUS AS THE BRIGHTEST MOONLIGHT WHEN AN ACCOUNT OF THE FALL OF THE STONES REACHED BENARES MR DAVIS THE JUDGE AND MAGISTRATE OF THE DISTRICT SENT AN INTELLIGENT PERSON TO MAKE INQUIRY ON THE SPOT WHEN THE PERSON ARRIVED AT THE VILLAGE NEAR WHICH THE STONES WERE SAID TO HAVE FALLEN THE NATIVES IN ANSWER TO HIS INQUIRIES TOLD HIM THAT THEYON CERTAIN STONY A7D METALLINE SUBSTANCES C HAD EITHER BROKEN TO PIECES OR GIVEN AWAY TO THE TESSELDAR NATIVE COLLECTOR AND OTHERS ALL THAT THEY HAD PICKED UP BUT THAT HE MIGHT EASILY FIND SOME IN THE ADJACENT FIELDS WHERE THEY WOULD BE READILY DISCOVERED THE CROPS BEING THEN NOT ABOVE TWO OR THREE INCHES ABOVE THE GROUND BY OBSERVING WHERE THE EARTH APPEARED RECENTLY TURNED UP FOLLOWING THESE DIRECTIONS HE FOUND FOUR WHICH HE BROUGHT TO MR DAVIS MOST OF THESE THE FORCE OF THE FALL HAD BURIED ACCORDING TO A MEASURE HE PRODUCED ABOUT SIX INCHES DEEP IN FIELDS WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN RECENTLY WATERED AND IT APPEARED FROM THE MANS DESCRIPTION THAT THEY MUST HAVE LAIN AT THE DISTANCE OF ABOUT A HUNDRED YARDS FROM EACH OTHER WHAT HE FURTHER LEARNT FROM THE INHABITANTS OF THE VILLAGE CONCERNING THE PHENOMENON WAS THAT ABOUT EIGHT OCLOCK IN THE EVENING WHEN RETIRED TO THEIR HABITATIONS THEY OBSERVED A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT PROCEEDING AS FROM THE SKY ACCOMPANIED WITH A LOUD CLAP OF THUNDER WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY THE NOISE OF HEAVY BODIES FALLING IN THE VICINITY UNCERTAIN WHETHER SOME OF THEIR DEITIES MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN CONCERNED IN THIS OCCURRENCE THEY DID NOT VENTURE OUT TO INQUIRE INTO IT UNTIL THE NEXT MORNING WHEN THE FIRST CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH ATTRACTED THEIR ATTENTION WAS THE APPEARANCE OF THE EARTH BEING TURNED UP IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THEIR FIELDS AS BEFORE MENTIONED WHERE ON EXAMIINIG THEY FOUND THE STONES THE ASSISTANT TO THE COLLECTOR OF THE DISTRICT MR ERSKINE A VERY INTELLIGENT YOUNG GENTLEMAN ON SEEING ONE OF THE STONES BROUGHT TO HIM BY THE NATIVE SUPERINTENDANT OF THE COLLECTIONS WAS ALSO INDUCED TO SEND A PERSON TO THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY TO MAKE INQUIRY WHO RETURNED WITH SEVERAL OF THE STONES AND BROUGHT AN ACCOUNT SIMILAR TO THAT GIVEN BY THE PERSON SENT BY MR DAVIS TOGETHER WITH A CONFIRMATION OF IT FROM THE CAUZY MDCCCII A A 177178 MR HOWARDS EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS WHO HAD BEEN DIRECTED TO MAKE THE INQUIRY UNDER HIS HAND AND SEAL MR MACLANE A GENTLEMAN WHO RESIDED VERY NEAR THE VILLAGE OF KRAKHUT GAVE ME PART OF A STONE THAT HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO HIM THE MORNING AFTER THE APPEARANCE OF THE PHENOMENON BY THE WATCHMAN WHO WAS ON DUTY AT HIS HOUSE THIS HE SAID HAD FALLEN THROUGH THE TOP OF HIS HUT WHICH WAS CLOSE BY AND BURIED ITSELF SEVERAL INCHES IN THE FLOOR WHICH WAS OF CONSOLI DATED EARTH THE STONE MUST BY HIS ACCOUNT PREVIOUS TO ITS HAVING BEEN BROKEN HAVE WEIGHED UPWARDS OF TWO POUNDS AT THE TIME THE METEOR APPEARED THE SKY WAS PERFECTLY SERENE NOT THE SMALLEST VESTIGE OF A CLOUD HAD BEEN SEEN SINCE THE XI TH OF THE MONTH NOR WERE ANY OBSERVED FOR MANY DAYS AFTER OF THESE STONES I HAVE SEEN EIGHT NEARLY PERFECT BESIDES PARTS OF SEVERAL OTHERS WHICH HAD BEEN BROKEN BY THE POSSESSORS TO DISTRIBUTE AMONG THEIR FRIENDS THE FORM OF THE MORE PERFECT ONES APPEARED TO BE THAT OF AN IRREGULAR CUBE ROUNDED OFF AT THE EDGES BUT THE ANGLES WERE TO BE OBSERVED ON MOST OF THEM THEY WERE OF VARIOUS SIZES FROM ABOUT THREE TO UPWARDS OF FOUR INCHES IN THEIR LARGEST DIAMETER ONE OF THEM MEASURING FOUR INCHES AND A QUARTER WEIGHED TWO POUNDS TWELVE OUNCES IN APPEARANCE THEY WERE EXACTLY SIMILAR EXTERNALLY THEY WERE COVERED WITH A HARD BLACK COAT OR INCRUSTATION WHICH IN SOME PARTS HAD THE APPEARANCE OF VARNISH OR BITUMEN AND ON MOST OF THEM WERE FRACTURES WHICH FROM THEIR BEING COVERED WITH A MATTER SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE COAT SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE FALL BY THE STONES STRIKING AGAINST EACH OTHER AND TO HAVE PASSED THROUGH SOME MEDIUM PROBABLY AN INTENSE HEAT PRE VIOUS TO THEIR REACHING THE EARTH INTERNALLY THEY CONSISTED OF A NUMBER OF SMALL SPHERICAL BODIES OF A SLATE COLOUR EMBEDDEDON CERTAIN STONY AND METALLINE SUBSTANCES C IN A WHITISH GRITTY SUBSTANCE INTERSPERSED WITH BRIGHT SHINING SPICULAE OF A METALLIC OR PYRITICAL NATURE THE SPHERICAL BODIES WERE MUCH HARDER THAN THE REST OF THE STONE THE WHITE GRITTY PART READILY CRUMBLED ON BEING RUBBED WITH A HARD BODY AND ON BEING BROKEN A QUANTITY OF IT ATTACHED ITSELF TO THE MAGNET BUT MORE PARTICULARLY THE OUTSIDE COAT OR CRUST WHICH APPEARED ALMOST WHOLLY ATTRACTABLE BY IT AS TWO OF THE MORE PERFECT STONES WHICH I HAD OBTAINED AS WELL AS PARTS OF SOME OTHERS HAVE BEEN EXAMINED BY SEVERAL GENTLEMEN WELL VERSED IN MINERALOGY AND CHEMISTRY I SHALL NOT ATTEMPT ANY FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF THEIR CONSTITUENT PARTS NOR SHALL I OFFER ANY CONJECTURE RESPECTING THE FORMATION OF SUCH SINGULAR PRODUCTIONS OR EVEN RECORD THOSE WHICH I HAVE HEARD OF OTHERS BUT LEAVE THE WORLD TO DRAW THEIR OWN INFERENCES FROM THE FACTS ABOVE RELATED I SHALL ONLY OBSERVE THAT IT IS WELL KNOWN THERE ARE NO VOLCANOS ON THE CONTINENT OF INDIA AND AS FAR AS I CAN LEARN NO STONES HAVE BEEN MET WITH IN THE EARTH IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD WHICH BEAR THE SMALLEST RESEM BLANCE TO THOSE ABOVE DESCRIBED IT REMAINS FOR ME TO SPEAK OF A SUBSTANCE MENTIONED IN THE

IRON WAS INDUCED TO SEARCH THE COLLECTION OF BORN WHERE HE DISCOVERED THE VERY SUBSTANCE ASSERTED TO HAVE FALLEN ON THE 3D OF JULY 1753 HOW FAR THESE FOUR SUBSTANCES HAVE RESEM BLANCE TO EACH OTHER IT WILL SOON APPEAR NOT TO BE MY PROVINCE TO ANTICIPATE THE PRESIDENT HAVING DONE ME THE HONOUR TO SUBMIT HIS SPECIMENS OF THE YORKSHIRE AND ITALIAN STONES TO MY EXAMINA TION I BECAME INDEBTED TO MR GREVILLE AND MR WILLIAMS FOR A SIMILAR DISTINCTION AND BEING THUS POSSESSED OF FOUR SUBSTANCES TO ALL OF WHICH THE SAME ORIGIN HAD BEEN ATTRIBUTED THE NECESSITY OF DESCRIBING THEM MINERALOGICALLY DID NOT FAIL TO PRESENT ITSELF TO EXECUTE THIS TASK NO ONE COULD BE MORE EAGER AND CERTAINLY NO ONE BETTER QUALIFIED THAN THE COUNT DE BOURNON HE HAS VERY OBLIGINGLY FAVOURED ME WITH THE FOL LOWING DESCRIPTIONS MINERALOGICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE VARIOUS STONES SAID TO HAVE FALLEN UPON THE EARTH BY THE COUNT DE BOURNON F R S THE STONES I AM ABOUT TO DESCRIBE ARE NOT OF ANY REGULAR SHAPE AND THOSE

CESTAIN STONY AND METALLINE SUBSTANCES C WISE WERE ENTIRELY COVERED WITH A BLACK CRUST THE THICKNESS OF WHICH WAS VERY INCONSIDERABLE THE STONES WHICH FELL AT BENARES ARE THOSE OF WHICH THE MINERALOGICAL CHARACTERS ARE THE MOST STRIKING I SHALL THEREFORE BEGIN THE FOLLOWING DESCRIPTION WITH THEM AND SHALL AFTERWARDS MAKE USE OF THEM AS OBJECTS OF COMPARISON IN DESCRIBING THE OTHERS STONES FROM BENARES THESE STONES AS WELL AS THE OTHERS DESCRIBED IN THIS PAPER WHATEVER MAY BE THEIR SIZE ARE COVERED OVER THE WHOLE EXTENT OF THEIR SURFACE WITH A THIN CRUST OF A DEEP BLACK COLOUR THEY HAVE NOT THE SMALLEST GLOSS AND THEIR SURFACE IS SPRINKLED OVER WITH SMALL ASPERITIES WHICH CAUSE IT TO FEEL IN SOME MEASURE LIKE SHAGREEN OR FISH SKIN WHEN THESE STONES ARE BROKEN SO AS TO SHEW THEIR INTERNAL APPEARANCE THEY ARE FOUND TO BE OF A GRAYISH ASH COLOUR AND OF A GRANULATED TEXTURE VERY SIMILAR TO THAT OF A COARSE GRIT STONE THEY APPEAR EVIDENTLY TO BE COMPOSED OF FOUR DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES WHICH MAY BE EASILY DISTINGUISHED BY MAKING USE OF A LENS ONE OF THESE SUBSTANCES WHICH IS IN GREAT ABUNDANCE APPEARS IN THE FORM OF SMALL BODIES SOME OF WHICH ARE PERFECTLY GLO BULAR OTHERS RATHER ELONGATED OR ELLIPTICAL THEY ARE OF VARIOUS SIZES FROM THAT OF A SMALL PINS HEAD TO THAT OF A PEA OR NEARLY SO SOME OF THEM HOWEVER BUT VERY FEW ARE OF A LARGER SIZE THE COLOUR OF THESE SMALL GLOBULES IS GRAY SOMETIMES INCLINING VERY MUCH TO BROWN AND THEY ARE COMPLETELY OPAQUE THEY MAY WITH GREAT EASE BE BROKEN IN ALL DIRECTIONS TLEIR FRACTURE IS CONCHOID AND SHEWS A FINE SMOOTH COMPACT182 MR HOWAIDS EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS GRAIN HAVING A SMALL DEGREE OF LUSTRE RESEMBLING IN SOME MEASURE THAT OF ENAMEL THEIR HARDNESS IS SUCH THAT BEING RUBBED UPON GLASS THEY ACT UPON IT IN A SLIGHT DEGREE THIS ACTION IS SUFFICIENT TO TAKE OFF ITS POLISH BUT NOT TO CUT IT THEY GIVE FAINT SPARKS WHEN STRUCK WITH STEEL ANOTHER OF THESE SUBSTANCES IS A MARTIAL PYRITES OF AN INDE TERMINATE FORM ITS COLOUR IS A REDDISH YELLOW SLIGHTLY INCLINING TO THE COLOUR OF NICKEL OR TO THAT OF ARTIFICIAL PYRITES THE TEXTURE OF THIS SUBSTANCE IS GRANULATED AND NOT VERY STRONGLY CONNECTED WHENPOWDERED IT IS OF A BLACK COLOUR THIS PYRITES IS NOT ATTRACTABLE BY THE MAGNET AND IS IRREGULARLY DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE SUBSTANCE OF THE STONE THE THIRD OF THESE SUBSTANCES CONSISTS IN SMALL PARTICLES OF IRON IN A PERFECTLY METALLIC STATE SO THAT THEY MAY EASILY BE FLATTENED OR EXTENDED BY MEANS OF A HAMMER THESE PARTICLES GIVE TO THE WHOLE MASS OF THE STONE THE PROPERTY OF BEING ATTRACTABLE BY THE MAGNET THEY ARE HOWEVER IN LESS PROPOR TION THAN THOSE OF PYRITES JUST MENTIONED WHEN A PIECE OF THE STONE WAS POWDERED AND THE PARTICLES OF IRON SEPARATED FROM IT AS ACCURATELY AS POSSIBLE BY MEANS OF A MAGNET THEY APPEARED TO COMPOSE ABOUT T OF THE WHOLE WEIGHT OF THE STONE THE THREE SUBSTANCES JUST DESCRIBED ARE UNITED TOGETHER BY MEANS OF A FOURTH WHICH IS NEARLY OF AN EARTHY CONSISTENCE FOR THIS REASON IT IS EASY TO SEPARATE WITH THE POINT OF A KNIFE OR EVEN WITH THE NAIL THE LITTLE GLOBULAR BODIES ABOVE MENTIONED OR ANY OTHER OF THE CONSTITUENT PARTS OF THE STONE WE MAY WISH TO OBTAIN INDEED THE STONE ITSELF MAY READILY BE BROKEN MERELY BY THE ACTION OF THE FINGERS THE COLOUR OF THIS FOURTH SUBSTANCE WHICH SERVES AS A KIND OF CEMENT TO UNITE THE OTHERS IS A WHITISH GRAYON CERTAIN STOV Y AND METALIWE SUBSTANCES C THE BLACK CRUST WITH WHICH THE SURFACE OF THE STONE IS COATED ALTHOUGH IT IS OF NO GREAT THICKNESS EMITS BRIGHT SPARKS WHEN STRUCK WITH STEEL IT MAY BE BROKEN BY A STROKE WITH A HAMMER AND SEEMS TO POSSESS THE SAME PROPERTIES AS THE VERY ATTRACTABLE BLACK OXIDE OF IRON THIS CRUST IS HOWEVER LIKE THE SUBSTANCE OF THE STONE HERE AND THERE MIXED WITH SMALL PARTICLES OF IRON IN THE METALLIC STATE THEY MAY EASILY BE MADE VISIBLE BY PASSING A FILE OVER THE CRUST AS THEY THEN BECOME EVIDENT ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR METALLIC LUSTRE THIS IS MORE PARTICULARLY THE CASE WITH RESPECT TO THE CRUST OF THOSE STONES WHICH REMAIN TO BE MEN TIONED THEY BEING MUCH MORE RICH IN IRON THAN THAT I HAVE JUST DESCRIBED A CIRCUMSTANCE I THINK IT NEEDLESS TO REPEAT IN THE FOLLOWING DESCRIPTIONS OF THEM THE STONE NOW TREATED OF DOES NOT WHEN BREATHED UPON EMIT AN ARGILLACEOUS SMELL THE SAME REMARK MAY BE APPLIED TO ALL THE OTHERS THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF THIS STONE IS 3352 STONE FROM YORKSHIRE THIS STONE THE CONSTITUENT PARTS OF WHICH ARE EXACTLY THE SAME AS THOSE OF THE STONES FROM BENARES DIFFERS FROM THEM HOWEVER FIRST IN HAVING A FINER GRAIN SECONDLY THAT THE SUBSTANCE DESCRIBED AS BEING IN THE FORM OF SMALL GLOBULAR OR ELLIPTICAL BODIES IS NOT SO CONSTANTLY IN THOSE FORMS BUT IS ALSO FOUND IN PARTICLES OF AN IRREGULAR SHAPE A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT IS NOT MET WITH IN THE OTHER STONES THESE BODIES ARE LIKEWISE IN GENERAL OF A SMALLER SIZE THIRDLY THE PROPORTION OF MARTIAL PYRITES WHICH HAS PRE CISELY THE SAME CHARACTERS AS THAT IN THE STONES FROM BENARES IS LESS ON THE CONTRARY THAT OF THE IRON IN A METALLIC STATE IS MUCH GREATER THE QUANTITY I WAS ABLE TO SEPARATE BY MEANS 183184 AMIR HOWARDS EXPERIMENTS AZD OBSERVATIONS OF THE MAGNET APPEARED TO ME TO COMPOSE ABOUT EIGHT OR NINE PARTS IN ONE HUNDRED OF THE WEIGHT OF THE WHOLE MASS I OBSERVED MANY PIECES OF THIS IRON OF A PRETTY CONSIDERABLE SIZE ONE OF THEM TAKEN FROM A PORTION OF THE STONE I HAD POWDERED IN ORDER TO SEPARATE THE IRON WEIGIHED SEVERAL GRAINS THE PART OF THE STONE WHICH IS IN AN EARTHY STATE AND WHICH SERVES TO CONNECT THE OTHER PARTS TOGETHER HAS RATHER MORE CONSISTENCE THAN THAT OF THE PRECEDING STONES AND ITS APPEARANCE DOES NOT DIFFER MUCH FROM THAT OF DECOMPOSED FELSPAR OR KAOLIN THE STONE ITSELF THEREFORE ALTHOUGH BY NO MEANS HARD IS RATHER MORE DIFFICULT TO BREAK WITH THE FINGERS THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF THIS STONE IS 3508 STONE FROM ITALY THIS STONE WAS IN A PERFECTLY ENTIRE STATE CONSEQUENTLY ITS WHOLE SURFACE WAS COVERED OVER WITH THE BLACK CRUST PECULIAR TO ALL STONES OF THIS KIND AS THE STONE WAS OF A VERY SMALL SIZE IT BECAME NECESSARY TO SACRIFICE THE WHOLE OF IT TO THE INVESTI GATION OF ITS NATURE ITS GRAIN WAS COARSE SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE STONES FROM BENARES IN IT MIGHT BE PERCEIVED THE SAME GRAY GLOBULAR BODIES THE SAME KIND OF MARTIAL PYRITES AND THE SAME PARTICLES OF IRON IN THE METALLIC STATE THE PROPORTION OF THESE LAST WAS MUCH LESS THAN IN THE STONE FROM YORKSHIRE BUT RATHER GREATER THAN IN THE STONES FROM BENARES THE SAME KIND OF GRAY EARTHY SUBSTANCE SERVED TO CONNECT THE DIFFERENT PARTS TOGETHER AND NOTHING MORE COULD BE PERCEIVED EXCEPT A FEW GLOBULES WHICH CONSISTED WHOLLY OF BLACK OXIDE OF IRON ATTRACTABLE BY THE MAGNET AND ONE SINGLE GLOBULE OF ANOTHER SUBSTANCE WHICH APPEARED TO DIFFER FROM ALL THOSE WE HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED THIS LAST SUBSTANCE HAD A PERFECTLY VITREOUS LUSTRE AND WAS COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT IT WAS OF A PALE YELLOWON CERTAIN STONY AND METALLINE SUBSTANCES C 185 COLOUR SLIGHTLY INCLINING TO GREEN AND ITS HARDNESS WAS RATHER INFERIOR TO THAT OF CALCAREOUS SPAR THE QUANTITY OF IT HOWEVER WAS TOO SMALL TO BE SUBMITTED TO SUCH AN INVESTIGATION AS MIGHT HAVE DETERMINED ITS NATURE THE BLACK CRUST WHICH COVERED THE STONE WAS RATHER THINNER THAN THAT OF THE STONES ALREADY DESCRIBED AND SEEMED TO HAVE UNDERGONE A KIND OF CONTRACTION WHICH HAD PRODUCED IN IT A NUMBER OF FISSURES OR FURROWS THEREBY TRACING UPON THE SURFACE THE APPEARANCE OF COMPART MENTS SIMILAR IN SOME MEASURE TO WHAT IS OBSERVED IN THE STONES CALLED SEPTARIA THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF THIS STONE WAS 34I8 STONE FROM BOHEMIA THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THIS STONE IS VERY SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE STONE FROM YORKSHIRE ITS GRAIN IS FINER THAN THAT OF THE STONES FROM BENARES IN IT MAY BE OBSERVED THE SAME GRAY SUB STANCE BOTH IN SMALL GLOBULES AND IN PARTICLES OF AN IRREGULAR SHAPE ALSO THE SAME PARTICLES OF METALLIC IRON THE SAME KIND OF EARTHY SUBSTANCE LIKEWISE SERVED TO CONNECT THE OTHER PARTS TOGETHER THIS STONE HOWEVER DIFFERS MATERIALLY FROM THE OTHERS FIRST THE PARTICLES OF PYRITES CANNOT BE SEEN WITHOUT A LENS SECONDLY IT CONTAINS A MUCH LARGER QUANTITY OF IRON IN THE MNETALLIC STATE INSOMUCH THAT THE PROPORTION OF THAT METAL SEPARATED FROM IT BY MEANS OF THE MAGNET AMOUNTED TO ABOUT S OF THE WEIGHT OF THE WHOLE THIS STONE HAS ALSO OWING PERHAPS TO ITS HAVING REMAINED A MUCH LONGER TIME IN THE EARTH THAN THE PRECEDING ONES ALL OF WHICH WERE TAKEN UP NEARLY AT THE VERY INSTANT OF THEIR FALL ANOTHER DIFFERENCE VIZ MANY OF THE PARTICLES OF IRON IN A XD CCCI B BI86 MR HOWARDS EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERATIONS METALLIC STATE HAVE UNDERGONE AN OXIDIZEMENT AT THEIR SURFACE A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT HAS PRODUCED A GREAT NUMBER OF SPOTS OF A YELLOWISH BROWN COLOUR AND VERY NEAR TO EACH OTHER OVER A PART OF ITS INTERNAL SUBSTANCE THIS OXIDIZEMENT BY ADDING TO THE BULK AND TO THE FORCE OF ACTION OF THE PART WE HAVE DESCRIBED AS SERVING BY WAY OF CEMENT TO THE OTHER CONSTITUENT PARTS OF THE STONE HAS OCCASIONED A GREATER DEGREE OF ADHESION BETWEEN THESE PARTS AND HAS RENDERED THE SUBSTANCE OF THE STONE MORE COMPACT THE GREAT QUANTITY OF IRON IN A METALLIC STATE WHICH THIS STONE CONTAINS ADDED TO ITS GREATER COMPACTNESS MAKES IT CAPABLE OF RECEIVING A SLIGHT DEGREE OF POLISH WHEREAS IT IS IM POSSIBLE TO GIVE ANY POLISH TO THE OTHERS WHEN POLISHED THE IRON BECOMES VERY EVIDENT IN THE POLISHED PART APPEARING IN THE FORM OF SMALL SPECKS ALMOST CLOSE TO EACH OTHER WHICH HAVE THE COLOUR AND LUSTRE PECULIAR TO THAT METAL THESE SPECKS ARE IN GENERAL NEARLY OF AN EQUAL SIZE THE BLACK CRUST OF THIS STONE IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE OTHERS THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF THE STONE IS 4281 IT IS EASY TO PERCEIVE FROM THE FOREGOING DESCRIPTION THAT THESE STONES ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE NOT THE SMALLEST ANALOGY WITH ANY OF THE MINERAL SUBSTANCES ALREADY KNOWN EITHER OF A VOLCANIC OR ANY OTHER NATURE HAVE A VERY PECULIAR AND STRIKING ANALOGY WITH EACH OTHER THIS CIRCUMSTANCE RENDERS THEM TRULY WORTHY TO ENGAGE THE ATTENTION OF PHILOSOPHERS AND NATURALLY EXCITES A DESIRE OF KNOWING TO WHAT CAUSES THEY OWE THEIR EXISTENCE I PROCEED TO CONSIDER THE ASSISTANCE TO BE DERIVED FROM CHEMISTRY IN DISTINGUISHING THESE STONES FROM ALL OTHER KNOWNON CERTAIN STONY AND MNETALLINE SUBSTANCES CO I87 SUBSTANCES AND IN ESTABLISHING THE ASSERTION THAT THEY HAVE FALLEN ON THE EARTH THE ANALYSIS MADE BY THE FRENCH ACADEMICIANS OF THE STONE PRESENTED TO THEM BY THE ABB6 BACHELAY WAS IN PART CONDUCTED BY THE EVER TO BE DEPLORED LAVOISIER BUT IT WAS PERFORMED BEFORE THAT CELEBRATED AUTHOR HAD ENRICHED CHEMISTRY WITH HIS LAST DISCOVERIES AND BEFORE HE HAD GIVEN BIRTH TO THE SYSTEM UNDER WHICH IT FLOURISHES THE RESULT OF THIS ANALYSIS MIGHT WELL INDUCE THE CONCLUSION THAT THE SUBJECT OF IT WAS COMMON PYRITICAL MATTER IT WAS UNFORTUNATELY MADE OF AN AGGREGATE PORTION OF THE STONE AND NOT OF EACH DISTINCT SUBSTANCE IRREGULARLY DISSEMINATED THROUGH IT THE PROPORTIONS OBTAINED WERE CONSEQUENTLY AS ACCIDENTAL AS THE ARRANGEMENT OF EVERY SUBSTANCE IN THE MASS THE ANALYSIS OF M BARTHOLD OF THE STONE OF ENSISHEINM IS SUBJECT TO THE SAME OBJECTIONS BUT AFTER HAVING THE ADVANTAGE OF THE FOREGOING DESCRIPTIONS THE RESEARCHES WHICH FOLLOW CANNOT BE SUPPOSED ALTOGETHER LIABLE TO A SIMILAR FATALITY EXAMINATION OF TIHE STONE FROM BENARES THIS STONE AS THE COUNT DE BOURNOL HAS ALREADY RE MARKED HAS THE MOST DISTINGUISHED CHARACTERS INDEED IT IS THE ONLY ONE OF THE FOUR SUFFICIENTLY PERFECT IF I BE ALLOWED THAT EXPRESSION TO BE SUBJECTED TO ANY THING APPROACHING TO A REGULAR ANALYSIS THE CRUST OR EXTERNAL BLACK COVERING IS THE FIRST SUBSTANCE TO WHICH THE ATTENTION IS NATURALLY DIRECTED WHEN A PORTION OF THIS CRUST HAD BEEN DETACHED WITH A KNIFE OR A FILE AND FINELY PULVERIZED I SEPARATED THE PARTICLES ATTRACTABLE BY A MAGNET B B B188 MR HOWARDS EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS AND DIGESTED THE UNATTRACTABLE PORTION WITH NITRIC ACID WHICH WAS PRESENTLY DECOMPOSED BUT OWING TO A STRONG ADHERENCE OF SOME OF THE INTERIOR AND EARTHY PARTS OF THE STONE IT DID NOT DISENTANGLE THE COATING OR METALLINE PART WITHOUT SOME DIFFICULTY THE ACID BEING SUFFICIENTLY NEUTRALIZED THE SOLUTION WAS PASSED THROUGH A FILTRE AND SATURATED TO EXCESS WITH AMMONIA AN ABUNDANT PRECIPITATE OF OXIDE OF IRON WAS PRODUCED AND WHEN THIS OXIDE WAS SEPARATED I OBSERVED THE SALINE LIQUOR TO HAVE A GREENISH COLOUR I EVAPORATED IT TO DRYNESS AND REDISSOLVED THE DRY SALT IN DISTILLED WATER NO PRECIPITATE WAS FORMED DURING THE EVAPORATION NOR WAS THE COLOUR OF THE SOLUTION ENTIRELY DESTROYED IT APPEARED TO ME LIKE A TRIPLE SALT DESCRIBED BY MR HIERMSTADT AS AN AMMONIACAL NITRATE OF NICKEL BY EXAMI NATION WITH PRUSSIATE OF AMMONIA IT YIELDED A WHITISH PRECIPITATE INCLINING TO A VIOLET COLOUR AND BY VARIOUS PROPERTIES I WAS SOON CONFIRMED IN THE OPINION THAT NICKEL WAS PRESENT SINCE I SHALL HAVE OCCASION MORE THAN ONCE TO TREAT OF THE TRIPLE COMPOUND AND SINCE IT HAS BEEN ONLY MENTIONED BY MR HERMSTADT IT IS NECESSARY NOW TO DETAIL SOME OF ITS DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERS THE SAME CHEMIST INFORMS US THAT THE THREE MINERAL ACIDS WITH AMMONIA ENTER INTO SIMILAR COMBINATIONS WITH NICKEL AND I HAVE OBSERVED THAT OXIDE OF NICKEL CAN BE DISSOLVED BY NITRATE AND MURIATE OF AMMONIA THE MURIATE SEEMS TO TAKE UP THE LARGEST QUANTITY THE COLOUR OF THIS SALT IS BY NO MEANS UNIFORM IT IS SOMETIMES GRASS GREEN VIOLET ROSE COLOUR INCLINING TO PURPLE AND I HAVE SEEN IT ALMOST COLOURLESS IT SEEMS TO BE PURPLE AND TO INCLINE TO ROSE COLOUR AND VIOLET WHEN ALL THE OXIDE OF NICKEL IS NOT UNITED TO BOTH ACID AND ALKALI BUT FROM THE DEFICIENCY OF SALT IS HELD IN SOLUTION BY AN  NNALES DE CBIMIE TOM XXII P XOS0ON CERTAIN STONY AND METALIZTE SUBSTANCES C EXCESS OF AMMONIA IN THIS CASE EVAPORATION OF COURSE PRE CIPITATES THE NICKEL IN THE STATE OF OXIDE WHICH IS OF A WHITISH GREEN COLOUR THE NICKEL CANNOT BE PRECIPITATED FROM A PERFECTLY FORMED TRIPLE SALT BY ANY REAGENT I HAVE TRIED EXCEPT BY A PRUSSIATE OR A HYDROGENIZED SULPHURET OF AMMONIA POTASH AND LIME AS WELL AS I PRESUME OTHER BODIES STANDING IN THE ORDER OF AFFINITIES BEFORE AMMONIA DECOMPOSE THE SALT BUT THE NICKEL IS THEN CONTINUED IN SOLUTION BY THE DISENGAGED AMMONIA AS IT MAY BE IMAGINED THAT I HAVE OCCASIONALLY MET WITH COPPER WHEN I DESCRIBE A VIOLET OR PURPLE AMMONIACAL SOLUTION IT IS RIGHT TO OBSERVE THAT TO AVOID THIS ERROR I HAVE EITHER REDUCED THE LIQUOR TO A NEUTRAL STATE AND ENDEAVOURED WITHOUT SUCCESS TO OBTAIN FROM IT A PRECIPITATE WITH A SOLUTION OF SUL PHURETED HYDROGEN GAS OR BY ADDING ANT ACID TO SLIGHT EXCESS AND IMMERSING A PIECE OF IRON I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DETECT A TRACE OF COPPER THESE AND MANY OTHER TRIALS WHEN THEY DO NOT APPEAR TO BE MADE BEFORE THE ESTIMATION OF THE QUANTITIES OF NICKEL HAVE BEEN CONSTANTLY MADE AFTERWARDS BUT TO RETURN TO THE INCRUSTATION OR COATING OF THE STONE THE DECOMPOSITION OF THE NITRIC ACID SHEWED THE PRESENCE OF MATTER AT LEAST NEARLY METALLIC ALTHOUGH NOT ATTRACTABLE AND THE EXA MINATIONS MADE OF THE LIQUOR FROM WHICH THE IRON WAS PRECIPI TATED ASCERTAINED THE PRESENCE OF NICKEL BEYOND DISPUTE THE DIFFICULTY OF OBTAINING THE COATING OF THE STONE EITHER DISTINCT FROM MATTER NOT BELONGING TO IT OR IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITY INDUCED ME TO RELINQUISH THE IDEA OF ATTEMPTING TO GIVE THE PROPORTIONS OF ITS CONSTITUENT PARTS THE STONE BEING DEPRIVED OF ITS COVERING THE SHINING PARTICLES IRREGULARLY DISSEMINATED NEXT DEMAND EXAMINATION I FIRST 189190 MR HOWARDS EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS EXAMINED THE PYRITES THEIR VERY LOOSE TEXTURE MADE IT EX CEEDINGLY DIFFICULT TO COLLECT THE WEIGHT OF 16 GRAINS WHICH WAS HOWEVER EFFECTED BY THE DEXTERITY OF THE COUNT DE BOURNON I DIGESTED THESE AT A LOW HEAT WITH WEAK MURIATIC ACID WHICH ACTED GRADUALLY AND DISENGAGED A TRIFLING BUT SENSIBLE QUANTITY OF SULPHURETED HYDROGEN GAS AFTER SEVERAL HOURS I FOUND THE ACID DISCONTINUED ITS ACTION THE WHOLE METALLINE PART APPEARED IN SOLUTION BUT SULPHUR AND EARTHY PARTICLES WERE OBSERVABLE THE SULPHUR FROM ITS SMALL SPECIFIC GRAVITY WAS SUSPENDED THROUGH THE SOLUTION WHILST THE EARTHY MATTER WHICH COULD NOT BE SEPARATED BY MECHANICAL MEANA WAS FORTUNATELY LEFT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DIGESTING VESSEL I DECANTED OFF THE SOLUTION HOLDING SUSPENDED THE SULPHUR AND BY REPEATED WASHING SEPARATED EVERY THING BELONGING TO THE PYRITES FROM THE INSOLUBLE EARTHY MATTER THE SUBTRACTION OF WHICH REDUCED THE WEIGHT OF REAL PYRITES TO 14 GRAINS I NEXT OBTAINED THE SULPHUR BY FILTRATION WHEN IT WAS AS DRY AS I COULD MAKE IT WITHOUT FEAR OF ITS BEING SUBLIMED ITS WEIGHT WAS TWO GRAINS TO THE FILTRATED LIQUOR I ADDED NITRATE OF BARYTES BY WAY OF DETECTING ANY SULPHURIC ACID WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN PRESENT BUT NO CLOUDINESS ENSUED I THEN SEPARATED BY SULPHATE OF AMMONIA THE BARYTES THUS ADDED AND PRECIPITATED THE IRON WITH AMMONIA THE LIQUOR ON THE SUBSIDENCE OF OXIDE OF IRON APPEARED OF A VIOLET PURPLE COLOUR IT CONTAINED NICKEL WHICH I THREW DOWN ITH SULPHURETED HYDROGEN GAS THERE BEING ALREADY A SUFFICIENT EXCESS OF AMMONIA IN THE SALINE LIQUOR TO FORM AN ALKALINE HYDROGENIZEIED SULPHURET THE OXIDE OF IRON AFTER IGNITION WEIGHED I 5 GRAINS AND THE SULPHURET OF NICKEL REDUCED TO AN OXIDE WEIGHED AFTER THE SAME TREATMENT SOMETHIIG MORE THAN ONE GRAIN THE PROPORTIOTS OF THE SUBSTANCES CONTAINED IN THEON CERTAIN STONY AND METALLINE SUBSTANCES C PYRITES OF THE STONE FROM BENARES MAY THEREFORE BE CONSIDERED NEARLY THUS GRAINS SULPHUR 2  IROLN   O SINCE 15 GRAINS OF THE OXIDE REPRESENT ABOUT THAT QUAN TITY OF IRON NICKEL NEARLY   L EXTRANEOUS EARTHY MATTER  5I IT IS OBSERVABLE THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THE LOSS APPEARS TO BE ONLY HALF A GRAIN IT WAS PROBABLY MORE BECAUSE THE SULPHUR COULD NOT BE REDUCED TO THE SAME STATE OF DRYNESS IN WHICH IT EXISTED WHEN IN COMBINATION WITH THE IRON NOT TO SAY THAT IT WAS IN A SMALL DEGREE VOLATILIZED WITH THE HYDROGEN GAS DIS ENGAGED DURING THE SOLUTION THE WEIGHT OF NICKEL IS A MERE ESTIMATION WE ARE NOT YET SUFFICIENTLY ACQUAINTED WITH THAT METAL TO SPEAK OF IT WITH ACCURACY EXCEPT AS TO ITS PRESENCE UPON THE WHOLE HOWEVER IT MAY BE CONCLUDED THAT THESE PYRITES ARE OF A VERY PARTICULAR NATURE FOR ALTHOUGH HENKEL HAS OBSERVED THAT SULPHUR MAY BE SEPARATED FROM PYRITES BY MURIATIC ACID IT IS BY NO MEANS THE USUAL HABITUDE OF PYRITES TO BE OF SUCH EASY DECOMPOSITION THE OTHER SHINING PARTICLES IMMEDIATELY SEEN WHEN THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE STONE IS EXPOSED ARE THE MALLEABLE IRON BEFORE I STATE THE EXAMINATION OF THIS IRON I MUST REMARK THAT PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTS HAVING SHEWN ME IT CONTAINED NICKEL I TREATED SEVERAL KINDS OF THE MOST PURE IRONS I COULD OBTAIN WITH NITRIC ACID AND PRECIPITATED THE OXIDE FROM THE METALLIC SALT BY AMMONIA THE QUANTITY OF OXIDE I OBTAINED FOM IOO GRAINS OFIRON WAS FROM 144 TO 146 I MAY CONSEQUENTLY 1G9AG9 WMR HOWARDS EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS INFER THAT TOO GRAINS OF PURE IRON ACQUIRES BY SUCH A PROCESS 45 GRAINS OF OXYGEN AND THAT WHENEVER A METALLIC SUBSTANCE SUPPOSED TO BE IRON DOES NOT UNDER THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES ACQUIRE THE SAME PROPORTIONATE WEIGHT SOMETHING IS EITHER VOLATILIZED OR LEFT IN SOLUTION HENCE WHEN A METALLIC ALLOY OF NICKEL AND IRON PRESENTS ITSELF A JUDGMENT MAY AT LEAST BE FORMED OF THE QUANTITY OF NICKEL BY THE DEFICIENCY OF WEIGHT IN THE PRECIPITATED OXIDE OF IRON THIS MODE OF TREATMENT WAS NOT ALLOWED ME IN THE EXAMINA TION OF THE COATING OF THE STONE BECAUSE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW IN WHAT STATE OF OXIDIZEMENT THE IRON EXISTED BUT AS THE PARTICLES DISSEMINATED THROUGH THE WHOLE MASS ARE CLEARLY METALLIC A VERY TOLERABLE IDEA OF THE QUANTITIES OF NICKEL CON TAINED IN THEM WILL BE OBTAINED BY NOTING THE QUANTITY OF OXIDE OF IRON SEPARATED AS ABOVE DESCRIBED 25 GRAINS OF THESE METALLIC PARTICLES WERE THEREFORE HEATED WITH A QUANTITY OF NITRIC ACID MUCH MORE THAN SUFFICIENT TO DISSOLVE THE WHOLE SOME EARTHY MATTER WHICH AS IN A FORMER CASE WAS NOT SEPARABLE BY ME CHANICAL MEANS REMAINED AFTER A COMPLETE SOLUTION OF THE METAL HAD BEEN EFFECTED THIS EARTHY MATTER AFTER BEING IGNITEDWEIGHED TWO GRAINS THE REAL MATTER OF THE PRESENT EXAMINATION WAS THEREFORE REDUCED TO 23 GRAINS AND WAS IN COMPLETE SOLUTION I ADDED AMMONIA TO A VERY SENSIBLE EXCESS THE OXIDE OF IRON WAS THEREBY PRECIPITATED AND BEING COLLECTED AND IGNITED IT WEIGHED 24 GRAINS WHEREAS ACCORDING TO MY EXPERIMENTS 33 GRAINS SHOULD HAVE BEEN PRODUCED FROM THE SOLUTION HAD IT CONTAINED NOTHING BUT IRON I EXAMINED THE SALINE LIQUOR WHEN FREE FROM FERRUGINOUS PARTICLES AND DISCOVERED IT TO BE THE TRIPLE SALT OF NICKEL HENCE ALLOWING FOR LOSS THE QUANTITY OF NICKEL NMAY BE ESTIMATED BY CALCULATING THE QUANTITY OF IRON CONTAINEDON CERTAIN STONY AND METALLINE SUBSTANCES C IN 4 GRAINS OF OXIDE THUS IF 145 GRAINS OF OXIDE CONTAIN LOO OF IRON ABOUT 16Y ARE CONTAINED IN 24 OF OXIDE THIS WOULD SUPPOSE THE 23 GRAINS OF ALLOY TO CONSIST OF I6 IRON AND 6 NICKEL WHICH IF THE USUAL LOSS BE ADDED TO THE 16 GRAINS OF IRON AND DEDUCTED FROM THE NICKEL MAY NOT BE VERY REMOTE FROM THE TRUTH I SHALL NEXT EXAMINE THE GLOBULAR BODIES ALSO IRREGULARLY DIS PERSED THROUGHOUT THE STONE A NUMBER OF THEM WERE REDUCED TO FINE POWDER BUT NOTHING METALLIC COULD BE SEPARATED BY THE MAGNET AS A PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENT I SOUGHT FOR PYRITES BY DIGESTION WITH MURIATIC ACID BUT NO HEPATIC SMELL WAS IN THE LEAST PERCEIVABLE NOR WAS WHITE CARBONATE OF LEAD AT ALL ALTERED BY BEING HELD OVER THE MIXTURE I THEREFORE CONCLUDE THESE GLOBULAR BODIES DO NOT ENVELOPE EITHER IRON OR PYRITES BY WAY OF ANALYSIS I TREATED IOO GRAINS WITH POTASH IN A SILVER CRUCIBLE AND AFTER THE USUAL APPLICATION OF A RED HEAT SEPA RATED AS MUCH SILICA AS POSSIBLE BY MURIATIC ACID AND EVAPORATION THE SILICA BEING COLLECTED ON A FILTRE CARBONATE OF POTASH WAS ADDED TO THE FILTRATED LIQUOR BY WHICH A PRECIPITATE ALMOST WHOLLY FERRUGINOUS WAS PRODUCED THIS PRECIPITATE WAS COL LECTED IN THE COMMON WAY THEN BOILED WITH POTASH TO EXTRACT ALUMINA AND BY SUPERSATURATING THE ALKALINE LIQUOR WITH MURIATIC ACID AND PRECIPITATING BY CARBONATE OF AMMONIA AN EARTH WAS GATHERED WHICH I AFTERWARDS FOUND TO BE PARTLY IF NOT ENTIRELY SILICEOUS AFTER REDISSOLVING IN MURIATIC ACID THE PORTION OF THE FERRUGINOUS MATTER REJECTED BY THE POTASH I PRE CIPITATED BY AMMONIA WHAT I TOOK TO BE ENTIRELY OXIDE OF IRON BUT AFTER IGNITING IT AND AGAIN ATTEMPTING TO REDISSOLVE THE WHOLE IN MURIATIC ACID MORE SILICA WAS LEFT THE NONEXISTENCE OF LIME WAS PROVED BY THE ADDITION OF CARBONATE OF AMMONIA MDCCCII C C 193MR HOWARDS EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SAME ALKALI PURE HAD THROWN DOWN WHAT I TOOK WHOLLY FOR OXIDE OF IRON I HAD NOW OBTAINED EVERY THING IN THE SUBJECT OF MY ANALYSIS EXCEPT MAGNESIA AND NICKEL THE FORMER AND A TRACE OF THE LATTER WERE HELD BY CARBONIC ACID IN THE LIQUOR FROM WHICH THE FERRUGINOUS PRECIPITATE WAS IN THE FIRST INSTANCE THROWN DOWN BY CARBONATE OF POTASH AND THE LATTER WAS FOUND IN THE LAST NAMED MURIATE OF AMMONIA I DIS ENGAGED THE MAGNESIA BY THE ASSISTANCE OF POTASH AND BY EVAPORATING TO DRYNESS THE OXIDE OF NICKEL WAS PRECIPITATED BY HYDROGENIZED SULPHURET OF AMMONIA UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES I AM INDUCED TO STATE THE PROPORTIONS OF CONSTITUENT PARTS THUS SILICA 50 MAGNESIA 15 OXIDE OF IRON  OXIDE OF NICKEL  2 THE EXCESS OF WEIGHT INSTEAD OF THE USUAL LOSS IS OWING TO THE DIFFERENCE OF OXIDIZEMENT OF THE IRON IN THE STONE AND IN THE RESULT OF THE ANALYSIS WHICH WILL BE FOUND TO BE THE CASE IN ALL ANALYSES OF THESE SUBSTANCES  INDEED IT IS ALWAYS NECESSARY TO REDUCE THE OXIDE TO THE RED STATE AS BEING THE ONLY ONE TO BE DEPENDED UPON TO AVOID FUTURE REPETITION I SHALL ALSO OBSERVE FIRST THAT BY PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTS I COULD NOT DETECT ANY OTHER SUBSTANCE THAN THOSE MENTIONED SECONDLY THAT THE EARTH OBTAINED AS ALUMINA APPEARED TO ME TO BE MOSTLY IF NOT ENTIRELY SILICEOUS BECAUSE AFTER IT HAD BEEN IGNITED AND AGAIN TREATED WITH POTASH AND MURIATIC ACID I FOUND IT WAS VERY NEARLY ALL PRECIPITATED BY EVAPORATION THIRDLY I EXAMINED AND JUDGED OF THE SILICA COLLECTED FROM THE OXIDE OF IROA IN THE 194ON CERTAIN STONY AND METALLINE SUBSTANCES C 1 SAME WAY FOURTHLY THE WEIGHT OF THE MAGNESIA IS GIVEN NOT IMMEDIATELY AS OBTAINED BY EVAPORATION BUT AFTER A SUBSEQUENT SOLUTION IN AN ACID AND PRECIPITATION BY POTASH AND FIFTHLY THE PROPORTIONS ARE TAKEN FROM THE MEAN OF TWO ANALYSES NOTHING REMAINS TO BE EXAMINED OF THE STONE FROM BENARES EXCEPT THE EARTHY MATTER FORMING A CEMENT OR MATRIX FOR THE SUBSTANCES ALREADY EXAMINED TOO GRAINS OF THIS MATTER WERE BY MECHANICAL MEANS SEPARATED AS PERFECTLY AS POSSIBLE FROM THE PYRITES IRON AND GLOBULAR BODIES AND ANALYSED AS ABOVE THE MEAN RESULT OF TWO ANALYSES GAVE SILICA  48 MAGNESIA  18 OXIDE OF IRON 4 OXIDE OF NICKEL  1O2E 102 EXAMINATION OF THE STONE FROM SIENNA THE EXTERNAL COATING OF THIS STONE APPEARED TO HAVE THE SAME CHARACTERS AS THAT OF THE STONE FROM BENARES THE PYRITES ALTHOUGH CERTAINLY PRESENT WERE NOT CRYSTALLIZED IN SUCH GROUPS AS IN THE PRECEDING STONE NOR COULD THEY BE SEPARATED BY MECHANICAL MEANS THE ATTRACTABLE METAL WAS EASILY SEPARATED BY THE MAGNET BUT 8 GRAINS ONLY WERE COLLECTED I TREATED THEM WITH NITRIC ACID AND AMMONIA AS IN A PRECEDING CASE NEARLY ONE GRAIN OF EARTHY MATTER WAS INSOLUBLE THE WEIGHT WAS THEREFORE REDUCED TO RATHER LESS THAN 8 GRAINS THE OXIDE OF IRON PRECIPITATED BY AMMONIA WEIGHED 8 GRAINS AND THE SALINE LIQUOR GAVE ABUN DANT INDICATIONS OF NICKEL AS 8 GRAINS OF THIS OXIDE OF IRON CONTAIN NEARLY 6 OF METAL THE QUANTITY OF NICKEL IN THE BARE 8 CC 2MR HOWARDS ETPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS GRAINS MAY BE ESTIMATED BETWEEN 1 AND 2 GRAINS SOME GLO BULAR BODIES WERE EXTRACTED BUT TOO FEW TO ANALYZE SINCE THE PYRITES COULD NOT BE SEPARATED I COLLECTED 15O GRAINS OF THE STONE FREED FROM IRON BY THE MAGNET AND AS EXEMPT AS POSSIBLE FROM GLOBULAR BODIES THESE 15O GRAINS I FIRST DIGESTED WITH MURIATIC ACID THAT THE PYRITES MIGHT BE DECOMPOSED AND EVERY TLING TAKEN UP WHICH COULD BE DISSOLVED BY THAT MENSTRUUM A VERY DECIDED DISENGAGEMENT OF SUL PHURETED HYDROGEN GAS WAS OCCASIONED WHEN THE ACID COULD PRODUCE NO FURTHER ACTION I COLLECTED THE UNDISSOLVED MATTER ON A FILTRE AND BOILED IT WITH THE MOST CONCENTRATE NITRIC ACID IN HOPES OF BEING ABLE TO CONVERT THE SULPHUR PREVIOUSLY LIBERATED INTO SULPHURIC ACID BUT MY ENDEAVOURS WERE FRUITLESS FOR UPON THE ADDITION OF NITRATE OF BARYTES TO THE NITRIC SOLUTION RENDERED PREVIOUSLY TRANSPARENT A VERY INSIGNIFICANT QUANTITY OF SULPHATE OF BARYTES WAS OBTAINED THE SURPLUS OF BARYTIC NITRATE WAS REMOVED BY SULPHATE OF POTASH I NEXT COMPLETELY EDULCORATED THE MASS WHICH REMAINED INSOLUBLE AFTER THE ACTION OF THE MURIATIC AND NITRIC ACIDS AND ADDING THE WATER OF EDUL CORATION TO THE MURIATIC AND NITRIC LIQUORS EVAPORATED THE WHOLE FOR SILICA I THEN SUBMITTED THE MASS UNDISSOLVED BY THE ACIDS AND THE WATER TO THE TREATMENT WITH POTASH MURIATIC ACID AND EVAPORATION WHICH WAS IN THE FIRST INSTANCE APPLIED TO THE STONE FROM BENARES THE FIRST PRECIPITATION WAS AS IN THAT ANA LYSIS ALSO EFFECTED WITH CARBONATE OF POTASH BUT INSTEAD OF ENDEAVOURING IMMEDIATELY TO EXTRACT ALUMINA I IGNITED THE PRECIPITATE THAT THE ALUMINA OR SILICA REMAINING MIGHT BE REN DERED INSOLUBLE AFTER THE IGNITION I SEPARATED THE OXIDE OF IRON WITH VERY CONCENTRATE MURIATIC ACID AND THE EARTHS WHICH WERE LEFT PERFECTLY WHITE I HEATED WITH POTASH UNTIL THEY WERE 196ON CERTAIN STONY AND METALLIE SUBSTANCES C AGAIN CAPABLE OF BEING TAKEN UP BY THE SAME ACID THE SOLUTION SO MADE WAS SLOWLY EVAPORATED AND AS VERY NEARLY EVERY THING WAS DEPOSITED DURING THE EVAPORATION I CONCLUDE ALL WAS SILICA THE PROPORTIONS RESULTING FROM THIS SINGLE ANALYSIS WITHOUT THE WEIGHT OF SULPHUR CONTAINED IN THE PYRITES IRREGU LARLY DISSEMINATED THROUGH THE WHOLE WERE SILICA 70 MAGNESIA 3 OXIDE OF IRON  5 OXIDE OF NICKEL  59 EXAMINATION OF THE STONE FROM YORKSHIRE THE MECHANICAL SEPARATION OF THE SUBSTANCES IN THIS STONE BEING AS DIFFICULT AS IN THE PRECEDING CASE I WAS NECESSARILY SATISFIED WITH SUBMITTING IT TO THE SAME TREATMENTO I COLLECTED HOWEVER 34 GRAINS OF MALLEABLE PARTICLES WHICH BY THE PROCESS ALREADY MORE THAN ONCE MENTIONED LEFT 4 GRAINS OF EARTHY MATTER AND BY YIELDING 371 OF OXIDE OF IRON INDICATED ABOUT 4 GRAINS OF NICKEL

ME TO TRESPASS MORE ON THE LIBERALITY OF MR GREVILLE THAN TO DETACH A SMALL PORTION I FOUND IT OF SIMILAR COMPOSITION TO THAT OF THE THREE PRECEDING STONES AND THE COUNT DE BOURNON HAS ALREADY SHEWN THE PROPORTIONATE QUANTITY OF THE ATTRACTABLE METAL TO BE VERY CONSIDERABLE 166 GRAINS LEFT 2 OF EXTRANEOUS EARTHY MATTER AND YIELDED BY THE TREATMENT WITH NITRIC ACID AND AMMONIA 17 GRAINS OF OXIDE

 5 MAGNESIA  9 OXIDE OF IRON  23 OXIDE OF NICKEL  1 592 THE UNUSUAL INCREASE OF WEIGHT IN THE RESULT OF THE THREE LAST ANALYSES NOTWITHSTANDING THE ENTIRE LOSS OF THE SULPHUR IN THE PYRITES IS OBVIOUSLY OWING TO THE METALLIC STATE OF THE IRON COMBINED WITH THE SULPHUR AS WAS SHEWN IN A FORMER INSTANCE I HAVE NOW CONCLUDED THE CHEMICAL EXAMINATION OF THESE FOUR EXTRAORDINARY SUBSTANCES IT UNFORTUNATELY DIFFERS FROM THE ANA LYSIS MADE BY THE FRENCH ACADEMICIANS OF THE STONE PRESENTED TO THEM BY THE ABBE BACHELAY AS WELL AS FROM THAT MADE BY PROFESSOR BARTHOLD OF THE STONE OF ENSISHEIM IT IS AT VARIANCE WITH THAT OF THE ACADEMICIANS INASMUCH AS THEY FOUND NEITHER MAGNESIA NOR NICKEL IT DIFFERS FROM THAT OF MR BARTHOLD AS HE DID NOT FIND NICKEL BUT DISCOVERED SOME LIME WITH 17 PER CENT OF ALUMINA WITH REGARD TO THESE DIFFERENCES I HAVE TO SUBMIT TO THE CHEMLICAL WORLD WHETHER MAGNESIA MIGLT INOT 198ON CERTAIN STONY AND METALLINE SUBSTANCES  199 HAVE ELUDED THE ACTION OF AN ACID WHEN THE AGGREGATION OF THE INTEGRANT PARTS OF THE STONE WAS NOT DESTROYED BY TREAT MENT WITH POTASH AS TO THE EXISTENCE OF ALUMINA I DO NOT ABSOLUTELY DENY IT YET I MUST OBSERVE THAT THE WHOLE OF THE EARTH WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE ANY RESEMBLANCE HOWEVER SMALL TO ALUMINA WAS AT MOST 3 PER CENT AND THERE SEEMS GOOD REASON TO CONSIDER IT AS SILICA RESPECTING THE EXISTENCE OF LIME IN THE STONE OF ENSISHEIM I MUST APPEAL TO PROFESSOR BAR THOLD WHETHER SUPPOSING LIME A CONSTITUENT PART SULPHATE OF LIME SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN FORMED AS WELL AS SULPHATE OF MAGNESIA WHEN SULPHURIC ACID WAS GENERATED BY IGNITING THE EARTHS AND PYRITES AND AS TO THE PROPORTION OF ALUMINA IN THE SAME STONE I WOULD ASK AT LEAST WHETHER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO CONSIDERABLE IF THE SOLUTIONS FORMED BY ACIDS AFTER THE TREATMENT WITH POTASH HAD BEEN EVAPORATED TO THE REQUISITE DRYNESS NOT TO OBSERVE THAT NO MENTION IS MADE OF ANY EXAMI NATION OF THE PROPERTIES OF THE EARTH CALLED ALUMINA IN THE PROPORTION OF MAGNESIA I HAVE THE SATISFACTION TO FIND MY ANA LYSIS CORRESPOND VERY NEARLY WITH THAT OF PROFESSOR BARTHOLD AND IF WHAT HE CONSIDERED ALUMINA WERE SUPPOSED SILICA THE STONE RESENTED TO THE FRENCH ACADEMY THE STONE OF ENSISHEIM AND THE FOUR I HAVE EXAMINED WOULD AGREE VERY NEARLY IN SILI CEOUS PROPORTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE NICKEL I AM CONFIDENT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FOUND IN ALL HAD THE METALLIC PARTICLES BEEN SEPARATELY EXAMINED BUT WHATEVER BE THESE VARIATIONS THE MINERALOGICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE FRENCH ACADEMICIANS OF MR BARTHOLD AND OF THE COUNT DE BOURNON ALL EXHIBIT A STRIKING CONFORMITY OF CHARACTER COMMON TO EACH OF THESE STONES AND I DOUBT NOT BUT THE SIMILARITY OF COMPONENT PARTS ESPECIALLY OF THE MALLEABLE ALLOY TOGETHER WITL THE NEAR APPROACH OF THEALR HOWARD S EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERV ATON CONSTITUENT PROPORTIONS OF THE EARTHS CONTAINED IN EACH OF THE FOUR STONES THE IMMEDIATE SUBJECT OF THIS PAPER WILL ESTABLISH VERY STRONG EVIDENCE IN FAVOUR OF THE ASSERTION THAT THEY HAVE FALLEN ON OUR GLOBE THEY HAVE BEEN FOUND AT PLACES VERY REMOTE FROM EACH OTHER AND AT PERIODS ALSO SUFFICIENTLY DISTANT THE MINERALOGISTS WHO HAVE EXAMINED THEM AGREE THAT THEY HAVE NO RESEMBLANCE TO MINERAL SUBSTANCES PROPERLY SO CALLED NOR HAVE THEY BEEN DESCRIBED BY MINERALOGICAL AUTHORS I WOULD FURTHER URGE THE AUTHENTICITY OF ACCOUNTS OF FALLEN STONES AND THE SIMILARITY OF CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDANT ON SUCH PHENOMENA BUT TO THE IMPARTIAL IT WOULD BE SUPERFLUOUS AND TO THOSE WHO DIS BELIEVE WHATEVER THEY CANNOT EXPLAIN IT WOULD BE FRUITLESS AT TEMPTS TO RECONCILE OCCURRENCES OF THIS NATURE WITH KNOWN PRIN CIPLES OF PHILOSOPHY IT IS TRUE ARE ALREADY ABUNDANT BUT AS THE EARL OF BRISTOL HAS WELL EXPRESSED THEY LEAVE US A CHOICE OF DIF FICULTIES EQUALLY PERPLEXING IT IS HOWEVER REMARKABLE THAT DR CHLADNI WHO SEEMS TO HAVE INDULGED IN THESE SPECULA TIONS WITH MOST SUCCESS SHOULD HAVE CONNECTED THE DESCENT OF FALLEN STONES WITH METEORS AND THAT IN THE NARRATIVE OF MR WILLIAMS THE DESCENT OF THE STONES NEAR BENARES SHOULD HAVE BEEN IMMEDIATELY ACCOMPANIED WITH A METEOR NO LUMINOUS APPEARANCE HAVING BEEN PERCEIVED DURING THE DAY ON WHICH THE STONE FELL IN YORKSHIRE IT MUST BE ADMITTED RATHER MILITATES AGAINST THE IDEA THAT THESE STONES ARE THE SUB STANCES WHICH PRODUCE OR CONVEY THE LIGHT OF A METEOR OR THAT A METEOR MUST NECESSARILY ACCOMPANY THEM YET THE STONES FROM SIENNA FELL AMIDST WHAT WAS IMAGINED LIGHTNING BUT WHAT MIGHT IN REALITY HAVE BEEN A METEOR STONES WERE ALSO FOUND  IN THE ACCOUNT OF THE STONE WHICH FELL IN PORTUGAL NO MENTION IS MADE EITHER OF T METEOR OR LIGHTNING LLIJ0ON CERTAIN STONY AND METALLINE SUBSTANCES C AFTER THE METEOR SEEN IN GASCONY IN JULY 1790 AND MR FALCONET IN THE MEMOIR I HAVE ALREADY QUOTED RELATES THAT THE STONE WHICH WAS ADORED AS THE MOTHER OF THE GODS WAS A BOETILIA AND THAT IT FELL AT THE FEET OF THE POET PINDAR ENVELOPED IN A BALL OF FIRE HE ALSO OBSERVES THAT ALL THE BOETILIA HAD THE SAME ORIGIN I OUGHT NOT PERHAPS TO SUPPRESS THAT IN ENDEAVOURING TO FORM AN ARTIFICIAL BLACK COATING ON THE INTERIOR SURFACE OF ONE OF THE STONES FROM BENARES BY SENDING OVER IT THE ELECTRICAL CHARGE OF ABOUT 37 SQUARE FEET OF GLASS IT WAS OBSERVED TO BECOME LUMI NOUS IN THE DARK FOR NEARLY A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND THAT THE TRACT OF THE ELECTRICAL FLUID WAS RENDERED BLACK I BY NO MEANS WISH TO LAY ANY STRESS UPON THIS CIRCUMSTANCE FOR I AM WELL AWARE THAT MANY SUBSTANCES BECOME LUMINOUS BY ELECTRICITY BUT SHOULD IT EVER BE DISCOVERED THAT FALLEN STONES ARE ACTUALLY THE BODIES OF METEORS IT WOULD NOT APPEAR SO PROBLEMATICAL THAT SUCH MASSES AS THESE STONES ARE SOMETIMES REPRESENTED DO NOT PENETRATE FURTHER INTO THE EARTH FOR METEORS MOVE MORE IN A HORIZONTAL THAN IN A PERPENDICULAR DIRECTION AND WE ARE AS ABSOLUTELY UNACQUAINTED WITH THE FORCE WHICH IMPELS THE METEOR AS WITH THE ORIGIN OF THE FALLEN STONE BEFORE I CLOSE THIS SUBJECT I MAY BE PARTICULARLY EXPECTED TO NOTICE THE METEOR WHICH A FEW MONTHS AGO TRAVERSED THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK IT WAS SAID THAT PART OF IT FELL NEAR SAINT EDMUNDSBURY AND EVEN THAT IT SET FIRE TO A COTTAGE IN THAT VICINITY IT APPEARED FROM INQUIRIES MADE ON THE SPOT THAT SOMETHING SEEMINGLY FROM THE METEOR WAS WITH A DEGREE OF REASON BELIEVED TO HAVE FALLEN IN THE ADJACENT MEADOWS BUT THE TIME OF THE COMBUSTION OF THE HOUSE DID NOT CORRESPOND WITH THE MOMENT OF THE METEORS TRANSITION A PHENOMENON MUCH MDCCCIX D D ISOMR HOWARDS EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS MORE WORTHY OF ATTENTION HAS SINCE BEEN DESCRIBED IN THE PHILO SOPHICAL MAGAZINE ON THE NIGHT OF THE 5TH OF APRIL 1800 A BODY WHOLLY LUMINOUS WAS SEEN IN AMERICA TO MOVE WITH PRODIGIOUS VELOCITY ITS APPARENT SIZE WAS THAT OF A LARGE HOUSE 70 FEET LONG AND ITS ELEVATION ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH ABOUT 200 YARDS THE LIGHT PRODUCED EFFECTS LITTLE SHORT OF SUN BEAMS AND A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF HEAT WAS FELT BY THOSE WHO SAW IT BUT NO ELECTRIC SENSATION IMMEDIATELY AFTER IT DIS APPEARED IN THE NORTHWEST A VIOLENT RUSHING NOISE WAS HEARD AS IF THE PHENOMENON WERE BEARING DOWN THE FOREST BEFORE IT AND IN A FEW SECONDS AFTER THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS CRASH CAUSING A VERY SENSIBLE EARTHQUAKE SEARCH BEING AFTERWARDS MADE IN THE PLACE WHERE THE BURNING BODY FELL EVERY VEGETABLE WAS FOUND BURNT OR GREATLY SCORCHED AND A CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH BROKEN UP WE HAVE TO LAMENT THAT THE AUTHORS OF THIS ACCOUNT DID NOT SEARCH DEEPER THAN THE SUR FACE OF THE GROUND SUCH AN IMMENSE BODY THOUGH MOVING IN A HORIZONTAL DIRECTION COULD NOT BUT BE BURIED TO A CONSIDERABLE DEPTH SHOULD IT HAVE BEEN MORE THAN THE SEMBLANCE OF A BODY OF A PECULIAR NATURE THE LAPSE OF AGES MAY PERHAPS EFFECT WHAT HAS NOW BEEN NEGLECTED AND ITS MAGNITUDE AND SOLITARY SITUATION BECOME THE ASTONISHMENT OF FUTURE PHILOSOPHERS THIS LEADS ME TO SPEAK OF THE SOLITARY MASS OF WHAT HAS BEEN CALLED NATIVE IRON WHICH WAS DISCOVERED IN SOUTH AMERICA AND HAS BEEN DESCRIBED BY DON RUBIN DE CELIS ITS WEIGHT WAS ABOUT 15 TONS THE SAME AUTHOR MENTIONS ANOTHER INSULATED MASS OF THE SAME NATURE THE WHOLE ACCOUNT IS EXCEEDINGLY INTERESTING BUT BEING ALREADY PUBLISHED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS FOR THE YEAR 1788 IT NEEDS NOT BE HERE REPEATED MR PROUST HAS SHEWN THE MASS PARTICULARLY DESCRIBED NOT TO 02ON CERTAIN STONY AND METALLINE SUBSTANCES C BE WHOLLY IRON BUT A MIXTURE OF NICKEL AND IRON THE TRUSTEES OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM WHO ARE IN POSSESSION OF SOME FRAGMENTS OF THIS MASS SENT TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY BY DON RUBIN DE CELIS HAVE DONE ME THE HONOUR TO PERMIT ME TO EXAMINE THEM AND I HAVE GREAT SATISFACTION IN AGREEING WITH A CHEMIST SO JUSTLY CELEBRATED AS MR PROUST THE CONNEXION WHICH NATURALLY EXISTS BETWEEN ONE MASS OF NATIVE IRON AND ANOTHER IMMEDIATELY TURNS OUR ATTENTION TO THE NATIVE IRON IN SIBERIA DESCRIBED BY PALLAS AND THIS WE ARE TOLD THE TARTARS CONSIDERED AS A SACRED RELIC WHICH HAD DROPPED FROM HEAVEN THE NICKEL FOUND IN THE ONE MASS AND THE TRADITIONAL HISTORY OF THE OTHER NOT TO COMPARE THE GLOBULAR BODIES OF THE STONE FROM BENARES WITH THE GLOBULAR CONCAVITIES AND THE EARTHY MATTER OF THE SIBERIAN IRON TEND TO THE FORMATION OF A CHAIN BETWEEN FALLEN STONES AND ALL KINDS OF NATIVE IRON HOW FAR ANY REAL AFFINITY EXISTS BETWEEN THESE SEVERAL SUBSTANCES VERY OBLIGING FRIENDS HAVE AFFORDED ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO FORM SOME JUDGMENT I AM INDEBTED TO MR GREVILLE AND MR HATCHETT FOR PORTIONS OF ALMOST EVERY KNOWN NATIVE IRON AND THE COUNT DE BOURNON HAS DONE ME THE FAVOUR PARTICULARLY TO DESCRIBE THEM AS FOLLOWS DESCRIPTION OF VARIOUS KINDS OF NATIVE IRON BY THE COUNT DE BOURNON THE GREAT NUMBER OF PARTICLES OF IRON IN A PERFECTLY METALLIC STATE CONTAINED IN THE STONE FROM BOHEMIA AND THE SAID PAR TICLES BEING SO NEAR EACH OTHER NATURALLY LEAD TO SOME RE FLECTIONS RESPECTING THE EXISTENCE OF NATIVE IRON WHICH BY MANY MINERALOGISTS IS STILL CONSIDERED AS PROBLEMATICAL LET US SUPPOSE FOR A MOMENT THAT THESE PARTICLES OF IRON WERE TO DD 2 0S0MRI IHOWARDS EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS APPROACH STILL MORE NEARLY TO EACH OTHER SO AS ABSOLUTELY TO COME INTO CONTACT AND IN THAT MANNER TO FORM A KIND OF CHAIN FOLDED UPON ITSELF IN THE INTERIOR PART OF THE SUBSTANCE AND LEAVING A GREAT NUMBER OF CAVITIES BETWEEN THE LINKS OF THE CHAIN SO FOLDED LET US THEN SUPPOSE THAT THE EARTHY SUBSTANCE WITH WHICH THESE CAVITIES ARE FILLED BEING VERY POROUS AND HAVING BUT A SMALL DEGREE OF CONSISTENCE SHOULD AS MAY HAPPEN BY A VARIETY OF CAUSES BE DESTROYED IT IS PLAIN THAT IF SUCH A DESTRUCTION WERE TO TAKE PLACE THE IRON ALONE WOULD REMAIN AND BEING THUS LEFT BARE IT WOULD APPEAR IN THE FORM OF A MASS MORE OR LESS CONSIDERABLE OF A CELLULAR TEXTURE AND AS IT WERE RAMIFIED SUCH A FORM IN SHORT AS THAT IN WHICH MOST OF THE NATIVE IRONS WE ARE ACQUAINTED WITH HAVE BEEN FOUND MAY IT NOT BE FAIR TO ATTRIBUTE TO SUCH AN ORIGIN THE NATIVE IRON FOUND IN BOHEMIA A SPECIMEN OF WHICH WAS PRESENTED BY THE ACADEMY OF FREYBERG TO BARON BORN AND WHICH CAME WITH THE REST OF HIS COLLECTION INTO THE HANDS OF MR GREVILLE  MAY NOT SUCH ALSO NOTWITHSTANDING THE ENORMITY OF ITS BULK BE THE ORIGIN OF THLE MASS OF NATIVE IRON FOUND IN SIBERIA NEAR MOUNT KEMIRS BY THE CELEBRATED PALLAS WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN IN THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSES MADE BY MR HOWARD OF THE VARIOUS STONES ABOVE DESCRIBED THAT HE CONSTANTLY FOUND A CERTAIN PROPORTION OF NICKEL MIXED WITH THE IRON THEY CONTAINED THIS CIRCUMSTANCE RECALLS TO OUR NOTICE THE OBSERVATIONS THAT WERE MADE BY MR PROUST SOME TIME AGO RESPECTING THE MIXTURE OF NICKEL IN THE NATIVE IRON OF SOUTH AMERICA AND TENDS TO GIVE SOME ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TO THE OPI NION HINTED AT IN THE FOREGOING PARAGRAPH THE CIRCUMSTANCES JUST MENTIONED NATURALLY GAVE TO MR HOWARD AS WELL AS TO ME A DESIRE TO KNOW WHETHER THE 2O04ON CERTAIN STONY AND METALLINE SUBSTANCES C NATIVE IRON FROM SIBERIA AND THAT FROM BOHEMIA WERE ALSO MIXED WITH NICKEL MR HOWARD CONSEQUENTLY LOST NO TIME IN PROCEEDING UPON THIS IMPORTANT INVESTIGATION THE NATIVE IRON OF SIBERIA PRESENTS SOME VERY INTERESTING PECULIARITIES AND HAS OFTEN BEEN REFERRED TO BUT HAS NOT YET BEEN PROPERLY DESCRIBED IT IS THEREFORE WITH GREAT PLEASURE THAT I ADD THE FOLLOWING DESCRIPTION OF IT AND OF SOME OTHER KINDS OF NATIVE IRON TO THE DESCRIPTION I HAVE ALREADY GIVEN OF THE VARIOUS STONES SAID TO HAVE FALLEN ON THE EARTH I FEEL THE GREATER SATISFACTION IN DOING THIS AS THE NOBLE COL LECTION OF MR GREVILLE CONTAINS TWO SPECIMENS OF THIS IRON IN PERFECT CONDITION ONE OF WHICH WEIGHS SEVERAL POUNDS AND WAS SENT TO MR GREVILLE BY MR PALLAS HIMSELF ON THIS ACCOUNT THEREFORE I ENJOY AN ADVANTAGE THAT MANY OF THE AUTHORS WHO HAVE SPOKEN OF THIS IRON PROBABLY WANTED ONE OF THESE PIECES HAS A CELLULAR AND RAMIFIED TEXTURE ANA LOGOUS TO THAT OF SOME VERY POROUS AND LIGHT VOLCANIC SCORIA THIS IS THE USUAL TEXTURE OF THE SPECIMENS OF THIS KIND OF IRON WHICH ARE PRESERVED IN THE VARIOUS MINERALOGICAL COLLECTIONS IN EUROPE WHEN IT IS ATTENTIVELY EXAMINED THERE MAY BE PER CEIVED IN IT NOT ONLY EMPTY CELLS BUT ALSO IMPRESSIONS OR CAVITIES OF GREATER OR LESS DEPTH AND SOMETIMES PERFECTLY ROUND WHICH APPEAR EVIDENTLY TO BE THE RESULT OF THE COMPRESSION OF HARD BODIES WHICH WERE SITUATED THERE AND WHICH WHEN THEY CAME AWAY LEFT THE SURFACE OF THESE CAVITIES QUITE SMOOTH AND HAVING THE LUSTRE OF POLISHED METAL HERE AND THERE IN SOME OF THESE CAVITIES THERE REMAINS A TRANSPARENT SUBSTANCE OF A YELLOWISH GREEN COLOUR OF WHICH I SHALL TREAT MORE PARTICULARLY WHEN I COME TO THE DESCRIPTION OF THE SECOND OF THE SPECIMENS ABOVE MENTIONED IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT THE CAVITIES HERE SPOKEN OF 8O0MR HOWARDS EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS OWE THEIR EXISTENCE TO THIS TRANSPARENT SUBSTANCE AND THAT THE POLISH OF THE CAVITIES ARISES MERELY FROM THE COMPRESSION OF THE SAID SUBSTANCE AND IS THE NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF ITS SURFACE HAVING BEEN IN PERFECT CONTACT WITH THAT OF THE IRON THIS IRON IS VERY MALLEABLE IT MAY BE EASILY CUT WITH A KNIFE AND MAY BE AS EASILY FLATTENED OR EXTENDED BY MEANS OF A HAMMER ITS SPECIFIC GRAVITY IS 6487 WHICH HOWEVER IS VERY MUCH UNDER THAT OF IRON WHICH HAS BEEN MERELY MELTED AND HAS NOT BEEN FORGED THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF THE NATIVE IRON OF BOHEMIA WHICH IS NEARLY AS MALLEABLE AND AS EASY TO BE CUT IS STILL LESS I FOUND IT NOT TO EXCEED 6146 THIS LOW DEGREE OF GRAVITY APPEARS TO BE OWING PARTLY TO THE OXIDIZEMENT OF THE SURFACE OF THE IRON AND PARTLY TO THERE BEING IN THE INTERIOR PART OF ITS SUBSTANCE A NUMBER OF SMALL CAVITIES WHICH ARE OFTEN RENDERED VISIBLE BY FRACTURE AND WHICH HAVE THEIR SURFACES ALSO OXIDIZED THE FRACTURE OF THIS IRON PRESENTS THE SAME SHINING AND SILVERY WHITE COLOUR AS THE COMMON CAST IRON KNOWN BY THE NAME OF WHITE CAST IRON BUT ITS GRAIN IS MUCH SMOOTHER AND FINER IT IS ALSO MUCH MORE MALLEABLE WHEN COLD BERGMAN SAYS THAT THIS IRON IS BRITTLE WHEN HEATED TO A RED HEAT I HAVE FREQUENTLY TRIED IT IN THAT STATE AND HAVE CONSTANTLY FOUND IT TO BE MALLEABLE THE SAME REMARK MAY BE APPLIED TO THE NATIVE IRON FROM SOUTH AMERICA AND ALSO TO THAT FROM SENEGAL THE SECOND OF THE TWO SPECIMENS MENTIONED ABOVE AND WHICH WEIGHS SEVERAL POUNDS PRESENTS AN ASPECT THAT DIFFERS IN SOME RESPECTS FROM THAT OF THE PRECEDING SPECIMEN THE MOST CONSIDERABLE PART OF IT FORMS A SOLID COMPACT MASS IN WHICH THERE IS NOT TO BE PERCEIVED THE SMALLEST APPEARANCE OF PORES OR CAVITIES BUT THERE ARISES UPON ITS SURFACE A KIND OF RAMIFIED O6ON CERTAIN STONY AND METALLINE SUBSTANCES C 0O7 OR CELLULAR PART SIMILAR IN EVERY RESPECT TO THE SPECIMEN ALREADY DESCRIBED AND EVERY WHERE COMPLETELY CONNECTED WITH THE SUBSTANCE OF THE MASS ITSELF IF THE COMPACT PART OF THIS PIECE IS EXAMINED WITH ATTENTION IT WILL BE PERCEIVED THAT IT IS NOT ENTIRELY COMPOSED OF IRON IN THE METALLIC STATE BUT THAT IT IS MIXED WITH NEARLY AN EQUAL QUANTITY OF THE TRANSPARENT SUBSTANCE OF A YELLOWISH GREEN COLOUR SOMETIMES ALSO OF A GREENISH YELLOW ALREADY SPOKEN OF IN THE DESCRIPTION OF THE OTHER SPECIMEN THIS SUBSTANCE IS MIXED WITH THE IRON IN SUCH A MANNER THAT IF THE WHOLE OF THE FORMER COULD BE REMOVED THE REMAINING PART WOULD CONSIST MERELY OF IRON IN THE METALLIC STATE AND WOULD PRESENT THE SAME CELLULAR APPEARANCE AS THE PRECEDING SPECIMEN AND THE RAMIFIED OR CELLULAR PART OF THE SPECIMEN NOW DESCRIBED THIS STONY PART SEPARATED FROM THE IRON APPEARS IN THE FORM OF SMALL NODULES GENERALLY OF AN IRREGULAR SHAPE BUT SOMETIMES NEARLY GLOBULAR THEY HAVE A PERFECTLY SMOOTH AND SHINING SURFACE SO AS VERY OFTEN TO PRESENT THE APPEARANCE OF SMALL BALLS OF GLASS A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT HAS LED MANY PERSONS TO SUPPOSE THEM THE RESULT OF A REAL VITRIFICATION SOME OF THESE NODULES HAVE SEVERAL IRREGULAR FACETS PRODUCED BY THE COM PRESSION OF THE IRON IN WHICH THEY WERE INCLOSED BUT I HAVE NEVER OBSERVED IN THEM ANY APPEARANCES THAT COULD LEAD ME TO SUSPECT THEY HAD THE SLIGHTEST TENDENCY WHATEVER TO ASSUME A DETERMINED CRYSTALLINE FORM THIS SUBSTANCE IS ALWAYS MORE OR LESS TRANSPARENT IT IS SUFFI CIENTLY HARD TO CUT GLASS BUT HAS NO EFFECT UPON QUARTZ IT IS VERY BRITTLE ITS FRACTURE IS USUALLY CONCHOID BUT I COULD NOT PERCEIVE THAT IT BROKE IN ANY PARTICULAR DIRECTION IN SUCH A WAY THAT I COULD CONSIDER THE FRACTURE AS A NATURAL ONE IT BECOMESMR HOWARDS EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS ELECTRIC BY FRICTION ITS SPECIFIC GRAVITY IS FROM 3263 TO 3300 IT IS VERY REFRACTORY I KEPT IT FOR SOME TIME EXPOSED TO A DEGREE OF HEAT SUFFICIENTLY STRONG TO OXIDIZE TO A CONSIDERABLE DEPTH THE IRON CRUCIBLE IN WHICH IT WAS PLACED WITHOUT ITS HAVING UNDER GONE ANY ALTERATION EXCEPT THAT OF HAVING ACQUIRED A GREATER DEGREE OF INTENSITY IN ITS COLOUR ITS TRANSPARENCY WAS NOT AT ALL DIMINISHED I THINK THEREFORE THERE IS NOT THE SMALLEST REASON TO ALLOW ANY PROBABILITY TO THE OPINION THAT IT OUGHT TO BE CON SIDERED AS A KIND OF GLASS OF ALL SUBSTANCES HITHERTO KNOWN THAT WITH WHICH IT SEEMS TO HAVE THE GREATEST ANALOGY IS THE PERIDOT THE CHRYSOLITE OF WER NER TO WHICH SOME MINERALOGISTS HAVE REFERRED IT THE RESULT OF MR HOWARDS ANALYSIS OF IT IS NEARLY THE SAME AS THAT OF THE ANALYSIS OF THE PERIDOT MADE BY MR KLAPROTH THE HARDNESS AND INFUSIBILITY OF THIS SUBSTANCE ARE NEARLY THE SAME AS THOSE OF THE PERIDOT BUT IT SEEMS TO HAVE A RATHER LESS DEGREE OF SPECIFIC GRAVITY THAT OF TWO VERY PERFECT CRYSTALS OF PERIDOT I FOUND TO BE FROM 3340 TO 3375 THE CRYSTALLINE FORMS OF THE SUBSTANCE HERE DESCRIBED IF EVER WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DETERMINE THEM WOULD CLEAR UP OUR DOUBTS RESPECTING THE ANALOGY BETWEEN THE TWO SUBSTANCES IF WE CONSIDER THE COMPACT PART OF THE SPECIMEN NOW TREATED OF PARTICULARLY THE STRONG CON NEXION THAT APPEARS TO EXIST BETWEEN THE IRON AND THE TRANSPARENT SUBSTANCE AND THE GREAT RESISTANCE WE EXPERIENCE WHEN WE ATTEMPT TO SEPARATE THEM WE CANNOT HELP BEING SURPRISED THAT ALMOST ALL THE SPECIMENS OF THIS MASS OF METALLIC IRON THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO EUROPE ARE IN THE CELLULAR STATE ALREADY DESCRIBED OWING APPARENTLY TO THE TOTAL OR ALMOST TOTAL DE STRUCTION OF THE TRANSPARENT SUBSTANCE BUT BESIDES THE FRA GILITY OF THIS SUBSTANCE THE SPECIMEN IN QUESTION HELPS VERY EO8ON CERTAIN STONY AND METALLINE SUBSTANCES C MUCH TO EXPLAIN THE ABOVE CIRCUMSTANCE INASMUCH AS MANY OF THE NODULES OF THE TRANSPARENT SUBSTANCE BELONGING TO IT ARE IN A STATE OF REAL DECOMPOSITION IN THAT STATE THEY ARE CHANGED INTO A WHITE OPAQUE SUBSTANCE WHICH UPON BEING LIGHTLY PRESSED OR SQUEEZED BETWEEN THE FINGERS CRUMBLES INTO A GRITTY DRY POWDER THIS DECOMPOSITION MAY BE OBSERVED TO HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN VARIOUS DEGREES IN MANY OF THE NODULES THE SUB STANCE IS MERELY BECOME FRIABLE WITHOUT BEING MUCH ALTERED IN ITS APPEARANCE WHEREAS SOME OF THOSE WHICH ARE IN A STATE OF COMPLETE DECOMPOSITION ARE OF AN OCHREOUS REDDISH YELLOW COLOUR IT IS HOWEVER EASY TO DISTINGUISH THAT THIS COLOUR DOES NOT BELONG TO THEM BUT IS OWING ONLY TO THE OXIDIZEMENT OF THE ADJACENT PARTICLES OF IRON FROM THE ABOVE OBSERVATIONS IT WILL NOT BE DIFFICULT TO CONCEIVE THE POSSIBILITY OF THE TOTAL OR NEARLY TOTAL DESTRUCTION OF THE TRANSPARENT SUBSTANCE AND ALSO THE APPEARANCE THE PIECES OF IRON MUST NATURALLY PRESENT WHEN DEPRIVED OF IT I CANNOT HELP OBSERVING LIKEWISE THAT THERE APPEARS TO EXIST A VERY INTERESTING ANALOGY BETWEEN THESE TRANSPARENT NODULES AND THE GLOBULES I DESCRIBED AS MAKING PART OF THE STONES SAID TO HAVE FALLEN ON THE EARTH THIS ANALOGY THOUGH NOT A VERY STRONG ONE MAY LEAD US TO SUPPOSE THAT THE TWO SUBSTANCES ARE SIMILAR IN THEIR NATURE BUT THAT THE GLOBULES ARE LESS PURE AND CONTAIN A GREATER QUANTITY OF IRON THE NATIVE IRON FROM BOHEMIA IS A COMPACT MASS SIMILAR TO THE COMPACT PART OF THE LARGE SPECIMEN OF IRON FROM SIBERIA WHICH HAS JUST BEEN DESCRIBED LIKE THAT ALSO IT CONTAINS A NUMBER OF GLOBULAR BODIES OR NODULES BUT THEY ARE NOT IN SUCH GREAT PROPORTION AS IN THE SIBERIAN IRON THEY ARE BESIDES PERFECTLY OPAQUE AND VERY MUCH RESEMBLE THE MOST COMPACT OF MDCCCI E E O9GMR HOWARDS EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS THE GLOBULES BELONGING TO THE STONES SAID TO HAVE FALLEN ON THE EARTH EXAMINATION OF THE IRON FROM SOUTH AMTERICA I HAVE ALREADY OBSERVED THAT MY EXPERIMENTS COINCIDED WITH THOSE OF MR PROUST HE OBTAINED 50 GRAINS OF SULPHATE OF NICKEL FROM IOO OF THIS MASS THE PROCESS I HAVE SO FREQUENTLY MENTIONED YIELDED ME 8O GRAINS OF OXIDE OF IRON FROM 62 OF THE METAL WHICH INDICATES ABOUT 7I OF NICKEL OR ABOUT 1O PER CENT EXAMINATION OF THE SIBERIAN IRON LOO GRAINS OF THIS IRON GAVE 127 OF OXIDE OF IRON HENCE IT SHOULD CONTAIN ABOUT 17 PER CENT OF NICKEL THE YELLOW SUBSTANCE BELONGING TO THIS IRON WAS ANALYZED IN THE SAME WAY AS THE GLOBULAR BODIES AND THE EARTHY PARTS OF THE STONE FROM BENARES THE PROPORTIONS RESULTING FROM THE ANALYSIS OF 5O GRAINS AND FROM SOME PREVIOUS EXPERIMENTS ON OTHER PARTICLES WERE SILICA   27 MAGNESIA 13 OXIDE OF IRON 8 OXIDE OF NICKEL  49I EXAMINATION OF THE BOHEMIAN IRON 26 GRAINS OF THIS METAL LEFT ABOUT 1 GRAIN OF EARTHY MATTER INSOLUBLE IN NITRIC ACID AND BY AMMONIA AFFORDED 30 GRAINS OF OXIDE OF IRON INDUCING AN ESTIMATION OF NEARLY 5 OF NICKEL 210ON CERTAIN STONY AND METALLINE SUBSTANCES C EXAMINATION OF IRON FROM SENEGAL BROTUGHT BY GENERAL OHARA AND GIVEN TO ME BY MR HATCHETT IN THIS EXPERIMENT 199 GRAINS OF OXIDE WERE PRODUCED FROM 145 GRAINS OF METAL HENCE THERE MAY BE AN ESTIMATION OF 8 GRAINS IN 145 OR BETWEEN 5 AND 6 PER CENT OF NICKEL IT WILL APPEAR FROM A COLLECTED VIEW OF THE PRECEDING PAGES AND AUTHORITIES THAT A NUMBER OF STONES ASSERTED TO HAVE FALLEN UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE PRECISELY THE SAME CHARACTERS THE STONES FROM BENARES THE STONE FROM YORKSHIRE THAT FROM SIENNA AND A FRAGMENT OF ONE FROM BOHEMIA HAVE A RELATION TO EACH OTHER NOT TO BE QUESTIONED IST THEY HAVE ALL PYRITES OF A PECULIAR CHARACTER EDLY THEY HAVE ALL A COATING OF BLACK OXIDE OF IRON 3DLY THEY ALL CONTAIN AN ALLOY OF IRON AND NICKEL AND 4THLY THE EARTHS WHICH SERVE TO THEM AS A SORT OF CON NECTING MEDIUM CORRESPOND IN THEIR NATURE AND NEARLY IN THEIR PROPORTIONS MOREOVER IN THE STONES FROM BENARES PYRITES AND GLOBULAR BODIES ARE EXCEEDINGLY DISTINCT IN THE OTHERS THEY ARE MORE OR LESS DEFINITE AND THAT FROM SIENNA HAD ONE OF ITS GLOBULES TRANS PARENT METEORS OR LIGHTNING ATTENDED THE DESCENT OF THE STONES AT BENARES AND AT SIENNA SUCH COINCIDENCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE UNQUESTIONABLE AUTHORITIES I HAVE ADDUCED MUST I IMAGINE REMOVE ALL DOUBT AS TO THE DESCENT OF THESE STONY SUBSTANCES FOR TO DISBELIEVE ON THE MERE GROUND OF INCOMPRE HENSIBILITY WOULD BE TO DISPUTE MOST OF THE WORKS OF NATURE RESPECTING THE KINDS OF IRON CALLED NATIVE THEY ALL CONTAIN NICKEL THE MASS IN SOUTH AMERICA IS HOLLOW HAS CONCAVITIESAIS MR HOWARDS EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS C AND APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN IN A SOFT OR WELDING STATE BECAUSE IT HAS RECEIVED VARIOUS IMPRESSIONS THE SIBERIAN IRON HAS GLOBULAR CONCAVITIES IN PART FILLED WITH A TRANSPARENT SUBSTANCE WHICH THE PROPORTIONAL QUANTITY OF OXIDE OF IRON EXCEPTED HAS NEARLY THE COMPOSITION OF THE GLO BULES IN THE STONE FROM BENARES THE IRON FROM BOHEMIA ADHERES TO EARTHY MATTER STUDDED WITH GLOBULAR BODIES THE SENEGAL IRON HAD BEEN COMPLETELY MUTILATED BEFORE IT CAME UNDER MY EXAMINATION FROM THESE FACTS I SHALL DRAW NO CONCLUSION BUT SUBMIT THE FOLLOWING QUERIES IST HAVE NOT ALL FALLEN STONES AND WHAT ARE CALLED NATIVE IRONS THE SAME ORIGIN  SDLY ARE ALL OR ANY THE PRODUCE OR THE BODIES OF METEORS  AND LASTLY MIGHT NOT THE STONE FROM YORKSHIRE HAVE FORMED A METEOR IN REGIONS TOO ELEVATED TO BE DISCOVERED  SPECIMENS OF THE BENARES AND YORKSHIRE STONES HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED BY THE PRESIDENT IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM

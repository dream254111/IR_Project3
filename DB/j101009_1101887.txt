it became necessary for plaintiff to occasionally enter a pit under the press to adjust the machinery and that on the day of the accident it became necessary for him to go down in said pit to set tapes on the machine and that after adjusting the same and while still in the pit though plaintiff was exercising due care his hair caught in the machine resulting in the injury Subsequently the declaration was amended by inserting after the words adjusting the same the words plaintiff recognized that there was a defect some where in the rollers and in trying to locate the trouble which was a necessary duty of the plaintiff Held that it sufficiently appeared that it was part of plaintiffs duty to be under the press in his en deavor to locate the defect Ed NoteFor cases in point see vol 34

under defendants printing press to adjust some tapes and after adjusting the same and while still in the pit his hair was caught in the machinery The amended declara tion upon which trial was had alleged that after adjusting the tapes plaintiff recognized that there was a defect somewhere in the rollers and in trying to locate this trouble which was a necessary duty of plaintiff his hair caught etc the issue being not whether it was necessary for plaintiff to go into the pit while the machine was in operation but whether being already in the pit and having accom plished in safety the purpose for which he went in it was necessary that he remain and keep the machine in operation while making the investigation in the other end of the pit from where he adjusted the tapes Held that an instruction ignoring this issue and requiring the jury to find as a condition precedent to a verdict for defendant that it was not necessary that plaintiff should go into the pit while the machine was running was erroneous Ed NoteFor cases in point see vol 46 Cent Dig Trial  587 9 SameContributory NegligencePruximate CauseIn an ac tion by a servant for injuries it appeared that plaintiff entered a pit under defendants printing press for the purpose of examining the machinery that defendant had failed to perform its duty in providing an electric light in such pit but plaintiff was a man of experience and had entire control of the printing press and was well acquainted with all the conditions surrounding the dangers confronting him when he attempted in the dark to locate the trouble that plaintiff11 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER knew that he could not stand erect in the pit and by stooping he had accomplished part of the objects for which he entered and then by raising his head too high his hair caught in the machinery and the injury complained of resulted Held that plaintiffs negligence was the proximate cause of his injury Ed NoteFor cases in point see vol 34 Cent Dig Master and

Lett and 0 D Batchelor for plaintiff in error Bickford  Stuart and Ashby  Read for defendant in error CARDwEI J This is the sequel to the case of Newport News Publishing Co v Beaumeister reported in 102 Va 677 47 S E 821 At the first trial there was a verdict and judgment for 2000 in favor of the plaintiff which judgment on a writ of error to this court was reversed and the case remanded for a new trial At the second trial the plaintiff again prevailed and recovered the judgment for 4500 now under review The declaration on which the first trial was had alleged that in operating the printing press of the defendant company it be came necessary for the plaintiff to occasionally enter the pit under the press in order to adjust certain parts of the machine that it was the duty of the defendant company in the exercise of reasonable care to properly light the pit so that the plaintiff might with due caution on his part perform his duties therein that the defendant company failed to provide sufficient light in the pit for his safety though it had promised to do so and that in reliance on such promise plaintiff had continued in the defend ant companys employment that on the day of the accident it became necessary for him to go down in the said pit to set some tapes on the said machine and that after adjusting the same and while still in the pit though the plaintiff was exercising due and proper care his hair caught in the said machine etc Recognizing that the evidence on the former trial showed that the plaintiff had accomplished with safety the purpose for which he went into the pit when the case went back for a new trial 974 Apr19061 NEWPORT NEWS PUB CO V BEAUMEISTER his declaration was amended by inserting after adjusting the same the tapes the words plaintiff recognized that there was a defect somewhere in the rollers and in trying to locate the trouble which was a necessary duty of the plaintiff So that by the first declaration the duty which plaintiff claimed he was performing when injured was setting some tapes while by the amended declaration it was in trying to locate a trouble in the rollers To the amended declaration the defendant company demurred which demurrer was overruled and this ruling of the trial court is assigned as error The ground of the demurrer relied on is that the declaration as amended contains no allegation of necessity or duty on the part of the plaintiff to be under the press while it was in oper ation in his endeavor to locate a defect in the rollers We are of opinion that there is no merit in this contention Enough has been said of the declaration to show that it does allege the duty on the part of the plaintiff to be under the press in his endeavor to locate the defect in the rollers and when this allegation was read by the defendant company along with the other facts alleged it could not fail to understand that the allega tion meant that it was necessary for the plaintiff to be under the press while it was in motion in his endeavor to locate the defect in the rollers It is not incumbent upon a plaintiff to aver that he has not been guilty of contributory negligence nor is it neces sary to negative defenses that may possibly be interposed All that is required is that the declaration state the facts constituting the alleged cause of action with sufficient certainty to be under stood by the defendant who has to answer them by the jury who are to inquire into their truth and by the court which is to render judgment In other words if the declaration is sufficient to inform the defendant of the nature of the demand made against him and states such facts as will enable the court to say that if the facts are proved as alleged they establish a good cause of action it is sufficient Va etc Wheel Co v Harris 103 Va 708 49 S E 991 and authorities cited We think the amended declaration measures up to the re 2 975976 11 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Apr quirement of the rule adverted to and that the demurrer thereto was properly overruled The next error assigned is the action of the court in giving the following instruction for the plaintiff The jury are instructed that there is no legal limit to the damages they may award for personal injuries and that they are the judges of the extent of the damages which from the evi dence the plaintiff may be entitled to recover and in estimating such damages they may take into consideration his age his station in life his injury his physical and mental suffering aris ing from said injury his loss of wages for the time he has been prevented by said injuries from working and a proper com pensation for his being deprived by said injuries from following such calling or business as he could have followed but for said injuries but the damages may not exceed 10000 the amount claimed in the declaration This is practically the same instruction on the measure of dam ages that came under review in Norfolk etc Ry Co v Marpole 97 Va 599 34 S E 462 where the objections made to the in struction were 1 that it allowed the jury without special proof in fixing the plaintiffs damages to take into consideration his mental suffering and 2 that it intimated to the jury that they might award the sum of 10000 in the way of damages with out qualifying the statement by saying that this sum was only mentioned because it was the maximum amount claimed by the plaintiff This court was of opinion then as it is now that in so far as it relates to the amount of damages that the jury might allow the instruction is erroneous and calculated to mislead the jury but as we could not see that it had probably done so in that case and the judgment of the circuit court having to be re versed on other grounds we only took occasion in the opinion to comment on the instruction as follows We do not think that the instruction as a whole misled or could have misled the jury in estimating plaintiffs damages although it would have been better had the instruction simply told the jury that the plaintiff claimed 10000 and they were authorized to award such sum as the evidence justified not exceeding that amount The vital difference between that case and the case under con1906 NEWPORT NEWS PUB CO V BEAUMEISTtR sideration is in the first named there was nothing to indicate that the jury might have been misled by the instruction while here the significant fact appears that at the first trial of the case when the instruction in question was not given the jury awarded the plaintiff 2000 damages and at the second trial with this in struction before the jury he was awarded 4500 It is not complained that the instruction specified in detail the possible injuries suffered by the plaintiff to be considered in es timating his damages but that it was misleading to tell them in that connection that there is no legal limit to the damages they might award in other words that the instruction is misleading and calculated to misinform the jury that the law does not intend that a fair compensation for the injuries alone shall be given un der the evidence but that any amount named by the jury within the limit of damages claimed is the proper measure under the law Counsel for the plaintiff cite a number of cases in support of their contention that this court has repeatedly sanctioned the expression in an instruction that there is no legal limit to the damages that the jury may award for personal injuries but upon reference to those cases it will be seen that the question under consideration was whether or not the damages awarded were excessive and not the question here under consideration The expression is used in those cases there is no legal measure of damages but in its use is to be found no sanction of an in struction in an action for personal injuries that admits of the interpretation that there is no legal limit fixed by law to guide the jury in awarding damages other than the amount claimed in the declaration As was well said by Riely J in Richmond Ry etc Co v Garthright 92 Va 635 24 S E 269 32 L R A 220 53 Am St Rep 839 No method has yet been devised nor scales ad justed by which to measure or weigh and value in money the degrees of pain and anguish of a suffering human being nor ever likely to be But it was not meant there or by what has been said by this court in any other case so far as we have been able to find that juries are not to be in cases like this guided in arriv ing at the amount of damages by a due and proper consideration of what would be a fair compensation for the injury suffered and 97711 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER that fair compensation is not the legal limit to the damages which they may award As was said in the opinion by Joynes J in Peshine v Shepper son 17 Grat 484 94 Am Dec 468 When the trespass is com mitted without fraud oppression or other special aggravation the object of the law it is generally said is to give compensation for injury suffered and damages are restricted to that object In this case there could be no recovery of exemplary or puni tive damages as a protection to the public but only a suitable recompense for the injury sustained and we are of opinion that the instruction under consideration was in the form in which it was given clearly misleading and should not have been given Instruction T given for the plaintiff is also erroneous in view of the evidence in this case The established rule is that it is the masters duty to exercise ordinary care in seeing that the place assigned to his servant to work is kept in a reasonably safe and suitable condition for in most cases the master cannot dele gate that duty so as to relieve himself from liability N  W Ry Co v Phillips Admx 100 Va 362 41 S E 726 But that rule does not control where the person injured is himself to perform the duty of keeping the place where he is at work in a safe con dition R Cr Coal Co v Wells 96 Va 416 31 S E 614 In this case it clearly appeared in the plaintiffs evidence and in fact is admitted that it was the duty of the plaintiff to keep the pit clear of the accumulation of paper that rendered his move ments under the press more dangerous while the instruction is not applied to the light alone which it is alleged the defendant company had failed to furnish It makes no reference whatever to this admitted fact that the duty rested upon the plaintiff to prevent the accumulation of paper in the pit making his move ments under the press more dangerous and therefore the jury might have believed that the neglect of this duty on the part of the plaintiff contributed to his injury and yet understood from the instruction that they should find in his favor because of the neglect of the defendant company to furnish a sufficient light at the pit But it is contended that the evidence does not show that the accumulated paper increased the plaintiffs danger in the pit or that there was enough in there to warrant its removal and 978 Apr1906 NEWPORT NEWS PUB CO V BEAUMEISTER therefore the instruction could not have prejudiced the defend ant company This however is not borne out by the record There was evidence that with no accumulation of the paper in the pit the plaintiff could have stood erect therein and under the press with a clear space of at least half an inch between the top of his head and the tapes in which his hair was caught while with the accumulated paper under his feet he had to go to find out the trouble in the ink rollers stooping so low that he could see neither the tapes that caught his hair nor the ink rollers and while in that position he happened to raise his head too high resulting in his hair at the back part of his head being caught causing him to throw up his hand to extricate himself when it was caught in the machine and mashed Under these circumstances the instruc tion in telling the jury the duty rested upon the defendant com pany to see that the place assigned to the plaintiff to work was kept in a safe and suitable condition without any reference to the evidence tending to prove that it was his duty to keep the pit in which he received his injuries free from accumulated paper or to the evidence tending to prove that this neglect of duty on his part contributed to the injury was erroneous and well cal culated to mislead the jury and was not cured by any other instruction given The next assignment of error is to the refusal of the court to give instruction No 2 asked for by the defendant company Its purpose was to tell the jury that if the point where the acci dent happened was so dark that plaintiff could not see the tape which caught his hair or the cylinder which crushed his hand even if he had been looking for them he could not recover Instruction No 7 contains the same proposition of law more clearly and fully expressed Therefore the defendant company was not prejudiced by the refusal to give its instruction No 2 As has been stated the former declaration alleged that plaintiff went down into the pit to adjust some tapes and after adjusting the same and while still in the pit his hair was caught etc but did not say where he then was or what he was doing The amended declaration upon which the last trial was had alleges that after adjusting the tapes plaintiff recognized that there was a defect somewhere in the rollers and in trying to locate this trouble which was a necessary duty of the plaintiff his hair 97911 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER caught etc The issue under the declaration as amended was therefore not whether it was necessary for plaintiff to go into the pit while the machine was in operation but whether he being already in the pit and having accomplished in safety the purpose for which he went in it was necessary that he remain in there and keep the machine in operation while making the investigation of the rollers situated in the other end of the pit from where he adjusted the tapes which he says he was making at the time of the accident To meet these new conditions and in accordance with the views of this court when the case was here on the former writ of error the evidence being directed mainly to this phase of the case the defendant company asked for the following instruc tion numbered 3 An employee unnecessarily undertaking work in such a position that its performance is obviously dangerous or known by him to be dangerous when it could have been otherwise performed without danger in a way well known to the employee cannot recover for injuries occasioned thereby and if the jury believe from the evidence that the investiga tion of the trouble with the ink rollers which the plaintiff says he was making at the time of the injury could have been made after first stopping the machine or could have been made on the outside of the pit then the jury must find for the defendant This instruction was refused the court giving in lieu thereof with certain changes instruction No 6 refused at the last trial and ruled by this court to be correct as the case stood at the former trial Instruction No 3 contains a concise statement of the law of the case entirely applicable to the issue under the amended declaration and to the evidence bearing on that issue while No 6 given in its place required the jury to find as a condition pre cedent to a verdict for the defendant company that it was not necessary that the plaintiff should go into the pit while the ma chine was running which was not in issue the issue made under the amended declaration relating solely to the conduct of the plaintiff after going into the pit wholly uninfluenced by any thing that transpired prior thereto for when plaintiff went in and until he had finished adjusting the tapes which caused him to go in he was ignorant of the trouble which he was endeavoring to 980 Apr1906 NEWPORT NEWS PUB CO V BEAUMEISTER remedy at the time of his injury As was said by counsel for the defendant company the necessary effect of directing the con sideration of the jury to the necessity of going into the pit and the danger attendant thereon was to divert their minds from the real issuethe prudence of plaintiffs conduct with relation to what transpired in the pit after adjusting the folding tapesand to fix their attention on the prudence of the conduct of plaintiff in relation to the adjustment of the tapes which was the real issue at the former trial before the declaration was amended but which under the amended declaration has become a mere matter of inducement It was sought by instruction No 3 to submit plainly and fairly to the jury the question whether or not it was necessary to locate the defect in the ink rollers without first stopping the machine unhampered and unincumbered by any issue concern ing the tapes such issue not being pertinent at this trial and we are of opinion that it was error to refuse it and to give in its place instruction No 6 Instruction No 3 having been refused the defendant com panys instruction No 4 which stated in different form the proposition enunciated in No 3 should have been given but at another trial of the case it will not be necessary to give both We do not consider it necessary to pass upon the question pre sented in bill of exceptions No 4 as it is not likely to arise at the next trial The remaining assignment of error is the refusal of the court to set aside the verdict of the jury and grant a new trial on the ground that the verdict is contrary to the law and the evidence The plaintiff has established the duty of the defendant com pany to provide the electric light alleged to have been necessary for use in examining and adjusting the machinery of the print ing press in the pit and its failure to do so whereby the plaintiff would be entitled to recover damages in this action for the in juries he sustained unless it appears from the evidence viewed under the familiar rule governing its consideration that his own negligence was the proximate cause of the injury or contributed thereto The plaintiff was a man of experience and had entire control of the printing press when he received the injuries for which he 98111 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER sues and no one knew better than he the conditions surrounding and the dangers confronting him when he attempted in the dark to locate the trouble in the ink rollers As said in the opinion of this court Newport News etc Co v Beaumeister supra the absence of the light increased the danger and imposed upon the plaintiff enlarged obligations to exercise due care and caution in the performance of his duty Notwithstanding the darkness and the promise of the master to repair the light there was the absolutely safe way of repairing the defect in the machine and the question arises whether the plaintiff did not owe to his mas ter as well as to himself the duty of adopting the method of doing the work with respect to which there was no danger To meet the contention of the defendant company that the defect or trouble in the ink rollers which the plaintiff says he was trying to detect when he was injured could have been de tected after the machine had been stopped or from the outside of the pit we have only his statement that it could not be done but he states no facts to show this and therefore what he says on that point is but an expression of an opinion But were it conceded that he was right in the statement he makes the ques tion remains Was it necessary or his duty to expose himself to the known danger of going under the press in the dark to find the cause of the defect in the work it was doing and which appears from his evidence to have been trivial It would serve no good purpose to review the evidence in de tail Leaving wholly out of view that part of it tending to prove that his neglect of duty in allowing the paper to accumulate in the bottom of the pit in consequence of which he could not walk under the machine without stooping and could not tell how near to the machine his head was when in that position contributed to his injury there is no getting away from the admissions he makes in giving his own evidence that it was not safe in the pit under the machine at the west end where he was without a light that he could not see the ink rollers he went to inspect and had to walk under and would not say that he could have seen his hand two inches before his face that the trouble when lo cated could not be remedied with the machine in motion that he had to go in a stooping position when looking for it and that in raising his head in passing under the ink rollers he was liable 982 Apr1906 NEWPORT NEWS PUB CO V BEAUMEISTER to come in contact with them When asked Well how could you calculate in the dark just how far you could raise your head without striking them the rollers he answered I didnt know I just stooped way low His witness Vaiden also states that it was dangerous under the machine where the plaintiff was hurt without a light The following questions and answers ap pear in plaintiffs own evidence Q Could you see the ink rollers at all A No sir Q Was there light enough there if you had looked for you to have seen the tape which caught your hair A When Q At the time your hair was caught or just prior thereto if you had looked for the tape would you have seen it A No sir If the contention of his counsel that he was speaking of not being able to see the tapes and ink tollers be cause of his stooping position could be accepted it would all the more show his recklessness in putting himself in that position There are times when an employee may incur extraordinary risks and not relieve his employer from liability for an injury he thereby sustains as when it is necessary in order to save the lives of others or to prevent injury to them or to the employers prop erty and perhaps other instances might be given but that was not the situation when the plaintiff exposed himself on the occa sion of his injury No consequences of importancecertainly none seriouswould have resulted if he had refused as he should have done to go to the dangerous place under the print ing press or had he pursued the absolutely safe course of stop ping the machinery before attempting to detect and adjust the trouble in the ink rollers It is true that he claims that he could not have detected the trouble in the ink rollers which caused the defect in the paper being printed with the machine stopped or from the outside of the pit but it is also true as shown by his own admissions that he could not have discovered the trouble in the ink rollers in the darkness there and therefore he need lessly and recklessly went into a place of danger to accomplish what as he well knew he could not accomplish without sufficient light He undertook to enter a place where he had to go in a stooping position with his eyes down If there had been a blaze of light he could not have seen the ink rollers in that position In undertaking to raise his eyes to look he made the mistake of 98311 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER raising his head too high resulting in the injury to him for which under the circumstances his employer is not responsible It was said by Judge Cooley in Sjogren v Hall 53 Mich 274 278 18 N W 812 814 quoted by Buchanan J with approval in Persingers Admx v A Ore etc Co 102 Va 354 46 S E 326 So far as there is a duty resting upon the proprietor in such cases it is a duty to guard against probable danger and it does not go to the extent of requiring him to render accidental injury impossible    If the fact that prevention was possible is to render the employer liable then he may as well be made an insurer of the safety of those in his service in express terms for to all intents and purposes he would in law be insurer whether nominally so or not The opinion in Persingers Admx v A Ore etc Co supra says It is right that the master should be required to antici pate and guard against consequences that may reasonably be expected to occur but it would violate every principle of justice or law if he should be compelled to foresee and provide against that which reasonable and prudent men would not expect to hap pen Terminal Co v McCormick 104 Va  51 S E 731 In Ches  O Ry Co v Hafners Admr 90 Va 621 19 S E 166 it was held that the railroad company was not liable for the death of Hafner who was struck by the fourth sill of a danger ously low bridge after he had passed in safety under the three first sills by stooping and lowering his head when he had full knowledge of the dangerous character of the bridge and the accident was due to his negligently raising his head too soon his own negligence being the proximate cause of the injury Dis cussing the evidence as to Hafners conduct at the time of the accident the opinion by Lacy J says He did not stoop low enough all the way under the bridge but negligently raised his head too soon and was struck while others situated precisely as he was did stoop low enough and were unharmed This was clearly contributory negligence on his part which was the prox imate cause of his injury and he cannot recover    There the negligence charged was the keeping and maintaining a dangerously low bridge under which the employees of the company had to pass in the discharge of their duties but it was Apr 9841906 NEWPORT NEWS PUB CO V BEAU MEISTER considered that while the company was in this respect negligent the accident to Hafner was due to his want of proper care for his own safety in passing under the bridge While it was negligence on the part of the defendant com pany not to restore the electric light for use under its printing press clearly the injury to plaintiff was not due to that negli gence but to his negligence in not exercising due care for his own safety when in a place of known danger to the mistake of raising his head too high when he knew he was liable to come in contact with the machinery above himan accident which the defendant company could not have foreseen as liable to happen and provided against by the exercise of any sort of care on its part We are of opinion that the plaintiffs own palpable negligence was the proximate cause of his injury and that the circuit court erred in not setting aside the verdict of the jury as contrary to the law and the evidence Therefore its judgment must be reversed and annulled the verdict of the jury set aside and the cause remanded for a new trial 985

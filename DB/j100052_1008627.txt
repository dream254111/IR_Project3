J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1008627,THE BASIS OF THE DEMAND FOR PUBLIC REGULATION OF INDUSTRIES,I242473,ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE JANUARY 1892 THE BASIS OF THE DEMAND FOR PUBLIC REGULATION OF INDUSTRIES IN THE INDUSTRIAL OPERATIONS OF MODERN SOCIETY NO TEN DENCY IS MORE OBSERVABLENONE IT MAY BE SAID HAS ADVANCED SO FARAS THAT TOWARDS SPECIALIZATION OF FUNCTION THE RESULT HAS BEEN THAT THE NEEDS OF CIVILIZED LIFE HAVE BEEN FAR MORE PERFECTLY MET AND SUPPLIED THAN WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE THIS SEPARATION OF FUNCTIONS IS IN FACT A MANIFESTATION OF A GENERAL LAW OF SOCIAL EVOLUTION IT IS THE IMPERATIVE REQUIREMENT AND THE NECESSARY CONDITION OF ADVANCED HUMAN SOCIETY HAND IN HAND STEP BY STEP WITH ADVANCING CIVILIZATION THE DIVISION OF LABORDIFFERENTIATION OF FUNCTIONHAS PROCEEDED FURNISHING AT ONCE THE MOST STRIKING PHENOMENON OF INDUSTRIAL PROGRESS AND THE MOST POWERFUL AID TO ITS FURTHER ACHIEVEMENTS AND YET INCALCULABLE AS HAVE BEEN THE BENEFITS TO MANKIND HENCE RESULTING IMPOSSIBLE AS HUMAN ADVANCEMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNDER OTHER CONDITIONS AND UNDENIABLE AS HAS 4332 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY BEEN THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE CONDITIONS OF THE MASSES OF SOCIETY AS COMPARED WITH FORMER TIMES IT CANNOT ESCAPE OBSERVATION THAT WHAT CONSTITUTES THE STRENGTH AND PROGRES SIVE POWER OF SOCIETY AS A WHOLE CONSTITUTES ALSO IN A SENSE THE WEAKNESS OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND OFTEN INVOLVES UNFORTU NATE DISPARITY BETWEEN MAN AND MAN DIFFERENT INDUSTRIAL CLASSES HAVE ARISEN AND THE DEPENDENCE OF CLASS UPON CLASS HAS INCREASED ALMOST BEYOND CONCEPTION BUT THE RECIPROCITY OF DEPENDENCE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS OF DIFFERENT CLASSES HAS IN MANY CASES BEEN WELLNIGH DESTROYED UNDER SOCIAL CONDITIONS WHICH WOULD NOW BE CALLED PRIMI TIVE BUT WHICH NEVERTHELESS SUPPLY ALL THE NECESSITIES AND MANY OF THE ENJOYMENTS OF LIFE THE CIRCLE OF DEPENDENCIES IF THE EXPRESSION MAY BE USED IS OFTEN VERY LIMITED FOR ILLUSTRATIONS OF THIS FACT IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO REVERT TO A REMOTE PAST OR TO AN EARLY AND PRIMITIVE PERIOD OF CIVILIZED LIFE IN MANY OF OUR OLDER STATES MAY BE FOUND TODAY COMMUNITIES REMOTE FROM CONTACT WITH THE THROBBING ENER GIES AND INSATIABLE ASPIRATIONS OF MODEM PROGRESS ISOLATED BY PHYSICAL BARRIERS FROM THE GREAT WORLD BEYOND THEM LIVING FOR THE MOST PART IN SIMPLE INDEPENDENCE OF THE REST OF MANKIND IN SUCH COMMUNITIES SPECIALIZATION HAS MADE BUT LITTLE PROGRESS THE TASTES OF THE PEOPLE ARE SIMPLE AND THEIR WANTS ARE FEW THE SOIL RUDELY CULTIVATED WITH ANTI QUATED IMPLEMENTS YIELDS A SUFFICIENCY OF VEGETABLE FOOD FOR MAN AND BEAST THE PRODUCT OF THE CHASE AND THE TRIBUTE OF THE STREAM SUPPLEMENT THE SCANTY STOCK OF DOMESTIC ANIMAL FOOD THE NEIGHBORING FOREST YIELDING TO THE BLOWS OF THE AXENO OTHER IMPLEMENT IS NEEDEDFURNISHES THE LOGS AND THE RUDELY RIVEN BOARDS FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE DWELLING A PATCH OF COTTON OR OF FLAX AND HALF A DOZEN SHEEP TO EACH FAMILY YIELD THE RAW MATERIAL WHICH HAND CARDS SPINNINGWHEELS AND ANCESTRAL HANDLOOMS CONVERT INTO AMPLE CLOTHING FOR THE PEOPLE USUALLY WITH THE OCCA SIONAL AID OF A NEIGHBOR EACH HOUSEHOLD CAN PERFORM WITHIN AND FOR ITSELF MOST OF THE SIMPLE FUNCTIONS WHICH ARE NECES SARY FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF SUCH A LIFE AS IS HERE DESCRIBED 434PUBUIC REGULATION OF INDUSTRIES EVERY MAN IS HIS OWN FARMER HERDSMAN HUNTSMAN CLOTHIER BUILDER SUCH FOOD SHELTER AND RAIMENT AS HE HAS ARE THE PRODUCT OF HIS OWN ALMOST UNAIDED EXERTIONS THE FUNC TIONS OF SUCH A SOCIETY ARE BUT SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTIATED SUCH INTERDEPENDENCIES AS EXIST EXIST DIRECTLY BETWEEN MAN AND MAN EACH INDIVIDUAL CLEARLY PERCEIVES HIS OWN EQUAL DEPENDENCE UPON OR INDEPENDENCE OF OTHER INDIVIDUALS THE INDUSTRIAL EQUILIBRIUM IS MAINTAINED BY FORCES OPERATING DIRECTLY BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND CLASS DISTINCTIONS ARE ALMOST UNKNOWN AMONG THE MOST STRIKING CHARACTERISTICS OF SUCH A COMMUNITY ARE THE SOCIAL EQUALITY OF ITS MEMBERS AND THE COMPARATIVELY EQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF ITS WEALTH AND THIS CONDITION OF INDUSTRIAL INDEPENDENCE CONTAINS WITHIN ITSELF ELEMENTS OF CONTENTMENT OF INDIVIDUAL HAPPI NESS AND OF GOOD CITIZENSHIP WHICH IN THE MARCH OF PRO GRESS AND THE ADVANCE OF CIVILIZATION HAVE VANISHED AWAY STRIKES AND LOCKOUTS LABOR ORGANIZATIONS AND TRUSTS THOSE INEVITABLE AND UNHAPPY CONCOMITANTS OF PROGRESS HAVE NO PLACE IN A SIMPLE SOCIETY THE VERY SENSE OF INDUSTRIAL INDEPENDENCE THE KNOWLEDGE OF EVERY MAN THAT WITHIN HIM SELF OR AT MOST WITHIN A SMALL CIRCLE OF KNOWN EQUAL AND MUTUAL DEPENDENCIES EXISTS THE MEANS OF SUPPORTING LIFE AND SUPPLYING AT LEAST ITS MORE ELEMENTARY WANTS IS THE MOST SUBSTANTIAL BASIS OF SOCIAL CONTENTMENT AND STABILITY BUT HOWEVER DESIRABLE IN ITSELF INDUSTRIAL INDEPENDENCE MAY BE IT IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH HIGH INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT HE WHO ATTEMPTS THE PERFORMANCE OF MANY FUNCTIONS WILL PERFORM NONE OF THEM IN A COMPLETE AND SATISFACTORY MANNER JACK AT ALL TRADES AND MASTER OF NONE IS THE POPULAR PROVERB WHICH EXPRESSES THE GENERAL APPRECIATION OF THIS FACT AND THE SMALLER THE CIRCLE OF DEPENDENCIES THE GREATER THE NUMBER OF FUNCTIONS EACH MEMBER OF THE CIRCLE MUST PERFORM AND THE MORE UNSATISFACTORY AND INCOMPLETE WILL BE THE PERFORMANCE HENCE INDUSTRIAL PROGRESS NECESSARILY INVOLVES THE CON TINUED EXPANSION OF THE CIRCLE OF DEPENDENCIES AND FROM THIS RESULTS THE GROWING RELATIVE INEQUALITIES IN SOCIETY 435 34 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY WHICH CONSTITUTES ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS OF SOCIAL PROBLEMS WITHOUT ANY PREVIOUS UNDERSTANDING OR CONCERT OF ACTION BY A MOVEMENT OF WHICH MOST OF THE PARTICIPANTS IN IT ARE QUITE UNCONSCIOUS THOSE FUNCTIONS WHICH ARE MORE COMPLEX IN CHARACTER ARE GRADUALLY RELINQUISHED BY THE MASSES AND ARE ASSUMED BY DISTINCT CLASSES AS SOCIAL FUNCTIONS ARE FURTHER DIFFERENTIATED THOSE CLASSES BECOME MORE NUMEROUS AND MORE DISTINCT AND FREQUENTLY FUNCTIONS OF THE HIGHEST CONSEQUENCE TO ALL COME TO BE PERFORMED BY A COMPARATIVELY SMALL CLASS OF WORKERS GRADUALLY THE CIRCLE OF DEPENDEN CIES IS DIVIDED INTO DISTINCT INDUSTRIAL SEGMENTS THE LARGEST OF WHICH IF THE CIRCLE IS COMPLETE IS FOUND TO BE OCCUPIED WITH THE EXERCISE OF THOSE FUNDAMENTAL FUNCTIONS WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE MAINTENANCE OF INDIVIDUAL EXISTENCE NOT ONLY IN THAT PARTICULAR SEGMENT BUT IN ALL OTHER PARTS OF THE CIRCLE OTHER SEGMENTS OF GREATLY DIMINISHED SIZE ARE SEEN TO DIS CHARGE FUNCTIONS TOWARDS THE WHOLE EACH OF WHICH IMPLIES AN ADVANCE IN THE SCALE OF CIVILIZATION WITH THE NEW WANTS WHICH CIVILIZATION CREATES AND THE MEANS OF SATISFACTION WHICH IT PROVIDES CONSIDERING THEN INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY AS A WHOLE AND ITS DEPENDENCE UPON FUNCTIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN THUS DIFFEREN TIATED AND SPECIALIZED IT WILL BE OBSERVED THAT UNDER COMPLEX SOCIAL CONDITIONS THE MUTUALITY AND EQUALITY OF DEPENDENCE WHICH UNDER SIMPLE CONDITIONS EXIST BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS ARE IN RESPECT OF MANY IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS TRANSFERRED FROM INDIVIDUALS TO THE SEPARATE INTEGRAL SEGMENTS OF THE INDUSTRIAL CIRCLE SIMILARLY ON EXAMINING THE SEVERAL INDUSTRIAL SEGMENTS SEPARATELY IT IS MANIFEST THAT IN NONE OF THEM DOES EQUALITY EXIST BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUALS COMPOSING IT THE LEAST INE QUALITY PREVAILS IN THAT SEGMENT WHICH PERFORMS THE PRIMARY FUNCTIONS OF SOCIETY AND THE INEQUALITY OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE DIFFERENT SEGMENTS GENERALLY BECOMES GREATER AND GREATER AS THE FUNCTIONS PERFORMED BY THOSE SEGMENTS BECOME MORE COMPLEX AND FARTHER REMOVED FROM THE PRIMARY FUNCTIONS IN POINT OF FACT A PROCESS TAKES PLACE IN EACH SEGMENT OF 436PUBLIC REGULATION OF INDUSTRIES SEPARATION INTO SUBSEGMENTS MORE OR LESS DISTINCT INTO WHICH THE FUNCTIONS OF THE MAIN SEGMENT ARE DIFFERENTIATED AND SPECIALIZED THE GENERAL LAW OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND MAINTAINS A PROPER EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN THE SEVERAL SEGMENTS AND SUBSEGMENTS CONSIDERED AS ENTIRETIES BUT AS THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS COMPOSING THE DIFFERENT SEGMENTS AND SUBSEGMENTS VARIES IM MENSELYBEING VERY GREAT IN SOME AND VERY SMALL IN OTHERS IT FOLLOWS THAT THE AVERAGE INDIVIDUAL IN THE LARGER SEG MENT IS FAR MORE DEPENDENT ON THE AVERAGE INDIVIDUAL IN THE SMALLER THAN THE LATTER IS UPON THE FORMER THE PRINCIPLE WHICH UNDERLIES AND EXPLAINS INDIVIDUAL INEQUALITY IN INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY BROADLY STATED IS THAT CERTAIN FUNCTIONS NECESSARY TO ALL CAN BE BEST DISCHARGED AND ARE IN FACT DISCHARGED BY A FEW WHILE OTHER FUNCTIONS NECESSARY TO ALL ARE IN FACT DISCHARGED BY MANY EQUALITY OF DEPENDENCE EXISTS BETWEEN THE FEW COLLECTIVELY ON THE ONE SIDE AND THE MANY ON THE OTHER BUT CONSEQUENT DISPARITY EXISTS BETWEEN THE AVERAGE INDIVIDUAL OF THE FEW AND THE AVERAGE INDIVIDUAL OF THE MANY COMBINATION AMONG THE FEW INCREASES THE RELA TIVE DEPENDENCE OF THE MANY AND CAN ONLY BE COUNTERACTED BY COMBINATION AMONG THE MANY OR BY SOMETHING EQUIVA LENT THERETO BUT COMBINATION AMONG A FEW IS EASY AND COMBINATION AMONG MANY IS DIFFICULT MOREOVER COMBINA TION OF CLASS AGAINST CLASS IMPLIES ANTAGONISM AND ITSELF FREQUENTLY ENGENDERS STILL FURTHER ANTAGONISM BETWEEN THE CLASSES AND ANTAGONISM BETWEEN CLASSES WHOSE COOPERA TION IS ESSENTIAL TO THE PROPER DISCHARGE OF ANY FUNCTION IMPLIES A FAILURE OF THAT FUNCTION AND APART FROM THE MERITS OF THE CONTROVERSY AS BETWEEN THE IMMEDIATE PARTIES TO IT OTHER AND VASTLY LARGER CLASSES MAY SUFFER FROM THE FAILURE OF THE FUNCTION UPON WHOSE PROPER DISCHARGE THEY HAVE BECOME DEPENDENT HOW TO HARMONIZE INDUSTRIAL PROGRESS WITH A REASONABLE DEGREE OF SECURITY IN THE MASSES AGAINST THE ARBITRARY ACTION OF A FEW WHO IN EVERY ADVANCED SOCIETY INEVITABLY ACQUIRE EXCLUSIVE CONTROL OF INDUSTRIAL FUNCTIONS OF GREAT CONSE 437 56 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY QUENCE TO ALL IS THEN A PROBLEM WELL WORTHY OF CONSIDERA TION BEFORE VENTURING ANY SUGGESTION AS TO THE DIRECTION IN WHICH A SOLUTION SEEMS LIKELY TO BE SOUGHT AND WITHOUT MEANING TO IMPLY THAT IT IS THE RIGHT DIRECTION IT WILL BE WELL TO ILLUSTRATE THE FOREGOING GENERAL OBSERVATIONS BY REFER ENCE TO A FEW SALIENT FEATURES IN THE INDUSTRIAL SITUATION OF OUR OWN COUNTRY THE GREAT AND GROWING INEQUALITY IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE NATIONAL WEALTH IS FREQUENTLY CHARGED TO OUR RESTRICTIVE COMMERCIAL POLICY AND TO SOME EXTENT THE CHARGE MAY BE WELL FOUNDED BUT THE INEQUALITY IS FAR MORE LARGELY DUE TO THE NECESSARY AND INHERENT CONDITIONS OF INDUSTRIAL PROGRESS INDEED SOME OF THE MOST CONSPICUOUS EXAMPLES OF MONOPOLY AND POWER ON THE ONE HAND AND OF DEPENDENCE ON THE OTHER ARE DISPLAYED UNDER CONDITIONS WHICH LEGAL RESTRICTIONS HAVE NOT ONLY NOT FAVORED BUT HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO PREVENT OBSERVE THEN IN CONNECTION WITH WHAT HAS BEEN SAID THE THREE GREAT DIVISIONS OF INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY IN THE UNITED STATESTHE AGRICULTURAL THE COMMERCIAL AND MANUFACTUR INGAND A FEW OF THEIR MOST DISTINCT AND CONSPICUOUS SUB DIVISIONS WHILE AGRICULTURE MANUFACTURES AND COMMERCE ARE USUALLY REFERRED TO AS CONSTITUTING THE PRINCIPAL INDUS TRIAL CLASSES OF A NATION INCLUDING GRAZING UNDER THE GENERAL TERM AGRICULTURE AND MINING UNDER THE GENERAL HEAD OF MANUFACTURES YET THERE IS IN EVERY CIVILIZED COUNTRY A VAST NUMBER OF PERSONS ENGAGED IN VARIOUS OCCUPATIONS WHO CAN NOT BE CLASSED UNDER ANY OF THE FORE GOING HEADS IN THE UNITED STATES CENSUS THESE ARE CLASSI FIED UNDER THE GENERAL HEAD OF PERSONS ENGAGED IN PROFES SIONAL AND PERSONAL SERVICES BUT WHILE THEY EXERCISE FUNC TIONS OF VERY GREAT SOCIAL IMPORTANCE AND WHILE A FEW OF THEM ENJOY VERY GREAT SOCIAL AND POLITICAL INFLUENCE YET THE MOST CONSPICUOUS RELATIONS OF THE AGRICULTURAL COMMERCIAL AND MANUFACTURING CLASSES TO EACH OTHER AND THE MOST OBVIOUS FEATURES IN THE INTERNAL ORGANIZATION OF EACH CLASS MAY BE TREATED WITHOUT CONSIDERING PERSONS ENGAGED IN PROFES SIONAL AND PERSONAL SERVICES 438PUBLIC REGULATION OF INDUSTRIES AGRICULTURE IS OF COURSE THE FUNDAMENTAL AND PRIMARY FUNCTION UPON THE EFFICACY AND ADEQUATE DISCHARGE OF WHICH ALL CLASSES ARE ULTIMATELY DEPENDENT IT IS THE LARGEST OF THE INDUSTRIAL SEGMENTS AND HAS MADE THE LEAST PROGRESS IN SPECIALIZATION THE 7670493 PERSONS ENGAGED IN AGRICULTURE IN THE UNITED STATES IN I880 ARE BY THE CENSUS OF THAT YEAR DIVIDED INTO ONLY TWELVE CLASSES SOME OF WHICH ARE VERY INSIGNIFICANT THE MOST IMPORTANT BEING FARMERS AND PLANTERS NUMBERING 4225925 AND AGRICULTURAL LABOR ERS NUMBERING 3323876 COMMERCE OR THE EXCHANGE OF PRODUCTS WITH ALL THE AGENCIES AND INSTRUMENTALITIES OF EXCHANGES IS AN INDUSTRIAL FUNCTION OF THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE YET LESS ESSENTIAL THAN AGRICULTURE IT IMPLIES AN ADVANCE IN INDUSTRIAL EVOLUTION AND IS MORE HIGHLY DIFFERENTIATED THAN AGRICULTURE THE PERSONS ENGAGED IN COMMERCE IN THE UNITED STATES UNDER THE HEAD OF TRADE AND TRANSPORTATION NUMBERING 18 IO 256 ARE BY THE CENSUS OF I880 SUBDIVIDED INTO SEVENTYONE CLASSES  MANUFACTURING MINING AND MECHANICAL INDUSTRIES DE NOTING STILL FURTHER INDUSTRIAL ADVANCEMENT OCCUPY IN THE UNITED STATES OR DID IN I880 3137812 PERSONS AND ARE BY THE SAME AUTHORITY SUBDIVIDED INTO ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX CLASSES THE TENDENCY TOWARDS SPECIALIZATION IT IS THUS SEEN HAS GROWN WITH INDUSTRIAL PROGRESS AND IS STRONGEST IN THE SEG MENT OF MOST COMPLEX FUNCTIONS IN COMMERCE AND MANU FACTURES THE SPECIALIZATION IS OFTEN SO COMPLETE THAT SOME DISTINCT BRANCHES OF INDUSTRY UNDER ONE OR THE OTHER OF THOSE HEADS THOUGH CONTROLLED BY A COMPARATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF PERSONS APPEAR TO CONSTITUTE IN THEMSELVES SEPARATE AND ESSENTIAL INDUSTRIAL SEGMENTS UPON WHICH ALL OR VERY MANY OTHERS ARE DEPENDENT ILLUSTRATIONS ARE FOUND IN WAREHOUSE AND STORAGE FACILITIES UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES IN TELE GRAPHIC SERVICE IN RAILROAD TRANSPORTATION IN THE PRODUCTION OF DRESSED MEATS IN THE PRODUCTION OF ILLUMINATING OIL IN SUGAR REFINING IN THE PRODUCTION OF IRON AND STEEL AND IN 4391 78 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY MANY MANUFACTURES THEREOF AND TO A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT IN THE MANUFACTURE OF OTHER ARTICLES ESSENTIAL TO THE DUE WELFARE OF ADVANCED INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY RECURRING NOW FOR A MOMENT TO THE AGRICULTURAL SEGMENT THIS STRIKING FACT IS NOTICEABLE THAT THE FARMERS AND PLANTERS IN THE COUNTRY AT LARGE OUTNUMBER THE  AGRICUL TURAL LABORERS THE EMPLOYER CLASS IS NUMERICALLY GREATER THAN THE EMPLOYE CLASS UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES OPPRESSIVE CONDUCT OF EMPLOYER TOWARDS ENMPLOYE MUST AS A GENERAL RULE BE IMPOSSIBLE AND A FAIR SHARE OF THE AVERAGE PRODUCT IS ASSURED TO THE LATTER FOR HIS SERVICES AGRICUL TURAL LABORERS  OUTNUMBER FARMERS AND PLANTERS ONLY IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC AND GULF STATES FROM MARYLAND TO LOUISIANA INCLUSIVE AND IN TENNESSEE THIS AT LEAST WAS THE CASE IN I88O EVEN AT THAT TIME THE NUMBERS OF EACH CLASS WERE NEARLY BALANCED IN SEVERAL OF THESE STATES AND AS A CONSIDERABLE SUBDIVISION OF LANDED PROPERTY HAS TAKEN PLACE SINCE THEN THE CENSUS JUST TAKEN WILL PROBABLY SHOW A REVERSAL OF MAJORITIES IN SOME OF THEM IN NO STATE DOES THE PROPORTION OF LABORERS TO FARMERS REACH THREE TO ONE AND IN THE LEADING AGRICULTURAL STATES OF THE WEST THE PROPORTION IS SOMETHING LIKE ONE TO TWO HENCE EXCEPT WHERE RACE CON STITUTES AN INDESTRUCTIBLE BASIS OF SOCIAL DISTINCTION THE FARMER AND HIS HIRED LABORERS ARE USUALLY FOUND ASSOCIATING ON TERMS OF EQUALITY AND THE RECIPROCITY OF DEPENDENCE BETWEEN THEM IS SUFFICIENTLY MANIFEST EVEN WHERE DIFFERENCE OF RACE CREATES SOCIAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE PLANTER AND HIS HIRE LING IT IS DOUBTFUL WHETHER IT IS AT ALL MORE PRONOUNCED THAN THAT EXISTING BETWEEN THE FACTORY OWNER AND THE FACTORY OPERATIVE OF HIS OWN RACE AND WHATEVER THE OCCASION OR THE DEGREE OF SOCIAL DISTINC TION BETWEEN EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYE IN AGRICULTURAL COMMU NITIES THE DIRECTNESS AND FREQUENCY OF PERSONAL CONTACT AND THE EVIDENT MUTUALITY AND EQUALITY OF DEPENDENCE BETWEEN THEM CONTRIBUTE IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE TO RECIPROCAL GOOD WILL BUT CARRYING THE COMPARISON BETWEEN THE EMPLOYER AND 440PUBLIC REGULATION OF INDUSTRIES EMPLOYE CLASSES INTO COMMERCIAL INDUSTRIES AND SELECTING AT ONCE THAT SUBDIVISION OF COMMERCE WHERE THE NUMERICAL DISPARITY BETWEEN THOSE CLASSES IS MOST CONSPICUOUSTHAT OF RAILROAD TRANSPORTATIONA SITUATION OF THE UTMOST GRAVITY IS DISCLOSED OF THE RAILROADS OF THE UNITED STATES OTHER THAN MERE STREET RAILROADS A MILEAGE OF ABOUT 160000 MILES IS CONTROLLED AND OPERATED BY LESS THAN 600 INDEPENDENT COMPANIES WHO GIVE EMPLOYMENT TO THREEFOURTHS OF A MILLION OR MORE OF PERSONS THE EMPLOYES OF SOME OF THE PRINCIPAL RAILROAD SYSTEMS NUMBER HIGH INTO THE THOUSANDS ALL UNDER THE SAME CONTROL AND DIRECTION AND MOST OF THEM DEPENDENT UPON THE ACTION OF A SINGLE MAN OR AT MOST A LIMITED NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS FOR THEIR VERY DAILY BREAD THE MUTUALITY OF DEPENDENCE BETWEEN A GREAT RAILROAD CORPORATION AND ANY SINGLE ONE OF ITS HUNDREDS OF MACHINISTS ENGINEERS FIREMEN BRAKEMEN SWITCHMEN TRACKMEN OR OTHER EMPLOYES IS ABSOLUTELY INAPPRECIABLE THE DEPENDENCE IS ALTOGETHER ONESIDED THE SAME IS TRUE OF THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE PROPRIETORS OF LARGE MANUFACTURING ESTABLISHMENTS AND THEIR EMPLOYES THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF EMPLOYES TO EACH MANUFACTURING ESTABLISHMENT IN THE UNITED STATES IN 880 WAS NEARLY ELEVEN IT IS DOUBTLESS LARGER AT THE PRESENT TIME AS THE TENDENCY IS PLAINLY NOTICEABLE TOWARDS CONCENTRATION OF LABOR AND CAPITAL INTO LARGE ESTABLISHMENTS THIS AVERAGE NUMERICAL RELATION BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYES INMANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES IS VERY STRIKING WHEN COMPARED WITH THE SAME RELATION IN AGRICULTURAL OCCUPATIONS IN THE PRINCIPAL MANUFACTURING STATES OF NEW ENGLANDMASSACHUSETTS CONNECTICUT AND RHODE ISLANDTHE RATIO OF EMPLOYES TO ESTABLISHMENTS IS ABOUT 25 TO I IN SOME CITIES OF OTHER STATES IT IS NEARLY AS HIGH AND IN PITTSBURGH NOTABLY THE GREAT CENTRE OF IRON MANUFACTURE IT IS MORE THAN 33 TO I THESE FIGURES ARE SUFFICIENTLY SUGGESTIVE OF THE INEQUALITY OF DEPENDENCE BETWEEN THE EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYE CLASSES IN MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES BUT THEY REPRESENT AVERAGES MERELY IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT MANY SINGLE ESTABLISHMENTS 44I 910 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY BOTH IN MANUFACTURES AND MINING GIVE OCCUPATION TO THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYES EACH AND HERE THE DISPARITY BETWEEN THE CLASSES IS YET MORE AGGRAVATED AND CONSPICUOUS THE DISCONTENT OF A FEW UNORGANIZED FACTORY OPERATIVES OR MINERS OR THEIR REFUSAL TO ACCEPT A REDUCTION OF WAGES IS A MATTER OF SUPREME INDIFFERENCE TO THE EMPLOYER OF A THOUSAND MEN SO LONG AS THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM REMAIN FAITHFUL AND FRESH APPLICANTS FOR WORK ARE ALWAYS ON HAND BUT A FROWN OF DISPLEASURE FROM THE EMPLOYER MAY WELL STRIKE TERROR INTO ANY ONE OF THE THOUSAND TO WHOM DISMISSAL FROM SERVICE MEANS THE LOSS OF THE MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE FOR HIMSELF AND PERHAPS A DEPENDENT FAMILY IT APPEARS TO BE THE SENSE OF THIS DEPENDENCE AMONG THE LABORING CLASSES RATHER THAN THE URGENCY OF ACTUAL WANT OR ACTUAL EXERCISE OF OPPRESSIVE CONDUCT TOWARDS THEM THAT HAS GIVEN RISE TO LABOR ORGANIZATIONS FOR THE SOLICITUDE OF LARGE EMPLOYERS FOR THE WELFARE OF THEIR EMPLOYES AND THE PRAC TICAL MANNER IN WHICH IT IS MANIFESTED ARE MATTERS OF DAILY OBSERVATION IT CAN HARDLY BE DOUBTED THAT A VERY LARGE MAJORITY OF THE MEMBERS OF THESE ASSOCIATIONS RECEIVE IN THEIR REGULAR OCCUPATIONS WAGES WHICH ENABLE THEM TO LIVE IN A STATE OF COMFORT TO WHICH THE GREAT MASS OF AGRICULTURAL LABORERS AND MANY OF THE SMALL FARMERS OF THE COUNTRY ARE UTTER STRANGERS YET AGRICULTURAL LABORERS ARE RARELY CONNECTED WITH LABOR ORGANIZATIONS AND APPARENTLY FEEL BUT LITTLE INTER EST IN THEM THEIR COMPARATIVE INDEPENDENCE HOWEVER AND THE LIBERAL SHARE OF THE AVERAGE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT WHICH THEY RECEIVE SEEMS TO MORE THAN COMPENSATE FOR THEIR FAR GREATER DISCOMFORTS IN CONTROVERSIES BETWEEN LABOR AND CAPITAL PUBLIC SYM PATHY IN THE BEGINNING IS USUALLY ON THE SIDE OF THE FORMER BUT THE SENSE OF POWER ARISING FROM ORGANIZATION IS APT TO INSPIRE UNREASONABLE DEMANDS AND THE COERCIVE AND RETALI ATORY METHODS OF LABOR ORGANIZATIONSTHE STRIKE AND THE BOYCOTTAPART FROM THE MERITS OF THE CONTROVERSY IN WHICH THEY MAY BE EMPLOYED ARE FREQUENTLY GROSSLY TYRANNICAL IN 442PUBLIC REGULATION OF INDUSTRIES THEIR CHARACTER RESULT OFTEN IN SERIOUS PUBLIC INCONVENIENCE AND HAVE SELDOM ACCOMPLISHED THE OBJECT OF THEIR ORIGI NATORS SUCH ANTAGONISMS CAN NOT BUT BE FRAUGHT WITH THE MOST DANGEROUS TENDENCIES TO SOCIAL TRANQUILLITY AND SAFETY THE LOSS FROM THEM RESULTING TO BOTH SIDES AND OFTEN TO INNOCENT THIRD PARTIES IS USUALLY VERY GREAT DUE COOPERA TION BETWEEN THE RAILWAY COMPANIES AND THEIR EMPLOYES FOR EXAMPLE IS ESSENTIAL TO THE COMMERCIAL INTERESTS OF THE COUNTRY WHICH ARE DEPENDENT UPON RAILROAD TRANSPORTATION THE IDLENESS OF MULTITUDES OF LABORERS AND OF A VAST CAPITAL CONSEQUENT UPON AN EXTENSIVE STRIKE OF RAILROAD EMPLOYES IMPLIES AN ENORMOUS LOSS TO BOTH THE LABOR AND CAPITAL DIRECTLY INVOLVED BUT THE CONSEQUENT PARALYSIS OF THE FUNC TION OF TRANSPORTATION ENTAILS STILL FURTHER LOSS UPON A MULTI TUDE OF PERSONS WHO CAN IN NO WAY BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONTROVERSY AND WHO ARE ENTITLED TO PROTECTION AGAINST ITS INCIDENTAL RESULTS THESE BRIEF ILLUSTRATIONS SUFFICE TO SHOW THE SERIOUS AND GENERAL EVILS THAT MAY RESULT FROM GLARING CLASS DISTINCTIONS WITHIN THE SEVERAL INDUSTRIAL SEGMENTS OF SOCIETY OBSERVE NOW THE INEQUALITIES EXISTING BETWEEN MEMBERS OF DIFFERENT INDUSTRIAL SEGMENTS THE FARMER OCCUPIED WITH THE PRIMARY FUNCTIONS OF CIVILIZED SOCIETY CLAIMS FIRST ATTENTION HIS OF ALL THE INDUSTRIAL OCCUPATIONS IS THE ONE MOST NEARLY CAPABLE OF MAINTAINING EXISTENCE WITHOUT EXTRANEOUS AID YET AGRI CULTURE EVEN IN ITS WIDEST FORMS IS TO SOME EXTENT DEPENDENT ON OTHER OCCUPATIONS AND FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF ITS HIGHEST CAPACITIES AND GREATEST PRODUCTIVE POWERS ITS DEPENDENCE UPON OTHER OCCUPATIONS IS SIMPLY INCALCULABLE IMPROVED FARM MACHINERY IS AN ESSENTIAL FACTOR IN THE AGRICULTURAL PRO DUCT OF THE COUNTRY AND THE ADEQUATE DISTRIBUTION OF THE SURPLUS IS NO LESS IMPORTANT MANY IT IS TRUE ARE ENGAGED IN TILLAGE ON A SMALL SCALE WHO USE BUT FEW AND SIMPLE IM PLEMENTS YET THEIR PRODUCT IS USUALLY NO MORE THAN SUFFI CIENT FOR THEIR OWN INCOMPLETE AND STINTED SUBSISTENCE THOSE WHO ASPIRE TO A SHARE OF THE COMFORTS AND ENJOY MENTS WHICH MODEM PROGRESS HAS MADE POSSIBLE MUST DO 443 II12 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY SO AT THE COST OF A PROPORTIONATE PART OF THEIR NATURAL INDE PENDENCE BUT SEE HOW UNEQUAL ARE THE RELATIVE SITUATIONS OF THE AVER AGE FARMER ON THE ONE HAND AND ON THE OTHER OF THOSE IN COMMERCIAL AND MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES ON WHOM HE IS DE PENDENT RAILROAD FACILITIES FOR EXAMPLE ARE INDISPENSABLE IN THE TRANSPORTATION OF HIS SURPLUS PRODUCT USUALLY HE HAS NO CHOICE OF ROUTES OR OF MARKETS AND NOT THE SLIGHTEST VOICE IN FIXING THE PRICE HE MUST PAY FOR THE SERVICE HE IS BUT ONE OF MANY THOUSAND PATRONS OF THE CARRIER WHILE THE LATTER HAS PRACTICALLY COMPLETE CONTROL OF THE MEANS BY WHICH HE MAY MARKET HIS PRODUCE HIS INDIGNATION AND HIS PROTESTS AGAINST APPARENT INJUSTICE COUNT FOR NOTH ING HIS RUIN EVEN IS A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE SO LONG AS THE CARRIERS REVENUES ARE MAINTAINED FROM OTHER SOURCES MU TUALITY OF DEPENDENCE BETWEEN THE AVERAGE FARMER AND THE RAILROAD COMPANY IS INAPPRECIABLE FOR WHILE THE LATTER PER FORMS EXCLUSIVELY THE ESSENTIAL FUNCTION OF TRANSPORTATION THE FORMER IS BUT ONE OF MANY THOUSANDS WHO PERFORM THE RECIPROCAL FUNCTION OF SUPPLYING COMMODITIES FOR CARRIAGE ANOTHER OPERATION IS FREQUENTLY ESSENTIAL IN THE DISTRIBU TION OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS THAT IS THEIR AGGREGATION IN LARGE QUANTITIES AND REASSORTMENT ACCORDING TO QUALITY THIS REQUIRES FACILITIES ON A LARGE SCALE USUALLY OF AN EXCLUSIVE CHARACTER AND CONCENTRATED IN A VERY FEW HANDS THE GRAIN ELEVATORS OF CHICAGO AND OTHER LARGE CITIES FURNISH EXAMPLES NOTHING IS MORE NATURAL OR EASIER IN THE ABSENCE OF LEGAL RE STRICTIONS THAN FOR THE PROPRIETORS OF THESE ESTABLISHMENTS TO COMBINE AND PRESCRIBE PRICES AND REGULATIONS FOR THE STORAGE OF GRAIN REGARDLESS OF THE VIEWS OF THOSE TO WHOM THEIR SERVICE IS INDISPENSABLE THERE IS NO RECIPROCITY OF DEPEN DENCE BETWEEN THE PROPRIETOR ON ONE SIDE AND THE INDIVIDUAL PATRON ON THE OTHER THE MANUFACTURE OF THOSE IMPLEMENTS OF HUSBANDRY SO NECESSARY TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE BEST RESULTS IN AGRICUL TURE SUCH FOR EXAMPLE AS MOWERS REAPERS AND OTHER HAR VESTING MACHINES IS ALSO USUALLY CONFINED TO A FEW EXTENSIVE 444PUBLIC REGULATION OF INDUSTRIES ESTABLISHMENTS THIS IS PARTLY DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PATENTED INVENTIONS IN THE MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF WHICH THE PATENTEES HAVE A LEGAL MONOPOLY BUT THERE IS A MORE FUNDAMENTAL ECONOMIC REASON WHICH UNDERLIES THE TENDENCY TOWARDS CONCENTRATION AND MONOPOLY IN MANUFAC TURING INDUSTRIES THIS IS THE DIMINISHED COST OF PRODUCTION IN PROPORTION TO CAPITAL INVESTED WHEN THE OPERATION OF THIS PRINCIPLE HAS GRADUALLY CENTERED IN A FEW GREAT ESTAB LISHMENTS THE CONTROL OF ANY IMPORTANT BRANCH OF MANUFAC TURE OR COMMERCE THE FACILITY OF COMBINATION AMONG THEM AND THE DANGER OF INJURY LIKELY TO FOLLOW UPON INDEPENDENT AND COMPETITIVE ACTION ARE VERY APT TO RESULT IN A MUTUALLY PROTECTIVE ALLIANCE BETWEEN THEM MORE OR LESS COMPLETE AND EFFECTIVE SUCH ALLIANCES WHETHER OR NOT THEY NECESSARILY INVOLVE AS THE POPULAR BELIEF IS THE PRACTICE OF EXTORTION UPON A HELP LESS PUBLIC DO CERTAINLY CONSTITUTE IN THEMSELVES A REAL AND A SERIOUS SOCIAL DANGER BECAUSE THEY STRIKINGLY MANIFEST THE GREAT INEQUALITY OF DEPENDENCE BETWEEN THE FEW WHO ARE THUS COMBINED ON THE ONE SIDE AND THE UNORGANIZED MASSES OF THE COMMON PEOPLE ON THE OTHER THE FEELING OF DEPEND ENCE WHEN EVIDENTLY NOT RECIPROCATED IS A POWERFUL ELEMENT OF SOCIAL DISCONTENT THE ORGANIZATION OF THE FARMERS ALLIANCE IS LARGELY BASED ON THESE CONSIDERA TIONS BUT JEALOUSY OF THESE COMBINATIONS AND APPREHENSION OF DANGER FROM THEM IS BY NO MEANS CONFINED TO THE AGRICUL TURAL CLASSES WITNESS THE GENERAL INDIGNATION AROUSED BY THE DISCLOSURE OF THE SUGAR REFINERS TRUST A FEW YEARS AGO APPARENTLY THE SUGAR TRUST OPERATED TO ENHANCE THE PRICE OF THE PRODUCT CONTROLLED BY IT AND THUS AFFORDED A MORE TANGIBLE BASIS OF DENUNCIATION THAN SOMETIMES EXISTS IN THESE CASES FOR IN SOME CASES AT LEAST IT MUST BE CON FESSED THAT THE MONOPOLY OF SERVICES AND PRODUCTS HAS BEEN FOLLOWED BY A CONSTANT IMPROVEMENT IN QUALITY AND A STEADY LOWERING OF PRICES TO THE PUBLIC THIS HAS BEEN THE CASE WITH ILLUMINATING OIL IN THE HANDS OF THE STANDARD OIL CO 445 I314 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY WHOSE CONTROL OVER THAT AND KINDRED PRODUCTS IS NEARLY EXCLUSIVE AND WHICH IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS ONE OF THE MOST CONSPICUOUS EXAMPLES OF COMMERCIAL MONOPOLY THE PROGRESS OF THIS GIGANTIC ORGANIZATION TOWARDS ITS PRESENT POSITION OF SUPREMACY INVOLVED THE RUTHLESS SLAUGHTER OF ALL COMPETITORS THE VARIOUS INDEPENDENT REFINING ESTABLISH MENTS WHICH FINALLY SUCCUMBED TO THE STANDARD WERE HOW EVER COMPARATIVELY FEW IN NUMBER AND THOSE ENGAGED IN THE STRUGGLE FOR THEIR CONTINUED EXISTENCE LACKED THE NUMERICAL STRENGTH TO IMPRESS THEIR GRIEVANCES VERY FORCIBLY UPON THE PUBLIC MIND THE PRODUCTION OF  DRESSED MEATS  DEPENDS FOR SUCCESS UPON AN IMMENSE AND CONCENTRATED CAPITAL AND UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THE BUSINESS IS IN FACT CONDUCTED IT IS IN THE HANDS OF A VERY LIMITED NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS AND THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT WITH THE PROCESSES AND FACILITIES AT THEIR COM MAND THEY CAN SUPPLY FRESH MEAT TO CONSUMERS CHEAPER THAN IT CAN BE SUPPLIED UNDER THE USUAL METHODS OF PRODUC TION THEIR ESTABLISHMENTS ARE CONFINED TO A FEW CENTRAL POINTS ACCESSIBLE TO THE PRINCIPAL CATTLERAISING DISTRICTS AND ENJOYING AMPLE FACILITIES FOR THE SPEEDY AND SAFE TRANSPORTA TION OF THEIR PRODUCT TO THE MARKETS OF THE COUNTRY FAR AND NEAR THE MANIFEST TENDENCY OF THE SITUATION IS TOWARDS A MONOPOLY OF THE FUNCTION OF CONVERTING THE RAW MATERIAL INTO THE FINISHED FOOD PRODUCT THE ORIGINAL PRODUCERS AND THE ULTIMATE CONSUMERS CAN ONLY MEET THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF THIS EXCLUSIVE INTERMEDIARY CONTROLLING THE SOLE AVENUE OF ACCESS BETWEEN THEM THE SITUATION OF PRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS IS LIKE THE UPPER AND LOWER BULBS OF AN HOURGLASS AND THE DRESSED MEAT MONOPOLY REPRESENTS THE NARROW NECK THROUGH WHICH THE SAND MUST PASS IN ITS PROGRESS BETWEEN THE BULBS THE SLIGHTEST OBSTRUCTION IN THIS NARROW PASSAGE MEANS EXCESS ON ONE SIDE OF IT AND DEFICIENCY ON THE OTHER DROPPING THE SIMILE IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE DRESSED MEAT PRO DUCERS HAVE DANGEROUS POWERS ON THE ONE HAND TO DEPRESS THE PRICE OF THE LIVE CATTLE WHICH THEY BUY AND ON THE OTHER TO RAISE THE PRICE OF THE FINISHED FOOD PRODUCT WHICH THEY SELL 446PUBLIC REGULATION OF INDUSTRIES SUCH A STATE OF THINGS WHICH REDUCES VAST NUMBERS TO A CONDITION OF DEPENDENCE ON A VERY FEW CANNOT FAIL TO EXCITE APPREHENSION AND DISCONTENT POPULAR DENUNCIATION OF MONOPOLIES AND THE VAGUE BUT IRREPRESSIBLE DREAD WITH WHICH THE MASSES REGARD THE ENTERPRISES OF ASSOCIATED WEALTH ARE OFTEN MET AND SOUGHT TO BE ALLAYED BY THE ASSERTION WHICH STATISTICS FREQUENTLY SUSTAIN THAT EVERY STEP TOWARDS INDUSTRIAL CENTRALIZATION HAS RESULTED IN CHEAPENING TO THE PUBLIC THE PRODUCT OR THE SERVICE WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF THE MONOPOLY THAT THIS IS IN SOME CASES TRUE IS BEYOND QUESTION YET IT IS BUT HALF THE TRUTH THE OTHER HALF CONSISTS IN THE FACT THAT THE COST OF PRODUCTION TO THE PRODUCER AND THE COST OF SERVICE TO HIM WHO RENDERS IT ARE BY VIRTUE OF THE MONOPOLY ENJOYED BY THEM CHEAPENED IN FAR GREATER RATIO THAN ARE THE PRICES OF THE PRODUCTS OR THE SERVICES TO THOSE WHO PURCHASE OR EMPLOY THEM HENCE WHILE THE ACTUAL CONDI TION OF ALL CLASSES MAY BE IMPROVED THEIR RELATIVE CONDITION BECOMES FAR MORE UNEQUAL AND IT IS A FACT NEVER TO BE LOST SIGHT OF THAT THE CONCEPTION OF THE TERMS  GOOD  AND BAD AS APPLIED TO SOCIAL CONDITIONS IS ALWAYS RELATIVE NEVER ABSOLUTE IT MAY WELL ADMIT OF QUESTION WHETHER THE GROSS INEQUALITY OF DIFFERENT INDUSTRIAL CLASSES RESULTING FROM HIGHLY DIFFERENTIATED INDUSTRIAL CONDITIONS DOES NOT OFTEN OUTWEIGH AS A SOCIAL EVIL THE GENERAL BENEFITS CONFERRED BYRTHE EXISTENCE OF THOSE CONDITIONS COMPETITION MAY BE NO LESS ESSENTIAL AS A PRINCIPLE OF LIMITATION UPON PRIVATE FORTUNES THAN AS A SAFEGUARD AGAINST EXTORTION THE ACTUAL PRICES OF THE PRODUCT OF A MONOPO LIZED INDUSTRY MAY BE LESS THAN THOSE PREVAILING WHERE THE SAME INDUSTRY IS CARRIED ON UNDER COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS YET THESE CONDITIONS TEND STRONGLY TO PREVENT THE AMASSMENT IN A FEW HANDS OF VAST PROPORTIONS OF THE ENTIRE WEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AND THE CREATION OF GLARING AND DANGER OUS INEQUALITIES BETWEEN ITS COMPONENT MEMBERS THERE ARE HOWEVER CERTAIN FUNCTIONS OF THE HIGHEST PUB LIC CONSEQUENCE WHICH CAN BE SO MUCH BETTER PERFORMED 447 I5I6 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY UNDER EXCLUSIVE THAN UNDER COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS THAT THE LATTER IF THEY EVER PREVAIL AT ALL ARE SOON ELIMINATED AND MONOPOLY HOLDS FULL SWAY IN SOME INSTANCES THE GOVERN MENT HAS ITSELF ASSUMED OR BEEN INTRUSTED WITH THE DISCHARGE OF THIS CLASS OF FUNCTIONS AND PRIVATE PARTIES ARE STRICTLY EXCLUDED FROM PARTICIPATING IN THEM THE MAIL SERVICE OF THE COUNTRY IS IN POINT IF LEFT TO PRIVATE ENTERPRISE AND COMPETITION DOUBTLESS THE PRICE OF THE SERVICE WOULD BE MUCH LESS IN DENSELY POPULATED COMMERCIAL COMMUNITIES THAN EVEN IT IS NOW BUT IN SPARSELY SETTLED REGIONS THE PRICE WOULD BE PRACTICALLY PROHIBITORY OF COMMUNICATION BY MAIL UNDER GOVERNMENT MONOPOLY ALL SECTIONS ARE EQUALIZED THE PRINCIPLE OF THE SERVICE IS TO THIS EXTENT COMMUNISTIC BUT ITS GENERAL RESULTS ARE ADMIRABLE THE BUILDING OF HIGHWAYS FOR TRANSPORTATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN REGARDED AS A PUBLIC FUNCTION THOUGH IN THE MATTER OF RAILROAD BUILDING IN THE UNITED STATES THE FUNCTION IS USUALLY DELEGATED BY THE STATES TO CORPORATIONS IT IS HOWEVER A WELLKNOWN FACT THAT THE ORIGINAL CON CEPTION OF THE RAILROAD WAS BY ANALOGY TO THE TURNPIKE THAT OF A HIGHWAY OPEN FOR THE USE OF ALL CARRIERS UPON EQUAL TERMS THAT EVERY RAILROAD COMPANY HAS NOW BECOME PRAC TICALLY THE EXCLUSIVE CARRIER OVER ITS OWN LINE IS DUE PERHAPS MORE TO ECONOMIC THAN TO PHYSICAL CAUSES THE BULK OF THE TRAFFIC IS UNQUESTIONABLY CARRIED CHEAPER UNDER EXCLUSIVE THAN IT WOULD BE UNDER COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS OF COURSE WHERE PRIVATE MONOPOLY OF ANY INDUSTRIAL FUNCTION PREVAILS ITS OBJECT WILL BE TO EXTRACT FROM THE PUBLIC THE LARGEST POSSIBLE NET GAINS FOR ITS PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THIS DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE PRICES ARE CHARGED HIGH PRICES VERY OFTEN DEFEAT THEIR OBJECT AND DIMINISH PROFITS BY DRIVING OFF PATRONAGE STILL THE COST TO THE PUBLIC IS APT TO BE MORE THAN IS NECESSARY TO SECURE TO THE OWNERS OF THE MONOPOLY A REASONABLE NET RETURN UPON CAPITAL INVESTED UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THERE IS A GROWING DISPOSITION IN THE PUBLIC TO ASSUME TO ITSELF BY DELEGATION TO GOVERNMENT SOME FUNCTIONS WHICH FOR THEIR 448PUBLIC REGULATION OF INDUSTRIES PROPER DISCHARGE MUST NECESSARILY BE OF AN EXCLUSIVE NATURE THIS DISPOSITION IS MOST OFTEN MANIFESTED IN MUNICIPAL OWNERSHIP OF WATER WORKS AND GAS OR ELECTRIC PLANTS FOR THE SUPPLY OF THE CITY WITH WATER AND LIGHT THE SUCCESS OF GOVERNMENTAL DISCHARGE OF A FEW INDUSTRIAL FUNCTIONS HAS SUG GESTED TO MANY THE STILL FURTHER EXTENSION OF THE GOVERNMENTS SPHERE OF INDUSTRIAL ACTION A LARGE AND INCREASING NUMBER OF CONSERVATIVE PERSONS WHO WOULD INDIGNANTLY RESENT THE IMPUTATION TO THEMSELVES OF A SPIRIT OF SOCIALISM ARE CON VINCED OF THE NECESSITYNOT OF ABSOLUTE PUBLIC CONTROL PERHAPSBUT OF STRINGENT PUBLIC REGULATION OF MANY INDUS TRIES AND IT IS IN THIS DIRECTION THAT THE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM OF INDUSTRIAL MONOPOLY SEEMS LIKELY TO BE ATTEMPTED THE LIMITS OF THIS ARTICLE FORBID ANY EXPLANATION OF THE METHODS OF PUBLIC REGULATION OF INDUSTRIES OR ANY REFERENCE TO THE ATTEMPTS TOWARD PUBLIC INTERVENTION BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYES WHICH HAVE BEEN OR ARE LIKELY TO BE MADE IN CONCLUSION IT MAY BE SAID THAT THE FURTHER EXTENSION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION OF PRIVATE BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES WHERE PRACTICALLY UNLIMITED MANHOOD SUFFRAGE PREVAILS WILL IN ALL PROBABILITY BE ATTENDED WITH SERIOUS DANGERS AND EVILS BUT THAT IT WILL BE RESORTED TO AS AN ATTEMPTED REMEDY FOR THE EXISTING EVILS OF PRIVATE MONOP OLY IS HARDLY TO BE DOUBTED W D DABNEY WASHINGTON D C 449 I7

IN CIVIL CASES EDITORIAL NOTETHE SUBJOINED CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN MR A LEO WEIL 769 OF PITTSBURG PA AND THE SOLICITOR GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES SEEMS WELL WORTH PRESERVING IN PERMANENT FORM THE QUESTION AT ISSUE IS WHETHER IT IS THE DUTY AND POLICY OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PROSECUTE CONTEMPT PROCEEDINGS FOR A WILLFUL BREACH OF THE INJUNCTION OF A FEDERAL EQUITY COURT IN A CIVIL CASE BETWEEN PRIVATE PERSONS WHERE THE PLAINTIFF IS NO LONGER INTERESTED IN THE ENFORCEMENT OF OBEDIENCE OF THE INJUNCTION BY REASON OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT ITS PLANT HAS BEEN SHUT DOWN AND ITS OPERATION ABANDONED BECAUSE OF THE FAILURE OF THE DEFENDANTS TO OBEY THE INJUNCTION ORDER THE OPERATIONS OF THE PLAINTIFF CORPORATION WERE ON AN EXTENSIVE SCALE AND THERE WERE A LARGE NUMBER OF DEFENDANTS STRIKERSCIRCUMSTANCES WHICH TENDED TO GIVE WIDE PUBLICITY TO THE CASE AND TO THE CONTEMPT ON THE PART OF THE DEFENDANTS THESE CIRCUMSTANCES AS MR WEIL ARGUES MAKE IT ESPE CIALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD INTERVENE IN ORDER TO VINDI CATE THE DIGNITY OF THE COURTS PITTSBURGH PA FEBRUARY 2 1914 TO THE COUNCIL OF THE AMERICAN JUTICATURE SOCIETY ANLD TO THE MEMBERS OF THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION GENTLEMEN IS IT THE DUTY OF GOVERNMENT TO MAINTAIN RE SPECT FOR ITS LAWS BY INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS TO PUNISH FOR CON TEMPT THOSE WHO HAVE REFUSED TO OBEY THE DECREES OF ITS COURTS WHERE SUCH DECREES WERE MADE TO PREVENT LAWLESSNESS AND PRE SERVE ORDER I SUBMIT FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THE FOLLOWING LETTERS EX CHANGED BY ME WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AT WASHINGTON A FORMAL APPLICATION WITH TRANSCRIPT OF PROCEEDINGS AND EVI DENCE HAVING BEEN FILED WHICH WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS ANSWERED THIS QUESTION IN THE NEGATIVE THIS COMMUNICATION IS AN APPEAL FROM THAT DECISION TO THE BENCH AND BAR OF THIS COUNTRY IN MY OPINION THIS ATTITUDE OF THE GOVERNMENT MUST BE CHANGED IF CONTEMPT FOR OUR COURTS AND THE ADMINISTRATION OF 520DUTY OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PROSECUTE 521 JUSTICE IS NOT TO BE FURTHER INCREASED FROM ITS ALREADY ALARMING PROPORTIONS TO AN EXTENT WHICH WILL ENCOURAGE RIOT DISORDER AND ANARCHY FRATERNALLY A LEO WIL HON JOHN W DAVIS SOLICITOR GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES WASHINGTON D C SIR THE ATTACHED BRIEF OF AUTHORITIES WHICH I AGREED TO SEND WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE NOT ONLY THAT THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HAS THE RIGHT TO PROCEED IN ITS OWN NAME AGAINST PARTIES GUILTY OF CONTEMPT IN DISOBEYING THE ORDERS AND DECREES OF ITS COURTS BUT THAT SUCH PROCEDURE IN THE NAME OF THE UNITED STATES BY ITS OWN LAW OFFICERS IS THE BETTER PRACTICE THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HAVE BEEN CALLED TO YOUR ATTENTION IN THE APPLICATION FILED I WOULD SUGGEST PRESENT A CASE WHICH PE CULIARLY CALLS FOR INTERVENTION BY THE GOVERNMENT ON ITS OWN AC COUNT AND IN ITS OWN NAME AND BY ITS OWN LAW OFFICERS FIRST WE HAVE A FINDING BY THE JUDGE OF A FEDERAL COURT CON VICTING DEFENDANTS OF WILLFUL AND CONTEMPTUOUS DISOBEDIENCE OF THE INJUNCTION AWARDED BY THE COURT AND THAT TOO OF A PUBLIC NATURE INVOLVING THE PEACE AND ORDER OF A WHOLE COMMUNITY AND LEADING TO RIOT AND BLOODSHED SECOND WE HAVE PARTIES WHO WERE DIRECTLY INTERESTED IN PROCURING THE INJUNCTION AND IN ENFORCING OBEDIENCE THERETO NO LONGER INTERESTED BECAUSE THEIR PLANT HAS BEEN SHUT DOWN AND ITS OPERATION ABANDONED ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR FAILURE TO OBTAIN THE PROTECTION OF THE LAW IN THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS SO FAR NEG LECTED THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE DECREES OF ITS COURTS THIRD WE HAVE A CASE IN WHICH A FAILURE TO PUNISH IF PER SISTED IN BECAUSE OF THE PUBLIC CHARACTER OF THE OFFENCE AND THE KNOWLEDGE THEREOF BY SO LARGE A NUMBER WILL BRING INTO DIS REPUTE AND DISRESPECT IF NOT CONTEMPT THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE BY THE FEDERAL COURTS FOURTH IF RESPECT FOR LAW WHICH IS THE LINE OF DEMARCATION BETWEEN CIVILIZATION AND BARBARISM IS TO OBTAIN IN THIS COUNTRY THOSE ENTRUSTED WITH ITS ADMINISTRATION HAVE THE DUTY IMPOSED TO SO ACT THAT A WILLFUL DISOBEDIENCE OF THE ORDERS OF COURT LEADVIRGINIA LAW REVIEW ING TO RIOT AND OUTRAGE THE CESSATION OF INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY RE SULTING IN GREAT FINANCIAL HARDSHIP TO A COMMUNITY THE LOSS IN WAGES OF NEARLY A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH TO EMPLOY EES ANXIOUS TO WORK SHALL NOT BE SUPINELY TOLERATED BY A VIRILE GOVERNMENT THE FACT THAT THE PUNISHMENT FOR THE CONTEMPT IF THE GOVERNMENT NOW PROCEEDS WILL RESULT IN NO ADVANTAGE TO THE PRIVATE LITIGANT WHO OBTAINED THE INJUNCTION IS A GREATER REASON WHY THE GOVERNMENT DISREGARDING SUCH PRIVATE INTER ESTS SHOULD GIVE NOTICE THAT IT WILL PROTECT ITS COURTS FROM ANY CONTEMPTUOUS DISREGARD OF THEIR ORDERS AND THEIR DECREES WHETHER THE PRIVATE INTERESTS WISH IT OR NOT FIFTH IF THE GOVERNMENT UPON ITS OWN MOTION AND IN ITS OWN NAME WILL INSTITUTE THESE PROCEEDINGS TO PUNISH FOR CONTEMPT AND WILL PROSECUTE THE SAME IT WILL THEREBY TEACH LARGE NUMBERS WHO ARE AT THIS TIME PRONE TO CONSIDER ALL LAW AS IMPOTENT THAT IN THIS COUNTRY NO MAN WITH IMPUNITY SHALL TAKE UPON HIMSELF THE RESPONSIBILITY OF DISREGARDING THE SOLEMN DECREES AND FORMAL OR DERS OF COURTS OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION AND THE EFFECT WILL BE THE GREATER THE LESSON THE BETTER THE RESTRAINING INFLUENCES AGAINST COMMISSION OF LIKE OFFENCES THE STRONGER BECAUSE WHILE THE PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL HAS NO LONGER AN INTEREST NEVERTHELESS THE GOVERNMENT STILL HAS AND ALWAYS WILL HAVE THE INTEREST AND THE PURPOSE TO UPHOLD THE DIGNITY OF ITS COURTS AND THE SANCTITY OF ITS LAW I KNOW OF NO GREATER GOOD THIS ADMINISTRATION CAN DO HOW EVER MUCH THE GREAT EXPECTATIONS OF ITS FRIENDS MAY BE REALIZED THAN TO RESTORE THAT RESPECT FOR LAW AND ORDER WHICH UNFORTU NATELY HAS BEEN TO A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT UNDERMINED AND WITH OUT WHICH NO GOVERNMENT IS SECURE AND NO RIGHTS OF PROPERTY AND PERSON ARE SAFE RESPECTIVELY SUBMITTED A LTO WZIL WASHINGTON D C NOVEMBER 25 1913 MR A LEO WEIL PITTSBURGH PA SIR THE REQUEST SUBMITTED BY YOURSELF AND OTHERS THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD UNDERTAKE THE PROSECUTION OF PERSONS CHARGED 522DUTY OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PROSECUTE 523 TO BE GUILTY OF CONTEMPT IN THE ABOVE STYLED CAUSE HAS BEEN CAREFULLY CONSIDERED FROM THE PAPERS YOU SUBMIT IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE VIOLATION OF THE COURTS ORDER WAS SUCH AS TO WELL DESERVE THE PUNISHMENT WHICH IT WOULD HAVE RECEIVED BUT FOR THE RULING OF THE COURT ON THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE MOVING PAPERS BUT SINCE THE PROCEED INGS WERE DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THEIR REINSTITUTION BY THE PLAINTIFF COMPANY OR BY THE UNITED STATES OR THE COURT ITSELF IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT THE INTERVENTION OF THE GOVERN MENT IS NECESSARY TO PREVENT A FAILURE OF JUSTICE YOUR REQUEST THEREFORE MUST BE CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THE GENERAL POLICY INVOLVED WHICH RAISES QUESTIONS MUCH BROADER THAN THE INDIVIDUAL CASE UNQUESTIONABLY IF THE COURSE YOU SUGGEST IS PURSUED SIMILAR REQUESTS WILL BE PREFERRED FROM TIME TO TIME BASED UPON THE PRECEDENT SO ESTABLISHED WITH THE ULTIMATE RESULT THAT THE CON DUCT OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS BY THE GOVERNMENT THROUGH ITS PROSE CUTING OFFICERS WILL BECOME THE RULE RATHER THAN THE EXCEPTION AS JUDGE SATER REMARKS IN THE COURSE OF HIS OPINION IN THE PRESENT CASE MY ATTENTION HAS NOT BEEN DIRECTED TO ANY CONTEMPT PRO CEEDING ARISING OUT OF AN ORDER MADE IN THE MAIN CAUSE OF A PURELY CIVIL CHARACTER IN WHICH THE GOVERNMENTS COUNSEL HAS APPEARED TO PROSECUTE EVEN THOUGH THE PROSECUTION WAS FOR DISTINCTIVELY CRIMINAL CONTEMPT IF INSTANCES CAN BE CITED TO THE CONTRARY IT CERTAINLY HAS NOT BEEN THE GENERAL PRACTICE AND IT DOES NOT SEEM TO ME DESIRABLE THAT IT SHOULD BECOME SO OF COURSE IT IS A MATTER OF THE HIGHEST PUBLIC MOMENT THAT THE COURTS SHOULD BE RESPECTED AND THAT THOSE WHO DISOBEY THEIR ORDERS SHOULD BE PROMPTLY AND EFFECTIVELY PUNISHED BUT IS IT NOT BETTER THAT RELIANCE SHOULD BE PLACED IN THE FUTURE AS IN THE PAST UPON THE READINESS OF PARTIES IN INTEREST TO BRING TO THE ATTEN TION OF THE COURT ANY ACTS OF DISOBEDIENCE AND THE WILLINGNESS OF THE JUDGES

EFFECTIVELY AS THE PRESENT PRACTICE THESE CONSIDERATIONS WHICH AS I REPEAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MERITS OF THE INSTANT CASE COMPEL ME TO REFUSE TO IN STRUCT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY AS YOU REQUEST I AM AUTHORIZED TO SAY THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL CONCURS IN THE VIEWS HEREIN EXPRESSED MAY I ASK YOU TO BE GOOD ENOUGH TO ADVISE YOUR ASSOCIATE COUNSEL AND OTHERS IN INTEREST OF THE DEPARTMENTS ATTITUDE IN THE MATTER VERY RESPECTFULLY JNO W DAVIS SOLICITOR GENERAL PITTSBURGH PA DZCEMBER 11 1913 HON JOHN W DAVIS SOLICITOR GENERAL WASHINGTON D C SIR I ACKNOWLEDGE RECEIPT OF YOUR LETTER IN WHICH YOU STATE THE REQUEST SUBMITTED BY YOURSELF AND OTHERS THAT THE GOV ERNMENT SHOULD UNDERTAKE THE PROSECUTION OF PERSONS CHARGED TO BE GUILTY OF CONTEMPT IN THE ABOVE STYLED CAUSE HAS BEEN CAREFULLY CONSIDERED I NOTE THAT YOU REFUSE TO INSTRUCT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY AS I REQUEST I NOTE THAT THE REASON YOU GIVE FOR THIS REFUSAL IS NOT THE WANT OF POWER BUT IT CERTAINLY HAS NOT BEEN THE GENERAL PRACTICE AND IT DOES NOT SEEM TO ME DESIRABLE THAT IT SHOULD BE COME SO I NOTE YOUR STATEMENT FROM THE PAPERS YOU SUBMIT IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE VIOLA TION OF THE COURTS ORDER WAS SUCH AS TO WELL DESERVE THE PUNISHMENT WHICH IT WOULD HAVE RECEIVED BUT FOR THE RUL ING OF THE COURT ON THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE MOVING PAPERS BUT SINCE THE PROCEEDINGS WERE DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJU DICE TO THEIR REINSTITUTION BY THE PLAINTIFF COMPANY OR BY THE UNITED STATES OR THE COURT ITSELF IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT THE INTERVENTION OF THE GOVERNMENT IS NECESSARY TO PRE VENT A FAILURE OF JUSTICE 524DUTY OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PROSECUTE 525 I NOTE YOUR OBSERVATION OF COURSE IT IS A MATTER OF THE HIGHEST PUBLIC MOMENT THAT THE COURTS SHOULD BE RESPECTED AND THAT THOSE WHO DISOBEY THEIR ORDERS SHOULD BE PROMPTLY AND EFFECTIVELY PUNISHED BUT IS IT NOT BETTER THAT RELIANCE SHOULD BE PLACED IN THE FU TURE AS IN THE PAST UPON THE READINESS OF PARTIES IN INTEREST TO BRING TO THE ATTENTION OF THE COURT ANY ACTS OF DISOBEDI ENCE AND THE WILLINGNESS OF THE JUDGES TO DO THEIR DUTY BY ENFORCING THE ORDERS WHICH THEY ENTER THE INCONVENI ENCESTO USE NO STRONGER WORDWHICH WOULD RESULT IF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WERE TO ASSUME THE BURDEN OF INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS IN CONTEMPT IN EVERY LITIGATION BE TWEEN PRIVATE PARTIES WHERE THE ORDER OF THE COURT HAD BEEN DISOBEYED ARE OBVIOUS NOR WOULD IT IN MY JUDGMENT AID THE COURSE OF JUSTICE AS EFFECTIVELY AS THE PRESENT PRACTICE YOU SEEM TO IGNORE THE FACTS OF THE CASE PRESENTED TO YOU AS ALSO THE CHANGES TAKING PLACE IN THE PUBLIC SENTIMENT OF OUR TIMES AN INDUSTRIAL PLANT EMPLOYING NINE HUNDRED MEN HAS BEEN SHUT DOWN THE EMPLOYEES ARE OUT OF WORK THE MILL IS IDLE THIS HAS TRANSPIRED BECAUSE THE DECREE OF THE UNITED STATES COURT WAS VIOLATED A DECREE WHICH ENJOINED INTERFERENCE BY FORCE WITH THE EMPLOYEES OF SUCH PLANT AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT WILLFUL AND DELIBERATE VIOLATION WAS PROVEN THOSE FOUND GUILTY WERE NOT PUNISHED THE PARTIES IN INTEREST THE OWNERS OF THE MILL HAVING BECOME DISCOURAGED WITH THEIR FUTILE ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN FROM THE COURTS PROTECTION FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES HAVE ABANDONED ALL PRESENT INTENTION OF RESUMING OPERATIONS THERE IS NOW NO PARTY IN INTEREST EXCEPT THE PUBLIC THE QUESTION IS SHALL THE GOVERNMENT THE ORDERS OF WHOSE COURTS HAVE BEEN THUS IGNORED STAND CALMLY BY ACQUIESCING BECAUSE AS I UNDER STAND YOUR OPINION IT WOULD BE INCONVENIENT TO ACT AND BETTER TO PERMIT THE USUAL PRACTICE TO PREVAIL AND TO RELY UPON THE IN TEREST OF PARTIES TO THE CAUSE TO VINDICATE THE SUPREMACY OF THE LAW I SUBMIT THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT JUSTIFY ITS REFUSAL TO ACT UPON THE GENERAL PRACTICE GENERAL PRACTICE IS AN INFLEXI BLE RELIANCE ONLY SO LONG AS IT KEEPS STEP WITH THE WORLDS PROG RESS GENERAL PRACTICE CRUCIFIED JESUS AT JERUSALEM AND BURNED THE WITCHES AT SALEM SLAVISH ADHERENCE TO GENERAL 3VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW PRACTICE WOULD HAVE LEFT US STILL NAKED IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN RESPECT FOR LAW AND THE COURTS HAS BEEN TO SOME EXTENT UNDER MINED AND IF RESPECT IS NOT STILL DIMINISHING IT CERTAINLY IS NOT INCREASING AT THIS TIME LARGE NUMBERS BECAUSE OF A WANT OF CONFIDENCE ARE DEMANDING THE RIGHT TO DIRECTLY PARTICIPATE IN GOV ERNMENT TO INITIATE LEGISLATION TO RECALL JUDGES AND EVEN TO RE CALL JUDICIAL DECISIONS AS TO YOUR SUGGESTION OF INCONVENIENCE PUBLIC SENTIMENT NO LONGER REGARDS THE CONVENIENCE OF PUBLIC OFFICIALS AS PARAMOUNT TO PUBLIC INTERESTS MOREOVER THE AUTHORITIES HOLD THAT THESE PROCEEDINGS TO PUN ISH FOR CONTEMPT ARE IN THEIR NATURE CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS AND THEREFORE LIKE ALL PROCEEDINGS TO PUNISH FOR CRIME SHOULD BE CONDUCTED BY THE GOVERNMENT SUCH PROCEEDINGS ARE IN THE NAME OF THE UNITED STATESTHE GOVERNMENT EVEN IF GOV ERNMENT SOMETIMES PERMIITS PRIVATE PARTIES TO ACT HAS GOVERN MENT THE RIGHT TO DEMAND OF PRIVATE PARTIES THAT THEY UNDERTAKE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE GOVERNMENTS MOST SACRED DUTYTHLE EN FORCENIENT OF RESPECT FOR THE ORDERS OF ITS COURTS IN MY OPIN ION IT IS EXTREMELY DOUBTFUL IF IN ANY CASE THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO MORE THAN ALLOW THE INTERESTED PARTY TO ASSIST I BE LIEVE THAT THE LAW OFFICERS OF THE GOVERNMENT IN THE PUBLIC IN TEREST SHOULD INSIST THAT THE GOVERNMENT ALONE HAS THE RIGHT IN A CASE OF THIS KIND TO PROCEED OR TO DISCONTINUE TO PUNISH OR TO GRANT MERCY IF SIR AS YOU SAY IT IS A MATTER OF THE HIGHEST PUBLIC MO MENT THAT THE COURTS SHOULD BE RESPECTED AND THAT THOSE WHO DIS OBEY THEIR ORDERS SHOULD BE PROMPTLY AND EFFECTIVELY PUNISHED AND IF FOR ANY REASON THOSE WHO HAVE DISOBEYED THE ORDERS OF THE COURTS HAVE NOT BEEN PROMPTLY AND EFFECTIVELY PUNISHED WHETHER IT BE THE INERTIA OF THE PARTIES IN INTEREST THE FACT THAT SUCH PARTIES HAVE LOST THEIR INTEREST THE MISFORTUNE OF A MNISLIRECTED JUDICIAL ASTUTENESS FINDING UPON ITS OWN MOTION PINPRICKS IN THE PLEADINGS OR OTHER CAUSE THEN SIR THAT HIGH EST PUBLIC MOMENT IS NOT IN MY JUDGMENT SUBSERVED BY THE GOVERNMENT SUPINELY SUBMITTING BECAUSE THE

FORTH TO RIGHT ITS FIGHT IF THE PRIVATE INTEREST BECAUSE OF THAT INTEREST OR FROM A SENSE OF PUBLIC DUTY DID ASSUME THE GOVERNMENTS OBLIGATION OF EN FORCING RESPECT FOR THE COURTS BY MOVING FOR THE PUNISHMENT OF THOSE WHO HAVE WILLFULLY DISOBEYED THEIR ORDERS AND FAILED THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT THEREBY RELIEVED IT IS ONE OF THE MOST IM PERATIVE DUTIES OF THE GOVERNMENT A DUTY NOT TO BE DELEGATED OR ESCAPED TO PROTECT ITS COURTS AS MUCH IN THE INVIOLABILITY OF THEIR ORDERS AS IN THE PERSONS OF THEIR JUDGES IT NEEDS NO AR GUMENT IN THIS GENERATION TO PROVE THAT ALL CIVILIZATION IS BUILT UPON RESPECT FOR LAW THAT THIS RESPECT FOR LAW IS IN FACT THE LINE OF DEMARCATION BETWEEN CIVILIZATION AND BARBARISM BUT THAT THIS RESPECT FOR LAW CANNOT OBTAIN IF THE ORDERS OF THE COURTS ARE WILLFULLY DISOBEYED YOU SAY UNQUESTIONABLY IF THE COURSE YOU SUGGEST IS PURSUED SIMILAR REQUESTS WILL BE PREFERRED FROM TIME TO TIME BASED UPON THE PRECEDENT SO ESTABLISHED WITH THE ULTIMATE RESULT THAT THE CONDUCT OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS BY THE GOVERNMENT THROUGH ITS PROSECUTING OFFICERS WILL BECOME THE RULE RATHER THAN THE EXCEPTION I SAY AMEN A CONSUMMATION DEVOUTLY TO BE WISHED WHAT MORE LOFTY FUNCTION HAS GOVERNMENT TO PERFORM THAN THE PRESERVATION OF ORDER BY THE ENFORCEMENT OF LAW IF FOR ARGUMENT IT BE CONCEDED AND I CONCEDE IT ONLY FOR ARGUMENT THAT IN THE FIRST INSTANCE IT WERE BETTER FOR THE PARTY IN INTEREST TO INITIATE THE PROCEEDINGS TO PUNISH FOR CONTEMPT IT HAS BEEN SHOWN IN THE PRESENT CASE THAT SUCH PARTY IN INTEREST DID SO PROCEED BUT FAILED NOT BECAUSE THE CONTEMPT WAS NOT COMMITTED AND PROVEN BUT BECAUSE THE COURT ON ITS OWN MO TION FOUND SOME IRREGULARITY IN THE MOVING PAPERS IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT THE PARTY IN INTEREST BEING NO LONGER INTERESTED CON CLUDED IT HAD PERFORMED ITS FULL DUTY AND DID NOTHING FURTHER UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES IS THE GOVERNMENT IN THE OPINION OF THOUGHTFUL CITIZENS JUSTIFIED IN REFUSING TO DO ITS DUTY I RE PEAT THAT NO MORE SACRED OBLIGATION RESTS UPON GOVERNMENT THANVIRGINIA LAW REVIEWR TO PRESERVE THE LAW AND ORDER OF A COMMUNITY THAT LAW AND ORDER CANNOT BE PRESERVED WHEN THE SOLEMN DECREES OF THE COURTS IN THE NAME AND BY

INDIVIDUAL RESPECT THE LAW WHEN THE DE PARTMENT OF JUSTICE REFUSES TO ENFORCE THE LAW CAN A MAN WHO IS OF UNDERSTANDING FAIL TO RECOGNIZE THAT BOTH LAW AND GOVERNMENT ARE DESERVING OF CONTEMPT IN A

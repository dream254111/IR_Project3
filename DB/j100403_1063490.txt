FOR A LIEN AGAINST THE PROPERTY OF THE BANK IRUPT TO BE ANNULLED AUTOMATICALLY BY  67F OF THE BANKRUPTCY ACT OF 1898 THE LIEN MUST HAVE A BEEN OBTAINED THROUGH LEGAL PRO CEEDINGS B AGAINST AN INSOLVENT PERSON C WITHIN FOUR MONTHS PRIOR TO THE FILING OF A PETITION IN BANKRUPTCY AGAINST HIM AND D FOLLOWED BY ADJUDICATIONL IF THESE REQUISITES OBTAIN AND THE LIEN IS ON PROPERTY TITLE TO WHICH WHEN RELIEVED OF THE LIEN WILL VEST IN THE TRUSTEE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE CREDITORS SUCH LIEN BY THE TERMS OF THE SECTION IS ANNULLED2 THE QUESTION WHICH HAS PRODUCED CONFLICTING VIEWS IS WHETHER OR NOT ALL THE ABOVE REQUISITES BEING PRESENT A LIEN ON PROPERTY EXEMPT GENERALLY BY STATE STATUTE AND SAVED TO THE BANKRUPT BY  6 OF THE BANKRUPTCY ACT BUT FOR SOME 64 BANKR ACT  67F  BANKR ACT  67FEDITORIAL NOTES REASON NOT EXEMPT AS TO THIS LIEN IS ANNULLED AS AGAINST CREDITORS AND IN FAVOR OF THE BANKRUPT BY  67F ALTHOUGH THE DISCHARGE IN BANKRUPTCY DISCHARGES THE BANKRUPT OF PERSONAL LIABILITY ON THE DEBT WHICH IS THE FOUNDATION OF THE LIEN THERE IS MUCH AUTHORITY FOR THE VIEW THAT EVEN THOUGH THE FOREGOING REQUISITES ARE PRESENT  67F DOES NOT ANNUL SUCH LIEN ON EXEMPT PROPERTY BUT THAT AFTER THE DISCHARGE THE LIEN MAY STILL BE ENFORCED AGAINST THE PROPERTY3 THE REASONING OF THESE AUTHORITIES IS THAT THE BANKRUPTCY ACT WAS ENACTED FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE TRUSTEE AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF ALL CREDITORS AND NOT FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE BANKRUPT WHEN THE LIEN ON EXEMPT PROPERTY IS ANNULLED THERE IS NO BENEFIT TO CREDITORS SINCE THE PROPERTY SO RELIEVED OF LIENS IS PRESERVED BY  6 TO THE BENEFIT OF THE BANKRUPT CONSEQUENTLY AS THERE IS NO DIMINUTION OF THE ESTATE OF THE BANKRUPT WHICH THE TRUSTEE HOLDS FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL CREDITORS SUCH A LIEN IS NOT ANNULLED4 IN SUPPORT OF THIS ARGUMENT IT IS ASSERTED THAT THE SWEEPING STATE MENT OF  67F THAT ALL LIENS OBTAINED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES STATED SHALL BE DEEMED NULL AND VOID IS MODIFIED BY THE LATER CLAUSE OF  67F TO THE EFFECT THAT THE PROPERTY AFFECTED BY THE LIEN SHALL BE RELEASED FROM THE SAME AND PASS TO THE TRUSTEE AS A PART OF THE ESTATE OF THE BANKRUPT TOGETHER WITH THE CLAUSE IN  70 WHICH DECLARES THE TRUSTEE OF THE ESTATE OF THE BANKRUPT SHALL BE VESTED BY OPERATION OF LAW WITH THE TITLE OF THE BANKRUPT EXCEPT IN SO FAR AS IT IS TO PROPERTY WHICH IS EXEMPT    THESE AUTHORITIES CONSTRUE THE CLAUSE PASS TO THE TRUSTEE AS A PART OF THE ESTATE OF THE BANKRUPT TO MEAN THE PASSING OF TITLE TO THE TRUSTEE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE CREDITORS AND SINCE UNDER  70 TITLE TO EXEMPT PROPERTY CAN NEVER PASS TO THE TRUSTEE AND SINCE UNDER THIS CONSTRUCTION EXEMPT PROPERTY IS THE ONLY PROPERTY WHICH IS RELIEVED OF LIENS UNDER  67F THE LIEN ON SUCH PROPERTY REMAINS UNAFFECTED5 THIS LINE OF AUTHORITIES ALSO AFFIRMS THAT THE BANK RUPTCY COURT HAS NO JURISDICTION OVER THE EXEMPT PROPERTY AND HENCE CAN EXERCISE NONE OVER THE SPECIFIC LIEN6 8 MCKENNEY V CHENEY 118 GA 387 45 S E 433

SOMETIMES THOUGHT TO UPHOLD THIS CONTENTION BUT HERE THE COURT MERELY DECIDED THAT WHERE A PERSON HELD A CLAIM AGAINST THE BANKRUPT CONTAINING A WAIVER OF EXEMPTIONS WHICH 65VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW ON THE OTHER HAND THERE IS EQUALLY STRONG AUTHORITY FOR THE VIEW THAT  67F ANNULS ALL LIENS OBTAINED WHILE THE ABOVE FOUR REQUI SITES ARE PRESENT AND HENCE IT IS IMMATERIAL WHETHER THE PROPERTY TO WHICH SUCH A LIEN ATTACHES IS EXEMPT OR NOT7 THIS WOULD SEEM TO BE THE CORRECT VIEW AS IT PROCEEDS UPON THE THEORY THAT THE GENERAL PURPOSE OF THE ACT OF 1898 WAS NOT ONLY TO SECURE A BENEFIT TO THE CREDITORS BUT ALSO TO GIVE A BENEFIT TO THE DEBTOR BY DISCHARGING HIM FROM HIS LIABILITIES AND ENABLING HIM TO START AFRESH WITH THE PROPERTY SET APART TO HIM AS EXEMPT8 THESE AUTHORITIES TAKE THE VIEW THAT THE CLAUSE PASS TO THE TRUSTEE AS A PART OF THE ESTATE OF THE BANKRUPT DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE TITLE TO SUCH PROPERTY MUST PASS TO THE TRUSTEE BUT THAT THE PROPERTY SHALL COME INTO THE MERE POSSESSION OF THE TRUSTEE FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE BANKRUPTCY STATUTE9 EXEMPT PROPERTY COMES INTO THE HANDS OF THE TRUSTEE TO ENABLE HIM TO VALUE AND SET OFF TO THE BANKRUPT HIS EXEMPTION10 THIS IS SUFFICIENT TO GIVE THE BANKRUPTCY COURT JURISDICTION OVER THE PROPERTY AND AS LIENS MIGHT INTERFERE WITH THE TRUSTEES DUTIES IN THIS RESPECT ALL LIENS OBTAINED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES STATED ARE ANNULLED FOR ALL PURPOSESL ACCORDING TO THIS VIEW  70 HAS NOTH ING TO DO WITH THE QUESTION WHETHER A LIEN ON EXEMPT PROPERTY IS ANNULLED OR NOT SINCE NO TITLE TO THE EXEMPT PROPERTY NEED PASS TO THE TRUSTEE IN ORDER TO BRING IT WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF  67F12 THIS LATER VIEW WAS SUSTAINED BY THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES IN THE RECENT CASE OF CHICAGO ETC RY CO V HALL13 CONTRACT OF CORPORATION WITH ITS OWN DIRECTORAS TO THE VALIDITY OF A CONTRACT BETWEEN A PRIVATE CORPORATION AND ONE OF ITS DIRECTORS THERE APPEARS TO BE MUCH DIFFERENCE OF OPINION THREE DISTINCT VIEWS HAVE BEEN ADVANCED I ACCORDING TO ONE VIEW THE DIRECTORS BY THE MERE FACT OF BEING DIRECTORS ARE NOT DISQUALIFIED FROM ENTERING INTO CONTRACTS WITH THE CORPORATION PROVIDED THERE ARE ENOUGH DIRECTORS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CONTRACT REPRESENTING THE CORPORATION TO MAKE A QUORUM AND FURTHER PROVIDED THAT THE CONTRACT IS FAIR OPEN AND HONEST CLAIM HAD NOT BEEN REDUCED TO AN IN REM RIGHT THE BANKRUPTCY COURT HAD NO JURISDICTION TO ALLOW THE WAIVER AND DISTRIBUTE THE ASSETS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE CREDITORS BUT THE COURT DID NOT DECIDE THAT THE BANK RUPTCY COURT HAD NO JURISDICTION OVER SUCH PROPERTY

to the accompanying table for a general view of the timerelations of simple reactions we may pass at once to the topic of greatest interest viz the influences by which they are quickened or retarded These may be considered as A objective or affecting the conditions of the experiment and B subjective affecting the attitude of the reactor A 1 The Nature of the Impression The distinctive necessitating a precise accommodation a condition not always supplied in the above experiments This view is strengthened by the shortening in the reaction time by 366 for Exner by 240 for v Wittich when the eye is stimu lated electrically In reacting to a temperature sensation care must be taken not to react to the sensation of contact with the skin Where this has been done it has been found that the reaction to the sensations of temperature is longer than to contact and that the reaction to heat is longer than to cold Thus Vintschgau and Steinach react to a pressure on various points of the head in 109 a to a sensation of cold Table of Simple Reaction Times No Nature of Senseimpression Nature of Reac Observer Time Remarks I Visual various kinds Finger Average of many 185 II Tactile

the impression The motor signal ling process is the same the connection between the im pression and movement is about equally artificial in all cases so that the chief variability must be in the time needed for receiving the impression For the different senses this time is different Taking the general average of all the observations accessible to me I find for hearing 1386 for touch 148o for sight 1850a This order is quite con stant with the different observers the long time of visual reactions being referable to the long inertia period of that sense as well as to the small perceptive area of the retina in 135o of heat in 146 0 similar values for various points of the hand being 1210a 1880 2090 The researches of Gold scheider agree with these in the main but make the differ ence between the re action times to heat and to cold much greater The senses of taste and smell clearly illustrate the effect of the kind of stimulation for here the relative inac cessibility of the sense organs and the slowly acting chemi cal processes involved lead to a long reaction time Though experimentation is difficult and uncertain in these senses we may cite for smell the results of Moldenhauer on the odors of various oils centring about 3006 oil of roses 2736 cam phor 321a musk 3190 ether 2556 etc and for taste of Honigschmied who reacts to various tastes on the tip of theIX4 SCIENCE tongue in 1826 though other subjects require about 300o On the back of the tongue the time is much longer and it varies for different tastes being longest for bitter shortest for salt and about equal for sweet and sour Within the same sense the reaction time will vary according to tihe na ture and place of the stimulus The above cited differences for tastes and smells show this and for different visual im pressions for different tones for contact at different parts of the body different results have been obtained referable to slight variations in sensibility length of nerve traversed clearness of the impression and the like These minor dif ferences are not easily establishcd but the following may be cited Exner reacts to an electric shock on the hand in 1320 on the forehead in 13706 on the foot in 1750 v Wit tich reacts to a point on the back of the finger in a longer time than to one on the front 1446 and 15667 and regards the difference as due to a difference of sensibility Hall and Kries clearly show that the reaction to a point looked at in indirect vision is longer than to one in direct vision 195o and 2350 and find further differences according as the point is above or below inside or outside the retinal centre A high tone is reacted to more quickly than a low one and so on It is easier to demonstrate the influence of 2 the inten sity of the stimulus Within limits intense stimuli affect senseorgans more quickly than weak ones and roughly speaking an increase in the intensity of the stimulus is con comitant with a decrease in the reaction time According to Wundt the noise of a hammer falling respectively from heights of 1 4 8 and 16 millimetres was reacted to in 2176 14676 1327 and 1356 and the sound of a ball falling from heights of 2 5 25 and 55 centimetres in 17667 16107 1590 and 940 respectively Exner varied the length and there fore the brilliancy of an electric spark from 05 to 7 milli metres and obtained a steadily decreasing reaction time of 1586 to 12306 More complete are the observations of Ber ger and Cattell who found that as the light increased from 7 to 23 to 123 to 315 to 1000 anbd to two greater but not determinable degrees of intensity as compared with a small unit of light the reaction times fell average of two ob servers from 21007 to 1840 to 17460 to 17005 to 1690 to 1560 to 14860 For sound as the ball fell from heights of 60 160 300 and 560 millimetres the reaction times were 151071466 1270 and 1230 For electrical touch excitations reactions to four grades of stimuli separated by equally perceptible differences were made average of two observers in 17306 1590 14506 and 1456 Wundt regards the differ ence in reaction times of the different senses as in part referable to differences in intensity and when reacting to just perceptible intensities of sensation in various senses finds about the same long time for each 3300 3 The Mode of Reaction The various movements by which we may signal that a sensation has been received may differ in the ease of their execution in the length of nerve traversed as well as in the naturalness of association with the impression Such differences however seem to be small when once the movement is understood and antici pated the difference in the times of its execution is slight Thus IMvfinsterberg found in testing the reaction of each of the five fingers that while at first the thumb and little finger reacted more slowly than the others after some practice the VOL XVI No 395 times of all were substantially the same Fere however has some results suggesting that the fingers making the strongest movements react in the shortest times Very in teresting too is the experiment of Ewald in which the stimulus an electric shock is given to the finger in the very key by which the reaction is signalled the reaction consist ing in the very natural movement of drawing the finger away Under these circumstances he found a brief and constant time of 906 Both Vintschgau and Cattell have compared the time of reacting by closing a key with the finger and by speaking a word and find the vocal method the longer by about 160 and 3060 respectively Differences in reacting from the two sides of the body have been ob served by some the right side showing the shorter reaction but this difference can hardly be considered as constant Orchansky has shown in one case that the movements of inhibition take about the same time as those of excitation of a muscle and it would be possible to study the relative ease of various movements by this method A practical example is furnished by the commands of military drill the words carry present etc announcing the mode of reaction for the performance of which the following word  arms is the signal B We pass next to the more important subjective fac tors referring in the main to the expectation and the atten tion While nothing has been definitely said upon this point the implication has been that the subject tries his ut most to react as quickly as possible and that he knows the nature of the experiment While the influences now to be discussed seem to be general in their effect making the nervous system at one time a better and again a worse re acting apparatus they may in certain respects be subjected to a more definite analysis We begin with 1 the subjects foreknowledge of what is to take place We may antici pate the outcome of experimentation on this point by for mulating the law that the more definite the foreknowledge of the subject the quicker the reaction Apparently there is a process that must be gone through with in each re action and the better prepared the subject is for thisthat is the more of this process gone through with before the giving of the stimulus the less of it falls within the measured inter val The precise nature of this process is a difficult and much discussed problem It may be sufficient to note at present that the re action to a certain stimulus cannot but imply in some sense the distinction of that stimulus from the many others by which we are constantly surrounded If the subject be reacting to a visual impression he will prob ably not press the key should a noise occur in the room or something accidentally come in contact with his hand To react to a visual impression thus implies the distinction of that from other impressions It implies the identification of the expected with the existing impression Just as we recognize an appearance in the heavens or under the micro scope more readily when we know where and what to look for or as we immediately recognize an almost forgotten ac quaintance when expecting him though at a chance meeting we might have passed him without recognition so we react to an impression most quickly when it is most definitely ex pected with regard to its nature its time and place of ap pearance and the like This expectation may be more or less specific and an interesting series of experiments consistSCIENCE in varying the foreknowledge of the subject while still leav ing it definite enough to call the result a simple reaction a We may leave the precise time of the appearance of the stimulus undetermined This may be done by experiment ing with and without a preparatory signal preceding the stimulus by a regular interval Wundt reacted to the sound of a ball falling from a height of 25 centimetres in 76cr with a preparatory signal but in 253c7 if no such signal preceded to a ball falling five centimetres in 175cr in the first case and 266cr in the second The time between the signal and stimu lus is here regular and the most favorable time seems to be about two seconds Lange found the time with an interval of two seconds less than with one of one or three seconds If the interval be irregularly varied within two seconds the effect is hardly noticeable but if irregularly varied within fifteen seconds the time is increased Cattell With a normal reac tion to sight of 149cr and to sound of 124cr the reaction to sight with the interval varying within two seconds was 148c6 when varying within fifteen seconds to sight 174cr to sound 165cr average of two observers b If the time and nature of the stimulus be known but its intensity be varied the time is increased When reacting to a uniform change between a feeble and a loud sound the reaction time to the former was 127cr to the latter 116cr but when these changes were made in an irregular and unexpected manner the times were lengthened to 208cr and 198c Similarly the attention may be prevented from being ef fectually directed to the making of the reaction by a variety of circumstances Some of these we may group under the term 2 distraction By a constant noise or other means we may be creating a stimulus to which the attention is in voluntarily drawn and thus withdrawn from the process of reaction Wundt reacted to a sound of mean intensity in 189c6 to a strong sound in 158cr but when a disturbing sound was going on in the room these reactions required 313cr and 203cr On the other hand with Cattell when in good practice so that the reaction became almost automatic the effect of a disturbing sound both upon sight and sound reactions was insignificantnormral for sight 149cr with disturbing noise 155r normal for sound 124a with dis turbing noise 124cr It is quite probable that what acts as a disturbance to one person hardly affects another In some in dividuals the reaction time seems to be extremely sensitive to any mental disturbance One of Obersteiners subjects with an average reaction time of about 100c6 requires 142c6 to re act when music is heard and anothers reaction time is lengthened by 100cr when talking is going on in the room A more general and thorough form of distraction may be effected by imposinJg a task requiring distinct mental effort at the same time that the reaction is to take place Thus Cattell attempted to add 17 consecutively to a series of num bers and found that reactions taken while this was going on were longer by 28cr average of two observers All such effects seem to be much more marked when the re action in question is new than when it has become familiar and partly automatic The disturbance seems to act by delaying the association between stimulus and movement 3 Wet have now to notice a distinction which though but recently brought to light by N Lange 1888 is of fun damental importance A reaction may be made in two ways In the one form of reaction the attention is directed I5 to the expected impression it is identified as the expected impression and thereupon is initiated the impulse resulting in the reacting movement The several processes are per formed serially the attention being concentrated upon the sensory part of the process In the other form of reaction the attention is directed to the movement the impulse is ready and is set off by the appearance of the signal almost automatically the identification of the actual with the ex pected impression being omitted The first is spoken of as the complete or sensory  mode of reaction the second as the  shortened  or motor  form In the experiments of Lange the simple sensor reaction time to a sound aver age of three persons was 227cr motor 123cr to a visual im pression average of two persons sensory 290cr motor 113cr to a tactile impression one person sensory 213c motor 108cr These differences howeer seemn to be extreme Muibsterberg finds for sound sensory 162cr motor 120cr A further characteristic of the motor form of reaction is that its average variation is smaller ie the process is more regular and that false reactions occur either anticipations of stimulus or reactions to some accidental disturbance The distinction becomes still more important when the re action is not simple but complex and we will return to it later The distinction is important as aiding in the expla nation of individual differences as well as of the path of practice The somewhat conflicting results obtained before this distinction was taken into account might very well be due to the fact that the one observer reacted in the one way and the other in the other Thus the reaction times of Kries and Auerbach are motor for they are brief false re actions occur and it is noted that the simple reactions fol lowing reactions involving distinctions were longer by 41cr and 31cl than beforea change probably due to a return to a partially sensory mode of reaction Again there are doubtless transitional modes between the two and there are reasons for believing that the path of practice is from the sensory to the motor form of reaction The influences that remain to be discussed may be consid ered under the heads of practice  fatigue  individual differences and abnormal variations 4 Practice As just noticed the effect of practice is intimately connected with the mode of reaction It is noticed by almost all writers but the extent to which it influences the time is very various The observations make it probable that the effect of practice is most marked at first and that when once the initial stages are over the effect of continued practice is small It is greatest in those persons whose time is longest at first and seems most influential in acts that are complicated and lie somewhat beyond the realm of daily experience When the action is once thoroughly learned an interval of disuse seems not to affect the time seriously After not reacting for three months Cattell found no essential differ ence in the time On the other hand with some there is a slight newness on beginning each days work making the first reactions of a series rather long Trautscholdt 5 A similar statement may be made of fatigue it has greatest effect upon the complicated less thoroughly learned processes and varies with the individual and the mode of reaction With an automatic simple process its effect is very slow to appear Cattell It may enter at any stage of the process sensory motor or central but the last seems to AUGUST 29 1890II6 SCIENCE be the most serious It appears as a difficulty in keeping ones attention upon the experiment and thus lengthens the time and especially the average variation of the experi ments By fatigue is meant the fatigue brought about by the experimenting itself The time is also affected by gen eral fatigue preceding the experiment Some individuals are extremely sensitive to influences of this kind 6 Individual Variations The fact here to be investi gated is the general one that different persons require differ ent times for the performance of the same operations The difficulty of drilling a company of men to act in concert whether in military drill or otherwise springs in part from this difference It was from this point of view too that the time of mental processes was first studied So long ago as 1795 Maskelyne the astronomer royal discharged his as sistant because the latter recorded the transit of a star across the wire of the telescope half a second or more later than he himself Some twentyfive years later Bessel another as tronomer had his attention called to the point and upon in vestigation established the fact that no two observers re corded such transits at precisely the same time The differ ence in time between any two observers was usually expressed as an equation and hence the term personal equation which though strictly applicable only to the differences so found has assumed a much widep eaning The6individual differences become greater as the proee to be performed increases in complexity and this explain in part why the personal equations as determined by the com plicated eye and ear method were s large with the simpler method of electrical record these differences are much reduced Besides the differences due to practice and the mode of re action there are a large namber of minor sources of varia tion which as yet are not sufficiently understood to justify a correlation of quick or slow reaction times with definite individual qualities We may however note a that the time is longer in children than in adults as has been shown amongst others by Binet who found that children from 3 to 7 years reacted in from 4405 to 66 o when adults required but 1405 In the very old the time is longer than in the primne of life TUnder the influence of mental or physical fatigue worry or slight indisposition the time has been in creased Obersteiner Vintschgau Goldscheider and others have incidentally observed these effects showing an increase of 305 to 40O These variations are related to others shad ing over into the abnormal Under this head may be con sidered 7 the action of drugs and reaction times in the insane Several of the earlier experimenters made a few observations concerning the effect of drugs Exner found quite a marked lengthening of the time after drinking wine Vintschgau and Dietl found that the effect of coffee was to decrease and of morphium to increase the time for a consid erable period The more elaborate researches of Kraepelin show that the effect of amyl ether and chloroform is a sudden lengthening of the reaction times reaching a maxi mum in a very few minutes and followed by a rather long period of times slightly shorter than the normal If a strong dose of the drug be used the lengthening is more considera ble and the secondary shortening slighter Thus Kraepelin whose normal reaction was 1836 after a strong inhalation of ether reacted in 2986 and in the period of shortening in 1705 while with a light narcosis the maximum reaction tVoL XVI No 394 was 2230 and the sl i ned reaction 150o The effect of alcohol howeveh X a brief period of shortened times fol lowed by a long period of lengthened times This is also found by Ornansky who with a normal reaction of 155q6 reacts i 1055o eight minutes after taking a dose of alcohol and in 2255 after thirty minutes The observations of War ren do not yield equally positive results but do not conflict with those of Kraepelin Changes in the extent of the aver age variation have also been observed On what psycho logical factors these differences depend it is difficult to say but the subjective feelings accompanying the lengthened times are a difficulty in keeping the attention upon the mat ter in hand and an unwillingness to exert ones self The evidence afforded by the action of drugs upon these pro cesses is important as indicating the dependence of the reactions upon physiological conditions A change of re action times in insanity has been frequently observed but the field for individual variation is here very large It seems probable that in most forms of mental disease and particularly in melancholia there is a considerable length ening of the reaction time amounting in extreme cases to onehalf or threequarters of a second In the excited forms of disease such as mania a shortening has been observed Obersteiner cites a case of general paralysis in the incipient stages of which the time was 1666 in a more advanced stage 2816 in a most advanced stage 4515 Stanley Hall has found a marked shortening of the time in the hypnotic condition but his result is not corroborated by oqthersn Methods of Experimentation The chief requisite in these experiments is an apparatus for accurately measuring small intervals of time The ear liest method still in use records the vibrations of a tuning fork upon the quicklymoving smoked surface of a rotating drum and beneath this the moment of giving tbhe signal and making the response If a fork making one hundred vibra tions per second be used whole hundredths can be directly counted and smaller fractions estimated Wundt has con structed a more accurate and specialized instrument in which a fork making five hundred vibrations per second is used A very much simplified form of apparatus has been devised by Obersteiner in which the slide holding the record is moved by hand and the movement of reaction draws the fork off the record and by Bowditch in which the fork it self carries the record and the signal and reaction are indi cated by a shifting of the writing point In the astronomical records clockwork takes the place of a tuningfork The objection to these methods is that they necessitate tedious counting of curves If the rate of the rotatingapparatus is very uniform and frequently tested one may substitute measuring for counting but the most convenient apparatus for the purpose is the Hipp chronoscope This instrument contains a fine clockwork set in motion by releasing a spring and running for about half a minute The hands of the two dials the one indicating tenths and the other thou sandths of a second do not move until drawn away from a set of cogs by the opening or closure of a magnetic circuit and are stopped again in the same way By making the usual arrangement whereby the production of the stimulus sets the hands in motion and the reacting movement brings them to a standstill we can read off directly the interval of the reaction time Unless we can afford to sacrifice accu racy for convenience a means of controlling the chrono scope is indispensable This may be done by timing the fall of a ball from a given height and comparing it with theo retical time In the apparatus for this purpose supplied with the chronoscope the ball is mechanically released and the mode of making the circuit is equally defective so thatAUGUST 29 1890 SCIE the error of the control apparatus is probably greater than that of the chronoscope To obviate this difficulty I make use of a ball held in position by a magnet and falling from any height up to seven feet upon the arm of a wellbalanced lever thus securing an instantaneous release By setting the magnet and ball at different distances we are also enabled to decide whether the error is absolute or relative It is here Inecessary to break the current by which the ball falls and to make the current by which the chronoscope starts at the same moment this is effected by a key specially devised for the purpose The chronoscope possesses a regulation for alternating its rate when too slow or too fast but I find it most convenient to make sparing use of this and apply a correction for each days determinations as found with the fall apparatus Another form of control makes use of a falling hammer the record being also made with a tuning fork A recent device of Ewald combines the two methods by mechanically counting the vibrations of a tuningfork a delicate armature is drawn to and released by a magnet with each vibration of the fork moving the hand of a dial over one of its divisions as it does so The fork is vibrating con stantly but the making of the signal sends the current into the 4 interruptioncounter while the reacting movement again diverts the current away from it It will record at the rate of one hundred per second Galton has constructed for ordinary uses a machine in which the signal is given by the release of a rod or pendulum and the reacting move ment mechanically arrests the fall or swing a scale of in terval being determined for the apparatus empirically San ford has devised a simple but not expeditious chronoscope an which the signal and the response separately set in mo tion two pendulums of slightly different periods the react ing interval being calculated from the number of oscillations occurring before the two are again in unison The methods of indicating the moment at which the signal appeared and the moment at which the reacting movement was made are simple When the record is writ ten on a rotating surface a point connected with a magnet and writing a straight line beneath the vibrations of the fork writes that line at a different level when the signal is given and returns to the same level when the reacting movement is made or the tuningfork itself may be made to write at a different level during the interval measured The arrangement by which the level is changed on the rec ord or the hands are set in motion in the chronoscope at the same instant that the stimulus appears is equally sim ple For sound the noise of the key by which the circuit is made is generally sufficient or other sound may be pro duced by bodies falling upon various surfaces and thereby opening or closing a key For sight the impression to which a reaction is to be made may be concealed behind a screen and the drawing away of this screen at the same time makes or breaks an electric circuit Frequently the reactor sits in the dark and the impression becomes visible only when an electric spark appears or the spark itself may be the stimulus For touch temperature and taste a typi cal device is that of Vintschgau in which the end of a rod touches the sensitive surface and the pressure so exerted makes a contact with a delicate metallic blade inserted in the same apparatus For smell the movement by which the odor is set free is similarly utilized The reacting movement is usually that of pressing an ordinary telegraphic key Devices have been constructed by which movements of the foot of the jaw of the voice and lip may be similarly noted For more detailed descriptions consult the references under this head at the end JOSEPH JASTROW To be continued IN the Atlantic for September Mr Justin Winsor considers the

education of the deaf called to their aid Dr E M Gal laudet the distinguished president of the National College at Washington and later Professor A Graham Bell whose long interest in the deaf qualified him more than any other pub lic man in America outside those directly engaged in the work of instruction to speak with some degree of authority on the questions presented to him The information pre sonted by Professor Bell has been published in pamphlet form entitled  Facts and Opinions and contains a great variety of facts concerning visible speech heredity day schools articulation and kindred subjects The Royal Com mission has recently completed its investigations and re ported to Parliament the results of its work I mention the report right here to draw attention to another of those sin gular conclusions which have characterized the opinions of men of unquestioned learning and intelligence when under taking to speak officially concerning the deaf In paragraph 398 of this report we find this extraordinary statement  The want of exercise of the lungs and throat on the part of pupils taught by the manual method is apt to produce chilblains Two members of the Commission had the good sense to dissent from this paragraph and officially to pro nounce it quite absurd It is impossible within the limits of this article to discuss seriatim the several subjects upon which Professor Bell has addressed the public and I am therefore compelled to make a selection from those studies with which his name has be come most closely associated and from these it will be easily possible to infer the value of what he has done for the deaf It is also necessary to add that in the friendly contention for methods aroused by Professor Bells long indictment of our American schools there is on our part a ready recogni tion of the honesty and zeal which has inspired him and if we speak plainly on the studies which he has given to the public we ask for ourselves a recognition of the same sin cerity something of that same chevalier spirit with which he has carried his lance against us The first measure for the education of the deaf with which Professor Bell became identified was visible speech This is a system of universal alphabetics originated by A Melville Bell and was introduced into the United States nearly twenty years ago The first exposition of this system of vocal physiology in the city of Boston created quite a sensa tion in literary circles The extraordinary statement during the first few months of trial that adult deafmutes had acquired all the sounds of the English language in ten les sons Report Massachusetts Board of Education 18711872 drew at once the attention of all those interested in the deaf to this new device From the report already referred to and from that of the succeeding year we find that  the effects produced by this new system are in the highest de gree remarkableeven miraculous and again Perfect and pleasing articulation is certain To this last claim it is enough to say that to day there is not a reputable teacher in the United States who makes any approximation to so rash a claim In view of all that was claimed for visible speech it is not surprising that it soon became among us a

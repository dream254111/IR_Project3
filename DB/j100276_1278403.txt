testatrix regarding the use of the term children in her will On appeal this was assigned as error and the court held that the evidence should not have been admitted The court there says what he has written determines the testators intent and where the language is clear and precise and the person or thing exists and is accurately named extrinsic circumstances surrounding the testator cannot detach the language used from its primary significance Extrinsic circumstances may explain the language of the will they cannot contradict vary or control it See also Williams v Williams 182 Ky 738 Lamb v Jordan 233 Mass 335 In re Spencers Estate I8I Cal 514 held that inter pretive testimony was inadmissible to show that the word personal in a residuary bequest to personal legatees named in the will was not used to differentiate people from corporations named but to distinguish personal friends from relatives The court there said there is no ambiguity in the language and therefore no reason for interpretive testimony We know of no use of the word personal either technical or colloquial which would justify its employment in distinguishing those not related from those who are The same situation existed in the principal case The word heirs can admit of only one legal interpretation as far as this case is concerned and to admit extrinsic evidence to show that something different was meant would be to allow the oral declarations of the testator to be substituted for the written will WILLSVALID IN PART AND VOID IN PARTEFECT OF VOID CLAUSES UPON PROBATED WILLAfter providing that no property was to be sold for a period of fifty years after the probate of his will at which time the prop erty was to be sold and the proceeds distributed in accordance with its pro visions the testator devised all of his property to his daughter forever but if she died without issue then to the nephews and nieces of his own blood The daughter died without issue The nephews and nieces claimed under the will and it was contended that the clause suspending alienation being void the whole will was void Held as the devise to the nephews and nieces was not dependent in any way upon the void clause and as the prop erty would go to those to whom the testator intended it should go the void clause might be struck out and the valid part allowed to stand Quilliam v Union Trust Co Ind I92I 131 N E 428 The general rule seems to be that where there are valid and invalid clauses in the same will the good will be allowed to stand unless the valid and invalid clauses are so closely connected as to constitute one entire scheme for the disposition of the estate so that the presumed wishes of the testator would be defeated if one portion were retained and the other portion rejected The big question therefore is when are clauses so closely connected that by retaining a part and rejecting the others the intention of the testator is thereby defeated The distinction lies in the scheme or lack of a scheme employed by the testator in disposing of his property If the testator devises directly to the beneficiaries and a future interest created by the same instrument is void the prior interests become what they would 252RECENT IMPORTANT DECISIONS have been had the limitation of the future estates been omitted from the instrument GRAY RULE AGAINST PERPTUITIXS par 247 248 and cases there cited Where however the testator does not devise directly to bene ficiaries but creates a trust and seeks to dispose of his property by that means the valid and invalid clauses are not independent but are links in one entire scheme created to carry out a common purpose To execute only a part would be to make a new will for the testator and therefore the whole trust must stand or fall together Barrett v Barrett 225 Ill 332 Reid v Voorhees 216 Ill 236 In the latter case the argument was advanced that if the interest covered by the valid clauses would not be changed by excluding the invalid clauses the good should be allowed to stand The court said this was in disregard of the cardinal principle of wills for by the trust the testator had created one entire scheme for the disposal of all his property and to hold that his scheme must fail in so far as he sought to dispose of the corpus of his estate but might be sustained as to the life estates would be to make a will which the testator never intended In the above cases the void clauses disposed of the corpus of the estate Where the testator devised his property in trust and the void clauses disposed of life interests or were limitations over after a fee and the corpus of the estate was covered by the valid clauses the good were allowed to stand Herron v Stanton Ind 1920 128 N E 363 In re Thaw 1917 169 N Y Supp 430 In Tyler v Fidelity Trust Co I58 Ky 280 a trust was created for the disposal of the property and the clause disposing of the corpus of the estate was void The court allowed the valid clauses to stand and held that the modern rule per mits the estate to progress under the will up to the point where the rule against perpetuities begins to operate In that case however the beneficiaries under the will were the same persons who would have taken under the statute of descent and distribution The result of the cases seems to be that in cases of trusts if the primary purpose of the testator is accomplished by probating the valid portions they will be allowed to stand provided no mani fest injustice would result to the beneficiaries by such a construction Such an injustice results when the beneficiaries under the valid clauses would not only take under the will but would also share in the property covered by the invalid clauses if it were declared intestate Benedict v Webb 98 N Y 460 Reid v Voorhees supra In Beatty v Stanley I11 I92I I3I N E 687 the testator made bequests of personalty and then devised all his realty in trust The trust was void and the court held that the bequests must also fall In that case the beneficiaries of the bequests would share in the intes tate property but as the beneficiaries of the invalid clauses would not it is difficult to see how any injustice would result WORKMENS COMPENSATIONACCIDENTAI INJURYINJURY CAUSED BY EXCITEMENTThe plaintiff while performing his duties as foreman in the defendants coal yard became engaged in a

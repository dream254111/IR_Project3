j100128,Columbia Law Review,1109941,Larceny and the Perkins Case,i246261,LARCENY AND THE PERKINS CASE It is not the object of this paper to present an extended dis cussion of the doctrine established for the State of New York by the final decision in People ex rel Perkins v Mossl Its chief pur pose is to summarize the facts of the case to recite briefly the his tory of its progress through the courts and to comment upon the conflicting views contained in the Court of Appeals opinions The facts are neither complicated nor numerous During the fall of I904 Mr McCall the president of the New York Life Insurance Company promised Mr Bliss the treasurer of the Republican National Committee that the company would con tribute up to the sum of 50000 for use in the Presidential cam paign then in progress The relator Mr Perkins advanced from his own resources to Mr Bliss 48500 these advances were made at the request of Mr McCall who promised relator that he should be reimbursed later The reason for relators advancing the money instead of having the contribution made directly from the funds of the company was stated at the time by Mr McCall to be that it would make it easier for him to refuse demands which were being made for other political contributions In December 1904 the relator was reimbursed pursuant to the directions of President McCall after the matter had been dis cussed in a meeting of the Finance Committee of which Mr Perkins was chairman and Mr McCall a member No formal vote was taken in the committee about the matter nor was any entry made of the transaction in the minutes of the committee The reimbursing check was made payable to J P Morgan  Co of which banking house Mr Perkins was a member neither the face of the check nor any of the entries upon the Insurance Companys books indicated that the check was given to redeem Mr McCalls promise to contribute up to 50000 to the Repub lican National Committee Upon depositions by officers of the company stating the fore going facts and a letter from the relator to District Attorney Jerome declaring that the relator believed the foregoing expendi ture to be for the benefit of the company and that he derived no personal advantage of any kind from the transaction and had no 1 907 I87 N Y 410 80 N E 383COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW intent other than to serve the interests of the company Magis trate Moss issued a warrant of arrest for Mr Perkins charging him with the crime of grand larceny in the first degree Imme diately upon his arrest writs of habeas corpus and certiorari were issued in his behalf and the relator was brought before a Special Term of the Supreme Court After a hearing this tribunal dis missed the writ of habeas corpus and remanded the relator into custody Upon his appeal the Appellate Division in the first Department reversed the order of the Special Term and dis charged the relator The People then appealed to the Court of Appeals where by a vote of four to three the decision of the Appellate Division was affirmed It appears to have been the purpose of the District Attorney by the rather unusual procedure employed in this case to secure an authoritative judicial determination of the question whether such a diversion of an insurance companys funds as has been described above amounts to larceny under the New York Penal Code If it did not then it would be a waste of public money and an unwarranted stirring up of scandal to secure indictments against sundry persons and bring them to trial for conduct which was not criminally punishable The single question then in this case was did the affidavits which were presented to the magistrate and which set forth the facts narrated above furnish any legal evidence of the commission of the crime of larceny by Mr Perkins That crime is defined in section 528 of the Penal Code which reads so far as material as follows A person who with the intent to deprive or defraud the true owner of his property or of the use and benefit thereof or to appropriate the same to the use of the taker or of any other person    having in his possession custody or control as a bailee servant attorney agent clerk trustee or officer of any person association or corporation    any money property evidence of debt or contract article of value of any nature or thing in action or possession appropriates the same to his own use or that of any other person other than the true owner or person entitled to the benefit thereof steals such property and is guilty of larceny The learned judge who heard the case at Special Term decided that the facts presented to Magistrate Moss made out a Gray J in I87 N Y at p 418 80 N E at p 385 says If the information which was laid before the magistrate furnished no legal evidence of the commission of a crime by the relator then he was illegally restrained of his liberty 388LARCENY AND THE PERKINS CASE 389 prima jacie case of larceny as that crime is defined above He held that Mr Perkins exercised a control of the funds alleged to have been misappropriated within the contemplation of the statute and that the appropriation of the funds by the concerted action of him and Mr McCall to the use of the treasurer of a national campaign committee under the circumstances disclosed in the affidavits presented to the magistrate was larceny under the Code if it was done with a criminal intent Such intent he thought was disclosed by the fact that the contribution in ques tion was not only ultra vires but inherently wrong Said the learned judge1 To permit an artificial creature of the State unless it be a corpora tion expressly authorized by law to engage in political matters by the unauthorized use of its corporate funds to become an active force in a political contest would in my opinion be to sanction an infringement upon the rights of voters who alone either as individuals or through political organizations may elect directly or indirectly officials in advocacy of the principles for which they contend To encourage the unauthorized use of corporate funds for political purposes might result in the creatures of the State becoming its masters Any unauthorized act of a corporation that affects public interests with such serious and farreaching consequences is a menace to the State and against public policy Later he adds If I am correct in assuming that a corporate gift for political pur poses is wrongful and therefore illegal then in a case where a trustee of a corporation like that of a life insurance company who knowingly consciously and deliberately appropriates the money of the corporation to the use of a political campaign committee there would be present all the elements required to establish the commission of the crime of larceny and reasonable grounds for believing that the person charged committed it unless we may say as a matter of law that one charged with the commission of a crime may escape its consequences by admitting the facts that prima facie would establish it and pleading ignorance of their legal effect and absence of intent to do any wrong These views were rejected unanimously by the Appellate Division While the members of this tribunal filed separate opinions which contain a considerable variety of reasoning they agreed in the conclusion that the information laid before the magistrate did not furnish reasonable ground to believe that the relator had committed the crime of larceny None of them look upon the contribution to a party campaign fund by the officers 1 Greenbaum J 50 Misc 198 208 209 I00 N Y Supp 427COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW of a life insurance company of 48500 of the companys money as illegal It was at most an ultra vires act It was neither malum prohibitum nor malum in se As the relator declared that he believed this expenditure to be for the benefit of the com pany and that he derived no personal advantage of any kind from the transaction these judges were of the opinion that there was nothing sufficient to justify the imputation of criminal intent or design on the part of the relator to steal moneys of the insurance company by appropriating them to his own use or to the use of some one other than the corporation It should also be noted that the members of this court assume that the alleged larceny of the relator consists in his receiving and applying to his own use the moneys paid over to him in December His claim to such moneys say these judges was based upon the promise of President McCall which had been approved by the finance committee While such promise might be ultra vires and unenforceable at law it was a sufficient basis for the relators claim to the sum which was paid to him and brought his case within  548 of the New York Penal Code2 Upon an indictment for larceny it is a sufficient defense that the property was appropriated openly and avowedly under a claim of title preferred in good faith even though such claim is untenable This theory of the case was rejected by the Court of Appeals The alleged crime of the relator was admitted by the majority as well as the minority judges to consist in aiding and abetting President McCall in turning over 48500 of the companys funds to the Republican National Campaign Committee3 Opinion of Patterson J II3 App Div at p 347 2 Opinion of Ingraham J Ibid at p 337 opinion of McLaughlin J Ibid at p 340 opinion of Laughlin J Ibid at p 349 3 The act of the president of the insurance company wnich the relator may be regarded as abetting section 29 Pen Code that is the contribution of corporate funds for the purposes of a political campaign Gray J i87 N Y at p 420 80 N E at p 386 and while the con tribution was suggested and made by the authority and direction of the president of the company rather than by the relator still the latter was so a party to the execution of the act that he must be regarded as having aided and abetted it and therefore is criminally responsible if a crime was committed Hiscock J I87 N Y at p 425 80 N E at p 388 it is also unnecessary to consider whether the relator as an officer of the company had at the time in his possession custody or control the funds or property of the company within the provisions of the Penal Code Certainly the president had such custody and control and by section 29 of the Penal Code a person who aids or abets the commission of a crime or directly or indirectly counsels its commission is equally a principal with the person who commits the acts Nor have the pro 390LARCENY AND THE PERKINS CASE 391 The members of this court also agreed in holding that it is not necessary to the crime of larceny that the property be appro priated lucri causal They were unanimous too in holding that the contribution by the President of the New York Life Insurance Company from its funds of 50000 to a political campaign committee even in the absence of any statutory prohibition was absolutely beyond the purposes for which that corporation existed and was wholly unjustifiable and illegal2 While the judges were all agreed that the contribution in question was wholly unjustifiable and illegal they differed as to the inferences to be drawn from the relators connection with the matter The majority were of the opinion that the facts did not warrant the inference of the criminal intent necessary to larceny Said Judge Gray writing for the majority In the facts stated in these depositions I find none upon which criminality can be predicated The essential element of the intent to deprive and defraud3 is nowhere to be found and there is no just basis for the inference There was no concealment about the transaction and knowledge of it was conveyed to the other trustees That the relator may have made a mistake of law which will not relieve him from liability in a civil action may be true and he expressly disclaimed in his letter any intention to dispute such a liability but this was a case where the intent or good faith was in issue and then knowledge of the law is im material    The facts showed that the design to injure the motive to despoil the company the wrongful purpose were all lacking in the information which was laid before the magistrate and upon which the warrant issued This being so the act of the magistrate was wholly without jurisdiction and the warrant and all proceedings under it were absolutely void Judge Hiscock who wrote a second majority opinion ex pressed himself as follows visions of section 548 that it is a sufficient defense to indictment for larceny that the property was appropriated openly under a claim of title in good faith any application to the case The crime if there was any in this case commenced when the original agreement was made between the relator and the president by which the money of the company was to be appropriated to the use of Bliss and the method was adopted for the purpose of concealing such appropriation that the relator should in the first instance pay the money to Bliss and thereafter receive the money of the company The repayment to the relator was not an inde pendent transaction but part of the original scheme and must stand or fall with the legality or criminality of that scheme Cullen C J i87 N Y at p 434 80 N E at p 391 1 Opinion of Gray J i87 N Y at p 419 opinion of Cullen C J Ibid at p 438 citing Reg v White 1840 9 C  P 344 2 Opinion of Hiscock J 187 N Y at p 425 80 N E at p 388 3 The language of the Code is intent to deprive or defraudCOLUMBIA LAW REVIEW There is wanting every one of those circumstances of personal gain furtive secrecy in the commission of the act and of concealment after commission which as essential elements ordinarily attend the crime of larceny and if there is any evidence here of a criminal intent it is found simply and solely in the fact that the officers of the corpora tion have contributed some of its funds to an unauthorized purpose As already indicated it does not seem to me that this fact is sufficient to sustain the burden thus cast upon the prosecution On the other hand Chief Judge Cullen writing for the minor ity asserted that the magistrate to whom the depositions were pre sented might well infer a criminal intent on the part of Mr Perkins and Mr McCall His view is thus stated The relator and the president of the company without the authority of the corporation and knowing that all the beneficial owners would never assent to the act took the moneys of the company without con sideration and appropriated them to the exclusive use of a third party The relator must be presumed to have known the law and to have in tended the natural consequences of his acts which were to deprive the company of the money If he knew the illegality of his act and his inten tion was solely to benefit either Mr Bliss personally or the political organization which he represented then he was guilty of larceny If however as asserted in his statements to the district attorney he believed that the expenditure would be for the benefit of the company and that the president had the power to make the same then however mistaken on the subject he was not guilty This was necessarily and properly a question of fact to be determined by the magistrate not one of law Though the prosecution put in evidence before the magistrate the written statement of the relator the magistrate was at liberty to believe it or to reject it in whole or in part1 The indirect method in which the payment to Mr Bliss was made and the fact concealed by having the money in the first instance advanced by the relator instead of by the company and the method in which the relator was reimbursed by a check not to him personally but to the order of J P Morgan  Co a banking firm with which the corporation may have large legitimate dealings casts suspicion on the good faith of the relator and might be considered by the magistrate as militating against him The explanation of this course offered by the relator that it was to relieve the president from solicita tions from other political parties might also be discredited It is diffi cult to imagine how the representatives of other parties would have access to the companys books nor would the scheme of payment enable the officers of the company when solicited to say that the company had made no contributions to other parties because such an answer would be as essentially a falsehood as if the money had been paid by the com pany in the first instance The concealment of the payment as described 1 People v Van Zile I894 143 N Y 368 38 N E 380 Beckerv Koch I887 I04 N Y 394 io N E 70I 58 Am Rep 515 President etc Manhattan Co v Phillips i888 o09 N Y 383 17 N E I29 392LARCENY AND THE PERKINS CASE 393 would warrant the magistrate in finding that the parties were conscious of wrongdoing in making it and feared exposure The relator asserts that he was ignorant of the character of the entries made in the companys books and there is no proof to the contrary of this statement But he must have known that the check to pay him was drawn not to himself but to Morgan  Co On the other hand there is doubtless to be con sidered in the relators favor the fact that he made no pecuniary profit by the transaction and that he afterwards openly admitted his par ticipation in it All this however merely raised a question of fact to be passed on by the magistrate with whose determination other courts cannot interfere in this proceeding It is apparent from the foregoing extracts that the judges differed in their conception of what constitutes criminal intent in larceny under the Penal Code of New York This difference is made still more apparent by the following quotations Judge Hiscock writes It may be difficult at all times exactly and satisfactorily to define this intent but the requirement for it as applicable to this case means that when the relator took part in the appropriation of the moneys in question he must have had in some degree that same conscious unlawful and wicked purpose to disregard and violate the property rights of another which the ordinary burglar has when he breaks into a house at night with the preconceived design of stealing the property of its in mates Chief Judge Cullen declares The meritorious character of the object to which the money was appropriated has no bearing on the question of larceny The gist of that offense is not the application of money to a bad purpose but taking money that does not belong to the taker to appropriate to an object good or bad In other words according to the majority view the prosecu tion does not make out a case of larceny even under the Code provision quoted in the early part of this article unless it shows that the prisoner had in some degree the conscious unlawful and wicked purpose to disregard and violate property rights of another which characterize the ordinary burglar According to the minority while no one can become a thief or an embezzler by accident or mistake the prosecution makes out a prima facie case of larceny by showing that a defendant who having in his possession custody or control as an officer of a corporation prop erty of such corporation appropriates the same to his own use or that of any other person than the corporation with the intent to deprive the corporation of the propertyCOLUMBIA LAW REVIEW It is submitted that the minority view is preferable to that of the majority The provisions of the Code do not bear out the statement that one is not guilty of larceny who has not the con scious unlawful and wicked purpose of the ordinary burglar If we compare the definition of larceny in the present Code with that which was formerly contained in the New York Revised Statutes it becomes apparent that the legislature did not antici pate any such gloss being put upon its later language Under the earlier statute larceny consisted in the felonious taking and car rying away of the person or property of another1 But the Code omits the word felonious and without any adjective or qualify ing phrase declares that larceny consists in the taking or appro priation of anothers property with the intent to deprive him of it or of its use or benefit Again the Penal Code provides  549 The fact that the defendant intended to restore the property stolen or embezzled is no ground of defense or of mitigation of punish ment if it has not been restored before complaint to a magistrate charg ing the commission of the crime Surely one who takes or appropriates the property of another in violation of  528 and thereby steals it but who intends to restore it to the owner has not the conscious unlawful and wicked purpose of the ordinary burglar but the absence of such purpose does not make his crime anything other than larceny Counsel for the prosecution asked the court to adopt the following doctrine as governing this case and others like it A corporate officer paying out funds of the corporation without consideration moving to it and without authority of its members or directors for a purpose foreign to its business if not also against public policy and known or feared by him to be wrong although payments for that specific purpose have not been specifically covered by any provision of the Penal Code nevertheless commits the crime of larceny Is it not clear that the adoption of such a doctrine by a unani mous court would have produced a better effect than the decision which was rendered in this case Would it not have exercised a wholesome influence in restraining directors who belong to the modern school of high finance and in protecting stockholders and the public without harming any honest and faithful officer or director Such a doctrine it is submitted would better accord with the language and purpose of the New York Penal Code than that announced by the majority of the judges FRANCIS A BURDICK N Y Rev St Vol 2 p 679 63 394

J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1009200,NOTES,I242521,BOOK DEPARTMENT NOTES WVHATEVER THE ATTITUDE TAKEN REGARDING THE PRACTICABILITY OF SOLVING THE PROBLEM OF UNEMPLOYMENT BY THE CREATION OF SPECIAL INSTITUTIONS FOR THE INSURANCE OF WORKINGMEN AGAINST THIS EVIL THE MOVEMENT IN THIS DIRECTION IS ONE THAT NO STUDENT OF SOCIAL REFORM CAN AFFORD TO OVERLOOK EFFORTS TO INTRODUCE THIS SPECIES OF INSURANCE DATE BACK BUT A FEW YEARS YET THE LITERATURE UPON THE SUBJECT IS ALREADY A CONSIDERABLE ONE THE MOVEMENT AS IS WELL KNOWN HAS THUS FAR BEEN CHIEFLY CONFINED TO SWITZERLAND WHERE OUTOFWORK INSURANCE FUNDS HAVE BEEN CREATED BY THE MUNICIPALITIES OF BERNE AND SAINTGALL AND IMPORTANT STUDIES OF THE QUESTION LOOKING TO FUTURE ACTION HAVE BEEN MADE BY THE TOWNS OF BASEL ZURICH AND LAUSANNE A SIMILAR FUND ORGANIZED UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE CITY HAS ALSO BEEN IN OPERATION FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AT COLOGNE MR GEORGES CORNIL A BELGIAN AUTHOR HAS UNDERTAKEN TO BRING TOGETHER IN A COMPACT PAMPHLET OF 200 PAGES THE ESSENTIAL PORTIONS OF THE ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS SUCH AS THE CONSTITUTIONS AND REPORTS OF THE VARIOUS FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED AND THE IMPORTANT PROPO SITIONS MADE ELSEWHERE FOR THE INSURANCE OF WORKINGMEN AGAINST UNEMPLOYMENT  THOUGH THE AUTHOR MAKES NO PRETENCE OF PRESENT ING A CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF THE SUBJECT STATING FRANKLY THAT HIS WORK HAS BEEN THAT OF COMPILATION AND TRANSLATION HE HAS NEVERTHE LESS IN HIS INTRODUCTORY AND EXPLANATORY REMARKS GIVEN A CLEAR ACCOUNT OF THE HISTORY AND GENERAL CHARACTER OF EACH SCHEME HE ALSO CONSIDERS SEVERAL OF THE MORE IMPORTANT INSTANCES WHERE LABOR ORGANIZATIONS ON THE CONTINENT HAVE A REGULAR SYSTEM FOR THE INDEM NIFICATION OF THEIR MEMBERS WHEN OUT OF EMPLOYMENT THE CHIEF VALUE OF HIS WORK HOWEVER IS THAT HERE THE STUDENT CAN FIND UNDER ONE COVER THE ESSENTIAL DATA UPON WHICH TO BASE A FURTHER STUDY OF THE QUESTION AND THAT THUS THE NECESSITY OF COLLECTING THE VARIOUS CONSTITUTIONS AND REPORTS OF THE FUNDS WHICH WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR MOST AMERICAN STUDENTS IS OBVIATED AN EXCELLENT BIBLIOGRAPHY PRECEDES THE STUDY IT IS WEILL KNOWN THAT THE DIFFERENTIAL RATES BY RAIL BETWEEN THE MIDDLE WEST AND THE CITIES OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC SEABOARD HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED DURING THE PAST YEAR BY THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE COM MISSION THE INVESTIGATION WAS MADE AT THE INSTANCE OF THE NEW YORK  LASSURANCE MUNICIPALE CONTRE LE CHOMAGE INVOLUNTAIRE BY M GEORGES COR NIL PP XI I9I BRUXELLES IMPRIMERIE UNIVERSITAIRE X898 112PRODUCE EXCHANGE WHOSE CHIEF COMPLAINT WAS THAT THE DIFFERENTIALS ON GRAIN FLOUR AND PROVISIONS OF TWO CENTS IN FAVOR OF PHILADELPHIA AND THREE CENTS IN FAVOR OF BALTIMORE AS COMPARED WITH NEW YORK WERE UNJUST TO THE EXPORTERS OF NEW YORK THE CONCLUSIONS AT WHICH THE COMMISSION ARRIVED AS THE RESULT OF ITS INVESTIGATION WERE THAT THE DIFFERENTIALS ARE LEGITIMATELY BASED UPON THE COMPETITIVE RELATIONS OF THE CARRIERS THAT IT DOES NOT APPEAR UPON THE PRESENT RECORD THAT THE CARRIERS HAVE EXCEEDED THE LIMIT WITHIN WHICH THEY ARE FREE TO DETERMINE FOR THEMSELVES AND ACCORDINGLY THAT THE DIFFERENTIALS COMPLAINED OF DO NOT RESULT IN UNLAWFUL PREFERENCE OR ADVANTAGE TO PHILADELPHIA OR BALTIMORE OVER THE CITY OF NEW YORK  TO THE STUDENT OF TRANSPORTATION THE IMPORTANCE OF THE COMMIS SIONS REPORT IS NOT SO MUCH IN THE CONCLUSIONS ARRIVED AT AS IN THE MANNER IN WHICH THE TRANSPORTATION PROBLEM INVOLVED WAS DISCUSSED THE FORCES WHICH INFLUENCE RAILWAY CHARGES IN THE UNITED STATES WERE ANALYZED WITH CLEARNESS AND PERSPICACITY BY COMMISSIONER PROUTY IN HIS LENGTHY AND ABLY WRITTEN REPORT STUDENTS OF TRANS PORTATION WILL AT ONCE COMPARE THIS REPORT WITH THE CLASSIC ONE MADE ON THE SAME SUBJECT IN 1882 BY THE ADVISORY COMMISSION CONSISTING OF MESSRS THURMAN WASHBURNE AND COOLEY AND THE COMPARISON CANNOT FAIL TO REVEAL THE FACT THAT IMPORTANT CHANGES HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN THE TRANSPORTATION PROBLEM DURING THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS THE FORCES AFFECTING CHARGES ON RAIL TRAFFIC BETWEEN THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND THE ATLANTIC SEABOARD HAVE BECOME MORE COMPLEX AND IT HAS BECOME MORE DIFFICULT TO MEASURE THE INFLUENCES WHICH THEY SEVERALLY EXERT THIS IS TANTAMOUNT TO SAYING THAT WITH THE PROGRESS OF OUR INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT THE RAILWAY TRANSPORTATION SERVICES ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY INTERRELATED AND INTERDEPENDENT ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE UNIFIED SUCH EXPRESSIONS AS THE TRANSPORTATION SERVICE AND THE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM ARE BECOMING ACCURATE AS WELL AS CONVENIENT TERMS THOSE PERSONS WHO HAVE NOT GIVEN THE RAILWAY TRANSPORTATION PROBLEM SPECIAL STUDY WILL BE SURPRISED AT THE NUMBER OF CONSIDERATIONS TO WHICH WEIGHT WAS GIVEN BY THE COMMISSION IN PASSING JUDGMENT UPON THE FAIRNESS OF THE EXISTING FREIGHT CHARGES BETWEEN THE NORTH ATLANTIC SEABOARD AND THE CENTRAL WEST MR PROUTYS FULL AND JUDICIAL STATEMENT OF THE REPORT AND OPINION OF THE INTERSTATE COM MERCE COMMISSION IN THIS CASE

JOSEPH EDWARDS PRESENTS SEVERAL NOVEL FEATURES IN ADDITION TO THE USUAL DIRECTORY OF LECTURES ON SOCIAL AND POLITICAL REFORM AND THE REPORTS OF LEADING REFORM ORGANIZATIONS IT CONTAINS AN ARTICLE BY HENRY GEORGE ON THE GREAT BATTLE OF LABOUR AN ACCOUNT OF LABOUR LEGISLATION IN I897 AND A SERIES OF BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES OF LEADING REFORMERS ILLUSTRATED WITH FORTYFIVE PORTRAITS THE VALUE OF THE PUBLICATION MIGHT BE GREATLY INCREASED IF ADVERTISE MENTS WERE RIGIDLY EXCLUDED FROM THE BODY OF THE WORK AND IF THE MATERIAL WERE PRESENTED IN MORE ORDERLY AND LOGICAL FORM IN PLACE OF A TABLE OF CONTENTS AN INDEX INTRODUCES THE WORK THIS IS FOL LOWED BY THE DIRECTORY OF REFORM LECTURERS AND WRITERS BOTH OF THESE WOULD COME MORE PROPERLY AT THE END WHERE A MORE DETAILED INDEX WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE NOTWITHSTANDING FAULTS OF ARRANGEMENT HOW EVER THE LABOUR ANNUAL CONTAINS A GREAT DEAL OF USEFUL INFORMA TION NOT OTHERWISE AVAILABLE AND IT IS TO BE HOPED THE EDITOR WILL BE ENCOURAGED TO CONTINUE ITS PUBLICATION IN COMING YEARS IN HIS LECTURES ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT T MR LAWRENCE GOMME HAS DESIGNED TO SET FORTH IF POSSIBLE THE LINES UPON WHICH THE PRINCIPLES OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE STUDIED HIS WORK IS SCHOLARLY SHOWING CAREFUL RESEARCH AND IT IS OF PERMANENT VALUE BUT ITS USEFULNESS IS GREATLY IMPAIRED BY THE FACT THAT ONLY A MINOR PORTION OF THE CONTENTS OF THE BOOK IS IN HARMONY WITH ITS TITLE IN OUR OPINION AN EFFORT TO PROVE THAT THE MODERN ENGLISH SHIRE IS THE DIRECT OUTGROWTH OF THE OLD TRIBAL DIVISION THAT THE BOROUGH IS THE DESCENDANT OF THE OLD ROMAN TOWN AND THAT THE EXISTING PARISH OR TOWNSHIP IS THE HEIR OF THE MANOR DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A TREATISE ON THE PRINCIPLES OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE ARGUMENT IS ABLY PRESENTED ALTHOUGH THE AUTHOR HAS NOT THE SPACE TO DEVELOP IT AS HE WOULD WISH BUT ITS ONLY JUSTIFICATION IN THE PRESENT BOOK IS MR GOMMES BELIEF THAT LOCALITIES FORMED BY THE COMMON INTERESTS OF A COM MUNITY DATING CENTURIES BACK ARE THE FOUNDATION OF LOCAL GOVERN MENT IN THIS CONCLUSION WE DO NOT AGREE AND THE COUNTY OF LONDON BASED ON NO SUCH ANCIENT DIVISION SEEMS TO OPPOSE THE AUTHORS VIEW THE REAL POINT AT ISSUE IS WHETHER

AIMS AND DUTIES OF LOCAL GOVERN MENT THE AUTHOR DOES NOT REACH AS DEFINITE CONCLUSIONS AS IN THE FIRST PART OF HIS WORK HE DOES US A SERVICE BY SHOWING THE COM PLICATIONS EXISTING BEFORE X888 WHEN TWENTYSEVEN THOUSAND DISCON NECTED AUTHORITIES TRIED TO PERFORM THE DUTIES AND AVOID THE DANGERS OF LOCAL RULE HIS SUGGESTION THAT THE BURDEN OF TAXATION ONLY ARISES WHEN THE AMOUNT PAID IS IN EXCESS OF THE BENEFIT RECEIVED AND IS THEN ONLY SUCH EXCESS IS EXCELLENT HE IS NOT EQUALLY SUCCESSFUL IN HIS ATTEMPT TO FIX A LIMIT TO THE POWERS SUITABLE FOR A LOCAL GOVERNMENT REJECTING AS INSUFFICIENT MILLS DEFINITION OF THE SERVICE WHICH SUCH A GOVERNMENT SHOULD PERFORM MR GONMME RE PLACES IT WITH THE STATEMENT THAT THE SERVICES PROPERLY ADMINISTERED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE THOSE OF GENERAL UTILITY UNLESS THE LIMITS ARE BETTER KNOWN IN ENGLAND THAN THEY ARE IN THE UNITED STATES THE SERVICEABLENESS OF SUCH A DEFINITION IS OPEN TO QUESTION DR CHARLES GROSS HAS RENDERED A SERVICE OF INESTIMABLE VALUE TO STUDENTS OF ENGLISH INSTITUTIONS BY THE PUBLICATION OF A BIBLI OGRAPHY OF BRITISH MUNICIPAL HISTORY  WHICH DESERVES TO TAKE RANK AMONG THE FEW FIRST RATE BIBLIOGRAPHIES WHICH

GREAT NUMBER RECEIVED SUFFI CIENT POPULAR FAVOR TO BECOME PART OF THE CONSTITUTION WE REALIZE HOW DIFFICULT SUCCESSFUL AMENDMENT IS AND WHAT A LONG RECORD OF UNSUC CESSFUL EFFORT IS HERE TOLD IT MIGHT SEEM THAT THE LABOR OF THE LEARNED AUTHOR WAS WASTED IN DESCRIBING THESE FAILURES BUT THIS IS HARDLY A FAIR WAY TO ESTIMATE THE VALUE OF THE BOOK IT THROWS VALUABLE SIDE LIGHTS ON THE POLITICAL MOVEMENTS IN OUR COUNTRYS HISTORY AND IS MOST CLEAR IN POINTING OUT HOW WISE THE FOUNDERS WERE IN EMBODYING ONLY GENERAL PRINCIPLES INTO THE CONSTITUTION HOW MUCH HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED BY INTERPRETATION AND CONVENTION AND HOW THE PARTS OF THE CONSTITUTION WHICH ADMIT OF NO SUCH DEVEL OPMENT ARE THE ONES WHICH SUFFER MOST BY THE RIGIDITY OF OUR SYSTEM OF AMENDMENT THE BOOK IS NOT ONE

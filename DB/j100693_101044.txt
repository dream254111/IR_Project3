LANGUEDOC IN FRANCE BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE MOST CHRISTIAN KING LOUYS XIV AND THE CONTRIVANCE AND MANAGEMENT OF MONSICUR RIQUET ENGLISHED BY THE PUBLISHER OUT OF THE FRENCH LATELY SENT TO THE SAME FROM PATIS TOGETHER WITH THE PRINTED MAPP OF THE SAID CHANNEL HERE CONTRACTEDAND EXPLAINED IT IS NOT NOW THAT THE CONJUNCTION OR COMMUNICATION OF THE SEAS HATH BEEN THOUGHT POSSIBLE IT HATH BEEN ALWAYS AGREED UPON THAT IT WAS SOAND THAT MANY WAYSEVEN WITH IN THE BOUNDS OF FRANCEWITHOUT ANY DEPENDANCE ON OR PARTICIPA TION WITH THE NEIGHBOURING COUNTRYS THEREOF THE THING HATH Q QQQQ ALSO1124 ASO BEEN OFTEN PROPOSED UNDER THE REIGNES OF HENRY IV AND LOUYS XIII OF MOST GLORIOUS MEMO Y BUT WHETHER IT BE THAT IT HATH EVER BEEN JUDGED TOO DIFFICULT OR TOO EXPENCEFULL OR THAT THOSE GREAT PR NCES WERE ENGAGED IN MORE URGENT AFFAIRES OR THAT THEIR MINISTERS WOULD NOT APPLY THEMSELVES TO IT IN GOOD EARNEST SO IT ISTHAT IT HATH BEEN HITHERTO REJECTEDAND AS TWERE RESERVED FOR THE GLORY OF OUR PRESENT GREAT MONARCH LOUYS XIV MONSIEUR RIQUET WHO LONG SINCE HAD CONSIDERED THE THING BY HIMSELF HAVING OPEND IT TO THE LORD COLBERT WAS HAP PY ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM RELISH IT BY SHEWING HIM THE ADVAN TAGES WHICH THEN MIGHT ACCRUE TO THE KINGDOM BY FACILITATING COMMERCE AND BY DECLARING TO HIM THE DIFFICULTIES TO BE GRAPLED WITH IN THIS WORKTOGETHER WITH THE MEANS OF SURMOUN TING THE SAME THIS GREAT MINISTER WHO INCESSANTLY WATCH ETH FOR THE GLORY OF THE KING AND THE INTERESTS OF THE STATE AND LETS NO OCCASIONS ESCAPE OF PROCURING THEM SOON ACQUAIN TED HIS MAJESTY THEREWITH WHO HAVING A HIGH CONCERN FOR WHAT MAY RENDER HIS KINGDOM HAPPY AND FLORISHING GLADLY HEARKE NED TO HIMPUT THE THING IN DELIBERATION AND HAVING RESOLVED FOR IT GAVE A GENERAL COMMISSION TO M RIQUET ESTEEN ED BY HIS MAJESTY THE MOST CAPABLE PERSON FOR EXECUTING SUCH A DESIGN THIS DIFFICULTY BEING OVERCOME AND M RIQUET HAVING SATIS FIED THE OBJECTIONS MADE BY SEVERAL SORTS OF PEOPLE AGAINST THIS ENTERPRISE IT WAS NECESSARY BEFORE THE ACTUAL UNDERTAKING OF THE WORK TO RESOLVE UPON THE CHOYCE THAT WAS TO BE MADE OF THE TWO WAYSBY WHICH THE CHANNEL WAS TO BE CARRYED FROM THE RIVER GARRONE TO THE AUDE SOME OF THE INTERESSD WOULD HAVE IT CARRYED ALL ALONG TO THE PLAINS REACHING FROM CAERCASSO NE TO THOLOSE OTHERS WOULD HAVE IT RUN INTO THE RIVER FRESQUEIL FROM THENCE INTO THE PLAIN OF REVEL AND THENCE INTO THE RIVER AGOUTAND SO INTO THE GARONNE M RIQUET FOLLOWD NEITHER OF THOSE TWO WAYS BUT FORMD THENCE A THIRD WHICH WAS TO MAKE USE OF WHAT WAS BEST IN THESE TWO WAYS BY TAKING FROM THE FORMER WHAT IT HAD OF GOOD CONVENIENT COUNTRY FROM THE POINT OF SEPARATION DESCRIBED BELOW TO THOLOSE AND FROM THE LATTERWHAT ADVANTAGE THE BED OF FRESQUEIL WOULD AFFORD HIM YET SOTHAT WHEREAS SOME PRETENDED TO MAKE THIS CHANNEL OF COM MUNICATION1125 MUNICATION PASS INTO THE VERY CHANNELS OF THE LITTLE RIVERS LERS FRESQUEIL AUDE MONSIEUR RIQUET MAKETH HIS CHANNEL PASSAS MUCH AS HE CANIN THE ADJACENT PLAINSLEAVING THE ANCIENT CHAN NELS OF THOSE RIVERS TO SERVE FOR RECEIVING AND CARRYING AWAY THE GREAT AND FREQUENT INUNDATIONS OF WATERS AND THEREBY SECURING THE NEW CHANNEL FROM THE DANGER OF BEING INCONVENIENCED BY THEM THE HIGHEST PLACE OF THE WHOLE CHANNEL WAS WELL ENOUGH KNOWN WHICH WAS TO BE THE POINT CALLD THE POINT OF DIVISION OR SEPARATION NATURE HERSELF SUFFICIENTLY POINTED AT IT BY THE SPRING OF GRAVEWHICH PARTLY RUNS TOWARDS THE OCEANAND PART LY TOWARDS THE MEDITERRANEAN AND TIS NEAR THIS PLACEWHERE THE GREAT BASON IS MADE TO RECEIVE THE WATERS THAT ARE TO RUN BOTH SIDES OF THE CHANNEL BUT THIS WATER BEING NOT NEAR SUFFICIENT IT WAS NECESSARY TO FIND OUT OTHERSTHAT MIGHT BE HIGH ENOUGH TO FALL INTO THE SAID BASONAND ABOUNDING ENOUGH RO KEEP IT ALWAYS FULL AND TO FURNISH FOR THE SLUCES OF THOSE TWO PARTS OF THE GREAT CHANNEL IT APPEARD ALSO THAT THIS PLENTY OF WATERS COULD NOT BE HAD BUT FROM THE BLACK MOUNTAIN DISTANT ENOUGH FROM IT BUT IT DID NOR APPEARHOW THIS COULD BE EFFECTED IN SHORT TIS THIS WHERE IN THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY OF THE WHOLE WORK DID CONSIST FOR WE MUST KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY SPRINGS ISSUING FROM THE HIGHER PART OF THAT MOUNTAINAND THAT AMONG THE REST THERE ARE FIVE GREAT ONESWHICH MAKE AS MANY SMALL RIVERS THAT ARE NEVER DRYED UP AND RUN ALONG THE HILLOCKS OF THIS MOUNTAINAND FALL TO GETHER INTO THE RIVER FRESQUEIL BUT SO FAR ABOVE THE SAID POINT OF SEPARATION THAT THAT REMOTENESS WOULD RENDER THEM ABSOLUTELY USELESS IT NOT BEING POSSIBLE TO MAKE THEM REMOUNT WHERE FORE TO MAKE THEM SERVE FOR THIS PURPOSE IT WAS NECESSARY TO IN TERRUPT THEIR NATURAL COURSE FROM NORTH TO SOUTHAND TO GIVE THEM A CONTRARY ONEFROM EAST TO WEST BY DIGGING A CONDUIT FOR THEM CROSS THE MOUNTAINTHROUGH PLACESWHICH ARE ALL STEEP ROCKS AND HORRID PRECIPICES THERE WAS THEN A NECESSITY TO MAKE THOSE FIVE RIVERS RUN THE FIRST INTO THE SECONDAND THE SECOND INTO THE THIRDFOURTH AND FIFTH AND TO REUNITE THEM ALL IN THE DERI VING CHANNEL WHICH AT LAST CARRIES THEM TO THE POINT OF SEPA RATION FOR THE END ABOVEMENTIONED Q QQQQ 2 AS1126 AS FOR THE PARTICULARS OF THIS GREAT WORK THE ANNEXED MAPP WILL GIVE FARTHER INFORMATION OF THEM IN IT A THE POINT OF SEPARATION BEING BENEATH THE TOWN OF MONTFERAND NEAR THE HIGH WAY OF THOLOSE BELOW THE STONES OF NAUROUZE IT IS SO CALLED BECAUSE THAT FROM THIS PLACE THE WATERS RUN NATURALLY ON ONE SIDETO THE O CEANBY THE GARONNEAND ON THE OTHERTOWARDS THE MEDITERRANEAN BY THE AU DE IN THAT PLACE IS TO BE A GREAT BASON OCTOGONAL OVALWISE 200 FATHOMS LONG AND 150 FATH LARGE WHICH SHALL BE SURROUNDED WITH 72 HOUSES TO BE RAISED ON ARCHES OVER AGAINST WHICH THERE SHALL BE BUILT A KEY FOR THE CONVE NIENCE OF THOSE THAT SHALL DWEL THEREWHICH IS TO BE VERY SPATIOUS AND FACED WITH HEWEN STONE THIS GREAT BASON SHALL RECEIVE ALL THE WATERSWHICH THE DERI VING CHANNEL IS TO CONVEIGH THITHER FROM THE BLACK MOUNTAINTO BE DISTRIBU TED BY THE ROYAL CHANNEL TO BOTH SEAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS BASON SHALL BE A COLOFFE REPRESENTING THE KING STANDING IN A TRIUMPHANT CHARRETDRAWN BY FOUR SEAHORSES HOLDING ONE FOOT UPON A GLOBEAND A TRIDENT IN HIS HAND AS MARKS OF HIS GREATNESS BOTH BY SEA AND LAND AND THEN A STREAME OF WATER

HUNTING IT WAS FROM HENCE THAT IT WAS FOUND POSSIBLE TO MAKE THIS CHANNELBY THE MEANS OF THE FIVE RI VERS AND A GREAT NUMBER OF RIVOLETS ISSUING THENCE WITHOUT THE CONCOURSE WHEREOF IT HAD BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERTAKE IT AND TO RENDER IT NAVIGABLE IT IS IN THIS MOUNTAIN A GOOD WAY UNDER THE MILL OF CALZON THE RIVER SOR WHERE BEGINS THE CHANNEL OF DERIVATION WHICH HATH ITS DECLIVITIES THROUGH TERRIBLE PRECIPICES WHERE IT RECEIVES THE RIVERS BERNASTONE LAMPI RIETOR ALZAU AND LAMPILLON TO CONVEIGH THEM INTO THE MAGAZINE OF ST FE RIOL BY THE MEANS OF AN OTHER CONDUITWHEN NEED SHALL BE TO SILL

PRODIGIOUS QUANTITY OF WATER IT IS TO CONTAIN FOR IT WILL BE ABOVE TWELFHUNDRED FATHOMS LONG SIXHUNDRED LARGE AND TWENTY TWODEEP AND IS TO FURNISH EVERY MINUTE OF AN HOUR FOR SIX MONETHS OF THE YEAR MORE THAN EIGHT CUBIC FEET OF WATER THIS VAST STOREHOUSE IS BETWEEN 2 MOUNTAINS THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF WHICH RUNS THE SMALL REVOLET LAUDOT TIS TRUE NATURE HATH DONE SOMETHING WONDERFUL IN FORMING A DISPOSITION THERETO BUT TIS ALSO CERTAINTHAT ART HATH MUCH SURPASSED HER BY THE STRONG BANKS OR DAMS WHICH ARE THERE RAISD TO BEAR UP AGAINST SUCH A VAST QUANTITY OF WATER AS ALSO BY THE ADMIRABLE AQUEDUCTSTHAT ARE TO HAVE MORE THAN 80 FATHOMS IN LENGTHFOR GIVING THE MORE LIBERTY AND FACILITY TO THE WATERS TO RUN OUT WHEN THERE SHALL BE OCCASION AND LASTLY BY THE GREAT WALL WHICH IS 22 FATHOMS

TO THE POINT OF DIVISION L THE CAPE OF BON AMOUR SO CALLED BY REASON OF THE TWO CHANNELS WHERE THE ONECOMING FROM REVEL BRINGS THE WATERS WHICH WENT TO THE OCEAN AND THE OTHER WHICH COMES FROM THE MAGAZINE BRINGS THOSE OF THE BLACK MOUNTAIN THAT PASSD TOWARDS THE MEDITERRANEAN M THE PORT LOUYS NEAR REVELNEWLY BUILT FACED WITH HEWN STONES OF 20 FATHOM SQUARE WHERE THE LORD BOURLEMONT ARCHBISHOP OF THOLOSE AND M DE BEZONSINTENDANT OF JUSTICE IN LANGUEDOC ACCOMPANIED WITH MANY OF THE NOBILITY EMBARQUED IN MAY 1668 TO MAKE AN EXPERIMENT OF THIS LITLE CHANNEL AND ROWED ON TO THE STONES OF NAUROUZE WITH THAT SUCCESS THAT M RIQUETHAVING FOUND THE ADVANTAGES WHICH THE NEIGHBOU RING TOWNS AND VILLAGES MIGHT THENCE RECEIVE BESIDES THAT OF CARRYING THE WATERS TO THE POINT OF SEPARATION DID SO ENLARGE THE SAME THAT NOW IT CARRYES GREAT BOATS THOUGH IT BE ON THE DECTIVITY OF AN HILL WHITH CAUSETH WONDER IN ALL THOSE THAT SEE IT N THE CHANNEL THAT GOES FROM REVEL TO THE POINT OF SEPARATION O THE ROYAL CHANNEL WHICH GOES FROM THE GARONNE INTO THE LAKE OF THAU OR FRONTIGNAN IT IS TO BE IN ITS NARROWEST PLACES 9 OR 10 FATHOMS BROADAND AT LEAST 9 FOOT DEEP ACCORDING TO THE PLACES WHERE IT MUST BE MORE OR LESS DIGGED YOU MAY SEE IN THE ANNEXED MAPP A GREAT MANY RIVOLETS RIVERS AND PONDS WHICH IT TRAVERSETH AND WHICH IN WINTER ARE AS MANY TORRENTS1128 TORRENTS THAT WOULD CAUSE VERY GREAT

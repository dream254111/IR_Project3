construction and maintenance sof roads American roads are far below the average they cer tainly are among the worst in the civilized world and always have beenlargely as a result of permitting local circumstances to de ermine the location with little or no regard for any general sys em and haste and waste and ignorance in building Among the benefits attendant upon the proper construction and maintenance of roadways the speaker mentioned the following Good roads attract population as well as good schools and churches and they improve the value of property so that it is said a farm lying five miles from market connected by a bad road is of less aralue than an equally good farm lying ten miles away from mar ket connected by a good road A larger load can be drawn by one horse over a good road than by two over a bad one Good roads consequently encourage the greater exchange of products and commodities between one section and another besides being sof great value to railroads as feeders As one solution of the road problem ol Pope outlined the fol Oowing plan A commissioner of highways might be provided for in the Agricultural Department with a corps of consulting engi neers and suitabe appropriations made for the prosecution of a general supervising work Under the charge of this commission full systems of maps should be prepared based largely perhaps upon the working of the state and county boards showing more or less completely as circumstances would permit the highways of the country For cooperation with this central bureau and the prosecution tof the work in the most thorough and practical way each State should have its highway commissioner charged with the highest nterests of the State in the way of maintaining its system of roads wunder the most approved methods and for the general public wel fare Then the best practical results could probably be attained zby the division of the State into highway districts consisting of Scounties or perhaps townships each ofwhich should have its everseer in full charge of the opening and construction of new roads in his district and the proper maintenance of all responsible for the expenditure of the regular appropriations for these pur poses These districts could then be Edivided into smaller ones under suboverseers The importance and the value to any country any section and every citizen from the highest to the lowest whether taxpayers or tramps of wellconstructed and properly maintained roads are not easily estimated but clearly are greater than of many affairs which are continually receiving the time and attention of the people in their homes countingrooms public meetings and legislative halls It is a matter to be considered side by side with our splendid and always improving system of public education the assessrnent of our tariff duties or the appropriations regularly made for river and harbor improvements   R A PEtOCTOR MEMORIAL FUND THE English magazine KnowEedZge calis attention to the an nouncement in many of the London papers stating that the mone tary affairs of the late Mr Proctor have now been wound up by his administrator and that the total sum available as provision for his widow and the seven children four of whom are daughters and one a little boy a permanent invalid from hipdisease is un Sder 20so To the small income which this will produce there is to be added Ioo per annum from the Civil List which is how ever granted only during Mrs Proctors life The 2000 above referred to as the value of the residue after the settlement of all debts solne of which were waived has been produced by the sale of Mr Proctors copyrights Mrs Proctor and the eldest daughter have under a satisfactory arrangement with Messrs Longmans retained a small interest in the works nqw in Messrs Longmans hands including the iOld and New As tronomy which will shortly be completed But the value of the nterest retained calculated on the basis of the sum given for the remainder of these copyrights by Messrs Longmans is included in the 20 as is also the money received for all the other copy rights which were purchased on liberal terms either by Messrs Chatto  Windus or by Messrs W H Allen  Co The money given immediately after the death of the late Mr Proctor by the lloyal Literary Fund and the proceeds of five lec tures given byMr W Lant Carpenter as well as gifts from other friends have enabled the family who owing to the suddenness of Mr Proctors death were absolutely without resourcesJ to weather through the first year But these funds have now been exhausted and a committee is in course of formation which the many friends of Mr Proctor are invited to join Subscriptions to the R A Proctor Memorial Fund and communications will be received by Mr E

preparing fluorine has been discovered by M WIoissan This discovery is the outcome of the success which has attended M Moissans efforts to prepare anhydrous fluoride of platinum During the process of his memorable work upon the isolation of fluorine by the electrolysas of hydrofluoric acid contain ing hydrogen potassium fluoride one of the most remarkable phe nomena noticed was the rapidity with which the platinum rod form ing the positive electrode was corroded by the action of the liber ated gaseous fluorine It was surmised that a fluoride of platinum yvas the product of this action but hitherto all efforts to isolate sucb a body have proved unsuccessful In fact for a reason which will be discussed subsequently it is impossible to prepare platinum fluoride in the wet way M Moissan has however as stated in Latvre been enabled to prepare anhydrous platinum fluoride by the action of pure dry fluorine itself upon the metal It was found at the outset that when fluorine is free from admixed vapor of hydrofluoric acid it exerts no action whatever upon platinum even when the latter is in a finely divided state and heated to IooQ C But when the temperature of the metal is raised to between 500 and 600 C combination readily occurs with formation of tetra fluoride of platinum and a small quantity of protofluoride The moment the gas is mixed with a little vapor of hydrofluoric acid the action is immensely accelerated and then occurs readily at ordinary temperatures The same rapid action occurs when plati num i5 placed in llydrofluoric acid saturated withfree fluorine which accounts for the disappearance of the positive terminal dur ing the electrolysis In order to prepare the fluoride of platinum a bundle of wires of the metal is introduced into a thick platinum or fluorspar tube through which a current of fluorine gas from the electrolysis appa ratus is passed On heating the tube to low redness the wires be come rapidly converted to fluoride when they are quickly trans ferred to a dry stoppered bottle If the operation is performed in a platinum tube a large quantity of fused fluoride remains in the tube The tetrafluoride of platinum PtF4 formed upon the wires consists either of fused masses of a deep red color or of small buff colored crystals resembling anhvdrous platinum chloride It is exceedingly hygroscopic With water it behaves in a most curious manner With a small quantity of water it produces a fawn colored solution which almost immediately becomes warm and decomposes with precipitation of hydrated platinic oxide and free hydrofluoric acid If the quantity of water is greater and the temperature low the fawncolored solution may be preserved for a few minutes at the expiration of which or immediately on boiling the solution the fluoride decomposes in the manner above indi

10 per cent less worthy than the Sunday School attendants This variation is more marked in the case of delinquents Those who do not attend are 41 per cent below those attending in school standing In work and thrift nonattendants are 31 per cent poorer than attendantswhile general character of the former is 22 per cent below thatof the latter Work and Thrift As Compared to School Rating Economic hardships through death of one parent have had their influence on the boys work to their marked detriment in schooling as is noted when the school rating in such cases is 296 and work and thrift 423 a difference of nearly 43 per cent while in the case of where the boy lives with both his parents the same comparison is 374 to 462a difference of 132 per cent Ratings of Delinquents As Compared with Those of NonDelinquent Newsboys One of the most interesting deductions from this table is the accurate tabu lating of comparative ratings of delinquents and of underprivileged boys who are not delinquent In school rating the nondelinquent averages 375 and the delinquent averages 313 or an average lowering in school standing of 162 per cent In work and thrift the nondelinquent averages 485 and the delinquent aver ages 322 or an average diminution of 332 per cent In general character the nondelinquent averages 477 and the delinquent averages 268 or an alarming reduction of nearly 44 per cent in character Public Defender Proposed for MarylandThe cry that there is one law for the rich and another for the poor has created considerable discussion recently Regardless of what ones views upon this point may be there can be no doubt that there are very many people who through ignorance or because of poverty are constantly being denied justice Especially is this serious where a person is charged with a criminal offense and is too poor to employ an attor ney or to have a thorough investigation of the facts in his case made Fully onehalf of the persons charged with offenses in our criminal courts are too poor to employ attorneys at all as can be seen by any one caring to look over the assignments of theclerks office in the Criminal Court The result is con siderable injustice to the poor and helpless and this in spite of every effort of officials from the judge down to ameliorate the situation To correct this weakness in our legal procedure there has been introduced in the legislature a bill for a public defender in criminal cases It is intended as a complete solution of the difficulty in the existing administration of the criminal law It puts the poor man on an equal plane with the rich in the criminal court It gives him a square deal It remedies some of the most glaring abuses which have brought the criminal law in disrepute The public defender as a state official will have investigators whose busi ness it will be to see that all the facts of the case are obtained before trial His staff will be on a plane with that of the prosecuting attorney so that even though the prisoner has not a nickle to his name he will be assured an honest and capable defense PUBLIC DEFENDER 310PUBLIC DEFENDER 311 The law presumes every man innocent until proved guilty In practice however it is for the prisoner especially if he has been in trouble before to prove his innocence The states attorney does not know all the facts favoring the accused The grand jury hears only one side and neither the accused his counsel nor his witnesses are heard Their presence is prohibited Six minutes per case is the average deliberation of the grand jury in Baltimore according to Mr Roland Marchant Deputy States Attorney under Mr Brocning In New York City the average is seven minutes There is absolutely no reason to believe that the prosecuting officer acts as much for the accused as for the prosecution In practice he simply represents the state and no one else Even if he aims at fairness to the defendant he seldom knows the defendants story for the reason that in large cities he is a very busy official and has hardly sufficient time to prepare the states case much less the defendants Much of the unfair conduct of prosecuting officials generally is due not so much to a desire to be unfair but rather to the difficulty under which he labors He is opposed by lawyers who are willing in their defenses tc use every trick strategy subterfuge and device in their repertoire to delay or defeat justice He is forced to adopt an aggressive distrustful partisan attitude which is not consistent with the theory of official impartiality To expect him ade quately to represent both sides is as every lawyer knows to expect the impos sible As an illustration of how easily a perfectly innocent man may be con victed in spite of the socalled legal safeguards how presumably strong identi fications may be errors and how easily the broad experience of the judges court officials attorneys as well as other persons interested in the case may inadvertently err the following cases are cited On March 4 1919 in New York City a plain clothes man by the name of Gunson who later was indicted for a series of offenses arrested on Seventh avenue two perfectly good girls charged upon the testimony of the officer with soliciting Magistrate Mancuso found them guilty and suspended sentence Later Judge Otto A Rosalsky of General Sessions found there was not one scintilla of evidence to warrant the arrests exonerated the girls and discharged them from custody As a result of the finding in the case a deputy district attorney was placed in the night court to see that no woman should be convicted of this offense upon the uncor roborated testimony of an officer In Flesherton Ont a boy named Arnold Love age 21 an industriou3 and respectable farmer attended a revival meeting Arise and confess your sins shouted the Rev G N Sharpe evangelist The boy arose from his chair and confessed to murdering his mother seven years before for which crime his father was hanged on circumstantial evidence In August 1920 William Henry Campbell a negro admitted killing Mrs Gertrude Harrison Mann Among other admissions he confessed to a criminal attack upon Mrs Bertha Sanders of Bethesda Md for which Forrest Eaglin a Maryland negro was then serving time These are only a few illustrations Many more can be cited showing the necessity first of having every person charged with crime represented by an PUBLIC DEFENDER 311312 PUBLIC DEFENDER attorney conscientious skillful energetic and interested in the welfare of the state as well as that of the prisoner and secondly of a thorough investigation by trained investigators whose business it is to trace the truthfulness of all the defendants witnesses in order that the court may be able to render proper judgment At the convention of the American Bar Association in August 1920 Mr Charles E Hughes now Secretary of State made this statement There is no more serious menace than the discontent which is fostered by a belief that one cannot enforce his legal rights because of poverty To spread that notion is to open a broad road to Bolshevism The poor man must have legal advice and except in the simplest matters he needs skilled assistance to present the merits of his case    Without opportunity on the part of the poor to secure such aid it is idle to talk of equality before the law You may provide the machinery of course but to have justice according to law save in a very limited class of cases where a judge may act as advisor you must have the aid of lawyers To assert that the judge looks out for the prisoners rights and sees that he gets a square deal is simply a statement without the slightest foundation in fact The judge is a judge and it is his business to show favor to neither side It is his function to hold the scales evenly Certainly all the judges of Baltimore City as well as those I have had the good fortune of meeting in the counties are men of high character and earnestness and they often go to much additional labor and in some cases unusually painstaking efforts to give the prisoner every opportunity to vindicate himself I am quite certain that were it not for the patience of some of the judges of Baltimore City in giving me every opportunity to work out my clients cases in a number of instances I should never have succeeded in bringing about results where there seemed no chance of changing what appeared the facts of a given case But the judge and juryif there be a jurybase their judgments upon the evidence and if they have not the evidence if they have no means of getting at the truth if the states attorney presents what appears evidence of guilt and if the defendant has no means of controverting these statements how is the defendant to obtain justice He has been locked up with other offenders he is poor very poor maybe and is often ignorant Highclass legal talent and investigations cost money The prisoner is nervous and friendless with hope dead in his breast his relatives if he has any have probably deserted him and last but not least the evidence appears dead against him How can such a man put up a proper defense even if the judge is willing to give him every opportunity  A public defender would be to the person accused of crime what the Legal Aid Association is to those too poor to employ attorneys in small civil cases The public defender would in no way compete with private counsel He would not be used by those in a position to secure paid attorneys The difficulty that would probably have to be overcome by him would be the cases of people who wish to take advantage of him but who are perfectly able to pay for legal services The public defender might require his clients to make affidavit as to poverty and the office would certainly have to have other safeguards such as investigation of financial status as a safeguard against improper use But after 312 PUBLIC DEFENDERPUBLIC DEFENDER 313 all this is a mere detail of arrangement and should not militate against the establishment of a public defenders office The first public defenders office was established in Los Angeles in January 1914 Since then the encouragement which the judges and other officials of Los Angeles have extended to the office has resulted in its establishment in a number of other places and the introduction of bills for the creation of a public defender in perhaps half of the legislatures of the country Quoting from Mr Lyman Abbot The first duty of society to the poor is not to give them charity but to give them justice Will the Maryland Legislature respond Samuel Rubin of the Baltimore Bar in the Baltimore Evening Sun February 3 1922

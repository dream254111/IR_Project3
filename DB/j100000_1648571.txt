upon will be discussed by noted chemists At the symposium on photochemistry and plant physiology to be held Thursday Decem ber 28 at 2 p m H A Spoehr of the Desert Laboratory will discuss Photosynthesis S E Sheppard will speak on Photochemical re actions and a third speaker will present the subject Carbohydrate metabodism The address of the retiring vicepresident and ichairman of Section C will be upon the subject The nuclei of atoms and the general system of isotopes It is expected that one or two of the ses sions will be provided with a program by nearby sections of the

correspondent writes Professor Mosier gradu ated from the University of Illinois in 1893 He then became an assistant in geology in the same institution in which position he served for three years After a period spent in high school teaching he reentered the service of his university in 1902 to take up the work in soil physics a subject which at that time was largely undeveloped Professor Mosier was an unusually inspiring teacher and he has won the love and respect of the hundreds of stu dents who have come under his instruction In his field of invesltigation his interest was broad but some of the problems which engaged his especial attention were the prevention of soil washing on hilly land the effect of cultivation climatological observations and the soil sur vey of Illinois upon all of which topics he made notable published contributions Pro fessor Mosiers chief interest lay perhaps in the soil survey of Illinois he having been in direct charge of the mapping since the begin ning of the survey Under his direction about four fifths of the state have been mapped Thruough his long experience in this connection he acquired an expert knowledge of soil types that made of him a widely recognized authority in soil classifieation UNIVERSITY AND EDUCATIONAL NOTES THE 1600000 financial development pro ject for Dickinson College and Pennington Seminary has been broutght to a

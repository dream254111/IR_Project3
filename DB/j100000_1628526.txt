incidents of his life nor estimate the characteristics of his impressive personality nor enumerate his contributions to physical science We are assembled in this aca demic hall as his friends his pupils his colleagues about to follow his deserted body to the church and there in silence to give thanks for such an example or to utter with his kindred words of faith and hope consecrated by the comfort they have given to the mourners of many climes and of many centuries Before these last rites we pause to think what sort of a man was this whom we so love and honor whom we so lament whose death in one aspect seems so premature in another crowned with the best that earth can give  An address before the officers and students of the Johns Hopkins University assembled before the funeral April 18 1901I Al9N S VOL XIII No 334 Our friend was born with a powerful mind and the older he grew the more powerful it appeared to those who knew him intimately and to those most capable of understanding the problems and the methods which engaged his thoughts Others may have eyes as keen and fingers as facile but his vision and his dexterity were controlled by a brain of extraordinary fineness versatility and strength No body could walk with him hunt with him sail with him talk with him work with him without perceiving his firm grasp his clear aim his concentrated energy his extraordinary powers In early youth his mind was directed to the study of nature not so much to plants and animals as to physical and chemical forces This was the bent of his life It is true that he was fond of music classical music especially Chopins funeral march for exampleand he loved good works of artthe Madonnas of Raphael for example Yet he cared but little for literature having showed in his early days a boyish animosity toward Greek and Latin which he never wholly overcame Aristotle was no authority to him But the mysterious forces of the physical worldgravitation sound light heat electricity and magnet ismwere his constant study The prin ciples of mechanics were to him of funda mental importance and mathematics was subservient to all his investigations In this broad field he was a reader a student an experimenter an inventor a discoverer a philosopher He knew how to ask a dif ficult and farreaching question and he knew how to seek the answer Extraneous considerations were excluded when he saw the point of an inquiry and on that point he concentrated all his powers For example when he began the brilliant series of experiments in spectrography which made him peerless in this domain he saw that the spectrum depended on the ac curacy of the gratings and the gratings on the dividing engine and the dividing en gine on the screwso he began the study of light by devising and making a screw more exact than any screw that has ever been produced by the most accomplished makers of instruments of precision and then he saw that photography must be im proved before he could reveal to the eye of others the intricacy of the solar spectrum His intellectual apparatus was controlled by a powerful will When he was deter mined upon a given course no regard for consequences no apprehension of perils or of difficulties no dread of failure proved a barrier They heightened his zest For tunately his ends were noble and his pro ceedings wise so that rarely if ever did failure disappoint him or weaken his self confidence He would have been a great soldier a great explorer a great lawyer But above his keen perceptions his logic his adaptation of means to ends and his marvelous concentration I must place an other moral qualityone that appeals to every one of us whether we understand his determination of the mechanical equiva lent of heat or the steps by which he ar rived at the value of the ohm This moral quality is the love of truth Of course he was true in all the ordinary relations of life That is the beginning of truth but not the end of it He was also true in all his investigations careful to eliminate errors to avoid preconceptions to shrink from hasty conclusions and inferences to be critical of other investigations to be ac curate exact conscientious to spare no pains to shrink from no efforts to conceal no difficulties in order that the absolute facts might be established so far as this can be done by limited humanity To him science was another word for truthnot all the truth but that amount of truth which the limited powers of man have dis covered He was a follower of Isaac New 802 SCIENCEMAY 24 1901 SCIENCE ton picking up upon the seashore a few pebbles and discerning their lessons At the close of our first decennium two speakers were brought forward to tell re spectively what had been the aims of this University in providing for the study of science and letters These speakers were Professor Gildersleeve and Professor Row land They had no preliminary conference but each brought his discourse to a close by a return to the keynotethe keynote which had governed and should govern our personal behavior and the harmonies of our associated lives as members of the Johns Hopkins University Said the exponent of letters  First and last the scientific standard must be up held for the university man be he a stu dent of letters be he a physicist and that standard is the absolute truth the ultimate truth  Nothing imperfect is the measure of anything says the prince of idealists Said the man of science  But for my self I value in a scientific mind most of all that love of truth that care in its pursuit and that humility of mind which makes the possibility of error always present more than any other quality This is the mind which has built up modern science to its present perfection which has laid one stone upon the other with such care that it to day offers to the world the most complete monument to human reason This is the mind which is destined to govern the world in the future and to solve problems pertaining to politics and humanity as well as to inanimate nature  It is the only mind which appreciates the imperfections of the human reason and is thus careful to guard against them It is the only mind that values the truth as it should be valued and ignores all personal feeling in its pursuit And this is the mind the physical laboratory is built to culti vate These are words worthy to be recalled by the successive groups of students who come here for instruction and counsel as the years roll on Let us sacredly cherish our inheritance In closing let me call our departed brother our dear colleague our honored teacher our ornament our pride and our delight by another nobler title He was a servant of the Lord If one who leads a life of purity fidelity and integrity and who consecrates without selfseeking his strength his talents his time at home and at his laboratory in health and in bodily infirmities in youth and in maturity to the interpretation of the laws by which the cos mos is governed is a servant of the Lord then reverently and truly we may say of our departed friend he was a servant of the Lord Maker of heaven and earth Let me apply to him words of the Master whom he was taught from childhood to revere His eye was single and  his whole body was full of light DANIEL 0 GILMAN JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY AN OUTLINE OF THE PROGRESS OF CHEM ISTRY IN THE NINETEENTHE CENTURY CHEMISTRY is one of the youngest of the natural sciences Its growth and develop ment have taken place almost entirely in the past one hundred years Nevertheless it is well to remember that some of the foundation stones of the science were laid in the latter part of the eighteenth century There was no such thing as a science of chemistry in the time of the ancient Greeks and Romans Nor during the middle ages nor previous to the year 1750 can there be said to have been any systematized chemi cal knowledge In the middle of the eighteenth century the attempt was made to explain in a gen eral way that most striking of all ordinary  Address delivered before the Academy of Science at St Louis on March 18th 803

j100249,The Journal of Religion,1195581,Israel and Egypt,i251286,ISRAEL AND EGYPT This is the work of a busy pastor in Glasgow The amount of labor that has gone into the making of this book is amazing Mr Knight has read almost everything of importance upon the subject and he has reported his reading accurately The care that is shown in the proof reading is typical of the whole work The book is a veritable mine of information upon Egypt and Palestine and will constitute a monument to the diligence of the author The historical value of this book is open to serious question The reviewer will not concern himself with its contribution to the history of Egypt except to point out that Mr Knight takes Petrie as his guide for SNile and Jordan An Archaeological History of the InterRelations between Egypt and Palestine from the Earliest Times to the Fall of Jerusalem in AD 70o G A Frank Knight London James Clarke and Co 1921 xii572 pages 5 maps 36s654 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION the most part and consequently adopts the longer chronology For example he places the beginning of the First Dynasty at 55io BC in contrast to Erman Meyer Breasted et al who put it at about 3500 Bc He follows Hommel in making Egyptian civilization to have originated in Babylonia whence it was brought to Egypt by Semitic invaders who were in turn conquered by the Egyptians to whom however the Semites taught the arts of civilization In the field of Hebrew history there can be no serious difference of judgment on the part of historical students as to the slight value of Mr Knights treatment It is innocent of any knowledge of historical method There is no sharp discrimination in the evaluation of sources The Chronicler ranks high as a credible historian The Targum Josephus Manetho the Apocrypha and the Apostle Stephen all come in for recognition as witnesses to the history of the ancient world and are given much weight as preserving ancient traditions The Song of Songs furnishes facts as to Solomon All is grist to Mr Knights mill The plagues recorded in Exodus actually happened as there related The tabernacle of the Priestly Code was an actual building as described The story of Joseph including the episode with Potiphars wife is liter ally true as told It is refreshing after wandering so long in uncertainty about early Hebrew chronology to turn to Mr Knights table and find that Isaac was born in 2065 BC Abraham died in 1990 BC Moses was born in 1525 Bc the Exodus occurred in 1445 Bc Moses died in 1405 Bc and David was born in 1039 Bc and died in 969 Bc The Pharaoh of the Oppression was Thothmes III and Amenhotep II was the Pharaoh of the Exodus Queen Hatshepset was the daughter of Pharaoh who saved the life of the infant Moses One end that Mr Knight had in view in writing this book was to stress the influence exerted by Egypt upon the life and thought of the Hebrews This is a perfectly proper purpose and is in the main right It is practically certain that the influence of Egypt upon Hebrew life has so far been underestimated But Mr Knight overdoes the matter He sees Egyptian influence where there is no reason to see it For example why must Jobs longing for a record of his words inscribed upon the rock be connected with the rockinscriptions of Egypt  Was not the rock of Behistun known to the Hebrews of that day  The Assuan colony had an Aramaic copy of the Behistun inscription Were there not rockcut inscriptions in Sinai and on the Dog River Again why must Jobs reference to clay under the seal argue for Egyptian influence  Was not the seal well known in Palestine itself to say nothing of the clay tablets and the seals of Babylonia  When Job says OhBOOK REVIEWS 655 that I knew where I might find him that I might come even to his seat must we see an Egyptian background Were gods enthroned only in Egypt The Code of Hammurabi for example represents Shamash the sungod as seated upon his throne delivering the laws to the king Is it to be supposed that contemporary Persian or Greek god were never thought of as sitting down  Need we go abroad at all to account for Yahwehs being thought of as seated upon a throne  Such claims as these weaken an otherwise good case In so far as Mr Knight succeeds in impressing upon his readers the fact that the relations between the life of Egypt and the life of Palestine were continuous and intimate his work will be of service in enlightening the present age re garding the unity of the civilization of the ancient oriental world J M Powis SMITH UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO

Motto Nil desperandimcras iterabinmus acquor Read November x6th a804 THE Ship UTlysses of Salem Massaclhusetts under the com nand of Captain William Mugford sailed from that port ox the 2d day of January 1804 bound to Marseilles On tlhc204 DESCRIPTION OF 5th of that montlh being in Latitude 41 Longitude 65 from the meridian of London she experienced a heavy gale of wind and while running 8 and 9 knots a large sea struck her stern and carried away the rudder at the waters edge when the ves sel immediately broaclhed to The mainmast was sprung and the hull lay exposed to every sea In this unfortunate situation Capt Mugford was reduced to the necessity of steering thie slhip with cables over the quarters for upwards of twenty days making however the best of his way towards the western Is lands aDd Madeira The weather during all this time was ex tremely boisterous and the ship much exposed to the Sea It was during this interval that Capt Mugford planned and executed his temporary rudder This rudder is made of a spare topmast and other spars well lashed and secured togetlher and fastened to a false sternpost by eyebolts serving as braces and crowbars and other substitutes for pintles The false post is also firmly secured to the old sternpost by the guys and old rudder braces which are tennoned into it tiller ropes are fixed to each end of an old iron tiller or for want of it an iron anclhor stock or a piece of scantling or a spar is fixed across the rud der and supported witlh ropebraces so that the vessel is steered iM the usual manner with the wheeland in order to keep tlhis rudder steady in its place while fixing it a cannon or some other sufficient weight is fastened to the bottom of it Capt Mtigford after observing that great difficulty would be avoided in the construction if the master of every vessel was in possession of the measure of the rudder and the precise distance of the gudgeons informs us that he found it to answer every purpose which could be expected from a temporary rudder that his vessel was found to steer by it with the greatest ease and tllat he sailed with it during fifty days at the end of which time lhe arrived in safety at the port of hiis destinationi The drawing of the rudder the following description of it and the remarks subjoined were furnished to the society by Capt William Jones one of their associates from the model of the rudder sent by the Inventor and deposited in the cabinet of the SocietyMUGFORDS TEMPORARY RUDDER 205 MUGFORDS TEMPORARY RUDDER A Plate V Fig 7 Is the main sternpost from which the original rudder has been torn B Is the false sternpost made of a spare topmast sided so as to fit the main sternpost with mortices to receive the braces h h bi or the fragments thereof which remain upon the post C Is the temporary rudder made of the residue of the top mast and the sprit sail yard studding sail booms or any spars that can be spared witlh the least inconvenienceThey are cut to the proper length and partially sided and firmly bolted or treenaiiled together The sides are then flatted a little with the adze and boards nailed across and wooldings of rope bind the wlhole together as represented in the figure D D D D Represent the spars of wlhich the rudder is con structed E Is a small spar or piece of plank fitted on each side of the false post to lead the guys clear and prevent their chafing they are also bolted througli from side to side and rivetted to secure the false post from splitting or if bolts are not to be had lashings are substituted as represenited in the figure F F Are stout flat cleats well nailed or bolted on each side of the false post under the spars E and embrace the main post Their use is to sustain the false post against a lateral shock G Is a yoke made of an iron tiller or other sufficient substi tute firmly fitted through the after part of the rudder near the surface of the water H II H Are the temporary braces and pintlesThey are formed of eye bolts drawn out of the gun carriages or from the various parts of the hull masts or caps and driven into the false post and rudder alternately so that the eyes just meet each other some of those in the post below those in the rudder and others above in order to confine the rudder from risingThe pintles are made of crowbars a kedge anchorstock or the long stout bolts out of the windlass bits h h h Are the old rudder braces or the fragments thereof re maining on the post I Is the profile of the stern of the ship206 DESCRIPTION OF K K Are guys the bites of wlhich are well served and lashed to the after part of the false post and lead separately or combined as represented in the figure to the fore and after parts of the main chiains L L Are knots worked on the guys to preserve them from chafing against the bottom and quarters M Is a rope the bite of which is lashed to the after part of the rudder below the yoke and also to the extremities of the yoke and from thence led through blocks attached to the end of a spar projecting over each quarter to the wheel by whicl the ship is steered N Is a slip rope rove through a hole in the heel of the rud der and both ends passed up through the rudder case to the head of the false post and made fast 0 Is a grommet travelling on the slip rope to which a gun or kedge anclhor or any sufficient weight is attached in or der to sink thie rudder until it is hung and secured P Is a hiauling line attachied to the grommet and by wVhich the weight is lowered down and hauled up When the rudder is secured in its place the weight is removed and the slip rope uinrove Q are the rudder pendents to save the rudder in case of acci dent R Is the lower deck S Is the quarter deck TI Is the quarter rail V The arch board of the Stern REMARKS The merit of this invention is to be tested by a just comparison with the best substitute hitherto known which is undoubtedly that of Capt Pakenhams excellent invention an account and description of which may be found in the 7th volume of the Transactions of the London Society for the encouragement of arIts manufactures and commerce The difference consists in Captain Mugfords new and inge nious contrivance of a false stern post to which his rudder isMUGPORDS TEMPORARY RUDDER 207 secured by eye bolts serving as braces and crowbars or other substitutes as pintles on which it works with as much ease and effect as the original rudder The false post is also firmly se cured to the main post by the guys and the old rudder braces which are tenoned into it Captain Pakenhams rudder depends entirely upon the very slight hold which the cap has on the post and does not appear to be sufficiently secured to resist a sudden lateral shock it is however very simple in its construction and requires perhaps less labor and fewer materials particularly of iron than Capt Mugfords and has the advantage of steering upon deck with a common tiller in the usual way Capt Mugfords rudder must work with much less friction and consequently wvill require less power as the axis on which it moves is only an inch and a half in diameter whereas that of Capt Pakenhams is the diameter of the topmast say 10 or 12 inches Upon the whole as the construction of Capt Mugfordg rudder requires only theskill and materials which are usually to be found on ship board and as it appears to be better secur ed and works with more ease than Capt Pakenhams it may without derogating from the merit of the latter be justly con sidered as a valuable and useful invention Capt Mugfords rudder is susceptible of a very simple and important improvement viz If the archboard of the stern V was cut off and the after part of the rudder case taken down the stock of the rudder might be continued to the upper deck and steer with the tiller in the usual way Capt Mugfords mode of steering is exceptionable as the yoke is at the surface of the water and the wheel ropes leading from the yoke to the spar broad upon the quarter the angle which the rope makes with the yoke when the rudder is hard over is so ob tuse as greatly to diminish the effort of the power and more over the rudder is necessarily so broad at the surface of the wa ter as to expose a dangerous resistance to the action of the sea It is also to be observed that few merchant ships under 350 tons burthen have either wheel or iron tiller If the rudder was continued to the deck the breadth might be diminrished c208 DESCRIPTION OF C at the surface of the water and enlarged at the heel which would increase its effect and render it less liable tCo injury In the drawing the cleats F F are added to the side of the false post and overlapping the main post which will give it great additional security Some minior alterations are also made viz In the drawing the four guys 1 I 1 which are separate in the mnodel are combined into two K K leading through a thimble or clinch the reason is that am ore equal tension can be obtain ed of two ropes than of four and that when combined they lead in a fairer direction under the buttock of the ship Indeed the number of guys are superfluous the lower one would be amply sufficient as thie upper end of the post can be made very secure Captain Pakenham has but a single guy leading from the cap on each side The drawinig represents a mode of applying and removiing the weiglht to sink the rudder by which the whole can be re moved witlh more ease when the rudder is secured When the rudder is fixed the only apprehension is the guys chafing off There is however on board every ship a conmplQte remedy viz Take two of the topmast back stay chain plates aind one of the bolts and bolt them to the heel of the false stern post one on each side to these hook the topblocks and mouse the hooks well thlien reeve the guys through the blocks and take both parts to the fore part of the main chains by this means the guys may be overlhauled through the blocks anid ex anined at pleasure keeping them always well taught and veer ing away one part as you haul in upon the other These re marks are the more diffuse as the subject is considered impor tant and is still susceptible of great improvement Captain Mugford was some days hetore he could hang his rudder owing to bad weather The man will deserve well who shall invent a simple substi tute for a rudder that can be made and applied immediately in any weather and it need not be despaired of if men of ingei nuity without waiting for the calamity would only try expe rirneuts wlhile their ships are in a sound state

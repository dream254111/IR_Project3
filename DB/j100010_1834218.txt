j100010,The American Historical Review,1834218,The Failure of the Humble Petition and Advice,i331968,THE FAILURE OF THE HUMBLE PETITION AND ADVICE1 SINCE a compromise never meets the wishes of any considerable party it must justify itself by its success in securing the objects desired by its supporters If the Humble Petition and Advice actually brought  settlement to the nation even those who were originally discontented with it would soon give in their adhesion On the other hand if it failed in securing this desirable end all these lukewarm supporters would soon be active opponents of the new government In case the Humble Petition and Advice did succeed then the opinion that the cause of civil government had won a considerable victory would be justified It soon became apparent however that success could not yet be claimed but that another trial of strength must be made between the army and the sectaries on the one hand and the staunch upholders of the Humble Petition and Advice on the other All the supporters of kingship could by no means be counted among the adherents of the new government since many of them were irrevocably hostile to any government which did not include monarchy while others probably more numerous still were at the best only lukewarm in support It is true that the compromise had for the time being secured the support of Des borough and Fleetwood But their adherence was of little moment unless they could carry with them a considerable party It is doubtful however if Desborough had any following of importance while Fleetwood could not possibly secure the allegiance of the larger number of the sectaries some of whom already reproached IThis paper forms the concluding portion of an independent study of the last attempts to settle the government under Cromwell The two preceding portions related to the failure of the Instrument of Government and to the Humble Petition and Advice and the attempt to make Cromwell king But while they were receiving their final preparation for the press there appeared successively Mr C HI Firths two articles in the English HYistoiica Reeview XVII 429 July I902 and XVIII 52 January 1903 on Cromwell and the Crown and the first chapter of Mr Gardiners fourth volume These cover so nearly the same ground as the papers described that I do not deem it expedient or useful to print them though a mention of them seems almost necessary toward explaining the existence and the limits of the present paper 36Tlhe Failure of Ilke HunIble Petition and Advice 37 him with beingT recreant to the  Good Old Cause Their sup port therefore could have been of no great moment and they were determined that no further change should take place In this attitude they would be supported by the sectarian party which had always been fostered by Fleetwood and which still exer cised vast influence over the Protector  That gang as Henry Cromwell stigmatized it would certainly hinder settlement Ap parently they feared that kingship had only been deferred espe cially since the Humble Petition and Advice as finally adopted retained the  other house or House of Lords They omitted no opportunity therefore of putting difficulties in the way of further change Many of the soldiers in England thanked Cromwell for his refusal of the title and attempts were made to secure from some of the Irish officers similar congratulations apparently with out Henry Cromwells knowledge though perhaps with that of Fleetwood who was still lord deputy2 The irreconcilability of interests is vividly portrayed in a letter of Richard Cromwells to his brother Your owne affaires in the entring into them he wrote  gave you some sight of persons whose designe hath been for a long time layd to take roote for the hindring

these circumstances it was allimportant that the new set tlement should be as little defective and objectionable as possible Otherwise no considerable party would rally to its support Ex arnination of the Humble Petition and Advice however shows that it was defective in several particulars and contained clauses which were certain to provoke bitter opposition from the sectaries The most significant of these clauses were those concerning re ligion The makers of the new constitution were evidently deter mined to erect a state church in England and were indeed as much bent upon establishing a church as upon establishing a king The whole instrument is redolent with this design The gist of the plan however is contained in the tenth eleventh and twelfth articles The tenth article voiced the desire of the House that the revilers of godly nministers or their assemblies and the disturbers of public worship be punished according to law and that where the laws were defective the Protector should assent to such laws as shall be made in that behalf Article I 2 ratified all the acts passed by the Long Parliament abolishing the episcopal system and so made impossible any return to that establishment To these articles little objection could be made by any of the Puritan factions The eleventh article however was of a far different character It de clared first that the Protestant religion alone should  be held forth and asserted for the public profession of these nations Then fol lowed what was the kernel of the whole religious plan of the Peti tion that a Confession of Faith should be agreed upon by Cromwell and the Parliament This confession was to  be asserted held forth and recommended to the people of these nations and no one was to be suffered in speech or writing  maliciously or con temptuously to assail it The article then made a general provi sion for religious toleration excluding from this  liberty however all Roman Catholics Episcopalians and Unitarians all who denied the inspiration of the Holy Scriptures and all such as publish horrible blasphemies or practice or hold forth licentiousness or pro faneness under the profession of Christ Provided a minister did not fall in any of these categories he might differ in matters of worship and discipline but he must assent to the Confession of Faith if he was to  be capable of receiving the public maintenance appointed for the ministry This article therefore not only de nied toleration to a considerable number of persons who had hitn erto possessed it such as Quakers Ranters and Fifth Monarchists 1 See for instance Article 4 with its qualifications for members of Parliament and its revival of the act of August 9 I650 against several atheistical blasphemous and exe crable opinions derogatory to the honour of God and destructive to human societyThe Failture of tle Hum ble Peiti on anzd Adzvice 39 but it pronounced those who did not assent to the public confession incapable of receiving public maintenance The tithes and the ecclesiastical property of the state were to be devoted to a body of men holding a certain set of religious tenets It is impossible to state definitely what these tenets were to be but there can be little doubt that if Parliament had had its way the new establishment would have been a modified form of Presbyterianism Oliver would presumably oppose a Presbyterian system yet it is conceiv able that in time he would have consented to this and certainly to accept Presbyterianism could not have been more difficult than to accept kingship Indeed it is plain that now the two stood to gether for the intense opposition of the sectaries in itself made any other combination impossible Cromwell warmly approved of the Petitions provisions regarding religion and could not have been blind to their drift Even supposing that a Presbyterian system could not be established while Oliver lived this would certainly have come after his death for his sons had little sympathy with the sectaries Henry Cromwell in outlining to Thurloe those provisions in the Humble Petition and Advice that seemed to him most im portant laid stress upon the religious plan approving warmly the  holdeing forth a publique confession of faith the expectation of these nations injoyning the acknowledgment of the sacraments prayer magistracy and ministry to be ordinances of God and all this with due respect to tender consciences 2 Parliaments purposes in regard to religion are clearly evidenced by several other events Speaker Widdrington in presenting the Humble Petition and Advice to the Protector expressed clearly and frankly the object in view There are two extremities in state concerning the causes of faith and religion that is to say the permission of the exercise of more religions than one which is a dangerous indulgence and toleration and is not introduced by this government    The other is the entering and sift ing into mens consciences when no overt scandal is given    and which is desired to be provided against in this Frame3 This view must have been sufficiently alarming to the extreme sectaries yet that it correctly defined the position of Parliament is plain fronm the subsequent action of the House Thus an act  for the better observation of the Lords Day comnpelled attendance at church under penalty of the forfeiture of two shillings six pence for nonattendance4 This act was precisely similar to the acts under 1 April 21 I657 Stainer Speeches of Oliver Cromwell 33I 2 H Cromwell to Thurloe April 8 I657 Thurloe VI I83 3

still was the passage of a bill for catechizing It is impossible to say what this bill contained but it was opposed by the more liberal and tolerant members of Parlia ment2 That it was an essentially antiIndependent bill can be inferred with certainty not only from this opposition but also from Cromwells position towards it and fiom the feeling his course aroused It was the only bill that he vetoed and this act bitterly incensed its supporters3 The feeling of the sectaries in regard to the new religious settle ment was clearly expressed in the Narrative of thze Late Parliamient wherein the author caustically criticizes the settlement and as a proof of the designs of the Parliament points to the bill for cate chizing4 It is not surprising that these various alarming events convinced the sectaries that a movement was being made to suppress them and that Oliver was party to it Many of them had been convinced of this as early as August 1655 a conviction expressed in a wellknown pamphlet directed against the Protectori Libel ous as this pamphlet was in so far as Cromwells intentions were conicerned it was nevertheless a truthful statement of the direction that events were bound to take The realization of their fears by the passage of the Humble Petition and Advice this attempt to establish a national church and to shut out from the benefits of public maintenance all ministers who did not conform to its Con fession of Faith explains and justifies the oppositioin of the sectaries not only to the project of kingship but to the whole constitution 6 That the Humble Petition and Advice was left imperfect in many particulars might be inferred from the speed with which it was made and from the necessity of compromising the differences be I Commons Journals VII 537

water Burton II 373The Failure of lize lunzible Peiion anid Advice 41 tween parties with regard to it The imperfection of the constitu tion was made irretrievable by the alteration of the title from kiing to protector Incomplete and imperfect as the Petition might be the acceptance of the office and title of king would have carried with it so many consequences would have reestablished so many old legal institutions that all defects would probably have been surmounted But the lawyers were certainly correct in arguing that the laws could not be administered without the kingly office They were correct because the mere conviction on their part was sufficient to make it impossible to administer the laws without the office Further more the protectoral office since it had been conferred without a specific definition of its powers left matters still unsettled More over since the proposal to grant to the protector precisely the same prerogatives as those inhering in the royal title had been rejected only one conclusion could be drawn namely that the powers of the protector were not those of the king What they were no man could tell The consequences would be confusion in the interpre tation of the law contradictory decisions by the courts and endless and hopeless endeavors to fit the new executive to the old institutions The failure to establish the kingship was of vast consequence in respect to the succession The Petition permitted Cromwell to nominate his own successor but rnade Ino provision for his suc cessors successor Had he been king the law would have deter mined all doubts As things actually stood the succession was left in almost as indefinite a condition as before the adoption of the new constitution More important still was the position assigned to the  other house in the new scheme2 The judicial functions of the new house were defined in precise general terms but its legislative func tions were not As matters stood this was a prime defect When Parliament framed the Petition it had expected to have a king in which case the legislative status of the new house would have been ipso facto determined As a House of Lords its legislative functions would have been precisely those of the old House of Peers Under I For the speed with which the Humble Petition and Advice was made see Packer February 9 I6589 Burton III 6i6 Baynes February II I6589 ibidI 2I6 Article I5 with the title of king in it was omitted from the printed text no effort being made to supply the omission so that in all prinited copies the bewildered readler passes directly from the fourteenth to the sixteenth article Lenthall on Junle 23 I657 asserted that the IPetition and Advice was  very imperfect yet  and that he regarded it as being merely ani  embryo Ibidi II 280 2 In the original Humble Petition anid Advice the nomiiinatiolns of members of the other house  were to be approved by the House of Commons The Humble Additionlal Explaniatory IPetition and Advice however left the nominiations wholly in the hands of the protector42 R C H Calerall a protectorate this was certainly not selfevident That the  other house was in fact inconsistent with this title of protector was so clear that during the debates after Cromwells refusal of kingship it was taken for granted the proposal being made to give up the house as a matter of course if the title protector was adopted That this motion was not carried shows pretty clearly that kingship was not abandoned That the advocates of monarchical govern ment insisted on retaining the  other house  without further defi nition of its status its authority and its powers is equally good evi dence of the purpose to hold to their course If they had been willing permanently to surrender their wishes the position of the new house could have been settled in the sense agreeable to the opposing party without much difficulty Unless however the pro ject for kingship was completely surrendered it was impossible to define further the functions and powers of the  other house   for if this had been attempted the partizans of a commonwealth would have  ravelled into  the entire frame of government to some pur pose in all probability with consequences disastrous to the plan2 The  other house just as it existed was an inevitable result of Cromwells declining the kingship and in forcing this upon him the army leaders won a great victory  How have they wrote an angry Oliverian  forced him as Aaron to make a Calfe like the iEgyptian Ox an other House instead of a House of Peers   3 The victory consisted in erecting an institution which was not viable as it existed which must be altered which must lead either to a kingly settlement or to the undoing of what had already been ac complished towards such a settlement It was not by chance therefore that the attack of the opposition in the second session was directed against the  other house The vulnerable part of the new settlement lay there and there also lay the most serious menace to the advocates of military rule of sectarianism of the Commonwealth How differently the various parties regarded the status of the new house is shown by all the available evidence From the first the monarchists hesitated to admit that they were attempting to create a House of Lords On the contrary they assured opponents Whether  such thinges  in the Petition  as may be therein conceived inconsistent with this title may not be expunged as House of Lords and such like News letter May I5 I657 Clarke Papers III io8 2 See on this difficulty Goodwins motion June

in order to preserve liberty of conscience There was to be no restoration of the old Lords1 It was even argued that the new house would be a bar to the restoration of the old one2 The supporters of another house asserted too that it was necessary to have a second house with judicial power since it was doubtful if the House of Commons possessed such power and since even if it did too much time would be consumed in con sidering complaints from Courts of Justice and Equity3 The  great reason  alleged however was  that Bills passed too hastily  in a single house and without sufficient discussion4 It is evident that the royalists did not dare openly to champion a House of Lords Even as it was they found much difficulty in securing the assent of their opponents to the establishment of a new house At last however the latter yielded to the arguments adduced coupled with the assurance that there was no intention of restoring the old peers They were willing to have a second house provided only it was not a House of Lords Neville one of the Commonwealth leaders argued indeed in favor of a second house with this limitation 6 and the army after the dissolution of the Rump while declaring against a restoration of the peers favored the erec tion of a senate to keep the Commons within bounds The argument against a House of Lords was perfectly intelli gible and extremely simple if a House of Lords was established the old nobility would inevitably be admitted and if the old nobility were admitted the restoration of the Stuarts was certain8 The Petition failed also to define the manner in which nomina tions were to be made to the new house after Olivers death The grant of power to nominate members was to Oliver alone without mention of his heirs and successors It could be argued therefore that future protectors had no authority to nominate members Had 1  Never was any thing brought in with more sugarsweet and plausible words It shall be a check upon restraint of

prerogatives vest without interruption in his successor In other words the king never dies Another shortcoming of the Humble Petition and Advice was the failure to provide for the distribution of members of the lower house The plan of reformed constituencies embodied in the Instrument of Government perished with the Instrument It was probably unsatisfactory to the members or they would have adopted it in the new constitution as it stood The question of a new re formed distribution was discussed on May 27 I657 but the House got no further than to pass a resolution that the subject should be finally debated in one week from that date But the predetermined day was later set apart as a day of thanksgiving for Blakes victory at Vera Cruz and the discussion concerning distribution was never resumed As a consequence the old unreformed constituencies revived2 Not only so but the failure to determine the distribution of seats left the new constitution without a specific provision for electing members to Parliament from Scotland and Ireland3 The question arises too whether Cromwell was really possessed of a veto under the new protectorate He certainly believed that he was for on one occasion he exercised a veto Yet one may well doubt that the Petition and Advice granted this prerogative and in Richards Parliament the privilege was hotly questioned If Cromwell had become king the veto would have been his as part of the royal prerogative but a protector as protector had no such prerogative and the Humble Petition and Advice did not specifically confer it upon him In short although the new constitution was an advance along the line which government in England was bound to take though it restored the rights of the people and the privileges of Parliament though it increased the powers of the houses and diminished those of the executive it was astonishingly imperfect and could not pos sibly be a final settlement Under the circumstances it was of the utmost importance that the new government should be intrusted to those who desired its success The principal opponents of kingship with the exception Iij2 138 139 2 That Cromwell believed the old system to be reestablished may be inferred from the fact that in granting a charter to Swansea May 3 I658 he constituted it a parlia mentary borough Dictiontay of Natioizal Biograiph XXX 152 article Philip Jonles  3Clarges to H Cromwell June 22 i658 Thurloe VII I93 See also in Burton the discussion over this poinit in Richard Cromwells ParliamentThze Failure of the Humible Peition and Advice 45 of Fleetwood Desborough and a few others could certainly not be counted among this number Changes in the form of government as Henry Cromwell sagaciously pointed out were of no avail so long as the same men remained in power He therefore strongly advocated the purging of the council and the army In other words he wished the government to be intrusted to those whom he called the honest party  The Protector however had evidently resolved upon a com promise government and was not inclined to purge either council or army The only new councilors created were Thurloe who received the dignity on July I3 i6572 and the Protectors eldest son Richard who was made councilor at the request of the council in December of the same year3 But the opposition of one man had been so venomous anid in the opinion of all so clearly factious and selfseeking that he could not overlook it The offender was John Lambert and over him came the first struggle of parties in the new government Lambert was throughout supported by Sydenham another influential member of the council and neither of the mal contents came near Whitehall for weeks after the final decision4 Some believed that Lambert would either surrender his commission or have it taken from him Thurloe was confident that he would not surrender it and believed there would be serious danger in per mitting him to retain his power Others however presumably Fleetwood and Desborough were of a different opinion5 Henry Cromwell agreed with Thurloe I take notice of your opinion concerning Lambert  he wrote  I hope H H is sufficiently cautioned concerning hime and I wish those who think his con tinueance in power safe doe not first feele the smarte of it 6 Lambert himself apparently began to suspect that he had over stepped the limits of his power  My Lord Lambert lookes but sadly wrote Russell  He puts me in mind of a saying of old Solomons that there is an appointed time for all things under the sun to hate as well as to love to be sad as well as merry 7 On July I3 the council was to be sworn and Cromwell had already laid commands upon Lambert probably to absent himself I doubt not wrote Fleetwood on the fourteenth yu

his oath that is paused upon He is now retired in appear ance Most of the officers of the army and those most suspected shew r4ther satisfaction then otherwise 3 Lamberts offer was not accepted The dismissal caused an immense sensation and convinced nmen that Oliver meant to be master and probably monarch All men expected wrote Baillie  that when so easily Lambert was quashed the next session of Parliament would have quickly made Cromwell king  The act however remained an isolated one Cromwell making no attempt to root out Lamberts adherents His monarchist followers however could not adopt a similar philosophical attitude and it cannot be doubted that they still worked silently towards the wishedfor goal  The little secretary  nmight in the bitter moment of defeat avow his enduring faith in the considerableness of simplicity but he could not help pursuing the game and he urged members to come up to the next session and complete the work John Ashe wrote that he would strive to be

public life for the good of the cause That he was initent upon attempting once more to make Oliver king may be inferred with certainty from a letter of Henry Cromwells to him written in February i6582 The success or failure of such plans to establish monarchy would depend very largely upon the composition of the new house If its members were monarchists if they were men having the confidence of the nation if they were to a considerable extent members of the old peerage then the object aimed at by Broghill and his adherents might be attained If on the contrary the new house was consti tuted for the most part of army men and antimonarchists then the difficulty of creating a king would be immensely enhanced But the importance of the new house did not cease here Upon its success one may confidently assert depended the success or failure of the new government The vital importance of this question escaped no one and the subject was discussed in all its phases Despite the fact that the Humble Petition and Advice created the new dignities only for life there were not wanting those who held that the new lordships wvould be hereditary The writs to be issued would certainly create the recipients lords asserted the supporters of monarchy Philip Jones writing to Montague informed him that his  writt of the 20th of January  made him a Baron as the learned lawers say    but sure our Petetion and Advice makes it but for life3 On the other side it was said by those not so near to the springs of information that the judges had declared that no legal writ creating barons could be

remain silent busied himself with a new edition of his treatise A Plea for thze Lords azd House of Peers wherein he argued that all the old nobility had an undoubted right to sit in Parliament and that all the judicial powers of Parliament were vested in the king and the House of Lords In this state of affairs it was of prime importance that the men who were to compose the new house should be selected with the utmost skill and wisdom The task of selection however was no small one the difficulty proving  great between those who are fitt and not willinge to serve and those who are willinge and expect it and are not fitt 2 iI doubt wrote Montague with gloomy fore bodings  divers whom I could and I beleeve yr LoPP also vish were of it will not middle and noe doubt divers others will readily supply theire places I heartily wish it otherwise 3 Undoubtedly Montagues chief doubts were in relation to the old nobility and here he was justified It is conceivable that the peers summoned would have been willing to sit had the summons come from a king It can hardly be doubted too that many more of them would have been summoned if Oliver had been king instead of protector As it was the old peers even those friendly to Cromwell would not answer his summons4 Even the Scotch lords would not sit Only Warriston and Lockhart represented Scotland  Cassilis disdained it 1 5As might be expected those men who had most strongly supported the new kingship were also unwilling to take part For instance Pierrepoint and St John were nominated but did not sit Under these circumstainces Oliver did the best he could He was of course bound to compromise and consequently selected men of all parties Had he been bent upon becoming king this would hardly have happened The choice of Hazelrigg seems al most ludicrous  the selection of Pride and a score of the keenest opponents of the kingship must have seemed folly to men like Thurloe Oliver it is true consulted representatives of

time enough your lordship might have been carpenter of a better house 5 When finally the selection was made Thurloe was so exasperated that he apparently neg lected of set purpose to send the list to Henry Cromwell6 His in dignation was undoubtedly occasioned by the conviction that the new house would prove itself an insurmountable obstacle to the erection of a monarchy Most people felt that if the old lords honored the new house by their presence it would be enormously strengthened and might succeed Their attitude therefore was scrutinized closely by all parties  Some say the lords Warwick

themselves They would not recognize the new house as a House of Peers and laid particular emphasis upon the fact that the old nobility did not appear there0 The new government was therefore foredoomed to failure and this failure was made absolutely certain and irretrievable by the composition of the House of Commons The Cromwellians there weakened by the transfer of many of their ablest men to the

strength to resist the attacks of their opponents Cromwell foresaw none of the difficulties and opened the second session of his Parliament in good spirits being perhaps the one man who had complete confidence in the new frame of government  We hope we may say he exclaimed  we have arrived at what is much beyond our expectations The Petition and Advice had restored to the nation both its civil and its religious liberties and for that he was sure they had  all cause to bless God  By impli cation he avowed the new house to be a house of peers addressing the assembled houses as  my Lords and Gentlemen of the House of Commons and speaking of the protest of the bishops against laws  made by this House and the House of Commons 2 He urged them in conclusion to be  the repairers of breaches and the restorers of paths to dwell in 3 The opposition in the House of Commons however was not anxious to repair breaches On the contrary it assaulted the Humble Petition and Advice by refusing to acknowledge the other house as a House of Lords Day after day the question of the powers of the  other house  was debated and i confusion worse confounded  held sway On January 25 Cromwell appealed to the houses to go forward in the important work which lay before them solemnly asserting  I conceive the wellbeing yea the being of these nations is now at stake He then pointed out the polit ical situation and its dangers at home and abroad attempting espe cially to arouse feeling for the condition of Protestants on the coIn tinent Concluding this head he spoke strongly and with a direct appeal concerning the religious and political divisions at home urg ing the houses  to uphold this settlement which I have no cause to think but you are agreed to and that you like it Over and over again in the most solemn language he adjured them to pre serve peace and amity We have peace and the Gospel Let us have one heart and soul one mind to maintain the honest and just rights of this nation    I beseech you and charge you in the name and presence of God and as before him be sensible of these things and lay them to heart    If God shall not unite your hearts and bless you and give you the bless ing of union and love one to another and tread down everything that riseth up in your hearts or tendeth to deceive your own souls with pre tences of this and that thing that we speak of

set all in confusion and they were at this very moment immensely strengthened by the accession of Lambert and Hazelrigg These two appeared in the House for the first time on January 251 and Hazelrigg immediately took the leadership of the republican party On the other hand Oliver seemed determined to have the  other house  recognized as a House of Lords Neither side would yield in the slightest degree Olivers insistence apparently precipitated the crisis On January 28 in answer to a committee of the House of Commons which requested directions concerning the printing of his speech of the twentyfifth he refused bluntly to give such direc tions on the ground that such action might be a breach of the privileges of the other house He gave the committee distinctly to understand that the other house must be recognized as a House of Lords if he and Parliament were to agree2 After this compromise was impossible Despite the hopelessness of the situation the effort to make Cromwell king was resumed On January 28 Major Beake and Colonel Shapcott moved to debate the title of Protector and the status of the other house3 On February 2 Sir John Trevor moved a return to the old constitution with kings lords4 and commons On the following day Mr Gewen moved that kingship should be reestablished5 and was supported by Colonel Cox6 There was no heart however in this renewal of the old attempt The leaders of the monarchists remained silent and indeed it was perfectly plain that for the present nothing of the sort could succeed In short the situation was absolutely desperate  I am amazed at proceedings wrote Henry Cromwell  and have a kind of dread in considering them I On the same day he appealed to Fleetwood  to incline to what is rational and consistent     to seek the

Parlia ment praying for the restoration of the Commonwealth The principal points aimed at were i to secure to the people the constant succession of Free Parliaments duely chosen and 2 to secure the  unquestioned Supreme Power to the said Parliaments 2 This petition was openly circulated some fifty copies being printed for the purpose and it was signed by many thousands of people in and about London3 The leading actor in its promulgation was apparently John Weaver a noted Commonwealthsman who with several of his party  made it their buissinesse to perswade to a com monwealth and were confident that they should carry it and the petition    was to be the first occasion for the debate of it in the house and a cheife man of them useinge arguments to another very considerable person to engage with them for the old parlament and beinge answered that it was impossible because the army was against it he replyed that he would take it upon him that the army would declare for it and that he knew they had beene tryed in 1  About which time also a Petition was preparing by some faithfull Friends to the good old Cause in and about the City of London which was afterward printed and signed with many thousand Hands which Petition makes Mention of the severall Par ticulars that were the Grounds of Contest between the late King and Parliament and the good people of the Nation And prayeth  The Settling those good Things fought for as the Reward and Fruit of the Blood and Treasure so greatly expended in the late Wars etc This Petition was ready to be presented to the Parliament in a

Petitioners did not carry on their businesse in a secret underhand way but openily    and the Petition being framed and agreed unto    about 50 copies were printed and dispersed in order to Subscription and in a few dayes notwithstanding many frowns from Grandees and a numerous Army then quartered in and about the Citty to the terrour of very many it was signed by many thousands and ready to have been presented by a few under a score in the name of the rest Ibid The similarity of the language here and in the Second Narrative where this matter is treated would lead to the supposition that either the writers were the same or the author of the NIarrative had this pamphlet before him when he wroteThze Failure of the Humble Petition and Advice 53 it According to Bordeaux the petition was largely the result of the bitter opposition of the sectarian clergymen who  excited  the Commonwealthsmen to present the petition and  spake high and openly against the government of his highness 2 That the move ment was widespread may be safely asserted The commander of the garrison at Hull wrote Cromwell that his opponents there  were very high before the desolution of Parliament haveing un doubtedly a dangerous designe in agitation 3 No movement so serious for Cromwells regime had hitherto been started The Cavaliers Fifth Monarchy Men and the Com monwealthsmen had opposed him persistently and bitterly but without securing much support The attempt to erect a kingship however had consolidated the Commonwealth party had driven many men hitherto friendly to Oliver into its ranks and for a moment had united all opponents excepting only the Cavaliers The boldness of the petition for the overthrow of the government went far beyond anything hitherto conceived yet undoubtedly the petition itself was the direct result of the officers petition of May I657 If the army could petition unrebuked for a certain form of government why might not the supporters of a commonwealth do likewise  The immediate result was the dissolution of Parliament4 Crom well to the surprise of everyone in a rage summoned the two houses and arraigned the Commons in a speech which revealed the bitterness of his soul and his conviction that the new settlement had fallen in ruins  I looked he said  that the same men that had made that frame would have made it good to me when I came to act your Petition and Advice Otherwise he would have pre ferred to live  under a woodside to have kept a flock of sheep rather than to have undertaken such a place as this was But he had taken it only because he had expected settlement and  the safety of the nations as was well known to  all that did advise and petition    and I am failed in these terms They had refused to Thurloe to H

some tribune of the people might be the man that might rule all This hath been the business really I am sorry to say it but I think the meanest people that go about the streets take notice of it This

Army to seduce them and almost the greatest confidence hath been in the Army to break us and divide us    There were endeavors too  from some not far from this place to stir up the people of this town into tumultings what if I said rebellion    Yea and to draw the Army to the state of a question a Commonwealth a Common wealth These things being so  I do declare to you here that I do dissolve this Parliament Let God judge between you and me So ended in complete failure the attempt to settle the govern ment under the Humble Petition and Advice That it was failure was everywhere recognized The writer of the Second Narrative jubilantly asserted that had Parliament continued to sit it might have Iovervoted the Lovers of Freedom and so have perfected their In strument of Bondage and rivetted it on the Necks of the good People for ever by a Law and thereby made them Vassals and Slaves perpetually But hitherto the Lord hath in a great meas ure frustrated their wicked Designs blessed be his holy name 2 The part which the failure to define clearly the status and func tions of the i other house had played in this unexpected outcome was obvious to all Josias Berners writing to his cousin John Hobart a steady and thorough supporter of the kingship upbraided the monarchists for their neglect It was a wonder he asserted that wise men should have spent so much time upon a title a mat ter

vanity of Messages and Messengers duLr ing the last fortnights sitting would free them forever from half hearted expedients which could never provide settlement2 Un doubtedly the criticism was to the point but nevertheless the monarchists were not to be upbraided with neglect for as has already been pointed out they had done the best that they could Their blamelessness however could not save the situation The  other house  could hardly hope to recover from its colossal failure totally disowned as it had been by almost everyone con cerned3 There were many conjectures as to what Oliver would do next but the prevailing opinion seems to have been that he would call a  great council which should  manage the affairs of the nation 4 It is quite possible that this expedient was suggested Before any thing final could be done however the government had to be cer tain that its existence was for the present assured Olivers first step therefore was to appeal to the army and to the city for sup port On February 6 he addressed the officers at Whitehall urging those who could not in conscience conform to the now govern ment to speak out and expressing the hope that they would still be able to go along together as in the past The officers declared themselves satisfied and promised their support5 So too the city officials when appealed to renewed their pledges of fidelity and 1 Josias

them2 In this they assured Cromwell that  notwithstanding the base Calumnies and Lies    dispersed throughout the whole Nation to the effect that the army was divided and disaffected to the Protector they remainedc firmly united one to another and all of us to your Highnesse as our Generall anid Chief Magistrate They made it their earnest and humble request that he would continue the work of settlement until they had attained  the great ends of all our former engagements our civill and spirituall liberty These ends they were confident were already in a good measure well provided for by The Humlble Petition and atdvize They did freely and heartily engage to support the Protector with their lives in the  further prosecutioin of the great work  upon which he was engaged3 It is plain from the contents of this petition and from the signatures attached to it that Cromwell had nothing to fear from his army and this was Thurloes conviction even before the address was presented4 Equally reassuring were the addresses from the armies in Scotland and Ireland The Irish army in fact went even further than the English in their pledges of allegiance to the Protector in his government Nevertheless the army was far from being satisfied throughout Major Lowe in Ireland for instance refused to sign the address of 1rThurloe to H Cromwell March i6 I6578 Thurloe VIl 4 A

seemed to him clearly to urge kingly government The officers of Cromwells own regi ment all Anabaptists were most recalcitrant and declared them selves not  free  to subscribe fully to the address of the English army Cromwell reasoned with them and finding them to assert steadfastly that they would adhere to  the good old cause re quested them to define that scause and to mention  one par ticular wherein he had departed from it at the same time telling them what he thought the cause was Despite repeated requests for clearer declarations however the officers would not attempt any such definition Only it was plain that the present government did not square with their conception of the good old cause The real difficulty Colonel Packer afterwards declared was their unwillingness to acknowledge the  other house   they could not say that was a House of Lords 2 Failing to get satisfaction from them Cromwell dismissed the six principal officers of the regiment 3 and having thus made a beginning he continued to cashier ill affected officers All those  through the nation  who were abettors of a late petition  for the Commonwealth were ousted4  Many in the army says Baillie both in Scotland and England are cast out  Clearly Oliver intended that no backward step should be taken While the Protectorate stood allegiance must be given to it as well in the army as out of it Not less obvious is it that all this cashiering tended to encourage the civilgovern ment party and renew the hope that Cromwell would be king Kingship was probably now the only solution for the difficulties which beset the government and it was generally expected A new Parliament it was said would be called but a Parlianment in cluding the old lords and the Commons elected by the old con stituencies6

elections to the Commons would prevail since the Humble Petition and Advice had not adopted the reformed plan embodied in the Instrument In any case Cromwell intended to have a new Parlia ment as soon as possible The question of calling a new Parliament came up immediately after the dissolution of the old one Broghill wrote Henry Crom well in February that another Parliament was in contemplation On February 23 Fleetwood wrote that Cromwells illness was the reason for doing nothing at present2 On March 2 he again wrote that the question of settlement was being discussed and that in his opinion they would  suddenly have a parliament The question had been debated thoroughly All wayes had great difficultyes in them but this the least though full of intricacyes 3 It is plain that Fleetwood favored a Parliament but that others in the council strongly opposed it Indeed the question was so far from being settled at this time that Fleetwood added a postscript to his letter saying that since the wrighting of the former lines  it had become doubtful which way they would take In brief the struggle be tween monarchists and antimonarchists still went on The anti monarchists were opposed to having a Parliament and wished to raise means for carrying on the government by laying an extra ordinary tax upon the Cavaliers4 Unquestionably Desborough was the leader of this faction5 though he was certainly not sup ported by Fleetwood6 Until March 30 the discussion according to Thurloe was tossed up and downe amongst comitees of severall sorts  and then had  at last come to the councell The exact positioIn of parties is well described by him They inclyne to a parlament if they can agree what to aske the parlament and what to submitt to that shall be done by them and his highnes Thurloe would give no opinion because I see what some persons enclyne to and what they thinke of a parlament and of such a way of settlement as a parlament if wellminded may bringe forth I Two weeks later he wrote in a similar strain There could be no doubt that a Parliament would be decided upon immediately but 1 J I am glad there is any hopes of another parliament H Cromwell to Broghill February 24

those feares still prevayle and soe disappoint a settlement that then a parliament will ruin us1 Here in a sentence he revealed the entire situation It was kingship or ruin from the point of view of Thurloe and Broghill it was kingship and ruin from the point of view of Desborough and Sydenham Hence the calling of a Parliament was not to be rashly adventured Some agreement between the pros and cons must first be attained Significant how ever is the readiness of Cromwell and his royalist supporters to summon a new Parliament for it showed clearly their confidence that such a body would be with them and that public opinion sup ported the proposal of kingship2 It is evident that the opponents of kingship feared that a Parliament would make Cromwell king and were determined to obstruct by every means in their power the calling of a Parliament Not only so but they were bent on suppressing the monarchists as far as possible They wished to exclude Montague from the council and to hinder Fauconberg from receiving a commission in the army3 In these circumstances the only policy for the royalists was precisely similar namely that of purging the army and council of their opponents Henry Cromwell and undoubtedly Broghill were anxious to have this policy carried through The former wrote The calling of a parliament signifys nothing untill the army be sufficiently modelled for that being full of its humours makes the honest party timorous and the other insolent in their respective proposalls  o I say the wellframing of the army would insensibly temper and keep steady the parliament which no doubt would provide well enough for a councill The policy of those who would keep out honest Montagu etc is not to be disallowed I must say I commend them for their witt but think withall that the overballancing of these politicians themselves is to be endeavoured    We have ebbed and flowed long enough already Tis now time as your lordship says that affairs should run one way or other in a quick current and if God so please to settle ment The intimacy you mention of Fleetwood and Disbrowe with Lambert I do not like  for when such as they dare correspond with such as hee it argues their power to be greater than one would wish though I 1 Thurloe to H Cromwell April 27 I658 ibizi 99 2 This confidence in Parliament is worth noting It has often been said that Cromwell failed utterly with his Parliaments and could not get along with any This was evidently not the opinion of Broghill Thurloe or Henry Cromwell As the Parliament of x656 had been more favorable to Oliver than that of I654 sO the next would probably be more favorable still Much of this confidence was perhaps based on the fact that the next Parliament would be elected on the old basis The result was seen in Richards Parliament 3 H Cromwell to Broghill March IO I6578 Thurloe VI 8586o R C H Calerali hope no greater then of all the rationall and interessed men of the 3 nations who I am confident will not comply with their designs 1 The army was the instrument which needed mending first of all and that must be done by the Protector As already seen Oliver had proceeded to some extent in that direction though Henry Cromwell wished a much more thorough purging Next in importance was the reform of the council but if the army was once put on a proper footing no doubt Parliament would rectify aught that was amiss in the council The antimonarchical members should be ejected and monarchists taken in Montague Broghill Pierrepoint St John these Henry would have taken in Syden ham Desborough Fleetwood these Henry would have cast out Meanwhile Lambert was again becominig a factor in politics and Fleetwood and Desborough were coquetting with him Action immediate and decisive was necessary No more compromises We have ebbed and flowed long enough already The discussion over the calling of a Parliament was continued through the first half of April and was participated in by a council of the army2 By April 20 the civilgovernment party had so far overcome their opponents that the calling of a Parliament had been resolved upon though the date of its summons and the nature of the business to be laid before it were still undetermined3 The struggle between the contending factions was to be waged about this latter subject or in other words over the proposal to allow Par liament to proceed to any settlement it pleased Such a settlement would probably mean kingly government This was the general opinion and it must be obvious that the failure of the last Parliament had strengthened the determination of the monarchists to make Cromwell king As early as February 24 Henry Cromwell wrote to Broghill  I trust his highness will bring the army to such a state as that there may be no danger of them whilst his friends in parliament are hammering out our settlement Further letters of Henrys written in April and Mav leave no doubt that he and Broghill were still of the opinioni that

Henry peti tioned that the Protector should go on to make  a thorough settle ment of these our enjoyments and that upon such a Basis as may be most firm in itself and most suitable to the constitution of these nations 2 The last phrase obviously pointed to kingship as the desirable basis In Baillies opinion the addresses of the armies in both Scotland and England also encouraged  the Protector to pro ceed and it was thought he added that on the councells act and armies petition the Crown shall be put on Sundry shyres were also said to be forming petitions to his Highness to accept of the title of King3 Without doubt many of those who signed the army petitions must have done so in the expectation that king ship would be the outcome As to the shires certain petitions did appear in July and August asking for settlement with an evident reference to kingship as the government  most natural and accept able to the nation 4 The need of settlement  a settlement that would compel the obedience of those inclined to royalty was ominously emphasized by the prominence among the conspirators in the plot of I658 of many young royalists who had hitherto shown themselves well affected to the Protector and his government This was a grave and most significant fact for this younger generation which had taken no active part in the quarrels of the past should have known no allegiance excepting that to the established government It was otherwise however and largely because these young men found themselves excluded from all participation in public affairs because they were members of Cavalier families partly too no doubt be cause of the severity with which the government of the major generals had handled the Cavaliers It was necessary to have a settlement that should strike at the sources

positively that Cromwell designed to be king and the author of the Second Narrative remarks that it  is reported  that though Cromwell refused the kingship he shath since repented his then Refusal 2 That either of these individuals spoke with authority cannot be pretended but certainly Cromwell had had reason to regret his then refusal and since he had once with much less provocation determined to accept kingship one is surely justified in inferring that now he would willingly have become king Moreover if Broghill was to be believed Cromwell had certainly concluded to accept the monarchical form of government  I hope wrote Henry Cromwell 1 his highnes brave resolutions nlot to be cozened again will beget a serenity in your lordships intentions 3 Andin May he hoped that  his highness   promises that he will ratify and prepare the army for due compliance etc would encour age Broghill not to retire4 It is clear from these quotations and from the general tone of Henrys letters that Broghill had asserted that Cromwell would  prepare the army for due compliance in other words that he was ready to assist in establishing the new monarchy That Cromwell was willing to accept such a settlement is also inferable from Thurloes letters as will be seen That such a will ingness would be apparent to the antimonarchists and that it would aggravate their opposition to kingship is selfevident They had attempted to prevent the calling of a Parliament and despite the resolution taken by the council that a Parliament should be sum moned they were still capable of delaying indefinitely the meeting of that body The leaders of the republican faction in the council hit upon a bold expedient to thwart the monarchists This was no less than the reconciliation of Cromwell with the leaders of the old Long Parliament It was suggested that to this end Vane Lud low and Rich should be taken into the council Of course this plan contemplated a considerable return to the system of the Common wealth for no one could believe that such irreconcilables as these would ever consent to the protectoral government not to speak of kingship That they had been approached is certain and that it was the antimonarchists who wished to call them into the council is also certain5 Nothing however came of this effort at reconciliation 1 Bernardi March 21 I658 Prayer 475 2Second Narrative

for our owne affaires wrote Thurloe they stand much at one staye some discourses have beene this weeke about a settle ment and how to prepare for the comeinge of a parliament but I doe assure your excellency that I cannot finde the mindes of men soe disposed as may give the nation the hopes of such a settlement as is wishd for and truly I thinke that nothinge but some unexpected providence can remove the present difficulties 1 This was on the first of June and two weeks later Fleetwood wrote that  farther considerations of what is necessary as previous to the parliament had been had but  no resolution had yet been reached2 Despairing of ever getting the matter determined by the council Cromwell now appointed a committee of nine to settle it3 Of course it was necessary to place members of both factions on this committee and Cromwell would certainly never have dreamed of constituting it otherwise The antimonarchists however had a majority though two of their number were lukewarm in opposition When Henry Cromwell was informed of the constitution of this new body he spoke with bitter scorn and contempt of the new body and of the effort to reach settlement through its mediation4 His contempt was justified for after several weeks of debate on the question of settlement the majority v voted that succession in the government was indifferent it might well be either by election or hereditary This colorless conclusion was of course satisfactory to no one and several of the antinionarchists insisted upon the and added 1 Neither do I think that your affairs will gain much reputation by their be ing in your councell He continues  Is it not also a matter worth observation who are the men that are most industrious to call in such help  May it not be a design to obstruct and clog the business when no other way is left to hinder your settlement or cover their own disaffection    He that runs along with you may more easily trip up the heals than he that wrestles with

and I feare the word desirable will be made necessary if ever it come upon the tryall  complained Thurloe The question of the succession was evidently still the kernel of the whole problem Of course if succession was to be hereditary the protectorate was in all essentials a monarchy Cromwells position is pretty clearly determinable by his recep tion of the committees report He discharged them from further consideration of the matter and declared that he would  take his own resolutions that he could no longer satisfie hymselfe to sitt still and make himselfe guilty of the losse of all the honest partye and of the nation itselfe 2 This was a decisive declaration in favor of the mnonarchists as Thurloe evidently believed Cromwell was apparently determined to act and in the way they desired Still the opposition waxed no fainter and the egress from the political cuildesac was not found I doubt the thinge most to be feared said Thurloe is that some men who oppose and I beleeve will certainly disappoint such a settlement which others can positively advise doe not know what they would have and it may be account it the best way to fix no where but to fancye themselves in the condition of Israel in the wildernesse who knewe not over night which way their journey was to lye the next morning And truly he adds with acrid pleasantry  I should rejoice to be in this condition if these gentlemen had as sure a guide as the Israel ites Only one thing was resolved uponthat a Parliament should be called as soon as possible Undoubtedly to it would have to be remitted the solution of the problem of government All speculation and all further attempts were frustrated by the events of August and September I658 The illness of Lady Clay I 4 As I take it the report was made to his highnesse upon thursday After much consideration the major part voted that succession in the government was indifferent wheither it were by election or hereditary but afterwards some would needs add

Petition and Advice 65 poole kept Cromwell from all business and put off the calling of Parliament so that it could not possibly meet before October As a consequence the Parliament never met Oliver died on the third of September and all hope of successfully settling the government excepting in the Stuarts was at an end The question concerning kingship had created a permanent division in the Cromwellian ranks a division which must result in open and irreconcilable hos tility after Olivers death while the contending factions were so nearly balanced Had he lived ten years longer no doubt he would gradually have weeded out the troublesome officers in the army reconstructed his council accepted the royal office and sup pressed the republican opposition The decisive and immediate action so much desired by his son Henry he certainly never would have taken and he would have been right in not taking it Such action might have led to an immediate insurrection and so have destroyed all prospect of settlement Men who had held power so long could not consent to being shelved in this easy fashion Besides if not friends of the younger Cromwells they were the men who had most assisted in the making of Oliver The situation demanded patience a quality always at Olivers disposal and always exercised by him Time was the essential requisite and had this been granted the line of Cromwell might well have supplanted that of Stuart There was no popular demand for the restoration of Charles II What was known of him in England was distinctly to his discredit and few even of his own partizans had hopes of his return Time however was not granted At Olivers death the position of parties was such that Richard Cromwells protectorate could not possibly endure and the only wonder is that he managed to hold his own for the space of nine months Even this would have been impossible had the opposing factions been resolved upon anything had they not been in such a condition that they did  not knowe what they would have  and could  fix no where When once they had reached a concliision Richard fell and so far as the Puritan cause was concerned all could say as Oliver feared he might be compelled to say  Actum est de Anglia RALPH C H CATTERALL 1  Thes late providences hath much retarded our publicke resolutions that it will be October ere the parliament can sitt Fleetwood to H

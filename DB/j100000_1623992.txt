EDUCATION IN opening the proceedings of this fourth annual meeting of the Society for the Pro motion of Engineering Education I wish first of all to congratulate the Society upon its great success thus far in accomplishing the object for which it was founded an ob ject fully expressed in its name The vol umes of its proceedings already published are filled with discussions and the ripe con clusions of the best thought that can be expressed today upon many phases of en gineering education No one who deAires to become informed upon these matters ca afford to neglect these volumes It is be lieved that all interested in the object of our Society will find it to their advantage to unite with us One striking peculiarity of engineering education seems to me to lie in the fact that it has been determined so largely as to its scope and the lines of its development by the engineering colleges themselves in ad vance of the formulated demands of the engineering profession and of the public in general and often indeed in opposition to such demands Through the wisdom and foresight of these organizers of engineering education the profession of engineering has come forth during this generation into pub lic estimation as a learned and responsible profession quite the peer of law or medi cine This is the work of the engineering colleges and from the deliberations of this Society it is evident that they still have a large work before them The eduleational institutions of our country are in a state of flux The present movement in education is powerful These times will be looked back to in future days as those in which mighty educational forees were inaugurated and were adapted to the needs of the nation just as it was coming to its full conscious ness as one of the great family of nations a consciousness of power and responsibility that is causing it to depart somewhat from the revered advice of Washingtonwhich was to keep aloof from European affairs and en tanglements with other nations of the earth and work out its own destiny by itself National growth and our multiplied faicili ties for communication have greatly modi4OCTOBER 1 1897 SCIENCE 503 fled our feeling asto this The triumphs of the engineer in applying steam and elec tricity are making of one blood all nations of the earth But the one thing that is making and will make of us a nation worthy of our heritage is our educational life Our republican institutions the pride of our eearly national life cannot continue such except for the reinforcement and help to come from the enlarged scope of education today It has seemed to Ime that I could not perhaps use the short time allotted to me for this address better than in trying to summarize some of the thoughts which have appeared in the papers and discussions ibe fore this Society which had its beginning in the Engineering Congress of the Colum bian Exposition at Chicago What I have to say is called forth by the enlarged re sponsibilities and new conception of the professional position of the engineer of to day and the course of study necessary to fit him for the responsibilities of his posi tion And first of all I think I am right in say ing that the demand is growing stronger that courses of engineering instruction sha1l include nothing else that is that they shall be as completely professional in their char acter as are professional courses in law and medicine This demand is not made by the general public nor to any great extent I think by practicioners in the engineering profession These are greatly ilmpressed with the ne cessity the engineer has for general culture and rightly so The demand is one made by the engineering colleges themselves At present the curriculum of our average engineering college includes from 20 to 25 per cent of culture studies such as English French and German from 30 to 25 per cent oflndirectly technical study as Mathe matics Physics etc and 50 per cent of kdirectly technical study The culture studies are of fundamental importance to the engineer He usually obtains far too small an amount of such study before graduation He finds himself poorly fitted in this respect for his subse quent career His preparation in the use of language for writing and speaking has been too meager He finds that his pro fessional work is not of a character to supplement his education in this particular Yet culture studies are out of place in any engineering course with strongly marked technical tendencies Both student and instructor feel this The two kinds of studyinterferewith each other The stu dent cannot fix his attention on culture study while absorbed in the beginnings of technical study The instructor in the culture studies feels the hopelessness of the task and must perforce be content with a lifeless memoriter fulfilment of task work The instructors in the technical studies are apt to be impatient at the time and atten tion demanded by the culture studies as more or less of an obstacle and hindrance to what is rightly regarded as the students main work Under such circumstances as these it seems clear that the culture studies must soon disappear from our engineering courses This ohange will doubtless come about gradually and will occur in the more fully developed courses first It will not mean that culture studies shall be omitted from the education of the engineer It will simply mean that he must obtain them out side of the engineering course preferably before he enters it The tendency on every hand is to insist more strongly than hereto fore upon the culture studies as essential to the engineer To insure large sucess he mnust be a man of broad culture He is to direct large enterprises as well as plan the necessary structure and machineryof the plant and that man will succeed M ho by the influence of his peronality with504 SCIENCE N S VOL VI No 144 tongue and pen shows himself able to hold his position as the peer of other great organizers of our industrial life The highest success is to be quickly reached as a rule only by those engineers who have had adequate preliminary education in cul ture studies nhich is another name for the liberal arts Such culture is now most readily and suitably attained by pursnling some part more or less complete of a reg ular college course This will come to be regarded more and more as the best prepa ration for a professional course in engineer ing as it is now for a professional course in law and medicine Following the consideration of the cul ture studies comes that of the indirectly technical studies such as mathematics me chanics physics chemistry and drawing which at the present time occupy between onethird and onefourth of the time of the average engineering course These studies rightfully have place in the course but the question whether the amount and quality of the work at present accomplished is entirely satisfactory is one whichl has been much de bated It may be said fairly I think that the standard of work in mathematics me chanics and physics has been gradually but surely advancing in all the engineering colleges against the opposition of a large part of those engaged in engineering prac tice who have been largely opposed to teaching more mathematics etc than they themselves were taught saying that they have had no use for much of that which was taught them This argument has seemed perfectly conclusive to those who have advanced it and also to the student who naturally finds such studies hard and as he thinks much in the way of his rapidly advancing to purely technical study This view has also often met acceptance with the technical professors who are largely in sympathy with those engaged in practice But the argument is fallacious as I am convinced The contrary view has prevailed in the papers before this So ciety We are to look upon this gradual advance of the standard in mathematics etc as a movement which has not as yet ceased but one still in progress Perhaps the point of greatest difficulty so far as mathematicsis concerned has been to have the differential and integral calculus so incorporated into the engineering courses as to really become part of the working equipment of the student That may not have been completely accomplished as yet but that is the standard now regarded as essential and one which is more and more nearly attained year by year It is my opinion that it will not be satisfactorily reached until the course in calculus includes the treatment of differential equations This conclusion is forced upon me not merely by the abstract consideration that physical and mechanical questions find their expression best by the use of differential equations but the problems arising just now in the theory of alternating currents must evidently be treated on the basis of their differential equations Heretofore it has been possible to satisfy the student as to the treatment and solution of the me chanical and physical problems in his course without special study of differential equations though he was likely to meet a number of points that were puzzling and unsatisfactory by reason of his ignorance of that subject But now the matter can no longer be avoided I think as no other treatment can give the necessary insight into the complicated phenomena which must be fully mastered today by the stu dent in electricity Mechanics too and physics have taken on a larger and larger significance The principles of mechanics underlie all phys ical phenomena and all engineering pro cesses Their formal study has been found to be of increasing importance in underOCTOBER 1 1897 SCIENCE 505 standing the strength and resistance of ma terials the thermodynamics of steam and gasengines turbines electrical generators motors and transformers As to physics and chemistry it is unnec essary for me to explain how small are the opportunities compared with what is de sirable The state of knowledge in these sciences is steadily advancing Hertz waves and Rontgen rays are meeting tech mical applications and new knowledge must have place The field constantly increases More time must be taken for such subjects We cannot escape it It seems impractica ble to secure it by having more physics and chemistry taught in the preparatory schools Such work is not satisfactory It is pref erable to relegate more of the pure math ematics to those schools We are to look in the future as I think for an increase in the amount and an im provement in the quality of the work in all that part of the work in our engineering courses which though but indirectly tech nical affords the theoretical basis of the strictly technical studies of the course The improvement in the quality of the instruction will lie for one thing along the line of the illustrations and problems em ployed in seeing to it that they have to do with things tangible and in the direction of practice This will help secure the neces sary interest in theory and make it as it should be the basis of practice We now come to the consideration of those studies which are strictly and directly technical They occupy in most engineer ing courses at least one half of the course The improvements which have taken place in engineering courses have occurred more largely in this part of the work than else where but great divergence of opinion has naturally arisen as to what is best In cer tain courses of mechanical engineering an excessive amount of manual training and shop work was at first introduced inex pert opinion still lays undue emphasis upon this part of the course in mechanical and electrical engineering But as the true function of manual training and trades schools comes to be better understood and their value to the community in developing handicraft and in furnishing education to the artisan as distinguished from the pro fessional engineer not only will such schools be well supported and greatly in creased in number but they will be sharply distinguished in the minds of all from the engineering colleges These last are not intended to make skilled workmen though some seem still to think so The engi neering student needs a comparatively small amount of practice in wood working which shall be especially directed toward pattern making a short experience in the blacksmith shop and foundry and some what more of metal working by hand and machine tools together with the manage ment of boilers and steam engines But any effort to make prolonged exercises in these subjects take the place of more theo retical study in an endeavor to make a workman or a foreman instead of an en gineer The same is true of extended civil engi neering field practice with instruments It is quite possible to put too great emphasis upon it and consume more time with it than the study warrants The temptation to do that is strong It must be remem bered however that surveying is not to day the principal occupation of most engi neers The plan of putting shop practice field work and other like practical parts of the course into the long vacations has much in its favor and seems to be coming more into vogue The student should grad uate from the shop and the surveying corps as soon as he has obtained a moderately good acquaintance with tools and processes and enter the testing laboratory That is the true field for extended practical work in506 SCIENCE N S VOL VI No 144 the engineering course In it the work should be arranged with regular sets of graded exercises covering the measure ment proper records and working out the results of tests on all the materials and pro cesses treated in the theoretical work of the student as well as whatever he is likely to encounter in practice or inspection It is only by prolonged drill in testing that he can acquire the necessary basis for that professional and practical judgment which will make his opinion of value While thus insisting on testing laboratories as the best and mostimportant recent development of our engineering colleges as well as one of the most costly parts of them it is needful to insist at the same time and with still greater emphasis on the paramount im portance of the theoretic instruietion in the mathematical mechanical and scientific principles which should furnish the core of every engineering course This it is which engineering colleges must teach and trades schools may entirely omit Engineering colleges may leave out shops and labora tories and some do so they may omit cul ture studies and have very imperfect in struction in drawing aind design without forfeiting the claim to give engineering courses of considerable value but no engi neering college can afford at the risk of im perilling its reputation and usefulness to neglect or slight for any length of time to put forth its best efforts to thoroughly in doctrinate its students in as complete and extended a theoretical treatment of the en gineering subjects it teaches as the time at its disposal and the preparation of its stu dents will permit Drawing and designing shop practice and testing general culture and professional information all are sub sidiary and auxiliary to this one thing Engineering courses at first began with little else in them of importance to the pro fession than this and by it they have proved themselves indispensable to it It is a mistake too frequently made by prac titioners deeply immersed in the details of their profession to suppose that the most important and fruitful field of instruction is not just here Practice experience judgment will come in time to the young engineer even if he should not have it before graduation but study and theory he will not usually thus attain to That must be had before gradua tion or the engineering college has little excuse for existence This being granted the fact still remains that the ultimate success of the engineer as a professional man depends upon his char acter and force as a man among men upon his culture upon his integrity upon his tact and social power In other professions such qualities receive continuous culture in the practice of the profession It is far less so with the engineer Here then is an argument for broad preliminary culture before entering upon engineering study but it likewise points to something with which the engineering colleges have thus far not busied themselves to any appreci able extent but which in the future cannot be neglected in justice to the position which the profession is called to occupy Every engineering student has the right to careful instruction in a recognized code of profes sional ethics which shall instruct his con science and fortify his will and give him a satisfying consciousness of duty done to his professional brethren to the public and to the judge of all the earth IUntil such instruction shall take its place in our engineering courses the public can never rely upon organized professional opinion to restrain unprofessional conduct nor can individual members of the profes sion be sustained in courses of right action against the demands of corporations and combinations of capital It remains then for engineering colleges to help organize the profession and to furnish the basis of suchOCTOBERD 1 1897  SCIEN aE5 organization in acode of professional ethics which shall be worthy unifying and eleva ting Onue step further in this direction is also of importance namely Provision for such instruction in the law of contracts as will enable the engineer to discharge with con fidence his professional obligations and protect the interests of his employers For it is not only necessary that he should have the scientific and technical knowledge to adapt the forcesg of nature to the projects in view and exercise good judgment as to the best means of doing this as well as have the ability fully and clearly to set forth his plans in a manner to carry con viction to those seeking his services but it is also equally necessary that when en trusted with the responsibilities of actual construction he should be able so clearly and explicitly to set forth the rights and obliga tions of all parties that disputes and legal difficulties may not arise stuch as often are more costly and troublesome than errors of design The place toA obtain the necessary legal knowledge of specifications and con tracts is during the professional engineering course It has been urged by soretbhat economic design as dependent upon the market price of materials labor and power should also find place in the engineering course but the consensus of best opinion seems to draw the line here between education and prac tice While the attention of the student should undoubtedly be drawn briefly yet pointedly to the economic limitations under which commercial work is done the attempt to make designs under such limitations should be mostly left to the time when judgment has ripened and the complex con ditions of practice are better known by ex perience In fact almost no undergraduate work can usefully reproduce competitive conditions and the attempt to do this must usually be regarded with distrust The aim of teaching is not anobject lesson under business conditions but thorough instruc tion in underlying principles especially those theoretica1 and scientific principles which cannot be correctly estimated by the layman It will be noticed in all the matters in which I have attempted to reflect the opinions which are current in the papers that have been presented to this Society and published in its proceedings the movement and tendencies which I have sketched can be traced all of them to a single source namely to the position of influence and re sponsibility which the professional engineer has but recently come to occupy That position is what it is today in the esteem and respect of the public largely through the wise efforts of the managers and instruc tors of the engineering colleges Their work in moulding and directing the engi neering education in the future will I am persuaded be no less important than in the past That such guidance shall continue to be wise its progress healthful and costly mistakes be avoided will be materi ally assisted by the deliberations and discus sions of this Society The valuable report of the committee on entrance requirements now in your hands is an important piece of work taking rank beside the other great educational re ports upon the various phases of secondary education which bave attracted such gen eral attention during a few years past and have influenced so greatly the work of the preparatory schools as well as the require ments of the colleges I regard it as a happy omen that we are met to hold this meeting so early in our history here in Toronto thereby expressing our interest in the promotion of engineering education as a branch of applied science confined by no geographical boundaries or limitations as well as our conviction that some of the most vital elements of human508 SCIENCE N S VOLVI No 144 progress will be moulded by the conclusions we shall reach Let us address ourselves to the work before us with the same fraternal zeal that has characterized the meetings of the Society in the past and that in fact is singularly characteristic of that noble body of men who practice the profession of engi neering a profession whose triumphs are ouir pride and whose future greatness it is the object of this Society to foster  E HENRY T EDDY UNIVERSITY OF

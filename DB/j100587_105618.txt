BENEDICT FERNER PROFESSOR OF ASTRONOMY AT UPSAL AND F R S TO THE REV THOMAS BIRCH DD SECRETARY TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY TRANSLATED FROM THE FRENCH REVEREND SIR T W O REASONS ENGAGE ME TO PAY YOU MY RESPECTS ON OCCASION OF THE PASSAGE OF VENUS OVER THE SUNS DISK ON THE 6TH PAST THE FIRST IS MY DUTY TO GIVE YOU SOME ACCOUNT OF WHAT WAS DONE HERE UPON THIS ARTICLE AND THE OTHER IS FOUNDED UPON THE INTEREST I HAVE IN BEING INFORMED HOW VENUS WAS OBSERVED WITH YOU READ NOV 19 1761 MESSIEURS MARALDI DE LA LANDE AND DE LISLE WITH MR MESSIER REMAINED IN TOWN AT THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY IN THE PALACE OF LUXEMBOURG AND AT THE HOTEL DE CLUGNY MESSIEURS DE LA CAILLE LE MONNIER DE FOUCHY AND MYSELF WENT OUT TO CON FLANS ST HUBERT AND TO THE CHATEAU DE LA MUETTE WHERE THE KINGS PHILOSOPHICAL AND OPTICAL CHAMBER IS IT WAS IN THIS LAST PLACE WHICH IS SITUATED 1412 OF TIME TO THE WEST OF THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY THAT I MADE MY OBSERVATIONS IN COMPANY WITH MONS DE FOUCHY IN ORDER TO TAKE THE DISTANCES OF VENUS FROM THE LIMBS OF THE SUN FOR WANT OF A GOOD MICROMETER I MADE USE OF A QUADRANT OF 212 FEET MADE BY LAN GLOIS AND FOR OBSERVING THE EGRESS I HAD A GOOD RE FLECTING222 FLECTING TELESCOPE OF 28 INCHES FOCUS AND 5 INCHES APERTURE WHICH MAGNIFIED ABOUT 80 TIMES THE TE LESCOPE WAS MADE BY PERE NOEL I WILL NOT ENLARGE UPON THE PRECAUTIONS I TOOK FOR THE BENEFIT OF MY OB SERVATIONS IN ORDER TO ASSUME A VAIN PRETENSION OF HAVING ATTAINED TO THE LAST PRECISION IT IS SUFFICIENT TO ASSURE YOU I MADE THEM IN THE BEST MANNER THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD ADMIT OF HAVING CALCULATED AND REDUCED MY OBSERVATIONS TO THE ROYAL OBSERVA TORY AT PARIS I FOUND THAT THE WESTERN LIMB OF VENUS TOUCHED THE WESTERN LIMB OF THE SUN OR THAT THE LU MINOUS THREAD OF THE SUN WAS BROKE BY HER H   AT       8 28 29 TRUE TIME MORN LAST CONTACT AT   8 46 43 CONJUNCTION OF  WITH  5 52 20 SOUTHERN LATITUDE OF  0 9 32    LONGITUDE OF  BEING 2S 14 32 23 I SOMETIMES MEASURED THE DIAMETER OF VENUS WITH A BAD MICROMETER BUT FINDING THERE WAS BUT LITTLE ACCOUNT TO BE MADE OF IT I DISCONTINUED THE USE OF IT DURING THE OBSERVATION I HAD RECOURSE TO DIFFERENT COLOURED GLASSES TO WIT A BLACK GLASS SUCH AS IS MADE AT GLASSHOUSES A COMMON SMOKED GLASS AND A GLASS OF A BLUE AND GREEN MIXED HALF OF WHICH WAS SLIGHTLY SMOKED IN USING THE BLACK GLASS THE DISK OF THE SUN AND THAT OF VENUS WERE BADLY DEFINED AND THE SPOTS OF THE SUN APPEARED BUT FAINTLY I SAW A LITTLE BETTER WITH THE COMMON SMOKED GLASS AND WITH THE HALFSMOKED GREEN AND BLUE GLASS BUT WHEN I VIEWED223 I VIEWED THE SUN WITH THAT PART OF THESE GLASSES WHICH WAS NOT SMOKED I FOUND THE SUN WHITE AND A LITTLE BLUISH THE SMALLEST SPOTS VERY DISTINCT AND THE DISKS OF THE SUN AND VENUS MUCH BETTER DEFINED THAN I COULD WITH THE OTHER GLASSES BUT THE EDGES OF BOTH LIMBS UNDULATING PARTICULARLY THOSE OF VENUS DURING THE WHOLE TIME OF MY OBSERVING WITH THE TELESCOPE AND THE BLUE AND GREEN GLASSES I PERCEIVED A LIGHT ROUND ABOUT VENUS WHICH FOLLOWED HER LIKE A LUMINOUS ATMOSPHERE MORE OR LESS LIVELY ACCORDING AS THE AIR WAS MORE OR LESS CLEAR ITS EXTENT ALTERED IN THE SAME MANNER NOR WAS IT WELL TERMINATED THROWING OUT AS IT WERE SOME FEEBLE RAYS ON ALL SIDES WHEN I LOOKED THROUGH THE SMOKED PART I SAW BUT BADLY BY THE COMMON SMOKED GLASS YET WORSE AND BY THE BLACK GLASS NOT AT ALL THE INTERIOR CONTACT OF VENUS WITH THE SUNS LIMB HAPPENED SOONER THAN I EXPECTED BY JUDGING OF THE DISTANCES OF VENUS FROM THE LIMB OF THE SUN AT DIF FERENT TIMES AS FOR THE LAST CONTACT I SHOULD NOT BE SURPRIZED IF THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE OF 10 OR 12 BE TWEEN TWO OBSERVERS WHO HAD INSTRUMENTS AND EYES OF EQUAL GOODNESS AND MADE THEIR OBSERVATIONS BY THE SAME CLOCK SO DIFFICULT A MATTER DO I THINK IT TO DETER MINE THE EXACT MOMENT BUT FOR THE FIRST I CER TAINLY BELIEVE THAT THE DIFFERENCE COULD SCARCE AMOUNT TO MORE THAN 2 UNDER THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES HOWEVER THE FOLLOWING ARE GREATER DIFFERENCES FOR THE FIRST CONTACT THAN WERE EXPECTED H   1ST CONTACT AT 8 28 42 MR MARALDI OBSERVED 2D CONTACT AT 8 46 54 LABBE224 H   1ST CONTACT AT 8 28 37 LABBE DE LA CAILLE 2D CONTACT AT 8 46 4912 1ST CONTACT AT 8 28 27 MR MESSIER OBSERVED 2D CONTACT AT 8 46 37 PERE NOEL    1ST CONTACT AT 8 28 27 MR FOUCHY   2D CONTACT AT 8 46 42 1ST CONTACT AT 8 28 29 MR FERNER   2D CONTACT AT 8 46 43 1ST CONTACT AT 8 28 25 TO 26 MR DE LA LANDE  2D CONTACT AT 8 46 54 CONSIDERING THE QUICKNESS WITH WHICH THE LUMI NOUS THREAD OF THE SUNS LIMB WAS BROKEN BY THE APPROACH OF VENUSS LIMB I HAVE SUFFICIENT FOUNDA TION FOR SUPPOSING THAT ALMOST ALL THE DIFFERENCE BE TWEEN THESE OBSERVATIONS FOR THE FIRST CONTACT DEPENDS SOLELY UPON THE DIFFERENT GOODNESS OF THE INSTRUMENTS AND PARTICULARLY THE MEASURING THE TIME IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE LAST CONTACT AGREE FOR THE SAME REASONS THAT THE OTHERS DIFFER FROM ONE ANOTHER BEING IN COMPANY LAST NIGHT AT SUPPER WITH MR DE LA LANDE  I HAD THE PLEASURE OF HEARING HIM DO THE ENGLISH NATION JUSTICE WITH REGARD TO WHAT THE LEARNED WORLD OWE IT EXPRESSING AT THE SAME TIME A VERY GREAT DESIRE OF SEEING ENGLAND AS SOON AS PEACE IS ESTABLISHED BETWEEN IT AND HIS OWN COUNTRY IN THE MEAN TIME HE

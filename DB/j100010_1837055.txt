replaced it to a considerable degree There is no evidence that the Christian Church made any serious effort to abolish either slavery or serfdom in that age There were slaves in all countries and the Church seemed to approve of it at least she gave no evi dence of regret at being unable to reconcile this condition with the spirit of the Gospel Sporadic individtuals to be sure did express their conviction that the words of Christ  All ye are brethren  wotuld find an admirable practical application in the freeing of slaves Chutrch assemblies issuied a smiall number of decrees intended to improve the lot of slaves The Church too took the emanci pated under her protection Still the number of slaves was not noticeably decreased thereby Unfortunately it cannot be denied that the Church made provisions whereby in certain cases freemen were reduced to slavery and uinder some circumnistances aided in establishing slavery where it did not before exist Indeed the Chturch herself held many slaves and opposed their emancipation The beginning of a letter of emancipation by Pope Gregory the Great is famous Two slaves Alontana and Thomas both belonging to the Roman Church were freed by him He alludes to the love of the Saviour who did not hesitate to become man in order to free us from the chains of bondage in which we lay and restore us to ouir original freedom  Man  he continues  was created free in the beginning by Nature he does well therefore who restores to men the freedom in which they were born A similar spirit breathes from a letter of emancipation issued five centuries later by the abbot and chapter of the abbey of St Pere in Chartres It begins with the words In the name of Him Who to redeem a slave did not spare His Son but surrendered Him for tis all Jesus Christ our Lord 3 Another document of similar origin recalls the prophecy of Jeremiah xxxiv in the time of King Zedekiah when Jeruisalem was being besieged by Nebuchadnezzar The more prom 2 Gregory the Great

Israelites had agreed to proclaim a year of jubilee that is to free all slaves of Hebrew origin The agreement however was not kept For this reason the prophet declared that God would bring back the Babylonians from whom the Jews had had a short respite and would proclaim for Judah  a liberty to the sword to the pesti lence and to the famine  This story teaches us so says the letter of emancipation how pleasing a sacrifice to God is the restoration of liberty to a man languishing in slavery4 Again a certain Richel dis is freed both for the love of the highest Emancipator Almighty God and because of the desire of her father5 About the same time Count Fulk of Anjou and his sister Ermengardis promise to give a certain slave his liberty  for the good of the soul of their father Fulk and for the forgiveness of their sins  Nevertheless there is no evidence that many shared the religious views which found expression in these utterances Whatever may have influenced the hearts of some of the best and noblest persons they were powerless over against the majority powerless in the face of the incalculable economic importance of slavery in the medieval world Indeed there is no trace of serious effort on any consid erable scale to change conditions In the biographies of ceftain saints one reads that before they entered the monastery they freed many slaves 7 of others that they redeemed warcaptives and sent them back to their homes free men8 Such deeds may have pro voked sympathy and even admiration but they had no notable effect on the persistence of slavery as an institution It is necessary to consider the matter more in detail One finds 4Cartulaire de lAbbaye de StPere de Chartres ed Guerard t II no 5I p 507 Quam gratum et acceptabile Deo sit sacrificium

Christians of the seventh9 and eighth centuries 10 they are not lacking in the tenth1 and eleventh 12 in the twelfth13 thirteenth14 fourteenth15 and later16 they still exist At a council held in Toledo 656 complaint was made that clerics sold Christian slaves to Jews With many quotations from the Scriptures the council prohibited this practice17 Why did not the Patres conscripti condemn the whole slavetrade They ap peal to such a text as i Corinthians xii 13  For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we are bond or free and have been all made to drink into one Spirit But they did not draw the conclusion Slavery is con trary to the Gospel No more did Ratherius of Verona when about three centuries later he wrote his Praeloquia In it he addresses all classes of society On the one hand he comforts the slave with the assurance that all men are brethren on the other he exhorts him to see in his bondage an ordinance of divine providence8 Art thou slave Let it not grieve thee If thou hast served thy master faithfully thou shalt be a freedman of God the Lord of us all for in Christ are we all brethren Hear what the Apostle says i Pet ii i8   Servants be subject to your masters with all fear  Both God and your earthly masters ye can fear in two ways first with the fear of blows scourging and imprisonment and the eternal fire since  who soever resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of God  Rom xiii 2 But of this first fear it is said that love casteth it out The other fear is of a purer kind and endures eternally It is the fear of indolence and idleness the fear of the loss of that glory which awaits those who labor vigorously If now thou hast stolen hours from thy master re turn them to thy Creator i e in the form of alms etc And do not think that thou art slave accidentally and without the will of divine providence Hear what Isidore says  Because of the first mans sin slavery was imposed by God on mankind as a punishment in such a way that He mercifully destined those to slavery for whom He saw that freedom would not be fitting Though this be a result of original sin Tenth synod of Toledo 656 C 7 in Mansi

the Middle Ages 679 still God has determined the lot of all men with perfect justice in mak ing one a slave and another a master in order that the slaves oppor tunity of doing evil may be limited by the power of the master Finer words expressed the sentiments of the synod of Chalons 8I3 19 The indisputable truth is that persons of different classes such as nobles freemen slaves bondmen tenants and the like belong to the Church Therefore it is fitting that all clerics as well as laymen who are placed over others should treat them with consideration and mercy not only in the demanding of statute labor and taxes but also in the col lecting of debts For they must not forget that these are their brethren that they both have one God and Father to whom they pray  Our Father Who art in Heaven  and a single holy mother the Church How did one become a slave One way was by selling one self because of poverty It might so happen that a married pair sank into such need that the husband was compelled to sell himself and did so with his wifes consent In this way he secured suste nance for himself and with the purchasemoney he was in a position to keep his wife from starving Sometimes the conditions were reversed and the wife sold herself with the same intentions and with her husbands consent In such cases the marriage was usually dissolved to be sure the Church opposed this but could not prevent and therefore yielded to it20 Besides this one could mortgage him self A synod at Paris early in the seventh century ordained that freemen who had sold or mortgaged themselves should if they repaid the money at once be restored to their former status To demand back a greater sum than what had been paid for them was not allowed2 It is true that a synod at Rheims about 624 forbade that anyone persuade a freeman to become a slave22 Was much accomplished by it It is only too true that the sladetrade con tinued to exist Formulas of certificates of sale have been preserved in considerable numbers23 An estate is sold together with its slaves and serfs24 The penitential of Theodore of Canterbury secures to 9 Synod of Chalons 8I3 C 5I in Mansi XIV 104 20 Synod of Vermeria 753

old could surrender himself into slavery25 According to Vinniaus the married freeman who had consorted with a slave should be compelled to sell the woman if he had one or several sons by her he must set her free and was not allowed to sell her26 While the slavetrade in general was not prohibited by the synod of Chalons 644 the selling of slaves outside the kingdom that is outside of the dominions of King Chlodwig II was forbidden the purpose was to prevent the delivery of Christian slaves into the power of Jewish masters27 Similar prohibitions were repeatedly issued For instance the synod of Liftina under the presidency of Boniface declared that it was unlawful to sell Christian slaves to heathen28 The English synod of Berkhampstead 697 is an excep tion It decreed that if a slave had stolen his master must at the discretion of the king either pay a sum of seventy solidi as com pensation or sell the slave beyond the sea29 Of prohibiting the trade in Christian slaves among Christians there was never a word no one thought of protesting against it or at least showed any incli nation to do so Duke Tassilo of Bavaria summoned a synod to Neuching 772 The first decree reads Duke Tassilo with the consent of the whole assembly of bishops and abbots has deter mined that no one may sell a slave outside the boundaries of his province no matter whether the slave is his property or has come into his power as a fugitive30 But observe  the boundaries of his province everything hinges on that According to Regino of Priim too not the slavetrade as such but slavetrade under certain conditions is punishable For he enjoined that the bishop should inquire in his synodal court  Has any one stolen or by means of enticement secured possession of a freeman anothers slave or a foreigner and sold him into bondage out of the country Has any one sold a Christian slave to Jew or heathen Are the Jews selling Christian slaves 31 It is always the same thing only certain kinds of slavetrade are condemned A 25 Poenitentiale Theodori c I3 par I 2 in Wasserschleben p 217 2 Poenitentiale Vinniai par 39 40 ibid p II7 Poenitentiale Cummeani c 3 par 32 ibid p 474  Synod of Chalons

for many years for wages he was finally rated as a slave by his master and sold Regino of Priim in whose time this occurred disap proved of it very strongly32 But who ever protested against the slavetrade as such A slight change of opinion seems to be evident at the synod sum moned to Coblenz by the Frankish King Charles the Simple and Henry I of Germany It was there asked what should be done with one who sold a Christian The unanimous answer was that he should be considered guilty of murder33 But note well that there is no mention of the selling of nonChristians Even the evil spe cifically mentioned in the decree was not extirpated by it as is evi dent from an Ordo Poenitentiae of the time of Otto IIJ34 In ioo9 in England the only censure is that Christians sometimes innocent ones were sold out of the country even to heathen people35 In the time of Gregory VII the Scots still sold their wives36 Accord ing to the synod of Szabolcs 1092 if a priest instead of taking a wife had chosen a servant or a slave as a companion she was to be sold and the proceeds were to be given to the bishop37 A shock ing condition is revealed by a decree of the synod of London I I02 Let no one dare hereafter to engage in the infamous business prevalent in England of selling men like animals38 The stern prohibition provokes sympathy and reflects credit on the English bishops Still it is to be observed that the slavetrade not slavery was condemned And did this sentence affect every form of slave trade or only that particular form then prevalent in England Be that as it may the slavetrade continued in England The English even before they suffered from poverty and starvation were in the habit of offering their sons and relatives for sale in Ireland The Irish obtained English slaves not only from merchants but also from robbers and pirates On the other hand the English pene trated into Ireland and made slaves of the Irish39 32Regino De Ecclesiasticis Disciplinis 1 ii

under the presidency of Charle magne decreed that slaves could be sold only in the presence of a representative of the ecclesiastical or temporal power that is of the bishop or count the archdeacon or the centenarius40 What was the object of this order Perhaps it was to regulate the slavetrade to subject it to hard and fast rules Some came under the power of others through theft both free men and slaves were stolen4 Slavery was also ordained as a pun ishment for theft prostitution or other sins42 From all appearances medieval society must have contained a much larger number of slaves than has been generally supposed43 In spite of all prohibitions Christian slaves served Jewish masters44 Mothers had their children nursed by slaves45 Monasteries pos sessed slaves From the penitential of the Greek Theodore Arch bishop of Canterbury it appears that the Greek monks did not have slaves but that the Roman monks did46 A shocking fact is that the Church herself often possessed slaves We find slaves of the Church in Spain47 in the kingdom of the Franks48 in Germany 4 in Hungary50 in Italy5l Occasionally slaves of the Church were admitted to holy orders The synod of Toledo 655 required however that they must first have secured emanci pation through the bishop52 Clerics of this kind were forbidden to acquire private property They could not inherit or buy anything from parents or relatives Should they in the name or through the assistance of some free man succeed in acquiring anything they were to be whipped and imprisoned until the Church recovered the 40 Synod of Herstal 779

law that sons and daughters of such ecclesiastics of whatever rank even though born of a free mother were together with all their property regardless of how it was acquired to remain the property of the Church never to be freed from their sad state54 A pronouncement of the great synod of Aachen discloses some thing astonishing Many bishops admit into the number of the clergy only bondmen who dare not complain of any treatment be cause they fear hard blows or a cruel reduction to slavery This is not to say that persons of good reputation among the slaves of the Church may not be admitted to holy orders but that no prelate shall entirely exclude the nobles55 Church slaves could accept no protection from another authority56 No one might buy the inheri tance of a slave of the Church if he did he lost both the purchase money and the object bought57 It was Charlemagne who probably at the mixed assembly of princes and bishops at Paderborn 785 issued the capitulary which among other things was designed to secure revenue for local churches The peasants were to vacate for the church to which they belonged a farmyard and two mansi of land and each one hundred and twenty of them were to give the church a male and a female slave58 The Trullan synod 692 decreed that the freeing of a slave must occur before three witnesses59 A synod of Berkhampstead assumed that emancipation took place at the altar60 Did the Church earnestly promote the freeing of slaves She decreed that Jews might not buy or possess Christian slaves if they 53 Synod of Pavia IOI8 C 5 in Pertz Leges II 562 34Ibid c

substitution of a donation to the poor equivalent to the slaves price62 elsewhere the punishment was emancipation and a fine63 The female slave who bore her master one or more sons64 or in general who bore him children was freed6 Otherwise the freeing of slaves was hindered rather than helped If a father in his will granted freedom to all his slaves his daughter could require the restoration of onethird of them on the ground of the illegality of the testament66 From the fact that the Church was not disposed to give her freedmen entire independence and nearly always attached severe conditions to liberation it can be most easily seen that she was not inclined to adopt mild policies toward her slaves Bishops could not free slaves of the Church unless they reimbursed the Church out of their own property Otherwise it was said they would be taking from the poor what they did not themselves give A bishops successor might reclaim men freed by him67 In the eleventh century these regulations were included by Burchard of Worms68 and Ivo of Chartres 9 in their collections of canons They were inserted by Gratian70 and in the decretals of Gregory IX71 If a bishop desired to free a church slave wvithout reserving the right of protection to the Church he must in council give the Church in place of the one freed two other slaves equally valuable and disposing of an equal amount of money This exchange was made permanent through a document signed by the priests who were present Under such conditions manumission was unhindered the theory being that the bishop had previously acquired possession of the slave Should such a freedman later complain or testify 61 Synod of Toledo 633 cc 59 66 in Mansi X 633 635 Burchardus Wormaciensis Decretorum Libri XX 1 iv c 85 fol I28v Ivo Decretum

or who had acquired properties lands or slaves for their church could manumit slaves of the Church to the value of that property73 Frequently emancipation was coupled with conditions Idanas son who in his testament confirmed freedom formerly granted limited this freedom by the words only under observance of the conditions set down in the brief of emancipation J In general the conditions made by the Church were oppressive The chapter of the abbey church of St Pere in Chartres required of the freed man the perpetual performance of his former duties as a bondager homo75 The chapter of Notre Dame in Paris often granted freedom on conditions of the payment of a large sum either in one payment or in annual installments The inhabitants of the village of Wissous paid at one time a thousand Parisian pounds for their freedom those of Orly four thousand pounds76 The same chapter freed more than one homo slave or bondman with the purpose of admitting him to the clergy If however such an one married or withdrew from the clerical status he fell back into his former condition In order to prevent the property of any church slave or bondman from falling into the hands of free men no freedman was allowed to inherit buy or in any way acquire property from parents or relatives Finally he was required to take an oath that he would not summon to court any one subj ect to the jurisdiction of the chapter without the chapters consent77 The assertion that these limitations on the freedom of the emancipated were not designed to be burdens78 can hardly be con sidered more than a cheap evasion A

made at the sylnod of Aachen 809 that many priests devoted thenmselves both day and niglht to worldly matters to slaves to the vineyard and to the garner88 That the Chturch did not admit the slaves of others to holy orders tunless their emancipation was incontestable was no doubt salutary Only those freedmen says the synod of Toledo 633 whose patrons have retained no obsequium may become clerics

of the laws many irregu larities occurred in the ordination of former slaves For instance witnesses were bribed to testify to the actual manumission of a given person tricks of every kind were used The ordination of a man whose father or grandfather had come from elsewhere made an especially difficult case because information as to whether the ancestor was freeborn freedman or slave was not

decree of the synod of Holhenaltheim 9i6 discloses peculiar conditions A master had had his slave educated and ordained and in the meantime had given him clothiing and sustenance In the course of time the priest became arrogant and refused to say mass for his former master or to sing the canonical hours or the psalms he did not pay proper respect to his master and boasted I am free I can serve at my pleasure whom I choose Whose part did the synod take the masters or the priests The formers it anathematized the priest and excluded him from communion until he should mend his ways and obey his master If he continued stubborn the bishop who ordained him was to degrade him and restore him to his former owner Whoever had knowledge of this condition of affairs and received such a priest or

a bishop ordains a slave as priest or deacon knowing that he is unfree the slave shall remain clerk but the bishop must give his master double compensation If the bishop did not know he was a slave those must pay the compensation who testified that he was free and sought his ordination100 Despite all prohibitions there were always among the clergy actual slaves that is persons over whom others could exercise rights and from whom statute labor could be required10 Naturally there was strong opposition to such an ones becoming bishop102 Indeed it occurred that certain laymen claimed an archdeacon on the ground that he was not free but their slave103 Occasionally the Church opposed the advancement of slaves to important positions Since it had happened that slaves or freed men had through royal favor risen to palatine offices and had then persecuted their former masters the synod of Toledo 683 for bade such an advancement in the future Only freedmen or slaves of the fisc could thereafter be promoted to such offices Hefele adds because they belonged to no other master than the king and were not bound to private service104 The worst feature of all is that the Church created

their wars against Christians and even took service on their piratical craft the property of such was to be confiscated by the civil authorities and they themselves became the slaves of those who captured them14 Baptized Jews could have no intercourse with the unbaptized If they did and persisted in their relations with the infidels the latter became the property of the Christians and the

excite sympathy in wider circles There is no evidence of it In 1376 Gregory XI at enmity with the Florentines excommu nicated them and ordered them to be plundered captured and reduced to slavery in all places whatsoever122 And Nicholas V in I452 empowered Alphonso V of Portugal to make war on all Sara cens heathen and other foes of Christ to despoil them and reduce them to slavery123 What was the condition of slaves in this period From the materials at hand there is no reason to believe that their condition was one easily borne Some precepts can indeed be adduced which manifest a humane spirit but there are only slight indications that the Church seriously attempted to ameliorate the lot of slaves Kindness no doubt pro moted the instruction for confessors found in a penitential If slaves come to you do not burden them as you would their masters since slaves are not independent but reduce their penance to one half1124 Considerably after this Bishop Peter of Exeter in his guide for confessors prescribed that confessors should carefully note whether they are dealing witlh slaves or freemen125 A slave who perjured himself at his masters instigation should have a light penance according to the decree of the synod of Hohenaltheim26 Theodore of Canterbury declared it illegal to take from a slave the money he earned by his own work127 To work on Sundays whether voluntarily or at the command of a master was to slaves forbidden If however a slave worked on Sunday by the order of his master an English synod ruled that the slave became free and that the master should be fined

make a last will130 The threat of the synod of Szabolcs Io92 to punish with a twelve days pen ance on bread and water any master who failed to bring the corpse of his slave to church indicates a laudable sentiment3 Regino of Priim required the investigation in the synodal court of those cases in which persons were accused of adultery in their own homes with their maids or slaves32 This procedure no doubt afforded slaves some protection Something similar was aimed at in the rule order ing the removal of all female slaves and freedwomen from monas teries and the residences of clerks133 Nicholas I demanded that fugitive captive slaves be pardoned and faithful slaves be leniently treated34 It was illegal to restrain a slave who ran away during the Peace of God135 Pippin king of Lombardy issued a capitulary at a synod about 78I which gave detailed instructions for the recov ery of fugitive slaves36 Over against this stands the law that no slave could be the plaintiff in court37 Neither could freedmen testify in court against free men only in the third generation did their descendants become com petent to act as witnesses38 In all probability no one opposed the corporal punishment of slaves for centuries39 They were pun ished by being stripped of their clothing and beaten with rods Regino of Priim relates that several persons protested against this to the bishop or his servants The way in which he tells of it how ever makes it appear quite unlikely that he considered these com plaints justified rather the contrary40 Slaves who engaged in idolatrous

instances of slaves dying of hunger143 Whoever killed his slave without the foreknowledge of the judge was excommunicated for two years144 The object of this law was commendable but the frequent reitera tion of it leads one to surmise that the evil persisted for a long time45 One penitential extends its prohibition to cases in which the slave was actually guilty and a judicial sentence had been ren dered even the master who killed his slave must do a years pen ance146  If thou art free and hast killed an innocent slave at thy masters command thou shalt do penance a whole year and three times forty days in each of the two following years  says an opin ion of Regino of Priim If the slave deserved death only forty days penance was necessary47 In the period immediately succeed ing the conversion of the Germans it sometimes happened that Christians sold their slaves to heathen for human sacrifices48 Happily nothing is heard of it later indeed the capitulary of Charlemagne at the

freeman married a wife believing that she was free and later learned that she was unfree he could dismiss her and marry another15 It has been stated that a free man who sold himself into slavery could reacquire his former status by paying the sum he had received If he had a free wife his children by her were forever free152 Slaves who have united themselves with female slaves without a nuptial ceremony shall says Nicephorus Chartophylax be excommunicated and parted from their wives until the ceremony is performed153 This order seems harsh but it unquestionably fos tered respect for the marriages of slaves The same thing is true of the following respecting marriages between slaves of different masters such unions to be valid required the consent of both masters54 It is true also of the decision of the synod of Vermeria 753 If through sale a slave be separated from his wife also a slave each should be urged to remain thus i e not to marry again in case we cannot reunite them55 An excellent attitude is that of the synod of Chalons 813 156 We have learned that certain masters acting on usurped authority dissolve the legitimate marriages of their slaves thus ignoring the word of the Gospel  What God hath joined together let no man put asun der  Let no such marriages be dissolved even if the slaves do not belong to the same master provided the marriage was legally per formed and both masters gave their consent On the whole however there are good reasons for believing that the marriage ties of slaves were pretty loose If for example two slaves were joined in wedlock by their common master and one of them was thereafter freed that one was permitted to marry again if the freedom of the other could not be bought157 FREDERIK PIJPER 6 Synod of Compiegne 757 cc 7 8 in

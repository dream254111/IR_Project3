the Sherman Anti Trust Act has been applied to the typical combination restraining interstate com merce which that act was designed to prevent In the debate in the United States Senate on the original bill introduced by SENATOR SHERMAN he said  Associated enterprise and capital are not satisfied with partner ships and corporations competing with each other and have invented a new form of combination commonly called trusts that seeks to avoid competition by combining the controlling corporations part nerships and individuals engaged in the same business and plac ing the power and property of the combination under the gov ernment of a few individuals and often under the control of a single man called a trustee a chairman or a president The sole object of such a combination is to make competition impossible It can control the market raise or lower prices as will best pro mote its selfish interests reduce prices in a particular locality and break down competition and advance prices at will where com petition does not exist Its governing motive is to increase the profits of the parties comprising it The law of selfishness uncon trolled by competition compels it to disregard the interests of the consumer It dictates terms to transportation companies it com mands the price of labor without fear of strikes for in its field it allows no competitors Such a combination is far more dangerous than any heretofore invented and when it embraces the great body of all the corporations engaged in a particular industry in all of the states of the Union it tends to advance the price to the consumer 1 See Congressional Record Vol 2I Mat 21 1890 Bills and Debates in Congress relating to trusts 18881902 pp 956 There are many other references to the Stand ard Oil

civil law is null and void and the just subject of restraint by the courts of for feiture of corporate rights and privileges and in some cases should be denounced as a crime and the individuals engaged in it should be punished as criminals It is this kind of a combination we have to deal with now Do I exaggerate the evil we have to deal with I do not think so I do not wish to single out any particular trust or combination It is not a particular trust but the system I aim at I will only cite a very few instances of combinations that have been the sub ject of judicial or legislative inquiry to show what has been and what can be done by them as follows In Handy v C  M R R Co 31 Fed 689 693 The Standard Oil Co and George Rice were competitors in the business of refining oil the Standard desired to crush Rice and his business and under threat of building a pipe line compelled the receiver of the railroad to carry its oil at Io cents per barrel and charge Rice 35 cents per barrel for a like service and pay the Standard 25 cents out of the 35 cents thus exacted from Rice It also appears in an equity suit in Pennsylvania v Penn R R 1879 by testimony of A J Cassatt that the Standard Oil Com pany were receiving rebates of 49c per bbl on crude oil from Brad ford Oil region to tide water 5I 2c from the lower oil region to tide water and 642c from Cleveland to tide wateror the annual il legal receipts by the Standard Oil Co would have been 548000ooo I do not wish to single out the Standard Oil Company    I only refer to them because they are the oldest of these combinations founded upon contracts which have been copied by the other cor porations2 Sir now the people of the United States as well as of other countries are feeling the power and grasp of these com binations and are demanding of every legislature and of Congress a remedy for this evil only grown into huge proportions in recent times They had monopolies and mortmains of old but never before such giants as in our day You must heed their appeal or be ready for the Socialist the Communist and the Nihilist Society is now disturbed by forces never felt before3 The Supreme Court of the United States has nowafter these 21 yearsdecided4 that the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey is an unlawful combination in restraint of interstate and foreign commerce in violation of the Federal Sherman AntiTrust Act of 2 Ib Mar 24 I89o Bills  Debates p I67 s Ib Bills  Debates p ioI United States v Standard Oil Co  U S  May 15 1911 644THE STANDARD OIL DECISION I890 The courts decision to this effect is unanimous affirming the unanimous decision of the Circuit Court5 The court ruled I That the AntiTrust Act makes only con tracts and combinations in unreasonable restraint of interstate and foreign trade and commerce illegal and 2 that the Standard Oil Co of New Jersey is such a combination Chief Justice WHITE writes the opinion Mr Justice HARIAN vigorously dissenting on the first proposition Whether all the other justices concur in the result only or also upon the first proposition is not definitely stated in the reports received but that a majority of the court concurs on the first proposition is indicated by the words of the Chief Jdstice that if there are statements in former decisions inconsistent with this they are necessarily now limited and qualified The Court had no difficulty in unanimously finding from the facts that the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey was a combination in unreasonable restraint of interstate commerce The Circuit Court also had no difficulty in so unanimously finding Hence there was no question before the court requiring it to decide that the Anti trust Act applied only to combinations in unreasonable restraint of interstate commerce and it seems unusual for the court in a case where such a question is not involved to overrule two prior decisions where such a question was directly and necessarily involved and passed upon The facts are generally known and voluminous 23 volumes I2000 pages yet a summary is proper to show how unnecessary it was for the court in ithis case to announce the first proposition The following gleaned from various sources but more than con firmed by the record in the case will make this clear Oil was struck by boring in I858 in Northwestern Pennsyl vania near Titusville about 25 miles from Corry Union City and Meadville 125 miles from Cleveland and I70 from Pittsburg by rail The Pennsylvania road reached Corry and Union City and from the latter connected with the Lake Shore 25 miles away at Erie the Erie road ran through Corry Union City and Meadville In I863 the Oil Creek railroad reached Titusville and Oil City from Corry and the Erie road built to Franklin in I868 the Lake Shore completed a line to Oil City By I868 successful pipe lines storage reservoirs and transferable oil certificates were in use The first refinery had been built in 1862 in which the processes yet in use were employed In I865 Mr J D Rockefeller went into the refining business at Cleveland In 1867 he took in his brother William and H M Flagler In I868 Mr Rockefeller represented to General 5 I73 Fed I77 I52 Fed 290 645MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW Devereux VicePresident of the Lake Shore road that building refineries at the oil regions would ruin the Cleveland refineries and destroy the oil traffic of the road a rebate of 15 cents per barrel from the 40 cent rate on the crude oil from the fields was made to Mr Rockefeller and he agreed to fight it out with the oil region refineries6 In I870 the Standard Oil Co of Ohio was formed by Mr Rockefeller and his associates with a capital stock of Ioooooo and their refining capacity was 600 barrels of crude oil daily7the production of all the 150 refineries of the country being 15000 bar rels daily8 Some of the railroad officials became stockholders in the Standard Oil Co9 In 1871 May 6 the South Improvement Co was chartered in Pennsylvania with very broad powers this was brought to Mr Rockefellers attention as early as October 187110 and he and four other Standard Oil Co members took 1375 shares of the 2000 of its stock and Peter Watson freight agent of the Lake Shore took Ioo more The company was organized Watson made president and January I8 1872 a contract was entered into with the railroads signed by the presidents or managers whereby oil rates were to be doubled and the South Improvement Co was to have rebates 40 cents out of 80 cents on crude oil to Cleveland I06 out of 256 to New York on crude oil shipped by it and 50 cents out of 200 on refined from Cleveland to New York and in addition to these rebates the South Improvement Co was to have drawbacks to the same amount on all oil shipped by all other ship pers the rate from the oil fields to New York 125 miles nearer than Cleveland was made 292or 92 cents higher the railroads agreed to furnish all way bills of all oil shipped by any one and open their books to them the Improvement Co and do everything they could to insure them against loss or injury by competition Feb ruary 12 the Standard increased its stock to 2500000 and Mr Rockefeller proceeded to Cleveland and told the thirty refineries there that if they didnt sell their property to him it would be value lessthat there was a combination of railroad and oil men12 The result was that of the thirty refineries all but four or five sold out at from 45 to 65 per cent of their value13 The premature putting into 6 Miss Tarbell McClure Nov I902 and following 7 Indus Cor R 606 689 8 Ib 547 626 647 Ib 606 645 690

led to riotst4 in the oil regions and the railroads were obliged to abrogate it and there fol lowed legislative investigations and the repeal of the charter March 25 1872 A new contract was made with perfect equality to all shippers which didnt last two weeks and it soon became apparent that the railroads were doing for the Standard secretly just what they had publicly contracted to do for the South Improvement Co5 The details are obscure in some places The result however was perfectly apparent The Standard first acquired control of the local pipe lines by means of drawbacks of 22 cents per barrel allowed to the Standard linesand the other local lines died off like sheepl6 In 1875 lower rates were given the Standard on western shipments by allowing them to ship tank cars averaging Ioo barrels and billing them at 80 barrels and although the tariff rates were charged ac cording to some prearranged method a portion was refunded under the names of drawbacks or rebates7 This contract lasted till i88318 To enable the Standard to acquire a competing pipe line the New York Central made a rate netting 1 cents to the Standard when the open rate was I90 from Cleveland to New York In 1878 the Standard stating they had regularly received 35 cents commission per barrel from the New York Central and 20 cents from the Erie demanded 20 cents per barrel from the Pennsylvania on all oil shipped by these roads and Mr Cassatt granted it after seeing the receipted bills from the other roads This amounted on the Pennsylvania alone in two months to 68753 It had been in existence since October 17 1877 on the other roads20 Another contract gave a Standard Oil Terminal Company 225 cents on all oil transported by the Pennsylvania Co21 In these ways by I879 the Standard had obtained not only control of the local pipe lines but also the terminal facilities of the four trunk lines at Philadelphia Baltimore and New York22 and had obtained control of 90 or 95 per cent of the refining business of the country23 and according to the Hepburn Committee the parties who have been driven to the wall have had ample capital and equal ability in the prosecution 14 3 Indus Cor R 64I 15 Indus

some of its numerous affiliated companies had practically continued to the time of bringing the suit in this case In 1879 a secret trust agreement was entered into by the 37 stockholders of the Standard Oil Company of Ohio whereby the stocks of 30 separate competing companies were turned over to trustees to hold control and manage for the benefit of the stock holders of the Standard This was superseded in 1882 by the Stand ard Oil Trust composed of trustees Forty corporations including those of I879 were taken in their 56000000 of capital stock be ing exchanged by their stockholders with the trustees for 70000000 trust certificates In the ten years after 1882 the stocks of 78 more companies were acquired but 50 refineries had been dismantled in the meantime I2000000 more trust certificates had been issued for these properties and 15000000 more issued as a stock divi dend making 97250000 trust certificates outstanding against prop erty valued at 67936000oo In March 1892 the Supreme Court of Ohio declared the Trust illegal and ordered its dissolution25 At this time the stocks of 84 companies were held by the trustees The trustees of the trust appointed themselves liquidating trustees and proceeded to liquidate in the following way The stock of 23 of these companies was transferred to the Standard Oil Co of New Jersey that of I other companies to the Standard Oil Co of New York that of II other companies to the AngloAmerican Oil Co of England and that of I9 other companies to 7 other corporations leaving the stock of 20 other companies in the hands of the trustees for distribution and these 20 companies by stock ownership con trolled all of the others which had been in the hands of the trustees since there were 972500 trust certificates of Ioo each the

a bare ma jority of all had been exchanged by the trustees with themselves and their immediate associates for their proportional amounts of the stocks in the 20 companies thereby giving them the con

trust but on the testimony of Mr Rockefeller and other high officials of the company that this had been done in good faith and that the 20 companies were com peting this case was dismissed However within a month after filing the suit a large amount of trust certificates was turned in and stock of the subcompanies issued and in I899 the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey was reorganized with a capital stock of Ioooooooo with the power to do all the kinds of business done by all the subcompanies with the same bylaws as those of the trust and with the liquidating trustees as directors the balance of the trust certificates were liquidated at once all of the shares of the 20 subcompanies were then turned over by the shareholders sev eral thousand in number to the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey and exactly 972500 shares of its stock were issued to such shareholders and thereby when the Government brought its suit the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey owned directly the stock of 65 subcompanies which in turn owned the stock of 49 others and of the 972500 shares of the Standard Oil Co of New Jersey the liquidating trustees and their immediate business associates own over 500000 shares the par value of the shares is Ioo the market value at the time of the decision was 672 and has been as high as 843 and for many years dividends from 30 to 48 per cent have been paid Upon the first propositionthat the antitrust act applies only to contracts and combinations in unreasonable restraint of trade the Chief Justice insists that contracts in restraint of trade in the statute means only such as were by the common law in unreasonable restraint of trade as known and understood at the time the law was passed In so holding he reiterates substantially what he said in his dissenting opinion in United States v Freight Association26 This was the suit brought by the Government to dissolve the TransMissouri Freight Association organized for the purpose of maintaining just and reasonable rates preventing unjust discrimin ations by furnishing adequate and equal facilities for the inter change of traffic between the several lines without preventing or illegally limiting competition The case was heard on the plead ings and the answer stating the above facts was admitted to be true The district court RINER J held that such an agreement did 26 I66 U S 335 649MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW not violate the Antitrust Act27 This was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals SANBORN and THAYER JJ SHIRAS J dissent ing28 In the Supreme Court Mr Justice PECKHAM WHITE FIELD GRAY SHIRAS JJ dissenting delivered the opinion and said What is the meaning of the language as used in the Statute that every contract combination in the form of trust or otherwise or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states or with foreign nations is hereby declared to be illegal Is it confined to a contract or combination which is only in unreasonable restraint of trade or commerce or does it include what the language of the act plainly and in terms covers all contracts of that nature    It is now with much amplification of argument urged that the statute in declaring illegal every combination in the form of trust or otherwise or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce does not mean what the language used therein plainly imports but that it only means to declare illegal any such contract which is in unreasonable restraint of trade while leaving all others unaffected by the provisions of the act that the common law meaning of the term contract in restraint of trade includes only such contracts as are in unreasonable restraint of trade and when that term is used in the Federal statute it is not intended to include all contracts in restraint of trade but only those which are in unreasonable re straint ithereof This is exactly the holding of SANBORN and THAYER JJ in the Court of Appeals Justice PECKHAM continues The term is not of such limited signification contracts in restraint of trade have been known and spoken of for hundreds of years both in England and in this country and the term includes all kinds of those contracts which in fact re strain or may restrain trade Some of such contracts have been held void and unenforceable in the courts by reason of their re straint being unreasonable while others have been held valid because they were not of that nature A contract may be in restraint of trade and still be valid at common law Although valid it is never theless a contract in restraint of trade and would be so described either at common law or elsewhere By the simple use of the term contract in restraint of trade all contracts of that nature whether valid or otherwise would be included and not alone that kind of contract which was invalid and unenforceable as being in unreason able restraint of trade When therefore the body of the act pro nounces as illegal every contract or combination in restraint of 27 U S v TransMo Freight Assn I892 53 Fed 440 28 U S v TransMo Freight Assn I893 58 Fed 58 650THE STANDARD OIL DECISION trade or commerce among the several states the plain and ordinary meaning of such language is not limited to that kind of contract alone which is in unreasonable restraint of trade but all contracts are included in such language and no exception or limitation can be added without placing in the act that which has been omitted by Congress In United States v Joint Traffic Assn29 the facts were similar and a reconsideration of the holding in the TransMissouri case was asked on the ground that the Antitrust Act if it made every con tract in restraint of interstate commerce illegal the act was then unconstitutional as depriving persons of their liberty without due process of law The court however overruled this and reaffirmed the view taken in the TransMissouri case Mr Justice PECKHAM again delivered the opinion of the court and GRAY SHIRAS and WHITE JJ dissented The same constitutional point was affirmed in Addyston Pipe and Steel Co v U S30 and also in Montague  Co v Lowrie31 Mr Justice PECKHAM delivering the opinions in both cases In Northern Securities Co v U S 32 the question was again raised Justices HARLAN BROWN MCKENNA and DAY holding that the Antitrust Act embraces all direct restraints reasonable or un reasonable In his concurring opinion Mr Justice BREWER how ever said of the preceding Traffic Association and other cases In stead of holding that the Antitrust Act included all contracts reas onable or unreasonable in restraint of interstate trade the ruling should have been that the contracts there presented were unreason able restraints of interstate trade and as such within the scope of the act    Congress did not intend to reach and destroy those minor contracts in partial restraint of trade which the long course of decisions at common law had affirmed were reasonable and ought to be upheld In this case FULLER C J WHITE PECKHAM HOLMES JJ dissented on the ground that the acquisition and ownership of stock in competing railroads organized under state law by several persons or by corporations is not interstate com merce and therefore not subject to the control of Congress But in Loewe v Lawlor33 Chief Justice FULLER speaking for the whole court without dissent citing the foregoing cases says p 297 they hold in effect that the Antitrust law has a broader application than the prohibition of restraints of trade unlawful at common law 29 I7I U S 556 30 I75 U S 228 1I93 U S 38 32 93 U S I97 33 208 U S 274 65IMICHIGAN LAW REVIEW The road Chief Justice WHITE travels in reaching the conclusion that only unreasonable restraint is forbidden is The text of the first and second sections of the act is Section I Every contract combination in the form of trust or otherwise or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states or with foreign nations is hereby declared to be illegal     Section 2 Every person who shall monopolize or attempt to monopolize or combine or conspire with any person or persons to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several states or with foreign nations shall be deemed guilty of a misde meanor     The debates show that doubt as to whether there was a common law of the United States which governed the subject in the absence of legislation was among the influences leading to the passage of the act They conclusively show however that the main cause which led to the legislation was the thought    that combinations known as trusts were being multiplied and the widespread impres sion that their power had been and would be exerted to oppress individuals and injure the public generally The sole subject with which the first section deals is restraint of trade as therein contemplated and the attempt to monopolize is the subject with which the second section is concerned It is certain that those terms at least in their rudimentary meaning took their origin in the common law and were familiar in the law of this country prior to and at the time of the adoption of the act in ques tion It is certain that at a remote period the words contract in re straint of trade in England came to refer to some voluntary restraint put by contract by an individual on his right to carry on his trade or calling Originally all such contracts were considered to be illegal because it was deemed they were injurious to the public as well as to the individuals who made them In the interest of free dom of individuals to contract this doctrine was modified so that it was only when a restraint by contract was so general as to be coter minous with the kingdom that it was treated as void That is to say if the restraint was partial in its operation and was otherwise reasonable the contract was held to be valid Monopolies were defined by Lord COKE as follows A mon opoly is an institution or allowance by the king by his grant com mission or otherwise to any person or persons bodies politic or corporation of or for the sole buying selling making working or using of any thing whereby any person or persons bodies politic or 652THE STANDARD OIL DECISION corporate are sought to be restrained of any freedom or liberty that they had before or hindered in their lawful trade As monopoly as thus conceived embraced only a consequent arising from an exertion of sovereign power no express restrictions or prohibitions obtained against the creation by an individual of a monopoly as such But as it was considered at least so far as the necessaries of life were concerned that individuals by the abuse of their right of con tract might be able to usurp the power arbitrarily to enhance prices one of the wrongs arising from monopoly it came to be that laws were passed relating to offenses such as forestalling and engrossing by which prohibitions were placed upon the power of individuals to deal under such circumstances and conditions as    to give rise to the presumption of an intent to injure others through the means of a monopolistic increase of prices Hence the prohibited act of engrossing because of its inevitable accomplishment of one of the evils deemed to be engendered by monopoly came to be referred to as being a monopoly or constitut ing an attempt to monopolize From the development of more accurate economic conceptions and the changes in conditions of society it came to be recognized that the acts prohibited by the engrossing forestalling etc statutes did not have the harmful tendency which they were presumed to have when the legislation concerning them was enacted and so such acts were repealed in England in I844 By an early statute of the Province of Massachusetts 7781779 monopoly and forestalling were expressly treated as one and the same It is also true that the principles concerning contracts in restraint of trade that is voluntary restraint put by a person on his right to pursue his calling came generally to be recognized in accordance with the English rule It came moreover to pass that contracts or acts which it was considered had a monopolistic tendency especially those which were thought to unduly diminish competition and hence to enhance pricesin other words to monopolizecame also in a generic sense to be spoken of and treated as they had been in Eng land as restricting the due course of trade and therefore as being in restraint of trade Without going into detail and but briefly surveying the whole field it may be with accuracy said that the dread of enhancement of prices and of other wrongs which it was thought would flow from the undue limitation of competitive conditions caused by con tracts or other acts of individuals or corporations led as a matter of public policy to the prohibition or treating as illegal of contracts 653MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW or acts which were unreasonably restrictive of competitive condi tions either from the nature or character of the contract or act or where the surrounding circumstances were such as to justify the conclusion they had not been entered into or performed with the legitimate purpose of reasonably forwarding personal interest and developing trade but on the contrary were of such a character as to give rise to the inference or presumption that they had been entered into or done with the intent to do wrong to the general public and to limit the right of individuals thus restraining the free flow of commerce and tending to bring about the evils such as enhancement of prices which were considered to be against public policy In view of the common law and the law in this country as to restraint of trade which we have reviewed we think it results as to the first section a That the context manifests that the statute was drawn in the light of the existing practical conception of the law of restraint of trade b That in view of the many new forms of contracts and com binations which were being evolved from existing economic condi tions it was deemed essential by an all embracing enumeration to make sure that no form of contract or combination by which an undue restraint of interstate or foreign commerce was brought about could save such restraint from condemnation c And as the contracts or acts embraced in the provision were not expressly defined since the enumeration addressed itself to classes broad enough to embrace every conceivable contract or combination which could be made concerning trade or commerce or the subjects of such commerce and thus caused any act done by any of the enumerated methods anywhere in the whole field of human activity to be illegal if in restraint of trade it inevitably fol lows that the provision necessarily called for the exercise of judg ment which required that some standard should be resorted to for the purpose of determining whether the prohibitions contained in the statute had or had not in any given case been violated Thus not specifying but indubitably contemplating and requiring a stand ard it follows that it was intended that the standard of reason which had been applied to the common law and in this country in dealing with subjects of the character embraced by the statute was intended to be the measure used for the purpose of determining whether in a given case a particular act had or had not brought about the wrong against which the statute provided And a consideration of the text of the second section serves to establish that it was intended to supplement the first and to make 654THE STANDARD OIL DECISION sure that by no possible guise could the public policy embodied in the first section be frustrated or evaded if possible to make the pro hibitions of the act all the more complete and perfect by embracing all attempts to reach the end prohibited by the first section that is restraints of trade by any attempt to monopolize or monopolization thereof even though the acts by which such results are attempted to be brought about or are brought about be not embraced within the general enumeration of the first section And of course when the second section is thus harmonized with and made as it was intended to be the complement of the first it becomes obvious that the criteria to be resorted to in any given case for the purpose of ascertaining whether violations of the section have been committed is the rule of reason guided by the established law and by the plain duty to enforce the prohibitions of the act and thus the public policy which its restrictions were obviously enacted to subserve In dissenting from this view Mr Justice HARLAN says There are some things in this opinion and some that are to result from this opinion which I think may very well alarm thoughtful men or many thoughtful men and I am unwilling to let them pass with any idea that I approve them The antitrust act of I890 was passed at a time when this country was in a state of great unrest arising out of enormous aggregation of capital in a few hands and arising out of combinations which had their hands upon the throat of this country in respect even to the necessities of life and Congress had before it the great ques tion as to how these evils were to be remedied so far as Congress had the power to remedy them The question was What shall we do They finally after great debate by able statesmen passed the antitrust act of I890 It provides in section I That every con tract combination in form of trust or otherwise or conspiracy not in restraint of trade as the learned chief justice said in one part of his remarks but    in restraint of trade among the several states and with foreign nations is hereby declared to be illegal Congress has nothing to do with domestic trade in the states but as to interstate trade it has a great deal to do and therefore it fell upon this policy The men who were in the Congress of the United States at that time knew what the common law was about the restraint of trade They knew what restraints of trade at common law were lawful and what were unlawful But Congress said The surest way to protect interstate commerce is not to start upon any distinctions at all as to the kinds of trade every contract 655MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW in restraint of trade among the states is hereby declared to be illegal Then in the second section  Every person who shall monopolize or attempt to monopolize or combine or conspire with any other person or persons to monopol izeMonopolize what Any part of interstate trade or commerce shall be liable to the penalties prescribed by this act What be comes then of the statement that this act did not condemn mon opoly in itself Did not these men know what a monopoly was And when Congress said that we will punish any man who monop olizes or attempts to monopolize any part of interstate commerce did it not know what it intended That is not all Every contract combination in form of trust or otherwise or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce among the states is hereby declared illegal Therefore Congress said to all the people of this country We are not going to bother the courts or ourselves with any inquiries as to what contracts are in restraint of trade reasonably or unreason ably We are not going to leave that to any jury We are not going to leave that to any circuit judge We will determine it as a part of the policy of the United States that so far as interstate trade is concerned nobody or corporation shall make or attempt to enforce a contract any contract that in any degree restrains interstate trade Can anybody doubt the meaning of those words    What occurred next Look at this step by step and I shall get directly to the part of this opinion that I say may well alarm the country notwithstanding the many good things that are in it magnificently said In I896 fifteen years ago a case was in this court known as the TransMissouri case The question involved the construction as to the scope and meaning of that antitrust law Who was here to instruct the court on that occasion We hear a good deal about the lamp of reason We hear that the time has come when we should hold up the light of reason and look at this act as if the men of that day freshly after the passage of the act were moving about in darkness and did not know what they were doing or saying Let us see who were the men in the case They were At torney General Harmon W F Guthrie John F Dillon James C Carter Edward J Phelps Lloyd W Bowers and John G John son Justice HARLAN then quotes extensively from this case in cluding the quotations given above He also quotes from the Joint Traffic case showing that that case reaffirmed the TransMissouri case after the fullest argument by the same distinguished attorneys with the help of Senator Edmunds and after the fullest consider ation of the same views of Mr Justice WHITE in his dissenting 656THE STANDARD OIL DECISION opinion and still further after a rehearing for a third time the ma jority of the court held the same He adds If you will take the trouble to look through the Federal Reporter you will find that possibly nearly every Federal court in this country has accepted those original decisions as the final decision of this court as to the meaning of the act of Congress Now it is laid down in some of the cases and it is common sense that this court is bound to know what everybody else in the com munity knows and therefore I say without hesitation that every body knows that there has not been a session of Congress since I896 when that original opinion was delivered but that somebody taking the opposite view from what the court has said has applied to Con gress to get that law amended but it never has been amended and there is not a man in the country today who does not know that it never will be amended by the Congress of the United States to mean what they wanted Congress to have it mean and which Congress refused to have it mean to get the courts so to construe it In the not very short life that I have passed in this capital and the public service of the country the most alarming tendency of this day in my judgment so far as the safety and integrity of our in stitutions are concerned is the tendency to judicial legislation so that when men having vast interests are concerned and they can not get the lawmaking power of the country which controls it to pass the legislation they desire the next thing they do is to raise the question in some caseto get the court so to construe the Constitu tion or the statutes as to mean what they want it to mean That has not been our practice Although it is usually said that debates in a legislative body may not be resorted to to determine the meaning of a statute34 yet the reports of committees may be35 It is however proper for the pur poses of review to look into the proceedings of Congress Section I of the original bill36 introduced by Senator SHERMAN read That all arrangements contracts agreements trusts or combinations between persons or corporations made with a view or which tend to prevent full and free competition in the importation transportation or sale etc and all arrangements contracts agree ments trusts or combinations between persons or corporations de signed or which tend to advance the cost to the consumer of any such articles are hereby declared to be against public policy unlaw ful and void The Senator said It does not announce a new principle of law 34 U S v TransMissouri Frt Assn i66 U  318 35 Church of Holy Trinity v U S 143 U S 457 8 5ISt Cong Ist Sess Dec 4 I889 Senate Bill No I Bills  Debates p 69 657MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW but applies old and well recognized principles of the common law to the complicated jurisdiction of our State and Federal Government Similar contracts in any State in the Union are now by the common or statute law null and void    The purpose of this bill is to enable the courts of the United States to apply the same remedies against combinations which injuriously affect the interests of the United States that have been applied in the several States to pro tect local interests This Section I will enable the Courts of the U S to restrain limit and control such combinations as interfere injuriously with our foreign and interstate commerce to the same extent that the state courts habitually control such combinations as interfere with the commerce of a State This bill as I would have it has for its single object to invoke the aid of the courts of the United States to deal with the combina tions described in the first section when they affect injuriously our foreign and interstate commerce and our revenue laws and in this way to supplement the enforcement of the established rules of the common and statute law by the courts of the several States in deal ing with combinations that affect injuriously the industrial liberty of the citizens of these states This bill does not seek to cripple combinations of capital and labor the formation of partnerships or of corporations but only to prevent and control combinations made with a view to prevent com petition or for the restraint of trade or to increase the profits of the producer at the cost of the consumer It is the unlawful com bination tested by the rules of the common law and human exper ience that is aimed at by this bill and not the lawful and useful combinations The bill does not interfere with any lawful business in the United States whether conducted by a corporation or a partnership or an individual It deals only with unlawful combinations unlawful by the code of any law of any civilized nation of ancient or modern times The Senator further refers to and quotes from the cases referred to below After the bill was debated for several weeks in the Senate it was with numerous proposed amendments referred to the Judi ciary Committee composed of many of the distinguished lawyers of the country37 They reported the bill back in its present form by Senator Edmunds38 Senator HOAR of the committee said We have affirmed the old doctrine of the common law in regard 37 Bills  Debates p 303 38 Ib 306 658THE STANDARD OIL DECISION to all interstate and international commercial transactions and have clothed the United States courts with authority to enforce that doc trine by injunction We have put in also a grave penalty39 And Senator EDMUNDS said We would frame a bill that should be clearly within our Constitutional power that we should make its definition out of terms that were well known to the law already and would leave it to the courts in the first instance to say how far they could carry it or its definitions as applicable to each particular case as it might arise40 And Senator EDMUNDS said in reference to monopoly that we studied it with whatever little ability we had and the best answer I can make is to read from Websters Dictionary the definition of the verb to monopolize I To purchase or obtain possession of the whole of as a commodity or goods in market with the view to ap propriate or control the exclusive sale of as to monopolize sugar or tea Like the Sugar Trust One man if he had capital enough could do it just as well as two 2 To engross or obtain by any means the exclusive right of especially the right of trading to any place or within any country or district as to monopolize the India or Levant trade The old definition    We thought we had done the right thing in providing in the very phrase we did that if one person instead of two by a combination if one person alone as we have heard about the wheat market in Chicago for instance did it it was just as offensive and injurious to the public interests as if two had combined to do it41 Senator EDMUNDS definition of monopoly should be noted es pecially the firstpurchase of the whole commodity to control its sale He as does the Chief Justice assumes that the second defini tion given is the old one this is a mistake it only goes back to Lord COKE the other the first one back to ARISTOTLEand literally means a sole seller ARISTOTLE says Thales the Milesian phil osopher was reproached for his poverty but he knew by his skill in the stars while it was yet winter that there would be a great harvest of olives in the coming year so having a little money he gave deposits for the use of all the olivepresses in Chios and Miletus which he hired at a low price because no one bid against him When the harvesttime came and many wanted them all at once and of a sudden he let them out at any rate he pleased and made a quantity of money He is supposed to have given striking proof of his wisdom but as I was saying his device for getting money is noth ing but the creation of a monopoly 89Ib 311 40 Ib 315 1 Ib p 324 659MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW So too there was a man of Sicily who having money deposited with him bought up all the iron from the iron mines afterwards when the merchants from their various markets came to buy he was the only seller and without much increasing the price he gained 200 per cent Which when Dionysius heard he told him he might take away his money but that he must not remain in Syracuse He had the same idea as Thales they both contrived to create a monop oly for themselves And statesmen ought to know these things42 The foregoing statements seem to confirm the view of the Chief Justice this however is only apparent and a careful study of the debates leads to a different view I Senator SHERMANS original bill was aimed at all arrangements contracts etc made with a view or which tend to prevent full and free competition in inter state and foreign commerce it made these illegal null and void 2 He pointed out that the purchase of property by one person of another the formation of partnerships or corporations to aid pro duction are not combinations which prevent competition in the legal sensethey are not contracts in restraint of trade within the mean ing of the common law 3 He cited cases that all combinations for the purpose of raising or controlling prices of merchandise or any of the necessaries of life are monopoliesmatches here and it is no answer to say that it has reduced the price for it can at any time raise the price to an exorbitant degree 43 a secret partner ship among the grain dealers in a towneach firm apparently con ducting its own business as if no such partnership existedto con trol the price of grain costs of storage and expense of shipment at such town is in restraint of trade and void 44 the division of the city of Chicago by agreement between two gas companies allowing each the exclusive right of supplying gas therein for Ioo years and stipu lating that neither would interfere with the business of the other in its own territory although it involved a partial restraint of trade was void as between corporations engaged in a public business in which the public have an interest45 and the purchase of a majority of the capital stock of the four competing gas companies in Chicago by a new corporation incorporated for the manufacture sale and distribution of gas and to purchase and hold the capital stock of any gas company in Chicago or elsewhere builds up a virtual monop oly in the manufacture and sale of gas which is unlawful and the corporation can be dissolved 4 and any combination the tendency 42 Politics Bk I 4 Richardson v Buhl I889 77 Mich 632 Craft v McConoughy I875 79 ill 346 45 Chicago Gas L Co v Peoples Gas L Co 121 Ill 53I People v Chicago Gas Trust Co I889 130 Ill 268 66oTHE STANDARD OIL DECISION of which is to prevent competition in its broad and general sense and thus at will enhance prices to the detriment of the public is a legal monopoly47 4 These views were not controverted denied or questioned but seemed to be taken for granted by all And furth er the debates seem to assume that for practical purposes any con tract made with the view and directly tending to prevent full and free competition in interstate commerce since it would affect the people of at least two states and might all of themwould be in herently in unreasonable restraint of trade by the rules of the com mon law 5 But the Senator also proposed that the policy of the States not only as indicated by the decisions but by their statutes as well making these things criminal and tortious should be supple mented by adopting a like policy by the Federal government in reference to interstate and foreign commerce 6 The debate was mostly upon the remedies for these wrongsshould they be made criminal should they be enjoined at the suit of the United States should a person not a party to the restraining contract have a civil remedy for the damage done him or should these things be held null void and unenforcible by the parties to them as at common law No one proposed the latter alone but all desired to provide one or more of the other remedies and this is why the original bill was referred to the Judiciary Committee and why it reported the bill in its present formto extend the policy of the states to inter state and foreign commerceto make violations thereof criminal clothe the Federal courts with power to enforce this policy by in junction and give a civil remedy to a person injured by its violation 7 So too because the bill said nothing about monopoly and would not prevent cornering the market was another objection to it hence the judiciary committee added the monopoly section If this is correct then it seems probable that every contract was deliberately used to mean what it says and this seems to be more than confirmed by the subsequent history set forth in Justice HAR LAN S opinion It is not quite clear therefore why the court should in a case not requiring it and when the question was touched upon only incidently in the briefsbecause it had been considered practically settled for fifteenyears suddenly reverse itself and mount that unruly horse public policywhich no court has ever yet successfully ridden and which will vary as it has heretofore in matters of this kind on the equity side with the length of the chancellors foot and on the legal side from Hulls per Dieu if the plaintiff were here he should go to prison till he paid a fine to the King because he took a bond 47 Mr Justice Barrett in People v North River Sugar Ref Co 2 Abb N C I64 66IMICHIGAN LAW REVIEW from a dyer not to use his dyers craft in town for half a year48 to the House of Lords conclusion that a combination to engross all the tea trade between Shanghai and Europe to the exclusion of the plaintiff was not unlawfulso as to give the plaintiff an action for damages49 the court here however was careful to point out that while this was a contract in restraint of trade it was not unlawful so as to give a third party an action for damages they did not hold that it was a contract in reasonable restraint of trade so that one party to it would have had an action against another for damages for refusing to abide by it they probably would have refused to enforce it so because it was in unreasonable restraint of trade50 And it is safe to say that had the case arisen before 1844 the court would hardly have held under the laissez faire rule of reason so fashionable at the time that the English statutes did not apply as they before had been interpreted It would have been left to Par liament as it was to abrogate the statutes and establish a new policy However if hereafter the common law rule of reason is to apply and though this will lead to a sea of uncertainty if one can judge by the conflict in the views of the members of the court perhaps the ultimate result will not be greatly different except to throw a greater burden on the government in getting at and establishing the facts in each case There is not much in the common law rule of reason except its uncertainty to give comfort to any of the large trusts to classify themselves among the sheep instead of among the goats The best statement of the common law so far as it can be stated at all is that made by President TAFT when as judge he rendered the decision in the Addyston Pipe Case5l He said citing cases in the note Covenants in partial restraint of trade are generally upheld as valid when they are agreements I by the seller of property or business not to compete with the buyer in such a way as to derogate from the value of property or business sold 2 by a retiring part ner not to compete with the firm 3 by a partner pending the part nership not to do anything to interfere by competition or otherwise with the business of the firm 4 by the buyer of property not to use the same in competition with the business retained by the seller and 5 by an assistant servant or agent not to compete with his master or employer after the expiration of his time of service Be fore such agreements are upheld however the court must find that the restraints attempted thereby are reasonably necessary I 2 and 3 to the enjoyment by the buyer of the property goodwill or in 48 Diers Case I415 Y B 2 H V f 5 pl 26 49 Mogul Steamship Co v McGregor

business caused by the unjust use on the part of the em ploye of the confidential knowledge acquired in such business2 But where the sole object of both parties in making the contract as expressed therein is merely to restrain competition and enhance or maintain prices it would seem that there was nothing to justify or excuse the restraint that it would necessarily have a tendency to monopoly and therefore would be void In such a case there is no measure of what is necessary to the protection of either party except the vague and varying opinion of judges as to how much on prin ciples of political economy men ought to be allowed to restrain competition There is in such contracts no main lawful purpose to subserve which partial restraint is permitted and by which its reas onableness is measured but the sole object is to restrain trade in order to avoid the competition which it has always been the policy of the common law to foster53 52 First class Mitchel v ReynoldsI P Wms I8I Fowle

be summarized and classified as follows I Purchase or acquisi tion of stock of competing corporations by one of the competitors for the purpose of preventing competition or creating a monopoly Of this class are the Sugar Trust cases In the Knight case55 the American Sugar Refinery Company being in control of a large part of the manufactories of refined sugar in the United States purchased all the stock of fourcompeting Philadelphia sugar re fineries giving the American Co a practical monopoly of the re fining and sale of sugar in the United States it was held by FULLER C J that conceding the

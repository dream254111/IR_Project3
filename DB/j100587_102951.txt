CONCERNING THE FLESH OF WHALES CRYSTALINC HUMOUR OF THE EYE OF WHALES FISH AND OTHER CREA TURES AND OF THE USE OF THE EYELIDS DELFT IN HOLLAND JULY 22 1704 I TAKE THE LIBERTY TO COMMUNICATE THESE MY OBSERVA TIONS WHICH I MADE LAST YEAR WHEN OUR SHIPS RETURND FROM THE WHALE FISHERY I HAVE OFTEN CONCLUDED THAT THE GLOBULES OF BLOOD WHICH ARE THE CAUSE OF ITS REDNESS ARE OF THE SAME MAGNITUDE BOTH IN GREAT AND SMALL ANIMALS AND CON SEQUENTLY THAT THE PARTICLES OF BLOOD IN A WHALE ARE NO LARGER THAN IN ANOTHER FISH NO BIGGER THAN A PIN NOT BEING ABLE TO GET AT ANY WHALES BLOOD I WAS FORCD TO ACQUIESCE IN BARE SPECULATIONS FROM THE PARTICLES OF BLOOD MY THOUGHTS WANDERD TO THOSE OF THE FLESH OF A WHALE WHEREUPON I DESIRD SOME THAT WERE CONCERND IN THE FISHING TO BRING ME A PIECE OF WHALES FLESH IMAGINING THAT THE FLESHPARTICLES OF THE SAID FISH WERE NO BIGGER THAN THOSE OF A HORSE OR COW AND THAT THE BULK OR LARGENESS OF A WHALE CONSISTED ONLY IN THE MULTITUDE OF NUMBER OF PARTICLES THE PIECE OF WHALES FLESH WHICH WAS BROUGHT ME HAD NO VERY GOOD SMELL BY REASON OF ITS BEING ALMOST PUTRI FYD I CUT IT THRO CROSSWAYS IN ORDER TO SEPARATE THE FLESHPARTICLES ACCORDING TO THEIR LENGTH AND I MUST OWN THAT ACCORDING TO THE BEST OF MY JUDGMENT I COULD DIS COVER NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SAID PARTICLES IN THEIR SIGHT AND THOSE OF A LARGE OX THE REASON WHY I COMPARE A WHALE WITH A GREAT OX IS BECAUSE I IMAGIN THAT THE FIBRES IN A GREAT OX ARE K K K K K K K K K K NOT1724 NOT MORE THAN THOSE OF A SMALL ONE NAY EVEN IN A CALF I DONT THINK THAT THE FIBRES ARE FEWER IN NUMBER BUT ONLY THAT THEY ENCREASE IN BIGNESS A CERTAIN LABOURER PRESENTED ME WITH THE CHRISTALINE HUMOUR OF A WHALES EYE WHICH HE CALLD THE EYE OF THAT FISH AND TOLD ME THAT ONE OF HIS NEIGHBOURS LATELY RETURND FROM THE WHALEFISHING HAD BROUGHT IT HOME WITH HIM AFTER WHICH THE HEER FREDERIC WOLFERT VAN OVERSCHIEBY THE INTEREST HE HAD IN ONE OF THE COMMANDERS OF A GREEN LAND SHIP LATELY RETURND FROM THE SAID FISHING PROCURD ME TWO OF THE HUMOR CRISTALINUS OF THE SAME FISH ONE WAS OF A GREAT AND THE OTHER OF A SMALL WHALE SUPPOSING THAT I SHOULD BE GLAD TO MAKE SOME REMARKS ON THE SAID HUMORS OF THESE TWO CRISTALINE HUMORS I DISSECTED THE SMALLEST AND KEPT THE LARGEST ENTIRE TAB 1 FIG 1 A B REPRESENTS THE BIGNESS OF THE SAID CRISTALINE HUMOUR WHEN IT CAME INTO MY HANDS THO I BE LIEVE IT WAS SOMETHING LARGER WHEN IT WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE WHALES EYE FOR I HAVE OBSERVD THAT WHEN I HAVE TAKEN THE CRISTALINE HUMOR OUT OF THE CODS EYE AND LAID IT NEVER SO GENTLY DOWN BY REASON OF ITS SOFTNESS SOME OF ITS SUBSTANCE FELL FROM IT THE WHICH HAVING TAKEN AND VIEWD WITH MY GLASSES I COULD STILL DISCOVER IN IT THE FIBROUS MATTER OF WHICH IT CONSISTED HOW MUCH MORE THEN MUST SUCH A HUMOR OF THE WHALES EYE DIMINISH BY BEING PRESERVED IN SAWDUST IN ORDER TO KEEP IT STIFF AND HARD THE REASON WHY SOME OF THE SEAFARING PEOPLE TAKE SUCH PAINS TO BRING HOME WITH EM THE CRISTALINE HUMOR OF A WHALES EYE IS TO SHOW IT AS A WONDER THAT SO GREAT AN ANIMAL SHOULD HAVE SO SMALL AN EYE FOR THEY MISTAKE THAT HUMOR FOR THE WHOLE EYE IN EXAMINING THE SAID CRISTALINE HUMOR IT APPEARD TO ME THAT THE FIBROUS MATTER OR PARTICLES WHEREOF IT IS COM1725 COMPOSED LAY SO VERY THIN UPON ONE ANOTHER MAKING THEREBY SUCH EXCEEDING FINE SCALES THAT LAY SO PRODIGI OUSLY THICK UPON ONE ANOTHER THAT IT WAS AMAZING TO BEHOLD AND THIS FIBROUS SUBSTANCE IS THINNER OF PARTI CLES THAN THAT OF A PEARCH NOT A YEAR OLD THE REASON WHY THE FIBROUS MATTER OF THE CRISTALINE HUMOUR OF A SMALL PEARCH APPEARS THICKER THAN THAT IN A WHALE IS THAT WE SEE THE FORMER ON ONE SIDE WHERE THE THREADS OR FIBRES ARE THICKEST BUT IF WE VIEW THEM WHERE THE FIBROUS PARTICLES MEET TOGETHER THEY ARE EX CEEDING FINE OR SLENDER WHEREAS ON THE CONTRARY THE FIBROUS MATTER OF THE WHALE NOT MEETING TOGETHER BUT RUNNING BY BY CROSSING ITSELF OFTEN IS OF THE SAME THICK NESS THROUGHOUT IN MY LETTER OF THE 14TH OF APRIL 1684 TO THE HO NORABLE SOCIETY I IMPARTED MY DISCOVERIES ABOUT THE CRISTALINE HUMOR OF AN OX FISH C AND PARTICULARLY I COMMUNICATED THE COURSE OF THE FIBROUS MATTER IN THE SAID HUMOR AND I HAVE DISCOVERD THAT THE CRISTALLIN HUMOR IN A WHALE IS OF A QUITE DIFFERENT TEXTURE OR CIRCUMVOLUTION FROM THE FIBROUS MATTER IN MANY CREA TURES FOR WHEREAS THE SAID HUMOR IN OTHERS CONSISTS OF THREE PARTICULAR CONJOYND BRANCHES ALL ARISING OUT OF ONE POINT THE SAME HUMOR IN THE EYE OF A WHALE IS COMPOSED OF FIVE CIRCUMVOLUTIONS ALL WHICH UNITE TOGE THER IN ONE POINT AND MAKE ONE SCALE BUT I MUST HERE CAUTION YOU THAT I ONLY SPEAK OF THE HALF OF THAT ORB OF THE CRISTALINE HUMOR WHICH FELL IMMEDIATELY UNDER MY OBSERVATION NOW TO DESCRIBE THE SMALLNESS AS WELL AS THE FIBROUS CONTEXTURE OF WHICH SUCH A SCALE CONSISTS AND WHEREOF MANY LYING UPON ONE ANOTHER COMPOSE THE CRISTALINE HU MOUR I CAUSD ONE OF EM TO BE DESIGND FIG 2 C D E F SHEWS A SMALL PARTICLE OF THE CRISTA LINE HUMOR OF A WHALES EYE TAKEN OFF FROM THE GLOBU K K K K K K K K K K 2 LAR1726 LAR PART THE REAL BIGNESS OF WHICH AS IT APPEARED TO THE NAKED EYE IS REPRESENTED IN FIG 3 BY G H AT FIRST I DID NOT BELIEVE THAT I SHOULD HAVE ATTAIND MY END WHICH WAS SO TO DISCOVER THE TEXTURE OF THE FIBRES AS TO BE ABLE TO EXPOSE THE EXACT CIRCUMVOLUTION TO MY OWN VIEW BY REASON THAT THE SCALY PARTICLES WERE DRYD TOGETHER SO HARD THAT THEY WERE AS CLEAR AS GLASS BUT WHEN I HAD DISSECTED THE SECOND CRISTALIN HUMOR AFTER THE MANNER AS YOU MAY SEE IN FIG 3 G H I COULD PERCEIVE IT VERY EASILY THE ABOVEMENTIOND LITTLE PARTICLE FIG 2 C D E F APPEARD NO BIGGER TO THE NAKED EYE THAN FIG 4 I K IN WHICH BY THE HELP OF MY MICROSCOPE I COULD DISCOVER THE EXCEEDING FINE THREADS WHICH I CALL THE FIBROUS MATTER WITH A PART OF THE CIRCUMVOLUTION WHICH COM POSE A FIFTH PART OR DIVISION OF THE HEMISPHERE OF THE SAID CRISTALLIN HUMOR MAY WE NOT BE AMAZED WITH THE SIGHT OF SUCH A CON TEXTURE OF WHICH THE PAINTER SAID IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO TRACE THE EXCEEDING FINE AND REGULAR FIBRES WITH THE REDLEAD PENCIL BUT HOPED TO BE A LITTLE MORE EXACT WHEN HE SHOULD COME TO DESCRIBE THE SAME WITH HIS GRAVINGIRON ON A COPPER PLATE THESE SCALY PARTICLES DONT LYE THICKER ON EACH OTHER THAN THE THREADS OR FIBROUS MATTER ARE REPRESENTED IN THE LAST MENTIOND FIGURE LET US BUT IMAGINE THEN HOW CLOSELY THESE PARTICLES LYING UPON AND NEAR EACH OTHER MUST BE UNITED FOR OTHERWISE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE HUMOR CRISTALINUS TO HAVE SUCH A TRANSPARENCY AS THE NATURE OF THAT BODY REQUIRES NOW IN ORDER TO HAVE A CLEARER IDEA OF THE COURSE OF THE FIBROUS MATTER IN THE CRISTALINE HUMOR OF A WHALES EYE WHICH FIBRES AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE LYE IN SO MANY FOLDS UPON EACH OTHER I TOOK A COMMON BALL FOR I COULD NOT MAKE THE PAINTER COMPREHEND IT ANY OTHER WAY AND DIVIDED IT INTO SUCH PARTS AS WERE ANA INFERREDLOGOUSINFERRED1727 LOGOUS OR CORRESPONDED WITH THE DIVISIONS OF THE FI BROUS MATTER IN THE CRISTALLIN HUMOR AND THEN WOUND IT ABOUT WITH A SINGLE SMALL THREAD WHICH WAS TO RE PRESENT THE FIBROUS MATTER THAT COMPOSD A SMALL SCALE OF THE SAID HUMOR FIG 5 A B C D E F G H I K REPRESENTS A GLOBE OR ORB OF THE CRISTALLINE HUMOR OF A WHALE WHEREOF L IS THE CENTER OR AXIS AND LIES NEXT TO THE VIEW WHERE THE FIBROUS PARTICLES ARISE OUT OF THE SHORTEST CIRCUMVOLUTION OF THE OPPOSIT PART OF THE GLOBE AND THE COURSE OF WHICH IS IN SOME MEASURE DESCRIBED BY THE LETTERS L A L C L E L G AND L I AS FOR THE FIBROUS SUBSTANCE WHICH HERE DOES FIRST CIRCUMVOLVE FROM THE MIDDLE POINT OR CENTER VIZ Q B P D O F N H AND M K THEY DESCRIBE THE SAME CIR CUMVOLUTION IN THE OPPOSITE PART OF THE SPHERE OR GLOBE WHICH IS HERE REPRESENTED BY L THEN I CAUSED THE PAINTER TO DESIGN THE SAID BALL THAT WAS WOUND ABOUT WITH A THREAD ON ONE SIDE THAT YOU MAY THE BETTER CONCEIVE THE CIRCUMVOLUTION OF THE FI BROUS MATTER FIG 6 R S T U REPRESENTS THE SAID BALL SO WELL WOUND UP IN THE SINGLE THREAD THAT THERE APPEARD ONLY THE TWO ENDS OF THE SAID THREAD AND THE BALL WAS SO WELL COVERD THAT HARDLY ANY OF THE LEATHER APPEARD THE CENTER OR AXIS WHICH IN FIG 5 IS DESCRIBD BY L WHERE THE FIBROUS MATTER PROCEEDING FIVE SEVERAL WAYS DOES CIRCUMVOLVE AS A L C C L E E L G AND G L I WE MUST SUPPOSE TO BE REPRESENTED IN THIS FIGURE BY R AND T IN FIGURE 5 WE HAVE DESCRIBD FIVE OTHER BUT SHORTER CIRCUMVOLUTIONS OF THE FRIBROUS SUBSTANCE AS IS BEFORE SAID BY THE LETTERS M N O P Q BUT WHEN WE HAD CAUSED FIG 6 TO BE DESIGND THERE APPEARD BUT THREE OF THE LAST MENTIOND CIRCUMVOLUTIONS AS IN THE LETTERS W X Y AND1728 AND HERE AGAIN THE UNCONCEIVABLE ORDER AND THE WIS DOM OF THE GREAT CREATOR OF ALL THINGS IS VERY OBVIOUS FOR WHAT MAN IS THERE IN THE WORLD THAT COULD WIND A BOUT A GLOBE OR BALL WITH A SINGLE THREAD OF EQUAL SIZE THROUGHOUT AND NOT CROSS IT SELF IN ANY POINT AND YET SUCH IS THE CONTEXTURE OF THE FILAMENTS OR FIBROUS MAT TER OF WHICH THE SCALES OF THE CRISTALINE HUMOUR OF A WHALE ARE COMPOSD WHEN I TALKT WITH THE LATE HEER CHRISTIAN HUYGENS OF ZUBICHEM ABOUT THE CRISTALINE HUMOURS IN THE EYES OF FISHES TO WIT ABOUT THE SPHERICAL FIGURE THEREOF HIS ANSWER WAS WHAT SHALL WE SAY THE EYES OF THE FISHES ARE OF A WONDERFUL FORM SINCE WHICHHAVING CAREFULLY OBSERVD THE EYES OF SEVE RAL FISHESAND PARTICULARLY THE TUNICA CORNEA THEREOF I FOUND THAT THE SAID TUNICOR RATHER THE PUPIL OR APPLE OF THE EYE WAS VERY FLAT LIKE THOSE IN HUMAN CREATURES AND OTHER ANIMALS FROM WHENCE I CONCLUDEDTHAT THO THE CRISTALINE HUMOUR IN FISHES WAS SPHERICAL YET THE SAME WAS MADE GOOD BY THE FLATNESS OF THE APPLE OF THE EYE IN THE SAME FISHES FROM WHENCE ONE MIGHT PROBABLY CONCLUDE THAT THE EYES OF FISHES ARE OF THE SAME CONTEXTURE WITH OTHER LANDCREATURES AND CONSEQUENTLY THE EFFECTS IN BOTH ARE THE SAME FOR IF YOU OBSERVE THE SPHERICALNESS OF THE AP PLE OF THE EYE IN MEN IT WILL BE FOUND TO BE A LARGE EYE WHERE THE TUNICA CORNEA MAKES A CIRCLE WHOSE AXIS IS AN INCH LONG WHEN I HAD TAKEN THE EYE OUT OF THE HEAD OF A LIVING CODFISH AND PUT THE TUNICA CORNEA IN SEVERAL COPPER GLOBES OR INTERNAL CIRCLES IT APPEARED TO ME THAT THE PROTUBERANT ROUNDNESS OF THE SAID TUNIC WAS EQUAL TO THE SEGMENT OF A CIRCLE WHOSE DIAMETER WAS OF TWO INCHES THE SAID EYE WAS A LITTLE PROMINENT OUT OF THE HEAD LIKE THOSE OF OTHER CREATURES AND THO THE TUNICS OR AP PLES MAKE A LARGER CIRCLE YET ARE THEY NOT BIGGER AND THE AXIS OF THE CRISTALINE HUMOUR WAS A LITTLE LONGER THAN HALF AN INCH NOW1729 NOW IF THE CRISTALINE HUMOUR WHICH I HAVE SOME TIMES CALLD THE CRIST MUSCLE IN OUR EYES AND IN MANY OTHER CREATURES CONSISTS OF A FLATTISH ROUNDNESS BUT IS NOT PERFECTLY SPHERICAL AND IF THE DIAMETER OF THE CIRCLE MADE BY THE TUNICK OF THE SAID EYES BE AN INCH LONG THE CRISTALINE HUMOUR IN FISHES BEING SPHERICAL AND THEIR TUNICK DESCRIBING A CIRCLE WHOSE DIAMETER IS TWO INCHES ALL THESE EYES AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE MAY HAVE THE SAME EFFECT AFTER THIS I TOOK A WHITING WHICH WEIGHD ABOUT 9 OUNCES AND EXAMIND THE EYE THEREOF WHICH DESCRIBD A CIRCLE OF 1 AND 12 INCH IN DIAMETER AND THE DIAMETER OF ITS CRISTALINE HUMOUR WAS VERY NEAR 13 OF AN INCH WHEN I DISSECTED THE CRISTALINE HUMOUR OF A SMALL FISH AND FOUND THE INMOST PART THEREOF NO BIGGER THAN A LARGE CORN OF SAND I OBSERVD THAT THE FIBROUS PARTICLES OF WHICH THOSE EXCEEDING SMALL SCALES WERE COMPOSD DID CONSIST OF AS MANY PARTS AS THE UPPERMOST SCALES OF THE SAME HUMOUR I DID FORMERLY RESOLVE TO MAKE A STRICTER ENQUITY INTO THE EYES OF FISHES BUT MET WITH SO MANY OBSTACLES THAT I COUD NOT GO THROUGH WITH MY OBSERVATIONS WHICH MADE ME DELAY THEM TILL NOW NOW I AM SPEAKING OF EYES I CANT FORBEAR ADDING THAT A CERTAIN GENTLEMAN ASKT ME SOME TIME SINCE WHY NATURE HAS GIVEN US EYELIDS SEEING THAT FISHES HAVE NONE AND THAT HIS SURGEON COULD NOT TELL HIM THE REA SON I ANSWERD THAT IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR INFERREDUSINFERRED AND ALL LANDANIMALS TO HAVE EYELIDS FOR IF IT WERE NOT SO AND THAT THE APPLE OF OUR EYES WERE NOT MOISTNED MANY TIMES IN THE SPACE OF AN HOUR AND ALL THE FOULNESS THAT MIGHT FALL THEREON WASHT AWAY OUR SIGHT OR THE TUNICA CORNEA WOULD BE SO CLOGGD WITH FILTH THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO USE OUR EYES BESIDES THE SAID TUNIC WOULD OTHERWISE BE PARCHT UP OR SHRUNK WITH HEAT AND CONSEQUENTLY WE SHOULD BECOME BLIND WHERE  INFERREDASINFERRED1730 AS ON THE CONTRARY FISHES LIVING ALWAYS IN WATER WANT NO EYELIDS BECAUSE THE SAME WATER KEEPS THEIR EYES EVER MOIST AND CLEAN WITH WHICH ANSWER THE GEN TLEMAN WAS SATISFYD BUT I HAVE SINCE FOUND THAT I WAS OUT IN MY ASSERTION FOR FLOUNDERS PLAISE SOLES AND I BELIEVE ALL FLAT FISHES CAN COVER THEIR EYES AND IF THEY HAD NOT I FANCY THEY WOULD LOSE THEIR SIGHT BECAUSE THE SAID SORT OF FISH ARE NOT SO NIMBLE AS OTHERS IN SWIMMING BEING ONLY ABLE TO MOVE THEIR TAILS THE CHIEF INSTRU MENTS OF SPEED UPWARDS AND DOWNWARDS WHEREFORE THESE FISHES IN A STORM DONT BETAKE THEMSELVES TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA AS I AM INFORMD BUT DIG THEMSELVES HOLES IN THE SAND WHICH SECURES THEM FROM BEING CAST UPON THE BEACH OR STRAND NOW IF THEY HAD NOT EYE LIDS THE SHARP POINTS OF SAND WHILST THEY ARE MAKING THEIR NEST WOULD WOUND THE TUNICKS OF THEIR EYES WHEREBY THE TRANSPARENCY THEREOF WOULD BE DESTROYD AND THE FISHES BECOME BLIND WHICH IS A FARTHER PROOF HOW PERFECT EVERY CREATARE IS IN ITS OWN SPECIES I CON CLUDE C

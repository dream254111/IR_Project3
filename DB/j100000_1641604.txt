call attention to a few additional facts regarding its unique fitness to be bur national emblem and the support it has already re ceived A history of earlier efforts in The National Flower Movement is given by the present writer in the Transactions of the Massachusetts Horticultural Society Part I 1898 where will also be found a full discussion of the merits of various candidates The idea of having our native columbine for national flower occurred independently to several persons during the time of preparation for the Columbian Exposition at Chicago and in 1895 there was organized the Columbine Association whose object is by spreading in formation of its fitness to bring about the official adoption of the columbine as the na tional flower of the United States The fol lowing year a National Flower Convention composed of delegates from the various states of the Union chosen by their respective gov ernors at the request of Governor Elias Carr of North Carolina met from the twentyfirst to the twentythird of October at Asheville to decide upon the most suitable flower for our national emblem With a view to helping future decision it was unanimously Resolved That a plant to serve properly the pur poses of a national flower should meet the following conditions 1 It should be a native of the United States and should grow wild over the greater part of its area 2 It should bloom on one or more of our national holidays 3 It should be capable of easy cultivation in any garden 4 It should not be a weed or in any way offen sive or harmful to health 5 It should bear what in the popular sense is called a flower and should not be merely a foliage plant or one chiefly valued for its fruit 611N S VOL XLVII No 1225 6 It should lend itself readily to floral decora tion by variety and purity of color and distinctive ness of form 7 The features characteristic of its form should combine such simplicity and gracefulness that when used conventionally in decorative design the flower may be readily recognized independently of its color 8 It should be a flower which has never been used by any other people as their emblem and not resemble such a flower in general form 9 It should possess if possible patriotic asso ciations plainly connecting it with the best for which our country stands among the nations of the world While the convention deemed it inexpedient to make any recommendation of a special flower at that time it was evidently the sense of a majority of the delegates present as shown by an informal vote that the colum bine or aquilegia sometimes known as wild honeysuckle is the only flower which meets the requirements set forth in the above res olution Beside the columbines qualifications ad vanced by Mr Hansen the following are note worthy Shortspurred forms of the flower native to our Rocky Mountains and to the home of Columbus resemble so closely a group of doves that the flowers namelike that of the great discoverer and our national title Columbiais derived from the Latin columba a dove Thus the same flower which rides our mountain storms like an American eagle becomes in quiet valleys a doveflower symbolizing peace One of its shortspurred nectaries bears remarkable resemblance to a libertycap those of moderate length are min iature horns of plenty and the longest are golden trumpets proclaiming Columbias ideal of liberty whence comes the peace that makes for plenty the plenty that makes for power and the power that makes for peace A colum bine leaf with its many leaflets in organic union the leader among them having thirteen lobes aptly recalls that mutual loyalty which the founders of our thirteen original states implied in their motto e pluribus unum FREDERICK LEROY SARGENT CAMBRIDGE MASS THE article on the above subject in the April 12 number of SCIENCE is timely inas much as if we do not hurry all the best flowers will be selected ahead of the nation Even the one Mr Albert A Hansen proposes has already been preempted by Colorado The Aquilegia canadensis is a charming spring flower well worthy the compliment he pays it but I will mention a few objections In the first place it would be a trespass upon that states rights to select their flower espe cially when there are so many others to choose from Then its name canadensis indicates that is was first made known from Canada which is no part of America as we wish it to be known the U S A The chief objection to the wild columbine is that it falls to pieces so readily This prevents it from being a valuable addition to a bouquet or for decora tion After the petals have fallen only the ragged follicles remain Nor is it extremely common in this part of the country the speci mens I have growing in my garden coming from a start procured with some difficulty Some years ago the goldenrod was proposed for the national flower of America and I have often wished that it might be adopted There are 47 distinct species of this plant mentioned in Britton and Browns Flora almost as many as the states in the Union Perhaps one or two more may be discovered to make the number exact All are of the same color yellow like sunshine symbolic of cheerfulness The goldenrod belongs to the Composites the many in one family of flowers and its bo tanical name Solidago means to make whole It is a universal plant in this country and one species Solidago juncea blooms from June into November This is a handsome variety and bears cultivation as do most of them Columbias flower the goldenrod on hill and val ley grows The gold is for the one who earns the rod is for her foes KATHARINE DOORIS SHARP LONDON OHIO SCIENTIFIC BOOKS

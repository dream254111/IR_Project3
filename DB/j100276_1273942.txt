in the language of the principal case It is a mere expectancy of an unas certainable value    INTERSTATE COMMERCEREGULATION OF BY STATE STATUTiPlaintiff sender of an interstate telegram recovered damages in the Circuit Court to the amount of loss sustained for negligent nondelivery By his contract with the telegraph company he could recover only the cost of the message A statute of the state provided that for such negligent nondelivery a telegraph company shall be liable to the amount of loss Held the contract was void under the statute and that the statute was not a regulation of interstate commerce Commercial Milling Co v Western Union Telegraph Co 1908  Mich  II5 N W Rep 698 The court divided evenly as to whether or not the statute was a regulation of commerce A similar statute was held in Texas to be invalid as a regulation of interstate commerce Western Union Telegraph Co v Burgess 43 S W I033 These cases illustrate a tendency in some state courts to overlook the distinction between direct regulation of commerce and those indirect and incidental acts which affect it but slightly Cooley v Port Wardens 12 How 299 They apparently consider any state action at all relative to interstate commerce as invalid and extend the exclusive control of the United States Government over that subject farther than the laws of Congress or the decisions of the Supreme Court seem to require In this connection the Supreme Court in Tel Co v Hughes I9I U S 477 24 Sup Ct Rep 132 speaking through Justice DAY says There is no sanction of agreements of this character limiting liability to stipulated valuations and until Congress shall legislate upon it is there any valid objection to the state enforcing its own regulations upon the subject though it may to this extent indirectly affect interstate commerce contracts of carriage The right of a common carrier at common law to limit his liability for negligence by contract has been variously interpreted in the several states and in several the rule as declared by the courts has been changed by statute Recovery in such cases has for many years depended upon the forum to which the plaintiff might or must resort and in no case has a rule of interpretation of any state been considered by the Supreme Court as a regulation of commerce The statute referred to in the principal case merely reversed the common law rule as previously declared by the Michigan court W U Tel Co v Carew 15 Mich 525 Jacobs v W U Tel Co I35 Mich 600 98 N W 402 and placed the state in line with the interpretation of the common law as held in a majority of the states JoNEs TFLEGRAPH AND 7I3MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW TELEPItONES p 362 In the United States Supreme Court opinion above quotled it is said But the principal recognized is that in the absence of congressional legislation upon the subject a state may require a common carrier although in the execution of a contract for interstate carriage to use great care and diligence and to be liable for the whole loss resulting from negligence in the discharge of its duties and We can see no difference in the application of the principlewhether enacted into a statute or resulting from the rules of law enforced in the state courts The same question came squarely before the court in Hart v C  N W Ry Co 69 Iowa 485 and it was there held that a statute similar to the Michigan statute was within the police power of the state that it fixed no rate imposed no burdens prescribed no rules and was therefore not a regulation of commerce beyond the power of the state to make In view of the inaction of Congress the decisions of the United States Supreme Court and the unchallenged determi nations of numerous state courts for many years the great weight of authority would appear to support the validity of a state statute such as the one sustained by the Michigan court JUDGMENTCOLLATERAL ATTACKPRESUMPTIONSPlaintiff brought an action to quiet title to certain lands basing his title upon a deed from one M to himself Respondent answered denying the ownership of said lands in the plaintiff and averring that he obtained title under sale by execution issued on a judgment against M Respondent set up the said judgment and plaintiff sought to show that it was void by failure to get service on M by publication as required by law Held that the present suit is a collateral attack on a judgment and that in such case the want of jurisdiction to render the judgment must appear upon the face of the judgment roll otherwise the judgment is conclusively presumed to be valid ONeill v Potvin I907  Idaho  93 Pac Rep 20 In the principal case it appeared upon the face of the judgment that the court had jurisdiction but the plaintiff attempted by extraneous evidence to contradict the record It is to be observed that this is an attack upon a domestic judgment consequently the reasoning of Pennoyer v Neff 95 U S 714 24 L Ed 565 does not apply Throughout the United States except in New York it appears to be the rule that in a collateral attack upon a domestic judgment only such facts and circumstances can be shown or relied on in support of such attack as appear affirmatively upon the face of the record or what under the law constitutes the judgment roll This question is carefully considered in the leading case of Hahn v Kelly 34 Cal 39I 94 Am Dec 742 Exhaustive note by A C Freeman where it is said that the record of a court of superior jurisdiction imports absolute verity and cannot therefore be collaterally impeached from without This case has been cited with approval by numerous courts and the principle it enunciates may be taken as firmly established Drake v Duvenick 45 Cal 454 As to the modification of the rule in the case of foreign judgments see

wife could testify one against the other in a criminal prosecution for a crime committed one against the other Held the wife is a competent witness against the husband in a criminal prosecution of the latter for failure to support the children Hunter v State Okl 134 Pac 1134 As a general rule at common law a husband or wife is not a compe tent witness against the other party to the marriage 1628 SIR EDWARD COKE COMMENTARY UPON LITTLETON 6b 4 WIGMORE Ev 3036 This rule however was subject to qualification Owing to the privacy of the mari tal relation it is peculiarily open to the commission of certain classes of crimes to which the injured party is the sole witness To hold witness incompetent would be to place the weaker party at the mercy of a tyran nical consort An exception to the main rule was therefore recognized and one party to a marriage could testify against the other where the crime was directly against the person of such party Sonles Case 5 Greenl Me 407 This exception was placed on the ground of neces sity not the ordinary ground of general necessity in evidence the object of which was merely to secure a witness but a special necessity the necessity of affording protection to the person of one from the actual physical violence of the other Bentley v Cooke 3 Doug 422 But the scope of this exception did not extend beyond those classes of crimes giving rise to the exception those involving actual bodily violence by one consort against the other It was accordingly limited to such crimes as assault and battery and other crimes of corporal violence Rex v Azir 1 Stra 633 Modern statutes preserving the general rule usually state the excep tion crimes against the other In construing these statutes many courts have greatly enlarged the scope of the exception as recognized at common law Under a statute worded crime against the other big amy has been included State v Sloan 55 Ia 217 7 N W 516 But see Basset v United States 137 U S 496 Adultery is included un der a similar statute State v Bennaett 31 Ia 24 But see State v Arm strong 4 Minn 251 Likewise incest State v Chambers 87 Ia 1 53 N W 1090 43 Am St Rep 349 But see State v Burt 17 S D 7 94 N W 409 67 L R A 172 106 Am St Rep 759 Crimes against the property of either party are usually held not to come within the meaning of such statutes thus in the case of arson State v Kephart 56 Wash 561 106 Pac 165 It is difficult to reconcile these decisions with accepted legal princi ples Failure to support the children of the marriage bigamy adultery and incest are more directly crimes against the marital relation than against either party to it Such holdings can only be justified by a very loose construction of the words crime against the other and these statutes being penal in their nature should receive a strict construction Again these statutes are declaratory of the common law and should he governed in their interpretation by the doctrine as accepted at common law 335VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW The general rule has been subjected to much adverse criticism 4 WIGMORE Ev 3037 et seq The motive actuating the courts in making such liberal constructions of these statutes has been the amelioration of this general rule But it is suggested that this is a matter for legislative remedy not of judicial intermeddling involving violations of accepted legal principles of statutory construction WITNESSES EFFECT OF FALSE TESTIMONY PRESUMPTIONS  Defendant had dynamite caps in his possession upon his farm He sold farm to plain tiff Later plaintiffs minor son was injured by the explosion of a dyna mite cap which it is claimed was picked up by a child in the barnyard While defendant testified that he had disposed of the caps before the occurrence of the injury witnesses testified that he had previously denied ever having had any caps on the premises Held it is a question for the jury and if they believe the defendant gave a false account of the dis position of the caps they are at liberty to infer that the truth would be unfavorable to him Eckart v Kiel Minn 143 N W 122 Statutes allowing parties to a civil suit to testify place such persons on the same ground as to competency as other witnesses their interest affecting their credibility only Cowles v Bacon 21 Conn 451 56 Am Dec 371 Cutler v Succession of Collins 37 La Ann 95 The mere fact that a party to a suit does not offer himself as a wit ness is not ground for an inference that his testimony would be unfavor able to his side of the controversy City of New Orleans v Gaunthreaux 32 La Ann 1126 But the nonappearance of a party litigant or his fail ure to testify as to facts material to his case and peculiarly within his own knowledge or his refusal to produce evidence in his possession creates a presumption that the truth if made to appear would be un favorable to his contention Cole v Lake Shore etc R Co 95 Mich 77 54 N W 638 Central Stock etc Exch v Chicago Bd of Trade 196 11l 396 63 N E

testimony of a witness when he willfully testifies falsely to a ma terial fact though it is not obliged to do so Mann v Arkansas etc Co 24 Fed 261 Rider v People 110 Ill 11 Reynolds v Greenbaum n 80 Ill 416 And attempts to bribe or intimidate a witness or to conceal evidence or intentional failure to produce the witness who was in the best posi tion to relate the true circumstances of the case or intentional falsehoods as to a material fact by the defendant are facts from which the jury are at liberty to presume that the truth if revealed would be unfavorable to the cause of the defendant

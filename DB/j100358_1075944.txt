j100358,The School Review,1075944,Geography The Function of MapDrawing,i244561,DEPARTMENTAL CONFERENCES GEOGRAPHY Mr J Paul Goode of the University of Chicago discussed THE FUNCTION OF MAPDRAWING IN THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY We draw maps because i geography deals primarily with spacerelation and all record comes sooner or later to a distribu tion in a map 2 the place for the atlas is in the head i e we need definite mental pictures of the map at least of the fundamentals of spacerelation 3 the study of the essentials and the exercise of the muscles in reproducing the form train the attention and fix a clear mental image The style of mapdrawing varies with the purpose for which the map is wanted and ranges from the rapidly drawn sketch map to the refined mathematical construction where accuracy of detail is allimportant In the rapid freehand drawing the prime requisites are first accuracy in fundamentals that is in the gross generalization of the details of outline and trend or in other words the reduction of the map to its lowest terms and second speed in drawing A map so drawn is the shorthand of geography These prin ciples applied to the continents give outlines so simple as to be as easily made as any six letters in the Roman alphabet These simple forms and the spacerelations represented in them are as fundamental as the paradigm in a language and should be drilled on in the same way The second style of drawing is the careful studied black board work in which days are spent on a single map The value of such work is openly questioned The time might be better spent in the library or in the field The third method of mapdrawing puts the emphasis on the 67TTHE CHOOL REVIEW representation of the third dimension The simplest phase is where a single contour is drawn for example the thousand foot level the lands below and above it being tinted in This is very simple can be done with extreme rapidity and has the highest value for the representation of the largest areas A more difficult phase of representation is by hachures or shading the socalled relief modeling lying on the borderland between a map and a picture This is qualitative and is of high value in physiography and in the study of the fine detail of relief but its value decreases very rapidly with the increase in the area represented and in continents it may easily teach larger untruth than truth It is inferior in the representation of exact altitude and slope values and may cost so much time and effort as to be a questionable luxury A fourth style is the careful accurate mechanical drafting This is quantitative and of the highest value in cultivating the hand and the head Crosssections are drawn to scale stereo grams to show structure various diagrams to illustrate the work in hand or distributions shown in carefully made maps Such drawing calls for unlimited skill and taste and is the best of training in the appreciation of the fine and artistic in maps The subject was further discussed by Mr Frank W Darling of the Chicago Normal School The subjectmatter of geography arranges itself into a natural causal order The most causal and most basal is the physical factor upon which closely depend the climatic conditions these largely determine the productive resources and upon these three depend the industrial forces The social and political organization and location of centers respectively are the effects of the preceding factors Throughout this enumeration no one factor is as influential a determining cause of each of the others as is the physical factor It follows that in order properly to teach the geography of any region the student must be thoroughly acquainted with the topography of that region Though political or outline maps may represent to a skilled student something of the topography of the interior yet they are as far from con veying any such idea to the child as would be a description of the region in shorthand For years we have attempted to teach geography by using the most indefinite symbols of the region the political mapa mere outline with highly colored arbitrary divisions a symbol reduced to a hieroglyph How 68DEPARTMENTAL CONFERENCES GEOGRAPHY much of a causal basis can the child obtain from this Everything which he learns of that region must stand in his memory alone without a foundation of reason One of the educational crimes which have gone hand in hand with the old formal teaching was the failure to give a definite image for a base upon which the child could build One of the indications of the con tempt in which representation of topography has been held is the absence of any good maps of American publication At present the complaint of teachers who see the need of giving the child a definite conception of the topography is that they can get no relief representations Yet a well prepared teacher has all that is really necessary By a sand model the child may be given not an accurate detailed expression of the region but a true caricature and as such representing the character of the region By chalk modeling a more detailed topographic map may be made The children can easily master this form of expression if they begin it with their first geography study The drawing of the political map should come as the last represen tation of the region and should be interpreted by the topographic representa tion This same principle is just as true when applied to the representation of land forms in the study of physical geography in the high school or college We are so often blinded by our own clear conception of a land form that we fail to give the child any definite representation which should come byactual observation of the thing itself or its representation in miniature showing the third dimension or at least a definite projection of its third dimension by chalkmodeling or some equally graphic representation Finally in order that the student may obtain a definite working concep tion he must reproduce it by some definite form of expression 69

Formations of Vtrgi nia By William B Rogers Professor of Natural Philosophy in the University of Virginia and Henry D Rogers Professor of Geology in the University of Pennsylvania Read May 5th 1835 I GEOLOGY OF A PORTION OF THE PENINSULA BETWEEN THE JAMES AND YORK RIVERS 1 The region of which we are about to treat comprises the coun ties of Elizabeth City Warwick York and James City and the lower extremities of New Kent and Charles City counties Its length in a north west direction is about fifty and its mean breadth about fourteen miles In Elizabeth City and Warwick counties and the eastern portion of York county the general level of the surface is but little elevated above tide The country is a uniform flat in some places subject to be occasionally overflowed The rest of the region in ques tion has an elevation above tide varying from twenty to eighty feet But few points however in the district have a level corresponding to either of these extremes and by far the larger portion of the surface preserves a height of from forty to fifty feet 2 The surface of this more elevated portion though preserving a general level of remarkable uniformity is deeply channelled by in numerable ravines The smaller of these connect themselves with large ones and these with the wider and deeper excavations formingS20 CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE GEOLOGY OF the beds of the creeks flowing into the James and York rivers The system of ravines connected with one river are separated by a narrow central tract from those connected with the other and in a genieral view of the district the two systems present the appearance of mere creeks oIr inlets subordinate to the two great rivers bounding the peninsula 3 The superficial stratum of the region we are describing is an argillaceous and ferruginous sand of a yellow and sometimes of a red dish colour in which are occasionally found at or near the surface pebbles and small boulders of sandstone rarely as much as six inches in diamneter The nature of these boulders would indicate that they were most probably derived from the sandstone formation which ranges along the eastern boundary of the primary ridge In some places this stratum consists of little else than a white silicious sand in others the admixture of ochreous clay is so considerable as to fuir nish a suitable material for the manufacture of bricks 4 Beneath this superficial layer beds of a very argillaceous clay occasionally occur sometimes of considerable depth and extent and of a texture to be useful in puddlinig Its colour is various being in some places a dark blue or green in others a bright red or dingy yellow Wherever found its upper boundary is remarkably even and horizon tal  but where it rests upon beds of fossil shells its lower limit con forms to all the irregularities of surface which those beds usually present Its appearance in somne places is that of a steep almost per pendicular wall of smooth surface and divided by very narrow lines running horizontally These narrow lines at a distance of from five inches to a foot asunder are formed by a more ferruginous and silicious clay At Bellefield on the York river seven miles from Williams burg this deposit may be seen overlying the stratum containing shells in some places having a thickness of from twelve to fifteen feet and then gradually fining out and passing into a light coloured and coarser mass The upper surface is horizontal and the lines of division above alluded to are perfectly parallel and regular The lower surface of the clay conforms to that of the shell stratum upon which it rests In many places these argillaceous beds consist of a yellowish clay beau tifully variegated by streaks of red and blueTHE TERTIARY FORMATIONS OF VIRGINIA 321 5 A thin stratum of red ferruginous stone containing a large pro portion of oxide of iron is found in this region running horizontally below the beds of clay before described and generallv separated by only a few feet from the underlying masses of shells This stratum which is very generally present varies in thickness from an inch to a foot Its texture is sometimes cellular sometimes compact and fibrous like that of certain varieties of hematite 6 The matter which in most cases rests immediately upon the shells is a yellowish brown sand frequently containing a large pro portion of clay Throughout this mass and often extending to the distance of five or six feet from the shells particles of green sand or the silicate of iron and potash are more or less abundantly dissemi nated and in the immediate vicinity of the shells these particles are generally condensed into narrow stripes conforming in flexure to the irregularities of the bed beneath Even where a deep hole exists in the layer of shells the stripes of green sand are seen still following the depression and rise of the surface and preserving a uniform distance from it Sometimes these thin layers are so mTuch indurated as to have almost the appearance of stone In none of the strata above de scribed have fossils of any description ever been discovered 7 The materials with which the shells are intermixed or in which they are embedded have various characters In some cases they consist principally of a nearly white sand in others the argillaccous matter greatly predominates and the mass is a somewhat tenacious clay Frequently much oxide of iron is mingled with the earthy matter giving it more or less of a yellow or brown appearance and this is the aspect which the upper beds containing shells most usually present Very generally the lowest visible fossiliferous stratum is composed of a green silicious sand and a bluish clay which being always very moist is soft and tenacious and presents a dark blue or black colour At the base of the cliffs on the James and York rivers this stratum may be traced continuously for considerable distances rarely rising more than two or three feet above the level of the water and presenting ani even horizontal outline In the deep ravines and low down in the banks of shells generally throughout this region a VOL v4 F322 CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE GEOLOGY OF similar dark bluishgreen argillaceous sand is observed enclosing fie quently a great ntumber and variety of slhells The very general existence of the lower stratum hiere described forms an interesting and prominent feature in the geology of the Mio cene Tertiary districts as well of eastern Virginia as of Maryland Throughout all the upper fossiliferous strata as well as in the argilla ceous beds just mentioned will be found disseminated greenishblack grains of silicate of iron and potash identical with those already de scribed as existinig in the stratum immediately overlying the shells anid having the same form and composition with the granules contained very abundantly in an older Fornmation both in this country and Eu rope In some beds of the marl or shells these particles so abound as to give a very decided colour to the whole mass In specimens from James City and York counties as much as thirtyfive per cent of the green sand has been found and occasionally shells are seen filled with this substance almost alone 7 The surface of the strata containing shells is usually irregular Sometimes it rises abruptly in the form of a hillock then it is scooped out into depressions of a few feet in depth These irregularities how ever are apparently of two kinds the one the original form of the deposit the other produced by denuding action upon the surface Thus in many places the same stratum miay be remarked rising with more or less abruptness then again descendinlg and perhaps preserving a nearly horizontal line for some distance marked at its upper surface by a clear and unbroken outline and presenting no indication of violent abrasion froin above In other places and this is a very frequent oc currence deep and irregular furrows and cavities are seen such as would naturally arise from the action of the currents and eddies of a large mass of water in rapid movement 8 Having thus given an account of the nature and arrangement of the strata overlying the shells as well as those in which they are im bedded we will now describe the general condition and disposition in which the shells occur 9 Condition of the shells in the tertiary deposits In general the state of the shells and their arrangement in the earth are such as to indicate their tranquil deposition at the spots in whichTHE TERTIARY FORMATIONS OF VIRGINIA 323 they are found Thus the corresponding valves are very often found together and closely shut Many of the smaller shells such as Arca centenaria Arca incile Nuculae Venericardia alticosta and Chama congregata which are most usually thus found are often either en tirely empty or contain a small quantity of clay that is quite irnpal pable indicating plainly that they have been exposed to no violence and that only such solid matter as could pass between the edges of the closed valves had obtained access to the interior Whenever such shells however have been previously drilled as is veiy frequently the case even with the largest and thickest slhells the interior is found entirely filled with sand clay green sand and sinall fragtments of shell In most cases the larger species of shells even when their valves appear to be in accurate juxtaposition is thus filled and in this case it cannot be supposed that the contained matter has entered through the holes thus drilled since in many instances shells of considerable magnitude are found imprisoned within Such shells no doubt after the death of the animnal remained open or at least partially so and received the sand clay and other materials which they contain by the gentle action of the waves The ligament at the hinge in the mean time would decay until at length yielding to the pressure of the accumulating matter above the shell in favourable circumstances would collapse into its natural closed condition The very common occurrence of the valves in juxtaposition is a strikinig proof that during or subsequent to their deposition they have not been exposed to violent agencies This becomes even more remarkable in the case of such shells as the Panopea reflexa which almost in every instance is found with the valves properly united The connection between the two valves in this shell is the slightest imaginlable after the destruction of the natural organic bond and an inconsiderable force would have sufficed to separate and break the valves 10 The admirable preservation of the shells in many cases is also ani interesting fact and affords another evidence of the absence of all violent agencies at this period The most fragile species of Natica delicate Tellinae Mactra tellinoides the shell and processes of the Crepidula the minute and sharp angles of the Fusus tetricus the thin324 CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE GEOLOGY OF and hollow Fissurella are found in perfect preservation in many places The state of the shells seems to depend chiefly upon the mechanical texture and chemical character of the materials with which they are miixed and of which the overlying stratum is composed In the moist bluie clay the shells are generally found in a very soft condition In a highly ferruginouis clayey bed they are found either partially or en tirely dissolved and beautiful casts remain in their stead 11 In inany places entire banks occur composed of casts of Chama and other shells sometimes separate sometimes cemented together so as to form a species of rock These appearances occur chiefly near the surface and when the soil is porous and ferruginous The casts thus formed often consist chiefly of carbonate of lime and in many specimens as mutich as eighty per cent of this substance is found Casts of this kind belong mostly to the smaller shells and by far the most common are of thie Chama congregata These as already stated are often found nearly or quite empty and we may therefore con ceive that as the matter of the shell in an extensive bank of Chamas is gradually dissolved the water charged with carbonate of lime enters the cavities and slowly deposits the carbonate mixed with fine parti cles of clay and sand Thus by degrees the cavities are filled In the mean time the shell disappears frequently leaving on the surface of the cast a chalky covering like the decomposed inner film of shelly matter In support of this explanation it may be added that in many casts beautiful crystals of carbonate of lime are found forming a por tion of the cast and having the appearance of Dogtooth Spar In some cases the shelly matter appears to have been dissolved and its place supplied by the crystallized carbonate encrusting the earth for merly contained within the shell Sometimes too a thin film of oxide of iron surrounds the cast showing very distinctly all the mark ings of the inner surface of the shell In maniy localities presenting a series of beds differing in composition the shells will be found perfect in some of them while in others imimediately above or below only casts remain Thus at the College Mill about one mile from Wil liamsburg the upper fossiliferous layer is a yellow silicious sand con taining perfect shells Below this is a brown ferruginous clay filled with the most beautiful casts of Chama Pectunculus Turritella cTILE TERTIA1tY FORMATIONS OF VIRGINIA 325 The shelly matter has entirely disappeared and the casts lie loosely in the cavities produced by the removal of the shells entirely distinct from each other and covered by a film of oxide of iron The layer beneath consisting of bluishgreen silicious clay is full of well pre served Pectens Pernas and a variety of other shells 12 In general the various species of shells are found associated in coloniies or groups but as in the case of banks of recent shells these coloinies contain many scattered specimens differing from the general contents of the group The two species of Chanma the C congregata and C corticosa which are found in almost every deposit of shells in this region in many cases form exteinsive beds with a very small ad mixture of other genera The best agricultural nmarl of a purely cal careous nature which is used in lower Virginia is derived from these beds of Clhama the friable texture of the shell ulpon exposure to the air rendering this species of marl more easy of application to land and miore promipt in its ameliorating effects Crassatella often form an extensive deposit and tlle large Pectens occur in continuouis layers of considerable depth and extent The different species of Arca Arte mis Crepidulla c present a similar arrangement Even those shells which are of comparatively rare occurrence are usually found in little groups Thllus the Isocardia fraterna is founid to the extent of a dozen or twenty closely packed together This gregarious assemblage of shells of the same species is what would naturally be anticipated in the absence of violent agencies during or after theit deposition and furinislhes another very striking proof of the comparatively tranquil condition of the sea or estuary in which they were allowed to accu mulate 13 Disposition of the fossils In nearly all the vertical sections of the deposit we are now describ ing a series of lbeds or strata may be observed each distinguished by the predomninance of one or more species and the order of superposi tion of these beds frequently continues without initerruption for some distance It does not appear however that in localities remote from each other the arrangement of the shells is always alike although in many instances there appears to be a striking correspondence In a majority of cases in the neighbourhood of Williamsburg the upper layer VOL V4 G326 CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE GEOLOGY OF is composed principally of Chama congregata In many localities also the large Pectens mingled with Ostrea Virginica occupy the highest place But generally the same shell reappears as a predominant constituent of one or more of the subjacent beds and such is the diversity of ar rangement even in places but a few miles distant that it is obvious that no general order of succession exists Thus in a range of three miles we find Perna maxillata in some localities in the lowest stratum of dark blue argillaceous sand in others forming an upper or even the highest layer of the series At Wallers Mill three miles from Wil liamnsburg this fossil overlies the other shells whereas at the College Mill as already stated it forms a part of the lowest visible stratum So far therefore as relates to the tertiary beds of the district of which we are now treating and indeed of Virginia generally there is no such constancy in the position of this fossil in the series as to warrant the theoretical inference of its beloniging to a different tertiary period de duced by Mr Conrad from its relation to the other tertiary fossils in certain districts in Maryland 14 With the view of conveying more precise ideas of the disposi tion of the fossils in this region as well as describing some interesting facts peculiar to certain districts which have been investigated we an nex the following details in relation to some of the more important localities 15 Kings Mill one of the most interesting fossil localities in the neighbourhood of Williamsburg is situated on the north bank of the James river about twentyfive miles from its nouth The cliff in which the shells appear is abrupt and has a height varying from twenty to fortyfive feet above the water The strata of shells extend along the river wvith slight interruptions when the cliff sinks nearly to the level of the water for a distance of between two and three miles and they are found in a somewhat similar order of superposition for some dis tance inland Their general direction is horizointal but the outline of anly one stratum is frequently very irregular the suirface rising and falling with a steep inclination This irregular outline is particularly remnarkable with the beds of Chama whiclh are very thick at sonme points and then fine out rapidly and again expand 16 This deposit of shells is covered to the depth of from fouir toTHE TERTIARY FORMATIONS OF VIRGINIA 327 six feet by a brownish yellow sand intermixed with stripes of clay Beneath this is a thin layer of about one foot of very argillaceous and ferruginous clay of a red colour This rests upon a few inches thickness of gravel consisting of waterworn quartz rarely larger than a pea Beneath this is a layer from one to two feet thick consisting of yellow sand containing a great deal of the green or chloritic sand arranged in narrow stripes Next follows a layer of the same sand con taining principally Chama and Venus deformis This is from two to three feet in thickness Immediately below is a stratum cotnsisting almost ex clusively of Chama with a few Arca centenaria c This stratum vary ing from three to four feet in thickness is a mass of compacted shells with but little earthy matter intervening The earthy matter contains a very large proportion of the chloritic sand The next stratum is composed chiefly of laige Pectens and has a thickness of from one to two feet Below this is another dense stratum of Chama together with Area cen tenaria Panopea reflexa c and also very rich in the green sand Thick ness from four to six feet Then follows a second layer containing Pectens with Ostrea coinpressirostra one foot in thickness A third stratum in which Chama predominates follows next in thickness from two to three feet md at the base of the cliff is a layer containing Pee tens Ostrea compressirostra c four to five feet in thickness 17 Thus through a height of more than twenity feet in some places the cliff consists principally of shells of which there are a great many species besides those mentioned as predomlinating in the several beds On the extensive contiguous estates of Kings Mill and Little town these shells are largely used as a manure and for this pur pose the first and second beds of Chama are preferred on account of the immense amount of calcareous matter and the large proportion of green sand which they contain Judging fromn the occasional appear ance of bluish greenclay on the line of the beach and in some places immediately at the base of the cliff just described it is highly probable that a continuous strattum of this substance lies beneath the other beds throughlout the whole extent observed A horizontal bed of yellow ish clay extends for some distance along a lower portion of the cliff in which there are no fossils running within a few feet of its upper edge and beneath this bed and parallel to it is a thin layer of the iron ore328 CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE GEOLOGY OF formerly described At the foot of this cliff appears the underlying stratum of clay 18 Description of the cliffs at Yorktown on the York river The elevation abrupt form and peculiar structure of the cliffs at this point and for some distance both above and below render it an interesting spot to the geologist A dry and ample beach uninter rupted by creeks or inlets for several miles affords a ready access to the banks while the rivers edge strewed with fossils which have fallen from the cliff exposes a considerable variety of interesting spe cimens Immediately at York the river is only threeeighths of a mile in width but both above and below it expands to a breadth six or seven times as great At Wormleys creek about two miles below the town the cliff about to be described begins but from this point down to the extre mity of the peninsula the banks are unifornmly flat and low The cliff here consists at bottom of a bluish sandy clay containing immense numbers of Turritella alticosta Cytherea Sayana and many small uni valves over which lies a layer of brownish yellow sand with very few shells and those chiefly Nucula limatula and a few other species To this succeeds a stratum composed almost entirely of Crepidula costata so closely packed together as to leave little space for sand or other earthy matter The whole is covered to a variable depth by a stratum of coarse sand of various strong tints and evidently highly ferruginous The ele vation of the cliff increases and the nature of its contents gradually changes in approaching York The lower stratuimn disappears entirely after continuing for something less than half a mile previous to which however its fossil contents are changed the layer of the Turritellk being replaced by Crepidula closely packed together Cre pidula still ruiis on horizontally above and the intermediate stratum is now densely filled with Pectens Venus deformis Ostrea and a great variety of small shells frequently connected together so as to form hard nmasses of considerable size Still higher up the river the deposit assumes the character of successive lavers composed of comminuted shells connected together so as to form a porouis rock These frag ments are generally s small and so much rubbed and waterworn as to render it impossible to ascertain the species of shell of which theyTHE TERTIARY FORMATIONS OF VIRGINIA 329 once were portions Many small shells and occasionally large ones particularly Pectens are found mingled with the other constituents of the rocks and in some places thin layers of shells such as Venus and Crepiduila intervene between the adjacent strata The lheight of this fragmentary rock amounts in some places to forty feet In most places it has a highly ferruginous aspect though this is not invariably the case Frequently shells of considerable size sucli as Luicina anodonta are seen coated with or entirely changed into crystallinie carbonate of lime firmly cemented in the mass The texture of the rock is vari ous at soine points admittinig of b ing readily excavated by the pick and spade so as to form caves which have been occasionally used by the inhabitants in other places exhibiting a hard and semicrystalline structure and having the compactness of some forms of secondary limestonie The lower portion of the cliff having less cohesion than the est has been scooped oult by the action of water so as to give it occasionally an impending attitude Above the town the stratum of fragmenitary rocli becomes mnuch thinner being now reduced to about ten or twelve feet A stratum of yellowvish argillaceous clay abounding in Arteinis acetabulumn MNactras and other large shells lies immediately beneath the rock and lower still appears the stratum of bluish clay filled with Nucula li matula several species of Fusuis and various other fossils A narrow layer of iron ore extends along the cliff with occasional interrujptions at a small distance above the fossiliferous strata 19 This fragmentary rock continuies in a iiarrow band with some interruptions for about a mile and a half above York Beyond this point it is met with chiefly in detached mnasses Extensive beds of sthells similar to those which appear at York come to view in the vicinity of Bellefield and line the shore for a distance of about three miles These beds rest on the uisual stratum of sandy clay and are in sorne places as already described covered by a stratum of the samne substance At a still remoter point about six miiles above York on Joness plantation a porous rocky mass occurs overlying the stratum of slhells in a thin and interrupted layer Though very similar in ap pearance to the fragmentary mass before described and evidently at one time composed of portions of shells it is almost devoid of any trace VOL T4 H330 CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE GEOLOGY OF of carbonate of lime It appears to consist of silex slightly tinged with oxide of iron approaching in its porous character and harsh gritty texture to the nature of the burrstone of France Associated with this is a more compact rock containing some carbonate of lime with much silex and exhibiting very perfect casts and impressions of Pectens Cardium c Over these strata is the usual layer of iroin stone and the general aspect of the upper beds is somewhat ferrugi nous 2O It is interesting to remark that with some interruptions a frag mentary deposit similar to that observed at York extends to the lower extremity of the peininsula At Pocosin a flat swampy country which is often inundated by the tides this deposit is uniformly met with by diggiing a few feet below the surface Pectunctilus Pecten Ostrea as well as numerous small shells occur mingled with it as at York the fragments however are niot cemented together but form a loose fria ble mass 21 A very interesting feature in the structure of the cliff at York remains to be described Though the general direction of the fossil beds is nearly horizontal several of the strata of rock are composed of tranlsverse layers parallel to each other generally dippinig towards the north and making an angle of fifteen or twenty degrees with the hori zon The course of these lamine somnetimes differs in adjoining strata and in some places the obliquity diminishes gradually until the lamine become horizontal thus presenting a remarkable resemblance to the appearances described by Lyell and others as existing in the Crag of England The phenomenon here described viewed in connexion with the fragmentary structure of the rock and the general distribution of broken shells over the lower extremity of the peninsula would seem to indicate the former agency in this district of coast currents and an ocean surf p22 At Burwells Mill and other localities in the immediate neigh bourhood of Williamsburg nearly the same fossils occur as at Kings Mill ana Yorktown Besides shells and Zoophytes in these and other places in the peninsula the bones of cetaceous animals and the teeth of sharks are of very frequent occurrence in the fossiliferous beds but no remains of fresh water or land animals have as yet been discoveredTHE TERTIARY FORMATIONS OF VIRGINIA 331 The total number of species of shells from these points which have yet been identified is about ninetysix to which we will now add the following new species recently discovered by ourselves To this list others believed to be new and at present under examination will here after be added 11 DESCRIPTION OF SOME NEW MIOCENE FOSSIL

deposits identical and con tinuous with them stretching extensively to the north and south into the adjoining states are referable to the Miocene period of the Ameri can Tertiary will be readily admitted on adverting to the well marked relations of their organic remains 31 A careful summary of the fossils derived from the several local ities hitherto examined within the peninsula establishes the total num ber of those at present known to be very nearly one hundred Of these not more than eighteen are ascertained to belong to species now living showing a remarkable though no doubt accidental coincidence with the average proportion of recent species found in deposits of the Miocene period in Europe Lest it may seem objectionable to institute the comparison between the recent and the extinct shells of several localities taken in the aggre gate the ratio has been examined as it exists in some of the localities separately Thus in the cliffs at Kings Mill on the James river the whole number of species whpse analogies are at present satisfactorily established is about seventyfour of which but fourteen are of the pre sent day or recent The percentage here disclosed is therefore about nineteen being nearly the same with that above and still almost identical with the proportions in several of the Miocene localities of Europe 32 Making every possible allowance for future discoveries bringing to light as recent some of the now supposed extinct species it is still difficuilt to imagine with such a ratio as we have at present that the proportions can ever so far change as to make the living species of the deposit to equal or exceed the number of the extinct a condition ne cessary of course to entitle it to the name of Older Pliocene which it has received 33 The circumstance that in Prince George county the Miocene is superimposed directly upon Eocene from which it seems not to be separated by any features which would mark a long interval attendedTHE TERTIARY FORMATIONS OF VIRGINIA 335 by abrupt or violent actions furnishes another though not a deci sive argument against its belonging to a period so late as the Older Pliocene It seems reasonable to infer that the two would hardly be seen resting together in exact conformability as they do had they been separated in time by the whole interval between the Eocene and the Older Pliocene during which the surface of the former would be in a condition to undergo changes and irregularities nowhere perceived where they are seen in contact IV OF THE ORIGIN OF THE DEPOSIT OVERLYING THE MIOCENE SHELL MARL 34 It is not easy in the present state of our information to approx imate to the precise era when this overlying deposit was produced though it appears to have had a date perhaps long anterior to the latest superficial diluvium with which it is often confounded We infer this from the very general absence of all those signs which mark a trans  In a recent publication Sillimans Journal vol 28 p 106 Mr Conrad has attributed to a portion of the formation here under discussion namely the localities of Yorktown and the James river near Smithfield a date still more recent than the period of the Older Pliocene He ranks those deposits together with another at Suffolk Virginia anld one on the St Marys river Maryland under a new division Medial Pliocene it is stated at the same time that the recent species at those places compose about thirty per cent A subdivision of the formation as it occurs in Maryland characterized by Perna maxillata and a less propor tion of recent species is referred to the Older Pliocene while the opinion is advanced that the Miocene is probably altogether wanting Now to those familiar with the principles of the new nomenclature of the Tertiary it is obvious that the beds so styled the Older as well as the Medial Pliocene are entitled in strictness to the appellation of Miocene only To confer on a formation the name Medial Pliocene its shells should contain about thirty per cent extinct and seventy per cent recent and not the converse We believe moreover that the percentage of recent species at Yorktowvn is even materially less than thirty In No 3 of his work on American tertiary shells issued a little earlier than the other arti cle Mr Conrad adopts a somewhat different classification calling the several localities in Virginia and Maryland Older Pliocene as before except that stratum low down in the Maryland formation which is distinguished by the Perna maxillata and this he denominates Miocene For reasons before stated namely the small percentage of recent species through ouit them all we believe the whole together to have been produced in the Miocene epoch and to belong to one formation and we have been led into this note in the sincere wish to settle the question of the age of this division of our Atlantic Tertiary formations lest the student of American geology be disheartened by the perplexity which grows out of a shifting and incon sistent nomenclature336 CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE GEOLOGY OF portation by violent causes from a distance its materials being finely comminuted clays and sands usually arranged in a manner denoting a somewhat quiet deposition On the other hand its containiing no fos sils its distinct separation from the fossiliferous marl stratum beneath it the surface of which is furrowed and deeply channelled as if an in terval of erosive action had preceded it are facts which may possibly displace it from the Miocene era altogether and which for the present at least throw entire uncertainty upon the inquiry as to the position which it should occupy in the Tertiary series 35 It is not unlikely all things considered that the origin of this deposit is to be traced in the rise fronm beneath the sea of some of the more western portions of the tide water plain in other words with the appearance above water of the Eocene tract in that quarter This is rendered probable from the circumstance that this superficial bed often abounds near the bottom with grains of the green sand minieral so abundant in the Eocene of Virginia It is corroborated likewise by the fact that the shelly Miocene stratum reposing upon the Eocene sometimes shows tokens of considerable violence over its surface the shells being throughout a depth of several feet near the top in a frag mentary state anid much disturbed as nmay be seen in Priince George county and omi the Chickahominy river If we conceive that tracts in the Eocene district or above it were upheaved to near the waters level or entirely out of it while the countrv to the east was still submerged we may not only explain the facts here mentioned but by adverting to the nature of the actions which would supervene we may account by the sudden draining off of the uplifted water for the eroded surface of the Miocene marl and the sudden and total extinction of animal life which took place To this would naturally succeed the introductioni of nearly the same kind of matter under more tranquil circumstances brought downi from the newly exposed tract by river action the probable source we may conjecture of some of the sands and clays of finer texture which occur so regularly and quietly stratified every where in the upper parts of the deposit Later than all these operations must have been the diluvial action more or less extensive which grooved the surface of this depositTHE TERTIARY FORMATIONS OF VIRGINIA 337 throughout the Tertiary region with its innutimerable ravines and shal low valleys of excavation Whether this last change was impressed upon the surface by the final emergence of the whole territory from the sea to its present level or by some more universal denudinig flood which has swept the continent generally we venture not to decide though the comparatively small amount of transported superficial peb bles and boulders and the absenice of any which canl be traced beyond the nearest rocks at the head of tide incline us to attribute the denud ation in questioni to the supposed local actioni rather than to the other V EOCENE FORMATION OF VIRGINIA 36 Though somie attenition has been devoted by Mr Conrad aind other American naturalists to the Tertiary fossils of several localities in Virginia as yet their researches have been limiited to such as apper taiii to the subordinate divisions of the Tertiary group arranged by Mr Lyell unider the head of Pliocene and Miocene and though the existence of an Eocene deposit might naturally have beeni inferred no locality of this character appears to have beetn knownii to theni The existence of an extensive Eocene formation in eastern Virginia is nlow for the first time anniounced as furnishing an interesting stelp i the piogress of the geological inquiries which are now oni foot by legisla tive authoritv ill that state 37 This formation appears to have a genieral meridionial direction traversing the state from the Potomac to the Roanoke It is inter sected anid exposed by the principal rivers first making its appearance at from twenty to thirty miles below the primilary ridge The mnost interestinig locality whichi lhas as yet beeni visited atnd that from which the fossils lhave been most abunidantly obtained is on the James river beginning a little above City Poinit and extending niearly in a conti nuouIs manner to Coggins Point a distance following the flexures of the shore of about eleven iniles At Coggins Point Torbav anid Evergreen the cliffs have a height varying from thirty to forty feet At the base a stratum of what appears at first to be a blackish clay extends nearly horizonitally throughout the whole distance rising a little as it ascenids the river Its height above the water at Coggins VOL v4 K338 CONTRIBUTIONS TO TIlE GEOLOGY OF Point is about three feet at Evergreen upwards of ten measured to the upper edge of the stratuin It continues downwards to a depth of six or eighlt feet and terminates in an argillaceous clay of a bluishgray co lour This dark stratuin consists largely of particles of green sand or silicate of iron and potash It conitains a great nunmber of Eocene fos sils amnong which are Cardita planicosta Fusus longoevis c c al ready known as existing either in the Eocene of Paris or Alabama or in both But besides these it also contaiins a variety of beautiful and new species some of which will be described in the present paper These shells are at some points almnost entirely dissolved and very perfect casts alone can be procured but at other points tlhough in a soft condition they canl by using great care be obtained in an entire state 38 Above this stratum is a layer of what Mr Edmund Ruffin the able editor of the Farmers Register of Virginia calls gypseous earth This stratum appears once to have abounded in fossils but at present only casts and those in a very soft condition can be found They are however identical with the fossils of the lower stratum The earth of this layer besides a considerable proportioin of green sand contains a large amount of suilphate of lime disseminated in nminute grains and grouped in large and massive crystals Immediately above occurs a thin stratum of white clay at the junction of which with the former layer the crystallized gypsum is fournd in great abundance and almost perfectly pure Above the clay is a stratum of shells in a very disin tegrated condition but consisting of Ostrea selleformis and other Eocene fossils anid immediately above is a stratuin of the shells of ou r middle Tertiary A few scattered pebbles of a brown hue hardly numerous enough to form a stratum separate these two very distinict formations In this uppermost layer are found the common Pecten and Pectunculus of our middle rLertiary The whole thickness of the Eocene deposit  Among the interesting fossils of the middle 1ertiary above is an enormous specimen of Astrea which is worthy of being described This mass was some years ago disengaged from the upper part of the cliff at Torbay and is now lying on the shore firmly fixed in the sand and clay Though it has been much reduced in size siniee its fall it is still of immense mag nitude Its form is of course very irregular but its largest diameter may be estimated at fourTHE TERTIARY FORMATIONS OF VIRGINIA 339 at this point appears to be about twenty feet At distant points where this deposit has been exaamined as for instance near the Piping Tree on Pamunkey and near Port Royal on the Rappahannock as well as upon the Potomac much the same arrangement and succession of strata have been remarked 39 The section at Coggins Point presenits the interesting feature of a juxtaposition in the sanme cliff of the Eocene and newer Tertiary formations and on this account must be regarded as an important locality The fact too that in this as well as other places where the Eocenie deposit has been discovered so very large a proportion of the chloritic sand is contained in the matter embedding the fossils is we presume an uinexpected and interesting circumstance Even the New Jersey secondary strata are seldom more abundanit in this peculiar mineral product than the formation referred to anad hence the farmiers of Vir ginia are beginning to apply this material to their fields VI NEW FOSSIL SHELLS OF THE EOCENE

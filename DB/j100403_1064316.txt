lines are an advantage to the community at large and to the nearby prop erty owners in particular but it is an unwarranted extension of the doctrine to establish them under the police power All such legislation while it may assist to materialize the dreams of those whose highest ambition is to make other people conform to their ideas of beauty and order is clearly in derogation of common right and personal liberty In the matter of justice neither the property owner nor the public will be harmed if the regulation be made under the power of eminent domain Yet if it is en forced under the police power the owner is compelled to con tribute as a private individual and not as a member of the public at large R B MARITIME LIENS UNDER THE PRESENT LAWThe Act of Congress of June 23 1910 1 has done much to wipe out some of the distinctions that existed in the law on maritime liens on vessels for supplies and repairs In fact as was said in a recent case The Lord Baltimore 269 Fed 824 The act of Congress was intended to furnish a complete system in itself It enun ciated a new policy in the admiralty law of this country clarify ing the law and purging it from the many distinctions that had no real basis in the law Early in the history of this country there grew up a distinc tion between supplies furnished a vessel while in her home port and those furnished in a foreign port In the latter case under proper conditions it gave rise to a lien on the vessel in the former no lien was presumed save in the case where the statute of that State made provisions for such lien2 This distinction first found utterance in The General Smith3 in which Mr Jus tice Story said Where repairs have been made or necessaries have been fur nished to a foreign ship or to a ship in a port of the State to which she does not belong the general maritime law fol lowing the civil law gives the party a lien on the ship itself for his security and he may well maintain a suit in rem in the Admiralty to enforce his right But in respect to re pairs and necessaries in the port or State to which the ship belongs the case is governed altogether by the municipal law of that State and no lien is implied unless it is recog nized by that law Though this departure from the general admiralty law as it 1 Comp St  77837787 2 The General Smith 4 Wheat 438 The Belfast 7 Wall 624 The Mary McCabe 22 Fed 750

moral approval of the courts It was much criticized Courts refused to extend it be yond repairs and supplies as laid down in The General Smith4 In Chapman v The Engines of The Greenpoint5 the court re fused to extend it to include salvage and permitted a lien though the salvage took place in the home port of the ship In this case the court observed That the rule as to repairs and supplies which early obtained a foothold in our maritime law was not suited to the general necessities of this country is sufficiently attested by the fact that in nearly all the states liens upon do mestic vessels have been provided for by statute to supply the exceptional defects of our maritime law Objection to the law as it existed prior to the Act of Congress is found in an elaborate and exhaustive opinion by Judge Lowell in The Underzriter6 in which the background of the distinction is traced in a most learned fashion and its unsoundness effectively demonstrated The judge summarizes the result of this investigation in the fol lowing words But though the historical basis for the distinc tion is demonstrably unsound the distinction has been established by competent authority and cannot be abolished except by legis lation 7 This legislation is now an established fact Whether the dis tinction was historically unsound and whether it was poor policy to have enunciated it from the beginning is of no moment now The entire distinction has now fallen into innocuous desuetude by virtue of the Act of Congress Under the old law even as to supplies furnished a vessel in a foreign port to fasten a lien on the vessel therefor a necessity had to be established This necessity consisted of two elements 1 a necessity for the material or repairs 2 a necessity for looking to the vessel for reimbursement8 Thus if the supplies were necessary and the owner absent from that port or had no credit there such supplies were presumed to have been furnished on the credit of the vessel But the presumption was rebuttable and the absence of either of these necessities destroyed the pre sumption9 As said by one court As the law stood before Congress spoke a materialman would under some circumstances have a lien if he could prove that he had given credit to the ship while he would not have it if it appeared that he had trusted the owner When it be came necessary to go into an inquiry as to whether he had

on the credit of the ship or of the owner the less scrupulous he was the better the chance of his getting his money Congress said that for the future it would not be necessary to allege or prove that credit was given to the vessel 10 The presumption now is that a lien exists on the vessel though the repairs were made or the supplies furnished at the behest of the owner1l Thus one furnishing fuel to a vessel under contract is entitled to a lien though the bill is made out to the owner and not to the vessel12 In fact it was held to be immate rial to the creation of a lien whether the supplies furnished were intended to be on the credit of the vessel in the absence of an agreement on the subject13 It is to be observed that in dispensing with the necessity of pleading and proving that credit was given the vessel Congress did not abolish the first of the above mentioned requisites namely the necessity for the material or repairs14 Maritime liens rest upon the necessity of the ship and are not created for the sole purpose of giving an added security to the materialman or other creditor As Mr Justice Brandeis put it in Piedmont etc Co v Seaboard Fisheries Co 15 The maritime lien developed as a necessary incident of the operation of vessels The ships function is to move from place to place She is peculiarly subject to vicissitudes which would compel abandonment of vessel or voyage un less repairs and supplies were promptly furnished This is the foundation for the lien The libellant is therefore put on guard to kndw that the supplies are necessary for the vessel furnished therewith Under the old law to charge a vessel for repairs or supplies it was necessary that the person ordering had the authority to contract for them16 The new law allows the claimant to rely upon the apparent authority of the person in lawful charge of the vessel But if the claimant knew that the party ordering had no authority or by diligent inquiry could have ascertained that fact or if the person is not lawfully in charge no lien will arise 0 The City of Milford 199 Fed 956 959 Ely v Murray and Tregurtha Co 200 Fed 368  Lower Coast Co v Gulf Refining Co 211 Fed 326 13 City of Milford

reasonable diligence could have ascertained was borrowed from The Kate17 removing the premium on negligence in inquiring into facts which would reveal the lack of authority of the person in charge Only reasonable diligence is required He who is careless of others rights will find that his own will be determined not by what he absolutely knew but what was in his power to find out if he acted with ordinary and reasonable care 18 The purpose of the act and what it has accomplished may well be summarized in the words of Mr Justice Brandeis 19 First to do away with the artificial distinction by which a maritime lien was given for supplies furnished to a vessel in a port of a foreign country or State but denied where the supplies were furnished in the home port or State    Second to do away with the doctrine that when the owner of a vessel contracts in person for necessaries or is present in the port when they are ordered it is presumed that the materialman did not intend to rely upon the credit of the vessel and that hence no lien arises    Third to substitute a single federal statute for the State statutes in so far as they confer liens for repairs supplies and other necessaries    The act relieves the libelant of the burden of proving that credit was given to the ship when necessaries are furnished to her upon the order of the owner but it in no way lessens the materialmans burden of proving that the supplies in question were furnished to her by him upon order of the owner or of some one acting by his au thority M A S 17 164 U S 458 466 The City of Milford

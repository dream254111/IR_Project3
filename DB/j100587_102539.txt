Aug 18 1698 T H E Question you lately proposed to me by a Friend of yours concerning Musick was not Whence it comes to pass that Musick hath so great an In fluence or Efficacy on our Affections Passions Motions c But whence it is that these great effects which are reported of Musick in Former Times of Orpheus Am phion c are not as well found to follow upon the Musick of Later Ages If that first had been the Question Whence it is that Musick Operates on our Fancies Affections Passions Motions c and not ours only but of other Animals for it is manifest that Birds and Beasts are affected with Musical Notes as well as Men And even as things inani mate for tis well known that of two UnisoneStrings though at some distance if one be struck the other will move I say if this were the Question I must in answer to it have discoursed of the Nature of Sounds produced by some Subtile Motions in the Air propagated and conti nued to the Ear and Organs of Hearing and thence com municated to the Animal Spirits which excite suitable Imaginations Affections Passions c and these at tended with conformable Motions and Actions and ac cording to the various Proportions Measures and Mix tures of such Sounds there do arise various Effects in the Mind or Imagination suitable thereunto Thus the rough Y y Musick298 Musick of Drums and Trumpets is apt to produce Cou rage and Fierceness in Martial Minds and more or less according to the Degrees of Roughness And sweeter Sounds of more sedate Musick are apt to excite softer Passions and of inferreddifferentinferred Kinds and Degrees according to the Slowness or Swiftness Loudness or Calmness Acuteness or Gravity and the various Measures and Mixtures of such Musical Sounds The Animal Spirits being apt to receive Impressions answerable to those sub  Motions communicated to them from the Organs of Hearing But the Question you move is only of the Comparative Effects of Musick reported to have been in the Days of old beyond what appears upon that of later Ages In answer to which there are many things to be con sidered 1 I take it for granted That much of those Reports is highly Hyperbolical and next door to Fabulous ac cording to the Humour of those Ages termed by Histo rians Tempus Mythicum the Fabulous Age for whate ver may be thought of Men Beasts and Birds no Man can think that the Trees and Stones did Dance after their inferredPipeinferred And even in more modest Times the Poetical Stories of Olympus Atlas and other Mountains reach ing up to Heaven are much beyond what is now to be found in those Parts where they are said to have been and many Mountains now well known as the Alps the Apennines the Pike of Teneriff are much higher than their Atlas orOlympus And their Famed Tyber is but a Ditch compared with our Thames And like Abate ments we must allow to the Hyperbolical Elogies of their Musick 2 We must consider That Musick to any tolerable Degree was then if not a New at least a Rare Thing which the Rusticks on whom it is reported to have had such299 such Effects had never heard before and on such a little Musick will do great Feats As we find at this Day a Fiddle or a Bagpipe among a Company of Country Fellows and Wenches who never knew better or at a Country MorriceDance will make them skip and shake their Heels notably And the like heretofore to a Sheperds Reed or OatenPipe And when some such thing happened amongst those Rusticks of Old That with somewhat of Hyperbole would make a great Noise 3 We are to consider that their Musick even after it came to some good Degree of Perfection was much more plain and simple than ours now adays They had not Consorts of Two Three Four or more Parts or Voices But one single Voice or single Instrument apart which to a rude Ear is much more taking than more compounded Musick And we find that a simple Jig sung or playd on a Fiddle or Bag Pipe doth more affect a company of Rusticks than a set of Vials and Voices For that is at a Pitch not above their Capacity where as this other confounds it with a great Noise but no thing distinguishable to their Capacity Like some deli cate Sauce made up of a Mixture of many Ingredients which may yield an agreeable Taste but not so as to di stinguish the particular Relish of any one But Honey or Sugar by it self they could understand and Relish with a more particular Gusto 4 We are to consider That Musick with the Ancients was of a larger extent than what we call Musick now adays For Poetry and Dancing or comely Motion were then accounted parts of Musick when Musick arri ved to some Perfection Now we know that Verse of it self if in good Measures and Affectionate Language and this set to a Musical Tune and sung by a decent Voice and accompanied but with soft Musick instrumental if Y y 2 any300 any such as not to drown or obscure the  Expressions like what we call RecitativeMusick will work strangely upon the Ear and move Affections suita ble to the Tune and Ditty whether Brisk and Pleasant or Soft and Pitiful or Fierce and Angry or Moderate and Sedate especially if attended with a Gesture and Action suitable For tis well known that suitable Act ing on a Stage gives great Life to the Words Now all this together which were all Ingredients in what they called Musick must needs operate inferredStronglyinferred on the Fan cies and Affections of ordinary People unacquainted with such kind of Treatments For if the deliberate reading of a Romance when well pennd will produce Mirth Tears Joy Grief Pitty Wrath or Indignation suitable to the respective Intents of it much more would it so do if accompanied with all those Attendants 5 You will ask perhaps Why may not all this be now done as well as that I answer no doubt it may and with like Effect if an Address be made in proper Words with moving Arguments in just Measures Poe tical or Rhetorical with the Emphatick Words Words set in signal Places pronounced with a good Voice and a true Accent and attended with a decent Gesture and all these suitably adjusted to the Passion Affection or temper of Mind particularly designed to be producd be it joy Love Grief Pitty Courage or Indignation will certainly now as well as then produce great Effects upon the Mind especially upon a Surprize and where Persons are not otherwise preengagd And if so ma naged as that you be or seem to be in earnest and if not overacted by apparent Affectation 6 We301 6  We are to consider that the usual Design of what we now call Musick is very different from that of the Ancients What we now call Musick is but what they called Harmonick which was but one Part of their Mu sick consisting of Words Verse Voice Tune Instru ment and Acting and we are not to expect the same Effect of one Piece as of the whole And of their Har monick at first when we are told by a great Hyperbole that it did draw after it not Men only but Birds Beasts Trees and Stones this is no more bating the Hyper bole but what we now see daily in a CountryTown when Boys and Girls and Countrysolk run after a Bagpipe or a Fidler especially if they had never seen the like before of which we are apt even now to say All the Town runs after the Fidler or the Fidler draws all the Town after him or as when they flock about a BalladSinger in a Fair or the MorriceDancers at a Whit sund Ale And all their Hyperboles can signifie no more but this when their Musick was but a Reed or an open Pipe 7 Its true that when Musick was arrived to greater Perfection it was then applied to particular Designs of exciting this or that particular Affection Passion or Temper of Mind as Courage to Soldiers in the Field Love in an Amorous Addrels Tears and Pitty in a Doleful Ditty Fury and Indignation in a Fiercer Tune and a Sedate Temper when applyed to compose or paci fy a Furious Quarrel the Tunes and Measures being suitably adapted to such Designs 8 But such Designs as those seem almost quite neg lected in our present Musick The chief Design now in our most accomplishd Musick being to please the Ear when by a sweet Mixture of different Parts and Voices with just Cadences and Concords intermixd a Grateful Sound302 Sound is produced to please the Ear as a Cooks well tempered Sauce doth the Palate which to a common Ear is only a confused Noise of they know not what though somewhat Pleasing while only the judicious Musician can discern and distinguish the just Pro portions 9 Tis true that even this Compound Musick admits of different Characters some is more Brisk and Airy others more Sedate and Grave others more Languid as the different Subjects do require But that which is most proper to excite particular Passions or Dispositions is such as is more simple and uncompounded such as a Nurses Languid Tune lulling her Babe to sleep or a continued reading in an even Tone or even the soft Murmur of a little Rivulet running upon Gravel or Pibbles inducing a quiet Repose of the Spirits And contrarywise the Briskness of a Jig on a Kit or Violine exciting to Dance Which are more Operative to such particular Ends than an elaborate Composition of Full Musick Which Two differ as much as that of a Cooks mixing a Sauce to make it Palatable and that of a Phy sician mixing a Potion for curing a particular Distemper or procuring a just Habit of Body where yet a little Su gar to sweeten it may not do amiss 10 To conclude then If we aim only at pleasing the Ear by a sweet Consort I doubt not but our modern Compositions may equal if not exceed those of the An cients Amongst whom I do not find any Footsteps of what we call several Parts or Voices as Bass Treble Mean c sung in Consort answering each other to compleat the Musick But if we would have our Mu sick so adjusted as to excite particular Passion Affections or Temper or Mind as that of the Ancients is supposed to have done we must then imitate the Physician rather than303 than the Cook and apply more simple Ingredientsfitted to the Temper we would produce For in the sweet Mixture of compounded Musick one thing doth so cor rect another that it doth not operate strongly any one way And this I doubt not but a judicious Composer may so effect that with the Help of such Hyperboles as with which the Ancient Musick is wont to be set off our Musick may be said to do as great Feats as any of theirs I am S I R Your very Humble Servant

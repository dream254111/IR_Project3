J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1015056,PROBLEMS OF THE COLORED CHILD,I242688,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY VELOPMENT OF A LIMITED PROGRAM OF CHILD PROTECTION IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN ACTIVE AND WELL EQUIPPED JUVENILE COURTS THE JUVENILE COURT OF CHI CAGO IS THE BEST ILLUSTRATION OF THIS TEND ENCY BUT THE JUVENILE COURT DOES NOT SEEM THE LOGICAL PLACE FOR LOCATING THIS RESPONSIBILITY THE TREND OF CHILD PROTECTION IS TOWARD AN EARLY RECOGNI TION OF MENACING CONDITIONS INSTEAD OF HAVING MOST OF ITS WORK ADJUSTED BY COURT ACTION A WELL EQUIPPED AGENCY REQUIRES COURT ACTION IN A DECREASING PROPORTION IT IS THEREFORE MORE SUIT ABLE TO HAVE SUCH SERVICE RENDERED BY A STATE AGENCY WITH COUNTY OR DISTRICT UNITS OF SERVICE JUST AS IN THE CARE OF DEPENDENT CHILDREN PRIVATE AGENCIES ARE RENDERING A VALUABLE SUPPLEMENTAL SERVICE WHER EVER A PUBLIC AGENCY HAS BECOME ACTIVE IN THEIR CARE AND PLACEMENT SO IN THE FIELD OF CHILD PROTECTION THE PRIVATE AGENCIES CAN BE EQUALLY VALUABLE SUCH PRIVATE SOCIETIES BECOME EXPERI MENTERS MOULDERS OF PUBLIC OPINION AND ANCHORS FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF GOOD PUBLIC IDEALS AND STANDARDS THE CHILD PROTECTION MOVEMENT OF THE HUMANE SOCIETIES HAS ON THE WHOLE REACHED SUCH A PRECARIOUS POSITION THAT IT IS NO LONGER PERFORMING ITS PUBLIC FUNCTION IN ANY ADEQUATE MANNER A FEW STRONG SOCIETIES CHIEFLY LOCATED IN LARGE CITIES HAVE MET THE NEED BUT LARGELY WITH A RESTRICTED PROGRAM IT IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE THAT A NEW PUBLIC SERVICE IN CHILD PROTECTION SHOULD BE CREATED OR WHERE IT HAS ALREADY BEGUN THAT IT SHOULD BE EXTENDED TO GIVE ALL UNFORTUNATE CHILDREN A SQUARE DEAL PROBLEMS OF THE COLORED CHILD BY EUGENE KINCKLE JONES EXECUTIVE SECRETARY NATIONAL URBAN LEAGUE IN PUBLIC RECOGNITION NEGROES REPRE SENT A CLASS AS WELL AS A RACE AND INHERIT THE STATUS FIXED FOR BOTH CLASS AND RACE DIVISIONS OF OUR POPULATION WITHOUT AFFIRMING ANY DIFFERENCES IN INSTINCT RACIAL TRAITS OR FAMILY STRUC TURE IT IS A FACT THAT THE PROBLEMS OF THE COLORED CHILD HAVE SPECIAL AND DIS TINCT FEATURES HIS PROBLEMS ARE NOT ONLY THE REGULAR AND EXPECTED PROB LEMS FAMILIAR TO SOCIAL WORKERS GIVEN GREATER VOLUME AND INTENSITY BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIC CLASS TO WHICH MOST COLORED CHILDREN BELONG BUT THEY ARE THESE PROBLEMS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE NEGROS SOCIAL STATUS WHICH LIMITS HIS PARTICIPATION IN THE NORMAL SCHEME OF ADJUSTMENT WITH MORE THAN 70 PER CENT OF THE NEGRO POPULATION OF TEN YEARS OF AGE AND OVER CLASSED AS WAGE EARNERS AND OVER 70 PER CENT OF THESE WAGE EARNERS CLASSED AS UNSKILLED NEGROES CONSTITUTE AN ECONOMIC CLASS UPON WHICH THE BUR DEN OF CHILD REARING FALLS HARDEST THE FACTOR OF RACE INTENSIFIES THESE DIFFICUL TIES BY THE ADDITION OF OTHERS THE PROBLEM OF ILLITERACY THE HEAVY ILLITERACY RATE AMONG NEGRO CHILDREN ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTH IS FREQUENTLY TAKEN AS AN EVIDENCE OF NATIVE BACKWARDNESS AND PARENTAL IN DIFFERENCE GRANTED THAT BOTH OF THESE ALLEGED CAUSES ARE FACTORS WORTHY OF CONSIDERATION THERE IS STILL A FRIGHTFUL INADEQUACY IN SCHOOL FACILITIES WHICH RENDERS THEM INSIGNIFICANT DETERRENTS BY COMPARISON IN 1910 THE PER CENT OF NEGRO ILLITERATES TEN YEARS OF AGE AND OVER WAS 304 THE PERCENTAGES VARIED WITH THE STATES FROM 79 PER CENT IN 142PROBLEMS OF THE COLORED CHILD NEW YORK TO 387 IN SOUTH CAROLINA IN THESE FIGURES IS REFLECTED NOT ONLY THE INFLUENCE OF THE COMPULSORY EDUCATION LAW BUT THE PROVISION OR RATHER LACK OF PROVISION FOR SCHOOL FACILITIES AS WELL FOR EXAMPLE WHEREAS NEW YORK HAS COMPULSORY EDUCATION AND PROVIDES THE SAME SCHOOLING FOR NEGROES AS FOR WHITES SOUTH CAROLINA MAINTAINS SEP ARATE SCHOOLS IN WHICH THE AVERAGE YEARLY EXPENDITURE FOR EACH WHITE CHILD IS 1114 AS AGAINST 125 FOR A COLORED CHILD NOT ONLY ARE COLORED CHILDREN NOT URGED TO ATTEND SCHOOL BUT THERE ARE NOT EVEN ENOUGH SCHOOL BUILDINGS TO ACCOMMODATE THE COLORED CHILDREN WHO APPLY FOR ADMISSION IN SOUTH CARO LINA FOR EXAMPLE 392 PER CENT ARE OUT OF SCHOOL IN FLORIDA 47 PER CENT AND IN LOUISIANA 564 PER CENT MONROE N WORK EDITOR OF THE NEGRO YEAR BOOK HAS ESTIMATED THAT ON THE BASIS OF A NINE MONTHS SCHOOL YEAR IT WOULD TAKE A NEGRO CHILD 22 YEARS IN LOUISIANA 26 YEARS IN ALABAMA AND 33 YEARS IN SOUTH CAROLINA TO COMPLETE AN ELEMENTARY COURSE THESE HANDICAPS ARE MAINTAINED IN MANY SECTIONS THROUGH THE STRENGTH OF A VERY COMMON BELIEF THAT EDUCATION UNFITS NEGROES FOR THE REAL LABOR FOR WHICH THEY ARE DESTINED THAT PLACING THEM IN SCHOOL WOULD INTERFERE BOTH WITH THE PLANTING AND THE HARVESTING OF CROPS AND THAT A MORE EQUITABLE DIS TRIBUTION OF FUNDS WOULD PROVE UNFAIR TO WHITE TAXPAYERS THESE OPINIONS PREVAIL IN SPITE OF THE VERY PERSISTENT WARNING OF STUDENTS OF THE PROBLEM THAT THE LACK OF THIS SCHOOLING AND DIS CIPLINE EVENTUALLY REGISTERS ITSELF IN DEPENDENCY DELINQUENCY AND CRIME WHICH IN TIME ENTAIL A GREATER FINANCIAL AND MORAL BURDEN ON THE STATE EDUCATIONAL PROBLEM IN THE NORTH IN THE NORTH THERE IS ALSO AN EDUCA TIONAL PROBLEM FOR COLORED CHILDREN THE NORTHWARD MOVEMENT OF NEGROES SINCE SLAVERY AND THE MIGRATION OFA HALFMILLION NEGROES FROM THE SOUTH FOLLOWING THE OUTBREAK OF THE WORLD WAR HAVE BROUGHT THOUSANDS OF CHIL DREN FROM THE WRETCHED SCHOOLS OF MANY SECTIONS OF THE SOUTH WHEN RE CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THE MORE REGU LAR AND RIGID REQUIREMENTS OF NORTHERN SCHOOLS THEY BECOME OVERAGE PUPILS LARGE AWKWARD CHILDREN RANGING IN AGES FROM THIRTEEN TO EIGHTEEN IN CLASSES WITH CHILDREN OF SEVEN AND TEN THE SEVERE EMBARRASSMENTS TO THEM INCREASE TRUANCY PROBLEMS DELINQUENCY AND REBELLION AGAINST HOME AND SCHOOL DISCIPLINE IN 1915 A STUDY OF FIVE HUN DRED NEGRO CHILDREN IN THE NEW YORK PUBLIC SCHOOLS WHICH ACCOMMODATED THE LARGEST NUMBER OF CHILDREN WHOSE PAR ENTS REPRESENTED THE NEWCOMERS RE VEALED THAT 605 PER CENT OF THE NORMAL CHILDREN WERE OVERAGE FOR THEIR GRADE SOME HAD ENTERED SCHOOL THERE FOR THE FIRST TIME AT THE AGES OF TWELVE AND FIFTEEN A SIMILAR STUDY IN 1920 BY THE CHI CAGO COMMISSION ON RACE RELATIONS DISCLOSED PRACTICALLY THE SAME CONDI TION IN CHICAGO IT WAS FURTHER DIS CLOSED HOWEVER THAT WHERE THE CHIL DREN REMAINED AND PROVISIONS WERE MADE FOR THE UNGRADED PUPILS THEY REACHED THEIR NORMAL GRADES IN TWO OR THREE YEARS INFANT MORTALITY ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS OF THE SPECIAL PROBLEMS IS THAT OF REDUCING THE HIGH INFANT MORTALITY AND THE PREVALENCE OF DISEASES AMONG COLORED CHILDREN FOR IN THIS IS REFLECTED THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THEY MUST LIVE THE STARTLING DISPROPORTION IN THE INFANT MORTALITY RATE BETWEEN WHITE AND NEGRO CHILDREN EMPHASIZES PUBLIC IGNORANCE AND NEGLI GENCE THE INFANT DEATH RATE AMONG NEGROES IS ENORMOUS IN SOME CITIES MOUNTING AS HIGH AS 200 INFANT DEATHS PER 1000 BIRTHS 143THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY ACCORDING TO FIGURES OF THE METRO POLITAN LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY WHICH NUMBERS AMONG ITS MEMBERS ONESIXTH OF THE ENTIRE NEGRO POPULA TION IN THE UNITED STATES THE NEGRO DEATH RATE AMONG ITS INDUSTRIAL POLICY HOLDERS IS 60 PER CENT GREATER THAN THAT OF THE WHITE TUBERCULOSIS PREIMI NENTLY A DISEASE OF YOUNG PEOPLE TAKES A HEAVY TOLL FOR COLORED BOYS INSURED BY THE COMPANY THIS RATE IS ELEVEN TIMES HIGHER AND FOR COLORED GIRLS EIGHT TIMES HIGHER THAN THE RATE FOR WHITE BOYS AND GIRLS RESPECTIVELY OF THE SAME AGE PERIOD MALARIA TYPHOID FEVER SYPHILIS AND HOOKWORM ALSO HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH SICKNESS AND DEATH RATE LOUIS I DUBLIN CHIEF STATISTICIAN OF THE METROPOLITAN LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY IN PRESENTING THESE FACTS BEFORE A CONFERENCE OF THE NATIONAL URBAN LEAGUE SAID WHETHER WE LOOK AT THE RECORDS OF THE DRAFT EXAMINATIONS OR THE FIGURES OF MORTALITY AMONG POLICY HOLDERS OF THE METROPOLITAN WE FIND THE SAME FACT IN EVIDENCE NAMELY VERY MUCH HIGHER RATES AMONG COLORED PERSONS FROM THOSE DISEASES AND CONDITIONS WHICH REFLECT THE SANITARY CONDITIONS OF THE ENVIRON MENT PRACTICALLY ALL OF THESE DIS EASES CARRYING SUCH A HEAVY DEATH TOLL CAN BE CHECKED THROUGH CLOSER ATTEN TION TO SANITATION WATER AND MILK SUP PLY FOOD HANDLING GARBAGE DISPOSAL GENERAL HOUSING CONDITIONS AND INSTRUC TION IN PERSONAL HYGIENE THE METRO POLITAN LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY THROUGH ENCOURAGING EFFORTS ALONG THIS LINE HAS HELPED TO REDUCE THE DEATH RATE AMONG ITS COLORED POLICY HOLDERS 9 PER CENT IN EIGHT YEARS IN NEW YORK CITY ALONE THE COLORED INFANT DEATH RATE IS 164 DEATHS PER 1000 BIRTHS AS AGAINST 82 PER 1000 BIRTHS FOR WHITES TWICE AS MANY NEGRO BABIES DIE EACH YEAR AS WHITE BABIES ALTHOUGH THE WHITE POPULA TION IS MORE THAN THIRTY TIMES THAT OF THE COLORED ONLY SEVEN TIMES AS MANY WHITE BOYS AND GIRLS AS COLORED BOYS AND GIRLS UNDER FOURTEEN YEARS OF AGE DIED IN NEW YORK DURING 1920 THE GENERAL NEGRO DEATH RATE IS 21 PER THOUSAND AS COMPARED WITH 1288 PER THOUSAND FOR WHITES THE EXPECTA TION OF LIFE FOR WHITE MALES IS 46 YEARS FOR NEGRO MALES 37 YEARS FOR WHITE FEMALES 52 YEARS FOR NEGRO FEMALES 39 YEARS THUS THE COLORED CHILD STARTS OUT IN LIFE UNDER A HANDICAP AS THE FORCES THAT MAKE FOR LONGEVITY ARE LESS APT TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH HIS ENVIRON MENT THAN THEY ARE WITH THAT OF THE WHITE CHILD THESE FIGURES SUGGEST TOO A LACK OF CENTERS FOR INSTRUCTION AND LACK OF PAR TICIPATION IN THE EXISTING AGENCIES DE SIGNED FOR THIS PURPOSE AN INTENSIVE CAMPAIGN OF EDUCATION AND A CONSTRUC TIVE PROGRAM OF SERVICE TO REDUCE NE GRO INFANT MORTALITY IN NEW YORK CITY CONDUCTED IN 1915 BY THE VARIOUS SOCIAL AGENCIES THERE LED BY THE CITY DEPART MENT OF HEALTH RESULTED IN TWO YEARS TIME IN A REDUCTION OF NEGRO INFANT MORTALITY FROM 202 PER 1000 BIRTHS TO 173 PER 1000 BIRTHS COLORED CHILDREN IN COMMUNI TIES OF THEIR OWN THE OBVIOUS DIFFICULTIES FOR COLORED CHILDREN IN CONNECTION WITH THE UNSANI TARY QUARTERS IN WHICH THEY ARE PLACED ARE BUT A PART OF THE PROBLEM NEGROES WHETHER IN THE SOUTH OR NORTH ARE IN THE MAIN MOST EFFECTUALLY ISOLATED FROM THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY IN WHAT MANY PERSONS ARE FOND OF REFER RING TO AS COMMUNITIES OF THEIR OWN HERE DETERIORATION IS PERMITTED TO PRO CEED WITHOUT THE BOLSTERING INFLUENCE OF MUNICIPAL REGULATION OR PRIVATE CAPITAL THEY ARE THE NEGRO QUARTERS AND CONSEQUENTLY NEITHER FORCE NOR MERIT ATTENTION IN MANY SOUTHERN CITIES MUNICIPAL NEGLECT HAS BECOME NOTORI OUS IN NORTHERN CITIES THESE NEGRO 144PROBLEMS OF THE COLORED CHILD NEIGHBORHOODS BECOME A DUMPING GROUND FOR THE VICIOUS AND DEMORALIZ ING AGENCIES OF THE CITY WHITE AS WELL AS BLACK WHICH SEEK SUCH PLACES BE CAUSE OF THEIR IMMUNITY FROM POLICE IN TERFERENCE AND EFFECTIVE PUBLIC PROTEST A REPORT OF THE CHICAGO VICE COM MISSION DEPRECATING THE FORCED ASSO CIATION OF THE NEGRO POPULATION WITH VICE SAID THE HISTORY OF THE SOCIAL EVIL IN CHICAGO IS INTIMATELY CONNECTED WITH THE COLORED POPULATION INVARIABLY THE LARGEST VICE DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN CREATED IN OR NEAR SET TLEMENTS OF COLORED PEOPLE    SO WHENEVER PROSTITUTES CADETS AND THUGS WERE LOCATED AMONG WHITE PEOPLE AND HAD TO BE MOVED FOR COMMERCIAL OR OTHER REA SONS THEY WERE DRIVEN TO UNDESIRABLE PARTS OF THE CITY THE SOCALLED COLORED RESIDENTIAL SECTIONS NO DISCRIMINATION IS EXERCISED IN THE CLASSIFICATION OF NEGROES THEY ARE ALL NEGROES AND THEIR CHILDREN MUST LIVE WITHIN THESE CONFINES EXPOSED TOTHE UNDERMINING INFLUENCE OF THE VICIOUS ELEMENTS OF WHITE AS WELL AS COLORED CRIME AND CORRUPTION HOW ACTIVE THESE INFLUENCES ARE MAY BEST BE OB SERVED FROM A STUDY OF THE JUVENILE DELINQUENCY FIGURES FOR NEGROES PROBLEM OF JUVENILE DELINQUENCY IN NEW YORK THE NEGRO POPULATION IS 27 PER CENT OF THE TOTAL POPULATION OF THE CITY IN 1920 NEGROES CONTRIB UTED HOWEVER 33 PER CENT OF THE JUVENILE DELINQUENCY IN CHICAGO THE NEGRO POPULATION IS 45 PER CENT OF THE TOTAL IN 1920 THE NEGROES CONTRIBUTED 99 PER CENT OF THE JUVENILE DELINQUENCY THE OFFICER OF A JUVENILE COURT IN ONE OF THE LARGE CITIES OF THE NORTH IN EX PLAINING THE HIGHER DELINQUENCY RATE AMONG NEGRO CHILDREN ATTRIBUTED IT TO THE CRIME BREEDING ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THEY HAVE TO LIVE LACK OF PRI VACY AT HOME WORKING PARENTS AND CONSEQUENT LACK OF HOME SUPERVISION IT SHOULD BE STATED HOWEVER IN DE FENSE OF THE NORMAL LAWABIDING IN CLINATION OF THE COLORED CHILD THAT IN NEW YORK CITY IN 1915 COLORED CHILDREN CONTRIBUTED ONLY 17 PER CENT OF THE TOTAL JUVENILE DELINQUENCY WHILE THE NEGRO POPULATION WAS OVER 2 PER CENT OF THE TOTAL POPULATION OF THE CITY SOCIAL STUDIES RECENTLY HAVE BEEN POINTING OUT THE RELATION BETWEEN DE LINQUENCY AND RECREATION THE PROVI SION OF PLAYGROUNDS AND RECREATION CEN TERS IN CHICAGO FOR EXAMPLE REDUCED DELINQUENCY ON AN AVERAGE OF 44 PER CENT IN THE SECTIONS OVER WHICH THEIR INFLUENCE EXTENDED A CLEVELAND STUDY DISCOVERED THAT IN 75 PER CENT OF THE CASES OF DELINQUENCY THERE WAS A DIRECT RELATION BETWEEN THIS DELINQUENCY AND THE CHILDRENS SPARE TIME THUS AN OTHER PROBLEM WITH NEGRO CHILDREN ALSO ARISES FROM THE GENERAL ABSENCE OF RECREATIONAL FACILITIES IN NEGRO ENVIRON MENT THE HARLEM SECTION OF NEW YORK CITY IN WHICH MORE THAN 75000 NE GROES LIVE HAS NOT A SINGLE REGULARLY EQUIPPED PLAYGROUND CHICAGO PLAY GROUNDS PRACTICALLY SKIRT THE NEGRO RESIDENCE AREAS AND IN TWO INSTANCES WHERE LARGE PUBLICLY MAINTAINED RECRE ATION CENTERS ARE LOCATED ON THE EDGE OF A THICKLY POPULATED NEGRO NEIGHBOR HOOD THE HOSTILE SENTIMENT AND INTIMI DATIONS BY WHITES WHO VISIT THE CENTERS PREVENT ANY USE OF THEM BY NEGRO CHILDREN THE LACK OF THESE PROVISIONS IS NOT WHOLLY DUE TO DELIBERATE NEGLECT NE GROES IT MUST BE REMEMBERED USUALLY LIVE IN THE OLDEST SECTIONS OF THE CITY WHERE PROPERTY VALUES HAVE DECLINED TO THE SIZE OF THEIR PURSES AND WHERE IM PROVEMENTS USUALLY HAVE CEASED GEN ERAL COMMUNITY IMPROVEMENTS AS WELL AS NEW RECREATIONAL CENTERS ARE USUALLY PLACED OUTSIDE OF SUCH SECTIONS BUT THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS ENTERING 145THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY INTO THE DELINQUENCY PROBLEM A PROMINENT CAUSE ASSIGNED FOR DELIN QUENCY AMONG NEGRO CHILDREN IS PAR ENTAL NEGLECT MUCH OF THIS HAS BEEN FORCED BY THE NECESSITY FOR BOTH PAR ENTS TO WORK THE ECONOMIC STRUGGLE THUS MANIFESTS ITSELF THE WIFE MUST SUPPLEMENT THE INCOME OF THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY IN CITIES WHERE THERE IS LAX ENFORCEMENT OF THE COMPULSORY EDUCA TION LAWS OR NO SUCH LAWS THE CHILDREN THEMSELVES ARE PRESSED INTO THE SERVICE OF SUPPORTING THE FAMILY ALTHOUGH THIS IS MORE PATENTLY AN ECONOMIC THAN A RACIAL QUESTION THE PRESSURE OF THIS NECESSITY IS MOREWIDELY DIFFUSED AMONG THIS GROUP BECAUSE RELATIVELY IT COM PRISES SO LARGE A SECTION OF THE WHOLE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY THE INCENTIVE FOR CONTINUING IN SCHOOL IS MUCH DAMPENED BY THE AP PARENT LACK OF OPPORTUNITY TO UTILIZE SPECIAL TRAINING THE DOORS OF INDUSTRY AND BUSINESS ARE EFFECTUALLY BARRED AGAINST NEGROES EXCEPT IN THE LOWER AND MORE MENIAL BRANCHES OF WORK PERSISTENT EFFORT TO EXTEND THE FIELD OF OPPORTUNITY BY NEGRO ORGANIZATIONS AND THE NECESSARY ADMISSION OF NEGROES TO MANY COVETED POSITIONS DURING THE LABOR SCARCITY OF THE EARLY DAYS OF THE WAR HAVE ACCOMPLISHED SOME ADVANCE MENT IN THIS LINE BUT THE MAJOR DIFFICUL TIES ARE STILL BUT SLIGHTLY AFFECTED SUCH WAS APPARENT IN A STUDY RECENTLY MADE OF NEGRO WOMEN IN INDUSTRY IN NEW YORK CITY IN THE GROUP OF COLORED WOMEN STUDIED WERE MANY WHO HAD COMPLETED ELEMENTARY SCHOOL COURSES HIGH SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES BUT WHEREAS OF THE WHITE AND COLORED WOMEN STUDIED 8 PER CENT MORE COLORED HAD FINISHED ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND 9 PER CENT MORE HAD ATTENDED HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE BUT FEW OF THE COLORED WOMEN HAD BEEN ABLE TO USE THEIR SPECIAL TRAINING THE REPORT STATES BUT FEW OF THE SPECIALLY TRAINED WOMEN FOUND WORK IN THE TRADE FOR WHICH THEY HAD BEEN PREPARED OCCASIONALLY THEY FOUND THEIR NICHE THROUGH THE PLACEMENT DEPART MENT OF THE SCHOOLS AND SOMETIMES THROUGH PERSONAL INITIATIVE NINE TRADETRAINED WOMEN ENTERED THE POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT UNDER CIVIL SERVICE EXAMINATION OTHERS DISCOURAGED BY SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS AND THE HANDICAP OF COLOR TOOK PLACES AS LADIES MAIDS ELEVATOR OPERATORS ETC ONE WOULD HAVE TO WAIT IN AN EMPLOY MENT BUREAU FOR MANY DAYS TO HEAR OF EVEN ONE REQUEST FOR A COLORED BOOKKEEPER OR STENOGRAPHER YET A NUMBER OF WOMEN HAD BEEN SPECIALLY TRAINED AS STENOGRAPHERS THESE FINALLY ENTERED FACTORIES DOING UN SKILLED MONOTONOUS WORKTHEIR SPIRITS BROKEN AND HOPES BLASTED BECAUSE THEY HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO FORFEIT THEIR TRAINING ON AC COUNT OF RACE PREJUDICE SCHOOL TEACHERS WERE AMONG THESE NEW RECRUITS IN BOTH SKILLED AND UNSKILLED INDUSTRIES SOME HAD BEEN GRADE TEACHERS TWO HAD TAUGHT IN HIGH SCHOOL AND ONE HAD BEEN A SUPERVISOR IN A NORMAL SCHOOL SUGGESTIONS OF OTHER SPECIAL DIFFICULTIES IT IS APPARENT THAT PROBLEMS OF THE NEGRO CHILD ARE SPECIAL ONLY IN SO FAR AS THE GENERAL ATTITUDE OF THE PUBLIC IN FLUENCED BY TRADITIONAL RACIAL SENTI MENT HAS OPERATED TO MAKE THEM SO WHEN NEGROES ARE ISOLATED FROM THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY AS A GROUP DIF FERENT AND DISTINCTIVE WITH A MODE OF TREATMENT FOR THEM ALREADY OUTLINED NEGLECT AND INDIFFERENCE ARE EXPECTED FOR THEY ARE MORE AN APPENDIX THAN A FUNCTIONAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY THUS IT IS THAT GENERAL SOCIAL ORGANIZA TIONS AS A RULE CONDUCT THEIR ACTIVITIES OVER THE HEADS OF THE NEGRO COMMU NITY WHICH IS BY NO MEANS SEPARATE AND DISTINCT BY CHOICE IN CINCINNATI FOR EXAMPLE WHERE THE NEGRO JUVENILE DELINQUENCY RATE IS 12 PER CENT OF THE TOTAL WHILE THE NEGRO POPULATION IS ONLY 7 PER CENT PROBA TION WORK TOUCHED BUT FIFTEEN NEGRO 146HELPING THE FARMER THROUGH HIS CHILDREN CASES THE JUVENILE PROTECTIVE SOCIETY OF CHICAGO DOES NOT COVER THE AREAS OF NEGRO RESIDENCE MOVEMENTS LIKE THE BOY SCOUTS GIRL SCOUTS BROTHERHOOD REPUBLICCHARACTER BUILDERS OF YOUTH INDIFFERENTLY TOUCH THE LIVES OF NEGRO YOUTHS WHEN THE SERIOUSNESS OF NEGRO CASES REACHES THE POINT OF DEMANDING INSTITU TIONAL CARE OTHER DIFFICULTIES APPEAR IN MOST NORTHERN COMMUNITIES COLORED AND WHITE CHILDREN ARE ACCEPTED BY THE SAME INSTITUTIONS USUALLY THE PROPOR TION OF NEGROES IS SMALLER BOTH IN PRO PORTION TO THE NEGRO POPULATION AND IN PROPORTION TO THE CASES OF NEGROES RE QUIRING INSTITUTIONAL CARE FOR NEGRO FEEBLEMINDED THERE IS LITTLE CARE IN THE NORTH AND PRACTICALLY NONE IN THE SOUTH THE SUPERINTENDENT OF ONE NORTHERN INSTITUTION FOR THE CARE OF FEEBLEMINDED EXPRESSED A VIEW THAT MANY NEGRO CHILDREN THOUGHT TO BE FEEBLEMINDED WERE NOT REALLY SO BUT ONLY APPEARED SO BY COMPARISON WITH WHITE STANDARDS HOW FAR THIS MISAP PREHENSION UNDOUBTEDLY SHARED BY OTHERS HAS OPERATED TO AFFECT THE VOL UME OF PRESENT NEGRO FEEBLEMINDED IN INSTITUTIONS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY COMMENTING ON THE ALARMING INADE QUACIES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTH HASTINGS H HART DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CHILDHELPING OF THE RUSSELL SAGE FOUNDATION SAYS THIS IS A MATTER OF GREAT MOMENT BECAUSE THE NEGLECTED FEEBLEMINDED COLORED CHIL DREN SWELL THE RANKS OF PAUPERS CRIMINALS AND VICIOUS PERSONS AND ALSO SPREAD SOCIAL DISEASE IT APPEARS TO ME EXTREMELY IM PORTANT THAT THE SOUTHERN PEOPLE SHOULD BE COME AWARE OF THE FACT THAT IN NEGLECTING THE COLORED CHILDREN THEY ARE HAZARDING THE INTEREST OF THE WHITE POPULATION ALMOST AS MUCH AS THAT OF THE NEGRO POPU LATION APPEALS FOR PARTICIPATION BY NEGROES IN SOCIAL SERVICE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN DI RECTED ON THE BASIS OF EXPERIMENTS DEMONSTRATING THAT WHERE NEGRO CHIL DREN ARE PROVIDED WITH THE SAME PRO PHYLACTICS THEIR HEALTH CRIME ILLITERACY AND DEPENDENCY RATES ARE REDUCED TO PROPORTIONS COMPARABLE WITH THOSE OF WHITE CHILDREN THE CRUX OF THE PROB LEM HOWEVER IS THE UNYIELDING BLOC OF PUBLIC DISINTEREST AND OPPOSITION WHICH HOLDS FAST TO TRADITIONAL RESTRAINTS BOTH ECONOMIC AND SENTIMENTAL AND WHICH MAKES THE NEGROS STRUGGLE FOR EXIST ENCE MORE SEVERE HELPING THE FARMER THROUGH HIS CHILDREN 100000000 WORTH OF CHILDREN ON THE FARM BY OWEN R LOVEJOY LLD GENERAL SECRETARY NATIONAL CHILD LABOR COMMITTEE THE NATIONAL CHILD LABOR COM MITTEES INTEREST IN THE COUNTRY CHILD IS NO NEW THING AND YET WE STILL FIND PEOPLE TO WHOM IT IS A SHOCK TO DISCOVER THAT FARMWORK MAY BE CON SIDERED CHILD LABOR FOR IN THE MINDS OF MANY PEOPLE THOSE WORDS CHILD LABOR STILL CALL UP ONLY THE PATHETIC IMAGE OF A HAGGARD AND WIZENED CHILD OF SEVEN YEARS OR IT MAY BE TEN OR TWELVE DRAGGING AN ENORMOUS DINNER PAIL INTO A FACTORY AT DAWN AND IT IS TRUE THAT FOR YEARS THE PLIGHT OF THE FAC TORY CHILD OR AT LEAST THE CHILD ENGAGED IN THOSE PURSUITS COMMONLY CLASSIFIED AS INDUSTRIAL HAS BEEN EMPHASIZED AL MOST TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL OTHER CHIL DREN BUT THIS DOES NOT NECESSARILY IN 147

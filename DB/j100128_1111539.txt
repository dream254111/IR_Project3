part of the vendor Sills v Hawes 1899 14 Colo App 157 59 Pac 422 Oppenheimer v Moore 1905 107 App Div 301 95 N Y Supp 138 Tru man v Threshing Machine Co 1912 169 Mich 153 135 N W 89 Here the ques tion of good faith is for the jury 3 That the vendor deemed himself insecure Thorp v Fleming 1908 78Kan 237 96 Pac 470 see Koster v Seney 1897 100 Iowa 558 69 N W 868 Here the question of good faith may not be inquired into and the vendor may therefore act arbitrarily The first of these views does not appear to give the vendor all that he contracted for whereas the third appears to be unnecessarily harsh on the vendee The second view most nearly approximates what is fairest to the interests of both parties SALESRISK OF LossGOODS SHIPPED TO ORDER NoTIFYThe plaintiff sold a quantity of lime to the defendant f o b a vessel to be supplied by the buyer at the sellers place The seller shipped the lime to order notify defendant and at taching the bill of lading in the sellers name to a sight draft sent them through a bank for collection The goods were lost in transit and the vendor sued for the price Held the seller retained title by the bill of lading for his protection until payment of the draft Risk follows the title and is on the seller Pennimaan v Winder N C 1920 103 S E 908 The title in the goods would have passed to the buyer on shipment but for the bill of lading Sales Act 19 rule 4 subd 2 Fragano v Long 1825 4 B  C 219 Where goods shipped are by the bill of lading deliverable to the seller or order the seller thereby reserves the property But if except for the form of the bill of lading the property would have passed to the buyer on shipment under the Sales Act the sellers property is held to be only for the purpose of securing per formance and the risk is on the buyer from the time of delivery to the carrier Sales Act 20 subd 2 22 subd a Alderman Bros v Westinghouse Air Brake Co 1918 92 Conn 419 103 Atl 267 Kinney v Horowitz Md 1919 105 Atl 438 North Carolina has not adopted the Sales Act but the same result has been reached at common law Browne v Hare 1858 3 H  N 484 A few holdings support the principal case William Mercantile Co v Fussy 1895 15 Mont 511 39 Pac 738 Cragun Bros v Todd  Kraft 1906 131 Iowa 250 108 N W 450 These cases fail to distinguish between the retention of possession called title by the courts for the purpose of security only and the reservation of full ownership In the former the risk is on the buyer Williston Sales 1909 419 463 The seller retains a right to possession and a power of disposal but some of the elements of title which is an aggregate not an indivisible mass are in the buyer In North Carolina the risk was held to be on the buyer in a conditional sale where the seller retained title for the purpose of securing himself Whitlock v Auburn Lumber Co 1907 145 N C 568 58 S E 909 It is difficult to see how the court in the prin cipal case can reconcile these two holdings since the position of the vendor is analogous in both cases SALESTRANSIER OF TITLEUNDERPAYMENT DUE TO MISTAKEThe plaintiff sold the defendant fifty bales of cotton for cash but due to a mutual error in adding the weights of the bales payment was made by draft for ten thousand pounds less than was actually delivered On the defendants refusal to pay the balance of the price on the basis of correct addition of weights the plaintiff brought trover for the ten thousand pounds The court held title passed to the defendant on the delivery of the cotton suggesting that contract was the proper action King v Adams C C A 8th Cir 1920 265 Fed 9 Ordinarily in a cash sale title does not pass until payment However an un 101102 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW restricted delivery waives this condition unless a contrary intention appears See In re Perpall C C A 1919 256 Fed 758 760 People v Mills Sing Cal 1919 183 Pac 865 867 But here no such contrary intention appears Since the par ties agreed upon the price per pound and the number of bales the mistake in pay ment was merely in the performance of the contract Therefore title passed on the delivery of the goods and the receipt of the draft The dictum of the court that the appropriate remedy was contract is sound Where the vendor through a mis take in computation offers his goods at a certain lump sum he is held to that figure Tatum v Coast Lumber Co 1909 16 Ida 471 101 Pac 957 Griffin v ONeilt 1892 48 Kan 117 29 Pac 143 unless the vendee knew or should have known of the error when he accepted Adkins  Co v Campbell 22 Del 1906 6 Penn 96 64 Atl 628 But where the vendor has performed and the mistake is merely in the computation of the total due under the agreement he may recover the unpaid balance Union Electric Light Co v Surgical Supply Co 1907 122 Mo App 631 99 S W 804 Alleghany County v Thoma 1906 31 Pa Super Ct 102 In the principal case since the price per pound was evidently agreed upon and the vendee should have known of the mistake in computation the vendor can recover the balance of the correct contract price The defendant contracted to pay for fifty bales at a certain price per pound and is bound to do so Cf Union L Co v J W Schonten  Co 1919 25 Cal App 80 142 Pac 910 SPECIFIC PERFORMANCEWANT OF MUTUALTYNEW YORK RULEA landlord orally agreed with his tenants that if they should make certain extensive improve ments in the property he would give them an option to extend the lease for five years and would reduce the agreement to writing The tenants made the im provements and now bring a bill ito compel the landlord to execute the written agreement Held the tenants are entitled to specific performance Stone v 434 Broadway Corp Sup Ct Special Term 1920 184 N Y Supp 116 Specific performance of affirmative obligations is properly refused where the court is unable to enforce complete performance of the contract Wakeham v Barker 1889 82 Cal 46 22 Pac 1131 personal service Flight v Bolland 1828 4 Russell 299 infancy 1917 17 COLUMBIA LAW REv 549 The defendant should not be compelled to perform where he is left without remedy or with only an action at law in case of breach by the plaintiff 1903 3 COLUMBIA LAW REV 1 1916 16 COLUMBIA LAW REV 442 445 The defect in the plaintiffs bill may be termed want of mutuality of performance The New York courts have extended this doctrine to cases where the court has the power to compel complete perform ance but the defendant could not have filed a bill to compel the plaintiff to perform 328 East 26th Street Realty Co v Kahn Sup Ct 1920 184 N Y Supp 95 Schuyler v KirkBrown Realty Co 1920 184 N Y Supp 95 Wadick v Mace 1908 191 N Y 1 83 N E 571 The alleged defect here may be termed want of mutuality of obligations The courts failed to realize that the plaintiff by com ing into court has waived his immunity so that the court may now compel him to perform In the principal case however the plaintiff has already performed and even in New York this is held to entitle him to specific performance Brune v Von Lehn 1920 112 Misc 342 183 N Y Supp 360 McKinley v Hessen 1911 202 N Y 24 95 N E 32 The performance must be substantial and in direct execution of the agreement See McKinley v Hessen supra Wheeler v Reynolds 1876 66 N Y 227 231 The courts do not discuss mutuality but base their de cision upon the ground that where the defendant has stood by and permitted the plaintiff to perform it would be inequitable to allow him to avoid performance on his own part See Woolley v Stewart 1918 222 N Y 347 351 118 N E 847 848 The New York courts are correct in granting specific performance where the plain

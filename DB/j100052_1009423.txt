VOTED AT THE PRIMARIES OF ANY OTHER PARTY LATER THAN JANUARY I 1898 THERE IS HOWEVER TO BE A SUPPLEMENTAL ENROLLMENT ON THE SECOND TUESDAY IN MAY AND THIS SHORTENS CONSIDERABLY THE PERIOD OF PROBATION THOSE WHO ARE UNABLE TO ENROLL IN OCTOBER 1899 AS A RESULT OF HAVING PAR TICIPATED IN THE PRIMARIES OF SOME OTHER PARTY DURING THE PRECEDING YEARI898WILL BE ABLE TO ENROLL AT THE SUPPLEMENTAL ENROLLMENT IN MAY 1900OO SINCE AT THAT TIME THE PRECEDING YEAR WILL MEAN 1899 INSTEAD OF 1898 FROM THIS IT APPEARS THAT THE MINIMUM PERIOD OF PROBATION WHICH A VOTER MUST PASS THROUGH IN ORDER TO BECOME A MEMBER OF A NEW PARTY IS ONE YEAR AND FOUR MONTHSFROM THE FIRST OF JANUARY TO THE SECOND TUESDAY IN MAY OF THE FOLLOWING YEAR IN EFFECT THIS MEANS THAT THE VOTER WHO DESIRES TO CHANGE HIS PARTY AFFILIATIONS MUST PASS ONE CALENDAR YEAR WITHOUT PARTICIPATING IN THE PRIMARIES OF ANY PARTY NO ONE HOWEVER WILL LOSE HIS PARTY STANDING BY JOINING AN IN DEPENDENT MUNICIPAL ORGANIZATION SUCH AS THE CITIZENS UNION AS ONLY THOSE ORGANIZATIONS WHICH POLLED OVER IO OOO VOTES FOR GOVERNOR AT THE LAST STATE ELECTION ARE POLITICAL PARTIES WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE LAW FURTHERMORE NO ONE WILL

DECLARE UNDER OATH OR AFFIRMATION THAT HE IS THE PERSON HE REPRESENTS HIMSELF TO BE AND THAT HE RESIDES AND HAS FOR THIRTY DAYS PAST RESIDED AT THE ADDRESS GIVEN AS HIS RESIDENCE IN ORDER TO PRESERVE THE SECRECY OF THE BALLOT A PLAN HAS BEEN ADOPTED WHICH PERMITS GREATER FREEDOM OF VOTING THAN THE AUSTRA LIAN SYSTEM AND AT THE SAME TIME RELIEVES THE CITY OF THE EXPENSE OF PRINTING BALLOTS ANYONE WHO DESIRES MAY PREPARE A TICKET AND HAVE IT PRINTED BUT ALL BALLOTS MUST BE OF A GIVEN SIZE WEIGHT AND TEXTURE OF PAPER AND THOSE OF EACH PARTY OF A SPECIFIED COLOR SO THAT WHEN THEY ARE FOLDED THE BALLOTS OF DIFFERENT PARTIES WILL BE EASILY DISTINGUISHABLE WHILE ALL THOSE OF THE SAME PARTY PRESENT THE SAME APPEARANCE AT THE OPENING OF THE POLLS ALL BALLOTS INTENDED FOR USE AT THE ELECTION MAY BE DEPOSITED WITH THE INSPECTORS WHEN AN ELECTOR PRESENTS HIMSELF AND DECLARES HIS DESIRE TO VOTE HE MUST ANNOUNCE HIS NAME RESIDENCE AND PARTY AND THEN IF THE INSPECTORS FIND HIM DULY ENROLLED THEY WILL DELIVER TO HIM UNFOLDED ONE OF EACH OF THE BALLOTS OF HIS PARTY HAVING RECEIVED THE BALLOTS THE ELECTOR WILL RETIRE TO A BOOTH AND SELECT THE ONE WHICH HE DESIRES TO VOTE WHEN HE LEAVES THE BOOTH ALL THE BALLOTS MUST BE FOLDED SO THAT THE NAMES WILL BE CONCEALED HE MUST FIRST DELIVER TO THE INSPECTORS THE BALLOT WHICH HE INTENDS TO VOTE AND AS SOON AS IT IS IN THE BALLOT BOX HE MUST DELIVER UP ALL THE OTHERS WHICH WILL BE PLACED IN A BOX PROVIDED FOR THE PURPOSE AND AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THE CANVASS BURNED WITHOUT EXAMINATION IF THIS SYSTEM IS PROPERLY CARRIED OUT NO OBSERVER WILL BE ABLE TO TELL WHICH OF THE BALLOTS AN ELECTOR VOTES AND THUS THE VOTING WILL BE NO LESS SECRET THAN UNDER THE AUSTRALIAN SYSTEM MOST OF THE DETAILS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN NOTICED HERE ARE SUBSTAN TIALLY THE SAME AS AT REGULAR ELECTIONS WHEREVER HONEST RESULTS ARE SECURED BY THE GENERAL ELECTION SYSTEM THERE IS NO APPARENT REASON WHY EQUALLY SATISFACTORY RESULTS SHOULD NOT BE OBTAINED FROM THE SAME PRINCIPLES AS APPLIED TO PRIMARY ELECTIONS PHILADELPHIA WALTER J BRANSON PH ILADE LP K IA

request of the Editor of The Condor for publication in that journal While not to be regarded as a complete autobiography they touch upon the main incidents and activities of the authors life particularly his ornithological work in the far west the chief field of interest of the journal in which they are to appear Their principal value to the reader will come from the side lights they may throw on the character and work of the mensome well known and others scarcely known at allwhom the author has been privileged to meet and also the knowledge they may confer on the intimate personal history of times long past and now existent in the memories only of the very few Judging from his own tastes and present experience the author is of the opinion that the writing of autobiographies will never become a popular form of amusement Nevertheless fresh as he is from the difficulties attending the fixing of dates and events belonging to the dim past he cannot but feel that regardless of their own preferences scientific men if no others owe this duty to their own and future timesa duty not to be lightly thrust aside February 3 1919 EARLY LIFE As a mans career in the world is more or less closely connected with the place of his nativity I may as well state at the outset that I was born in Cambridgeport Massachusetts March 3 1850 the last of seven children The windows of our house overlooked the marshes and tidal basin of the river Charles and from it was visible the dome of the Boston State House Thus I may fairly claim to be a Yankee by birth and as every genuine Yankee is wont to trace his ancestry back to the Mayflower I may boldly claim the same distinction at least on my mothers side It is often said of one who displays special aptitude for a particular pur suit or calling as artist musician lawyer or what not that he is born to it meaning perhaps that his tastes and abilities are inherited If there be any truth in the saying it would seem to apply with special force to the naturalist although I do not doubt that his tastes even if inherited are greatly strength ened or modified by particular environment or circumstances For myself I seem to have inherited directly from my mother my love of nature and my desire to study her ways Though no naturalist and with little or no exact knowledge of any branch of natural history she possessed neverthe less an innate love of nature and a sympathy for all her creatures From her I received my first lessons as an observer when she used to direct my attentionMay 1919 AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL NOTES 103 as a child to the beauty of the bark and foliage of trees and point out their individuality and infinite variety of form and color What seems to me even more remarkable she taught me to see and admire their wierd beauty after Fig 24 HENRY W HENSHAWIN 1913 they were stripped of their foliage especially as their branches were being bent and tossed by the eager winds of autumn and winter She never studied104 THE CONDOR Vol XXI any books of natural history so far as I know but she had a keen apprecia tion of literary excellence and was familiar with the best in English literature She was a strong admirer of Thoreaus writings which among many other good books she recommended to me while still a lad To her I owe such advantages as attach to a New England training for when my father received an advantageois offer to enter into the book business in Chicago and was inclined to the change she dissuaded him on the ground that no pecuniary advantage however great could compensate for the loss to the children of an education amid New England surroundings An older brother who fell in the civil war had made a small mineralogical collection though probably with no very definite purpose in view and more than once she suggested to me the desirability of making that my own and of adding to it But if I had any interest in minerals which I doubt it was not sufficient to impel me to study or collect them though I well remember the little cabinet in which they were stored The Charles River marshes were only a few moments walk from our house and its banks ponds and ditches were the delight of my boyhood In its waters I learned to swim and its mud banks and clam beds proved an inexhaustible source of pleasure to myself and the other boys of the neighborhood Many an afternoon we spent on its banks playing Indian the essential features of the game being a camp fire of drift wood and a goodly supply of clams dug from the mud flats at low tide for roasting or boiling after the supposed methods of the red man who long before us had utilized the very same locality as the beds of clamshells testified In the Charles River marshes too 1 learned to shoot long before I owned a gun of my own and indeed before my parents knew anything of my ambitions in that direction This was when I was about ten or twelve years old and was made possible because a chum somewhat older than I had been presented with a singlebarrelled shot gun It must have been made of good stuff for when our shot gave out we used anything we could lay our hands on for projectiles but found marbles particularly good Having assured themselves of my com petence to use a gun without endangering my own life or the lives of others I was formally commissioned as the sportsman of the family My principal game was the diminutive peeps with grass birds in the late fall and an oc casional yellowlegs or plover and though the game was small and my bags smaller still my enjoyment was immeasurable Like many other boys 1 was a lover of snakes and frequently carried them home to show to my mother or anyone else whose interest could be counted on They were chiefly green or garter snakes which in those days frequented a bit of woodland on the banks of the river known as Pine Grove This locality later became the site of the Alvin Clarke observatory where Clarke made the big lenses which in turn made his fame known to the uttermost parts of the earth Here too was the summer home of certain of our common birds includ ing the pinecreeping warbler and the purple finch with other common species which became well known to me even before I knew their names On one occasion I learned that not every one was as tolerant of the pres ence of snakes as my mother On my way home with a couple of snakes in my pocket I was accosted by a lady as to the whereabouts of a certain nearby street While I was directing her she suddenly gave a loud shriek grasped her skirts with frantic haste and fled as one who had seen a vision And in a wayMay 1919 AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL NOTES 105 so she had for one of my pets perhaps finding my pantaloons pocket too warm for comfort had climbed up under my jacket and sticking his head out of the nearest opening was gazing steadily at my interlocutor and vibrating his tongue After the manner of snakes who seek to know what is going on about them But my interest in things that walk crawl or swim does not seem to me to explain satisfactorily my very particular interest in birds nor why so far back as I can remember I was always asking the names of birds and seeking infor mation about their habits I may add that such questionings availed me little for in those days the man who knew the names of more than a half dozen com mon birds was rare indeed while books on the subject save Audubon Wilson and Nuttall were rarer still What a Godsend to me a few years later was Vol ume IX of the Pacific Railroad Reports and the Smithsonian Check List And what an ornithologist I thought myself when by its aid I had memorized the scientific names of our common birds till then as it seemed to me only half known since known only by their vernacular names FIRST MEETING WITH WILLIAM BREWSTER And so the years passed as years have the habit of doing slowly then but alas how rapidly now till the year 1865 when I entered the Cambridge High School to prepare for Harvard Up to that time I had made a small collection of pinned butterflies and moths as so many boys do and also had gathered the nucleus of a small collection of eggs In endeavoring with the aid of a class mate to establish the identity of a set of purple finchs eggs I stumbled on the fact that in our class was a boy by the name of William Brewster who not only had a collection of birds and eggs but who also knew how to stuff and mount birds Now above all earthly things the ability to stuff birds seemed to me the most to be desired but up to then I had met no one who had the art Recess was a long time coming that morning but come it did finally and at once I made my way to a young fellow pointed out to me as Brewster who was standing against the iron school fence with both arms extended along the rail ing I can see him now as I saw him then more than a half century ago Boys are not apt to be very formal and soon we were chatting about birds and their eggs The subject of stuffing birds being broached Brewster told me that he had already skinned and planned to mount that afternoon a ruddy duck and if I cared to see him work I was welcome to come to his house A trivial enough event our meeting was as it seemed then but it proved the prelude to a close friendship which has continued for more than fifty years without break or misunderstanding and is likely to continue to the end or perhaps to put it in another way to the beginning Brewster had been studying birds as well as collecting them for several years and what he had gathered already gave promise of becoming the finest private collection of birds nests and eggs ever gathered in this country This collection now numbering some forty thousand skins as I write these lines is being transferred as a gift to the Cambridge Museum of Comparative Zoology which it will permanently enrich Almost at the start Brewster and I became intimate comrades and every moment we could spare from our studies including no doubt some moments we could ill spare were devoted to the hills swamps woods and pastures of Cambridge Belmont Waltham and Concord I doubt if local ornithological106 THM CONDOR Vol XXI knowledge was ever absorbed more rapidly than by me under Brewsters tui tion and soon it was a rare event to see a bird I could not name on sight or by its song About this same time I became acquainted with Ruthven Deane whb lived hard by the Brewster place who already had the nucleus of a collection of mounted birds but who also soon abandoned the time consuming method of mounting birds on stands in favor of the quickly made birdskin His business career in Boston had already begun later to be transferred to Chicago but such spare time as he had especially holidays and Saturday afternoons was spent in the woods with his collecting gun and we had many a good tramp to gether often with Henry Purdie as a third HENRY PURDIE At that time Henry Purdie was connected with the Massachusetts State Board of Charities and his office was in the State House in Boston He also was engaged in making a small but choice collection of birds and eggs chiefly local species but I think he was always more interested in studying live birds and listening to their songs than in collecting dried skins His interest in bird literature too was strong and the advent of a new local check list or a new book on birds was always hailed with pleasure In pursuit of information on his favorite subject he spent many hours weekly in the libraries of Boston As a consequence he was remarkably well posted on general American bird litera ture and nothing pleased him better than to be called upon to share his knowl edge with and for the benefit of others He cared little for the fame of the au thor and wrote very little for publication In later years he became an excel lent field botanist and came to know the plants of the general region around Boston very well indeed He was one of the rare spirits who are happiest when serving others and it is given to but few men to make as many sincere friends as he did E A SAMUELS I fancy there were few boys who collected birds eggs round Boston in the sixties who did not know E A Samuels He was then connected with the State Agricultural Department and his office was in the Boston State House At that period he was collecting data for a book on the Birds of New England and Adjacent States the advent of which was eagerly looked for by us boys for several years Samuels was very pleasant was always ready for an ex change of eggs and ever alert for any original data that could be utilized in his forthcoming book which in large measure was a compilation though a very useful one He was a keen sportsman and an ardent fisherman and is perhaps most widely known for the many excellent articles on these subjects he wrote for sportsmans journals EMMANUEL SAMUELS Mention of the son naturally recalls to mind the father Emmanuel Samu els whom I never saw but who possesses some interest for Californians inas much as under the joint auspices of the Smithsonian Institution and the Bos ton Society of Natural History he visited California in 1855 leaving New York November 5 His mission was to make collections in all branches of natural history and in addition to gather the seeds of as many California trees and shrubs as possible for distribution over the country This latter duty was im posed upon him by the Commissioner of Patents at Washington For the Pat ent Office proved to be the birth place of that lusty offspring the DepartmentMay 1919 AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL NOTES 107 of Agriculture which did not enter upon its separate existence till July 1 1862 when the Honorable Isaac Newton was appointed first Commissioner Samuels principal collecting ground apparently was Petaluma but he vis ited Tomales Bay and probably other localities in that general region The Smithsonians share of the birds he gathered was 103 specimens and a few eggs by no means an insignificant number when are considered the multifarious du ties of the collector His memory is embalmed in the A O U Checklist under the name of Melospiza melodia saimuelis Baird Recently I had the pleasure of examining Bairds two types of the form the true one being no 5553 of the National Museum Catalogue and both skins are in excellent preservation ACQUAINTANCE WITH C J MAYNARD C J Maynard living hard by in Newtonville was then becoming active as a bird collector and dealer and Brewster and I soon made his acquaintance and from him learned to make a bird skin when the real business of collect ing birds for scientific study began for each of us The socalled New England type of bird skin was soon evolved due in no small measure to Maynards skill and was I believe so far as speed in preparation and general excellence goes superior to anything made up to that time In my eyes the final touch was at tained by the adoption of the Coues method of wrapping the green skin in filmy cotton till dry Brewster soon abandoned mounting birds on stands for the much quicker and more practical method of making skins while I had nothing to abandon being still a novice in the taxidermists art Not a single specimen of my skill as a taxidermist survives and the only triumph I achieved in that direction was a fox sparrow For its lifelike appearance I accept the authority of our house cat As the mounted bird stood drying on the mantelpiece of my bird room she mistook it for the real thing and making a wild leap secured it before realizing her mistake ACQUAINTANCE WITH R E C STEARNS It was in 1868 that I came in touch with R E C Stearns who though a New Englander by birth had lived a decade in California where he went in 1858 but was then sojourning for a time in Boston Not only was he a learned and enthusiastic conchologist but he was one of the most genial and delightful of men Though much older than I we soon became great cronies for he never became too old to love and sympathize with the aspirations of young people Many were the happy hours I spent with him in his Boston home helping him pack and unpack shells and listening to the anecdotes of which he had a rare fund including his experiences in that land of romance California Under his tutelage I became greatly interested in shells and soon had a collection largely gifts from his duplicate series Indeed he used to say that he had stolen me from the ornithologists But as I now see my interest in shells was largely due to personal association with Stearns and subsequently was replaced by the more absorbing interest in bird life The little shell collection however made at that time was not without value and now is in Wellesley College To be continued

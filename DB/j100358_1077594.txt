important applications in practical school work It is an indispensable means in the adjustment of work to individual needs and it is disclosing important facts regarding the degree of intelligence essential to suc cess in school work at various stages of progress in the educational system One purpose for which it has not yet come into extensive use is the discovery of capacity which may now be going to waste It is reported that German cities are beginning to seek out the wellendowed children graduating from the Volksschule to give them special school opportunities and to encourage them to continue their studies even to the point of subsidizing their parents when necessary The study upon which this report is based was under taken with a view to outlining a procedure that might be serviceable in the determination of the extent to which highly endowed pupils in America are being overlooked by the educational agencies of the community The school department of the city of Oakland California by means of counselors and special adjustments of the curricula to the needs of school children is making a determined effort to improve what the superintendent refers to as the holding power of the schools The proportion of children of this city who go on to high school after the completion of the eighth grade in response to these efforts is amazing Apparently it is better than 95 per cent In the course of these efforts two types of data were secured which served as a basis of this study i Every child completing the upper half of the eighth grade in the entire system was asked whether or not he was going on to high school In the case of children who reported that they were not going on a statement of the childs reason for stopping his work was secured by the counselor and forwarded to the central office 2 The Terman Group Test 776CARING FOR HIGHLY ENDOWED PUPILS 777 was given to all of the children in the upper half of the eighth grade with the object among others of sending the data on to the high school principals to facilitate their guidance of the entering classes The number of children tested in the class leaving the eighth grade last January was 1173 The data are incomplete to the extent that the children absent on the day the test was given are necessarily omitted The writer secured from the central office the written reports of the counselors regarding children not intending to continue their school work There were in all only fiftyfive reports although the class probably numbered more than twelve hundred children The reasons assigned for not entering high school are shown for these fiftyfive pupils in Table I TABLE I REASONS FOR FAILURE OF FIFTYFIVE EIGHTHGRADE GRADUATES TO ENTER HIGH SCHOOL Leaving town  8 Obviously not highschool

II778 THE SCHOOL REVIEW December As a basis of interpretation of the scores of these twentyfour pupils an evaluation of the Terman scores was made by the Bureau of Research and Guidance of the Oakland schools on the basis of the total number of children tested This classification of the test scores in terms of grade marks and ratings as made by this bureau is as follows 155 or betterA or best 5 per centvery superior I25I54B or next io per centsuperior IooI24C or next 20 per centabove average 80o99 C or next 30 per centaverage 6079  C or next 20 per centbelow average 4559 D or next io per centinferior 044 E or lowest 5 per centvery inferior The general median for the children tested was 91 Individual schools varied in median from iio to 615 While the number of children with which this study deals is not sufficient to warrant general deductions it is nevertheless interesting to note that the median for the group apparently being kept from high school by economic pressure was very low Indeed it was far below the gen eral median and very nearly as low as the poorest individual school These data perhaps again emphasize the relation between native endowment and social status It will be noted that the group of twentyfour contained no child ranking within the first 5 per cent of the entire eighthgrade group and that just onesixth of the group made scores entitling them to rank in the first 15 per cent of all the children tested Since we were interested in children so highly endowed that their failure to go on to high school would represent a definite social waste it was determined that personal inquiries should be limited to such children as made a score entitling them to the classification superior Only two additional children would have been included in this personal investigation if the above average group had been taken also In view of the fact that these two pupils were overage as well as the fact that this plan would make the group comprise 35 per cent of all those included in the distribution the procedure did not seem to be warranted Proceeding on the theory that the group test is merely diagnostic and that a small difference in score within a given class may not be1921 CARING FOR HIGHLY ENDOWED PUPILS 779 as significant as a difference of from one to three years in age the first four cases were reranked as shown in Table III A personal investigation was made of the cases of these four children and certain significant facts determined Case No 2 original number had not been considered particularly bright in school and was having home difficulties Case No 4 original number was not considered unusually gifted in school had moved and could not be located Case No i original number had home difficulties Binet intelligence quotients

two lines of reasoning it may be taken for granted that an unusually well endowed child will ordinarily not be overage at the time of entering high school furthermore it may be assumed that the fact of age is an influence in securing a high score in the group test so that the actual intelligence status is less favorable than may appear from the raw score Regarding Case No 3 original number the only child of the twentyfour about whom the prediction may safely have been made that definite social wastage was represented investigation disclosed the fact that at the last moment the counselor of her school was able to find a family with whom she might live in return for services rendered before and after school hours This child therefore en tered high school after all780 THE SCHOOL REVIEW December The report covering Case No 3 included a statement from her and the counselors comment I may go to high school I want to go very bad but last night my mother did not know whether I was going or not because my father is dead and my mother has not very much to get on with and there are six children in the family I am the oldest A very deserving Italian child Mothers Club looking after the case In order to check the prognosis that had been made on the basis of the group test this child was given the StanfordBinet Test at the age of 143 years her score indicating a mental age of 164 and an IQ of II5 It may be taken for granted that the situation found in the city of Oakland may not be regarded as typical of the country at large When the entire country can show results approximating those of Oakland we will approach the close of the period of rapid increase in attendance in high schools and settle down again to a new nor mal situation from that point of view Even though it is clear that in the city of Oakland very little educable material is being wasted it is a fair question to ask whether a society as wealthy as ours ought to allow Case No 3 to face at her age an economic struggle which even if it does not prevent further school training will surely deprive her of opportunities for the mental and social development of which she is capable While Case No 3 has been most fortunate in the opportunity which she has secured to go through high school the conditions under which she must work are at least discouraging Her house hold duties engage her full time before school in the morning and after school until eight oclock in the evening when she goes to her room and studies until ten On Saturday she is occupied practi cally all day with general house cleaning Sunday she is free at four oclock and goes home to spend the rest of the afternoon and evening with her people In school she is carrying four subjects English mathematics history and sewing and is getting on well in all but mathematics She is in danger of failing in that subjecta quite new experience to her as her grades in the elementary school were always high1921 CARING FOR HIGHLY ENDOWED PUPILS 781 When asked about the effectiveness of her evening study she re plied that she became very sleepy because prior to coming to her present work she had been in the habit of going to bed at halfpast eight Since she stated that she prepares her history lesson first in the evening because she likes it best it may be that her failure in mathematics is due to the fact that she is physically and mentally fatigued by the time she begins to study that subject Along with her highschool work and her duties in connection with earning her living Case No 3 is carrying a great deal of home worry Her mother cannot go to work as she has many children to look after Her father is dead and her uncle who has been sup porting her family is ill Her brothers and sisters ought to be helped to go through school and she realizes that the moment she has finished her own course it will be necessary for her to begin to assist them In view of the fact that the median score for the children entering the Oakland high schools in January 1921 was 91 and Case No 3s score was 142 a difference that is greater than the figures indicate because of the fact that she probably was below the average in chronological age does it seem fair to subject her to the economic struggle described Is the time approaching in America as it has evidently arrived in some parts of Germany when funds will be available to support the highly endowed children of economically incompetent parents through their years of schooling

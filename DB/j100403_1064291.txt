J100403,VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW,1064291,WAIVER IN ADVANCE OF THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,I243765,NO SAVING CLAUSE FOR SUCH A SITUATION AS THE PRESENT ONE IT WOULDL CLEARLY SEEM THEREFORE THAT THE DECISION OF THE KENTUCKY COURT IS WRONG ON PRINCIPLE REASON AND ANALOGY14 THE RULE ANNOUNCED IN THE COWLEY CASE IS BELIEVED TO BE THE TRUE ONE ANY OTHER HOLDING WOULD BE ENTIRELY OUT OF ACCORD WITH THE LONG ESTABLISHED PRINCIPLE THAT NO CONTRACT CAN BE CARRIED INTO EFFECT WHICH WAS MADE CON TRARY TO THE PROVISIONS OF LAW OR HAS BECOME ILLEGAL IN VIRTUE OF SOME SUBSEQUENT ACT OF LAW WAIVER IN ADVANCE OF THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONSTHE QUESTION OF WAIVING IN ADVANCE THE DEFENSE OF THE STATUTE OF LIM ITATIONS NATURALLY DIVIDES ITSELF INTO TWO PARTS FIRST A DISCUSSION OF THE WAIVER OF THE DEFENSE AFTER TIME HAS BEGUN TO RUN AGAINST A CLAIM AND BEFORE THE EXPIRATION OF THE STATUTORY PERIOD AND SECOND WHEN A WAIVER OF THE STATUTE IS ATTEMPTED CONTEMPORA NEOUSLY WITH THE CREATION OF THE ORIGINAL OBLIGATION THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS OF THE VARIOUS STATES ARE SIMILAR AND ALL PROVIDE FOR SOME WAY BY WHICH AFTER TIME HAS BEGUN TO RUN THE STATUTE MAY BE WAIVED THE USUAL METHOD IS BY A PROMISE OF PAYMENT IN WRITING OR AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE CLAIM IN WRITING FROM WHICH A PROMISE TO PAY MAY BE IMPLIED1 IF THE TERMS OF THE STATUTE ARE COMPLIED WITH THE DEFENSE IS EFFECTUALLY WAIVED2 THE QUESTION THAT HAS GIVEN TROUBLE IN THE SOLUTION OF THIS FIRST PROPOSITION IS WHETHER OR NOT THE BAR OF THE STATUTE MAY BE WAIVED IN ANY OTHER WAY THAN THOSE SET OUT IN THE STATUTE ITSELF THE STAT UTE OF LIMITATIONS IS A STATUTE OF REPOSE AND TO THAT EXTENT REME DIAL IT SHOULD THEREFORE RECEIVE A CONSTRUCTION THAT WILL NOT DE FEAT ITS OBJECT3 IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT WHERE A STATUTE EXPRESSLY ENUMERATES THE WAYS IN WHICH ITS EFFECT MAY BE AVOIDED IT BY IM PLICATION EXCLUDES ALL OTHER4 IN SPITE OF THESE CARDINAL RULES OF CONSTRUCTION THE MAJORITY VIEW IS THAT WHERE UPON A VALUABLE CONSIDERATION SUCH AS A FOR BEARANCE TO SUE THE DEFENDANT ORALLY AGREES TO WAIVE THE DEFENSE OF THE BAR OF THE STATUTE HE WILL THEREBY ESTOP HIMSELF FROM SETTING IT UP TO DEFEAT A CLAIM WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE BE BARRED BY TIME5 A FORTIORI WHERE THE WAIVER IS IN WRITING BUT DOES NOT CONTAIN A PROMISE TO PAY OR SUCH AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE DEBT AS FROM 14 ADLER V MILES 69 MISC 601 126 N Y SUPP 135

REP 411 NOTE NOTES 565VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW WHICH A PROMISE TO PAY MAY BE IMPLIED THIS VIEW HOLDS THE DE FENDANT ESTOPPED TO SET UP THE BAR OF THE STATUTE AS A DEFENSE6 THE DOCTRINE OF ESTOPPEL IS LIGHTED ON THE OUTER EDGE WHEN IT IS HELD THAT MERE REPRESENTATIONS NOT AMOUNTING TO A CONTRACT THAT THE DEFENDANT WILL FORBEAR FROM PLEADING THE STATUTE AND THE PLAINTIFT CHOOSES TO RELY THEREON WILL ESTOP THE DEFENDANT FROM SO PLEADING7 SOME OF THE COURTS HOLD THAT ONE CAN ESTOP HIMSELF FROM PLEADING THE STATUTE FOR AN INDEFINITE TIME8 WHILE OTHERS HOLD THAT TIME RUNS AGAINST THE ESTOPPEL9 THE REASONING OF THE COURTS SUPPORTING THIS DOCTRINE IS THAT THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS WAS NEVER INTENDED TO COVER CASES WHERE THE PLAINTIFF HAS BEEN LULLED INTO A SENSE OF PASSIVE SECURITY BY THE ACTIVE INTERVENTION OF THE DEFENDANT10 AND AS THE STATUTE IS PRIMARILY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE INDIVIDUAL IT DOES NOT CONTRAVENE PUBLIC POLICY FOR IT TO BE WAIVED ALTHOUGH THE WAIVER IS NOT IN THE FORM SET FORTH IN THE STATUTE1 THE BETTER VIEW IS THAT WHERE THE PLAINTIFF SUES ON A CLAIM ALREADY BARRED BY THE STATUTE IN ORDER TO PREVENT ITS BEING PLEADED AS A DEFENSE HE MUST SHOW A WAIVER ON THE PART OF THE DEFENDANT WHICH BY THE TERMS OF THE STATUTE WILL LIFT THE BAR2 THESE AU THORITIES ABSOLUTELY REPUDIATE THE DOCTRINE OF EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL ASSERTING THAT ONE CAN ESTOP HIMSELF ONLY FROM PROVING OR DISPROV ING A FACT THAT HE HAS DENIED OR ADMITTED AND CANNOT ESTOP HIMSELF BY A PROMISE TO DO SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE14 IT IS MAINTAINED THAT THE STATUTE ITSELF HAS PROVIDED A WAY BY WHICH ITS BAR CAN BE WAIVED AND TO ALLOW THE PARTIES TO WAIVE IT IN ANY OTHER MANNER IS CONTRARY TO PUBLIC POLICY AND VOID15 OF COURSE UNDER THIS RULING TIME BEGINS TO RUN AGAINST THE NEW PROMISE OR ACKNOWLEDGMENT AS SOON AS MADE AND IT IN TURN MAY BE BARRED TAKING UP THE SECOND DIVISION OF THE DISCUSSION WHERE IN THE ORIGINAL AGREEMENT CREATING THE CLAIM SUED ON THE DEFENDANT HAS ATTEMPTED TO WAIVE THE DEFENSE OF THE STATUTE HERE AGAIN THE AU THORITIES ARE IN CONFLICT THE MAJORITY VIEW HOLDS THAT SUCH A WAIVER WILL BE ENFORCED17 AND THAT UNLESS SOME LIMITATION IS PUT IN THE WAIVER THE DEFENDANT WILL BE FOREVER ESTOPPED TO SET UP THE STATUTE AS A DEFENSES THIS RESULT IS REACHED THROUGH THE CONCLU STATE LOAN CO V COCHRAN 130 CAL 245 62 PAC 466 7 HOLMAN V OMAHA ETC RY CO 117 IOWA 268 90 N W 833 94 AM ST REP

FOUNDED IN A WELL LEFINED PUIB LIC POLICY2 WHICH IS AGAINST THE ENFORCEMENT OF DLEMALNS AFTER SUCH A TIME HAS ELAPSED AS WOULD PLACE THE DEFENDANT IN A POSITION TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO PRODUCE EVIDENCE OF ANY DLEFENSE AS PAYMENT OR SETOFF THAT HE MIGHT HAVE AGAINST THE CLAIM21 TO ALLOW THE DEFENDANT TO WAIVE THIS DEFENSE IN THE ORIGINAL AGREE MENT WOULD SET AT NAUGHT THE WHOLESOME OBJECT OF THE STATUTE22 IT IS JUST AS HARD TO PROVE PAYMENT OF A STALE CLAIM WHICH IS EVI DENCED BY A WRITING CONTAINING A WAIVER OF A STATUTE AS IT WOULD BE TO SHOW PAYMENT OF A STALE CLAIM NOT CONTAINING THE WAIVER IF IT IS THE POLICY OF THE LAW TO BAR THE CLAIML IN THE ONE CASE IT SHOULD BE ITS POLICY TO BAR IT IN THE OTHER IT IS NO ANSWER TO SAY THE DEBTOR HAS CONSENTED TO THE WAIVER FOR HE IS AT A DISADVANTAGE AND WILL AGREE TO ANY CONDITION THROUGH WHICH HE CAN OBTAIN THE DESIRED BENEFIT THE CASE IS ANALOGOUS TO THOSE IN WHICH THE BORROWER AGREES TO WAIVE THE STATUTE OF USURY AND NO COURT HOLDS SUCH A CONTRACT TO BE VALID TO HOLD THAT THE AGREEMENT DOES NOT PREVENT THE DEFENDANT FROM PLEADING THE BAR OF THE STATUTE CANNOT HURT THE PLAINTIFF HE KNOWS OF THE STATUTE AS WELL AS THE DEFENDANT AND CAN BRING HIS ACTION BEFORE THE EX PIRATION OF THE STATUTORY TIME AND WHILE THE EVIDENCE CONCERNING THE MATTER IS FRESH THEN BY MEANS OF A JUDGMENT HE CAN KEEL HIS CLAIM OPEN

not necessary No particular form of words is nec essary to create a separate estate in a married woman It is sufficient if the in strument in any way shows that it was intended for the wife to have the property to her sole and separate use And though express trustees are usual in equitable separate estates they are not necessary If the property be given directly to the wife by apt words to create a separate estate equity will treat the husband as trustee as to such property A conveyance of land to two persons to their only use and behoof one of whom is a married woman vests in the married woman a separate estate in her share of the land 2 EQUITABLE SEPARATE ESTATELiability for debtsEvidence of intention to charge The equitable separate estate in fee in lands which a married woman holds free from any restraint on her powers of alienation is liable for the payment of debts contracted on the faith and credit of it which liability a court of equity will enforce during the coverture or after its termination and if the rents and profits of such real estate will not pay such debts in a reasonable time the land itself may be sold for that purpose The execution of a bond note or other writing for the payment of money by such married woman whether as principal or surety is sufficient evidence of an intention to charge such separate estate 3 EQUITABLE SEPARATE ESTATELiability for open accounts Where husband and wife occupy as a home the separate equitable estate in fee of the wife and husband and wife employ laborers to cultivate the land for her benefit which cultivation is necessary for her support and the enjoyment of the estate the sep arate estate is liable for such services though only evidenced by open account 4 EVIDENCEException to competency

DECISIONS 841 of the Code to revoke a license to sell liquor the notice is sufficient if it states the charges in general terms provided they are stated with sufficient certainty to ena ble the person whose license is sought to be revoked to understand the ground upon which the revocation will be asked The proceeding is a summary one and such strict and technical rules as are applied to indictments and other forms of accusa tion in criminal prosecutions will not be required A notice is sufficient which states the charges as  selling and causing to be sold to minors whiskey wine and beer 3 REVOCATION OF LIQUOR LICENSEEidenceIndictmentsfor selling to minors Sale to minors prior to date of existing license In a proceeding under sec 560 of the Code to revoke a license to sell liquor on the charge that defendant had been guilty of selling liquor to minors it is competent to offer in evidence a number of indictments found in the same court against the same defendant for selling liquor to minors and also to receive the evidence of a minor that within twelve months prior to the time when the license sought to be revoked took effect the said minor had purchased intoxicating liquors of the defendant The whole matter being heard and determined by the court it is not confined to the strict rules of evidence which obtain upon the trial of an issue before a jury but great latitude is allowed the court in order that it may be satisfied whether or not it has entrusted the sale of liquor to an unfit person or whether the privilege granted has been abused RAUB V OTTERBACKDecided at

ATTACHMENTLevyDescription of land The levy of attachment in equity on real estate must contain such general description of the real estate and describe it with such substantial accuracy that it may be easily identified when conveyed by looking alone to the levy without the aid of extrinsic evidence STAUDE AND OTHERS V KECK AND OTHERSDecided at Richmond February 6 1896Cardwell J MULTIFARIOUSNFFSSAntagonistic interests among complainantsCase at bar In dealing with the question of multifariousness courts of equity look particularly to the question of convenience in the administration of justice If this can be accomplished in the mode adopted without such injury to one or more of the parties as to render it inequitable to accomplish the general convenience at his expense the bill will not be declared multifarious But a bill to set aside as fraudulent a deed made by a husband to his wife which shows that the interests of the complainants are antagonistic to each other and prays relief not only against the husband and wife but against another defendant as to matters not connected with the supposed fraud and to settle the rights of the complainants

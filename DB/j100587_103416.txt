ACCURATE TABLE OF REFRACTIONS,I206896,169 II SOME REMARKS ON THE ALLOWANCES TO BE MADE IN ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS FOR THE REFRACTION OF THE AIR BY DR EDM HALLEY R S S ASTRONOMER ROYAL WITH AN ACCURATE TABLE OF REFRACTIONS WERE THE MEDIUM OF OUR AIR MUCH MORE IN QUANTITY OR THE FORCE OF GRAVITY MUCH GREATER THAN IT IS OR IN A WORD WERE THE REFRACTIVE POWER OF THE AIR MUCH MORE SENSIBLE THAN WE FIND IT NOTHING COULD HAVE BEEN A GREATER IMPEDIMENT TO DISCOVERIES IN ASTRONOMY FOR ALL OBJECTS APPEA RING BY REFRACTION HIGHER THAN REALLY THEY ARE TILL SUCH TIME AS THE LAWS AND QUANTITY OF THAT RE FRACTION HAD BEEN ASCERTAINED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE BEEN SECURE OF THE TRUE OBSERVED PLACE OF ANY CAELESTIAL OBJECT BUT AS IT FALLS OUT TO BE SO LITTLE THAT NONE BUT NICE INSTRUMENTS CAN PER CEIVE ITS EFFECTS IT WAS NOT DISCOVERED TO BE AT ALL TILL BERNARD WALTHERS TIME ABOUT THE YEAR 1500 NOR BROUGHT TO ANY SORT OF RULE TILL TYCHO BRAHE NOR ASCERTAINED TILL OUR WORTHY PRESIDENT MADE THE FIRST ACCURATE TABLE THEREOF THE CURVE WHICH A BEAM OF LIGHT DESCRIBES AS IT APPROACHES THE EARTH BEING ONE OF THE MOST PERPLEXT AND INTRICATE THAT CAN WELL BE PROPOSED AS DR BROOK TAYLOR IN THE LAST PROPOSITION OF HIS METHODUS INCREMENTORUM HAS MADE IT EVIDENT BY THIS TABLE IT FOLLOWS THAT THE RATIO B B OF170 OF THE SINE OF THE ANGLE OF INCIDENCE TO THAT OF THE REFRACTED ANGLE ENCREASING AS THE BEAM APPROACHES MAKES A VERY NOTABLE DIFFERENCE IN THE PLACE OF AN OBJECT NEAR THE HORIZON BUT IN OBJECTS THAT ARE MUCH ELEVATED THE REFRACTIONS BECOME SMALLAND THEIR DIFFERENCES SCARCE EXCEED A SECOND PER DEGREE SO THAT THEY ARE SUFFICIENTLY THE SAME AS IF THE INCIDENT AND REFRACTED ANGLES WERE ON THE SURFACE OF A SPHERE OF AIR OF THE SAME UNIFORM DENSITY CLOSE AD JOYNING TO THE EYE WHEN THEREFORE THE STARS ARE TWENTY DEGREES OR UPWARDS ELEVATED ABOVE THE HORIZON WE MAY TAKE IT FOR GRANTED WITHOUT SENSIBLE ERROR THAT THE SINES OF THE TRUE AND APPARENT DISTANCES FROM THE VERTEX ARE IN THE SAME CONSTANT RATIO HENCE IT WILL AP PEAR THAT THE DISTANCES OF ALL THE STARS ARE SEEN LESS THAN THEY REALLY ARE IN WHATEVER POSITION THEY ARE TAKEN AND THAT NOT LESS THAN A SECOND PER DEGREE OF THE DISTANCE THAT IS A DISTANCE OF 30 DEGREES FOR EXAMPLE IS CONTRACTED AT LEAST SO MANY SECONDS AND ONE OF 60 GR NO LESS THAN A MINUTE IF THE DISTANCES BE TAKEN BY AN INSTRUMENT THAT IS TRULY DIVIDED SO THAT WHEN MR HEVELIUS TO SHEW THE EXACTNESS OF HIS OBSERVATIONS BRINGS EIGHT DISTANCES AS TAKEN BY HIS SEXTANT WHICH EXACTLY COMPLEAT THE CIRCLE BOTH IN LONGITUDE AND RIGHT ASCENSION THE CONSEQUENCE IS REALLY QUITE OPPOSITE TO HIS DESIGN FOR IF THOSE DISTANCES WERE THE TRUE ONES THEY BEING ALL CON TRACTED BY APPEARING THROUGH A REFRACTING MEDIUM THE SUM OF THE EIGHT DIFFERENCES OF BOTH LONGITUDE AND RIGHT ASCENSION OUGHT TO FALL SHORT OF A WHOLE CIRCLE OR 360 DEGREES BY AT LEAST SIX MINUTES SO THAT I AM INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT THE SIXTY DEGREES OF MR HEVELIUSS SEXTANT WANTED ABOUT A MINUTE OF ITS TRUE QUANTITY SUCH171 SUCH AN ALLOWANCE AS THIS MAY PERHAPS BE A PROPER EXPEDIENT TO AVOID ACCOUNTING FOR REFRAC TION IN CAELESTIAL OBSERVATIONSPROVIDED THE OBJECTS BE NEARLY PARALLEL TO THE HORIZON OR AT A GOOD HEIGHT ABOVE IT FOR ALL DISTANCES OF STARS ARE CONTRACTED BY REFRACTION WHEN THEY ARE PARALLEL TO THE HORI ZON BY THE SAME CONSTANT QUANTITY BE THEY HIGH OR LOW THAT IS BY ABOUT ONE SECOND PER DEGREE THE CHORDS OF THE ARCHES OF THE REAL AND VISIBLE DISTANCES BEING ALWAYS IN THE SAME RATIO AS IS THE SINE OF THE ANGLE OF INCIDENCE TO THAT OF THE REFRACTED ANGLE AND THIS IS THE CASE WHEREIN THE REFRACTION OF THE AIR DOES LEAST AFFECT THE DISTANCES OF THE STARS WHICH DISTANCES ARE STILL MORE AND MORE CONTRACTED AS THEY ARE NEARER TO A PERPENDICULAR SITUATIONSO THAT A DIS TANCE FOR EXAMPLE OF THIRTY DEGREES LOSES BUT HALF A MINUTE IN A HORIZONTAL SITE BUT IF THE ONE STAR BE 20 DEGREES HIGH AND THE OTHER FIFTY IT WILL BE LES SENED BY ABOVE THREE TIMES AS MUCH OR BY 1 M 41 SEC IF THE ONE BE 30 AND THE OTHER 60 DEGREES HIGH THE SAME DISTANCE WILL APPEAR LESS THAN 30 DEGREES BY ABOUT ONE MINUTE THE DIFFERENCE STILL DECREASING AS THE OBJECTS ARE MORE ELEVATED ABOVE THE HORIZON BUT IN ALL CASES TO ACCOUNT FOR THE EFFECT OF THE RE FRACTION UPON THE DISTANCES OF THE STARS REQUIRES BE SIDES SOME TRIGONOMETRICAL WORK THE HELP OF THE AFOREMENTIONED TABLE WHICH I

PARIS 1671 IN 12O THE LEARNED AUTHOR OF THIS TRACT DECLARETH THAT IN IT HE HATH GIVEN A SHORT AND EASY METHOD TO LEARN WHAT IS NECESSARY TO BE KNOWN OF EUCLIDARCHIMEDES APOLLONIUSAND OF THE BEST INVENTIONS OF THE ANCIENT AND MODERN GEOMETRI CIANS OF WHICH METHOD HE HATH NOW PUBLISHT THE FIRST 9 BOOKS RESERVING TO ANOTHER TIME THE REMAINING SEVEN WHICH HE SAITH ARE TO EXPLAIN THE MORE PROFOUND AND SUB LIME INVENTIONS OF THIS SCIENCE BUT ARE NOT SO NECESSARY TO THOSE THAT HAVE A MIND TO BEGIN THE STUDY OF IT FOR WHOSE GREATER CONVENIENCY HE SEEMS TO HAVE TAKEN THE PAINS TO DIVULGE THIS FIRST PART IN WHICH HE TREATETH OF WHAT HE THOUGHT MOST CONSIDERABLE IN THE 15 BOOKS OF EUCLID AND BESIDES WHAT ARCHIMEDES HATH DEMONSTRATED OF THE QUA DRATURE OF THE CIRCLE AS ALSO THE DOCTRINE OF LOGARITHMS OF SINUSS C HE SHEWS THE ADMIRABLE PROPRIETIES OF THE NUMBERS WHICH EUCLID HATH DEMONSTRATED IN THE 78 AND 9TH OF HIS ELEMENTS HE AFFIRMS TO HAVE FOUND A NEW WAY OF TEACHING THE DOCTRINE OF INCOMMENSURABLES AND GIVEN DI RECTIONS IN FOUR OR FIVE SMALL PAGES PERFECTLY TO COMPREHEND WHAT VERY FEW PERSONS EVEN OF THOSE THAT MEDDLE WITH GEOMETRY ARE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND BESIDES THIS HE TREATETH OF DIVERS KINDS OF PROGRESSIONS CHIEFLY INSISTING ON THE TWO MOST FAMOUS ONES VIZ THE GEO METRICAL AND ARITHMETICAL AND COMPARING THEM ONE WITH ANOTHER HE TREATETH OF LOGARITHMS AND SHEWS THE ART OF THEM BY THE MEANS OF A GEOMETRICK LINE BY HIM ESTEEMD VERY USEFUL FOR THE RESOLUTION OF ALL SORTS OF ALGEBRAICAL PROBLEMS BY THE HELP OF WHICH HE SAITH TO HAVE FORMERLY SQUARED THE HYPERBOLA HE CONCLUDETH THIS FIRST PART WITH A SHORT PRACTICAL GEO METRY WHEREIN BESIDES THE MORE EASY AND MORE COMMON OPERATIONS3065 OPERATIONS HE SAITH HE HATH DELIVERED THE PRINCIPLES NOT ONLY OF MEASURING THE MAGNITUDES AND DISTANCES OF PLACES INACCESSIBLE OF MAKING THE MAP OF A PLACE OR A PROVINCE OF FINDING THE SINUSS TANGENTS AND SECANTS OF ALL ANGLES BUT IN SHORT OF COMING TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT EVER AP PERTAINS TO THIS PART OF GEOMETRY IN HIS PREFACE HE PROMISETH TO GIVE US NEXT HIS ALGEBRA HIS DOCTRINE OF CONICAL SECTIONS SPHERICKS AND STATICKS BUT ABOVE ALL TO ESTABLISH FIVE OR SIX GENERAL RULES WHENCE AFTERWARDS BY WAY OF COROLLARIES MAY BE DRAWN THE DE MONSTRATION OF AN INFINITY OF PROPOSITIONS WHICH PASS FOR GREAT ONES IN GEOMETRY WHERE HE ADDS SHALL BE FOUND THE NATURE AND MEASURE OF ASYMPTOTICK SPACES AS THE MOST ADMIRABLE KNOWLEDGE IN THE WORLD THOSE SPACES BEING OF AN EXTENT ACTUALLY INFINITE COMPRISED BETWEEN TWO LINES WHICH BEING INFINITELY PROLONGED DO NEVER MEET BUT OF WHICH YET IT MAY BE DEMONSTRATED THAT THEY ARE EQUAL TO A CIRCLE OR ANOTHER DETERMINED FIGURE SO THAT INFINITE IT SELF AS IMMENSE AND INNUMERABLE AS IT IS MAY NOTWITHSTANDING BE REDUCED TO A CALCULUS AND TO A GEOMETRICAL MEASURE AND THAT THE MIND OF MAN BEING GREATER THAN IT IS CAPABLE TO COMPREHEND IT FOR SINCE IMAGINATION CANNOT ATTAIN SO FAR AS TO REPRESENT UNTO US WHAT IS INFINITE THE DEMONSTRA TION WE MAKE OF THE NATURE AND PROPRIETIES OF THIS IMMENSE AND INFINITE ASYMPOTICK EXTENSION CONVINCETH US AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE HAVE WITHIN US A POWER CAPABLE TO REPRESENT UNTO US THIS INFINITE EXTENSION FOR SAITH HE AS FOR MEA SURING WITH A RULE AND COMPASS A FIGURE REPRESENTED UPON PAPER I MUST HAVE THIS FIGURE PRESENT TO MINE EYES AND HANDS THAT SO BY APPLYING THE INSTRUMENTS TO ITS ANGLES AND SIDES I MAY TAKE ALL THE DIMENSIONS OF IT AND SO DE TERMINE ITS MAGNITUDE EVEN SO FOR TAKING WITH THE RULE OF MY REASON THE MEASURES OF THIS ASYMPTOTICK SPACE I MUST HAVE AN IDEA THEREOF INWARDLY PRESENTED TO MY MIND AND THIS MIND BY APPLYING IT SELF AS IT WERE TO THIS IDEA AND INTERIOR FIGURE MUST TAKE THE DIMENSIONS OF IT DETERMINE ITS BIGNESS AND DEMONSTRATE ALL ITS PROPRIETIES C IN3066 IN THE SAME PREFACE THE AUTHOR DEDUCETH LARGELY WHEREIN HIS METHOD OF TEACHING GEOMETRY DIFFERS FROM THE METHODS OF OTHERS AS TO FACILITY AND INTELLIGIBLENESS WHICH WE FOR BEAR TO TRANSCRIBE BECAUSE IT WOULD TAKE UP TOO MUCH OF THAT ROOM WHICH WE SHALL NEED FOR GIVING SOME ACCOUNT OF TWO OTHER AUTHORS II REGNERUS DE GRAAF DE S U C C O P A N C R E A T I C O LUGDUNI BATAVORUM AN

OCCURRENCES THOUGH AN ACCOUNT OF IT HATH BEEN DEFERRD TOO LONG IT BEING BUT LATELY FALLEN INTO THE PUBLISHERS HANDS THE AUTHOR THEN FINDING THAT MUCH OBSCURITY WAS LEFT IN THE DOCTRINE OF LIGHT AND ESTEEMING IT RATHER COMMEN DABLE THAN PRESUMPTUOUS TO ENDEAVOR THE CLEARING OF IT ESPECIALLY IF THAT BE DONE BY EXPERIMENTS WHICH HE JUDGETH AN EXCEEDINGLY CONDUCIVE WAY FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF ALL NATURAL KNOWLEDGE UNDERTAKETH IN TWO PARTS TO DELIVER HIS TRYALS AND MEDITATIONS ON THIS SUBJECT IN THE FIRST ARE CONTAINED THE SEVERAL EXPERIMENTS WHICH MAY FAVOUR THE DOCTRINE OF THE SUBSTANTIALITY OF LIGHT TO GETHER WITH THE RATIOCINATIONS THENCE ARISING IN THE SECOND IS REPRESENTED WHAT MAY BE ANSWERED TO ALL THOSE ARGUMENTS SO AS TO SAVE THE PERIPATETICK OPINION OF THE ACCIDENTALITY OF LIGHT WHICH YET IS DONE IN SUCH A MAN NER AS THAT THE AUTHOR LEAVETH A LIBERTY TO THE JUDICIOUS REA DER TO EMBRACE WHICH OF THESE TWO OPINIONS HE SHALL THINK THE MORE PROBABLE BUT MORE PARTICULARLY IN THE FORMER PART HE EXPLAINS HOW MANY WAYS LIGHT IS PROPAGATED OR DIFFUSED VIZ NOT ONLY DIRECTLY AND BY REFRACTION AND REFLEXION BUT ALSO BY DIFFRACTION WHICH LAST ACCORDING TO HIM IS DONE WHEN THE PARTS OF LIGHT SEPARATED BY A MANIFOLD DISSECTION DO IN THE SAME MEDIUM PROCEED IN DIFFERENT WAYS NEXT HE CONSIDERS THE NATURE OF LIGHT AS ALSO D APHANEITY AND OPACITY AND TAKETH NOTICE THAT MOST BODIES WHETHER SOLID OR FLUID ARE3069 ARE POROUS ON WHICH OCCASION HE VENTURES TO EXPLAIN ALMOST THE WHOLE PHILOSOPHY OF MAGNETICKS THEN HE DISCUSSETH THE QUESTION WHETHER THE DIFFUSION OF LIGHT BE INSTANTANEOUS AND CONCLUDETH IT IN THE NEGATIVE THOUGH THE DURATION OF IT BE IMPERCEPTIBLE THIS DONE HE EXAMINES THE NATURE OF REFLEXION AND REFRACTION AND SEEMS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SUPPOSING LIGHT TO BE A SUBSTANCE VERY FLUID AND VERY SUBTILE AN ACCOUNT MAY EASILY BE GIVEN WHY IT IS REFLECTED AND RE FRACTED AND WHY IT OBSERVES SUCH LAWS IN ITS REFLEXION AND REFRACTION AS REALLY IT DOTH FURTHER HE DISCOURSETH OF COLOURS AND CONSIDERS HOW LIGHT IS CHANGED INTO COLOUR SOMETIMES BY REFLEXION ALONE SOMETIMES BY REFRACTION ALONE SOMETIMES WITHOUT EITHER AND WITHOUT THE CHANGE OF THE MEDIUM VID BY DIFFRACTION HE EXPLAINS ALSO HOW LIGHT BY THE SOLE INTRINSICK MODIFICA TION OF IT SELF PASSETH SOMETIMES INTO A COLOUR THAT IS COM MONLY CALLED APPARENT WHERE HE DECLARETH THAT THE REASON WHY LIGHT PASSETH INTO AN APPARENT COLOUR IS NOT SOME DE TERMINATE ANGLE AT WHICH THE RAYS AMONGST THEMSELVES ARE INCLINED BUT THAT THAT COLOUR IS PRODUCED BY THE INTENSION AND DENSITY OF LIGHT HE TEACHES ALSO THAT TO THE VISION OF THINGS PERMANENTLY COLOURD THERE ARE NOT REQUIRED ANY INTENTIONAL SPECIES TRANSMITTED FROM THEM AND CONTRADISTINCT TO LIGHT BUT THAT THE LIGHT WHICH IS DIFFUSED OR AT LEAST RE FLECTED FROM THINGS COLOURD IS SUFFICIENT YET WITH SUCH A MO DIFICATION AS IS TO BE FOUND IN LIGHT APPARENTLY COLOURED ON WHICH OCCASION MANY PARTICULARS ARE DELIVERED CONCERNING REFLEX VISION TOGETHER WITH AN EXPLICATION OF THAT QUAERE HOW THE PLACE OF THE THING SEEN IS PERCEIVED C TO ALL WHICH IS ADDED THAT THE MODIFICATION OF LIGHT BY WHICH IT IS BOTH PERMANENTLY AND AS THEY SPEAK APPARENTLY COLOURED OR MADE SENSIBLE UNDER THE REPRESENTATION OF COLOUR MAY NOT IMPROBABLY BE SAID TO BE A DETERMINATE AND MOST FINELY FUR ROWD UNDULATION OF THE SAME AND A KIND OF TREMULOUS DIF FUSION WITH A CERTAIN VERY SUBTLE FLOATING WHEREBY IT DOTH IN A PECULIAR WAY OF APPLICATION AFFECT THE ORGAN OF VISION WHICH IS ILLUSTRATED AND CONFIRMED BY WHAT IS BY PHILOSOPHERS F F F F 2 TAUGHT3070 TAUGHT OF SOUND AND HEARING UPON WHICH TIS INFERRD THAT COLOURS ARE NOT ANY THING PERMANENT IN VISIBLE THINGS NOT OF THEMSELVES LUCID WHEN THEY ARE NOT ILLUMINATED BUT THAT THEY ARE THE LIGHT IT SELF UNDER SOME PECULIAR MODIFICATION MADE SENSIBLE BY THE SIGHT LASTLY THIS FIRST PART IS ENDED WITH A LARGE DISCOURSE OF THE RAINBOW ITS COLOURS AND THEIR ORDER ITS CIRCULAR FIGURE THE CONCENTRICKNESS OF RAINBOWS C CONCLUDING UPON THE WHOLE THAT A RAINBOW BOTH THE PRIMARY AND SECUNDARY IS GENERATED FROM THE SOLAR RAYS REFLECTED AND REFRACTED BY THE DROPS OF A RORID CLOUD SO THAT THE PRIMARY IS REPRESENTED BY THE RAYS THAT ARE ONCE REFLECTED WITHIN THOSE DROPS BUT THE SECUNDARY BY THE RAYS TWICE REFLECTED AND WHICH AFTER A DOUBLE REFRACTION IN BOTH CASES PASS TO THE EYE PLACED IN THE AXIS OF THE RAINBOW THE SECOND PART IS DISPATCHED IN SIX PROPOSITIONS IN WHICH THE AUTHOR TAKETH PAINS NOTWITHSTANDING ALL WHAT HE HATH DELIVERED BEFORE TO ABET ARISTOTLES OPINION IMPORTING THAT LIGHT IS AN ACCIDENT THOUGH HE DISSEMBLETH NOT THAT THAT PHILOSOPHER SEEMS TO HAVE SOMEWHERE FAVOURD THE CONTRARY OPINION AS HE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGETH THAT THE EXPERIMENTS AND THE REASONS THENCE DEDUCED FOR THE SUBSTANTIALITY OF LIGHT APPROACH VERY NEAR TO A PHYSICOMATHEMATICAL EVI DENCE ESPECIALLY WITH SUCH MEN AS HAVE EITHER SKILFULLY AND CAREFULLY MADE THOSE EXPERIMENTS THEMSELVES OR ATTENTIVELY BEHELD THEM WHEN MADE BY OTHERS HOWEVER HE MAKETH A SHIFT TO SAY SOMETHING BY WAY OF ANSWER TO ALL THE ARGU MENTS PRODUCED IN THE FIRST PLACE FOR THE PROOF OF LIGHTS BEING A SUBSTANCE YET DENYING THAT THOUGH LIGHT WERE AN ACCIDENT IT WOULD FOLLOW THAT COLOURS CALLD PERMANENT ARE SOMETHING DISTINCT FROM LIGHT AND RESIDING IN BODIES WHEN LIGHT IS ABSENT IV MARCI3071 IV MARCI MEIBOMII DE FABRICA T R I R E M I U M LIBER AMSTELODAMI 1671 IN 4 THIS DISCOURSE TREATS FIRST OF THE OCCASION AND ORIGINAL OF SHIPPING AND RELATES THAT IT BEGAN WITH OARS AND THEN WAS IMPROVED BY SAILS AND AT LAST WAS PRACTISED WITH THE USE OF BOTH IN THE BEGINNING FOR CELERITY AND FIGHT THEY MULTIPLIED OARESANDFOR SOME STRENGTH THEY FORTIFYED THEIR SHIPS WITH STRONG BEAKS AS BIRDS OF PRAY HAVE STRONG WINGS AND A SHARP BEAK HE ASCRIBES TO THE SIDONIANS THE FIRST INVENTION OF BUILDING LONG SHIPS FOR WAR AND THE CONTRIVANCE OF FILLING THEM WITH OARES IN SUCH A MANNER THAT NO VOID SPACES MIGHT BE LEFT AS BROADER AND SHORTER SHIPS WERE BUILT FOR BURTHEN GALLIES HE DISTINGUISHES INTO MONOCROTA WHEREIN ONE OR MORE ROWS OF MEN DO SIT IN THE SAME LEVEL OR PLAIN AND POLYCROTA IN WHICH THE ROWERS SIT IN DIVERS HEIGHTSONE ABOVE ANOTHERAS IN AMPHITHEATERS WHENCE THE BIREMIS TRIREMIS QUADRIREMISAND SO ON TO THE TESSARACONTERIS THE BIGGEST THAT WE READ OF AND RECORDED TO HAVE BEEN MADE BY PHILOPATER IN THE MONOCROTA HE CONSIDERS THE MANNER OF THE SITTING OF THE ROWERS AND THE INTERSCALMIUM OR THE SPACE BETWEEN THE TWO OARES OF THE SAME VERSUS OR ROW REFERRING THE TRANSTRA TO THE POLYCROTA GALLEYS WHERE HE HATH OCCASION TO EXAMINE THE MEASURE OF THE GREAT AND ROMAN FOOT AND CUBIT AS ALSO TO GIVE THE MEANING OF THE WORDS VERSUS GR  OR  AND ORDO GR  NEXT HE ENDEAVORS TO EXPLAIN IN THE GALLEYS THAT ARE POLY CROTA OF 3 4 5 OR MORE TIRES OF ROWERS SEATED IN DIFFERENT HEIGHTS HOW THOSE MEN COULD BE PLACED AND HERE HE PRE TENDS TO HAVE BEEN THE FIRST THAT HATH PERFECTED THE WAY OF LES SENING THE HEIGHT OF THE ANCIENT GALLEYS BY DEVISING THESE TWO EXPEDIENTS BY THE FIRST OF WHICH SAID TO HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED BY HIM 22 YEARS SINCE HE AFFIRMS TO HAVE SHEWED SO TO PLACE THE3072 THE LATERAL ROWERS AS THAT HE THAT SITS BEHIND AN OTHER MAY MOVE HIS HANDS AND OAR UNDER THE SEAT OF THE ROWER SITTING NEXT BEFORE HIM BY WHICH MEANS THREE LATERAL ROWERSWHICH ACCORDING TO SCALIGERS WAY WOULD REQUIRE THE HEIGHT OF 1312 FEET WILL BE CONTENT WITH THE SPACE OF 712 FEET BY THE OTHER INVENTION WHICH HE NOW ADDSHE PRETENDS TO HAVE FOUND A NEW PLACE IN THOSE SHIPS FOR ALMOST HALF THE NUMBER OF ROWERS FORASMUCH AS ON THE SIDE OF THE AFORESAID ROWERS HE PLACETH OTHERS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SHIP IN TRANSTRIS OR TRA VERSE SEATS WHICH AS HE IMAGINES HOW CONSONANTLY TO USE AND PRACTICE THE INTELLIGENT SOON WILL JUDGE MAY THRUST OUT THEIR OARS UNDER THE SEATS OF THE LATERAL ROWERS BY WHICH CONTRIVANCE HE THINKS IS GAIND IN A QUINQUEREMIS THE SPACE OF NINE FEET IN HEIGHT WHICH HE SAITH SCALIGER IF ALIVE WOULD ADMIRE AND TO ALL THIS HE SUBJOYNS SOME PASSAGES OUT OF ANCIENT AUTHORS WHICH HE CONCEIVES DO MUCH STRENGTHEN THE FITNESS OF THESE INVENTIONS OF HIS CONCERNING BOTH THE PLACING OF THE LATERAL ROWERS AND THOSE THAT SIT IN TRANSTRIS HERE HE INSERTS THE EXPLICATION OF THOSE NAMES OF THALAMITA ZYGITA AND THRANITA IN THE TRIREMIS THE FIRST SIGNIFYING HIM THAT SITS IN THE LOWEST ROW THE SECOND HIM THAT SITS IN TRAN STRIS THE THIRD HIM THAT SITS UPPERMOST AFTER THIS HE INQUIRETH WHETHER EVER SUCH GREAT VESSELS OF SO MANY TIRES OF OARS SITTING IN SO MANY DIFFERENT HEIGHTS WERE EVER ACTUALLY BUILT AND IF THEY WERE WHETHER THEY EVER CAME ABROAD TO FIGHT ESPECIALLY SUCH AN ONE AS THAT OF PHILOPATORS IS RECORDED TO HAVE BEEN OF FORTY TIRES REQUIRING ABOVE FOUR THOUSAND ROWERS AND THAT OF PTOLE MAEUS PHILADELPHUS OF THIRTY TIRES HAVING MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND ROWERS AND ANOTHER OF TWENTY ROWS REQUIRING TWO THOUSAND HEREUPON OUR AUTHOR SCRUPLES NOT TO AFFIRM ALL TO BE TRUE WHAT IS WRITTEN OF SUCH VAST SHIPS ADDING THAT HE HATH MADE IT INTELLIGIBLE HOW IT MAY BE SO BY FINDING PLACES FOR THE ZYGITAE AND A CONVENIENCY OF MOVING THEIR OARS UNDER THE SEATS OF THOSE THAT SATE NEXT BEFORE THEM AND HERE HE SHEWS AT LARGE OF WHAT DETERMINATE BIGNESS THOSE VESSELS WERE ACCORDING TO HIS SUPPOSITION AND CONTRI VANCE3073 VANCE BEGINNING FROM A TRIREMIS AND SHEWING HOW MANY OARS AND SEAMEN IT CONTAINED NAMELY TWO HUNDRED OF WHICH ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY WERE ROWERS AND THE REST MARRINERS SO THAT IN THE ATHENIAN FLEET OF WHICH CONO WAS GENERAL CONSISTING OF ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TRIREMES THERE WERE FIX AND THIRTY THOUSAND MEN THEN PROCEEDING TO A QUINQUEREMIS WITH FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY MEN APIECE OF WHICH THERE WERE ROWERS THREE HUNDRED AND SOULDIERS ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SO THAT THREE THINGS WERE STUPENDI OUS IN THAT ROMAN FLEET AT MESSINA AND THE CARTHAGINIAN AT LYLIBEUM ONE IS THAT THE FORMER CONSISTED OF THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY AND THE LATTER OF THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SHIPS MOST QUINQUEREMES THAT IS AN HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET LONG THE SECOND THAT THE NUMBER OF MEN THEY CONTAINED WAS ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND AND ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND MEN THE THIRD THE APPARATUS AND PROVISION NECES SARY YET ALL THIS AFFIRMED BY ONE OF THE BEST OF THE ANCIENT HISTORIANS POLYBIUS WHO HIMSELF WONDERS AT SUCH A VAST EQUIPAGE HERE THE AUTHOR UNDERTAKETH OUT OF POLYBIUS PLUTARCH AND LIVY TO REFUTE SALMASIUS AFFIRMING THAT HARDLY ANY GAL LEYS WERE BUILT OR EQUIPPED BIGGER THAN OF NINE TIRES CALLED  HENCE HE PROCEEDS TO THE SHIPS OF ELEVEN ROWS  AND OF FIFTEEN ROWS  AND TO ONE OF SIXTEEN  HAVING DISPATCHED THESE PARTICULARS OF WHICH WE LEAVE CU RIOUS AND LEARNED ANTIQUARIES AND GOOD NAVAL ARCHITECTS TO JUDGE HE PROPOSETH THE USEFULNESS OF THESE HIS INVENTIONS AFTER THAT BY THE MEANS OF THEM BOTH THE STRUCTURE AND OR DERING OF ANCIENT SHIPPING HATH BEEN EXPLAINED AND IS OF OPINION THAT THE MODERN GALLEYS AND GALLEASSES MIGHT AC CORDING TO HIS MODEL BE MORE CONVENIENTLY BUILT BOTH FOR CELERITY STRENGTH AND LESSER EXPENCES HE THINKS THAT THE MODERN FORM WOULD BE BETTER IF IN THE STRUCTURE THE PRO PORTION OF THE LONG SHIPS OF THE ANTIENTS WERE OBSERVED AND HE CONCEIVETH ALSO THAT FIVE MEN SITTING AT ONE OAR IN THE3074 THE MODERN GALEASSESMUCH STRENGTH IS WASTED TO NO PURPOSE BECAUSE THEY SIT TOO NEAR TO THE SIDE OR STAY THE FULCRUM WHEREAS A LESSER NUMBER OF ROWERS AT A GREATER DISTANCE FROM THE SAID STAY WOULD GIVE MORE STRENGTH FOR MORE SWIFT NESS AND REQUIRE LESS CHARGE TO WHICH HE ADDS THAT THESE GALLEYS ARE OF GREAT USE BOTH IN RIVERS AND UNDEEP SEAS AND THEREFORE CONVENIENT FOR THE BALTICK AND BRITANNICK AS WELL AS THE MEDITERRANEAN SEAS FURTHER THAT THEY ARE VERY SERVICEABLE FOR TRANSPORTING GREAT FORCES OCCASIONALLY TO ADD THAT BY

j101009,The Virginia Law Register,1098071,Revision of Our Criminal Laws,i245867,VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER VOL V JANUARY 1900 No 9 REVISION OF OUR CRIMINAL LAWS  Hereafter criminal trials will be upon the merits and the merits aloneARCH BOLD Now that our legislature is in session desiring to do many good things it is proposed in this paper to look somewhat into our criminal laws and see what proportion of evil therein is attributable to bad laws rather than to bad courts We hear a great deal of complaint about the uncertainty of the criminal law and we must admit whether we like to do so or not that there is among our people a prevailing distrust of the certainty of punishing crime Even among the legal profession this same feeling exists We recollect hearing a very able lawyer and judge once say in speaking of a case on trial that with the able counsel engaged the chances were pretty sure that some error would be committed by which a new trial would be secured The pub lic do not hesitate to say that if a prisoner has sufficient counsel and the means to continue litigation from court to court he will probably wear the case out by delay and finally though quietly escape justice Much of this blame is placed upon the courts when in fact no judge however learned can escape the many technical pitfalls that encum ber the way In any case other than the simplest it is nearly al ways possible to raise enough points to have a reversal of the verdict regardless of the merits Our appellate practice is built upon the policy that unless everything appears to be right a new trial shall be granted and many useless things are required to appear and further that if anything has been done however slight which might possibly prejudice the accused a new trial shall be granted whether he was in fact prejudiced or not England from whence came our laws surely had good judges and yet worn out by these intolerable uncertainties and delays finally in 1825 14 and 15 Vict ch 100  swept away the whole mass of little points and legal subtleties and now criminal trials are upon the merits and the merits aloneVIRGFNIA LAW REGISTER Hear how Archbold one of the greatest of English criminal law writers speaks of this reform It is  one of the greatest and best re forms which has ever been made and which is not only calculated to afford great and extraordinary facilities in the administration of crim inal justice but must have a serious and beneficial effect upon the state of crime in the country This technical subtlety was not a healthy or sound state of the criminal law  the offender exulted in his success Nor can nor ought the accused to complain of trial upon the merits If guilty he has no right to be acquitted If innocent his best defence will be upon the merits Why not let us go and do likewise  The English Act is not before us and it would be too long to be in serted but if inserted it would no doubt be a surprise to many The proper way to amend these laws is by the appointment of a commission to revise them This commission to take until the next session of the leg islature to investigate and report Among them should be some county court judges as they are familiar with these laws and no doubt would do the work without charge However we suggest among other things legislative amendments along the following lines GRAND JURIES 1 Section 3977 of the Code should be amended so as to make any qualified voter a competent grand juror There is no good reason why a  road surveyor a constable or the owner of a grist mill should not serve Surely the court could be trusted to select good men These men are already competent to serve on the trial jury where life and death may be involved and yet are forbidden to find the indict ment which they are sitting to try In the writers county there were at one time four or five hundred road surveyors and if any one of these slipped the judicial eye the indictment however serious the charge must be quashed and the commonwealth suffer the costs and chagrin of going over the whole case for a thing that could never have done any injury 2 The impaneling of the grand jury should also be simplified as indicated below 3 The finding of the grand jury recorded by the court should be conclusive that the needful number concurred in the finding 4 Such questions as qualifications of a juror interest in the subject prior opinions substituting another juror and the presence of others in the juryroom should be eliminated 580 JanREVISION OF OUR CRIMINAL LAWS MOTIONS AND DEMURRERS All motions and demurrers should be required to state the exact de fect relied on This would enable the court to correct any injustice at once As it is the prisoner nearly always declines to say what the objection is so as to keep the court in the dark till the trial is over and if he is convicted that he may then get a new trial for a thing which never did him any injustice on the merits and which he delib erately withheld from the court Formal defects should be taken in this manner alone before the jury is sworn with permission to amend 1 Arch 115 THE INDICTMENT 1 Amendments Proper provision should be made to amend the indictment in various particulars as for example to prevent a vari ance in the evidence in matters of description in dates names places amounts unknown persons or means the ownership of property etc Of course reasonable limits should be put upon these amendments For some elucidation of this subject see 1 Arch 15 83 84 86 So as to any statements of value price damage etc So as to certain words and especially technical words as and for or and vice versa feloniously burglariously unlawfully as ap pears by the record maliciously ravish etc Of course it must otherwise appear by the indictment that the offence charged was a felony or other offense in which these technical words are re quired So with amendments as to the venue and jurisdiction 1 Arch 178 On an indictment for a misdemeanor if the proof shows a felony let the jury be discharged and an indictment for felony found and vice versa 1 Arch 175 Our present law and decisions some what cover this last point but not satisfactorily As an illustration of the above can any good reason be given for a mistrial simply because a mans name is stated in the indictment to be  James Smith  when in fact it is John Smith or in the description of a writing that it is for 1043 when it was for 1045 or that a person was killed by strychnine when he was killed by arsenic 2 Indictments in particular offences Many of these need simplify ing as in murder embezzlement the larceny of money offences against the coin malicious injuries and as to accessories before the fact Take our indictment for murder It is  verbose prolix and periphrastic and charges all sorts of things and in all kinds of man ner as for example that J A K late of the county aforesaid 1900 581VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER laborer not having the fear of God before his eyes but being moved and seduced by the instigation of the devil made an assault on one T R and  having a certain pistol of the value of two dollars then and there charged with gunpowder and one leaden bullet which pistol he in his right hand then and there had and held and then and there feloniously willfully deliberately premeditatedly and of his malice aforethought did discharge and shoot off to and against and upon the said T R and that the said J A K with the leaden bullet afore said out of the pistol aforesaid then and there by the force of the gunpowder aforesaid by the said J A K discharged and shot off as aforesaid then and there feloniously as above did strike penetrate and wound the said T R in and upon the back part of the head of him the said T R then and there with the leaden bullet aforesaid so as aforesaid discharged and shot out of the pistol aforesaid by force of the gunpowder aforesaid by the said J A K in and upon the back part of the head of him the said T R one mortal wound of the depth of three inches and of the breadth of half an inch of which said mortal wound he then and there instantly died  There would be no wonder of that And so the jurors aforesaid upon their oaths aforesaid do continue to say on for about three or four pages more And then follows a count for killing by stabbing and an other by striking with a brickbat  and another  with an ax  and finally by some means and in some manner to the jurors aforesaid unknown which is a fit conclusion to such a mixedup affair John sons Forms 442 Now listen to the English indictment as modified by its statute That A B on the  day of   feloniously willfully and of his malice aforethought did kill and murder one C D The means and manner of death are not required 1 Arch 89 So with manslaughter In malicious injuries it matters not whether the malice be toward the owner of the property or otherwise Sec 3887 of the Code should permit accessories before the fact to be indicted as principals especially as sec 3885 punishes them as such 1 Arch 94 Sec 3994 as to embezzlements needs enlarging and clearing up Sec 3995 as to descriptions of writings in forgery should be enlarged as to writings in various other offences and so as to permit the papers to be described by the designation by which it is commonly known The word money should be extended to cover in any offence any coin bank note or treasury note without specifying any particular kind of coin or currency For the sake of 582 Jan1900 REVISION OF OUR CRIMINAL LAWS 583 uniformity the policy already adopted in chap 181 of the Code on Offences against property of deeming these offences larceny should be extendea to all similar cases Thus under our decisions an indictment for larceny would cover all 3 Formal conclusions This is all very well but consider the de luded state to which the legal mind was carried on technicalities when it was solemnly determined above all things that all indictments must conclude against the peace and dignity of the commonwealth or else be quashed and so deluded on technicalities was the legal mind that this requirement had to be put into the constitution A man could constitutionally kill any man in the community and nothing could be done with him unless forsooth he was informed that he had done so against the peace and dignity of the commonwealth THE TRIAL 1 Summoning and empaneling the jury It seems that this ought to be a simple matter If a fair and impartial jury is selected it is all that any one could ask Yet case after case point after point  litigation following litigation has been raised  not on the question of a fair and impartial jury but simply as to how they were summoned and empaneled Sec 3156 should be carefully revised and enlarged making the selection of twelve fair and impartial men the test of any error All questions and they are too numerous to be here repeated as to the venire facias should be eliminated The same remarks apply to summoning the grand jury 2 Selecting the jurors The commonwealth and the prisoner should each be permitted to strike off two from the panel of sixteen in order to get rid of prejudiced or cranky jurors This is just as important to the commonwealth in order to insure a fair trial to it as to the prisoner and would save many a hung jury and the costs of a new trial If the trial court has directed a juror to stand aside because the court was in doubt whether he could give the commonwealth a fair trial and in his place has substituted an unquestioned juror the verdict should stand and not as the Court of Appeals has held be reversed simply because that court was of the opinion that the original juror could also have served It is difficult to see how the Court of Appeals not the present court could ever have arrived at such a conclusion unless it is explained by this deluded state of the legal mind fatally bent on technicalities Suppose the excluded juror was competent and the trial court in error still a good juror was substituted and the originalVIRGINIA LAW REGISTER juror will never again serve on the new trial So the jury de medietate linguce ought to be abolished 3 The record and the presence of the prisoner Of course a prisoner ought always to be present during his trial in a felony case unless perhaps when he voluntarily waives his presence by absconding after the trial has begun In this case the court and jury should be allowed to proceed to verdict The record should show the presence of the accused at the arraignment and on to the judgment except perhaps his presence should not be required in some motions which his counsel can as well make without him But authority should be given the court or the judge in vacation to bring the prisoner into cturt and to amend the record so as to show the fact that the prisoner was actually present If the court can be trusted to make up the record in the first instance it can also be trusted to amend the same in the prisoners presence and subject to any exceptions by him and his counqel Nor is there any goood reason why the record should be required to show the venire or the swearing of the jury on adjournment If these things be not done let them be excepted to but let the record be kept clear of minor details which generally entangle justice Let the record be amended in any particular which accords with the truth of what occurred 4 Separation of the jury No verdict should be set aside because of a separation of the jury unless it is made to appear that injustice resulted from it Suppose one juror is separated and influenced while away He can only hang the jury if for the accused or vote for conviction if against him Is there any sensible possibility much less probability that he or any one else can bribe or influence a whole jury And why not let us deal with these things as they are instead of with imagination 5 Instructions We need a little more good sense on this subject For instance setting aside a verdict because the instructions inadver tently omitted to use the words believe from the evidence Of course they must act from the evidence but is it not really pitiable to think of a jury being misled in the course of a trial by such a thing as this and that too when no objection was raised by the prisoner or his counsel  This subject of instructions cannot be treated of in such an article as this It will have to be considered in somewhat the same manner in which new trials are considered below But it is sufficient to say 584 JanREVISION OF OUR CRIMINAL LAWS that we get our law from the old English common law and the judges who propounded this law and presided at these trials were certainly able and learned men yet if the charges given by these most learned men to the juries who tried their cases and we have as intelligent juries as they were submitted in their statement of the law to be re viewed by our appellate courts nearly every case would be reversed This shows too much subtlety of reason to say the least of it It is said that the English courts administer the laws better than ours and it may be that we find herein the secret of it viz too much refining of the law Like Job we have been darkening counsel by words without knowledge NEW TRIALS Our law grants a new trial wherever anything might possibly have been of injury to the prisoner It matters not whether he was injured or not the law steps in and says that it will conclusively presume that he was injured and will set the verdict aside It is too late for the courts to change this policy But is it sound It seems very well theoretically but practically it produces a great deal of useless annoy ance expense and delay Our times are changed and crimes are in creasing daily We have about 1600 convicts today as against about 300 to 400 some forty year ago It is time to worry a little less over that innocent man for whom the the law has been so solicitous and look a little more after the other ninety and nine Both as to instructions and new trials the appellate courtsshould review the case as on an appeal rather than on a writ of error keep ing always clearly in mind the presumption that twelve men can be trusted to render a sensible verdict and then reviewing all the evi dence affirm the verdict when substantial justice has been done and reversing it when it appears that an injustice has been done This rule would be more just to the accused and commonwealth alike than the present arbitrary rule of looking only at the commonwealths evi dence as is done on a writ of error CALLOWAY BROWN

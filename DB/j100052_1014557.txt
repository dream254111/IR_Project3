J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1014557,ADMINISTRATIVE REORGANIZATION IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT,I242684,ADMINISTRATIVE REORGANIZATION IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BY A N HOLCOMBE PHD PROFESSOR OF GOVERNMENT HARVARD UNIVERSITY EXTRAVAGANCE HAS LONG BEEN A CHRONIC AILMENT OF THE GOVERN MENT OF THE UNITED STATES EVER SINCE JEFFERSONIAN SIMPLICITY GAVE WAY TO THE JACKSONIAN SPOILS SYSTEM IT HAS MANIFESTED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF A CON STITUTIONAL COMPLAINT IN GENERAL IT HAS ENTAILED NO GREAT DRAIN ON THE NATIONAL RESOURCES INDEED DURING THE EIGHTEENEIGHTIES THE POLITICIANS AT WASHINGTON SEEMED MORE DISTURBED BY A SERIES OF RECURRENT SURPLUSES THAN THEY EVER HAD BEEN BY DEFICITS AND PLUNGED INTO AN ORGY OF RIVERANDHARBOR AND PENSION LEGISLATION FAR EXCEEDING ANY PREVIOUS FISCAL DISSIPATIONS IN THE HIS TORY OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PRIOR TO THE WORLD WAR GOVERNMENTAL EX TRAVAGANCE WAS A DISCREDITABLE BUT BY NO MEANS AN INTOLERABLE BURDEN NOW HOWEVER THE NECESSITY FOR ECONOMY IS URGENT AND THE PAINS OF EXTRAVAGANCE ARE ACUTE ADMINISTRATIVE REORGANIZATION IN ANY GOVERNMENT MAY BE ADVOCATED ON TWO GROUNDS ECONOMY AND EFFICIENCY AD MINISTRATIVE REORGANIZATION IN THE FED ERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ADVOCATED ON THE LATTER GROUND FOR MANY YEARS PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT MADE A BEGINNING BY THE APPOINTMENT OF THE KEEP COM MISSION WITH A VIEW TO THE IMPROVE MENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE METHODS IN THE DEPARTMENTS PRESIDENT TAFT WAS DEEPLY INTERESTED IN THE MATTER AND GAVE A GREAT IMPETUS TO THE CAUSE OF ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICIENCY THROUGHOUT THE UNION BY THE CREATION OF THE CLEVE LAND COMMISSION ON ECONOMY AND EFFI CIENCY HOW GREAT THIS IMPETUS WAS IS REVEALED IN THE COMPREHENSIVE STUDY BY THE INSTITUTE FOR GOVERNMENT RE SEARCH ENTITLED ORGANIZED EFFORTS FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF METHODS OF ADMINIS TRATION IN THE UNITED STATES THE EFFI CIENCY MOVEMENT OF THE LAST DECADE HAS ACCOMPLISHED SUBSTANTIAL RESULTS IN THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UNTIL THE CLOSE OF THE WAR COMPARATIVELY LITTLE HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOW THE NEED FOR ECONOMY HAS SUPPLIED A MORE POW ERFUL INCENTIVE FOR ADMINISTRATIVE REOR GANIZATION THAN THE WANT OF EFFICIENCY EVER DIDREORGANIZATION AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 243 DISTRIBUTION OF BUREAUS THE ADVOCATES OF ADMINISTRATIVE RE ORGANIZATION GENERALLY BEGIN WITH A RECLASSIFICATION OF GOVERNMENTAL ACTIV ITIES AND A REDISTRIBUTION OF THE COR RESPONDING ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES BETWEEN THE SEVERAL EXECUTIVE DEPART MENTS IT MUST BE GRANTED AT ONCE THAT THE EXISTING DISTRIBUTION OF THE ADMIN ISTRATIVE BUREAUS BETWEEN THE EXECU TIVE DEPARTMENTS IS UTTERLY ILLOGICAL WE HAVE FOR EXAMPLE A NAVY DEPART MENT WHICH IS CHARGED WITH THE MAIN TENANCE OF EXTENSIVE FACILITIES FOR THE OPERATION OF VESSELS ON THE HIGH SEAS AND THEIR CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR YET FIVE YEARS AGO THE WAR DEPARTMENT HAD A GREATER NUMBER OF VESSELS AFLOAT THAN THE NAVY HAD AND LESSER FLEETS WERE MAINTAINED BY THE TREASURY DE PARTMENT AND THE DEPARTMENT OF COM MERCE THE FORMER OPERATED THE COAST GUARD ORIGINALLY THE REVENUE CUTTER SERVICE WHILE THE LATTER OPERATED TWO FLEETS ONE UNDER THE LIGHTHOUSE SERV ICE ANOTHER UNDER THE COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY NOW THE SHIPPING BOARD HAS A GREATER FLEET THAN ALL THE OTHERS COMBINED MANY OTHER IN STANCES MAYBE CITED OF DIFFERENT DEPART MENTS ENGAGED IN SIMILAR ACTIVITIES LIKEWISE MANY INSTANCES MAY BE CITED WHERE THE SAME ACTIVITY MAY BE CLAIMED ON LOGICAL GROUNDS BY DIFFERENT AGENCIES SHOULD THE AMERICANIZATION OF IMMIGRANTS FOR EXAMPLE BE ASSIGNED TO THE BUREAU OF NATURALIZATION IN THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR ON THE GROUND THAT THE IMMIGRANTS ARE ALIENS OR TO THE BUREAU OF EDUCATION IN THE DE PARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR ON THE GROUND THAT AMERICANIZATION IS AN EDUCATIONAL PROCESS SHOULD CHEMICAL RESEARCHES BE PROSECUTED IN ORDER TO FOSTER THE DEVELOPMENT OF A DOMESTIC DYESTUFFS INDUSTRY BY THE BUREAU OF MINES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR ON THE GROUND THAT THE INTERMEDIATES FROM WHICH THE DYES MUST BE MADE ARE BY PRODUCTS OF THE COAL MINES OR TO THE BUREAU OF STANDARDS OF THE DEPART MENT OF COMMERCE ON THE GROUND THAT THE MANUFACTURE OF COAL TAR DYES IS INTIMATELY CONNECTED WITH THE STAND ARDIZATION OF COLORS OR TO THE TARIFF COMMISSION ON THE GROUND THAT IT IS INTERESTED IN DETERMINING THE NEED FOR PROTECTION OR TO THE BUREAU OF CHEM ISTRY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICUL TURE ON THE GROUND THAT IT HAS A WELL EQUIPPED CHEMICAL LABORATORY AND A STAFF OF SKILLED CHEMISTS SHOULD THE PROTECTION OF THE INTERESTS OF THE GROW ERS OF COTTON OR GRAIN FOR EXPORT BE EN TRUSTED TO THE BUREAU OF MARKETS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE ON THE GROUND THAT IT IS CHARGED WITH THE PROTECTION OF THE INTERESTS OF FARMERS OR TO THE BUREAU OF FOREIGN AND DO MESTIC COMMERCE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE ON THE GROUND THAT IT IS CHARGED WITH THE PROTECTION OF THE IN TERESTS OF EXPORTERS SHOULD THE INVES TIGATION OF THE CONDITIONS OF HEALTH IN RURAL SCHOOLS BE COMMITTED TO THE PUB LIC HEALTH SERVICE OF THE TREASURY DE PARTMENT ON THE GROUND THAT IT IS A QUESTION OF HEALTH OR TO THE BUREAU OF EDUCATION IN THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR ON THE GROUND THAT IS A QUES TION OF EDUCATION OR TO THE STATES RE LATIONS SERVICE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE ON THE GROUND THAT IT IS A MATTER OF COUNTRY LIFE OR TO THE CHILDRENS BUREAU BECAUSE IT IS A QUES TION OF CHILDREN NO ONE OF THESE ALTERNATIVES IS MORE FANTASTIC THAN THE SOLUTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN FOUND FOR OTHER PROBLEMS OF A SIMILAR CHARACTER THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE EIGHTEENTH AMENDMENT WAS AS SIGNED TO THE BUREAU OF INTERNAL REV ENUE BECAUSE THAT BUREAU ALREADY POS SESSED A CORPS OF AGENTS EMPLOYED IN RUNNING DOWN MOONSHINERS AND OTHER VIOLATORS OF THE FEDERAL EXCISE LAWS THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE CHILD LABOR LAW944 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY WAS NEARLY COMMITTED TO THE SAME AGENCY BECAUSE TO AVOID CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS UPON THE LEGISLATIVE AUTHOR ITY OF CONGRESS THE FEDERAL CHILD LABOR LAW WAS ULTIMATELY ENACTED IN THE FORM OF A REVENUE MEASURE THE INSURANCE OF SOLDIERS AND SAILORS AGAINST THE RISK OF DEATH DURING THE WAR WAS ASSIGNED TO THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT BECAUSE THAT DEPARTMENT HAD RECENTLY ESTAB LISHED A WAR RISK INSURANCE BUREAU TO INSURE AMERICAN SHIP OWNERS AND MARINERS AGAINST THE RISKS OF NAVIGATION IN THE FIELD OF BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS WHILE THE UNITED STATES WAS STILL A NEUTRAL COUNTRY ALTHOUGH THE PENSION OFFICE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTE RIOR POSSESSED A LONGESTABLISHED OR GANIZATION FOR MAKING PAYMENTS TO THE VETERANS OF OUR EARLIER WARS AND TO THEIR DEPENDENTS THE PAYMENT OF ALLOTMENTS AND ALLOWANCES TO DEPEND ENTS OF MEN IN THE NATIONAL ARMY WAS ASSIGNED TO THE SAME BUREAU ALTHOUGH THE WAR DEPARTMENT HAD LONG BEEN MAKING SIMILAR PAYMENTS TO DEPEND ENTS OF MEN IN THE REGULAR ARMY THE AWARD OF COMPENSATION TO THE INJURED WAS ALSO ASSIGNED TO THE SAME BUREAU ALTHOUGH THE UNITED STATES EMPLOYES COMPENSATION COMMISSION HAD AL READY BEEN CREATED TO PERFORM A SIMI LAR SERVICE FOR THOSE INJURED IN THE COURSE OF CIVILIAN EMPLOYMENT THE TANGLE OF AUTHORITY BETWEEN THE WAR RISK INSURANCE BUREAU AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE AND FEDERAL BOARD FOR VOCATIONAL EDUCATION OVER THE REHA BILITATION OF THE INJURED IS SUCH A RECENT AND PAINFUL EXPERIENCE THAT THE NEED FOR ADMINISTRATIVE REORGANIZATION IN THAT FIELD NEED NOT BE ARGUED THE CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH AN ILLOGICAL ORGANIZATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES ARE NOT FAR TO SEEK IT LEADS TO CONFLICTS OF AUTHORITY BETWEEN THE HEADS OF COMPETING AGENCIES DUPLICATION OF WORK LACK OF COOIPERATION BETWEEN THOSE IN CHARGE OF RELATED ACTIVITIES AND THE ERRONEOUS ASSIGNMENT OF NEW UNDERTAKINGS IT CHECKS INITIATIVE ON THE PART OF THE LESS FAVORED BUREAU CHIEFS AND ENCOURAGES EXTRAVAGANCE ON THE PART OF THOSE WHO ARE MORE FORTUNATE OR AGGRESSIVE IT IMPEDES THE STANDARDIZATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE METHODS AND PRACTICES CONFUSES THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTS AND RENDERS OB SCURE THE PUBLISHED STATEMENTS OF PUB LIC EXPENDITURES THESE ARE THE PRIN CIPAL ITEMS IN SUPPORT OF THE GENERAL CHARGE THAT THE PRESENT SYSTEM IS NEITHER ECONOMICAL NOR EFFICIENT FORMER ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE NAVY FRANKLIN D ROOSEVELT WHEN A CANDIDATE FOR THE VICEPRESIDENCY DE VOTED MUCH OF HIS ATTENTION ON THE STUMP TO THE NEED FOR ADMINISTRATIVE REORGANIZATION IN THE FEDERAL GOVERN MENT ONE OF HIS FAVORITE ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE ABSURDITY OF PRESENT CONDITIONS WAS THE CASE OF THE BEARS IN ALASKA WHICH ARE UNDER THE PROTECTION OF FOUR DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS WAR INTERIOR AGRICULTURE AND COMMERCE DOUBTLESS HOWEVER THE SAME BEAR IS RARELY EN TITLED TO PROTECTION BY MORE THAN ONE DEPARTMENT AT A TIME AND PROBABLY UNDER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES IT IS MORE CONVENIENT FOR ONE DEPARTMENT TO AF FORD PROTECTION THAN FOR ANOTHER THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE WORK OF PROTECTING BEARS AMONG FOUR DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS IS UTTERLY ILLOGICAL IF THE PRINCIPLE OF CLASSIFICATION UPON WHICH GOVERN MENTAL ACTIVITIES ARE TO BE CLASSIFIED IS THAT OF THE NATURE OF THE SERVICE REN DERED BUT IT MAY NOT BE ILLOGICAL IF A DIFFERENT PRINCIPLE OF CLASSIFICATION BE ADOPTED BEARS MAY BE PROTECTED IN DIFFERENT WAYS SOME METHODS OF PROTECTION MAY BE SUITABLE FOR USE BY THE WAR DEPARTMENT OTHERS BY THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE OTHERS STILL BY THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE OR OF THE INTERIOR IN OTHER WORDS BEFORE THERE CAN BE ANY LOGICAL REDISTRIBUTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES AMONG THEREORGANIZATION AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 245 EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS THERE MUST BE A LOGICAL CLASSIFICATION OF GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES BUT A LOGICAL CLASSIFICATION OF ACTIVITIES IMPLIES AGREEMENT UPON SOME PRINCIPLE OF CLASSIFICATION PRINCIPLES OF CLASSIFICATION THERE ARE SEVERAL POSSIBLE PRINCIPLES OF CLASSIFICATION IN THE FIRST PLACE GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES MAY BE CLASSIFIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CLASS OF PERSONS BENEFITED UPON THIS PRINCIPLE ALL AC TIVITIES DESIGNED TO BENEFIT A PARTICULAR CLASS OF PERSONS WOULD BE PLACED IN CHARGE OF THE SAME ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY THUS ALL ACTIVITIES DESIGNED FOR THE BENEFIT OF CHILDREN WOULD BE ASSIGNED TO A CHILDRENS BUREAU AND ALL THOSE DESIGNED TO BENEFIT WOMEN TO A WOMENS BUREAU IT IS PLAINLY IMPRAC TICABLE TO ASSIGN ALL ACTIVITIES DESIGNED TO BENEFIT MEN TO A MENS BUREAU BUT ACTIVITIES DESIGNED TO BENEFIT FARMERS COULD BE ASSIGNED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE MERCHANTS TO THE DE PARTMENT OF COMMERCE WAGEEARNERS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR ETC THE DIFFICULTY WITH THIS PRINCIPLE OF CLASSIFI CATIONIS THAT THE SAME INDIVIDUALS MAY APPEAR IN SEVERAL CLASSES ACCORDING AS THEY ARE CLASSIFIED ETHNOLOGICALLY BIOLOGICALLY ECONOMICALLY SOCIALLY OR POLITICALLY HOWEVER THE BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS ACCEPTABLY SERVES THE INTERESTS OF INDIANS REGARDLESS OF AGE SEX OCCUPATION OR SOCIAL CONDITION THE BUREAU OF MINES SERVES THE COAL MINING INTERESTS THE BUREAU OF FISH ERIES FISHERMEN THE FOREST SERVICE LUMBERMEN THE BUREAU OF STANDARDS VARIOUS KINDS OF MANUFACTURERS ETC THE ADVANTAGE OF THIS PRINCIPLE OF CLASSIFICATION FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE ADMINISTRATOR IS THAT HE KNOWS TO WHOM HE MUST LOOK FOR SUPPORT AND CAN DEVELOP HIS ACTIVITIES IN THE DIRECTION THAT WILL BRING THE STRONGEST BACKING TO HIS AGENCY THE SUCCESS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE IN SERVING THE INTERESTS OF THE FARMERS AND ITS CORRESPONDING STRENGTH IN CONGRESS HAS ENABLED IT TO EXPAND ITS SERVICES IN MANY WAYS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE HAD THE SAME SERVICES BEEN ENTRUSTED TO AGENCIES OR GANIZED UPON ANY OTHER PRINCIPLE BUT DEPARTMENTS ORGANIZED TO SERVE RELATIVELY WEAKER INTERESTS LIKE THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE FIND IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO SECURE THE AP PROPRIATIONS NEEDED FOR THE DEVELOP MENT OF THEIR ACTIVITIES SECONDLY GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES MAY BE CLASSIFIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NATURE OF THE SERVICE RENDERED UPON THIS PRINCIPLE ALL ACTIVITIES OF THE SAME CHARACTER WOULD BE PLACED IN CHARGE OF THE SAME ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY RE GARDLESS OF THE CLASS OF PERSONS BENE FITED THUS ALL ACTIVITIES RELATING TO EDUCATION WOULD BE ASSIGNED TO A BUREAU OR DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ALL THOSE RELATING TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH TO A PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE WHETHER THE PERSONS BENEFITED WERE FARMERS MER CHANTS WAGEEARNERS CHILDREN IMMI GRANTS INDIANS OR WHAT NOT BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED IN AT TEMPTING TO RECONCILE THIS PRINCIPLE OF CLASSIFICATION WITH THE FIRST THERE HAVE BEEN SOME STRANGE ORGANIZATIONS BROUGHT INTO BEING AT WASHINGTON THE FEDERAL BOARD FOR VOCATIONAL ED UCATION IS THE OUTSTANDING EXAMPLE OF THE RESULTS OF THESE CONFLICTING PRINCI PLES IT IS COMPOSED OF THE SECRETARIES OF AGRICULTURE COMMERCE AND LABOR TOGETHER WITH THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND THREE CITIZENS APPOINTED TO REPRESENT RESPECTIVELY THE FARMERS EMPLOYERS AND WAGEEARNERS EVEN IF NO ATTEMPT IS MADE TO RECONCILE THIS PRINCIPLE WITH THE FIRST IT IS DIFFICULT TO APPLY IT LOGICALLY THE WAR DEPART MENT FOR EXAMPLE WAS CREATED TO PRO VIDE FOR THE COMMON DEFENSE AND HENCE DOES NOT NEED TO CONCERN ITSELF WITH ANY246 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY PARTICULAR CLASS OF PEOPLE BUT IT HAS PROVED VERY DIFFICULT TO DEFINE WITH ANY PRECISION ITS PROPER RANGE OF ACTIVITY ACTUALLY IT MAINTAINS A WELLDEVELOPED HEALTH SERVICE A WELLDEVELOPED EDU CATIONAL SERVICE AND A WELLDEVELOPED ENGINEERING SERVICE TOGETHER WITH A COLONIAL SERVICE THE POST OFFICE DE PARTMENT ALSO MAINTAINS A WIDE VARIETY OF SERVICES WHICH HAVE GROWN OUT OF THE ORIGINAL SERVICE OF TRANSMITTING THE MAILS SUCH AS PARCEL POST POSTAL SAV INGS AND THE TRANSMISSION OF FUNDS THIS PRINCIPLE OF ORGANIZATION IS DEFEC TIVE FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE ADMIN ISTRATOR BECAUSE IT MAKES POLITICAL SUPPORT MORE UNCERTAIN THIS IS EVI DENCED BY THE STUNTED GROWTH OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE AND ESPECIALLY OF THE BUREAU OF EDUCATION THIRDLY GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES MAY BE CLASSIFIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NATURE OF THE PROCESS BY WHICH THEY ARE CARRIED ON THIS LEADS TO WHAT IS OFTEN THOUGH GENERALLY INCORRECTLY CALLED A FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF ADMINIS TRATIVE AGENCIES THE GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE AND THE BUREAU OF EN GRAVING AND PRINTING ARE THE BEST EXAMPLES OF AGENCIES ORGANIZED IN AC CORDANCE WITH THIS PRINCIPLE PROPOS ALS HAVE FREQUENTLY BEEN MADE FOR CARRYING THIS PRINCIPLE FURTHER AS BY COMBINING THE VARIOUS STATISTICAL OFFICES OR CHEMICAL LABORATORIES THAT ABOUND IN WASHINGTON BUT IT CANNOT BE CAR RIED MUCH FURTHER TO COMBINE ALL THE CORPS OF STENOGRAPHERS OR TYPEWRITERS FOR EXAMPLE WOULD BE A MANIFEST AB SURDITY AND THE PROPOSAL TO MERGE ALL THE STATISTICAL OFFICES OR CHEMICAL LABO RATORIES IS HARDLY LESS ABSURD AMONG PENDING PROPOSALS OF THIS CHARACTER THE MOST PROMISING IS THE ONE TO CREATE A DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS WHICH WILL BRING TOGETHER THE VARIOUS ENGINEERING SERVICES NOW SCAT TERED THROUGH SEVERAL DIFFERENT DEPART MENTS THE RECLAMATION SERVICE FOR EXAMPLE WAS ORIGINALLY PLACED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR BECAUSE THE LANDS TO BE RECLAIMED WERE GENERALLY PUBLIC LANDS ALREADY UNDER THE JURIS DICTION OF THAT DEPARTMENT THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC ROADS WAS ORIGINALLY PLACED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE BE CAUSE THE ROADS TO BE IMPROVED BY FEDERAL AID WERE GENERALLY RURAL ROADS WHOSE IMPROVEMENT WAS OF INTEREST PRIMARILY TO FARMERS THE ENGINEER CORPS WAS ORIGINALLY PLACED IN THE WAR DEPARTMENT BECAUSE IT WAS ORGANIZED FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF MILITARY WORKS AND ITS PERSONNEL WAS RECRUITED FROM OFFICERS OF THE ARMY THE SUPERVISING ARCHITECTS OFFICE WAS ORIGINALLY PLACED IN THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT BECAUSE THE BUILDINGS TO BE DESIGNED WERE GEN ERALLY CUSTOMS HOUSES THE FEDERAL POWER COMMISSION CREATED A YEAR AGO WAS PLACED OUTSIDE THE JURISDICTION OF ANY SINGLE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENTS OF WAR THE INTERIOR AND AGRICULTURE WERE TOO JEALOUS OF ONE ANOTHER TO PERMIT ANY ONE OF THEM TO SECURE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OVER THE SUBJECT NO DOUBT THE BRINGING TO GETHER OF ALL THESE AGENCIES UNDER A SINGLE HEAD WOULD FACILITATE CERTAIN ECONOMIES IN THE PURCHASE OF EQUIP MENT AND MATERIALS AND WOULD BE CONDUCIVE TO GREATER EFFICIENCY THROUGH THE STANDARDIZATION OF METHODS AND REGULARIZATION OF WORK BUT WHERE EACH UNIT IS SO WELLDEVELOPED AS TO BE ABLE TO OPERATE UNDER PRESENT CONDITIONS ON A COMPARATIVELY LARGE SCALE IT MAY BE SURMISED THAT THESE ADVANTAGES ARE LIKELY TO BE EXAGGERATED IT IS EVIDENT THAT NO GENERAL REOR GANIZATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES UPON ANY SINGLE PRINCIPLE OF CLASSIFI CATION IS PRACTICABLE EACH OF THE THREE PRINCIPLES MUST BE APPLIED IN THE CASES IN WHICH IT IS ON THE WHOLE THE MOST ELIGIBLE AND SUCH EXPEDIENTS MUST BE ADOPTED AS PROVE MOST SERVICEABLE TO ADJUST THE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST TOREORGANIZATION AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 947 WHICH THE ADOPTION OF CONFLICTING PRINCIPLES IN DIFFERENT CASES WILL INEVI TABLY LEAD CERTAIN EXPEDIENTS HOW EVER ARE CLEARLY BETTER THAN OTHERS MAKESHIFT ARRANGEMENTS AS IN THE CASE OF THE FEDERAL BOARD FOR VOCA TIONAL EDUCATION WILL GENERALLY PROVE UNSATISFACTORY MORE PROMISING ARE THE RESULTS TO BE EXPECTED FROM THE CREATION OF A BUDGET BUREAU AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SOUND PRACTICE WITH RESPECT TO THE PREPARATION OF THE DE PARTMENTAL ESTIMATES A PERMANENT BUDGET BUREAU EQUIPPED WITH AN ADE QUATE INFORMATION SERVICE COULD DO MUCH TO PREVENT THE DUPLICATION OF AC TIVITIES BY DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND TO COORDINATE THE ACTIVITIES OF DIFFERENT AGENCIES EMPLOYING SIMILAR PROCESSES OR RENDERING THE SAME KIND OF SERVICE OR SERVING THE SAME CLASS OF PEOPLE THE FRICTION WHICH IS INEVITABLE IN ANY ADMINISTRATIVE MACHINE ASSEMBLED FROM LOGICALLY INCOMPATIBLE PARTS WOULD BE REDUCED TO A MINIMUM THE ESTAB LISHMENT OF A CENTRALIZED PURCHASING AGENCY OR BUREAU OF SUPPLIES IN PLACE OF THE PRESENT GENERAL SUPPLY COM MITTEE WHICH MERELY ADOPTS STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS AND ARRANGES UNIFORM PRICES FOR SUPPLIES PROCURED BY THE AGENCIES IN WASHINGTON WOULD ALSO IMPROVE PRESENT CONDITIONS SUCH IMPROVEMENTS HOWEVER WOULD NOT REMOVE THE NEED FOR SOME REDIS TRIBUTION OF EXISTING AGENCIES AMONG THE DEPARTMENTS SEVERAL MORE OR LESS COMPREHENSIVE PLANS OF REDISTRIBUTION HAVE BEEN WORKED OUT THE BEST OF THEM IS A PROPOSAL FOR GOVERNMENT RE ORGANIZATION RECENTLY PUBLISHED BY THE NATIONAL BUDGET COMMITTEE ADVANTAGES OF REDISTRIBUTION IN GENERAL THE ECONOMIES RESULTING FROM THE REDISTRIBUTION OF ADMINIS TRATIVE AGENCIES AMONG THE EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS ARE LIKELY TO BE EXAGGER ATED A GLANCE AT THE PUBLISHED STATE MENTS OF APPROPRIATIONS SUGGESTS THAT THE POSSIBLE SAVINGS TO BE OBTAINED BY A MORE ECONOMICAL ARRANGEMENT OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES OUTSIDE THE MILITARY AND NAVAL ESTABLISHMENTS CAN NOT EXCEED A FRACTION OF ONE PER CENT OF THE TOTAL ANNUAL EXPENDITURES GREATER SAVINGS CAN NOT BE OBTAINED EXCEPT BY A REDUCTION IN THE SERVICE RENDERED PUBLIC OPINION PROBABLY WOULD NOT SANCTION ANY FURTHER CURTAILMENT OF THE SERVICES RENDERED TO THE PEOPLE BY THE CIVIL BRANCHES OF THE NATIONAL ADMIN ISTRATION GREATER EFFICIENCY RATHER THAN FURTHER DRASTIC ECONOMIES IS WHAT IS NEEDED A WELLDEVISED PLAN FOR THE REDISTRIBUTION OF CERTAIN BUREAUS WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY DO MUCH TO SECURE AN INCREASE OF EFFICIENCY THE ONLY FIELD FOR ANY SUBSTANTIAL SAVING IS IN THE MILITARY AND NAVAL ESTABLISHMENTS THE EXPENDITURES UPON THE NATIONAL DEFENSE CAN BE GREATLY REDUCED BY A POLICY OF RETREACHMENT IN THE ARMY AND THE NAVY BUT THAT IS NOT A PROBLEM IN ADMINISTRATION IT IS A POLITICAL PROBLEM PROBABLY TOO THE GREATEST ADVAN TAGES TO BE EXPECTED FROM ANY REDIS TRIBUTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES WILL BE POLITICAL RATHER THAN ADMINIS TRATIVE CONSIDER FOR EXAMPLE THE CASE FOR A NEW DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL WEL FARE OR AS IT MIGHT BETTER BE TERMED OF EDUCATION AND SOCIAL WELFARE SUCH A NEW DEPARTMENT WOULD RESULT FROM THE BRINGING TOGETHER UNDER A SINGLE CABINET SECRETARY OF THE BUREAU OF ED UCATION AND OTHER EXISTING EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE THE BUREAU OF WAR RISK INSURANCE THE PENSION OFFICE THE UNITED STATES EM PLOYES COMPENSATION COMMISSION THE CHILDRENS BUREAU THE OFFICE OF INDIAN AFFAIRS ETC ITS ORGANIZATION WOULD GIVE THESE SCATTERED AGENCIES A COMMON HEAD WHO WOULD HAVE NO OTHER RESPONSIBILITY THAN THAT OF PROMOTING THEIR INTERESTS IT WOULD248 THE ANNALS OF THE A1MERICAN ACADEMY GREATLY IMPROVE THEIR POSITION WITH RESPECT TO THE DOMINATING INFLUENCES IN THE GOVERNMENT THE PRESIDENT AND THE CONGRESS IT WOULD BRING THEM LARGER APPROPRIATIONS ENABLE THEM TO EXPAND THEIR SERVICES AND ESTABLISH THEM MORE SECURELY IN THE GOOD OPINION OF THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY THE INDEPENDENT DEPARTMENTS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE REDISTRIBU TION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES WITHIN THE DEPARTMENTS IS THE REORGANIZATION OF THE INDEPENDENT EXECUTIVE ESTABLISH MENTS IN RECENT YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A PRONOUNCED TENDENCY TOWARD THE MULTIPLICATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGEN CIES OUTSIDE THE ORGANIZED EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AT THE CLOSE OF THE ROOSEVELT ADMINISTRATION THERE WERE ONLY THREE SUCH AGENCIES OF NOTE THE COURT OF CLAIMS CREATED IN 1855 THE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION CREATED IN 1883 AND THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION CREATED IN 1887 THE TAFT ADMINISTRATION CREATED SEVERAL SIMILAR AGENCIES NOTABLY THE TARIFF COMMISSION THE COURT OF CUSTOMS APPEALS THE COMMERCE COURT AND THE COMMISSION ON ECONOMY AND EFFI CIENCY THE SUCCEEDING ADMINISTRA TION PURSUED A SIMILAR POLICY DURING PRESIDENT WILSONS FIRST TERM THE FED ERAL RESERVE BOARD THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION THE UNITED STATES SHIP PING BOARD THE EMPLOYES COMPEN SATION COMMISSION AND THE FEDERAL BOARD FOR VOCATIONAL EDUCATION WERE THE MOST NOTEWORTHY ADDITIONS TO THE LIST THE FEDERAL FARM LOAN BOARD NOMINALLY A PART OF THE TREASURY DE PARTMENT IS OPERATED AS INDEPENDENTLY AS THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD THE TARIFF COMMISSION WHICH HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO LAPSE WAS RECREATED ONLY THE COMMERCE COURT WAS DESTROYED DURING THE WAR THE CREATION OF INDE PENDENT EXECUTIVE AGENCIES WAS THE OUTSTANDING FEATURE OF THE ADMINIS TRATIVE POLICY OF THE GOVERNMENT SEVERAL OF THESE INDEPENDENT WAR AGENCIES HAVE SURVIVED NOTABLY THE ALIEN PROPERTY CUSTODIAN AND THE WAR FINANCE CORPORATION THE LATE CONGRESS UNDER REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP CONTINUED THIS POLICY THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION AND THE SHIPPING BOARD WERE ENLARGED AND A NEW RAILROAD LABOR BOARD WAS SUB STITUTED FOR THE UNITED STATES MEDIA TION AND CONCILIATION COMMISSION ORIGINALLY CREATED IN 1913 FURTHER MORE THE FEDERAL POWER COMMISSION NOMINALLY AN INDEPENDENT EXECUTIVE AGENCY CREATED BY THE WATER POWER ACT OF 1920 IS IN SUBSTANCE A SUBCOM MITTEE OF THE CABINET CONSISTING OF THE SECRETARIES OF WAR THE INTERIOR AND AGRICULTURE THE PRINCIPAL PRECEDENTS FOR THIS TYPE OF AGENCY ARE THE COUNCIL OF NATIONAL DEFENSE CREATED IN 1916 CONSISTING OF SIX MEMBERS OF THE CABI NET AND THE INSECTICIDE AND FUNGICIDE BOARD CREATED IN 1910 CONSISTING OF THREE MEMBERS OF THE CABINET IN EACH CASE A SUBORDINATE EXECUTIVE OFFICER IS IN ACTIVE CHARGE OF THE WORK OF THE AGENCY THE ORGANIZATION OF SO MANY INDE PENDENT EXECUTIVE ESTABLISHMENTS TENDS TO PRODUCE A CONDITION OF ADMINISTRA TIVE DISINTEGRATION LIKE THAT WHICH EXISTED GENERALLY IN THE STATES A FEW YEARS AGO NEW YORK FOR EXAMPLE POSSESSED OVER ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEPARATE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES AND SEVERAL STATES POSSESSED OVER A HUNDRED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS NOT YET APPROACHED SUCH A CONDITION OF ADMIN ISTRATIVE DISINTEGRATION AS EXISTED IN THESE STATES BUT IT IS LAUNCHED UPON A COURSE WHICH LEADS IN THAT DIRECTION IN THE LARGER STATES THE PROCESS OF AD MINISTRATIVE REORGANIZATION IN RECENT YEARS HAS BROUGHT THESE INDEPENDENT AGENCIES TOGETHER MORE OR LESS EFFEC TIVELY WITHIN A COMPARATIVELY FEW EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS ADMINISTRAREORGANIZATION AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 949 TIVE REORGANIZATION IN THE FEDERAL GOV ERNMENT HOWEVER HAS BEEN GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD HITHERTO AS THE REDISTRIBU TION OF EXISTING BUREAUS AMONG THE DEPARTMENTS AND HAS NOT COMPRE HENDED THE INCLUSION OF INDEPENDENT ESTABLISHMENTS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENTAL SCHEME OF ORGANIZATION PRESIDENT TAFT WAS DEEPLY INTERESTED IN THE PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNMENTAL AD MINISTRATION AND DISPLAYED A MORE PRO FOUND INSIGHT THAN MANY ADMINISTRA TIVE REFORMERS HIS POLICY SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN FOUNDED UPON A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THREE TYPES OF ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION THAT WHICH IS QUASILEGISLATIVE IN CHARACTER THAT WHICH IS PURELY EXEC UTIVE AND THAT WHICH IS QUASIJUDICIAL THE FIRST TYPE WAS REPRESENTED BY THE TARIFF COMMISSION WHOSE TASK IT WAS TO ASCERTAIN THE FACTS WHICH SHOULD BE THE BASIS OF WISE LEGISLATIVE ACTION THE SECOND TYPE WAS REPRESENTED BY THE COMMISSION ON ECONOMY AND EFFICIENCY WHOSE TASK IT WAS TO IM PROVE THE METHODS OF ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION AS IS WELL KNOWN PRESIDENT TAFT WAS WORKING TOWARDS THE CREATION OF PERMANENT AGENCIES BY MEANS OF WHICH THERE COULD BE EFFECTIVE CENTRAL CONTROL OF PURELY EXECUTIVE ACTION THE THIRD TYPE WAS REPRESENTED BY THE COURT OF CUSTOMS APPEALS AND THE COMMERCE COURT WHOSE WORK AS THE NAMES INDICATE WAS INTENDED TO BE ASSIMILATED TO THAT OF THE ORDINARY COURTS OF JUSTICE IN CONSTITUTING AN AGENCY OF THE FIRST TYPE THEREFORE THE TAFT PLAN CONTEM PLATED THE DELIBERATE REPRESENTATION OF THE MAJOR POLITICAL PARTIES THE TARIFF COMMISSION WAS ACTUALLY SO ORGANIZED AS TO GIVE THE DOMINANT PARTY A MAJOR ITY AGENCIES OF THE SECOND TYPE WERE NOT DESIGNED TO BE EITHER BIPARTISAN OR NONPARTISAN THEY WERE TO BE AGENTS OF THE PRESIDENT SUBJECT TO HIS DIRECTION AND CONTROL AGENCIES OF THE THIRD TYPE WERE INTENDED TO BE NON PARTISAN HENCE THEIR MEMBERS WERE TO RECEIVE THE RANK AND TENURE OF JUDGES UNFORTUNATELY PRESIDENT TAFTS MOST AMBITIOUS VENTURE IN THE FIELD OF ADMINISTRATIVE REORGANIZATION THE COMMERCE COURT FAILED TO FULFIL HIS EX PECTATIONS AND PARTLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF AN UNWISE APPOINTMENT FELL A VICTIM TO ADVERSE POLITICAL CONDITIONS PRESIDENT WILSON SHOWED BY HIS CON DUCT OF THE WAR ESPECIALLY BY HIS HAND LING OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEMS GROWING OUT OF THE CONTROL OF FOOD FUEL AND THE WAR INDUSTRIES AN APPRECIA TION OF SOUND PRINCIPLES OF ADMINIS TRATION BUT HE DID NOT SEEM DISPOSED TO ACT UPON THOSE PRINCIPLES DURING HIS FIRST TERM HE SANCTIONED THE DESTRUC TION OF THE COMMERCE COURT AND THE CREATION OF POWERFUL ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES SUCH AS THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION AND SHIPPING BOARD WITHOUT REGARD TO THE PRINCIPLES TO WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY HE SCRUPULOUSLY ADHERED IN THE ORGAN IZATION OF THE FOOD AND FUEL ADMIN ISTRATIONS AND THE WAR INDUSTRIES BOARD THE MOST POWERFUL IN FACT IF NOT IN LAW OF THE SPECIAL WAR AGENCIES PERHAPS THE EXPLANATION MAY BE FOUND IN THE FACT THAT HE ENJOYED PRACTICALLY A FREE HAND IN THE ORGANIZATION OF THOSE WAR AGENCIES DESPITE THE STRONG FIGHT MADE IN CONGRESS IN BEHALF OF THE COMMISSION PLAN FOR FOOD AND FUEL CONTROL WHILE HE WAS CONSTRAINED TO ACCOMMODATE HIMSELF TO CERTAIN DEMO CRATIC PRECONCEPTIONS IN MATTERS OF ADMINISTRATION WHEN PUSHING THROUGH CONGRESS THE FEDERAL RESERVE FEDERAL TRADE AND SHIPPING ACTS BE THAT AS IT MAY THE AGENCIES CHARGED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF THOSE GREAT STATUTES ARE ENDOWED WITH A COMBINATION OF POWERS WITHOUT A PARALLEL IN THE HISTORY OF THE NATIONAL ADMINISTRATION WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION DURING THE PERIOD 19061910 AND SINCE250 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY 1913 THEY MAY INVESTIGATE ASCERTAIN FACTS DETERMINE POLICIES INSTITUTE PROS ECUTIONS TRY THE ACCUSED IMPOSE JUDG MENT AND EXECUTE THEIR DECISIONS MOREOVER THEY HAVE BEEN DELIBER ATELY ORGANIZED UPON PARTISAN LINES THE PRINCIPLE UPON WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN CONSTITUTED IS THAT ADOPTED BY THE TAFT ADMINISTRATION FOR QUASI LEGISLATIVE AGENCIES SUCH AS THE TARIFF COMMISSION WHICH DEALS WITH MATTERS OF PUBLIC POLICY WHEREIN PARTISANSHIP FINDS ITS PROPER PLACE THE PRINCIPLE APPROPRIATE FOR AN AGENCY EXERCISING QUASIJUDICIAL FUNCTIONS EXEMPLIFIED IN THE ILLSTARRED COMMERCE COURT HAS BEEN LOST FROM VIEW THESE BOARDS EXERCISE QUASILEGISLATIVE POWERS TO BE SURE MOST CONSPICUOUSLY IN THE CASE OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMIS SION WITH ITS CAMPAIGN FOR REGULATION OF THE PACKING INDUSTRY BUT THEIR QUASIJUDICIAL FUNCTIONS ARE TOO IMPOR TANT TO BE SO LIGHTLY DISREGARDED THIS IS NOT THE REIGN OF LAW AS THAT TERM WAS FORMERLY UNDERSTOOD IT IS THE REIGN OF MEN EXERCISING WHAT COMES DANGER OUSLY NEAR TO ARBITRARY POWERS OVER THEIR FELLOW MEN IN SOME OF THEIR MOST VITAL ACTIVITIES CHARLES E HUGHES SPEAKING ON THIS SUBJECT LAST YEAR AT THE CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION OF THE HARVARD LAW SCHOOL ASSOCIATION WAS REPORTED TO HAVE SAID DISREGARDING THE LESSONS OF HISTORY THERE HAS BEEN A DISPOSITION TO REVERT TO THE METHODS OF TYRANNY IN ORDER TO MEET THE PROBLEMS OF DEMOCRACY INTENT ON SOME IMMEDIATE EXIGENCY AND WITH SLIGHT CON SIDERATION OF LARGER ISSUES WE CREATE AUTO CRATIC POWER BY GIVING ADMINISTRATIVE OFFI CIALS WHO CAN THREATEN INDICTMENT THE OPPORTUNITIES OF CRIMINAL STATUTES WITHOUT ANY APPROPRIATE DEFINITION OF CRIME IGNORING THE DISTINCTIONS PRIZED BY THE FATHERS AND EXCUSING THE VIOLATION OF TRADITION BY EASILY MADE PHRASES WE UNITE LEGISLATIVE EXECUTIVE AND JUDICIAL POWERS IN AN ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY WITH LARGE SPHERES OF UNCONTROLLED DISCRETION WHICH MAY INVESTIGATE AND LAY COMPLAINT AND THEN TRY AND DETERMINE FACTS UPON WHICH THE COMPLAINT RESTS THEIR FINDINGS OF FACT WHERE THERE IS ANY DISPUTE IN THE EVIDENCE BEING MADE FOR MANY PURPOSES CONCLUSIVE USEFUL AS ARE THESE INSTRUMENTALITIES OF ADMINISTRATION THEY REPRESENT TO A STRIKING DEGREE A PREVALENT DESIRE TO DO WITHOUT LAW THERE IS THUS RECOURSE TO THE MOST PRIMITIVE METHOD IN DEALING WITH THE MOST DIFFICULT PROBLEMS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY IN REORGANIZING THE INTERSTATE COM MERCE COMMISSION AND THE SHIPPING BOARD BY THE TRANSPORTATION AND MER CHANT MARINE ACTS OF 1920 THE LATE CONGRESS SHOWED NO APPRECIATION OF THE DANGERS TO WHICH THE PRESENT SECRETARY OF STATE HAS SO FORCEFULLY DIRECTED OUR ATTENTION BY THE NEW CONSTITUTION OF THE SHIPPING BOARD FOR EXAMPLE ITS MEMBERS ARE ALL TO BE PARTISANS FOUR FROM ONE AND THREE FROM THE OTHER OF THE TWO MAJOR PARTIES THEIR TERMS ARE FAIRLY LONG AND EXPIRE IN SERIES BUT THEY MUST BE SO CHOSEN AS TO REPRESENT THE VARIOUS SHIPPING INTERESTS OF THE COUNTRY THIS IS PROPER IN THE CASE OF A BOARD WITH QUASILEGISLATIVE POWERS BUT WHOLLY IMPROPER IN THAT OF ONE WITH IMPORTANT QUASIJUDICIAL POWERS THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION HAS ALWAYS FUNCTIONED AS A QUASILEGISLATIVE RATHER THAN A QUASIJUDICIAL BODY THOUGH ITS POWERS OF THE LATTER DESCRIP TION ARE OF HIGH IMPORTANCE THE IN TERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION IS APPARENTLY DESTINED TO FUNCTION IN A SIMILAR MANNER THE PRESENT ADMIN ISTRATION HAS A BETTER TRADITION SO FAR AS THESE MATTERS ARE CONCERNED BE QUEATHED TO IT BY THE TAFT ADMINIS TRATION ITS MEMBERS CAN NOT PLEAD IGNORANCE OF THE PRINCIPLES OF SOUND ADMINISTRATION IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT WHEN IT DEALS WITH THE TASK OF ADMIN ISTRATIVE REORGANIZATION IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT WILL NOT FAIL TO ACT UPON THE WISDOM WHICH IT POSSESSES251 CERTAIN OF THE INDEPENDENT ESTABLISH MENTS SHOULD BE INCORPORATED INTO EXISTING OR NEW DEPARTMENTS OTHERS MUST REMAIN WHOLLY OR IN PART OUTSIDE THE FRAMEWORK OF DEPARTMENTAL OR GANIZATION BUT WHERE NECESSARY SHOULD BE RESOLVED INTO THEIR SEVERAL ELEMENTS QUASILEGISLATIVE FUNCTIONS SHOULD BE ASSIGNED TO AGENCIES ORGANIZED FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF SUCH FUNCTIONS QUASI JUDICIAL FUNCTIONS SHOULD BE ASSIGNED TO AGENCIES ORGANIZED FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF SUCH FUNCTIONS THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION FOR EXAMPLE AND THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION PERFORM CERTAIN DUTIES WHICH MIGHT NOT IMPROPERLY BE TRANSFERRED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE OTHERS MAY BE VESTED IN ANY SUITABLE PARTISAN OR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY THE PURELY EXECUTIVE DUTIES OF THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION ALONE WOULD FURNISH AMPLE EMPLOYMENT FOR A LARGE BUREAU IN THE DEPARTMENT OF COM MERCE STILL OTHER DUTIES OUGHT TO BE TRANSFERRED TO AGENCIES WHOSE NON PARTISANSHIP CAN NEVER FAIL TO BE ABOVE SUSPICION THESE CHANGES IN ADMINISTRATIVE OR GANIZATION WOULD PROBABLY SAVE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LITTLE IF ANY MONEY ON THE OTHER HAND THEY WOULD CERTAINLY IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE SERVICES CONCERNED BUT MOST IMPOR TANT OF ALL THEY WOULD GREATLY STRENGTHEN THE GOVERNMENT IN THE CON FIDENCE OF THE PEOPLE FOR THE MOMENT PUBLIC OPINION SEEMS DISPOSED TO MAKE FEWER DEMANDS UPON THE GOVERNMENT FOR THE INCREASE OF ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIV ITIES THAN FOR A LONG TIME PAST THE OPPORTUNITY SHOULD BE SEIZED TO INTRO DUCE SOUND METHODS OF ADMINISTRATION TO STRENGTHEN THE ADMINISTRATIVE MA CHINERY AND TO ACCUMULATE A STOCK OF PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE CAPACITY OF THE GOVERNMENT WHICH WILL STAND IT IN GOOD STEAD WHEN OPINION PRESENTLY DEMANDS THE ASSUMPTION OF NEW RESPONSIBILITIES TOWARDS THE PUB LIC AND HEAVIER BURDENS AGAIN FALL UPON OUR ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM

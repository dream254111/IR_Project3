OBSERVATIONS ON RED CORAL IN A LET TER TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY FROM MR ANTHONY VAN LEEUWENHOEK F R S THIS BRINGS YOU PURSUANT TO YOUR OWN REQUEST SOME OBSERVATIONS WHICH I MADE ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO CONCERNING RED CORAL WHICH ARE THESE THAT FOL LOW IN A LETTER OF MINE OF THE 29TH OF DECEMBER 1705 I ACQUAINTED YOU HOW I HAD FOUND SOME SMALL PARTS OF BLOODCORRAL UPON A LITTLE SCOLLOP SHELL AND UPON A PIECE OF A LITTLE HORN OR SMALL FISH SO CALLED AND THAT I WAS OF OPINION THAT THAT CORRAL DID NOT GROW BUT WAS ONLY COAGULATED UPON THE SAID SHELLS I HAD FORMERLY SEVERAL TIMES SLIT BOTH IN LENGTH AND THICKNESS PIECES OF BLOODCORRALTHAT WERE VERY FAIR AND OF A SHINING REDNESS AND CUT OFF AS THIN SCALEY PARTI CLES AS TWAS POSSIBLE FOR ME TO DO TO THE END THAT I MIGHT DISCOVER THE VESSELS IN THE SAME IN DOING WHICH I FANCYD TO MY SELF THAT NOW AND THEN I COUD PERCEIVE SOME VERY SMALL ORIFICES OF THE SAID VESSELS BUT THEY WERE SO EXCEEDING SMALL THAT I COUD MAKE NO PERFECT REMARKS OF THEM THO I COULD EASILY OBSERVE THAT IN THOSE PARTS THAT I HAD CUT THRO ACROSS THERE RAN SUCH FIBRES FROM THE CENTRE TO THE CIRCUMFERENCE AS ARE FOUND IN THE ROOTS OF UNDERGROUND FRUITS AND NOT WITHSTANDING ALL MY ENDEAVOURS I COND NOT FIND ANY PORES IN THEM AT LEAST SO AS TO SAY ANY THING CERTAIN OF THEM BUT IT SEEMD TO ME AS IF MOST PARTS OF THE COR RAL WERE MADE UP OF ROUNDISH PARTICLES SUCH AS SOME CERTAIN127 CERTAIN FRUITS ARE COMPOSD OF BUT THEIR ROUNDNESS WAS SUCH THAT EACH OF THEM WERE IN A MANNER OF A DIFFERENT FIGURE SUCH AS MIGHT BEST SUIT WITH ALL THE REST AND SO AS TO LEAVE NO VACUITY IN THEM AND THUS THE SAPS WHICH ARE NOT IN THE VESSELS ARE CONVEYED FROM ONE OF THOSE ROUND PARTS TO THE OTHER AND SO SERVE FOR CHA NALS I COULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT THAT THE PARTS OF RED CORRAL WERE SO CLOSELY UNITED TO ANOTHER AS I HAVE SINCE DISCOVERD I KNOW INDEED THAT THERE ARE PIECES OF BLOODCORRAL PRESERVED AS RARITIES IN A GREAT MANY CLO SETS THAT ARE LIKE LITTLE TREES WITH THEIR BRANCHES FAST NED TO STONES OR OTHER SUBSTANCES AND PRETENDED TO BE MIRACULOUSLY GROWING OUT OF THE SAME BUT ONE IS NOT OBLIGED TO BELIEVE IT UNLESS IT COUD BE PROVED THAT SUCH CORRALS HAD ROOTS AND LITTLE FIBRES PROCEEDING FROM THEM WHICH IF THEY DID NOT PENETRATE INTO THE STONE MUST AT LEAST BE SO SPREAD OVER THE SURFACE OF IT AS TO BE OBVIOUS TO THE SIGHT I WILL RATHER SUPPOSE THAT CORRAL WHILST IT IS GROW ING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA IS VERY SOFT AND THAT THOSE PLANTS OF CORRAL OR THE BRANCHES THEREOF BEING BROKEN OFF BY THE CORRAL FISHERS THE THICK ENDS OF THEM MAY ACCIDENTALLY FALL UPON A STONE OR SOME OTHER SUBSTANCE AND BY REASON OF THE AFORESAID SOFTNESS AND OF A GLUTINOUS MATTER WITH WHICH IT IS ENDUED MIGHT VERY EASILY BE FASTENED TO THE STONE AND AFTERWARDS PEO PLE MADE TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS A WONDERFUL EXCRESCENCE FROM SUCH STONES OR OTHER SUBSTANCES I HAVE TWO PIECES OF CORRAL BY ME THAT WERE NO BIGGER THAN A HENS QUILL I BROKE ONE OF THEM INTO SEVERAL PARTS AND FOUND IN THREE PLACES CAVITIES THAT TOOK UP MORE THAN HALF THE SPACE OF THE CORRAL IT SELF BETWEEN THESE CAVITIES THE PARTS OF THE CORRAL WERE SO LID AND CLOSE IN EACH OF THOSE CAVITIES THERE WAS A THIN MEMBRANCE THAT ONE WOUD JUDGE TO BE A BIT OF A DRYD128 DRYD LEAF BECAUSE THE LONG PARTS THAT APPEARED IN THEM IN GREAT NUMBERS SEEMD TO BE CANALS OR VESSELS BUT UPON A STRICT EXAMINATION INTO THE SAME I JUDGED THEM TO BE COAGULATED SALT PARTICLES AND THE RATHER BECAUSE THEY WERE SHARP AT BOTH ENDS NOW I MUST CONFESS IT IS UNCONCEIVABLE TO ME HOW SUCH PARTICLES SHOUD BE FOUND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COR RAL ESPECIALLY IF WE ALLOW THAT SUBSTANCE TO RECEIVE ITS NOURISHMENT AND INCREASE AFTER THE SAME MANNER AS OTHER PLANTS FOR MY FURTHER SATISFACTION I TOOK A LITTLE PIECE OF VERY FINE RED SHINING CORRAL AND PUT IT INTO THE FIRE AND OBSERVED THAT A LITTLE HEAT CAUSED THE FINE REDNESS TO VANISH AND TURND IT INTO AN ASHCOLOUR THE CORRAL BEING IN THIS CONDITION THE SUPERFICIES OF IT STILL RETAINS THE SAME SMOOTHNESS BUT UNDER IT THE PAR TICLES SEEMD LIKE RIBS EXTENDED LENGTHWAYS IN THE COR RAL AND VIEWING THE SAME MORE NARROWLY I OBSERVED THAT THE SAID RIBLIKE PARTICLES COMPOSED A CIRCLE OF ROUND SCALES AND THAT SEVERAL ROUNDNESSES WERE MADE BY THOSE RIBLIKE PARTICLES TILL THE MIDDLE POINT OF THE CORRAL IN WHICH THERE WAS NO OPENING BECAME A LONG SINGLE PARTICLE NOW HAVING OBSERVED THAT THE CORRAL BY BEING HEAT ED DID NOT BURST IN PIECES BUT WAS ONLY SPLIT OR RENT IN ONE PLACE I IMAGINED THAT THE MATTER WHICH WAS DRI VEN OUT OF THE CORRAL BY THE HEAT OF THE FIRE EVAPO RATED THRO THAT RENT THAT WAS MADE IN THE CORRAL OR ELSE THAT THE PARTS OF THE CORRAL BEING OPEND BY THE HEAT THE MOISTURE THAT WAS IN THE INTERNAL PARTS MIGHT BE DRAWN UP TOWARDS THE EXTERNAL AFTER THIS I TOOK A LITTLE PIECE OF CORRAL AND PUT IT IN TO A GLASS AND PUT THAT INTO THE FIRE ENCREASING THE DEGREES OF HEAT SO FAST TILL THE GLASS WAS MELTED BUT I PRESERVED THE MATTER THAT WAS DRAWN OFF AS WELL AS I COULD AND VIEWING IT THRO A MICROSCOPE I DISCOVERD A129 A WATERISH MOISTURE WHICH TO THE NAKED EYE SEEMD YELLOWISH AND WHICH WAS MINGLED WITH AN EXCEEDING NUMBER OF SMALL PARTICLES WHICH MADE THE LIQUOR THICK AND TROUBLED AND TWAS ALSO MINGLED WITH A YEL LOWISH OYL WHICH WHERE IT LAY THICKEST WAS OF A RED DISH COLOUR I TOOK MOREOVER SOME OTHER PIECES OF CORRAL AND LAID THEM UPON GLOWING WOODCOALS AND PUT THEM INTO SO GREAT A HEAT THAT THE COLOUR TURND FROM RED TO A FINE WHITENESS AND IN THAT CONDITION I THREW IT INTO SOME CLEAR RAIN WATER AND OBSERVED THAT THE PARTS THEREOF WERE IMMEDIATELY SEPARATED AND THE MOST PART OF IT IN APPEARANCE TURND INTO A WHITE AND CHALKY SUB STANCE AND THE REASON WHY ALL THE REST OF THE CORRAL WAS NOT DISSOLVED WAS IN MY OPINION BECAUSE A SUFFI CIENT HEAT COUD NOT REACH THE PARTS OF IT FOR WHEN I TOOK THE REMAINDER AND HEATED IT AS I HAD DONE BEFORE THE SAME EFFECT WAS PRODUCED IN THAT LIKEWISE THE WATER IN WHICH THE CORRAL WAS QUENCHED HAD NOT STOOD A MINUTE BUT THAT I COUD PERCEIVE A SCUM OR MEMBRANCE OF SALT PARTICLES WITH WHICH IT HAD BEEN IMPREGNATED UPON THE SURFACE OF IT AND WHICH CONSISTED OF SUCH AN UNSPEAKABLE NUMBER OF SMALL SALTS JOYND TO ONE ANOTHER THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DISCOVER THE FI GURE OF THEM AFTER THE WATER HAD STOOD SOME HOURS I DISCOVERD ABUNDANCE OF SALT PARTICLES AND OF SO MANY SEVERAL FI GURES THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE THEM SOME OF THEM WERE AS CLEAR AS CHRYSTAL AND IT WAS A VERY PLEA SING SPECTACLE TO SEE SO MANY SEVERAL FIGURES OF SUCH DIF FERENT SHAPES AND SIZES LYING TOGETHER IN SUCH A NARROW COMPASS AND AS FINE AND SHINING AS THEY WERE WHEN SUR ROUNDED WITH WATER NO LESS DARK WERE THEY ALMOST ALL OF THEM WHEN THE WATER WAS EVAPORATED AND THEN IT APPEARD AS IF THEY WERE DISSOLVED INTO A GREAT MANY SMALL PARTICLES SEEMING TO BE OF A WHITISH SUBSTANCE T AT130 AT ANOTHER TIME I FANCYD THAT I SAW THE WATERY PART WHICH LAY UPON OR ABOUT THOSE SALT PARTICLESIMPREGNATED WITH ABUNDANCE OF OTHERS MUCH MORE SMALL THAN THE FORMER WHICH IN THE EVAPORATING OF THE WATER WERE COAGULATED UPON THE FIRST MENTIONRD CLEAR SALTS AND SO ECLIPSED THE SHINING OR GLAZINESS OF THOSE SALTS AFTER SOME DAYS HAVING DECANTED THE WATER OFF THE WHITISH MATTER AND POURED FRESH UPON IT I OB SERVED THAT THERE WERE SALT PARTICLES STILL COAGULATING UPON THE SUPERFICIES OF THE WATER AND THOSE SALT PAR TICLES WERE EXTRACTED FROM THE CORRAL IN SO UNSPEAKA BLE A NUMBER THAT NO BODY WOUD BELIEVE IT UNLESS HE HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF IT FROM HENCE WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT THE HARDNESS OF THE CORRAL PROCEEDS FROM NO OTHER CAUSE BUT THE GREAT NUMBER OF ITS FIXD SALTS NOW FORASMUCH AS THE HEAT OF THE FIRE WAS SUFFICIENT TO TAKE AWAY THE REDNESS OF THE CORRAL AS SOON AS IT WAS PUT INTO IT I LAID THREE LITTLE PIECES OF CORRAL ON AQUA FORTIS TO TRY WHETHER THAT WOUD HAVE THE SAME EFFECT AND I HAD NO SOONER POURED THE AQUA FORTIS UPON THE CORRAL BUT THE AIR BUBBLES WHICH CAME OUT OF THE SAID CORRAL TOOK UP FOUR TIMES THE SPACE THE AQUA FORTIS HAD FILLED BEFORE AND THE CORRAL MOREOVER BY REASON OF THE GREAT MULTITUDE OF AIR BUBBLES THAT CONTINUALLY CAME OUT OF IT SOME OF WHICH ALSO STUCK UPON IT WAS RAISED FROM THE BOTTOM TO THE SUPERFICIES OF THE WATER BUT THE SAID WATER WAS NOT IN THE LEAST TINGED WITH THE RED CORRAL BUT IT BECAME WHITISH WHICH WAS OCEASI OND BY ALL THOSE PARTS SEPARATED FROM THE CORRAL AND WHEN THE AQUA FORTIS HAD NO MORE POWER TO DISSOLVE THE CORRAL BY REASON THAT I HAD POURED BUT A VERY LITTLE UP ON IT THE AFOREMENTIOND DISSOLVED PARTS SUBSIDED TO THE BOTTOM AND THE SUPERFICIES OF THE AQUA FORTIS RESUMED ITS FIRST CLEARNESS AFTER131 AFTER THE AQUA FORTIS HAD STOOD ABOUT TWO HOURS UP ON THE RED CORRAL I TOOK A LITTLE OF THAT WHITISH MAT TER THAT HAD SUNK TO THE BOTTOM OF THE GLASS AND PUT TING IT UPON A CLEAN GLASS PLATE I DISCOVERD AN UNSPEAK ABLE NUMBER OF LONG PARTICLES THAT SEEMD JUST LIKE THE VERY FINE HAIR OF ONES BEARD AFTER IT HAD BEEN SHAVED OFF TWO OR THREE DAYS I TOOK ALSO SOME OF THE UPPER PART OF THE AQUA FORTIS THAT WAS CLEAR AND POURING IT UPON A CLEAN GLASS I LIKEWISE DISCOVERD THEREIN A GREAT MANY LONG PARTICLES SUCH AS ARE MENTIOND BEFORE AND WHEN I EXAMINED MORE STRICT LY INTO THAT WHITE MATTER THAT HAD SUBSIDED TO THE BOT TOM OF THE GLASS I FOUND THAT TWAS NOTHING ELSE THAN THE SLENDER PARTICLES ABOVEMENTIONED SOME OF WHICH WERE LONGER THAN THE REST THE AQUA FORTIS HAVING NOT BEEN SUFFICIENT TO DISSOLVE ALL THE CORRAL I ADDED A LITTLE MORE TO IT AND THEN OB SERVED THAT IN A SHORT TIME THE REMAINING PART OF THE CORRAL WAS NOT DISSOLVED SAVING THAT A VERY FEW PARTS WHICH WERE COMPOSED OF MUCH SMALLER OR RATHER THOSE SMALLER WERE AGAIN COAGULATED FLOATED UPON THE TOP OF THE WATER BUT TWAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DISCOVER OF WHAT FI GURE THEY WERE AND THEN THE AQUAFORTIS WHICH HAD BEEN IMPREGNATED WITH THE RED CORRAL WAS VERY CLEAR BUT WHEN I CAME TO VIEW IT THRO A MICROSCOPE I DISCO VERD THAT THERE WERE STILL AN UNSPEAKABLE NUMBER OF THE AFORESAID LONG PARTICLES FLOATING THEREIN I PLACED THE SAID VERY SMALL PARTICLES BEFORE A GLASS WHICH MAGNIFIED MUCH MORE THAN THAT I HAD ALREADY U SED AND THEN I DISCOVERED SUCH EXCEEDING SLENDER PARTI CLES AS DID ALMOST ESCAPE MY SIGHT AND WHICH I SUP POSE WERE ALTOGETHER INVISIBLE BEFORE WITH THIS GLASS I DISCOVERD LONG PARTICLES WHICH DID NOT ONLY EXCEED THE REST IN LENGTH BUT IN THICKNESS TOO AND THE ENDS OF WHICH WERE BLUNT AND HAVING DISCO VERD IN SOME FEW OF THEM THREE DISTINCT SIDES I CON T 2 CLUDED132 CLUDED THAT THEY WERE OF AN HEXANGULAR FIGURE AND CONSEQUENTLY THAT THEY WERE SALTPETER PARTICLES FROM THESE OBSERVATIONS I CONSIDERD WITH MY SELF WHETHER ALL THOSE SALT PARTICLES IN WHICH I SAID BEFORE I HAD DISCOVERD SO MANY DIFFERENT FIGURES WERE NOT ORIGINALLY OF THE SAME SHAPE WITH THOSE VERY SLENDER SALT PARTICLES THAT I DISCOVERD WHEN I DISSOLVED THE COR RAL IN THE AQUA FORTIS NOTWITHSTANDING THEY WERE A THOU SAND TIMES SMALLER THAN THEY APPEARED THRO THE MICRO SCOPE AND THE DIFFERENCE OF THEIR FIGURES MAY PERHAPS BE ONLY OCCASIOND BY THE ACCESSION OR COAGULATION OF OTHER PARTICLES WHICH IN ONE PLACE MAY BE GREATER OR LESS THAN IN ANOTHER AND ACCORDINGLY THE FIGURE AND SIZE OF THEM ARE DETERMINED BY THEIR NEARNESS OR DISTANCE FROM ONE ANOTHER AFTER THIS I BROKE OFF TWO LITTLE PIECES OF RED CORRAL FROM A SMALL SHELL I HAD LYING BY ME AND WHICH IS DE SCRIBED IN A PRECEDING LETTER BY FIG 4 LETTER A AND PLACED THAT LIKEWISE UPON A PIECE OF WOODCOAL WHICH I MADE RED HOT BY BLOWING ON IT THE FLAME OF A WAX CANDLE AND IN THAT CONDITION THREW IT INTO A LITTLE CLEAN RAINWATER AND PRESENTLY OBSERVED THE CORRAL TO BE DISSOLVED INTO A FINE WHITE MATTER AND SOON AFTER THE MATTER OVERSPREAD WITH A SCUM WHICH FROM TIME TO TIME ENCREASED IN THICKNESS AND ABOUT TWO HOURS AFTER AMONGST THE INFINITE NUMBER OF EXCEEDING SMALL SALT PARTICLES I SAW SOME OF A LARGER SIZE COAGULATED AGREE ING WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED SALT PARTICLES IN SHORT ONE WOUD IMAGINE THAT THE SALT PARTICLES THAT WERE SEPA RATED FROM THAT LITTLE PIECE OF CORRAL AND WHICH WERE COAGULATED IN AND UPON THE WATER DID ALTOGETHER MAKE A GREATER BODY THAN EVEN ALL THE PARTS OF THE CORRAL IT SELF WOULD AMOUNT TO NOW HAVING BEEN INFORMED THAT A CERTAIN PHYSICIAN OR SURGEON ESTEEMED BY SOME PERSONS BUT OF SMALL RE PUTE WITH OTHERS WHO HAVE SKILL IN PHYSICK DID MAKE USE133 USE OF CORRAL IN HIS MEDICINES AND BEING MY SELF OF OPINION THAT CORRAL CAN BE OF NO MANNER OF SERVICE TO THE BODIES OF MEN I TOOK SOME OF THE FINEST RED COR RAL THAT ONE SHALL SEE AND PUT IT INTO POST PAPER AND BEAT IT WITH A HAMMER UPON AN ANVIL TO POWDER AFTER THAT I PUT THE SAME POWDER INTO A CLEAN GLASS AND POURED UPON IT FAIR RAINWATER TILL THE PARTICLES OF THE CORRAL WERE COVERD WITH WATER THEN I HEATED THE SAID WATER SO MUCH THAT I CAUSED IT TO BOIL ABOUT A MINUTE AND PUT A LITTLE OF THIS WATER AFTER IT HAD STOOD SOME TIME AND WAS GROWN COLD UPON FOUR SEVERAL PLACES AND UPON THE CLEANEST GLASSES I COUD GET TO THE END THAT THE WA TER MIGHT FOR THE MOST PART OR RATHER ALTOGETHER EVA PORATE AND THAT I MIGHT BY THIS MEANS DISCOVER WHE THER ANY OF THE SALT PARTICLES WERE GONE OVER TO THE WA TER FOR IN CASE NONE OF THE SALT PARTICLES SHOUD GO OVER TO THE WATER HOW CAN ANY ONE SUPPOSE THAT CORRAL HAS ANY INFLUENCE UPON OUR BODIES IN RESPECT TO OUR HEALTH AFTER THAT THIS WATER WAS INTIRELY EVAPORATED I VIEW ED IT CAREFULLY BUT COUD DISCOVER NOTHING REMARKABLE IN IT AND WHEN I HAD ALSO CAUSED THE CLEAN RAINWATER TO EVAPORATE I COUD NOT BUT THINK THAT THERE WAS NO OTHER DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT AND THE OTHER WATER IN WHICH THE POWDERD CORRAL WAS BOILED THAN THAT THERE WERE MORE PARTICLES IN THE RAINWATER THAN IN THAT WHICH WAS BOILED I ALSO VIEWED THE WATER IN THE BOTTOM OF WHICH THE BOILED CORRAL LAY SEVERAL TIMES WITH MY NAKED EYE SO LONG TILL THE WATER WAS IN A MANNER EVAPORATED BUT I COUD NOT IN THE LEAST DISCOVER ANY SALT PARTICLES IN IT AND THE WATER MOREOVER REMAINED VERY CLEAR IN SHORT I CONCLUDE THAT TIS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THOSE FIXD SALTS OF WHICH CORRAL IS FOR THE MOST PART COMPOSED CAN POSSIBLY BE DISSOLVED IN THE BODY BUT ONLY BY SHARP SALTS OR BY FIRE AND CONSEQUENTLY THAT IT IS ALTO GETHER134 GETHER AN UNPROFITABLE THING IN PHYSICK AND WHO KNOWS WHETHER THEY THAT CRY UP CORRAL SO MUCH DID EVER MAKE ANY USE OF IT UNLESS IT WERE TO AMUSE COMMON PEOPLE WITH UNCOMMON MEDICINES AND THEREBY GET THEMSELVES A NAME WHILST THEY ARE IN THE MEAN TIME ONLY CHEATING THE WORLD OF WHICH WE HAVE SO MANY EXAMPLES I HAVE LIKEWISE EXAMINED INTO TWO OTHER SORTS OF WHITE CORRAL AND NOTED SOME FEW REMARKS UPON THEM BUT I SHALL NOT TROUBLE YOU WITH MORE AT PRESENT BUT CONCLUDE AND REMAIN TOURS C

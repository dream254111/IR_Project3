interpretion of all the facts now disclosed forces upon us Each successive season a fresh series of analyses and practical tests were made and put upon record beginning with that stage of the development of the plant when the percentage of cane sugar had previously been supposed to have reached its maximum and extending them through the after period of juiceripening brought on by the timely separation of the immature grain up to the time of frost It was found that the saccharine strength of the juice under the new conditions constantly increased in a fixed ratio and that the life of the plant was pro longed from a month to two months beyond the natural period To be continued THE ASTRONOMICAL EXHIBITS AT THE WORLDS FAIR THE Astronomical Exhibits at the Worlds Fair at Chi cago represent fairly well the present state of the science of astronomy But they are scattered about in the vari ous buildings so as to make it difficult even to find them all to say nothing of systematic study and comparison of them one with another In a general way the most important astronomical displays are to be found among the educational exhibits which are located in the west and south galleries of the Manufactures and Liberal Arts Building In the exhibit of Harvard University in the south gallery is a splendid collection of astronomical photographs made by the Harvard College Observatory Especially interesting are several photographs of stellar spectra and of nebule and clusters One photograph of a portion of the moons disk represents an enlargement of over one thousand diameters Nowhere else can be found a better illustration of the great usefulness of photog raphy in astronomy The collections of Draper and Langley are to be found in the exhibits of the University of the City of New York and of the Western University of Pennsylvania The fourinch almacantar which is the first one constructed and used by Dr Chandler is in the exhibit of De Pauw University The exhibit of Johns Hopkins University contains a fine collection of diffrac tion gratings and photographs of spectra by Professor Rowland In the German Educational Exhibit in the west gallery are specimens of the famous Jena optical glass the original spectroscope of Kirchhoff and some fine mathematical models by Brill Here is also shown the magnetic apparatus of Gauss and Weber Near by in the English Exhibit is the display of the Royal Astro nomical Society containing a large number of astronom ical photographs by Roberts Gill and Abney and still others from the Royal Observatory at Greenwich Boed dickers drawings of the Milkyway and Dr Commons fivefoot glass speculum are in the English exhibit The latter is unsilvered and has evidently been placed with greater care to secure safety than visibility In the Swiss Exhibit in the main aisle of the Manufactures Build ing is a display of instruments by La Societe Genevoise The exhibits of the American makers of astronomical instruments are in the north gallery of the Manufactures Building just over the main aisle Warner and Swasey show a fine twelveinch equatorial telescope with smaller instruments and also the mounting of the great fortyinch Yerkes telescope which is set up at the north end of the main aisle The appearance of the great telescope gives an impression of symmetry and strength The lens for it is being made by Alvan Clark  Sons of Cambridgeport Mass They report satisfactory progress but say that it 45 will not be finished for a year or more The Clarks by the way make no exhibit at Chicago J A Brashear of Allegheny Pa exhibits the stellar spectroscope for the Yerkes telescope He also shows an eighteeninch and a fifteeninch objective gratings specula etc G N Saeg muller of Washington exhibits a variety of instruments of precision among which are a nineinch equatorial tele scope and a fourinch steel meridian circle The exhibit of the Gundlach Optical Company also deserves mention The American instrumentmakers as a whole make a most creditable showing The displays of the foreign instrumentmakers are many of them located in the Elec tricity Building Schott und Genossen of Jena show a large number of specimens of optical glass and among them are two twentythreeinch discs of the celebrated Jenaglass Merz of Munich shows two equatorial tele scopes and several telescopic objectives the largest of which is ten inches in diameter The Repsolds of Ham burg seem not to be representeda fact much to be re gretted Dr Gills interesting stellar photographs are in the Cape Colony Exhibit in the Agricultural Building and the Lick Observatory display is in the educational depart ment of the California State Building and is strangely enough mixed up with the kindergarten exhibit there The U S Naval Observatory Exhibit is a small observ atory located northeast of the Government Plaza and is in charge of Lieut A G Winterhalter U S N There are a small equatorial telescope photoheliograph and many smaller instruments The Weather Bureau Exhibit a short distance to the west is well worth a visit The exhibit of Coast Survey apparatus in the U S Govern ment Building is full of interest from the geodetic stand point SCIENCE TEACHING IN SECONDARY AND PRI MARY SCHOOLS DR GEO G GROFF LEWISBURG PA IT has long been a dream of scientists that the time would come when the elements of natural history and of the physical sciences would be taught in secondary and primary schools To thinking people it does not seem necessary to argue that every boy should be instructed in the elements of chemistry natural philosophy botany geology zoology and physiology To persons not teach ers it would seem no difficult matter to find a place in the school curriculum for the elements of the above sciences But it remains true that they are not taught or taught to such an extent and in such a manner as to produce results entirely worthless Why is this condition of things prevalent  Why after all that has been said and written is there is no change for the better The answer seems to be this The ele ments of the sciences are not taught in elementary and primary schools for the reason that the teachers them selves have never been taught and without instruction they feel that to attempt to teach these branches they would be blind leaders of the blind More than this the schools whose special duty it is to train teachers for primary and secondary schools have not begun to do any real work in the line of science instruction The sciences in these schools are so placed in the background that practically no training at all is given in them It is then no wonder that the graduate of such a school does not feel capable of giving any instruction in even the elements of the sciences To demonstrate the above statements the catalogues of the Pennsylvania State normal schools will be examined and certain results tabulated It will be seen that the teachers of arithmetic and grammar far September 15 I893

defendant bank with which they kept deposits for check The plaintiffs drew certain checks on the bank which were altered in amount by the payee and the bank in good faith paid the amount as it appeared after the alteration The plaintiffs drew the checks negligently so that blank spaces were left in front of the words and figures representing the amounts of the checks The Negotiable Instruments Law of Kentucky provides that the bona fide holder of negotiable paper which has been altered may enforce payment according to the original tenor The plaintiffs brought an action against the bank to recover for the wrongful payments Held the plaintiffs are entitled to recover the difference between the amounts of the checks as raised and the amounts of the checks as orig inally drawn Commercial Bank v Arden  Fraley Ky 197 S W 951 See NoTEs p 276 REAL PROPERTYEASEMENTSSCOPE OF GRANTThe grantee of a right of way crossed a stream in the line of the easement by means of a ford for twentyone years In times of high water it was very diffi cult and occasionally impossible to ford the stream for a period of several days Subsequently the grantee built a bridge over the stream which caused the water to overflow the plaintiffs premises during a period of high water An action was brought against the grantee for damages Held the grantee is not liable Hammond v Hammond Pa 101 Atl 855 It is a well established principle that the conveyance of an easement gives the grantee all such rights as are incidental or necessary to the reasonable and proper enjoyment of the easement Hathorn v Stinson 10 Me 224 25 Am Dec 228 Maxwell v McAtee 9 B Mon Ky 20 48 Am Dec 409 See MINOR REAL PROP  100 JONES EASEMENTS  816 There are cases where alterations to property have been allowed which were necessary to enable the grantee to enjoy a reasonable use of his easement Hutchins v Lazery 78 Misc Rep 518 139 N Y Supp 957 The test laid down to determine the right to make a particular alteration is whether or not it is of such a nature as to result in the creation and substitution of a different servitude from the one which originally existed Thus an easement to carry water in an open ditch cannot be altered by placing a pipe line in the ground in lieu thereof Allen v San Jose Land  Water Co 92 Cal 138 28 Pac 215 15 L R A 93 But the substitution of a oneinch pipe in place of a onehalfnch pipe will not be enjoined where no more water was used after the change than before Hutchius v Lavery supra It is settled that no material change can be made in the easement although the result wculd prove beneficial to both parties Allen v San Jose Land  Water Co supira But the mere lapse of time in failing to exercise a right which is in cident to the reasonable and proper enjoyment of an easement does not have the effect of abandoning the right Thus a railroad was con 291292 VIRGINIA LAW REVIEt structed over a right of way sixty years after the grant of the easement in order that the purpose of the easement might be more fully carried out David v Kingscote 6 M  W 173 In the instant case the fact that the grantee has used the right of way for more than twenty years without a bridge was a strong indication that the erection of a bridge was not reasonably necessary to the enjoyment and use of the ease ment But the fact that in times of high water the stream was practi cally impassable for several days at a tinie would seem to rebut the above presumption STATUTESCONSTRUCTION OF TAXATION STATUTEALIMONY AS CON STITUTING INCOMEA decree granting a divorce a mnensa et thoro to a husband and wife ordered the husband to pay the wife 3000 per month as alimony It wzs sought to tax such alimony under the federal in come tax law Held alimony is not income Gould v Gould 38 Sup Ct 53 The federal act concerning the taxation of incomes provides in part that the net income of a taxable person shall include gains profits and incomes derived from salaries wages    or gains profits and income derived from any source whatever including the income from but not the value of property acquired by gift bequest devise or descent Thus it will be seen that the real question to be deter mined is whether alimony is income within the meaning of the statute In the construction of statutes levying taxes it is a well settled rule that the provisions of such statutes are not to be extended beyond the clear import of the language used but in case of doubt they are to be construed most strongly against the government and in favor of the taxpayer Amnerican Net and Tzcine Co v Worthington 141 U S 468 Benziger v U S 192 U S 38 Alimony seems to occupy a unique place in the law Its sole object is the provision of necessaries for the support of the wife after the mar riage bonds have been severed Romaine v Chatuncey 129 N Y 566 26 Am St Rep 544 14 L R A 712 It differs materially from a debt and is rather a portion of the husbands estate to which the wife is equitably entitled or it may be regarded as a portion of the husbands current income or earnings Audubon v Shufeldt 181 U S 575 Not only is it not a debt from the husband to the wife but it cannot be subjected to the payment of the debts of the wife due third persons before the allowance of the alimony Romaine v Chauncey supra Hence the allowance of alimony has no effect upon debts existing be tween the husband and wife prior to divorce Scott v Scott 83 Conn 634 78 Atl 314 And imprisonment for contempt of court for refusing to pay alimony is not imprisonment for debt Barclay v Barclay 184 Ill 375 51 L R A 331 It has been held that the award of alimony is based on the ground of public policy and that it cannot be diverted from the purpose of sup port without public injury Fickcl v Granger 83 Ohio St 101 93 N E 527 32 L R A N S 270 Although it seems inequitable that one receiving such a large sum of money for her support as the wife in the

FINANCES OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION THE story of the assignats used as money and affording the chief financial resource of the French Republic during the years from 1792 to I796 is well known The account is given in all general works upon the French Revolution and has been the special subject of a great number of treatises To go over the ground once more however and mark the successive phases of the biggest experiment with paper money ever tried is a task not devoid of interest the experience of the past is the lesson of the future INTRODUCTORY During the second half of the reign of Louis XV and under Louis XVI the finances of the kingdom became demoralized as Necker pointed out in his report there had been a deficit every year Calonne during his ministry owned to a deficit in 1787 of one hundred and twentyfive million francs Among other works which may be consulted are Les Finances de la France sous la Revolution by E LEVASSEUR published in the reports of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences i866 and I867 the Procds Verbaux of the Assemblee Nationale Constituante the Assemblee Legislative the Convention Nationale and the Conseil des Anciens Les Finanzces de la Ripublique Francaise en lan IX by RAMEL L Histoire de la Revolution Franzcaise by THIERS Les Finances de lAncien Regimse et de la Revolution by RENE STOURAI the article  Budget by BOILEAU in the Dictionaire des Finances 179I8O JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY The impossibility of making both ends meet in the public finan ces led to the convocation of the StatesGeneral in I787 The King called this body together to carry out a financial reform the StatesGeneral resolved itself into the Constituent Assembly and began a revolution by the overthrow of feudal rights and privileges of all sorts and by declaring the double principle equality and liberty in civil matters sovereignty of the nation in the political order This legal revolution took form in a great number of special laws and in the Constitution of 1791 A reform of the imposts and the payment of the old govern ment debts and of the debts contracted during the reform itself followed in the course of this revolution The new taxes how ever could not immediately fill an empty treasury and owing to the fear inspired in owners of capital by the Revolution Necker on entering upon his second ministry could not obtain the loans which he had made use of at the outset Prior to the Revolution the clergy as a body held landed property of great extent This body had now lost all its privi leges and so ceased to exist and its properties were declared to be forfeited to the state accordingly on the 2d November I 789 the Constituent Assembly issued a decree to the effect that  all ecclesiastical properties are at the disposition of the Nation to be used as may seem best to defray the expenses of reli gion These lands were added to the crown lands already declared public property The government thus became the holder of real property valued at not less than from two to three milliards of livres a colossal sum at that period on the other hand it had a great debt to pay and therefore publicists thought that it would be just and at the same time easy to use the one for paying off the other II THE CREATION OF ASSIGNATS BY THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY Accordingly on the igth December the Assembly so altered a proposal offered by Minister Neckera proposal to use the proceeds of sales of the public lands to reimburse the CaisseTHE A SSIGNA TS I 8I dEscompte for advances made by it as to authorize the govern ment to offer for sale ecclesiastical property to the value of 400 million francs and to issue immediately assignats of a denomina tion of IOOO livres bearing interest at five per cent These assig nats when paid out by the Treasury to its creditors were expected to be partly turned in immediately in payment for land purchased partly redeemed in specie out of a fund realized from sales of land according to these two hypotheses assignats issued would be retired from circulation through the sale of land and cancelled as fast as they were redeemed The whole fundamental idea of the theory of the assignats was embodied in these two suppositions No scheme for the sale of lands however was adopted and so no lands were sold Many deputies in the Assembly looked with chagrin upon the alienation of ecclesiastical properties The municipality of Paris in its enthusiasm for the Revolution felt no such sentiment and offered to buy en bloc 200 millions of these estates to be paid for in obligations maturing at different times within five years What resource is left to us   said Thournet the issue of assignats and that alone But no one wishes to succeed imme diately to the possessions of the church The only way to give value to your assignats is to sell them in large quantities To whom  To municipalities who can sell to individual buyers This reasoning won the approval of the Assembly which at once 17th March 1790 determined that properties worth 400 millions should be immediately sold and given over to the municipality of Paris and to other municipalities of the kingdom and that the municipalities should be bound to put the said properties on sale whenever a purchaser presented himself and offered to pay the price assessed by experts But munici I PITION de VILLENEUVE says of this proposal  Have we not the power to create a representative currency according to our needs  Have we not ourselves the power to impose throughout the empire the necessary confidence  We have at our disposal the ecclesiastical funds and lands  Let us create sight obligations let these bear inter est let us guarantee redemption Can the Caisse dEscompte offer such security for its paper  Thuis let us pay to real creditors the interest which would have been paid to a bank Speech by P6tion le Villeneuve ioth December I789I82 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY pal paper could not become a national currency the deficit for the year has been estimated at 300 million exclusive of I70 million loaned the Treasury by the Caisse dEscompte whose notes were at that time legal tender in Paris The discussion began again although the deputies occupy ing the Right protested against the creation of a paper cur rency both because they held paper money to be dangerous in itself and because in this instance it was to be secured by sale of the public domain On the 17th April I790 the Assembly decided that the state should issue assignats which should be legal tender between all persons in all parts of the kingdom and bear interest at three per cent 1 Has gold a more real value than property to be sold  a more real value than paper secured by that property  asked Petion If acceptance of assignats is voluntary cupidity will threaten them with a con siderable depreciation As legal tender they will be distrib uted in many hands and so will find defenders The benefit to be derived from assignats will be a stable circulation a rise of prices by increasing the number of buyers a revival of com merce and manufactures Assignats began to circulate They at once declined by five per cent early in September the four hundred millions voted by the Assembly had been exhausted because taxes the Treas urys ordinary source of revenue no longer yielded any income Yet the Assembly hoped to be able to discharge the payable debt which some estimated to be i300000000 and others over iSoooooooo livres3 Hence renewed debates in the Constituent IAt first promises to pay assigniats later August I0 I70o assignats in denomina tiOnls of I000 300 and 200 livres 2 Accordinig to a report by Montesquiou the deficit for ordinary expenditures in I790 appears to have been about 350000000 3 This payable debt I300000000

from arrears of the Treasuryarrears in rentes of I788 being paid in I790 a delay of two years The permanent debt life and other annuities amounting altogether to about two and and onehalf milliards did not figure as a portion of the debt immediately payable detle exigileTHE ASSIGNA TS I83 Assembly during September This was the most serious of all their discussions the great battle which ran through eight ses sions and finally was settled less upon economic than upon political considerations Those who opposed paper money held it to be a form of credit which could be kept at par with specie only so long as it could be unquestionably and immediately exchanged for coin that the mortgaging of real property does not make redemption either sure or easy that the holder of an assignat is not necessarily and generally cannot be a purchaser of land that no one could foresee the degree of depreciation which would follow before the paper was absorbed by the sale of the lands nor the consequent rise in prices nor the loss to creditors Mirabeau who first brought up the question won over a majority of the votes by his powerful eloquence To fear said he that the national properties will not sell is a crime against the country It is the belief that the sale of the national properties will be certain and immediate which alone can assure success to our project for liquidation by means of assignats since there is no other resource than such a sale for the salvation of the state   We have sworn to achieve and to enforce our constitution which means that we have sworn to employ the proper means to that end that we have sworn to stand by the decrees dealing with the public properties to persevere to the end and hasten the execution of those decrees an oath of loyalty is included in the oath we have taken there is no true citizen no good Frenchman who is not bound to give his support here If only the public lands are sold if only they are taken up freely throughout the country France is saved  Our assignats are a new creation and correspond to no old term and we shall be no less inconsistent in applying to our assignats ideas commonly associated with paper money than our fathers were unwise in esteeming Laws paper money of equal value with gold and silver The metals of which money is made up are employed only in the secondary arts while the property upon which the assignats are based is the fundamentalI84 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY source of all production I ask then all philosophers all econo mists all nations of the earth Is there not more real value more true wealth in the material represented by our assignats than in the material adopted to serve as money  Here is the place to expound that maxim of finance so hackneyed and so inadequately expounded paper it is said drives out specie Very well then let us have specie and we shall not ask for paper Assignats have not caused scarcity of coin scarcity already existed they have lessened its effects Create a greater quan tity of assignats issue small notes and there will no longer be a scarcity Have no fear of an excess Industry needs money I can hear Americans saying to the French During our Revolution we created an unsound paper currency yet that paper saved us without it our Revolution had been impossible And you who have also a revolution to carry through you who along with great needs possess great resources you who have still more domains at your disposal than you have assignats secured by those domains you who in creating a sound paper currency do not create a debt but discharge one you will not hesitate to commit yourselves to this measure You who have commenced your career like men will not finish it like children  On the 29th September I790 the decree was passed which authorized an issue of assignats to the amount of i200 millions including the 400000000 already authorized  noninterest bearing money An explanatory decree of the i 3th December declares that as the notes are payable to the bearer they should not be endorsed From this time on France had a paper cur rency Nothing was wanting there was forced circulation absence of interest circulation from hand to hand an enormous issue which was more than half the entire currency of France as estimated some years before by Necker who had not been minister since the 3d September By the end of the year I 790 Deputy Anson chairman of the Committee on Finance announced that the exchange of the old crown properties for bank notes had been effected and that already they had burned the first million of assignats paid intoTHE ASSIGNA TS I85 the Treasury By the first of next month he added  no nation in Europe will be prompter in its payments than the French nation Fond hopesnever to be realized III IMMEDIATE EFFECTS Why throw into circulation in this way more than a thousand million livres of fictitious money Might not the interest on claims already due have been paid and the principal have been funded for gradual payment at a quieter period  and would it not have been wiser to have used paper money to defray necessary running expenses alone  What a delusion to believe that paper issued in such quantities couid be kept at par with gold and silver It is at the beginning at the moment when a govern ment has still to make its choice of means that it is of import ance to have a clear insight into principles and an ability to foresee results in matters of finance Once entered on the wrong path a government can seldom turn back it is more difficult to stop half way down the hill than to avoid starting The Constituent Assembly either would not or could not look ahead political interests prevented their seeing the economic results These results began to work out at once and in the years which followed manifested themselves in fatal succession as it were and with cumulative force Paper drives out silver it had been said That was what happened A scarcity of gold and silver set in and by Septem ber 1791 at the time the Constituent Assembly yielded its authority to the Legislative Assembly the assignat had depre ciated I8 or 20 per cent As there were no notes of a lower denomination than 5o livres no subsidiary money existed Paris and more than half the provincial cities and market towns and private larties even issued promissory notes which during I79I circulated every where but caused much annoyance The Constituent Assembly took the matter in hand and by a decree of the 6th May I79Ii86 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY ordered an issue of I00 millions in assignats of low denornina tions and i5 millions in copper sous Some exchange bureaus were set up these were not easy of access confusion ensued and gave a new impulse to speculation In September the Assembly anxious to facilitate the payment of wages of labor ers authorized the Commissaries of the Treasury to open an office at Paris where manufacturers might have a chance to exchange assignats of high denominations for fivelivre notes By June the I200 millions had been nearly all paid out in liquidations and payments on the debt and for running expenses and it became necessary to authorize a further issue of 6oo millions IV THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY The Legislative Assembly found itself still more completely destitute of resources than the Constituent Assembly had been It issued assignats in denominations as low as ten sous and although it remained in session but one year it increased the cir culation by a succession of new issues to two milliards2 The account presented by Montesquiou toward the end of the session of the Con stituent Assembly Ist August 1790the figures of which were disputed in the Assemblymade the following statement Livres Assignats authorized I7th April29th September I790 i9thJune I791 I800000000 Interest coupons on the first issue of assignats  I656468 I80 I656468 Of this sum there had already been expended  I283273333 Leaving  5I8383I35 Assignats returned into the Treasury of which 215000000 had been cancelled  22I23I831 It appears therefore that there were in circulation  I062038502 2The Assembly understood by a circulation of two milliards an actual circulation to that amount in other words that the government might in addition to the new issues of assignats reissue assignats returned to the Treasury so long as the total amount of assignats outstanding should not exceed two milliards At this time how ever expenses amounted to about eighty millions a month receipts from customs from sales of public property etc to about thirty millions The thirty millions were expended and an additional issue of fifty millions made necessary But what part did the col lateralsecurity theory play in these reissues  and the theory of absorption of the assignats by sale of the lands THE A SSIGNA4 TS I87 Accounts at the Treasury were not kept with any more accu racy during this year than they had been under the Convention and no one knew exactly what was the amount of the receipts and of the expenditures But it may be stated that the Legislative Assembly paid out in one year more than a thousand millions for ordinary expenses of the civil service for discharge of the payable debt and for carrying on the war It is to be added that the assignats which had depreciated by about i8 per cent at the time the Assembly came into power had depreciated by 44 per cent at the time the Assembly gave place to the Convention therefore the coin value of the sum expended by the Assembly was about three fourths of a milliard V THE NATIONAL CONVENTION The Convention proclaimed the Republic But from the first day the Convention found itself confronted with an empty treas ury with taxes which remained for the most part unpaid and with an administration not so organized as to be able to enforce collec tion with the liquidation of the affairs of the old regime still unachieved with a foreign war requiring the active service of five armies and presently a civil war Absorbed in its own internal dissensions it had no time to think of putting financial affairs in order it did however take important and praiseworthy action for the unification of the various obligations of the gov ernment by creating the Grandlivre a list of the creditors of the State It lived upon the only resource at hand a resource left it by previous assembliesthe assignat But the Convention was wrong in trying to identify the issue of assignats with the Revolution itself and to enforce it with the Terror as it sought to enforce civism Hence injustice and acts of violence I It appears from a statement made by Cambon in the National Assembly that from the ist of January to the 22d of September I792 there was turned into the Treasury 9iioooooo livres in assignats and of this amount there was then remaining in the Treasury but 56oooooo The taxes for I792 had not at that time been collectedI88 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONVOJIY At the suggestion of Cambon a forced loan of one milliard from rich citizens was decreed Prairial May I793 upon the condition that the certificates of this loan should be used only in the purchase of public lands This was an injustice it scarcely affected the circulation inasmuch as but a small portion of the loan could be collected Assignats bearing the royal stamp that is to say those issued before the declaration of the Republic fell in value a little less than the rest  the speculators were distrustful This distrust so irritated the Convention that without in any way securing holders against loss it demonetized the 558 millions of royal assignats still remaining in the hands of the public2 of higher denominations than IOO livres on the pretext that only aristocrats could hold assignats of high denom inations The currency was thus relieved to the extent of half a milliard but only at the cost of a disgraceful repudiation The opening of the Grandlivre although an excellent measure in other respects did not attract many assignats for conversion into rentes3 On 22nd September I792 the date of the declaration of the Republic the total assignats issued amounted to 2589 millions the total retired to 6i7 millions there remained in circulation I972 millions On i ith Brumaire of the year IV 2nd November 1795 the day following the close of the Convention the total issue aggregated 23 milliards and there remained in circulation 195 milliards These are the figures given by Ramel4 They are perhaps too low A report to the Conseil des Anciens states that in November I795 the total assignats printed amounted 29430 Eight or ten per cent less 2There had been I440000000 issued but about 9oooooooo had been received back 3Cambon who reported the project estimated the total assignats outstanding in August I793 at 32I7000000 he estimated that of this sum one milliard would be absorbed by the forced loan that one milliard would be subscribed for rentes in the Grandlivre and that one milliard would remain in circulation as money 4 Table given in Ramels work Les Finances de Za Republic Francaise en lan IX Ramel was Minister of Finance in the year IVTHE ASSIGN4A TS I89 millions of which five milliards were still in the treasury and I9 in circulation The remainder had been cancelled This immense issue of at least I85 milliards nominal value an average for three years of more than six milliards a year began in a series of war measures authorizing issues based upon the assertion of those introducing the measures that the pledge of the public domain which grew constantly through the confis cation of the properties of the emzgres more than covered the debt created by the issue Later to facilitate matters issues were made simply at the discretion of the Committees of Finance and of Public Safety To the mass of assignats issued by the government must be added a mass of counterfeit assignats thrown into circulation the product of a shameless brigandage which added to the discredit of the paper It is not surprising that such an excessive supply resulted in a lowering of the value of the assignat and an inflation of prices Although the law decreed the penalty of six months imprisonment for the first offence of twenty years imprisonment for the second ist August I793 and afterward 20th Florealioth May I794 of death for the tendering or receiving of assignats at less than their face value still the assignats declined by 6o or 70 per cent during the first half of the year I 794 It is clear that the Terror violated all economic laws By December I 794 at the close of the Reign of Terror the assignat had lost 8o per cent of its original value At the close of the Convention an assignat of I00 livres exchanged on the Bourse for 2 livres i sou 3 deniers in coin a depreciation of 98 per cent2 The Convention tried to stop the rise in prices of goods by fixing a maximum Schedules were prepared covering all articles and affixing the prices of I 790 increased by onethird to  It happened one day that the Army of the North seized at Ostend a chest contain ing 2270000 livres in assignats which had been sent from Germany to the Paymaster General Napoleon afterward adopted the idea and issued counterfeit notes in Germany 2 According to Ramel As compared with gold the depreciation was still greater for the louis dor 24 livres was worth 2500 livres in assignatsI90 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMIY which was added a further increase of five per cent for wholesale and of ten per cent for retail trade the penalty of death was decreed against any merchant charging higher than schedule prices But at this point the Reign of Terror failed in great part for it was unable to habituate the business world to parting with a hundred livres worth of goods for Ioo livres in paper nmoney which would exchange for less than 6o livres in coin The attempt to enforce the law only increased fraud discouraged honest trade and brought on a dearth because owners hid their wares At Paris it became necessary to deal out rations to the people Each inhabitant presenting a ticket issued by the communebon was entitled to two ounces of bread and a measure of rice every day but each one must fetch his own portion applicants formed in lines before the doors of butchers and bakers shops they sometimes passed whole nights in waiting and when the bread gave out before all had received their portion the crowd broke out in imprecations After the fall of Robespierre and with him the Reign of Terror it became impossible to retain the law fixing a maxi mum it was charged with having killed commerce and pros trated agriculture The law was repealed 2nd Nivose 22nd December I 794 The maximum was not the only evil from which agriculture and commerce suffered The sudden fall in value of the assig nats another consequence of the close of the tyranny of the Terror forced the Convention to increase the issues from January I794 to October I795 more than I2 milliards were created Hence the fall of 98 per cent which we have noted What could be done with a money so debased  All social rela tions based on money values were disturbed In Messidor of the year III a pound more exactly a livre or I lb I oz IOY4 dr avoirdupois weight of bread cost i6 livres in assignats in Brumaire of the year IV 20 livres a bottle of brandy was worth 30 livres in Messidor of the year III 70 in Vendemaire of the year IV IOO livres one month later a turkeyTHE ASSIGNATS I9I and two pullets were worth 400 livres in Vendemaire of the year IV and eight months later in Prairial under the Directory the turkey rose in value to goo livres and a bunch of matches to ten livres VI THE END OF THE ASSIGNATS UNDER THE DIRECTORY The Directory which succeeded the Convention had from the first but one idea with regard to the assignats to rid itself as soon as possible of a currency which had lost almost all value and which crippled the administration no less than it crippled commerce All expedients fail wrote the Directory in its first message to the Council of Five Hundred a most appalling catastrophe threatens to destroy the Republic altogether unless some active and powerful remedy shall change as it were in a moment the aspect of affairs A forced loan was proposed and voted but proved ineffective as it had been under the Con vention Other projects failed The system of assignats was condemned however  No measures can relieve the financial straits of the government Eschasseriaux declared to the Con seil des Anciens The issues of assignats were to remedy all dis orders and cover all expenditures the ministry of war has become an abyss On Ist Nivose of the year IV 22nd December I795 the Conseil des Anciens resolved that the amount of assignats printed should be raised as soon as possible to forty milliards including all that might at that time be in circulation and that immediately afterward the plates and stamps should be publicly broken and that the assignats should be burned as fast as they were paid back into the Treasury The Conseil des Anciens approved it and the decree was put into execution In fact on the 30th Pluviose of the year IV I8th February I796 at nine oclock in the morning with a great crowd of people looking on all the tools which had been used in printing assignats were brought to the Place Vendome the plates and stamps were broken and reams of paper and II67 millions of assignats burned Some days later Camus announced to the192 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY Assembly that the total issue of assignats since the month of April I790 had been 4548I millions that more than six mil liards had been cancelled leaving in circulation 39287 millions That is a mistake cried one of the deputies So much obscurity surrounded the matter that the deputies who gave it the most attention were not themselves agreed upon amounts of the issues Ramel however minister at that time gives figures agreeing pretty closely with those given by Camus From his figures it appeared that the Treasury had paid out all told forty eight and onehalf milliards in assignats nominal valuea number which appears incredible at first sight But when one reflects that the last quotation on the Paris Bourse 2ISt Prairial of the year IV was 3 sous 6 deniers in coin for an assignat of I00 livres it appears that the 35420 millions outstanding at that date 2 represented only 62 million francs a sum altogether insuffi cient for the purposes of exchange spite of the depressed state of trade To the assignats thus distributed the Government afforded a refuge by receiving them in payments on the forced loan at the I Issues authorized by Millions of Livres The Constituent Assembly   i800 The Legislative Assembly   goo The Convention   7178

thinks that the actual circulation never exceeded 30 milliardsTHE A SSIGNATS I93 rate of I00 livres in assignats for one livre of the loan It pro vided a second refuge in permitting them to be exchanged for land scrip mandats territoriaux at the rate of 30 livres in assignats for one livre in land scrip A law of gth Messidor of the year IV announced that assignats of higher denominations than I00 livres which had not been exchanged for land scrip by the 30th of the month would be cancelled Small assignats of five livres and upward were put upon an equal footing with the land scrip that is they might be used in direct purchase of public domain at one thirtieth of their face value and at the rate of I00 for one in payment of contributions still unpaid until Ist Ger minal of the year IV Henceforth the assignats were nothing more than waste paper repudiated by the State as they were rejected by com merce since 2ISt Prairial of the year IV they were not quoted on the Bourse and had ceased to circulate It was stupendous bankruptcy VII THE LAND SCRIP On the I 7th Ventose of the year IV the Directory had obtained authority to place on sale for the retiring of assignats national property to the value of one milliard and to hold 8oo million more at their disposition to defray the cost of the war A sec ond law of 20th Ventose placed immediately on sale the i8oo millions worth of property and authorized the Directory to print for the use of the Treasury 6oo millions in land scrip A holder of this scrip might present it in any department where he wished to purchase landed property the value of the land was to be determined by two experts one chosen by the department the other by the purchaser and an immediate deed of sale given the purchaser paying onehalf down in scrip and the remainder within one month On the 2Sth Ventose a third law increased the amount of scrip to be created from 6oo millions to 2400 millions in coupons of denominations from one livre to 5oo livres While awaiting the printing of the scrip the Directory was authorized to issue promises to pay in scripI94 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY The land scrip as we have said was intended to serve as a means of converting assignats at the rate of 30 francs in assig nats for one franc in land scrip so that the scrip should come to be the only outstanding paper of the Republic It might be used in the purchase of public property on a basis of twentytwo times the rental in case of land and eighteen times the rental in case of buildings Contracts newly entered into between individuals or with the state were to be paid at par in silver or in scrip Old contracts made during the period of assignats were to be paid in silver or in scrip but on a scale constructed for that purpose Land scrip said the Directory possesses an advantage which assignats did not have the lack of which caused the depre ciation of the assignats This quality conferred upon scrip is that of being convertible at any time without competition with out hindrance without bidding at auction by the immediate and incontestable preemption of that portion of the public domain upon which the bearer has fixed his choice in any part of the Reublic It is a land bank whose assets are palpable and noto rious a bank whose notes are convertible at sight and whose security is fortified by the authority of the law which makes the notes a legal tender And it adds Your fate 0 French men is entirely in your own hands if the law dealing with the land scrip is faithfully observed France will emerge from her revolution prosperous and triumphant if that law be not respected a profound abyss lies across your path The abyss was a reality and it could not be filled up with land scrip Neither its pretended easy convertibility nor its forced circulation nor the menaces of the government against stockjobbers could sustain the scrip In Germinal of the year IV when the promises to pay scrip began to get into circulation they were at first quoted on the Bourse at i8 francs for a IOO franc note and the scrip fell even more rapidly than the assignats had done so that three months later in Thermidor it was not worth more than a third of what it had been  5 francs I 7 sous  Undoubtedly there was speculation but the government could not blame the speculators for quotTHE ASSIGNA TS I95 ing scrip at i8 francs per I00 for the government had itself fixed the rate of exchange with assignats at 30 to i and 3000 francs in assignats was in Germinal worth only I2 francs and the Directory forgot as the issuers of the assignats had forgotten that paper which can be exchanged for land and not coin is not money For some months scrip maintained a value of from seven to three francs per I 00 francs only because speculators cal culated that with 2200 francs in silver they might acquire real estate yielding a revenue of I000 francsa paying transaction of which some individuals took advantage but which did not strengthen the credit of the Republic The Directory which had for a time hoped to keep up the value of the scrip by suppression of the assignats in Messidor June I795 decreed that scrip should no longer be received except in part payment for public property and at the rate of exchange quoted on the Bourse then that it should not be received at all then that seven francs in scrip were to be accepted as the equivalent of one franc in silver in payment of taxes Five months later I3th Frimaire of the year VDecember I796 it was made receivable for taxes at its market value as quoted on the Bourse then i6th Pluviose5th February I 797 scrip and assig nats of denominations below I00 livres ceased to be legal tender Scrip for I00 livres was worth at that time 20 sous On the 8th Floreal 28th April it dropped from the list of quotations and a decree dated 2d Prairial 2ISt May definitively repudiated the 2I milliards of assignats outstanding and the 24000 million in scrip which had been issued VIII THE PUBLIC LANDS AND THE PUBLIC DEBT The entire body of the public estates had been pledged as security for this paper money These estates which had been worth according to Montesquiou three and onehalf milliards in September I 79 I had been increased as we have said by confisca When IOO francs in scrip was worth I2 francs in silver that is when scrip first appeared in Floreal of the year IV196 JOURNAL OF IOLITICAL ECONOMY tion of the estates of cmigres and by the conquests of the Republic Ramel estimated their total value under the Directory at 3300 million francs but this is an underestimate According to the figures given by him the actual value of the property purchased by the assignats was i5oo million2 but the price assessed to be paid in assignats was 7483 million From 28th Ventose of the year IV to 20th Fructidor of the same year 6i millions of property actual value and rentes capitalized at 305 million were sold for scrip and money3 The capital value of the public debt payable under the Directory was estimated by Ramel at I304 millions capital value4 or twelve and a half millions in rentes of which the greater portion was paid off during the period of depre ciated paper money5 To this payable debt the liquidation of the old regime was added all arrears of the Revolutionary period Calculating the capital value of the rentes in perpetuity of the life annuities and of the pensions Ramel placed the total debt at about six milliards6 I Ramels estimate is partly conjectural and rests on the supposed real value of the properties not upon the selling

24th August I793 this law conisolidated the permanent debt but without really improving the position of the holders of rentes who were for the time paid only irregularly and by small installments They were paid in assignats at their face value and were obliged to submit to a deduction of onefifth of their dues under the name of tax A law of 21St September 1796 allowed them it is true to receive one quarter of their dues in coin but the provisions of this law could not be carried out A law of the gth Vendemaire year VI 30th September 1797 treated creditors still more harshly It declared that  every entry in the Grandlivre whether a perpetual or a life annuity liquidated or to be liquidated should be paid off to the extent of twothirds of it onethird being retained on the Grandlivre Payment was in fact made but in paper which had practically no value and the consolidated third as it was called was entered in a new Grandlivre and was not paid in anything but paper until i8oi It was in fact a repudiation to the extent of twothirds which reduced the rentes in perpetuity to 435 mill ions and the life annuities payable by the State to perhaps2 a score of millions IX SOME CONCLUSIONS We have given a brief account of the course of events We ought in concluding to indicate what is the responsibility of those who participated in these events and what lessons Finan cial Science may draw from this gigantic experiment I It is an error to suppose that everything of value may be used as money or even as security for a medium of exchange Land although regarded by the Physiocrats as the most stable of all property is entirely unsuited for monetary purposes for since it IThe bonds of the twothirds were for a time receivable in payments for public lands under the Consulate they exchanged for rentes at the rate of 2000 francs for 5 francs in rentes 2T1he exact figure is not known198 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONO11Y cannot be transported or divided at will as the precious metals can the note representing it cannot be redeemed with ease and it is unsuitable because the great majority of note holders do not wish to become purchasers of land 2 Paper drives out specie Thus metallic money disappears or becomes so rare when paper money is issued in excess that it can be bought only at exorbitant prices this phenomenon mani fests itself in a depreciation of the paper in an abnormal rise in prices and in a general disturbance of circulation 3 A majority of the men of the Revolution were mistaken in this respect and they were confirmed in their error by the belief that the issue of assignats would assure the sale of the public lands and that that sale would assure the triumph of the Revo lution 4 The heaviest responsibility rests upon the Constituent Assembly which cut out of whole cloth a medium of exchange answering to the popular beliefthe illusory belief in a stable money The Assembly admitting that it was a resort to an expedient might have used some prudence in meeting the running expenses until taxes began to yield an income without throwing into circulation millions of assignats to discharge the payable debt this payment might have been made provisionally in cer tificates not to be circulated as money 5 The Legislative Assembly and the Convention finding the Treasury empty and the sole resource at hand the assignats used that resource as they were unable to collect taxes and as they had to carry on war against a European coalition no other course was open to them and they are not culpable on this head 6 But while paper money is a mark of poverty it creates an illusion of wealth and incites to prodigality When it is only necessary to put into operation a few printing presses in order to raise millions a government is not bound to manage so carefully in order to keep expenditures within receipts Moreover a gov ernment which issues paper cannot regulate the quantity accord ing to the needs of exchange because it has no standard by which to measure those needs while metallic money thanks to foreignTIHE A SSIGNA TS 199 trade distributes itself automatically in response to the needs of exchange If the Assembly expended in one year nearly one milliard in assignats worth in coin about 750 million the Con vention in three years issued 22 milliards which may be roughly estimated as worth more probably much more than four milliards not including receipts from loans and from taxes in paper or in kind There was also some waste especially after the assignats came to be issued without authorization by decree and at the same time great confusion for many employes of the govern ment or of the municipalities were poorly paid or not paid at all and it became necessary to grant them aid in kind 7 The government complained a good deal of stockjobbers Speculation ran high The blame however rests upon the gov ernment which fostered speculation by its issues of assignats and of various other kinds of paper and by frequent changes in measures relative to the purchase of land 8 The Convention is responsible for the tyrannical laws by which it laid violent hands on the circulation and on property demonetization of the royal assignats the forced loans proscrip tion of metallic money the maximumlaw Experience has shown that if fear of the scaffold can suspend for a time the fall of a depreciated currency by arresting the whole movement of a nations economic life such reprehensible means simply dam up the evil which they appear to remove and bring on a more headlong fall 9 The Directory was justified in wishing to free itself once for all from the assignats It was wrong in persisting in the Computed on figures of issues and of circulation given by Ramiiel there were issued in milliards

their face value or at least a value higher than the market value as quoted on the Bourse the real expenditures would greatly exceed four milliardls200 JOUIRANAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY fundamental error of believing that the assignats might be replaced by land scrip io The Directory committed a still graver wrong in discharg ing its paper money obligations by repudiation The resorts which the government provided for the assignats and scrip were not sufficient and some milliards remained in the hands of hold ers as worthless paper These milliards of assignats it is true were worth several hundred millions of francs on the Bourse but commonly holders had received them in payments made at differ ent times and had received them at various rates and not fron the Bourse holders should have been assured of indemnification at some fixed rate even if nothing better than certificates of rente Repudiation an evil in itself weighed upon the credit of France and upon the political fortune of the Directory down to the coup detat of the i8th Brumaire i i It has been said that the assignats achieved the successful issue of the Revolution It is true in one sense for several years paper money was almost the only resource and upon it the admin istration subsisted and supported the war which was terminated to the glory of the Republic in 1797 by the treaty of Campo Formi 0o But the same ends might have been attained just as surely aind with less hardship for the government and the people if the legis latures knowing the nature of paper money had used it only so far as was strictly indispensable 12 No government can confidently declare that it will never resort to the expedient of paper money France made its first experiment an altogether futile one at the time of Laws system a second necessary but carried to excess at the time of the assignats a third and a fourth in 1848 and 1870 when the notes of the Bank of France were made legal tender experiments which as they were conducted with prudence and based upon a sound credit were entirely successful and have not involved any sensi ble depreciation Many other states have been obliged at oine time or another to resort to paper money and even today there are states under a regime of paper currency some of them bearing it without much difficulty while others suffer greatlyTHIE A SSIGiVA TS 201 The United States during her war of Independence that is twelve years before the French experiment found herself in a situation analogous to that of France The Americans like the French had suffered from lack of credit from an enormous rise in prices from reverses of fortune and they too condemned and punished stockjobbery When at the end of the year I779 the issue of Continental bills  had reached the limit fixed on Sep

dollars for one dollar then as depre ciation continued at the rate of 40 dollars for one dollar March 1780 But cliscredit fell uipon the second issue as upon the first conversion took place to a very slight extent the new notes did not circulate widely and before the end of 1781 the new paper had disappeared from circulation cancelled in the hands of the holders Like an aged man said Ramsay expiring by the decay of nature without a sign or a groan it gently fell aslcel in the hands of its last possessors At the same time the states issued some 209500000 dollars in paper of various kinds2 and anarchy held complete sway in monetary matters down to the time of the adoption of the Con stitution when uniformity was introduced into the currency and the states of the Union forbidden to issue

an evil that it should be resorted to only to avoid a greater evil that it ought therefore always to be issued sparingly and be sup pressed as soon as possible and that for the honor and credit of the country as for the good of commerce and for the sake of justice it ought not to be repudiated E LEVASSEUR PARIS FiRANCEK

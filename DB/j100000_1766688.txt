between doposits of coal and the occurrence of petroleum Another theory defended by Whitney Hunt Hofer and others ascribes the origin of petroleum to animal remains To test this latter theory Dr Engler has conducted a series of experiments so successful as to demonstrate clearly its possibility at least if not its probability from a chemical point of view First some thousands of saltwater fishes were distilled under strong pressure with the production of a liquid containing nitrogenous bases such as pyridin but having no similarity to petroleum Recalling experi ments of Wetherill and Gregory as to the nature of so called adipocere the idea was conceived that possibly in nature the nitrogenated animal substances were de stroyed and the fatty residue converted into petroleum Animal fat train oil was submitted to distillation under a pressure of 25 atmospheres at a moderate heat of 300 400Q and it was found that 70 per cent or 90 per cent of the theoretical of the train oil was transformed into petroleum The same results were obtained from the other fats like butter hog fat artificial fats the free fatty acids etc Not only illuminating oils were obtained but also the lighter hydrocarbons gasoline ligwin benzine etc and in those parts of the crude oil which show a high boiling point were found and separated paraffin wax and lubricating oils As a matter of fact says Dr Engler I have found in the distillate obtained by decomposition of train oil nearly all of the constituents which have been separated from the natural crude petroleum and even the gases which like natural gas consist essentially of marsh gas For the chemism of the formation of the hydrocarbons Dr Engler refers to a recent paper in the Berichte der Deutschen Chemischer Gesellschajt RETICULATION OF SPINDLECELLED SARCOMA BY A COWLEY MALLY MITNSLOW ENCLAND No subject lends itself more freely to errors of inter pretation than the description of the microscopical ap pearances presented by histological and pathological preparations Even the delineation both manual and photographic of the structure of the Diatomaceae bear some semblance of uniformity in the descriptions of different observers Still to quote Dallinger In the present state of the theory and practice of microscopy it would be extremely unwise to give absolute adhesion to what is now held by some students of diatom structure of no mean repute and of unrivalled manipulative skill to be the absolute struc ture of some of the larger forms The same observation applies with still more force to the former investigations as it is impossible to compare and correllate either the methods of preparation observa tion or interpretation of different observers They all differ as a rule in some detail and in addition there is not only a marked tendency on the part of histologists and pathologists to copy the methods drawings and re sults of others but also a great liability to subjective imitation through suggestion Before confining myself to the evidences of reticulation in sarcomal structures I may mention that the appearance in Polymyxa so interpreted is perfectly evident in some individuals and absolutely imperceptible in others When seen it is extremely evanescent and therefore can scarce ly be looked upon as evidence of the existence of formed material but rather as the effect of some temporary chem ical or physical change in or upon the external surface of the protoplasmic mass The same or very similar appear ances may be observed in Volvox which are equally erratic but as they are unquestionably received as the evidence of formed material the foregoing statement is put forward as only a conditional hypothesis The portion of the tumor from which the accompany ing sketch is taken was placed in Mullers fluid twelve hours before the sections were cut These sections were taken from the central portion where the fluid had evi dently no time to act then slightly stained with carmine mounted in balsam and in the usual way On being ex amined the same evening with a onesixteenth water im mersion and No 12 compensating eyepiece it was found that the markings forming portions of the reticulations took a definite direction that is obliquely lateral to the long diameter of the cell This lateral obliquity did not change on revolution of the stage and therefore cannot be interpreted as the result of oblique illumination In many of the cells a granular nebular nucleus was ob served connected by slender and almost phantom branches with the oblique lateral markings At the junc tion of these branches with the nucleus their point of I  1 4 I  I   4C pPl n  cejle a Oar c ow x  n Jc 9 d  9  C  8  Aa insertion or outgrowth as the case may be seemed to be placed in the hyaline substance surrounding the gran ules and unconnected with the granules themselves This latter observation is not laid down as an established fact but simply as something more than ordinary conjec ture At the points of junction with the lateral markings there seemed to be definite nodal enlargements increasing in frequency towards the edges of the cell and the whole section had a peculiar wateredsilk appearance which it was found impossible to represent on paper On examination of teased preparations it was evident that the sections were cut obliquely as the cells appeared very much elongated at the same time they showed no reticulation Sections from the same portion of the growth were treated with osmic acid and several aniline dyes without effect I am however by no means skeptical as to the results which ought to be obtained in perfectly fresh specimens with chloride of gold Its manipulation is difficult owing to the nature of the tissue changes in temperature light and color definition therefore annoy ingly variable in its results I cannot endorse Chatins statement as quoted by Dr Stokes on p 374 No 517 of this journal that reticulated structure in amoeboides and in the blood corpuscles of 285 I286 SCIENCE invertebrates is constantly and easily demonstrable Chliatin in the previous paragraph referred to osmic acid it is natural to suppose that the organisms and globules were submitted to that treatment a method which at least in my hands has proved extremely uncertain in its results In conclusion allow me to request some of your very numerous correspondents to inform us if the spectroscope would give any material assistance in the solution of the true nature of these markings I of course mean the diffraction spectrum my acquaintance with the instru ment being limited to test fluids Since writing the above my colleague W F Pentland has persuaded me not to be too dogmatic with regard to the reticulation of the invertebrate corpuscles and indi vidual especially conjunctival cells of invertebrates till after next spring as in the meantime he intends working up the subject THE BACTERIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF WATER BY J H STOI LER UNION COLLEGE SCHENECTADY N Y WHEN in 1881 Koch announced the gelatine culture method for bacteria devised by him it was believed that one of its most important applications would be in the examination of waters with reference to their potable use This method as is now well known renders possible an exact determination of the abundance of bacteria in water But it was soon discovered that the mere demonstration of the presence of bacteria was of little value in estimat ing the qualities of waters inasmuch as waters of unques tionable suitability for potable use often contained bac teria in considerable abundance However the general result was established that the numbers of bacteria are in relation to the amount of putrescible organic matter in the water The ideal value of the gelatine culture method not having been realized it is probable that its true useful ness in water analysis has not been estinmated as highly as it deserves An experimenter who has familiarized himself with the distribution of bacterial life in waters will be able to form definite and reliable conclusions up on the basis of numbers of bacteria This is especially true in the case of river water subject to polution by sew age from towns Numerical determinations of abun dance of bacteria having been made of samples taken at various points from the same river a fair judgment may be formed of the amount of sewage polution at any re quired point The first step requisite to be taken is to determine for use as a standard the numbers of bacteria in unpolluted water in the stream under investigation Comparisons made with this standard give reliable quanti tative indications of polution Any access of sewage raises the number of bacteria above the normal for that stream and the excess is a definite indication of the extent to which the water has suffered polution The standard is obtained by testing the water both at such points and at such times as give the condition approaching nearest to purity for that stream In general samples taken from the head waters of the river above the first town from which sewage polution is received and at a time of con tinued fair weather when the water is free from rain wash are best suited for the control tests In regard to the effects of surface washings from the land by rains as indicated by turbidity of the water it is necessary to el iminate them from all tests by taking samples only when the water is clear This rule being observed comparisons of results give indications of the extent of contamina tion due to sewage Vol XXII No 564 It should be added that there are other conditions which enter in a minor degree as factors in the results of numerical determinations of bacteria These are tenm perature of water depth at which the sample is taken point at which the sample is taken with reference to rifts and pools in the stream free ex posure to air and light prevented in winter by ice etc Consideration should always be given to these conditions and as far as possible samples should be taken under similar conditions throughout in order to render the re sults comparable The writer working in association with Prof C C Brown consulting engineer for the New York State Board of Health in furtherance of his work in investigat ing rivers as sources of water supply has made numeri cal determinations of bacteria for some six hundred sam ples of water from the Hudson and Mohawk rivers A statement of the results of this work is given in the an nual reports of the State Board of Health of New York for the years 1891 and 1892 It naturally occured to us early in the work here al luded to that a method of differentiating sewage bacteria from ordinary water bacteria would be of great value as affording a more exact means of ascertaining the degree of sewage pollution than is possible by the method out lined above Dr Theobald Smith of Washington D C was then consulting bacteriologist for the New York State Board of Health and upon submitting the idea to him he informed us of a method of differentiating gasproducing bacteria from others which he had devised and published soime time previously Centralblatt fur Bakteriologie Vol VII p 302 and Vol XII p 367 and which he believed was applicable to the end sought by us The method thus placed at our disposal consists in the use of a culture fluid of which sugar glucose is a com ponent and which is placed for inoculation in tubes simi lar in principle to the ureometer employed by chemists Bacteria capable of causing sugarfermentation when in troduced into such culturetubes give rise to a gas the quantity and composition of which can be ascertained In the application of this method to the bacteriological analysis of water its value rests upon the fact that the most common species of bacteria present in feces are gas generators As is well known the most constantly occur ing species of bacteria in feces is Bacillus coli commune and for some time our experiments related to the determina tion of the abundance of this species in the waters under investigation by means of the characteristic quantity and composition of the gases which it generates in the fermen tationtubes Later others of the more common fecal bac teria were isolated and studied with reference to their gas generating character In this way a method was elabor ated by which it is believed there can be determined with approximate exactness the numbers of prevailing species of fecal bacteria in a unit quantity of water This deter mination is taken as a definite indication of the amount of sewage pollution In the practical use of this method the procedure is as follows The saccharine culture fluid contained in a set say eight of fermentationtubes is inoculated with a measured quantity of water from the source of supply under investigation The tubes are immediately placed in an incubator and kept at a temperature of thirtyeight degrees centigrade for fortyeight hours or somewhat longer This is favorable to the development of fecal bacteria and probable destruction of the greater number of ordinary water bacteria Those tubes in which gas has been developed are then examined withreference to the amount and composition of the gases present and note is taken of those which agree in these respects with the effects produced by known fecal bacteria Finally

UMN ERM UMNATHLETIC CONTROL IN SCHOOL AND COLLEGE W L DUDLEY VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY THE PRINCIPAL OBJECT OF EDUCATION IS TO PREPARE YOUNG MEN TO BE BETTER CITIZENS IS A THOUGHT WHICH FREQUENTLY EMANATES FROM THE COLLEGE ROSTRUM THIS IDEA SEEMS TO BE ACQUIRED VERY SOON AFTER THE YOUTHFUL MIND BEGINS TO TAKE A SERIOUS VIEW OF LIFE THE TRUTH OF THE STATEMENT IS ADMITTED BY ALL BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE KNOWLEDGE GAINED BY EDUCATION IS TOO OFTEN APPLIED TO CITIZENSHIP BY THE INDIVIDUAL HIM SELF UNAIDED BY ANY SUGGESTION OF A PRACTICAL NATURE FROM HIS PRECEPTOR THE STUDENT IS ABUNDANTLY SUPPLIED WITH LECTURES AND TALKS ON MORALS BUT BEYOND THE INJUNCTION THAT HE MUST NOT CHEAT ON EXAMINATION NO VERY CONCRETE APPLICATIONS OF HONESTY ARE GIVEN HIM DURING HIS COLLEGE COURSES MAN HAS AN IMPRESSIBLE AND AN IMITATIVE NATURE HIS STAN DARD OF RIGHT AND WRONG IS VARIABLE AND DEPENDS UPON ENVIRONMENT NO MATTER WHAT HIS PRINCIPLES MAY BE THE AVERAGE MAN WILL ACT SOONER OR LATER ACCORDING TO THE PREVAILING SENTIMENT OF HIS ASSOCIATES FOR THIS REASON OUR COLLEGE MEN SHOULD BE DIRECTED ALONG RIGHT LINES IN EVERY PHASE OF COLLEGE LIFE IN SUCH A WAY AS TO MAKE THEM INDEPENDENT AND SELFRELIANT THE DEVELOPMENT OF ATHLETICS HAS PROGRESSED TO SUCH AN EXTENT DURING THE PAST FEW YEARS THAT MANLY SPORT NOW PLAYS A PROMINENT PART IN COLLEGE LIFE IT HAS COME SO RAPIDLY INTO THE HORIZON THAT MANY OF OUR OLDER COLLEGE OFFICERS HAVE FAILED TO RECOGNIZE IT AS ANYTHING BUT AN UNTIMELY AND UNDESIRABLE INTERLOPER UNWORTHY OF CONSIDERATION AS A USEFUL ADJUNCT TO COLLEGE LIFE THIS IS UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE ATHLETIC SPORT MAY BE MADE A POWERFUL FACTOR IN THE PHYSICAL AND MORAL DEVELOPMENT OF YOUTH THE AVERAGE INSTRUCTOR OR PROFESSOR NATURALLY PREFERS TO DEVOTE HIMSELF EXCLUSIVELY TO HIS WORK IN THE CLASS ROOM OR LABORATORY FOR WHICH HE HAS BEEN SPECIFICALLY EMPLOYED AND WHICH IN MOST INSTITUTIONS MORE THAN CONSUMES HIS TIME AND STRENGTH BUT THIS IS ONLY A PORTION OF HIS DUTY HE MAY NOT BE A MAN WHO CAN ADAPT HIMSELF TO CLOSE SOCIAL INTERCOURSE WITH THE STUDENT BUT EVERY TEACHER SHOULD IN SOME WAY IN THE FACULTY OR OUT OF IT DEVOTE MORE OR LESS OF HIS TIME AND THOUGHT TO AFFAIRS THAT WILL PROVE HELPFUL IREAD AT THE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND PREPARATORY SCHOOLS OF THE SOUTHERN STATES THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI NOVEMBER 1902 95THE SCHOOL REVIEW IN FORMING CHARACTER BY INSTILLING PROPER IDEALS INTO THE MINDS OF THE YOUNG AN INSTRUCTOR WHO CANNOT OR WILL NOT DO THIS IS NOT FITTED FOR A POSITION AS A COLLEGE OR SCHOOL OFFICER ALTHOUGH SUCH AN ONE WHO IS A PROFOUND SCHOLAR MIGHT FULFIL A MISSION IN A UNIVERSITY WHERE HE HAS TO DEAL ONLY WITH POSTGRADUATES NEVERTHELESS EVEN THERE HIS WORTH AS TEACHER WOULD BE LARGELY DISCOUNTED THE VALUE OF ATHLETIC SPORT UNDER PROPER CONTROL IN COLLEGE LIFE MAY BE SUMMED UP IN PART AS FOLLOWS IT AFFORDS PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT TO THE GREAT MASS OF STUDENTS AS WELL AS TO THE MEMBERS OF THE TEAMS BY AROUSING AN AMBITION TO BE STRONG AND STURDY THUS ENCOURAGING PHYSICAL EXERCISE IN ALL OF ITS PHASES IT TEACHES THE WHOLE STUDENT BODY THE PROPER CONTROL OF TEMPER UNDER STRESS IT FURNISHES RECREATION OF A FATIGUING CHARACTER WHICH REDUCES TO A MINIMUM THE DESIRE FOR FORMS OF AMUSEMENT WHICH LEAD TO THE UNLIMITED WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY IF NOTHING MORE INTERCOLLEGIATE SPORT AROUSES COLLEGE LOYALTY AS NOTHING ELSE CAN AND IT SUCCESSFULLY PUTS AT REST ALL DISTRACTING AND HURTFUL DISSENSIONS IT TEACHES HONESTY AND GENEROSITY WHICH ARE TERMS SYNONYMOUS WITH SPORTMANSHIP IN DEALING WITH RIVALS IF THIS BE TRUE THEN SURELY ATHLETICS SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED AND IT IS TRUE BUT ONLY WHEN ATHLETICS ARE DIRECTED ALONG THE PROPER LINES IF THIS BE TRUE THE QUESTIONS INVOLVED ARE TOO GREAT AND TOO COMPLEX TO BE COMMITTED TO THE UNGUIDED HANDS OF THE STUDENTS THE FACULTY MUST AID IN THEIR MANAGEMENT AND IF IT DOES NOT NONE OF THE BENE FITS ENUMERATED WILL BE SECURED THUS UNCONTROLLED THE INFLUENCE OF COLLEGE ATHLETICS WILL BE BAD WHOLLY BAD WITH NOT ONE REDEEMING FEATURE IF IT BE NECESSARY TO SHOW THAT STUDENT MANAGEMENT OF ATHLETICS IS DISASTROUS AN OCCURRENCE WHICH TOOK PLACE AT VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY LAST SPRING MAY BE CITED A BASEBALL TEAM OF A COLLEGE FROM ANOTHER STATE HAD AGREED TO PLAY UNDER THE LAWS OF THE SOUTHERN INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION THE MANAGER BROUGHT A LIST OF HIS PLAYERS PROPERLY CERTIFIED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE INSTITUTION WHICH THE TEAM REPRESENTED AT THE END OF THE FIRST GAME IT WAS LEARNED THAT ONE OF THE PLAYERS WAS NOT THE PERSON HE PURPORTED TO BE THE MANAGER STATED POSITIVELY THAT HE WAS AS REPRESENTED BUT INVESTIGATION PROVED THAT HE HAD NOT TOLD THE TRUTH HE AFTERWARD EXPRESSED REGRET THAT HE HAD HAD TO LIE  AND ADDED INCIDENTALLY  THAT ALL OF THE TEAM HAD AGREED TO LIE IN CASE THE IDENTITY OF THE MAN WAS QUESTIONED IT DEVELOPED LATER THAT A SECOND MAN ON THE TEAM WAS PLAYING UNDER ANOTHERS NAME 96ATHLETIC CONTROL IN SCHOOL AND COLLEGE THE MANAGER HAD GONE FROM BIS COLLEGE TOWN WITH A BONAFIDE TEAM PROPERLY CERTIFIED BUT HE HAD LEFT TWO OF HIS MEN IN A NEARBY VILLAGE AND RECRUITED TWO ALIENS WHO ASSUMED THE NAMES OF THE DISCARDED STUDENTS THE MANAGER WAS A YOUNG MAN OF EXCELLENT FAMILY WHO HAD ALL THE EXTERNAL EVIDENCES OF BEING A GENTLEMAN BUT HE HAD FALLEN A VICTIM TO THE LAX SYSTEM OF ATHLETIC MORALS OF HIS COLLEGE AND AT LEAST TWELVE OF HIS ASSOCIATES HAD ABSORBED THE TAINT THE PUBLIC EXPECT THAT EVERY ACT AND EVERY EVENT CONNECTED WITH AN INSTITUTION OF LEARNING SHALL BE CONDUCTED ON A HIGH MORAL PLANE AND IN FACT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO DEMAND THAT IT BE SO THE FACULTY IS HELD RESPONSIBLE IN THE PUBLIC MIND FOR ITS OWN ACTS AND FOR THOSE OF THE STUDENTS THE FACULTY IS THE RESPONSIBLE HEAD OF AN INSTITUTION OF LEARNING AND IF IT IS CONSIDERATE JUST AND FIRM WILL SOON HAVE A BODY OF STUDENTS TO DEAL WITH WHO POSSESS THE SAME QUALITIES OBSERVATION LEADS ONE TO THE CONCLUSION THAT WHEN THE STUDENT BODY IS RIOTOUS REBELLIOUS OR DISHONEST IN ATHLETICS THE MEMBERS OF THE FACULTY ARE FOR SOME CAUSE FAILING WISELY TO CONCERN THEMSELVES WITH THE THINGS THAT APPEAL MOST STRONGLY TO THE STUDENTS AS A WHOLE IF A STUDENT CHEATS ON EXAMINATION OR IS GUILTY OF SOME OTHER FLAGRANT BREACH OF MORALS THE FACULTY PROMPTLY CONDEMNS HIM AND HE MUST GO IF A BODY OF STUDENTS SURREPTITIOUSLY PUTS A PLAYER WHO IS NOT A MATRICULATE ON THE COLLEGE BASEBALL TEAM AND THUS CHEAT ANOTHER COLLEGE WHAT THEN  IF A STUDENT CHEATS ON AN EXAMINATION AND HE IS NOT CONDEMNED AND DISMISSED IS NOT THE FACULTY CONDEMNED BY THE STUDENT BODY AND THE PUBLIC AS WELL  IF AN ALLEGED ATHLETE PLAYS ON A TEAM IS NOT THE FACULTY ALSO CONDEMNED  THE STUDENTS MAY NOT TALK OF IT AND THE SENSATIONAL REPORTER MAY NOT WRITE IT BUT A FACULTY THAT PERMITS SUCH A BREACH OF MORALS WILL NOT COMMAND THE RESPECT A FAC ULTY SHOULD RECEIVE FROM EITHER THE STUDENTS OR THE PUBLIC THE PUBLIC IS NOT SATISFIED WITH THE EXCUSE THE FACULTY DOES NOT CONCERN ITSELF WITH ATHLETICS THAT IS AN AFFAIR OF THE STUDENTS WHEN A COLLEGE TEAM IS CHARGED WITH PLAYING AN IMPROPER PERSON WHEN GOSSIP OF ATHLETIC DISHONESTY IS RIFE AMONG STUDENT BODIES OR WHEN UNSEEMLY QUARRELS BETWEEN COLLEGES OVER ATHLETIC CONTESTS FIND EXPRESSION IN THE PUBLIC PRINTS IT IS NOT ENOUGH FOR THE FACULTY TO ANNOUNCE THAT THEY DO NOT INTERFERE WITH THE AFFAIRS OF THE STUDENTS SUCH THINGS ARE NOT AFFAIRS OF THE STUDENTS AND THE PUBLIC IS NOT SAT ISFIED WITH THIS ATTEMPT TO SHIFT RESPONSIBILITY ATHLETIC TEAMS REPRE SENT THE COLLEGE THEY BEAR ITS NAME AND THEIR DOINGS REFLECT CREDIT OR DISCREDIT ON THE INSTITUTION AND ON THOSE WHOM THE PUBLIC ARE TOLD 97THE SCHOOL REVIEW THROUGH ITS LITERATURE ARE ITS GUIDING OFFICERS SUPPOSE AN ATHLETIC TEAM COMPOSED OF PERSONS NOT CONNECTED WITH THE COLLEGE SHOULD ASSUME THE NAME OF THE INSTITUTION WOULD ITS AUTHORITIES BE SLOW IN NOTIFYING THE PUBLIC THAT THE NAME WAS USURPED  EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN THAT WHEN FACULTIES TAKE THIS POSITION THEY ARE BESET WITH THE SAME MOTIVE WHICH POSSESSES MOST YOUNG STUDENTS THAT IS TO WIN AT ALL HAZARDS OR THAT THEY HAVE NOT STUDIED THE QUES TION OF ATHLETICS CAREFULLY OR THAT THEY ARE TOO PARTISAN TO VIEW THE GREAT QUESTION OF AMATEUR SPORT IN A CLEAR AND SPORTSMANLIKE LIGHT YOUNG MEN MAY BE EXCUSED FOR CONTRACTED VIEWS BUT TEACHERS SHOULD TRAIN THEMSELVES OUT OF NARROW PATHS A COLLEGE PRESIDENT SAID TO ME A SHORT TIME AGO THAT WHILE HE BELIEVED THE FACULTY SHOULD MAINTAIN CAREFUL SUPERVISION OVER ATHLETICS YET IT WAS A QUESTION WHICH SOME TIMES VEXED HIM VERY MUCH AS IT CAUSED THE MOST LENGTHY AND ACRI MONIOUS DISCUSSIONS WHICH WERE HAD AT THE FACULTY MEETINGS THERE WERE QUESTIONS OF ELIGIBILITY OVER WHICH THE FACULTY SPLIT HAIRS THEY DID NOT SEEM TO REALIZE THAT UNLESS A STUDENT WAS CLEARLY ELIGIBLE HE SHOULD NOT BE PERMITTED TO REPRESENT THE INSTITUTION ON ANY TEAM THE FACULTY WOULD NOT HAVE DONE ANYTHING ELSE IN WHICH THEIR HONOR OR THAT OF THE INSTITUTION WAS LIABLE TO BE QUESTIONED IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE AND YET IT WOULD QUIBBLE OVER ATHLETIC ETHICS AND FOR WHAT THE OUT COME OF SOME GAME WHEN FACULTIES BANDY MORAL AND ETHICAL QUES TIONS ABOUT SEEKING SOME SOPHISTICAL ARGUMENT OR TECHNICALITY TO JUSTIFY A BREACH OF THE SPIRIT IF NOT THE LETTER OF THE LAW WHAT CAN BE EXPECTED OF THE STUDENT BODY  INTEREST IN A CONTEST WHICH IS LIABLE TO WARP MENS MENTAL VISION IS AN EXPLANATION BUT NO EXCUSE BUT WHY SHOULD GROWN MEN APPOINTED TO GUIDE YOUTH AND ACCUSTOMED TO SIT IN A JUDICIAL CAPACITY ALLOW THEMSELVES TO FORGET THAT THEY SHOULD ACT AS IMPARTIAL JUDGES WHEN A QUESTION OF ATHLETICS IS INVOLVED  WE MUST ADMIT THAT IT IS DIFFICULT FOR MEN TO GET AWAY FROM THEIR ENVIRONMENT AND THE MAN WHO RISES ABOVE IT IS LIKELY TO BE MISUNDER STOOD IF A COLLEGE PROFESSOR DECIDES A QUESTION OF ATHLETICS UPON HIGH ETHICAL GROUNDS AND THE DECISION REMOVES SOME TITAN FROM THE FIELD HE IS LIABLE TO INCUR THE DISPLEASURE OF THE MULTITUDE UNTIL THE MASSES BECOME EDUCATED THIS REFINEMENT OF ATHLETIC MORALS WILL NOT REQUIRE MUCH TIME NOR MANY RIGHTEOUS DECISIONS BUT IN ANY CASE DIFFERENCES OF OPINIONS ARE LIKELY TO ARISE WHERE THE PERSONALITY OF THE ATHLETE IN QUESTION ENTERS IT THUS STRICTLY JUST DECISIONS ARE DIFFICULT TO REACH THIS POINT MAY BE ILLUSTRATED BY CITING TWO CASES WHERE THE QUES TION INVOLVED THE VIOLATION OF THE LAW AGAINST PROFESSIONALISM WHICH 98ATHLETIC CONTROL IN SCHOOL AND COLLEGE FORBIDS ANYONE PLAYING WHO HAS RECEIVED MONEY OR COMPENSATION EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FOR HIS ATHLETIC SERVICES CASE IA STUDENT HAD PLAYED SUMMER BASEBALL AND RECEIVED 5 PER GAME FOR HIS SERVICES HE HELD A POSITION AS CLERK IN A STORE DUR ING THE SUMMER AND WHEN HE LEFT THE STORE TO PLAY HIS WAGES CEASED FOR THE TIME HE WAS ABSENT HE WAS DECLARED A PROFESSIONAL ACCORD ING TO THE LAW CITED ABOVE AND THE DECISION WAS PROTESTED ON THE GROUND THAT HE WAS A POOR BOY WHO NEEDED THE MONEY TO PAY HIS WAY THROUGH COLLEGE  THAT HE PLAYED SIMPLY BECAUSE HE LOVED THE GAME THAT HE WAS NOT BENEFITED FINANCIALLY BY PLAYING FOR HAD HE REMAINED IN THE STORE HE WOULD HAVE RECEIVED THE SAME AMOUNT OF COMPENSA TION AND THAT HE COULD NOT AFFORD TO PLAY AND LOSE HIS SALARY IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS CONTENDED THAT HE WAS NOT PLAYING FOR MONEY BUT THE BASEBALL CLUB WAS SIMPLY PAYING HIS SALARY FOR WORKING IN THE STORE YET IN REALITY HE WAS PLAYING BASEBALL CASE 2A STUDENT PLAYED SUMMER BASEBALL AND CLERKED IN A STORE WHEN HE WAS ABSENT HE WAS OBLIGED TO EMPLOY A CLERK TO SUBSTITUTE FOR HIM IN THE STORE HE RECEIVED MONEY FOR PLAYING IN SUFFICIENT AMOUNT TO PAY FOR THE SERVICES OF THE SUBSTITUTE IN THE STORE HE WAS DECLARED A PROFESSIONAL AND THE DECISION IN CASE I WAS CITED AS A PRECEDENT THE FACULTY COMMITTEE WROTE THAT THEY DID NOT CONSIDER THE CASES PARALLEL IN ANY RESPECT AND THEY OBJECTED TO THE ACTION A LONG CORRESPONDENCE FOLLOWED WITH ONE OF THE FACULTY AND HE COULD NOT BE CONVINCED THAT THE DECISION WAS RIGHT UNTIL IT WAS EXPLAINED THAT ACCORDING TO THE INTERPRETATION FOR WHICH HE CONTENDED NO PLAYER NEED EVER BECOME A PROFESSIONAL AS SHOWN BY THE FOLLOWING HYPOTHETICAL CASE SUPPOSE A BASEBALL PLAYER SHOULD OBTAIN A POSITION AS A CLERK IN A STORE AND WITH THE CONSENT OF HIS EMPLOYER ENGAGE A SUBSTITUTE WHO PERMANENTLY FILLED THE PLACE IN THE MEANTIME THE ATHLETE JOINS A BASEBALL TEAM AND PLAYS REGULARLY BUT THE BASEBALL MANAGER PAYS THE CLERKS SALARY AND THE MERCHANT PAYS THE ATHLETES SALARY THUS ACCORDING TO THE INTERPRETATION OF THE FAC ULTY COMMITTEE THE CLERK WHO DID NOT PLAY BALL WOULD BECOME A PRO FESSIONAL ATHLETE AND THE ATHLETE WOULD BE SIMPLY A CLERK THIS CONDITION OF AFFAIRS IS EASILY REMEDIED BY HAVING A COMMITTEE OF GENTLEMEN REPRESENTING VARIOUS COLLEGES WHOSE DUTY IT IS TO DECIDE ALL CASES OF ELIGIBILITY ACCORDING TO CERTAIN RULES WHICH HAVE BEEN MUTUALLY AGREED UPON IN THIS WAY ONLY CAN UNIFORMITY OF INTERPRETATION OF LAW BE REACHED IN THIS WAY ALL ACRIMONIOUS AND TEDIOUS DISCUSSION OVER ATHLETIC MATTERS IN FACULTY MEETINGS CAN BE DISPENSED WITH AND 997HE SCHOOL REVIEW IN THIS WAY ALL ESTRANGEMENT BETWEEN THE STUDENTS AND THE FACULTY CAN BE AVOIDED IF THIS COMMITTEE IS COMPOSED OF FIVE MEMBERS REPRE SENTING AS MANY INSTITUTIONS THEIR DECISIONS WILL ALWAYS BE JUST AND ACCORDING TO LAW IT MAY HAPPEN THAT ONE OR EVEN TWO OF THE COM MITTEE MAY BE INTERESTED PARTIES BUT IN EITHER CASE THE MAJORITY OF THE COMMITTEE WILL BE WHOLLY DISINTERESTED EIGHT YEARS AGO AN ORGANIZATION NOW COMPOSED OF ABOUT TWENTY COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WAS FORMED IN THE SOUTH KNOWN AS THE SOUTHERN INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION WHICH FROM A SMALL BEGINNING HAS GRADUALLY GROWN STRONGER UNTIL ITS INFLUENCE IS NOW FELT OVER MOST OF THE SOUTHERN TERRITORY THIS ASSOCIATION MEETS ANNUALLY BUT ITS AFFAIRS ARE CONTROLLED AND ITS LAWS ARE ENFORCED AD INTERIM BY AN EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE COMPOSED OF FIVE MEMBERS CHOSEN FROM AS MANY INSTITUTIONS WHILE THE LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE IT YET THIS COM MITTEE IS COMPOSED OF MEMBERS OF THE FACULTIES OF THE INSTITUTIONS REPRESENTED ON IT AND NEVER HAS LESS THAN A MAJORITY CONSISTED OF PROFESSORS NONE OF ITS DECISIONS HAS EVER BEEN SET ASIDE OR REVERSED BY THE ASSOCIATION TO WHICH IT REPORTS ANNUALLY YEAR BY YEAR ITS WORK WILL BECOME EASIER AND ITS INFLUENCE ALREADY GREAT WILL BECOME GREATER THE GOOD IT HAS DONE IS INCALCULABLE AND ALTHOUGH THE WORK HAS BROUGHT UNPLEASANT RETURNS TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE PER SONALLY YET THE TRUE REWARD IS IN THE REALIZATION OF THE FACT THAT THE INFLUENCE OF THIS WORK NPON THE MORALS OF OUR COLLEGE MEN IS NEXT IN IMPORTANCE TO THAT OF THE CHURCH AND THE Y M C A A COMPLAINT MADE BY A FEW AGAINST THE ATHLETIC SUPERVISION OF SUCH A COMMITTEE IS THAT IT ASSUMES AUTHORITY OVER MATTERS WHICH EACH INSTI TUTION SHOULD SETTLE FOR ITSELF IT IS TRUE THAT EACH INSTITUTION SHOULD DO SO AND NO DOUBT MOST OF THEM WOULD IF THEY COULD BUT EXPERIENCE SHOWS THAT THE FACULTY CANNOT LEARN ALL OF THE FACTS CONCERNING THE ATHLETIC PEDIGREES OF ITS STUDENTS AS READILY AS THOSE ON THE OUTSIDE PARENTS KNOW LESS ABOUT THE MORAL OBLIQUITIES OF THEIR BOY THAN DO THEIR NEIGHBORS RELIABLE INFORMATION WILL COME TO AN OUTSIDE COM MITTEE WHICH WILL NEVER REACH AN OFFICER OF THE UNIVERSITY AND THE EFFORTS OF ANY COTERIE OF STUDENTS OR ALUMNI TO DECEIVE THEIR FACULTY WILL USUALLY REACH THE COMMITTEE ANY FACULTY SHOULD BE GLAD TO GO INTO AN ASSOCIATION WITH SUCH A TRIBUNAL TO TRY CASES OF ELIGIBILITY AND IF IT WILL TEST ITS EFFICACY FAIRLY THEY WILL SOON APPRECIATE ITS VALUE FOR THE RESPONSIBILITY IS THROWN ON DISINTERESTED PERSONS AND THE FACULTY ARE RELIEVED OF THE ODIUM OF A DECISION ADVERSE TO THE PERSONAL DESIRES OF THE MASS OF THE STUDENTS THE OBJECT IS HONESTY AND IF IT IS BEST I00ATHLETIC CONTROL IN SCHOOL AND COLLEGE ATTAINED BY A PARTICULAR METHOD WHY OBJECT SO LONG AS IT IS HONOR ABLE THIS METHOD COUPLED WITH STRICT FACULTY SUPERVISION IS AS NEAR PERFECT AS ANY WHICH CAN BE DEVISED EVERY FACULTY COMMITTEE SOON REALIZES THE EFFICIENCY OF AN OUTSIDE BODY IN GAINING INFORMATION FOR IN SPITE OF THE VIGILANCE OF THE FACULTY ITS MEMBERS ARE FREQUENTLY SURPRISED TO FIND WHERE LEAST EXPECTED RELIABLE EVIDENCE OF CORRUP TION IN THE HANDS OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE ASSOCIATION THIS ASSOCIATION WAS NOT ORGANIZED TO INSTITUTE OR FOSTER THAT WILL O THE WISP THAT PROMOTER AND HARBORER OF PROFESSIONALISM AND COR RUPTION COMMONLY KNOWN AS CHAMPIONSHIP IT WAS ORGANIZED TO PROMOTE SPORTSMANSHIP HONOR AND MORALS IT WAS ORGANIZED TO DEVELOP MEN BRAVE STRONG COURTEOUS HONORABLE MEN WHO CAN MAINTAIN ALL THE ATTRIBUTES OF GENTLEMEN IN THE HEAT OF CONTEST THE LAWS OF THE ASSOCIATION ARE FRAMED WITH THIS END IN VIEW AND THIS ONLY THE ASSOCIATION ENCOURAGES AND HEARTILY DESIRES THE COOPERATION OF FACULTY ATHLETIC COMMITTEES REALIZING THAT THE FULLEST MEASURE OF SUC CESS CANNOT BE ATTAINED WITHOUT IT SUCH COMMITTEES SHOULD BE COM POSED OF TEMPERATE AND WELLBALANCED MEN WHO CAN CALMLY DISCUSS A QUESTION WITHOUT WARPED JUDGMENT OCCASIONALLY PERSONS CONNECTED WITH INSTITUTIONS OUTSIDE THE JURIS DICTION OF THE ORGANIZATION HAVE SNEERINGLY REFERRED TO THE WORK OF THE ASSOCIATION AND CITED CASES OF ATHLETIC IMPURITY WITHIN ITS BOUNDS OR MADE RECKLESS CHARGES WITHOUT FOUNDATION OF FACT THE SCOFFERS HAVE NOT STATED THAT THE IRREGULARITIES WERE CORRECTEDAN IMPOSSIBILITY IN THEIR INSTITUTIONS THEY DO NOT SEEM TO REALIZE THAT IT IS NO DISGRACE TO AN INSTITUTION WHEN IRREGULARITIES ARE DISCOVERED IN THE ELIGIBILITY OF ONE OF ITS ATHLETES BUT THAT IT IS A DISGRACE IF SUCH A MAN IS NOT REMOVED FROM A TEAM OR IF NO EFFORT IS MADE TO DISCOVER SUCH MEN THE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF COLLEGE SPORT IS AMATEURISM THERE ARE SOME MEN WHO HOLD THAT SO LONG AS A MAN IS A BONA FIDE STUDENT HE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO PLAY ON A COLLEGE TEAM BUT HAPPILY THIS CLASS OF MEN IS GRADUALLY DISAPPEARING THE NECESSITY FOR EXCLUDING PROFES SIONALISM IN ALL PHASES AND DEGREES IS NOT WORTHY OF DISCUSSION SINCE IT IS APPARENT TO ALL RIGHTTHINKING PEOPLE THAT THE MATRICULATION REQUIRE MENT ALONE WOULD RESULT IN TEAMS MADE UP OF HIRELINGS WHO MIGHT WIN GAMES BUT THE REAL OBJECT OF COLLEGE SPORTTHE DEVELOPMENT OF YOUTHWOULD BE ENTIRELY ELIMINATED EXPERIENCE HOWEVER HAS SHOWN THAT BETTER TEAMS CAN BE MADE OF BONA FIDE COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO HAVE THEIR FULL QUOTA OF CLASS WORK THAN OF HIRELINGS AND DRONES SUCH MEN LACK THE COLLEGE SPIRIT EARNESTNESS OF PURPOSE AND ENTHUSI 1OITHE SCHOOL REVIEW ASM WHICH ARE NECESSARY FOR THE HIGHEST ATTAINMENT A DEFINITE TIME WITHIN WHICH TO MATRICULATE AND A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF COLLEGE WORK ARE NECESSARY REQUIREMENTS TO PREVENT A MAN FROM ATTENDING COLLEGE FOR THE MAIN PURPOSE OF TAKING PART IN ATHLETIC GAMES WHICH IS DEMOR ALIZING FROM EVERY VIEWPOINT THE LAWS OF THE ASSOCIATION BEARING ON THESE POINTS SHOULD BE REINFORCED BY RIGID FACULTY RULES REQUIRING FULL WORK AND A GOOD STANDARD OF SCHOLARSHIP A LIMIT TO THE TOTAL NUM BER OF YEARS A MAN MAY PLAY ON A COLLEGE TEAM BOTH AS A GRADUATE AND AN UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT IS ESSENTIAL TO HEALTHY SPORT AND HEALTHY SCHOLARSHIP THE LAW WHICH HAS AROUSED THE MOST OBJECTION AND THE VALUE OF WHICH IS LEAST UNDERSTOOD ON THE PART OF THE SUPERFICIAL STUDENT OF THE ATHLETIC QUESTION IS WHAT IS CALLED THE ONEYEAR RULE WHICH PROVIDES THAT A STUDENT WHO HAS TAKEN PART IN INTERCOLLEGIATE SPORT AT ONE INSTITUTION CANNOT PARTICIPATE ON A TEAM OF ANOTHER INSTITUTION UNTIL HE HAS BEEN A STUDENT THERE FOR ONE YEAR ALL EXPERTS AGREE THAT WITHOUT THIS LAW NO COLLEGE CAN HOPE TO HAVE PURE SPORT UNLESS THIS LAW OBTAINS SUCCESSFUL PLAYERS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY ARE A TEMPTA TION TO ALUMNI AND STUDENTS WHO ARE MORE AMBITIOUS FOR A WINNING TEAM THAN THEY ARE FOR A RECORD OF HONOR AND HONESTY AND SUCH PLAY ERS ARE CONSTANTLY TEMPTED TO ACCEPT BRIBES THE FOLLOWING EXCERPT FROM THE PUBLIC PRINTS COMMENTING ON THE PERSONNEL OF THE TEAM OF A WELLKNOWN SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY NOT A MEM BER OF THE ASSOCIATION SPEAKS FOR ITSELF AND ILLUSTRATES THIS POINT WHILE THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR OF MOST OF THE ELEVEN AT THE UNIVERSITY OF  THEY ARE THE VETERANS OF MANY BATTLES NINE OF THE TEAM HAVING PLAYED AT OTHER COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES LAST SEASON UPON INQUIRY IT WAS LEARNED THAT THREE OF THEM WERE EXCAPTAINS OF COLLEGE TEAMS ONE WAS AN EXCOACH AND ONE A PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE AND GYMNASTIC PERFORMER FROM NEW ENGLAND WHAT HONOR DOES SUCH AN AGGREGATION REFLECT UPON THE INSTITUTION WHOSE NAME IT BEARS  SUCH A TEAM PRETENDING TO BE COMPOSED OF SPORTSMEN WOULD BE HOOTED OFF AN ENGLISH ATHLETIC FIELD AND THE INSTITUTION PERMITTING ITS NAME TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH AN ORGANIZATION WOULD BE ROUNDLY CENSURED BY EVERY NEWSPAPER AND JOURNAL IN THE UNITED KINGDOM WHERE THE CODE OF ETHICS OF SPORTSMANSHIP IS ON SUCH A HIGH PLANE THAT NO GENTLEMAN NOR INSTITUTION WOULD DARE VIOLATE IT SOME TIME AGO AN ARDENT SUPPORTER OF PURE COLLEGE SPORT WROTE THAT HIS COL LEAGUES FELT SURE THAT THEY COULD KEEP THE SPORT CLEAN WITHOUT THE ONE YEAR LAW HE WAS THEREUPON PRESENTED WITH INDISPUTABLE EVIDENCE 102ATHLETIC CONTROL IN SCHOOL AND COLLEGE THAT THE STUDENTS AND ALUMNI OF HIS INSTITUTION WERE OFFERING BOARD TUITION AND INCIDENTAL EXPENSES TO WELLKNOWN PLAYERS OF OTHER COL LEGES TO INDUCE THEM TO MATRICULATE THERE AND THAT ONE OF HIS MOST PROMINENT ATHLETES WAS CONDUCTING THE NEGOTIATIONS PERSONALLY IT IS EVEN UNSAFE TO LEAVE THE CONTROL OF ATHLETICS IN THE HANDS OF AN INSTRUCTOR OR PROFESSOR OF PHYSICAL CULTURE SINCE HIS INTEREST IN HIS WORK IS LIABLE TO CAUSE HIM TO MAGNIFY IT BEYOND ITS PROPER SPHERE THIS IS WELL ILLUSTRATED BY THE FOLLOWING LETTER FROM SUCH AN OFFICER OF A LEADING NORTHERN UNIVERSITY IT WAS WRITTEN TO A FORMER STUDENT OF THE INSTITUTION MY DEAR CAN YOU NOT SEND ME THE NAMES OF SOME YOUNG MEN WHO WOULD MAKE WORTHY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNIVERSITY UPON THE BALL DIAMOND THE FOOTBALL FIELD OR IN TRACK AND FIELD SPORTS TO WHOM I COULD HAVE CIRCULARS SENT AND TO WHOM YOU COULD POSSIBLY SAY A FEW WORDS IN FAVOR OF THE U YOU KNOW THAT MEDICAL COLLEGE AND OUR NEW LAW SCHOOL ARE NOW IN OPERATION UPON THE CAMPUS FREQUENTLY EVEN WHEN A YOUNG MAN HAS DECIDED TO GO TO A PARTICULAR COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY IF THE ADVANTAGES OF CAN BE SET BEFORE HIM HE WILL CONCLUDE THAT THE OPPORTUNITIES OFFERED HIM WILL BE SUCH THAT HE WILL SEE THAT HIS FUTURE INTERESTS WILL BE BETTER SERVED BY GRADUATING FROM HERE THAN ELSEWHERE IF YOU WILL SEND ME A FEW LINES ABOUT SUCH YOUNG MEN OF PROMISE AS YOU KNOW EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT NOW READY TO ENTER TELLING ME ABOUT THEIR ABILITIES AND SUCCESSES IN ATHLETICS THEIR ADVANCEMENT IN THEIR STUDIES AND THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES I SHALL BE VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU WISHING YOU SUCCESS IN YOUR UNDERTAKINGS AND HOPING YOU CAN BE OF SOME ASSISTANCE TO US IN THIS MATTER I REMAIN ETC THIS IS A VERY SHREWD LETTER WHICH IF IT DOES NOT MEAN MORE THAN IT SAYS CAN EASILY BE MADE TO SAY MORE THAN THE WRITER MEANS NO INSTITUTION SHOULD PERMIT SUCH A LETTER TO BE SENT AND ANY MAN WHO SHOWS SO MUCH ENTERPRISE IN COLLECTING ATHLETES SHOULD NOT BE PER MITTED TO HAVE SUPERVISION OVER THEM THE INSTITUTION FROM WHICH THIS LETTER EMANATES CLAIMS TO STAND FOR PURE SPORT AND IT IS A MEMBER OF AN INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETIC ASSOCIA TION ORGANIZED TO PROMOTE SUCH SPORT BUT THE INTERPRETATION OF THE RULES RESTS WITH EACH INDIVIDUAL FACULTY THE FACULTY ATHLETIC COM MITTEE OF THE INSTITUTION PROBABLY KNOWS NOTHING OF THIS COMMUNICA TION AND PROBABLY NEVER WILL BUT AN OUTSIDE COMMITTEE WOULD NOT BE LONG IGNORANT OF IT SOME OF THE OTHER INSTITUTIONS IN THE ASSOCIATION ARE POSSIBLY FAMILIAR WITH ITS CONTENTS ALREADY BUT HESITATE TO MEN IO3THE SCHOOL REVIEW TION THE SUBJECT TO THOSE WHO ABOVE ALL OTHERS SHOULD KNOW OF IT FOR FEAR OF GIVING OFFENSE THUS THE HONOR OF THE UNIVERSITY BODY IS DIS COUNTED BY SISTER INSTITUTIONS IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR AN INSTITUTION TO BELONG TO AN ASSOCIATION AND TO SUBSCRIBE TO THE LAWS THERE MUST BE SOME ACTIVE AND VIGILANT PER SON OR COMMITTEE TO SEE THAT THE LAWS ARE THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD AND CAREFULLY OBSERVED IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO CALL TOGETHER THE CANDIDATES FOR A TEAM AND TO READ THEM THE LAWS EXPECTING ALL INELIGIBLES TO STEP ASIDE WHEN THE QUESTION IS ASKED  DOES THE RECORD OF ANY MAN CON FLICT WITH THESE LAWS ALL DO NOT GRASP THE FULL MEANING OF THE LAW AND EACH IS INCLINED TO INTERPRET IT TO SUIT HIS CASE SOME HAVE MENTAL RESERVATIONS SOME THINK THAT SILENCE IS NONCOMMITTAL AND SOME YOUNG MEN SEEM TO THINK THAT TO ACT OR TO TELL A LIE IS NOT NEARLY SO REPREHENSIBLE AS TO WRITE OR TO SWEAR TO ONE HERE IS AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY TO TEACH MORALS PRACTICALLY THE SUPERVISOR OF ATHLETICS IN A COLLEGE SHOULD REQUIRE EACH CANDIDATE TO ANSWER IN WRITING ON A BLANK PREPARED FOR THE PURPOSE ALL QUESTIONS WHICH HAVE ANY BEARING ON HIS ELIGIBILITY THESE QUESTIONS SHOULD BE SPECIFIC AND CLEAR SO THAT MISUNDERSTANDING IS IMPOSSIBLE IN CASE A MAN IS CHALLENGED OR ANY QUESTION AS TO HIS ELIGIBILITY RAISED HE SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE AFFIDAVIT THESE REQUIREMENTS IMPOSE NO HARDSHIP NEITHER DO THEY REFLECT UPON THE HONOR OF AN HONEST MAN ALTHOUGH THEY ARE SOMEWHAT ANNOYING TO THE CHEAT NO HONEST MAN OBJECTS TO MAKING OATH TO HIS STATEMENT ESPECIALLY WHEN THE LAW REQUIRES IT OF ALL UNDER SIMILAR CIR CUMSTANCES WHAT HAS BEEN SAID OF COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES APPLIES WITH EQUAL FORCE TO SCHOOLS WHERE YOUNG BOYS GET MUCH OF THE MORAL PLATFORM UPON WHICH THEY STAND THROUGHOUT LIFE EVERY SCHOOL SHOULD HAVE DEFINITE PRINCIPLES UPON WHICH ITS ATHLETICS ARE RIGIDLY CONDUCTED AND THESE PRINCIPLES SHOULD BE BASED STRICTLY ON PURE AMATEUR SPORTSMAN SHIP THEY SHOULD MUTUALLY AGREE UPON DEFINITE LAWS FOR UNIFORM GOV ERNMENT EITHER BY THE ORGANIZATION OF AN ASSOCIATION OF THEIR OWN OR BY ADOPTING THE LAWS OF SOME INTERCOLLEGIATE ASSOCIATION CONCERNING ELIGIBILITY AS THEIR GUIDE THE PRACTICE OF PLAYING TEACHERS ON SCHOOL TEAMS IS UNWHOLESOME NOT ONLY FROM THE STANDPOINT OF SPORTSMANSHIP BUT ALSO FROM A PHYSI CAL POINT OF VIEW GROWN MEN HAVE NO BUSINESS IN ATHLETIC GAMES WITH YOUNG BOYS ON ACCOUNT OF THE INCREASED LIABILITY OF INJURIES TO THE LAT TER FROM THE NECESSARILY ROUGH CONTACT WITH PLAYERS OF PHYSICAL MATU RITY IT IS UNWISE FOR THE SAME REASON TO PERMIT SCHOOL TEAMS TO 10O4ATHLETIC CONTROL IN SCHOOL AND COLLEGE ENTER INTO CONTESTS WITH COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES FOR THE DEVELOP MENT OF THE BEST SCHOOL TEAMS FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF OUTDOOR EXER CISE AMONG THE BOYS AND FOR THE PROMULGATION OF THE PROPER IDEA OF SPORTSMANSHIP SCHOOL TEAMS SHOULD BE MADE UP EXCLUSIVELY OF PUPILS AND GAMES SHOULD BE PLAYED ONLY WITH INSTITUTIONS OF THEIR OWN GRADE THE IDEA THAT BOYS HAVE INCREASED RESPECT FOR A TEACHER WHO PLAYS ON A TEAM WITH THEM IS A MISTAKEN ONE THE PUPILS WILL HAVE GREATER RESPECT FOR A MAN WHO SYMPATHIZES WITH THEM IN THEIR SPORT WHO ENCOURAGES AND DIRECTS THEM IN THEIR PLAY AND WHO GUIDES THEM KINDLY IN THE ETHICS OF GAMES FURTHERMORE THE PRINCIPAL WHO PERMITS HIS TEACHERS TO PLAY ON TEAMS OF THE SCHOOL IS ALWAYS PLACED IN THE ATTITUDE OF DEFENDING HIMSELF AGAINST THE CHARGE OF ENGAGING TEACHERS FOR THEIR ATHLETIC SERVICES RATHER THAN FOR THEIR SCHOLARSHIP AND THEN FINALLY THE PRACTICE SAVORS STRONGLY OF PROFESSIONALISM OR THAT DEMORALIZING CRAZE TO WIN AT ALL HAZARDS WHICH IS CLOSELY AKIN TO IT IT IS HOPED THAT OUR FACULTIES WILL AWAKEN TO THE URGENT NECESSITY FOR CLOSER SUPERVISION OVER ATHLETICS FOR THE SAKE OF A CAUSE WHICH IS WORTHY OF ANY MANS TIME AND ENERGY EVERY DELEGATE TO THE ASSO CIATION OF COLLEGES AND PREPARATORY SCHOOLS SHOULD GIVE THIS GREAT QUESTION SERIOUS THOUGHT AND EARNESTLY COOPERATE IN MAKING ATH LETIC SPORT A USEFUL INSTRUMENT FOR MOLDING THE CHARACTERS OF OUR YOUNG MEN SO THAT THEY MAY BETTER ENDURE ALL OF THE WORLDS TESTS FOR HONOR ABLE MANHOOD IN ORDER THAT YOU MAY BE BROUGHT INTO CLOSER TOUCH WITH THIS WORK IT IS PROPOSED TO HAVE THE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE SOUTH ERN INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION COINCIDENT WITH YOURS IN THE FUTURE I05

Appeal from a decree of the Chancery Court of the city of Richmond pronounced November 10 1897 in a suit in chancery wherein the appellees Brandt  Dunlop trustees were the complainants and the appellant and others were the defendants Affirmed The opinion states the case L L Lewis for the appellant Jackson Guy Coke  Pickerell John Dunlop and B B Munford for the appellees  Reported by M P Burks State Reporter June 98CUSSEN V BRANDT  DUNLOP BUCHANAN J delivered the opinion of the court On the 15th day of December 1892 Charles H Talbott executed a deed of trust on certain improved real estate in the city of Rich mond to secure the payment of twenty negotiable notes aggregating thirtyfive thousand eight hundred dollars 35800 drawn by Tal bott to his own order payable at the City Bank of Richmond and secured in the order of their maturity The first note was payable six months from that date and the other nineteen notes were each payable six months later than its immediate predecessor the last or twentieth note of the series being payable ten years after date The notes were afterwards for value endorsed in blank and delivered by Talbott to William A Marburg of Baltimore Md The first second and third notes were paid as they respectively matured A few days before the fourth note which was for 2690 became due Tal bott applied to Marburg to extend the time for its payment or if he was not willing to do that to assign it to some one willing to purchase it Marburg refused to sell the note but extended the time for its payment ninety days Talbott paying the interest and executing his negotiable note for a like sum payable at that time Some days before the renewal note became due it with the original note was sent by the National Union Bank of Maryland to the City Bank of Rich mond for collection The latter bank delivered the original note and as is contended by the appellant and Marburg the renewal note also to Elam either as purchaser or payer Shortly before the fifth note of the series payable thirty months after date became due it was also sent to the City Bank for collection and was delivered to Elam under substantially the same circumstances as those under which he acquired the 2690note The money which was paid by Elam was the full amount of both notes and was received by Marburg When the sixth note of the series which was payable in December 1895 became due the time for its payment was extended for four months and upon the failure of Talbott to make payment when the renewal note became due the trustees in the deed of trust were re quired to make sale of the property They filed the bill in this case to have the trust executed under the direction of the court because as they allege they learned for the first time when they were about to execute the trust that one Henry Grimmell held the twentyfour months note for 2690 having taken up the same about the time of the maturity of the ninety days re newal note and that the thirty months note was held by J B Elam 1899 99VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER who had acquired it about the time of its maturity and that they had no evidence that Marburg had assigned these notes to the parties who held them and were demanding that the property should be sold for cash sufficient to pay them Talbott and wife Marburg Grimmell and Elam were made parties defendant to the suit Elam filed his answer claiming that he had purchased the notes and afterward transferred the twentyfour months note to Grimmell and that he Elam was still the holder of the thirty months note Grimmell answered stating that he had purchased the note held by him from Elam and both asserted their right to have the property sold and the notes held by them paid in their order of priority as fixed by the deed of trust Marburg filed his answer denied that he had sold the notes as claimed byElam and Grimmell or authorized their sale and denied that those notes could be paid out of the proceeds of the trust property until the notes held by him were paid Subsequently the appellant Emilie Cussen who had a large debt secured by a subsequent deed of trust upon the same property became a party to the suit In her answer she asserted her claim under her deed of trust alleged that the notes held by Elam and Grimmell have been satisfied and were no longer liens upon the property and that she was entitled to have the trust subject sold for the payment of her debt free from the liens of these notes The matters involved in this appeal depend upon the question whether the notes in controversy were paid or purchased by the appellee Elam when he obtained them from the City Bank Elam and its cashier are the only witnesses as to what occurred when he ac quired them Elams version of what took place is as follows On the 11th of March 1895 Mr Charles Talbott came to see me at my office and stated that a note of his for 2690 was about to mature that he was unable to pay it and desired me to investigate the matter and inform him whether I could effect an extension thereof He stated what the security was giving the date of the note and said that it was one of twenty notes secured upon his two houses next to the corner of Second and Franklin streets that the original transac tion had been negotiated by Mr Jackson Brandt that the three notes prior to the said note of 2690 had been paid by him and that this note of 2690 which he wished extended was then held by the City Bank of Richmond I asked him whether this note was a prior lien 100 JuneCUSSEN V BRANDT  DUNLOP to the notes maturing subsequently under said deed he said that he did not remember but thought in any event the security was ample stat ing his estimate of the two houses and undertaking to convince me that even if it were not a prior lien there was no doubt about the security I stated to him that if the City Bank was the holder of the note and if it was a prior lien upon the property that if the notes had priority one over the other as usual that I could probably effect the extension of the note for 2690 for him provided the bank was the holder and would transfer the same by delivery and that I would in vestigate the matter and inform him of the result I then went to the office of Mr James W Sinton the cashier of the City Bank and inquired if he held the said note for 2690 naming the date and time and the amount of it stating to him that my purpose was not to pay the note but to effect an extension of it provided upon investiga tion the security was satisfactory He stated that he held the note and upon my request to look at it he went to his vault and brought me the note referred to by Mr Talbott I stated to him that I would inves tigate the security and if it were found satisfactory I would wish to take up said note for the purpose of extending it He said that would be all right and in that event I could bring my check for it I wdnt then to the clerks office of the Chancery Court and read the deed securing said notes and found that the notes were liens in the order of their maturity that they were drawn by Charles H Talbott to his own order and endorsed by him in blank and secured to the holder or holders thereof and that the property described was as represented by Mr Talbott I then went to see the client who had a day or two previously stated to me that he would have within a day or two about three thousand dollars for investment in real estate paper I stated to him that I could probably give him a note for 2690 stating to him what the security was and he consented to take it upon the receipt of the money I then took my firms check for 2690 went to the office of Mr Sinton at the City Bank stated to him that I had satisfied myself as to the security of said note about which I had spoken to him previously on the same day and that I was prepared to take up said note He brought me the note and I handed him the check Then some three months later Mr Talbott called and stated that the note for 630 which was the next note in order under said deed was very nearly due and that he was unable to pay it that he would be glad if I would effect an extension of it in the same manner as I had done the other I told him I thought I could effect an extension 1899 101VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER of that in the same manner and accordingly on the 17th of June 1895 as I now remember I went with my firms check to Mr Sin tons office and said to him that I would be willing to take up and ex tend said note for 630 if I might do so in the same manner in which I had taken up the former note for 2690 that this was one of the same series of notes secured by the same deed He said very well and went and brought me the note for 630 taking my check for the same and delivering to me the said note The cashier of the bank gives no connected account of what did occur his recollection of it seems to be very imperfect many of his statements are vague and indefinite in some instances contradictory and altogether his testimony is very unsatisfactory But in respect to the facts which are to our minds controlling in determining the character of the transaction when the bank parted with the notes the cashiers evidence tends to sustain Elams account of what occurred Elam says that when he went to the bank to enquire into the matter and to see whether or not he would take up and extend the 2690 note he told the cashier what his purpose was and that he did not wish to pay the note Upon this point the cashier says I remem ber absolutely Mr Elanms coming to me and making enquiry regard ing certain Talbott notes I do not now recall the date and my giving him what information I could and his statement that he did not wish to pay said note or notes Again when asked Do you not recall that when Mr Elam told you that his object was not to pay said note but to take it up and extend it provided he found the security satis factory upon investigation that you told him he could do so He answered I recall his stating that he wished to make certain examination before taking up said note and I stated that he could get the note When asked whether or not the 630note the other note in controversy was delivered to Elam as a paid note or as a trans ferred note he replied We regarded it as an unpaid note Elam states positively that the Baltimore banks endorsements on the notes for collection were cancelled when they were delivered to him and that when he first went to the bank he enquired if it held the 2690 note and was told that it did but he was not informed that it held it for collection When the cashier was asked whether in any of his interviews with Elam in reference to the notes he informed Elam that his bank held the notes for collection and that it had no authority to sell or transfer them he replied I have no recollection of so stating to Mr Elam 102 JuneCUSSEN V BRANDT  DUNLOP Whether a transaction like this is a payment or a purchase is a question of intention of fact rather than of law and is to be settled by the evidence Wood v Guarantee c Co 128 U S 416 It is undoubtedly true as contended by counsel for appellant that it is essential to a sale that both parties should consent to it but it is as difficult to see how there can be a payment and an extinguishment thereby of a debt by a stranger who is under no obligation to pay when there is no intention to pay as it is to see how there can be a sale without an intention to sell This assent however need not be ex pressed nor shown by direct evidence It may be inferred from the circumstances attending the transaction and often is Ketchum v Duncan 96 U S 659 It appears from the record that Elam who was neither a party to nor under any obligation to pay the notes did not intend to satisfy or discharge but to purchase them as an investment that he informed the bank of such intention that with full knowledge of his purpose to purchase for an investment and not to pay it received his money and delivered the notes to him uncancelled These facts and circum stances show that Elam intended to purchase and that the City Bank of Richmond tacitly assented to the sale Upon no other theory can its conduct in receiving Elams money and delivering the notes uncan celled with full knowledge that he intended to purchase them as an investment and not to pay them be explained The authorities hold that a transaction like that under consideration is a purchase and not a payment It was said by the Supreme Court of the United States in a case similar to this upon the question under consideration that In cases like that before us where the intention to continue the existence of the note and not to cancel it by payment is made evident when the money is paid to the collecting agent appointed to receive it and the owner of the note receives the amount due to him the authorities sustain the transaction as a purchase Dodge v The Freedmans Savings  Trust Co

was much relied on by the appellants counsel to sustain his contention that the notes must be considered as paid whilst clearly right upon the facts of that case sheds but little if any light upon this because of the material difference in the facts of the two cases In each case the 103 1899104 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER June party who had taken up the paper was a stranger to it but in that case he was by another contract expressly and primarily bound to pay it whilst in this case he was neither a party to the paper nor bound in any way for its payment When one who is primarily bound for the payment of a note takes it up it is a paymentan extinguishment of the note no matter what his intention may have been 2 Dan on Neg Inst sees 1236 1238 Citizens Bank v Lay 80 Va 440 The notes in question having been purchased by Elam they are not extinguished as appellant contends but are existing liens upon the trust subject and are entitled to priority over the deed of trust given to secure her debt The trial court so held and its decree upon that question must be affirmed Under rule IX of this court the appellees Elam and Grimmell insist that the decree appealed from is erroneous in so far as it provides that Marburg shall have priority over them and shall be first paid out of the proceeds of the trust subject and ask that the decree in that respect be corrected This contention we do not think can be sus tained The notes held by them respectively were purchased by Elam under circumstances which make it equitable that their payment should be postponed until the notes held by Marburg have been paid When Elam acquired them one note was overdue and held by the City Bank for collection It had no authority to sell them but of this Elam had no actual knowledge but he did have notice of circum stances which were sufficient to put him upon enquiry which enquiry would have disclosed the fact of the case The note for 2690 being overdue when Elam purchased it he acquired nothing but the actual right and title of the City Bank he took it subject to all the equities to which it was subject in its hands Arents v Commonwealth 18 Gratt 750 Davis v Miller 14 Gratt 1 1 Dan on Neg Insts sec 724a The other note had not yet matured but it as well as the 2690 note had upon it the restrictive endorsement of the Baltimore bank cancelled according to Elams statement but still both endorsements were legible through the pen marks by which they were cancelled These endorsements destroyed the negotiability of the notes and was notice to persons dealing with the City Bank that it held them for col lection only The cancellation of the endorsements changed the char acter of the notes and restored their negotiability This was a material change in the character of the notes apparent upon their face sufficientCUSSEN V BRANDT  DUNDOP to put Elam upon enquiry Angle v Mutual Life Ins Co 92 U S 230 1 Dan on Neg Insts 4th ed sec 795 which enquiry if pursued would have disclosed the fact that the City Bank only held the notes for collection and had no authority to sell them Elam made no such enquiry gave no notice to Marburg of his purchase allowed him to remain under the belief that the notes had been paid and that the security for the payment of other notes held by him thereby increased which latter object was no doubt the chief reason why he refused to sell the larger note before its renewal If as Elam and Grimmell contend the trust property will sell for a sum sufficient to satisfy the notes held by Marburg and themselves then no injury will result to them except a delay of two or three years in getting their money as the property by consent is to be sold for onefourth cash and the residue payable in one two and three years If on the other hand it does not sell for a sufficient sum to pay all the notes we do not think it would be equitable or just under all the circumstances of the case that Marburg should suffer loss resulting from Elams neg ligence when he purchased the notes and the delay of the holders in asserting their claim We are of opinion therefore that there is no error in the decree complained of and that it should be affirmed Affirmed NOTEWe find some difficulty in concurring in the conclusion reached by the court that Marburg has priority over Elam under the deed of trust securing the notes It seems to us that the reasoning upon which this conclusion is based is not altogether logical The court finds that the bank was Marburgs agent to collect without authority to sell the paper Of this fact Elam had no actual notice but as the court finds the endorsement on the paper for collection cancelled but still visible was sufficient to bring home to Elam want of authority in the agent to sell Hence the sale by the agent being without authority and this want of authority being known to the intending purchaser the act of the agent did not bind the principal It follows of course that no title to the paper passed to Elam And yet the court holds that Elam has title to the paper The question arises at once how does he get title The court distinctly finds that the agent was without authority to pass the title and that Elam constructively knew it and yet that the paper was not paid but purchased is still alive and is the property of Elam If again Elam has title to the paper how can he equitably be deprived of the priority of lien to which the paper is entitled by the terms of the deed of trust The title to the paper and the title to the lien securing it ought to go hand in handthe latter being a mere incident of the former If the known lack of authority in the agent does not prevent the purchaser from taking title to the paper the principal subject it is difficult to understand how it can affect the 1899 105106 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTEIR June stipulated priority of lien It seems to us that the rights of the parties would be more logically and more equitably worked out thus Elam bought from an agent who had no authority to sell He therefore got no title whatever to the paper He paid the purchase money to the agent who in turn paid it over to his principal The latter got no title to this money unless after knowledge of the facts he ratified the act of the agent After knowledge of the facts he must either ratify or repudiate the agents acts This ratification or repudiation must be in otoo A principal cannot ratify in part and repudiate in part the acts of his agent If he retain the benefits of his agents unauthorized contract after knowledge of all the facts he ipso facto ratifies the contract in its entirety and the contract is as binding as if previously authorized These principles lie at the foundation of the law of principal and agent and are too elementary to need the citation of authority They were recently enunciated and enforced by the present court in Owens v Boyd Land Co 95 Va 560 As soon therefore as Marburg learned the facts if he desired to repudiate the sale of the notes to Elam he was bound to return the latters purchase money Not having done so but having retained it he should be held to have ratified the agents contract of sale in its entirety With the contract thus ratified Elam would occupy the position of one who had purchased directly from Marburg himself and of course entitled to the stipulated priority under the deed of trust The decision of the court in substance holds Marburg to a ratification in part viz the passing of title to the paper to Elam yet permits him to repudiate in part viz the right of priority to which Elams contract of purchase entitled him The fact that Elam had constructive notice of the banks want of authority cannot possibly affect the question in this aspect The want of authority affected as well the power to transfer the paper as the lien securing it Ratification by retaining the benefits effectually cured the defect of authority all along the line If we are wrong in this conclusion that Elam on the grounds stated should have been given the priority of lien stipulated for in the deed of trust then substantially the same right might have been secured to him in another way Elam the purchaser and Marburg the owner of the notes each acted unUer a mistake of factthe fbrmer paying the money as for a purchase and the latter accepting it as for a payment The minds of the parties did not meet Under such circumstances a court of equityindeed a court of lawwill permit the transaction to be rescinded and require the repayment of the purchase money by tile one and the return of the notes by the other Upon a tender of the notes Elam might have recovered from Marburg the purchase money with interest in an action for money had and received Or a court of equitycertainly where the parties are before it on other groundswould rescind the transaction and place the parties in statu quo by requiring mutual restoration And it would be in accordance with equitable principles and practice to give to Elam the benefit of all liens held by Marburg in case this should be necessary to secure to him the repayment in full of his purchase money with interest In either of these aspects Elams lien would take priority over Marburgs

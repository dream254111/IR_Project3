OWEN,I207014, 161  VIII ON THE VERTEBRAL CHARACTERS OF THE ORDER PTEROSAURIA AS EXEMPLIED IN THE GENERA PTERODACTYLUS CUVIER AND DIMORPHODON OWEN BY PROFESSOR OWEN FBS SUPERINTENDENT OF THE NATURAL HISTORY DEPARTMENTS IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM RECEIVED FEBRUARY 23READ MARCH 24 1859 ALTHOUGH THE SKELETONS OF THE EXTINCT FLYING SAURIANS OF THE MEZOZOIC STRATA HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED IN A MORE COMPLETE CONDITION THAN THOSE OF ANY OTHER CONTEMPORARY REPTILES THEY HAVE NOT HITHERTO OWING TO THE DELICATE TEXTURE AND COMMONLY CRUSHED STATE OF THE BONES AFFORDED SATISFACTORY OBSERVATIONS OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE VERTEBRAE YET THE VERTEBRAL CHARACTERS OF A SAURIAN SKELETON ARE OF PECULIAR INTEREST TO THE PALEONTOLOGIST AND COMPARATIVE ANATOMIST ON ACCOUNT OF THE MANY AND STRONGLYMARKED DIFFERENCES WHICH THEY PRESENT IN THE EXTINCT MEMBERS OF THE REPTILIAN CLASS IN THE EXISTING SPECIES THE ARTICULAR TERMINAL SURFACES OF THE CENTRUM WITH THE EXCEP TION OF THOSE OF THE GECKOS RHYNCHOCEPHALUS  AND OF SOME SINGLE VERTEBRAE IN THE COLUMN OF OTHER REPTILEST ARE CONCAVE IN FRONT AND CONVEX BEHIND BUT IN EXTINCT REP TILES SOME GENERA STREPTOSPONDYLUS SHOW REVERSE POSITIONS OF THE CUP AND BALL OTHERS ICHTHYOSAURUS SHOW BOTH SURFACES CONCAVE OTHERS SHOW BOTH SURFACES SLIGHTLY CONCAVE TELEOSAURUS OTHERS SHOW BOTH SURFACES FLAT SOME PLESIOSAURI OTHERS ARE SUBCONCAVE BEHIND AND FLAT BEFORE CETIOSAURUS WITH MANY MINOR MODIFICATIONS IT IS ONLY ON ARRIVING AT THE UPPERMOST OF THE MEZOZOIC SERIES OF ROCKS IN AN ASCENDING SURVEY THAT WE FIND LACERTIAN GENERA MOSASAURUS AND LEIODON OF THE CHALK AND CROCODILIANS CROCODILUS BASIFISSUS FROM THE GREENSAND OF NEW JERSEY  PRESENTING THE PROCCELIAN TYPE OF VERTEBRA WHICH PREVAILS IN TERTIARY AND MODERN REPTILES NO FOSSIL VERTEBRA FROM SECONDARY ROCKS HAS COME UNDER MY OBSERVATION OR KNOW LEDGE WITH CHARACTERS OF THE ARTICULAR ENDS OF THE CENTRUM WHICH DISTINGUISH THE VERTE BRAE OF BIRDS VIZ A CONCAVITY IN ONE DIRECTION AND A CONVEXITY IN THE OTHER THE DIRECTIONS BEING REVERSED AT THE TWO ENDS OF THE CENTRUM ALL THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS HAVE TENDED TO INVEST THE QUESTION OF THE VERTEBRAL CHARACTERS OF THE PTERODACTYLES WITH PECULIAR INTEREST

ON THE VERTEBRAL TION OF THEIR REPTILIAN TYPE OF STRUCTURE FOR FLIGHT IN REFERENCE TO CARRYING OUT THE COM PARISON OF THEIR SKELETON WITH THAT OF BIRDS I HAVE THEREFORE THOUGHT THE SUMMARY OF OBSERVATIONS MIGHT NOT BE UNWORTHY THE ATTENTION OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY WHICH I HAVE MADE AS OPPORTUNITIES PRESENTED THEMSELVES FOR SOME YEARS PAST ON THE VERTEBRAL CHARACTERS OF DIFFERENT SPECIES OF THE ORDER PTEROSAURIA BEFORE ENTERING UPON SUCH SUMMARY I MAY BRIEFLY ALLUDE TO THE RECORDED OBSERVATIONS ON THE SUBJECT BARON CUVIER IN HIS CELEBRATED MEMOIR ESTABLISHING THE REPTILIAN CHARACTER OF THE ORNITHOCEPHALUS OF SOEMMERING WHICH HE THEREUPON PROPOSED TO CALL PTERODACTYLE ALMOST RESTRICTS HIMSELF TO A COMPARISON OF THE NUMBER OF THE CERVICAL AND DORSAL VERTEBRAE IN THE PTERODACTYLE AND BIRD FIVE OF THE CERVICAL VERTEBRAE OF PTERODACTYLLUS LONGIROSTRIS ARE STATED TO BE LARGE AND PRISMATIC LIKE THOSE OF LONG NECKED BIRDST WITH REGARD TO THE DORSAL VERTEBRAE THE SPINOUS PROCESSES OF THE ANTERIOR ONES ARE A LITTLE LONGER THOSE OF THE POSTERIOR ONES ARE SHORT AND CUT SQUARE THE ABLE EDITORS OF THE POSTHUMOUS EDITION OF THE  OSSEMENS FOSSILES FOUND NOTHING TO ADD IN 1836 TO THE ABOVECITED BRIEF NOTICES BY THE BARON ON THE VERTEBRAE OF THE PTERODACTYLE NOR HAS ANYTHING MATERIAL BEEN WITH CERTAINTY DETERMINED AND STATED SINCE THAT TIME THE PTERODACTYLUS SUEVICUS DESCRIBED AND FIGURED BY PROFESSOR QUENSTEDT IN 1855 WAS PERHAPS IN THE BEST CONDITION TO HAVE THROWN SOME ADDITIONAL LIGHT UPON THE SUBJECT BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT REMARK RELATES TO ONE OF THE DORSAL VERTEBRX IN WHICH THE ARTICULAR SURFACES OF THE BODY ARE CONVEX AT THE BACK END AS IN THE CROCODILE CONCAVE AT THE FORE PART AT LEAST SO IT SEEMS WRITES THE AUTHOR I IN REGARD TO THE CERVICAL VERTEBRAE THE AUTHOR SAYS THEY SEEM NOT TO HAVE THE TROCHLEAR JOINTS AS IN BIRDS YET A SMALL CAVITY MAY BE OBSERVED ON THE ARTICULAR SURFACES IF ACCORDINGLY PROFESSOR PICTET IN THE ABLE SUMMARY OF THE CHARACTERS OF EXTINCT REPTILES IN THE LAST EDITION OF HIS  PALEONTOLOGIE 8VO 1857 LIMITS HIS NOTICE OF THE VERTEBRAL CHARACTERS OF THE PTERODACTYLES TO THEIR NUMBER IN THE DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE SPINE  FROM OBSERVATIONS MADE ON SPECIES OF PTEROSAURIA EXTENDING FROM THE PERIOD OF THE LIAS AS EXEMPLIFIED BY THE DIMORPHODON MACRONYX TO THE UPPER GREENSAND AS EXEM PLIFIED BY THE PTERODACTYLUS SEDYWICKII AND

IB FIG 2  AND THAT THEY CONSEQUENTLY MANIFEST THE EARLIEST KNOWN INSTANCE OF THE PROCOELIAN TYPE WHICH NOW PREVAILS IN THE REPTILIAN CLASS BUT IN NO OTHER REPTILE ARE THOSE ARTICULAR SURFACES SO NARROW VERTICALLY IN PROPORTION TO THEIR BREADTH AS THEY ARE IN THE CERVICAL VERTEBRAE OF THE PTEROSAURIA IB FIGS 1 2 1214 B C IN THE DORSAL SERIES THE CUP AND BALL PRESENT MORE ORDINARY SAURIAN PROPORTIONS THIS FACT BEING ESTABLISHED WILL GIVE NEW AND INCREASED INTEREST TO THE WORKING OUT AND EXAMINATION OF ANY DETACHED VERTEBRAE FROM SECONDARY ROCKS WHICH RESEMBLE IN TEXTURE AND SIZE THOSE OF BIRDS AND PTERODACTYLES IT HAS BEEN ALLEGED FOR EXAMPLE ON MICROSCOPIC CHARACTERS OF THE OSSEOUS TISSUE THAT CERTAIN PNEUMATIC WINGBONES FOUND FOSSIL IN STONESFIELD SLATE ARE THOSE OF BIRDS BUT EVERY SUCH VERTEBRA FROM THAT LOWER OOLITIC BED WHICH I HAVE YET SEEN HAS THE SIMPLE TERMINAL ARTICULAR CONCAVITY OR CONVEXITY CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PTERODACTYLE A SINGLE SPECIMEN SHOWING THE INTERLOCKING JOINT I E A TRANSVERSE CONCAVITY AND VERTICAL CONVEXITY OR THE REVERSE WOULD ESTABLISH THE FACT OF THE EXISTENCE OF BIRDS DURING THE PERIOD OF DEPOSITION OF THE STRATUM CONTAINING SUCH FOSSIL VERTEBRA THERE IS BUT ONE EXCEPTION SO FAR AS I KNOW IN THE WHOLE CLASS OF BIRDS TO THE FOREGOING TYPE OF VERTEBRAL STRUCTURE THIS OCCURS IN A BIRD APTENODYTES WHICH DOES NOT FLY BUT HAS THE WINGBONES DENSE SOLID AND MODIFIED IN FORM TO SERVE THE OFFICE OF A FIN AND IS EXEMPLIFIED IN BUT A SMALL PART OF THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN IN THE THIRD TO THE EIGHTH DORSAL VERTEBRAE INCLUSIVE THE FOREPART OF THE CENTRUM IS SIMPLY CONVEX IB FIG 22 C THE HIND PART CONCAVE AND THIS PART IS CONCAVE IN THE SECOND DORSAL BUT THE FOREPART OF THIS DORSAL VERTEBRA IS CONCAVOCONVEX AS IN THE CERVICAL VERTEBRAE OF THE PENGUIN AND IN THE CERVICODORSAL VERTEBRAE OF ALL OTHER BIRDS BUT BESIDES THE REVERSE POSITIONS OF THE CUP AND BALL IN THE ABOVE DORSAL VERTEBRAE OF THE PENGUIN AS COMPARED WITH THE DORSAL VERTEBRAE OF THE PTERODACTYLE THE LATTER MIGHT BE DISTINGUISHED BY THE ABSENCE OF THE LARGE BIFURCATE HYPAPOPHYSIS IB FIG 22 HY WHICH PROJECTS FROM THE DORSAL VERTEBRAE OF THE PENGUIN THE

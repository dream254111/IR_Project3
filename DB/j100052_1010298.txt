j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1010298,Notes,i242555,BOOK DEPARTMENT NOTES A LAUDATORY CHARACTER SKETCH of Andrew Carnegie has been written by Mr Barnard Alderson1 Those wishing to know the main facts of Mr Carnegies life and to get an account of his principal benefactions will find the volume instructive The purpose of the book is evidently to increase the powerful influence which the words and deeds of Mr Carnegie are exert ing upon the people of his own generation Mr Carnegie being still actively engaged in carrying on his great educational and philanthropic work the time has not yet come for a critical biographical estimate THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS is the subject of an extensive series of translations and reprints from the best known documents on the history of Roman Catholic missions the political economic commercial and religious development of the archipelago and its early relations with European coun tries down to the beginning of the nineteenth century In their general preface the editors express the hope of casting light on the great problems which confront the American people in the Philippines and of furnishing authentic and trustworthy material for a thorough and scholarly history of the islands The undertaking is certainly a praiseworthy one and it may be wished that it will prove financially feasible Fiftyfive volumes of three hundred and twentyfive pages each are contemplated as the necessary extent of the compilation THE PLAIN FACTS AS TO THE TRUST AND THE TARIFF is a species of book of which we should have many more It was written says the author in his preface with the belief that there is no sufficient reason why sound knowledge of the trusts and the tariff should continue to be confined so nar rowly to the few Mr Bolen has accordingly undertaken to set forth the plain facts as to these two subjects in clear untechnical language The reasoning and conclusions of students and trained economists are gathered up and restated very simply forthe average untrained reader who is usually left to the instruction of politicians and campaign literature for information on such topics Not every Darwin has his Huxley and economic science is for tunate to find such a careful and wellequipped interpreter as Mr Bolen Both sides of each question are fairly presented although the author candidly avows his own beliefs and discusses the issue largely from his standpoint 1 Andrew Carnegie A Character Sketch of his Life By Barnard Alderson Pp 232 Price 140 New York Doubleday Page

Macmillan Com pany I902 452The first part dealing with the trusts begins with a description of their origin purposes and methods and the kinds of monopoly The railroad problem and municipal monopolies each come in for a separate chapter While his position on the whole is conservative Mr Bolen is not frightened by the bogie of socialism and advocates government ownership of telegraph and telephone as well as most of the municipal public service corporations if this will give the best results For railroads stricter control will be better than government ownership In general the remedies for the evils of trust monopolies endorsed by Mr Bolen are those suggested by Professor Jenks and the Industrial Commission but particularly tariff reform and the aboli tion of railway discriminations It may be that the longer an issue remains in politics the more difficult it becomes to discuss it impartially Certain it is that Mr Bolens discus sion of the tariff is not as judicial as his statement of the trust problem The hopeless unsoundness of protection is the thesis of the second part of the book and while the point of view is that of a moderate tariffreformer rather than of a rabid freetrader the treatment is more polemical than necessary The relation between protection and foreign trade and between protection and wages the arguments for protection and the future of protection in America are some of the points discussed That the tariff should be and soon will be reformed and reduced Mr Bolen does not doubt While the book is a confessed compilation the authorities consulted are thoroughly trustworthy and in his selection of material the writer has shown discrimination and care One of the most interesting and valuable features of the volume is the mass of notes and citations in the form of footnotes It is a helpful and valuable book on two of the most important topics at present engaging public attention IN HIS LOWER SOUTH Professor Brown has set forth a point of view for a true historical perspective of the interstate contest which terminated in the Civil War and in the political conflicts which have been going on south of the Mason and Dixon line since the breakdown of the antebellum regime While few essayists and historians have seen in the territorial development of interior resources the same problems and the same ideals existing in both North and South yet on questions of territorial expansion internal improvement transportation and national finance both sections have ever been of one opinion The differences as shown by Professor Brown have been in the social system based on the presence of the negro This social difference has furnished the line of cleavage Such a social factor before the war caused the South to retain slavery as a means of control and to work out distinct economic methods Since the war the problem of negro control has taken the form of the KuKlux movement and constitutional disfranchisement While under conditions of individual

today as it was before the war CATTERALLS SECOND BANK OF THE UNITED STATES is without doubt the best large piece of historical research on a single question of American finance that has yet been produced Heretofore little of reliable information has been available on the subject of banking or of private financial history Investigations and congressional reports have been partisan monographs though in many cases good have been brief when confined to a scientific exposition of data In works of wider range and scope the method has been one of reasoning from preconceived political ideas or conclusions with the result that they have been scientifically unreliable and educationally unprofit able Mr Catterall has been especially fortunate in having available the private records of the bank as well as the family correspondence and private papers of those in whose keeping the bank was placed students of history and of the country at large are fortunate in having these data collected by a trained historian and arranged and presented in a literary form that is at once fascinating and true to the subject Incidentally much light is shed on every phase of American political and social lifeas the bank was a central national figure Its activities touched every phase of American development and in fact entered largely into international relations THAT THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION was a casting off of older forms of law and of inherited institutions of social control is quite generally conceded by historians This point of view however is almost wholly lost in Cobbs Rise of Religious Liberty7 The movement toward disestablishment the forces breaking away and breaking down the old regime before the political disruption may be traced through the several colonies Mr Cobb prefers to look only on the legal forms and outward appearances of our society He thus regards the Revolution as a moving cause instead of a result of causes long before operative For the purposes of historical account the colonies are classified in four main divisions I Church of England establishments 2 Puritan establishments 3 changing establishments 4 free colonies In these four relations the changes in legal status with reference to religious disturbances are shown The book would have been better named Revo lutionary Changes in the Legal Status of the Church The scientific historian will probably

the form of a revised and completed edition From the time that Mr Davitt resigned his seat in the House of Commons his pen and tongue have been active in denunciation of the present policy of the British government While an announced and bitter partisan cannot be looked to as a basis for historic inquiry the question may also be raised as to whether any literary product coming from the other side is not to be brought under the same condemna tion Mr Davitt has something to say on the events of the war although this too is of a partisan kind When a scientific history shall be written his work together with the writings of Kruger Reitz and other Boer leaders will be found among the secondary sources of information as current litera ture on the subject All of the writings extant must be read with critical judgment That this work has been condemned by British partisans is natural All we can say is that Mr Davitt is a man worthy of respect and that he has secured much of his information on the ground and presented it in a way that is readable The book is also interesting from the number of illustrations used to give greater concreteness to the subject discussed THE POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS of modern Europe are to be successively treated in a series of condensed monographs by Etienne Flandin9 a former member of the Chamber of Deputies to be published by Le Soudier of Paris In this series two numbers have thus far appeared in the first of which English and Belgian governments are described and in the second the gov ernment of Germany The author does not attempt to present an entirely novel treatment of the various national systems but gives rather a short summary of the principal features of each government ETHICS CIVIL AND POLITICAL by David Allyn Gorton M D is not a treatise but rather a series of discussions on education labor trade indi vidualism democracy oligarchy pauperism and crime from the standpoint of ethics The author contends that mere intellectual education is insufficient for the development of moral character that in a certain sense labor is the principal means of education He also argues for the practical adoption of the results of modern investigation and study in the fields above mentioned The author insists on work for works sake and protests against the notion that wages or money equivalent is the chief end of labor THE

fourth part of the book there is a critical discussion of the present system of tariffs and trade regulation affecting the commercial exchanges between AustroHungary and the Balkan states The closing pages of the volume consider the rival interests of Austria and Hungary in this trade The volume contains a good bibliography and a large amount of wellselected information regarding the trade of southeastern Europe A NEW EDITION OF THE famous book of Sir Arthur Helps Spanish Con quest of America will be of great value to students of the history and early political administration of Spanish America The editor has conscientiously followed the lines laid down by the late author and has refrained from the running fire of adverse judgments and inapposite suggestions by which so many editors seek to build a reputation upon the ruins of the book they edit The present edition contains a large number of new notes of materials which have become available since the original appearance of the book while the older notes which in the first edition were generally printed in the original languages Spanish Latin French and Italianhave been put into English The new edition of which the fourth volume has not yet reached us is in every way an admirable book It is well printed upon good paper with excellent repro ductions of ancient maps and a large amount of useful explanatory matter in convenient form Another merit of this reprint is that it is issued at a price which will enable it to reach a far larger circle of readers than was possible for the original edition THE INSTITUT COLONIAL INTERNATIONAL has recently issued the fifth volume of its series on land laws in colonies Attention has already been called in previous numbers of THE ANNALS to the remarkably valuable work done by this institute The publications are divided into five series treating respectively of labor colonial civil service land laws protectorates and rail ways in all the principal colonial systems of the world In each volume the texts of the more important statutes are reprinted with commentaries THE FIRST NUMBER OF THE Iowa Journal of History and Politics has just appeared and contains a series of articles which gives to this new journal a position of importance amongst the periodicals in this field The journal is published under the auspices of the State Historical Society of Iowa

world a long series of publications and in this journal we have evidence of the continued energy and activity of the society THE WORK OF SIR HENRY JENKYNS on British Rule and Jurisdiction Beyond the Seas1 is in reality a treatise on colonial government As a systematic presentation of the present legal relations between the United Kingdom and the various classes of territories within which British jurisdic tion is exercised this work will probably supplant the earlier treatises of Lewis and Anson The authors intention has evidently been to present the legal framework within which the English colonial system has been worked out This plan has the merit of furnishing in compact and concise form the principles of British colonial law The great variety of plan adopted by the mother country in establishing relation with her dependencies is a tribute to the adaptability and elasticity of British political ideas But to make these various systems intelligible it is necessary to give attention to the economic situation of these dependencies and to their commercial relations with the mother country The numerous changes in the form of government of the British West Indies are only intelligible when explained by the peculiar economic and racial conditions obtaining in the archipelago The failure to treat the economic and racial phases of colonial relations gives to the work a formal character which increases its value as a work of reference but does not make it a safe guide in the study of colonial affairs The authors long experience as assistant parliamentary counsel has given him a mastery of detail together with a precision of formulation which gives to the work the character of a vade mecum to the student of colonial law The authors death before the work had been subjected to final revision accounts for the incompleteness of certain portions THE CAUSE OF GEOGRAPHY is materially advanced by the house of Stanford in the new issue of the Compendium of Geography

of Latin America in the last two decades by Whymper Conway Fitz gerald Crevane Thonar im Thurn Rodway Ehrenreich von den Steinen Reiss Church Stiibel Ball Brigham Hill Romero Thompson Seler and many other distinguished geographers archaeologists naturalists or anthro pologists These contributions have revolutionized our earlier notions as to the geological history of Central and South America the orographic systems of the West Indies and the distribution of plants and animals over the whole area Many problems of racial affinity have been solved so that a much more complete and scientific statement is here given of the geography of a continent than was possible a few years ago The treatment is full and authentic the maps are of large scale ample detail and fine quality and the many illustrations though well chosen are inferior to what we are accustomed to in American publications It is a valuable book and will commend itself to a wide circle of intelligent readers LE MONDE POLYNESIEN16 gives in interesting and readable form the experiences of the explorer Henri Mager during a considerable time spent in Egypt India and the islands of the Pacific The author made a circle of the globe largely for the purpose of comparing the different methods of colonial administration and studying the ethnology of the Polynesian Islands He controverts the hypothesis that these islands originally were a great continent now submerged shows that they were formed by the action of subterranean eruptions supplemented by a growth of coral reefs and con cludes that the Polynesian races are related to the Malaysian and the Mal gaches the three branches of this ethnic current coming originally from Asia The book also contains some interesting observations concerning the great statues on the island of Paques From the colonial point of view M Mager traces a parallel between the Polynesian sections colonized by the English the Germans and the Americans on the one hand and the districts thus far colonized by France The author has no sympathy for the French policy which has resulted in the gradual dismemberment of the national empire nor with the methods which have resulted in such lamentable failure to exploit the natural advantages of the colonies The book concludes with a short historical summary of the earliest Pacific explorations THE CURRENT OBJECTION of overspecialization of interests cannot be leveled at Mr William Justin Mann if one may judge from his little volume of 300 pages originally presented to the public as popular lectures17 The authorlecturer selects I492

the manysided progress of the modem European and American world If the reader finds the book uncrit ical and chaotic he should endeavor to comfort himself with the Hegelian con victionwhich is the authors apology for his lecturesthat there is asaving unity somewhere p 7 The book ought to prove pleasant reading for those who have the popularlecture habit18 BELIEVING THAT AMERICAN shipping is soon to increase rapidly in ton nage Mr Winthrop L Marvin has written a volume on the history and romance of our merchant navy1 It is the declared purpose of this volume to present both the romance and the history of the American merchant marine The volume is a careful and thorough piece of work and gives evidence of wide reading on the part of the author The book however will hardly be satisfactory to the student of American shipping A full and ade quate history of our merchant marine from I620 to I902 cannot be covered in a single volume but it is not probable that Mr Marvin regards his book as a complete history The plan of mingling romance with history is a dan gerous one that is almost certain to vitiate the history and to mar the literary merits of the romance The author would have done better to have con fined himself to one or the other phase of his theme On the question of sub sidies the authors views are not extreme He believes that the United States ought not to have withdrawn its support to shipping in 1858 but thinks that No legislation however liberal or however strenuous could have caused American shipping to spread and increase between 1865 and I890 It is not surprising that Mr Marvins study leads him to conclude that economic conditions are quietly shaping themselves now that will cause a large growth in the amount of American capital in ocean shipping The International Mercantile Marine Company was being organized as the author was com pleting his book The success of the German policy of aiding shipping has also impressed Mr Marvin strongly and he believes that What the empire has done the republic can do more readily if it will This conclusion would seem warranted provided the American government will go about the matter in the same systematic and businesslike way that Germany has done but such a course does not seem probable COLONEL ALEXANDER K MCCLURES Recollections of Half a Century must be judged from what the book

McClure has done is to give us racy and journal istic accounts of events in the last half century with which he has in the majority of cases been but remotely concerned and then in no important capacity His very ability as a journalist vitiates his work as an historian One soon gets the impression that he is relying too much on hearsay There is a moral certainty that he has not gone back of mere popular accounts or personal recollection for the purpose of establishing his facts Where Colonel McClure has personally taken an intimate part in an historic event he has something to tell us that might have historic value but for the fact that such contributions are usually mere interesting episodes rather than important historical events LINDE DAUJOURDHUI21 is an interesting description of the impressions of a French traveler who has completed an extensive tour of India M Metin has described the social conditions in the largest sense of the word He dwells on the religious sentiment of the Hindoos the spirit of English administration and the development of a sort of opposition party which has arisen among the educated classes Some space is also devoted to the history and present conditions of Indian agriculture and other industries In con trasting English and French methods of colonial administration in India the author declares that British public opinion has very largely lost its sym pathetic point of view towards the natives The book gives a fair and impar tial though necessarily somewhat hasty review of Indian conditions RAILWAYS IN TROPICAL AFRICA is the subject of an interesting economic study by Professor Hans Meyer of the Bibliographical Institute of Leipzig Professor Meyer describes the great railway systems which have with aston ishing rapidity arisen throughout the European colonies in Africa The three great colonial powers including England France and Germany have made enormous outlays of capital within recent years to develop an extensive system of internal communications and although it is as yet too early to fore cast the financial results of these enterprises it may be prophesied that con siderable military expenditures will probably be saved to the powers inter ested The author describes first the Upper Guinea and Niger Basin with the English French and German lines there constructed He then takes up the valley of the Congo and the enterprises started by the Congo Free State and the French Congo Colony in Southwest Africa The important German line between SwakopmundWindhoek is discussed a similar treatment being given to railways in Rhodesia in Nyassa and Tanganyika in the Victoria district and the Middle Nile and Abyssinia and finally the insular systems of Madagascar Reunion and Mauritius The monograph contains a number of conclusions concerning the cost of construction methods of opera 2l By Albert MWtin Pp 304 Price 350 fr Paris Armand Colin 1903 2 Eisenbahnen im tropischen Afrika Pp x86 and map Leipzig

constructed by the home governments as the French Soudan Railway the Egyptian Soudan Railway the Uganda the Southwest African and the Usambara Most of the railways however have been built by the colonies themselves although France has adopted a policy of granting concessions to private companies IN THEORY AND PRACTICEs OF THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT Professor Moran has satisfactorily solved the principal difficulty confronting every author who attempts to give a brief description of the British system he has combined an excellent summary of the more important and generally known features of English institutions with the less familiar and more obscure practices of the government Modem writers are no longer content to discuss the mere formal aspects of a political system Such treatises exist in scores and are capable of indefinite multiplication without adding anything to the real knowledge of the subject What is needed as a textbook for colleges is precisely what the author has here given We want to know how the government is run how the principle of ministerial responsibility works in practice how the individual member of Parliament comports himr self during sessions how the House of Commons conducts its business what the practical working of the House of Lords is All of these things and many more are described in Professor Morans book and after a perusal of it the reader feels that he has been introduced to the principal members of the government and talked with them about public business It is unfortu nate that Professor Moran has not included in his book the recently amended rules of procedure for the House of Commons A RECENT CONTRIBUTION TO the study and teaching of commercial and economic geography is a HandelsAtlas by A Scobel This is a collection of

Extension lectures which Mr Wishart gave under the auspices of the University of Chicago REVIEWS The Social Unrest By JOHN GRAHAM BROOKS PP 394 Price SI50 New York Macmillan Company I903 For many years the author of The Social Unrest Mr John Graham Brooks has been a close student of the social movements in America and Europe During these years he has come into contact with large numbers of employers and laborers and has secured a mass of firsthand testimony much of which is effectively presented in the present volume In this Mr Brooks attempts to do for a larger circle what he has so successfully accom plished in his lectures to press home the fact that there is a social problem and to emphasize the responsibility of the public for the proper solution of the difficulties The book is scarcely to be considered a carefully planned thesis logically developed In fact it is difficult to trace the thread of the argument It is a product not of the study but shaped in the Sturm und Drang of economic activity One seems to see as in a vast kaleidoscope the social elements in motion forming new and wonderful combinations with bewildering rapidity element warring against element for dominant position in the picture The centre of the trouble is found in the relations of labor organizations to trusts and the tendency to seek economic ends by political means In this the capitalists supposedly opposed to paternalism have led the way The struggles have quickened the pace of socialism The danger is in the possi bility of class conflict There is no danger in socialism that for a moment compares with that part of its working propaganda dear to extremiststhe class struggle To make men believe in the fatalities of this social warfare is the deadliest work in which any human being can engage That this feeling of class is not the result of disordered imagination among laborers is recognized This stunting use of the child in industry is but a part of what 26 A Short History

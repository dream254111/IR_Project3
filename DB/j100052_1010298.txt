ALDERSON1 THOSE WISHING TO KNOW THE MAIN FACTS OF MR CARNEGIES LIFE AND TO GET AN ACCOUNT OF HIS PRINCIPAL BENEFACTIONS WILL FIND THE VOLUME INSTRUCTIVE THE PURPOSE OF THE BOOK IS EVIDENTLY TO INCREASE THE POWERFUL INFLUENCE WHICH THE WORDS AND DEEDS OF MR CARNEGIE ARE EXERT ING UPON THE PEOPLE OF HIS OWN GENERATION MR CARNEGIE BEING STILL ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN CARRYING ON HIS GREAT EDUCATIONAL AND PHILANTHROPIC WORK THE TIME HAS NOT YET COME FOR A CRITICAL BIOGRAPHICAL ESTIMATE THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS IS THE SUBJECT OF AN EXTENSIVE SERIES OF TRANSLATIONS AND REPRINTS FROM THE BEST KNOWN DOCUMENTS ON THE HISTORY OF ROMAN CATHOLIC MISSIONS THE POLITICAL ECONOMIC COMMERCIAL AND RELIGIOUS DEVELOPMENT OF THE ARCHIPELAGO AND ITS EARLY RELATIONS WITH EUROPEAN COUN TRIES DOWN TO THE BEGINNING OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IN THEIR GENERAL PREFACE THE EDITORS EXPRESS THE HOPE OF CASTING LIGHT ON THE GREAT PROBLEMS WHICH CONFRONT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN THE PHILIPPINES AND OF FURNISHING AUTHENTIC AND TRUSTWORTHY MATERIAL FOR A THOROUGH AND SCHOLARLY HISTORY OF THE ISLANDS THE UNDERTAKING IS CERTAINLY A PRAISEWORTHY ONE AND IT MAY BE WISHED THAT IT WILL PROVE FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE FIFTYFIVE VOLUMES OF THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTYFIVE PAGES EACH ARE CONTEMPLATED AS THE NECESSARY EXTENT OF THE COMPILATION THE PLAIN FACTS AS TO THE TRUST AND THE TARIFF IS A SPECIES OF BOOK OF WHICH WE SHOULD HAVE MANY MORE IT WAS WRITTEN SAYS THE AUTHOR IN HIS PREFACE WITH THE BELIEF THAT THERE IS NO SUFFICIENT REASON WHY SOUND KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUSTS AND THE TARIFF SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE CONFINED SO NAR ROWLY TO THE FEW MR BOLEN HAS ACCORDINGLY UNDERTAKEN TO SET FORTH THE PLAIN FACTS AS TO THESE TWO SUBJECTS IN CLEAR UNTECHNICAL LANGUAGE THE REASONING AND CONCLUSIONS OF STUDENTS AND TRAINED ECONOMISTS ARE GATHERED UP AND RESTATED VERY SIMPLY FORTHE AVERAGE UNTRAINED READER WHO IS USUALLY LEFT TO THE INSTRUCTION OF POLITICIANS AND CAMPAIGN LITERATURE FOR INFORMATION ON SUCH TOPICS NOT EVERY DARWIN HAS HIS HUXLEY AND ECONOMIC SCIENCE IS FOR TUNATE TO FIND SUCH A CAREFUL AND WELLEQUIPPED INTERPRETER AS MR BOLEN BOTH SIDES OF EACH QUESTION ARE FAIRLY PRESENTED ALTHOUGH THE AUTHOR

MACMILLAN COM PANY I902 452THE FIRST PART DEALING WITH THE TRUSTS BEGINS WITH A DESCRIPTION OF THEIR ORIGIN PURPOSES AND METHODS AND THE KINDS OF MONOPOLY THE RAILROAD PROBLEM AND MUNICIPAL MONOPOLIES EACH COME IN FOR A SEPARATE CHAPTER WHILE HIS POSITION ON THE WHOLE IS CONSERVATIVE MR BOLEN IS NOT FRIGHTENED BY THE BOGIE OF SOCIALISM AND ADVOCATES GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP OF TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE AS WELL AS MOST OF THE MUNICIPAL PUBLIC SERVICE CORPORATIONS IF THIS WILL GIVE THE BEST RESULTS FOR RAILROADS STRICTER CONTROL WILL BE BETTER THAN GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP IN GENERAL THE REMEDIES FOR THE EVILS OF TRUST MONOPOLIES ENDORSED BY MR BOLEN ARE THOSE SUGGESTED BY PROFESSOR JENKS AND THE INDUSTRIAL COMMISSION BUT PARTICULARLY TARIFF REFORM AND THE ABOLI TION OF RAILWAY DISCRIMINATIONS IT MAY BE THAT THE LONGER AN ISSUE REMAINS IN POLITICS THE MORE DIFFICULT IT BECOMES TO DISCUSS IT IMPARTIALLY CERTAIN IT IS THAT MR BOLENS DISCUS SION OF THE TARIFF IS NOT AS JUDICIAL AS HIS STATEMENT OF THE TRUST PROBLEM THE HOPELESS UNSOUNDNESS OF PROTECTION IS THE THESIS OF THE SECOND PART OF THE BOOK AND WHILE THE POINT OF VIEW IS THAT OF A MODERATE TARIFFREFORMER RATHER THAN OF A RABID FREETRADER THE TREATMENT IS MORE POLEMICAL THAN NECESSARY THE RELATION BETWEEN PROTECTION AND FOREIGN TRADE AND BETWEEN PROTECTION AND WAGES THE ARGUMENTS FOR PROTECTION AND THE FUTURE OF PROTECTION IN AMERICA ARE SOME OF THE POINTS DISCUSSED THAT THE TARIFF SHOULD BE AND SOON WILL BE REFORMED AND REDUCED MR BOLEN DOES NOT DOUBT WHILE THE BOOK IS A CONFESSED COMPILATION THE AUTHORITIES CONSULTED ARE THOROUGHLY TRUSTWORTHY AND IN HIS SELECTION OF MATERIAL THE WRITER HAS SHOWN DISCRIMINATION AND CARE ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING AND VALUABLE FEATURES OF THE VOLUME IS THE MASS OF NOTES AND CITATIONS IN THE FORM OF FOOTNOTES IT IS A HELPFUL AND VALUABLE BOOK ON TWO OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TOPICS AT PRESENT ENGAGING PUBLIC ATTENTION IN HIS LOWER SOUTH PROFESSOR BROWN HAS SET FORTH A POINT OF VIEW FOR A TRUE HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE OF THE INTERSTATE CONTEST WHICH TERMINATED IN THE CIVIL WAR AND IN THE POLITICAL CONFLICTS WHICH HAVE BEEN GOING ON SOUTH OF THE MASON AND DIXON LINE SINCE THE BREAKDOWN OF THE ANTEBELLUM REGIME WHILE FEW ESSAYISTS AND HISTORIANS HAVE SEEN IN THE TERRITORIAL DEVELOPMENT OF INTERIOR RESOURCES THE SAME PROBLEMS AND THE SAME IDEALS EXISTING IN BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH YET ON QUESTIONS OF TERRITORIAL EXPANSION INTERNAL IMPROVEMENT TRANSPORTATION AND NATIONAL FINANCE BOTH SECTIONS HAVE EVER BEEN OF ONE OPINION THE DIFFERENCES AS SHOWN BY PROFESSOR BROWN HAVE BEEN IN THE SOCIAL SYSTEM BASED ON THE PRESENCE OF THE NEGRO THIS SOCIAL DIFFERENCE HAS FURNISHED THE LINE OF CLEAVAGE SUCH A SOCIAL FACTOR BEFORE THE WAR CAUSED THE SOUTH TO RETAIN SLAVERY AS A MEANS OF CONTROL AND TO WORK OUT DISTINCT ECONOMIC METHODS SINCE THE WAR THE PROBLEM OF NEGRO CONTROL HAS TAKEN THE FORM OF THE KUKLUX MOVEMENT AND CONSTITUTIONAL DISFRANCHISEMENT WHILE UNDER CONDITIONS OF INDIVIDUAL

PRODUCED HERETOFORE LITTLE OF RELIABLE INFORMATION HAS BEEN AVAILABLE ON THE SUBJECT OF BANKING OR OF PRIVATE FINANCIAL HISTORY INVESTIGATIONS AND CONGRESSIONAL REPORTS HAVE BEEN PARTISAN MONOGRAPHS THOUGH IN MANY CASES GOOD HAVE BEEN BRIEF WHEN CONFINED TO A SCIENTIFIC EXPOSITION OF DATA IN WORKS OF WIDER RANGE AND SCOPE THE METHOD HAS BEEN ONE OF REASONING FROM PRECONCEIVED POLITICAL IDEAS OR CONCLUSIONS WITH THE RESULT THAT THEY HAVE BEEN SCIENTIFICALLY UNRELIABLE AND EDUCATIONALLY UNPROFIT ABLE MR CATTERALL HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY FORTUNATE IN HAVING AVAILABLE THE PRIVATE RECORDS OF THE BANK AS WELL AS THE FAMILY CORRESPONDENCE AND PRIVATE PAPERS OF THOSE IN WHOSE KEEPING THE BANK WAS PLACED STUDENTS OF HISTORY AND OF THE COUNTRY AT LARGE ARE FORTUNATE IN HAVING THESE DATA COLLECTED BY A TRAINED HISTORIAN AND ARRANGED AND PRESENTED IN A LITERARY FORM THAT IS AT ONCE FASCINATING AND TRUE TO THE SUBJECT INCIDENTALLY MUCH LIGHT IS SHED ON EVERY PHASE OF AMERICAN POLITICAL AND SOCIAL LIFEAS THE BANK WAS A CENTRAL NATIONAL FIGURE ITS ACTIVITIES TOUCHED EVERY PHASE OF AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT AND IN FACT ENTERED LARGELY INTO INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS THAT THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION WAS A

LOOK ONLY ON THE LEGAL FORMS AND OUTWARD APPEARANCES OF OUR SOCIETY HE THUS REGARDS THE REVOLUTION AS A MOVING CAUSE INSTEAD OF A RESULT OF CAUSES LONG BEFORE OPERATIVE FOR THE PURPOSES OF HISTORICAL ACCOUNT THE COLONIES ARE CLASSIFIED IN FOUR MAIN DIVISIONS I CHURCH OF ENGLAND ESTABLISHMENTS 2 PURITAN ESTABLISHMENTS 3 CHANGING ESTABLISHMENTS 4 FREE COLONIES IN THESE FOUR RELATIONS THE CHANGES IN

THE FORM OF A REVISED AND COMPLETED EDITION FROM THE TIME THAT MR DAVITT RESIGNED HIS SEAT IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS HIS PEN AND TONGUE HAVE BEEN ACTIVE IN DENUNCIATION OF THE PRESENT POLICY OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT WHILE AN ANNOUNCED AND BITTER PARTISAN CANNOT BE LOOKED TO AS A BASIS FOR HISTORIC INQUIRY THE QUESTION MAY ALSO BE RAISED AS TO WHETHER ANY LITERARY PRODUCT COMING FROM THE OTHER SIDE IS NOT TO BE BROUGHT UNDER THE SAME CONDEMNA TION MR DAVITT HAS SOMETHING TO SAY ON THE EVENTS OF THE WAR ALTHOUGH THIS TOO IS OF A PARTISAN KIND WHEN A SCIENTIFIC HISTORY SHALL BE WRITTEN HIS WORK TOGETHER WITH THE WRITINGS OF KRUGER REITZ AND OTHER BOER LEADERS WILL BE FOUND AMONG THE SECONDARY SOURCES OF INFORMATION AS CURRENT LITERA TURE ON THE SUBJECT ALL OF THE WRITINGS EXTANT MUST BE READ WITH CRITICAL JUDGMENT THAT THIS WORK HAS BEEN CONDEMNED BY BRITISH PARTISANS IS NATURAL ALL WE CAN SAY IS THAT MR DAVITT IS A MAN WORTHY OF RESPECT AND THAT HE HAS SECURED MUCH OF HIS INFORMATION ON THE GROUND AND PRESENTED IT IN A WAY THAT IS READABLE THE BOOK IS ALSO INTERESTING FROM THE NUMBER OF ILLUSTRATIONS USED TO GIVE GREATER CONCRETENESS TO THE SUBJECT DISCUSSED THE

OF MODERN INVESTIGATION AND STUDY IN THE FIELDS ABOVE MENTIONED THE AUTHOR INSISTS ON WORK FOR WORKS SAKE AND PROTESTS AGAINST THE NOTION THAT WAGES OR MONEY EQUIVALENT IS THE CHIEF END OF LABOR THE

SEAS1 IS IN REALITY A TREATISE ON COLONIAL GOVERNMENT AS A SYSTEMATIC PRESENTATION OF THE PRESENT LEGAL RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE VARIOUS CLASSES OF TERRITORIES WITHIN WHICH BRITISH JURISDIC TION IS EXERCISED THIS WORK WILL PROBABLY SUPPLANT THE EARLIER TREATISES OF LEWIS AND ANSON THE AUTHORS INTENTION HAS EVIDENTLY BEEN TO PRESENT THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH THE ENGLISH COLONIAL SYSTEM HAS BEEN WORKED OUT THIS PLAN HAS THE MERIT OF FURNISHING IN COMPACT AND CONCISE FORM THE PRINCIPLES OF BRITISH COLONIAL LAW THE GREAT VARIETY OF PLAN ADOPTED BY THE MOTHER COUNTRY IN ESTABLISHING RELATION WITH HER DEPENDENCIES IS A TRIBUTE TO THE ADAPTABILITY AND ELASTICITY OF BRITISH POLITICAL IDEAS BUT TO MAKE THESE VARIOUS SYSTEMS INTELLIGIBLE IT IS NECESSARY TO GIVE ATTENTION TO THE ECONOMIC SITUATION OF THESE DEPENDENCIES AND TO THEIR COMMERCIAL RELATIONS WITH THE MOTHER COUNTRY THE NUMEROUS CHANGES IN THE FORM OF GOVERNMENT OF THE BRITISH WEST INDIES ARE ONLY INTELLIGIBLE WHEN EXPLAINED BY THE PECULIAR ECONOMIC AND RACIAL CONDITIONS OBTAINING IN THE ARCHIPELAGO THE FAILURE TO TREAT THE ECONOMIC AND RACIAL PHASES OF COLONIAL RELATIONS GIVES TO THE WORK A FORMAL CHARACTER WHICH INCREASES ITS VALUE AS A WORK OF REFERENCE BUT DOES NOT MAKE IT A SAFE GUIDE IN THE STUDY OF COLONIAL AFFAIRS THE AUTHORS LONG EXPERIENCE AS ASSISTANT PARLIAMENTARY COUNSEL HAS GIVEN HIM A MASTERY OF DETAIL TOGETHER WITH A PRECISION OF FORMULATION WHICH GIVES TO THE WORK THE CHARACTER OF A VADE MECUM TO THE STUDENT OF COLONIAL LAW THE AUTHORS DEATH BEFORE THE WORK HAD BEEN

POLYNESIEN16 GIVES IN INTERESTING AND READABLE FORM THE EXPERIENCES OF THE EXPLORER HENRI MAGER DURING A CONSIDERABLE TIME SPENT IN EGYPT INDIA AND THE ISLANDS OF THE PACIFIC THE AUTHOR MADE A CIRCLE OF THE GLOBE LARGELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF COMPARING THE DIFFERENT METHODS OF COLONIAL ADMINISTRATION AND STUDYING THE ETHNOLOGY OF THE POLYNESIAN ISLANDS HE CONTROVERTS THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THESE ISLANDS ORIGINALLY WERE A GREAT CONTINENT NOW SUBMERGED SHOWS THAT THEY WERE FORMED BY THE ACTION OF SUBTERRANEAN ERUPTIONS SUPPLEMENTED BY A GROWTH OF CORAL REEFS AND CON CLUDES THAT THE POLYNESIAN RACES ARE RELATED TO THE MALAYSIAN AND THE MAL GACHES THE THREE BRANCHES OF THIS ETHNIC CURRENT COMING ORIGINALLY FROM ASIA THE BOOK ALSO CONTAINS SOME INTERESTING OBSERVATIONS CONCERNING THE GREAT STATUES ON THE ISLAND OF PAQUES FROM THE COLONIAL POINT OF VIEW M MAGER TRACES A PARALLEL BETWEEN THE POLYNESIAN SECTIONS COLONIZED BY THE ENGLISH THE GERMANS AND THE AMERICANS ON THE ONE HAND AND THE DISTRICTS THUS FAR COLONIZED BY FRANCE THE AUTHOR HAS NO SYMPATHY FOR THE FRENCH POLICY WHICH HAS RESULTED IN THE GRADUAL DISMEMBERMENT OF THE NATIONAL EMPIRE NOR WITH THE METHODS WHICH HAVE RESULTED IN SUCH

AND THE HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN MERCHANT MARINE THE VOLUME IS A CAREFUL AND THOROUGH PIECE OF WORK AND GIVES EVIDENCE OF WIDE READING ON THE PART OF THE AUTHOR THE BOOK HOWEVER WILL HARDLY BE SATISFACTORY TO THE STUDENT OF AMERICAN SHIPPING A FULL AND ADE QUATE HISTORY OF OUR MERCHANT MARINE FROM I620 TO I902 CANNOT BE COVERED IN A SINGLE VOLUME BUT IT IS NOT PROBABLE THAT MR MARVIN REGARDS HIS BOOK AS A COMPLETE HISTORY THE PLAN OF MINGLING ROMANCE WITH HISTORY IS A DAN GEROUS ONE THAT IS ALMOST CERTAIN TO VITIATE THE HISTORY AND TO MAR THE LITERARY MERITS OF THE ROMANCE THE AUTHOR WOULD HAVE DONE BETTER TO HAVE CON FINED HIMSELF TO ONE OR THE OTHER PHASE OF HIS THEME ON THE QUESTION OF SUB SIDIES THE AUTHORS VIEWS ARE NOT EXTREME HE BELIEVES THAT THE UNITED STATES OUGHT NOT TO HAVE WITHDRAWN ITS SUPPORT TO SHIPPING IN 1858 BUT THINKS THAT NO LEGISLATION HOWEVER LIBERAL OR HOWEVER STRENUOUS COULD HAVE CAUSED AMERICAN SHIPPING TO SPREAD AND INCREASE BETWEEN 1865 AND I890 IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT MR MARVINS STUDY LEADS HIM TO CONCLUDE THAT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ARE QUIETLY SHAPING THEMSELVES NOW THAT WILL CAUSE A LARGE GROWTH IN THE AMOUNT OF AMERICAN CAPITAL IN OCEAN SHIPPING THE INTERNATIONAL MERCANTILE MARINE COMPANY WAS BEING ORGANIZED AS THE AUTHOR WAS COM PLETING HIS BOOK THE SUCCESS OF THE GERMAN POLICY OF AIDING SHIPPING HAS ALSO IMPRESSED MR MARVIN STRONGLY AND HE BELIEVES THAT WHAT THE EMPIRE HAS DONE THE REPUBLIC CAN DO MORE READILY IF IT WILL THIS CONCLUSION WOULD SEEM WARRANTED PROVIDED THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT WILL GO ABOUT THE MATTER IN THE

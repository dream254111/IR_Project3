j101009,The Virginia Law Register,1100167,What Is the Jurisdictional Amount of the Court of Appeals of Virginia in Matters Merely Pecuniary,i245912,WHAT IS THE JURISDICTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE COURT OF APPEALS OF VIR GINIA IN MATTERS MERELY PECUNIARY It has been generally assumed by the profession that since the new Con stitution went into effect the jurisdictional amount of the Court of Appeals has been reduced from 500 to 300 and this has been taught as the law in one at least of the law schools of the State But is it a fact that the amount necessary for appeal is now only 300 A careful reading of section 88 Art 6 of the new Constitution will reveai several almost insuperable obstacles to the maintenance of this view This section after conferring original jurisdiction in habeas corpus manda mus and prohibition cases and appellate jurisdiction in cases involving the constitutionality of a law and cases involving life and liberty provides that it shall also have appellate jurisdiction in such other cases within the limits hereinafter defined as nzay be prescribed by law Now what are the limits The court shall not have jurisdiction in civil cases where the matter in controversy exclusive of costs etc    is less in value or amount than 300 It does not say that the court shall have jurisdiction where the amount in controversy is 300 but 300 is the limit hereinafter defined within which the court has jurisdiction as prescribed by law The legislature has prescribed 500 as the amount from which an appeal will lie This is the amount prescribed by law until the General Assembly sees fit to change it But when can the General Assembly change it After the year 1910 the General Assembly may change the jurisdiction of the court in matters purely pecuniary Thus it would seem that not only is the amount fixed at 500 but it is impossible for the legislature to change it prior to 1910 The intention of the Convention in inserting these provisions was that 300 should be the amount from which an appeal would lie in matters purely pecuniary and that this should remain the jurisdictional amount until 1910 when the General Assembly might raise it if practical experience demon strated that 300 was too small and the court became congested with this class of cases The journal of the Convention does not throw any light on the matter as the section involved was passed without discussion by the body as a whole It seems clear this provision is not selfexecuting because its express lan guage requires legislative action to give it effect It says in such other578 9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Oct cases as may be prescribed by law Hence it is not necessary to consider the great mass of learning on the question of constitutional provisions which are selfexecuting and those which are not OLIvER B HARVEY September 15 1903 NOTEThe question as to whether the section of the Constitution of 1902 alluded to is or is not selfexecuting is one upon which some differ ence of opinion exists in the profession As we understand Mr Harvey he contends that the minimum jurisdiction in matters merely pecuniary is now 500 and must so remain until 1910 and that after that year the General Assembly may make any change in that respect it may desire We consider this an extreme view The insuperable difficulty in the way of such a con struction is that it renders absolutely meaningless and nugatory the pro vision that the Supreme Court shall not have jurisdiction in matter merely pecuniary where the amount involved is less than 300 We understand that the Committee on Code Revision of the present General Assembly will present at the approaching November session a bill fixing the pecuniary limit of the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals at three hundred dollars and making the statute retroactive in its operation We also understand that thus far no petition for appeal or writ of error in a case involving less than 500 has been presented to the Court of Appeals and therefore that court will probably not be called to pass upon the questionEDITOR VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER

NUMBER I84 THE TEACHING OF GERMAN LITERATURE IN HIGH SCHOOLS AND ACADEMIES STARR WILLARD CUTTING The University of Chicago To study literature even in an elementary fashion presup poses of course the ability to read and understand the lan guage in question We teachers have sinned much against this axiomatic principle by premature efforts to teach German litera ture to pupils signally deficient in knowledge of the German language We have robbed the learner of the time needed to prepare himself for doing what we have insisted upon his doing at the outset The result has always been waning interest and increasing discouragement on the part of the serious student who has felt instinctively the hopelessness of his task and com placent pride and selfsatisfaction in the shallow student who confuses his superficial work with real mastery of the subject In a large and very general sense of the word it is quite true that any and all study of a language is a simultaneous study of the national literature this for the simple reason that the idiomatic structure of the sentence is at once a phenomenon of language and of literature But for the purpose of this paper we may understand by the term literature those forms of art that appeal to us through language as their common means of expression These forms are of course unintelligible for him who is ignorant of the means of their manifestation Until the 217THE SCHOOL REVIEW pupil has actually mastered the mechanism of inflection the usual laws of wordorder the habitual caseassociations and rela tional meanings of all common prepositions the idiomatic shades of meaning conveyed by such particles as denn doch eben erst einmal ja and wohl and by the modal auxiliaries and sub junctive mood it is precious time wasted to trouble him with socalled study of German literature For it is a careless use of an otherwise respectable term to call the blind gropings of a learner not thus preliminarily trained translation of German into English Such upsettings of one language into another are synonymous with linguistic chaos and caricature the literary form of the original They render impossible an appreciation of this form and incidentally teach a fatal disregard of and disrespect for all linguistic tradition It would be far better for all concerned to refrain from such attempts to study German literature directly and to study it indirectly with the help of the best available vernacular translations Fortunately we are not confined to these embarrassing alternatives to avoid them we need simply to teach the language conscientiously and thor oughly focusing attention constantly upon its idiomatic struc ture and to defer the study of the literature until an adequate foundation has been laid for it This means in my opinion that two full years of prevailingly linguistic training should be the normal preparation for the study of German literature in the high school And it also means that these years should be filled to the brim with a type of instruction that calls for much oral drill inside and outside the classroom I know of no other means than this to impress indelibly upon the learners mind the idiomatic twist of German hearthstone and marketplace thought and expression Only when prefaced by abundant oral drill of this sort are written exercises an effective aid in securing requi site accuracy of detail The sound maxim that recommends proceeding from the known to the unknown and from the better known to the less known should guide our choice of authors and texts Our pupils are all more familiar with the nineteenth than with the eighteenth century They are more at home in the second than 218GERMAN LITERATURE IN HIGH SCHOOLS in the first half of the nineteenth century This suggests the advantage of beginning with recent rather than with remote authors Rather intensive study of comparatively recent works is the best sort of key to an adequate interpretation of thought less familiar to the learner through remoteness of time or of range The sequence of works studied would then be based upon an application of the general principle just mentioned to the circumstances of the particular case We have all been distressed at the signal failure attendant upon the use of eighteenthcentury classics as an introduction of American learners to German literature The double reason for this failure is linguistic and social first we have already emphasized the ridiculously scanty language equipment some times deemed adequate for such an experiment some of us have listened to helpless statements of the victims of this pro cedure who in claiming credit for previous work were not sure whether they had read anything written by Lessing or Schiller but had the impression that they had read Goethes Faust These students have rarely done a sufficient amount of wellselected and sharply supervised work in the German of today to give them that feeling of athomeness in the language without which there can be no consciousness of mastery For such students all the archaisms all the obsolete and obso lescent words and idioms found in the eighteenthcentury clas sics are in no sense different from the difficulties of current speech not yet overcome by them Only blind groping is possible in such premises discouragement and indifference are the im mediate result and positive dislike for the subject usually the secondary result of a struggle against such odds Furthermore the works of the eighteenth century took shape under political and social conditions quite remote from those of the present moment in America It is not easy for the American pupil mentally to bridge the wide gulf between our own social con ditions and German society of the eighteenth century This is therefore another valid reason for deferring the study of works that reflect these earlier social conditions and movements until a substantial beginning has been made in the study of nine 2I9THE SCHOOL REVIEW teenthcentury literature In fact there are but few works of the earlier period that should be included even in a four year course of German reading We should not lose sight of the fact that the chief aim of all school work in German during the first three years should be to teach our pupils how tol acquire throughout the range of as much of their mental activity as possible the peculiar habits of German thought and expression Success at this point is of paramount importance for it alone removes the philistinism of the American student with respect to the essence of the language and renders possible facetoface communion with the foreign author For this purpose the works read must furnish the material for a vast amount of oral and written exercises These exercises not only test the thoroughness with which the learner has appropriated the German authors thought but are also the most effective means for securing increasing control of the foreign idiom Such exercises are most fruitful when under taken in connection with texts differing but slightly from the spoken German of today This is an additional reason for reserving until the fourth year the study of works like Schillers Wilhelm Tell or Maria Stuart and Goethes Hermann und Dorothea A wise selection of modern authors and works yields an abundance of vocabulary the mastery of whose discrepancies from the English vernacular affords the best conceivable van tageground from which to attack the difficulties of classic style Pupils of the highschool age are still chiefly interested in concrete thinking They are not yet addicted to much abstract reflection about the objects of their observation and experience They are more easily drawn toi the reading of literature than to a never so cleverly constructed consideration of the develop ment of literature The teacher of German in the high school mindful of this fact will refrain from all attempts to teach the chronological geographical and philosophical aspects of Ger man literary history He will confine his attention largely to groups of authors represented by the writers actually read and discussed in the class He will emphasize the qualities of the works thus examined call attention to the similarities between 220GERMAN LITERATURE IN HIGH SCHOOLS them and those in the vernacular already familiar to the student or to the unique features of the foreign products The teacher will use as skilfully as possible whatever insight he may possess into the substance structure and beauty of these products to stimulate in his pupils similar insight and appreciation But he will subordinate all efforts of this kind to the main purpose of allowing the foreign author to make his own appeal to the reader By such retrenchment of material and concentration of atten tion the pupil receives a far better preparation for subsequent work in the history of German literature than could be secured in any other way For firsthand acquaintance with wellchosen representative writers is the surest means of acquiring a relish for further study in the same direction Teachers are often tempted to substitute for direct study of language and literature like that here recommended talk about the facts oif language and literature This is especially true if they rely chiefly upon the pupils vernacular as classroom means of communication The result in the case of the student thus taught is great ver nacular glibness about topics but dimly understood and in some cases the conceit of halfknowledge or of absolute igno rance The earnest teacher will draw from this his own inference The choice of individual writers within the range of nine teenthcentury prose is of great importance It should be guided by such considerations as the age previous reading and within reasonable limits the taste of the pupils Such considerations should weigh most heavily in the initial steps of the work They help to increase the interest of the learner in a subject with which he is essentially unfamiliar Their importance diminishes rapidly as soon as the study is fairly under way and the pupil has become somewhat accustomed to the foreign atmosphere Similar to although not identical with the importance of such considerations is a justifiable regard for the sex of the learner Even in America the land of equal opportunity boys and girls of highschool age are not appealed to equally by the same lines of literature Of course there is no excuse for read ing with boys or girls tales colored by mawkish sentiment or 221THE SCHOOL REVIEW romantic sentimentality There are plenty of wholesome stories entirely free from this objectionable feature But within this gen eral range there are books whose subject and treatment are espe cially attractive to boys who a little behind their sisters in mental development still delight chiefly in descriptions of practical and successful activity While their sisters often show a liking for tales of knights and ladies and deeds of chivalry the boys prefer stories of everyday life involving the efforts of modern men to enlist the forces of nature in the service of the race or to take an active part in the struggles defeats and triumphs of modern society This should be kept in mind in selecting the German books to be read in the highschool course It is surely not a matter of indifference for the American teacher to ascertain what in the eyes of German educators are some of the best lines of literature for the presentday youth of Germany as one means among several of determining what is suitable for our own boys and girls A very useful book of reference containing representative opinions of German school men concerning this important subject is entitled Zur Jugend schriftenfrage Leipzig I903 It is a report of the Vereinigte deutsche Priifungsausschiisse fiir Jugendschriften and contains among other things brief evaluations of about two hundred and thirty books1 We are in my opinion in danger of selecting too difficult rather than too easy texts Nothing is more discouraging for the learner than the use of texts so full of technical difficulties as to preclude all real mastery even for those willing to bring to bear upon them a large amount of hard work No blindness to the difficulties involved and no foolish pride in conducting a so called advanced course should be permitted to stand in the way of a suitable selection of readingmatter While it is desir able to select material that will appeal strongly to the interest of the learner this purpose may easily be defeated if the vocabu lary syntax and style are beyond his capacity It is equally fatal to employ works the maturity of whose thought makes z Der literarische Ratgeber of Der Kunstwart edited by F Avenarius Dresden and Munich I887 is an excellent guide to the best products of recent and current German literature 222GERMAN LITERATURE IN HIGH SCHOOLS unreasonable demands upon the class In this connection I have in mind such works as Lessings Nathan der Weise Schillers Jungfrau von Orleans and Goethes Iphigenie and Tasso In saying this we should recall however the danger of the oppo site extreme that of trite simplicity This consideration would discourage the excessive use of that type olf fairy tale which appeals primarily to the childish taste of pupils below the high school age yet we all know that both English and German abound in genuine childtales that are not below the level of even the maturest minds For the sake of variety the teacher should include in his selection passages of description narration and conversation Because of the close touch of the short play with the language of everyday life and for the sake of enlisting the natural dra matic instinct of youth in the task in hand it is distinctly advisable to include at least one bright modern play in the high school German course Under favorable circumstances such a play can be utilized in a variety of ways including informal classroom dialogue and a more formal presentation before the whole school The average highschool pupil cares littlefar too littlefor English poetry He can usually become interested in the Ger man lyric if only an occasional poem is included in the reading especially if due regard is paid to the concreteness and sing ability of the poems chosen The reading of an occasional lyric poem should however be deferred until the linguistic equipment of the learner is sufficient to enable him to read understand and enjoy the song without translation For lyric poems are inevitably murdered by the pupils translation and become instead of joyous song birds mute and sorrylooking museum specimens with glass eyes In place of the prevailing American use of prose fiction it seems to me that we should do well to devote more time and attention to the reading of comparatively easy versions of Ger man history Attempts in this direction have in the past fre quently failed to yield the good results hoped for because of the stylistic difficulties presented by the texts chosen for the 223THE SCHOOL REVIEW experiment Much better for the purpose of interesting and informing our American youth concerning the salient features of Germanys past are books like Erzdhlungen aus der deutschen Geschichte fur Schule und Haus by Josepha Schrakamp pub lished by Holt  Co in I888 and the Deutsches Reformlese buch published by D L Savory through the Oxford University Press I9IO The inclusion of considerable historical reading in the highschool German course is justified by a due regard for the prevailing craving of American children for fact in place of fancy and by the unique chance afforded by such reading for giving our pupils some conception of the social and political soil out of which modern Germany has sprung To sum up in a word the points I have attempted to empha size in the foregoing I recommend focusing attention upon nine teenthcentury prose a sparing use of eighteenthcentury classics late in the course adjusting the choice of literature to the age maturity and sex of the learner including in the later stages of the work a few of the most musical of German lyrics with a bright modern play or two and a larger proportion of easy historical reading matter than is usually read in our high school course and above all I recommend avoiding much ver nacular talk about German literature and teaching the subject directly through contact with carefully chosen German authors 224

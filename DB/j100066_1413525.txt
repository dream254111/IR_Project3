and a half the real root of the problem seems never to have been un earthed1 and the difficulty has been that no investigator has attacked the problem intensively from an introspective point of view The investigation herein reported aims to describe the func tioning of synaesthetic phenomena in a blind subject and to offer as check data the results from similar experimentation upon a second blind subject who is asynaesthetic The data were ob tained at different intervals of time from I9I6I92I but always under the same conditions and with carefully guarded instruc tions Our synaesthetic subject Thomas D Cutsforth A is a graduate student in psychology and a well trained intro spector He lost his sight at the age of eleven Our other blind subject B Leslie C Blades is likewise a well trained intro spector and at the time of experimentation was an advanced student in psychology He lost his sight at the age of nine 1See R H Wheeler The Synaesthesia of a Blind Subject Univ of Ore Pubs i No 5 1920 361WHEELER AND CUTSFORTH Owing to the fact that during part of the investigation ob server B was not available data from a third subject W the senior writer have been used as check material The present study falls into two parts i an analysis of the process of recognizing and 2 a study of the development of meaning The instructions to the reagents will serve as a de scription of method 2 GROUP I EXPERIMENTS ON RECOGNITION Instructions to BI shall present to you a Braille letter punched in the middle of a rectangular piece of tagboard You will find the tagboard located on the table directly in front of you and in a small wooden frame I shall give you a ready signal followed by now whereupon you are to inspect the letter in normal fashion as if reading The instant you have recognized the letter stop and begin your introspection at once Ready now a Typical Introspective Data i Observer B The letter was 1 The Aufgabe was present to consciousness in terms of a focal perception of Es voice together with incipient tendencies for the fingers of my right hand to assume the position of investigating a pointletter and the vocalmotorauditory Wonder what it will be As I began to make the arm and finger movements across the tagboard from left to right consciousness was occupied with tactual sensations of smoothness and kinaesthetic sensations of keeping my finger in the proper position these latter were localized principally about the wrist and elbow During this procedure however my attention was cen tered tactually upon the tip of my second finger and I was conscious of a tactual set or anticipation a preparedness to receive an actual tactual impression of a point part of which was also incipient strain localized in the finger and knuckle joints Along with this set were tensions about the brows and shoulders Then I was tactually aware of touching the first point the outstanding feature of which at the outset was a momentary consciousness of something other than smooth surface this consciousness did not develop into a fullfledged awareness of a distinct point but turned at once into an awareness of a solid line running at right angles to my finger movement All of this occurred while the right side of my finger was in contact with the points and while the lefthand side of the finger was still resting upon smooth surface in the fringe of consciousness there still lingered an awareness of this smooth surface There then developed a very fleeting and vague tactual image of the letter 1 I noticed the difference between this tactual image and the perception which had thus far devel oped the perception had as yet no definite ends either at the top or the bottom it was merely the perception of a line but the image contained a definite height that is the distinctive features of the perception were its straightness and direction while the distinctive feature of the image was its vertical length I then found myself hesitating momentarilya sus pension of judgmentconsisting merely of a slight tendency to inhibit arm and finger movement and of rising tensions in my throat and shoulders I then moved my finger until the points fell beneath the middle of the finger tip this movement was not straight to the right but was made in the form of a tiny arc thereupon the letter clarified first by a momentary standing out in focal tactual consciousness of the top point the lower two points re 362SYNAESTHESIA AND MEANING maining as a bar or solid line While the upper dot was thus being foca lized I was momentarily conscious of its roundness and smallness There then reappeared the tactual image of 1 which entered consciousness very suddenly and developed at once to a high degree of clearness I then found myself saying  and began to relax generally During the entire process I was not conscious of familiarity as such In fact the instant my tactual image of the 1 appeared I began to relax 2 Observer B Similar instructions except that a New York Point letter was used The letter was New York Point f As before I was first aware of tactual and kinaesthetic sensations having to do with ap proaching the points from the left The first point appeared as a localized blunt pressure with attention momentarily taking in the roundness and smallness of the point while tapering off in consciousness was the smoothness of the paper against the left half of the ventral surface of my fingertip Then as my finger covered the letter as a whole I did not perceive the in dividual points first there appeared a tactual bar or line with no definite beginning or ending as this lineconsciousness lingered for an instant the three points became distinct arranged in a straight line Then there appeared a vague tactual image of a short lineits shortness and direction being the only definite featuresin response to which I found myself re laxing and at the same time having the vocalmotorauditory f  Instructions I am about to present you with an object which you are to recognize tactual fashion It will be located in the center of a rectangular piece of tagboard and the tag board will be in a cardboard frame Place your finger here E guided As hand opposite and to the left of the object When I say ready approach it slowly and as soon as you have recognized it begin to introspect 3 Observer A As I laid my finger upon the tagboard and began to move across toward the right I was conscious of wondering what the object might be of the smoothness of the paper and of kinaesthetic sensations in fingers wrist and elbow Then my attention was claimed tactually by a localized and rather sudden wellingup of a pressure sensa tion which did not develop into a consciousness of a Braille point but merely into the awareness of something blunt The instant the above tactual impressions appeared I began to visualize the yellow of the tagboard but when I came in contact with the first point my attention was ab sorbed with the change from smoothness to bluntness Before this con sciousness developed very far I became aware of two more blunt points localized adjacent to the first one here attention centered momentarily upon the midposition between the latter two points There then at once appeared visual imagery of a jeweled pin only the head of which stood out focally in consciousness it was localized at my fingertip and was fol lowed very suddenly by incipient finger movement upward and to the left as if to ascertain if the pin would roll when I moved it This visual image was fleeting and vague involving merely a small area of yellow with two bright spots in the center There then developed an awareness that the jewels might be set in the form of a cross whereupon I found myself making very slight and incipient finger movements of exploring for the other jewels In this process my finger came in contact with a point above those which I had already perceived the instant this point appeared I found my at tention grouping the three lefthand points spatially the threeness of the points gave way to a tactual line in which direction and length stood out as its prominent features During this time the yellow and white of the visualized jeweled pin had been persisting But now the tactual per ception enlarged to take in the fourth point on the right of the figure and 363WHEELER AND CUTSFORTH at this instant the jeweled pin vanished and suddenly taking its place was a yellowishred blotch localized at my fingertip momentarily the tactual processes entirely receded from consciousness and I found my attention entirely absorbed with this patch of color which was stable clear and vivid Then I found myself tending to relax muscles loosened about the fingers wrist arm and shoulders together with tendencies to take a long breath This relaxation might have been interpreted as a feeling of famil iarity but I was not aware of it at the time as such The appearance of the yellowishred was my identification of the letter as k I had no vocal motor imagery or other identifying imagery until after I knew that it was k the color informed me that the letter was k  4 Observer A Same instructions A was aware that the object would be a Braille letter The foreperiod consisted of visualtactual and visualmotor processes having to do with anticipating Braille letters On beginning to move my hand to the right and slightly upward along the paper as is my custom when reading point letters I was first conscious of tactualkinaestheticvisual smoothness of the paper and of armmovement Upon reaching the first point I received a blunt tactual sensation together with visual imagery of the point raised up like a tiny knob from the surface of the tagboard and colored the yellow of tagboard The second point was perceived and visualized in a similar fashion But I had no sooner perceived the second dot than the two became spatially arranged in an oblique line slanting down and to the right There followed a very sudden recognition of the letter as o which consisted of a sudden change from the yellowbuff tagboard color in which I had been visualizing the points into a very light faded potatopeelinggreyan almost colorless watery greytinged with a faint bluish darkness But no sooner had this latter visual process developed than it was interrupted in its course by a tactual perception of another point above those which I had already detected Before this latter tactual consciousness had grown into a definite tactual visual awareness of a point I found myself in kinaesthetic fashion tending to make the bend formed by the three points this was a fleeting and vague image but was localized in my fingers and wrist Immediately following was the sudden appearance of a small bluish black area localized at my fingertip the visual image tending as it developed to assume the shape of the figure formed by the three points Here my attention was centered upon the darkness hue and shape of the visual process and the tactual elements entirely receded from consciousness The color appeared sud denly and with no warning the immediate antecedent of which was the motor image just described it seemed as if the visual image instead of tactual processes were coming from my fingertip so sudden was the ad vent into consciousness of this visual image that it had developed before my finger had fairly covered the last point in the letter immediately upon the advent of this visual image I relaxed During the false recognition of the letter as o tensions had increased I had been momentarily conscious that the Aufgabe had not been fulfilled this had consisted of facial neck and shoulder tensions Then and now I was not conscious of familiarity as such the suddenness with which the color appeared its persistence in focal consciousness with subsequent bodily relaxations are all that I could say constituted familiarity But my relaxation means to me a fulfillment of the task rather than an awareness of familiarity The letter was b the bluishblack visual image meant b 5 Observer A Same instructions The letter was q This pro cess of recognizing was extremely rapid and involved only one movement of my finger As before I was at first conscious of the smoothness of the paper and of finger movement followed by the sharply localized blunt pressure of the lower point I obtained the next two points as a bar not two isolated points with the focus of attention centered upon the mid 364SYNAESTHESIA AND MEANING space between them This tactualspatial perception was very fleeting and vague and accompanied by a relatively much clearer visualization of the points in yellowbuff raised upon the tagboard With no intervening processes this visual imagery at once shifted to the reddish brown of f there followed a very attenuated perception of the upper two points of the figure arranged as they came in the form of a bar this tactualspatial perception lingered just long enough for me to catch it and then shifted suddenly into the dark pale bottlegreen of q the five points at no time became spatially arranged as a group either tactually or visually the blu ishgreen of the q appeared from above rapidly covering the reddish brown of the f just as a curtain might fall and cover the one behindit I had no sign of verbal imagery the color of the q covered a larger area on my fingertip than did the color for f the former being a larger letter I was able to detect the manner in which the first color meaning f en tered consciousness it first appeared just above the upper joint at my finger tip and spread rapidly over the previously visualized points covering the lower one last In case of the q the color appeared at the top as did the f first blotting out the upper edge of the colored fpatch it then spread downward until it formed a square area then the left side of the square continued to grow in a downward direction forming a onesided extension or appendage on the square Thus the color as it developed shaped itself in the general form of the letter it was only in terms of this shape of the visual image that I was conscious of the spatial arrangement of the points which go to make up the letter b Summary of Introspective Data on Recognition Observer A As procedure in recognizing Braille letters may be summarized as follows He first perceives the point or points with which he comes in contact If the first point happens to be isolated the tactual sensation momentarily lingers in consciousness but if he comes in contact with two or more points simultaneously he does not perceive these points as individuals but finds that his attention is grouping them into a linear bar For a brief instant this spatialization is tactualvisual but tends at once to give way entirely to visual imagery of yellow points raised upon yellow tagboard If the letter be a simple or small one including not more than two or three points there at once appears a colored area localized at his fingertip This area grows into the shape of the letter and the particular hue or brightness of this visual image constitutes either a tentative or final labelling of the letter If however the letter is a large one involving four or five points this first color to develop may be a false recognition The correction is made in terms of a new or second color which drowns out covers or blots out the preceding color This last color to appear the color which finally identifies the letter is aroused by an antecedent consciousness the duration of which is so brief that it is reported merely as the awareness of striking against something The undeveloped consciousness of an ad ditional point or bar of points in the figure serves to usher into focal attention the appropriate and final color This undevel 365WHEELER AND CUTSFORTH oped consciousness does not contain identifiable tactual el ements It is merely consciousness of something Feelings of familiarity consist merely of the suddenness with which a color develops at the fingertip and the centering of attention upon the hue and shape of the colored area with now and then a kinaesthetic process of anticipation orver ification As processes of recognizing then consist not essentially in the arousal of feelings of familiarity but in the behavior of colored visual imagery If a color appears and runs its course with no interruption by the subsequent arousal of another color the recognition is complete if one color is superseded by another the first constituted but a tentative or false recogni tion In either case it is a color which has identified the letter in question c Recognitions of A and B Compared B like A found himself arranging the points into bars or lines the instant they were detected tactualmotor fashion and like A he was not aware of individual points as such unless they occupied an isolated position in the letter In Bs case as in As the first spatial grouping of the points is vague and does not include definite spatial limits lines or bars are perceived as straight or as running in a certain direction but at first their exact length or height is not perceived In both reagents this vague tactual perception undergoes a process of clarification Bs procedure here involves the appearance of a tactual image of the letter in which the bars or lines possess definite dimen sions In As case this clarificationprocess takes place in terms of visual imagery Continued finger movement in both re agents results in prolonging and in further definitizing this spatial grouping of the points In B the grouping is done in tactual kinaesthetic terms in A it is done in visualkinaesthetic terms the visual feature of the process beginning with images of the yellowbuff tagboard points spatially grouped as they are visualized and ending in another colored visual image in which the individual points have lost their identity This latter visual image identifies the letter by means of its hue and shape prin cipally by hue This final grouping of the points in Bs case undergoes a similar dropping out of concrete and identifiable points the spatial blend becomes perfectthe individual points lose their identity and appear as a grouped formation This group is perceived as triangular square or what not ac cording to its form But Bs mental content in this procedure is implicitly tactual while As mental content is visual the previous tactual processes receding or disappearing altogether To sum up Bs procedure in recognizing there first appears a shift of attention from individual points to bars or lines then 366SYNAESTHESIA AND MEANING from bars or lines either to tactual imagery of a letter or to more definitely perceived spatial arrangements of these points Here the points lose their individuality as separate bluntnesses and fuse into a spatialized blend this latter process gives way to definite tactual imagery or to vocalmotor imagery of the letter There is no visual imagery during the entire process Thus Bs processes of recognizing consist of the development of tactual and later of verbal imagery from tactual perceptions As processes of recognizing consist of the development of visual imagery from tactual perceptions The content which labels the letter in Bs case may be a tactual or a verbal image In As case it is invariably a colored visual image of a certain hue brightness or shape These colors are identical with those which appear whenever A is thinking in terms of letters they are the same as appear upon hearing the letters of the alphabet pronounced and they are also the same as appear in his alpha bet and number forms Imagery of letters is invariably visual imagery of these colors and not tactual imagery The striking fact which is derived from a comparison of As procedure with Bs is the similarity in function in the two in dividuals but the marked difference in mental content A recognizes letters by means of their synaesthetic visual asso ciates but the fact that A is synaesthetic does not render his processes of recognizing functionally different from Bs Stage by stage the two individuals recognize in identical fashion Both reagents must identify the object to be recognized in either case the object must be labelled As synaesthetic visual imagery is not an incidental and superfluous process in recognizing there are no incidental or superfluous processes in Bs recognitions As colored associates for letters identify or label those letters as does Bs tactual or verbal imagery d Significance of As Synaesthetic Phenomena in the Process of Recognizing The temporal position of As synaesthetic visual images in processes of recognizing clearly points to but one interpretation namely that the visual associates are the essential components of the process and that they are integral parts of the develop ment of meaning The blurred tactual perception of points in the case of recognizing Braille letters for example means nothing to A except as a preliminary stage in the course of rlecognizing for it must be definitized by visual imagery Then after the points have been perceived in their spatial arrangement through the aid of visual imagery the object does not yet mean a certain letter rather than any other letter of the alphabet This visualized grouping of points must undergo a change or be identified with the aid of some subsequent process It hap 367WHEELER AND CUTSFORTH pens to be a stereotyped colored visual image and hence a synaesthetic image which thus identifies a certain spatially arranged group of points as b or 1 or q or what not A parallel procedure is to be found in Bs processes of recog nizing but the latter involve tactual and kinaesthetic contents in the place of As synaesthetic images Where meaning de velops in Bs case by means of rapid attentionshifts from tactual perception to tactual image or from tactual perception to verbal image or from tactual perception direct to motor relaxation it develops in As case by means of a rapid shift of attention from an undeveloped tactual perception to a visual grouping of points and hence by way of a stereotyped visual synaesthetic image to motor response or in the more mechan ized recognitions directly from an undeveloped tactual per ception through a synaesthetic visual image to motor response In every instance however a motor response or relaxation will not label a letter there must first appear a colored visual associate There is no doubt therefore that the colored asso ciates of letters mean those letters in As case and that without these colored associates the process of recognizing could not take place This fact gives us a clue to the functional significance of familiarity in processes of recognizing If we compare As proce dure with introspections obtained by Woods in her investiga tions of recognizing2 we discover that As colored visual imagery functions as a substitute for the incipient organic and motor responses which her Os reported as feelings of familiarity The shift from tactual to visual attention in As case means familiar ity colored visual associates function both as a general and as a specific label for the object recognized We assume that a feeling of familiarity is but a species of development of meaning and that in a general way it identifies the object to be recognized as old or as belonging to past experience Since in As case the color which appears in connection with a certain per ception is always the same as the color which appeared with that perception in all previous experiences the presence of the color itself in a subsequent experience is the familiarity of that experience In other words since the visual synaesthetic image is always stereotyped it is the same experience which was had before There can be no doubt about the identity or sameness of the experience The invariable and stereotyped feature of the visual associate thus attenuates the process of feeling familiar it provides implicit certainty in any subsequent recognition process it allows for no hesitation wondering or fluctuation of attention Hence the relatively prolonged and laborious process of experiencing a feeling of familiarity is unnecessary 2This JOURNAL 26 I915 313387 368SYNAESTHESIA AND MEANING in As case for an object or perception indefinitely labelled as familiar is by the same process labelled once and for all definite ly and concretely The perception is not only old or famil iar but a definitely and finally identified perception at the same time When we ordinarily recognize as familiar an object a faceor a name we often have the experience of knowing what the object is or of knowing the name of the person whose face is famil iar but we are unable to recall the appropriate name which will finally identify that object or person A experiences a cer tain difficulty in recognizing which further demonstrates our point made in the previous paragraph and which stands out in contrast to the difficulty ordinarily experienced by an asynaes thetic person A often has the difficulty of properly translating a colored visual associate into the appropriate name He has already definitely labelled a person or object by means of his own colorlanguage but he has forgotten the name which translates that color into the English language Thus in teaching biology he sometimes recognizes and as far as his own consciousness is concerned he has definitely and finally labelled a certain but terfly or crustacean The colored visual image which stands for that species is present in his consciousness but the technical name by which the species is generally known has escaped him In such instances as these technical names as such are entirely superfluous to As processes of recognizing or of labelling They mean to him only terms by which the identity of the species in question is made known to other people We have come to use these technical names themselves as final contents which func tion in our own private processes of recognizing as well as con tents which function in social communication But not so for A whose own private processes of recognizing are complete when the appropriate colored visual associate appears regardless of the subsequent arousal of a technical name We believe that this illustration shows further how synaesthetic phenomena not only serve as substitutes for other imaginal processes in acts of recognizing but also function as substitutes for feelings of familiarity Synaesthetic phenomena function both as general and as specific labels for objects to be recognized We cannot understand how all this could take place unless synaesthetic phenomena are derived from and are directly allied with synaesthesia proper When a person has synaes thesia for example colored hearing a certain blue means a flute tone just as much as the auditory quality itself and prob ably more so As far as meaning is concerned that person sees the flute tone as much as if not more than he hears it The color has come to function as an integral element in the process of perceiving And so with the more prolonged and elaborate processes of perceiving which we call recognition 369WHTFELTFR AND CUTSFORTH A further comparative illustration will show how As processes of perceiving are not different functionally from those of asynaesthetic persons When the senior writer hears a flute tone he finds that the focal standingout of the mellow woody roundlike quality together with tendencies to visualize a flute or to say flute constitute the meaning of flute It is the be havior of attention with respect to the auditory visual and kinaesthetic qualities which are present in the act of perceiving which constitutes the development of meaning And without tendencies to visualize or to say flute the tone would not be that of a flute any more than that of some other similarly sound ing instrument But let one sound a flute in As presence the mental contents which appear are different but they function as has just been described A does not attend to the fluty qual ities as such at all in fact he hardly hears them But some thing rises suddenly into focal consciousness to take the place of focalized auditory qualities for no sooner is the flute sounded than a certain quality of blue arises to focal attention So far As procedure corresponds exactly to the procedure of an asyn aesthetic person In the former a visual quality has devel oped in the latter an ordinary quality has developed Next however in As case the hue or other qualitative feature of the visual image is recognized or identified This particular hue or quality identifies the sound as coming from a flute This pro cedure corresponds exactly to that of an asynaesthetic person who has tended to visualize a flute or to say flute in that both persons have now by their final procedure recognized or labelled the flute tone As long as As attention fails to take in the blue color in perceiving a flute he does not know the sound of a flute from the roaring of a distant locomotive whistle So long as a similarly functioning contextual image does not develop in the consciousness of an asynaesthetic person the sound of a flute cannot be differentiated from any other sound We con clude that in the very beginning of As mental life synaesthesia developed as an integral part of perceiving His synaesthesia is the act of perceiving itself As synaesthetic images function in like manner in his pro cesses of recognizing While from the point of view of the asyn aesthetic person As visual associates stand for something else and mean something else than visual images we must not con clude that their functioning in consciousness is different from that of the asynaesthetic individual In so concluding we forget that the process of deriving meaning even in perceiving and in recognizing demands the presence of some process other than the one recognized or identified Certain contextual imagery is necessary such as the visual or the vocalmotor mentioned above in connection with perceiving a flute tone As syn aesthetic images happen to constitute this contextual imagery 370SYNAESTHESIA AND MEANING 3 GROUP 2 AUDITORY METHOD The above experiments lead to the conclusion that syn aesthesia is a phenomenon of meaning in As case In order to determine whether our interpretation and findings were cor rect a second series of experiments was performed on subject A with W as check observer In this series of experiments various lists of nonsensesyllables were presented to the reagent in auditory fashion Each list included one or more meaningful words having the same num ber of letters as the nonsensesyllables and was so arranged as to make the process of introspecting upon the development of meaning as easy as possible This was done by varying only one letter of the syllable each time as for example bih bij bik bil 1 or fab mab sab pab lab oratory and the like Thus As consciousness during the presentation of the series and up to the appearance of the meaningful word would not rad ically change and would be simple enough in content to make a very detailed introspection possible The changes which would then appear as soon as A became aware of a meaningful word would stand out in contrast to the previous mental pro cesses The instructions to A were as follows I am going to present to you a list of nonsensesyllables auditory fashion in which there will appear sooner or later a meaningful word The instant you are aware of meaning respond by saying now I will then stop the presentations You will be asked to give me a very detailed introspective description of the processes in volved in the development of the meaningful process The syllables were presented at I sec intervals in order to prevent the arousal of associations and in order possibly to provide instances in which E might repeat a meaningful word without arousing a response on As part a Introspective Data 6 Observer A Series bih bij bil 1 Response at once to the word bil As E was repeating the first two syllables I was at no time focally aware of the sound of his voice each time just as the sound commenced I was aware only of something nonfocally then I found that my attention was at once claimed by a dark bluish thick amorphous patchof color about the size of ones hand with this color I was aware nonfocally of repeating the syllable in vocalmotor imagery the development of processes fol lowing the presentation of the third syllable was very rapid Just as E was saying the b of bil 1 there appeared the same blue patch as before and as before I found myself vocalizing the syllable but with the focus of attention centered upon the patch of color In case of the preceding syllables the blue patch remained during the vocalization of the syllables i e the color did not change But I no sooner found myself vocalizing the word bil 1 than there appeared extended off from the right side of the blue patch an area of white from the 1 sound in bil 1 the color came in as if the blue patch grew outward toward the right while the left side 37IWHEERER AND CUTSFORTH of the patch retained its original blue along with the appearance of the white I found my eyemovement tending toward the right with the growth of the visual image No sooner had this extension of color appeared than I found myself responding in motor fashion and as I was reacting I had faint visual imagery of a sheet of paper which was the beginning of a con sciousness that the bill meant to me a legislative bill the immediate antecedent of my response was the extension of the blue patch meaning appeared with this behavior of the visual image and this meaning was subsequently made more concrete by the appearance of the visualized sheet of paper which in turn was interpreted in terms of vocalmotor imagery but after I had reacted I forgot to mention that with the ap pearance of vocalmotor imagery of bil 1 the blue part of the synaes thetic image increased slightly in size and became more saturated 7 Observer A Series bop bor bov boy Response at once upon hearing the word boy As before the auditory perceptions of the first three syllables involved a shift of attention to visual patches the color of which was the same blue as for the previous syllables and which was de termined by the b sound in the syllables As I perceived the b of boy there appeared the same blue patch then as my attention lingered upon this visual image I found myself saying the word boy in vocalmotor imagery but only nonfocally here the qualities of the vocalmotor image are indistinct and vague obscure and undefinitized it would be impossible to describe its qualities because there are no distinguishable qualities pres ent other than a general image of movement localized in my throat In exactly the same fashion as in the previous case the blue patch then ex tended on the right first into the light yellow of the o and farther on into a brighter yellow of the y my attdntion was wholly absorbed in these colorchanges which seemed to develop rapidly of themselves I then found myself responding 8 Observer A Series cag caj caz cat During this experiment I found that the color of the first two syllables was determined by the ca sound of Es voice I set up for myself the subsidiary task of inhibiting my vocalmotor imagery in order to ascertain whether or not I was using it As a result of this inhibition of vocalmotor imagery I was unable to per ceive the cag The ca sound aroused a smokyblue white but I was un able to tell whether or not it had any meaning The color merely appeared and did not change Just as E was repeating the second syllable I had vocalmotor imagery of the first syllablethe cag which I had only im perfectly perceived beforewhereupon I recognized the colors as colors for definite letters my recognition consisted wholly of a rapid shift from vocalmotor to visual synaesthetic imagery I had previously recognized that the colors for ca stood for ca by means of accompanying vocalization of the casound this color had drowned out the color for the g in previous experiments I found either that the color for the last letter in the syllable was not entirely drowned out or that I vivified that color by vocal izing the last letter when E said cat I was already anticipating the smokywhite patch which stood for the casound but no sooner was the word pronounced than I had vocalmotor imagery of the syllable together with focal visual attention centered upon an extension of the smokywhite patch toward the right into the reddishbrown of the t I then found myself reacting 9 Observer A Series vad yad zad sad When E repeated the first syllable I found my attention at once claimed by a patch of colors the hue of which was determined by the letter v on hearing the second syllable this color was slightly changed by the difference in the sound of the first letter y then I at once began to anticipate the appearance of the third syllable in terms of this same color so that just as the third syllable was repeated my visual attention was already absorbed with this color 372SYNAESTHESIA AND MEANING but the instant the zad was pronounced there appeared a conflict between the persisting yellowishgrey of the y and a reddishbrown patch which latter tended to appear with the auditory perception of the z sound in zad The first stage of this conflict consisted of a shaking or shivering of the y color then the colors for both y and z began to smudge or mix together into a sort of emulsion of color in which spots and streaks of one color intermingled spatially with spots and streaks of the other color then I found myself having vocalmotor imagery of zad where upon all trace of the yellowishgrey of the y vanished and was replaced by a smooth patch or area of reddishbrown This awareness of colorcon flicts was accompanied by a developing motor attitude of dissatisfaction and unpleasantness characterized by tendencies to frown marked ten sions in the throat and tendencies to tighten about the chest and shoulders But there then tended to appear the yellowishgrey patch of the y ac companied by vocalmotor imagery of y this was but the beginning of a consciousness that the first letter of the syllables should begin with y I was trying to visualize all of the first letters of the syllables alike instead of the last letters this reappearance of the color for the y took place just to the left of the persisting reddishbrown of the z and for a moment there was perceptible eyestrain of tending to look toward the right as my imaginal line of regard lingered in the direction of the z color By this time E had pronounced the syllable sad this happened just as my visual attention was beginning to shift for the last time from the reddishbrown of the z to the yellowishgrey of the y the auditory perception of sad was accompanied by a sudden appearance of a light yellow patch which at once superimposed itself on or slapped down over the persisting greyer yellow of the y the next instant I found myself having vocalmotor imagery of sad and together with this verbal image the light yellow patch enlarged toward the right changing into a dull greenish blue in dicating the d sound of sad concomitantly with this shift or extension from the righthand side of the yellow patch I was aware of a motor atti tude of satisfaction consisting of pleasantness which was bound up with chest relaxations of relaxations about the abdomen throat and mouth This response also served as an awareness that the task tas over During the entire process however my attention was focussed upon changing colors and brightnesses Io Observer A Series hov hot hom hop hok The reagent did not react until E came to the syllable hok when he responded at once Upon perceiving the first syllable there appeared a very definite and vivid chocolatebrown color representing the hosound so vivid that I found myself momentarily absorbed in gazing at the color as it persisted in the focus of my visual attention Then as I found myself having vocalmotor imagery of the syllable meaning tended to develop This consisted first of a tendency for the chocolatebrown color to extend on the right into a very light yellowish white then it seemed as if I should subsequently recognize the meaning but I could not this latter consciousness was a slight tendency to relax in the presence of the changing color But the motor relaxationabout chest and facehad but just begun when it ceased to develop and I found my attention centered visually upon a per sisting yellowishwhite patch I was gazing blankly at the extended colored patch This gazing continued until the next syllable was pronounced The brown of the hosound then considerably brightened and became more saturated my visual attention lingered on this color more focally than before but still nothing happened nothing new then happened until E pronounced the word hok up to this time I was merely having the synaesthetic imagery plus the verbal imagery of the syllables upon hear ing hok I vocalized it as usual but there at once developed on the right hand edge of the chocolatebrown patch a reddishbrown almost orange extension I found myself responding the word had meaning the minute 373WHEELER AND CUTSFORTH this change in the visual imagery took place The response consisted of a general diffused bodily tendency to relax particularly about the throat and chest This response seemed to me a recognition of the fact that the change in the visual image had meaning I then said now  i  Observer A Series xap wap sap During the foreperiod I was aware of increasing strains about the throat chest and jaws Upon perceiving the first syllable the appropriate color appeared at once in the foreground of my visual field Nothing new appeared in consciousness until E repeated the word sap at this juncture I was already repeating the synaesthetic image in anticipation of the coming syllable as I vocalizedthis syllable there appeared to the left of the pcolor the light yellow of the ssound Together with this change in the visual imagery I found myself tending to relax but this did not develop very far Consciousness was claimed focally by tendencies to fixate my visual field more rigidly than be fore I was moving my line of regard about the yellowishwhite synaesthetic image of sap which was still persisting this was the beginning of a con sciousness of wondering what sap it was then the colors in my visual field turned into a large green area out from the bottom of which there developed a brownish form this was the beginning of a consciousness that sap referred to tree sap then a treetrunk stood out developing from the brownish form which had just appeared and as my visual line of re gard centered itself upon the treetrunk I visualized beneath the bark a layer of white wood This completed my consciousness that the sap was tree sap During this time I was nonfocally aware of greater and greater bodily tensions located particularly in the chest and abdomen These latter processes consisted of a tendency to inhibit the response until the meaning was complete The meaning seemed to develop in the changing visual imagery and my motor attitude seemed to constitute a recognition of the fact that meaning was developing 12 Observer W Series qec pav muz yix log Owing to Ws tendency to anticipate meaning in series of syllables arranged as for ob server A a different type of series had to be presented him First I was aware of tensions about the neck in the throat and shoulders and about the chest having to do with a rigid bodily attitude of preparedness to react quickly as soon as a meaningful word might appear As E Mr Cutsforth read the syllables I found myselfattending focally to each one in turn tend ing at the same time to translate a momentary focal auditory perception of the syllables into visual imagery of the syllables printed in large black letters on a white background immediately following each syllable my attention was claimed by the rapid fashion in which all auditory features dropped out of consciousness and by a shift to consciousness of my bodily attitude which was just described in the auditory perceptions the con sonants tended to stand out far more prominently than the vowels yet these sounds disappeared from consciousness almost as quickly as they appeared When the word log was given I found that my auditory at tention developed to a higher state of vividness and more vigorously than in case of the previous syllables the perception of the auditory qualities was more sudden there seemed to be a different quality in the auditory perception itself consisting of the dominance now of the vowelsound in stead of the consonantsounds as before while this auditory quality of the o sourd developed suddenly to a very high degree of clearness I found myself already responding bodily This bodily response consisted of an incipient tendency to pull my shoulders together to bring my head forward and to jerk slightly my entire right arm While this motor reaction was going on my attention was at first still centered upon the o sound of log But no sooner had the o sound developed to a maximal degree of clearness than I tended to visualize dimly in a background of white light the word log this process did not develop very far however during 374SYNAESTHESIA AND MEANING this time I was looking in the direction of E and slightly to the right of my line of regard there appeared but the beginning stage of a visual image of a timber log lying on its side Merely the shape of one end of the log faint suggestions of corrugations of bark together with a dark brown color appeared with any distinctness at all Accompanying this shift in visual imagery from the word log to a visualized log the motor reaction which had already begun greatly increased in intensity and became a generalized motor set in the direction of the visualized log The entire reaction was so rapid and the motor processes so diffuse and widespread that I could not detect many of the kinaesthetic details the more sharply localized tensions were in the throat and about the eyes the diffused parts of the reaction seemed to be vaguely localized in chest and abdomen I think that if someone had asked me at the time I was perceiving the word itself whether or not it was meaningful I should have said yes although at that time there was no process which seemed to tell me what that meaning was But upon the appearance of the visualized log the meaning became definit ized This particular visual image was so fleeting and vague that I am surprised that it occupied the focus of attention I was attending to it rather than to the motor background The motor background seemed to consist of an attitude of recognition which I assumed toward the visual image of the log it seemed to consist in other words of a recognition of the fact that the processes had meaning b Summary of Introspective Data on the Development of Meaning So far as our series of experiments is concerned development of meaning consisted in As case i in the manner in which visual synaesthetic phenomena developed and 2 in the arousal of a diffused motor and organic reaction which took place immediately following the development of the visual synaesthesia The first stage has to do with the growth of meaning proper and the second has to do with the reagents recognition of the fact that meaning has developed or was be ginning to develop In perceiving a nonsensesyllable As attention shifts to a visual concomitant of the sound of the syllable even while E is pronouncing it This visual associate is determined by the dominant or repeated sound in the series of syllables As long as in the perceiving of these syllables no processes take place other than a vocalmotor image of the syllable together with the visual concomitant the reagent does not react the syllable is meaningless The verbal image appears with the aroused visual associate and is sometimes repeated in order to clarify or prolong the visual associate itself but the verbal process remains nonfocal throughout When a meaningful word is pronounced by E As procedure of perceiving the word begins as do his perceptions of meaningless syllables his attention at once shifts from auditory qualities to their visual associates But from this point on his procedure is different meaning begins to develop The antecedent of this development of meaning consists of a nonfocal verbal image of the word itself 375WHEELER AND CUTSFORTH together with the persisting visual concomitant which latter is the same for the verbal image as it was for the original non focal auditory perception Then the visual associate which is being attendedto focally extends or grows in size taking on additional coloration as it does so These colors are the syn aesthetic associates of the remaining letters in the meaningful syllable So far the development of meaning has passed through its first stage but the process is not complete for the reason that as yet the meaning itself has not been recognized The instruc tions were to react when meaning developed Hence the reagent was disposed to recognize meaning itself before he reacted for the benefit of E If after these colors changed as just de scribed A did not find himself assuming a motor attitude i e responding bodily to the change the process of meaning was halted in its course Such an attitude included relaxations in the chest throat and sometimes abdomen and organic dis turbances which were interpreted to be pleasantness Without such an attitude or without some further mental process A finds himself unable to interpret the change in the color The change in the color means something but what Vocalmotor imagery will not come to As aid for the vocalmotor imagery itself is nonfocal and cannot be attendedto as such moreover the change in the visual synaesthetic image which has already taken place has identified the verbal image so far as it can be identified Thus with no further mental processes other than a shift in the colors A finds himself staring at them blankly the colors themselves are unfamiliar or meaningless until they in turn have been identified If on the other hand with this change or extension in the visual synaesthetic imagery A finds himself reacting in organic motor fashion as well he responds to the syllable as meaning ful So far in our analysis of the development of meaning we have traced its course through two stagesthat of coming into existence and that of being recognized afterwards But our development of meaning is yet incomplete The meaning is still general Sometimes A reacted when the meaning was still in this generalized form introspections 710 he reacted before the concrete meaning had been defined by behavior of additional mental contents Sometimes he went on and defined this mean ing Thus if there is in As behavior an implied Aufgabe to go on and define this meaning see introspections 6 and i i there takes place a third stage A second change appears in his synaesthetic phenomena The synaesthetic processes already present to consciousness give way to further visual imagery or to com 376SYNAESTHESIA AND MEANING bined verbal and visual imagery These latter processes define the meaning of the word specifically For example in one instance As visual attention shifted from synaesthetic imagery of the word bil 1 to visual imagery of a white sheet of paper This was As method of defining bill as a legislative bill Again the yellowishwhite synaesthetic image of sap gave way to a rapidly developing visual image of a green tree hence to a treetrunk in which white wood was seen beneath the bark This was As procedure in limiting or defining the general mean ing of sap which had already developed when the synaes thetic image of sap appeared During the development of this third stage in the growth of meaning the organic reaction characteristic of the second stage is prolonged and this reaction functions as a general motor background for the subsequent mental contents Ws procedure is not different functionally from As but with respect to mental content it is quite different Ws atten tion is suddenly and focally claimed by the auditory qualities of the nonsensesyllables But when a meaningful word is pronounceds this auditory perception develops with greater vigor and to a higher degree of focality This suddenness and ease with which auditory qualities stand out in consciousness corresponds to the sudden clarifying and extension of colors in As consciousness of meaning In either case the meaning has not yet been recognized The procedure of both reagents thus far constitutes an implicit recognition that the word is mean ingful but the meaning itself has not yet been recognized If the development of meaning should stop here W would have found that the word seemed familiar or was about to turn into meaning or ought to have had meaning Such an ex perience on As part may be found in introspection o1 From this point on the appearance of visual imagery in Ws case and the shift from visual synaesthetic imagery to further visual imagery in As case constitute final limitations or definitions of the meaning which has already tended to develop A motor organic reaction in either case constitutes a recognition of the meaning itself The additional visual imagery it may not al ways be visual in Ws case is the stimulus which evokes a widespread motor attitude intensifying the already existing attitude and is also the content which defines the meaning of the word The prolonged motor attitude which was at first a recognition of general meaning now becomes a recognition of defined or limited meaning Thus meaning develops as a dual process consisting i of shifting mental contents which determine the presence or ab sence of meaning and whether the meaning shall be general or specifica stimulus function and 2 of the development of a 377WHEELER AND CUTSFORTH motor attitude in the presence of these shifting contents which constitutes a recognition of this meaninga response function The contents function as stimuli and the motor attitudes as responses If the first appear without the latter meaning is not complete The 0 is then conscious only that meaning began to develop but failed of recognition Thus the full growth of meaning consists not only of the processaspect of shifting men tal contents but also of motor responses in the presence of these processaspects There exist the same temporal relations between the focal standingout of auditory perceptions and the motor response of recognition in Ws case as exist between the appearance of a synaesthetic image and the motor response in As case W testified that meaning began to develop when the auditory processes become highly focalized and that it was his subse quent consciousness of a motor attitude which seemed to con stitute a recognition of this developing meaning that enabled him to offer this testimony A testified that meaning began to develop when his synaesthetic image extended and that it was his consciousness of a motor attitude immediately after wards that enabled him to offer his testimony Careful re views of a mass of introspective data verify these interpreta tions We believe therefore that synaesthetic phenomena and meaning are species of the same genus of mental functions Synaesthesis is an integral part of every cognitive process in a synaesthetic reagent A synaesthetic phenomenon is but a type of behavior of attention and this type of behavior whenever and wherever it takes place constitutes a processaspect of mental contents which in turn constitutes meaning We do not propose to assume that the growth of meaning takes place in all Os and at all times just as we have described it but we are confident that so far as our own experimental method is concerned and so far as our own synaesthetic re agent is concerned mental contents function as they have been interpreted c Significance of Synaesthetic Phenomena in the Development of Meaning Our results from this series of experiments confirm results from earlier series I Synaesthetic phenomena function in differentiating meaningless from meaningful processes and are thus cognitive phenomena as far as their function in mental life is concerned 2 these synaesthetic phenomena are iden tical with their original prototypes synaesthesis proper 3 in the same fashion as visual associates stand for auditory tac tualkinaesthetic or other nonvisual processes these visual 378SYNAESTHESIA AND MEANING associates stand for meaning and 4 the functional problem in synaesthesia and in synaesthetic phenomena is the same this functional problem is identical with the problem of meaning 4 GROUP 3 TACTUAL METHOD In order to demonstrate the development of meaning under such conditions as would necessitate a slow growth several words were stamped in American Braille and exposed to A one at a time but in tachistoscopic fashion That is each word was exposed suddenly and rapidly several times before the in dividual letters grouped themselves into a meaningful word The reagent was instructed to make rapid sweeping movements over the word as a whole at 3 sec intervals until the word was recognized After a practiceseries was performed in order that A might learn the necessary finger technique a regular series of experiments was presented Since the following introspection is typical of all our results we include only one example a Typical Introspective Datum 13 Observer A Word good I recognized the meaning of the word upon the fifth exposure As the tip of my fingers passed over the word the first time I perceived the letter d This perception developed as fol lows at the outset I was aware only of indefinitely grouped blunt points these points at once became arranged spatially in terms of visual imagery and at the same time took on the poorly saturated bluishgrey of the d at this juncture the obscure tactual qualities which had at first appeared entirely vanished and the color of the letter persisted alone in consciousness as my awareness of the letter itself The second time I inspected the word the color of the d persisted in consciousness I failed to add any letters to my consciousness of the word there only appeared meaningless and confused jumbles of tactual impressions which as fast as they appeared shifted to visual grey imagerymy synaesthetic imagery of the temper ature of the paper But during this second inspection I anticipated in terms of greyblue color the d at the end of the word and also in terms of hurried eyemovement toward the right as my finger was moving across the word this greyblue visual image was a small irregular area of color localised at the right end of a rectangular grey form which latter represented the word as a whole The third presentation resulted in perceiving the g My consciousness of the g developed in the same fashion as did the d the very light greenish white color for g persisting in its appropriate position with respect to the oblong block The fourth inspection resulted in per ceiving the second o which appeared first as a meaningless and indefinitely grouped mass of blunt points the pressure qualities at once shifted to visualized points and then suddenly into the dark smudgy black of the letter o The last time I inspected the letters my attention was being claimed by persisting visual imagery of the three which had been perceived I was only nonfocally aware of finger movement just as my fingers touched the points between the letter g and the second o the points which were to become the first o and before these points were given time to arrange themselves into the spatial grouping of a letter there appeared very suddenly a visual synaesthetic image of a double  this latter pro cess was built up by an extension which grew out from the left side of the already existing black smudge which represented the second Vo that is this already existing smudge doubled in size forming a bar instead of a 379WHEELER AND CUTSFORTH small patch of darkness But no sooner had this oo developed in terms of visual imagery than the colors for the single letters which had up to this time been separated by small interspaces of grey background suddenly merged into a continuously colored streak In this merged visual image containing three colors my attention was not centered upon any one par ticular color but upon the group of colors as a whole Together with this merging of the visual imagery I found myself having the nonfocal vocal motor image good When I discovered the first o I noticed the be ginning of a motor expectation consisting of incipient forward movements of my shoulders and of increased throat tensions I interpreted this motor attitude as meaning anticipation of fulfilling the Aufgabe and also desire to find out the meaning of the word As the colors of the word were merging into a solid group I found myself relaxing bodily I distinctly noticed that the colors began merging just antecedent to the appearance of the vocalmotor good and continued beyond my awareness of this verbal process I will now describe the merging more in detail First the color for the letter d slightly shifted its position toward the left until its edges met and fused with the right boundary of the black smudge of the oo then before this change in position had completed itself the colored patch representing g shifted slightly to the right until its edges fused with the left boundary of the oo smudge As these edges fused or blended the colors now representing the word as a whole imperceptibly ran into one another very much I suppose as the colors of a spectrum I was aware of the shiftings of color before I attended to my developing motor response The motor attitude itself seemed to mean anticipation and expectancy on the one hand and a fulfillment of the task on the other The merging of the colors meant to me a recognition of the word and this merging was emphasized by the vocalmotor imagery b Summary and Interpretation of Introspective Data on Tactual Presentations Two problems present themselves with reference to the re sults of this and the former series of experiments One consists of the significance of verbal imagery in connection with As synaesthetic phenomena and the other has to do with the significance of As motor responses in the development of meaning The temporal relationships between the appearance of verbal imagery and of synaesthetic visual imagery in this and the preceding series of experiments indicate that verbal pro cesses contribute to the development of meaning A synaes thetic image is aroused either by an auditory or a tactual stimu lus but before this synaesthetic image has run its course 0 finds himself having verbal imagery of the syllable or of the word Since the verbal process is the syllable or is the word one would expect that ordinarily no further process would be necessary for the development of meaning The verbal image ought to identify or to label the auditory or the tactual per ception In As case however the verbal image always remains nonfocal But invariably the presence of such an image is directly followed by a change in the synaesthetic image toward greater focalitythe visual image becomes brighter more saturated more permanent Hence the verbal image seems to 380SYNAESTHESIA AND MEANING be the cue by which the dissociated synaesthetic image is de finitized Further evidence of this function of verbal imagery is found in instances in which a synaesthetic image persists alone after the original auditory or tactual stimulus has faded entirely from consciousness In the absence of such a nonfocal process as the persisting but vague auditory or tactual feature of the stimulus word the persisting and now detached synaes thetic image means nothing This fact suggests that not only is meaning the processaspect of changing mental contents but that the content toward which the shift is being made must be gin to develop in the presence of the dwindling of the content from which the shift was made And when a synaesthetic image lingers in consciousness beyond the duration of the stimulus content which aroused it it becomes meaningless the instant the nonfocal stimuluscontent entirely vanishes Under these conditions As verbal imagery appears as a substitute for the original stimuluscontent this introduces a new processaspect a new shift of attention now involving a verbal image as the content away from which attention shifts and the persisting synaesthetic image is the content to which attention shifts Thus a reshifting of attention toward the synaesthetic con tent provides it with the lost meaning The question arises does the verbal content provide mean ing to the persistent synaesthetic image or does the existing synaesthetic image now function to provide meaning to the verbal image as it did to the original auditory or tactual stim ulus Since the synaesthetic image existed before the verbal image came in we assume that the verbal process identified the visual note the visual momentarily had no meaning prior to the appearance of the verbal process but the verbal process in As consciousness has no meaning until identified by a visual synaesthetic image hence upon the appearance of the verbal process the persisting visual process which lasts longer than the verbal subsequently defines the verbal process itself This accounts for the fact perhaps that the visual synaes thetic image becomes intensified or clarified upon the appearance of the verbal process It not only was identified but it in turn identified the process which had just identified it This inter changeableness of stimulus and response functions or of cause and effect is not inconsistent Logically causes and effects and stimuli and responses must be interchangeable to function at all As to the second problemthe significance of As bodily motor responses in the development of meaningour data from the present series of experiments furnish us with important suggestions A careful study of Ws introspections in contrast to As shows that the former reagent lays much more stress upon kinaesthetic processes in the development of meaning 38IWHEELER AND CUTSFORTH than does A We have explained that these kinaesthetic pro cesses evidently functioned as contents of recognizing the mean ing of a word or syllable as it began to develop The meaning was the object recognized and the motor response was the recognition of the object But A showed fewer motor ten dencies than did W Evidently then something aside from motor tendencies in As case sufficed in the recognition of mean ing once that meaning began to develop We interpret this difference between W and A to mean that in the former reagent processes of recognizing meaning are more explicit or overt while in the latter reagent these processes of recognizing are more implicit that is they are to be assumed in the behavior of his synaesthetic imagery We have already seen how in As case synaesthetic imagery labels an antecedent mental content both in a general and in a specific manner thus attenuating feelings of familiarity This fact in itself means that As recognitions of meaning tend to take place implicitly because of his synaesthetic phenomena It is evident however that as far as meaning is concerned colors and their behavior alone do not suffice when a given train of associations terminates in a synaesthetic image To possess meaning As synaesthetic colors must themselves be recog nized or they must function as if they were recognized One procedure by which these colors are recognized when they occur in prolonged sequences is by a shift of attention from one color to another The product of this shift defines the antecedent color implicitly But if a train of visual associations fails to lead to a further shift in visual imagery the development or the course of meaning is halted Here the reagent must resort either to verbal or to other kinaesthetic processes The final color is then recognized by means of a motor attitude Thus as long as colors keep changing from one to another meaning is present for the time being and whether or not such colors shall suffice to produce meaning depends upon whether or not the behavior of colors fulfils either an implicit or an explicit Aufgabe Thus in our last experiment colors sufficed not in themselves but because they united the letters of the word good into the word good This union of colors satisfied the Aufgabe In introspection I3 the behavior of colors did not satisfy the Aufgabe for it led neither to a further change in colors nor to a bodily relaxation Hence the colors meant nothing To return then to a comparison of W and A W habitually fulfils Aufgaben by resorting to complex motor at titudes along with changing visual auditory and other imagery A can fulfill the same tasks by juggling visual contents and with less kinaesthesis But the instant visual synaesthetic contents cease to flow As motor responses come at once to the rescue 382SYNAESTHESIA AND MEANING We can conclude therefore that the behavior of synaesthetic phenomena in our synaesthetic reagent is an adequate substitute in focal consciousness for the motor responses which were more important in our check reagent But our synaesthetic reagent must have motor responses constantly on tap in a case of emergency A careful examination of his introspective data shows that such motor responses are constantly on tap as a dim and oftentimes unnoticed background He attends to changes in synaesthetic phenomena as long as they run their course but if these synaesthetic images fail to run their course he becomes conscious at once of the failure of the motor back ground to run its course as well As mental life is character ized by a synaesthetic tendency to see everything The motor background which develops with the growth of mean ing and which came to the front so many times in Ws introspections is not noticed by A for the same reason that auditory or tactual processes are not noticed Visual surro gates symbolize them all So A is overdetermined or predis posed to find meaning in his synaesthetic images rather than in motor adjustments in the same fashion as he is overdeter mined or predisposed to see sounds rather than to hear them But just as auditory qualities in his colored hearing determine the behavior of the visual associate and operate as a necessary background so in the development of meaning the motor attitude is a necessary background for the behavior of detached synaesthetic images It is because the reagent is attending to visual rather than to auditory qualities when he hears sounds that it seems as if he were seeing sounds rather than hearing them It is be cause his attention is centered upon visual qualities when he calls up auditory imagery of a sound that makes it seem to the reagent that he has auditory imagery when in reality no audi tory qualities are present And because his attention is cen tered upon shifting visual contents as meaning develops rather than centered upon motor contents he finds meaning in the former rather than in the latter In every instance the process attendedto is the one which the reagent interprets as the bearer of the meaning In every instance the last process attendedto the last to run its courseis interpreted to be the content of the process of recognizing the preceding content Hence A finds meanings in motor attitudes only when visual accompaniments cease or when a motor response terminates a given series of experiences All of this is illustrated by introspection 13 While the asynaesthetic reagent would probably have interpreted his motor attitudes as concerned with the development of meaning as did W A interpreted his motor responses as having to do 383WHEELER AND CUTSFORTH with fulfilling the Aufgabe they meant expectation or com pletion of the task Had colors not dominated As conscious ness it is most likely that his bodily relaxation at the end of the experiment would have meant the core of his recognizing the word good and would have been a response to the vocal motor image good As it was however the merging of the colors was the core of his recognitionprocess and the accom panying motor attitude which did not claim his attention until afterward was interpreted as a fulfilment of the task not as a reaction which had to do with recognizing the word good Since the recognition of the word good was the fulfilment of the task recognizing and fulfilling a task are here identical W would have chosen the first meaning of the two A chose the second because he is synaesthetic and the behavior of his synaesthetic imagery meant the process of recognizing Hence the motor response meant something else In Ws case the motor attitude would have meant both on second thought 5 CONCLUSIONS The real cognitive function of synaesthetic phenomena now becomes apparent for i the appearance of colors in the first place constitutes developing auditory or tactual perceptions on the one hand and 2 the further behavior of these colors constitutes shifts from one meaning to another as for example trom lettermeanings to wordmeanings 3 the behavior of these colors acts also as a surrogate for motor responses in focal consciousness as long as the motor phenomena are present as an unnoticed background 4 synaesthetic phenomena be have in such fashion that they can mean the fulfilment of a task 5 meanings fail to develop in the absence of the appro priate behavior of synaesthetic colors 6 synaesthetic imagery constitutes the context for meaning 7 synaesthetic images operate as a substitute for feelings of familiarity and 8 syn aesthetic images label or interpret the object making it meaningful It is significant to note that in no instance did meaning de velop for any reagent until a motor attitude or visualized motor attitude attended other sensory or imaginal contents This fact suspiciously points to the conclusion not only that kin aesthesis is an essential component of the consciousness of meaning but also that a motor response is necessary for the development of meaning 384

J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107345,AN ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT DERBYSHIRE DENUDATION,I206966,XIII AN ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT DERBYSHIRE DENUDATION BY MR JO FAREY SEN IN A LETTER TO THE RIGHT IION SIR JOSEPH BANKS BART K B P R S READ MARCH 21 1811 SIR 4 HAD BUT RECENTLY ENTERED ON THE SURVEY OF DERBYSHIRE AND ITS ENVIRONS WHICH UNDER YOUR KIND PATRONAGE I WAS INDUCED TO COMMENCE IN THE AUTUMN OF 1807 AND HAD ONLY CURSORILY EXA MINED THE STRATA IN MY WAY FROM CHARNWOOD FOREST AND BREE DON IN LEICESTERSHIRE IN ORDER TO MEET YOU AT OVERTON HALL BEFORE I PERCEIVED CLEARLY THAT THOSE PRINCIPLES WHICH CON TEMPLATE THE TERRESTRIAL STRATA AS TERMINATING OR ENDING IN ONE DIRECTION SIMPLE AND IMPORTANT AS THEY ARE WHICH I HAD LEARNED UNDER MR WILLIAM SMITH IN 1801 AND WHICH HE HAS SO SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED IN THE FILLING UP OF HIS MAPS OF THE STRATA IN THE SOUTHEAST AND EAST AND SOME OF THE MIDDLE PARTS OF ENGLAND WOULD FAIL ME IN THEIR APPLICATION TO THE STRATA OF DERBYSHIRE WITHOUT TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION ALONG WITH THEM NOT ONLY THE DENUDATION OR LOCAL STRIPPING OFF OF PATCHES OF STRATA SOME OF IMMENSE EXTENT AND THICKNESS AND EVEN MORE CONSIDERABLE THAN THOSE WHICH I HAD DISCOVERED TO BE MISSING  AND SUCH AS DR WILLIAM RICHARDSON HAD FOUND TO HAVE BEEN REMOVED IN SEVERAL PLACES FROM OFF THE BASALTIC AREA IN THE COUNTIES OF DERRY AND ANTRIM IN IRE LAND AND HAS NAMED ABRUPTIONS IN HIS VERY ADMIRABLE PAPER ON THIS DISTRICT IN THO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS FOR I8O8MR FAREYS ACOUNT C  FROM OFF THE WEALDS OF KENT SUSSEX AND SURRY AND HAD EX PLAINED TO YOU BY A ROUGH SECTION ACROSS THIS GREAT SOUTHERN DENUDATION IN 1806 AND SUCH AS THE VALLEY OF ASHOVER THEN APPEARED TO PRESENT A MORE PERFECT INSTANCE OF AROUND US BUT THAT PREVIOUSLY TO SUCH DENUDATIONS OF THE DERBYSHIRE STRATA IMMENSE DISLOCATIONS OR VERTICAL DERANGEMENTS OF VERY LARGE PILES OF STRATA SEPARATED BY THE FISSURES CALLEDFAULTS BY THE MINERS NEEDED ALSO TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT FOR EXPLAIN ING THE APPEARANCES OF THE STRATA AND SURFACE OF THE DISTRICT WHICH I WAS THEN ABOUT TO EXPLORE FAULTS EXCEEDING IM MENSELY IN THEIR EXTENT AND QUANTITY OF LIFT ON ONE SIDE OR SINK ON THE OTHER ANY WHICH HAD OCCURRED TO MR SMITH IN THIE TRACING OF THE SOUTHEASTERN STRATA OF ENGLAND WHERE NO FAULTS HAD BEEN DISCOVERED SO CONSIDERABLE AS TO CUT OFF EN TIRELY THE CONNECTION OF THE STRATA OR IN OTHER WORDS TO BRING STRATA IN CONTACT ON THE SURFACE WHOSE PLACES IN THE SERIES WERE TOO DISTANT TO BE KNOWN AND READILY TRACED IN THEIR ORDER IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND IN CONSEQUENCE I JUDGED IT NE CESSARY ON MY RETURN TO TOWN WHEN THE WINTER ARRIVED TO SET ABOUT THE CONSIDERATION OF STRATIFIED MASSES BROKEN AND DISLOCATED AND THEN CUT OR DENUDATED IN ALL THE VARIETY OF CASES AND DEGREES OF EACH THE RESULTS OF WHICH INVESTIGATION WILL APPEAR IN MY REPORT TO THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ON DERBY SHIRE THE FIRST VOLUME OF WHICH IS NOW IN THE PRESS WITH IDEAS THUS EXTENDED I FOUND ON RESUMING MY SURVEY IN THE SPRING OF 1808 THAT SOME CONCLUSIONS THAT I HAD FORMED AND HAD UNFORTUNATELY COMMITTED TO PAPER IN A SKETCH OF A SECTION ACROSS THE COUNTY WERE ERRONEOUS AND THAT IMMENSE FAULTS OCCURRED IN PLACES WHERE THEIR EXISTENCE HAD NOT BEEN PROVED BY MINERS OR GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD WHICH COMBINED LI2 9343MR FAREYS ACCOUNT OF WITH THE DENUDATIONS THAT WERE SO APPARENT IN MY FIRST JOURNEY ACROSS THE COUNTY IN THE PRECEDING AUTUMN OFFERED AS I PRO CEEDED AFTERWARDS IN FILLING UP MY MAP A CONSIDERABLY DIFFE RENT EXPLANATION OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE COUNTY OR SECTION OF ITS STRATA FROM THAT WHICH I HAD PREVIOUSLY MADE AND PER MITTED SOME PERSONS TO COPY THE FIRST VOLUME OF MY REPORT TO THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ABOVEMENTIONED HAS COMPRESSED INTO IT ALL THE MOST ESSENTIAL PARTICULARS OF MY SURVEY WHICH MANUSCRIPT YOU DID ME THE HONOUR TO EXAMINE AND TO RECOM MEND ITS ADOPTION TO THE BOARD BUT AS THE PLAN OF THAT RE PORT DID NOT ADMIT OF TAKING AN EXTENDED OR CONNECTED VIEW OF THE GREAT FAULTS OR DISLOCATIONS OF THE DISTRICT I HAVE TROUBLED YOU WITH THIS LETTER IN ORDER TO DESCRIBE THEM PREVIOUS TO WHICH IT MAY BE RIGHT JUST TO RECALL TO YOUR RECOLLECTION A FEW PARTICULARS RESPECTING THE BRITISH STRATIFICATION IT IS NOW WELL KNOWN TO GREAT NUMBERS OF OBSERVERS THAT THE THICK CLAY AND OTHER STRATA ON WHICH THE METROPOLIS IS SITUATED EXTEND EAST WARD THROUGH ESSEX SUFFOLK AND NORFOLK TO THE EASTERN COAST AND IN ALL THEIR EXTENT COVER THE CHALK STRATA THAT THESE AGAIN THE CHALK EXTEND FROM THE ISLE OF WIGHT TO FLAMBOROUGH HEAD AND COVER OTHER KNOWN STRATA WHICH HAVE THEIR REGULAR BASSETEDGES OR APPEARANCES AT THE SURFACE IN CONTINUITY TO THE WESTWARD OF THE LIMITS OF THE CHALK AND OF EACH OTHER AND THUS IT HAS BEEN IMAGINED BY MANY THAT THE WHOLE SURFACE OF ENG LAND COULD BE REFERRED TO OR EXPLAINED BY AN UNINTERRUPTED SERIES OF BASSETEDGES OF STRATA DIPPING TO THE SE AND RANG ING IN CONTINUITY FROM SW TO NE IN CERTAIN UNDULATING LINES CONFORMABLE TO THE SURFACE FROM ONE SEA TO THE OTHER JUST AS A CERTAIN NUMBER AT THE UPPER PART OF THE SERIES HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO DO BY MR SMITHS MANUSCRIPT MAPS BUT AFTER 244THE GREAT DERBYSHIRE DENUDATION 45 PASSING THE EDGES OF THE LIAS LIMESTONES AND CLAY STRATA IN OUR PROGRESS TO THE WESTWARD FROM ANY OF THE SOUTHEASTERN AND EASTERN PARTS OF ENGLAND WE FIND ON THE SURFACE MARKS OF AN IMMENSE STRATUM OF RED EARTH OR MARLE WHICH BASSETING FRONM UNDER THE LIAS CLAY AND SAND SEEMS ONCE TO HAVE EXTENDED OVER ALL THE REMAINDER OF THE BRITISH ISLANDS WITHOUT BEING NOW ANY WHERE COVERED BY PATCHES OF UPPER STRATA MUCH BE YOND THE CONTINUOUS EDGE OF THE LIAS STRATA ABOVEMENTIONED INSTEAD HOWEVER OF SEEING THE MIDDLE AND ALL THE WESTERN AND NORTHERN PARTS OF BRITAIN COVERED BY THE SAME RED STRATA WE FIND NOW IN THIS SPACE NUMEROUS LOCAL AND MANY VERY LARGE TRACTS OF STRATA SURROUNDED BY VERTICAL AND CONNECTED FAULTS AND GREATLY LIFTED AND TILTED FROM THE SURFACE OF WHICH LIFTED TRACTS THE UPPER RED EARTH AND VAST AND VERY UNEQUAL THICKNESSES OF STRATA THAT LAY IN REGULAR SUCCESSION BELOW THIS RED EARTH HAVE BEEN DENUDATED  ABRUPTED OR CARRIED OFF LEAVING THUS A GREAT VARIETY OF WHAT HAVE BEEN CALLED COALFIELDS OR MINERALBASINS IN WHICH LIMITED TRACTS GREAT AND MOST IMPORTANT SERIES OF STRATA ARE TO BE SEEN BAS SETING OWING TO THE LOCAL DENUDATIONS OF WHICH THE BASSET EDGES OR CONTINUED ENDINGS CAN NO WHERE BE TRACED IN THESE ISLANDS AS FAR AS I CAN LEARN LARGE TRACTS OF THE INTERVENING SPACES BETWEEN THESE DENUDATED MINERAL BASINS ARE STILL OC CUPIED BY THE RED MARLE CONTAINING LOCAL STRATA OF GYPSUM ROCKSALT SAND MICACEOUS GRITSTONE C C IN ITS SUBSTANCE OR EXPOSED BY DENUDATION AND IN OTHERS LOCAL STRATA OR  GRAVELS PEAT C NOT BEING INCLUDED IN THIS TERM T OF WHICH A FINE INSTANCE IS DESCRIBED BY MR EDWARD MARTIN IN THE PHILO SOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS FOR 18O8 AND OF WHICH THE FOREST OF DEAN PRESENTS A SMALLER BUT SIMILAR INSTANCEMR FAREYS ACCOUNT OF 246 NODUIES OF GREAT EXTENT OR RATHER PERHAPS RUDELY CRYSTALLIZED NMASSES OF SLATE GREENSTONE SIENITE BASALT C C FORMING HILLS OR MOUNTAINS OFTEN INTERSECTED BY MINERAL VEINS FROM THE TOPS OF WHICH MASSES THE RED MARLE HAS IN MOST INSTANCES BEEN DENUDATED IT REMAINS A TASK OF GREAT DIFFICULTY YET TO BE ACCOMPLISHED TO ASCERTAIN THE LOWER PART OF THE BRITISH SERIES OF STRATA THUS ONLY EXPOSED TO VIEW IN LOCAL AND UNCON ECTED TRACTS OR BASINS WHICH ARE IN PART OFTEN CONCEALED BY GRAVEL FREQUENTLY SO NEAR THEIR BORDERS AND TOWARDS WHICH INVESTIGATION LITTLE HAS YET BEEN DONE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE ARE THREE DISTINCT SERIES OF COALMEASURES IF NOT MORE SEPARATED BY THICK STRATA OF RED EARTHS OR MARLES NOT EASILY DISTINGUISHED FROM THE UPPER ONE ABOVE THE COAL SERIES OR THAT WHICH UNDERLAYS THE LIAS STRATA AS ABOVEMENTIONED AND BY THICK STRATA OF LIMESTONES EACH OF WHICH RED EARTHS PRO BABLY PRODUCE ANOMALOUS AND LOCAL STRATA OR CRYSTALLIZED MOUNTAIN MASSES IN DIFFERENT PLACES WHERE THEY FORM THE SURFACE AND THE FACT OF SUCH CONTAINING NO ORGANIC REMAINS MAY NOT HAVE ARISEN FROM THEIR HAVING BEEN FORMED BEFORE ORGANIZED BEINGS EXISTED AS THOSE CONTEND WHO CALL THEM PRIMITIVE ROCKS BUT BECAUSE THE CIRCUMSTANCES PROPER TO CRYS TALLIZATION WERE UNFITTED TO THE PROPAGATION AND LIFE OF EITHER ANIMALS OR VEGETABLES AND MAY IT NOT BE DOUBTED WHETHER CRYSTALLIZED MASSES GREAT OR SMALL ARE EVER THE SEATS OF RE LIQUIA  THE NORTHERN PART OF DERBYSHIRE AND THE ADJOINING PARTS OF THE SURROUNDING COUNTIES PRESENT A DENUDATED TRACT AND PARTAKE OF THIS UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHAT PLACE IN THE LOWER PART OF THE BRITISH SERIES OF STRATA ITS STRATA SHOULD BE REFERRED FROM MANY CIRCUMSTANCES I AM INCLINED TO CONSIDER THE COALTHE GREAT DERBYSHIRE DENUDATION 27 FIELD OF DERBYSHIRE NOTTINGHAMSHIRE AND YORKSHIRE UNDER LAYING THE YELLOWLIME ROCK AS LOWER IN THE SERIES THAN ANY OTHERS OF THE COALMEASURES ALLUDED TO ABOVE DTHA TT THE FOURTH LIMESTONE ROCK WHICH EXTENDS FROM CASTLETON IN DER BYSHIRE SOUTHWARD TO WEAVER HILL NEAR WOOTON AND RA MSOR IN STAFFORDSHIRE IS THE VERY LOWEST WHICH IS KNOWN IN BRITAIN AND WHICH MAY ACCOUNT FOR THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THE MINERAL VEINS AND THE STRATA IN WHICH THEY OCCUR IN DERBYSHIRE PRE SENT SOME PHENOMENA WHICH ARE SAID TO OCCUR NO WHERE ELSE I SHALL PROCEED NOW TO DESCRIBE THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THIS GREAT ELEVATION AND DENUDATIONOF PART OF THE DER BYSHIRE STRATA SEEMS TO HAVE HAPPENED WHICH IS BY A SERIES OF THREE OR FOUR SEPARATELY LIFTED TRACTS ONE WITHIN THE OTHER AS REPRESENTED IN THE SMALL SKETCH MAP ANNEXED THE OUTER OR LEAST LIFTED OF THESE TRACTS IS BOUNDED ON THE SOUTH BY A FAULT THAT I HAVE DISTINGUISHED BY A FULL LINE WHERE ASCER TAINED AND BY SLIGHT DOTS WHERE ONLY INFERRED AND DENOMI NATED IT THE GREAT DERBYSHIRE FAULT WHICH IS PERFECTLY DEFINED FROM NEAR NOTTINGHAM ACROSS DERBYSLLIRE TO THE NORTH SIDE OF STONE IN STAFFORDSHIRE EXCEPT IN A FEW PLACES WHERE GRAVEL COVERS IT BY HAVING RED MARLE LYING NEARLY HORIZONTAL ON ALL ITS SOUTH SIDE AND DIFFERENT STRATA ON ITS NORTH SIDE AS WILL BE MENTIONED FURTHER ON THE EASTERN FAULT OR SIDE OF THIS FIRST RAISED TRACT IS NOT VISIBLE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF MY SURVEY LIKE THE SOUTHERN ON ACCOUNT OF THE VAST ACCUMULATION OF QUARTZ GRAVEL IN SHERWOOD FOREST AND THE PEATY ALLUVIA NORTH OF IT BUT IT SEEMS PROBABLE TO ME THAT ITS RANGE IS FROM ABOUT THE TOWN OF NOTTINGHAM EAST OF MANSFIELD EAST OF WORKSOP NEAR BAWTRY WEST OF THORNE IN YORKSHIRE AND HOW MUCH FURTHER248 MR FAREYS ACCOUNT OF NORTH THIS FAULT PROCEEDS BEFORE IT TURNS TO THE WEST I AM UNABLE TO STATE FROM MY OWN OBSERVATIONS BUT FROM THE COR RESPONDENCE OF MY FRIEND WILLIAM SMITHSON ESQ OF HEATH HALL NEAR WAKEFIELD A VERY ABLE OBSERVER I CONCLUDE THAT THE BOUNDARY FAULT ON THE NORTH OF THE OUTER LIFTED TRACT RANGING NOT FAR FROM THE LOWER PART OF THE COURSE OF THE WHARF RIVER SUDDENLY CUTS OFF OR TERMINATES THE GREAT DERBYSHIRE AND YORKSHIRE COALFIELD TO THE NORTH AND CONTINUES S OF OTLEY AND KEIGHLEY  NEAR COLNE IN LANCASHIRE AND CLITHEROE BOUNDING STILL THE COALFIELD OF LANCASHIRE TO THE NORTH I AM NOT SUFFICIENTLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE LANCASHIRE STRATA TO HAZARD A CONJECTURE AS TO WHERE THIS FAULT TURNS OR BRANCHES PER HAPS TOWARDS THE SOUTHWARD AGAIN BUT ON THE WEST IT PRO BABLY PASSES NOT FAR FROM MANCHESTER STOCKPORT IN CHESHIRE MACCLESFIELD CONGLETON CHURCHLAWTON SALTWORKS AND JOINS THE GREAT DERBYSHIRE FAULT OR SOUTHERN BOUNDARY OF THIS VERY LARGE RAISED TRACT SOMEWHERE TO THE NW OF STONE IN STAF FORDSHIRE AS I JUDGE FROM THE INFORMATION WHICH I HAVE RE CEIVED OF THE RED MARLE OCCUPYING THE SURFACE WITHOUTSIDE THIS RAISED TRACT TO THE WESTWARD IN CHESHIRE AND STAFFORDSHIRE  IT SEEMS PROBABLE FROM THE ACCOUNTS WHICH I HAVE RECEIVED FROM MR SM ITHSO  OF THE MANY SMALL COALBASINS OR SWILLEYS AS THEY ARE CALLED WHICH OCCUR IN THE SPACE BETWEEN KEIGHLEY HAWES AND RICHMOND VIZ ON THE N SIDE OF KEIGHLEY ON FOUNTAIN FELL IN CRAVEN THORPE FELL NEAR BURNSALL THRESHFIELD NEAR LINTON AND ANTER HEIGHTS NEAR KETTLEWELL ON THE WHARF RIVER NETHERDALE FOREST NEAR MIDDLESMOOR ON THE NIDD RIVER SLAPESTONES NEAR HAWES WESTSCRAFTON SW LEYBURN NW AND BRAITHWAITBANK NEAR TO MIDDLEHAM ON THE YORE RIVER HUDSWELL MOOR SW OF RICH MOND ON THE SWALE RIVER C THAT ALL THESE BELONG TO THE LOWER OR CALCAREOUS PART OF THE NEWCASTLE COAL SERIES AS EXHIBITED IN MR WS T G ARTH FORST

AND NOT TINGHAMSHIRE AS ABOVEMENTIONED AND ON THE EAST OF IT FROM NOTTINGHAM TO THORNE IN YORKSHIRE AND PERHAPS FURTHER NORTHWARD THIS BORDER OR PLAIN OF RED MARLE HAS THE TRACT WITHIN IT SO RAISED THAT THE YELLOW OR MAGNESIAN LIME ROCK PROBABLY ABUTS AGAINST THE MARLE AT THE SURFACE OF THE STRATA ON THE EAST SIDE UNDER THE GRAVEL C FROM NEAR NOTTINGHAM TO NEAR WETHERBY IN YORKSHIRE FROM LENTON E OF NOTTINGHAM TO ALLESTRY N OF DERBY THE UPPER PARTS OF THE COALMEASURES IN THE FIRST RAISED TRACT ABUT ON THE RED MARLE HERE ANOTHER GREAT FAULT CALLED THE ZIGZAG FAULT INTERSECTS THE BOUNDARY FAULT FROM ALLESTRY TO THE SE CORNER OF THE WEAVER HILLS NEAR WOOTON IN STAFFORDSHIRE THE SECOND INNER TRACT WITH A VASTLY GREATER RISE THAN THE FIRST ABUTS ON THIS SOUTHERN FAULT SO AS TO BRING THE GREAT LIMESTONESHALE WHICH UNDERLAYS ALL THE COALMEASURES AGAINST THE RED MARLE ON THE SURFACE AT THIS SE CORNER OF THE WEAVER HILLS ANOTHER GREAT FAULT CALLED THE GREAT LIMESTONE FAULT INTERSECTS THE SOUTHERN BOUNDARY OR GREAT DERBYSHIRE FAULT OF THE RAISED TRACT AND FROM THIS PLACE TO THE SW CORNER OF THE WEAVER HILLS NEAR RAMSOR A THIRD INNER TRACT WITH FOUR HUNDRED YARDS OR MORE OF PERPENDICULAR RISE IN ADDITION TO THE LAST OCCASIONS THE FOURTH OR LOWEST LIMESTONE ROCK TO ABUT AGAINST AND EVEN MAKE A HIGH HILL ABOVE THE RED MARLE AT THE FOOT OF IT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF TTHE GREAT DERBYSHIRE FAULT WHICH HERE OCCA SIONS A SUDDEN DERANGEMENT OF THE STRATA AND A CORRESPOND ING DENUDATION OF THE LARGE TRACT OF COUNTRY TO THE NORTHWARD HAS TAKEN PLACE FAR EXCEEDING ANY THING WHICH

THE SOUTH BOUNDARY OR GREAT DERBYSHIRE FAULT AND PROCEEDS NORTHWARD AFTER WHICH A CORNER OF THE SECOND INTERIOR RAISED TRACT AGAIN PRESENTS IT SELF AND THE LIMESTONESHALE AGAIN ABUTS ON THE MARLE AS WE PURSUE THE GREAT DERBYSHIRE FAULT TO THE WESTWARD OWING TO THE RISE BEING LESS HERE BY FOUR OR FIVE HUNDRED YARDS THAN IT WAS IN THE THIRD INTERIOR TRACT BUT AS WE PROCEED SOUTH WESTWARD OWING TO THE DIP OF THE MEASURES ON THE N SIDE OF THE GREAT DERBYSHIRE FAULT TOWARDS THE WEST THE FIRST GRIT THE FIRST COALSHALE AND THE SECOND GRIT ROCK SUCCESSIVELY ABUT AGAINST THE MARLE BEFORE THE GRAVEL COVERING COMMENCES EAST AND SOUTH OF CHEADLE WHICH PREVENTED MY TRACING THIS FAULT ANY FURTHER WITHIN THE LIMITS OF MY SURVEY IT SEEMS PROBABLE HOWEVER THAT SOMEWHERE SW OF CHEA DLE IN STAFFORDSHIRE A BRANCH SETS OFF FROM THE GREAT DERBY SHIRE FAULT OR SOUTHERN BOUNDARY OF THE LIFTED TRACTS AND PROCEEDS NORTHWARD NEAR TO ENDON AND BOSLEY IN CHESHIRE THE TRIANGULAR TRACT BEYOND WHICH TO THE WESTWARD SHEWN IN THE MAP FORMING THE POTTERY COALFIELD IS MUCH LESS RAISED PERHAPS THAN ANY OF THE OTHER TRACTS WHICH HAVE BEEN HERE MENTIONED IF WE RETURN TO ALLESTRY N OF DERBY ABOVEMENTIONED AND TRACE THE

W BUT THE RISE IS VERY CONSIDERABLE AND UNEQUAL ON THE N AND W SIDES THROUGH ITS WHOLE LENGTH COMPARED WITH THE OTHER SIDES AS I HAVE PARTICULARLY SHEWN IN MY REPORT TO THE BOARD AND POINTED OUT THE GREAT DIFFICULTIES WHICH THIS ZIGZAG FAULT HAS PRESENTED TO THE RIGHT UNDERSTANDING THE ENTIRE OF THE GREAT DERBYSHIRE AND YORKSHIRE COALFIELD BY THE MANY VERY INTELLIGENT AND ABLE COLLIERS WHO ARE

INCON SIDERABLE TO BE READILY TRACED OWING TO ITS NO LONGER DERANG ING THE ORDER OF THE STRATA ON THE SURFACE BUT LIAS THE FIRST LIMESTONE ON BOTH ITS SIDES AND THUS IT HAPPENS THAT THE THIRD INNER RAISED TRACT OR MINERALFIELD CONSISTING OF THE FOUR LIMESTONE ROCKS AND THREE INTERPOSED TOADSTONES AND CONTAIN ING ABOUT 105000 ACRES HAS ABOUT 515OO ACRES OF THESE ON ITS EASTERN SIDE OCCUPIED BY THE THREE UPPER LIMESTONES AND THE TOADSTONES AND THE REMAINING 535O0 ACRES IN DERBYSHIRE AND STAFFORDSHIRE IS OCCUPIED BY THE FOURTH OR LOWEST LIME STONE ROCK IN WHICH ONLY A FEW MINERAL VEINS OCCUR AMONG ITS NUMEROUS OPEN FISSURES AND CAVERNS IN THE SKETCH MAP WHICH ACCOMPANIES THIS I HAVE SHEWN A SMALLER OR FOURTH INNER RAISED TRACT ON WHICH BAKEWELL IS SITUATED IN GREAT PART SURROUNDED BY A FAULT WHICH I HAVE251 MR FAREYS ACCOUNT OF THENCE DENOMINATED THE GREAT BAKEWELL FAULT I HAVE SELECTED THIS TRACT AMONG OTHER SMALL LOCAL RAISED ONES ON ACCOUNT OF ITS APPROACHING IN SHAPE AND POSITION TO THE OTHERS WHICH SURROUND IT AND BECAUSE IT EXPLAINS SEVERAL CURIOUS APPEAR ANCES OF THE STRATA IN THESE PARTS WHICH HAVE BEEN AND ARE STILL LIKELY TO BE GREATLY MISREPRESENTED THE FAULT TO WHICH I ALLUDE MAY BE SAID TO COMMENCE IN THE LIMESTONESHALE ON THE E SIDE OF BEELEY TO PASS ON THE S SIDE OF THE VILLAGE ACROSS THE DERWENT AND ON THE S OF HADDON HALL CONTINUING ACROSS THE PASTURES TO THE LATHKIL RIVER ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE ABOVE ALPORT THEN TURNS S PAST THE W END OF ALPORT TO THE UPPER MILL THENCE WSW FOR ABOUT ONE MILE WHERE THIS FAULT AGAIN TURNS TO THE N AND CROSSES THE BRADFORD RIVER AND PROCEEDING ACROSS THE MEADOWPLACE LIBERTY CROSSES ROBINSTYE MINE AND THE LATHKIL RIVER ABOVE OVERHADDON MILL BEARS THEN A LITTLE TO THE EAST OF THE NORTH AND CROSSES THE

TOWARDS NETHER BURCHILL THEN NE FOLLOWING NEARLY THE COURSE OF THE BROOK IT CONTINUES THE SAME DIRECTION UNTIL ABOUTHALF A MILE E OF HASSOP WHERE IT TURNS TO THE E CROSSES THE DERWENT AGAIN HALF A MILE ABOVE BASLOW AND TERMINATES IN THE LIMESTONESHALE IN BARBROOK DALE AS IT BEGAN THE WESTERN SIDE OF THIS FOURTH INNER TRACT BEING MOST RAISED SIMILAR TO THE THIRD TRACT OCCASIONS THE GREAT ELEVATION OF THE SHALE AND ITS FREE STONE IN THE HILLS E OF BAKEWELL AND NE OF HADDONHAIL THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF THE LIMESTONE ON WHICH HADDON HALL STANDS AND IN THE QUARRY SSW OF IT ON THEE W OF THETHE GREAT DERBYSHIRE DENUDATION ROAD AND THENCE ACROSS THE PASTURES TO THE LATHKIL RIVER THE SUDDEN ELEVATION OF THE LIMESTONE KNOWLS SW OF YOLGRAVE NEAR THE SHALE AND BY THIS SAME LIFT IT HAPPENS THAT THE VALE OF THE BRADFORD SUDDENLY CUTS THROUGH THE FIRST LIME ROCK AS SOON AS IT HAS CROSSED THIS FAULT AND SHEWS THE FIRST TOADSTONE TO A CONSIDERABLE HEIGHT UP EACH SIDE OF THE VALLEY BUT WHICH DECLINES WITH THE DIP OF THE MEASURES IN THIS TRACT UNTIL THE BRADFORD AGAIN GETS UPON THE FIRST TOADSTONE AND THEN ON THE FIRST LIMESTONE IN LIKE MANNER THE GREATER RISE OF THE MEA SURES AT THIS FAULT ON THE SW OF OVERHADDON VILLAGE OCCA SIONS THE VALLEY OF THE LATHKIL RIVER WHICH TILL THEN HAD BEEN EXCAVATED IN THE FIRST LIME ROCK TO ENTER ABRUPTLY SO DEEP INTO THE FIRST TOADSTONE AS TO LAY BARE A PATCH OF THE SECOND LIMESTONE UNDER IT IN THE RIVER BOTH OF WHICH HOWEVER DE SCEND AGAIN BELOW THE BED OF THE RIVER BEFORE WE GET DOWN TO THE CROSSING OF THE ASHBURNE TURNPIKE ROAD THIS FAULT ALSO OCCASIONS THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF SHALE LIMESTONE ON THE SURFACE NW OF IT OPPOSITE TO FIRST LIMESTONE ON THE OTHER SIDE IN BAKEWELL FIELDS AND OF THE FIRST TOAD STONE ON THE NW OF BAKEWELL COTTONMILL ALMOST EXCAVATED THROUGH BY THE VALE OF THE WYE RIVER WHERE IT ABUTS AGAINST SHALE OR SHALELIMESTONE AT THE NORTHERN END OF THIS NOTED PATCH OF TOADSTONE THE SITUATION AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHICH WHEN COMPARED WITH THOSE OF THE OTHER TWO PATCHES AT THE EDGE OF THIS SAME RAISED TRACT AS ABOVE WILL BE DIVESTED OF MUCLI OF THAT SINGULARITY WHICH HAS BEEN ASCRIBED TO IT FOR WE SEE THAT EACH OF THE THREE RIVERS WHICH PASS ON TO THIS FOURTH INNER RAISED TRACT HAVE THEIR EXCAVATIONS CUT THROUGH THE FIRST LIMESTONE SO AS TO EXPOSE THE FIRST TOADSTONE FOR SOME DISTANCE UNTIL THE MORE RAPID

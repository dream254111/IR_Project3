defendant so far as the public is concerned as immaterial in determining the right of the complainants to relief It has been held that property in a trademark will pass by operation of law to one who takes the right to manufacture the merchandise to which the trademark has attached Dixon Crucible Co v Guggenheim 2 Brewst 321 Further that an assignment of a business with the debts and plant includes trademarks and gives the assignee the exclusive right thereto Morgan v Rogers 19 Fed 596 Thus by analogy the dissenting opinion would seem to carry with it the support of what decisions may be applied under the peculiar circumstances involved And indeed since the complain ants might have retained their former trademark in Spain it is difficult to substantiate their right to an injunction upon any ground as the rule has frequently been applied in such cases that the voluntary relinquish ment of an old device for a new forfeits the right to the old Manhattan Medicine Co v Wood Fed Cas No 9026 affirmed in Io8 U S 218 2 Sup Ct 436 TRUSTSDISPOSAL OF TRUST PROPERTYTRANSFER WITHOUT SALE NATURE AND ELEMENTS OF SALESLand was conveyed to an agricultural association in trust for use as exhibition grounds a part to be sold or dis posed of for meeting the expenses of the trust including expenses of litiga tion The trustees deeded part of the tract to B in payment for legal services Held that the power of disposition was not limited to a sale for cash even giving the word sale the strict definition of the code Mans field v District Agr Assn No 6 9go8  Cal  97 Pac I50 In 7 MICH L REV 78 there was noted the broad extension of the use of the word sale to include barter in the case of liquor transactions The principal case illustrates the more general use of the word in spite of the definition of the Cal Civ Code  1721 where sale is defined as an exchange of property for a money consideration The court says that al though the word sell itself in transactions touching personal property usually has reference to a pecuniary or money consideration yet courts have never hesitated to give the word a broader significance when the meaning of the law or of a private contract seemed to call for it and the much more generally accepted definition of a sale is the exchange of an interest in real or personal property for money or its equivalent This view is sustained in Roberts v Northern Pacific Ry Co 158 U S I where the court says that if certain persons had power to sell land for money there is noexpress provision of law that restricts them from selling for moneys worth The same liberal view of the word is sustained in Borland v Nevada Bank 99 Cal 89 and Howard v Harris 8 Allen Mass 297 Iowa v McFarland Io U S 47I says money or its equivalent The cases are very much divided in their definitions of the word some holding money necessary others a consideration simply and still others accepting various equivalents for money The American Sale of Goods Act as yet adopted in but few states adopts the more liberal interpretation of the word sale In 277MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW Sec I Art I a consideration called the price is necessary for a contract of sale and in Sec 9 Art 2 the act states that the price may be made payable in any personal property WILLSCONSTRUCTIONEECT OF SIUBSEQUENT CCHANGE OF JUDICIAL INTERPRTATIONTestator used certain language disposing of his real estate According to the settled construction given to such language by the courts at the time the will was made his daughters daughter took a vested remainder The courts have since determined that such language gives only a contingent estate Held that the rights of the beneficiaries are to be determined by the construction which the law would have given to the will when made Hood et al v Pennsylvania Society to Protect Children from Cruelty I908 Pa  70 Atl 845 Shall a will speak as of the date of the drafting thereof or as of the date of the death of the testator The courts and writers on the law of wills have been troubled in answering this question JARMAN WILLS Vol I 5th Am Ed 318 Chap X and cases cited therein At first sight this case seems to be directly in point upon this query but on closer examination it will be found only a phase of the broader subject but so closely allied thereto that an understanding of what the authorities have thought and said helps wonder fully in a discussion of the principles of law more directly involved JARMAN WILLS supra The chief interest here is found in the light which is thrown upon the evident desire of the courts to get back to the true rule of looking only to the testators actual intent In considering these facts the general principle of law that when a judicial decision is rendered the law is not presumed to be changed by it but to have been the same before as after although previous decisions have been to a different effect is met with To unqualifiedly accept this principle would not permit the rendition of the decision here reached The court in its decision did recognize the general principle of law but refused to apply it in the face of the well established cardinal principle of the law of wills to wit the intention of the testator must prevail This decision apparently stands alone among the reported cases in the courts of last resort There are however many cases which might be regarded as analogous in which a statutory change subsequent to the drafting and execution of a will and affecting rights of beneficaries thereunder is involved ROOD WILLS 402 aptly states the reason of law to be that a statute inaugurating some change in public policy ought not to be so applied as to disappoint persons who have had their wills drawn upon good legal advice and have not taken the pains to consult a lawyer every day afterwards till the time of their deaths to know whether the law has been changed This expression of what the law ought to be accords with the weight of judicial authority in both the American and English courts Quicks Executor v Quick 1870 21 N J Eq I3 Mander v Harris I884 27 Ch Div I66 54 L J Ch 143 5I L T N S 380 In re Swensons Estate 1893 55 Minn 300 56 N W 1115 and cases cited

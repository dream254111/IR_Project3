Cape for the Royal Society By Mr Bayley 1769 April 28 29 and 30 got the observatory and dwellinghouse built and instru ments on shore  May 1 Set up an oak plank 4 34 inches thick and 14 inches wide This plank was set a little more than 2 feet in the ground and well rammed with earth and stones so that it was very steady and firm to which I screwed the astronomical clock truly perpendicular by which means it was independant of the observatory and its shaking by the wind and set it going nearly with sidereal time  3 Set up the transit instrument nearly in the meridian  4 Examined the line of collimation of the quadrant and found it correct Examined the clock and found the pendulum to vibrate 112 on each side of nothing Here follow some corresponding altitudes of the Sun from which the going of the clock is determined Z D   h     0   6 27 13 23 34 37 42 22 Morning Suns upper limb 6130 20 58 6 13 30 5 48 Afternoon 5 57 0 14 31 23 8 Morning Suns upper limb 500 42 6 5 33 32 24 55

14h 0 41 or 9h 14 1 apparent time Venuss outer limb seemed to be in contact with the Suns limb but no light of that part of the Suns limb could be seen Venus be ing apparently joined to the Suns limb by a black ligament which gradually di minished in breadth and at 14h 1 36 or 9h 14 56 the Suns light broke through it and Venus and the Sun were to appearance perfect this was certain to about 10 or 15 seconds of time and the black ligament contracted itself so that Venus was considerably within the Suns limb suppose 120 th of her diameter During these observations the air was red and hazy and the Suns limb very tremu lous and the spots in the Sun very indistinct and Venus seemed very ill defined when on the Sun But a better idea will be formed of the bad appearance of Venus at the internal

micrometer These are a mean of 10 or 12 observations each The Value of the Scale of the Object Glass Micrometer was found as follows A base of 120 feet was carefully measured on level ice which was covered with frozen snow about half an inch thick with two 10 feet fir rods and the measure being taken four different times no one differed from any of the others so much as 110th of an inch But as the fir rods might not consist of 10 feet exactly of the same standard from which the micrometer scale was laid off I therefore took six inches between the fine points of a pair of compasses from the micrometer scale and by repeating this measure found the exact length of the fir rods in measures of the micrometer scale and thence corrected the length of the base found imme diately by the rods and reduced to the standard of the micrometer scale Perpendicularly over the base at one end was placed the center of the divided object glass and perpendicularly over the base at the other end a board was placed having its plane at d h b right angles with the base line white paper pasted on its upper part and at the height of the center of the object glass nearly above the horizon A was a strong black line drawn as A B  8 inches A g and A e being small e g B but equal distances from A by bringing e d and g h to coincide alter nately with A a the error of adjustment of the micrometer scale was a found and by separating the glasses till A a and B b made but one line from this separation the value of one extent of the micrometer scale was found by mak ing this proportion As the length of the base is to the length A B so is 206265 the number of seconds in an arch equal to the radius of a circle to a fourth number which will be the seconds of the angle measured by that opening of the glasses which is shewn by the micrometer scale and other angles will be in direct proportion to the respective measures whence the table was formed Z E N I T H D I S T A N C E S taken with an

Arcturus 71 1 09  Lyrae 71 0 486 Mean  71 0 470 From whence the latitude of the point of land called the North Cape is 71 10 north By a great many trials with a very good compass of Dr Knights construction I found the variation to be 6 degrees west and by a dipping needle I found by repeated trials the dip of the north end of the needle to be 79 degrees May 15 at 13h 14 P M apparent time or 1h 7 after high water by a mean of 7 obser vations I found the dip of the horizon of the sea from the observatory to be 12 18 Height of the barometer 2970 inches thermometer without 24 thermometer within 28 And May 20 at 7h 34 P M apparent time or 7h 33 after high water from a mean of 8 observations I found the dip  12 255 barometer 2970 inches thermometer with out 43 and within 40 Both these observations were made on the N N E point of the true compass During each of these observations the water was very smooth and the horizon clearI found it was high water at the full and change of the Moon at 3h 44 P M ap parent time at the Cape and by a series of observations I found the water to rise 8 feet 1 inch nearly perpendicular at the spring tides and at neap tides 6 feet 8 inches perpendi cular and the tides seemed to follow very regular as they ought to do when not disturbed by bad weather  June 8 I found the height of the observatory 140 feet 6 inches above low water mark A J O U R N

j100358,The School Review,1075731,The Present Trend in the Teaching of Mathematics,i244599,THE PRESENT TREND IN THE TEACHING OF MATHEMATICS H E SLAUGHT University of Chicago No recent educational movement is more remarkable in cer tain ways than the present deep and widespread interest in improving the teaching of mathematics which is manifest in the large and constantly increasing number of associations through out the country organized for this distinct purpose The movement is remarkable for the spontaneity of its incep tion and for the rapidity of its growth Fully a score of organi zations of mathematics teachers date their origin since 1900 among the largest of which are The Association of Mathematics Teachers of New England the Association of Mathematics Teachers of the Middle States and Maryland and the Central Association of Science and Mathematics Teachers of the Middle West An extended list of such associations together with their officers may be found in the October number of School Science and Mathematics Another remarkable feature of this movement is the fact that it is taking place in the face of what has perhaps been the most hopeless condition of inertia in modern educational history an inertia founded upon the complacent and widespread belief that mathematics is the one branch of the curriculum which stands forth in a substantially perfect crystallized form the teaching of which is an accomplished art based upon administer ing to the pupil through a long and continuous rigime properly dissected portions of doctrine and exercises But several things have happened in recent years For example that heterogeneous assemblage of unrelated topics known as college algebra which has long held sway as an orthodox course is now no longer offered in many colleges and universities It has been supplanted by a more rational course in which the elements of coordinate geometry are blended with the 690PRESENT TREND IN TEACHING OF MATHEMATICS 691 elements of the theory of equations so as to form a logical and practical extension of secondary algebra to the solution of numeri cal higher equations leaving the more technical topics for late consideration in more advanced work Even in firstclass techni cal schools some such modification is taking place not only with respect to college algebra but affecting a readjustment and uni fication of all the freshman and sophomore courses in mathe matics In the calculus great changes have taken place in the way of postponing to a later period the more theoretical portions and reading early in the course the higher applications especially in the realm of mechanics and physics In trigonometry also the interesting and practical applications are now made to precede rather than follow the greater part of the theory In all subjects graphic methods are coming to occupy a prominent place with respect to both theoretical and practical considerations In the field of secondary mathematics however the feeling of dissatisfaction is especially widespread judging from the ever increasing number of papers reports and discussions among the various associations These have largely been directed toward the teaching of algebra and the arraignment has been chiefly against the artificial character of the problems the preponder ance of manipulation of abstract symbols as over against concrete applications and the increasing tendency of the textbooks to force the recondite reasoning and theoretical side of the subject farther and farther down in the course so that the beginner becomes appalled discouraged and not infrequently over whelmed So far the trend of the discussions has been largely icono clastic but hopeful signs are now appearing that a period of constructive criticism has begun Two representative committees of the Mathematics Section of the Central Association of Science and Mathematics Teachers have been at work one on geometry and one on algebra each for a period of one year The geometry report in preliminary form was printed last summer and has been widely distributed and the algebra report in preliminary form is printed in the October num ber of School Science and Mathematics692 THE SCHOOL REVIEW These reports are to form the basis of discussion at the two sessions of the Mathematics Section of the Central Association in St Louis on November 29 and 30 No other topics are to be considered Every effort will be made to do constructive work in the way of practical suggestions for improving the pedagogy of these subjects in the schools Besides the chairman of the respective committees G W Greenwood of Dunbar Pa for the geometry and Charles Ammerman of St Louis Mo for the algebra the leading speakers will be Professor Florian Cajori of Colorado College

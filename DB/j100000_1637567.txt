depend on our knowledge of the atmosphere and our anticipation of its vagaries We have done wonders on land and sea on the mountains and underneath the oceans but we have scarcely begun to appreciate what we may do in the atmosphere We may not change its winds its rains and snows but we may learn to utilize them to advantage The investment of a half million dollars in one laboratory with its physicists and mathema ticians devoted to research in the physics and mechanics of the atmosphere would do for meteorology as much as the wonderful observa tory at Mount Wilson is doing for astronomy One hundred years ago James Smithson of England entrusted his fortune to the United States as executor of his will and from that evidence of his faith in America innumerable benefits have followed How long will it be before meteorology receives a corresponding attention  The state of New York has furnished such men as Myer from Buffalo Henry from Al bany Redfield from New Yorkeminent stu dents who died without realizing their fondest hopes Americans are profiting unconsciously by their labors in meteorology Will they not invest 1 per cent of their earnings in the pro motion of an institute devoted to mans prog ress in this important science They can do nothing better for humanity C ABBE MORE BOTANICAL ERRORS PROFESSOR NEWCOMBES communication en titled ProfeSsor Punnetts Error on page 442 of the present volume of SCIENCE prompts me to call attention to the fact that Punnett is not the only zoological writer who displays ignorance of elementary botanical facts Two books in common use in our universities ex hibit the same error as Mr Punnetts book One of these The First Principles of He redity by Dr Herbert contains the following exposition page 21  Among plants we find male and female germcells in all flowering speciesthe former the pollengrain being developed in the anther of the stamen of the flower the latter the ovule lying in the ovary to which the pistil leads Most flowers possess both sexual organs stamen as well as pistil    It will be sufficient to point out three of the patent misconceptions in this extract 1 the pollengrain and ovule are not germcells 2 the stigma or style not the pistil leads to the ovary which is itself part of the pistil 3 stamen and pistil are not sexual organs for they bear asexual spores The second work referred to is E Davenports Principles of Breeding On page 161 speaking of the ovum the writer says Its equivalent in plants is the ovule In the next paragraph the writer says that the spermatozoon is the functional equivalent of the pollen grain of plants The errors here involve the same misconception as in the first case but are less serious Botanists of course regret that the term ovary should have been wrongly applied to the sac which contains megasporangia but the usage seems to be here to stay and certain of our zoological brethren might well consult a dictionary when dealing with botanical topics M A CHRYSLER C WASHINGTON SCIENCE UNDER the above caption which is assumed to have depreciatory significance Wash ingtonian  who has spent nearly half a cen tury in scientific work under government auspices writes1 defending government scientists It is with pleasure that I endorse every statement of his article and in many cases I could add much more of commendation from my personal knowledge It is suggested that outsiders can help if they will to promote the ideal service hence I have attempted to define what depreciatory significance the above title might have in my mind and to suggest a remedy It seems to me that the difficulty is one of 1SCIENCE N S XXXIV 405 September 29 1911 SCIENCE 603N S VOL XXXIV No 879 coordination as far as the relation of indus trial organizations to government science is concerned arising from the fact that scien tists in the government bureaus often have no adequate knowledge of the industries af fected by the regulations which they are called upon to draw up and enforce and hence they are not in a position to properly distinguish between attempts to evade the law and real protests concerning unnecessar ily restrictive rulings Very few business concerns are engaged in anything com parable with the sugar trust frauds or would countenance anything of the kind yet  Wash ington scientists are apparently unduly influenced by such cases and do not appear to give sufficient thought to the thousands of concerns with whom they never have any trouble The remedy for this condition would ap pear to lie in the employment of a number of scientists in the executive work of the bureaus who have had adequate training in the indus tries affected in place of the present plan of selecting all scientists for government work from men who have devoted their entire previous time to theoretical study and teach ing In the ultimate analysis the industries of the country appear to be the financial founda tion upon which our government rests hence I would suggest that inhabitants of the struc ture occupying top floor front rooms should be a little more conservative in their treatment of this same foundation INDUSTRIAL ENGINEER THE METHODS OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGISTS To THE EDITOR OF SCIENCE American stu dents will welcome the views propounded by Dr Rivers in his presidential address before the Anthropological Section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science SCIENCE September 29 1911 Nevertheless were Dr Rivers telescopically gifted he would assuredly read nothing but amazement and surprise in the expression of American ethnologists eyes as they peruse his extra ordinary characterization of their activity as compared with that of their colleagues in other lands Dr Riverss paper is essentially a declara tion of independence from the traditional point of view of his compatriots who to use his own words have been inspired primarily by the idea of evolution founded on a psychol ogy common to mankind as a whole His own investigations in Melanesia have con verted Dr Rivers to the teachings of the geo graphical or ethnological school whose home past and present he finds in Germany He has arrived at the conclusion that a direct psychological interpretation of cultural phe nomena is impossible because it ignores the demonstrable blending of different cultures Psychological analysis he contends must be preceded by an ethnological analysis  if cultures are complex their analysis is a preliminary step which is necessary if specu lations concerning the evolution of human society its beliefs and practises are to rest on a firm foundation p 391 Apparently Dr Rivers has never met with any thing like such views in the writings of American ethnologists for among these he recognizes only either purely descriptive re corders of data concerning the Indians or writers who like Kroeber in his Classifica tory Systems of Relationship and like Goldenweiser in his Totemism an Analyti cal Study investigate social problems from a purely psychological point of view Now as early as 1895 Dr Boas was led by his study of mythology to an expression of opinion so closely resembling the recent utter ances of Dr Rivers that it is almost incon ceivable how the resemblance could fail to be noticed At the conclusion of his Indian ische Sagen von der nordpacifischen Kiiste Amerikas p 353 Boas emphatically pro tests against a direct interpretation of myths as expressions of universal ideas before in vestigating the historical and geographical causes conditioning the growth of mytholog ical tales A still more comprehensive state ment appears in the same writers Introduc tion to the Publications of the Jesup North Pacific Expedition Vol I 1898 604 SCIENCE

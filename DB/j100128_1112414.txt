relating to labor unions and no more difficult industrial legal problems are presented to the courts than those which arise out of disputes under trade agreements The sweep of conflicting political theories and changing economic systems from the XIIIth through the XVIIth Centuries to the present day has left the common law affect ing industrial matters today a clouded uncertain record It has a distinct color but little else The title of this branch of the law as even today carried in textbooks law encyclopedias and reported decisions illustrates this conclusion What more abhorrent title can be found in all of the reported law of former ages than Master and Servantthe terminology used to describe the legal relationship of active or absentee capital and the workers of industry In addition to the cases which have been decided in our courts as to the rights privileges and duties of trades unions and the few decisions relating to operations of employers associations the courts have naturally been resorted to in order to determine disputes arising out of the relationship between an individual employer and an in dividual employee Severance of employment has given rise to liti gation ranging from action for wages to pleas for injunctive relief prohibiting competitive employment by the discharged or resigned em ployee In the main however employment litigation has been concerned with punishment rather than reform Specific performance or com pliance with contracts is seldom within the purview of such court actions The demand is for damages or in other words punishment for infraction or breach of contract Our treatment of criminal cases has at last brought us to the position where the public mind is directed toward an emphasis on reform rather than punishment A similar attitude is imperative in the treatment of industrial civil cases It helps little to assess damages on employer or employee in cases in volving infraction of employment relationship Damages practically the sole language of our courts in socalled Master and Servant cases breed nothing but ill will and have neither the intention nor the result of effecting industrial peace To stretch our judicial machinery into a form where its operation would be flexible enough to decide industrial issues and adjust such differences is not possible by mere expansion of powers and func tions If the courts of the land are ever to be empowered with such functions other organs of extrajudicial industrial machinery estabCOLUMBIA LAW REVIEW lished outside and apart from our courts will first have to operate satisfactorily in an independent fashion After such continued opera tion it may well be that the power of our courts will be extended to cover such new industrial machinery But while the people have been possibly overdesirous to place tremendous additional adminis trative powers and functions on the state a natural restraint and timidity is evident when the extension of judicial functions is pro posed The creation of commissionsPublic Service Workmens Compensation City Planningand other quasijudicial boards points clearly to a desire to remove from rather than bestow upon the courts special functions and powers And the cause is that the judicial machinery established in this country for obvious reasons has proved inadequate to handle in an effective manner the mass of minor but consequential disputes arising between employers and employees The delays of procedure the lack of confidence in the judiciary and the practical compulsion of retain ing counsel have forced employers and unions to the establishment of their own judicial tribunals In industrial disputes time is of the essence for time often means the difference between employment and unemployment A dis charged employee can find no true relief in a suit for money damages especially when the decision will not be reached within a month and possibly not within a year Moreover most industrial quasilegal matters before the joining of issues involve what in fact though not in law are offsets or counterclaims A superintendent discharges a forewoman the workers in the shop stop work The contract clearly prohibits the forewomans discharge without hearing and notice and further is violated by the stoppage on the part of the workers Sure ly a revolution in our codes of practice would be necessary in order to bring before one judge in one action the superintendent the fore woman and the striking employees Nevertheless that very feat is easily performed under extrajudicial machinery established by work ers and employers in specific industries Under our codes of practice however the courts are prohibited from a consolidated hearing and trial on all correlated issues In addition the impartial standing of our judiciary is without meaning any disrespect correctly impugned There is a clean allign ment of most individuals either for or against dividends to persons other than those actively connected with industrial enterprises The members of the legal professionfrom whom the judiciary is select edmost naturally decline to look with any disapproval upon ethical or moral grounds on absentee profitsharing and conversely prob ably underemphasize the justice of the greater distribution of the profits of industry which labor and management increasingly claim from the share heretofore paid for invested capital Thus labor dis 156DEVELOPMENT OF INDUSTRIAL JURISPRUDENCE 157 trusts our courts which are truly colored with prejudgment of our economic life Little need be said of the outrageous costs of litigation and of the time wasted in sitting around waiting for trial Litigation may result in the doing of justice but it is far more a matching of wits than a sifting for truth Our rules limiting the admissibility of evi dence and the establishment of the judge as an impartial auditor rather than as a scientific investigator for truth make the use of our courts for complicated economic and human problems anything but an adequate forum Probably lack of time rather than danger of befogging issues still demands strict limitation of our rules as to admissible evidence Such rules however make trials a sport or game A lawyer untrained in this game may be unable to squeeze into the record material facts and conversely a skillful evidence sportsman can becloud the issues with immaterial facts The bar moreover hardly looks with due approval on those judges who take upon themselves the examination of witnesses Such action tends to divest the profession of the vested right of examination In pro portion to the intellects of the contestants the judges and the juries it is possible to place limitations on admissible evidence Trained ad vocates skilled jurors or learned judges grasp the kernel of a situation without hearing all the facts Untrained contestants on the other hand require elaborateness and even repetition of evidence So in actions arising out of industrial relations the broadest possible airing of grievances and practically a total lack of restraint on evidence become necessary in order to arrive at just decisions and in order to procure the valuable and proper education of the contestants In dustrial litigants in our courts are not so much aggrieved by failure to win a case as by a feeling of injustice having been done by refusal to listen to what to them are the salient facts Such and similar factors have caused a resort by employers and employees to an institution of their own making The development of these intraindustrial courts is in an early stage Until ten or twelve years ago if a semblance of industrial peace existed in a particular industry the machinery invoked for the settlement of disputes was an ordinary arbitration board consisting of representatives of each side who upon failure to agree were empowered to call in an additional impartial person Under such machinery it became evident that the representatives of the respective sides contributed little to a judicial determination of any dispute These representatives because of pres sure from their respective constituents assumed the roles of advocates The result was that the power of decision of any such tribunals as a matter of practice was vested not in the board of arbitration but entirely in the impartial outsider who was called in to listen to the evidence in the particular case under considerationCOLUMBIA LAW REVIEW Where the impartial outsiders were spasmodically drafted and where the personnel of such outsiders varied in each case the parties to the dispute as well as the industry affected were deprived of the advantages which would naturally accrue if the impartial final arbi trator were the same person over a definite and lengthy period of time Such continuous service spelled familiarity with an industry rather than with a particular grievance Machinery has now been improved so as to provide continuity of the industrial policy as trans lated in the decisions rendered The defect in the earlier industrial machinery has been corrected in a dozen or more industries which are now operating under what has been termed the impartial chair man type of agreement Under the impartial chairman type of agreement what might be termed an industrial judge is employed through the funds jointly contributed by the union and the employers association in the industry concerned His term of employment is indefinite and conse quently he stands somewhat in the position of a Prime Minister in that he must necessarily resign as soon as he loses the confidence of either side This of course does not mean that each decision ren dered by the impartial chairman must meet with the approval of all the members of each side for of course that is a practical impossi bility It merely means that these judges are subject to recall and the recall of these industrial judges at least in this period of development rests upon a different basis from the public recall of public judges We have never denied the legitimacy of granting the legislature or the executive the power of judicial recall upon charges We have at this time wisely been slow to approve recall at the will of the electorate The unwillingness to sanction popular recall like the movement for a short ballot reflects our distrust of the power of the electorate intelligently to select or remove more than a few out standing persons in the political panorama With the industrial judges however the criticism of the parties to the agreement more closely resembles charges and the distinction is clear that here the recall is to be exercised not by a partly disinterested populace but by highly interested groups whose attention has been continuously directed toward the issues involved and the capacities of the judges The impartial chairmen now sitting in various industries through out the country often establish their own rules of procedure and as a rule have the power of passing upon all industrial questions arising in the industry under the particular contract in existence between the union and the employers association The practices under which the impartial chairmen operate vary greatly In some markets the contract is merely a charter of fundamental principles to guide the industry establishing the impartial machinery providing for the duration of the agreement and prohibiting strikes and lockouts dur 158DEVELOPMENT OF INDUSTRIAL JURISPRUDENCE 159 ing its pendency In other contracts full details are agreed upon hours of labor rates of piece work methods of election to the trade council method of presentation of appeals rules governing the terms of employment such as union preference hours sanitary con ditions and the like While the general agreement has the merit of flexibility it has the disadvantage of postponing settlement on funda mental issues In at least one labor market the very lack of agree ment on the terms of employment has been responsible to a large extent for the abolition of the impartial chairman Under these various agreements there have been no less than two thousand written decisions rendered by impartial chairmen in this country These decisions cover questions involving the discrimina tion of employer against employee because of union activity right of promotion wrongful discharge increase in wages decrease in wages holidays to be allowed to workers hours of labor method and order of laying off workers during periods of unemployment methods of preference in the rehiring of unemployed basis of pay whether piece work weekwork piecework with minimum guarantee profitsharing or bonus system and even such technical problems as the much mooted question in the textile industry of the desirability of one operators working on two looms or more The range of matters placed before the impartial chairman is as wide as the industry itself Unless provided to the contrary in the contract all incidents of em ployment come within the power of the impartial chairman for con sideration and decision The methods of enforcement of these decisions vary greatly de pending upon the terms of the particular contracts Money fines limited and unlimited may be assessed in certain industries In other cases the decisions rest for their enforcement on the good faith of the parties to the agreement In passing it might be interesting to men tion that under many of the impartial chairmen agreements a legisla tive chamber is established This chamber known either as a trade board or council is composed of an equal number of representatives of labor and employers and through such legislative board a con siderable part of the strain which would be felt by the impartial chair man sitting as a judge is removed by previous agreement in such board or council on mooted industrial problems which involve ques tions of trade policy and which if left unsettled would ordinarily result in cases of individual grievances on the part of individual workers or employers The decisions rendered by impartial chairmen are increasing in number and are in effect a new industrial common law These deci sions are peculiarly impressive considered in relation to statutes en acted by the legislatures such as the Walton Act passed in 1920 by the State of New York for the purposes of enforcing arbitrationCOLUMBIA LAW REVIEW agreements generally At present there is a sufficient camaraderie between the dozen or more impartial chairmen holding office so that there is a sporadic and undirected exchange of decisions Naturally each impartial chairman renders decisions based on the contract under which he holds office Nevertheless the decisions rendered in various labor markets under such agreements carry weight as prece dents in the determination of any case in a separate market Now is the time to collate codify and headnote and properly index the deci sions rendered by impartial chairmen If this general movement of impartial chairmen is to attain the industrial prominence which the writer of this article anticipates and the decisions now being ren dered are not codified and indexed at this time much of the red tape and confusion and many of the conflicts apparent in our regular ad ministration of justice through the courts of the land will creep in to this extrajudicial structure created for the judicial settlement of industrial disputes It may be that in time public official cognizance will have to be taken of such industrial agreements of the courts created thereby and of the decisions rendered thereunder Possibly the appointment pay and control of these industrial judges will be turned over to or assumed by the Government through its departments of labor This may be necessary if for no other reason than to pro tect the consuming public against decisions effecting increases in wages which uneconomically multiplied are translated into the prices paid by consumers for the commodity affected Whether or not the State as such is injected into these new industrial tribunals the codifi cation of such decisions rendered will necessarily tend to uniformity of practice and to the earlier establishment of proper standards of industrial practice Throughout the world irrespective of the individual desires of anyone a general movement is on way which in some form or another is wiping out certain property rights Workmens Compensation Acts inheritance taxes excess profit taxes up to eighty per cent rent legislation tenement house regulatory acts and other evidences of this antiprivate property movement are appearing at a most remarkable pace The corollary of this movement is of course to bring into prominence the counterpart of private property rights namely the industrial rights of those active in industry As this movement grows the courts established by legislation will be addressed increasingly often for the determination of questions affecting industrial rights That our regular legally established judicial system is improperly con ceived and inadequately constructed to handle industrial disputes can scarcely be denied As we stand at the beginning of a new develop ment which promises so much one lesson in particular may be taken from the burdens which an unthinking unscientific original growth of the common law has placed upon society at this time At the very 160DEVELOPMENT OF INDUSTRIAL JURISPRUDENCE 161 inception of the movement the decisions of these selferected indus trial courts should be codified indexed and mechanically properly arranged The resultant uniformity and clarity will aid in the intelli gent development which will bring to fulfillment the promise of in dustrial peace that the impartial chairmen hold out

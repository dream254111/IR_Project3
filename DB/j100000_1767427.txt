only about an hours ride from New York and is in itself a delightful place to spend the summer It offers opportunities for bathing boating and fishing and a visi tor is never at a loss for some pleasant employment The New York Fish Commission has one of its hatching stations here and much of interest and profit accrues to the members of the Labora tory from the study of the specimens in the hatchery Informa tion as to methods of fishhatching and fishculture is to be had simply for the asking for the staff at the hatchery are on the best of terms with the members of the biological school and are willing to accommodate them in every way In short the school at Cold Spring Harbor proposes to offer to all interested in biology a method for spending the summer vaca tion pleasantly and at the same time profitably Many are in clined to think the summer vacation of our colleges too long but it is not so to one who attends such a school for here he gains both recreation and profit The Laboratory offers him a chance for acquainting himself with living nature and the living princi ples of biological science If he is already an advanced student he is offered chances for special work in the line of topics of his own choosing If he is a teacher he can get practical experience with animals and plants and can make collections for his classes and for the college professor the recreation of the holiday is combined with facilities for research along lines of biological investigation Last but not least to all is offered opportunity for personal as sociation with educators and original thinkers in lines of science The school has been successful thus far and its future promises greater growth and wider intluence ON SOME HABITS OF AMPHIUMA MEANS BY CHARLES W HARGITT SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY THROUGH the kindness of Professor H J Clements MD of New Orleans I had sent to me from the Louisiana swamps a half dozen of the socalled  Congo snakes  early last spring Two of them were adults of from twenty to thirty inches in length the others being young ones not exceeding twelve inches from  tip to tip They were shipped in damp gray moss Tillandsia usneides and with a single exception all came through alive and in good condition They were for want of better quarters placed in an aquarium in which were a number of freshwater clams Unio At first they were quite sluggish and seemed not at all disposed to be  at home in their new surroundings This was especially true of the adult Gradually however the young Congos began to show signs of interest and appetite I found an empty clamshell one morning in the aquarium and further observation soon ex plained it No sooner did a clam show signs of declining vitality by an unusual gaping of the shell than it would be seized by one often indeed by two of the amphibians and there was seldom any release till the shell had been relieved of its occupant The struggle which ensued when two of them would seize a single clam was exciting and amusing in the extreme Such tugging writhing and twisting into perplexing coils one seldom sees especially among members of this class They proved to be exceedingly voracious and it was but a short time ere they had disposed of some two dozen clams and had shown a remarkable growth proving the healthfulness of the diet This activity however pertained only to the young The adult became more and more sluggish and it became evident within a fortnight that it would not long endure the conditions It moreover became quite ugly of disposition and would bite sav agely at anything within reach even maiming itself It was consequently consigned to the dissectingtable The clams having been disposed of by the others they were left for a few days without food My attention was one day at tracted to the aquarium by an unusual commotion and to my surprise upon examination I found that one of the more thrifty had turned cannibal and had half swallowed one of his less vigorous NCE I59 fellows He was made to disgorge by a sharp squeeze about the thoracic region and I hoped the thing was at an end But in less than an hour the same thing was repeated even more savagely and upon the same victim I immediately removed both from the tank killing the badly injured one and leaving the other by itself Within another day the same thing had been repeated between the two remaining in the aquarian but was discovered before it had gone so far They were subsequently fed upon fresh meat from other sources birds etc but did not seem to thrive upon it finally refusing to take it They would take earthworms but showed no disposition to take insect food One of the number still lives in the same aquarium and seems fairly at home so long as fed satisfactorily It has gone for some time without food with apparently no discomfort These notes may add something to our knowledge of their probable mode of life That they are carnivorous is quite certain At no time did they show any disposition to touch vegetation though a variety was growing at hand That under certain circumstances they with others of their class will turn cannibal is also quite certain I have known the common bullfrog Rana catesbiana to devour no less than a halfdozen fairsized leopard frogs Rana virescens within as many days The same disposition has been noted among the members of other genera It is less common indeed rare between members of the same species and approximately the same size as was the case under consideration NOTES AND NEWS BULLETIN 41 of the Purdue University Agricultural Experi ment Station contains information of interest and importance con cerning wheat as grown in Indiana The following are some of the points of importance as given in the Bulletin 1 Velvet chaff Michigan amber and Fultz varieties of wheat have been grown for nine years on the university farm and rank in value as named though Michigan amber surpasses Velvet chaff as a rustresisting variety 2 Red Clawson and Joness winter fife are the two most promising recently introduced varieties 3 For eight years six pecks of seed sown per acre have given the most satisfactory re sults 4 In the region of Lafayette a higher average yield has been secured from wheat sown Sept 20 over other dates of sow ing 5 Judicious rotations including grass have given better return than constant graincropping 6 Heavy applications of manure and fertilizers to a worn soil growing corn and wheat alternately have given paying returns 7 The average results of all the experiments at this station with fertilizers and manures upon wheat during the past three years in full or twothirds doses have not been profitable 8 The use of hot water or copper sul phate failed to destroy the spores of loose smut 9 Bunt or stinkingsmut in wheat was successfully destroyed by using hot water or copper sulphate 10 Early and late harvesting of wheat had practically no effect on yield or weight of grain 11 Yield of grain and straw were considerably reduced by mowing wheat on certain plats in spring to check rankness of growth 12 In comparing forms of nitrogen for fertilizing the wheat plant sul phate of ammonia gave rather better yield than nitrate of soda or dried blood 13 As the plants fertilized with nitrate were slower to mature than the others these also sufferedmore from rust than did the others Persons interested in a more complete account of these wheat experiments or who wish the publications of the station can secure free copies of the same by addressing C S Plumb director of Experiment Station Lafayette Ind  The Illustrated American which has achieved great popu larity as the handsomest illustrated weekly published in our coun try has been reduced in price from twentyfive to ten cents This reduction has been brought about by improvements in its engrav ing and printing establishment and it is claimed will in no way affect its literary and artistic excellence This change places within the reach of all a most excellent periodical  Harvard University is about to publish a reprint of certain important 1 State Papers and Speeches on the Tariff by Hamil ton Gallatin Webster and other

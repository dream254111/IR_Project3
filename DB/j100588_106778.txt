THE COAST OF COLOX MANDEL I HAVE ALREADY EXTELLDED TLLEM TO ABOUT GOO LNILES FROTN MADRAS ARLD AM UPON RETURNING BACK TO PROSECUTE TLLE WORK QTLITE DOWN TO CAPE COMORILA LHE ANGLES ARE ALL TAKELL WITH MY HADLEYS SEXTANT MADE BY STANCLIFFE BY MEALLS OF THREE TA11 SIGNAS I 1LAVE CONSTRTLCTED OF BALUBOOS 80 FEET LAIGLL 60 OF SVLLICLL I MOUNT UPON STEPS SO AS TO SEE OVER ALL TREES C  VERY DISTINCTLY MY TWO OTHER SIGNALS AT THE DISTALLCE OF FROM 8 TO 13 LUILES IT IS I BELIEVE TLLE FILST TIME TLLE HADLEY WAS EVER MADE USE OF FOR A PURPOSE OF SUCH MAGNITUDE BUT IT IS FULLY EQUAL TO ITNAY IT DOES MORE  THE SU11S BEARING OR OB LIQUE DISTANCE FROM MY SIGNALS IS ALSO TAKELL BY IT BY WHICH AND HIS AZIMUTLL COMPUTED I OBTAIN THE ALLGLES LUADE BY THEM NVITH THE MERIDIALL  AND BY COZNBINILLG THE WHOLE THE DIFFERENCE OF LATITUDE ALLD MERIDIONAL DISTANCE OF EVERY OTLE OF TLLENZ ILL ENGLISH FATLLOMS THIS IS FOTLLLD SO LLICELY THAT A MEAN OF MY ASTRONOLLLICAL OBSERVATIOLLS FOR THE LATITUDES 1LEVER DIFFERS MORE THAN A FEW SECOLLDS FROM THOSE GIVEN BY THE GEOMETRICAL MEN SURATION ILL ALL THE OPERATIONS I HAVE HAD NO OLAE TO ASSIST ME9 O 2 100 MR TOPPINGS SCCOANF OF THE MEASUREMZET EXCEPT A PARTY OF BLACK FELLOWS TO CARRY MY FLAGS I NEED NOF TELL YOU HOW MANY THOUSAND INILES I HAVE TRAVELLED TO TALFE THE ANGLES ILOR VLLAT THE LABOUR AND FATIGUE OF SUCH A WORK MUST BE IN THIS BURNIRLG CLIMATE WHERE I HAVE FREQUENTLY HAD THE THERMOMETER AT OO60 IN MY TENT SIGRLED MTROPPING SA XCCOUNT OF TBE SIEASUREMENT QF A BASE LILLE UPON TBE SEA BEACH NEAR PORTO NONTON ON TBE COAST OF COROMANDEL IG MAYN 1Y88Y BY MR MICHAEL TOPPIILG AS ANECESSARY FBUNCITION FOR TLLE CHAIN OF TRIANGLES NOSR CARRYING ON I LLAVE FOR SOME TIME PAST HAD INY THOUGHTS BENT TOWARDS MEASURING WITH A11 POSSIBLE ACCURACY A BASE LINEO LTHISBASE LINE COULD I HAVECHOWSEN ITS SITUATIONHOULD HAVEBEEN DETERMINECT AS NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THE LINE OF COAST I AM SURVEY ING AS POSSIBLE BUT CIRCUMSTANCES LLAVE LLOT PERMITTED ME TO XNAKE UNRESTRAINED CHOICEOF ITS PLACE 0L1 TOY ARRIVAL AT CUD DALORE I WAS TOLD THAT AS I PROCEECLED SOUTHSRARD I SHOULCL MEET WITH FIREQUENT RIVERS AND OTELER WATER COURSES THAT WOULD CERTAINLY OBSTRUCT ME IN THE DESIGTL I HAD FORMED OF MEASURING IT ON THE SEA BEACH FARTHER SOUTLA  AND SOON AFTER MY REMOVAL FROM THAT PLACE IFOUND WITLA MUCH SATISFACTIOLL THAT THE COAST BETWEEN CUDCLALORE RLVER AND PORTO NOVO WOTLLD SERVE RNY PURPOSE EXTREMELY VERELL THE IACH HEREABOUTS IS FLAT BROAD AND REMARKABLY SMOOTH TLLE ONLY SPECIOVIS OBJECTION THAT CAN BE MADE TO IT IS ITS NOT BEING STRAIGHT BUT FORMING A CUR6REDLINE CONCAVE TOVARDS THE SEA THIS HOWEVER I KNCUR TO BE IU REALITY OFS NO BAD CONSEQUENCE SINCE SEVERAL RIGHTOF A BASE LINE ON THE COAST OF COROMANDEI O1 LITLES OF SUFFICIENT LENGTH MIGHT I PERCEIVED BE LALEASURED UPOLL IT THE ANGLES THEY MIGHT INTERCHANGEABLY MALIE BE TAKEN  AND TLLE WHOLE AFTERVSLARDS BE REDUCED TO ONE DWIRECT LINE BY CALCULATION THESE CONSIDERATIONS AND AN ACCIDENT TLAAT ABOUT THE SAME TIME BEFEL ONE OF MY SIGNALS AND DELAYED MY TRIGONOMETRICAL PROGRESS FINALLY DETERMINED NE TO MEASURE MY BASE AT THIS OPPORTUNITY AND I ACCORDINGLY BEGALL THAT WORK BY PLACING TWO OF MY LARGE SIGNALS AT THE DISTANCE AS NEARLY AS I  COULD JUDGE OF SEVEN MILES ASULLDER FOR THE TERLUS OR EXTREMITIES OF IT IN TRAVERSING THE COUST BETWEEN THELSIGNALS I FOUND THAT IN ORDER TO CONTINUE REY OPERATIONS THROUGHOUT UPON THE TNOST AD VANTAGEOTLS PART OF THE BEACH I LMUST DIVIDE THE WLLOLE DISTANCE INTO SIX DISTINCT PORTIOTLS EACH PORTIORL FORMING A LARGE ANGL WITH THE NEXT PORTION TO IT ALLD THIS I IMMEDIATELY DID BY PLACINGFIVE LESSER FLAGS AT ILLTERVALS CONVENINT FOR THAT PURR POSE I NOW BEGAN MY MEASUREMENT IN PROSECUTING WHICEL I SPARED NEITHER PAINS RLOR CARE TLLE TWO RODS OF 25 FEET EACLLY HICH I HAD PROVIDED FOR THIS USE HAD TEEN STRICTLY EXALUIRLED WHILE I WAS AT CUDDALORE AND THEIR LERLGTHS ASCERTAIRLED AS EXACTLY AS THE CONVENIENCES THIS COUALTRY AFFORDS WTOTLLD ADMIT OFS THEY HAD BEEN LEFT PURPOSELY A LITTILE TCRO LORLX AS I FOUZD IT EASIER TO DETERTNINE ALLD ALLOW BR SUCH EXCESS THAN TO REDUCE THEN TO SUFFICIENT EXACTNESS IN SETTLING THEIR RESPECTIVE LENGTHS A CAPITAL TWOFEET BRASS SECTOR BY ADAMS WAS RNADE USE OF AS A STANDARD THIS INSTRUMENT SVAS LLOT ONLY THE BEST AUTHORITY I COULD PROCURE BUT BEING MY OWM PROPERTY WOULD I CONSIDERED BE READY FOR AN EXAMITLATIOILN SHOULD AL OPPORTUSMR TOPPING9S ACCOUNT OF TBE MEASUREMENT 1OB NITY ARISE OF COMPARING IT IN FUTURE WITH ANY LNEASURE OF MORE ACKNVWLEDGED CREDITZ THE THERMOMETER STOOD AT X70 WHEN THE RODS WERE ADJUSTED BY IT 7MBE STANDS WHICH I HAD PREPARED FOR LEVELLING THE RODSS WERE ALSO BROLLGHT OUT AND IT WAS WITH MUCH REGRET THAT I FIOUND I COULD NOT PROFIT BY THEM AS I HAD HOPED TO DO ASSISTED AS I WAS BY NONE BUT BLACK PEOPLE IN WHOTN I PERCEIVED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE SVITHOUT INCURRING GREAT LOSS OF TIME TO HAVE ILUPRESSED A NECESSARY IDEA OF TLLEIR NATURE ANCL MANAGETMENT I THEREFORE RESOLVED TO DISPENSE WITLL THE STANDS AND TO 1AY TLLE RODS ERLD TO END UPON THE GROUND 1T WAS IN A SIMILAR WAY THAT THE BASE LINE FOR A SERIES OF TRIANGLES CON TINUED THROUGHOUT FRANCE WAS MEASURED THE FRENCH RODSS WHICH E7ERE NEARLY OF THE SAME LENGTH AND CONSTRUCTION WITH MINE SVERE DISPOSEDJ IN THE VERY SALALE RNANNER UPON THE RUG GED PAVEMENT OF A HIGHWAY NEAR PARIS SO THAT I HAVE EVERY REASOTL TO BELIEVE TLLE OPPORTULLITY HERE AFFORDED ME OF A PECU LIARLY LEVEL AND SARLDY BEACLA TO BE THE BEST OF THE TWO THE MODE OF CONDUCTING THE MEASLLREMENT WAS THISSTAVES WERE FIRST SET UP IN A DIRECT LINE BETWEEN THE FLAGS  FROM EVERY TWO OF THESE STAVES A ROPE WAS OCCASIONALLY STRETCHED AS TIGHT AS POSSIBLE ON THE GROUNDV AND THE RODS WERE LAID BY THE SIDE OF THE ROPEW THE FIRST ROD BEING PROPERLY PLACED THE SECOND WAS LAID NEDR ITS END AND THEN VERY CAREFIULLY ADJUSTED SO AS TO TOUCH THE FERRULE OF THE OTHER BY A LNAN THO HAL NO OTHER EMPLOYMENT TO ENGAGE HIS ATTELLTION AND IN THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS OFECE HE WAS CLOSELY WATCHED BY MYSELF THE FERRULESJ WHICH WERE OF THICK BRASS HAD BEEN ROLLNDED NOT ONLY TO TNAKE TLLE CONTACT MORE VISIBLE BUT BECAUSE THE LENGTH OF EACH ROD SVAS DETERMINED BY THEIR HAVING THE SPHERICAL FIGURE LLLOREOF A BASE LINE ON THE COAST OF COROMANDEL 103 EASILYG AT THE PLACING OF EVERY SECOND ROD WHICH WAS PAINTEL

AFTER WARDS REMEASURED AND GAVE CORRECTLY THE SAME NUMBER OF ROUS AT THE CONCLUSION OF EACH SEVERAL MEASUREMENT THAT I MIGHT KRLOW EXACTLY WHERE TO RESUME IT A STAKE THREE OR FOUR FEET LONG WAS DRIVEN INTO THE GROUND TILL ITS HEAD LVECAME EVEN WITH THE SURFACE 0N THE TOP OF THIS STAKE THE BUT OF THE LAST ROD WAS LAID AND A LINE DRAWN ACROSS IT UTITH A POINTED IRLSTRUMENT SHEWED PRECISELY WHERE TO

DECISIONS and violence toward persons employed by plaintiff Held 1 While the first part of  20 of the Clayton Act forbids an injunction to prevent peaceful persuasion by employees discharged or expectant in promotion of their side of the dispute it is merely declaratory of the common law and all attempts at persuasion or communication which lead to intimida tion and obstruction are not included within this section of the Clayton Act and will be restrained 2 In order to prevent intimidation and violence defendants shall be entitled only to one representative for each point of ingress and egress in the plant for the purpose or observation communication or persuasion provided they be not abusive libelous or threatening and such representatives shall approach individuals singly and not together and shall not in their single efforts at communication or persuasion obstruct an unwilling listener by importunate following or dogging his steps American Steel Foundaries v TriCity Central Trades Council 42 Sup Ct Rep 72 1921 The effect of the decision in this case though the court carefully avoided using the words is that it upholds the right of Peaceful Picket ing in certain cases that is persuasion and communication may be used by the strikers so long as such persuasion and communication do not amount to violence intimidation and obstruction of the employers business But it must be clearly understood as was pointed out by the court that this decision applies only to the facts in the instant case and cannot be laid down as a rigid rule For a general discussion of the different views taken by the courts on this subject see 7 VA LAW REV 462 INTOXICATING LIQUORSWARRANTS OF SEARCH AND SEIZURELIQUORS CANNOT BE SEIZED WITHOUT WARRANT AND WHEN UNLAWFULLY SEIZED MUST BE RETURNED TO OWNERA person was seen by prohibition agents leaving the house of the petitioner Upon searching and questioning him they were informed that the petitioner had sold him some liquor Without obtaining a warrant for the search of a private dwelling as re quired by the National Prohibition Act the agents entered the petition ers house and seized the liquors found therein There was nothing to indicate when the liquors were acquired In a criminal prosecution a petition was made for the return of the liquors Held petition granted Connelly v United States 275 Fed 509 1921 The Fourth Amendment to the Federal Constitution was not the first move to crystallize those principles which secure individual rights against unreasonable searches and seizures Entick v Carrington 19 Howells State Trials 1029 1765 Bill of Rights of Virginia  10 See also Boyd v United States 116 U S 616 1886 And it is to be ob served that no power exists at common law to make a search and seizure without a warrant People v Halveksz Mich 183 N W 752 1921 In re Swan 150 U S 637 14 Sup Ct 225 37 L Ed 1207 1893 Except for the character of the documents seized the law in cases of unlawful searches is now well settled Weeks v United States 232 U S 383 L R A 1915B 834 Ann Cas 1915C 1177 1914 Silverthorne Lumber Co v United States 251 U S 385 1920 299VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW It is to be noticed that if the seized property although seized under an invalid warrant could not possibly be lawfully in the possession of the accused such as an illicit still or implements of crime a return of such property will not be ordered United States v Rykowski 267 Fed 866 1920 Haywood v United States 268 Fed 795 1920 Section 2 title 2 of the Volstead Act 41 Stat 305 provides that section 1014 Rev St U S Comp St 1674 is made applicable to the enforcement of that Act and that the officers mentioned in section 1014 are authorized to issue search warrants under the limitations pro vided in title 11 of the Act of June 15th 1917 40 Stat 217 et seq A State statute making it mandatory upon a magistrate to issue a search warrant when a sworn complaint or affidavit charging the unlawful sale of liquors is presented to him is unconstitutional because it ex cludes the element of discretion in determining probable cause People v Delamater Mich 182 N W 57 1921 For the same reason a war rant issued upon a conclusion of the applicant without any facts being stated in the application upon which the judicial officer to whom it is addressed may form his own conclusion as to probable cause is in valid State v District Court Mont 198 Pac 362 1921 United States v Rykowski supra But see contra Rose v State 171 Ind 662 87 N E 103 17 Ann Cas 228 1909 Lowrey v Gridley 30 Conn 450 1862 So also a warrant for the search of an apartment building without any evidence being presented to the commissioner that the premises are be ing used for the unlawful sale of liquor is invalid United States v Mitchell 274 Fed 128 1921 Acts recited in a search warrant charging one with having in possession liquor in violation of both State law and city ordinance will support a search and seizure although under the National Prohibition Act section 25 such acts would be inadequate since io search warrant shall issue to search a private dwelling unless used for the unlawful sale of liquor United States v Viess 273 Fed 279 1921 United States v Armstrong 275 Fed 506 1921 In accordance with the strict rules for issuing search warrants it is held that a search warrant cannot be amended by a telephone communi cation from the commissioner who issued it United States v Mitchell supra Nor can an unlawful entry into a dwelling be legalized by a war rant issued upon information thereby secured United States v Mitchell supra Likewise a search warrant or subpoena issued on information obtained at the time of a previous illegal search does not authorize the retention of documents seized at that time United States v Kraus 270 Fed 578 1921 Silverthorne Lumber Co v United States supra That is an unlawful search cannot be justified by what is found United States v Slusser 270 Fed 818 1921 The scope of the authority of the executing officer is to be defined by the terms of the warrant For instance it has been held that trespass quare clausum fregit may be maintained against an officer who with a warrant to search a dwelling searched the barn on the premises and seized the liquor stored therein Jones v Fletcher 41 Me 254 1856 As to the recovery of damages for the unlawful execution of a warrant see 6 VA LAW Rv 599 And a warrant to search certain premises 300RECENT DECISIONS does not authorize the officer to search a person not described in the affidavit who is casually on the premises Purkey v Mabey Idaho 193 Pac 79 1920 The constitutional right to be protected against an unlawful search and seizure extends even to a corporation Silverthorne Lumber Co v United States supra It covers also the garage on the premises of the accused United States v Slusser supra A private dwell ing does not lose its character as such and become a distillery because upon a search a still is found in operation upon the premises United States v Kelii 272 Fed 484 1921 Since the making of the return of the warrant is merely a ministerial act the failure of the officer to whom a search warrant is directed to make a return thereof cannot invalidate the search or seizure made under the warrant Rose v United States 274 Fed 245 1921 Nor under the Volstead Act does it invalidate the warrant United States v Kraus supra As to seizure without a warrant the National Prohibition Act provides that an officer is not justified in seizing intoxicating liquor or other prop erty without a search warrant except as provided in section 26 of that Act which requires him to seize all intoxicating liquors being trans ported contrary to law United States v Crossen 264 Fed 459 i920 On the grounds that an officer may avert a criminal act in the process of commission before him it is held that an officer whose sense of smell informs him that the law is being violated may without a warrant enter a nearby house and arrest the persons found there conducting an illicit still and seize the apparatus so used United States v Borkowski 268 Fed 408 1920 The correctness of this holding is to be doubted and its dangerous tendency deprecated It is interesting to note in this connection that the socalled Stanley amendment to the National Prohibition Act approved by the President on Nov 23 1921 provides that any federal prohibition agent who shall search any private dwelling without a search warrant or who shall without a search warrant maliciously and without reasonable cause search any other building or property shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and liable to a fine And any person who shall impersonate a federal agent and shall arrest or detain any person or in any manner search the person building or other property of any person shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and liable to a fine or imprisonment or both INSURANCEOPTION TO ANOTHER TO PURCHASE REAL PROPERTY DoEs NOT PASS TITLE TO SUCH PROPERTY So AS TO AVOID INSURANCE POLICY THEREON Plaintiff who was the owner of a certain residence insured it with defendant company Later plaintiff made an executory contract for the sale of the property to a third person Plaintiff claimed this contract was only an option and the trial judge sitting as chancellor reformed and found the alleged contract to be an option only The third person never exercised this option but cancelled and returned the written contract to the plaintiff Later the insured residence burned and plain tiff sought to collect the insurance Defendant refused payment on the ground that plaintiff had divested himself of all insurable interest in the property and was not entitled to collect the insurance under the 301

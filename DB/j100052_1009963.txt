J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1009963,HARMONIZING LABOR AND CAPITAL BY MEANS OF INDUSTRIAL PARTNERSHIP,I242549,HARMONIZING LABOR AND CAPITAL BY MEANS OF INDUSTRIAL PARTNERSHIP BY ALEXANDER PURVES TREASURER HAMPTON INSTITUTE VIRGINIA IN THIS AGE OF BUSINESS SUPREMACY WHEN TRADE HAS BECOME THE LEADING SCIENCE AND MERCHANDISING AN ART WHEN SENTIMENT IS BEING PUSHED ASIDE BY THE FORWARD RUSH OF COMMERCIALISM AND EXPEDI ENCY SEEMS TO BE SUCCESSFULLY COMPETING WITH MORALITY WHEN ONE IS ALMOST PERSUADED THAT THE CHURCH ITSELF TO SURVIVE MUST BE CON DUCTED WITH BUSINESS SAGACITY ONE IS COMPELLED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE FUTILITY OF URGING ANY PLAN FOR THE REFORMATION OF THE EXISTING RELATIONS BETWEEN CAPITAL AND LABOR WITH SERIOUS HOPES FOR ITS PRESENT CONSIDERATION AND POSSIBLE ADOPTION EXCEPT THE SAME SHALL BE ABLE TO PROVE ITS PRINCIPLES TO BE IN ACCORD WITH GOOD BUSINESS POLICY THERE ARE THOSE WHO BELIEVE THE DANGER TO VESTED INTERESTS IS INCREASING PROPORTIONATELY WITH THE EVER GROWING AVERAGE OF INTELLI GENCE ON THE PART OF THE WAGEEARNERS AND THAT THE FORMER WILL EVENTUALLY BE OVERWHELMED BY THE LATTER TO THE DEMORALIZATION OF BOTH UNLESS CAPITAL ANTICIPATES AND AVERTS THE DANGER BY SECURING AND MAINTAINING A HEARTY COOPERATION OF THE WORKING CLASSES THROUGH A SUBSTANTIAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE JUST CLAIMS OF ENLIGHT ENED LABOR TO AN ENLARGED SHARE IN THE PRODUCT OF THE TWO IT SEEMS REASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT WITH THE ADVANCE OF CIVILI ZATION AND GENERAL INTELLIGENCE SOME MEANS MUST BE FOUND FOR THE TREATMENT OF THE WHOLE MATTER OF THE RETURN FOR SERVICES RENDERED THAT SHALL BE MORE PROGRESSIVE AND MORE HUMANE IN CHARACTER THAN THE PRESENT BASIS OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND AS PROF GILMAN SAYSWE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE WAGES SYSTEM VIEWED IN ITS SIMPLEST FORM OF TIME WAGES DOES NOT SUPPLY THE NECESSARY MOTIVES FOR THE WORKMAN TO DO HIS BEST TO WHICH WE MAY ADD THAT NEITHER DOES IT APPEAL TO HIS SENSE OF RIGHT NOR TO HIS THEORY OF JUSTICE THE FIRST ADVANCE TOWARDS A CHANGE MUST BE MADE BY THE MASTERS AND ANY MOVEMENT FOR A REVISION OF THE EXISTING SYSTEM MUST TAKE FORM IN AN APPARENT CONCESSION ON THE PART OF VESTED 6ITHE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY INTERESTS THE APPARENT INDIFFERENCE AND COMPLACENCY WITH WHICH THE DOMINANT CLASS REGARDS THE WHOLE MATTER IS MOST REGRETTABLE THE LEADERS IN REFORM SHOULD ADOPT SOME PLAN WHOSE SUCCESSFUL OPERATION WOULD COMMEND ITSELFFROM A BUSINESS POINT OF VIEW TO THE MANY MASTERS THAT IS TO SAY WHATEVER IS DONE IN THAT DIRECTION LET IT BE DONE PRIMARILY BECAUSE IT IS JUST AND RIGHT THEN IF IT CAN BE SHOWN TO BE PROFITABLE TO CAPITAL SO MUCH THE BETTER SUCH A DEMONSTRATION WOULD BE INVALUABLE NOT SO MUCH BY REASON OF THE RESULTING INCREASE IN THE INCOMES OF THE LEADERS IN THE MOVEMENT AS THAT SUCH A FACT WOULD MAKE PROBABLE THE EXTENSION OF THE SYSTEM INTO OTHER ENTERPRISES WHERE SUCH AN INCENTIVE WOULD HAVE THE STRONGER INFLUENCE THE SUCCESSES MODERATE THOUGH THEY HAVE BEEN WHICH HAVE GENERALLY ATTENDED THE INTRODUCTION AND OPERATION OF PROFITSHARING PLANS IN VARIOUS FORMS SHOULD ENCOURAGE FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS AND EXTENSIONS OF THAT SYSTEM IN THE BROADEST MANNER POSSIBLE WITHOUT HOWEVER INTRODUCING OR PERMITTING ANY FEATURES THAT WOULD EMBARRASS THE ADMINISTRATION OR WEAKEN THE PERSONNEL AS THE SUCCESSFUL MANUFACTURERS OF THE PRESENT GENERATION ARE LARGELY THOSE WHO HAVE FOUND WAYS TO UTILIZE THE BYPRODUCTS AND THE POWER WHICH HAD THERETOFORE GONE TO WASTE SO THE SUCCESSFUL MASTERS OF THE FUTURE MUST BE THOSE WHO SHALL FIND SOME MEANS OF HARMONIZING THE DEMANDS OF CAPITAL AND LABOR THUS SAVING AND UTILIZING THAT LARGE PERCENTAGE OF HUMAN ENERGY WHICH IS NOW WORSE THAN WASTED IN THE CONTINUAL CONTENTION PASSIVE OR ACTIVE BETWEEN THE WORKING CLASSES AND VESTED INTERESTS APART FROM EVERY OTHER ELEMENT OF ADVANTAGE CAN THERE BE ANY QUESTION AS TO THE INCREASED PHYSICAL CAPACITY AND STAYING POWERS OF A MAN WHEN LED ON IN HOPEFUL EXPECTANCY RATHER THAN WHEN DRIVEN ON BY PHYSICAL NECESSITY IT IS JUSTLY CLAIMED THAT IN MANY INSTANCES THE WAGEEARNERS WOULD NOT BE BENEFITED BY A DISTRIBUTION IN CASH OF A PERCENTAGE OF THE PROFITS THAT THEY WOULD FRITTER IT AWAY EITHER FOOLISHLY OR WITH LACK OF DISCRETION THERE IS NOTHING TO WHICH THE AVERAGE FAMILY CAN ADJUST ITSELF SO EASILY AND WITH SUCH ALACRITY AS TO AN INCREASE IN INCOME COULD WE BUT SAVE THE WASTES OF CARELESSNESS THE LOSSES FROM STRIKES AND LOCKOUTS AND TO THESE ADD THE ENLARGED PROFITS RESULTING FROM A BROADER COOPERATION AND GREATER PHYSICAL ABILITY TO PRODUCE THEN CAPITALIZE AND CONSERVE ALL OF THESE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THOSE WHO IN EACH CASE HAVE CONTRIBUTED THEIR PROPORTION 62HARMONIZING LABOR AND CAPITAL EITHER IN CAPITAL BRAINS OR LABORTO THE ENLARGED SUCCESS OF THE ENTERPRISE WE WOULD HAVE PLACED WITHIN REACH BETTER HOMES BETTER CLOTHING BETTER FOOD BETTER SCHOOLS AND HAVE TAKEN A STEP FORWARD WHICH SHOULD INSPIRE INDIVIDUALS OF BOTH CLASSES WITH HIGHER AMBI TIONS FOR A LARGER AND BETTER LIFE PROSPERITY SHARING STRICTLY SPEAKING DOES NOT GO FAR ENOUGH BECAUSE IT LIMITS THE AMOUNT AWARDED TO LABOR TO A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE REAL PROFITS THE SHARE MUST BE SMALL BECAUSE ADVERSITY SHARING DOES NOT ACCOMPANY PROFITSHARING IN ALL FAIRNESS THE SHARE OF LABOR IN THE MARGINS OF THE BUSINESS SHOULD BE OF SUCH PROPORTIONS THAT JUSTICE TO ALL WOULD MAKE IT ALIKE A SHARER IN LOSSES AS WELL AS IN GAINS BY THIS WE DO NOT MEAN TO SAY WHEN LOSSES OCCUR THAT LABOR SHOULD CONTRIBUTE ACTUAL MONEY TO MAKE GOOD ANY PORTION OF THE IMPAIRMENT SUCH A PROPOSITION WOULD BE IMPRACTICABLE AND IMPOSSIBLE THE SHARE OF LABOR IN THE SUR PLUS PROFITSTHAT IS AFTER THE PAYMENT OF STANDARD WAGES AND A JUST RETURN TO CAPITAL FOR ITS SIMPLE USESHOULD BE UPON A MOST LIBERAL BASIS AND ANY AND ALL IMPAIRMENTS SUFFERED IN YEARS OF ADVERSITY SHOULD BE MADE GOOD OUT OF SUBSEQUENT SURPLUS EARNINGS IN WHICH EXCEPT FOR SUCH IMPAIRMENT LABOR WOULD HAVE BEEN A SHARER BEFORE WAGES SHALL AGAIN BE ENTITLED TO ANY FURTHER DIVIDENDS AMONGST THE VARIOUS SCHEMES THAT HAVE BEEN PUT INTO OPERA TION IN THOSE CONCERNS WHICH HAVE ENDEAVORED TO MAKE THEIR EMPLOYEES SHARERS IN THE PROFITS OF THE BUSINESS THE MOST FAMILIAR PLAN IS THAT OF OFFERING TO WAGES A DIVIDEND ON THE TOTAL AMOUNT THEREOF AT THE SAME RATE OF PERCENTAGE AS IS PAID ON THE PAR VALUE OF THE CAPITAL STOCK THIS PROPOSITION IS UNFAIR SINCE IN MOST INDUSTRIES THE CAPITAL STOCK AMOUNTS TO SEVERAL TIMES THE TOTAL OF THE ANNUAL PAYROLL AFTER THE FIRST ADJUSTMENT UPON THAT BASIS THE INCENTIVE TO LABOR TO STRIVE FOR LARGER RESULTS IS ALMOST INSIG NIFICANT SINCE THE SHARE OF WAGES IN THE SUBSEQUENT INCREASED EARNINGS WOULD WHERE THE CAPITAL IS EQUAL TO SAY FOUR TIMES THE ANNUAL PAYROLL AMOUNT TO ONLY ONEFIFTH OF THE INCREASE IN NET EARNINGS THE OTHER FOURFIFTHS THEREOF GOING TO CAPITAL OTHER INSTITUTIONS HAVE ESTABLISHED A CUSTOM OF PRESENTING TO THEIR EMPLOYEES ANNUALLY A SUM OF MONEY EQUAL TO A CERTAIN PER CENTAGE OF THEIR SALARIES BUT THIS EXTRA INCOME SOON BECOMES AS MUCH A MATTER OF WAGES AS THE WEEKLY OR MONTHLY PAYROLL AND LITTLE REAL GOOD IS ACCOMPLISHEDTHE EMPLOYEE IS STILL WORKING FOR FIXED WAGES THERE IS SOMETHING IN THE MAKEUP OF A MAN THAT CANNOT 63THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY BE WHOLLY SATISFIED NO MATTER HOW SECURE IT MAY BE WITH A DEFINITE AGREEMENT THAT HE SHALL RECEIVE A CERTAIN FIXED SUM OF MONEY FOR A GIVEN AMOUNT OF WORK HOWEVER LIBERAL THE COMPENSATION MAY BE THERE IS A POSITIVE SATISFACTION IN HAVING A PECUNIARY INTEREST IN AN ENTERPRISE WHERE THE FINANCIAL RETURN IS NOT DEFINITELY RESTRICTED AND KNOWN IN ADVANCE EVEN THOUGH THERE MAY BE AS AN ACCOM PANIMENT SOME DANGER OF A LOSS ANY ATTEMPT TO SATISFY THE CRAVING OF LABOR FOR JUSTICE WILL FAIL IF HANDICAPPED BY PATERNALISM A MAN MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED A MAN HIS SENSE OF INDEPENDENCE AND SELFRESPECT MUST BE STRENGTH ENED AND NOT CRUSHED FURTHERMORE A MAN IS NOT SATISFIED TO HAVE EVEN A PART OF HIS JUST EARNINGS EXPENDED FOR HIM COMPANY KINDERGARTENS COMPANY LIBRARIES COMPANY CHURCHES ARE DOUBTLESS VERY ESTIMABLE IN THEIR WAY AND ARE DOING MUCH GOOD THEY ARE A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIREC TION AND MOST VALUABLE IN THE PRACTICAL DEMONSTRATION WHICH THEY OFFER THAT IT PAYS CAPITAL TO IMPROVE THE CONDITIONS AND SURROUND INGS IN WHICH THE OPERATIVES LIVE BUT THOSE WHO ARE TO ENJOY THESE INSTITUTIONS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO FEEL THAT THEY ARE UNDER ANY OBLIGATIONS TO THE OWNERS THEREOF RATHER THEY SHOULD BE GIVEN TO UNDERSTAND THAT A CERTAIN DEFINITE PERCENTAGE OF THE NET EARNINGS OF THE ENTERPRISE WOULD BE EXPENDED FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD NOT AS A BENEFACTION BUT AS A JUST DUEGIVING TO THE OPERATIVES AS FAR AS POSSIBLE THE ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT OF SUCH COM PANY INSTITUTIONS SOME MANUFACTURERS BELIEVE THAT IF THEIR EMPLOYEES CAN BE INDUCED TO PURCHASE HOMES ADJACENT TO THE MILLS THE LABOR PROBLEM HAS BEEN SOLVED FROM THE MANUFACTURERS POINT OF VIEW THE PLAN IS ATTRACTIVE AN EMPLOYEE WHO PUTS THE HARDEARNED SAVINGS OF YEARS INTO A SMALL DWELLINGGENERALLY SITUATED IN A COMMUNITY WHOLLY DEPENDENT UPON THE LOCAL MILL OF HIS EMPLOYERDOUBT LESS TIES HIMSELF UP VERY EFFECTUALLY TO THE ENTERPRISE BUT WHETHER HE IS ATTACHED BY HIS LOYALTY TO AND AFFECTION FOR THE CONCERN OR IS HELD BY THE SELFWELDED FETTERS OF A MONEY INVESTMENT IS AN OPEN QUESTION THE ACTUAL VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT IN ANY BUSINESS IS BASED PRIMARILY UPON THE SECURITYTHE CONSIDERATION OF THE RATE OF INTEREST BEING SECONDARY TO THE SAFETY OF THE INVESTMENT THIS IS RECOGNIZED BY THE GREAT EXCHANGES WHERE ALL MANNER OF STOCKS AND BONDS ARE BOUGHT AND SOLD THESE COMPEL THE FREQUENT 64HARMONIZING LABOR AND CAPITAL PUBLICATION OF THE EARNINGS AND GENERAL BUSINESS OF THOSE CORPORA TIONS THAT DESIRE TO HAVE LISTED ANY OF THEIR ISSUES OF SECURITIES NO ONE CAN SAY WITH TRUTH THAT PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE OF THE AFFAIRS OF ANY SUCH CORPORATION HAS IMPERILED THE PROPER OPERATION AND LEGITIMATE SUCCESS OF THE ENTERPRISE ON THE CONTRARY EXPERIENCE HAS PROVEN THE WISDOM OF SUCH A COURSE FROM EVERY STANDPOINTTHE PUBLIC IS BETTER PROTECTED IN ITS INVESTMENTS OF CAPITAL AND SUCH CORPORATIONS ARE GIVEN A STANDING IN THE FINANCIAL WORLD NOT ACCORDED TO THOSE WHO KEEP THEIR AFFAIRS SECRET AND GUARDED FROM THE PUBLIC VIEW WE ARE COMPELLED TO INFER THAT THE NEGATIVE ACTION ON THE PART OF THESE LATTER CONCERNS IS PROMPTED BY ONE OF TWO REASONS EITHER THEY ARE STRIVING TO SECURE A HIGHER CREDIT RATING THAN THAT TO WHICH THEIR ACTUAL CONDITION WOULD ENTITLE THEM OR MORE PROBABLY THAT THEY FEAR THEIR PERCENTAGE OF NET PROFITS IS LARGER THAN PUBLIC SENTI MENT WOULD REGARD WITH FAVOR IT WOULD SEEM IN EITHER CASE THAT THE INTERESTED PUBLIC IS MORALLY ENTITLED TO FREQUENT AND INTELLIGIBLE INFORMATION REGARDING ALL CORPORATIONS WHICH OWE THEIR VERY EXIST ENCE TO THE PUBLIC CONSENT WHAT IS TRUE OF CORPORATIONS IS TRUE OF INDIVIDUAL PARTNER SHIPS AS WELL TO LET THE INTERESTED PUBLIC HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUE STATE OF AFFAIRS WOULD DOUBTLESS BE VERY DISTASTEFUL TO ALL CLASSES OF MASTERS AND YET IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE THAT CONDITIONS STILL LESS AGREEABLE MAY CONFRONT THE MASTERS IF THE DEMANDS FOR JUSTICE TO WAGEEARNERS ARE IGNORED WOULD NOT THE PUBLICATION OF FIGURES COVERING THE ASSETS LIABILITIES AND EARNINGS OR LOSSES PLACE ALL BUSINESS UPON A FIRMER FOUNDATION AND EXERT A HELPFUL INFLUENCE ON THE ADJUSTMENT OF PROFITS BETWEEN CAPITAL BRAINS SKILL AND LABOR IS THE WITHHOLDING OF TRUTH AN ESTABLISHED VIRTUE AND THE PUBLICA TION OF TRUTH A DANGEROUS EXPERIMENT AND FINALLY IF THE INTRODUC TION OF PROFITSHARING INTO A BUSINESS NECESSITATES THE PUBLICATION OF THE EARNINGS OF THE BUSINESS WOULD IT NOT BE FAIR TO ASK THE FEW MASTERS TO MAKE THAT CONCESSION TO THE INTERESTS OF THE MANY WORKERS  BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS ARE COMPOSED OF TWO CLASSESTHOSE WHO OWN AND CONTROL AND THOSE WHO OPERATE AND PRODUCE OR RATHER THOSE WHO CONTRIBUTE THEIR MONEY AND THOSE WHO CONTRIBUTE THEIR LIVES WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY MORAL LAW THAT DENIES THAT THE MAN WHO MAKES HIS CONTRIBUTION OF FLESH AND BLOOD IN WORKBE IT IN STOKING A FIRE RUNNING AN ENGINE OPERATING A TYPEWRITER SELLING GOODS OR DRIVING A TRUCKIS JUSTLY ENTITLED TO AS FULL A KNOWLEDGETHE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF THE PECUNIARY RESULT OF HIS LABOR AS THE MAN WHO MERELY LOANS CAPITAL TO THE OPERATION THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPLES MAY BE SET DOWN AS SUFFICIENTLY WELL ESTABLISHED TO BE USED AS A BASIS FOR WORKING OUT PLANS FOR THE REFORM OF PREVAILING RELATIONS OF LABOR AND CAPITAL A THAT WHENEVER THERE IS SUFFICIENT CONFIDENCE ON THE PART OF THE EMPLOYEES A DIRECT OR AN INDIRECT DIVIDEND TO LABOR IS A GOOD INVESTMENT FOR CAPITAL B THAT WITH AN ACTUAL DIVIDENDEARNING INTEREST IN THE BUSI NESS EVERY PARTICIPANT WOULD BE PROMPTED TO INDIVIDUAL EFFORTS IST TOWARDS ACCOMPLISHING MORE WORK IN A GIVEN LENGTH OF TIME 2D IN THE SAVING OF WASTE 3D IN SEEKING AND SUGGESTING IMPROVEMENTS IN THE MANUFACTURE AND IN THE CONDUCT OF THE BUSI NESS LOOKING TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE GENERAL WELFARE 4TH IN THAT IT WOULD NATURALLY BECOME THE SELFIMPOSED DUTY OF EVERY EMPLOYEE TO CHALLENGE A COWORKER FOR LAZINESS OR UPON THE COMMIS SION OR OMISSION OF ANY ACT THROUGH WHICH A LOSS TO THE BUSINESS WOULD BE THE LIKELY RESULT AND THEREFORE C THAT CAPITAL IN BUSINESS IS BEST SECURED WHEN EVERY EM PLOYEE IS PECUNIARILY BENEFITED THROUGH THE ENLARGED SUCCESS OF THE ENTERPRISE IT IS A FALSE THEORY THAT CAPITAL SHALL NOT ACCUMULATE OR THAT THE RETURN UPON IT SHALL BE RESTRICTED WITHIN DEFINITE LIMITS THERE MUST BE ALLOWED TO CAPITAL THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ENLARGING RETURNS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW ENTERPRISESA CHANCE TO EARN MORE BY RISKING MORE OTHERWISE THERE WILL BE NO INCENTIVE FOR ITS BROADER OPERATIONS AND ITS USEFULNESS WILL BE RESTRICTED THAT CAPITAL IS ACCUMULATED IN THE HANDS OF THE COMPARATIVELY FEW IS NOT GEN ERALLY SPEAKING AN ACCIDENT BUT RATHER THAT FACT IS A STRONG INDICA TION THAT THOSE WHO CONTROL IT ARE THE MEN BEST QUALIFIED TO HOLD IT INTACT AND MAKE IT MOST PRODUCTIVE BESIDES THE ELEMENTS OF CAPITAL AND LABOR THE MATTER OF BRAINS OR BUSINESS SAGACITY MUST BE RECOGNIZED AS AN INDISPENSABLE FACTOR IN BUSINESS AND MUST BE RECKONED WITH THE PECULIAR ABILITY THAT A CERTAIN SMALL PERCENTAGE OF MEN POSSESS TO CONDUCT MODERN BUSINESS VENTURES AT A PROFIT IS OF GREAT VALUE IS ALWAYS IN URGENT DEMAND AND MUST BE WELL PAID FOR LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE IT WILL NATURALLY SEEK FOR ITSELF THE BEST MARKET AND WILL GENERALLY GO TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER THERE CAN BE LITTLE DOUBT THAT THE NEGLECT TO 66HARMONIZING LABOR AND CAPITAL RECOGNIZE AND PROPERLY CARE FOR THIS ELEMENT AS ESSENTIAL TO SUCCESS HAS BEEN LARGELY THE DIRECT CAUSE OF THE MANY FAILURES OF PURELY COOPERATIVE VENTURES BRAINS MUST BE PAID FOR SAGACITY MUST HAVE ITS REWARD AMONGST THE MANY OBSTACLES WHICH CONFRONT ANY EFFORT TO ARRIVE AT SOME FAIR BASIS FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF PROFITSHARING INSTITUTIONS PROBABLY THE MOST PROMINENT IS THE DIFFICULTY OF ESTAB LISHING A SATISFACTORY SYSTEM FOR CALCULATING AND TREATING THE PROFITS AND LOSSES OF THE BUSINESS SO AS TO AVOID THE ELEMENT OF SUSPICION ON THE PART OF THE EMPLOYEES AS TO THE FAIRNESS OF THE BOOKKEEPING EMPLOYED IN ARRIVING AT THE BASIS FOR THE DIVISION TO THEM PROVIDED FOR IN THE AGREEMENT MANY HONEST EFFORTS OF EMPLOYERS TO INTRO DUCE PLANS FOR A DISTRIBUTION AMONGST THE EMPLOYEES OF A PERCENTAGE OF THE NET PROFITS OF THE BUSINESS HAVE BEEN DEFEATED SOLELY BY REASON OF THE INABILITY OF THE MANAGEMENT TO OVERCOME THE DIS TRUST ON THE PART OF THE WAGEEARNERS IN THE BOOKKEEPING IT BEING A SIMPLE ENOUGH MATTER SO TO TREAT THE ACCOUNTS OF PROFITS LOSSES DEPRECIATION OF PLANT AND RECEIVABLES THAT THE PERCENTAGE ACTUALLY DUE THE EMPLOYEES UNDER THE AGREEMENT MAY BE CUT DOWN OR ENTIRELY OBLITERATED AT WILL THE PLAN OF HAVING A DIRECT REPRESENT ATIVE OF THE EMPLOYEES OF THE WATCHDOG ORDER IN THE MANAGEMENT IS NEITHER DESIRABLE NOR LOGICAL THERE MAY BE INDIVIDUAL AND ISOLATED CASES OF PERFECT FAITH AND TRUST ON THE PART OF LABOR TOWARDS CAPITAL BUT AS A BUSINESS PROPOSITION IN THE PRESENT STAGE OF OUR MORAL DEVELOPMENT THERE MUST BE SOMETHING MORE TANGIBLE THAN THE MERE VERBAL ASSURANCES OF THE OWNERS ENDORSED BY AN ACCOUNT ING UNDER THEIR DIRECTION IT IS WITH THE AIM OF PRESENTING A PLAN FOR MEETING IN A MEASURE THIS DIFFICULTY AND AT THE SAME TIME OUTLINING A SCHEME WHICH SHOULD OPERATE TO THE MUTUAL ADVANTAGE OF BOTH CAPITAL AND LABOR WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE SECURITY OF VESTED INTERESTS BUT RATHER STRENGTH ENING IT THAT THE SUGGESTIONS HEREIN CONTAINED ARE SUBMITTEDTHE BASIC PRINCIPLE BEING THAT THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF RIGHTEOUS AMBITION WITH A WELLGROUNDED HOPE FOR FUTURE PROSPERITY MUST SURELY DEVELOP THE BEST THERE IS IN THE WAGEEARNER WITH BENEFIT BOTH TO HIMSELF AND TO CAPITAL AS THE INEVITABLE RESULT IN CONSIDERING THE PROPORTION OF THE NET PROFITS WHICH SHOULD BE PAID OUT IN CASH DIVIDENDS TO CAPITAL FOR ITS USE IT MAY AT LEAST FOR THE SAKE OF PRESENTING THIS ARGUMENT BE COUNTED FAIR TO ASSUME THAT IN THE AVERAGE LEGITIMATE ENTERPRISE THE WITHDRAWAL OF SAY 67THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY 60 PER CENTUM OF THE ACTUAL NET EARNINGS WOULD BE THE LIMIT OF SAFE BUSINESS POLICY AND THAT THE REMAINDER OF SUCH EARNINGS SHOULD BE KEPT IN THE BUSINESS FOR THE PURPOSE OF EXTENDING THE ENTERPRISE AND THE MORE SECURELY PROTECTING THE INVESTMENT AS AN OUTLINE FOR A PLAN FOR THE PROPOSED ADJUSTMENT IN A CONCERN ALREADY ESTABLISHED THE PROPOSITION IS THAT A BINDING AGREEMENT SHALL BE ENTERED INTO WHICH SHALL PROVIDE FOR THE PAYMENT OF THE REGU LAR STANDARD OF CASH WAGES TO ALL EMPLOYEES OF THE CONCERN INCLUD ING THE OFFICIALS AND MANAGEMENTAND SHALL LIKEWISE NAME A DEFINITE AMOUNT WHICH SHALL BE DETERMINED TO BE A JUST AND FAIR ANNUAL RE TURN TO CAPITAL FOR ITS SIMPLE USE NOT HOWEVER EXCEEDING SAY 60 PER CENT OF THE AVERAGE ESTABLISHED NET EARNINGS THAT THE AGREED AMOUNT SHALL BE PAID ANNUALLY IN QUARTERLY OR HALFYEARLY INSTAL MENTS AS A DIVIDEND UPON THE COMMON STOCK OF THE CORPORATION CUMULATIVELY THAT IT SHALL BE ESPECIALLY UNDERSTOOD THAT THE COM PANY BY A TWOTHIRDS VOTE OF ITS COMMON STOCKHOLDERS MAY ISSUE FOR NEEDED ADDITIONAL CAPITAL PREFERRED STOCK THAT THE PRIOR RIGHT TO SUBSCRIBE TO SUCH PREFERRED STOCK SHALL BE PRORATED ONEHALF OF THE ISSUE TO THE HOLDERS OF COMMON STOCK AND THE OTHER ONEHALF TO THE HOLDERS OF THE DEBENTURE BOOKS HEREINAFTER PARTICULARLY SET FORTH IN PROPORTION TO THE PAR VALUE OF THE RESPECTIVE HOLDINGS THAT WAGES SHALL BE A FIRST CLAIM UPON THE ASSETS AND THAT THE DIVIDENDS TO CAPITAL STOCK SHALL HAVE THE FIRST CLAIM UPON THE NET EARNINGS AND THAT THEY SHALL BE CUMULATIVE AT A RATE FIXED BY AGREEMENT THAT AFTER THE PAYMENT OF SUCH DIVIDENDS AS A FIRST CHARGE UPON THE NET PROFITS OF THE BUSINESS 20 PER CENT OF THE NET PROFITS THEN REMAINING SHALL BE SET ASIDE IN A CONTINGENT FUND TO BE HEREAFTER SPECIFICALLY REFERRED TO AND THAT THE BALANCE OF THE ANNUAL NET PROFITS STILL REMAINING SHALL BE HELD IN THE BUSINESSBUT ONEHALF THEREOF FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE STOCKHOLDERS AND THE OTHER ONEHALF FOR THE EM PLOYEES UNDER CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS AND AGREEMENTS TO BE EXPLAINED PRESENTLY IT WILL BE READILY SEEN THAT THE ABOVE TREATMENT OF THE ANNUAL NET PROFITS WOULD CONTINUE THE ACCUMULATION IN THE BUSINESS OF THE SURPLUS EARNINGS IN EXCESS OF THE REGULAR CASH DIVIDENDS AND SO INCREASE AS NOW THE SECURITY OF THE ORIGINAL INVESTMENT AND AS HEREINAFTER SHOWN IN NO WAY DIMINISH OR ENDANGER THE PRESENT POWER OF THE STOCKHOLDERS TO CONTROL THE MANAGEMENT OF THE CONCERN TO ACCOMPLISH THIS IT IS PROPOSED THAT AFTER THE REGULAR CASH DIVIDENDS HAVE BEEN PAID TO CAPITAL AND THE SAID PERCENTAGE SET 68HARMONIZING LABOR AND CAPITAL ASIDE FOR THE CONTINGENT FUND ANNUAL STOCK DIVIDENDS SHALL BE DECLARED COVERING THE AMOUNT OF THE SURPLUS EARNINGS WHICH ARE TO BE HELD IN THE BUSINESS THAT THE CERTIFICATES ISSUED THEREFOR SHALL BE IN THE NATURE OF DEFERRED STOCK DEBENTURES WHICH SHALL HAVE NO VOTING POWER AND SHALL BE SUBORDINATE IN EVERY RESPECT TO THE COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK OF THE CONCERN BOTH AS TO DIVIDENDS AND PRINCIPAL SO THAT SAID DEFERRED STOCK DEBENTURES SHALL NOT BE ENTITLED TO ANY DIVIDEND OR INTEREST WHATSOEVER EXCEPT WHEN EARNED DURING THE THEN CURRENT YEAR AND NOT UNTIL AFTER THE DIVIDENDS UPON ANY PREFERRED STOCK SHALL HAVE BEEN PAID OR SET ASIDE NOR UNTIL THE SAID AGREED SUM EQUAL TO 60 PER CENTUM OF THE ESTAB LISHED AVERAGE NET EARNINGS SHALL HAVE BEEN PAID OUT OR SET ASIDE FOR THE DIVIDENDS UPON THE COMMON STOCK AND SAID CONTRIBUTION MADE TO THE CONTINGENT FUND THAT THE SAID DEFERRED STOCK DEBEN TURES SHALL RECEIVE DIVIDENDS AT A RATE NOT EXCEEDING 6 PER CENT PER ANNUM WHEN EARNED IN THE THEN CURRENT YEAR AND IN NO SENSE SHALL SAID DIVIDENDS BE CUMULATIVE THAT IN THE EVENT OF LIQUIDATION OR DISSOLUTION THE COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK SHALL BE PAID IN FULL BEFORE ANY PAYMENT SHALL BE MADE UPON THE SAID DEFERRED STOCK DEBENTURES BUT SAID DEFERRED STOCK DEBENTURES SHALL THEN RECEIVE ALL OF THE ASSETS REMAINING AFTER THE PAYMENT IN FULL OF THE PREFERRED AND COMMON STOCK AND OF ALL OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS AND THAT THE SAID DEFERRED STOCK DEBENTURES SHALL ALWAYS BE SUBORDINATE TO THE GENERAL CREDITORS OF THE COMPANY1 THESE DEFERRED STOCK DEBENTURES SHALL ALL BE ISSUED TO A TRUSTEE ONEHALF THEREOF TO BE HELD IN TRUST FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND THE OTHER ONEHALF SHALL BE CONSIDERED AS EXTRA WAGES AND SHALL BE HELD BY SAID TRUSTEE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE EM PLOYEES CASH DIVIDENDS ON ALL DEFERRED STOCK DEBENTURES WHEN DECLARED SHALL BE PAID TO SAID TRUSTEE WHO SHALL DISBURSE THE SAME ONEHALF THEREOF TO THE HOLDERS OF THE COMMON STOCK PRO RATA AND THE OTHER ONEHALF TO THE EMPLOYEES IN PROPORTION TO THE RESPECTIVE AMOUNTS STANDING TO THEIR CREDIT ON THEIR DEBENTURE BOOKS HERE INAFTER DESCRIBED THAT IS TO SAY FOR ILLUSTRATION THAT IF THE CAPITAL OF THE CONCERN IS IOOOOOO AND THE NET EARNINGS FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS HAVE LWE HAVE ASSURANCES FROM EMINENT CORPORATION ATTORNEYS THAT THE PROPOSED ISSUE OF DEFERRED STOCK WITH THE SUGGESTED LIMITATIONS THEREON IS ENTIRELY LEGAL AND FEASIBLE AND THAT IT CAN BE DONE WITHOUT DANGER OF HAVING THE CONCERN FORCED INTO A COURT OF EQUITY BY THE HOLDERS OF SUCH CERTIFICATES 69THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY AVERAGED 200000 PER ANNUM60 PER CENT OF SUCH EARNINGS OR I20000 WOULD BE THE AMOUNT AGREED UPON AS THE ANNUAL CASH DIVIDEND TO CAPITAL REPRESENTED BY THE COMMON STOCKTHAT 20 PER CENT OF THE BALANCE OF SUCH EARNINGS OR SAY I6000 WOULD BE THE AMOUNT TO BE PAID INTO THE CONTINGENT FUND AND THAT AT THE END OF THE FIRST YEAR OF THE OPERATION OF THE PLAN THE BALANCE OR SUM OF SAY 64000 WOULD BE HELD IN THE BUSINESS BUT THAT DEFERRED STOCK DEBENTURES TO COVER SAID AMOUNT WOULD BE ISSUED TO THE TRUSTEE32000 TO BE HELD FOR THE USE OF THE STOCKHOLDERS AND 32000 AS EXTRA WAGES TO BE HELD FOR THE EMPLOYEES AT THE END OF THE SECOND YEAR AFTER THE PAYMENT OF THE DIVIDENDS TO COMMON STOCK AND THE PERCENTAGE TO CONTINGENT FUND A DIVIDEND WOULD THEN BE DECLARED UPON 64000 OF DEFERRED STOCK DEBENTURES AND FOR THE BALANCE OF THE NET PROFITS STILL REMAINING ANOTHER ISSUE OF DEFERRED STOCK DEBENTURES WOULD BE MADE TO SAID TRUSTEE AND SO ON FROM YEAR TO YEAR THE EFFECT OF THE ABOVE ARRANGEMENT BEING THAT AFTER THE PAY MENT OF ALL CASH DIVIDENDS TO COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK AND THE SETTING ASIDE OF THE SAID PERCENTAGE TO THE CONTINGENT FUND THE SURPLUS EARNINGS THEN REMAININGREPRESENTING THE SURPLUS ASSETS OF THE COMPANYWOULD BE CAPITALIZED IN THE FORM OF DEFERRED STOCK DEBENTURES AND HELD IN TRUST FOR THE JOINT INTERESTS OF THE ORIGINAL OWNERS OR THEIR ASSIGNS AND THE EMPLOYEESIT BEING ESPECIALLY PROVIDED THAT SHOULD THE COMPANY AT ANY TIME OR TIMES PREFER TO PAY THE AMOUNT OF SURPLUS EARNINGS IN CASH DIRECTLY TO THE STOCKHOLDERS AND

ISSUED TO THE TRUSTEE AS WAGES SHALL BE CALCULATED AS ABOVE OUTLINED AND THE PERCENTAGE THEREOF IN WHICH EACH INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEE IS INTERESTED SHALL BE DETERMINED BY THE PROPORTION THAT HIS WAGES FOR THE YEAR SHALL BEAR TO THE WHOLE SALARY LIST FOR THAT PERIOD THIS AMOUNT THEN SHALL BE SET DOWN IN HIS DEBENTURE BOOK AND UPON THIS SUM HE WILL BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE THROUGH THE TRUSTEE WHEN EARNED DIVIDENDS NOT EXCEEDING 6 PER CENT PER ANNUM NONCUMULATIVELY AND SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS SET FORTH IN AND MADE A PART OF HIS DEBENTURE BOOK AS HEREINAFTER PARTICULARLY SET FORTH THE FEES OF THE

THAT IN CASE OF THE DEATH OF THE HOLDER THEREOF THE SAME SHALL FORM A PART OF HIS ESTATE AND SHALL BE CONVERTIBLE INTO CASH 71THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY AT ITS PAR VALUE WITHIN THIRTY DAYS UPON APPLICATION TO THE COM PANY AND THE SAME SHALL BE PAID FOR OUT OF AND HELD BY THE CON TINGENT FUND WHEN THE BALANCE IN SAID FUND WILL SO PERMIT OTHER WISE TO BE PAID FOR OUT OF THE GENERAL UNDS OF THE COMPANY AND HELD IN THE TREASURY H THAT SAID DEBENTURE BOOK SHALL NOT BE TRANSFERABLE WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE COMPANY I THAT IT SHALL BE ESPECIALLY UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED THAT ALL

ISSUES OF STOCK THE AMOUNT TO BE SET ASIDE TO THE CONTINGENT FUND SHALL BE PAID IN CASH AND MAY BE INVESTED IN LEGAL AND MARKETABLE SECURI TIES THIS FUND SHALL BE HELD IN THE FIRST PLACE TO MAKE GOOD TO THE COMPANY ANY EXCESSIVE BUSINESS LOSSES THAT CANNOT BE MET OUT OF 72HARMONIZING LABOR AND CAPITAL THE CURRENT PROFITS OF THE CONCERN IT WILL ALSO PURCHASE AT PAR THE DEBENTURE BOOKS OF DECEASED EMPLOYEES AND ANY ACCUMULATION OF INCOME THEREIN SHALL BE USED AS A BASIS FOR SICK BENEFITS ETC UPON SUCH A UNIFORM PLAN AS THE AMOUNTS THEREOF WILL WARRANT THE DIS POSITION OF THE AVAILABLE INCOME FOR THAT PURPOSE TO BE PLACED AS LARGELY AS PRACTICABLE IN THE HANDS OF THE EMPLOYEES THE PROPOSITION IS THAT THE ABOVE TREATMENT OF PROFITS SHALL BE CONTINUED ANNUALLY FROM YEAR TO YEAR SO THAT AT THE END OF THE SECOND YEAR OF ITS OPERATIONAFTER THE PAYMENT OF THE REGULAR CASH DIVIDENDS UPON THE COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK OUT OF THAT YEARS NET PROFITS AND THE PAYMENT INTO THE CONTINGENT FUNDTHE DIVI DEND ON THE DEFERRED STOCK DEBENTURES SHALL BE DECLARED AND PAID UPON THE AMOUNT THEREOF HELD BY SAID TRUSTEE AND FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE SURPLUS EARNINGS FOR THE SECOND YEAR ANOTHER ISSUE OF DEFERRED STOCK DEBENTURES SHALL BE MADE TO SAID TRUSTEE ONE HALF FOR THE USE OF THE COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND THE OTHER HALF AS EXTRA WAGES TO BE HELD FOR THE USE OF THE EMPLOYEES AND THAT THE AMOUNT THEREOF TO WHICH EACH EMPLOYEE IS ENTITLED TO CREDIT SHALL AGAIN BE DETERMINED AS ABOVE SET FORTH AND SHALL BE ENTERED IN THE RESPECTIVE DEBENTURE BOOKS AND ADDED TO THE AMOUNTS OF THE PREVIOUS SIMILAR CREDIT AND SO ON FROM YEAR TO YEAR IT BEING PRO VIDED AS ABOVE SET FORTH THAT IN CASE THE COMPANY COULD NOT MAKE ADVANTAGEOUS USE OF THIS INCREASE OF CAPITAL IT SHALL HAVE THE OPTION OF DISBURSING THE AMOUNT IN CASH DIRECT TO THE EMPLOYEE AND STOCK HOLDERS COULD THE MASTERS MANIPULATE THE BOOKKEEPING SO AS TO FLEECE THE EMPLOYEES OF THE PERCENTAGE OF PROFITS TO WHICH THEY WERE ACTUALLY ENTITLED THE WRITER BELIEVES THAT THIS COULD NOT BE AND FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS A IT WILL BE SEEN THAT UNDER THE PLAN AS SUGGESTED WHATEVER ACTION THE MANAGEMENT MIGHT TAKE REGARDING THE VALUATION OF THE ASSETS AND CALCULATION OF THE ANNUAL PROFITS ITS DECISION WOULD BEAR EQUALLY UPON THE INTERESTS OF THE STOCKHOLDERS AND OF THE EMPLOYEES B IF THE MANAGEMENT IS OVERLY CONSERVATIVE AND THE ACTUAL SURPLUS ASSETS ARE THEREBY CUT DOWN THE STOCK DIVIDEND TO THE TRUSTEE REPRESENTING BOTH THE EMPLOYEES AND THE STOCKHOLDERS WOULD BE FOR THAT YEAR UNDULY DIMINISHED BUT SUCH ACTION COULD MAKE LITTLE OR NO DIFFERENCE IN THE FINAL RESULT AS THE ACTUAL SURPLUS ASSETS WOULD STILL BE INTACT AND IF NOT SHOWN IN ONE YEAR WOULD SURELY APPEAR IN ANOTHER SO THAT BEYOND A DELAY IN THE DIVISION 73THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY THEREOF THOSE IN CONTROL OF THE BOOKKEEPING WOULD BE POWERLESS TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THE EMPLOYEES AND AS ALREADY SHOWN AN UNFAIR SETTLEMENT WOULD BEAR EQUALLY UPON CAPITAL AND LABOR THEN TOO C THERE COULD BE LITTLE OR NO OBJECT IN SUCH AN ATTEMPT AS IT IS NOT INTENDED THAT THE SURPLUS WHATEVER THE AMOUNT MAY BE SHALL BE WITHDRAWN FROM THE BUSINESS AND DISTRIBUTED BUT THAT THE WHOLE OF THE SAME SHALL BE RETAINED IN THE BUSINESS SO LONG AS IT CAN BE USED ADVANTAGEOUSLY AND UNDER THE PLAN AS OUTLINED ALL OF THESE SURPLUS EARNINGS SHALL BE CAPITALIZED AND SUBORDINATED TO THE ORIGINAL INVESTMENT AND THUS ACTING PRACTICALLY AS A GUARANTEE FUND TO PROTECT AND SECURE THE SAME AND AGAIN D IT IS A PART OF THE PLAN THAT ALL EMPLOYEES FROM THE LOWEST FORM OF UNSKILLED LABOR TO THE HIGHEST SALARIED OFFICIAL SHALL BE SHARERS IN THE DIVIDEND TO WAGES UNDER SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT IT WOULD BE PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE OWNERS TO EQUIVOCATE OR TO TREAT THE QUESTION UNFAIRLY IT WILL BE GENERALLY CONCEDED THAT THE UNIVERSAL PUBLICATION OF THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ALL BUSINESS ENTERPRISES WOULD GREATLY SIMPLIFY AND PROPORTIONATELY STIMULATE TRADE WITH THE ADDED SECURITY AGAINST LOSSES THAT SUCH A SYSTEM WOULD ASSURE A LIBERAL EXTENSION OF CREDITS WOULD BE THE NATURAL AND A SAFE OUTCOME IT IS MORE DIFFICULT HOWEVER TO MEET THE QUESTION AS TO WHAT EFFECT THE PUBLICATION OF THE EARNINGS DEBTS AND RESOURCES WOULD HAVE UPON THE CREDIT AND GENERAL BUSINESS OF A SINGLE CONCERN WHEN IN DIRECT COMPETITION WITH OTHERS IN THE SAME CLASS WHICH CONTINUED TO HOLD TO THE SYSTEM OF SECRECY IT IS CLEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE A CON CLUSIVE STATEMENT CONCERNING THIS QUESTION WHETHER THE PUBLI CATION OF ACCOUNTS BY ONE CONCERN WOULD WORK TO THE ADVANTAGE OR DISADVANTAGE OF ITS SECRETIVE COMPETITORS SEEMS WHOLLY PROB LEMATICAL SO FAR AS WE CAN SEE HOWEVER INDICATIONS POINT WITH SOME CONFIDENCE TO THE ULTIMATE SUCCESS OF THAT CONCERN WHICH DOES NOT CONCEAL THAT OF WHICH THEIR CREDITORS OF A RIGHT SHOULD BE INFORMED REGARDING THE PROBABLE EFFECT UPON THE GENERAL BUSINESS OF THE CONCERN IT SEEMS REASONABLE TO CLAIM THAT THE LIBERAL AND JUST TREATMENT OF THE EMPLOYEES WILL SURELY APPEAL TO THE PUBLIC AT LARGE AND THAT THE ADVANTAGE GAINED THROUGH THE PROFITABLE INFLUENCE THAT SUCH ACTION WILL HAVE UPON THE CONCERNS CONSTITUENCY ESPE CIALLY AMONG THE BUYING PUBLIC WOULD LARGELY OVERBALANCE ANY 74HARMONIZING LABOR AND CAPITAL POSSIBLE DISADVANTAGE THAT COULD COME AS A RESULT OF THE EXPOSITION OF FIGURES REGARDING THE CONDITION OF ITS AFFAIRS AS TO THE EFFECT ON CREDIT WHEN THE PUBLISHED EARNINGS SHOW A DECREASE IN PROFITS IT IS STILL DIFFICULT TO DO MORE THAN SURMISE THOUGH IF THE LIABILITIES OF THE ENTERPRISE ARE MADE UP MORE AND MORE EACH YEAR IN A GROWING PERCENTAGE OF SUBORDINATED INCOMEDEBENTURES WE BELIEVE THE PUBLICATION OF DECREASED PROFITS WOULD NOT OPERATE TOWARDS THE IMPAIRMENT OF ITS CREDIT AND CERTAINLY NOT UNTIL THE LOSSES BECAME SO EXTENSIVE AS TO IMPERIL THE SOLVENCY OF THE CONCERN IN WHICH LATTER CASE IT SEEMS CLEAR TO US THAT LITTLE CAN BE JUSTLY SAID IN SUPPORT OF THE CUSTOM OF CONCEALMENT WOULD THE PLAN OF LETTING THE EMPLOYEES GENERALLY BECOME PART OWNERS OF THE CONCERN PLACE THEM IN A POSITION TO GIVE TROUBLE TO THE MANAGEMENT OF THE ENTERPRISE AND WOULD THEY NOT SOON DEMAND AS STOCKHOLDERS THE RIGHT TO A VOICE IN THE DIRECTION OF ITS AFFAIRS AND IN THE SHAPING OF ITS POLICY ON THE CONTRARY IT IS URGED A THAT WITH THE PROPER AND TIMELY GUARDING OF THE INTERESTS OF THE ORIGINAL INVESTMENT THROUGH SUFFICIENT CLEAR AND UNDENIABLE LIMITATIONS UPON THE RIGHTS AND POWERS CARRIED WITH THE ISSUES OF DEFERRED STOCK SUCH ISSUES COULD NOT BE USED TO THE DETRIMENT OF VESTED INTERESTS BUT RATHER B THAT SUCH A PECUNIARY INTEREST IN THE ENLARGED SUCCESS OF THE BUSINESS WOULD ACT AS A GUARANTEE OF LOYALTY TO THE MANAGE MENT AND AS AN INCENTIVE TO THE EMPLOYEES TO FURTHER THE LEGITIMATE BUSINESS OF THE CONCERN AND C THAT THE EMPLOYEES WITH A MONEY INVESTMENT IN THE ENTERPRISE IF FOR NO HIGHER REASON THAN THE INSTINCT OF SELFPRESERVA TION WOULD REALIZE THE VALUE AND NECESSITY FOR HARMONIOUS AND SYMPATHETIC COOPERATION BETWEEN THE CAPITAL BRAINS AND ENERGY OF THE CONCERN WOULD CAPITAL BE BENEFITED BY THE OPERATION WE CLAIM WITHOUT RESERVATION THAT IT WOULDAND FOR THE FOLLOWINGREASONS A THAT THE NET PROFITS OF THE BUSINESS WOULD BE LARGELY INCREASED THROUGH THE REDUCTION OF FRICTION THE LARGER INCENTIVE OF LABOR THE INCREASE IN THE PHYSICAL CAPACITY OF THE WORKERS TO PRODUCE THE SAVING OF USELESS WASTE AND THROUGH THE ABSENCE OF STRIKES AND LOCKOUTS AS IN ALL OF SUCH INCREASE IN NET PROFITS THE CAPITAL WOULD BE AN EQUAL SHARER WITH ITS EMPLOYEES B THAT THE TRUE LOYALTY AND SUPPORT OF ALL EMPLOYEES WOULD 75THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY GREATLY STRENGTHEN THE SECURITY OF THE CAPITAL IN THE BUSINESS AND PROPORTIONATELY ADD TO THE REAL VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT C THAT WHERE ADVERSE LEGISLATION MAY BE EASY OF ACCOM PLISHMENT WHEN IT ATTACKS THE INTERESTS OF ONE MAN OR A SMALL BODY OF MEN IT WOULD BE QUITE A DIFFERENT MATTER WHERE THE INTERESTS OF ALL EMPLOYEES ARE INVOLVED D THAT THE SURPLUS PROFITS WOULD NOT BE PAID OUT AND DIS TRIBUTED BUT WOULD BE HELD IN THE BUSINESS SUBORDINATED TO THE CLAIMS OF THE ORIGINAL INVESTMENT AND SO VERY MATERIALLY ADDING TO THE SECURITY THEREOF E THAT WITH A PROPERTY INTEREST IN THE BUSINESS THE TENDENCY OF THE OPERATIVES TO SHIFT FROM ONE CONCERN TO ANOTHER WITHOUT REAL PURPOSE WOULD BE REDUCED TO THE MINIMUM AND THAT THE CONSE QUENT ADVANTAGE TO THE MANAGEMENT WOULD RESULT IN A DISTINCT GAIN IN THE STABILITY OF THE BUSINESS WOULD SUCH A PLAN WHEN PERFECTED SUCCEED IF IT WOULD INCREASE THE PRODUCTIVITY OF THE WORKERS IF IT WOULD TEND TO ELEVATE CHARACTER TO DEVELOP A GREATER LOYALTY TO THE CONCERN AND HELP TO CHANGE AN OPERATIVE FROM AN AUTOMATON INTO A MAN IF IT WOULD STRENGTHEN THE SECURITY OF VESTED INTERESTS AND NARROW THE GULF BETWEEN WEALTH AND WORK AND FINALLY IF IT WOULD BE IN THE DIRECTION OF RIGHTEOUSNESS AND JUSTICE IT MUST FINALLY SUCCEED IT CANNOT BE EXPECTED THAT AT FIRST THE INTRODUCTION OF SUCH A SCHEME WOULD BE RECEIVED BY THE OPERATIVES WITH ENTHUSIASM IT WOULD ONLY BE THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF THEIR MORE INTELLIGENT LEADERS THAT THEY COULD BE ASSURED OF ITS BENEFITS AND ONLY AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF SUCCESSFUL OPERATION COULD WE EXPECT IT TO RECEIVE THE UNQUALIFIED SUPPORT OF THE WORKERS WHEN HOWEVER THEIR CAPITALIZED EXTRA WAGES SHOW AN ACCUMULATION AND THEY BEGIN TO RECEIVE ANNUAL CASH DIVIDENDS UPON THE SURPLUS EARNINGS OF PREVIOUS YEARS WE MAY BE REASONABLY ASSURED OF A DECIDED CHANGE OF SENTIMENT IN ITS FAVOR IN THE MEANWHILE THE MASTERS WOULD DO WELL IN AVOIDING UNDUE ANTAGONISM TO LABOR ORGANIZATIONS PER SE SO FAR AS THE LARGE BODY OF WAGEEARNERS IS CONCERNED THE BENEFITS OF PROFITSHARING ARE STILL TO THEM UNPROVEN WHILE THE TRADE UNION HAS IN MANY WAYS DEMON STRATED ITS USEFULNESS IN PROTECTING THE INTERESTS OF ITS MEMBERS WHETHER IT DOES MORE REALLY TO HELP THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE WORKER THAN TO HINDER MAY BE AN OPEN QUESTION HOWEVER THIS MAY BE CERTAIN IT IS THAT THE INSTITUTION IS STRONGLY ESTABLISHED IN THE MIND OF THE WORKMAN AS HIS STRONGEST FRIEND HIS ONE MEANS OF EXPRESSION 76HARMONIZING LABOR AND CAPITAL AND HIS ONLY HOPE OF MATERIAL SALVATION IN ITS REVERSES AS WELL AS IN ITS SUCCESSES HIS HEART WILL REMAIN LOYAL TO HIS UNION UNTIL HE SHALL HAVE BEEN FURNISHED A SUBSTITUTE WHICH HAS PROVEN TO HIM ITS LARGER USEFULNESS IN VIEW OF THE INCREASING TENDENCY TO INCORPORATE BUSINESS THIS PAPER HAS TREATED THE QUESTION AS IT RELATES TO ORGANIZED CAPITAL IT IS NEVERTHELESS CLEARLY TRUE THAT THE SAME GENERAL SITUATION OBTAINS IN THE STRICTLY PARTNERSHIP CONCERNS AND THAT THE PRINCIPLES HEREIN SUGGESTED COULD BE THE MORE READILY APPLIED IN SUCH CASES ESPECIALLY AS THE POWER TO ACT IS CONCENTRATED IN THE HANDS OF A FEW INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE NO ONE ELSE TO CONSULT IN SUCH A CASE IT IS SUGGESTED IN PLACE OF THE ISSUE OF THE DE FERRED STOCK DEBENTURES THAT THE SURPLUS NET EARNINGSAFTER THE PAYMENT OF THE AGREED INTEREST TO CAPITAL AND THE ASSIGNMENT IN CASH OF THE PERCENTAGE TO CONTINGENT FUNDSHALL BE CREDITED TO A MUTUAL RESERVE FUND WHICH FUND SHALL TAKE THE PLACE OF THE PROPOSED TRUSTEE IN A STOCK COMPANY AND SHALL BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE DIVIDENDS OR INTEREST UPON THE SAME TERMS AND SUBJECT TO THE SAME LIMITATIONS PROVIDED FOR THE DEFERRED STOCK DEBENTURES AND THAT SAID FUND SHALL BE HELD FOR THE JOINT AND EQUAL BENEFIT OF CAPITAL AND EMPLOYEESTHE RESPECTIVE INTERESTS OF THE EMPLOYEES TO BE ENTERED IN A PASSBOOK SIMILAR IN TERMS TO THE DEBENTURE BOOKS HEREIN PARTICULARLY DESCRIBED THE PLAN BRIEFLY OUTLINED IS OFFERED AS A SUGGESTION DOUBTLESS EVERY POINT MADE CAN BE IMPROVED BY MODIFICATION OR SUBSTITUTION IF IT INFLUENCES IN A SMALL DEGREE MORE EARNEST THOUGHT ON THE PART OF THOSE IN WHOM THE POWER IS VESTED TOWARDS THE FORMATION OF A COM PREHENSIVE PLAN LOOKING TO A MORE REASONABLE DIVISION OF THE PROD UCT OF ALL AND A FULLER ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE HUMANITY OF MAN ITS PURPOSE WILL HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED 77

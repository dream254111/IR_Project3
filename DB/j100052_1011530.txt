J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1011530,THE YELLOW PINE SITUATION,I242601,THE YELLOW PINE SITUATION1 BY C D JOHINSON FROSTJOHNSON LUMBER CO ST LOUIS MO IT MUST BE EVIDENT TO EVERYONE HERE WHO HAS KEPT PACE WITH AFFAIRS EVEN IF ONLY CASUALLY THAT THIS BROAD AND WEALTHY LAND OF OURS HAS NEVER SEEN A YEAR OF GREATER MATERIAL PROSPERITY THAN THE PRESENT ONE ABUNDANCE AND WEALTH ARE TO BE FOUND EVERYWHERE ESSENTIALLY AN AGRICULTURAL COUNTRY THE BASIS OF ITS PROSPERITY IS AND DOUBTLESS ALWAYS WILL BE THE PRODUCTS OF ITS SOIL RECENT REPORTS ISSUED BY THE GOVERNMENT SHOW THAT THIS YEARS INCREASE IN THE COMBINED YIELD OF THE FIVE LEADING CEREALS VIZ CORN WHEAT OATS BARLEY AND RYE AMOUNTS TO APPROXIMATELY 540OOOOOO BUSHELS OVER LAST YEAR THE YIELD PER ACRE AND THE QUALITY OF THE CROPS ARE BETTER IN ALL CEREAL GROWING STATES THAN THEY HAVE BEEN FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND EVERYWHERE DO THEY EXCEED THE TENYEAR AVERAGE BUT PROSPERITY IS NOTICEABLE ALSO IN OTHER DIRECTIONSTHE HEALTHY CONDITION OF THE IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRY FOR INSTANCE WHICH IN VOLUME OF BUSINESS AND EARNINGS BIDS WELL TO EQUAL IF NOT ECLIPSE 1907 THE BEST YEAR IN ITS HISTORY AND OF THE RAILROADS AS EVIDENCED BY THEIR HEAVY EXPENDITURES MONTH AFTER MONTH FOR MAINTENANCE STRUCTURES AND EQUIPMENTEXPENDITURES FAR IN EXCESS OF THOSE MADE IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THE REPORTS OF RAILROAD EARNINGS ARE HIGHLY SATISFACTORY AND IN THE DAILY PRESS NOW ONE CAN READ NEARLY EVERY DAY OF LARGE ORDERS BEING PLACED FOR RAILS ENGINES AND CARS FACTORIES FOUNDRIES AND MILLS EVERYWHERE HITHERTO RUN NING INDIFFERENTLY HAVE RESUMED NORMAL OPERATIONS AS A DIRECT OR INDIRECT RESULT OF THE COUNTRYS ABUNDANCE FINANCES ARE IN A GOOD WAY AND MONEY IS EXCEEDINGLY CHEAP AND PLENTIFUL THE TENDENCY TO HARASS LARGE CORPORATIONS WITH ADVERSE LEGISLATION SEEMS TO HAVE PASSED AND THERE ARE NO MOMENTOUS POLITICAL QUESTIONS TO DISTURB THE PRESENT SATISFACTORY POSE OF BUSINESS THE TARIFF IS SETTLED AND OUT OF THE WAY AND WILL REMAIN OUT OF THE WAY FOR THE NEXT TEN OR TWELVE YEARS EVERYBODY SEEMS TO BE SATISFIED WITH THE SCHED REPRINTED FROM THE ST LOUIS LUMBERMAN SEPTEMBER 15 1909 532THE YELLOW PINE SITUATION ULES ADOPTED AND BY THIS TIME THE SUBJECT HAS ALMOST CEASED TO BE A TOPIC OF CURRENT DISCUSSION AVERAGE BUSINESS BUT UNSATISFACTORY PRICE UNDER CONDITIONS SO PROSPEROUS THERE IS BOUND TO BE AN AVER AGE AMOUNT OF BUSINESS TRANSACTED IN THE UNITED STATES AND NATURALLY THERE MUST BE AT LEAST AN AVERAGE AMOUNT OF LUMBER USED BUT WHAT DO WE FIND INSTEAD OF MARKETING OUR PRODUCT WITH THE EASE WARRANTED BY THE PREVAILING NORMAL AND HEALTHY CON DITION OF BUSINESS AND AT A PRICE THAT WILL NET US A FAIR RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENTS WE ARE NOW AND FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS HAVE BEEN SELLING THE PRODUCTS OF OUR FORESTS AT AN APPALLINGLY DEMORALIZED PRICEA PRICE WHOLLY UNPROFITABLE THERE ARE OF COURSE REASONS FOR THIS BUT IT DOES SEEM STRANGE THAT A BUSINESS THE SIZE OF OURS RANKING AS IT DOES FOURTH AMONG THE INDUSTRIES OF THE COUNTRY IT DOES SEEM STRANGE THAT IT ALONE AMID ALL THIS GENERAL PROSPERITY SHOULD CONTINUE IN ITS DEMORALIZATION AND WITH SUCH SCANT HOPE OF IMPROVEMENT THERE ARE ONLY TWO OTHER INDUSTRIES THAT OCCUPY ABOUT THE SAME UNENVIABLE POSITION NAMELY THE COAL MINING AND CEMENT INDUSTRIES AND IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT IN EACH CASE THE SAME BASIC PRINCIPLE IS INVOLVED EACH SUCCEEDING YEAR BRINGS AN INCREASE IN THE CROPS OF THE COUNTRY AND EACH SUCCEEDING YEAR BRINGS ALSO AN INCREASE IN PRICES FOR FARM PRODUCTS AT NO TIME IN THE BUSINESS HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY HAS THE FARMER RECEIVED MORE FOR HIS CROPS AND HIS LIVE STOCK THAN HE IS RECEIVING TODAY HIS WEALTH AND THE PURCHASING POWER OF HIS PRODUCTS HAVE MULTIPLIED AMAZINGLY IN THE LAST TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS THE FOLLOWING STORY WHICH I SAW IN A WESTERN NEWSPAPER RECENTLY STRIKINGLY ILLUSTRATES THIS FACT A FARMER BOUGHT A WAGON IN 1894 FOR 6OOO RECENTLY HE NEEDED A NEW WAGON AND WENT TO THE SAME DEALER WHO PRICED HIM THE SAME KIND OF A WAGON AT 70OO THE FARMER OBJECTED TO THE EXTRA IOOO AND DEMANDED A REASON THE MERCHANT REFLECTED A MOMENT AND THEN SAID HE WOULD SELL HIM ON THE SAME TERMS AS THE FIRST ONE YOU PAID FOR THE ONE YOU BOUGHT IN 94 IN CORN AND IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY YOU BROUGHT ME 600 BUSHELS OF CORN AT TEN CENTS A BUSHEL NOW YOU BRING ME 600 BUSHELS OF CORN WELL SAY HOLD ON BEGAN THE FARMER BUT INTERRUPTED THE DEALER YOUR WIFE CAN SELECT A 12500 SURREY YOU CAN HAVE THE BEST SELFBINDER IN THE STORE 533 95THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY WORTH I2500 THEN YOU CAN HAVE AN 8OOO KITCHEN RANGE AND 2OOO WORTH OF KITCHEN FURNITURE ALL FOR 6OO BUSHELS OF CORN THE WAGON AT 70OO AND THE OTHER ITEMS FOOT UP TO 42000 SIX HUN DRED BUSHELS OF CORN AT SEVENTY CENTS A BUSHEL AMOUNT TO 42000 THE FARMER WAS STUNNED AND WITHOUT SAYING ANOTHER WORD ABOUT MONOPOLIES OR THE TARIFF COUNTED OUT 70OO FOR THE WAGON THE VALUE OF THE FARMERS CORN INCREASED SEVENFOLD IN FIFTEEN YEARS BUT HOW HAS THE LUMBERMANS PRODUCT FARED IN THE SAME PERIOD AND WHY FUNDAMENTAL LAW OF TRADE INVOLVED I THINK WE ALL KNOW AND UNDERSTAND THE ONE AND THE ONLY CAUSE FOR THE IMPOTENT CONDITION OF OUR BUSINESS A CAUSE SO ESSEN TIAL THAT IT IS OF ITSELF SUFFICIENT IN A WORD THE DIFFICULTY INVOLVES DIRECTLY THE FUNDAMENTAL LAW OF TRADETHE LAW OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND AS APPLIED TO THE LUMBER INDUSTRY THERE IS AND HAS FOR SEVERAL YEARS BEEN AN OVERPRODUCTION AND LUMBERMEN HAVE NOT YET LEARNED TO FIT THEIR OUTPUT TO THE DEMANDS AND NEEDS OF THE COUNTRY THE MANUFACTURERS IN THE SOUTH FIXED THEIR CAPACITY UNDER THE EXTREMELY PLROSPEROUS CONDITIONS THAT PREVAILED TWO OR THREE YEARS AGOCONDITIONS THAT IN ALL PROBABILITY WE CANNOT EXPECT AGAIN IN THIS COUNTRY FOR A LONG TIME TO COME GOOD TIMES HAVE COME BUT THE PRESENT PROSPERITY IS NORMAL I USE THE WORD NORMAL IN A COMPARATIVE SENSE HAVING IN MIND THE ALMOST UNNATURALLY FLOURISHING CONDITIONS A FEW YEARS SINCE IT WILL BE SOME TIME BEFORE USERS OF MATERIAL PURCHASERS OF EQUIP MENT CONSTRUCTORS OF RAILROADS AND BUILDERS OF VARIOUS KINDS OF ENTERPRISES WILL EXPAND THEIR BUSINESS TO THE EXTENT THEY DID IN THE YEARS 1905 I906 AND I907 THERE IS EVERYWHERE A GREATER CON SERVATISM IN BUSINESS TODAY A TENDENCY TO STAY CLOSER TO SHORE THE FINANCIAL UPHEAVAL OF THE LATTER PART OF 1907 HAS MADE THE GENERAL BUSINESS PUBLIC APPREHENSIVE AND AFRAID OF OWING TOO MUCH MONEY THE CONSUMPTION OF LUMBER IS DIRECTLY AFFECTED AFTER SUCH CONDITIONS THE COUNTRYS WEALTH INCREASES ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ARE STABLE BUSINESS GENERALLY IS GOOD THE DEMAND FOR LUMBER IN CONFORMITY WITH ALL OF THESE IS AVERAGE NO MORE NOR LESS THAN IT CAN REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO BE WHILE THE PRODUCTION OF LUMBER FIXED AT A TIME OF EXTRAORDINARY DEMAND CONTINUES AT THE SAME ENORMOUS RATE IN OTHER WORDS THE MANUFACTURER RIGHT NOW IS 534 96THE YELLOW PINE SITUATION CAPABLE OF MAKING MORE LUMBER THAN THE COUNTRY CAN USE AND HE IS MAKING IT THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE CONSUMPTION OF LUMBER HAS BEEN AFFECTED IN RECENT YEARS BY REVOLUTIONARY METHODS OF BUILDING HAS NOT I THINK BEEP GIVEN THE SERIOUS CONSIDERATION IT DESERVES IN FACT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT MANUFACTURERS OF LUMBER HAVE NEVER LOOKED UPON THE SUBJECT AS ONE OF ANY PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE IN CONNECTION WITH THE QUESTION OF PRODUCTION HOWEVER IT IS BECOMING A FACTOR OF SUCH SIGNIFICANCE THAT IT CANNOT MUCH LONGER BE OVER LOOKED THE TENDENCY IN ALL BRANCHES OF CONSTRUCTION AND IN MOST LINES OF MANUFACTURE IS TO FIND SUBSTITUTES FOR WOOD CONCRETE AND STEEL ARE COMING MORE AND MORE INTO USE EVERY YEAR TAKING THE PLACE WHOLLY OR IN PART THAT WHICH HAS HERETOFORE CALLED FOR LUMBER SUBSTITUTES FOR LUMBER NEARLY ALL MODERN FREIGHT CARS ARE BEING BUILT WITH STEEL UNDER FRAMES GONDOLAS AND COAL CARS BEING MADE ENTIRELY OF STEEL THE NEW PASSENGER EQUIPMENT NOW BEING BUILT FOR MANY OF OUR LARGEST RAILWAYS IS ENTIRELY OF STEEL CONSTRUCTION BRIDGES HERETOFORE BUILT ENTIRELY OF TIMBERS ARE NOW BEING MADE OF CONCRETE AND DEPOT PLATFORMS ARE BEING CONSTRUCTED OF GRAVEL OR CONCRETE THE LARGEST STREET CAR PLANT IN THE COUNTRY LOCATED IN ST LOUIS HAS RECENTLY BEGUN BUILDING STREET CARS OF STEEL CONSTRUCTION THROUGHOUT EXCEPT THE FLOORS WHICH ARE CONCRETE A LARGE BOX MANUFACTURER RECENTLY MADE THE STATEMENT THAT BOXES MADE OF WOOD PULP ARE ELIMINATING THE USE OF SIX MILLION FEET OF LUMBER EVERY YEAR IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO ALONE FIVE OR SIX YEARS AGO LARGE BUILDINGS OF THE SLOW COMBUSTION TYPE CALLED FOR FROM ONE TO FIVE MILLION FEET OF TIMBERS AND FACTORY FLOORING EACH ALL SUCH STRUCTURES ARE NOW BEING BUILT OF REIN FORCED CONCRETE TREATED PINE POLE TIES AND TIES MADE OF INFERIOR SPECIES OF VARIOUS WOODS ARE BEING USED TO SUCH AN EXTENT BY THE RAILROADS IN RECENT YEARS THAT THE USE OF SAWN PINE TIES IS DECREAS ING AT A SURPRISING RATE WHILE NOT IN FACT A SUBSTITUTE THE USE OF SUCH TREATED TIES HAS THE SAME EFFECT AS A SUBSTITUTE CONSIDERING THAT MOST OF THE INFERIOR WOODS OF WHICH THESE TIES ARE MADE HAD LITTLE OR NO COMMERCIAL VALUE UNTIL SO USED IT IS ONLY NATURAL THAT WHEN THE DEMAND FOR SUCH MATERIAL CEASES THE MILLS THAT FORMERLY CATERED TO THAT CLASS OF TRADE WILL 535 97THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY TURN THEIR ATTENTION TO THE MANUFACTURE OF YARD STOCK THE ADVENT OF THE STEEL FREIGHT CAR DISPENSES WITH THE USE OF CAR SILLS AND THE SILLS MADE HEREAFTER WILL BE USED ONLY IN REPAIRING OLD CARS THERE IS NO WAY OF ARRIVING AT THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF LUMBER THAT THESE VARIOUS SUBSTITUTES ARE REPLACING BUT IT MUST STRELY RUN INTO THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF FEET PER ANNUM I DO NOT MEAN TO CONVEY BY THIS THAT I THINK LESS LUMBER WILL BE CONSUMED HEREAFTER ON THE CONTRARY I THINK THE COUNTRY WILL USE AS MUCH AS IT EVER HAS BUT THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THE PER CAPITA CONSUMPTION ON ACCOUNT OF THESE SUBSTITUTES WILL BE LESS HOWEVER THE POINT I WISH TO MAKE IS THIS WHEN THE CUSTOMARY USES FOR A COMMERCIAL WOOD OF ANY SPECIES OR FOR LUMBER OF ANY KIND FALL OFF OR CEASE ALTOGETHER THE MANU FACTURER OF THAT KIND OF LUMBER WILL NATURALLY BE COMPELLED TO DIVERT HIS PRODUCT INTO OTHER CHANNELSANOTHER TENDENCY TO OVERPRODUC TION DURING THESE TIMES OF REVOLUTIONARY BUILDING METHODS AND WHILE THE PRODUCTION OF YARD STOCK IS THUS CONSTANTLY INCREASING IT IS GOING TO BE NECESSARY FOR US ALL TO GO A LITTLE EASY SO AS TO ALLOW THE GENERAL OUTPUT OF LUMBER TO FIT AND ADJUST ITSELF TO THE REQUIREMENTS AND DEMANDS OF THE COUNTRY AS WE NOW FIND THEM OVERPRODUCTION THE PROBLEM BUT NO MATTER WHAT THE REASONS WE FIND THAT OVERPRODUCTION EXISTS AS THE ONE CONDITION WITH WHICH WE MUST COPE IF WE EXPECT TO EVER ATTAIN PROSPERITY IN OUR BUSINESS WE CANNOT LOOK FOR A REMEDY IN THE DEMAND FOR THE REASON THAT IT WILL BE MANY YEARS UNTIL THE COUNTRY WILL HAVE GROWN TO THE POINT WHERE IT CAN CON SUME UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS THE AMOUNT OF LUMBER THAT THE MILLS IN THE SOUTH ARE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING TODAY I FIRMLY BE LIEVE THAT IF THE MANUFACTURERS WOULD OPERATE THEIR PLANTS TO THEIR FULLEST CAPACITY FOR EIGHT MONTHS THEY COULD PRODUCE AS MUCH LUMBER IN THAT TIME AS THE COUNTRY WOULD USE IN A YEAR IT IS THEREFORE CLEARLY TO THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY IF EACH AND EVERY MANUFACTURER WILL FOR HIMSELF AND IN HIS OWN WAY REDUCE HIS OUTPUT TO CONFORM TO THE DEMAND FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS THE AVERAGE PRICE OF LUMBER HAS HOVERED AROUND 1200 PER THOUSAND LET US TAKE FOR EXAMPLE A MANUFACTURER PRODUCING 20000000 FEET A YEAR AND CONSIDER HIS INTERESTS UNDER A POLICY OF CURTAILMENT SHOULD HE CONSIDER THE ADVISABILITY OF MAKING LESS LUMBER AT THE PREVAILING PRICE OF 1200 DURING THE PAST TWO 536 98THE YELLOW PINE SITUATION YEARS HE WOULD RECEIVE FOR HIS ANNUAL CUT OF 20000000 FEET 240 OOOOO LET US SAY THAT THIS MANUFACTURER DECIDES TO MAKE 30 PER CENT LESS LUMBER OR 14000000 FEET INSTEAD OF 20000000 UNDER A CURTAILMENT TO THAT EXTENT IF GENERALLY APPLIED THROUGHOUT THE LUMBER PRODUCING TERRITORY LUMBER WOULD WITHOUT DIFFICULTY BRING AN AVERAGE PRICE OF 1700 PER THOUSAND AT 1700 THEN THIS MANUFACTURER WOULD RECEIVE JUST AS MUCH MONEY FOR HIS 14000000 FEET 24000000 AS 20000000 FEET WOULD HAVE NETTED HIM AT I200 BESIDES HE HAS 6000000 FEET MORE STANDING TIMBER LEFT IN HIS FORESTS THAN HE WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE HAD COMPARISON OF COSTS AGAINST THIS SOME ONE WILL NO DOUBT ADVANCE THE ARGUMENT THAT UNDER CURTAILMENT IT COSTS MORE PER THOUSAND FEET TO PRODUCE LUMBER FOR THE REASON THAT THE FIXED CHARGES REMAIN PRACTICALLY THE SAME AS WHEN RUNNING FULL TIME THAT IS TRUE BUT LET US SEE HOW IT WORKS OUT IN THE OPERATIONS OF THE MANUFACTURE WE HAVE TAKEN AS AN ILLUSTRATION WITH AN OUTPUT OF 20000000 FEET PER ANNUM LET US SAY THAT THE COST OF LABOR IN THE PRODUCTION OF THIS LUMBER AMOUNTS TO 600 PER THOUSAND AND WE WILL GRANT THAT LABOR WILL COST HIM 7OO PER THOUSAND WHILE MAKING ONLY 14000000 FEET BUT IT MUST BE REMEMBERED HE IS MAKING 6OOOOO0 FEET LESS LUMBER WHICH AT THE COST OF 600 PER THOUSAND FOR LABOR SAVES HIM ON HIS PAY ROLLS 36OOO00 BY THE END OF THE YEAR NOW THEN SINCE THE COST OF HIS LABOR WHILE PRODUCING ONLY 14000000 FEET HAS INCREASED I00 PER THOUSAND HE LOSES ON THAT ACCOUNT I400000 ON HIS YEARS CUT BUT EVEN SO THIS LOSS BEING OFFSET BY THE 36OOO00 WHICH HE SAVED ON HIS PAY ROLLS BY REASON OF HAVING MADE 60000OO FEET LESS LUMBER STILL LEAVES HIM 2200000 AHEAD THAT IS HE HAS SAVED HIMSELF THE OUTLAY OF THAT MUCH MONEY ON LABOR BESIDES HE HAS STANDING IN HIS FORESTS THE 6O00OOO000 FEET OF TIMBER THAT HE HAS SAVED THIS AT 400 PER THOUSANDWHICH IT WOULD COST TO REPLACE ITWOULD AMOUNT TO 2400O000 THUS IT CAN BE SEEN THAT THE TOTAL SAVINGON LABOR 2200000 AND ON TIMBER 2400000WOULD BE 46O00000 ON HIS YEARS OPERATIONS BUT THE POINT IS THIS HE HAS RECEIVED JUST AS MUCH MONEY GROSS FOR THE 14000000 FEET AS 20000000 FEET WOULD HAVE BROUGHT HIM AND BESIDES HE HAS DONE A PROFITABLE BUSINESS INSTEAD OF CRAMMING EVERY LOG THROUGH THE SAWS THAT HE POS 537 99THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY SIBLY COULD HE HAS TAKEN HIS TIME AND MADE THE MOST OF HIS RAW MATERIAL USING THE LOGS IN THE TREE TOPS AND THE DEFECTIVE TIMBER WHICH AT THE PRICE OF 1200 HE COULD POSSIBLY NOT AFFORD TO BRING IN FROM THE WOODS ONE OF THE GREATEST PUBLIC CONCERNS OF THE DAY LOCAL AND NATIONAL IS THE CONSERVATION OF THE FORESTS WITH AS MANY SAW MILLS IN OPERATION AS THERE ARE THERE CAN POSSIBLY BE NO BETTER WAY OF CONSERVING THE FORESTS THAN TO USE EVERY TREE AND EVERY LOG OF MERCHANTABLE SIZE IN THEM THAT IS TO UTILIZE ALL OF THE TIMBER AND NOT WASTE ANY OF IT BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CON CEIVE HOW OUR FORESTS CAN BE CONSERVED IF THE PRODUCTION OF LUMBER IS SO GREAT AND THE MARKET AS A RESULT SO UNPROFITABLE THAT NOTHING BUT THE CHOICEST TIMBER CAN BE USED AND THE BALANCE LEFT TO WASTE 538 100

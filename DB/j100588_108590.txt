J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,108590,ON PERIODICAL LAWS DISCOVERABLE IN THE MEAN EFFECTS OF THE LARGER MAGNETIC DISTURBANCES NO III,I207011, 357  XV ON PERIODICAL LAWS DISCOVERABLE IN THE MEAN EFFECTS OF THE LARGER MAGNETIC DISTURBANCESNO III BY COLONEL EDWARD SABINE RA DCL TREAS AND VPRS RECEIVED FEBRUARY 6READ FEBRUARY 14 1856 HAVING AT LENGTH COMPLETED THE ANALYSIS OF THE LARGER DISTURBANCES OF THE HORI ZONTAL AND VERTICAL MAGNETIC FORCES AT TORONTO DURING FIVE YEARS OF HOURLY OBSERVA TION WITH A VIEW TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PERIODICAL LAWS WHICH REGULATE THE OCCUR RENCE OF THE OCCASIONAL DISTURBANCES OF THOSE ELEMENTS AND OF THEIR THEORETICAL EQUIVA LENTS THE INCLINATION AND TOTAL FORCE I NOW PROPOSE TO LAY BEFORE THE ROYAL SOCIETY A CONDENSED VIEW OF THE MODE IN WHICH THE INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN MADE AND OF ITS RESULTS THE HOURLY OBSERVATIONS OF THE BIFILAR AND VERTICAL FORCE MAGNETOMETERS DURING THE FIVE YEARS TERMINATING JUNE 30 1848 WERE RECEIVED AT WOOLWICH FROM TORONTO PRECISELY IN THE STATE IN WHICH THEY ARE PRINTED IN THE SECOND AND THIRD VOLUMES OF THE  OBSERVATIONS AT THE TORONTO OBSERVATORY NAMELY THE READINGS UNCORRECTED FOR TEMPERATURE AT EVERY HOUR OF GOTTINGEN TIME ARRANGED IN MONTHLY TABLES ACCOM PANIED BY CORRESPONDING TABLES OF THE TEMPERATURE OF THE MAGNETS SHOWN BY THERMO METERS OF WHICH THE BALLS WERE ENCLOSED IN THE SAME CASE WITH THE MAGNETS AND WHICH WERE READ CONTEMPORANEOUSLY WITH THE BIFILAR AND VERTICAL FORCE SCALES THE MONTHLY TABLES OF THE SCALEREADINGS AND OF THE TEMPERATURES WERE SUMMED BEFORE THEIR TRANSMISSION TO WOOLWICH BOTH IN VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL COLUMNS AND MEANS WERE TAKEN OF ALL THE DAYS IN THE MONTH AT THE DIFFERENT HOURS AND OF ALL THE HOURS OF THE DAY ON THE DIFFERENT DAYS FORMING  HOURLY MEANS AND  DAILY MEANS IN THIS STATE THE OBSERVATIONS WERE RECEIVED AT WOOLWICH AND SUBSEQUENTLY PRINTED THEY WERE IN FACT PRINTED FROM THE ORIGINAL MANUSCRIPTS THE FIRST STEP TAKEN AT THE OFFICE AT WOOLWICHL WAS TO REWRITE THE WHOLE OF THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE FIVE YEARS IN SCALEDIVISIONS CORRESPONDING TO THE RESPECTIVE READINGS BUT REDUCED TO A UNIFORM TEMPERATURE OF 55 WHICH WAS TAKEN AS A CONVE NIENT APPROXIMATE MEAN TEMPERATURE FOR THIS PURPOSE EACH OF THE OBSERVATIONS HAD TO RECEIVE A CORRECTION PROPORTIONED TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RECORDED CONTEMPO RANEOUS READING OF THE THERMOMETER AND THE STANDARD TEMPERATURE OF 55 AND COM PUTED BY A COEFFICIENT REPRESENTING THE CHANGE IN THE SCALEREADING PRODUCED BY AN ALTERATION OF 1 OF THE THERMOMETER THE COEFFICIENT WAS OBTAINED DIRECTLY FROM THE OBSERVATIONS THEMSELVES BY ASCERTAINING THE FACTOR WHICH WOULD BEST SATISFY THE DIFFER MDCCCLVI 3 BCOLONEL SABINE ON PERIODICAL LAWS DISCOVERABLE ENCES OF THE SCALEREADINGS IN DIFFERENT NATURAL TEMPERATURES WHEN THE MAGNETOMETERS WERE MOUNTED AND IN USE THE FORMATION OF THE MONTHLY TABLES OF THE  SCALEREADINGS REDUCED TO A UNIFORM TEMPERATURE OF 55 FROM THE TABLES  UNCORRECTED FOR TEMPERATURE WAS PEIFORMED BY TWO NONCOMMNISSIONED OFFICERS OF THE ROYAL ARTILLERY WORKING INDEPENDENTLY OF EACH OTHER THE CORRECTNESS OF THEIR WORK WAS PROVED BY THE ACCORDANCE OF THE TWO INDEPENDENT COMPUTERS THE DAILY AND HOURLY MEANS WERE THEN TAKEN IN THE SAME MANNER BY TWO INDEPENDENT COMPUTERS AND WERE ADDITIONALLY CHECKED BY THEIR COM PARISONS WITH THE DAILY AND HOURLY UNCORRECTED MEANS CALCULATED AT TORONTO THESE MEANS BEING ALSO REDUCED FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS COMPARISON TO THE STANDARD TEMPERA TURE OF 55 EXCEPTING IN A VERY FEW INSTANCES IN WHICH THE OBSERVATIONS ON DAYS OF EXCESSIVE DISTURBANCE HAD BEEN OMITTED IN THE SUMS AND MEANS OF THE UNCORRECTED READINGS COMPUTED AT TORONTO BUT WERE RESTORED IN THE SUMS AND MEANS OF THE COR RECTED TABLES THE NEW TABLES THUS FORMED OF THE SCALEREADINGS REDUCED TO 55 THEN PASSED INTO MY HANDS WHEN I SATISFIED MYSELF BY A CAREFUL EXAMINATION THAT A DIFFERENCE OF FOURTEEN SCALEDIVISIONS FOR THE BIFILAR MAGNETOMETER AND OF FOUR SCALEDIVISIONS FOR THE VERTICAL FORCE MAGNETOMETER ABOVE OR BELOW WHAT MIGHT BE TAKEN AS A NORMAL VALUEVIZ THE MEAN VALUE AT THE SAME HOUR DURING THE SAME MONTH OR FOR SEVERAL PRECEDING AND SEVERAL SUCCEEDING DAYSWOULD CONSTITUTE A CON VENIENT MINIMUM LITMIT FOR THE DISTURBANCES OF LARGEST AMOUNT SINCE ON THE ONE HAND IT WOULD BE A GREATER DEPARTURE FROM THE NORMAL VALUE THAN COULD REASONABLY BE ASCRIBED TO ANY OTHER CAUSE THAN THAT OF A DISTURBANCE IN THE EARTHS MAGNETISM WHILST ON THE OTHER HAND THE NUMBER OF DISTURBANCES THAT WOULD BE THEREBY SEPARATED WOULD FOIRM A SUFFICIENT BODY TO PERMIT THEIR PERIODICAL LAWS IF SUCH EXISTED TO BE INVESTI GATED HAVING DETERMINED ON THIS LIMIT I PROCEEDED TO MARK PROVISIONALLY WITH A PENCIL EVERY OBSERVATION WHICH DIFFERED IN THE BIFILAR FOURTEEN SCALEDIVISIONS OR MORE AND IN THEVERTICAL FORCE MAGNETOMETER FOUR SCALEDIVISIONS OR MORE FIROM THEIR RESPECT IVE NORMALS I THEN RECOMPUTED THE NORMALS OMITTING THE OBSERVATIONS PROVISIONALLY MARKED AS DISTURBED AND COMPARED AFRESH ALL THE OBSERVATIONS INCLUDING THE PROVI SIONALLYMARKED ONES WITH THE NEW NORMALS ALTERING THE MARKINGS WHERE REQUIRED AND I CONTINUED THIS PROCESS UNTIL THE NORMAL IN EVERY CASE INCLUDED EVERY OBSERVATION WHICH DIFFERED IN THE BIFILAR LESS THAN FOURTEEN AND IN THE VERTICAL FORCE MAGNETO METER LESS THAN FOUR SCALEDIVISIONS FROM ITSELF AND EXCLUDED EVERY OBSERVATION WHICH DIFFERED IN THE BIFILAR FOURTEEN AND IN THE VERTICAL FORCE MAGNETOMETER FOUR SCALE DIVISIONS OR MORE FROM ITSELF THE EXCLUDED OBSERVATIONS WERE THEN MARKED FINALLY WITH A SURROUNDING RING IN INK IN THIS STATE THE TABLES WERE RETURNED TO THE OFFICE AND THE CORRECTNESS OF THE MARKINGS AND OF THE NORMALS EXCLUDING THE LARGER DISTURB ANCES WAS EXAMINED BY A SEPARATE COMPUTER TWO COMPUTERS WORKING SEPARATELY AND HAVING THEIR WORK COMPARED THEN FORMED A TABLE OF THE IMARKED DISTURBANCES OF EACH ELEMENT DURING THE FIVE YEARS ARRANGED 358IN THE MEAN EFFECTS OF THE LARGER MAGNETIC DISTURBANCES 359 CHRONOLOGICALLY SHOWING THE DAY THE HOUR AND THE AMOUNT OF DISTURBANCE I E THE DIFFERENCE FROM THE NORMAL IN SCALEDIVISIONS AND ON THE RECEIPT OF THIS TABLE FROM THE OFICE I PROCEEDED TO DISTRIBUTE THE DISTURBANCES ACCORDING TO THE YEARS MONTHS AND HOURS OF THEIR OCCURRENCE SEPARATING THLEM INTO DISTURBANCES INCREASING AND DISTURBANCES DECREASING THE RESPECTIVE FORCES AND FORMING ANNUAL MONTHLY AND HOURLY TABLES THE CORRECTNESS OF THE DISTRIBUTION AND OF THE CALCULATIONS IN EACH OF THE TABLES BEING IN EVERY CASE EXAMINED BY A SECOND PERSON IN COURSE OF THE PROCESS OF MALKING THE DISTURBANCES IT BECAME EVIDENT THAT THERE WERE TIMES OCCASIONAL BUT BY NO MEANS FRAEQUENT WHEN THE CHANGE IN THE MEAN NMONTHLY SCALEREADING I E THE MEAN OF ALL THE HOURS AND ALL THE DAYS IN THE MONTH FROM ONNE MONTH TO THE NEXT WAS SO CONSIDEABLE AS TO CAUSE THE REGULAR HOURLY NORMNALS OF THE MONTH TO BE INAPPLICABLE TO ITS EARLIER OR LATER PORTIONS IN SUCH CASES THE DIFFICULTY WAS MET AND MORE SUITABLE NORMALS OBTAINED FOR THE EARLIER OR LATER PORTIONS OF THE RNONTH BY TAKING THE HOURLY MEANS OF THE LAST FORTNIGHT OF THE ONE MONTH AND THE FIRST FORTNIGHTA OF THEEXT OR A MEAN OF THE NORMALS OF THE TWO MONTHS COMBINED OR IN A VERY FEW INSTANCES IN WHICH THE DEPARTURE FROM AN UNIFORMLY PROGRESSIVE CHANGE WAS GREATEST BY NORMALS DERIVED FROM PERIODS OF LESS DURATION THAN A MONTH THE TABLES SHOWING THE NORMAL VALUES FINALLY ADOPTED THE PERIODS FOR WHICH THEY WERE EMPLOYED AND THE PERIODS FROM WHICH THEY WERE DERIVED TOGETHER WITH THE ANNUAL MONTHLY AND HOURLY TABLES OF THE AGGREGATE VALUES OF THE LARGER DISTURBANCES OF THE HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL FORCES IN THE SEVERAL YEARS MONTHS AND HOURS WILL BE FOUND IN FULL DETAIL IN THE THIRD VOLUME OF THE TORONTO OBSERVATIONS WHICH IS NOW IN THE PRESS THE DISTURBANCES OF THE INCLINATION WHICH EQUALLED OR EXCEEDED 1H0 AND OF THE TOTAL FORCE WHICH EQUALLED OR EXCEEDED 0004 OF THE WHOLE FORCE BOTH MEASURED FRIOM THE RESPECTIVE NORMALS AT THE SAME HOUR AND IN THE SAME MONTH WERE OBTAINED FROM THE OBSERVED DISTURBANCES OF THE HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL FORCES IN THE FOLLOWING MANNERTABLES WERE FORMED IN THE FIRST COLUMN OF WHICH WERE PLACED IN CHRONO LOGICAL ORLDER THE LARGER DISTURBANCES OF THE VERTICAL FORCE SEPARATED AS ALREADY DESCRIBED AND IN THE SECOND COLUMN THOSE OF THE HORIZONTAL FORCE EACH EXPRESSED IN TERMS OF THE RESPECTIVE FORCES BY THE CONVERSION OF THE SCALEDIVISIONS IN WHICH THE DISTURBANCES WERE OBSERVED INTO PARTS OF THE RESPECTIVE FORCES BY MEANS OF THE SCALE COEFFICIENT AT A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE HOURS OF CONTEMPORANEOUS OBSERVATION WHEN ONE OF THE TWO COMPONENTS OF THE FORCE EXHIBITED A DISTURBANCE WHICH BY ITS AMOUNT WAS BROUGHT INTO THE CATEGORY OF THE LARGER DISTURBANCES THE OTHER COMPO NENT WAS ALSO DISTURBED IN SUCH CASES THERE WERE CONTEMPORANEOUS ENTRIES IN BOTH COLUMNS BUT WHEN ONE OF THE COMPONENTS ONLY WAS SO AFFECTED THE ENTRY IN THE CORRESPONDING COLUMN OF THE OTHER COMPONENT WAS BLANK THESE BLANKS WERE NOW ALL FILLED UP BY INSERTING FOR THE COMPONENT WHICH DID NOT EXHIBIT A DISTURBANCE OF SUFFICIENTLY LARGE AMOUNT TO HAVE BEEN CLASSED AS A LARGE DISTURBANCE AND SEPARATED 3B2COLONEL SABINE ON PERIODICAL LAWS DISCOVERABLE ACCORDINGLY THE DIFFERENCE WHATEVER THAT MIGHT BE BETWEEN THE

THESE DISTURBANCES WERE THEN DEALT WITH IN REGARD TO CLASSIFICATION AND TABULAR ARRANGEMENT IN THE SAME MANNER AS THAT WHICH HAS BEEN ALREADY EXPLAINED IN TREATING OF DISTURBANCES OF THE HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL COMPO NENTS OF THE FORCE IN DERIVING THE DISTURBANCES OF THE INCLINATION AND LOTAL FORCE FROM THOSE OF THE HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL FORCES ALL THE CALCULATIONS AND ARRANGEMENTS IN TABLES WERE PREPARED UNDER THE SUPERINTENDENCE OF MR MAGRATH CHIEF CLERK BY THE NONCOM MISSIONEDOFFICERS OF THE ROYAL ARTILLERY EMPLOYED IN THE WOOLWICH OFFICE EVERY PART OF THE PROCESS HAVING HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF TWO INDEPENDENT COMPUTERS TO COMPLETE THE VIEW OF THE PERIODICAL LAWS OF THE MAGNETIC DISTURBANCES AT TORONTO A REVISION HAS BEEN MADE OF THE ANALYSIS OF THE LARGER DISTURBANCES OF THE DECLINATION THE RESULTS OF WHICH WERE CONTAINED IN A FORMER PAPER PRESENTED TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY IN 1852 THESE DISTURBANCES HAVE NOW BEEN COMPUTED FROM NORMALS ON 360IN THE MEAN EFFECTS OF THE LARGER MAGNETIC DISTURBANCES 361 WHICH THE SAME LABOUR HAS BEEN BESTOWED AS ON THOSE OF THE HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL FORCES SO AS TO CAUSE THEM TO INCLUDE ALL THE OBSERVATIONS WHICH DIFFER LESS AND EXCLUDE ALL THOSE WHICH DIFFER MORE THAN A CERTAIN FIXED VALUE FROM THEMSELVES IN THIS REVI SION ALSO THE FIXED OR STANDARD MEASURE OF A LARGE DISTURBANCE HAS BEEN INCREASED FROM FIVE SCALEDIVISIONS 3H6 OF ARC TO SEVEN SCALEDIVISIONS OR 50 OF ARC THE EXPERI ENCE GAINED IN THE FIRST OR EXPERIMENTAL EXAMINATION HAVING LED TO THTE BELIEF THAT THE HIGHER STANDARD IS ON THE WHOLE TO BE PREFERRED GENERAL CONCLUSIONS DECENNIAL PERIODIN A COMMUNICATION MADE TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY ON THE 18TH OF MARCH 1852 IT WAS SHOWN THAT THE LARGER DISTURBANCES OF THE DECLINATION BOTLI AT TORONTO AND AT HOBARTON INDICATED BY THE VARIATION IN THEIR NUMBERS AND AGGRE GATE VALUES IN DIFFERENT YEARS THE EXISTENCE OF A PERIODICAL INEQUALITY OF WHICH THE EXTREME AND OPPOSITE PHASES WERE FIVE YEARS DISTANT FROM EACH OTHER AND THE YEARS 1843 AND 1848 WERE RESPECTIVELY THE EPOCHS OF MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM THE EXAMINATION WHICH LED TO THIS CONCLUSION COMPREHENDED THE YEARS FROM 1841 TO 1848 INCLUSIVE AND WAS DEFINITE IN RESPECT TO 1843 AS THE YEAR OF MINIMUM INASMUCH AS 1841 1842 AND 1843 SHOWED A PROGRESSIVE DECREASE IN THE NUMBER AND AGGREGATE VALUE OF THE LARGER DISTURBANCES IN EACH YEAR WHILST FIOM 1843 TO 1848 THERE WAS A PROGRESSIVE INCREASE OF BOTH IN SUCCESSIVE YEARS IT WAS NOTICED IN THE SAME COM MUNICATION THAT THE REGULAR DIURNAL VARIATION OF EACH OF THE THREE MAGNETIC OBSER VATIONELEMENTS AT TORONTO AND HOBARTON THE DECLINATION THE HORIZONTAL FORCE AND THEVERTICALFORCE AND OF EACH OF THE TWO DERIVED ELEMENTS THE INCLINATION AND THETOTAL FORCE EXHIBITED EVIDENCES OF A CORRESPONDING PERIODICAL INEQUALITY IN THE AMPLITUDE OR EXTENT OF THE DIURNAL VARIATION THE YEARS 1843 AND 1848 BEING ALSO EPOCHS RE SPECTIVELY OF MINIMURN AND MAXIMTUM THE OBSERVATIONS OF ONE OF THE ELEMENTS THE DECLINATION EXTENDING UNINTERRUPTEDLY AT BOTH STATIONS OVER ELEVEN ENTIRE YEARS OR FROM 1841 TO 1851 INCLUSIVE DISTINCTLY POINTED OUT 1848 AS THE YEAR OF MAXIMURN AS WELL AS 1843 AS THE YEAR OF MINIMUM THIS DISCOVERY OF THE EXISTENCE OF A PERIODICAL INEQUALITY COMMON TO THE MAGNETIC DISTURBANCES OF LARGER AMOUNT AND TO THOSE MORE REGULAR DIURNAL MAGNETIC VARIATIONS OF WHICH THE SUN HAS BEEN LONG RECOGNIZED AS THE PRIMARY CAUSE INASMNUCH AS THEY CONFORM SYSTEMATICALLY TO LAWS DEPENDING ON SOLAR TIME WAS REGARDED AS AFFORDING PRESUMPTIVE EVIDENCE OF THE SUBSISTENCE OF A CAUSAL CONNEXION COMMON TO THOSE TWO CLASSES OF PHENOMENA WHICH PRESUMPTION WAS CORROBORATED BY FACTS ADDUCED IN THE SAME COMMUNICATION PROVING THAT THE DISTURBANCES ARE THEMSELVES SUBJECT ON THE AVERAGE TO A WELLMARKED DIURNAL PERIOD WHICH IS ALSO REGULATED BY SOLAR TIME THE PERIODICAL INEQUALITY THUS MANIFESTED HAVING ITS OPPOSITE PHASES OF MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM SEPARATED BY AN INTERVAL OF FIVE YEARS AND OF WHICH THE CYCLE MIGHT THEREFORE BE CONCEIVED TO INCLUDE ABOUT TEN OF OUR SOLAR YEARS DID NOT APPEAR TO CONNECT ITSELF WITH ANY OF THOSE DIVISIONS OF TIME WITH WHICH WE ARE CONVERSANT ASCOLONEL SABINE ON PERIODICAL LAWS DISCOVERABLE DEPENDING UPON THE RELATIVE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE SUN AND THE EARTH AND HER SATEL LITE THE CYCLE NIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE ONE OF REGULAR AND UNFAILING RECURRENCE THE OBSERVATIONAL EVIDENCE TO WHICH WE ARE INDEBTED FOR A KNOWLEDGE OF ITS EXIST ENCE THOUGH SUFFICIENTLY DECISIVE AS FAR AS THE PERIOD OF OBSERVATION EXTENDED COULD ONLY BE VIEWED IN REFERENCE TO A PERMANENTLY CYCLICAL CHARACTER OF THE PHENOMENON AS FRAGMENTARY AND AS THE COMMENCEMENT OF AN INVESTIGATION WHICH WOULD REQUIRE TO BE PURSUED IN ONE OR MORE OF THE PERMANENT MAGNETIC OBSERVATORIES ESTABLISHED IN OUR OWN AND OTHER COUNTRIES HAD NO OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE PRESENTED ITSELF TO GIVE AN ADDITIONAL INTEREST TO AN INVESTIGATION WHICH THUS HELD OUT A FAIR PROMISE AT LEAST OF MAKING KNOWN LAWS OF DEFINITE ORDER AND SEQUENCE IN PHENOMENA WHICH HAVE EXCITED SO MUCH ATTENTION OF LATE YEARS BUT OF WHICH SO LITTLE IS EVEN YET KNOWN HAD FOR EXAMPLE THE DECENNIAL PERIOD WHICH APPEARED TO PREVAIL WITH PRECISELY CORRESPONDING FEATURES IN TWO DISTINCT CLASSES OF THE MAGNETIC VARIATIONS CONNECTED ITSELF WITH NO OTHER PERIODICAL VARIATION EITHER OF A TERRESTRIAL OR COSMICAL NATURE WITH WHICH WE ARE ACQUAINTEDTHERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN INDEED LITTLE REASON TO APPREHEND THAT THE INVES TIGATION WOULD HAVE BEEN SUFFERED TO DROP BUT THE INTEREST AND IMPORTANCE OF THE INQUIRY HAVE DOUBTLESS BEEN GREATLY ENHANCED BY THE REMARKABLE COINCIDENCE WHICH IT WAS THE OBJECT OF THE PAPER COMMUNICATED TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY IN MARCH 1852 TO ANNOUNCE BETWEEN THLE ABOVEDESCRIBED PERIODICAL INEQUALITY BY WHICH THE MAGNETIC VARIATIONS REFERABLE TO SOLAR INFLUENCE ARE AFFECTED AND THE PERIODICAL INEQUALITY WHICH HAS BEEN DISCOVERED BY M SCHWABE TO EXIST IN THE FREQUENCY AND MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SPOTS THE COINCIDENCE AS FAR AS WE ARE YET ABLE TO DISCOVER IS ABSOLUTE THE DURATION OF THE PERIOD IS THE SAME AND THE EPOCHS OF MAXIMUM AND MINIMUML FALL IN BOTLI CASES IN THE SAME YEARS THE REGULARITY WITH WHICH THE ALTERNATIONS OF INCREASE AND DECREASE HAVE BEEN TRACED BY M SCHWABE IN HIS OBSERVATIONS OF THE SOLAR SPOTS WHICH HAVE BEEN NOW CONTINUED FOR ABOUT THIRTY YEARS MUST BE REGARDED AS CONFERRING A VERY HIGH DEGREE OF PROBABILITY ON THE SYSTEMATIC CHARACTER OF CAUSES WHICH ARE AS YET KNOWN TO US ONLY BY THE VISIBLE APPEARANCES WHICH THEY PRODUCE ON THE SUNS DISK AND BY THE DISTURBANCES WHICH THEY OCCASION IN THE MAGNETIC DIRECTION AND FORCE AT THE SURFACE OF OUR GLOBE AS A DISCOVERY WHICH PROMISES TO RAISE TERRESTRIAL MAG NETISM TO THE DIGNITY OF A COSMICAL SCIENCE WE MAY FEEL CONFIDENT THAT ALTHOUGH THE COLONIAL OBSERVATORIES HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO A CLOSE THE INVESTIGATIONS WHICH THEY HAVE THUS SUCCESSFULLY COMMENCED WILL BE PURSUED TO THEIR PROPER ACCOMPLISHMENT IN THOSE NATIONAL ESTABLISHMENTS WHICH HAVE A PERMANENCY SUITABLE FOR SUCH UNDER TAKINGS THE CONCLUSIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN DRAWN BOTH IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS AND IN THE INTRODUCTORY DISCUSSIONS IN THE TORONTO AND HOBARTON VOLUMES REGARDING THE PERIODICAL LAWS OF THE DISTURBANCES AT THOSE STATIONS HAVE BEEN HITHERTO CONFINED EXCLUSIVELY TO THE DISTURBANCES OF A SINGLE ELEMTENT THE DECLINATION IT WAS FULLY RECOGNIZED THAT EACH OF THE OTHER TWO OBSERVATIONAL ELEMENTS VIZ THE HORIZONTAL AND HE VERTICAL FORCES MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO FURNISH CONCURRENT BUT STRICTLY INDEPENDENT 362IN THE MEAN EFFECTS OF THE LARGER MAGNETIC DISTURBANCES 363 EVIDENCE OF THE PERIODICAL AFFECTIONS TO WHICH THE MAGNETIC DISTURBANCES WERE SUBJECT BUT THE WORK TO BE ACCOMPLISHED FOR THE ELABORATION OF THAT EVIDENCE WAS CONSIDER ABLY GREATER THAN IN THE CASE OF THE DECLINATION FIOM THE NECESSITY OF ELIMINATING THE INFLUENCE OF CHANGES OF TEMPERATURE ON THE MAGNETS EMPLOYED IN MEASURING THE VARI ATIONS OF THE HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL FORCES BEFORE THOSE DISTURBANCES COULD BE SEPA RATED FOR ANALYSIS THE LABOUR REQUIRED IN THE DIFFERENT PROCESSES OF REDUCTION HAS NOW BEEN GONE THROUGH AND IT RETNAINS TO BRING TOGETHER IN ONE VIEW THE EVIDENCE WHICH THE THREE OBSERVATIONAL AND THE TWO DERIVED ELEMENTS FURNISH OF THE PERIODICAL LAWS DECENNIAL ANNUAL AND DIURNAL WHICH REGULATE THE OCCURRENCE OF THE LARGER DISTURBANCES IN RESPECT TO THE DECENNIAL PERIOD IT MUST BE REGARDED AS A FORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THE FIVE YEARS OF HOURLY OBSERVATION WHICH WERE COMMENCED BEFORE THE EXIST ENCE OF ANY INEQUALITY OF LONGER DURATION THAN A YEAR WAS SUSPECTED BEGAN WITH 1843 THE YEAR OF MINIMUM AND CLOSED WITH 1848 THE YEAR OF MAXIMUM DISTURBANCE SO THAT THE VARIATION HAS BEEN FOLLOWED THROUGH A COMPLETE PHASE THIS HAS BEEN STRICTLY THE CASE IN THE DECLINATION AND HORIZONTAL FORCES AND WITH A SINGLE EXCEP TION IN THE VERTICAL FORCE ALSO THE EXCEPTION BEING CAUSED BY THE INTERRUPTION OF THE OBSERVATIONS OF THAT ELEMENT FOR PURPOSES EXPLAINED ELSEWHERE DURING THE MONTHS OF OCTOBER NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER 1843 AND JANUARY AND FEBRUARY 1844 THESE MONTHS HAVE BEEN SUPPLIED IN THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 1844 FROM HOURLY OBSERVATIONS MADE WITH THE SAME APPARATUS IN THE PRECEDING YEAR VIZ IN THE MONTHS OF OCTOBER NOVELNBER AND DECEMBER 1842 AND JANUARY AND FEBRUARY 1843 THUS RENDERING THE FIVE YEARS OF THE VERTICAL FORCE COMPLETE FOR THE INVESTIGATION OF THE ANNUAL AND DIURNAL VARIATIONS BUT OF COURSE IN REGARD TO THE DECENNIAL PERIOD THE MONTHS TAKEN FIORN A DIFFERENT YEAR EVEN THOUGH IT BE THE ADJACENT ONE ARE NOT A PERFECT SUBSTITUTE THE EFFECT OF THIS SUBSTITUTION HAS BEEN IN FACT TO SWELL THE AGGREGATE VALUE OF THE DISTURBANCES OF THE VERTICAL FORCE IN THE YEAR NOMINALLY ENDING JUNE 30 1844 BUT REALLY COMPRISING FIVE MONTHS TAKEN FROM A PRECEDING YEAR SO AS TO MAKE THEM SLIGHTLY EXCEED THE AGGREGATE VALUE IN THE YEAR ENDING JTUNE 30 1845 A SIMILAR SLIGHT EXCESS IN THE AGGREGATE VALUE OF THE DISTURBANCES OF THE HORIZONTAL FORCE IN THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 1844 OVER THE AGGREGATE VALUE IN THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 1845 IS FOUND WHEN THE SAME FIVE MONTHS OF THE PRECEDING YEAR ARE SUBSTITUTED FOR ITS OWN MONTHS BUT WHEN IN THE CASE OF THE HORIZONTAL FORCE THE OBSERVATIONS OF WHICH WERE NOT SUSPENDED AS WERE THOSE OF THE VERTICAL FORCE THE ACTUAL OBSERVATIONS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 1844 ARE TAKEN THE TRUE PROGRESSION IS RESTORED AND THE APPARENT ANOMALY DISAPPEARS THE VARIATIONS OF THE THIREE MAGNETIC ELEMENTS BEING MEASURED BY INSTRUMENTS WHOLLY

INDICATIONS PRE SENT THEMSELVES OF AN ANNUAL VARIATION OF A DIFFERENT KIND FROM THAT WHICH HAS BEEN HITHERTO DISCUSSED NAMELY AN ANNUAL VARIATION IN THE CHARACTER OF THE DISTURBANCES OF TWO AT LEAST OF THE ELEMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN OBSERVED  AND ALTHOUGH A GRLEATER LENGTH OF TIME AND A GREATER AMOUNT OR CONTINUANCE OF OBSERVATION MAY BE REQUITRED FOR THE SATISFACTORY ESTABLISHMENT OF SUCH A PERIODICAL VARIATION ITS PRESENT INDICATION OUGHT NOT TO BE OVERLOOKED SINCE THLE RANGE OF THE VARIATION IS OF CONSIDERABLE MAGNI TUDE AND ITS SYSTEMATIC CHARACTER AS DISTINCTLY MARKED AS COULD WELL BE EXPECTED IN AN ANNUAL VARIATION DERIVED FROM NOT MORE THAN FIVE YEARS THE ELEMENTS IN WHICH THESE PHENOMENA ARE MOST DISTINCTLY NOTICEABLE ARE THE DECLINATION AND THE VERTICAL FORCE AND THE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE INDICATIONS OF THESE TWO ELEMENTS IS IN MANY RESPECTS VERY REMARKABLE IN BOTH ELEMENTS WHEN THE RELATIVE PROPORTIONS ARE TAKENIN THE DECLINATION OF THE AGGREGATE VALUES IN THE DIFFERENT MONTHS OF EASTERLY AND WESTERLY DISTURBANCES AND IN THE VERTICAL FORCE OF DISTURBANCES WHICH DECREASE AND DISTURBANCES WHICH INCREASE THE FORCEWE FIND THAT IN BOTH CASES THE PROPORTIONS VARY FROM A MINIMUM AT THE SOUTHERN SOLSTICE TO A MAXIMUM AT THE NORTHERN SOLSTICE THE EQUINOXES BEING INTERMEDIATE AT THE NORTHERN SOLSTICE EASTERLY DISTURBANCES ARE IN CONSIDERABLE EXCESS AS ARE DISTURBANCES WHICH DECREASE THE VERTICAL FORCE AT THE SOUTHERN SOLSTICE THE EXCESS OF BOTH IS ON THE OTHER SIDE WESTERLY DISTURBANCES THEN PREDOMINATE AS DO THE DISTURBANCES WHICH INCREASE THE VERTICAL FORCE THE RELATIVE PROPORLTION OF THE AGGREGATE VALUES OF EASTERLY TO WESTERLY DISTURBANCES OF THE DECLINATION AND OF DISTURBANCES WHICH DECREASE THE VERTICAL FORCE TO THOSE WHICH INCREASE IT VARIES FROM THE ONE SOLSTICE TO THE OTHER ROUGHLY AS ABOUT 3 TO 1 AND IN BOTH ELEMENTS NEARLY ALIKE IN THE HORIZONTAL FORCE THE DISPROPORTION BETWEEN THE VALUES OF THE DISTURBANCES WHICH INCREASE THE FORCE AND THOSE WHICH DECREASE IT IS SO GREAT DECREASING DISTURB ANCES GREATLY PREPONDERATING AT ALL PERIODS OF THE YEAR THAT A VARIATION CORRESPOND ING TO THAT OF THE TWO OTHER ELEMENTS IS NOT SO SIMPLY ARRIVED AT BUT IT MAY BE STATED GENERALLY THAT THE PROPORTION OF DECREASING DISTURBANCES IS GREATER AT THE EPOCH OF THE SOUTHERN SOLSTICE THAN AT THAT OF THE NORTHERN SOLSTICE DIURNAL

SYSTEMATIC INCREASE AND DECREASE OF THE RATIOS AT THE DIFFERENT HOURS IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE DISTURBANCES OF EACH ELEMENT WHEN VIEWED ON THE AVERAGE OF A SUFFICIENT BODY OF OBSERVATIONS ARE REGULATED BY LAWS WHICH HAVE A DIURNAL PERIOD THE DIURNAL VARIATION THUS PRESENTED IS FAR HOWEVER FROM BEING ALIKE IN EACH OF THE THREE ELEMENTS THE MAXIMUM DISTURBANCE TAKES PLACE INDEED IN ALL THE ELEMENTS DURING THE HOURS OF THE NIGHT AND THE MINIMUM DISTURBANCE DURING THE HOURS OF THE DAY BUT THE PARTICULAR HOURS OF MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM ARE VERY DIFFERENT IN THE THREE CASES THE HOUR OF MAXIMUM IN THE DECLINATION FOR EXAMPLE IS 9 PM WHEN THE DISTURBANCES OF THE HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL FORCES ARE BOTH EVEN LESS THAN THE HOURLY AVERAGE AND THLE HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL FORCES DO NOT REACH THEIR HOURS OF MAXIMUM UNTIL RESPECTIVELY 2 AND 3 AM WHEN THE DISTURBANCES OF THE DECLINATION HAVE NOTABLY DECLINED SO IN RESPECT TO THE HOUR OF MINIMUM THAT OF THE DECLINA TION 1 PM IS NEARLY MIDWAY BETWEEN THAT OF THE VERTICAL FORCE AT 11 AM AND THAT OF THE HORIZONTAL FORCE AT 4 PM THE DISTURBANCE OF THE HORIZONTAL FORCE BEING STILL HIGH WHEN THAT OF THE VERTICAL FORCE IS AT A MINIMUM AND THE DISTURBANCE OF THE VER TICAL FORCE BEING STILL HIGH WHEN THAT OF THE HORIZONTAL FORCE IS A MINIMUM SPEAKING GENERALLY THE DISTURBANCES OF THE THREE ELEMENTS ARE ABOVE THE AVERAGE IN THE HOURS OF THE NIGHT AND EARLY MORNING AND BELOW THE AVERAGE DURING THE HOURS OF THE DAY TO THE LATTER HOWEVER THERE IS AN EXCEPTION IN THE VERTICAL FORCE WHICH IS ABOVE THE AVERAGE FROM 4 TO 7 PM IN THE DECLINATION THE AGGREGATE VALUE OF THE DISTURBANCES AT THE HOUR OF MAXIMUM IS ABOUT SIX TIMES AS GREAT AS AT THE HOUR OF MINIMUM IN 3 C 2368 COLONEL SABINE ON PERIODICAL LAWS DISCOVERABLE THE HORIZONTAL FORCE ABOUT 27 AS GREAT AND IN THE VERTICAL FORCE ABOUT FIVE TIMES AS GREAT BUT IN THE RATIOS OF THE DECLINATIONDISTURBANCES AT THE DIFFERENT HOURS SHOWN IN THE PRECEDING TABLE WE HAVE THE JOINT EFFECTS OF TWO CLASSES OF DISTURBANCES THOSE WHICH PRODUCE EASTERLY AND THOSE WHICH PRODUCE WESTERLY DEFLECTIONS AND IN THE RATIOS OF THE DISTURBANCES OF THE HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL FORCES AT THE DIFFERENT HOURS WE HAVE THE FURTHER COMPLICATION THAT THE VARIATIONS OF THE HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL FORCES DO NOT BEAR A SIMPLE RELATION TO THOSE OF THEIR THEORETICAL EQUIVALENTS TO WHICH THEY ARE DUE VIZ THE INCLINATION AND TOTAL FORCE BUT INVOLVE QUANTITIES DEPENDENT ON THE RESOLUTION OF FORCES WHICH WHEN THE INCLINATION IS GREAT AS IT IS AT TORONTO HAVE A TENDENCY TO MASK THE SIMPLICITY OF TLE VARIATIONS OF THE INCLINATION AND OF THE TOTAL FORCE AS THEY WOULD APPEAR IF THEY WERE THE SUBJECTS OF DIRECT OBSERVATION IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE THEREFORE ARE PLACED THE PROPORTIONS AT THE DIFFERENT HOURS IN WHICH THE

ARE NOT ON THE ONE HAND SIMILAR NOR ON THE OTHER HANDIN THE MEAN EFFECTS OF THE LARGER MAGNETIC DISTURBANCES 369 ARE THEY ALWAYS COMPLEMENTARY TO EACH OTHER THUS FROM 1 PM TO 5 PM BOTH CLASSES OF THE DECLINATIONDISTURBANCES ARE CONSIDERABLY BELOW THE AVERAGE AND FROM 1 AM TO 5 AM BOTH CLASSES WITH A SLIGHT EXCEPTION ARE ABOVE THE AVERAGE WHILST FROM 6 PM TO 11 PM EASTERLY DISTURBANCES GREATLY EXCEED AND WESTERLY FALL GREATLY SHORT OF THE AVERAGE AND FIOM 6 AM TO 11 AM WESTERLY EXCEED AND EASTERLY FALL SHORT OF THE AVERAGE IN THE INCLINATION AND TOTAL FORCE THE COMPLEMENTARY CHARACTER OF THE OPPOSITE AFFECTIONS OF EACH ELEMENT IS MORE EXTENSIVELY MANIFESTED THUS THE DISTURBANCES WHICH INCREASE THE INCLINATION ARE BELOW THE AVERAGE FROM ABOUT NOON AND THE EARLY HOURS AFTER NOON WHEN THOSE WHICH DECREASE IT ARE ABOVE THE AVERAGE AND ARE BELOW THE AVERAGE FROM ABOUT MIDNIGHT AND THE EARLY HOURS AFTER MIDNIGHT WHEN THOSE WHICH INCREASE THE SAME ELEMENT ARE ABOVE THE AVERAGE IN THE TOTAL FORCE FROM 1 AM TO 8 AM THE DISTIURBANCES WHICH INCREASE THE FORCE ARE GREATLY ABOVE AS THOSE WHICH DECREASE THE FORCE ARE GREATLY BELOW THE AVERAGE A CONTRAST WHICH IS REVERSED FROM 1 AM TO 8 AM THE DISTURBANCES WHICH DECREASE THE FORCE BEING THEN GREATLY ABOVE WHILST THOSE WHICH INCREASE IT ARE GREATLY BELOW THE AVERAGE IN NEITHER OF THE TWO ELEMENTS HOWEVER DOES THE COMPLEMENTARY CHARACTER EXCLUSIVELY PREVAIL IT MAY BE REMARKED THAT IN ALL THE INSTANCES WHICH HAVE BEEN THUS BROUGHT INTO VIEW TOUCHING SUCCESSIVELY THE DIURNAL VARIATIONS OF THE DISTURBANCES OF EACH OF THE THREE ELEMENTS THE PARALLEL CASES WHICH HAVE BEEN CITED WHETHER OF IDENTITY OR OF CONTRAST FALL WITHOUT EXCEPTION ON HOMONYMOUS HOURS A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH AFFORDS ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE OF THE SYSTEMATIC CHARACTER OF THE AFFECTIONS OF WHICH WE ARE TREATING THERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE ANY UNIFORM CONTEMPORANEOUS CONNEXION BETWEEN THE PREVALENCE OF EITHER EASTERLY OR WESTERLY DECLINATIONDISTURBANCES AND OF THOSE WHICH EITHER INCREASE OR DECREASE THE INCLINATION OR THE TOTAL FORCE THUS FOR EXAMPLE THE HOURS AT WHICH THE DISTURBANCES WHICH INCREASE THE TOTAL FORCE ARE MOST NOTABLY ABOVE THE AVERAGE ARE FROM 1 PM TO 9 PM WHILST WE FIND THAT FOR HALF THAT PERIOD OR FIROM 1 PM TO 5 PM THE DECLINATIONDISTURBANCES ARE CHARACTERIZED BY A VERY LOW PROPOR TION OF EASTERLY DISTURBANCES AND FOR THE OTHER HALF OF THE PERIOD OR FROM 6 PM TO 9 PM BY A VERY HIGH PROPORTION OF EASTERLY DISTURBANCES AND WITHOUT MULTIPLYING INSTANCES OF DISSINMILARITY IT MAY BE REMARKED GENERALLY THAT THE MORE THE SIX CLASSES OF DISTURBANCES ARE EXAMINED AND COMPARED WITH EACH OTHER THE LESS REASON DOES THERE APPEAR TO CONCLUDE THAT THERE IS ANY UNIFORMT INTERACCOTNPANIMENT OF THE VARIA TIONS OF DIFFERENT ELEMENTS AS THE INSTRUMENT BY WHICH THE VARIATIONS OF THE DECLINATION ARE OBSERVED IS MORE SIMPLE IN CONSTRUCTION THAN THOSE REQUIRED FOR THE VARIATIONS OF THE INCLINATION AND TOTAL FORCE AND THE DISTURBANCES OF THE DECLINATION ARE THEREFORE MORE EASILY OBSERVED AND MORE GENERALLY KNOWN A SOMEWHAT DISPROPORTIONATE CONSIDERATION HAS BEEN FIRE QUENTLY GIVEN TO THEM IN THE DISCUSSION OF THESE PHENOMENA WHICH IT MAY BE DESIRABLE BRIEFLY TO REMARK UPON THUS THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE MAGNETIC DISTURBANCES HAVING BEEN CHIEFLY DRAWN FIOM THOSE OF THE DECLINATION IT HAS BEEN VERY GENERALLYCOLONEL SABINE ON PERIODICAL LAWS DISCOVERABLE AND VERY NATURALLY IMAGINED THAT THE EARLY HOURS OF THE NIGHT OR FROM 8 PM TO 11 PM ARE THOSE AT WHICH MAGNETIC DISTURBANCES PRINCIPALLY TAKE PLACE THAT ABOUT 11 PM OR A LITTLE AFTER THEY BEGIN TO SUBSIDE DISAPPEARING ALMOST WHOLLY IN THE DAYTIME AND REAPPEARING AGAIN POSSIBLY THE FOLLOWING EVENING AT THE SAME HOUR AS ON THE PRECEDING EVENING IN SUPPOSED ANALOGY WITH CERTAIN ATMOSPHERIC DISTURBANCES WHICH MANIFEST A TENDENCY TO RECUR AT THE SAME HOURS ON SUCCESSIVE DAYS IT IS IN THIS SUPPOSED ANALOGY THAT THE TERM OF MAGNETIC STORMS APPEARS TO HAVE ORIGINATED AN EXAMINATION OF THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE THREE ELEMENTS AT BUT A SINGLE STATION AS TORONTO FOR EXAMPLE TEACHES US THAT THIS VIEW REQUIRES TO BE CON SIDERABLY MODIFIED THE DISTURBANCES OF THE DECLINATION WHICH REACH A MAXIMUM AT 9 PM HAVE INDEED ALREADY SUBSIDED CONSIDERABLY AT 11 PM BUT THOSE OF THE INCLINA TION SHOW NO ABATEMENT UNTIL ABOUT 2 AM WHILST THOSE OF THE TOTAL FORCE WHICH ARE MUCH BELOW THEIR AVERAGE VALUE AT 9 PM INCREASE PROGRESSIVELY TO THEIR MAXIMUM WHICH IS ONLY REACHED AT 3 AM OR NEARLY SIX HOURS AFTER THE MAXIMUM OF THE DECLINA TIONDISTURBANCES HAS TAKEN PLACE IN LIKE MANNER THE HOURS OF THE AFTERNOON IN WHICH THE DECLINATION IS BUT LITTLE DISTURBED AND WHICH HAVE BEEN SUPPOSED IN CON SEQUENCE TO BE HOURS IN WHICH AN INTERMISSION OF DISTURBANCE TAKES PLACE ARE SEEN BY THE TABLE TO BE PRECISELY THOSE HOURS AT WHICH THE DISTURBANCES WHICH INCREASE THE TOTAL FORCE HAVE THEIR PRINCIPAL DEVELOPMENT BEING THEN IN THE PROPORTION OF NEARLY TEN TO ONE WHEN COMPARED WITH THE HOMONYMOUS HOURS AFTER MIDNIGHT WHEN THESE REMARKABLE PHENONENA ARE MORE FULLY STUDIED THE ASPECT THEY PRESENT IS THAT OF A DISTURBANCE CONTINUING FREQUENTLY THROUGH SEVERAL SUCCESSIVE DAYS CHANGING FROM ONE ELEMENT TO ANOTHER AND AFFECTING EACH AT DIFFERENT HOURS AND IN DIFFERENT MODES IN CONFORMITY WITH LAWS THE AVERAGE OPERATION OF WHICH IT HAS BEEN THE OBJECT OF THIS INVESTIGATION TO ASCERTAIN AND WEARING THE APPEARANCE CONSEQUENTLY WHEN ONLY A SINGLE ELENLENT IS REGARDED OF A LIMITATION TO THOSE HOURS WHEN THAT ELEMENT IN PAR TICULAR IS AFFECTED BUT WHICH APPEARANCE CEASES WHEN THE PHENONIENA ARE MORE GENERALLY APPREHENDED IT WAS THE SUPPOSED ANALOGY BETWEEN MAGNETICAL AND ATMO SPHERICAL DISTURBANCES WHICH LED IN THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE BRITISH COLONIAL OBSERVATORIES TO THE SIMULTANEOUS OBSERVATIONS AND RECORD OF THESE TWO GREAT AND AS WE HAVE NOW REASON TO BELIEVE DISTINCT BRANCHES OF NATURAL PHENOMENA AND AS THE INQUIRY ADVANCES WE ARE CONTINUALLY BECOMING ACQUAINTED WITH ADDITIONAL CIR CUMSTANCES TO STRENGTHEN THE PERSUASION THAT THE CAUSES OF THESE OCCASIONAL AND PREVIOUSLY SUPPOSED IRREGULAR MANIFESTATIONS OF DISTURBING MAGNETICAL INFLUENCE MUST BE SOUGHT IN A MORE DISTANT SOURCE THAN IN VARIATIONS OF THE METEOROLOGICAL PHENOMENA THERE IS ANOTHER MISAPPREHENSION IN REGARD TO THE NATURE OF THE OCCASIONAL DISTURBANCES WHICH S FOLLOWED VERY NATURALLY FROM THE LIMITATION OF THE VIEW TO THE DISTURBANCES OF A SINGLE ELEMENT AN INFERENCE LHAS SOMETIMES BEEN DRAWN IN FAVOUR OF A LOCAL ORIGIN OF A PARTICULAR DISTURBANCE IN CONTRADISTINCTION TO THE GENERAL FACT OF THEIR SIMULTANEOUS OCCURRENCE AT EXTREMELY DISTANT PARTS OF THE GLOBE FROM 370IN THE MEAN EFFECTS OF THE LARGER MAGNETIC DISTURBANCES 371 THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THOUGH THE DISTURBANCE WAS MANIFESTED BY THE DECLINATION AT ONE STATION NO INDICATION OF IT WAS SHOWN BY THE CONTEMPORANEOUS OBSERVATIONS OF THE DECLINATION AT ANOTHER AND A DISTANT STATION NOW SIMULTANEITY AT STATIONS SEPA RATED BY CONSIDERABLE INTERVALS OF LONGITUDE IMPLIES A DIFFERENCE IN THE SOLAR HOURS AND THE OBSERVATIONS AT TORONTO SHOW THAT A DIFFERENCE IN THE SOLAR HOUR MAY DETER MINE THE QUESTION WHETHER A DISTURBANCE WHICH MAY NEVERTHELESS BE COMMON TO BOTH STATIONS MAY OR MAY NOT BE TRACEABLE AT BOTH BY SIMULTANEOUS OBSERVATIONS OF A SINGLE ELEMENT ONLY TOWARDS THE ATTAINMENT OF A JUST CONCLUSION THEREFORE IN REGARD TO A POSSIBLE LOCAL ORIGIN IT IS INDISPENSABLE THAT A MORE EXTENSIVE GENERAL IZATION SHOULD BE MADE AND THAT CONTEMPORANEOUS AFFECTIONS OF THE THREE ELEMENTS SHOULD BE BROUGHT INTO THE COMPARISON NOR CAN THIS CONDITION OF THE INQUIRY BE DISPENSED WITH EVEN IN COMPARING THE PHENOMENA AT STATIONS UNDER THE SAME MERI DIAN BUT SEPARATED BY LARGE INTERVALS OF LATITUDE UNLESS IT BE FIRST SHOWN THAT THE SAME LAW OF SOLAR HOURS PREVAILS AT BOTH STATIONS IN REGARD TO THE OCCURRENCE OF THE DISTURBANCES OF EACH PARTICULAR ELEMENT IT NEED SCARCELY BE SAID THAT THE GENERAL SIMULTANEITY OF THE DISTURBANCES HAS A VERY IMPORTANT BEARING UPON THEIR THEORY INASMUCH AS IT MILITATES DECIDEDLY AGAINST THE SUPPOSITION OF THEIR ORIGINATING IN ATMOSPHERICAL PECULIARITIES AND TENDS TO ASSIGN THEM WITH FAR GREATER PROBABILITY TO A COSMICAL SOURCE THAT SOME DISTURBANCES MAY HAVE A LOCAL ORIGIN IS UNDOUBTEDLY POSSIBLE BUT NO SUCH CASE HAS YET I BELIEVE BEEN ESTABLISHED ON ADEQUATE EVIDENCE FOR THE PURPOSE OF VIEWING IN ITS SIMPLEST FORM AND EXPRESSED IN NUMERICAL VALUE THE INFLUENCE WHICH ON A DAILY AVERAGE THE LARGER DISTURBANCES EXERCISE ON THE DECLINATION INCLINATION AND TOTAL FORCE WE MUST REVERT TO THE AGGREGATE VALUES IN THE FIVE YEARS WHICH SUPPLIED THE RATIOS OF DISTURBANCE AT THE DIFFERENT HOURS IN EACH OF THE SIX CLASSES OF PHENOMENA CONTAINED IN TABLE IV FROLN THESE VALUES WE OBTAIN READILY AND IMMEDIATELY FOR EACH HOUR THE EXCESS IN THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF EASTERLY OVER WESTERLY OR OF WESTERLY OVER EASTERLY DEFLECTION AND OF DISTURBANCES WHICH INCREASE OR DECREASE THE INCLINATION OR THE TOTAL FORCE OVER THOSE WHICHL RESPECTIVELY DECREASE OR INCREASE THOSE ELEMENTS HENCE WE EASILY FORM A TABLE CON TAINING FOR EACH OF THE ELEMENTS AT EVERY HOUR THE NUMERICAL EXCESS IN THE AGGREGATE VALUES OF WHICHEVER KIND OF DISTURBANCE PREDOMINATES AT THAT HOUR AND BY DIVIDING THE EXCESS BY 1550 WHICH IS THE NUMBER OF DAYS OF OBSERVATION IN THE FIVE YEARS WE HAVE THE MEAN DAILY EFFECT CORRESPONDING TO THE VALUES OF THE LARGER DISTURBANCES OF EACH OF THE ELEMENTS AT THE DIFFERENT HOURS OR THE AVERAGE DIURNAL VARIATION OF EACH ELEMENT DUE TO THE LARGER DISTURBANCES THIS IS SHOWN IN TABLE V IN WHICH THE DIURNAL VARIATION OF THE DECLINATION AND INCLINATION IS EXPRESSED IN DECIMALS OF A MINUTE OF ARC AND THAT OF THE TOTAL FORCE IN PARTS OF THE TOTAL FORCE AT TORONTO

DISTURB ANCES OF EACH ELEMENT WHICH HAVE BEEN SEPARATED BY THE PROCESSES AND SUBJECTED TO THE ANALYSIS DESCRIBED IN THIS COMMUNICATION CAN BY NO MEANS BE SUPPOSED TO INCLUDE THE WHOLE OF THE

CONCLUDING THIS PAPER I MAY VENTURE TO CONGRATULATE THE ROYAL SOCIETY ON THE SUCCESS WHICH HAS ATTENDED THE ATTEMPT COMMENCED AT ITS RECOMMENDATION AND CARRIED OUT UNDER ITS AUSPICES TO INVESTIGATE THE LAWS OF THESE REMARKABLE AND MYSTERIOUS PHENOMENA THE MAGNETIC DISTURBANCES BY THE PHILOSOPHICAL METHOD OF EXTENSIVE AND SYSTEMATIC OBSERVATION AND ON THE PROOF WHICH THIS PAPER CONTAINS OF THE SUFFICIENCY FOR THEIR PURPOSES OF THE INSTTRUMENTAL MEANS DEVISED BY THE CORN MITTEE OF PHYSICS FOR OBSERVING THE VARIATIONS OF THE HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL FORCES AND OF WHICH ESPECIALLY IN REGARD TO THE VERTICAL FORCE MAGNETOMETER DOUBTS HAVE BEEN SOTNETIMES EXPRESSED ARISING APPARENTLY IN SOME CASES FROMN THE WANT OF SUFFICIENT SKILL IN THE ARTIST WHO ATTEMPTED TO CONSTRUCT THE INSTRUMENT AND IN OTHERS FROMN THE ABSENCE OF ANY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IN THOSE WHO EXPRESSED OPINIONS AS TO ITS PROBABLE PERFORMANCE BY MEANS OF THESE TWO INSTRUMENTS A FULL CONFIRMNATION HAS NOW BEEN GIVEN TO THE EXISTENCE OF PERIODICAL LAWS OF SYSTEMATIC ORDER AND REGULARTITY IN PHENO MENA PREVIOUSLY REGARDED AS IRREGULAR THE PERIODICAL CHARACTER OF THE DECENNIAL ANNUAL AND DIURNAL VARIATIONS BEING AS CLEARLY SHOWN BY THE DISTURBANCES OF THE INCLINATION AND TOTAL FORCE AS BY THOSE OF THE DECLINATION THUS ACCOMPLISHING THE FIRST IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS A PHYSICAL THEORY OF THE DISTURBANCES BY THE DIRECT CONNEXION WHICH THEY ARE NOW SHOWN TO HAVE WITH THE SUN THE CONCLUSIONS WHICH CAN BE DRAWN FROM THE OBSERVATIONS AT A SINGLE STATION ARE NECESSARILY LIMITED TO THE THEORY OF THE PHENOMENA AS THEY PRESENT THEMSELVES AT A SINGLE POINT ON THE EARTHS SURFACE MAY IT NOT BE HOPED THAT THE FRUITS WHICH HAVE RECOMPENSED THE LABOUR BESTOWED ON THE TORONTO OBSERVATIONS MAY ENCOURAGE SOME AMONGST THE NUMEROUS PHYSICISTS IN EUROPE AND AMERICA WHO SIGNIFIED THEIR DESIRE TO COOPERATE WITH THE ROYAL SOCIETY IN THIS INQUIRY AND TO ADOPT THE METHODS AND PROCESSES OF OBSERVATION WHICH HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED OUT AT TORONTO TO APPLY THEM SELVES TO THE DEDUCTION OF THE LAWS OF THE OCCASIONAL DISTURBANCES WHICH FROM THE EXAMPLE OF TORONTO THEY MAY EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO DISENTANGLE FIOM THE GREAT MASS OF OBSERVATIONS ON WHICH THEIR LABOUR HAS BEEN ALREADY BESTOWED PROVIDED THAT THOSE OBSERVATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE WITH THE CARE AND PERSEVERANCE WHICH HAVE DISTINGUISHED THOSE MADE BY THE OFFICERS AND NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS OF THE ROYAL ARTILLERY AT THE TORONTO OBSERVATORY FEW MAY BE WILLING TO FACE A HEAVY LABOUR OF REDUCTION BEFORE EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN THAT RESULTS WILL FOLLOW FIOM THE LABOUR

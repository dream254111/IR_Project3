a spear struck the GEovernor in the leg just above the knee with such force as to cause it to protrudetwo feet on the other side which was so far fortunate as it enabled me to break of the barb and withdraw the shaft the Governor notwithstanding his wound continued to direct the party and although the natives made many attempts to approach close ellough to reach us with their spears we were eilabled by keeping on the most open ground and checlsing them by an occasional shot to avoid their attacks in crossing the gullies they followed us closely for 7 miles after which they were only seen occasionally following in our track Having reached the beach we were enabled to travel more rapidly and though one of the ponies knocked up we reached Champion Bay at 3h 30m and got the party and horses on board the  Champion  by 5h P5I where we were fflladly welcomed by Lieut Helpman About sullset the natives carne down to the heach concealing themselves behind the bushes whilst a single

were detained two days by stormy weather This time was profitably employed in arranging our baggage and stores repairing and strengthening our sledges anl in recruiting the dogs On the 30th everythillg being in readiness and the weather fine I started for the coctst with two men Beads and Linklater and two sledges drawn by five dots A fatigue party of three men and two dogs accompanied us to within half a days march of the coast In consequence of a great thAw that had occurred the previous week whicTl cleared much of tlle ground of snow the travelling was exceedingly bad and although long detours were made to finl a good road for the sedges they got much itljured by the stones On the 1st lMay we put en cstche for our return journey a little pemmican and flour and next day when 10 miles from the coast the fatigue party was sent back After experiencing much difficulty in crossing some deep ravines we reached the shore of Ricllardson Bay about 5 mies M7 of the mouth of the Copper mine neclr midday when I was most happy to find that as far as visible the ice to seaward was not unfavourable for travelling Being desirous of walking during tse niht to prevent the glare of the sun on the snow inflatning the eyes we commenced our journey at 10 PM on the 2nd rhe weather was unpleasant with a strong breeze of coll N wind as we directed our course as straight as possible for Point Lockver The ice being smooth and the snow hard we advanced rapidly until 8 AM on the 3rd when we stopped for the day in Jat by observation 68 8 44 N The building of an excellent snowhouse occupied us 14 hour during which our simple cooking was going on so that no time might be lost On the 4th we encamped on the beach 5 miles N of Point Lockyer where we found some wood for cooking and as the weather was fine no snowhut was required the wind was how ever still sharp and a temperature of 10 made a shelter in the form of a semicircular wall of snow agreeable At 9h 15m PM we were again on foot our course being directed towards the NW end of Douglas Island on which we landed at oll 5m AM on the 5th when we cooked a kettle of pemmican and flour with sorne wood picked up and put  en cache a quantity of provisiorls for our return After two hours stay we resumed our march in a nearly NE direction At the same hour as on the previous evening we commenced our nights marcll and a walk of 1 mile brought us to a low point covered with debris of salldstone and limestone and a fewfrom Great Bear Lake to Wollaston Land boulders of granite The land was so low that from our snow 75 house it appeared mueh mre distant Te now turned eastward but had mueh difficulty in keeping alongshore as there were several small bays and islets among which in the hazy weather we had some trouble to finfl our way Under these eircumstances rather than lose time uselessly I determined to travel overland due E leaving the coast to be traeed wherl returning at whiell time the thawing of the snow would have lflid bare a greater extent of the shore and made it more easy to define On our seeond days mareTl over an uninteresting tract of low ground swamps and laLes we arlived at the eoast at 6 AMv on the 7th nearly opposite to some large rocky islands and at a plaee where the shore presented a high sloping front After a two hours walk to the 1E by N alongshore we built our snowhut in lat 68 31 42 N and long 1 11 30t Br under a steep bank sur mounted bysomewhitish limestone and reddish brown sandstone in siu Here luring the interval between takin the observations for time and latitude I shot 10 hares These fine animals were very large and tame and several more might llave been killed as wellas lnany partridges had I thought it expedient to follow them 7th and 8th Ma Our eourse fol the first 5 nziles of this nights march was neary ESE until we rounded a long point and crossed a deep hay in an E direetion some large islands lying outsile at a eouple of miles distance from shore btlt gradually approaching it to within half a mile as we advanced eastuard These islands I named after the distinguished naturalist and traveller Sir John Richarlson The islands as well as the adjacent coast were high rocky and in many places precipitous Specimens of the roeks have been preserved The land now turned impereeptiby northward to Ne 40 E in which direetion we proeeeded 4 miles to the entrance of a narl ow inlet on the AT side of whieh in lat 68 o8 5  long 110 50t we stopped at 8h 30m A1I but built no snowhut as the weather was not bad Previous to taking tTle noon cbservation and whilst supper was cooking I examined the inlet hoping to find it a passage leading to the northward but a walk ov 2 1 miles undeceived me Several deer were seen but as we had abundance of provisions no attempt was made to approach them On the rlight of tile 8th the weather was so stormy with thick snow that we could not travel we therefore built a snowhouse and made ourselves comfortable occupying our time repairing shoes making up calculations c Next night the s7eather having becorne better vve resumed our march and travelled neary 3 miles rather to the southward76 Dr JOHN RAE s Jourazey of E then E 17 mile after Thich ve crossed a point 2 miles broad in the same direction Mre now traversed a considerable bayS with low shores our course beiIlg E by N To this bay I gave the name of Wellank after one of the directors of the Hudsorls Bay Company As we travelled onward the land continued low and had an easterly trending during the remainder of our nights walk which was llOt continued so long as usual the weather being extremely cold for the season The thermometer showed a temperature of 22 below zero mhich made the shelter of our snowhut more than usually acceptable One of the men got rather deeply frost bitten in the face and the taking of a set of lunar distances was rather unpleasant work I have generally found indeed that a temperature which in winter would be pleasant is in the latter part of spring almost insupportably cold The latitude of our position was 680 37 48 N by observation longitude by account 110 2 The farthest point of land about 6 miles distant bore ESE so that it appeared unnecessary to travel farther in this direction as my survey alld that of Messrs Dease alld Simpson must have met here although our latitudes do not agree mlne being some distance S of theirs There were now two modes of proceeding open to me the one being to strike overland to the N in search of the seacoast the other to return along the coast atld travel westward in hopes that some of the spaces of BTollaston Land left blank in the charts might prove to be the desired strait I chose the latter of these modes because to travel overland ill a northerly direction would be very difficult and fatiguing and would always be getting more so as the ridges of land most of which were already clear of snow lay across our line of route so that a few days of warm weather would have made travelling with slelges and dogs very diflicult if not wholly impracticable The night of tile 10th was very stormy with thick snowdrift but the wind being in our backs we conlmenced our return to our previous days restingplace After walking some time we fell upon our old track which sax ed me much troulJle in taking bearings as they would have been often requlsite the snow falling so thick that we could not see to the distance of 20 yards After a very cold but smart walk of rather more than 7 hours duration we were glad to find ourselves snug ullder cover of our old quar ters our clothes beirlg penetrated in every direction with the finely powdered snow The weather on the night of the 11th continued so bad that we were obliged to remaill indoors but the followin night was fine cllough to allow us to proceed westward by our former trackfrom Great Bear Late to Wollaston Land 77 Our jourrley to Douglas Islarld was fcavourable The coast from lat 68 3140 N and long 111 30 W up to Cape Lady Franklin in lat 68 29 and long 113 5 was with the exception of one high rocky point lowf and indented with many bays of small extent the general direction being nearly MT The weather colltinuel good so that we arrived at the NW extremity of Dollglas Islcmd at a few minutes to 8 AM on the 1 5th when we found abundance of driftwood to cook with As to return by Douglas Island would lead us out of the straitht road homewards when we started on the 16th for Wellastoll Land we carried with US the provisions we had pre viously put en caCle We lirected our course to the most distant visible point bearing about NNW and follnd that it was 9 miles distant but in reaching it we were much delayed by rough ice ill roundina which we increased the length of our walk very much and a very heaxy fall of snow stopped our farther advance Our next nightvs journey was rather long to make up for the time lost 1QY the bad weather For 13 miles our course was about NNW along a series of bays and points the coast then ran N for some distance alld afterwards slightly to the eastward until we encamped on a small peninsula near the head of a bay irl lat 69 1 long 113 25 both by accoullt 17th and 18th lMay 7Te walked for 2 miles N 28 W which brought IlS to a pOillt in which we deposited some pemmican c having made another cacAle about 7 miles from our former days sleepingplace We also left here a small sledge on which I had hauled from 35 to 50 lbsz since leaving Elichardsons BayX two days excepted AVe now trclversed a deep and wide bay in direction of N 4 v towards some high bills which ap peared to be not very far off but finding that we could not reach the coast there I turned more to the tlorthward and ended our nights walk on the r point of a small bay in lat 69 17t30tr long1147XV Being ansious to discover how the land looked tcx the north ward and as a high hill about 13 miles inland would afford the opportunity of obtaining a very distallt viemr our next days journey alongshore was only 5 miles the course being W Here I lett tlle dogs and baggage under the care of one of tlle men whilst with the other I set out for the hill already men tioned but ullfortunately the walking was so bad that although we were quite uIlencuTnbered we could get llO farther than 10 miles when we returned rather fatigued to our eleepingplace Many partridges Tetrao mutus were seen but they were so shy that only 11 u7ere shot These hirds are large and fine eatirlg To the large bay we had just traced and to a range of hills78 Dr JOIIN RAE s Journey of whieh the most prominent is the one I attempted to reach I gave the names of Sirpson and Colvile in honour of the Go verrlorinChief and Governor of the Hudsons Bay Companys territories During the jourtley of the 1 9th and 20th tlle trending of the eoast was still to the W as far as our sleepingplaee on a point with high linlestone eliSs lat 699 15t 54Jt N5 long 115 24 54  AY The next night our eourse was to the N of v until within a mile or two of the end of our nights walk which was in nearly a N direetion to the head of a small bay whele ve took up our quarters in lat 69 24 57 long 116D 23 34 On the 21st and 22nd we travelled rlearly NW for 5 miles which brought us to a eapg with lirilestone elifE at least 1 v O feet high This eape was named after Captain Hamilton RNT Secretary to the Admiralty A eouple of liles to seaward there were 1tS Esquimaus lodges and we hal all amieable interview with the poor harmless in habitants who were rather timil at first but soon gained eonfi denee It was liflitult to make theln understand that no retllrn was expeeted for some presents I made them None of the women showed themselves but all the men were well and eleanly dressfecl in deerskin lahey were all very fat Ilaving evidently abulldanee of seals flesh and fat large quantities of llieh were eclrefully deposited in sealskin bags under the snow WYe pur ehased a quantity of this for our dogs and some boots shoes and sealskins for our own use After a most friendly interchange of signs and words few of which could le ulllerstood on either side we parted after six of them had walked some listance with us both parties apparently equally well pleased with the meeting Our course was now N 36 V acloss a bay 11 miles wide the N side of whicll svas bollnded by a curiouslyshaped point which I called Pullen after the Commanler in the Navy of that name who successfully performel the voyage frorn the vvestward of Point Barrow to the MKenzie River in 1849 To the bay the name of Lady Richardson was given Three miles farther in the salne direction brought llS to all island hich vas the terminus of our nights journey This island is ighx but not rocky and about 3 miles long It received the name of Bell after a chief trader in the lJudsorls Bay Companys service Near it to the E there is a small islet covered with large pieces of rued liInestone Next night our course for 72 rtliles was N 33 V to a point with limestone precipice 70 or 80 feet high The coast then roundel 1lp to the northward until it attained a nearly N direction and for a mile lefore we ended our nights walk a lAiNE course into a small bay where we rested for the day in lat 70 00 23 N long 117 16 35 AVf rom Great Bear LaAe to Wollaston Land 79 The period I had allowed for our outward journey having now arrived I left our dogs and one of tlle men here whilst with the other I travelled half a days journey farther At Sh 30m on the 23rd the night was beautiful as we started with no other encumbrance than a gun teleseope and compass so that we travelled fast over the hard snow and ice After walking 2 miles to the NW we turned a cape whieh received the name of Baring in honcuur of the First Lord of the Admiralty beyond whieh the eoast took a sudlen berld to E by N for 8 miles and then beeame more northerly for 6t miles which was the farthest point reached A high eape whieh was called after Sir George Back bore N 73 E about 7 lniles distant and bounded ollr view of the coast in that direction Near the place from whieh I turned baek the land vwas fully 300 feet high from which objects eould be seen at a great dis tance and some land 15 or 20 miles offwas observed the most westerly point bearing N 25 A7J the view of its more distant eastern extremity being olstrueted by Cape Baek It is diffieult to determine whether the water lividing these tsvo shores is a bay or a strait but frozn the little information I eould obtain from the Esquimaux I suspeet it to be the latter Unfor tunately want of time a3 the intelaests of the summer voyage with the boats requiIed my presenee at this plaee would not allow me to decide tllis question Our return was effiected at the same quiek paee as our outward journey and we arrived at our bzvouac after an absenee of 10 hours with excellent appetites for supper to whieh as usual we did ample Justiee On the 24th of May at 811 25m PM we ecummenced our homeward route the details of which I shall not trouble you with merely remarking that the bearings and distances were earefully eheeked and several oleservations for latitude xtariation and time obtained which the eloudy state of the weather prevented being taken previously NVhere tbe depth of the bays was at all doubtful I made a circuit round them whilst the men and dogs followed the straight route NVe had several more interviews with the Esquinlaux all equally friendly as the first At one of tile tents two of the women made their appearance and were not in the slightest de gree timid All the land near the coast from Cape Lady Franklin to Cape Baring is so extremely barren that although many deer cross from the main they do not remain near the shore but make their way directly inland too far for persons travelling as we were and abundantly supplied with food to follow them  The Copperuline River Eso Dr JOHN RAE s Journey On the 30th of May we reached our cache of the 16th and found it as well as two others perfectly saft notwithstandillg that one or perhaps all of them had been seen by the Esquimaux On the night of the 30th we crossed over in as direct a line as the rough ice wotlld permit to the high rocky point N of Cape Krusenstern traversillg a portion of Lambert Island on the way Next night we reached the S side of Poillt Lockyer where a laughing goose Anser albifrons was shot and water was ob tained without thawing snow On the 2nd of June the extremity of Cape Hearne formed our healquarter3 at which place eleven geese all in fine condition were killed Being anxious to know if a deposit of provisions left in Icy Cove by Sir John Richardson in 1848 and examined by me ill 1849 was still safe I deviated balfadays journey from our direct route in order to visit it but a deep snowdrift prevented my attaining my object As the Esquimaux appear to have a great respect for caches of any kind I believe it is still quite safe unless destroyed by wet or tlle barrenground bear Our next sleepingplace was 7 llliles NW of Cape Kendall Here ten geese were shotand double that nurnber might have been got had we required them At 7h 50m AMv on the 4th of June we encampel on the S shore of Richardson Bay 2 miles E of where we stopped on the 2nd of May During the last 2 days there was much water on the ice and it was evidently high time that our journey should be approaching its conclusion As the consumption of provisions for the coast journey began here it may not be out of place to mention that tbe quantity used in 33 days was 54 lbs of flour and 128 lbs of pemmic tn or nearly 2 lbs for each person per diem with 14 lb of tea 2 lbs of chocolate and 10 lbs of sugar for all the party during the same time We stayetl a day here to arrange loads for ourselves and dogs and to make a cache amotlg the r ocks of 30 lbs of pemmican 20 lbs grease fuel remaining and several other things which we did not require to carry with us On the Sth of June betwfeen 9 and 10 PM we started for the Rendall lightly laden atld caule on to within 4 miles of our cache of provisions made on the 1st May One of tlae men was sent to examine it but found that everytning except an axe had been either eaten or destroyed by a barrenground bear We saw a very lare one next day probably the very fellow that had robbed us but he was too wary to allow us to get within shot of him possibly he may be less successful in avoiding us on our return to the coast Orl the 9th when 9 miles from this a large muskbull wasfrom Great Bear LAe to Wollaston Land 81 shotS and his flesh was found excellent lhe skeleton will be preserved A short time after lnidday on the 10th we arrived here having been 5 days coming from the coast during some of which we were 14 hours on foot and continually wading through icecoll water or wet snow svhich was too deep to allow our Esquimaux boots to be of any uses The latter part of our journey if not the most fatiguing was by far the most disagreeable Through every hollow alld valley a stream more or less large flowed some of them so deep and rapid that we had often to walk 3 or 4 miles out of our course to find a ford and even then it was so difficult to keep on our feet that one of the men fell and lost all our cooking utensils plates pans and sponns so that for two days we were obliged to use stones as substitutes Our principal fool was geese partridges antl lemmings The latter being very fat and large were very fine when roasted before the fire or between two stones These little animals were migrating northwavd and were so numerous that our dogs as they trotted orl killel as many as supportel them without any other food The dogs did their work well considering their leanness when we set ollt hafl they been in better condition I have no hesita tion in saying that our daily journeys would have been 3 or 4 miles longer Wre were fFequently delayed by routh ice but when this happened we made up for lost time by additional exertion either on the same or subsequent days I subjoirl a note of the daily and total distances travelled counting this place as our startingpoint I beg to enclose a very rough tracing of the coast examined It has been done in great haste and without pretensions to great accuracy as I have many of my calculations to revise and several sets of lunar distances to work out Some islands are also omitted and the positions of others may require alteratioll In conclusion permit me to observe that the conduct of the two men who accompanied me has been excellent and they as well as myself are in a much better state for commencing another such journey than when we left Fort Confidence Apologising for the hurried manner in which this is writtell my only excuse being the anxiety I feel that it should be sent oS with the least possible delay 1 have c JOIIN RAE lOL SXIT a 82 Dr JOHN RAFS recent Exploratiowls DISTANCE TRAVELLED Kendall River to

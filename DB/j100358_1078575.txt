EDUCATION IN COOPERATION WITH THE FOOD ADMINISTRATION OF THE UNITED STATES PUBLISHED A SERIES OF LESSONS ENTITLED LESSONS IN COMMU NITY AND NATIONAL LIFE THESE LESSONS DEALT WITH TOPICS APPRO PRIATE TO CLASSES STUDYING COMMUNITY CIVICS THERE WERE LESSONS ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE RELATIONS ON COLONIAL AND MODERN MANUFACTURING METHODS AND ON OTHER SUBJECTS NOT LIKELY TO EXCITE ANY QUESTION IN THE MINDS OF THE MOST CONSERVATIVE STUDENTS OF SOCIETY IN THE COURSE OF THE PREPARATION OF LESSONS ON SOCIETY IT BECAME NECESSARY FOR THE EDITORS OF THIS SERIES TO INTRODUCE SOME MATTERS WHICH ARE LESS COMMONLY DISCUSSED IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS THE FACT THAT THERE ARE LABOR ORGANIZATIONS AND THAT THESE ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENT A DEFINITE MOVEMENT THE SCHOOL REVIEW IS PUBLISHED MONTHLY FROM SEPTEMBER TO JUNE BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO IT IS EDITED AND MANAGED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AS ONE OF A SERIES OF EDUCATIONAL PUBLICATIONS THE SERIES INCLUDING ALSO THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 7OURNAL AND THE

CONNECTICUT FRED C AYER SEATTLE WASHINGTON H L MILLER MADISON WISCONSIN 205206 THE SCHOOL REVIEW IN THE INDUSTRIAL WORLD WHICH MUST BE RECOGNIZED WAS DISCUSSED IN CERTAIN OF THE LESSONS THE PROBLEMS OF SOCIAL INSURANCE AND GOVERNMENTAL CONTROL OF INDUSTRIES WERE DISCUSSED THE EDITORS WERE VERY CAREFUL TO SEE TO IT THAT IN ALL OF THESE DIS CUSSIONS EXAMPLES WERE CHOSEN FROM SUCH SOURCES THAT THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT WOULD BE IN NO WISE COMPROMISED THROUGH THE PUBLICATION OF THE ACCOUNTS BY THE BUREAU OF EDUCATION FORTUNATELY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS TAKEN A GOOD DEAL OF INTEREST IN A NUMBER OF THESE MATTERS AND IN THE REPORTS OF A NUMBER OF COMMISSIONS AS WELL AS IN ACTUAL LEGISLATION THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS SHOWN ITSELF TO BE A PROGRESSIVE SOCIAL AGENCY THE LESSONS PREPARED BY THE BUREAU FOUND A WIDE USE IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF THE UNITED STATES NOW COMES THE REACTION ON THE PART OF CONSERVATIVES THIS REACTION IS SIGNIFI CANT BECAUSE IT INDICATES THE SOURCES OF OPPOSITION TO A TYPE OF STUDY WHICH IS SURE TO BECOME INCREASINGLY COMMON IN THE SCHOOLS OF THIS COUNTRY IT IS IDLE TO BELIEVE THAT A NATION THAT HAS BEEN AS DEEPLY STIRRED AS HAS THIS WILL SHUT ITS EYES AND ITS MIND TO A DISCUSSION OF SOCIAL PROBLEMS IT IS ALSO IDLE TO BELIEVE THAT THE CHILDREN IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF THIS COUNTRY ARE TO REMAIN UNINFORMED ON MATTERS OF PROGRESSIVE SOCIAL LEGISLATION THAT THE MEAGER AND VERY CAREFUL DISCUSSION OF THESE PROBLEMS IN THE LESSONS PUBLISHED BY THE BUREAU WAS ENOUGH TO STIR UP OPPOSITION IS MADE CLEAR BY THE FOLLOWING EXTRACT FROM A NEW YORK DAILY OF JANUARY 24 MAGNUS W ALEXANDER MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL CONFERENCE BOARD HAS MADE AN ATTACK HERE UPON A TEXTBOOK LESSONS IN COMMUNITY AND NATIONAL LIFE WHICH HE SAID SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR LANE WAS ATTEMPTING TO INTRODUCE INTO THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF THE COUNTRY WITH THE APPROVAL OF PRESIDENT WILSON ADDRESSING THE NATIONAL BOOT AND SHOE MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION MR ALEXANDER ASKED ITS COOPERATION TO INDUCE THE INTERIOR DEPARTMENT TO WITHEDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT 207 DRAW ITS SUPPORT OF THE BOOK BEFORE IT REALLY BEGAN ITS INSIDIOUS WORK IN THE SCHOOLS HE DOUBTED IF THE PRESIDENT COULD POSSIBLY HAVE SEEN WHAT WAS TO FOLLOW HIS ADVOCACY OF THE WORK THE SPEAKER ASSERTED THAT THE BOOK CONTAINED UNWARRANTED PROPAGANDA FAVORING SOCIAL INSURANCE INDUSTRIAL INSURANCE LABOR UNIONISM AND GOVERN MENTAL CONTROL OF PRIVATE ACTIVITY ONE EFFECT OF THIS ATTACK BY MR ALEXANDER IS EXHIBITED IN THE FOLLOWING EDITORIAL FROM THE CAPITAL DAILY PRESS OF BIS MARCK NORTH DAKOTA THIS EDITORIAL IS QUOTED NOT BECAUSE THE WRITER OF THE PRESENT EDITORIAL SYMPATHIZES FULLY WITH ALL OF ITS VIEWS BUT BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT ANY EFFORT TO CLOSE THE SCHOOLS TO A FULL CONSIDERATION OF SOCIAL PROBLEMS IS SURE TO AROUSE VIOLENT PARTISAN FEELINGS AND MISINTERPRETATIONS WILSON CALLED A BOLSHEVIK PRESIDENT WILSON RECENTLY SAW FIT TO WRITE A FOREWORD INDORSING A BOOK LESSONS IN COMMUNITY AND NATIONAL LIFE BY PROFESSORS JUDD AND MARSHALL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO THIS BOOK IS USED AS A TEXTBOOK IN CERTAIN SCHOOLS THIS HAS CAUSED AN INDIGNANT CLAMOR FROM OUR AMERICAN JUNKERS M W ALEXANDER MANAGER OF THE NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL COUNCIL BOARDWHATEVER THAT ISSEVERELY CONDEMNED THE BOOK AT A CONVENTION OF THE NATIONAL SHOE MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION AND APPEALED TO THE BOOTMAKERS TO BRING ALL POSSIBLE PRESSURE TO BEAR UPON CONGRESS TO STOP THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE BOOK IN THE SCHOOLS MR ALEXANDER TERMED THE BOOK A MENACE TO THE INHERENT RIGHTS OF THE JUVENILE POPULATION TO BE FREE UNTIL THEY HAVE ATTAINED SUFFICIENT MATURITY TO CHOOSE FOR THEMSELVES THE COURSE THEY INTEND TO PURSUE IN LIFE THE BOOK IT SEEMS FAVORS SOCIAL INSURANCE LABOR UNIONISM THE EIGHT HOUR DAY AND GOVERNMENT CONTROL OF PUBLIC UTILITIES THIS OF COURSE IS SUFFICIENT TO CONDEMN IT IN THE EYES OF STUPID BOURBONS LIKE MR ALEXANDER AND THEY ARE GREATLY CONCERNED LEST ANY SUCH DOCTRINE BECOME INCULCATED IN THE PLASTIC MINDS OF OUR YOUTH THIS UPROAR IS SCREAMINGLY FUNNY FOR GENERATIONS THE REACTIONARIES HAVE MAINTAINED THEIR GRIP ON THE CONTROL OF OUR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND FROM THE KINDERGARTEN TO COLLEGE THE PLASTIC MINDS OF OUR YOUTH HAVE BEEN SEDULOUSLY TAUGHT THE SUPERIOR SACREDNESS OF PRIVATE PROPERTY AND THE SUPREM ACY OF DOLLAR RIGHTS OVER HUMAN RIGHTS THIS IS THE ONE THING THAT HAS MADE20O8 THE SCHOOL REVIEW POLITICAL AND INDUSTRIAL PROGRESS SO DISAPPOINTINGLY SLOW IN ORDER TO GAIN CONVERTS TO THE CAUSE OF SOCIAL JUSTICE IT HAS BEEN NECESSARY TO OFFSET THE FALSE AND PERNICIOUS DOCTRINE DELIBERATELY TAUGHT IN THE SCHOOLS AND REEDUCATE PEOPLE TO THE REAL FACTS OF POLITICAL ECONOMY AND THE GENUINE FUNDAMENTALS OF LIFE THIS PERVERSION OF EDUCATION AND PROSTITUTION OF LEARNING HAS BEEN THE STRONGEST BULWARK OF ENTRENCHED PRIVILEGE MORE THAN ANY OTHER ONE THING IT HAS ENABLED THE PROFITEERS TO FOOL THE PEOPLE AND RETAIN THEIR UNFAIR MONOPOLIES NO WONDER SPOKESMEN OF BIG BUSINESS PROTEST WHEN A BOOK WHICH EVI DENTLY DISCUSSES MODERN INDUSTRIAL PROBLEMS ACCIDENTALLY CREEPS INTO THE SCHOOLS NO WONDER THEY BECOME ALMOST HYSTERICAL AT THE PROSPECT THAT THE PLASTIC MINDS OF OUR YOUTH MAY BE FED WITH FACTS INSTEAD OF BEING CUNNINGLY POISONED BY CAPITALISTIC PROPAGANDA NO WONDER THEY CALL PRESIDENT WILSON A BOLSHEVIK BECAUSE HE HAS INDORSED SUCH A WORK IT IS VERY AMUSING WATCHING THESE KING CANUTES OF PRIVILEGE VAINLY TRYING TO SWEEP BACK THE TIDES OF DEMOCRACY WHICH ARE SOON TO OVERWHELM THEM AND IN THE MEANTIME THEY ARE ADVERTISING THE BOOK AND IT PROBABLY WILL RUN INTO FRESH EDITIONS THE SENSIBLE THING WOULD HAVE BEEN TO HAVE BOUGHT UP ALL THE COPIES AND QUIETLY SUPPRESSED THE WORK NOW IT IS TOO LATE MR ALEXANDER WILL FIND THAT ADVERTISING PAYS HE ALSO WILL FIND THAT YOU CANT IMPRISON AN IDEA OR SUPPRESS FACTS BY CONGRESSIONAL ENACTMENT EVEN THE SCHOOLSLONG THE STRONGHOLD OF PRIVILEGEARE LEARNING THE TRUTH AND IT SPELLS THE SPEEDY DOOM OF OUR REACTIONARY MR ALEXANDERS AND ALL THESE STUPID SPOKESMEN STAND FOR NOR DOES THE REACTION AGAINST MR ALEXANDERS POSITION COME MERELY FROM THE RADICAL PAPERS OF THE NORTHWEST THE NEW YORK WORLD REPORTS IN A FULL COLUMN THE MEETING AT WHICH MR ALEXANDER SPOKE THE REPORTER AT THIS MEETING EVIDENTLY HAD A SUFFICIENT SENSE OF HUMOR TO SEE THE ABSURDITY OF MR ALEXANDERS REMARKS AND WRITES AT SOME LENGTH ABOUT THE WHOLE SITUATION DELEGATES TO THE CONVENTION OF THE NATIONAL BOOT AND SHOE MANUFACTUR ERS ASSOCIATION AT THE HOTEL ASTOR WEDNESDAY WERE ALARMED WHEN MAGNUS W ALEXANDER MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL CONFERENCE BOARD TOLD THEM THAT THE GOVERNMENT IN PUBLISHING A SERIES OF LESSONS INEDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT 209 COMMUNITY AND NATIONAL LIFE WAS SPREADING INSIDIOUS UNWARRANTED PROPA GANDA PARTICULARLY INJURIOUS FOR READING BY YOUTH IN THE PLASTIC AGE WHEN YOUTH IS INCLINED TO TAKE FOR GRANTED AND AS PROVED ALL THAT IS SAID THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF THE BOOKS IN HIS CLASSROOM THE DELEGATES WERE STILL MORE ALARMED WHEN MR ALEXANDER TOLD THEM THESE LESSONS WERE SPONSORED BY PRESIDENTWILSON BACKED BY SECRETARY LANE AND DISTRIBUTED AMONG THE SCHOOLS WHERE THEY WOULD MOULD OPINION IN FAVOR OF SOCIAL INSURANCE LABOR UNIONISM THE EIGHTHOUR DAY INDUSTRIAL INSURANCE AND GOVERNMENTAL CONTROL OF PRIVATE ACTIVITY A REPORTER FOR THE WORLD WAS ALARMED TOO AND LOOKED UP THE LESSONS HE FOUND THAT THEY WERE PUBLISHED LAST YEAR THAT THEY BORE THE IMPRINT OF THE BUREAU OF EDUCATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR IN COOPERATION WITH THE UNITED STATES FOOD ADMINISTRATION AND THAT THEY HAD BEEN PRE PARED UNDER THE DIRECTION OF CHARLES H JUDD DIRECTOR OF THE SCHOOL OF EDU CATION UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO AND LEON C MARSHALL DEAN OF THE SCHOOL OF COMMERCE AND ADMINISTRATION UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO WHICH THE REPORTER RECALLED WAS ENDOWED BY THE WELLKNOWN SOCIALIST JOHN D ROCKEFELLER MORE ALARMED THAN EVER THE REPORTER FOUND IT WAS QUITE TRUE THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD SPONSORED THE LESSONS FOR UNDER DATE OF AUGUST 23 1917 HE WROTE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE TO SCHOOL OFFICERS THE WAR IS BRINGING TO THE MINDS OF OUR PEOPLE A NEW APPRECIATION OF THE PROBLEMS OF NATIONAL LIFE AND A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE MEANING AND AIMS OF DEMOCRACY  I URGE THAT TEACHERS AND OTHER SCHOOL OFFI CERS INCREASE MATERIALLY THE TIME AND ATTENTION DEVOTED TO INSTRUCTION BEAR ING DIRECTLY ON THE PROBLEMS OF COMMUNITY AND NATIONAL LIFE IN ORDER THAT THERE MAY BE DEFINITE MATERIAL AT HAND WITH WHICH THE SCHOOLS MAY AT ONCE EXPAND THEIR TEACHING I HAVE ASKED MR HOOVER AND COMMISSIONER CLAXTON TO ORGANIZE THE PROPER AGENCIES FOR THE PREPARATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF SUITABLE LESSONS FOR THE ELEMENTARY GRADES AND FOR THE HIGHSCHOOL CLASSES AND SO THREE BOOKS OF 264 PAGES EACH WERE PREPARED AND PUBLISHED BOUND IN MANILA PAPER OF CADET GRAY BEARING ON THEIR COVERS THE BULL BUFFALO THAT IS THE CREST OF SECRETARY LANES DEPARTMENT AND PROCURABLE FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT OF DOCUMENTS GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE WASHINGTON DC AT 25 AND I5 CENTS A COPY THE REPORTER WAS ALMOST TOO ALARMED TO READ EVEN THE TABLE OF CONTENTS OF SERIES B WHICH IS FOR THE FIRST CLASS OF THE HIGH SCHOOL AND THE UPPER GRADES210 THE SCHOOL REVIEW OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BUT WHEN HE FOUND THAT LESSON BI DEALT WITH THE EFFECT OF WAR ON COMMERCE IN NITRATE HE TOOK A CHANCE HE FELT HIS WAY ON TO LESSON B4 AND HAD HIS FEARS BROUGHT BACK TO NEW LIFE THIS MEANS THAT THE PEOPLE OF CHICAGO ATE MORE THAN 444000000 EGGS IN A YEAR IF ALL THESE EGGS WERE LAID END TO END THEY WOULD MORE THAN REACH FROM THE CANADIAN BOUNDARY TO THE GULF OF MEXICO BUT THERE WAS WORSE TO COME IN LESSON B7 THE REPORTER EVEN THOUGH HE IS PAST THE PLASTIC AGE BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND MR ALEXANDERS BELIEF THAT THE IDEAS THIS BOOK SEEKS TO IMPART ARE SOCIALISTIC LISTEN IN MANY CITY HOMES IN THE TENEMENT DISTRICTS THE CHILDREN DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH FOOD FOR EXAMPLE THEY HAVE FOR BREAKFAST A PIECE OF BREAD AND A CUP OF SOCALLED COFFEE THAT IS NEITHER ENOUGH NOR IS IT OF THE RIGHT KIND THE CHILD WOULD BE MUCH BETTER WITHOUT THE COFFEE AND HE OUGHT TO HAVE SOME FAT WITH THE BREAD IT DID NOT SEEM POSSIBLE THAT THE LESSONS COULD GO BEYOND THAT BUT THEY DO IN B12 WHERE IT IS BLUNTLY DECLARED WITH THE CORPORATION MATTERS ARE VERY DIFFERENT THE OWNERS ARE VERY NUMEROUS THEY MAY NOT EVEN BE ACQUAINTED WITH ONE ANOTHER THEY DO NOT RUN THE BUSINESS IN ANY PERSONAL WAY THEY ELECT A BOARD OF DIRECTORS THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPOINTS A MANAGER THE FINAL RESULT IS THAT IN SOME CONCERNS THERE ARE A THOUSAND OR MORE OWNERS SCATTERED OVER SEVERAL DIFFERENT COUNTRIES WHO KNOW LITTLE OR NOTHING ABOUT THE BUSINESS AND SOME OF THEM CARE LITTLE OR NOTHING ABOUT IT THEY ARE INTERESTED MAINLY IN THE RATE OF DIVIDENDS THEY RECEIVE AND AS TO LABOR UNIONS LESSON B29 CONCLUDES IN THIS DEPLORABLE FASHION PEOPLE DIFFER VERY MUCH IN THEIR OPINION OF LABOR ORGANIZATIONS SOME THINK THAT THESE ORGANIZATIONS SERVE NO GOOD PURPOSE AND ARE INDEED DAN GEROUS OTHERS THINK THAT THEY ARE VERY HELPFUL NOT ONLY TO THE WORKER BUT TO THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE THE TRUTH IS THAT THERE ARE GOOD UNIONS AND BAD UNIONS GOOD UNION POLICIES AND BAD UNION POLICIES LIKE MOST OTHER INSTITU TIONS THEY ARE GOOD OR BAD ACCORDING TO THE USE WHICH IS MADE OF THEM LIKE THE SCORPION SERIES B OF THE LESSONS CARRIES ITS STING IN ITS TAIL LES SON B3I THE LAST PICTURES CONDITIONS IN A FACTORY WHERE EMPLOYMENT MAN AGEMENT IS INSTALLED THE FACTORY IS REPRESENTED AS BELONGING TO THE SUM MIT NOTE THE INSIDIOUS CHOICE OF A NAME MANUFACTURING COMPANY ONE MR SEATON HAS TAKEN EMPLOYMENT THERE SAFETY DEVICES ARE PROVIDED TO PROTECT HIM AGAINST THE RAPIDLY MOVING BELTS AND SHAFTS IF HE IS INJURED IN SPITE OF THESE PRECAUTIONS OR IF HE FALLSEDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT 211 ILL FIRSTAID MEDICAL CARE IS PROVIDED AT THE FACTORY AND THE FACTORY PHYSICIAN AND NURSE FOLLOW HIM TO HIS HOME IF HE CANNOT WORK FOR A TIME WORKMENS COMPENSATION IN CASE OF ACCI DENT OR HEALTH INSURANCE IN CASE OF SICKNESS IS PAID HIM IF HE HAS A GRIEVANCE AGAINST HIS FOREMAN OR A FELLOW WORKMAN OR IF HE IS DISSATISFIED WITH A RULE OR A TOOL A SHOP COMMITTEE ON WHICH THE WORKERS ARE REPRESENTED WILL HEAR HIS COMPLAINT AND ADJUST IT FAIRLY I ALL THESE ARE PART OF AN ENLIGHTENED LABOR POLICY WHICH IS NOW CARRIED OUT BY OUR MORE PROGRESSIVE FACTORIES AND STORES WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE CAR RIED OUT UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE EMPLOYMENT DEPARTMENT OR BY A MEDICAL DEPARTMENT OR BY A SOCALLED WELFARE DEPARTMENT THEY ARE ALL INVOLVED IN EMPLOYMENT MANAGEMENT FOR EMPLOYMENT MANAGEMENT MEANS THE DEVEL OPMENT AND WISE UTILIZATION OF THE HUMAN RESOURCES OF THE PLANT THIS WHOLE DISCUSSION FURNISHES A LEGITIMATE OPPORTUNITY TO CALL ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT THE SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN VERY DEFICIENT IN TIMES PAST IN THEIR TREATMENT OF SOCIAL PROBLEMS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE SCHOOLS HAVE NOT VENTURED TO ENTER THIS FIELD IS UNDOUBTEDLY TO BE FOUND IN THE ATTITUDE OF CON SERVATIVES LIKE MR ALEXANDER AND THE FEAR THAT TEACHERS ARE UNDER OF OFFENDING BOARDS OF EDUCATION AND OTHERS OF THAT TYPE THE TIME HAS COME WHEN THERE OUGHT TO BE A VERY CLEAR AND EXPLICIT ASSERTION ON THE PART OF EDUCATIONAL PEOPLE THAT THEY WILL NOT BE DOMINATED BY SUCH CRITICISM AS IS HERE PRESENTED THE SCHOOLS OF A DEMOCRACY HAVE A RIGHT TO DISCUSS DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR MATTERS IF THE SCHOOL PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY ARE NOT AROUSED BY THIS AND OTHER TYPES OF OPPOSITION TO AN ASSERTION OF THEIR NDEPENDENCE IN EDUCATIONAL MATTERS IT IS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY CAN CLAIM IN ANY LARGE WAY TO BE LEADERS OF PUBLIC OPINION EVEN FOR THE COMING GENERATION THE MANU FACTURERS ASSOCIATION HAS REPEATEDLY MADE THE EFFORT TO CONTROL AND DIRECT PUBLIC EDUCATION IN THIS COUNTRY IT HAS STRIVEN IN MANY STATES AND EVEN THROUGH AGENCIES SET UP BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO DIVIDE THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM INTO TWO SEPARATE PARTS IT HAS ATTEMPTED TO BRING IT ABOUT THAT A CERTAIN GROUP212 THE SCHOOL REVIEW OF CHILDREN WHO ARE EXPECTED TO SPEND THEIR LIVES LABORING IN FACTORIES SHALL HAVE A MEAGER EDUCATION VERY LARGELY DEVOTED TO THE CULTIVATION OF SKILL OF HAND THE AGENCIES WHICH HAVE STRIVEN IN THIS COUNTRY TO DIVIDE THE SCHOOL SYSTEM SUPPORTED THEIR CONTENTIONS FOR A LONG TIME BY REFERENCES TO THE GERMAN EXAMPLE OF EFFICIENCY SINCE THAT EXAMPLE HAS FAILED THEM SO CONSPICUOUSLY THEY ARE NOW RESORTING TO METHODS EXEMPLIFIED BY CRITICISM OF LESSONS ON SOCIAL AFFAIRS SCHOOL LIBRARIES NEW ENGLAND HAS AN ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL LIBRARIANS AT A RECENT MEETING A NUMBER OF PAPERS WERE PRESENTED ALL OF WHICH INDICATE THE GROWTH OF THE MOVEMENT FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES BEFORE REPORTING SOME OF THESE PAPERS IT WILL BE PROPER TO CALL ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT SCHOOLS ARE USING IN EVERINCREASING DEGREE MANY DIFFERENT BOOKS IN THE PREPARATION OF LESSONS RATHER THAN THE SINGLE TEXTBOOK WHICH HAS SO LONG BEEN TRADITIONAL INSTEAD OF READING A SINGLE BOOK ON HISTORY PUPILS ARE BEING SENT TO THE LIBRARY TO READ FROM A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT AUTHORITIES AND TO COMPARE THE STATEMENTS FOUND IN DIFFERENT BOOKS IN SCIENCE THE SAME PRACTICE IS ARISING ENG LISH IS NO LONGER CONFINED TO A FEW CLASSICS CAREFULLY DISSECTED BUT IS AIMING BY LABORATORY METHODS AND INDIVIDUAL CONFERENCES TO INDUCE CHILDREN TO READ WIDELY IN THE LITERATURE OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY AND OF OTHER COUNTRIES THIS CHANGE IN THE METHOD OF ORGANIZING CLASSROOM WORK IMPLIES A NEW TYPE OF EQUIPMENT IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAT EQUIPMENT CONSISTS IN A LIBRARY THE EFFECTIVE USE OF A LIBRARY IN TURN DEPENDS UPON THE PRESENCE OF A LIBRARIAN WHO CAN SYMPATHETICALLY DIRECT THE INTERESTS OF CHILDREN AND CAN GIVE SOME INSTRUCTION IN THE METHODS OF FINDING MATERIAL SCATTERED THROUGH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT VOLUMES ASSOCIATIONS SIMILAR TO THAT ORGANIZED IN NEW ENGLAND OUGHT TO BECOME COMMON IN ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY ANDEDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT 213 PAPERS OF THE TYPE REPORTED FOR THAT ASSOCIATION OUGHT TO BECOME SUFFICIENTLY COMMON TO IMPRESS TEACHERS IN ALL DEPARTMENTS OF THE SCHOOL THE FOLLOWING QUOTATION FROM THE REPORT MADE BY THE SECRETARY GIVES THE DETAILS OF THE PAPERS READ AT THIS MEETING MISS MARTHA CAROLINA PRITCHARD LIBRARIAN OF THE BRIDGEWATER NORMAL SCHOOL PRESIDENT OF THE ASSOCIATION WAS SECOND SPEAKER HER PLEA WAS FOR THE SCHOOL LIBRARY ESPECIALLY AS A FACTOR IN THE AMERICANIZATION OF THE FOREIGN PUPILS IN WHOSE HOMES THERE IS AN UTTER ABSENCE OF BOOKS SHE ALSO EMPHA SIZED THE NEED IN NORMAL SCHOOLS OF TRAINING THE TEACHERS TO GET AT THIS AND O F IMPRESSING UPON THEM WHAT THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES WILL DO FOR THEM IF THEY WILL DO THEIR PART SHE SHOWED A PLAN WORKED OUT AT TEACHERS COLLEGE IN NEW YORK IN A CLASS DURING A SUMMER SESSION FOR EXTENDING LIBRARY INSTRUCTION THROUGH THE GRADES ALLOTTING DEFINITE PHASES OF THE SUBJECT TO THE GRADES CAP ABLE OF GRASPING THEM HER PLEA FOR FAMILIARITY WITH THE WORLD OF BOOKS FOR CHILDREN BROUGHT FORTH COMMENTS FROM MISS NEWTON OF THE BRIDGEWATER NORMAL MR LOWE OF THE MASSACHUSETTS STATE LIBRARY COMMISSION AND MR THURBER AND MR PALMER OF THE NEWTON TECHNICAL HIGH IN WHICH WAS EMPHASIZED THE NEED THAT CHIL DREN BE MADE TO FEEL AT HOME IN A LIBRARY THAT THE LOVE OF BOOKS BE TAUGHT THEM AND THAT FROM THE SCHOOL MANS POINT OF VIEW TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE IN A LIBRARIAN COUNTS LESS THAN LOVE OF BOOKS AND POWER TO LEADA GREAT ENCOURAGE MENT TO THE SCHOOL STRUGGLING TO ORGANIZE LIBRARIES AND AS YET UNABLE TO AFFORD A TRAINED LIBRARIAN THE THIRD SPEAKER WAS THE LIBRARIAN HERSELF MISS GLADYS BIGELOW SHE DESCRIBED THE TYPICAL DAY IN THE LIBRARY DETAILING METHODS AND PICTURING THE LIBRARY ACTIVITIES WITH A VIVIDNESS THAT MADE HER GUESTS LOOKERSON DURING A SCHOOL DAY RATHER THAN SATURDAY MORNING VISITORS THE AFTERNOON PROGRAM OFFERED TWO SPEAKERS A THIRD MISS GRIFFIN OF THE CHILDRENS MUSEUM OF BOSTON JAMAICA PLAINS MADE A WELCOME IM PROMPTU ADDITION SHE DISPLAYED FRENCH WAR POSTERS AND OTHER MATERIAL OF WAR INTEREST WHICH ARE AVAILABLE AS LOANS TO ANY NEW ENGLAND SCHOOL DEFRAY ING TRANSPORTATION EXPENSES MR HENRY SANBORN LIBRARIAN OF THE BRIDGEPORT PUBLIC LIBRARIES WHO HAS RECENTLY RETURNED FROM THE MIDDLE WEST MADE A PLEA FOR PROPER LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE STATE SUPERVISION AND SUPPORT FOR UNIFORM SCHOOL LIBRARIES NOT MERELY IN DESTITUTE DISTRICTS BUT IN PLACES WHERE NEED IS ACUTE THOUGH LESS APPARENT214 THE SCHOOL REVIEW AS SUPERVISOR OF CHILDRENS WORK IN THE BOSTON PUBLIC LIBRARY MISS ALICE JORDAN HAS EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY TO JUDGE THE APPEAL OF BOOKS AND IN HER INFORMAL SUMMARIES AND SELECTED READINGS FROM THE NEW HOLIDAY EDITIONS GAVE A DELIGHTFUL INSIGHT NOT ONLY INTO THE CHARMS OF THE BOOKS BUT INTO THE TASTES OF BOYS AND GIRLS INDUSTRIAL CHEMISTRY THE LITERARY DIGEST CONTAINED IN A RECENT NUMBER AN INTERESTING FULLPAGE EDITORIAL ON THE DEVELOPMENTS OF INDUSTRIAL CHEMISTRY THE SECONDARY SCHOOLS OF EUROPE ESPECIALLY THOSE OF ENGLAND HAVE DEVOTED A GOOD DEAL OF ATTENTION TO INDUSTRIAL CHEMISTRY INDEED THE MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS IN GENERAL THROUGHOUT ENGLAND HAVE BEEN DRIVEN TO COURSES THAT SHOULD BE USEFUL IN A PRACTICAL WAY IN THE TEXTILE AND OTHER RELATED INDUSTRIES AND THEY HAVE DEVELOPED MUCH MORE FULLY THAN OUR AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS SCIENTIFIC COURSES FOR YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE GOING INTO THE INDUSTRIES THE PLEA PUT FORTH BY THE LITERARY DIGEST FOR AN ENLARGEMENT OF COURSES IN INDUSTRIAL CHEMISTRY IN OUR AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOLS IS VIGOROUS AND FORCEFUL IT IS NOT POSSIBLE HERE TO QUOTE THE FULL PAGE WHICH IS THERE GIVEN SOME EXTRACTS WILL HOWEVER SERVE TO INDICATE THE TENOR OF THE DISCUSSION BEFORE THE WAR CHEMISTRY WAS TO THE LAYMAN A DRY UNINTERESTING SUBJECT ONE TO BE AVOIDED BECAUSE HE DID NOT KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT IT TO TALK WITH ANY DEGREE OF CERTAINTY IN FACT WAS THERE ANYTHING TO TALK ABOUT THE TRAN SITION FROM THIS FEELING OF INDIFFERENCE TO ONE OF INTENSE INTEREST TOOK BUT A MATTER OF A FEW MONTHS AND HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE DEVELOP MENTS SINCE THE WAR BUT WHY WAS AMERICA WITH HER TREMENDOUS NATURAL RESOURCES DEPENDENT UPON ANY COUNTRY FOR THESE PRODUCTS SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE WAS NO PUBLIC INTEREST THERE WAS NO INCENTIVE FOR THE YOUNG BLOOD OF THE COUNTRY TO TRAIN THEMSELVES FOR CHEMICAL PURSUITS THE CAPITALISTS DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE TREMENDOUS POSSIBILITIES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL INDUS TRY THE GOVERNMENT DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF AMERICA OWNING AND CONTROLLING ITS OWN CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES IN SHORT THE PEOPLE IN GENERAL DID NOT REALIZE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE ECONOMIC FABRIC OF THE NATION WAS DEPENDENT UPON THE CHEMISTEDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT 215 THE ENTIRE COUNTRY HAD A MOST RUDE AWAKENING WHEN IT LEARNED THAT ITS SUPPLY OF POTASH MEDICINALS OPTICAL GLASSWARE PORCELAIN ETC WAS CUT OFF TO SAY THERE WAS CONSTERNATION WOULD BE TO EXPRESS IT LIGHTLY THE GENERAL PUBLIC BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND THAT SUCH INDUSTRIES AS THE TEXTILE LEATHER AND LITHOGRAPHIC INK WERE SOLELY DEPENDENT UPON DYES AND THAT THESE INDUSTRIES SUPPLIED THE VERY CLOTHES AND SHOES THEY WORE AND THE BOOKS AND PERIODICALS THEY READ FLAMING EDITORIALS WERE WRITTEN CONGRESS WAS SWAMPED WITH BILLS OF ALL KINDS AND DESCRIPTIONS SUGGESTING REMEDIES ALL ATTACKING THE SLOTHFULNESS OF THE AMERICAN CHEMIST IN EVER PERMITTING SUCH A STATE OF AFFAIRS TO EXIST AND WHILE THE LAYMAN ATTACKED THE CHEMIST THE SUDDEN STOPPAGE OF DYES ALMOST CAUSED A PANIC IN MANY TRADES PARTICULARLY THE CLOTHING TRADE MANY PEOPLE WERE LITERALLY THROWN OUT OF EMPLOYMENT OVER NIGHT FOR WHAT WAS THE USE OF WEAVING CLOTH IF THERE WERE NO DYES EVEN OUR COTTON INDUSTRY WAS THROWN INTO JEOPARDY FOR IF THERE WERE NO DYES WHAT WAS THE USE OF RAISING SO MUCH COTTON THE PUBLIC INTEREST FIRST CREATED BY IMMINENT CATASTROPHE FOLLOWED BY THE STIMULATION OF THE WAR FOR ALL THINGS CHEMICAL HAS CHANGED THE PUBLIC VIEWPOINT OF CHEMISTRY FROM INDIFFERENCE TO INTENSE INTEREST BUT NOW THAT THE WAR IS WON WILL THIS INTEREST CONTINUE TO BE MANIFESTED BY THE LAYMAN THIS IS A QUESTION WHICH SHOULD HAVE THE THOUGHT OF EVERY CHEMICAL MAN IN THE COUNTRY DURING THE PAST FOUR YEARS OUR CHEMICAL INDUSTRY HAS LAID BARE VAST OPPORTUNITIES IT HAS MERELY SCRATCHED THE SURFACE ITS FUTURE DEPENDS UPON HARD NEVERCEASING WORK THE EXPANSION OF THE EXISTING POSSI BILITIES AND SYMPATHETIC PUBLIC OPINION THIS SYMPATHETIC PUBLIC OPINION WHICH HAS BEEN STARTED BY PUBLICITY IN THE EDITORIAL PAGES OF NEWSPAPERS AND PERIODICALS MUST BE STRENGTHENED MUST BE SUSTAINED BUT THE GENERAL PUBLIC IS FICKLE AND HAS CHANGES OF HEART FROM ONE DAY TO ANOTHER THEY HAVE BEEN READING SO MUCH ABOUT CHEMICALS AND THE NEW CHEMICAL INDUSTRY THAT THEY ARE ABOUT TO TAKE IT FOR GRANTED AND THEN THEY ARE ON THE WAY TO INDIFFERENCE AND THE INDIFFERENCE OF THE PUBLIC MEANS THE REGRESSION OF THE INDUSTRY ADVERTISING IN THE NEWSPAPERS AND PERIODICALS OF THE COUNTRY WILL PLAY AN IMPORTANT PART TO FOSTER AND INCREASE SYMPATHETIC PUBLIC OPINION TO ENLIST THE INTEREST OF CAPITAL TO PROTECT NEW ADVENTURES TO WIDEN THE PEACE TIME MARKET THE LEADERS OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL INDUSTRY WILL COME OUT OF THE LABORATORY AND OUT OF THE FACTORY AND TALK TO THE THINKING PUBLIC IN THE MAGAZINES AND NEWSPAPERS OF AMERICA2I6 THE SCHOOL REVIEW NEW JERSEY HIGHSCHOOL CONFERENCE CONFERENCES OF HIGHSCHOOL TEACHERS AND PRINCIPALS HAVE FREQUENTLY BEEN HELD IN THE STATE UNIVERSITIES OF THE MIDDLE WEST THE PRACTICE ORIGINATED IN A CONFERENCE CALLED BY PRESI DENT HARPER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO BUT IT HAS SPREAD SO WIDELY THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE STATES THAT IT IS NOW AN ESTAB LISHED INSTITUTION IN MANY OF THE STATES THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNT IS GIVEN

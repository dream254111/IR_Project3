his body it was held that the law of the domicile of the testator determined the nature of the estates created but the law of the domicile of the remainderman controlled in establishing who were the heirs of his body the personalty being within the State of the domicile of the remainderman at his death Penny v Christmas 7 Rob La 481 1844 Also where A domiciled in one State executed a trust deed conveying certain personal property to a trustee with directions to convert into realty and pay the income to B for life then back to A and his heirs at law A dying intestate domiciled in another State from that in which the deed was made it was held that the laws of the first State determined the construction of the instrument but the laws of the settlors last domicile governed who took thereunder Merrill v Preston 135 Mass 451 1883 But the weight of authority seems to be that the persons to take as heirs of the beneficiary after the latters life estate should be determined by the domicile of the testator or settlor Lincoln v Perry 149 Mass 368 21 N E 671 4 L R A 215 1889 Codman v Krell 152 Mass 215 25 N E 90 1890 In Re Devoe 66 App Div 1 72 N Y Supp 962 1901 The reason given for this rule is that the testator is presumed to be more familiar with the laws of his domicile and intended that law to operate Lincoln v Perry supra Apparently no case on this point has ever arisen in Virginia INTOXICATING LIQUORSINTEN T AND GOOD FAITH NOT ELEMENTS OF IL LEGAL SALE OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGESThe defendant a retail dealer pur chased sweet cider from a manufacturer who was manufacturing it in accordance with the regulations of the National Prohibition Act Due to the ineffectiveness of the preservative used by the manufacturer the cider contrary to law contained more than onehalf of one per cent of alcohol The defendant was unaware that it contained more than the lawful percentage of alcohol For selling such cider the defendant was criminally prosecuted and defended on the ground of lack of knowledge and intent Held defendant guilty United States v Mathie 274 Fed 225 1921 There is a rule of the common law of very general application to the effect that there can be no crime when the criminal mind or intent is wanting However in some instances the doing of a prohibited act constitutes a crime irrespective of the moral turpitude or purity of the motive as the case may be or of ignorance or mistake of fact There are certain acts made punishable without proof that the defendant in tended to commit a crime Such acts are known as mala prohibito and among these acts are prosecutions for the unlawful sale of intoxicating liquors Upon considerations of public policy it is deemed best in such cases to require that one must ascertain at his peril whether what he does comes within the legislative prohibition 8 R C L 122 But see contra Stern v State 53 Ga 229 21 Am Rep 266 1874 Farrell v State 32 Ohio St 456 30 Am Rep 614 1877 The offense in such cases consists not in the intention but in the act Commonwealth v Mixer 207 Mass 141 93 N E 249 31 L R A N S 467 20 Ann 216RECENT DECISIONS Cas 1152 1910 Commonwealth v Sacks 214 Mass 72 100 N E 1019 45 L R A N S 1 Ann Cas 1914B 1076 1913 The construction placed on the Volstead Act is that any person who sells cider as a bever age does so at his peril and he must know that the cider contains less than onehalf of one per cent of alcohol by volume United States v Mathie supra The test whether liquor is intoxicating is the character of the liquor and not the good faith of the defendant in making the sale so that evidence that the defendant did not know of the intoxicating character of the liquor is hearsay and incompetent Nies v District Court 179 Iowa 326 161 N W 316 1917 The intoxicating quality of homemade wine is a question of fact for the jury and it is no defense to the seller or purveyor of such wine that he believed it to be nonintoxicat ing State v Dennison 85 W Va 261 101 S E 458 1919 However in a prosecution for the sale of an article of medicinal value but which contains 20 per cent alcohol and is generally used as a beverage because of its intoxicating qualities it need not be proved that accused believed or had reason to believe or suspect that the article thus sold was to be used as a beverage City of Montrose v Price Col 196 Pac 863 1921 Although a statute bases criminal liability upon a union of joint opera tion of act and intention and criminal intention is made a necessary element for a punishment for an offense against the prohibition laws such criminal in tention is simply the intention to commit the act which the law prohibits Mit chell v State 20 Ga App 778 93 S E 709 1917 And where a statute exempts from punishment any person who committed the act or made the omission charged under an ignorance or mistake of fact disproving any criminal intent nevertheless no defense can be made thereunder by a de fendant prosecuted for selling intoxicating liquors that he had no knowledge that the article sold as cider was intoxicating Hill v State 9 Ariz 78 165 Pac 326 1917 A grocer who sells Jamaica ginger and lemon extract under circumstances from which he must know that they are bought to be used as a beverage violates the prohibition law if they in fact contain the prohibited percentage of alcohol State v Johnson 113 S C 350 101 S E 851 1920 In a prosecution for the sale of Jamaica ginger it is for the jury to say under all the circumstances for what purpose the article was being kept and sold State v Higgins Iowa 182 N W 887 1921 Jamaica ginger is held to come within the prohibition against the sale of intoxicating liquors and the defend ants good faith in thinking that he might sell such admixture is no defense as criminal intent or guilty knowledge is not a necessary ele ment of the offense Cooper v State 19 Ariz 486 172 Pac 276 1918 On the other hand there are certain cases holding that where there is an honest mistake of fact as to the intoxicating quality of the article sold a proper instruction on this matter should be given to the jury Mayne v State 48 Tex Cr R 93 86 S W 329 1905 Uloth v State Tex Cr R 87 S W 822 1905 McRoberts v State 49 Tex Cr R 288 92 S W 804 1906 And where a statute expressly permits the keeping for sale of nonintoxicating cider to make the keeping of cider for sale illegal it must in fact be intoxicating and if the defendant 217VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW honestly believes either from the guaranty of the manufacturers or other good and sufficient reasons that the particular cider is nonin toxicating then in a prosecution for an illegal sale the matters of guilty knowledge and intent should be submitted to the jury by way of defense Coury v State Okl 200 Pac 871 1921 A sale of a concoction which the seller believes and has a right to believe is not an intoxicant does not warrant a conviction though the con coction is in fact an intoxicant Walker v State 50 Tex Cr R 495 98 S W 843 1906 Where it is expressly lawful to deliver intoxicating liquors for strictly medicinal or mechanical purposes a common carrier if it acts with reasonable care or due caution to avoid a violation of the statute should not be deemed guilty if the whisky so delivered is not used for the prescribed purposes Wells Fargo  Co Express v State 130 Ark 210 197 S W 13 1917 A hotel porter receiving as baggage of an incoming guest a suit case which he had no right to inspect and which contained intoxicating liquor cannot be held criminally liable unless guilty knowledge or intent be shown under a statute mak ing it unlawful for any person to possess any intoxicating liquor within the State State v Cox 91 Ore 518 179 Pac 575 1919 Under a statute permitting the sale of intoxicating liquors for medicinal pur poses a defendant who has made no attempt to comply with the statute cannot defend upon the ground of his good faith in making the sale for medicinal use in a prosecution for selling intoxicating liquors City of Montrose v Price supra A druggist who in good faith has Jamaica ginger in his possession for sale cannot be held criminally liable for having in his possession intoxicating liquor if such preparation is unfit for use as a beverage and where such prosecution is brought the State must show that the article was dealt in for use as a beverage or in toxicant Schemmtcr v State Neb 180 N W 581 1920 Defendants proprietors of a grocery store who sold in good faith Jamaica ginger containing eightyeight per cent alcohol for flavoring and medicinal purposes did not violate the prohibition law where there was no evi dence that the preparation was being used as a beverage Commonwealth v Sookey Mass 128 N E 788 1920 Turning to the Virginia holdings it is found that the honest belief of a defendant that the beverage which he sold was of a kind which could lawfully be sold without a license was a matter to be urged upon the court after conviction in mitigation of sentence but it was not a defense to a prosecution for selling intoxicating liquors Bracey v Commonwealth 119 Va 867 89 S E 144 1916 As to what is included under the term intoxicating liquors see Acts 1916 p 216 LANDLORD AND TENANTTENANT FROM YEAR TO YEAR BY HOLDING OVER WITH LANDLORDS CONSENT Is NOT ENTITLED TO NOTICE TO QUITThe plaintiff was tenant of a suite of offices under a

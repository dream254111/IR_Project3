the methods of teaching geography in our lower schools The faults nlost frequently mentioned are that the beginnirlg is not made properly that there are too mimy lists of places corn mitted to memory nd that the teachino is too lifeless and is nDt made real enough by illustration and descri tion apart from the text book The first erro can be easily corrected by adopting the German method of instruction where instead of begi nning with the definitions of meridians and pa allels that are so often found misplaced on the opening pages of our textbooks the pupil first study the arrange ment of the schoolroom then of the play ground next the geography of the townl and of the surrounding cauntry and thus learn the meaning of the map from which they after wards study about tie more distant parts of the world But this does not go very far After laying the proper foundation is there any way of learning geography xcept by committing to memory the names lund relative positions of the many mountains rivers capes bays lakes cities and towns thlat give features to the earth Detail may of course be carried too far if a precise know Ledge of distant and to us unimportant countriis be required but for the average scholar of this country who should become well acquaint ed with the geography of North America and Europe there is no easy path no royal road iver the broad rough field of fact that he must cross We fancy there fore that the seconl criticism touches not a fault but a difficulty inherent in the study Names and positions of places must be learned but as books of molerate cost can give very little more than the barest mention of them the study is apt to b3come lifeless and to de generate into the learning of dull words from a dead map unless the teacher averts this unfor tunately common result and enlivens the work by instruction beyond the textbook This V Gj V VOL I No 51 however is more than we have a right to expect from the overworked and underpaid teachers in the lower schools for it is no easy task It demands much reading in many books it requires illustration by numerous maps photographs and diagrams far beyond the reach not only of the teacher but of the school board as well In short the desirable the ideal teaching of even so commonplace a subject as elementary geography is an expen sive art requiring much study high skill and an extensive outfit It is now recognized that the successful teaching of chemistry physics and natural sci ence needs that the teachers of these branches shall know them by practical experimental observational work A fair application of the same principle would require that the teacher of geography should have travelled but how far are we now from so desirable an end  It is safe to say that of all the teachers of our common schools not onequarter have seen an ocean a harbor or a high mountain and not onetwentieth of them have had any personal acquaintance with the foreign countries that they have to describe Under these conditions it is certainly no wonder that the study of ge ography becomes so often a tiresome exercise of unintelligent memory and it cannot be otherwise without a cost that few school boards can allow LETTERS TO THE EDITOR  Correspondents are requested to be as brief as possible The writers nae is in all cases required as proof of good faith Naval officers and the coastsurvey IN your issue of the 1lth you refer editorially to the proposition contained in the report of the secre tary of the navy for 1883 to transfer all national work connected with the ocean and conducted by other departments to the control of the navy depart ment and in a subsequent paragraph you make some criticisms upon the character of the work performed by navy officers in the coastsurvey The question as to whether the navy or the treasury department shall control the work I do not propose to discuss but I must enter my protest against the assertion in a journal like Science which goes forth to the world as authority that the  work which these navy offi cers perform is routine the plans and methods for which have been devised and developed by civiliaa experts and to the assertion contained in the phrase the present method of employing our super fluous navy under the intelligent supervision of 1  IrI 1  iJANUARY 25 1884 SCIE civilian experts To answer these points in order I will say first as a matter of history that the plan of the coastsurvey was compiled over forty years since by a mixed board composed in part of navy officers This plan was legalized by Congress in 184344 and has been mainly in force ever since though some modifications have necessarily been made by the judgment and experience of the emi nent men who have held the offices of superintendent and principal assistants By the plan referred to it was made the legitirmate duty of officers and men of the navy to execute the hydrographic part of the work and to them has ever since been assigned the bulk of that work except during the few years when the civil war and the subsequent scarcity of officers made it impossible to do so That period ie from 1861 to 1871 developed a good many civilian hydrog raphers who have no superiors in the world but nearly all of these resumed their more legitimate work upon the return of navy officers to the survey The methods of hydrography are the growth of hun dreds of years and have been contributed to by the seamen of all maritime nations and while the in ventors of a good many instruments and special methods are known it would be exceedingly difficult to trace the system to its source The  tricks of the trade so to speak have been handed down from one to another with gradual improvement as a rule too slow to give any definite point from which that improvement can be shown though during the forty years of its existence the coastsurvey has vastly im proved the character of its work but probably the improvement in its means ie the introduction of steampropelling power etc deserves a good deal of the credit for improved methods While civilians have had a share in the development it is a long way from the fact to ascribe all to them as it is to assume that hydrography is a work which does not require skill judgment and care Those who think the last have never worked in intricate waters The officers engaged upon the coastsurvey have been so assigned because it was a part of their regular duty and not because  superfluous Having had for five years the privilege of nominating the officers to be employed upon the coastsurvey I can speak with some authori ty Officers were chosen strictly for their qualifica tions and often had it not been for the great interest taken in the coastsurvey by the successive chiefs of the bureau of navigation the officers selected would not have been spared from other duties That all work of the coastsurvey is supervised by the super intendent an expert of high order is an undoubted fact but his instructions to hydrographers unless he has some special object in view simply assign geo graphical liinits but do not prescribe methods a general printed manual covering all that is required in the latter The work aftei completion has of course to pass the rigid scrutiny of the superintend ent but the same is the case with all otherwork To this extent the work of navy officers may be said to be  supervised by civilian experts but no farther In 1873 several navy officers who without previous experience were ordered to the coastsurvey placed themselves for a short time under the instructions of civil assistants who had been doing their work for some years and all of them freely and gratefully ac knowledge the assistance they received I am free to acknowledge obligations of a similar character of many a point received from my valued civil associates during the Darien Canal expedition of 1870 Nauti cal surveying has always been taught theoretically at the Naval academy and as much practice as possible has generally though not always been given Fur NCE 87 thermore nautical surveying and navigation are very near cousins so that all the instruction needed to make a navigator a surveyor is to give him what I have called the tricks of the trade and these are being handed down by officers as they have been by their predecessors EDWARD P LULL Captain US navy late hydrographic inspector US coast geodetic survey The plan of organization of the coastsurvey and the plan of work of the survey are quite different things It is the duty of the chief of the survey to arrange and supervise the latter That the scope and character have been extended since its organization in accordance with the views of the chief is beyond question While from the above letter it might be inferred that the nautical work of the coastsurvey is confined to marine surveying in its older sense of locating rocks and shoals and determining the boundaries of courses of the navigable waters by timehonored methods yet from the publications of the coastsurvey and from other sources we had gathered that the study of ocean physics and of the conformation and character of the ocean bottom together with the different forms of marine life had formed of recent years an important part of the work of the survey and that it was carried out in accordance with the plans of the chiefs of the survey and by the methods devised and developed by them and by the two Agassizs Pourtales Thompson MilneEdwards and many other eminent specialists modified in minor details by the circumstances of each case It is an error to suppose we regard the employ ment of naval officers in this work unfavorably for on the contrary we think it highly desirable that they should be employed in this routine work of col lecting data and material for discussion and study by specialists and their skill judgment and care their knowledge of organization and discipline and their close adherence to instructions render them ex tremely useful It is wise also that in the present reduced condition of the navy as to ships and its overcrowded condition as to officers the secretary should find employment for this superfluity in the coastsurvey the fishcommission the geological survey the national museum as instructors in our colleges and as assistants in special researches Such employment cannot but result in benefit to the navy and assist in the advancement of science Yet we have still to be persuaded that it will pro mote the efficiency or the economy of the scientific organizations of the government if they are trans ferred from the supervision of the present expert civilian heads to that of the officers of the navy Italics for scientific names I agree with the editorial remarks under this head ing in Science No 49 that the proper mission of italics is for emphasis or as catchwords  and their use for scientific names of animals and plants is it seems to me  contrary to the opinion conveyed editorially  of great practical utility especially in indexing or in searching the pages of an article or memoir for references to particular species that may be under treatment Italicizing such words makes them catchwords and gives great facility in dis covering incidental reference to species the eye quickly catching the italicized name and as quickly recognizing whether it is the one sought Consider ing scientific names as a simple convenience and as having no higher value their use is so necessary as

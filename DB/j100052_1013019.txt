J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1013019,AMERICAS POSSIBLE CONTRIBUTION TO A CONSTRUCTIVE PEACE,I242646,AMERICAS POSSIBLE CONTRIBUTION TO A CONSTRUCTIVE PEACE BY MORRIS HILLQUIT NEW YORK THE TIME HAS PASSED WHEN TWO OR MORE GREAT NATIONS COULD WAGE WAR WITHOUT INVOLVING THE REST OF THE WORLD TODAY THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANISM OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION IS SO DELICATELY ATTUNED THAT THE SLIGHTEST DISTURBANCE IN ANY OF ITS PARTS IMMEDIATELY COM MUNICATES ITSELF TO THE WHOLE BODY THE UNITED STATES CAN NO MORE BE INDIFFERENT TO THE FRIGHTFUL RAVAGES OF THE EUROPEAN CATACLYSM THAN THE BRAIN OF A MAN CAN BE INDIFFERENT TO AN ACUTE DISORDER OF HIS HEART WE ARE UNITED WITH THE LEADING COUNTRIES OF EUROPE BY INTIMATE AND VITAL TIES EVERY ECONOMIC OR SOCIAL IMPROVEMENT EVERY SCIENTIFIC OR SPIRITUAL ADVANCE AND EVERY PROGRESS OF THE ARTS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OCEAN RAISES OUR STANDARDS OF THINKING FEELING AND LIVING AND EVERY RETROGRESSION IN THESE FIELDS OF HUMAN ENDEAVOR CHECKS OUR OWN PROGRESS DETERIO RATES OUR OWN WORTH THE WAR WHICH IS FOUGHT ON BATTLEFIELDS MORE THAN THREE THOU SAND MILES REMOVED FROM US IS DISARRANGING THE ENTIRE SOCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL FABRIC OF THIS COUNTRY WE ARE INVOLUNTARILY DRAWN INTO THE MAELSTROM OF THE WAR IN EVERYTHING BUT THE PHYSICAL FIGHTING I HOLD THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS VITAL INTERESTS AND IMPERATIVE DUTIES IN THIS WAR AND SHOULD EXERT EVERY ATOM OF POWER TO BRING ABOUT A SPEEDY AND LASTING PEACE BETWEEN THE NATIONS HOW CAN THIS GREAT TASK BE ACCOMPLISHED THERE ARE THREE MAIN CHANNELS THROUGH WHICH MODERN COUNTRIES INTERACT ON EACH OTHERPOLITICAL ECONOMIC AND SPIRITUAL IF THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES HAVE THE POWER TO INFLUENCE THE BELLIG ERENT NATIONS IN FAVOR OF A CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES SUCH POWER MUST BE FOUND IN ONE OR MORE OF THESE CHANNELS AND I MAINTAIN THAT WE MAY EXERCISE A DECISIVE INFLUENCE ON THE DESTINIES OF THE WORLDWAR IN ALL THREE DIRECTIONS POLITICALLY THE NATIONS ARE ALMOST EQUALLY DIVIDED INTO BELLIGER ENTS AND NONCOMBATANTS ONEHALF OF THE WORLD IS UNDER ARMS 239THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY STRIVING FOR MUTUAL EXTERMINATION WHILE THE OTHER HALF WITNESSES THE INHUMAN SPECTACLE WITH IMPOTENT DISMAY IF ALL THE NATIONS AT PEACE ALL AMERICAN REPUBLICS AND ALL NEU TRAL POWERS OF EUROPE AND ASIA WOULD JOIN IN A DEFINITE AND URGENT OFFER OF MEDIATION THE PROPOSAL WOULD COME WITH SUCH COMMANDING MORAL FORCE THAT IT COULD NOT BE LONG IGNORED BY THE BELLIGERENT POWERS EVERY NEUTRAL COUNTRY IS DEEPLY AND DISASTROUSLY AFFECTED BY THE WAR AND WISHES TO SEE PEACE BUT THE WORLD IS INERT AND INACTIVE FOR LACK OF LEADERSHIP IT IS THIS LEADERSHIP WHICH WE MUST ASSUME THE UNITED STATES IS THE LARGEST MOST POWERFUL AND INFLUENTIAL OF THE NEUTRAL NATIONS IT IS ALSO THE MOST INDEPENDENT AND SECURE IT IS NATURALLY PLACED IN A POSITION OF LEADERSHIP IN THIS WORLDCRISIS OUR GOVERNMENT COULD PROPERLY TAKE IT UPON ITSELF TO ORGANIZE A COUNCIL OF ALL NEUTRAL NATIONS A MODERN INTERNATIONAL CONCERT OF POWERS TO CONCILIATE THE WARRING NATIONS AND NOT TO RELAX IN EFFORTS UNTIL PEACE IS FINALLY AND FIRMLY ESTABLISHED THIS MAY BE A RATHER UNCONVENTIONAL STEP IN ESTABLISHED DIPLO MATIC PROCEDURE BUT THE WORLD HAS NEVER FACED A CRISIS AS GREAT AS THAT THROUGH WHICH WE ARE NOW PASSING THE EXTRAORDINARY SITUA TION CALLS FOR UNUSUAL METHODS BOLD MEASURES AND BIG MEN ECONOMICALLY WE HAVE IT WITHIN OUR POWER TO MINIMIZE THE FEROCITY OF THE EUROPEAN SLAUGHTER AND PERHAPS TO SHORTEN ITS DURA TION BY CUTTING OFF OUR SUPPLY OF ARMS WAR EQUIPMENTS AMMUNITION AND CREDITS FROM ALL BELLIGERENT COUNTRIES IT IS BARBAROUS ENOUGH TO SET THE ENGINES OF INDUSTRY TO WORK MANUFACTURING INSTRUMENTS FOR THE ASSASSINATION OF AN ENEMY BUT IT IS CRIMINALLY CULPABLE TO PRODUCE SUCH WEAPONS FOR THE KILLING OF PEOPLE WITH WHOM OUR COUN TRY IS SUPPOSED TO BE AT PEACE BY FURNISHING ARMS TO THE BELLIGER ENTS WE TAKE AN ACTIVE PART IN THE DIRECT HOSTILITIES AND OUR PART IN IT IS ALL THE MORE HIDEOUS AND REVOLTING BECAUSE IT IS A COLDBLOODED TRAFFIC FOR PROFIT IT IS URGED THAT IF WE REFUSED TO EXPORT ARMS AND AMMUNITIONS IT WOULD AID GERMANY AS AGAINST THE ALLIES AND RESULT IN INCREASING MILITARISM IN EUROPE BECAUSE EACH COUNTRY WOULD BE FORCED TO INCREASE ITS PRODUCTION OF MILITARY SUPPLIES IN TIMES OF PEACE THESE ARGUMENTS BEAR ON THEIR FACE THE TRADEMARK OF THE ARMORPLATE WORKS AND ARE AS FULL OF HOLES AS THE MAIN PRODUCTS OF THESE WORKS THE FACT IS THAT OUR BROADMINDED MANUFACTURERS OF WAR SUPPLIES SELL INDISCRIMINATELY TO BOTH SIDES AND THE CHANCES ARE 240AMERICA AND A CONSTRUCTIVE PEACE THAT WARS WOULD BE RARER AND MILDER IF EACH COUNTRY HAD TO DEPEND ON ITS OWN RESOURCES FOR WAGING WARFARE MORALLY WE MAY INFLUENCE THE COURSE OF THE EUROPEAN WAR BY OUR GENERAL ATTITUDE OUR PEOPLE AND PARTICULARLY OUR PRESS ARE TOO MUCH INCLINED TO VIEW THE APPALLING TRAGEDY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC IN THE LIGHT OF A SPORT WE FOLLOW THE MOVES OF THE HOSTILE ARMIES WITH AN INTEREST AKIN TO THAT WHICH WE FEEL TOWARDS A FASCINATING CHESS PLAY OR AN EXCITING BALL GAME WE PICK THE WIN NER WE TAKE SIDES IN THE PEOPLE OF THE BELLIGERENT COUNTRIES SUCH AN ATTITUDE IS EXCUSABLE WAR IS A PATHOLOGICAL STATE AND CREATES A MORBID PSYCHOLOGY BUT WE HAVE NO SUCH EXCUSE OUR PRESS OUR PULPIT AND OUR LECTURE PLATFORMS SHOULD RESOUND WITH EMPHATIC PROTESTS AGAINST THE WHOLESALE CARNAGE AND WITH CONSISTENT AND PER SISTENT COUNCILS OF PEACE OUR VIEWS AND SENTIMENTS ARE INSTANTLY COMMUNICATED BY THE ELECTRIC SPARK TO THE ENTIRE WORLD WE SPEAK DAILY TO THE PEOPLE OF EUROPELET US SPEAK TO THEM OF THE HORRORS OF THEIR WAR AND OF THE BLESSINGS OF PEACE AND EVENTUALLY THEY MUST HEAR US BUT THERE IS ANOTHER AND GREATER MORAL SERVICE WHICH WE MAY RENDER TO OUR UNFORTUNATE FELLOWMEN IN EUROPETHE SERVICE OF EXAMPLE THIS WAR WILL END SOME DAY WHETHER PEACE WILL COME SOONER THROUGH NEUTRAL INFLUENCES OR WHETHER IT WILL COME LATER AS THE RESULT OF THE PHYSICAL EXHAUSTION OF THE COMBATANTS COME IT MUST SOME TIME AND WHEN THIS GREATEST OF ALL WARS IN HISTORY WILL BE OVER THE WORLD WILL HAVE ITS GREATEST OPPORTUNITY FOR LAYING THE FOUNDATIONS OF ETERNAL PEACE OF A CIVILIZATION WORTHY OF THE NAME THIS WAR IS BOUND TO HAVE A GREAT SOBERING EFFECT UPON MANKIND IT HAS ROBBED WARFARE OF ITS ROMANTIC HALO AND HAS REVEALED IT IN ALL ITS UGLY AND BRUTAL NAKEDNESSA MUTUAL BUTCHERY BY FACTORY METHODS A GEN ERAL CARNAGE ON LAND WATER AND IN THE AIR A PROSTITUTION OF ALL THE SCIENCES AND ARTS TO THE TASK OF DESTROYING HUMAN LIFE IT HAS DEMONSTRATED THE RUINOUS CHARACTER OF THE POLICY OF IMPERIALISM AND THE DANGEROUS FALLACY OF MILITARISM WHEN THE SMOKE OF THE BATTLE WILL BE CLEARED AND THE MASSES NOW IN THE WAR WILL CAST THEIR EYES AROUND THEM THEY WILL ENCOUNTER NOTHING BUT RUIN AND DEVASTATION NOTHING BUT EVIDENCES OF MADNESS SAVAGERY AND SHAME THE TOTAL AND FATAL COLLAPSE OF A FALSE CIVILIZA TION BASED ON THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE JUNGLE ON THE RULE OF THE CLAW 241242 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY AND THE FANG THEY WILL FIND BUT LITTLE COMFORT LITTLE PROMISE IN OLD EUROPE THEY WILL TURN TO US THE GREAT DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC IN THE NEW WORLD WHICH ALONE OF ALL GREAT WORLDPOWERS HAS MANAGED TO PRESERVE SANITY AND PEACE WHAT SHALL WE OFFER THEM SHALL IT BE THE OLD DESTRUCTIVE GOSPEL OF ARMAMENT PREPAREDNESS AND MILI TARISM OR SHALL IT BE A MESSAGE OF PEACE A PROMISE OF A BETTER SANER CIVILIZATION BY OUR OWN EXAMPLE OF PEACE AND GOODWILL WE MAY HELP TO USHER IN AN ERA OF BROTHERHOOD INTO THE HISTORY OF THE HUMAN RACE THIS IS THE SIGNAL OPPORTUNITY THAT THE GREAT WORLDCRISIS OFFERS US LET US NOT FAIL

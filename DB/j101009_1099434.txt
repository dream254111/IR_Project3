CONSIDER ON DEMURRER THE CASE MADE BY THE DECLARATION AS SUPPLE MENTED BY THE BILL OF PARTICULARS CONSIDERING THE CASE THULS MADE WE ARE OF OPINION THAT THE DEFEND ANT IN ERROR CANNOT RELY UPON THE CASE OF KING V N  W RY CO 90 VA 210 AS AN ADJUDICATION OF ALL THE QUESTIONS RAISED IN THIS LITI GATION THE SCOPE OF THAT DECISION WAS TO CONSTRUE THE DEEDS OF 1848 AND 1852 AND THE RIGHTS OF THE GRANTOR AND GRANTEE THEREUNDER IRRE SPECTIVE OF ANY ALLEGATION OF A BREACH BY THE GRANTEE OF THE CONDITIONS OF THE DEEDS SEE PAGES 215 AND 217 OF THE COURTS OPINION THE GRAVAMEN OF THE COMPLAINT IN THIS CASE IS THE ALLEGED BREACHES OF CONDITIONS IN THE DEEDS WHICH IT IS INSISTED ENTITLE THE PLAINTIFF IN ERROR TO AN ABSOLUTE RECOVERY OF ALL THE PREMISES IT APPEARS FROM THE BILL OF PARTICULARS THAT ABOUT FIFTY YEARS AGO BY TWO SEPARATE DEEDS JAMES KING SR THROUGH WHOM THE PLAINTIFF IN1901 KING V N  W RY CO 405 ERROR CLAIMS TITLE CONVEYED TO THE VIRGINIA AND TENNESSEE RAILROAD COMPANY THE PREDECESSOR IN TITLE OF THE DEFENDANT IN ERROR THE LANDS NOW IN CONTROVERSY FOR RAILROAD PURPOSES THE TWO DEEDS REFERRED TO ARE DATED RESPECTIVELY JUNE 1848 AND JUNE 1852 AND THE LANGUAGE MATERIAL TO THE PRESENT CONSIDERATION IS AS FOLLOWS FIRST DEED  PROVIDED HOWEVER THAT THE SAID COMPANY SHALL HAVE NO POWER TO SELL OR CONVEY SAID LAND TO ANY OTHER PERSON NOR SHALL THE SAID COMPANY HAVE THE RIGHT TO USE ANY PORTION OF SAID LAND FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSES THAN THOSE STRICTLY CONNECTED WITH THE BUSINESS OF THE ROAD NOR SHALL SAID COMPANY HAVE THE RIGHT TO ERECT ANY BUILDINGS ON SAID LAND DESIGNED FOR RESIDENCE FOR THE AGENTS OR SERVANTS OF THE COMPANY OR FOR ANY OTHER PERSON SECOND DEED  PROVIDED HOWEVER THAT THE SAID COMPANY SHALL HAVE NO POWER TO SELL AND CONVEY SAID LAND OR ANY PORTION OF IT TO ANY OTHER PERSON WHATSOEVER NOR SHALL THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO USE ANY POR TION OF SAID LAND FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSES THAN THOSE STRICTLY CONNECTED WITH THE BUSINESS OF THE ROAD THE CONTENTION OF THE PLAINTIFF IN ERROR IS THAT THESE PROVISIONS TAKEN TOGETHER CONSTITUTE CONDITIONS SUBSEQUENT THE NONFULFILLMENT OF WHICH RESULTS IN A FORFEITURE OF THE ESTATE GIVING THE GRANTOR THE RIGHT TO RE ENTER AND POSSESS HIMSELF OF HIS FORMER ESTATE AND THAT THIS RIGHT HAS PASSED TO THE PLAINTIFF IN ERROR AS ALIENEE OF THE ORIGINAL GRANTOR CONDITIONS SUBSEQUENT ARE NOT FAVORED IN LAW BECAUSE THEY TEND TO DESTROY ESTATES WHEN RELIED UPON TO WORK A FORFEITURE THEY MUST BE CREATED BY EXPRESS TERMS OR CLEAR IMPLICATION AND ARE STRICTLY CON STRUED IF IT BE DOUBTFUL WHETHER A CLAUSE IN A DEED BE A COVENANT OR A CONDITION THE COURTS WILL INCLINE AGAINST THE LATTER AND ADOPT THE MORE BENIGNANT CONSTRUCTION UPHOLDING THE INSTRUMENT AND LEAVING THE PARTIES TO PURSUE THEIR APPROPRIATE REMEDIES FOR THE BREACH OF COVENANT 4 KENTS COM PP 12930 WE ARE OF OPINION THAT THE LANGUAGE EMPLOYED IN THE DEEDS UNDER CONSIDERATION IS APT LANGUAGE TO CREATE A FEE SIMPLE AND THAT THE SUPER ADDED WORDS UNDER THE AUTHORITIES AMOUNT TO COVENANTS RATHER THAN CONDITIONS THE DEEDS ARE NOT VOLUNTARY AS CONTENDED BUT ARE BASED UPON THE BENEFITS TO ACCRUE TO THE RESERVED PROPERTY OF THE GRANTOR BY REASON OF THE USE OF THE GRANTED PREMISES AS A RAILROAD TERMINAL HENCE THEY MUST BE INTERPRETED AS ANY OTHER DEEDS BASED UPON A VALUABLE CONSIDERATION THE LANGUAGE IS TO BE TAKEN MOST STRONGLY AGAINST THE GRANTOR AND MOST FAVORABLY TO THE GRANTEE THE STIPULATION AGAINST ALIENATION DOES NOT AS CONTENDED CONSTITUTE406 7 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER OCT THE ESTATE GRANTED A FEE QUALIFIED OR BASE FEE SUCH AN ESTATE IS ONE THAT MAY BY ITS LIMITATION CONTINUE FOREVER BUT HAS A QUALIFICATION ANNEXED IN PURSUANCE OF WHICH IT MAY BE DETERMINED AT ANY MOMENT 2 MIN INST 77 THE LAW FAVORS THE FREE ALIENATION JAND TRANSFER OF PROPERTY AND IT IS NOT A STRAINED CONSTRUCTION TO HOLD THAT AN ALIENATION BY ONE RAILROAD COMPANY TO ANOTHER FOR THE PURPOSES ORIGINALLY CONTEMPLATED BY THE GRANTOR WOULD NOT VIOLATE THE SPIRIT OF THE INSTRUMENT THE QUESTION THAT SUCH AN ALIENATION DOES NOT WORK A FORFEITURE IN THIS CASE HAS BEEN ADJUDICATED BY THE FORMER DECISION OF KING V N  W RY CO 90 VA FOR THAT SUIT WAS BY THE PREDECESSOR IN TITLE TO THE PRESENT PLAIN TIFF AND AGAINST AN ALIENEE OF THE ORIGINAL GRANTEE THE INTENTION OF THE PARTIES TO THE INSTRUMENT IS OF CONTROLLING EFFI CACY 4 KENTS CORM 132 IN ASCERTAINING THE INTENTION OF JAMES KING SR IT IS TO BE OBSERVED THAT NEITHER DEED CONTAINS A CLAUSE OF REENTRY WHILE THE PRESENCE OF A CLAUSE OF REENTRY IS NOT ESSENTIAL TO THE CREATION OF A CONDITION SUBSEQUENT THE ABSENCE OF SUCH A CLAUSE IN CONNECTION WITH OTHER CIRCUMSTANICES TENDS TO SUSTAIN THE CONSTRUC TION THAT A COVENANT RATHER THAN A CONDITION WAS INTENDED THERE BEING NO CLAUSE OF REENTRY WE ARE LEFT UNTRAIMIMELLED TO ASCERTAIN THE INTENTION OF THE PARTIES IN THE LIGHT OF ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUND ING THEM AT THE DATE OF THE EXECUTION OF THE DEEDS AS DISCLOSED BY THE DEEDS THEMSELVES AND BY THE FACTS SET FORTH IN THE BILL OF PARTICULARS LN THE LIGHT OF THESE SOURCES OF INFORMATION AND OF THE AUTHORITIES WE ARE OF OPINION THAT BY THE DEEDS IN QUESTION JAMES KING SR INTENDED WITHOUT THOUGHT OF A POSSIBLE REVERTER TO HIMSELF TO ESTABLISH UPON THE LAND GRANTED A RAILROAD TERMINAL THE PRIME OBJECT BEING TO ENHANCE THE VALUE OF HIS REMAINING LANDS LYING ADJACENT TO THOSE GRANTED THAT THE PARTIES DID NOT PROPOSE BY THE LANGUAGE OF THE DEEDS TO CREATE TECHNICAL CONDITIONS A BREACH OF WHICH WOULD WORK A FORFEITURE OF THE ESTATE BUT ONLY INTENDED TO CREATE SUCH RESTRICTIONS AS WERE THOUGHT NECESSARY TO REGULATE AND TO SECURE THEIR PERMANENT OCCU PANCV STRICTLY FOR RAILROAD PURPOSES IN THIS CONNECTION IT MAY BE REMARKED THAT THE USES TO WHICH THE PROPERTY HAS BEEN PUT AS SET OUT IN THE BILL OF PARTICULARS APPEAR TO BE ALL CONNECTED WITH THE BUSINESS OF THE DEFENDANT COMPANY THE FACT THAT IN THE ORIGINAL LITIGATION THE PLAINTIFF DID NOT RELY UPON THE ALLEGED GROUNDS OF FORFEITURE THEN EXISTING WHICH ARE NOW INSISTED UPON IS SIGNIFICANT IN THAT IT SHOWVS THE CONSTRUCTION PLACED BY THE PARTIES UPON THE DEEDS AT THAT TIME AND SUCH CONSTRUCTION IS ENTITLED1901 KING V N  W RY CO 407 TO WEIGHT WHEN THE LANGUAGE EMPLOYED IS AMBIGUOUS AND THE INTENTION OF THE PARTIES IS THE SUBJECT OF INQUIRY THE CONCLUSION BEING THAT COVENANTS AND NOT CONDITIONS WERE CONTEMPLATED IT FOLLOWS THAT THE DEMURRER WAS PROPERLY SUSTAINED AS EJECTMENT DOES NOT LIE FOR THE BREACH OF A COVENANT UNDER PARAGRAPH SEVEN OF THE BILL OF PARTICULARS IT IS CLAIMED THAT PORTIONS OF THE LAND IN QUESTION ARE NOT NOW AND NEVER HAVE BEEN USED BY THE DEFENDANT RAILROAD COMPANY AND THAT THE PLAINTIFF IS ENTI TLED TO THEIR POSSESSION UNDER THE DEEDS AS CONSTRUED BY THIS COURT IN ITS FORMER DECISION AND HAS THE RIGHT TO RECOVER SUCH UNUSED PORTIONS IN THIS ACTION IN THE FORMER CASE THE DEEDS IN QUESTION WHICH ARE MADE PART OF THE BILL OF PARTICULARS WERE CONSTRUED AND THE RIGHTS OF THE PARTIES THEREUNDER CLEARLY DEFINED AND SETTLED PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO THE RIGHT OF THE GRANTOR TO THE USE OF THAT PORTION OF THE LAND NOT USED BY THE DEFENDANT COMPANY THE COURT HOLDING THAT  THE DEEDS IN QUESTION WERE VALID CONVEYANCES AND SHOULD BE CONSTRUED TOGETHER THAT THEY INVEST THE GRANTEE WITH A FEE SIMPLE TITLE TO THE LAND OF THE GRANTOR COVERED OR EMNBRACED BY THEM OR EITHER OF THEM SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS AND RESERVATIONS    THAT UNDER THE RESERVATION IN THE DEED OF THE GRANTOR TO USE ANY PORTION OF THE LAND NOT REQUIRED BY THE RAILROAD COMPANY FOR ITS PURPOSES YIELDING POSSESSION THEREOF WHENEVER REQUIRED OR NEEDED FOR THE PURPOSES OF SAID COMPANY THE GRANTOR OR THOSE CLAIMING UNDER HIM HAVE NO RIGHT TO MAKE ANY PERMANENT CHANGES IN THE PROPERTY BUT MERELY TO USE IT IN THE CONDITION IN WHICH IT IS TO CULTIVATE AND TAKE FROM IT SUCH PRO DUCTS AS IT MAY YIELD AND FOR THAT PURPOSE HE MAY ENCLOSE THE PART SO CULTIVATED PROVIDED THAT THE PART SO CULTIVATED IS NOT NEEDED BY THE RAILROAD COMPANY FOR ANY OF ITS PURPOSES AND PROVIDED FURTHER THAT NO ENCLOSURE SHALL INTERFERE WITH THE RIGHTS OF THE RAILROAD COMPANY IN THE USE OF THE REMAINDER OF THE LAND CONVEYED BUT THE GRANTOR HAS NO RIGHT TO PLACE ANY OF SAID LAND IN SUCH A CONDITION THAT HE CANNOT YIELD IT UP IN THE CONDITION IN WHICH HE RECEIVED IT WHEN IT IS NEEDED FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE RAILROAD COMPANY    IT WAS THE INTENTION AND LEGAL OPERATION OF THE DEED TO GRANT AND TO ACQUIRE RESPECTIVELY LAND TO BE SUBSEQUENTLY USED AS THE NEEDS AND ENTERPRISE OF THE GRANTEE SHOULD DEVELOP THE GRANTORS USE IS BY THE EXPRESS TERMS OF THE DEEDS SUBJECT AT ANY AND ALL TIMES TO THE RIGHT OF THE GRANTEE TO TAKE POSSESSION WHENEVER THE LANDS SHOULD BE NEEDED BY THE COMPANY KING V N  W RY CO 90 VA

USE OF THAT PORTION OF THE LAND NOT REQUIRED BY THE DEFENDANT COMPANY FOR ITS PURPOSES UNDER THE CONSTRUCTION PUT UPON THE DEEDS BY THE FORMER DECISION THE PLAINTIFF IN ERROR COULD ONLY ASSERT A RIGHT TO THE MERE USE OF THE UNEMPLOYED LANDS AND THAT FOR AN UNCERTAIN AND INDETERMINATE PERIOD ONLY UNTIL THE SAME MIGHT BE REQUIRED BY THE DEFENDANT FOR ITS PURPOSES AN INDEFINITE TIME WHICH COULD NOT BE STATED IN ADVANCE SECTION 2730 OF THE CODE PROVIDES THAT  THE PLAINTIFF SHALL STATE I E IN HIS DECLARATION WHETHER HE CLAIMS IN FEE OR FOR LIFE OR THE LIFE OF ANOTHER OR FOR YEARS SPECIFYING SUCH LIVES OR THE DURATION OF SUCH TERM AND WHEN HE CLAIMS AN UNDIVIDED SHARE OR INTEREST HE SHALL STATE THE SAME SECTION 2748 FOLLOWING THE LANGUAGE OF 2730 PROVIDES THAT  THE VERDICT SHALL ALSO SPECIFY THE ESTATE FOUND IN THE PLAINTIFF WHETHER IT BE IN FEE OR FOR LIFE STATING FOR WHOSE LIFE OR WHETHER IT BE A TERM OF YEARS AND SPECIFYING THE DURATION OF SUCH TERM THE PLAINTIFF IN ERROR DOES NOT ASSERT TITLE TO AND UNDER THE DEEDS AS HERETOFORE CONSTRUED CANNOT ASSERT TITLE TO ANY SUCH ESTATE AS IS CON TEMPLATED BY THESE SECTIONS AND THEREFORE CANNOT MAINTAIN EJECTMENT TO RECOVER THE RIGHT TO THE USE OF THE LAND IN QUESTION UPON THE WHOLE CASE THE JUDGMENT MUST BE AFFIRMED AFFIRMED NOTETECHNICAL DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN CONDITIONS AND COVENANTS IN CONVEY ANCES OF REAL ESTATE ARE OFTEN EXTREMELY NICE SUCH DISTINCTIONS ARE GENERALLY OF VITAL IMPORTANCE SINCE A RNERE BREACH OF COVENANT PRODUCES NO FORFEITURE BUT EN TITLES THE GRANTOR TO AN ACTION FOR DAMAGES ONLY WHILE BREACH OF CONDITION GIVES A RIGHT OF REENTRY WITH A FORFEITURE OF THE ESTATE TO THE GRANTOR THE RULING OF THE COURT IN THE PRINCIPAL CASE THAT THE PROVISOS IN THE CONVEY ANCES IN QUESTION WERE COVENANTS RATHER THAN CONDITIONS SEEMS BEYOND CRITICISM THERE IS BUT LITTLE AUTHORITY CITED IN THE OPINION BUT THE BOOKS ABOUND IN CASES INVOLVING THE NUMEROUS HAIRSPLITTING DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN COVENANTS AND CONDI

ALIENATION HAD NOT THE GRANTEE BEEN A CORPORATION SEE 2 MINORS INST 4TH ED  288289 THE CONCLUSION REACHED BY THE COURT THAT THE ACTION OF EJECTNMENT DOES NOT LIE TO RECOVER AN ESTATE SUCH AS THAT CLAIMED IN THE SEVENTH CLAUSE OF THE BILL OF PAR1901 VIRGINIACAROLINA RY CO V BOOKER 409 TICULARSTHE USE OF THE PROPERTY UNTIL THE RAILROAD COMPANY SHOULD NEED IT FOR ITS PURPOSES SEEMS RATHER TOO LITERAL A CONSTRUCTION OF THE STATUTE CITED TO SUSTAIN IT IT IS SCARCELY PROBABLE THAT BY PROVIDING THAT THE PLAINTIFF IN EJECTMENT SHALL STATE  WHETHER HE CLAIMS IN FEE OR FOR LIFE OR THE LIFE OF ANOTHER OR FOR YEARS SPECIFY ING SUCH LIVES OR THE DURATION OF SUCH TERM  SEC 2730 THE STATUTE MEANT TO DENY THE REMEDY OF EJECTMENT TO A PLAINTIFF WHOSE ESTATE WAS NOT A FEE OR FOR LIFE OR FOR YEARS THE MORE REASONABLE INTERPRETATION WOULD SEEM TO BE AND THE REASON RATHER THAN THE LETTER SHOULD GOVERN THAT THE STATUTE MEANS IN SUBSTANCE THAT THE PLAINTIFF SHALL DESCRIBE THE CHARACTER OF THE ESTATE WHICH HE CLAIMSAND THE MENTION OF THE ESTATE IN FEE FOR LIFE ETC WAS INTENDED RATHER AS ILLUSTRATINIG THE NATURE OF THE DESCRIPTION CALLED FOR BY THE STATUTE THIS SEEMS BORNE OUT BY THE SUCCEEDING SECTION 2743 WHICLH PROVIDES THAT THE VERDICT SHALL ALSO SPECIFY THE ESTATEFOUND IN THE PLAINTIF WHETHER IT BE IN FEE OR FOR LIFE ETC AND SPECIFYING THE DURATION OF SUCH TERM THE SUBSTANCE OF THIS IS THAT T HE VERDICT SHALL SPECIFY THE ESTATE FOUND IN THE PLAINTIFFAND WHAT FOLLOWS APPEARS TO BE ILLUSTRATIVE RATHER THAN EXHAUSTIVE OR EXCLUSIVE BESIDES IT IS BY NO MEANS CERTAIN THAT THE PLAINTIFF DID NOT IN THIS CASE CLAIM A BASE FEEAND THE STATUTE IS NOT CONFINED TO FEES SIMPLE BUT IS APPLICABLE TO FEES OF EVERY KIND INCLUDING THEREFORE THE BASE FEE THE COURT IN THIS SAME OPINION DEFINES A BASE FEE AS  ONE THAT MAY BY ITS LIMITATION CONTINUE FOREVER BUT HAS A QUALIFICATION ANNEXED IN PURSUANCE OF WHICH IT MAY BE DETERMINED AT ANY MOMENT HERE THE PLAINTIFF CLAIMED AN ESTATE IN THE PROP ERTY MENTIONED IN THE SEVENTH CLAUSE TO LAST UNTIL THE RAILROAD COMPANY NEEDED THE SAMEFOR ITS PURPOSES THIS ESTATE MIGHT LAST FOREVER AS THE COMPANY MIGHT NEVER NEED IT BUT IT MIGHT COME TO AN END AT ANY MOMENT IF EJECTMENT DOES NOT LIE IN SUCH CASE AS HELD THE REMEDY OF THE PLAINTIFF WOULD BE THE UNSATISFACTORY ONE OF UNLAWFUL DETAINEROR POSSIBLY BY REASON OF THE IN ADEQUACY OF THE LEGAL REMEDY A SUIT IN EQUITY

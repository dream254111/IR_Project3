BY ALBERT PERRY BRIGHAM When Washington first went to the Ohio country before the French and Indian War he began to see that roads must be built across the mountains to tie the West to the colonies by the sea This interest he never lost and it shaped his private action and public policy so long as he lived The greatest of our early Federal statesmen took up the cause and the first decades of the nineteenth century were marked by the planning and building of great high ways When Ohio was admitted to the Union in 1803 the enact ment was accompanied by a law setting apart the proceeds from sales of public lands in Ohio for the building of a highway Here was the origin of the Cumberland Road for which the first contracts were let in 1811 The stumps were to be removed for a width of four rods the roadbed was to be thirty feet wide and the road was to be surfaced with a heavy cover of broken stone West of the Monongahela the maximum grade was 42 degrees and in the western sections of the road where stone was not accessible the material used was gravel Thus by successive appropriations the great highway through Ohio to the westward was brought to com pletion and became known in preeminence as the National Road although by no means the only road for which Federal money was set apart In 1817 Calhoun gave expression to the general sentiment when he urged that the Republic be bound together by a perfect system of roads and canals He would have a trunk line from Maine to Louisiana a connection of the lakes with the Hudson 721Good Roads in the United States River and would join to the western States all the great com mercial centres on the Atlantic The cessation of this period of splendid roadbuilding came about 1836 and is ascribed to the financial crisis of that period but we can see another and more controlling reason The day of railways had dawned and it became plain that the long hauls must be made by steam The iron roads took the field and absorbed the resources and ambitions of progressive men and the dirt road and sometimes those who traversed it sank from view Of what account is an earth road when a locomotive can go fast and pull enormous loads When by and by the capitalist could go swiftly and in comfort from New York to Chicago and the member of Congress could draw his mileage and be whirled from San Francisco to Washington why should they concern themselves about the country roads Were they not as good as they had ever been And why after all should a farmer who gets his pace behind a plough wish to go faster Thus the dirt road became more dusty in sum mer and more deep in winter for seventyfive years Nobody seemed to appreciate the fact that a million and a half of miles of dirt roads crossed the land everywhere and that more millions of men and beasts must daily use them The State of Iowa has a hundred thousand miles of these roads and she spent upon them every year between two and three millions of dollars but under a wornout or rather an always bad plan that gave her little to show for it but mud of finer grain and greater depth Today this great State has adopted a money system in place of the old plan of loaf ing out a road tax under the direction of incompetent pathmasters This new understanding of our vast road problem began to show itself about twenty years ago and the interest has so risen that good earth roads in America are but a question of time The farmer is beginning to know that he is the factor of first industrial im portance and the capitalist and the statesman are also finding that whatever helps agriculture helps the town and city and blesses every citizen The farmer at least in the States of the east has seen toilsome and even profitless years in recent times Keep the farm up as he might by increasing toil he has seen the selling value of his land go steadily down and he has dragged his loads of produce to an indifferent market in vain competition with the great farmer of the prairies and has seen himself distanced in the acquirement of a competence by the tradesmen and skilled mechanics of the towns How far the decline in value of what he owns or is trying to 722Good Roads in the United States own is due to bad roads and expensive hauling he does not know but he is beginning to suspect that good roads would go far to bring back to him a reasonable prosperity The net shrinkage in the value of the farmers property in the Empire State from I890 to 900o was more than 69oo0ooo Thoughtful men have again and again urged that this shrinkage is largely due to bad roads and the present writer has seen no attempt to dispute this claim It is what Professor J A Holmes the champion of good roads in North Carolina calls the  mud sand and hill tax This covers the case for North Carolina with her mountains her Piedmont and her coastal plain In New York we should shorten it to mud and hill tax for we have our share of sticky soil and the pioneers arranged that a road should rarely go around a hill when it was possible to go up a hill and down again In Illinois it is enough to drop all the rest and call it mud tax pure and simple Shall we see what it is Professor Holmes places the amount of it in his State at o0000000 per year or as a good roads convention orator put it it is the same as if the farmers of North Carolina should each year kill every horse and mule in the State and buy new with clean cash or onetenth of the waste would give a seven months term to every school in the State The highway experts of Maryland make the very moderate esti mate that bad roads in this State handicap their people to the extent of 3000000 annually It costs about one billion dollars to haul the farm products of the United States to market each year Of this vast sum 6000ooo0000 are wasted on account of bad roads Much attention has been given to the relative cost of the several modes of transporting freight The unit chosen for comparison is the tonmilethat is the cost of carrying one ton of produce of an average sort a distance of one mile Basing their conclusion on correspondence with 10oooo farmers the Office of Public Road In quiries puts the cost per tonmile on dirt roads at 25 cents On the railway the figure is 94 of one cent or less By water the rate varies between Y4 and 112 of a cent As compared with the ocean rate we are informed that for the canal we must multiply by 5 for rail by 15 and when we come to the wagon on the country road we must take 500 for our multiplier The cost per tonmile on the New York Central Railway in 1869 was 2 4Io cents In 1893 the cost had gone down to 710 of a cent But where has been any reduction of the cost of the farmers preliminary haul except when in recent years improved roads have been built How much has he been helped as he has jolted 723Good Roads in the United States to market over the sods and cobblestones thrown into the mid dle of the roads by the pathmasters In a good roads con vention held in Raleigh in I902 it was said without contradic tion that it was as cheap to take freight from California to the eastern seaboard as to bring produce from farms fifteen miles away into Raleigh Through the consular offices of the United States it has been possible to learn the cost of highway transportation in European countries About Leeds in Yorkshire a twohorse team makes a tenmile trip going and returning in a day and pulls about 24 tons making six trips each week at a cost of 240 a trip About Sheffield the rate is 8 to 12 cents per tonmile In Germany the tonmile varies but is everywhere low about Frankfort it is equiva lent to Io cents in hauls of I2 miles In the district of Hanover for tenmile distances the rate is 4 i6 cents and about Munich 5 to 7 cents In Switzerland Canton of St Gall a double team draws 30 to 40 hundredweight on hilly roads and 50 to 60 hundredweight on level roads In France commercial agency of Roubaix the cost per tonmile is a little under I2 cents We need not wonder then at the expenditure by England and Wales of 20000000 annually upon their roads nor can we count it other than the highest economy that France expends each year 37500000 for the same purpose The average cost per tonmile of freight carriage upon good roads of broken stone is about 8 cents which taken with figures already given proclaims to the farmer that if he can get a good road he will save seventeen cents every time he draws a ton of wood wheat or potatoes a distance of one mile Upon the improved roads of New Jersey one team hauls four to five tons as against a badroad load of one ton At 300 per day for man and team this means a saving of 9oo to 1200 for a tenmile haul of such an amount of freight The estimate of saving for the State of New York falls into line with those of Maryland and North Carolina the figure being 7000000 to o ooo ooo per year Good roads would enable some comparatively longdistance hauling to be made by teaman important consideration in case of perishable produce and household furniture where much deterioration could be saved by avoiding railway transit Thus on the good roads of Belgium wagons carry freight 60 to 70 miles between Liege and Brussels or Antwerp The elements of loss arising from bad roads are many We 724Good Roads in the United States must count in the time of men and draftanimals the extra number of such animals employed where much teaming is required the exposure and extra hardship to which men and beasts are subject and the heavy strain and effective destruction of finish by which vehicles and harnesses are affected The farmer is also restricted in the times in which he can go to market If high prices happen to coincide with deep mud he cannot avail himself of the golden moment A Maryland farmer reports that he could not have marketed his wheat the previous season from February to April if the price had been 2oo a bushel Another lost his whole crop of corn because he could not carry it to a proper place of storage In France it is customary to use the cold or stormy days for hauling to market But the American farmer must use for hauling the very days that are most valuable for work on the farm No words can set forth all the elements or bring out all the meaning of the  mud tax It is unquestioned that good roads bring marked appreciation in the value of farm lands In Union County New Jersey it is affirmed that the rise in values has more than equalled the cost of the roads Similar improvement of conditions in parts of Indiana gives 648 per acre as the rise of the selling price of farm lands Much higher estimates have been given for some places as 20 to 30 per acre about Canandaigua N Y In brief if a farm neigh bourhood is reached by a good road a heavy tax is lifted from each bushel of produce and the region itself becomes a desirable place to live and prospective buyers are as willing to pay for these benefits as for rich soils heavy timber good fences and unfailing springs of water Moreover the farmers are often able to receive a daily paper regularly through free delivery and they thus get prompt informa tion of the state of the market and are not left to tardy rumour or the representations of commission agents Good roads bring large gains which cannot be reckoned in money As the older States have become great and the people have gathered in cities enjoying the conveniences of urban life life in the country has seemed isolated and barren The rural regions have been in some measure depopulated in favour of the towns and great cities The first factor in checking the rush from the country on the part of youth and progressive spirits must be the good road The county in which the writer lives has but three or four muni cipalities which exceed or approximate a population of 2000 The 725Good Roads in the United States total population of the county in I890 was 40545 From I89o to 900o the loss was 2347 The lands of the county are fairly adapted to agriculture and the building of comfortable homes and even the more remote are within 40 miles of cities In seeking the cause of this inability of a fertile region to hold its own in the number of its people we cannot go far wrong if we turn to the heavy grades deep muds ruts and stones of the dirt roads Twentytwo coun ties of the Empire State show a loss of 30266 in that decade or more than 3 per cent of their total population This decline is true of some rural counties near the city of New York and bad roads seem to be at least an important reason why the commuters have shunned the otherwise accessible parts of the home State in favour of the adjacent sections of New Jersey and Connecticut If the farmer and his wife or particularly his sons and daugh ters can finish their toilsome day and easily visit their neighbours three miles away in the evening or enjoy the opportunities of the town they will think better of rural life and cease to rob the farm of its more intelligent and more ambitious men and women In no way is the separateness of country life more relieved by good roads than by regulating attendance upon schools In not a few road conventions the schoolmaster has borne strong testimony to the improvement in education that must result from good roads It means regular attendance of thousands of youth and it also is the indispensable preliminary to the consolidation of rural schools This means betterpaid and betterqualified teachers better equip ment the pride and momentum of numbersindeed all the elements that unite in a school of power No less will religion and morals be favoured and social life advanced where church attendance is not checked by every storm and the habit of making Sunday a higher and separate day thus destroyed The duties of citizenship will be better performed and no longer will a rainy election day prevent a reasonably full expression of the political convictions of the rural voter And he will be far more sure to have convictions which are worth recording in a ballot for with good roads will come in the end the daily paper the telephone the habit of alert thinking and prompt and forcible action It is not claimed that good roads alone will reform society but that they count large in the chain of forces that is lifting country life to higher conditions There is yet another factor which tells both in point of money and of social life The city as well as the country is rightly com ing to be taxed for the rural road The city man and the city family find that they must seek the country for short visits for 726Good Roads in the United States long vacations or for permanent suburban homes No rural region can attract the urban man andShis money which compels him to walk or drive his horse or propel his automobile through seas of mud For a long period the Swiss Government lost money upon the diligences which carried passengers over its post roads Whether this is still true the writer does not know At any rate it made no difference with the official policy for what the public treasury lost the private pockets of the Swiss people gained many times over from the spendings of tourists This increased their resources increased their ability to pay taxes and the Government was after all no loser by its policy Such are some of the reasons why our roads should be made roads indeed rather than toilsome trails of sand and mud and in view of the facts which are simple and easy to understand it almost surpasses belief that a progressive people should have ignored their opportunities for almost a hundred years In I893 a law was enacted which again made the National Government a promoter of improved highways By this law the Office of Public Road Inquiries was created as a part of the Department of Agriculture It was not established to become an actual maker of roads but rather as a medium for information advice and supervision The office gathers data from all sources home and foreign reviews and disseminates a knowledge of important features of State legislation and studies the method and cost of construction It maintains a laboratory in Washington in which road materials are subjected to physical and chemical tests and any locality can have samples of home materials thus examined without cost While the Office does not engage formally in roadmaking it has for education built short sections of objectlesson roads in 22 States but always on the invitation of local authorities It has thus become a kind of clearinghouse for our national interest in roads not failing to reach out in every open direction to quicken interest and impart technical knowledge It has received only modest appropriations from the national treasury beginning with 8000 per year rising to 30000 in 1902 and to 35000 as the grant of the next succeeding Congress It has published a series of bulletins and circulars which are made freely available to all who can make good use of them The policy of Federal aid has strong advocates both in and out of Congress and this sentiment has crystallized in the wellknown LatimerBrownlow Bill which is now in the hands of the Senate Committee on Agriculture and which it is expected will be reported favourably in December 1904 It is strongly favoured by the 727Good Roads in the United States Grange and by many road organizations and provides for a propor tionate division of 24oooooe among the States to be expended at the rate of 8oooooo per year for three years In order to enjoy this aid each State must duplicate the sum to be received from the Government It seems to be well claimed that this is as proper a use of Government money as the improvement of rivers and harbours the aid of railways or the building of roadways through the national parks Among the powerful agencies is the National Good Roads As sociation having its headquarters at St Louis This grew out of a number of preliminary movements and was finally organized in Chicago in 900o when delegates were gathered representing thirty one States Many great conventions have been held the good roads trains have been organized the Association has worked in close relation with the Office of Public Road Inquiries on the one hand and the American people on the other and it has thus come to represent largely the sentiment and will of the people Many large conventionsas at OrmondDaytona Florida and at New Orleanshave been held during the past twelve months A com mittee of the Association secured through President McKinley the first presentation of this subject in Congress since the early days of the last century Many interests have given the good roads movement momentum Perhaps the wide adoption of the bicycle ten or fifteen years ago did more than anything else to agitate and to bring about action Every man who used a wheel became without planning it and before he was aware of it an advocate of good roads Then first did he know how bad the roads had been The League of Ameri can Wheelmen with its branches in every State organized and directed to the same end the sentiments of its tens of thousands of members Of late the automobile has been wielding a similar power The costly breakdowns of expensive machines and the delays and discomforts of people bent upon pleasure have created more appreciation of good country roads than any amount of indoor advocacy More powerful than these factors when we reckon in the com ing years appears to be the Rural Free Delivery of Mails The growth of this department of national postal work has been pro digious In I896 Congress voted a paltry Ioooo for it But it gave opportunity to test the new proposition The country dwellers took hold of it Slow in some things they may be but they have not been slow in this Now many millions of dollars are freely 728Good Roads in the United States voted and the new service reaches daily several millions of our citizens It is no longer an experiment It means more money for postage more letters written more papers taken swifter intel ligence of friends or businessin fact almost a revolution in the conditions of country life But the Post Office Department is exacting It will not send its carriers through sloughs of mud or along rough and stony roads or tearing through unopened masses of snow There must be a road reasonably good and there must be bridges passable in all seasons and as readily after prolonged storms as in the finest weather Tens of thousands of dollars have been spent on the highways at the direct instance of the Post Office Department As long ago as 1902 one hundred fords had been bridged in the State of Texas for this reason old roads had been improved and new lines of road created In the western division of rural service onefourth of all the routes favourably reported were to have improved roads as a result of the new enterprise In several Southern States applications have been rejected because the roads were impracticable for a regular and comfortable service In some cases it has been necessary to threaten discontinuance of the delivery service unless the roads were improved and results have been forthcoming Thus public policy and private interest conspire to the great end The railways have abiding reasons for wanting good country roads Every railway line offers a channel of outflow for the products of a belt of farm lands on either side These lands have access to the iron roads by the common highway If the farmer can reach the market at the railway station from distances limited to eight to ten miles the railway taps a belt of country sixteen to twenty miles wide double the distance for the haul that can be made with a profit remaining and the belt becomes thirty to forty miles wide The farmer will plant more acres ship more bulky produce have more money order more goods by express take more railway journeysin short the railway serves a rich region instead of a poor one Officials of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad state that in February 1898 their receipts were 65 per cent lower than for the same month in 1897 and 80 per cent lower than in February 1896 on account of severe weather and bad country roads The opinion is held that with good roads many railways could dispense with one third of their rolling stock because of the regularity in receiving freight throughout the year and because it would usually be pos sible to haul loaded cars in both directions 729Good Roads in the United States Great lines of railway have shown their interest in practical and substantial ways and most conspicuously by bearing the ex pense of sending good roads trains over their lines and maintain ing them for several months at a time With these trains will be found experts from the Office of Public Road Inquiries officials of the National Good Roads Association and of the railways them selves TLhey carry an outfit of roadmaking machinery which is sent for free use by manufacturing concerns which appreciate the gains of so good an opportunity to exhibit their wares It has been suggested that cementmakers be invited to take part and show what they can do in making sample culverts and bridges The train visits localities in succession stopping at each for several days The locality furnishes the material and feeds and lodges the workmen A considerable fraction of a mile of objectlesson road usually results from the visit At the same time a conven tion is commonly held which has often been heralded by emphatic messages from the Governors of States and is addressed by mem bers of legislatures and of the National Congress by road experts localroad officials by teachers farmers and progressive men of many occupations The National Good Roads Convention held in St Louis in April 1903 was addressed by Senators from Tennessee and South Carolina by General Nelson A Miles and President Jesse of the University of Missouri by Hon Wm J Bryan by the Governors of Texas and Iowa and by the President of the United States This meeting was not held in connection with the migration of a good roads train but is fairly representative of the breadth and strong interest of many such conventions About four years ago the President of the National Good Roads Association asked the Illinois Central Railway to send out a train at a cost of 40000 to 50000oo The president of the railway said  That is a large amount to throw in the mud but we will consider it They considered it and they did it and the result was a chain of road conventions and sample roads from Chicago to New Orleans uniting in a great industrial and social enterprise the men of North and South Trains have since been sent out by the Lake Shore Great Northern Southern and other railways The train of the Southern Railway system left Alexandria Virginia October 29 190o and was at work the Christmas holidays ex cepted until the following April Nearly fifteen miles of road were built in six States and eighteen conventions were held of which five were State conventions When we observe that the Alabama conventions were held and sample roads built at Birming 730Good Roads in the United States ham Montgomery and Mobile while in Virginia the chosen points were Danville Lynchburg Charlottesville and Richmond we sufficiently show the influence likely to be exerted over the whole of these great States The possibility of employing convict labour has been a consider able factor in road development especially in the Southern States In those States in the year 1900 4377 convicts were employed in building public highways It is urged that during the same period 7000 men were confined in county jails in that part of the Union who might better have been building highways for the use and advantage of citizens than living in idleness at a heavy cost to the public Professor Holmes speaking for North Carolina says that ex perience has been favourable to this system of convict employment both in its efficiency and in respect of the health of the man Cer tain inducements were offered such as a reward or a shortening of terms for those who were faithful After trial of a year no attempts to escape had been made and the prisoners had been kept at a less cost than when in ordinary confinement Prisoners guilty of murder rape and arson were made an exception in the matter of road service and were held behind prison walls The road law of Delaware passed in I893 provides for the purchase of a quarry where stone shall be broken for roads by con vict labour The general policy is opposed by the Prison Associa tion of New York because of interference with free labour danger of escapes and the demoralization through much publicity both of the prisoners and the people at large On the other hand it is urged that ablebodied men are rewarded for crime by being supported in idleness and that factory labour in prisons is indeed hostile to free labour The outofdoor exercise is good for the men and the sight of them is claimed rather to be a deterrent from crime It is urged that in the South the transfer from a system of contracts made with irresponsible and often cruel private parties to the humane care of public authorities would be a kindness to the con victed criminal The middle ground is also taken that machinery will largely do away with hand labour in actual roadmaking hence it is proposed to concentrate convicts at quarries in the prepara tion of materials to be shipped by railways under permanent con tracts to the points where the material is needed This would involve the erection of prison buildings at such locations of quar ries Warden Grimes of New Jersey favours the use of convicts and 731Good Roads in the United States thinks it will stop the labour agitation against prison manufactures He also affirms that the condition of the men has improved under the system In California by a law of 1895 it was decided to employ convicts in public work which on account of its cost would not otherwise be undertaken A rockcrushing plant was put in at Folsom where the material for roads is good and this material has been sold at prices of 25 to 30 cents per ton and this at a profit to the State The Southern Pacific Railway Company conceded low transportation the rate being about threefourths of a cent per mile This plan has promoted roadbuilding in Stockton Marys ville Sacramento and other towns In South Carolina prison vans have been used enabling prisoners to camp where the work is done thus reducing the cost of maintenance Massachusetts was one of the first States to adopt the plan of State aid and to place its roads under the control of a highway commission one of whose three members must be a competent engineer State aid was voted in 1892 and the eleventh annual report of date 1904 has now appeared These reports are valuable records of methods and progress The State has i7000 miles of public roads State highways 482 miles in extent were completed by the close of 1903 The gravel roads have been built at a cost of 1500 to 2000 per mile and the macadam roads have cost 8000 per mile 646 petitions for roads have been received contemplating the location and building of 1663 miles of highway The State pays threefourths the counties onefourth and main tenance is by the State An important law known as the  small town act was passed in 1900 Since that time 255 petitions have come from ioi towns The work consists of cutting hills to good grades filling and draining The greatest gain is in the fact that this work is planned and directed by experts but is carried out by local road officials who thus get a most important training After five years of trial it can be positively stated that there is a marked improve ment of the country roads throughout the Commonwealth and that this improvement is entirely due to the socalled small town act New York has for several years been among the more pro gressive States in the improvement of highways Under the leader ship of State Engineer Edward A BondMr William Pierrepont White of Utica and others public sentiment has been widely aroused and the needed legislation has been secured The larger amount of State aid has been granted under what is known as the 732Good Roads in the United States HigbieArmstrong Law It is proposed to build a system of main roads amounting to ten per cent of all the common roads in the State The extent of this undertaking is seen when it is under stood that there are 74097 miles of earth roads in total The Governors of the State took up the road interests in their messages in 1890 and following years and in 1896 and 1897 the farmers gave the subject attention in institutes held in many counties It is computed that good roads will save Iooooooo per year in the preliminary haul of produce Under the HigbieArmstrong Act the State pays onehalf the cost of improvement the county thirty five per cent and the town fifteen per cent The Legislature of I902 appropriated 795000 and the amount set apart for the current year 1904 rose to 1I08265 This item is under the HigbieArmstrong Act and further appropriations for roadwork bring the total for 1904 to 5oo0ooo As a result nearly 500 miles of main road will have been finished by the close of this year and the counties have provided their share for 767 miles more which will be built as soon as State funds are available A large convention of the supervisors of towns from most of the counties is annually held in Albany and the sentiment of the people is thus organized and brought to bear on the legislative and the executive authorities There is a strong movement to raise 50000ooo by bonding that the benefits of the ten per cent of trunk roads may not be lost to thepresent generation It is urged with much force that this is as reasonable as to raise ioo0ooooo by this means for the Erie Canal when a large proportion of the farmers are in no way benefited by that waterway Under the old plan 2000000 days of labour were supposed to be expended on the roads each year an outlay purporting to amount to 3ooo00000 There was little but mud and dust to show for this and yet for many years these conditions aroused sur prisingly little criticism The law for the benefit of main roads has now been supplemented by the Fuller Law by whichthe counties may adopt a money system and receive fifty per cent of State aid for the improvement of the sidelines of road thus giving the rural residents everywhere an equitable share of improvements This in its results is somewhat like the small town act in Massachusetts and 358 townsin New York have taken advantage of it during the year 1904 Hon Martin Dodge director of the office of Public Road Inquiries affirmed in April 1903 that in New York more permanent improvements in the highways had been made in two years under Stateaid laws than had been made in two hundred 733Good Roads in the United States years before The State Supervisors also are in favour of the system of county engineers of the adoption of a widetire law and of the enactment of the Brownlow Bill by the National Govern ment The work is in an advanced state in New Jersey where in 1901 1ooo miles of road had been built under the Stateaid plan The construction of stone roads began in I891 and State aid was voted in I893 It is said that Ioo to I25 baskets of produce now make an ordinary load where before 25 baskets formed the average and it is believed that the sum of 27oooooo has been added to agri cultural values in the State There has been a great awakening in the South as has been hinted in our notice of the good roads train of the Southern Rail way No State has been more active in these improvements than North Carolina Mecklenburg County is one of the progressive centres of the work and this single county had in I90o one hun dred miles of stone road and five to ten miles of new road were being added each year The interested reader is referred to a vivacious account of the road movement about Charlotte in this county in an address by Captain S B Alexander found in Bulletin 24 Office of Public Road Inquiries Reference has been made to work in a few of the older States but the reader is not to suppose that the new interest in roads is circumscribed or local It is as nearly nonsectional nonpolitical and universal as any movement in recent years Pennsylvania has set apart 6500000 to be expended upon her roads during the next six years Illinois has appointed a good roads commission with a view to amending the road laws Alabama is among the more progressive Southern States in providing for special taxes and permitting the issue of bonds The reader will find a review of recent road legislation in 26 States in the yearbook of the Department of Agriculture for I903 and in recent publications of the National Good Roads Association Few economic and social problems are so important as this and in few is the way so fully open for solution in the immediate future Nearly every region has suitable road materials as at Mobile where the people of the Southern Railway Good Roads Train built a sample road of oystershells covered with gravel The Office of Public Road Inquiries often finds that materials are brought from a distance through ignorance of those which as good or better lie unused but near at hand The present waste is inexcusable in view of present experience 734Good Roads in the United States The millions now sunk in mudholes can swiftly by new methods be turned into profitable channels Not every county pathmaster can receive an engineers training but the principal highways can be constructed by engineers and the lessused feeders can receive oversight as in Massachusetts and as contemplated by the county engineer system in New York The technical requirements will be met and the money will be at hand when the majority of the rural people know a good road and demand its advantages If the tech nical schools which we have cannot provide the necessary training we may develop somewhere in this country a school similar to the French National School of Bridges and Highways Mr D R Francis of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition recalls the time when the courts had to compel abutting property to pay paving assessments in cities and he urges that to raise 3000ooooo a year in Missouri would only require a tax of 25 cents on each 1oo which would probably add 5 per acre to the land values of the State The burden should fall as it is falling upon city and country alike for every citizen harvests the blessings of improved highways With roadbuilding will go a good measure of relocation in all regions of much relief correcting so far as possible the mis takes of the pioneers A recent survey has shown that a road can be carried up the rugged slopes of Grandfather Mountain in the Appalachians of North Carolina with a maximum grade of 5 per cent The  hill tax  of Professor Holmes will be reduced as the farmer and tourist are lifted out of the slough and sent on their way rejoicing Not much longer will the careless farmer or manu facturer be allowed to plough the roads old or new when a wide tire becomes a roadmaker rather than a roadwrecker It is no new idea for the widetired wheel was urged by Albert Gallatin in the roadmaking days of long ago and effective enactments are sure to follow the building of costly roads If America be the most progressive nation in the world her citizens will not much longer endure medieval discomforts when they go out to mingle with their fellows and market the fruits of their fields 735

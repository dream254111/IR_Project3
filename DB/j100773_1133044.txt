j100773,Journal of the American Institute of Criminal Law and Criminology,1133044,Problems for the Prison Association,i247456,PROBLEMS FOR THE PRISON ASSOCIATION is reviewed in the present issue of this JOURNAL Ignorance at this point cannot be hidden under words We do not know whether as a matter of fact there are born criminals who if recognized at a sufficiently early day may not by fitting treatment be inclined toward social conduct Perhaps this is one point that investigation in the future may make plain But certainly it is true that there are individuals in our prisons and very unfortunately abroad in the land upon whom our best edu cational or reformatory measures are bent in vain One of these perhaps is the selfconfessed murderer of Annie Lemberger whose case is cited on another page The educational must be supplemented by the pro tective point of view There are criminals who remain uninfluenced in the face of the best treatment that we can apply For the safety of all the sooner they are recognized the better and when once dis covered the only sane policy to pursue with respect to them is isolation from society One point more The criminal is the exceptional case to whom our social theories and practices do not apply In science generally it is universally true that the vexatious exceptions are the source of sug gestions of new hypotheses which in due time have changed the face of a considerable body or the whole of science It may not be too much to expect that the interaction between social institutions on the one hand and the exceptional misfits on the other will eventually be the means of correcting both here a little and there a little There is profit in everything and time and wisdom will bring it to light R I G PROBLEMS FOR THE PRISON ASSOCIATION I wish to indicate here what I believe to be the most essential prin ciples approved by the various resolutions of the International Prison Congress at Washington and to propose certain problems which have vital significance for us in America The Congress at Washington was divided for purposes of discussion by specialists into four sections criminal law and procedure penitentiary administrations preventive methods treatment of children and youth The central and dominant principle which came up in each of the four sections may be thus stated The community seeks to protect its interests through criminal law correctional institutions preventive measures and care of morally im periled children and youth by deterrent penalties by reformatory treat ment in institutions by supervision of convicts free on parole and by improvement of conditions which affect the character of the young The interests which society thus seeks to guard are order security of life 496PROBLEMS FOR THE PRISON ASSOCIATION and property respect for valuable institutions and the general wel fare and progress of all members of the nation In the first section on Law and Procedure the specific conclusion reached was thus stated The Congress approves the scientific principle of the indeterminate sentence The indeterminate sentence should be applied to moral and mental defectives The indeterminate sentence should be applied also as an important part of the reformatory system to criminals particularly juvenile of fenders who require reformation and whose offenses are due chiefly to circumstances of an individual character The weakness of this statement is that it fails to define what is meant by the vague phrase indeterminate sentence Those who are working on the problems therefore which are pre sented by our prison population should formulate and discuss a series of propositions such as the following 1 A disclaimer and explanation When we use the term inde terminate sentence we do not mean to ask any indefinite arbitrary irresponsible power for the prison administration we do not ask that legislatures and courts should be excluded from control over the penalties for crime and the methods of treating offenders The discussions of the indeterminate sentence at Washington in the papers and in European journals show that the word indeterminate is widely misunderstood and that it suggests to many legal minds some thing capricious and arbitrary Apparently many of our European friends have made themselves believe that we would be willing to de liver up a convict to the prison administration to be deprived of liberty indefinitely at the absolute discretion of the executive and administra tive branch of government that we would limit the power of the legis lature to the definition of criminal actions and the courts to the decla ration of guilt while all the rest would be left to the arbitrary control of prison authorities without legal or judicial limitations or directions Against such indefinite and arbitrary power the legal mind every where revolts I do not understand that our representative leaders on behalf of the socalled indeterminate sentence have ever advocated any think so essentially contradictory to our legal beliefs and principles What they have asked is rather the abolition of the irrational and arbi trary laws of the past based originally on vengeance and compensation and the substitution of a sentence based on social defense and reformation But we have not yet made sufficiently clear to ourselves what is the best 497PROBLEMS FOR THE PRISON ASSOCIATION kind of organ for carrying out this principle in practice The Congress at Washington voted that the board of parole should be substantially a judicial body with powers like those of our Juvenile Courts capable of carrying out the purpose of the law by modifying the treatment of a pris oner from time to time as indicated by the conduct of the convicted person 2 A positive demand We do insist that the legislature provide sentences sufficiently prolonged for effective educational methods in the case of educable persons who are capable of reformation and control sufficiently prolonged in the case of habitual professional dangerous criminals to afford protection against them and to be deterrent in gen eral society From both standpoints time is an essential factor the period slhould be fixed not by some arbitrary guess at what certain acts deserve but by a scientific study of the measures necessary to prevent crirre and to reform those who have formed antisocial habits 3 In carrying out the measures of reformation education and social protection we ask that the necessary modifications be made in judicial methods a Thatunder the present lawsthe sentence given by judges should be such as to give time for the working of the discipline of the parole system b That the period of parole or conditional freedom under supervision be fixed by a special court or board at the time of parole and not in advance of the period of observation during the serving of the sentence inside the institution The conduct of the prisoner is one of the considerations which make a wise decision possible And parole itself should be made dependent in great measure on good conduct in the prison itself This is a powerful aid to the reformatory efforts of the prison administration 4 Advanced legislation is desirable to make effective the advanced ideas of punishment and reformation and this legislation should be based on modern knowledge of the difference in the character and re quirements of various classes of offenders Already this demand has been accepted by legislators in respect to juvenile offenders The establishment of institutions for the care of various classes of defectives illustrates the influence of modern psy chology and scientific education in respect to this group of offenders It is true that the legislators of some states are slow and backward and that the administrative methods are often imperfect but the victory of 498PROBLEMS FOR THE PRISON ASSOCIATION mnodern principles is fairly won and legislation will not move backward from the ground that has been gained We have the beginnings of a rational ard effective method of deal ing with the incapable morally weak habitual drunkards and those wrecked by drugs and vicious indulgence But legislators and their legal advisers should learn how futile even damaging are the methods of treating persons of this class under present legal conceptions A pro longed period of medical control with steady labor much of it in the open air is absolutely essential to any degree of success with this dis couraging group of offenders The short jail sentence has been demon strated by thousands of cases to be worse than uselesss costly to society destructive of what little physical and moral stamina may remain The farm colonies of Belgium Holland Switzerland and similar experiments in the United States point the new way Legislators and their legal advisers are under moral obligation to devise a more rational and just method of dealing with habitual offenders of the more dangerous and obstinate type such as professional thieves burglars and potential mur ders Present laws often encourage a treatment of these classes that is a mockery of justice and that tends to make lynch law and riots re spectable When it is morally certain as judged by past conduct and repeated crimes that a criminal will attack peaceable citizens it is mon strous to let him go merely because he has served a definite time to ex piate the guilt of a single specific act Legislators and their legal advisers are under moral obligations to the community to make adequate legal provision for the payment of a sufficient corps of parole officers of the right kind to supervise the con duct of convicts out on parole It is an injury to the cause of the parole system to set a large number of convicts even conditionally free without proper supervision Experience proves beyond doubt that many of them will be tempted into their old ways if they are left to their own devices When once the state has taken possession of an offender it ought to do thorough work with him It is childish to inflict on him a definite sentence of suffering and loss and then let him go as if he were a normal citizen His conduct shows he is not a normal citizen be cause the vast majority of persons in the same circumstances do not act criminally The court in pronouncing sentence declares a public judgment about the man as well as about his deed If the state is logical consistent and wise it will follow up the authorized condemna tion with a treatment which will give full effect to the discovery and decision of its courts by surrounding its paroled convicts with all the 499PROBLEMS FOR THE PRISON ASSOCIATION help necessary to accomplish the end of protecting life property de cency order and respect for social institutions To summarize some of the more important and urgent demands which the discussion at Washington has forced anew upon our attention 1 The supreme purpose of prisons and preventive measures is to protect and promote social welfare including so far as possible the real interest of the offender 2 The treatment of the convict must be more thorough prolonged and determined than it has been or can be under the system of fixed sentences 3 The administration of the treatment must never be arbitrary nor in contradiction with the modern constitutional division of re sponsibility between the legislature courts and administration 4 A state central board with judicial powers analogous to those of Juvenile Courts should be invested with the authority to administer the parole system It should be constituted in accordance with the principles approved by the International Prison Congress at Washington 5 The different methods of dealing with youth morally enfeebled and perverted adults improvable younger offenders and habitual or dangerous criminals should be given a permanent legal basis and state institutions should be provided for affording treatment adapted to the character of each group with large opportunity for individual treatment 6 That such treatment may be guided by thorough knowledge of the character of the offenders persons of training should be employed by the state to assist the administration by observation and study of the life histories of convicts and a scientific record should be kept of the conduct of paroled persons to show the actual results secured 7 The parole system should be made effective by provision for an adequate number of competent and trained parole officers 8 The probation system should be developed and administered so as to avoid as far as possible prison treatment for noncriminal offenders 9 All institutions for dealings with offenders and especially county jails should be brought under central state control Jails should become places solely for detention awaiting trial and all persons con victed of crime should be transferred at once to state institutions estab lished in convenient districts in large states and adapted to the needs of various classes of offenders C R H 500

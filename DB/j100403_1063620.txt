J100403,VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW,1063620,THE EXTENT TO WHICH A JUDGMENT OR DECREE VALID IN ONE STATE WILL BE DENIED VALIDITY IN OTHER STATES OF THIS UNION,I243784,VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW FORM THE BASIS OF SUCH AN ACTION17 A GROSS OVERVALUATION HOW EVER RAISES A PRESUMPTION OF FRAUD AND SHAREHOLDERS MUST PAY THE FULL PAR VALUE AT THE INSTANCE OF CREDITORS UNLESS THEY CAN REBUT IT EVEN THOUGH THE CORPORATION ITSELF COULD NOT HAVE ENFORCED PAY MENT18 THE PROPERTY OF A CORPORATION SOLVENT OR INSOLVENT BEARS IDEN TICALLY THE SAME RELATION TO THE CREDITORS OF THE CORPORATION AS THE PROPERTY OF AN INDIVIDUAL OR PARTNERSHIP BEARS TO THE CREDITORS OF SUCH INDIVIDUAL OR PARTNERSHIP IT IS IMPRESSED WITH A TRUST CHAR ACTER ONLY UNDER THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER THE SAME CON DITIONS AS WOULD BE THE PROPERTY OF AN INDIVIDUAL OR PARTNERSHIP AN INDIVIDUAL NOT IN DEBT CAN GIVE HIS PROPERTY AWAY PROVIDED THAT HE DOES NOT INTEND TO DEFEAT FUTURE CREDITORS SO ALSO CAN A PARTNERSHIP UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES GIVE ITS PROPERTY AWAY AND IN THE ABSENCE OF CHARTER RESTRICTIONS THE SAME THING WOULD BE TRUE OF A CORPORATION THE REMEDY AGAINST A CORPORATION IN SUCH CASES RESTS UPON PRECISELY THE SAME GROUND AS DOES THE REMEDY AGAINST AN INDIVIDUAL OR PARTNERSHIP AND THE BASIS OF THIS REMEDY IS NOT THAT THE ASSETS ARE HELD IN TRUST FOR THE BENEFIT OF CREDITORS BUT RATHER THAT A FRAUD IS PERPETUATED UPON THE CREDITORS AGAINST WHICH EQUITY WILL GIVE RELIEF AS READILY TO THE CREDITOR OF A CORPORATON AS TO THE CREDITOR OF AN INDIVIDUAL OR PARTNERSHIP WHEN CHANCERY ONCE TAKES HOLD IT WILL ADMINISTER THE PROPERTY FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL THE CREDIT ORS BEFORE IT AND IN THIS WAY THE COURT BECOMES A SORT OF TRUSTEE SUB MODO BUT NOT WITH REFERENCE TO THE CHARACTER OF THE ESTATE THE EXTENT TO WTHICH A JUDGMENT OR DECREE VALID IN ONE STATE WILL BE DENIED VALIDITY IN OTHER STATES OF THIS UNIONTHE OPERATION OF EVERY JUDGMENT MUST DEPEND UPON THE POWER OF THE COURT TO RENDER THAT JUDGMENT1 FROM THIS IT FOLLOWS NECESSARILY THAT WHEN IT IS SOUGHT TO ENFORCE IN ONE COUNTRY THE JUDG MENT OF THE COURT OF ANOTHER THE COURT OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THE FOREIGN JUDGMENT IS TO BE ENFORCED HAS THE RIGHT TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE FOREIGN TRIBUNAL PRONOUNCING THE JUDGMENT HAD LAWFUL JURISDICTION FROM THIS ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLE HAS RESULTED THE RULE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW THAT IN ORDER TO FOUND A PROPER GROUND OF RECOGNITION OF ANY FOREIGN JUDGMENT IN ANOTHER COUNTRY IT IS NECES SARY FIRST TO ESTABLISH THAT THE COURT PRONOUNCING THE JUDGMENT HAD LAWFUL JURISDICTION OVER THE CAUSE THE

THE VALIDITY OF A JUDGMENT LOCALLY WHICH MEETS THE JURISDIC TIONAL REQUISITES OF THE TERRITORIAL LAW3 ASSUMING THAT A COURT OF THE FOREIGN STATE HAS JURISDICTION AC CORDING TO THE PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW SO THAT SOME FORCE MUST BE GIVEN THE JUDGMENTS IN OTHER STATES THE VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION ARISES AS TO WHAT FORCE AND EFFECT IS TO BE GIVEN TO THE FOR EIGN JUDGMENT IN SUCH OTHER STATES WHETHER THE FOREIGN JUDGMENT SHOULD BE HELD CONCLUSIVE UPON THE MERITS OR WHETHER IT SHOULD BE OPEN TO REEXAMINATION UPON THE ORIGINAL MERITS ARE QUESTIONS UPON WHICH THERE HAS BEEN MUCH DI VERSITY OF OPINION AS WELL AS OF PRACTICE IT WAS TO PREVENT THESE LATTER PERPLEXING QUESTIONS FROM ARISING AS BETWEEN THE STATES OF THIS UNION IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT CLAUSE WAS EMBODIED INTO THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION IN CHOOSING BETWEEN THESE TWO ALTERNATIVESTHE CONCLUSIVE OR THE PRIMA FACIE EFFECT OF A JUDG MENT OF ANOTHER STATE THE CONSTITUTION HAS PROVIDED THAT FULL FAITH AND CREDIT SHALL BE GIVEN IN EACH STATE TO THE PUBLIC ACTS RECORDS AND JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS OF EVERY OTHER STATE4 CONGRESS IS EM POWERED BY THE SAME SECTION TO PRESCRIBE BY GENERAL LAW THE MANNER IN WHICH SUCH ACTS RECORDS AND JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS SHALL BE PROVED AND THE EFFECT THEREOF ACCORDINGLY CONGRESS HAS PASSED AN ACT 5 WHICH AFTER PRESCRIBING THE MANNER IN WHICH THE AUTHENTICATION MAY BE MADE PROVIDES THAT THE SAID RECORDS AND JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS SO AUTHENTICATED SHALL HAVE SUCH FAITH AND CREDIT GIVEN TO THEM IN EVERY COURT WITHIN THE UNITED STATES AS THEY HAVE BY LAW OR USAGE IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE FROM WHICH THEY ARE TAKEN IN CONSTRUING THESE PROVISIONS THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS ESTABLISHED BY A LONG LINE OF DECISIONS THAT A FINAL JUDG MENT OR DECREE PRONOUNCED BY A COURT OF COMPETENT AUTHORITY HAVING JURISDICTION OF THE PARTIES OF THE SUBJECTMATTER AND OF THE CAUSE IS FOR THE MOST PART CONCLUSIVE IN EVERY OTHER COURT IN THE UNITED STATES6 HOWEVER THE JUDGMENT OF A STATE COURT IS NOT TO BE REGARDED AS A DOMESTIC JUDGMENT IN THE COURTS OF THE OTHER STATES OR OF THE UNITED STATES IN THE SENSE THAT EXECUTION MAY ISSUE THEREON IN SUCH OTHER STATE WITHOUT THE NECESSITY OF A SUIT ON THE JUDGMENT OR THAT IT ENJOYS THE SAME RIGHT OF PRIORITY PRIVILEGE OR LIEN WHICH IT HAS IN THE STATE WHERE IT IS PRONOUNCED7 NOR ARE THE PROVISIONS UNDER CONSIDERATION MERELY DECLARATORY OF THE FAITH AND CREDIT TO WHICH THE JUDGMENT OF ONE STATE IN ENTITLED IN ANOTHER BY THE COMITY OF NATIONS BUT THE INTENTION SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN AS EXPRESSED BY MR

ESTABLISHED THE JUDGMENT SHALL BE CONCLUSIVE AS TO THE MERITS 8 BUT THIS DOES NOT PREVENT AN INQUIRY BY THE COURT OF THE STATE IN WHICH IT IS SOUGHT TO ENFORCE THE JUDGMENT OF ANOTHER STATE INTO THE INTERNATIONAL JURISDICTION OF THE TRIBUNAL PRONOUNCING THE JUDGMENT NOR AN INQUIRY INTO THE RIGHT OF THE STATE TO ASSUME JURISDICTION OVER THE PARTIES OR OVER THE SUBJECT MATTER NOR DOES IT PREVENT AN INQUIRY WHETHER THE JUDGMENT IS OBTAINED THROUGH AND THEREFORE IMPEACHABLE FOR A MANIFEST FRAUD9 IT SEEMS THEN THAT AS BETWEEN THE STATES OF THIS UNION THE INTERNATIONAL REQUISITES OF JURISDICTION ARE APPLIED IN DETERMINING WHETHER ANY EFFECT SHALL BE GIVEN THE JUDGMENTS AND DECREES OF ANOTHER STATE AND THAT THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT CLAUSE OF THE CONSTITUTION FINDS APPLICATION ONLY IN DE TERMINING WHAT EFFECT SHALL BE GIVEN I E WHETHER CONCLUSIVE OR PRIMA FACIE IT WOULD SEEM ALSO TO FOLLOW THAT THOUGH THE JUDG MENT OF A STATE MAY NOT RECEIVE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT IN ANOTHER STATE BECAUSE THE JURISDICTIONAL FACTS UPON WHICH THE JUDGNENT IS BASED DO NOT COMPLY WITH THE INTERNATIONAL REQUISITES YET THAT JUDGMENT MAY BE VALID AND ENFORCEABLE DOMESTICALLY UNDER THE TER RITORIAL LAW10 BEFORE THE ADOPTION OF THE DUE PROCESS OF LAW CLAUSE BY WAY OF AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION THE JUDGMENTS OF THE COURTS OF A STATE MIGHT BE ENFORCEABLE DOMESTICALLY AND YET NOT BE GIVEN EFFECT

STATE DEPRIVE ANY PERSON OF LIFE LIBERTY OR PROPERTY WITH OUT DUE PROCESS OF LAW THIS UNFORTUNATE STATE OF AFFAIRS WAS IN LARGE MEASURE OBVIATED THIS CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION IS A PART OF THE MUNICIPAL LAW OF EACH STATE OPERATING INTRATERRITORIALLY UPON DOMESTIC PROCEEDINGS THE RULES OF PRIVATE INTERNATIONAL LAW ON THE OTHER HAND COME INTO PLAY ONLY WHEN THE INQUIRY EXTENDS TO THE EFFECT TO BE GIVEN IN ONE STATE TO THE JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS OF ANOTHER BUT THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT AND THE RULES OF PRIVATE INTERNA TIONAL LAW BOTH UNITE IN DECLARING THAT IN ORDER TO A VALID EXER CISE OF JURISDICTION BY A TRIBUNAL THERE MUST BE GIVEN TO A DEFEND ANT A REASONABLE NOTICE AND OPPORTUNITY TO DEFEND HIMSELF THERE MUST BE DUE PROCESS OF LAW  1 THEREFORE IN SO FAR AS THE DUE PROCESS OF LAW CLAUSE IS APPLICABLE A JUDGMENT WHICH IS VALID IN THE STATE WHERE IT IS RENDERED IS ENTITLED FOR THE MOST PART TO FULL FAITH AND CREDIT IN EVERY OTHER COURT IN THE UNITED STATES THE DUE PROCESS OF LAW CLAUSE HOWEVER APPLIES ONLY TO CASES INVOLVING LIFE LIBERTY OR PROPERTY AND AS QUESTIONS OF STATUS SUCH AS DIVORCE DO NOT FALL WITHIN THIS CATEGORY THIS CLAUSE W6ULD HAVE NO APPLICATION TO THEM AS TO

RE GARDED AND NO ACTION WILL LIE FOR DAMAGES WHICH DO NOT FLOW PROXI MATELY FROM THE ACT COMPLAINED OF THIS PRINCIPLE IS OF THE HIGH EST IMPORTANCE SINCE THE RIGHT OF ACTION IN MANY CASES AND THE EX TENT OF RECOVERY IN OTHERS DEPEND UPON IT CAUSES OF LEGAL INJURY MAY BE DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES FIRST THOSE ACTS OR OMISSIONS WHICH ARE WANTON OR WILLFUL VIOLATIONS OF THE LAW AND ARE THEREFORE WRONGFUL IN THEMSELVES 2 SECOND THOSE CAUSES WHICH ARE NOT IN THEMSELVES DISTINCT LEGAL WRONGS BUT WHICH BECOME WRONG AND BY REASON OF THIS FACT GIVE RISE TO A RIGHT OF AC TION IN FAVOR OF THE PERSON SUSTAINING INJURY AS A PROXIMATE RESULT OF THE WRONGFUL ACT3 THE FIRST CLASS DIVIDES ITSELF INTO TWO HEADS FIRST THOSE WRONGS WHICH IN THEIR INCEPTION CONSTITUTE AN INVASION OF THE RIGHTS OF THE PARTICULAR PERSON INJURED4 SECOND THOSE WRONGFUL ACTS OR OMSSIONS WHICH ARE WILLFUL VIOLATIONS OF THE LAW BUT WHICH DO NOT IN THEMSELVES ORIGINALLY INTERFERE WITH THE RIGHTS OF THE COMPLAINANT5 IF THE ORIGINAL ACT INVADED THE RIGHTS OF THE PERSON COMPLAINING THE LAW WILL PRESIME THAT THE DAMAGE FOLLOWED AS THE NATURAL NECESSARY AND PROXIMATE RESULT6 HENCE THIS CLASS OF CASES CAN BE DISPOSED OF WITHOUT FURTHER DISCUSSION BECAUSE HERE THE INVASION ITSELF FIXES THE RIGHT OF ACTION TO THE PERSON COM PLAINING AND HE IS ENTITLED TO A RECOVERY PER SE THOUGH THE DAMAGES SUFFERED MAY BE NOMINAL BUT IF THE ORIGINAL AND WRONGFUL ACT OR OMISSION COMPLAINED OF IN ITSELF INTERFERED WITH NO RIGHTS OF THE COMPLAINANT BUT WAS MERELY IN VIOLATION OF SOME LAW THE COMPLAIN ANT MUST NOT ONLY SHOW DAMAGES RESULTING TO HIM FROM THE ACT OR OMISSION BUT HE MUST SHOW IN ADDITION THAT THE DAMAGES RESULTED PROXIMATELY THEREFROM7 IN SUCH CASES RECOVERY IS ALLOWED NOT ON  SEE HADDOCK V HADDOCK 201 U S 562 COOK

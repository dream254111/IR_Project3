to two special pleas filed by the defendant Sands  Sands for plaintiff Olin Bryan Henry Flegenheimer and Melvin Flegenheimer for defendant HON R CARTER SCOTT Judge It appears from the record that Charles W Plunkett applied for membership in the Improved Order Heptasophs on June 28 1897 and in his application he agreed to conform in all respects to the laws rules and usages of the order now in force or which may hereafter be adopted by the same Upon said application he was admitted as a member and on the 12th day of August 1897 a benefit certificate for the sum of two thousand dollars 2 000 was issued him his wife Estelle V Plunkett bene ficiary This certificate was delivered and accepted upon the con dition that the said brother herein complies with the laws rules and regulations now governing said conclave and benefit fund or that may in the future be enacted by the Supreme Conclave to govern said conclave and fund At the time Plunkett applied Reported by George C Gregory 42 MayPLUNKETT V IMP ORDER HEPTASOPHS for membership and at the time the benefit certificate was deliv ered to him there was no bylaw of the company in regard to suicide At the session of the Supreme Conclave held in June 1903 section known as 257 of constitution and bylaws was en acted This section provides as follows No benefit shall be paid to the beneficiary or beneficiaries of any member committing suicide sane or insane provided however that where such suicide has completed one year of membership although the Supreme Con clave shall by this act be released from all claims represented by the benefit certificate his beneficiary or beneficiaries shall never theless receive from the Supreme Conclave a sum of money in full discharge of all demands which he she or they might otherwise have had upon said Supreme Conclave equal to the equitable pro portion of the total benefit such equity to be determined by the number of years the suicide was a member of the order as related to his expectancy of life when admitted This bylaw was in force on the 9th day of August 1903 upon which day Charles W Plun kett committed suicide and died from the effects of a pistol shot wound inflicted by himself with suicidal intent The beneficiary upon proper proofs of death made a demand for the face value of the benefit certificate to wit the sum of two thousand dollars The demand was refused and thereupon she brought her action The defendant tendered two special pleas The first alleged that in the application and also in the benefit certificate that Charles W Plunkett promised to conform in all respects to the laws etc in force at the time of said application and benefit certificate and those thereafter to be adopted and that section 257 had been thereafter adopted and that the said Plunkett committed suicide and died from the effects of a pistol wound inflicted by himself with suicidal intent The second plea set forth the above facts and in addition thereto that in accordance with section 257 the defend ant was indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of 33334 and that on the day when the said sum became due the defendant tendered the plaintiff said sum and that the plaintiff wholly refused to accept and that the defendant has ever been and still is ready to pay the said plaintiff the said sum which the defendant brought and paid into court To both of these pleas the plaintiff demurred It was contended in support of said demurrer that the bylaw interfered 1905 4311 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER with rights which had become fixed and vested by the terms of the original contract The demurrer admits that its enactment was regular and in ac cordance with the provisions of the defendants constitution and by the express terms of the contract between the plaintiffs husband and the defendant the former agreed to comply with all the laws rules and regulations now governing said conclave and benefit fund or that in the future may be enacted by the Supreme Con clave to govern the said conclave and fund Therefore the by laws regularly adopted by the defendant became retrospective as well as prospective in their operations except as to the rights which had become fixed and vested by the terms of the original contract In the original contract there was no mention of death by self destruction or suicide of a member whether sane or insane The demurrers to the pleas also admit that the plaintiffs husband was a suicide and the meaning of the word suicide is as defined by the Century Dictionary One who commits suicide at common law one who being of years of discretion and sound mind destroys him self and the act itself is defined by designedly destroying ones life To constitute suicide at common law the person must be of years of discretion and of sound mind But in addition to this definition there is a presumption of sanity which must be enter tained in the absence of proof Insanity cannot be predicated simp ly upon the act of selfdestruction for human experience has shown that sane men have taken their own lives To the extent that the bylaw provides for the forfeiture of contract rights in the event of suicide by the insured while he was sane it is valid first because it invades no vested rights of the insured and second because it is a fundamental though unexpressed part of the original contract that the insured should not intentionally cause his own death In asmuch as the original contract and bylaws were silent upon the subject of suicide by the insured while sane the new bylaw is valid because there can be no such thing as a vested right for a sane man to commit suicide and for the further reason that it is nothing more than the written expression of the provision which the law had read into the contract at its inception Therefore inasmuch as the demurrer admits that the plaintiffs husband was sane at the time of the commission of the suicide the court is of the opinion that there can be no recovery except in accordance with the terms 44 MayPLUNKETT V IMP ORDER HEPTAO8PH8 of the bylaws of the association and therefore the court sustains the demurrer to plea No 1 and overrules the demurrer to plea No 2 and will enter an order that the sum of 33334 be paid to the plaintiff in this case and that the plaintiff shall pay the costs of this proceeding In this case it is not necessary to express an opinion as to whether or not the bylaw in question is binding upon those members who afterwards became insane and committed suicide and as to such persons no opinion is expressed There is eminent authority to the effect that such a bylaw is not binding on them Weber v Supreme Tent K of M 172 N Y 490 Sarah Shipman v Pro tected Home Circle 174 N Y 398 63 L R A 847 And much authority to the contrary Supreme

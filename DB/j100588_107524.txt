J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107524,AN ESSAY TOWARDS THE CALCULUS OF FUNCTIONS PART II,I206971,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS XI AN ESSAY TOWARDS THE CALCULUS OF JUNCTIONS PART II BY C BABBAGE ESQ COMMUNICATED BY W H WOLLASTON M D SEC R S READ MARCH 14 I816 IN A FORMER PAPER WHICH THE ROYAL SOCIETY HONOURED WITH A PLACE IN THE LAST VOLUME OF THEIR TRANSACTIONS I ENDEAVOURED TO EXPLAIN THE NATURE OF THE CALCULUS OF FUNCTIONS AND I PRO POSED MEANS OF SOLVING A VARIETY OF FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS CON TAINING ONLY ONE VARIABLE QUANTITY MY SUBSEQUENT ENQUIRIES HAVE PRODUCED SEVERAL NEW METHODS OF SOLVING THESE AND MUCH MORE COMPLICATED FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS AND HAVE CON VINCED ME OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CALCULUS PARTICULARLY AS AN INSTRUMENT OF DISCOVERY IN THE MORE DIFFICULT BRANCHES OF ANA LYSIS NOR IS IT ONLY IN THE RECESSES OF THIS ABSTRACT SCIENCE THAT ITS ADVANTAGES WILL BE FELT IT IS PECULIARLY ADAPTED TO THE DISCOVERY OF THOSE LAWS OF ACTION BY WHICH ONE PARTICLE OF MATTER ATTRACTS OR REPELS ANOTHER OF THE SAME OR OF A DIFFERENT SPECIES CONSEQUENTLY IT MAY BE APPLIED TO EVERY BRANCH OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY WHERE THE OBJECT IS TO DISCOVER BY CALCULATION FROM THE RESULTS OF EXPERIMENT THE LAWS WHICH MDCCCXVYI B BMLR BABBAGEBS ESSAY TOWARDS REGULATE THE ACTION OF THE ULTIMATE PARTICLES OF BODIES TO THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THESE DESIRABLE PURPOSES IT MUST BE CON FESSED THAT IT IS IN ITS PRESENT STATE UNEQUAL BUT SHOULD THE LABOURS OF FUTURE ENQUIRERS GIVE TO IT THAT PERFECTION WHICH OTHER METHODS OF INVESTIGATION HAVE ATTAINED IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO HOPE THAT ITS MATURER AGE SHALL UNVEIL THE HIDDEN LAWS WHICH GOVERN THE PHENOMENA OF MAGNETIC ELECTRIC OR EVEN OF CHEMICAL ACTION WHEN FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS CONTAINING TWO OR MORE VARIABLES OCCUR THEIR SOLUTION PRESENTS STILL GREATER DIFFICULTIES THAN THOSE WE HAVE ALREADY CONSIDERED THE NEW RELATIONS WHIC ARISE NECESSARILY REQUIRE A NEW NOTATION TO DISTINGUISH THEM I SHALL ENDEAVOUR AS FAR AS I AM ABLE TO APPLY OR EXTEND THAT ALREADY IN USE BUT AS IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE IN THE INFANCY OF A CALCULUS TO FORESEE THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT MAY BE CARRIED OR THE NEW VIEWS WHICH IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO TAKE OF IT THE NOTATION I HAVE USED SHOULD ONLY BE CONSIDERED AS OF A TEMPORARY NATURE IT MAY BE EMPLOYED UNTIL SOME MORE CONVENIENT ONE BE DEVISED PERHAPS HOWEVER IT MIGHT BE MORE ADVANTAGEOUS THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE ALTERED UNTIL OUR ACQUAINTANCE WITH THIS SUBJECT BECOMES MORE INTIMATE AND UNTIL THE INFINITELY VARIED AND COMPREHENSIVE RELATIONS DIS PLAYED IN THE DOCTRINE OF FUNCTIONS HAVE BEEN MORE MINUTELY EXAMINED IF 4 BE THE CHARACTERISTIC OF ANY FUNCTION OF TWO QUANTITIES X AND Y THAT FUNCTION IS THUS DENOTED A X Y NOW IF IN STEAD OF X IN THIS QUANTITY THE ORIGINAL FUNCTION BE SUBSTITUTED I SHALL CALL THE RESULT THE SECOND FUNCTION RELATIVE TO X AND I SHALL DENOTE IT THUS  X 2Y  X AY  I8OTHE CALCULUS OF FUNCTIONS 181 THE FIRST INDEX A REFERS TO X AND THE SECOND INDEX I REFERS TOY SIMILARLY IF INSTEAD OF Y IN THE ORIGINAL FUNCTION THE FUNCTION ITSELF HAD BEEN SUBSTITUTED THE RESULT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SECOND FUNCTION RELATIVE TO Y IT WOULD BE THUS DENOTED 2XY  X4 XY IF THERE ARE MORE THAN TWO VARIABLES IN THE ORIGINAL FUNCTION THEY MAY BE ARRANGED IN THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY ARE TO BE OPE RATED ON AND THE INDICES WILL DENOTE THE NUMBER OF OPERATIONS TO BE PERFORMED THUS 23I14 X Y Z V SIGNIFIES THAT IN THE FUNCTION 4XY Z V WE MUST INSTEAD OF X SUBSTITUTE THE FUNCTION ITSELF AND IN THE RESULT INSTEAD OF Y PUT THE SAME FUNCTION THIS LATTER OPERATION MUST BE REPEATED AND FINALLY INSTEAD OF V IN THE LAST RESULT PUT THE ORIGINAL FUNCTION THIS LAST OPERA TION MUST AGAIN BE REPEATED TWICE THERE ARE MANY CASES WHICH THIS NOTATION DOES NOT COM PREHEND IF FOR EXAMPLE IN THE FUNCTION JUST PROPOSED WE WISHED AGAIN TO TAKE THE FUNCTION RELATIVE TO X ORY IT WOULD NOT BE EASY TO EXPRESS THIS  THE METHOD I PROPOSE IS TO HAVE TWO RANKS OF INDICES THE LOWER ONE TO DISTINGUISH THE QUANTI TIES OPERATED ON  THE UPPER ONE TO MARK THE NUMBER OF OPE RATIONS PERFORMED ACCORDING TO THIS METHOD THE EXAMPLE JUST CHOSEN WOULD BE WRITTEN THUS 2 3 I 4 1 2 3 4 4XY V IF ONLY SUCH FUNCTIONS AS THESE OCCUR WE ENCUMBER OUR SYM BOL WITHOUT ANY ADVANTAGE IF HOWEVER WE NOW WISH TO PER FORM ANY FARTHER OPERATIONS SUCH FOR INSTANCE AS TO TAKE THE SECOND FUNCTION RELATIVE TO Z AND THEN THE THIRD RELATIVE TO Y BB2MR BABBAGES ESSAY TOWARDS WE HAVE A VERY CONVENIENT MODE OF DOING IT THESE OPERATIONS WOULD BE THUS EXPRESSED 2 3 I 4 2 3 I 2 3 4 3 2 AXYV THIS NOTATION MAY NOT APPEAR SUFFICIENTLY CONCISE TO THOSE WHO DO NOT CONSIDER THE VERY COMPLICATED RELATION EXPRESSED BY THE ABOVE WRITTEN SYMBOL IT NEED HOWEVER ONLY BE USED IN VERY FEW CASES AND WHEN THE LOWER SERIES OF INDICES IS OMITTED IT MUST ALWAYS BE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE QUANTITIES THEMSELVES ARE ARRANGED IN THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY ARE TO BE OPERATED ON IF IN A FUNCTION OF TWO VARIABLE  XY WE TAKE THE SE COND FUNCTION RELATIVE TO X AND THEN THE SECOND FUNCTION RELA TIVE TOY WE HAVE XY  C  X I XYA J XY IF WE TAKE THE SECOND FUNCTION FIRST RELATIVE TO Y AND THEN THE SECOND RELATIVE TO X WE SHALL FIND XY XY  XAYYY IT APPEARS FROM THIS THAT THE ORDER IN WHICH THESE OPERATIONS ARE PERFORMED IS NOT IMMATERIAL AS THE ORDER IN WHICH WE DIF FERENTIATE A FUNCTION OF TWO VARIABLES IS IN THE DIFFERENTIAL CAL CULUS THE TWO EXPRESSIONS JUST GIVEN ARE THE TWO SECOND FUNC TIONS OF 4 XY THE FIRST TAKEN RELATIVE TO X AND Y AND THE SECOND TAKEN RELATIVE TO Y AND X BUT THERE MAY BE ANOTHER SECOND FUNCTION OF 4 X Y WHICH WILL ARISE FROM SUBSTITUTING AT THE SAME TIME 4 XY FOR X AND  XY FOR Y IT WILL BE  XY XY 182THE CALCULUS OFFUNCTIONS 183 AND MAY FOR THE SAKE OF DISTINCTION BE CALLED THE SECOND SIMUL TANEOUS FUNCTION RELATIVE TO X AND Y IT DIFFERS FROM THE TWO PRECEDING ONES AND IN ORDER TO DENOTE IT WITH BREVITY I SHALL PUT A LINE OVER THE TWO INDICES THUS 21 2 XY  A  XY XY THIS METHOD OF DISTINGUISHING IT IS EQUALLY APPLICABLE WHEN THERE ARE MORE VARIABLES THERE IS ONLY ONE OTHER MODIFICATION OF THE SYMBOL DENOT ING FUNCTION TO WHICH I SHALL AT PRESENT ALLUDE SUPPOSE AFTER ANY NUMBER OF OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN PERFORMED ON A FUNCTION OF TWO VARIABLES FOR EXAMPLE Y BECOMES EQUAL TO X AND THE RESULT ONLY IS GIVEN THIS WILL NATURALLY BE REPRESENTED IN A MANNER ANALOGOUS TO THAT IN WHICH EULER DENOTED THE LIMITS BETWEENWHICH THE INTEGRAL OF A QUANTITY IS TO BE TAKEN 2 2 THUS THE EQUATION I  2X Y FX Y  X ARISES FROM THE FOLLOWING QUESTION WHAT IS THE FORM OF A FUNCTION OF X AND Y SUCH THAT TAKING THE SECOND FUNCTION RELATIVE TO X AND THEN THE SECOND RELATIVE TO Y THE RESULT ON MAKING Y EQUAL TO X SHALL BE A GIVEN FUNCTION OF X  IT MIGHT BE PROPOSED THAT AFTER PUTTING Y EQUAL TO X THE WHOLE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED MERELY AS A FUNCTION OF X AND THAT ITS NTH FUNCTION SHOULD BE TAKEN ON THIS HYPOTHESIS AND THE RESULT ONLY SHOULD BE GIVEN SUCH OPERATIONS I WOULD DENOTE THUS 4  XY F  CYXJ OR PERHAPS   XYFXYX AND IN A SIMILAR MANNER ALL OTHER RELATIONS OF THE SAME KIND IMAY BE EXPRESSEDMR BABBAGES ESSAY TOWARDS I SHALL GIVE ONE EXAMPLE WHICH WILL ILLUSTRATE THESE VARIOUS MODIFICATIONS OF

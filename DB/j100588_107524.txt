j100588,Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London,107524,An Essay towards the Calculus of Functions Part II,i206971,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS XI An essay towards the calculus of Junctions Part II By C Babbage Esq Communicated by W H Wollaston M D Sec R S Read March 14 i816 IN a former Paper which the Royal Society honoured with a place in the last Volume of their Transactions I endeavoured to explain the nature of the calculus of functions and I pro posed means of solving a variety of functional equations con taining only one variable quantity My subsequent enquiries have produced several new methods of solving these and much more complicated functional equations and have con vinced me of the importance of the calculus particularly as an instrument of discovery in the more difficult branches of ana lysis nor is it only in the recesses of this abstract science that its advantages will be felt it is peculiarly adapted to the discovery of those laws of action by which one particle of matter attracts or repels another of the same or of a different species consequently it may be applied to every branch of natural philosophy where the object is to discover by calculation from the results of experiment the laws which MDCCCXVYI B bMlr BABBAGEBS essay towards regulate the action of the ultimate particles of bodies To the accomplishment of these desirable purposes it must be con fessed that it is in its present state unequal but should the labours of future enquirers give to it that perfection which other methods of investigation have attained it is not too much to hope that its maturer age shall unveil the hidden laws which govern the phenomena of magnetic electric or even of chemical action When functional equations containing two or more variables occur their solution presents still greater difficulties than those we have already considered the new relations whic arise necessarily require a new notation to distinguish them I shall endeavour as far as I am able to apply or extend that already in use but as it is almost impossible in the infancy of a calculus to foresee the extent to which it may be carried or the new views which it may be necessary to take of it the notation I have used should only be considered as of a temporary nature it may be employed until some more convenient one be devised perhaps however it might be more advantageous that it should not be altered until our acquaintance with this subject becomes more intimate and until the infinitely varied and comprehensive relations dis played in the doctrine of functions have been more minutely examined If 4 be the characteristic of any function of two quantities x and y that function is thus denoted A x y Now if in stead of x in this quantity the original function be substituted I shall call the result the second function relative to x and I shall denote it thus  x 2y  X Ay  i8othe calculus of functions 181 The first index a refers to x and the second index i refers toy Similarly if instead of y in the original function the function itself had been substituted the result would have been the second function relative to y it would be thus denoted 2xy  x4 xy If there are more than two variables in the original function they may be arranged in the order in which they are to be ope rated on and the indices will denote the number of operations to be performed Thus 23I14 x y z v signifies that in the function 4xy z v we must instead of x substitute the function itself and in the result instead of y put the same function this latter operation must be repeated and finally instead of v in the last result put the original function this last opera tion must again be repeated twice There are many cases which this notation does not com prehend If for example in the function just proposed we wished again to take the function relative to x ory it would not be easy to express this  The method I propose is to have two ranks of indices the lower one to distinguish the quanti ties operated on  the upper one to mark the number of ope rations performed According to this method the example just chosen would be written thus 2 3 I 4 1 2 3 4 4xy v If only such functions as these occur we encumber our sym bol without any advantage if however we now wish to per form any farther operations such for instance as to take the second function relative to z and then the third relative to y Bb2Mr BABBAGES essay towards we have a very convenient mode of doing it these operations would be thus expressed 2 3 I 4 2 3 I 2 3 4 3 2 Axyv This notation may not appear sufficiently concise to those who do not consider the very complicated relation expressed by the above written symbol it need however only be used in very few cases and when the lower series of indices is omitted it must always be understood that the quantities themselves are arranged in the order in which they are to be operated on If in a function of two variable  xy we take the se cond function relative to x and then the second function rela tive toy we have xy  c  x i Xya J Xy If we take the second function first relative to y and then the second relative to x we shall find xy xy  xAyyy It appears from this that the order in which these operations are performed is not immaterial as the order in which we dif ferentiate a function of two variables is in the differential cal culus The two expressions just given are the two second func tions of 4 xy the first taken relative to x and y and the second taken relative to y and x But there may be another second function of 4 x y which will arise from substituting at the same time 4 xy for x and  xy for y it will be  xy xy 182the calculus offunctions 183 and may for the sake of distinction be called the second simul taneous function relative to x and y it differs from the two preceding ones and in order to denote it with brevity I shall put a line over the two indices thus 21 2 xy  A  xy xy This method of distinguishing it is equally applicable when there are more variables There is only one other modification of the symbol denot ing function to which I shall at present allude Suppose after any number of operations have been performed on a function of two variables for example y becomes equal to x and the result only is given this will naturally be represented in a manner analogous to that in which EULER denoted the limits betweenwhich the integral of a quantity is to be taken 2 2 Thus the equation I  2x y fx y  x arises from the following question What is the form of a function of x and y such that taking the second function relative to x and then the second relative to y the result on making y equal to x shall be a given function of x  It might be proposed that after putting y equal to x the whole should be considered merely as a function of x and that its nth function should be taken on this hypothesis and the result only should be given Such operations I would denote thus 4  xy f  CyxJ or perhaps   xyfxyx and in a similar manner all other relations of the same kind imay be expressedMr BABBAGES essay towards I shall give one example which will illustrate these various modifications of the original functions 23 2 213213 y ax 3 3 2 4 3 I y x  z v  fx L This equation contains the analytical enunciation of the follow ing Problem What must be the form of a function of four quantities i xy  v such that taking the second function relative to z the tliird relative to x and the second simultaneous one relative to y and v if in the result ax be put for y and j3 for v and the whole be then considered as a function of x and z and if on this hypothesis the third function be taken relative to z and the second relative to Z and if yx be now put for z and the third function of the expression considered merely as a func tion of x be taken then it is required that the final result shall be equal toJx a given function of x Symmnetrical functions I shall denote as in my former Paper by putting a line over the quantities relative to which they i I are symmetrical thus 4 x y z v is symmetrical relative to x and y in one sense and relative to z and v in another PROBLEM I Required the solution of the functional equation 4 xy  ax Gy To avoid repetition a P 3 c unless otherwise mentioned always express known functions and p tj x are unknown or arbitrary ones Put 4 xy p

y j t  we shall still only have one arbitrary function In fact the most general solution of the equation 4 xy      with which I am at present acquainted is  wy  irxyJ j and this only involves one arbitrary functionoMr BABBAGES essay towards PROBLEM II Given the same equation A xy ax 3y  Suppose one particular solution of this equation is known let it befx y then take 4 x y qf x y qp being perfectly arbitrary and the given equation becomes Pf xy qf ax y which is evidently satisfied sincef y f rx y  by the hypothesis Ex i Let  xy  lXy one particular solution of this equation isfxIy  xz0g hence the general solution is 4 xy  xlogY Ex 2 Given the equation A xy   sxyn a particular case isf x y  log hence the general solution is   y q log Ex 3 Given the equation  x y  4 xnym In order to get a particular case let us put xy  log x  a log2y by substituting this value we shall find that it is a particular solution of the equation if a  lo  hence the general solution of the equation is 1

if m   we have the same solution as in the first n In these equations the functions have contained the varia bles separated but it may frequently happen that they occur mixed as in the following Problems PROBLEM IIi Given the equation   Y  4 xy xy Assume 4 xy  f xyfxy and by making this substitution the equation becomes f XYfXY f  xJy xyJxyxy  In order to render this equation identical I determinef andf from the two following equations f xy  J yxy andf xy f a xy t xy From these it appears thatf andf are merely two particular solutions of the origillal equation If therefore we are ac quainted with any the general solution is 4 xy  pfxyfAY If only one particular solution is known the general one is X y  qf xy Ex i Let us examine in what cases we can find the general solution of the equation 4 xy  xny xkyr In order to obtain a particular solution put 4 xyxvyw and making this substitution we shall find the following equa tion of condition among the exponents i  n i r km 187 C c MDCCCXVIeMr BABBAGES essay towards hence either of the following equations may be solved genee rally d xy  xn r  r t Yr  YJ fY r X b the solution of the former is 4 xy  yj and that of the latter is t4 xy qp xrI yn I In a put n r then the solution of 4 x y   VXy vy is  xy  y Ina similar manner it may be found that the solution of xY  3 y  xyq 1 As another example take the equation a particular solution is  xy  xy y2 hence the gene ral solution is  x y    xy y  but w e may find ano ther particular solution of this equation which is totally diffe rent from the former and by combining the two we shall obtain a much more general solution The equation b will coincide with the one under consideration if we make n  and r  then we shall have for another particular solution f xy  y2X hence a very general solution of the equation 4xy 4 Vy v 2xy  is XYq  StYY  VI  p remaining perfectly arbitrary In the equation of this Problem it may happen that i88tie calculus offunctions c xy does not contain x nor A x y contain y it then be comes 4 Xy  y x This is the case when 4 xy is required to be a symme trical function of x andy the equation would then become xy  y x two particular solutions aref xy  xy andfxy  y hence the general solution of the equation is xy  y x y Though these solutions may with propriety be termed general because they contain an arbitrary function yet I am by no means inclined to think them the most general of which the questions admit possibly we ought to except the two last equa tions though I shall afterwards show that the solution of an equation of the form  xy 4 ax Ay may contain any number of known functions within the arbitrary one PROBLEM IV Given the equation x xy  a XY P X Y Assume as before  x y  J yfxy then the equation will become fxyfxy IfMxy xyf xy xy  In order to render this equation identical determinef andf from the two equations Jxy  J X y y xy andf x y f xy xy putting in the first of these xy for x and A y fory we find f axxyf  xyxy xy y      Cc2 189Mr BABBAGES essay towards and we should find a precisely similar equation for determin ingf If we are acquainted with two particular solutions of this equation we may from them derive the general solution of the given equation If however the functions  and  are of such a nature that the two following equations are fulfilled eq 1 becomes identical without assigning any particular value tof orf The two conditions are a Yo x y  x y and 3 xy xyy It may be curious to enquire whether we can discover any forms which will satisfy these equations for this purpose let us assume a xy a  bx  cy and also f xy  a  bxcy I I this will only lead us to a particular solution but I shall pre sently show that it may be rendered general If the two conditions already specified are fulfilled the arbitrary con stants will bedetermined and we shall have the following equations a xy  a  bx  b y ab 3xy b bx by which may be thus generalised Let  be any function and let 3x be the inverse of that function so that  x x then the conditions will be fulfilled if xy a  bP x  b 7  and x y a br b y Some remarks however are necessary on the inverse func tion p  If we combine x and constant quantities by any of the direct operations addition multiplication elevation of powers c the result which is called a function of x admits Igothecalculus offunctions only of one value let z equal the function then we have the equation z  x If from this we endeavour to discover the value of x in terms of z the operation is an inverse one and x admits of one or more values according to the nature of the operations denoted by o This number may even be infinite if m denotes an equation of the nl degree there are n values of x in terns of z It may then be enquired whether in using the substitution en Iployed in the latter part of this Problem any of these perhaps infinite number may be taken or whether only certain particular values should be used  without attend ingto this circumstance our conclusions may become erro neous all these different values will satisfy the equation px x but only those must be used which also satisfy the equation  xx thus if z px a xi we shall have x z Vi az if we employ the upper sign we have 4p   t  X  V  t  If we use the lowser one m z1  a a ts xxx x the upper sign must therefore be taken because in the latter part of the Problem we suppose  cpx x and p py y This remark which is of some importance extends to the conclusions in my former Paper and to the whole of the subsequent enquiries The equation 1 might be considered as similar to the original one and the same transformation might be performed en this and thus we might continue to deduce new conditions In the first part we found that the equation Ax  oax always admitted of an easy solution when ox  x and by continuing the substitutions already pointed out we should arrive at i9II9g Mr BArBBAIEs essay towards some conclusions very analogotus for functional equations of the form of those treated of in this Problem but the length to which these enquiries would lead render it sufficient merely to indicate them In the equations solved in Problem I and II it is obviously immaterial whether we first put ax instead of x and then in the result put 3y foi y or conversely but in the equation of Pro blems III and IV the case is different If in the function xy we put simultaneously a xy for x and G xy fory the result will be different from that which would arise from first putting s xy for x and then in the result putting 3 x y for y or from inverting this operation the three results stand thus X j Xy a 4  x xy 3 x y b  X Ili XY k Xnj b  xy3 o tyy c TiLesc three functions are evidently different and in the solu tions of the Problems regard was only had to the first of them which may be called the simultaneous function Those however of the second and third class might occur and it becomes necessary to point out the means of solution wliich are applicable to them According to the notation laid down these functions may be thus expressed 4 I xy xy a B   t x tr niy b B2 Ii Xy t ny c But to avoid the trouble of indices I slall show how those ofihe calculus ofjfunctions the second and third class may be reduced to those of the first I shall therefore always consider finctions of the first order as simultaneous ones and omit tlhe indices which if supplied would be    c I I To transform 4t a x y xy into a function whose index is  put a x x y  x y then 1 I I I  i x y y   t aXy xy and similarly if 1 o xy 3 xy y xy we should have x II I 2  Xy  f X y     y y   and generally whatever be the number of variables a similar transformation might be effected PROBLEM Vo Required the solution of the equation xy  A xyj z x xyY Assume 4 xy Jxy  f xyf y and sub stituting this in the given equation we find fxy  fXyfxy   A xyf  xy xy x f xy xyf  y1xy This equation will be satisfied if we are acquainted witli par ticular solutions of the three following equations fxy A xyf axy 2xy f xy ftxy e P Ty andfx yf a MTtxy the first of these is nothing more than the original equation 1931Mr BABBAGES essay towards If therefore we know one particular solution of the original equation and also one or two particular solutions of the other equation we may deduce the general solution of the Problem Ex Let xy yy x in this casefxy fy x and two particular solutions are 1 1 Jxy  qy and fxy  3 y also a particular solution of the given equation isfxy   hlence its general solu tion is 2y 7 x y xy PROBLEM VI Given the equation xy AA xy xiy t Y   B y  Suppose we are ac uainted with one particular solutiou which satisfies the equation and let it befxy then assume 4 xy fxy  q xy and making this substitution the equation becomes f xy  p xy Ax yf

of the function 4 xy such that it shall not alter its form by the simultaneous substitution of xy 3 xy for x and y and generally that it shall re main the same when for x and y are respectively substituted any of the functions denoted by a x y and A xy The n conditions which determine 4 may be thus expressed AP y  a xy y x y Y xy  c Assume  xy fx yfxyy 1 then from the first condition we have  fyfJy   fMxy xyfx xyxy this will be satisfied by making fxy f  xy 3  xy and fxy f axy xy  these are two particular solutions of the first equation The second condition is 4 x y   x y  y x l which becomes Cxlyf xy  fa y Xy fx xy xy 2 wheref andf are known functions make f y a3 y  K xy andfy AiyK xy X I 1 K and TK are therefore also known functions MDCCCXVI 195 D dig6 Ir BABBAGES essay towards Asstume qp y  fvyfx y then equation 2 v CxyAxyG Jyfy  f fKxy Kxy K y K y  This equation must be solved in the same manner as the for ner by means of two particular solutions and by continuing zte same 1neithod we shall find that theform of the function i may be determined by means of 2n particular solutions of certain fuictional equations when there are n pair of conditions assigned A less general solution may however be found when we are only acquainted with n particular solutions A similar method would lead us to the form of 4 whatever might be the number of variables If however we are ac quainted with any number of particular solutions which remain the same in all the cases assigned by the conditions of the Problem we may have the general solution by making  f3tff 11f ff f being it i particular solutions i  Ex Let it be required to find a symmetrical function of I x x the equations to be satisfied are I 2 n A    4 X   1  X X C I  n 3 na 3 4 n I  or the whole of the conditions may be more concisely denoted by the expression I e 3 n We may easily find n partscular solutions which fulfill these equations for in the first place it is evident that the sum ofthe calculus off unctions 197 any number of quantities is symmetrical with respect to them therefore fXI    t  OG  c   G  S X I x z  I n I Again the sum of their products two by two is also sym metrical therefore f sc c   to   t  t C  S x  2 I i t I 3 t13 x and similarly the suns of their products three by three four by four c are symmetrical We may therefore find n dif ferent particular solutions and the general solution will be any arbitrary function of all these particular solutions or  9 i f S Scm  YS  c Instead of taking for particular solutions the sum of all the quantities the sum of all the products by twos the sum of all the products by threes c c we might have employed the sum of all the quantities the sum of their squares the sum of their cubes c but the solution thus deduced would not be essentially different from the former On functional equations of the second and higher orders iivolving two or more variables The notation to be employed in these enquiries has already been sufficiently explained and the different species of second functions have been noticed Preserving the same symbols let it be required to solve the following Problem PROBLEM VIII Given the equation  XI Y t This equation though apparently involving two variables D dc 2Mr BABBAGE essay towards may in fact be solved by the methods of the first part fory may be considered as a constant quantity and if in the solution of xs x Probs 9 1o and 14 Part I we put arbitrary functions of y instead of the constant quantities which occur we shall have a solution of the given equation thus a parti bx cular solution of x x isf x  C instead of c put  y then a solution of the given equation is b Ap   X for 2 I  b x y  xy  3 xyy X  bYx3 IXX We might also instead of b put any other arbitrary function of y and the result will be the same The equations A xy  y and r xy  a y may be treated in a similar manner in the firsty must be con sidered as constant and x munst be so treated in the latter In general when functions are taken only relative to one of the variables the rules delivered in my former Paper are sufficient for their solution such is the equation F Xy 4 xy 2CyY   Xy  It might however occur that though the order of the function does not vary relative to the other variable yet that that vari able may occur in different forms in each function An example will render this more evident a 3 c being known functions let F y  yt t ty   dt3o 1 y n J x vy t o here though the functions do not vary in order relative toy 198the calcuzls of Jfzctions 199 yet they do vary in a certain sense because y is differently contained under each functional characteristic the method of treating these kind of equations will be explained hereafter PROBLEM IX Given the functional equation QG1yo This signifies that the second simultaneous function is equal to zero It is evident that xy or y x will be a particular solution for if 4 xy  x y we have 34 y  xy Ay  x   y0 By observing the process just gone through it appears that it would equally succeed if for x we putf x and for y we pultfy for if  xy fx fy we have 2 y  jI fy  fx fy  o This solution is con siderably more general than the former yet is by no means the complete solution a more general one may be obtained thus we found one particular solution to be 4xy  y now if we multiply the right side of this equation by an arbitrary function of x and y the condition will still be fulfilled for if  xy  xy qp xy we shall find y  xy  x y qy x  y p y xy q y  o provided p  y p y x y xy  does not contain in its denominator any factor which vanishes2Mr BABBAGES essay towards PROBLEM X Given the equation 2 y a In this case the second simultaneous function of x and y is constant The first solution which presents itself is  xy y  A then we shall find 2 2xy   y  A y   A  A a therefore Aa and one particular solution is  xy   y a This may be rendered more general nearly in the same manner as thelast Problem thus let yxy x y  a then  2j y  y p x y  a  x  y  x y  a x p  q Q jY  acjYc Y a aa Anotbher particular solution which readily occurs is Ax   A L this gives  x y  A Y A a y therefore A  a and a particular solution is PY z  or  y y this readily points out another general solution let 4xyAp  henCe42 2 y A  A  a nake A  and the general solution is itY i oa f xi From the conmbination cf the two preceding solutions we 200ite calculus offunctions 201 may obtain another value of Iwhiclh will also satisfy the given equation it will be axjWy  1   This on trial will be found to agree with the condition and X p and p are arbitrary functions The equation we are considering will also be satisfied by making i xy a  or more generaily by the constant quantity a multiplied by any fraction wiose numrator and denominator become equal when x is put Ifr  suc are te following xTy x  C x Vx3  8y Y 3 2j a Y3 1 a ax v PROBLEM XI Given the equation xy ax  by Assume  y y p  qy then we have t  y  p px  g qyq   q p  q p qy and 33 y pq px  qy and generally  y p qm p  qy hence p p  qf a and q p  q Z b which gives for the values of p and q a b P nr I a andq n I abj  b b This is a very limited solution not containing even an arbi trary constant it might easily be rendered more general butMr BABBAGEP essay towards the problem itself would scarcely have been worth noticing had it not been for the very curious results to which it led me The relation between  x y  px  qy and  x y p  qfI p qy is very remarkable it appears from this that in the present case in going from the ntb to the n1  1tb simultaneous function we have only to multiply by the sum of the coefficients of the original function On enquir ing a little more minutely into the cause of this circumstance it will be found that it depends on the original function con taining x and y of the same dimensions in all its terms or Inore generally that the expression of x y is homogeneous Let us now assume some homogeneous function and examiwe its second and higher simultaneous functions let 4j xy ax  byP  y    c the second simultaneous function is 22x ya x yl tb x Yn c x y c or 2xy  xy  abcc  1  a If we now take the simultaneous third functions we have 33 y 1  2 zy    C ll  y henc  t33xy 3 l 1    ny n Repeating the same operation we should have I  l  n n 44 4 y4 1 1 X y and generally kz kI i n  c n tRy JcVy nX 11  ki kI  yX 4i1n b XY x I n 202the calculus of fuctions This elegant property of homogeneous functions will assist us in solving a variety of equations PROBLEM XII Given the equation nn    5  y a xy Determine n from the equation bn and also determine Ik I i i from the equation 4i  1 1   a Or the given equation will be satisfied by any homogeneous I function of the degree indicated by bk provided the suml of k Ib all its coefficients is equal to the quantity a  Ex Let 4 33Qy  8  xy4 here b 4k 3 therefore n n2b4 and n  I also a 8 and 1 1 83  therefore any of the following quantities will satisfy the equa tionl 2X  x y y Y1y2Y2 tio0 2 j c  Y2 zy  ye x2  y  9y The properties of homogeneous functions are so nearly connected with the solution of equations containing simulta neous functions that it will be convenient to examine into them a little farther and to adopt some means of denoting them with brevity In order to signify that a function of several variables has in each of its terms the sum of the indices of any two of them always the same I shall make use of a line placed beneath those two variables thus   y signifies an homogeneous function of x and y and AMDCCCXVI E e o0324iM BABBAGES essay towards as it may be convenient also to denote the sum of the two itdices I shall place it underneath on the outside of the parenthesis thus thien thle expression  a y denotes any q homogeneous function of c and y of the qth degree A func tion of three variables  y and z may be homogeneous with respect to two of them x and y in one sense and also rela tive to y and z in another but it does not from thence follow that it will be homogeneous relative to all three such a func tion would be denoted thus 4x yz P q a particular case of this expression is x z  x3yz xy z This notation being premised we have the f6llowing theorems relative to lhornogeneous functions fyx 1 1 C Xn 1 ki ki n kXyn  Xyn x l 1 And generally if we have any homogeneous function of the nth degree and instead of x and y we substitute any other func tion whatever as  y y then we shall have the following equation  Xy Xy P1 x4aY 3 I I n n  x      Assume y y  q T X Ym call the latter member for the sake of brevity K and take the second simultaneous function on both sides  in this case cxy will become a i i K by eq 3 and for the same reason y  will become 3 i i K and consequently we shall have 20othe calculus of functions   ZQ  K nK m t nn  rN  4 let i   1 i and also let m n then this equation becomes 42 2 y 1 this affords another and a more direct solution of Prob i o for if x2 xya a general solution is P  Y P 1 Xy  r 1 i being equal to i i this latter condition however is not absolutely necessary and if we wish to avoid it the general solution will be y  Xy 7 l 1 TYnj P I the following is another solution of the same

I am inclined to think that this solution is not the most general of which the Problem admits even though the series were continued back as it might to negative powers of x and y The two solutions which follow are possibly more general although on this point I am not certain It would indeed be a very important step if we could assign the number and nature of the arbitrary functions which enter into the com plete solution of functional equations Another solution of the equation 2 2x y a may be thus deduced let x  m  Y  Y c K then taking the secondl simultaneous function on both sides it will be perceived by the construction of the second side of the equation that y I     CJ tall the right side of the equation A then a ver y genesal oQ6the calculus offunctions solution of our equation is

resulting equations are by no means easy to solve and in a variety of cases it appears that they are contradic tory or impossible Let us apply this substitution to the equation of this Pro blem then since x y  cf px qy we have Pfxp xfI  y I p x j y Performing the operation denoted by p on both sides it becomes f2 X px Vp y f 2 p x py Put q x for x and  y fory then it becomes f2x xyzf2x y which is

particular solutions of the two following equations and have met with no success Z4 2 xy 4 xy and  yxy4 ixY Should however any particular case be found their general solutions flow immediately from the method just explained With regard to the equation of the Problem y xy   2zxj I have little expectation of finding any particular case as I think the following reasoning though perhaps not quite so satisfactory as might be wished will show the impos sibility of it First let us suppose that 4 xy is a symme trical function of x and y let it be X x y then our equation becomes xxyYx x Y X X yY X Comparing the first of these expressions with the third we may observe that in the first wherever X x y occurs the same quantity   3 also occurs in the third consequently in this respect the first and third are identical but wherever y occurs in the first x occurs similarly in the third therefore in this respect they cannot be identical unless y is equal to x From this it appears that the equation in question cannot be solved by any symmetrical function Again the given equa tion 2  IX   i 2  y contains x and y in the same man ner and no reason can be assigned why in the solution x should be contained differently from y this may perhaps be made more clear thus Letf x y be the quantity to which each side of the given equation is equal then  1 x y fx y  A1l 2 y Now since   x y y f x y and also x x y x y5 3l8the calculus offunctions f xy and since taking the second functions is a direct ope ration it is evident that the original function c x y will produce the same result whether we take the second func tion relative to x or relative to y therefore it must be simi larly composed of x and y that is to say it must be symme trical relative to x and y  but we have before shown that no symmetrical function can satisfy the equation consequently the equation is contradictory This train of reasoning I offer with considerable hesitation well aware of the extreme difficulty of reasoning correctly on a subject so very general and which from its novelty the mind has not been sufficiently habituated to consider so as to rely with confidence on any lengthened process of reasoning I thought it however right to mention this proof that those who may seek for particular cases might first enquire whether the equation be possible PROBLEM XXI Given the equation X  Xy y 4 xy

equations amongst the higher orders of functions another question presents itself which maybe thus stated What must be the form of a function of n variables such that taking the functions relative to any or to all of them any number of times and combining these quantities in any mazinner the result shall when all these variables are made equal to x be equal to a given func tion of x This question might thus be expressed when there are only two variables FV  y A y XzXyx2 I xy c a yx this condition obviously enlarges the signification of the func tion A and the solutions ought to be more general We shall accordingly find that some equations of which without this condition we cannot find even a particular solution are capa ble when it is added of very extensive ones When there are more than two variables the condition may be that making 224the calcul us of junctions them equal by pairs the result shall be given a particular case would be the equation F xyzvzwr4xy zvwrc F X r r   Instead of making y equal to x and z to v and so on y might become a given function of x and z a given function of v c thus F xyzvwr xyz vwrc F xvr z V a few examples will sufficiently explain the method to be pursued in treating these equations PROBLEM XXVIII Given the equation  2XZ t r 2 ty CYX This Problem of which without tile condition of y being made equal to x we could not find even a particular case readily admits of solution in its present state Since t Ly is only equal to X 2 xy when y  x we may put for the given equation IX y  y XY Ai 2 y l provided that when y is equal to x the latter side of the equation shall become I xy and this fully satisfies the condition of the Problem If therefore we can find such a value of 0 the equation   may be treated as a common functional equa tion

It is evident that particular values of p are xy  and  many others might be mentioned but it is desirable to deter mine cp more generally Since q xy z  z y  it is evident that p x z  z and since this is independent on any particular value of x we have q v v z  that is to say that whatever quantity is substituted for x if the same quantity is also substituted for y the result will be equal to z Now let v  cp xy z it becomes p qpxy Z P X Z Z  but this expression is nothing more than the second simulta neous function relative to x and y and may be therefore more concisely expressed thus 2 2 2I Xy z  z in which equation since it does not vary relative to x that quantity may be considered as a constant and the equation ap 2 2Xy  X constant being solved we have only to substitute instead of the various constant quantities arbitrary functions of z thus then the solu tion of the equation P xY CYX is reduced to that of 4 2 2 x y  constant and we have only to refer to Problem lo for its general solution Let us apply this to the solution of the equation of this Problem 42I x y  4 I2  y Cy  x Se6the calculus of functions take as a particular case of the equation p 2 Ixy z  z xy z y z then the equation of the Problem becomes Y  x y  I 2 xy or y 1 xy  x 42 xy this is the equation solved in Prob XXI therefore all its solu tions are also solutions of this equation This however is comparatively speaking but a very limited answer every different solution of the equation p2 2I x y z   furnishes a new solution of our Problem containing one or more arbi trary functions each of these may very

me thod of Prob VII Part I all functional equations of the first order may be reduced to this form  and although in many cases this reduction is very difficult or even in the present state of analysis out of our power yet it is theoretically pos sible and we shall therefore consider all equations as so reduced There is this remarkable difference between the former methods and the present one Those which I have already given always led to the general solution and perhaps in some cases to the complete one these on the contrary which I shall now propose always conduct us directly to a particular solution which does not contain even an arbitrary constant It has however several advantages it is the most direct method with which we are yet acquainted and if by any means we could introduce into these solutions an arbitrary constant it would afford us gene ral ones this is a step which is wanting to connect it with the former methods In the case of differential functional H h23o Mr BABBAGES

not apply when the given equa tion contains only the different forms of the function without the variable quantity itself thus it is not applicable to the equation F  Ax 0aX  a X   the reason of this is obvious for if we eliminate from this equation by means of the n equations which arise by chang ing the order in which the functions are placed all the func tions but x we shall have a result containing nothing but ix and constant quantities and therefore x is equal to a con stant quantity it is true such a value of Ax will satisfy the equation but it scarcely deserves the name of a solution Another exception is when the equation F x Jx 4 t c X cex  o is homogeneous relative to the different forms of the unknown function for in this case when we attempt to eliminate them they all disappear together leaving an equation of condition thus given 4x  a  x ox c and o x  x we have 4oax  a  ax t x  a  axg x and 4x a ax aax  4x or 1  ac  ax which equation is not necessarily true 23334

various orders of functions and their differentials may be reduced to those of the first order by the same means but great dif ficulties still remain it is by no means easy to discover par ticular solutions of the original equations and even when these are found the functional equations of the first order which remain to be solved are of considerable difficulty I shall therefore refrain from giving any more examples and pro ceed to show how functional equations involving definite inte grals may be reduced to those we have already treated Such equations might occur in a variety of curious and interesting enquiries few of which have yet been noticed DALEMBERT in one of the volumes of his Opuscules has examined a ques tion which may be referred to tis class it is the following Suppose a sphere composed of particles of matter what mustbe the law of attraction amongst these particles so that the force of the whole sphere acting on a particle at a distance may fol low the same law  the question might be varied by supposing the law to be given and the form of the solid to be required 341Mr BABBAGES essay towards but the general solution of such questions is by no means easy PROBLEM XXXVII Required the nature of the function 4 such that dx 4 x  Ca the integral being taken between the limits xo and xa Assume v x v such that X v   o v  v the form of p may be ascertained from this equation by means already described Then if we make fdxT i  cp  4a 1 it is evident that between the two limits x  o and x  a the integral will be reduced to 4a and we have therefore a diffe rential functional equation whose mode of solution has already been pointed out Other more complicated equations may be solved in the same way these I shall omit I shall however make some observations on this method of solution with a view to point out some questions of considerable importance In equation 1 the function indicated by p is so assumed that we may have  a Ja  o a a a from which perhaps it might be imagined that qc x a must contain only x a and constant quantities but the con dition would still be fulfilled if it contained 42a 43a or na which though not actually variable cannot strictly be regarded as constant To fix our ideas let us consider the example in this Problem one value of p x Ca is evidently qp x a  wa we have therefore Jdx x x a athe calculus of functions and by differentiating ni from which ix may be found This is a solution derived from a certain form attributed to p but we might also give to v the form p x Za  a  T xP af a   a and in that case the equation to be solved would be   a  d  a af a a a a  this contains only the second function of the unknown quan tity and must be solved as a second functional equation con sidering a a c a as constant quantities let its solution be 4x Fx a a  a a then we must put x and determine a from the equation a  Fa a a 4 4a the value of a thus deduced will furnish the values of 4a c oa and these being substituted in a will give the value of x  this solution is evidently of a different nature from the former and forms another species Again the following form of m will also agree with the conditions x x a  pa xPx agf aa  a   Xx  I xxkx  which being substituted in the Problem mx must be found from a functional equation of the khb order x must then be put equal to a and the new functional equation

point out the nature of other solutions yet more general which may be found for these and other similar Problems would far ex ceed the limits of a mere outline of the calculus I shall con clude my remarks on this Problem by stating the plan to be pursued in one particular case which may serve as a model for all similar operations Take as the form of q x a p z 4a  za  o oa a a then we have d X

 F x a fag a to o  1  we must now put xa and treat the resulting equation as one of the second order considering o and Vo as constants Let its solution be 4aFa F o ys0o s Now substitute o for a retaining o as a letter instead of making it actually zero there will result a new functional equation of the second order whose solution is oF o  and lastly substituting this value of to and also that of 3to which may be deduced from it in 2 we have the value of a from this a may be found and these being substituted in i give the value of x 244the calculus offunctions 245 PROBLEM XXXVIII Given

y may be found a certain number of arbitrary functions will be contained in this integral these must all be determined so as to satisfy the original equation Amongst the numerous questions to which the calculus of functions is applicable I shall select a problem proposed by EULER in one of the volumes of the Acta Acad Petrop as it will offer an example of a mode of treating of functional equa tions of a nature yet more general than those contained in this paper 5stthe calculus offunctions PROBLEM XLII Required the nature of a curve such that taking any ordi nate DB and drawing a normal at the point D the next ordinate CE raised at the foot of the normal shall be equal to that normal Let AB  x BD y and y  x be the equation of the curve then BC Y dx and DC vy   Yand by the condition of the Problem we have   l y  y yr    X  ydy haence   xd4i r xrd x T p  EXT3  d  zYd1 tx a This is apparently a very difficult functional equation and I am not acquainted with any direct method of solving other similar ones It is in fact only from a peculiar condition which this equation involves that any solutions have been obtained the condition to which I allude is that the quantity 4xd does

Problem may be found It ought however to be observedthe calculus offunctions that the constant quantity introduced by integration is not perfectly arbitrary it must be determined so as to make the equation between x andy fulfil the equatio a If for in stance we assum2 2 YY  to be equal to a yY we should find the equation of tlue curve to bo  a   c c being the constant tatroduced by integration

determining cthe equation e C 1o whence co and c 1 using this latter value we have a  l x y2sy2 which is the equation of the circle and it is obvious that this curve satisfies the conditions It is very necessary to attend to this mode of determiining the constants as we should otherwise meet in the solution with many curves which do not satisfy the conditions thus in the last example the curve is apparently an hyperbola but owing to the constant becoming imaginary it is in fact a circleGMr BABBAGES essay c To complete the outline of this new method of calculation it would be necessary to treat of equations involving two or more functional characteristics and to explain methods of eli minating all but one of them these lead to a variety of inte resting and difficult enquiries and will probably be of consider able use in completing the solutions of partial differential equa tions it would also be proper to consider the maxima and minima of functions and to apply to this subject the method of variations these are points of considerable difficulty and although I have made some little progress in each of them I shall forbear for the present any farther discussion on this subject In the mean time the sketch which I have offered and the few applications I have given are sufficient to point out the great importance of this method It should however be observed that its applications have only been noticed inci dentally my object has been to direct the attention of the analyst to a new branch of the science and to point out the manner of treating it the doctrine of functions is of so general a nature that it is applicable to every part of mathematical enquiry and seems eminently qualified to reduce into one regular and uniform system the diversified methods and scattered artifices of the modern analysis from its compre hensive nature it is fitted for the systematic arrangement of the science and from the new and singular relations which it expresses it is admirably

almost any other fungus The reasons for this are that under certain cli matic conditions it causes sudden and wide spread destruction of potato fields and also that though its life history has been carefully studied the sexual or oospore stage has never been surely found Berkeley who was one of the earliest investigators to have a rational view of the cause of the epidemic of 1845 wrote at the time as follows Few subjects have attracted more attention or have been more variously canvassed than the malady with which potatoes have been almost uni versally visited during the autumn of 1845 The press has teemed with notices the most contra dictory the attention of scientific men in every direction has been engaged by it and three at least of the principal governments of Europe have issued commissions to examine into its etiology and to discover if possible a remedy In 187576 at a time of considerable de vastations of potato crops in Europe by the fungus DeBary was employed by the Royal Agricultural Society of England to further investigate this fungus while at about the same time Worthington G Smith was en gaged in similar work for the Royal Horticul tural Society As the result of their endeav ors considerable was learned concerning the life history of the fungus Smith claimed to have found the oospores in the infested leaves and the old sets in great abundance and was awarded a gold medal by the Royal Horticul tural Society for his work These bodies had been observed as early as 1845 by Rayer IMon tagne and Berkeley DeBary did not succeed in finding what he considered oospores of this fungus and disputed Smiths claim with such good reasons that botanists generally believe that the oospores have never been discovered though once or twice since investigators have claimed without much conviction to have found immature oogonia At the time of the controversy DeBary said Ever since the oospores of a Peronospora were discovered innumerable researches have been made for those of Phytophthora I have myself looked for them for fifteen years and on every oppor tunity have searched for them in the stalks leaves flowers fruit and tubers of the potato In July of the present year 1875 when the fungus ap peared in this district in sad abundance I ob tained a very large amount of material for study and at the same time secured the kindly assistance of two botanists experienced in researches of this kind Dr Rostafinski and Dr Stahl But again only negative results were arrived at    That they will be regularly found somewhere or other is assured for our knowledge of the habits of numerous allied fungi make this more than prob able Smith deposited slides of his oospores with the British Museum Concerning these Mas see some time ago wrote me I have very carefully examined W G Smiths type slide preparation and am positively certain that the socalled oospores are nothing more thanMAY 12 1911 SCIENOcR 745 the globose thickwalled chlamydospores belonging to a Fusarium In a discussion following the Jones and Lutman paper at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting at Boston last year GUssow said that he had seen these slides and that the oospores much re sembled the bodies that Jones and Lutman had obtained in their artificial cultures The writer has not seen these slides though he tried to obtain examples of the oospores from Smith a few years ago Smith wrote at that time No doubt you know that the oospores became a kind of political subjectoospores of P infestans or not oospores of P infestans and I had no wish to go on Botanists and popular writers fol lowed what they took to be the safer authority just as Saccardo has done this is right enough in a way While we have not seen these slides on every possible occasion during the eight years that we have been studying this fungus we have looked for oospores in the leaves and tubers under the conditions described by Smith While we have never found spores that satis fied us that they were the potato blight oospores we have found oosporelike bodies both of animal and fungous origin that might be mistaken for such and possibly might be some of those bodies described by Smith We have seen Smiths drawings and his photomicrographs published in the Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science Vol 15 in 1875 and the drawings of Montagne pub lished by Berkeley in the Journal of the Horticultural Society Volume 1 in 1846 these latter being considered by Smith to represent the same thing he described as the oospores None of these impress us as being the same as the true oospores that we have obtained in cultures The only figures that at all show a resemblance are Figs 134 to 136 in Smiths book on Diseases of Field and Garden Crops published in 1884 We are in clined to believe that these botanists had a variety of things under consideration and while it is quite doubtful if any of them were the oospores of potato blight we do not wish to make a positive assertion without see ing the original preparations In 1904 we first began to study the potato blight in artificial cultures So far as we know we were the first to make such cultures in this country or at least to publish notes on them but in looking up the literature at the time it was found that two French botanists Matruchot and Molliard had secured cultures even earlier Their results published in 1900 and 1903 were similar to those we had ob tained viz the fungus was grown in certain media with fair success but no oospores ap peared though we did very rarely find curious shaped threads that might indicate futile at tempts to form oogonia At the Baltimore meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in December 1908 Jones and Giddings gave a paper in which they described these curi ously shaped threads which had appeared with more or less frequency in stab cultures of a specially prepared potatogelatin medium that they used Jones was inclined to believe that they were attempts at oogonial formation though there were no indications of antheridia or oospores At the same meeting the writer3 described a special medium Lima bean juice agar on which the potato blight grew with far greater vigor than on any medium yet tried so that its continued cultivation was as easy as that of any parasitic fungus On this medium however no oospores appeared and very rarely even the curiousshaped threads though when Phytophthora Phaseoli a near relative was grown on it oospores appeared in profusion At the Boston meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science Jones and Lutman gave a second paper in which they further discussed these curious bodies that appeared in their cultures Though not stating positively that these bodies were of the nature of oogonia they were inclined to consider them as resting spores While much Conn Agr Expt Sta Rept 1905 2 SCIENCE XXIX 271 February 12 1909 8Conn Agr Expt Sta Rept 898

while these bodies showed a still greater modifica tion toward the oogonial type they did not succeed in producing in their cultures any bodies of the nature of antheridia During the past year the writer with the aid of his assistant Mr E M Stoddard has made still further tests with four strains of potato blight obtained from different sources and with two of these really one as the other traces back to the same potatoes one season later has obtained results far beyond anything yet reported These results were primarily due to the use of a new medium which gave us for the first time very definite attempts at oospore formation and with a cer tain modification of this medium absolutely perfect oogonia antheridia and even oospores have been obtained We have not been suc cessful as yet in producing the oogonia in cultures in anything like the abundance of those of Phytophthora Phaseoli and Phytoph thora cactorvium in the same medium and very few of the oogonia produce even partially ma ture oospores but of their nature there can be absolutely no doubt Whether or not we can perfect their formation in greater abundance remains to be seen but recently from an un usually good culture a temporary slide prepa ration showed over a hundred of these oogonia mostly without oospores or with im mature ones whereas last March the most we could find in similar slides were half a dozen or less From the results of our recent investigation there is no doubt that the curious threads and bodies that Jones and the writer to a much less extent previously obtained were attempts at the formation of oogonia We should judge however that Joness cultural media except for one particular were not suited to perfect these bodies further and that theex cretory markings he obtained on the cell walls were largely abnormal From my in vestigations it can be stated that the oogonia of the potato blight ate thickwalled with a more or less roughened or ornamented ex ternal coat due to excretory thickening of the original wall and are tinted more or less a chestnut brown The oospores are moderately thickwalled smooth and colorless The oogonia are of a quite different type from those of both P Phaseoli and P cactorum which are similar The oogonia and oospores of these two are somewhat smaller than those of P infestans but the chief difference is their smooth hyaline thinwalled oogonia Not only has the writer obtained the oospores of P infestans in pure cultures but he has also succeeded in raising what he con siders crosses of this fungus with both P Phaseoli and P cactorum by inoculating a testtube of the special medium with P in f estans at the top and one or the other of these two species below With the growth of the two colonies together there appear in the vicinity of the P infestans colony not only the oospores of the other fungus but also oospores of the P inf estans type These oospores of the P infestans type so far appear only rarely in the crosses with P cactorunm which however have only recently been made In the crosses with P Phaseoli the oospores of the P infestans type are more abundant than they have ever yet appeared under the most favorable conditions in pure cultures of P inf estans and many of them produced per fect oospores On the whole the oogonia and oospores appear to be somewhat larger and less deeply tinted than those from the pure cultures of P infestans Crosses between P infestans and P Phaseoli made last March still continue to produce oospores of the in festans type not usually as abundant as those of the Phaseoli type however though these cultures have been renewed six times since their original crossing These descendants are not from the oospores since they never germinate in the cultures From the data at hand it looks as though there were not two strains male and female of the potato blight as we suggested some time ago but that the potato fungus had largely lost its power to reproduce itself sex ually This loss may have come about by propagating it year after year asexuallyMAY 12 1911 SRIENGR 747 through its hibernating mycelium in the potato tubers just as the potato itself has largely lost its power to reproduce sexually through the formation of seeds This loss of sexual power is shown in different degrees by the different strains of the fungus in artificial cultures The fungus seems to lose first its power of producing antheridia and then of producing oogonia Under favorable condi tions attempts to form oogonia first appear and under still more favorable conditions the antheridia are produced and with the forma tion of these the oospores also appear in more or less perfect form A further discussion of this subject with photomicrographs of the sexual stages as we have gradually developed them will appear in the next report of the Connecticut Agri cultural Experiment Station G P CLINTON NEW HAVEN CONN  December 20 1910

PROFESSOR E W RETTGERS review of my  Analytical Mechanics which appeared in number 995 issue of SCIENCE gives a wrong impression of my treatment of the principles of dynamics The reviewers criticisms are directed mainly against my claim of having based the science of mechanics upon a single dynamical principle Starting from certain premises which can not stand close examination Pro fessor Rettger arrives at the conclusion He makes more assumptions than are usually made in elementary textbooks of mechanics Let us consider the main points of his crit icisms in detail and see whether the foregoing statement is based upon facts On page 16 he introduces the conception of force as an  action and without hesitation applies vector addition to a system of forces What is he doing here but assuming the  parallel ogram of forces in its most general form It is intimated here that the parallelo gram of forces  is a dynamical law which I have  assumed  without formally introducing it as a new law It is a fact that I have applied vector addition to forces without hesitation but I have shown as little hesita tion in treating velocities accelerations tor ques linear momenta and angular momenta as vectors Why did not Professor Rettger ac cuse me of having assumed the parallelo grams of these magnitudes Is the paral lelogram of forces more of a dynamical law than the parallelogram of torques for in stance The parallelogram law applies to any vector and is not at all a characteristic of forces therefore it is not a dynamical law It does not even deserve being called a law when applied to a special type of vectors In its most general form the  parallelogram law  is the principle of the independence of mutu ally perpendicular directions in space a purely geometrical principle A special case of it is known to students of plane trigonometry as the law of cosines In the first chapter of my book this principle is given in its most gen eral form as well as in its several special forms and is applied to vector magnitudes of different types After devoting an entire chapter to vector addition and after defining force as a vector to introduce the paralello gram of forces as a new law as Professor Rettger would have it could serve only to show that the man who did it could not have a clear conception of the meanings of the terms he was using On page 102 he assumes that a force is propor tional to the acceleration produced This as sumes Newtons second law This statement is not quite right The rela tion between force and acceleration which I have called forceequation is derived on page 106 from the fundamental principle which I have postulated In this derivation I have made use of the definition of kinetic reaction which is stated and illustrated on pages 102 to 105 but this is not equivalent to assum ing a new principle Will Professor Rettger claim that to define the terms used in a prin ciple is equivalent to introducing or assum ing new principles Suppose I had based my work upon the principles of the conserva tion of energy and of the conservation of momentum should I have no right to classify and define the different forms of energy and of momentum without being rightly accused of having introduced new principles Will Pro fessor Rettger consider the definitions of mo mentum of potential energy and of kinetic 507N S VoL XXXIX No 1005 energy as principles and state that mechanics can not be based upon the principles of the conservation of energy and of momentum alone  What about the law itself The first part of the law is clear To every action there is an equal and opposite reaction is nothing but New ton s third law of motion The word  or leads us to think that the second part means the same thing as the first part IIad Profesor Rettger examined my book with greater care he would have noticed that I have used the term  reaction  in a slightly different sense and that with this difference the first part is not at all Newtons third law but has the same meaning as the  second part and that the two parts are only two different forms of the statics principle Further he would have seen that the first form is not made use of the entire work being based upon the second form alone and would not have charged me of having assumed Newtons third law in addition to the one I have introduced The first form is left out entirely in the papers which I published on the subject1 In one of these papers I have even shown that Newtons third law is a direct consequence of the second form I have postulated the following principle which I have called the actionprinciple The sum of all the actions to which a body or a part of a body is subject at any instant vanishes A  0 Then I have classified and defined the different forms of action On this principle I have based my treatment of mechanics and claim that I have given it a degree of unity and logical continuity which is not common to treatments of elementary mechanics This is made possible by the simplicity and flexi bility of the actionprinciple which is easily grasped by the beginner yet conveys a depth 1 On a Progressive Development of the Prin ciples of Mechanics

dynamical phenomena as it is shown in my recent paper on the subject2 H M DADOURIAN YALE UNIVERSITY A NEW METHOD OF COOPERATION AMONG UNIVERSITIES IN April 1910 was formed at Kansas City Missouri the Missouri Valley Conference of Ieads and Governing Boards of Universities The Conference embraced however only the institutions up to that time belonging to the Missouri Valley Conference for athletic pur poses There have been many conferences and associations of professors of universities and presidents of universities or both and there have been conferences of school boards representing the public schools in various cities but this is probably the first attempt on the part of university governing boards to accomplish a general understanding and co operation in regard to matters affecting insti tutions similarly situated The conference arose over the matter of intercollegiate foot ball the question so fruitful of controversy and discussion The reason for the conference was as follows There had been introduced into the board of regents of the University of Kansas a resolution abolishing intercollegiate football The vote was a tie and the motion was lost The question was brought up again and after thorough discussion it was agreed by the board of regents of the University of Kansas that it was unwise to attempt to settle that question in one university alone and that all of the universities of the then existing Missouri Valley Conference through their heads and governing boards should be asked to meet in a general conference at Kansas City in April 1910 It was at the time of large and pointed discussion and criticism of intercollegiate football and after the matter had been clearly laid before the institutions most interested all of them accepted the invi 2Loc cit 608

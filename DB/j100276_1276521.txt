nothing in law is so apt to mislead as a metaphor  and if the remark is applied to branches of the law the principles of which are fully developed and abundantly illustrated by decided cases it is doubtless very true But the historian of law who looks at the efforts of the courts to create these principles by the expansion and adapta tion of a few narrow remedies will not be inclined to undervalue the use of the metaphor or analogy when used to give effect to the requirements of public policy and with a due regard to the claims of the technical logic appropriate to the system in which it is employed A very cursory acquaintance with the Year Books will illustrate this point The lawyers constantly used the analogies to be derived from the rules applicable to one class of writ to maintain the argument which they were urging as to the law applicable to proceedings under another class of writ2 Thus as I have elsewhere pointed out the real actions were the most highly developed class of actions in the mediaeval common law and therefore we often find that analogies derived from them or rules of law first applied in reference to them are when necessary extended by analogy to other classes of action3 Still more often do counsel in search of an argument use these analogies and to us who look at their arguments from the point of view of the settled modern law and not from the point of view of the period when this law was still in the mak 1 Per Lord Westbury Knox v Gye 1872 L R 5 H of L at p 676 2e g Y B B 2 Ed IV Mich pl 8 6 Hy VII Mich pl 4 pp 8 and 9 per

carried out on a great scale by COKE in his Commentary on LITrLE TON and in his Reports and on the whole he and others of his contemporaries very skillfully adapted by this method much of the medieval law of the Year Books to modern needs5 It is my object in this paper to call attention to one particular case in which this argument from metaphor or analogy has had a large influence on the development of our law I hope to show that an analogy derived from the action of Debt was one of the means used to so extend the action of Assumpsit that it became an effective means of enforcing all kinds of simple contracts land that some of our modern difficulties in relation to the doctrine of consideration arise from the fact that these extensions of Assumpsit were based not on strictly logical grounds but upon arguments derived from analogy or metaphor The nature of the action of Debt is well known6 The limitations of its scope and its procedural defects made it a very unsatisfactory form of remedy for the enforcement of contractual obligations Nevertheless in its application to the contract of sale of goods there had been in the course of the fifteenth century an important devel opment As a rule the quid pro quo needed to support an action of Debt must be something actually given or done But in the case of a contract for the sale of goods it had come to be recognized that the agreement to pay was sufficient quid pro quo for the agreement to deliver On such an agreement the vendor could bring Debt for the price and the purchaser could bring Detinue for the goods7 And as I have elsewhere pointed out8 this extension in the scope of the action of Debt is probably the origin of the rule that in English Law a contract of sale passes the property in the goods It was this ex tension of the action of Debt which I hope to show had a certain amount of influence on the action of Assumpsit During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the judges of the 4

284 348DEBT ASSUMPSIT AND CONSIDERATION common law courts were trying to evolve an adequate remedy for the enforcement of simple contracts and their ingenuity was sharpened by the knowledge that if they did not succeed in their quest the Chancellor would undoubtedly absorb the lions share of the jurisdiction over this important branch of law For it was clear ly contrary to equity as understood in the sixteenth century9 that men should be allowed to break their contracts as they pleased The precise manner in which the Chancellor would have filled this wide gap in our law if the common lawyers had not succeeded in their quest is still to some extent a matter of conjecture But we may hope shortly to learn something definite on this matter from the researches of Mr Willard T BARBOUR formerly of Oriel Col lege and now of the University of Michigan who has written for his B Litt degree in this University a very able thesis on this very subject I hope that he will shortly publish the results of his re searches into the records of the Court of Chancery which bear on this question and that he will go on to fill by like researches the gap in our knowledge of the history of equity from the earliest times till the reports begin at the end of the sixteenth century But the nature of the principles which the Chancellor would have applied if the common lawyers had not found an adequate remedy is a matter rather of historical and academic interest than of practical importance for he did not have the chance of applying them The development of Assumpsit filled the gap and filled it adequately Equity only interfered as the dialogue of the Doctor and Student explains when the law was inadequate or unfair 0 and therefore in the course of the sixteenth century the Chancellor accepted the theory of contract developed by the common law and only interfer ed as BROOK notes when the common law remedy of damages was insufficient This development of Assumpsit into an action which would ef fectually enforce simple contracts involved two great extensions In the first place it was extended so as to cover a mere nonfeasance as distinct from a misfeasance in breach of an undertaking and in the second place it was extended so as to cover the breach of a wholly executory contract i e to the case where neither party had as yet done anything in performance of his agreement The first extension was made during the second half of the fif 9 For some account of the place which equity filled in the minds of lawyers of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries see an

teenth century It is quite clear from the cases that the judges in order to justify it technically made use of the analogy presented by the action of Debt brought upon a contract for the sale of goods One of the earliest of these cases was an action by a purchaser of land who had paid his money against the vendor who failed to carry out his side of the contract One of the arguments used to justify the grant of an action of Assumpsit in this case of nonfeasance was this analogy derived from the action of Debt A vendor of goods it was said has Debt on an agreement to sell goods and a purchaser Detinue on an agreement to buy goods Similarly a vendor has debt on an agreement to sell land if he has conveyed the land but as the purchaser has not got Detinue he must be given an action on the case12 This case was really the foundation of a line of cases which laid it down that if one person has paid money or incurred any other detriment on the faith of a promise made to him he can sue by action of Assumpsit13 Some of the judges indeed wished to push the an alogy further and to hold that just as an agreement to sell goods gave the purchaser the right to bring Detinue and the vendor the right to bring Debt so an agreement to buy land though the money was not paid would give rise to an action on the case But this really involved a circular method of reasoning What detriment could arise from the making of such an agreement except upon the hypothesis that the counteragreement was actionablewhich was the thing to be proved14 It was not till the middle of the sixteenth century that the judges began to incline to the belief that if a promise were made for a promise both promises could be enforced by action of Assumpsit and it was not till the end of the century that the principle was ac cepted as settled law Now it must be admitted that this extension did not owe so much to analogies derived from the action of Debt as the first extension But indirectly it owed something because if the first extension had not been made this second extension would not have been possible Probably the first development in this direction was made by the decision that a special promise by a debtor to pay his debt would allow the creditor to bring Assumpsit on this special promise15 This 12 Y B 20 Hy VI Trin pl 4 Holdsworth Hist Eng Law III 337339 11 Holdsworth Hist Eng Law

Legal Liability II 6i n I the principleDEBT ASSUMPSIT AND CONSIDERATION in itself was not a violent departure from principle because by hy pothesis the promisor is indebted i e the promisee has already in curred the detriment on the faith of which the promise to pay is made It is really the converse case to the earlier line of cases noted above The earlier line of cases decided that when money was paid or other detriment incurred on the faith of a promise and the prom ise was not fulfilled Assumpsit lay the later line of cases that where the undertaking was fulfilled so that a debt arose which debt was not paid a promise to pay this debt was actionable But if payment would give rise to an action when the promise on the faith of which the payment was made was not fulfilled and if the fulfilment of the promise for which payment was expected would give rise to an action on a special promise to paywhy should not any promise be actionable if given for a promise The growing popularity of Assumpsit in which the promise was the gist of the action naturally brought this idea to the front and its intrinsic reasonableness coupled with considerations of public policy caused it to prevail16 But in Slades Case which marks the final victory of the principle because it was there applied even to those contracts on which Debt lay and even to cases where no special promise had been made we see again the old analogy based on action of Debt Just as the recipro cal grant of the right to the money and the right to the goods gives reciprocal actions of Debt based on these grants so the reciprocal promises of vendor and purchaser will give rise to reciprocal actions of Assumpsit based on these promises7 It is thus clear that analogies drawn from the action of Debt as applied to contracts for the sale of goods have had some influence upon the technical reasoning employed by the judges to justify their must be of later origin but as Brook died in 1558 the date when the point was decided cannot be far from the middle of the century and as Mr Street notes in another case abridged by Brook in the same title pl o05 dated 33 Hy VIII the principle seems to be admitted 16 Ames Issays in AngloAmerican ILegal History III 313 n 2 and Street op cit 55 n 6 cite Pecke v Redman 1555 Dyer II3a as the earliest case in which effect was given to a purely executory contract and the case seems to be so treated by Coke in Slades Case 1602 4 Rep at p 94b but it does not appear from the report in Dyer whether or no the contract had not been partly performed however the case of Strangborough v Warner 1588 4 Leo 3 is quite conclusive and it was quickly followed by other cases in which the same point was adjudged see for these cases Street op cit 55 n 8 17 Every contract executory imports in itself an assumpsit for when one agrees to pay money or to deliver anything thereby he assumes or promises to pay or deliver it and therefore when one sells any goods to another and agrees to deliver them at a day to come and the other in consideration thereof agrees to pay so much money at such a day both parties may have an action of debt or an action on the case on assumpsit for the mutual executory agreement of both parties imports in itself actions upon the case as well as action of debt 4 Co Rep at p 94a 35IMICHIGAN LAW REVIEW extensions of the action of Assumpsit But analogy even when close is not logic and though from the point of view of public pol icy these extensions were most beneficial it would be difficult to maintain that they were in all respects strictly logical More espe cially was this so in the case of the extension which allowed that Assumpsit would lie upon a promise if made in return for a counter promise Naturally when the conditions precedent for la success ful action of Assumpsit were generalized under the term Considera tion when lawyers began to speculate upon the nature of Consider ation and to lay down the rules to which it must conform difficul ties I as to the essential qualities of a valid consideration and 2 as to the practical application of the doctrine began exactly at those points at which this logical hiatus occurred i It has been too hastily assumed that the essence of consider ation is always some detriment incurred by the promisee upon the faith of the promise made to him18 But as Mr STREET has clearly shown this generalization will not apply to purely executory prom ises Where the consideration is only promise for promise the making of the counter promise does not expose the promisee to any detriment unless the counter promise is actionable and the counter promise is only actionable by virtue of this positive rule of law that promise for promise is actionable19 It is commonly assumed says Mr STREET20 that in the bilateral contract the mutual promises are considerations for each other in the sense that the word consid eration bears when one speaks of the ordinary unilateral promise But this is a mistake The bilateral contract is not based upon con sideration in the sense of detriment but is based solely upon consent and when we say that mutual promises are considerations for each other we use the term consideration in the broad sense of reason cause or equivalent Mr STREET therefore proposes to divide considerations into three classes21 First detriment to the promisee second mutual promises and third legal duty or precedent debt Now it is clear that the first corresponds to the original scope of assumpsit as extended to remedy a nonfeasance while the second 1s In my History of English Law III 345 346 the point that the consideration of promise for promise cannot be brought under the head of detriment to the promisee is not quite clearly brought out but in the next volume in which I shall deal specifically with consideration I shall hope to remedy this 19 Op cit II io8 In order to sustain this view that each party incurs a detriment by promising it is necessary to assume that the promise creates a legal obligation for there can be no detriment where the promise is not binding The proposition in question therefore exhibits the weakness of reasoning in a circle 20 Ibid 57 21 Ibid 6i 352DEBT ASSUMPSIT AND CONSIDERATION and the third correspond to the further extensions of its scope to remedy purely executory contracts and cases which fell within the scope of the action of debt But I think that the third class can real ly be brought under the first The debt which the promisor had in curred to the promisee was consideration for the promise to pay whether that promise was express or implied because the payment or performance which constituted the debt was a detriment to the promisee On the other hand as I have said before I agree with Mr STREET that the consideration of mutual promises cannot be brought under this generalization 2 Again it is precisely at these same two points that the most debatable questions in the practical applications of the doctrine of consideration have arisen a If a precedent debt is a valid con sideration for a subsequent promise will any past act beneficial to the promisor be a valid consideration  b If a promise for a prom ise is a valid consideration will a promise to perform or the actual performance of something that the promisor is legally liable to per form be a valid consideration  a As early as I56822 the distinction between a past act which will be a good executed consideration for a subsequent promise and a past act which cannot be connected in any way with the subsequent promise and cannot therefore be consideration for it was clearly perceived The court drew a clear distinction between a past act done from a friendly motive without expectation of payment and an act done upon request The first was held to be no consideration the second a valid consideration23 and in I58524 the distinction was laid down in almost the modern fashion of RHODES J If he said25 one serve me for a year and hath nothing for his service and af terwards at the end of the year I promise him 20 pounds for his good and faithful service ended he may have and maintain an action upon the case upon the same promise for it is made upon a good consideration but if a servant hlath wages given him and his master ex abundanti doth promise him io pounds more after his service ended he shall not maintain an action for that Io pounds upon the 21 Hunt v Bates Dyer 272a 23 The facts were that As servant was arrested B the plaintiff and C friends of A bailed him out that As business might not suffer The master promised the plaintiff to save him from any liability and it was for breach of this promise that action was brought The Court held that no action lay because there is no consideration where fore the defendant should be charged for the debt of his servant unless the master had first promised to discharge the plaintiff before the enlargement and mainprize made of his servant for the master did never make request to the plaintiff for his servant to do so much but he did it of his own head 24 Sidenham and Worlingtons Case 2 Leo 224 25 At p 225 353MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW said promise for there is not any new cause or consideration pre ceding the promise Which difference says the reporter was agreed by all the justices It is clear that the judges have a clear appreciation of the difference between a past and an executed con sideration They do not confuse counsel by talking about an excep tion to the rule that past consideration is no consideration in cases where that past consideration has been conferred at the request of the promisee Rather they regard a promise made in return for some benefit conferred in the obvious expectation of reward as an executed consideration for the subsequent promise to pay Lord BowENS judgment in Stewart v Casey26 reproduces the spirit of these six teenth century decisions And this is not surprising Judges who had themselves had a hand in so moulding Assumpsit that it could do the work of Debt and in adapting the general term consideration to express the conditions under which Assumpsit would lie upon a simple contract were likely to have a clear notion upon a funda mental question of this kind which was likely to give rise to con stantly occurring cases They were likely to have a clearer idea upon this matter than some of their successors who having had time to forget the procedural basis upon which the doctrine of consideration rested supplied this gap in their learning by somewhat a priori views as to its nature and limitations27 b Upon the second of these two debatable questionsthe ques tion whether a promise to perform or the actual performance of something that the promisor is legally liable to perform is a valid con siderationtheir views were by no means so clear and partly be cause of this fact partly because of the rarity of cases of this kind this has been for many years the most uncertain of all the problems connected with the doctrine of consideration28 One point is how ever fairly clear It is pretty certain that a promise to perform something that the promisor was already legally liable to perform was regarded as a valid consideration Two cases one of I600 and the other of I616 are really conclusive on this point In the case of Sherwood v Woodward29 the plaintiff 26 1892 I Ch at pp 115 ii6The fact of a past service raises an implication that at the time it was rendered it was to be paid for and if it was a service which was to be paid for when you get in the subsequent document a promise to pay that promise may be treated either as an admission which evidences or as a positive bargain which fixes the amount of that reasonable remuneration on the faith of which the service was originally rendered 27 Below p 356 28 References to the literature on this subject will be found in Street op cit II II8 n 9 I 9 n I

defendant in consideration the plaintiff would deliver the said cheeses to his said son assumed that if the son did not pay for them then he would The son did not pay and the plaintiff suedon this promise In arrest of judgment it was moved that this was not any consideration for it is no more than what the law appoints to deliver that which he sold The Court overruled this objection and held the consideration valid In the case of Bagge v Slade30 Two men were bound in a bond for the debt of a third man the obligation being forfeited so that they both of them were liable to pay this the plaintiff here in this writ of er ror said to the other pay you all the debt and I will pay you the moyety of this again the which he paid accordingly and so made his request to have a repayment made to him of the moyety according to his promise which to do he refused Thereupon the plaintiff sued for the moiety and judgment was given for him Now it is reasonably clear that both these cases were cases of promise for promise It is clear in the first case that when the promise was made the cheese was not yet delivered and in the sec ond case that when the promise was made the money had not yet been paid For this reason no valid objections can be taken to the actual decisions in these cases A promise for a promise was clear ly a valid considerationwhy should not a promise to perform a duty by a third person legally enforceable be a good consideration for a counterpromise No exceptional rule excluding this particular kind of promise from the general rule that mutual promises are a valid consideration for each other can as Sir F POLLOCK has pointed out31 be produced Unfortunately in both cases the judges seemed to consider that the performance of the act rather than the promise to perform was the consideration In the first case GAWDY and FENNER said It is an ease to the bargainee to have them without suit There is a new act done by him upon this agreement and it is an ease to the vendee32 It is clear that they considered that the new actthe performance was a consideration They seem also to suggest that the benefit to the son was also a consideration which was really wholly inadmissable unless such benefit was also a detriment to the promisee In Bagge v Slade COKt C J said the parties own contract here should bind him he hath no remedy for the money paid but when this is paid here is a good assumpsit grounded upon a good consideration for repayment of the moyety of the plaintiff And again I have never 30 I6I6 3 Bulstr I62 31 Law Quart Rev XVII 421 32 Sherwood v Woodward Cro Eliza 700 355MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW seen it otherwise but when one draws money from another that this should be a good consideration to raise a promise33 It would seem that COKE was confusing the case where money had been paid in pur suance of a contract so that a debt was thereby created and an obli gation enforceable by Assumpsit incurred and the case where mon ey was paid to discharge an existing debt In other words to use Roman terms he was confusing the payment of money which created a mutuum with the payment of money which operated as a solutio34 This confusion of contract and quasicontract fostered both at Rome and in England by the similarity of the rem edy by which they were enforced came to have an unfortunate in fluence upon the doctrine of consideration35 The lawyers came to think that wherever Assumpsit lay a contract must be found and consideration must be present36 This led to much ingenuity in the manufacture of considerations and tended to obscure the real basis upon which that doctrine rested In fact it had no small influence in causing that confusion between moral obligation and considera tion for which some of the decisions of Lord MANSFIELD and his immediate successors are unfortunately distinguished37 As a matter of fact there are two good reasons why performance of an existing obligation must be regarded as contrary to the princi ples which governed even in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries the creation of a valid consideration In the first place the performance of an existing obligation is a past act from which no request can be implied and therefore no promise express or implied can be grounded on it38 In the second place such a performance is no detriment to the promisee 39 and that this was an essential part of a valid consideration was recognized in I58440 We can hardly expect that the generation of lawyers who had created the doctrine of consideration should be able to solve all the 833 3 Bulstr 162 84

found for the plaintiff because that here is not any consideration set forth in the bar by reason whereof the plaintiff should discharge the defendant of this matter for no profit but damage comes to the plaintiff by this new agreement and the defendant is not put to any labour or charge by it therefore here is not any agreement to bind the plaintiff 356DEBT ASSUMPSIT AND CONSIDERATION problems to which that doctrine gives rise That they did so much may well excite our admiration In truth the legal ability displayed by the lawyers of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries is as remarkable as the ability displayed by the seamen the statesmen the writers and the men of science of this period In many departments of law statesmen and lawyers succeeded with extraordinary skill in the difficult task of adapting mediaeval rules and remedies to modern needs with the minimum of violent change The manner in which they moulded the action of Assumpsit partly by logical extension partly by the skilful use of analogies derived from the action of Debt and partly by their own clear perception of the conditions un der which it was expedient to enforce agreements and the manner in which by generalizing the conditions under which that action lay they gave the common law an entirely original theory of con tractare perhaps the most striking illustrations of that power No doulbt they left some problems to their successors to solve and since those successors were often men who had forgotten or who ignored the procedural basis from which the doctrine of considera tion had been evolved they sometimes created more difficulties than they solved In more recent years the sounder knowledge of this branch of our legal history to which the lawyers of the United States have mainly contributed has restored to us the original basis upon which the creators of that doctrine built The restoration has done more than anything else to settle modern doubts and to solve the problems which must arise in any system which bases its law of contract upon this doctrine I hope that the readers of this paper will not consider that this attempt of the writer to state in his own way some of the results of the work of such distinguished legal historians as AMES POL LOCK and STREET is superfluous That I have added anything very new to a branch of legal history which has been fully discussed from many points of view I cannot claim But as I know from experience to state old facts in a new way sometimes helps the learner If I have done this my object will have been achieved W S

J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107266,CONTINUATION OF EXPERIMENTS FOR INVESTIGATING THE CAUSE OF COLOURED CONCENTRIC RINGS AND OTHER APPEARANCES OF A SIMILAR NATURE,I206964,XVII CONTINUATION OF EXPERIMENTS FOR INVESTIATING THE CAUSF OF COLOURED CONCENTRIC RINGS AND OTHER APPEARANCES OF A SIMILAR NATURE BY WILLIAM HERSCHEL LL D F R S READ MARCH 23 I809 IN THE FIRST PART OF THIS PAPER I HAVE POINTED OUT A VARIETY OF METHODS THAT WILL GIVE US COLOURED CONCENTRIC RINGS BETWEEN TWO GLASSES OF A PROPER FIGURE APPLIED TO EACH OTHER AND IT HAS BEEN PROVED THAT ONLY TWO SURFACES NAMELY THOSE THAT ARE IN CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER ARE ESSENTIAL TO THEIR FORMATION IT WILL NOW BE NECESSARY TO ENLARGE THE FIELD OF PRISMATIC PHE NOMENA BY SHOWING THAT THEIR APPEARANCE IN THE SHAPE OF RINGS HAS BEEN OWING TO OUR HAVING ONLY USED SPHERICAL CURVES TO PRODUCE THEM 35 CYLINDRICAL CURVES PRODUCE STREAKS AM SOON AS IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THE CAUSE OF THE FIGURE OF A LY CERTAIN PRISMATIC APPEARANCE MUST BE LOOKED FOR IN THE NATURE OF THE CURVATURE OF ONE OR BOTH OF THE SURFACES THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO ITS PRODUCTION I WAS PREPARED TO EXPECT THAT IF A SPHERICAL CURVE WHEN APPLIED TO A PLAIN SURFACE OF GLASS PRODUCES COLOURED RINGS A CYLINDRICAL ONE APPLIED TO THE SAME WOULD GIVE COLOURED LINES OR STREAKS TO PUT THIS TO THE PROOF OF AN EXPERIMENT I GROUND ONE SIDE OF A PLATE OF GLASS INTO A CYLINDRICAL CURVE AND AFTER HAVING GIVEN IT A POLISH I LAID A SLIP OF PLAIN GLASS UPON IT AND SOON PERCEIVED A BEAUTIFUL SET OFDR HERSCHELS EXPERIMENTS FOR INVESTIGATING COLOURED STREAKS THE BROADEST OF THEM WAS AT THE LINE OF CONTACT AND ON EACH SIDE THEY WERE GRADUALLY NARROWER AND LESS BRIGHT THE COLOURS IN THE STREAKS WERE SIMILAR TO THOSE IN THE RINGS AND THEY WERE IN THE SAME MANNER CHANGEABLE BY PRESSURE AS IN THEM THEIR ORDER WAS LIKEWISE THE SAME IF WE RECKON FROM THE LINE OF CONTACT AS WITH RINGS WE DO FROM THE CENTER SO THAT THESE STREAKS DIFFERED IN NO RESPECT FROM RINGS EXCEPT IN THEIR LINEAR INSTEAD OF CIRCULAR ARRANGE MENT WHEN THE CYLINDRICAL SURFACE WAS LAID UPON A PLAIN SLIP OF GLASS THE SAME STREAKS WERE SEEN AS IN THE FORMER EXPERI MENT THEY WERE OF A LIVELY RED AND GREEN COLOUR AND I SAW AT LEAST TEN ELEVEN OR TWELVE ON EACH SIDE OF THE LINE OF CONTACT METALLINE SURFACES HAD THE SAME EFFECT FOR WHEN THE CYLIN DRICAL SURFACE OF GLASS WAS LAID ON A PLAIN METALLINE MIRROR I HAD RED ORANGE YELLOW GREEN AND BLUE STREAKS IN THE SAME MANNER A PLAIN SLIP OF GLASS PLACED UPON A POLISHED PART OF A BRASS CYLINDER OF AINCH IN DIAMETER PRODUCED ALSO COLOURED STREAKS THE COMBINATION OF TWO CYLINDRICAL SURFACES HAS AN EFFECT ON THE STREAKS WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH THE CONTACT OF TWO SPHERICAL ONES HAS ON THE RINGS FOR WHEN I PLACED THE CYLINDRICAL SURFACE OF GLASS LONGITUDINALLY UPON THE POLISHED PART OF THE BRASS CYLINDER THE STREAKS WERE CONTRACTED AS RINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN BY THE APPLICATION OF TWO SPHERICAL CUR S TO EACH OTHER S6OTHE CAUSE OF COLOURED CONCENTRIC I INGS 36 CYLINDRICAL AND SPHERICAL SURFACES COMBINED PRODUCE COLOURED ELLIPTICAL RINGS THE THEORY WHICH SUGGESTS TO US THAT THE PARTICULAR FIGURE OF EVERY PRISMATIC APPEARANCE BETWEEN GLASSES DEPENDS ON THE CURVATURE OF THE SURFACES WHICH ARE IN CONTACT IS STILL FARTHER CONFIRMED WHEN SPHERICAL AND CYLINDRICAL CURVES ARE APPLIED TO EACH OTHER FOR THESE ACCORDINGLY SHOULD GIVE EL LIPTICAL RINGS AND WHEN I TRIED THE EXPERIMENT BY LAYING A E6INCH DOUBLE CONVEX LENS UPON THE CYLINDRICAL SURFACE OF MY PLATE OF GLASS IT PRODUCED A COLOURED ELLIPTICAL CENTRAL PART EN COMPASSED WITH GRADUALLY VANISHING RINGS OF THE SAME FIGURE BY CHANGING THE FOCAL LENGTH OF THE LENS I COULD ALTER THE PRO PORTION OF THE CONJUGATE TO THE TRANSVERSE AXES OF THESE ELLIP TICAL RINGS AT PLEASURE A LENS OF 55 INCHES GAVE ELLIPSES THAT WERE MUCH FLATTENED AND ONE OF 5 INCHES GAVE THEM NEARLY CIRCULAR 37 IRREGULAR CURVES PRODUCE IRREGULAR FIGURES THE MODIFYING POWER OF SURFACES MAY BE FURTHER ESTAB LISHED BY SUCH AS HAVE NO REGULAR FIGURE FOR THESE OUGHT TO GIVE IRREGULAR PRISMATIC PHENOMENA AND THIS WAS FULLY PROVED BY THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENT I TOOK A LARGE PIECE OF MICA WHICH HAD A VERY GLOSSY BUT IRREGULAR SURFACE AND WHEN A 34INCH DOUBLE CONVEX LENS WAS PLACED UPON A SMALL RIDGE OF IT SEVERAL PRETTY STRAIGHT STREAKS MIGHT BE SEEN BUT WHEREVER THE RIDGE WAS WAVING THE STREAKS WERE FOLLOWING THE SAME DIRECTION IN SOME PLACES THE MICA GAVE IRREGULAR COLOURED ARCS THAT WERE CONCAVE TO SOME DIS TANT CENTRE AND IN OTHERS THE VARIOUS CONTORTED FIGURES THAT MDCCCIX M M 26TS6 DR HERSCHELS EXPERIMENTS OR INVESTIGATING WERE TO BE SEEN EXCEEDED ALL THE IMAGINARY FORMS WHICH THE MOST INVENTIVE FANCY CAN PAINT THE FLEXIBILITY OF MICA ALSO GAVE ROOM FOR USING DIFFERENT DEGREES OF PRESSURE BY WHICH MEANS A CONTINUAL CHANGE OF FIGURE AND SUCCESSION OF PRISMATIC COLOURS WAS PRODUCED WHEN I LAID A PIECE OF THIS MICA UPON A CYLINDER AND PLACED A PLAIN SLIP OF GLASS OR DOUBLE CONVEX LENS UPON IT ALL ITS IR REGULARITIES WERE MODIFIED INTO DISFIGURED STREAKS WITH THE FORMER AND DISTORTED ELLIPSES WITH THE LATTER EXPERIMENTS OF A SIMILAR NATURE WERE MADE UPON THE IRRE GULAR SURFACE OF ISLAND CRYSTAL AND OTHER SUBSTANCES WHICH ALL GAVE THE SAME RESULT 38 CURVED SURFACES ARE REQUIRED FOR PRODUCING THE COLOURED AP PEARANCES AT PRESENT UNDER CONSIDERATION IT HAS ALREADY BEEN SEEN IN THE FIRST PART OF THIS PAPER THAT SPHEIICAL CURVES GIVE CIRCULAR RINGS AND I HAVE NOW SHOWN THAT CYLINDRICAL FORMS PRODUCE STREAKS THAT A COMBINATION OF SPHERICAL AND CYLINDRICAL CURVATURES GIVE ELLIPTICAL RINGS AND THAT ALL SORTS OF VARIEGATED COLOURED PHENOMENA ARE MADE VISIBLE BY SURFACES WHICH ARE IRREGULARLY AND VARIOUSLY CURVED THESE EXPERIMENTS PROVE IN THE FULLEST MANNER THAT THE CURVA TURE OF SURFACES IS THE CAUSE OF THE APPEARANCE AS WELL AS OF THE SLAPE OF THE COLOURED PHENOMENA WHICH ARE PRODUCED FOR IF WE CAN INVARIABLY PREDICT FROM THE NATURE OF THE CURVES WE EMPLOY IN AN EXPERIMENT WHAT WILL BE THE APPEARANCE AND FORM OF THE COLOURS THAT WILL BE SEEN IT CERTAINLY MUST PROVE THE EFFICACY OF THESE CURVATURES IN THE PRODUCTION OF SUCH PHE NOMENA THIS WILL RECEIVE ADDITIONAL CONFIRMATION IN THE FOL LOWING ARTICLE WHICH SHOWS THATTHE CAUSE OF COLOURED CONCENTRIC RZIGS 39 COLOURED APPEARANCES CANNOT BE PRODUCED BETWEEN THE PLAIN SURFACES OF TWO PARALLEL PIECES OF GLASS APPLIED TO ONE ANOTHER AS THE PRODUCTION AND MODIFICATION OF THE FIGURE OF THE COLOURED APPEARANCES THAT HAVE HITHERTO BEEN CONSIDERED HAS IN THE LAST ARTICLE BEEN ASCRIBED TO CURVED SURFACES IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO EXAMINE WHETHER SUCH PHENOMENA MAY NOT ALSO BE SEEN BETWEEN THE PLAIN SURFACES OF TWO PARALLEL PECES OF GLASS APPLIED TO EACH OTHER DIRECTLY IN CONTACT OR INCLINED TO WARDS EACH OTHER IN SOME CERTAIN EXTREMELY SMALL ANGLE THE LATER OF THESE CASES HAS ALREADY BEEN CONSIDERED IN TIE IST ARTICLE OF THE FIRST PART OF THIS PAPER WHERE I HAVE SHOWN THAT TWO PLAIN SURFACES LET THE ANGLE OF THE WEDGE OF AIR BETWEEN THEM BE AA SMALL AS YOU PLEASE WILL NOT GIVE COLOURED STREAKS I HAVE INDEED SEEN TWO THIN PLAIN PIECS OF GLASS WITH A SLIP OF PLATINA OF AN EXTRAORDINARY THINNESS BE TVEEN THEM AT ONE END TIED TOGETHER WHICH SHOWED SOME STREAKS NEAR THE PLACE WHERE THE GLASSES WERE IN CONTACT BUT WHEN I REMOVED THE THREAD THAT BOUND THEM TOGETHER THE STREAKS VANISHED WHICH PROVES THAT THE GLASSES HAD BEEN CON STRAINED AND THUS HAD PROBABLY ASSUMED SOME CURVATURE AT THE POINT OF CONTACT I HAVE ALSO TRIED TWO FLAT SURFACES OF GLASS WHICH WERE SO PERFECT THAT NO COLOUR COULD BE PERCEIVED UNLESS THEY WERE BY UNEQUAL PRESSURE SOMEWHAT DISFIGURED AND WHEN THAT WAS THE CASE ARGE FLASHY COLOURED APPEARANCES BECAME VISIBLE AND THEIR CONFIGURATION FOLLOWED VERY EVIDENTLY THE STRESS WHICH I LAID UPON THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE GLASSES IT IS HOWEVER UNNECESSARY TO DWELL ON PROOFS THAT STREAKS CANNOT BE SEEN WHEN TWO PLAIN PARALLEL PIECES OF GLASS ARE M M S264 DR HERSCHELS EXPERIMENTS FOR IZVESTIGATING APPLIED TO EACH OTHER AS IT WILL HEREAFTER BE SHOWN THAT WLEN THE INCUMBENT PLAIN GLASS IS NOT OF A PARALLEL THICKNESS CO LOURED PHENOMENA MAY BE RENDERED VISIBLE BETWEEN TWO PER FECTLY PLAIN SURFACES ALTHOUGH NO FORCE OR STRAIN SHOULD BE USED TO PRODUCE A FALLACIOUS CURVED CONTACT 40 OF THE PRODUCTION OF COLOURED APPEARANCES HITHERTO I HAVE ONLY CONSIDERED THE COLOURED RINGS WHICH SIR ISAAC NEWTON HAS POINTED OUT AND HAVE SHOWN AT THE END OF THE 28TH ARTICLE THAT NO MORE THAN TWO SURFACES ARE ESSENTIAL TO THEIR FORMATION IT HAS NOW ALSO BEEN PROVED THAT THE CONFIGURATION OF THE COLOURED PHENOMENA ARISES FROM THE CURVATURE OF ONE OR BOTH OF THE TWO ESSENTIAL SURFACES FROM THESE PRINCIPLES IT WILL BE SEEN THAT WE ARE TO DISTINGUISH BE TWEEN THE PRODUCTION OF THE COLOURS AND THAT OF THEIR CONFIGU RATION WVHEN PRODUCED BY THE EXPERIMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE CAUSE OF THE CONFIGURATION IS LAID OPEN TO OUR VIEW BUT THE PRODUCTION AND ARRANGEMENT OF THE COLOURS REMAIN TO BE INVESTIGATED THE LEADING FEATURE OF THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE COLOURS OF THE RINGS IS PRISMATIC THAT IS TO SAY THEIR ORDER IS RED ORANGE YELLOW GREEN BLUE INDIGO AND VIOLET IN ORDER THEREFORE TO ENTER MINUTELY INTO THE SUBJECT I SHALL HAVE RECOURSE TO SOME PRISMATIC EXPERIMENTS IT WILL BE NECESSARY HERE TO MENTION THAT THE PROPOSED ENU MERATION OF THE MODIFICATIONS OF LIGHT WHICH WAS INTENDED TO HAVE BEEN GIVEN IN THIS PART OF MY PAPER IS GROWN TO SUCH AN EXTENT BY THE NUMBER OF EXPERIMENTS I HAVE MADE UPON THE SUBJECT THAT ITS INTRODUCTION WOULD OCCASION A LONG INTER RUPTION OF THE PRESENT SUBJECT AND ALTHOUGH UNDOUBTEDLY THETHE CAUSE OF COLOURED CONCENTRIC RINGS ACTION OF BODIES AND SURFACES ON LIGHT WOULD BE BETTER UNDER STOOD IF ALL THE MODIFICATIONS WHEREIN COLOURS ARE PRODUCED HAD BEEN BEFORE US YET AS THE EXPERIMENTS I HAVE TO RELATE MAY BE MADE PLAIN EITHER BY REFERRING TO MODIFICATIONS THAT ARE SUFFICIENTLY KNOWN OR BY EXPLAINING WHAT IS NOT ALREADY FAMILIAR I SHALL POSTPONE THE INTENDED ENUMERATION TO SOME FUTURE OPPORTUNITY AND CONFINE MYSELF AT PRESENT TO A FEW RE MARKS RELATING TO THEM THE COLOURS CONTAINED IN WHITE LIGHT MAY BE SEPARATED BY REFLECTION AS WELL AS BY REFRACTION AND WHAT IS PERFECTLY TO MY PRESENT PURPOSE THE ORDER IN WHICH THE COLOURS THUS PRO DUCED ARE ARRANGED IS THE SAME IN BOTH CASES EACH OF THESE PRINCIPLES THEREFORE MAY CAUSE COLOURED APPEARANCES WHICH THE PARTICULAR FIGURE OF THE SURFACES WE USE WILL MOULD INTO DIFFERENT CONFIGURATIONS SIR ISAAC NEWTON FOR INSTANCE HAS SHOWN THAT THE RAYS OF LIGHT WILL BE SEPARATED BY WHAT HE CALLS A DIFFERENT REFLEXIBI LITY WHEN THEY FALL ON THE BASE OF A PRISM THE VIOLET BEING REFLECTED FIRST AND THE RED LAST BY THIS PROPERTY OF THE DIF FERENTLY COLOURED RAYS HE HAS EXPLAINED A VERY REMARKABLE PHENOMENON VVHICH IS THAT IN A PRISM WHEN EXPOSED IN THE OPEN AIR AND WHEN THE EYE IS PROPERLY PLACED  THE SPECTATOR WILL SEE A BOW OF A BLUE COLOURT FROM THE LITTLE THE AUTHOR HAS SAID OF THIS BOW IT MAY BE SUPPOSED THAT HE DID NOT EXA MINE IT FARTHER THAN WAS REQUIRED FOR HIS PURPOSE IT WILL THEREFORE BE NECESSARY TO ENTER MORE FULLY INTO THE SUBJECT T SEE THE ILLUSTRATION OF THE GTH EXPERIMENT IN THE FIRST BOOK OF NEWTONS OPTICS PAGE 46 T SEE THE I6TH EXPERIMENT IN THE SECOND PART OF THE FIRST BOOK PAGE 145 S6566 DR HERSCHE4LS EXPERIMENTS FOR NVE STIG TNG 41 PAITICULARS RELATING TO THE NEWTONIAN PRISMATIC BLUE BOW THE NEWTONIAN BLUE BOW MAY VERY CONVENIENTLY BE EXA MINED WHEN A RIGHT ANGLED PRISM IS LAID DOWN ON A TABLE BEFORE AN OPEN WINDOW THE EYE BEING THEN BROUGHT TO A CONVENIENT ALTITUDE AND PRETTY NEAR THE SIDE OF THE PRISM WE SEE IN IT A BOW WHICH FROM THE PREDOMINANT COLOUR MAY BE CALLED BLUE IT CONTAINS SOME GREEN FOLLOWED BY BLUE INDIGO AND VIOLET A VERY FAINT RED ORANGE AND YELLOW MAY ALSO BE PERCEIVED ABOVE THE GREENISH COLOUR BUT THESE BELONG NOT TO THE BLUE BOW AND HAVE NOT BEEN NOTICED BY THE AUTHOR THEIR APPEARANCE WILL HEREAFTER BE ACCOUNTED FOR TO ANALYSE THIS BLUE BOW MORE PARTICULARLY LET US ADMIT THAT THE COLOURS WHICH GIVE IT THE GENERAL APPEARANCE OF WHAT MAY BE CALLED BLUE CONSISTS OF HALF THE GREEN AND OF ALL THE BLUE INDIGO AND VIOLET RAYS WHICH ARE REFLECTED WHILE THE OTHER HALF OF THE GREEN THE YELLOW ORANGE AND RED ARE TRANS MITTEN D THEN THE ANGLE OF OBLIQUITY AT WHICH THIS SEPARATION OF THE COLOURS WILL HAPPEN IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE DIFFERENT REFRANGIBILITY OF THE DIFFERENTLY COLOURED RAYS ASSIGNED BY NEWTON WILL

TRANSMISSIONS WHICH MUST HAPPEN BETWEEN GY Y  AND E ARE EXPRESSED BY THE LETTERS OVER THE BASE FOR THE FORMER AND UNDER IT FOR THE LATTER THE ORDER OF THE COLOURS OF THE BLUE BOW WHEN IT IS SEEN AT H IS PERFECTLY EXPLAINED BY THE LETTERS IN THE REFLECTED PART AND THE EYE MUST BE PLACED FOR SEEING IT AT THE MEAN OBLIQUITY BETWEEN THE ANGLES A A G AND E GC WHICH IS 49 57 3 IN ORDER TO CONFORM THIS ACCOUNT OF THE BLUE BOW TO THE MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS VIEWED BY NEWTON I HAVE PRESERVED HIS WAY OF ASCRIBING THE SEPARATION OF THE RAYS TO ETHIR DIFE RENT REFLELXIBIIITY WHICH HOWEVER IS MERELY THE EFFECT OF THEIR  THERE IS A MISTAKE IN ONE OF THE ANLGLES GIVEN BY NEWTON WHEN IN HIS OPTICS PAGE 45 HE EXPLAINS THE BLUE BOW FOR 49 DEG  TAKEN FRON SO DEG G MIAKES THE BREADTH OF THE BOW I 4 314

INVESTIGATINZG DIFFERENT REFRANGIBILITY THE ANGLES AT WHICH THE RAYS THAT CONSTITUTE THE BLUE BOW ARE SEPARATED FROM THE REST MAY VERY PROPERLY BE CALLED CRITICAL AND THE EFFECT WHICH IS THE CONSE QUENCE OF THE OBLIQUE INCIDENCES THAT HAVE BEEN GIVEN MAY WITH EQUAL PROPRIETY BE CALLED A CRITICAL SEPARATION OF THE DIFIE RENTLY COLOURED RAYS OF LIGHT 42 ACCOUNT OF A PRISMATIC RED BOW I MUST NOW INTRODUCE A PRISMATIC APPEARANCE WHICH ON AC COUNT OF ITS SIMILARITY WITH THE NEWTONIAN BLUE BOW FROM WHICH IT ONLY DIFFERS IN COLOUR I HAVE CALLED A PRISMATIC RED BOW IT CONSISTS OF RED ORANGE YELLOW AND SOME GREEN RAYS AND THE RED COLOUR BEING UPON THE WHOLE VERY PREDOMINANT IT MAY NOT IMPROPERLY BE CALLED A RED BOW IT IS NOT PRODUCED BY THE NEWTONIAN DIFFERENT REFLEXIBILITY OF THE DIFFERENTLY CO LOURED RAYS OF LIGHT BUT OWES ITS ORIGIN TO A MODIFICATION WHICH TAKES EFFECT AT THE OUTSIDE OF THE PRISM AT VERY OBLIQUE ANGLES OF INCIDENCE AND MAY BE CALLED A DIFFERENT INTROMISSIBILITY BUT THIS LIKE THE NEWTONIAN DIFFERENT REFLEXIBILITY IS ONLY THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE DIFFERENT REFRANGIBILITY OF LIGHT TO SEE THE RED BOW AN OBSERVER SHOULD PLACE HIMSELF IN NE OPEN AIR AND STANDING WITH HIS BACK WITHIN A FEW FEET OF SOME WALL OR BUILDING HOLD THE SIDE OF AN EQUILATERAL PRISM FLAT OVER HIS EYES AND LOOK UPWARDS TO AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT O0 AT THE HEAVENS HE WILL THEN SEE A BEAUTIFUL ARCH OF A DEEP RED COLOUR SUCCEEDED BY A BRIGHT ORANGE AND YELLOW WITH A CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF GREEN ON THE INSIDE THE COMPARATIVE DARKNESS OF THE BUILDING BEHIND WILL SHOW THE LIGHT IN FRONT TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE IT IS ALSO TO BE OBSERVED THAT ALLIEE CAUSE OF COLOZTRED CONCENTRIC RINGS A9 EXPERIMENTS ON PRISMATIC BOWS SUCCEED BEST WHEN THE HEAVENS ARE TOTALLY OVERCAST WITH AN UNIFORM CLOUDINESS TO ANALYZE THE PRODUCTION OF THIS BOW LET A B C DE FIG 2 PLATE XII BE RAYS OF LIGLIT MOVING IN AIR IN SUCH DIRECTIONS AS TO FALI ON THE EXTERIOR BASE FG OF A PIECE OF GLASS UPON THE POINTS  CYTS THE N IF IT BE REQUIRED THAT THESE RAYS AFTER THEIR IN TROMNISSION INTO THE GLASS SHOULD MEET IN THE POINT H AND FORM THE RED BOW THE ARGLES A A H B P H CY H D H D AND EE H MUST BE RESPECTIVELY EQUAL TO 130G 9

175  AND 556 505 NOW BY THE LAWS OF THE DIFFERENT REFRANGIBILITY OF LIGHT THE RED RAYS ARE INTROMISSIBLE AT O WHEN BY REFRACTION THEY IMAKE THE ANGLE IH F 49 30 264  BUT THE ORANGE CANNOT BE IN TROMITTED ANY WHERE BETWEEIN AND P WVITH ANY EFECT ON THE RED BOW SINCE IT IS ONLY AT 13 WHERE THE ANGLE H G F IS 49 G E18 THAT THEY CAN ENTER THE GLASS SO AS TO CO ME TO THE EYE AT H THE YELLOW RAYS WILL FOR THE SAME REASON BE EFFICIENTLY INTROMRITTED ONLY AT Y WHERE THEY WILL MAKE THE ANGLE H Y F 49 38 23 AND THE BRIGHTEST HALF OF THE GREEN RAYS WILL FIND AN EFFICIENT ENTRANCE FRONM S TO E SINCE THE SMALLEST ANGLE OF THEIR INTROMISSION H F IS 49 43 43 AND THE ANGLE HE F WHICH TERNMIATES THE RED BOW IS 49 46 I 5 THE ARRANGE MENT OF THE COLOURS OF THIS BOW WILL BE SEEN AS IT WAS IN THE BLUE BOW FROM THE LETTERS PLACED ABOVE THE BASE XWHLICH DE NOTE THOSE THAT ARE INTROMITTED SO AS TO COME TO THE EYE THE REST OF THE COLOURMAKING RAYS WHICH CANNOT COME IN THAT DIRECTION BEING MARKED BY LETTERS PLACED UNDER THE BASE THE DCCCIX N INY7O DR HEITCHELS EXPERIMENTS FOR INVESTIGATING WHOLE ANGLE OF THE RED BOW A H IS 15 46I AND THE MEAN OBLIQUITY OF THE EYE AT H IS 49 38 195 IN THE CALCULATION OF BOTH THE BOWS THE SITUATION OF THE EYE AT H HAS BEEN DETERMINED AS IT WOULD BE WERE THE RAYS TO REMAIN IN GLASS BUT AS THEY WILL BE REFRACTED BY THE SIDE OF A PRISM WHEN THEY COME OUT OF IT PROPER COMPUTATIONS MUST BE MADE NOT ONLY OF THE PLACE OF THE EYE IN AIR BUT ALSO OF THE ANGLE WHICH THE BOW WILL SUBTEND FOR THIS WILL BE FOUND TO BE CONSIDERABLY DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT PRISMS THOSE THAT HAVE LARGE REFRACTING ANGLES WILL MAGNIFY THE BOWS MORE AND REQUIRE THE EYE TO BE NEARER THAN OTHERS THAT HAVE SMALLER ANGLES THESE BOWS MAY BE EXAMINED AT LEISURE BY PROJECTING THEM UPON A WHITE GROUND IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER IN A DARK ROOM BY A REFLECTING APPARATUS I ADMITTED A HORIZONTAL BEAM OF THE SOLAR LIGHT THROUGH AN OPENING OF ABOUT AN INCH AND A HALF IN DIAMETER THE FORMATION OF THE BOWS REQUIRING SCATTERED LIGHTO I COVERED THE OPENING WITH A PIECE OF GLASS EVENLY ROUGHNED ON BOTH SIDES THEN WITH AN INTENTION TO OBTAIN A PROJECTION OF THE BLUE BOW I PLACED A PRISM HAVING ONE ANGLE OF 91 AND THE OTHER TWO NEARLY EQUAL CLOSE TO THE EMERIED SURFACE AND TURNED IT UPON ITS AXIS TILL THE ANGLE OF OBLIQUITY OF THE SCATTERED RAYS THAT FELL ON ONE SIDE OF THE PRISM WAS PROPER FOR THE REQUIRED CRITICAL SEPARA TION OF THE COLOURED RAYS THE OBLIQUITY OF THE MIDDLE RAY WITH THE BASE FOR THIS PURPOSE IT HAS BEEN SHOWN MUST BE 49 57 33 IN THIS POSITION THE INTERIOR CRITICAL SEPARATION OF THE PRISMATIC COLOURS TAKING PLACE THE BLUE PART NAMELY THE VIOLET INDIGO BLUE AND ABOUT ONE HALF OF THE GREEN RAYS WERE  STE THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THE 46TH ARTICLE OF THIS PAPERTHAE AUSE OJ COLOZ ED CONCENTIC RINGS REFLECTED AND PASSING THROUGH THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE PRISM PROJECTED THE BLUE BOW UPON THE CIELING OF THE ROOM THE COLOURS MAY THERE BE CONVENIENTLY SEEN BUT AS THIS BOW IS COMPOSED OF THE LEAST LUMINOUS RAYS OF THE PRISMATIC SPECTRUM IT REQUIRES CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION TO PERCEIVE THE FAINTEST OF THEM THE GREEN AND BLUE ARE MOST VISIBLE AND BYRECEIVING THE BOW UPON A SCREEN OF WHITE PAPER HELD AT THE MOST FAVOUR ABLE DISTANCE THE FAINTER COLOURS WHEN THE ILLUMINATION IS VERY BRIGHT MAY ALSO BE PERCEIVED IN ORDER THEN TO PROJECT ALSO THE RED BOW I TURNED THE PRISM UPON ITS AXIS TILL THE SCATTERED LIGHT FELL WITH A PROPER OBLIQUITY ON THE BASE OF IT THE ANGLE REQUIRED FOR THIS PURPOSE IT HAS BEEN SHOWN MUST BE FROM O O O TO 5 56 O55 THE SIDE OF THE PRISM WHICH IS TURNED TOWARDS THE OPENING SHOULD BE COVERED WITH A SLIP OF PASTEBOARD TO PREVENT ANY LIGHT FROM ENTERING IT IN THIS SITUATION I SAW A VERY BRIGHT ARCH CON TAINING RED ORANGE AND YELLOW PROJECTED AT SOME DISTANCE BACKWARDS UPON THE CIELING THAT PART OF THE GREEN WHICH NO DOUBT WAS ALSO TRANSMITTED WAS LOST IN THE BRIGHTNESS WHICH IS TO BE SEEN WITHIN THE BOW FOR THE SAME REASON THAT THE FAINT COLOURS OF THE BLUE BOW CAN ONLY WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY IF AT ALL BE PERCEIVED NAMELY THAT THEY JOIN THE DARK INSIDE OF THE BOW FOR NEWTON HAS PROVED THAT THE SPACE BEYOND THE CONVEX PART OF THE BLUE BOW MUST BE BRIGHT AND THAT BEYOND THE CONCAVE DARK BUT IN THE RED BOW AS MY THEORY WILL SHOW WE HAVE THAT ON THE CONVEX DARK AND ON THE CONCAVE BRIGHT THIS EXPERIMENT THEREFORE PROVES THAT HERE BY THE GRADUAL INTROMISSION OF THE DIFFERENTLY COLOURED RAYS A CRITI CAL SEPARATION TAKES PLACE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE PRISM SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH BY REFLECTION HAPPENS IN THE BLUE BOW AT THE IN N N ET7 DRB IHIESCHZS EXPERIMENTSFOR INVESTIGATIG SIDE AND BY WHICH IN THE PRESENT CASE THE RED PART OF THE PRISMATIC SPECTRUM THAT IS THE RED ORANGE YELLOW AND SOME OF THE GREEN CAN ONLY REACH THE EYE 43 OF A SUDDEN CHAIGE OF THE COLOURS OF THE BOWS IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT THE RED BOW SHOULD BE SEEN NEARLY IN THE SAME PLACE WHERE THE NEWTONIAN BLUE BOW IS VISIBLE FOR IN THE 41ST ARTICLE THE PLACE OF THE EYE FOR SEEING THE BLUE BOW IN THE PRISM OF 1OO DEGREES WAS DETERMINED TO BE AT AN OBLIQUITY OF 49 57 G3 AND WITH THE RED BOW AND IN THE SAME PRISM IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT THE EYE MUST BE PLACED AT THE OBLIQUITY OF 49G 38 19  THE DIFFERENCE IS OILY 8 438 AND BY THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENTS IT WILL BE FOUND THAT BOTH THE BOWS MAY ACTUALLY BE SEEN NEARLY IN THE SAME PART OFEVERY PRISM AND THAT THE DIRECTION OF THE LIGHT BY WHICH WE SEE EITHER THE BLUE OR THE RED BOW DETERMINES WHICH OF THE TWO WILL BE VISIBLE TO PROVE THIS LET A RIGHT ANGLED PRISM BE LAID DOWN ON A SHEET OF WHITE PAPER BEFORE A WINDOW AND WHEN THE EYE IS PLACED IN THE PROPER SITUATION FOR SEEING A RE FLECTED BLUE BOW WE MAY INSTANTLY TRANSFORM IT INTO A TRANS MITTED RED ONE BY COVERING THE SIDE OF THE PRISM WHICH IS TOWARDS THE INCIDENT LIGHT WITH A SLIP OF PASTEBOARD FOR BY STOPPING THE DIRECT LIGHT WHICHL BEFORE FELL ON THE BASE OF THE PRISM AND WAS THERE REFLECTED WE THEN SEE THE BOW BY LIGHT INTROMITTED FROM THE PAPER THROUGH THE BASE WHICH AS HAS BEEN EXPLAINED WILL BE RED WITH PROPER MANAGEM NENT WE MAY HAVE THE BOW HALF RED AND HALF BLUE BLUEIN THE MIDDLE WITH RED SIDES OR RED IN THE MIDDLE WITH BLUE SIDES WHICH APPEARANCES IT WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO EXPLAIN ANY FARTER ESPECIALLY AFTER WHAT HASTHE CAUSE OF COLOURED CONCENTRIC RINGS 273 ALREADY BEEN SAID IN THE I8TH ARTICLE OF THE FIRST PART OF THIS PAPER OF THE CHANGE OF THE COLOURS OF RINGS WHEN WE HAVE BEFORE US A BOW THAT IS HALF BLUE AND HALF RED IT WILL BE SEEN THAT BOTH TAKEN TOGETHER CONTAIN ALL THE PRISMATIC COLOURS IN THEIR REGULAR ORDER OF REFRANGIBILITY IT WILL NOW ALSO APPEAR THAT THE FAINT RED ORANGE AND YELLOW WHICH I HAVE SAID ARE TO BE PERCEIVED ABOVE THE BLUE BOW MAY ARISE EITHER FROM AN IMPERFECTLY TRANSMITTED RED BOW WHICH ALWAYS LIES CONCEALED UNDER THE NEWTONIAN BLUE ONE OR PERHAPS MORE PROBABLY FROM THE PARTIAL REFLECTION OF THE RED ORANGE AND YELLOW RAYS MANY OF WHICH WILL COME TO THE EYE NOTWITHSTANDING THEY ARE ALSO COPIOUSLY TRANSMITTEDT ACCORDING TO MY ACCOUNT OF THE RED BOW IT OUGHT TO BE SEEN IN THE PRISM A LITTLE ABOVE THE BLUE ONE AND THIS IS ALSO FURTHER CONFIRMED BY ANY ONE OF THE EXPERIMENTS IN WHICH WE HAVE SOME PART OF EACH BOW IN VIEW AT THE SAME TIME FOR THEN THE RELATIVE SITUATION OF THE TWO BOWS WILL BE VISIBLE SIMILAR EXPERIMENTS MAY BE MADE BY CANDLE LIGHT UPON EITHER OF THE BOWS FOR WHEN A SHEET OF WHITE PAPER IS PINNED AGAINST A WALL THAT IT MAY REFLECT THE LIGHT OF A CANDLE PLACED UPON A TABLE ABOUT THREE OR FOUR INCHES FROM THE PAPER WE MAY THEN SEE THE BLUE BOW IN A PRISM PLACED UPON A DARK GROUND BEFORE THE REFLECTING PAPER AND THE GREEN COLOUR WHICH IT IS NOT VERY EASY TO PERCEIVE DISTINCTLY IN DAYLIGHT WILL HERE BE VERY VISIBLE AND THE MORE SO IF WE USE AN EQUILATERAL  SEE THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THE 4IST ARTICLE T IN MY MODIFICATIONS OF LIGHT I HAVE PROVED BY UNDENIABLE EXPERIMENTS THAT WITHIN A PRISM AS WELL AS ON THE OUTSIDE OF IT THE RAYS OF ALL THE COLOURS ARE EQUALLY REFEXIBLE ALND THAT A CRITICAL SEPARATION OF THEM ONLY TAKES PLACE AT THOSE ATGLES WHERE BY REFRACTION A RAY CANNOT BE TRANSMITTED74SI DR TIERSCHELS EXPERIENTS FOR INVESTIGATING PRISM INSTEAD OF A RIGHT ANGLED ONE WHEN THE REFLECTING PAPER IS REMOVED FROM THE WALL AND LAID UNDER THE PRISM THAT THE LIGHT MAY TLHEN BE THROWN UPWARDS AND TRANSMITTED THROUGH THE BASE WE SEE A BOW OF A LIVELY RED COLOUR BEFORE I CAN INTRODUCE LNORE INTRICATE PHENOMENA IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO ADVERT TO SOME OTHER PARTICULARS RELATING TO THESE BOWS 44 OF STREAKS AND OTHER PHENOMENA PRODUCED FROM THE PRISMATIC BLUE AND RED BOWS IT HAS BEEN REMARKED IN THE 4OTH ARTICLE THAT THE PRODUCTION OF COLOURS AND THEIR CONFIGURATION WHEN PRODUCED ARE OWING TO DIFFERENT CAUSES THIS WILL NOW BE CONFIRMED BY AN EXPERI MENT SCATTERED RAYS WHEN THEY FALL ON A PRISM WILL BY A CRITICAL SEPARATION OF THE COLOURS PRODUCE BOTH THE BLUE AND THE RED BOWS AND THESE COLOURED APPEARANCES WHEN PRODUCED MAY BE MODIFIED INTO STREAKS CIRCULAR RINGS AND OTHER FORMS BY THE CONFIGURATING POWER OF SURFACES WHEN A PLAIN GLASS OR ME TALLINE MIRROR IS LAID UNDER THE BASE OF A RIGHT ANGLED PRISM IN WHICH WE SEE THE BLUE BOW THE CONTACT OF THE TWO PLAIN SURFACES WILL IMMEDIATELY PRODUCE A GREAT NUMBER OF COLOURED STREAKS THEY WILL BE FOUND TO BE PARALLEL TO THE BOW MOST OF THEM WITHIN AND SOME JUST UNDER IT THEY MAY BE SEEN WITHOUT ANY LENS MERELY BY LOOKING INTO THE PRISM WITH THE EYE PRETTY CLOSE TO THE SURFACE THROUGH WHICH WE SEE THE BLUE BOW THIS EXPE RIMENT PROVES THAT PLAIN SURFACES THOUGH THEY CANNOT PRODUCE COLOURS HAVE A POWER OF MODIFYING AND MULTIPLYING THEM WHEN PRODUCED AS I SHALL LIAVE OCCASION HEREAFTER TO BE MORE PARTICULAR I SHALL NOW ONLY MENTION THAT WHEN WE LAY ATHE CAUSE OF COLOURED CONCENTRIC RINGS SPHERICAL SURFACE SUCH AS AN OBJECT GLASS UNDER THE PRISM IT WILL IMMEDIATELY GIVE US SEVERAL SETS OF INNUMERABLE CONCEN TRIC COLOURED RINGS AND AS WILL NOW BE READILY EXPECTED A CYLINDRICAL SURFACE PLACED UNDER THE PRISM WILL GIVE A NUMBER OF LENTICULAR APPEARANCES SUCH AS ARE CONTAINED BETWEEN THE INTERSECTIONS OF TWO CIRCULAR ARCHES DRAWN CONCAVE TOWARDS EACH OTHER THE IRREGULAR SURFACE OF MICA WILL IN LIKE MANNER PRODUCE MULTIPLICATIONS OF APPEARANCES THAT MAY BE SEEN MUCH BETTER THAN THEY CAN BE DESCRIBED WHEN THE SAME SURFACES ARE APPLIED TO THE RED BOW PHE NOMENA THAT ARE PERFECTLY OF THE SAME FORM WILL BE MADE VISIBLE WITHIN AND JUST UNDER THE BOW AND THE STREAKS WILL ALSO BE IN A PARALLEL DIRECTION THE SIDE OF THE PRISM TO WHICH A PLAIN GLASS MUST BE AP PLIED IS OF SINGULAR USE IN THE EXPLANATION OF MANY APPEAR ANCES OF THE COLOURED PHENOMENA WHICH ARE TO BE SEEN AND IT IS ON THIS ACCOUNT THAT THE FORMATION OF THE GENERATED COLOURS INTO ALL SORTS OF CONFIGURATIONS HAS BEEN NOTICED BEFORE I COME TO THAT PART OF THIS PAPER WHEREIN THIS SUBJECT MUST FIND A FURTHER DISCUSSION FOR BY THE APPLICATION OF A SLIP OF PLAIN GLASS WE CAN DECISIVELY ASCERTAIN THE NATURE OF ANY COLOURED APPEARANCE IN THE PRISM THUS WHEN WE SEE A COMMON COLOURED RED OR BLUE ARCH OCCASIONED BY THE MERE DIFFERENT REFRANGIBILITY OF LIGHT THE PLAIN GLASS ANY HOW APPLIED TO THE PRISM WILL GIVE NO STREAKS IF WE APPLY THE PLAIN GLASS TO A TRANSMITTING SIDE WE CAN HAVE NO STREAKS FROM A CRITICAL BLUE BOW BECAUSE IT IS OCCASIONED BY REFLECTION AND FOR THE SAME REASON WHEN THE PLAIN GLASS IS APPLIED TO A REFLECTING SIDE WE CAN HAVE NO STREAKS THAT BELONG TO A CRITICAL RED BOW BECAUSE IT ORIGINATES AT THE INTROMITTING SURFACE WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF 475276 DR HERSCHELS EXPERIMENTS FOR INVESTIGATING THIS CRITERION I MAY NOW PROCEED TO A REVIEW OF MORE COMPLI CATED PHENOMENA 45 EXPLANATION OF VARIOUS APPEARANCES RELATING TO PRISMATZC BOWS IF IN THE OPEN AIR WE LOOK INTO THE ZENITH WITH A RIGHT ANGLED PRISM HELD ACROSS THE EYES WE SHALL SEE TWO RED BOWS CONVEX TOWARDS EACH OTHER THEY ARE CAUSED BY THE BRIGHT TRANSMISSIONS OF THE LIGHT OF THE HEAVENS THROUGH THE SIDES IN WHICH THE BOWS APPEAR FOR WHEN TO EITHER OF THESE SIDES THE CRITERION OF THE PLAIN GLASS IS APPLIED WE SHALL HAVE COLOURED STREAKS THE COURSE OF THE RAYS WHICH PRODUCE THE TWO BOWS IS DELINEATED IN FIG 3 PLATE XII ABC REPRESENTS THE PRISM AND THE RAYS THAT CAN ENTER THE EYE WHEN THEY FALL ON A B WITHIN THE LIMITS A B A FROM O O O TO 5 5  WHICH ARE THE RED ORANGE YELLOW AND THE BRIGHTEST PART OF THE GREEN WILL FORM THE RED BOW  AND THE SITUATION OF THE EYE AT E WILL BE HAD BY THE MEAN REFRANGIBILITY OF THE RAYS WHICH GIVE THE BOW FOR AS THE ANGLE BC D MUST BE 49 38 195 WE HAVE THE OBLIQUITY B DC  85 SL 405 AND THE ANGLE CEE THAT CONVEYS THE RAY TO THE EYE WILL BE 82 49 3 2 THE SAME THING WILL HAPPEN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PRISM WHERE THE RAYS M N OP Q WILL COME TO THE EYE AT E IN AN EQUAL BUT DIFFERENTLY DIRECTED ANGLE B Q E AND CAUSE AN INVERTED RED BOW TO BE SEEN IN THE SIDE AC WHEN WE LOOK DOWN INTO THE SIDE OF AN EQUILATERAL PRISM WE SEE A BLUE BOW BUT ON LIFTING THE EYE AND PRISM GENTLY UP TOGETHER TOWARDS THE ZENITH THE BOW AT A CERTAIN ALTITUDE WILL BE CHANGED FROM BLUE TO RED AND BY THE APPLICATION OF THE CRITERION IT IS PROVED THAT WE SEE THE

SURFACE OF A PISM IS NOT CONCERNED IN THE FORMATI OF THE BLUE BOW NOR OF THE STREAKS THAT ARE PRODUCED BY A PLAH1 GLASS APPLIED TO THE EICIENT SURFACE IT HAS ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED THAT THE BOWS ARE FORMED BYR SCATTERED LIGHT BUT TO HAVE A DIRECT EXPERIMENTAL PROOF THAT SUCH LIGHT IF NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO THE FORMATION OF THE BOWS IS AT LEAST EQUALLY EFFICIENT WITH REGULARLY REFRACTED LIGHT I TOOK A PRISM WITH ONE SIDE OF IT ROUGHENED ON EMERY AND RECEIVING THE LIGHT THROUGH IT WHEN THE EYE WAS IN THE SITUA TION REQUIRED FOR SEEING THE BLUE BOW I SAW IT AS COMPLETELY IORMED BY SCATTERED LIGHT AS IT COULD HAVE BEEN BY LIGHT REGU LARLY REFRACTED THROUGH A POLISHED SIDE A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF THIS EXPERIMENT SEEMS TOL BE THAT THE FORM OF THE SURFACE THROUGH WHICH LIGHT ENTERS CAN BE OF NO CONSEQUENCE THIS WILL HOWEVER ADMIT OF A MORE CONVINCING PROOF AS FOLLOWS UPON THE MIDDLE OF THE SIDE OF A RIGHT ANGLED PRISM THROUGH WHICH THE RAYS ENTERED THAT CAUSED THE BLUE BOW I LAID A PLANO CONVEX LENS OF AN INCH AND A HALF FOCUS THE RESULT WAS THAT NOT THE LEAST ALTERATION COULD BE PERCEIVED EITHER IN THE FORM OR IN THE COLOUR OF THE BOW BOTH WHICH REMAINED AS PERFECT UNDER THE PLACE WHERE THE INCIDENT RAYS PASSED THROUGH THE LENS AS THEY WERE ON EACH SIDE OF IT WHEN I CHANGED THE CONVEX LENS FOR A PLANOCONCAVE GLASS OF THE SAME FOCUS APPEARANCES WERE STILL THE SAME AND WHEN BY A CRITICAL APPLICATION OF A PLAIN GLASS I PRODUCED COLOURED STREAKS FROM THE BASE OF THE PRISM THE INTERPOSITION OF EITHER THE CONVEX OR CONCAVE GLASS WAS EQUALLY IMMATERIAL A SCATTERING GLASS APPLIED TO THE INCIDENT RAY HAD NO OTHER EFFECT THAN TO DIMINISH THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE BOWTHE CAUSE OF COLOURED CONCENTRIC RINGS THE SAME EXPERIMENT MAY BE REPEATED WITH THE RED BOW BUT AS HERE THE FIRST SURFACE IS ESSENTIAL TO THE FORMATION OF THE BOW THE PLAIN SIDE OF THE CONVEX LENS OR CONCAVE GLASS WHEN PLACED AGAINST THE PRISM AS BEFORE WILL PRODUCE STREAKS NEITHER THE BOW NOR ITS STREAKS HOWEVER WILL BE IN THE LEAST AFFECTED BY THE CONVEXITY OR CONCAVITY OF THE OUTWARD SURFACE OF THE GLASS APPLIED THROUGH WHICH THE LIGHT IS ADMITTED A SCATTERING GLASS WILL HAVE NO EFFECT TO DISTURB THE BOW OR ITS STREAKS AND WHEN THIS GLASS IS EMERIED ON BOTH SIDES WE HAVE AGAIN THE BOW COMPLETE BUT WITHOUT STREAKS AND BY THIS FACT IT IS PROVED THAT UNLESS A POLISHED PLAIN REFLECTING SURFACE IS APPLIED TO THE PRISM STREAKS CANNOT BE FORMED 47 THE STREAKS WHICH MAY BE SEEN IN THE BLUE BOW CONTAIN THE COLOURS OF BOTH THE PARTS OF THE PRISMATIC SPECTRUM BY THE CRI TICAL SEPARATION OF WHICH THE BOW IS FORMED THE MOST FAVOURABLE WAY OF OBSERVING THE COLOURS OF THE BLUN BOW STREAKS THAT ARE FORMED WHEN A PLAIN GLASS IS LAID UNDER THE BASE OF A RIGHT ANGLED PRISM IS TO PLACE A SCREEN OF WHITE PAPER BEFORE AN OPEN WINDOW AND TO LET THE DIRECT SOLAR LIGHT SHINE THROUGH IT UPON THE SIDE OF THE PRISM THIS SCAT TERED LIGHT WILL BE BRIGHT AND UNIFORM AND CAUSE NO ADVENTI TIOUS COLOURS TO MIX

THEIR FORMATION BUT SUCL A SURFACE BE IT GLASS OR METAL CAN ONLY REFLECT RED RAYS WHEN IT RECEIVES THEM AND SINCE WE KNOW THAT THE RED PART OF THE SPECTRUM IS TRANSMITTED AND MUST FALL ON THE

SUCH APPEARANCES MAY BE PRODUCED TO SHOW BY CALCULATION THE COMPLETE FORMATION OF THE STIEAKS IN A CASE THAT IS LIABLE TO SUCH VARIATION ON AC COUNT OF THE DIFFERENT CONTACT BETWEEN THE MODIFYING

BE PARALLEL TO THE SIDES AND BASE OF THE PRISM IF THE EYE COULD RECEIVE THE RAYS WHICH FORM THEM EVERY WHERE IN THE SAME ANGLE FROM A LINE DRAWN PARALLEL TO THAT SIDE OF THE PRISM THROUGH WHICH THEY PASS AN EXPERI MENTAL CONFIRMATION OF THIS WE HAVE BY LAYING DOWN A PRISM AND KEEPING EITHER OF THE BOWS IN VIEW WHILE WE GRADUALLY DRAW THE EYE AWAY IT WILL THEN BE SEEN THAT THE CURVATURE WHICH THE

BE SEEN AT THE MOST OBLIQUE AS WELL AS PERPENDICULAR STATIONS OF THE EYEAS SOON AS THE BLUE BOW IS PERCEIVED THE RINGS BEGIN TO BE FORMED FIRST PARTLY THEN HALF AND LASTLY WE SEE THEM COMPLETED AND WHAT IS REMARKABLE THESE COLOURED RINGS ARE OF SUCH A MAGNITUDE AND BRIGHTNESS THAT THEY CANNOT BE A MOMENT MISTAKEN FOR THOSE WE SEE WHEN A PLAIN GLASS IS LAID UPON THE SAME SPHERICAL CURVETHE EYE BEING THEN GRA DUALLY ELEVATED ABOVE THE RANGE IN WHICH THE BOWS MAY BE SEEN THESE RINGS WILL PRETTY SUDDENLY SHRINK IN THEIR DIMEN SIONS AND LOSE MUCH OF THEIR BRILLIANCY TILL AT LAST WHEN THE EYE COMES TO A PERPENDICULAR SITUATION WE FIND THEM DWINDLED AWAY TO THE SIZE AND APPEARANCE OF SUCH AS MAY BE SEEN WHEN A PLAIN GLASS IS SUBSTITUTED FOR THE PRISM IRREGULAR SURFACES ARE NO LESS DECISIVE IN THE PHENOMENA THEY EXHIBIT FOR WHEN AN EQUILATERAL PRISM IS LAID UPON RED MICA IN A STRONG ILLUMINATION OF SCATTERED LIGHT WE MAY SEE A MOST ADMIRABLE VARIETY OF VERY MINUTE COLOURED APPEARANCES WHEN EVER THE EYE IS BROUGHT TO THE BLUE BOW PLACE BUT AS SOON AS IT IS IN THE LEAST ELEVATED ABOVE OR DEPRESSED BELOW THAT SITUATION THESE FANTASTICAL FIGURES ARE SURE TO VANISH 51 A LENS MAY BE LOOKED UPON AS A PRISM BENT ROUND IN A CIRCULAR FORM THOSE WHO HAVE FOLLOWED ME IN THE ANLALYSIS OF THE BLUE AND RED BOWS WILL READILY ENTER INTO THE APPLICATION I SHALL MAKE OF THIS THEORY TO THE GENERATION OF COLOURED RINGS BY LENSESTHE CAUSE OF COOUED CONCENTRZC RIGS IT HAS BEEN PROVED THAT THE DIFFERENT REFIANGIBILITY OF THE PRISMATIC COLOURS AT CERTLAIN CRITICAL ANGLES WILL CAUSE THE VIOLET INDIGO BLUE AND PART OF THE GREEN RAYS TO BE SEPA RATELY REECTED AND THAT ACCORDING TO WHAT HAS BEEN SAID IN THS 49TH ARTICLE THIS WILL PRODUCE AN EXTENDED STRAIGHTLINED APPEARANCE TINGED WITH THE ABOVEMENTIONED COLOURS IT HAS ALSO BEEN SHOWN THAT THE SAME PRINCIPLE AT CERTAIN CRITICAL ANGLES WILL CAUSE THE RED ORANGE YELLOW AND PART OF THE GREEN RAYS TO BE EXCLUSIVELY INTROMITTED IN SUCHDIRECTIONS AS WILL PRODUCE A SIMILARLY EXTENDED STRAIGHTLINED APPEAR ANCE TINGED WITH THESE LATTER COLOURS FROM THE ANGLE IN WHICH THE EYE MUST RECEIVE THESE APPEARANCES IN A PRISM THEY ARE CONVERTED INTO THE BLUE AND RED BOWS BUT SINCE THEY WOULD APPEAR TO BE STRAIGHT LINES IF THEY WERE SEEN IN DIREC TIONS PERPENDICULAR TO A LINE DRAWN PARALLEL TO THE EDGES OF THE PRISM IT FOLLOWS THAT WERE A LONG PRISM BENT ROUND INTO A CIRCULAR FORM SO THAT ITS TWO ENDS MIGHT MEET THESE LINES WOULD THEN BE CHANGED INTO RINGS ONE OF WHICH WOULD BE FORMED BY REFLECTION THE OTHER BY TRANSMISSION A LENS MAY BE SAID TO BE SUCH A PRISM FROM WHICH INDEED IT DIFFERS ONLY IN ONE RESPECT WHICH IS THAT AN ANGLE CONTAINED BETWEEN TWO LINES APPLIED AS TANGENTS TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF ITS SURFACE IS CHANGEABLE WHEREAS THE REFRACTING ANGLE OF A GIVEN PRISN IS CONSTANT IF IT SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT IN CONSEQUENCE OF CONSIDERING A LENS IN THIS LIGHT A PLANOCONVEX ONE FOR INSTANCE OUGHT TO PRESENT US IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS WITH A RILG OF THE COLOURS OF THE BLUE BOW AND IN OTHERS WITH A SIMILAR RING CONTAINING THOSE OF THE RED ONE I MUST OBSERVE THAT THE REASO WHY SUCH RINGS OR BOWS CAN NEVER BE SEEN BY THE EYE THOUGH THE PHY QQ2 295296 DR HERSCHELS EXPERINENTS FOR INVESTIGATCTG SICAL SEPARATION OF THE RAYS SHOULD ACTUALLY TAKE PLACE IS OWING TO THAT PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCE IN WHICH WE HAVE REMARKED THE LENS DIFFERS FROM A PRISM NAMELY THE CURVATURE OF THE REFRACTING SURFACE FOR ALTHOUGH IT HAS BEEN PROVED THAT THE FIGURE OF THE FIRST SURFACE OF A PRISM IS NOT CONCERNED IN THE FORMATION OF THE BLUE BOW YET THAT OF THE SURFACE THROUGH WHICH IT IS SEEN BY THE EYE IS OF MATERIAL CONSEQUENCE AS WILL APPEAR BY THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENT AN EQUILATERAL PRISM ONE SIDE OF WHICH I HAD MADE CYLIN DRICAL WAS EXPOSED SO AS TO RECEIVE THE INCIDENT LIGHT THROUGH THE CONVEX SURFACE IN THIS SITUATION THE EYE BEING ABOUT THREE OR FOUR INCHES FROM THE PRISM A BOW WAS FORMED WHICH IN EVERY RESPECT WAS LIKE ONE I SAW IN ANOTHER EQUILATERAL PRISM WHOSE THREE SIDES WERE FLAT BUT WHEN THE CONVEXITY OF THE FIRST PRISM WAS TURNED TOWARDS THE EYE THE BOW COULD NO LONGER BE SEEN ALTHOUGH THE CRITICAL SEPARATION OF THE RAYS WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY FORM IT IN THIS AS WELL AS IN THE OTHER PRISM THE TWO SIDES AND ANGLES OF EACH EXPOSED TO THE LIGHT BEING PERFECTLY EQUAL BY MUCH ATTENTION TO WHAT MAY BE PERCEIVED WHEN THE EYE IS PLACED AT VARIOUS DISTANCS I FOUND THAT THE CURVATURE OF THE SURFACE THROUGH WHICH P TRIED TO SEE THE BOW PRODUCED A FOCAL CONTRACTION AND STBSEQUENT INVER SION OF THE RAYS IN THEIR PASSAGE TO THE EYE AND THUS OCCA SIONED A TOTAL CHANGE OF APPEARANCES NOW SINCE A RING OR BOW WOULD NOT BE VISIBLE IN A PRISM BENT ROUND IF THE SIDE THROUGH WHICH IT MUST BE SEEN WERE CURVED WE CANNOT EXPECT TO SEE SUCH APPEARANCES IN A LENS WHICH EVERY WHERE PRESENTS US WITH A SPHERICAL SURFACE THE EFFECT UPON THE APPEARANCE OF THE BOWS PRODUCCD BY THE SURFACE THROUGLH WHIC THE RAYS MUST PASS TO CONE TO THETHE CAUSE OF COLOURED CONCENTRIC RINGS EYE MAY BE STILL BETTER EXAMINED BY LAYING THE PLAIN SIDE OF A PLANOCONVEX GLASS OF A SHORT FOCUS UPON THE FLAT SIDE OF A PRISM THROUGH WHICH WE SEE EITHER OF THE BOWS FOR WHEN THE EYE IS NEAR THE FOCUS OF THE LENS THEY WILL BE ENTIRELY EF FACED AS FAR AS THEY ARE COVERED BY THE LENS A CONSEQUENCE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE MAY BE DRAWN FROM THESE EXPERIMENTS FOR SINCE THE CAUSE OF THE COLOURED AP PEARANCES WHICH HAVE BEEN CALLED BOWS WHEN SEEN IN A PRISM IS NOW PERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD TO BE THE CRITICAL SEPARATION OF THE COLOURS OF THE INCIDENT LIGHT IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT SUCH A SEPARATION WILL CERTAINLY TAKE PLACE WHENEVER A BEAM OF LIGHT CAN FIND AN ENTRANCE INTO GLASS SO AS TO MAKE THE REQUIRED ANGLES EITHER WITH AN INTERIOR OR EXTERIOR SURFACE BE IT IN THE SHAPE OF A PRISM LENS OR SOLID OF ANY KIND ALTHOUGH THE FIGURE OF THE LAST TRANSMITTING SURFACE SHOULD NOT PERMIT SUCH COLOUREDAPPEARANCEMAKINGRAYS TO REACH THE EYE A PLANO CONVEX LENS WILL CONSEQUENTLY BY ITS CONSTRUCTION SEPARATE THE RAYS OF LIGHT WHICH ENTER AT THE CONVEX SURFACE IN SUCH A NANNER AS BY REFLECTION TO PRODUCE WHAT IF IT COULD BE SEEN WOULD BE CALLED A BLUE BOW AND BY RAYS THAT COME IN AT THE PLAIN SIDE SEPARATE THEM BY INTROMISSION SO AS TO PRODUCE A RED ONE TO REMOVE ALL DOUBT ABOUT THE TRUTH OF THIS THEORY I GROUND A SMALL PART OF A PLANOCONVEX LENS FLAT THAT I MIGHT LOOK INTO IT AS IT WERE THROUGH A WINDOW TO SEE WHAT PASSED WITHIN THE FLAT MADE AN ANGLE WITH THE BASE OF ABOUT THIRTYFOUR DE GREES AND I SAW THROUGH IT VERY PLAINLY IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS OF THE ILLUMRINATION A BLUE BOW BY LIGHT ENTERING AT THE CONVEX SURFACE AND A RED BOW BY LIGHT COMING IN AT THE PLAIN ONE WITH REGARD TO A PLAIN GLASS CONTAINED BETWEEN PARALLEL 297298 DR HERSCHELS EXERLIAENTSFOR  IVESTGATI G SURFACES IT MAY BE REMEMBERED THAT WHEN IN THE LAST PARA GRAPH OF THE GC9TH ARTICLE I SAIC THAT STREAKS COULD NOT BE SEEN BYLAYING ANOTHER PLAIN GLASS UNDER IT I INTIMATED AT THE SAME TIIMNE THE FORMATION OF COLOURS  THIS WILL NOW ADMIT OF A SATIS FACTORY EXPLANATION SCATTERED RAYS WILL ENTER INTO A PARALLEL PIECE OF GLASS AND BY REFLECTION THE CRITICAL SEPARATION OF COLOURS WILL TAKE PLACE ON ITS INTERIOR SURFACE SO THAT IF THIS EFICT COULD BE SEEN A BLUE BOW WTOUD APPEAR AND IN THE SAME MANNER A RED BOW MIGHT BE SEEN BY RAYS INTROMITTED THROUGH THE LOWEST SURFACE IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE COURSE OF THESE RAYS STREAKS WOULD ALSO APEAR FROM EACH OF THE BOWS WHEN ANOTHER PLAIN GLASS IS LAID UNDER THE PARALLEL PIECE BUT FROM A CALCULATION MADE ACCORDING TO THE PRINCIPLES THAT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN THE PRECEDING PART OFTLIS PAPER THE REFLECTION OF A MEAN RAY OF THE BLUE BOW FROM THE IRLTERIOR SUIRFACE BEING AT THE ANGLE

BLE BOWS AND THEIR STREAKS WHEN THE UPPER SURFACE OF THE GLASS AS INCLINED ONLY NINE DEGREES TO THE LWER ONE AND POSSIBLY A ICH SMALLER ANGLE WOULD HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO PERNIT THE EMERGENCE OF THE COLOURED RAYS THE STRONG RE FLECTION FORM THE OUTSIDE OF THE GLASS AND THE CONTRACTION OF THE DIMENSIONS OF THE BOWS ARE HOWEVER MUCH AGAINST PER CEIVING THEM AT A GREAT OBLIQUITYTHE CAUSE OF COLOURED CONCENTRIC RZNGS 5 THE CRITICAL SEPARAT ON OF THE OLOURS WHICH TAKES LACE AT CERTAIN 4NGLES OF INCIDENCE IS THE PMAY CAUSE OF THE NEW TONIAN COLOURED RINGS BETWEEN OBJECTGLASSES IT HAS BEEN PROVED THAT STREAKS CONCENTRIC RINGS LENTICULAR IGURES AND ALL SORTS OF IRREGULAR COLOURED PHENOMENA MAY BE SEEN BY MEANS OF THE PRISM AND IN THE 35TH 36TH AND 7TH ARTICLES IT HAS ALREADY BEEN SUFFCIENTLY EXPLAINED THAT THE CAUSE OF THE GREAT VARIETY OF THESE APPEARANCES IS TO BE FOUN IN THE CONFGUR ANG POWER OF SURFACES I HAVE ALSO REMARKED IN THE 4OTH ARTICLE THAT IN ORDER COMPLETELY TO ACCOUNT FOR THE NEWTONNIAN RINGS IT REMAINED ONLY T BE SHOWN HOW THE COLOURS THUS MODIFIED ARE PRODUCED THE PISAC EXPERMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS PAPER HAVE EX PLAINED IN WHAT MANNER A CRITICAL SEPARATION OF THE COLOURS IWHICH TAKES PLACE AT CERTAIN ANGLES OF INCIDENC IS THE CAUSE OF THE APPEARANCE OF THE BLUE AND RED BOWS SINCE THE DIFFE REINT REFLEXIBILTY OF THE RAYS OF LIGHT BY WHICH NEWTON HAS ACCOUNTED FOR TLHE BLUE BOW BRINGS ON A CRITICAL SEPARATION OF THE BLUE COLOURS AND SINCE ALSO THE DIFFRENT INTROMISSIBILITY BY WHICH I HAVE EXPLAINED THE RED BOW OCCASIONS AN EQUALLY CRITICAL SEPARATION OF THE RED ONES IN THE 5OTH ARTICLE I HAVE NOT ONLY PROVED THAT ALL THE ABOVE DESCRIBED VARIOUS APPEARANCES WHICH IN THE FIRST PART OF THIS PAPER WERE PRODUCED BY CONVEX GLASSES MAY BE EQUALLY WELL OBTAINED

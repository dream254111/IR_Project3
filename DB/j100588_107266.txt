Nature,i206964,XVII Continuation of Experiments for investiating the CausF of coloured concentric Rings and other Appearances of a similar Nature By William Herschel LL D F R S Read March 23 i809 IN the first part of this paper I have pointed out a variety of methods that will give us coloured concentric rings between two glasses of a proper figure applied to each other and it has been proved that only two surfaces namely those that are in contact with each other are essential to their formation it will now be necessary to enlarge the field of prismatic phe nomena by showing that their appearance in the shape of rings has been owing to our having only used spherical curves to produce them 35 Cylindrical Curves produce Streaks AM soon as it occurred to me that the cause of the figure of a ly certain prismatic appearance must be looked for in the nature of the curvature of one or both of the surfaces that are essential to its production I was prepared to expect that if a spherical curve when applied to a plain surface of glass produces coloured rings a cylindrical one applied to the same would give coloured lines or streaks To put this to the proof of an experiment I ground one side of a plate of glass into a cylindrical curve and after having given it a polish I laid a slip of plain glass upon it and soon perceived a beautiful set ofDr Herschels Experiments for investigating coloured streaks The broadest of them was at the line of contact and on each side they were gradually narrower and less bright The colours in the streaks were similar to those in the rings and they were in the same manner changeable by pressure as in them Their order was likewise the same if we reckon from the line of contact as with rings we do from the center so that these streaks differed in no respect from rings except in their linear instead of circular arrange ment When the cylindrical surface was laid upon a plain slip of glass the same streaks were seen as in the former experi ment They were of a lively red and green colour and I saw at least ten eleven or twelve on each side of the line of contact Metalline surfaces had the same effect for when the cylin drical surface of glass was laid on a plain metalline mirror I had red orange yellow green and blue streaks In the same manner a plain slip of glass placed upon a polished part of a brass cylinder of ainch in diameter produced also coloured streaks The combination of two cylindrical surfaces has an effect on the streaks which is similar to that which the contact of two spherical ones has on the rings for when I placed the cylindrical surface of glass longitudinally upon the polished part of the brass cylinder the streaks were contracted as rings would have been by the application of two spherical cur s to each other s6othe Cause of coloured concentric I ings 36 Cylindrical and spherical Surfaces combined produce coloured elliptical Rings The theory which suggests to us that the particular figure of every prismatic appearance between glasses depends on the curvature of the surfaces which are in contact is still farther confirmed when spherical and cylindrical curves are applied to each other for these accordingly should give el liptical rings and when I tried the experiment by laying a e6inch double convex lens upon the cylindrical surface of my plate of glass it produced a coloured elliptical central part en compassed with gradually vanishing rings of the same figure By changing the focal length of the lens I could alter the pro portion of the conjugate to the transverse axes of these ellip tical rings at pleasure A lens of 55 inches gave ellipses that were much flattened and one of 5 inches gave them nearly circular 37 Irregular Curves produce irregular Figures The modifying power of surfaces may be further estab lished by such as have no regular figure for these ought to give irregular prismatic phenomena and this was fully proved by the following experiment I took a large piece of mica which had a very glossy but irregular surface and when a 34inch double convex lens was placed upon a small ridge of it several pretty straight streaks might be seen but wherever the ridge was waving the streaks were following the same direction In some places the mica gave irregular coloured arcs that were concave to some dis tant centre and in others the various contorted figures that MDCCCIX M m 26ts6 Dr Herschels Experiments or investigating were to be seen exceeded all the imaginary forms which the most inventive fancy can paint The flexibility of mica also gave room for using different degrees of pressure by which means a continual change of figure and succession of prismatic colours was produced When I laid a piece of this mica upon a cylinder and placed a plain slip of glass or double convex lens upon it all its ir regularities were modified into disfigured streaks with the former and distorted ellipses with the latter Experiments of a similar nature were made upon the irre gular surface of Island crystal and other substances which all gave the same result 38 Curved Surfaces are required for producing the coloured Ap pearances at present under Consideration It has already been seen in the first part of this paper that spheiical curves give circular rings and I have now shown that cylindrical forms produce streaks that a combination of spherical and cylindrical curvatures give elliptical rings and that all sorts of variegated coloured phenomena are made visible by surfaces which are irregularly and variously curved these experiments prove in the fullest manner that the curva ture of surfaces is the cause of the appearance as well as of the slape of the coloured phenomena which are produced For if we can invariably predict from the nature of the curves we employ in an experiment what will be the appearance and form of the colours that will be seen it certainly must prove the efficacy of these curvatures in the production of such phe nomena This will receive additional confirmation in the fol lowing article which shows thatthe Cause of coloured concentric Rzigs 39 Coloured Appearances cannot be produced between the plain Surfaces of two parallel Pieces of Glass applied to one another As the production and modification of the figure of the coloured appearances that have hitherto been considered has in the last article been ascribed to curved surfaces it will be necessary to examine whether such phenomena may not also be seen between the plain surfaces of two parallel peces of glass applied to each other directly in contact or inclined to wards each other in some certain extremely small angle The later of these cases has already been considered in tie ist article of the first part of this paper where I have shown that two plain surfaces let the angle of the wedge of air between them be aa small as you please will not give coloured streaks I have indeed seen two thin plain piecs of glass with a slip of platina of an extraordinary thinness be tveen them at one end tied together which showed some streaks near the place where the glasses were in contact but when I removed the thread that bound them together the streaks vanished which proves that the glasses had been con strained and thus had probably assumed some curvature at the point of contact I have also tried two flat surfaces of glass which were so perfect that no colour could be perceived unless they were by unequal pressure somewhat disfigured and when that was the case arge flashy coloured appearances became visible and their configuration followed very evidently the stress which I laid upon the different parts of the glasses It is however unnecessary to dwell on proofs that streaks cannot be seen when two plain parallel pieces of glass are M m s264 Dr HERSCHELS Experiments for izvestigating applied to each other as it will hereafter be shown that wLen the incumbent plain glass is not of a parallel thickness co loured phenomena may be rendered visible between two per fectly plain surfaces although no force or strain should be used to produce a fallacious curved contact 40 Of the Production of coloured Appearances Hitherto I have only considered the coloured rings which Sir ISAAC NEWTON has pointed out and have shown at the end of the 28th article that no more than two surfaces are essential to their formation It has now also been proved that the configuration of the coloured phenomena arises from the curvature of one or both of the two essential surfaces From these principles it will be seen that we are to distinguish be tween the production of the colours and that of their configu ration wvhen produced By the experiments that have been given the cause of the configuration is laid open to our view but the production and arrangement of the colours remain to be investigated The leading feature of the arrangement of the colours of the rings is prismatic that is to say their order is red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet in order therefore to enter minutely into the subject I shall have recourse to some prismatic experiments It will be necessary here to mention that the proposed enu meration of the modifications of light which was intended to have been given in this part of my paper is grown to such an extent by the number of experiments I have made upon the subject that its introduction would occasion a long inter ruption of the present subject and although undoubtedly thethe Cause of coloured concentric Rings action of bodies and surfaces on light would be better under stood if all the modifications wherein colours are produced had been before us yet as the experiments I have to relate may be made plain either by referring to modifications that are sufficiently known or by explaining what is not already familiar I shall postpone the intended enumeration to some future opportunity and confine myself at present to a few re marks relating to them The colours contained in white light may be separated by reflection as well as by refraction and what is perfectly to my present purpose the order in which the colours thus pro duced are arranged is the same in both cases each of these principles therefore may cause coloured appearances which the particular figure of the surfaces we use will mould into different configurations Sir ISAAC NEWTON for instance has shown that the rays of light will be separated by what he calls a different reflexibi lity when they fall on the base of a prism the violet being reflected first and the red last By this property of the dif ferently coloured rays he has explained a very remarkable phenomenon vvhich is that in a prism when exposed in the open air and when the eye is properly placed  the spectator will see a bow of a blue colourt From the little the author has said of this bow it may be supposed that he did not exa mine it farther than was required for his purpose it will therefore be necessary to enter more fully into the subject t See the illustration of the gth experiment in the first book of NEWTONS Optics page 46 t See the i6th experiment in the second part of the first book page 145 s6566 Dr HERSCHE4LS Experiments for nve stig tng 41 Paiticulars relating to the Newtonian prismatic blue Bow The Newtonian blue bow may very conveniently be exa mined when a right angled prism is laid down on a table before an open window The eye being then brought to a convenient altitude and pretty near the side of the prism we see in it a bow which from the predominant colour may be called blue It contains some green followed by blue indigo and violet A very faint red orange and yellow may also be perceived above the greenish colour but these belong not to the blue bow and have not been noticed by the author Their appearance will hereafter be accounted for To analyse this blue bow more particularly let us admit that the colours which give it the general appearance of what may be called blue consists of half the green and of all the blue indigo and violet rays which are reflected while the other half of the green the yellow orange and red are trans mitten d Then the angle of obliquity at which this separation of the colours will happen in consequence of the different refrangibility of the differently coloured rays assigned by NEWTON will be 49 46 1X5 Let A B C D E Plate XII Fig 1 be rays of light mov in within glass in such directions as to fall on the interior base F G upon the points a p3  S Then if it be required that these rays after reflection from the base should meet in the point H and form the blue bow the angles AaG B3G CyG D S G and E a G must be respectively equal to 49 46 125 490 49 20 4 9 55 336 49 59 414 and 50 7 54 which will give the angles o H  H y H 3  H s equal to 3 75 6 t136 4 78 and 8 166 making in the wholethe Cause of coloured concentric Rings the angle subtended by the bow H E 21 41t5 For in con sequence of the different reflexibility of the differently co loured rays tile violet indigo blue and faintest half of the green rays will be reflected between M and A if they fall on that space in any angle between the above mentioned ones contained between A caG and B A G and will therefore meet at HI and form the greenish blue part of the bow The red orange yellow and the brightest half of the green rays on the contrary being less reflexible will be transmitted through the base between a and 3 and by refraction pass in proper angles into the air The letters vib2g which in the figure are placed within the space a H 3 denote the reflected colours and gy o r put under the base between a and A are the initials of the transmitted colours and in the same manner the re flections and transmissions which must happen between Gy y  and E are expressed by the letters over the base for the former and under it for the latter The order of the colours of the blue bow when it is seen at H is perfectly explained by the letters in the reflected part and the eye must be placed for seeing it at the mean obliquity between the angles A a G and E GC which is 49 57 3 In order to conform this account of the blue bow to the manner in which it was viewed by NEWTON I have preserved his way of ascribing the separation of the rays to ethir difE rent reflelxibiiity which however is merely the effect of their  There is a mistake in one of the anlgles given by NeWTON when in his Optics page 45 he explains the blue bow for 49 deg  taken fron so deg g miakes the breadth of the bow I 4 314 which coatradicts the refractions he has gven page IzI As he only takes in the blue indigo and violet colours instead of 492 de grees it shoiuld rather be 49 267268 Dr HERSCHELS Experiments for investigatinzg different refrangibility The angles at which the rays that constitute the blue bow are separated from the rest may very properly be called critical and the effect which is the conse quence of the oblique incidences that have been given may with equal propriety be called a critical separation of the difie rently coloured rays of light 42 Account of a prismatic red Bow I must now introduce a prismatic appearance which on ac count of its similarity with the Newtonian blue bow from which it only differs in colour I have called a prismatic red bow It consists of red orange yellow and some green rays and the red colour being upon the whole very predominant it may not improperly be called a red bow It is not produced by the Newtonian different reflexibility of the differently co loured rays of light but owes its origin to a modification which takes effect at the outside of the prism at very oblique angles of incidence and may be called a different intromissibility but this like the Newtonian different reflexibility is only the consequence of the different refrangibility of light To see the red bow an observer should place himself in ne open air and standing with his back within a few feet of some wall or building hold the side of an equilateral prism flat over his eyes and look upwards to an altitude of about o0 at the heavens he will then see a beautiful arch of a deep red colour succeeded by a bright orange and yellow with a considerable portion of green on the inside The comparative darkness of the building behind will show the light in front to the best advantage It is also to be observed that alliEe Cause of coloztred concentric Rings a9 experiments on prismatic bows succeed best when the heavens are totally overcast with an uniform cloudiness To analyze the production of this bow let A B C DE Fig 2 Plate XII be rays of liglit moving in air in such directions as to fali on the exterior base FG of a piece of glass upon the points  cyts the n if it be required that these rays after their in tromnission into the glass should meet in the point H and form the red bow the argles A a H B p H Cy H D H d and Ee H must be respectively equal to 130g 9

tromitted any where betweein and p wvith any efect on the red bow since it is only at 13 where the angle H G F is 49 g e18 that they can enter the glass so as to co me to the eye at H The yellow rays will for the same reason be efficiently intromritted only at y where they will make the angle H y F 49 38 23 and the brightest half of the green rays will find an efficient entrance fronm S to e since the smallest angle of their intromission H F is 49 43 43 and the angle HE F which ternmiates the red bow is 49 46 i 5 The arrange ment of the colours of this bow will be seen as it was in the blue bow

placed under the base The DCCCIX N Iny7o Dr HEitCHELs Experiments for investigating whole angle of the red bow a H is 15 46i and the mean obliquity of the eye at H is 49 38 195 In the calculation of both the bows the situation of the eye at H has been determined as it would be were the rays to remain in glass but as they will be refracted by the side of a prism when they come out of it proper computations must be made not only of the place of the eye in air but also of the angle which the bow will subtend for this will be found to be considerably different in different prisms those that have large refracting angles will magnify the bows more and require the eye to be nearer than others that have smaller angles These bows may be examined at leisure by projecting them upon a white ground in the following manner In a dark room by a reflecting apparatus I admitted a horizontal beam of the solar light through an opening of about an inch and a half in diameter The formation of the bows requiring scattered lighto I covered the opening with a piece of glass evenly roughned on both sides Then with an intention to obtain a projection of the blue bow I placed a prism having one angle of 91 and the other two nearly equal close to the emeried surface and turned it upon its axis till the angle of obliquity of the scattered rays that fell on one Side of the prism was proper for the required critical separa tion of the coloured rays The obliquity of the middle ray with the base for this purpose it has been shown must be 49 57 33 In this position the interior critical separation of the prismatic colours taking place the blue part namely the violet indigo blue and about one half of the green rays were  Ste the first paragraph of the 46th article of this paperthae ause oj coloZ ed concentic Rings reflected and passing through the opposite side of the prism projected the blue bow upon the cieling of the room The colours may there be conveniently seen but as this bow is composed of the least luminous rays of the prismatic spectrum it requires considerable attention to perceive the faintest of them The green and blue are most visible and byreceiving the bow upon a screen of white paper held at the most favour able distance the fainter colours when the illumination is very bright may also be perceived In order then to project also the red bow I turned the prism upon its axis till the scattered light fell with a proper obliquity on the base of it the angle required for this purpose it has been shown must be from o o o to 5 56 o55 the side of the prism which is turned towards the opening should be covered with a slip of pasteboard to prevent any light from entering it In this situation I saw a very bright arch con taining red orange and yellow projected at some distance backwards upon the cieling that part of the green which no doubt was also transmitted was lost in the brightness which is to be seen within the bow for the same reason that the faint colours of the blue bow can only with great difficulty if at all be perceived namely that they join the dark inside of the bow For NEWTON has proved that the space beyond the convex part of the blue bow must be bright and that beyond the concave dark but in the red bow as my theory will show we have that on the convex dark and on the concave bright This experiment therefore proves that here by the gradual intromission of the differently coloured rays a criti cal separation takes place on the outside of the prism similar to that which by reflection happens in the blue bow at the in N n et7 DrB IHIESCHzs Experimentsfor investigatig side and by which in the present case the red part of the prismatic spectrum that is the red orange yellow and some of the green can only reach the eye 43 Of a sudden Chaige of the Colours of the Bows It has been shown that the red bow should be seen nearly in the same place where the Newtonian blue bow is visible For in the 41st article the place of the eye for seeing the blue bow in the prism of 1oo degrees was determined to be at an obliquity of 49 57 g3 and with the red bow and in the same prism it has been shown that the eye must be placed at the obliquity of 49g 38 19  The difference is oily 8 438 and by the following experiments it will be found that both the bows may actually be seen nearly in the same part ofevery prism and that the direction of the light by which we see either the blue or the red bow determines which of the two will be visible To prove this let a right angled prism be laid down on a sheet of white paper before a window and when the eye is placed in the proper situation for seeing a re flected blue bow we may instantly transform it into a trans mitted red one by covering the side of the prism which is towards the incident light with a slip of pasteboard for by stopping the direct light whichl before fell on the base of the prism and was there reflected we then see the bow by light intromitted from the paper through the base which as has been explained will be red With proper managem nent we may have the bow half red and half blue bluein the middle with red sides or red in the middle with blue sides which appearances it will not be required to explain any farter especially after what hasthe Cause of coloured concentric Rings 273 already been said in the i8th article of the first part of this paper of the change of the colours of rings When we have before us a bow that is half blue and half red it will be seen that both taken together contain all the prismatic colours in their regular order of refrangibility It will now also appear that the faint red orange and yellow which I have said are to be perceived above the blue bow may arise either from an imperfectly transmitted red bow which always lies concealed under the Newtonian blue one or perhaps more probably from the partial reflection of the red orange and yellow rays many of which will come to the eye notwithstanding they are also copiously transmittedt According to my account of the red bow it ought to be seen in the prism a little above the blue one and this is also further confirmed by any one of the experiments in which we have some part of each bow in view at the same time for then the relative situation of the two bows will be visible Similar experiments may be made by candle light upon either of the bows for when a sheet of white paper is pinned against a wall that it may reflect the light of a candle placed upon a table about three or four inches from the paper we may then see the blue bow in a prism placed upon a dark ground before the reflecting paper and the green colour which it is not very easy to perceive distinctly in daylight will here be very visible and the more so if we use an equilateral  See the first paragraph of the 4Ist article t In my modifications of light I have proved by undeniable experiments that within a prism as well as on the outside of it the rays of all the colours are equally refexible alnd that a critical separation of them only takes place at those atgles where by refraction a ray cannot be transmitted74si Dr tiERSCHELS Experients for investigating prism instead of a right angled one When the reflecting paper is removed from the wall and laid under the prism that the light may tlhen be thrown upwards and transmitted through the base we see a bow of a lively red colour Before I can introduce lnore intricate phenomena it will be necessary to advert to some other particulars relating to these bows 44 Of Streaks and other Phenomena produced from the prismatic blue and red Bows It has been remarked in the 4oth article that the production of colours and their configuration when produced are owing to different causeS this will now be confirmed by an experi ment Scattered rays when they fall on a prism will by a critical separation of the colours produce both the blue and the red bows and these coloured appearances when produced may be modified into streaks circular rings and other forms by the configurating power of surfaces When a plain glass or me talline mirror is laid under the base of a right angled prism in which we see the blue bow the contact of the two plain surfaces will immediately produce a great number of coloured streaks They will be found to be parallel to the bow most of them within and some just under it They may be seen without any lens merely by looking into the prism with the eye pretty close to the surface through which we see the blue bow This expe riment proves that plain surfaces though they cannot produce colours have a power of modifying and multiplying them when produced As I shall liave occasion hereafter to be more particular I shall now only mention that when we lay athe Cause of coloured concentric Rings spherical surface such as an object glass under the prism it will immediately give us several sets of innumerable concen tric coloured rings and as will now be readily expected a cylindrical surface placed under the prism will give a number of lenticular appearances such as are contained between the intersections of two circular arches drawn concave towards each other The irregular surface of mica will in like manner produce multiplications of appearances that may be seen much better than they can be described When the same surfaces are applied to the red bow phe nomena that are perfectly of the same form will be made visible within and just under the bow and the streaks will also be in a parallel direction The side of the prism to which a plain glass must be ap plied is of singular use in the explanation of many appear ances of the coloured phenomena which are to be seen and it is on this account that the formation of the generated colours into all sorts of configurations has been noticed before I come to that part of this paper wherein this subject must find a further discussion for by the application of a slip of plain glass we can decisively ascertain the nature of any coloured appearance in the prism Thus when we see a common coloured red or blue arch occasioned by the mere different refrangibility of light the plain glass any how applied to the prism will give no streaks If we apply the plain glass to a transmitting side we can have no streaks from a critical blue bow because it is occasioned by reflection and for the same reason when the plain glass is applied to a reflecting side we can have no streaks that belong to a critical red bow because it originates at the intromitting surface With the assistance of 475276 Dr HERSCHELS Experiments for investigating this criterion I may now proceed to a review of more compli cated phenomena 45 Explanation of various Appearances relating to prismatzc Bows If in the open air we look into the zenith with a right angled prism held across the eyes we shall see two red bows convex towards each other They are caused by the bright transmissions of the light of the heavens through the sides in which the bows appear for when to either of these sides the criterion of the plain glass is applied we shall have coloured streaks The course of the rays which produce the two bows is delineated in Fig 3 Plate XII ABC represents the prism and the rays that can enter the eye when they fall on A B within the limits a b A from o o O to 5 5  which are the red orange yellow and the brightest part of the green will form the red bow  and the situation of the eye at E will be had by the mean refrangibility of the rays which give the bow for as the angle Bc d must be 49 38 195 we have the obliquity B dc  85 Sl 405 and the angle CeE that conveys the ray to the eye will be 82 49 3 2 The same thing will happen on the other side of the prism where the rays m n op q will come to the eye at E in an equal but differently directed angle B q E and cause an inverted red bow to be seen in the side AC When we look down into the side of an equilateral prism we see a blue bow but on lifting the eye and prism gently up together towards the zenith the bow at a certain altitude will be changed from blue to red and by the application of the criterion it is proved that we see the first by reflectionthe Cause of coloured concentric Rings and the last by transmission For suppose ab Fig 4 Plate XII to be a ray of a mean refrangibility between the violet indigo blue and half the green  when this falls on the side A C of the equilateral prism AB C with an obliquity a b A of 57 58 85 it will be refracted so as to make the angle Cc d 70 2 568 which gives 49 57 3 for the a ngle C dc and consequently the ray de fE will coime to the eye by the same angles of re flection and refraction as it entered the prism and make AfE equal to A b a The eye at E will therefore see a blue bow Then if a plain glass be applied to the transmitting side A C there can be no streaks for blue bows being caused by the critical separation of the rays occasioned by the Newtonian reflexibility the plain glass must be in contact with the re flecting side and as soon as we hold it against B C the coloured streaks will make their appearance The change of the colour of the bow on lifting the prism and eye together towards the zenith is represented in figure 5 for the light from the sky which will enter the prismz on the side A B will eclipse the blue bow which was seen before by light entering from the ground through the side A C in figure 4 then if a b fig 5 is a ray of the mean refrangibility of the red bow it will by refraction give the angle Bcd 49 38 195 from which we obtain B d b equal to 70 21 405 and the ray will by a second refraction come to the eye in an angle C e E of 58 44 124 where the red bow will be seen but in order to produce coloured streaks the plain glass must now be ap plied to the transmitting side A B When a right angled prism is held in the hand so that the light of the sky through an open window may fall upon the base if then an observer with his back to the light looks through MDCCCIX 0 o278 Dr HERSCHIELS Expenirientsjr iZest aing the base intohe t he he ofeprism A B fig 6 he will see an erect blue bow by two reflections only one of which how ever is the cause of the critical separation of the coloured rays the other being a comnmon one For when a mean refrangible bluebowray falls with an obliquity a b C of 82 i 7 3t o B C it will by refraction give the angle B c d 85 t 568 from which we obtain Ade 49  73 which being the mean angle of the critically separated rays they will by re flection pass to the side A C where the angle of the common refection C ef will be 40 2 568  this gives 85 2 56B88 and by refraction the middle of the blue bow will be seen by an eye at E in an angle Eg B equal to the angle a b C From the construction of the figure it is evident that the eye may be drawn from E towards a and always keep the blue bow in view which will still remain erect for hen the eye comes to a the rays by which the bow is seen will then enter at E and the critical reflection will still remain at d as may be satisfactorily proved by an application of the plain glass to AC which will cause no streaks whereas they will immediately appear when it is held under the side A B When the eye looks into the side B C with the same obli quity of 82 17 si but differently directed so that in fig 7 the angle may be a b B instead of a b C a blue bow will again be seen but in an inverted position This also may be drawn over into the other side of the prism without an alteration of its appearance the reason of which is suffciently evident from the construction of the figure but in this case the critical re flecton will be a e and the common one at d It will be proper o shew that like appearances of the red bow may be seen for this purpose let the prism be laid viththe Cause o coloured cnentric Rizngs 79 one side upon a sheet of white paper placed in a window with the base towards the observer as represented in fig 8 In this position the light from without reflected by the paper under the prism will be brighter than that from within the room and the very oblique incident rays a b will be refracted by the horizontal ide A

may be drawn over into the perpendicular side without change of positon for the scattered rays refected fron the paper will also enter the prism in the same oblique angle of incidence fronl the opposite direction a b fig 9 where having caused the red bow by an intromissive critical separation at c they will come to the eye after a common refletion from the side A C in the same angle as before When an inverted red bow is to be seen the eye must be placed a little lower and the calculation of the angles in the loth and ith figures which represent the course of the rays being similar though differently directed will be sufficiently understood by an inspection of them but as in fig 8 and 9 the intromissive separation was produced by the honzontal side so it is in these fgures eiected by the vertical one all vhich may be proved by a proper application of the criterion There are many other phenonena attending the bows but as they are more intricate and not necessary for my present purpose I leave them to the ingenuity of those ho have en tered into the preceding calculations which are quite sufficient them be 00 2SO DiD HERSCHEL S xperiments t r investiating 46 The ist Surface of a Pism is not concerned in the Formati of the blue Bow nor of the Streaks that are produced by a plah1 Glass applied to the eicient Surface It has already been mentioned that the bows are formed byr scattered light but to have a direct experimental proof that such light if not absolutely necessary to the formation of the bows is at least equally efficient with regularly refracted light I took a prism with one side of it roughened on emery and receiving the light through it when the eye was in the situa tion required for seeing the blue bow I saw it as completely iormed by scattered light as it could have been by light regu larly refracted through a polished side A natural consequence of this experiment seems tol be that the form of the surface through which light enters can be of no consequence this will however admit of a more convincing proof as follows upon the middle of the side of a right angled prism through which the rays entered that caused the blue bow I laid a plano convex lens of an inch and a half focus the result was that not the least alteration could be perceived either in the form or in the colour of the bow both which remained as perfect under the place where the incident rays passed through the lens as they were on each side of it When I changed the convex lens for a planoconcave glass of the same focus appearances were still the same and when by a critical application of a plain glass I produced coloured streaks from the base of the prism the interposition of either the convex or concave glass was equally immaterial A scattering glass applied to the incident ray had no other effect than to diminish the brightness of the bowthe Cause of coloured concentric Rings The same experiment may be repeated with the red bow but as here the first surface is essential to the formation of the bow the plain side of the convex lens or concave glass when placed against the prism as before will produce streaks neither the bow nor its streaks however will be in the least affected by the convexity or concavity of the outward surface of the glass applied through which the light is admitted A scattering glass will have no effect to disturb the bow or its streaks and when this glass is emeried on both sides we have again the bow complete but without streaks and by this fact it is proved that unless a polished plain reflecting surface is applied to the prism streaks cannot be formed 47 The Streaks which may be seen in the blue Bow contain the Colours of both the Parts of the prismatic Spectrum by the cri tical separation of which the Bow is formed The most favourable way of observing the colours of the blun bow streaks that are formed when a plain glass is laid under the base of a right angled prism is to place a screen of white paper before an open window and to let the direct solar light shine through it upon the side of the prism This scat tered light will be bright and uniform and cause no adventi tious colours to mix with the streaks The eye should be within six or seven inches of the prism A streak consists of a certain principal colour and the intermediate tint which se parates it from the next and in the following menmorandum of foburteen streaks which I saw in the manner above described the principal colours are placed in front and the dividing tints at the side between themo e818q Dr HERSCHELs

the second surface of the subjac at glass which by other experiments I know to have a multiply 1 1the Cause of coloured concent ic Rings s83 ing power of at least six or seven reiterated interior reflections all of which may be seen through the side of the prism had any share in the production of these streaks I fixed on one side of it a glass of which the lowest surface was emeried and on the other a metalline plain mirror but found that the streaks were both in number and colour perfectly alike in thein all By this account it is evident that the streaks derived from the blue bow contain not only the colours of the blue reflected but also those of the red transmitted part of the spectrum This fact is a clear indication of the office which is performed by the surface of the subjacent plain glass which is simply that of reflecting back the rays of the transmitted red part of the spectrum which being mixed with the blue part both togethr by their intersections produce the observed streaks as will b explaincd hereafter T hat the colours of the transmitted part of the spectrum are reflected back iinto the prism is a point which I suppose will be admitte  but if it shouid be imagined that the red rays in the streaks of the blue bowv wlight come into the prism by a scattered reflection of the light vich falls on the plain glass under its base thenu I say tht a sheet of white paper or double emeried glass ought to give the brightest streaks whereas on the contrary neither of then produces any it is therefore evident that a regular reflecting surface is necessary to their formation but sucl a surface be it glass or metal can only reflect red rays when it receives them and since we know that the red part of the spectrum is transmitted and must fall on the reflecting surface it is but fair to conclude that tie  See the last paragraph of the preceding article84 Dr HERSCHELS Experiments for investigating rays of which that part is composed are those which by re flection reenter the prism 48 On the Formation of Streaks As I have now ascertained that the streaks we see when a plain glass is laid under a prism which shows the blue bow are formed by the principle of reflection which throws back the transmitted rays it will be a considrable satisfaction if we can trace the course of these rays far enough to have some idea of the arrangement whereby such appearances may be produced To show by calculation the complete formation of the stIeaks in a case that is liable to such variation on ac count of the different contact between the modifying surfaces the position of the light and the inclination of the eye would be a most laborious if not endless undertaking  it will there fore be sufficient if I can make it appear that streaks must unavoidably be produced by the rays which after transmission are reflected back again and mix with those that form the bow and this I believe will not be difficult For instance let F G fig 12 Plate XIII be the base of a solid piece of glass in which a compound ray of light is moving from A to a with an obliquity A a G 4 49 6 125 and let I K be the plain sur face of a reflecting substance placed under the base then will the violet indigo blue and the faintest part of the green of this ray be reflected at c and the remaining green the yellow orange and red will be transmitted Now in order to un derstand the intention of this figure it will be necessary to observe that on account of the minuteness of the operations of light all the lines and distances are represented upon a scale one thousand times larger than what the calculation givesthe Cause of coloured concentnrc Rizgs 285 them The real dimensions of several lines therefore cannot find room in the figure and must be supplied by imagination The distance of the eye from the base F G for instance which in the calculation has been assumed to be only three inches will be 300ooo the diameter of the pupil of the eye 200oo the breadth of the base not less than 2160 and the subtense of the whole blue bow will be twentyfour inches eight tenths The distance between the reflecting surface I K and base F G I have supposed to be the ten thousandth part of an inch it is therefore in this figure represented by one tenth of an inch and the space a  in which the colours that have been men tioned are transmitted and which by calculation is oo3588 is expressed by 359 inches The rays of the different colours which are transmitted at a will be refracted in different angles and when they come to the reflecting plane will be returned to the base in such a direction as to come to it again in the same angle in which by refraction they left it but their distance from the point a when they reach the base will differ considerably If we call the angle of refraction qp and the distance of the reflecting rad plane from the base x then 2x x tan will be an expression for the intervals at which the several rays will reenter the base which for red will be ar  0019198 for orange o  oo22974 for yellow ay  9o26675 and for green acg oo0043  At these places the rays will be a second time re fracted and rise towards the eye in parallel directions and with an obliquity of 49 46 125 equal to that of their inci dence A G Their course is represented in the figure by the letters a rr r o o o ay yy and aggg MDCCCIX P p286 Dr HERSCHELS Experimentsfor investigating These things being premised I proceed to explain the con sequences that must arise from the mixture of the transmitted with the originally reflected rays The first is that the rays which after transmission reenter the prism at different points and are the cause of the streaks will not proceed in a parallel direction with those that by reflection from the same or neigh bouring points form the blue bow For instance let A od and B3 A  fig 13 be two incident and reflected rays of the blue bow then if the yellow ray transmitted at a after two refractions and one reflection not expressed in this figure reenters the prism at y it will make the angle yy F equal to the angle A a G But from the construction of the blue bow it has been shown that B  G is greater than A a G  A F is therefore greater than yy F and the rays a d and y y will meet somewhere in the line A  produced If we call the greatest of the two angles m the smallest n and the distance sin n of the angular points d then d x i will give us the sii m n length of the line a A at which the two rays will meet and intersect each other which according to the enlarged size of this figure will be at 773 inches from  For the same rea son the orange ray o o will meet3  at 1084 inches and the red ray r r at 1401 inches from A It follows also from the same construction that some of the transmitted rays will di verge from the reflected ones for instance the green ray transmitted at a which reenters the prism at g will make the angle gg F less than the angle  A F the rays 3 A and g g will therefore diverge To this may be added that gg y y o o r r and c a  will be parallel If such difference between the directions of the transmittedthe Cause of coloured concentric Rings and reflected rays takes place it will be seen that the rays transmitted through different points are among themselves subject to the same variety in the direction of their course rr o o ytyf gg for instance which passed through the point a are parallel to each other but all of them converge respectively to r r o o yy g transmitted through c and on the other hand yy o o r r diverge from gg Fig 14 Plate XIV is a general representation of the course of the rays of the blue bowand of those that produce the streaks The base of the bow is divided into twenty equal parts and one ray of the bow reflected from each of the points of the division is marked by a line Twentyone sets of rays of the different colours transmitted through the same points reenter the base at their calculated places and are represented by dotted lines drawn at proper angles but here it should be noticed that the difference of the twenty angles being much too small to give any idea of their converging or diverging condition the difference between each set has been expressed by one degree less towards the right and one degree more towards the left the angle of the middle ray being of its proper magnitude The strong lines marked A as B  C  D 3 E s show the division of the colours and are the same which in fig i were used to explain the construction of the blue bow The rays incident on the base FG in the direction of these lines which are reflected in the same angles and are also marked with strong lines meet at the point where the eye is supposed to be placed The figure has been drawn by the result of a strict calcula tion contained in the following table In the first column are the angles of the obliquity of the incident rays in the second Pps 287288 Dr HERSCHELS Experiments for investigatzng

11 iZ ti C3 tt  2 Z29o Dr HERSCHELS Experiments for investigating From the complex nature of this figure it will immediately be seen that we cannot attempt an investigation of the parti cular streaks that will be formed by the mixture of the trans mitted with the reflected rays An inspection of it however will be sufficient to show that streaky appearances must be produced For instance between M and the first red ray which reenters the base a narrow blue streak should be seen this will be broken in upon by the mixture of two sets of red orange and yellow rays which together with the reflected colours of the bow the green being still wanting must give a pale red division immediately joining the blue streak When we advance farther into the figure the great mixture of the colours and the different directions of the rays are so various that nothing particular can be determined with out entering into a very complicated calculation of the meeting and intersections of the rays we see however that these mixtures will produce a condensation of rays in some parts and vacancies in others so that no uniform tinge can remain and consequently streaky appearances must be seen The same conclusion may be drawn from an inspection of the places where the transmitted colours reenter the base for the green which is transmitted between  and i3 does not enter again till after the fourth division of the base tle blue which begins to be transmitted at 3 cannot find admittance again till after the tenth the indigo transmitted from y to S does not reenter into the composition till after the sixteenth divi sion and the violet transmitted between  and E will only come in again after the nineteenth There will consequently be a considerable space without green another without blue a third without indigo and a fourth without violet fromthe Cause of coloured concentric Rings which it follows that streaky appearances must every where be seen in the composition of the rays that come to the eye We should also notice that towards S all colours hut violet will be transmitted for which reason when they rise again a com pound of them will produce streaks that approach to white such as pale red pale bluish green dingy yellow and dirty white so that both at the b2ginning and end of the bow streaks all observations X of them agree perfectly with what is pointed out by the foregoing remarks and though we have not analysed the particular construction of the streaks in the middle of the bow yet what has been said will sufficiently prove that various successive changes of the colours must also take place It will be understood that I have only attempted to give some idea of the action of surfaces in giving configuration to colours that are already produced but that the principle of reflection is the cause of streaks will remain evident even if the method of its action should not have been explained so much to our satisfaction as we might wish It will also re main to be proved that streaks are only the effect of one of those modications which depend on the figure of the reflect ing surface t and having got thus far in this research I may advance towards a final consideration of my subject 49 Prismatic Bows when seen at a Distance are straight Lines The next point to be shown in order to approach gradually to a solution of my problem is that the apparently arched figure of the blue and red bows which may be seen in a prism  See the first paragraph of the last article See the second paragraph of the 44th article 201e9S Dr HERSCHELS Experiments for investigating is merely the consequence of the position of the eye and the modifying power of the surface through which it sees them For a proof of this it would be sufficient to refer to the prin ciples of the formation of the bows from which it must be evident that the critical separation of the rays will be exerted in every direction and that the extent of the bows we see would consequently be parallel to the sides and base of the prism if the eye could receive the rays which form them every where in the same angle from a line drawn parallel to that side of the prism through which they pass An experi mental confirmation of this we have by laying down a prism and keeping either of the bows in view while we gradually draw the eye away it will then be seen that the curvature which the bows had assumed will continually be diminished and nearly vanish at a very moderate distance 5o The Colours of the Bowstreaks owe their Production to the Principle of the critical Separation of the diferent Parts of the prismatic Spectrum That streaks will be produced when a plain glass is laid under the side of a prism which forms either of the coloured bows has already been sufficiently shown but that these streaks as well as the rest of the phenomena which have been mentioned in the 44th article are exclusively to be deduced from the same principle by which the bows have been ex plained will require some proof With regard to streaks the following experiment I believe will remove every doubt upon the subject Let a plain glass be laid under the base of a right angled prism then if the eye at first be placed very low no streaksthe Cause of coloured concentric Rngs B93 wll be seen but when afterwards the eye is gradtIiuy ele ated tifl by the appearance of the blue bow we find that the principle of the critical separation of colours is exere the streaks will become visible and not before nor will th y re main in view when the eye islifted higher than the situation in which the effects of the critical separation are visible It is therefore evident not only that the colours are furnished by the same cause which produces the bow but also that they are modified into streaks by the plain surface under the In additon to this it must be remarked that the criterion which has been successfully used in the explanation of several prismatic phenomena proves that no other colours but those which arise from the same source can be modified so as to give streaks The following experiment will show the foun dation on which this criterion is establshed Let there be an horizontal opening in the upper part of a windowshutter of about three feet long and one foot high then if we look at it through one side of a right angled prism we shall see a red bow from the highest margin of the open ing and a blue one from the lowest but when a plain glass is applied to either of the sides of the prism through which we see these bows neither of them will give any coloured streaks The experimenter must carefully keep the critical bows out of the way for should either of them fall upon those which are under examination streaks must of course be seen to pass over them When a spherical surface is placed under the prism it has likewise been shown that coloured rings will be seen but these like the streaks will not be visible when the eye is MDCCCIX qO49 Dr HERSCIJELS Experiments for investtigating below the place where the bows can be seen which would not have happened had a plain glass been used instead of the prism for with such an arrangement coloured rings may be seen at the most oblique as well as perpendicular stations of the eyeAs soon as the blue bow is perceived the rings begin to be formed first partly then half and lastly we see them completed and what is remarkable these coloured rings are of such a magnitude and brightness that they cannot be a moment mistaken for those we see when a plain glass is laid upon the same spherical curveThe eye being then gra dually elevated above the range in which the bows may be seen these rings will pretty suddenly shrink in their dimen sions and lose much of their brilliancy till at last when the eye comes to a perpendicular situation we find them dwindled away to the size and appearance of such as may be seen when a plain glass is substituted for the prism Irregular surfaces are no less decisive in the phenomena they exhibit for when an equilateral prism is laid upon red mica in a strong illumination of scattered light we may see a most admirable variety of very minute coloured appearances when ever the eye is brought to the blue bow place but as soon as it is in the least elevated above or depressed below that situation these fantastical figures are sure to vanish 51 A Lens may be looked upon as a Prism bent round in a circular Form Those who have followed me in the anlalysis of the blue and red bows will readily enter into the application I shall make of this theory to the generation of coloured rings by lensesthe Cause of cooued concentrzc Rigs It has been proved that the different refiangibility of the prismatic colours at certlain critical angles will cause the violet indigo blue and part of the green rays to be sepa rately reected and that according to what has been said in ths 49th article this will produce an extended straightlined appearance tinged with the abovementioned colours It has also been shown that the same principle at certain critical angles will cause the red orange yellow and part of the green rays to be exclusively intromitted in suchdirections as will produce a similarly extended straightlined appear ance tinged with these latter colours From the angle in which the eye must receive these appearances in a prism they are converted into the blue and red bows but since they would appear to be straight lines if they were seen in direc tions perpendicular to a line drawn parallel to the edges of the prism it follows that were a long prism bent round into a circular form so that its two ends might meet these lines would then be changed into rings one of which would be formed by reflection the other by transmission A lens may be said to be such a prism from which indeed it differs only in one respect which is that an angle contained between two lines applied as tangents to different parts of its surface is changeable whereas the refracting angle of a given prisn is constant If it should be remarked that in consequence of considering a lens in this light a planoconvex one for instance ought to present us in certain situations with a rilg of the colours of the blue bow and in others with a similar ring containing those of the red one I must observe that the reaso why such rings or bows can never be seen by the eye though the phy Qq2 295296 Dr HERSCHELS Experinents for investigatCtg sical separation of the rays should actually take place is owing to that particular circumstance in which we have remarked the lens differs from a prism namely the curvature of the refracting surface for although it has been proved that the figure of the first surface of a prism is not concerned in the formation of the blue bow yet that of the surface through which it is seen by the eye is of material consequence as will appear by the following experiment An equilateral prism one side of which I had made cylin drical was exposed so as to receive the incident light through the convex surface In this situation the eye being about three or four inches from the prism a bow was formed which in every respect was like one I saw in another equilateral prism whose three sides were flat but when the convexity of the first prism was turned towards the eye the bow could no longer be seen although the critical separation of the rays would undoubtedly form it in this as well as in the other prism the two sides and angles of each exposed to the light being perfectly equal By much attention to what may be perceived when the eye is placed at various distancs I found that the curvature of the surface through which P tried to see the bow produced a focal contraction and stbsequent inver sion of the rays in their passage to the eye and thus occa sioned a total change of appearances Now since a ring or bow would not be visible in a prism bent round if the side through which it must be seen were curved we cannot expect to see such appearances in a lens which every where presents us with a spherical surface The effect upon the appearance of the bows produccd by the surface througlh whic the rays must pass to cone to thethe Cause of coloured concentric Rings eye may be still better examined by laying the plain side of a planoconvex glass of a short focus upon the flat side of a prism through which we see either of the bows for when the eye is near the focus of the lens they will be entirely ef faced as far as they are covered by the lens A consequence of great importance may be drawn from these experiments for since the cause of the coloured ap pearances which have been called bows when seen in a prism is now perfectly understood to be the critical separation of the colours of the incident light it must be admitted that such a separation will certainly take place whenever a beam of light can find an entrance into glass so as to make the required angles either with an interior or exterior surface be it in the shape of a prism lens or solid of any kind although the figure of the last transmitting surface should not permit such colouredappearancemakingrays to reach the eye A plano convex lens will consequently by its construction separate the rays of light which enter at the convex surface in such a nanner as by reflection to produce what if it could be seen would be called a blue bow and by rays that come in at the plain side separate them by intromission so as to produce a red one To remove all doubt about the truth of this theory I ground a small part of a planoconvex lens flat that I might look into it as it were through a window to see what passed within The flat made an angle with the base of about thirtyfour de grees and I saw through it very plainly in different directions of the illumrination a blue bow by light entering at the convex surface and a red bow by light coming in at the plain one With regard to a plain glass contained between parallel 297298 Dr HERSCHELS ExerliAentsfor  ivestgati g surfaces it may be remembered that when in the last para graph of the gc9th article I saic that streaks could not be seen bylaying another plain glass under it I intimated at the same tiimne the formation of colours  this will now admit of a satis factory explanation Scattered rays will enter into a parallel piece of glass and by reflection the critical separation of colours will take place on its interior surface so that if this efict could be seen a blue bow wtoud appear and in the same manner a red bow might be seen by rays intromitted through the lowest surface In consequence of the course of these rays streaks would also apear from each of the bows when another plain glass is laid under the parallel piece but from a calculation made according to the principles that have been established in the preceding part oftlis paper the reflection of a mean ray of the blue bow from the irlterior suirface being at the angle 49 57 3  and this bei ng also the oblique in cidence on the upper surface a ra y hict cmes in that direc tion with the mean refrangiblit o te ray of the blue bow cannot come out of glass The anr of ob iquity of the mean intromitted ray for the red bow is 40 8 i95 and on con puting ts direction by the n an refran ity of the red bow it will al1soe found that it cannot clear the glass I have seen t ble bows and their streaks when the upper surface of the glass as inclined only nine degrees to the lwer one and possibly a ich smaller angle would have been sufficient to pernit the emergence of the coloured rays The strong re flection form the outside of the glass and the contraction of the dimensions of the bows are however much against per ceiving them at a great obliquitythe Cause of coloured concentric Rzngs 5 The critical Separat on of the olours which takes lace at certain 4ngles of Incidence is the pmay Cause of the New tonian coloured Rings between Objectglasses It has been proved that streaks concentric rings lenticular igures and all sorts of irregular coloured phenomena may be seen by means of the prism and in the 35th 36th and 7th articles it has already been suffciently explained that the cause of the great variety of these appearances is to be foun in the confgur ang power of surfaces I have also remarked in the 4oth article that in order completely to account for the Newtonnian rings it remained only t be shown how the colours thus modIfied are produced The pisac experments contained in this paper have ex plained in what manner a critical separation of the colours Iwhich takes place at certain angles of incidenc is the cause of the appearance of the blue and red bows since the diffe reint reflexibilty of the rays of light by which NEWTON has accounted for tlhe blue bow brings on a critical separation of the blue colours and since also the diffrent intromissibility by which I have explained the red bow occasions an equally critical separation of the red ones In the 5oth article I have not only proved that all the above described various appearances which in the first part of this paper were produced by convex glasses may be equally well obtained by the use of a prism but have also shown that the great simplicity of this valuable optical instrument has cleared up great diiiiculties by pointing out to us tat the colours which are modified into such various shapes are in all prisma tic experiments exclusively produced by the critical separation 9990oo Dr HERSCHEL S Experiments for z es t irr of the rays of light Now as this 1nmst 1 3 I itle  it will certainly not be philosophical to Lok fur a di rent cause of the same or simiilar effects when convex riases vwhich have all the required prismatic propertiis are utsd to produce thern To show the great similarity or rath1r the identity of these effects let us examine them in dif lrnt points of view a d since the variety of the configurations is no longer an object that wants explaining I shall only take the most simple case of each namely the coloured rings that are produced when a planoconvex lens is laid with its convex side upon a plain reflecting surface and the colouiJrd streaks which are pro duced when the base of a right angled prism is in the same manner placed upon such a surface The form of rings arises from the spherical figure of the lens The rightlined appearanice of the streaks is owing to the strazight figure of the plain surface of the prism The colour of the rings may suddenly be changed  The colour of the blue bowstreak may as instantly be converted into those of the red bow 1 Thle cause of the sudden change of the rings has been shown to be that the sets of one colour are seen by reflection and those of other by transmission  By this it will be understood that if any case should occur in which the critical separation cannot account for the observed phenomena we are then authorised to look out for some other cause to explain them t See the

coloured concentric Rings It has also been shown that the blue bowzsreaks are seen by re flection  and those of the red bow by transmission In a lens we may at the same time see in half the set the colours of the reflected and in the other half the colours of the transmitted ringst And i a prism held before an open window when the eye is close to it and when half the bow falls on the side of the room we may see blue streaks by reflection from half the blue bow and green streaks by transmission from half the red bow When deep convex or concave glasses are laid upon the first surface of a lens the rings are not affected by it And when the same glasses are laid upon the first surface of a prism the streaks remain unaltered J1 When the convexity of the lens which is placed on the reflecting surface is changed the size of the rings is also changed  And when the angle of the prism is increased or diminished the distance of the streaks undergoes a proportional alteration When the lens is pressed upon the plain glass the rings increase in diametertt And by a pressure of the plain glass against the prism the dis tance of the streaks grows larger To form rings by a lens scattered light is only required And the same light is best for the production of streaks by a prism Many other instances of similarity might be adduced but See the 43d article t See the second paragraph in the i8th

eriL ents c those that have been recited will surely be sufficient to show that the same operations which will produce these prsmatic phenomena will equally account for those that are formed by the lens now as it has been clearly proved that the critical separation of the colours which takes place at certain angles of incidence occasions all the phenomena of the blue and red bows and of the streaks rings and other regular or irregular appearances that may be seen in a prism there cannot remain a doubt but that the Newtonian rings observed between object glasses are owing to the same cause 535 Remarks relatingo the Newtonia alterate Fts of easy Reqection and easy fransmission In attempting to rescue the scienceof optics from what has been so long considered as unsatisfactoryfor explaining the great question about the cause of the coloured rings I have made use of a principle the e cts of which have so near a resemblance to those of the suppositious fits of easy reflection and easy transmission that the author of them might easily be misled by appearances But although the principle of a critical separation of the colours substituted for these fits ad mits the reflection of some rays at the same angles of inci dence at which others are transmitted yet since the New tonian different refrangibility of light will account for these critical reflections within glass and the equally critical intro missions from without we can have no longer any reason t ascribe original fits to the rays of light which in the first part of this paper they have already been proved not to possess and which now in all prismatic experiments I have shown are not necssary for explaining appearances that may be accounted for without them Slough near Windsor Dec 9 18o8aL 3 g 4 o o   i  Z

J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,108410,THE FIGURE AND PRIMITIVE FORMATION OF THE EARTH OR RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS PART I,I207006, 495  XXI THE FIGURE AND PRIMITIVE FORMATION OF THE EARTH OR RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICSPART I BY HENRY HENNESSY MRIA C COMMUNICATED BY MAJOR LUDLOW BEAMISH FRS RECEIVED OCTOBER 29READ DECEMBER 17 1846 I THE HYPOTHESIS BY WHICH THE FIGURES OF THE IHEAVENLY BODIES ARE THEORETICALLY EXPLAINED HAS LONG ENGAGED THE ATTENTION OF GEOLOGISTS AND GEOMETERS WITHOUT HAVING ACQUIRED ANY IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENTS GREAT AS HAVE BEEN THE DISCOVERIES WHICH HAVE ORIGINATED FROM THIS HYPOTHESIS IT REMAINS IN NEARLY THE SAME PHILOSOPHICAL POSITION AS THAT TO WHICH IT HAD ARRIVED WHEN CLAIRAUT PUBLISHED HIS THEORY OF THE FIGURE OF THE EARTH DURINGITHE PERIOD OF MORE THAN A CENTURY WHICH HAS ELAPSED SINCE THE APPEARANCE OF THAT IMMORTAL WORK THE IMPROVEMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE THEORY OF THE FIGURES OF THE PLANETS APPEAR TO CONSIST CHIEFLY IN DISCOVERIES CONNECTED WITH THE ATTRACTIONS OF BODIES AND IN SOME IMPORTANT GENERALIZATIONS OF THE EQUILI BRIUMT AND MOTIONS OF FLUIDS COMPARATIVELY FEW POSITIVE DISCOVERIES HAVE HOWEVER BEEN AS YET MADE IN GEOLOGY AS DEDUCTIONS FROM THE HYPOTHESIS OF THE PRIMITIVE FLUIDITY OF THE EARTH IN EXPLANA TION OF THIS CIRCUMSTANCE SEVERAL CAUSES MAY BE ASSIGNED ONE OF WHICH APPEARS TO BE THE LIMITED NATURE OF THE HYPOTHESIS IT HAS NOT BEEN CONSIDERED SUFFICIENT TO SUPPOSE THAT THE EARTH WAS ORIGINALLY A MASS OF HETEROGENEOUS MATTER IN A FLUID STATE AN ADDITIONAL SUPPOSITION HAS BEEN MADE IN SUPPORT OF WHICH I AM NOT AWARE THAT ANY EVIDENCE HAS BEEN EVER ADDUCED THE SUPPOSITION ALLUDED TO IS THAT THE VOLUME OF THE ENTIRE MASS AND THE LAW OF DENSITY OF THE FLUID HAVE NOT BEEN CHANGED BY THE SOLI DIFICATION OF A PART OF THAT FLUID NO MATTER HOW FAR THE SOLIDIFICATION MAY HAVE PRO CEEDED OR IN OTHER WORDS THAT THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE MOLECULES COMPOSING THE EARTH IS THE SAME IN THE PRESENT STATE OF OUR PLANET AS THAT WHICH THEY HAD WHEN THE MASS WAS FLUID ALTHOUGH NO PRECISE EVIDENCE CAN BE BROUGHT FORWARD FOR THE EXAMI NATION OF THIS PORTION OF THE HYPOTHESIS IT APPEARS NOT TO BE ENTIRELY CONSISTENT WITH WHAT IS KNOWN RESPECTING THE SOLIDIFICATION OF FLUIDS IT IS THUS DEFECTIVE FROM APPEAR ING TO INVOLVE AN UNPROVED AND IMPROBABLE PHYSICAL LAW ITS EXCLUSION FIOM THE HYPOTHESIS WILL MAKE THE LATTER MORE GENERAL AND MORE APPLICABLE TO THE EXPLANATION OF CERTAIN COSMICAL PHENOMENA MAKING THE SIMPLIFIED HYPOTHESIS THE BASIS OF MY INVESTIGATIONS IT SHALL BE THEIR OBJECT FURTHER TO GENERALIZE THE THEORY OF THE FIGURE OF THE EARTH AND TO EXAMINE THE NATURE AND THE ENERGY OF THE PHYSICAL AND MECHANICAL ACTIONS WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN EXERTED UPON ITS SURFACE DURING ITS DIFFERENT GEOLOGICAL TRANSFORMATIONS 3S2MR HENNESSYS RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS 2 LET THE EARTH BE CONSIDERED TO HAVE BEEN ORIGINALLY A HETEROGENEOUS FLUID MASS POSSESSING ONLY SUCTH GENERAL PROPERTIES AS THOSE WHICH HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR FLUIDS LET X Y Z BE THE RECTANGULAR COORDINATES OF P AN ELEMENTARY MOLECULE OF THE FLUID AND LET THE COMPONENTS OF THE FORCES PARALLEL

AXIS OF Z PASS THROUGH THE CENTRE OF GRAVITY THENT M 2 Y2 THE NUMERATOR AT THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ABOVE EQUATION IS EVIDENTLY CONSTANT AND THE DENOMINATOR IS A QUANTITY DEPENDING UPON THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE MOLECULES OF THE FLUID ABOUT THE CENTRE OF GRAVITY OF THE ENTIRE MASS LET I REPRESENT THE VALUE OF PXZ2Y2 WHEN A WAS THE ANGULAR VELOCITY OF ROTATION OF THE BODY AND LET I BE ITS VALUE CORRESPONDING TO AN ANGULAR VELOCITY OF ROTATION DENOTED BY A IF A SHOULD NOT BE KNOWN INDEPENDENTLY BUT IF I I AND A BE KNOWN THEN THE EQUATION TO THE FREE SURFACE OF THE FLUID CAN BE TRANSFORMED INTO XD YDYZDZ XDX YDY 0  1 IN ANY SOLUTIONS HERETOFORE GIVEN OF THE PROBLEM OF THE DETERMINATION OF THE FIGURE IT2 OF THE EARTH THE COEFFICIENT I SEEMS NOT TO HAVE BEEN NOTICED FROM THE NATURE OF THE ASSUMPTION WHICH HAS BEEN MENTIONED IN ART 1 WHEN X Y Z ARE THE COMPONENTS PRODUCED BY THE MUTUAL ATTRACTIONS OF THE MOLECULES OF THE FLUID ACCORDING TO A CERTAIN FUNCTION OF X Y Z THEN THE VALUES OF X Y Z WILL IN GENERAL DEPEND UPON THE FORM OF THE ENTIRE MASS AND OF ITS SURFACES OF EQUILIBRIUM AND AGAIN THAT FORM WILL DEPEND UPON THE VALUES OF THE COMPONENTS AND OF D AS THE VALUE OF I DEPENDS UPON THE FORM OF THE MASS IT MUST ALSO DEPEND UPON X Y Z BUT IT MAY BE CONSIDERED INDEPENDENTLY IF THE CONDITIONS UPON WHICH ANY PARTICULAR SOLUTION OF EQUATION 1 IS TO BE MADE ARE SUCH AS TO ASSIGN WHAT FUNC TION IT MAY BE OF THE COORDINATES CONSIDERED UNDER THIS POINT OF VIEW THE THREE FIRST TERMS AND THE FOURTH OR LAST TERM AT THE LEFT SIDE OF THE EQUATION 1 MAY BE I12 CONSIDERED AS

COEFFICIENT AFFECTING AC2 OF SUCH A NATURE AS TO SATISFY THE EQUATION  2 3 IN ORDER TO ARRIVE AT A SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM OF THE FIGURE OF THE EARLTH IT HAS BEEN FOUND NECESSARY TO SUPPOSE THAT THE PRIMITIVE FLUID MASS DEVIATED BUT LITTLE FROM THE SPHERICAL FORM IF THE SPHEROID BE IN ROTATION IT MUST FOLLOW THAT ITS AXIS OF ROTA TION SHOULD BE THAT ONE OF ALL THE AXES PASSING THROUGH THE CENTRE OF GRAVITY WITH RESPECT TO WHICH THE SUM OF THE FORCES ACTING UPON THE SYSTEM WOULD BE A MAXIMUM THIS AXIS MAY THEREFORE BE SUPPOSED TO COINCIDE VERY NEARLY WITH THE POSITION OF THE PRESENT AXIS IF NO OTHER FORCES BE SUPPOSED TO ACT UPON THE MASS BUT THE MUTUAL ATTRACTIONS OF ITS MOLECULES AND CENTRIFUGAL FORCE THEN EQUATION 1 WILL RIGOROUSLY REPRESENT THE GENERAL EQUATION OF ITS SURFACE AND THE CONSIDERATION OF ITS PHYSICAL OR MECHANICAL CHANGES COULD BE TREATED WITH LESS DIFFICULTY WHATEVER MAY BE THE CAUSE OF THE PRIMITIVE FLUIDITY OF THE EARTH AND WHATEVER MAY BE THE NATURE OF THE PROCESS OF SOLIDIFICATION BY WHICH AT LEAST A PORTION OF IT HAS ARRIVED AT A SOLID STATE IF THAT PROCESS SHOULD BE SUCH THAT A SHELL WOULD BE FIRST FORMED SURROUNDING A NUCLEUS OF MATTER IN A STATE OF FLUIDITY AND IF SOLIDIFICATION BE ACCOMPANIED BY A CHANGE IN DENSITY OF THE MATTER SOLIDIFIED IT APPEARS THAT SOME CHANGE WOULD BE PRODUCED IN THE MOTIONS OF THE ENTIRE MASS ABOUT ITS AXIS AND IN THE ARRANGEMENT AND COMPOSITION OF THAT PORTION OF THE FLUID CONSTITUTING THE NUCLEUS THE MANNER IN WHICH FROM PHYSICAL OR CHEMICAL CAUSES THE SOLIDIFYING PROCESS MAY PROCEED WILL TO A GREAT EXTENT DETERMINE WHAT MAY BE THE ACTIONS MUTUALLY EXERCISED BY THE NUCLEUS AND SHELL THE COMBINATION OF SUCH ACTIONS WITH THE CHANGES WHICH MAY HAVE OCCURRED IN THE VELOCITY OF ROTATION OF THE MASS WILL BE THUS KNOWN AND THEIR INFLUENCE UPON THE GEOLOGICAL PHENOMENA OCCURRING DURING THE DIFFERENT EPOCHS OF THE PHYSICAL HISTORY OF THE EARTH CAN BE THUS APPRECIATED IN THIS WAY IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO CARRY OUR IDEAS BACK TO THE REMOTER PERIODS OF THE EARTHS EXISTENCE AND TO ASSIST IN EXPLAINING THE PHENOMENA WHICH GEOLOGICAL OBSERVERS ARE CONSTANTLY UN FOLDING THE APPLICATION OF PHYSICAL AND MECHANICAL SCIENCE TO QUESTIONS CONNECTED WITH GEOLOGY HAS BEEN MADE ONLY WITHIN A COMPARATIVELY RECENT PERIOD AND THE SUBJECT SEEMS YET TO REQUIRE A MORE COMPLETE SYSTEMATIZING IN ORDER TO BRING IT INTO THE CLASS OF SCIENCES WHICH BELONG PROPERLY TO WHAT MAY BE CALLED THE MECHANICS OF THE UNI VERSE AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS CONNECTING GEOLOGY WITH PHYSICAL ASTRONOMY HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE BY MR HOPKINS IN HIS RESEARCHES CONCERNING THE CONSTITUTION AND THICKNESS OF THE PRESENT SOLID SHELL OF THE GLOBE ONE OF THE OBJECTS OF THE PRESENT MEMOIR WILL BE FULFILLED IF IT SHOULD IN ANY WAY TEND TO INCREASE THAT CONNEXION 4 ADOPTING IN ITS GREATEST GENERALITY THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE EARTH WAS ORIGINALLY A FLUID MASS IN ROTATION THE PARTICLES OF WHICH ATTRACTED EACH OTHER WITH FORCES VARY ING INVERSELY AS THE SQUARES OF THEIR DISTANCES AND THAT THE FIGURE OF THE MASS WAS NEARLY SPHERICAL IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO PROCEED WITH THE GENERAL INVESTIGATION OF THE 497MR HENNESSYS RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS FIGURE WHICH THE FORCES ACTING ON ITS DIFFERENT PARTS WOULD ULTIMATELY PRODUCE WITH OUT ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE PECULIAR PHYSICAL NATURE OF THE FLUID IT APPEARS TO BE SUFFICIENTLY DEMONSTRATED THAT THE FIGURE WHICH SUCH A FLUID MASS WOULD ASSUME IN VIRTUE OF THE MUTUAL ATTRACTIONS OF ITS PARTICLES AND OF CENTRIFUGAL FORCE WOULD BE AN ELLIPSOID OF REVOLUTION IT IS SUPERFLUOUS THEREFORE TO ENTER UPON THAT PORTION OF THE SUBJECT ASSUMING THEN THE FIGURE OF THE MASS TO BE AN ELLIPSOID OF REVOLUTION I SHALL ENDEAVOUR TO OBTAIN GENERAL EXPRESSIONS FOR ITS ELLIPTICITY AND FOR THE VARIATION

ALL THAT IT MAY BE AT PRESENT POSSIBLE TO DEDUCE FROM THE IMPROVED HYPOTHESIS OF THE PRIMITIVE STATE OF THE EARTH WITH RELATION TO ITS FIGURE AND TO THE VARIATION OF GRAVITY AT ITS SURFACE IT MAY BE HEREAFTER POSSIBLE TO ASSIGN TO THE QUANTITIES ENTERING P A IN EQUATION 5 SUCH VALUES DEDUCED FROM CONSIDERING THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE PRIMITIVE FLUID AS WOULD ENABLE US TO FIND A NUMERICAL VALUE FOR THE ELLIPTICITY 6 IN ART 3 A SHORT GENERAL SKETCH HAS BEEN GIVEN OF THE CONSEQUENCES WHICH MAY RESULT FROM THE IMPROVED HYPOTHESIS OF THE PRIMITIVE FLUIDITY OF THE EARTH TO PHY SICAL GEOLOGY OR TO THE CHANGES OCCURRING UPON THE EXTERNAL CRUST OF THE EARTH DURING MDCCCLI 3 T 501MR HENNESSYS RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS THE PROCESS OF ITS SOLIDIFICATION IT IS NOW PROPOSED TO COMMENCE THE INVESTIGATION OF THESE GEOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES BEFORE PROCEEDING TO THE PURELY MATHEMATICAL PORTIONS OF THIS INVESTIGATION IT SEEMS NECESSARY THAT SOME PRELIMINARY REMARKS SHOULD BE MADE ON THE NATURE OF THE SOLIDIFICATION OF THE GLOBE IT SEEMS THE MORE NECESSARY THAT THESE REMARKS SHOULD BE NOW GIVEN AS THEY WILL NOT PROBABLY BE FOUND TO AGREE ENTIRELY WITH THOSE WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE SAME SUBJECT BY AN EMINENT GEOLOGIST AND GEOMETER IT IS HOWEVER SATISFACTORY TO REFLECT THAT EVEN IF MY VIEWS RESPECTING THE SOLIDIFICATION OF THE EARTH SHOULD BE MORE CORRECT THAN THOSE OF MR HOPKINS THE REAL VALUE OF THAT GENTLEMANS RESEARCHES WILL STILL REMAIN UNALTERED ALTHOUGH UNTIL NOW NO ALLUSION HAS BEEN MADE TO THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE PRI MITIVE FLUIDITY OF THE EARTH IT BECOMES NECESSARY IN ORDER TO PROCEED WITH THE GEOLO GICAL PORTION OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS THAT THIS CAUSE SHOULD BE ASSIGNED INTENSE HEAT IS THAT WHICH IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE THE CAUSE AND WHICH THE ADVOCATES OF THE EARTHS CENTRAL HEAT SEEM TO SUPPORT BY NUMEROUS FACTS THE SOLIDIFICATION OF THIS HEATED MASS OF FLUID IS SO CONNECTED WITH ITS REFRIGERATION THAT SOME REMARKS ON THE LATTER SUBJECT MUST ACCOMPANY OR PRECEDE ANY INVESTIGATIONS ABOUT THE FORMER IF THE WHOLE EARTH FROM THE ACTION OF A HIGH TEMPERATURE WERE REDUCED TO THAT STATE OF FLUIDITY WHICH FORMS THE GROUNDWORK OF THE HYPOTHESIS UPON WHICH THE THEORY OF ITS FIGURE IS FOUNDED IT APPEARS PROBABLE THAT THE FLUID MASS WOULD BE EXTREMELY HETEROGENEOUS CHEMICALLY AS WELL AS MECHANICALLY NEW CHEMICAL COMBINATIONS WOULD BE FORMED OF WHOSE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO FORM AN ACCU RATE IDEA AFTER THE MOST ENERGETIC COMBINING TENDENCIES OF THE DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES COMPOSING THE FLUID WOULD HAVE BEEN SATISFIED THE MASS MAY BE SUPPOSED TO HAVE ARRIVED AT A STATE OF COMPARATIVE CHEMICAL STABILITY SUCH PROPERTIES OF THE DIFFERENT COMPOUNDS AS DENSITY AND COMPRESSIBILITY WOULD THEN EXERT A DIRECT INFLUENCE UPON THE NATURE OF THEIR ARRANGEMENT AROUND THE CENTRE OF GRAVITY OF THE SPHEROID EVERY PORTION OF THE FLUID DENSER THAN THE STRATUIM IN WHICH FROMRT ANY CAUSE IT MAY HAPPEN TO BE WOULD SINK UNTIL IT WOULD MEET A STRATUM OF EQUAL DENSITY THE LIGHT PORTIONS OF THE FLUID WHICH MAY HAPPEN TO BE IN HEAVIER STRATA THAN THEMSELVES WOULD ON THE CONTRARY ASCEND UNTIL EQUILIBRIUM WOULD BE OBTAINED THE FLUID MASS WOULD THUS ARRIVE AT LENGTH AT SUCH A STATE THAT IT WOULD CONSIST OF A SERIES OF SPHEROIDAL STRATA EACH OF UNIFORM DENSITY THROUGHOUT ITS OWN MASS AND HAVING THAT DENSITY EXPRESSIBLE AS A FUNCTION OF ITS AXES AT SOME TIME AFTER THE ARRIVAL OF THE FLUID AT THIS STATE AND PERHAPS BEFORE IT POR TIONS OF ITS HEAT WOULD RADIATE IN SPACE THE EXTERIOR PORTIONS OF THE FLUID WOULD COOL FIRST UNTIL THEY WOULD ACQUIRE ACCORDING TO THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH MAY INFLUENCE THEIR COOLING CERTAIN DENSITIES IF THE EFFECT OF REFRIGERAIION BE IN GENERAL AN INCREASE IN DENSITY OF THE MATTER COOLED THEN THE COOLED PORTIONS OF THE FLUID WILL SINK THE HIGHER TEMPERATURE OF THE MATTER YET UNEXPOSED TO COOLING INFLUENCES  HOPKINS PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 1839 502MR HENNESSYS RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS WOULD THEN TEND TO CHANGE THE ACQUIRED DENSITIES OF THE COOLED MATTER THE AS YET UNCOOLED FLUID WOULD HAVE ITS TEMPERATURE REDUCED FROM CONTACT WITH THE COLD PAR TICLES FROM ABOVE AND IT WOULD TEND TO CHANGE ITS POSITION IN A SIMILAR MANNER TO THE PORTIONS AT FIRST COOLED AS EACH COOLED PORTION OF THE FLUID DESCENDS THE THREE FOLLOWING CAUSES WOULD THEREFORE IMPEDE ITS DESCENT 1 FROM THE ARRANGEMENT ALREADY INDICATED OF THE DENSER STRATA ABOUT THE CENTRE OF THE MASS AND FROM THE NATURE OF THE LAW OF DENSITY OF THE STRATA EACH STRATUM INTO WHICH THE COOLED FLUID WOULD DESCEND WOULD BE DENSER THAN THE PRECEDING 2 IF THE GENERAL EFFECT OF THE REFRIGERATION BE TO INCREASE THE DENSITY OF THE COOLED MATTER EACH STRATUM WOULD HAVE ITS DENSITY AUGMENTED BY THE PASSAGE THROUGH IT OF THE COOLER MATTER FROM ABOVE 3 THE DESCENDING PORTIONS WILL HAVE THEIR DENSITIES DIMINISHED BY THE INCREASE IN THEIR TEMPERATURE DURING THIS PROCESS OF CIRCULATION THE INTERIOR MATTER IN A STATE OF FUSION WILL BE LOSING SOME OF ITS HEAT BY CONDUCTION IT MUST BE EVIDENT HOWEVER THAT IF THE TEM PERATURE OF THE FLUID BE VERY HIGH THE COOLING WOULD BE CARRIED ON AT FIRST CHIEFLY BY THE PROCESS OF CIRCULATION IF AS ANALOGY SEEMS TO POINT OUT THE CONDUCTING POWER OF THE FLUID WERE SMALL THE PROCESS OF CIRCULATION WOULD LONG CONTINUE TO PERFORM A PRINCIPAL PART IN THE REFRIGERATION OF THE FLUID ALTHOUGH FIOM THE IMPERFECT STATE OF OUR KNOWLEDGE WITH RESPECT TO THE COOLING OF FLUIDS IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ARRIVE AT THE PRECISE LAWS AND NATURE OF THE PRO CESS OF CIRCULATION IT YET SEEMS PROBABLE FROM THE THREE IMPEDING CAUSES WHICH HAVE BEEN ADDUCED THAT THE ENERGY OF THIS PROCESS WOULD DIMINISH FROM THE SURFACE OF THE SPHEROID TO ITS CENTRE THE PRINCIPAL OSCILLATIONS OF THE FLUID PRODUCED BY THIS CAUSE WOULD THEREFORE BE ATFIRST CONFINED TO THE VICINITY OF THE SURFACE A SOLID CRUST MAY THEREFORE BE FORMED AT THE SURFACE LONG BEFORE THE PROCESS OF CIRCULATION COULD HAVE EXTENDED TO ANY GREAT DEPTHS WE SHOULD THUS HAVE AN EXTERNAL SOLID CRUST WITH STRATA OF THE IMPERFECT FLUID WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO THE PROCESS OF CIRCULATION BELOW IT AND IN THE CENTRE A MASS OF MATTER STILL RETAINING A HIGH STATE OF FLUIDITY THE EXISTENCE AT THE CENTRE OF THE SPHEROID OF A SOLID NUCLEUS OF SMALL MASS COMPARED TO THE ENTIRE MASS OF THE EARTH CANNOT AS WILL HEREAFTER APPEAR EXERCISE ANY IMPORTANT INFLUENCE ON GEOLOGICAL PHENOMENA IF FROM COMPRESSION OR ANY OTHER CAUSE THIS SOLID NUCLEUS SHOULD EXIST IT IS EVIDENT THAT SOLIDIFICATION WOULD PROCEED MUCH MORE SLOWLY UPON IT UPWARDS THAN UPON THE INTERIOR SURFACE OF THE SHELL DOWNWARDS OR IN OTHER WORDS THE INCREASE OF ITS TNASS AFTER ITS FIRST FORMATION WOULD BE SMALL COMPARED TO THE INCREASE OF THE MASS OF THE SHELL SUBSEQUENT TO ITS FIRST SOLIDIFICATION WHETHER SUCH AN INTERNAL SOLID NUCLEUS EXISTS OR NOT CERTAIN PHENOMENA WILL ATTEND THE FORMATION OF THE SHELL WHICH IT MAY BE IMPORTANT TO REMARK FROM WHAT IS KNOWN RESPECTING THE SOLIDIFICATION OF FUSED SUBSTANCES IT MAY BE INFERRED THAT AT THE MOMENT WHEN A PORTION OF THE FLUID ASSUMES THE SOLID 3T2 503MR HENNESSYS RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS STATE A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF LATENT HEAT WILL BE ELIMINATED A PORTION OF THIS HEAT WILL PASS UPWARDS THROUGH THE SHELL AND ANOTHER PORTION WILL PASS INTO THE IM PERFECT FLUID IMMEDIATELY BELOW TENDING TO BRING IT BACK TO A STATE OF MORE PERFECT FLUIDITY IF THE QUANTITY OF LATENT HEAT THUS ELIMINATED SHOULD BE GREAT IT MAY EXERT AN INFLUENCE IN CHANGING THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE PARTS OF THE SHELL WHICH IT MAY BE HEREAFTER USEFUL TO CONSIDER THE EFFECT OF THE ELIMINATION OF LATENT HEAT UPON THE PROCESS OF CIRCULATION WOULD BE EVIDENTLY SUCH AS TO RENDER THAT PROCESS STILL MORE COMPLEX THAN WHAT IT WAS BEFORE AND ITS EXAMINATION WOULD THUS BE ATTENDED WITH STILL MORE DIFFICULTY AND UNCERTAINTY A VERY ACCURATE EXAMINATION OF THIS PORTION OF THE PHIENOMENA ATTENDING THE EARTHS REFRIGERATION APPEARS NOT TO BE NECESSARY FOR THE PRESENT AND IT WILL BE FOUND MNOST CONVENIENT TO DEFER ITS CONSIDERATION IF IT SHOULD BE REQUIRED IN ANY FUTURE PORTION OF THESE RESEARCHES 7 THE MOTIONS OF THE SHELL AND INTERNAL FLUID MATTER AND THEIR MUTUAL ACTIONS DEPEND SO MUCH UPON THE ARRANGEMNENT OF THE MOLECULES OF THE PRIMNITIVE FLUID MASS THAT IT WOULD BE DESIRABLE BEFORE ATTEMLPTING THEIR INVESTIGATION TO FORM IF POSSIBLE A FEW PRECISE IDEAS RESPECTING THE LAST MENTIONED SUBJECT THE RESULTS WHICH MAY BE THUS OBTAINED WITH RESPECT TO THE DIMENSIONS AND LAW OF DENSITY OF THE PRIMITIVE FLUID WILL ALSO ENABLE US TO FIND THE PROBABLE VALUES FOR P A OR Q WHICH SHOULD BE SUBSTITUTED IN THIS CASE RESPECTIVELY IN EITHER EQUATIONS 5 OR 6 IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE ELLIPTICITY OF THE SPHEROID LET THE MASS BE SUPPOSED TO HAVE ARRIVED AT THE STATE ALLUDED TO IN THE FOREGOING ARTICLE WHEN  IT WOULD CONSIST OF A SERIES OF SPHEROIDAL STRATA EACH OF UNIFORM DENSITY THROUGHOUT ITS OWN MASS AND HAVING THAT DENSITY EXPRESSIBLE AS A FUNCTION OF ITS AXES EACH STRATUM WOULD HAVE TO SUSTAIN THE NORMAL PRESSURES OF ALL THE STRATA ABOVE IT WHETHER THESE PRESSURES BE PRODUCED BY THE ACTION OF GRAVITY OR OTHER CAUSES THE COMPRESSIVE FORCE EXERCISED BY THE UPPER STRATA UPON THOSE FARTHER FROM THE SURFACE WOULD TEND TO INCREASE THE DENSITY OF THE LATTER HOW FAR THIS IN CREASE OF DENSITY FROM COMPRESSION MAY PROCEED WITHOUT SOLIDIFICATION WE HAVE NO PRECISE EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE BY WHICH TO JUDGE THE CELEBRATED EXPERIMENTS OF SIR JAMES HALL APPEAR HOWEVER TO SHOW THAT FROM THE ACTION OF A GREAT COMN PRESSIVE FORCE MATTER IN A FUSED STATE MAY VERY NEARLY RETAIN THE VOLUME AND THERE FORE THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY WHICH IT HAD WHEN SOLID IF FROM THE COMBINED ACTION OF INCREASED PRESSURE AND INCREASED TEMPERATURE THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF THE MATTER SHOULD BE AUGMENTED WHILE ITS FLUIDITY SHOULD BE RETAINED IT WOULD FULFIL THE CONDI TIONS OF THE HYPOTHESIS MADE IN EXPLANATION OF THE EARTHS FIGURE IF IT CAN BE ASSUMED THAT THE SUBSTANCES COMPOSING THOSE PORTIONS OF THE GLOBE INACCESSIBLE TO OBSERVERS ARE SIMILAR IN CONSTITUTION TO THOSE WHICH ARE FOUND AT THE SURFACE THIS PORTION OF THE SUBJECT APPEARS TO BE SUSCEPTIBLE OF EXPERIMENTAL EXAMINATION UNTIL SUCH AN EX AMINATION SALL HAVE BEEN MADE THE MASS MAY BE SUPPOSED TO HAVEMA MAS AN ARRANGEMENT SUCH AS THAT INDICATED IN ART 6 IF A SOLID NUCLEUS OF COMPARATIVELY SMALL MASS 504MR HENNESSYS RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS SHOULD BE FORMED THE DENSITIES OF ITS STRATA MAY BE SUPPOSED SUCH AS TO BE EX PRESSIBLE ACCORDING TO THE SAME FUNCTION OF THEIR AXES AS THE DENSITIES OF THE FLUID STRATA LET THE FLUID MASS BE CONCEIVED TO CONSIST OF AN INFINITE NUMBER OF PYRAMIIDS OR COLUMNS MEETING AT ITS CENTRE LET IN CONFORMITY

APPROXIMATIONS MAY BE SUBSTITUTED IN 9 WHENCE THE VALUE OF A CAN BE OBTAINED BY MEANS OF THE OPERATIONS ABOVE INDICATED IF SUFFICIENT DATA EXISTED SOME KNOW LEDGE COULD BE OBTAINED OF THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE MOLECULES OF THE PRIMITIVE FLUID ABOUT THEIR CENTRE OF GRAVITY AT PRESENT NO EXPERIMENTAL DATA APPEAR TO EXIST BY WHICH NUMERICAL VALUES COULD BE ASSIGNED TO C OR 1 THE EXPERIMENTS OF MM COLLADON AND STURM SHOW THAT THE COMPRESSIBILITIES OF DIFFERENT LIQUIDS VARY CONSIDERABLY ACCORDING TO THEIR PHYSICAL PROPERTIES IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE THEREFORE FROM ANA LOGY WITH THEIR EXPERIMENTS OR THOSE OF M CERSTED TO FORM ANY ACCURATE IDEA OF THE COMPRESSIBILITY OF THE FLUID CONSTITUTING THE EARTH WHEN IN ITS SUPPOSED STATE OF FUSION THE CALCULATION OF A PRECISE VALUE FOR N OR A SEEMS THEN TO BE AT PRESENT IMPOSSIBLE BUT GEOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS APPEAR TO IMPOSE CERTAIN LIMITS ON THE VALUE WHICH A MAY HAVE HAD THE VALUE OF A MAY HAVE BEEN EQUAL TO OR GREATER OR LESS THAN THE PRESENT SEMIPOLAR AXIS OF THE EARTH IF IT WERE GREATER THE DIFFERENCE SHOULD BE SMALL COMPARED TO ITS WHOLE LENGTH FOR IF THIS DIFFERENCE WERE GREAT THE EXTERNAL SHELL FIRST FORMED SHOULD NO MATTER FROM WHAT CAUSE ARRIVE AT ITS PRESENT DITNENSIONS AND IN DOING SO IT WOULD HAVE TO UNDERGO IMMEINSE CONTORTIONS OF WHOSE EXISTENCE NO EVIDENCE CAN BE ADDUCED IF A SURFACE BE CONCEIVED TO PASS THROUGH THE CENTRES OF GRAVITY OF THE INFINITE NUMBER OF PYRAMIDAL SEGMENTS INTO WHICH WE MAY CONCEIVE THE SHELL TO BE DIVIDED IT IS EVIDENT THAT ALL OF THESE SEGMENTS COULD NOT DESCEND BELOW THAT SURFACE OR COULD NOT ALL APPROACH IN THE SAME DEGREE TOWARDS THE CENTRE OF THE MASS THE SHELL SHOULD BE BROKEN IN MANY PLACES TO PERMIT THE DISPLACEMENT OF THE SEGMENTS AS THE AMOUNT OF COMMON DISPLACEMENT FROM THE CONTRACTION OF THE SHELL BY REFRIGERATION WOULD NOT EFFECT THE REDUCTION OF ITS DIMENSIONS TO THOSE WHICH IT HAS AT PRESENT THE IRREGULARITIES OF THE SURFACE OF THE FRACTURED SHELL WOULD EVIDENTLY BE IN PROPORTION TO ITS PRIMITIVE AXES IF A WERE LESS THAN THE PRESENT SEMIPOLAR AXIS OF THE EARTH THEN IN ORDER THAT THE EXTERNAL COAT OF THE SHELL FIRST FORMED SHOULD ARRIVE AT ITS PRESENT DIMENSIONS IT SHOULD RECEIVE ADDITIONS IN SOME PARTS IF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A AND THE PRESENT SEMIPOLAR AXIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT THE EFFECT OF THE CONTRACTION OF THE SHELL FROM REFRIGERATION MAY AS IN THE FOREGOING PARAGRAPH BE NEGLECTED FROM SOME CAUSE NO MATTER WHAT THE EARTHS MASS SHOULD EXPAND AND IN THE EXPANSION RENTS WOULD BE PRODUCED IN THE SHELL THESE EMPTY SPACES MAY BE AFTERWARDS FILLED UP WITH INJECTED MATTER PUSHED FORWARD BY FURTHER EXPANSION DURING THE SUBSEQUENT FORMATION OF THE UNDER STRATA OF THE SHELL THE ENTIRE SHELL FORMED OF THE CEMENTED PORTIONS OF THE FIRST SOLIDIFIED MASS AND THE NEW COATS OF MATTER ADDED FROM WITHIN MAY BE AGAIN RUPTURED AND A PROCESS SIMILAR TO THE FIRST MAY BE AGAIN REPEATED AS THE WHOLE SHELL WOULD INCREASE IN THICKNESS THE EXTENT AND FREQUENCY OF THESE RUPTURES WOULD PROBABLY LESSEN AS WHATEVER MAY BE THE MECHANICAL ACTION PRODUCING THEM IT WOULD THEN HAVE AN INCREASED RESISTANCE TO OVERCOME THE EJECTED MATTER WHICH WOULD ARRIVE AT THE SURFACE WOULD ALSO PROBABLY NOT AMALGATNATE SO COMPLETELY WITH THE PER 506MR HENNESSYS RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS FECTLY COOLED SOLIDIFIED MATTER THERE AS THE MATTER FORMERLY EJECTED DID WHEN THE SOLID SURFACE WAS ITSELF AT A VERY HIGH TEMPERATURE FROM THE FOREGOING CONSIDERA TIONS IT APPEARS THAT A VALUE OF A1 LESS THAN THE PRESENT SEMIPOLAR AXIS OF THE EARTH WOULD BE AT LEAST AS MUCH IN ACCORDANCE WITH OBSERVED GEOLOGICAL PHENOMENA AS A VALUE GREATER THAN THAT SEMIAXIS THE PROTRUSION OF THE PRIMARY AND IGNEOUS ROCKS THROUGH THE STRATA COMPOSING THE EXTERNAL CRUST OF THE EARTH WOULD BE IN SOME MEASURE A NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE OF THE SMALLER VALUE OF A AND IT WOULD NOT FOLLOW THAT THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH SHOULD NECESSARILY UNDERGO ANY GREAT CONTORTIONS IN EITHER OF THE CASES WHICH HAVE BEEN JUST EXAMINED THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE MOLECULES CONSTITUTING THE FLLID GLOBE SHOULD BE DIFFERENT FROM THEIR PRESENT ARRANGE MENT THEIR ARRANGEMENT MAY OR MAY NOT BE DIFFERENT IF THE VALUE OF AL COINCIDED WITH THE PRESENT SEMIPOLAR AXIS OF THE EARTH IN SO FAR AS THE VALUE OF A WOULD HAVE ANY INFLUENCE UPON THAT ARRANGEMENT IF THE DIMENSIONS OF THE GLOBE HAD BEEN INCREASING IN THE MANNER WHICH SHOULD HAPPEN IF A HAD AT FIRST A SMALL VALUE THE RATE OF THAT INCREASE COULD BE DETERMINED BY FINDING THE AREAS OF THE FISSURES THROUGH WHICH THE FUSED MATTER MAY HAVE BEEN EJECTED DURING THE PROGRESS OF THE DIFFERENT GEOLOGICAL FORMATIONS THE GEOMETRICAL RELATIONS BETWEEN THE STURFACE OF THE SPHEROID AND ITS AXES WOULD EVIDENTLY BE OF SONLE ASSISTANCE IN THE COURSE OF SUCH AN INVESTIGATION IF THE SUM OF THE AREAS OF THESE FISSURES WAS SMALL COMPARED WITH THAT OF THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH THEN IT MAY BE GENERALLY CONCLUDED THAT A COULD NOT BE MUCH LESS THAN THE PRESENT SEMIPOLAR AXIS OF THE TERRESTRIAL SPHEROID THE THREE FOLLOWING GENERAL CONCLUSIONS MAY BE NOW STATED AS DEDUCTIONS FROM THE FOREGOING REMARKS 1 IF A WERE GREATER THAN THE PRESENT SEMIPOLAR AXIS OF THE EARTH THE DIFFERENCE SHOULD BE SMALL 2 IF A WERE LESS THAN THAT SEMIAXIS IT BECOMES MORE DIFFICULT TO ASSIGN A LIMIT TO THEIR DIFFERENCE BUT IT APPEARS PROBABLE THAT THIS DIFFERENCE WOULD BE GREATER THAN WHAT IT WOULD BE IN THE FOREGOING CASE 3 THE VALUE OF A MAY BE IDENTICAL WITH THAT OF THE PRESENT SEMIPOLAR AXIS WITHOUT CONTRADICTING ANY PROPERTIES OF THE PRIMITIVE FLUID MASS OF WHICH WE MAY BE AWARE OR WITHOUT DISCORDANCE WITH GEOLOGICAL PHENOMENA IN ORDER THAT THE VALUE OF A SHOULD BE GREATER THAN THE PRESENT SEMIPOLAR AXIS IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE FLUID SHOULD HAVE EITHER A LOW DENSITY OR A SMALL COMPRESSIBILITY IF A WERE ON THE CONTRARY MUCH LESS THAN THAT SEMIAXIS THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF THE FLUID SHOULD BE HIGH OR ITS COMPRESSIBILITY SHOULD BE GREAT IF A WERE EQUAL TO THE SEMI POLAR AXIS THE FLUIDS COMPRESSIBILITY SHOULD STILL BE SMALL COMPARED WITH THOSE OF ALL THE FLUIDS EXCEPT MERCURY UPON WHICH EXPERIMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE UNLESS ITS DENSITY WERE MUCH LESS THAN THE MEAN DENSITY OF THE PRESENT EXTERNAL CRUST OF THE EARTH THE ABOVE CONSIDERATIONS IN ADDITION TO WHAT HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY PRESENTED APPEAR TO PROVE THAT A COULD NOT MUCH EXCEED THE PRESENT SEMIPOLAR AXIS OF THE EARTH AND 507MR HENNESSYS RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS THAT IF A DIFFERED IN ANY WAY FROM THAT SEMIAXIS THE DIFFERENCE WOULD MOST PROBABLY BE OWING TO THE COMPARATIVE SMALLNESS OF A 8 THE APPLICATION OF EQUATIONS 5 OR 6 TO THE DETERMINATIONS OF THE EARTHS ELLIP TICITY MAY NOW BE ATTEMPTED BEFORE PROCEEDING TO ANY FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS IN MAKING USE OF 6 OR ANY OTHER SIMILAR EQUATION FOR THE DETERMINATION OF THE ELLIP TICITY OF THE SPHEROID THE NUMERICAL RESULTS SHOULD BE ALWAYS CONSIDERED AS HYPOTHE TICAL SUCH AN EQUATION COULD NOT GIVE THE PRESENT ELLIPTICITY UNLESS THAT WHICH THE EARTH HAD IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SOLIDIFICATION OF THE OUTER COAT OF THE SHELL HAD REMAINED UNALTERED IT IS NOT IMPROBABLE THAT MANY CAUSES MAY HAVE EXISTED TO PRO DUCE SUCH AN ALTERATION IF FROM ANY CAUSE THE FLUID NUCLEUS EXERTED UNEQUAL PRESSURES UPON DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE SHELL IT IS EVIDENT THAT THEIR TENDENCY WOULD BE TO ALTER ITS FORM IT IS POSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE THAT ANY ALTERATION SO PRODUCED IN THE FIGURE OF THE EARTH MAY CONSIST IN A REDUCTION AS WELL AS IN AN INCREASE OF ITS ELLIPTICITY IN A MORE ADVANCED STAGE OF THESE RESEARCHES I MAY BE ABLE TO FULLY CONSIDER THE INFLUENCE OF SUCH CAUSES IT IS ENOUGH FOR THE PRESENT TO POINT OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF THEIR EXISTENCE IF IT BE ADMITTED THAT THE CAUSES WHICH HAVE BEEN REFERRED TO IN THE FOREGOING PARA GRAPHS ARE OF SUFFICIENT IMPORTANCE TO PRODUCE APPRECIABLE CHANGES IN THE GENERAL FIGURE OF THE EARTH IT MUST APPEAR AT LEAST A DOUBTFUL ASSUMPTION TO ASSIGN TO N SUCH A VALUE IN THE EXPRESSION FOR THE DENSITY OF THE STRATA OF THE PRIMITIVE FLUID AS THAT WHICH WOULD GIVE PRECISELY THE SAME ELLIPTICITY AS THE PRESENT IN ORDER TO ILLUSTRATE THE APPLICATION OF EQUATION 6 AND TO SHOW THAT FROM ITS FORM A CHANGE IN THE VALUE OF N CAN MAKE BUT A COMPARATIVELY SMALL CHANGE IN THE VALUE OF E I SHALL NOW PROCEED TO FIND AN EXPRESSION FOR Q IF THE DIMENSIONS OF THE FLUID MASS BE SUPPOSED TO BE THE SAME AS THOSE OF THE EARTH AT PRESENT THEN G WILL BE THE SAME AS G GRAVITY AT THE PERIOD OF ITS FLUID STATE IT IS EVIDENT THAT A CAN BE EXPRESSED UNDER THE FORM  A IA WHERE WBEE E

MAKING USE OF EITHER 6 OR 11 A QUANTITY P IS INTRODUCED WHICH DEPENDS UPON CERTAIN NUMBERS OBTAINED FROM OBSERVATION ONE OF THESE NUMBERS IS THE RATIO OF THE EARTHS MIASS TO THAT OF THE MOON AND SOME UNCERTAINTY SEEMS YET TO EXIST AS TO ITS VALUE  THE RESULTS OBTAINED FROM USING IN 6 OR 11 THE DIFFERENT VALUES OF THIS NUMBER WHICH MAY BE OBTAINED BY DIFFERENT METHODS ARE MUCH AFFECTED BY THEIR DIFFERENCES IN ORDER TO COMPARE EQUATION 6 WITH THAT USED IN THE M6CANIQUE C6LESTE FOR FINDING THE EARTHS ELLIPTICITY THE FOLLOWING CALCULATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE IF THE EQUATION IN THE MECANIQUE C6LESTE

WOULD AT LENGTH ESTABLISH AN UNIFORM MOTION FOR THE WHOLE MASS THE DIRECT INFLUENCE WHICH THE ROTATORY MOTION OF THE SHELL AND NUCLEUS MAY EXERCISE UPON GEOLOGICAL PHENOMENA WILL NOT REQUIRE THEREFORE THE MOTIONS OF BOTH TO BE SEPARATELY CONSIDERED THE EXAMINATION OF THE MOTIONS OF THE SHELL AND NUCLEUS AND OF THEIR MUTUAL ACTIONS WHETHER DIRECTLY OR FROM THE INFLUENCE OF EXTERIOR DISTURBING CAUSES MAY THEREFORE BE COMPREHENDED UNDER THE FOLLOWING DIVISIONS 1 THE PHENOMENA ATTENDING THE ROTATION OF THE ENTIRE MASS DURING THE GRADUAL SOLIDIFICATION OF THE SHELL 2 THE PRESSURES EXERTED BY THE FLUID UPON THE INTERIOR SURFACE OF THE SHELL WHETHER FROM MOLECULAR ACTION THE AGENCY OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES OR FROM CENTRIFUGAL FORCE 3 THE INFLUENCE OF THE CHANGES OF TEMPERATURE WHICH MAY OCCUR DURING THE SOLI DIFICATION OF THE SHELL IN CONTRACTING OR EXPANDING ITS PARTS AND IN PRODUCING PLHYSICAL CHANGES IN ITS INTERIOR STRUCTURE FROM THE INTIMATE CONNEXION BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND OF THE ABOVE DIVISIONS IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO EXAMINE ONE OF THEM IN A PERFECTLY GENERAL MANNER WITHOUT INTRODUCING THE CONSIDERATION OF THE OTHER THE COMPLETE CONSIDERATION OF BOTH COULD WITH GREAT ADVANTAGE BE TREATED IN ANOTHER MEMOIR THAT IN THE PRESENT AND I HOPE SOON TO HAVE IT IN MY POWER TO COMPLETE ALL THE NECESSARY INVESTIGATIONS IT WILL BE ENOUGH FOR THE PRESENT TO INDICATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE FIRST DIVISION IN A GEOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW BY REFERRING TO ONE OF THE PHENOMENA COMPREHENDED UNDER IT IF FRONM THE FORMATION OF THE SOLID SHELL AND FROM TTE GRADUAL DIMNINUTION IN THE MASS OF THE FLUID NUCLEUS ANY CHANGE SHOULD BE PRODUCED IN THE MOMENT OF INERTIA OF THE WHOLE MASS WITH RESPECT TO ITS AXIS OF ROTATION THE ANGULAR VELOCITY OF THE GLOBE ABOUT ITS AXIS WOULD BE CHANGED THE MANNER IN WHICH THE SOLIDIFICATION OF THE MASS MAY TAKE PLACE AND THE PROBABLE CONSTITUTION OF THE FLUID WILL DETERMINE HOW FAR SUCH A CHANGE MAY EXTEND IF SUCH A CHANGE SHOULD BE GREAT IT WOULD EXERT AN IMPORTANT INFLUENCE UPON THE MOTIONS OF THE LIQUIDS OR GASES SURROUNDING THE EARTH AND UPON A MULTITUDE OF ORGANIC PHENOMENA WHICH ITS SURFACE MAY HAVE PRESENTED AT DIFFERENT TIMES 510

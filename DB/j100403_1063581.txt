may be had for damage resulting therefrom Way v Abington Mut Fire Ins Co 166 Mass 67 43 N E 1032 55 Am St Rep 379 32 L R A 608 But where property was damaged by soot and smoke from a defective stovepipe it is held there can be no re covery Cannon v Phoenix Ins Co 110 Ga 563 35 S E 775 Where the policy stipulates against liability for loss caused by explosion the insurer will nevertheless be liable if the explosion results from a hos tile fire LaForce v Williams City Ins Co 43 Mo App 518 Here the explosion is regarded as a proximate result of the peril insured against But the opposite is true where the explosion results from a friendly fire Briggs v North American Ins Co 53 N Y 446 Mitchell v Potomac Ins Co 183 U S 42 Here the explosion is the proximate cause of the loss INTOXICATING LIQUORSALE WITHOUT A LICENSE BY A SOCIAL CLUBIN TERPRETATION OF LICENSE STATUTESA bona fide social club sold liquor to its members without first obtaining a license The State statute forbade a sale of liquor without a license Held the transaction was a sale within the meaning of the statute State v Missouri Athletic Club Mo 170 S W 904 See NoTEs p 382 OFFICERSDE JURE AND DE FACTODE JURE CLAIMANTS RIGHT TO RE COVER FEEs AFTER PAYMENT TO DE FACTO OFFICERA municipal corporation paid to a de facto officer the salary attached to his office payment being made under decree of court The de jure holder of the office then sought to recover his salary from the municipality Held he is entitled to re covery Baker v Nashua N H 91 Atl 872 By the weight of authority a de jure officer whose salary has been paid to a de facto claimant has no recourse except against the claimant himself Samuels v Hanrington 43 Wash 603 86 Pac 1071 117 Am St Rep 1075 And the same decision has been reached even where it was known that the de facto officers claim was contested and that he was insolvent Commissioners v Anderson 20 Kan 298 27 Am Rep 171 And even where both claimants were actually performing the duties of the office Walters v Paducah Ky 123 S W 287 It would seem that the majority rule is not in harmony with the legal principles applied in other cases involving the rights of de facto and de jure officers to salary and other profits The de jure officers right to his salary does not depend upon his performing the duties of the office and he may recover salary and fees paid to the de facto officer by proceeding against such officer himself U S ex rel Crawford v Addison 6 Wall 291 This rule is applied even where the de facto officer acts in good faith or under a judgment of court but in such case the de facto officer is allowed the actual expenses of performing the duties of the office Sandoval v Albright 14 N M 345 93 Pac 717 Lawrence v Wheeler 90 Kan 669 136 Pac 315 Under similar circum stances however a de facto officer who could have been penalized for failing to perform the duties of the office was allowed to retain the fees already received Five judges dissented from this decision Stuhr v Curran 44 N J L 181 43 Am Rep 353RECENT DECISIONS On the other hand the de facto officer can not compel the municipality or the State treasurer to pay him any salary for the time he has actually filled the office even where there was no de jure officer to claim the compensation Garfield Township v Crocker 63 Kan 272 65 Pac 273 Dolliver v Parks 136 Mass 499 But a number of courts have re fused to carry the doctrine so far and have allowed a de facto officer to recover where there was no de jure claimant Elledge v Whcarton 89 S C 113 71 S E 657 Since then the de jure officer is entitled to the proceeds of his office even though another performs its duties and since the de facto officer is in general not entitled to the proceeds either from the municipality or against the rightful incumbent it would seem that payment to the de facto officer is voluntary and in violation of the rights of the de jure officer and the latter should not by an act to which he is not a party be compelled to seek redress from a stranger Andrews v Portland 79 Me 484 10 Atl 458 10 Am St Rep 280 and note State v Carr 129 Ind 44 28 N E 88 28 Am St Rep 163 13 L R A 177 STATUTESCONVEYANCES AND INCUMBRANCESA statute provided that a married woman should have complete use and control of her separate property except that she should have no power to convey or incumber her real estate unless joined by her husband A married woman leased her real estate without a joinder by her husband Held the lease was neither a conveyance nor an incumbrance within the meaning of the statute Spiro v Robertson Ind App 106 N E 726 A conveyance of realty is a transfer of the legal title from the owner to another by an appropriate instrument See Abendroth v Town of Greenwich 29 Conn 356 365 At common law a married woman was prohibited from making a conveyance of her real property and where a statute removes such disability and prescribes a method by which she may dispose of it the provisions of the statute must be strictly com plied with Scott v Battle 85 N C 184 39 Am Rep 694 Bressler v Kent 61 Ill 426 14 Am Rep 67 Notwithstanding this well settled prin ciple the majority of the cases under statutes prohibiting the wife from making a conveyance without a joinder by her husband have upheld the validity of a lease though made without such joinder Sullivan v Barry 46 N J L 17 Vroom 1 Perkins v Morse 78 Me 17 2 Atl 130 57 Am Rep 780 However when the point has arisen in other connections the courts have seemingly without hesitation held a lease to be a conveyance Thus it has been held that where a statute pro hibits the husband to act as agent of the wife to convey her real es tate a lease by the husband is within the meaning of the statute San ford v Johnson 24 Minn 172 Likewise where a statute requires con veyances to be acknowledged Carlton v Williams 77 Cal 90 19 Pac 185 11 Am St Rep 243 Where a municipal corporation made a lease in a manner different from that prescribed by its charter for making conveyances the lease was held void Shriner v Inhabitants of Town of Phillipsburg 58 N J L 29 Vroom 506 33 Atl 852 Many of the statutes under which the question has arisen have given the wife the free use and control of her property as if she were a feme sole without 399

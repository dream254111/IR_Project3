SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN THE AMERICAN PHYSICAL EDUCATION REVIEW WILLIAM ORR GIVES A DISCRIMINATING STATEMENT CONCERNING THE AMOUNT AND KINDS OF EXERCISE SUITED TO THE DIFFERENT AGES AND SEXES HE MAINTAINS THE NEED OF CLOSE PERSONAL SUPERVISION AND URGES THAT ALTHOUGH THE YOUTHS CRAVING FOR ATHLETICS PROVES THEIR GENERAL UTILITY YET ESPECIALLY DURING THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF HIGH SCHOOL THERE IS GRAVE DANGER FROM OVEREXERTION IN SOME FORMS OF CONTEST AS FAR AS GIRLS ATHLETICS ARE CONCERNED MR ORR WOULD NOT ALLOW CONTESTS BETWEEN RIVAL SCHOOLS URGING THAT THE INTENSITY OF EXCITEMENT IS PSYCHICALLY

FOR ADOLESCENTS HAS BEEN COPIED IN THE WESTERN SCHOOL LOURNAL AND IS408 THE SCHOOL REVIEW RECEIVING COMMENTS FROM MANY SOURCES IT BIDS FAIR TO LEAD TO SOME PRACTICAL CONSIDERATION OF THE VALUE OF OLDFASHIONED DANCES IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS DR HALL TAKES CARE TO STATE THAT HIS STATEMENTS HAVE NO REFERENCE TO THE WALTZ AND THE TWOSTEP WHICH HE CONSIDERS WRETCHED RELICS THE REPORT OF THE MASSACHUSETTS COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE INDUSTRIAL EDU CATION STATES THAT THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN WASTE THE FIRST TWO YEARS AFTER LEAVING GRAMMAR SCHOOL AND BEFORE FINDING OCCUPATION PRESUMABLY THEY DO NOT GO TO THE

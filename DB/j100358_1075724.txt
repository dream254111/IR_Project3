of a school board for bidding pupils to play football under the auspices of the school is binding even during holiday time and away from the school ground In an article on The Place of Athletics in Secondary Schools in the American Physical Education Review William Orr gives a discriminating statement concerning the amount and kinds of exercise suited to the different ages and sexes He maintains the need of close personal supervision and urges that although the youths craving for athletics proves their general utility yet especially during the first two years of high school there is grave danger from overexertion in some forms of contest As far as girls athletics are concerned Mr Orr would not allow contests between rival schools urging that the intensity of excitement is psychically as well as physiologically injurious More than onehalf million dollars a year says the Educational Exchange of Alabama The present legislature has been generous to the schools beyond the expectation of the most sanguine friends of education And this is not counting increased appropriations to the university and several other large items The School World of London comments very critically in its last num ber on the percentage of women teachers in American public schools Figures given for some of the larger cities cities are found to be worse than more rural communities in this respect are Male Teachers Female Teachers Boston  283 1997 New York  1i166 11408 Chicago  301 5OI5 Philadelphia 1 87 3503 The article concludes with a sarcastic comment on the teaching of civics by a person who has no vote no personal acquaintance with the workings of political institutions and no interest in the political problems of the day Dr G Stanley Halls article in the Independent on Play and Dancing for Adolescents has been copied in the Western School lournal and is408 THE SCHOOL REVIEW receiving comments from many sources It bids fair to lead to some practical consideration of the value of oldfashioned dances in public schools Dr Hall takes care to state that his statements have no reference to the waltz and the twostep which he considers wretched relics The report of the Massachusetts commission to investigate industrial edu cation states that thousands of children waste the first two years after leaving grammar school and before finding occupation Presumably they do not go to the high schools because they do not find them practical enough This shows a decided opening for industrial education And now from England also comes a plea for the revival of the old countrydances such as the morris dance as a physical exercise and a train ing in graceful selfexpression for school children Mr Cecil Sharp has made a systematic study of these dances and the waterrats of London are to be collected on the playgrounds of the council schools and taught the free selfdevelopment known to openair children of earlier generations This under the leadership of the Guild of Play A reformation of the system of Latin pronunciation is under way in England The Board of Education decrees a uniform usage modeled after that approved by the Philological Societies of Oxford and Cambridge This is to be rigidly enforced in all secondary schools especially in the younger classes and should have an effect in making the English usage conform more nearly to that of other countries The adjustment of highschool work to the needs of the community as advocated by Dr G E Myers in the last Atlantic Educational Journal is going on in many places In the high school at Colorado Springs unusual attention is given to geology and chemistry because of the communitys interest in the goldmining near by The Waterford High School in a rural county of Pennsylvania gives a fouryear course in agriculture in spite of the fact that its faculty is limited to three teachers Special trade high schools in cities are another instance of this new movement in American educationa movement which is enormously rich in possibilities

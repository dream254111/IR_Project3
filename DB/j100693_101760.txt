A Register for the Airc By Nathan Hen shaw M D Fellow of the R SocietyLondon 1677in 120 THis also is a second Edition which we cannot forbear to give some account of nowconsidering the ingeniosity and usefulness of the discourse therein containedwhich wasI know not how passed over in the first Edition The Tract then contains 5 Chapters the 1st is of Fermenta tion the 2dof Chylification the 3d of Respiration the 4th of Sanguification the 5thof the Salubrity of frequent changing of Air together with a discovery of a new Method of doing it without removing from one place to another by means of an AirChamber fitted to that purpose But the main thing here undertaken by the Learnd Authoris that having considered the Air to be of some very general use and proved great quantity of Air in all mixed bodies as also that the Air of all simple bodies is capable of Dilatation or Constrictionor Rarity and Density by being more or less mo ved by the presence or absence the nearness or remoteness of the Sunhe enquireth Whether all Fermentation may not be re duced to this simple motion of the Air and doth not depend on it as on a general cause In the making out of which if he have not835 not failed he thinks it will be no difficult matter to reduce all other motions in the world to that of Fermentationand proba bly to resolve many hard Questions not as yet so rightly de termined But because Contemplations of this kind arein their own nature very unprofitable if not reducible to practise the Author hath endeavourd to apply the same to the Cure and Prevention of most Diseases IV A Philosophical Essay of MUSICK London printed for J Martyn Printer to the R Society at the Bell in St Pauls Church yard 1677in 40 THis Authors design being to explain the Nature of Musick he begins to inquire into the cause of Sound In order whereuntohe considers some of the chief phaenomena of Soundas 1 that it may be producedaccording to him in the Torricellian vacuity2that it causes motion in Solid bodiesand is diminish ed by the interposition of solid bodies 3that if the bodies in terposed are very thickits passage is wholly obstructed 4that it seems to come to the Ear in strait lines when the object is so scituated that it cannot come in a strait line to the ear 5 that when the Air is not in motion its extent is spherical and when there is a wind the sphere is enlarged on that part to which the wind blows and diminished on the contrary part 6that it arrives not to the ear in an instant but considerably flower than sight 7 that it comes as quick against the wind as with it though not so loud nor so far Hence he raises the following Hypothesis He supposes the Airwe breath in to be a mixture of different minute bodies which are of different sorts and sizes though all of them are so small as to escape our senses the grosser of them he makes Ela stical and such as are resisted by solid bodiesaltogether im pervious to them The smaller parts pass through solid bodies tho not with that ease but that upon a sudden and violent start of themthey shock the parts of solid bodies that stand in their way and also the grosser parts of the AirLastlythat there may be another degree of most subtile Ethereal parts with which the interstices of these and all other bodies are repleat which find freer passage every whereand are capable of no compressionand consequently are the medium and cause of the immediate com munication of Sight Now of these three he esteems the middle sort to be the me dium and cause of Sound and that at any time when the grosser Air is driven off any space and leaves it to be possest by these and836 and other more subtile bodies and returns by its elasticity to its former place thenare these parts extruded with violence as from the center of that place and communicate their motion as far as the sound is heard Or when any solid body is moved with a sudden and violent motion these parts must be affected thereby Foras these parts are so much resisted by solid bodies as to shock them soon the contrary they must needs be mo ved by the sudden starting of solid bodies So that according to him Sound may be caused by the trem ble of solid bodies without the presence of gross Airand also by the restitution of gross Airwhen it hath been divided with any violence Thussaith he we seethat a Bell will sound in the Tor ricellian space And when the Air is divided with any sudden forceas by the end of aWhip having all the motion of the Whip contracted in it and by a sudden turn throwing off the Air or by accensionas in Thunder and Guns or by any impression of force carrying it where other Air cannot so forcibly follow as upon compressing of Air in a bladder till it breaks or in a Pot gun a sudden crack will be caused Having laid down this Hypothesisand left his Reader to ap ply it to the aforementioned phaenomena he proceeds to the Discourse of Musick it selfand maketh it a considerable part of his business to shew How this Action that causes Sound is per formed by the several Instruments of Musick having taught his Readerfirst What a Tone is and that the Tones useful in Musick are those within the Scalein which they are placed as they have relation to one another Secondlywherein consists that Relation of Tones  the union of mixt Sounds Which done he explains how Tones are produced and what assistances are given to the Sound by Instruments Where he teaches that wherever a Body stands upon a Spring that vibrates in equal Termssuch a Body put into motionwill produce a Tone which will be more grave or acute according to the velocity of the returns Wherefore Strings vibrating have a Tone according to the Bigness or Ten sion of them and Bells that vibrate by cross Ovals produce Notes according to the bigness of them or the thickness of their sides and so do all other bodies whose superficies being displaced by force results or comes back by a spring which carries it beyond its first station And hereto make it to be un derstoodhow every pulse upon such vibrations causes Sound our Author gives us to considerthat the gross Air is thrown off by the violence of the motionwhich continues some moments of time837 time after the return of the vibrating Body whereupon some space must be left to the subtil matter which upon the resilition of the Air starts as from a Center which action being the same by the Author supposed to be the cause of the Sound is repeated upon every vibration But finding it more difficult to shew how Tones are made by a Pipe where there are no visible vibrations he considers the Frame of a Pipe and the Motion of the Air in it and thereby attempts to find the Cause of the Tone of a Pipe and the pulse that gives the Sound not omitting to explicate how Tones are made in Violins Harpsecords and Dulcimers To this he subjoyns an ingenious Discourse of the Varying  Breaking of Tones endeavouring to explain how it is caused both in Strings and Pipes where occur divers pertinent Obser vations concerning the motion of Pendulums the Trumpet Ma rine  the True Trumpet as also the Sackbut And having shewd that Sound doth cause a motion not only of solid bodies but of the grosser parts of Air within the Sphere of it he considers that if the Air which is moved by being inclosed stands upon such a degree of resistance to Compression that it hath a Spring vibrating in the same measure with the Sound that puts it into motion there will be the same effect as when 2 Strings are tuned in Unison that is the motion will be so augmented by succeed ing regular pulses that the inclosed Air may be brought to ring and produce a Tone Where he taketh notice of the advice of Vitruvius in his Architecture importing that in the structure of a Theatre there should be vases or hollow pots of several sizes to answer all the Notes of Musick placed upon the Stage in such manner that the voice of them which sang upon the Stage might be augmented by the ringing of them Vitruvius mentioning di vers antient Theaters where such were in some of Brass in some of Earth After this he descends to the consideration of the Nature of Keys in Musick and of a single Tune which later he saith con sists in the succeeding Notes having a due relation to the preced ing and carrying their proper emphasis by length loudness and repetition with variety that may be agreable to the hearer Next he treats of Schismes and the Scale of Musick shewing that this Scale is not set out by any determinate quantities of whole or half Notes though the degrees are commonly so called but that the degrees in the Musical Scale are fixed by the Ear in these places where the pulses of the Tones are coincident with out838 out any regard to the quantity Here he endeavors to shew how all the Notes come into the Scale by their Relation and Digni ties whence he thinks it will be obvious why for easiness of in struction and convenience the Scale of Degrees of Musick is made as Musicians now exhibit it Having dispatched that work he proceeds to Musick that consists of several parts in Consort which is made up of Harmo ny Formality and Conformity Of which Harmony is the grateful sound produced by the joyning of several Tones in chord to one another Formality requires that the succeeding Notes be agreable to the former and Conformity will that each part have the like tendency to the succeeding Notes Lastly he speaks of Time or the measures of Musick the due observance of which is grateful for the same reason given for the Formality of a single Tune because the subsequent strokes are measured by the memory of the former and if they do compre hend them or are comprehended by them it is alike pleasant the mind cannot chuse but compare one with the other and ob serve when the strokes are coincident with the memory of the former Whence it is that the less the intervals are the more grateful is the measure because it is easily  exactly represent ed by the memory whereas a long space of time that cannot be comprehended in one thought is not retaind in the memory in its exact measure nor can abide the comparison the time past being always shortned by so much as it is removed from the time present The whole is concluded by two Observations by which we shall likewise conclude this Account 1 That it plainly appears by the Discourse of this Tract how Musick comes to be so copi ous for considering the species of keys the number of them the variety of Chords the allowable mixing of Discords the diver sity of measure it is not to be wondred at that it should like Language afford to every Age every Nation nay every Person particular stiles and modes 2 That it appears likewise that Tones or Modes of Musick in ancient time could not be of other kinds than are now since there can be no other in nature Where fore the great effects it then had if truly related must be imputed to the rarity of it and the barbarity of the people who are not transported with any thing after it become common to them March 29 Imprimatur 1677 B R O U N C K E R P R S London Printed for John Martyn Printer to the R Society 1677

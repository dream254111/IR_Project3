of a wealthy and poplllous possession of the crown and I feel justified in sayinffl in tllis stage of its occlpatiol that it will not fail to becorne sucll from aly natural disqualificatioll of the soilt    XEtpedition fo ascerfain the Fate of 7aptclin Ross From Materials comrnunicated to the Royal Geographical Society rRwO expeditions have been planlled durint the present season ill this coalutly ill uhich the ptilSUit of geographical sciellce is combined to great ad7antage with other more stirring incen tives tv action and for which accordingly the requisite funds will be furnished in mhole or in part by private 2eal Cne is a trading expedition up the Quorra consisting of two steamvessels and a brig well armedn and most liberally eqllipped which sailed last July under the conlmand of Mr MGregor Laird one of the enterprising Liverpool merchants who have engaged in tllis maglli ficent commercial speculation having also on board Mr Richarsl Lander as interpreter and guide and Lieutellant Allen RN as surveyor appoitxted to this service by the Admilalty and furnished with every lequisite instrunlent for making an exact sursrey of the river so far as his opportunities may permit The other is a land expectition destined to penetrate across the territories of the Hudsons Bay Company to the shore of the Arctic Sea primarily to ascer tair the fate of Captain Ross who it is rell known has not been heard of since he sailed in a stearnbout three rears ago with the Yiew of thus efTectillg a northwest passage to the Pacific and subordinate to this object to extend ollr knowledge of those shoresin particular to endeavour to fill up the interYal letween Cape Turnaain the eastern limit of Sir Johll Franklins disco velies axld the Straits of the Fury and Hecla where Sit Edward Parry was stopped by the ice when attempting to penetrate to the svestsvard along tllecca3t or should these prove as some ima gine merely the entrance of an inlet to determirle where eIse is situated the northeastern extremity of the American continent The hopes entertained by Captain Rosss friends that he and his companiolss are still alive and may be extricated om their critical position by eXorts yet made for their relief are founded partly on the eztent of his preparations which were calculated to meet his wallts for three yearspartly on the amoullt of stores which it is presumed he would find ulltouched ill the wreck of the Fury abandoned by Sir Edu7ard Parry in 1825and partly on the following account giverl by ERearne and quotesl by Mr Bar rw in his Chronological Elistory of Aretic Voyages pp t768Ezpedition in searsh of Ctuin Ross 337 of the fate of the crews of two Hudson Bay vessels vvho we3e cast 011 sl1ore on Marble Island in 1719 and of whom it was ascer tained afterwards that some survived nearly three years  111 the sunlmer of 1769 says Mr Hearne ltltrod p xxxi  while we were prosecuting the fishery we saw several Esqui maux at this new harbour alld perceivillg one or two of them greatly atlvanced in years vur curiosity was excited to ask them some questions concerning the above ship and sloop which we were the better etlabled to do by the assistance of an Esqalimallx who was tllen ill tile Coulpanys serYice as a linguist and annually sailed ill one of their vessels in that character The account uhich we received from them was full clear and unteserved and the sum of it was to the following purport  Wben the vessels arrived at this place Marble Island st was very late in the fall and in gettil1g them into the harbotlr the largest received much damage but on being failly il the El1glisls began to build the house their number at that time seemlng to be about fifty As soon as the ice permitted ill tle fol loing summerX 1720 the Esquimaux paid them another YiSit bv which time the llumber of the English was very greatlv reduced and those that were living seemed very unhealthy According to the accourlt given by the Esquimaux they were then very bsily employed but about uZhat they could not easily decribe proba bly in lengthening the lol1g boat for at a little distance fiom the house tllere was now lying a great quantity of oak chips hich had been made Inost assuredly by carpet1ters  A sicliness and famine occasioned such lla70ck among the El1glish that by the setting in of the second winter their nunaber was reduced to twenty lthat winter 172 some of the Esqui maus took up their abode ot1 the opposite side of the harboul to that on which the English had built their houses and frequently supplied thenl with such provisiolls as they had which clliefly consisted of whaleSs bll1bber seals flesh ald train oil XVl1en the spring advanced the Esquimaux went to the continent atld on their visiting Marble Islal1d agaill in the summer of 1721 they Ollly found five of the English alive and these urere ill sllch distress for provisions that they eagerly ate the seals fleh al1d whaleXs blubber quite raw as they purchased it from the natives This disordered them so 1luch that three of them died ill a few days and the other two tbough very seak made a shift to bury them These two sur7ived many days after the rest atld fre qllently went to the top of an adjacent rock alld easnestly looked to the south and east as if in expectation of some vessels comirlg to their relief After continlllng there a considerable time and nothing appearing in sight they sat down close togetber and wept bitterly At length one of the two died allalExpedttion tn search of Captain Ross 338 the other7s strength was so Xr exhaustedy that he fell down and died also in attempting b dig a grave for his companion The sclllls and other large bones of these two men ale ow lying above ground close to the house The longest liver was accolding to the Esquimans account iways enlployed in 7orking iron into implements for them  probably he was the armourer or smith If then it is argued severe as the suffenngs of these poor people were they could prolong their existence at all7 br nearly three years on Marble Island which is a bare glanit rock with sealeely any local resources whaterer is it not probable that Cap taill Rosss diicultiesJ even stlpposing that he was wrecked the first year of his departure nlay not yet have been overwhelm ing  If they could ffius survisea also with only a moderate stock of supplies in their shipst fitted QUt tS these necessurily were after the manner of the last centuly may not llis party be still iQlrnished amply in comparison  And even the chalater of the country seems to require

j100000,Science,1641980,The Irwin Expedition of Indiana University to Peru and Bolivia,i296554,THE IRWIN EXPEDITION OF INDIANA UNIVERSITY TO PERU AND BOLIVIA IN 1909 I summarized the knowledge of the distribution of South American freshwater fishes in general I dealt with the origin of the Pacific slope fish fauna in part in the fol lowingwords1 There are four distinct faunas on the Pacific slope of America between Cape Horn and the Tropic of Cancer One of these is of common origin with that on the Atlantic slope one is au tochthonus and the other two are derivative from the Atlantic slope faunas opposed to them 1 The fauna of southern Chili is essentially like that of Patagonia and inasmuch as it is largely made up of marine forms entering fresh water and freshwater forms entering the ocean it seems very probable that the species migrated from river to river along the coast from Patagonia to Chili or from Chili to Patagonia 2 At the other extreme in the Rio Mezquital of the Transition Region and the Yaqui just to the north of it there is a fauna essentially like that of the Rio Grande east of them As Meek has pointed out the Yaqui and Mezquital have cap tured tributaries of the Rio Grande togther with the fishes in them and the migration of Atlantic slope northern forms to the Pacific slope has been a passive one 34 Scientific Monthly May 1918 p 406 1 Reports of the Princeton University Expedi tions to Patagonia III 1909 p 352 Thus types which in America north of Mexico have not succeeded in reaching the Pacific slope have within the Tropics crossed the divide   3 The third fauna is the Mexican of the Rio de Santiago This is undoubtedly the relict of an old fauna reenforced by a few immigrants from the north It is here not a question of the origin of the fauna from an eastern one but of an au tochthonus development that has on its part con tributed elements to the surrounding rivers It passively contributed to the Atlantic slope fauna by having one of its small rivers captured by the Rio Panuco 4 Of more particular interest is the origin of the fauna of western Peru and Ecuador and that of western Central America Not enough is known of the fauna of the western part of Central America to attempt an explanation of its origin Concerning the Andean fauna I said in part page 305 The Andeair region includes the high Andes on both slopes from Venezuela and Colombia to Chili It is poor in species at any given point but some of the genera have a large number of local adaptations or species This region is distinctly marked off into three provinces 1 The Northern includes the highlands of north ern Peru Ecuador Colombia and Venezuela This is the richest in species and distinguished by the genera Arges Cyclopium Prenadilla and the high development of Chcetostomus Its fauna is largely an ancient derivative from the lowland fresh water fauna of Archiguiana 2 The Titieacan including the basin of Titicaca and neighboring streams and possibly the land locked basins of Bolivia concerning which nothing is known is distinguished by the genus Orestias and the absence of the genera distinguishing the northern province Its fauna is largely an ancient derivative from the ocean 3 The Southern is the poorest in species char acterized by the absence of everything but a few species of Pygidium a genus which extends the entire length of the Andean region Further p 373 I said The points of strategic importance for ichthyic chorology in South America are therefore west ern Colombia and Panama Guayaquil and Peru to the Amazon across the Andes    Most of my time since the publication of the monograph quoted in fact since its preparation several years earlier has been de 108 SCIENCEAbousT 2 1918 SCIENCE voted to working out the details of a plan then made I have had the cooperation of various institutions and individuals As part of this scheme I urged in SCIENCE N S Vol XXII No 549 pp 553556 the exploration of Panama before the canal should be completed This work was well done by the late S E Meek and S F Hildebrand under the auspices of the Field Museum and the Smithsonian Institution To examine conditions in Colombia I trav eled in 1913 from Cartagena up the Magda lena to Girardot thence to Bogota in the eastern Cordilleras thence across the Magda lena valley to Ibague across the central Andes to Cartago up the Cauca valley to Cali and across the western Andes to Buenaventura on the Pacific thence up the Pacific slope stream San Juan across the divide and down the At lantic slope rivers Quito and Atrato to the starting point My assistant during this trip Mr Manuel Gonzales later visited the At lantic slopes of the easternmost Andes between Bogota and Barrigona and Hermano Apoli nar Maria the efficient director of the Insti tuto de la Salle of Bogota had collections made for me in the Llanos east of Bogota Mr Hugh McK Landon and Mr Carl G Fisher later enabled Mr Arthur Henn now in medical service with the American Expedi tionary Forces and Mr Charles Wilson also now in medical service to explore the Patia and Atrato San Juan Basins of western Co lomnbia and still later Mr IHenn was enabled by Mr Landon and Indiana University to ex plore the western slope of Ecuador especially the Guayaquil basin Various attempts to secure the means to carry the work southward have failed until this spring when the American Association for the Advancement of Science made me an ap propriation of five hundred dollars the Indiana University made a similar appropriation and Mr William G Irwin of ColumbusIndiana sent the university a check to cover the larger part of the estimated expenses of the Peruvian part of the field work The University of Illinois is providing the expenses of an assist ant Mr William Ray Allen who is to devote his time largely to parasites and Miss Adele Rosa Eigenmann a medical student in Indi ana University is to go as a volunteer assist ant Submarines being willing we are to sail June 21 and the expedition is to be known as the Irwin Expedition As far as field work may be planned in ad vance it is the intention to cross from the Pa cific to the Amazon basin in at least three points in Peru First Pacasmayo over Cajamarca to Balzas on the Marafon The fishes of Pacasmayo are known in part at least through collections made by Osgood of the Field Museum Noth ing is known of the fauna of the Cajamarca valley and very little of that of the upper Marafion Second Callao over Oroyo Cerro de Pasco to Huanuco An attempt will be made to se cure the faunas of the Rimac of the High Andean Lake Hunin and of the head waters of the Huallaga Third Mollendo Arequipa Puno Cuzco and Rio Uiuabamba Attempts will be made to get as complete a representation as possible of the fauna of the Andean Lakes Titicaca and Poopo and of the Rio Urubamba of the Ucayale basin Fourth etc some work will be done in Bo livia and Chili but this will depend largely upon whether additional sums become avail able The expedition as definitely planned ought to give us as fair a notion of the Pacific slope fauna from the desert of northern Chili to Ecuador as we have of the Pacific slope of Ecuador Colombia and southern Panama as well as of the fauna immediately east of the crest of the Andes in Peru I am indebted to the president and trustees of Indiana University who have made it my duty to devote myself to the work as outlined for the time needed to complete it CARL H EIGENMANN SCIENTIFIC EVENTS

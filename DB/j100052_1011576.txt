j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1011576,Labor and Wages in France,i242596,LABOR AND WAGES IN FRANCE BY E LEVASSEUR Professor of Economic Geography History and Statistics in the College de France Paris Concerning labor and wages much has been written and more will be written because they have begun to assume great importance in social economy and contemporary politics As we cannot discuss all phases of them in an article of a few pages we shall treat the condition of labor in France with regard to three points only the organization of labor the rate of wages and the cost of living I In France as in other manufacturing countries great changes have taken place in the organization and condition of the laboring class particularly during the second half of the nineteenth century These changes are closely connected with a series of events which have fundamentally altered the economic condition of the world the sudden increase in the gold supply the progress of machine industry the development of railways particularly of international lines the transformation of navigation by the application of steam and the use of iron in shipbuilding the creation of a worldwide network of telegraph and cable lines the extension of colonial pos sessions and the opening of new countries to commerce To these causes must be added in France the establishment of universal suf frage in I848 which made labor questions the order of the day in politics under imperial as well as under republican government Indeed before I848 no law in favor of the working class had been put into effect excepting the law of March 22 1841 on child labor in industrial establishments which was hardly anywhere enforced During the second Republic from I848 to I85I there was a sudden outbreak of plans for social reform inspired by the socialist or philanthropic theories of the day and several laws were passed by the Constituent Assembly or by the Legislative Assembly concern ing boards of arbitration apprenticeship societies for mutual aid poor relief in Paris and oldage pensions The Second Empire did 407The Annals of the American Academy not forget that it owed its existence to popular vote and although exercising dictatorial power gave a more democratic turn to eco nomic legislation than the monarchy had done It developed mutual aid societies it abolished certain obsolete restrictions on trades of butchers and bakers in Paris it struck out of the civil code an article which made employer and employee unequal before the law The most important law of this kind was that of May 25 I864 which removed from the penal code the crime of combination although maintaining the penalities for violence committeed by strikers After the reestablishment of the Republic the theory of uni versal suffrage was generally accepted and since the election of M Grevy to the Presidency January 30 1879 the Republican party has been in power The government has inclined more and more to the Left since the ministry of WaldeckRousseau I899 radicalism has been dominant in Parliament and the influence of socialism has increased In consequence labor legislation has multiplied A law had been passed on May 19 I874 regulating the employment in industry of children and of women under age Under the Presidency of Grevy primary education had first been made free by law June I6 I88I and compulsory March 28 I882 Later came a third law October 30 I886 making education secular in the public schools and a very important law March 2I I884 legalized the existence of organizations of laborers and employers Under the Presidency of Carnot many important laws were enacted beginning with that of July 2 I890 which repealed the requirement of the workmans book The law of November 9 I892 besides reenforcing the system of protection for women and children in industry fixed their maximum labor day at ten hours The act of December 27 I892 provided for conciliation and voluntary arbi tration that of July 12 1893 dealt with the health and safety of factory workers that of July I5 I893 granted free medical aid that of June 29 I894 provided pensions for miners that of April I I898 regulated mutual aid societies that of April 9 I898 pro vided indemnity for industrial accidents The law of March 30 900oo made the length of the working day ten hours not only for women and children but also for men in trades where they work with women or children 408 184Labor and Wages in France Under the Presidency of M Loubet the law of July I I9OI assured general freedom of association although still submitting religious associations to some restrictions In I905 July I3 finan cial aid was provided for the destitute the aged and incurables Under the Presidency of M Fallieres legislation was passed July I3 I908 requiring the observance of a weekly restday Parliament has continued to discuss the proposed bill for pensioning workingmen which has been pending for more than fifteen years and upon which the two houses are far from being in agreement We cannot pass any general judgment upon these laws of which some afford needed protection as of children in industry while others hinder work and the increase of wealth Such legisla tion grows out of the system of economic intervention that is gov ernmental protection of wage earners especially industrial workers and administrative interference in the relations of employer and employee Intervention and liberalism are often directly opposed as regards economic questions intervention has won greater popular favor in France and consequently has become the dominant theory in Parliament today as is easily seen by the mass of labor legisla tion enacted during the ascendency of the Republican party II Combinations existed in France before I884 but they had no legal sanction The law of March 21 I884 gave them legal recog nition Article I Combinations or professional associations of persons practicing the same or allied occupations may be freely organized without governmental authorization Article II Pro fessional combinations have exclusively for their aim the study and defense of economic industrial commercial and agricultural inter ests Political and religious questions are forbidden them The three kinds of organizations employers associations trade unions and agricultural associations increased rapidly under this regime Mixed unions combining employers and employees alone had little success In I885 there were but 594 legally recognized unions in January I907 there were 1297I unions 3612 employers associations 5322 labor unions 154 mixed unions 3899 agricultural associations The growth of the movement had been not only con tinuous but progressive In point of membership the labor unions naturally have the lead On January I8 I907 they numbered 409 I85The Alnnals of the American Academy 896012 as against 316217 members of employers associations About 19 per cent of employers are organized and about 26 per cent of workingmen are members of unions There are trades in which this proportion is much higher as for example in mining where 65 per cent of the employers and 35 per cent of the miners are members of organizations Women up to the present time have taken a much less active part than men in this movement in 1907 there were only 79260 women in trade unions and 6429 in mixed unions The 3883 agricultural associations numbered 716530 members in I907 Although largely comprised of land owners and cultiva tors most of the associations admit farm laborers or at least metayers sharerenters There are also federations of unions authorized by the law of I884 There were in January I907 308 federations I Io employers I87 laborers and II mixed comprising 6173 unions and I01I975 members1 The unionists especially those of the labor party were not entirely satisfied with the law of I884 They claim more extended privileges they protest against Articles 414 and 415 of the Penal Code relating to strikes which punish violence committed during strikes Whatever its purpose the law of I884 has produced im portant results as statistics show VVWithout doubt for a long time to come the membership of unions will increase because the prin ciple of association continues to become more and more a matter of course being for labor a road to power and for capital a wall of defense Are the results good or bad They are both One might say they were generally good had not the union so often departed from the course which the lawmaker has laid out for it This organiza tion of labor is new by means of it the laboring class as a whole has already gained and will continue to gain power with which to make good its claims The leaders and enthusiastic supporters of unions have found here a financial and social situation which in creases their own importance Time and again the organized work 1 An article from the American Federationist November 1908 attributes to labor unions 3000000 members in the United States 2500000 in England and Germany and 1500000 in France French statistics for January 1 1907 show 896012 members of trade unions and 316217 members of employers associations 410 I86Labor and Wages in France ers have been led as a body to adopt policies which they do not individually desire and which they know are not to their interest The employers had formed associations under different names before the law of I884 and they have perhaps gained nothing from the new system Their adoption of it has been due less to the recognized advantages of association than to fear of the labor unions The idea of association seems to imply that of union However it is evident that outside of agriculture the mixed unions in which wage earners and wage payers ought to be able to forward their mutual interests have had but little success Those which have prospered are the associations grouping workers and employers in two hostile armies opposed one to ithe other and organized perma nently on a war footing The group of workers is always disposed to encroach on the authority of the employers to claim more and more advantages and to declare war in order to secure those advan tages The employers striving to maintain the statu quo answer with the lockout demands which they consider unjustifiable Such a state of things is favorable neither to the increase of wealth nor to social harmony Nevertheless it must be tolerated for the time being and it is not too much to hope that greater intelligence and stability in France will come with experience The great trade unions of England have today a more rational program and a greater influence in the political and industrial world than they had threequarters of a century ago Contest is not however the sole object of organization Work ingmen have two ways of interpreting and practicing unionism One is that the union should occupy itself exclusively with the imme diate business of the trade striving to keep wages from falling and finding ways of increasing them discussing questions relating to the personnel of the factory and shop rules and creating and main taining institutions useful to the members of the unions such as employment bureaus mutual aid societies traveling benefits out ofwork benefits and trade instruction These forms of activity are in accord with the provisions of the law of I884 The other interpretation allows the union not only to occupy itself with strictly trade affairs but also to work by systematic agita tion for the breakdown of the existing social order and thus to prepare for a new order of things in which the wage earner and 4II I87The Annals of the American Academy the employer will no longer exist as such but will be replaced by a universal association of workers This introduces into the trade union the very political element forbidden by the law of I884 The socalled yellow unions belong to the first class to the second many of the red and especially the revolutionary unions Labor exchanges are the centers of union action They were created not by general law but by municipal authorization The first was that of Paris opened in I887 The placing of workingmen is and should be one of their principal functions yet the I31 ex changes in France secured in I906 only 62000 positions for work ers They are in general under the influence of the red unions and as in the case of the federations it too often happens that although created for the service of the wage earning class they tend to be come hotbeds of revolutionary doctrine There are numerous federations having a sense of their eco nomic rights and duties like the General Book Federation There are others that are filled with revolutionary sentiment and hatred of the existing order The red unions in general are imbued with socialistic theories especially of the collectivist or communist type or with the doctrine of anarchy Considering the directors of industry robbers who through profit are appropriating unjustly part of the product of labor they always oppose them as enemies They fight not only for increased wages and shorter hours which is legitimate but they favor a reduction of the output of Jlabor during these hours They believe that by doing less and leaving more to be done they compel the employer to pay them for more time and to employ those who are out of work It is not only in France that such ideas prevail They advise workmen dissatisfied with their employers to repay themselves by sabotage that is by wasting raw materials spoiling work and sending out imperfect products an act which is in reality very much like theft The General Federation of Labor is today the most powerful union in France which professes and practices this doctrine Although holding only socialistic theories it refuses to join the Socialist party in parliament which it accuses of being a bourgeois phrasemaking party The Federation claims to represent only the labor party pure and simple Its watchword is direct action that is establishment of its standards by strike and insurrection against the existing industrial organization 412 I88Labor and Wages in France Unionism says the General Labor Federation forces the laboring class into line of battle Unionism implies that the work ing class is the only one that can renew the world and this only if it keeps free from bourgeois domination Laborers are robbed by employers who control the armed force of society but the robbed who have right already on their side need only unite in order to have might also By employing the general strike they can strangle capitalism and substitute voluntary control by producers for capital istic control It is in order to wrest power from the employing class that the Federation preaches the doctrine of antimilitarism and antipatriotism Such a doctrine put into practice by direct action is a constant menace to society The question of suppressing the Federation of Labor for violating the provisions of the law of I884 relative to political action has been recently agitated by the press III The declaration and the management of strikes is one of the chief objects of union action There were indeed strikes in France before the laws of May 25 I864 and March I9 I884 but they have increased in number as a consequence of these laws the first of which made combination legal and the second of which gave the strike a legal status From I87I to I884 the number of recognized strikes varied in different years from 2I in I874 to I82 in I882 From I893 on the statistics of strikes are almost complete In I894 39I strikes were recorded with 54576 strikers in I906 1309 strikes with 432366 strikers This is the maximum The increase is considerable but it has not been regularly progressive Ordinarily strikes increase in years of great industrial activity when the demand for labor exceeds the supply as in I896 on the contrary they diminish in dull years when many laborers find difficulty in getting work and when the unions understand that there is no use in asking for increased wages More than a third of all strikes have been due to demands for higher wages Next among causes of strikes come the reduc tion of working hours the method and regulation of wage payment the dimissal of workingmen and of foremen From I900 to I906 the general outcome of strikes was as follows 23 per cent succeeded 397 per cent were compromised 413 I89The Annals of the American Academy 372 per cent failed As the labor unions are better organized since the law of I884 arbitration appears to have become more common than formerly but it is questionable whether strikes have actually contributed to a general rise of wagerates However important strikes may be they involve only a very small fraction of the working class From I890 to I899 there were on the average only 87ooo workmen engaged in strikes out of 5500000 industrial workers that is a little more than one and a half per cent There are two general classes of strikes The purely trade strikes are conflicts between workingmen and one or more employers in the same industry which have a definite object and which usually come to an end without attracting public attention These are much the more numerous Revolutionary strikes which aim to arouse society and to prepare by forcible upheaval for the coming of an ideal state are on the contrary usually disorderly They often cause acts of violence that necessitate military repression The general strike would be an exceedingly revolutionary movement and in fomenting it the General Federation of Labor is a constant menace to society But there has never been such an uprising and it would seem an impossibility to produce a simultaneous strike of all wageearners IV The next question is what have been the changes in nominal wages since the beginning of the nineteenth century that is what have been the variations in the sum of money which the workman receives as the price of a days labor The four decennial Reports on Agriculture give as the average wages of farm hands in sum mer 142 francs in I850 277 in I862 3II in I882 294 in 1892 Thus wages more than doubled from I850 to I882 decreasing slightly in I892 a year of general low prices The statistics of wages in industry although insufficient for the calculation of an exact average are more numerous and more varied than those of agricul tural wages The following table gives an index number of wages in the building trades of Paris from the beginning of the nineteenth century 414 I90Labor and Wages in France Year Number I806  ioo I852  1483 1862   1878 I9I Yea r Index Year Number I873  1933 i88o0   2520 1900oo   271I Masons in Paris for example earned 390 francs for twelve hours work in I806 they earned 8oo francs in ten hours from I900 to 1905 In the coal mining industry from which the govern ment engineers have gathered annual statistics the average daily wage was found to be 209 francs in 1884 325 francs in 1872 453 francs in 1905 Statistics of wages in the minor industries in the chief towns of the various departments collected by order of the Minister of Commerce give the following average for the two extremes of the series In I853 382 francs in Paris and 201 francs in the other cities in I887 534 francs and 3I7 francs that is an increase of 57 per cent in Paris and of 66 per cent in the provinces A recent investigation has given as the averages 637 francs in 1896 and 693 francs in I9OI in Paris 385 francs and 392 francs in the prov inces From I853 to 1901 the increase amounts to 8i per cent for Paris and to 92 per cent for the provinces The Bureau of Labor regularly receives from the mayors and boards of arbitration information which gives these results First the scale of average wages in the chief towns of the provinces not including Paris was as follows In 1853 199 francs in I874 302 francs in 1906 420 francs Second the index numbers of wages run thus ear Index3 Y Index Year Number Year 8o6  465 86o  645 I8IO  47 1870  76 1820  485 i88o  925 1830  50 1890  98 I840  52 1900 ioo00 i850  565 1905  I04 These different scales must be considered as mere approx imations since they are the result not of complete statistics but of 2 Calculated on 1806 as a basis 3 Calculated on 1900 as a basis 415The Annals of the American Academy partial information nevertheless they are as nearly accurate as pos sible They show First a general increase in wages from one decade to another second a slow increase up to I850 third a rapid increase from I850 to I88o fourth a slower increase since I880 synchronous with a general fall in wholesale prices fifth a retardation of the increase since I896 this is scarcely perceptible on the last scale to 1905 and more perhaps in I9o6 and I907 To sum up the nominal average wage has more than doubled since the beginning of the nineteenth century These averages and these index numbers are composed of very diverse elements For example in a certain city in I9OI the aver age wage for day laborers was about 29I francs and that for carpenters about 520 francs the differences being due to the differences of occupation At Auch a city with little industry the general average is about 252 francs while it is about 579 francs at Versailles and about 750 francs in the department of the Seine the difference being due to locality A report of the Bureau of Labor on the furniture trades shows an average wage of 343 francs for young workers from I2 to 17 years of age 71I9 francs for workmen from 25 to 44 years 593 francs for those over 64 the differences being due to differences in age In the steel indus try in Longwy in I905 the head firemen earned 850 francs to 930 francs a day and the unskilled workers 350 to 395 francs differing according to the different tasks in the same trade In general the wages of women do not amount to more than half or twothirds of those of men the difference being due to sex It is worth noting that the wages of domestic servants who seldom form unions and who do not unite in order to strike have increased at least as much as the wages of workingmen and prob ably even more The causes of this increase are known Fromthis fact we may draw the conclusion that unionism deludes itself when it claims that it is the principal cause of the increase in the rate of wages The nominal wage increased greatly during the second half of the nineteenth century This is an undisputable fact although it is impossible to give a precise general measure of such increase and although it differs widely according to place trade and individual Is the real wage also greater that is can the workingman with his increased money wage buy more than formerly of the consump 416 I92Labor and Wages in France tion goods ordinarily used by a workingmans family The second problem is much more complex than the first and it is not possible to do more than to give an approximate solution The problem may be simplified by considering a limited number of articles of consumption The first fact to be noted is that the price of bread an important article of food in the French working mans family has fallen rather than risen within the last forty years The second notable fact is that the price of food in general like that of many other articles of merchandise was on the increase from I850 to I873I880 then fell until about I896 and from that year until I907 rose again Since it is impossible in this brief paper to multiply proofs of this fact as is done in my volume entitled Questions ouvrieres et industrielles en France sous la troisieme Republique and in that entitled de Salariat et Salaires we will confine ourselves to a few illustrations First is the example of the Lycee of Louis leGrand the accounts of the expenditures of which are reliable and accurate We find there stated the price per unit of each commodity bought since I840 and we have added up the totals for each year The total is I663 francs in I847 before the rise in prices I862 francs in I873 following the almost constant annual rise in prices I651 francs in I905 following a series of years of falling prices then a rise which brought the total to I836 francs in I9o64 These give it is true practically wholesale prices but retail prices follow whole sale although somewhat irregularly Another proof is found in the work of the statistician Bienayme who very conscientiously studied the problem of prices in Paris computing the cost of living food by a tabulation of figures first from I830 to I850 the index numbers fall from I24 to 96 second from 1855 to I88o they rise from 124 to I56 thirdly from I88o to I896 they fall to I20 From I896 to I900 a period which M Bienayme has not included in his researches the index numbers have quite perceptibly risen Likewise the unit price of 88 kinds of groceries in common use fell from III79 francs in I88I to 8254 francs and rose again to io605 francs in I908 A third proof is found in the extensive statistics collected by 41768 francs in 1908 4I7 I93The Annals of the American Academy the Bureau of Labor in the United States within the past ten years which show an increase in the same way of retail prices of food After food which absorbs from 40 to 6o per cent of his family income sometimes even more in cases of low wages and a large family the next important item of the workingmans budget is rent including light and heat Rent has greatly increased in Paris and in large centers generally It has not increased in small towns whose population has remained stationary or has diminished The Bureau of Labor has extended this inquiry further it has tried to estimate the cost of food rent heat and light taken alto gether on the hypothesis that their quality and quantity have not varied If this cost for I900 is represented by ioo00 the correspond ing figure for I906 is 77 for 1850 865 and for I88o 107 The cost evidently rose up to I88o and then up to I900 fell The Bureau of Labor has made the following table of com parisons Index Number Index Number Year of Nominal Wages Year of Cost of Living5 I853 100o 844I853  I00 I874   150 1864I873  31I i892  84 I884I893  127 Without claiming for these estimates mathematical precision we may conclude that since I874 not only has the nominal wage increased rapidly but the real wage or purchasing power has increased even more These data are not sufficient really to solve the problem for the saying has long been as true of the workingmans as of the bourgeois family Living grows dearer Certainly one cannot live today on the same income as sixty years ago This is due not only to the pos sible fall in the commercial value of money that is to say its pur chasing power but also to a certain lessening in the social value of money that is to say more money is needed to maintain the standard of living of any given social group Wants multiply as the progress of industry increases the material means of satisfying them and as increased income makes more complete satisfaction financi ally possible For example the food of the workingman in town and country has greatly improved and consequently costs more b For a fixed amount of food shelter heat and light 418 194Labor and Wages in France Illustrations of this may be found in Questions ouvrieres et indus trielles en France sous la troisieme Republique The workingman in Sunday clothes might be taken for a bourgeois it was quite otherwise in France seventyfive years ago Traveling by rail is less expensive now than traveling by carriage formerly Yet the workingmans traveling expenses are much higher than formerly because then they went on foot and moved about much less frequently than now They read little and did not have their pictures taken today they all buy newspapers and have photo graphs and there are a hundred other occasions for expenditure One observes these changes in domestic economy in comparing the average per capita consumption of different periods The higher standard of living must be paid for in all classes of society this is the chief reason for the increased cost of living A family at first appreciates the increase in well being Soon however it becomes accustomed to the improvement and its feeling of satisfaction wanes People are thoughtless in this respect what they feel most keenly is the diminution of well being when it accidentally occurs Workingmen have more comfort but probably no more satisfaction in it because instead of glancing back upon the condition of their grandfathers they keep their eyes fixed on the large incomes of their employers and they are discontented with an inequality for the economic cause of which they seek no explanation Hence arises a social unrest which tends to intensify itself and which is one reason for the success of the socialist propaganda In summing up we may deduce the following fourfold con clusion respecting the condition of the French workingman First an increase in nominal wages during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries of varying proportions in various periods Second a lowering or maintaining of the cost of ordinary articles of consumption not luxuries according to whether the prices temporarily are low or high Third an increase in real wages Fourth an increase in the cost of living due to more abundant more refined and more varied consumption 419 I95

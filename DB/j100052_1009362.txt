j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1009362,Notes,i242533,BOOK DEPARTMENT NOTES IN MAGNA CHARTA  the author has sought as he tells us to make a short book of interest to the general reader  avoiding or ex plaining technical terms not understood by the lay mind Part I is an historical sketch elementary in character of the reigns of the Norman kings in which is set forth the abuses that culminated in the demand for the great statute Part II contains the charters granted by the early kings from Henry I to Edward I the laws of Edward the Confessor and the Sentences of the Bishops and of the Clergy In Part III the author gives explanatory notes on the Charter of King John and the Forest Charter of Henry III It is to be regretted that Part III contains no citation of authorities the general reader and it is for the general reader that the book is written may verify the statements in Palt I by reference to any Eng lish history but those chapters of the charter which require explana tion require it in most cases because they deal with legal institutions which have long been dead or have grown past recognition since the day John swore by Gods teeth  at Runnymede he would never estab lish or confirm them Verification of the authors explanation of these can be found only in legal works and to such works the general reader needs special direction he is entitled to know for example on whom the author relies for the statement that Chapter 39 of the charter relates to the jury system when the most accurate modern authorities Forsyth Pollock Maitland and others agree that it has no reference to this institution Mr BOWLEYS WAGES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM IN THR NINETEENTH CENTURY presents an admirable application of the statistical method to the very kernel of the labor problem It is valuable not only for the light it throws on changes in wages in different trades during the centuryjust drawing to a close but also for its keen analysis of tlle difficulties connected with wage statistics and the ingenious methods suggested for coping with these difficulties The chief subjects treated in the book are thus described in the

information with mention of some special difficulties in making general estimates a general statistical history of the wages in groups of industries such as agriculture the building trades mining textiles and mechanical engineering industries the distinction between wages and earnings the difficulties of conducting a wage census and former attempts to do so and the special features of modern estimates the more minute investigation of the wage statistics of the building trades illustrating the special difficulties which arise and the methods of calculation applicable the treatment of the statistics of a new and expanding trade and of a decaying trade the combination of these figures with the general average and the difficulties in the way of a general comparison and the reduction of all wage statistics to yearly averages referring to the whole sphere of industry Each one of these topics is treated with great clearness and abundant material is presented to substantiate the authors conclusions He bases these on calculations of rates of change in the wages paid for labor of dif ferent grades rather than on comparisons of the average wages paid in different trades at different periods and is thus enabled to utilize a great deal of material too fragmentary to be otherwise employed As a result of his investigation he concludes that if the rates paid in the United Kingdom from I89o99 when they were fairly constant be represented by Ioo the rates from I8809o should be put at go those from 187080 at 95 from I86070 at 75 from i85060 at 65 from I84050 at 60 from I83o40 at 60 etc and that during the one hundred and twenty years from 1780 to i899 the rates increased from 40 to 1oo The work concludes with a full bibliography and a careful index IN THB NEw DEMOCRACY1 the author a professor in the Uni versity of Tasmania has given us valuable information on the practi cal working of the Hare system of voting which has been in force in Tasmania since 1896 and of the new Australian constitution Had he confined his book to such local topics it would have been an unquali fied success Or he might even have added the chapter in which he urges the teaching of history as a means of increasing the intelligence and political knowledge of the voters But the rest of the book is of no value to the ordinary student of politics save as a clear and well arranged statement of old ideas It is taken almost exclusively from 1 The New Democracy By JETHRO BROWN M A LLD Pp xii 2x5 Price 2oo New York The Macmillan Company I899 442NcOrs I31 Mill Bryce Lecky Bodley and Godkin The more original parts of the work are lacking in accuracy Thus he regards the condition of parties in France as peculiar to that country p 25 he thinks that Bryan received little popular support p 9I and he says p 172 that  the state in its origin was an organized body of men occupying a definite territory  MR E H BYINGTON has supplemented his former work on  The Puritan in England and New England  by a study of  The Puritan as a Colonist and Reformer 2 In the latter work the author devotes the first three chapters to a discussion of the early beginnings of the colonies including some mention of their economic conditions the relations with the Indians the church and the government This part of the book concludes with the usual exaggerated estimate of the influence of New England on American institutions The Greater New England stretches from ocean to ocean In the next two chapters the author discusses the religious side of the early Puri tans their influence upon the Indians and more especially the work of John Eliot and Jonathan Edwards The work concludes with a brief consideration of Shakespeares attitude toward the Puritans the author believes that Shakespeare and the Puritans misunderstood each other that the latter seemed to the poet narrow and bigoted while they in their turn could recognize only the supreme importance of spiritual things The Puritans also wished to establish the rights of the middle classes whereas Shakespeare and many others of his class were not interested in this movement and therefore perhaps ignored its true importance A

explanatory portions of the text which suffer from the nar row basis on which the discussion rests The trade between any two countries cannot be understood unless trade relations with other countries are taken into account Nor can foreign trade as a whole be comprehended if studied apart from other aspects of a nations industrial life These obvious facts are ignored by the author who seems to have lacked the necessary preparation for a really comprehensive treatment of the trade between the United States and the United Kingdom His use of the best authorities Giffen for facts in regard to English trade and Wells and Taussig for information touching the trade of the United States saves him from committing very serious blunders but when he departs from the paths marked out by these writers and suggests original explanations his incomplete grasp of the subject becomes conspicuous Notwith standing the essential facts are clearly presented and for the most part speak for themselves  THE SOCIAL PHASES OF EDUCATION  marks its author the Su perintendent of the Public Schools of Brookline Massachusetts as a teacher who has carried the theory of the new education to its logical conclusions Not content with making the school an instrumentality for the full and free development of the individual the author asks to what end is education new or old rational or mechanical if not for the development of fine moral character In social service he finds the goal towards which education should be directed  From each according to his ability To each according to his needs Habit and mental attitude are all important The interdependence of all parts of human society requires altruism Not how much but what kind of education is the test Is it leading to the fullest meas ure of social service  Mr Dutton reconciles the socalled conflicting aims  preparation for vocation and general culture The value of all subjects is gauged by their utility Vocational studies have in them the germs of mental moral and aesthetic culture The home and the school must be social in character and aim Froebel and Herbart have set the right standards No sane person now thinks of treating

the future is to take its point of direction more from sociology than from psychology is the governing principle Three aims should dominate educationthe knowledge of ones social environment the sense of individual freedom and responsibility and a consciousness of relationship to human iustitutions Let education restore industrial cooperation let it apply scientific ideas develop manual and industrial arts and emphasize the dignity of vocation and it will cease to be unrelated to the life of the individual and the nation The church must recognize the unity of all Christian works The school is the chief moral and civic force at its command Inductive thought and the democratic spirit are at once the cause and effect of education The correlation of educational forces in the community is based on the truth that  there is not one single element of civili zation that is not made to depend in the end upon public opinion The Brookline Education Society is an example of the possible enlistment of large and varied lay forces in educational progress The interest and confidence of the people must be won so that they believe in the value of what is done else much of the labor goes for nothing UNDER THE TITL  DEMOCRACY AND EMPIRE 2 Professor Giddings has arranged several of his recent addresses and arti cles with the object of giving them a continuous sequence In the opening essay The Democratic Empire the author states his position clearly and forcibly it is that democracy and empire are entirely harmonious under the dominion of the AngloSaxons Great Britain and the United States have steadily extended their rule in the last century and just as steadily have they become more democratic This process may be continued in the future says the author all on the one inviolable condition that as it lengthens the reach of government it must curtail the functions of government The various local governments may undertake what they please but the national or imperial government must be content to lose in intensity what it gains in extent  It must confine itself practically to three things namely the imperial defence the suppression of conflict between one part of the empire and another and insistence that local administration shall come up to a certain standard in its protection of life and property and in its respect for enlightenment 1 Contributed by Miss Dora Keen Philadelphia 2Democracy of Empire By FRANKLIN HENRY GIDDINGS Ph D Pp 363 New York The Macmillan Company x9oo 445134 ANNALS OF THE ANMERICAN ACADEMY In the last article on The Gospel of NonResistance Professor Giddings tries to show that through the spread of the democratic empire the principle of like mindedness of homogeneity in fundamen tal things will be so far applied that men may differ on minor subjects but in the essential things will lose the predatory aggres sive habit and the habit of resistance By agreeing with each other in the fundamental principles of civil organization individual liberty standards of conduct and loyalty to a common destiny the people will realize the gospel of nonresistance although abundant room will be left for individual differences and progressive elements along other lines Professor Giddings declares in his preface that the eighteen chapters intervening between these two thoughts are natural connect ing links Among these are articles on the  Ethical Motive Mind of the Many Industrial Demiocracy Trusts and the Pub lic Railroads and the State  Some Results of the Freedom of Women etc The average reader will hardly agree with the author as to the intimate connection between these subjects and the title of the book nor as to the relation of the various articles to each other The book is not a book but a collection of essays Some of the essays treat of democracy some of imperialism and some of democ racy and imperialism and many of other subjects All are interesting all are characterized by that forceful logic which is so familiar in Professor Giddings work but they are separate articles rather than connected chapters MR THEODORE GItLMAN a New York banker who published two years ago A Graded Banking System in which he advocated a plan for the issue of bank note currency regulated by incorporated clearing houses reenforces his argument by the publication of a second book entitled  Federal Clearing Houses The new book contains a state ment of Mr Gilmans plan and several articles which he has pub lished in magazines and newspapers during the last two years It also reproduces Mr Goschens speech on English Bank Reserves delivered at Leeds in I891 Mr Gilman makes very clear the neces sity for a bank circulation which shall vary with the needs of business justly holding that it will either prevent panics or greatly mitigate their evils He discusses with much acumen and clearness the sub jects of panics elasticity of the currency and the services which bank notes perform for the business

details is the simplest and most rational which has thus far been sug gested It could be adopted without any radical changes in our bank ing system and the bank notes for which it makes provision while not secured by deposit of bonds or legal tender money would be the crystallized credit of the entire country certain of redemption and available at a time when other forms of credit through apprehension or actual panic fall into disuse THE ACTIVITY OF French publishers in making available for French readers the best foreign literature on economic and social questions has frequently been remarked upon in these columns Among the series contributing to the ever swelling stream of this literature is the Bibliothkque Internationale des Sciences Sociologiques published under the direction of Professor Hamon of the new University of Brussels The fourth volume of this series which has recently appeared consists of a scholarly translation of Karl Marxs Zur Kritik der politischen Oekonomie2 which was first published by the author in 1859 and was in the nature of an introduction to his larger treatise on Capital Subsequent volumes to appear in the same series are translations of Lassalles Reden an die deutschen Arbeiter Bern steins  Life of Lassalle  and a collection of the socialistic writings of William Morris  PREHISTORIC SCOTLAND  3 is a study of the earliest

AMERICAN ACADEMY THE CosT OF LIVING  represents a departure from former methods of teaching hygiene The teaching of hygiene as a natural science has not accomplished what was prophesied for it two decades since The sanitarian is beginning now to treat hygiene as one phase of a social science To that end the author of the book under discussion presents nine lectures on domestic economy Start ing with the assumption that half of our income is wasted or in other words that present incomes go only half as far as they might the author concludes that reform may be effected through improve ment in consumption as well as through an increased share in the results of production In fact permanent improvements in the stan dard of life depend rather upon wise spending than upon large earn ings Sanitary science furnishes the criterion of wise expenditure in the selection of a diet of a building site and household furnishings The lectures go further and suggest model budgets for the households dependent upon modest incomes Many economies are discussed whereby the small incomes may be made to raise materially the stan dard of life without subtracting any real or supposed essentials in the existing standard TAXATION OP LAND VALUE S AND THE SINGLE TAX X is the title of a collection of papers by Professor Smart discussing the pro posal to impose a tax on land owners in Glasgow adjusted to the site value Though not professing to be a contribution to economic science the essay throws an interesting side light on the claim so often advanced that municipal ownership will lessen the burden of taxation The experience of Glasgow seems to indi cate that the enlargement of public services necessitates larger rather than smaller revenues from taxation The more the city gives the more its citizens want In Professor Smarts opinion taxing site owners instead of increasing the rates paid by occupiers involves double taxation confiscation and violation of contracts and can only terminate in pure Henry Georgeism How unde sirable he deems this outcome is explained in a final chapter on The Single Tax His exposition and criticism of the Glasgow bill is clear and forcible and must have carried considerable weight when first published in the Glasgow Herald in the summer of 1899 1 The Cost of Living as Modified by Sanitary Science By LLEN H RICHARDS Pp 12I Price

are exhaustive for the six years covered Following the author catalogue is a full subject index which will be found particularly useful to the student entering the mazes of this literature for the first time As a whole the work is a monument to the patience and accu racy of its justly celebrated author HENRY W THURSTON head of the department of social and economic science of the Chicago Normal School has brought out a manual on Economics and Industrial History for Secondary Schools2 containing many novel and valuable features The under lying thought of the book is that elementary instruction in econo mics ought to concern itself primarily with economic phenomena falling within the pupils own range of experience and that he should be taught to observe and collate the facts of his own environ ment and thus arrive at some of the more general principles of the science Following out this notion the author has divided his work into three parts I Industrial Observation and Interpreta tion II Outlines of the Industrial History of England and the United States III Elements of Economic Theory In using the first part the teacher is recommended in the accompanying Teachers Manual to require the students to make their own obser vations which are to be presented in regular reports and to do their own interpreting under the stimulus of suggestive questions This is the most valuable part of the book and will be welcomed even by teachers who prefer to present the subject in a somewhat different way It rests on sound pedagogical principles and indi cates how economics may be imparted to secondary school pupils free from the dogmatism which usually characterizes such instruc tion The second and third parts are less original but show the same clear grasp of the principle that the concrete should precede 1 Pp iv 404 Price 13 mark Jena Gustav Fisher I9oo sPp 300 Teachers JManual Price xoo Chicago Scott Foresman  Co I899 449 NOTES 137ANNALS OF THZ AMERICAN ACADEMY and

ClaytonBulwer Treaty 1 gives a full and accurate account of the causes leading up to and the con ditions attending the negotiations of this much mooted instrument This is followed by an equally detailed history of the controversies to which the convention has since given rise On the whole the authors conclusions are favorable to the treaty in the first place because in his opinion it kept Great Britain and the United States from going to war over the matter of the control of the isthmus and secondly because it provides in the best possible way for the neutralization of the interoceanic canal Now that England and the United States have at last learned to understand each other and finally come to comprehend the reciprocal provisions of the contract Dr Travis thinks they should retain the ClaytonBulwer Treaty and live up to its terms The authors attitude is rather that of the accurate historian than that of the political philosopher and on this account immediate rather than ultimate causes and consequences are emphasized in the argument REVIEWS Growth of Nationality in the United States A Social Study By JOHN BASCOM Pp ix 213 Price I25 New York G P Put nams Sons I899 The title of the book is somewhat misleading it is not strictly a study of the forces which have brought about nationality but rather a study of the obstacles which these forces had to overcome The author considers not so much  the growth of national life under the consti tution as  the divisions which were incident to the conditions under which the constitution was formed    or which grew up later under its operation  p 7 These divisionsobstacles to the growth of nationality rather than forces which produced itwere of four sorts r Strife between states and the general government 2 strife

SENTENCES OF THE BISHOPS AND OF THE CLERGY IN PART III THE AUTHOR GIVES EXPLANATORY NOTES ON THE CHARTER OF KING JOHN AND THE FOREST CHARTER OF HENRY III IT IS TO BE REGRETTED THAT PART III CONTAINS NO CITATION OF AUTHORITIES THE GENERAL READER AND IT IS FOR THE GENERAL READER THAT THE BOOK IS WRITTEN MAY VERIFY THE STATEMENTS IN PALT I BY REFERENCE TO ANY ENG LISH HISTORY BUT THOSE CHAPTERS OF THE CHARTER WHICH REQUIRE EXPLANA TION REQUIRE IT IN MOST CASES BECAUSE THEY DEAL WITH LEGAL INSTITUTIONS WHICH HAVE LONG BEEN DEAD OR HAVE GROWN PAST RECOGNITION SINCE THE DAY JOHN SWORE BY GODS TEETH  AT RUNNYMEDE HE WOULD NEVER ESTAB LISH OR CONFIRM THEM VERIFICATION OF THE AUTHORS EXPLANATION OF THESE CAN BE FOUND ONLY IN LEGAL WORKS AND TO SUCH WORKS THE GENERAL READER NEEDS SPECIAL DIRECTION HE IS ENTITLED TO KNOW FOR EXAMPLE ON WHOM THE AUTHOR RELIES FOR THE STATEMENT THAT CHAPTER 39 OF THE CHARTER RELATES TO THE JURY SYSTEM WHEN THE MOST ACCURATE MODERN AUTHORITIES FORSYTH POLLOCK MAITLAND AND OTHERS AGREE THAT IT HAS NO REFERENCE TO THIS INSTITUTION MR BOWLEYS WAGES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM IN THR NINETEENTH CENTURY PRESENTS AN ADMIRABLE APPLICATION OF THE STATISTICAL

INFORMATION WITH MENTION OF SOME SPECIAL DIFFICULTIES IN MAKING GENERAL ESTIMATES A GENERAL STATISTICAL HISTORY OF THE WAGES IN GROUPS OF INDUSTRIES SUCH AS AGRICULTURE THE BUILDING TRADES MINING TEXTILES AND MECHANICAL ENGINEERING INDUSTRIES THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN WAGES AND EARNINGS THE DIFFICULTIES OF CONDUCTING A WAGE CENSUS AND FORMER ATTEMPTS TO DO SO AND THE SPECIAL FEATURES OF MODERN ESTIMATES THE MORE MINUTE INVESTIGATION OF THE WAGE STATISTICS OF THE BUILDING TRADES ILLUSTRATING THE SPECIAL DIFFICULTIES WHICH ARISE AND THE METHODS OF CALCULATION APPLICABLE THE TREATMENT OF THE STATISTICS OF A NEW AND EXPANDING TRADE AND OF A DECAYING TRADE THE COMBINATION OF THESE FIGURES WITH THE GENERAL AVERAGE AND THE DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY OF A GENERAL COMPARISON AND THE REDUCTION OF ALL WAGE STATISTICS TO YEARLY AVERAGES REFERRING TO THE WHOLE SPHERE OF INDUSTRY EACH ONE OF THESE TOPICS IS TREATED WITH GREAT CLEARNESS AND ABUNDANT MATERIAL IS PRESENTED TO SUBSTANTIATE THE AUTHORS CONCLUSIONS HE BASES THESE ON CALCULATIONS OF RATES OF CHANGE IN THE WAGES PAID FOR LABOR OF DIF FERENT GRADES RATHER THAN ON COMPARISONS OF THE AVERAGE WAGES PAID IN DIFFERENT TRADES AT DIFFERENT PERIODS AND IS THUS ENABLED TO UTILIZE A GREAT DEAL OF MATERIAL TOO FRAGMENTARY TO BE OTHERWISE EMPLOYED AS A RESULT OF HIS INVESTIGATION HE CONCLUDES THAT IF THE RATES PAID IN THE UNITED KINGDOM FROM I89O99 WHEN THEY WERE FAIRLY CONSTANT BE REPRESENTED BY IOO THE RATES FROM I8809O SHOULD BE PUT AT GO THOSE FROM 187080 AT 95 FROM I86070 AT 75 FROM I85060 AT 65 FROM I84050 AT 60 FROM I83O40 AT 60

AUSTRALIAN CONSTITUTION HAD HE CONFINED HIS BOOK TO SUCH LOCAL TOPICS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN UNQUALI FIED SUCCESS OR HE MIGHT EVEN HAVE ADDED THE CHAPTER IN WHICH HE URGES THE TEACHING OF HISTORY AS A MEANS OF INCREASING THE INTELLIGENCE AND POLITICAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE VOTERS BUT THE REST OF THE BOOK IS OF NO VALUE TO THE ORDINARY STUDENT OF POLITICS SAVE AS A CLEAR AND WELL ARRANGED STATEMENT OF

MORE ESPECIALLY THE WORK OF JOHN ELIOT AND JONATHAN EDWARDS THE WORK CONCLUDES WITH A BRIEF CONSIDERATION OF SHAKESPEARES ATTITUDE TOWARD THE PURITANS THE AUTHOR BELIEVES THAT SHAKESPEARE AND THE PURITANS MISUNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER THAT THE LATTER SEEMED TO THE POET NARROW AND BIGOTED WHILE THEY IN THEIR TURN COULD RECOGNIZE ONLY THE SUPREME IMPORTANCE OF SPIRITUAL THINGS THE PURITANS ALSO WISHED TO ESTABLISH THE RIGHTS OF THE MIDDLE CLASSES WHEREAS SHAKESPEARE AND MANY OTHERS OF HIS CLASS WERE NOT INTERESTED IN THIS MOVEMENT AND THEREFORE PERHAPS IGNORED ITS TRUE IMPORTANCE A

ENGLISH TRADE AND WELLS AND TAUSSIG FOR INFORMATION TOUCHING THE TRADE OF THE UNITED STATES SAVES HIM FROM COMMITTING VERY SERIOUS BLUNDERS BUT WHEN HE DEPARTS FROM THE PATHS MARKED OUT BY THESE

OPENING ESSAY THE DEMOCRATIC EMPIRE THE AUTHOR STATES HIS POSITION CLEARLY AND FORCIBLY IT IS THAT DEMOCRACY AND EMPIRE ARE ENTIRELY HARMONIOUS UNDER THE DOMINION OF THE ANGLOSAXONS GREAT BRITAIN AND THE UNITED STATES HAVE STEADILY EXTENDED THEIR RULE IN THE LAST CENTURY AND JUST AS STEADILY HAVE THEY BECOME MORE DEMOCRATIC THIS PROCESS MAY BE CONTINUED IN THE FUTURE SAYS THE AUTHOR ALL ON THE ONE INVIOLABLE CONDITION THAT AS IT LENGTHENS THE REACH OF GOVERNMENT IT MUST CURTAIL THE FUNCTIONS OF GOVERNMENT THE VARIOUS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MAY UNDERTAKE WHAT THEY PLEASE BUT THE NATIONAL OR IMPERIAL GOVERNMENT MUST BE CONTENT TO LOSE IN INTENSITY WHAT IT GAINS IN EXTENT  IT MUST CONFINE ITSELF PRACTICALLY TO THREE THINGS NAMELY THE IMPERIAL DEFENCE THE SUPPRESSION OF CONFLICT BETWEEN ONE PART OF THE EMPIRE AND ANOTHER AND INSISTENCE THAT LOCAL ADMINISTRATION SHALL COME UP TO A CERTAIN STANDARD IN ITS PROTECTION OF LIFE AND PROPERTY AND IN ITS RESPECT FOR ENLIGHTENMENT 1 CONTRIBUTED BY MISS

NONRESISTANCE PROFESSOR GIDDINGS TRIES TO SHOW THAT THROUGH THE SPREAD OF THE DEMOCRATIC EMPIRE THE PRINCIPLE OF LIKE MINDEDNESS OF HOMOGENEITY IN FUNDAMEN TAL THINGS WILL BE SO FAR APPLIED THAT MEN MAY DIFFER ON MINOR SUBJECTS BUT IN THE ESSENTIAL THINGS WILL LOSE THE PREDATORY AGGRES SIVE HABIT AND THE HABIT OF RESISTANCE BY AGREEING WITH EACH OTHER IN THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF CIVIL

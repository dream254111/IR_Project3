stitution delivered before the academy March 24 an address on Recent Studies of the Sun Mr Abbot gave a summary of the re searches included in Volume II of the Annals of the Astrop1sical Observatory of the Smithsonian Institution now about to be issued Besides this he gave a brief account of the Smithsonian expedition to observe the total solar eclipse of January 3 1908 The mean value of the solar constant of radiation in calories per square centimeter per minute from 44 observations at Washing ton D C 19026 is 2061 from 59 observa tions on Mt Wilson California in 1905 it was 2024 and from 62 observations at Mt Wilson in 1906 it was 2020 Langley thought it necessary to add about one third to his solar constant value from Mt Whitney observations of 1881 because of a supposed failure of Bou guers transmission formula This correction does not appear to be justified and Langleys values should be as follows For Lone Pine 206 for Mountain Camp 222 and their dif ference is reasonably attributed to experi mental error not difference of altitude The fact that so good agreement between the Washington Lone Pine Mt Wilson and Mt Whitney values is found makes it most prob able that the true solar constant value differs very little from 21 calories It was shown from the temperature of the earths radiating surface that the solar constant can not exceed 233 calories unless the reflecting power of the earth as a planet exceeds 37 per cent The latter value was derived by measuring the reflecting power of clouds and other terrestrial surfaces Variations of the solar constant values were noted both in Washington and on Mt Wilson and these are so large and so well established by observation as to warrant the continuation of solar constant work at two observatories in cloudless regions of the earth well separated from one another A study of the surface temperatures of the earth at 48 inland sta tions widely distributed over the globe indi cates that general variations of temperature have occurred which may have been caused by solar variations of short period The sun spot cycle is clearly associated with a tem perature variation for higher temperatures occur at sunspot minimum The variation of brightness of the suns disk from center to limb has been observed for various wavelengths of light and on nu merous days of observation Changes of the rate of this variation have been noted from time to time and these changes may prove to be associated with variations of the solar con stant of radiation Probably the cause of the decreased brightness near the suns limb is the lower temperature of the sources of light near the limb due to the fact that the scattering of light by the molecules of the gases of the sun prevents us from seeing as deep near the limb as at the center of the disk The scat tering of rays is so great in the atmosphere of the earth that reasoning by analogy scat tering probably prevents us from seeing at the center of the suns disk as much as 1 per cent of the solar radius below the outer photo spheric layers and far less even than this at the suns limb owing to the greater length of path of the rays to a layer of given depth This explains the apparently sharp boundary of the suns disk notwithstanding the neces sity of admitting the gaseous nature of the sun on account of its extremely high tem perature The Smithsonian Institution sent Messrs Abbot and Moore to Flint Island by invitation of Director Campbell of the Lick Observatory They observed there on January 3 1908 the intensity of the rays of the solar corona at five points and found them at brightest only 11000000 as bright as sun rays They em ployed a bolometer in focus of a twentyinch equatorial reflecting telescope Glass was in front of the bolometer to prevent exchanges of long wavelength rays By means of an664 SCIENCE N S VOL XXVII No 695 asphaltum varnish screen it was found that the quality of coronal and solar radiation transmitted by glass differed little in relative proportion of visible and infrared rays From this and other observed facts it was inferred that the coronal radiation may probably be mostly reflected sun rays The absence of Fraunhofer lines in light of the inner corona was attributed to the bright line spectrum of hot gases in the corona superposed on the spectrum of reflection In the discussion that followed Mr Abbots address Professor Frank H Bigelow reviewed the difficulties of determining the solar con stant and Professor C F Marvin remarked upon the great ingenuity and skill shown dur ing this investigation in devising instruments and making observations in a difficult field MSr J F Hayford expressed his ardent admiration of the research presented in Mr Abbots address and stated that as he had heard of the research during its progress and read the proof of the complete paper of which his address is an abridgement his viewpoint was intermediate between that of the expert Mr Abbotand that of the audience According to Mr Hayford the grand tactics of this research are especially admirable They involve broad principles skilfully ap plied which are of general importance in any line of scientific research This has been a long investigation extend ing over a series of years The judgment of the investigator has bad time to become mature The investigator has been wise in extending the effective period of his investigation back ward by utilizing the work of those who came before him by being careful to supplement their work rather than to supersede it Sim ilarly he has greatly increased the forces brought to bear upon the problem by supple menting rather than by attempting to super sede or to repeat the work of contemporaries Mr Abbot has evidently been keen and skil ful in his search for the lines of least resist ance along which greatest progress may be made for a given expenditure of energy His reward has been the unusual progress made These are some of the reasons for confidence in this research for confidence that its only weak points are those pointed out by Mr Abbot by cautious wording in the formal printed report It may be well to emphasize certain ideas developed in this investigation which help one to see the earth in proper perspective  The true radiating surface of the earth as a planet is chiefly the water vapor of the at mosphere at an elevation of 4000 meters or more above the sea level In other words the man in the moon when he looks at the earth is in general blinded to the small con trasts in color on the surface of the earth by the light which comes to him from the air and its contents He secures but fleeting glimpses of the outlines of the continents The layer of air 13000 feet thick with its load of other material including water is a great blanket of peculiar kind such that it allows the suns radiation to penetrate down ward through it more readily than it allows the radiation to return upward in the some what changed form in which it then exists The result is that while the radiating layer has a temperature of about  100 C the sur face of the earth is maintained at about 140 C It seems to be conclusively proved that the amount of the radiation sent to us from the sun varies 5 per cent in each direction from its mean value The variation is irregular not periodic and the intervals of marked ex cess or defect are only a few days or a few weeks as a rule It was hoped at the beginning of this in vestigation that it might lead to the discovery of means of forecasting climatic conditions for some time in advance The investigation shows that the 5 per cent variation in the radiation produces only about 10 C change in temperature at favorable inland stations and a fraction of a degree only at island and coast stations This direct effect is therefore very small J S DILLER Recording Secretary

pages to the quite creditable list of popular treatises on the ferns of the northeastern United States and it has been given fitting form by the publishers Holt and Company of New York City The work is intended for amateurs and is in fact a popular manual based on analytical keys which can be used for the identification of ferns whether fruiting or not This is accomplished by having in addition to the usual key based on the fructification another which makes use of characters derived from the stalks alone In this the number and shape of the fibro vascular bundles are of primary importance but to these are added other characters as the size color ridges grooves etc of the surface of the stalks For the bundle characters good diagrams are used and throughout the work there are about two hundred admirable half tone reproductions of photographs which must prove very helpful to the student whether amateur or professional The keys refer to fuller descriptions of each species and these are all that one could wish in a book of this kind There is first a short somewhat tech nical description in smaller type and this is followed by a popular account which runs on with a charming freedom from convention ality There is no attempt to treat every species in the same manner on the contrary the author seems purposely to have varied his treatment often making an apt quotation of a stanza or two from some poem The nomenclature is nearly that of a decade or two ago but modern synonyms are given sufficiently to make the book usable by those who have access only to very recent manuals It is of little moment in a book of this kind what nomenclature is used and for this reason the omission of the authority for the species is of no consequence It is sufficient to say that the author knows ferns so well that his pronouncement may well be accepted by all amateur students of the ferns The book should have a wide circulation among the large number of people who love ferns and N S VOL XVIII No 468 want to know something about them It will also be found to be a very useful book in the library of the professional botanist ST LOUIS AND THE BOTANISTS IN a few weeks the botanists of the country will have the opportunity of visiting St Louis in order to attend the meetings of the botan ical section G of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the af filiated societies The botanical attractions are unusually great in St Louis The Mis souri Botanical Garden with its wealth of living plants in the extensive hothouses and the outofdoor plantations covering many acres of ground will interest every botanist who visits it Then there is the garden her barium one of the largest in America and very rich in type specimens and also the col lections of botanical works constituting the large garden library Here are the specimens and books which Dr George Engelmann studied and used and here are the rooms and buildings in which he worked To the younger generation of botanists these associations should be unusually attractive for it is help ful to see where and with what means those who preceded us have done their work There should be a full attendance of botanists at these meetings THE ECONOMIC PLANTS OF PORTO RICO SEVERAL years ago 0 F Cook and G N Collins were sent by the United States De partment of Agriculture to Porto Rico to make investigations in regard to the agricul ture of the island One result of their work has been the preparation of a thick pamphlet of somewhat more than two hundred octavo pages consisting of an annotated list of Porto Rican plants of economic importance It appears as one of the  Contributions from the United States National Herbarium Vol VIII part 2 under the supervision of the curator of botany Mr F V Coville In the short introduction reference is made to the books on the plants of the island in which the authors say that the botany of Porto Rico is far from complete and verySCIENCE little of it has been written in the English language    But two authors have at tempted a connected sketch of the Porto Rican flora and the efforts of these not only remain incomplete in that they do not cover the en tire series of families of flowering plants but the lists are also partial and local as the writers themselves realized The first of these sketches was that of Don Domingo Bello y Espinosa Apuntes para la flora de Puerto Rico 18811883    The second of these sketches and the most important contribution to the botany of Porto Rico is the Flora pro jected by Dr A Stahl of Bayamon but un fortunately only partially published Es tudios para la flora de PuertoRico 1884 1888    In spite of public indifference and official animosity six parts of the flora were issued at the expense of the author having been prepared in the intervals of his professional life as a physician Publication ceased in 1888 and Dr Stahl no longer hopes to continue the work Two other titles are given viz Diccionario botanico de los nombres vulgares cubanos y PuertoRiquenos by Manuel Gomez de la Maza and El medico botanico criollo by Rene de Grosourdy The catalogue proper consists of an alpha betical list of names common and scientific with descriptive notes and cross references Here the reader finds many interesting facts about tropical and semitropical plants which are or might be grown in Porto Rico and other West Indian islands One is struck after reading a few pages with the fact that there is much to be done on this island pos session of ours in order to develop its use of the plants which may be grown there with profit Coffee appears to be the most impor tant of the cultivated plants and yet we learn that the most careless and wasteful methods are practised in the culture of this important crop No attention is paid to the selection of seedlings most of the new plants being se cured from seeds that have germinated under the trees in the old plantations It is esti mated that by proper methods of cultivation the yield from the land now devoted to coffee could be doubled or tripled Similar state ments are made with reference to most of the 797 crops of the island Evidently there is a field of work here for the United States De partment of Agriculture and this volume is an indication that it is entering upon it with energy and ability CHARLES E BESSEY THE UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA THE CARNEGIE INSTITUTION THE newspaper reports in regard to the second annual meeting of the trustees of the Carnegie Institution held in Washington on December 9 read as follows  There were two sessions with a dinner follow ing The report submitted on the proceedings of the last year was supplemented by explanatory statements by Dr Gilman the president of the institution and by Dr Walcott the secretary The report on the years operations showed sixty six grants made by the executive committee for scientific research involving an aggregate of 150000 and recipients representing every part of the United States and the smaller colleges as well as the large universities observatories and laboratories Twentyfive research assistants were appointed These sums are exclusive of ad ministrative and incidental expenses of the insti tution The beneficiaries are given the option of making public the nature of these grants Ac tion on request for 1022 grants involving an allowance of 3000000 a year was indefinitely postponed Arrangements have been made for publication at an early day of eleven scientific papers most of them making large and costly volumes Among the subjects now under con sideration by the institution in connection with grants are a solar observatory southern observa tory geophysical laboratory Transcaspian ex ploration and archeological exploration explora tion in the south Pacific establishment of biological experiment laboratories and interna tional magnetic researches The morning session was devoted mostly to a discussion of several large projects No con clusion was announced The trustees authorized an aggregate expenditure of 373000 in grants for scientific researches and 40000 for publica tions during the ensuing year It is said that Mr Carnegie made a brief ad dress in which he commended the work already done and talked of the aim of the institution to give liberal encouragement in cooperation with other institutions to investigation research and discovery to provide buildings laboratories DECEMBER 18 1903

of the mean spheroid By an ingenious method partly graphical the author had found it prac ticable to take account of the influence of all known topographical features on the plumb line at more than 200 stations it is usually necessary to consider all the landmasses with in 2500 miles of the station When these computed deflections from known causes are combined with the deflections found from geodetic measurements the quantities to be accounted for by irregularities within the earths surface are usually much greater than had been supposed heretofore CHARLES K WEAD Secretary MICHIGAN

Powells Truth and Error a philo sophic distinction is made by giving special N S VOL XJXI No 524 definitions to the terms property and quality A property is an essential characteristic con sidered in itself a quality is a characteristic considered in relation to man Thus the ductility of iron is a property its utility a quality The form and coloration of a tree are properties its beauty or ugliness is a quality Irons property of ductility when thought of in connection with human needs is a factor of its quality of utility and the properties of the tree when viewed from the standpoint of mans esthetic sense are quali ties This simple distinction is of farreach ing application because properties are the domain of science and qualities the domain of art Pure science with a reservation in respect to anthropology is not at all con cerned with qualities and when the investi gator deals with them he passes into the field of applied science or the arts Failure to recognize this distinction leads to much con fusion of thought and expression One of the milder or less harmful but at the same time most conspicuous manifesta tions of this confusion is connected with the word interesting Not unfrequently an essay ostensibly and mainly scientific will contain the statement that an object or relation or other phenomenon is interesting the context indicating that interest is supposed to inhere in the phenomenon As a matter of fact interest is a mental attitude of the observer and the adjective interesting though ap plied to the phenomenon describes only the observers relation to it There are of course many legitimate uses of the adjective and some of these occur in scientific writings When an author for example declares that the insect habits he is about to describe are interesting to students of the psychology of the Bombocoreidse it is clear that he does not deceive himself by supposing that he has named a property of the phenomena Something similar may be said of important valuable etc when employed in scientific de scription In common with novel pertinent significant and the like they indicate the rela tions of phenomena to the condition of human knowledge Just as each observed fact has at some time temporarily the quality of noveltySCIENCE so each fact and inference may in some phase of the progress of knowledge serve to explain the previously unexplained and thus have importance or comparative value Apart from such temporary and humanistic rela tions all facts are equally important or equally unimportant When therefore an author makes the bald statement that a fact is  im portant he ascribes to it a quality and not a property and he is selfdeceived if he thinks of the importance as an essential character istic It conduces to clear thinking as well as clear writing if one fortifies the use of in teresting or important by pointing out the relation which endows the indicated fact with interest or importance When that has been done the need for the adjective often disap pears and if it can not be done the adjective is a meaningless platitude G K GILBERT WASHINGTON D C SPECIALIZATION IGNORANCE AND SOME PROPOSED PALLIATIVES I BEG leave to use the columns of SCIENCE to express a few ideas which may strike some readers as strangely naive but which have been incubating in my brain for a term of years and must now at length find some mode of deliverance I speak as one of that large class of unfortunates who aspire to contribute a few small stones to the temple of knowledge but who are forced to give so much time to purely routine work that little is left for better things And that precious little remnant of our timehow do we employ it Largely in misspent energy and unproductive effcrts iot in the quest of knowledge but of the means of acquiring knowledge not in learning facts but in learning how to learn After we have deducted the time spent in purely mechanical operations in developing our technique and in digesting the evergrowing literature of our particular little fraction of a subscience how much remains of those brief moments spared from the struggle for bread Is it a wonder that general culture suffers when even our sister sciences are neglected or that specializa tion so often results in an intellectual isola 69 tion fatal alike to the scientist and the man Platitudesof course they are Who has not deplored these conditions But we all resign ourselves to them as inevitable just as we do to a social order which tolerates boss rule Standard Oil and the inheritance of poverty or riches Who has not wished to halt the march of discovery long enough to allow himself to  catch up   And seriously would it be a misfortune if we should be com pelled to pause for a moment in the exploita tion of new facts and properly assimilate the ones we have But this is not the burden of my modest message One can not but marvel at the absence of any adequate bureau of exchange among specialists in different fields of knowledge We have our societies it is true where papers are presented which are oftentimes too technical even for the limited circle of membersall fellow specialists in a single science We have our journals congested with contribu tions good bad and indifferent But which one of us can follow all the technical journals of his own specialty even though his path be blazed by international bibliographic cata logues  We have our reviews and yearbooks and Jahresberichten in which the topics treated are apt to gain in technicality in pro portion to the degree of abridgment Various semipopular periodicals doubtless do a splendid work in making accessible some of the more general conclusions of science but their contents are necessarily fragmentary and uncoordinated In our higher educational institutions we find specialists engaged in two chief pursuits giving instruction to students and conducting research A third possible function of the faculty seems never to be fully recognized namely mutual enlightenment Why is there often such utter isolation between various departments  Why has there npot been estab lished any recognized clearinghouse for the exchange of expert knowledge Much of such exchange doubtless occurs in a desultory and haphazard way through ordinary social inter course so that a man of requisite personal and social gifts may receive and impart much of value And doubtless various public lecture JANUARY 13 1905

INTENDED FOR A MORE COMMO DIOUS METHOD OF FINDING THE LATITUDE AT SEA BY TWO OBSERVATIONS OF THE SUN BY H PEMBERTON M D R S LOND ET R A BEROL S A S IT HAPPENS NOT UNFREQUENTLY AT SEA FOR THE UNSEASONABLE INTERVEN TION OF CLOUDS TO PREVENT THE ORDINARY METHOD OF DE TERMINING THE SHIPS LATITUDE BY THE SUNS MERIDIAN ALTITUDE EVEN WHEN IT IS OF PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE THAT THE TRUE LATITUDE SHOULD BE KNOWN A PROBLEM FOR REMEDYING THIS DISAPPOINTMENT IS STATED IN MANY TREATISES OF NAVIGATION FOR FINDING THE LATITUDE OF A PLACE BY ANY TWO ALTITUDES OF THE SUN WITH THE INTER VAL OF TIME BETWEEN THEM READ NOV 20 1760 A PROBLEM SIMILAR TO THIS IS PROPOSED AND SOLVED INSTRUMENTALLY UPON A GLOBE BY A VERY EARLY WRITER PETRUS NONIUS A NAMELY TO FIND THE LATITUDE BY TWO ALTITUDES OF THE SUN AND THE ANGLE MADE BY THE AZIMUTH CIRCLES PASSING THROUGH THE SUN WHEN THE ALTITUDES ARE TAKEN AND SINCE MORE COMMODIOUS AND ACCURATE INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING TIME HAVE BEEN INVENTED THAN WERE KNOWN TO THIS AUTHOR THE OTHER PROBLEM HAS BEEN PROPOSED FOR THE SAME PUR A IN LIBR DE OBSERV REGUL ET INSTRUM GEOMETR LIB II C 14 POSE911 POSE OF WHICH A CONSTRUCTION UPON THE PRINCIPLES OF THE STEREOGRAPHIC PROJECTION OF THE SPHERE IS EXHIBITED BY MR COLLINS IN HIS MARINERS PLAIN SCALE NEW PLANED B AND AS THE DIRECT METHOD OF SOLVING BOTH THESE PROBLEMS BY NUMBERS REQUIRES A DIVERSITY OF TRI GONOMETRICAL OPERATIONS A SET OF TABLES HAS LATELY BEEN PUBLISHED FOR A MORE COMPENDIOUS WAY OF COMPUTA TION IN THE PROBLEM WHERE THE INTERVAL OF TIME IS GIVEN WHEREBY THE SHIPS TRUE LATITUDE MAY BE VERY EXPEDITIOUSLY DERIVED FROM THE SHIPS DEAD RECKONING PROVIDED THE OBSERVATIONS ARE MADE WITHIN CERTAIN LI MITS OF TIME BUT HOWEVER WORTHY OF NOTICE THIS METHOD MAY BE NEW TABLES FOR THE PURPOSE ARE ALTOGETHER UNNE CESSARY IT CONSISTS OF TWO PARTS THE FIRST COMPUTES FROM THE LATITUDE EXHIBITED BY THE DEAD RECKONING OF THE SHIP THE DISTANCE FROM NOON OF THE MIDDLE TIME BETWEEN THE OBSERVATIONS AND THENCE THE TIME OF EITHER THE SECOND OPERATION COMPUTES FROM ONE OF THESE OBSERVATIONS WHAT SHOULD BE THE SUNS MERI DIAN ALTITUDE HAD THE SHIPS RECKONING GIVEN THE TRUE LATITUDE BUT IF THE LATITUDE ASSUMED FROM THAT RECKON ING IS ERRONEOUS THE ALTITUDE THUS COMPUTED WILL NOT BE CONFORMABLE TO IT HOWEVER IF THE TIMES FOR THE OBSERVATIONS ARE PROPERLY CHOSEN IT WILL MUCH BETTER AGREE TO THE TRUE LATITUDE AND THEREBY THE ASSUMED LATITUDE MAY BE MORE OR LESS CORRECTED BUT BOTH THESE OPERATIONS ARE AN IMMEDIATE CON SEQUENCE FROM THE PROPOSITION IN SPHERICAL TRIGONO METRY USUALLY

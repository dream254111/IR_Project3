Latitude at Sea by Two Observations of the Sun By H Pemberton M D R S Lond et R A Berol S,i206916,910 LXXXI Some Considerations on a late Treatise intituled A new Set of Logarithmic Solar Tables c intended for a more commo dious Method of finding the Latitude at Sea by Two Observations of the Sun by H Pemberton M D R S Lond et R A Berol S A S it happens not unfrequently at sea for the unseasonable interven tion of clouds to prevent the ordinary method of de termining the ships latitude by the suns meridian altitude even when it is of primary consequence that the true latitude should be known a problem for remedying this disappointment is stated in many treatises of navigation for finding the latitude of a place by any two altitudes of the sun with the inter val of time between them Read Nov 20 1760 A problem similar to this is proposed and solved instrumentally upon a globe by a very early writer Petrus Nonius a namely to find the latitude by two altitudes of the sun and the angle made by the azimuth circles passing through the sun when the altitudes are taken And since more commodious and accurate instruments for measuring time have been invented than were known to this author the other problem has been proposed for the same pur a In Libr De Observ Regul et Instrum Geometr lib ii c 14 pose911 pose of which a construction upon the principles of the stereographic projection of the sphere is exhibited by Mr Collins in his Mariners Plain Scale new planed b And as the direct method of solving both these problems by numbers requires a diversity of tri gonometrical operations a set of tables has lately been published for a more compendious way of computa tion in the problem where the interval of time is given whereby the ships true latitude may be very expeditiously derived from the ships dead reckoning provided the observations are made within certain li mits of time But however worthy of notice this method may be new tables for the purpose are altogether unne cessary It consists of two parts the first computes from the latitude exhibited by the dead reckoning of the ship the distance from noon of the middle time between the observations and thence the time of either the second operation computes from one of these observations what should be the suns meri dian altitude had the ships reckoning given the true latitude but if the latitude assumed from that reckon ing is erroneous the altitude thus computed will not be conformable to it however if the times for the observations are properly chosen it will much better agree to the true latitude and thereby the assumed latitude may be more or less corrected But both these operations are an immediate con sequence from the proposition in spherical trigono metry usually delivered under the name of the fourth axiom which is this That the square of the radius is to the rectangle under the sines of the sides con b Book iii p 35 taining912 taining any angle as the versed sine of that angle to the difference between the versed sines of the third side and of the difference between the sides contain taining the angle C F C F D D A A B B A A C F C F D D B B Hence if A be

this is the first operation in the treatise these re marks concern For in the rectangle the sin ABD  ABC2 x the sin A B D  A B C2 the first side when the obser vations are both made on the same side of noon and the second side of this rectangle when one observa tion is before noon and the other after is the sine of the distance of the middle time between the ob servations from noon and the other side is the sine of half the distance between the observations And in the new tables one column exhibits the arithme tical complement of the logarithmic sine of half the clapsed time and the next the logarithm of twice the sine of the middle time But moreover 12 rad x   A D    A C being equal to sin A D  A C2 x sin A D  A C2 the operation may be expressed more commodiously thus Rad914 Radq cos lat x cos decl  sin A B D  A B C2 x sin A B D  A B C2 sin A D  A C2 x sin A D  A C2 now requiring the common logarithmic sines only Again the square of the radius being as above to cos lat x cos decl  as the vers s A B C to vers s A C  vers s A F or as vers s A B D to vers s A D  vers s A F these analogies express the second operation which in this treatise is unneces sarily confined to the lesser angle A B C The co lumn in the table intituled Rising consists of loga rithmic versed sines which may be applied to either of the angles A B C or A B D promiscuously for here A F being equal to the excess of B C or B D above the arch B A assumed for the complement of the latitude the arches A C and A D in the pre ceding analogies will be the complements of the alti tudes observed if the latitude were truly assumed otherwise not but the difference of their versed sines will however be equal to the difference of the versed sines of the complements of the true latitudes for this is supposed in the first operation Therefore if one of the fourth terms of these analogies be de ducted from the versed sine of the complement of the greater altitude or the other from the versed sine of the complement of the lesser the remainder will be the same and exhibit a versed sine for the com plement of the suns altitude different from A F when B A is assumed different from the true latitude and nearer to the truth if the times for the observa tions are properly chosen But farther the two preceding analogies may be reduced to these Rad915 Radq cos lat x cos decl  sin 12 A B C q  12 rad x vers s A C  vers s A F And Radq cos lat x cos decl  sin 12 A B D q  12 rad x vers s A C  vers s A F Also Vers s A C  vers s A F  cos A F  cos A C and vers s A D  vers s A F  cos A F  cos A D And thus the common tables of sines will supply the use of this column of the new tables as well as the preceding The first example of this treatise wrought by the common tables Here the declination of the sun is stated at 11 17 N the altitude first taken being the lesser 46 55 the greater altitude 54 7 and the difference of time between the observations 1h 25m or 85m which divided by 4 gives 21 15 for the

truth thus The sum of the four first logarithms in the first of 1934402 the two former operations        o   Cosine of 46 29 23 983789 Sine of A B D  A B C2  18 42 25 950613 A B D  A B C2  10 37 30 A

declination of the sun added to this amounts to 46 30 31 the true latitude as directly com puted being 46 30 19 However it must not be expected that this me thod of computation will always converge thus expe ditiously to the true latitude Had these observations been made about 3 hours sooner in the day and with the same interval between them if the first al titude of the sun had been found 18 55 and the second 33 11 the latitude computed would come out wider from the truth than that assumed one exceeding and the other falling short of the true la titude which will lie between them and is nearly the same as above But if the lesser altitude had 6 B 2 been918 been 29 13 and the greater 40 in 9 degrees of north latitude the interval between the observations would have been nearly the same as before But if this latitude be sought by any latitude assumed near it the latitude computed according to the method above will fall more remote from the truth than that assumed and err the same way In general the error in the latitude assumed will bear to the error in the latitude computed nearly the ratio compounded of that of the rectangle under the radius and the cosine of the distance from noon of the middle point of time between the two obser vations to twice sin 12 A B C x sin 12 A B D and the ratio of rad x sin A F to sin B C x cos A B insomuch that the distance of the middle point of time between the two observations from noon is to be considered as the limit where these com putations shall cease to converge when the rect angle under the radius and the cosine of this distance from noon shall be to twice sin 12 A B C x sin 12 A B D or the cosine of this distance to the difference between the versed sine of this distance from the versed sine of hals CBD as sin BF x cos AB to rad x sin A F And the errors in the assumed and computed latitudes fall on different sides of the true latitude when both the observations are on the same side of noon and the zenith lies between the meridian sun and the elevated pole or when the ob ervations are one before and the other after noon if the meridian sun passes between the zenith and the elevated pole otherwise they fall on the same side of the true latitude However919 However the direct method of computation by the assistance of the natural sines will not be so much more operose than this compendium as may at first sight be imagined For the arch of a great circle being drawn through C and D forming the triangle B C D if the logarithmic cosine of B C or B D be added to the logarithmic tangent of half the angle C B D and the logarithmic sine of B C or B D be added to the logarithmic sine of half this angle the first sum is the logarithmic cotangent of the angle B C D and the second the logarithmic sine of half C D the base of the triangle Then in the triangle A C D from the sides now all given is to be com puted the angle A C D the difference between which and the angle above found B C D is the angle B C A when the zenith lies between the pole and the great circle through C D but when the zenith lies beyond that circle the angle B C A is either the sum of those angles or the supplement of that sum to a circle And in the last place if twice the loga rithmic sine of half this angle and the logarithmic sines of B C and A C are added together the sum after thrice the logarithm of the radius has been de ducted is the logarithm of half the excess of the natural cosine of B C  A C above the natural cosine of A B or the natural sine of the latitude according to the trigonometrical axiom which has been above

natural cosine of B C  A C that is of 42 50 07254379  natural cosine of A B or sine of the latitude Therefore the latitude is 46 30 19 But farther as in the cases where the above ap proximation takes place it is an advantage that the assumed latitude should be taken as near the true one921 one as can be the dead reckoning of the ship need not be intirely relied on for that purpose for the instrumental construction proposed by Mr Collins d will very readily give the true latitude as nearly as the instruments used can express and his method may be described thus Two straight lines AB AC being drawn in an angle cor responding with the distance in time between the observa tions and in one of the lines as A B the lengths A D A E being taken from any scale of tangents one equal to the tangent of half the sum and the other equal to the tangent of half the difference of the distance of the sun from the pole and from the zenith of the first observation and also the points F G taken in the other line in the same manner related to the other observation then circles being described on the two diameters D E F G the distance of A from one of the  of these circles will be the tan gent of half the complement of the latitude B C D F G E A Moreover as in the treatise which has given oc casion to this discourse it is proposed sometimes to take into consideration the ships motion during the time between the observations but imperfectly re gard being had to the change made by the ship in longitude only but the change in latitude also may be taken into consideration in the foregoing con d In the place above cited struction922 struction by making the angle B A C equal to the sum or difference of the interval of time and the change in the ships longitude according as that change is made towards the west or towards the east and then drawing a line from A not to the intersection of the circles but so that the portions of that line terminated by each of the circles may be the tangents of arches whose difference is half the change in the latitude which if made from the pole requires the portion of the line terminated at the circle whose diameter is D E to be shorter than the other and the contrary is required when the motion of the ship is towards the pole For determining the latitude by calculation if the distance of the sun in the first observation from the zenith of the second could be found this case would be reduced to the first wherein the ship is considered as stationary And for this purpose it has been pro posed to make an additional observation by an azi muth compass of the angle the ships course makes with the azimuth of the sun when the first altitude is taken and perhaps the same angle may be found with sufficient exactness from the latitude in the first observation assumed whether from the dead reckon ing or from the foregoing construction Why I have taken no notice of the calculations ex hibited by the author of the piece here animadverted on as proofs of his method will readily appear to those who shall cast their eye upon them S C H O L I U M The axiom in trigonometry on which the calcu lations here discoursed of have been shewn imme diately923 diately to depend was introduced by Regiomontanus and is still retained as the foundation of the present methods of computing logarithmically an angle from the three sides of a spherical triangle given though they may be demonstrated more directly by the fol lowing lemma C C D F H D H E F E B B G G A A In the circle A B C the chord A C being drawn and the arch A B C bisected in B if D be taken in the circle at pleasure and the lines B E D F drawn also at pleasure parallel to each other one terminated by the circle in E and the other by the chord A C in F then A D D C being drawn B E x D F is  A D x D C Draw D H perpendicular to A C and also the diameter B G joining E G Then the angles F D H E B G are equal and the angles D H F B E G right Therefore B E is to B G as D H to D F and B E x D F  B G x D H  A D x D C V O L LI 6 C Now924 Now in the spherical triangle A B C through B and to the poles A C let the semicircles E B F G B D be described and the arch A C completed to a circle Then the semicircles EBF G B D will be both perpendi cular to the plane of this circle cut it in their diameters E F G D and their common intersection B H be also perpendicular to it and consequently perpendicular to G D the diameter of the semicircle G B D whereby G B D B being joined G D x G H is equal to G Bq and G D x D H equal to B Dq Again A K being drawn parallel to G D the arch A C K is double A C G C D double C B E A D the sum of all the three sides of the triangle E G  E D  D G 2 C B G F  A F A E  C G C D  A C  E D  2 A C and F D  E D  E F 2 A B F C G H D A B K E Then E G G F F D E D being joined in the first place A K is to D G as A K x G H to D G x G H also A K to D G as A K x D G to D Gq but A K x G H  E G x G F by the preceding lemma and D G x G H  G Bq whereby A K x D G is to D Gq as E G x G F to G Bq Hence A K being twice the sine of the arch A C D G twice the sine of the arch G C equal to B C E G twice the sine of half the arch E A G G F twice925 twice the sine of half the arch GF  GB twice the sine of half the angle ACB to the radius of the circle GBD which is half GD sin AC x sin BC is to radq as sin 12 ED  BC x sin 12 ED  AC to sin 12 ACBq And this is Napiers first method of finding an angle from the three sides given e as it is usually delivered Again AK is to DG or AK x DG to DGq as AK x DH ED x DF to DG x DH or DBq Therefore DB being twice the sine of half the angle BCD or twice the cosine of half the angle ACB to the radius of the circle GBD as sin AC x sin CB to radq so is 12 ED x sin 12 ED  AB to cos 12 ACBq And this is Napeirs second method f And lastly the cosine of an arch or angle being to its sine as radius to the tangent sin 12 ED x sin 12 ED  AB will be to sin 12 ED  BC x sin 12 ED  AC as radq to tang 12 ACBq which is a third method added by Gellibrand g Moreover In plain triangles from the three sides given may an angle be found by a process similar to each of these as follows e  Canon Log descrip lib ii c 6  8 f

FD  2ED  2CB  2AB  2AC Hence GF is to GH as 2AC to EG whence GF x EG is  2AC x GH and DH is to ED as DF to 2AC that is 2AC x DH will be  ED x DF Thus 2AC DG  2AC x DG DGq  2AC x GH EG x GF DGH GBq and AC x CB radq 12 ED  CB x 12 ED  AC  sin 12 q Likewise 2AC DG  2AC x DG DGq  2AC x DH ED x DF GDH DBq therefore AC x CB radq 12ED x ED  AB cos 12 ACBq And in the last place 12 ED x 12 ED  AB  ED  CB x 12 ED  AC radq tang 12 ACBq 5 This927 This last proposition was first delivered by Gelli brand and the other two not long after by Oughtred in their respective treatises of Trigonometry BUT it may farther here be noted that from two sides of a plain triangle as AC CB with the angle between them ACB the third side AB may be found either by the first or second of the foregoing proportions for by the first may be found EG x GF that is AFq  AGq and by the second ED x DF or ADq  AFq whence by a table of squares AF  AB may be readily found for AG is equal to AC  BC and AD  AC  CB In like manner in the sphe rical triangle from the sides AC CB and the angle ACB may the third side be expedi tiously found with the aid of a table of natural sines by the axiom referred to in the be ginning of this discourse as modelled for this pur pose by Napeir in the proposition which has been already referred to h whereby the axiom is re duced to this analogy Radq sin AC x sin CB sin 12 ACB  rad x vers s AB

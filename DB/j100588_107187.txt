J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107187,ON THE DIRECTION OF THE RADICLE AND GERMEN DURING THE VEGETATION OF SEEDS,I206961,WA ON THE DIRECTION OF THE RADICLE AND GERIEN DURING THE VEGETATION OF SEEDS BY THOMAS ANDREW KNIGHT ESQ F R S IN A LETTER TO THE RIGHT HON SIR JOSEPH BANKS K B PO R S READ JANUA7RY 9 I8OG MY DEAR SIR IT CAN SCARCELY HAVE ESCAPED THE NOTICE OF THE MOST INATTEN TIVE OBSERVER OF VEGETATION THAT IN WHATEVER POSITION A SEED IS PLACED TO GERMINATE ITS RADICLE INVARIABLY MAKES AN EFFORT TO DESCEND TOWARDS THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH WHILST THE ELONGATED GERMEN TAKES A PRECISELY OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND IT HAS BEEN PROVED BY DU HAMEL  THAT IF A SEED DURING ITS GERMINATION BE FREQUENTLY INVERTED THE POINTS BOTH OF THE RADICLE AND GERMEN WILL RETURN TO THE FIRST DIRECTION SOME NATURALISTS HAVE SUPPOSED THESE OPPOSITE EFFECTS TO BE PRODUCED BY GRA VITATION  AND IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO CONCEIVE THAT THE SAME AGENT BY OPERATING ON BODIES SO DIFFERENTLY ORGANIZED AS THE RADICLE AND GERMEN OF PLANTS ARE MAY OCCASION THE ONE TO DESCEND AND THE OTHER TO ASCEND THE HYPOTHESIS OF THESE NATURALISTS DOES NOT HOWEVER APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN MUCH STRENGTHED BY ANY FACTS THEY WERE ABLE TO ADDUCE IN SUPPORT OF IT NOR MUCH WEAKENED BY THE ARGU MENTS OF THEIR OPPONENTS AND THEREFORE AS THE PHENOMENA PHYSIQUE DE5 ARBRESMR KNIGHT ON THE DIRECTION OF OBSERVABLE DURING THE CONVERSION OF A SEED INTO A PLANT ARE AMONGST THE MOST INTERESTING THAT OCCUR IN VEGETATION I COMMENCED THE EXPERIMENTS AN ACCOUNT OF WHICH I HAVE NOW THE HONOUR TO REQUEST YOU TO LAY BEFORE THE ROYAL SOCIETY I CONCEIVED THAT IF GRAVITATION WERE THE CAUSE OF THE DESCENT OF THE RADICLE AND OF THE ASCENT OF THE GERMEN IT MUST ACT EITHER BY ITS IMMEDIATE INFLUENCE ON THE VEGETABLE FIBRES AND VESSELS DURING THEIR FORMATION OR ON THE MOTION AND CONSE QUENT DISTRIBUTION OF THE TRUE SAP AFFORDED BY THE COTYLEDONS AND AS GRAVITATION COULD PRODUCE THESE EFFECTS ONLY WHILST THE SEED REMAINED AT REST AND IN THE SAME POSITION RELATIVE TO THE ATTRACTION OF THE EARTH I IMAGINED THAT ITS OPERATION WOULD BECOME SUSPENDED BY CONSTANT AND RAPID CHANGE OF THE POSI TION OF THE GERMINATING SEED AND THAT IT MIGHT BE COUNTER ACTED BY THE AGENCY OF CENTRIFUGAL FORCE HAVING A STRONG RILL OF WATER PASSING THROUGH MY GARDEN I CONSTRUCTED A SMALL WHEEL SIMILAR TO THOSE USED FOR GRINDING CORN ADAPTING ANOTHER WHEEL OF A DIFFERENT CONSTRUCTION AND FORMED OF VERY SLENDER PIECES OF WOOD TO THE SAME AXIS ROUND THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE LATTER WHICH WAS ELEVEN INCHES IN DIAMETER NUMEROUS SEEDS OF THE GARDEN BEAN WHICH HAD BEEN SOAKED IN WATER TO PRODUCE THEIR GREATEST DEGREE OF EXPANSION WERE BOUND AT SHORT DISTANCES FROM EACH OTHER THE RADICLES OF THESE SEEDS WERE MADE TO POINT IN EVERY DIRECTION SOME TOWARDS THE CENTRE OF THE WHEEL AND OTHERS IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OTHERS AS TANGENTS TO ITS CURVE SOME POINTING BACKWARDS AND OTHERS FORWARDS RELATIVE TO ITS MOTION AND OTHERS POINTING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS IN LINES PARALLEL WITH THE AXIS OF THE WHEELS THE WHOLE WAS INCLOSED IN A BOX AND SECURED BY A LOCK AND A WIRE GRATE WAS PLACED 100THE RADICLE AND GERMEN OF SEEDS TO PREVENT THE INGRESS OF ANY BODY CAPABLE OF IMPEDING THE MOTION OF THE WHEELS THE WATER BEING THEN ADMITTED THE WHEELS PERFORMED SOMETHING MORE THAN 15O REVOLUTIONS IN A MINUTE AND THE POSITION OF THE SEEDS RELATIVE TO THE EARTH WAS OF COURSE AS OFTEN PERFECTLY INVERTED WITHIN THE SAME PERIOD OF TIME BY WHICH I CONCEIVE THAT THE INFLUENCE OF GRAVITATION MUST HAVE BEEN WHOLLY SUSPENDED IN A FEW DAYS THE SEEDS BEGAN TO GERINNATE AND AS THE TRUTH OF SOME OF THE OPINIONS I HAD COMMUNICATED TO YOU AND OF MANY OTHERS WHICH I HAD LONG ENTERTAINED DEPENDED ON THE RESULT OF THE EXPERIMENT I WATCHED ITS PROGRESS WITH SOME ANXIETY THOUGH NOT WITH MUCH APPREHENSION AND I HAD SOON THE PLEASURE TO SEE THAT THE RADICLES IN WHATEVER DIRECTION THEY WERE PROTRUDED FROM THE POSITION OF THE SEED TURNED THEIR POINTS OUTWARDS FROM THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE WHEEL AND IN THEIR SUBSEQUENT GROWTH RECEDED NEARLY AT RIGHT ANGLES FROM ITS AXIS THE GERMENS ON THE CONTRARY TOOK THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND IN A FEW DAYS THEIR POINTS ALL MET IN THE CENTRE OF THE WHEEL THREE OF THESE PLANTS WERE SUF FERED TO REMAIN ON THE WHEEL AND WERE SECURED TO ITS SPOKES TO PREVENT THEIR BEING SHAKEN OFF BY ITS MOTION THE STEMS OF THESE PLANTS SOON EXTENDED BEYOND THE CENTRE OF THE WHEEL BUT THE SAME CAUSE WHICH FIRST OCCASIONED THEM TO APPROACH ITS AXIS STILL OPERATING THEIR POINTS RETURNED AND MET AGAIN AT ITS CENTRE THE MOTION OF THE WHEEL BEING IN THIS EXPERIMENT VERTICAL THE RADICLE AND GERMEN OF EVERY SEED OCCUPIED DURING A MINUTE PORTION OF TIME IN EACH REVOLUTION PRECISELY THE SAME POSITION THEY WOULD HAVE ASSUMED HAD THE SEEDS VEGETATED AT 101MR KNIGHT ON THE DIRECTION OF REST AND AS GRAVITATION AND CENTRIFUGAL FORCE ALSO ACTED IN LINES PARALLEL WITH THE VERTICAL MOTION AND SURFACE OF THE WHEEL I CONCEIVED THAT SOME SLIGHT OBJECTIONS MIGHT BE URGED AGAINST THE CONCLUSIONS I FELT INCLINED TO DRAW I THEREFORE ADDED TO THE MACHINERY I HAVE DESCRIBED ANOTHER WHEEL WHICH MOVED HORIZONTALLY OVER THE VERTICAL WHEELS AND TO THIS BY MEANS OF MULTIPLYING WHEELS OF DIFFERENT POWERS I WAS ENABLED TO GIVE MANY DIFFERENT DEGREES OF VELOCITY4 ROUND THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE HORIZONTAL WHEEL WHOSE DIA METER WAS ALSO ELEVEN INCHES SEEDS OF THE BEAN WERE BOUND AS IN THE EXPERIMENT WHICH I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED AND IT WAS THEN MADE TO PERFORM 50O REVOLUTIONS IN A MINUTE BY THE RAPID MOTION OF THE WATERWHEEL MUCH WATER WAS THROWN UPWARDS ON THE HORIZONTAL WHEEL PART OF WHICH SUPPLIED THE SEEDS UPON IT WITH MOISTURE AND THE REMAINDER WAS DIS PERSED IN A LIGHT AND CONSTANT SHOWER OVER THE SEEDS IN THE VERTICAL WHEEL AND ON OTHERS PLACED TO VEGETATE AT REST IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BOX EVERY SEED ON THE HORIZONTAL WHEEL THOUGH MOVING WITH GREAT RAPIDITY NECESSARILY RETAINED THE SAME POSITION RELATIVE TO THE ATTRACTION OF THE EARTH AND THEREFORE THE OPERATION OF GRAVITATION COULD NOT BE SUSPENDED THOUGH IT MIGHT BE COUN TERACTED IN A VERY CONSIDERABLE DEGREE BY CENTRIFUGAL FORCE AND THE DIFFERENCE I HAD ANTICIPATED BETWEEN THE EFFECTS OF RAPID VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL MOTION SOON BECAME SUFFICIENTLY OBVIOUS THE RADICLES POINTED DOWNWARDS ABOUT TEN DEGREES BELOW AND THE GERMENS AS MANY DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZONTAL LINE OF THE WHEELS MOTION CENTRIFUGAL FORCE HAVING MADE BOTH TO DEVIATE 8O DEGREES FROM THE PERPENDICULAR DIRECTION EACH WOULD HAVE TAKEN HAD IT VEGETATED AT REST GRADUALLYTHE RADICLE AND GERMEN OF SEEDS DIMINISHING THE RAPIDITY OF THE MOTION OF THE HORIZONTAL WHEEL THE RADICLES DESCENDED MORE PERPENDICULARLY AND THE GERMENS GREW MORE IJPRIGHT AND WHEN IT DID NOT PERFORM MORE THAN 8O REVOLUTIONS IN A MINUTE THE RADICLE POINTED ABOUT 45 DEGREES BELOW AND THE GERMEN AS MUCH ABOVE THE HORIZONTAL LINE THE ONE ALWAYS RECEDING FROM AND THE OTHER APPROACHING TO THE AXIS OF THE WHEEL I WOULD NOT HOWEVER BE UNDERSTOOD TO ASSERT THAT THE VELOCITY OF 250 OR OF 80 HORIZONTAL REVOLUTIONS IN A MINUTE WILL ALWAYS GIVE ACCURATELY THE DEGREES OF DEPRESSION AND ELEVATION OF THE RADICLE AND GERMEN WHICH I HAVE MENTIONED FOR THE RAPIDITY OF THE MOTION OF MY WHEELS WAS SOMETIMES DIMINISHED BY THE COLLECTION OF FIBRES OF CONFERVA AGAINST THE WIRE GRATE WHICH OBSTRUCTED IN SOME DEGREE THE PASSAGE OF THE WATER AND THE MACHINERY HAVING BEEN THE WORKMANSHIP OF MYSELF AND MY GARDENER CAN NOT BE SUPPOSED TO HAVE MOVED WITH ALL THE REGULARITY IT MIGHT HAVE DONE HAD IT BEEN MADE BY A PROFESSIONAL MECHANIC BUT I CONCEIVE MYSELF TO HAVE FULLY PROVED THAT THE RADICLES OF GERMINATING SEEDS ARE MADE TO DESCEND AND THEIR GERMENS TO ASCEND BY SOME EX TERNAL CAUSE AND NOT BY ANY POWER INHERENT IN VEGETABLE LIFE AND I SEE LITTLE REASON TO DOUBT THAT GRAVITATION IS THE PRINCIPAL IF NOT THE ONLY AGENT EMPLOYED IN THIS CASE BY NATURE I SHALL THEREFORE ENDEAVOUR TO POINT OUT THE MEANS BY WHICH I CONCEIVE THE SAME AGENT MAY PRODUCE EFFECTS SO DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSITE TO EACH OTHER THE RADICLE OF A GERMINATING SEED AS MANY N IR STS HAVE OBSERVED IS SCREAIED IE N TIENGTL Y Y NEW PARIN SUCCESSIVELY ADED TO  E O A AI  Y LOSMR KNIGHT ON THE DIRECTION OF GENERAL EXTENSION OF PARTS ALREADY FORMED AND THE NEW MATTER WHICH IS THUS SUCCESSIVELY ADDED UNQUESTIONABLY DE SCENDS IN A FLUID STATE FROM THE COTYLEDONS ON THIS FLUID AND ON THE VEGETABLE FIBRES AND VESSELS WHILST SOFT AND FLEXIBLE AND WHILST THE MATTER WHICH COMPOSES THEM IS CHANGING FROM A FLUID TO A SOLID STATE GRAVITATION I CONCEIVE WOULD OPERATE SUFFICIENTLY TO GIVE AN INCLINATION DOWNWARDS TO THE POINT OF THE RADICLE AND AS THE RADICLE HAS BEEN PROVED TO BE OBEDIENT TO CENTRIFUGAL FORCE IT CAN SCARCELY BE CON TENDED THAT ITS DIRECTION WOULD REMAIN UNINFLUENCED BY GRA VITATION I HAVE STATED THAT THE RADICLE IS INCREASED IN LENGTH ONLY BY PARTS SUCCESSIVELY ADDED TO ITS POINT THE GERMEN ON THE CONTRARY ELONGATES BY A GENERAL EXTENSION OF ITS PARTS PRE VIOUSLY ORGANIZED AND ITS VESSELS AND FIBRES APPEAR TO EXTEND THEMSELVES IN PROPORTION TO THE QUANTITY OF NUTRIMENT THEY RECEIVE IF THE MOTION AND CONSEQUENT DISTRIBUTION OF THE TRUE SAP BE INFLUENCED BY GRAVITATION IT FOLLOWS THAT WHEN THE GERMEN AT ITS FIRST EMISSION OR SUBSEQUENTLY DEVIATES FROM A PERPENDICULAR DIRECTION THE SAP MUST ACCUMULATE ON ITS UNDER SIDE AND I HAVE FOUND IN A GREAT VARIETY OF EXPERIMENTS ON THE SEEDS OF THE HORSE CHESNUT THE BEAN AND OTHER PLANTS WHEN VEGETATING AT REST THAT THE VESSELS AND FIBRES ON THE UNDER SIDE OF THE GERMEN INVARIABLY ELONGATE MUCH MORE RAPIDLY THAN THOSE ON ITS UPPER SIDE AND THENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT THE POINT OF THE GERMEN MUST ALWAYS TURN UPWARDS AND IT HAS BEEN PROVED THAT A SIMILAR INCREASE OF GROWTH TAKES PLACE ON THE EXTERNAL SIDE OF THE GERMEN WHEN THE SAP  SEE PHIL TRANS OF O805 10 OILTHE RADICLE AZND GERINEN OF SEEDS 105 IS IMPELLED THERE BY CENTRIFUGAL FORCE AS IT IS ATTRACTED BY GRAVITATION TO ITS UNDER SIDE WHEN THE SEED GERMINATES AT REST THIS INCREASED ELONGATION OF THE FIBRES AND VESSELS OF THE UNDER SIDE IS NOT CONFINED TO THE GERMENS NOR EVEN TOTHE ANNUAL SHOOTS OF TREES BUT OCCURS AND PRODUCES THE MOST EX TENSIVE EFFECTS IN THE SUBSEQUENT GROWTH OF THEIR TRUNKS AND BRANCHES THE IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF GRAVITATION IS CERTAINLY TO OCCASION THE FURTHER DEPRESSION OF EVERY BRANCH WHICH EXTENDS HORIZONTALLY FROM THE TRUNK OF THE TREE AND WHEN A YOUNG TREE INCLINES TO EITHER SIDE TO INCREASE THAT INCLINATION BUT IT AT THE SAME TIME ATTRACTS THE SAP TO THE UNDER SIDE AND THUS OCCASIONS AN INCREASED LONGITUDINAL EXTENSION OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE NEW WOOD ON THAT SIDE THE DEPRESSION OF THE LATERAL BRANCH IS THUS PREVENTED AND IT IS EVEN ENABLED TO RAISE ITSELF ABOVE ITS NATURAL LEVEL WHEN THE BRANCHES ABOVE IT ARE REMOVED AND THE YOUNG TREE BY THE SAME MEANS BECOMES MORE UPRIGHT IN DIRECT OPPOSITION TO THE IMMEDIATE ACTION OF GRAVITATION NATURE AS USUAL EXECUTING THE MOST IMPORTANT OPERATIONS BY THE MOST SIMPLE MEANS I COULD ADDUCE MANY MORE FACTS IN SUPPORT OF THE PRECEDING DEDUCTIONS BUT THOSE I HAVE STATED I CONCEIVE TO BE SUFFI CIENTLY CONCLUSIVE IT HAS HOWEVER BEEN OBJECTED BY DU HAMEL AND THE GREATEST DEFERENCE IS ALWAYS DUE TO HIS OPINIONS THAT GRAVITATION COULD HAVE LITTLE INFLUENCE ON THE DIRECTION OF THE GERMEN WERE IT IN THE FIRST INSTANCE PROTRUDED OR WERE IT SUBSEQUENTLY INVERTED AND MADE TO  THIS EFFECT DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE PRODUCED IN WHAT ARE CALLED WEEPING TREES THE CAUSE OF WHICH I HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO POINT OUT IN A FORMER MEMOIR PHIL TRANS 804 MDCCCVL PMR KNIGIIT ON THE DIRECTION OF POINT PERPENDICULARLY DOWNWARDS TO ENABLE MYSELF TO ANSWER THIS OBJECTION I MADE MANY EXPERIMENTS ON SEEDS OF THE HORSE CHESNUT AND OF THE BEAN IN THE BOX I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED AND AS THE SEEDS THERE WERE SUSPENDED OUT OF THE EARTH I COULD REGULARLY WATCH THE PROGRESS OF EVERY EFFORT MADE BY THE RADICLE AND GERMEN TO CHANGE THEIR POSITIONS THE EXTREMITY OF THE RADICLE OF THE BEAN WHEN MADE TO POINT PERPENDICULARLY UPWARDS GENERALLY FORMED A CONSIDERABLE CURVATURE WITHIN THREE OR FOUR HOURS WHEN THE WEATHER WAS WARM THE GERMEN WAS MORE SLUGGISH BUT IT RARELY OR NEVER FAILED TO CHANGE ITS DIRECTION IN THE COURSE OF TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND ALL MY EFFORTS TO MAKE IT GROW DOWNWARDS BY SLIGHTLY CHANGING ITS DIRECTION WERE INVARIABLY ABORTIVE ANOTHER AND APPARENTLY A MORE WEIGHTY OBJECTION TO THE PRECEDING HYPOTHESIS IF APPLIED TO THE SUBSEQUENT GROWTH AND FORMS OF TREES ARISES FROM THE FACTS THAT FEW OF THEIR BRANCHES RISE PERPENDICULARLY UPWARDS AND THAT THEIR ROOTS ALWAYS SPREAD HORIZONTALLY BUT THIS OBJECTION I THINK MAY BE READILY ANSWERED THE LUXURIANT SHOOTS OF TREES WHICH ABOUND IN SAP ILL WHATEVER DIRECTION THEY ARE FIRST PROTRUDED ALMOST UNIFORMLY TURN UPWARDS AND ENDEAVOUR TO ACQUIRE A PERPENDICULAR DI RECTION AND TO THIS THEIR POINTS WILL IMMEDIATELY RETURN IF THEY ARE BENT DOWNWARDS DURING ANY PERIOD OF THEIR GROWTH THEIR CURVATURE UPWARDS BEING OCCASIONED BY AN INCREASED EXTENSION OF THE FIBRES AND VESSELS OF THEIR UNDER SIDES AS IN THE ELONGATED GERMENS OF SEEDS THE MORE FEEBLE AND SLENDER SHOOTS OF THE SAME TREES WILL ON THE CONTRARY GROW IN ALMOST EVERY DIRECTION PROBABLY BECAUSE THEIR FIBRES BEING MORE IRY AND THEIR VESSELS LESS AMPLY SUPPLIED WITH SAP THEY ARE IO6THE RADICLE AND GERMEN OF SEEDS LESS AFFECTED BY GRAVITATION THEIR POINTS HOWEVER GENERALLY SHEW AN INCLINATION TO TURN UPWARDS BUT THE OPERATION OF LIGHT IN THIS CASE HAS BEEN PROVED BY BONNET TO BE VERY CONSIDERABLE THE RADICLE TAPERS RAPIDLY AS IT DESCENDS INTO THE EARTH AND ITS LOWER PART IS MUCH COMPRESSED BY THE GREATER SOLIDITY OF THE MOULD INTO WHICH IT PENETRATES THE TRUE SAP ALSO CON TINUES TO DESCEND FROM THE COTYLEDONS AND LEAVES AND OCCA SIONS A CONTINUED INCREASE OF THE GROWTH OF THE UPPER PARTS OF THE RADICLE AND THIS GROWTH IS SUBSEQUENTLY AUGMENTED BY THE EFFECTS OF MOTION WHEN THE GERMEN HAS RISEN ABOVE THE GROUND THE TRUE SAP IS THEREFORE NECESSARILY OBSTRUCTED IN ITS DESCENT NUMEROUS LATERAL ROOTS ARE GENERATED INTO WLHICH A PORTION OF THE DESCENDING SAP ENTERS THE SUBSTANCE OF THESE ROOTS LIKE THAT OF THE SLENDER HORIZONTAL BRANCHES IS MUCH LESS SUCCULENT THAN THAT OF THE RADICLE FIRST EMITTED AND THEY ARE IN CONSEQUENCE LESS OBEDIENT TO GRAVITATION AND THEREFORE MEETING LESS RESISTANCE FROM THE SUPERFICIAL SOIL THAN FROM THAT BENEATH IT THEY EXTEND HORIZONTALLY IN EVERY DIRECTION GROWING WITH MOST RAPIDITY AND PRODUCING THE GREATEST NUMBER OF RAMIFICATIONS WHEREVER THEY FIND MOST WARMTH AND A SOIL BEST ADAPTED TO NOURISH THE TREE AS THESE HORIZONTAL OR LATERAL ROOTS SURROUND THE BASE OF THE TREE ON EVERY SIDE THE TRUE SAP DESCENDING DOWN ITS BARK ENTERS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY INTO THEM AND THE FIRST PERPENDICULAR ROOT HAVING EXECUTED ITS OFFICE OF SECURING MOISTURE TO THE PLANT WHILST YOUNG IS THUS DEPRIVED OF PROPER NUTRIMENT AND CEASING ALMOST WHOLLY TO GROW BECOMES OF NO IMPORT ANCE TO THE TREE THE TAP ROOT OF THE OAK ABOUT WHICH SO  REBERCBES SUR LUSAGE DES FEUILLES DANS LES PLANTES P 2 IO7O8 MR KNIGHT ON THE DIRECTION OF RADICLES C MUCH HAS BEEN WRITTEN WILL POSSIBLY BE ADDUCED AS AN EXCEP TION BUT HAVING ATTENTIVELY EXAMINED AT LEAST 20000 TREES OF THIS SPECIES MANY OF WHICH HAD GROWN IN SOME OF THE DEEPEST AND MOST FAVOURABLE SOILS OF ENGLAND AND NEVER HAVING FOUND A SINGLE TREE POSSESSING A TAP ROOT I MUST BE ALLOWED TO DOUBT THAT ONE EVER EXISTED AS TREES POSSESS THE POWER TO TURN THE UPPER SURFACES OF THEIR LEAVES AND THE POINTS OF THEIR SHOOTS TO THE LIGHT AND THEIR TENDRILS IN ANY DIRECTION TO ATTACH THEMSELVES TO CONTI GUOUS OBJECTS IT MAY BE SUSPECTED THAT THEIR LATERAL ROOTS ARE BY SOME MEANS DIRECTED TO ANY SOIL IN THEIR VICINITY WHICH IS BEST CALCULATED TO NOURISH THE PLANT TO WHICH THEY BELONG AND IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT MUCH THE GREATER PART OF THE ROOTS OF AN AQUATIC PLANT WHICH HAS GROWN IN A DRY SOIL ON THLE MARGIN OF A LAKE OR RIVER HAVE BEEN FOUND TO POINT TO THE WATER WHILST THOSE OF ANOTHER SPECIES OF TREE WHICH THRIVES BEST IN A DRY SOIL HAVE BEEN ASCERTAINED TO TAKE AN OPPOSITE DIRECTION BUT THE RESULT OF SOME EXPERIMENTS I HAVE MADE IS NOT FAVOURABLE TO THIS HYPOTHESIS AND I AM RATHER INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT THE ROOTS DISPERSE THEMSELVES IN EVERY DIRECTION AND ONLY BECOME MOST NUMEROUS WHERE THEY FIND MOST EM PLOYMENT AND A SOIL BEST ADAPTED TO THE SPECIES OF PLANT MY EXPERIMENTS HAVE NOT HOWEVER BEEN SUFFICIENTLY VARIED OR NUMEROUS TO DECIDE THIS QUESTION WHICH I PROPOSE TO MAKE THE SUBJECT OF FUTURE INVESTIGATION I AM C T A IKNGH T ELTON NOV 22 18O5

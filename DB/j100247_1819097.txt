j100247,Journal of Political Economy,1819097,The Aldrich Bill,i331548,NOTES THE ALDRICH BILL The measure proposed in the Senate to remedy our mnonetary and financial ills furnishes another example of the deadening effect of politics and of a lack of expert knowledge in regard to banking upon Congress Nothing could better show the utter misunder standing of the events we have just passed through than the scheme proposed by the leaders of the Senate Of course it will be urged that nothing really sane could be passed but to this it should be replied that the proposal of a really sound measure would have educated the public and in the end would have helped on the possibility of a right solution In the first place the authors of the bill quite fail to comprehend that in the recent crisis the inability of banks to lend to needy bor rowers was the central difficulty which brought on failures and cessation of business If loans could have been had many a con cern would have been able to meet its obligations and continue its productive operations What limited the power of the banks to lend Primarily the limited capital already at their disposal which had been stretched to its utmost capacity and directly the ratio of lawful reserves to demand liabilities in the form of deposits Since only about 5 per cent of a banks receipts in New York are in cur rency the deposits are in the main the result of loans To loan is to increase the proportion of deposits to reserve Then if a panic seizes the public and even the banks of the interior which deposit in central cities the lawful reserves are drawn down and the banks cannot lend to needy borrowers How then can it help the banks in such a crisis to be permitted to issue their own notes This can help only in so far as putting out their own notes in a case of a run on the bank will save their lawful reserves It is not so much a scarcity of money when hoarding is going on as it is directly the amount of reserves and their protection which is of primary importance Consequently one would suppose the Aldrich Bill would have provided notesas when the Bank Act is suspended in Englandwhich could go into bank reserves and thus increase the ability of the bank to lend No such thing is done On the contrary the banks are allowed only to increase their 94NOTES 95 own note liability and more than this only at a charge of 6 per cent increased by usual costs for bonds etc to 7 or 8 per cent Now wherein does this provision assist the banks in the least to hold up the business world by loans In the crisis they are already estopped from lending because reserves have gone down and to a merchant begging for loans to save him from failure thev say we can give you a loan and credit you with a deposit of that amountprovided the clearinghouse committee will cover your checks as they come in with clearinghouse certificates based on our commercial assetsand the checks will pay your obligations at any bank in the city or under the Aldrich Bill if then a law we could give you a loan and hand you our bank notes for itpro vided you wait until we take out 133 per cent of the amount of your loan from our lawful reserves send out and buy some speci fied municipal county or state securities or railway bonds send them to the subtreasury telegraph for authority to issue notes get them printed in Washington have them sent back and signed and then charge you about 7 or 8 per cent for their cost independently of the rate of interest for the loan What under heavens could induce the borrower or the bank to choose the latter method If the bank dare take away any of its precious reserves then instead of buying securities on which only 75 per cent of their value in notes can be issued why not keep the reserves and make loans to four times the amount proposed to be used in buying bonds If ioo in vested in bonds will allow an issue of only 75 in notes to cover a loan then ioo left in the reserve would cover loans to the amount of 400 It is evident at once that the Aldrich scheme would only cripple the bank in time of stress and oblige the borrower to pay enormously for his salvation Moreover the plan seems to be based on the stupidity of sup posing that a borrower in need cannot pay his debts by a certified check but only by bank notes If a bank never issued a note under the Aldrich Bill it could help business men to at least five times as much in loans by keeping its reserves lending creating the usual deposit account and giving the borrower the right to draw on demand on that account To issue more bank notes would not increase its reserves and a banks ability to lend is in no way touched by the right to increasenot its reservesbut its liabilities The Aldrich Bill is another of the curiosities of our currency legislation96 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY There is the possibility of giving a loan by granting to the bor rower a claim on the bank either in the form of a deposit account on which he can draw checks or in the form of the banks own notes Both are a demand liability and the discount or profit to the bank is the same whichever form is used Therefore to tax one form 7 or 8 per cent will work merely to cause the other form to be used or in other words the notes of the Aldrich Bill by its own provisions are made practically nonusable Hence in a crisis the bill would be no help whatever and banks would be forced just as now to resort to clearinghouse certificates For tunately those certificates are still left as a nmeans to be resorted to in the next crisis In a condition of great stress moreover how are the three gentlemen in Washington to know whether it is wise to allow a Chicago bank to make a loan and give the borrower its own notes First of all they ought to pass upon the collateral offered or upon the condition of the borrowers own businessas is done by a clear inghouse committee with great effectiveness when certificates are issued Such a suggestion implies a quality of naivete in Congress which would grace a child of six but disgrace a man of sixty Either the government should supervise all loans or else it should keep out of the banking business altogether Again if the right to issue these emergency notes is confined to banks already having outstanding notes secured by United States bonds to an amount of not less than 50 per cent of their capital stock it should be noted that large banks in New York and else wherewhich notoriously have not issued any notes to speak of would for very definite reasons other than those mentioned above be inhibited from resorting to any issues under the Aldrich Bill In short a more clumsily devised schemeor one devised perhaps how not to do anythingcould hardly be conceived of In favor of the bill it should in fairness be said that it wipes out the restriction on the retirement of bank notes fixed by the act of March 4 1907 at 9ooooo0 per month That at least is a step ahead Such elasticity as comes from the ability to contract notes when no longer needed is obtained by the measure but that which comes from expansion is wholly absent Any issues of notes based on bonds are less profitable to a bank at the time when most needed by the public and more profitable at a time when least needed As to this admitted principle the Senate leaders are seemingly indif ferentNOTES 97 Also so far as the puttingout of bank notes would meet a run for cash the bill is to be commended but the process of providing a currency based on securities practically removes this advantage from consideration because the run would be over and the bank closed before these emergency notes could be obtained J LAURENCE LAUGHLIN THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO

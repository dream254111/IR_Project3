SCANDINAVIAN SHIPPING From ancient times the Scandinavian peoples have been in a prominent degree engaged in shipping In that way they intrc duced themselves for the first time into the history of Western Europe in a rather violent manner by the viking expeditions while the Norwegians or Norwegian colonists discovered Ice land Greenland and even the North American continent nearly five centuries before the discoveries of Columbus And in our day the Scandinavian flags covering a seafaring trade far beyond what might be expected from the small population of these coun tries wave in every part of the world The first viking expedition on record occurred in the year 93 small numbers of those seafarers arriving from the west of Norway at northern parts of the British Isles Some authors set the first expedition in the year 787 when three vessels prob ably Danish are said to have made an assault upon the Dorset coast in the south of England but this seems to have been at a later date During about two hundred years crowds of vikings harried the shores of western Europe particularly the British Isles and France From Denmark and the southern parts of Norway they genelrally proceeded along the coasts of Germany and through the Channel while the expeditions from western Norway sailed G STORM Kritiske Bidrag til Vikingetidens Historie Kristiania 1878 Voi I No 2330 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMIY to Scotland and round its north coast to the west of England and to Ireland The Swedish expeditions on the other hand were for the most part confined to the Baltic Apart from these commonly frequented regions the Scandinavian seafarers of those ages sometimes also sailed down the Mediterranean even as far as Constantinople The Swedes too came to that great met ropolis of the Byzantine empire but by quite another way namely from Russia down the river Dnieper and the Black Sea They even sailed down the Volga into the Caspian Sea where they plundered the Persian coasts Aserbeidjan In a northwestern direction the Norwegians reached as we have already mentioned the coasts of North America The introduction of Christianity about IOOO A D gradu ally put an end to the viking expeditions in their old form But in each of the three Scandinavian kingdoms the naval force con tinued to be the most essential part of their military strength Thus the Norwegian king Haakon Haakonsen who lived in the first half of the thirteenth century possessed a strong royal fleet consisting of 4050 large vessels besides some hundreds of leding vessels to be levied in case of war The royal fleet was kept up under his successors until the beginning of the fourteenth century but after the peace of Copenhagen 1309 which put an end to a long period of war between Norway and Denmark it was neglected and fell into decay The formation of the Hanseatic League I24I led to com mercial and political relations which in course of time exercised a pernicious influence on the trade and shipping not only of Norway but also of the two other Scandinavian kingdoms Several circumstances contributed to make the commercial supremacy of the Hansa felt most severely in Norway The country was exhausted in consequence of the constant civil and other wars The nobility was weakened There was no class of merchants the small towns which existed besides Bergen being chiefly inhabited by poor artisans fishermen and the like Thus there was nothing to oppose the capitalistic influence of the wealthy and extremely well organized Hansa This disadDEVELOPMENT OF SCaNDIN VIA4N SHIPPING 331 vantageous position was in the middle of the fourteenth century greatly aggravated by the frightful pestilence called the black death which perhaps in no country did more ravage than in Norway where it is estimated according to the best sources about onethird of the inhabitants were swept away while contempor ary chronologists put the loss at twothirds At all events this was a most formidable blow for very thinly populated Norway which for a long time was entirely paralyzed by its effects No wonder that under sucn circumstances the powerful Hanseatic League could establish a supremacy or rather a monopoly over the trade and shipping of Norway and that they obtained partly by negotiating partly by usurping privileges which rendered it still mnore difficult for the citizens to take an active part in the commerce In the principal town Bergen the Hanseatic traders founded a mighty colony a state in the state which entirely controlled the trade In the course of the i 6th century and particularly after I 5 50 the Norwegians however began to emancipate themselves from this commercial yoke In the meantime another foreign nation the Hollanders had commenced trading with Norwaya com merce which can be traced back to the middle of the fifteenth cen turyand they contrived after some lapse of time to supersede the Hanseatic traders Their commerce was however of a dif ferent and not so exclusive a character The Hollanders brought about an increasing and very important shipment of timber chiefly from the southern part of Norway the amount of which has been computed at only 2428 lasts in 1528 but at I4385 lasts about i 560 and 44892 lasts in the first decades of the seventeenth cen tury3 Both the rural districts and the towns derived advantage from this commerce and many of our towns date their first begin nings as loading places for timber from that period I F E SARS  Folkemoengdens Bevoegelse i Norge I3I7 Aarhundrede Historisk Tidskrift ii p 28 I et seq 2 A measure

century the export of timber from Nor way was very large By far the greater part of it went to Holland which in those times not only consumed large quantities for con struction of buildings in its own prosperous towns but also formed a staplemarket where the foreign timber was sawn up into boards and deals for reexportation to other countries such as France Spain and the like A good deal of timber was also exported from Norway to England direct and in the years sub sequent to the great fire of London in i666 it was a saying that the Norwegians warmed themselves very well at that fire In the earlier period of the Dutch timber trade the Holland ers fetched the timber in their own ships trading with the peas ants on very cheap terms and leaving scarcely any profit either for the merchants or for the shipping trade of Norway This state of things however gradually changed Legislative meas ures combined with the natural development of the trade particularly owing to the thinning of the forests situated along the coasts and to the necessity of floating the timber from the interiorcontributed more and more to draw the export to the towns particularly since I662 and at the samne time the Nor wegians began to take a more active part in the shipping of the timber The celebrated English Navigation act of Cromwell I65I was beneficial to the Norwegian shipping by driving the Holland ers out of the carrying trade between Norway and Great Britain In those days when the mercantile marine of Holland stood at the height of its glory surpassing by far even the tonnage of all other European nations together Great Britain included their vessels were to a large extent manned by Scandinavian sailors particularly Norwegians with whom the Hollanders had very close connections Yet many Norwegians were also hired as sailors on British ships The growth of Norways own mercantile marine during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries may be illustrated by some statistical facts I L DAA Nordrnands Udvandringer til Holland og EnglandDE VEL OPMENT OF SCANDINA V4AN SHIPPING 333 According to a report drawn up by the Swedish ambassador in Copenhagen Mr Durell Norway possessed in i650 only 5o vessels measuring above 88 lastsie about 200 tons At the end of the same century this number seems to have nearly doubled itself In the subsequent twenty years the commercial marine suffered heavy losses owing to warfare a large part of the vessels being captured by the Swedes After the reestablish ment of peace in I 720 there was a slow progress and the tonnage had in I750 perhaps again advanced to the same level as in I700 An account for the year I748 gives 94 vessels of I00 lasts or more the total number of smaller or larger vessels being 568 measuring 25000 to 26ooo lasts or about 6oooo tons This number does not seem to have undergone any material change during the next thirty years There exist records from I767 I777 and I778 which vary from 594 to 5i9 vessels and 25394 to 24704 lasts But from that time there was a large increase the last quarter of the eighteenth century being a very prosperous period for the trade and shipping of Norway During the American war of Independence and the wars succeeding the French revolution the neutral vessels derived great advantage from the high rate of freights prevailing at the time Commerce and shipping flourished and the tonnage had already in I792 increased to 455II lasts and in i8o6 even to 74824 lasts or nearly i8oooo register tons It is true that this large increase has been partially attributed to the circumstance that some foreign vessels were registered in Norway for obtaining the advantage to be derived by sailing under a neutral flag but even if we admit that this may have had some little influence on the figures there can be no doubt but that the chief part of the great progress which appears from these statistics was real This period which is also characterised by important liberal reforms in the commercial policy was the most prosperous which Norway had hitherto had The trade increased and assumed more and more an active character while even so late as I770 the export from Drammen then the largest shipping place for  A SCHIWEIGAARD Norges Statistik Kristiania I840 P I27I29334 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY timber was chiefly carried on in Dutch vessels The progress culminated in the years 1804 i8o6 when large fortunes were made in most of the Norwegian towns But the great profits led as is usually the case to overspeculation and was suddenly turned into deep distress by the outbreak of war with England in I 807 The war lasted until I 8 I 4 mitigated in the years I 8 I o 18I2 to some extent by the English license system by which Norwegian vessels were permitted to carry cargoes into British ports This licensed commerce brought however no lasting advantage though Norwegian products particularly timber were sold at very high prices owing to the closing of the Baltic ports Thus it is not surprising that the tonnage of the mercantile marine of Norway fell from 74824 lasts in I8o6 to 53734 lasts in I809 and it is rather astonishing that in I8I4 it reached so much as 69092 lasts ie about i65ooo tons With the restoration of peace and the reacquirement of the political independence of Norway in I814 begins a new era of the Norwegian shipping but before proceeding to the considera tion of the later development I will now give a brief sketch of the history of the Swedish and Danish shipping in earlier times The seafaring trade of Sweden was originally mostly con fined to the Baltic its present west coast belonged then partly to Denmark and partly to Norway and there existed on that side only one Swedish port  Lod6se in the neighbourhood of the present city of Gothenburg A very important seaport in the eleventh and following centuries was Wisby on the Isle of Gotland once the most celebrated seaport in the Baltic with a very extensive trade and shipping chiefly in Russian produce The principal staple place for the Swedish products was Stockholm the commerce of which was in the hands of Han seatic traders Yet the power of the Hanseatic League of which Wisby formed a link was not so overwhelming as in Norway In order to emancipate the Swedish trade from the Hansa king I Amongst other sources I may here particularly quote

twelfth century had carried on a very brisk trade in all the Baltic ports The chief article of export was timber while salt was a very prominent article of import into Sweden As a curious incident from those times it may be mentioned that the Swedes in the beginning of I 566 captured no less than two hundred salt laden vessels outside Falsterbo in Skaane although they were convoyed by 36 Danish vessels It is a well known fact that the shipping trade of the middle ages and even to the end of the eighteenth century was chiefly carried on in fleets consisting of a large number of vessels The number of Dutch vessels sailing in the Baltic is given at 5oo to 6oo in the sixteenth century and at I000 in the begin ning of the seventeenth while in I640 about i6oo Dutch vessels passed the Sound The mercantile marine of Sweden is said to have consisted in i559 of no more than 62 vessels measuring about 6ooo tons in all and it had been still less in the preceding years2 During the next turbulent period the marine fell into such a state of decay that for instance Stockholm which owned i8 vessels in i559 did not possess a single one in I6I4 Under the reign of Gus tavus Adolphus and probably during the greater part of the I7th century the shipping trade of Sweden was on the increase not withstanding the manifold hindrances laid by the Danes against Swedish vessels passing the Sound and also by the Dutch who with no less jealousy opposed the development of the Swedish shipping The influence of the Dutch which also in Sweden had received a heavy blow by the English navigation law was still prevalent in the Baltic during the first two decades of the i8th century but from that time they were more and more surpassed by the English For the sake of promoting the trade and navigation of the Swedish capital very heavy restrictions had been laid on the MOLLER Sdkrigshistorie Kristiania I863 2AGARDH AND LJUNGBERG Statsdkonomnisk Statistik iv p 334336 JOURNAL OF

ports in our time the seat of a most important commerce and naviga tionthemselves to possess any vessel trading with foreign countries This unnatural restraint was abolished in I765 In the middle of the seventeenth century the Swedes made several endeavors to promote an oversea trade Thus in I63I a colony was formed in North America by Swedish settlers who took possession of a tract of land situated on the Delaware river2 and in I649 an African company was started intending to trade with the coast of Guinea Both these attempts were however after the lapse of a few years frustrated by attacks of the Dutch and the English who in the years i650 i653 seized 23 Swedish vessels seven of which belonged to the African company In the next century there existed a Swedish East Indian company created in I73I and lasting until 18I3 but which seems never to have gained much importance About the same was the case with the trade with the West Indies colony St Barthelemy acquired by Sweden in connection with a commercial treaty with France in 1784 The number of vessels belonging to Sweden in the years suc ceeding the death of Charles XII I7I8 is variously indicated but the most credible figure seems to be that of 209 vessels of which only I9 were of I00 lasts or more3 In I724 a navigation law after the English model product  plakatet  was intro duced and it is said that the number of vessels increased very much in consequence so that in I7274 it already reached 480 The first reliable account of the number and tonnage of vessels seems however to be that of I795 given in the official statistical tables In that year the stapelstader i e privileged cities possessed 721 vessels measuring 46oo5 lasts or about 82800 tons The number of vessels seems on the whole to have been I

different vicissitudes of the eighteenth century As with the Norwegian and the Danish shipping the progress was probably greatest in the last quarter of the century although Sweden perhaps did not derive quite so much advan tage from the favorable conditions of that period as the two other Scandinavian countries On the other hand we find that the mercantile marine of Sweden continued to increase without any serious interruption until I8I 5 when the tonnage of the  stapel sttder was as much as 95600 tons and the total tonnage including other towns and shipowning places in the rural districts probably exceeded I 5oooo tons The shipping of Denmark seems to have been in some periods of its ancient history perhaps more prominent than either of the two sister kingdoms At the time of Canute the Great IOI5 I 03 5 the Danish rule extended from England in the west even to the eastern part of Prussia thus commanding both the North Sea and the Baltic and in a similar way although on a more limited scale Waldemar the Great and his successors in the last part of the twelfth and in the first decades of the thirteenth century ruled over great parts of the Baltic coasts of Germany and extended their sway as far as Esthland But at other periods Denmark exhibits the same sad spec tacle of civil wars and ruinous decay as the two other Scandina vian kingdoms particularly Norway have done at times The commercial and political influence of the Hanseatic League was very great in the thirteenth and subsequent centu ries They were first attracted to Denmark by the rich herring fisheries on the coasts of Skaane then a Danish province As in Norway the citizens in the towns of Denmark were during the middle ages quite unable to hold their own against the Germans During the reign of Waldemar Atterdag after the devastation by the pestilence Denmark was several times engaged in bloody wars with the Hansa and repeatedly invaded by the Germans On one occasion 77 different declarations of war from as many Hanseatic cities were simultaneously delivered338 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY to the king who was at last compelled to leave his kingdom for four years and accept a humiliating peace 1369 1370 which afforded the Hanseatic traders great privileges But the Danes emancipated themselves more and more particularly after the beginning of the sixteenth century when Copenhagen founded under Waldemar the Great by the celebrated bishop Absalon rose to be an important commercial and maritime city After the Hansa the Dutch and the English gained influ ence over the Danish trade without however creating such a supremacy as the Germans had attained The collecting by the Danish kings of the Sound dues which were levied on all vessels making the passage to or from the Baltic of course gave much displeasure to the foreign traders and occasionally to serious conflicts This duty which is stated to have existed already in the thirteenth century was for fiscal reasons considerably raised during the reign of Chris tian the Fourth i 88 I648 but he was compelled by the Swedes jointly with the Dutch to reduce it materially with the result that the tax instead of 528000 rigsdollars did not pro duce more than 8oooo In the year I oo it is said to have been no more than between 3000 and 4000 florins With the growing Baltic trade the revenue was however in course of time very much increased and amounted during the last four years pre vious to its abolition in I857 to about 3864ooo kroner or a little more than one million of dollars yearly The amount to be paid to Denmark for the repeal of this tax was stipulated at 35 millions of kroner distributed proportionally among the dif ferent maritime powers After the example of England and Holland the kings of Denmark made several endeavors to establish trade between Denmark and the East and the West Indies the first attempts in this direction dating from i6i8 Of these connections the trade with the Danish West Indian colonies commencing in I67I after the occupation of the island of St Thomas and St Jan was at certain periods rather important which may be seen from the fact that in 176I the number of vessels cleared fromDEVELOPMEIVT OF SCANDINA VIAN SHIPPING 339 Denmark for the West Indies was no less than 52 During the years I 760  I 770 there arrived at Copenhagen annually 20 to 30 vessels measuring in the aggregate about 4000 tons charged with sugar from St Croix And in I 782 there were delivered 246 ships passports for Danish and Norwegian vessels engaged in the West Indian trade After I783 however this trade declined and was in I807 entirely stopped by the outbreak of the war with England During the first twenty years of the eighteenth century the mer cantile marine of Denmark suffered severe losses by Swedish priva teers and it decreased during that period so much that notwith standing the progress which later took place it hardly recovered its former height until the middle of the century In I 748 Denmark proper possessed 793 vessels measuring nearly 40000 tons2 From that time begins an upward movement which in Denmark as in Norway was most pronounced in the year I776 i8o6 during which period the tonnage increased to nearly goooo tons includ ing vessels under 20 tons3 But the flourishing condition of those years was suddenly interrupted in I 807 when began a disastrous period of which we have already spoken in connection with the history of Norwegian shipping The tonnage of the mercantile marine of Denmark at the end of I8I4 may be estimated at between 70000 and 80000 tons4 Taking a broad view over the whole period extending from the viking age to I8I4 the comparison of the three Scandinav ian nations in regard to the relative importance of their shipping gives the following results In the earliest part of the period the Danes seem as a rule to have possessed a larger number of vessels and a greater mari time strength than either the Norwegians or the Swedes It ought however to be remembered that the territory of Den I FALBE HANSEN AND W SCHARLING Danmarks Statistik iii 2 Ibid 3 Ibid p 49I with addition of 20 per cent for

ECONOMIY mark was larger then than now This superiority was on the whole maintained in most of the following centuries except certain periods when the Norwegians were more prominent From the thirteenth to the sixteenth century there was as mentioned before a general decline along the whole line The rising export of timber helped forward the Norwegian ship ing considerably and in the latter part of the seventeenth century Norway possessed a somewhat larger tannage than Denmark and either of these countries a much larger tonnage than Sweden which in that respect seems to have been very inferior2 In the middle of the eighteenth century the shipping of Norway was represented by nearly 6oooo tons and that of Den mark by about 40000 tons The tonnage of Sweden had in the meantime considerably increased In I 8 I 5 Norway owned about I 70000 tons and Sweden somewhat more than I 5oooo while the mercantile marine of Denmark probably did not reach more than half that ie 70000 to 8oooo tons We will now consider the new era inaugurated in I8I4 and for which we have the advantage of basing our studies upon reliable and on the whole complete statistical facts the lack of which has been often felt in the preparation of the forgoing pages There are two events which more than anything else have exercised a marked influence on the development of shipping in our century namely first the repeal of the English naviga tion laws and secondly the introduction of steam vessels The first event took place in the year I849 the bill in question being approved by the queen on June 26th of that year The application of steam in the seafaring trade has been introduced gradually and it is therefore very difficult to indicate any definite year from I HOLM DanmarkNVorges indre Histoie i66o  I720 Kjobenhavn i886 pp 460  46I 2 See above p 335DEVELOPMEVT OF SCADINA VIAN SHIPPING 34I which the era of steam is to be reckoned On the whole however it may be said that steam vessels gained preponder ance over sailing vessels after the year I879 or thereabout considering the effective carrying power of both in the naviga tion of all countries Particularly for the trades in which the Scandinavian vessels were mostly employed the last named year may be considered as the turning point since which thecompetition of steam has been most seriously felt We have therefore found it convenient to divide the interval between I8I4 and the present tiine into three periods the first from 18i5 to i85o the second from i85o to i88o and the third from i88o to the present time During the first ten years after I 8 I 4 there was a general decline of the mercantile marine of most of the European countries The amount of tonnage which during the great French wars had been required for conveying merchandise under the vicissitudes of the war and the unsafe conditions of sea voyages in general now proved after the reestablishment of peace too large in proportion to the demand and this so much the more as the commerce in those years was almost univer sally in a depressed state A part of the tonnage had besides been employed in transport for war purposes The Norwegian shipping was likewise affected by this general decline and each year between I8I6 and I826 showed a general diminution of the tonnage from 7 I 092 lasts in the beginning of I 8 I 6 to 542I3 lasts at the end of I825 corresponding to about I75700 and I28200 register tons respectively or a diminution of more than one fourth In about the same proportion the mercantile marines of Sweden Denmark and Prussia diminished in those years while the tonnage of Great Britain did not decrease more than oneseventh and that of the United States was even a little larger in I826 than i8i6 x If these figures are compared with those communicated by the author in Statisti que Internationale iii p 5I there will be found some d is crepancies arising from the fact that vessels built before I8I9 had so long as they existed the benefit of a reduction of one  fifth in their tonnage a circumstance which has been hitherto neglected in the above mentioned international statistics342 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY A special adverse circumstance for the Norwegian shipping in those years was the bad state of the timber trade The exorbitant duties imposed in England in the years I809 1813 on foreign timber was felt very heavily particularly in Norway owing to the small dimensions of the timber while the British colonies in America were greatly favored The timber export from the southern ports of Norway to Great Britain fell from the rather high level it had reached in the year I805 namely I4776I lasts to 69448 lasts in I8I9 a reduction which of course made a great deal of tonnage superfluous The timber export to Denmark also diminished considerably after 1814 while on the other hand the export to France increased The improvement in the timber trade and in the state of the freight market which took place in 1823 and the two following very prosperous years finally stopped the decrease of Norwegian shipping and gave rise to an upward movement which begin ning in I826 has continued ever since up to the present time in favorable as in unfavorable years excepting only 1879 and I885  I887 In 1826 and succeeding years several reciprocity treaties were concluded with foreign countries whereby facilities were obtained for the trading of Norwegian vessels Of great importance for the development of the Norwegian shipping was the placing of Norwegian and Swedish vessels trading between Sweden and foreign countries on the same footing During the first ten years of the union Norwegian vessels were not permitted to carry freights between Sweden and foreign countries and a corresponding rule hindered Swedish vessels in Norwegian ports But these restrictions were abolished by a provisory decree of May 24 I825 confirmed by a law con concerning the commerce and navigation between the two countries of August 4 I 827 The immediate result of this liberal policy was a great expansion of the Norwegian shipping  The duty was in the case of deals 3 inches thick and i6 to 2I feet long raised

lasts in I825 while the corresponding figure for I8I9 was as low as 4300 lasts The English navigation laws and similar laws in other counikries made no distinction between Swedish and Norwegian vessels and both were thus permitted to carry goods from either of the two countries to foreign countries Although Swedish vessels began to take part in the trade between Norway and some of the foreign countries for instance in the timber export to Denmark and in homeward freights with corn and with salt it was the Norwegians who derived the greatest advantage as they were able to sail with profit on cheaper terms than the Swedes a circumstance which made their competition very much felt particularly in the timber trade between Sweden and western Europe The first Norwegian vessels which opened this trade went to Gothenburg the principal seaport on the west coast of Sweden Later some pioneers sailed to the Bothnian ports which have since grown up to be most important places for the timber export from Sweden The manner in which the Norwegian vessels generally proceeded in this trade was to make first a voyage from Norway to England or Holland etc from thence sail in ballast or occasionally with coal to the Baltic and then make two voyages between the Bothnian ports and western Europe and finally return in ballast or with a cargo of coal to Norway Compared with the Swedish ports on the Baltic the Norwegian ports offered the great advantage that they were open for navigation even in March sometimes even earlier while the Bothnian ports generally were shut up by the ice until the middle of May Thus the Norwegian vessels could make one voyage from Norway to western Europe and back again before the vessels belonging to the Bothnian ports could begin the navigation of the year In our times the steam boats break up the ice at an earlier date The following statistics show the development of the propor tions in which Norwegian Swedish and other foreign vessels took

per cent in I849 the percentage of the Norwegian vessels in the shipping trade of Sweden rose from II per cent in I827 to 34 per cent in I849 in I8I9 it was only 4 per cent The pro portion of the Swedish vessels was from I823 to I849 about 45 per cent in Sweden and only 3 per cent in Norway showing no material change during that period The percentage of foreign ships including Swedish fell in Norway from 30 per cent in I827 to 25 per cent in I849 while in Sweden that of the foreign ships except Norwegian fell from 39 to 2I per cent It was however not only in the navigation of Norway and Sweden that the Norwegian shipping during that period worked itself up The expansive tendency which has since been so conspicuous in the Norwegian shipping already proved then rather strong and even more vigorous outside than in Sweden Thus whereas in I837 the Norwegian carrying trade amounted to 33407 commercial lasts from Sweden and I6572 commercial lasts from other foreign countries the corresponding figures for the year 1849 were 58944 and 67405 lasts respectively That is to say the Norwegian carrying trade nearly doubled itself in the Swedish ports but more than quadrupled itself in the other foreign ports The countries which next after Sweden were of I The Norwegian last was equal to about 2 I register tons but it was 26 register tons for Norwegian vessels built before I8I9

freighted from the Mediterranean and some from the United States and other American countries The tonnage of the mercantile marine of Norway at the beginning of I83I is in the international shipping statistics stated at 134057 tons but with the addition of all tonnage which ought to be included for the comparison with the figures for i85o and later years 2 the total will be about i65ooo tons The corresponding tonnage was in I850 288600 tons showing a progress during the years I83I I850 of 75 per cent or nearly 3 per cent annually This is almost exactly the same rate of increase as that calculated for the maritime countries in general but if we do not reckon the United States where the increase during that period was exceptionally greatalmost 200 per cent and even more than that when we reckon the effective tonnagewe find that the average progress was no more than 27 per cent annually It has already been mentioned that in the first ten years after i8iS both the Swedish and the Danish mercantile marines decreased almost in the same proportion as the Norwegian and others After I826 the development of the mercantile marine of Sweden was somewhat irregular periods of progress alter nating with periods of decline Thus there was an increase of tonnage betwen I826 and I832 then a decrease until 1837 then again six years of increase four years of decrease and lastly four years with considerable increase until i85o On the whole between I83I and i850 there was an augmentation from I30 357 to I95I38 tons or about 50 per cent while the average increase in the above mentioned maritime countries was about 75 per cent and with the exception of the United States about 66 per cent Comparing the Swedish and the Norwegian shipping in this period we find that the Norwegians by far surpassed the Swedes in all ports of northern and western Europe In the Medi Vol ii table No 7 2See above p 34I note I346 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY terranean on the other hand the Swedish tonnage was larger except in some of the later years of the period In the trans atlantic navigation the Swedes employed a rather considerable tonnage principally trading to the United States to which there was a very large export of iron and to the Brazils Still in the last years of this period the Norwegian vessels trading to the United States equalled the Swedish The tonnage belongingto Denmark exclusive of Schleswig Holstein increased in the years i830i850 from 6oooo to 83 ooo tons This increase representing about 38 per cent was as it will be seen much less than that of the Swedish and the Nor wegian tonnage which were favored particularly the Nor wegian by the rapid increase of the timber export a circum stance of no particular interest to the Danish shipping The general commerce of Denmark which had no bulky article for export was between 1814 and I828 in a very depressed state but improved gradually afterwards especially in the later part of the period when Copenhagen began to take a more leading position The above mentioned increase of the Danish tonnage was as in Sweden interrupted by some years of decrease viz I834I836 and i845 The Danish shipping at that time was considerable in the English ports about as much as the Nor wegian and much more than the Swedish but it must be remenm bered that the Danish flag then covered vessels of Schleswig Holstein In the transatlantic trade the Danes were also fairly represented particularly in South America The next period 1850i879 was the most brilliant in the history of Norwegian shipping The relaxation and subsequent repeal of the English navigation laws induced the Norwegians to construct and purchase vessels of better quality than those hitherto employed which for the most part had been only in tended for the timber trade between northern and western Europe They began immediately to take advantage of the wider field now opened for their activity At the same time while the development of the export and import trade of NorDE VELOPRMENT OF SCANDINA VIAtN SHIPPING 347 way gave employment to an increasing tonnage this increase although in itself very considerable was put altogether in the shade by

the tonnage of Norwegian vessels employed in the Norwegian trade increased within that space of 30 years in the proportion of I 26 while that employed in the foreign car rying trade increased in the proportion of I 127 We will now briefly consider the development of the Nor wegian carrying trade in some countries which have been of most importance to it The rise in the Norwegian shipping in Swedish ports between the years I823 and I849 has already been stated above The outgoing carrying trade from this country increased in the fol lowing proportion the figures representing the tonnage of Nor wegian vessels cleared with cargoes from Sweden to other coun tries than Norway in commercial lasts of 2I register tons each I838 I844 I85II855 i86ii865 18711875 average average average 29299

the average being then 603700 tons After 1847 when this carrying trade rose to the exceptional height of 80982 lasts there was in the next years a great reduc tion owing to the state of the French market and from that time a gradual increase but not in the same proportion as before notwithstanding a great expansion in the Swedish export trade The percentage of Norwegian tonnage in the total tonnage cleared with cargoes from Sweden fell from 39 in 1847 to 30 in i856 From that year however the Norwegian tonnage employed in this trade increased on a very large scale for a long series of years until 1872 when it was nearly four times as large as in i856 The percentage in the general export trade of Sweden reached its highest point 435 per cent in I864 when owing to the DanishGerman war the German navigation in the Baltic ports was essentially reduced From i86i to 1872 the tonnage of Norwegian vessels cleared with cargoes from Sweden was larger than that of the Swedish vessels in i865 even to the con siderable amount of I96700 register tons their percentage being 424 against 28I under Swedish and 295 under other foreign flags In the timber trade especially that of the Bothnian ports north of Stockholm their percentage was still greater Since 1872 however there has been first a standstill and then particularly after 1883 an actual decrease in the Norwegian shipping in Sweden while the tonnage of Swedish and other nations has increased very considerably These variations are connected with quite characteristic phases in the development of Norwegian shipping in general The first effect on this shipping of the abolition of the English navigation laws was to induce the shipowners to employ their vessels in the new markets just opened For that reason they could not continue to develop with the same energy as before their trade in the old freight markets of which Sweden was the most important But when owing to the greater com petition those new markets no longer proved so profitable asDEVELOPMENT OF SCANDINAV IAN SHIPPING 349 formerly the reflux of the current came back to Sweden and that so much the more as the timber export from that country was rapidly increasing It will be remembered that the Nor wegian vessels were particularly adapted for the timber trade But in later years the steam vessels entered into a competition growing more and more keen also in this trade with sailing ves sels with the result that notwithstanding the expansion of the trade itself the export in Norwegian vessels which chiefly are sailing commenced to fall off In the Finnish and northern Russian ports the development of the Norwegian carrying trade has been somewhat different although in some respects similar the chief article of transport being the same as in Sweden viz timber The tonnage of Nor wegian vessels cleared from those ports averaged in the years I841I849 13000 to 14000 commerciallastsandfrom I850I853 12700 lasts In I854 and i855 this navigation was practically stopped by the Russian war In the years i86II865 the aver age rose to 45200 lasts and in I87II875 to 139800 lasts or 293600 register tons In these ports in contrast with the Swed ish the increase continued also during the following years and that in a very high degree the average for the quinquennium I876I880 being 412400 tons but the maximum point 497000 tons was reached in I877 since which year there has been on the whole a falling off Great Britain and Ireland have from an early period been of great importance for the Norwegian carrying trade which par ticularly in those countries has increased on a large scale The tonnage of Norwegian vessels entered into Great Britain with cargoes from other countries than Norway has increased in the following proportion in I837I838 the arrivals amounted to 13700 lasts annually chiefly or exclusively from Sweden in 1849 they numbered 30558 lasts in I850 49866 lasts in 185II855 they averaged 93600 lasts in i86ii865 2I0800 lasts in I8711875 478200 lasts or 1004000 tons in I876 I880 II97300 tons The outgoing trade increased also very much viz from only 1360 lasts in the years I837I838 to i8350 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY 400 lasts in I849 44700 lasts in I85II855 on the average 107600 lasts in I86II865 260000 lasts or 546ooo tons in I87II875 and 529200 tons in I876I880 Thus both inwards and outwards an extraordinarily large increase is to be observed until the years I87II875 and then a stagnation of which the cause was partly the general slackening of commerce during the latter part of the decade partly the increase of steam navigation In France already before I850 the carrying trade of the Norwegian vessels was rather large thus in the years I844I846 there arrived from foreign countries on an average 24800 lasts or nearly the same tonnage as in Great Britain but while the Norwegian trade in the last named country showed an extraor dinary development after I850 there was at the same time a decrease in the French trade Since i856 however this trade also has increased in a high degree numbering in the quinquen nial period I87II875 125500 lasts or about 263500 tons and in the next quinquennium even 440700 tons on the average In Holland and Belgium there has been about the same development of the Norwegian carrying trade although in a somewhat smaller proportion than in France the average for the years I876I880 being I84000 tons for Holland and i09000 tons for Belgium The carrying trade in the British colonies in North America deserves special mention This trade was first opened in i850 with a tonnage of 7400 lasts cleared for Eng land and other countries after having been kept about this level during the next quinquennial period averaging 8300 lasts there was a large expansion in the following years the average for the period I86II865 being 45300 lasts increasing to i09000 lasts or 229000 tons in the years I87II875 and 288ooo tons in the next quinquennial period Large as this increase was it has been greatly surpassed by the development of the carrying trade to the United States This trade was inconsiderable before the last years of the decade I86II870 The tonnage of Norwegian vessels entered with cargoes from foreign countries except Norway to theDEVELOPMENT OF SCANDINA VIAN SHIPPING 35 Atlantic ports of the United States averaged in the two quin quennial periods I85II855 and i86ii865 4900 and 6900 lasts respectively and the outgoing tonnage in the same periods 2960 and 13300 lasts But in the years I87II875 the aver age tonnage suddenly rose to 76350 lasts inwards and 170000 lasts outwards corresponding to about i6oooo and 357000 tons And these large numbers continued to increase rapidly in the following years the average for the period I876I880 being 207000 tons inwards and 853700 tons outwards The maxi mum was reached for the ingoing trade in i88o with 420600 tons for the outgoing trade in I879 with I066900 tons and for these trades together in i88o with an aggregate tonnage of 1398800 tons The general navigation of the United States during the decade I87ii88o nearly doubled principally owing to a large expansion of the export of wheat and other cereals petro leum and lumber For these articles Norwegian vessels were well suited and this circumstance partly explains the fact that the Norwegian shipping at the period took such a large share in the increase But there is another reason which is not without interest The Norwegian sailing vessels being by the competi tion of the steamers gradually driven out of the shorter Euro pean trades or rather finding there no more room for expan sion sought a compensation in the transatlantic trade chiefly that of United States We have now mentioned the most important branches of the Norwegian carrying trade in this period but apart from the countries already named several others were of more or less importance The principal articles of transport were first and foremost lumber and then cereals petroleum coal cotton and wool sugar and coffee ice etc thus as it will be seen principally bulky articles of which in the years I874I876 nearly a half of all freights was made by the transport of lumber As regards the increase of the Norwegian mercantile marine during this period we extract the following figures from the352 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY second volume of the

mercantile marine 685 578 and 511 per cent respectively During the eight years I850I857 the average progress was 8 per cent annually then followed five years with smaller progress the annual rate being however 26 per cent After those years came a new period of a great and continuous progress extending over thirteen years viz from I864 to I876 with an increase of 7 per cent annually From I877 however the progress was slow and in i88o the last year of the period there was for the first time since I825 a decrease We shall now give some information about the development of the Swedish and of the Danish shipping between I850 and i88o when the tonnage of the respective countries was as follows SWEDEN Tonnage of Tonnage of Total Tonnage Total Effective Sailng Vessels Steam Vessels in

SCANDINA VIAN SHIPPING 353 The progress of the mercantile marine was both in Sweden and in Denmark somewhat greater than the average mean prog ress calculated for all maritime countries together but less than in Norway the average rate of increase being 434 per cent in Sweden and 470 per cent in Denmark reckoned from the effect ive tonnage During the last decade of the period however the Swedish and the Danish marines increased faster than the Nor wegian their respective annual rates being 672 6og and 591 per cent The difference in the rates was exclusively due to the greater importance of the steam tonnage in Sweden and Den mark In fact the steam tonnage in each of the three Scandi navian countries increased in those years at about the same rate a very high rate viz between i6 and 17 per cent annually while the increase of the sailing tonnage was 438 per cent in Norway 347 per cent in Sweden and I9I per cent in Denmark Thus notwithstanding a comparatively high rate of increase in each class of vessels considered separately the whole result was less favorable for the Norwegian marine because it contained an overwhelming proportion of the less increasing sailing tonnage The mercantile marine of Sweden showed an exceptionally large increase in the six years I869I875 when it nearly doubled the effective tonnage being calculated at 343662 tons at the the beginning of I869 and at 683029 tons at the beginning of I875 In one year I873 Sweden increased its tonnage by I05 287 effective tons or more than 21 per cent and the next year witnessed a further increase of 79000 effective tons In the other years of the period I850 I878 the progress was however rather slight and in I879 there was as in Norway a decrease In Denmark we observe a fair increase of the tonnage in the years I850 i86o then a decrease until i865 and from that yea until the end of the period in most years a good increase par ticularly in the years I87I  I876 The last period extending from i88o to the present day has for the Norwegian shipping during the most part of it been a period of adversities struggles and slow progress354 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY The overwhelming competition of the steam vessels had never made itself so severely felt as since i88o and perhaps in no country so much as in Norway where the shipping until then had been almost entirely based on sailing vessels Particularly in the first half of the decade i88o I890 when the steam tonnage made rapid progress everywhere whereas the sailing tonnage almost invariably diminished all countries with comparatively small steam tonnage were greatly distanced by the countries where steam tonnage was already of importance From this general rule Norway made no exception although its steam tonnage increased considerably and its sailing tonnage practically was kept up to the same level as before Lately however the general rise of freights in i888 and in I889 has given a new and considerable impetus to the Norwegian shipping as will be seen from the following statement showing the Norwegian tonnage statistics since i88o and where for the sake of comparison are subjoined the corresponding figures for

355 in Sweden 104 per cent and in Denmark 350 per cent but considering that the progress during the last two years was exceptionally great it will perhaps be better to take the average rate in the decade i 88o  I 890 as a more nearly correct expression of the mean progress in our times and then the above stated aver ages must be reduced to i86 057 and 32I per cent respectively The corresponding rate for the mercantile marine in all coun tries of the world is calculated to 3o8 per cent As for Norway we shall have to go back so far as to the period before I830 in order to find a rate of progress lower than that which has occurred since i88o and the same may be said of Sweden if we consider periods consisting of ten years or more In the case of Denmark on the other hand the progress in the years I88o  I890 was surpassed only by that in the decades I870 i880 and I850 i86o The difference in this respect between Denmark and Norway is explained by the fact that the steam tonnage was in i880 45 per cent of the effective tonnage in Denmark but only I0 per cent in Norway where the progress of shipping has been suffering and is still laboring under the dead weight of a large tonnage of sailing vessels which it takes time to reduce to a proportion more adequate to the present condi tions of seafaring Still as it will be seen the steam tonnage of Norway has made rapid progress in later years and begins to tell in its mercantile marine being in I892 more than 32 per cent of its total effective tonnage It is chiefly Bergen which has contributed to this increase If in Sweden the progress of the mercantile marine of late years has been still less than in Norway notwithstanding a higher proportion of steam tonnage the cause may perhaps to a great extent be attributed to overspeculation in steam vessels in the years I870 I874 during which their tonnage was increased from 20720 to 90565 registei tons including the inland ports Many of the new steam vessels constructed or purchased were built of wood and gave bad economical results After that experience the interest for investing capital in steam tonnage died away and there was for some years even a356 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY decrease while in later years again there has been some prog ress On the other hand the sailing tonnage has on the whole diminished a little Turning now to the different branches of the Norwegian carrying trade we find that the retrograde movement observed already in the later part of the foregoing period in the trade with Sweden Finland and the northern parts of Russia has con tinued since i88o in a marked degree The tonnage of Nor wegian vessels freighted from Sweden to foreign countries amounting in i88o to 594000 tons and in I882 even to 7I5300 the highest amount ever reached has fallen off to 396ooo tons in I890 and the percentage of Norwegian vessels in the out going cargoes of Sweden has gone back from 2I5 per cent in i88o to I09 per cent ten years after while as we have stated above it was 42 to 43 per cent in the years I864 and I865 The steam tonnage employed in the Baltic timber trade chiefly under British Swedish and German flags has been continually on the increase whereas the Norwegians hitherto have not employed much steam tonnage in that trade In the Baltic trade of Russia and Finland the Norwegian shipping has diminished in a still larger proportion the tonnage of outgoing cargoes for foreign countries being in I890 only i668oo tons against 46I200 tons in i88o In the important timber trade from the Dominion of Canada there has been however some progress the Norwegian out going tonnage numbering 468I00 tons in I890 as against 35I600 tons in i88o and 288200 tons on the average in the foregoing quinquennium As to the shipping to the United States there has been on the whole a diminution in the Norwegian trade The competition of steamers has driven the Norwegian sailing vessels almost com pletely out of the corn trade from the Atlantic ports and greatly reduced their share in the petroleum trade On the other hand the tonnage employed in the export of timber from the gulf ports has increased while Norwegian steamers have found em ployment in different ways among others in the fruit trade fromDEVELOPMENT OF SCANDINA VIAN SHIPPING 357 West Indian and Central American ports to New York and other ports in the States On the whole however the outgoing Nor wegian tonnage has diminished as much as from 978200 tons in i88o to 585500 tons in I890 For this and other losses the Norwegian shipping has prin cipally sought compensation in outgoing freights from Great Britain particularly coal freights for Brazil Argentina and other distant countries while the greatly increased import to Argen tina has also given occupation to many timber carrying vessels freighted from Canada and the United States The amount of Norwegian tonnage employed in the outgoing carrying trade from Great Britain and Ireland has risen from an average of 529200 tons in the years I876I880 and 704000 tons in i88o to II76300 tons in I890 while the inward going trade to Brazil and Argentina has increased still more viz in the former coun try from 47200 tons in i88o to 258700 tons in I890 and in Argentina from i65oo tons in i88o to 434600 tons in I889 and 359200 tons in I890 Space forbids entering into more details but in concluding this section it will perhaps be of some interest to give account of the distribution of the Norwegian as well as of the Swedish and Danish shipping in the different parts of the world Information on this subject has been given for most of the sea faring nations in the fourth part of the international shipping statistics and it may in this respect particularly be referred to No III of the table annexed to the introduction to that volume showing the share of each nation in the navigation of each coun try in the year i888 It is true that the figures given in that table represent only the entries no distinction being made between those with cargoes and those in ballast But although the information is consequently incomplete yet it may be used as a rough approximation of the subject Beginning with the Scandinavian shipping in each of their own countries we find the Norwegian tonnage representing 63 per cent the Danish 5I4 per cent but the Swedish only 35 per cent of the total tonnage in Norway Denmark and Sweden358 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY respectively In the navigation of Norway the Danish counted 89 per cent and the Swedish 7I per cent while in the naviga tion of Sweden the Danish flag counted 207 per cent and the Norwegian ii5 per cent Yet the Danish vessels being for a very large part engaged in quite short voyages as in the cross ing of the Sound and the Norwegian vessels almost entirely in longer voyages the real proportion between the flags would stand otherwise if the length of voyages is taken into consider ation In the navigation of Denmark the Swedish flag repre sented I39 per cent the Norwegian only 49 per cent The total Scandinavian tonnage was thus in each of the Scandinavian countries represented as follows in Norway by 79 per cent in Sweden by 67 per cent and in Denmark by 70 per cent In the navigation of Russia the Danes take a somewhat more prominent position than the Norwegians and the Swedes particn larly in the Baltic trade Their percentage was 57 whereas that of the Norwegians and of the Swedes was 43 and 34 respect ively making a total of I34 percent In Finland their aggre gate percentage was I6 almost equally divided between each of these three nations About the same proportion is found as to Scandinavian navigation in Germany where the repartition however is somewhat different viz 63 per cent under the Danish flag 56 per cent under the Swedish and 4 per cent under the Norwegian flag under which however the longest voyages are made In western Europe the share taken by the Scandinavian flags is on the whole less considerable In England however they represent nearly io per cent of the tonnage of which 56 per cent falls upon the Norwegian flag alone which here takes the lead among all foreign flags In the Netherlands and in Bel gium the percentage of the Scandinavian vessels together is only 56 and 775 in France Portugal and Spain 66 55 and 4I per cent respectively In the Mediterranean countries their proportion is on the whole trifling with the exception of Spain and so is also the case in the most part of Africa Asia and Australia Still eachDEVELOPMENT OF SCANDINA VIAN SHIPPING 359 of these flags particularly the Norwegian is to be seen almost everywhere In the United States of America and in some other American countries as in Canada Argentina and Uruguay the Norwegian flag covers from 45 to 6 per cent of the navigation while the Swedish and the Danish in this continent seldom exceed one half per cent The following statement gives the totals and the percentages of the Scandinavian

circumstances which should be borne in mind The statistics forming the basis of the calculations are not complete in so far as they do not comprehend the navigation of all countries an observation which particularly applies to the nonEuropean Continents Then it must be observed that the importance of the shipping does not depend on the tonnage alone but on the character of the navigation which chiefly depends on the length of the voyages In that respect the Swedish and still more the Danish vessels are as we for some particular cases have already observed principally employed in short voyages the Norwegian vessels on the other hand to a great extent in the360 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY ocean trade For this reason the proportions calculated above for the different flags do not represent either in the navigation of Europe or in the total navigation of the World their real im portance In the case of the Norwegian and the Swedish ship ping there is however an excellent means of testing the bear ing of this circumstance as the amount of freights in each trade is officially stated The total amount of freights in I890 of the Swedish vessels in their carrying trade as well as in their trade between Sweden and foreign countries was 374 millions of kroner while the amount of freights earned by the Norwegian vessels calculated in the same manner was I097 millions This gives the proportion of I 29 whereas the figures of the table above give the proportion of I  I75 Still that table as well as the more detailed statistics of which it gives a summary is not with out interest when used properly In the absence of reliable statistics of the amount of freights earned under the different flags one of the best means of ascer taining their relative importance in the general shipping trade is to calculate their total effective carrying power each ton of steam vessels being computed at the usual rate of 3 to I We subjoin therefore in this connection the following

ping up to the present time we shall now before finishing glance at the principal causes that have influenced its develop ment Norway and the two other Scandinavian countries are in possession of several of the physical conditions favorable to an extensive navigation They have extensive coast lines and a multitude of good harbors particularly Norway where splendid harbors are to be found almost everywhere along the coast The country is in many parts so intersected by fjords and inlets that the sea is the most convenient and often the only practicable way of communication between the inhabitants The people therefore to a great extent live on the water to which the inhabitants are also attracted by the fisheries The climate too is favorable for seafaring trade which requires hardy men accustomed to rough weather The geographical situation between the Baltic and the North Sea in the neighborhood of great commercial centers ought also to be borne in mind A drawback for Sweden is the long and intensely cold winter which particularly in its northern harbors stops the navigation during a great part of the year while all the Norwegian and Danish harbors are practically speaking open throughout the whole year except in unusual cases There is however plenty of evidence to show that physical circumstances howsoever favorable are not in themselves able to promote shipping where the commercial conditions are wanting Norway itself affords one of the best proofs of this Its very extensive western and northern coasts where all those362 JOURNAL Of POLITICAL ECONOMY physical conditions are abundantly at hand are still very poor in shipping except Bergen and a few other places But it is a very different thing where the physical and the commercial con ditions both are in combination This is precisely the case with the Scandinavian countries which on the whole have had and still have an extensive export and import trade In this respect Norway and Sweden especially the latter have a great advan tage in their large export of timber and other bulky articles such as ice mineral ore iron etc which require a great space in proportion to their value The import too of these countries is rather considerable Denmark has not the advantage of a bulky export but this is compensated to a certain extent by an extensive trade which is carried on particularly by Copen hagen and is favored by the splendid situation of that port It may be objected that there are countries where both the physical and commercial conditions are abundantly at hand but which still do not possess any great mercantile marine or at least not so great as could be expected from their large mari time commerce The explanation of this fact is in most cases that the interests and inclinations of the inhabitants may turn in other directions rather than to the sea It may be and is often the case that agriculture industry and commerce are found more lucrative or at all events more attractive than the sailors hard and toilsome life In the case of Norway on the other hand it should be re membered that the country is comparatively little adapted for agriculture that also many of the other trades have hitherto yielded but a small remuneration and that the field for enterprise is on the whole rather limited No wonder that the Norwegians with preference turn to the sea where they have such a large field for their activity extending as it does over the whole world Thus as the nature of their country makes the Norwegians familiar with the sea they are also economically attracted to the seafaring trade And even socially the shipping has for them a great attractionDEVELOPMENT OF SCANDINA VIAN SHIPPING 363 The wider horizon the richer and more varied life abroad the wonders of art and industry contrasted with the monotony of life which often prevails in many small communities on the sea  coast  how all these must attract young lads grown up in those places who from their earliest childhood have played on the beach and on the water whenever they could sailing in boats or climbing up the rigging of the ships or listening to stories told by their seafaring elder brothers or relatives How can these young viking lads but long for the time when they too are permitted to cross the sea into the wide wide world  Under such circumstances it is not astonishing that in many places in Norway chiefly along its southern coast the great majority of the young men choose a seafaring life One of the causes which have favored the development of the Scandinavian shipping is the good supply of shipbuilding materials which the forests of Norway and Sweden have afforded In later years however when iron and steel are mostly used in the construction of ships the supply of wood is of less impor tance Sweden has iron of a very good quality but it is not so cheap as in England Norway must buy nearly all the iron and steel it uses  but gets it cheap because the homeward freight is low and there is no import duty on these materials The shipbuilding industry has formerly been of great impor tance particularly in Norway although it has never been suffi cient to meet the demand for tonnage The maximum was reached in I875 when 73564 tons almost exclusively sailing vessels were constructed During the years I873I879 i88o I885 and I886I890 the construction averaged 49000 21300 and I2900 tons yearly whereof in the two last named periods between 4000 and 5000 tons were steam vessels In Sweden and Denmark the construction of steam vessels has in later years been somewhat less than in Norway and that of sailing vessels very inconsiderable Norway is in most years a large buyer of tonnage from abroad During the quinquennial period I886I890 it bought on the average 78364 tons of sailing vessels and I6095 tons of364 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY steam vessels yearly including the tonnage of new vessels con structed on British and other wharfs for Norwegian account Formerly the vessels purchased from abroad were subject to an import duty amounting to 8 specie daler per last about 4 dollars per ton this duty was lessened in I85I and abolished in i857 In the same year the purchase of foreign vessels was made duty free in Sweden where however in i888 a duty of IO per cent ad valorem was imposed In Denmark there has been for a long series of years a duty of 3 per cent In Norway it is generally considered as a great advantage not to say a necessity for our shipping that there is a free admission of foreign built vessels The rapid development of our marine would have been impossible if we had been limited to our own shipbuilding industry There have been however among the vessels pur chased from abroad not a few secondclass ships which if they have yielded good profits when freights were high have on the other hand in many cases given bad results in ordinary years not to speak of the years of depression The purchases of Sweden and of Denmark have been on the whole inconsiderable The most important element in the navigation is however the manning of the ships and it is beyond doubt that the great progress which the shipping of Norway and also that of the two other Scandinavian countries has made was above all due to the character of their seamen In later years when steam navigation has taken the lead it would perhaps seem as if the profits earned by this trade were less dependent on the seamanship of the crew than on the con struction of the vessels and the managing of the shipowners business The conditions may so far have changed somewhat with the growing preponderance of steam But under all circumstances the physical intellectual and moral standard of the seamen combined with the skill of the constructors and the intelligence of the shipowners will continue to be the fundamental condition for a prosperous development of the shipping as far as depends on men A N KIR CHRISTIANIA NORWAY

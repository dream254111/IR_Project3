of socalled selec tion I considered as factors in progress from gener ation to generation in which the laws of natural selection and physical reproduction do not operate together I think it is extremely desirable that we discard the word  selection  in toto and give to each case a name which shall apply to it alone The cases of the preservation of indi viduals and groups by reason of their social en dowments do illustrate natural selection with physical reproductiQn so I propose  Social Se lection  10 for that But in the instances in which either physical heredity is not operative 12 or in which it is not the only means of transmission 11 we cannot secure clearness without new terms for these two cases I have suggested  Social Suppression  11 and  So cial Generalization 12 The phrase Imita tive Selection  is given in the table alternately for the latter 12 seeing that the discussions of the topic usually employ the term  Selection and use wrongly the Natural Selection  anal ogy Selection may be used also when there is no reference to raceprogress and so no danger of the misuse of the biological analogy since it then means presumably the 4conscious choice of psychology and of

developed certain  It may be well to add that this table is not in tended to be altogether exhaustive from the bfological standpoint For example Professor Minots Post Selection  and Romanes Physiological Selection  do not fall readily into the scheme Nor are the differ ent headings in all cases exclusive of one another eg Darwin really included both the cases I and II of Natural Selection under the single phrase and justly so seeing that they illstrate a single principle 773 convictions thereon I beg leave to state them Before proceeding to do this I wish to express my appreciation of the reasonableness of the condition of doubt in which Dr Wilder finds himself Formerly I employed the term Batrachia Later I became inclined to regard Amphibia as having superior claims principally because it has been used and insisted on by many careful writers I trust that my present views rest upon a better foundation In DrBaurs communication of July 20th his conclusion is summed up in the following words Three years later Latreille used the Latin names Reptilia and Amphibia for de Blainvilles classes Reptiles and Amphibiens and these names ought to be used However it appears to me that he has failed to tell us why they ought to be used that is he has not stated the principles which make it obligatory on us to use them He has only given us an excellent history of the case and his conclusion We have definite laws govern ing the formation and use of generic and specific names but the only law cited by Dr Baur which applies to appellatives of higher rank is that which deprives of binding authority all vernacular names even though they may seem to imply the Latin forms This rule which most naturalists will endorse materially clears the ground in the present case Cheloniens Ophidiens Batraciens and Amphibiens stand on the same footing as Schildkr6ten Schlangen Toads and Turtles It might be supposed that Dr Baur relies on the law of priority to sustain him since he is so careful and properly so to give the dates of proposal of each of the names employed but the fact that he rejects Range as a name for the frogs etc makes it evident that he demands something more Dr Gill says that we must be guided by the law of priority in the selection of names One thing is very certain and that is that we cannot rigidly enforce with respect to the ap pellatives of higher rank the same rules that apply to genera Common usage must and does determine much in the case of the former terms The law of priority and a desire to NOVEMB ER 19 18971774 SCIENCE preserve Linnseus names would probably impel us to overthrow the usurping title Elasmo branchii in favor of Linnseus quite appropriate word Nantes Linnseus apt Testacea has been crowded out of all authority by the upstart Mollusca which originally ruling over a petty section of heterogeneous elements now stands at the head of a vast subkingdom Linnseus beautiful name Zoophytes is now replaced by Coelenterata suggestive of famine The strict law of priority applied to the term Reptilia would result in restricting it to ordinal rank or in worse consequences Laurenti 1768 em ployed it to include Linnseus Amphibia minus the Nantes It then either became a synonym of Amphibia or restricted the latter term to the Nantes But the man who at this day attempts to oust Reptilia from its position in nomencla ture will shed his ink in vain Furthermore the contest for the headship of the class em bracing the frogs and salamanders lies between Amphibia and Batrachia No Ranae Ichthyoidea or Nudipellifera need apply A word now regarding the use of the word Amphibia Linnseus and some of his disciples included under it not only the reptiles and batrachians but also various fishes These being at length excluded the term was em ployed for nearly a hundred years by various writers of standing to embrace all the reptiles and ranine and salamandrine forms In 1825 it seems to have been used for the first time by Latreille to designate what are now commonly called the batrachians or amphibians This is the date given by Dr Baur and is most prob ably the correct one In 1804 Latreille recognized the fact that the frogs and salamanders form a natural group and he called this group the order Batrachii We can hardly suppose that this name will be rejected because of its masculine ending But if so the honor of giving the name to the group belongs to Gravenhorst who in 1807 called it Batrachia But the advocates of Amphibia re ject Gravenhorsts name because it was used for the group as an order Then must every group be rechristened whenever its rank is changed  I know of no rule of nomenclature requiring this nor does common usage demand it Most ichthyologists regard the Elasmo N S VOL VI No 151 branchii as a subclass of Pisces Must those who consider it a distinct class seek a new name  Whenever the word Mollusca was applied to the group of mollusks the name dated from that time even though the group may still have been looked upon as an order of Vermes In the words of Professor Cope Batrachians N A p 20 the rank assigned to such division is im material the idea of the division itself is every thing But even in case it were necessary to esti mate correctly the value of a group when its name is applied to it the term Batrachia may yet succeed in running the gauntlet In 1820 Merrem recognized in Linnseus Amphibia minus the Nantes two distinct classes These he named and adequately defined The one Pholidota corresponds to our Reptilia the other he called the Batrachia and it corresponds with the group now socalled What rule or practice of nomenclature was not complied with by Mer rem in this case This was five years before Latreille restricted the title Amphibia to the same class If I correctly understand Dr Baur he rejects Merrems name because the latter writer still considered his classes as holding such a relation to each other that they might be brought under the name Amphibia regarded perhaps some what in the sense of a superclass Is there any law against this  Such a law would have to be formulated somewhat thus A class name to be acceptable must originally have been ap plied to the group regarded as a class and the author must have entertained opinions now held as orthodox regarding the relationships of his class to other classes In conclusion I will say that from the evi dence now in it appears to be a very plain case in favor of the defendant Batrachia I should say that it dates as a name from Latrielle 1804 or from Gravenhorst i807 most certainly not later than Merrem 1820 Amphibia has been employed in so many senses that it leads to confusion It should be reserved for those who may now or hereafter hold there is some special relation between the reptiles and batrachians I am sorry to differ with my friends Dr Gill and Dr Baur 0 P HAY U S NATIONAL MUSEUM September 24 1897

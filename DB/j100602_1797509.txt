eclipses IIOn Sind BY CaPtain A BURNES E I C Communi cated by the Geographical Society of Bombay Read Febru ary 27 1837 MUCH has been said upon Sind and I have perused most of that which has been publisTled as well as written I purpose therefore to state concisely the result of my reading and observa tions I do not record my authorities and I leave others to find out the points on which I diSer from preceding writers It is however due to Mr Nathan Crow of the Bombay Civil Service to state that his  Account of the country of Sinde5 appears as far as I can judge to have been the text book of all succeeling writers It is a finished essay and though written so far back as the year 1800 remains to this day a model which I think will seldom lze surpassed It may then le askel what leads me to write on Sind I do so because we have had many and late opportunities of increasing our infortnation In me printed work too I have rather confinel myself to the river Inlus than the country through which it flows It must be borne in mind how ever by all who peruse this paper that it is one of results The country waterel by the Indus is called Sind Tllis is alsl the name given to that river itself by the inhabitants The designation is ancient since Arriant mentions Sinlomana To speak generally that country from the ocean to the confluence of the Panjab rivers with the Indus bears the name of Sind That is from the latitude of about 23 to 29 N and from 67 to 71 E longitule The banks of tlle InlusS however as high as Sengar svhicll is in abollt 31 North are sometimes called Sinl With out this allition the area of the country inclules about 100000 square miles On the South it has for its bounlaries the pro vince of Kachh and the Ocean On the East it has Rajwara or the country of the Rijputs as also the Daudputras On the Northit has the Panjab and Iachh Gandavah On the West lies  Sind in Hindi Sendhs is the lalld of the Sindhu or Infltls In the ancient Per sian and

30t  when it begins to throw off laranches Its Delta however commences below Thathah in the latitllde of 24 40t after which it enters the sea by elerren mouths anl presents a face of 125 British miles to the ocean The sources cf this great riser are unknosn It is eertain that it rises in the mountains of Himalaya near Thibet It is probable that the Shayuk from Karakorum anl the river of Ladakh from near the Lake MansarowariF are its principal feelers From Kashmir the Indus is separated by a snowy range It then receives the Aba Sin and passes on to Atak where it is joinel by the LAndai or river of Kaloul One of the sources of this tributary descends from Pamer and is nearly as remote as the principal branch From Atakto the sea the Indus is familiarly known by the name of  Sind or  Atak Mihran is a name only known to foreigners Atak signifies forbidden and it is sail to be so called because the Hindus are forbillen to cross it Below the Panjab risers it takes the name of  Sira elown to SehwEn and from thence to the sea that of  Lar These are two Beldchi worls for north and south The local names for diSerent parts of the Indus are warious Those of the branches in the Delta shall be afterwards enumerated The face of Sind is uninteresting Eastward of the Indus there is not a rising ground nor a stone in the country exceting the hillocks of Bhakar and Haiderabad It is flat anl covered rith bushes till it at last joins the desert of sandhills which separates Sind from India MYestward of the river as low lown as Sehwan the same flatness prevails to the base of the Beluchi anountains From that tolvn to the sea the land is rocky anl barren The Delta of the Indus loes not differ froIn that of oXcher risers It is rich but it is poorly cultisated Ten miles from the sea it is frequently an impervious thicket Higher up it is overrown with tamarisk shrubs which also thread into each other The rest presents a naked plain of hard cakeel clay AXIuch of the land that is adapted for agriculture is only used for pasture Much of it also lies neglected et the crop of rice is estensive ancl far exceeds the consumtion of the country It is the staple of Sind the inhabitants

narcotics There are but few trees in Sinl Sind owes its fertility entirely to the Indus and more particu larly to the annual or periodical swell of the river The return of the waters is regular they rise in March and subside in Se tember The melting of the snow in the Himalaya is the cause of this phenomenon The waters are courted by the inhabitants anl distributed by canals far away from the river The actual swell seldom estends half a mile on either bank The immediate banks of the Inlus are but partially cultivated The soil is saline and unfavouralule to tillage as is proved by all its spontaneous productions Without the Jndus the whole of Sind wouXl be come as perfect a desert as the country lying eastward of it Encrustations of salt and saltpetre are to be seen eserywhere The latter is exported Many of the shrubs yield alkalis which are used in manufactures With all these rlatural lisadvantages the revenue of the country in these days sometimes reaches forty lacs of rupees 400000 In the government of the dynasty that preceded the present it yielded eighty lacs 800000 The depreciation arises partly from political causes The treasure possessed by the rulers is considerablet In the strict sense of the word Sind cannot be considered rich possessing a resem blance to both Egypt and Bengal it has not the richness of either The crops however are reaped without labour the seel is scat terel after the inundation and the harvest is certain The history of Sind is clearer than most Asiatic Chronology the marked feature of the Indus running through it has contributed to preserve it Herodotus says that Darius Hystaspes sent an expedition to explore the Indus which sailed out of the riser Alexander the Great turneel this information to aecount He found

native Rajus recovered their ascendancy The successful tribe was the Sumrat which was settled in the confines of Makran at the Mohammedan invasion They did not long retain their power and were displaced by the Slmah another great and ancient na tive tribe which yet exists in the country They took the title of Jam The Raja of Kachh and the JErejah Rfijputs are de scendants from these Slmahs There are both WIindu anl Moham medan Simahs They held it till it was again subluel after some diiclllty by the Tatar conquerors of Iehll who for a time used the Simahs to govern it Nadir Shah annexed it to his crown and it formel a portion of the kinlom of Kabul raised up by Ahmel Shah one of his generals to which it is nonlinally subject at this day In the time of Nadir the country was granted to the Kaloras a religiolls family from Beluchistan In the reign of Tinllir Shah of Kabul it was conferred on the Talpur family also of Beldch origin ho now hold it The inhabitants of Sind are much scattered but the country is not populous In traditional poesy it is said to be  natb lakhi SindXh that is ninelac Sind The meaning of this is obscure but I do not discard it for the same rhyming statistics assign  Chaud Chari or 14 times40560 to Kachh Though in excess of its number of inhabited places this is sufficiently near to be understood Sind is said to have a lac of pirs or saints tombs in it To quit legends Sind has a vast numloer of vil lages most of which are moveable In the desert they are called  Wand near the river Raj and Tanda The temporary villages of Sirld are listinctly mentionecl by the Greeks It is difficult in consequence to fix the opulation of Sind it is difficult even to fix the number of inhabited places A village is often changed and if stationary it even changes its name with its owner This is but a remnant of the pastoral life of the abori gines No two maps of Sind can resemble one another The provinces or subdivisions of it even change names I find no less than fifty names of these in one author and he says that their limits run into each other Even in Alexanders times we have the names of so many kingdoms on the Indus that we can only account for them by exaggeration to enhance the conquests of the Greeks The whole population may amount to a million The greater portion of it is moveable The lar places are not nu merous ShikErpur is the first in importance anl has a popula tion of about 25000 which surpasses that of the modern capital  Iletmishis theparticiple past of the verb iletmekto bear lead c Altmish  sixty is not

Rori anl Sakkar SehwAn Hala and Karachhi which latter is a seaport and the only one accessible to ships in the country The inhabitants of Sind are chiefly Mohammedan A fourth of the population may be Hindu There are no people of other tribes or creeds if we except a few Sikhs of the Panjab called Sikh Lohani The Mohammedans are tall and well proportioned very darkin complexion All other Mohammedans shave the hair of the head but the Sindians preserve it which gives them a look very diSerent from other Asiatics They also wear caps instead of turbans Sindhi is a term generally used for those who live in temporary villages They are mostly the original inhabitants converted to Islam who have intermarried with the conquerors There are Mohammedans in Sind and Hindus in Kachh who claim one lineage The Hindus do not differ from those in India They are fairer than the Mohammelans The Lohani and Bhatia tribes prevail they are purely commercial They are not op pressed more than in other Mohammedan countries They are often employed in places of confidence They amass wealth Iut they conceal it and wish to appear poor The subjugation of Sind has been always facilitated ly the Indus India escaped in many places the inrrads from the West but Sind was one of the earliest conquests of every invader It is easily accessible from the Panjab but it is separated frm India by a desert Sind has very little resemblance to India on that account The people have not the effeminacy of the Indian nor have they the polish of the Persian They are less civilized than either ignorant and very bigoted This arises from tlle nature of their government It continues from the limited con nexion with other countries The Mohammedan invasion involveel a change of creed among the people anl the impression has never been eSaced The dynasty of the Kaloras was religious ancl the effect of it is apparent everywhere It has been well said that in Sind there is no spirit but in celelrating tlle ilf no liberality but in feeding lazy Sayyads anl no taste but in ornamenting old tombs  The lesire to propagate the faith does llOt noxv interfere with a certain degree of toleration towards the Hinlus that tribe is not respected but it is not degraded An unclean idolater is a com mon term of reproach but has much the same acceptation in Sind as heretic has among Protestants and Roman Catholics Justice is meted out to both if it cannot be claimed it is not re  03 Larkhani t The Festival at the end of Ramazan Lent called Bairam by the Turks F Stn Sind 16  fused There are no great Hindu buildings in Sind but there are at tlle same time no grand Mohammedan ones except a mosque and some tombs at Thathah The government of Sind may be called despotic Its rulers the Amirs are restrained by no laws though they pretend to abide by the dicta of the Keran in their administlation of justice There are no officers such as Kazis or M6las who exercise independent their functions or receive their patronage and en courageinent Sayyads and Fakirs are however respected to venerationa tlle one as leing descended from the line of the ro phet the other as following or pretending to follow a life of great austerity Many of the fakirs are without doubt virtuous men but the great bulk are hypocritical fanatics The universal re spect shown to them seems to have corrupted the lanl The mendicants in Sind are more numerous than in any other country in Asia They can scarcely be called beggars for they levy tri Iute in crowds and by threats with great arrogance Many of the common people take to this profitable vocation lvhich only requires some show of sanctity This is exhibited in various ways one of the most common is to sit all night on the housetop and repeat the sacred name of  Allah or God as many thousand times as the tongue can utter it In Sind religion takes the worst possible turn It does not soften the disposition of the rulers or the asperities of the people  it lecomes a trade and its worthless professors detrade it and themselses T this there is no counteracting effiect in the Government which lJesides encou raging these worthies is in itself politically oppressive Trade and agriculture languish under it The people have no stimulus to moral rectitude anl yet they are less degraded than might be lookel for They are passionate as well as proud They hase much subtle flattery but this does not deceive in Sind If trusted the Sindian is honest if believed he is not false if kindly treated he is grateful I reeat that in oppression the Aohammedan and the Hindu appear to be pretty equal sharers Without political freedom and with mistlirected religious zeal Sinl canllot boast of the condition of its population There is no intermediate class between the rulers their favoured Sayyads and the common people Some Hindus are rich but the mass of the people are poor Their dress subdued man ners and filth all attest it They have no education few of them call read wery few write In physical form they seem alapted for activity the reverse is their character Their faclll ties appear lenumbed Both sexes Hindu and Mohamme dan ale allicted to Bang an intoxicating drut made from hemp They also clrink a spirit distillel from rice and dates Debauchery is universal anl the powers of man are often imOn Sind paired in early life They do not seek for other than gross and sensual amusements People only congregate to wisit the tombs of worthies or saints who are deemed capable of repairing the wastel and liseased lsody as well as the soul They have tew social qualifications and even in common life keep up meeh formal ceremony There are no healthful esercises among the peasantry whot as well as the grandees of the land leal a life of sloth To be fat is a distinction A better government would ameliorate the conlition of this people without it the Sindiall anl his country will continue in the hopeless and cheerless state here represented I senture to reverse the observation of Mon tesquieu and say that the mediocrity of their alJilities and fortunes is fatal to their private happiness The eSect is also fatal to the public prosperity It is unnecessary to state that the sciences are not cultivated in Sind The arts however exhibit some taste anl ingenuity Leather is letter prepared than in any part of India and their lflngis or silkcotton cloths are rich and beautiflll The artisan receives no encouragement the peasant has no reward for his toil The langurlge of Sinl is of Hindl origin The upper classes speak corruptel Persian tlle lower orlers a jargon of Sinelhi ancl Panjabi Sindhi is a written language A despotic government is necessarily upheld by force The citizen is lost in the sollier The great portion of the land in Sind is held on the tenure of affiorling military service Ex ternal enemies are not now to loe much dreadel so that the fetters of the people are forgetl for themselves They furnish their rulers with the means to opress They never knew a citizens rights and they are as ignorant of their own strength as of their rulers weakness Most of the chiefs in Sinl are Belliches In their relative position to the people they in some degree re sembIe the Mamluks of Egypt They are not however re cruited as was that body from abroal though they keep uv a connesion with their natlve country They are the last invalers of Sind The time of their inroad I cannot fis but it was prc bably a succession of inroads It is now difficult to distintuish a Beluch from any other Sindian for they have intermarried with the people They preserve however with care their lineage anl name their tribes with honour The Sindians complain of the opressioll of the T3eliches but habit has sulJduel their energies to resist The military power of bSind is considerable For an Asiatic state it is respectable though without discipline T1le force consists of infantry  the arms are a matchlock and sword The former is of a lescription eculiar to Silld There are few horses so that there is a want of cavalry There are guns in Sinl but their artillery is alvays illscrred ane1 neglectel On tOL lII C18 On Sind a foreign inroad the country would rise in arms and the three different Talpur chiefs would contribute their contingents to meet the enemy From an European force I believe they would shrink without resistance certainly without any persevering opposition As a soldier the Sindian is considered brave at least he is respected by his neighbours and often hired by them as a mercenary He does not lose his reputation by beingforced to yield to disciplined valour which is an exotic The productions bothvegetable and animal in Sind differ but little from other parts of India Most of the former haxre been already mentioned Many of the European vegetables that are now so coinmon in India have not been introducel Apples are however found even so low as Thathah The climate of Sind is variable In the winter the cold is great ice is common In summer the heat is most oppressive and rain is almost un known The dust is intolerable The clayey nature of the soil admits osf all moisture being soon exhaled and the least winfl raises clouds of impalpalule powder The houses require venti lators in the roof and the 7indows and doors are made of the smallest dimensions to exclude the dust Altogether the climate of Sind is sultry and disagreeable and very trying to the consti tution The only remarkable tenant of the Indus is the sable fish pala which enters the river four months during the year This fish is not found in any other of the rivers of Western India it is highly flavoured Game of all kinds is abundant in Sind but the country is thick and it is diicult to kill it The camels and buffaloes of Sind are superior and very numerous The horned cattle and sheep are in general larger than those of India Of all tllese there are vast herds They are to be found both near the river and away from it All that tract between Sind and India and north of the Ran of Kachh is frequented by herdsmen and shepherds who find rater in wells and tanks They live in wands and are erratic in their habits The tract is much more frequented than its apearance in the map where it is described as a desert would suggest There is pas ture between the sandhills and they themselves are not destitute of verdure The paliG salvadora persica karzlt capparis aphylla babul mimosa Farnesiana and phok are its principal productions with the thorny milk bush and swallow wort asclepias gigantea The geological features of Sind need not detain me I found fossil shells at Jerk and Lukhpat At the latter place some of these weighed twelve and sisteen pounals English and were in a  Great Salt Morass  This is the Arak of the Arabs not Bruces iRack also callel Karlr and Kair The author writes khureel so that the Sindhians probably say kharil with an aspirateal hF SOn Sind 19 perfect state of preservation They were imbedded in limestone Westward of the Indus various kinds of marble are found Limestone indeed appears to be the principal formation Sand stone also exists I found a small piece of it about forty miles north of Lukhpat imbedded in the soil which for the first foot was mixed with freshwater shells There are many mineral springs in the Hala mountains It has been already observed that the most striking geographi cal feature of Sind is the Indus Its length of course anl the body of water discharged lJy this river prove it to be one of the largest in the old world Its tribu taries even are rivers of some magnitude The Hydaspes Hy drxiotes and Hesudrus are superior tv the Rhone The course of the Hyphasis is forty miles longer than that of the Elbe and only sixty less than that of tlle Rlline Yet the channel of the Indus sellom exceeds the width of half a mile In the winter it is even narrower During the season of inundation the diSerent branches which it throws oS are filled By October they become unnavigable and stagnant The Indus is a foul river and very mully with numerous shoals and sandbanks Though there is generally a depth of twelve feet in the shallowest parts flat bottomed boats only can navigate it The reason of this is that vessels with a keel get fixed on the banks and vvould be de stroyed The Indus is navigable for about 1200 miles from the sea Boats may drop down it from within fifty miles of Kabul Above its junction with the river of Kabul the Indus is not navigable After the Indus has fairly entered Sind it throws of its branches At Bhakar which is an insulated fortress of flint on the Inlus below the latitude of 28 the superfluous waters of the inundation are sometimes drained of by a channel In two years out of three it is dry but when this channel is followed the water passes the ancient city of Alor four mies from XE3hakar and through the desert near Amerkot to the Eastern mouth or Kori Some authors suppose this to have been vnce the course of the great river The reasons are more specious than probable The first permanent oSset of the Indus is the Feleili which passes eastward of the capital Haiderabad It successively takes on the name of GLuni Psharan and Wori and separates Wachh from Sind in the lower part of its course The next off set takes its departure near Jerk and is namecl Pinyari It afterwards is called txungra and where it enters the sea Sir both these branches the Feleili and Pinyxiri have been closed by  bands or dams for the purpose of irrigation At their estuaries therefore they are but creeks of the sea and have salt instead of fresh water if the inundation does not make themfresh by its excess Some remarkable changes were brought about in the eastern mouth from an earthquake in 1819 lty which a large tract of land was and still continues submerged About five miles below Thcathah the Indus forms its Delta by dividing into twobranches These bear the names of Bagar and Sata The first runs oW at right antles westward the other flows southward The Bagar passes Pir Pattah Darzaji and LAhori Banders and enters the sea by txvo subdivisions the Piti anl Pitiycini The Satct subdivicles into seven streams anci reaches the sea by the mouths f Juwah Richel Hajamciri Khexliwari Gora and Mall There are everl other subdivi sions but it wouXl only confuse to name them All these mouths have communication with each other so that the internal navigaticn of the Delta is extensive The course of the waters of the Inelus is most capricious ancl inconstcant One year the Bagcir is lr anl in another the Sata sllares a like fate In 1809 the principal portion of the vaters were lisembogued by the Bcigtir In 1831 their channel of etress was confined to the Sata The seven mouths of tlle Satti even vary in their supply of water but one branch of the Indus is alXays caccessible to country boats The great mouth at lzresent is the Gora but from sanlbanks it is not accessible to ships Those mouths shich discharge least water are most accessible Kachh January 1836 III Narrative of a Journey from the Tower of 73a171ag on t7te Sotlthern Coctst of Arabia to the Ruins of Nakab a Hajar tn

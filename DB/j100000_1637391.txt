j100000,Science,1637391,West Elizabeth Pennsylvania Deep Well,i296188,JULY 28 1911 SCIENCE The Optical Properties of Crystals with a general introduction to their physical properties being selected parts of the Physical Crystallography By P GROTH Professor of Mineralogy and Crystallog raphy in the University of Munich Translated with the authors permission from the fourth revised and augmented German edition by B H JACKSON ME MA of the University of Colorado 8vo xiv  309 pages with 121 figures in the text and two colored plates Cloth 350 New York John Wiley  Sons London Chapman  Hall Limited 1910 This is a partial translation of the well known work of Professor von Groth Physi kalische Krystallographie which is gener ally regarded by those who have to deal with optical crystallography as the best non mathematical treatise on this subject yet pro duced The translation to quote from the translators prefatory note is made up chiefly of matter contained in Part I of the original work on the properties of crystals besides embracing the general introduction and all that falls under the heading optical properties in this part it includes also what ever may be found there on the influence of other properties on the optical properties Short extracts from Parts II Systematic Description of Crystals and III The Methods of Crystal Investigation have been introduced on occasion for illustration and example The scope of the work may be gathered from the headings of the principal divisions which are as follows General Introduction to the Properties of Crystals The Nature of Light Combination Interference of Plane polarized Light Optically Isotropic Bodies Double Refraction of Light Optically Uni axial Crystals Optically Biaxial Crystals Recapitulation Classification of Crystals According to their Optical Properties Com binations of Doubly Refracting Crystals to show the Character of their Double Refraction Rotation of the Plane of Polari zation of Light in Crystals Absorption of Light in Crystals Influence of other Proper ties on the Optical Properties of Crystals in cluding Thermal Properties Elastic Strain by Mechanical Forces and by Electrical Forces Permanent Strain and Twinning The translation is excellent the English being free and idiomatic but following closely the original text The work is entirely within the comprehension of any student who knows the rudiments of crystallography and forms a muchneeded and very welcome addition to the English textbooks in the field covered by it The colored plates reproduced from the original work are excellent I comprises a spectrum of white light and a Newtonian color scale of the first four orders II pre sents the important types of interference fig ures in convergent light in thirteen figures An appendix contains a useful list of Ger man and American supply houses for appa ratus models crystals and preparations English firms might well have been added to this list CHARLES PALACHE SPECIAL ARTICLES WEST ELIZABETH PENNSYLVANIA DEEP WELL1 I AM indebted to Dr I C White2 state geologist of West Virginia for calling my at tention to the omission from my paper pub lished in SCIENCE May 26 1911 under the title Underground Temperatures of an important deep boring made in 1897 in Alle gheny County Pa The data relating to this well are so important as to be worthy of a separate note The well is located on Peters Creek about two and one half miles west of West Eliza beth Allegheny County Pa and about twelve miles southsoutheast of Pittsburgh It is the deepest well drilled in the United States 1White I C West Virginia Geological Survey Vol IA 1904 pp 103107 Halloek W Subterranean Temperatures at Wheeling W Va and Pittsburg Pa School of Mines Quar terly 1897 Vol

its purpose drilling down and into the Corniferous limestone but after a depth of 5575 feet was reached an accident beyond repair occurred and further drilling was from necessity abandoned The well was begun 130 feet below the Pittsburgh coal and after passing through rocks of the Carbonif erous Pennsylvanian and Mississippian and of the Upper and most of the Middle Devo nian was bottomed 5575 feet in supposed Marcellus black shale probably not more than 100 feet above the Corniferous limestone The vast thickness of rocks penetrated by the well were all sedimentaries including accord ing to the log8 shales slates coal sandstones and limestones as the chief lithologic types At the request of Dr White Professor William Hallock of Columbia University was afforded every facility for measuring the tem perature of the well A brief statement of the temperatures measured in the well was pub lished by Professor Hallock in 1897 Five measurements made at different depths are recorded by Dr White These may be tabu lated as follows  TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENTS IN WEST ELIZABETH DEEP WELL Tempera Difference in ture at temperature for 525 ft 57 F 2252 ft 64 1677 ft 7 F 2397 ft 78 445 ft 14

heat is shown to be exceed ingly variable and is in accord with many other deep wells over the earths surface in which temperature measurements have been 8 A complete log of the well is published by Dr White in Volume IA of the West Virginia Geological Survey 1904 pp 104107 4 Hallock W School of Mines Quarterly 1897 pp 151153 5Data taken from Vol IA of West Virginia Geological Survey 1904 pp 104107 made The explanation offered for the varia tion in temperature shown in this well is the presence of a considerable flow of natural gas from the Bayard sand at 2282T feet The average increment of heat for a depth of 4855 feet which represents the difference be tween the least 525 feet and the greatest 5380 feet depths at which temperature measurements were made is 1 F for every 6937 feet THOMAS L WATSON UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA ADDITIONAL NOTE ON RETICULATED FISHSCALES SINCE the publication of my recent account of dipnoan fish scales in SCIENCE some in teresting facts have come to light 1 Dr L Hussakof of the American Mu seum of Natural History has very kindly placed in my hands scales of Sagenodus from the Carboniferous rocks of Mazon Creek Illi nois A welldeveloped scale is oval about 50 mm long and 37 broad and in appear ance and structure essentially agrees with the scale of the living Australian Neoceratodus The reticulations are evident and the very fine basal longitudinal fibrillse are minutely tuberculate Thus we have positive evidence of the enormous antiquity of this type of scale including even the details of structure 2 A specimen of the sucker Moxostoma cervinum Cope collected by Dr B W Ever mann proves to have two kinds of scales One has a quadrate form with strong latero basal angles strong apical and basal radii the circuli dense in the basal and lateral fields but widely spaced in the apical This is the sort of scale we are accustomed to find in Moxostoma a scale strongly suggestive of various oldworld cyprinids The other type of scale has the laterobasal angles more rounded radial lines running to the margin 6 Professor Hallock states that  the thermome ters at 2250 feet indicated a cooling due to the ex pansion of the gas amounting to about 14 Op cit p 153 Gas volume 25 lbs per min West Virginia Geol Survey Vol IA p 105 7 Professor Hallock gives the increment of heat from top to bottom 5000 feet of well as 1 F for 715

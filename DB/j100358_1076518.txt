J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1076518,THE SCHOOL PHASES OF VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE,I244680,THE SCHOOL PHASES OF VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE FRANK M LEAVITT UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO THE NEED FOR SUCH GUIDANCE AS WILL ENABLE YOUTHFUL WORKERS TO ADJUST THEMSELVES TO THE COMPLEX AND RAPIDLY CHANGING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OF OUR TIMES IS CLEARLY RECOGNIZED BY ALL THOUGHTFUL AND INTERESTED PEOPLE IT IS NOT QUITE SO CLEAR HOWEVER WHERE THE DUTY OF THE SCHOOL BEGINS OR TERMINATES IN ASSISTING IN SUCH ADJUSTMENT MEDICAL INSPECTION AS IT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED IN PUBLICSCHOOL SYSTEMS DURING THE LAST DECADE OFFERS AN EXCELLENT PARALLEL WHEN REASONABLY HYGIENIC CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED AND WHEN THE SCHOOL NURSE OR THE SCHOOL PHYSICIAN HAS DIAGNOSED THE INDIVIDUAL CASE AND HAS REFERRED IT TO THE PRIVATE DOCTOR OR TO THE FREE DISPEN SARY FOR TREATMENT THE SCHOOL IS CONSIDERED BY MANY TO HAVE DONE ITS FULL DUTY IN THE SAME WAY THE PUBLIC SCHOOL MAY BE CONSIDERED AS ONLY PARTIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE NECESSARY VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE THE CONTRIBUTING AGENCIES BEING THE FREE PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT OFFICE OR THE PRIVATE VOCATION BUREAU SIMILARLY THERE SHOULD BE A LOGICAL DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITY ON AN AGE BASIS THE ADULT OF THIRTY PRESENTING A PROBLEM WHICH THE PUB LIC SCHOOL OR AT LEAST THE PUBLIC SECONDARY SCHOOL NEED NOT CONSIDER THE SCHOOL MAY PROPERLY BE REQUIRED TO INTEREST ITSELF IN THE EARLIER VOCATIONAL EXPERIENCES OF THE YOUTH OF THE COMMUNITY WITHOUT COM MITTING ITSELF TO THE DUTY OF SUPERVISING OCCUPATIONAL ADJUSTMENTS THROUGHOUT THE VICISSITUDES OF A LONG AND CONSTANTLY CHANGING ECONOMIC LIFE IN OTHER WORDS PROVIDING FOR A START IN LIFE MAY BECOME A SCHOOL FUNCTION WITHOUT REQUIRING THE PUBLIC SCHOOL TO EXERCISE A LIFELONG GUIDANCE IN DEVELOPING A PROGRAM FOR VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE THEREFORE WE MUST DISTINGUISH CLEARLY BETWEEN THE IMMEDIATE AND THE ULTIMATE PURPOSE AND MUST REALIZE THAT THE FORMER IS THE MORE PERTINENT AND THAT THE NEXT STEP IS THE MOST IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION A COM MON CRITICISM OF OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM IN GENERAL HAS BEEN THAT ITS AIMS 687THE SCHOOL REVIEW ARE TOO REMOTE BOTH IN TIME AND IN PLACE TO FIX THE ATTENTION AND HOLD THE INTEREST OF MOST OF THE PUPILS TO FOLLOW SUCH A PRECEDENT IN INAUGURATING A SYSTEM OF VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE WILL BE FATAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THE MOVEMENT SINCE VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE HAS TO DO WITH THE START IN LIFE AND SINCE IT NECESSITATES AN ARTICULATION BETWEEN THE SCHOOL AND OCCUPA TIONS THE TIME AT WHICH IT MAY BE EXERCISED MOST INTELLIGENTLY IS THAT AT WHICH THE PUPIL LEAVES SCHOOL VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE THERE FORE AS A SCHOOL FUNCTION MAY BE CLASSIFIED ROUGHLY TO CORRESPOND TO THREE MAJOR GROUPS OF PUPILS FIRST THERE IS THE GROUP WHICH LEAVES SCHOOL AT THE TERMINATION OF THE COMPULSORY AGE LIMIT WITH ABOUT AN EIGHTHGRADE TRAINING PERHAPS A LITTLE MORE OR A LITTLE LESS WHILE INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN THE CAPACITIES AMBITIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES OF THE MEMBERS OF THIS GROUP WILL RESULT IN WIDELY DIFFERING SUCCESS IN LATER LIFE IN THE MAIN THE EARLY OCCUPATIONAL NEEDS OF THE SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE GROUP ARE IDENTICAL AND THE SAME METHOD OF EXERCISING VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE IS PROPER FOR ALL THIS METHOD MAY BE DESIGNATED AS EMPLOYMENT SUPERVISION IT MAY BE SAID IN PASSING THAT THIS METHOD REQUIRES FOR ITS HIGHEST EFFICIENCY A SYSTEM OF COMPULSORY CONTINUATION SCHOOLS SECOND THERE IS THE GROUP OF PUPILS WHO WILL SPEND FROM TWO TO FOUR YEARS IN THE HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR BUT WHO ARE NOT CONTEMPLATING A COLLEGE CAREER AGAIN WHILE INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES WILL ULTIMATELY DISTRIBUTE THE MEMBERS OF THIS GROUP WIDELY THEIR NEED FOR VOCA TIONAL GUIDANCE WHICH THE SCHOOL CAN MEET MOST EFFECTUALLY IS THE IMMEDIATE ONE AND THE METHOD WHICH IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE FOR MEETING IT MAY BE TERMED VOCATIONAL INFORMATION AND PLACE MENT IN PASSING IT MAY BE SAID THAT THE VALUE OF SUCH VOCATIONAL INFORMATION AND PLACEMENT WILL BE ENHANCED MANY FOLD BY HIGH SCHOOL COURSES OF INSTRUCTION WITH A VOCATIONAL CONTENT THOUGH SOME GUIDANCE MAY BE GIVEN WITHOUT INTENSIVE VOCATIONAL COURSES THIRD THERE IS THE GROUP WHICH IS CLEARLY ON ITS WAY TO HIGHER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS THE PRIMARY DUTY OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL TO THIS GROUP SO FAR AS VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE IS CONCERNED MAY BE DESIGNATED BY THE TERM EDUCATIONAL GUIDANCE 688SCHOOL PHASES OF VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE JUDGING FROM SOME EXCELLENT EXPERIMENTAL WORK WHICH HAS BEEN DONE WITH THE FIRST GROUP THERE WOULD SEEM TO BE NO GOOD REASON WHY EDUCATIONAL AUTHORITIES SHOULD NOT ASSUME A DEGREE OF RESPON SIBILITY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE UP TO SIXTEEN OR EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE EVEN IF THEY HAVE SEVERED THEIR CONNECTION WITH THE REGULAR PUBLIC SCHOOL IN FACT THERE ARE MANY EXCELLENT REASONS WHY FOR THE SAKE OF SOCIETY AS WELL AS FOR THE SAKE OF THE CHILDREN EVEN MORE CAREFUL AND MORE SOLICITOUS CARE SHOULD BE GIVEN TO SUCH CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY HAVE ENTERED UPON THE EXACTING DUTIES OF OCCUPATIONAL LIFE THAT CHIL DREN ARE AT WORK IS NO REASON WHY THEY DO NOT NEED EDUCATION THOUGH THEY REQUIRE A DIFFERENT KIND OF EDUCATION FROM THAT WHICH IS POSSIBLE IN THE REGULAR SCHOOL IT IS OF PRIME IMPORTANCE THAT THEY BE SO GUIDED AS TO GET ALL POSSIBLE EDUCATION OUT OF THEIR DAILY OCCU PATION WHICH THEY ARE NOT LIKELY TO DO UNLESS CAREFULLY AND INTELLI GENTLY SUPERVISED BY THE EDUCATIONAL AUTHORITIES IT IS FUTILE TO TALK ABOUT THE VALUE OF THE LIFECAREER MOTIVE IN THE GUIDANCE OF THIS GROUP FOR MOST WILL HAVE TO BE CONTENTED WITH  JOBS  FOR MANY YEARS AND PERHAPS MAY NEVER ENTER UPON A GENUINE CAREER OR VOCATION WHATEVER MAY BE POSSIBLE IN THE WAY OF ADVANCEMENT FOR INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS OF THIS GROUP THE VAST MAJORITY WILL CONSTITUTE THE RANK AND FILE OF THE INDUSTRIAL ARMY AND THEIR GREATEST SUCCESS AND HAPPINESS DEPENDS UPON THEIR ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND THEIR CONDITION AND TO MAKE THE MOST OF THE OPPOR TUNITIES WHICH IT PRESENTS FOR WORK AND FOR LEISURE HOW CAN THIS BEST BE ACCOMPLISHED  CAREFUL STUDY OF THE OCCUPATIONS OF THE CHILDREN OF THIS GROUP INVARIABLY REVEALS THE FACT THAT THERE MUST OF NECESSITY BE CONSIDER ABLE MIGRATION FROM JOB TO JOB WHILE FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE EMPLOYER THIS MIGRATION IS WHOLLY BAD FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE INDIVIDUAL THERE ARE EDUCATIONAL POSSIBILITIES IN SUCH VARIETY OF OCCUPATION AND THIS POSSIBILITY WILL BE GREATLY ENHANCED WHEN THE SCHOOL AUTHORITIES ARE IN A POSITION TO CONTROL THE CHANGES TO SOME EXTENT TO ADVISE AGAINST UNDUE AND UNNECESSARY JOB HOBO ISM AND TO COUNSEL THE INDIVIDUAL WHENEVER A CHANGE IS MADE IN ALL THIS THERE IS RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT ALL EDUCATION IS NOT OBTAINED IN THE SCHOOL BUT THAT THE EDUCATION WHICH ONE GETS 689THE SCHOOL REVIEW FROM HIS DAILY TOIL MAY BE GREATLY ENHANCED IF THE SCHOOL AUTHORITIES ASSUME THE RESPONSIBILITY OF GUIDING AND COUNSELING YOUNG WORKERS REFERRING AGAIN IN THIS CONNECTION TO THE CONTINUATION SCHOOL IT SHOULD BE SAID THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO MAINTAIN CONTINUATION SCHOOLS WITHOUT EXERCISING EMPLOYMENT SUPERVISION AS DESCRIBED ABOVE AND CONVERSELY IT IS POSSIBLE TO EXERCISE VOCATIONAL SUPERVISION WITH OUT ESTABLISHING COMPULSORY CONTINUATION SCHOOLS FOR SECURING THE GREATEST RETURN FROM EITHER VOCATIONAL SUPERVISION OR THE CON TINUATION SCHOOL HOWEVER IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE TWO BE LINKED AND IT IS PREFERABLE THAT THEY BE ADMINISTERED BY THE SAME SCHOOL OFFICIAL IT SHOULD ALSO BE SAID THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PREVOCATIONAL CLASSES OR OF THE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL WILL GREATLY REDUCE THE NEED OF THIS FORM OF GUIDANCE SINCE MANY MORE PUPILS WILL BE HELD IN SCHOOL THEREBY AND WILL THUS BE BROUGHT INTO THE SECOND GROUP PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT PHASE OF VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE AS FAR AS THE SECONDARY SCHOOL IS CONCERNED IS THAT WHICH IS PECULIARLY APPROPRIATE FOR THE SECOND GROUP AND WHICH WAS DESIGNATED ABOVE AS VOCATIONAL INFORMATION AND PLACEMENT SEVERAL INTERESTING EXPERIMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE SMALLER HIGH SCHOOLS WHICH DEMONSTRATE BEYOND THE SHADOW OF A DOUBT THAT IT IS POSSIBLE SO TO COLLECT AND TO IMPART SUCH INFORMATION ABOUT VOCATIONS IN GENERAL AND TO SHOW THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THESE VOCATIONS AND THE VARIOUS SUBJECTS OF INSTRUCTION IN THE HIGHSCHOOL CURRICULUM AS TO CAUSE THE WHOLE HIGHSCHOOL SITUATION TO TAKE ON A NEW ASPECT TO THE PUPILS AND TO THE TEACHERS AS WELL FOR PURPOSES OF VOCATIONAL INFORMATION THE FORMAL TRADITIONAL ACADEMIC COURSES ARE VITALIZED BY REFERENCE TO VOCATIONAL WORK AND EVEN THE COURSES IN HANDWORK RECEIVE A NEW IMPULSE NEW COURSES ARE ORGANIZED TO INFORM THE PUPILS REGARDING THE NATURE REQUIRE MENTS AND REWARDS OF VARIOUS OCCUPATIONS THE PERSONAL CHARACTER ISTICS AND SPECIFIC TRAINING WHICH WILL RENDER ONE MOST LIKELY TO ACHIEVE SUCCESS IN THEM AND THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE THUS TRAINED WHICH THE LOCAL AND THE MORE DISTANT FIELDS OFFER SUCH COURSES INCLUDE ELEMENTS OF HISTORY ECONOMICS AND SOCIOLOGY AND ARE MORE GENUINELY CULTURAL THAN MUCH OF THE SCHOOL WORK WHICH IS JUSTIFIED MAINLY ON THAT GROUND AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF THIS 69OSCHOOL PHASES OF VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE TYPE OF VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE WAS DESCRIBED IN AN ARTICLE BY D W HORTON IN THE SCHOOL REVIEW APRIL I9I5 THE FOREGOING WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT THERE IS MUCH MATERIAL PERTINENT TO VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE WHICH MAY BE COLLECTED AND THAT THE GREAT NEED IS FOR ITS COORDINATION AND ITS ADAPTATION TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PUPILS SUCH CO ORDINATION MUST BE WORKED OUT THROUGH EXPERIENCE WITH CHILDREN IN ORDER TO TEST THE EFFICIENCY OF THE PLAN AND TO PROVE THAT THE INFORMATION GIVEN HAS REAL GUIDING POWER ALL THIS WILL REQUIRE TIME AND INTELLIGENT PATIENCE BUT ANY BEGINNING HOWEVER CRUDE WILL BE OF GREAT VALUE TO THE CAUSE FOR A GENERAL DISCUSSION OF THIS QUESTION OF GIVING VOCATIONAL INFORMATION TO HIGHSCHOOL PUPILS AND FOR SOME SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF SUCH INFORMATION THE FOLLOWING REFERENCES WILL BE FOUND USEFUL DAVIS VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE GINN  CO BLOOMFIELD YOUTH SCHOOL AND VOCATION HOUGHTON MIFFLIN CO PARSONS

DEWITT HYDE EDITOR VOCATIONS IO VOLS HALL  LOCKE CO THIRTEENTH CENSUS OF THE UNITED STATES ABSTRACT TO ACHIEVE THE FULLEST MEASURE OF SUCCESS FOR ANY PLAN OF VOCA TIONAL GUIDANCE FOR THE GROUP UNDER DISCUSSION SOME PROVISION FOR PLACEMENT MUST BE MADE IN THE LARGER CITIES THIS MAY POSSIBLY BE ACCOMPLISHED MOST EFFECTIVELY BY COOPERATING WITH ESTABLISHED AGENCIES SUCH AS THE PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT OFFICE IF ONE EXISTS IN THE COMMUNITY OR WITH THE EMPLOYMENT DEPARTMENT OF THE YMCA OR THE YWCA IN BOSTON A PLACEMENT BUREAU ESTABLISHED BY AGENCIES OUTSIDE OF THE SCHOOL IS DOING EFFECTIVE WORK WITH PUBLICSCHOOL CHILDREN THE BUREAU IS OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED BY THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE AND A THOROUGH SYSTEM OF BLANK FORMS FOR REGISTRATION AND REPORTS IS USED BY ALL THE SCHOOLS IN THEIR DEALINGS WITH THE BUREAU THERE IS NO REASON HOWEVER WHY SUCH A BUREAU SHOULD NOT BE DEVELOPED GRADUALLY IN ANY SCHOOL SYSTEM THERE HAS BEEN A RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF THIS IDEA DURING THE PAST TWO OR THREE YEARS AND 69ITHE SCHOOL REVIEW DOUBTLESS THE PLACEMENT BUREAU AT LEAST IN EMBRYO COULD BE FOUND IN MANY SCHOOLS SEVERAL DIFFERENT PLANS HAVE BEEN WORKED OUT TWO OF WHICH WILL BE MENTIONED HERE THE SCHOOL SYSTEM OF LINCOLN NEBRASKA HAS ESTABLISHED AN EFFICIENCY LIST WHICH IS OPEN TO THE INSPECTION OF THE EMPLOYERS OF THAT CITY ENROLMENT ON THIS LIST IS NOT GAINED BY SCHOLARSHIP ALONE BUT BY DEMONSTRATING THAT ONE POSSESSES CERTAIN PERSONAL CHARAC TERISTICS WHICH ARE NECESSARY FOR SUCCESS IN VOCATIONAL LIFE WHILE THE CHARACTERISTICS WHICH ARE NOW BEING NOTED ARE OF A RATHER GENERAL NATURE UNDOUBTEDLY EXPERIENCE IN OPERATING THE SCHEME WILL DEVELOP THE DESIRABILITY OF RECORDING SPECIAL QUALIFICATIONS FOR PARTICULAR OCCUPATIONS IN ANY EVENT HALF THE OBJECT WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED WHEN THE BUSINESS MEN OF LINCOLN FORM THE HABIT OF CONSULTING THIS EFFICIENCY LIST AND THE SCHOOL AUTHORITIES WHEN IN NEED OF YOUNG EMPLOYEES THIS ARTICULATION OF SCHOOL AND BUSINESS IS SURE TO DEVELOP ANY PLAN OF THIS NATURE TO THE POINT OF EFFICIENCY ANOTHER FEATURE OF THE SCHOOL PLACEMENT PLAN IS FINELY ILLUSTRATED BY A RECENT DEVELOPMENT IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF ROCHESTER NEW YORK WHICH IS DESCRIBED IN THE FOLLOWING QUOTATIONS FROM A CIRCULAR OF INFORMATION ENTITLED COOPERATION BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND SCHOOLS AT PRESENT THE LAWS OF MOST OF OUR STATES ARE SO FAULTY THAT BOYS AND GIRLS UNDER SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE MAY DROP OUT OF SCHOOL FOR THE PURPOSE OF GOING TO WORK AND THEN REMAIN IN IDLENESS FOR MONTHS ONLY A VERY FEW STATES REQUIRE THEIR YOUTHS TO BE EITHER IN SCHOOL OR AT WORK NOT LONG AGO THE SUPERINTENDENT OF AN EASTERN TRADE SCHOOL INSERTED THE FOLLOWING ADVERTISEMENT IN ONE ISSUE OF A DAILY PAPER WANTEDBOYS AND GIRLS OUT OF WORK TO TAKE COURSES IN THE TRADE SCHOOL UNTIL POSITIONS ARE SECURED FOR THEM ONE SUCH INSERTION BROUGHT NEARLY A SCORE OF YOUNG PEOPLE TO THE SCHOOL POSITIONS FOR SOME OF THEM WERE FOUND IN A MONTH OTHERS WHO WERE NOT UNDER ECONOMIC PRESSURE BECAME INTERESTED IN THE SCHOOL WORK AND COMPLETED A YEARS COURSE DURING THIS YEAR OF BUSINESS DEPRESSION THE WASTE OF TIME THROUGH IDLENESS HAS BEEN GREATLY INCREASED IN AN ATTEMPT TO REMEDY THIS SITUATION TWO HUNDRED

MUNICIPAL BUILDING HOURS 9 TO 10 AM AND 430 TO 530 PM YAWMAN  ERBE MFG CO SEVENTYSEVEN BOYS AND GIRLS WHO HAD LEFT SCHOOL NEVER EXPECTING TO RETURN HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO REENTER SCHOOL MANY OF THEM WERE UNWILLING TO RETURN IF THEY WERE TO BE GIVEN ANY BOOK SUBJECTS THESE PUPILS WERE GIVEN TRADE WORK THAT WOULD FIT THEM FOR SOME POSITION THE GIRLS WERE ALSO TAUGHT THOSE SUBJECTS THAT WOULD HELP THEM TO IMPROVE THEIR HOME CONDITIONS GRADUALLY BECOMING INTERESTED IN THE SCHOOL WORK THEY HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO TAKE UP ENGLISH AND ARITHMETIC FOLLOWING IS THE RECORD SENT IN BY THE TEACHER OF ONE OF THE CLASSES 40 GIRLS ENROLLED DURING SIX MONTHS 3 LOST 26 PLACED IN POSITIONS II REMAINING THIS SIMPLE EXPERIMENT HAS BEEN WORTH WHILE IT SEEMS TO POINT TO A TIME WHEN BOYS AND GIRLS WILL KNOW THAT THE SUREST WAY TO GET A GOOD POSITION IS TO REMAIN IN SCHOOL WHEN THIS TIME ARRIVES THE FIGURES ON ELIMINATION WILL BE LESS FORMIDABLE THAN THEY ARE TODAY FOR THE THIRD GROUP NAMELY THOSE WHO ARE TO HAVE AN EXTENDED EDUCATION REACHING INTO THE COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY PLACEMENT IS OF COURSE ENTIRELY INAPPROPRIATE FOR THE HIGH SCHOOL THE VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE NEEDED HERE IS THE GIVING OF INFORMATION REGARDING THE SEVERAL PROFESSIONS THE OPPORTUNITIES WHICH THEY OFFER THE EXTENT AND NATURE OF THE PREPARATION DEMANDED THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES        C                          I       I 695THE SCHOOL REVIEW NEEDED FOR THIS PREPARATION AND FOR THE LEAN YEARS OF EARLY PRO FESSIONAL SERVICE AND THE VARIOUS EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS WHERE PREPARATION CAN BE SECURED TOGETHER WITH THE REQUIREMENTS AND ADVANTAGES OF EACH IN ADDITION TO THIS INFORMATION AS OUTLINED ABOVE VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE FOR THIS GROUP MAY WELL INCLUDE A STUDY OF THE PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE STUDENTS FOR THIS PURPOSE IT IS PROBABLE THAT PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS WILL ULTIMATELY BE OF SOME VALUE IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT THUS FAR THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN MEAGER AND THAT IN THE NATURE OF THE CASE THEY WILL ALWAYS BE USEFUL ONLY WITHIN RATHER NARROW LIMITS THE MOST THAT CAN BE EXPECTED OF THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TEST FOR VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE IN THE SECONDARY SCHOOL IS THE DIS COVERY OF TENDENCIES WHICH ARE MARKED TO AN EXTRAORDINARY DEGREE SPECIAL APTITUDES OR DISABILITIES IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF SCHOOL CHILDREN ABILITY TO IMPROVE UNDER TRAINING TO ADAPT ONES SELF TO THE ENVIRONMENT IS MORE MARKED THAN SPECIAL APTITUDES SO THAT GEO GRAPHIC SOCIAL ECONOMIC AND EDUCATIONAL CONDITIONS ARE MORE EFFECTIVE IN REVEALING ONES VOCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES THAN THE MOST ELABORATE SYSTEM OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS NEVERTHELESS WHEREVER SUCH TESTS CAN BE MADE AND INTERPRETED INTELLIGENTLY THEY SHOULD BE EMPLOYED FOR THEY WILL HELP IN PREVENTING SOME OF THE UNNECES SARY AND WASTEFUL STUMBLING AND INDIRECTION WHICH AT PRESENT MARK THE COLLEGE CAREERS OF SO MANY YOUTHS AND FINALLY IT SHOULD BE SAID THAT THE MOST CONVINCING ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE ARE THE NUMEROUS IF NOT EXTENSIVE PLANS WHICH HAVE BEEN PUT INTO OPERATION EXPERIMENTALLY DURING THE PAST FIVE YEARS THESE HAVE GENERALLY BEEN WORKED OUT BY PROGRES SIVE CONSERVATIVES IN EDUCATION WHO HAVE SEEN THE GREAT NEED AND HAVE TRIED TO MEET IT THESE EDUCATORS HAVE PROCEEDED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE IS NOT A NEW FUNCTION OF EDU CATION BUT RATHER AN OLD FUNCTION WHICH NEEDS LIBERAL EXTENSION AND THEY AFFIRM WITH PRACTICAL UNANIMITY THAT NOTHING HAS COME INTO THE SCHOOL SYSTEM WITHIN A GENERATION WHICH HAS CONTRIBUTED TO ITS EDUCATIONAL EFFICIENCY IN SUCH LARGE MEASURE AS HAS THE ORGANIZATION OF A SYSTEM OF VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 696

with ore deposits under conditions that may be observed is of more than passing interest and a closer study is in progress J CLAUDE JONES MACKAY SCHOOL OF MINES RENO NEVADA CERIUM IF any mineral collection contains speci mens of cerium ochre or yttrocerite from Bolton or any other Massachusetts locality I should be obliged to the curator of such col lection if he would inform me of the fact and give me briefly the history and description of the specimen B K EMERSON AMHERST MASS POPULARIZING SCIENCES THIRTY years ago the incorporated city of San Diego California possessed a population of perhaps two thousand Clergymen law yers teachers business men working men were alike members of the Society of Natural History and its president a physician kept up the interest in the monthly meetings Everybody came bringing a rock or a shell or a bird or some object curious or rare con tributing to the little museum and arousing discussion Today a sixstory concrete building is be ing erected on a lot given to the society for a home one floor to be used for its museum and library the other floors forming part of a hotel With a present population of near 50000 annual meetings are held by the so ciety which are generally attended by barely enough members for the election of officers The library and museum are at a standstill The meteorological records begun by the so cietys president are continued by a fully equipped station of the weather bureau of the U S Department of Agricultureof which we sometimes hear boastful but seldom in structive remarks A marine biological station has been estab lished under control of the state university and given 50000 for a buildingbut the public rarely hears of any results except of the occasional visit of some noted scientist as heralded in the dailies A floral society now exists and a botanical garden is proposed to which nurserymen will sometime be invited to contribute from their commercial stock but no strictly botanical work is in progress in the community and the only attempt in fifteen years met with failure for lack of appreciation The city contains three private collections of shells one of insects one of birds one or two of minerals two botanists without her baria one meteorologist in government em ploy and a few others interested inactively in some phase of science or about one nat uralist to each five thousand people which I have seen stated to be about the average num ber in the United States I recently visited one of the nearby grand ocean beaches where the sea still breaks in spray over the rocks as it did thirty years agobut the pools that formerly concealed a wealth of beautiful wonders in animal and plant life have been scraped clean of their former treasures Now and then a crab scuttles to safety A hook and line some times brings one of the finny tribe from the deepbut boys and girls can hunt in vain for the many nature treasures that formerly lined the shores of ocean and nearby bay Children may still reap a treasure in wild flowers in springtimeby taking generous car rides and then walkingbut they will look in vain in our paved streets for the trapdoor spiders nest that I formerly watched or for the miniature plants like the lichens that formerly freely decorated barren spots of earth With the increased cost of living with leaps and bounds in the growth of our com mercial life with a corner lot that cost 5000 ten years ago now yielding an annual rental of 6000 to its purchaser can you expect to find nature study gaining ground Science as a study is becoming too compli cated for a layman to take part in the active 776 SCIENCESCIENCE fashion of former times and it is becoming yearly more expensive and difficult for one in private life to keep abreast of the times even by specializing in a restricted field And opportunities for one to do good scien tific work with any chance of earning expense money are exceeding rareunless a salaried position is secured in advance The increased number of scientific and edu cational institutions apparently fail to give equal facilities with the past to the independ ent youthful student And the increase in volume of literature renders it impossible for any one not connected with some wealthy in stitution or with large private means to keep posted on proposed changes in nomenclature to say nothing of the new discoveries being made There is no decrease in the interest of the general public in scientific work but the ex isting state of affairs is probably due chiefly to expansion and greatly increased activity resulting in a mass of unassimilated data and museums bursting beyond the bounds set by their founders C R OROUTT SCIENTIFIC BOOKS A Cyclopedia of American Medical Biography Comprising the Lives of Eminent Deceased Physicians and Surgeons from 1610 to 1910 By HOWARD A KELLY MD Illus trated with Portraits Two Volumes Philadelphia and London W B Saunders Company 1912 This work handsome in typography and execution and containing over twelve hun dred biographies of prominent deceased Amer ican physicians written for the most part in cleancut style by various competent hands marks a distinct advance upon any of its predecessors in the same kind Of the earlier dictionaries of American medical biography those of Thacher 1828 and of the eminent surgeon S D Gross 1861 have a definite historic value but the separate lives are usually too long Thachers in particular being surcharged with that florid stilted spirit which as Dr Holmes wittily said 777 has chewed the juice out of all the superla tives in the language in Fourth of July ora tions  while the generousminded Gross in capable of saying anything unkind about his colleagues was perhaps lacking in a right critical sense for that very reason On the other hand the later worksthose of Atkin son 1878 Stone 1894 and Watson 1896 abound in shorter biographies but are in the main only directories of contemporary names Dr Kellys Cyclopedia strikes a happy balance between the extremes of florid en comium and mediocre choice consisting in the main of compact sketches of the lives of medical men who have  done things and is thus a genuine contribution to medical his tory Some of these worthies have described new diseases have introduced new drugs new operations or therapeutic procedures or have otherwise contributed to the elevation of American medicine as chemists botanists zoologists bibliophiles military and naval surgeons or leaders in hygienic and social movements The editors plan in getting up this work was twofold one group of his co workers took up the physicians who were of local importance as practitioners the other group took care of those who are of scientifiQ importance in relation to the specialties which they helped to advance Some of the former class might seem at first sight of little conse quence yet it will appear that as teachers or ganizers of schools and hospitals pioneers in hygiene whether in Canada Mississippi or the far west they have their place in the de velopment of earlier American medicine even though unknown in Berlin St Petersburg or Vienna Professor Horatio C Wood the wellknown therapeutist relates that he was once asked by an eminent European authority for a list of the professors of his specialty in America Upon receiving some forty or fifty names the astounded savant replied  In Gods name who are these people I never heard pf more than one or two of them Identical sensations are experienced in look ing over the pages of Hirschs Biograph isches

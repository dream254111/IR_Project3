vEY LANDDefendant by written contract agreed to convey real estate to X payment to be made in installments After X had made some payments an oral agreement was entered into whereby X surrendered the written con tract in consideration of defendant paying back the installments paid Plain tiff as administrator of X brought action demanding specific performance of the contract or damages Held the oral agreement rescinded the written agreement to convey land and that it was not such an agreement as under the Statute of Frauds would need to be in writing Wangsness v Stephenson S D 1921 184 N W 362 The general rule seems to be that if an executory contract is within the Statute of Frauds and is in writing a subsequent oral agreement to rescind the contract is effectual provided the oral agreement fulfills the requisites of a contract at common law WILLISTON ON CONTRACTS Sec 592 But whether an executory contract creates an interest in the land on the part of the buyer and whether a rescission of the contract is such a retransfer as to require a writing is a much disputed question The court in the prin cipal case follows a line of cases which holds that the oral agreement dis charging the written contract need not be in writing Morris v Baron 1918 A C I semble Wulschner v Ward 115 Ind 219 Howard v Gresham 27 Ga 347 Morrill v Colehour 82 Ill 6i8 But it seems that these courts fail to see that an equitable interest in the land has been created by the contract It is well settled that a promise to sell an equitable interest in real estate is within the statute Ellis v Hill 162 Ill 557 Sprague v Kimball 213 Mass 380 Tynan v Warren 53 N J Eq 313 Holmes v Holmes 86 N C 205 Thus a contract to mortgage real estate must be in writing Stringfellow v Ivie 73 Ala 209 Marshall v Livermore Water Co Cal 5 Pac IOI Clabaugh v Byerly 7 Gill Md 354 So also courts have held that an assignment of a contract to convey land must be in writing because it creates an equitable ownership in the purchaser Connor v Tip pett 57 Miss 594 Hackett v Watts 138 Mo 502 Meason v Kaine 63 Pa 335 In the principal case when the owner contracted to sell his land he parted with sufficient rights of ownership to be called an equitable interest in the land Therefore an oral rescission of the contract thereby restoring the equitable right to him who created it should be within the statute just the same as if the equitable right had been conveyed Barrett v Durbin Io6 Ark 332 Catlett v Dougherty 21 Ill App 116 Dial v Crain IO Tex 444 Grunow v Salter II8 Mich I48 See WILISTON ON CONTRACTS Sec 491 CORPORATIONSCHARTER AS A CONTRACT BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE CORPORATIONIn the year 1816 the Massachusetts legislature granted a char ter to a religious society by a special act reserving no power of repeal or amendment nor was there any general law in force at that time reserving to it that power In 1921 a bill was proposed in the legislature to suspend the charter of the society Upon its opinion beipg asked by the Senate the supreme court answered that the bill was in violation of Art I Sec IO of the United States Constitution which declares that no state shall    358RECENT IMPORTANT DECISIONS 359 pass any    law impairing the obligation of contracts The grant and acceptance of the charter constituted a contract between the commonwealth and the society which the former could not violate In re Opinion of the Justices Mass 1921 131 N E 29 This doctrine was laid down in Massachusetts as early as I806 in Wales v Stetson 2 Mass I43 But by far the leading case on the subject is Trus tees of Dartmouth College v Woodward I819 4 Wheat U S 518 I WILGUS CORP CASES 708 which Chief Justice Waite said had become so imbedded in our jurisprudence as to be to all intents and purposes part of the Constitution itself Stone v Mississippi IOI U S 814 2 WILGUS CORP CASES 1348 The doctrine however has not been free from attack See Toledo Bank v Bond I Ohio St 622 Dow v Northern Railroad 67 N H I When charters of private corporations were granted by special legislative acts as in the Dartmouth College case the grant could quite readily be inter preted as giving rise to a contract between the state and the corporation The act conferring corporate powers is in the nature of an offer on the part of the state which may be revoked at any time before acceptance State v Dawson I6 Ind 40 I WILoUS CORP CASES 412 Upon acceptance the implied agreement of the corporation to perform the duties imposed upon it is an adequate consideration and a binding contract is formed Now although corporations are formed under general laws this contract still arises Abbott v The Johnston etc Ry Co 80 N Y 27 In most states as in Massa chusetts R L 1902 c IO9 Sec 3 the power to repeal and amend is now reserved to the legislature by a general law It becomes a term of the char ters without reference to it of all corporations subsequently organized Thornton v Marginal Freight Ry Co 123 Mass 32 But the charter in the principal case was granted fifteen years before the Massachusetts statute became operative and a case is presented which is becoming more and more uncommon The decision shows no tendency on the part of the court to break away from the Dartmouth College case but to adhere strictly to its doctrine See also 4 MICH L JOUR 251 4 MICH L REV 306 7 ibid 64 201 591 9

persons to the grand jurors unknown Proffered evidence would have shown that some of the other persons were known to the grand jurors Held there was no error in the rejection of the evidence since no necessity exists for joining or naming all the conspirators in a single indictment United States v Heitler 274 Fed 401 A true averment that the names of the other conspirators are to the grand jury unknown has always been held sufficient People v Mather 4 Wend 229 Cooke v People 231 Ill 9 But furthermore it is never incum bent on the prosecution to charge all who have participated in the unlawful undertaking People v Richards 67 Cal 412 nor is it necessary to allege the names of all the parties to the conspiracy State v Lewis I42 N C 626

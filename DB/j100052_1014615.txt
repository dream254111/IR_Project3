J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1014615,CHINA OUR CHIEF FAR EAST PROBLEM,I242692,CHINA OUR CHIEF FAR EAST PROBLEM BY W W WILLOUGHBY PHD PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY W E ALL KNOW THAT THE CONFERENCE AT WASHINGTON1 WAS CALLED PRI MARILY TO REDUCE THE BUILDING OF ARMA MENTS BUT THAT OUR PRESIDENT THOUGHT IT ALSO NECESSARY IN THAT CONNECTION TO BRING ABOUT IF POSSIBLE AN ADJUSTMENT OF THE POLITICAL CONDITIONS IN THE FAR EAST WHICH IF NOT CORRECTED MIGHT LEAD TO WAR IN THE FUTURE THEREFORE HE IN VITED NOT SIMPLY THE FIRST FIVE POWERS THAT WERE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ARMS CONFERENCE BUT THE FOUR ADDITIONAL POWERS THAT HAD POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC INTERESTS IN THE PACIFIC AND FAR EAST I WISH TO SAY A WORD OR TWO AS TO THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN THE FAR EAST THE POLITICAL EQUATION THERE IS ONE OF THREE TERMS FIRST THERE IS CHINA WITH ITS VAST STRETCHES OF TERRITORY AND ITS GREAT POPULATION NUMBERING A QUARTER OF THE HUMAN RACE SECOND THERE IS JAPAN WITH ITS EAGER AGGRESSIVE AM BITIOUS AND INCREASING PEOPLE AND THIRD THERE ARE THE INTERESTS OF THE WESTERN POWERS CHINA UNDER FOREIGN CONTACT FIRST OF CHINA THE CHINESE PEO PLE AS HAS OFTEN BEEN SAID HAVE AN AU THENTIC HISTORY OF FOUR THOUSAND YEARS THEY ARE ONE OF THE GREATEST PEOPLES THAT HAVE LIVED ON THE GLOBE THEY HAVE CREATED FOR THEMSELVES A CIVILIZA TION THAT HAS BEEN THE ADMIRATION OF ALL THOSE WHO HAVE STUDIED IT THEY BUILT UP FOR THEMSELVES A CULTURE AN ART A SOCIAL LIFE AND A POLITY THAT WAS ADMIRABLY ADAPTED TO THEIR DOMINANT AGRICULTURAL NEEDS AND WHICH HAR MONIZED WITH THEIR SOCIAL LIFE A SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT WHICH PROVED DEFECTIVE ONLY WHEN BROUGHT INTO CONTACT WITH THE WESTERN INDUSTRIAL LIFE THUS IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT CHINA MAINTAINED HERSELF UNAIDED FOR FOUR THOUSAND YEARS BUT BEGAN TO FALL WHEN SHE BEGAN TO GET AID FROM THE WESTERN WORLD THERE IS MUCH TRUTH IN THIS FOR FROM THE TIME SHE WAS BROUGHT INTO CONTACT WITH THE WEST AND FORCED TO ACCEPT WESTERN IDEAS AND TO MEET THE MILITARY COMPETITION OF THE WESTERN NATIONS HER OWN SYSTEM OF POLITICAL RULE PROVED WEAK AND DEFEC TIVE THAT SYSTEM RELIED MORE ON REASON THAN ON FORCE IT HAD NOT THE APPLIANCES OF WESTERN MECHANICAL LIFE THUS THE WESTERN NATIONS WERE ABLE ONE AFTER ANOTHER TO TIE BONDS ABOUT CHINA UNTIL SHE BECAME ALMOST HELP LESS THUS IT HAS COME ABOUT THAT NEARLY ALL THE FOREIGNERS IN CHINA LIVE UNDER THEIR OWN LAWS AND ARE RESPON SIBLE TO THEIR OWN OFFICIALS IN MANY OF THE SOCALLED TREATY PORTS FOREIGNERS HAVE MUNICIPAL AREAS TERMED CONCESSIONS OR SETTLEMENTS WHERE THEY HAVE THEIR OWN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PRACTICALLY FREE FROM CHINESE ADMINIS TRATIVE CONTROL WHAT IS PERHAPS MOST SERIOUS OF ALL THE NATIONS HAVE DE PRIVED CHINA OF THE CONTROL OF HER OWN CUSTOMS REVENUES THEY HAVE MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR CHINA TO LEVY MORE THAN A FIVE PER CENT TAX ON ANY OF THE COMMODITIES IMPORTED INTO OR EX PORTED FROM CHINA SHE MUST GET THE UNANIMOUS CONSENT OF THE TREATY POWERS BEFORE SHE CAN INCREASE HER TARIFF THE TREATY ALLOWS HER FIVE PER CENT BUT SHE HAS BEEN ABLE TO COLLECT BECAUSE OF UNDERVALUATION OF COMMODI 1CONFERENCE ON LIMITATION OF ARMAMENT WASHINGTON NOVEMBER 11 1921 THIS PAPER WAS WRITTEN BEFORE THE CONFERENCE HAD COMPLETED ITS WORKEDITOR 837M38 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY TIES ONLY THREE TO THREE AND A HALF PER CENT AD VALOREM NOT CONTENT WITH RIGHTS WRUNG FROM CHINA BY MEANS OF TREATIES WHICH SHE HAS FELT HERSELF CONSTRAINED TO SIGN SOME OF THE POWERS HAVE EXERCISED RIGHTS AND POWERS IN CHINA WITHOUT EVEN THE SEMBLANCE OF TREATY PERMIS SION THEY HAVE STATIONED TROOPS AT VARIOUS POINTS IN CHINA JAPAN NOW HAS 1200 TO 1500 MEN AT HANKOW IN THE CENTER OF CHINA ONE THOUSAND MILES UP THE RIVER SHE HAS HAD THEM THERE FOR TEN YEARS THERE ARE MANY OTHER FOREIGNERS THERE BUT NONE OF THE OTHER NATIONS HAVE THOUGHT IT NECESSARY TO PROTECT THEIR NATIONALS BY STATIONING TROOPS SOME OF THE NATIONS HAVE ESTABLISHED WIRELESS STATIONS WITHOUT TREATY RIGHT IN PEKING I COULD PUT A LETTER IN A FOREIGN POST OFFICE AND SEND IT ANYWHERE ALL THOSE POST OFFICES ARE THERE WITHOUT ANY TREATY RIGHT THE NEW REPUBLIC IN 1911 CHINA STARTED UPON THE GREAT EXPERIMENT OF A REPUBLIC TO REPLACE THE FORTYCENTURIESOLD MON ARCHY THE RESULT OF SUCH A TRANSITION NECESSARILY BROUGHT ABOUT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DISCONTENT AND A TEMPORARY WEAKENING OF AUTHORITY BUT A RE PUBLIC REQUIRES FOR ITS SUPPORT THE LOYAL ACTIVE OBEDIENCE AND SYMPATHY OF ITS OWN PEOPLE AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO HAVE THAT RESPECT FOR A GOVERNMENT WHICH IS TREATED AS THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN TREATED BY OTHER NATIONS THIS THE WESTERN POWERS HAVE NOW RECOGNIZED THEY NOW SEE THAT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS OF THE FAR EAST IS TO REHABILITATE CHINA TO AID HER TO ESTABLISH AN ORDERLY GOVERNMENT THIS IS WHAT THE CONFERENCE AT WASHINGTON IS TRYING TO DO IT HAS MADE PROVISION FOR GETTING RID OF ALL THE FOREIGN POST OFFICES THEY WILL BE REMOVED BY THE END OF THIS YEAR CHINA HAS GOT VERY LITTLE WITH REFERENCE TO TARIFF LEGISLATION SHE IS ALLOWED TO LEVY AN EFFECTIVE FIVE PER CENT BUT THAT IS ONLY WHAT THE TREATIES HAVE ALLOWED HER AND THAT SHE WILL NOT GET FOR SOME TIME THE QUESTION OF THE RIGHT WHICH ALL FOREIGNERS NOW HAVE TO LIVE UNDER THEIR OWN LAWS AND BE RESPONSIBLE ONLY TO THEIR OWN OFFICIALS IS ALSO IM PORTANT THE CONFERENCE HAS PROVIDED THAT THERE SHALL BE A COMMITTEE AP POINTED TO INVESTIGATE CONDITIONS IN CHINA WITH A VIEW TO DETERMINING HOW SOON AND BY WHAT STEPS THIS CONDITION OF AFFAIRS CAN BE RELIEVED AND CHINA THUS MADE THE MISTRESS OF HER OWN AFFAIRS WHILE I AM SPEAKING OF FOREIGNERS I SHOULD SAY THERE IS NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHERE FOREIGNERS ARE SO SAFE BOTH AS TO LIFE AND PROPERTY AS THEY ARE IN CHINA THE JAPANESE MENACE NOT ONLY ARE CHINAS AUTONOMOUS POWERS LIMITED IN THE MANNER IN WHICH I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING BUT HER VERY POLITICAL EXISTENCE IS THREATENED RUSSIA WAS CERTAINLY A THREATENING MENACE TO HER AT ONE TIME BUT SINCE 1905 THE MENACE HAS BEEN FROM JAPANA SMALL BUT AGGRESSIVE POWER MILITARISTIC BUREAUCRATIC AND IMPERIAL ISTIC YOU ALL KNOW THE HISTORY OF JAPAN AND KOREAHOW JAPAN TOOK KOREA UNDER HER PROTECTION AND IN FIVE YEARS ANNEXED HER I DO NOT NEED TO SPEAK TO YOU OF HOW SHE TOOK THE PLACE OF RUSSIA IN MANCHURIA HOW THROUGH THE CONTROL OF THE SOUTH MANCHURIAN RAILROAD SHE HAS CLAIMED THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN POLICE TO MAINTAIN TROOPS WHO EXERCISE POLITICAL JURISDICTION AND IN OTHER WAYS TO EXERCISE A DOMINATING INFLUENCE IN THE GREAT MANCHURIAN PROVINCES WITH TWENTY MILLIONS OF POPULATION I DO NOT NEED TO MENTION TO YOU THE NOW FAMOUS OR INFAMOUS TWENTYONE DEMANDS WHICH JAPAN PUT FORWARDCHINA OUR CHIEF FAR EAST PROBLEM 939 IN 1915 THE CHIEF QUESTION WHICH IS STILL BEFORE THE CONFERENCE IS WHAT RELIEF IS CHINA TO GET FROM THOSE DE MANDS AND WHAT ASSURANCE ARE THE OTHER POWERS TO GET BECAUSE AFTER ALL THE MOST IMPORTANT POLITICAL ELE MENT IN THE FAR EAST IS THIS PENETRA TION THIS MILITARY AND POLITICAL PENE TRATION OF JAPAN INTO EASTERN ASIA JAPAN MAKES CLAIM TO A SORT OF PREFER ENTIAL RIGHT IN THOSE REGIONS SHE CALLS IT SPECIAL INTERESTS GIVING TO THIS TERM A DEFINITION DIFFERENT FROM THAT WHICH OUR GOVERNMENT HAS GIVEN IT SO LONG AS JAPAN CLAIMS THIS SPECIAL INDEFINITE VAGUE RIGHT SHE CAN GO INTO ASIA TO TAKE WHAT SHE NEEDS AND THIS IS TO MY MIND THE POINT THAT IS MOST LIKELY TO PROVOKE FUTURE TROUBLE IN THE FAR EAST IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE CONFERENCE WILL FALL FAR SHORT OF THE GOAL WHICH IT HAS BEEN STRIVING TO REACH UNLESS IT CAN CLEAR UP THIS SITUATION THE NATIONS SHOULD SAY TO JAPAN DO YOU CLAIM SPECIAL RIGHTS IN THOSE COUNTRIES AND WHAT ARE THOSE RIGHTS WHAT SPE CIFICALLY IS IT YOU CLAIM TO HAVE BY SPECIAL RIGHT IN EASTERN ASIA THE QUESTION OF SHANTUNG FINALLY THERE IS THE QUESTION OF SHANTUNG WHEN JAPAN DECLARED WAR AGAINST GERMANY SHE CLAIMED THE RIGHT TO ATTACK THE GERMANLEASED AREA OF KIAOCHOW CHINA WAS THEN A NEUTRAL BUT HER GOVERNMENT DESIG NATED A REGION AROUND AND OUTSIDE OF THE LEASED AREA AND SAID TO THE JAPANESE YOU CAN CONDUCT MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THAT REGION BUT INSTEAD OF THAT JAPAN LANDED TROOPS FAR AWAY FROM THAT REGION AND IMMEDIATELY TOOK POSSESSION OF THE RAILROAD RUNNING 265 MILES FROM TSINTAO TO TSINANFU THE CAPITAL OF THE PROVINCE THIS WAS DONE IT WILL BE REMEMBERED IN THE TERRITORY OF A FRIENDLY POWER NO MILITARY NECESSITY FOR THIS ACTION EX ISTED BUT JAPAN HAS BEEN IN POSSESSION OF THE RAILWAY EVER SINCE NATURALLY THE CHINESE HAVE LOOKED ON THIS AS A MERE MILITARY OCCUPATION WHICH THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PREVENT BUT WHICH HAS GIVEN TO THE JAPANESE NO EQUITABLE OR LEGAL TITLE THUS IT WAS THAT THE CHINESE SAID THEY COULD NOT ENTER INTO DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE JAPANESE IN REGARD TO THAT SITUATION THEREFORE IN WASHINGTON MR HUGHES AND MR BALFOUR OFFERED THEIR GOOD OFFICES TO THE JAPANESE DELEGATION AND TO THE CHINESE DELEGA TION TO CAUSE THEM TO COME TOGETHER IN INFORMAL CONVERSATIONS WHICH WOULD NOT RAISE THE QUESTION OF LEGAL RIGHTS BUT WHICH WOULD APPROACH THE SITUA TION AS A DE FACTO ONE AND SEE IF SOME AGREEMENT COULD NOT BE REACHED THERE HAVE NOW BEEN SOME TWENTYFIVE OF THESE DISCUSSIONS THEY HAVE DIS POSED OF A GOOD MANY MATTERS THERE WERE A GREAT MANY QUESTIONS AS TO WHAT SHOULD BE DONE WITH THE VARIOUS KINDS OF PUBLIC PROPERTIES AND THE MODE OF VALUING THEM WHEN IT CAME TO THE QUESTION OF RAILROADS JAPAN DECLARED YES WE WILL GIVE YOU BACK THE RAILROAD IF YOU WILL PAY US FOR IT AND CHINA SAID SHE WOULD PAY THE ENTIRE ASSESSED VALUE OF THE RAILROAD WITH ALL ITS AP PURTENANT PROPERTIES HOW WILL YOU PAY IT ASKED JAPAN AND CHINA ANSWERED WE WILL PAY IT IN CASH IN A LUMP CASH SUM BUT JAPAN SAID SHE DID NOT WANT THAT THEN THE CHINESE OFFERED TO PAY IT BY DEFERRED PAYMENTS RUNNING OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS THAT AGAIN WAS NOT SATISFACTORY IT FINALLY APPEARED THAT WHAT JAPAN PARTICULARLY WANTED WAS TO KEEP CONTROL OF THE OPERATION OF THE RAILROAD FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS THAT IS SHE WANTED THE CHIEF ENGINEER THE CHIEF ACCOUNTANT AND THE TRAFFIC MANAGER TO BE JAPANESE WHAT THE OUTCOME IS TO BE NO ONE CAN SAY240 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY HOPE IN THE WASHINGTON CONFERENCE IT WAS NOT BY ACCIDENT OR COURTESY THAT CHINA WAS ASKED TO OPEN THE WORK OF THE CONFERENCE DEALING WITH THE FAR EAST IT WAS BECAUSE IN HER FUTURE IS BOUND UP THE POLITICAL FUTURE OF THE FAR EAST AND THEREFORE UNLESS THE WASHINGTON CONFERENCE CAN TAKE OFF ENOUGH OF THE BONDS FROM CHINA IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SECOND OF THE SOCALLED ROOT RESOLUTIONS TO GIVE HER AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP FOR HERSELF STABLE INSTITUTIONS UNLESS THEY CAN TAKE THE TROOPS OUT OF CHINA UN LESS THEY CAN GIVE HER SOME GREATER DEGREE OF SECURITY AND OF FINANCIAL AUTONOMY AND THUS ENABLE HER TO BECOME A STRONG PROSPEROUS CENTRAL STATE THE CONFERENCE WILL CERTAINLY FAIL TO ACHIEVE ITS PURPOSE IF CHINA IS GIVEN THAT OPPORTUNITY I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT SHE CAN BY HER OWN EFFORT BRING ABOUT THIS DESIRED CONDITION

j100358,The School Review,1077272,The Value of the Study of Greek and Latin as a Preparation for the Study of Science,i244616,THE SCHOOL REVIEW he must have the power to think straight and to give forceful utterance to his thought For the man that seeks to be a leader in the practical life of the world the study of the Humanities of Greek and Latin is to be recommended and urged therefore because of the thorough understanding and mastery of English that it gives because of the discipline of the intellectual powers it affords in determining the precise meaning of an authors discourse because of the knowledge gained of the sources of our own language our insti tutions and our culture because of the cultivation of taste that comes thereby in all that is high and fine in literature and art because of the wider vision it gives to the spirit of men and because it deepens ones sense of the continuity of culture of the solidarity of the race of our debt to the past and so of our obli gation to the future It makes a man more a man the more he knows of what men aforetime have borne and done and thought The most practical man in the final survey of human life is the one that puts the emphasis on man and not on practical who is never too absorbed in the cares and triumphs of life to ask him self soberly now and then What shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul  IV THE VALUE OF THE STUDY OF GREEK AND LATIN AS A PREPARATION FOR THE STUDY OF SCIENCE HARVEY W WILEY Chief of the Bureau of Chemistry Washington D C In this twentieth century when the world is full of men of affairs when so much is accomplished in a material sense when the intellectual power of certain men over their fellowmen is so marked when our leaders are of such consequence it is a matter of interest to study every phase of the training of young people for they will be responsible for the progress we shall make in the future All of us teachers and students workers in every line are striving to make our work tell in the final result and not one of us is willing that the precious time of the youth of this generation should be spent on studies that give no 390CLASSICAL STUDIES FOR MEN OF AFFAIRS value received at all commensurate with the time spent upon them In the general education which all of us agree should precede the study of the science art or profession which is to be a persons life work such good and broad foundations should be laid that later in life no trained man shall feel that his early train ing has been essentially defective That much at least we older men owe to those coming after us for we are supposed to have learned by our experience as working members of this busy world what parts of our education have given us the best train ing for the things we may have accomplished To estimate the value of the study of Greek and Latin as a preparation for the study of science it is well to know what is thought on the subject by men of eminence in the various branches of science If the matter is passed upon by chemists only the conclusions to be drawn from opinions rendered would be very different from those to be drawn from the opinions of astronomers exclusively As a member of the Committee of Nine of the Classical Asso ciation of the Middle West and South I sent a circular letter to one hundred prominent scientific men in the United States teachers and others for the purpose of eliciting information respecting their attitude toward the promotion of classical learn ing and their estimation of its value This letter is in part as follows I particularly desire to present the matter of classical studies to the scientific men of this country with a view to securing more extended study of the classics as a basis for scientific studies The great tendency in the past few years has been to eliminate any requirement of classical knowl edge from courses in science I hope that a careful study of these problems will lead to the return at least in part to former conditions of qualification I feel deeply that a man who proposes to follow a scientific pursuit especially should be well trained in both Latin and Greek I do not mean that he should become a specialist but that he should have such a knowl edge of these languages as will enable him to appreciate their beauty and utility I desire to have your views on the following points I What value do you place upon a fair knowledge of the classical languages especially Latin and Greek as a basis for scientific studies and activity  39ITHE SCHOOL REVIEW 2 What practical utility may such a knowledge of the classical lan guages be to a scientific man in the active work of his profession 3 What particular branches of science would be most

the scientific man who is required to learn some modern language in addition to his own 6 What effect will such a knowledge of the classics have upon the pleasures arising from knowledge rather than its application which may be enjoyed by an active educated man 7 At what age in a persons training should the knowledge of the classics above referred to be acquired or the acquirement commenced 8

followed  I Some knowledge of Latin and Greek is of benefit in making English scientific terms intelligible 4 Latin is of great value in obtaining a knowledge of the proper use of English so necessary to any educated man  2 A student of Latin and Greek really learns syntax while he is studying Latin and Greek He could do this equally well by studying a modern language and better still by analyzing English authors  The value of Latin and Greek is the resulting acquaint ance with English etymology  I Severe attention to detail which the thorough study of Latin and Greek requires is of value but strictly scientific studies might give the same result  I The nomenclature and terminology of science are based on Latin and Greek hence knowledge of them is very important to a scientific man  8

knowledge rather than its application which may be enjoyed by an active educated man No specific reply Io All knowledge gives pleasure there is no special pleasure to be obtained from Latin and Greek classics 5 Much more pleasure is found in the great works in modern languages than in the classics in Greek and Latin  5 394CLASSICAL STUDIES FOR MEN OF AFFAIRS A source of great pleasure  9 A source

schools have given a very large part of their time to Latin and Greek Of course the graduates of these schools are better trained than those of poor schools with better programmes  I Advantageous effect on a mans reading writing and speaking  2 Effect of drill in careful use of language  Other things being equal the botanist with a good classi cal education is more likely to succeed because he is less dependent upon others for certain essentials in his science such as etymologies of words transla tion of Latin descriptions and writing Latin descrip tions  A man becomes a better popularizer of science  Classical knowledge is of much value for the success of a scientific man  4 I select some typical replies to Question 9 giving them in full since in many cases the attitude of the writer to the whole 395THE SCHOOL REVIEW subject under discussion is most clearly shown in his reply to that question J M BALDWIN JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY I think the attempt to continue socalled classical study in its tradi tional artificial position is quite useless and unwise Let it take a place it can holdone in common with other literary and linguistic groups of studies To give it great importance in connection with science is a conceit me judice of its fosterparents R P BIGELOW MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY To summarize my opinions in the matter of scientific education it seems to me that the essentials are of two classes First a thorough training in the use of the tools required by a scientific man namely the modern languages and mathematics second a training in the scientific method especially as applied to the branch of science in which he desires to specialize If to the curriculum the study of the classics can be added without interfering with these essentials then it seems to me that in some cases it would be desirable as a means of culture and enjoyment M T BOGERT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY No reason for a scientific man to go beyond Caesar and Xenophon Much more important for a chemist to be familiar with German than Latin and Italian French or Danish than Greek In fact I would place the languages in about the following order for an organic chemist German English French Italian Danish Swedish Latin Greek Russian G C COMSTOCK WASHBURN OBSERVATORY UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN The value of the classical languages and their study appears mainly to result from the drill and mental exercise upon a host of constantly recur ring small problems and the applications of flexible rules which the diligent student cannot escape and which are especially adapted to the discipline of immature minds The initial stages of such study appear to me of much more value for general training than anything which can come after the first three or four years of such work J U NEF THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO I think everyone realizes as he grows older that he has his limitations I for one regret very keenly that I took a great deal of Latin and Greek and did not spend far more time on advanced mathematics and physics I am however not now wasting any time in vain or useless regrets on this account but simply doing the best I can with the knowledge that I have acquired ORMOND STONE LEANDER MCCORMICK OBSERVATORY UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA The tendency to eliminate classics as required subjects from courses in science is pedagogically correct Life is too short for everything 396CLASSICAL STUDIES FOR MEN OF AFFAIRS Modern languages at least German and French are essential to the Englishspeaking man of science W F OSGOOD HARVARD UNIVERSITY I value linguistic training and I believe that for the Englishspeaking person German offers all the advantages of Latinnot German crowded into a corner with Latin five hours a week for four school years but German taught by the ear and by the eye with thorough schooling in grammar and reinforced a year or two after the start by French similarly taught both languages strengthening each other through their comparative study From such a study come the advantages first of the discipline of the exact knowledge and the intelligent performance of a task well under stood second of the broadening influence of wider human contact through really seeing something of the thought of other peoples and third of having in our possession a useful tool for our science C R BARNES THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO While I should advise every young man who is going to make a special study of some branch of science to study both Latin and Greek I should greatly deplore requiring either I do not think it possible to run every scientific intellect into the same preparatory mold FLORIAN CAJORI COLORADO COLLEGE Modern languages are indispensable I have seen scientific men who could read their Virgil but to whom a German book was a sealed book Their scientific work was seriously hampered C W DABNEY UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI I do not know how a man can understand the terminology of science much less keep up with its literature unless he has a full knowledge of the classical languages The scientific man must be able at a glance to know the meaning of all the terms used in science and I do not see how he can do this unless he has a moderate knowledge of Latin and Greek He needs French and German to keep up with their literature and those languages are in part based on the classical languages E S DANA YALE UNIVERSITY I may say in general that my experience has shown that a knowledge of Latin and Greek is of great benefit to the scientific man particularly in natural history since without this he is ignorant in regard to the meanings of a considerable part of the scientific vocabulary and if his work requires him to invent new specific names he has not the basis of knowledge to allow him doing this intelligently Furthermore the drill in Latin and Greek translations seems to me one of the best ways of studying the English language and thus training the individual in a clear style J W MALLET UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA But in a broader way such a one may well desire to have his share with his fellowmen in the mental strength and enjoyment which a moderate 397THE SCHOOL REVIEW acquaintance with these tongues opens up in history in literature in art and generally in a knowledge of the mental life of the chief races of men who have before us inhabited the earth In the selection of subjects with which to fill the time and thoughts of the young during the part of life which can be given to formal training there must of necessity be close instruction within practically attainable limits and the teacher must con stantly keep before him the problem of what best may be left out but in the socalled conflict between classical and scientific studies it may I think be truly said This should ye have done and not have left the other undone B OSGOOD PEIRCE HARVARD UNIVERSITY I do not regret the years that I spent in school and college not very willingly at the time upon Latin and Greek EDWARD RENOUF JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY Every scientific man knows what a dismal farce the result of classical instruction in the American preparatory school is and I do not think it possible for classical instruction to scientific students to be prolonged beyond the second college year The result obtained at that period with the material the teachers have to handle is still pitiable and to my mind of little value especially if it has lessened as is usually the case the time allotted to modern language I cannot but feel that it is up to the teachers of classics Scientific teachers starting with a freshmanabout equivalent to entrance into OberSecunda of the Gymnasiumturn out an average undergraduate product which compares favorably with that turned out in German universities in the same working time from RealGymnasium graduates Why cannot the preparatory school teaching Latin to boys from 12 to I8 equal or at least approach the product produced between 12 and 17 by the classical Gymnasia When they do the questions on this sheet will not be neededthe man with classical training will be the only man who will be practically received as university or college teacher in science as it is practically in Germany today C O WHITMAN UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO I have long held that a good knowledge of Latin and Greek is quite essential to the modern man of science In my own department the ablest men are without an exception men who have had a thorough classical training Those who have failed of this show it in inability to express themselves accurately and concisely They do not have a fine appreciation of the primary meanings of words  The scientific man must not only know how to use English but also how to form new words for new purposes Besides his terminology is made up almost wholly of Latin and Greek derivatives Over half of our whole vocabulary is founded on Latin A knowledge of Latin aids immensely also in the learning of French Italian Spanish etc 398CLASSICAL STUDIES FOR MEN OF AFFAIRS The replies to the circular letter have been difficult to classify considering each one as a whole Examination of a letter often showed that different parts of it should be classified under differ ent heads I have endeavored however to separate them into two classes First those which upon the whole favor classical instruction and second those which upon the whole oppose classical instruction but even with this clearcut line of demarca tion it has been found impossible to make a just distribution in all cases Some of those which are found in class I will contain sections which should be placed in class 2 or vice versa The most prominent deduction from a study of the replies is the existence of two schools of thought based upon different premises or points of view In the one instance there is quite a respectable element among scientific workers and teachers favor ing decidedly or in a limited manner the requirement of classical instruction for the college degrees This school believes as will be seen in the detailed analyses given that classical studies upon the whole are advantageous to those engaged in scientific work and also contribute to the enjoyment of scientific life On the other hand we may class those who are of the very positive opinion that all the time spent in learning dead languages especially Latin and Greek is wasted and that the knowledge which the ordinary student obtains of these languages is not a working knowledge nor is it of sufficient extent to warrant the belief that it adds anything to the pleasure or to the efficiency of those engaged in scientific pursuits That such a difference of view would be secured was clearly foreseen The surprise that has come to me in studying the replies I have received was pro duced rather by the large amount of testimony in favor of the classics than by that which is opposed to thein In general I think it may be conceded that in so far as actual utility is con cerned in scientific research itself a knowledge of the classical languages is not of any very great importance On the other hand in so far as nomenclature of science is concerned especially biological science a knowledge of Greek and Latin is almost indispensable Moreover it seems to me there is a decided opinion to the effect that a knowledge of the classics is more or 399THE SCHOOL REVIEW less indispensable to one who claims to be a man of culture and education in the broadest acceptation of those terms In regard to the period at which classical studies should begin the preponderating testimony is in favor of an early commence ment In other words it is the opinion of most of those who have expressed any conviction at all upon the subject that a good knowledge of classical studies should be acquired during or even before the schooling which is designed to fit the young man to enter the freshman class of a good college or university There is a very decided preponderance of opinion to the effect that the time of the more mature studies that is of the last three years of the college course and practically the whole of the technical courses in scientific studies should be free from any special devotion to classical researches I may cite as a typical advocate of classical learning the letter received from Professor Bessey of the University of Nebraska He states in part In the management of the department of botany in the University of Nebraska I require a knowledge of Latin at least by those who take up the serious study of botany and I urge such persons to have some knowl edge of Greek also The botanist must know something of Latin and he should know something of Greek also One young man who came to me a number of years ago with a preparation in modern languages only soon became so convinced of the necessity of a knowledge of Latin and Greek that after entering the University he went back to the beginning of Latin and brought up his knowledge of this language so that he became a critical Latin scholar He did the same with Greek and always defended his action on the ground of its being necessary for him in his botanical work He is now one of the eminent botanists of the country As a typical illustration of the attitude of those opposed to classical learning I may give the letter received from Professor Carl Barus of Brown University It seems to me little short of ludicrous that anybody at the present age of progress should make an endeavor to reintroduce classical philology particularly at a time when at such venerable seats of learning as Oxford and Cambridge determined efforts have been made to get rid of this incubus How is it possible for anybody to fail to realize that the trend of science is ever toward mathematics that in the next generation the demand for a mathematical equipment and the need of it will be increased 400CLASSICAL STUDIES FOR MEN OF AFFAIRS tenfold How is it possible to ignore the fact that this is the direction in which specialization should be made beginning at an early age for the burden is continually heavier and that this is precisely the direction in which nothing is being done As for philological work let us have English French German Italian etc which not only have the same cultural value but open to their possessors a world of life and learning and science I cant answer your questions for they put me in a temper These two letters plainly join the battle between the opposing forces and in neither of them is there any uncertain sound Professor McKee of Lake Forest College sent a most inter esting letter He states that he is distinctly convinced from experiments he has made that classical studies are a positive disadvantage to scientific students He finds that students who have come with a knowledge of Latin rather than with a knowl edge of German do not rank as high as those who have studied German This is not a mere opinion but is based upon actual data of the examinations of college students Professor Branner of Leland Stanford Jr University does not agree with Professor McKee He says I believe that a systematic examination of the records would show that the men who have the most enduring reputations in the science I know most about are men who have more or less training in the classics This may well be true since the men who have enduring repu tations are older men and the older men were educated at a time when classical training was required and not made optional as it is at the present time Even however should the records of scientific men show in the future that those who have acquired dis tinction in sciences are those who have had no classical training it would not be a proof of the lack of value of classical culture It is well known that the taste for scientific studies often develops early in life to such an extent as to exclude all desire for the study of any languages except those necessary to scientific read ing and research Hence it would happen that men with a natural bent for scientific studies would naturally omit the study of classical languages when such a study was not required for college graduation Upon the whole it seems to me that the class of data submitted by Professor McKee is likely to be the most reliable Unfortunately for my own personal 40ITHE SCHOOL REVIEW views in the matter the results of his observations seem to be distinctly unfavorable to the classical scholar I should not however like to rest content with this one instance but should like to see it supplemented by others If we think for a moment of the vast number of distinguished men who have already made their mark in science and recall the fact that practically all of them were well trained in the classics we would hardly be able to condemn classical studies on the ground that they are positively injurious as is claimed by many of those who have responded to my inquiries My own opinion partly formed I must say before receiving the replies to my circular letter though somewhat accentuated by reason of these replies is that it would be a very serious mistake to omit from the higher learning of the United States instruction in classical studies I believe on the other hand that more attention should be paid to these studies as was the case forty years ago when it was deemed not possible to have a liberal culture without a knowledge of Latin I believe that most of the objections to classical studies made by those who have responded to my inquiries would be removed if these studies were begun at an earlier age I am led to believe after many years of careful consideration of the subject and as a result of four years of teaching the classics to young college students and as the result of six years of instruction in the classics received from very competent teachers that the failure to reach the full value of classical instruction lies essentially in the fact that this instruction is attempted at the wrong time and to a certain extent in the wrong manner The general practice in this country is to defer classical studies until the time a young man begins to prepare for college While there are many notable exceptions to this exceptions that are by the way the strongest evidence of the pertinence of these remarks I think it may be demonstrated that four years of classical study beginning at the age of sixteen as a rule would produce no more mastery of these studies than would two or three years of study if commenced at the age of ten or twelve Youth is the natural period for learn ing a language In extreme youth the brain may be regarded as 402CLASSICAL STUDIES FOR MEN OF AFFAIRS 403 almost unwritten upon and the sensations which it registers most indelibly are those which pertain to language If the brain may be regarded as a palimpsest I think we will all agree that the first inscriptions upon it should be those of language Mathe matics and science and philosophy can be written over words with good effect but if you try to write a language over the other inscriptions you will have but little success

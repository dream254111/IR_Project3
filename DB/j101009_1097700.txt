HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION AS A HOUSEHOLDER OR HEAD OF A FAMILY AS PRO VIDED BY THE CONSTITUTION AND LAWS OF VIRGINIA NO QUESTION OF PRO CEDURE IS INVOLVED AS TO WHETHER THE BANKRUPT HAD PROPERLY SET UP A CLAIM FOR THE EXEMPTION SECTION 6 OF THE BANKRUPTCY ACT APPROVED JULY 1 1898 PRO VIDES 1900 5276 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER THIS ACT SHALL NOT AFFECT THE ALLOWANCE TO BANKRUPTS OF THE EXEMPTIONS WHICH ARE PRESCRIBED BY THE STATE LAWS IN FORCE AT THE TIME OF THE FILING OF THE PETITION IN THE STATE WHEREIN THEY HAVE HAD THEIR DOMICILE FOR THE SIX MONTHS OR THE GREATER PORTION THEREOF IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE FILING OF THE PETITION THE INTENTION WAS TO ADOPT THE STATE LAWS GOVERNING EXEMPTIONS HENCE THE COURTS OF BANKRUPTCY WILL LOOK TO AND BE GOVERNED BY THE CONSTITUTIONS STATUTES AND DECISIONS OF THE SEVERAL STATES AND TERRI TORIES IN DECIDING WHO IS ENTITLED TO EXEMPTIONS AND THE AMOUNT AND SPECIES OF PROPERTY TO BE EXEMPT A BANKRUPT IS ENTITLED TO THE SAME EXEMPTIONS AS IF PROCEEDED AGAINST AS A DEBTOR UNDER THE STATE LAW AND NONE OTHER SHALL NOT AFFECT MEANS SHALL NOT ENLARGE OR DIMINISH IN DETERMINING THESE EXEMPTIONS THE BANKRUPT COURTS WILL FOLLOW THE CONSTRUCTION GIVEN THE STATE LAWS BY THE HIGHEST COURTS OF THE STATE THE STATUTE OF WHICH IS INVOLVED THE DECISIONS TO THIS EFFECT ARE NU MEROUS AND UNIFORM BUT WHERE THERE IS NO CONSTRUCTION OF A STATE LAW BY THE STATE COURTS OR THERE IS A CONFLICT OF CONSTRUCTION AND A PROPER CASE IS PRESENTED INVOLVING A CONSTRUCTION OF STATE CONSTITUTIONS OR STATUTES THE COURT OF BANKRUPTCY WILL AS OTHER COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES DO GIVE IT A CONSTRUCTION TO CARRY OUT THE PURPORT AND INTENT OF THE ACT OF CONGRESS AND SECTION 2 SS 11 PROVIDES THE COURTS OF BANK RUPTCY SHALL DETERMINE ALL THE CLAIMS OF BANKRUPTS TO

APPEARS WAS ADMITTED IN THE ARGUMENT AND IS STATED BY THE DISTRICT JUDGE THAT THE COURTS OF VIRGINIA HAVE NOT CONSIDERED OR DECIDED THE QUESTION INVOLVED IN THE CASE AT BAR THESE COURTS HAVE CONSTRUED THE CONSTITUTION AND STATUTES REFERRED TO BUT NOT AS BEARING UPON OR INVOLVED IN THIS QUESTION OF HOMESTEAD EXEMPTIONS HAD THEY DONE SO THIS COURT WOULD FOLLOW THEIR INTERPRETATION IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH DECISIONS THIS COURT MUST DETERMINE THE CLAIM OF THE BANKRUPT TO EXEMPTIONS NOT UPON ANY SUPPOSITION OF HOW THE STATE COURTS WOULD PROBABLY DECIDE BUT ACCORDING TO ESTABLISHED RULES OF CONSTRUC TION THE HUSBAND DOES NOT CLAIM THE HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION THE POOR DEBTORS EXEMPTION OF SPECIFIC ARTICLES OF PERSONAL PROPERTY WHICH HE HAS CLAIMED IS PROVIDED FOR IN A DIFFERENT STATUTE AND CAN IN NO WAY AFFECT A DECISION OF THE QUESTION UNDER CONSIDERATION THAT IS A PER SONAL PROPERTY EXEMPTION PERSONAL TO THE DEBTOR IT IS FOUNDED ON A DIFFERENT POLICY 528 DECRICHARDSON V WOODWARD THE GENERAL RULE IS EXEMPTION LAWS SHOULD BE LIBERALLY CONSTRUED THE CONSTITUTION OF VIRGINIA ART 11 SEC 7 EMPHASIZES THE RULE AND MAKES IT MORE SPECIFIC BY PROVIDING  THE PROVISIONS OF THIS ARTICLE SHALL BE

THE ACTS OF ASSEMBLY IN PURSUANCE THEREOF ALL THE INTENTS  TO BE FULLY AND PERFECTLY CARRIED OUT  HOMESTEAD LAWS ARE ENACTED AS A MATTER OF PUBLIC POLICY IN THE INTEREST OF HUMANITY THAT THOUGH A CITIZEN MAY BE OVERTAKEN BY REVERSES OF FORTUNE HE AND THOSE OF HIS HOUSEHOLD SHALL NOT BE HOME LESS WITHOUT SHELTER RAIMENT AND FOOD THE DEBTORS PRISON AND ATTENDANT EVILS MEET WITH LITTLE FAVOR IN MODERN LEGISLATION THE POLICY OF THE LAW IS THAT FAMILIES SHALL NOT BE DEPRIVED OF SHELTER AND REASONABLE COMFORTS THE STATE IS CONCERNED THAT THE CITIZEN SHALL NOT BE DIVESTED OF THE MEANS OF SUPPORT AND REDUCED TO PAUPERISM THOMP SON ON HOMESTEADS PAGE 1 WAPLES ON HOMESTEAD PAGES 34 AND CASES CITED THE EXEMPTION IS INTENDED FOR THE FAMILY THE DECIS IONS IN VIRGINIA DO NOT CONTROVERT OR DIFFER

CONSTITUTION AND THE ADJUDI CATED CASES OF OTHER STATES AND FAIL TO SEE THAT THE PRIMARY OBJECT IS TO PROVIDE FOR THE FAMILY THIS POLICY IS WELL STATED IN WAPLES ON HOMESTEAD AT PAGE 4 THE CONSERVATION OF FAMILY HOMES IS THE PURPOSE OF HOMESTEAD LEGISLATION THE POLICY OF THE STATE IS TO FOSTER FAMILY HOMES AS THE FACTORS OF SOCIETY AND THUS PROMOTE THE GENERAL GOOD TO SAVE THEM FROM

HOMESTEAD IS INTENDED FOR THE FAMILY IT IS NOT A POOR LAW ARTICLE 11 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF VIRGINIA SECURES IN ADDITION TO THE ARTICLES NOW EXEMPT ETC THOSE CLAIMED BY THE HUSBAND TO EVERY 529 19006

MIGHT THEREFORE BE READ EVERY HOUSEHOLDER WHO IS THE HEAD OF A FAMILY WHICH IN THE LIGHT OF THE DECISIONS SEEMS TO BE A PROPER PARAPHRASE OF THE LANGUAGE THE HUSBAND COULD NOT CLAIM THE EXEMPTION THE TITLE IS IN THE WIFE AND HE IS NOT THE HOUSEHOLDER IF THEN THE WIFE CANNOT CLAIM IT THE PRIMARY OBJECT OF THE CONSTITUTION AS STATED BY JUDGE STAPLES TO SECURE A HOMESTEAD FOR THE FAMILY IS DEFEATED AND THE PROVISION OF SECTION 7 ARTICLE 11 OF THE CONSTITUTION IS INOPERA TIVE THE ARTICLE IS NOT LIBERALLY CONSTRUED TO THE END THAT ALL THE INTENTS THEREOF MAY BE FULLY AND PERFECTLY CARRIED OUT THE HUSBAND IS GENERALLY AND FOR MANY PURPOSES THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY HE OWES IT AS A MORAL DUTY TO SUPPORT HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN A FAILURE TO DO SO IS IN MANY JURISDICTIONS MADE A CRIME HE MAY SAY WHERE THEY SHALL RESIDE BUT THE HOME PROVIDED MUST BE SUITABLE OR THE WIFE WOULD BE JUSTIFIED IN LEAVING HIM IF THE PLACE IS NOT SUITABLE HUTCHINS V HUTCHINS 93 VA 71 THIS WAS A DIVORCE CASE AND IN NO WAY INVOLVED THE QUESTION OF HOMESTEAD THE RECORDS OF THE COURTS SHOW THAT HUSBANDS DO NOT ALWAYS DISCHARGE THIS AND MANY OTHER DUTIES INCUMBENT UPON THEM WHEN HE FAILS IN THESE MORAL AND LEGAL OBLIGATIONS WHEN AN INTELLIGENT ACTIVE INDUSTRIOUS FRUGAL WOMAN FINDS SHE HAS MARRIED A MAN WHO INSTEAD OF COMING UP TO THE STANDARD OF HUSBAND IS A MERE DEPENDENT WHO ACKNOWLEDGES THAT HE IS ONLY A HELPMATE TO HIS WIFE OBEYS HER INSTRUCTIONS POURS HIS LITTLE EARNINGS INTO HER LAP ACKNOWLEDGES HER TO BE AND TO HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY AND LEAVES TO HER ITS SUPPORT IT WOULD BE CONTRADICTORY OF FACT AND AN ABSURD CONSTRUCTION OF LAW TO SAY HE AND NOT SHE IS THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY AND DENY TO HER THE BENEFITS INTENDED FOR THE FAMILY OUT OF HER SEPARATE ESTATE PROPERTY SHEBHAS ACCUMULATED BECAUSE THE TITLE IS IN HER AND SHE LIVES WITH HER HUSBAND THIS WOULD SEEM TO DEFEAT INSTEAD OF CONSTRUING THE LAW TO THE END THAT ALL THE INTENTS THEREOF MAY BE FULLY AND PERFECTLY

TO THE INCOME RENTS AND PROFITS SHE COULD LEASE WITHOUT THE CONCURRENCE OF HER HUSBAND AND COULD PUT THE LESSEE IN POSSESSION OF THE PREMISES INCLUDING THE BUILDINGS HAVING THIS LARGE CONTROL OVER THE PROPERTY SHE WAS CERTAINLY WITHIN THE REASON OF THE STATUTE AND WE THINK WITHIN ITS WORDS THE DEBTOR MUST BOTH OWN AND RESIDE UPON THE LAND MUST BE A HOUSEHOLDER AND HAVE A FAMILY UNDER THAT POLICY WHICH SECURES TO THE WIFE ALL THE PROPERTY OWNED BY HER AT THE TIME OF THE MARRIAGE AND ALL SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS THERE MUST BE A MULTITUDE OF INSTANCES WHERE ALL THE MEANS FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE FAMILY ARE EXCLUSIVELY HERS AND THE ARGUMENT IS JUST AS STRONG TO PROTECT HER HOMESTEAD FROM SEIZURE AND SALE AS WHERE THE PROPERTY BELONGS TO THE HUSBAND AND HE IS THE DEBTOR BRIGHAM V BUSH  PERRY CITED IS PARALLEL TO THE CASE AT BAR THE NEW YORK STATUTE PROIVDES THAT CERTAIN PROPERTY WHEN OWNED BY A PERSON BEING A HOUSEHOLDER SHALL BE EXEMPT THE COURT HELD THAT MRS BRIGHAM ALTHOUGH MARRIED WAS

PROPERTY LEVIED UPON AS EXEMPT AND THAT HER PROPERTY BEING LESS THAN 300 IN VALUE THE WIFE AND HUSBAND HAD THE RIGHT TO CLAIM A JOINT HOMESTEAD 532 DECRICHARDSON V WOODWARD JUDGE RAY IN DELIVERING THE OPININION OF THE COURT USED THE FOLLOW ING LANGUAGE THE LANGUAGE OF THE LAW MUST THEREFORE BE CONSTRUED WITH REGARD TO THE DECLARED OBJECTS AND PURPOSES TO BE ACCOMPLISHED AND EFFECT GIVEN SO FAR AS REA SONABLY CAN BE TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL DECLARATION THE PLAIN INTENT IS TO PRESERVE A HOME OR SUPPORT FOR THE FAMILY AND NOT FOR ITS HEAD AS DISTINGUISHED FROM ITS MEMBERS WHERE THEREFORE THE HUSBAND AND WIFE ARE LIVING TOGETHER AND THE PROPERTY OF THE HUSBAND DOES NOT REACH THE LIMIT FIXED BY LAW AND THE WIFE IS THE OWNER OF THE PROPERTY LEVIED UPON AND YET CLAIMED AS EXEMPT AND IS HERSELF THE REAL DEBTOR IN THE JUDGMENT AND EXECUTION WE MUST REGARD HER CLAIM TO EXEMP TION AS VALID TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO MAKE WITH HER HUSBANDS PROPERTY THE AMOUNT PROTECTED BY THE STATUTES WHILE DENOMINATING THE HUSBAND AS THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY THIS JOINT HEAD OF THE FAMILY FOR THE PURPOSE OF HOMESTEAD EXEMPTIONS IS RECOGNIZED IN SOUTH CAROLINA IN THE CONSTITUTION STATUTES AND THE DECISIONS CONSTITUTION SOUTH CAROLINA ART 3 SEC 28 REV STAT 2132 IN RE MCCUTCHEN 4 N B R 81 100 FED REP 779 UNDER THE RULE OF CONSTRUCTION IN THE CONSTITUTION FOR THE REASONS GIVEN UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE THE CONCLUSION IS THERE IS ERROR THE WIFE LIVING WITH HER HUSBAND HAVING A SEPARATE ESTATE AND BEING THE DEBTOR MAY BE THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY OR THERE MAY BE A JOINT HEAD OF THE FAMILY FOR HOMESTEAD PURPOSES CERTAINLY THERE ARE DECISIONS WHICH MIGHT TEND TO A DIFFERENT CON CLUSION BUT THE WEIGHT OF AUTHORITY IS TO THE EFFECT THAT WHERE THE WIFE IS THE OWNER OF THE PROPERTY WHERE SHE TRADES AS A FEME SOLE AND IS THE DEBTOR AND THE HUSBAND CANNOT AND DOES NOT CLAIM THE HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION THE WIFE THOUGH LIVING WITH HER HUSBAND MAY BE ALONE OR JOINTLY WITH HIM THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY AND AS SUCH CLAIM THE HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE AT BAR THE PETITIONER A MARRIED WOMAN LIVING WITH HER HUSBAND IS ENTITLED TO THE HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION AND THERE WAS ERROR IN REFUSING TO ALLOW SUCH CLAIM THE DECREE OF THE DISTRICT COURT IS REVERSED AND THE CAUSE REMANDED THAT THE CLAIM FOR THE HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION BY THE BANKRUPT BE ALLOWED REVERSED NOTETHE RULING IN THIS CASE THAT UNDER THE VIRGINIA STATUTE OF EXEMPTIONS A MARRIED WOMAN LIVING WITH HER HUSBANDTHE HUSBAND BEING ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN BUSINESS AND DEVOTING ALL HIS EARNINGS TO THE SUPPORT OF HIS FAMILYMAY CLAIM THE BENEFIT OF THE STATUTORY EXEMPTION AS A HOUSEHOLDER AND HEAD OF A FAMILY ESTABLISHES A PRINCIPLE OF MUCH PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE IF THE DECISION IS TO BE FOL LOWED BY THE STATE COURTS IT IS SOMEWHAT REMARKABLE THAT THE QUESTION OF THE 1900 533534 6 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER DEC RIGHT OF A WIFE TO CLAIM THE BENEFIT OF THE EXEMPTION HAS NOT HERETOFORE ARISEN IN OUR COURT OF APPEALS THE AUTHORITIES UPON THE QUESTION OF THE WIFES RIGHT IN SUCH CASE ARE COLLECTED IN 15 AM  ENG ENC LAW 2D ED 546547 FROM WHICH IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN NUMBERS THEY ARE ABOUT EQUALLY DIVIDED AUTHORITIES ON THE SUBJECT HOWEVER ARE OF LITTLE ASSISTANCE OUTSIDE OF THEIR LOCAL JURISDICTION UNLESS STUDIED IN IMMEDIATE CONNECTION WITH THE STATUTE CONSTRUED WIDE DIVERSITY EXISTS IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE EXEMPTION LAWS OF THE SEVERAL STATES AND CASES CONSTRUING ONE OF THESE STATUTES ARE TO BE RECEIVED WITH CAUTION IN INTERPRETING THE STATUTE OF A DIFFERENT STATE A CAREFUL READING OF CHAPTER 178 OF THE VIRGINIA CODE INDICATES IN UNMISTAKE ABLE TERMS THAT IT WAS NOT DRAWN ON THE THEORY THAT THE EXEMPTION MIGHT BE CLAIMED BY A MARRIED WOMAN FOR EXAMPLE IN ORDER TO ALIENATE REAL ESTATE SET APART AS EXEMPT THE WIFE MUST UNITE SEC 3634BUT THERE IS NO CORRESPONDING PROVISION AS TO THE HUSBANDS UNITING IN THE WIFES EXEMPT REALTY AFTER THE DEATH OF THE HOUSEHOLDER THE EXEMPTION IS CONTINUED TO HIS WIDOW AND MINOR CHILDREN SEC 3635BUT NOT TO THE SURVIVING HUSBAND AND CHILDREN AND IF NOT SET APART BV THE HOUSEHOLDER IT MAY BE DONE BY HIS WIDOW AND CHILDREN SEC 3636 IF THE WIDOW RECEIVES DOWER SHE WAIVES THE EXEMPTION SEE 3637BUT THE EFFECT OF THE HUSBANDS ACCEPTANCE OF CURTESY IS UNPROVIDED FOR ESTATE SET APART AND HELD BY THE WIDOW AND CHILDREN MAY BE SOLD FOR REINVESTMENT BY A PRESCRIBED JUDICIAL PRO CEEDING SEC 3641BUT NO METHOD IS PROVIDED BY WHICH A SURVIVING HUSBAND SIMILARLY SITUATED MAY HAVE THE BENEFIT OF SUCH PROCEEDING IN CASE THE HOUSE HOLDER DIES WITHOUT WIFE OR CHILDREN SURVIVING OR UPON THE DEATH OR REMARRIAGE OF THE WIDOW AND THE ATTAINMENT OF THEIR MAJORITY BY THE CHILDREN OR THEIR MARRIAGE THE EXEMPTION CEASES SEC 3649BUT NO PROVISION IS MADE FOR THE CASE OF THE SUR VIVING HUSBANDS DEATH OR REMARRIAGE IN SHORT NOTHING COULD BE PLAINER THAN THAT THE DRAUGHTSMAN OF THIS CHAPTER DID NOT ONCE CONTEMPLATE THAT THE HOUSEHOLDER FOR WHOM THE EXEMPTION WAS PROVIDED COULD BE A MARRIED WOMAN WHETHER THE LIBERAL CONSTRUCTION ENJOINED BY THE CONSTITUTION WARRANTS READING INTO THE STATUTE WHAT THE LEGISLATURE DELIBERATELY OMITTED FROM IT IS NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR ONE MAY IMAGINE A CASE WHICH WOULD STRONGLY APPEAL TO THE SYMPATHIES OF THE COURT AND POSSIBLY JUSTIFY SOME DEPARTURE FROM THE LANGUAGE OF THE STATUTEA CASE FOR EXAMPLE WHERE THE HUSBAND IS AN INVALID INCAPABLE OF PROVIDING FOR HIS FAMILYOR HAS DESERTED HIS FAMILYTHE WIFE THEREBY BECOMING IN FACT ITS HEAD AND MAIN SUPPORT BUT IN THE PRINCIPAL CASE THE HUSBAND SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN ABLEBODIED INDUSTRIOUS AND ENERGETIC THE WIFE WAS NOMINALLY POSTMISTRESS AND OWNER OF THE STORE IN THE CONDUCT OF WHICH THE PLAINTIFFS DEBTS WERE INCURRED BUT THE HUSBAND HIMSELF CONDUCTED BOTH THE POSTOFFICE AND THE STORE AND ALSO RAN A HACK LINE NOT ONLY THIS BUT HE HAD ACTUALLY CLAIMED EXEMPTION UNDER THE POOR LAW CODE SEC 3650 AS A HOUSEHOLDER AND HEAD OF A FAMILY UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THERE WOULD SEEM TO BE SOME DIFFICULTY IN ALLOWING THE WIFES CLAIM UNLESS A FAMILY MAY HAVE TWO HEADS WHETHER THIS ANOMALOUS CONDITION CAN LEGALLY EXIST UNDER CHAPTER 178 CAN BE AUTHORITATIVELY SETTLED ONLY BY THE DECISION OF THE STATE COURT OF LAST RESORT THE STATEMENT BY THE COURT IN THE PRINCIPAL CASE THAT AN UNMARRIED MAN CAN NOT CLAIM THE EXEMPTION NOR ONE WHO IS NOT A HOUSEHOLDER AND THAT THE EXEMP TION CAN BE CLAIMED ONLY BY A HOUSEHOLDER  WHO IS THE HEAD OF A FAMILY RUNS COUN TER TO THE DOCTRINE OF CALHOUN V WILLIAMS 32 GRATT 18 AND WILKINSON V MERRILL1900 RICHARDSON V WOODWARD 535 87 VA 513 AND TO THE ACCEPTED DOCTRINE IN VIRGINIA THAT IN ORDER TO CLAIM THE BENEFIT OF THE EXEMPTION THE DEBTOR NEED NEITHER BE MARRIED NOR NEED HE OWN OR OCCUPY A HOUSE ALL THAT IS NECESSARY IS THAT THE DEBTOR SHALL BE THE HEAD OF A FAMILY SECTION 3657 OF THE CODE AS AMENDED BY ACTS OF 18878 P 423 DECLARING THAT THE TERM HOUSEHOLDER  SHALL BE EQUIVALENT TO  HOUSEHOLDER OR HEAD OF A FAMILY THE EXEMPTION LAW OF VIRGINIA DIFFERS FROM THAT OF MANY OF THE OTHER STATES IN PERMITTING THE DEBTOR TO CLAIM HIS EXEMPTION IN PERSONALTY AS WELL AS REALTY IT IS NOT THEREFORE PROPERLY A  HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION AS IN MANY OF THE STATES THE WORD HOMESTEAD DOES NOT OCCUR ONCE WE BELIEVE IN CHAPTER 178 OF THE CODE THIS DIFFERENCE SHOULD BE BORNE IN MIND IN APPLYING THE DECISIONS OF COURTS OF OTHER STATES TO THE VIRGINIA STATUTE IN THE PRINCIPAL CASE THE FACT THAT THE WIFE OWNED THE HOME SEEMS TO HAVE INFLUENCED THE COURT IN HOLDING HER TO BE A HOUSEHOLDER IT MAY BE CONCEDED THAT WHERE THE PURPOSE OF THE STATUTE IS TO SECURE A  HOMESTEAD THAT IS REAL ESTATE OCCUPIED AS A HOME FOR THE FAMILY AND THIS HOMESTEAD HAPPENS TO BELONG TO THE WIFE THERE IS STRONG GROUND FOR PER MITTING HER TO CLAIM IT BUT AS SHOWN THIS IS NOT THE THEORY ON WHICH THE VIR GINIA STATUTE IS DRAWN

REQUIREMENT IT WILL BE SEEN THEN THAT THIS UNIVERSITY IS CLEARLY IN THE VAN IN THE IMPORTANT MATTER OF DEFINING THE CONDITIONS UPON WHICH THE UNIVERSITY IS WILLING TO ENDORSE ITS GRADUATES WHO DESIRE TO ENTER THE TEACHING PROFESSION WE HOPE THIS PLAN WILL BE DISCUSSED BY OTHER UNIVERSITIES AND SOME DEFINITE ACTION TAKEN BY WHICH OUR HIGH SCHOOLS MAY BE PROTECTED FROM THE WELLMEANT BUT INDISCRIMINATE AND MIS LEADING RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH TOO MANY PROFESSORS GIVE TO GRADUATES WHO DESIRE TO TEACH IN OUR APRIL NUMBER WE COMMENTED ON THE RECENT REFORMS INTRODUCED INTO THE HIGHER SCHOOLS OF GERMANY BY THE EMPEROR AND CITED A LETTER TO SHOW HIS INSIGHT INTO THE PROBLEMS OF EDUCATION WHILE HE WAS YET A VERY YOUNG MAN IT IS INTERESTING TO FIND THAT ANOTHER EUROPEAN MONARCH THE CZAR OF ALL THE RUSSIAS HAS RECENTLY PUT HIMSELF ON RECORD IN FAVOR OF REFORM IN EDUCATION AND THE EXTENSION OF ITS PRIVILEGES THE TRAGIC DEATH OF M BOGILOFF AT THE HANDS OF A STUDENT MIGHT WELL HAVE LED US TO BELIEVE THAT STERN REPRES SIVE MEASURES WOULD BE TAKEN BY THE CZAR BUT IN HIS LETTER TO GENERAL VANOVSKI APPOINTING HIM TO SUCCEED BOGILOFF AS MINISTER OF PUBLIC INSTRUC TION HE SAYS THE REGULAR ORGANIZATION OF POPULAR EDUCATION HAS ALWAYS FORMED ONE OF THE CHIEF CARES OF RUSSIAN RULERS WHO HAVE STRIVEN SURELY BUT GRADUALLY TO PERFECT IT IN ACCORD ANCE WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF RUSSIAN LIFE AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF TIME EXPERIENCES OF RECENT YEARS HOWEVER HAVE SHOWN THE EXISTENCE OF DEFECTS SO MATERIAL IN OUR SCHOLASTIC SYSTEM THAT I THINK THE TIME HAS COME TO UNDERTAKE AN IMMEDIATE AND THOROUGH REVISION AND IMPROVEMENT HIGHLY VALUING YOUR EXPERIENCE AS A STATES MAN AND YOUR ENLIGHTENMENT I HAVE CHOSEN YOU TO COOPERATE WITH ME IN THE WORK OF RENOVATING AND REORGANIZING RUSSIAN SCHOOLS AND IN APPOINTING YOU TO THE SPECIALLY IMPORTANT OFFICE I AM FIRMLY CONVINCED THAT YOU WILL UNSWERVINGLY AIM TO ATTAIN THE GOAL INDICATED AND THAT YOU WILL BRING INTO THE WORK OF EDUCATING THE RUSSIAN YOUTH YOUR CORDIAL SYMPATHY AND SAGACITY RIPENED BY EXPERIENCE MAY GOD BLESS OUR WORK AND MAY PARENTS OF FAMILIESWHO ABOVE ALL ARE BOUND TO CARE FOR THEIR CHILDREN HELP US IN OUR WORK THEN THE TIME WILL SOON COME WHEN I WITH ALL MY PEOPLE SHALL SEE IN THE YOUNG GENERATION WITH PRIDE AND ENCOURAGEMENT FIRM AND SURE HOPE AND ITS STRONG PROTECTION FOR THE FUTURE DEAN BRIGGS IN HIS ADDRESS AT THE MEETING OF THE DEPARTMENT OF SUPERIN TENDENCE IN THIS CITY PREACHED THE GOSPEL FOR THIS AGE OF WORK KIPLING IN THAT SOMEWHAT GRUESOME POEM TOMLINSON TELLS US THAT THE QUESTION TO BE ASKED OF US HEREAFTER IS WHAT HA YE DONE   MR BRIGGS SEEMED TO ACCEPT THIS IN HIS CHARACTERIZATION OF SOME TENDENCIES IN THE EDUCATION OF TODAY HE SAID THE TENDENCY OF EDUCATION IN THIS COUNTRY IS TO TURN WORK INTO PLAY JUST AS THE TENDENCY OF OUTDOOR GAMES IN THIS COUNTRY IS TO TURN PLAY INTO WORK FOR EARLY EDUCA TION WE HAVE THE KINDERGARTEN FOR FOOTBALL WE HAVE RELENTLESS TRAINING HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT OF ONE REASON WHY IN AMERICAN COLLEGES ATHLETICS MEAN SO MUCH IT IS ATHLETICS IN WHICH MANY A YOUTH PAMPERED AT HOME AND IN SCHOOL GETS HIS EARLY TASTE OF THE STERN DISCIPLINE WITHOUT WHICH HE CANNOT BE A MAN HIS STUDIES HE EVADES AND HIS FRIENDS PARDON THE EVASION HIS FOOTBALL HE CANNOT EVADE OR HE IS BRANDED AS A 404EDITORIAL NOTES QUITTER AS SOFT OR SANDLESS FROM HIS STUDIES HE GETS MORE OR LESS CULTURE BUT NO BACKBONE FROM HIS FOOTBALL HE GETS THE STUFF AND SUBSTANCE OF HIS EDUCATION THE BUSINESS MAN OFTEN PREFERS IN HIS OFFICE A SUCCESSFUL COLLEGE ATHLETE TO A SUCCESSFUL COL LEGE SCHOLAR FOR THE ATHLETE AS THE BUSINESS MAN SAYS HAS DONE SOMETHING THERE ARE MANY WHO ARE UNABLE TO BELIEVE ALL THAT DEAN BRIGGS SAID BUT IT IS TOO COMMON A TRAIT AMONG UNTHINKING PERSONS OF TODAYAND THERE ARE SUCH IN THE TEACHING PROFESSIONTO CONDEMN UTTERLY AN ADDRESS WITH ALL OF WHOSE SENTIMENTS THEY ARE NOT FULLY IN ACCORD THEY APPLAUD THE EMOTIONAL PLATITUDES WHICH LEAD THEM NOWHERE BUT LEAVE THEM WITH A CERTAIN PLEASANT KIND OF SENSATION THEY RESENT CRITICISM AND FORGET THAT THE MISSION OF A GREAT SPEAKER IS NOT TO CONVERT BUT TO STIR UP THOUGHT THAT HIS MESSAGE IS NOT INSTRUCTIVE ALONE BUT IS PRIMARILY SUGGESTIVE THE MULTIPLICATION OF DEPARTMENTS AT THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION MEETINGS MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR ONE TO ATTEND MANY AND GET REAL BENEFIT FROM THEM THE INSPIRATIONAL AND EMOTIONAL GATHERINGS ARE GENERALLY THRONGED BECAUSE SO MANY TEACHERS GO TO ABSORB NOT TO CONTRIBUTE THE SMALLER AND MORE SPEC IALIZED DEPARTMENTS DO NOT ALWAYS RECEIVE THEIR JUST SHARE OF ATTENTION AND YET IN THESE ARE OFTEN DISCUSSED QUESTIONS THAT ARE VITAL TO THE HEALTH AND PROGRESS OF OUR SCHOOLS SUCH A DEPARTMENT IS THAT OF THE LIBRARIES TO WHICH SPECIAL CARE IS BEING GIVEN THIS YEAR THAT THE MEETING IN DETROIT MAY HELP TO SOLVE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT ARISE IN CONNECTION WITH THE EQUIPMENT AND USE OF A SCHOOL LIBRARY AND THE BEST PLAN FOR CO8PERATION WITH THE CITY LIBRARY IN A CHARACTERISTICALLY BUSINESS WAY THE LIBRARIANS ARE STIRRING UP THE PUBLIC PRESS AND THE OUTLOOK FOR A GOOD MEETING OF THIS IMPORTANT DEPARTMENT IS DECID EDLY ENCOURAGING ONE CAN EASILY SEE HOW OPPORTUNE SUCH A MOVEMENT IS COMING AS IT DOES AT A TIME WHEN SO MANY TOWNS ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF MR CARNEGIES GENEROSITY AND ARE PLEDGING THEMSELVES TO THE EXPENDITURE OF A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY EACH YEAR IT IS THE DUTY OF THE SUPERINTENDENT AND HIGHSCHOOL PRINCIPAL TO TAKE AN INTELLIGENT INTEREST IN THIS MOVEMENT SO THAT THE CHILDREN IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS WILL BE PROVIDED WITH SUITABLE LITERATURE WE MIGHT WELL EMPHASIZE THE WORD INTELLIGENT FOR TOO MANY OF OUR SCHOOL OFFICIALS ARE IGNORANT OF THE WORK OF THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND THEIR KNOWL EDGE OF BOOKS IS BOUNDED BY THE CLASSES OF SCHOOLBOOKS SUBMITTED TO THEM BY AGENTS OF PUBLISHING HOUSES WE STRONGLY URGE UPON OUR TEACHERS WHO ARE GOING TO THE N E A TO ATTEND THE SESSIONS OF THE LIBRARY DEPARTMENT AND TAKE PART IN THE DISCUSSIONS MR J C DANA OF SPRINGFIELD MASS OR MR MELVIL DEWEY OF ALBANY N Y WILL GLADLY ANSWER COMMUNICATIONS ON THIS SUBJECT IN OUR SEPTEMBER NUMBER WE PUBLISHED THE ELECTIVE COURSE OF STUDY ADOPTED IN THE HIGH SCHOOL OF MEDFORD MASS AS THIS AWAKENED MUCH INTEREST WE NOW ADD THE COMMENTS OF MR C H MORSS THE SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS OF THAT CITY IN HIS REPORT FOR THE PAST YEAR SINCE THE COURSE OF STUDY HAS BEEN MADE ELECTIVE BY SUBJECTS RATHER THAN BY COURSES PARENTS HAVE SEEMED TO TAKE A MORE ACTIVE INTEREST IN THE WORK OF THEIR CHILDREN 405406 THE SCHOOL REVIEW AS A WHOLE THEY HAVE HEARTILY RESPONDED TO OUR EFFORTS TO SHAPE AND ADAPT THE WORK MORE DIRECTLY TO THE NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUAL CHILD AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR WISHES MANY WORDS OF APPROVAL OF THIS COURSE HAVE COME TO US FROM THEM AND THEIR SELECTION OF STUDIES HAS IN ONLY A FEW CASES CALLED FOR UNFAVORABLE COMMENT THE DIFFER ENT SUBJECTS STUDIED IN THE SCHOOL ARE PURSUED BY THE NUMBER OF PUPILS SHOWN IN

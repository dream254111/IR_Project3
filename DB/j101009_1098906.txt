ADVEtSE POSSEsSIONIn Gorman v Goriman 57 N Y Supp 1069 it is held that a pur chaser of real estate at a judicial sale will not be compelled to take the propertywhere it develops that the title depends solely on the effect of adverse possession under the statute of limitations and the fact of such adverse holding rests only in parol testimony In the case of a judicial sale says the court where ques tions may be reasonably raised affecting the title the courts are more ready to relieve a purchaser than where the contract arises out of a private transaction between the parties but even in the latter case if resort must be had to parol evidence if it depends upon questions of fact then a purchaser should and will not be compelled to perform his contract Holly v Hirsch 135 N Y 590 32 N E 709 Heller v Cohen 154 N Y 299 48 N E 527 Moot v Association 157 N Y 201 52 N E 1 The general subject of specific performance of contracts for the sale of real estate where the title rests only on adverse possession is discussed with a full review of the authorities in 33 Am Law Review 357 LEGACTESDEMONSTRATIVE AND SPECIFICTestatrix devised to her daughter all of her real estate and all money belonging to her on deposit in the daughters name with directions that the latter should out of the moneys belonging to me on deposit in her name pay to my son the sum of fifteen hundred dollars At the date of the will the testatrix had on deposit in her daughters name 1800 but at the time of her death considerably less than 1500 On a bill filed by the son to require the daughter who was also executrix to pay the full amount of 1500 to the son Held That the legacy to the son was specific and not demonstrative and hence was adeemed pro tanto by withdrawal of the fund from bank by the testatrix in her lifetime Crawford v McCarthy N Y 54 N E 277 The court holds that a mere gift of or out of a particular fund is not demon strative but specific To constitute the legacy a demonstrative one two elements are essential 1 A bequest in the nature of a general legacy and 2 It must point to a fund out of which the payment is to be made In this case the first of these elements was lacking The gift was not of 1500 to be paid out of the fund in bank but of 1500 out of the deposit If the gift had been all moneys on deposit or half of the funds on deposit this would clearly have been specific So a specified amount of the funds on deposit is likewise specific The case is a close one but the decision appears to be sound NEGOTIABLE PAPERPREMATURE ACTIONIn Humphreys v Sutcliffe 43 Atl 954 the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania discusses the unsettled question whether an action may be brought against the maker of a promissory note on the day of its maturity after presentment demand and protest The court concludes that the weight of authority is in favor of the maintenance of the action Citing 2 Parsons Bills  N 461 Greeley v Thurston 4 Greenl 479 On this subject it is said in 2 Daniel Neg Instr 1208 In case of ordinary contracts to be performed upon a certain day they are really solvable within that day and as the promisor has the whole of that day for their performance suit cannot be commenced until that day has passed But where the maker of a note or the drawer or acceptor of a bill makes it payable on a day certain his contract is to pay it on demand on any part of that day if made within reasonable hours The protest must be made on that day which presupposes a default already made 1899 329 NOTES OF CASES

death of the patient any physician or dentist who administered it in such a case with a fatal result ONE OF THE DIFFICULT problems which pre sents itself for solution in the south is how to reduce the mortality among the blacks That it has not yet been solved is made evident by a study of the vital statistics of southern cities These records show that the deathrate of the negroes is double that of the whites Savannah Ga how ever seems to be exceptionally unhealthy in this regard It is stated that in that city while the rate for the white population is but 1219 per thousand a remarkably low rate and probably not correct that for the blacks is 122 If these figures are correct there is opportunity for much missionary work of a sanitary nature in the city of Savannah ECONOIMIC LAWS AND METHODS IF it should be said that the material out of which the science of mechanics was built was wood and stone iron and steel every one would see the mistake But when Mr H C Adams in his interesting paper on economics and jurispru dence speaks of the material surroundings of men and the legal structure of society as material out of which the science of economics is built he falls into precisely the same error Science July 2 It would be unfair to Mr Adams personally to lay too much stress on a random expression torn from its context but it is not unfair to the school of thought to which he belongs We have singled this expression out for criticism because it is char acteristic of the school It represents a view of the whole subject which is likely to lead to grave mistakes in thinking and in action That Mr Adams himself will make those mistakes we do not believe We should be sorry to say a word which should even seem to detract from the value of his work He is one of the few men who com bine originality with critical judgment But the high character of the writer makes it all the more necessary to protest against his mistakes even though they be but incidental What he does inadvertently others will be led to do deliber ately The error lies in confounding the material to which a science is applied with the material out of which it is built or  to put the same thing in another formin identifying the material of a VCE VL VIII No 180 science with the materials of an art In itself this may seem a trivial matter  in its consequences it is extremely serious The material out of which the science of me chanics is built is not wood or iron in any sense whatever The science is built out of a few sim ple laws of motion nowhere exactly realized in nature and yet now admitted by every sensible man to be true And in like manner the material out of which the science of economics is built consists of a few simple laws of human nature the chief of which is that men strive to obtain the maximum of satisfaction with the minimum of sacrifice It does not insist that the sacrifice shall be solely physical or the satisfaction purely material It makes no more unwarranted assump tions than does pure mechanics The economic man has as much and as little real existence as the  material point As the fundamental assump tions of mechanics are involved in the definition of motion and the fact of its measurement so the fundamental assumptions of political economy are involved in the definition of motives and the fact of their measurement This measurement is far less accurate in moral science than in physical science the danger of dogmatism is therefore greater and the need for verification more con stant But to say that the verification is the sci ence is as much a mistake in the one case as in the other It is a mistake which is often made and which does great harm both in science and in practice It defeats the usefulness of verification as a means of discovery An illustration will help to make this clear The discovery of Neptune was due to a study of the motions of Uranus It was found that these motions were not exactly such as the laws of mechanics applied to the position of the known planets would explain It was therefore assumed that there must be certain unknown con ditions which entered into the case  and careful reasoning led to the discovery of a new planet whose position and size fulfilled those conditions Now let it be observed that by the method which the historical school so highly commends the inference from the motions of Uranus would simply have been that the law of gravitation was not as rigid as is commonly supposed Such an inference would not merely have been wrong in itself but it would have prevented the discovery of Neptune It is only when you assume a rigid law that your verification leads to new discoveries and it leads to the most fruitful discoveries where the law at first seems to fail That these new discoveries may sometimes take such a form that the old state ment of the law will need to be partly or whollyJULY 16 1886 SCIEl rejected does not alter the case The man who tries to reason without rigid hypotheses cripples his power of investigation Any one who under stands the real power and importance of verifica tion is justly indignant at any such conception of science as will prevent the use of verification as a means of discovery The failures of the attempt to work without rigid hypotheses from Lord Bacon down have been so conspicuous that they hardly need repetition Where the German school of economists has made any advance in the field of political economy itself it has been done by an abandonment of the socalled historical method and by a rigid application of deductive reasoning combined with careful verification It is Cohn and not Roscher who represents the really fruit ful line of German thought and whatever Cohn may at times have professed he relies strongly both on abstract reasoning and on the rigidity of law There is one class of cases where these distinc tions fall away and where the Baconian method is a good one When a science is so crude as to be mainly occupied with description and classifi cation there is little chance for the use of rigid hypotheses Here the distinction between the material and the science falls away Physics re mained in this condition till the seventeenth cen tury chemistry till the eiglhteenth it was not till the nineteenth that natural history began to give place to biology Sociology as a whole can hardly be said to have advanced beyond this stage but certain depart ments of sociology are distinctly beyond it nota bly law and political economy They have reached the point where it is possible to frame hypotheses and to carry out deductions and verifications The field of each science is limited but within its proper sphere each is a true science It is right enough to say that each is a part of something greater In the future we may hope that a scien tific sociology will be developed which shall in clude many other sciences But we have a science of political economy and we have not as yet a science of sociology in any thing like the same sense To reject the part which we have for the sake of the whole which we have not would be the extreme of folly It would be the same thing as to have rejected the undulatory theory of light fifty years ago because the correlation of forces was not yet discovered The theory of light was but a part of the truth but it was only on the basis of such parts that the whole could be built up A scientific part is a better startingpoint than an unscientific whole There is another class of dangers to which we are exposed when we deny all independence to yCE 47 economic reasoning The man or state that re fuses to recognize the rigidity of economic laws is likely to suffer for it sooner or later in his practi cal experience It is impossible for a man not to let his habits of thought affect his habits of action If he is ac customed to make rigid assumptions he tries to make things conform to these assumptions and to insist that something is wrong where they do not If on the other hand he reasons loosely he comes to act recklessly and to believe that his own luck or skill will save him from the necessity of careful calculation The error of reckless over confidence is at once more destructive and more common than the error of fatalism and any thing which encourages the former is usually more dan gerous than that which encourages the latter If a nearly spent cannonball is slowly rolling toward you the natural and sensible thing to do is to get out of the way The fatalist may refuse to do so because of his blind belief in fate The fool may refuse to do so because he thinks it is not coming fast enough to hurt him Now either extreme is bad but the practical danger is from the latter The experience of army surgeons will show that in the instance given there are probably ten fools to one fatalist And in like manner the danger of believing that economic laws can be interfered with by human effort is ten times greater than the danger of an extreme belief in laissezfaire Human nature is far more inclined to the former error Where the economists make a mistake in opposing state inter ference as when they tried to stop English factory legislation people will generally take their own course in spite of them Where they make the mistake of not opposing it people will be only too ready to seize upon their arguments And the same thing holds true of individual action as well as of state action The danger of believing that the results of past experience are uncertain is far greater than the danger of believing that we are helpless to improve upon them As a matter of fact there are limits within which the results of past experience are surpris ingly rigid That the worse currency drives out the better that food prices depend upon the mar gin of cultivation rather than upon rent that reckless marriage means starvation wages are laws which nations have been for centuries at tempting to disregard and of which they are hardly yet learning the full force They mark limits and effective limits upon legislative activity As long as political economy is occupied with defining those limits it can maintain its claim to the position of an authoritative science It says to the legislator  Thus far shalt thou go and no48 SCIE farther It does not say  Such and such legisla tion will produce the best results but it says  Beyond certain limits all legislation fails This is the natural relation of a science to an art Mechanics does not tell the bridgebuilder exactly how he must build his bridge considerations of beauty and convenience must be taken into account but mechanics warns the builder that if he disregards certain conditions of stability his bridge will fall Nobody insists that the axioms of mechanics should be modified because a bridge with the maximum of stability would be inconvenient or unsafe Nor do we insist that mechanics should solve all the problems of bridge building We let mechanical considerations limit the practical application of aesthetics and we let aesthetic considerations limit the practical applica tion of mechanical principles We do not attempt to fuse the two things together and then distrust both of them This may fairly illustrate the relation of eco nomics and jurisprudence Whether we shall ever be able to combine them into one science may be uncertain but we have not been able to do so as yet Each limits the practical application of the other Industrial activity is limited by legal con ditions legislative activity by economic condi tions The attempt to confuse the two and to merge them in a crude science of sociology seems for the present likely to check scientific progress and to involve us in serious practical dangers Each as a science is independent authoritative and rigid each forms the basis of an art which is subject to a thousand limitations ARTHUR T HADLEY CONVOCATION OF THE UNIVERSITY OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK THE twentyfourth convocation of the Univer sity of the state of New York began its sessions in the senate chamber of the capitol at Albany on Tuesday morning July 6 There was assembled a large number of college professors normal and high school teachers and friends of education from New York and other states The address of Hon Henry R Pierson chancel lor of the university was a very able and eloquent defence of the work of the university and its board of regents having special reference to the proposal recently made to abolish them both The chancellor examined in some detail the history and organization of Oxford Cambridge and Lon don universities He showed that these univer sities stand in precisely the same relation to the federated colleges under their control that the Uni versity of the state of New York bears to the TCE VOL VIII No 180 high schools academies and colleges of the state The history of the university amply justifies its existence Starting in 1784 with only one weak college Kings college now Columbia  under its control it embraced in 1885 45 colleges having 784 instructors and 11702 students and 1571 graduates during the year The total value of this college property is 2316461282 and their yearly expenditure amounts to 178739151 Be sides this there were in 1885 283 academies under the control of the regents of the university and 72426 answerpapers were examined and passed upon under the supervision of the regents during the year The chancellor stated that postgradu ate courses with corresponding examinations and degrees were now under consideration He con cluded Read the record of these convocations and I venture to say that no similar records of educational value can be found Shall we con sider these convocations a failure and nothing worth  It is true the university does not confer many degrees because that is a power concurrent with the colleges and it has been thought best to leave that duty mainly with them I think I have proved that in its past and present the duties of the university have been defined by law and that it has performed all the duties devolving upon it that the corporate name is not a misnomer and should not mislead and that the regents are doing too noble a work to be abolished or merged with any other body of educational workers The main interest of the first morning session centred in the discussion of the subject of manual trainingwhich was introduced in a paper by Prin cipal Love of Jamestown Mr Love claimed that the test of the practicability of manual training must be its usefulness Any system of training that does not start out with the idea that the scholar must become a producer is defective Principal Love detailed the workings of a system of manual training introduced by him in James town asserting that it did not detract from but rather added to the quantity and quality of intel lectual work performed by the pupils His account showed a gratifying success with an experiment which must sooner or later become general The afternoon session was given up to a discus sion of the question Has the college a logical place in the American system of education The subject was introduced by papers by Prof Oren Root of Hamilton college and Prof S G Williams of Cornell Both essayists as well as ViceChan cellor MacCracken of the University of the city of New York who opened the discussion of the pa pers combated the view expressed in some quar ters  notably by Professor West of Princeton in a paper read before the National teachers associa 17

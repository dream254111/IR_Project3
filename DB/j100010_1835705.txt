who have taken personally an active part in a campaign and not inferior professionally are the official reports of military attaches whose duty it has been to follow in the field the fortunes of the con tending armies The linguistic limits of this review confine our notice of this type of authorities to two groups the narratives and observations of American and British officers The former were published to the world by the General Staff of the United States Army in i906i907 The British War Office placed the reports of British officers at the disposal of the general public two years later Both these sets of reports cover much the same ground repre sentatives from the American and British armies having joined the contending forces almost simultaneously Collectively they present a mine of accurate information to the historian and professional student The criticisms recorded cannot of course be accepted as final having necessarily been written on somewhat imperfect infor mation yet however much the horizon may have been obscured by the smoke of battle observations jotted down while the pungent odor of gunpowder is still in the nostrils are primary evidence not to be lightly set on one side It would be as invidious as it is unnecessary to weigh these official reports one against another but it is not too much to say that to the British officers at any rate both sets have proved a great help in their professional studies The steady progress made dur ing the last five years in the training of British troops owes very much both to the compilers of these volumes and to the Japanese and Russian authorities who gave generous facilities for their com pilation With the volumes issued by the British War Office it is not proposed to deal in detail but it may be permitted to express the 1 Reports of Military Observers attached to the Armies in Manchuria during the RussoJapanese War parts I II III IV V Washington Government Print ing Office I906 I907 Reports from

professional libraries Of the reports rendered by the United States observers those of two officers in particular Captain Karl Reichmann I7th Infantry and Major Joseph E Kuhn Corps of Engineers strike the English reader as being of very special value Captain Reichmanns observations on the operations of the Russian army with which he served for some eight months from April to December I904 enhance the reputation he won as a shrewd and just military critic during the South African War Major Kuhn gives us the best professional reports on the siege of Port Arthur yet published in the English language moreover his clear narra tive is garnished with an abundance of valuable technical details and with many sound strategical and tactical comments Strategic ally Major Kuhn holds that although Port Arthur had ultimately to surrender as will be the case with any fortress it yet paid for itself many times over by neutralizing for five months an entire Japanese army and the entire Japanese fleet The time thus gained proved invaluable to the Russians    Had the defense of the fortress been conducted a little more energetically the first results might have been materially different In substance it will be noticed these views agree with those of Sir William Nicholson already quoted on pp 520 52I above Major Charles Lynchs account of the medical and sanitary arrangements of the Japanese army part IV of the United States Observers Reports may also be commended for careful study by all staff as well as medical officers The literature of this war has produced three really fascinating books each of a distinctive character as regards authorship matter and subjective treatment Two of these books Rasplata and Human Bullets we have already discussed The third is without doubt the ScrapBook which General Sir Ian Hamilton the second senior of the British military attaches was permitted to publish in addition to his official report2 Sir Ian joined Kurokis army at Fenghuangcheng in May I904 accompanied its fortunes as it forced its way through the mountain passes was present at the severe fights of Chiaotou Motienling Yushuling and Yangtzu ling watched closely the eleven days battle of Liaoyang and re mained with Kurokis quarters until after the fierce struggle of the Shaho when General Hamilton was recalled home to take up an important command in the south of England In the preface to his first volume Sir Ian modestly calls his book  impressions snap shots byproducts  and points out that it is impossible to evolve 2 LieutenantGeneral Sir Ian Hamilton A Staff Officers ScrapBook during the RussoJapanese War two volumes London 1905 I907738 A British Officer out of facts  fresh from the mint of battle an account which is either well balanced or exhaustive His snapshots need no apologia A frank daily personal diary written while attached to the headquarters of an army engaged in highly important operations by an officer of General Hamiltons high rank and great experience could not fail to be vastly interesting to soldiers but when the writer combines with his war experience and professional knowl edge keen powers of observation a sense of humor a shrewd judg ment of character and an easy attractive pen a true picture is pre sented of modern war and of a modern national army which both is in itself in a real sense historical and yet presents invaluable mater ial for the making of history Perhaps the most fascinating and the most valuable feature of these volumes is the close personal view they give of the Japanese generals and staff loyal to superiors and colleagues confident in their troops quiet and selfreliant at the most critical moments re served and taciturn while victory is in doubt frank when victory has been attained doing their work ever with a selfless devotion to their emperor and nation which seems incapable of contamina tion with even a grain of personal ambition or personal jealousy The Japanese officer as depicted by Sir Ian Hamilton presents indeed a noble figure and yet it is evident that when the painter commenced his work he was not wholly free from that bias in favor of his own race which characterizes those who have served long in the East and was quite prepared to criticize freely It was only after months of close contact with the Mikados soldiers after watching them tried and tested in the fiery furnace of war that the British general saw clearly the warrior spirit of Japan as it emerged triumphant from the bloody tumult  But the ScrapBook has attained such a wide circulation and popularity that it is superfluous to dwell on its merits the recent appearance of editions in German French and Russian is sufficient evidence of its value Sir Ian Hamiltons work terminates our list of purely evidential literature published in the English language Before passing on to the small but growing group of historical works it may be as well to refer briefly to the professional treatises partially historical but in the main critical which have been written by soldiers to enable soldiers to absorb readily the lessons of this great campaign A few examples of these must suffice Perhaps the most notable is the translation of the series of articles pub lished by General de Negrier late inspectorgeneral of the French army in the Revue des Deux Mondes The views of so distin General F 0 de N6grier Lessons of the RuissoJapanese War London i906 translated by E Louis SpiersLiterature of the RussoJapanese War 739 guished an officer must of necessity carry great weight It is there fore of special interest to find that in the matter of cavalry tactics de Negrier while laying stress on the paramount need for encoux aging the offensive spirit of that arm and for concentrating it for use on the actual battlefield joins direct issue with the Continental school which still pins its trust mainly on the arme blanche Fighting ion foot he tells us    has now become essential The urgent question at the present moment is therefore how to convert our cavalry from their inveterate faith in traditional evolutions and the obsolete shocktactics of the last century    Our methods of war fare must be changed In fighting on foot whenever necessary our cavalry must determine once for all to make as clean a sweep of the enemy as it did in the most brilliant days of the old kneetoknee charge With the hope of carrying out this change of ideas and of adapt ing cavalry to the requirements of modern war General de Negrier would remove all the minor distinctions of dragoons lancers hus sars etc and amalgamate the whole arm into one force adding to its equipment a bayonet to be attached to the sword scabbard and attaching two machine guns to each squadron and two bat teries of pompoms and a battery of large calibre howitzers to the cavalry division These recommendations will it is to be antici pated be long opposed by the intense conservatism with which European cavalry is impregnated a conservatism which as has been its wont in the past rejects the lessons of each successive modern campaign as  abnormal and still turns for its inspiration to the battlefields of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries But that the conception of the true power of cavalry put forward by de Negrier is sound it is difficult to controvert in view of the hard facts of the FrancoGerman War of the South African War and of the Man churian battlefields As regards the general tactics of the three arms it is important to note that the late inspectorgeneral of the French army emphatically rejects that cult of positions which proved fatal to France in I870 The RussoJapanese War  he declares has demonstrated yet once again that by offensive tactics alone can victory be assured In his Lectures on the Strategy of the RussoJapanese War4 Major Bird late professor of the Indian Staff College presents to the military student a valuable summary of the strategical move ments and much thoughtful criticism His condemnation how ever of converging strategy as most risky  and as affording the opponent an opportunity of beating the advancing columns in detail BrevetMajor W D Bird Lectures on the Strategy of the RussoJapanese War London I909 AM HIST REV VOL XVI 48740 A British Officer is much open to dispute The question is too large and too tech nical for discussion here but it may be permitted to point out that three great modern campaigns i866 i870 and I904 tend to con trovert such teaching and that although in the Napoleonic wars when tactical conditions were other than those now prevailing great converging movements ended at times disastrously yet Na poleon himself employed notably in I805 this very form of strat egy with astounding success An interesting example of that deeprooted conservatism to which reference has been already made is to be found in Count Gustav Wrangels memoir on The Cavalry in the RussoJapanese War5 Count Wrangel adheres to the timeworn theory that cav alry which seeks salvation with the rifle loses its offensive spirit an argument which if pushed to its logical consequence leads to the amazing conclusion that it is impossible for infantry to assume the offensive Yet later he weakens as to this dogma by admitting that in future wars the use of cavalry dismounted will be so to say our daily bread  and even preaches that good cavalry must learn in peace time to feel at home in the firing line  Count Wrangel lays stress very justly on the importance of the reconnaissance duties of cavalry yet he somewhat fails to grasp the grave diffi culties with which they are circumscribed under the conditions of modern war and the vital need for an efficient intelligence depart ment An anonymous German writer  Asiaticus  in his Recon naissance in the RussoJapanese WVar avoids this error6 His his torical examples are culled with judgment The criticisms thereon are those of a student who seeks not to bolster up preconceived theories but to wrest from the facts of a campaign the principles and methods by which success can be attained under modern con ditions His dediuctions therefore are marked with commendable moderation and hold an even balance between the extreme rifle and arme blaniche schools of thought As regards reconnaissance  Asiaticus  devotes a chapter to espionage and points out that the Japanese experiment of combining infantry with cavalry for recon noitring and screening duties produced good results We have discussed earlier in this review the narratives of press correspondents in the field Important organs of public opinion are not however content with merely laying before their readers the Count Gustav Wrangel Austrian cavalry The Cavalry

and the news emanating from other sources by such criticisms and summing up of the situation as will enable read ers to follow the course of the campaign intelligently The duty of writing from time to time these appreciations and making forecasts on necessarily imperfect information is a difficult task It demands sound knowledge of military service a trained judgment assiduous study and a natural gift for piercing the fog of war Of all the writers who attempted this task during the RussoJapanese cam paign the military correspondent of the Times was preeminently the most successful a success in which both the Staff College and the Military Intelligence Department may take pride seeing that Colonel Repington is a distinguished alumnus of both those establishments His articles though written under the trying conditions and limita tions of work for a daily paper are too valuable to be lost to perma nent literature and the author was therefore well advised to revise and collate them under the title of The War in the Far East7 He offers this work as a preliminary study of the campaign and maintains that an account written as this was from day to day and thus preserving contemporary color warmth and even partisanship might serve as a useful reminder that those who direct armies and fleets have to deal with a number of factors of which history some times takes insufficient account and that in relation to the intentions and proceedings of the enemy these leaders have largely to rely upon intuition and judgment and have rarely before them all those nicely tabulated facts and certainties which are at the disposal of the ultimate historian when the latter distributes praise and blame The claim is made good Colonel Repington presents in this book an admirable study of the war as a series of contemporary events Some of his chapters are purely historical but others and these perhaps the most valuable are just such critical appreciations of strategic situations as a chief of the staff would lay before his general The maps bound up with the book are worthy of the letterpress The views expressed in the chapter entitled The En tanglement of Port Arthur as to the uselessness of fortified naval bases are not it is true those usually accepted by strategists but in every other respect this work has much added to its authors high reputation as a writer and military thinker It is a natural law that the history of great events demands a long period of gestation Works claiming the name of histories were it is true published before even the smoke of the RussoJap anese campaign had cleared from the horizon but the text of such 7The War in the Far East by the Military Correspondent of the Times London I905742 A British Officer books is built up obviously from snippings of newspapers and is valueless historically although their illustrations are often amus ing and occasionally of some interest8 But for the generating of full and accurate historical records of the gigantic struggle between the Czars and the Mikados armies the five years which have elapsed since the last shot was fired are all too short Neverthe less some progress has been made and the work goes forward hope fully The first and earliest history which may be studied with advantage is a useful examination of the diplomatic struggle which led up to the outbreak of hostilities written by Dr K Asakawa and entitled The RussoJapanese Conflict9 The strategy of a cam paign is often entirely based on its political causes and is invariably influenced if not dominated by the political goals towards which the efforts of the respective adversaries are directed Thus it is essential for the military as well as the general reader to master the national and political aspirations which have led to an appeal to arms before entering on a study of the actual operations of wvar Dr Asakawas volume although in part written originally in the form of articles for the Yale Review at the commencement of the war throws valuable light on these points He quotes copiously from the more important of the diplomatic despatches and discusses their bearing in an impartial spirit His book therefore forms a fair and intelligent introduction to the campaign and should not be neglected Of the campaign proper only two histories have as yet appeared in the English language that written partly by the General Staff of the British Army and partly by the Historical Section of the Com mittee of Imperial Defence and that put forth by the Historical Section of the German General Staff and subsequently translated by Lieutenant Karl von Donat Both these works still await completion the battles of Liaoyang and the Shaho being the final points as yet reached The British Official

part of the British authorities to promote the study of war by the production of an authorized narrative of a campaign The preparation of the firstthe History of the South African Warwas it will be recollected entrusted to MNajor General Sir Frederick Maurice At the last reorganization of the War Office the formation of an Historical Section of the General Staff was mooted and probably with that idea in view the General Staff itself took in hand the compilation of the first volume of a provisional military history of the RussoJapanese War Subse quently however the government decided to assign the duty of com piling official histories for both naval and military services to an Historical Section of the Committee of Imperial Defence This section at present consists of an officer of the Royal Marines two General Staff officers and a third military officer Since its organization some three years ago it has not only continued the provisional military history of the RussoJapanese War by bring ing out in succession parts II III IV and V of that work but has also put forth the first volume of a combined Naval and Military History Of these two works the latter although chronologically as yet the less advanced towards completion includes and super sedes the former The provisional military history written as it was to meet pressing educational requirements is much to be com mended for its clearness of narrative and the excellence of its maps A preface to one of its volumes tells us that in accordance with the wishes of the General Staff all comments except upon a few tac tical details are withheld until the production of the combined history  Presumably therefore although the actual preface of the first volume of the combined history runs in the name not of the His torical Section but of the Committee of Imperial Defence itself the military criticisms which the volume contains have been penned or at least approved by the great General Staff at the War Office while the naval criticisms we may conjecture are not so much the work of Mr Asquith and his political colleagues on the Defence Committee as of the Senior Naval Lord the Naval Intelligence Department and perhaps the Naval War College Staff If this be so it is perhaps to be regretted that a positive statement to that effect is not appended to the work The Committee of Imperial Defence is an excellent organization for the deliberate personal consultation of the responsible ministers of the Crown with their expert naval and military advisers on questions of naval or military policy but it is obvious that the opinion of a committee so composed on professional questions of744 A British Officer a purely naval or military character cannot have the same author itative weight as the direct utterances of the Admiralty and of the General Staff Yet this suggestion must not be taken as a criticism of a really admirable work the excellence of which is a matter for great thankfulness and congratulation in both services The compilers have be it noted enjoyed very unusual advantages The preface of the combined history tells us that its proofs were very care fully revised at Tokio both in the Admiralty and War Office  and that  much useful information has been also supplied by the Histor ical Section of the War Office at St Petersburg As a result of this generous assistance the accuracy of the work is above criticism Moreover it gives to the world hitherto unpublished documents of great historic value notably certain correspondence which took place between Kuropatkin and Stoessel at the commencement of the war and a very important telegram despatched from Tokio arresting the advance northward of Oyamas armies at the critical period when a sortie of the Russian fleet from Port Arthur was still possible Even therefore in its military narrative the combined history somewhat supplements the provisional military history while re producing its maps and retaining the admirable lucidity of its text The naval narrative and the naval and military comments are wholly new matter and their value can be best assessed by stating that they entirely maintain the high standard of the old The dominant note of the comments both naval and military is the inculcation of that offensive spirit which traditional for two centuries in the navy has of late years been unreservedly accepted by the auithorities of the British army To discuss these comments in detail here is not possible It must suffice to say that if the two subsequent volumes equal the first in merit this work will be of very great permanent value and will fill worthily its honorable posi tion of the first combined history of a great modern campaign in which the land and sea services were mutually and vitally dependent on each other The German official history1 deals in the main only with the military aspects of the war and thus lacks the completeness which characterizes the English National preparation in peace for

RussoJapanese War 745 and both in peace and war a wholehearted cultivation of the spirit of offence have long formed the basis of the German naval and mili tary systems The German General Staffs masterly comments are written throughout with this in mind They make it clear that the initial weakness of Russia was due to lack of adequate preparation and they emphasize moreover a point which is not fully realized in the United States or Great Britain that national armies are ser iously handicapped in morale when committed to a war which is unpopular with the nation Yet these were not the sole causes of Russias misfortunes The German critics are right in holding that on the Yalu the attack of the Russians suffered from a certain want of decision  and that during the whole war the Russians conduct of operations was doomed never to find a right way out of the partially selfimposed defensive attitude  These criticisms are applied in a particularly striking manner to Stackelbergs attempt to relieve Port Arthur The majority of military writers have branded that enterprise as doomed from the outset to failure and as an illustration of the fatal influence of the St Petersburg armchair strategists over the operations of the Russian armies in the field Not so the German Staff they hold that if the Russian troops had been more thoroughly trained and if Stackel berg had been reinforced by another division which was certainly possible it was not at all unlikely that the enterprise would prove suc cessful Though it would have been only a local success as regards the general siituation yet even such a success would have been of inestimable moral value after all the reverses the Russian armies had sustained    The pernicious halfhearted decision of the Commander inchief impressed its stamp upon Stackelberg and upon his subordinate leaders Liaoyang is regarded as the true decisive battle of the war For the German General Staff point out that the knowledge that Kuropatkin in spite of the numerical superiority of his troops failed to turn the fortune of battle in his favour on a field he himself had selected    deprived from the outset the great  offensive afterwards of all its vigour and during the last phase of the campaign    gave rise to no other thought than mere defensive It was not at Mukden and Tsushima that the Russians lost the campaign they lost it already at Liaoyang The narrative portion of these three volumes is in no way in ferior to the comments and the admirable maps are worthy of the text But the English reader has just grounds for complaint on one point In order to avoid redrawing the maps foreign spelling of the names of places is adhered to throughout in both maps and text Chinese names are difficult to remember and grapple with746 A British Officer under the most favorable conditions but when reproduced in a form of spelling entirely different to that with which one has become familiar after brainracking labor their effect is to put matters mildly peculiarly disheartening Pending the completion of these two General Staff histories the English translation of the narratives of the battles of the Shaho and of Mukden published in the MVIilitiir Wochenblatt will be found helpful especially as the value of these two narratives is greatly enhanced by the addition to them of clear comments by Lieutenant General von Caemmerer12 The most striking of that wellknown military writers observations is a criticism of the Japanese Great General Staffs plans at Mukden as lacking in boldness It was not enough in the eyes of General von Caemmerer that Marshal Oyama with only equal numbers and greatly inferior artillery committed his armies to a double enveloping attack on an enemy holding a position more strongly entrenched than Wellingtons lines at Torres Vedras It was not enough that he launched his whole force into that attack save only one and a half divisions kept at the outset under his own hand as a little rallying point in the case of misfor tune In von Caemmerers judgment nothing not one man should have been withheld from the great stake He would have assigned the General Reserve diminutive though it was at once  to the army where the decision was sought for  so  victory would have been Oyamas a whole week sooner and with more decisive re sults  The criticism is a true breath of the spirit of modern war To the strategist and tactician the great lesson of the Manchurian Cam paign is the overwhelming value of the whole army from general to private being permeated with offensive purpose with the fixed determination to win by attacking A policy of masterly retreat spells masterly failure Victory alone can justify and compen sate for the immense sacrifices of men and money which a nation makes when it commits its cause to the bloody arbitrament of war Yet victory ever shuns the embraces of troops taught to look back over their shoulders But for the two great AngloSaxon communities east and west of the Atlantic so proud and confident in their population in their wealth and in their mighty possessions the Manchurian Cam paign sounds also another and even graver note of warning the warning that the richest and seemingly the most powerful states 12 The Battle of the Scha Ho with nine maps and three appendices authorized translation by Karl von Donat late Lieutenant

War 747 may meet with sudden and deep humiliation if national preparation for defence is neglected and the spirit of selfsacrifice for the national good subordinated to the desire for individual comfort individual ease and socalled individual freedom The evil effect of pure individualism is we may gladly admit more and more fully recognized by AngloSaxon democracies as regards the internal life of a nation but it is still obstinately ignored as regards its external relations especially and above all as regards the duty of that per sonal military service upon the performance of which the con tinuance of the existence of the nation may depend A BRITISH OFFICER ADDENDUM The articles concluded above by a British military officer of high rank having been confined to the consideration of books printed either originally or as translations in the English language effort has been made to supplement them by such information as American readers are likely to desire concerning the most important of those books which at present exist only in Japanese and Russian I By the kindness of LieutenantColonel Kazutsugu Inouye I J A and of Commander Tokutaro Hiraga I J N Military and Naval Attaches respectively to the Imperial Japanese Embassy in Washington the managing editor is able to add the following notes respecting the Japanese publications upon the great war I It was the custom of the imperial government for the in formation of the general public to publish after each battle or im portant military operation an official report which while naturally not disclosing data regarded as confidential could be relied upon to be correct so far as it went These reports were presently made up into four thin volumes printed in Japanese under a title which may be translated Collection of Official Reports on the RussoJap anese War and published in Tokyo by ShinbashidoShoten 2 The reports from the front by correspondents who were allowed to accompany the Japanese armies were subjected to an inspection which while it resulted in the withholding of certain information at any rate gave guarantees against amateurish errors A series of these in twentyfour small volumes under a title which may be translated Stories of the RussoJapanese War has been published in Tokyo by Hakubunkan and is perhaps the best of the unofficial or publishers histories of the war748 A British Officer 3 The General Staff of the Japanese army has in preparation a work much more important than these called The History of the RussoJapanese War Army which will be chiefly documentary in character will extend to about fourteen volumes and will probably begin to appear at some time in I9II 4 Meanwhile publication of The Naval History of the Russo Japanese War prepared by the Naval General Staff has already begun by the issue in I909 of three octavo volumes of narrative text Tokyo Shunyodo embracing many illustrations and excellent maps This work which is now being translated into English will be completed by the addition of four more volumes consisting chiefly of documents As no war correspondents were allowed upon the Japanese ships this official history of course stands alone 5 Without knowledge of Japanese students and readers may derive great enjoyment from inspection of The RussoJapanese War taken by the Photographic Department of the Imperial Head quarters Tokyo

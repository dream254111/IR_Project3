Canal will find immediate and universal acceptance in the United States else it is doubtful if the canal would be opened Accord ing to him the waterway is merely a huge monument to a course of miscon

has spent a tremendous sum of money on a work which will never pay the expenses of maintenance and operation let alone the cost of construction BRISSENDEN PAUL F The Launching of the Industrial Workers of the World Pp 82 Berkeley University of California Press 1913 This interesting short study presents a mass of testimony on the begin nings of the Syndicalist movement in the United States It reviews the pre liminaries to the calling of the first convention of the Industrial Workers of the World in 190405 The various groups and elements represented at the convention in June 1905 are carefully analyzed and tabulated The bibli ography comprising almost onefourth of the pamphlet is complete and val uable This list of magazines and newspapers of the present labor move ment is particularly useful to the student while to the layman the existence of this amount of material will come as a distinct surprise BROWN SAMUEL W Secularization of American Education Pp 160 Price 150 New York Teachers College Columbia University This is a Teachers College thesis and is a review of the state legislation state constitutional provisions and state supreme court decisions by means of which the present secularization of education exists It traces in a number of chapters the history of education in America from the day when the aim was almost entirely religious through the stage when the aim and control were both religious and secular to the present condition where state institutions are entirely secular both in fact and theory In every state of the Union there exists now a system of public education in which civic and industrial aims are dominant in which religious instfuction is either entirely eliminated or else reduced to the barest and most formal elements and the control of which is 225THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY invested wellnigh exclusively in the state The author thinks that the two fac tors which have brought about the change are an educated citizenship neces sary to the existence of a republic and religious opinion which is an individual right The book is a valuable reference to one interested in the evolution of a system of education and the controversy between church and state in their efforts to control and determine the same BURKE E J Political Economy Pp xvi 479 Price 150 New York American Book Company 1913 This book written by a professor in a Catholic university is designed for use in Catholic colleges high schools and academies Though no particular effort has been made to introduce Catholic dogma or teaching yet the special feature of the book is the presentation of the Catholic doctrine whenever the subjects treated touch upon the domain of ethics Naturally frequent ref erence is made to the encyclical rerum novarum The treatment of the elementary principles of economics is prefaced by an account of the various schools of political economy Among the more im portant principles of the Catholic school are The right of private property in the means of production the right of private individual productive energy toleration of the differences of classes in society without the bitter opposition now existing between them the rejection of the LaissezFaire principle of the liberal school which errs in insisting almost exclusively on the rights of the individual and the carrying on of strenuous warfare against the Socialist doctrine which would subvert the present order of society and would it is claimed subject the laborer to even greater slavery than Socialists claim now to exist since under Socialism laborers would be dependent for their labor and place of work upon the will of the community CANNON IDA M Social Work in Hospitals Pp xi 257 Price 150 New York Survey Associates Inc 1913 The author of this volume has had an unusual opportunity to know and understand the possibilities of social service work in connection with hospi tals She has long been the head worker of the social service department of the Massachusetts General Hospital in immediate association with Dr Rich ard Cabot the pioneer in this field A year ago Miss Cannon had the oppor tunity to visit a number of institutions and observe various methods of work This book is designed to furnish not merely information about the movement but definite instruction with reference to the handling of different types of problems that arise in connection with the hospital Thus the three chapters on medicalsocial problems form the real backbone of the volume There are also excellent chapters on basis of treatment working together records or ganization workers together with many sample forms that may be used for recording work done The volume will be helpful to all who are engaged in this work and is to be particularly commended to the managers of hospitals who may have in mind the introduction of this department 226BOOK DEPARTMENT Comparative Prices Canada and the United States 19061911 Pp 316 Ot

clear and concise manner the rate bases or structures upon which railroad tariffs are built After a brief and unimportant introduction to the volume the railroad rates prevailing from trunk line and New England territory to Canada and the West are explained This is followed by a discussion of the rail and lake rates from the trunk line territory west Subsequent sections of the book take up in turn rates from the Central Freight Association territory and from the South and West The book is a valuable guide to those seeking to understand how the rate systems prevailing between practically all sections of the United States have been worked out It is a book for reference rather than for reading DAVIS WILLIAM WATSON The Civil War and Reconstruction in Florida Pp xxvi 769 Price 450 New York Longmans Green and Company 1913 This volume presents a detailed analysis of the course of the political history of Florida from 1860 to 1876 The work is divided into four parts the first giving a brief history of Florida before 1860 and an account of the origin and development of the secesson movement the second dealing with the mil itary events and the political and economic conditions during the war the third and fourth describing the stormy period of reconstruction with the con flict of federal and local authority the domination of the alliance of the car petbagger the scalawag and the negro the reign of lawlessness and crime and the eventual return of the Democratic party to power The history of the events which stand out as landmarks in the progress of the conflict between the free and the slave states has been adequately writ ten Of the work of filling in the gapsanalyzing local sentiment describing minor details and showing the effects of the struggle on the everyday life of the peoplemuch remains to be done Professor Davis has made a note worthy contribution to the growing number of monographs which are being written with this purpose in view It is such studies as this which will con stitute the material from which may be derived an interpretation and an ex planation of the great conflict DEGVILLE HOWARD Imperial Defence and Closer Union Pp xl 312 Price 76 London P S King and Son 1913 MITRA S M AngloIndian Studies Pp xxxv 525 Price 250 New York Longmans Green and Company 1913 Mr DEgville has very skillfully used the literary remains and political activities of Sir John Colomb a retired captain of the royal marine artillery and member of Parliament for some sixteen years following 1869 to show the evolution and status of the program of British imperial defense as based on 2272THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY the sea power Colomb was a modern pioneer in the movement to exalt the naval power idea over a defensive military policy favored by the British gov ernment and had a large part in instituting the reforms that led to the crea tion in 1904 of the imperial defense committee The later work of this committee and of various conferences for imperial organization and the expo sition of the principles for which Colomb contended are well presented in five chapters Two are given to the policy and principles of this defense two to the imperial co6peration which conditions its success and one to the imperial representation and union which should result The author of the second work a native Hindu who has lived eight years in England and won recognition as an interesting writer on Indian subjects brings together in his volume sixteen miscellaneous articles some of which have previously appeared in the English reviews Their value is in showing the native attitude to certain British administrative and other problems in India Mr Mitra writes as a Hindu and an imperialist He believes the safeguard of the empire lies in maintaining a balance between Hindu and Mos lem subjects on the divide and rule principle In the transfer of the capital to Delhi and in the English policy as to the Balkan troubles he sees undue Moslem influence He deprecates any democratic movement such as for colonial selfgovernment as contrary to the aristocratic spirit of the native princes who rule something like a third of India DUTTON

chil dren There were eight unions where fathers were feebleminded and mothers normal result ten normal and ten defective children In fortyone cases where both of the parents were feebleminded there were 222 degenerate children and two normal Feeblemindedness has been defined as irregular failure of development Dr Goddards cases seem to prove this for they present a great variation in the degree of development and many varieties of social irregularity His work emphasizes the fact that all cases of true amentia must be early recog nized by state authority if any progress is to be made in its suppression The Vineland institution and Dr Goddard have placed all the world under obli gations by this painstaking study of the heredity of feeblemindedness HART ALBERT B Social and Economic Forces

perspective of the entire field because of interest in some smaller portion thereof 230BOOK DEPARTMENT HOLMES JOHN H Marriage and Divorce Pp 63 Price 50 cents New York B W Huebsch 1913 This book is written for popular reading and is an effort to steer a safe and sane course between the theories of the Sacramentarians who view marriage as indissoluble and the Libertarians or Individualists who regard the matter purely from an individual point of view and believe in absolute freedom of divorce The author believes that when marriage is morally ended it should be legally ended but would throw around marriage all the moral social and economic safeguards which will make for its continuance The tone of the book is earnest rational and constructive HUGHAN JESSIE WALLACE The Facts of Socialism Pp 175 Price 75 cents New York John Lane Company 1913 ADAMS EDWARD F The Inhumanity of Socialism Pp 61 Price 100 San Francisco Paul Elder and Company 1913 Dr Hughan has set for herself the task of presenting in simple form the data as to the movement in our country calling itself Socialism its rela tion to Marx labor unionism the family the church the state its ultimate program its immediate platform its leaders organization and present poli cy She has done this well and has written an interesting little volume de fending Socialism Each chapter is followed by a short list of suggested read ings and a number of suggested topics for reports and discussions As a book for beginners and as text book for courses in Socialism it should prove valuable The Inhumanity of Socialism shows clearly that the author has not in recent years read much Socialistic or AntiSocialistic literature of which the world is full p 3 Mr Adams entire attack is based on the assumption that Socialism will entirely remove the driving force of selfishness and con sequently is not worthy of any further consideration He feels that not only must we retain the struggle for existence but implies that it should be greatly intensified Socialism is open to attack on many grounds it is unfortunate that the premises from which an attack is made should themselves be so very weak JEBB RICHARD The Britannic Question Pp 262 Price 35 cents New York Longnans Green and Company 1913 The author defines the Britannic question as the problem of how to effect a closer and permanent union between the selfgoverning states p 9 The problem is first given an historical and a philosophical setting and then alternative solutions are considered at length Imperial federation as one possibility soon strikes its colors under Mr Jebbs energetic treatment to a policy of alliance of the autonomous states of the empire Separate consid eration is given to the effect the two systems might be expected to have on the dependencies and the work concludes with a criticism of the recent pro nouncements on the imperial question by Mr Borden and by Mr Bonar Law Although written with an avowed bias the book is an instructive and stimulat ing slummary of a controverted issue 231THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY JOHNSTON R M Bull RunIts Strategy and Tactics Pp xiv 293 Price 250 Boston Houghton Mifflin Company

of this volume is the rational explanation of the origin conditions and effects of Prestige He defends it not as a logical moral or aesthetic phenomenon derived from mystical sources but a purely sociopsychological influence Book I traces the origin of the word from praestigiae meaning delusion and its connection with ideas of mystery and juggling through its modification till at last it comes to mean the favorable appearance of one man in the eyes of another Its atmosphere is perma nency large numbers exaggerated distances between men and the receptivity of the masses A discussion of racial and individual characters of recipients closes this part Book II treats of the possessors of prestige its values means utility etc Book III is the practical portion of the book in which the influences of prestige in love economic life religion politic brute force intellect and abnormality is traced with rare sagacity The volume is a constructive and brilliant psychological investigation of an important phenomenon in social life and should take rank among the valu able treatises on social psychology LONGUET JEAN Le Mouvement Socialiste International Pp 648 Paris Aristide Quillet 1913 In this volume we have a very valuable and timely contribution to lit erature of Socialism Many have been the books defending or attacking so cialistic practice and theory but a careful study of the extent and size of the movement such as here given has been lacking After a short historical sketch of the international and of the present International Socialist Bureau at Brussels the author gives us the standing of the socialist parties in every part of the globe In the study of each country there is a short historical review and then a discussion of present plans policies leaders and prospects The short bibliography that is appended is suggestive 232BOOK DEPARTMENT LOWNHAUPT FREDERICK What an Investor Ought to Know Pp 152 Price 100 New York Magazine of Wall Street 1913 A very elementary little volume of 152 pages discussing the position of holders of corporate bonds the idea of diversification of investments the most important factors governing safety of bond investments and the use of railroad and industrial reports as indices of the inherent worth of securities While it is believed that the author could have stated his ideas in a much small er space or in the same space included a much more valuable book it is un doubtedly true that investors often ignore or are ignorant of the few element ary principles explained and for this reason there is a real need for books of this kind which devote considerable space to the consideration of a few very fundamental ideas LUDWIG ERNEST Consular Treaty Rights and Comments on the Most Fa vored Nation Clause Pp 239 Akron The New Werner Company 1913 This brief by the consul for AustriaHungary at Cleveland Ohio presents the argument in favor of the exercise by foreign consuls of the right to admin ister the estates of their countrymen dying intestate in the United States The cases which have been decided in eleven states are reviewed an analysis is made especially of the decision of the United States supreme court in the case In re Rocca vs Thompson and a comparison is given of the American and European interpretations of the most favored nation clause as applied to the special subject under consideration The thesis argued is that since the treaty with Sweden proclaimed March 20 1911 consuls have the right to be appointed as administrators and that the clause allowing them to exercise this power so far as the laws of each country will permit does not act as a limitation Therefore it is concluded that where the state has created a pub lic administrator to handle such cases the state law must yield to the treaty and a fortiori the consul possesses the right in states where the statutes make no such provision MATIENZO JOSE NICOLAS Le Gouvernement Representatif Federal dans la Re

gives much space to Gabriel Thomas IIistorieal and geographical account of Pennsylvania and West NewJersey 1698 and to the circumstantial biographical description of Pennsylvania by Francis Daniel

HANDLEY The FrancoGerman War Indemnity and Its Economic Results Pp x 80 Price Is London Harrison and Sons 1913 All who have read Norman Angells The Great Illusion will be interested in this study of the chapter in that volume entitled The Indemnity Futility The Garton Foundation and its work deserve to be better known because of the undoubted value of such a movement in furthering the cause of interna tional peace The author of this small volume does not differ from Mr Angell in his general attitude but arrives at much the same conclusions in a dif ferent manner The chief point at issue is whether the payment of the in demnity by France was the primary cause of Germanys economic troubles in the following decade Mr OFarrell finds other causes more potent and concludes that the indemnity played but a small part if any in aggravat ing the financial troubles under which Germany in common with the rest of the world suffered while it actually conferred some benefits OSBORNE ALGERNON A Speculation on the New York Stock Exchange Sep tember 1904March 1907 Pp 172 Price 100 New York Long mans Green and Company 1913 This is an interesting but rather superficial discussion of the lack of any thing which tends to bring the volume of speculation in different stocks in to approximate conformity with investment buying or selling and is an out growth of the theory that speculation in security markets in general and on the New York Stock Exchange in particular causes business depressions as contrasted with the idea of speculators whose actions are the result of coming conditions which they foresee As a criticism of the foolish who purchased at the high prices existing before the 1907 panic and a description of market conditions at this time this book is excellent but to assume that the buyers were all speculators and the investors all wise men and draw the conclusion that speculators are therefore lacking in that rare judgment and discounting ability attributed to them is unwarranted That some misjudged future conditions in 190607 is certainthat they were the speculators in the Wall street sense of the term the author has utterly failed to show 234BOOK

is usually a crude index of public interest in the material presented If this is true in this particular field and observation seems to confirm such a view then there is an increasing interest on the

author of this little volume Dr Stelzle has grouped in 240 pages a usable mass of informa tion which ought to be of great value to ministers and laymen not only in in creasing practical knowledge but

thinks as a temporary make shift but the ultimate goal is an imperial parliament where all the constitu 236BOOK DEPARTMENT ent parts of the empire have representation an imperial executive of the cabi net type and an imperial supreme court This federation is to have a written constitution which the author supplies The federation thus organized is then informed how to manage properly its most important business including naval and military defense finance taxation emigration the tariff and the diplomatic service The method of treatment is purely speculative The government of an imaginary

Social Revolutions Pp vii 240 Price 125 New York The Macmillan Company 1913 The mind of the complacent lawyer who holds the traditional attitude toward legal interpretation will receive something of a shock upon reading this book The author is not temperamentally a sensationalist and with a legal training and practice covering more than twentyfive years we have reason to regard his utterances as the result of deep conviction A casual reading of the book confirms this supposition His studies have not been con fined to the mere technique of legal procedure and the perusal of precedents but have gone deeply into the social political and economic forces which shape public opinion and mould law The present volume is an exposition of the conclusions which are the product of these experiences But

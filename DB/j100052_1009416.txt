of the Peabody Donation Fund the purpose of which is to provide improved housing for the workingclasses of London gives an interesting account of the operations of this large philanthropic trust Mr George Peabody gave 750ooo for this purpose in 1862 5ooooo in 1866 5ooooo in 1868 and bequeathed 750000 on his death in 1873 The capital sum given was thus 25ooooo Additions of rent and interest have now brought this up to 5846694 16 The housing accommodations provided consist of blocks of build ings containing in all 11367 rooms exclusive of bath rooms laundries and lavatories There are 76 tenements of 4 rooms 1791 of 3 rooms 2436 of 2 rooms and 818 of I room The number of persons in resi dence on December 31 last was 19914 The average rental per room was 54 cents per week and the average weekly earnings per family 582 The birthrate for the year was 369 per Iooo or 64 per iooo above that of all London and the death rate 179 per Iooo or 19 per Iooo below the metropolitan rate The infant mortality was 151 I per iooo births or I47 below that of London The net earnings were 23 per cent or Y of I per cent below the usual average This result was due to unusual expenditure in drain age and other improvements and to a rise of 2000 in local taxes The loss from empty tenements during the year amounted to 1930 and from bad debts 28125 Both together amount to but  of I per cent of the rents received Improved Housing of the PoortThe Department of Dwellings of the New York Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor is charged by the constitution of that society with the duty of looking after the sanitary inspection of tenement houses with the planning and building of model dwellings and with the promotion or formation of cooperative building societies The recently published reports of the New York Tenement House Committee and of the United States Department of Labor have awakened a new interest in the question of better tenements and dwellings for wageearners With such a vast body of material the time was ripe for a practical discussion of some  From information received from Prof E R L Gould of Johns Hopkins University t Prepared from notes submitted by Dr William H Tolmnan of New York 512SOCIOLOGICAL NOTES 137 reform measures and the Department of Dwellings of the New York Association arranged for a two days conference with the object of inaugurating a plan which should commend itself to the best judg ment of the experts in housing The formation of some kind of a building company is the undisputed outcome of the conference and one member of the Association pledged himself for the expense of a secretary for one year for the express purpose of formulating and administering definite lines of action About two hundred persons attended the sessions of the conference among them some of the lead ing business men of New York City The first half of both days was spent in visiting various offices and institutions in New York City including the Mayors office street cleaning department peoples baths police headquarters college and university settlements im proved tenements wayfarers lodges etc Afternoon and evening sessions were held for purposes of discussion Mayor Strong presided at one of the meetings and Bishop Potter at another Professor E R L Gould who prepared the eighth special report of the United States Bureau of Labor discussed the question Will Improved Housing Pay  He presented a vast amount of carefully prepared information to show that present experience demonstrates that 88 per cent of such experiments are earning profits equal to or beyond the ordinary rate for safe investments Mr Cornelius F Doody of the Industrial Temperance Union explained the plan of that society for the erection of small detached cottages upon land purchased in the outlying districts Mr John Lloyd Thomas who had just spent two months abroad studying the municipal experiments in Glasgow and London presented a comprehensive paper giving the results of those experiments He expressed the opinion that the two mammoth lodging houses about to be erected in New York by Mr D O Mills will offer facilities equal to those found in any other city Mr Mills has destroyed two of the worst slums in New York and will erect on these sites the best constructed modern buildings in which there will be accommodations for 2250 lodgers who will be given comforts equal to the best afforded in the British model houses and at a cost of from fifteen to twenty cents a night The erection of these houses will be commenced in May and it is expected that they will be open for use by January 1897 Dr Albert Shaw discussed the topic  Facts and Tendencies of Transit Facilities in Their Relation to the Housing Problem and Professor Felix Adler spoke on the moral aspects of the question Mr Robert Treat Paine of Boston gave a rdsumi of his personal ex periments in building about one hundred small brick houses in Boston in the years 1887 to I890 all of which were sold on easy terms of 5 13138 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY credit in some cases cash payments being made in the form of a monthly rent ExMayor Hewitt discussed the possibilities of more extended work on the part of building associations and in general the application of the building association idea The immediate results of the conference especially the impres sions made on those who attended it were encouraging The feeling generally prevailed that something practical for the improvement of dwellings of wageearners in New York City could be done at once and that any scheme undertaken should be made a model of its kind which might in turn influence other cities A strong general com mittee was appointed which is now organized under the name of Improved Housing Council The services of a general agent for one year will be secured as soon as possible Detailed plans for dwellings are being submitted and carefully examined by the committees of the Council Professor E R L Gould has agreed to spend the month of April in New York City and will devote some time to laying out the work for the coming year In addition to the executive committee two subcommittees have been appointed one on  Model Tenement Houses under the chairmanship of Mr Joseph S Auerbach the other on  Separate Dwellings with Professor Felix Adler as chair man In this way the two general schemes around which most prac tical plans for building dwellings may be readily grouped will each be given due weight and examination under the leadership of their respective advocates Liquor Legislation in New YorkThe Raines Bill The new liquor tax law in New York which was partially put in force imme diately after it received the governors signature has already produced a marked change in New York City It abolishes the Boards of Excise after April 30 and provides for the appointment of a State Commis sioner of Excise to be appointed by the Governor for a term of five years It provides also for a deputy commissioner a secretary and necessary clerical force and for special deputy commissioners in cer tain counties New York Kings and Erie The Commissioner has power to appoint not more than sixty special agents each of whom receives an annual salary of 1200 They are to be the confidential agents of the State Commissioner and to investigate all matters relat ing to the collection of liquor taxes The State Commissioner is also authorized to designate in any county an attorney or attorneys to act with the special deputy in the prosecution of all actions or proceed ings under any law repealed by this act or in the prosecution or defence of any action brought under the provisions of the act Licenses are abolished and a liquor tax substituted The tax receipts must be publicly exhibited just as street railway tax receipts 5141SOCIOLOGICAL NOTES 139 are postcd in the cars Anyone may engage in the liquor business who qualifies by paying the tax for the kind of business he may under take These taxes are assessed in four classes First hotels restau rants saloons stores etc where liquor is to be drunk upon the premises where it is sold located in a city having by the last State census a population of 1500000 or more must pay 80o if in a city having less than I5ooooo but more than 500000 650 if in a city having less than 500ooo but more than 50000 500 in places with less than 50ooo but more than Ioooo 350 in places with less than Io ooo but more than 5000 300 in a village with less than 50o00 but more than 1200 200 and in other places i00 Second Upon the business of trafficking in liquors in quantities of less than five wine gallons no part of which shall be drunk on the premises where sold the tax begins with 5oo for cities of over 1500oco and is graded down to 50 Third For licensed pharmacies where liquors are sold only upon the written prescription of a physician the tax is Ioo for cities with a population of 1500000 or more and graded down to io for places with less than 1200 Fourth Those holding licenses for cars steamboats or vessels within the State where liquor is sold to be drunk on the spot the tax is 200 for each car steamboat or vessel upon which the traffic is carried on The bill further grants full measure of local option in determining in any town whether liquor shall be sold at all or which class of taxreceipt may be granted Traffic in liquor is not permitted in any building owned by the public or upon any premises established as a penal institution protectory industrial school asylum State hospital or poorhouse and if such premises be situated in a town and outside the limits of an incorporated village or city not within onehalf mile of the premises so occupied nor in any building yard booth or other place which shall be on the same street or avenue and within 200 feet of a spot occupied exclusively as a church or schoolhouse Sales of liquor are not permitted on Sunday or before five a m on Monday or on any other day between one and five oclock in the morning or on election days or within 200 yards of the grounds or premises upon which any State county town or other agricultural or horticultural fair is being held unless such grounds are within the limits of a city containing 150000 inhabitants Holders of licenses are prohibited from selling any adulterated liquor or to give away any food to be eaten on hIe premises and must not allow any girl or woman not a member of the family of the proprietor to sell or serve any liquor upon the premises It is not 5151140 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY lawful to have open or unlocked any door or entrance from the street alley yard hallway room or adjoining premises to the room or rooms where any liquors are sold during the hours when the sale of liquors is forbidden except when necessary for the use of the family and for purposes not forbidden by the act No curtain screen blind opaque or colored glass or anything that obstructs the view from the side walk of the bar or place where the liquors are sold is permissible during the hours when the sale of liquors is forbidden The usual provisions against the sale of liquor to minors intoxicated persons habitual drunkards are included in the law which further prohibits selling or giving away any liquors to any Indian or to any person to whom proprietors may be forbidden to sell by notice in writing from the parent guardian husband wife or child of such person over sixteen years of age or by a magistrate or overseer of the poor in cases where the person is wholly or partly a charge upon the town and in general to persons confined or committed to a State prison jail reformatory industrial school hospital asylum or poor house except upon a written prescription from a physician The act makes no exception in favor of clubs as to Sunday sales There was much confusion in connection with the passage of the act in the New York Legislature and many disgraceful scenes enacted Some doubt existed in the public mind whether the law went into effect on Sunday March 29 which was the first day succeeding its passage on which it could be tested or whether its provisions became opera tive on April 30 It was very generally enforced however on March 29 with very satisfactory results from the point of view of temperance reform The law is doubtless more severe in some of its provisions than the public sentiment of New York City will sustain Its local option feature gives expression to the only just and prac ticable scheme of reform but is perhaps in the present law too restricted in its application Senator Raines has discussed some of the underlying principles of the new law in an article in the North American Review for April Condition of the Colored Population in Large CitiesThe Committee on  Housing of the People  of the Civic Centre of Wash ington D C is about to enter upon an investigation of the alley houses of Washington which are for the most part inhabited by colored people Two elaborate schedules containing about one hundred inquiries have been prepared and the work of enumeration will soon be begun A similar work will be undertaken in Philadelphia in the near future through the combined agencies of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and the College Settlement This investigation will also be conducted on the schedule plan and be 5 6SOCIOLOGICAL NOTES 14I restricted entirely to the question of the condition of the colored population of Philadelphia and with reference to inequalities of op portunity in employment It is highly desirable that similar work in other cities shall be carried on wherever possible in a way that whenever undertaken will yield comparable results This department of the ANNAIS is always glad to facilitate com munication between parties engaged in practical investigations of sociological topics and will therefore be pleased to furnish further information concerning the special colored investigation mentioned in this connection and to receive suggestions from persons engaged in a similar work elsewhere Tuskegee Conference of 1896The annual gathering of those interested in the cause of industrial education for the negro took place at Tuskegee on Thursday March 5 About seven hundred persons were in attendance and thirteen States represented At these con ferences nothing is attempted but the discussion of the most vital and practical questions which have to do with the material advance ment of the negroes of the South Every effort is made to instill into them the necessity of saving of keeping out of debt of improv ing and owning their own homes of being less wasteful in their expenditures and of keeping their schools open for a longer period than the average two or three months term Great care is taken to present to these colored people many of whom are leaders in the localities from which they come the opportunities in new employ ments and to assist them in the development of those qualities which will prevent many employments once monopolized by the race from slipping out of their hands especially where white men have entered into competition with all the advantage which cultivated brains and modern scientific methods afford About fifty negro schools were represented at this conference The reports are always full of charac teristic pictures of the life of the colored people of the South Copies of the report may be obtained from Mr Booker T Wash ington the principal of the Tuskegee Normal School Tuskegee Alabama  Darkest England  SchemeThe annual report for the calen dar year 1895 of General Booths work as certified by the accountants shows that 18ooo was received from the public and 3oooo earned in the various workshops 1352840 persons were lodged at prices varying from Id to 6d per night and 3302763 meals were sold vary ing in price from Y4d to 4d each 3273 men were employed in the factories and shops operated by the organization 15923 applications for work were registered at the Labor Bureau and employment tem porary or permanent was found for nearly 20o0oo men The Prison 517142 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY Home received 156 persons and the rescue homes 1556 women of whom it is said 1275 were satisfactorily dealt with Out of the 3740 men received into the workshops lo41 were discharged because they were unable or unwilling to work or dissatisfied In all i40o men and women are now employed in connection with the scheme and all of them are said to be of the working class that it was intended to benefit At the farm only io per cent of those received had to be sent away because of drunkenness or persistent idleness

agentForfeitureEstoppel Where the general agent of an insurance company to write and deliver policies applies to a policyholder to renew his policy which he has been carrying for several years and is informed by the policyholder that he has contracted to sell the property and has put the purchaser in possession and received a part of the purchase money stating how much is still due and giving full particulars as to the condition of his title and ownership and the agent without any written application thereupon writes and delivers a policy on the buildings which he declares is sufficient to meet the situation disclosed the company is estopped to assert a forfeiture of the policy by reason of provisions contained therein rendering it void if the interest of the assured be other than the unconditional and sole ownership unless otherwise pro vided by agreement endorsed on the policy and providing that no offi cer or agent of the company can waive any condition of the policy except by agreement in writing endorsed on or annexed to the policy The conduct of the agent estops the company from asserting the for feiture 2 FIRE INSURANCEForfeitureWaiver Conditions in a fire insurance policy which are inserted for the benefit of the insurer the breach of which may operate a forfeiture may be waived by the insurer or his lawful agent 3 INSURANCE POLICYConditionsNotice of conditionsPolicy as notice Waiver An agent may waive conditions in an insurance policy not withstanding inhibitions contained in the policy unless the assured has actual notice of the limitations placed upon the agents powers either by having his attention called to the inhibitions contained in the policy or otherwise The mere fact that the policy contains the restrictive provision is not of itself sufficient to affect the assured with notice Error to a judgment of the Circuit Court of the City of Rich mond rendered in a proceeding by motion for a judgment after notice in writing wherein the defendant in error was the plaintiff and the plaintiff in error was the defendant Affirmed The opinion states the case  Reported by M P Burks State Reporter 9819 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Leake  Carter for the plaintiff in error Munford Huntoin Williams  Anderson and Lewis C Williams for the defendant in error WHITTLE J delivered the opinion of the court This was a proceeding by motion in the Circuit Court of the city of Richmond by the defendant in error the Richmond Mica Company against the plaintiff in error the Virginia Fire  Marine Insurance Company upon a fire insurance policy to recover the sum of 1500 loss occasioned the plaintiff from the destruction by fire of certain of the property covered by the policy The policy contains among others the following provisions 1 This entire policy unless otherwise provided by agree ment indorsed hereon or added hereto shall be void   if the interest of the insured be other than unconditional and sole owner ship or if the subject of insurance be a building on ground not owned by the insured in fee simple 2 This policy is made and accepted subject to the foregoing stipulations and conditions together with such other provisions agreements or conditions as may be endorsed hereon or added here to and no officer agent or other representative of this company shall have power to waive any provision or condition of this policy except such as by the terms of this policy may be the subject of agreement endorsed hereon or added hereto and as to such provisions or condi tions no officer agent or representative shall have such power or be deemed or held to have waived such provisions or conditions unless such waiver if any shall be written upon or attached hereto nor shall any privilege or permission affecting the insurance under this policy exist or be claimed by the insured unless so written or attached Plaintiff in error denies liability for the loss on the ground that at the date of the policy the interest of the assured in the property was other than the unconditional and sole ownership and that the building destroyed was not located on ground owned by the assured in fee simple and that there had been no waiver of the forfeiture which accrued from the breach of the condition of the policy in the manner and upon the terms prescribed in the second provision and the entire policy was therefore void and of no effect There was a demurrer to the evidence which the trial court over 982 March1904 VIRGINIA FIRE ETC CO V RICHMOND MICA CO ruled and rendered judgment for the plaintiff for the damages provisionally assessed by the jury and the case is here on writ of error to that judgment It is conceded that if the insurance company is liable at all the amount of the recovery is correct but as remarked the company denies liability in toto for the reason stated It appeared in evidence that R A Lancaster Jr was the gen eral agent of the insurance company for thecity of Richmond that during a series of years he had received the premiums and written insurance upon the property in question for the defendant in error in the company of his principal that these policies were renewed from year to year it being the practice of the agent before the expiration of a former policy to write insurance upon the property for the ensuing year to deliver the policy to L M Williams the secretary and treasurer of the assured and collect the premiums from him There was no written application for any of this insur ance and no information with respect to the property was demanded of the assured Lancaster solicited the risk wrote the insurance received the premiums and in fine was alone known to the assured throughout the transaction In accordance with custom in the latter part of the year 1902 Lancaster approached Williams for the purpose of renewing the insurance for the year 1903 when he was informed by Williams that the Richmond Mica Company had contracted in writing to sell the property to one Mersereau and had placed him in posses sion of it that Mersereau had paid part of the purchase price but owed a balance on the property of 340243 which when paid or secured to be paid would entitle him to a conveyance Having thus voluntarily made a full and fair disclosure of the state of the title of his principal Williams requested Lancaster to write the insurance so as to meet the exigencies of the case Whereupon Lancaster assured him that it was not necessary to alter the policy as it had been prepared by him that when the title to the property was transferred to Mersereau it would be time enough to make the change Acting upon that information and assurance the premlun was paid and the policy accepted as filled up by Lancaster The status quo of all parties was maintained until May 30 1903 when the property was destroyed by fire In its proof of loss the assured having again called attention to its contract with 9839 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Mersereau the insurance company denied liability and tendered the amount of the premium to Williams who promptly declined to receive it On a similar state of facts this court has so often decided that the conduct of the agent estops the insurance company from assert ing the forfeiture relied on that it may be stated as established law in this jurisdiction In the case of The Georgia Home Insurance Co v Kinnier 28 Gratt 88 it was held that when a policy of insurance contained a condition that the policy should be vitiated if the premises became vacant by the removal of the owner or occu pant for a period of more than 20 days without immediate notice to the company and written consent it was competent for the insurer or its lawful agent to waive this condition and if at the time the agent of the company received the premium of insur ance and delivered the policy he had knowledge of the vacation of the property and did not then avoid the policy but treated it as valid and subsisting such conduct of the agent was a waiver of the condition and a breach of it could not be relied on by the company to defeat a recovery upon the policy In the case of McLean v Insurance Co 29 Gratt 372 the above case is cited as authority for the proposition that conditions in a policy which are for the benefit of the insurer the breach of which may operate a forfeiture may be waived by the insurer or his lawful agent The rules there laid down with respect to the doctrine of waiver and estoppel in such cases are followed and approved in Insurance Co v Weill 28 Gratt 389 26 Am Rep 364 Insurance Co v West 76 Va 578 44 Am Rep 177 Insurance Co v Teiger 90 Va 277 18 S E 195 Easley v Insurance Co 91 Va 169 21 S E 235 Insurance Co v Pankey 91 Va 259 21 N E 487 Insurance Co v Rodefer 92 Va 747 24 S E 393 53 Am St

cases the policies were standard policies identical in form with the one under consideration In Lynchburg Fire Insurance Co v West 76 Va 578 44 Anm Rep 177 the court recognizes the general rule that parol testi mony is inadmissible to vary or contradict written instruments 984 March1904 VIRGINIA FIRE ETC CO V RICHMOND MICA CO but holds that exceptions exist where the assured is misled by decla rations of the insurer or his agent where the insurer insists on forfeitures of his own creation where the insurer or his agent in preparing an application or policy fails to follow correct descrip tions given by the assured or where one uses his superior knowl edge or influence to mislead the other as to the true import of the contract Parol testimony is admissible in such instances it is said not to contradict the writing but by way of equitable estoppel to prevent its use It was also held in that case that the agents knowledge of the real condition of the risk is imputable to the principal and estops him from setting up any warranty inconsistent therewith Thus in Virginia Fire  Marine Insurance Co v Goode 95 Va 751 30 S E 366 the court held that what passed between an agent and the assured while filling out an insurance policy is admissible when offered not to contradict the policy but to show that a representation therein ought not to operate as an estoppel upon the assured In Mutual Fire Insurance Co v Ward 95 Va 231 28 S E 209 the court says at page 237 95 Va page 211 28 S E That knowl edge of a general agent who has power to receive and accept pro posals for risks subject to the approval and ratification of his principal to issue and deliver policies and renew and cancel the same will bind the company was decided by this court in the case of Georgia Home Insurance Co v Kinnier 28 Gratt 96   That facts communicated to the agent exercising powers thus enu merated though uncommunicated to his principal were held in the case of Lynchburg Fire Insurance Co v West supra to bind the Company there being no evidence to show that special limitations upon the power of the agent were known to the assured or were plainly to be inferred by him from the nature of the agents employment In Farmers etc Association v Williams 95 Va 248 28 S E 214 the following statement of the rule is quoted with approval from the opinion of Judge Cooley in the case of ziEtna Insurance Co v Olmstead 21 Mich 253 4 Am Rep 483 Where an agent who at the time and place is the sole representative of the prin cipal assumes to know what information the principal requires and after being furnished with all the facts drafts a paper 9859 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER which he declares satisfactory induces the other party to sign it receives and retains the premium moneys and then delivers a contract which the other party is led to believe and has a right to believe gives him the indemnity for which he paid his money we do not think the insurer can be heard in repudi ation of the indemnity on the ground of his agents unskill fulness carelessness or fraud If this can be done it is easy to see that the community is at the mercy of these insur ance agents who will have little difficulty in a large proportion of the cases in giving a worthless policy for the money they receive The following language from the leading case of Lynchburg Fire Insurance Co v West supra which was also quoted with approval by this court in the case last named is so apposite to the case in judgment that it may with propriety be repeated If the defendants were misled it was by their own agent and not by the plaintiff The latter honestly gave the agent all the information that was required of him He relied upon the agent to see that the business was correctly done according to the require ments of the company Called upon to make answers to certain interrogations he had the right to presume that the agent was competent to understand their meaning and effect as well as the meaning and effect of the provisions of the policy bearing upon the disclosures made The defendants ought not now to be heard to say that the agent of his own selection had exceeded his powers and that he had not communicated to them the facts made known to him by the plaintiff This is manifestly so unless it could be shown that special limitations upon the powers of the agent were known to the plaintiff or plainly appeared from the nature of his employment No such limitations upon the powers of the agent are brought home to the assured either in the application or otherwise As has been seen the assured gave full and explicit information with respect to its contract with Mersereau to Lancaster the gen eral agent of the insurance company and invoked his superior knowledge in the light of all the facts to write a policy which would afford the indemnity sought and to secure which the pre mium was paid Under these circumstances without the slightest suspicion of bad faith on the part of the assured the policy in question was prepared and delivered by Lancaster with the assur 986 March1904 VIRGINIA FIRE ETC CO V RICHMOND MICA CO ance that it met the necessities of the case and upon that assurance the assured acted and parted with the premium Between the delivery of the policy and the fire no change had taken place in the status of the property and not a dollar more of the purchase price had been paid by Mersereau and it is conceded that the assured had an insurable interest in the property far greater in value than the amount of the policy In the face of this undis puted testimony to permit the insurance company after loss to escape liability upon the pretext that one of the general provisions of a printed policy intended to cover every conceivable case had been violated would be in contravention of the decisions of this court from the case of West Rockingham Insurance Co v Sheets 26 Gratt 854 decided in November 1875 to the latest expression of the court on the subject found in the case of Union Assurance Society of London v Nails 101 Va 613 44 S E 896 decided in June 1903 In the case of The Wytheville Insurance  Banking Co v Teiger 90 Va 277 18 S E 195 the policy contained a provision that in any matter relating to this insurance no person unless duly authorized in writing shall be deemed the agent of this company and the court held When an insurance company clothes a person with apparent authority to deliver policies and receive premiums as was done in this case it is estopped after a policy is delivered as a valid contract to an innocent holder to set up the defense that the agent acted without written authority from the company Such a defense if sustained would operate as a gross fraud and can receive no countenance in a court of justice If in such case a waiver were not implied the delivery of the policy would be not only an unmeaning but a deceptive and fraudulent ceremony Citing Farnum v Phoenix Insurance Co 83 Cal 246 23 Pac 869 17 Am St Rep 233 Georgia Home Ins Co v Kinnier 28 Gratt 88 Manhattan Fire Insurance Co v Weill 28 Gratt 389395 26 Am Rep 364 Life Insurance Co v Miller 12 Wall 285 24 L Ed 410 2 May on Insurance 3d Ed section 360 and other authorities It was insisted on behalf of the insurance company that the decis ion in Sulphur Mines Co v Phcenix Insurance Co 94 Va 355 27 S E 24 is opposed to the doctrine contended for on behalf of the defendant in error An examination of that case however shows 9879 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER that the question raised here was not involved There the policy contained a provision that it should be void if the property was or should become incumbered unless consent thereto should be indorsed on the policy by an authorized agent of the insurance company The court held that such an incumbrance unknown to the company avoids the policy although it was not customary to make that inquiry when policies were issued to large corporations It was not pretended in that case that the agent who affected the insurance knew of the incumbrance or made any representation to the assured in regard to it It was therefore a breach by the assured of an express condition of the policy unaffected by extra neous circumstances and the court properly held that the policy was avoided It was also argued that the established doctrine of this court namely that an insurance company will not be heard to say that an agent of their own selection has exceeded his powers and lias not communicated to them facts made known to him by the assured is subject to the qualification unless it can be shown that special limitations upon the powers of the agent are kcnowa to the assured o plainly appear from the nature of the agents employment The contention is that a provision in a policy such as is contained in the policy in this case ipso facto carries notice of the restrictions on the powers of the agent home to the assured If that contention were true it would practically abrogate the doctrine of this court in all cases for the rule is predicated upon the fact that the dealings of the agent have been such that a policy which according to its letter was violated in its inception and void ab initio must be upheld on the ground that the agent has so dealt with the assured as to estop his principal from setting up and taking advantage of what would otherwise have operated a forfeiture The contention presents a striking illustration of arguing in a circle The insurance company it is said is estopped from relying upon the forfeiture prescribed by the policy by reason of the con duct of its agent which constitutes a fraud upon the rights of the assured but the assured cannot avail himself of the estoppel because to do so would contravene the provisions of the policy The true interpretation of the qualification of the rule is that the assured must have actual notice of the limitations placed upon the agents powers either by having his attention called to the stipu 988 Marcb1904 VIRGINIA FIRE ETC CO V RICHMOND MICA CO lation of the policy containing it or otherwise and not on the constructive notice afforded by the circumstance that the policy contains the limitation In May on Insurance Parsons Ed section 137 at page 244 Mr Parsons referring to decisions where it is held that in case of restrictions in the policy upon an agents power he cannot bind the company by acts in excess of such limitation says It seems very doubtful if the doctrine of these cases is entirely correct The assured has a right to suppose that a general agent has all the powers incident to his business unless he has knowledge to the contrary and usage may overcome the provisions of the policy Prudent men are accustomed to rely upon the acts and state ments of the agents and they should be protected in so doing  As to waivers taking place after issue it is very proper to require the assured to look at his policy and conform to it and the limita tions of the agents authority should be effective unless by a course of business or otherwise the company has waived the limitation on the agents power of waiver While it must be confessed there is great divergence of opinion on the subject the rule as stated by Mr Parsons is believed to be more in consonance with justice and reason and has been uniformly upheld by the decisions of this court for the past 30 years Mr Joyce in his admirable work on Insurance volume 1 section 439 after an exhaustive discussion of the subject and review of the authorities reaches the conclusion that an agent may waive condi tions notwithstanding the inhibition in the policy A strict adherence to the opposing theory would not only operate disastrously to the assured but to the business of the insurer as well for in the practical conduct of such business it would be impossible to submit every departure from the companys rules to the principal office or to the board of directors Much reliance has been placed by counsel for the plaintiff in error upon the opinion of Mr Justice Shiras in the case of Northern Assurance Co v Grand View Building Association 183 U S 308 23 Sup Ct 183 46 L Ed 214 reversing the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Eighth Circuit While the pronouncements of that great court must always com mand the highest respect its judgment in the particular case 989990 9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER March is deprived of much value as a precedent by the circumstance that it is not in harmony with many former decisions of that court and that the Chief Justice Mr Justice Harlan and Mr Justice Peckham did not concur in the opinion of the majority Since that decision was rendered Mr Justice Shiras has retired from the bench and been succeeded by Mr Justice Day who presided in the Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of Queen Insurance Co v Union Bank  Trust Co 111 Fed 699 49 C C A 555 where a different conclusion was reached So there are now on that bench at least four justices who entertain views opposed to those of the majority as expressed in the case referred to In this state of the law this court can hardly be expected to abandon its own wellconsidered precedents to follow the questionable ruling of another tribunal It follows from these views that the judgment complained of is without error and must be affirmed Affirmed EDITORIAL NOTEThe judgment in this case is worthy of note as a pro nouncement that the court will not only adhere to the spirit of its several rulings upon the subject in the pastand in the face of an opposite ruling by the United States Supreme Courtbut will illustrate this consistency by a step forward While it was asserted by counsel for appellee that the question of the validity and effect of the second clause in the policy con strued has not heretofore been passed upon by our appellate court yet in Union Assurance Society v Nails ante p 402 44 S E 896 decided in June 1903 and cited in the opinion the general result here was foreshadowed It was there held that the existence of a mortgage does not vitiate the condi tion of the policy that the interest of the insured in the property shall be unconditional and sole ownership The kernel of the case is stated in the citation from Lynchburg Fire Insur ance Co v West to be the rule as to the varying of written instruments by parol evidence and the exceptions to the rule The principal case adds another to the list of exceptions The spirit of the decision is unques tionably the doctrine of estoppel which like its sister in the equity courts is generally the length of the judges foot In our judgment it is all embraced in the words of the syllabus without any applicationan ele ment which pervades all of the rulings in point adverse to the insurance companies And there is much to be said for it too as may be seen at a glance from a perusal of the facts in the case Given an insistent solicitor a property owner a policy offered containing several thousand words of which no unscientific mind knows the meaning an assurance by the solicitor that everything will be all right and that the provisions are a mere form and we have a condition which the courts say they will examine closely at law or in equity and enforce the spirit of the resulting contract according1904 VIRGINIA FIRE ETC CO V RICHMOND MICA CO to the facts which they will ascertain by parol evidence in the face of the provisions or warranties of the policy It is an exception to the rule and under the circumstances of this case and the authorities cited it seems to us a just exception At the same time it can be carried too far Of course if one stipulation of a policy can be avoided by parol evidence another should receive the same treatment under generally similar circumstances and the question suggests itself What is the use of a policy or contract further than as a memorandum that on a certain day the minds of insurer and insured met upon a general agree ment for insurance at a certain premium in a specified maximum amount the details of which will be left open for determination after the casualty contemplated shall have occurred To our mind there is only one answer to the questionthat the courts must be trusted to deal with any contro versy that may arise between the parties according to the very right of the caseto so qualify and guard their utterances as to make one case a pre cedent only for such as may arise under circumstances substantially the sameto preservea proper mean between the extreme of enforcing a contract which affords the assured from the beginning no protection and the extreme which allows him to abuse the solicitude of the courts for his interests and make it the instrument for the introduction into the contract of ele ments which never existed We confess frankly that we cannot determine the location of this mean but we may trust the courts to do so as the several cases arise 991

J100587,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 16831775,101858,A DIOPTRICK PROBLEM WHY FOUR CONUEXGLASSES IN A TELESCOPE SHEW OBJECTS ERECT BY WILLIAM MOLINEUX OF DUBLIN ESQ R S SOC,I206881,169 A DIOPTRICK PROBLEM WHY FOUR CONVEXGLASSES IN A TELESCOPE SHEW OBJECTS ERECT BY WILLIAM MOLI NEUX OF DUBLIN ESQ R S SOC IN THE JOURNAL DES SCAVANS FOR MUNDAY THE 17TH OF SEP TEMBER 1685 PAG 466 AMST EDITION WE FIND THIS PAS SAGE AS PERSPECTIVES OF ONE CONVEXGLASS MAKE OBJECTS APPEAR UPRIGHT WHICH THOSE OF TWO CONVEXGLASSES INVERT AND AGAIN THOSE OF THREE RECTIFY SO IT SHOULD SEEM THAT THOSE OF FOUR OUGHT TO INVERT AND YET EXPERIENCE SHEWS US THAT OBJECTS APPEAR UP RIGHT THROUGH THESE GLASSES THE SINGULARITY OF THIS PHAENOMENON OBLIGES ALL SKILD IN DIOPTRICKS TO INQUIRE THE REASON THEREOF BUT HITHERTO THEY HAVE FOUND NONE MR REGIS WHO APPLIES HIMSELF PARTICULARLY TO THIS PART OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY BELEIVES THAT HE HAS HIT UPON THE REASON AND MAKES US HOPE THAT HE WILL SUDDENLY PUBLISH IT THUS FAR THE JOURNALBUT IT DOES NOT TELL US WHOSE REMARK THIS IS THOUGH I AM APT TO BELEIVE TWAS WRITTEN BY MR REGIS HIMSELF TO THE PUBLISHER OF THE JOURNAL TO ME THIS PHENOMENON APPEARS VERY EASILY EXPLICABLE FROM THE CONSIDERATION OF PLACING GLASSES IN A TUBE WHICH IS THUS AFTER THE OBJECTGLASS THE EYEGLASS IS PLACED SO MUCH DISTANT TOWARDS THE EYE FROM THE FOCUS OF THE OBJECT GLASS AS IS THE FOCUS OF THE EYEGLASS THEN THE MIDDLE EYEGLASS IS PLACED SO MUCH DISTANT FROM THE FOCUS OF THE FIRST EYEGLASS AS IS THE FOCUS OF THIS MIDDLE EYEGLASS LASTLY THE NEAREST EYE GLASS IS PLACED SO MUCH DISTANT FROM THE FOCUS OF THIS MIDDLE EYEGLASS AS IS THE FOCUS OF THIS NEAREST EYEGLASS AND THE EYE LOOKING THROUGH THEM ALL IS PLACED IN THE FOCUS OF THIS NEAREST EYEGLASS I SAY THEREFORE FIRST THAT ONE SINGLE CONVEXGLASS CANNOT PROPERLY BE SAID BY IT SELF TO SHEW OBJECTS ERECT OR REVERSE BUT IN RESPECT OF PLACEING OF THE EYE THAT LOOKS THROUGH IT FOR IF THE EYE THAT LOOKS THROUGH SUCH A SINGLE CONVEXGLASS X BE170 BE PLACED NIGHER THERETO THEN THE GLASSES FOCUS THE OBJECTS ARE ERECT IF THE EYE BE PLACED JUST IN THE FOCUS THE OBJECTS ARE NEITHER ERECT NOR REVERSED BUT ALL IN CONFUSION BETWEEN BOTH AND IF THE EYE BE PLACED FURTHER FROM THE GLASS THAN THE FOCUS THE OBJECTS ARE REVERSED I MEAN HERE DISTANT OBJECTS THE RAYS FLOWING FROM ANY POINT WHEREOF MAY BE COUNTED TO COME PARALLEL TOWARDS THE OBJECTGLASS FOR SUCH OBJECTS WE ARE TO CONSIDER WHEN WE SPEAK OF LOOKING THRO TELESCOPES THIS BEING LAID DOWN I ASSERT SECONDLY THAT THE OB JECTGLASS OF A TELESCOPE REVERSES THE OBJECT BOTH TO THE EYE GLASS AND THE EYE THAT LOOKS THROUGH IT FOR THE EYEGLASS IS PLACED FARTHER FROM THE OBJECTGLASS THAN IS THE FOCUS OF THE OBJECTGLASS BUT THE EYEGLASS DOES NOTHING TOWARDS THE REC TIFICATION OR REVERSION THE EYE BEING PLACED JUST IN ITS FOCUS THUS WE SEE THAT THE REVERSING OF OBJECTS IN A TELESCOPE OF TWO CONVEXGLASSES PROCEEDS WHOLY FROM THE OBJECTGLASS AND ITS POSITION AND THE EYEGLASS HAS NOTHING TO DO IN THE AFFAIRE FOR WERE THE EYE IT SELF IN THE PLACE OF THE EYEGLASS IT WOULD SEE THE OBJECTS INVERTED THRO THE SIN GLE OBJECTGLASS I COME NOW TO CONSIDER THE SECOND EYEGLASS PLACED AFTER THE FIRST EYEGLASS THE FIRST EYEGLASS BEING THAT NEXT THE OB JECTGLASS AND HERE IT IS MANIFEST THAT PLACING THIS AS IT OUGHT IN A TELESCOPE IF WE PLACE OUR EYE NEARER TO THIS MID DLE EYEGLASS THAN ITS FOCUS THE EYE SEES THE OBJECTS INVER TED AND CONFUSED PLACE THE EYE IN THE FOCUS IT SEES THE OB JECTS ALL IN CONFUSIONNEITHER ERECT NOR REVERSEDFOR HERE AGAIN THERE IS A DISTINCT REPRESENTATION OF THE OBJECTS TO BE RECEI VED ON A PIECE OF PAPER AS IN THE FOCUS OF THE OBJECTGLASS AND THE EYE BEING PLACED AT ANY TIME AT THIS PLACE WHICH IS USUALLY CALLED THE DISTINCT BASE SEES ALL IN CONFUSION BUT THEN LET THE EYE BE PLACED FARTHER FROM THIS MIDDLE GLASS THEN ITS FOCUSFOR SO IS THE THIRD OR IMMEDIATE EYEGLASSIT BE ING ALWAYES DISTANT FROM THE MIDDLE EYEGLASS THE AGGRE GATE OF BOTH THEIR FOCI IT PERCEIVES THE OBJECTS ERECT AND CONFUSED LAST171 LASTLY THE THIRD OR IMMEDIATE EYEGLASS DOES NOTHING TOWARDS THE ERECTING OR REVERSING THE SPECIES WHICH IT RE CEIVES ERECT FROM THE MIDDLE EYEGLASS NO MORE THAN IN A TELESCOPE OF TWO CONVEXGLASSES THE EYEGLASS DOES TO THE SPECIES IT RECEIVES FROM THE OBJECTGLASS AS WE HAVE SHEWN BEFORE THE REASON THAT THIS LAST OR IMMEDIATE EYEGLASS HAS NOTHING TO DO IN THE ERECTING OR REVERSING THE SPECIES IS THE SAMEAS IN A TELESCOPE OF TWO CONVEXGLASSESVIZ THE EYE IS PLACED IN ITS FOCUS AND THEREFORE SEES THE SPECIES AS TIS REPRESENTED IN THE DISTINCT BASE THAT IS THE SPECIES IS INVERTED IN THE DISTINCT BASE OF THE OBJECTGLASS AND THERE FORE A SINGLE CONVEX EYEGLASS BRINGS IT TO THE EYE INVERTED BUT IN THE DISTINCTBASE OF THE MIDDLE OR SECOND EYEGLASS THE SPECIES IS ERECT AND THEREFORE THE THIRD OR IMMEDI ATE EYEGLASS BRINGS IT TO THE EYE ERECT WHEREFORE WE ARE TO CONSIDER THE TELESCOPE CONSISTING OF AN OBJECTGLASS AND THREE EYEGLASSES AS TWO TELESCOPES EACH CONSISTING OF TWO CONVEXGLASSES THE FIRST CONSISTS OF THE OBJECTGLASS AND FIRST EYEGLASS AND THIS INVERTS THE SPECIES THAT IS THE SPECIES IS INVERTED IN THE DISTINCTBASE OF THE OBJECTGLASS AND SO BROUGHT INTO THE EYE THE SECOND TE LESCOPE CONSISTS OF THE TWO IMMEDIATE EYEGLASSES AND THIS ERECTS WHAT THE FORMER INVERTED THAT IS THE SPECIES IN THE DISTINCTBASE OF THE MIDDLE EYEGLASS IS ERECT AND IS SO BROUGHT INTO THE EYE BY THE EYEGLASS THE EYEGLASSES THEM SELVES IN NEITHER CASE HAVING ANY THING TO DO WITH THE E RECTING OR INVERTING BUT MEERLY IN REPRESENTING IN THE SAME POSTURE THE SPECIES IMMEDIATLY BEFORE THEM THE FRENCH PROBLEM THEREFORE SHOULD NOT HAVE BROKEN A TELESCOPE OF FOUR CONVEXGLASSES INTO FOUR PEICES BUT INTO TWO AND THE CASE WOULD HAVE BEEN PLAIN WHEREAS BY BREAK ING IT INTO FOUR PERSPECTIVEGLASSES THEY ATTRIBUTE THAT TO TWO OF THEM WHICH NEITHER OF THEM DOES VIZ INVERTING AND ERECTING THEREFORE I SAY LASTLY THAT ONE CONVEXGLASS AS POSITED IN A TELESCOPE INVERTS THE SECONDTHAT IS THE FIRST EYEGLASS X 2 DOES172 DOES NOTHING TOWARDS ERECTING OR REVERSING BUT REPRESENTS THE IMAGE AS IT IS IN THE DISTINCTBASE OF THE OBJECTGLASS BE FORE IT THAT IS INVERTED THE THIRD GLASS ERECTS OR RA THER RESTORES WHAT WAS BEFORE INVERTED THE FOURTH REPRE SENTS THE IMAGE AS IT RECEIVES IT FROM THE DISTINCTBASE OF THE THIRD THAT IS ERECT AND THIS I THINK A SUFFICIENT SO LUTION OF THIS PROBLEM

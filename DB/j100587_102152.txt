C D E  1032 A LETTER FROM WILLIAM MOLYNEUX ESQ SEC OF THE DUBLIN SOCIETY TO ONE OF THE S OF THE R S CONCERNING A NEW HYGROSCOPE INVENTED BY HIM DUBLIN APRIL 17 1685 SIR FOR WANT OF SOME THING BETTER TO SEND YOU I SHALL BRIEFLY DECLARE TO YOU THE CONTRIVANCE OF A HYGROS COPE WHICH I HAVE LATELY INVENTED AND PUT IN EXECUTION WITH GOOD SUCCESS I DO NOT KNOW THAT ANY ONE HAS MENTIONED OR SO MUCH AS HINTED AT THE LIKE AND THERE FORE TO ME TIS ALTOGETHER NEW BUT IF ANY ONE HAS BEEN BEFOREHAND WITH ME I SHALL NOT IN THE LEAST CONTEND FOR THE GLORY OF IT FIG 2 AB IS A WHIPCORD ABOUT FOUR FOOT LONG TYED FAST TO THE END OF THE HOOK A AT THE END OF THIS WHIP CORD THERE HANGS THE WEIGHT C ABOUT A POUND OR SOME THING MORE THIS WEIGHT IS SO FITTED AT THE END AS TO RECEIVE AND CARRY THE INDEX D UNDER THESE THERE IS PLACED A GRADUATED CIRCLE ON THE BOARD EF FIXT BY A BRAGGET AGAINST THE WALL ALL THINGS BEING THUS ADAPTED THE MOISTURE OF THE AIR TWISTS THE ROPE AND GIVES A MOTION TO THE INDEX OVER THE DIVISIONS IN THE GRADUATED CIRCLE AND AGAIN AS THE AIR GROWS MORE DRY THE CORD UNTWISTS AND BRINGS BACK THE INDEX BY A CONTRARY MOTION THAT WHICH FIRST GAVE ME THE HINT OF THISWAS THE OBSERV ING ALL ROPES TYED AT BOTH ENDS TO BE MUCH MORE TITE STRETCHED HARDER AFTER RAIN HAS FALLEN ON THEM THEN BEFORE I CONCLUDED THAT IF I COULD AS IT WERE TY A ROPE AT BOTH ENDS AND YET GIVE ONE END A LIBERTY OF CIRCUMVO LUION IT WOULD PERFORM MY DESIRED END NOW THE WEIGHT1033 WEIGHT C HUNG AT THE ROPE DOES THIS FOR IT FIXES AS IT WERE THE END OF THE ROPE B AND YET IT PERMITS IT TO TWIST AND UNTWIST AND THE REASON OF THIS TWISTING AND UNTWISTING IS PLAIN FOR THE LITTLE PARTICLES OF MOISTURE IN SINUATING AND SOAKING INTO THE CORD ARE LIKE SO MANY WEDGES WHICH MUST NEEDS SHORTEN THE ROPE AS A BLAD DER IS SHORTNED BY BEING BLOWN UP AND WILL LIFT A GREAT WEIGHT AS DR WALLIS DISCOURSES AT LARGE IN HIS MECHA NICKS BUT THE EASIEST WAY FOR THE ROPE AB TO SHORTEN AND LIFT UP THE WEIGHT C IS TO DO IT BY WAY OF SCREW FOR IT SELF IS A SCREW THE STRANDS THEREOF BEING TWISTED AND EACH PARTICULAR THREAD IN IT SCREWWISE AND CONSEQUENT LY MUST GIVE A CIRCULAR MOTION TO THE INDEX TO MAKE AN EXPERIMENT OF THIS I WETTED A CORD AND HUNG IT UP WITH THE WEIGHT AT THE END OF IT AND I PER CEIVED AS IT DRYD IT UNTWISTED AND THAT TOO VERY QUICK SO AS TO BE PERCEIVED BY THE EY AFTER THE CORD HAD SO FAR UNTWISTED AS I THOUGHT IT HAD COME TO THAT DEGREE OF DRYNESS THAT THE PRESENT CONSTITUTION OF THE AIR WOULD PERMIT I TOOK A BASON OF WARM WATER THAT SENT OUT A STEAM AND FUME AND PLACED IT UNDER THE CORD IMME DIATLY THE CORD BEGAN AGAIN TO TWIST VERY QUICK AND SO CONTINUED TILL THE WATER CEASED FUMING OR WAS RE MOVED AND THEN IMMEDIATELY IT BEGAN TO RETURN ITS TWISTS I THEN TRYED TO BREATH UPON IT GENTLY WITH MY BREATH AND FOUND ACCORDING TO MY EXPECTATION THAT 8 OR 10 BREATHINGS WOULD TWIST IT 5 DEGREES OF A CIRCLE I THEN PERMITTED IT TO THE AIR ONLY AND FOR THESE LAST THREE WEEKS HAVE OBSERVD ITS MOTION AS AFFECTED BY THE MOIS TURE AND DROUGHT THEREOF AND I FIND IT TO OBEY THE AL TERATIONS THEREOF MOST NICELY THERE FALLS NOT THE LEAST SHOWER AT WHICH IT DOS NOT PRESENTLY TWIST AND WHEN BY RISING CLOUDS A FAIR DAY BECOMES OVERSHADOWD THE CORD IS IMMEDIATELY SENSIBLE THEREOF AND AGAIN AS SENSIBLE OF THEIR VANISHING AND ALTERATION TO FAIR SUNSHINE SO THAT I HAVE SEEN IT SHEW ALTERATION WHEN NOT THE LEAST COULD H H 2 BE1034 BE COLLECTED FROM THE SWEATING OF STONES CRACKING OF WAINSCOTE C SO THAT INDEED I REPUTE IT TO BE THE NICEST HYGROMETER THAT HAS EVER YET BEEN USED AND I AM SURE IS AS CHEAP AND PLAIN AS ANY ONE OF THE GRAND DEFECTS OF MOST INDEED I THINK OF ALL HYGROMETERS HITHERTO INVENTED IS THAT THEY GROW WEAK WITH AGE AND DO NOT SO NICELY OBEY THE ALTERATIONS OF THE AIR WHEN LONG KEPT AS WHEN FIRST MADE PLANKS AND BOARDS GROW MORE SEASONED AND I BELEIVE OATBEARDS WILL PERISH WITH TIME BUT WHETHER OUR PRESENT INVEN TION BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME FAULT I LEAVE TO TIME TO DETER MINE IN THE MEAN WHILE GIVE ME LEAVE TO PROPOSE A REASON WHICH INDUCES ME TO CONJECTURE PROBABLY IT WILL NOT HAVE THIS DEFECT FOR OUR CORD PERFORMS ITS MOTION AS IT IS A PLYABLE SOFT SCREW AND THAT NOT ONLY IN ITS GROS SER PART OR STRANDS BUT EVEN IN ITS SMALLEST THREADS AS LONG AS EVER THIS CONTEXTURE SCREWWISE DOS LAST AND THIS CER TAINLY MUST LAST WHILST TIS A ROPE THE MOTION THAT RE SULTS THEREFROM MUST NECESSARILY LAST FOR THE PARTICLES OF MOISTURE WILL INSINUATE THEMSELVES AND TWIST UP THE SCREW BUT THIS I OFFER ONLY AS A CONJECTURE FOR I LOVE TO CONCLUDE NOTHING IN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY TILL MATTER OF FACT AND EXPERIMENT CONFIRM IT THERE REMAINS ONE THING TO BE OBSERVED OF THIS HYGROS COPE OR WEATHERCLOCK AS AN EASIER NAME TO SATISFY LA DYS THAT ENQUIRE WHAT IT IS AS IT HANGS UP IN A ROOM THAT WHICH I HAVE DESCRIBED I HAVE IN MY CLOSET AND I OBSERVE THAT THE ALTERATIONS OF THE AIR THAT HAVE HAPPEN ED IN THIS TIME HAVE GIVEN IT MORE THEN ONE TURN NOW THIS BEING INCONVENIENT AND THE DUPLICATION OF THE TURN HARD TO BE REGISTRED AS MR HOOK PROPOSES IN HIS MICROGRAPHY PAG 150 CONCERNING THE BEARD OF A WILD OAT I HAVE THOUGHT OF A WAY FOR REMEDYING THIS FOR IT BEING IN OUR POWER TO INCREASE THE DIAMETER OF OUR GRA DUATED CIRCLE AS LARGE AS WE PLEASE WHAT NEED HAVE WE OF MORE THEN ONE TURN FROM THE GREATEST DEGREE OF MOIS TURE1035 TURE TO THE GREATEST DEGREE OF DROUGHT NOW SUPPOSE I FIND THE HYGROSCOPE REPRESENTED IN THE FIGURE TO HAVE TWO COMPLEAT REVOLUTIONS THIS IS TO BE FOUND BY OBSERVATION THROUGHOUT A WHOLE YEAR I SAY THEN THE WAY OF RECTIFY ING IT IS THUS IN FIG2 THE INDEX D HAS TWO COMPLEAT TURNS THE POINT A AS BEING FIXT HAS NO TURN OR MOTION THERE FORE THE MIDDLE POINT G HAS BUT ONE TURN AND CONSE QUENTLY IF I HANG IT UP AT THE POINT G OR NO LONGER THEN G D HALF THE FORMER LENGTH THE INDEX D WILL HAVE BUT ONE TURN WHAT IS HERE SAID OF TWO TURNS AND THE MID DLE POINT G MAY BE ACCOMMODATED TO ANY OTHER NUMBER OF TURNS AND PARTS AND POINTS IN THE ROPE LASTLY SIR WE MAY IN THIS EXPERIMENT PERCEIVE SOME THING THAT MAY HELP US IN THE CONSIDERATION OF THE STRENGTH AND MOTION OF THE MUSCLES OF ANIMALS FOR TAKE A CORD ABLE TO SUSTAIN AN HUNDRED POUND WEIGHT BY THE WEAK FUME OR STEAM OF WARM WATER THIS WEIGHT SHALL BE LIFTED UP FOR IF THIS STEAM TURN THE WEIGHT AS MOST CERTAINLY IT WILL DO IF THE ROPE BE OF ANY MODERATE LENGTH THE WEIGHT IS AS CERTAINLY LIFTED UP THEREBY AS BY A SCREW AS IS EVIDENT TO ANY ONE THAT CONSIDERS IT IF THEREFORE SUCH MIGHTY PERFORMANCES CAN BE PRODUCED BY THE APPLICATION OF SUCH MEAN AGENTS AS WE ALL KNOW AND ARE CONVERSANT WITH WHAT SHALL WE THINK IS TOO GREAT FOR THOSE PARTS WHICH GOD HAS CONTRIVED AND FRAMED IN THE BODYS OF ANIMALS I AM YOUR MOST HUMBLE SERVANT WILLIAM MOLYNEUX P S I FORGOT TO MENTION ONE PARTICULAR THAT IS APPLY A CANDLE OR HEATED IRON NIGH THE ROPE AND IT MAKES IT TWIST VERY QUICK CONTRARY TO MR HOOKS OAT BEARD H H 3 SOME

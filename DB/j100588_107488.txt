J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107488,ON THE LAWS WHICH REGULATE THE ABSORPTION OF POLARISED LIGHT BY DOUBLY REFRACTING CRYSTAL,I206974, 1  II ON THE LAWS WHICH REGULATE THE ABSORPTION OF POLARISED LIGHT BY DOUBLY REFRACTING CRYSTALR BY DAVID BREWSTER LL D F R S LOND AN L EDI L IN A LETTER ADDRESSED TO THE RIGHT HON SIR JOSEPH BANKS BART G C B READ NOVEMBER 12 X188 MY DEAR SIR IN EXAMINING THE POLARISING STRUCTURE OF ACETATE OF COPPER MY ATTENTION WAS DRAWN TO CERTAIN CHANGES OF COLOUR WHICH THIS CRYSTAL EXHIBITED WHEN EXPOSED IN DIFFERENT POSITIONS TO POLARISED LIGHT AS THIS VARIATION OF COLOUR WAS INDEPENDENT OF THE THICKNESS OF THE PLATE AND OF ANY ANALYSIS OF THE TRANSMITTED PENCIL I HAD NO HESITATION IN REGARDING IT AS A NEW AFFECTION OF LIGHT AND IN ASCRIBING THE PHENOMENON TO THE ABSORPTION OF THE HOMOGENEOUS TINTS WHICH FORMED THE COM POUND COLOUR OF THE CRYSTAL I THEREFORE COLLECTED ALL THE NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL CRYSTALS WHICH WERE CHARACTERIZED BY ANY PECULIARITY OF COLOUR AND EXAMINED THE VARIOUS PHENO MENA WHICH THEY PRESENTED WHEN CUT AT DIFFERENT ANGLES WITH THE AXIS AND WHEN EXPOSED IN DIFFERENT POSITIONS TO A POLARISED RAY THE RESULTS WHICH I OBTAINED DURING THIS INVESTIGA TION WERE SINGULAR AND UNEXPECTED AND I AM PERSUADED WILL THROW CONSIDERABLE LIGHT ON THAT PROPERTY OF TRANSPARENT BODIES BY WHICH THEY DETAIN AND ASSIMILATE TO THEIR OWN SUB STANCE A PORTION OF THE RAYS WHICH PENETRATE THEM WHILE THE REST ARE FREELY AND COPIOUSLY TRANSMITTED AS THIS FACULTY OF ABSORBING LIGHT IS RELATED TO THE AXES OF DOUBLE REFRACTION I12 DR BREWSTER O THE ABSORPTION OF POLARISED IGHHT SHALL FIRST DESCRIBE THE PHENOMENA WHICH ARE PRESENTED BY CRYSTALS WITH ONE AXIS AND THEN EXPLAIN THE MODIFICATIONS WHICH THESE PHENOMENA UNDERGO WHEN THE NUMBER OF AXES IS INCREASED SECT I ON THE ABSORPTION OF POLARISED LIGHT BY CRYSTALS WITH ONE AXIS OF DOUBLE REFRACTION IF WE FASTEN UPON ONE SIDE OF A RHOMBOID OF COLOURLESS CALCA REOUS SPAR A CIRCULAR APERTURE OF SUCH A MAGNITUDE THAT THE TWO IMAGES OF IT APPEAR DISTINCTLY SEPARATED WHEN VIEWED THROUGH THE SPAR WE SHALL FIND BY EXPOSING IT PERPENDICU LARLY TO COMMON LIGHT THAT THE TWO IMAGES ARE PERFECTLY COLOURLESS AND OF THE SAME INTENSITY IN EVERY POSITION OF THE RHOMBOID HENCE IF Q BE THE QUANTITY OF TRANSMITTED LIGHT WE SHALL HAVE THE ORDINARY IMAGE 0  Q AND THE EXTRA ORDINARY IMAGE E   Q WHEN THE RHOMBOID IS EXPOSED TO POLARISED LIGHT THE IN TENSITIES OF THE IMAGES VARY WITH THE AZIMUTHAL ANGLE A WHICH THE AXIS OF THE RHOMBOID FORMS WITH THE PLANE OF PRI MITIVE POLARISATION AND MAY BE REPRESENTED BY THE FORMULAE O  Q COS2 A EQSIN2 A BUT SINCEQCOS A  QSIN A  Q WE HAVE O  E Q THAT IS THE SUM OF THE INTENSITIES OF THE TWO PENCILS IS IN EVERY POSITION EQUAL TO THE WHOLE TRANS MITTED LIGHT AND THEREFORE THE RAYS WHICH LEAVE ANY ONE OF THE IMAGES BY A CHANGE OF AZIMUTH ARE NEITHER REFLECTED NOR ABSORBED BUT PASS OVER INTO THE OTHER IMAGE THE OR DINARY PHENOMENA OF DOUBLE REFRACTION CONSEQUENTLY AFFORD US NO REASON FOR CONJECTURING THAT THE CRYSTALS WHICH POSSESS THIS PROPERTY ABSORB THE INCIDENT LIGHT IN ANY OTHER WAY THAN IS DONE BY ALL OTHER BODIES WHETHER SOLID OR FLUIDBY DOUBLY REFRACTING CRYSTALS IF WE NOW TAKE A RHOMBOID OF CERTAIN SPECIMENS OF YELLOW CALCAREOUS SPAR AND PERFORM WITH IT THE EXPERIMENTS WHICH HAVE JUST BEEN DESCRIBED WE SHALL OBTAIN A SERIES OF EN TIRELY DIFFERENT RESULTS THE TWO IMAGES WILL NOW BE FOUND TO DIFFER BOTH IN COLOUR AND INTENSITY THE EXTRAORDINARY IMAGE HAVING AN ORANGE YELLOW HUE WHILE THE COLOUR OF THE ORDINARY IMAGE IS A YELLOWISH WHITE THIS DIFFERENCE OF COLOUR IS DISTINCTLY RELATED TO THE AXIS OF THE CRYSTAL AND INCREASES WITH THE INCLINATION OF THE REFRACTED RAY TO THE SHORT DIAGONAL OF THE RHOMB IT IS A MAXIMUM IN THE EQUATOR WHILE ALONG THE AXIS THE TWO IMAGES HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME COLOUR AND INTENSITY IN EVERY POSITION HOWEVER THE COMBINED TINTS OF THE TWO IMAGES ARE EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE NATURAL TINT OF THE MINERAL IN COMPARING THE INTEN SITIES OF THE TWO IMAGES THE EXTRAORDINARY ONE APPEARS ALWAYS THE FAINTEST SO THAT THERE IS AN INTERCHANGE OF RAYS AND WHILE THE EXTRAORDINARY FORCE CARRIES OFF SEVERAL OF THE YELLOW RAYS FROM THE ORDINARY IMAGE 0 THE ORDINARY FORCE AT THE SAME TIME TAKES TO ITSELF SEVERAL OF THE WHITE RAYS FROM THE EXTRAORDINARY IMAGE E FOR IF THIS WERE NOT THE CASE THE EXTRAORDINARY IMAGE WOULD ALWAYS HAVE THE GREATEST INTENSITY WHEREAS IN CONSEQUENCE OF ITS EXCHANGING YELLOW FOR WHITE LIGHT IT BECOMES ACTUALLY FAINTER THAN THE ORDINARY IMAGE IF WE CALL NZ AND N THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF RAYS WHICH THE EXTRAORDINARY AND THE ORDINARY IMAGE INTERCHANGE AND P THE INCLINATION OF THE REFRACTED RAY TO THE AXIS THE INTENSI TIES MAY BE REPRESENTED BY THE FOLLOWING FORMULAE WHEN THE CRYSTAL IS EXPOSED TO COMMON LIGHT 0  Q  SIN2 Q NT  SIN2 P N AND E  Q  SIN2 P N  SIN2 M THE VALUES OF M AND N VARY IN DIFFERENT CRYSTALS  THEY ARE ALWAYS OF DIFFERENT 1314 DR BREWSTER ON THE ABSORPTION OF POLARISED LIGHT COLOURS AND IN SOME CASES THEY ARE EQUAL TO NEARLY ONE HALF OF THE TRANSMITTED LIGHT WHEN THE RHOMBOID IS EXPOSED TO POLARISED LIGHT A SERIES OF STILL MORE INTERESTING PHENOMENA IS EXHIBITED IN THE POSITION WHERE O VANISHES E IS AN ORANGE YELLOW EXACTLY THE SAME AS IT APPEARED BY COMMON LIGHT AND IN THE POSITION WHERE E VANISHES 0 IS A YELLOWISH WHITE AS BEFORE NOW IT IS OBVIOUS THAT IN THE FIRST OF THESE POSITIONS THE IMAGE E WAS NOT STRENGTHENED BY THE WHITE LIGHT OF THE VANISHED IMAGE 0 OTHERWISE THE IMAGE E WOULD HAVE HAD THE SAME COLOUR AS O  E OR THE NATURAL TINT OF THLE SPAR AND THAT IN THE SECOND POSITION THE IMAGE 0 HAD NOT RECEIVED THE WHOLE OF THE VANISHED IMAGE E OTHERWISE IT WOULD HAVE HAD THE TINT EXPRESSED BY O  E IT THEREFORE NECESSARILY FOLLOWS THAT A PORTION OF THE PENCIL O HAS BEEN ABSORBED IN THE FIRST POSITION AND A PORTION OF THE PENCIL E IN THE SECOND THE QUANTITY OF LIGHT ABSORBED IS A MAXIMUM IN THE TWO POSITIONS WHERE A IS O AND 90G AND IS EQUAL TO THE QUANTITIES M AND N WHICH THE TWO IMAGES INTERCHANGE AT DIFFERENT ANGLES WITH THE AXIS THEREFORE IT IS MEASURED BY SIN2 P M SIN2 QP N WHEN

PROPERTY WHICH THESE CRYSTALS POSSESS OF ABSORBING THE DIFFERENT TINTS IN DIFFERENT POSITIONS OF THE AXIS WITH REGARD TO THE PLANE OF PRIMITIVE POLARISATION DOES NOT BELONG TO EVERY SPECIMEN THERE ARE MANY CRYSTALS OF RUBY SAPPHIRE EME RALD C WHICH GIVE AN ORDINARY AND AN EXTRAORDINARY IMAGE OF THE SAME COLOUR AND WHENEVER THIS IS THE CASE THEY ARE DESTITUTE OF THE PROPERTY OF ABSORBING POLARISED LIGHT THESE TWO CLASSES OF PHENOMENA ARE INDEED INVARIABLY CONNECTED AND WILL ULTIMATELY BE FOUND TO HAVE THE SAME ORIGIN THE EXTREME GENERALITY OF THIS PROPERTY IS INDICATED BY THE NUMBER OF CRYSTALS IN THE PRECEDING TABLE WHICH EMBRACES ALL THE COLOURED CRYSTALS WHICH ARE AT PRESENT KNOWN TO HAVE ONLY ONE AXIS OF DOUBLE REFRACTION EXCEPTING TITANITE MOLYBDATE OF LEAD CARBONATE OF IRON AND LIME ARSENIATE OF COPPER CERTAIN SPE CIMENS OF SULPHATE OF NICKEL AND SUPERACETATE OF COPPER AND LIME IN WHICH I HAVE NOT DETECTED THE PROPERTY OF ABSORBING POLARISED LIGHT THE VARIOUS COLOURED MINERALS WHICH HAVE THE CUBE THE REGULAR OCTOHEDRON AND THE RHOMBOIDAL DODECAHEDRON FOR THEIR PRIMITIVE FORMT ARE AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED DESTITUTE OF THE PROPERTY OF ABSORPTION AND I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DISCOVER IT IN DIFFERENTLY COLOURED GLASSES THAT HAVE RECEIVED THE POLARISING STRUCTURE FROM RAPID COOLING OR FROM MECHANICAL COMPRESSION OR DILATATION SOME OF THE PRECEDING CRYSTALS SUCH AS THE SAPPHIRE AND THE IDOCRASE EXHIBIT DIFFERENT COLOURS WHEN COMMON LIGHT IS TRANS MITTED IN DIRECTIONS PARALLEL AND PERPENDICULAR TO THEIR AXIS OF DOUBLE REFRACTION A SPECIMEN OF SAPPHIRE HAD A DEEP BLUE COLOUR IN ONE DIRECTION AND A YELLOWISH GREEN IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND SEVERAL SPECIMENS OF IDOCRASE HAD AN  SEE THE PHIL TRANS FOR 1818 P Z 2 T ID P 254ORANGE YELLOW TINT ALONG THEIR AXIS AND A YELLOWISH GREEN TINT IN A DIRECTION PERPENDICULAR TO THEIR AXIS THE EXHIBITION OF TWO COLOURS IN THE SAME MINERAL BY COMMON LIGHT WAS FIRST SEEN IN LOLITE AND THE ABBE HAIIY HAD THE BOLDNESS TO GIVE IT THE NAME OF DICHROITE FROM THIS PROPERTY ON THE PRESUMPTION THAT NATURE HAD LIMITED IT TO THIS MINERAL THIS DICHROISMN AS IT MAY BE CALLED WHICH SO FAR AS I KNOW HAS NEVER BEEN OBSERVED IN ANY OTHER MINERALS THAN IOLITE AND MICA IS A VERY COMMON PROPERTY OF CRYSTALLIZED BODIES AS WILL BE SEEN FROM THE FOLLOWING SECTION SECT II ON THE ABSORPTION OF POLARISED LIGHT BY CRYSTALS WITH TWO AXES OF DOUBLE REFRACTION THE GENERAL PHENOMENA OF ABSORPTION IN CRYSTALS WITH TWO AXES ARE NEARLY THE SAME AS THOSE WHICH HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED IN THE PRECEDING SECTION BUT THE QUANTITY OF LIGHT WHICH THE ORDINARY AND EXTRAORDINARY FORCES INTERCHANGE IS REGULATED BY NEW LAWS DEPENDING ON THE SITUATION OF THE INCIDENT RAY WITH RESPECT TO THE TWO AXES OF DOUBLE REFRACTION IF OO AND AB A LINE PERPENDICULAR TO IT ARE THE TWO AXES AND PP THE RESULTANT AXES OR THE POLES OF NOPOLARISATION OF BLUE TOPAZ THEN IF COD THE A PLANE OF THE RESULTANT AXES IS PER PENDICULAR TO THE PLANE OF PRIMITIVE POLARISATION THE POLARISED LIGHT IN I  CIDENT ON THE PLATE AT 0 WILL BE BLUE C AFTER TRANSMISSION TIHE BLUE TINT PRESERVES ITS INTENSITY FROM 0 TO A AND B THE THICKNESS OF THE PLATE B BEING SUPPOSED

THE LIGHT BECOMING MORE AND MORE WHITE WITH A SLIGHT TINGE OF RED TILL IT REACHES C AND D WHERE IT HAS THE SAME COLOUR AS THAT OF THE TOPAZ IN COMMON LIGHT AS THE PLATE OF TOPAZ IS TURNED ROUND THE POLARISED RAY THE BLUE TINT CHANGES INTO WHITE ACCORDING TO THE LAW GIVEN IN THE PRECEDING SECTION EXCEPTING IN THE LINE CD WHERE THE TINT IS INVARIABLY WHITE IN EVERY AZIMUTH WHEN THE POLARISED LIGHT IS TRANSMITTED ALONG ANY OF THE RESULTANT AXES P P THE TWO TINTS DIVERGE FROM THE POLES IN THE FORM OF A CROSS AS SHOWN IN THE PRE CEDING FIGURE THE EFFECT AT 0 OR THE INTERCHANGE OF THE BLUE AND WHITE LIGHT BETWEEN THE ORDINARY AND EXTRAORDINARY RAYS IS RELATED TO THE AXIS AB ALONE AND IN LIKE MLANNER THE EFFECT AT A IS RELATED SOLELY TO THE OTHER AXIS 0 BUT THOUGH THE AXIS OO IS MORE POWERFUL IN TOPAZ THAN AB YET THE VALUES OF M AND N FOR EACH AXIS DO NOT APPEAR TO BE DIFFERENT A RESULT WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED FROM THE FACT THAT THESE TINTS IN DIFFERENT CRYSTALS HAVE NO RELATION TO THE INTENSITY OF THEIR POLARISING FORCES THE DIMINUTION OF THE TINTS M AND N IN PASSING FROM 0 TO C AND D IS OWING TO THE ACTION OF THE OTHER AXIS 0 AT THE POINTS C AND D BLUE LIGHT ALONE WILL BE TRANSMITTED WHEN AB CONSIDERED AS A SEPARATE AXIS IS PER PENDICULAR TO THE PLANE OF PRIMITIVE POLARISATION AND AT THE SAME POINT WHITE LIGHT ALONE WILL BE TRANSMITTED WHEN O CON SIDERED AS A

CRYSTALS SECT III ON THE INFLUENCE OF HEAT IN MODIFYING THE ABSORBENT POWER OF CRYSTALS HAVING SELECTED SEVERAL CRYSTALS OF BRAZILIAN TOPAZ WHICH DISPLAYED NO CHANGE OF COLOUR BY EXPOSURE TO POLARISED LIGHT I FOUND THAT AFTER BRINGING THEM TO A RED HEAT OR EVEN BOIL ING THEM IN OLIVE OIL OR IN MERCURY THEY EXPERIENCED SUCH A CHANGE IN THEIR STRUCTURE AS TO EXHIBIT DISTINCTLY THE POWER OF ABSORBING POLARISED LIGHT I NEXT TOOK A TOPAZ WHICH HAD ONE OF ITS TWO PENCILS YELLOW AND THE OTHER PINK BY EX POSING IT TO A RED HEAT THE HEAT ACTED MORE POWERFULLY UPON THE EXTRAORDINARY THAN UPON THE ORDINARY PENCIL DISCHARGING THE YELLOW COLOUR ENTIRELY FROM THE ONE AND PRODUCING BUT A SLIGHT CHANGE UPON THE PINK COLOUR OF THE OTHER IN THE FORMATION OF PINK TOPAZES BY HEAT IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN SUPPOSED THAT THE YELLOW COLOUR IS ACTUALLY CHANGED INTO PINK BUT THIS IS QUITE A MISTAKE FOR THE PINK COLOUR MUST PREVIOUSLY EXIST IN A STATE OF COMBINATION WITH THE YEL LOW AND MUST EITHER FORM THE COLOUR OR EXIST IN THE COLOUR OF ONE OF THE PENCILS PRODUCED BY DOUBLE REFRACTION THE HEAT DOES NO MORE THAN DISCHARGE ONE COLOUR AND LEAVE THE OTHER ALMOST UNIMPAIRED THIS RESULT IS OF CONSIDERABLE PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE TO THE JEWELLER AS IT ENABLES HIM TO DETERMINE BEFORE HAND WHETHER OR NOT ANY TOPAZ WILL RECEIVE A PINK COLOUR FROM HEAT FOR IF THIS COLOUR EXISTS IN ONE OF ITS IMAGES WHICH WILL IN GENERAL BE SEEN BY EXPOSING IT TO A POLARISED RAY HE MAY PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE SUCCESS OF HIS EXPERIMENT WHEN A TOPAZ POSSESSING A PINK TINT HAS BEEN TAKEN MDCCCXIX E 25O2G DR BREWSTER ON THE ABSORPTION OF POLARISED LIGHT FROM THE FIRE IT IS AT FIRST PERFECTLY COLOURLESS AND ACQUIRES THE PINK COLOUR GRADUALLY IN THE ACT OF COOLING BY EX POSING IT REPEATEDLY TO THE ACTION OF A VERY INTENSE HEAT I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE EITHER TO REMOVE OR TO MODIFY THIS PER MANENT TINT WITH THE VIEW OF ASCERTAINING IF THE ABSORBING STRUCTURE COULD BE INDUCED BY HEAT I EXPOSED TO A WHITE HEAT SEVERAL CRYSTALS OF YELLOWISH CALCAREOUS SPAR AFTER THE ACTION OF THE FIRE HAD BEEN CONTINUED FOR SOME TIME A SORT OF OPALES CENCE OR MILKY OPACITY WAS INDUCED AND THE LIGHT WHICH WENT TO THE FORMATION OF THE ORDINARY IMAGE WAS MUCH REDDER THAN THAT WHICH FORMED THE EXTRAORDINARY RAY THIS EFFECT I NATURALLY ASCRIBED TO SOME CHANGE IN THE STATE OF THE CARBONIC ACID AND UPON CONTINUING THE ACTION OF THE HEAT AND WATCHING THE PROCESS OF DECOMPOSITION I FOUND THAT WHEN THE CARBONIC ACID WAS EXPELLED FROM A FILM ABOUT THE 200OOTH PART OF AN INCH THICK ITS SURFACE WAS COVERED WITH VESICLES ARRANGED IN STRAIGHT LINES PARALLEL TO THF SHORT DIAGONAL OF THE RHOMBOID THESE VESICLES HAD IN GENERAL AN ELLIP TICAL FORM WITH A CUT OR OPENING IN THE DIRECTION OF THEIR TRANSVERSE AXIS THROUGH WHICH THE GAS HAD ESCAPED AFTER THE SPAR WAS TAKEN FROM THE FIRE A GREAT NUMBER OF THE VESICLES BURST WITH A NOISE SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH ACCOMPANIES THE BURSTING OF THE INDUSIUM OF THE FERN AND CARRIED OFF A PORTION OF THE THIN CALCAREOUS PELLICLE WHEN THIS PELLICLE WAS REMOVED THE SUBJACENT SURFACE WAS COVERED WITH A SERIES OF MINUTE PARALLEL GROOVES INCLINED ABOUT 20O 57 TO THE SHORT DIAGONAL IN REPEATING THIS EXPERIMENT AND SEIZING THE PROPER TIME FOR WITHDRAWING THE SPAR FROM THE FIRE IBY DOUBLY REFRACTING CRYSTALS 27 HAVE NEVER FAILED TO OBSERVE THE FACT OF THE ARRANGEMENT AND BURSTING OF THE VESICLES AND I HAVE NO HESITATION IN CON CLUDING THAT THE CARBONIC ACID IS ARRANGED IN PLANES PASSING THROUGH THE AXIS OF THE CRYSTAL A RESULT WHICH I HAD FOR MERLY ASSUMED IN EXPLAINING THE PHENOMENA OF DOUBLE RE FRACTION THIS METHOD OF STUDYING THE STRUCTURE OF BODIES BY WATCHING THEM IN THE PROCESS OF DISINTEGRATION MAY BE FOUND TO HAVE A VERY EXTENSIVE APPLICATION IN CHEMICAL AND MINE RALOGICAL ENQUIRIES THE OBSERVATIONS CONTAINED IN THE PRECEDING PAGES INDICATE IN A MANNER BY NO MEANS EQUIVOCAL THAT THE COLOURING PAR TICLES OF CRYSTALS INSTEAD OF BEING INDISCRIMINATELY DISPERSED THROUGHOUT THEIR MASS HAVE AN ARRANGEMENT RELATED TO THE ORDINARY AND EXTRAORDINARY FORCES WHICH THEY EXERT UPON LIGHT IN SOME SPECIMENS THE EXTRAORDINARY MEDIUM IS TINGED WITH THE SAME COLOURING PARTICLES AND WITH THE SAME NUMBER OF THEM AS THE ORDINARY MEDIUM  BUT IN OTHER SPECIMENS OF THE SAME MINERAL THE EXTRAORDINARY MEDIUM IS EITHER TINGED WITH A DIFFERENT NUMBER OF PARTICLES OF THE SAME COLOUR OR WITH A COLOURING MATTER ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE ORDINARY MEDIUM IN CERTAIN SPECIMENS OF TOPAZ THECOLOURING MATTER OF THE ONE MEDIUM IS MORE EASILY DISCHARGED THAN THAT OF THE OTHER AND IN TWO SPECIMENS OF EMERALD THE COLOURING MATTER WHICH TINGES THE ORDINARY MEDIUM IN THE ONE TINGES THE EX TRAORDINARY MEDIUM IN THE OTHER AND VICE VERSA ALL THOSE CRYSTALS IN WHICH THE COLOURING MATTER OF THE ONE MEDIUM DIFFERS EITHER IN CHARACTER OR INTENSITY POSSESS THE PROPERTY OF ABSORBING THE TWO TINTS ACCORDING TO THE LAWS8 DR BREWSTER ON THE ABSORPTION OF POLARISED LIGHT C ALREADY MENTIONED BUT THERE IS ALSO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT POLARISED LIGHT SUFFERS THE SAME KIND OF ABSORPTION IN THOSE CRYSTALS WHOSE TWO IMAGES HAVE THE SAME TINT AND EVEN IN THOSE WHICH ARE

dots seen under certain hieroglyphs as rendering the sound ho five will receive a curious illustra tion by the varied form these dots exhibit for instance in the Fig 35b taken from the Dresden Codex It does not appear with all that the samples of interpretation presented by Professor Thomas in his last paper are more satisfactory than those of his former one It will be seen indeed that there is no reliance in the simple fact that applying a certain key the parts give ap parently appropriate results In a similar way there could be proved and has been proved that the Mexican and Peruvian lan guages are derived from Sanscrit and that the descendants of the lost tribes of Israel survive in the Southern Sea The right Professor Thomas claims to apply such a key has to be proved in the first place I am awaiting if in the paper he is preparing for publication by the Bureau of Ethnology he will be able to do so  DR SELER Steglltz Germany Dec 18 Irrigation Surveys I HAVE just had the pleasure of perusing your issue of the 16th with its review of Irrigation Work by the General Govern ment Allow me in returning my thanks for the comprehensive references made to make some brief corrections In the first place then the expenditures of the Geological Sur vey as to irrigation work have been that of two appropria tions  in all 350000 This is wholly outside of printingwhich is paid for under other appropriations The cost thereof will not be less than 15000 Besides these two direct sums of 100000 and 250000 with the printing of Part II in Annual Reports 10 and 11 the Survey for work in the Arid Region topo graphic and hydrographic has had two more annual appropria tions of not less than 100 000 in all The terms of the appropria tions were designed unquestionably to continue indirectly irriga tion work which Congress had declared should not be continued by the Geological Survey Its irrigation work then has cost much nearer 500000 than it has 235000 Its results are two finely printed volumes one of 123 pages and the other of 395 In the latter are 80 or 90 pages of matter previously printed the larger part of it indeed having been twice printed by com mittees of the Senate and House The reprint in Report Eleven is of Major Powells testimony and argument before the House Select Committee on Irrigation 51st Congress which in substance and effect is the same that Director Powell made to the Senate Committee at the same session So in effect it has cost nearly half a million dollars to publish 419 pages of  original  reports There are no topographical maps of significance as yet issued Now the Department of Agriculture under its office of Artesian and Underflov Investigation and of Irrigation Inquiry received and expended between April 15 1890 and May 1 1892 just two years the munificent sum of 70000 During that time it made and has reported on two engineering geological and economic examinations of the Great Plains region between 97 and 105 of longitude and two reports besides on Irrigation proper It pre pared and issued six volumes in all  a report on Artesian Wells and the three parts you have noticed of the closing report on Ar tesian and Underflow Waters also Progress Irrigation Report for 1891 and the volume referred to as miscellaneous by the re VOL XXI No 518 view As the work is in part only my own though I edited all of it I can justly challenge the value of it all in quality as much as I may claim it exceeds the report in quantity as compared with the Geological Survey The three reports six volumes or parts embrace in all 1694 pages and some 58 valuable profiles maps and geologic sections besides more than 100 other special illustrations The report four parts you reviewed has been printed to the number of but 1733 copies for the use of Congress and it has cost something less than 4000 The other reports cost in all about 2500  a total estimate of 6500 Since that publication Congress has appropriated 6000 more for Irrigation Inquiry How much of this has been used I do not know some of it I am aware has been wasted and I make the remark advis edly as much as I regret to say anything except in approval of the Department of Agriculture The account stands then A Ten thousand copies 5000 each volume under a general provision of law of two reports and some other reprinting by the U S Geological Survey with a number of reservoir sites re served on the public lands most of which have been restored under later law by the Land Office to the Public Domain the cost of all at least 465000 B Eight reports in all by the Office of Irrigation Inquiry De partmant of Agriculture three of the Engineers three of the Geologists and the same number of the Agent in charge my self in all seven parts or volumes containing the matter in brief already stated all this too in cost has been less than 80000 The Weather Service volume chiefly Mr Glassfords work is above criticism and that of the U S Census Office in its  Irri gation Division  work is only an adjunct to the U S Geological Survey unduly fostered by the Secretary of the Interior and the Superintendent of the Census to enable Director Powell to do that which the 51st Congress by withdrawal of a specific appro priation had forbidden him doing viz continue the work of irrigation survey and inquiry The agent in charge was formerly an hydrographer in the Survey and was transferred to the Cen sus He has done better than it could have been anticipated he would from his first bulletins but the work has cost far more than it is worth That too from the value of the conditions and not the ability of the agent himself Of course it will be noticed most because it has the benefit of the expensive printing and publishing of the Census Office This whole irrigation inquiry has been characterized by a wasteful scramble to get in or on it The State Department has published a volume thereon the Treasurys Bureau of Statistics has dabbled therein in its volumes on Internal Commerce the General Land Office has had its shy the Weather Service is discussing  Earth Moisture etc and the Army Engineer Of fice got in a little one on Egypt The Department of Agricul ture only did what it was ordered and of late months not all of that RICHARD J HINTON Member Am So of Irrigation Engrs Washington Dec 26 Geographical Variation in Birds In ornithology geography is the father of trinomial nomen clature Climate is one great factor in variation and topography has not a little to do with making the climate but geography is unquestionably the cause of variable climate else would the polar regions be tropical instead of frigid Topography is at best local The variations of a species of birds which make of it several subspecies are due to its geographical distribution These vary ing individuals do not take the name of forms as in entomol ogy but are set apart as true sub species each with a more or less well defined habitat of its own But there is a serious diffi culty in ascribing any sharp line of difference between the forms which intergrade on the outskirts of the geographical range and a corresponding difficulty in ascribing any definite geographical limit It is not seldom that individuals of one subspecies are found far within the range of another subspecies

J100688,ABSTRACTS OF THE PAPERS PRINTED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,109605,A DESCRIPTION OF MALFORMATION IN THE HEART OF AN INFANT ABSTRACT,I207043,195 SELDOM HAVING A PASSAGE OFTENER THAN ONCE IN NINE DAYS SOMETIMES ONLY ONCE IN FOURTEEN DAYS SHE CEASED TO GROW AT TEN YEARS OF AGE AND WAS ONLY FOUR FEET SIX INCHES IN HEIGHT ACROSS THE SHOULDERS SHE MEASURED FOURTEEN INCHES BUT HER PELVIS MEASURED ONLY NINE INCHES FROM THE OSSA ILIA TO THE SACRUM HER BREASTS AND NIPPLES NEVER ENLARGED MORE THAN THOSE OF A MAN NOR DID SHE EVER MEN STRUATE OR SHOW ANY OTHER SIGN OF PUBERTY EITHER IN MIND OR BODY ON THE CONTRARY SHE ALWAYS EXPRESSED AVERSION TO THE FAMILIARITIES OF YOUNG MEN AT THE AGE OF TWENTYONE SHE BECAME UNEASY AT FINDING HERSELF DIFFERENT FROM OTHER WOMEN AND ATTRIBUTING THE DIFFERENCE TO HER NOT HAVING MENSTRUATED FREQUENTLY APPLIED FOR MEDICAL ADVICE SHE WAS FROM HER INFANCY SUBJECT TO THE ATTACKS OF A COMPLAINT IN THE CHEST ATTENDED WITH COUGH THESE ATTACKS INCREASED IN VIO LENCE AS SHE ADVANCED IN AGE AND IN HER TWENTYNINTH YEAR ONE OF THEM CAME ON ATTENDED WITH CONVULSIONS OF WHICH AFTER A FEW HOURS SHE DIED UPON EXAMINING THE FEMALE ORGANS AFTER HER DEATH IT APPEARED THAT THE OS TINCWE AND UTERUS HAD THE USUAL FORM BUT HAD NOT INCREASED BEYOND THEIR SIZE IN THE INFANT STATE THE PASSAGE INTO THE UTERUS THROUGH THE CERVIX WAS OBLIQUE AND THE FALLOPIAN TUBES WERE PER VIOUS TO THE FIMBRIE THE OVARIA WERE SO INDISTINCT THAT THEY RATHER SHOWED THE RUDIMENTS WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE FORMED THEM THAN ANY PART OF THEIR NATURAL STRUCTURE FROM THE HISTORY OF THE PRECEDING CASE IT APPEARS NOT ONLY THAT AN IMPERFECT STATE OF THE OVARIA IS ATTENDED WITH AN ABSENCE OF ALL THE CHARACTERS BELONGING TO THE FEMALE AFTER PUBERTY BUT ALSO THAT THE UTERUS ITSELF ALTHOUGH PERFECTLY FORMED WAS CHECKED IN ITS GROWTH IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE IMPERFECT STRUCTURE OF THOSE PARTS A DESCRIPTION OF MALFORMATION IN THE HEART OF AN INFANT BY MR HUGH CHUDLEIGH STANDERT COMMUNICATED BY ANTHONY CARLISLE ESQ FRS READ MAY 9 1805 PHIL TRANS 1805 P 228 THE INFANT HERE TREATED OF DIED AT THE AGE OF TEN DAYS DURING WHICH PERIOD NOTHING PARTICULAR WAS REMARKED EXCEPT THAT THE SKIN EXHI BITED THE BLUE COLOUR SO COMMON IN CASES OF IMPERFECT PULMONARY CIRCULATION UPON OPENING THE BODY ALL THE VISCERA WERE FOUND IN THE NATURAL STATE EXCEPT THE HEART WHICH EXHIBITED THE FOLLOWING REMARKABLE STRUCTURE EXTERNALLY ONLY ONE AURICLE COULD BE PERCEIVED INTO WHICH THE PULMONARY VEINS AND VENWE CAVAE ENTERED IN THE USUAL MANNER THE PULMONARY ARTERY WAS WANTING AND THE BODY OF THE HEART HAD BUT ONE VENTRICLE WHICH WAS SEPARATED FROM THE AURICLE BY TENDINOUS VALVES AND OPENED INTO THE AORTA THE AURICLE WAS ALSO SINGLE AND HAD A NARROW MUSCULAR BAND WHICH CROSSED THE OSTIUM VENOSUM IN THE PLACE OF THE SEPTUM THE AORTA SENT OFF AN ARTERY FROM THE SITUATION OF THE DUCTUS ARTERIOSUS THIS O 2196 ARTERY WAS DIVIDED INTO TWO BRANCHES TO SUPPLY THE LUNGS THESE VESSELS WERE OF SMALL DIAMETER THE PULMONARY VEINS WERE FOUR IN NUMBER BUT THE AREA OF THESE AND THAT OF THE VESSEL WHICH ACTED AS THE PULMONARY ARTERY DID NOT EXCEED HALF THE USUAL DIMENSIONS THE CHILD WHILE ALIVE WAS SEEN BY DR CONMBE WHO DID NOT OBSERVE THAT ITS RESPIRATION TEMPERATURE OR MUSCULAR ACTION WERE MATERIALLY AFFECTED ON A METHOD OF ANALYSING STONES CONTAINING FIXED ALKALI BY MEANS OF THE BORACIC ACID BY HUMPHRY DAVY ESQ FRS PROFESSOR OF CHEMISTRY IN THE ROYAL INSTITUTION READ MAY 16 1805 PHIL TRANS 1805P 231 THE METHOD OF ANALYSIS HERE DESCRIBED BY MR DAVY IS FOUNDED ON THE ATTRACTION OF THE BORACIC ACID FOR THE SIMPLE EARTHS WHICH IS CON SIDERABLE AT THE HEAT OF IGNITION AND ON THE EASE WITH WHICH THE COMPOUNDS FORMED WITH THEM ARE DECOMPOSED BY THE MINERAL ACIDS THE PROCESS IS AS FOLLOWS 100 GRAINS OF THE STONE TO BE EXAMINED MUST BE FUSED FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR IN A STRONG RED HEAT WITH 200 GRAINS OF BORACIC ACID AN OUNCE AND A HALF OF NITRIC ACID DILUTED WITH SEVEN OR EIGHT TIMES AS MUCH WATER MUST BE DIGESTED UPON THE MASS TILL THE WHOLE IS DECOMPOSED AND THE FLUID MUST THEN BE RE DUCED BY EVAPORATION TO AN OUNCE AND A HALF OR TWO OUNCES IF THE STONE CONTAIN SILEX IT WILL NOW BE SEPARATED THIS MUST BE COLLECTED UPON A FILTER AND WASHED WITH DISTILLED WATER TILL FREED FROM THE BORACIC ACID AND ALL OTHER SALINE MATTER THE WATER THAT HAS PASSED MUST BE MIXED WITH THE OTHER FLUID AND THE MIXTURE EVAPORATED TILL IT IS REDUCED TO A CONVENIENT QUANTITY FOR INSTANCE HALF A PINT IT MUST THEN BE SATURATED WITH CARBONATE OF AMMONIA AND BOILED WITH AN EXCESS OF THIS SALT TILL ALL PRECIPITABLE MATTER HAS FALLEN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE VESSEL THE EARTHS AND METALLIC OXIDES MUST BE SEPARATED BY THE FILTER AND TO THE FILTERED LIQUOR MUST BE ADDED NITRIC ACID TILL IT TASTES VERY SOUR IT MUST THEN BE EVAPORATED TILL THE BORACIC ACID APPEARS FREE THE FLUID MUST BE AGAIN PASSED THROUGH THE FILTER AND EVAPORATED TO DRYNESS WHEN BY EXPOSURE TO A DEGREE OF HEAT EQUAL TO 450 OF FAHRENHEIT THE NITRATE OF AMMONIA WILL BE DECOMPOSED AND THE NI TRATE OF FIXED ALKALI WILL REMAIN IN THE VESSEL THE REMAINING EARTHS AND OXIDES MR DAVY HAS SEPARATED BY THE USUAL PROCESSES THE ALUMINLA HE HAS SEPARATED BY SOLUTION OF POT ASH THE LIME BY SULPHURIC ACID THE OXIDE OF IRON BY SUCCINATE OF AMMONIA THE MANGANESE BY HYDROSULPHURET OF POTASH AND THE MAGNESIA BY PURE SODA

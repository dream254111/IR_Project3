THE TWO PLANTS HE WAS THEN ASKED DID THE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN YOUR COMPANY AND THE MATHIESON ALKALI WORKS LEAD TO CONTRACT AND IF NOT STATE THE REASON TO WHICH QUESTION THE PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL OBJECTED AS IMMATERIAL AND IRRELEVANT THE WITNESS ANSWERED IT DID NOT LEAD TO CONTRACT THE REASONS WERE THAT THE PLANT AT SALTVILLE WAS SO ANTIQUATED AND OLD FASHIONED THAT HIS COMPANY DECIDED THAT IT WOULD COST MORE TO TEAR IT DOWN AND ERECT ANOTHER IN ITS PLACE THAN IT WOULD COST TO GO TO ANOTHER LOCATION AND ERECT AN ENTIRELY NEW PLANT THE COURT SUSTAINED THE OBJECTION AND EX CLUDED THE QUESTION AND ANSWER WE THINK THERE WAS NO ERROR IN THIS RULING THE WITNESS HAD BEEN PERMITTED TO STATE WITH FULLNESS ALL THQ FACTS AND TO GIVE HIS OPINION AS TO THE INSUFFI CIENCY AND OBSOLETE CHARACTER OF THE PLANT AS CONSTRUCTED BUT A PROPOSED DEAL BETWEEN THE TWO COMPANIES ONE WITH WORKS IN OHIO AND THE OTHER IN VIRGINIA FOR A CONSOLIDATION OF THEIR WORKS OBVIOUSLY INVOLVED MANY ELEMENTS WHICH THE TRIAL JUDGE IN HIS DISCRETION RIGHTLY DECLINED TO PERMIT BEING EXAMINED INTO COLLATERALLY IN THIS TRIAL ANOTHER EXCEPTION AND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR AROSE AS FOLLOWS THE DEFENDANT PRODUCED A WITNESS DRILL AN EXPERT MECHANICAL ENGINEER FAMILIAR WITH THE MANUFACTURE OF CHEMICALS THE DEFENDANT PROPOSED TO ASK HIM THIS QUESTION Q FOLLOWING YOUR EXPERIENCE AND HAVING HEARD THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE DO YOU CONSIDER THAT THE COMPRESSORS DESCRIBED AS HAVING BEEN INSTALLED BY MR MATHIESON AT SALTVILLE IN 1893 WERE SUITABLE FOR THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH THEY WERE INSTALLED AND THE FUR THER QUESTION Q YOU HAVE HEARD THE TESTIMONY AS TO THE GAS COMPRESSORS INSTALLED BY MR MATHIESON IN 1893 WERE THOSE COMPRESSORS SUITABLE FOR THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH THEY WERE IN STALLED  THE OBJECTION TO THESE TWO QUESTIONS WAS SUSTAINED BY THE TRIAL JUDGE UPON THE GROUND THAT THE QUESTION DID NOT WITH PROPER CLEARNESS SET OUT THE SUPPOSED FACTS OR INFORMATION OR HYPOTHESIS UPON WHICH THE EXPERT WAS ASKED TO GIVE HIS OPINION SO THAT IT COULD NOT BE KNOWN IN WHAT CONSTITUTED THE UNSUITA BLENESS OF THE COMPRESSOR WHICH THE WITNESS HAD IN HIS MIND IT BEING CONCEDED THAT COMPRESSORS ARE BUILT IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT FORMS BUT EVEN IFTHIS RULING WAS OPEN TO EXCEPTION NO HARM 69912 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER WAS DONE THE DEFENDANT FOR THE WITNESS PROCEEDED TO TESTIFY SPECIFICALLY WITH REGARD TO THE SALTVILLE COMPRESSORS AND TO STATE THE OBJECTIONS HE ENTERTAINED TO THEM AS TO MATERIAL AND DESIGN AND WHY THEY WERE IN HIS OPINION NOT EFFICIENT AND NOT SUITABLE AND HAD BEEN SUPERSEDED IN WELL DESIGNED PLANTS SO THAT THE DEFENDANT HAD THE BENEFIT OF ALL THAT THE WITNESS COULD HAVE SAID IN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION ANOTHER EXCEPTION AND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR WAS THE REFUSAL OF THE COURT TO ALLOW DEFENDANTS COUNSEL TO ASK AN EXPERT WIT NESS STROEBEL THE FOLLOWING QUESTION Q DID YOU OR NOT IN ENGLAND IN 1885 SEE IN USE BETTER COMPRESSOR ENGINES THAN THOSE INSTALLED BY MR MATHIESON AT SALTVILLE THE PLAINTIFFS OB JECTION TO THIS QUESTION WAS SUSTAINED THE COURT GIVING THE FOLLOWING REASON BECAUSE THE WITNESS IS ASKED FOR A COMPARISON WITH SOMETHING WITHIN HIS OWN MIND KNOWLEDGE AND OBSERVA TION AFFORDING THE PLAINTIFF NO OPPORTUNITY OR MEANS OF CON TROVERTING ANYTHING WHATSOEVER THAT THE WITNESS MIGHT SAY WE ARE SATISFIED THERE WAS NO ERROR IN THIS RULING THE QUES TION WAS TOO GENERAL ANOTHER EXCEPTION AND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR AROSE AS FOLLOWS THE WITNESS STROEBEL A MECHANICAL ENGINEER HAVING TESTIFIED THAT THE GAS COMPRESSORS INSTALLED BY THE PLAINTIFF WHICH WERE OF ENGLISH MAKE WERE NOT EQUAL IN EFFICIENCY AND ECONOMY TO THOSE OF AMERICAN MANUFACTURE OF THE SAME DATE WAS ASKED AT WHAT PRICE COULD GAS COMPRESSORS OF THE CAPACITY OF THOSE INSTALLED BY MR MATHIESON AND EQUAL IN EFFICIENCY AND ECONOMY AND EQUALLY WELL ADAPTED FOR THE PURPOSE THEN IN VIEW HAVE BEEN BOUGHT FROM AMERICAN MAKERS IN THE YEAR 1892 AND 1893 AND THE WITNESS ANSWERED AT ABOUT NINE THOUSAND DOL LARS FOR EACH COMPRESSOR MR ARNOLD THE PRESIDENT OF THE DEFENDANT CORPORATION AND WHO WAS ITS EXECUTIVE HEAD IN ALL DEALINGS WITH THE PLAINTIFF HAD TESTIFIED THAT HE DID BEFORE THE COMPRESSORS WERE ORDERED IN ENGLAND ASK MANUFACTURERS IN AMERICA TO GIVE ESTIMATES FOR THE GAS COMPRESSORS AND IN A LETTER WRITTEN BY HIM TO THE PLAINTIFF JANUARY 29TH 1892 HE QUOTES FROM A LETTER OF AN AMERICAN ENGINE BUILDER AN ESTI MATE THAT THE COST OF TWELVE VERTICAL COMPRESSORS F O B AT THE ELGINE WORKS WOULD BE 260000 IN A LETTER TO THE PLAINTIFFS FATHER APRIL 28TH 1891 MR ARNOLD WROTE I THINK AND IT IS THE GENERAL OPINION OF THOSE JOINING US IN THE ENTERPRISE THAT IT MAY BE WELL TO BUILD ONE SET OF ENGINES ON YOUR SIDE AS VOU SUG GEST THE TRIAL JUDGE EXCLUDED THE QUESTION AND ANSWER OF THE WITNESS STROBEL WITH REGARD TO THE COST OF COMPRESSOR EN GINES PROCURABLE IN THE UNITED STATES FOR THE REASON THAT IT LID NOT SEEM JUST THAT THE PLAINTIFF WHO WAS A RESIDENT OF ENGLAND AND NOT A MECHANICAL ENGINEER AND WHOSE EXPERIENCE WAS LIM 700 JAN1907 MATHIESON ALKALI WORKS V MATHIESON ITED TO ALKALI PLANTS SHOULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR NOT HAVING KNOWN THE FACT THAT AMERICAN ENGINES COULD BE PURCHASED MORE CHEAPLY THAN ENGLISH ENGINES UNLESS IT WAS SHOWN THAT IF WAS A FACT GENERALLY KNOWN IN ENGLAND AT THE DATE BY PERSONS IN LIKE SITUATION AND EMPLOYMENT WITH THE PLAINTIFF OR WAS DIRECTLY MADE KNOWN TO HIM THERE DOES NOT SEEM TO US TO BE REVERSIBLE ERROR IN THIS RULING THE PLAINTIFF DID NOT HOLD HIMSELF OUT AS IN A GENERAL SENSE A MECHANICAL EXPERT BUT AS HAVING EXPERIENCE IN MANAG ING ALKALI WORKS AND AS KNOWING THE PROPER REQUIREMENTS IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF SUCH WORKS THERE WAS TESTIMONY TENDING TO SHOW THAT IT WAS THE MATHIESON WORKS AT WIDNES ENGLAND WHICH IN ALL THEIR PLANS AND CONTRACTS THE DEFENDANTS PRESIDENT MR ARNOLD AND THE PLAINTIFF HAD IN MIND AS THE TYPE AND GEN ERAL MODEL OF THE WORKS TO BE CONSTRUCTED AT SALTVILLE VIRGINIA AND WERE TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF MR ARNOLD THE WORKS WITH WHICH THE PLAINTIFF WAS FAMILIAR AND WAS COMPETENT TO SUPERINTEND IN CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION THE COURT PERMITTED OVER THE OBJECTION OF THE DEFENDANT THE PLAINTIFF TO ASK A WITNESS TAPLESS WHO HAD BEEN EMPLOYED 7 YEARS AT WIDNES AND 11 YEARS AT SALTVILLE Q YOU HAVE STATED THAT YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE WORKS AT WIDNES AND THE WORKS AT SALTVILLE WHICH IS THE BETTER AND PERMITTED THE AN SWER THAT THE SALTVILLE PLANT WAS THE BEST AND ALSO A SIMILAR QUESTION AND ANSWER BY THE WITNESS NEIL MATHIESON EXCEP TION WAS ALSO RESERVED TO A QUESTION ASKED OF JOHN ALLEN WHO SUPPLIED PUMPS VALVES AND PRESSES TO THE DEFENDANTS WORKS AND HAD ALSO SUPPLIED THE SAME THINGS TO THE WIDNES PLANT AND OTHER CHEMICAL WORKS HE WAS ASKED Q WILL YOU TELL WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY REGARDING THE PLANT APPARATUS AND MACHINERY AT THE MATHIESON WORKS AT WIDNES AS REGARDS ITS UPTODATE CHARACTER I AM TALKING NOW OF 1892 WHEN YOU SECURED YOUR ORDER HE ANSWERED WELL AS FAR AS WE KNOW IT WAS THE ONLY CLASS OF VALVE AND PUMP AND PRESS THAT WAS IN USE AT THAT TIME THERE WAS NO OTHER KIND OF THAT CLASS OF WORK IN USE BUT THE KIND WE MADE WE AND OTHER FIRMS ARE MAKING SIMILAR GOODS Q WOULD YOU SAY IT WAS OF AN UPTODATE CHARAC TER A YES AND IN OVERRULING THE OBJECTION TO A QUESTION TO MARCUS ALLEN WHO TESTIFIED HE WAS A CONSULTING ENGINEER IN THE CHEMICAL BRANCH OF THE BUSINESS AND KNEW THE WORKS AT WIDNES THOROUGHLY HE WAS ASKED AS TO THE EFFICIENCY AND UP TODATE CHARACTER OF THE PLANT AND MACHINERY AND ANSWERED THAT IT WAS UPTODATE AND WAS SIMILAR TO THAT OF OTHER FIRMS OF SIMILAR CLASS MAKING AMMONIA SODA ALKALI AND THAT HE KNEW OF NIOTHING BETTER IN USE AND THAT IT COULD NOT BE SAID THAT THE 70112 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER WIDNES WORKS WERE OBSOLETE IN NONE OF THE RULINGS CAN WE SEE ANY ERROR OF ALL THESE EXCEPTIONS TO THE ADMISSION OR REJECTION OF TESTIMONY IT MAY BE FAIRLY SAID CONSIDERING THE LARGE AMOUNT OF DIRECT TESTIMONY ADDUCED BY THE DEFENDALNT AND ADMITTED IN SUPPORT OF THE ISSUES RAISED BY ITS PLEAS THAT ITS ADMISSIONI OR REJECTION COULD NOT HAVE IN REASON AFFECTED THE VERDICT OF THE JURY AND COULD NOT HAVE INJURIOUSLY AFFECTED THE DEFENDANT WE NOW COME TO THE ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR WITH RESPECT TO THE INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN BY THE TRIAL JUDGE TO THE JURY AND WITH RESPECT TO THE REFUSAL TO GIVE THOSE OFFERED BY THE DEFENDANT IT IS SETTLED LAW THAT IT IS NO GROUND OF COMPLAINT THAT THE TRIAL JUDGE REFUSES IN INSTRUCTING THE JURY TO ADOPT THE LANGUAGE PRO POSED BY COUNSEL HE MAY PRESENT THE CASE IN HIS OWN WAY USING HIS OWN LANGUAGE PROVIDED HE COVERS THE ENTIRE CASE AND DECLARES THE LAW CORRECTLY INDIANAPOLIS V HORST 93 U S 291295 ERIE R R CO V DINTER 143 U S 6074 THE COURT REFUSED THE INSTRUCTIONS ASKED FOR BY BOTH THE PLAINTIFF AND THE DEFENDANT AND THE FOLLOWING ARE THE INSTRUC TIONS WHICH THE COURT IN ITS OWN LANGUAGE GAVE THE JURY THE COURTS INSTRUCTION NO 1 THE CONTRACT IN QUESTION GAVE TO THE PLAINTIFF THE OPTION TO MAKE HIS RESIDENCE AT SALTVILLE DURING THE FIRST PERIOD OF HIS SERVICE FOR TWO OR THREE YEARS AND DURING SAID TIME HE HAD THE RIGHT TO TAKE SUCH VACATION AS COULD BE AVAILED OF WITHOUT DETRI MENT OR HINDRANCE TO THE PROPER MANAGEMENT OF THE BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE FULL TERM OF EIGHT YEARS THE SAID MATHIESON WAS NOT REQUIRED BY THE CONTRACT TO SPEND ANY MORE TIME IN AMERICA THAN HE MIGHT ELECT TO SPEND BUT HE WAS REQUIRED TO GIVE SUCH ATTENTION TO THE BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY AS MAY HAVE BEEN NECESSARY IN ORDER TO PROMOTE ITS BEST INTEREST IT FOLLOWS THAT MERE ABSENCE IN ENGLAND DURING THE SECOND PERIOD OF THE EMPLOYMENT WAS NOT OF ITSELF A BREACH OF CONTRACT BY THE PLAINTIFF UNLESS THE JURY SHALL CONSIDER UNDER ALL THE EVIDENCE IN THE CASE THAT HIS PRESENCE IN AMERICA WAS REQUIRED IN ORDER THAT HE COULD GIVE SUCH ATTENTION TO THE BUSI NESS AS WAS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO PROMOTE ITS BEST INTERESTS IN OTHER WORDS THE COURT CONSTRUES THE CONTRACT IN THIS RESPECT AS NOT REQUIRING THE PRESENCE OF THE PLAINTIFF IN AMERICA UNLESS SOME EXIGENCY OCCURRED WHICH MADE IT ESSENTIAL TO THE PROMO TION OF THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE COMPANY THAT HE SHOULD BE IN AMERICA THE COURTS INSTRUCTION NO 2 THE BURDEN OF PROOF IS ON THE PLAINTIFF TO SHOW THAT HE PERFORMED THE EXPRESS AND IMPLIED OBLIGATIONS OF THE CONTRACT 702 JAN1907 MATHIESON ALKALI WORKS V MATHITSON IN A REASONABLY EFFICIENT AND COMPETENT MANNER AND THE BURDEN OF PROOF IS ON THE DEFENDANT TO SHOW AS A GROUND OF COUNTER CLAIM THE CONVERSE OF THIS STATE OF FACT AND TO PROVE DAMAGE IN A CIVIL CASE SUCH AS THIS THE BURDEN OF PROOF IS SUSTAINED BY A PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE THE COURTS INSTRUCTION NO 3 IF THE JURY BELIEVE FROM THE PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE THAT THE PLAINTIFF REASONABLY PERFORMED THE OBLIGATIONS OF HIS CONTRACT THEY SHOULD FIND FOR THE PLAINTIFF IN THE AMOUNT SUED FOR THE COURTS INSTRUCTION NO 4 IF THE JURY BELIEVE FROM THE PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVI DENCE THAT AT THE TIME OF THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CONTRACT THE PLAINTIFF DID NOT HAVE AND EXERCISE REASONABLE KNOWLEDGE SKILL AND CARE FOR AND IN THE PERFORMANCE OF THE DUTIES DEVOLVING ON HIM UNDER SAID CONTRACT AND THAT THE COMPANY SUFFERED DAMAGES THEREBY THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT IN ARRIVING AT THEIR VER DICT THEY SHOULD DEDUCT FROM THE CLAIM OF THE PLAINTIFF THE AMOUNT OF THE SAID DAMAGES AND THAT IF THE AMOUNT OF SAID DAMAGES EXCEEDS THE CLAIM OF THE PLAINTIFF A VERDICT OVER FOR SUCH EXCESS AGAINST THE PLAINTIFF AND IN FAVOR OF THE DEFENDANT SHOULD BE GIVEN THE COURTS INSTRUCTION NO 5 IF THE JURY BELIEVE FROM THE PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVI DENCE THAT THE PLAINTIFF SOLELY BECAUSE OF IGNORANCE INCOMPE TENCE OR NEGLIGENCE ERECTED FOR THE DEFENDANT WORKS OF AN AN TIQUATED STYLE AND PLAN AND SUCH AS WERE INSUFFICIENT FOR THE PURPOSE INTENDED AND PLACED THEREIN ENGINES PUMPS AND OTHER MACHINERY AND APPLIANCES WHICH WERE ANTIQUATED AND INSUFFI CIENT AND AT AN EXPENSE WHICH WAS UNREASONABLE AID UNNEC ESSARY ALLOWANCES MAY BE MADE IN BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT OF THE DAMAGE IF ANY THUS OCCASIONED WHETHER BY ORIGINAL COST BY LOSS IN OPERATION OR BY NECESSARY REPAIRS AND RECONSTRUCTION BUT IN THIS CONNECTION THE JURY WILL CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT THE PLANT AT WIDES ENGLAND WAS CONTEMPLATED BY BOTH PARTIES TO THE CONTRACT AS THE MODEL AFTER WHICH THE SALTVILLE PLANT WOULD BE CONSTRUCTED AND WHETHER OR NOT THIS CONTEMPLATED DESIGN WAS REASONABLY CARRIED OUT THE COURTS INSTRUCTION NO 6 THE JURY ARE INSTRUCTED THAT WHEN THE PLAINTIFF ENTERED INTO THE CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT OF AUGUST 15 1893 THE LAW IMPLIED A PROMISE AND UNDERTAKING ON HIS PART THAT HE WOULD USE REASONABLE CARE AND DILIGENCE AND THAT HE HAD AND WOULD EXER CISE REASONABLE SKILL AND KNOWLEDGE IN THE PROSECUTION OF HIS DUTIES UNDER SAID CONTRACT BUT IN DECIDING ON THIS QUESTION THE JURY WILL CONSIDER THE KNOWLEDGE HAD BY THE DEFENDANT AT 70312 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER THE TIME OF MAKING THE CONTRACT OF THE PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE AND TRAINING OF THE PLAINTIFF THE COURTS INSTRUCTION NO 7 THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT THE CONTRACT SUED ON BY THE PLAINTIFF IS AN ENTIRE ONE AND THAT HE CANNOT IN ANY EVENT RECOVER THE ENTIRE AMOUNT SUED FOR BY HIM UNLESS THEY BELIEVE THAT HE PERFORMED IN THE MANNER ABOVE SET OUT EACH AND EVERY MATERIAL DUTY REQUIRED OF HIM UNDER SAID CONTRACT THESE INSTRUCTIONS IT SEEMS TO US ARE CORRECT IN LAW AND WERE COMPREHENSIBLE BY THE JURY AND FULLY AND FAIRLY COVERED THE CASE MADE BY THE PLEADINGS AND THE EVIDENCE THE DEFEND ANTS COUNSEL POINTED OUT TO THE COURT NO SPECIFIC ERROR AND EX CEPTED TO THE COURTS INSTRUCTIONS ONLY SO FAR AS THEY WERE IN CONFLICT WITH THE TWELVE INSTRUCTIONS ASKED FOR IN BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT IT WOULD BE USELESS TO ANALYZE THE TWELVE PROPOSI TIONS OFFERED BY THE DEFENDANT AND TO COMPARE THEM WITH COURTS INSTRUCTIONS IN OUR OPINION THERE IS NO SUBSTANTIAL CONFLICT BETWEEN THE COURTS INSTRUCTIONS AND THE PROPOSITIONS OF LAW EXPRESSED IN THE INSTRUCTIONS ASKED BY THE DEFENDANT THE ONLY REALLY MATERIAL DIFFERENCE IS IN THE QUALIFICATIONS WHICH THE COURT MADE IN ITS FIFTH INSTRUCTION BY SUGGESTING TO THE JURY THAT IN DETERMINING WHETHER THE WORKS AT SALTVILLE WERE ANTIQUATED AND INSUFFICIENT THEY MIGHT CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT THE PLANT AT WIDNES ENGLAND WAS INTENDED BY BOTH PARTIES TO BE THE NMODEL FOR THE NEW WORKS AT SALTVILLE THIS QUALIFICATION AS EXPRESSED IN THE FIFTH INSTRUCTION WE THINK WAS PROPER AND JUSTIFIED BY THE EVIDENCE BOTH ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF AND DEFENDANT THE OTHER QUALIFICATION MADE BY THE COURT WAS IN ITS SIXTH INSTRUCTION VIZ THAT IN DECIDING WHETHER THE PLAIN TIFF HAD EXHIBITED THE SKILL AND KNOWLEDGE WHICH THE CONTRACT IMPLIED THAT HE POSSESSED THE JURY SHOULD CONSIDER THE DEFEND ANTS KNOWLEDGE OF THE PLAINTIFFS PREVIOUS TRAINING AND EX PERIENCE THIS IT SEEMS TO US WAS A REASONABLE AND PROPER QUALIFICA TION THE DEFENDANTS PRESIDENT WHO MADE THE CONTRACT KNEW THAT THE PLAINTIFF HAD NO EXPERIENCE WITH THE NEW AND DIFFICULT CONDITIONS WHICH EMBARRASSED THE ESTABLISHING OF THE NEW WORKS IN AMERICA BUT CHOOSE FOR REASONS THAT CAN ONLY BE SURMISED TO URGE HIM TO COME TO AMERICA AND TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT FOR EIGHT YEARS IT SEEMS TO US THAT THE TRIAL JUDGE CONDUCTED THE CASE WITH PAINSTAKING CARE AND WITH THE STEADY PURPOSE OF FULLY AND FAIRLY GETTING IT BEFORE THE JURY AND OF INSTRUCTING THEM AS TO THE LAW APPLICABLE TO IT IN CLEAR AND INTELLIGIBLE LANGUAGE THE VERDICT IS LARGE BUT IT WAS JUSTIFIED BY THE CONTRACT THE JURY PROBABLY WERE IMPRESSED WITH THE IDEA THAT THE DISAPPOINTMENT 704 JAN1907 MATHI4SON ALKALI WORKS V MATHIESON OF THE EXTRAVAGANT HOPES OF THE PROMOTERS OF THE ENTERPRISE WAS DUE TO THE FAILURE TO FIND CLOSE AT HAND MATERIAL OF THE QUALITY AND KIND THAT WAS EXPECTED AND NOT DUE TO THE FAULT OF THE PLAIN TIFF THAT THE DEFENDANTS OFFICERS NEVER UNTIL SUIT WAS ENTERED DISPUTED THE PLAINTIFFS RIGHT TO HIS SALARY UNDER THE CONTRACT AND NEVER NOTIFIED THE PLAINTIFF DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY THAT THE DEFENDANT WISHED TO END THE ENGAGEMENT THE ISSUE AS TO WHETHER THE PLAINTIFF WAS ANSWERABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES SUS TAINED BY THE DEFENDANT WAS FAIRLY LEFT TO THE JURY AND WAS DE TERMINED BY THEM JUDGMENT AFFIRMED BOYD DISTRICT JUDGE DISSENTING I CONCUR IN THE OPINION OF THE COURT AS TO THE LAW IN REGARD TO THE QUESTION OF JURISDICTION RAISED AND ALSO THE AMEND MENT TO PLAINTIFFS PLEADING BUT I AM NOT IN HARMONY WITH THE CONCLUSION THAT THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT BELOW SHOULD BE AFFIRMED WITHOUT GOING INTO THE CASE ARID CONSIDERING ALL OF THE EXCEPTIONS OF WHICH THERE ARE MANY I THINK THERE ARE CER TAIN OF THEM TAKEN TO THE ADMISSION AND EXCLUSION OF TESTIMONY IN THE TRIAL IN WHICH THERE IS ERROR THE PLAINTIFF BELOW INTRODUCED A WITNESS BY THE NAME OF TAPLEY TO WHOM THIS QUESTION WAS PROPOUNDED Q YOU HAVE STATED THAT YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE WORKS AT WIDNES AND THE WORKS AT SALTVILLE WHICH IS THE BETTER THE DEFENDANTS COUNSEL OBJECTED TO THIS QUESTION THE OB JECTION WAS OVERRULED AND THE WITNESS PERMITTED TO ANSWER HIS ANSWER BEING AS FOLLOWS A THE SALTVILLE PLANT WAS THE BETTER THE DEFENDANTS COUNSEL ALSO OBJECTED TO THE ANSWER AND THE OBJECTION WAS OVERRULED AND THERE WAS AN EXCEPTION THERE IS NO PLEADING OR ISSUE IN THE CASE WHICH INVOLVES A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE WORKS AT WIDNES WHICH IS IN ENGLAND AND THE WORKS AT SALTVILLE THE CONTENTION OF THE DEFENDANT WAS THAT THE PLAINTIFF HAD FAILED AND NEGLECTED TO ERECT AND EQUIP THE SALTVILLE PLANT PROPERLY AND THE ISSUES RAISED ARE SUBSTAN TIALLY AS TO WHETHER THE PLAINTIFF DISCHARGED HIS DUTY TO THE DEFENDANT IN THIS RESPECT AS CONTEMPLATED BY THE CONTRACT CON SEQUENTLY IT BECAME NECESSARY TO INQUIRE WHETHER OR NOT THE PLAINTIFF HAD BEEN NEGLIGENT AND CARELESS IN THE ERECTION OF THE SALTVILLE PLANT AND THE SELECTION AND PURCHASE OF MACHINERY AND APPLIANCES FOR ITS OPERATION THERE IS NO STIPULATION IN THE CONTRACT THAT THE PLANT AT WIDNES WAS TO BE THE MODEL AFTER WHICH THE SALTVILLE PLANT WAS TO BE CONSTRUCTED THEREFORE TESTIMONY AS TO WHAT THE WIDNES PLANT WAS COULD NOT BE PERTI NENT IF A WITNESS PARTIAL TO THE WIDNES PLANT COULD BE PER MITTED TO TESTIFY THAT IT WAS A GOOD PLANT AND THAT THE SALTVILLE 70512 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER PLANT WAS BETTER THEN ANOTHER WITNESS WOULD BE COMPETENT TO TESTIFY THAT THE WIDNES PLANT WAS BAD AND THE SALTVILLE PLANT WORSE THE ISSUE WOULD THUS HE TRANSFERRED FROM THE QUESTION OF FAITHFUL DISCHARGE OF THE PLAINTIFFS DUTIES UNDER THE CONTRACT TO AN INVESTIGATION OF TLE RELATIVE MERITS OF THE TWO PLANTS FURTHER IT MAY BE THAT THE WIDNES PLANT WAS A GOOD ONE THAT IT WAS WELL ADAPTED TO THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH IT WAS ERECTED IN THE LOCALITY IN WHICH IT WAS SITUATED AND YET ITS CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY UNSUITED TO THE CONDITIONS SURROUNDING THE PLANT AT SALTVILLE THE INJECTION OF SUCH TES TIMONY WAS CALCULATED TO MISLEAD THE MINDS OF THE JURY FROM THE TRUE ISSUE AND TO CAUSE THEM TO CONSIDER THE CHARACTER OF THE TWO PLANTS RATHER THAN THE QUESTION WHETHER THE PLAINTIFF HAD ERECTED SUCH A PLANT AT SAJTVILE AS HIS CONTRACT REQUIRED I THINK THEREFORE THAT THE ADMISSION OF THIS TESTIMONY WAS ERROR THE NEXT EXCEPTION WHICH I WILL CONSIDER IS ONE RELATING TO THE EXCLUSION OF TESTIMONY OFFERED BY THE DEFENDANT IN ORDER TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE PURPOSES OF THE TESTIMONY I DEEM IT NECESSARY TO RECITE CERTAIN OF THE FACTS AND AMONG THEM THE FOLLOWING I TAKE FROM THE TESTIMONY OF THE PLAINTIFF HIMSELF I WAS GENERAL MANAGER IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE SALTVILLE PLANT AND EVERYBODY ELSE WAS UNDER ME I BROUGHT OUT SEVERAL SKILLED PEOPLE TO HELP ME AFTER EXECUTION OF THE CONTRACT WHICH WAS AUGUST 15 1893 I RETURNED TO SALTVILLE AND REMAINED THERE FOR TWO YEARS WORKING ERECTING THE PLANT OR ALMOST TWO YEARS WHEN I RETURNED TO ENGLAND WITH MY FAMILY IN JULY I THINK 1895 AND RETURNED AGAIN AS FAR AS I REMEMBER IN SEPTEMBER OF THE SAME YEAR AS STATED RETURNED TO SALTVILLE IN SEPTEMBER 1895 HAVING STARTED A PORTION OF THE PLANT ON THE 4TH OF JULY 1895 I REMAINED AT SALTVILLE UNTIL LATE IN DECEMBER I THINK ABOUT THE 18TH OF DECEMBER ON RETURNING AND RECEIVING MY ACCOUNT FROM R T WILSON  CO WITH WHOM I BANKED I FOUND THAT THEY HAD REDUCED MY SALARY FROM 3000 POUNDS TO 1500 POUNDS DATING FROM THE DAY I LEFT SALTVILLE IN DECEMBER 1895 I REMAINED THEN IN ENGLAND FOR SOME TIME HAD CORRESPONDENCE WITH MR ARNOLD AND LETTERS WITH RELATION TO THE BUSINESS LOOKED AFTER THE ORDERING OF SOME MACHINERY FOR THEM WHICH MR ARNOLD INSTRUCTED ME TO ORDER I DID NOT RETURN UNTIL IN APRIL 1896 I LEFT ENGLAND LATE IN APRIL ARRIVING AT SALTVILLE EARLY IN MAY 1896 WHEN I ARRIVED IN NEW YORK I FOUND THAT ANOTHER MANAGER HAD BEEN APPOINTED MR ARNOLD INFORMED ME SO AND THE MEN WERE TO TAKE ALL INSTRUCTIONS FROM HIM THE NEW MAN AGER WAS MR J V JOHNSON FINDING THAT ANOTHER MANAGER HAD BEEN APPOINTED AND KNOWING FROM MR ARNOLD THAT THE MEN IJAN 7061907 MATHIESON ALKALI WORKS V MATHIESON WOULD TAKE THEIR INSTRUCTIONS FROM HIM I SIMPLY WROTE TO MR ARNOLD THAT I WOULD GIVE HIM ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS I COULD AT THIS TIME MR ARNOLD WAS PRESIDENT OF THE COMPANY AND THE PLAINTIFF ALSO INTRODUCED THE FOLLOWING LETTER DATED AT SALTVILLE VIRGINIA MAY 7 1896 ADDRESSED TO MR ARNOLD AND SIGNED BY THE PLAINTIFF I DULY ARRIVED HERE AND FOUND THE WORKS DOING WELL THEY ARE RUNNING THREE UNITS AND TURNING OUT NEARLY THE FULL QUAN TITY IF THE BRINE AND WATER SUPPLY WERE UP TO REQUIREMENTS THERE WOULD BE NO TROUBLE WILL YOU KINDLY TELL ME IF I MAY EXPECT THE COMPANY TO PAY MY EXPENSES FOR THIS TRIP AS I WISH TO MAKE ALL ARRANGEMENTS OF COURSE I AM GIVING NO ORDERS HERE BUT AM LEAVING A LIST OF ALL MATTERS WHICH REQUIRE ATTENTION WITH MR JOHNSON IT IS A FURTHER FACT THAT SHORTLY AFTER THE DATE OF THIS LETTER THE PLAINTIFF LEFT THE UNITED STATES AND DID NOT RETURN AGAIN DURING THE EXISTENCE OF THE CONTRACT THE PLAINTIFF MATHIE SON WAS INTRODUCED AS A WITNESS IN HIS OWN BEHALF AND UPON CROSS EXAMINATION THE COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANT PROPOUNDED THE TWO FOLLOWING QUESTIONS 1 Q I WILL ASK YOU IF THE REASON YOU DID NOT RETURN TO THE UNITED STATES MEANING FRPM JUNE 1 1896 TO FEB 1 1901 THE END OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THE CONTRACT SUED ON WAS BECAUSE MR JOHNSON WAS APPOINTED GENERAL SUPERINTEND ENT  2 Q IF MR JOHNSON HAD NOT BEEN APPOINTED GENERAL SUPERINTENDENT WOULD YOU HAVE RETURNED TO THE WORKS AT SALT VILLE DURING THE PERIOD OF YOUR CONTRACT BOTH OF THESE QUESTIONS WERE RULED OUT BY THE TRIAL COURT TO WHICH THE DEFENDANT EXCEPTED THE SELECTION OF JOHNSON SHOWS THAT IN THE OPINION OF THE AUTHORITIES OF THE COMPANY IT WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE SOME ONE PRESENT AT THE PLANT TO SUPERIN TEND AND MANAGE ITS OPERATIONS THE PLAINTIFF WAS NOT THERE AS HE ADMITS AND IN FACT HE ADMITS THAT HE WAS ABSENT FOR THE WHOLE OF THE TIME FOR WHICH HE SEEKS COMPENSATION AND FOR WHICH HE RECOVERED A JUDGMENT PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST AGGRE GATING UPWARDS OF 40000 HE WAS IN ENGLAND AND A FEW LETTERS WRITTEN BY HIM CONSTITUTED SO FAR AS IS SHOWN BY THE RECORD ALL THAT HE DID FOR WHICH HE RECOVERED THIS LARGE SUNI OF MONEY IT IS SET FORTH IN THE CONTRACT THAT AFTER TWO OR THREE YEARS OF THE TIME HAD ELAPSED IT WAS AGREED THAT FOR THE RE MAINDER OF THE TIME THE PLAINTIFF WAS NOT REQUIRED TO SPEND ANY MORE TIME IN THIS COUNTRY THAN HE MIGHT ELECT TO SPEND BUT THERE IS A QUALIFICATION IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING VIZ THE OB JECT AND PURPOSE HOWEVER BEING THAT HE SHALL GIVE SUCH ATTEN 3 70712 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER TION TO THE BUSINESS AS MAY BE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO PROMOTE ITS BEST INTERESTS EVEN IF THIS REQUIREMENT HAD NOT BEEN EXPRESSLY STATED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THE LAW WOULD CONSTRUE THE CONTRACT TO INCLUDE IT IT IS AN UNDISPUTED FACT THAT THE PLAIN TIFF HAD CONTRACTED TO DISCHARGE THE DUTIES OF GENERAL SUPERIN TENDENT OF THIS COMPANY FOR EIGHT YEARS SUCH PORTION OF THE FIRST THREE YEARS AS MIGHT BE NECESSARY WAS TO BE DEVOTED TO THE CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT OF THE PLANT AND THE REMAINDER OF THE TIME HE WAS TO GIVE SUCH ATTENTION TO THE BUSINESS AS MIGHT BE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO PROMOTE ITS BEST INTERESTS IN THE TRIAL OF THE CASE THE DEFENDANT WAS RESISTING THE RIGHT OF THE PLAINTIFF TO RECOVER PRIMARILY ON THE GROUND THAT HE HAD FAILED TO COM PLY WITH THE CONTRACT THAT HE HAD NOT SERVED THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE COMPANY THAT HE HAD REMAINED AWAY FROM THE BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY FROM SOMETIME IN 1896 TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE CONTRACT THAT HE HAD LEFT THE PLANT AND ITS OPERATION WITHOUT A SUPERINTENDENT TO MANAGE AND DIRECT ITS AFFAIRS AND THAT WHEN THE DEFENDANT IN THIS CONDITION HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO SELECT JOHNSON AS SUPERINTENDENT THE PLAINTIFF BECAME DISPLEASED AND GAVE HIMSELF NO FURTHER CONCERN ABOUT THE COMPANYS BUSINESS IN VIEW OF THIS IT WAS UNDOUBTEDLY COMPETENT FOR THE DEFEND ANT TO SHOW THAT THE PLAINTIFF HAD REMAINED AWAY AND NEGLECTED THE INTERESTS OF THE BUSINESS BECAUSE OF JOHNSONS APPOINTMENT IT MIGHT WELL BE ARGUED UPON THE TESTIMONY OF THE PLAINTIFF HIM SELF IN WHICH HE SAIDUPON HIS VISIT TO SALTVILLE IN 1896 THAT FINDING ANOTHER MANAGER HAD BEEN APPOINTED AND KNOWING FROM MR ARNOLD THAT THE MEN WOULD TAKE THEIR INSTRUCTIONS FROM HIM I SIMPLY WROTE MR ARNOLD ETC AND FURTHER IN THE LETTER OF MAY 7 1896 IN WHICH HE SAYS OF COURSE I AM GIVING NO ORDERS HERE BUT AM LEAVING A LIST OF ALL MATTERS WHICH REQUIRE ATTENTION WITH MR JOHNSON THAT THE THEORY OF THE DE FENDANT WAS TRUE THAT BECAUSE OF THE APPOINTMENT OF JOHNSON THE PLAINTIFF HAD MADE UP HIS MIND TO TAKE NO FURTHER INTEREST IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE COMPANY I NOTE IN THE RECORD THE GROUNDS UPON WHICH THE TRIAL COURT EXCLUDED THE FIRST OF THESE TWO QUESTIONS WHICH ARE AS FOLLOWS THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF THE CONTRACT WHILE CALLING FOR SUCH ATTENTION FROM MR MATHIESON AS THE BUSINESS MAY REQUIRE DOES NOT REQUIRE HIM TO COME TO AMERICA AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE FIRST PERIOD BUT GIVES HIM THE OPTION IN THAT RESPECT CONSE QUENTLY AS HE WAS NOT REQUIRED BY THE CONTRACT TO BE IN AMERICA AT ALL FROM 1896 TO 1901 ANY EFFORT NOW TO CONTRADICT THE WIT NESS AS TO HIS REASONS FOR NOT COMING HERE WOULD BE AN EFFORT TO CONTRADICT ON AN IMMATERIAL POINT AND IN EXCLUDING THE SEC OND OF THESE TWO QUESTIONS AND THE ANSWER THERETO THE COURT MADE THIS STATEMENT THE CONTRACT IS PROBABLY RIGHTLY TO BE 708 JAN1907 MATHIESON ALKALI WORKS V MATHIESON CONSTRUED AS MEANING THAT IF SOME EXIGENCY OCCURRED WHICH MADE THE PRESENCE OF MR MATHIESON IN AMERICA ESSENTIAL TO THE PROPER CONDUCT OF THE PLANT HIS PRESENCE HERE WOULD BE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH HIS CONTRACT BUT THE COURT IS OF THE FURTHER OPINION THAT NOTICE OF SUCH EXIGENCY SHOULD HAVE BEET CONVEYED TO MR MATHIESON BEFORE HIS PRESENCE IN AMERICA DURING SUCH PERIOD COULD HAVE BEEN REQUIRED NO AVOWAL HAV ING BEEN MADE THAT SUCH NOTICE WAS GIVEN TO MR MATHIESON THE COURT IS OF THE OPINION THAT HE NEED NOT ANSWER THE QUESTION I AM UNABLE TO CONCUR IN THIS CONSTRUCTION OF THE CONTRACT THE AGREEMENT WAS FO PAY PLAINTIFF FIFTEEN HUNDRED POUNDS 6000 IN OUR MONEY PER ANNUM FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THE CONTRACT AFTER THE TWO OR THREE YEARS SET APART IN THE FIRST PARAGRAPH FOR THE ERECTION ETC OF THE PLANT HAD ELAPSED THE OBLIGATION OF PLAINTIFF TO THE COMPANY HOWEVER DID NOT CEASE WHEN THE SPECIFIC WORK PROVIDED FOR IN THE PARA GRAPH NAMED HAD BEEN COMPLETED HE WAS EMPLOYED AS GEN ERAL SUPERINTENDENT FOR THE TERM OF EIGHT YEARS AND HE WAS BOUND BY THE CONTRACT TO DISCHARGE FAITHFULLY AND FULLY THE DUTIES ATTACHING TO THAT EMPLOYMENT WHATEVER SUCH DUTIES MAY HAVE BEEN IT IS TRUE AS BEFORE STATED THAT IT WAS AGREED THAT HE SHALL NOT BE REQUIRED TO SPEND ANY MORE TIME IN AMERICA THAN HE MAY ELECT TO SPEND AND THE TRIAL JUDGE CONSTRUED THIS TO MEAN THAT THE PLAINTIFF WAS NOT REQUIRED TO COME TO AMERICA AT ALL AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE FIRST PERIOD BUT THAT THE CON TRACT GAVE HIM THE OPTION IN THAT RESPECT IN MY OPINION IT DEVOLVED UPON THE PLAINTIFF TO ELECT TO SPEND ENOUGH OF HIS TIME HERE TO SUBSERVE PROPERLY THE PURPOSES OF HIS EMPLOYMENT AND PROMOTE THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE DEFENDANT UNDER THE TERMS OF THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THE CONTRACT DURING THE TWO OR THREE YEARS FOR THE CONSTRUCTION ETC OF THE PLANT IT IS PROVIDED THAT PLAINTIFF IS TO HAVE SUCH VACATION DURING THIS PERIOD AS HE CAN AVAIL OF WITHOUT DETRIMENT OR HINDRANCE TO THE PROPER MANAGE MENT OF THE BUSINESS OF THE SAID COMPANY THE LATTER CLAUSE OF PARAGRAPH TWO IS SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME IN EFFECT FOR WHILST THE CLAUSE CONFIDES IT TO PLAINTIFF TO SPEND ONLY SUCH TIME IN AMERICA AS HE MAY ELECT YET IN THE EXERCISE OF THIS ELECTION HE MUST GIVE SUCH ATTENTION TO THE BUSINESS AS MAY BE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO PROMOTE ITS BEST INTERESTS IT WAS ENCUMBENT UPON HIM TO KEEP HIMSELF INFORMED AS TO THE CONDITION OF THE ESTAB LISHMENT OF WHICH HE WAS THE GENERAL SUPERINTENDENT HOW ELSE COULD HE CONSULT ITS BEST INTERESTS IF HIS PRESENCE AT THE WORKS WAS NECESSARY IT WAS HIS DUTY TO KNOW IT NOT THAT OF THE DEFEND ANT TO ADVISE HIM I HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASSUME THAT IN MAKING THIS CONTRACT THE DEFENDANT RELIED UPON THE SKILL AND CAPACITY OF THE MAN EMPLOYED TO SUPERINTEND THE WORK AND HAD CONFIDENCE 70912 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER IN HIS JUDGMENT AND DISCRETION I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THAT UNDER THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT IT WAS THE RIGHT OF THE PLAINTIFF TO ABSENT HIMSELF ALTOGETHER FROM THE PLANT BUT THAT WHILST IT WAS LEFT TO HIM TO SPEND SUCH TIME HERE AS HE MIGHT ELECT THIS PRIV ILEGE WAS TO BE EXERCISED WITH DUE REGARD TO THE INTERESTS OF THE COMPANY I THINK THEREFORE THAT IT WAS COMPETENT FOR THE DEFENDANT TO SHOW IF IT COULD BY ITS OWN WITNESSES OR BY CROSS EXAMINATION OF THE WITNESSES FOR THE PLAINTIFF THAT PLAINTIFF HAD FAILED TO GIVE THE ATTENTION TO THE BUSINESS OF DEFENDANT RE QUIRED OF HIM BY THE CONTRACT TO SHOW IF POSSIBLE THAT BECAUSE HE WAS PIQUED ON ACCOUNT OF THE APPOINTMENT OF JOHNSON HE CEASED TO FULFILL HIS OBLIGATION AS GENERAL SUPERINTENDENT I AM THEREFORE OF THE OPINION THAT THE RULING OF THE COURT EXCLUDING THE QUESTIONS UNDER CONSIDERATION WAS ERROR THAT THE QUESTIONS WERE COMPETENT AND MATERIAL AND THAT DEFENDANT WAS ENTITLED TO HAVE SEVERALLY THERETO THE ANSWER OF THE WITNESS THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER EXCEPTIONS SOME OF THEM TAKEN DURING THE TRIAL TO THE ADMISSION AND EXCLUSION OF TESTIMONEY AND OTHERS BASED UPON THE CHARGE OF THE COURT TO THE JURY I DO NOT DEEM IT NECESSARY HOWEVER TO CONSIDER THEM OR ANY OF THEM IT APPEARS TO ME FROM READING THE RECORD OF THE COURSE OF THE TRIAL THAT MANY OF THE RULINGS MADE BY THE LEARNED JUDGE PRE SIDING WERE THE RESULT OF HIS CONSTRUCTION OF THE CONTRACT SUED UPON IN WHICH CONSTRUCTION AS I HAVE BEFORE STATED IN MY OPINION THERE WAS ERROR NOTE WE ARE PUBLISHING THIS VERY INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT DECISION OF THE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS MAINLY BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO GO TO THE EXTREME LIMIT IN ALLOWING THE PLAINTIFF TO SO AMEND HIS DECLARATION UNDER THE VA CODE AS TO CHANGE WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY AN ACTION ON AN UNSEALED CONTRACT TO ONE ON A SEALED CONTRACT AMEND MENTS ARE NOT GENERALLY ALLOWED WHICH ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THE NATURE OF THE PLEADINGS OR CHANGE THE CAUSE OF ACTION SUCH CARELESS NESS IN DRAWING THE DECLARATION AS WAS MANIFESTED IN THIS CASE IS NOT TO BE ENCOURAGED 710 JAN

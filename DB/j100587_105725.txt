in Surgery by Mr Francis Geach Surgeon in Ply mouth Communicated by John Huxham M D F R R S Extract of a Letter from John Huxham M D F R S to W Watson M D F R S dated at Plymouth the 10th of May 1763 I Have herewith sent you two extraordinary cases which Mr Francis Geach one of our surgeons put into my hands some time ago I think there are some things remarkable in them I have sent also three of the concretions found in the gallblad der of the icteric person The three others I reserve for making some experiments on them They are all nearly of the same shape and size The person wounded in the eye is now consi derably stronger and better The observation that wounds of the brain often cause a paralysis on the opposite side of the body is as old as Hippocrates and is taken notice of also by Aretaeus I am very well assured that the facts are exactly related and I choose to send them in the words nay even in the hand writing of Mr Geach From232 C A S E I S I R A Man aged fortytwo years not much addicted to spirituous li quors nor too rigidly abstemious seven months ago received a violent blow on the right hypochondri um soon after he was seized with the colic and had a yellow suffusion over his skin himself dated the aera of his misfortune from the blow At first he had a diarrhaea but at last became so costive as to have no regular intestinal discharge but by the help of lenitives He was much emaciated towards the end of life his skin was astonishingly yellow and dry as parchment or leather shrivelled by the fire Many medical processes were employed ineffectually He had no considerable pain any where A week be fore his death the left arm turned quite black He had frequent haemorrhages from his nose On dissection the liver was found considerably enlarged external ly of a pale lead colour harder and more solid than in a sound state but not schirrous internally more porous and spungy The inner substance not deviat ing from its natural colour seemed to be made up of distinct fibres intersecting one another with va cuities between them equal in size to the small cells of honeycombs The ductus cysticus and hepaticus as well as the pori bilarii were perfectly ligamentous The gallbladder had changed its pyriform figure and affected that of a cylinder the fibres of which were Read June 23 1763233 were hard white and compacted The pylorus and the duodenum were in a similar state The cir cular fibres of the pylorus were rigid beyond conjec ture The concretions six in number each weigh ing half a drachm and specifically heavier than wa ter a circumstance unusual were all ranged in a par allel line and tallying pretty exactly with one ano ther so completely filled up the tube for it might be callled with more propriety so than bladder as to allow but little intermediate space The passage into the duodenum was almost closed up Scarce any sincere gall issued forth on incision but a small quan tity of a turbid saponaceous fluid not unlike choco late in colour came out or rather was expressed out graduallyThe bile not finding a ready exit through the ductus choledocus stagnated probably in its re pository became diseased and acquiring the consist ence of soapy dregs proved the constituents of those concretions which on experiment are found com bustible as wax and as no fermentation arises from pouring acids upon them it may be concluded the bile is no alkali The omentum was almost destroy ed the little that remained of it was hard and black and afforded no ill emblem of sea weed when dried The glands of the mesentery were in some parts schirrous in others they represented small and dis tinct steatomas It may be needless to observe what is common to other dead bodies that the distension of the stomach and intestines was in the greatest ex tremity VOL LIII I i C A S E234 C A S E II MR James Ld midshipman of his majestys ship Liverpool in a riot December 10 1762 was wounded in the left eye a small sword entered in at the external an gle and passing quite through the eye towards the basis struck against the inner part of the orbit He fell down instantaneously senseless with loss of speech and an hemiplegia of the opposite side blood was im mediately drawn the texture of which was not strong ly cohering the next morning he was found lying upon his back with the right eye widely opened and the pupil though in a light room considerably dilated This eye was incapable of discerning ob jects never winking at the waving of the hand or the close application of the finger though sometimes it was convulsed The left eye was extruded from its orbit and enlarged to the size of a pullets egg though destitute of all its humours his pulse beat at long in tervals with a lazy motion and stopped upon gentle pressure the body was not feverish but preserved a na tural heat the paralytic side arm and thigh excepted which were livid cold and rigid the lancet was employed without exciting any sensation and blisters lay on several days without raising any vesications these benumbed parts were constantly bedewed with clammy sweat He was devoid of anxiety or in quietude the powers of nature seemed to be almost suspended and life to be carried on only through the large organs and vessels The functions of the 5 lower Read June 23 1763235 lower belly were debilitated lenient and strong purg atives producing no irritation in the stomach and in testines and clysters though repeatedly injected were never repelled The urine was emitted by drops only and sometimes it would run off suddenly in a deluge his hearing though not quite lost was con siderably impaired he lay lethargic and dead almost to every thing though by pulling the arms and shak ing the body by loud and frequent calling by de siring him to extend his tongue he would gape wide ly and forgetting seemingly what had been said to him keep his mouth wide open when the tongue might be seen quivering and retracted Five weeks elapsed in this state of insensibility every thing he took was with voracity but without relish and with out distinction About this time a new and dreadful symptom began to threaten the jaw seemed to be moved with difficulty and liquids only could be pour ed down the hypocondria were hard and distended and every effort to procure an intestinal discharge proved ineffectual when very large eruptions of the miliary kind were suddenly diffused over the sound parts From that critical moment he perspired freely and had an easy motion of the jaw his urine was rendered in a due quantity and purgatives of the lenient kind easily operated the hypochondria were soft and equal the discharge from the eye which hitherto had been acrid was now copious and laud able the sound eye had its motion he could see dis tinctly and seemed in other respects sensible when roused from his stupefaction soon after he could bear to be moved from the bed to a chair without fatigue I i 2 the236 the paralytic parts were rubbed with vinegar and mustard and he took the following medicines Pulv valerian ss  Cast Rus gr 4 Spec Diambrae gr iij Syrup Croci q s m f Bolus ter die sumend ex haustu seri sinapini A cataplasm of bread and milk had been daily applied to asswage the inflammation and swelling of the eye and a decoction of thyme and mus tard was employed as a gargarism to help the suppression of voice Soon as he began visibly to mend he had sometimes loud and sudden bursts of laughter and sometimes only a long conti nued silent simpering a species of convulsion not un like that called by the Greek physicians    save only that this was not attended with a fever When he attempted to walk he had such gestures as accompany the St Vituss dance and seemed a per fect idiot throwing eagerly forward one leg and dragging the other trembling after His appetite is now naturally moderate his sleep sound and refresh ing his hearing acute he speaks but drawls out his words rather indistinctly than articulately the para lytic arm and thigh are again animated and recover but slowly their flexibility and extension He tells me that he remembred nothing from the moment he received the injury to the time he recovered and sat up there was a temporary privation of the intellec tual faculties It may be worth while to observe that though several large sloughs were thrown off from237 from the Eye though the suppuration was in a large quantity yet the bulk of the parts did not diminish nor the inflammation lessen till an astringent fotus of red roseleaves and port wine was applied which so effectually braced up the relaxed parts that the lids now cover the deformity Though it may be diffi cult to account satisfactorily for the paralysis of the opposite side yet monsieur de la Faye  has something pertinent to the matter the passage is not long and may be worth transcribing La Moelle Allongee nest que le prolongement de la substance medullaire du cerveau  du cervelet Les fibres qui la composent se croisent de

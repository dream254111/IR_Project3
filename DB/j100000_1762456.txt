velocity of the surface or emergent wave By connecting these points by rectangular coordinates an equilateral hyperbola is developed the centre of which is the focus x and the character of which depends on the depth of the focus The hyperbola becomes more and more triangular in form as the depth becomes less as in taking the surface at cd cdC until if the focus is at the surface the hyperbola becomes a rightangled triangle ie the surface wave passes over equal spaces in equal times If therefore we plot ac curately the times on XB and the corresponding places on CI we may develop the hyperbola and calculate its centre or else by accurate trial we may find a point which shall be the centre of circles passing through corresponding times and places That point will be the focus Such is a very general account of the method given in my own way For more accurate detail See bachs work must be consulted We believe that this method in a thickly settled country dotted over with observatories on railroadstations where accurate time is kept will prove the most accurate Dutton and Hayden object to this method that it is important to have the accurate time of arrival T r S u d FIG 3 of the wave because there are two kinds of waves  the normal and transverse which run with different velocities The answer to this is that it is only over a comparatively small area that on any method observation can be relied on for estimatillg depth In spection of Fig 3 shows that the arm of the hyberbola 07ery soon becomes almost straight the velocity of emergence at any con siderable distance becomes sensibly the same as that of the spher ical wave and therefore can no longer indicate depth But over the small area where the curve of the hyperbola or change of velocity is rapid the time of arrival of the different waves would not greatly differ At any rate the use of seismographs which decompose the complex earthmotions will record these different waves separately and thus enable us to determine the law of decrease of one of them the normal with accuracy In conclusion we would insist that we cannot any longer afford to study earthquakes without seismographs The Geological Sur a7ey ought to have these in different parts of the country The University of California has recently gotten three of these of the best character Ewings and GrayMilnes which will soon be

longitude 70 4I I5 west in an inlet having a width of a little more than half a mile I am thus particular in gting the width because in a very narrow tidal harbor with the ice fast on either shore the line of flotation of the ice xvould sensibly alter with a rising or falling tide In this instance I was particular in watching for such a difference under these opposite conditions but if present it was insensible The determination ras made on Feb 3 I885 when the temper ature of the air was3 F for the water 267 F A hole having been cut through the ice of such a size as to pre to be 2 feet 96 inches from surface to surface on top of the ice was an estimated average depth of snow of 3 inches of such a density that by weight it was equal to II inches of the ice the total thickness of ice or its equivalent would therefore be 2 feet IO7 inches Of this amount 325 inches were submerged leavingv therefore 22 inches of ice or its equisralent above the waterline Therefore seawaterice floats with one part above the water line and fourteen and eighttenths belosv Expressing the volume of a given quantity of seawater by unity its volume when converted into ice would be I0634 and their

known He was specially interested in the study of ichthyology and for many years after his arrival in Californiav in the intervals of an ex tensive medical practice contributed to this department of natural history by his investigations of and publications upon the fishes of California At the first meeting of the academy of which there is any published record Sept 4 I854 he presented descriptions of two new species Labrgs pzAcAer and XesnBriptergs snarmoracs which still stand though the generic status has been modified noxv Gctr25euAcAra and ScorcrrzcASAys afcgrmorcrtvs His con tributions to the ichthyological knorled ge of the Pacific coast rere frequent for many years especially from I854 as above to the year I863 HiS scientific inquiries sometimes extended though rarely to7ards other forms of animal life He returned to his native State Connecticut about I872 or I873 His services to the cause of science on the Pacific coast in those early days entitle him to grateful remembrance R

presence of the parasite the tuberclebacillus as a pathogenic element This factor is necessary for the production of the disease Second Heredity figures as a prominent element in about thirty per cent of the cases ordinarily met with Third Malhygienic ancl debilitating agents such as foul air sedentary occupations violations of the laws of health and dis eases have a powerful effect by impairing the nutrition in develop ing the disease Heredity and lowered vitality cannot of themselves produce tuberculosis but clinically they play an important role as factors by rendering the individual more vulnerable to bacillary influence FRANK DONALDSON MD Baltimore Md June 29 Volapuk YOUR correspondent  H T P in your issue of the 24th of June asks for information about Volapuk I can refer him to a

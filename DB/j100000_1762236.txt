satisfactory W H LEONARD Montclair NJ Nov 22 Minneapolis Nov i8 CaveAir for Ventilation COL CRUMPS effort to utilize caveair has a personal interest I warm my dwelling with furnaceheat and in place of taking in air through a basement window as is usual I place an intake pipe or tube I use stone pipe under a porch upon the south side of the house which passes under ground eight feet around the building to the north side beneath the cellar wall and below the cellar floor to the furnace  a length of about a hundred feet The size of this pipe should be the same as the chimney This must depend upon the size of the building to be warmed My chimney is eigh teen inches clear space My house contains twelve rooms This chimney is sufficient to ventilate the house and carry off the smoke from the furnace Sometimes it is necessary to build a small fire in the bottom of the chimney where provision is made for such purpose Ventilatingtubes are placed under the floor from the outside corners of the rooms to draw off the cold air on the floor which is constantly being replaced by the warmed air from the ceiling Now the advantage of this improvement in the use of caveair is that in cold weather a modified air comes into the furnace In hot weather using the same apparatus to cool the air before coming into the house the windows should be closed The INDUSTRIAL NOTES Elektron Manufacturing Company A FEW weeks ago fire destroyed the factory of the Elektron Manufacturing Company of Brooklyn whose Perret motors and dynamos were described in Science recently The company at once secured a larger factory at 79 and 8I Washington Street near the bridge equipped it with a complete installation of special tools and machinery and are doing their best to catch up with their orders which had fallen far behind during their enforced idle ness Electrical Accumulators IN the suit of The Electrical Accumulator Company vs The Gibson Electric Company in the United States Circuit Court for the Southern District of New York which was instituted in Febru ary last the complainants have recently moved for a preliminary injunction and Judge Lacombe on Friday last granted the motion and the injunction issued The complainants testimony shows conclusively that the Gibson Company have continuously infringed the Faure patent and that their various modifications are infringe ments

pipe which had been condemned for heavy pressures was being largely used for this purpose Mr Moore also presented a dia gram based on Kutters formula using a value of I7 for n bearing in mind that one inch of rainfall per hour is equivalent to one cubic foot per acre per second In the dis cussion Mr Ferguson described a number of practical points of difficulty he had met with The discussion was also participated in by Messrs J A and W L Seddon M L Holman and A W Hubbard Mr Hol man stated that iron pipe for this purpose was being made as large as six feet in diam eter and ten feet long being lighter and of poorer quality than the pipe used for water service TEN POUNDS THWK OF EEKS II k3 lTHI KOFIT As a Flesh Producer there can be no question but that SCOTT S E MU LSEIO Of Pure Cod Liver

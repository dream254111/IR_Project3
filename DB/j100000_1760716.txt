that the elements of some of the sciences might be taught with ad vantage in the kindergarten It remained for the inventor of this system to show how readily this may be done The expense is a mere trifle and no preparation on the part of the teacher is required We shall soon find our children making marshgas or  ethene dibro mide or showing how nitrate of potassium and sulphuric acid are converted into nitric acid and hydric potassic sulphate we shall hear them making the fine distinction between plain water and crackedup water and we shall be obliged to confess that the method by which we were taught the elements of chemis try was a very cumbersome one as compared with the simple method of Mr Farmer While fully recognizing the humorous fea tures in the kindcergarten system of chemistry we cannot avoid a feeling of depression when we regard it as evidence of a state of mind which is very prevalent Too many teachers of chemistry like Mr Farmer magnify the importance of formulas and lose sight of the facts which they represent This is the crying evil in chemical instruction at the present time The teacher who knows the theory but doesnt  know the practical side of the sub ject is still abroad in the land FONTAINES OLDEIR MESOZOIC FLORA OF VIRGINIA TinI work is one of the smallest of this series but it is one of merit and importance Although the number of fossil plants from Vir ginia strata here enumerated is not great they are so thoroughly illustrated and so critically discussed that their diagnostic value is fully brought out Professor Fontaine may fairly claim to have demonstrated fiom evidence fur nished by the plants alone that these older mesozoic beds which had not previously been clearly distinguished from the younger ones and had been commonly grouped with the lat ter as the trias of Virginia can scarcely extend so low as the extreme upper trias and conform more closely to the rhaetic of Franconia Bay reuth and Palsj6 or even to the lias of Rajma hal This conclusion of course is derived from Contributions to the knowledge of the older mesozoic flora of Virginia By WILLIAIM AORRIS FONTAINE Washington Government 1883 12  144 p 54 pl Monographs of the U S geological survey vi N IVG  VOL V No 113 an analysis of the species discovered and a study of their affinities with species obtained from strata in other parts of the world whose geological position is fixed with some degree of accuracy This subject is discussed at length The substance of it can be given in a few words The whole number of distinct plants de scribed is fortyfive Eight of these were already known from other localities under es tablished names four more of this class are referred to different genera or species mak ing twelve not confined to Virginia Of the remaining thirtythree which are so confined nine have close affinities with species already described It thus appears that considerably over half of the entire number are peculiar to the locality and have no weight in determin ing its horizon The decision must therefore turn entirely upon the twentyone species which are either themselves found outside of Virginia or are nearly allied to such as are so found The author has made some errors in his table of distribution such as the omission of Schizo neura planicostata which he describes in the text and the failure to assign Ctenophllum Braunianum to its proper horizon rhaetic These corrections made we find that while only one of the species Asterocarpus platy rachis has its nearest affinity with an exclu sively triassic plant and only seven have their nearest affinities with exclusively Jurassic plants there are ten which have either been found in the rhaetic only or are most closely allied to such as have only been so found Thus thirteen species or about fiveeighths may be classed as rhaetic plants and only four or less than onefifth can at best be set down as triassic The seven Jurassic species are mostly from the lias or lower oolite which while not negativing the rhaetic character of the Virginia beds does seem when coupled with the rest of the evidence to negative their triassic character We have not space to go further into details and will merely add that while our analysis of his facts differs slightly from that made by Professor Fontaine the conclusion which flows fIrom it is the same viz that in so far as fos sil plants can be depended upon to correlate the deposits of different parts of the world those of the Richmond coalfields point to the rhaetic of Europe as the age to which they must be referred It is something to have even thus far fixed the geological position of this hitherto unset tled formation but those who are specially interested in the progress which is taking place I r ISCIENCE in vegetable paleontology will perhaps regard as still more important the discovery and care ful characterization of the twentyeight forms which the author describes as wholly new to science twentysix of which receive the rank of species and for the satisfactory classifica tion of which he has found himself obliged to create the two new extinct genera Merten sides and Pseudodanaeopsis Of these twenty six new species eight are allied more or less closely to known forms leaving eighteen spe cies so distinct that the author has been un able to compare them with any thing that has been hitherto described This is remarkable in view of the great uniformity which is gen erally found to exist in the floras of the earlier geological formations at points the most widely separated geographically It seems to indi cate an unexpected divergence of the meso zoic flora of North America from that of Europe and other districts of the eastern hemisphere An important feature of the work not indi cated by its title is a careful revision by Pro fessor Fontaine of the researches in the same line of Dr Ebenezer Emrnons in North Caro lina made some thirty years ago and pub lished in part vi of his American geology 1857 The fossil plants found by Dr Em mons and figured in this work are described under the head of  Fossils of the trias  but Professor Fontaine thinks he has conclusively shown from a study of his figures and descrip tions the fossils themselves having been de stroyed during the war that this trias of Emmons in North Carolina is identical with lis  older mesozoic of Virginia The work is copiously illustrated there be ing in all fiftyfour plates the last six or seven of which are devoted to the reproduction of the figures of Emmons The photoengraving process is employed and we have here a stand ard from which to judge of its applicability to the illustration of fossil plants In some re spects it proves quite satisfactory at least when we consider its cheapness and the ad vantage it thus furnishes of allowing at mod erate cost the ample illustration of species which is so great a necessity in this branch of paleontology But we do not think the most has been made of the process in the present work The index which is otherwise good con tains one feature which cannot be too highly commended to authors of such works This is the reference to plate and figure as well as to page which in more than half the cases saves the reader the labor of looking twice 281 ANNALS OF THE NAVAL OBSERVA TORY DURING the period covered by the observa tions contained in these two volumes the naval observatory was under the superintend ency of the late RearAdmiral Rodgers His general reports to the chief of the Bureau of navigation on the work of the institution were promptly issued in the latter part of the years to which they refer and are reprinted as customarily in the annual volumes Pursuant to its policy inaugurated some five years ago of reducing the size of its bulky publications  a policy which has met with universal commendation  the observatory might now go farther and expunge a good fraction of the protracted and annually reit erated introduction to the observations with the transitcircle We seriously question whether disastrous ambiguity would ensue if we were not told with every year that the ridge of the roof covering the transitcircle extends east and west and that the hole in the cube of the axis of the instrument is 23 inches in diameterto say nothing of the continued reprint of formulae and details of reduction which every astronomer who has occasion to consult the volume keeps con stantly in mind This introduction now occu pies about onefourth of the entire volume including observations with all the instruments of the establishment and the several appen dixes We suspect however that the only sufficient remedy lies not in excerption but in rewriting ab initio on the supposition that those who will read the introduction already know something The newly adopted form in which the obser vations with the transitcircle are published seems to have been very carefully studied and is in every way a model We should like to be able to write as strongly of the precision of the results of stellar and planetary observations with this instrument the character of which is too well known to require characterization here Presumably no one is responsible for the fact that they are not better but certainly the fre quent change of observers unavoidable in so far as the observatory itself is concerned is not conducive to results of a high order of accuracy During the years 1879 and 1880 tile transit circle was under the charge of Professor Eastman and was employed with customary

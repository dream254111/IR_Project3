white clockhand revolv ing rapidly in front of a black face1 The chief difficulty in this case is to maintain a uniform rota tion at high speed To avoid this difficulty and to determine the uniformity of exposure of any par ticular shutter under apparently like circumstances the followning method has been suggested In carry ing out the experiment in practice I have had the assistance of Mr J O Ellinger A tuningfork B with a mirror attached to the side of one of the prongs is placed in front of the camera lens This mirror is so arranged as to reflect into the camera C a horizontal beam of sunlight which before reaching the fork has passed through a halfinch liole in a screen S placed about ten feet distant This produces on the groundglass a minute brilliant point of light If the fork be set vibrating the point will become a short fine horizontal line if the fork be rotated about its longitudinal axis the line will be come a sinusoidal curve described on the circum ference of a circle of long radius A photographic plate is now inserted and the dropshutter attached On releasing the latter it will be found that a portion of the sinusoid has been photographed and the pre cise exposure may be determined by counting the number of vibrations represented on the plate The mirror employed should be somewhat larger than the lens to be measured so as to cover its edges during the whole exposure The mirror may be glued directly to the prong ol the fork with strong carpen ters glue after first scraping off a little of the silver ing at the edges of the glass The rate of the fork is then determrined by comparison with a standard fork by the method of beats W H PICKEIjNCG Photographic laboratory Mass inst of technology 1 For other nmethod see Brit outrn photogrphi Aug 31 1883 and May 23 1884 VOL 1V No 93 THE IMPORTANCE OF CHEMISTRY IN BIOLOGY AND AMEDICINE Tr1E position of chemistry in tlle biological sciences has long been in Englishspeaking communities a very indefinite one in fact it may be questioned whether the science has even at the present day alny generally recog nized position among biologists themselves That this has been the case for many years even in Europe is evident firom the fact that until recently the published results of investi gation in the field of physiological chemistry have had to be sought for in widely diverse places Many papers have been published in purely chemical journals others in journals devoted to physiology while still others have appeared in socalled  naturalhistory jour nals a fact which in itself plainly indicates the past status of this branch of science There can be no question that physiological chemistry should occupy a definite place among the biological sciences Biology is confessedly a study of life and as suich has to do with the development structure and function of living organisms The first two of these we suppose to be included under the heads of embryology and morphology  while the third constituting in the words of Herbert Spencer  the second main division of biology embracing the finc tional phenomena of organisms is that which is in part signified by physiology Further that part of physiology which is concerned with the molecular changes going on in organ isms is known as organic chemistry or with equal propriety as physiological chemistry hence a study of the fiinctions of the body to be at all complete must include a study of the chemical chchanges incident to life and cannot be restricted to the purely physical phenoimena of the organism Yet it is very noticeable that wherever  biology  is taught in this country even in the most liberally con ducted institutions wllere the course of study embraces embryology animal and vegetable morphology experimental physiology etc physiological chemistry is rarely mentioned P We ineed to inquire whether this is due to aNovEMinE 14 18841 SCIE lack of appreciation of the importance of the subject or whether it is generally considered as outside the pale of biological inquiries We are more inclined to believe that the rapid development of the past twenty years in the various branches of biology so divergent from chemistry has tended to push into the back ground the chemical phenomena of life to such an extent that tihe existence of chemical science as a part of biology is in danger of being forgotten Physiology in its entirety dealing with all the fulnctions of the living organism both ani mal and vegetable is truly a broad subject but that by itself does not constitute a suffi cient reason why the chemical composition and chemical processes of the organism should be so seldom studied By this it is not meant that all applications of chemistry to physiology arle overlooked or that there is an utter lack of appreciation of its importance but rather that the average instruction in physiology in this country and apparently likewise in Eng land lisregards almost every thing pertaining to chemistry aside from the common funda mental facts  so that whether as a part of physiology or as physiological chemistry the average student in biology acquires but little knowledge of the chemical processes of the animal organism by I knowledge being meant that personal knowledge which in the case of an experimental science can be obtained only in a properly equipped laboratory But while in America little has been done either to advance or to teach the chemical side of physiology in Europe it has been very dif ferent until now as a growing science follow ing a natural law of progressive division of labor and of thought the chemical phenomena of the living body have massed themselves together and aided by increased interest and added workers a division of physiology has become necessary and today there exists in Germany at least a new science or rather a specialized portion of an old one viz that of physiological chemistry We would lay all possible stress on the im portant position of physiological chemistry in NCE 455 Germany its relation to medicine and biology in general the large number of important re searches emanating from her laboratories and on all that tends to make the science so pro gressive in that country  and then by con trast how small and insignificant appears the little work done in our own country  If we look to the biological laboratories of our col leges to our medical schools and to the labora tories connected with our hospitals we find an almost utter lack of work tended to increase the boundaries of the science Seldom do we hear of a piece of original work in physio logical chemistry  and few American names are being added to that long list of Germian investigators whose united work has made the science what it is today There is also a practical side to this ques tion Not every medical student it is true can become proficient in physiological chemnis try there is not time foi it but many a man gifted with powers of observation and en dowed with a love of knowledge may find much to do of direct practical value to medical science Every student of medicine should however possess some knowledge of physio logical chemistry Dr Perkin in his recent address before the Chemical society of Eng land at its anniversary meeting says  If there is any value in chemical products as curative agents if there is any value in physiological chemistry or any importance in toxicology surely medical students should have a sound knowledge of chemical science and not simply learn to detect an acid and a base in a mixture  an operation which is of no value except as an intermediate exercise to be followed by more advanced work What is needed in this country is a fuller appreciation of the importance of physiological chemistry both in biology and in the science of medicine A host of questions are to be answered regarding digestion nutrition respi ration etc  questions to be answered only through the agency of chemical science and if America is to do her share in the clearing up of the mysteries surrounding the chemical processes of the living organism physiological456 45fi SCIENCE chemistry must be raised to a higher plane among the biological sciences THE NAVIGATION OF THE NILE THE Nile which during thousands of years has attracted much attention from the intel ligent portion of mankind yet remains in many respects the most interesting of the great rivers of the globe Its sources which for so long a time were a mystery have within the last quarter of a century been rediscovered  but that rediscovery has only rendered it more interesting and more worthy of study The great fluctuations in its flow and the remarkable almost mathematical regularity year after year of these fluctuations can now be practically studied and their causes clearly understood Having its great first reservoir under the equator we now know that it derives its waters from the region between a few degrees south of that line and latitude about 13 north It receives its last affluent the Atbara south of latitude 13 north and yet continues its flow notwithstanding evaporation receiving nothing and giving life to the lands it traverses until it pours the waters of south central Africa into the Mediterranean Sea in latitude 32 north carrying in those waters each year masses of the debris of the mountains of the interior to continually fertilize and extend its delta Early in June of each year the flow is the least The current near Cairo has then a rapidity of only a little more than one mile per hour and the amount of water passing is only from four hundred to five hundred cubic yards per second Before the end of June the annual rise commences and by the end of September the rapidity of the current reaches nearly if not quite three and a half miles per hour the quantity of water passing a given point be coming from nine thousand to ten thousand cubic yards per second Late in October or early in November it commences a somewhat rapid decline which continues until January when the decline be comes more gradual and regular this gradual decline continuing until about the end of May when the minimum flow is again reached to give place the following month to the new annual rise The great regularity of the fluctuations is due to the peculiar sources of supply and the admirable system of reservoirs and checks which nature has there provided VoL IV No 93 The Egyptian Nile is formed by the junction at Khartum of the Blue Nile and White Nile The Blue Nile BahrelAzrack taking its rise in the centre of Abyssinia and fed by the rains which yearly fall in the mountains of that country during the months of April May June July and August furnishes the great masses of water which cause the rapid summer rise and also furnishes the rich silt which torn from the mountains of Abyssinia spreads over the cultivatable lands of Egypt and yearly renews the fertility of those lands The White Nile BahrelAbiad flowingo from the great reservoir under the equator guarded in that and the subordinate reservoirs Lake Ibrahim and Lake Albert and guarded also by the great system of dams called  the cataracts furnishes the steady flow of clear water which continues throughout the year No human engineer has ever devised on any thing like so grand a scale so admirable a system for the collection preservation and distribution of irrigatingo waters as has there been formed by nature for the supply of Egypt Lake Victoria with a surface of some forty thousand square miles collects and stores foi the use of the Sudan and Egypt the rain water falling on a basin of more than a hundred and sixty thousand square miles of surface The average yearly rise of the lake may be fairly taken according to observations made on the spot as two feet which gives for distribution through its only outlet the Victoria Nile the Somerset of Speke the enormous volume of more than sixtyeight thousand mil lion cubic yards of water per annum or more than two thousand cubic yards per second It will be seen that this storage is so well devised that in order to give one inch of rise to the Victoria Nile more than twentyeight hundred mnillions of cubic yards must be stored in this great reservoir Then come the two secondary reservoirs first Lake Ibrahim discovered by Col Long in 1874 in latitude north 1 which must be filled before the flow can continue on towards Egypt and then Lake Albert which must be filled over its surface of perhaps three thou sand square miles before the direct distribution of waters through the White Nile can fairly commence But this is not all that nature has there done to regularize the great distribution Between Lakes Ibrahim and Albert there is a great system of natural dacms in the cataracts which are found between Foweira and Lake Albert Then coining north down the White Nile we find first at Duffli and soon again at Beddin successions of rapids the results

OfficerCode 1904  723 requires a justice to pay over fines within 30 days after collecting the same and imposes a penalty for his failure so to do Section 3717 makes it a criminal offense for any state or municipal officer having custody of public funds to knowingly misuse or misappropriate the same Held that where a justice of the peace imposes and collects a fine and not only fails to pay the same over but feloniously misuses and misap propriates the same he is indictable under section 3717 2 JuryDisqualification of JurorsExpressions as to GuiltThat a juror has stated in effect that he would convict defendant if he sat on any jury which tried him does not disqualify the juror where the statement was made with reference to a previous indictment against defendant preferred by a grand jury of which the juror was a mem ber but which was not connected with the indictment on the trial of which the juror was examined and the juror further stated that he could give defendant a fair and impartial trial without reference to what he had heard on the grand jury or otherwise Ed NoteFor cases in point see vol 31 Cent Dig Jury  440 461 3 EmbezzlementBy Public OfficerEvidencePractice in

F S Collier for plaintiff in error The Attorney General Wnm A Anderson and Ashby  Read for the Commonwealth KEITH P An indictment was found in the circuit court of Warwick county against Charles H Robinson which charges that he being a justice of the peace of Newport magisterial dis trict in said county by virtue of his office aforesaid had the custody of a certain sum of money public funds of the state of Virginia to wit the sum of 5 which he was required by law to pay to the clerk of the circuit court of the county aforesaid and which he feloniously and knowingly did misuse and misappro priate    and did then and there feloniously and know ingly dispose of the said money and public funds otherwise than by paying the same to the clerk of the circuit court of Warwick county Virginia in accordance with law and so the jurors aforesaid upon their oath aforesaid do say that the said Charles H Robinson then and there in manner and form aforesaid feloniously and knowingly did steal take embezzle and carry away the said money and public funds aforesaid to wit the sum of five dollars currency of the United States of the value of five dollars the money and public funds of the state of Vir ginia Against the peace and dignity of the commonwealth of Virginia There was a motion to quash and a demurrer interposed to this indictment We deem it necessary to consider only the de murrer The plaintiff in error contends that the indictment is based upon section 723 of the Code of 1904 which provides 1906 4312 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER If any fine is received by the justice imposing it he shall pay the same with the cost within thirty days thereafter to the clerk of the circuit court of his county or corporation court of his city For failure to make such payment within said time without good cause he shall forfeit twenty dollars which to gether with the money so received may be recovered by motion This statute fixes the duty of the justice When he imposes and collects the fine he must by its terms pay the same together with the costs within 30 days to the clerk of the court of his county or corporation and for failure to make such payment he forfeits 20 which may be recovered from him by motion to gether with the money so received But that is not the offense with which plaintiff in error was charged He was prosecuted under section 3717 which is as follows If any officer agent or employee of the state or of the city tcwn or county or the deputy of any such officer having custody of public funds knowingly misuse or misappropriate the same or knowingly dispose thereof otherwise than in accordance with law he shall be confined in the penitentiary not less than one nor more than ten years and if any default of such officer agent employee or deputy in paying over said funds to the proper authorities when required by law to do so shall be deemed prima facie evidence of his guilt The two sections are wholly dissimilar The first refers to the failure to pay over the second to the knowing misuse or mis appropliation of the funds of the state It is true that the de tention of the money is one of the elements constituting the offense punished under section 3717 but it does not constitute the offense itself for money may be detained without being mis appropriated which is the evil for which section 723 was de signed as a remedy But it may also be detained with fraudulent and felonious intent to misuse and misappropriate which brings the case within the terms of section 3717 We are of opinion that the indictment is sufficient and that the demurrer was properly overruled While the jury were being selected for the trial of this case plaintiff in error challenged one of the veniremen who had been sworn upon his voir dire and asked him if he had not at a time and place named in the question said Charley Robinson dont want me to sit on any jury that tries him and would know that he is a goner if I sit on any jury that tries him To which the juror replied that he had made such a statement and meant that if the evidence was as strong in this case as it was in the one before the grand jury on which he sat when Robinson was indicted on a former occasion he would convict him The grand jury here alluded to was not connected at all with this prosecution The court then asked the juror if there was any May 44ROBINSON V COMMONWEALTH impression on his mind made by what he had heard about the accused or by what he had heard on the grand jury in the case referred to that would require evidence to remove it to which he replied that there was not but that he could give the accused a fair and impartial trial without reference to what he had heard about the accused either on the grand jury or otherwise There upon the juror was received by the court and the plaintiff in error excepted This subject was recently considered by this court in the case of McCue v Commonwealth 103 Va 870 49 S E 623 and the conclusions reached are thus stated in the syllabus The trend of recent decisions is in the direction of limiting rather than extending the disqualification of jurors by reason of mere opin ion hence the courts inquire into the character of that opinion If it is a decided or substantial opinion as to the guilt or inno cence of the accused no matter upon what ground formed the juror is incompetent but if the opinion is merely hypothetical and the court is satisfied from an examination of the juror on his voir dire or otherwise that he is not biased or prejudiced and that he can give the prisoner a fair and impartial trial ac cording to the law and the evidence he should be accepted No fixed and invariable rule can be laid down whereby to test the competency of jurors but each case should be determined by its own facts and circumstances and great weight should be at tached by an appellate court to the opinion of the trial judge Applying this principle to the case before us we are of opin ion that there was no error in the ruling of the circuit court The third assignment of error is to the exclusion of certain evidence offered by the accused The bill of exceptions is as follows That at the trialof this cause after the accused had been arraignedand the jury im paneled to try the issue and while the accused was testifying in his behalf relative to the reasons why he had not paid the fine and the costs shown in the evidence to the clerk of the court he started to state that it was his practice and that of other magistrates and police officers down there To further testimony along this line the commonwealth here objected by counsel which objection the court sustained to which ruling and opinion of the court in sustaining the said objection the accused by his counsel excepted and tenders this bill of exception which he prays may be signed etc If the prisoners conduct was in accordance with the law it did not need to be supported by the practice of others If it was not in accordance with the law the fact that others violated the law would furnish no justification or excuse to him We see no merit in this assignment of error 1906 4512 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER After the evidence was introduced the court at the instance of the commonwealth gave the jury two instructions The first instruction is as follows The court instructs the jury that a payment made to the clerk 30 days after the receipt by a justice of public funds does not excuse a crime if any committed because of the failure of an earlier payment If the crime was complete if the prisoner had knowingly mis used or misappropriated the funds of the state his subsequent restitution of the fruits of his crime could not relate back so as to efface the wrong The second instruction is that the law requires that a justice of the peace within 30 days after the receipt of any fine imposed by him do pay such fine with the cost to the clerk of the cir cuit court of his county and if the jury shall believe from the evidence that C H Robinson while a justice of the peace for this county received a fine of 5 of Charlie Sacriensce imposed by him as such justice and instead of paying the same within 30 days after such receipt by him Robinson to Mr Burnham clerk knowingly misused or misappropriated the same or know ingly disposed thereof otherwise than in accordance with the law it is the duty of the jury to find him guilty and to fix his confinement in the penitentiary at not less than 1 nor more than 10 years This instruction raises again the question considered with re spect to the demurrer to the indictment It is a correct state ment of the law as set out in sections 723 and 3717 in the first of which it is made the duty of officers to pay over the fine within 30 days after its receipt and in the last of which the knowing misuse or misappropriation of public funds is made a felony punishable by confinement in the penitentiary for not less than 1 nor more than 10 years The plaintiff in error offered certain instructions numbered 1 2 3 4 and 5 the second of which was given without objec tion The fourth as offered is in the following words The court instructs the jury that unless they believe from the evidence that the accused knowingly misused or misappro priated or knowingly disposed of otherwise than in accordance with law a fine of 5 collected by him as justice of the peace of Newport magisterial district in the county of Warwick which 5 were funds of the state of Virginia as alleged in the indict ment then they must find him not guilty The court struck out the words Newport magisterial district in and to this action plaintiff in error excepted It is true that the words stricken from this instruction are found in the indictment but they were not material may be re May 46ROBINSON V COMMONWEALTH garded as surplusage and their rejection was not harmful To bring the crime within the jurisdiction of the court it is only necessary to show the county in which it occurred that county being one over which the court has jurisdiction Instructions 1 3 and 5 were refused Instruction No 1 made the guilt of the accused to depend upon his having misappropriated the full amount of 5 and would have required an acquittal although the evidence had shown the misappropriation of a part of it The third instruction directed the jury to acquit unless they found from the evidence that the accused was a justice of the peace for Newport magisterial district in the county of War wick on the 15th day of August 1904 as alleged in the indict ment and presents the question already considered in disposing of the modification of instruction No 4 The fifth instruction is as follows The court instructs the jury that before they can find the accused guilty of the charge alleged in the indictment they must believe that he knowingly feloniously and with an intent to defraud the state of Virginia misued misappropriated or disposed of otherwise than in ac cordance with law the 5 or funds of the state of Virginia as in the indictment alleged In legal effect the instruction as offered by plaintiff in error is the equivalent of that given by the court in which the jury were told that to constitute the crime with which the plaintiff in error was charged they must believe from the evidence that he while a justice of the peace of Warwick county had know ingly misused or misappropriated a fine imposed by him as such justice The next assignment of error is that the attorney for the commonwealth in the course of his argument before the jury used the following language That if the accused knowingly disposed of the fine or any part of the same like keeping it and putting it in bank otherwise than by paying it to the clerk of the court within 30 days it is a violation of the law and the accused should be convicted as charged in the indictmentto which the accused by counsel objected which objection the court being of the opinion that the accused was not prejudiced by the words objected to they being simply a detached part of the argument overruled to which ruling of the court the ac cused by counsel excepted As we have said in discussing another branch of the case the detention of the money is a part and a necessary part of its mis appropriation Detention does not necessarily constitute mis appropriation but there could be no misuse or misappropriation without detention though it is true that detention that continues 1906 4712 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER for 30 days standing alone would not complete the offense under section 3717 We have found that the jury was properly directed by the court and we cannot think that in the face of proper instructions the jury could have been misled to the prej udice of the prisoner by a remark made by the prosecuting at torney which the court certifies was a detached part of the argument That is to say we are asked to reverse the judgment of the court because a sentence separated and segregated from its context is an incorrect statement of the law when the court which heard the whole address of counsel and was in a position to consider it not in its disjointed parts but as a whole certifies to us that the accused was not prejudiced by the language used We are of opinion that this assignment of error should be over ruled The last assignment of error is to the refusal of the court to set aside the verdict as being contrary to the evidence and in arrest of judgment The facts show that the plaintiff in error was a justice of the peace for Warwick county that he issued a warrant charging Charles Sacriensce with a misdemeanor that on August 15 1904 he entered judgment of conviction that the fine imposed was 5 and that this fine had been paid to him in his capacity as a justice of the peace These facts appear from the testimony of the clerk of the circuit court of Warwick county and the report sheet furnished him by the accused Plaintiff in error who was sworn in his own behalf testifies that on Sunday the 14th of Au gust Charles Sacriensce was arrested on a warrant issued by him and brought to the station house where he bailed him charging him 60 cents for it that the accused put up 5 collateral for his ap pearance the next day that he did not appear the next day and witness had never seen or heard of him since that witness took from the 5 the fees of the constable amounting to 170 and his own fees amounting to 1 the clerks fees of 125 and the 105 due the state and that he afterwards wrote up a mittimus for the man and credited upon the back of the mittimus the 5 collateral and that he deposited in bank the 105 due the state and the 125 due the clerk He then tendered the 105 due the state and stated that he was ready to pay to the clerk any thing more due the state by him He stated that he had always intended to pay what he had of this fine to the clerk and certainly would not have made a report of it if he had intended to steal it that he knew better than that that he wanted to collect the bal ance of the fine but Charlie Sacriensce never was found that he never did try and convict the defendant and that his report was wrong in showing that he fined him 5 At this point in the examination of Robinson the attorney for the commonwealth May 48ROBINSON V COMMONWEALTH handed him a warrant which was in the following words and figures Whereas John A Williamson acting chief of police of the said county has this day made complaint and information on oath before me C H Robinson a justice of the peace of the said county that Charlie Sacriensce of the said county on the 14th day of August 1904 in the said county did unlawfully create a nuisance by indecently exposing his person by bathing in a nude condition in the James river between Dawson City and Klondike of said county in the presence of divers persons both ladies and gentlemen against the statutes made and provided in such cases These are therefore in the name of the commonwealth to command you forthwith to apprehend and bring before me a justice of the peace of said county the body of the said Charlie Sacriensce to answer to said complaint and to be further dealt with according to law Given under my hand and seal this 14th day of August in the year 1904 C H Robinson J P Indorsed Commonwealth v Charlie Sacriensce Warrant of arrest Executed this 14th August 1904 by John A Williamson After hearing the evidence in the case the defendant Charlie Sacriensce was found guilty as charged in the warrant and his punishment ascertained to pay a fine of 500 and pay costs of the prosecution Costs 395 This the 15th day of August 1904 C H Robinson J P After showing these papers to the witness the attorney for the commonwealth then said to him You said you did not try or fine this man and this warrant and indorsement thereon show differently How do you account for that And the witness replied I did not mean to say I did not fine him I said he was not found That he was tried in his absence and a mittimus was issued for him but he was never found The witness further said that the warrant was his warrant and he entered the judgment on the back of it that he had fined Sacriensce 5 and 395 as costs as appeared on the warrant Upon this evidence after being instructed as we have seen the jury returned a verdict finding the plaintiff in error guilty as charged in the indictment and fixing his punishment at one year 4 1906 4912 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER in the penitentiary Upon that verdict the circuit court overruled a motion for a new trial and in arrest of judgment sentenced the prisoner and we are of opinion that the record discloses no error The judgment is affirmed Note EmbezzlementConstruction of StatuteA statute defining a crime or offense such as embezzlement can not be extended by construc tion to persons or things not within its descriptive terms though they appear to be within reason and spirit of the statute State v Meyers 56 0 St 340 47 N E 138 JurorsDisqualificationThe early Virginia cases dealing with the disqualification of jurors on the ground of an expression of opinion as to the guilt of the accused seem to announce the rule as laid down in McCue v Com 103 Va 870 49 S E 623 see Wright v Com 32 Gratt 941 and note See also monographic note on Juries ap pended to Chahoon v Com 20 Gratt 733 In Bolln v State 51 Nebr 581 71 N W 444 which was a prosecu tion upon an information filed by the county attorney charging a plublic officer with embezzlement of public money it was held that an opinion formed by a juror does not affect his competency or afford cause for challenge unless it is unqualified as to the guilt or inno cence of the accused of the offense charged This case seems to be on all fours with the case under discussion Usage or Custom as Defense to CrimeA custom or usage repug nant to the commands of a statute will not prevail against such stat ute Bolln v State 51 Nebr 581 71 N W 444 In Bolln v State 51 Nebr 58i 71 N W 444 an information was filed against a city treasurer charging him with embezzlement of public moneys for disbursing public funds in a manner forbidden by the statute the court said When the defendant turned over his office to his successor Mr Dumont there were in the cash drawer carried as cash slips and memorandum checks aggregating about 24000 representing that amount of public funds which he had paid out to and which were carried as charges against various persons mostly city employees and contractors with the city The defendant offered to show that it had been the custom of the various city treas urers who had preceded the defendant in office to so pay out ctiy funds The offer was rejected and such ruling is assigned as error The fact if it be a fact that the money represented by said slips and checks in the cash drawer was paid out in pursuance of a custom with the knowledge of the city authorities did not make the trans action in question lawful The disbursement of public funds in that manner was in violation of law a practice in the highest degree repre hensible and constituted embezzlement notwithstanding the trans action was openly done with knowledge of the entire city govern ment and might be sanctioned by a custom or usage as old as the Mosaic law On an indictment for indecent exposure of the person while bath ing in a public place the custom of others long acquiesced in to so conduct themselves was held no defense Reg v Reed 12 Cox C C 1 Arguments of CounselIt is well settled that the prejudicial effect May 501906 ROBINSON V COMMONWEALTH 51 of improper arguments of counsel may be averted and

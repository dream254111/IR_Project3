remote If X is alive at the time of the testators death then the only thing to happen is her reaching twentyfour and as that must happen if at all in her life time and she is alive at the testators death the gift to her cannot be too remote Let us now look at the case as it really arose a gift under an exclu sive power to G to appoint among his children and an appointment by his will of independent sums to those of his daughters who should reach twentyfour the daughters being some more and some less than three years at the time of his death Of course the daughters under three could not take could those more than three years old take As the gifts are separable the fact that there were or might be other daughters who could not take would not invalidate the gifts to those who were over three years of age But were those gifts in themselves good  If to use the common phrase the words of the appointment are read into the instrument creating the power then we shall have the case we have just been considering and the legacy to the daughters would be bad except to those living when the power was created This phrase however is not in all respects correct The word daughters  should have given to it the meaning which the donee gave to it that is of certain individual girls having in fact certain names and certain ages eg A who is six years old B who is five years old C who is four years old D who is two years old But it must be ob served that the being of these ages is not a condition which the donee has attached to the appointments As the intention of the donee was to appoint to particular persons those persons names may be read into the creating instrument but the qualities of those persons cannot be read into the creating instrument as conditions for the gift unless the donee has made them so Therefore if we call an appointee unborn at the time of the creation of the power X it was not then certain that the gift to X in the case we are considering might not take effect beyond the required limits If the appointment had been to such of the donees daughters as should be three years old at his death upon their reaching twentyfour the gift would have been good because at the creation of the power no legatee answering the required description could possibly take at too remote a time Wilkinson v Duncan therefore would seem to be wrong and also a fortiori Von Brockdorff v Malcolm 30 Ch D I72 which pro fesses to rest upon it and the attempt in the Addendum Gray Perp p xxxiii to support the latter case fails RECENT CASES These cases are selected from the

STATUTORY LIABILITY OF OWNER  A steampropeller was wrecked and abandoned to the underwriters as a total loss It was subsequently taken in tow by a wreckingmaster but sank within twentyfour hours and

the contract although originating from it Chicago St L  P RR Co v Graham 29 N E Rep 170 Ind CONFLICT OF LAWS BILLS OF EXCHANGE  PAROL ACCEPTANCE  An agreement made in Missouri by a resident of Illinois to accept and pay drafts at his place of business in Illinois is governed by the law of the latter State to the exclusion of the Missouri statutes And in Illinois such a parol promise is bind

and interest to be paid at a designated bankinghouse in London are sued on It appears that the holder has for several years after maturity accepted interest at the English rate The question is whether interest after maturity is to be paid at the rate paid in England or in South Carolina Held that the Eng lish rate is to be paid The form of the bond raises such a presumption which is made conclusive by the receipt of that rate for several years Coghlan v So Car R Co 12 Sup Ct Rep 150 CONSTITUTIONAL LAW EMINENT DOMAIN  GRADE CROSSINGS  Where a railroad corporation formed under the general railroad law locates its route so that its line crosses the route of another railroad the law gives it the right to decide for itself whether it will cross such other road at grade or otherwise The only limitation upon this right is that it shall not unduly impair either the safety or the reasonably fair enjoyment of the road whose route is crossed yersey City N  W Ry Co v CentralRR Co 22 Atl Rep 728 N J CONSTITUTIONAL LAW  INTERSTATE COMMERCE  STATE TAXES  A Maine statute requires every railroad corporation in the State to pay  an annual excise tax for the privilege of exercising its franchises the amount of the tax to be determined according to a sliding scale proportioned to the average gross earn ings per mile within the State for the year preceding the levy of the tax Held that the method of determining the amount of the tax is merely a way of ascer taining the value of the privilege and does not render the tax a tax upon the receipts themselves and hence in its application to railroads which enter the State from another State or Canada the act does not operate as a regulation of interstate or foreign commerce  Bradlev Harlan Lamar and Brown JJ dis senting Slate of Maine v

upholding a statute which by changing the terms of a contract between a city and a water works company im paired the obligation thereof within the prohibition of the federal Constitution when it appears that the contract claimed to have been impaired was ultra vires and void and had been so declared by the State court City of New Orleans v NVew 0 leans IWaerworks Co 12 Sup Ct Rep 142 CONSTITUTIONAL LAW  TAKING PROPERTY FOR PUBLIC PURPOSE  A statute which provides that land may be flowed for the purpose of fish culture is constitutional as the taking of private property is for a public purpose And a ponl maintained for the culture of useful fish though maintained only for the pr fit and benefit of the owner is within the purposes of the act Turner v Nye 28 N E Rep 1048 Mass CONSTITUTIONAL LAW  WEAVERS FINES ACT UNCONSTITUTIONAL The Weavers Fines Act passed by the Massachusetts Legislature of 1891 declaring that  No employer shall impose a fine upon or withhold the wages or any part of the wages of an employd engaged at weaving for imperfections that may arise during the process of weaving is unconstitutional as interfering with the inalienable right of  acquiring possessing and protecting property guaranteed by the State Constitution by restricting the necessarily incidental right to make reasonable contracts and as impairing the obligation of contracts within the meaning of the federal Constitution Holmes J dissents Com v Perry 28 N E Rep 1 126 Mass See note on this case 5 Harvard Law Review 287 CONTRACT  INSURANCE  CANCELIATION  WHEN TAKING EFFECT  By a New York statute it is obligatory upon fire insurance companies to cancel any policy issued by them at the request of the insured Plaintiff who held a policy from defendant wishing to cancel it mailed

which contains no specified limit of time for unloading is to unload within a reasonable time after the arrival of the ship at the port of discharge and the reasonableness of the time is to be measured by the circumstances existing at the time of the unloading Held accordingly that a consignee of cargo under a bill of lading who through no act or default of his own but owing entirely to a strike of laborers at the port of discharge did not unload for nearly one month after the ships arrival was not liable to the shipowner for damages for detention of the ship Hick v Rodocanachi 40 W R 16I Ct of Appeal By terms of a charterparty in which the port of discharge was specified the cargo was to be discharged with all despatch as customary Hteld that the effect of the charterparty was to

DOUBT  Under the defence of an alibi it is sufficient if there is enough evidence to produce a reasonable doubt as to the presence of the prisoner at the killing Adams v State o1 So Rep o16 Fla  A

of the leading case of McCord v People 46 N Y 470 The New York rule is followed in Wisconsin State v Crowle 41 Wisc 271 On the other side and in accord with the Colorado case are the leading cases of Corn v Morrill 8 Cush 57I and Corn v Henry 22 Pa St 253 EQUITY  INJUNCTION  RESTRAINING ACTION AT LAW  A agreed to build a piece of road for 29000 with the right to retain possession thereof and run it for his own benefit until that sum was paid After completing the road and be fore receiving full payment he was forcibly dispossessed by the officers of the rail road company and brought an action of forcible entry and detainer in the District Court Pending this action he entered into a written stipulation with the company that the sum due under the contract was 25000 Judgment was rendered in his favor Seven months later the companys successor tendered A 25000 with interest to date which A refused This bill is to enjoin A from taking possession under his judgment Held that the agreement

SETTING ASIDE CONVEYANCE  INSANITY  MARRIAGE  De fendant by fraud and undue influence obtained from plaintiff an insane person conveyances and transfers of all his property and the next day she persuaded plaintiff to go through the form of marriage with her Held that a bill would lie by plaintiff through his guardian to avoid such conveyances and transfers although proceedings which had been

A traction engine to which the name and address of the owner were affixed was let on hire by the owner for three months Owing to the negligence of the hirer while driving it along the highway the plaintiff who was in a carriage was injured Held that the owner was not liable Lord Esher commenting on Stables v Eley If that case decides that a person who sends out a carriage with his name upon it holds himself out as being responsible to any one injured by it through the negligence of the driver I think it was wrongly decided The highest that that case can be put on as an authority is that the name being affixed to the carriage is prima facie evidence of the liability of the person whose name is so affixed as owner but that prima facie liability may be rebutted by evidence Smith v Bailey 40 W R 28 Ct of App Eng EVIDENCE  DAMAGES  COLLATERAL MATER  In proceedings by a city to condemn a waterright which is not being utilized evidence of the amount recently paid by the city for a similar neighboring waterright is incompetent In re Thompson 28 N E Rep 388 N Y Authority is very evenly divided upon this question In Massachusetts New Hampshire Illinois Iowa and Wisconsin such evidence is admitted Pennsyl vania New York Georgia and California agree with the principal case INFANCY  RIGHT OF NEXT FRIEND TO COMPROMISE  An action of tort was brought by plaintiffs father as next friend At the trial defendant offered to show in bar of the action an executed accord and satisfaction between himself and the father Hdd that evidence upon this point was rightly excluded Such a settlement made for less than the full amount of the infatts demand is beyond the power of the next friend and will not bindl the infant unless it is confirmed by the court or unless with the approval of the infants counsel final judgment is entered in accordance with it  Tripp v Gifford 29 N E Rep 208 Mass INSURANCE  QUASICONTRACT  A married woman having insured her life in the defendant company by a

recover the amount of premiums paid McElwee v New York Co 47 Fed Rep 795 There would seem to be a good quasicontract here upon which the defendant might be charged in equity for the full amount of the

a claim against his mothers executor for board attendance support etc furnished by the son to the mother during the latters lifetime held that such services on account of the relationship are presumed to have been furnished gratuitously and that such presumption can only be rebutted by clear proof of an agreement between the parties for compensation Wilkes v Cornelius 27 Pac Rep 135 Ore The court do not seem to have had in mind the leading New Hampshire case of Sceva v True 53 N H 627 which holds what is conceived to be the true rule that if the claimant in such cases performed the services with the expectation of being remunerated he is entitled to recover In this view it is immaterial whether or not there was an express agreement between the parties PROPERTY RIPARIAN RIGHTS  MILLSITE  The owner of a millsite at which a mill was formerly operated but which had not been in use within six years of the time of bringing the action cannot recover for the injury to the millsite or

Where defendant is the owner of an easement to run water in an open ditch over the plaintiffs land and undertakes to lay pipes in the ditch of no greater carrying capacity than the ditch even though the change would be less burdensome to the plaintiff and more convenient to defendant nevertheless the alteration would tend to substitute a new and different easement and will be enjoined Allen et al

to his son for life and after his death to all the children of his son whether then or thereafter to be born who should attain twentyone He de clared that his son should not have any power to sell or dispose of his life es tate and in case his said son should attempt to sell or dispose of the same or become bankrupt or the estate should be taken in execution by any process of law for benefit of any creditor then he declared that the devise to his son should immediately become void as if such son were then actually dead and that the estate so devised to him should thenceforth vest in the persons who under the devises before mentioned would be next entitled The sons interest was taken on execution and consequently became void Held that in order to carry out testators intention the gift over must be construed not as a contingent remain der but as an executory devise so as to enable all the sons children in existence at the date of the order or born or to be born thereafter to share in the prop erty on their attaining twentyone Blackman v Fysh 39 W R 520 Eng Devise subject to a life estate to the use of such child or children of the said E D as either before or after the death of

TROVER  PLEDGE  PROPERTY IN THE GOODS  Goods were shipped under a bill of lading which provided that they the goods were to be delivered to the order of the consignor or his assignees The invoices were sent to the consignee and a bill of exchange for the price drawn by the consignor on the consignee which together with the bill of lading endorsed in blark was sold and delivered by the consignor to his bankers with a hypothecation note author izing the bankers to retain the bill of lading and sell the goods if the consignee either declined to accept the bill of exchange or failed to pay it at maturity The goods on the arrival of the ship were deposited by the shipowner with the defendants a railway company to be delivered up on order of the ship owners The consignee of the goods who had accepted the bill of exchange and paid the freight induced the defendants wrongfully to hand over the goods to him without his producing either the bill of lading or any delivery drder from the shipowners At a subsequent date when the bill of exchange was about to become payable the consignee requested the plaintiffs who were his bankers to pay it and debit his account therewith The plaintiffs accordingly paid the bill of exchange and received it and the bill of lading from the consignors bankers and also obtained a delivery order from the shipowner but when they presented these to the defendant company it was discovered that the latter had already given up the goods to the consignee In an action for damages for the nondelivery of the goods by the defendant to the plaintiffs Held that the plaintiffs were pledgees at law of the goods and as such could maintain an action of trover or detinue against the defendant company for nondelivery of the goods and the fact of the wrongful delivery of the goods having occurred before the accrual of the plaintiffs title afforded no ground of defence to the action Bristol Bank v Midland RR Co 40 W R 148 Ct of App Eng See note p

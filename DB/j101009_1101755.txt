AFTER HAVING HEARD ALL THE EVIDENCE OFFERED IN THE CAUSE REPORTED AMONG OTHER THINGS AS FOLLOWS 1 HE FINDS THAT THERE IS IN THE POSSESSION OF THE SAID LYDIA LAWSON 440 WHICH WAS THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR THE COAL SOLD OFF OF THE 88 ACRES WHICH WAS GIVEN TO HER BY W W MCCOY IN HIS LIFETIME AND ABOUT THE YEAR 1880 ANDWHICH SAID COAL WAS SOLD AT THE PRICE OF 5 PER ACRE THAT THIS 440 WAS RETAINED BY THE SAID LYDIA LAWSON OUT OF THE PROCEEDS DERIVED FROM THE CASHING OF A CHECK IN THE NAME OF W W MCCOY FOR 1540 WHICH CHECK EMBRACED THE AMOUNT DUE FOR THE SALE OF THE COAL ON THE 88 ACRES OF LYDIA LAWSON YOUR COMMISSIONER FINDS THAT LYDIA LAWSON WAS JUSTLY ENTITLED TO RETAIN THE SAID 440 AND THAT THE ESTATE OF THE SAID W W MCCOY HAS NO CLAIM AGAINST HER WHATEVER ON THAT ACCOUNT 2 YOUR COMMISSIONER FINDS THAT THE 88 ACRES WAS GIVEN TO LYDIA LAWSON BY HER FATHER W W MCCOY IN THE YEAR 1880 AS AN ADVANCEMENT AND AT THE TIME THIS ADVANCEMENT WAS MADE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN AN HEIRS PART OF HIS REAL ESTATE BUT THERE HAS BEEN PRODUCED BEFORE YOUR COMMISSIONER NO EVI DENCE WHICH WOULD JUSTIFY HIM IN COMING TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS INTENDED AS AN ADVANCEMENT IN FULL OF HER PROSPECTIVE INTEREST IN THE SAID ESTATE OF THE SAID W W MCCOY WHETHER REAL OR PERSONAL OR BOTH AND THAT ACCORDING TO THE DECISION OF THE COURT OF APPEALS IN THE CASE OF HEADRICK V MCDOWELL AND OTHERS REPORTED IN 102 VA 124 45 S E 804 65 L R A 578 102 AM ST REP 843 IT COULD NOT BE LEGALLY CONSTRUED AS AN ADVANCEMENT IN FULL OF HER INTEREST IN THE ESTATE OF THE SAID W W MCCOY ALTHOUGH THAT MAY HAVE BEEN THE INTENTION AT THE TIME IT WAS GIVEN YOUR COMMISSIONER FINDS THAT THE VALUE OF THE SAID LAND AT THE TIME THE GIFT WAS MADE WAS 1 PER ACTE AND AT THE TIME THIS LAND WAS EQUAL IN VALUE TO THE ACREAGE OF THE REST OF THE LAND OF THE SAID W W MCCOY AND THAT ITS PRESENT VALUE IS ABOUT 10 PER ACRE YOUR COMMISSIONER FINDS THAT THIS GIFT WAS MADE IN 1880 AND THAT IN PURSUANCE THEREOF THE SAID LYDIA LAWSON AND HER HUSBAND WENT UPON THE LAND CLEARED AND FENCED IT PLANTED OUT AN ORCHARD IMPROVED IT AND PUT BUILDINGS THEREON AND THAT THE SAID LYDIA LAWSON HAS THE RIGHT TO CALL FOR A DEED IF SHE HAS NOT ALREADY RECEIVED ONE 3 AS TO THE THIRD INQUIRY IN REGARD TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF 19061 61512 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTKR RHODA RIGSBY YOUR COMMISSIONER FINDS THAT THE SAID RHODA RIGSBY RECEIVED A DEBT ON WILLIAM HAYS FOR 100 ABOUT THE YEAR 1881 AND THAT THIS WAS INTENDED AS A PARTIAL ADVANCEMENT BY THE SAID W W MCCOY TO THE SAID RHODA RIGSBY YOUR COM MISSIONER FURTHER FINDS THAT THE SAID RHODA RIGSBY HAS NEVER RECEIVED ANY LAND FROM THE SAID W W MCCOY 6 YOUR COMMISSIONER DEEMS IT PERTINENT TO STATE THAT IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS FINDING ABOVE THAT THE SAID LYDIA LAWSON SHOULD BE CHARGED WITH 88 AS OF THE 1ST DAY OF JANUARY 1880 R C C MCCOY SHOULD BE CHARGED WITH 40 AS OF THE 1ST DAY OF JANUARY 1876 THAT RHODA RIGSBY SHOULD BE CHARGED WITH 100 OF THE 1ST DAY OF JANUARY 1884 THAT LANEY MCCOY SHOULD BE CHARGED WITH 800 AS OF THE 1ST DAY OF JANUARY 1896 TO THIS REPORT THE COMPLAINANTS FILED SEVEN EXCEPTIONS ALL OF WHICH AS TO THE PART OF THE REPORT ABOVE SET OUT WERE OVERRULED AND THE REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER CONFIRMED BY THE COURT AND FROM THAT DECREE THIS APPEAL WAS TAKEN IN CONSIDERING THE CASE IT SHOULD BE BPRNE IN MIND THAT THE SEVERAL ADVANCEMENTS MADE OR INTENDED TO BE MADE BY W W MCCOY TO HIS FOUR CHILDREN CHRIS MCCOY LYDIA LAWSON RHODA RIGSBY AND LANEY MCCOY WERE AT THE MOST BUT INCOMPLETED ADVANCEMENTS THE LANDS WERE NEVER CONVEYED TO THESE RE SPECTIVE PARTIES EXCEPT THAT OF LYDIA LAWSON IN WHICH DEED IT WAS EXPRESSLY STATED THAT IT WAS NOT TO TAKE EFFECT UNTIL THE DEATH OF W W MCCOY AND THE LANDS INTENDED FOR RHODA RIGSBY WHICH IN FACT SHE NEVER HAD POSSESSION OF WERE CONVEYED BY W W MCCOY TO ANOTHER PARTY AND THE LANDS SET APART FOR CHRIS MCCOY TAKEN POSSESSION OF BY HIM AND VALUABLE IMPROVE MENTS PUT THEREON WERE AS WE HAVE SEEN ALSO CONVEYED AWAY BY W W MCCOY CONSIDERING FIRST THE CASE OF CHRIS MCCOY THE EVIDENCE IS CLEAR WE THINK THAT THE 80 ACRES OF LAND SET APART TO HIM IN 1876 WAS NOT THEN WORTH MORE THAN 50 CENTS PER ACRE UPON THIS LAND AS WE HAVE SEEN HE MADE VALUABLE IMPROVEMENTS AND IT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY SOLD AND CONVEYED BY W W MCCOY FOR 1200 THE CONDITIONS WERE SUCH AT THE TIME OF THIS SALE THAT CHRIS MCCOY WAS ENTITLED TO DEMAND OF AND RECEIVE FROM HIS FATHER A CONVEYANCE OF THE LAND HE HOWEVER ASSENTED TO THE SALE BY HIS FATHER AGREEING TO TAKE IN LIEU OF THE LAND THE PUR CHASE MONEY THEREFOR AND ACTUALLY RECEIVED 1020 IN HIS AN SWER FILED IN THIS CAUSE HE DEMANDS THE RESIDUE OF THE 1200 AND AGREES THAT IF HE RECEIVES THAT AMOUNT IT SHALL BE CONSIDERED AS IN FULL OF HIS SHARE OR INTEREST IN THE LANDS OF WHICH HIS FATHER DIED SEISED AND POSSESSED THE DECREE APPEALED FROM GAVE HIM THE RIGHT OF RECOVERY OF 180 FROM THE PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE OF W W MCCOY MAKING NO PROVISION HOWEVER AGAINST HIS PAR 616 DECTICIPATION IN THE REAL ESTATE NOW TO BE DIVIDED AMONG THE HEIRS OF W W MCCOY WE ARE OF THE OPINION THAT INASMUCH AS CHRIS MCCOY ELECTS TO TAKE THE 1200 AS HIS FULL SHARE OF THE REAL ESTATE OWNED BY HIS FATHER AT HIS DEATH THE DECREE SHOULD HAVE UPON HIS RE CEIVING THE SAID BALANCE OF 180 DEBARRED HIM FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE DIVISION OF THE LAND NOW TO BE MADE IN THIS CAUSE BUT HE SHOULD NOT BE DEBARRED FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE DIVISION OF THE PERSONAL ASSETS NOW IN THE HANDS OF THE ADMINISTRATOR OF W W MCCOY FOR DISTRIBUTION UPON THE PRINCIPLE THAT EQUALITY IS EQUITY ADVANCEMENTS MADE IN THE LIFETIME OF A PARENT MUST BE BROUGHT INTO HOTCHPOT BY THOSE WHO RECEIVE THEM IN ORDER THAT THERE MAY BE PERFECT EQUALITY AMONG THOSE TO SHARE IN THE ESTATE OF THE PARENT AND THIS RULE IS UNAFFECTED BY THE FACT THAT SOME OF THE HEIRS AT THE TIME OF RECEIVING THEIR ADVANCEMENTS ENTERED INTO COVENANTS WITH THE PARENT WHEREBY THEY RELINQUISHED ALL INTEREST IN OR CLAIM TO ANY PORTION OF THE ESTATE THEN OWNED OR WHICH MIGHT BE THEREAFTER ACQUIRED BY THE PARENT AND 4S TO WHICH HE MIGHT DIE INTESTATE HEADRICK V MCDOWELL 102 VA 124 45 S E 804 65 L R A 578 102 AM ST REP 843 IT IS NOT BY REASON OF ANY COVENANT WITH HIS FATHER WHEREBY HE RELINQUISHED ALL INTEREST IN OR CLAIM TO ANY PORTION OF THE REAL ESTATE OF WHICH HIS FATHER MIGHT DIE SEISED AND POSSESSED THAT CHRIS MCCOY SHOULD BE DEBARRED OF PARTICIPATION IN THE DIVISION OF THE REAL ESTATE IN THIS CAUSE BUT BECAUSE OF HIS EXPRESSED WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT THE PROCEEDS OF THE SALE OF THE 80 ACRES SET APART TO HIM IN 1876 IN FULL OF HIS INTEREST IN THE REAL ESTATE OWNED BY HIS FATHER AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH AND CLEARLY WE THINK TO DISPOSE OF IN THIS WAY CHRIS MCCOY AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE DIVISION OF SAID REAL ESTATE CAN WORK NO INJURY OR INJUSTICE TO THE OTHER HEIRS INTERESTED FOR IF HE SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO BRING INTO HOTCHPOT THE 80 ACRES OF LAND INTENDED FOR HIM AS AN AD VANCEMENT HE COULD ONLY BE CHARGED WITH THE UNIMPROVED VALUE THEREOF WITH RESPECT TO THE 88 ACRES OF LAND RECEIVED BY LYDIA LAWSON IN 1880 UPON WHICH SHE SOON THEREAFTER MADE VALUABLE PERMANENT IMPROVEMENTS AND RETAINED THE SAME IN HER POSSESSION UP TO THE PRESENT TIME HER FATHER MAKING NO CLAIM TO THE LAND PRIOR TO HIS DEATH THE SAID LAND BEING APPROXIMATELY ONENINTH OF THE LANDS THEN AND THEREAFTER OWNED BY W W MCCOY THE COURT IS OF OPINION THAT LYDIA LAWSON SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO RETAIN THE SAID LAND IF SHE SO ELECTS AS HER FULL SHARE OF THE REAL ESTATE OF HER FATHER AND IN THE EVENT THAT SHE ELECTS TO RETAIN THE SAID LAND UPON THESE TERMS SHE SHOULD BE ALLOWED ALSO TO RETAIN THE 440 TURNED OVER TO HER BY W W MCCOY FOR THE COAL SOLD BY HIM FROM THE SAID LAND BUT IF SHE DOES NOT SO ELECT SHE SHOULD BE MCOY V MCOY 617 1906112 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER REQUIRED TO BRING THE SAID LAND INTO HOTCHPOT AND ALSO THE 440 AND BE ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DIVISION OF THE REAL ESTATE OF WHICH W W MCCOY DIED SEISED AND POSSESSED THE SAID LAND TO BE CHARGED TO HER AT 1 PER ACRE ITS VALUE AT THE TIME IT WAS TURNED OVER TO HER AND THE 440 AS OF THE DATE SHE RECEIVED IT AND HAVE CREDIT FOR SUCH PERMANENT IMPROVEMENTS AS SHE MAY HAVE PUT UPON THE SAID 88 ACRES OF LAND THE DIFFERENCE IF ANY BETWEEN THE 440 PLUS THE VALUE OF THE 88 ACRES OF LAND AT 1 PER ACRE AND THE AGGREGATE VALUE OF THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT SHE MAY HAVE PUT UPON THE LAND TO BE THE AMOUNT WITH WHICH SHE IS TO BE CHARGED AS AN ADVANCEMENT UPON HER INTEREST IN THE REAL ESTATE TO BE DIVIDED IN THIS CAUSE SHE SHOULD ALSO BE ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE PERSONAL ESTATE LEFT BY W W MCCOY AT HIS DEATH FROM WHATEVER SOURCE DERIVED IF IT BE AS IS CONTENDED THAT THE PERSONAL ESTATE WHICH IS IN MONEY IN THE HANDS OF THE ADMINISTRATOR WAS REALIZED FROM THE SALE OF COAL AND TIMBER UPON THE LANDS TO BE NOW DIVIDED IT DOES NOT ALTER THE CASE W W MCCOY HAD THE RIGHT TO DO AS HE PLEASED WITH HIS OWN PROPERTY AND IF HE CHOSE TO SELL THE COAL AND TIMBER FROM HIS LANDS CONVERTING THE SAME INTO MONEY IT IS A MATTER THAT CANNOT AFFECT ANY RIGHT THAT THE HEIRS OR DISTRIBUTEES OF HIS ESTATE HAVE WITH RESPECT TO SO MUCH OF THE COMMISSIONERS REPORT CON FIRMED BY THE DECREE APPEALED FROM AS HOLDS THAT RHODA RIGSBY NEVER RECEIVED ANY LAND FROM HER FATHER W W MCCOY BUT DID RECEIVE THE PROCEEDS FROM 80 ACRES WHICH HE SOLD TO WILLIAM HAYS THE COURT IS OF OPINION THAT THERE IS NO ERROR THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT W W MCCOY DID INTEND THAT HIS DAUGHTER RHODA RIGSBY SHOULD HAVE 80 ACRES OF LAND AS AN ADVANCEMENT UPON HER PROSPECTIVE INTEREST IN HIS LANDS BUT HE MADE HER NO DEED FOR IT NOR PARTED WITH ITS POSSESSION AND SOLD IT TO ANOTHER PARTY TURNING THE CLAIM FOR THE PURCHASE MONEY OVER TO HER AMOUNTING TO 100 THEREFORE THE CONTENTION THAT SHE SHOULD BE CHARGED WITH THE 80 ACRES OF LAND AS AN ADVANCEMENT TO HER IN FULL OF ANY INTEREST OR CLAIM THAT SHE MIGHT THEREAFTER HAVE IN THE RESIDUE OF W W MCCOYS LANDS CANNOT BE SUSTAINED AND SHE SHOULD ONLY BE CHARGED WITH THIS 100 IN THE DIVISION OF THE REAL ESTATE OF W W MCCOY NOW TO BE DIVIDED IN THE CASE OF WEST V JONES 85 VA 616 8 S E 468 TWO DAUGHTERS WERE NOMINALLY GIVEN BUT RECEIVED NO TITLE TO A TRACT OF LAND THE FATHER AFTERWARDS HAVING SOLD IT FOR 10000 GAVE THEM EACH 5000 IN CURRENCY AND IT WAS HELD THAT THEY SHOULD BE CHARGED WITH THE AMOUNT OF THAT CURRENCY SO RECEIVED BY THEM AS ADVANCEMENTS THAT CASE CLEARLY CONTROLS THIS CASE AS TO THE RIGHT OF RHODA RIGSBY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DIVISION OF W W MCCOYS REAL ESTATE AND LEAVES HER ALSO TO SHARE IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF HIS DEC 618MCOY V MCOY PERSONAL ESTATE IT NOT BEING CLAIMED THAT SHE HAS RECEIVED ANY PART OF THE PERSONAL ESTATE OF HER FATHER IN THE WAY OF AN ADVANCE MENT AND THE CASE CITED FURTHER ILLUSTRATES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RULE GOVERNING A COMPLETED ADVANCEMENT AND THE RULE WHERE IT WAS INCOMPLETE THIS BRINGS US TO THE CONSIDERATION OF THE RIGHT OF LANEY MC COY ANOTHER ONE OF THE CHILDREN TO PARTICIPATE IN THE REAL ESTATE TO BE DIVIDED IN THIS CAUSE THE COURT BELOW HAVING AFFIRMED THE FINDING OF THE COMMISSIONER THAT SHE SHOULD BE CHARGED WITH THE 80 ACRES OF LAND SHE RECEIVED FROM HER FATHER IN 1896 AT A VALUA TION OF 800 AS OF THE 1ST DAY OF JANUARY 1896 LANEY MCCOY RECEIVED THE LAND AS OF THE DATE NAMED AND HAS BEEN IN POSSESSION AND CONTROL THEREOF EVER SINCE AND THE PROOF SUSTAINS WE THINK THE FINDING THAT ITS VALUE WAS AS FOUND BY THE COMMISSIONER 800 IT FURTHER APPEARS THAT THE 80 ACRES OF LAND WAS APPROXIMATELY HER ALIQUOT PORTION OF HER FATHERS REAL ESTATE AND IF SHE SHOULD ELECT NOT TO BRING THE SAME INTO HOTCHPOT SHE SHOULD RECEIVE A CONVEYANCE OF THE LEGAL TITLE THERETO UNDER A DECREE OF THE COURT IN THIS CAUSE AS HER FULL SHARE OF THE REAL ES TATE OWNED BY HER FATHER AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH BUT SHOULD SHE ELECT TO BRING THE LAND INTO HOTCHPOT IN ORDER TO SHARE IN THE LAND TO BE DIVIDED IN THIS CAUSE SHE SHOULD BE CHARGED AS AGAINST HER INTEREST THEREIN WITH THE VALUE OF THE LAND ADVANCED TO HER VIZ 800 AS OF JANUARY 1 1895 WITHOUT INTEREST THE GENERAL RULE BEING AS IS WELL SETTLED THAT ADVANCEMENTS DO NOT BEAR IN TEREST THE COMMISSIONER ALSO REPORTED THAT MARY E HAYS SHOULD BE CHARGED WITH 80 AS OF THE 1ST DAY OF JANUARY 1884  BUT AS THERE WAS NO FOUNDATION IN THE RECORD FOR THIS FINDING AN EXCEPTION THERETO WAS RIGHTLY SUSTAINED THE DECREE APPEALED FROM AUTHORIZES A M VICARS ADMINIS TRATOR OF W W MCCOY TO COLLECT FROM RHODA RIGSBY CHRIS MCCOY LYDIA LAWSON AND LANEY MCCOY THE AMOUNT OF THE ADVANCEMENTS RECEIVED BY THEM RESPECTIVELY FROM THEIR FATHER TO BE DISTRIBUTED TOGETHER WITH ALL OTHER ASSETS IN THE ADMINISTRA TORS HANDS OR WHICH MIGHT COME INTO HIS HANDS TO THOSE ENTITLED THERETO RESPECTIVELY THIS WAS ERROR WHILE A CHILD RECEIVING AN ADVANCEMENT FROM A PARENT MAY BRING SUCH ADVANCEMENT INTO HOTCHPOT AND SHARE IN THE DIVISION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE ESTATE OF THE PARENT AFTER HIS DEATH HE CANNOT BE REQUIRED TO PAY BACK TO THE ESTATE ANY PART OF THE ADVANCEMENT AND IF IT TURNS OUT THAT HE HAS RECEIVED BY WAY OF AN ADVANCEMENT AN EQUAL SHARE WITH THE OTHERS OF THE ESTATE OR MORE THAN HIS SHARE HE CAN ONLY BE EX CLUDED FROM PARTICIPATION IN THE DIVISION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE ESTATE WE ARE AWARE THAT THE FOREGOING RULINGS OF THIS COURT MAY NOT PRODUCE PERFECT EQUALITY IN THE DIVISION AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE 19061 61912 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER ESTATE OF W W MCCOY AMONG HIS NINE CHILDREN BUT ARE OF OPINION THAT SUCH A RESULT WILL THEREBY BE SO NEARLY ATTAINED AS IS POSSIBLE UNDER THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES DISCLOSED IN THE RECORD THE DECREE OF THE LOWER COURT REQUIRES THE COMPLAINANTS AP PELLANTS HERE TO PAY THE COSTS OF THE EXECUTION OF THE DECREE OF REFERENCE ABOVE REFERRED TO AND THIS RULING IS ASSIGNED AS ERROR WE ARE OF OPINION THAT THE RULING IS ERRONEOUS THIS IS A SUIT FOR THE PARTITION OF THE REAL ESTATE OF W W MCCOY DECEASED AND A DISTRIBUTION OF HIS PERSONAL ESTATE AMONG HIS HEIRS AT LAW AND DISTRIBUTEES AND THE REFERENCE OF THE CAUSE TO A COMMISSIONER TO MAKE THE INQUIRIES DIRECTED WAS BUT ANCILLARY TO THE OTHER PRO CEEDINGS IN THE CAUSE THE INQUIRIES DIRECTED WERE THE USUAL AND NECESSARY INQUIRIES IN SUCH A CASE AND IT IS THE UNIVERSAL PRACTICE IN THE COURTS OF THIS STATE TO PAY THE COSTS OF THE ENTIRE PROCEED INGS OUT OF THE ASSETS OF THE DECEDENTS ESTATE NOTHING APPEARS IN THE RECORD TO TAKE THE CASE OUT OF THE GENERAL RULE AS TO COSTS GOVERNING IN SUCH CASES IT FOLLOWS THAT THE DECREE APPEALED FROM IN SO FAR AS IT CON FLICTS WITH THIS OPINION MUST BE

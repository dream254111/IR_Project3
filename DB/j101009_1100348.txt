J101009,THE VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER,1100348,CONTRACTS LIMITING CARRIERS LIABILITY IN VIRGINIA,I245908,VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER VOL IX JUNE 1903 NO 2 COPYRIGHT 1903 BY J P BELL COMPANY CONTRACTS LIMITING CARRIERS LIABILITY IN VIRGINIA IN 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER 849 THIS QUESTION IS DISCUSSED IN AN INTERESTING PAPER BY JOHN G HAYTHE ESQ OF THE LYNCH BURG BAR WHOSE ARTICLE HAS BEEN READ WITH PROFIT AND PLEASURE BY THE WRITER SUCH CONTRACTS ARE MADE DAILY IN FACT EVERY BILL OF LADING EM BRACES SUCH A CONTRACT IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER AND IN THE GREAT MAJORITY OF CASES THE AMOUNT INVOLVED IS TOO SMALL TO GIVE THE COURT OF APPEALS OF VIRGINIA JURISDICTION HENCE THE NISI PRIUS COURTS HAVE TO SETTLE THE MANY IMPORTANT AND OFTEN DIFFICULT QUES TIONS ARISING GENERALLY WITHOUT THE AID OF A DECISION OF THE COURT OF APPEALS ON THE QUESTION INVOLVED THESE FACTS WILL PERHAPS JUSTIFY ANOTHER PAPER UPON A QUESTION OF SUCH INTEREST AND GEN ERAL IMPORTANCE AND IT IS WITH THE HOPE OF BEING ABLE TO SHED A LITTLE FURTHER LIGHT UPON THE LAW OF SUCH CONTRACTS PARTICULARLY IN THIS STATE THAT THIS PAPER IS PREPARED THE FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION THAT PRESENTS ITSELF AND THE ONE UPON WHICH WE FIND THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY AND CONFLICT OF OPINION IS CAN A CARRIER CONTRACT AGAINST LIABILITY FOR ITS OWN NEGLIGENCE THE ORIGIN OF SUCH CONTRACTS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE PECULIAR HARDSHIPS AND GREAT INJUSTICE OF THE RULE AS IT WAS FIXED BY THE COMMON LAW WHICH MADE THE CARRIER LIABLE FOR THE LOSS OF GOODS IN ITS CARE THOUGH CAUSED WITHOUT ITS FAULT THE MEASURE OF THIS LIABILITY WAS THE FULL VALUE OF THE PROPERTY THOUGH THE VALUE WAS NOT DISCLOSED BY THE SHIPPER AND NOT KNOWN BY THE CARRIER UNTIL IT WAS CALLED ON TO PAY IT AFTER THE LOSS THE RULE WAS RIGOROUS AND ADMITTED OF NO EXCEPTIONS SAVE WHERE THE LOSS WAS BY THE74 9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER JLUNE ACT OF GOD OR THE PUBLIC ENEMY IN ENGLAND THE CARRIERS ACT HAS MODIFIED THIS RULE AS TO THE ARTICLES THEREIN ENUMERATED ARTICLES OF LARGE VALUE AND SMALL BULK AND THE SAME MODIFICATION IS MADE AS TO WATER CARRIERS AND CERTAIN ENUMERATED ARTICLES BY A LIKE STATUTE PASSED BY CONGRESS AND BOTH OF THESE STATUTES RE QUIRE THE SHIPPER OF ANY OF THE ARTICLES NLAMED TO DISCLOSE TO THE CARRIER THE TRUE CHARACTER AND REAL VALUE AT THE TIME OF THE DE LIVERY AND ACCEPTANCE FOR SHIPMELNT BY THESE CONTRACTS THE CARRIER SOUGHT TO HAVE THE SHIPPER WAIVE THIS COMMON LAW LIABILITY THUS ATTEMPTING TO FIX THE LIABILITY BY EXPRESS CONTRACT BETWEEN THE PARTIES AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE LIABILITY FIXED BY THE LAW AS WAS TO BE EXPECTED IN THE EFFORTS OF THE CARRIERS TO RELIEVE THEMSELVES FROM THE EFFECTS OF THIS IN FLEXIBLE RULE WHEREIN IT OPERATED HARSHLY AND UNJUSTLY THEY UNDERTOOK TO GO TOO FAR AND SOUGHT A REMEDY MUCH BROADER AND MORE COMPREHENSIVE THLAN WAS NCCESSARY TO PROTECT THEM FROM THE MISCHIEFS OF WHICH THEY ORIGINALLY HALD JUST CAUSE OF COIN PLAINT ANDC UNDERTOOK BY THESE CONTRACTS TO SHIELD THEMSELVES FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR OWN NEGLIGENCE IT WVAS RIGHT AND PROPER FOR THE CARRIERS TO PROTECT TIEMSELVES FROM LIABILITY FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE CAUSED BY SHEER ACCIDEIIT AND WITLHOUT THEIR FAULT OR NEGLECT AND TO THIS EXTENT SUCH CONTRACTS HAVE BEEN ALMOST UNIVERSALLY UPHELD BY THE COURTS OF THIS COUNTRY1 IN THE SAYERS CASE THE CONTRACT RELIED ON BY THE CARRIER PRO VIDED THAT IN CONSIDERATION OF A REDUCED RATE THE SHIPPER DOES ASSUMUE ALL THE RISKS AND RELEASE THE CARRIER FROM ALL LIABILITY NOT ESTABLISHED TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE GROSS NEGLI GENCE OR DELINQUENCY OF THE CARRIER THE OPINION IS AN EX CEEDINGLY STRONG CLEAR AND ELABORATE ONE DELIVERED BY JUDLGE CHRISTIAN AND HE THUS EXPRESSES HIS CONCLUSION FROM THIS REVIEW OF THE AMERICAN AND ENGLISH DECISIONS I AM CONSTRAINED TO CONCLUDE THAT THE GREAT WEIGHT OF AUTHORITY IS IN FAVOR OF DECLARING THAT THE SALUTARY RULE OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY WHICH FORBIDS A COMMNON CARRIER FROM EXEMPTING HIMSELF FROM LIABILITY BY EXPRESS CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE FOR HIS OWN NEGLIGENCE WHETHER GROSS OR ORDINARY SHOULD BE FIRMLY ADHERED TO AND MAIN TAINED BY THE COURTS OF THIS STATE THIS DECISION RESTS UPON PRINCIPLE AND PUBLIC POLICY AND WAS NOT CONTROLLED BY ANY STATUTE FOR THE STATUTE WE NOW HAVE ON THIS SUBJECT WAS INSERTED IN THE CODE OF 1887 FOR THE FIRST TIME 1 HUTCHINSON ON CARRIERS SEC 248 VA  T R R CO V SAYERS 26 GRATT 3281903 CONTRACTS LIMITING CARRIER S LIABILITY 75 AND WAS EVIDENTLY PASSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENACTING THIS DE CISION INTO STATUTE LAW IT IS TO BE OBSERVED THAT ALL THROUGH THE OPINION OF JUDGE CHRISTIAN HE USES THE WORDS LIMIT AND EX EMPT AS MEANING THE SAME THING AND IT IS CLEAR THAT THIS CASE DECIDES THAT A COMMON CARRIER CAN NEITHER LIMIT NOR EXEMPT ITSELF FROM LIABILITY FOR A LOSS CAUSED BY ITS OWN NEGLIGENCE IT IS TRUE THAT JUDGE CHRISTIAN IS HERE TALKING ABOUT A CONTRACT LIMITING THE CAUSES FOR WHICH THE CARRIER SHALL BE LIABLE AND NOT A CONTRACT LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF THE RECOVERY OR FIXING THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY LOST BUT THE PRINCIPLES ARE IDENTICAL AND THE PRACTICAL OPERATION AND EFFECT ARE THE SAME IN EITHER CASE CAN IT BE MAINTAINED FOR A MOMENT THAT A CONTRACT WHICH LIMITS THE AZOUNT OF THE CARRIERS LIABILITY TO A CERTAIN SUM LESS THAN THE ACTUAL VALUE DOES NOT EXEMPT THE CARRIER TO THE EXTENT OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE LIMITED VALUE AND THE ACTUAL VALUE BUT FOR THE CONTRACT WOULD NOT THE CARRIER HAVE TO ANSWER FOR THE FULL VALUE  A STATUTE WHICH LIMITS THE TIME WITHIN WHICH AN ACTION MUST BE BROUGHT EXEMPTS THE DEFENDANT FROM LIABILITY AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THAT TIME A LAW WHICH EXEMPTS CER TAIN PROPERTY FROM TAXATION AND DISTRESS OR LEVY LIMITS THE PROPERTY SUBJECT TO TAXATION AND LEVY FROM THE FOREGOING IT WVOULD SEEM CLEAR THAT THE SAYERS CASE DECIDED POINT BLANK THAT A COMMON CARRIER COULD NOT CONTRACT AGAINST ITS OWN NEGLIGENCE AND THAT THE REASON AND PRINCIPLES MAINTAINED IN THAT CASE AS WELL AS THE EXPRESS LANGUAGE WOULD APPLY WITH AS MUCH FORCE TO THE CONTRACT IN THE CASE OF P  D R B CO V PAYNE2 AS TO THE ONE THEN BEFORE THE COURT IT ALSO SEEMS CEAR THAT OUR STATUTE SEC 1296 CODE 1887 NEGATIVES ANY SUCH NICE DISTINCTION BE TWEEN THE WORDS LIMIT AND EXEMPT AS IS DRAWN IN RAILROAD V PAYNIE SUPRA AS ILREADY STATED THIS STATUTE IS MANIFESTLY THE EXPRESSION OF LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL OF THE DOCTRINE LAID DOWN IN RAILROAD V SAYERS AND THE VERY CAREFUL OPINION IN THAT CASE TREATS AND USES THESE TWO WORDS ALL THROUGH THE OPINION AS MEAN ING THE SAME THING THE STATUTE ADOPTS AND USES ONLY ONE OF THESE WORDS BECAUSE IT WAS PLAIN THAT THEY DID MEAN THE SAME THING IN THE OPINION OF THE COURT AND THEREFORE IT IS TO BE SUP POSED THAT THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED THE COURTS CLEARLY EXPRESSED CONSTRUCTION OF THEIR MEANING AND EFFECT IN REFERENCE TO SUCH 286 VA 48176 9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER JUNE CONTRACTS IT WOULD SEEM THEREFORE THAT THE PLAIN INTENT AND MEANING OF OUR STAUUTE IS THAT NO AGREEMENT MADE BY A COMMON CARRIER FOR THE PURPOSE OF RELIEVING PROTECTING LIMITING OR EXEMPTING SUCH CARRIER FROM LIABILITY FOR INJURY OR LOSS OCCASIONED BY ITS OWN NEGLECT OR MISCONDUCT SHALL BE VALID THIS IS AS PLAIN AS IS THE INTENTION TO PERMIT THE CARRIER TO CONTRACT FOR NONLIABILITY IN CASES WHERE THE LOSS WAS NOT CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE THIS STATUTE DOES NOT CHANGE THE CARRIERS LIABILITY AS IT WAS BEFORE THE STATUTE IT SIMPLY BARS THE CARRIERS POWER TO CHANGE THE LAW BY CONTRACT AS TO A LOSS CAUSED BY ITS OWN NEGLI GENCE AND WHILE BY CLEAR IMPLICATION IT PERMITS THE CARRIER TO COTRACT FOR NONLIABILITY AS TO ALL OTHER LOSSES ITS CLEAR INTENT PURPOSE AND MEANING IS TO FORBID ANY AGREEMENT INTENDED TO CHANGE OR MODIFY ITS LIABILITY FOR LOSSES CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE AND IT IS PLAIN THAT ANY AGREEMENT WHICH DOES NOT LEAVE THIS LIABILITY FOR NEGLIGENCE AS IT WAS BEFORE THE AGREEMENT WAS MADE MUST VIOLATE THE STATUTE IT IS A CANON OF STATUTORY CON STRUCTION THAT WE ARE TO LOOK TO THE CONDITIONS THE MISCHIEF AND THE CONTEMPORANEOUS HISTORY WHICH CALLED FORTH THE ENACTMENT THE SAYERS CASE IS A PART OF THE HISTORY OF THAT STATUTE AND THE CONTRACT IN THAT CASE PRESENTS THE CONDITIONS AND THE MISCHIEF SOUGHT TO BE MET BY THE LEGISLATURE AND IT SEEMS TO ME TO BE OBVIOUS THAT THE OBJECT OF THE LEGISLATURE WAS TO DEFEAT THE OBJECT OF THE CONTRACT WHENEVER THAT WAS MADE TO LESSEN THE CARRIERS LIABILITY FOR NEGLIGENCE BY DEPRIVING THE CARRIER OF THE POWER TO MAKE SUCH CONTRACTS THE GRANT OF A POWER BY A STATUTE OR OTHER INSTRUMENT TO DO A PARTICULAR THING NECESSARILY IMPLIES THE POWER TO DO EVERYTHING ESSENTIAL TO THE PROPER AND EFFECTIVE EXERCISE OF THE POWER GRANTED HENCE IT MUST BE EQUALLY TRUE THAT WHEN A STATUTE TAKES AWAY THE POWER TO DO A PARTICULAR THING IT ALSO TAKES AWAY THE POWER TO DO ANYTHING ELSE THE DOING OF WHICH WOULD LEAD TO THE SAME RESULT AND ACCOMPLISH THE SAME OBJECT ATTAINED BY DOING THE PARTICULAR THING FORBIDDEN HENCE TO FOR BID A CARRIER TO CONTRACT FOR EXEMPTION FROM LIABILITY FOR A LOSS CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE IS TO FORBID ITS MAKING A CONTRACT LIMITING SUCH LIABILITY SINCE TO DO THE LATTER WOULD ACCOMPLISH THE FORMER NOT ONLY ARE THE SAYERS CASE AND THE STATUTE AGAINST SUCH A DIS TINCTION BUT MR HUTCHINSON IN PLAIN TERMS NEGATIVES IT IN SEC TIONS 249 AND 250 IN SECTION 249 HE SAS THAT THE AMOUNT1903 CONTRACTS LIMITING CARRIERS LIABILITY 77 MAY BE LIMITED AND IN SECTION 250 HE TELLS US THAT SUCH A LIMITATION IS A PARTIAL EXEMPTION AND HE EXPRESSLY SAYS THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE COURTS HOLD THAT SUCH CONTRACTS WHEN THEY SEEK TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY TO A CERTAIN SUM FOR A LOSS CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE ARE CONTRARY TO PUBLIC POLICY AND THIS DOCTRINE IS SAID TO BE BASED UPON PUBLIC POLICY INDEPENDENT OF ANY STATUTORY ENACTMENT AND INDEED JUDGE LEWIS SAYS THE SAME THING IN JOHNSONS ADMR V R  D R CO3 YET NOTWITHSTANDING THESE APPARENTLY CONCLUSIVE AUTHORITIES BASED UPON PUBLIC POLICY AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE ADDED AUTHOR ITY OF OUR STATUTE THE CARRIERS CONTRACT IN THE CASE OF R  D R CO V PAYNE SUPRA LIMITING THE CARRIERS LIABILITY FOR A LOSS CAUSED BY GROSS NEGLIGENCE WAS UPHELD THE HORSES IN THIS CASE WERE LOST AND IT WAS CONLCEDED THAT THE DAMAGE WAS CAUSED BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE DEFENDANTS AGENTS THE SHIPPER SUED AND THE JURY FIXED THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY AND RENDERED THEIR VERDICT FOR 2485 THE CARRIER AP PEALED AND THE COURT SUSTAINED THE CONTRACT AND HELD THAT THE RECOVERY MUST BE LIMITED BY THE VALUE FIXED IN THE CONTRACT THE RESULT AND EFFECT OF WHICH WAS I RESPECTFULLY MAINTAIN TO LIMIT THE OWNERS RECOVERY TO ISQ THE CONTRACT LIABILITY FOR THE HORSES AND TO EXEMPT THE CARRIER FROM LIABILITY TO THE EX TENT OF 1685 THE COURT SAYS  THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT A COMMON CARRIER CANNOT LAWFULLY STIPULATE FOR EXEMPTION FROM LIABILITY FOR THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS OWN NEGLIGENCE OR THAT OF HIS SERVANTS     BUT THAT IS NOT THE QUESTION BEFORE US THE QUESTION HERE IS WHETHER WHEN THE SHIPPER SIGNS A BILL OF LADING NOT EXEMPTING THE CARRIER FROM LIABILITY FOR THE NEGLIGENCE OF HIMSELF OR HIS SERVANTS BUT LIMITING THE AMOUNT IN WHICH THE CARRIER SHALL BE LIABLE IN CONSIDERATION OF THE GOODS BEING CARRIED AT REDUCED RATES SUCH A CONTRACT FAIRLY ENTERED INTO IS VALID AD BINDING AND WE SEE NO REASON WHY WHEN ITS TERMS ARE JUST AND REASONABLE IT SHOULD NOT BE THE TEST TO BE APPLIED IN ALL SUCH CASES IS WAS THE CONTRACT FAIRLY ENTERED INTO AND ARE ITS TERMS JUST AND REASONABLE  WITH THE GREATEST DEFERENCE FOR THE OPINION OF THE LEARNED JUDGE WHO DELIVERED THIS OPINION IT SEEMS TO ME THAT BY THE VERY TEST FIXED BY THE COURT IN THIS CASE THIS CONTRACT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN UPHELD FOR IT WAS NOT JUST AND REASONABLE ACCORD ING TO THE VERY AUTHORITIES CITED IN THE OPINION HART V PENN R CO4 THE CASE MOST RELIED ON BY THE COURT TO SUPPORT THE DE 386 VA 975 4112 U S 33178 9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER JUNE CISION CITES WITH APPROVAL RAILROAD CO V LOCKWOOD5 AND CITES THIS CASE AS DECIDING THAT IT IS NOT JUST AND REASONABLE IN THE EYE OF THE LAW FOR A COMMON CARRIER TO STIPULATE FOR EXEMPTION FROM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE NEGLIGENCE OF HIMSELF OR HIS SERVANTS DOES THE COURT MLEAN TO SAY THAT IT IS NOT JUST AND REASONABLE FOR A CARRIER TO CONTRACT FOR TOTAL EXEMPTION BUT THAT IT IS JUST AND REASONABLE TO CONTRACT TO LIMIT ITS LIABILITY TO ONETHIRD OF WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HUT FOR THE CONTRACT JUDGE CHRISTIAN ALSO CITES AND QUOTES FROM THE OPINION OF MIR JUSTICE BRADLEY IN RAILROAD V LOCKWOOD0 AS AUTHORITY FOR THE CLECISION IN THE SAYERS CASE AND BEYOND A DOUBT THE LATTER CASE AND THE PAYNE CASE CAN NOT BE RECONCILED UPON REASON OR PRINCIPLE ATTENTION IS CALLED ESPECIALLY TO THE LANGUAGE OF MR JUSTICE BRADLEY IN RAILROAD V LOCKWOOD7 WHERE IT IS SAID THAT THE POSI TION OF THE CARRIER AND THE SHIPPER IS NOT UPOLN A FOOTING OF EQUALITY AND THAT THE CARRIER HAS THE POWER TO DICTATE THE TERMS OF SUCH CONTRACTS CAN IT BE SAID THAT IT IS JUST AND REASONABLE FOR A CARRIER TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS POSITION AND PRACTICALLY HOLD UP TLLE SHIP PER UNTIL HE IS FORCED TO RELEASE THE CARRIER FROM ALL LIABILITY FOR A LOSS CAUSED BY ANYTHING SHORT OF GROSS NEGLIGENIEE AND FRAUD AND UNTIL HE FURTHER AGREES THAT IN THE EVENT OF LOSS BY FRAUD OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE HE WILL DEMANID ONLY A THIRD OF THE ACTUAL LOSS THE COURT SEEMS TO REST THE DECISION UPON THE PRE TENSE MADE IN THE CONATRACT THLAT THE SHIPPER GOT A REDUCED RATE AND TO JUDCGE BY THE AUTHORITIES CITED IN THE OPINION THE COURT ADOPTED THE THEORY THAT THE RATE WAS FIXED BY THE VATLUE BUT IS THIS THEORY SUPPORTED THERE IS NOT A WORD IN THAT CONTRACT TO INDICATE THAT THE RATE WAIS AFFECTED BY THE VALUE PER CONTRA THE CONTRACT SAYS IN TERMS THAT THE REDUCED RATE WAS GIVEN IN ORDER TO GET THE OWNER TO ASSUME AUID RELEASE THE CARRIER FROM ALL INJURY LOSS AND DAMAGE TO THE FULL EXTENT OF THE ACTUAL VALLUE WLHATEVER THAT VALUE MIGHLT BE NOT CAUSED BY GROSS NEGLIGENCE NOW IF THE RATE WAS GRADUATED BY THE VALUATION AS WAS SAID TO HAVE BEEN THE CASE IN FLART V RAILROAD SE PEA WHAT BECOMES OF THE CONSIDERATION TO INDUCE THE OWNER TO ASSUME AIND RELEASE THE CARRIER FROML LIABILITV FOR ALL INJURY LOSS AND DAMIAGE THERE WAS NO SUCLH RELEASE AS THIS IN THE FIAET CASE ON THE CON 517 WALL 357 6 SUPRA 7 STPA1903 CONTRACTS LIMITING CARRIER S LIABILITY 79 TRARY THE CONTRACT THERE ONLY RELEASED THE CARRIER FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE ARISING FROM THE INHERENT NATURE OR VICE OF THE ANIMALS AND SUCH AS WAS BEYOND THE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY AND FOR WHICH THE LAW ITSELF WOULD NOT HAVE HELD THE COMPANY LIABLE8 THERE WAS NO ATTEMPT TO RELEASE THE CARRIER FROM ANY LEGAL LIABIL ITY OR DUTY UNLESS IT WAS IN NAMING AN AGREED VALUATION AS THE LIMIT OF THE LIABILITY ASSUMED BY THE CARRIER AND AS TO THIS THE COURT SAYSS  IT MUST BE PRESUMED FROM THE TERMS OF THE BILL OF LADING AND WITHOUT ANY EVIDENCE ON THE SUBJECT AND ESPECIALLY IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY THAT AS THE RATE OF FREIGHT EXPRESSED IS STATED TO BE ON THE CONDITION THAT THE DEFENDANT ASSUMES A LIABILITY TO THE EXTENT OF THE AGREED VALUATION NAMED THE RATE OF FREIGHT IS GRADUATED BY THE VALUATION IT IS ESTABLISHED BY THE WEIGHT OF AUTHORITY THAT A CARRIER MAY CONTRACT FOR TOTAL EXEMPTION AGAINST ANY LOSS NOT CAUSED BY NEGLI GENCE IT IS LIKEWISE ESTABLISHED THAT IT CANNOT CONTRACT FOR EX EMPTION EITHER TOTAL OR PARTIAL AS TO A LOSS CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF A STATUTE FORBIDDING IT EXCEPT IN THOSE CASES FALLING WITHIN THE PRINCIPLE OF THE ENGLISH CARRIERS ACT AND THE FEDERAL STATUTE REFERRED TO WHICH HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED BY THE COURTS IN THIS COUNTRY AND DISCUSSED BY MR HUTCHINSONI IN SECTION 250 AND WITHIN WHICH CLASS IT WOULCD SEEM THE PAYNE CASE WAS SOUGCHT TO BE RANKED OF SUCH CASES LIMITING THE CARRIERS LIABILITY TO AN AGREED VALUE AMR HUTCHINSON SAYS BUT THE RULE MUIST UNDOUBTEDLV BE CONFINED TO THOSE CASES ONLY WHICH PROPERLY FALL AVITHIN IT WHICHL ARE THOSE IN WHICH AS THE BASIS OF THE CARRIERS CHARGES AND RESPONSIBILITY THE VALUE BEING CALLED IN QUESTION HAS BEEN SO REPRESENTED BY THE SLLIPPER OR SO AGREED UPON BETWEEN HIM AND THE CARRIER AS TO ESTOP THE SHIP PER FROM AFTERWARDS ALLEGING THAT IT WAS MORE AND HE CITES AND PUTS THE HART CASE WITHIN THIS CLASS QULOTING AT LENGTH FROM THE OPINION IN THAT CASE FROM THESE AUTHORITIES THE CORRECT CONCLUSION SEEMS TO BE IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY STATUTE THAT THE SHIPPER WILL ONLY BE BOUND BY THE VALUE STATED IN SUCH A CONTRACT IN THE EVENT OF LOSS BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE CARRIER IN THOSE CASES IN WHICH THE VALLE WAS ACTUALLY AGREED UPON AND MNEASURED ANZD CONTROLLED THE RATE IN WHICH CASE IT WOULD AMOUNT TO A FRAUCL TO PERMIT HIM TO RECOVER A GREATER VALUE IN THE CASE OF LOTTISVILLE R CO V WYNIN9 THE CONTRACT WAS PRE CISELY LIKE THE CLAUSE UPHELD IN THE PAYNE CASE IT DID NOT HAVE 8 HUTCHINSON ON CARRIERS SEES 216217 9 88 TENN 32080 9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER JUNE ANY PROVISION RELEASING THE CARRIER FROM ALL INJURY LOSS AND DAMAGE NOT CAUSED BY GROSS NEGLIGENCE IT PROVIDED SIMPLY THAT IN THE EVENT OF LOSS OR INJURY THE AMOUNT CLAIMED SHOULD NOT EXCEED 100 PER HORSE THE QUESTION RAISED AND DECIDED WAS THE IDENTICAL QUESTION DECIDED IN THE PAYNE CASE THE COURT SAID MANIFESTLY THE STIPULATION DOES NOT CONTEMPLATE TOTAL EXENMPTION FROM LIABILITY IT ONLY PROVIDES FOR PARTIAL OR LIMITED EXEMPTION UPON THAT DISTINC TION THE NICE AND IMPORTANT QUESTION ARISES CAN A STIPULATION OF THE LATTER CHARACTER STAND BEFORE THE LAW WHEN ONE OF THE FORMER CANHIOT  OR TO STATE THE SAINE QUESTION DIFFERENTLY AND SO AS TO APPLY IT MORE DIRECTLY TO THE FACTS OF THIS CASE THE RULE OF LAW BEING ESTABLISHED AS WE HAVE SEEN IT IS THAT THE DEFENDANT COUILD NOT LAWFULLY HLAVE CONTRACTED WITH THE PLAINTIFF THAT IT WOULD IN NO EVENT BE LIABLE FOR ANY PART OF THE VALUE OF THE MARE IF LOST OR DESTROYED CAN THE LIMITATIOII OF ITS LIABILITY TO 100 BE UPHELD IN THE COURTS IF IT SHOULD APPEAR THAT HER DEATH RESULTED FROM THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE CORNPANY AND THAT SHE WAS IN FACT WORTH EIGHT TIMES THE AMOUNT AS THE JURY FOUND HER TO BE  WE UN HESITATINGLY ANSWER NO THE CARRIER CANNOT BY CONTRACT EXCUSE ITSELF FROM LIABILITY FOR THE WHOLE OR ANY PART OF A LOSS BROUGLHT ABOUT BY ITS NEGLIGENCE TO OUR MIND IT IS PERFECTLY CLEAR THAT THE TWO KINDS OF STIPULATIONTHAT PROVIDING FOR TOTAL AND THAT PRO VIDING FOR PARTIAL EXEMPTION FROM LIABILITY FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE CARRIERS NEGLIGENCESTAND UPON THE SAME GROUND AND MUST BE TESTED BY THE SAME PRIN CIPLES IF ONE CAN BE ENFORCED THE OTHER CAN IF EITHER BE INVALID BOTH MUST BE HELD TO BE SO THE SAME CONSIDERATIONS OF PUBLIC POLICY OPERATING IN EACH CASE AWITLH GREAT DEFERENCE FOR THOSE WHO MAY DIFFER V ITH UIS WE TLHINK IT ENTIRELY ILLOGICAL AND UNREASONABLE TO SAY THAT THE CARRIER MAY NOT ABSOLVE ITSELF FROM LIABILITY FOR THE WLHOLE VALUE OF PROPERTY LOST OR DE ROYED THROUGLH ITS NEGLIGENCE BUT TLLAT IT MAY ABSOLVE ITSELF FROM RESPONSIBILITY FOR ONEHALF THREEFOURTHS SEVENEIGLHTHS NINETENTHS OR NINETYHUNDREDTHS OF THE LOSS SO OCCASIONED NOTE 2 TO SEC 250 HUTCHINSON ON CARRIERS THIS CASE ALSO CITES IHART V RAILROAD CO SUPRA AND SHOWS THAT IT IS NOT IN CONFLICT WITH THE VIEWS EXPRESSED AND THIS CASE IS NOT RESTED UPON ANY STATUTE BUT UPON PUBLIC POLICY AND IT IS SUPPOSED THAT THERE WAS NO STATUTE APPLYING OR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN REFERRED TO YET IN OUR COURT A CONTRACT MUCH MORE OBNOXIOUS TO PUBLIC POLICY IS UPHELD NOTWITHSTANDING WE HAVE A STATUTE DE CLARING CONTRACTS EXEMPTING CARRIERS FROM LIABILITY FOR LOSSES CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE TO BE VOID SUCH A CONTRACT HAS NOT BEEN BEFORE OUR COURT OF APPEALS SINCE THE DECISION IN THE PAYNE CASE AND LITTLE LIGHT HAS BEEN THROWN ON THIS PARTICULAR QUESTION SINCE THAT TIME IN LN  TV R CO V HARMANA10 IT IS SAID THAT A COMMON CARRIER CANNOT CONTRACT FOR EXEMPTION FROM LIABILITY FOR INJURY OR LOSS CAUSED BY ITS OWN NEGLECT ITALICS MINE 10 91 VA 6011903 CONTRACTS LIMITING CARRIERS LIABILITY 81 THIS DOES NOT COVER THE QUESTION HERE DISCUSSED IN C  0 1 CO V BANKS1 IT IS HELD THAT FAILURE TO PROVIDE PROPER FACILITIES FOR LOADING AND UNLOADING CATTLE IS NEGLIGENCE AGAINST WHICH A COMMON CARRIER IS NOT PERMITTED TO CONTRACT AND THERE WAS A CONTRACT IN THIS CASE EXEMPTING THE CARRIER FROM ALL LIABILITY EX CEPT SUCH AS WAS INCURRED BY GROSS NEGLIGENCE BOTH CASES CITE OUR STATUTE SECTION 1296 IN THE EVENT THAT SUCH A CON TRACT AS WAS BEFORE THE COURT IN THE PAYNE CASE COMES BEFORE THE PRESENT COURT WILL THEY FOLLOW OR OVERRULE THAT CASE IF THIS DECISION IS BINDING AUTHORITY IN THIS STATE THEN THERE IS NO DOUBT BUT THAT A CARRIER MAY BY A CONTRACT RECITING THAT IT GIVES A REDUCED RATE OF FREIGHT LIMIT ITS LIABILITY FOR A LOSS CAUSED BY GROSS NEGLIGENCE TO ANY EXTENT WHICH FALLS SHORT OF TOTAL EXEMPTION THE VERY STATEMENT THAT THE RATE IS A REDUCED RATE RAISES THE PRESUMPTION THAT IT IS NOT BASED UPON THE VALUATION OUT IS GIVEN FOR THE IMMUNITY FROM LIABILITY WHERE SUCH IMNMUNITY IS PROVIDED FOR A RATE THAT IS BASED ON VALUATION CANNOT BE A REDUCED RATE FOR THE MOMENT THAT THE VALUE IS FIXED THIS ESTABLISHES A FIXED AND REGULAR RATE FOR THAT PARTICULAR VALUE ACCORDING TO THE GRADUATED SCALE F RATES AND A RATE THUS ESTALAISHED IS IN NO SENSE A REDUCED RATE THERE WAS NOT A WORD IN THE CONTRACT IN THE H1ART CASE ABOUT REDUCED RATES AND THE CASE WAS CLEARLY WITHIN THE PRINCIPLE AS THE COURT EXPRESSLY STATED APPLICABLE TO THOSE CASES WHERE THERE IS AN AGREED VALUATION AND THE RATE IS MEASURED BY THIS VALUATION AND SUCH CONTRACTS ARE IN NO SENSE CONTRACTS FOR IMMUNITY FROM LIAOILITY FOR NEGLIGENCE FOR THE CARRIER IS LIABLE BY THE VERY TERMS OF THE CONTRACT FOR THE AGREED VALUE AND THIS VALUE IS CONSIDERED THE ACTUAL VALUE BECAUSE IT WOULD BE A FRAUD TO MAKE THIS VALUE MEASURE THE CARRIERS HIRE AND THEN ADOPT A HIGHER VALUE TO MEASURE HIS LIABILITY IN THE EVENT OF LOSS IT THEREFORE SEEMS CLEAR THAT THE GIVING OF A VALU ABLE CONSIDERATION THE REDUCED RATE CANNOT POSSIBLY MAKE VALID A CONTRACT FORBIDDEN BY EITHER PUBLIC POLICY OR BY STATUTE AND WHICH BUT FOR THE CONSIDERATION WOULD BE CONFESSEDLY VOID WE ALL KNOW THAT AS A MATTER OF FACT VALUE WITHIN ITSELFIS RARELY A MATERIAL FACTOR IN FIXING THE RATE FOR FREIGHT THOUGH IT IS OFTEN THE MATERIAL ELEMENT IN FIXING EXPRESS RATES THIS IS PROVED BY AN EXAMINATION OF THE VIRGINIA STATUTES ON THIS SUBJECT 11 92 VA 49582 9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER JUNE SECTIONS 1202 1215 AND 1219 FROM WHICH IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THE ONLY INSTANCES IN WHICH THE LAW REGARDS OR MAKES THE VALUE THE MATERIAL FACTOR IN FIXING THE RATES ARE IN THE CARRIAGE OF COIN BUL LION BANK NOTES BILLS OF EXCHANGE PROMISSORY NOTES OR OTHER EVI DENCES OF DEBT FOR THE CARRIAGE OF WHICH EXPRESS COMPANIES ARE ALLOWED TO CHARGE NOT EXCEEDING ONETENTH OF ONE PER CENT OF THE VALUE OF THE SAME FOR EVERY ONE HUNDRED MILES THE OFFICIAL CLASS IFICATION OF RATES OF ALL CARRIERS PROVES THE SAME THING COIN BUL LION BANK NOTES AND SUCH VALUABLES ARE NOT TAKEN OR CLASSI FIED BY FREIGHT CARRIERS OF COURSE IF A CONTRACT PROVIDING EXEMPTION TOTAL OR PARTIAL FROM LIABILITY FOR NEGLIGENCE IS VOID THEN THE ASSENT OF THE SHIPPER WHETHER EVIDENCED BY HIS SIGNING THE CONTRACT OR BY MERE ACCEPT ANCE IS IMMATERIAL BUT ASSUMING THAT SULCH A CONTRACT MAY BE VALID UNDER THE DECISION IN THE PAYNE CASE THE NEXT QUESTION THAT ARISES IS HOW IS THE FACT OF THE MAKING OF SUCH CONTRACT TO BE ESTAB LISHED  MIERE ACCEPTANCE OF BILL OF LADING CONTAINING THE EXEMPTION WILL NOT BIND THE SHIPPER UNDER VIRGINIA LAW ALL THE AUTHORITIES AGREE THAT THERE MUST BE ASSENT ON THE PART OF THE SHIPPER FOR IT IS A CONTRACT AND AIR IAYTHE STATES IN THE ARTICLE REFERRED TO SUPRA THAT THIS ASSENT MAY BE IMPLIED BY THE MERE ACCEPTANCE OF THE BILL OF LADING AND THAT IT NEED NOT BE SIGNED BY HIM I CONCEDE THAT THIS IS ESTABLISHED BY THE WEIGHT OF AUTHOR ITY IN THE UNITED STATES AS TO CONTRACTS WHICH CAN BE LAWFULLY MADE BLUT I DO THINK IT WOULD NOT BE SO HELD IN THIS STATE ASTO ANY SUCH CONTRACT THE EXACT QUESTION HAS NEVER BEEN BEFORE THE COURT AND HENCE THE QUESTION HAS NEVER BEEN EXPRESSLY RULED ON HERE TREATING IT THEREFORE AS AN OPEN QUESTION IN THIS STATE TO BE DE CIDED UPON REASON PRINCIPLE AND PUBLIC POLICY RATHER THAN UPON THE MERE BALANCING OF THE WEIGHT OF AUTHORITY PRO AND CON IT IS TO MY MIND CLEAR THAT SUCH CONTRACTS IF THEY ARE TO BE UPHELD AT ALL SHOULD ONLY BE ENFORCED AGAINST THE SHIPPER IN THOSE CASES WHERE KNOWLEDGE OF AND ASSENT TO THE STIPULATIONS AND CONDITIONS ON HIS PART IS PROVED BY HIS SIGNING THE PAPER FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS FIRST IT IS THE DUTY OF THE CARRIER UPON DEMAND TO ISSUE DUPLI CATE FREIGHT RECEIPTS TO SHIPPERS IN WVHICH SHALL BE STATED THE CLASS OR CLASSES OF FREIGHT SHIPPED AND THE FREIGHT CHARGES OVER THE ROAD GIVING THE RECEIPT ACTS 18912 CH 614 SEC 7 THE SHIPPER1903 CONTRACTS LIMITING CARRIER S LIABILITY 83 HAS THE LEGAL RIGHT TO DEMAND THIS RECEIPT WITHOUT BEING SUBJECTED TO TERMS CONDITIONS OR BEING REQUIRED TO CONTRACT FOR IT HE ALSO HAS THE RIGHT TO PRESUME WITHOUT READING THE RECEIPT THAT IT IS WHAT THE LAW REQUIRES TO BE DELIVERED TO HIM AND NOTHING MORE THIS ALONE SEEMS TO ME TO BE SUFFICIENT TO REPEL ASSENT ON HIS PART TO ANY OTHER CONTRACT THAN THAT CREATED BY THE LAW BY THE MERE DE LIVERY OF THE GOODS BY THE SHIPPER AND THE DELIVERY OF THE RECEIPT BY THE CARRIER AND TO PUT UPON THE CARRIER THE BURDEN OF SHOWING THE SHIPPERS ASSENT TO AN ADDITIONLAL CONTRACT BY SOME ADDITIONAL FACT OTHER THAN HIS MERE ACCEPTANCE OF THE RECEIPT FOR IT IS PLAIN THAT MERE ACCEPTANCE OF THE RECEIPT WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN DELIVERED AND ACCEPTED AS A RECEIPT FOR THE GOODS IN ANY EVENT IS PERFECTLY CONSISTENT WITH THE THEORY THAT A SPECIAL CONTRACT WAS NZOT MADE IT IS NO ANSWER TO SAY THAT THE SHIPPER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY AND WAS UNDER THE DUTY TO READ HIS RECEIPT 1 BECAUSE A SHIPPER HAS THE RIGHT TO RELY UPON THE PRESUMPTION THAT THE CARRIER HAS GIVEN HIM THE RECEIPT WHICH HE WAS ENTITLED TO HAVE AND THE CARRIER WAS BOUND TO DELIVER AND ESPECIALLY IS HE ENTITLED TO PRESUME THAT THE CARRIER WILL INSERT NOTHING IN HIS RECEIPT TO HIS PREJUDLICE 2 BECAUSE TO SAY THAT THE SHIPPER MIGHT HAVE READ THE RECE PT IS TO BIND HIM BY CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE OF A THING AS TO WHICH THEFE WAS NOTHING TO PUT HIM UPON INQUIRY AND NOTHING MAKING IT HIS LEGAL DUTY TO INQUIRE THE DUTY ACCORDING TO REASON JUSTICE AND PRIINCIPLE WOULD BE UPON THE CARRIER TO GIVE ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE TO THE SHIPPER THAT HIS RECEIPT CONTAINED LIMITATIONS UPON ITS LEGAL LIABILITIES ALL THE AUTHORITIES AS TO CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE ARE TO THE EFFECT THAT IT WVILL NEVER BE IM PUTED WHERE THERE WAS NO LEGAL DUTY TO ASCERTAIN THE FACT AND NOTHING TO PUT THE PARTY SOUGHT TO BE BOUND UPON INQUIRY SECOND IT IS AGAINST SOUND PUBLIC POLICY FOR THE REASONS STATED IN RTAILROAD CO V LOCKWOOD SUPRA THE CONTRACTS BEING WITHIN THEMSELVES IN DEROGATION OF THE LAW AND AGAINST PULBLIC POLICY THE EVIDENCE TO ESTABLISH THEM SHOULD BE THE BEST OF WHICH THE NATURE OF THE TRANSACTION IS CAPABLE AND OF SUCH A CHARACTER AS TO REDUCE THE POWER OF THE CARRIER TO ABUSE THE RIGHT TO A MINIMUM AND NOTHING WILL ACCOMPLISH THIS AS EFFECTIVELY AS REQUIRING SUCH CONTRACTS TO BE SIGNED BY THE SHIPPER AND NOTHING COULD GIVE THE CARRIER BETTER OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPOSITION AND ABUSE OF ITS POWER THAN TO PERMIT SUCH CONTRACTS TO IE ESTABLISHED BY MERE ACCEPTANCD THIRD IT IS THE LEGISLATIVE POLICY IN THIS STATE TO REQUIRE CON TRACTS RELEASING CARRIERS FROM THEIR LEGAL LIABILITIES TO BE SIGNED84 9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER JUNE EVEN AS TO MATTERS FOR WHICH THEY WOULD NOT BE LIABLE AT COMMON LAW CODE SEC 1295 IS THERE ANY REASON FOR REQUIRING THE RELEASE OF THIS PURELY STATUTORY LIABILITY TO BE SIGNED WHICH WOULD NOT APPLY WITH EQUAL FORCE AS TO AN EXEMUPTION OR RELEASE OF A COM MON LAW LIABILITY FOURTH IN ALL THE VIRGINIA DECISIONS IN SO FAR AS THEY SHED ANY LIGHT ON THE SUBJECT AT ALL OR INDICATE AN OPINION IT IS TO THE EFFECT THAT ALL SUCH CONTRACTS MUST BE SIGNED BY THE SHIPPER IN THE PAYNE CASE THE CONTRACT BEING SIGNED THIS QUESTION OR COURSE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN RAISED BUT IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT THE PRESI DENT OF THE COURT WAS OF OPINION THAT SUCH CONTRACTS SHOULD BE SIGNED THE INFERENCE FRONM WHBT HE SAID BEING THAT SUCH CONTRACTS WOULD BE UPHELD ONLY WHEN THE SHIPPER SIGNS THE BILL OF LADING SUPRA IN NY  WT R CO V IHARMAN AND C  0 R CO V BANK2 THERE WERE SUCH CONTRACTS BUT IT DOES NOT APPEAR WHETHER THEY WERE SIGNED BY THE SHIPPER OR NOT IT IS FAIR TO PRESUME THAT THEV WERE FOR THE CARRIERS RELIED ON THE CONTRACTS IN BOTH CASES TO DEFEAT RE COVERY AND HAD THEY NOT BEEN SIGNED THE QUESTION WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN RAISED AND DISPOSED OF SOME WAY OR REFERRED TO IN THE OPINION OF THE COURT THE NEXT CASE FALLS LITTLE SHORT OF A DECISION OF THE POINT AND IS CERTAINLY AN EXPRESSION OF OPINION ALMOST ON THE VERY QUESTION IT IS THE CASE OF R  A R CO V PATTERSON TOBACCO CO IN THIS CASE IN DELIVERING THE OPINION JUDGE KEITH SAYS THAT THE STATUTE SECTION 1295 ESTABLISHES A RULE OF EVIDENCE FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROTECTING SHIPPERS FROM IMPOSITION AS JUSTIFYING SUCH A RULE HE GIVES THE FOLLOWING REASON  IT HAS THEREFORE COME TO PASS THAT BILLS OF LADING LIKE POLICIES OF INSURANCE HAVE BEEN EXPANDED INTO CUMBROUS DOCUMENTS IN WHICH THE LIABILITY OF THE CARRIER IS HEDGED ABOUT BY ALMOST ININUMERABLE EXCEPTIONS CONDITIONS AND EXEMPTIONS TO WHICH NO ONE OUGHT TO BE BOUND UNTIL THEY HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO HIS KNOWLEDGE AND ATTENTION AND HAVE RECEIVED HIS INTELLIGENT APPROVAL ANOTHER DECISION WHICH COMES VERY NEAR DECIDING THE IDENTICAL QUESTION AND IS ALMOST A CONCLUSIVE AUTHORITY IS WESTERN UN TEL CO V POWELL14 THAT WAS AN ACTION UNDER THE STATUTE FOR FAILING TO DELIVER A MESSAGE AMONG OTHER THINGS THE DEFENDANT COMPANY RELIED UPON CERTAIN STIPULATIONS PRINTED UPON THE MESSAGE BLANK UPON WHICH THE MESSAGE WAS WRITTEN EXEMPTING IT FROM LIABILITY JUDGE BUCHANAN AS TO THIS SAID  THE RECORD DOES NOT SHOW THAT THE DEFENDANT IN ANY WAY RESTRICTED ITS GENERAL 12SUPRA 13 92 VA 670 14 94 VA 2681903 DUE PROCESS OF LAW AND THE TORRENS SYSTEM 85 LIABILITY FOR THE SERVICE WHICH IT UNDERTOOK TO RENDER AND IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH A CONTRACT IT CANNOT RELY UPON THE CONDITIONS OF THE MESSAGE BLANK UPON WHICH WAS WRITTEN THE MESSAGE DELIVERED TO THE TELEGRAPH COMPANY FOR TRANSMISSION THE PLAINTIFF DID NOT SIGN THAT BLANK NOR DID HE AUTHORIZE ANY ONE ELSE TO DO SO FOR HIM THE PLAINTIFF WAS THE SENDER OF THE MESSAGE FOR THESE REASONS AND UNDER THE FOREGOING AUTHORITIES I CON FIDENTLY SUBMIT THAT EVEN GRANTING THAT A COMMON CARRIER MAY CON TRACT FOR PARTIAL EXEMPTION FROM ITS LIABILITY FOR A LOSS CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE YET IN ORDER TO DO SO THE BURDEN WILL BE UPON IT TO SHOW THAT THE SHIPPER ASSENTED TO SUCH A CONTRACT AND THAT THE MERE ACCEPTANCE BY THE SHIPPER OF THE CARRIERS RECEIPT IS NO EVIDENCE IN THIS STATE OF SUCH ASSENT BUT THE CARRIER MUST SHOW ACTUAL KNOWL EDGE OF THE SHIPPER OF THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT AT THE TIME OF THE ACCEPTANCE AND THAT THE ONLY PROPER WAY TO SHOW SUCH KNOWLEDGE IS BY PROVING THAT THE CONTRACT WAS SIGNED BY THE SHIPPER TAZEWELL VA WM H WERTH

j100010,The American Historical Review,1836728,Historical News,i304918,HISTORICAL NEWS After twenty years existence of this Review its readers may be in terested in a classified statement of the fields in which its many articles have lain Following some such classification as that which has ob tained in its section devoted to items of news one may say that of 397 articles 48 have been general in their nature chiefly the annual ad dresses of the presidents of the American Historical Association and the accounts of its meetings that there have been ii articles in ancient history I9 in medieval history 29 in modern meaning articles in medi eval and modern history not preferably classified under single countries 6i in the history of Great Britain and Ireland 30 in that of France i6 in that of Italy or Spain 9 in that of Germany Austria or Switzer land 4 in that of Northern and Eastern Europe 4 in that of the Far East The articles in American history may be classified as follows general i8 economic 12 diplomatic 8 naval I colonial and Revo lutionary 30 constitutional and political history of 1783i86i 43 of the period of the Civil War and Reconstruction I7 New England 5 Middle Colonies or States 8 South 8 West IO Canada and Spanish America 6 Too much stress should not be laid upon these details for at least a third of the articles are of debatable classification but the list has its significance as indicative of the interests of American historical writers Equally significant data are however concealed in the larger items Thus it is a strange and not wholly creditable fact that out of nearly 400 articles only 8 have related to the history of Europe since I8I5 and that of the many articles in British history only ii have related to the eighteenth century and only one to the nineteenth AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION The thirtyfirst annual meeting of the American Historical Associa tion will take place in Washington on December 283I I9I5 four days

invasion and occupation and a French translation of the Italian Green Book are issued by Hachette of Paris The elimination of the correspondent and the dry brevity of the daily official commitniques make it wellnigh impossible for the general reader to visualize for himself in anything like a clear and comprehensive way what is actually going on over a small section of the enormously ex tended front Accordingly there has been attached to the British head quarters in France an official chronicler whose duty it is to prepare for the public narrative and descriptive accounts based upon personal ob servation or compiled from reports of the operations of the British army These accounts which have appeared from time to time in the press are now gathered together in a small volume Eye

much of interest in La Guerre Allemande dAgadir a Sarajevo I9II I9I4 by Pierre Albin Paris Felix Alcan T9I5 pp XV 256 The author is of the opinion that since the establishment of the German Empire that power has mainly sought to prepare itself to take ad vantage of the propitious moment for imposing its leadership by force of arms upon Europe and that since the incident of Agadir in I9II this

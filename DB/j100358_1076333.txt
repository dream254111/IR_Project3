TO THE TEACHER 36 ADD ANY INFORMATION THAT YOU THINK IS NOT COVERED BY THESE QUESTIONS DEFINITION FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS INVESTIGATION A  DELINQUENT  IS A PUPIL WHO FAILS OF PROMOTION THIS TERM INCLUDING ANY WHO HAVE LEFT DURING THE TERM BECAUSE OF INABILITY TO DO THE WORK FIRST LET US CONSIDER THE PUPIL AS HE APPEARS ON THE SCHOOL RECORDS THE LARGEST PERCENTAGE OF FAILURES IN PROPORTION TO THE TOTAL ENROLMENT FOR GRADE PUPILS WAS IN THE SEVENTH GRADE7 PER CENT THE SMALLESTIN THE EIGHTH24 PER CENT THE FIFTH GRADE SHOWS 5 PER CENT THE SIXTH 52 PER CENT WHILE FROM CONDITIONS WHICH MAKE THIS CITY AN IDEAL ONE IN MANY RESPECTS THESE PERCENT AGES ARE NOT VERY STARTLING YET THEY MAKE A PROBLEM WELL WORTHY OF INVESTIGATION THESE PROPORTIONS ARE FURTHER EMPHASIZED BY THE FOLLOWING FIGURES OF THOSE WHO ANSWERED OUR QUESTIONS SEVENTH GRADE 33 PER CENT EIGHTH 12 PER CENT FIFTH 27 PER CENT SIXTH 28 595THE SCHOOL REVIEW PER CENT THAT THE LARGEST NUMBER IS IN THE SEVENTH MAY BE EX PLAINED BY THE AGE OF THE CHILD IN THAT GRADE AND THE BEGINNING OF HIS REAL DIFFICULTIES ATTENDING STUDY AND APPLICATION IT APPEARS THAT LITTLE RESPONSIBILITY OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL IS REQUIRED OF THE PUPIL BEFORE THE SEVENTH GRADE IS REACHED AND THEN THAT THERE IS NOT THAT DEFINITE RESPONSIBILITY WHICH MIGHT LEAD TO BETTER PREPARATION FOR THE WORK IN HIGH SCHOOL FOR THE HIGHSCHOOL STUDENTS THE PERCENTAGE OF FAILURES ON THE PART OF STUDENTS REPORTING IS AS FOLLOWS AI2 I PER CENT BI2 2 PER CENT AI  5 PER CENT BII 13 PER CENT AIO 8 PER CENT BIO I6 PER CENT A9 20 PER CENT BG 35 PER CENT OF THE TOTAL ENROL MENT IN THE HIGH SCHOOLS DURING THE SEMESTER 15 PER CENT OF THE FIRSTYEAR PUPILS FAILED IO PER CENT OF THE SECOND 14 PER CENT OF THE THIRD AND IO PER CENT OF THE FOURTH AGAIN ALTHOUGH THE SITUATION IN THE HIGH SCHOOLS IS WORSE THAN THAT IN THE GRADES THE FIGURES ARE NOT STARTLING HOWEVER IF WE CAN REDUCE THESE PERCENTAGES BY GETTING AT THE ROOT OF THE TROUBLE CLEARLY OUR DUTY IS TO DO IT THE QUESTION WHICH COMES NEXT ON OUR QUESTIONNAIRE HAD TO DO WITH THE COMPARATIVE DIFFICULTY OF SUBJECTS IN THE GRADES WE FIND THAT ARITHMETIC SEEMS TO BE THE GREAT STUMBLINGBLOCK THE PRINCIPAL SUBJECTS STATED IN ORDER OF DIFFICULTY THE GREATEST APPEAR ING FIRST ARE AS FOLLOWS ARITHMETIC GRAMMAR ENGLISH HISTORY LANGUAGE AND GEOGRAPHY ARITHMETIC APPEARS TO BE VERY DECIDEDLY THE MOST DIFFICULT GRAMMAR A POOR SECOND AND ENGLISH A VERY POOR THIRD IN THE HIGH SCHOOL THE ORDER OF DIFFICULTY IS AS FOLLOWS ALGEBRA ENGLISH LANGUAGE GEOMETRY AND HISTORY VERY FEW MEN TION SCIENCE THAT REGULARITY OF ATTENDANCE AND CONTINUANCE IN ONE GOOD SCHOOL ARE FIRST AIDS TO EFFICIENT WORK HAS BEEN AXIOMATIC WITH EDU CATORS OF 380 PUPILS QUIZZED ON THE FIRST POINT 80 TESTIFY THAT THEY HAVE BEEN IRREGULAR IN ATTENDANCE THE FOLLOWING TABLE IS INTEREST ING NUMBER OF SCHOOLS NUMBER OF PUPILS ATTENDED REPLYING 3  79 4  30 5 I5 6                7 7                                           I 596THE CAUSES OF STUDENT DELINQUENCY THAT IS TO SAY 132 STUDENTS HAVE ATTENDED THREE OR MORE DIFFERENT SCHOOLS IN MINNEAPOLIS THIS TABLE AS TO THE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS ATTENDED IS NO LESS ENLIGHTENING NUMBER OF SYSTEMS NUMBER REPLYING 2 6I 3 27 4  8 5  6 THUS ELIMINATING THE NUMBER ENROLLED IN TWO DIFFERENT SYSTEMS WE HAVE 4I OR ABOUT IO PER CENT OF THE TOTAL NUMBER IN THE INQUIRY WHO HAVE BEEN ENROLLED IN THREE OR MORE SYSTEMS IT MAY BE PERTI NENT TO REMARK THAT WHILE ANY SCHOOL SYSTEM WORTHY OF THE NAME KEEPS THE WORK IN ITS SCHOOLS OF THE SAME GENERAL TYPE THERE ARE DIFFERENCES OF METHOD AND ASSOCIATIONS THAT MAKE EVEN CHANGES WITHIN THE CITY OFTEN DETRIMENTAL TO A CHILD IT IS FAR MORE EVI DENT THAT SHIFTING FROM TOWN TO TOWN MAKES FOR RETARDATION SO FOREIGN IS THE TONGUE THAT THE STRANGE BOY OR GIRL HEARS IN THE NEW CLASSROOM A MOVE TO COORDINATE THE WORK OF THE VARIOUS SCHOOL SYSTEMS WOULD DO MUCH TO PREVENT RETARDATION AND CONSE QUENT WASTE THE NEXT TOPIC IS THE AVERAGE TIME SPENT IN PREPARATION OF LESSONS OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL IT APPEARS FROM REPORTS THAT THOSE WHO FAILED IN THE GRADES DEVOTED FROM ONEHALF TO ONE HOUR AT HOME TO THEIR WORK THIS IS NOT STARTLING AS THOSE WHO PASSED PROBABLY DID LITTLE MORE BUT IN THE HIGH SCHOOL A DIFFERENT SITUATION CON FRONTS US IF REPORTS ARE TO BE BELIEVED A LARGE PROPORTION OF THOSE WHO FAILED DEVOTED TWO TO FOUR HOURS OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL TO THEIR WORK WHILE ONLY I2 PER CENT OF THE FAILURES WERE CONTENT WITH ONE HOFUR OR LESS I THINK IT IS SETTLED IN THE MINDS OF ALL OF EXPERIENCE WHO HAVE LOOKED INTO THIS MATTER ESPECIALLY PRINCIPALS WHO COME INTO CONTACT WITH ALL CLASSES THAT THE LARGEST PROPORTION OF FAILURES IS DUE TO LACK OF EFFORT ON THE PART OF THOSE WHO GIVE ENOUGH TIME THE DIFFICULTY IS DUE TO LACK OF KNOWLEDGE AS TO HOW TO STUDY AND HOW TO USE THEIR TIME TO ADVANTAGE THE REMEDY IN THE LATTER CASE OF COURSE IS DEFINITE INSTRUCTION TO INDIVIDUALS AND CLASSES AS TO METHODS OF STUDY PARTICULARLY CAREFULNESS IN GIVING OUT LESSONS AND THE ASSURANCE THAT PUPILS HAVE A DEFINITE IDEA OF WHAT IS REQUIRED 597THE SCHOOL REVIEW BEFORE THEY BEGIN THEIR WORK LITTLE CAN BE EXPECTED OF PUPILS TO WHOM THE LESSON IS GIVEN AS THE CLASS PASSES FROM THE ROOM ESPE CIALLY IF IT INVOLVES CERTAIN DEVELOPMENT AND EXPLANATION WHERE A PROPER FOUNDATION IS TO BE LAID WEAK PHYSICAL CONDITIONS IS THE LAST GENERAL TOPIC ASSIGNED IN THE GRADES WE FIND FROM OUR BEST INFORMATION THAT OF THE FAILURES REPORTED 3 PER CENT WERE CLASSED AS WEAK PHYSICALLY AND IN THE HIGH SCHOOL ABOUT 7 PER CENT THE CONDITIONS INVOLVED IN THIS CLASS VARY SO GREATLY THAT IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO TAKE THE TIME TO DISCUSS THEM THIS IS OF COURSE THE UNFORTUNATE GROUP FOR THEIR CON DITION WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE PRIMARILY WE HAVE A DEFINITE DUTY TO SEE THAT THEY ARE BROUGHT UNDER PHYSICAL INSPECTION WHEN WE KNOW HOW TO PRESENT IN THE PROPER WAY THE REALLY NECESSARY LAWS OF HYGIENE WE SHALL REMEDY GREATER DIFFICULTIES THAN NOW EXIST II REPORT OF SUBCOMMIIIEE ON HOME CONDITIONS E DUDLEY PARSONS WEST HIGH SCHOOL MINNEAPOLIS THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON HOME CONDITIONS ENTERED UPON ITS TASK WITH MORE HOPE THAN ITS FRIENDS THOUGHT JUSTIFIABLE TO GET DEFINITE ANSWERS TO SUCH PERSONAL QUESTIONS AS THE COMMITTEE BELIEVED OUGHT TO BE ASKED WAS THESE FRIENDS SAID IMPOSSIBLE EVEN IF TEACHERS ALREADY WORRIED BY VARIOUS INVESTIGATIONS WOULD CONSENT TO MAKE THE INQUIRIES THEN AFTER CERTAIN RESULTS HAD BEEN OBTAINED WHAT REASONABLY COULD BE ARGUED CON CERNING THE RELATION OF THESE RESULTS TO DELINQUENCY  WOULD NOT A SIMILAR INSPECTION OF PASSING STUDENTS REVEAL NEARLY THE SAME SITUATION DESPITE THESE SUGGESTIONS OF FAILURE HOWEVER THE COMMITTEE HAS PRESSED ON IN THE FAITH THAT IF ONLY IT COULD GIVE POINT TO THE WIDE GENERALIZATIONS EVOKED BY CONSTANT OBSERVATION AND CASUAL QUESTIONING OF STUDENTS BY PRESENTING A FEW SIGNIFICANT FACTS SOME GOOD MIGHT COME OF ITS EFFORTS BUT THESE EFFORTS HAVE YIELDED PERHAPS MORE THAN THE COMMITTEE HAD A RIGHT TO EXPECT IN GENERAL THE CRITICISM OF HOME LIFE THAT MINISTERS JOURNALISTS TRAVELERS AND OTHER OBSERVERS OF OUR NATIONAL 598THE CAUSES OF STUDENT DELINQUENCY TENDENCIES ARE MAKING IS SUBSTANTIATED BY THIS REPORT ON SOME POINTS TO BE SURESUCH AS THE CONTENTION THAT MANY PARENTS ARE HABITUALLY AWAY FROM HOMETHE COMMITTEE CANNOT HOLD WITH THESE CRITICS BUT TO THE PROPOSITION THAT THE HOME LACKS SERIOUSNESS OF PURPOSE WHICH IT MUST GET IF OUR NATION IS TO INCREASE IN INTELLECTUAL AND MORAL STATURE THESE FINDINGS ADD TESTIMONY FIRST OF ALL THAT ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CHANGE IN OUR LIFE IS TEND ING TO SCATTER THE FAMILY AND SO HINDER BOYS AND GIRLS FROM THE THOUGHTFUL DEVELOPMENT THAT A FAMILY CIRCLE SUGGESTS IS A COMMON SAYING TO TEST THE TRUTH OF IT THESE QUESTIONS WERE ASKED OF DELINQUENT STUDENTS I ON HOW MANY MORNINGS IN A WEEK DOES YOUR FAMILY EAT BREAKFAST TOGETHER  2 HOW MANY TIMES A WEEK DO THEY EAT THE EVENING MEAL TOGETHER 3 HOW MANY EVENINGS IN A WEEK IS YOUR FATHER AWAY FROM HOME ON HOW MANY EVENINGS OR AFTERNOONS IS YOUR MOTHER AWAY BOTH TOGETHER 4 ON HOW MANY ENTIRE EVENINGS IN A WEEK ARE YOU AT HOME  5 HOW OFTEN IS COMPANY ENTERTAINED IN YOUR HOME  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS HOW THE 379 AND 375 RESPECTIVELY WHO REPLIED TO THE FIRST TWO QUESTIONS WERE DISTRIBUTED DAYS IN WEEK BREAKFAST EVENING MEAL O  96 4  55 8 2  I6 8 3  5 5 4  4 4 5  6 9 6 12 30 7  65 270 TOTALS  379 375 IT WILL BE SEEN THAT APPROXIMATELY 50 PER CENT OF THESE FAMILIES EAT TOGETHER ONLY HALF THE BREAKFASTS IN A WEEK THAT I6 PER CENT ARE TOGETHER BUT ONCE AND 26 PER CENT LARGELY FAMILIES OF TRAVELING MEN ARE NEVER ASSOCIATED AT THE MORNING MEAL IN MANY OF THESE HOMES CHILDREN EVEN THOSE WHO SHOULD REPORT AT SCHOOL ALMOST AS EARLY AS THEIR ELDERS REPORT AT THE SHOP OFFICE OR STORE ARE PER MITTED TO SLEEP LATE AND THEN TO SNATCH SCRAPS OF FOOD INSTEAD OF 599THE SCHOOL REVIEW BEING PERSUADED TO SIT SOBERLY WITH THEIR PARENTS AT THE TABLE THUS THEY NOT ONLY MISS GOOD TRAINING IN PUNCTUALITY IN FORMAL CON VERSATION AND IN DELIBERATION BUT THEY ACTUALLY INJURE THEIR HEALTH BESIDES NEITHER IS TO BE LIGHTLY TAKEN THAT I5 PER CENT OF THE FAMILIES ENUMERATED ARE TOGETHER FOR LESS THAN HALF THE EVENING MEALS IN A WEEK AND THAT 12 PER CENT FOR REASONS GOOD OR BAD NEVER ENJOY THIS COMMUNION ONCE BELIEVED TO BE THE RIGHT OF EVERY FAMILY AND CERTAINLY NEEDED MORE IN THIS BUSY WORLD THAN IT WAS IN THE QUIETER ONE OF OUR FATHERS FOR OBVIOUS REASONS THERE WAS NO ACCOUNT TAKEN OF THE MIDDAY MEALS THOSE FAMILIES THAT MEET AT NOON ARE VERY FEW INDEED THE COMMITTEE THINKS THAT IN THIS TENDENCY TO SEPARATION AT MEAL TIME IS A DANGER THAT PARENTS WOULD DO WELL TO APPRECIATE AT ITS FULL COST TO THE COMPLAINT THAT FATHERS AND MOTHERS ARE AWAY FROM THEIR HOMES A GREAT DEAL THE FOLLOWING COMPILATION OF REPLIES CONCERNING 217 FATHERS AND 348 MOTHERS LENDS LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT NO EVENINGS IN WEEK FATHERS OUT MOTHERS OUT BOTH OUT O  104 158 I69 I 124 II6 88 2 57 50 36 3   7 M ORE 25 24 12 TOTALS  3 7 348 305 SURELY THE FACT THAT ONLY 8 PER CENT OF THE MOTHERS AND IO PER CENT OF THE FATHERS ARE ABSENT FROM HOME MORE THAN TWO EVENINGS OR AFTERNOONS IN CASES OF MOTHERS A WEEK WHILE 40 PER CENT OF THE FATHERS AND 46 PER CENT OF THE MOTHERS ARE ABSENT BUT ONCE A WEEK AND 46 PER CENT OF THE FATHERS AND 43 PER CENT OF THE MOTHERS ARE NEVER AWAY OR SO SELDOM THAT IT IS USELESS TO COUNT THE OUTINGS NEED NOT CALL FOR DIATRIBE FROM EITHER PULPIT PLATFORM OR PRESS THE COMMITTEE GRANTS HOWEVER THAT THESE FEW ERRING PARENTS OUGHT TO BE SAVED THEMSELVES FIRST THEN PERHAPS THEY CAN EXPECT THEIR CHILDREN TO BE SERENE STUDENTS THE COMMITTEE IS SURPRISED TO FIND SUCH A SCATTERING OF 380 PUPILS AS THIS TABLE SHOWS 60OTHE CAUSES OF STUDENT DELINQUENCY EVENINGS THE PUPIL IS AT HOME PUPILS 0   14 I  15 2    25 3  45 4 56 5  79 6  55 7 91 TOTAL 380 EVIDENTLY THESE CHILDREN BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN GO HOME WHEN THERE IS NO PLACE EASIER TO REACH IT CAN BE SEEN THAT 46 PER CENT OF THEM CONFESS THAT THEY ARE OUT THE LARGER SHARE OF THE EVENINGS IN A WEEK ONLY 54 PER CENT THAT THEY HAVE THE STAYATHOME HABIT WHAT OTHER REASON FOR THE DELINQUENCY OF THE 14 WHO ARE NEVER AT HOME DURING THE EVENING OR OF THE 15 WHO VISIT THEIR PARENTS BUT ONCE A WEEK IS TO BE LOOKED FOR  AND WHAT CAN BE SAID OF THE DISCIPLINE OF THE PARENTS WHO PERMIT THIS KIND OF THING  THIS FELONY IS COMPOUNDED BY THE ENTERTAINMENT OF COMPANY WHO SWARM THE STUDENTS IN THEIR QUIET HOURS AGAIN THE TABLE TELLS THE TALE COMPANY NEVER ENTERTAINED IN 52 FAMILIES COMPANY ENTERTAINED ONCE A WEEK IN 152 FAMILIES COMPANY ENTERTAINED TWICE A WEEK IN 59 FAMILIES COMPANY ENTERTAINED THRICE A WEEK IN 39 FAMILIES COMPANY ENTERTAINED OFTENER IN  I9 FAMILIES TOTAL   321 FAMILIES HERE WE HAVE 50 PER CENT OF THE NUMBER ANSWERING WHO SEE COMPANY ONCE A WEEK REGULARLY IF NOT FORMALLY 20 PER CENT TWICE AND I2 PER CENT THREE TIMES IT IS HARD FOR A LIVELY YOUNG ANIMAL TO KICK AGAINST THE PRICKS AND GO AWAY BY HIMSELF TO DEVOUR GEOMETRY OR HISTORY WHILE JUST BEYOND HIS PADDOCK ARE ELYSIAN FIELDS OF SONG AND LAUGHTER THAT SO MANY STUDENTS HAVE QUIET ROOMS IN WHICH TO STUDY IS ANOTHER MATTER OF SURPRISE TO THE COMMITTEE THE MEMBERS OF WHICH REMEMBER THEIR OWN MEAGER ACCOMMODATIONS BUT MINNEAPOLIS PARENTS ARE VERY CAREFUL TO SAVE THEIR CHILDREN FROM STRUGGLES WHICH 6OITHE SCHOOL REVIEW THEY THEMSELVES WERE FORCED TO MAKE IN RESPONSE TO A QUERY AS TO WHETHER THEY HAVE A QUIET PLACE TO STUDY 369 OF 427 SAID YES AND IN REPLY TO THE QUESTION WHERE ARTFULLY PUT THE COMMITTEE THOUGHT TO CATCH THOSE WHO MIGHT MISCONCEIVE THE TRUE NATURE OF QUIETUDE OF 346 236 SAY THAT THEY HAVE THEIR OWN ROOMS IS IT NOT POSSIBLE TO LAY THE FLATTERY TO HEART THAT WE ARE TO HAVE STUDIOUS BOYS AND GIRLS MERELY BECAUSE WE HAVE GIVEN THEM STUDYROOMS IS THE CASE OF THE MOTHER WHO WONDERED WHY WHEN SHE WENT TO VISIT HER ATHLETIC SON IN HIS APARTMENTS SHE SO OFTEN FOUND HIM EITHER ASLEEP OR CONNING SOME MATTER EXTRANEOUS TO HIS LESSON SO RARE ANOTHER DIVISION OF ITS TASK HAS AFFORDED THE COMMITTEE A GLIMPSE OF THESE HOMES THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF READING THERE WAS NO SURPRISE AWAITING IT THERE FOR ITS MEMBERS HAVE NOT READ THE ADVERTISEMENTS OF A CERTAIN PHILADELPHIA PUBLISHING HOUSE WITHOUT KNOWING THAT THE HOMES OF AMERICA ARE BEING BURIED IN THE PRODUCT OF THAT HOUSE WHO CAN SEE THE BALES OF NEWSPAPERS SHIPPED INTO EVERY BLOCK IN THE CITY AND INTO EVERY HAMLET IN THE STATE AND EXPECT SIMPLE UNGUIDED YOUTH TO SIT PORING OVER BIOGRAPHY THE CLASSIC NOVELS OR EVEN THE BETTER CLASS OF PERIODICALS ALL PERIODICALS THE COMMITTEE RATHER ARBITRARILY IT IS TRUE DIVIDES INTO FOUR CLASSES FIRST THOSE FILLED WITH CHEAP STORIES SECOND THOSE DEVOTED CHIEFLY TO THE HOMEWOMENS JOURNALS YOUNG PEOPLES MAGAZINES AND A FEW ONLY A FEW RELIGIOUS PAPERS THIRD THOSE DEVOTED CHIEFLY TO REFORM THAT FEATURE SPECIAL INDUSTRIAL AND SOCIAL ACTIVITIES AND FOURTH THOSE THAT DISCUSS CURRENT HISTORY IN A MORE OR LESS CRITI CAL MANNER AND ENCOURAGE THE MORE SERIOUS FORMS OF FICTION AND EXPOSITION THE FOLLOWING TABLE IS INTERESTING IF NOT REASSURING FAMILIES WHO TAKE NO PERIODICALS  72 NUMBER OF CLASS I PERIODICALS TAKEN  9 NUMBER OF CLASS 2 PERIODICALS TAKEN 402 NUMBER OF CLASS 3 PERIODICALS TAKEN 94 NUMBER OF CLASS 4 PERIODICALS TAKEN  67 THIS IS TO SAY THAT 20 PER CENT OF THESE FAMILIES APPARENTLY FIND THE NEWSPAPER ALLSUFFICIENT FOR REGULAR MENTAL DIET OF THOSE WEEKLIES AND MONTHLIES THAT ARE SUBSCRIBED FOR II PER CENT ARE CHEAP STORY MAGAZINES A LIKE PERCENTAGE THE SOCALLED MUCK 602THE CAUSES OF STUDENT DELINQUENCY RAKERS 19 PER CENT THE HIGHERPRICED AND GENERALLY DEEPERTONED PERIODICALS WHILE 50 PER CENT ARE HOME JOURNALS FROM THIS TABU LATION THE COMMITTEE BELIEVES THAT IT MAY JUSTLY CONCLUDE THAT ALTHOUGH THESE FAMILIES WHO READ MAGAZINES DO NOT INCLINE TO THE WORST THEY ARE NOT DISPOSED TO FURNISH THEIR YOUNG PEOPLE WITH MUCH FOOD FOR THOUGHT BOOK READING IS OF COURSE STIMULATED BY THE SCHOOLESPECIALLY BY THE HIGH SCHOOL WHICH DEMANDS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF COLLATERAL READING OF EACH STUDENT IN EACH TERM IN THIS WAY EVEN DELINQUENTS IN ENGLISH GET SOMETHING OF PERMANENT WORTH IT IS SUFFICIENT TO TURN TO THE PUBLICLIBRARY RECORDS TO DISCOVER THE KIND OF BOOKS THAT MINNEAPOLIS IS READING THOSE RECORDS GIVE 70 PER CENT OF FICTION TO I PER CENT OF BIOGRAPHY AND THE LIBRARIANS TESTIFY THAT THE FICTION IS PRINCIPALLY THE LIGHTEST THAT THE BOARD ALLOWS ON THE SHELVES WE MAY HOWEVER INFORM OURSELVES AS TO THE AMOUNT READ BY DELINQUENT STUDENTS SINCE JUNE I9I1 FROM THIS TABLE NUMBER OF NUMBER OF STUDENTS BOOKS REPLYING N ONE 79 5 OR LESS  89 MORE THAN 5 AND LESS THAN O  75 M ORE THAN I  32 T OTAL   375 HENCE IT IS CLEAR THAT 20 PER CENT READ NO BOOKS OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL 50 PER CENT LESS THAN 5 20 PER CENT MORE THAN 5 BUT LESS THAN IO AND ONLY IO PER CENT MORE THAN IO IN GENERAL THESE BOOKS CORRE SPOND IN CHARACTER TO THE PUBLIC LIBRARIANS TESTIMONY BUT HERE AND THERE ARE NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS OF STUDENTS WHO HAVE FAILED IN THE ROUTINE SCHOOL WORK FOR THE SAKE OF PUTTING TIME ON NOVELS TO WHICH THE TEACHERS HAVE INTRODUCED THEM THE COMMITTEE FINDS THAT THE CUSTOM OF READING ALOUD BY ONE MEMBER OF THE FAMILY FATHER OR MOTHER OR OLDER CHILD TO THE GROUP NO LONGER HOLDS THE PLACE IT USED TO HOLD HASTILY EATEN MEALS FOLLOWED BY THE RUSH TO WORK OR SCHOOL OR THE HURRY TO DRESS FOR THE EVENINGS ENGAGEMENTS DO NOT PERMIT THE COMMUNAL STUDY OF A POEM OR DISCUSSION OF A SERMON OR FRIENDLY DISPUTE OVER POLITICS THAT WAS WONT TO MAKE THE FAMILY CIRCLE A LYCEUM OF PURPOSE AND FORCE 603THE SCHOOL REVIEW OF 377 FAMILIES ACCOUNTED FOR IN THIS INQUIRY ONLY I29 APPEAR TO HAVE THE CUSTOM OF READING ALOUD IN OTHER WORDS 60 PER CENT OF THESE CHILDREN KNOW NOTHING OF THE ADVANTAGE FOR THOUGHT TRAINING AND GENERAL INFORMATION THAT THIS CUSTOM GIVES THE READING HABIT IS GENERALLY AFFECTED BY EITHER OR BOTH OF THE DRINKING AND SMOKING HABITS PREVIOUS OBSERVATION HAD NOT LED THE COMMITTEE TO EXPECT TO FIND MUCH EVIDENCE OF A LIQUOR HABIT AMONG STUDENTS EVEN OF THE HIGH SCHOOL IT HAD BEEN CONFIDENT HOWEVER THAT AN EXTENSIVE USE OF TOBACCO WOULD BE REVEALED BY ITS INQUIRIES THIS HABIT MANY INVESTIGATORS HAVE PROVED BEYOND A DOUBT INJURIOUS TO STUDY OF THE 228 WHO ANSWERED THE QUES TION REGARDING THE USE OF LIQUOR ONLY 9 CONFESSED TO DRINKING REGULARLY OF 246 ONLY 48 TO SMOKING REGULARLY WHETHER THESE LAST FIGURES BE CORRECT OR NOT THE PERCENTAGE IS LARGE ENOUGH TO ENTER INTO ANY DISCUSSION AS TO THE CAUSES OF DELINQUENCY A THOROUGHGOING CAMPAIGN SHOULD BE WAGED TO PREVENT BOYS FROM USING TOBACCO IN ANY FORM FINALLY THE COMMITTEE HAS FELT THAT A LACK OF A HOME TASK SOMETHING FOR WHICH THE BOY OR GIRL SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE DURING A CERTAIN DEFINITE TIME OF EACH DAYIS A LARGE FACTOR IN THE PROBLEM OF HIS OR HER DELINQUENCYIN THE FAILURE OF THIS BOY OR GIRL TO UNDERTAKE HIS OR HER SCHOOL TASK AND CARRY IT THROUGH TO THE END WITH THIS IDEA FIRMLY IN MIND THE COMMITTEE ASKED BOTH WHETHER THERE WAS A TASK AND HOW LONG IT TOOK TO PERFORM IT THE ANSWERS ARE VERY INTERESTINGAND ONCE MORE VERY SURPRISING 225 SAY THAT THEY HAVE SUCH TASKS AND 92 THAT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO AT ALL BUT OF THOSE WHO WORK ABOUT THE HOUSE I54 ARE EMPLOYED BUT HALF AN HOUR EACH DAY AND ONLY 39 MORE THAN AN HOUR ONE BOY SAID THAT HE HAD TO FEED THE DOG EVERY DAY AND A GIRL ADMITTED THAT HER REGULAR JOB WAS TO PAY THE HIRED MAID ONCE A WEEK IT IS CLEAR THAT FOR THE OLD WOODPILE NO FITTING SUBSTITUTE HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE SURE THE MODERN HOUSE SEEMS TO BE THE ROBBER BUT ALTHOUGH IT HAS TAKEN AWAY THE CHANCE TO HEW WOOD AND DRAW WATER IT HAS PROVIDED A WARM LIGHT BASEMENT SUITABLE FOR A WORKSHOP IN WHICH THE SKILL LEARNED IN THE MANUALTRAINING SHOP CAN BE APPLIED TO THE REPAIR AND EVEN THE MANUFACTURE OF FURNITURE THE PRIDE OF ANY FAMILY TO EXHIBIT IN THIS DAY OF BUSINESS EFFICIENCY 604THE CAUSES OF STUDENT DELINQUENCY IT OFFERS TOO A FINE OPPORTUNITY TO THE COMMERCIALLY INCLINED STU DENT WHAT HOUSEHOLD WOULD NOT BE BETTER FOR A MORE CAREFUL ACCOUNTING OF ITS EXPENDITURES AND IN THIS TIME OF HUSTLE IT INVITES SOMEONE TO BE THE READER TO THE FAMILYSOMEONE WHO MAY AS WELL BE A SCHOOLBOY OR GIRL AS THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY WHAT IS NEEDED THE COMMITTEE THINKS IS NOT A RETURN TO THE IMPOSSIBLE CONDITIONS BUT AN ADJUSTMENT TO THOSE OF MODERN LIFE TO PUT ITS FINGER UPON THE CAUSE OF STUDENT DELINQUENCY THE COM MITTEE DOES NOT VENTURE IT FEELS THAT THE FICKLE BUSINESS WORLD WITH ITS EVERINCREASING DEMANDS IS THE PRIME FACTOR IN THE PRESENT UNREST OF MIND AND SPIRIT THAT THE HOME IS THE VICTIM OF THIS UNREST AND THAT HENCE IT DOES NOT FURNISH YOUTH DISCIPLINED FAITHFULLY AND CARE FULLY TO FOLLOW INSTRUCTION TO THE PLACE WHERE INITIATIVE TAKES UP THE BURDEN OF LIFE AND GUIDES LIFE NOT ONLY TO SUPPORT ITSELF WITH FOOD BUT TO SUSTAIN ITSELF WITH CULTURE WHICH OUR FATHERS WHO BROUGHT FORTH THIS NATION UNDERSTOOD SO WELL THIS SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY INSPIRED BY FAMILY UNION STRENGTHENED BY HABITS OF SELFDENIAL AND BY REFLECTION THAT COMETH NOT OF COMIC SUPPLE MENTS AND LIGHT READING AND FURTHER DEVELOPED BY THE PRACTICE OF CARRYING BURDENS DAY AFTER DAY THE COMMITTEE FEELS IS LACKING IN MANY MINNEAPOLIS HOMESA STATEMENT WHICH ITS INVESTIGATIONS IT BELIEVES ENTITLE IT TO MAKE III REPORT OF SUBCOMMITTEE ON AMUSEMENTS AND EMPLOYMENT D H HOLBROOK EAST HIGH SCHOOL MINNEAPOLIS YOUR COMMITTEE ON AMUSEMENTS AND EMPLOYMENT HAS CONFINED ITS INVESTIGATION TO A LIMITED FIELD AND PRESENTS STATISTICS SUGGESTING CONCLUSIONS ON THE FOLLOWING POINTS I AVERAGE FREQUENCY OF ATTENDANCE AT PLACES OF AMUSEMENT 2 EXTENT TO WHICH THIS MAY BE A CONTRIBUTING CAUSE OF DELINQUENCY 3 CHARACTER OF AMUSEMENTS 4 EXTENT TO WHICH OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT IS A CONTRIBUTING CAUSE IN ANSWER TO THE QUESTIONS HOW OFTEN DO YOU ATTEND THE MOVING PICTURE SHOW THE VAUDEVILLE THE REGULAR THEATER PARTIES VISIT 605THE SCHOOL REVIEW EVENINGS AND REMAIN WITH FRIENDS OVER NIGHT  THE FOLLOWING FIGURES WERE GATHERED TABLE I FREQUENCY OF ATTENDANCE FREQUENCY PSHWSE VAUDEVILLE PARTIES VISITING THEATER TOTAL TWICE A WEEK  44 8 3 2I 4 80 WEEKLY  62 69 27 30 33 22I BIWEEKLY  31 27 24 9 34 125 MONTHLY  75 87 II8 32 80 392 212 I9I I72 92 15I 8I8 IN ORDER TO SHOW THE AVERAGE FREQUENCY FOR THE ENTIRE 400 THE FIGURES SHOULD BE REDUCED TO A COMMON BASIS BY MULTIPLYING THE TWICE A WEEK TOTAL BY 8 THE WEEKLY BY 4 THE BIWEEKLY BY 2 AND ADDING THESE TO THE MONTHLY TOTAL IT WILL BE FOUND THAT A GRAND TOTAL OF 2166 OCCASIONS WERE DEVOTED TO IDLE AMUSEMENTS EACH MONTH BY THESE 400 DELINQUENTS AN AVERAGE OF OFTENER THAN ONCE A WEEK REALIZING THAT THIS AVERAGE WAS NOT EVENLY DISTRIBUTED THAT A LARGE NUMBER WERE DELINQUENT FROM OTHER CAUSES AND THEREFORE THAT SOME MUST BE ATTENDING OUTSIDE ATTRACTIONS WITH CONSIDERABLE REGULARITY THE COMMITTEE MADE A STUDY OF THE HABITS OF EACH OF THE 400 AND PREPARED THE FOLLOWING TABLE TABLE II HABITS OF EACH INDIVIDUAL APPARENTLY NOT AWAY FROM HOME AT ALL  36 33 PER CENT NOT OFTENER THAN ONCE A WEEK  03 25 NOT OFTENER THAN TWICE A WEEK  83 20 NOT OFTENER THAN THRICE A WEEK  49 I2 NOT OFTENER THAN FOUR TIMES A WEEK  22 6 NEARLY EVERY AFTERNOON OR EVENING  4 4 407 0OO IT WILL BE OBSERVED THAT THIS TABLE SUPPLEMENTS THE FINDINGS OF THE COMMITTEE ON HOME CONDITIONS AND THAT THE FOURTEEN WHO CON FESSED THAT THEY WERE NEVER AT HOME ARE ACCOUNTED FORTHIS WITH OUT COLLUSION BETWEEN THE COMMITTEES THE COMMITTEE SUBMITS THAT WHEN 42 PER CENT OF ALL DELINQUENTS 62 PER CENT OF THOSE GOING 6O6THE CAUSES OF STUDENT DELINQUENCY OUTSIDE THE HOME AT ALL FOR AMUSEMENT ARE AWAY FROM HOME AND SCHOOL AS OFTEN AS TWO AFTERNOONS OR EVENINGS A WEEK IN PURSUIT OF WHATEVER RECREATION THEIR WHIM OR POCKETBOOK MAY DICTATE CERTAINLY ONE OF THE CAUSES OF DELINQUENCY IS AN OVERINDULGENCE IN IDLE AMUSEMENT AS TO THE CHARACTER OF THESE AMUSEMENTS THE COMMITTEE HAS NO FACTS TO OFFER IT WAS FELT THAT THE WORK OF CENSORING PLACES OF AMUSEMENT AND ESTIMATING THEIR EDUCATIONAL VALUES IS A TASK BY ITSELF AND THAT THE FACTS ABOVE STATED WOULD BE MORE FORCEFUL IF THEY SUGGESTED TO THE COMMUNITY THE NEED OF FUTURE CAREFUL INVESTIGATION BY MORE EXPERT AND COMPETENT AUTHORITIES THAN IF THEY WERE OBSCURED BY SUCH INCOMPLETE DATA AS WE MIGHT PRESENT AT THIS TIME IT WILL BE NOTICED HOWEVER IN TABLE I THAT 44 IO PER CENT OF THE 400 SAY THEY ARE ACCUSTOMED TO SPEND TWO AFTERNOONS OR EVENINGS AT THE PICTURE SHOWS AND THAT OF THE 2I2 WHO GO THERE AT ANY TIME IO6 OR 50 PER CENT ATTEND AS OFTEN AS ONCE A WEEK YET THE PREFERENCES EXPRESSED IN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION WHICH DO YOU LIKE BEST SHOWS THAT ONLY 24 PREFER THE PICTURE SHOW 92 THE VAUDEVILLE AND I42 THE REGULAR THEATER WHILE I49 HAVE NO CHOICE IT WOULD SEEM TO YOUR COMMITTEE THAT THE REASON SO MANY ARE WASTING THEIR TIME IN THIS MANNER IS NOT THAT THEY LIKE IT BUT THAT THEY CAN AFFORD IT AND THAT THE NEED IS CERTAIN AND THE DEMAND GREAT FOR SOME SOCIAL MACHINERY TO PROVIDE THE MEANS FOR REALIZ ING THE IDEALS EXPRESSED IN THIS CHOICE OF AMUSEMENTS COMMON SENSE DOES NOT DICTATE NOR DO OVERCROWDED COURSES PERMIT NOR WOULD OVERWORKED TEACHERS WELCOME AN ADDITION OF THIS NATURE TO THE ROUTINE WORK OF THE SCHOOL BUT THE DARK VACANT SCHOOL BUILDINGS WITH THEIR MANY WELLEQUIPPED AUDITORIUMS AND GYMNASI UMS STAND AS A CONSTANT REPROACH TO OUR TARDINESS AS A COMMUNITY IN PROVIDING CHEAP WHOLESOME AMUSEMENT FOR ALL OUR BOYS AND GIRLS TOGETHER WITH THEIR FATHERS AND MOTHERS WHEN THE AUTHORITIES SHALL SEE THEIR WAY CLEAR TO ADOPT AN AGGRESSIVE POLICY IN LEADING THE PEOPLE TO USE THEIR SCHOOL BUILDINGS FOR EDUCATIONAL AND RECREATIONAL PURPOSES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT A LONG STEP WILL HAVE BEEN TAKEN TOWARD PROVIDING SUPERVISED AND WHOLESOME AMUSEMENT FOR NORMAL AS WELL AS DELINQUENT PUPILS IN THIS CONNECTION IT SHOULD BE STATED THAT AN INVESTIGATION 607THE SCHOOL REVIEW WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY SHOW THAT THE CONDITIONS TABULATED FOR THESE DELINQUENT PUPILS ARE NOT EXCEPTIONAL BUT ARE NORMAL FOR ALL PUPILS A COMPARISON OF OUR FIGURES WITH THOSE GATHERED LAST YEAR BY MRS PERRY STARKWEATHER ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER OF LABOR SHOWS THAT THE PERCENTAGE OF ALL CHILDREN ATTENDING PICTURE SHOWS IS ABOUT THE SAME AS THE ABOVE PERCENTAGE FOR DELINQUENTS IF TOO FREQUENT ATTENDANCE ON PICTURE SHOWS IS A CAUSE OF DELINQUENCY SURELY AN EQUALLY FREQUENT ATTENDANCE BY ALL PUPILS MUST BE A SERIOUS INTER FERENCE WITH THE BEST RESULTS IN THE MATTER OF EMPLOYMENT THE FOLLOWING FIGURES ARE SUGGESTIVE TABLE III EMPLOYED AT WORK OTHER THAN HOME TASKS AFTERNOONS  97 CARRYING PAPERS  44 EVENINGS   2 CLERKS   34 ALL NIGHT  I DELIVERY BOYS 24 SATURDAYS  2 TRADES 19 121 121 IT IS EVIDENT FROM THE FOREGOING THAT THE IOO OR 25 PER CENT OF THE 400 WHO WORK SEVERAL HOURS EVERY DAY POINT TO ANOTHER CAUSE OF FAILURE TO DO NORMAL SCHOOL WORK BUT THE COMMITTEE WAS IN DOUBT WHAT IMPORTANCE TO ATTACH TO THIS APPARENT CAUSE IN VIEW OF THE WELLKNOWN FACT THAT WE HAVE MANY BOYS WHO ARE EARNING THEIR ENTIRE EXPENSES AND DOING VERY CREDITABLE CLASS WORK WITH THIS IN MIND THE CASES WERE STUDIED TO SEE IF THIS WERE AS LARGE A FACTOR AS IT SEEMED IT WAS FOUND THAT 54 OF THE IOO WERE NUMBERED AMONG THOSE WHO ATTENDED AMUSEMENTS AS OFTEN AS ONCE A WEEK IT WOULD SEEM THEREFORE THAT THEIR OUTSIDE WORK WAS ONLY ONE FACTOR IN HALF THE CASES THE COMMITTEE WAS INTERESTED IN KNOWING THE AMBITIONS AND ASPIRATIONS THAT WERE IN THE MINDS OF THE 400 AND WERE SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT 38 WISHED TO BE BUSINESS MEN 48 TO WORK AT A TRADE AND O16 TO FOLLOW A PROFESSION 226 EXPRESSED NO CHOICE AN ENTIRELY LIKELY PERCENTAGE CONSIDERING THE AGES IT WAS NOT WITHOUT POINT TO DISCOVER THAT THE FAVORITE CHOICE OF THE IO6 FAILURES IN SCHOOL WHO THINK THEY ARE PREPARING FOR A PROFESSION IS TEACHING ONLY I5 TOOK AN ACTIVE INTEREST IN ATHLETICS IN ANSWER TO 608THE CAUSES OF STUDENT DELINQUENCY THE QUESTION WHAT PHYSICAL EXERCISE DOES HE HAVE I45 SAID THEY HAD SUFFICIENT 78 HAD SOME AND 83 NONE THE DATA ON THIS POINT WERE SO INDEFINITE HOWEVER THAT NO VERY SPECIFIC INFORMATION WAS SECURED IN CONCLUSION THE COMMITTEE FINDS THAT I THE DELINQUENT PUPILS ARE SPENDING MORE THAN ONE AFTERNOON OR EVENING AWAY FROM HOME IN UNSUPERVISED RECREATION 2 SIXTYTWO PER CENT OF THOSE SEEKING AMUSEMENT OUTSIDE THE HOME ARE GOING TWICE A WEEK OR OFTENER 3 A FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THE CHARACTER OF AMUSEMENT NOW AFFORDED SHOULD BE MADE THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE SCHOOL BUILDING AS A SOCIAL CENTER IS ADVISABLE IV CORRECTIVE AND PREVENTIVE AGENCIES W H SHEPHARD NORTH HIGH SCHOOL MINNEAPOLIS THIS SUBCOMMITTEE HAS HAD FOR ITS MORE IMMEDIATE FIELD SUCH AGENCIES AS THE JUVENILE COURT THE TRUANT OR UNGRADED SCHOOL THE BOYS DETENTION HOME VACATION SCHOOLS AND THE UNGRADED TEACHER IT MAY BE CAUSE FOR GRATULATION THAT THE RETURNS FROM THESE INQUIRIES WERE SO MEAGER IT HAS BEEN APPARENT IN MANY CASES WHERE REPLIES WERE MADE THAT THE RELATION OF CAUSE AND EFFECT COULD HARDLY BE DISCOVERED OR DEDUCED SINCE IT IS TRUE HOW EVER THAT SUCH INSTITUTIONS AS THE COURT THE UNGRADED SCHOOL AND THE BOYS DETENTION HOME ARE CONSTANTLY IN TOUCH WITH AND OF SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS IT MAY BE WISE TO REFER TO THEIR PAR TICULAR ACTIVITIES ALTOGETHER IN TEN CASES REPORTED TO USEIGHT GRADE PUPILS AND TWO HIGHSCHOOL STUDENTSHAS THE JUVENILE COURT BEEN DIRECTLY A FACTOR AND HELPFUL IN IMPROVING THE DEPORTMENT IF NOT THE SCHOLAR SHIP OF MOST OF THEM IN TWO CASES HOJNE CONDITIONS WERE UNMIS TAKABLY BAD THROUGH LACK OF MORAL RESTRAINT THREE OF THE BOYS HAVE BEEN UNDER EACH OF THE FOLLOWING AGENCIES JUVENILE COURT TRUANT

SCHOLARSHIP FROM MISS KATE FINKLES STUDY OF JUVENILE COURT CASES COVER ING A PERIOD OF TWO YEARS I908O0 A NUMBER OF CONCLUSIONS ARE HERE GIVEN REFLECTING UPON HOME CONDITIONS OF CONTRIBUTING CAUSES BEHIND OFFENSES THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IS DEFICIENCY IN THE HOME WHERE ALMOST WITHOUT EXCEPTION LIES THE FAULT THE WEAK HOMES THOSE THAT FAIL SUFFICIENTLY TO PROTECT THE CHILD ARE I ABNORMAL IN CONSTRUCTION OF FAMILY LIFE 2 ABNORMAL OR SUBNORMAL IN PARENTAL CONTROL MISS FINKLE FURTHER DIVIDES THE ABNORMAL HOME INTO THE FOLLOWING CLASSES A THE DEFICIENT HOME IN WHICH ONE OR BOTH PARENTS ARE DEAD INSANE OR DIVORCED B THE HALF HOME IN WHICH BOTH PARENTS WORK OR WHERE THE FATHER IS ABSENT FROM TOWN A LARGE PART OF THE TIME C THE HOME WHERE POVERTY CROWDS D THE VICIOUS HOME IN WHICH THERE IS DRINK IMMORALITY OR WHERE THE PARENTS HAVE SERVED OR ARE SERVING WORKHOUSE SENTENCES IN REFERENCE TO THE SECOND CLASS THE DIVISIONS ARE AS FOLLOWS A THE HOME WHERE PARENTAL CONTROL IS WEAK THROUGH LACK OF WILLPOWER B THE HOME WHERE PARENTS ARE TOO INDULGENT OUT OF THE I070 CASES 126 IN WHICH THE FAMILY CONSTRUCTION WAS PERFECT WERE DISMISSED AFTER TRIAL 416 OF THE FAMILIES OR 39 PER CENT OF THE TOTAL WERE NOT NORMALLY CONSTITUTED THAT IS EITHER THE FATHER OR MOTHER OR BOTH HAD DIED OR WERE INSANE OR THE PARENTS WERE DIVORCED OR SEPARATED IN 63 FAMILIES THERE WAS DRUNKENNESS TO EXCESS ON PART OF EITHER OR BOTH PARENTS IN 3I FAMILIES THE PARENTS WERE EITHER MENTALLY OR PHYSICALLY DISABLED THRIFTLESSNESS AND IMMORALITY SHOW IN MANY OF THESE CASES THE TOTAL OF THE FOREGOING FAMILIES ABNORMAL IN CONSTRUCTION GIVES 51 PER CENT 1SPECIAL PROBATION OFFICER HENNEPIN COUNTY JUVENILE COURT 6IOTHE CAUSES OF STUDENT DELINQUENCY IN THE REMAINING 49 PER CENT OF THE I070 FAMILIES INITIAL DELIN QUENCY IS ATTRIBUTED TO  LACK OF PROPER CONTROL OR TOO GREAT INDUL GENCE ON THE PART OF THE PARENTS IN 24 PER CENT OF THE FAMILIES SO CONSIDERED ONE OR BOTH OF THE PARENTS FRANKLY ADMIT THAT THEIR CHILD IS BEYOND HOME CONTROL AN ADMISSION MADE NOT ONLY BY DWELLERS ON THE FLATS BUT BY THOSE LIVING ON THE PARKWAYS AND BOULEVARDS THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE SPECIAL OFFICER AS TO INADE QUATE PLAYGROUNDS AND LACK OF SMALL PARKS WHERE MOST NEEDED THE NEED OF A SCHOOL OF TRAINING FOR PARENTS THE LACK OF ENFORCE MENT OF ANTICIGARETTE LAWS AND CURFEW ORDINANCES ARE PERTINENT TO THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF PROPER CONTROL THIS SURVEY DEMONSTRATES AT LEAST ONE THING AS INDICATED ELSEWHERE THAT IN THE HOME ARE THE CHIEF ISSUES AND THE GREATEST BURDEN OF THE PROBLEMS SOLUTION AND YET THE STATEMENT IN A RECENT BULLETIN OF MUNICIPAL STATISTICS ISSUED BY THE MINNEAPOLIS CITY CONTROLLER TO THE EFFECT THAT 70 PER CENT OF THE TOTAL POPULATION OF 3O0000 ARE LIVING IN HOMES RATHER THAN IN HOTELS AND APARTMENT BUILDINGS INDICATES RATHER AN EXCEPTIONAL AND FAVORABLE CONDITION AS CITIES GO FOR NORMAL FAMILY LIFE THE DETENTION HOME IS LOCATED 14 MILES FROM THE CITY ON 92 ACRES OF LAND AN EXCELLENT FARM HOME CAREFULLY AND ABLY SUPERVISED TO IT DELINQUENT AND DEPENDENT BOYS ARE REGULARLY COMMITTED BY THE JUVENILE COURT IT IS ORGANIZED ON THE FAMILY PLAN WITH INSTRUCTION IN THE THIRD FIFTH AND SEVENTH GRADES SIX MONTHS IS THE MAXIMUM TERM IN I9II 85 BOYS WERE COMMITTED JANUARY I 1912 2I BOYS WERE ON HAND IT IS SIGNIFICANT THAT IN 41 OF THE ABOVE CASES THE PARENTS WERE SEPARATED OR ONE OR BOTH DEAD 52 OF THESE BOYS WERE 14 AND BELOW IN AGE BUT 3 CASES ON OUR INQUIRY APPEAR ON ITS ROLLS ONE A TRUANT IN THE UNGRADED SCHOOL TWO OF THE DELINQUENTS IN THIS INQUIRY HAD BEEN ENROLLED IN EACH CASE THE HOME CONDITIONS WERE DEPLOR ABLE THIS SCHOOL TRIES TO MAKE A SPECIAL STUDY OF EACH OF ITS PUPILS GENERALLY WITHOUT LAYING HANDS ON MOST OF THE PUPILS ARE ABOVE THE AVERAGE IN INTELLIGENCE MANY OF THEM BEING VICTIMS OF ENVIRONMENT IE THE CONDITIONS IN THE GRADES WHERE A TIRED UNDER JOINT DIRECTION OF JUDGES OF DISTRICT COURT AND BOARD OF COUNTY COM MISSIONERSTHE SCHOOL REVIEW TEACHER WITH NERVES HAS TOO MANY PUPILS THIS SCHOOL HAS MORE TO DO WITH VERY ACTIVE BOYS WHO EASILY DO THEIR WORK THAN WITH THOSE TO WHOM WE REFER AS  DELINQUENTS ALL TOLD THERE WERE 176 ENROLLED IN 19II12 AND THE NUMBER IN ATTENDANCE AT ONE TIME RANGED FROM 12 TO 20 THERE FOR A PERIOD OF ONE MONTH THE UNGRADED TEACHER AS SHE IS CALLED IS ESPECIALLY APPOINTED TO EACH BUILDING TO HELP BACKWARD PUPILS OF ANY GRADE THE RETURNS SHOW THAT 22 PUPILS HAVE BEEN UNDER SUCH SUPERVISION ONCE EACH ONE TWICE ONE THREE TIMES AND ONE FOUR TIMES IN HALF A DOZEN CASES SICKNESS APPARENTLY WAS THE PREDISPOSING CAUSE IN TWO CASES OF HIGHSCHOOL STUDENTS THE REASON ASSIGNED WAS THAT THEIR PEOPLE HAD MOVED A GREAT DEAL EIGHT HIGHSCHOOL STUDENTS TESTIFY TO THE NECESSITY OF ATTENDANCE IN THE VACATION SCHOOLS GIVING AS THE REASONS TOO RAPID GROWTH TOO LITTLE STUDY TOO MUCH OUTSIDE WORK AND TROUBLE WITH MATHE MATICS EIGHTEEN GRADE PUPILS REPORT HAVING ATTENDED SUCH SCHOOLS OF THESE THREE HAVE ALSO HAD THE ASSISTANCE OF THE UNGRADED TEACHER SEVERAL TIMES VERY FEW OF THESE APPEAR ABNORMAL IN TYPE THE MAIN CONCLUSION OF THIS COMMITTEE IS THAT WHILE FEW OF THE FAILING STUDENTS APPEAR TO HAVE COME UNDER THE SUPERVISION OR RESTRAINT OF THESE CORRECTIVE AND PREVENTIVE AGENCIES THE DATA GATHERED REINFORCE THE CONTENTION THAT OUR AMERICAN HOMES TOO EASILY GIVE OVER THE TASK OF TEACHING AND DISCIPLINE TO THE SCHOOL AND TO THE PUPIL

J100587,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 16831775,103820,AN ACCOUNT OF SOME MAGNETICAL OBSERVATIONS MADE IN THE MONTHS OF MAY JUNE AND JULY 1732 IN THE ATLANTICK OR WESTERN OCEAN AS ALSO THE DESCRIPTION OF A WATERSPOUT BY MR JOSEPH HARRIS COMMUNICATED BY MR GEORGE GRAHAM F R S,I206903,S FIG 1 R O Q P Q M I K G H A B E E FIG 2 F75 IV AN ACCOUNT OF SOME MAGNETICAL OBSER VATIONS MADE IN THE MONTHS OF MAY JUNE AND JULY 1732 IN THE ATLANTICK OR WESTERN OCEAN AS ALSO THE DESCRIPTION OF A WATERSPOUT BY MR JOSEPH HARRIS COMMUNICATED BY MR GEORGE GRAHAM F R S T H E KNOWLEDGE OF THE MAGNETICAL VARIATION IS OF SUCH CONSEQUENCE TO THE MARINER THAT WITHOUT IT HE CANNOT KNOW HIS COURSE AND WERE THE THEORY THEREOF ONCE ESTABLISHED IT MIGHT BE OF GREAT USE FOR ESTIMATING THE LONGITUDE IN SEVERAL PARTS OF THE WORLD AS HAS BEEN OFTEN AND VERY JUSTLY OBSERV ED BY OTHERS BUT TILL THIS BE DETERMIND WE MUST RELY UPON OBSERVATIONS I SOMETIME SINCE TOOK NOTICE OF THE IMPERFECTIONS OF THE COMMON AZIMUTH COMPASS AND HOW ILL ADAPTED THAT INSTRUMENT IS FOR THE PURPOSE INTENDED I ALSO GAVE THE DESCRIPTION OF A NEW INSTRUMENT WHEREBY I PROPOSED TO REMEDY THE PRINCIPAL OBJECTI ONS TO THE FORMER AND FARTHER EXPERIENCE HAS SUFFICI ENTLY CONFIRMED ME IN WHAT I HAVE SAID BUT I SHOULD BE GLAD TO HAVE IT DETERMINED BY THOSE WHO HAVE CON VENIENT OPPORTUNITIES OF MAKING EXPERIMENTS OF THIS KIND WHAT WOULD BE THE PROPEREST DIAMETER AND WEIGHT FOR A NEEDLE AND CARD AND WHAT OUGHT TO BE THEIR PROPORTIONAL WEIGHTS TO EACH OTHER WHEN TAKEN SEPARATELY REGARD BEING HAD THAT THE FRICTION BE76 BE NO MORE THAN WHAT IS NECESSARY TO PREVENT THE CARD FROM BEING TOO MUCH AFFECTED BY THE MOTION OF THE SHIP SOME OBSERVATIONS INCLINE ME TO THINK THAT A SEACARD SHOULD NOT EXCEED SIX INCHES DIAME TER AND THAT MOST OF THOSE GENERALLY USED ARE TOO HEAVY FOR NICE EXPERIMENTS THO THEY MAY BE WELL ENOUGH ADAPTED FOR COMMON PURPOSES IN THE MONTHS OF MARCH AND APRIL 1732 THE VARIATION AT BLACKRIVER IN JAMAICA WAS VERY AC CURATELY OBSERVED TO BE FROM 6 TO 6 05 EASTERLY OFF THE HAVANNA ABOUT 4 12 DEG EASTERLY THE REST OF THE OBSERVATIONS I MADE ARE EXPRESSED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE LONGIT LONGIT LATITUDE FROM LON VARIAT

THE SEA WAS PRETTY ROUGH AN OBSERVATION MIGHT BE DEPENDED UPON TO ABOUT A QUARTER OF A DEGREE HAD THE CARD PERFORMED TO THE SAME EXACTNESS BUT BY COMPARING SEVERAL OBSERVATIONS MADE UNDER THE LIKE77 LIKE CIRCUMSTANCES AS TO THE WEATHER IT SEEMS TO ME AS IF THE VIRTUE OF THE NEEDLE WAS NOT ALWAYS OF EQUAL STRENGTH SOMETIMES SEVERAL OBSERVATIONS WOULD AGREE EXCEEDINGLY WELL AT OTHER TIMES THE CARD WOULD STAND INDIFFERENTLY ANY WHERE WITHIN A DEGREE OR MORE OF ITS MERIDIAN AND THIS I OBSERVD IN SEVERAL CARDS I FOUND ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH SURPRIZED ME MUCH THE CARD WOULD SOME TIMES DIFFER ABOUT TWO DEGREES FROM IT SELF BETWIXT THE MORNING AND EVENING OF THE SAME DAY AND THIS DIFFERENCE WOULD CONTINUE AS IT WERE REGULARLY FOR SEVERAL DAYS THEN VANISH FOR A WEEK OR MORE AND AFTERWARDS WOULD RETURN AND CONTINUE AS BEFORE THE GREATNESS OF THIS DIFFERENCE AND THE NEAR AGREE MENT BETWIXT THE OBSERVATIONS MADE IN THE SAMEFORE NOON OR AFTERNOON AMONGST THEMSELVES WILL NOT GIVE ME ROOM TO SUSPECT THAT IT PROCEEDED ALTOGETHER FROM AN ERROR IN OBSERVING I OWN I CANNOT ACCOUNT FOR IT BUT WHATEVER BE THE CAUSE THEREOF THE ERROR WAS ALWAYS THE SAME WAY THAT IS THE WESTERLY VARIATI ON IN THE MORNING WOULD BE LESS THAN IN THE AFTER NOON I CAREFULLY EXAMINED IF THIS COULD BE ANY WAYS OWING TO THE INSTRUMENT OR TO ANY IRON NEAR THE PLACE WHERE IT WAS USUALLY SET FOR OBSERVATION BUT I WAS FULLY CONVINCED IT COULD PROCEED FROM NEI THER I KNOW NOT WHETHER ANY SUCH OBSERVATIONS AS THESE HAVE BEEN MADE BEFORE BUT I THINK IT WOULD NOT BE UNUSEFUL IF THOSE WHO HAVE PROPER INSTRU MENTS AND ARE SUFFICIENTLY SKILLED WOULD COMMUNI CATE ANY THING OF THIS KIND THAT MAY OCCUR IT NOW APPEARS THAT THE NUMBERS IN THE FOREGOING TABLE CANNOT BE STRICTLY ACCURATE BUT I THINK THE ERROR CAN SCARCE ANY WHERE EXCEED HALF A DEGREE FOR IN78 IN MOST CASES SEVERAL OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE PRETTY NEAR TOGETHER OF WHICH I TOOK A MEDIUM MAKING ALLOWANCES ACCORDING TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING EACH AND PERHAPS THEY ARE AS EXACT AS CAN BE WELL EXPECTED FROM SEAJOURNALS AND THERE CAN BE NO SENSIBLE ERROR AS TO LONGITUDES OUR RECKONING WHEN WE MADE THE LAND HAPPENING TO FALL OUT TO A MORE THAN USUAL EXACTNESS I SHALL TAKE ANOTHER OPPORTU NITY TO COMMUNICATE SOME MAGNETICAL OBSERVATIONS MADE WITH GREAT CARE AT JAMAICA TO THIS I SHALL ADD THE DESCRIPTION OF A WATER SPOUT WHICH WE SAW ABOUT SUNSET MAY 21ST 1732 IN THE LATITUDE 32 30 N AND LONGITUDE 9 EASTERLY FROM THE MERIDIAN OF CAPE FLORIDA VIDE T A B FIG 2 WHEN FIRST WE SAW THE SPOUT IT WAS WHOLE AND ENTIRE AND MUCH OF THE SHAPE AND PROPORTION OF A SPEAKINGTRUMPET AS EXPRESSED BY THE FIGURE AN NEXED THE SMALL END BEING DOWNWARDS AND REACH ING TO THE SEA AND THE BIG END TERMINATED IN A BLACK THICK CLOUD THE SPOUT ITSELF WAS ALSO VERY BLACK AND THE MORE SO THE HIGHER UP IT SEEMED TO BE EXACTLY PERPENDICULAR TO THE HORIZON AND ITS SIDES PERFECTLY SMOOTH WITHOUT THE LEAST RUGGEDNESS WHERE IT FELL THE SPRAY OF THE SEA ROSE TO A CONSIDERABLE HEIGHT WHICH MADE SOMEWHAT OF THE APPEARANCE OF A GREAT SMOAK FROM THE FIRST TIME WE SAW IT IT CONTINUED WHOLE ABOUT A MINUTE AND TILL IT WAS QUITE DISSIPATED ABOUT THREE MINUTES IT BEGAN TO WASTE FROM BELOW AND SO GRADUALLY UP WHILST THE UPPER PART REMAINED EN TIRE WITHOUT ANY VISIBLE ALTERATION TILL AT LAST IT ENDED IN THE BLACK CLOUD ABOVE UPON WHICH THERE SEEMED79 SEEMED TO FALL A VERY HEAVY RAIN IN THAT NEIGHBOUR HOOD AS IT WASTED THE BOTTOM OF THE REMAINING PART WAS IRREGULAR SOMEWHAT LIKE THE TRUNK OF A TREE BROKE ASUNDER THERE WAS BUT LITTLE WIND AND THE SKY ELSEWHERE WAS PRETTY SERENE WE JUDGED THE SPOUT TO BE ABOVE TWO LEAGUES OFF AND I THINK THE ANGLE UNDER WHICH THE SMALL END APPEARED MUST BE AT LEAST 20 MIN ACCORDING TO WHICH ESTIMATION THE THICKNESS OF IT MUST BE UPWARDS OF 60 YARDS AND ITS HEIGHT OR LENGTH ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF A MILE

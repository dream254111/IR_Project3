these differences rather than the difference in quantity alone that have a deter minative influence in sex determination An examination of almost 10000 male and female eggs of P carycxcaulis shows that the male eggs occur about five times as often as the female eggs A study of the output of each stemmother shows that in some cases all of her progeny are males in other cases all females and in most cases both males and females with a preponderance of males The results are obviously not connected with chance combinations of chromosomes but definite  tendencies  exist in certain individuals that follow one or the other alternative These tendencies might seem to be the result of external factors but nothing was discovered in the history of the individuals that favors such an interpretation although the possi bility of such an effect must be granted The authors general conclusion is summed up in the statement that the quantitative interpreta tion of sexdetermination is only the first rude approximation to a solution The facts sug gest that the visible quantitative differences are associated with more profound changes and the facts described for the phylloxeran egg give some indication of the nature of those changes for the sex chromosomes seem rather to follow sex than to be its sole cause Factors of Form Regulation in Harenactis attenuata III Regulation in Rings by C M Child Under certain conditions short cylindrical pieces from the body of the ac tinian Harenactis attenuata form rings by the union of oral and aboral ends Such rings may give rise to one or several more or less radially symmetrical groups of tentacles in the region of union THE FIRST CRUISE OF THE  CARNEGIE AND HER EQUIPMENT1 THE Carnegie engaged in a magnetic sur vey of the oceans under the direction of the 1Abstract of paper presented before the Philo sophical Society of Washington November 20 1909 by Dr L A Bauer of the Carnegie Institu tion of Washington department of terrestrial magnetism of the Carnegie Institution of Washington entered on her first cruise August 21 last As may be recalled this is the first vessel in which the attempt has been made to exclude practically all materials affecting the compass needle Hence the magnetic data secured on her can be made immediately available it being now unnecessary to await the determination of troublesome and more or less uncertain devia tion corrections The tests made at Gardiners Bay Long Is land August 21 to September 2 and at Fal mouth England have demonstrated conclu sively that no correction of whatever kind need be applied to the Carnegie results The fol lowing table will show the close agreement in the values of the three magnetic elements ob tained on the various headings during the

the instruments are mounted The observations made on the trip from New London Conn to St Johns Newfound land and from there to Falmouth England during the severe October gales afforded ample opportunity for trying out the observational appliances and these stood the tests put upon them during the exceptionally adverse condi tions even beyond expectations A large part of the instrumental equipment was especially designed and constructed in the workshop of the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism In brief it may be confidently asserted that SCIENCE 73N S VOL XXXI No 785 ocean magnetic work is now on a stage of perfection not hitherto reached permitting obtaining useful data not only expeditiously but also with all necessary accuracy both as regards practical and scientific demands The introduction of circular observatories in which the magnetic instruments are mounted has proved of great advantage The domes being revolvable it is possible to direct an open panel to any part of the skies thus permitting astronomical and magnetic obser vations being made with full protection to the observer and the instrument from wind and weather Hitherto all such observations have had to be made on an open bridge Another important feature of the research work on this unique vessel is the developing and perfecting of a producer gas engine for auxiliary marine propulsion The Carnegie has a nonmagnetic plant of this kind of 150 horse power sufficient to drive her at six knots in calm weather or at about 144 knots per day at a total cost for coal consumed dur ing the day of but seven dollars Such diffi culties as have been encountered thus far are mainly due to the nonmagnetic metals which have had to be so largely employed How ever these difficulties are being successfully solved one by one As a matter of fact the Carnegie has entered and left every port thus far under bare poles with the aid of her auxiliary power and so likewise the vessel was swung during the trial tests at Gardiners Bay and Falmouth using only the auxiliary power This vessel is the first seagoing one having such a plant The next table gives the results of the mag netic observations up to Falmouth The last three columns show the average errors of the best magnetic charts at present available Glancing over them the following conclusions may be drawn 1 From Long Island to some point off New foundland the charts used by mariners show too small westerly magnetic declinations va riations of the compass by about one degree in the maximum thereafter and continuing to England the error changes sign indicating that the charts give too large west magnetic declination the maximum error being nearly one degree Were there not such a syste matic run in the errors they would not be of great importance to navigation but as the sign is the same for great distances the gen eral effect would be in the present instance Magnetic Results obtained on the  Carnegie SeptemberOctober 18 1909 in the Atlantic

DONBRIDGE EXPLAINING THE DRAUGHT OF T A B I BY H BEIGHTON F R S T H E WHEELS ARE PLACED UNDER THE ARCHES OF LONDONBRIDGE AND MOVED BY THE COMMON STREAM OF THE TIDEWATER OF THE RIVER THAMES A B THE AXELTREE OF THE WATERWHEEL 19 FEET LONG 3 FEET DIAMETER IN WHICH C D E F ARE FOUR SETS OF ARMS EIGHT IN EACH PLACE ON WHICH ARE FIXED G G G G FOUR RINGS OR SETS OF FELLOES IN DIAMETER 20 FEET AND THE FLOATS H H H 14 FEET LONG AND 18 INCHES DEEP BEING ABOUT 26 IN NUMBER THE WHEEL LIES WITH ITS TWO GUDGEONS OR CENTERS A B UPON TWO BRASSES IN THE PIECES M N WHICH ARE TWO GREAT LEVERS WHOSE FULCRUM OR PROP IS AN ARCHED PIECE OF TIMBER L THE LEVERS BEING MADE CIRCULAR ON THEIR LOWER SIDES TO AN ARCH OF THE RADIUS M O AND KEPT IN THEIR PLACES BY TWO ARCHING STUDS FIXED IN THE STOCK L THROUGH TWO MORTISES IN THE LE VER M N THE WHEEL IS BY THESE LEVERS MADE TO RISE AND FALL WITH THE TIDE WHICH IS PERFORMED IN THIS MANNER THE LEVERS M N ARE 16 FEET LONG FROM M THE FUL CRUM OF THE LEVER TO O THE GUDGEON OF THE WATER WHEEL 6 FEET AND FROM O TO THE ARCH AT N 10 FEET TO THE BOTTOM OF THE ARCH N IS FIXED A STRONG TRIPLE CHAIN P MADE AFTER THE FASHION OF A WATCH CHAIN BUT THE LINKS ARCHED TO A CIRCLE OF ONE FOOT DIAMETER6 DIAMETER HAVING NOTCHES OR TEETH TO TAKE HOLD OF THE LEAVES OF A PINION OF CAST IRON Q 10 INCHES DI AMETER WITH EIGHT TEETH IN IT MOVING ON AN AXIS THE OTHER LOOSE END OF THIS CHAIN HAS A LARGE WEIGHT HANG ING AT IT TO HELP TO COUNTERPOISE THE WHEEL AND PRESERVE THE CHAIN FROM SLIDING ON THE PINION ON THE SAME AXIS IS FIXED A COGWHEEL R 6 FEET DIAMETER WITH 48 COGS TO THIS IS APPLIED A TRUNDLE OR PINION S OF SIX ROUNDS OR TEETH AND UPON THE SAME AXIS IS FIXED T A COGWHEEL OF 51 COGS INTO WHICH THE TRUNDLE V OF SIX ROUNDS WORKS ON WHOSE AXIS IS A WINCH OR WINDLASS W BY WHICH ONE MAN WITH THE TWO WINDLASSES RAISES OR LETS DOWN THE WHEEL AS THERE IS OCCASION AND BECAUSE THE FULCRA OF THESE LEVERS M N ARE IN THE AXIS OF THE TRUNDLE K VIZ AT M OR X IN WHAT SITUATION SOEVER THE WHEEL IS RAISED OR LET DOWN THE COGWHEEL II IS ALWAYS EQUIDISTANT FROM M AND WORKS OR GEERS TRULY BY MEANS OF THIS MACHINE THE STRENGTH OF AN ORDI NARY MAN WILL RAISE ABOUT FIFTY TON WEIGHT I I IS A COGWHEEL FIXED NEAR THE END OF THE GREAT AXIS 8 FEET DIAMETER AND 44 COGS WORKING INTO A TRUNDLE K OF 412 FOOT DIAMETER AND 20 ROUNDS WHOSE AXIS OR SPINDLE IS OF CAST IRON 4 INCHES IN DIAMETER LYING IN BRASSES AT EACH END AS AT X Z Z IS A QUADRUPLE CRANK OF CAST IRON THE METAL BE ING 6 INCHES SQUARE EACH OF THE NECKS BEING TURNED ONE FOOT FROM THE CENTER WHICH IS FIXED IN BRASSES AT EACH END IN TWO HEADSTOCKS FASTNED DOWN BY CAPS ONE END OF THIS CRANK AT Y IS PLACED CLOSE ABUTTING TO THE END OF THE AXELTREE X WHERE THEY ARE AT THOSE ENDS SIX7 SIX INCHES DIAMETER EACH HAVING A SLIT IN THE ENDS WHERE AN IRON WEDGE IS PUT ONE HALF INTO THE END X THE OTHER HALF INTO Y BY MEANS OF WHICH THE AXIS X TURNS ABOUT THE CRANK Z Z THE FOUR NECKS OF THE CRANK HAVE EACH AN IRON SPEAR OR ROD FIXED AT THEIR UPPER ENDS TO THE RE SPECTIVE LIBRA OR LEVER A 1 2 3 4 WITHIN THREE FOOT OF THE END THESE LEVERS ARE 24 FEET LONG MO VING ON CENTERS IN THE FRAME B B B B AT THE END OF WHICH AT C 1

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

2 FORCING PIPES AS I SO THAT ONE SINGLE WHEEL WORKS 16 PUMPS ALL WHICH WORK COULD NOT BE DRAWN IN ONE PER SPECTIVE VIEW WITHOUT MAKING IT VERY MUCH CON FUSED A CALCULATION OF THE QUANTITY OF WATER RAISED BY THE ENGINES AT LONDONBRIDGE IN THE 1ST ARCH NEXT THE CITY IS ONE WHEEL  16 FORCERS WITH DOUBLE WORK OF  IN THE 3D  1ST WHEEL DOUBLE WORK AT ONE 12 END AND SINGLE AT THE OTHER ARCH 2D WHEEL IN THE MIDDLE  8 3D WHEEL  16 IN ALL 52 FORCERS ONE9 ONE REVOLUTION OF A WHEEL MAKES IN  215 STROKES EVERY FORCER  SO THAT ONE TURN OF THE 4 WHEELS MAKES 114 STROKES WHEN THE RIVER IS AT BEST THE WHEELS GO  SIX TIMES ROUND IN A MINUTE AND BUT 412 6 AT MIDDLE WATER  THE NUMBER OF STROKES IN A MINUTE 684 THE STROKE IS 212 FEETIN A 7 INCH BORERAISES 3 ALE THEY RAISE PER MINUTE 2052 GALL THAT IS 123120 GALLONS  1954 HOGSHEADS PER HOUR AND AT THE RATE OF 46896 HOGSHEADS IN A DAY TO THE HEIGHT OF 120 FEET THIS IS THE UTMOST QUANTITY THEY CAN RAISE SUP POSING THERE WERE NO IMPERFECTIONS OR LOSS AT ALL BUT IT IS CERTAIN FROM THE CONSIDERATIONS FOLLOW ING THAT NO ENGINE CAN RAISE SO MUCH AS WILL ANSWER THE QUANTITY OF WATER THE CYLINDER CONTAINS IN THE LENGTH OF THE FORCER OR PISTONS MOTION FOR FIRST THE OPENING AND SHUTTING OF THE VALVES LOSE NEARLY SO MUCH OF THAT COLUMN AS THE HEIGHT THEY RISE AND FALL SECONDLY NO LEATHER IS STRONG ENOUGH FOR THE PI STON BUT THERE MUST CONTINUALLY SLIP OR SQUEEZE BY SOME WATER WHEN IT IS RAISED TO A GREAT HEIGHT AND WHEN THE COLUMN IS SHORT IT WILL NOT PRESS THE LEATHER ENOUGH TO THE CYLINDER OR BARREL BUT ESPECIALLY AT THE BEGINNING OR FIRST MOVING OF THE PISTON THERE IS SO LITTLE WEIGHT ON IT THAT BEFORE THE LEATHER CAN EX PAND THERE IS SOME LOSS THIRDLY AND THIS LOSS IS MORE OR LESS AS THE PI STONS ARE LOOSER OR STRAIGHTER LEATHERED FOURTHLY WHEN THE LEATHERS GROW TOO SOFT THEY ARE NOT CAPABLE OF SUSTAINING THE PILLAR TO BE RAISED B FIFTHLY10 FIFTHLY IF THEY ARE LEATHERED VERY TIGHT AS TO LOSE NO WATER THEN A GREAT PART OF THE ENGINES FORCE IS DESTROYED BY THE FRICTION BY SOME EXPERIMENTS I HAVE ACCURATELY MADE  ON ENGINES WHOSE PARTS ARE LARGE AND EXCELLENTLY PER FORMED THEY WILL LOSE  AND SOMETIMES 14 OF THE CALCU LATED QUANTITY HOWEVER THE PERFECTIONS OR ERRORS OF ENGINES ARE TO BE COMPARED TOGETHER BY THE CALCULATED QUANTITIES OR FORCES FOR AS THEY DIFFER IN THOSE THEY WILL PROPOR TIONABLY DIFFER IN THEIR ACTUAL

ALTHOUGH THEY MAY JUSTLY BE ESTEEMED AS GOOD AS ANY IN EUROPE YET ARE THERE AS I CONCEIVE SOME THINGS WHICH MIGHT BE ALTERED VERY MUCH FOR THE BETTER FIRST IF INSTEAD OF SIXTEEN FORCERS THEY WORKED ONLY EIGHT THE STROKE MIGHT BE FIVE FEET IN EACH FOR CER WHICH WOULD DRAW A GREAT DEAL MORE WATER WITH THE SAME POWER ON THE WHEEL FOR THEN THERE WOULD BE BUT HALF THE OPENING AND SHUTTING OF VALVES CONSE QUENTLY BUT HALF THAT LOSS AND A FIVE FOOT STROKE DRAWS ABOVE DOUBLE THE QUANTITY OF TWO STROKES OF 2 12 EACH BY NEAR  IN REGARD THE VELOCITY IS B 2 DOUBLE12 DOUBLE WHICH IS THE MOST VALUABLE CONSIDERATION IN AN ENGINE WHERE THE PIPES WILL SUSTAIN SUCH FORCE SECONDLY THE BORES THAT CARRY OFF THE WATER FROM THE FORCERS ARE TOO SMALL THERE BEING NEARLY ALWAYS TWO PILLARS OF 7 INCHES DIAMETER FORCING INTO ONE PIPE OF THE SAME DIAMETER AND 7 X 7  49  49  98 THEREFORE THOSE PIPES OF CONVEYANCE SHOULD BE NEAR NINE INCHES DIAMETER THE PERFECTIONS OF THE MACHINE THE TIMBERWORK IS ALL ADMIRABLY WELL PERFORMED AND THE COMPOSITION AND CONTRIVANCE FOR STRENGTH AND USEFULNESS NOT EXCEEDED BY ANY I HAVE SEEN THE CAST IRON CRANKS ARE BETTER THAN WROUGHT ONES BY REASON THEY ARE VERY STIFF AND WILL NOT BE STRAINED BUT SOONER BREAK BUT THEN THEY ARE CHEAP AND NEW ONES EASILY PUT IN THE WEDGE FOR PUTTING ON OR RELEASING THE CRANK AND FORCERS IS BETTER THAN THE SLIDING SOCKETS COMMON LY USED THE FORCING BARRELS TRUNKS AND ALL THEIR APPARATUS ARE VERY CURIOUSLY CONTRIVED FOR PUTTING TOGETHER MEND ING ALTERING OR CLEANSING AND SUBJECT TO AS LITTLE FRICTION AS POSSIBLE IN THAT PART THE MACHINE FOR RAISING AND FALLING THE WHEELS IS VERY GOOD THOUGH BUT SELDOM USED AS THEY TELL ME FOR THEY WILL GO AT ALMOST ANY DEPTH OF WATER AND AS THE TIDE TURNS THE WHEELS GO THE SAME WAY WITH IT THESE MACHINES AT LONDONBRIDGE ARE FAR SUPERIOR TO THOSE SO MUCH FAMED AT MARLY IN FRANCE IN RE GARD THE LATTER ARE VERY ILL DESIGNED IN THEIR CRANKS AND SOME OTHER PARTS III EPISTOLA

SCHOOLS COMMITTEE OF THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION Procedure of the committeeThe Mississippi Valley Historical Association appointed the present committee in 1918 From the beginning the committee has acted on the principle that if its recommendations were to be of any real value they must be based upon facts Accordingly after delimiting its task as a study primarily of the existing facilities for and the prevailing practices in collateral reading in American history and modern European history the committee prepared a questionnaire for the purpose of discovering i the history books available in highschool libraries 2 the custom in duplicating titles 3 the books found most useful in these two fields by teachers and pupils 4 the amount of money expended for history books and 5 methods of checking collateral reading Thirteen states in the Mississippi Valley were included in the survey each state being represented by one member of the committee The questionnaires were circulated within each state by the local member of the committee who in most instances also tabulated wholly or in part the returns for his state and forwarded them to the chairman for final tabulation  The committee Howard C Hill University High School University of Chicago Chairman Alma Penrose Carleton College Northfield Minn E M Violette State Teachers College Kirksville Mo R M Tryon

should be addressed to the chairman 135136 THE SCHOOL REVIEW February The committee hoped to secure returns from each of the accredited or approved high schools in these states Although this hope was not realized a total of 520 secondary schools was heard from These schools are of all sortspublic high schools college preparatory schools laboratory schools military academies township high schools by far the greater number however are public secondary institutions They range in size from 16 pupils to 3289 pupils most of them contain from 200 to 6oo00 pupils They are located in communities whose populations vary from those of mere villages to those of cities like Cleveland Milwaukee Detroit and Chicago Although limited in number they may for these reasons be regarded as representative of the Middle West Character of the returnsThe questionnaires returned were in most instances filled out by the teacher of history usually by the head of the history department in the remaining cases they were answered bythe principal the superintendent or the librarian As may be anticipated the returns differ widely in value Some show signs of haste some are incomplete some contain glaring inaccuracies and inconsistencies and a considerable number have answers which are so vague as to be of little value But this sort is not the rule In general the questionnaires seem to have been filled out with care and contain unmistakable evidences of thought and time in their preparation Year in which American history is studiedFrom the returns it appears that American history is usually studied in the senior year of high school or in the junior and senior years Of the 46 schools reporting from Wisconsin for example 38 have American history in the senior year of high school 8 in the junior and senior years In Ohio 50 of the 59 schools reporting have American history in the senior year 6 have it in the senior and junior years i in the freshman year and 2 fail to state in which year it is given In a considerable number of the schools in Iowa and Missouri and to a less degree in those of Illinois there seems to be a tendency to offer American history only in the third year 17 of the 54 Iowa schools 9 of the 34 Missouri schools and 9 of the 126 Illinois schools so reportingI92I LIBRARY WORK AND EQUIPMENT FOR HISTORY 137 History textsAccording to the returns the texts in most favor in the states surveyed are with the number of schools using them as follows Muzzey American History 137 McLaughlin American Nation 87 Hart American History 68 Fite United States 66 James and Sanford American History 56 West American History 31 others are occasionally mentioned but none are given as many as 25 times In European history selections rank thus Robinson and Beard Outlines of European History Part II 153 West Modern World i21 Robinson History of Western Europe 53 Harding New Medieval and Modern History 40 Webster Modern Times 39 Myers Medieval and Modern History 29 occasionally other texts are mentioned but in no case are they given as often as 25 times Amount of collateral reading requiredIn answer to the question How much collateral reading is usually done per week  Indicate by pages or otherwise it is not uncommon to find such expressions as not much hard to get teachers to assign collateral not definite as much as can some very little library so inadequate can have no collateral reading not estimated in pages On the other hand a large proportion of the schools report from io to 30 pages of collateral reading in American history every week To quote the figures in Ohio we find that of the 59 schools reporting 23 require from io to 30 pages weekly 2 from 20 or 25 to 50 pages 4 50 pages or more I 6 pages i 5 pages while the 28 other schools either give no information on this point or use such vague expressions as difficult to estimate varies and not much In Wisconsin 28 of the 46 schools report from 10 to 30 pages weekly 6 from 15 to 75 pages i one and onehalf to two hours while the remaining ii are vague or silent on the point report very little or say below io pages Although the proportion varies the same general result appears in all the states which give sufficient data for forming a conclusion of any worth Among the individual answers possessing interest are those of a Nebraska school which reports its history study as all library work an Indiana school which requires one period daily in Reference Room a schoolin Kansas which requires ioo pages138 THE SCHOOL REVIEW February weekly and an Illinois school which requires 25 pages a week the first semester and 50 to ioo pages a week the second semester A considerable number of teachers do not require the reading of a certain number of pages weekly or monthly Says one Work not assigned by the week but by the subject Says another I have found the requirement of a certain number of pages unsatisfactory I assign individual topics Says a third I place much responsibility on the students Monthly topics are assigned and no references given From the principal of a school enrolling four hundred pupils this note of discouragement For many years we prided ourselves on our good historical library and for the amount of collateral reading that we appeared to extract from our pupils But during the last five years the pressure of other collateral activities of the social civic and economic order has made collateral reading impossible Also athletics the mania for the movies and for recreational activities all encouraged by the press and the public have tended to discourage reading to the point of disappearance Collateral reading although recommended and pressed for years is with the majority of our pupils a failure The checking of collateral readingThe methods of checking collateral reading most frequently listed in the returns are the written test notebook oral quiz recitation card report and special report given orally or in writing The usual report form is a printed card or slip to be turned in weekly sometimes daily On this form the pupil is asked to give in addition to his name and the date the author title and pages read during the week or day occasionally the topic on which the reading has been done must be stated sometimes the number of minutes spent in collateral reading is asked for In certain schools the report card also provides for a summary or list of the points not found in the text The following extracts from the returns are indicative of other methods teachers employ to check up collateral reading This term writes one each student has been asked to read one hour per week on a certain assigned topic to report in class orally or to hand in a brief written report Besides that each one read a biography of some famous American and wrote a review of it following an assigned outline For American history classes says another we have a conference on Fridays and each one shares the best things in the weeks reading Some read1921 LIBRARY WORK AND EQUIPMENT FOR HISTORY I39 more than a thousand pages I have followed the plan of assigning individual topics and calling for reports in class writes a third allowing the other members to take notes and holding them responsible also Other methods are Oral book reports on approved books a brief of the book read onepage written reports of the weeks reading written answers to questions floor talks term papers short summaries special written tests short papers on assigned topics one question in every test My reading assignments writes one teacher in an especially suggestive comment are made from day to day and are made a part of the lesson assignment They deal only with specific points that throw light on the lesson are definite and short They are discussed in recitation in their logical connection I have tried the method of requiring a certain number of pages of reading a week and have abandoned it frankly admitting that it does not accomplish the purposes sought In my experience such a plan does not really function in college even Required reading for English work in high school is not a success and similar require ments for history are less so Pupils as a rule will not read in a true sense ten pages of the usual sort of historical account Recognizing that give them an explicit reference on a particular point both of which are important enough to be worth the effort to learn and they will do that and do it conscientiously Weave this into its appropriate place in the recitation and there is no problem of checking up reading Money expended for history booksThe money expended annually for history books in the different states and among different schools in the same state varies widely In Illinois in the schools giving information on this point whose pupils number less than 500 the amount expended every year varies from o to a maximum of 200 to this statement there is one exception for one school of 460 pupils reports a yearly expenditure for books on history of from 400 to 500 In the schools containing between 500 and 1500 pupils the figures run from o to 400 annually while the few schools which number over 1500 pupils report an expendi ture of from 30 to 300140 THE SCHOOL REVIEW February In Wisconsin the money expended for history books in the schools which reported runs from o to 1oo a considerable number give 50 as the annual sum In Kansas such expenditures vary from none for years to 500 annually In Ohio the amount spent each year for history varies according to the returns from o to 400 annually In the schools which spend money for books the range is from io to 200 where the pupils number less than 500 and from very little to 400 where the number of pupils exceeds 500 Eight schools reported none  or very little 22 either gave no information or used such vague expressions as not much indefinite no set amount and varies One Ohio school reports that it depends on city library and teachers private libraries An Illirnis teacher writes Personally between fifty and one hundred dollars including my own duplicated extracts This comment is almost equaled by a Michigan teacher who states I find history coming last when money is to be spent I have filled in this year with my own books Of the 30 Indiana schools which reported on this question 6 spend no money or very little 6 spend from io to 15 and the remaining schools say the amount varies from year to year and name sums which range from io to 225 In the amount of money spent for history books Oklahoma appears to be the banner state among those surveyed In schools of less than 500 pupils the range is from 20 to 300 in schools between 50o and 1500 it runs from 150 to 300 and one school of more than 2000 pupils reports an expenditure of 5oo annually Practice in duplicating booksPractice in duplicating books varies widely In more than twothirds of the Missouri and the Nebraska secondary schools which reported titles are duplicated and in onehalf or more of the schools which sent returns from Indiana Wisconsin and Kansas a similar practice prevails Of the 33 Oklahoma schools included in the report 15 state that it is their practice to duplicate books I2 say they do not duplicate and 6 either give no information on the subject or answer in an indefinite fashion Of 57 Michigan schools 20 duplicate titles 18 do not and 19 fail to state their practice or give such indefinite answers as depends some and when necessary In1921 LIBRARY WORK AND EQUIPMENT FOR HISTORY 141 Illinois the proportion is about the same of the 126 schools which reported 50 purchase duplicates 35 do not 22 ignore the question and 19 give such answers as not often not entirely partly seldom if possible and sometimes In Iowa on the other hand the prevailing practice seems adverse to duplication 17 out of 54 schools report that they do not duplicate titles and 6 reply not often  no special policy not always not much and partly only 12less than onefourth of the schoolsgive an affirmative answer A similar situation prevails apparently in Minnesota out of 25 schools 7 report duplication while 12 reply in the negative The prevailing usage in Ohio likewise is adverse to duplication only 13 of the 59 schools which reported practice it whereas 22 do not observe it From the figures at hand it appears therefore that about twothirds of the schools duplicate the books they find most useful while the remainder follow the practice of most libraries and merely multiply titles In the schools in which books are duplicated the number of copies bought ranges from one for every two pupils taking the subject to one for every thirty pupils One Illinois school with a student body of 1200 it is true reports that it purchases one copy for every pupil and then adds when not possible then for every two or three Evidently this school has never found it possible to secure a copy for every pupil since elsewhere in the questionnaire it appears that while 103 pupils take American history 40 copies is the largest number of duplicates of any one book in the school library In most of the schools the common practice seems to be to buy one copy for every three to seven pupils Of the 15 Oklahoma schools which duplicate books ii for example purchase them in such quantities Twelve of the 24 Wisconsin schools which dupli cate books follow a similar practice Like results appear in the returns from Michigan Nebraska Arkansas Iowa Indiana and Illinois Selection of history booksIn the selection of history books the practice in many schools is to cooperate with the other depart ments especially with the English department In Oklahoma142 THE SCHOOL REVIEW February all of the schools which reported except two state that they co operate with other departments usually with the department of English of the two exceptions one reports that selections are made by librarian with faculty and the other says English department will not cooperate this year In Wisconsin sixteen of the fortysix schools reporting state they too select books by cooperating with the other departments but fourteen schools do not report any cooperation In some cases selections of books are made by the highschool librarian school board principal superintendent and frequently by the individual history teachers In these cases it is interesting and encouraging to notice that in many instances selections are based on book reviews in periodicals university lists state courses of study Tryons list and lists of historical societies Relations with public librariesThe relations of the schools with the public libraries in their communities are instructive and suggestive In every state except Arkansas Tennessee and Oklahoma the majority of the schools make use of the public library and the schools reporting from Arkansas and Tennessee are too few to warrant any conclusions In an encouraging number of cases the public librarians indicate a willingness to cooperate with the schools by keeping books on reserve for high school pupils and by loaning books to the high school Usually such books are furnished in quantities of less than ten In a few instances books are loaned in quantities up to fifty and even one hundred copies In a number of schools the school library is a branch of the public library The most useful history booksIn outlining its work the com mittee felt it could do nothing of greater service than to discover the books which teachers of history have found most valuable for highschool use With this in view the following question was included in the questionnaire Name at least ten books if pos sible which you have found most useful for a intensive reading study or information b extensive reading atmosphere or enjoyment reading as distinguished from study The list for extensive reading should include the books which are most popular with students Books in the fields of American history and modern European history were asked forZ92I LIBRARY WORK AND EQUIPMENT FOR HISTORY 143 In the list below are given in the order of their utility as shown by the returns all the books in the field of American

instances Harts Epochs of American History was named These were all credited to Harts Formation of the Union but the teachers who thus reported may have had in mind the entire series of three volumes following the same practice the questionnaire which mentioned Thwaites Epochs of American History was credited to Thwaitess The Colonies and the one which named Wilsons Epochs of American History was added to Wilsons Division and Reunion Wide disagreement appeared as to the best books in American history for extensive reading atmosphere or enjoyment or reading as distinguished from study In many instances the extensive references were practically as heavy as the intensive one teacher in fact declared there was and should be no difference between the two Nothing could show more clearly the need for attention to this neglected phase of history teaching The following list includes all books mentioned fifteen or more times144 THE SCHOOL REVIEW February BOOKS USEFUL FOR EXTENSIVE READING IN

mentioned as many as 25 times are included Since some teachers limited their selection to works dealing with modern European history the intention of the committee while others included those treating

this list deals with the history of commerce Days History of Commerce was mentioned only five times Herricks History of Commerce and Industry but six times The list for extensive reading in European history is very unsatisfactory Many of the questionnaires included no returns on the subject and there was wide variation among those that did report It is perhaps worth noting that Abbott Miihlbach and Henty received frequent mention it will also be seen that more than onethird of the list consists of historical novels The tabulation includes all books given as many as ten times BOOKS FOR

Friar of Wittenberg  i0 16 Scott Talisman    10146 THE SCHOOL REVIEW February Conclusions of the committeeThe conclusions and recommenda tions of the committee in the light of this survey are as follows i Effective history teaching is impossible without an adequate supply of collateral reading material This conclusion is based on the fact that there are certain fundamental values in the study of history that cannot be attained without a large amount of collateral reading These values are the stimulation or creation of a taste for historical literature a knowledge of how to use books an acquaintance with the different forms in which historical materials are recorded and the cultivation of an independent and critical attitude toward modern social economic and political problems To attain these ends it is necessary for pupils to study certain topics with greater thoroughness than the text permits to write brief historical papers to read portions of the more vivid sources and some of the best historical poetry and fiction and to become acquainted with the writings of at least a few of the great historians These purposes cannot be attained if the pupil is limited to a single book Moreover when the work in history is confined to a single text instruction too often becomes a mere memoriter process and the pupil grows weary with repeated requirements for outlines sum maries and digests The ordinary highschool text in history as Judd has pointed out consists of approximately six hundred pages much of which is usually of such a highly condensed and abstract character as to be unintelligible to the average boy or girl It is moreover so limited in amount that it can be read aloud by most highschool pupils in from forty to fortyfive hours or read silently three times in from fortyfive to fifty hours silent reading usually being approximately three times as rapid as oral reading Thus a book which is intended for a years work affords material fitted at best so far as quantity is concerned for two or three months work To illuminate and vivify the encyclopedic pages of the text therefore as well as to give pupils a quantity of material worthy of their efforts an adequate supply of collateral reading is essential 2 The books available in all but a few of the best equipped schools are insufficient for effective supplementary reading in1921 LIBRARY WORK AND EQUIPMENT FOR HISTORY 147 history As one member of the committee puts it There seems to be an appalling scarcity of available laboratory material for history teaching The questionnaires are filled with such com ments as impossible to do as much collateral reading as we would like for lack of books no school library little collateral reading due to lack of equipment not enough books no duplicates Without duplication of usable books in fact it is impossible to do effective work in supplementary reading Books which are intended for intensive use should be provided in such quantities as to furnish one copy for every three to eight pupils those intended for extensive use should be supplied so as to provide one copy for every eight to fifteen pupils History teachers are in the majority of cases too modest in their demands for library equipment Elaborately equipped domes tic science botany physics and chemistry laboratories and even more elaborately furnished manualtraining and shop rooms are by no means as scarce in good high schools as wellequipped history libraries History teachers must convince administrative officers that their subject can no more be taught effectively without equipment than can physics domestic science manual training botany or chemistry 3 Many titles in highschool libraries are ill suited for high school pupils Among these may be mentioned such works as Ridpaths History of the United States Johnsons Readings in American Constitutional History Burgess Reconstruction and the Constitution and the Cambridge Modern History Nor is it wise in the judgment of the committee to make a general practice of using other highschool texts as collateral reading as a rule they too are condensed and abstract and furnish little more than a rehash of what the pupil has already read in his own text 4 The numerous requests for lists of books as well as the character of many of the titles mentioned in the questionnaires I In this connection attention is called to the general statement of standards of highschool library administration and equipment as found in Certains Standard Library Organization and Equipment for Secondary Schools of Diferent Sizes pp 16 23 24 This report was adopted by the Department of Secondary Education of the National Education Association and has been approved by the Committee on Education of the American Library Association148 THE SCHOOL REVIEW February lead the committee to believe that there is a wide interest and serious need for suggestions as to the works best suited for collateral reading in history To aid in meeting this need the committee ventures to recommend two lists of books as comprising works which in its judgment are adapted for intensive reading in American history and modern European history In justification of these lists the committee offers four reasons first the books selected provide material for the economic social and political phases of the fields of history to be studied second they are in general written in a style intelligible and interesting to highschool pupils third they are scholarly and accurate and fourth they are comparatively inexpensivea matter which is vital especially if as the committee hopes the books recommended are purchased in duplicate LIST OF BOOKS RECOMMENDED FOR INTENSIVE READING IN AMERICAN HISTORY I R G Thwaites The Colonies 2 A

EQUIPMENT FOR HISTORY 149 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR EXTENSIVE READING Judging from the returns many teachers interpret extensive reading to mean the perusal of such heavy detailed allinclusive works as the Historians History of the World or Cambridge Modern History From the viewpoint of the committee however such reading should rather be of the sort which is easily within the grasp of pupils which is written in a way to appeal to their interests and emotions and which will give them a feeling of the reality of historical times and persons It should in short consist of fascinating stories biographies diaries source extracts and historical novels Among the books dealing with American history which the committee recommends as useful for providing the mental back ground just mentioned are the following Chestnut A Diary of Dixie Charnwood Life of Abraham Lincoln Dana Two Years before the Mast Drinkwater Abraham Lincoln Earle Child Life in Colonial Days Ford The True George Washington Bassett The Story of Lumber Brooks The Story of Cotton Larcom A New England Girlhood Russell My Diary North and South Brady The True Andrew Jackson Ripley Social Life in Old New Orleans Elson Sidelights on American History Nicolay Boys Life of Lincoln Hagedorn Boys Life of Roosevelt Laut Pathfinders of the West Haworth George Washington Farmer Lodge and Roosevelt Heroes of American History Sanford Story of Agri culture in the United States Roosevelt Episodes from the Winning of the West various volumes in the works of Parkman and Fiske selected passages from McMaster and Rhodes and such historical novels as Churchills The Crisis Johnstons Lewis Rand Houghs Fiftyfour Forty or Fight Wisters The Virginian Garlands A Little Norsk Fords The Honorable Peter Sterling and Thompsons Alice of Old Vincennes For extensive reading in modern European history the following titles are recommended Simpson Rise of Louis Napoleon Mathews French Revolution Rose Life of Napoleon I Smiles Lives of the Inventors Green Short History of the English People Henderson Short History of Germany Peat Private Peat Trevel yan Garibaldi and the Thousand Motley Life of Peter the Great150 THE SCHOOL REVIEW Southey Life of Nelson Tappan In Days Victorian Wallace Wonderful Century and such novels as Reades Cloister and the Hearth Kingsleys Westward Ho Blackmores Lorna Doone Dickens Little Dorrit Davis Friar of Wittenberg Eliots Silas Marner and Thackerays Henry Esmond 5 Close cooperation between secondary schools and public libraries is very desirable both in helping solve the problem of an adequate supply of books and in acquainting pupils with the facilities and attractions of their own local library Such co operation may be brought about in several ways i The public library may withdraw from circulation and place upon a reserved shelf such books as a history class needs at a certain time 2 The library may send selected books to the school where they can be used more conveniently by the pupils 3 The two institutions may cooperate in ordering new books so as to avoid needless duplication of titles Of course all three plans may be used In one city the public librarian made an exhaustive bibliography covering a large period of history from which the students derived references for the study of special topics thus a class of sixtyfive members was assisted in finding its materials In another instance the public library employs an experienced teacher to serve at the library during the evening for the purpose of assisting students in history and other subjects such a plan is admirable 6 Collateral reading must be regularly checked to be most effective It is the belief of the committee that a method that most closely relates informational or intensive reading to the regular work as it moves along from day to day is best To accomplish this collateral reading of the intensive sort should be assigned definitely with exact page references so as to constitute an integral part of the required work it should then have a definite place in the recitation For the checking of atmospheric or extensive reading a card report plus an occasional day devoted to the discussion of such material is recommended

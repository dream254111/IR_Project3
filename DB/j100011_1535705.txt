j100011,Biological Bulletin,1535705,On Phoronis Pacifica sp nov,i268213,ON PHORONIS PACIFICA SP NOV HARRY BEAL TORREY DURING the past summer eight specimens of Phoronis came into my hands Five were collected in June I894 in Humboldt Bay California by an expedition from the University of Cali fornia Three were brought back from Puget Sound by the Columbia University expedition of I897 As the occurrence of Phoronis on the Pacific coast has never been recorded and it is eminently desirable that all localities in which this interesting form may be obtained should be made known to naturalists I have undertaken to describe this material which represents a single species hitherto unknown The following table will indicate the distribution and date of first description of all the known species of Phoronis For the species presently to be described I propose the name Ppacifica P hippocrepia Str Wright I856 Great Britain P ovalis   1856 P Crepina gracilis Van Ben2 I858 P Buskii McIntosh8 88I

apparently unknown to him though descriptions of both were published before the date of his manuscript P Sabatieri is known to me only through a meager description It differs from the other European forms in size and habit and approaches P architecta in these respects The latter possesses the simple lophophore and comparatively small number of tentacles 60 of the European species It may be distinguished from them with the exception of P Sabatieri with which it may prove identical by its larger size its straight tubes and solitary habit its strong longitudinal muscles excepting P psammophila the presence of a ciliated groove in the digestive tract and possibly by a separation of the sexes While it agrees fairly well with P Buskii in size it differs from that species in the other char acters enumerated as well as in the complexity of the lopho phore and the number of tentacles It is thus more closely allied to the European than to the Australian and Philippine forms The differences between P australis and P Buskii are merely of habit and size which has caused Benham to suggest their identity on the supposition that these differences are due to dissimilar environmental conditions The description of the Japanese species has been inaccessible so that I can state nothing with regard to it save its existence It is an interesting fact that no one has cared to segregate the species of Phoronis under more than one generic name and indicates the trifling character of the differences which serve to distinguish them We may separate them however into two groups widely separated geographically In the one belong the European forms including perhaps the American P architecta In the other belong P australis and P Buskii We may dis regard the Japanese species on account of dearth of information and the P psammophila which Haswell has found at Port Jack son and which may have been brought from the Mediterranean on a ships bottom P pacifica occupies a place intermediate between these two groups both geographically and anatomically but is somewhat 284 TORRE Y VOL IINo 6 PHORONIS PA CIFICA 285 more closely related to the American than to the Australian species In size it resembles P Buskii as well as in the com plexity of the lophophore though instead of three coils in the FIG s  Diagrammatic crosssections of the lophophores of P austalis

though this does not pass into the groove that Andrews describes in the structure of the nervous sys tem lophophore organ and tube in habit and in the possible separation of the sexes It is not my intention to enter into a full and detailed anatomical description of Pizoro nis which the labors of Benham and Cori have rendered largely unnecessary But a few words on some points may not be out of

were monoecious or  dioecious In one nephridium three ova were found unaccompanied by sperma tozoa the first polar body was forming in one As there was no sign of sperma  tozoa in these eggs it is probable that in FIG 4Crosssection of the this species fertilization takes place either oesophagus of P Sfacica shlowing the ridge its base in externally or within the nephridium It contact with the

stomach either as a ridge or a groove In Figs 2 4 it is indicated in section where it appears to be a shallow groove an appearance probably due to the folding of the wall of the oesophagus Its position relative to the longitudinal blood vessels is identical with that described for P architecta The nuclei stain more intensely with haematoxylin than the other nuclei of the oesophagus and are crowded together usually in several layers These facts make the area quite conspicuous in section The muscles reach their greatest development in the oral third of the body where they form more than eighty high narrow ridges In   the aboral third these are reduced FIG 5Semidiagrammatic crosssection to a very inconspicuous layer though of lophophore organ within the concav still retaining their identity being ity of the lophophore separated throughout their length by characteristic folds of peritoneal epithelium There is a delicate peritoneum covering the muscle ridges the nuclei only Fig 3 n being seen with ordinary powers of magnification Occasionally a similar nucleus is found within the fold of muscle n The nervous system is constructed as in P architecta with one interesting exception The two longitudinal cords which are of exceedingly unequal length instead of ending in the nerve ring of the lophophore are continuous across the median line at the level of the median mass of ganglion cells The loop thus formed is closely applied posteriorly to the latter and touches the lophophore nerve on each side of the rectum appar ently without fusing at either point Just how intimate this contact is cannot be determined from my poorly fixed material The brevity of the descriptions of this portion of the nervous system in P architecta and other species leads me to suspect that the seemingly exceptional condition in P pacifica may prove to be of more general occurrence 287 No 6TORREY The lophophore organ is extremely variable and may be present or absent as in P psammophila It may resemble that of P australis though differing somewhat in shape Fig 5 In this case it is simple with a thickened glandular epithelium lying for the most part against the inner circle of tentacles and an outer free nonglandular edge of much lower cells In another case however it had the form of the same organ in P architecta and P psammophila as described and figured by Andrews and Cori being composed of a basal lobe and a distal  carpellike organ This condition seems to have been attained by the addition of the carpellike organ to the structure basal lobe which corresponds to the entire organ in P australis The following is a diagnosis of the species from material preserved in alcohol and formalin Total length may be 9 cm of which the tentacles represent from 21 to 4 mm Diameter I to 2 mm Lophophore spirally coiled each spiral possessing from i  to 2 complete turns Tentacles I 70 to 200 Lophophore organ present or absent extremely variable in form

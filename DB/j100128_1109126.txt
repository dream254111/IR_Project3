the legal title has not passed to the converter but if it had passed it would still be impressed with the trust in favor of the second mortgagee whose action in personam would then be against the sheriff on the equity side of the court The proper dis position of the case is suggested by LAUGHLIN J dissenting IMPERFECT IDENTIFICATION OF VENDEE INDORSEE OR CONSIGNEE There is in several branches of the law a situation created by fraud in which uncertainty exists as to whether an ostensible party to a transaction was intended to be such by the actor When B repre senting himself as C obtains from A the sale of chattels or the indorsement of a draft or the shipment of goods by carrier does he thereby get title or become the indorsee or the consignee so as to protect an innocent third party to whom he transfers the goods or the bank that pays him the draft or the cariier that delivers the goods to him Each case supposed involves the analysis of intention with a view to determining substantially the same question viz what person has the actor singled out to receive the benefit of a legal disposition he has made or purported to make Parity of reason dictates that there should be uniformity of decision upon the point in all three branches of the law Where the trans action is inter praesentes and the impostor acts in his own right and not as agent for another it is almost universally held that he has succeeded in obtaining rights through the transaction under which innocent third parties will be protected Robertson v Coleman I886 I4I Mass 231 Land Title and Trust Co v N W National Bank I900 I96 Pa 230 Dunbar v Boston etc R R Co I876 IIo Mass 26 Tollman v American Nat Bk I90o 52 L R A 877 contra In such a situation it may fairly be argued that the vendee payee or consignee intended by the plaintiff in any other than a highly metaphysical sense was the person before him objectively identified as such By his actual physical presence B has substituted himself effectively for the abstract personality in As mind When the party misrepresenting himself negotiates from a distance however a more intricate question is raised If he com municates by letter in the name of an actual person known to the plaintiff and the plaintiff as a result sends a check is the check intended for the known party or for the impostor who wrote the letter This question was squarely before the Nebraska court in the recent case of Hoffman v American Exchange Bank I903 96 N W II2 An executor making final distribution of an estate advertised for a certain legatee C of whose whereabouts he was ignorant desiring to remit a balance due him He had previously made two payments to C one by mail and one in person Receiving from an impostor a letter purporting to come from C the plaintiff sent a draft indorsed specially to C to the address given The Court improperly it seems refused to allow him to recover from the bank 580NVO TES which paid the draft to the impostor In negotiations inter absentes there is obviously not that complete identification of the other party which exists where the impostor appears in person Here the ven dor indorser or consignor may often intend to deal with a person identified in his mind partly by attributes of the man personated partly by attributes of the impostor For example in the principal case the plaintiff may have identified the person to whom he intended to indorse partly by attributes of the real legatee partly by attributes of the man from whom he received the letter and address To the validity of a disposition to an impostor it would seem necessary that he must show that the attribute which was the determining factor of identification was one that applied to him exclusively If there is a conflict attributes of each furnishing substantial factors of identification or if the determining attribute is one of the man he is personating the impostormust fail B has not succeeded in substituting his own personality for that of C in the mind of A and consequently cannot be said to have been selected as vendee indorsee or consignee Where as in the principal case the actor had actually met the man personated it would seem that nothing short of the actual presence of the impostor should be allowed to effect such a substitution Certainly his mere handwriting should not be held to effect it And this is generally held to be the law Amerzcan Express Co v Slack I867 29 Ind 27 Cundy v Lindsay 1878 L R 3 A C 459 The difficult problems arise where the vendor indorser or consignor has no personal acquaintance with either the man personated or the impostor It would seem that they should be solved by the application of the principles stated above EQUITY JURISDICTION OVER THE ASSIGNMENT OF CHOSES IN ACTIONReflecting primitive social conditions the Common Law found no necessity for affording a means of transferring rights and obligations arising out of a claim in personam Increasing com plexity of commercial ties however involved finding a means of assigning such rights Singularly enough the English courts ap parently independently adopted to this end the device of the Roman Law the letter of attorney The prosecution of a civil action through an agent was already familiar To give a third party an interest in a chose in action such as he could have ac quired had the same been assignable was to a great extent accom plished by appointing him an agent with power to collect the claim for his own use By the middle of the thirteenth century we find assignments by power of attorney recognized in the English courts of law 2 Pollock and MIaitland History of Engl Law 2267 The interest of the creditoragent being entirely dependent upon the will of his pseudoprincipal was however

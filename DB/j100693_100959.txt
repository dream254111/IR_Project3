SINCE MONS CHARAS HIS REPLY TO THE LETTER WRITTEN BY SIGNOR FRANCESCO REDI TO MONSTEUR BOURDELET AND MONSIEUR MORUS,I206872,AN EXTRACT OF A LETTER WRITTEN TO THE PUBLISHER BY MR THOMAS PLATT FROM FLORENCE AUGUST 6 1672 CONCERNING SOME EXPERI MENTS THERE MADE UPON VIPERS SINCE MONS CHARAS HIS REPLY TO THE LETTER WRITTEN BY SIGNOR FRANCESCO REDI TO MONSIEUR BOUR DELET AND MONSIEUR MORUS SIR I SHALL BEGIN WITH TELLING YOU THAT IN A CONVERSATION LAST WIN TER WHERE I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO MAKE ONE OF THE NUM BER THE DISCOURSE WAS OF AN OPINION OF M DELA CHAMBREWHO TO5061 TO PROVE THAT THE SPIRITS ARE ANIMATED ALLEDGES AMONG OTHER ARGUMENTS THEIR APTNESS TO DISCERN BY WHICH HE SUPPOSES THAT IN THE HEAT OF THEIR ANGER THEY GATHER THE POISON FROM THE SEVERAL PARTS OF THE BLOOD AND THEREWITH CONVEY THEMSELVES TO THE TEETH OF THE IRRITATED ANIMAL FROM WHENCE THEY ARE AF TERWARDS TRANSFUSED INTO THE WOUND BY BITING THIS CONCEIT WAS BY SOME OF THE COMPANY RECEIVED WITH MUCH APPLAUSE BE CAUSE THEY KNEW HOW DIFFICULT A THING IT WASTO COME TO AN EX PLANATION OF THAT POISON WHICH M DELA CHAMBRE MAKES MENTI ON OF IN GENERAL THAT THE SPIRITS PROCEED FROM THE BLOOD OF THE IRRITATED ANIMAL SO THEY AGREED PAUCIS MUTATIS HENCE TO FRAME A NEW HYPOTHESIS SAYING THAT SUCH POISON IS NOTHING ELSE BUT A NEW AND MALIGNANT ACTIVITY OF THE SAME SPIRITS WHILST THEY ARE VEXED AND BENT TOWARDS REVENGE ASSERTING THE TRUTH OF SUCH IDEAL EFFECTS WITH DIVERS EXAMPLES AS THAT OF THE TOAD THE WEESEL THE MAD DOG THE SPIDER OF PUGLIA C WHICH WERE ALL FOUND VERY WEAK AND UNCONCLUDING WHEREFORE MOST OF THE GENTLEMEN DID INCLINE TO ENTERTAIN MONS DELA CHAMBRES FIRST FUNDAMENTAL OPINION SINCE AT LEAST THAT SUPPOSES THAT THOSE ANIMALSTHAT POISON BY THEIR BITING HAVE ALREADY A REAL POYSON WITHIN THEMSELVES AND THAT ANGER WORKS NO OTHER EFFECT BUT TO GATHER ALL THE VENOMOUS PARTS TOGETHER IN ONE PARTICULAR PLACE WHENCE THEY MAY EASILY BE INSTILLD INTO THE WOUNDS MADE BY THE TEETH FOR ALL THIS AS IT MOST COMMONLY HAPPENS IN SUCH DISCOUR SES EVERYONE REMAIND IN HIS OWN OPINION AND MENTION HA VING BEEN MADE OF THAT OF SIGNOR REDIS HELD IN HIS BOOK OF VIPERS WHICH FOR SEVERAL YEARS PASSES IN THIS COUNTRY ALMOST FOR AN UNDOUBTED TRUTH VIZ THAT THE VIPERS POISON CONSISTS IN SOME THING INCOMPATIBLE WITH THIS NEW ALLAY OF M DELA CHAM BRES OPINION REDUCED TO THE IRRITATED SPIRITS THOUGH NOT WITH THAT OF HIS WHICH IS TAKEN PURELY FROM ITS FIRST GROUNDS THIS GAVE OCCASION TO A NEW DEBATE CONCERNING THE VALIDITY OF SINNOR REDIS ASSERTION SO GENERALLY RECEIVED HERE SOME SAY ING IT WOULD DO WELL TO EXAMINE THE GROUNDS OF IT UPON THIS IT WAS RESOLVED THAT ALL MIGHT BE SATISFIEDTO COME TO A TRYAL AS SOON AS THE SPRING WOULD GIVE LEAVE TO VIPERS TO APPEAR ABROAD NOW SIR YOU MUST KNOW THAT BEING AT THE HOUSE OF SIGN MAGALOTTI ON THE 2D OF JUNE LAST THERE CAME DR FRANCINI WHO HAD FORMERLY BEEN ONE OF THE MOST RESOLUTE ASSERTORS OF THIS G G G G G 2 OPINION5062 OPINION OF SIGNOR REDI CONCERNING THE POISON OF VIPERS AND BEING COME HE SENT TO HIS LODGING FOR A BOX IN WHICH THERE WERE A GREAT MANY HEADS CUT OFF THAT MORNING OF VIPERS LATE LY COME FROM NAPLES HE IMMEDIATELY DESIRED TO HAVE SOME ANIMALS TO BEGIN HIS EXPERIMENTS UPON BUT THERE BEING AT THAT TIME NO OTHER COMPANY WITH SIGNOR MAGALOTTI BUT HIS BRO THER AND IIT WAS THOUGHT FIT TO STAY TILL NEXT MORNINGTHAT THOSE GENTLEMEN WHO WERE AT THE DISPUTE LAST WINTER MIGHT BE PRE SENT AS IT FELL OUT THEY WERE I THAT HAD NOT SO MUCH PATIENCE DESIRED THE DOCTOR TO MAKE AT LEAST ONE EXPERIMENT WHICH BEING GRANTED SIGNOR MAGA LOTTI WAS PLEASED TO SEND TO THE PUBLICK MARKET FOR A COUPLE OF PIGEONS TO BE SURE OF HAVING SOMETHAT WERE NOT PREVENTED BY ANY ANTIDOTE THE PIGEONS BEING COME THE FIRST WAS WOUN DED WITH THE TEETH OF A VIPERS HEAD THAT HAD BEEN CUT OFF A BOUT 7 OR 8 A CLOCK THE SAME MORNING THE WAY OF MAKING THE WOUND WAS BY THRUSTING TWICE THE MASTERTEETH INTO THE FLESHY PART OF THE PIGEONS BREAST TILL SUCH TIME AS PRESSING THE UPPER PART OF THE JAW THE TWO LITTLE BLADDERS THAT SERVE AS GUMS TO THE TEETH DID EMPTY OUT UPON THE WOUND SOME OF THAT YELLOW LIQUOR WHICH HERE IS SUPPOSD TO BE THE TRUE AND ONLY POISON OF THE VIPER THIS PIGEON BEING THUS BIT AND SET UPON THE GROUND BEGAN TO STAGGER IMMEDIATELY AND DY ED IN LESS THEN 3 OR 4 MINUTES THE SECOND PIGEON WAS WOUN DED IN THE SAME MANNER BUT AT THE FIRST WOUND THERE ONLY EN TRED ONE OF THE TEETH WHICH BROUGHT FORTH A GREAT DEAL OF BLOOD THE SECOND TIME THEY BOTH ENTERD AND THIS HAD THE SAME FATE WITH THIS DIFFERENCE ONLY THAT HE LANGUISHT HALF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR THE NEXT MORNING THERE MET AT SIGNOR MAGALOTTIS CHAMBERS BESIDES THE COMPANY OF THE DAY BEFORE SIGNOR CARLO DATI SIGN VINCENZO VIVIANI SIGN PAOLO DELL ARA DR SAVONA DR NERI DR FABRINI AND SOME OTHERS WHEREUPON SIX PIGEONS AND A COCK HAVING BEEN BROUGHT THE FIRST THING THAT DR FRANCINI DID WAS TO THRUST SEVERAL THORNS OF ROSE SHRUBBS INTO THE BREAST OF ONE OF THOSE PIGEONS TO MANIFEST THAT SUCH ACCIDENTS AS MIGHT BEFALL THOSE THAT SHOULD BE WOUNDED BY THE TEETH OF THE DEAD VIPERS WERE NOT MEERLY CAUSED BY THE WOUND AND WHEREAS ONE OF THE COMPANY BEGAN TO MAKE SOME NICE REFLEXIONS AND TO TAKE SOME OF THE HEADS TO MEASURE THE JUST PROPORTIONS OF THEIR5063 THEIR TEETH TO SEE WHAT DIFFERENCE THERE MIGHT BE BETWIXT THEM AND THE THORNS THIS MADE THE DOCTOR LOOSE PATIENCE AND SOON TAKING A PIN WHICH WAS NONE OF THE LEAST HE GAVE TO THE FIRST PIGEON THAT HE COULD LAY HANDS ON A VERY DEEP WOUND IN THE BREAST WHICH NO SOONER WAS GOT FREE BUT BEGAN TO LEAP  FRISK ABOUT THE ROOM AS IF IT HAD NOT BEEN CONCERND IN THE LEAST AFTER THIS THEY BEGAN IN GOOD EARNEST FOR ANOTHER PI GEON WAS TAKEN AND BIT IN THE BREAST BY BOTH THE MASTERTEETH OF A VIPERS HEAD THAT HAD BEEN CUT OFF THE MORNING BEFORE THE EXECUTION BEING EXACTLY LIKE THAT OF THE DAY BEFORE THE EF FECT WASTHAT THE PIGEON HAD THE SAME SHAKING FITS AFTER WHICH FALLING UPON HIS BELLY HE DIED GIVING SIGNES A LITTLE BE FORE OF A PAINFUL AGONY BY HIS OFTEN GAPING HIS END WAS NOT ONLY VERY SENSIBLE TO HIM BUT ALSO MORE TEDIOUS THAN THAT OF THE OTHER DAY FOR THIS LIVED 5 OR 6 MINUTES AFTER HIS WOUND ANOTHER HAVING BEEN SERVD AFTER THE SAME MANNER WITH ANO THER HEAD HAD THE LIKE ACCIDENTS AND DIED WITHIN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR THIS OBSERVATION WAS MADE ON THIS OTHER THAT HIS WOUND LET OUT A GREAT DEAL OF BLOOD WHEREAS NOT SO MUCH AS ONE DROP WAS SEEN TO COME OUT OF ANY OF THE OTHERS ALL THIS APPEARING AS YET BUT LITTLE TO THE DOCTOR TO EXCLUDE THE DOCTRINE OF SPIRITS WHICH NOW BEGAN TO LOOSE GROUND AF TER SO MANY EXPERIMENTS OF DEAD VIPERS HEADS HE TOOK THREE STALKS OUT OF A BROOM AND HAVING SMOOTHED THEM AND SHARP ND THEM AT THE ENDS AFTER THE MANNER OF A LANCET HE DREW FROM THE GUMS OF SEVERAL HEADS ENOUGH OF THAT YELLOW JUICE TO DAWBE TWO OF THOSE STALKES WHICH BEING THUS MOISTNED WITH THAT LIQUOR WERE BOTH PUT INTO THEBREASTS OF TWO PIGEONS AND THERE LEFT THE LIKE HAVING BEEN DONE TO ANOTHER WITH THE 3D STALK NOT COVERD WITH THAT JUICE WHICH WAS AT LEAST ONE THIRD PART BIGGER AND LONGER THAN THE OTHER TWO IN A WORD THE TWO FIRST DIED WITHIN 4 OR 5 MINUTES AND THE LAST CONTINUES TO THIS VERY DAY IN SIGNOR MAGALOTTIS PIGEONHOUSE AS BRISK AND AS FAT AS EVER HIS WOUND IN HIS BREAST INSTEAD OF HAVING CAU SED AN INFLAMMATION IS NOW ALMOST PERFECTLY HEALED WHILST THESE EXPERIMENTS WERE MAKING IT CAME INTO THE HEADS OF SOME TO TRY ANOTHERUPON THE RELATION THAT SIGN PAOLO DELL ARA LATELY COME FROM PARIS HAD MADE WHICH WAS THAT SOME HAD ASSERTED THERE THAT TO SWALLOW A VIPERS HEAD WAS A MOST CERTAIN PRESERVATIVE AND REMEDY AGAINST THE BITING OF A VIPER5064 VIPER DR FRANCINI SMILED AT THAT PHANCY BUT TO GIVE FULL SATISFACTION ABOUT IT HE MADE TWO EXPERIMENTS THE ONE WAS BY MAKING THE COCK THAT WAS THERE TO SWALLOW A VIPERS HEAD AND THEN CAUSING HIM TO BE WELL BITTEN IN BOTH THIGHS BY A LIVE ONE BUT THE COCK CONTINUING SOME TIME BEFORE HE GAVE ANY SIGNS OF SICKNESS NOT TO LOOSE TIME HE PASSD TO THE OTHER EX PERIMENT BY THRUSTING THE TEETH OF A DEAD VIPERS HEAD INTO ANOTHER PIGEON THAT HAD BEFORE GOT DOWN ONE OF THOSE HEADS INTO HIS BELLY THE CONCLUSION WAS THAT BOTH DYED THE COCK WITHIN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR THEPIGEON IN LESS THAN 4 MINUTES THE NEWS OF THESE EXPERIMENTS MADE MANY PERSONS CURIOUS TO SEE THEM PERFORMD ONCE MORE SO THAT SOME FEW DAYS AF TER A RENDEZVOUS WAS MADE IN SIGNMAGALOTTISGARDEN WHERE BESIDES THE FORENAMED PERSONS MET MR THOMAS FREDERICK MR JOHN GODSCALL TWO ENGLISH GENTLEMEN ABBOT STROZZI HIS MOST CHRISTIAN MAJESTIES PUBLICK MINISTER IN THIS COURTSIGN PAOLO FALCONIERIFIRST GENTLEMAN OF THE BED CHAMBER TO THE G DUKESIGN LUIGI DEL RICCIO MONSPELLETIERMONS MORELLE THE ONE PHISITIAN AND THE OTHER CHIRURGION TO THE G DUTCHESS DR GORNIA PHYSITIAN IN ORDINARY TO HIS HIGHNESS DR BELLINI PROFESSOR OF ANATOMY AT PISA SIGN LORENZO LORENZINI A MA THEMATICIAN AND SIGN PIETRO SALVETTI BUT BY THE BY GIVE ME LEAVE TO TELL YOUFOR SOME DIVERSION THAT THIS SIGN SALVETTI WHO IS ONE OF THE G DUKES MUSITIANS  PLAYS ON ALL BOW INSTRUMENTSINVENTED ABOUT 4 YEARS AGO A NEW TUNING OF THE ANTIENT LIRA VIOL WITH THE USUAL 13 STRINGS BY MEANS OF WHICH TUNING IT IS RENDRED WHOLLY PERFECT SO THAT YOU MAY EXPRESS UPON IT ALL CONCORDS DISCORDS AND ALSO THE IMPERFECT CONCORDS AS SEAVENTHS FIXTHS C AS WELL AS UPON ANY VIRGINAL THAT HATH THE QUARTERS OF NOTES UPON IT TIS TRUE TIS ONLY FOR MELANCHOLLY AND PASSIONAT MATTERAND NOT FOR DI VISION AS IS THE PROPER NATURE OF THE LIRA I SHALL ONLY ADD THAT WITH THE ABOVESAID TUNING HE ASCENDS IN ALTE AS HIGH AS G SOL RE UT AND DESCENDS AS LOW AS DOUBLE C SOL FA UT AND CAN MAKE EVERY WHERE THE SAME CONCORDS AS ABOVE THIS SAME PERSON HAVING APPLIED HIMSELF TO THE STUDY OF THE MATHEMATICKSAND PARTICULARLY ABOUT THE PROPORTIONS OFHARMO NYRELATING TO HIS PROFESSION OF MUSICK BEGAN TO DELIGHT HIMSELF IN OPTICKS AND OTHER PARTS AND NOT BEING CONTENT WITH THE THEORYHE WENT ON TO PUT IT IN PRACTICE BY MAKING TELESCOPES OF5065 OF DIVERS SIZES AS ALSO MICROSCOPESIN IMITATION OF THOSE OF DI VINI AND CAMPANI AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT HE LATELY SHEWD ONE OF HIS MICROSCOPES TO THE G DUKE WHICH WAS JUDGED BY ALL MUCH BETTER THAN ANY OF THE BEST HIS HIGHNESS HATH AND I WAS AN EYEWITNESS TO THIS THAT FOR MAGNIFYING DEFINING AND CLEARNESS IT WAS FOUND VERY EXCELLENT THE SAME DAY HE LIKE WISE SHEWD HIS HIGHNESS A LITTLE PROSPECTIVE GLASS MADE AC CORDING TO MR NEWTONS NEW INVENTION AND THOUGH THIS WAS BUT THE FIRSTAND WAS NOT ABOVE HALF A FOOT LONG IT HAD THE SAME EFFECT OF ONE OF TWO HE IS NOW MAKING ANOTHER AFTER THE CON CEIT OF M CASSEGRAIN THOUGH HE AGREES NOT WITH HIM IN MAKING CONVEX THE LITTLE SPECULUM WHICH ONE LOOKS INTO THROUGH THE EYE GLASS BUT BELIEVES THE FRENCH AUTHOR ONLY DEVISED THAT TO DISGUISE AS MUCH AS WAS POSSIBLE HIS PRETENDED NEW IN VENTION WHICH HE ENDEAVORS TO MAKE ANTERIOR TO MR NEWTONS MOST NOBLE ONE FOR THE REST HE THINKS HE HATH FOUND A WAY OF MAKING OBJECTS SEEM RIGHT WITH ONE ONLY GLASS BUT TO RETURN FROM THIS DIGRESSION TO OUR FIRST DISCOURSEYOU MAY TAKE NOTICE THAT THE ASSEMBLY AT SIGNOR MAGALOTTIS HA VING BEEN FIRST INFORMD BY DR FRANCINI OF THE GROUNDS OF THIS DISPUTE AND OF THE FORMER OBSERVATIONSHE BEGAN THE SAME EX PERIMENTS BY CAUSING 2 PIGEONS TO BE BIT BY A VIPERS HEAD THAT HAD BEEN DEAD ABOVE TEN HOURS IN SUCH A MANNER THAT BY PRESSING THE GUMS SOME OF THAT YELLOW LIQUOR MIGHT DROP INTO THE WOUND THEY BOTH DIED ONE IN 6 MINUTES AND THE OTHER IN 8 AND NOT BEING CONTENT WITH THIS WITH ANOTHER VIPERS HEAD THEY POISOND A CHICKENWHICH DIED IN 10 MINUTES THERE APPEARD AFTERWARDS ANOTHER PIGEON THAT HAD BEEN WOUNDED MANY HOURS BEFORE BY A DEAD VIPERS HEAD BUT IT HAD BEEN DEAD SO LONG THAT THE LIQUOR QUITE DRIED UP IN THE GUMS WAS BECOME SO HARD THAT FOR ALL THE SQUEESING OF IT NOTHING WOULD COME TO THE TEETH WHENCE THIS PIGEON WAS VERY WELL AND DR FRANCINI HAVING CAUSED THE SAME BIRD TO BE BIT AGAIN BY THE SAME DRIED HEAD IT HAD AFTER A LITTLE FLUTTERING WITH HIS WINGS WHILST THE PAIN OF THE BITING LASTED NO OTHER HARM A LIVE VIPER THEN BEING TAKEN4 CHICKENS WERE BIT BY IT ONE AFTER ANOTHER THE TWO FIRST EITHER BECAUSE THE LIQUOR DID NOT PENETRATE INTO THE WOUND OR THE BLOOD EXPELLED IT AP PEARD NOT TO HAVE ANY DISTEMPER THE 4TH LOOKD AS IF IT WOULD DYE PRESENTLY BUT A LITTLE AFTER COMING TO HIMSELF HE GOT CLEAR OFF5066 OFF FOR THAT TIME BUT THE THIRD WHO SEEMD AT FIRST TO BE VERY LIVELY DYED WITHIN AN HOUR AND AN HALF THERE BEING AFTERWARDS A YOUNG BITCH BROUGHT IN OF A PRETTY SIZE SHE WAS BIT TWICE BY A LIVE VIPER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HANGING PART OF THE EAR WHEREUPON SHE VERY SOON BEGAN TO GIVE MORTAL SIGNS BY STAGGERING VOMITING AND BEING CONVULSED AFTER WHICH HAVING A LITTLE RECOVERD HER SELF THE SAME ACCIDENTS RETURND UPON HERBY WHICH SHE WAS REDUCED TO SUCH A GRIEVOUS CONDITION THAT FOUR HOURS AFTER HER BEING BIT SHE COULD NOT STIR ANY MORE AND SEEMD JUST AS IF SHE HAD BEEN DEAD HOLDING OUT HER TONGUE AND LOOKING VERY GASHLY WITH OUT ANY OTHER SIGN OF LIFE THAN THAT OF PAINFUL BREATHING TO WHICH SHE ADDED SOMETIMES A FAINT BARKING AND A LANGUISHING HOWLING IN WHICH CONDITION SHE WAS STILL FOUND NEXT MORNINGONLY HER RESPIRATI ON WAS YET WEAKER AND SHE APPEARING JUST A DRAWING TO HER END IT WAS OBSERVD THAT NO PART OF HER BODY WAS SWELLD NOR HAD ANY SPOT UPON IT SHE HAD VOIDED BACKWARD SOME MATTER OF A VERY BLACK CO LOUR OF WHICH HER HIND PARTS BEING VERY FOUL A SWARM OF GNATS AND WASPES WERE DEVOURING HER ALIVE WHICH MOVD ONE OF THE SERVANTS OF THE HOUSE TO KNOCK HER IN THE HEAD AFTER THIS THERE WERE BIT TWO CAPONS AND A PULLET BY A FRESH VI PERVEXED A PURPOSE AND BECAUSE THEY GAVE NOT THEN ANY SIGNS OF BEING ILL THEY WERE SENT BACK TO THEIR COOPS AND THERE HAVING CON TINUED WELL TILL EVENING THEY WERE SURPRISD AT NIGHT BY A DISTEMPER WHICH IN ALL LIKELYHOOD PROCEEDED FROM THE POISON FOR NEXT MORNING ONE OF THE CAPONS AND THE PULLET WERE FOUND DEAD I MUST NOT FORGET TO TELL YOUTHAT THE LAST THING THAT WAS DONEWAS THE SENDING TO THE PIGEONHOUSE FOR THAT PIGEONTHAT HAD IN HIS BREAST THE STALK THAT HAD NOT BEEN IMBUED BY THE YELLOW LIQUOR WHERE HE HAD BEEN KEPT DURING ALL THAT INTERVAL OF TIME FROM THE FIRST EXPERIMENTS TO THESE LAST BEING NOW FOUND BY ALL NOT ONLY VERY LIVELY BUT ALSO IN A THRIVING CONDITION THE PLACE OF HIS WOUND BEING SEARCHT THE STALK WAS EASILY FELT AND WAS BEFORE THE EYES OF ALL THE COMPANYWITH A LITTLE PAIR OF PINCHERS DRAWN OUT THIS IS SIR WHAT I CAN CONSIDENTLY AFFIRM TO HAVE BEEN AN EYEWIT NESS OF AND IT BEING NOT MY BUSINESS TO MAKE REFLECTIONS UPON THESE EXPERIMENTS I LEAVE THAT TO YOU I KNOW I HAVE NOT SAID ANY THING BUT WHAT WILL BE MOST AMPLY FOUND IN SIGN REDIS FIRST AND 2D BOOK BUT THAT WHICH URGED ME TO MAKE THIS REPETITION WAS THE THOUGHTS THAT IT MIGHT BE ACCEPTABLE TO YOU TO SEE HIS ASSERTIONS CONFIRMED BY THE TESTIMONIES OF SO MANY PERSONSTHAT ARE THE MORE ABLE TO BE JUD GES OF THEM BECAUSE THEIR UNDERSTANDINGS ARE SUCH THAT TIS NOT POS SIBLE TO IMPOSE UPON THEM IF I MAY BE SO HAPPY AS TO RECEIVE SOMETIMES FROM YOU AN ACCOUNT OF THE CURIOUS PERFORMANCES OF YOUR FAMOUS ROYAL SOCIETY I SHALL MAKE USE OF THAT FAVOUR TO ANIMATE THE VIRTUOSI HERE TO DO SOMETHING THAT MAY NOT BE UNWORTHY OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE BUT BEFORE YOU AFFORD ME THIS HONOR I MUST FIRST BESEECH YOU TO LAY YOUR COMMANDS ON ME BY THE EXECUTION OF WHICH YOU SHALL PLAINLY SEE WITH HOW MUCH RE ALITY I AM C DR JOHN

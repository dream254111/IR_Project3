Electrified Bodies in Their Relations to Conducting Powers and Temperature,i206976,C 425 3 XXIX Farther researches on the magnetic phenomena produced by electricity with some new experiments on the properties of electrified bodies in their relations to conducting powers and temperature By Sir HUMPHRY DAVY Bart P R S Read July 5 1821 I IN my letter to Dr WOLLASTON on the new facts dis covered by M OERSTED which the Society has done me the honour to publish I mentioned that I was not able to render a bar of steel magnetic by transmitting the electrical dis charge across it through a tube filled with sulphuric acid and I have likewise mentioned that the electrical discharge passed across a piece of steel through air rendered it less magnetic than when passed through a metallic wire and I attributed the first circumstance to the sulphuric acid being too bad a conductor to transmit a sufficient quantity of electricity for the effect and the second to tlhe electricity passing through air in a more diffused state than through metals To gain some distinct knowledge on the relations of the different conductors to the magnetism produced by electricity I instituted a series of eXperiments which led to very decisive results and confirmed my first views II I found that the magnetic phaenomena were precisely the same whether the electricity was small in quantity and passing through good conductors of considerable magnitude or whether the conductors were so imperfect as to convey only426 Sir HUMPHRY DAVY on the magnetic phenomena a small quantity of electricity and in both cases they were neither attractive of each other nor of iron filings and not affected by the magnet and the only proof of their being magnetic was their occasioning a certain small deviation of the magnetized needle Thus a large piece of charcoal placed in the circuit of a very powerful battery being a very bad conductor compared with the metals would not affect the compass needle at all unless it had a very large contact with the metallic part of the circuit and if a small wire was made to touch it in the circuit only in a few points that wire did not gain the power of attracting iron filings  though when it was made to touch a surface of platinum foil coiled round the end of the charcoal a slight effect of this kind was produced And in a similar manner fused hydrate of potassa one of the best of the im perfect conductors could never be made to exert any attrac tive force on iron filings nor could the smallest filaments of cotton moistened by solution of hydrate of potassa placed in the circuit be made to move by the magnet nor did steel needles floating on cork on an electrized solution of this kind placed in the voltaic circuit gain any polarity and the only proof of the magnetic powers of electricity passing through such a fluid was afforded by its effect upon the magnetized needle when the metallic surfaces plunged in the fluid were of considerable extent That the mobility of the parts of fluids did not interfere with their magnetic powers as de veloped by electricity I proved by electrifying mercury and NEWTONS metal fused in small tubes These tubes placed in a proper voltaic circuit attracted iron filings and gave magnetic powers to needles nor did any agitation of theproduced by electricity mercury or metal within either in consequence of nechanical motion or heat alter or suspend their polarity III Imperfect conducting fluids do not give polarity to steel when electricity is passed through them but electricity passed through air produces this effect Reasoning on this pheno menon and on the extreme mobility of the particles of air I concluded as M ARAGO had likewise done from other con siderations that the voltaic current in air would he affected by the magnet I failed in my first trial which I have re ferred to in a note to my former paper and in other trials made since by using too weak a magnet but I have lately had complete success and the experiment exhibits a very striking phzenomenon Mr PEPYS having had the goodness to charge the great battery of the London Institution consisting of two thousand double plates of zinc and copper with a mixture of 1168 parts of water 108 parts of nitrous acid and 25 parts of sulphuric acid the poles were connected by charcoal so as to make an arc or column of electrical light varying in length from one to four inches according to the state of rarefaction of the atmosphere in which it was produced and a powerful magnet being presented to this arc or column having its pole at a very acute angle to it the arc or column was attracted or repelled with a rotatory motion or made to revolve by placing the poles in different positions according to the same law as the electrified cylinders of platinum described in my last paper being repelled when the negative pole was on the right hand by the north pole of the magnet and attracted by the south pole and vice versa It was proved by several experiments that the motion de MDCCCXXI 3 I 427428 Sir HUMPHRY DAVY on the magnetic phenomena pended entirely upon the magnetism and not upon the elec trical inductive power of the magnet for masses of soft iron or of other metals produced no effect The electrical arc or column of flame was more easily af fected by the magnet and its motion was more rapid when it passed through dense than through rarified air and in this case the conducting medium or chain of aeriform particles was much shorter I tried to gain similar results with currents of common electricity sent through flame and in vacuo They were al ways affected by the mlagnet but it was not possible to obtain so decided a result as with voltaic electricity because the magnet itself became electrical by induction and that whether it was insulated or connected with the ground IV Metals it is well known readily transmit large quanti ties of electricity and the obvious limit to the quantity which they are capable of transmitting seems to be their fusibility or volatilization by the heat which electricity produces in its passage through bodies Now I had found in several experiments that the intensity of this heat was connected with the nature of the medium by which the body was surrounded thus a wire of platinum which was readily fused by transmitting the charge from a vol taic battery in the exhausted receiver of an air pump acquired in air a much lower degree of temperature Reasoning on  I made several experiments on the effects of currents of electricity simultaneously passing through air in different states of rarefaction in the same and different direc tions both from the voltaic and common electrical batteries but I could not es tablish the fact of their magnetic attractions or repulsions with regard to each other which probably was owing to the impossibility of bringing them sufficiently nearproduced by electricity this circumstance it occurred to me that by placing wires in a medium much denser than air such as ether alcohol oils or water I might enable them to transmit a much higher charge of electricity than they could convey without being destroyed in air and thus not only gain some new results as to the magnetic states of such wires but likewise perhaps determine the actual limits to the powers of different bodies to conduct electricity and the relations of these powers A wire of platinum of 2 0 of three inches in length was fused in air by being made to transmit the electricity of two batteries of ten zinc plates of four inches with double copper strongly charged a similar wire was placed in sulphuric ether and the charge transmitted through it It became sur rounded by globules of gas  but no other change took place and in this situation it bore the discharge from twelve batteries of the same kind exhibiting the same phbenomena When only about an inch of it was heated by this high power in ether it made the ether boil and became white hot under the globules of vapour and then rapidly decomposed the ether but it did not fuse When oil or water was substituted for the ether the length of the wire remaining the same it was par tially covered with small globules of gas but did not become red hot On trying the magnetic powers of this wire in water they were found to be very great and the quantity of iron filings that it attracted was such as to form a cylinder round it of nearly the tenth of an inch in diameter To ascertain whether short lengths of fine wire prevented from fusing by being kept cool transmitted the whole elec tricity of powerful voltaic batteries I made a second indepen 429430 Sir HUMPHRY DAVY on the magnetic phvnomena dent circuit from the ends of the battery with silver wires in water so that the chemical decomposition of the water indi cated a residuum of electricity in the battery Operating in this way I found that an inch of wire of platinum of 2 kept cool by water left a great residual charge of electricity in a combination of twelve batteries of the same kind as those above mentioned and after making several trials I found that it was barely adequate to discharge six batteries V Having determined that there was a limit to the quantity of electricity which wires were capable of transmitting it be came easy to institute experiments on the different conducting powers of different metallic substances and on the relation of this power to the temperature mass surface or length of the conducting body and to the conditions of electromagnetic action These experiments were made as nearly as possible under the same circumstances the same connecting copper wires being used in all cases their diameter being more than one tenth of an inch and the contact being always preserved per fect and parts of the same solutions of acid and water were employed in the different batteries and the same silver wires and broken circuit with water were employed in the different trials and when no globules of gas were observed upon the negative silver wire of the second circuit it was concluded that the metallic conducting chain or the primary circuit was adequate to the discharge of the combination To describe more minutely all the precautions observed would be tedious to those persons who are accustomed to experiments with the voltaic apparatus and unintelligible to others  and after allproduced by electricity 4 31 in researches of this nature it is impossible to gain more than approximations to true results for the gas disengaged upon the plates the different distances of the connecting plates and the slight difference of time in making the connections all interfere with their perfect accuracy The most remarkable general result that I obtained by these researches and which I shall mention first as it influ ences all the others was that the conducting power of metallic bodies varied with the temperature and was lower in some inverse ratio as the temperature was higher Thus a wire of platinum of z and three inches in length when kept cool by oil discharged the electricity of two bat teries or of twenty double plates but when suffered to be heated by exposure in the air it barely discharged one battery Whether the heat was occasioned by the electricity or ap plied to it from some other source the effect was the same Thus a wire of platinum of such length and diameter as to discharge a combination without being considerably heated when the flame of a spirit lamp was applied to it so as to make a part of it red hot lost its power of discharging the whole electricity of the battery as was shown by the disengagement of abundance of gas in the secondary circuit which disen gagement ceased as soon as the source of heat was with drawn There are several modes of exhibiting this fact so as to produce effects which till they are witnessed must almost appear impossible Thus let a fine wire of platinum of four or five inches in length be placed in a voltaic circuit so that the electricity passing through it may heat the whole of it to435 Sir HUMPHRY DAVY on the magnetic phaenomena redness and let the flame of a spirit lamp be applied to any part of it so as to heat that part to whiteness the rest of the wire will instantly become cooled below the point of visible ignition For the converse of the experiment let a piece of ice or a stream of cold air be applied to a part of the wire  the other parts will immediately become much hotter and from a red will rise to a white heat The quantity of electricity that can pass through that part of the wire submitted to the chan ges of temperature is so much smaller when it is hot than when it is cold that the absolute temperature of the whole wire is diminished by heating a part of it and vice versa increased by cooling a part of it In comparing the conducting powers of different metals I found much greater differences than I had expected Thus six inches of silver wire of 22 discharged the whole of the electricity of sixtyfive pair of plates of zinc and double cop per made active by a mixture of about one part of nitric acid of commerce and fifteen parts of water Six inches of copper wire of the same diameter discharged the electricity of fifty six pairs of the same combination six inches of tin of the same diameter carried off that of twelve only the same quan tity of wire of platinum that of eleven and of iron that of nine Six inches of wire of lead of 1o seemed equal in their conducting powers to te same length of copper wire of y All the wires were kept as cool as possible by immersion in a basin of water I made a number of experiments of the same kind but the results were never precisely alike though they sometimes  Water is so bad a conductor that in experiments of this kind its effects may be neglected altogether and these effects were equal in all the experimentsproduced by electricity 433 approached very near each other When the batteries were highly charged so that the intensity of the electricity was higher the differences were less between the best and worst conductors and they were greater when the charge was ex tremely feeble Thus with a fresh charge of about i part of nitric acid and 9 parts of water wires of f silver and pla tinum 5 inches long discharged respectively the electricity of 3o and 7 double plates Finding that when different portions of the same wire plunged in a nonconducting fluid were connected with diffe rent parts of the same battery equally charged their conduct ing powers appeared in the inverse ratio of their lengths so when 6 inches of wire of platinum of j3 discharged the electricity of so double plates 3 inches discharged that of o2 J1 inch that of 4o and 1 inch that of 60 it occurred to me that the conducting powers of the different metals might be more easily compared in this way as it would be possible to make the contacts in less time than when the batteries were changed and consequently with less variation in the charge Operating in this way I ascertained that in discharging the electricity of 60 pairs of plates i inch of platinum was equal to about 6 inches of silver to 53 inches of copper to 4 of gold to 38 of lead to about 0 of palladium and J of iron all the metals being in a cooling fluid medium I found as might have been expected that the conducting power of a wire for electricity in batteries of the size and num ber of plates just described was nearly directly as the mass thus when a certain length of wire of platinum discharged i battery the same length of wire of six times the weight dis charged 6 batteries and the effect was exactly the same pro  A foot of this wire weighed i13 grains a foot of the other 67 grains434 Sir HUMPHRY DAVY on the magnetic phenomena vided the wires were kept cool whether the mass was a single wire or composed of 6 of the smaller wires in contact with each other This result alone showed that surface had no re lation to conducting power at least for electricity of this kind and it was more distinctly proved by a direct experiment equal lengths and equal weights of wire of platinum one round and one flattened by being passed transversely through rollers so as to have six or seven times the surface were compared as to conducting powers the flattened wire was the best conductor in air from its greater cooling powers but in water no difference could be perceived between them VI I tried to make a comparison between the conducting powers of fluid menstrua and charcoal and those of metals Six inches of platinum foil an inch and  broad were placed in a vessel which could be filled with any saline solution and a similar piece of platinum placed opposite at an inch distance the whole was then made part of a voltaic circuit which had likewise another termination by silver wires in water and solution of salts added till gas ceased to be liberated from the negative silver wire In several trials of this kind it was found that the whole of the surface of six inches even with the strongest solutions of common salt was insufficient to carry off the electricity even of two pair of plates and a strong solution of potassa carried off the electricity of three pair of plates only whereas an inch of wire of platinum of 2 as has been stated carried off all the electricity of 60 pair of plates The gas liberated upon the surface of the metals when they are placed in fluids renders it impossible to gain accurate results but the con ducting power of the best fluid conductors it seems probableproduced by electricity from these experiments must be some hundreds of thousand times less than those of the worst metallic conductors A piece of wellburnt compact boxwood charcoal was placed in the circuit being  of an inch wide by 1 thick and connected with large surfaces of platinum It was found that 1 inch and 2 carried off the same quantity of elec tricity as 6 inches of wire of platinum of 2j VII I made some experiments with the hope of ascertaining the exact change of ratio of the conducting powers dependent upon tle change of the intensity and quantity of electricity but I did not succeed in gaining any other than the general result that the higher the intensity of the electricity the less difficulty it had in passing through bad conductors and several remarkable phaenomena depend upon this circum stance Thus in a battery where the quantity of the electricity is very great and the intensity very low such as one composed of plates of zinc and copper so arranged as to act only as single plates of from 20 to go feet of surface each and charged by a weak mixture of acid and water Charcoal made to touch only in a few points is almost as much an in sulating body as water and cannot be ignited nor can wires of platinum be heated when their diameter is less than 8g of an inch and their length three or four feet and a foot of platinum wire of i is scarcely heated by such a battery whilst the same length of silver wire of the same diameter is made red hot and the same lengths of thicker wires of platinum or iron are intensely heated The heat produced where electricity of considerable inten MDCCCXXI 3 K 435436 Sir HtMPHRY DAVY on the magnetic phenomena sity is passed through conductors must always interfere with the exact knowledge of the changes of their conducting powers as is proved by the following experiment A bat tery of so pair of plates of zinc and copper plates o1 inches by 6 was very highly charged with a mixture of nitric acid and water so as to exhibit a considerable intensity of elec trical action and the relative conducting powers of silver and platinum in air and water ascertained by means of it In air 6 inches of wire of platinum of f discharged only 4 double plates whilst 6 inches of silver wire of the same diameter discharged the whole combination the platinum was strongly ignited in this experiment whilst the silver was scarcely warm to the touch On cooling the platinum wire by plac ing it in water it was found to discharge o1 double plates When the intensity of the electricity is very high however even the cooling powers of fluid media are of little avail thus I found that fine wire of platinum was fused by the discharge of a common electrical battery under water so that the conducting power must always be diminished by the heat generated in a greater proportion as the intensity of the elec tricity is higher It might at first view be supposed that when a conductor placed in the circuit left a residuum of electricity in any bat tery increase of the power of the battery or of its surface would not enable it to carry through any additional quantity This however is far from being the case When saline solutions were placed in the circuit of a bat tery of eo plates though they discharged a very small quan tity only of the electricity when the troughs were only 4 full yet their chemical decomposition exhibited the fact of a muchproduced by electricity larger quantity passing through them when the cells were filled with fluid And a similar circumstance occurred with respect to a wire of platinum of such a length as to leave a considerable resi duum in a battery when only half its surface was used yet when the whole surface was employed it became much hotter and nevertheless left a still more considerable resi duum VIII I found long ago that in increasing the number of alternations of similar plates the quantity of electricity seemed to increase as the number at least as far as it could be judged of by the effects of heat upon wires but only within certain limits beyond which the number appeared to diminish rather than increase the quantity Thus the two thousand double plates of the London Institution when arranged as one bat tery would not ignite so much wire as a single battery of ten plates with double copper It is not easy to explain this result Does the intensity mark the rapidity of the motion of the electricity  or merely its diminished attraction for the matter on which it acts and does this attraction become less in proportion as the cir cuit through which it passes or in which it is generated con tains a greater number of alternations of bad conductors  Mr CHILDREN in his account of the experiments made with his battery of large plates has ingeniously referred the heat produced by the passage of electricity through conduc tors to the resistance it meets with and has supposed what proves to be the fact that the heat is in some inverse ratio to the conducting power The greatest heat however is pro 437438 Sir HUMPHRY DAVY on the magnetic phenomena duced in air where there is reason to suppose the least resis tance and as the presence of heat renders bodies worse con ductors another view may be taken namely that the exci tation of heat occasions the imperfection of the conducting power But till the causes of heat and of electricity are known and of that peculiar constitution of matter which excites the one and transmits or propagates the other our reasoning on this subject must be inconclusive I found that when equal portions of wires of the same di amneter but of different metals were connected together in the circuit of a powerful voltaic battery acting as two sur faces the metals were heated in the following order iron most then palladium then platinum then tin then zinc then gold then lead then copper and silver least of all And from one experiment in which similar wires of platinum and silver joined in the same circuit were placed in equal portions of oil it appeared that the generation of heat was nearly inversely as their conducting power Thus the silver raised the temperature of the oil only four degrees whilst the pla tinum raised it twentytwo The same relations to heat seem to exist whatever is the intensity of the electricity thus cir cuits of wires placed under water and acted on by the com mon electrical discharge were heated in the same order as by the voltaic battery as was shown by their relative fusion thus iron fusing before platinum platinum before gold and so on If a chain be made of wire of platinum and silver in alter nate links soldered together the silver wire being four or rive times the diameter of the platinum and placed in a power ful voltaic circuit the silver links are not sensibly heatedproduced by electricity 43 whilst all those of the platinum become intensely and equally ignited This is an important experiment for investigating the nature of heat If heat be supposed a substance it cannot be imagined to be expelled from the platinum because an unlimited quantity may be generated from the same platinum i e as long as the electricity is excited or as often as it is renewed Or if it be supposed to be identical with or an element of electricity it ought to bear some relation to its quantity and might be expected to be the same in every part of the chain or greatest in those parts nearest the battery IX The magnetism produced by electricity though with the same conductors it increases with the heat as I mentioned in my last paper yet with different conductors I find it fol lows a very different law Thus when a chain is made of different conducting wires and they are placed in the same circuit they all exhibit equal magnetic powers and take up equal quantities of iron filings So that the magnetism seems directly as the quantity of electricity which they transmit And when in a highly powerful voltaic battery wires of the same diameters and lengths but of which the best conducting is incapable of wholly discharging the bat tery are made separately and successively to form the cir cuit they take up different quantities of iron filings in some direct proportion to their conducting powers Thus in one experiment two inches of wire of  of an inch being used silver took up 32 grains copper 24 plati num 1  and iron 8x

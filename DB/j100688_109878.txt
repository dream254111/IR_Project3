J100688,ABSTRACTS OF THE PAPERS PRINTED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,109878,DESCRIPTION OF A THERMOMETRICAL BAROMETER FOR MEASURING ALTITUDES ABSTRACT,I207044,68 DESCRIPTION OF A THERMOMETRICAL BAROMETER FOR MEASURING ALTITUDES BY THE REV FRANCIS JOHN HYDE WOLLASTON BD FRS READ MARCH 6 1817 PHIL TRANS 1817 P 183 THE AUTHORS ATTENTION HAVING BEEN DRAWN TO THE VARIATIONS IN THE HEAT OF BOILING WATER AS CORRESPONDING WITH CHANGES IN ATMOSPHERICAL PRESSURE AND IN THE HEIGHT OF THE BAROMETER HE WAS LED TO CONSTRUCT THE INSTRUMENT DESCRIBED IN THE PRESENT PAPER FOR THE PURPOSE OF MEASURING HEIGHTS WITH GREATER ACCURACY AND CONVENIENCE THAN BY THE COMMON BAROMETER OR BY THE METHODS FORMERLY DEVISED BY FAHREN HEIT AND CAVALLO THE AUTHOR CONSTRUCTED HIS THERMOMETER WITH DIFFERENT SCALES FROM AN UNCERTAINTY HOW FAR THEIR SENSIBILITY MIGHT BE CARRIED AND IN ONE INSTANCE THE BORE OF THE TUBE WAS SO MINUTE AND THE BALL SO LARGE THAT EVERY DEGREE ON FAHRENHEITS SCALE WAS EQUAL TO TEN INCHES LHE INSTRUMENT HOWEVER WITH WHICH THE GREATEST NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE HAD A SCALE OF 3 98 INCHES TO EVERY DEGREE AND EACH DE GREE IS DIVIDED INTO 100 PARTS UPON THE SCALE AND INTO 1000 BY A VERNIER ON COMPARING THIS THERMOMETER WITH A GOOD BAROMETER IT WAS FOUND THAT THE TWO INSTRUMENTS AGREED EQUALLY WELL IN ALL PARTS BETWEEN 3068 INCHES AND 2823 INCHES THE RESULT WAS THAT A DIF FERENCE OF 10 OF FAHRENHEITS SCALE IS OCCASIONED BY 0589 INCH ON THE BAROMETER 30603 INCHES CORRECTED ON THE BAROMETER 213367 ON THE THERMOMETER AND 28191 INCHES BAROMETER 2090263 THER MOMETER HAVING THUS ASCERTAINED THE DELICACY AND CAPABILITY OF THE INSTRU MENT THE AUTHOR PROCEEDS TO DESCRIBE THE BEST MODE OF CONSTRUCTING IT WHICH IS FURTHER ILLUSTRATED BY AN ANNEXED DRAWING TO THE VER NIER IS ATTACHED A SMALL LENS OF AN INCH FOCUS WHICH ON ACCOUNT OF THE SMALLNESS OF THE BORE OF THE TUBE IS USEFUL IN OBSERVING THE HEIGHT OF THE MERCURIAL THREAD AND BY HAVING NO LATERAL MOTION CONFINES THE VIEW TO THE SAME DIRECTION THUS PREVENTING PARALLAX THE BOILER OF THIS INSTRUMENT IS A TIN CYLINDER 55 INCHES DEEP AND 12 INCHES IN DIAMETER WITH AN EXTERNAL CYLINDER 1 4 INCH DIAMETER FOR PREVENTING THE TRANSMISSION OF HEAT THE BOTTOM IS SINGLE AND THE BULB DOES NOT DIP INTO THE WATER BUT IS EXPOSED TO THE STEAM ONLY AND A BELLTENT PROTECTS THE LAMP AND BOILER FROM THE WIND THE LAMP IS FILLED WITH OIL TO WHICH A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF TALLOW IS ADDED TO MAKE IT CONGEAL AT COMMON TEMPERATURES HAVING TRIED THREADS OF VARIOUS THICKNESSES THE AUTHOR ADVISES THE SCALE OF AN INCH TO A DEGREE AS BEST ADAPTED TO ALL ORDINARY PURPOSES FOR WHEN FINER THAN THIS IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE SUCH STRENGTH TO THE BULB AS TO FORCE THE COLUMRN OF MERCURY ACCURATELY TO THE SAME HEIGHT ON REPETITION OF THE BOILING BY REASON OF THE RESISTANCE FROM FRICTION IN THE TUBE WITH AN INCH SCALE THE VARIATIONS OF THE BAROMETRICAL THERMOMETER ARE TO THOSE OF THE COMMON BAROMETER AS 53  AND THE SENSIBILITY OF THE INSTRUMENT IS SUCH THAT THE DIFFERENCE OF TEMPERATURE REQUIRED TO MAKE WATER BOIL ARISING FROM THE HEIGHT OF A COMMON TABLE IS IMME69 DIATELY PERCEPTIBLE AFTER STATING THE METHODS FOR ADJUSTING THIS THERMOMETER FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF THE GREATEST HEIGHTS THE AUTHOR DETAILS SOME EXPERIMENTS UPON ALTITUDES MADE WITH AN INSTRUMENT 552 PARTS UPON THE SCALE OF WHICH WERE EQUAL TO 530 FEET IN ALTITUDE WITH THIS INSTRUMENT BOILED ON THE COUNTER OF A BOOKSELLERS SHOP IN PATERNOSTERROW ESTIMATED BETWEEN FOUR AND FIVE FEET ABOVE THE FOOT PAVEMENT ON THE NORTH SIDE OF ST PAULS CHURCHYARD AND BOILED AGAIN IN THE GILT GALLERY OF THE CATHEDRAL THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE OF 254 PARTS THE CORRECTED HEIGHT THUS INDICATED THEREFORE  272 64 FEET GENERAL ROY MAKES THE GALLERY ABOVE THE NORTH PAVEMENT TO BE 281 FEET WHICH ALLOWING FIVE FEET FOR THE DIFFERENCE OF STATION BRINGS THE AUTHORS ESTIMATE TO 267 FEET DIFFERING ONLY FOUR FEET OR BY ANOTHER CALCULATION FOUNDED ON GENERAL ROYS STATEMENT THE DIF FERENCE IS LESS THAN TWO FEET OBSERVATIONS ON THE ANALOGY WHICH SUBSISTS BETWEEN THE CALCULUS OF FUNCTIONS AND OTHER BRANCHES OF ANALYSIS BY CHARLES BABBAGE ESQ MA FRS READ APRIL 17 1817 PHIL TRANS 1817 P 197 AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THIS PAPER THE AUTHOR STATES THE ADVAN TAGES WHICH MAY BE DERIVED FROM THE EMNPLOYMENT OF ANALOGICAL REA SONING IN MATHEMATICS AND RECOMMENDS IT AS A VERY USEFUL GUIDE TO NEW DISCOVERIES HE THEN PROCEEDS TO POINT OUT THE STRIKING RESEM BLANCE WHICH SUBSISTS BETWEEN SEVERAL PARTS OF COMMON ALGEBRA AND THE INTEGRAL CALCULUS AND SIMILAR PARTS OF THE CALCULUS OF FUNCTIONS MR BABBAGE THEN NOTICES CERTAIN FRACTIONS WHICH BY PECULIAR RE LATIONS AMONG THE FUNCTIONS OF WHICH THEY CONSIST BECOME EVANESCENT THE TRUE VALUES OF THESE FRACTIONS ARE ASCERTAINED AND THEY ARE AP PLIED TO THE SOLUTION OF A CLASS OF FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS WHICH THE AUTHOR HAD SOLVED IN A FORMER PAPER FROM WHICH THE FOLLOWING RESULT IS OBTAINED WHENEVER THE MODE OF SOLUTION THERE ADOPTED SEEMS TO FAIL THE FAILURE IS APPARENT ONLY AND THE GENERAL SOLUTION MAY AL WAYS BE DEDUCED FROM IT SEVERAL POINTS OF RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN THE INTEGRAL CALCULUS AND THAT OF FUNCTIONS ARE THEN NOTICED AND A REMARKABLE ANALOGY BE TWEEN A METHOD OF INTEGRATING DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS AND A MODE OF SOLVING FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS IS POINTED OUT IN BOTH CASES THE OPE RATIONS ARE PERFORMED BY MULTIPLYING BY A FACTOR WHOSE FORM IS TO BE DETERMINED BY ANOTHER EQUATION SOME EQUATIONS ARE GIVEN IN WHICH THIS METHOD IS SUCCESSFUL AND THE OBSTACLES TO ITS GENERAL AP PLICATION ARE POINTED OUT AS DEMANDING FURTHER INQUIRY OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF LOGARITHMIC TABLES BY THOMAS KNIGHT ESQ COMMUNICATED BY TAYLOR COMBE ESQ SEC RS READ FEBRUARY 27 1817 PHIL

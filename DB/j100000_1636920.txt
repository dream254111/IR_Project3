asking for recognition and support by botan ists The first in point of time is the American Fern Journal the first number of which ap peared about the middle of last August It is now announced to be the official organ of the American Fern Society and its place of publication is Port Richmond N Y It is to be devoted to the general study of ferns and is to appear quarterly The field of the new journal appears to be distinctly system atic in the old sense and would seem to be in tended to serve oldtime collectors of ferns and the private makers of fern herbaria While the Fern Journal does not cover exactly the field already occupied by the Fern Bul letin published by W N Clute the latter being much less technical it must be con fessed that they are rather too nearly alike and one is led to wonder whether there is room in this country for two journals devoted to such a small group of plants as the ferns However we may hope that after a period characterized by a Cstruggle for existence there may be a  survival of the fittest In the meantime let us keep up our subscriptions for both periodicals hoping that the best that there is in each may be preserved in the  sur vival which may be a JournalBulletin The other journalPhytopathologyis also an official organ having for this relation the American Phytopathological Society It  is designed primarily as a channel of publi cation for the phytopathological contribu tions of the members of the society The principal editors are Professor L R Jones of the University of Wisconsin Dr C L Shear of the U S Department of Agriculture and Professor H H Whetzel of Cornell Univer sity It is to appear bimonthly and the sub scription price is three dollars It is clearly to be a strictly scientific jour nal of plant pathology having no popular leanings whatever Its field has hitherto been wholly unoccupied and there should be no question as to the support of the journal It should be found on every botanists table and should be accessible to all students of plant pathology A PERIODICAL FOR MOSS STUDENTS A NEW chapter is opened for The Bryol ogist with the January 1911 number it be comes the property of The Sullivant Moss So ciety and its officers recently elected become the advisory board President Dr Alexander W Evans Yale University vicepresident Miss Caroline Coventry Haynes Highlands N J secretary Mr N L T Nelson Des Moines College Des Moines Ia treasurer Mrs Annie Morrill Smith Brooklyn N Y They have appointed Dr A J Grout as editorinchief with associate editors as fol lows Dr George N Best Rosemont N J Dr A W Evans New Haven Conn John M Holzinger Winona Minn and Professor Lincoln W Riddle Wellesley College Welles ley Mass The Sullivant Moss Society has held seven most successful public meetings in affiliation with the American Association for the Ad vancement of Science and plans to hold the eighth in the same connection at Washington D C this coming December It will be noticed that the associate editors represent an eminent authority in the several 586 SCIENCEAPRIL 14 1911 SCIENCE groups treated of in The Bryologist namely Dr Best the pleurocarpous mosses Professor Holzinger the acrocarpous mosses Dr Evans the Hepaticae and Professor Riddle the lichens HOUGHS LEAFKEY TO THE TREES MR ROMEYN B HOUGH has brought out a handy pocket manual which he calls a Leaf Key to the Trees of the Northern States and Canada The booklet is of such dimensions that it can be carried very easily in ones pocket its dimensions being 41 by 6 inches and not over a quarter of an inch in thickness In about thirty pages all of the common native trees from the Rocky Mountains eastward and north of the latitude of North Carolina are briefly characterized by means of keys which refer principally to their leaves With this in hand the tyro ought to find no difficulty in finding the name of any native tree in the region named It should be especially helpful to young foresters SHORT NOTES A YEAR or so ago W N Clute brought out a little  Laboratory Botany Ginn for use in high schools which should have been no ticed long ago It has already commended itself to teachers as a most useful laboratory guide THE crowngall of plants is discussed very fully and conclusively in Bulletin 213 of the Bureau of Plant Industry of the United States Department of Agriculture The au thors Erwin F Smith Nellie A Brown and C 0 Townsend find that Bacterium tume faciens produces tumors upon many species of plants in widely separate parts of the nat ural system Thus peach apple rose quince chestnut grape etc when attacked by this organism develop the growths known by the name of  crown gall Parts III and IV of Oakes Amess  Orchi daceae  continue to maintain the high stand ard set in the first and second parts The books are not only of high scientific value to the botanist but the printing and paper are superb and when added to the wealth of ar tistic etchings constitute volumes that any artist might be glad to own They form a notable addition to the literature of botany CHARLES E BESSEY THE UNIVERSITY OFP NEBRASKA SPECIAL ARTICLES THE POISONOUS EFFECTS OF ALCOHOLIC BEVER AGES NOT PROPORTIONAL TO THEIR ALCOHOLIC CONTENTS SUCH a vast amount of investigation and discussion has been centered on the liquor problem during the last few years that it seems almost presumptuous to attempt to add any new information to the subject or even to emphasize a point which has been previously recognized but not thoroughly appreciated In the report of the investigations made by the subcommittee of the committee of fifty to investigate the liquor problem Abel states  That more concentrated alcoholic liquors or spirits are from a practical point of view the most toxic of all alcoholic beverages If whiskey or cognac were always to be diluted with water until the percentage of alcohol was brought down to ten per cent they would be no more toxic than wine pf the same strength These statements would lead one to infer that if the alcoholic content of all beverages was reduced to the same percentage the toxic ity of each beverage would be the same If true such a conclusion would greatly simplify the method of determining the relative harm fulness of the many kinds of alcoholic bever ages Numerous investigators have subjected various living organisms to the influence of pure ethyl alcohol diluted with water and also to beverages which contained varying amounts of it In general they have obtained definite results showing that alcohol in appreciable quantities is always injurious to living matter It is recognized that some species of living organisms are more resistant to the influence of alcohol than others and also that some in dividuals of the same species are more resist ant than other individuals but if many indi 1 Physiological Aspects of the Liquor Prob lem 1903 A report by the subcommittee of the Committee of Fifty to investigate the liquor problem edited by John

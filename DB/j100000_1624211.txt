Hills and deeplyseated intrusions of a viscous magma which raised vast domes of sedimentary rock with the floor of metamorphic rock on which they rested as the whole Black Hills dome Big Horn and Park mountains As to the cause of these uplifts nothing less than the force exerted by a cooling globe is thought to be adequate That they took place very slowly is inferred from the fact that fracture did not result from the bending of thousands of feet of strata That these domes are in the interior of the continent rather than near the coast is because here the crust is relatively light and strata are hori zontal hence pressure on the plastic interior due to contraction ofcrust or to transfer of ma terial on the surface would be most likely to produce domes Deformation of Rocks By C R VAN HISE This is the first of a series of papers on the same subject to be published in the Journal as Studies for Students The author divides the outer part of the earth into three zones 1 An upper zone of fracture 2 a middle zone of fracture and plasticity 3 a lower zone of plasticity Rocks under less weight than their ultimate strength when rapidly deformed are in the zone of fracture The maximum depth at which fracture can take place is thought to be 10000 meters Rocks below this are in the region of plasticity and flowage Since flowage is necessary to folding closely folded strata were generally buried beneath other strata The boundary between the zone of fracture and that of flowage is at different depths for two rocks of different strength also for the same rock under different conditions of stress hence there is a zone of combined fracture and flowage This is thick and of prime importance In heterogeneous strata in this zone irregular fracturing brecciation jointing faulting fold ing and development of secondary structures may occur together in a most complex manner Between the three zones there are many grada tions Chas R Keyes contributes a careful and

DEMIES GEOLOGICAL CONFERENCE OF HARVARD UNI VERSITY MARCH 10 1896 An elementary presentation of the tides BY W M DAVIS The object of this communication is to show how the tides may be treated in an essentially scientific manner in an elementary collegiate course on physiography The facts are pre sented by means of tracings from selected auto matic records of tide gauges in the Coast Sur vey office for stations in midocean Honolulu Pacific coast Port Townsend Wash Atlantic coast Boston and in estuaries Delaware at Philadelphia and lower Seine the latter from French records Mean interval of tides and systematic variation of interval and of range are numerically determined from these records by the students in laboratory exercises The agreement of the mean interval with half a lunar day suggests that the moon and the tides may be related in some way as cause and effect Inquiry is then made as to the manner in which the moon could cause periodic oscillations of the ocean The dimensions distance and movements of the earth and moon being given the deforming forces due to lunar attraction situated as it were on a shell enclosing the earth are worked out quantitatively in terms of gravity according to the law of gravitation A tide opposite to the direct lunar tide often regarded as an obscure part of the problem is seen to be as essential a consequence of the theory as the direct tide it self The first simple supposition of a moon moving in a circular orbit in the plane of the earths equator is afterwards changed to the actual condition of the moon moving in an orbit of considerable eccentricity and in a plane ob lique to the equator thus introducing expecta tions of various systematic inequalities in tidal intervals and ranges The essential features of diurnal inequality are simply illustrated as a necessary consequence of theory by means of a tidal globe rigged with appropriate circles for high and low tides Solar tidal forces andN S VOL III No 67 their combinations with lunar forces are easily calculated to a sufficient degree of detail Although the forces available for the defor mation of the ocean are so small that the student may at first doubt their sufficiency as a cause of the observed tides his doubts vanish when the consequences of the theory are systematically confronted with the generalized results of obser vation and the extraordinary agreements of the two are discovered Although a fairly com plete record of facts may be made by the aver age college student in the early laboratory exer cises it is nearly always the case that some classes of facts will escape his first scrutiny of the tidal curves and will be revealed only when attention is called to them by the expectations of theory Due attention is thus paid to the different kinds of verification of theory The final acceptance of the theory becomes a logical necessity independent of the will even though certain features of the tides especially of the Atlantic tides remain beyond the reach of the elementary discussion here attempted The treatment of the openocean tide and the onshore tide as comparable to offshore swell and onshore surf suffices to explain various facts as to age and range and the treatment of the onshore tide as a wave accounts for the pecu liar relations often observed between flood and ebb currents and high and low water It is on the basis of work of this kind that the claim is made of the essentially scientific quality of physiography Although other divisions of the subject may not be dealt with mathematically they all contain the logically successive phases of observed and generalized facts postulated general principles provisional hypotheses con sequences or expectations deduced from the hypotheses comparison of the consequences with the facts and final evaluation of the knowl edge gained Lunar gravity is the main force causing the tidal changes of the sea terrestrial gravity is the main force causing the slower physiographic changes of the land Tidal Scour By F P GULLIVER The speaker considered the forms produced by the tides upon flat coasts and pointed out that it is wholly a question of ratios that determines the form in any given locality He did not agree with Mr Shelford that deltas are produced only in tideless seas for there are weak tides even in the Gulf of Mexico where the Mississippi mouths and in the Mediterranean where the Nile and Tiber deltas are found while the Ganges produces its delta in the face of seven teenfoot tides If the river is relatively stronger than the tides and other sea forces it will build forward a delta It is also largely a question of ratios between the on and offshore action and the alongshore action which determines the production of broken or continuous shore lines Where there is a broad area of marshes and flats upon which the water lies at high tide and then during the ebb scours runways beneath the level of the flats it is inferred that the tidal action is the process which determines the shore forms Off steeper coasts less tidal action is indicated Where the shoreline is prevailingly longitudinal a ratio in favor of alongshore action is inferred A graded series of shore forms was shown from that in which the pure tidal on and off shore action is indicated to that in which the alongshore action seems to be dominant The type of the tidal action was on the west coast of Florida where the tides are weak but indi cations of alongshore action are absent there fore the ratio is greatly in favor of the tides The runways are of the indefinite consequent or autogentic type of drainage and the shore line is minutely irregular without deep indenta tions The salt marsh grades into the tidal flat The type of the dominant alongshore action was taken from the Texas coast An offshore bar here forms a long gently swinging curve ex tending for 102 miles unbroken by a single tidal inlet This bar appears to have an outline dominated by alongshore action Along the coasts of the world various com binations of different absolute values of these two actions may be seen in varying ratio Where the values are larger the forms have greater vertical measure as in South Carolina and in the SchleswigHolstein region The fol lowing series of maps was shown illustrating the progressive change in ratios between the  Min Proc Inst

Field Geology 2d edition reissue of 1894 by T A JAGGAR JR This book published by Bailliere Tindall and Cox London and A Geikies  Outlines of Field Geology Macmillan 1891 are the only books known to the writer which purport to deal with practical field methods of geology Geikies book is more popular in style more elementary and more comprehensive his chap ter on the schistose rocks is excellent while Penning does not even mention them Penn ings book on the other hand contains many useful tables rules for finding true dip tracing boundary lines and faults levelling etc The directions for note taking do not include men tion of the co6rdinate method of designating points on the notebook map nor is the use of the planetable mentioned in these and other respects the book is not up to date for the American geologist but on the whole the part which deals with geological surveying sections and levelling contains much that is useful The part devoted to paleontology by JukesBrowne contains many useful hints for the collector and tables of fossils that are of course intended for use in British fields Part V is suggestive dealing with some difficulties likely to be en countered by the student in the field notes on water supply springs and wells stress is laid on the great importance of the study of physi cal features in connection with geological struc 571 ture The weakest chapter in the book is that devoted to lithology which gives elaborate and antiquated tables of physical tests for minerals rocks and ores but does not touch on the diffi culties likely to beset the student in the field Mr Penning believes  it should be unnecessary to insist upon what all geological textbooks so strongly recommends that an acquaintance with the appearance and characteristics of all ordinary rocks and minerals should be formed by careful study of cabinet specimens He believes that tests applied in their proper order according to his tables will go far enough to arrive at an accurate solution Rutleys Study of Rocks 1879 is quoted as an important work recently published while in the lithological bibliography no mention is made of such books as Tealls British Petro graphy or the

first VicePresi dent and there were present 39 persons Two new members were elected and W A Bastedo appointed to act as Secretary during the absence of Dr Rusby in South America As the summer season is now rapidly ap proaching a  Field Committee with Dr N L Britton as chairman was appointed to ar range for the weekly outings of the club The announced paper on Azaleas was post poned owing to the

commended by Dr Britton Also a sedge Reimaria maritima only lately found in Florida at Lake Worth but having a wide distribution elsewhere The announced paper for the meeting was read by Miss Alexandrina Taylor entitled A comparative Study of the superficial Periderm in a number of species of Salix and was well illustrated by diagrams In most textbooks the work of Sanio is taken as authority on the development of superficial periderm From the large number of species of the genus Salix he selected one as a type The many varia tions from this type pointed to the possibility that by extending the study over a greater num ber of species than those studied by Sanio one might be found which might more justly be called the type of the genus This was the object of the above study W A BASTEDO Recording Secretary pro tern WEST VIRGINIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCE THE fifteenth regular meeting of the cademy which was also the first annual session of the organization was held at Morgantown March 24 1896 The following officers were reelected President Dr A D Hopkins VicePresi dent Prof Thos C Miller Secretary and Treasurer Mr W Earl Rumsey Correspond ing Secretary Prof B H Hite The President in referring to the history and first years work of the Academy stated that the Academy was organized on February 25 1895 with sixteen active members and twelve associate members representing chemistry physics geology biology entomology mechani cal and civil engineering zoology medicine agriculture horticulture and general science Fourteen regular sessions of the Academy have been held twentyeight communications have been presented and three important reso lutions have been passed The communications referred to the following subjects and branches of science Chemistry 1 psychology 3 electricity 2 geology 1 horticulture 2 bibliography 2 agriculture 2 entomology 2 mechanical engi neering 3 ornithology 2 general science 1 N S VOL III No 67 anthropology 1 botany 1 civil engineeringy 1 hydrography 2 forestry 2 The resolutions were with reference to the publication of topographic maps waterways and forest preservation The only communication presented at this meeting besides the Presidents remarks was by Prof L C Corbett who announced the comple tion and successful test of an improved auxanom eter which was exhibited at work In ex planation Prof Corbett stated that the chief features of the machine are that all parts of the instrument are mounted upon a rigid base the usual system of proportionate pulleys has been replaced by a simple lever of the first type i e where the fulcrum is between the power and the weight The record is made in ink upon a paperbound cylinder The rate of the cylinder is retarded to a single revolution in 24 hours The record of each day therefore ap pears as a platted curve rather than in the form of a spiral as is the case with recording drums making a revolution each hour The mode of attaching the auxanometer to the plant has been improved upon by substituting wooden forceps with relatively broad faces for the usual bent pin this is again connected with the recording arm of the instrument by a fine wire instead of the usual cord In this way the objectionable features of the system of weighted cords and pulleys are overcome W EARL RUMSEY Secretary NEW BOOKS A Compendium of General Botany MAX WES TERMAIER

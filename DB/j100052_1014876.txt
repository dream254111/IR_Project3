j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1014876,American Rights and Interests in the Mandatory System,i242685,AMERICAN INTERESTS IN THE MANDATORY SYSTEM American Rights and Interests in the Mandatory System By FANNIE FERN ANDREWS Secretary of the American School Citizenship League I AM one of those idealists if you please who caught the spirit of a new era while attending the Peace Conference at Paris I was present at that plenary session of the Peace Con ference on February 14 1919 when President Wilson read that first Cove nant of the League of Nations and when he read Article XIX for it was Article XIX of the February 14th Covenant which initiated the mandatory system every person in that vast hall in the French Foreign Office felt that a new plan for the treatment of the backward peoples of the world was really coming to pass That idea which was inspired at Paris is a real thing and it can never die I am an idealist when I perceive the ideal to be real I was also greatly encouraged by the Convention signed at SaintGermain enLaye September 10 1919 revising the General Act of Berlin of 1885 and the General Act and Declaration of Brussels of 1890 This Treaty practi cally extends the essential principles of the mandates under the League of Nations to those regions included in the General Act of Berlin and the General Act of Brussels The United States was a party to that Treaty but as we know it has not yet been ratified It was a step however in the right direction and that step was prompted by Article XXII of the Covenant of the League of Nations which provides for the Mandate System EDUCATIONAL INTEREST OF THE UNI TED STATES IN THE NEAR EAST As to the situation in the Near East we might very well say that the United States holds the educational mandate for that territory Colleges organized and maintained by American citizens with some twenty other chartered cor porations have exerted an influence not only in the direction of moral and intellectual betterment but also have done more to promote harmony and friendly cooperation among the differ ent races than any other or all other agencies The fundamental principle of the Mandate System is well illus trated by these American enterprises which have as their only object the welfare of the inhabitants of the coun try There is no oil question here There was presented to the Supreme Council in London meeting for the purpose of modifying the Sevres Treaty an important and in some respects a striking document It was presented by Dr James L Barton Secretary of the American Commissioners of For eign Missions This document is en titled Memorandum addressed to the Premiers assembled in conference in London on behalf of the American Missionary Educational and Philan thropic Bodies carrying on work in the Ottoman Empire in regard to Amer ican rights and interests under the Turkish Capitulations It reads WHEREAS considerable portions of the Ottoman Empire are passing from Turkish control and WHEREAS capitulatory rights and priv ileges have prevailed in these areas for generations under which extensive invest ments have been made in the creation and conduct of American establishments of education philanthropy and religion hav ing for their object only the betterment of the country and the preparation of the native youth for more worthy citizenship and 95THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY WHEREAS the appointment of man datories is likely to lead to a modification of the historic capitulations hitherto prevailing in the Ottoman Empire as well as possible modifications in Ottoman territory not passing under mandatory forms THEREFORE the large American con stituency supporting the American educa tional philanthropic and religious estab lishments in the Ottoman Empire hold and maintain that in any changes made in the terms of the capitulations the rights of the above mentioned American establishments in respect to religious liberty the use of the English language freedom from inter ference the acquisition of property and absolute equality of treatment with other educational philanthropic and religious establishments of the countries shall be preserved and continued There are two memoranda attached to this declaration Memorandum A enumerates the various educa tional religious and philanthropic establishments in the old Ottoman Empire and states that more than seventy million dollars have been ex pended for these enterprises and that at the present time some ten million dollars are invested in plants buildings and equipments Memorandum B enumerates Am erican losses occasioned by the war in Turkey and calls attention to Article 235 part VIII of the Sevres Treaty of Peace with Turkey which provides for the repayment of losses sustained by civilian nationals in respect of their persons and property through the ac tion or negligence of the Turkish au thorities during the war and up to the coming into force of the present treaty Memorandum B closes with the following statement It is therefore respectfully requested that the Con ference of Premiers should give full consideration to the losses of American civilians in Turkey as above outlined and provide for adequate reimburse ment LEGAL PROBLEMS INVOLVED IN THE APPEAL TO THE SUPREME COUNCIL This document as I have said be fore is important because it shows the urgent need of settling affairs in the Near East It presents a problem which ought to be solved as soon as possible Almost all of the American colleges have been interrupted in their work on account of the war The document is in some respects a strik ing document A body of American citizens has directly appealed to the Supreme Council upon which at that time the United States had no repre sentative It would have been a more regular procedure if the United States should have made this appeal according to the usual diplomatic channels but supposingand I am raising these questions just to show the intricate problems that will arise under the mandatory system not only in this part of Europe and Asia but also in Africathe United States should nego tiate for the reparation which this docu ment demands To whom shall the United States direct her negotiations Shall it be to the Turkish Government the Ottoman Empire is still techni cally sovereignand if so shall it be to the Kemalist government at Angora or to the government of Constantino ple where as we know the British are already in occupation Or shall the United States in negotiating for these rights in mandated territory wait until the mandatories take legal possession And then shall the United States nego tiate with them or with the League of Nations the final trustee of these terri tories These questions bring up an other question What rights shall the United States have under the old capit ulations What rights shall the Uni ted States have as the result of our Treaty of 1870 with Turkey which pro vides for the holding of property in 96AMERICAN INTERESTS IN THE MANDATORY SYSTEM Turkey by American citizens The subject of treaty rights in mandated territories is a very intricate and a very difficult subject All these questions refer equally to those rights in Meso potamia for which the United States has already made positive demands PROPOSED POLICY FOR THE UNITED STATES Now in view of all this what solu tion may we recommend I should like to offer the suggestion that the United States accept the invitation of the Council of the League of Nations to send a representative to talk over the terms of the draft mandates for Class B covering the former German colonies in Central Africa and those for Class A covering portions of the Ottoman Empire The United States should never have left the Supreme Council She should have helped to negotiate the Sevres Treaty as she did the Bulgarian Treaty She not only had a right to assist in defining these terms of peace but she had an obligation as well Her right as stated by Mr Colby to Earl Curzon November 20 1920 accrued to her as a direct result of the war against the Central Powers The obligation was embodied in her reason for entering the warto dethrone autocracy The whole mandate problem was held up last March by a Note from the United States Government to the Coun cil of the League of Nations Upon receiving the Note the Council imme diately agreed to postpone all consider ation of the question until the next meeting which was set for June 27 The reply which the Council sent to the United States contained an invi tation to this country to send a repre sentative to sit with the Council for the discussion of mandates This invita tion is as follows The Council invites the United States to take part in the discussions at its forthcom ing meeting when the final decisions as to the A and B mandates will it is hoped be taken A problem so intricate and involved as that of the mandates can hardly be handled by the interchange of formal notes It can only be satisfactorily solved by personal contact and by direct exchange of opinion Not only do such direct negotiations which correspond to the true spirit of the League of Nations effect an increase of freedom flexibility and speed but they create a spirit of mutual good will and co operation among people meeting around the same table As far as known this invitation has neither been accepted nor declined by the American Government If I were to make an appeal to the Government of the United States I should say Send a man to sit in at the Council Meeting to discuss the subject of man dates that is of vital interest to the United States and to the world as well 97

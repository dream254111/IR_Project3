J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1075828,THE RELATION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL TO THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND TO THE COLLEGE,I244533,THE RELATION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL TO THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND TO THE COLLEGE IN 1636 THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL OF THE MASSACHUSETTS COLONY VOTED AN APPROPRIATION FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF A COLLEGE SIX YEARS LATER IN 1642 AN ORDINANCE WAS PASSED REQUIRING ALL COMMUNITIES TO MAINTAIN COMMON SCHOOLS FOR THE INSTRUCTION OF THE CHILDREN FIVE YEARS LATER STILL IN 1647 ANOTHER ORDINANCE WAS PASSED REQUIRING EVERY COMMUNITY OF ONE HUNDRED FAMILIES OR MORE TO MAINTAIN A GRAMMAR SCHOOL WHICH SHOULD FIT THE YOUTHS FOR ENTRANCE TO THE COLLEGE THESE WERE THE EARLIEST EDUCATIONAL FOUNDATIONS IN THE NEW WORLD IT WAS BUT NATURAL THAT THEY SHOULD BE BASED UPON NOTIONS PREVAILING IN ENGLAND THE UNIVERSITY CAME FIRST TO FURNISH TRAINING TO THE SELECT YOUTH OF THE BETTER CLASS BEYOND THE POSSIBILITIES OF THE HOME AND PRIVATE SCHOOL THE COMMON SCHOOL CAME NEXT SINCE THE CONDITIONS PREVAILING IN THE NEW WILDERNESS RENDERED IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR EACH FAMILY EVEN OF THE BETTER CLASS TO PROPERLY PROVIDE FOR THE INSTRUCTION OF ITS OWN CHILDREN EVEN IN THE ELEMENTS THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL THE LINEAL ANCESTOR OF THE MODERN HIGH SCHOOL CAME LAST AS THE NECESSARY LINK TO CONNECT THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WITH THE COLLEGE THIS WAS ITS FIRST OFFICE AND THE MATTER OF CHIEF IMPORTANCE IN THAT EARLY DAY WAS ITS RELATION TO THE UNIVERSITY FOR MANY YEARS THE MAINTAINING OF THIS RELATION WAS CONSIDERED THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL AND IS YET BY SOME SO REGARDED THE HIGH SCHOOL WAS DOMINATED BY THE COLLEGE AND ITS COURSES OF STUDY WERE SO SHAPED THAT THE STUDENTS COMPLETING THEM MIGHT BE ABLE TO PASS THE COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS TO THIS END ALL THE ENERGIES OF THE SCHOOL WERE BENT AND THOSE STUDENTS WHO DID NOT INTEND TO GO TO COLLEGE WERE COMPELLED TO TAKE STUDIES THAT WERE DISTASTEFUL AND IN THEIR VIEW USELESS IF THEY WERE TO GET A HIGHSCHOOL TRAINING AT ALL THE RESULT IN MANY PARTS OF THE COUNTRY WAS A BITTER OPPOSITION TO HIGH SCHOOLS 167THE SCHOOL REVIEW THE FEELING GREW THAT THE HIGH SCHOOL WAS AN EXCLUSIVE INSTI TUTION SUPPORTED BY THE MANY FOR THE FEW IN A SENSE THIS FEEL ING WAS JUSTIFIABLE FOR WHILE THE DOORS WERE THEORETICALLY OPEN TO ALL THEY WERE REALLY CLOSED TO ALL WHO HAD NO DESIRE FOR THAT PAR TICULAR SORT OF TRAINING WHICH WAS INTENDED TO FIT FOR COLLEGE AND TO ALL WHO HOWEVER MUCH THEY MIGHT DESIRE SUCH TRAINING WERE UNABLE TO PURSUE THE PROPER COURSES TWENTYFIVE YEARS AGO ALL THROUGH THE MIDDLE STATES AND THE WEST THE HIGH SCHOOL WAS STRUGGLING FOR EXISTENCE MERELY BECAUSE IT HAD NOT FOUND ITS PLACE AS SOON AS IT BECAME THE PEOPLES COLLEGE OPEN TO ALL NOT MERELY THEORETICALLY BUT IN FACT AND OFFERING LIBERAL COURSES SUITED TO THE NEEDS OF ALL YOUTH THE OPPOSITION VANISHED IT WAS AN ILLUSTRATION IN A SMALL WAY OF ALL STRUGGLE FOR LIBERTY WHICH IS USUALLY BLIND BUT IN THE END SUCCESSFUL THE OUTGROWTH OF THIS PARTICULAR STRUGGLE WAS A MORE CAREFUL STUDY OF THE FUNC TION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL AND A RECASTING OF ITS COURSES OF STUDY IN BRIEF THE MODERN HIGH SCHOOL THE AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOL IS A UNIQUE INSTITUTION PRACTICALLY WITHOUT COUNTERPART IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE WORLD ENGLAND FRANCE AND GERMANY HAVE SCHOOLS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR IN NATURE BUT AS WIDELY DIFFERING IN EACH CASE AS THE GENIUS OF EACH OF THOSE PEOPLES DIFFERS FROM OUR OWN IT IS AN INSTITUTION WHICH HAS ITS JUSTIFICATION NOT CHIEFLY IN THE FACT THAT IT TAKES THE CHILDREN FROM THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS AND FITS THEM FOR ENTRANCE TO THE UNI VERSITY BUT IN THIS THAT IT OFFERS TO ALL ALIKE THE POSSIBILITY OF A HIGHER CULTURE THAN THE MAJORITY COULD OBTAIN IF OBLIGED TO RELY UPON PRIVATE RESOURCES IT IS BASED UPON THE NOTION THAT EVERY WELL EDUCATED CITIZEN IS WORTH TO THE STATE MORE THAN HE HAS COST THAT NOT MERELY ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE ELEMENTS OF KNOWLEDGE BUT BREADTH OF VIEW AND EXTENT OF CULTURE AND THE POSSESSION OF THOSE IDEALS WHICH COME FROM LIBERAL EDUCATION ARE THE SAFE GUARDS OF A FREE STATE AND THAT IT IS THE BUSINESS OF THE STATE TO OFFER THESE TO ALL WHO CAN POSSIBLY RECEIVE THEM THE REASON WHY THE DOMINATION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL BY THE COLLEGE WAS SO DISASTROUS WAS THAT THE COLLEGE ITSELF WAS SO NAR ROW LIBERAL CULTURE IN RECENT TIMES HAS COME INTO THE GREAT COLLEGES BY THE DOOR OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL AND THROUGH YIELDING I68RELATION OF HIGH SCHOOL TO COLLEGE TO POPULAR DEMAND AND IN IMITATION OF THE SOCALLED FRESH WATER COLLEGE OF THE MIDDLE AND FAR WEST AND WITH VERY FEW EXCEPTIONS IT HAS NOT COME FROM WITHIN THE COLLEGE ITSELF THE STUDY OF THE LITERATURE OF OUR OWN LANGUAGE WAS ALMOST UNKNOWN IN LARGE COLLEGES A QUARTER OF A CENTURY AGO THE SCI ENCES WERE JUST CREEPING IN WHILE NEARLY ALL THE WELLEQUIPPED HIGH SCHOOLS EVEN AT THAT TIME HAD FAIRLY GOOD COURSES IN BOTH THE CURRICULA OF THE COLLEGES CONSISTED ALMOST WHOLLY OF MATHEMATICS AND THE HUMANITIES NOW UNQUESTIONABLY THE STUDY OF THE HUMANITIES PROPERLY PURSUED IS ONE OF THE MOST VALUABLE IN ANY CURRICULUM BUT THIS STUDY WAS NOT PROPERLY PURSUED IT DID NOT LEAD TO AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE PEOPLES CONCERNED THEIR MAN NER OF LIVING THEIR IDEALS OR THEIR LITERATURES IT WAS A STUDY OF GRAMMAR NOW EVEN THE STUDY OF GRAMMAR MAY BE VERY BROAD ENING BUT THE COLLEGE WORK WAS NOT OF THAT SORT IT WAS A STUDY OF PARADIGMS AND RULES AND NOT OF THE METHOD OF THINKING WHICH LEADS TO ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE GENIUS OF A PEOPLE HENCE THERE WAS LITTLE TRAINING FOR ANY BUT THE LOGICAL FACULTY IT WAS THIS THAT LED TO THE REBELLION AGAINST THESE SUBJECTS A REBELLION SO GENERAL AND SO VIGOROUS AS TO CONSTITUTE A MOST INTERESTING EPOCH IN EDUCATIONAL HISTORY AND IT WAS MANIFESTED FIRST IN THE PEOPLES SCHOOLS THE COLLEGES WERE COMPELLED TO MODIFY THEIR COURSES IN ORDER TO DRAW FROM THE HIGH SCHOOLS THEY PRACTICALLY WERE COMPELLED TO ADMIT STUDENTS WHO HAD HAD LIBERALIZING STUDIES QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE FORMAL STUDIES UPON WHICH THEY HAD SET THEIR SEAL AND HAVING RECEIVED STUDENTS TRAINED IN THIS DIFFERENT WAY IT BECAME NECESSARY FOR THEM TO MODIFY THEIR COURSES HENCE THE STRUGGLE FOR THE FREEDOM OF THE HIGH SCHOOL HAS BEEN ONE OF THE GREAT INFLUENCES IN MAKING OVER COLLEGE WORK IN THIS COUNTRY IT IS REALLY OF GREATER IMPORTANCE TO THE COLLEGE THAN IT IS TO THE HIGH SCHOOL THAT THEIR RELATIONS BE HARMONIOUS BECAUSE IN GENERAL IN A SYSTEM OF EDUCATION WHILE THE HIGHER CAN SET ARBITRARY STAN DARDS THE LOWER NECESSARILY DOMINATES IN THE LONG RUN THERE IS STILL IN A FEW COLLEGES MAINTAINING THEIR MEDIEVAL IDEAS REBEL LION AGAINST ALL LIBERALITY AND THESE COLLEGES DRAW THEIR STUDENTS I69THE SCHOOL RE VIEW STILL QUITE LARGELY FROM THE FEW GREAT PRIVATE AND ENDOWED PRE PARATORY SCHOOLS WHOSE WORK IS STILL LARGELY MEDIEVAL THE RECENTLY APPOINTED COMMITTEE OF THE COLLEGES AND PRE PARATORY SCHOOLS OF THE MIDDLE STATES AND MARYLAND LOOKING TOWARD UNIFORM COLLEGEENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS MARKS A VERY GREAT STEP AND IS PERHAPS THE CHIEF PROOF OF THE LIBERALIZING INFLU ENCE WHICH THE HIGH SCHOOL HAS HAD UPON THE COLLEGE AND THE TIME WILL EVENTUALLY COME WHEN ANY YOUTH WHO HAS COMPLETED WELL A FAIR AND LIBERAL HIGHSCHOOL COURSE AND HAS SHOWN APTI TUDE FOR STUDY MAY BE RECEIVED INTO ANY COLLEGE AND THERE ALLOWED TO PURSUE THOSE COURSES OF STUDY FOR WHICH HE IS QUALI FIED INDEED THE RELATION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL TO THE COLLEGE MAY BE SAID TO BE PROVIDED FOR AND NEED GIVE US VERY LITTLE FURTHER WORRY TIME WILL WORK OUT ALL ITS EVOLUTION OF VASTLY GREATER IMPORTANCE TO HIGHSCHOOL PEOPLE IS THE RELATION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL TO THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS THE LITTLE BOSS UNDER THE BIG BOSS IS THE BOSSIEST BOSS OF ALL WHEN HIGH SCHOOLS WERE DOMINATED BY COLLEGES AND WHEN INSTEAD OF FURNISHING YOUTH FOOD AND SUNLIGHT AND STIMULUS TO GROWTH THEY WERE COMPELLED TO FIT THEM INTO FRAMES IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT FIT SIMILAR FRAMES WHEN THEY WERE PUT INTO THE COLLEGE THE HIGH SCHOOLS HAD THEIR REVENGE UPON THE GRAMMAR SCHOOLS OVER WHICH THEY DOMINEERED LIKE THE TRUE LITTLE BOSSES THAT THEY WERE SO COMPLETE WAS THEIR CONTROL THAT IN MANY CASES AND I THINK QUITE COMMONLY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY HIGHSCHOOL TEACHERS USED TO PREPARE THE EXAMINATION QUESTIONS FOR ADMISSION TO THE HIGH SCHOOL AND MARK THE PAPERS SO THAT IN CASE ANY LIFE AND JUICE DID REMAIN IN ANY OF THE POOR CHILDREN AFTER THE NARROW GROOVES INTO WHICH THEY HAD BEEN FITTED IN THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL IT WAS SQUEEZED OUT IN THE PROCESS OF TRANSFER TO THE HIGH SCHOOL THE HIGH SCHOOL WAS THE GREAT SIFTING GROUND WHERE ONLY THE SELECT FEW WHO COULD DO THE FORMAL STUNTS SET BY THE HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER WERE SUPPOSED TO ENTER IF ANY OTHERS DID CHANCE TO GET IN THEY WERE SOON HUSTLED OUT THE CONTINUAL COMPLAINT ALL ALONG THE LINE HAS EVER BEEN FROM THE HIGHER INSTITUTIONS TO THE LOWER YOU DO NOT PROPERLY PREPARE YOUR I70RELATION OF HIGH SCHOOL TO COLLEGE STUDENTS FOR OUR WORK YOU MUST LET US TELL YOU WHAT THEY MUST KNOW THE COLLEGE SAID IT TO THE HIGH SCHOOL AND THE HIGH SCHOOL SAID IT WITH REDOUBLED VENOM TO THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL SECONDARY EDUCATION WAS REGARDED AS A SPECIAL PRIVILEGE AND I HAVE HEARD HIGHSCHOOL TEACHERS ADVOCATE STRONGLY THE FREEZ ING OUT OF THE INCOMPETENT THAT IS OF THOSE WHO FAIL TO CONFORM TO THEIR PARTICULAR USUALLY ARTIFICIAL STANDARDS NOW THE GRAM MAR SCHOOL HAS AS GOOD A RIGHT TO ITS OWN IDEALS AS THE HIGH SCHOOL ITS BUSINESS IS TO FURNISH TO THE CHILDREN THAT COME TO IT A WISE AND WHOLESOME LIFE WITH AN ABUNDANCE OF FOOD AND SUN LIGHT THAT THEY MAY GROW TO THE FULLEST STATURE POSSIBLE THERE IS NO MORE REASON WHY IT SHOULD BE RESTRICTED BY THE FORMAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE HIGH SCHOOL THAN WHY THE HIGH SCHOOL SHOULD BE RESTRICTED BY THE FORMAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE COLLEGE NOR IS THERE ANY REASON IN A FREE STATE WHY THE DULL AND ABNORMAL THOSE WHO FAIL TO CONFORM TO SET STANDARDS SHOULD BE DEPRIVED OF THE PRIVILEGE OF SUCH BROADER CULTURE AS THEY CAN RECEIVE IN A HIGH SCHOOL THE RELATION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL TO THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SHOULD NOT BE THAT OF AN EXCLUSIVE INSTITUTION BUT RATHER OR AN INCLUSIVE I REMEMBER YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS A YOUNG AND BUMPTIOUS HIGHSCHOOL PRINCIPAL COMPLAINING BITTERLY TO THE SUPERINTENDENT THAT THE PUPILS COMING FROM THE GRAMMAR SCHOOLS WERE NOT PRE PARED AND BEING VERY MUCH HUMILIATED BY HIS REPLY THAT IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS YOUR BUSINESS IS TO TAKE THE CHILDREN THAT COME TO YOU FROM THE GRAMMAR SCHOOLS AND DO YOUR BEST WITH THEM I WILL LOOK AFTER THE GRAMMAR SCHOOLS IT DID ME GOOD AND IT IS SOUND PHILOSOPHY THE BUSINESS OF THE HIGH SCHOOL IN RELATION TO THE ELEMEN TARY SCHOOLS IS TO TAKE THOSE PUPILS WHO HAVE RECEIVED THE MAXI MUM OF BENEFIT POSSIBLE TO THEM FROM THE GRAMMAR SCHOOLS AND WHO CAN GET MORE FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL AND GIVE THEM ALL THAT THEY CAN TAKE MUCH VALUABLE TIME IS LOST EVERY YEAR WHEN PUPILS ENTER THE HIGH SCHOOL BY ATTEMPTS TO MEASURE THEM UP TO A FORMAL STANDARD AND BY COMPLAINTS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT MEAS URE WELL SOMETIMES THE FAULT IS IN THE MEASURER RATHER THAN IN THE MEASURED BUT IN ANY CASE IT IS A WASTE OF TIME HIGHSCHOOL I 7 IZHE SCHOOL REVIEW TEACHERS SHOULD FIND OUT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THE ATTAINMENTS OF PUPILS WHO COME TO THEM AND THEN SHOULD PROCEED TO TEACH THEM I DO NOT WISH TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS IMPLYING THAT THERE SHOULD BE ANY COMPULSION OR HARSHNESS OR DISAGREEMENT INDEED I THINK MANY OF THE DIFFICULTIES COULD BE DONE AWAY WITH WERE THERE CONFERENCES AND MUTUAL ACQUAINTANCE THE APPOINTMENT OF THE COMMITTEE ON UNIFORM COLLEGE REQUIREMENTS THE MOST FAR REACHING IN EDUCATIONAL MATTERS OF THIS DECADE GREW OUT OF THE ANNUAL CONFERENCE IN WHICH SECONDARY AND COLLEGE TEACHERS MET AND TALKED THINGS OVER SIMILAR CONFERENCES ON THE PART OF GRAMMARSCHOOL TEACHERS AND HIGHSCHOOL TEACHERS I AM SURE WOULD BE OF GREAT VALUE AS THE TIME FOR PROMOTION APPROACHES THE HIGHSCHOOL AND GRAMMARSCHOOL TEACHERS COULD MEET SOCIALLY AND DISCUSS SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT CONCERN THEM BOTH AND LIKE SIGNIFICANT RESULTS WOULD FOLLOW UNQUESTIONABLY THE HIGHER SCHOOL MUST ALWAYS EXERT AN INFLUENCE OVER THE LOWER IT DOES AND MUST SET A STANDARD BUT THAT STANDARD SHOULD IN ALL CASES BE BROAD AND GENERAL RATHER THAN NARROW AND SPECIFIC AND TECHNICAL EACH SCHOOL CALLED BY WHATEVER NAME FROM THE KINDERGARTEN THROUGH THE UNIVERSITY HAS A SUFFICIENT EXCUSE FOR ITS EXISTENCE IN THAT IT HAS A DEFINITE BUSINESS TO DO WHICH IS TO FURNISH THE STUDENTS WITHIN ITS PRE CINTS THE BEST POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY AND STIMULUS FOR GROWTH ALL TEACHERS SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT ALL OTHERS OCCUPY EQUALLY DIGNIFIED POSITIONS AND HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME KIND OF WORK TO DO MAKING WAY FOR THE GROWTH OF THE CHILD IF THERE IS TO BE ANY DOMINATION OF ONE OVER THE OTHER THE ONE BELOW NECESSARILY DOMINATES THE ONE ABOVE AS WE ADVANCE FROM GRADE TO GRADE EACH HIGHER GRADE IS NECESSARILY TO A DEGREE EXCLUSIVE CERTAIN STUDENTS WILL HAVE REACHED THEIR LIMITS IN THE GRADES BELOW THE INCOMPETENT AND UNFORTUNATE WILL DROP OUT THIS IS IN OBEDIENCE TO A NATURAL LAW IT CANNOT BE WHOLLY OVERCOME BUT THIS FACT FURNISHES NO EXCUSE FOR ACCENTING THIS LAW AND MAKING THE GRADES INTENTION ALLY AND OF PURPOSE EXCLUSIVE ON THE CONTRARY IT IS THE BUSI NESS OF THE SCHOOL OF WHATEVER GRADE TO PREVENT AS MANY AS POSSIBLE FROM DROPPING OUT 172RELA TION OF HIGHSCHOOL TO COLLEGE I 73 THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST IS A LAW OF NATURE CIVILIZATION MEANS THE MASTERY AND USE OF NATURE THE BUSINESS OF THE HIGHER CIVILIZATION IS NOT TO EMPHASIZE A MERE NATURAL LAW BUT TO CONTROL IT USE IT AND DOMINATE IT BY A HIGHER SPIRITUAL LAW THE HIGHER SPIRITUAL LAW WHICH IS TO REPLACE AND CONTROL THE LOWER MATERIAL NATURAL LAW OF THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST IS THAT WHICH IS THE BASIS OF ALL TRUE RELIGION AND EDUCATION THE SAV ING OF THE CHILDREN OF MEN THE MAKING THE UNFIT FIT THIS WOULD BE A GOOD MOTTO FOR EVERY HIGHSCHOOL TEACHER AND EVERY GRAMMARSCHOOL TEACHER AND EVERY COLLEGE TEACHER NO MATTER HOW UNFIT THE CHILD OR YOUTH COMING TO ME FOR INSTRUCTION MY BUSINESS IS TO REMOVE THAT UNFITNESS AND MAKE HIM FIT NOT ONLY FOR THE ENJOYMENT OF LIFE BUT FOR SERVICE C B GILBERT NEWARK N J

j100066,The American Journal of Psychology,1410939,Notes,i261571,NOTES In the April number of Mtnd Prof Royce suggests that sane persons may be subject to illusions of memory similar to the false memories that occur in cases of insanity like those studied by Eraepelin and others and he thinks that the liability to such illusions may account for some of the stories of haunted houses telepathy and the like reported by honest witnesses A great deai of research and observation is required to determine how common such illusions of memory are among normal persons Several philosophers however have noticed that illusions of memory occur in dreams and judging from the writers own experience sllch phenomena are not uncommon Several dreams illustrative of paramnesia have come to ms notice One of my own dreams may serve as a sample It was substantially as follows I visited the editor of a well known periodical and inquired about the manu script of an article that I had sent him some time before and wof which I had received no tidings The editor made an evasive anssver that indicated to me that he had never read the manuscript but that he was unwilling to confess it I remembered the fact of having sent the article clearly enough and the answer that my dream put into the mouth of the editor would indicate that I had no doubt of it The facts of my waking life were these I had often contributed to the periodical in question but no manuscript had ever been rejected A short time before my dream however I had sent an article to a newspaper and had received no word from it whatever Here was clearly a case of false memors unless we suppose it a true memory of a former dream state which had been forgotten in the waking state just as the events of an hypnotic trance are remembered in succeeding trances while forgotten ln the waking state W H B Another evidence of the set among thoughtful men of quite diverse philosophical tendencies toward a thorough and scientific considera tion of some of the more obscure questions of psychology is to be found in the recent organization of the Gesellschaft fur Experi mentalPsychologie in Berlin and in the program adopteel by them published in the May number of the Sphinz They propose to study in general the phenomena of mans psychic life that occur under unusual circumstances natural or experimental and which in a way are a borderland between the normal and pathological First among these is hypnotism in the wide acceptation of the term  next telepathy and related states and in a secondary way as probably in a manller connected with these the phenomena of spiritualism They rely chiefly upon the experimentaT method and have based on its use a distinction of their branch of psychology from the introspec tive and physiological Other methods are however not to be excluded Spontaneous cases will be treated statisticaliy and his tory and ethnology will be made tributary The society as a society736 PSliCCHOLOGIAL LITERATURE will confine itself to facts leaving their philosophical interpretation to indvidual preference All can therefore cooperate who recog nize the significance of the field of study

Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asy lum bearing on the relations of epilepsy and crime From Febru ary 1864 to February 1887 1266 male and 394 female patients were admitted of the maies 105 and of the females 23 were epilep tic or in percentages 82 and 58 Of the male epileptics 67 had committed homicidal offenses of the female 18 and four other males had been guity of personal violence to themselves or others Only 34 epileptic males and 5 epileptic females had com mitted other crimes Of the whole number of homicidal insane admitted 768 11 per cent were epileptic while of the 892 nonhomi cidal admissions only 48 per cent were epileptic It thus appears that criminal epileptles are prone to crimes of violence especially to homicides Further tables on the basis of 128 cases show that among the male epileptics the majority were single while among the females a majority were married Of the same 128 the age of greatest criminal activity including homicides was for the males from 25 to 30 years for the females betweell 20 and 25 and between 35 and 40 It would also appear from records as to the setiology of the disease that epilepsies from traumatic causes are more apt to show a homicidal character than those of congenital and idiopathic origin Thirtyone of 105 male cases show a history of intem perance In the Journcbl of Mentosl Sczence for July 1888 Dr S A K Strallan reports four cases of recovery after long periods of insanity All were women and in all the recovery seems to have begun in the general nervous reconstruction of the climacteric In the AqneriGan Jotsrncbl of Inessnsty for July Dr J A Campknell of the Counties Asylum Carlisle England aives three cases of recovery after long periods of asylum life The first was a woman whose menstruation was accompanied by violent maniacal attacks These declined in violence and she was discharged after seventeen years of asylum life But one attack and that very slight indeed occurred after menstruation ceased The second a man began to improve after a severe illness of another nature and was discharged after nineteen years The third was a woman of fiftyone whose derangement followed the menopause  she recovered after fourteen years The doctor queries since it is rare to find brain lesions to account for delusions and the like if brain scars like surface scars may not grow out and more or less completely disappear in long perlods of time A paper on  The Treatment of Nervous and Mental Disease by Systematized Active Exercise by Dr C K Mills is reported in abstract in the Polyclinzc for Februarv 1888 Active exercise and proper hygiene besides combating that low nlltrition which is the soil of much nervous elisease have been found useful in the treatPSYCHOLOGICAL LITERATURE 137 ment of such diseases as idiocy insanity asthma minor chorea habit chorea hysteria general nervousness neurasthenia nervous palpitations lithaemia cerebral syphilis diabetes curvatures ataxias paralyses muscular atrophy aphonia and writers disease In some of these the exercise assists in the establishment of proper nervous habits and of rapport between the will and the muscles in others it brings calm in yet others it helps exeretion This paper is said to be the forerunner of a book on the subject Dr Seymore J Sharkey reports in the April number of Brtn a  case of atrophy of the frontal and parietal lobes of the brain conse quent on longcontinued paralysis of the limbs from spinal disease The patient mTas bedridden for two vears and a half with paralysis of both legs and the right hand and for a year before her death with partial paralysis of the left hand and arm Sensation  as slightly and infrequently afTected and intellection not at all Postmortem examination showed atrophy in both frontal and both parietal lobes particularly in the upper ends of the ascending parietal convolutions on the right and the superior parietal lobule The left corlesponded with noticeable atrophy of the middle third of the parietal convolu tion and in a less degree of the frontal convolutions The tempero sphenoidal and occipital lobes on botll sides were contrastingly  ell nourished The case illustrates again the location of the centres of voluntary motion A cut of the patients brain accompanies the account of the case Dr Sharkey also reports in the same place a case where a tumor on the left auditory nerve caused noise and deafness in the left ear and dizziness similar to that produced in animals on sectionina thZe auditory nerve or destroying the semicircular canals phenomena wllich have by some been attributed to injuries attending the section ing as in the experiments the dizziness seemed to decrease with time A cut of the patients brain is given here also Fletcher Beach the

instabiiity that develops into it on occasion of some later shock In the Revssta Spersmentale Vol XIII fasc 2 Oct 1887 trans lated in the Alsensst and Let4rologist April 1888 Prof Tamburini gives a very interesting account of a young Italian girl and her visions of the Madonna The girl was thirteen years oAd of neuro pathic heredity and at the first appearance of the vision under great emotional excitement and fresh from severe physical exercise She saw in a juniper bush a bambsna about her own size dressed in white rosycheeked darkeTed lighthaired a blue wreath about its neck a silver cross on its breast and its hands folded It answered questions put to it Presently among the superstitious738 PSYHOLOGIAL LITERATURE populace the juniper bush began to work miracles and the whole thlng had finally to be suppressed by the authorities The condi tion of the gir when she came soon after under Prof Tamburinis observation was rather hysterical  there was slight left hemianaes thesia she had pains and deafness in the left ear and some hyperaemia of the fundus of the eyes  her muscular force was small She was excitable capricious and egoistic  had been brought up in enforced punctiliousness in religious matters Her visions nvere true hallucinations but her mind once freed from them was not apparently unbalanced Prof Nasse Zeitschrift f Psych XLIV H 4 N 5 noted in Neurol aentralbt No 9 May 1 1888 contends for the existence of secondarj paranoia t e developing out of melancholia or mania and further that the development may be sudden Three cases are given ali women two melancholiac and one maniacal in which such a change took place suddenly The connection of paranoia with hallucinations of hearing has frequently been remarked Dr Theo W Fisher in an article on the subject in the Am Jot4rnat of Insanity July 1888 gives a table of 243 cases of insanity in the Boston Lunatic Hospital from which it appears that 63 per cent and probably more if the history of the early stages were more perfect have been hallucinated at some period of theirdisease Eightnlnthsofthesehadhadhallu cinations of hearing Fifty per cent of the cases of acute mania and general paralysis had teen hallucinated and 91 per cent of the melancholiacs excluding those of the simple form which like those of folie circulaire showed nothing of the kind The 47 cases of paranoia all showed hallucinations and all but two hallacinations of hearing seeming to demonstrate more than an accidental con nection Dr William Noyes has made a valuable addition to the literature of insanity accessible in English in his translation of J S6glass historical study of paranoia now reproduced in pamphlet form from the March April May and June numbersof the Joq4rnatof Nereoqbs and Mentat Dsease The work is a concise resumd of a large amount of literature in French German Italian and English In his anniversary address before the Anthropological Institute Jot4rnal of the Anthrop Inst May 1888 Francis Galton gave some account of the anthropometric laboratory then soon to be opened at the South Kensington Museum The plan is to be that of the one at the International Health Exhibition in 1884 The object is not only to give those desiring accurate measurement an opportunity for it and to keep a record of such measurements but also to give information on anthropometrical methods and a place for such research The laboratory must be able to measure quicklv and conveniently a large number of people It is confined therefore to measurements that can be made on persons in ordinary clothing but valuable data can even thus be gathered The remalnder of the paper is an explana tion of the system of identification measurements of M Bertillon mentioned in Vol I page 205 of this journalPSTCHOLOGIAL LITERATURE 739 Dr Ottolenghi from tests made on eighty persons concludes that eriminals are defieient in the sense of smell A case of stigmatism is reported in the June number of the Sphtnx The stigmatist is a certain Sister Napelle of the Order de le misdri eorde in the Freneh eonvent at Chas in Auvergne Carl Kiesewetter in the July nunlber of Sphttn gives a brief aeeount of the ineantations used by the aneient Akkadians to expel disease or the eosmic demons that caused it or to transfer it to inanimate objects a la Paraeelsus He gives German versions of two or three of the formulas In a paper read before the Anthropological Institute and reported in Natsre May 31888 Franeis Galton makes some ealculations of the headgrowth of students at the University of Cambridge from tables of  headproducts  presented by Dr Venn The  headproduet  is the product of the length breadth and height of the head above a fised plane and while it of course far exceeds the actual brain volume lt may be taken on the average as proportional to it The measurements were made upon men from 19 to 25 years old and upward in number as follows high honor men 2tS8 other honor men 47G  poll  men 361 The average headproduct in inches for high honor men at 19 is 2419 for other honor men 2371 for the  poll  men 2291 that is to say high honor men have heads nearly 5 per cent larger than the  poll  men Omitting the figures for the intermediate years at 25 or over they are respectively 2489 2391 and 2435 showing growth in all and especially ill the  poll  men whose average  headproduct  has increased 6 per eent against 3 per eent for the high honor men From these figures it is to be concluded that the brains of university men continue to grow after the age at whieh growth ceases among men at large which is 19 or earlier that high honor men have larger and earlier developed brains than others and consequently that university distinetion may be taken as an evidence of these advantages In an article on the Life Statistics of an Indian Province Natsre July 12 1888 S A Hill shows that violent deaths suieides and wounds are at a minimum in the colder months increase in fre quency durillg the dry and hot season and remain high through the rainy season The  irritability of temper consequent on long eon tinued heat and moisture  is suggested as a possible reason When the birth rates are arranged by months they are found to be at a maximum in September and October 5671 per mille in September and at a minimum in May and June 3543 per mille in June This points to December as the month of most frequent conception and September as that of the least In September the end of the long hot period the vitality of the people is at ebb and the food supply low In Deeember on the contrary climatic eonditions are favorable and food abundant November being the month of harvest Thus there appears to be a human  pairing time  eontrolled by physieal eon ditions The fact that the Holi or spring festival of the Hindus which has been considered as a relic of sueh a  pairing time  does not agree with the one found from the figures is to be expiained the author conjectures by the importation of the festival from a eolder habitat740 PSYCHOLOGICAL LITERATURE In the lEet6rot Centratbtatt for March 1 1888 Prof Fr Fuchs recounts a simple observation on himself tending to show that the hallucinatory images seen by many persons in the moment of dropping oS to sleep are influeIlced in their localization by the posi tion of the head The professor noticed in going to sleep in a night train that these images appeared to move about keeping time to the motions of his head produced by the shaking of the car The associatioll of colors and sounds is not of very illfrequent occurrence Lauret and Duchaussoy report a case BtzZZ d I ASoc de Paychologze phye III p 11 noted in Gentratbt f Phyeot No 5 June 9 1888 of a family in which the father son and daughter have very distinct color sensations on hearing and seeing letters or even thinking of them The vowel colors are bright the consonants shades of gray Numberwords have colors likewise but unrelated to the letters with which they are spelled The colors for particular letters are not the same for the father and daughter  the son was not examined in this particular Cases in which colors are called out by other senses than hearing are infrequent but not unknown Colored smelling has heen observed and Dr Ch Fere mentioned at a meeting of the Societew de Biologie of Paris in December of last year reported in the Ne6rot Gentratbt No 10 1888 a case of colored tasting A woman after a plentiful use of vinegar saw everything red for a few minutes and after that for more than an hour evervthing bright green Some thing similar happens among melanclioliacs and the neuropathic without any exciting sensation Dr Feres explanation of such double sensations is something as follows On stimulation of any sense there is called forth in addition to the special sensation a mass of physiological attendants changes of muscle tension of circula tion and of orgallic functions generally If now exactly the same mass of secondary efEects are called up by the stimulation of two senses e g sight and hearing the two sensations are confused by the percipient he perceives them together has color sensations with spoken letters etc If we reflect that these physiological attendants are on the subjective side probably feelings or indistinct emotions we may take the liberty of stating Dr Feres explanation thus Stimulation of one of these senses calls up an emotional state common to both whicll in its turn calls up tlle other sensation W Griffiths in studying the rhythmic waves in the myograph tracings of voluntarily contracted muscles Jobrnat of Physot IX 1 p 39 noted in Gentrtbt f  Physot No 9 1888 found them to differ for different muscles for different individuals and for the same individ ual at difEerent times The number was increased to a certain point by loading the muscle or exercising it but beyond that point it again decreased The general rate for muscles without a load and of muscles at  dead strain was the same for the biceps about 14 per sec for the muscle of the ball of the thumb about 10 Fatigue decreased the number but increased the extent of the waves They represent in the authors opinion the impulses of innervation  he discards the rate derived from the tone of contracting muscle i95 per sec With the view of determining experimentally whether deep tones are heard with

William O Moore of New York reported three cases of hyster ical blindness in males Two were monocular  one of them a boy of fifteen having lost the sight of his right eye  after a disappolnt ment at school The application of prisms gave double images showing that the alleged blindness was imaginary They were told that they M ould soon be well and recovered accordingly under elec trical treatment The other case conceived from the effect of atropine used in testing his eyes for glasses that he was going blind put on dark glasses afterfward bandages would not open his eyes and for ten months before he was examined by Dr Moore had stayed in the dark with his eyes covered He was examined under ether and on recourering consciousness evidently could see He was assured of recovery and  in two jays he was walking around with out glasses and has had no trouble since M Nonne in the Neufrol 7entrsslblsstt Nos 7 and 8 1888 noted in aentralbt f Phys No 6 1888 contributes to hypnotic therapeutics the case of a typesetter who was successfully treated by that means in a third attack of hysterical paralysis and anaesthesia complicated perhaps with leadpoisoning The suggestion was made by aegrees e g  tomorrow you will be able to move your left great toe etc and the disease which in the right arm was of five years standing was in this manner completely removed One of the most prominent advocates outside of France of the therapeutic use of hypnotism is Prof August Forel In several articles on the subject 7orregpondenzbl f Schtoetzer Aerzte 1887 Miinchen rned Wochenechr 1888 Nos 5 and 13 noted in asntbt f Phyrol No 5 1888 he makes clear his conviction that hypnotism is a genuine remedial agent adapted hon1vever rather to functional nervous disorders of mentally sound patients pains chronic rheuma tism insomnia etc than to psychoses It succeeds best of course with those most open to suggestion and whose disease is of recent origin Prof Forel has been successful in treating alcohol and mor phine habit in this way securing in some cases what seems to be a complete cure He belongs to the Nancy school and hypnotizes by uggestion

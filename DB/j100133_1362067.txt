j100133,The Condor,1362067,Notes on the Wading Birds of the Barr Lake Region Colorado,i259160,July 1912 117 NOTES ON THE WADING BIRDS OF THE BARR LAKE REGION COLORADO By ROBERT B ROCKWELL WITH THIRTEEN PHOTOS BY THE AUTHOR HE previous papers relating to the birdlife of the Barr Lake region which have appeared in THE CONDOR have dealt with species which either through their relative abundance or through the ease with which their nests were located have made possible a more or less connected account of their breeding habits The species mentioned in this paper are on the other hand species which breed in such limited numbers or whose nesting habits vary so little as to Fig 44 TYPICAL NEST AND EGGS OF BITTERN make an extended study of these habits either impossible or so little removed from the ordinary as to be unworthy of publication It will therefore be the purpose of this paper as far as is practicable to lay before the reader even at the risk of a disconnected recital only those facts which throw new light upon the habits of this very interesting class of birds As an aid to easy reference it is probably best to treat each species separately in the order of the A O U nomen clature Botaurus lentiginosus AMERICAN BITTERN Bitterns were among the commonest birds around all the rushbound ponds but owing to their retiring habits they were seldom seen except when flushed and as they were close sitters fewer nests were found than the relative abundance All the notes upon which this paper is based were taken in company with L J Hersey118 THE CONDOR Vol XIV of the birds would lead one to expect All the nests found by us conformed closely to the published descriptions and there was practically no variation in material construction or location The young are very queer looking little balls of yellowish down from which protrudes a long sharp bill and the most malig nant pair of eyes to be found in the bird world In fact I know of no bird dispo sition that could equal that of these helpless little creatures in genuine cussed ness The slightest noise or motion transforms the cuddling little chicklets into evillooking little fiends that attack an outstretched finger or strike with the ferocity of a tiger Their note of anger is a loud forbidding hiss very snakelike in quality possibly a natural protection from the bullsnakes which infest their nesting grounds and more than one nest was found that would have otherwise been passed by but for the demonstration occasioned by our approach As soon Fig 45 YOUNG BITTERNS IN NEST as they are able to leave the nest this aggressive nature deserts them and they are the same skulking secretive birds as the mature adults although they show some fight if handled One peculiar example of bittern nature came to our notice While work ing through a very dense cover of cattails and rushes we came upon an adult bittern which permitted us to pick it up A thorough examination failed to reveal any injury so we decided to photograph our captive However when we endeavored to pose him he would either flop down in a most dejected heap or would dart for the rushes with most surprising speed which would be the occa sion for some highly edifying for the other fellow speed tests upon our part Finally after a dozen fruitless attempts we decided to see if his wings were injured so tossed him as high as possible into the air He very promptly andJuly 1912 NOTES ON WADING BIRDS OF BARR LAKE REGION COLORADO 119 gracefully took wing and our last glimpse of him showed him flying true and strong over half a mile away Whatever induced that bird to permit us to pick him up and handle him in the way we did will of course remain a mystery The birds arrived in the latter part of April the 25th and eggs were laid the latter part of May An unusually early nest contained three young and two eggs May 26 1906 A nest containing two fresh eggs on May 24 1907 contained freshly hatched young on June 22 The young develop much faster than young of the Night Herons and upon the strength of rather scanty data I think they leave the nests within two weeks after hatching Rallus virginianus VIRGINIA RAIL Porzana carolina SORA Both species of rails nested in large numbers the Virginias apparently being somewhat commoner than the Soras Both species frequented the lush wet Fig 46 NEST AND EGGS OF SORA SHOWING GRASSES BROKEN DOWN OVER NEST TO FORM A SORT OF CANOPY seepage land and the nests were almost without exception found in clumps of dense long roundstemmed marsh grass The concealment of these nests was wonderful fully equalling if not surpassing the best concealed nests of the Teal ducks It was practically impossible to flush the birds directly from their nests They would skulk through the grass for a dozen feet or more and then take flight Even where we knew the location of the nest and dashed up at full speed we were seldom able to make the bird take directly to the air The habit of the Soras of bending over the tops of the grasses and rushes surrounding the nest to form a sort of canopy over it is I believe peculiar to this species and well built nests of this type are among the most beautiful of the ground nests120 THE CONDOR Vol XIV Eight eggs appeared to be the average set of the Virginia Rail although one set of eleven eggs was found On the other hand we encountered several birds incubating very small sets Two or three sets of three and four incubated eggs were examined and one persistent bird found with a nest containing one egg on May 18 1907 was visited weekly and was still brooding the single egg three weeks later on June 8 The young rails leave the nest very soon after hatching and are quite noisy Several young Virginias examined were covered with coarse jet black down The Sora sets averaged somewhat larger sets of ten and eleven being com mon and two sets numbering thirteen and fourteen eggs respectively were found In many instances one or more eggs from a nest would be found on the ground near the nest whether displaced intentionally or accidentally by the parent we could not discover The average date for fresh eggs of the Soras was about Fig 47 TYPICAL NEST EGG AND YOUNG OF COOT June 15 and we found that many of the sets hatched about July first but the Virginias were fully a month earlier One halfgrown young Virginia was found June 15 1907 and a week later the rushes abounded with them One belated set of seven fresh eggs was found July 6 Data is accumulating steadily that will eventually place the Virginia Rail definitely among regular Colorado winter residents Fulica americana CooT Second only to the Yellowheaded Blackbirds in numbers come the Coots Every lake and pond was alive with them and literally thousands of these birds are hatched every year along the Barr chain The nesting season extends through May June and July Our earliest complete set was found April 27 the first egg of which must have been laid April 18 This set hatched May 11 Nests with eggs were seen as late as July 21 and immature birds were much in eviJuly 1912 NOTES ON WADING BIRDS OF BARR LAKE REGION COLORADO 121 dence until early August In the large number of nests examined were found wide variation in construction and location Most of the nests were built well out toward the edge of the cattails over water three or four feet deep others were built in close to shore in very dense cattail thickets One nest was found built on dry ground another fully two feet above the ground on a platform of dead cattails with a neat runway leading up to it and still another nest fully four feet above ground in the lower branches of an apple tree the water of the lake having receded that much after having inundated the orchard Two nests were seen far out on open water that were readily visible at a distance of one hundred yards One nest was found that looked exactly like a grebes nest another was built entirely of weedstraws still another entirely of freshly cut green cattails and one over deep water was made entirely from green moss brought up from the bottom of the lake Complete sets ranged in number from six to thirteen and one set at present in the writers collection contains seventeen eggs Minute ex amination of this set has failed to reveal two types of eggs as would likely be the case if this set was the product of two birds When found the eggs in this set were arranged in two layers in the nest and even then it must have been practically impossible for the brooding female to cover the entire clutch In several instances we proved that an egg was deposited each day Incuba tion is apparently not begun until the set is complete as all the eggs in a nest usually hatched on the same day The parent birds when disturbed during incubation have a very peculiar fashion of swimming out a few yards from the nest uttering a low moaning or croaking note of protest Then with head low over the water feathers puffed out and wings held away from the body the bird will suddenly rise just off the water and by kicking rapidly back ward with both feet will send a shower of spray in the general direction of the intruder This performance will often be repeated time after time and is a very grotesque and expressive method of exhibiting the birds displeas ure The parents are quite devoted to their nests but will seldom allow one to approach closer than a dozen yards before seeking safety out on the water but seldom if ever do they take flight upon leaving the nest and then only in cases where they are greatly surprised Fig 48 NEST OF COOT BUILT ON PLATFORM OF DEAD RUSHES TWO FEET ABOVE GROUND WITH RUNWAY LEADING UP TO EGGS122 THE CONDOR Vol XIV The young are covered with coarse black down with a bald spot on the top of their heads of a livid red color They swim with wonderful strength and speed a baby only a couple of days old swimming almost as fast as a man can walk They take advantage of natural cover much as the young grebes do but seem less wild than any of the other young wild birds Steganopus tricolor WILSON PHALAROPE The most baffling bird as regards nesting habits with which our field work brought us in contact was this pretty phalarope In point of numbers they were second only to the Killdeer among the shore birds and throughout the nesting season there was hardly a trip in which we did not encounter parent birds whose actions made it plain that we were very close to their nests yet in all these trips Fig 49 FREAK NEST OF COOT COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF YELLOW WEED STALKS scattered over several years the writer has been favored with the sight of but two nests The birds arrived late in April and by May 10 were seen in goodly numbers usually in flocks of fifty or more A week or two later the birds were still in flocks but were apparently mated During 1906 evidences of nesting were not noted until June 10 in 1907 no anxious parents were noted until June 15 but in 1908 the birds were unusually numerous and showed every indication of the prox imity of nests as early as May 29 In fact one of the two nests mentioned above was found June 16 and on that date contained three young just hatched and one egg which was afterward found to contain a fully developed dead embryo This nest was a scanty affair of dry grass built in sparse marsh grass fully 100 feetJuly1912 NOTES ON WADING BIRDS OF BARR LAKE REGION COLORADO 123 from the shore line on a small island and was upon thoroughly dry ground The nest was discovered through the telltale actions of the parent That the nests are wonderfully well concealed both through the protective col oration of the eggs and through the cunning of the parent birds is beyond question yet this alone would hardly explain our lack of success in finding these nests for had the birds been actually nesting in the numbers their relative abundance would seem to indicate it would hardly have been possible for us to fail in our search so consistently The suggestion was offered that while the birds were quite abundant each year possibly only a small proportion of them were breeding birds and that the nonbreeders joined the breeding birds in a demonstration when the intruder approached the nesting site The fact that throughout the nesting sea son Phalaropes were seen in flocks of various sizes would seem to support this theory Recurvirostra americana AVOCET Among the most interesting experiences during the Barr lake work was our study of the nesting Avocets The birds first made their appearance the last week in April 1907 and on account of their size and conspicuous coloring they were easy to keep track of We kept a sharp lookout for their nesting site throughout May and June and finally decided that they must be breeding on a small island far out in the big lake A trip to the island on June 30 failed to reveal any nests although the birds showed every evi dence of having nests nearby On July 4 1907 we visited the island again and as we landed a female Avocet flew up about twentyfive yards back from shore and upon walking directly to this spot we found a nest containing four eggs About twenty yards from this point we found a second and thirty yards farther on a third each containing four incubated eggs The nests were all located in very similar locations among a young growth of cockleburrs not over six inches in height and which had probably grown at least half of that since the eggs were laid The cockleburrs formed a belt about ten yards wide clear around the island just below the dense bluestem and other rank grass with which the island was covered and on ground that was under water during the high water of the spring although inundated for a short time only Two of the nests were very crude affairs being a mere shallow hollow in the sand with a very few dead weed stalks of short lengths arranged around the eggs The Fig 50 NESTING SITE OF AVOCET ON ISLANDTHE CONDOR Vol XIV other was constructed in the same manner but was quite well lined with weed stems so that the eggs did not touch the ground There was no evident attempt at concealment the nests all being placed in small open spaces from six inches to a foot in diameter and with nothing to protect them but the color of the eggs was sufficient protection to make them quite inconspicuous The birds continually showed signs of uneasiness staying usually at the edge of the water and occasionally flying over us with their loud ringing cry Sometimes they would affect a broken wing but the effort was rather awkward and the deception was very apparent They acted much as a Killdeer does and while quite demonstrative did not betray the whereabouts of the nests by their actions only that they flushed from them directly instead of running along the Fig 51 NEST AND EGGS OF AVOCET ground before taking wing When not flying about overhead the birds often lit on the water where they swam easily and lightly and they seemed at all times very anxious to get back to the nests returning as soon as we were a short dis tance from the nests Upon our return to the island on June 21 we found that the nests had been disturbed two of them were deserted and about half of the eggs were missing On July 28 we found to our sorrow that all the nests had been destroyed at least so we surmised as we did not find any young birds On May 31 1908 we visited the island again and found to our surprise that the colony was nesting fully five weeks earlier than in the preceding spring On this date we found eight nests seven on the island proper and one on the sandJuly 1912 NOTES ON WADING BIRDS OF BARR LAKE REGION COLORADO 125 bar leading to it from the shore as the water was now very low The seven were typical nests built in the zone of pigweed and young cockleburrs exactly like those of the preceding year while the one on the sandbar was a neat depres sion in the sand well lined with grass There was not a particle of vegetation or cover on the sandbar but on account of their coloration the eggs were very in conspicuous even in their exposed position On this occasion the birds were very noisy and demonstrative and we located the nests readily by their actions On June 14 we found that two of the nests had been destroyed some bird having pecked small holes in the eggs All the other nests had either hatched or been destroyed as we did not find either nest or young On June 19 we found another nest of four eggs on the island but still no sign of young birds and on June 27 this nest was found to have been destroyed as the others had been We finally concluded that the mischief must have been done by a goodsized flock of nonbreeding Ringbilled Gulls which made the island their headquarters The birds remained until the latter part of October well into the hunting season and their large size conspicuous coloration and absolute lack of fear of firearms made them easy prey for the thoughtless hunters who frequented the lakes Gallinago delicata WILSON SNIPE Up to very recent years the published records of Wilson Snipe as a breeding bird of Colorado were confined to four records that of Drew who found it breeding in San Juan County B N O C Iv 1881 85  that of W E D Scott who found it breeding at Twin Lakes Lake County at 9000 feet B N O C Iv 1879 92 and that of Aiken at the San Luis Lakes at 7500 feet elevation and that of Sprague Cooke at 9000 feet in the Middle Park All of these records are Transition and Canadian zone records and the first two at least are of such an indefinite nature that it is a question whether nests were actually found or whether the breeding record was based only upon the presence of the birds dur ing the nesting season From 1905 to 1909 Fred M Dille found several nests near Altoona Boulder County close to the foothills and at an elevation of about 5500 feet As these sets were taken just inside the Transition zone the single nest which we found at Barr June 20 1908 is so far as I know the first breeding record for the species within the Upper Sonoran zone of Colorado This peculiar bird occurs regularly though not commonly at Barr through out the nesting season and the fact that more nests have not been found may no doubt be attributed alone to lack of field work In fact we encountered several pairs of birds which we were reasonably sure were nesting but we were suc cessful in one instance only This nest was located on and above the surface of slightly damp ground at the edge of a good sized area of very soft boggy land formed by the seepage under the dike of the Big Barr Lake It was built in the center of a tussock of grass about eight inches in length and was a very neat well shaped and cupped nest composed entirely of fine dry grass In construction it was far superior to any shore birds nest I have ever seen being so compactly and strongly put to gether that it was possible to remove it from the nesting site without injury In general appearance the nest itself is not unlike certain sparrows nests It was not particularly well concealed in fact from above it was quite con spicuous The bird flushed when we were about fifteen feet away and made quite126 THE CONDOR Vol XIV a demonstration Of the four eggs one was quite fresh and the other three were in various stages of incubation On several occasions we noted the peculiar nuptial gyrations in the air which have been graphically described by some writers REMARKS UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF SEVERAL SPECIES OF LIMICOLAE W W Cooke in the Third Supplement to the Birds of Colorado Auk xxvI 1909 411 in speaking of the Western Solitary Sandpiper says The early publications on Colorado Ornithology included this species among the breed ing birds of the state and the same reference has been continued by subsequent writers As neither eggs nor young birds have ever been reported from the state the assumption of breeding rests on the presence of the birds in pairs during the summer season Late investigations have shown that many nonbreeding Solitary Fig 52 NEST AND EGGS OF WILSON SNIPE Sandpipers remain through the summer far south of the breeding grounds and also that the southward migration of breeding birds begins soon after the first of July In the light of these facts it must be considered that though the species probably does breed in Colorado yet the actual breeding is not yet proven While this statement was written over a year after the last of our work at Barr it confirmed our observations so thoroughly and applied so well to several species beside the one it referred to that it has been copied verbatim The most puzzling problem which confronted us was the status of the several species of Sandpipers and other waders whose breeding ground Was generally supposed to be in the far north which yet were quite common at Barr during at least a portion of the breeding season The closest attention was givei these species and much time was spent in an effort to definitely establish some of them as breeders yetJuly 1912 NOTES ON WADING BIRDS OF BARR LAKE REGION COLORADO 127 in only one instance lid we encounter any birds whose actions gave us any reason to believe that they were actually nesting This was a Least Sandpiper which was seen on a small stretch of sandy beach on May 24 1907 and a week later May 30 the same bird presumably was seen at the same place and exhibited some excitement at our intrusion The bird was very tame and even when frightened refused to leave the vicinity of the supposed nesting site However the most minute search failed to reveal a nest As we were unsuccessful in making any definite discoveries the actual dates will be given leaving the reader to form his own opinions

July 21 and 28 1907 and April 20 May 3 10 and June 19 1908 Throughout this list of dates a remarkable similarity of movement appears to exist the last three weeks of June being the only ones during the entire breed ing season that most of the above species were not seen It is also significant Fig 54 TYPICAL NEST OF KILLDEER that the five species which were seen during this period namely Least Sand piper Marbled Godwit both Yellowlegs and Western Willet are the species most likely to be found breeding in this locality Generally speaking the month of June appears to be the month during which all these species are least in evi dence and a decided influx of the birds is seen soon after the first of July In short the dates here given bear out Prof Cookes theory almost to the letter Bartramia longicauda UPLAND PLOVER Cooke in his Birds of Colorado states that the Bartramian Sandpiper breeds abundantly upon the plains The word abundarnt is at best a relative word yet during ten years field work the one nest we found near Barr was the only one I have ever seen nor have I heard of any other Colorado field workers who have actually taken the eggs and so far as I am aware there are no definiteJuly 1912 NOTES ON WADING BIRDS OF BARR LAKE REGION COLORADO 129 published breeding records for the state except that of Cooke Although there is small doubt that the bird breeds sparingly on the plains east of Denver it can hardly be called common anywhere in Colorado For these reasons description of this nest may be of value The nest which was found June 28 1907 was located in the midst of a rather thick tuft of sand grass blue stem and other dryland grasses on open rolling prairie well covered with grass weeds etc and fully two miles from any body of water It was on the west side of a small knoll on rather high ground and was built in an inconspicuous spot No evidence of it could be seen fifteen paces away The nest was a rather deep depression in the ground sparingly lined with fine weed stems grasses and a few bits of manure and one or two small feathers Fig 55 YOUNG KILLDEERS JUST OUT OF EGG The tops of the eggs were about flush with the surface of the ground The eggs were not all arranged with the points turned in toward the center When the nest was first found the bird flushed at a distance of about fifteen yards and its cries as it rose in the air brought three other birds within a few minutes At no time did the birds come anywhere near us and as soon as we left the nest they flew back to it from a point about a quarter mile distant On the second visit the parent left the nest when we were fully thirty yards away and flew off close to the ground with short rapid wingbeats similar to the flight of a Spotted Sand piper and lit about a hundred yards away While flying it continually uttered a querulous musical whistle Not long afterward either this bird or the other parent flew up to a height of fully one hundred yards and circled about us two or130 THE CONDOR Vol XI three hundred yards distant occasionally giving this same whistle Only once or twice did we hear the full Upland Plover song On June 14 1908 we located a pair of plover that undoubtedly had a nest not far from the shore of the lake but several careful searches were unsuccessful This pair of birds was most demonstrative on July 4 and 5 On July 11 their actions plainly indicated that young ones were near at hand Oxyechus vociferus KILLDEER The first sound that greeted us in the morning and the last thing we heard at night was the dreary monotonous cry of the Killdeer and even in the dead of night their notes were occasionally heard The birds were encountered every where on the lake shores in the marshes and often back on the dry prairie They arrived about the middle of March March 10 1907 is my earliest Fig 56 KILLDEER AND FOUR EGGS BURIED BY BURYING BEETLES AFTER PARENT HAD DIED ON EGGS date and by the middle of April were abundant Quoting from my notes of April 26 1907 The Killdeer have evidently begun nesting as we did not see onetenth as many around the lakes as we did last week April 21  but they are common in isolated pairs farther back on dry land We found two broken eggs on the lake shore and one on the dry prairie The earliest nest was found May 10 and the eggs hatched May 16 The bulk of the nests were found during the latter half of May but nests with eggs were found throughout the month of June One young of the year was seen July 28 which was unable to fly at that late date Mr Hersey was fortunate enough to see one set of eggs hatch He says the parent birds carried every bit of shell away from the nest within two hours after the hatching The birds actions when about the nest were always confusing and we did not flush the parent fromJuly 1912 NOTES ON WADING BIRDS OF BARR LAKE REGION COLORADO 131 the nest in a single instance For the most part they remained at a distance call ing loudly and only in one instance did I see a parent simulate a broken wing to lure the intruder away from the nest We found one brood of four young which had just hatched and had not left the nest They are beautiful little striped creatures and become very quick and active almost as soon as they are dry They run with surprising speed and the note even of the tiniest chicks is the exact counterpart of the parents note on a smaller scale The nests if they could be called such showed little variation except as to location but we found them equally common in damp marshy loca tions although in all such cases the nesting sites were perfectly dry and out amid the cactus and rabbit brush of the dry prairie The parent of one nest which we had under observation died upon her nest and during the week between our visits a colony of Burying Beetles buried eggs and parent until only the tip of the tail and one wing showed above the surface of the ground The birds began to gather in flocks the last week in July but did not depart for the south until late in October

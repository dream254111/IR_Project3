it divers times in the pleasantest season of the year and communicated to the Publisher by one of his Parisian Correspondents En glishd as followeth You have reason Sir to demand of me an account of the Lake of Geneva which in my opinion about this season of the year in June is one of the most pleasant places of the world This is the third time I have visited it and I am if I may say so more charmed with it than the first I shall say nothing of the Alpes nor of mount Jura which do envi ron it which by this Lake as by a large Ditch are separated from one another for that would not give you a sufficiently fair idea of the Country Be pleased therefore to represent unto your self a Croissant of water one extremity where of is eighteen leagues distant from the other and the banks of which are gently raised to some hights then to collines and at length to stupendious mountains which yet are not so linked to one another but that they leave betwixt them interstices of fifteen or twenty leagues prospects checkered by medows cornfields orchards vines Forests of Firtrees Snow lying on the sides of the Rocks All these objects which at a distance are confounded and seem to make but one have near hand their several beauties So well is the Country intersected by Rivolets which after they have served to make Iron Paper  c run into the Lake carrying with them very many fountains But leaving these things I shall now content my self to entertain your Curiosity by giving you a candid relation of what I have there observed in the space of four months Although I have told you that this Lake hath the figure of a Crois sant yet that point where is Geneva is somewhat longer and more ex tended than the other This Croissant where tis largest which is from Morges to Thonon is about five good leagues over That which hinders from making an exact estimate of its largeness in other places is that the Winds by driving the water toward the banks have made certain points which advance far into the Lake in such fort that when one happens to be opposite to the other the Lake seems to be narrow As may be observed in going from Geneva to Nion where it seems as if the Pharus or Watch tower of Prangin which is in Suisse did almost touch Savoy whereas yet one is a league distant from the other And what is remarquable is that at the coming out of this Straight the Lake hath there almost its greatest breadth and depth The water of this Lake is very good to drink and ever so limpid that even in the roling of the waves which sometimes go high enough the water is not troubled but along the banks And if one do attentive ly look down from the Castle of Chilon or from any of the neighbour ing hights into in the hottom of the Lake he may see high mountains E e e e e under5044 under the water And the water is so deep before Veuvay that the founding line at the end of four hundred fathoms seemsbecause it will not stayto touch upon something slipperyTis beld to be 500 fathoms deep before Roole and tis affirmed that near this great depth there may be seen a kind of Isle under water The Rhone enters at one of the points of the Croissant into the Lake and issueth out at the other but with this difference that whereas he comes in dirty and miryhe ever goes out so pure and clearthat under the bridge of Geneva where the water is deep twenty five feet in sum meryou may well discern the smallest stones at the bottom And the same waterwhich in this place appears of a Saphyrin blew in the shade of the Housesappears altogether green nor is so transparentwhen the Sun shines on it There is a great diversity of opinions as to the Current of the Rhone in the Lake some maintaining that it may be discerned others de nying itHaving heard the sentiments of the Curious of Lausanne and Genevaand the opinions of the most knowing Fishermen that are there in great number and especially at Coupet I believe with the latter Thatalthough the Rhone entring into the Lake looseth its violence yet doth he still keep some sensible motion in some places and every where observable and that no Trouts are taken any where in this Lake but in this Current of the Rhone which is what these Fishermen call to go and fish sur le mont Others there arethat go further and saythat one may every where distinguish the water of the Lake from that of the Rhone But the Fishermen will not allow this but assert that there is no other mark thanthose lately alledged viz of the Trouts and the Current and that the latter of these is alone sufficient in calm weather to observe the Current of the Rhone from the place of his entring the Lake unto that of his going out The water of this Lake commonly begins to increase about the end of Jannuaryor the beginning of Februaryand continues to do so unto the twentieth of Julyand often unto the very month of August and then it insensibly decreaseth so that the water is less high in winter than summer by 12 or 15 feet the frosts draining the Springs or ra ther freezing the waters that issue out of them About this Increase of the water there are also different opinions Tis truethey all believe in generalthat the principal cause of the in crease of the water is the melting of the Snow and of the mountanous Icethat is in the winter formed of the waters of the Springs and Tor rentswhich the frost fixeth This is so true that when there is much snow in winter the waters are very high the ensuing Summer But when great Rains chance to fall in Januarythen the Snow not yet be ing well hardned melteth on a sudden altogether And when this melting is not so violentall the Snowthat will melt melts at the end of5045 of May or at the beginning of June so that there remaining but the stock of Ice for entertaining the increase of the water unto the month of August some have thence been induced to say that this increase which amounts as hath been said to 15 feet water generally all over the Lakeis caused by the herbsgrowingas they pretendat its bottom in great abundance and that these herbs whilst growing do force the water upwardsand dying in autumn make the water to sink lower Which is not satisfactory to mebecause there are no herbs seen upon the Lake and very little within it and the banks being very dry Others there arethat will have this water rarified by the heat of the Sunand thereupon swelled on the bordershot water not being so high in the middle as cold This is certain that all the rivers and torrents that fall into this Lakecarry with them store of stones and earth which may indeed en large and raise it But such an augmentation or rise cannot be sen sible but from age to age not to mention that in winter whilst the water is lowthe stones of the Lake are carried away for building or fortifying at Geneva At the issuing out of the barresthat forme Genevaon the side of the Lakeare seen in the water two orthree hugeFlintsstanding out of the water the chief of which they call Niton And the tradition is that it formerly was an Altar consecrated to Neptune there being also a place cut out in middlewhich they take to have been the place for the sacrifice On this Flint seven or eight persons can sit and some timeswhen the waters are very low there are found about it knives and needles as thick as bodkins of tweeses and much longer both of brasswell enough made and esteemed to have served for the sacrifices This Lake in serene and calm weather appears sometimes and that even besore Sunrisingas if it were made of divers pieces differently coloured part of it being browner than the rest which seems to be caused by a breath of wind passing thorow the water coming either from the bottom of the Lakeor from above though others think this gentle agitation to proceed from some springs that are at the bottom making the water shiver aboveBut that part of the water that is not moved appears as even and smooth as a lookingglass or like water traced by a ship And as for the Colors they are in my opinion an ef fect of the neighbouring mountainsthe different images of which be ing confounded in the watermake an appearance of very pale colours After that the Rhone is entred into the Lake he retakes not his im petuous course before a quarter of a miles distance from its coming forth againthat isabove Geneva And the nearer he comes to that Townthe more his bed becoms narrow and consequently his course more rapid Yet this rapidness hath been in our times once surmoun ted by windand once by waterTo understand which you may ima E e e e e 2 gine5046 ginethat in Geneva there is a streak of Land about an hundred fathoms long which divides the Rhone into two parts passing under four bridges then coverd with houses From the point of this Isle unto se veral ranks of stakes on the side of the Town there are about a thou sand common paces This whole space of water which makes the fi gure of an V whereof the Isle is the point and the Town formes the sides and the stakesthe empty place of the end hath been once laid dry by a violent wind after this manner One day in the winter of the Year 1645 there arose in the morning about 9 a clock so furious a wind that not only it uncovered the houses but also laid dry the bed of the Rhone above the bridgesso that manyin the view of all the towncrossed quite over it dryfoot and one of the sons of M D Au bigny took up some medalswhich he found in his wayThis passage was free during an hours time at the end of which the Rivers retook its course At that season the water being very lowand a westwind to arrive at Genevebeing pressed by the high mountains that bring it up on the town as by the nose of a pair of bellows it came to pass that that wind did violently bear upon the water near the said bars keeping suspended the water that was beyondand those watersthat were be neathrunning away downwards by a declivity and under the shelter of the housesWhilst I was scrupling at this relation they brought me Gallasius his Commentary upon Exodusprinted 1560 where tis re cordedthat the like accident had faln out at Geneva at the time when that Minister lived therea Southwest wind having made the Rhone to recoile into the Lakeand many people having thereupon passed o ver dry for an hours time Concerning the other accident you may remember that the river Arve which is a kind of Torrent falls into the Rhone about a 1000 paces beneath Geneva In the month of December in the Year 2652 the said Arve did so extraordinarily swell that not only it over run its banks with impetuositybut also interrupted the course of the Rhone and forced it to reenter into the Lake for the space of fourteen hours though some do esteem that the Arve disgorged it self for that time into the Lakeby passing over the water of the Rhone whichin their opinion continued his course under the water of the Arve However the water was seen at Geneva to reenter into the Lake But to concludethis Lake doth very much abound in Fish but that which is observable is that those Fishes have as twere cantonized themselvesand divided the Lake amongst them The Trouts are not to be found therebut as hath been already mentioned in the Current of the Rhone the Carps have taken up their quarter towards Veuvay the Pikes d Pearches have also their habitations apart But some other fishthat are but passengers not living constantly in the Lake spread themselves almost every where indifferently The5047 The great Trouts pass out of the Lake for four months of the Sum mer and are taken in autumn when they are returning thither The Fishing is farmed out at Geneva and there are Conservatories where many of those big Trouts are kept among which there are some that weigh fifty pounds Sometimes they catch Pikes there of eighty pounds weight and a pound weight at Geneva you know to be eighteen ounces In the months of July and August they fish there for the Fry of Pearches at a time when they are no bigger than the smallest taggs These are a very delicious dish there called Mille Cantons I shall add no more than put you in mind of that Duke of Savoy who renounced his Crown and the Pontificat it self to pass deliciou sly the rest of his dayes at Ripailles where he made so good cheer to all that visited him that to express a very merry entertainment they say still faire Ripailles

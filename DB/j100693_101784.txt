COLOURS PUBLISHED BY THAT EMINENT NATURALIST THE HONOURABLE ROBERT BOYLE IN THE YEAR 1662 OUR AUTHOR TELLS US THAT HAVING OFTEN CONSIDERED WITH HIMSELF THIS PROBLEM WHETHER OR NO AMONG SO GREAT A VARIETY OF SIMPLE BODIES METALS AND VEGETABLES THERE WERE NOT SOME SPECIES THAT WOULD WHEN DISTILLED RETAIN THEIR OWN NATIVE COLOURS HE HATH FOUND THAT SOME OF THEM WOULD DO THIS OF WHICH HE HATH SET

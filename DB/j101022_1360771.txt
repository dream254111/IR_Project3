j101022,Bulletin of the Cooper Ornithological Club,1360771,Echoes from the Field,i259081,BULLETIN OF THE COOPER ORNITHOLOGICAL CLUB when within fifty yards of the fence the larger one of the two swooped down at the rabbit and when he dodged the Eagle pursued him flying at a height of about three feet above the ground The rabbit redoubled his speed and made straight for the fence the Eagle following and both doing their best the one fleeing for his life the other pursuing to satisfy the cravings of an empty stomach This unequal race was kept up un til the fence was reached the Eagle having gained until she was but two or three feet behind the rabbit When the rabbit passed through the fence I expected to see the Eagle give up the pursuit but she had no intention of doing so for without slacking her speed she raised herself just enough to clear the fence and dropping down behind the rabbit continued as before Still I thought that he had a good chance to escape for he had gained a little ground in passing through the fence but in stead of dodging around through the trees which is something the rabbit al ways does when pursued by dogs he was so crazed with fear that he ran in a straight line down through the or chard The velocity with which the Eagle flew at this stage of the chase was something wonderful Fast as the rab bit ran the great black shadow be hind him drew nearer and nearer un til poising an instant over its victim the Eagle pounced upon him A short struggle a cry or two from the rabbit and all was still I hastily ran toward the spot and had approached nearly to the Eagle when it took wing and joined its mate which was wheeling around above me After a few turns they mounted up into the heavens and in a short time disappeared The rabbit was a large Jack and was in a perfectly healthy condition A row of deep gashes on either side of the backbone marked the spot where the Eagle had struck him with its tal ons and his head was almost severed from the body the throat being cut al most as cleanly as could have been done with a knife The gash extended from the jaw bone on one side of the neck to the ear on the other Echoes from the Field The OldSquaw and Fulvous Tree Ducks at Alviso Cal During the first week in February of this year I received from Alviso in this Santa Clara county a specimen of the Longtailed Duck or OldSquaw a female in winter plumage So far as I know this is the first instance of this species being taken in this county nor am I aware that it has ever been reported from any point on San Francisco Bay I have seen at the house of a friend in San Jose a Fulvous Tree Duck also taken at Alviso several years ago I believe that this species has not been re corded from this county before and is at any rate a rare visitor here F H HOLMES Berryessa Cal April 15 1899 A Record for Los Angeles County Cal I have to report an addition to Mr Grinnells List of Birds of the Pacific Slope of Los Angeles Co having tak en four males and two females of Loxia curvirostra minor They were working on the cones of pines along Lincoln Ave Pasadena and when disturbed by the report of a gun were readily recalled by imitating the note of the fe male Different members of the Club have looked sharply for this Crossbill among the pines on Wilsons Peak during the past few years without suc cess but now the dry year and consequent lack of food brings them to our very door F S DAGGETT Pasadena Cal Dec 26 I898 Unusual Lining of a Red Bellied Hawks Nest and Sonoma County Notes On April 14 I899 I secured a set Y3 Redbellied Hawk and was surprised to notice a nest of the Californian Bush Tit used as part of the lining of the hawks nest It was torn open about four inches from the bottom and as the shells of several eggs 5iBULLETIN OF THE COOPER ORNITHOLOGICAL CLUB were stuck to the feathers inside the Bush Tits nest must have been taken from the tree by the hawks and torn open afterward On April 7 the hawks nest held two eggs but the Bush Tits nest was not then a part of the lining During the winter of I896 I saw what I supposed was a Mountain Bluebird but not until last winter was I positive that S arctica could be placed on my list of Sonoma Co birds On December 8 I saw two and they were commou in Jan uary and February and several were seen on March 9 They remained in large open fields and seemed to find plenty of food as a male shot on Jan I8 was in fine condition In the MarchApril BULLETIN Mr Slevin speaks of seeing some Swallows at Point Reyes on Dec 31 which he took to be the Violetgreen I think the birds were Tree Swallows as I have never seen the Violetgreen until late in February while the Tree Swallow has been noted every month in the year In winter they can often be seen flying about some warm springs along the foothills at the edge of the marsh off San Pablo Bay HENRY W CARRIGER Sonoma Cal April i6 1899 Eastern Junco and Whitethroated Sparrow in California I have the pleas ure to record the capture of three specimens of Junco hyemalis in California The first a male I took at Battle Creek on October 23 I898 The other two were found at St Helena a male on the first of last February and a female three days later Through the kindness of Mr W E Bryant I may record four specimens of Zonotrichia albicollis for this state One was taken at Los Angeles Feb 25 1807 and is mounted in Mr Bryants collection Three taken at Santa Rosa now belong to me Dates of two are Oct 13 i898 and Nov 23 I898 The third one has not yet been forwarded to me There appears to be no difference between these and eastern specimens of Z albicollis RICHARD C MCGREGOR Palo Alto Cal Notes from Alameda Cal WESTERN BLUEBIRD For the last seven or eight years I have not met this never common bird as formerly On frequent trips through the county and Contra Costa County in spring I have noticed from three to ten on each trip during the past five years and at times saw none at all It is a sparse breeder in Alameda County An acquaintance of mine took a set of eggs in this town about fifteen years ago The last Dwarf Hermit Thrush was seen rather heard April 6 a few miles from here It was unusually common this winter One made itself at home about my woodshed and became quite tame eating grubs and bore worms when I was splitting wood Western Robins were very scarce up to January In February they were quite abundant singing freely I heard one singing in December One Varied Thrush noted April I2 they have nearly all departed now Ob served the first one on Sept 27 A few Western Goldencrowned Kinglets wintered here in the live oaks and evergreens I observed them occasionally from October to March The Ruby crowns were common as usual this winter but not gregarious like the Golden crowns On Sept 27 I heard the call notes of a Russetbacked Thrush and although the bird remained hidden I knew I was not deceived by its indistinguishable voice The late date is commentable Nuthatches are rarely observed any year Perhaps they do not occur at all some years in this immediate locality They were often seen this winter A Redbreastedwas the first one seen Aug 30 Took one Sept 5 and one Oct Io and a Slenderbilled Nov Ii The last birds seen were in the middle of Feb ruary All the birds ever seen here were seen within a radius of 300 yards 52BULLETIN OF THE COOPER ORNITHOLOGICAL CLUB I have observed the Western Winter Wren here only several times Took one Oct 6 Plain Titmice are fast disappearing and are growing quite uncommon Fur ther back in the hills is where civilization has driven them Young were found in two nests April 8 The American Pipit in winter appears to be as much at home in town as the urban English Sparrow After a rain they can be found singly or in small bunches along the pavements in the densest part of town looking for worms Took a  California Creeper Jan 14 making the first one I ever saw in the county Parkmans and Vigors Wrens are seen almost the year around Last winter 18978 a Parkmans remained about my garden and the winter before last 18967 a Vigors wintered near by Neither species passed this winter here In January I took a 8 Tule Wren from the salt marsh near here Several of the crown feathers and one wing primary secondary were pure white Peculiar Eggs of California Shrike and Other Notes In the San Joaquin Valley about twentyeight miles southeast of Stockton on May 23 I898 I found two nests of the California Shrike in a grove of locusts near the road both containing eggs partly incubated One egg in the set of four is pure white with a faint greenish tint marked at the larger end with a black scrawl and over the surface are a few obscure specks of light brown The other three are typical specimens although one is lightly marked The set  of two also contains an almost un marked specimen On June 15 1897 near Soquel Santa Cruz Co Cal I took a nest of the West ern Wood Pewee containing three fresh eggs On examining the nest after reaching camp I was surprised to find two more eggs beneath the lining in which the contents were partly dried They differ much in size and color from the other eggs and do not seem to have been laid by the same individuals MILTON S RAY San Francisco Cal Notes from Marin and San Benito Counties Cal In BULLETIN No 2 are some in teresting notes from different sections of the state concerning the appearance of birds unusual in the localities mentioned It strikes me that it would be bene ficial to the students of ornithology if such notes were supplemented by additional ones from persons who have been in position to make observations upon the species mentioned in different localities at corresponding dates as this would as sist very materially in studying distribution and habits Accordingly I will en deavor to make a start in this line by adding my notes to those of the last issue REDBREASTED NUTHATCH Sitla canadensis Mr Otto Emerson speaks of these birds having appeared in Alameda Co in September i898 and mentions their occurrence in Marin County At that time they were very abundant here the first having been observed on Aug 29 when two or three were seen A few days later they were very numerous frequenting almost altogether at this time the fir and cypress trees on the ranges In October they became less abundant and toward the middle of the month were found feeding among the live oak trees even in the valley near the house By Nov I they had all disappeared This bird has never to my knowledge been recorded in Marin Co before I saw a few in San Mateo on Nov 6 LEwis WOODPECKER Melanerpes torquatus These birds breed to a greater or less extent seemingly depending upon the season at Paicines San Benito Co Cal where we have taken several sets On the first of last October a large num ber of immigrants must have come in as they were far more numerous than those breeding there would account for by natural increase My brother and I collect ed a beautiful series at this time of birds of the year in different plumages some of which were exceedingly interesting 53BULLETIN OF THE COOPER ORNITHOLOGICAL CLUB AMNERICAN CROSSBILL Loria curviroslra mzinor At times these birds pass through Marin Co in numbers stopping for a short while to feed often on the Tojon berries As they are very shy and generally frequent the tops of the tall Douglas firs on the higher ranges they are difficult to obtain but specimens have leen taken on two occasions by C A Allen Some years elapse without any le ing observed but this does not prove that they have not been here as their us ual feeding grounds are seldom visited by any observer WESTERN EVENING GROSBEAK Coccothrausfcs v montants On October 14 1898 a  of this species was shot near Point Reyes Station Marin Co and sent to me Their occurrence in this county has been reported to ime before but as 1no specimens had been taken the reports were not verified MYRTLE WVARBIER lendroica coronaa This bird is miuch more common in California than most people have been led to suppose There are a nulmber in our collection from Marin and San 13enito counties thouglh we have only collect ed thenl casually I have seen a good many that lave not been taken and find that at close range they can be sufficiently recoonized by the sulerloral and pos tocular streaks to enable one to be moderately accurate in icldentification That is to say if a person were to shoot all that he saw with this characteristic he would find the majority of his birds to be corionaa SEX OF VINTEiR RESIDENTS It would be interesting to hear fromi different lo calities in regard to which sex prelomlinates in solme of the winter residents For instance here at San Geronimo nearly every Redbreasted Sapsucker Spbyrapi cus rzbecr taken is a  especially so in miidwinter All of the Rubycrowned Kinglets Rcgluus calcndula taken here have been males Almost all of thle lwarf Hermit Thrushes fJlocichzla aonlischkI also have been males only three that I know of having proved to be females one of these being a partial albino We have several Thickbilled Sparrows taken here at different times and all   These last are present some winters but not all How are the birds above men tioned in other localities JOSEPhI MAILLIARD San Geronimo Cal An Account of the Takiiig of Four Sets of only in four cases

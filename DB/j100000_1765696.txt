waters from te Yellowstone National Park is not without interest to the medical profession and to tlle public at large The waters collected by experts employed by the Geo logical Survey have been most carefully examined by Dr F A Gooch now professor of chemistry at Yale College and Mr J Edward Whitfield of the survey laboratory and represent the latest and best methols of svateranalsis The analyses of these waters are of particular interest be cause the great varietf of mineral springs found in the Yellowstone attracting the attention of a11 visitors to that region suggests their use as remedial agents in the cure of disease Aside from the wellknown resorts of the Virginias there are but few places in the United States where natural hot waters are thus utilized The hotsprings of Arkalasas

less useful than the sulphurous svaters in such cases At present no waters of this character are utilized for baths but could be readily led into suitable bathhouses at the Norris Basin This locality is indeed the best suited for a sanitarium of any of the geyser basins of the nark as all the varieties of waters occur here save the calcareous Sulphurous waters are verr familiar though those of the Yellowstone are particularly strong The Mammoth Hot Spring waters tough smeling strongly of sulphur at the vent possess little if any of that important constituent when led into baths for it is all deposited about the vents alld upon the algae growing in the waters but excellent ex amples of this type are found at the Norris Basin as well as elsewhere in the parE Now that the roads atld hotel accommodations in the park are so good and the region so easily reached in Pullman coaches and with diningcars it is to be hoped that the waters of these springs may bring relief to manv sufferers

to be high time that some one having authority sllould reaci tbe riot act to a numEer of American meteorologists The views latel  ads anced bs Dr Hann that cyclones excepting those of tropical regions hase their origill ratherinthegreatgen eral tnovements of the upper atrnospilere than in the ascensional movement of relatively warln and moist air and the consequent zapor condensation may or may not stancl the test of a more ex tensise and critical series of temperature studies than those made in 1889 but it is none the less incumbent upon American meteor ologists to treat with proper courtesy the conscientious and life long labors of a fellowcountryman an3 it is but scant cOUltesy to exhibit to the vworld an eagerness to drag into pronlinence and accept seriously a new theory of eyclonic genesis z hen such a theory lacks in ever way extensize and careful stus1y and is really but little more than a mere possibilit suggested bv an eminent foleign metearologist svhen he found in certain tem perature obsersations a somewllat marked difference from tllose whith the accepted theory seemed to hiln to require There may be  thermicand there may bedynamic cyclones hut the observations should be numerous and trustworthy before it is claimed that auch a distinction e2rists and before we seri ously accept the very radical vievr that temperatures in cyclones are determinel by tle motions of the air A tllorough series of 37 temperature determinations at different parts of the storm as a mechanism is needed and should be offered Especially is this demanded when the acceptance of the new view implies a partiaI remodellirg at least of a theory that is of long standina and has the sanction of one of the best equipped minds of the many that have tackled meteorological problems Should occasion require Professor Ferrel can doubtless successfully defelli the  iews he holds but for the benefit of some who may not be aware of his metods of work it may be not out of place to say here that nothing from his hand is the result of haste but on the contraryt the result of mature thought and patient careful deliberate stlldy of the best scientific information at his comreand With all possible deference to Dr Hanns eminence in matters meteorological it is to be questioned whether a series of tempera ture observations at some follrteen stations sesren of which have an altitude of over tvvo thollsand metres for only two storms the barometric maximum of Nov 1224 and the minimum of Oct 1 prosze any thirwg after all but that it is quite possible to find tem peratures higher than tlje nornlal when lower ones might be e2 pectes But this abnormality is but a slinl support for a new theory nor does it disprove the old The air in the h lh area late in November was apparelltly warmer than the air in the  low  at the beginning of October but that does not prove that tlle mean tenlperature of the air in any and every maxima is alwags higher than the mean temperature of any and every extratropical minima it is conceded that the new theorNz vviJl not hold fortropical storms Dr Hann claims that seven of these alpine stations llase all ele vation over two kilometres above sealevel Yet it may be ar open question if these heights give the condstions which he sought more palticuarly if we lemember that certain of the 3irr clouds certainly have an elevation of not less than eighty kilome tres and a twokilometre temperature observation may give hut an uncertain irdication We can even finl at surface stations abnoranalities that if misinterpreted might lead us to doubt a great many of our accepte3 sTiews in the matter of atmospheric ternperature Mr Kingston director of tlle roronto Observatory in 1868 called attention to the fant tal the twelteyear normals 184152 were not applicahle to observations of Jater years anl according to five year normals it was easy to shozv that January was warme1 than February etc anl Schott shows in a table how from 1841 to 1850 February wls colder than Janllary at New Eaen Toronto Philadelphia Sharleston and Savannah while from 1851 to 1860 the reverse holds true It is tlerefores it seems to me only fair to insist tllat Anerican lnetecrologists demand full smd most thorollgh evidence before seriously considering the uestion of nlodifyillg present theories more particularly too vhen an unintentional but none tlle less real disposition exists in certain quarters to speak carelessly of Professor Ferrel and his wtork and to deny him his proper place Not a bad exalnple of tllis carelessness aFpeals in a translation ly E F Balllber in the lhilosop7zica1 Mclgazine for December 1890 of Werner on Siemenss vievs on a general system of winds of the earth The eminent pll sicist in refuting the state ment of Dr Sprung in a recent paper in the Meteorologische Zeit schrift that he atterupted like FeXrrel to found on theoretical calculations a theoly of the general system of winds on the earth disclaims in all mo3esty a sufficient proficiellcy in tle higher mathematics to do this but then imrnediately aclds it appears to U8 sonlewhat illogically tllat he 4 considers this method alto gether inapuropriate He therefore replldiates the charge that  he sought like Ferrel to demonstrate by mean3 of calculation an original state of atmospheric motion in order to aftervwards base his further speculations thereon 2 There is no intentional intimation here we take it that Ferrels vieses ale leased on a supposition more or less hasty and uncertain and there is there fore little occasion for the rejoinder that any Isuch intimation in dicates 7z lack of familiarity with Ferrel 8 work but it ought to be felt and recognized especially by Americall meteorologists that experimental fact rests at the lottonl of eserv natulal law 1 See Schotts Tables p 199 2 Sitzungsberichte d S Prouss Akad d Wiss su Berlin 1890 SCIENCE

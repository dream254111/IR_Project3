PART OF A LETTER FROM THE REVEREND MR HUGH JONES TO THE REVEREND DR BENJAMIN WOOD ROOFE F R S CONCERNING SEVERAL OBSERVABLES IN MARYLAND HONOURED SIR AS FOR THIS COUNTRY WHICH YOU DESIRE ME TO SEND YOU AN ACCOUNT OF THE FOLLOWING PARTICULARS I HOPE WILL GIVE YOU AN IDEA THEREOF AND OF OUR WAY OF LIVING CHESEPEAKBAY WHICH RUNS NORTH AND BY WEST ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILES OR MORE DIVIDES THIS PROVINCE AS WELL AS VIRGINIA INTO TWO PARTS WHICH WE CALL THE EASTERN AND WESTERN SHORES THE WHOLE PROVINCE CONTAINS ELEVEN COUNTIES SIX ON OUR SIDE WHICH IS THE WESTERN AND FIVE ON THE EASTERN SHORE THE LAND IS GENERALLY LOW ON BOTH SIDES NO HILL THAT I HAVE SEEN OR HEARD OF AMONG THE INHABITANTS FIFTY YARDS PERPENDICULAR BUT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILES BACK OR WEST OF US TOWARDS THE HEADS OF RIVERS THE GROUND RISES AND APPEARS IN VERY HIGH MOUNTAINS AND ROCKY PRECIPICES RUNNING NORTH AND SOUTH FROM THE TOP OF WHICH A MAN MAY HAVE A CLEAR PROSPECT OF VIRGINIA AND MARYLAND ALL THE LOW LAND IS VERY WOODY LIKE ONE CONTINUED FORREST NO PART CLEAR BUT WHAT IS CLEARED BY THE ENGLISH AND THO WE ARE PRETTY CLOSELY SEATED YET WE CANNOT SEE OUR NEXT NEIGHBOURS HOUSE FOR TREES INDEED IN FEW YEARS WE MAY EXPECT IT OTHERWISE FOR THE TOBACCOTRADE DE STROYS ABUNDANCE OF TIMBER BOTH FOR MAKING OF HOGSHEADS AND BUILDING OF TOBACCOHOUSES BESIDES CLEARING OF GROUND YEARLY FOR PLANTING OUR SOIL IS GENERALLY SANDY FREE FROM STONE WHICH MAKES IT VERY437 VERY CONVENIENT FOR TRAVELLING AND WE HAVE NO OC CASION FOR SHOOING OUR HORSES EXCEPT IN FROSTY WEA THER AND WHAT WITH THE GOODNESS OF OUR LITTLE HORSES AND THE SMOOTHNESS OF THE ROADS WE CAN TRA VEL UPON OCCASION FIFTY MILES IN A SUMMERS AFTERNOON AND SOMETIMES A HUNDRED MILES IN A DAY INDEED OUR MILES ARE NOT COUNTED SO LONG AS IN ENGLAND AS FOR THE NATURAL SITUATION OF THE COUNTRY THE NUMBER OF NAVIGABLE RIVERS CREEKS INLETS RENDER IT SO CON VENIENT FOR EXPORTING AND IMPORTING GOODS INTO ANY PART THEREOF BY WATER CARRIAGE THAT NO COUNTRY CAN COMPARE WITH IT THE RICH AND PLENTIFUL GIFTS OF NA TURE LIKEWISE ADD TO THE HAPPINESS OF THE PLACE THE THREE ELEMENTS AFFORDING PLENTY OF FOOD FOR THE USE OF MAN VIZ DEER FOWLE BOTH WATER AND LAND IN A BUNDANCE AND FOR THE PRESERVING OF HEALTH MANY EX CELLENT HERBS AND ROOTS THE DISCOVERY OF WHOSE VER TUES WE OWE CHIEFLY TO THE INDIANS AS FOR THE NATURAL PRODUCT OF THE COUNTRY WE HAVE FOR TIMBER SEVERAL SORTS OF OAK VIZ THE RED WHITE BLACK CHESNUT WATER SPANISH AND LINE OAKS WHICH LAST BEARS A LEAF LIKE A WILLOW WE HAVE CEDAR WHITE AND RED THE RED SERVES ONLY FOR POSTS AND GROUNDSILS THE WHITE TO RIVE OR SPLIT INTO BOARDS THAT BEING THE FREEST FROM KNOTS AND GOES UNDER THE NAME OF CYPRESS BUT I THINK FALSLY HERE IS A TREE WE CALL CYPRESS WHICH IS EXTRAOR DINARY LARGE IN BULK AND BEARS A LEAF LIKE THE SENSI TIVE PLANT IT IS SOFT AND SPUNGY WILL NOT RIVE AND IS FIT FOR NO USE WE HAVE BLACK WALLNUT WHICH IS MIGHTILY ESTEEMED BY THE JOYNERS FOR ITS GRAIN AND COLOUR HERE IS A SORT OF POPLAR THAT MAKES GOOD WHITE PLANK IT IS A LARGE TREE AND BEARS A FLOWER LIKE A TULIP WE HAVE ALSO PLENTY OF PINE AND DOGWOOD WHICH IS A FINE FLOWERBEARINGTREE SAS SAFRAS438 SAFRAS LOCUST A TREE OF VERY QUICK GROWTH AND VE RY DURABLE IN BUILDING HICKERY OF WHICH HE HAVE TWO SORTS RED AND WHITE THIS SERVES CHIEFLY FOR FIRE WOOD BEING THE BEST FOR THAT USE WE HAVE ALSO PLENTY OF CHESNUTS AND CHINQUAPINE ANOTHER SPECIES OF CHESNUT AND A SORT OF ELM LIKE A DUTCH ELM WHICH WE CALL THE SUGARTREE FROM THE SWEETNESS OF ITS JUICE WITH WHICH SOME HAVE MADE GOOD SUGAR HERE IS ALSO A SORT OF ELDER WHOSE BARK IS CLOSELY GUARDED WITH PRICKLES LIKE THOSE OF A BRIAR TULIPBEARING LAUREL AND MYRTLE OF SEVERAL SORTS ONE WHEREOF BEARS A BERRY WITH WHICH THEY MAKE IN THE EASTERN SHORE GREEN WAX VERY PROPER TO MAKE CANDLES IF MIXED WITH TALLOW AMONG THE INHABITANTS OF THE AIR WHICH ARE VE RY NUMEROUS THE HUMBING BIRD IS THE MOST CURI OUS THEY CONTINUE WITH US ALL SUMMER FEEDING ON LY UPON FLOWERS LIKE BEES THE MOCKING BIRD FOR VARIOUS NOTES EXCEEDS ALL THE BIRDS I BELIEVE IN THE WORLD BUT IT IS HARD TO RAISE ONE BY REASON OF THE HARDNESS OF THE WINTER THAT KILLS THEM IN THEIR CAGES IT IS A VERY TENDER BIRD AND REQUIRES A GREAT DEAL OF ATTENDANCE AND THE SEAMEN WILL NOT GIVE IT THEM ELSE I HAD SENT YOUR SON ONE BEFORE NOW PURSUANT TO HIS REQUEST OF ALL OUR REPTILES THE RATTLESNAKE IS THE MOST NOTED AND WHAT IS COMMONLY REPORTED OF ITS CHARMING BIRDS AND SQUIRRELS C IS NOT GROUNDLESS FOR IT HATH BEEN AFFIRMED TO ME BY SEVERAL EYE WITNES SES AS FOR THE NATURE OF THE CLIME THE AIR IS NOW MORE WHOLESOME THAN FORMERLY WHICH I SUPPOSE PRO CEEDS FROM THE OPENING OF THE COUNTRY THAT GIVING THE AIR A FREER MOTION OUR SUMMERS ARE NOT EXTREME HOT AS IN THE FIRST SEATING AND OUR WINTERS ARE GENERALLY SEVERE TOWARDS WHAT THEY ARE IN ENGLAND THE NORTH WEST WIND IS VERY SHARP IN WINTER AND EVEN IN THE HEAT439 INFERREDHEATINFERRED OF SUMMER IT MIGHTILY COOLS THE AIR AND TOO OFTEN AT THAT TIME A SUDDEN NORTHWESTERN STRIKES OUR LABOURERS INTO A FEVER WHEN THEY ARE NOT CAREFUL TO PROVIDE FOR IT AND PUT ON THEIR GARMENTS WHILE THEY ARE AT WORK WE HAVE LITTLE OR NO WOOLLEN OR LINNEN MANUFACTURE FOLLOWED BY ANY OF US EXCEPT WHAT IS DONE IN SOMERSET COUNTY OVER THE BAY BECAUSE WE ARE YEARLY SUPPLIED FROM ENGLAND WITH NECESSARIES BUT TOBACCO IS OUR MEAT DRINK CLOATHING AND MONIES NOT BUT THAT WE HAVE MONEY BOTH SPANISH AND ENGLISH PRETTY PLENTY WHICH SERVES ONLY FOR POCKET EXPENCES AND NOT FOR TRADE TOBACCO BEING THE STANDARD FOR TRADE NOT ONLY WITH THE MERCHANTS BUT ALSO AMONG OUR SELVES IT WERE TOO TEDIOUS TO RELATE THE WAY AND MANNER OF MAKING TOBACCO WHICH IS A COMMODITY SO VENDIBLE ESPECIALLY THESE LAST SEVEN YEARS PAST THAT THOUSANDS HAVE GOT GOOD ESTATES BY IT MOST OF OUR PLANTERS WHEN THEY BEGAN THIS SORT OF HUSBANDRY HAD NOT WHERE WITHAL TO CLOATH THEMSELVES WHEREOF SEVERAL NOW ARE WORTH THOUSANDS OF POUNDS INDEED THIS COUNTRY HATH BEEN CHIEFLY SEATED BY POOR PEOPLE WHOSE INDUSTRY INFERREDHATHINFERRED RAISED THEM TO GREAT ESTATES OUR COMMON DRINK IS SYDER WHICH IS VERY GOOD AND WHERE IT IS RIGHTLY ORDERRED NOT INFERIOR TO THE BEST WHITEWINE WE HAVE WINE BROUGHT US FROM MADERA AND FAYAL RUM FROM BARBADOES BEER MAULT AND WINES FROM ENG LAND WE HAVE PLENTY OF GOOD GRAPES GROWING WILD INFERREDININFERRED THE WOODS BUT THERE IS NO IMPROVEMENT MADE OF THEM AND NOW SIR TO TOUCH A LITTLE UPON THAT WHICH CHIEFLY UNDER GOD ADVANCES OUR WELFARE VIZ OUR GOVERNMENT WE ARE GOVERNED BY THE SAME LAWS AS INFERREDININFERRED ENGLAND ONLY SOME ACTS OF ASSEMBLY WE HAVE RE LATING TO SOME PARTICULAR CASES NOT UNDER THE VERGE OF THE ENGLISH LAWS OR WHERE THE LAWS OF ENGLAND DO X X X NOT440 NOT SO APTLY PROVIDE FOR SOME CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH OUR WAY OF LIVING HATH PUT US THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND GOD BE PRAISED IS PRETTY FIRMLY ESTABLISHED AMONG US CHURCHES ARE BUILT AND THERE IS AN ANNUAL STIPEND ALLOWD TO EVERY MINISTER BY A PERPETUAL LAW WHICH IS MORE OR LESS ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF TAXABLES IN EACH PARISH EVERY CHRI STIAN MALE ABOVE SIXTEEN YEARS OLD AND NEGROES MALE AND FEMALE ABOVE THAT AGE PAY FORTY POUND OF TO BACCO TO THE MINISTER WHICH IS LEVIED BY THE SHERIFF AMONG OTHER PUBLICK LEVIES WHICH MAKES THE RE VENUES OF THE MINISTERS ONE WITH ANOTHER ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND POUND OF TOBACCO OR ONE HUNDRED POUND STERLING PER ANN IT HATH BEEN THE UNHAPPINESS OF THIS COUNTRY THAT THEY HAVE HAD NO PROTESTANT MINI STERS HARDLY AMONG THEM TILL GOVERNOUR NICHOLSONS TIME WHO HAS BEEN A GREAT PROMOTER AND ENCOURAGER OF THE CLERGY BUT NOW AND THEN AN ITINERANT PREACHER OF VERY LOOSE MORALS AND SCANDALOUS BEHAVIOUR SO THAT WHAT WITH SUCH MENS ILL EXAMPLES THE ROMAN PRIESTS CUNNING AND THE QUAKERS BIGOTRY RELIGION WAS IN A MANNER TURNED OUT OF DOORS BUT GOD BE PRAISED THINGS NOW STAND BETTER AND OUR CHURCHES ARE CROWDED AS FULL AS THEY CAN HOLD AND THE PEOPLE ARE PRETTY SEN SIBLE OF THE ROMAN SUPERSTITION AND THE QUAKERS MADNESS SO THAT THEIR PARTIES BOTH JOYNED TOGE GETHER ARE VERY INCONSIDERABLE TO WHAT OURS IS INDEED THE QUAKERS STRUGGLE HARD TO MAINTAIN THEIR FOOTING AND THEIR TEACHERS ESPECIALLY THE FEMALE SEX WHO ARE THE MOST ZEALOUS ARE VERY FREE OF THEIR TAUNTS AND CON TUMELIES AGAINST US BUT IT IS TO LITTLE PURPOSE UNLESS TO MAKE THEIR OWN WAY MORE RIDICULOUS AND ODIOUS AS FOR OUR PART I THINK WE TAKE THE MOST EFFECTUAL ME THOD UNDER GOD TO STOP THEIR SPREADING VIZ BY NOT MINDING THEM FOR I BELIEVE THAT TO OPPOSE A HERESIE BY DISPUTES441 DISPUTES AND DECLAMATIONS IS THE READY WAY TO INCREASE IT AND I FIND THE MORE THEY CONDEMN OUR CHURCH RAIL AND SCOFF AT THE CLERGY THE FEWER PROSELYTES THEY GAIN AND I DO NOT DOUBT IF IT PLEASE GOD BUT IN FEW YEARS THE CHURCH WILL HAVE NOT MANY TO OPPOSE IT ESPECIALLY OF QUAKERS WE HAVE NOT YET FOUND THE WAY OF ASSOCIATING OUR SELVES IN TOWNS AND CORPORA TIONS BY REASON OF THE FEWNESS OF HANDICRAFTSMEN AND WE HAVE NO TRADE AT HOME OR ABROAD BUT THAT OF TOBACCO THERE ARE INDEED SEVERAL PLACES ALLOTTED FOR TOWNS BUT HITHERTO THEY ARE ONLY TITULAR ONES EXCEPT ANNAPOLIS WHERE THE GOVERNOUR RESIDES GO VERNOUR NICHOLSON HATH DONE HIS ENDEAVOUR TO MAKE A TOWN OF THAT THERE ARE IN IT ABOUT FORTY DWELLING HOUSES SEVEN OR EIGHT WHEREOF CAN AFFORD GOOD LODGING AND ACCOMMODATIONS FOR STRANGERS THERE IS ALSO A STATEHOUSE AND A FREESCHOOL BUILT WITH BRICK WHICH MAKE A GREAT SHEW AMONG A PARCEL OF WOODEN HOUSES AND THE FOUNDATION OF A CHURCH LAID THE ONLY BRICK CHURCH IN MARYLAND THEY HAVE TWO MARKETDAYS IN THE WEEK AND HAD GOVERNOUR NICHOL SON CONTINUED THERE SOME YEARS LONGER HE HAD BROUGHT IT TO SOME PERFECTION AS FOR OUR PREDECESSORS THE INDIANS I CANNOT GIVE YOU AT PRESENT ANY FURTHER ACCOUNT OF THEM THAN THIS VIZ THAT WHEREAS AT THE FIRST SEATING OF MARYLAND THERE WERE SEVERAL NATIONS OF INDIANS IN THE COUNTRY GO VERNED BY SEVERAL PETTY KINGS NOW I DO NOT THINK THAT THERE ARE FIVE HUNDRED FIGHTING MEN OF THEM IN THE PROVINCE AND THOSE ARE MOST ON THE EASTERN SHORE WHERE THEY HAVE TWO OR THREE LITTLE TOWNS SOME OF THEM COME OVER TO OUR SIDE IN WINTER TIME TO HUNT FOR DEAR BEING GENERALLY EMPLOYED BY THE ENGLISH THEY TAKE DELIGHT IN NOTHING ELSE AND IT IS RARE THAT ANY OF THEM WILL IMBRACE OUR WAY OF LIVING OR WORSHIP X X X 2 THE442 THE CAUSE OF THEIR DIMINISHING PROCEEDED NOT FROM ANY WARS WITH THE ENGLISH FOR WE HAVE HAD NONE WITH THEM BUT FROM THEIR OWN PERPETUAL DISCORDS AND WARS AMONG THEMSELVES AS BEING A SCATTERED PEOPLE UNDER SEVERAL HEADS AND ALWAYS AT VARIANCE ONE WITH ANOTHER THE FEMALE SEX ALSO HAVE SWEPT AWAY A GREAT MANY SO THAT NOW THEY AREDWINDLED ALMOST TO NOTHING ONE THING IS OBSERVABLE IN THEM THO THEY ARE A PEOPLE VERY TIMOROUS AND COWARDLY IN FIGHT YET WHEN TAKEN PRISONERS AND CONDEMNED THEYL DYE LIKE HEROES BRAVING THE MOST EXQUISITE TORTURES THAT CAN BE INVENTED AND SINGING ALL THE TIME THEY ARE UPON THE RACK NOW SIR LEST I SHOULD TRESPASS TOO MUCH UPON YOUR PATIENCE I WILL PUT A STOP TO THIS IMPERFECT AND DESULTORY DISCOURSE HOPING YOU WILL GENEROUSLY PAR DON ALL THE FAULTS AND MISTAKES OF SIR TOUR MUCH OBLIGED AND VERY HUMBLE SERVANT HUGH JONES MARYLAND JAN 23 1698 AN

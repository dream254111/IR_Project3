imagination any more than one is always thinking of the training of observation in studying natural sciences or of reasoning in studying mathematics The object is to learn all there is to be learned on each subject But the selection and proportion of studies should be determined with a view to the training of both imagination and understand ing Even so teachers are more important than curriculum Students that have been intellectually quickened say that they are indebted to this or that professor oftener than they say that they owe all to particular studies The man at the other end of the bench and not the book in his hand President Garfield rightly esteemed a liberal education at Williamstown Should you succeed in broadening deepening and vitalizing education so that the real and the ideal meet together so that understanding and imagination kiss each other following gener ations will be none the less practical and all the more happy and noble The second address was made by Rev Huber Gray Buehler Master in English at the Hotchkiss School on THE TRAINING OF THE IMAGINATION IN THE STUDY OF LITERATURE MR HUBER GRAY BUEHLER There is of course no call for a discussion in this presence of the question whether the study of literature lends itself to the training of the imagina tion The poet is confessedly of imagination all compact his imaginative endowment is shared by the novelist the dram atist the orator and the historian and the reader who guided by the printed word understands and follows the creations of these imaginative spirits who rises to the height of their thought and feeling and who participates in their soulattitudes must do so by means of his own imagination which is thereby exercised and trained The practical question before us is one of pro cedure In our discussion we are concerned not that we shall try to train the imagination through literature but that our try ing shall amount to somethingTHEi SCHOOL REtVI EW But before approaching this question of procedure it may be well to remind ourselves that the activity of the imagination is not limited to the creation of images of things seen We speak of  the eye of the imagination or  the minds eye as if the faculty in question had to do only with objects of sight The imagina tion certainly has an eye as when blind Milton wrote To confirm his words out flew Millions of flaming swords  the sudden blaze Far round illumined Hell The eye from the nature of the case is more likely to receive general and adequate cultivation than any other organ of sensa tion and therefore visual images drawn by the imagination from the sense of sight are the most likely to be sharp and vivid But it must not be forgotten that if the imagination has an eye it has also an ear as when Tennyson says  The trumpet blared At the barrier like a wild horn in a land Of echoes and a moment and once more The trumpet and again at which the storm Of galloping hoofs bare on the ridge of spears And riders front to front until they closed In conflict with the crash of shivering points And thunder It has also a tongue to taste with as when Keats tells us that Prospero From the closet brought a heap Of candied apple quince and plum and gourd With jellies soother than the creamy curd And lucent syrups tinct with cinnamon And it has a nose to smell with as when Milton speaks of the odorous breath of morn and Shakespeare tells of gloves as sweet as damask roses Finally imagination makes use of sensations of touch as when Keats says that on St Agnes Eve  The owl for all his feathers was acold Such products of the imagination derived from the senses of hearing taste touch and smell do much to  deceive the burthen 7IoN E ASSOCIA TION OF COLLEGES AND PREPARA TOR Y SCHOOLS 7I of life The person whose faculty for forming them is weak does not have his imagination normally developed To imagine only those things that appeal to the sense of sight is to resem ble a paralytic who has lost control over all his limbs but one Therefore we should see to it that our pupils can recall the sound of a rivulet as easily as its appearance and instantly call up at the summons of imagination the taste of its water the touch of its mossy bank and the odor of the flowers growing near Only when the pupil can do this is he capable of enjoying literature to the utmost Take for example the following lines from Lowell We sit in the warm shade and feel right well How the sap creeps up and the blossoms swell We may shut our eyes but we cannot help knowing That skies are clear and grass is growing The breeze comes whispering in our ear That dandelions are blossoming near That maize has sprouted that streams are flowing That the river is bluer than the sky That the robin is plastering his house hard by And if the breeze kept the good news back For other couriers we should not lack We could guess it all by yon heifers lowing And hark how clear bold chanticleer Warmed with the new wine of the year Tells all in his lusty crowing Touch sound sight taste are all there and odor appears a few lines below when the poet speaks of the sulphurous rifts of passion and woe But I pass on to the question of procedure How shall we train the imagination by means of literature  The subject naturally divides itself into a consideration I of the choice of material and 2 of method With regard to the choice of material there is fortunately pretty general agreement Pub lishers have put within reach of all schools an immense mass of literature that by common consent is well adapted to the needs of education In selecting from this material only two cautions seem worthy of our attention The first is that the7HE SCHOOL REVIEW literature chosen for study should not employ visual images only School reading books should be full of sound and odor taste and feeling as well as of vision so that when the pupil wakes to the new life which literature opens to him he may exclaim like Christopher Sly I see I hear I speak I smell sweet savours and I feel soft things The other caution to be observed in selecting literature to stir and feed the imagination of youth is that care should be taken to choose pieces whose imageswhether visual or not are in some sense founded on and related to the readers experi ence An example of a different choice is found I think in the selection some years ago of the Fourth Canto of Byrons Childe Harold  as a requirement for admission to one of our great colleges The beauty and power of that bit of literature are unquestioned but it consists of a series of poetical comments on objects that for the most part are familiar only to those who have traveled in Italy and read Italian literature and the poets imagination playing with these far distant objects requires for the interpretation of its images an experience outside the lives of most students The images are not within the reach and comprehension of all men but are intelligible only to a select few who through travel and previous reading have received a special training for the enjoyment of the poem Just as a per son who has never seen a hill or mountain can scarcely imagine the charm to the eye and the excitement to the mind which Alpine scenery imparts so the ordinary American boy can make little of  Childe Harold until photographs or the stereopticon supplemented by some cramming of history have put him in pos session of the materials with which Byrons imagination worked But when the question of selection has been answered the ques tion of method remains Supposing that the books for study have been wisely chosen how shall we get hold of the pupils imagination and make it follow the flight of the authors mind  With some pupils perhaps little method is called for Give them the books to read and their imagination will take care of itself 7 2N E ASSOCIA TION OF COLLEGES AND PREPARA TORY SCHOOLS 713 Little pedagogical help is needed for instance by such boys as Barries Sentimental Tommy or a little neighbor of mine whose imagination is so audaciously active that he recently told his mother he had had such a good time playing whist with God But not all children are thus gifted With many the imagina tion is dull and sluggish and needs to be stirred aroused stimu lated led How shall we do this How shall we make such pupils see with the authors eyes hear with his ears feel with his touch  The common danger is that reading only with the bodily eyes they will see only the printed words not the ideas which they represent and thus will walk through the galleries of the poets mind without stopping to see the pictures hung there How shall we prevent this  I suggest two methods of procedure The first belongs to the early stages of literature work and deals only with the visual imagination It is to encourage or if you will require pupils to express in art forms that which they are reading about By expressing it in art forms I mean draw ing it with crayon colors or pencil modeling it in sand or clay or making it with knife and hammer The principle underlying this suggestion is that before mental images can be expressed with crayon clay or tools they must become definite and clear A boy can talk about what he sees dimly and vaguely he can draw or model only what he sees clearly Require him to express his vague image in tangible form and he will discover its imper fections and go back to his author with greater interest and wide open eyes Working under this method children who are reading  Robinson Crusoe  will perhaps make the famous island out of sand At first it will be desolate and uninhabited but when the shipwreck is reached Crusoe will appear perhaps as a little tin figure After building his hut and leading for a while his solitary life he will be joined by Friday and so on to the end of the island life Boys reading the Iliad in English will construct Homeric weapons and draw Homeric scenes In a New York school children who are reading Hiawatha construct forest and wigwams in a corner of the schoolroom which is reservedTHE SCHOOL REVIEW for the purpose and people these with the characters in the poem to whom they nod in friendly recognition when they read aloud about them In another school of my acquaintance a class of girls who were beginning Miltons Comus were recently told to draw something they had read about in the lesson Two girls sketched the drear wood another chose one of Comuss transformed monsters another caught the expression Stygian darkness and illustrated it with a drawing of the river Styx another could picture nothing but Neptunes trident The other method of procedure belongs to all stages of the study of literature and has to do with images of sound touch taste and smell as well as of sight It is simply the method of judicious questioning The aim of this questioning should be to lay bare the images in the pupils mind in order that if these be vague or incorrect they may be made vivid and true Some times the revelations are startling The other day in answer to the question  What are ambrosial locks   a pupil said sweet smelling locks whereupon another pupil remarked with disgust that for her part she hated hair oil Regarding the kind of ques tions to be asked the material is so multitudinous and varied that it is difficult to make definite suggestions and perhaps this is not necessary Mastery of the art of questioning may be taken for granted among successful teachers Therefore I sim ply remark that experience has led us to adopt the plan of having some questions printed and put in the hands of pupils when the lesson is assigned The advantage of this plan is that it stimulates mental activity while the lesson is preparing gives the pupil time to think brings him to the class room in a recep tive mood and by relieving the recitation period of much ques tioning and waiting for answers increases the opportunity for real instruction These two methodsexpression in forms of art and wise questioning  must be our main reliance in training dull imagina tions through the study of literature But before I close it may be worth while to say that we have found the stereopticon to be 7I4N E ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND PREPARA TORY SCHOOLS 715 a most useful auxiliary in the teaching of literature Passing by the obvious and more common uses of the lantern I mention two that bear directly on the education of the imaging power The first is the employment of the stereopticon to furnish the student with the materials used by the authors imagination Boys take a keen interest in Irvings Alhambra after they have heard an illustrated talk on the  Red Castle itself they grasp the incidents and characters of the Lady of the Lake much more firmly after they have viewed on the screen the scenery of the Scottish lakes Addisons and Irvings papers on Westminster Abbey have for them meaning and beauty only after they have seen pictures of the famous church and its tombs George Eliots Romola gains immensely when the stereopticon has made Florence a real city to the mind of the boy The second way in which the lantern can be used in the training of the imagination is after a class has read such litera ture as the Sir Roger de Coverley papers or The Ancient Mari ner to throw on the screen Hugh Thomsons illustrations of the former and Dores illustrations of the latter and then invite the class to compare their own imaginings formed from the reading of the text with those of the illustrators Never yet have I found a class that did not infinitely prefer the word pictures of Addison and Coleridge and criticise intelligently the interpretations by Dore and Thomson Such are a few suggestions on a vast subject In conclusion let it be said that our success in arousing interest in literature and love for it will be commensurate with our success in arous ing the imagination of our pupils Great authors dwell with an absorbed and controlling enthusiasm in a world of images which their imagination summons or creates and love of reading is little else than passion for this same imageworld Before our pupils can feel this passion they must know that world

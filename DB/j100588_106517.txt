J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,106517,AN ACCOUNT OF THE GANGES AND BURRAMPOOTER RIVERS BY JAMES RENNELL ESQ F R S COMMUNICATED BY JOSEPH BANKS ESQ P R S,I206936,87 IX AN ACCOUNT OF THE GANGES AND BURRAMPOOTER RIVERS BY JAMES RENNELL ESQ F R S COMMUNICATED BY JOSEPH BANKS ESQ P R S READ JANUARY 25 1781 THE  GANGES AND  BURRAMPOOTER RIVERS TOGETHER WITH THEIR NUMEROUS BRANCHES AND ADJUNCTS INTERFECT THE COUNTRY OF BENGAL IN SUCH A VARIETY OF DIRECTIONS AS TO FORM THE MOST COMPLEAT AND EASY INLAND NAVIGATION THAT CAN BE CON CEIVED SO EQUALLY AND ADMIRABLY DIFFUSED ARE THOSE NATURAL CANALS OVER A COUNTRY THAT APPROACHES NEARLY TO A PERFECT PLANE THAT AFTER EXCEPTING THE LANDS CONTIGUOUS TO BURDWAN BIR BOOM C WHICH ALTOGETHER DO NOT CONSTITUTE A SIXTH PART OF BENGAL WE MAY FAIRLY PRONOUNCE THAT EVERY OTHER PART OF THE COUNTRY HAS EVEN IN THE DRY SEASON SOME NAVIGABLE STREAM WITHIN 25 MILES AT FARTHEST AND MORE COMMONLY WITHIN A THIRD PART OF THAT DISTANCE IT IS SUPPOSED THAT THIS INLAND NAVIGATION GIVES CONSTANT EM PLOYMENT TO 30000 BOATMEN NOR WILL IT BE WONDERED AT WHEN IT IS KNOWN THAT ALL THE SALT AND A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE  THE PROPER NAME OF THIS RIVER IN THE LANGUAGE OF HINDOOSTAN OR INDOSTAN IS PUDDA OR PADDA IT IS ALSO NAMED BURRAGONGA OR THE GREAT RIVER AND GONGA THE RIVER BY WAY OF EMINENCE AND FROM THIS DOUBTLESS THE EUROPEAN NAMES OF THE RIVER ARE DERIVED  THE ORTHOGRAPHY OF THIS WORD AS GIVEN HERE IS ACCORDING TO THE COMMON PRONUNCIATION IN BENGAL BUT IT IS SAID TO BE WRITTEN IN THE SANSCRIT LANGUAGE BRAHMAPOOTAR WHICH SIGNIFIES THE SON F BRAHMA 6 FOOD88 MR RENNELLS ACCOUNT OF THE FOOD CONSUMED BY TEN MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE CONVEYED BY WATER WITHIN THE KINGDOM OF BENGAL AND ITS DEPENDENCIES TO THESE MUST BE ADDED THE TRANSPORT OF THE COMMERCIAL EXPORTS AND IM PORTS PROBABLY TO THE AMOUNT OF TWO MILLIONS STERLING PER ANNUM THE INTERCHANGE OF MANUFACTURES AND PRODUCTS THROUGH OUT THE WHOLE COUNTRY THE FISHERIES AND THE ARTICLE OF TRA VELLING  THESE RIVERS WHICH A LATE INGENIOUS GENTLEMAN APTLY TERMED SISTERS AND RIVALS HE MIGHT HAVE SAID TWIN SISTERS FROM THE CON TIGUITY OF THEIR SPRINGS EXACTLY RESEMBLE EACH OTHER IN LENGTH OF COURSE IN BULK UNTIL THEY APPROACH THE SEA IN THE SMOOTH NESS AND COLOUR OF THEIR WATERS IN THE APPEARANCE OF THEIR BORDERS AND ISLANDS AND FINALLY IN THE HEIGHT TO WHICH THEIR FLOODS RISE WITH THE PERIODICAL RAINS OF THE TWO THE BURRAM POOTER IS THE LARGEST BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS NOT OBVIOUS TO THE EYE THEY ARE NOW WELL KNOWN TO DERIVE THEIR SOURCES FROM THE VAST MOUNTAINS OF THIBET  FROM WHENCE THEY PROCEED IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS THE GANGES SEEKING THE PLAINS OF HIN DOOSTAN OR INDOSTAN BY THE WEST AND THE BURRAMPOOTER BY THE EAST BOTH PURSUING THE EARLY PART OF THEIR COURSE THROUGH RUGGED VALLIES AND DEFILES AND SELDOM VISITING THE HABITATIONS OF MEN THE GANGES AFTER WANDERING ABOUT 750 MILES THROUGH THESE MOUNTAINOUS REGIONS ISSUES FORTH A DEITY TO THE SUPERSTI  THE EMBARKATIONS MADE USE OF VARY IN BULK FROM 180 TONS DOWN TO THE SIZE OF A WHERRY THOSE FROM 30 TO 50 TONS ARE RECKONED THE MOST ELIGIBLE FOR TRANSPORTING MERCHANDIZE  THESE ARE AMONGST THE HIGHEST OF THE MOUNTAINS OF THE OLD HEMISPHERE I WAS NOT ABLE TO DETERMINE THEIR HEIGHT BUT IT MAY IN SOME MEASURE BE GUESSED BY THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF THEIR RISING CONSIDERABLY ABOVE THE HORIZON WHEN VIEWED FROM THE PLAINS OF BENGAL AT THE DISTANCE OF 150 MILES 7 TIOUSGANGES AND BURRAMPOOTER RIVERS 89 TIOUS YET GLADDENED INHABITANT OF HINDOOSTAN  FROM HURD WAR OR HURDOAR IN LATITUDE 30 WHERE IT GUSHES THROUGH AN OPENING IN THE MOUNTAINS IT FLOWS WITH A SMOOTH NAVIGABLE STREAM THROUGH DELIGHTFUL PLAINS DURING THE REMAINDER OF ITS COURSE TO THE SEA WHICH IS ABOUT 1350 MILES DIFFUSING PLENTY IMMEDIATELY BY MEANS OF ITS LIVING PRODUCTIONS AND SECONDA RILY BY ENRICHING THE ADJACENT LANDS AND AFFORDING AN EASY MEANS OF TRANSPORT FOR THE PRODUCTIONS OF ITS BORDERS IN A MILITARY VIEW IT OPENS A COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT POSTS AND SERVES IN THE CAPACITY OF A MILITARY WAY THROUGH THE COUNTRY RENDERS UNNECESSARY THE FORMING OF MAGAZINES AND INFINITELY SURPASSES THE CELEBRATED INLAND NAVIGATION OF NORTH AMERICA WHERE THE CARRYING PLACES NOT ONLY OBSTRUCT THE PRO GRESS OF AN ARMY BUT ENABLE THE ADVERSARY TO DETERMINE HIS PLACE AND MODE OF ATTACK WITH CERTAINTY IN ITS COURSE THROUGH THE PLAINS IT RECEIVES ELEVEN RIVERS SOME OF WHICH ARE EQUAL TO THE RHINE AND NONE SMALLER THAN THE  THE FABULOUS ACCOUNT OF THE ORIGIN OF THE GANGES AS COMMUNICATED BY MY LEARNED AND INGENIOUS FRIEND C W BOUGHTON ROUSE ESQ IS THAT IT FLOWS OUT OF THE FOOT OF BESCHAN  FROM WHENCE SAY THE BRAMINS IT HAS ITS NAME PADDA THAT WORD SIGNIFYING FOOT IN THE SANSCRIT LANGUAGE AND THAT IN ITS COURSE TO THE PLAINS OF HINDOOSTAN IT PASSES THROUGH AN IMMENSE ROCK SHAPED LIKE A COWSHEAD THE ALLEGORY IS HIGHLY EXPRESSIVE OF THE VENERATION WHICH THE HINDOOS HAVE FOR THIS FAMOUS STREAM AND NO LESS SO OF THEIR GRATITUDE TO THE AUTHOR OF NATURE FOR BESTOWING IT FOR IT DESCRIBES THE BLESSING AS FLOWING PURELY FROM HIS BOUNTY AND GOODNESS THE ROCK BEFORE MENTIONED HAS I BELIEVE NEVER BEEN VISITED BY ANY EUROPEAN AND IS EVEN ALLOWED BY MOST OF THE NATIVES TO BEAR NO RESEMBLANCE TO THE OBJECT FROM WHENCE IT IS DENOMINATED HOWEVER AS THE EFFECTS OF SUPERSTITION DO OFTEN LONG SURVIVE THE ILLUSIONS THAT GAVE IT BIRTH THE ROCK OR CAVERN STILL PRESERVES THE NAME OF GOWMOOKY OR COWSHEAD  BESCHAN IS THE SAME WITH VISTNOU THE P R E S E R V I N G D E I T Y VOL LXXI N THAMES90 MR RENNELLS ACCOUNT OF THE THAMES BESIDES AS MANY OTHERS OF LESSER NOTE IT IS OWING TO THIS VAST INFLUX OF STREAMS THAT THE GANGES EXCEEDS THE NILE SO GREATLY IN POINT OF MAGNITUDE WHILST THE LATTER EXCEEDS IT IN LENGTH OF COURSE BY ONETHIRD INDEED THE GANGES IS INFERIOR IN THIS LAST RESPECT TO MANY OF THE NORTHERN RIVERS OF ASIA THOUGH I AM INCLINED TO THINK THAT IT DISCHARGES AS MUCH OR MORE WATER THAN ANY OF THEM BECAUSE THOSE RIVERS DO NOT LIE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE PERIODICAL RAINS  THE BED OF THE GANGES IS AS MAY BE SUPPOSED VERY UNEQUAL IN POINT OF WIDTH FROM ITS FIRST ARRIVAL IN THE PLAINS AT HURD  THE PROPORTIONAL LENGTHS OF COURSE OF SOME OF THE MOST NOTED RIVERS IN THE WORLD ARE SHEWN NEARLY BY THE FOLLOWING NUMBERS EUROPEAN RIVERS THAMES  1 RHINE  514 DANUBE  7 WOLGA  912 ASIATIC RIVERS INDUS  512 EUPHRATES  812 GANGES  912 BURRAMPOOTER  912 NOU KIAN OR AVA RIVER  912 JENNISEA  10 OBY  1012 AMOOR  11 LENA  1112 HOANHO OF CHINA  1312 KIAN KEU OF DITTO  1512 AFRICAN RIVER NILE  1212 AMERICAN RIVERS MISSISIPI  8 AMAZONS  1534 WARGANGES AND BURRAMPOOTER RIVERS 91 WAR TO THE CONFLUX OF THE JUMNAH THE FIRST RIVER OF NOTE THAT JOINS IT ITS BED IS GENERALLY FROM A MILE TO A MILE AND A QUARTER WIDE AND COMPARED WITH THE LATTER PART OF ITS COURSE TOLE RABLY STRAIGHT FROM HENCE DOWNWARD ITS COURSE BECOMES MORE WINDING AND ITS BED CONSEQUENTLY WIDER TILL HAVING ALTERNATELY RECEIVED THE WATERS OF THE GOGRA SOANE AND GUN DUCK BESIDES MANY SMALLER STREAMS ITS BED HAS ATTAINED ITS FULL WIDTH ALTHOUGH DURING THE REMAINING 600 MILES OF ITS COURSE IT RECEIVES MANY OTHER PRINCIPAL STREAMS WITHIN THIS SPACE IT IS IN THE NARROWEST PARTS OF ITS BED HALF A MILE WIDE AND IN THE WIDEST THREE MILES AND THAT IN PLACES WHERE NO ISLANDS INTERVENE THE STREAM WITHIN THIS BED IS ALWAYS EITHER INCREASING OR DECREASING ACCORDING TO THE SEASON WHEN AT ITS LOWEST WHICH HAPPENS IN APRIL THE PRINCIPAL CHANNEL VARIES FROM 400 YARDS TO A MILE AND A QUARTER BUT IS COMMONLY ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF A MILE THE GANGES IS FORDABLE IN SOME PLACES ABOVE THE CONFLUX OF THE JUMNAH BUT THE NAVIGATION IS NEVER INTERRUPTED BELOW THAT THE CHANNEL IS OF CONSIDERABLE DEPTH FOR THE ADDITIONAL STREAMS BRING A GREATER ACCESSION OF DEPTH THAN WIDTH AT 500 MILES FROM THE SEA THE CHANNEL IS THIRTY FEET DEEP WHEN THE RIVER IS AT ITS LOWEST AND IT CONTINUES AT LEAST THIS DEPTH TO THE SEA WHERE THE SUDDEN EXPANSION OF THE STREAM DEPRIVES IT OF THE FORCE NECESSARY TO SWEEP AWAY THE BARS OF SAND AND MUD THROWN ACROSS IT BY THE STRONG SOUTHERLY WINDS SO THAT THE PRINCIPAL BRANCH OF THE GANGES CANNOT BE ENTERED BY LARGE VESSELS ABOUT 220 MILES FROM THE SEA BUT 300 RECKONING THE WIND INGS OF THE RIVER COMMENCES THE HEAD OF THE DELTA OF THE GANGES WHICH IS CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN TWICE THE AREA OF THAT OF THE NILE THE TWO WESTERNMOST BRANCHES NAMED THE  THIS WILL BE EXPLAINED WHEN THE WINDINGS OF THE RIVER ARE TREATED OF N 2 COSSIMBUZAR92 MR RENNELLS ACCOUNT OF THE COSSIMBUZAR AND JELLINGHY RIVERS UNITE AND FORM WHAT IS AFTERWARDS NAMED THE HOOGLY RIVER WHICH IS THE PORT OF CALCUTTA AND THE ONLY BRANCH OF THE GANGES THAT IS COMMONLY NAVIGATED BY SHIPS THE COSSIMBUZAR RIVER IS ALMOST DRY FROM OCTOBER TO MAY AND THE JELLINGHY RIVER ALTHOUGH A STREAM RUNS IN IT THE WHOLE YEAR IS IN SOME YEARS UNNAVIGABLE DURING TWO OR THREE OF THE DRYEST MONTHS SO THAT THE ONLY SUBORDINATE BRANCH OF THE GANGES THAT IS AT ALL TIMES NAVIGA BLE IS THE CHUNDNAH RIVER WHICH SEPARATES AT MODDAPOUR AND TERMINATES IN THE HOORINGOTTA THAT PART OF THE DELTA BORDERING ON THE SEA IS COMPOSED OF A LABYRINTH OF RIVERS AND CREEKS ALL OF WHICH ARE SALT EXCEPT THOSE THAT IMMEDIATELY COMMUNICATE WITH THE PRINCIPAL ARM OF THE GANGES THIS TRACT KNOWN BY THE NAME OF THE WOODS OR SUNDERBUNDS IS IN EXTENT EQUAL TO THE PRINCIPALITY OF WALES AND IS SO COMPLETELY ENVELOPED IN WOODS AND IN FESTED WITH TYGERS THAT IF ANY ATTEMPTS HAVE EVER BEEN MADE TO CLEAR IT AS IS REPORTED THEY HAVE HITHERTO MISCARRIED ITS NUMEROUS CANALS ARE SO DISPOSED AS TO FORM A COMPLEAT INLAND NAVIGATION THROUGHOUT AND ACROSS THE LOWER PART OF THE DELTA WITHOUT EITHER THE DELAY OF GOING ROUND THE HEAD OF IT OR THE HAZARD OF PUTTING TO SEA HERE SALT IN QUANTITIES EQUAL TO THE WHOLE CONSUMPTION OF BENGAL AND ITS DEPENDENCIES IS MADE  THE HOOGLY RIVER OR WESTERNMOST BRANCH OF THE GANGES HAS A MUCH DEEPER OUTLET TO THE SEA THAN THE PRINCIPAL BRANCH PROBABLY THIS MAY BE OWING TO ITS PRECIPITATING A LESS QUANTITY OF MUD THAN THE OTHER THE QUANTITY OF THE GANGES WATER DISCHARGED HERE BEING LESS THAN IN THE OTHER IN THE PROPORTION OF ONE TO SIX FROM THE DIFFICULTIES THAT OCCUR IN NAVIGATING THE ENTRANCE OF THE HOOGLY RIVER MANY ARE LED TO SUPPOSE THAT THE CHANNELS ARE SHALLOW THE DIFFICULTIES HOWEVER ARISE FROM BRINGING THE SHIPS ACROSS SOME OF THE SANDBANKS WHICH PRO JECT SO FAR INTO THE SEA THAT THE CHANNELS BETWEEN THEM CANNOT EASILY BE TRACED FROM WITHOUT 4 ANDGANGES AND BURRAMPOOTER RIVERS 93 AND TRANSPORTED WITH EQUAL FACILITY AND HERE ALSO IS FOUND AN INEXHAUSTIBLE STORE OF TIMBER FOR BOATBUILDING THE BREADTH OF THE LOWER PART OF THIS DELTA IS UPWARDS OF 180 MILES TO WHICH IF WE ADD THAT OF THE TWO BRANCHES OF THE RIVER THAT BOUND IT WE SHALL HAVE ABOUT 200 MILES FOR THE DISTANCE TO WHICH THE GANGES EXPANDS ITS BRANCHES AT ITS JUNCTION WITH THE SEA IT HAS BEEN OBSERVED BEFORE THAT THE COURSE OF THIS RIVER FROM HURDWAR TO THE SEA IS THROUGH AN UNIFORM PLAIN OR AT LEAST WHAT APPEARS SUCH TO THE EYE FOR THE DECLIVITY IS MUCH TOO SMALL TO BE PERCEPTIBLE A SECTION OF THE GROUND PARALLEL TO ONE OF ITS BRANCHES IN LENGTH 60 MILES WAS TAKEN BY ORDER OF MR HASTINGS AND IT WAS FOUND TO HAVE ABOUT NINE INCHES DE SCENT IN EACH MILE RECKONING IN A STRAIGHT LINE AND ALLOWANCE BEING MADE FOR THE CURVATURE OF THE EARTH BUT THE WINDINGS OF THE RIVER WERE SO GREAT AS TO REDUCE THE DECLIVITY ON WHICH THE WATER RAN TO LESS THAN FOUR INCHES PER MILE AND BY A COM PARISON OF THE VELOCITY OF THE STREAM AT THE PLACE OF EXPERIMENT WITH THAT IN OTHER PLACES I HAVE NO REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT ITS GENERAL DESCENT EXCEEDS IT THE MEDIUM RATE OF MOTION OF THE GANGES IS LESS THAN THREE MILES AN HOUR IN THE DRY MONTHS IN THE WET SEASON AND DURING THE DRAINING OFF OF THE WATERS FROM THE INUNDATED LANDS THE CURRENT RUNS FROM FIVE TO SIX MILES AN HOUR BUT THERE ARE INSTANCES OF ITS RUNNING SEVEN AND EVEN EIGHT MILES IN PARTI CULAR SITUATIONS AND UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES I HAVE AN  M DE CONDAMINE FOUND THE DESCENT OF THE RIVER AMAZONS IN A STRAIGHT COURSE OF ABOUT 1860 MILES TO BE ABOUT 1020 ENGLISH FEET OR 613 INCHES IN A MILE IF WE ALLOW FOR THE WINDINGS IT COMES OUT NEARLY THE SAME AS THE GANGES WHICH WINDS ABOUT 119 MILE IN THREE TAKING ITS WHOLE COURSE THROUGH THE PLAINS NAMELY ABOUT 4 INCHES IN A MILE EXPERIMENT94 MR RENNELLS ACCOUNT OF THE EXPERIMENT OF MY OWN ON RECORD IN WHICH MY BOAT WAS CAR RIED 56 MILES IN EIGHT HOURS AND THAT AGAINST SO STRONG A WIND THAT THE BOAT HAD EVIDENTLY NO PROGRESSIVE MOTION THROUGH THE WATER WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT THE VELOCITY OF THE STREAM IS THREE MILES IN ONE SEASON AND FIVE OR MORE IN THE OTHER ON THE SAME DESCENT OF FOUR INCHES PER MILE AND THAT THE MOTION OF THE INUNDATION IS ONLY HALF A MILE PER HOUR ON A MUCH GREATER DESCENT NO FURTHER PROOF IS REQUIRED HOW SMALL THE PROPORTION OF VELOCITY IS THAT THE DESCENT COMMUNICATES IT IS THEN TO THE IMPETUS ORIGINATING AT THE SPRING HEAD OR AT THE PLACE WHERE ADVENTITIOUS WATERS ARE POURED IN AND SUCCESSIVELY COM MUNICATED TO EVERY PART OF THE STREAM THAT WE ARE PRINCIPALLY TO ATTRIBUTE THE VELOCITY WHICH IS GREATER OR LESSER ACCORDING TO THE QUANTITY OF WATER POURED IN IN COMMON THERE IS FOUND ON ONE SIDE OF THE RIVER AN ALMOST PERPENDICULAR BANK MORE OR LESS ELEVATED ABOVE THE STREAM ACCORDING TO THE SEASON AND WITH DEEP WATER NEAR IT AND ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE A BANK SHELVING AWAY SO GRADUALLY AS TO OCCA SION SHALLOW WATER AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE MARGIN THIS IS MORE PARTICULARLY THE CASE IN THE MOST WINDING PARTS OF THE RIVER BECAUSE THE VERY OPERATION OF WINDING PRODUCES THE STEEP AND SHELVING BANKS  FOR THE CURRENT IS ALWAYS STRONGEST ON THE EXTERNAL SIDE OF THE CURVE FORMED BY THE SERPENTINE COURSE OF THE RIVER AND ITS CONTINUAL ACTION ON THE BANKS  HENCE IT IS THAT THE SECTION OF A RIVER THAT WINDS THROUGH A LOOSE SOIL APPROACHES NEARLY TO AN OBTUSE ANGLEDTRIANGLE ONE OF WHOSE SIDES IS EXCEEDINGLY SHORT AND DISPROPORTIONED TO THE OTHER TWO  BUT WHEN A RIVER PERSEVERES IN A STRAIGHT COURSE THE SECTION BECOMES NEARLY THE HALF OF AN ELLIPSIS DIVIDED LONGITUDINALLY  EITHERGANGES AND BURRAMPOOTER RIVERS 95 EITHER UNDERMINES THEM  OR WASHES THEM DOWN IN PLACES WHERE THE CURRENT IS REMARKABLY RAPID OR THE SOIL UNCOM MONLY LOOSE SUCH TRACTS OF LAND ARE SWEPT AWAY IN THE COURSE OF ONE SEASON AS WOULD ASTONISH THOSE WHO HAVE NOT BEEN EYE WITNESSES TO THE MAGNITUDE AND FORCE OF THE MIGHTY STREAMS OCCASIONED BY THE PERIODICAL RAINS OF THE TROPICAL REGIONS THIS NECESSARILY PRODUCES A GRADUAL CHANGE IN THE COURSE OF THE RIVER WHAT IS LOST ON ONE SIDE BEING GAINED ON THE OTHER BY THE MERE OPERATION OF THE STREAM FOR THE FALLEN PIECES OF THE BANK DIS SOLVE QUICKLY INTO MUDDY SAND WHICH IS HURRIED AWAY BY THE CURRENT ALONG THE BORDER OF THE CHANNEL TO THE POINT FROM WHENCE THE RIVER TURNS OFF TO FORM THE NEXT REACH WHERE THE STREAM GROWING WEAK IT FINDS A RESTING PLACE AND HELPS TO FORM A SHELVING BANK WHICH COMMENCES AT THE POINT AND EXTENDS DOWNWARDS ALONG THE SIDE OF THE SUCCEEDING REACH TO ACCOUNT FOR THE SLACKNESS OF THE CURRENT AT THE POINT IT IS NECESSARY TO OBSERVE THAT THE STRONGEST PART OF IT INSTEAD OF TURNING SHORT ROUND THE POINT PRESERVES FOR SOME TIME THE DIREC TION GIVEN IT BY THE LAST STEEP BANK AND IS ACCORDINGLY THROWN OBLIQUELY ACROSS THE BED OF THE RIVER TO THE BAY ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE AND PURSUES ITS COURSE ALONG IT TILL THE INTERVENTION OF ANOTHER POINT AGAIN OBLIGES IT TO CHANGE SIDES IN THOSE FEW PARTS OF THE RIVER THAT ARE STRAIGHT THE BANKS UNDERGO THE LEAST ALTERATION  AS THE CURRENT RUNS PARALLEL TO  IN THE DRY SEASON SOME OF THESE BANKS ARE MORE THAN 30 FEET HIGH AND OFTEN FALL DOWN IN PIECES OF MANY TONS WEIGHT AND OCCASION SO SUDDEN AND VIOLENT AN AGITATION OF THE WATER AS SOMETIMES TO SINK LARGE BOATS THAT HAPPEN TO BE NEAR THE SHORE  IT IS MORE THAN PROBABLE THAT THE STRAIGHT PARTS OWE THEIR EXISTENCE TO THE TENACITY OF THE SOIL OF WHICH THEIR BANKS ARE COMPOSED WHATEVER THE CAUSE MAY BE THE EFFECT VERY CLEARLY POINTS OUT SUCH SITUATIONS AS THE PROPEREST FOR PLACING TOWNS IN THEM96 MR RENNELLS ACCOUNT OF THE THEM BUT THE LEAST INFLECTION OF COURSE HAS THE EFFECT OF THROW ING THE CURRENT AGAINST THE BANK AND IF THIS HAPPENS IN A PART WHERE THE SOIL IS COMPOSED OF LOOSE SAND IT PRODUCES IN TIME A SERPENTINE WINDING IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE REPEATED ADDITIONS MADE TO THE SHELVING BANK BEFORE MENTIONED BECOME IN TIME AN ENCROACHMENT ON THE CHANNEL OF THE RIVER AND THIS IS AGAIN COUNTERBALANCED BY THE DEPREDATIONS MADE ON THE OPPOSITE STEEP BANK THE FRAG MENTS OF WHICH EITHER BRING ABOUT A REPETITION OF THE CIRCUM STANCES ABOVE RECITED OR FORM A BANK OR SHALLOW IN THE MIDST OF THE CHANNEL THUS A STEEP AND A SHELVING BANK ARE ALTERNATELY FORMED IN THE CROOKED PARTS OF THE RIVER THE STEEP ONE BEING THE INDENTED SIDE AND THE SHELVING ONE THE PROJECTING AND THUS A CONTINUAL FLUCTUATION OF COURSE IS INDUCED IN ALL THE WINDING PARTS OF THE RIVER EACH MEANDER HAVING A PERPETUAL TENDENCY TO DEVIATE MORE AND MORE FROM THE LINE OF THE GENERAL COURSE OF THE RIVER BY EATING DEEPER INTO THE BAYS AND AT THE SAME TIME ADDING TO THE POINTS TILL EITHER THE OPPOSITE BAYS MEET OR THE STREAM BREAKS THROUGH THE NARROW ISTHMUS AND RESTORES A TEMPORARY STRAIGHTNESS TO THE CHANNEL SEVERAL OF THE WINDINGS OF THE GANGES AND ITS BRANCHES ARE FAST APPROACHING TO THIS STATE AND IN OTHERS IT ACTUALLY EXISTS AT PRESENT THE EXPERIENCE OF THESE CHANGES SHOULD OPERATE AGAINST ATTEMPTING CANALS OF ANY LENGTH IN THE HIGHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND I MUCH DOUBT IF ANY IN THE LOWER PARTS WOULD LONG CONTINUE NAVIGABLE DURING ELEVEN YEARS OF MY RESIDENCE IN BENGAL THE OUTLET OR HEAD OF THE JELLINGHY RIVER WAS GRA DUALLY REMOVED THREE QUARTERS OF A MILE FARTHER DOWN AND BY TWO SURVEYS OF A PART OF THE ADJACENT BANK OF THE GANGES TAKEN ABOUT THE DISTANCE OF NINE YEARS FROM EACH OTHER IT AP PEARED THAT THE BREADTH OF AN ENGLISH MILE AND A HALF HAD BEEN TAKENGANGES AND BURRAMPOOTER RIVERS 97 TAKEN AWAY THIS IS HOWEVER THE MOST RAPID CHANGE THAT I HAVE NOTICED A MILE IN TEN OR TWELVE YEARS BEING THE USUAL RATE OF INCROACHMENT IN PLACES WHERE THE CURRENT STRIKES WITH THE GREATEST FORCE NAMELY WHERE TWO ADJOINING REACHES AP PROACH NEAREST TO A RIGHT ANGLE IN SUCH SITUATIONS IT NOT UNFRE QUENTLY EXCAVATES GULFS  OF CONSIDERABLE LENGTH WITHIN THE BANK THESE GULFS ARE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE STRONGEST PARTS OF THE STREAM AND ARE IN FACT THE YOUNG SHOOTS IF I MAY SO EXPRESS MYSELF WHICH IN TIME STRIKE OUT AND BECOME BRANCHES OF THE RIVER FOR WE GENERALLY FIND THEM AT THOSE TURNINGS THAT HAVE THE SMALLEST ANGLES  TWO CAUSES WIDELY DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER OCCASION THE MEANDERING COURSES OF RIVERS THE ONE THE IRREGULARITY OF THE GROUND THROUGH WHICH THEY RUN WHICH OBLIGES THEM TO WANDER IN QUEST OF A DECLIVITY THE OTHER THE LOOSENESS OF THE SOIL WHICH YIELDS TO THE FRICTION OF THE BORDER OF THE STREAM THE MEANDERS IN THE FIRST CASE ARE OF COURSE AS DIGRESSIVE AND IRREGULAR AS THE SURFACE THEY ARE PROJECTED ON BUT IN THE LATTER THEY ARE SO FAR REDUCIBLE TO RULE THAT RIVERS OF UNEQUAL BULK WILL UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES TAKE A CIRCUIT TO WIND IN WHOSE EXTENT IS IN PROPORTION TO THEIR RESPECTIVE BREADTHS FOR I HAVE OBSERVED THAT  THE COUNT DE BUFFON ADVISES THE DIGGING OF SUCH GULSS IN THE BANKS OF ORDINARY RIVERS WITH A VIEW TO DIVERT THE CURRENT WHEN BRIDGES OR OTHER BUILD INGS ARE ENDANGERED BY IT  THE COURSES OF THESE BRANCHES AT THE EFFLUX GENERALLY IF NOT ALWAYS BECOME RETROGRADE TO THE COURSE OF THE RIVER FOR A SAND BANK ACCUMULATING AT THE UPPER POINT OF SEPARATION GIVES AN OBLIQUE DIRECTION UPWARDS TO THE STREAM WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE RUN OUT AT RIGHT ANGLES THIS SAND BANK BEING ALWAYS ON THE INCREASE OCCASIONS A CORROSION OF THE OPPOSITE BANK AND BY THIS MEANS ALL OR MOST OF THE OUTLETS HAVE A PROGRESSIVE MOTION DOWNWARDS AS I HAVE BEFORE REMARKED OF THE JELLINGHY RIVER IN THE FOREGOING PAGE VOL LXXI O WHEN98 MR RENNELLS ACCOUNT OF THE WHEN A BRANCH OF THE GANGES IS FALLEN SO LOW AS TO OCCUPY ONLY A PART OF ITS BED IT NO LONGER CONTINUES IN THE LINE OF ITS OLD COURSE BUT WORKS ITSELF A NEW CHANNEL WHICH WINDS FROM SIDE TO SIDE ACROSS THE FORMER ONE I HAVE OBSERVED TOO THAT IN TWO STREAMS OF EQUAL SIZE THAT WHICH HAS THE FLOWEST CUR RENT HAS ALSO THE SMALLEST WINDINGS FOR AS THESE IN THE PRESENT CASE ARE SOLELY OWING TO THE DEPREDATIONS MADE ON THE BANKS BY THE FORCE OF THE CURRENT SO THE EXTENT OF THESE DEPREDA TIONS OR IN OTHER WORDS THE DIMENSIONS OF THE WINDINGS WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE DEGREE OF FORCE ACTING ON THE BANKS THE WINDINGS OF THE GANGES IN THE PLAINS ARE DOUBTLESS OWING TO THE LOOSENESS OF THE SOIL AND I THINK THE PROOF OF IT IS THAT THEY ARE PERPETUALLY CHANGING WHICH THOSE ORIGI NALLY INDUCED BY AN INEQUALITY OF SURFACE CAN SELDOM OR NEVER DO  I CAN EASILY SUPPOSE THAT IF THE GANGES WAS TURNED INTO A STRAIGHT CANAL CUT THROUGH THE GROUND IT NOW TRAVERSES IN THE MOST WINDING PARTS OF ITS COURSE ITS STRAIGHTNESS WOULD BE OF SHORT DURATION SOME YIELDING PART OF THE BANK OR THAT WHICH HAPPENED TO BE THE MOST STRONGLY ACTED ON WOULD FIRST BE CORRODED OR DISSOLVED THUS A BAY OR CAVITY WOULD BE FORMED IN THE SIDE OF THE BANK THIS BEGETS AN INFLECTION OF THE CUR RENT WHICH FALLING OBLIQUELY ON THE SIDE OF THE BAY CORRODES IT INCESSANTLY WHEN THE CURRENT HAS PASSED THE INNERMOST PART OF THE BAY IT RECEIVES A NEW DIRECTION AND IS THROWN  IT HAS BEEN REMARKED THAT THE COURSES OF RIVERS BECOME MORE WINDING AS THEY APPROACH THE SEA THIS I BELIEVE WILL ONLY HOLD GOOD IN SUCH AS TAKE THE LATTER PART OF THEIR COURSE THROUGH A SANDY SOIL IN THE GANGES AND OTHER RIVERS SUBJECT TO CONSIDERABLE VARIATIONS IN THE BULK OF THEIR STREAMS THE BEST MARKS OF THE VICINITY OF THE SEA ARE THE LOWNESS OF THE RIVER BANKS AND THE INCREASING MUDDINESS OF THE SHALLOWS IN ITS BED OBLIQUELYGANGES AND BURRAMPOOTER RIVERS 99 OBLIQUELY TOWARDS THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE CANAL DEPOSITING IN ITS WAY THE MATTER EXCAVATED FROM THE BAY AND WHICH BEGINS TO FORM A SHALLOW OR BANK CONTIGUOUS TO THE BORDER OF THE CANAL HERE THEN IS THE ORIGIN OF SUCH WINDINGS AS OWE THEIR EXISTENCE TO THE NATURE OF THE SOIL THE BAY SO CORRODED IN TIME BE COMES LARGE ENOUGH TO GIVE A NEW DIRECTION TO THE BODY OF THE CANAL AND THE MATTER EXCAVATED FROM THE BAY IS SO DISPOSED AS TO ASSIST IN THROWING THE CURRENT AGAINST THE OPPOSITE BANK WHERE A PROCESS SIMILAR TO THAT I HAVE BEEN DESCRIBING WILL BE BEGUN THE ACTION OF THE CURRENT ON THE BANK WILL ALSO HAVE THE EFFECT OF DEEPENING THE BORDER OF THE CHANNEL NEAR IT AND THIS AGAIN INCREASES THE VELOCITY OF THE CURRENT IN THAT PART THUS WOULD THE CANAL GRADUALLY TAKE A NEW FORM TILL IT BECAME WHAT THE RIVER NOW IS EVEN WHEN THE WINDINGS HAVE LESSENED THE DESCENT ONE HALF WE STILL FIND THE CURRENT TOO POWERFUL FOR THE BANKS TO WITHSTAND IT THERE ARE NOT WANTING INSTANCES OF A TOTAL CHANGE OF COURSE IN SOME OF THE BENGAL RIVERS  THE COSA RIVER EQUAL TO THE RHINE ONCE RAN BY PURNEAH AND JOINED THE GANGES OPPOSITE RAJEMAL ITS JUNCTION IS NOW 45 MILES HIGHER UP GOUR THE ANCIENT CAPITAL OF BENGAL STOOD ON THE BANKS OF THE GANGES APPEARANCES FAVOUR VERY STRONGLY THE OPINION THAT THE GANGES HAD ITS FORMER BED IN THE TRACT NOW OCCUPIED BY THE LAKES AND MORASSES BETWEEN NATTORE AND JAFFIERGUNGE STRIKING OUT OF ITS PRESENT COURSE AT BAULEAH AND PASSING BY POOTYAH WITH AN EQUAL DEGREE OF PROBABILITY FAVOURED BY TRADITION WE MAY TRACE ITS SUPPOSED COURSE BY DACCA TO A JUNCTION WITH THE BURRAMPOOTER OR MEGNA NEAR FRINGYBAZAR WHERE THE ACCUMU  THE MOOTYJYL LAKE IS ONE OF THE WINDINGS OF A FORMER CHANNEL OF THE COS SIMBUZAR RIVER O 2 LATION100 MR RENNELLS ACCOUNT OF THE LATION OF TWO SUCH MIGHTY STREAMS PROBABLY SCOOPED OUT THE PRESENT AMAZING BED OF THE MEGNA  IN TRACING THE SEA COAST OF THE DELTA WE FIND NO LESS THAN EIGHT OPENINGS EACH OF WHICH WITHOUT HESITATION ONE PRO NOUNCES TO HAVE BEEN IN ITS TIME THE PRINCIPAL MOUTH OF THE GANGES NOR IS THE OCCASIONAL DEVIATION OF THE PRINCIPAL BRANCH PROBABLY THE ONLY CAUSE OF FLUCTUATION IN THE DIMENSIONS OF THE DELTA ONE OBSERVES THAT THE DELTAS OF CAPITAL RIVERS THE TROPICAL ONES PARTICULARLY ENCROACH UPON THE SEA NOW IS NOT THIS OWING TO THE MUD AND SAND BROUGHT DOWN BY THE RIVERS AND GRADUALLY DEPOSITED FROM THE REMOTEST AGES DOWN TO THE PRESENT TIME THE RIVERS WE KNOW ARE LOADED WITH MUD AND SAND AT THEIR ENTRANCE INTO THE SEA AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE SEA RECOVERS ITS TRANSPARENCY AT THE DISTANCE OF TWENTY LEAGUES FROM THE COAST WHICH CAN ONLY ARISE FROM THE WATERS HAVING PRECIPITATED THEIR EARTHY PARTICLES WITHIN THAT SPACE THE SAND AND MUD BANKS AT THIS TIME EXTEND TWENTY MILES OFF SOME OF THE ISLANDS IN THE MOUTHS OF THE GANGES AND BURRAMPOOTER AND IN MANY PLACES RISE WITHIN A FEW FEET OF THE SURFACE SOME FUTURE GENERATION WILL PROBABLY SEE THESE BANKS RISE ABOVE WATER AND SUCCEEDING ONES POSSESS AND CULTIVATE THEM NEXT TO EARTH QUAKES PERHAPS THE FLOODS OF THE TROPICAL RIVERS PRODUCE THE QUICKEST ALTERATIONS IN THE FACE OF OUR GLOBE EXTENSIVE ISLANDS ARE FORMED IN THE CHANNEL OF THE GANGES DURING A PERIOD FAR SHORT OF THAT OF A MANS LIFE SO THAT THE WHOLE PROCESS LIES  MEGNA AND BURRAMPOOTER ARE NAMES BELONGING TO THE SAME RIVER IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF ITS COURSE THE MEGNA FALLS INTO THE BURRAMPOOTER AND THOUGH A MUCH SMALLER RIVER COMMUNICATES ITS NAME TO THE OTHER DURING THE REST OF ITS COURSE WITHINGANGES AND BURRAMPOOTER RIVERS 101 WITHIN THE COMPASS OF HIS OBSERVATION  SOME OF THESE ISLANDS FOUR OR FIVE MILES IN EXTENT ARE FORMED AT THE ANGULAR TURNINGS OF THE RIVER AND WERE ORIGINALLY LARGE SAND BANKS THROWN UP ROUND THE POINTS IN THE MANNER BEFORE DESCRIBED BUT AFTER WARDS INSULATED BY BREACHES OF THE RIVER OTHERS ARE FORMED IN THE STRAIGHT PARTS OF THE RIVER AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREAM AND OWE THEIR ORIGIN TO SOME OBSTRUCTION LURKING AT THE BOTTOM WHETHER THIS BE THE FRAGMENTS OF THE RIVER BANK A LARGE TREE SWEPT DOWN FROM IT OR A SUNKEN BOAT IT IS SUFFICIENT FOR A FOUNDATION AND A HEAP OF SAND IS QUICKLY COLLECTED BELOW IT THIS ACCUMULATES AMAZINGLY FAST IN THE COURSE OF A FEW YEARS IT PEEPS ABOVE WATER AND HAVING NOW USURPED A CONSI DERABLE PORTION OF THE CHANNEL THE RIVER BORROWS ON EACH SIDE TO SUPPLY THE DEFICIENCY IN ITS BED AND IN SUCH PARTS OF THE RIVER WE ALWAYS FIND STEEP BANKS ON BOTH SIDES  EACH PERIODI CAL FLOOD BRINGS AN ADDITION OF MATTER TO THIS GROWING ISLAND INCREASING IT IN HEIGHT AS WELL AS EXTENSION UNTIL ITS TOP IS PER FECTLY ON A LEVEL WITH THE BANKS THAT INCLUDE IT AND AT THAT PERIOD OF ITS GROWTH IT HAS MOULD ENOUGH ON IT FOR THE PUR POSES OF CULTIVATION WHICH IS OWING TO THE MUD LEFT ON IT WHEN THE WATERS SUBSIDE AND IS INDEED A PART OF THE AECONOMY WHICH NATURE OBSERVES IN FERTILIZING THE LANDS IN GENERAL WHILST THE RIVER IS FORMING NEW ISLANDS IN ONE PART IT IS SWEEPING AWAY OLD ONES IN OTHER PARTS IN THE PROGRESS OF THIS DESTRUCTIVE OPERATION WE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES OF OBSERVING BY MEANS OF THE SECTIONS OF THE FALLING BANK THE REGULAR DISTRI  ACCORDINGLY THE LAWS RESPECTING ALLUVION ARE ASCERTAINED WITH GREAT PRE CISION  THIS EVIDENTLY POINTS OUT THE MEANS FOR PREVENTING ENCROACHMENTS ON A RIVER BANK IN THE STRAIGHT PARTS OF ITS COURSE VIZ TO REMOVE THE SHALLOWS IN THE MIDDLE OF ITS CHANNEL BUTION102 MR RENNELLS ACCOUNT OF THE BUTION OF THE SEVERAL STRATA OF SAND AND EARTHS LYING ABOVE ONE ANOTHER IN THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY DECREASE IN GRAVITY AS THEY CAN ONLY OWE THIS DISPOSITION TO THE AGENCY OF THE STREAM THAT DEPOSITED THEM IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THESE SUBSTANCES ARE SUSPENDED AT DIFFERENT HEIGHTS IN THE STREAM ACCORDING TO THEIR RESPECTIVE GRAVITIES WE NEVER FIND A STRATUM OF EARTH UNDER ONE OF SAND FOR THE MUDDY PARTICLES FLOAT NEAREST THE SURFACE  I HAVE COUNTED SEVEN DISTINCT STRATA IN A SECTION OF ONE OF THESE ISLANDS INDEED NOT ONLY THE ISLANDS BUT MOST OF THE RIVER BANKS WEAR THE SAME APPEARANCE FOR AS THE RIVER IS ALWAYS CHANGING ITS PRESENT BED AND VERGING TOWARDS THE SITE OF SOME FORMER ONE NOW OBLITERATED THIS MUST NECESSARILY BE THE CASE AS A STRONG PRESUMPTIVE PROOF OF THE WANDERING OF THE GANGES FROM THE ONE SIDE OF THE DELTA TO THE OTHER I MUST OB SERVE THAT THERE IS NO APPEARANCE OF VIRGIN EARTH BETWEEN THE TIPERAH HILLS ON THE EAST AND THE PROVINCE OF BURDWAN ON THE WEST NOR ON THE NORTH TILL WE ARRIVE AT DACCA AND BAULEAH IN ALL THE SECTIONS OF THE NUMEROUS CREEKS AND RIVERS IN THE DELTA NOTHING APPEARS BUT SAND AND BLACK MOULD IN REGULAR STRATA TILL WE ARRIVE AT THE CLAY THAT FORMS THE LOWER PART OF THEIR BEDS THERE IS NOT ANY SUBSTANCE SO COARSE AS GRAVEL EITHER IN THE DELTA OR NEARER THE SEA THAN 400 MILES  WHERE A ROCKY POINT A PART OF THE BASE OF THE NEIGHBOURING HILLS PRO JECTS INTO THE RIVER BUT OUT OF THE VICINITY OF THE GREAT RIVERS THE SOIL IS EITHER RED YELLOW OR OF A DEEP BROWN  A GLASS OF WATER TAKEN OUT OF THE GANGES WHEN AT ITS HEIGHT YIELDS ABOUT ONE PART IN FOUR OF MUD NO WONDER THEN THAT THE SUBSIDING WATERS SHOULD QUICKLY FORM A STRATUM OF EARTH OR THAT THE DELTA SHOULD ENCROACH UPON THE SEA  AT OUDANULLA I COMEGANGES AND BURRAMPOOTER RIVERS 103 I COME NOW TO THE PARTICULARS OF THE ANNUAL SWELLING AND OVERSLOWING OF THE GANGES  IT APPEARS TO OWE ITS INCREASE AS MUCH TO THE RAIN WATER THAT FALLS IN THE MOUNTAINS CONTIGUOUS TO ITS SOURCE AND TO THE SOURCES OF THE GREAT NORTHERN RIVERS THAT FALL INTO IT AS TO THAT WHICH FALLS IN THE PLAINS OF HINDOOSTAN FOR IT RISES FIFTEEN FEET AND A HALF OUT OF THIRTYTWO THE SUM TOTAL OF ITS RISING BY THE LATTER END OF JUNE AND IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE RAINY SEASON DOES NOT BEGIN IN MOST OF THE FLAT COUNTRIES TILL ABOUT THAT TIME IN THE MOUNTAINS IT BEGINS EARLY IN  APRIL AND BY THE LATTER END OF THAT MONTH WHEN THE RAINWATER HAS REACHED BENGAL THE RIVERS BEGIN TO RISE BUT BY VERY SLOW DEGREES FOR THE IN CREASE IS ONLY ABOUT AN INCH PER DAY FOR THE FIRST FORTNIGHT IT THEN GRADUALLY AUGMENTS TO TWO AND THREE INCHES BEFORE ANY  AN OPINION HAS LONG PREVAILED THAT THE SWELLING OF THE GANGES PREVIOUS TO THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE RAINY SEASON IN THE FLAT COUNTRIES IS IN A GREAT MEASURE OWING TO THE MELTING OF THE SNOW IN THE MOUNTAINS I WILL NOT GO SO FAR AS TOTALLY TO DISALLOW THE FACT BUT CAN BY NO MEANS SUPPOSE THAT THE QUANTITY OF SNOW WATER BEARS ANY PROPORTION TO THE INCREASE OF THE RIVER  THE VAST COLLECTION OF VAPOURS WASTED FROM THE SEA BY THE SOUTHERLY OR SOUTHWEST MONSOON ARE SUDDENLY STOPPED BY THE LOSTY RIDGE OF MOUNTAINS THAT RUNS FROM EAST TO WEST THROUGH THIBET IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE ACCUMULATION AND CON DENSATION OF THESE VAPOURS MUST FIRST HAPPEN IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE OBSTACLE AND SUCCESSIVELY IN PLACES MORE REMOTE AS FRESH SUPPLIES ARRIVE TO SILL THE ATMO SPHERE HENCE THE PRIORITY OF COMMENCEMENT OF THE RAINY SEASON IN PLACES THAT LIE NEAREST THE MOUNTAINS ALL THE RIVERS THAT ARE SITUATED WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE MONSOONS OR SHIFTING TRADE WINDS ARE SUBJECT TO OVERFLOWINGS AT ANNUALLY STATED PERIODS LIKE THE GANGES AND THESE PERIODS RETURN DURING THE SEASON OF THE SOUTHERLY WIND THAT BEING THE ONLY WIND WHICH BRINGS VAPOURS FROM THE SEA AND THIS BEING PERIODICAL THE FALLS OF RAIN MUST NECESSARILY BE SO TOO THE NORTHERLY WIND WHICH BLOWS ONLY OVER THE LAND IS DRY FOR NO RAIN EXCEPT CASUAL SHOWERS FALLS DURING THE CONTINUANCE OF THAT MONSOON QUANTITY104 MR RENNELLS ACCOUNT OF THE QUANTITY OF RAIN FALLS IN THE FLAT COUNTRIES AND WHEN THE RAIN BECOMES GENERAL THE INCREASE ON A MEDIUM IS FIVE INCHES PER DAY BY THE LATTER END OF JULY ALL THE LOWER PARTS OF BENGAL CONTIGUOUS TO THE GANGES AND BURRAMPOOTER ARE OVERFLOWED AND FORM AN INUNDATION OF MORE THAN A HUNDRED MILES IN WIDTH NOTHING APPEARING BUT VILLAGES AND TREES EXCEPTING VERY RARELY THE TOP OF AN ELEVATED SPOT THE ARTIFICIAL MOUND OF SOME DE SERTED VILLAGE APPEARING LIKE AN ISLAND THE INUNDATIONS IN BENGAL DIFFER FROM THOSE IN EGYPT IN THIS PARTICULAR THAT THE NILE OWES ITS FLOODS ENTIRELY TO THE RAIN WATER THAT FALLS IN THE MOUNTAINS NEAR ITS SOURCE BUT THE INUN DATIONS IN BENGAL ARE AS MUCH OCCASIONED BY THE RAIN THAT FALLS THERE AS BY THE WATERS OF THE GANGES AND AS A PROOF OF IT THE LANDS IN GENERAL ARE OVERFLOWED TO A CONSIDERABLE HEIGHT LONG BEFORE THE BED OF THE RIVER IS FILLED IT MUST BE REMARKED THAT THE GROUND ADJACENT TO THE RIVER BANK TO THE EXTENT OF SOME MILES IS CONSIDERABLY HIGHER THAN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY  AND SERVES TO SEPARATE THE WATERS OF THE INUNDATION FROM THOSE OF THE RIVER UNTIL IT OVERFLOWS THIS HIGH GROUND IS IN SOME SEASONS COVERED A FOOT OR MORE BUT THE HEIGHT OF THE INUNDA TION WITHIN VARIES OF COURSE ACCORDING TO THE IRREGULARITIES OF THE GROUND AND IS IN SOME PLACES TWELVE FEET EVEN WHEN THE INUNDATION BECOMES GENERAL THE RIVER STILL SHEWS ITSELF AS WELL BY THE GRASS AND REEDS ON ITS BANKS AS BY ITS RAPID AND MUDDY STREAM FOR THE WATER OF THE INUNDATION ACQUIRES A BLACKISH HUE BY HAVING BEEN SO LONG STAGNANT  THIS PROPERTY OF THE BANK IS WELL ACCOUNTED FOR BY COUNT BUFFON WHO IMPUTES IT TO THE PRECIPITATION OF MUD MADE BY THE WATERS OF THE RIVER WHEN IT OVERFLOWS THE INUNDATION SAYS HE PURIFIES ITSELF AS IT FLOWS OVER THE PLAIN SO THAT THE PRECIPITATION MUST BE GREATEST ON THE PARTS NEAREST TO THE MARGIN OF THE RIVER 1 AMONGSTGANGES AND BURRAMPOOTER RIVERS 105 AMONGST GRASS AND OTHER VEGETABLES NOR DOES IT EVER LOSE THIS TINGE WHICH IS A PROOF OF THE PREDOMINANCY OF THE RAIN WATER OVER THAT OF THE RIVER AS THE SLOW RATE OF MOTION OF THE INUN DATION WHICH DOES NOT EXCEED HALF A MILE PER HOUR IS OF THE REMARKABLE FLATNESS OF THE COUNTRY THERE ARE PARTICULAR TRACTS OF LAND WHICH FROM THE NATURE OF THEIR CULTURE AND SPECIES OF PRODUCTIONS REQUIRE LESS MOIS TURE THAN OTHERS AND YET BY THE LOWNESS OF THEIR SITUATION WOULD REMAIN TOO LONG INUNDATED WERE THEY NOT GUARDED BY DIKES OR DAMS FROM SO COPIOUS AN INUNDATION AS WOULD OTHER WISE HAPPEN FROM THE GREAT ELEVATION OF THE SURFACE OF THE RIVER ABOVE THEM THESE DIKES ARE KEPT UP AT AN ENORMOUS EXPENCE AND YET DO NOT ALWAYS SUCCEED FOR WANT OF TENACITY IN THE SOIL OF WHICH THEY ARE COMPOSED DURING THE SWOLN STATE OF THE RIVER THE TIDE TOTALLY LOSES ITS EFFECT OF COUNTERACTING THE STREAM AND IN A GREAT MEASURE THAT OF EBBING AND FLOWING EXCEPT VERY NEAR THE SEA IT IS NOT UN COMMON FOR A STRONG WIND THAT BLOWS UP THE RIVER FOR ANY CON TINUANCE TO SWELL THE WATERS TWO FEET ABOVE THE ORDINARY LEVEL AT THAT SEASON AND SUCH ACCIDENTS HAVE OCCASIONED THE LOSS OF WHOLE CROPS OF RICE  A VERY TRAGICAL EVENT HAPPENED AT LUCKIPOUR  IN 1763 BY A STRONG GALE OF WIND CONSPIRING WITH A HIGH SPRING TIDE AT A SEASON WHEN THE PERIODICAL FLOOD WAS WITHIN A FOOT AND HALF OF ITS HIGHEST PITCH IT IS SAID THAT THE WATERS ROSE SIX FEET ABOVE THE ORDINARY LEVEL CERTAIN IT IS THAT  THE RICE I SPEAK OF IS OF A PARTICULAR KIND FOR THE GROWTH OF ITS STALK KEEPS PACE WITH THE INCREASE OF THE FLOOD AT ORDINARY TIMES BUT IS DESTROYED BY A TOO SUDDEN RISE OF THE WATER THE HARVEST IS OFTEN REAPED IN BOATS THERE IS ALSO A KIND OF GRASS WHICH OVERTOPS THE FLOOD IN THE SAME MANNER AND AT A SMALL DISTANCE HAS THE APPEARANCE OF A FIELD OF THE RICHEST VERDURE  THIS PLACE IS SITUATED ABOUT FIFTY MILES FROM THE SEA VOL LXXI P THE106 MR RENNELLS ACCOUNT OF THE THE INHABITANTS OF A CONSIDERABLE DISTRICT WITH THEIR HOUSES AND CATTLE WERE TOTALLY SWEPT AWAY AND TO AGGRAVATE THEIR DIS TRESS IT HAPPENED IN A PART OF THE COUNTRY WHICH SCARCE PRO DUCES A SINGLE TREE FOR A DROWNING MAN TO ESCAPE TO EMBARKATIONS OF EVERY KIND TRAVERSE THE INUNDATION THOSE BOUND UPWARDS AVAILING THEMSELVES OF A DIRECT COURSE AND STILL WATER AT A SEASON WHEN EVERY STREAM RUSHES LIKE A TORRENT THE WIND TOO WHICH AT THIS SEASON BLOWS REGULARLY FROM THE SOUTH EAST  FAVOURS THEIR PROGRESS INSOMUCH THAT A VOYAGE WHICH TAKES UP NINE OR TEN DAYS BY THE COURSE OF THE RIVER WHEN CON FINED WITHIN ITS BANKS IS NOW EFFECTED IN FIX HUSBANDRY AND GRAZING ARE BOTH SUSPENDED AND THE PEASANT TRAVERSES IN HIS BOAT THOSE FIELDS WHICH IN ANOTHER SEASON HE WAS WONT TO PLOW HAPPY THAT THE ELEVATED SITE OF THE RIVER BANKS PLACE THE HERBAGE THEY CONTAIN WITHIN HIS REACH OTHERWISE HIS CATTLE MUST PERISH THE FOLLOWING IS A TABLE OF THE GRADUAL INCREASE OF THE

BURRAMPOOTER RIVERS 107 THESE OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE IN A SEASON WHEN THE WATERS ROSE RATHER HIGHER THAN USUAL SO THAT WE MAY TAKE 31 FEET FOR THE MEDIUM OF THE INCREASE THE INUNDATION IS NEARLY AT A STAND FOR SOME DAYS PRECEDING THE MIDDLE OF AUGUST WHEN IT BEGINS TO RUN OFF FOR ALTHOUGH GREAT QUANTITIES OF RAIN FALL IN THE FLAT COUNTRIES DURING AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER YET BY A PARTIAL CESSATION OF THE RAINS IN THE MOUNTAINS THERE HAPPENS A DEFICIENCY IN THE SUPPLIES NECESSARY TO KEEP UP THE INUNDATION  THE QUANTITY OF THE DAILY DE CREASE OF THE RIVER IS NEARLY IN THE FOLLOWING PROPORTION DURING THE LATTER HALF OF AUGUST AND ALL SEPTEMBER FROM THREE TO FOUR INCHES FROM SEPTEMBER TO THE END OF NOVEMBER IT GRADUALLY LESSENS FROM THREE INCHES TO AN INCH AND A HALF AND FROM NOVEMBER TO THE LATTER END OF APRIL IT IS ONLY HALF AN INCH PER DAY AT A MEDIUM THESE PROPORTIONS MUST BE UN DERSTOOD TO RELATE TO SUCH PARTS OF THE RIVER AS ARE REMOVED FROM THE INFLUENCE OF THE TIDES OF WHICH MORE WILL BE SAID BY AND BY THE DECREASE OF THE INUNDATION DOES NOT ALWAYS KEEP PACE WITH THAT OF THE RIVER BY REASON OF THE HEIGHT OF THE BANKS BUT AFTER THE BEGINNING OF OCTOBER WHEN THE RAIN HAS NEARLY CEASED THE REMAINDER OF THE INUNDATION GOES OFF QUICKLY BY EVAPORATION LEAVING THE LANDS HIGHLY MANURED AND IN A STATE FIT TO RECEIVE THE SEED AFTER THE SIMPLE OPERATION OF PLOWING THERE IS A CIRCUMSTANCE ATTENDING THE INCREASE OF THE GANGES AND WHICH I BELIEVE IS LITTLE KNOWN OR ATTENDED TO BECAUSE FEW PEOPLE HAVE MADE EXPERIMENTS ON THE HEIGHTS TO WHICH THE  I HAVE STATED THE MIDDLE OF AUGUST FOR THE PERIOD WHEN THE WATERS BEGIN TO RUN OFF AND IN GENERAL IT HAPPENS WITH MORE REGULARITY THAN THE VICISSITUDES OF THE SEASONS DO BUT THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS TO IT FOR IN THE YEAR 1774 THE RIVERS KEPT UP FOR NEAR A MONTH AFTER THE USUAL TIME P 2 PERIODICAL108 MR RENNELLS ACCOUNT OF THE PERIODICAL FLOOD RISES IN DIFFERENT PLACES THE CIRCUMSTANCE I ALLUDE TO IS THE DIFFERENCE OF THE QUANTITY OF THE INCREASE AS EXPRESSED IN THE FOREGOING TABLE IN PLACES MORE OR LESS REMOTE FROM THE SEA IT IS A FACT CONFIRMED BY REPEATED EXPERIMENTS THAT FROM ABOUT THE PLACE WHERE THE TIDE COMMENCES TO THE SEA THE HEIGHT OF THE PERIODICAL INCREASE DIMINISHES GRADUALLY UNTIL IT TOTALLY DISAPPEARS AT THE POINT OF CONFLUENCE INDEED THIS IS PERFECTLY CONFORMABLE TO THE KNOWN LAWS OF FLUIDS THE OCEAN PRESERVES THE SAME LEVEL AT ALL SEASONS UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUM STANCES OF TIDE AND NECESSARILY INFLUENCES THE LEVEL OF ALL THE WATERS THAT COMMUNICATE WITH IT UNLESS PRECIPITATED IN THE FORM OF A CATARACT COULD WE SUPPOSE FOR A MOMENT THAT THE IN CREASED COLUMN OF WATER OF 31 FEET PERPENDICULAR WAS CONTI NUED ALL THE WAY TO THE SEA BY SOME PRETERNATURAL AGENCY WHENEVER THAT AGENCY WAS REMOVED THE HEAD OF THE COLUMN WOULD DIFFUSE ITSELF OVER THE OCEAN AND THE REMAINING PARTS WOULD FOLLOW FROM AS FAR BACK AS THE INFLUENCE OF THE OCEAN EXTENDED FORMING A SLOPE WHOSE PERPENDICULAR HEIGHT WOULD BE 31 FEET THIS IS THE PRECISE STATE IN WHICH WE FIND IT AT THE POINT OF JUNCTION WITH THE SEA THE HEIGHT IS THE SAME IN BOTH SEASONS AT EQUAL TIMES OF THE TIDE AT LUCKIPOUR THERE IS A DIFFERENCE OF ABOUT SIX FEET BETWEEN THE HEIGHTS IN THE DIF FERENT SEASONS AT DACCA AND PLACES ADJACENT 14 AND NEAR CUSTEE 31 FEET HERE THEN IS A REGULAR SLOPE FOR THE DISTANCES BETWEEN THE PLACES BEAR A PROPORTION TO THE RESPECTIVE HEIGHTS THIS SLOPE MUST ADD TO THE RAPIDITY OF THE STREAM FOR SUP POSING THE DESCENT TO HAVE BEEN ORIGINALLY FOUR INCHES PER MILE THIS WILL INCREASE IT TO ABOUT FIVE AND AN HALF CUSTEE IS ABOUT 240 MILES FROM THE SEA BY THE COURSE OF THE RIVER AND THE SURFACE OF THE RIVER THERE DURING THE DRY SEASON IS ABOUT 80 FEETGANGES AND BURRAMPOOTER RIVERS 109 FEET ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE SEA AT HIGH WATER  THUS FAR DOES THE OCEAN MANIFEST ITS DOMINION IN BOTH SEASONS IN THE ONE BY THE EBBING AND FLOWING OF ITS TIDES AND IN THE OTHER BY DE PRESSING THE PERIODICAL FLOOD TILL THE SURFACE OF IT COINCIDES AS NEARLY WITH ITS OWN AS THE DESCENT OF THE CHANNEL OF THE RIVER WILL ADMIT  SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES TAKE PLACE IN THE JELLINGHY HOOGLY AND BURRAMPOOTER RIVERS AND I SUPPOSE IN ALL OTHERS THAT ARE SUBJECT EITHER TO PERIODICAL OR OCCASIONAL SWELLINGS NOT ONLY DOES THE FLOOD DIMINISH NEAR THE SEA BUT THE RIVER BANKS DIMINISH IN THE SAME PROPORTION SO THAT IN THE DRY SEA SON THE HEIGHT OF THE PERIODICAL FLOOD MAY BE KNOWN BY THAT OF THE BANK I AM AWARE OF AN OBJECTION THAT MAY BE MADE TO THE ABOVE SOLUTION WHICH IS THAT THE LOWNESS OF THE BANKS IN PLACES NEAR THE SEA IS THE TRUE REASON WHY THE FLOODS DO NOT ATTAIN SO CONSIDERABLE A HEIGHT AS IN PLACES FARTHER REMOVED FROM IT AND WHERE THE BANKS ARE HIGH FOR THAT THE RIVER WANTING A BANK TO CONFINE IT DIFFUSES ITSELF OVER THE SURFACE OF THE COUNTRY IN  THE TIDES IN THE RIVER AMAZONS ARE PERCEPTIBLE AT 600 MILES ABOVE ITS MOUTH BUT AT AN ELEVATION OF ONLY 90 FEET ACCORDING TO M DE CONDAMINE IT E MAINS TO BE TOLD WHAT THE STATE OF THE RIVER WAS AT THE TIME OF MAKING THE EXPERIMENT BECAUSE THE LANDFLOODS HAVE THE EFFECT OF SHORTENING THE LIMITS OF THE TIDES WAY  THE COUNT DE BUFFON HAS SLIGHTLY MENTIONED THIS CIRCUMSTANCE ATTENDING THE SWELLING OF RIVERS BUT IMPUTES IT TO THE INCREASED VELOCITY OF THE CURRENT AS THE RIVER APPROACHES THE SEA WHICH SAYS HE CARRIES OFF THE INUNDATION SO QUICK AS TO ABATE ITS HEIGHT NOW WITH THE UTMOST DEFERENCE TO SO GREAT AN AUTHORITY I COULD NEVER PERCEIVE THAT THE CURRENT EITHER IN THE GANGES OR ANY OTHER RIVER WAS STRONGER NEAR THE SEA THAN AT A DISTANCE FROM IT EVEN IF WE ADMIT AN ACCELERATION OF THE CURRENT DURING THE EBB TIDE THE FLUX RETARDS IT IN SO CONSIDERABLE A DEGREE AS AT LEAST TO COUNTER  THE EFFECTS PRODUCED BY THE TEMPORARY INCREASE OF VELOCITY ANSWER110 MR RENNELLS ACCOUNT OF THE ANSWER TO THIS I SHALL OBSERVE THAT IT IS PROVED BY EXPERIMENT THAT AT ANY GIVEN TIME THE QUANTITY OF THE INCREASE IN DIFFERENT PLACES BEARS A JUST PROPORTION TO THE SUM TOTAL OF THE INCREASE IN EACH PLACE RESPECTIVELY OR IN OTHER WORDS THAT WHEN THE RIVER HAS RISEN THREE FEET AT DACCA WHERE THE WHOLE RISING IS ABOUT 14 FEET IT WILL HAVE ROSE UPWARDS OF SIX FEET AND A HALF AT CUSTEE WHERE IT RISES 31 FEET IN ALL THE QUANTITY OF WATER DISCHARGED BY THE GANGES IN ONE SECOND OF TIME DURING THE DRY SEASON IS 80000 CUBIC FEET BUT IN THE PLACE WHERE THE EXPERIMENT WAS MADE THE RIVER WHEN FULL HAS THRICE THE VOLUME OF WATER IN IT AND ITS MO TION IS ALSO ACCELERATED IN THE PROPORTION OF 5 TO 3 SO THAT THE QUANTITY DISCHARGED IN A SECOND AT THAT SEASON IS 405000 CUBIC FEET IF WE TAKE THE MEDIUM THE WHOLE YEAR THROUGH IT WILL BE NEARLY 180000 CUBIC FEET IN A SECOND THE BURRAMPOOTER WHICH HAS ITS SOURCE FROM THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE SAME MOUNTAINS THAT GIVE RISE TO THE GANGES FIRST TAKES ITS COURSE EASTWARD OR DIRECTLY OPPOSITE TO THAT OF THE GANGES THROUGH THE COUNTRY OF THIBET WHERE IT IS NAMED SANPOO OR ZANCIU WHICH BEARS THE SAME INTERPRETATION AS THE GONGA OF HINDOOSTAN NAMELY THE RIVER THE COURSE OF IT THROUGH THIBET AS GIVEN BY FATHER DU HALDE AND FORMED INTO A MAP BY MR D ANVILLE THOUGH SUFFICIENTLY EXACT FOR THE PURPOSES OF GENERAL GEOGRAPHY IS NOT PARTICULAR ENOUGH TO ASCERTAIN THE PRECISE LENGTH OF ITS COURSE AFTER WINDING WITH A RAPID CURRENT THROUGH THIBET IT WASHES THE BORDER OF THE TER RITORY OF LASSA IN WHICH IS THE RESIDENCE OF THE GRAND LAMA AND THEN DEVIATING FROM AN EAST TO A SOUTHEAST COURSE IT AP PROACHES WITHIN 220 MILES OF YUNAN THE WESTERNMOST PROVINCE OFGANGES AND BURRAMPOOTER RIVERS 111 OF CHINA HERE IT APPEARS AS IF UNDETERMINED WHETHER TO ATTEMPT A PASSAGE TO THE SEA BY THE GULF OF SIAM OR BY THAT OF BENGAL BUT SEEMINGLY DETERMINING ON THE LATTER IT TURNS SUD DENLY TO THE WEST THROUGH ASSAM AND ENTERS BENGAL ON THE NORTHEAST I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO LEARN THE EXACT PLACE WHERE IT CHANGES ITS NAME BUT AS THE PEOPLE OF ASSAM CALL IT BUR RAMPOOT IT WOULD APPEAR THAT IT TAKES THIS NAME ON ITS ENTER ING ASSAM AFTER ITS ENTRY INTO BENGAL IT MAKES A CIRCUIT ROUND THE WESTERN POINT OF THE GARROW MOUNTAINS AND THEN ALTERING ITS COURSE TO SOUTH IT MEETS THE GANGES ABOUT 40 MILES FROM THE SEA FATHER DU HALDE EXPRESSES HIS DOUBTS CONCERNING THE COURSE THAT THE SANPOO TAKES AFTER LEAVING THIBET AND ONLY SUPPOSES GENERALLY THAT IT FALLS INTO THE GULF OF BENGAL M D ANVILLE HIS GEOGRAPHER WITH GREAT REASON SUPPOSED THE SANPOO AND AVA RIVER TO BE THE SAME AND IN THIS HE WAS JUSTIFIED BY THE INFORMATION WHICH HIS MATERIALS AFFORDED HIM FOR THE BURRAM POOTER WAS REPRESENTED TO HIM AS ONE OF THE INFERIOR STREAMS THAT CONTRIBUTED ITS WATERS THE GANGES AND NOT AS ITS EQUAL OR SUPERIOR AND THIS WAS SUFFICIENT TO DIRECT HIS RESEARCHES AFTER THE MOUTH OF THE SANPOO RIVER TO SOME OTHER QUARTER THE AVA RIVER AS WELL FROM ITS BULK AS THE BENT OF ITS COURSE FOR SOME HUNDRED MILES ABOVE ITS MOUTH APPEARED TO HIM TO BE A CONTINUATION OF THE RIVER IN QUESTION AND IT WAS ACCORDINGLY DESCRIBED AS SUCH IN HIS MAPS THE AUTHORITY OF WHICH WAS JUSTLY ESTEEMED AS DECISIVE AND TILL THE YEAR 1765 THE BUR RAMPOOTER AS A CAPITAL RIVER WAS UNKNOWN IN EUROPE ON TRACING THIS RIVER IN 1765 I WAS NO LESS SURPRIZED AT FIND ING IT RATHER LARGER THAN THE GANGES THAN AT ITS COURSE PREVIOUS TO ITS ENTERING BENGAL THIS I FOUND TO BE FROM THE EAST ALTHOUGH ALL THE FORMER ACCOUNTS REPRESENTED IT AS FROM THE NORTH112 MR RENNELLS ACCOUNT OF THE NORTH AND THIS UNEXPECTED DISCOVERY SOON LED TO ENQUIRIES WHICH FURNISHED ME WITH AN ACCOUNT OF ITS GENERAL COURSE TO WITHIN 100 MILES OF THE PLACE WHERE DU HALDE LEFT THE SAN POO I COULD NO LONGER DOUBT THAT THE BURRAMPOOTER AND SANPOO WERE ONE AND THE SAME RIVER AND TO THIS WAS ADDED THE POSITIVE ASSURANCES OF THE ASSAMERS  THAT THEIR RIVER CAME  FROM THE NORTHWEST THROUGH THE BOOTAN MOUNTAINS AND TO PLACE IT BEYOND A DOUBT THAT THE SANPOO RIVER IS NOT THE SAME WITH THE RIVER OF AVA BUT THAT THIS LAST IS THE GREAT NOU KIAN OF YUNAN I HAVE IN MY POSSESSION A MANUSCRIPT DRAUGHT OF THE AVA RIVER TO WITHIN 150 MILES OF THE PLACE WHERE DU HALDE LEAVES THE NOU KIAN IN ITS COURSE TOWARDS AVA TOGETHER WITH VERY AUTHENTIC INFORMATION THAT THIS RIVER NAMED IRABATTEY BY THE PEOPLE OF AVA IS NAVIGABLE FROM THE CITY OF AVA INTO THE PROVINCE OF YUNAN IN CHINA  THE BURRAMPOOTER DURING A COURSE OF 400 MILES THROUGH BENGAL BEARS SO INTIMATE A RESEMBLANCE TO THE GANGES EXCEPT IN ONE PARTICULAR THAT ONE DESCRIPTION MAY SERVE FOR BOTH THE EXCEPTION I MEAN IS THAT DURING THE LAST 60 MILES BEFORE ITS JUNCTION WITH THE GANGES IT FORMS A STREAM WHICH IS REGULARLY FROM FOUR TO FIVE MILES WIDE AND BUT FOR ITS FRESHNESS MIGHT PASS FOR AN ARM OF THE SEA COMMON DESCRIPTION FAILS IN AN ATTEMPT TO CONVEY AN ADEQUATE IDEA OF THE GRANDEUR OF THIS MAGNIFICENT

IT PROUDLY SEEKS THE DEEP WHOSE VANQUISHD TIDE RECOILING FROM THE SHOCK YIELDS TO THIS LIQUID WEIGHT  THOMSONS SEASONS I HAVE ALREADY ENDEAVOURED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE SINGULAR BREADTH OF THE MEGNA BY SUPPOSING THAT THE GANGES ONCE JOINED IT WHERE THE ISSAMUTTY NOW DOES AND THAT THEIR JOINT WATERS SCOOPED OUT ITS PRESENT BED THE PRESENT JUNCTION OF THESE TWO MIGHTY RIVERS BELOW LUCKIPOUR PRODUCES A BODY OF RUNNING FRESH WATER HARDLY TO BE EQUALLED IN THE OLD HEMISPHERE AND PERHAPS NOT EXCEEDED IN THE NEW IT NOW FORMS A GULF INTER SPERSED WITH ISLANDS SOME OF WHICH RIVAL IN SIZE AND FERTILITY OUR ISLE OF WIGHT THE WATER AT ORDINARY TIMES IS HARDLY BRACKISH AT THE EXTREMITIES OF THESE ISLANDS AND IN THE RAINY SEASON THE SEA OR AT LEAST THE SURFACE OF IT IS PERFECTLY FRESH TO THE DISTANCE OF MANY LEAGUES OUT THE BORE WHICH IS KNOWN TO BE A SUDDEN AND ABRUPT INFLUX OF THE TIDE INTO A RIVER OR NARROW STRAIT PREVAILS IN THE PRINCIPAL BRANCHES OF THE GANGES AND IN THE MEGNA BUT THE HOOGLY RIVER AND THE PASSAGES BETWEEN THE ISLANDS AND SANDS SITUATED IN THE GULF FORMED BY THE CONFLUENCE OF THE GANGES AND MEGNA ARE MORE SUBJECT TO IT THAN THE OTHER RIVERS THIS MAY BE OWING PARTLY TO THEIR HAVING GREATER EMBOUCHURES IN PROPORTION TO THEIR CHANNELS THAN THE OTHERS HAVE BY WHICH MEANS A LARGER PROPORTION OF TIDE IS FORCED THROUGH A PASSAGE COMPARA TIVELY SMALLER AND PARTLY TO THERE

PRICE FLUC TUATIONS THROUGH REFRIGERATION BY GEORGE K HOLMES United States Department of Agriculture Cold storage was originally and primarily used for the purpose of preventing the waste of foods The Indians of the northern part of what is now the United States and of Canada packed fresh meat in snow to avoid thawing They were found doing this when the white race first came and the whites adopted the practice In the course of time the whites had their ice houses which provided cold storage facilities for milk and butter fresh meat berries and other foods for very short periods of time The main object was to pre vent waste The extension of ice cooling to refrigeration in com mercial use followed and also the packing of dressed poultry fresh oysters and other perishable foods in ice for shipment As foods were placed in some sort of temporary cold storage to prevent waste it was incidentally observed that their utility was extended in time The importance of this to men engaged in hand ling food commercially was very great With regard to the early commercialization of cold storage the testimony of Mr F G Urner of the UrnerBarry Company publishers of the New York Produce Review and of the New York Producers Price Current is quoted The development of the coldstorage industry as a public utility in food preservation was gradual and it is impossible to specify any year when it began to raise the price of the commodities stored during the season of greatest production especially as the price levels during that season have been variable ever since storage has been an important factor The greatest development of cold storage as a public utility began with the introduction of mechanical refrigeration shortly before 1890 From the latter date the development was rapid I should say that the system was established as having an influence upon prices during the flush season some where from 1890 to 1893 but it would be a work of considerable magnitude to dig out statistics of values which would indicate a positive influence upon prices due to this cause and even if the price levels were found to have advanced during the flush seasons in one of those years it would not be certain that it was due to cold storage because there are other influences affecting prices that may be of equal importance and in considering these influences it is very difficult after a lapse of twenty years to determine the controlling factors 48PREVENTION OF WASTE AND PRICE FLUCTUATION While I can not answer your questions specifically my opinion would be that this influence was first felt some time between 1890 and 1893 in respect to fresh meats dressed poultry butter and eggs So great has been the development of cold storage that it is now all but impossible to make up a complete list of commodities placed in such storage These commodities are not only foods but they include articles that may be destroyed by insects in the larval stage and nonfood articles that may be spoiled by bacteria The purpose of this storage for some articles is exclusively to prevent waste with regard to other articles the object is to prolong their commercial utility into seasons when their production is relatively low or has ceased Notwithstanding the difficulties of compiling a large list the attempt has been made with the result found in the list on pages 5556 Commercial cold storage has become so diversified and has so thoroughly entered into many lines of business that the number of public and private warehouses that provide facilities for such storage has grown to nearly 1000 in the United States In the absence of necessary information it is impossible to estimate the value of the commodities placed in these warehouses during one year but the factors for making an estimate for fresh beef mutton and pork and butter and eggs have been roughly determined by the writer and these factors indicate that the value of fresh beef placed in cold storage in a recent year mean of 19091910 and 19101911 was about 15000000 of the fresh mutton 1600000 of the fresh pork 18000000 of the butter 40000000 and of eggs 64000 000 The total wholesale value of these five commodities received into cold storage during the year was about 138000000 at the mean wholesale prices of the year in many cities throughout the United States The quantity of these commodities received into cold storage during that year has been computed to be as follows Fresh beef 131000000 pounds fresh mutton 20000000 pounds fresh pork 176000000 pounds butter 157000000 pounds eggs 296000000 dozens If these quantities are compared with the pro duction of the census year 1909 these fractions follow Of the fresh beef census slaughter 31 per cent of the fresh mutton census slaughter 41 per cent of the fresh pork census slaughter 115 per cent of the butter census farm and factory make 96 per cent of the eggs census farm production 187 per cent of the eggs cen 49THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY sus farm production plus onefourth for conjectured nonfarm pro duction 15 per cent Much definite information has been obtained by the writer for the National Department of Agriculture with regard to the business of the keeping in cold storage of fresh meats dressed poultry butter and eggs This was obtained from cold storage warehouses in all parts of the United States and was stated by them in such form as to permit calculations that establish a great variety of results These commodities have seasons of relatively high and relatively low pro duction a condition that makes them especially suited to cold stor age for the purpose of taking them out of a period of natural high production and carrying them forward to the period of natural low production According to the reports made by warehousemen the principal months when fresh beef is placed in cold storage are Sep tember October and November mutton August September and October butter June July and August and sometimes May eggs April May and June Pork is quite well distributed throughout the year and the prominence of winter receipts in cold storage is barely perceptible Poultry is made up of diverse elements Broil ers go into storage from the latter part of August until November and roasters from October to December There are besides the different varieties of poultry including turkeys November De cember and January and sometimes October and even August and September are the heavier coldstorage months During the three heavier coldstorage months of 19101911 47 per cent of the fresh beef placed in cold storage during the whole year was received into the warehouses 598 per cent of the fresh mutton 592 per cent of the dressed poultry November December and January 70 per cent of the butter and 794 per cent of the eggs On the other hand in the lighter coldstorage months of the same year February March and April 103 per cent of the fresh beef placed in cold storage during the whole year was received into the warehouses in May March and April 81 per cent of the fresh mutton in May June and July 34 per cent of the dressed poultry in February March and April 27 per cent of the butter and in December January and February 14 per cent of the eggs The variations of seasonal production are little known by the general public They are not so large as is often supposed for pork butter and eggs The Cincinnati Price Current collects statistics 50PREVENTION OF WASTE AND PRICE FLUCTUATION of hog slaughter in the West and based on these statistics the mean monthly percentages of the annual slaughter for the nine years 19031911 are as follows beginning with January 107 9 75 72 87 93 77 67 61 73 92 106 total 100 From the records of 197 creameries properly distributed geographically ob tained from the Dairy Division of the Bureau of Animal Industry of the U S Department of Agriculture the following percentages of the years production of butter in 1910 have been computed beginning with January 64 55 68 79 11 125 106 96 92 79 65 61 total 100 For the purpose of this study all of the normal egglaying records that could be found have been consoli dated and the production of each month has been converted into a percentage of the annual total The percentages beginning with January follow 66 71 124 134 133 107 96 86 62 42 31 48 total 100 The length of time during which fresh beef mutton and pork and dressed poultry butter and eggs are usually carried in cold storage is a few months This fact is established by the reports of many warehouses which contributed the information summarized in this article Newspapers have led the public to believe that these foods are commonly stored during fabulous periods but the facts are as herein stated It is established that 712 per cent of the fresh beef received into cold storage in the year 19091910 was delivered within three months 288 per cent of the fresh mutton 952 per cent of the fresh pork 757 per cent of the dressed poultry 402 per cent of the butter and 143 per cent of the eggs Within four months after it was received 86 per cent of the fresh beef was delivered 427 per cent of the fresh mutton 965 per cent of the fresh pork 853 per cent of the dressed poultry 534 per cent of the butter and 226 per cent of the eggs The percentage of receipts delivered in seven months is 99 for fresh beef 993 per cent for fresh mutton 999 per cent for fresh pork 961 per cent for dressed poultry 884 per cent for butter and 758 per cent for eggs Lastly let the percentages for the deliveries of ten months be stated These are represented by 997 per cent for fresh beef 995 per cent for fresh mutton 999 per cent for fresh pork 989 per cent for dressed poultry 978 per cent for butter and 999 per cent for eggs There is always a carryover of these commodities into the next natural storage year due almost entirely to the reception into cold 51THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY storage near the end of the year While the principal portion of the receipts into cold storage during the year are found in certain months of relatively large production yet there are receipts during every month of the year and a large portion of those near the end of the storage year are carried into the next year From the natu ral storage year ending August 1910 96 per cent of the receipts was carried over to the next year in the case of fresh beef the per centage for fresh mutton for the natural storage year ending July 1910 was 151 per cent for fresh pork for the natural storage year ending April 1910 54 per cent for dressed poultry for the natural storage year ending July 1910 77 per cent for butter for the natu ral storage year ending April 1910 49 per cent and for eggs for the natural storage year ending February 1910 02 of 1 per cent In the investigation of cold storage by the writer for the U S Department of Agriculture some of the results of which are utilized in this article the warehousemen reported the receipts and deliver ies for each month of certain years and consequently it is easy to compute the average time of storage The fresh beef received into storage during the year beginning May 1909 was kept there on the average for 228 months the fresh mutton 445 months the fresh pork 088 of 1 month and the butter 443 months The dressed poultry received during the year beginning March 1909 was kept on the average 242 months the eggs 591 months If a portion of a product is withheld from consumption at a time of the year when production is relatively large and released for consumption at a time of the year when production is relatively small the academic logic of the proceeding is that prices will be raised during the period of natural surplus and depressed during the period of natural scarcity so that there will be in operation an equalizing force Prices should be more even through the year than they were at a time when there was a glut in one season and a scarcity in another To test this logic with facts it is necessary to establish the mean wholesale prices of the six commodities under discussion and such prices have been obtained for many cities of the United States and properly consolidated to form a single mean for each month from 1880 to 1911 This whole period is divided at 1893 and the price statistics of the preceding years have been consolidated to a 52PREVENTION OF WASTE AND PRICE FLUCTUATION single mean for each month for each commodity This period is distinctly an antecoldstorage period The coldstorage period beginning in 1893 and ending with 1911 is subdivided into two periods at 1902 for the purpose of making a group of the more recent coldstorage years during which the busi ness reached its highest development These three periods are re ferred to conveniently as the first second and third The mean prices established as already mentioned have been converted into index numbers by the process of using the mean monthly price of the year as a divisor and the price of each month as a dividend Index numbers so computed stand for relative whole sale monthly prices and avoid expression in dollars and cents A treatment of the problem by using prices expressed in money instead of in index numbers would thoroughly befog the matter for the reason that the purchasing power of money and also cost of pro duction and the relationship between demand and supply have changed It is only necessary to compare the mean relative prices of the index numbers for the first period with those for the third period to determine whether there has or has not been a tendency toward equalization of prices It is evident that if the prices for all of the months were the same the index numbers would all be 100 Every departure from uniformity of prices in cents is a corre sponding departure from uniformity of index numbers Let the first and third periods be compared for prices of fresh butter in New York as compiled by the UrnerBarry Company For 11 of the 12 months there was a tendency toward uniformity and for one month April a tendency away from uniformity of prices If the prices index numbers of the first period which stand for fresh butter are compared with those for coldstorage butter in the third period it is evident that for every one of the 12 months there was a tendency toward uniformity of prices The evidence for eggs is similar but not so strong A compari son of the first and third periods for fresh eggs finds a tendency toward uniformity of prices in 8 months and away from uniformity in 4 months and if the fresh eggs of the first period be compared with coldstorage eggs of the third period there is a tendency toward uniformity of prices in 10 months and away from uniformity in 2 months 53THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY Comparison may be made also for the consolidated prices com piled for many cities Comparison is made between the first and third periods and no coldstorage prices are included There are 13 monthly quotations for each year for the first of each month January 1 following the calendar year being included to round out the year For beef there was a tendency toward uniformity of prices for only 3 of the 13 months for mutton for 9 of the 13 months for pork for only 3 of the 13 months for dressed poultry for 8 of the 13 months for butter for 11 of the 13 months and for eggs for 9 of the 13 months The general fact may be regarded as estab lished that there was a tendency toward uniformity of prices for four of the commodities and that there was a contrary tendency for fresh beef and fresh pork The abnormal circumstances affect ing the slaughter of cattle and hogs in the third period very likely account for the apparent exceptions of fresh beef and fresh pork to the general fact of tendency toward uniformity of prices At any rate there is no evidence that the tendency away from uniformity of prices for fresh beef and fresh pork was due to anything done by the great packinghouses It is only by comparing the mean of a period of years with the mean of another period that the broad principle with regard to this matter can be established If two adjacent years are compared the results will differ more or less from those for the averages of periods of years as appears in the following comparison The period from October 1909 to October 1910 was a fairly normal one in the matter of production supply and price of butter and eggs but more or less abnormal with regard to fresh meats The year from October 1910 to October 1911 was abnormal for butter and eggs as well as for the other commodities There was a marked tendency toward inequality of prices from the former to the latter year in the case of beef pork butter and eggs and a tendency equally marked toward uniformity of prices in the case of mutton while in the case of poultry there was a perceptible but not pro nounced tendency toward uniformity of prices It is therefore apparent that the contention of the coldstorage interests that cold storage has counted for uniformity of prices is largely true but it is not true for all commodities nor for all com parisons of years and periods 54PREVENTION OF WASTE AND PRICE FLUCTUATION The problem is a complicated one and the factors are not all ascertainable or certainly not with definiteness That there should be a priori a tendency toward equalization of prices under the regime of cold storage in comparison with the antecoldstorage period has seemed a logical conclusion to many intelligent men and has been the contention of the coldstorage interests May it not be that the logic of the matter is disturbed by its human element by the psychology of trade The customer of the coldstorage warehouse who buys butter in June and places it in cold storage to be sold at some future time must receive a higher price per pound than he paid for it to cover costs and return him a profit The expectation that he will do so is solely the reason why he is engaged in the business It depends upon his judgment whenever any future time has become present time whether he will receive his highest rate of profit by selling now or by deferring sale until an other future time But all men who have bought butter and placed it in cold storage for future sale may or may not have the same judgment and herein may be found room for regularity or irregu larity of prices or a tendency toward or away from uniformity one year compared with another and one period of years compared with another COMMODITIES PLACED IN

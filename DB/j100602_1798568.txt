December 9 1868 Os the 7th of August 1866 I left Canton with Mr C L Weed photographer at Hong Song and Rev SIr Nevin of Canton on a journey into the interior of China Our course at first was westward for about 60 lniles to the head of the great delta of the Sikiang whose low fertile fields spread out widely along the riverbanks and support a most dense population Along the borders of these low lands rise serrated mountains some peaks attaining an elevation of 1500 to 2000 feet their sharp ridges and projecting spurs coming out in strong relief on account of the scanty vegetation on their sides This nakedness is a universal characteristic of the mountain scenery in Chirka but it is not the fault of the soil or the climate for wherever the little pines are allowed to rise they show a vigorous growth With proper care and labour the thousand hillsides in China might yield an abundance of timber and the lniserable mud houses of the poorer classes be replaced by neat structules of wood But in regard to the low lands it seems scarcely possible that they could be made to yield more than already raised two full crops being obtained in nearly every part of the empire The continued fertility of these lands is due no doubt chiefly to two causes first the Chinese are very careful to save everytlling that can possibly serve for manure irl some places even to the hair they shave from their heads and secondlyn tllese low lands are all or very nearly all subject to floods at least once a year and a deposit of fine land is thus spread out over them just as in the valley of the Nile Following up the Sikiang through a deep lass in the first nountain range ve canze to the city of Shauking where the Viceroy of Kwangtung arld K57angsi resided when the Portu guese first appeared

Over their whole surface they are extremely rough and jagged and filrrowed into perpendicular grooves wore by the small streams that pour down their sides in evel slight shower They form as striking objects in the level plain as the  Little Orphan  does in the waters of the Yangtse and like it have groups of little temples in the natural niches in their sides Larger temples are ranged at their feet alld one which we entered contained in the principal hall three great images of bronze 6 or 7 feet high In another room I noticed anidol with six arlns The hole building was going rapidly to decay and it was only after much searching that we succeeded in finding two poor monles preparing a scanty meal in the refectorythe last place tlley were willing to desert in the whole temple Climbing up a steep narrow stairway that rises diagonally xross the face of the precipice we reached a second tenlple perched high in a little nook Along a part of this stairway a rude heavy chain was fastened to the mountain side that the timid and weary might help themselves onward to the temples above and many must have been the pilgrims that ascended this difficult way if we are to judge from the depth of the places their feet have worn in the solid rock The entrance to the temple was through a crazy gateway or portal of loosened 13ricks which threatened to fall and immolate to its heathen god the first person who should set foot within it This templen we were informed was built some 200 years ago when Shaukiny was a great and flourishing city but now the poor priests call scareely beg enough from the people to supply their imlnediate ecessities and their once splendid temples are rapidly becolll ing merely heaps of ruins IIere as is frequently fotmd in masses of limestone are several caves We entered one of a bell shape Its floor was mostly covered with water and a bridge led us to a platform at the farther end As we were crossing this Stygian stream we were saluted with a fierce barking and indeed we did seem to be approaching the regions over which Cerberus presides but no other charln was necessaly for us to safely pass these canine guardians than a show of our canes Many tablets have been cut in the rock and along a stairway that led us to a picturesque temple where the cave opens to the sky on the opposite side During these excursions in the vicinity of Shauking both of my companions became quite 11 from the excessive heat the thermometer in the shade at noon risirlg to 98 Fahr and at my urgest solicitation tlley concluded to return and let me continue on alone E

of the noises and alarms that occurred ilequently all the wav to HankoN As ve slowly ascendecl the riTer by dint of poling tracking md sailing I had good opportullities to collect specimens of tlle

with me up the Rivel Kweikong or Cassia Uivern to lVweilin the capital of the province of Kwangsi It is so clangerous ascending this river oll account of X obbers that lsoats ollly leave NVuchau when sevelal are ready to go and call Leep together and afiford eaeh other mutual sssistance in case of an attack As an additional protectiony the Alandalin oWered to send a small gunlsoat alollg with us

the rocks when thev come down with the rapid current The plincipal article carried up this river in these boats is salt and as the Government monopolises the manufacture of this necessary article and tases and retases it at the most esorbitant rates the boatlnen improve every possible oppor tllnity to smuggle it from place to place into the interior We therefore made a special agreement that not a particle should be brought on board and were not a little astounded soon afterwards to find the captain trying to hide some among our baggage We very plainly informed him if it was left there it would go overboard and finally as near as I could ascertains he bought a permit for a part and smuggled through the rest This smuggling and cheating the Government is so common that I was repeatedly assured that the Mandarin boats which Eare not lialule to be searched from the fact that they carry officials never go up or down this river without inlprovillg every such opportunity to evade the Custom dues Every day ar two we came to a small house with two poles in front bearinr large triangular flags and there we were obliged to stop and allow the boat to be searched by fiercelooking fellows each armed with a long stick pointed with iron Tlle privilege of collecting tases at every place in the interior beillg given in reality to the highest bidder he has no scruples to reimburse llimself and leave a good surplus In this wav the people are squeezed until their discontent ripens illtO open rebellion NVhen an official is appointed over a city or district or province he receives llo instructiolls how he must act except to govern successfully and to govern with success in China means to extort the last cash possible from the people and yet not press them into open revolt At A5Tuchau I was credibly informed that between that city and anton a distance of 200 miles there were no less than ten places where duties are levied With such strictures in the great arteries of her trade all rapid progress in China is beyorld hope Ascending this river is little else than dragging a boat up one continued series of rapids and though ours drew but 5 or 6 inches it seemed sornetimes that the boatmen would not be able to get her along any farther This shows how shallow the water is at that season of the year and also the unfortunate fact that steamers can never be used on the river The boatmen at Wuchau reckon on fourteen days to reach Sweilin and four to return For the first 100 miles we passed only small scattered villages54 BICKBIORE S Sketch of a Jotlrneyfrom each having on the top of the llithest hill near it a fort where they keep their e2ctra rice and clothitlg for every village pillages every other village alld all that pass whenever they dare These fortified hilltops reminded us of the pictures of the midde ages given us by historians but these people are subject to even less law and order than those of those early tinles for hele each man seems grasping for hilnself and there they did acknowledge an allegiance to some lord and obeyed his com mand As an illustration of the conlplete state of anarchy th4 obtains throughout this whole region I lnay state that on nz thircl day from Wuchau we met a large Mandarill boat that had been robbed of everything the first night aftel leaving KweilL the ofFozals evell not being able to escape the hands of these desperate thieves As we passed on from place to placte the Mandarins were all very kind to us Iut kept asking how we could dare to come away there so far into the interior that only one foreigner had ever been befolle artd who as they said though he escaped aliare through Ewangsi was lnurdered by the people of fIunaim They 1seferred to an eccentric genius who did reach Hankow but was stripped even of his clothing Beyond the city of Chauping the country becomes SQ what more cultivated yet it is spalsely peopled and there is no need that a single man should leave China in order to find a plenty of good land to cultivate The river here flows through deep passes and we entered ore called the Forest Pass as the bright day was darkening illto twilight The rock was a hard silicious grit and sharp peaks rose up to a height of 1600 or 1700 feet Like the famous Shauking Pass this is also a cleft in a mountain range bxA while that is about 600 yards wide this is only from 50 to 150 and as we sailed along under these high ovelhanging precipiws the seenic effect was far glander than anything else I enjoyedL ill Chilla As night overtook us while yet in the deep pass we uloored our boat to some huge rocks by the steep bGzak and then climbed to the edge of a neighbourino ridge and waited to see the full moon whose soft light was just brigttening the ease sky And hen her silver clisl rose ovel the

limestone apparently resting on the grits and slates previously mentioned In the shady places were large quantities of a beautiful blue convolvulus in full bloom of the same species as specimens Mr Graves had frequently found in the limestone caves near Shauking Our daily routine was to walk in the forenoon until the sun got high and again in the afternoon until the boat reached a safe anchorage Mr Graves gathering plants and sketching a map of the river and the writer collecting specimens of the rocks ascertaining the dip of the strata and the direction of the elevations details too numerous to be given in this paper On the evening after leaving Pinglo we were bllowing the riverbank as it bent round a high bluS when we suddenly found ourselves on the edge of a valley solne ten miles broad and extending to the right and left farther than we could see In every direction it was perfectly brzstEtng with sharp peaks of limestone The strata of this limestone were nearly horizontal and once the whole valley was filled with solid rocl which in the course of ages has been worn by running streams into deep channels that have kept widening until only sharp peaks are left From a single position on the low riverbank I counted 192 separate peaks The highest rose I judge to a height of 1200 feet above the plain but even this did not represent the whole depth of the deposit On the low land they were culti vating rice indigo peanuts sugarcane millet and cotton and their lightgreen colours contrasted sharply with the dark rocks rising abruptly from the level plain and made the whole view the most peculiar and most picturesque seen on the journey Similar views are given in Sir Roderick Murchisons  Russia and the Ural hIoulltains and in sAtkinsons Travels of the scenery among the contorted and fractured Devonian limestones on the banks of the Tchussovaya on the western flanks of the Ural and it is probably to this same Devonian period that these lirnestones and those previously mentioned belong On passing out of this marble region a section mras found a little above the marketplace Hingping where the limestone was seen resting conformably as near as I could judgeon the grits that at Sokhan had been found in turn resting on granite Nearer Kweilin the country is more open and better culti vated and large waterwheels 20 or 30 feet in diameter are frequently seen along the riverbanks wherever the rapids are strong enough to keep them movillg Pieces of bamboo areBICEMORES Sketch of a Journey from fastened diagonally to tlle rim and bring up the water

a huge hole were pointed Ollt by our boatmen as indications that we were nearin the capital of the province of Kwangsi Instead of being situated on the west side of a considerable lake as represented on the latest maps we found it on the west side of the river which in the rainy season probably overfloTs its low banks and thus gives rise to the mistake The walls of the city are of blocks of limestone neatly cut and above a parapet of bricks NVe carefully closed opr boat to prevent any one from seeing us and in the evening rowed up to the citar I at once des patched my boy to the Yamun to show my pass from the Vice roy at Canton and ask for chairs and policemen to protect me to the next city for Mr Graves was thell to return and I must make my way as best I could for 800 miles farther unable to speak six words of the language myself and with no other inter preter or companion than a boy from Canton All arrangeinents could not be made till the next day mean while we kept out of sight but in some way they found xve had come and early the next nlorning all the streets housetops ancl boats near us were packed with people ansious to get a sight at the foreigners At first we tried to avoid them by moving from place to place darting hither and thither like a bird trying to escape frorn a hawk but we met a crowd everywhere and con cluded the best way was to go out on the front part of the boat and exhibit ourselves by turns to the curious public hen one throng had satiated their curiosity they generally left us but they were imtnediately replaced by one still larger until it seemed as if a11 the Chinamen south of the Great Wall had come out to gaze at us In the midst of this tumult my boy arrived from the Yamun and stated all was ready and the Man dal in said that if I was going to Hankow I should depart at once for the whole city had been set into a periectfrore by a pro clamation from the gentry and he feared we should be attacked by so many he might not be able to defend us a statement we well knew was only too true 3Ir Graves kindly translated the proclamation for me as follows  It has a7ready been detertnined by comrnon consent hat if any one has

perish in the attempt A great crowd gathered on the shore where I landed alld the lvoys hooted and shouted but I coulA not understand what they said and ouly hurltied on my chair coolies thiough the suburbsS which were everywhere perfectly throIlged Two or three times I feared they 70uld block up the street before me and thus stop me completely but they seemed to have a suspicious respect for the barbarian and allowed me to pass When we came to the chief gate and wele entering the cityn some offlciaIs stopped my chair and drew me into their office from the press of the clowd while they were telling my coolies to take me round the cityR and not throllgll it And to increase this dangelous delay one of my chair coolies ran away and it was a long time before another could be found but I finally continlled on between the city wall and the river until we came to a high rook rotlnd which we were ferried in a boat and once more I was freed from ny tormentors It was cerXinly with no small delight that I ralked and was thus able to hurry on my chairbearers and with all possible haste quit this city of destruction Night howeverS overtook us when we were only five miles away and the two policemen guarding us selected an ina in a little village where we took lodgings for the night After such a tempest it was so pleasant to be allowed to rest a few moments in peace and I considered myself so safe from any harm that I tas tempted to wander out a little way irlto a neighbouring field to note by the aid of an asimuth compass the direction of the valley we were to travel in on the morrow and the form of the mountains on either side While I was absorbed in the beautiful ariew before me a man passed by and glanced suspiciously at the operl compasS so I shut it up and went back to rest But  presentiment that all my troubles were not passed kept me awake till late in the evening xvhen suddenly the whole village begall to resound with a heavy beating of gongs and immediately came a great rabble bearing torches and shouting out sc izA hirn  72Z1Z hzn   kilZ the white devil r    I plaillly sawmean cowards that they were that they had come to rob me and thell kill me and I feared the worst but my two policemen were ffithful for they knew they would be sure to lose their heads if I came to any harin and it should be reported to Peking They therefore showed tlle ringleader my pass frozn his own mandarin and assured58 BICKMORES Sketch of a Jous ney from theln all that if they injured me in the least the mandalin would behead them to a man and destroy every house in the plaee and after muel loud and angry dlsputing they oWered to leaxre me on eondition that I sllollld go on at the ealliest clawn The only erime alleged atillst me mas that one of their number had seen

notion is that a foreigner who has blue eyes eertainly has the elairvoyant power of seeing straight through any quantity of solid roek SeSt 3rdAt daylight we started up the valley to the north east the general direetion of tlle Kweikong above Eweilin The road or more properly path was only 3 or 4 feet wide and paved with bloeks of limestone or eobblestolle froin the neighbouring river Great numbers of eoolies wele passing to and fro this being one of the four great highvays between the southern part of the empire and the valley of the Yangtse The others are 1 that from the provinee of IVwantung over the Great Meiling Pass into the provinee of Kiangsi and down the Kan River to the Poyang Lake 2 anotller also up the Pehkiang or North River to Shauellau and in a northwest direetion up a small streala to Loellang and over the Lesser Bleiling Pass to Ching and down a small river to Eangthau in Eulan and 3 one from Yunnan the capital of the province of that nalne to liwel yang the capital of Kweichau and thellce down the Wu to the Yangtse At 10 AM the road came to a slnall tributaly of the Wweikonge COBling ill from a range of high mountains on the northwest On each side of this stream there had once been a arge flight of marble steps nicely cut and carefully laid up but now thev are all fallilag apart and the whole work going to decay the amount of travel at present not being sufficient even to keep them in repair and such was the condition of all the public works throughout that region Crossing to the opposite bank we came to a slnall square tower and near it were two ilon pillars surmounted by a large ornalnental cap Around each was an iron ring to which were attached a series of huge chains large enough for a sea junk The people3 said they were to fasten robbers toperhaps the Miautse who live ill the neighbouring mountains to the north and nortJlwest and are said to come down frequently and plunder the sluallet villages ill the neighbourlloodCanton to Hankow 59 But notwithstanding this great show of absolute power these Miautse have to this day maintained an uninterrupted indepen dence a ploof of the weakness of the Chinese Government in every dynasty At 2 PM stopped to lunch at a little inn The policemen insisted on my going illtO a small room and remaining there out of sight till we were ready to start again and after that all the nvay to Hankow I was so closely attended and so strictly guarded that I found myself really a prisoner I could not make long detotlrs to the right or left as we passed objects of much interest yet I can scarcely complain for such measures were undoubtedly necessary for my safety By compass I car ried under my vest and I looked at it only when vve were at some distance from any village and the road was clear of coolies yet even my boy thollght it was his duty to frequently remind me of the trouble it had just caused us and besides when I used it often my policetnen with whotrL it was absolutely neces sary for me to keep on good terlus plainly manifested a suspicion that I was a spy Yet as we followed along near the Kweikong and crossed two of its tributaries and the main stream itself I was able to complete Mr Graves map across the watershed with considerable accuracy and thus solve one of the queries I pro posed to myself on leaving Canton namely Is there a water communication between the valley of the Siang and that of the Yangtse  2 PMCame to Lingsun a hien city 60 li 20 miles from Kweilin A sickening sensation closely akin to fear came over me as I entered its gate and thought how I had been treated at the last city but the oflicials at the Yamun seemed to regard me with pity rather than hate and I tried to return their kindness by lronouncing as well as I could the names of the chief places aloIlg my route atld marking out a rude map on the wall and thus giving them some idea of where I llad cotne from and where I wanted to go But the policemen feared a mob might gather again and led me away to a dirty inn where every room was full but one and on one of the two beds in that an old opium smoker lay stretched out nearly stupified with his favourite drug The room was properly more of a dungeon than a guest chambel A single piece of glass in the roof which was little higher than our heads admitted all the light we were suSered to enjoy But my companion at least seemed blissfully in diSerent to the inconveniences of our prison and no doubt was imagining himself floating on clouds in the high air or in some richly gilded barge gliding down Lethes stream whose waters he hacl celtainly drunk to satietv Several slnall boys climbed6V BICKMORE s Sketch of a Journey from up the paltitions to peep over and steal a view at the odd personage inside but I hacl become accustomed to such rude ness After three hours more we continued on and passed out at the eastern gate The whole city is one heap of ruins and there are scarcely enough houses left to line the single main street so complete is the destruction made by the Taipings In fact all the way frotn Shauking I had come almost exactly in the track of those rebels and theil hordes were composed of just such murderers and robbers as I found there Their leacler was undoubtedly stimulated to his undertaking by chagrin at not being able to zass the governulent examination and it would be strange if a luan whose prime nzotive was to take revenge on his government should care much about elevating his countrymen It is true he and his confederates lvere friendly to foreigners and invited them to take part with them in trying to drive out the Manchus but I believe it was only because they were weak and needed assistance and that if they had once gained the supreme authority they would have been as hostile to foreigners as the present dynasty and a proof of this is the reserved manner oi thei1 chief as soon as he had taken Nanking and believed the whole empire within his grasp Tllis territory whele the  Great Peace lebellion started and the territory too that they held the longest is the most despoiled the most dangerous and the most unprolaising of any I have seen in China and it has been my privilege to travel over a very large part of the elllpire Revolution after ltevolu tion has swept back ancl folth over tlle whole lengtll and breadth of China until her soil has recldened in every part with the blood of tens nay hundreds of millions of her people and yet she remains just where she was two thousand years ago simply because all these movements have been originated by men like the Taipings lvhose only aim was to obtain the throne or to plunder or to avenge personal wrongs and not by men who were filled with a lofty alabition to benefit their native land and who were willing and desirous if need be to sacrifice their lives and all they possessed for the attainment of such a noble end The plain surrounding Lingsun appeared vely fertile and was periectly dotted with large stacks of rice which the farmers were just gathering A walk of 35 li brought us to Taiunggong a small village on the Kweikong or Cassia River for the water still flows slowly towards Kweilin Before we reached it we crossecl a small stream flowing into the Kweikollg from the north There we saw many rafts of bamboos to be floated down toCanton to BankoC 61 Kweilin and Wuchau In its bed I lloticed pebbles of granite and porphyry but a11 the rocks seen tn sttqb were the common silicious grits The valley here is nearly filled with small hills but in this place only Among them I gathered a beautiful bluebell much like that found on our hill sides in New England A kind of blackberry that grew in the old ruins by the road side was just ripening and the opening of the asters also heralded the coming of autumn as at home I had chosen just the right time for this journey for there is much less danger of being robbed and murdered when it is harvest time and the people are not suSering from want of food The nest day we travelled 55 li to the district city Hingan The water here flows to the north alld the svatershed is a few li to the southwest but a canal connects the iKweikong and the Siang which has been made in the following lnanner The east and west chain of mountains in some parts called the Meiling Range and in others the Nanling Range is here com posed of separate ranges which instead of estending east and west run parallel to each other in a direction N 60 E and s 60 w The Kweikong takes its rise near the northern end of one valley while the source of the Siang is at the southern end of the adjoining valley and for some distance these streams have their channels nearly parallel to each other while they flow in opposiZe directions It was only necessary to malie a canal between the two at right angles to their courses and the com lnunication was complete This was done near the source of tlle Eweikong for previously only a very slight elevation pre vellted the water at that place froln flowing into the Siang  But tllis canal can only be used during the rainy season and then llot for boats drawing more than 2 feet The water is kept in the canals by building dams across them wherever a rapid would occur and allowing the water to escape only through a sleall gap deep enough for a single boat to pass over If there nTere large reservoirs along this part of the canal to receive the surplus water during the wet season and pour it out during the dry season boats could pass to alld from weilin and Slrlchau throughout the year But the cllief difficulty is not near the watershed which is really on a plateau but in the many strong and dangerous rapids that occur all the way down the Cassia lAiver from Kweilill to Wuchau on the one side and froln lingan

or two li They are nzade with a gap for the boats by one banlt and by the other a sluiceway where as many as ten huge waterwheels were sometimes seen one behind the other It seelned that there were many more rapids in the 14 leagues from Taukatse to Sinchau than in 16 leagues from Sweilin toward NVuchau on the other side of the watershed Through the province of Kwangs one or two policemen attended us from one city to the next carrying a large letter from their Mandarin informing the people we were travelling with the permission of the Government and requesting them not to trouble or annoy us in any way When we reached the city before us this paper was signed by the Mandarin and returned to the policemen as a proof they had fully pelzformed their duty and were flee from any farther responsibility But in Hunan I was always accompanied by one civil Mandarin and one policeman and for most of the way by a military Mandarin and from two to four soldiers besides a guard no larger than the sequel proved I needed So far as my experience estended these people certaillly sustained their ullenviable reputation of being the most lawless and tlle most openly hostile to foreigners of those of any province in the enzLpire Sinchau is the chief city in tlliS legion and appeared nearly as large as Wuehan yet it is not seell even on the best maps Again all this area for

days from E3inchau we reached Wiyang which is situated on the riverbank and not some distance back of it as given on the maps Below this city the whole country becomes thickly populated and well cultivated and the tetnples outside the cities which were all destroyed by the Taipings appeared everywhele newly built and contrasting favourably with the ominous condition of such buildings in every other part of the empire and indicating the high prosperity of the people by whose contributions they are built They are so numerous and form such a prominent feature in every scene along the Siang that Hunan mav properly be styled the province of temples and the stronghold of 13uddhism Eight or ten li below Siyang in one place on the right bank limestone strata were seen resting unconformably on other limestone strata as if the upper layers belong to a diCerent folation The lower limestone had the jointed and fissured appearance of that previously seen resting on the grits and slates 84 li below Kivang at the village of Pinchaboo we passed a hill of limestone interstratified with coal They were quarrying the limestone and using the coal obtailled at the same time to burn it to lime Dip of these strata 40 to the north and a little farther in that direction carne red sandstone with similar dip of 15 to 20 September 16th Stopped for the night at a little village 165 li above IIangehau As we arrived after dark no one saw lne and I was left lmmolestecl All the evening there was even more loud talking and disputing than I llad been accustozned to heal and the whole village appeared to have indulged rather freely m samshoo Before we pushed off to anchor as usual in the streanl my servant asked the Mandarin if he would like to take a walk along the front street but he only shook his head in an olainous manner and replied  they are all ruffians there About 10 oclock very loud and excited talking and disputing began on the bank near us and soon one of the nulater commenced screaming and groaniDg as if lle haci received his cleath wound Immediately his murclerers brouOht him aown the bank put him into a small boat and paddled by us out into the stream their victim all the time trounin g lllore and more feebly and evidently dying My servant who had been calzefully watchinS and listening said these lYlen llad first robbed him and when he cried for llelp they had stabbed hiln and they64 BICKMORES Sketch of a Journey from were just then finishing their worlz by sinking him in the river I found we had thus run directly into a nest of the assassins that prowl through the country but I trusted no one had seen rne for that was my only chance of escaping the same fate There was nothing I could do but keep perfectly quiet so as not to attract their attention and have the boat start as soon as it silould be light enough for us to avoid the rocks in the rapids I opened the lid of my revolver box and determined when the event came to sell my life as dearly as I could but after listening for many long lovely hours I finally fell asleep and when I awoke agaill we xvere quietly floatillg down the rapid stream and this village of robbels was far out of sight behilld us NVe soon passed Sichang 145 li above Hangehau This is the principal coal mine on tlle Siang and some fifty boats were then loading for places down that river and along the Yangtse Here a fine section was obtained showing that the coalbeds rest on limestone which is also the case in Szchuen near PelSing and probably iol every part of the empire urhere both occur As we were but six miles from the village where the murder just described had occllrred the civil hIandarill sent to protect lue declared he would not allow nle to land and examine the mines for a moment and I could therefore only note what was to be seen from the river as we passed  The mines that thus came in new were nothing snole than deep pits in the sides of the hills and consequelltly only  surface coals  are obtained It is probably to be expected that better coal would occur below the waterlevel but as soon as they come to water they are obliged to gixre up working a mitle for lvant of proper pumping apparatus The best coal ill hina therefore remains to be talien out The engineers in the stealuers on the Yangtse assure me it has ilnproved very decidedly in quality since the first was brought to theln but I doubt lvhether it will ever equal the best coals of England or America Hangehau is the great depot for coal in Hwlan and tlle military Mandarin who accompanied me from that city to Changslla the capital of the prowince stated that coal is also znined at Eweiyang and Saiyant see Dr Williams map of China and at Siuhwa oll Tsz lViang It probably occurs therefole everywhere beneatll the red sandstone tllat covers the wide plains in this plosince but it is only mined where it outcrops on the borders of those plains From this lJillage of Sichallg in Hunan to Moukden north of the Gulf of Liautung thele is a continued series of coalCanton to Zankow 65 mines on the flanks of the elevations that fornz the westerll border of the GUreat Plain alld the wide distribution of such a mineral promises well for the future development of China The most important place for trade in Hunan is Sangtau 90 li south of Changsha All the boats that corne down the numerous branches of the Siang malie this the point of rendezvous and there is water enough for small steamers from ISankow unless a shallow occurs where tllis river empties into the Tullgting Lake That place I passed by night and had no opportullity of examilling  At Siangyin we found there was such a great flood in the valley of the Yangtse that we were already on the border of the lake though according to the snap it ought to have bee dry land for 20 miles farther When we reached the lake a heavy lortherly wind had beell blowing for sis or seven days and felv or no boats had crossecl it during that time A southerly breeze then set in and all the boats that had been haliouring in the many creeks and bays came out on to the lake and at sunrise I enjoyed a view onlv to be seen in this land whose population is numbered by the hundred million As ftlr as the eye could see before us and be hind us and for several miles on either side the surMace of the lake was perfectly featllered aJitll wllite sails sorne in sunshine SOllle ill sllaclow and some in the dim distance apparently gliding on a thin Slm of air over the xvater Twice I counted nearly 44 boats in sight at one tinze and witll the aid of uly Seld glass fully 100 lnore could le distinuished Mariy were loaded with tea many with coal and many relle just swimming along under lluge deck loads of rollnd timber Tllis shows the amount of carrying trade between Siangtau witll Changsha and Yohchau and Efankow and other cities down the Yangtse It also indi cates that Siangtau is the ulost important city up the Yangtse that is not yet open to foreign trade This lake is very shallow along its eastern side and probably over its xvhole area and its basin is lnerely the lowest part in the great depression that forms the valley of the Siang It is rapidly filling up with the sediment brought dovvn the Siang and the Yangtse The Poyang Lake is of the same character It has bee moticed that each has near it a group of high mountains This is only another way of stating that where there has been an unusual elevation there has been a corresponding depressio near it Below Tohchau a llumber of lakes occur whicll Pere Huc describes as abounding in floating islands where the people are obliged to live because the surrounding country is SO overpopu VOL XNXVIII v66 BICKMORE S Sketch of a Journey from lated but I saw none and others xvho had been to alld fro over most of this area assured me they had never seen anything of the knd Oct 5th After 60 days of continued travelling I reached lIankoxv the distance by the route I had chosen being about 1200 lYliles For 35 days I had lived like a common coolie as I had only oile man to carry my own and my servants clothing durillg the land journey and what food we should want for two or three days for we expected to be able to get nothing to eat near Kweilin after the gentry had published such a proclaulation Frequently for llearly half a day at a time vvhile we were waiting for the mwandarins at the cities I had to lie among the cargo with a straw mat over me fearfully cramped yet not able to stir that I might thus escape a repetition of what had occurred at Kweilin The mandarins never seemed contented until they had packecl me away in that fashion Yet they were always very kincl and for some distance they came to call on me and be satisfied that a foreigner had really come up into their courltry At Yohchau the Mandarin would not believe I llad come from Canton and even hacl the impoliteness to say it X7as much more probable I had come up the Yangtse from Shalaghai or Hankow until he had seen theseal of tlhe Vieeroy of Wssangtullg ancl Swangsi 13esicles learning soznething of the physical geogralhy of this UllkYlOWn part of the empire this journey was 1lndertaken with the hope of being able to trace the succession of the geological forlnations of that region In a country where there are no railroads Ol great excavations perhaps the channels of the rivers afforfl oIle of the best opportunities for this purpose ancl as the water was everywhere very low it was only necessary to float along ill a boat near the banks and the strata could be examinecl and followed contlnuously for miles Sections were pen cilled aet the most interesting pOilltS and tllev show the succession in the territoly through which mTe canae toXe 7irst and 70wes

linwestone stratcz of the sarne age as the coat rooks alld fifAy these later limestones and coal becls are covered in turn by red sandstone The route taken froln Canton to fIankow is the one proposecl for a railroad between those cities oll account of the large trade between Canton ancl ATuchau lout I suggest that possibly a more desirable route may be froln Canton up the North River to Sbavlellaun and thence along a small strearll ill a northCanton to Hankow 7 westerly direction to Loucheung and over the  Lesser teiling Pass to Ching and dowll a branch of the Siang to Hangehau provided this pass is not so higll as to make deep cuttings or tumlelling necessary All such difficulty would certainly be avoided by extending the line as proposed southerly from Hang chau to Kweilin and Wuchau and in proof of this I may state that if I had left Canton in the rainy season I could have gone by this route all the vvay round to Shanghai in one and the sclne boat The seasorl in which I came was not only a  dry season lout admitted by all to be  rernarkabty dry season and yet if the gentry of Kweilin had not prevented me from gettillg a boat at that city I could then have continued on to Lingsun and when I reached Taiunggong only 35 li 11 lniles furtller I found some boatInen pushing their boats along to Hingan but not as fast as I could go by land Froln Haakow to Canton via Kweilin tllere is no physical feature whatever that will render the construction of a railroad a work of any greater difficulty than in any very hilly country but there is very little trade between Hangehau and Kweilicl and Sweilin and Wuchau mThile there appears to be very considerable trade between Hangthau and tlle province of Kwangtung bytthe route I suggest This way over the Lesser Pwieiling Pass was tbe one in which all the teas from the province of Hunan and Wweichau were trarls ported to Canton when that was the only open port and whell  I was at Hangehau the mandarins and boatmen all agreed that all their trade at present with the province of Swangttmg wsas carried in this old channel which as they said would have taken me but half as long as the one I had prefelsred that I might see a new part of the enpire They also affirmed that there nas no water commllnication between the source of the branch of the Siang near Ching and the source of the branch of the North XEtiver at Louclleung on the southern side of the watershed MThile there are immenso quantities of goods to be trans ported in every directioIL and such rlatural facilities for building a railroadn great obstacles to such a work will be found in the bittels hostility of the people to all foreigners and in their super stitious fears  Frillgshui that any high building or exca vation  will aSect the winds and rain and deluge their ClOpS With floods or parch them with heat The prexralence of this belief among the Chinese and the estent to which it influences their actiolas is most surprising All over the empire deserted quarries of limestone and sandstone are seenn and lead and other  mlnes except coa  are generally not worked 0n inquiring tlle cause of this the inxrariable reply is  It has been closed by order of the EInperor  but in pressing the anatter further I  n  aare tound 1n every case except one that this imperial edict F 268 BICEMORES Sketch of a Journey from Cantorz to Baslkow was made in this way When a man eommenees an exeavation the surrounding eommunity draw up a petition that this mall should not lSe allowed to ruill their erops It is then hancled to the emperor who not daring to oppose the will of the majority a eondeseellding manner orders the petition to be granted ancl thus while he plays the part of the absolute monareh he is really a supple slave And this shows llow mueh proteetion a railroad eompany or a telegrapll eompany ought to expeet and hosnr muth they woulcl eelqtaillly find in the present Government Again the great nu nbers who are llOW dependent on the earry ing tlade for a livelihood xvoulcl lJe likely to interfere with any such work and perhaps destroy it altogether when they found it taking away their only rneans of supporting theanselves The argumellt that sueh people would filld plenty of employment in building the road and taking eare of it is partly met at least by tlle faet that the Chinesfe are slow to ehange their habits and the boat people generally dislike to live on the land lnueh less to lvorli on it We therefore eome to tile eonelusion that there is no eneou rageineilt for either foreign or lative capitalists to attempt to build a railroad in that land ulltil tle Government will not ollly freely give permission for sueh a work but also can and quilt guarantee to proteet the loadS or fully lnake up any damage the people may do to it NVllen this happy day for China arrives it is as eertaill that railroads there will pav as that mer ehallts now find it profitable to run steamers on the Yallgtse and Canton rivers and along the sea eoast Besides the watels eommunieation between the valley of the Sikiang and the Yangtse described above it has been supposed that another might be found by

llear lVweihwa or Vgaushun and so doxvn to the Yangtse At first I proposed taking this route but decided on the one chosen on account of its being that proposed for a railroad and because it was nearer the seaboard and therefore more ilumediately interesting llhe topography of Hunan and the eastern part of Swangsi lDeing now quite well known it reluains for some one to take this second route

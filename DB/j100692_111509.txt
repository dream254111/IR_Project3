Ethyl,i207051,309 XIII 1 Further Remarks on the Organometallic Radicals and Observations more particularly directed to the isolation of Mlercuric Plumbic and Stannic Ethyl By GEORGE BOWDLER BUCKTON Esq FRS Received June 17 1858 Before again entering on the subject of the organometals the autihor wishes to call attention to the remarks he has previously made on the difficulties which presented themselves at that time in the preparation of mercuric ethyl Secondary decompositions induced by the nature of the materials employed and the high temnperature necessary to the reaction showed themselves even in the more easily prepared mercuric methyl and reduced the quantity obtained considerably below that pointed out by theory The loss suistained in the similar operation of distilling together eyanide of potassium and iodide of mercitrous ethyl C4 H5 Hg2 I is yet more marked and it may be rememnbered that the portion obtained did no more than suffice for a cursory examination of its most marked characters A new mode of operating was therefore desirable and it was not long before the following considerationis presented themselves The powerful and welldefined affinities of zincethyl have already furnished a valuable key to the explanation of several chemical problems anid seem to be well suited for experiment in the present case Bearing in mind its wellknown reactions on water and hydro chloric acid there appeared to be wellgrounded reasons for supposing that interesting decompositions might be effected with various oxides chlorides and iodides Through the instruimentality of zincethyl the author has succeeded in isolating in a neat and efficient manner several of the organo metals and he indulges a hope that they may when taken as starting points of investigation prove of service in fixing exact formulhe to somue of those bodies the composition of whichl at present appear doubtful from their complexity Action of Zineethyl oni Mercuric Chloride Corrosive suLblimate acts with great eniergy on zincethyl so mullcIch  Phil Trans Roy Soc Proc Roy Soc vol ix p 91310 so ais to render it necessary to cool the apparatus in water and add the welldried salt by degrees An excess of the latter must be avoided since chloride of mercurous ethyl would be formed as was formerly shown to be the case in the methyl series After the two bodies have been brought together in their proper proportions heat is applied and the radical passes over by distillation as a heavy colourless and nearly inodorous liquid the slight excess of zincethyl is then decomposed by the addition of water arid just sufficient dilute hydrochloric acid added as will dissolve the preci pitated oxide of zilnc The two transformations may be seen in the equations C4 H5 Zn Hg Cl C4 Ha Hg Zn Cl and again C4 11o Hg Hg Cl C4 CH Hg Cl The pure radical boils at a temperature between 158 and 1600 C It burns readily with a luminous and somewhat smoky flame with disengagement of mercurial vapour It is almost wholly insoluble in water Alcohol dissolves it rather sparingly but it mnixes freelv with ether The behaviour of acids towards miercuric ethyl is strictly analogous to that shown by niercuric methyl With dilute acid there is but little change but warm concentrated hydrochloric or sulphuric acid liberates hydride of ethyl in sufficient qtuantity to permit of its inflammationi through a gas jet The salts of mercurous ethyl remain in solution The specific gravity of a specimen boiling between 158 and 1600 C  was founnd to be 2444 and the same sample when submitted to analysis gave numbers agreeing accurately with the forinula C4 H5 Jg The correctness of this fornmula was further confirmed hy an appeal to the vapourdensity The first experiment failed fromu the circumstance that the vapour decomposes with a slight explosion when heated a few degrees above 205 C In this experiment metallic mercury was deposited on the walls of the glass balloon as a grey film and the other contents consisted of an inflammable gas Mercuric methyl appears therefore to be resolved at this temperature into ethyl gas and mercury311 Another experiment was mrore successful and gave the number 9 97 for the vapourdensity The equivalent weight of mercuric ethyl is 129 which beinlg 129 divided by the former figures gives 5  91294 If the constituents of this radical be condensed into two volumes of vapour the more accurate number 1486 should have been obtained The theoretical density of mercuric ethyl thus calculated is equal 129 to 1486 868 This portion of the subject would be incomplete unless a few words were added on the behaviour of zincethyl towards mercurous chloride It has been mentioned that all attempts to reduce iodide of mer curous methyl to the form of a radical containiing one equivalent of nethyl and two equivalents of mercury have hitherto failed Reasoning a priori we should not expect to find a departure in the present case neither does such appear Mercurous chloride reacts with vigour on zinlcethyl but metallic mercury is formed simnultaneously with chloride of zinc and mercuric ethyl The decompositions of mercurous and mercuric chlorides or iodides are thus shown C4 H Zn Hg2 ClC4 HI Hgg Zn Cl Hg and C0 4I Zn llg ClC4 H Hg Zn Cl Having succeeded by these simple means in effecting a replacement in zincethyl through the ordinary metallic chlorides there remained yet one point unltouched viz the behaviour of various organo metallic salts under similar treatment First in order was tried  Here it is fitting to menition an error that has crept into the calculation of the vapourdensity of mercuric methyl as it appears printed in the  Proceedings of the Royal Society A false figure in the denominator of one of the fractions causes the experimental density to appear as 1486 whereas the true experimenital density observed was 829 The theoretical density of mercuric methyl calculated for two volumes equals 1 6 795312 The Action of Zinicethyl on Iodide of Mercurous Ethyl Carbolnic acid or ordinary coalgas was slowly passed through the neck of a retort and when the atmospheric air was displaced about two ounces of zincethyl nearly free from ether and wholly so from iodide of ethyl was introduced Iodide of mercurous ethyl was then added by degrees through the tubulure and the whole mixed by agitation The zincethyl at first dissolves the iodide but subsequently a cake of iodide of zinic is formed Distillation was then commenced the heat being raised by degrees until gaseous products appeared The distillate after being well washed was rectified by the thermometer and in this manner the radical was obtained in a state of purity Iodide of mercurous ethyl may be formed so easily by diffused day light and its action is so gentle on zincethyl that its use offers greater conveniences to the operator than are afforded by any of the substances previously mentioned For obvious reasons a similar choice of materials is recommended for preparing mercuric methyl Action of Zincethyl on Chloride of Lead The close relatiolns which exist between the three metals lead mercury and silver in their equivalent weights salts and other clharacters lead the author to anticipate success in forming their ethyl bases The existence of the lead radlical nmight indeed be considered as certain since various salts of complicated structure have been made known to chemists through the experiments of M Lowig on the alloy of lead and sodium ulder treatment with iodide of ethyl I The principal product obtained by him and the only one appa rently analysed had a grouping simnilar to a sesquichloride The formuila ascribed by him to the radical plumbethylium is Pb2 C4H53 I have attempted to form the iodide of this radical by exposing sealed tubes colntaininig granulated lead and iodide of ethyl to the suns rays but without success No better result was obtaiined by substituting bromide of ethyl for the iodide and no change could be induced evTen when these tubes were heated stronglv witlh high pressure steaii M L6wigs mnethod was not resorted to fromn the suilpositiou that the action of zincethyl on a mixtutre would only give sise to riadicals of313 various constitution which it might be impossible afterwards to separate except by working on a large scale which considering the costliness of the materials had its disadvantages Perhaps success might attend the use of one of Dr Franklands mirrors for concen trating the suns rays For obtaining the leadradical recourse was had to welldried chloride of lead which was introduiced into a flask containing zinc ethyl The chloride immediately turned black from the deposit of metallic lead whilst moderate heat was disenigaged An excess of chloride was used and the mass incorporated by stirring with a glass rod After applying a gentle heat for a few minutes the floating clear liquid was pipetted off This substance is apparently a compound of zincethyl and the lead radicals It fumes slightly in the air and no digestion with chloride of lead appeared to resolve it enitirely into the lead base A great part of the zincethyl however is removed by subsequent distillation  but the temperature should not be permitted to rise above 1400 or 1500 C The substance in the retort is then treated with water and dilute hydrochloric acid when the radical separates and sinks in the form of colourless drops When distilled cautiouslv the thermometer soon rises to 200 but beyond this point the vapour is very prone to decomposition with deposit of metallic lead From this tendency to change there is some difficulty in obtaining the substanice wholly pure from bodies with lower boilingpoints The larger portion came over between 1980 to 202 Its specific gravity was found to be 1P55 Analysis led to the formiula Pb C8 HO or Pb C4 1152 It should however be noticed that a trifling excess in the per centage of carbon obtained showed an increase rather than a decrease in the numnber of equivalents of ethyl This radical for which the provisional name of plumbic bisethyl is suggested is a colourless fluid possessing little or no odour It is insoluble in water but perfectly miscible with ether It burnis readily with a beautiftil orangecoloured flame edged with blue anid gives off fumes of oxide of lead The radical apypears to he incapable of formirng salts without a314 lartial decompositioln With weak acids there is no perceptible actioln but wheni they are concentrated and gently heated a gas is given off and crystalline salts are produced The chloride is insoluble in water but soluble in alcohol and in ether from which last liquid it crystallizes in satiny needles which are very volatile and provoke sneezing and lachrymation It burns with the characteristic lead flame and by long digestion with concentrated hydrochloric acid is converted into chloride of lead anid volatile products The sulphate also appears as a crystalline mass wheni plumbicbis ethyl is gently warmed with a few drops of concentrated sulphuric acid It is conveniently prepared by agitating the materials in a stoppered bottle an exit being made from time to time for the gas which is liberated Both these salts require analyses to fix their composition the details of which the author hopes shortly to be able to commrunicate The Action of Zincethyl on Chloride of Silver These substances react with somrie violence anid a black substance sinks in the liquid which proved to be a mixture of chloride and metallic silver The zincethyl seems partly to escape decompositionl even when the chloride is in excess and considerable heat is applied On the addition of water effervescence sets in and chloride of zinc is alone found in solution In another experiment dry ether was emnployed instead of water under a supposition that a solid compound might be formed soluble in that menstruum The only reaction however appeared to be that expressed by the equation C4 115 ZnAg C1Zn ClAgC4 11 A similar negative result was obtained when zinicethyl was made to react on protochloride of platinum PtCl The action is violent and the platinum is thrown down in the form of platinumblack The same remark also applies to protochloride of copper Cu2 Cl when simnilarly treated no combinationi of copper and ethyl could be thereby eliminated315 Action of Zincethyl on Iodide of Stanethyl This iodide C1 115 Snl I was readily obtained by heating sealed tubes containing excess of tinfoil and iodide of ethyl from 1500 to 1600 C The pure transparent crystals which were obtained by a little management were introduced in a meltedl state irnto a retort containing zincethyl It is necessary to cool the apparatus with water After breaking up the resulting mass the retort was heated until the therynometer marked 2100 C and the distillate which conI tained a slight excess of zincethyl was agitated with water anid treated with dilute acid as before described The resulting heavy liquid was again distilled and fractionized with the thermometer By far the larger portion came over between 1700 and 1800 as a clear and colourless body insoluble in water but soluble lilKe the other radicals in ether That section which pos sessed a boilingpoint between 176 and 80 C was taken for examiination and was found when burned with oxide of copper to owie the formula ive tlxe leormula Sn C8 II or Sn C4 1142 This compound for which the name stainic bisethyl is proposed has a specific gravity of 1192 In its external and more promineint characters it resembles plumbic bisethyl but an exception may be made that it is more stable It is very combustible burning witl a coloured flame and scintillation like that exhibited by the metal tin under the flame of the hydrooxygen blowpipe This radical appears to differ in several particulars from the organometal stanethyl C H1 SSn obtained by Dr Frankland by acting on sheetzinc with a salt of stanethyl This last body is described as a thick oily substance possessed of a powerful odour and having a specific gravity of 155 It differs also in its lower boilingpoint which is about 1500 C Pure stannic bisethyl is perfectly limpid inodorous and is acted ulpon by hydrochloric acid with difficulty A gas is slowly evolved on the application of heat and a chloride is formed which seems to be richer in tin than the radical itself The chloride appears to crystallize with difficulty and at usual temperatures has the conisistence of an oil It possesses a powerfully pungent odour and when heated a vapour which painfully attacks the skin of the face and produces fits of sneezing316 A corresponding bromide is formed when bromine is added to stannic bisethyl It is an oily body with an irritating odour When acted upon by ammonia an oxide is precipitated which witlh acids forms beautiful crystallizable salts readily soluble in water A complete history of these salts and their decompositions with zincethyl will possess much interest and may prove of valLue in referring to a few simple radicals the numerous complex bodies described by Lowig c The author is at present engaged on this branch of the inquiry a detailed account of which be hopes to embody in a comnmunication to the Royal Society the present paper being intended ouily as all outline to be hereafter filled in In conielusion the author would remark that a rich harvest canl scarcely fail to be reaped from submitting to the action of zincethyl the metallic compounds of other groups such as arseniic bismuth and antimony

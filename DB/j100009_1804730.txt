calls for an explanation The copy fur nished the reviewer was bound as an experiment in the proper method of folding hence Professor Ripley is not responsible for the following statement Without a finding list or explanatory text    it is doubtful if the vol ume can be made to serve the interests of academic instruction It is designed rather for the chief of a railroad or state commission traffic bu reau and for this purpose it is perhaps unfortunate that the maps should not have been more substantially mounted and bound The preface of the regular edition states that the atlas is to be used in connection with other volumes on freight classification and rates and on the front or verso of each map brief explanatory text is printed The finding list consists of an index of the freight territories indicating the number of the map on which each is found The work is substantially mounted and bound The binding is good buckram over standard binders board and the mounting is on linen tape of the style used for best library atlases W A SHELTON BALLEN D Bibliography of roadmaking and roads in the United Kingdom With an introduction by SIR GEORGE GIBB London King 1914 Pp xviii 281 15s This valuable and comprehensive bibliography was undertaken at the suggestion of Professor Sidney Webb and includes the ma terials in the British Museum Patent Office Library and the British Library of Political Science with data from other sources To reduce the bulk of detailed references certain classes of documents have been omitted such as the Ordinance Survey maps guide books since 1850 local acts of Parliament and annual reports of surveyors and highway committees The contents have been classified as far as possible under the gen eral headings 1 history and description 2 administration 3 construction and repair and 4 traffic Under the first two head ings general works are listed separately from those on the several geographical divisions of the United Kingdom Under each group the arrangement appears to be chronological An author index and a subject index add further to the serviceableness of the work J A FAIRLIE BAUMBERGER R Die Haftung fur Reisegepiick nach

1913 Pp xxi 260 125 Speeches made between 1905 and 1913 have been collected in this volume and only one of the eight has to do with the special problems which the author has been called upon to solve in his present position as chief executive of the N Y N H  H R R He fails to recognize the fact that the irritated state of the public mind which has resulted in more strict legislation in recent years is to be accounted for by high finance rather than by high freight rates by disregard of law or public opinion and colossal extrava gance of managers and directors rather than by incivility of over worked and underpaid ticket sellers and by large speculative profits in promotions and underwriting schemes rather than by reasonable returns paid to widows and orphans who have purchased rail road securities The book contains not a word which would indicate that there had ever been an error or fault committed by those in control of the policy of the railroads There is a considerable amount of statistical material most of which is familiar to students of railroad affairs The way in which these statistics are used is not always such as to command respect or inspire confidence in the rest of the authors work For example on page 15 he compares railroad earnings and expenses for 1906 1907 and 1908 without mentioning the panic of 1907 which ac counted for the low railroad earnings of 1908 but on the contrary he says These were three years of fairly good business in the country when farmers and manufacturers did well Again on page 57 he compares the average rate of return on railroad securi ties in 1909 407 with the net income of manufacturing institu tions in 1905 1306 per cent evidently computed from the census returns of that year and does not note the fact so carefully pointed out by the Bureau of the Census that it is impossible to figure net income with even an approximation of truth on the basis of the cen sus figures On page 182 he gives the capital embarked in agricul ture in the United States in 1910 as 40991449000 and the returns as 138 per cent in 1890 168 in 1900 and 168 in 1905 Where he obtains these percentage figures he does not say neither does he say that they are net income figures though that is the impli cation for they are compared with returns on bank capital and railroad securities In fact they are probably gross product figures1914 Transportation and Communication 381 with no deductions for wages fertilizer or other expenses and cer tainly none for the wages of the farmer himself which on any fair basis of computation would in the majority of cases equal or exceed his net profit Although the author does iiot so state the implication is that railroad travel in the United States is safer than in Europe On page 177 he cites these figures In Europe on 206987 miles in 1910 there were killed 554 passengers 2607 employees and 4465 other persons or a total of 7626 In the United States on 248888 miles reported in 1912 there were killed 318 passengers 3235 employees and 6632 other persons or a total of 10185 His only comment is that 5434 of those killed in the United States were trespassers and that absolute obedience is not encouraged enough in American education or in the American home The absurdity of miles of line as a basis of comparison is too evident to call for discussion C W D FISCHER L E Economics of interurban railways New York McGrawHill 1914 Pp ix 116 150 A book of barely one hundred small pages is hardly sufficient to cover properly the subject of interurban railway economics Mr Fischer undoubtedly intended his work as a primer rather than as a treatise Yet in his preface he intimates that he has compiled his data so as to be useful to the great number of persons who are promoting or are encouraging the promotion of electric interurban railways This class of readers certainly require more elaborate analysis of facts The features of railway economics covered pertain to construc tion and to operation In the discussion of operations conclusions are based on averages derived from results of typical cases of normal interurban lines The latter are defined as having certain definite characteristics among which are 1 entrances into cities towns and villages 2 private right of way outside cities etc and 3 reasonable curves and gradients MIr Fischer holds that the best method of estimating probable revenues of a projected line is to apply the known unit results obtained by the operating roads whose type of construction and method of operation and the general characteristics of whose territory are in all respects similar to and comparable with homologous attributes of the projected road On the basis of his typical cases he estimates the range of construction cost of interurban lines from 26720 to 38650 per mile of track A cost of 35000 therefore is a fair approximate average for a normal line Realizing the danger of basing judg ments solely on statistical averages he cautions the layman from acting in any case without special investigation and expert assistance The concluding chapter gives an interesting summary of invest ment return construction cost and operating revenues and expenses Applications of principles are made with reference to typical cases A M SAKOLSKI382 Reviews of Books LJune HAUSMEISTER P Deutsche Eisenbahnkunde

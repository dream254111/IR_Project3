PRODUCING WITH GREATER DISTINCTNESS THE PHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGE,I206995, 325 J XVI ON THE INFLUENCE OF IODINE IN RENDERING SEVERAL ARGENTINE COMPOUNDS SPREAD ON PAPER SENSITIVE TO LIGHT AND ON A NEW METHOD OF PRODUCING WITH GREATER DISTINCTNESS THE PHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGE BY MR ROBERT HUNT COMMUNICATED BY SIR J F W HERSCHEL BART KH VPRS SSC C RECEIVED MAY 13READ JUNE 18 1840 1THE MAGICAL PERFECTION OF THE DESIGNS DELINEATED BY LIGHT ON THE PREPARED TABLETS OF M DAGUERRE AND THE EXTREME SENSITIVENESS OF HIS PHOTOGRAPHIC MATERIAL RENDER THE DISCOVERY OF INAPPRECIABLE VALUE TO ART AND SCIENCE IT APPEARED TO ME UNFORTUNATE THAT A PROCESS WHICH PROMISED TO IMPROVE OUR PERCEPTIONS OF THE BEAUTIFUL AND WHICH PLACED IN THE HANDS OF THE SCIENTIFIC OBSERVER AN INSTRUMENT OF WONDERFUL DELICACY SHOULD HAVE ITS UTILITY CIRCUMSCRIBED BY ITS EXPENSE AND INCONVENIENCE HAD THE ART OF ENGRAVING THE DAGUERREOTYPE TABLETS OR ANY OTHER MODE OF MULTIPLY ING COPIES OF THE ORIGINAL DESIGNS BEEN DISCOVERED NOTHING FURTHER WOULD HAVE BEEN DESIRED  BUT AS IT WAS IT APPEARED TO BE OF THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE THAT MEANS SHOULD BE SOUGHT FOR OF USING SOME LIGHTER AND LESS EXPENSIVE MATERIAL EVEN M ARAGO WHEN SPEAKING ON THE REPORT OF THE COMMISSION ON DAGUERRES PENSION REMARKS IT HAD UNQUESTIONABLY BEEN PREFERABLE FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF TRAVELLERS AND ALSO ON THE SCORE OF ECONOMY COULD PAPER HAVE BEEN HERE EMPLOYED IT WILL WITHOUT DOUBT OCCUR TO ALL THAT THE ORIGINAL PHOTOGRAPHIC PROCESSES DIS COVERED BY MR FOX TALBOT AND PUBLISHED BY THAT GENTLEMAN SOME TIME PRIOR TO THE DISCLOSURE OF DAGUERRES SECRET WERE ON PAPER AND THOUGH COMPELLED TO ADMIT THE SUPERIOR BEAUTY THE INFINITE MINUTENESS OF DETAIL AND THE CHARM OF THE AERIAL EFFECT IN THE PICTURES DRAWN ON THE POLISHED TABLETS YET IT MUST BE ALLOWED THE GREAT END OF THE ART BEING THE MULTIPLICATION OF AN INDEFINITE NUMBER OF FACSIMILES OF ORIGINAL DRAWINGS WE CAN ONLY EXPECT TO ARRIVE AT IT BY FOLLOWING IN THE STEPS OF OUR TALENTED COUNTRYMAN WHOSE RECENT PRODUCTIONS WITH THE SIGHT OF SOME OF WHICH I HAVE BEEN FAVOURED BY THE EXTREME KINDNESS OF SIR JOHN HERSCHEL ARE OF THE RICHEST PROMISE TO MR TALBOT THEREFORE WE MUST CONCEDE THE HIGH MERIT OF BEING THE DISCOVERER OF THE PHOTOGRAPHIC PROCESSES WHICH WILL PROBABLY ULTIMATELY TURN OUT THE MOST CONVENIENT AND MOST EXTENSIVELY USEFUL BY A CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE MEANS EMPLOYED TO GIVE THE REQUIRED SENSITIVENESS TO THE SILVER SURFACE PARTICULARLY THE APPLICATION OF HEAT AND THE SUBSEQUENT RUBBING WITH NITRIC ACID WHICH PERFORMS A MORE IMPORTANT PART TTLAN MERELY POLISHING I WAS CONVINCED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF COVERING PAPER WITH A PREPALRATION ON WHICH THE IODINE AND MERCURY MIGHT OPERATE AS THEY ARE FOUND TO DO UPON THE PLATE OF METAL326 MR ROBERT HUNT ON THE INFLUENCE OF IODINE IN RENDERING THIS LED TO MNANY EXPERIMENTS AND AS I CONSIDER THAT THE RESULTS ARRIVED AT ARE OF CONSIDERABLE SCIENTIFIC IMPORTANCE I SHALL WITHOUT APOLOGY PROCEED TO DETAIL A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATIONS WHICH IT APPEARS TO ME PROMISE TO EXTEND THE PRINCIPLES OF PHOTOGRAPHY TO PURPOSES OF HIGH INTEREST AND OF MUCH UTILITY 1 M DAGUERRE HAS STATED THAT A SOLID SILVER PLATE IS LESS EFFECTIVE THAN ONE OF COPPER PLATED WITH SILVER ALL MY EXPERIMENTS GO TO PROVE THE CORRECTNESS OF THIS STATEMENT THIS HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTED AND I THINK CORRECTLY TO ELECTRIC INFLUENCE CALLED INTO OPERATION IN THE PREPARING PROCESSES BY HEAT AND WITH THE ACID IT WILL BE FOUND THAT AN UNPREPARED PLATE REQUIRES AS LONG AGAIN TO BECOME PROPERLY COATED WITH IODINE AS DOES A PREPARED ONE AND A PURE PLATE THOUGH CAREFULLY PREPARED A THIRD LONGER TIME THAN A COMPOUND ONE IT IS NECESSARY TO PRODUCE IODIDATION READILY AND TO ENSURE THE BEST EFFECT FROM RADIATION THAT A SEMIOXIDIZED SURFACE BE PRESENTED TO THE IODINE THIS FACT WILL RENDER OBVIOUS THE SUPERIORITY OF THE TWO METALS COMMON OBSERVATION WILL SHOW THAT PLATED GOODS LOSE THEIR LUSTRE MUCH SOONER THAN SILVER ARTICLES THE PROCESS OF OXIDATION BEING MUCH ACCELERATED BY THE COMPOUND ARRANGEMENT 2 IF AN UNPREPARED PLATE BE IODIDATED AND EXPOSED TO LIGHT IT DARKENS AND ITS SUPERFICIAL COAT MAY BE EASILY RUBBED OFF LEAVING A SURFACE OF EXQUISITE LUSTRE SOME WHAT DARKER THAN THAT WHICH RESULTS FROM THE NITRIC ACID PROCESS AND MORE SUSCEPTIBLE OF IODIDATION WHETHER A FILM OF OXIDE OR IODIDE OF SILVER IS HERE PRODUCED I AM UNCERTAIN I SUSPECT THE FORMER IT IS HOWEVER EVIDENT THAT THE SILVER HAS UNDERO GONE SOME CHANGE 3 IF A LEAF OF VERY PURE UNTARNISHED SILVER BE CAREFULLY SPREAD UPON CARD OR A PIECE OF GLASS AND AT ONCE EXPOSED TO THE VAPOUR OF IODINE IT WILL BE FOUND TO REMAIN UN ATTACKED FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME 4 IF A SILVER LEAF THUS SPREAD BE WELL BURNISHED IT WILL BE SEEN THAT IODINE ACTS UPON IT MORE READILY THAN BEFORE 5 IF WE BURNISH HALF OF A LEAF AND TARNISH A PORTION OF BOTH THE DULL AND BRIGHT PARTS THE IODINE WILL THEN ATTACK FIRST THE TARNISHED THEN THE BRIGHT AND LAST OF ALL THE UNPOLISHED PORTION 6 SPREADING A LEAF OF SILVER UPON A PIECE OF COPPER FOIL AND TO RENDER THE ADHESION PERFECT APPLYING A GENTLE HEAT A SURFACE WAS FORMED WHICH RECEIVED THE IODINE READILY A SHEET THUS PREPARED WAS PERFECTLY IODIDATED IN FIVE MINUTES WHEREAS A SURFACE OF THE SAME EXTENT ON GLASS REQUIRED TWELVE MINUTES THESE RESULTS ESTABLISHED IN MY MIND MOST SATISFACTORILY THE POSSIBILITY OF GIVING TO PAPER ALL THE PROPERTIES OF THE SILVER PLATES IT IS CLEARLY SHOWN THAT A DEGREE OF OXIDATION IS REQUIRED ON THE METALLIC SURFACE FROM THIS FACT THE NECESSITY IS SUG GESTED OF EXAMINING THE PECULIARITIES OF ACTION MANIFESTED BY IODINE ON THE OXIDES OF SILVER PRODUCED IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND THEIR RELATIVE STATES OF SENSIBILITY TO LUMINOUS INFLUENCE INDUCED BY IODIDATION  SEE PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE VOL XVI P 271ARGENTINE COMPOUNDS SPREAD ON PAPER SENSITIVE TO LIGHT ETC 327 TO PREVENT CIRCUMLOCUTION IN DESCRIBING THE RESULTS OF THE INQUIRIES INTO WHICH I WAS LED I WOULD EXPLAIN THAT WHEN I SPEAK OF A PAPER BEING RENDERED SENSITIVE I ALWAYS MEAN THAT IT BECOMES AFTER EXPOSURE TO LIGHT CAPABLE OF RECEIVING THE MNER CURIAL VAPOUR 7 MURIATED PHOTOGRAPHIC PAPERS VARIOUSLY PREPARED PASS MORE OR LESS RAPIDLY THROUGH THE STAGES OF OXIDATION TO A PERFECT REDUCTION OF THE METAL BY THE OPERATIONS OF LIGHT AN EXAMINATION OF THE EFFECTS OF IODINE ON ALL VARIETIES OF THESE PAPERS WAS INSTI TUTED ANY OF THE ORDINARY PHOTOGRAPHIC PAPERS ALLOWED TO DARKEN TO A FULL BROWN BE COME BY LONG EXPOSURE TO IODINE OF A STEELBLUE OR A VIOLET COLOUR IF EXPOSED IN THIS STATE TO SLUNSHINE FOR A LONG PERIOD THEIR COLOURS CHANGE FROM GRAY TO A CLEAR OLIVE NOW EXPOSURE TO SUNSHINE FOR A MINUTE OR TO DIFFUSED DAYLIGHT FOR FROM FIVE TO TEN MINUTES PRODUCES NO APPARENT CHANGE BUT MERCURIAL VAPOUR SPEEDILY ATTACKS THE UNCOVERED PARTS AND A FAITHFUL PICTURE IS GIVEN OF WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN SUPERPOSED BUT THERE IS A WANT OF SUFFICIENT CONTRAST BETWEEN THE LIGHTS AND SHADOWS 8 BY ALLOWING THE FIRST DARKENING ACTION TO PROCEED UNTIL AN OLIVE COATING IS FORMED ON THE PAPER I FIND ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT MORE SPEEDILY AFFECTED BY THE IODINE THAT IT IS MORE SENSITIVE AND A BETTER PICTURE IS FORMED THAN UPON THE BROWN PAPER THE KIND OF PREPARATION USED APPEARLS TO HAVE BUT LITTLE EFFECT UPON THE RESULTS A CHLORIDE IODIDE OR BROMIDE OF SILVER ALLOWED TO DARKEN ANSWERS EQUALLY WELL THERE ARE BESIDE THE FAINTNESS OF THE PICTURE THUS PRODUCED DEFECTS WHICH WILL I FEAR PREVENT OUR AVAILING OURSELVES OF THIS EASY METHOD OF PRODUCING A MODERATELY SENSITIVE DAGUERREOTYPE PAPER IN THE FIRST PLACE THE COAT OF OXIDE FORMED AT THE INSTANT OF EXPOSURE PROTECTS THE UNDER LAYERS OF THE SALT AND THE DECOMPOSING PRO CESS PROCEEDS IRREGULARLY AND EVEN THE LONGEST EXPOSURE APPEARS INSUFFICIENT TO REMOVE THE WHOLE OF THE CHLORINE WHICH OBSTINATELY IN THE FORM OF THE SUBCHLORIDE OF SILVER REMAINS IN THE PAPER THIS OCCASIONS THE IODIDATION TO BE LESS COMPLETE IN SOME PARTS THAN IN OTHERS AND CONSEQUENTLY A VARIATION IN THE PHOTOGRAPHIC EFFECT AGAIN IT APPEARS THAT UPON THE SURFACE LONG EXPOSURE EFFECTS A REVIVAL OF THE SILVER IN MINUTE POINTS AROUND WHICH THE NMERCURIAL VAPOUR IS DEPOSITED IN GREATER QUANTITY THAN OVER THE OTHER PARTS OF THE PAPER 9 MY NEXT OBJECT WAS THE PRODUCTION OF A PERFECT OXIDE OF SILVER EQUALLY DIFFUSED OVER EVERY PORTION OF THE PAPER IN THIS I HAVE ENCOUNTERED MANYVERY GREAT DIFFICULTIES IRREGULARITIES ALMOST BEYOND DETECTION BY OTHER MEANS BECAME OF SERIOUS CONSEQUENCE IN THE DELICATE PROCESS I WAS STUDYING THE MOST EFFECTUAL METHOD I HAVE DISCOVERED IS FIRST TO SOAK THE SHEET IN A WEAK SOLUTION OF PURE POTASSA AND AFTER PARTIALLY DRYING IT WHICH MUST BE DONE QUICKLY PASS IT THROTUGH A SOLUTION OF THE NITRATE OF SILVER AND ALLOW IT TO DRY SLOWLY IN THE DARK THE PAPER IS NOW A LIGHT BROWN BUT BY HEATING IT OVER A METALLIC PLATE OR328 MR ROBERT HUNT ON THE INFLUENCE OF IODINE IN RENDERING IN FRONT OF A CLEAR FIRE TO A POINT JUST BELOW THAT AT WHICH IT WOULD BE SCORCHED A PERFECT FORMATION OF THE OLIVE OXIDE OF SILVER RESULTS THE IODINE VAPOUR REQUIRES AN EQUALLY LONG TIME TO PRODUCE ANY VISIBLE EFFECT UPON THIS PAPER AS UPON THOSE BEFORE MENTIONED 8 9 BUT HALF AN HOUR IS SUFFICIENT TO RENDER THIS PREPARATION SO FAR IODIDATED AS IS NECESSARY OR INDEED AS IS POSSIBLE WITH OUT IMPAIRING ITS SENSIBILITY THIS IODIDATED OXIDE REQUIRES A STRONG LIGHT TO YIELD ANY DECIDED EFFECT AND A GREATER HEAT THAN IS DIRECTED BY DAGUERRE MUST BE APPLIED TO THE MERCURY TO BRING OUT THE IMPRESSION WHICH IS BUT FAINT AT LAST 10 THE PROTOXIDE OF SILVER AND SOME OF ITS SALTS NOW ENGAGED MY ATTENTION TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE FACTS POINTED OUT BY WOHLER I EXPOSED PAPERS SATURATED WITH A SOLUTION OF THE NITRATE OF SILVER AND DRIED IN A CYLINDER WHICH WAS KEPT HOT BY BOILING WATER TO A CURRENT OF VERY PURE HEATED HYDROGEN GAS BY THIS MEANS I OB TAINED A PAPER OF A BRICKRED COLOUR THIS APPEARS TO BE A NITRATE OF THE PROTOXIDE OF SILVER BY SOAKING THIS PAPER IN RAIN WATER FOR SOME TIME THE FREE ACID WAS REMOVED FROM IT AND ON DRYING IT BECAME DARKER THAN BEFORE THIS PAPER IS NOT VERY READILY ATTACKED BY THE IODINE BUT IT IS BY THE EXPOSURE OF AN HOUR TO A FULL VOLUME OF ITS VAPOUR RENDERED SLIGHTLY SENSITIVE 11 BY ILMMNERSING A PAPER PREPARED AS ABOVE 10 IN A SOLUTION OF PURE POTASSA THE SALT IS DECOMNPOSED AND THE PAPER ON DRYING BECOMES A FULL BLACK WHICH ON BEING PASSED THROUGH STEEL ROLLERS ASSUMES A FINE LUSTRE RESEMBLING THAT GIVEN BY PLUMBAGO THIS PAPER IS INORE READILY ATTACKED BY THE IODINE THAN THE FORMER 10 BUT IT IS NOT MORE SENSITIVE IN BRIGHT SUNSHINE I HAVE PRODUCED A TOLERABLE COPY OF A LEAF WITH ITS DELICATE VERNATIONS BUT IN THE CAMERA I HAVE NEVER SUCCEEDED AS I DESIRED OR INDEED AS I EXPECTED 12 THE DEUTOXIDE OF SILVER IS REDUCED TO THE METALLIC STATE BY HYDROGEN AT HIGH TEMPERATURES BY THE SAME ARRANGEMENT AS ABOVE 10 I WAS ENABLED TO GET A VERY PERFECT SILVER PAPER WHICH IN ALL RESPECTS WAS SIMILAR TO THE PAPER WHICH IS MECHA NICALLY SILVERED 3 13 HAVING PROVED THAT IODINE HAS THE POWER OF RENDERING SENSITIVE NOT ONLY THE OXIDES OF SILVER BUT A SALT OF THE PROTOXIDE IT BECAME AN INTERESTING INQUIRY TO AS CERTAIN WHETHER IT WOULD PRODUCE ANY LIKE EFFECT UPON OTHER SALTS OF SILVER THE ONLY ONE HOWEVER I HAVE YET DISCOVERED WHICH ADMRITS OF THE DESIRED INFLUENCE IS THE YELLOWBROWN PHOSPHATE OF SILVER THE IODINE IN TWO HOURS DOES NOT PRODUCE THE SLIGHTEST CHANGE OF COLOUR BUT EXPOSURE TO LIGHT AND THE VAPOUR OF MERCURY SHOWS THAT THE IODINE IMPARTS SOME SENSITIVENESS TO THIS SALT 14 A CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF TIHE SILVER SURFACES PRODUCED BY THE ACTION OF THE PER PHOSPHURETTED HYDROGEN GAS ON VARIOUS SALTS OF THAT METAL NOW OCCUPIED MY ATTEN TION AND UNDIVIDEDLY ENGAGED IT FOR A VERY CONSIDERABLE TIME  JOURNAL DE PHARM JUILLET 1839ARGENTINE COMPOUNDS SPREAD ON PAPER SENSITIVE TO LIGHT ETC 329 MY FIRST ATTETNPTS AT PRODUCING BY THIS MEANS EXTETLSIVE SURFACES WERE FAILURES THE PAPER GENERALLY PRESENTED A GRAY SILVER SPOT SURROUNDED BY A SERIES OF HIGHLY CO LOURED RINGS AND AN EXTERNAL ONE OF A VELVET BLACK THESE WERE OF COURSE PHOSPHO RUS AND SILVER IN VARIOUS PROPORTIONS EVEN IN THIS STATE SUNSHINE APPEARS TO HAVE SOME EFFECT UPON THIE PAPERS THLE INNER MOST CIRCLES THE REDAND YELLOW PASS WITH TOLE RABLE QUICKNESS INTO DIFFERENT SHADES OF OLIVE BY EXPOSURE TO IODINE THE COLOURED RINGS ARE ATTACKED AND CHANGED IN THEIR CHA RACTERS LONG BEFORE ANY INFLUENCE IS APPARENT ON THE PURE SILVER SPOT GENERALLY BUT NOT ALWAYS ASSUMING THEIR COMPLEMENTARY COLOURS THE SENSITIVENESS OF THESE BANDS IS AS THEIR POSITION THE BLACK EXHIBITING A DECIDED ACTION WHICH LESSENS IN EVERY RING AND IS LOST ON THE VERGE OF TILE GRAY SILVER IF THE SILVER IS ALLOWED TO ASSUME THE REQUIRED GOLDEN HUE FROM THE IODINE THE ORDER OF SENSITIVENESS IS REVERSED 15 TO PREVENT EXPLOSIONS OF THIS SPONTANEOUSLY INFLAMMABLE GAS I HAVE AMONGST OTHER METHODS USED THE VAPOUR OF ETHER WHEN THIS HAS BEEN THE CASE AT THE MO MENT OF REDUCTION A PORTION OF CARBON APPEARS TO BE SEPARATED FROM THE ETHER AND COMBINING WITH THE PHOSPHORUS IS DEPOSITED ON THE PAPER FORMING A BAND OF A YELLOW BROWN TINT WHICH IS SOMETIMES FOUND WITHIN AND AT OTHERS WITHOUT THE COLOURED CIRCLE THE PLACE APPEARING TO DEPEND ON TEMPERATURE I WAS AT FIRST INCLINED TO CON SIDER THIS AS A SIMPLE COMBINATION OF PHOSPHORUS AND CARBON BUT THE SENSITIVENESS OF THE BAND INCLINES ME TO THE OPINION OF ITS BEING A CARBOPHOSPHURET OF SILVER I SHOULD STATE THAT IT STANDS NEXT TO BLACK IN THE ORDER OF SENSIBILITY I FIND TE SAME EFFECT IS PRODUCED BY DISSOLVING THE NITRATE OF SILVER WITH WHICH THE PAPER IS WASHED IN SPIRITS OF WINE 16 BY VERY CAREFULLY SPREADING A STRONG SOLUTION OF THE NITRATE OF SILVER OVER A HIGHLYCALENDERED PAPER AND THEN EXPOSING IT TO THE PERPHOSPHURETTED HYDROGEN SLOWLY EVOLVED FROM THE PHOSPHURET OF LIME A VERY EVEN METALLIC SURFACE WAS FORMNED FROM THE LEADEN COLOUR OF WHICH IT MAY BE CONCLUDED SOME PHOSPHORUS HAD ENTERED INTO COMBINATION WITH THE SILVER THIS PAPER WAS SOON ATTACKED BY THE IODINE WAS LITTLE LESS SENSITIVE THAN THE SILVERED COPPER BUT IT WAS SCARCELY POSSIBLE TO REMOVE THE IODINE SO AS TO PRESERVE THE PICTURE WHEN COMPLETE WITHOUT PORTIONS OF THE SURFACE BREAKING AWAY SO SLIGHT WAS THE ADHESION BETWEEN THE PAPER AND THE METAL 17 BY ALLOWING THE PAPER TO ABSORB THE SILVER SOLUTION AND TO BECOME NEARLY BUT NOT QUITE DRY BEFORE EXPOSED TO THE GAS AND THE GAS WHICH I USUALLY FORM FROM PHOS PHORUS AND SOLUTION OF POTASSA BEING LIBERATED IN LARGE QUANTITIES A BLACK PAPER POSSESSING IN A VERY EMINENT DEGREE ALL THAT IS DESIRED IS THE RESULT UNFORTUNATELY HOWEVER ALTHOUGH I HAVE USED EVERY PRECAUTION I FIND IT IM POSSIBLE TO PREPARE MORE THAN A DOZEN QUARTERSHEETS WITHOUT AN EXPLOSION OF THE GAS IN PLACING AND REMOVING THE PAPER ATMOSPHERIC AIR NECESSARILY ENTERS THE VESSEL BE SIDES WHICH A QUANTITY OF OXYGEN SUFFICIENT TO OCCASION SPONTANEOUS INFLAMMATION IS SET FREE FROM THE NITRATE OF SILVER AND THE WATER ABSORBED BY THE PAPERS ON ONE OC CASION I SO PLACED AND ARRANGED SOME PAPERS IN A VESSEL AS TO DO AWAY WITH THE POS MDCCCXL 2 U330 MR ROBERT HUNT ON THE INFLUENCE OF IODINE IN RENDERING SIBILITY OF ANY ADMISSION OF ATMOSPHERIC AIR THE FORMATION OF THE BLACK PHOSPHURET OF SILVER WAS GOING ON BEAUTIFULLY WHEN THE LARGE GLASS VESSEL BURST WITH SUCH VIO LENCE THAT THE LARGEST PIECE I COULD FIND WAS BUT THE SIXTEENTH OF AN INCH OVER I DO NOT AT PRESENT SEE ANY WAY OF PREPARING THOSE PAPERS WITH SAFETY AND MUCH AGAINST MY INCLINATION I HAVE ABANDONED TILE USE OF THIS GAS 18 THE EXPOSURE OF MURIATED AND SIMPLY NITRATED PHOTOGRAPHIC PAPER DARKENED BY LIGHT TO THE VAPOUR OF PHOSPHORUS SUGGESTED ITSELF IT HAS BEEN NOTICED THAT MOST VAPOURS HAVE A DISPOSITION TO ATTACK BY THE EDGES THUS IT IS WITH THAT OF PHOSPHORUS IF THE PAPER BE SUSPENDED THE EDGES WILL PRESENT A BAND OF SILVER SLIGHTLY COLOURED LONG BEFORE THE OTHER PARTS EXHIBIT ANY SIGNS OF HAVING BEEN AT ALL ACTED ON THE PRECAUTION THEREFORE OF FIXING THE PAPER IN A FRAME AND EXPOSING ITS FLAT SURFACE OVER A LARGE QUANTITY OF PHOSPHORUS BROKEN INTO SMALL PIECES IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE IN THE PREPARATION WHEN CAREFULLY PREPARED THIS PAPER STANDS ABOVE THE OXIDES OF SILVER FOR SENSIBILITY BUT INFINITELY BELOW THE PHOSPHURET 19 THE VAPOUR OF SULPHUR WAS NEXT TRIED AND TO A GREAT EXTENT WITH SUCCESS IF THE PAPER WAS PLACED IN THE VAPOUR WHILE YET WET THE REDUCTION WAS TOO RAPID AND THE CONTINUITY OF THE SURFACE WAS BROKEN IF ALLOWED TO DRY A MORE PERFECT SURFACE WAS FORMED BUT IT WAS EXCEEDINGLY APT TO BECOME IRIDESCENT AND EVERY SHADE AFTER THE IODINE WAS APPLIED WAS DIFFERENTLY SENSITIVE IT HOWEVER SOMETIMES FURNISHED A VERY PERFECT PAPER CAPABLE OF PRODUCING A FINE PHOTOGRAPHIC PICTURE 20 THE ACTION OF SULPHUROUS ACID GAS WAS STUDIED WITH ATTENTION BUT ONLY WHEN THE PAPER WAS ABSOLUTELY DRY AND MAINTAINED AT A HIGH TEMPERATURE COULD I SUCCEED IN GETTING ANY REVIVAL OF THE SILVER WHICH WAS RAPIDLY ATTACKED BY THE GAS AND CON VERTED INTO A SULPHATE 21 PAPERS PREPARED WITH THE NITRATE OF SILVER ARE WHEN PLUNGED INTO A VESSEL CON TAINING SULPHURETTED HYDROGEN SPEEDILY COVERED WITH SULPHURET OF SILVER THE FIRST ACTION OF TLIE GAS IS THE REVIVAL OF VERY WHITE SILVER OVER WHICH A BROWN SHADE IS QUICKLY DIFFUSED WHICH PASSES INTO A LEAD COLOUR IF THE PAPER IS MOIST OR BECOMES VA RIEGATED IF IT IS WET THESE PAPERS ARE EQUAL IN MOST RESPECTS TO THOSE PREPARED WITH THE PHOSPHURETTED COMBINATION 22 IF A CURRENT OF SULPHURETTED HYDROGEN BE THROWN UPON A PAPER STILL WET WITH SOLUTION OF NITRATE OF SILVER BEAUTIFUL COLOURED RINGS ARE PRODUCED WHEN THE GAS IS FULLY SATURATED WITH SULPHUR THESE RINGS ARE VERY DARK AND OF THE RICHEST LUSTRE IF IN THIS STATE THEY ARE PLACED BETWEEN THE LEAVES OF A PRINTED VOLUME A PERFECT COPY OF THE PRINTING IS MADE IN TWENTYFOUR HOURS THE LETTERS BEING WHITE BY PASSING THE PAPER THROUGH AN ALCOHOLIC SOLUTION OF IODINE THE LETTERS BECOME A FULL BLACK THE SINGULAR NATURE OF THIS FACT WILL ACCOUNT FOR ITS INTRODUCTION IN THIS PLACE  ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS WHEN PAPERS VARIOUSLY PREPARED BUT NOT DARKENED AND MARKED AND NUMBERED WITH PENCIL AT THE BACK HAVE BEEN LAID TOGETHER FACE TO BACK IN THE DARK FOR SOME TIME THE PENCIL MARKS ON SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN FOUND EXACTLY COPIED IN REVERSE IN A DARK BROWN IMPRESSION ON THEIR NEIGHBOURS THISARGENTINE COMPOUNDS SPREAD ON PAPER SENSITIVE TO LIGHT ETC 331 23 BY PLUNGING A PAPER WASHED WITH THE SOLUTION OF THE NITRATE OF SILVER INTO A VERY DILUTED VOLUME OF SULPHURETTED HYDROGEN AND TRANSFERRING IT FROM THENCE INTO PURE GAS A TOLERABLY PERFECT SURFACE IS GENERALLY OBTAINED THE CONTINUAL PLAGUE OF THIS PROCESS IS THE WANT OF PERFECT UNIFORMITY IN THE TEXTURE OF THE PAPER WHICH WILL OFTEN IN SPITE OF EVERY CARE OCCASION AN UNEQUAL ABSORPTION AND THUS MAR THE EFFECT 24 HAVING TRIED EVERY VARIETY OF PAPER I COULD PROCURE AND FINDING ALL MORE OR LESS OBJECTIONABLE I HAD RECOURSE TO SIZES OF ALMOST EVERY VARIETY THE DIFFICULTY WAS NOT HOWEVER OVERCOME BY ANY OF THEM THE ONE WHICH ANSWERED BEST WAS STARCH WHICH HAS THE VERY SINGULAR PROPERTY OF ALTERING THE GENERAL APPEARANCE OF THAT POR TION OF THE PICTURE WHICH IS FORMED BY THE MERCURIAL VAPOUR WHEN IT IS IMMERSED IN SOLUTIONS OF THE MURIATE OR HYPOSULPHITE OF SODA DESTROYING THE DOWNY APPEARANCE AND GIVING IT A SHEETED SILVERY ONE 25 THE EXPERIENCE GAINED BY PREPARING THESE SULPHURETTED PAPERS ON AN EXTENSIVE SCALE ENABLES ME TO POINT OUT A METHOD BY WHICH MOST OF THE DEFECTS ARISING FROM THE INEQUALITIES OF THE PAPER AND ITS DIFFERENT RATES OF IMBIBITION MAY BE OVERCOME THE PAPER IS TO BE FIRST SOAKED IN A WEAK SOLUTION OF THE MURIATE OF AMMONIA CARE FULLY WIPED WITH COTTON CLOTHS AND DRIED SLOWLY IT IS THEN TO BE DIPPED IN A VERY DILUTE SOLUTION OF THE NITRATE OF SILVER AND THE SMALL BTUBBLES WHICH FORM ON ITS SUR FACE TO BE CAREFULLY REMOVED WITH A CAMELSHAIR PENCIL WHEN THE PAPER IS DRIED WHICH MUST BE DONE IN THE DARK IT IS TO BE EXPOSED IN A CLOSED VESSEL TO SULPHURETTED HYDROGEN SLOWLY FORMED FROM THE SULPHURET OF ANTIMONY AND HYDROCHLORIC ACID IN A FEW MINUTES IT WILL DARKEN TO AN IRON BROWN THE PAPER MUST NOW BE PASSED THROUGH WATER SLIGHTLY IMPREGNATED WITH CHLORINE OR HYDROCHLORIC ACID AND AGAIN DRIED IT MUST THEN BE IMMERSED IN A SOLUTION OF SILVER RATHER STRONGER THAN THE FIRST AND DRIED WHETHER IN THE LIGHT OR OTHERWISE APPEARS OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE CARE BEING TAKEN THAT NO SHADOW FALLS ON THE PAPER AS SOME DIFFERENCE EXISTS BETWEEN THE SHADED AND EXPOSED PORTIONS BUT THE SENSITIVENESS CHANGES IN A SINGULARLY UNCERTAIN WAY FROM THE ONE TO THE OTHER IT IS TO BE AGAIN SUBJECTED TO SULPHURATION AND BY CAREFUL MANAGEMENT THE PROCESS IS NOW GENERALLY COMPLETED IF HOWEVER THE PAPER IS NOT CONSIDERED AS SUFFICIENTLY DARK IT MUST BE ONCE MORE WASHED IN THE SOLUTION OF SILVER AND AGAIN SUBJECTED TO THE ACTION OF SULPHURETTED HYDROGEN 26 IF THE ABOVE MURIATED PAPER 25 BE ALLOWED TO REMAIN IN THE SULPHURETTED HYDROGEN GAS AFTER THE MAXIMUM BLACKNESS IS PRODUCED IT IS AGAIN WHITENED WITH SOME QUICKNESS THIS MAY BE ACCOUNTED FOR IN TWO WAYS THE GAS MAY BE MIXED EFFECT IS NOT PRODUCED BY ALL PENCILS ON THE SAME PAPER AS A PREPARATION OF THE PAPER NITRATE OF SILVER OVER BORAX SEEMED TO SUCCEED BEST GOLDLEAF PRINTING THE COMMON ORNAMENTAL PRINTING ON CARDS C MAY BE COPIED ON NITRATED PAPER BY SIMPLE JUXTAPOSITION AND GENTLE PRESSURE FOR SOME TIME IN THE DARK WHICH IS PROBABLY OWING TO THE COPPER USED AS ALLOY AS THE OTHER MAY BE BY SULPHUR IN THE PENCILJ F W H 2 U2332 MR ROBERT HUNT ON THE INFLUENCE OF IODINE IN RENDERING WITH A PORTION OF MURIATIC VAPOUR OR A QUANTITY OF CHLORINE SUFFICIENT TO PRODUCE THIS EFFECT MAY BE LIBERATED FROM THE PREPARATION ON THE PAPER TO REACT ON THE SULPHURET OF SILVER THE MOST ELABORATE DIRECTIONS WOULD BE QUITE INSUFFICIENT TO ENSURE THE PRODLUCTION OF PERFECTLY EQUAL PAPERS IREPEATED EXPERIMENTS ALONE WILL ENSURE A CERTAINTY IN THE RESULT TO PRODUCE A GLITTERING METALLIC SURFACE IS LESS DIFFICULT BUT THE PERFECTION OF THE PAPERS CONSISTS IN HAVING A DEEP BLACK GROUND TO CONTRAST WITH THE MERCURIAL DEPOSIT NO SILVERING ON PAPER CAN BE BROUGHT TO THE LUSTRE OF THE METALLIC PLATES AND CONSEQUENTLY ALTHOUGH THE REVIVED SILVER MAY BE RENDERED TOLERABLY DARK BY USING VERY PURE SULPHURETTED HYDROGEN AND A STRONG SOLUTION OF SILVER YET THE CON TRASTS ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY DECIDED WITH THE BLACK PAPERS THE PICTURE IS SEEN EQUALLY WELL IN ALL DIRECTIONS AND THE ADHESION OF THE MERCURIAL PARTICLES IS CLOSER THAN WHERE A GLITTERING SURFACE HAS BEEN PRESENTED TO THE ACTION OF ITS VAPOUR 27 IF THE PAPER IS REMOVED FRORN THE SULPHURETTED HYDROGEN AT THLE MORMLENT THLE FIRST WHITE SILVER IS REVIVED OR STILL BETTER IF THE SILVER IS REVIVED BY HYDLOGEN GAS IT MAY BE USED TO PRODUCE EFFECTS LIKE WHAT SIR JOHN HERSCHEL DESIGNATES THE NEGATIVE VARIETY OF PHOTOGRAPHIC DRAWING AFTER THE DRAWING IS PRODUCED IN THE USUAL METHOD OF THE DAGUERREOTYPE IT IS ONLY NECESSARY TO IMMERSE IT IN A WARM SATURATED SOLUTION OF COMMON SALT THE SILVERED PORITION GRADUALLY ACQUIRES A BEAUTIFUL WHITENESS WHILE THE PARTS COVERED BY THE MER CURY PASS INTO A DEEP GRAY ALL THE FINE EFFECTS PRODUCIBLE BY THE ORIGINAL MURIATED PHOTOGRAPHIC PAPERS ARE GIVEN BY THIS PROCESS AND THE PICTURE HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING ABSOLUTELY PERMANENT METHOD OF USING THOSE PAPERS 28 ALL THE KINDS OF PAPER ABOVEMENTIONED MAY BE RENDERED SENSITIVE BY BEING EX POSED TO THE VAPOUR OF IODINE THE BEST MODE OF APPLYING WHICH IS TO SPREAD OVER A THIN BOARD THE SIZE OF THE SHEET A PASTE OF IODINE WITH SPIRITS OF WINE THIS BOARD IS PLACED IN A BOX AND THE PAPERS BEING FIXED IN A FRAME ABOUT THREE INCHES ABOVE IT ARE IODIDATED IN A FEW MINUTES THIS PLAN IS EQUALLY APPLICABLE TO THE PLATES FOR THE SULPHURETTED PAPER I RECOMMEND ANOTHER PLAN WHICH HAS MANY VELRY GREAT ADVANTAGES IT CONSISTS SIMPLY IN DRAWING THE SURFACE OF THE PAPER LIGHTLY OVER A SO LUTION THUS FORMED A SATURATED SOLUTION OF ANY HYDRIODIC SALT IS MADE TO DISSOLVE AS MUCH IODINE AS POSSIBLE AND OF THIS LIQUID TWO DRACHMS ARE MINGLED WITH FOUR OUNCES OF WATER CARE IS REQUIRED THAT ONE SIDE ONLY OF THE PAPER BE WETTED WHICH IS BY NO MEANS DIFFICULT TO EFFECT THE FLUID IS SO GREEDILY ABSORBED BY IT ALL THAT IS NECESSARY BEING A BROAD SHALLOW VESSEL TO ALLOW OF THE PAPER TOUCHING THE FLUID TO ITS FULL WIDTH AND THAT IT BE DRAWN OVER IT WITH A SLOW STEADY MOVEMENT WHEN THUS WETTED IT IS TO BE QUICKLY DRIED BY A WARM BUT NOT TOO BRIGHT FIRE OF COURSE DAYLIGHT MUST BE CAREFULLY EXCLUDED PAPERS THUS IODIDATED DO NOT LOSE THEIR SENSITIVENESS FOR MANY DAYSARGENTINE COMPOUNDS SPREAD ON PAPER SENSITIVE TO LIGHT ETC 333 29 THERE ARE MANY INCONVENIENCES ATTENDING THE USE OF FLUID MERCURY PARTICULARLY TO TRAVELLERS I THEREFORE PROPOSE A PLAN BY WHICH THIS MAY BE AVOIDED AND THE MER CURIALIZATION VERY MUCH FACILITATED IT IS THIS THE BOX USED FOR VAPORIZATION IS SO MLADE AS TO ADMIT OF A PIECE OF COPPER RATHER MORE THAN HALF THE SIZE OF THE PAPER OR PLATE BEING PLACED UPON THE IRON BOTTOM WHEN REQUIRED FOR USE THE COPPER IS RXUBBED OVER WITH THE NITRATE OF MERCURY WASHED DRIED AND FIXED IN ITS PLACE AS SOON AS THE COPPER GETS HOT WHICH IS VERY QUICKLY THE MERCURY ON ITS SURFACE IS VO LATILIZED AND THE ACTION ON THE PHOTOGRAPH EFFECTED I FIND THIS PLAN OCCUPIES ONLY HALF THE TIME OF THE ORIGINAL WITH A CAPSULE OF MERCURY 30 THE DRAWING IS NOW TO A CERTAIN EXTENT COMPLETE BUT I HAVE FOUND THE USE OF THE HYPOSULPHITE OF SODA TO REMOVE THE IODINE OBJECTIONABLE ON THE GROUND OF ITS TENDENCY TO DARKEN THE MERCURIAL DEPOSIT A WARM SOLUTION OF THE MURIATE OF SODA IS MORE EFFICACIOUS 31 I HAVE NOW TO CALL PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO A PHENOTENON OF A MOST REIRARIKABLE CHARACTER OPENING A WIDE FIELD FOR INQUIRY THE SINGULAR MANNER IN WHICH THE MER CURIAL VAPOUR ARRANGES ITSELF ON DAGUERRES TABLETS LIAS EXCITED MUCH ATTENTION AND GIVEN RISE TO NUMEROUS SPECULATIONS BUT EVEN THIS APPEARS TO ME FAR LESS CURIOUS THAN THE FOLLOWING DISCOVERY IF ONE OF THE ABOVE PAPERS WHEN REMOVED FROM THE MERCURIAL VAPOUR BE DIPPED INTO A SOLUTION OF THE BICHLORIDE OF MERCURY THE DRAWING DISAPPEARS BUT AFTER A FEW IMI NUTES IT IS SEEN AS IF BY MAGIC UNFOLDING ITSELF AND GRADUALLY BECOMING FAR MORE BEAUTIFUL AND WHITER THAN BEFOREDELICATE LINES BEFORE INVISIBLE OR BARELY SEEN ARE NOW DISTINCTLY MARKED AND A RARE AND SINGULAR PERFECTION OF DETAIL GIVEN TO THE DRAWING IT MAY APPEAR AT FIRST SIGHT THAT THE BICHLORIDE OF MERCURY DISSOLVES OFF THE METAL AND DEPOSITS IT AGAIN IN THE FORM OF CHLORIDE CALOMEL BUT THIS DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT IF THE PAPER HAS BEEN PREPARED WITH THE NITRATE OF SILVER THE MERCURY DISAPPEARS AND THE DRAWING VANISHES THE DEPOSIT TAKING PLACE ONLY ON THOSE PARTS UPON WHICH LIGHT HAS ACTED BUT FEEBLY AS FOR INSTANCE ON THE VERNATIONS OF LEAVES LEAVING THOSE PORTIONS OF SURFACE EXPOSED TO FULL LUMINOUS INFLUENCE WITHOUT A PARTICLE OF QUICKSILVER WHEN THE PAPER HAS BEEN EITHER A CHLORIDE OR IODIDE THE EFFECT IS AS ABOVE AND THE THICKNESS OF THE DEPOSIT IS AS THE INTENSITY OF THE LIGHT HAS BEEN CON SEQUENTLY THE SEMITINTS ARE BEAUTIFULLY PRESERVED IF THE DRAWING REMAINS TOO LONG IN THE SOLUTION THE PRECIPITATE ADHERES TO THE DARK PARTS AND DESTROYS THE EFFECT THE SINGULARITY OF THIS OPERATION WILL BE MORE STRIKING IF THE PICTURE HAS BEEN SOAKED FOR SOME TIME IN A SOLUTION OF THE HYPOSULPHITE OF SODA AND THEN DIPPED INTO THE BICHLO RIDE OF MERCURY AS THE DRAWING DISAPPEARS A SERIES OF CIRCLES FORMED OF A WHITE POWDER APPEAR TO ARISE FROM THE PAPER GENERALLY COMMENCING AT THE CENTRE AND SLOWLY EXTENDING OVER ITS WHOLE SURFACE THE POWDER IS AFTERWARDS DEPOSITED AND THE SHEET IS BURIED IN THE PRECIPITATE BUT ON TAKING THE PAPER FIROM THE LIQUID AND PASSING A STREAM OF WATER OVER IT THE PRECIPITATE IS ENTIRELY REMOVED FROM ALL THE PARTSMR ROBERT HUNT ON THE INFLUENCE OF IODINE EXCEPT THE LIGHTS OF THE PICTURE TO EXPLAIN THE RATIONALE OF THIS DEFINITE ARRANGEMENT OF A DENSE PRECIPITATE IS BEYOND MY POWER 32 SIR JOHN HERSCHEL HAS RECENTLY SHOWN THAT CORROSIVE SUBLIMATE OBLITERATES THE ORDINARY PHOTOGRAPHIC DRAWINGS AND THAT THEY MAY BE RESTORED BY THE HYPOSUL PHITE OF SODA AN EQUALLY SINGULAR EFFECT IS PRODUCED UPON SOME OF THE PAPERS ABOVE MENTIONED IF THE ORDINARY MURIATED PHOTOGRAPHIC PAPER DARKENED 7 8 BE USED TO PROCURE A DRAWING BY THE PROCESS WHICH OCCUPIES OUR ATTENTION ON BEING TREATED WITH A SOLUTION OF THE BICHLORIDE OF MERCURY THE DARK PARTS OF THE PICTURE ARE WHLLITENED AND IT OF COURSE BECOMES OF THE NEGATIVE VARIETY BUT IT IS SPEEDILY RENDERED POSITIVE OR THE LIGHTS AND SHADES CORRECTED BY THE HYPOSULPHITE OF SODA WE HAVE IT THUS IN OUR POWER TO PRODUCE UPON THE SAME SHEET TWO VERY MLARKED VARIETIES OF PHOTOGRAPHIC DRAWINGS DEVONPORT MAY 5 1840 POSTSCRIPT A I FIND THE INVISIBLE PHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGE ON THE PAPERS PREPARED BY SULPHURA TION BECOMES EVIDENT WITHOUT THE AID OF MERCURIAL VAPOUR BY SIMPLY SOAKING FOR SOME TIME IN A SOLUTION OF CORROSIVE SUBLIMATE THE PICTURE THUS FORMED IS EXTREMELY FAINT BUT THE FACT IS WORTHY OF NOTICE AS IT MAY ULTIMATELY LEAD TO THE DISCOVERY OF A PROCESS BY WHICH THE DISENGAGEMENT OF THE LIGHTCREATED PICTURE MAY BE EFFECTED BY MORE SIMPLE MEANS THAN AT PRESENT B IF PAPERS SATURATED WITH STARCH PRIOR TO BEING WASHED WITH THE SALT OF SILVER AND EXPOSURE TO THE SULPHURETTED HYDROGEN GAS THE SILVER BEING APPLIED ON ONE SIDE ONLY BE WHEN COMPLETED PLACED BETWEEN THE LEAVES OF A PRINTED BOOK AND SUBJECTED TO SOME LITTLE PRESSURE THE PRINTING IS FAITHFULLY COPIED OFF ON THE UNSILVERED SIDE IT IS WITH DIFFICULTY THE LETTERS CAN BE MADE OUT WHEN THE PAPER IS TAKEN FROM THE VO LUME BUT BY IMMERSING IT IN A SOLUTION OF IODINE THEY BECOME A DEEP BLUE VERGING ON A BLACK WHILST THE GROUND REMAINS OF A YELLOW COLOUR WHICH BY THE CONTINUED ACTION OF THE FLUID CHANGES TO A LIGHT VIOLET ON DRYING THE GROUND BECOMES CON SIDERABLY DARKER AND THE PRINTING THOUGH EVIDENT INDISTINCT APPEARING IN SOME POSI TIONS THE LIGHTEST IN OTHERS THE DARKEST PORTIONS OF THE PAPER THESE AND THE FACTS ABOVEMENTIONED RENDER IT PROBABLE THAT WE MAY EVENTUALLY SUCCEED IN COPYING PRINTS C BY MERE JUXTAPOSITION R H MAY 19 1840 334

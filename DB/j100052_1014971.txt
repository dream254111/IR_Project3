J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1014971,SUMMARY AND AFTERWORD,I242694,SUMMARY AND AFTERWORD BY THE EDITORSINCHARGE JOHN A RYAN F ERNEST JOHNSON PERHAPS THE AVERAGE READER OF THIS VOLUME WILL LOOK UPON THE TITLE AS INADEQUATE THE FIRST TWO SEC TIONS MAY NOT SEEM TO FIT VERY APPROP RIATELY UNDER SUCH A HEADING AS IN DUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND THE CHURCHES THE RELATION INDEED IS SOMEWHAT INDIRECT NEVERTHELESS IT IS REAL IN PREPARING THIS VOLUME OUR MAIN OB JECT HAS BEEN TO BRING OUT THE ETHICAL AND IDEALISTIC FACTORS IN THE FIELD OF IN DUSTRIAL RELATIONS WE HAVE SOUGHT TO ASCERTAIN IN HOW FAR THESE FACTORS ARE TAKING THE PLACE OR MAY BE EXPECTED TO TAKE THE PLACE OF PURELY ECONOMIC FORCES IN THE RELATIONS BETWEEN EM PLOYER AND EMPLOYEE AND BETWEEN BOTH OF THESE ON THE ONE HAND AND THE COM MUNITY ON THE OTHER HAND THE FUNC TIONING AND THE PROGRESS OF ETHICAL IN FLUENCES ARE DUE SURELY IN LARGE PART TO THE TEACHING AND THE ACTIVITY OF THE CHURCHES ALTHOUGH THE PAPERS REPRESENT A GREAT VARIETY AND EVEN A CONSIDERABLE OPPOSITION OF VIEWPOINTS THEY PRESENT A CONSIDERABLE AND AN ENCOURAGING AMOUNT OF FUNDAMENTAL AGREEMENT INDEED IT WOULD NOT BE MISLEADING TO SAY THAT THE DIFFERENCES ARE OF EMPHASIS RATHER THAN OF PRINCIPLE NO WRITER AS SERTS THAT INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS SHOULD BE GOVERNED BY PURELY ECONOMIC FORCES OR BY ANY CONCEPTION HOWEVER EUPHE MISTICALLY STATED OF THE SOCALLED LAW OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL THE WRITERS AGREE THAT THE INDUSTRIAL CONFLICT SHOULD BE ADJUSTED ON THE BASIS OF ETHICAL PRINCIPLES AND THE MAJORITY APPEAR TO AGREE THAT THE CHURCH IS DIRECTLY AND PROPERLY CONCERNED WITH THE CONFLICT AND ITS ADJUSTMENT THIS SITUATION REPRESENTS A VAST IMPROVE MENT OVER THAT WHICH OBTAINED A HALF OR EVEN A QUARTER OF A CENTURY AGO IT IS BUT A FEW YEARS SINCE THE MAJORITY OF EMPLOYERS EVEN THOSE WHO WERE CON SIDERED LIBERAL BY THEIR CONTEMPORARIES REGARDED THE EMPLOYEREMPLOYEE RELA TIONSHIP AS ONE OF MASTER AND SERVANT TODAY WE FIND EMPLOYERS OF A FAIRLY CONSERVATIVE TYPE COMMITTED TO THE PRINCIPLE OF CONFERENCE AND TO A DEFINITE PARTICIPATION ON THE PART OF THE WORK ERS IN DETERMINING THE CONDITIONS OF THEIR WORKING LIFE PROGRESS TOWARD A DEMOCRATIC INDUSTRIAL ORDER THE FIRST STEP IN THIS APPROACH TO A MORE DEMOCRATIC INDUSTRIAL ORDER IS FOUND IN THE SIMPLE MACHINERY OF EM PLOYEE REPRESENTATION WHERE A JOINT COMMITTEE OF MANAGEMENT AND MEN MEETS FOR A DISCUSSION OF MATTERS OF MUTUAL CONCERN EVEN WHERE NO AC TUAL POWER IS HELD BY THE WORKERS AND WHERE THE MATTERS OPEN TO DISCUSSION ARE LIMITED TO A VERY NARROW FIELD THE GETTING TOGETHER OF REPRESENTATIVES OF MANAGEMENT AND LABOR FOR A DISCUSSION OF THEIR SEVERAL INTERESTS AND A SETTLE MENT OF THEIR DIFFERENCES CONSTITUTES A DEFINITE APPROACH TO A MORE DEMOCRATIC AND A MORE ETHICAL INDUSTRIAL ORDER THE MORE LIBERAL EMPLOYERS ADD TO THEIR ACCEPTANCE OF THE PRINCIPLE OF CONFERENCE A RECOGNITION OF THE RIGHT OF LABOR TO LARGE SCALE COLLECTIVE BARGAIN ING SO LONG AS THERE ARE WITHIN OUR INDUSTRIAL ORDER MARKED DIFFERENCES OF PROPERTY AND POWER THERE CAN BE NO 141THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY FULL MEASURE OF JUSTICE TO THE WORKERS IF THEY ARE NOT GIVEN THE PRIVILEGE OF FULL AFFILIATION WITH THE LARGEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF THEIR FELLOWS IN THEIR CRAFT OR THEIR INDUSTRY WHEN LIMITED TO A SINGLE ESTABLISHMENT EVEN THOUGH IT MAY BE RELATIVELY LARGE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING CONFERS NO SECURITY UPON THE WORKERS IT IS ONLY IN THE LABOR UNIONWITH A LARGE MEMBERSHIP COVERING A WIDE TERRITORY AND EXERCISING DEFINITE POWER AND INFLUENCE IN THE CRAFT OR INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE THAT THE WORKERS FIND ECONOMIC SECURITY IT MAY BE CONTENDED THAT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IS NOT IN ITSELF A HIGHLY ETHICAL PERFORMANCE THAT IT IS A BALANCE OF FORCES RATHER THAN AN INTERPLAY OF MORAL INFLUENCES YET INDUSTRIAL HIS TORY SHOWS THAT IT IS ONLY WHEN JUSTICE AND SECURITY HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED THAT THE HIGHER FORCES OF OUR COLLECTIVE LIFE ARE LIBERATED FURTHERMORE THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THE PROCESSES OF COL LECTIVE BARGAINING HAVE BROUGHT A GREAT MEASURE OF INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT AND MORAL DISCIPLINE TO THE RANKS OF THE WAGE EARNERS IT IS NOW POSSIBLE TO DISCOVER EVI DENCES OF THE PASSING OVER OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND OF THOSE CRUDER PROC ESSES AND ACTIVITIES WHICH ARE INEVI TABLY INCIDENT TO TRADE UNIONISM AT A TIME WHEN IT IS FORCED TO STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE INTO A BROADER FREER AND MORE GENEROUS INTERPLAY OF INTELLECTUAL AND MORAL INFLUENCES THERE ARE A FEW EXAMPLES IN AMERICA OF INDUSTRIAL OR GANIZATION IN WHICH THE RIGHTS OF THE WORKERS ARE SECURED BY FULL RECOGNITION OF THE UNIONS AND WHERE AT THE SAME TIME THE SOLIDARITY OF THE ESTABLISH MENT IS MAINTAINED THROUGH A JUDICIOUS PLAN OF REPRESENTATION AND SELFGOVERN MENT NOT ONLY SO BUT IN CERTAIN INDUSTRIES NOTABLY IN THE CLOTHING TRADES A WISE AND GENEROUS COOPERATIVE POLICY HAS BROUGHT ABOUT THE VOLUNTARY ACCEPTANCE BY LABOR ORGANIZATIONS OF DEFINITE RESPONSIBILITY FOR EFFICIENT PRO DUCTION TO SINGLE OUT EXAMPLES OF THIS SALUTARY TENDENCY MIGHT SEEM INVIDIOUS IN A STUDY OF THIS KIND NOR WOULD THE LIMITATION OF SPACE PERMIT THEIR ADEQUATE TREATMENT BUT THE PERSON WHO IS LOOKING FOR EVIDENCES OF MORAL PROGRESS IN THE INDUSTRIAL WORLD WILL FIND A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF SUCH DEMONSTRATIONS TO CHALLENGE HIS AT TENTION AS FOR THE PROPER SPHERE OF THE CHURCH IN RELATION TO INDUSTRIAL PROBLEMS AND CONTROVERSIES THE CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS VOLUME MAKE APPARENT A WIDE DIVERGENCE OF OPINION BUT THAT THE PRINCIPLES OF RELIGION ARE SUSCEPTIBLE OF DEFINITE APPLICATION TO INDUSTRIAL PROB LEMS IS SCARCELY ANY LONGER DENIED THE PROPRIETYOF THE ENTRANCE OF CHURCH MEN AS SUCH AND OF RELIGIOUS ORGANIZA TIONS INTO THE FIELD OF RESEARCH WITH REFERENCE TO PARTICULAR CONTROVERSIES IS DISPUTED BY SOME CLERGYMEN AND LAY MEN OF QUITE LIBERAL MIND YET IT IS PROBABLY TRUE THAT THE TENDENCY IS STEADILY TOWARD APPROVAL OF SUCH UN DERTAKINGS AT LEAST SO LONG AS OTHER AVENUES LEADING TO A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF INDUSTRIAL FACTS AND A FAIR APPRAISAL OF THE ISSUES INVOLVED ARE LACKING IT APPEARS THAT IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE THE CHURCHES WILL BE CALLED UPON TO RENDER MORE RATHER THAN LESS SPECIFIC SERVICE IN INFORMING THEIR PEOPLE CON CERNING INDUSTRIAL CONDITIONS AND IN TERPRETING EVENTS IN THE LIGHT OF THEIR MORAL SIGNIFICANCE IT IS CERTAIN HOW EVER THAT THE CHURCH CAN SUCCESSFULLY PERFORM ITS MISSION ONLY BY MAINTAIN ING A TOTALLY IMPARTIAL ATTITUDE TOWARD ALL THE PARTICIPANTS IN CONTROVERSY AND BY REFRAINING IN THE DISCHARGE OF HER PROPHETIC DUTY FROM THOSE METHODS OF STRIFE AND AGGRESSIVE HARSHNESS WHOSE EVIL EFFECTS IN OUR INDUSTRIAL LIFE IT IS ONE OF THE CHURCHS CHIEF TASKS TO REMOVE IT IS GRATIFYING TO FIND WRITERS OF LEARN ING JUDGMENT AND EXPERIENCE BEARING 142SUMMARY AND AFTERWORD TESTIMONY TO THE INCREASING PART PLAYED BY RIGHT AND REASON AND THE CONSTRAINTS OF HUMAN FELLOWSHIP IN THE SETTLEMENT OF INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES AND THE CURRENTS OF INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENTTESTIMONY WHICH AMPLY JUSTIFIES THE RECENT EFFORTS OF THE CHURCHES TO RAISE THESE MATTERS TO A HIGHER PLANE THE MOST FRUITFUL LINES OF EFFORT WILL DOUBTLESS BE DISCOV ERED IN THE COURSE OF THE MINISTRY OF THE LOCAL CHURCH TO THE WORKERS IN ITS OWN COMMUNITY THE MEASURELESS POSSI BILITIES OF SUCH A MINISTRY HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED IN THESE PAGES 143

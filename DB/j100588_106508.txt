THIS RECOMMENDS IT PECULIARLY TO THE ATTENTION OF ALL THOSE WHO WISH TO HAVE THE PLEASURE OF READING THE ENGLISH CLASSIC AUTHORS WITH GRACE AND PROPRIETY OR TO WRITE AND SPEAK COR RECTLY OF THOSE GENTLEMEN WHO ARE INTENDED FOR THE NAVY THE ARMY THE PUBLICOFFICE OR THE COUNTINGHOUSE OR WHOSE JUVENILE STUDIES MAY HAVE BEEN OBLITERATED BY AN EARLY INTRO DUCTION INTO THOSE SITUATIONS AND OF ALL THOSE WHO MAY HAVE BEEN DEPRIVED OF THE ADVANTAGES OF A LIBERAL EDUCATION THEY ARE EFFECTUALLY CURED OF ANY DEFECTS IN PRONUNCIATION WHICH DO NOT ARISE FROM AN IMPERFECTION IN THE ORGANS OF SPEECH AND INSTEAD OF PROVINCIAL DISAGREEABLE OR ABSURD HABITS THEY ACQUIRE AN ENERGETIC A PERSUASIVE AND A GRACEFUL MANNER OF SPEAKING READING AND RECITING ABOVE ALL THE YOUNGER PUPILS RECEIVE THIS SINGULAR AND IMPORTANT ADVANTAGE THAT THEIR MINDS ARE OPENED MORE EARLY THEIR REASON IS ASSISTED IN ITS EXERTIONS AND DIRECTED TO SUCH OBJECTS AS NATURALLY PRO MOTE THE PERFECTION AND THE HAPPINESS OF HUMAN BEINGS THIS METHOD IS EQUALLY WELL ADAPTED TO BOTH SEXES THOSE AD VANCED IN LIFE MAY RECEIVE INSTRUCTION PRIVATELY AS USUAL AND LADIES WILL BE ATTENDED AT THEIR OWN HOUSES APPLICATION MAY BE MADE TO MR SMEATHMAN AT HIS CHAM BERS NO 14 CLEMENTSINN OF WHOM IN A FEW DAYS MAY BE HAD A SHORT TREATISE ON THE NATURE OF ELOQUENCE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF LEARNING TO READ SPEAK AND WRITE OUR OWN LANGUAGE INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHERS WITH A PLAN OF HIS MODE OF TEACHING AND THE ADVANTAGES TO BE DERIVED FROM IT THE FOLLOWING ARE DETACHED EXTRACTS FROM THE ABOVEMEN TIONED TREATISE 1  THOSE3  THOSE WHO HAVE NOT STUDIED AND BEEN EXERCISED IN READING  SPEAKING OR COMPOSING IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGE WILL NOT DO  EITHER IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO CLAIM OR DESERVE ATTENTION  AND IT IS THE TALENT OF PERFORMING THEM WITH EASE ENERGY  AND PROPRIETY WHICH WE CALL ELOQUENCE  PEOPLE ARE USUALLY VERY SOLICITOUS TO HAVE THEIR CHILDREN IN  STRUCTED IN ALL THOSE LIBERAL ARTS WHICH ARE DEEMED REQUISITE TO  PERFECT THEM AS GENTLEMEN AND SCHOLARS AND SURELY AS NO  THING CONTRIBUTES MORE TO THIS INTENTION THEY WOULD NOT OMIT  ORATORY IF THEY THOUGHT IT WAS TO BE LEARNED THEY LISTEN  WITH RAPTURE TO THE CHARMS OF ELOQUENCE BUT ARE NOT AWARE  THAT IT IS IN THEIR POWER TO PROCURE THIS INESTIMABLE TALENT  FOR THOSE WHO ARE THE OBJECTS OF THEIR INCESSANT CARE AND DAILY  ANXIETY  THIS CAN ONLY ARISE FROM THE ERRONEOUS IDEA THAT ORATORY IS  NOT TO BE TAUGHT OR ACQUIRED YET NO ART IS MORE SIMPLE IN  ITS PRINCIPLES OR CLEARER IN ITS RULES AND NO RULES ARE MORE  EASILY REDUCED TO PRACTICE OR MORE CERTAINLY PRACTISED WITH  SUCCESS  IT IS GRANTED THAT PEOPLE MAY IMPROVE THEMSELVES MUCH  BY PRIVATE DECLAMATION THE ART OF ELOQUENCE HOWEVER  IS IN THIS RESPECT LIKE FENCING IN WHICH A MAN CAN LEARN  VERY LITTLE BY PUSHING AGAINST A WALL HE MAY INDEED  STRENGTHEN HIS MUSCLES AND ENABLE HIMSELF TO BEAR THE  FATIGUE BUT IT IS BY FREQUENT EXERTION WITH A MASTER ONLY  THAT HE CAN EXPECT TO ACQUIRE SKILL A 2  IT4  IT IS FROM THE FRIENDLY OBSERVATIONS THE ORAL INFORMATION  THE FREQUENT CONTENTIONS AND THE UNRESTRAINED CORRECTIONS  OF A SKILFUL COMPANION THAT A STUDENT IN ORATORY CAN DERIVE  ESSENTIAL IMPROVEMENT WRITING ALONE CAN NO MORE COMMU  NICATE THE ART THAN IT CAN SPEECH TO THE DUMB  THOSE THEREFORE WHO EDUCATE THEIR CHILDREN FOR EMINENT  STATIONS IN LIFE WITH THE HOPE THAT THEY WILL ONE DAY RENDER  THEMSELVES CONSPICUOUS IN THE SENATE THE CHURCH OR THE  COURTS OF LAW AND JUSTICE WITHOUT HAVING THEM GROUNDED IN  THE FIRST PRINCIPLES OF ELOQUENCE EXPECT TO REAP WHERE THEY  HAVE NOT SOWN THEY MUST IN ALL PROBABILITY BE DISAPPOINT  ED  THERE IS SCARCE A MAN OF A MODERATE AGE AND CAPACITY NOT  BORN WITH SOME INVINCIBLE IMPERFECTION IN THE ORGANS OF  SPEECH WHO MAY NOT IN TWELVE MONTHS BE ENABLED TO COM  MUNICATE HIS THOUGHTS WITH PLEASURE TO HIS AUDIENCE AND  CREDIT TO HIMSELF OR SO TO READ THE LITURGY AS TO EXCITE  DEVOTION IN THE MOST LUKEWARM AND TO CONFIRM IT BY A NA  TURAL PERSUASIVE AND CONVINCING MANNER OF DELIVERING THE  GREAT AND ESSENTIAL TRUTHS OF RELIGION AND HOW MUCH THIS  IS TO BE WISHED IS LEFT TO THE OPINION OF ALL WHO HAVE HEARD  THE DISGUSTING AND UNEDIFYING MANNER IN WHICH THE FINEST  COMPOSITIONS ARE GENERALLY DELIVERED IN OUR PUBLIC PLACES OF  WORSHIP AND SEEN THE AWKWARD FIGURES SOME OF OUR LEARNED  SENATORS MAKE WHEN THEY ATTEMPT TO SPEAK IN PARLIAMENT  WE HAVE HITHERTO TREATED ONLY OF THE MOST OBVIOUS ADVAN  TAGES ARISING FROM THE STUDY OF ELOQUENCE ON A CLOSER  VIEW5  VIEW MANY OTHER IMPORTANT BENEFITS WILL BE FOUND TO BE  DERIVED FROM IT OF THESE OPENING THE MIND IMPROVING  THE HEART AND INFUSING A DESIRE OF KNOWLEDGE DESERVE PAR  TICULAR NOTICE SUCH IS THE TENDENCY EFFECT AND BENEFIT OF  THE MODE OF INSTRUCTION HERE RECOMMENDED FOR AS IT APPLIES  DIRECTLY TO THE UNDERSTANDING WITHOUT BURTHENING THE ME  MORY OR PERPLEXING THE MIND THE YOUNGEST PUPILS RECUR  TO IT WITH DELIGHT AND ITS UNCOMMON SUCCESS WHEN AT  TEMPTED HAS ARISEN FROM THE IMMEDIATE CONVICTION WHICH  THEY FEEL THAT OUR PATH TO KNOWLEDGE IS PLEASANT AND  THE POSSESSION OF IT HIGHLY ADVANTAGEOUS AND DESIRABLE  OUR YOUTH ARE GENERALLY VERY DEFECTIVE IN THOSE POLITE  BRANCHES OF KNOWLEDGE WITHOUT WHICH CLASSICAL LEARNING IS  OF LITTLE USE THEIR MANNERS FREQUENTLY CONTINUE ROUGH AND  PUERILE WHEN THEY OUGHT TO BE GRACEFUL AND MANLY THEIR  SPEECH INARTICULATE OR SLOVENLY DISSONANT OR DEFECTIVE DIS  AGREEABLE AND OFTEN UNINTELLIGIBLE AND VERY FEW EVEN  AMONG THOSE WHO ARE GOOD SCHOLARS CAN READ OR WRITE THEIR  OWN LANGUAGE WITH EASE OR PROPRIETY AN ACCOMPLISHMENT  ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO THOSE WHO WISH TO DERIVE ANY ADVAN  TAGE FROM EXTENSIVE KNOWLEDGE OR PROFOUND ERUDITION  YOUNG PEOPLE ARE NATURALLY EMULOUS OF THE COMPANY OF  PERSONS RESPECTABLE EITHER FOR THEIR RANK OR ABILITIES AND IF  THEY PASS THEIR TIME WITH LOW OR IGNORANT PEOPLE IT IS FOR  WANT OF BEING PROPERLY INTRODUCED AND ACCUSTOMED TO MIX IN  THE CONVERSATION OF MEN OF POLISHED MANNERS AND LIBERAL AC  COMPLISHMENTS  THE MODE OF INSTRUCTION HERE RECOMMENDED MUST NECES  SARILY IN ITS COURSE REMOVE THESE DEFECTS AND THE PREJUDICES  INTAILED6  INTAILED ON THEM AND PROMOTE THE ACQUISITION OF THOSE  USEFULL ARTS ON WHICH THE SUCCESS OF LIFE SO MUCH DEPENDS  IN THE PROSECUTION OF IT THEIR CURIOSITY IS EXCITED AND DI  RECTED TO PROPER OBJECTS AND A DESIRE FOR GENERAL KNOWLEDGE  THE GREAT FOUNDATION OF EXCELLENCE IMPLANTED BY MAKING THEM  ACQUAINTED WITH SUCH REMARKABLE THINGS IN NATURE AND ART  AS ARE WORTHY OF ATTENTION INSTEAD OF A SLOVENLY OR UNGRACE  FULL MODE OF SPEAKING THEY ARE TAUGHT TO DELIVER THEIR SENTI  MENTS WITH PROPRIETY AND PRECISION ACCORDING TO TIMES AND  CIRCUMSTANCES CONSEQUENTLY THEIR MANNER WHEN IMPROPER  IS REFORMED INSENSIBLY AND WITHOUT APPEARING AN OBJECT OF  ATTENTION THEIR MINDS ARE CULTIVATED BY FREQUENT APPEALS  TO THEIR UNDERSTANDING AND THEIR JUDGEMENTS REGULATED BY  THE CONSTANT HABIT OF OBSERVATION AND REFLECTION EXERCISED  IN A MINUTE ENQUIRY INTO THE TRUTH AND PROPRIETY OF SUCH  THOUGHTS AS THEY ARE DIRECTED TO IN THE COURSE OF THEIR STUDY  THUS BEING EARLY QUALIFIED FOR THE COMPANY OF WELL BRED AND  INTELLIGENT PEOPLE THEY APPEAR WITH BECOMING CONFIDENCE AND  SATISFACTION ON ALL OCCASIONS

ZOOLOGICAL LABORATORY YALE UNIVERSITY In view of the fact that the study of rhythms and endomixis in Paramcecium was made chiefly on my long pedigreed race of Paramcecium aurelia it has been suggested by a couple of authors that the reorganization process may be something peculiar to this race perhaps resulting from long subjection to conditions which preclude the possibility of conjugation This assumption however was rendered exceedingly improbable from the data presented by Woodruff and Erdmann in their original complete paper which showed that the same reorganization process was resumed in all the lines within a relatively short time after conjugation was allowed to occur in a subculture of the main race and also that the phenomenon was observed early in the culture of a race which was secured by Erdmann from Berlin Germany Further Erdmann and Woodruff2 in a paper on endomixis in Paramcecium caudatum stated incidentally that endomixis had been found in two new races of Paramcecium aurelia immediately upon their isolation The above data more than justify the early conclusion of Woodruff and Erdmann that this reorganization process is a normal phenomenon and probably occurs in all races of the species Paramcecium aurelia 3 but in connection with other work on Paramcecium it has been necessary to employ various races for study and the purpose of the present paper is to record briefly the additional data bearing on the points under discussion This may be most readily accomplished by considering seratim the graphs of the life histories which show the rhythms and the occurrence of endomixis in the respective cultures Since 1 Journal of Experimental Zoology Vol I7 No 4 1914 2 Journal of Experimental Zoology Vol 20 No 2 I916 3 Ibid 1914 p 474 5ILORANDE LOSS WOODRUFF the methods of conducting the cultures plotting the graphs etc has been fully described in earlier papers from this laboratory the reader is referred to them for details of technique It is only necessary to emphasize here that the occurrence of endo FIG I mixis has been determined of course in each case by the cyto logical study of animals preserved almost daily from each culture during the periods under discussion Race I Woodruffs Main CultureIsolated May I I907 at Williamstown Mass and carried in pedigreed culture to FIG 2 date July I917 During this period of more than ten years it has attained over 6ooo generations without conjugation The discovery of endomixis was made on this race and full details 52RHYTHMS AND ENDOMIXIS IN PARAMAECIUM AURELIA have been presented in earlier papers Fig I1 gives a typical graph of a subculture showing the relation of rhythms and endomixis Race II Berlin RaceIsolated by Erdmann in Berlin For details see Woodruff and Erdmann I914 Race III Oberlin RaceThe initial animals of this pedi greed culture was supplied by Professor R A Budington of Oberlin Ohio The culture was started October 8 1914 and was discontinued after nearly two years during which time over 1000ooo generations were obtained Fig 2 is a graph of the average division rate of the four lines of this culture again averaged for each of the first 21 fiveday periods of its life when it was being intensively studied with reference to the occurrence of rhythms and endomixis The graph shows four rhythms and at the low point between each endomixis occurred It is to be 4 3 2  r E E FIG 3 noted that the reorganization process appeared during the fifth fiveday period after the isolation of the culture thus showing once more that this phenomenon is not dependent upon long subjection to culture conditions for its genesis The length of the rhythmic periods for this race is also essentially the same as in Race I cf Fig i Race IV Bryn Mawr RaceThe animal which started 1

Mawr Pa The culture was discontinued at the 650oth generation on February 8 I916 Fig 3 shows the relationship of rhythms and endo mixis during the first eightyfive days of the culture when the animals were being examined for the reorganization process The results fully substantiate those obtained from previous races The last interrhythm period shown in the diagram is apparently longer than usualthough it is possible that endomixis was overlooked about the I5th fiveday period Race V Oxford RaceCulture started from material se cured at Oxford Ohio on July I6 I915 and discontinued on August 7 I916 at the ioooth generation The division rate of the culture is shown in Fig 4 for the first 44 fiveday periods of 2 1  r E E E E FIG 5 its life During this time nine rhythms occurred at each of which endomixis was observed It is hoped that readers who may possess doubts concerning rhythms and endomixis will carefully consider this graph Race VI Woods Hole RaceThis race was obtained by Dr G A Baitsell at Woods Hole Mass and its pedigreed culture was begun on August II 1915 and discontinued on Jan uary I4 I916 at the 305th generation Fig 5 gives the graph of the division rate of this culture throughout its existence1 1 The division rate is plotted consistently one quarter of a division per day too fast for every fiveday period owing to a draughtsmans error An E should be inserted in the first period56 LORANDE LOSS WOODRUFF Endomixis occurred as soon as the culture was started and recurred at the usual intervals The animal was not studied cytologically during the 14th fiveday period so that endomixis is not indicated by an E in this period on the chart but from the character of the curve there can be little doubt that an examination of stained specimens would have revealed it In a word then the data from every culture of Paramcecium aurelia isolated from as diverse localities as Ohio and Germany which we have studied prove beyond doubt I believe that endo mixis is a normal periodic phenomenon which occurs in all races of Paramcecium aurelia

is the capacity of the pure theory of Political Economy for progress There seems to be a growing impression that as a mere state ment of principles this science will soon be fairly com plete There remains indeed to be added to the list of accepted truths a theory of Distribution but materials at least for such a theory are to be found in recent liter ature Explanations of wages and interest that cannot be far from the truth have been offered and if it shall soon appear that any of these is demonstrating its correct ness and taking in the science the assured place that the modern theory of Value has already won there will be a disposition to say that at last the theory of Economics has reached the condition in which with only minor changes and additions it is likely to remain It is of course true that the theories of Value Wages Interest and Profits constitute in so far as importance goes twothirds of the theoretical science of Economics2 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS It is over questions of distribution that social classes con tend with each other Is property robbery Does society need revolutionizing The answer depends on the ques tion whether under free competition wages are the spe cific product of labor and this is one of the many points that are to be decided by a theory of Distribution If therefore we are not in error in thinking that scientific thought is now on the right track in connection with the problems of Distribution and if there is soon to be a unanimity of view concerning the laws of Wages In terest and Profits then indeed it is of importance to know whether any very great theoretical work is still in the future On the supposition that some one of the theories of Distribution that are now candidates for acceptance will soon reveal its own correctness or that some modification of one of these will be adopted or that out of them all some eclectic theory will be formed that will win assent will the pure theory of Economics have further and large achievements immediately before it  There seems to be an impression that it will not It is with this view that I take issue The great com ing development of economic theory is to take place as I venture to assert through the statement and the solution of dynamic problems Static problems have heretofore had most attention That which in Ricardos studies figured as a  natural value  is really a static value It is a value that would be realized in a market if certain changes that are transforming society were stopped and if the prices of goods were allowed to reach and keep the rates that a perfectly free competition would then estab lish The wages and interest that in such studies would be regarded as normal are in the same way static wages and interest The greater problems of the future concern dynamic values and dynamic wages and interest The difference between static problems and dynamicTHE FUTURE OF ECONOMIC THEORY 3 ones becomes apparent if we divide the science of Political Economy in a natural way This is a new mode of divid ing the science and it involves the abandoning of the timehonored plan of separating the whole of Political Economy into four parts treating respectively of Produc tion Distribution Exchange and Consumption The dif ficulty with this mode of dividing the science is that it gives parts that are not distinct from each other Pro duction indeed as it is carried on in a social state is a process that ilicludes both exchange and distribution Production is the bringing of commodities into existence and in any state except the most primitive one it is ac complished by a division of labor The producer is per sonally a specialist selling an article or a part of an article and buying what he needs with the proceeds Only society in its entirety is an allaround creator of goods This is equivalent to saying that social produc tion is accomplished by means of exchanges The pass ing of goods from hand to hand enables all society to make all goods and the two expressions Division of Labor on the one hand and Exchange on the other merely describe in two different ways the organized proc ess of creating wealth It is contrasted with the method of isolated and independent production Let a thing stay in one mans hands until it is finished and in use and pro duction is not yet socialized But let it pass from hand to hand in the making and it is so Society in its entirety is the one producer of wealth and exchange is the social izing element in production It is a feature of the more comprehensive process There is a kind of distribution that merely adjusts the incomes of what may be called industrial groups in their entirety and does not settle questions of wages and inter est When wheat is high in price the whole group of wheatraisers gets a large return How much of it goes to laborers and how much to the owners or the tenants of4 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS farms is a further question but highpriced wheat means much money to be apportioned somewhere among them In like manner dear steel means much money for the whole group of steelmakers The study of Value is then a study of Group Distribution Yet it is a study of a feat ure of exchanges and these are a feature of social pro duction In another way is the distributing process identified with production since if modern theories are not wrong the share of wealth that falls to any producing agent tends under natural law to equal the amount that he creates A mans pay tends to equal the value of the product or fraction of a product that can be specifically im puted to him The whole study of Distribution is ill this light nothing but a study of Specific Production It traces the wealth that society as a whole creates backward to the agents that have brought each specific part of it into ex istence Production itself is a synthesis in which count less agents bring each its contribution to the grand total of the worlds income Distribution is merely the undo ing of this combining process It is an analysis and traces the wealth that has been synthetically created back to its ultimate sources All of the process of distribution then is included in production The adjustment of values is group distribu tion but it is also a feature of exchange Exchange is merely the socializing feature of production We cannot here stop to show how completely entangled with each other are the first three of the four traditional processes that it has been customary to treat in separate parts of the science It is however clearly impossible to account for the fact that a man who wields a pick in excavating ground for a cellar gets 125 a day without discussing subjects that belong to the theories of Exchange and Dis tribution yet at no time would the economist cease to be within the field of Production He would have toTHE FUTURE OF ECONOMIC THEORY 5 ascertain how much the mans group produces and what part he personally contributes to the groups product Not unfit for use as descriptive terms but absolutely unfit for use as subjects of distinct division of the science of Political Economy are the terms Production Distribu tion and Exchange Consumption is not an organized process at all We make things collectively but we use them each man for himself We like to eat together indeed and to enjoy many things in company but we do not cooperate in eating as we do in producing food and other commodities Consumption is an individualistic operation and a treatise that limits itself to a distinctively social economy would not treat of it at all It would assume that consumption is going on and that production has no other object than that consumption may go on but it would not include in itself any discussion of the consuming process Produc tion on the other hand in the civilized world must go on in an organized way and exchange and distribution are involved in the organizing of it Production includes all of the economic process that is strictly social Consump tion is not a good term to describe any part of such a strictly social economy Let us see whether the science can be divided on an other plan There are three distinct kinds of force work ing together in social economics If we study them sepa rately we shall resolve economic science into three divi sions the boundaries of which have been drawn by nat ure Man modifies matter by production and matter modifies man through consumption These processes do not necessarily require any organization on the part of the men who impart and then receive the impressions All this could be accomplished by an isolated man or by men living together for protection or the mere pleasures of association without any system of exchange of prod ucts Let every one make his own goods and consume them and an economic life of a certain kind is complete6 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS The distinctive feature of such a life is that it estab lishes direct relations between the individual man and nature Every man subdues for himself a part of his ma terial environment and he gets the direct service that this bit of nature when thus subdued can render There are no disguises thrown over the relation that workers sustain to the earth Obvious dependence on nature ob vious independence of other men is the rule of every ones economic life Out of materials furnished by the earth each producer creates his own income and there are no problems of distribution connected with it Yet in this mode of living which puts every man face to face with nature there is room for the action of all of the more fundamental laws of economics Here is a hunter in a primeval forest converting the flesh of animals into food and their skins into clothing and shelter He is creating something that can be defined as wealth It has the essential marks that analysis detects in the wealth that crowds the shops of the modern city The man uses capital and includes in his equipment both the fixed and the circulating varieties of it His consumption has its laws and the chief of them is the one that calls for vari ety in the things consumed He must not make and use too much of one kind of product and too little of another He must guard against glutting some wants and letting others go unsatisfied if the wealth that he creates is to do him much good There is a distinct set of economic laws the action of which is not dependent on organization They are fun damental and what we have now to note is that they are universal  They act in the economy of the most ad vanced state as well as inl that of the most primitive Wealth has everywhere the same distinguishing marks The producing and the consuming of it are always subject to the same general conditions The first natural division of economic science should present the universal laws ofTHE FUTURE OF ECONOMIC THEORY 7 wealth It should discuss the more general laws of pro duction and all the laws of consumption There is next to be studied a second set of phenomena They are traceable to a further set of forces and these originate in relations between man and man They are made to work wherever persons begin to exchange prod ucts This organizes society in groups or specific indus tries Let some men produce food and others build huts and let them exchange products with each other and things happen that are not accounted for by the laws of that general economy in which the direct relations of man to nature are explained Exchanges involve the deter mining of values and these as we have seen fix the terms of group distribution The organization of society is further extended when within each group or specific industry there are em ployers paying wages to the men who labor and interest to those who furnish capital Distribution in a broad definition of that term is that which results from organiz ing the wealthcreating powers The division of econom ics that treats of it will first deal with group distribution which depends on exchanges It will describe the forma tion of the groups account for the terms on which they buy and sell from each other and show on what the income of each of them depends It will then deal with that final distribution which takes place within each sub group and which fixes the wages the interest and the profits that are there received This is equivalent to showing what becomes of the income that comes to a group as a whole Laborers get some of it capitalists get some and entrepreneurs get the remainder Broadly con ceived and made to include a description of the system of industrial groups and of their dealings the science of Dis tribution embraces the Social Laws of Economics It tells all that happens in consequence of the one fact that society has organized itself for Production The term Distribu8 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS tion cannot be used as the title of a scientific division if the use of it carries with it the idea that what is treated under this title is not Production and is not Exchange Distribution is a process that in its completeness in cludes Exchange It falls itself entirely within Produc tion It is not best to characterize the second natural division of economic science as the science of Distribution since the idea of distinctness from Production and Ex change attaches itself in the public mind to this term It is best to describe it as the division that treats of the Social Laws of Economics as distinct front the general laws When we know what happens in consequence of the economic actions and reactions that are taking place between man and nature we have the content of the first division of the science We need further to know what takes place in consequence of relations between manl and man and this will give us the content of the second division It is conceivable that production might go on in an organized way without any change in the character of the operation Men might conceivably produce to the end of time the same kinds of goods and they might do it by the same processes Their tools and materials might never change and they might not alter either for the better or for the worse the amount of wealth that their industry would yield Social production can be thought of as static In such a changeless mode of social industry distribu tion with all that it involves would take place Groups would exchange products and each would be dependent on the value of its own goods for the amount of its col lective income The price of agricultural produce would determine the income of farmers and the price of ore would fix that of miners The gains of a group as a whole would be divided among the subgroups composing it and would then by a further operation be parted into wages interest and profitsTHE FUTURE OF ECONOMIC THEORY 9 We saw that what are called natural standards of val ues and natural or normal rates of wages interest and profits are in reality static rates They are identical with those which would be realized if a society were per fectly organized but were free from the disturbances that progress causes Far more than classical economists were aware of is involved in a thoroughgoing study of what they called natural values Reduce society to a stationary state let industry go on with entire freedom make labor and capital absolutely mobile as free to move from employment to employ ment as they are supposed to be in the theoretical world that figures in Ricardos studies and you will have a regime of natural values They are the values about which rates are forever fluctuating in the shops of com mercial cities You will also have a regime of natural wages and interest and these are the standards about which the rates of pay for labor and capital are always hovering in actual mills fields mines The terms nat ural  and  normal  and  static as used in this connec tion are synonymous The division of economic science that presents natural standards of values wages and in terest ought consciously to take the shape of a static theory Such a theory would treat of Distribution as it would go on if there were taking place none of those grand disturbances  changes in the mode of production that are forever causing market quotations to vary from the natural standards of the classical economists A static state is imaginary All actual societies are dynamic and those that we have principally to study are highly so Heroically theoretical is the study that cre ates in imagination a static society Unceasing changes in the actual world thrust labor and capital from time to time out of one occupation and into another In each in dustry that is carried on they again and again change the modes of production and the kinds and the quantities of10 QUARTERLY JO URNAL OF ECONOMICS the goods produced Yet this does not invalidate the conclusions of a static theory Static laws are real laws The forces that would work in a world that should be held in a fixed shape and made to act forever in a fixed manner operate still in the changing world of reality We can always see them working in connection with other forces but we can only imagine them working alone We study them separately in order that we may understand one part of what goes on in dynamic societies To do this we create in imagination a static society and it is a heroic but necessary application of the isolating method Only by reasons of its omissions is the imaginary and static state unlike the real and dynamic one All the forces that would work in the unchanging world are not only working in the changeful one but are even the dom inant forces of it They do not keep values exactly at the natural standards but they keep them fluctuating about those standards and they keep real wages and in terest always comparatively near to the natural rates We have described the boundaries of two of the natural divisions of economic science The first treats of uni versal phenomena and the second of phenomena that re sult merely from organization and not from any change or progress in the character of the organization Starting with those laws of economics which act whether humanity is organized or not we next study the forces that result from organization whether it is progressive or not This latter study gives us a theory of Social Economic Statics Finally it is necessary to study the forces of progress To influences that would act if society were in a station ary state we must add those that act only as society is thrown into a condition of movement and disturbance This will give us a science of Social Economic Dynamics It will bring the society that figures in our theory into a condition that is like that of the actual world It willTIE FUTURE OF ECONOMIC THEORY 11 supply what a static theory openly and intentionally puts out of sight namely changes that alter the mode of production and act on the very structure of society it self A study of these changes is the content of the third natural division of economic science Wants are changing and the kinds of wealth that are produced must change with them New mechanical proc esses are coming into use Machines supplant hand labor and efficient machines displace inferior ones New mo tive powers are taken into service and new raw materials are used Population increases and migrates taking with it some of the increase of its wealth Large industries grow up and crowd small ones out of the field The earth becomes crowded with life and wealth An ade quate study of such changes is impossible unless it is pre ceded by a study of natural or static standards of value wages interest and profits Not any of these changes suppresses the action of static forces nor do all of them together do so Not one jot nor one tittle shall fall from the law of natural values or from that of natural rates of wages interest and profits A different set of forces is acting in connection with the static ones and real values wages are the resultant of the two kinds of force In advancing to the study of dynamic phenomena our theory completes itself and the effect is to make it fully interpret the world of fact A theoretical dynamic world is exactly like the actual world if the theory that constructs it is a valid and complete one It has the elements of disturbance and of friction to which men of business point as influences that invalidate theoretical conclusions If the study of it were carried to completion it would furnish what has heretofore been lacking namely a science of economic friction and dis turbance In so far as method is concerned a theory of Economic Dynamics must use deduction as did the theories of theQUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONO3IICS Ricardian school It must base itself on the conclusions of Economic Statics which as we have seen are uncoml promisingly theoretical Yet realism is the striking trait of the dynamic theory It includes in its field of view just the elements that have been needed to make a deduc tive economic science fully interpret the world of fact and satisfy practical minds In the markets of all parts of the world where compe tition rules the standards about which prices fluctuate are set by static forces and the fluctuations are accounted for by dynamic ones Actual prices are now above the standards and now below them A pendulum is now on one side of an imaginary vertical line and now on the other The vertical line coincides with the position that it would hold if it were under the influence of static forces only Its oscillations are due to dynamic forces and these can be measured if we first know the nature of the static forces and the position to which if they were acting alone they would bring the pendulum The oscillations of prices about the natural standards can be accounted for only by a similar plan of study We must have at the outset the static standards of price to which the market tends to conform The same thing is true of natural wages and interest and of the fluctuations about these standards It is dynamic causes that produce varia tions This however is not the largest effect of dynamic forces We shall not have learned the most important thing about them when we have accounted for the devia tions from natural rates that actual values wages and interest show We shall further see that dynamic forces create new conditions in which static forces must work In these new conditions natural values cannot continue to be what they were in the former conditions The price of cotton cloth that is entirely natural when this fabric is made by hand is far from being so when it is made byTHE FUTURE OF ECONOMIC THEORY 13 machinery The normal price of cotton cloth fell in conl sequence of the inventions of Watt Hargreaves Ark wright and Crompton Before these men did their work the price of the cloth was fluctuating about one natural standard afterwards it fluctuated about another The normal level of wages is rising and that of interest is fall ing in consequence of farreaching dynamic influences At any one time there is one standard of value wages and interest set by static forces and at that time the temporary fluctuations of actual rates about these stand ards are due to dynamic causes At a later time it will be found that the standards themselves have undergone a change  and these grander effects are the most important ones that are attributable to dynamic forces A theory of mere disturbance and variation is indeed included in the science of Economic Dynamics but the more impor tant thin that is included in it is a theory of progress The normal wealth of the world will be greater and the natural level of wages will be far higher in the year 2000 than they are today if the greater forces of economic dy namics shall continue to work Is it not already clear that this field of investigation is an indefinitely fruitful one  It would become clearer that this is the fact if it were practicable here to describe in a detailed way the particular problems that have to be solved in a theory of Social Economic Dynamics They include every possibility of gain that can come to human ity by economic change They are essentially new prob lems because the prevailing mode of economic study has not heretofore isolated them brought them clearly into view and afforded the data for solving them Not with out references to change and progress has been the theory that has formed itself on the old and baffling plan of a fourfold division of the whole science into Production Distribution Exchange and Consumption Statics and dynamics are blindly commingled in such theories An14 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS adequate treatment of change and progress is needed and it must be preceded by a thoroughgoing treatment of purely static forces We must get the normal standards of value wages and interest if we are to measure the de viations from them that rates show in the business world What is far more important is that we should have the natural standards of today compare with them the stand ards of tomorrow and measure and account for differ ences between the two sets The reduction of progress to a sciencesuch is the work of a theory of Social Eco nomic Dynamics JOHN BATES CLARK COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY

EMPLOYEES TO TER MINATE THEIR EMPLOYMENT IN ORDER TO JOIN THE UNIONWhile tile privilege of the individual to work or not to work was recognized the common law abhorred a conspiracy and a concerted refusal of several journeymentailors to work at so much per diem in order to secureNOTES higher wages was held to be an indictable conspiracy This view is also sanctioned in several early American decisions2 The doctrine of these cases would obviously condemn any strike but the unfairness of the rule was too patent to be long endured and in due course the courts declared the workers privilege to combine to better their condi tions and for proper purposes to quit woik in concert in order to secure their ends3 But in determining the scope of the privilege due regard should be had for the conflicting interests of others When A declines to continue in the employ of B he is merely exer cising the privilege of every individual to terminate an employment at will But when A induces C to cease working for B while C is exer cising the same privilege with the same immunities as did A in the first case there is the additional element that A is inducing the exercise of this privilege True the consequences to B may be the same in both cases but it may be desirable in the interest of individual freedom to permit A or C to exercise this privilege arbitrarily and yet quite undesirable to permit A without justification to induce C to exercise the privilege So it has been held that for A maliciously to entice custom ers or employees from B solely because of his desire to injure B and not to benefit himself is actionable4 But where A induces Bs customers or employees to leave B in order to obtain their trade or services for himself the courts have declared the resulting loss to B to fall within the principle of damnum absque injuria The cases are distinguish able only upon the ground that in the latter group the benefit to A justifies the injury to B6 However A must not employ unfair means The King v Journeymen Taylors of Cambridge 1721 8 Mod 10 The following reasoning of the court is interesting yet it is not for the refusing to work but for conspiring that they are indicted and a con spiracy of any kind is illegal although the matter about which they con spired might have been lawful for them or any of them to do if they had not conspired to do it as appears in the case of The Tubwomen v The Brewers of London a No citation follows a in the footnote of the tailors case The case of The Tubwomen which is notable because of the mystery which veils its identity is discussed in an article by William A Purrington in 3 Columbia Law Rev 447 People v Fisher N Y 1835 14 Wend 9 In this case it was held that a combination of journeymenshoemakers to raise wages violated a penal statute forbidding a conspiracy 6 To commit any act injurious    to trade or commerce For other early American cases in accord see 3 Columbia Law Rev 447 Commonwealth v Hunt 1842 45

1898 A C 1 and the present case it may be stated in a single sentence In Allen v Flood the purpose of the defendant was by the acts complained of to promote his own trade interest which it was held he was entitled to do although injurious to his competitors whereas in the present case while it is clear 253COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW to induce C to exercise his privilege7 Furthermore it does not follow that an accruing benefit excuses under all circumstances a disturbance of relations between others Thus if A persuades C to violate a con tract with B A is not inducing the exercise of a privilege but a breach of duty by 0 and such conduct the law does not countenance8 And it would also seem that there may be cases where the benefit to A is too remote or too speculative to justify the wilful disturbance of relations at will between B and C9 It is believed that the rules applied in these cases form the basis of the modern law governing the warfare between organized labor and capital Since a strike involves the disturbance of relations between others10 it would seem that it is lawful only when it is justified1 The difficult problem is one of justification and this involves the weighing and balancing of the resulting benefit and injury to individuals and so ciety12 which is not a legal problem except in so far as it is made so by the doctrine of stare decisis There is general agreement among the cases that a strike to secure an increase in wages or obtain shorter hours or otherwise directly better the position of the employees with reference to the employer is justifiablel3 The benefit to the employees outweighs the injury to the there was combination the purpose of the defendants was to injure the plaintiff in his trade as distinguished from the intention of legitimately advancing their own interests Per Lord Shand in Quinn v Leathem 1901 A C 495 514 Gunter v Astor 1819 4 Moore 12 In this case the defendants clan destinely sent for the plaintiffs workmen and having caused them to be intoxicated induced them to sign an agreement to leave plaintiff and work for defendants Keane v Boycott 1795 2 H BI 511 Lumley v Gye 1853 2 El  Bl 216 Wilkins and

Law Rev 496 Tunstall v Steams Coal Co C C A 1911 192 Fed 808 It is submitted that when two or more employees agree to quit work in concert each employee is influencing the exercise of a privilege by each other employee and is thereby disturbing relations between each other employee and their common employer This is true whether the interfer ence is direct or through the agency of duly authorized labor leaders DeMinico v Craig 1911 207 Mass 593 94 N E 317 But even if a strike is not justified and is therefore illegal employees will not be en joined from quitting work although they may be liable to respond in dam ages if they do for the reason that such constraint would place the em ployees in a condition of involuntary servitude Arthur v Oakes C C A 1894 63 Fed 310 Injunctions in such cases are confined to restraining officers of a union or employees from inducing others to quit work or withhold their patronage or from otherwise interfering without justifica tion with the relations

is the result of agreement and not coercion14 The contested ground is reached when the strike operates to disturb existing or prospective relations between the employer and other per sons not parties to the strike Here the effect of the strike is to coerce rather than persuade the employer or other persons to exercise their privilege of ending or not establishing relations with each other Some courts while recognizing the privilege of disturbing by persuasion rela tions between others in furtherance of selfinterest deny the privilege of using coercion to accomplish this result Thus a strike to secure the closed shopl5 or to compel a boycott6 has been declared unlawful Other courts have taken the view that circumstances may justify the use of coercion so long as it does not assume the form of violence and have sanctioned strikes to obtain the closed shop17 Also it has been held that a strike to eliminate the danger incurred by working with incompetent fellow employees is justifiable although it may compel the employer to discharge other workers18 And it has been held that mem bers of one union may strike in order to obtain for themselves other work then being done by members of another union19 But a strike to compel the discharge of a foreman merely because he was disliked by the employees was declared unjustifiable20 Similarly inducing an employer to discharge a nonunion laborer merely because he would not join the union was condemned21 It would seem that if coercion is to be permitted at all much may be said in favor of the strike to compel a boycott where it appears that the purpose and effect is to substantially benefit laborers as a class and there is authority for this view22 However most courts have regarded It has been held however that if members of a union are coerced by the imposition of fines to join in a strike the interference is unlawful L D Willcutt  Sons Co v Driscoll 1908 200 Mass 110 85 N E 897 Also where an association by imposing fines coerced its members into withholding their patronage from another the means of interference was declared unfair and therefore actionable Boutwell v Marr 1899 71 Vt 1 42 Atl 607 Erdman v Mitchell

beyond the immediate parties who are at war and strikes to compel boycotts have generally been held unlawful23 although the same result may be accom plished by argument and persuasion24 A recent case in the Supreme Court of the United States Hitchman Coal  Coke Co v Mitchell et al 1917 38 Sup Ct 65 presented a novel state of facts The plaintiff was operating a coal mine under verbal agreements with its employees who were servants at will that only nonunion laborers should be employed and that the employees should not continue in the employ of the plaintiff if they joined a labor union The defendants representing a labor union were secretly per suading employees of the plaintiff to agree to join the union but to continue at work until a sufficient number had agreed to join the union to make possible a strike for the purpose of compelling the plaintiff to agree to employ only union labor The majority of the court three justices dissenting taking the view that the defendants were inducing a breach of contract held that an injunction should be granted There is much to be said against this conclusion of fact25 but if it be admit ted that for the employees to continue at work after agreeing to join the union was a breach of contract the part of the decree which en joined inducing a breach of contract was proper26 The decree how ever also restrained the defendants from persuading plaintiffs em ployees to terminate their employment and join the union which the employees were unquestionably privileged to do Since the relations between the plaintiff and its employees were being disturbed by mere persuasion the case is distinguishable from those cases condemning strikes to obtain the closed shop or the discharge of disliked employees or to compel a boycott all of which are cases where relations are being disturbed by coercion The case nearest in point is Tunstall v Stealns Coal Co27 where representatives of a labor union were enjoined from paying money to employees in order to induce them to quit work where it appeared that the object of defendants was not to secure members for the union but to inflict injury upon the plaintiff as a means of compelling an agreement with the union Paying money as an induce ment to others to exercise their privilege is not coercion and is lawful if the disturbance of the relations is otherwise justified28 It would seem therefore that the decision in Tunstall v Stearns Coal Co rests upon the ground that since the defendants object was not to obtain an immediate benefit by increasing the unions membership but primarily to inflict injury upon the plaintiff the disturbance of relations was not justified The decision in the principal case however seems to deny the privilege of the union to increase its membership and therefore increase its power for collective bargaining by soliciting and per suading plaintiffs workmen to terminate their employment in order to See cases cited in footnote 16

decisions which permit striking employees to induce by peaceful per suasion others to quit work or withhold their patronage from the em ployer29 In view of the tendency of courts generally to enlarge rather than restrict the scope of the workers privilege to disturb relations in order to promote their own welfare the decision was hardly to be expectedI 0 INJUNCTION TO PROTECT THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY IN NEWSIn a recent case Associated Press v International News Service C C A 1917 245 Fed 244 the complainant sought to restrain the defendant from appropriating news gathered at great cost by the complainant for the use of its members and selling and transmitting the same to the customers of the defendant The defendant as the court below found had thus appropriated the news by three methods first by employing and paying an employee of one of complainants members to furnish such news as received from the complainant before pub lication second by obtaining complainants news before publication from the New York American published by one of complainants members and thus inducing such member to violate the confidence under which it receives the complainants news third by taking com plainants news reports from the early editions of newspapers pub lished by complainants members or from their bulletin boards either transcribing them bodily or rewriting them without original investiga tion and without expense The district court1 had no hesitancy in en joining the first two practices and the soundness of its decree is sup ported by a long line of decisions both in this country and in England2 As to the third practice although the court found the facts substan tially as alleged it entertained a sufficient doubt as to the propriety of the decree sought considering that a new point was involved that it refused the injunction On appeal to the circuit court of appeals a further decree was entered enjoining the third practice Jones v Van Winkle Machine Works 1908

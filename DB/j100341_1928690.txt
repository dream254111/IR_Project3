A BERRIDGE I INTRODUCTION M ANY factors in the present economic situation make a thorough study of merchandise exports from the United States especially desirable at this time Some of these factors are i The great changes in both character and volume of our exports during and since the war 2 The present peculiar position of the United States with reference to the balance of trade and inter national finance and 3 The great need of the warridden nations for both goods and credit It is highly probable that our exports will change as to both character and volume in the months to come just as they have already changed since the signing of the armistice In order to recognize developments as they occur and to interpret their meaning it is neces sary to study current phenomena by the light of recent experience furthermore it is necessary to establish standards for judging monthtomonth and seasonal fluctuations In other words a background is needed before we can orient ourselves and hold our bearings in the present economic confusion Our object then is to present a general view of the export trade of the United States To attain that object it is necessary at some points to neglect the innumerable lesser articles of commerce and to base our analysis upon the most important individual commodi ties and groups of commodities We have found that a selection of one hundred of the most important export commodities contributes from 6o to 74 per cent a fairly large sample of the total value of exports The con clusions of this study particularly those concerning changes in the quantity of exports are based upon this sample of one hundred important commodities Other conclusions however are based on analysis of the statis tics of five great groups of commodities and of all ex ports of domestic merchandise The plan of the present investigation has necessarily been largely determined by the nature and grouping of the export statistics given in government publications Monthly statistics of the value of exports for five great groups of commodities as well as for all commodities have been published regularly since July I905 The groups just referred to are the following A Crude materials for use in manufacturing B Foodstuffs in crude condition and food animals C Foodstuffs partly or wholly manufactured D Manufactures for further use in manufacturing E Manufactures ready for consumption F Miscellaneous In this grouping exports are classified according to two criteria their purpose for manufacturing and food and degree of manufacture crude semicomplete and ready for consumption The grouping is not perfectly adapted to current needs for information concerning exports but it is much better than any classification previously in use for exports Accordingly the five great groups have been used extensively in this study A limitation of export statistics is that quantities are not given for all articles exported Values however are given uniformly The one hundred commodities which we have selected for study are all given in quan tities as well as values On the basis of the selected commodities we propose to estimate the relative physi cal volume of our exports for the years I9I5I9 The changes in the values of the great groups of mer chandise exports during the conditions of peace war I Practically all the figures used in this study were originally pub lished in the Monthly Summary of Foreign Commerce of the United States issued by the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce of the Department of Commerce formerly printed in almost cognate form under various other names and by other bureaus These monthly publications were used as the direct source for monthly figures giving exports by continents and by five great groups The same source was used for the exports of single commodities used in the calculations of their seasonal indices Annual figures are more conveniently available in the Statistical Abstract of the United States and in the Annual Report on the Foreign Commerce and Navigation of the United States both of which are prepared by the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Com merce In order to guard against misprints and temporary errors in reporting or totaling figures monthly items were obtained from the issue of the Summary appearing one year later as each number ordi narily contains figures not only for the current month but in revised form for the corresponding month in the year immediately preceding No figures for individual commodities or groups of commodities were used in this study prior to I9o0 For the classification now in use see Schedule B Classification of Commodities and Regulations Governing Statistical Returns of Exports of Domestic Commodities or any recent issue of the Annual Report on Foreign Commerce and Navigation of the United States Since that time changes in classification are not rela tively important A possible source of difficulty less serious for ex ports than for imports is the possibility of misdeclarations  a defect inherent of course in all figures of foreign trade and consequently unavoidable On the accuracy of reporting imports and exports see F R Rutter Statistics of Imports and Exports Amer Stat Asso Pubs March I9I6 pp I634 The total exports of the United States are divided into two classes  exports of domestic merchandise and exports of foreign merchandise The latter comprise exports from American ports of imported goods no valuegiving operation having been performed upon such goods within the United States except of course that of transportation Foreign exports amount to an insignifi cant fraction of the total exports of the United States ranging from one to two per cent since I905 consequently this study has been limited to exports of domestic merchandise Gold silver securities etc are not included 298 ANALYSIS OF THE MERCHANDISE EXPORTS FROM THE UNITED STATES 299 and armistice are described in the following section The changes in the geographic distribution of our ex ports are shown in Section IlI the method of construct ing indices of physical quantity of exports and the indices themselves are presented in Section IV Finally a study of the seasonal variations of fifteen selected articles and of each great group is made in Section V The findings are presented in three forms  graphic tabular and textual IL EXPORTS BY GREAT GROUPS The classification of exports is presented graphically in three ways  in monthly absolute values Chart i in annual ratios to a prewar base Chart 2 and in annual percentage distribution Chart 3 From the monthly figures of Chart i we are able to examine not only the longrun changes but also the equally impor tant features of seasonal variation and of the develop ments month by month The percentage distribution in Chart 3 refers all absolute values each year to the total exports for that year as a base showing the rela tive importance of the groups Chart 2 which covers the period I9I5I9 differs from Chart 3 in that the base of the percentages plotted instead of changing from year to year is fixed for each group That is the aver age value of each group in the four fiscal years I9III4 is used as the base for that group and ratios are com puted to that base for each year I9I5I9 This base period is long enough to assure us of stability yet does not reach so far back into the past as to impair its homogeneity and it carries us through the last full month of peace We shall consider in turn the prewar exports the wartime changes and the changes during the armistice PREwAR EXPORTS Considering absolute values three groups which show a definite upward trend are A D and E crude materials for use in manufacturing manufactures for further use in

mass of exports  Chart 3 discloses more clearly than Chart i that in the prewar period Groups A and E crude materials for use in manufacturing and manu factures ready for consumption were at first about equally important totaling altogether about 6o per cent of our exports but that the percentage of E manufac tures ready for consumption increased faster than that of A and D crude materials for use in manufacturing manufactures for further use in manufacturing the latter showing the slowest increase Group C tfood stuffs partly or wholly manufactured showed a some what slower decline than Group B foodstuffs in crude condition and food animals WARTIME CHANGES Taken together Charts i 2 and 3 present some very interesting facts concerning the influence of the war on the various groups At the outbreak of the war Groups A D and E all dropped Groups B and C rose Chart i After the first few months of the conflict however Groups B and C fell from their new level while Groups A B and E rose The most conspicuous and sustained increase was in Group E which climbed at a remarkable rate to a maximum of four times its monthly prewar level This group manufactures ready for consump tion contributed nearly half of our exports in the year July i9i6June 19I7 it steadily declined from then until the end of the war Groups D and B manufac tures for further use in manufacturing and foodstuffs in crude condition showed a similar action rising to a peak about 19I7 and declining in the last year of the war In absolute values Group A showed like Group E a steady rise throughout the war Thus the declara tion of war caused an immediate export of foodstuffs and a later but much more pronounced increase in the export of manufactures ready for consumption Chart 2 shows the ratio of the value of each group of exports for each fiscal year I9I 5I9 to the average value of the group in the four prewar years I9III4 in other words the rate of increase of each group with respect to itself From this it appears that in I9I5 Group B crude foodstuffs sprang most suddenly from its prewar level nearly quadrupling its I9III4 average The next striking development shown by Chart 2 was the sudden rise of Group E manufactures ready for con sumption to nearly 300 per cent in I9I6 Groups C and D also rose but to less than 200 per cent In 1917 Groups D and E continued a steep ascent to well over 300 and 400 per cent respectively Group A crude materials for use in manufacturing which had been moving below its 191I14 average rose to Ioo in I9I7 In I918 the order of the groups by their relative in crease over their respective prewar levels was Group C Foodstuffs partly or wholly manufactured  D Manufactures for further use in manu facturing E Manufactures ready for consumption Group B Foodstuffs in crude condition and food animals  A Crude materials for use in manufacturing Chart 3 shows that the percentage of Group A crude materials for use in manufacturing to the total fell in the fiscal years I9I5 I9I6 and I9I7 from 33 per cent to I2 per cent and rose in I9I8 to I5 per cent The peak in Group E manufactures ready for consumption in I9I6I7 corresponds so well with the deep depression in Group A as to suggest that much of the increase in the proportion of Group E seems to have been at the expense of Group A During the first year of war Group B foodstuffs in crude condition and food animals rose from 6 to nearly 20 per cent while the percentage of Group C foodstuffs partly or wholly manufactured increased from I2 to i6 per cent After I9I5 these UNIT  I000000

through I9I8 A more detailed examination of the precise articles causing these changes year by year discloses impor tant increases and decreases in millions of dollars re ferred to the fiscal year I9I4 omission of sign denotes an increase a minus sign  a decrease See Table p 30I CHANGES DURING THE ARMISTICE Chart I shows that since November I9I8 a pro nounced increase has taken place in three groups A crude materials for use in manufacturing E manufac tures ready for consumption and C foodstuffs partly or wholly manufactured In the case of Group A this might be regarded as a sign of approaching selfsupport by Europe because it would imply that industry there is getting back upon its feet The trend for this group throughout the war however was upward so that this slight acceleration is not necessarily a favorable sign Groups C and E foodstuffs partly or wholly manufac tured and manufactures ready for consumption how ever show in recent months some erratic changes Groups B and D foodstuffs in crude condition and manufactures for further use in manufacturing are at best neutral showing as yet no decided thrust either upward or downward Chart 2 shows that with reference to their respective prewar bases the groups have all increased in the fiscal year as a whole except Group D manufactures for further use in manufacturing Groups B and C food stuffs increased enormously in the fiscal year ending June 30 I919 while Groups E and A manufactures ready for consumption and crude materials for use in manufacturing increased much more mildly Chart 3 as may be expected shows great increases in the proportion of Groups B and C foodstuffs to the total exports in I919 Although we saw in Group E manufactures ready for consumption an increase in absolute value this was not sufficient to prevent its per centage of the whole from dropping in I9I9 although the absolute values of all groups are high Chart 3 shows decreases and increases which hint that the pro portionate shares are headed back to normal for all groups except C manufactured foodstuffs Clearer insight into the changes wrought by peace may be secured by comparing June I9I9 with June 19181 It is found that the chief changes were the fol lowing increases  and decreases  in millions of dollars In Group A Cotton unmanufactured 56 Tobacco leaf  I7 In Group B Breadstuffs unmanufactured 44 In Group C Breadstuffs manufactured   20 Meat and dairy products   96 Sugar and molasses    2 In Group D Copper in pigs ingots bars plates and sheets    I3 Bars or rods of steel    5 Billets ingots and blooms of steel    8 Tinplates etc    3 Leather and tanned skins   27 Oils mineral etc   2 In Group E Cars automobiles etc   26 Cotton manufactures of    9 Electric machinery    6 Explosives  9  Iron and steel manufactures   4I Leather manufactures of    6 Oils mineral refined    8 Such a comparison involving single months is of course not broad enough to give a view of the peace period as a whole On the other hand the annual figure for the fiscal year I919 is a composite of both peace and war months and therefore inferences based upon it concerning the purely peacetime trend are obscured A broader basis is obtained by comparing the seven months of peace JanuaryJuly I9I9 with the corres sponding period of I9I8 A comparison of the figures for these two periods although necessary is not suffi cient for the judgment of present tendencies We may judge the strictly peace tendency however by com paring the ratios which totals for the seven peace months bear to totals for the corresponding war months of I9I8 with similar ratios between the fiscal years I919 and I9I8 For example if some group in the fiscal year I919 exceeded its I9I8 value in the ratio I20 per cent but in the seven peace months exceeded the cor responding value for the seven war months in some large ratio as I50 per cent we might infer that the group must have surged upward more strongly in the peace months on the whole than in the last months of war If on the other hand the seven months ratios were less than 120 per cent say I05 per cent it would appear that though the rate of increase was still upward i e over i0o per cent the forces behind that group may be slackening in the peace months The figures which are given below strikingly show that the groups which show a weaker increase of values in the seven peace months than in the whole fiscal year I919 are Percentage of Percentage of value value fiscal year JanuaryJuly I9I9 to I9I9 to I9I8 JanuaryJuly I9I8i iDomestic Exports 1 21 132

EXPORTS BY DESTINATION The monthly values of exports to the two major con tinents is presented in Chart 4 the annual ratios to the prewar averages in Chart 5 and the annual distribution of exports by continents in Chart 6 PREwAR EXPORTS Europe and North America together received before the war about 85 per cent of our commodity exports Europe alone received over 6o per cent Chart 6 The proportion to Europe decreased during I905I4 while that to North America increased about as much The four minor continents totaled a nearly constant pro portion of about I 5 per cent For these reasons monthly data are presented only for Europe and America Chart 4 North Americas total though lower than that of Europe was clearly creeping upward in I905I4 from a level of about 25000ooo to about sooooooo a month Europes share of our exports rose less from about iooOOOooo to about I25000 ooo a month in the same time The pronounced sea sonal fluctuations in exports to Europe are due to the heavy

Iooooooo I a month late in I9I7 After reaching their respective maxima exports to Europe slumped in I9I7 and I9I8 and those to North America declined but slightly Chart 4 Chart 5 shows that Europes rate of increase with reference to its prewar base was exceeded only by Asia then come the other continents with South America high in the list From Chart 6 we see that in the first year of war Europe took more than 70 per cent of our exports but after the first shock the proportion dwindled gradually and at the end was about 8 per cent below that figure Chart 6 The proportion to Asia and to South America has increased steadily since I9I5 Africa and Oceania show the same relative standing as before the war in spite of considerable changes in the absolute values Europe received 63 per cent of the total exports from the United States in the fiscal year I9I4 During the years I9I5I9 the percentages ran as follows 7I 69 69 63 and 64 Europe is the major factor in the world trade of the United States the United Kingdom France Belgium and Italy are the major factors in our exports to Europe the United Kingdom being more im portant than the other countries combined The four allies received from the United States during I9I4I9 the following percentages of total European exports 6o 75 82 79 93 and 85 During the same period the exports to the United Kingdom ranged from 40 per cent to 53 per cent of the total exports to Europe The outstanding facts during the armistice are the slightly downward tendency in the monthly values of exports to North America to about ioo000ooo a month Chart 4 and the much more decisive upward tendency to Europe to the maximum of nearly 650 oooooo in June I919 Of these recent tendencies that of Europe is explained by the demands for foods and other finished goods on account of the economic and political demoralization there In Chart 5 the steep slope of the lines for I9I8I9 shows the great increase in the exports to all continents in I919 compared with the exports in I9I8 The rate of increase to Europe has recently been great enough to raise Europes percentage of the total in I9I9 Chart 6 We have now sketched the constitution of our exports as regards character and destination  A much more judicious use could have been made of the findings concerning the groups of exports by studying the com position by kind of the exports sent to each continent separately i e by continents and great groups simulta neously Unfortunately figures for this crossclassifica tion of domestic exports are available only through the fiscal year I9I7 Before the war Group E manufac tures ready for consumption held the dominant position in our exports to every continent except Europe rang ing from 50 per cent for North America to 75 per cent for Oceania Group A crude materials for use in manu facturing was preponderant in exports to Europe from I9II to I9I4 The war of course changed conditions enormously exports of crude materials to Europe dropped from 45 per cent in I914 to I2 or I3 per cent in I9I6 and I9I7 while the export of finished manu factures increased from I7 per cent in I9I4 to over 40 per cent in I9I6 and I9I7 The significant features of the export situation at the present time are then i A total value of exports treble the prewar level 2 An increase both absolute and relative to other groups in the exports of foodstuffs partly or wholly manufactured 3 A decrease since I9I7 relative to other groups in the export of manufactures ready for consumption and for further use in manufacturing 4 An increase in the total exports to Europe mainly the United Kingdom France Italy and Belgium since the signing of the armistice 5 Violent fluctuations in the recent monthly figures of all groups making generalizations concerning tendencies unsafe IV THE QUANTITY OF EXPORTS The preceding survey of our total merchandise ex ports is based upon values not quantities In normal times the case might rest at this point but not so now Prices have changed so greatly that a conclusion that the value of exports has increased does not carry with it a similar conclusion concerning quantities We know that general domestic prices wholesale and retail have greatly increased It is certain that export prices have also increased in lesser or  more probably  in greater degree due to the strong response of prices to international demand Let us now see if it is possible to determine the changes in quantity of exports which from some points of view is so much more important than values THE BASIS OF THE ESTIMATE In order to measure with great accuracy the physical quantity of all exports we should need to find the ratios of physical increase of each commodity exported That is impossible because quantities are not reported for all commodities If we should even attempt to cover the figures for every commodity given by quantity the labor involved would make the task practically impossible It is possible however to make a reliable estimate based upon a sample of sufficient size Consequently one hundred of the most important articles for which physical exports are given were chosen These articles are listed in Table 2 with the value and quantity of each exported in 19I9 and on the average in I9III4 This selection is inclusive enough to comprise about twothirds by value of all domestic exports Table I In order to increase that fraction we should have re quired a very much greater number of articles and by no possibility could we have reached much nearer IOO 1 The actual monthly maxima were

units for many exports and to the insignifi cance in the amount of others Table 3 gives the quantity of each of the one hundred selected articles exported relative to the average annual quantity exported during the prewar period I9III4 It is these individual relatives that constitute our material for estimating the relative quantity of all exports during the period I9I5I9 COMBINING THE RELATIVES We must somehow weld together these one hundred relatives into an intelligible index of exports in general and of the different classes of exports How shall this best be done  It would be clearly inaccurate to add the ratios and divide by one hundred for the commodi ties are not of equal importance in our exports This and various other forms of average including the weighted and unweighted median were after careful consideration rejected in favor of the weighted arithmetic mean Various methods of weighting were likewise studied Any weights that may be selected are not fully satisfactory for all purposes That one was adopted however which seemed most fairly to gauge the normal relative importance of the various commodi ties making up our exports in the open competitive international market of the comparatively stable period of peace I9III4 If the value of a selected commodity exported in I9III4 was 56oooooo a year and the total value of one hundred commodities for the same period was 8oooooooo a year the selected commodity would deserve a weight equal to 85060 or i70 instead of 100 to which its weight would naturally have been reduced if all IOO had been treated as equally impor tant The process then of multiplying each relative by its weight adding the products and dividing by the sum of the weights gives us a weighted index of the change of quantity in each year I9I5 to IgIg referred to the base period A question may be raised at this point as to the ad vantages of weighting according to a commoditys current importance with varying weights in our ex ports rather than its normal quota This question may be answered on three grounds i the heavy rates of increase of some commodities in war time have already been given a strong influence by our choice of the arithmetic mean which weights extreme increases heavily 2 it is recognized by statisticians that ap proximate accuracy only is necessary in weighting 3 our measurement virtually gives us the equivalent value of war exports at prewar prices and therefore automati cally credits an export with its due quantity increase as will be more fully shown whereas the other method of weighting would on the other hand virtually double weight the war commodities That our method of com bining our individual indices of physical increase may be regarded as a computation of the values of exports during the war at prewar prices thus canceling the bothersome price element and making possible a com parison of clear ratios of physical increase is demon strated as follows we computed the annual ratios of each physical quantity q to its I9III4 base qo and multiplied this by the ratio of prewar value vo of that export to the total prewar value Vo of the one hun dred exports Thus we obtained a series of fractions of this form q x V  That series may be thrown into the form  O  I V qoq J But  represents roughly the average prewar price qo of that commodity so that Lvo X q  represents ap qo proximately the value of the export in any war year as of the earilier price level1 Finally referring the sum to the common denominator VO eliminates price elements altogether and gives quantity indices that is in dices of the quantity of export of the one hundred articles Va I The ratio q would not give a reliable price per unit if monthly data were used because of the fluctuations in the grade of exported articles from month to month A year is a more reliable basis but the figures are of course subject to any biased errors in the export declarations An alteration in the articles reported under a given name would also introduce an error but so far as the printed data permit every precaution has been taken against that errorANALYSIS OF THE MERCHANDISE EXPORTS FROM THE UNITED

quantities exported bore to the average quantities exported in I9III4 ratios of II7 per cent I27 per cent I3 per cent II5 per cent and I3I per cent respectively The question arises did the great groups of merchan dise exports change in about those same degrees  If not how differently  Jndices were computed for each of the great groups by distributing the one hundred articles by groups and computing weighted group averages Properly balanced group lists were assured because the distribution among groups had been a consideration in the original choice of representative articles These group indices are given in Table 4 a Very considerable differences between the value rela tives and the quantity indices are evident from sections a and b of that table The indices of quantity for the

the period covered the articles included varied the same in quantity as those omitted But would that be the most logical hypothesis  The only data bearing upon this question are the values of goods included in the sample and in each group and the value of goods excluded Let us now see if we can make these indices of physical exports more reliable by making allowance for possible differences in the degree of physical increase in the excluded articles from that of those included Suppose that in I9I5 those of the one hundred articles the sample in a certain group had increased in quan tity to I20 per cent but in value to I 50 per cent of the I9III4 base But it is quite possible that the value increase for the entire group which we can of course compute directly differs from the value increase of the sample Suppose the relative value of the entire group is represented by i6o The discrepancy between the relative for the value of the sample I50 and the rela tive for the value of the group i6o may be due either first to a greater increase in the prices of the omitted articles than of those in the sample or second to a greater increase in the quantities of the omitted articlesANALYSIS OF THE MERCHANDISE EXPORTS FROM THE UNITED STATES 3II than those in the sample Since in fact we do not know which of these two is the cause of the discrepancy between the two relatives I5o and i6o we are forced to make an assumption that either one or the other is the more probable It appears more probable to assume that the price increase of the sample correctly represents the price increase of the group rather than that the quantity increase of the sample correctly represents the quantity increase of the group In other words we shall assume that using the illustration the relative of i6o for the group is greater than the relative of I50 for the sample because the quantity of the omitted articles increased more than the quantity of the sample Con sequently the indices computed from the sample will be adjusted according to the following formula Quantity relative for group x Quantity relative for sample Value relative for group Value relative for sample or using the illustration X I20 i6o I50 A6o X I20 X     I28 I50 It will be observed from Table i that Group E is not as fully represented as the other groups in proportion to their total value The selected articles of Group E include at the most 45 per cent of the value of the group compared with 64 per cent and upwards for the other groups  this in spite of the fact that it includes thirty two of the one hundred selected articles Let us con sider the reason and a possible remedy for this fact Manufactures ready for consumption are of course at a more complete stage of manufacture than any other group even foodstuffs partly or wholly manufactured This fact gives Group E a large number of very different sorts of merchandise  a difficulty not remediable by any ready addition of items because their kinds are so diverse that physical units for most are not available In fact of those for which quantities are given the great bulk are included in our thirtytwo and the addition of many lesser items could increase the inclusiveness but slightly Our assumption that for all commodities within any group the value increase is due more to its quantity increase than to its price increase needs to be examined then with reference to Group E to make sure that the unavoidable limitations to our choice of articles from that group do not seriously injure the conclusions from the selection An examination of the two major omis sions verifies our assumption specifically and shows that our selection from Group E is not only as complete as is practicable but presents changes similar to the neg lected items so that our selection even though com paratively small may be taken as fairly representative of war and peace commodities INDICES OF QUANTITY FOR ALL EXPORTS The indices of quantity for each group therefore have been computed on the basis of the one hundred selected articles and then these indices have been adjusted according to the method just explained The resulting adjusted indices of the quantity of all exports for the years 19I5I9 are respectively I22 I57 I71 I25 and I42 The indices for each group and for all exports are given in Table 4 e and

per cent of Group E in I9I6 and I5 per cent in I9I7 practically all the quantities given for brass ex ported are for  bars plates and sheets which belong to Group D and are included in our selection from that group The second was miscellaneous explosives comprising 6 per cent of Group E in I9I6 and 9 per cent in I917 our selection includes two explosives gun powder and dynamite It is possible to verify our assumptions insofar as they affect gunpowder prices by the War Industries Board price index for explosives Prices of Explosives War Industries Board Price Bulletin No 56 igig especially p 20 Prices of military and commercial explosives varied in i9i6 and I917 between II5 and i8o per cent of their standing in the year before the war this is not far different from our indices for Group E whereas the total values of exports in I9I6 and I9I7 stood at 7350 per cent and I2800 per cent of the I9I4 value Concerning the omitted articles made from brass no index is available but prices certainly went up to not more than a small fraction of the value increases which stood in I9i6 and IgI7 at 3500 and 6500 per cent of the I9I4 figure These facts appear to confirm our assumption that of the excluded commodities the value increase was far more due to increases in quantity than in price3I2 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STATISTICS Shipping Board These figures enable us to secure a test of the reliability of our estimate The estimate of the Shipping Board was made by converting the ex ports of each commodity into long tons and taking the totals for all commodities In case a given commodity were stated in value only a price per unit was assumed in order to get the tonnage The results of the Shipping Board estimate are that there were 52208250 long tons of exports for the fiscal year I9I4 and 62790329 long tons for the fiscal year I9I8 According to these figures the index of the physical quantity of exports in I9I8 compared with I9I4 is I20 Our corrected index re ferred to the I9III4 average as base is I22 when we make the change to the year I9I4 as a base it becomes I20 coinciding exactly with the result of the Shipping Board Such a close agreement with an independent and comprehensive measure of the physical volume of exports strongly substantiates the reliability of the method here employed Using the figures of the United States Shipping Board we are able in passing to present estimates of the quantity of exports in long tons for each of the years I9III9 The figures for the nine fiscal years I9III9 are given below in millions of long tons I9II 45 I9I5 6I

issued by the Division of Planning and Statistics United States Ship ping Board dated August 30 I9I9  If we include the physical volume of shipments to the American Expeditionary Forces we find the quantity index for I9I7 to be I72 instead of I7I for I9I8 I29 instead of I25 and for I9I9 I50 instead of I40 per cent The slump in quantity of exports is thus seen to be due only partly to the armys purchase and shipment in its own name of goods formerly shipped privately as  exports  it is more largely due to the heavy diversion of manpower from productive industry after our entry into the war and especially to the shortage of shipping 2 These figures are computed from the data given on p 45 of a report by the General Staff to the Secretary of War entitled The War with Germany a Statistical

the various con tinents change in these years  A complete answer to this question would require a special intensive research because the character of exports  i e the preponder ance of the great groups  is not the same in our exports to every continent Nevertheless a rough measure of the geographical distribution exports by quantity may be obtained by dividing the value of our exports to each continent by our general price indices for all exports This method reduction of values to quantities is not wholly reliable but yields the following rough indices by continents each referred to the 1911 14 average as a base The figures in Roman type repre sent the indices of value these quantity indices are represented in italics 19I5 I9I6 I9I7 I9I8 1919 140 214 310 267 329 Europe 1I39 175 1 90

ing in I9I7 a maximum percentage of I71 Chart 7 In I9I8 they fell almost to the I9I5 level but in I919 increased slightly in the fiscal year just ended the quantity was less than 50 per cent in excess of the I9II I4 average Among the groups C foodstuffs partly or wholly manufactured and B foodstuffs in crude condition now exceed their prewar levels more than do the other groups Group E manufactures ready for consumption ranks next then D manufactures for further use in manufacturing and A crude materials for use in manu facturing Chart 7 and Table 4 e Indices of values and of quantities of exports of domestic merchandise for each great group and the total are presented graphically in Chart 8 It is obvious that the ratios between the corresponding indices of value and quantity give indices of prices for the groups and for all exports Such ratios have been computed Table 4 c and presented graphicallyin Charts 9 and I0 Our indices of prices of domestic exports for the years I9I5I9 are respectively iOi I22 I63 2IO and 227 How do these compare with indices of prices computed for commodities in general Comparisons of our indices of export prices with Bradstreets indices and those of the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics all reduced to the base I9III4 are given in Chart 9 The movement of export prices is in general the same as that of domestic prices The former are however con sistently higher than the latter after 19I5 the excess reaching over io per cent in I9I8I9 This result is consistent with the theory that a heavy demand from abroad would have a greater effect upon the prices of exported commodities than upon commodities at large Indices of export prices for the five groups are presented graphically in Chart io Among the groups Group D manufactures for further use in manufacturing had on the whole in creased in price most of all until 1918 reaching a peak of nearly 240 per cent Prices in Group A crude mate rials for use in manufacturing have increased more in the later than in the earlier years 19I9 was its highest at over 240 per cent Group E manufactures ready for consumption increased very steadily though at a slower rate reaching in 1919 a value a shade less than 200 per cent much less than the relative increase of any other group At present the standing of the groups is A Crude materials for use in manufacturing B Foodstuffs in

to arrive at balanced judgments of current tendencies of exports the examination of seasonal variations If a selected November figure for instance is largely in excess of the preceding October figure that fact alone is not neces sarily a reason for remark because perhaps the series concerned normally shows such a relation Of course strictly uniform variation cannot be expected for in actual practice there is necessarily almost always some dispersion of individual events about the law describing their general course Nevertheless in the long run a guide of normal seasonality is useful in order properly to appraise current ups and downs and there are many indications that now nearly a year after the war sequences not so far different from the old ones are beginning to establish themselves Some features of seasonality have been pointed out incidentally in the discussion of Charts i and 4 Sea sonal variations in absolute values stood out promi nently before the war in some groups notably in Group A crude materials for use in manufacturing Groups B foodstuffs in crude condition and food animals and C foodstuffs partly or wholly manufactured show it less strikingly primarily because both are smaller in quantity so that either might be rather strongly seasonal in character without producing in their smaller scale curves conspicuous dents and bulges This diffi culty could be overcome partly by magnifying the arithmetic scale for these smaLler groups or by present ing them all for comparison on a logarithmic or  ratio chart Either of these plans and in fact

for the still weightier reason that they give only quali tative results without any definite criterion either as to the exact months of normally highest and lowest values or as to the exact variation in the intermediate degree of change The seasonality of exports both individual and grouped is of course due to a complex of causes among which perhaps the most influential are the seasonal variations of supply especially of agricultural products also the demand for certain commodities may rise and fall in relation to the seasons But these and all the other operative causes cannot work instantly as with all equal economic phenomena there may be a consider able lead or lag between correlated facts The raw commodities which are most directly and presumably most strongly affected would be expected to react more quickly and decisively to the round of the months whereas those requiring a higher degree of manufacture more transportation storage etc would be expected to lag in their production and export and therefore to show not only a later but also a less extreme seasonal variation The exact extent however to which these correlations and lags influence seasonality in the phys ical rate of flow of American exports has never been quantitatively analyzed It is one of the purposes of this study to analyze that feature because only in the light of such findings can an observer intelligently study current figures From the standpoint of this analysis the best solution yet devised is the Persons method with one important modification in the final adjustment This may be sum marized 1 as follows If the ratio for instance of the August to the July figure for any series as exports of bituminous coal is computed for a fairly long series of years as fifteen the resulting fifteen percentages will be distributed in various ways they may be centered about ioo per cent with an equal number above and below or it may happen that the bulk of them exceed ioo per cent in fact they may be bunched more or less densely about a quite different normal perhaps I20 per cent If this were so there would be a strong pre sumption that August tends in the long run to exceed July in about that ratio The ratio of September to August may be similarly computed for the same series of years and found to be grouped above some other per centage as go meaning that in the long run September tends to fall short of August in about that ratio Prob ably the best measure of normal seasonal variation in such cases is the median link relative i e that per centage which onehalf the percentages for a given month tend to exceed and the other half fail to reach This median may be computed for each of the twelve consecutive months and the whole referred to January as a base These last relatives are formed by com pounding the various  links  cumulatively and may therefore well be called the  chain relatives In order to eliminate the long run trend due to increase of popu lation price changes and other strong undercurrents it is necessary to isolate the seasonal element from the others This is done and the ratios then reduced to the average for the year as a base At this point one re finement is necessary Owing to the fact that not all months are of equal length and that the stream of exports and imports if uniform would tend to flow at a rate roughly proportional to the number of days in the month an index that corrects for that fact will reflect more truly the actual changes in the intensity of flow from month to month Therefore all figures have been adjusted for the lengths of months giving a true idea of how the real rate of outflow changes The better unit for use in tracing seasonality is that of physical quan tity nevertheless it is demonstrable that the use of values in computing seasonal indices is affected by changes in prices only to a small degree because one of the corrections already introduced into the computation has eliminated price and other long run influences thus our seasonal forces may be considered isolated This method has been applied to fifteen selected article to the five great groups and to the total domestic exports The results are presented in Chart ii and Table 5 Chart ii is based upon seasonal indices reduced to a fixed base i e the average for the year Table 5 gives the medians of the monthtomonth link relatives It is from these medians that the indices were computed These medians are presented because they are of value in judging current developments SEASONAL INDICES OF FIFTEEN COMMODITIES 2 Cotton unmanufactured shows a very strong seasonal variation attaining a maximum intensity of I82 per cent in December and falling from December until August when it attained a ratio of only 44 per cent of the annual average It falls very rapidly between these two months but rises still more rapidly between Aug ust and October Cotton constitutes threefourths of Group A and the seasonal movement in that group is primarily due to seasonality in cotton exports The heavy influence of cotton even on total domestic exports is also evident Leaf tobacco shows a strong contrast in seasonality with that of raw cotton It attains its maximum in July and August just the months in which cotton is at a minimum it falls from I69 per cent in August steadily to a minimum of 59 per cent in January it rises slightly relapses in May and rises rapidly between 70 per cent in May and I65 per cent in July Bitumninous coall shows a similarity in kind but in degree is very much less pronounced than leaf tobacco its maximum is reached in August at I28 per cent then falls off quite regularly to 7I per cent in January and advrances irregularly upward in the first two quarters of the normal year Wheat is curiously similar to leaf tobacco in some respects although it attains its critical values somewvhat 1 This method is more fully explained in the January REVIEW pp i83i especially p 27 and Table E p 3I 2 Refer to Chart iiANALYSIS OF

inclusive later in the year its maximum of I70 per cent is reached in October and two low points of 6o per cent in March and 44 per cent in June Wheat flour tends normally to hold quite closely to I20 per cent in September October November and December takes a pronounced drop between December and March to 88 per cent recovers slightly and again descends in July this time to 75 per cent of the average for the year Total meat products on the other hand reach their maximum two or three months later in December January and February at io8 per cent drop off gradu ally to a low level of roughly 96 per cent about which they tend to oscillate sporadically from April through November with very slight temporary recoveries in June and September The variation in this case is not marked enough to warrant us in concluding that there is a seasonal movement Total leather and tanned skins tend to rise very gradu ally from January to June arriving at I05 per cent in the latter month In July August and September this series tends to operate 6 to 9 per cent below the average for the year recovering in October to i io per cent and then falls to a temporary minimum of 96 per cent in January In other words this commodity tends to run in very moderate semiannual rather than in pro nounced annual cycles Sole leather tends to vary in a much more pronounced3I8 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STATISTICS

annual average in July August and Septem ber and alternates above and below par in the last quar ter Its minimum is reached in January at 84 per cent Billets ingots and blooms of steel show a greater sea sonal variation than might have been expected the first quarter tends to be high the peak is reached in March at I39 per cent The third quarter on the other hand tends to be low and after September it rises gradually at first and more rapidly after January Steel sheets and plates show a rough resemblance to billets ingots and blooms of steel except that these reach their maxima one to two months later  in April the latter reaches a value of I22 per cent is on the de cline throughout most of the second quarter and rises irregularly beginning in August to a maximum in November of I09 per cent of the annual average January is the low month at 83 per cent Total manufactures of iron and steel do not show seasonal variation Total wood and its manufactures and total paper and its manufactures do not show pronounced seasonal variations the former tends to be above the annual average in the six months MarchAugust inclusive attaining a maximum of I I6 per cent in April the other six months of the year are below par especially in October at go per cent The increase from October through January is extremely slight but somewhat more rapid than in the first quarter Minerals oils are slightly more seasonal Exports of this commodity are in general climbing between Feb ruary and September from 9I to io8 per cent being above par in the six months JuneNovember Agricultural implements as might be expected show a very strong seasonality The cycle is annual reaching its peak of I69 per cent in March descending rather rapidly to 77 per cent in July and August and falling again to a minimum of 53 per cent in November Throughout the winter and early spring it is on the rise The measurement of seasonal variation for groups of commodities is of less significance than for individual commodities The seasonality of Group A has already been noted As has been said it is due largely to cotton but it is greatly altered by the different type of season ality of other articles in the group such as coal and leaf tobacco Group B appears to have a seasonal move ment being lowest in the middle of the year and highest in the last four months Wheat and other cereals pre dominate there Group C shows the influence of varia tions in wheat flour Groups D and E do not appear to have seasonal variations Thus as we pass from the cruder groups to those at a higher stage of manufacture we find that in general seasonality is progressively reduced CAUTION CONCERNING USE OF INDICES Indices of seasonal variation are useful in interpreting current exports but one may apply them mechanically and thereby fall into error The following considera tions should be kept in mind when dealing with seasonal variation of exports First the medians of link relatives and the seasonal indices with a fixed base have two quite different purposes the indices give a measure of the purely seasonal ups and downs with all forces eliminated except the seasonality but the medians indicate the degree of normality of the actual current monthtomonth ratios Second one should not rely upon the seasonal indices as unerring mechanical predictors in each month as November a greater or less dispersion may be expected from the median link relative for November to October The dispersions in the past have been computed for each two consecutive months and a measure 1 taken of its degrees for each article and group studied This measure has been adjusted to take account of the fact that the actual dispersion is less serious for a strongly than for a mildly seasonal export2 This numerical coefficient of reliability has been roughly translated into words and shown for each article and group in Table 5 Third seasonality was interrupted in many cases practically obliterated in the past few years owing to the disturbance of trade by the war The effort is made here to derive measures of seasonal influence not with the idea that they can spring into immediate use with a high degree of reliability in all cases for they cannot The cessation of military hostilities does not alter the fact that economically speaking we are all still at war The economic aftermath of the war could not come to an end instantly but will doubtless lag on for many years Nevertheless some time presumably some time soon seasonal variations will gradually reappear sooner for some articles and groups later for others In other words the seasonal study should tell us more accurately than we could otherwise know what the past tells us to watch for Finally the seasonality of groups is sometimes due to the predominance of one or two articles within it Raw cotton for instance is so strongly seasonal and it constitutes so large a proportion of even the total of domestic exports that it sways the whole mass The groups really picture the resultant of the seasonality of the component articles The seasonal indices for groups are less useful than for the fifteen single articles but they perform the function of showing the fallacy of drawing from current changes in particular groups of merchandise exports the conclusion that our exports are altering fundamentally for many such changes are solely or predominantly due to the upward or down ward thrust of the seasons 1 The semiinterquartile range that is the percentage belt on either side of the median within which onehalf the actual link rela tives fall 2 Dividing the average semiinterquartile range for the year by the sum of the absolute deviations of the indices from ioo  a method not minutely but substantially accurate for the present purpose

HONOUR TO PRESENT TO THIS LEARNED SOCIETY ABOUT  TWO YEARS AGO I OFFERED MY THOUGHTS UPON SOME PLATES OF WHITE GLASS FOUND IN THE RUINS OF HERCULA NEUM I NOW BEG LEAVE TO ADD SOME MORE OBSERVA TIONS WITH A VIEW PARTLY TO EXPLAIN AND SUPPORT WHAT I THEN DELIVERED AND PARTLY TO COMMUNICATE SUCH NEW INFORMATIONS AS I HAVE SINCE RECEIVED RELATING TO THE SAME SUBJECT READ APRIL 9 1761 I OBSERVED  UPON

EXPERIMENTS TILL THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY BUT UPON RE VIEWING HIS DISSERTATION I FIND HE SINKS THE ANTIQUITY OF THAT USAGE A CENTURY LOWER THAN THIS THAT LEARNED WRITER ADDS FURTHER  THAT WITH REGARD TO THIS QUE  STION WHETHER THE ANTIENTS MADE THEIR ASTRONOMI  CAL OBSERVATIONS WITHOUT TELESCOPES THE AFFIRMATIVE  IS LOOKED UPON AS CERTAIN BECAUSE IF THIS INVEN  TION HAD EVER BEEN KNOWN BEFORE THERE IS ALL  IMAGINABLE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE UTILITY  WHICH WOULD RESULT FROM IT NOT ONLY IN ASTRO  NOMY BUT FOR SEVERAL OTHER PURPOSES WOULD HAVE  PREVENTED ITS BEING AFTERWARDS LOST MONS RE NAUDOT DECLINES ENTERING INTO THIS CONTROVERSY BUT OBSERVES THAT MABILLON MENTIONS A MANUSCRIPT HE SAW IN AN ABBEY IN THE DIOCESE OF FREISINGEN WHEREIN PTOLEMY WAS REPRESENTED OBSERVING THE STARS WITH A  TUBE LIKE OUR MODERN PERSPECTIVEGLASSES THIS MANUSCRIPT IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN WRITTEN IN THE BE GINNING OF THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY WHICH DATE SAYS MONS RENAUDOT IS THE MORE REMARKABLE BECAUSE PLAIN SPECTACLES WHICH SHOULD SEEM LIKELY IN THE NATURE OF THINGS TO HAVE BEEN INVENTED FIRST DO NOT APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN KNOWN TILL A HUNDRED YEARS AFTER THEN HAVING PRODUCED THE EVIDENCES WHICH PROVE THAT THIS LATTER DISCOVERY WAS MADE ABOUT THE TIME ABOVEMENTIONED HE CONCLUDES WITH SAYING  THAT  MABILLON DOES NOT MENTION THAT THE TUBE HAD GLASSES NEITHER INDEED WAS THAT CIRCUMSTANCE EASILY DISCOVERABLE PERHAPS SUCH TUBES WERE THEN USED ONLY TO PRESERVE AND DIRECT THE SIGHT OR TO RENDER IT MORE DISTINCT BY SINGLING OUT THE PARTICULAR OBJECT LOOKED AT AND SHUTTING OUT ALL THE RAYS REFLECTED FROM OTHERS WHOSE PRO XIMITY MIGHT HAVE RENDERED THE IMAGE LESS PRECISE  WE125  WE HAVE NOTHING OF THIS NATURE WITH REGARD TO TE  LESCOPES THE REASON OF MY ENLARGING UPON THIS ARTICLE IS A PASSAGE I HAVE LATELY MET IN THAT LEARNED ANTIQUARY MR ROWLAND WHICH MAY SEEM TO CONTRADICT THE OBSERVATION PRODUCED ABOVE THIS  AUTHOR ALLEGES THE AUTHORITY OF HECATAEUS APUD DIOD SIC TOM I P 159 ED WESSEL FOR SAYING THAT THE HYPERBOREI WHO INHABITED AN ISLAND IN THE NORTHERN OCEAN OP POSITE TO THE CELTAE  COULD AS IF THEY HAD THE USE  OF TELESCOPES SHOW THE MOON VERY NEAR THEM AND  DISCOVER THEREIN MOUNTAINS AND HEAPS OF ROCKS  WHICH THAT INSTRUMENT ONLY CAN DISCOVER THAT WE MAY DISTINGUISH HOW FAR HECATAEUS IS CONCERNED IN THIS PASSAGE IT WILL BE PROPER TO GIVE A LITERAL TRANSLATION OF IT FROM THE ORIGINAL VIZ  THEY SAY  FURTHER THAT THE MOON VIEWED FROM THIS ISLAND  APPEARS TO BE BUT AT A VERY LITTLE DISTANCE FROM THE  EARTH AND TO HAVE CERTAIN PROTUBERANCES LIKE LAND  VISIBLE ON HER SURFACE  NOW IT MAY BE OB SERVED IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT THIS PHAENOMENON IF REAL MAY PERHAPS BE EXPLAINED BY THE REFRACTION OF THE MOONS RAYS IN PASSING THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE EARTH WHICH IN AN ISLAND SITUATED VERY FAR NORTH MIGHT BE CONTINUALLY CHARGED WITH AN EXTRAOR DINARY QUANTITY OF VAPOURS OR FURTHER AS HECATAEUS MENTIONS IT UPON HEARSAY ONLY AND SUBJOINS SOME OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE SAME CHAPTER RELATING TO THIS ISLAND WHICH ARE ENTIRELY OF A FABULOUS CAST  MONA ANTIQUA P 76    WE126 WE MAY JUSTLY QUESTION THE  TRUTH OF THE FACT AND CONSEQUENTLY SHALL NOT BE OBLIGED TO MAINTAIN THE NECESSARY EXISTENCE OF TELESCOPES IN THOSE TIMES IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR IT AS IT APPEARS  THAT NEITHER THE LAPIS SPECULARIS NOR GLASS WAS USED FOR WINDOWS BEFORE SENECAS TIME AND IT CANNOT BE SUPPOSED THAT THE ROMANS A PEOPLE OF SO REFINED A TASTE IN OTHER INSTANCES WOULD SUFFER THEIR APARTMENTS TO BE EXPOSED TO THE FREE ENTRANCE OF WINDS C IT MAY BE REASONABLY ASKED WHAT SUPPLIED THE PLACE OF THOSE MATERIALS BEFORE TO SATISFY THIS ENQUIRY IT IS TO BE OBSERVED THAT SEVERAL OTHER MATERIALS ARE MENTIONED BY ANTIENT WRITERS AS SERVING THE PURPOSE BEFORE US SUCH AS THIN HIDES OR  SKINS LIKE OUR PARCHMENT MENTIONED BY PHILO PONUS PLINY LIKEWISE INFORMS US THAT THE HORNS OF THE URUS BEING CUT INTO THIN LAMINAE WERE  TRANS PARENT AND SUPPLIED IN SOME MEASURE THE USE OF OUR LANTHORNS AND WE MAY PROBABLY CONCLUDE FROM THE ANALOGY OF THINGS THAT THEY SERVED FOR WINDOW LIGHTS ALSO ESPECIALLY AS WE MEET WITH WINDOWS MADE OF HORN CORNEUM SPECULAR IN TERTULLIAN WHO WROTE

INTO THOSE APARTMENTS THIS OBSERVATION HAS BEEN SUP PORTED BY A LETTER I RECEIVED FROM MY LEARNED COR RESPONDENT ABBATE VENUTI AT ROME DATED DECEM BER 30 1759 WHEREIN HE INFORMS ME THAT HE HAD LATELY

NOT TAKE UPON HIMSELF TO ASCERTAIN THE REAL AGE OF THIS BUILDING I SHALL NOT PRETEND TO LAY ANY GREATER STRESS UPON THIS DISCOVERY THAN I DID UPON THE OBSERVATION FOR THE SAKE OF WHICH I PRODUCED IT FOR PROVING THE POINT I HAD THEN IN VIEW VIZ THAT THE USAGE OF GLASS FOR WINDOWS WAS PROBABLY NEARLY OF THE SAME ANTIQUITY WITH THAT OF ADORNING HOUSES WITH IT I INFORMED THE SOCIETY  THAT I HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO TRACE UP THE CONSTRUCTING OF WINDOWS WITH PLATES OF GLASS SUCH AS THESE FOUND AT HERCULANEUM HIGHER THAN TWO HUNDRED YEARS SHORT OF THE OVERTHROW OF THAT CITY BUT SOME TIME AFTER A PASSAGE IN BARONIUS WAS SUGGESTED TO ME WHICH SEEMED TO CARRY THE ANTIQUITY OF THIS PRACTICE MUCH HIGHER EVEN TO THE 42D YEAR OF THE CHRISTIAN AERA IT WAS A QUOTATION  FROM PHILO JUDAEUS WHEREIN HE

SEEMINGLY CONTRADICTORY READ INGS OF THIS PASSAGE MAY BE RECONCILED AS TO THEIR SENSE BY INTERPRETING PURAS LUCES IN THE ONE AND PUROS SOLES IN THE OTHER TO MEAN THE MILD LIGHT AND WARMTH OF THE SUN

THE SLOW PROGRESS THIS VERY COMMODIOUS INVENTION MADE IN TRAVELLING TO WARDS THE WEST SINCE IT APPEARS BY OUR HISTORIANS  THAT IT DID NOT REACH OUR ISLAND TILL THE SEVENTH CEN TURY WHEN IT WAS BROUGHT

OFFER RELATING TO THE SEVERAL USES OF PLATES OF GLASS ALREADY MEN TIONED IN MY ESSAY I BEG THE SOCIETYS INDULGENCE TO PERMIT ME TO SUBJOIN TWO OTHERS WHICH I HAVE MET WITH SINCE THAT COMMUNICATION THE FIRST OF THESE WAS SUGGESTED TO ME BY MY LATE WORTHY FRIEND SMART LETHIEULLIER ESQ WHO LAST WINTER AT BATH INFORMED ME THAT HE HAD IN HIS COLLECTION AN URN OF A QUADRANGULAR FIGURE WHICH  SIMON DUNELM HIST ANG SCRIPT P 92 STUBBS ACT PONT EBOR HIST ANG SCRIPT  STAVESLYS HIST OF CHURCHES P 103 HAD133 HAD BEEN DIVIDED INTO TWO EQUAL PARTS BY A PLATE OF GLASS THE VESTIGES OF WHICH WERE STILL REMAINING HE WAS OF OPINION THAT THE CELLS MADE BY THIS PAR TITION CONTAINED THE REMAINS OF SOME PAIR EMINENT EITHER FOR THEIR CONJUGAL AFFECTION OR SOME OF THE OTHER CONNECTIONS OF SOCIAL LIFE THIS CONJECTURE HIGHLY PROBABLE IN ITSELF IS FARTHER CONFIRMED BY SIMILAR EXAMPLES IN ANTIQUITY THUS WE FIND IN MONTFAUCON  THE FIGURE OF A SQUARE URN WHEREIN WERE CONTAINED THE ASHES OF A MAN AND HIS WIFE AS APPEARS BY THE INSCRIPTION UPON IT ANOTHER URN IS REPRESENTED PLATE LVII WHICH HELD THE ASHES OF A MOTHER AND HER DAUGHTER TO WHICH WE MAY ADD A THIRD PLATE LV COVERED WITH A SQUARE FLAT TABLET OF STONE ON WHICH WERE THREE INSCRIPTIONS SIGNIFYING THAT THE REMAINS OF THREE PERSONS WHOSE RELATION TO EACH OTHER IS NOT SPECIFIED WERE INCLOSED THEREIN THE OTHER INSTANCE WAS TRANSMITTED TO ME BY THE ABBATE VENUTI IN A LETTER FROM ROME DATED SEP TEMBER 27 1759 VIZ  THAT IN DIGGING UP SOME  RUINS IN THAT CITY A FEW YEARS AGO THERE WAS FOUND  AN ANTIENT PICTURE PAINTED ON MARBLE AND COVERED  WITH A PLATE OF WHITE GLASS LIKE THOSE USED IN OUR  TIMES FOR THAT PURPOSE ONLY SOMEWHAT THICKER  THE PICTURE EXPRESSED A LADYS HEAD AND WAS OF A  VERY ELEGANT COMPOSITION FROM THIS LAST CIR CUMSTANCE THE ABBATE INFERS  THAT IT COULD NOT BE THE PRODUCTION OF ANY LATER AGE MEANING I PRE SUME ANY PERIOD BETWEEN THE DECAY OF GOOD PAINT ING AMONG THE ANTIENTS AND THE REVIVAL OF IT AMONG  ANTIQ EXPLIQ VOL V P 1 PL 34 ED PAR THE134 THE MODERNS HE FURTHER ASSURES ME THAT HE SAW THIS PICTURE WHICH TOGETHER WITH ITS COVER WAS DE POSITED IN THE CABINET OF THE MARQUIS CAPPONI AT ROME THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF THIS PIECE BEING PAINTED ON MARBLE NATURALLY LEADS OUR THOUGHTS UP TO THE AGE OF THE FRAGMENTS OF GLASS WHICH OCCASIONED MY DIS SERTATION VIZ TO THE OVERTHROW OF HERCULANEUM OUT OF WHOSE RUINS FOUR PICTURES AMONG MANY OTHERS HAVE BEEN FOUND PAINTED ON THE SAME MATERIALS THERE IS A PASSAGE IN PLINY  WHICH HAS BEEN THOUGHT TO CARRY UP THIS MANNER OF PAINTING AS HIGH AS TO THE TIMES OF CLAUDIUS WHO BEGAN TO REIGN A C 41 BUT I AM HUMBLY OF OPINION THAT LAPI DEM PINGERE IN THIS PLACE DOES NOT MEAN PAINTING ON STONE OR MARBLE BUT ONLY THE STAINING THEM WITH ARTIFICIAL COLOURS AS THE REMAINING PART OF THE SEN TENCE RELATES TO THE INLAYING OF PIECES OF MARBLE OF VARIOUS TINTS WHERE THE ORIGINAL VEINS WERE DEFECTIVE EITHER IN VARIETY OR BEAUTY NOT THAT I THINK IT AT ALL IMPROBABLE AT THE SAME TIME THAT THIS SPECIES OF PAINTING MIGHT BE AS ANTIENT AS THE EPOCHA MENTIONED ABOVE VIZ THE REIGN OF CLAUDIUS BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY SUBSISTED IN THE TIME OF PLINY WHICH MUST REACH UP TO THAT AERA FOR THE FOUR

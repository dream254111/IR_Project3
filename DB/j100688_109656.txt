J100688,ABSTRACTS OF THE PAPERS PRINTED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,109656,ON THE INCONVERTIBILITY OF BARK INTO ALBURNUM ABSTRACT,I207043,290 ALSO UNITE WITH TLREE QUANTITIES OF OXALIC ACID BUT IT WAS FOUND THAT WHEN TWO PARTS OF POTASH ARE IN SOLUTION WITH SIX EQUIVALENT QUANTI TIES OF OXALIC ACID THEY DO NOT CRYSTALLIZE TOGETHER IN THIS PROPORTION BUT ONE PART OF THE POTASH BECOMES A TRUE BINOXALATE BY UNION WITH TWO PARTS OUT OF THE SIX OF OXALIC ACID TAKEN AND THE OTHER PART OF POTASH IS FOUND UNITED WITH THE REMAINING FOUR PARTS OF ACID THE AUTHOR EXPRESSES AN OPINION THAT WE SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO EX PLAIN SATISFACTORILY WHY THIS ACID REFUSES TO UNITE IN THE PROPORTION OF 3 TO 1 TILL WE CAN ATTAIN A JUST CONCEPTION OF THE GEOMETRICAL AR RANGEMENT OF THE ELEMENTARY PARTICLES IN ALL THE THREE DIMENSIONS OF SOLID EXTENSION IT BEING SUPPOSED FOR INSTANCE THAT THE PARTICLES ARE SPHERICAL WHICH IS THE SIMPLEST HYPOTHESIS IF THEY UNITE 1 TO 1 THERE IS BUT ONE MODE OF UNION IF 2 PARTICLES ARE UNITED TO 1 THE 2 PARTICLES WILL ARRANGE THEMSELVES AT OPPOSITE POLES OF THAT TO WHICH THEY ARE UNITED IF THERE BE 3 PARTICLES THE ONLY REGULAR POSITION IN WHICH THEY COULD REMAIN IS IN THE FORM OF A TRIANGLE IN A GREAT CIRCLE SURROUNDING THE SINGLE SPHERULE BUT FOR WANT OF SIMILAR MAT TER AT THE POLES OF THIS CIRCLE THE EQUILIBRIUM WOULD NOT BE STABLE BUT AGAIN IF THERE BE 4 TO 1 A STABLE EQUILIBRIUM WOULD OCCUR WHEN THEY ASSUME THE FORM OF A REGULAR TETRAHEDRON SURROUNDING THE SINGLE PARTICLE BUT AS THE AUTHOR DOES NOT PLACE MUCH RELIANCE ON THIS EXPLANATION SINCE SUCH A GEOMETRICAL ARRANGEMENT OF THE PRIMARY ELEMENTS IS ALTOGETHER CONJECTURAL HE IS DESIROUS THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE CONFOUNDED WITH THE RESULTS OF THE FACTS ABOVE RELATED WHICH ARE DISTINCT AND SATISFACTORY WITH RESPECT TO THE EXISTENCE OF THE LAW OF SIMPLE MUL TIPLES ON THE INCONVERTIBILITY OF BARK INTO ALBURNUM BY THOMAS ANDREW KNIGHT ESQ FRS IN A LETTER TO SIR JOSEPH BANKS KB PRS READ FEBRUARY 4 1808 PHIL TRANS 1808 P 103 MR KNIGHT HAVING ON A FORMER OCCASION OBSERVED THE BARK OF TREES TO ORIGINATE FROM A FLUID EXUDING FROM BOTH BARK AND ALBURNUXM CON TINUES THE SUBJECT BY OBSERVATIONS TENDING TO PROVE THAT BARK THUS FORMED ALWAYS REMAINS IN THE STATE OF BARK AND THAT NO PART OF IT IS EVER CONVERTED INTO ALBURNUM AS VARIOUS EMINENT NATURALISTS HAVE MAINTAINED EQUAL PORTIONS OF BARK FROM SEVERAL BRANCHES OF AN APPLE AND A CRABTREE WERE REMOVED BY CIRCULAR INCISIONS AND TRANSPOSED FROM TREE TO TREE IN THE SPRING AND A VITAL UNION WAS SECURED BY BANDAGES AND BY A PLASTER OF BEES WAX AND TURPENTINE WHEN SOME PIECES OF BARK WERE REMOVED IN THE AUTUMN OF THE SAME YEAR A LAYER OF ALBURNUM WAS FOUND TO HAVE BEEN FORMED BE NEATH THEM IN EVERY INSTANCE THAT OF THE CRABTREE HAVING THE COLOUR AND ROUGHNESS OF THE STOCK ON WHICH IT WAS PRODUCED WHILE THAT OF THE APPLETREE SHOWED NONE OF THE SINUOSITIES OF THE BARK OF THE CRAB TREE WHICH COVERED IT NEITHER DID THE VESSELS AND FIBRES OF THE NEWLY GENERATED ALBURNUM IN ANY DEGREE CORRESPOND WITH THOSE OF THE TRANS291 POSED BARK AND IT WAS EVI4ENT THAT IN EACH INSTANCE A NEW LAYER BOTH OF CORTEX AND OF ALBURNUM WAS GENERATED MR KNIGHTS ATTENTION WAS NEXT DIRECTED TO THE PROGRESSIVE FOR MATION OF ALBURNUM IN THE YOUNG SHOOTS OF AN OAK COPPICE BUT HE COULD DISCOVER NOTHING LIKE TRANSMUTATION OF BARK INTO ALBURNUM ALTHOUGH THE COMMENCEMENT OF ALBURNOUS LAYERS IN THIS TREE IS PECU LIARLY CONSPICUOUS BY A CIRCULAR ROW OF VERY LARGE TUBES THESE TUBES HE FOUND AT THEIR FIRST FORMATION PASSING THROUGH A SOFT GELA TINOUS SUBSTANCE MUCH LESS TENACIOUS THAN THE SURROUNDING PRE EXISTENT BARK AND THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE BARK AT ALL CORRESPOND ING TO THE CIRCULAR ROW OF TUBES CONTAINED IN THE ALBURNUM THE INTERIOR SURFACE OF THE BARK IS AT THE SAME TIME WELL DEFINED AND ITS OWN PECULIAR VESSELS ARE DISTINCTLY VISIBLE AND BY NO MEANS EXHIBIT ANY APPEARANCE OF PROGRESSIVE TRANSMUTATION MR KNIGHT REMARKS ALSO THAT THE QUALITIES OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF WOOD ARE NOT IN ANY DEGREE INDICATED BY THE BARK WHICH COVERS THEM HE INSTANCES THE WYCHELM AND THE ASH THE WOODS OF WHICH FOR AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS ARE FREQUENTLY SUBSTITUTED FOR EACH OTHER ALTHOUGH THE TEXTURES OF THEIR BARKS ARE EXTREMELY DISSIMILAR INAS MUCH AS ONE IS BRITTLE AND THE OTHER SO TOUGH AS FREQUENTLY TO BE USED FOR ROPES ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE VERY UNFAVOURABLE TO THE THEORY OF CONVER SION IS THE FIRM ADHESION WHICH SUBSISTS BETWEEN THE LAYERS OF BARK TO EACH OTHER IN COMPARISON TO THEIR ADHESION TO THEIR ALBURNUM TWO EXPERIMENTS OF DU HAMEL ARE HOWEVER CITED BY MIRBEL IN SUPPORT OF THAT THEORY IN THE FIRST PIECES OF SILVER WIRE INSERTED INTO THE BARK WERE FRE QUENTLY FOUND IN THE ALBURNUM BUT THE EVIDENCE IS DEFECTIVE AS IT WAS NOT RIGHTLY ASCERTAINED THAT THE PIECES OF WIRE DID NOT AT THEIR FIRST INSERTION PASS BETWEEN THE BARK AND ALBURNUM AND THUS BE LIABLE TO BE COVERED BY A NEW DEPOSITION OF EITHER ONE OR THE OTHER IN THE SECOND EXPERIMENT THE BUD OF A PEACHTREE WITH A PIECE OF BARK ATTACHED TO IT WAS INSERTED INTO A PLUMSTOCK  A LAYER OF WOOD WAS AFTERWARDS FOUND BENEATH THE INSERTED BARK PERFECTLY SI MILAR TO THE PEACH BUT IT IS EASIER TO CONCEIVE A LAYER OF ALBURNUM GENERATED BY DEPOSITION FROM FLUIDS THAT HAVE CIRCULATED THROUGH THE INSERTED BUD THAN THAT A PART OF ITS BARK SHOULD BE CONVERTED INTO A LAYER OF ALBURNUM MORE THAN TWICE AS THICK AS THE INSERTED BARK MR KNIGHT ALSO REMARKS THAT WHEN THE BUD IS DESTROYED THE BARK DEPOSITS NO ALBURNUM BUT BEING SMALL IT BECOMES ULTIMATELY CO VERED BY THE SUCCESSIVE ALBURNOUS LAYERS OF THE STOCK AND MAY BE FOUND MANY YEARS AFTERWARDS TO HAVE MADE NO PROGRESS TOWARDS CON VERSION INTO WOOD IR 2

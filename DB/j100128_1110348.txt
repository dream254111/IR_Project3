some of the minerals Rere again however unless the defendant has color of title to the minerals it is difficult to conceive how his possession can extend beyond that part which he has actually mined14 A striking similarity to the foregoing rules seldom directly recog nized in the authorities appears in the principles governing the acqui sition of rights by prescription The basis of the doctrine is that from such longcontinued use acquiesced in by the owner of the servient tenement the existence of a lost grant is presumed15 The user relied upon must be continuous and adverse and open18 for the owner of the servient tenement cannot be said to have acquiesced in a use which is not such as to have given him notice The difficulty chiefly arises in two situations In cases of intermittent user it is submitted that an application of the same rule that of notice which here would be implied from the frequency of the user will furnish the solution17 Thus the use of water during certain months of the year for irrigation may be sufficient to create the right18 as likewise a continued taking of ice during the winter monthsl1 A second and similar question is the determination of the extent of such a right It is commonly said that this is measured by the user in which it originated20 but the extent of the user is clearly no more than evidence of the terms of the fictional lost grant21 and the right can therefore extend only so far as it has been brought by the user to the notice of the presumed grantor whose acquiescence can only so far be implied Thus for instance where a dam has been built the right to flood the land of another is limited to that which has actually been flooded during the prescriptive period and does not extend to all land which the dam is capable of flooding22 It therefore appears that the same rule governs the acquisition of in corporeal rights by prescription as applies to the acquisition of cor poreal rights by adverse possession namely that the acts relied on to constitute prescription must be such as reasonably to warn the owner of the servient tenement of the character and extent of the use which is being made of his land28 DUTY OF LANDOWNERS TO TRESPASSING CHILDRENThe common law duty of an ownerl of land to a trespasser is to refrain from inflict ing upon him willful or wanton injury2 In order not to violate this French v Lansing N Y Supreme

674rule and yet to hold the proprietor answerable for injuries sustained by children attracted to and injured by something on the premises some courts have resorted to a legal fiction whereby the maintenance of the alluring thing is arbitrarily construed as an implied invitation to infants to enter and play3 though it may clearly appear that the presence of children would materially hinder the ordinary user of the dangerous contrivance and would hence seem most objectionable to the owner Again the act of the landowner in introducing or main taining the object unguarded though knowing or having reason to know that children may enter and be injured unless it be made safe is transformed by other courts into a willful and intentional wrong4 This construction which is clearly contrary to fact is evolved through a failure to distinguish between knowledge and intent5 and between deliberate wrong and negligence6 The confusion in some of the decisions is increased by the fact that the child seems to be regarded simultaneously as invitee and trespasser7 Still other tribunals have preferred to establish the landowners liability by application of the maxim sic utere tuo ut alienum non Icedas but they fail to point out what legal duty has been violated apparently confusing physical with legal injury It should furthermore be noted that the maxim seems to be properly applicable only to a user which produces injury outside the land on which it was made9 It has also been suggested that a proper principle on which to hold the landowner liable is that though there is substantially the same duty toward children and adults to keep the land near a highway safe yet child trespassers allured by some attraction should be allowed wider limits of devia tion than adults10 But the liability of the landowner in this instance is grounded solely on the policy of making the highway safe for travel1l and cannot legitimately be extended to cases where the child did not enter the premises from a highway or where the alluring thing was at a great distance from it even though the landowner might have reason to foresee the injury to children Though the liability of landowners to children in some of the jurisdictions which recognize it has been strictly limited to injuries caused by certain types of machinery2 yet on one theory or another it has been established in the majority of the United States In others however it has been altogether denied13 It is submitted however that the true doctrine is Chicago etc R R Co v Fox 9go6 38 Ind App 268 Keffe v Milwaukee  St

under the commonlaw duty first stated a landowner setting springguns4 and traps15 with intent to injure trespassers is liable as for willful injuries so it would seem that where he knows or ought to know from the character of the neighborhood and the inherent danger attractiveness and accessibility of something on his land that children will to a practical certainty trespass and be injured thereby his conduct in failing to take reasonable steps to guard against the injury is wanton and he should be answerable in damages1l An objection to the recognition of such a duty seems to be that the beneficial use of land is a necessity and that such use cannot be thus restricted without very substantial damage to the landowner17 since he will practically be made an insurer of infants trespassing on land which has alluring improvements18 This result does not seem fairly to follow from the rule since the liability of the landowner far from being absolute is dependent on the reasonableness of his conduct and the practical certainty of the injury The objection that the jury would be prejudiced in favor of the injured child19 does not seem to have more force than in other cases arising from negligence and as has frequently been done in applying the broader turntable doc trine if the verdict is contrary to the evidence on motion refused it may be set aside on appeal20 In the recent case of Nashville Lumber Co v Busbee Ark 1911 119 S W 301 where a child was killed in the lumber yard of the defendant by an unguarded moving chain the doctrine of the turn table cases was approved and it was held that conceding the infant to be a trespasser the question of the defendants negligence was nevertheless for the jury The refusal to find error in the action of the lower court in excluding evidence of a warning given by defendant to the childs parent prior to the accident does not seem justifiable even under the doctrine of the cases approved in the decision since it might have been important in determining the reasonableness of the defendants conduct and of course under the doctrine herein sub mitted it would properly have been admissible as affecting the ques tion of wantonness Bird v Holbrook 1828 4 Bing 628 Townsend v Wathen i808 9 East 277 Young v Harvey I86i I6 Ind 314 The defendant dug a well on his unfenced land near a common A trespassing horse fell into it and was killed The defendant was held liable since the probability of injury was so strong as to make it the duty of the owner of the lot as a mem ber of the community to guard that community from the damages to which the pit exposed its persons and property See Brown v Lynn 1858 31 Pa 5Io Blyth v Topham Cro Jac 158 9 Busch v Brainard N Y 1823 x Cow 78 It would seem that the idea of

Society by E Halley R S S SInce it was first found that the Torricellian Tube com monly called the Mercurial Barometer by the rising and falling of the Quicksilver therein doth presage the Changes of the Air in relation to fair and soul weather upon several years observation of itit has been proved and adjusted for that purpose by Dr Robert Hook and there have been by him many attempts to improve the Instru ment and render the Minute Divisions on the Scale there of more sensible He also judging that it might be of great use at Sea contrived several ways to make it ser viceable on board Ship one of which he explained to the R Society at their weekly meeting in Gresham Col ledge January 2 16678 since which time he hath further cultivated the Invention and some years ago produced before the said Society the Instrument I am now to de scribe which for its subtilty and usefulness seemeth to surpass all other performances of the like nature Till such time as the Authors present Indisposition will give him leave to bestow freely his thoughts on this subject upon the Publick it is the opinion of the Society that such an account be given of this Contri vance as may render it known and recommend it to the Mariners use for which it was principally intended The Mercurial Barometer requiring a perpendicular posture and the Quicksilver vibrating therein with great violence upon any Agitation is therefore uncapable of being788 being used at Sea though it hath lately been contrived to be made portable So it remained to find out some o ther principle wherein the position of the Instrument was not so indispensably necessary For this all those that use the Sea are obliged to the great facility Dr Hook has always shewn in applying Philosophical Experiments to their proper uses It is about 40 years sincethat the Thermometers of Robt de Fluctibus depending on the dilatation and contraction of included Air by Heat and Cold have been disused upon discovery that the Airs pressure is unequal that inequality mixing it self with the effects of the warmth of the Air in that Instrument And instead thereof was substituted the Seald Thermometer including Spirit of Wine first brought into England out of Italy by Sir Robert Southwell as a proper Standard of the temper of the Air in relation to Heat and Cold that aetherial Spirit being of all the known liquors the most susceptible of dilatation and contraction especially with a moderate de gree of either Heat or Cold Now this being allowed as a Standard and the other Thermometer that includes Air being graduated with the same divisionsso as at the time when the Air was included to agree with the Spirit Thermometer in all the degrees of Heat and Cold noting at the same time the precise height of the Mercury in the common Barometers It will readily be understood that whensoever these two Thermometers shall agree the pressure of the Air is the same it was when the Air was included and the Instrument graduated That if in the AirThermometer the liquor stand higher than the division marked thereon corresponding with that on the Spirit Glass it is an indication that there is a greater pressure of the Air at that time than when the Instrument was graduated And the contrary is to be concluded when the Airglass stands lower than the Spirit viz that then the Air is so much lighter and the Quicksilver in the or785 ordinary Barometers lower than at the said time of Gra duation And the spaces answering to an inch of Mercury will be more or less according to the quantity of Air so in cluded and the smallness of the Glass Cane in which the liquor rises and falls and may be augmented almost in any proportion under that of the specifick gravity of the Liquor of the Thermometer to Mercury So as to have a foot or more for an inch of Mercury which is another great convenience It has been observed by some that in long keeping this Instrument the Air included either finds a means to escape or deposits some vapours mixt with it or else for some other cause becomes less Elastick whereby in process of time it gives the height of the Mercury some what greater than it ought but this if it should hap pen in some of them hinders not the usefulness thereof for that it may at any time very easily be corrected by experiment and the rising and falling thereof are the things chiefly remarkable in it the just height being barely a curiosity In these parts of the World long experience has told us that the rising of the Mercury forebodes fair weather after foul and an Easterly or Northerly wind and that the falling thereof on the contrary signifies Southerly or Westerly winds with Rain or stormy Winds or both which latter it is of much more consequence to provide against at Sea than at Land and in a stormthe Mercury beginning to rise is a sure sign that it begins to abate as has been experienced in high Latitudes both to the Nor wards and Southwards of the Equator The Form of this Instrument is shown in the Cut by Fig 8 wherein A B represents the SpiritThermometer graduated from o or the freezing point through all the possible de grees of the heat or cold of the Air at least in these Cli mates C D794 CD is the AirThermometer graduated after the same manner with the like degrees E F is a Plate applyed to the side of the Thermometer C D graduated into spaces answering to inches and parts of an inch of Mercury in the Common Barometers G a Hand standing on the Plate at the height of the Mercury thereon as it was when the Instrument was graduated as suppose here at 29 12 inches L M a Wire on which the Plate EF slips up and down parallel to the Cane of the Thermometer C D K any point at which the Spirit stands at the time of observation suppose at 38 on the SpiritThermometer Slide the Plate E F till the Hand G stand at 38 on the AirThermometer and if the Liquor therein stand at 38 likewise then is the pressure of the Air the same as at the time of Graduation viz 29 5 but if it stand higheras at 30 at Ithen is the pressure of the Air greater and the division on the sliding Plate against the Liquor shews the present height of the Mercury to be 29 inches 7 tenths And this may suffice as to the manner of using it I had one of these Barometers with me in my late Southern Voyage and it never failed to prognostick and give early notice of all the bad weather we had so that I depended thereon and made provision accordingly and from my own experience I conclude that a more use ful contrivance hath not for this long time been offered for the benefit of Navigation These Instruments are made according to the di rection of Dr Hook by Mr Henry Hunt Operator to the Royal Society who will furnish any Gentleman with them and give them directions how to use them

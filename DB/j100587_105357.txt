SAID 200 HOUSES WERE BLOWN DOWN AND MANY PEOPLE KILLED IN EVERY COUNTY IN MARYLAND MUCH DAM AGE WAS DONE BY THIS GUST WHICH WAS THE MOST GENERAL EVER REMEMBERED IT WAS ALL OVER NEW YORK THE JERSEYS PENSYLVANIA MARYLAND AND VIRGINIA AND DID MUCH DAMAGE EVERY WHERE HOW MUCH FARTHER IT EXTENDED EITHER NORTHWARD OR SOUTHWARD I HAVE NOT HEARD IN THESE TWO LAST MONTHS AN EPI DEMICAL SPOTTED FEVER WAS COMMON IN THE COUNTRY I HAVE NOT HEARD IT WAS MORTAL ANY WHERE THOSE WHO HAD IT MOST SEVERE WERE RELIEVED WITH WHAT MR COLLINSON CALLS APOCINON THERE RAGED AT THE SAME TIME AN EPIDEMICAL DISEASE AMONGST THE DOGS WHICH DE STROYED GREAT NUMBERS IN ALL THE NORTH ERN PLANTATIONS IT CAME FROM THENCE TO THE EASTERN SHORE IN MARYLAND WHERE IT KILLED MOST OF THE DOGS IT NOW RAGES AMONGST OUR DOGS AND SCARCE ANY RECOVER THEY ARE FIRST SEIZED WITH A SHORT COUGH AND A STOPPAGE IN THE NOSE SO THAT THEY ARE OBLIGED TO BREATHE THRO THE MOUTH IN FOUR V O L LI L FIVE74 MERCURY HIGHEST LOWEST FIVE OR SIX DAYS AFTER THEY HAVE A LARGE DISCHARGE THRO THE NOSTRILS OF A THICK FETID MATTER AND A PLENTIFUL SEROUS DIS CHARGE FROM THEIR EYES NOW THEIR STOMACH FAILS OR RATHER THEY ARE AFRAID TO EAT FOR EVERY ATTEMPT MAKES THEM COUGH VIOLENTLY AND SEEMS TO GIVE THEM GREAT PAIN SOME DIE WITHIN TWO DAYS AFTER THIS DISCHARGE SOME LIVE A WEEK OR LONGER THESE HAVE HAD FOOD FORCED INTO THEIR STOMACHS BUT NONE EVER RECOVER THAT I HAVE HEARD OF JULY 93 69 SEASONABLE WEATHER AND THE MOST PLEN TIFUL APPEARANCE OF CORN AND TOBACCO I EVER SAW THE WHEAT WAS GOT IN LAST MONTH IT IS SUPPOSED THERE WILL BE THE MOST OF ANY YEAR SINCE THE SETTLE MENT OF THIS COUNTRY AUG 93 68 VERY DRY THE DISEASE AMONGST DOGS CONTINUES THO LESS VIOLENT MANY HAVE THEIR LIMBS SEIZED WITH A PARALY SIS THESE ALL RECOVER SEPT 92 60 THE DISEASE CONTINUES AMONGST THE DOGS THIS MONTH I SAW A TAME FOX VERY ILL WITH THIS DISORDER I GAVE HIM A DOSE OF A VALUABLE POWDER WITH WHICH I HAVE DONE MUCH GOOD AND FOR THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHICH I WAS OBLIGED TO MY WORTHY FRIEND DR PARSONS WHEN I WAS LAST IN ENGLAND I HAVE KNOWN THIS POWDER CURE DOGS WHICH MADE ME GIVE IT TO THIS FOX BUT HE DIED IN THREE75 MERCURY HIGHEST LOWEST THREE MINUTES AFTER WHICH I ATTRIBUTE TO THE PUNCH IN WHICH I GAVE IT THIS IS THE HOTTEST AND DRIEST SUMMER EVER KNOWN IN MARYLAND THERE ARE GREAT CROPS OF CORN AND TOBACCO MADE BUT THROUGH THE EXTREME DRYNESS OF THE WEATHER THE LATTER CROPS OF NEITHER WILL COME TO PERFECTION MANY SPRINGS ARE DRIED UP THAT WERE EVER CURRENT BEFORE PUTRID BILIOUS FEVERS ARE NOW VERY FREQUENT IN THE COUNTRY AND HAVE RAGED FOR THESE SIX WEEKS PAST SO LIKEWISE HAS AN HEPATIC DYSENTERY WHICH I HAVE BEEN INFORMED FOR IT HAS NOT COME WITHIN MY OWN PRAC TICE HAS OFTENTIMES BEEN SO MALIGNANT AS NOT TO YIELD TO ANY MEDICINES THAT COULD BE THOUGHT OF OCT 90 29 THE WEATHER SEASONABLE THE DYSENTE RIES THAT HAVE BEEN SO FATAL IN MANY PARTS OF THE PROVINCE HAVE REACHED MY NEIGHBOURHOOD THE BILIOUS FE VER NOW IS AND FOR SOME TIME PAST HAS BEEN VERY COMMON IN THIS COUN TRY AS THE PATIENTS UNDER MY CARE HAD FREQUENT LARGE BILIOUS STOOLS AFTER THE STIMULUS ON THE INTESTINES WAS REMOVED BY OPIATES AND THEY VOIDED NO BLOOD IMAGINING THE FEVER AND THE FLUX OWING TO THE SAME CAUSE ONLY AFFECTING DIFFERENT PARTS I GAVE DR PARSONSS POWDERS WHICH I ALWAYS USED WITH SUCCESS AND MY PATIENTS L 2 GOT76 MERCURY HIGHEST LOWEST GOT WELL THE METHOD I FOUND SUC CESSFUL AFTER TRYING MANY OTHERS WAS TO GIVE OPIATES AT PROPER INTERVALS TILL THE PURGING AND BLOODY STOOLS CEASED THEN FOUR OR FIVE DOSES OF DR PARSONSS POWDERS AFTERWARDS A FEW DOSES OF ASTRINGENTS WHICH NEVER FAILED OF CUR ING THE OPIATE I USED WAS PIL MAT THAEI WHICH I SUPPOSED BEST IN THIS PUTRID BILIOUS COMPLAINT BECAUSE OF THE SOAP IN ITS COMPOSITION IT IS RE MARKABLE THAT THE FREQUENT REPETITION OF THE STRONGEST ASTRINGENTS NEVER DE CREASED THE QUANTITY OR NUMBER OF THE STOOLS TILL DR PARSONSS POWDERS WERE GIVEN THESE VALUABLE POWDERS WHICH THAT INGENIOUS AND BENEVOLENT GENTLE MAN COMMUNICATED TO ME WHEN I WAS AT LONDON HAVE BEEN OF INCRE DIBLE SERVICE IN THE PLANTATIONS I AM PERSUADED HE WILL READILY INFORM ANY PRACTITIONER WHAT THEY ARE AND THAT NOTHING IS WANTING TO BRING THEM INTO GENERAL USE IN ALL BILIOUS AND PUTRID FEVERS BUT A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR EXTRAORDINARY EFFICACY NOV 73 27 THE HEPATIC FLUX SPREADS VERY MUCH IN MY NEIGHBOURHOOD ON THE 22D I WAS CALLED TO A FAMILY WHERE THE MISTRESS AND MAID WERE BOTH DOWN WITH THIS DISORDER AND APPEARED TO HAVE IT VERY MUCH ALIKE THEY WERE MUCH GRIPED AND PURGED MORE THAN 5 2077 MERCURY HIGHEST LOWEST 20 TIMES IN 24 HOURS SOMETIMES BLOOD IN A LARGE PROPORTION WAS MIXED WITH THEIR STOOLS BUT THE MOST TROU BLESOME SYMPTOM WAS A VIOLENT TENES MUS THE MISTRESS TOOK TWO DOSES OF DR PARSONSS POWDER AND THE MAID AS MANY OF DR JAMESS AT NIGHT THE MISTRESS TOOK AN ANODYNE DRAUGHT AND THE MAID GR 8 PILULAE MATTHAEI THE NEXT DAY THEY TOOK SOME ASTRINGENT POWDERS AT NIGHT THEIR ANODYNE AND THE DAY FOLLOWING BOTH WERE WELL THE SMALLPOX AND SWINEPOX ARE NOW ABOUT THE COUNTRY DEC 63 13 PEOPLE IN GENERAL VERY HEALTHY THE SMALLPOX SPREADS BUT SLOWLY AND IS VERY FAVOURABLE 1757 JAN 65 10 MANY SUDDEN ALTERATIONS AS TO HEAT AND COLD HAVE BEEN IN THIS MONTH BUT THE MOST REMARKABLE I HAVE EVER OB SERVED WAS THE LAST DAY OF THIS MONTH WHEN THE  WAS UP AT 65 AND THE NEXT DAY FEB 1 WHEN IT WAS DOWN AT 28 ABOUT THE SAME HOUR IN THE DAY THE PEOPLE OF MARYLAND WERE AF FLICTED LAST YEAR WITH SCARCE ANY COM PLAINTS WHICH WERE NOT ATTENDED MORE OR LESS WITH BILIOUS SYMPTOMS AND AS THE YEAR ADVANCED THE WEATHER BEING UNUSUALLY HOT SUCH SYMPTOMS GREW MORE78 MORE VIOLENT AND THE BILE MORE PU TRESCENT A BARE STATE OF THE MANY ODD CASES THAT CAME UNDER MY CARE WOULD FILL SEVERAL SHEETS OF PAPER BUT AS MY OWN WAS VERY PARTICULAR I SHALL ONLY MENTION THAT I WAS TAKEN ON THE 24TH DEC LAST WITH A SLIGHT FEVER AND SORE THROAT WHICH CONTINUED THREE DAYS THEN THE FEVER AND SORE THROAT LEFT ME BUT FOR THREE NIGHTS AFTER WARDS I FELT MORE UNEASINESS THAN I EVER BEFORE WAS SENSIBLE OF THO QUITE FREE FROM PAIN OR FEVER I WAKED I SUPPOSE AT LEAST AN HUNDRED TIMES EACH OF THESE NIGHTS IF I TRIED TO LIE ON EITHER SIDE I ALWAYS TURNED IN SENSIBLY ON MY BACK WHEN ASLEEP MY IMAGINATION WAS FILLED WITH THE MOST FRIGHTFUL IDEAS THAT EVER DISTURB ED AN HUMAN MIND BUT I COULD RE MEMBER NONE OF THEM WHEN I AWOKE I CONSTANTLY LOST MY BREATH WHEN ASLEEP AND WAS WAKED BY AN HIDEOUS WHOOPING NOISE LIKE THAT OF A CHILD IN A CHINCOUGH I PRESENTLY FELL ASLEEP AGAIN AND THE SAME HORRID SCENE WAS REACTED THE SEVENTH NIGHT FROM MY FIRST ATTACK WAS ATTENDED WITH A NEW TRAIN OF SYMPTOMS ABOUT THREE O CLOCK IN THE MORNING I WAS AFFLICTED WITH A MOST EXCRUCIATING PAIN ABOUT THE FIFTH OR SIXTH VERTEBRA OF THE BACK LIKE THE BORING OF AN AUGRE I WAS FORCED TO QUIT THE BED AND TO MY GREAT79 MERCURY HIGHEST LOWEST GREAT SURPRIZE WAS EASY ALMOST AS SOON AS I GOT ON MY CLOATHS BUT IT RETURN ED AS SOON AS I ATTEMPTED TO LIE DOWN AGAIN THIS LASTED 27 DAYS EVER FREE FROM PAIN WHILE UP AND ALWAYS TAKEN ABOUT SEVEN HOURS AFTER LYING DOWN EITHER BY NIGHT OR DAY NEITHER THE INDIAN BATH BLISTERS OR ANY THING I COULD THINK OF DID RELIEVE ME BUT GETTING UP ALWAYS EASED ME IT WAS PLAINLY A SPASM OF THE MUSCLE TRAPI ZEUS FOR IF I RUBBED MY BACK EVER SO SLIGHTLY THE PAIN WOULD INSTANTLY REMOVE TO THE MUSCLES OF THE STERNUM ET VICE VERSA YET I COULD NEVER FEEL IT IN MY SIDE WHETHER IT WAS LEAVING ME OR NOT I CANNOT SAY BUT I SEEM ED TO FIND GREAT RELIEF BY DRINKING PUNCH INTO WHICH GOA STONE HAD BEEN PLENTIFULLY GRATED IT IS VERY STRANGE THAT DURING THE WHOLE TIME I HAD NO FEVER OR LOST MY APPETITE THO I GREW VERY WEAK FEB 67 8 IT RAINED ALMOST EVERY DAY THIS MONTH AND AT THIS TIME THERE PREVAILED A DIS ORDER AMONG THE NEGROES WHICH I BELIEVE WAS PECULIAR TO THEM FOR I NEVER HEARD OF ANY WHITE PERSONS HAVING IT THEY WERE TAKEN WITH PAINS IN THEIR HEADS NECKS SHOULDERS BREASTS OR BELLIES IT SELDOM CONTI NUED LONG IN A PLACE TILL IT GOT TO THE THIGH WHERE THE COMPLAINT WOULD FORM80 MERCURY HIGHEST LOWEST FORM INTO A VERY HARD AND SENSIBLE TU MOUR GENERALLY IN THE TRICEPS MUSCLE EMOLLIENT PLAISTERS WOULD COMMONLY REMOVE THE TUMOUR IN TWO DAYS TIME THE MORBIFIC MATTER WOULD GIVE EX QUISITE PAIN IN ITS DESCENT DOWN THE THIGH AND WOULD COLLECT AGAIN INTO A TUMOUR EITHER IN THE HAM OR IN THE CALF OF THE LEG THE SAME CATAPLASMS CONTINUED WOULD REPEL THE TUMOUR AND THE PATIENT WOULD GET WELL USUALLY IN ABOUT A FORTNIGHT THERE WAS AN HIGH FEVER DURING THE TIME I NEVER KNEW BUT ONE SUPPURATE THO I HAVE SEEN MANY IN THIS COMPLAINT THIS HAP PENED TO A NEGRO BOY ABOUT 15 YEARS OLD HERE THE MATTER DESCENDED TO THE FOOT WHICH WAS VERY TROUBLESOME TO HEAL MAR 65 30 A VAST DEAL OF RAIN FELL THIS MONTH APR 67 35 THE WETTEST AND COLDEST APRIL WITHIN MANS MEMORY IMPETIGENOUS DIS ORDERS VERY COMMON BOTH IN MARY LAND AND VIRGINIA AND SOME VERY OB STINATE MAY 88 48 SEASONABLE AND HEALTHY JUNE 90 72 AN UNCOMMON WET MONTH THE HARD RAINS BEAT OFF THE FLOUR OR FARINA FECUNDANS OF THE WHEAT SO THAT VERY LITTLE OF THAT GRAIN WAS MADE THIS YEAR JULY 90 64 MUCH RAIN IT IS VERY REMARKABLE THAT MANY PEOPLE THIS MONTH AND THE LAST IN81 MERCURY HIGHEST LOWEST IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY WERE TROUBLED WITH IMPOSTHUMATIONS UNDER THE ARM ALL IN THE AXILLA DEXTRA THEY MATURATED AND HEALED UP PRETTY EASILY WHETHER THIS HAS ANY AFFINITY TO THE DISPOSITION OF THE PRESENT AND PRECEDING YEAR I CANNOT SAY I BEFORE OBSERVED THAT ALMOST EVERY PATIENT IN WHATEVER DISORDER HAD MORE OR LESS OF BILIOUS SYMPTOMS I HAVE SEEN MORE INFLAM MATIONS OF THE NECK OF THE BLADDER THIS MONTH THAN ALL MY LIFE BEFORE THEY WERE CURED BY ANTIPHLOGISTIC MEDICINES AUG 90 67 MUCH RAIN AND THICK FOGGY WEATHER SEPT 88 47 VERY WET WITHIN THESE TWO MONTHS I HAVE SEEN FIVE PERSONS AND HAVE HEARD OF MANY MORE WHO WERE TAKEN WITH A VIOLENT PAIN IN THE OS FRONITS ON THE LEFT SIDE THE PAIN SOON FELL INTO THE EYE ON THE SAME SIDE AND OCCASIONED A DIMNESS BUT THIS AND THE PAIN WERE SOON REMOVED BY AN EPISPASTIC BEHIND THE EAR IF APPLIED EARLY I WAS CALLED TO A NEGRO WENCH WHO HAD HAD THE COMPLAINT SO LONG THAT SHE WAS TOTALLY BLIND OF BOTH EYES WHICH APPEARED AS IN THE GUTTA SERENA WITHOUT ANY INFLAMMATION OR VISIBLE DEFECT BUT EXTREMELY PAINFUL IN HER LIKEWISE THE LEFT EYE WAS FIRST AFFECTED AND MUCH THE MOST DIFFICULT OF CURE CAUSTICS BEHIND THE EARS AND VITRIOLIC V O L LI M COLLY82 MERCURY HIGHEST LOWEST COLLYRIUMS CURED HER BUT THREE CAUSTICS WERE PUT BEHIND THE LEFT EAR BEFORE THAT EYE WAS WELL OCT 67 43 VERY WET MANY HORSES DIED THIS MONTH OF A PESTILENTIAL FEVER THEY HAD THE SYMPTOMS MARKHAM DESCRIBES IN HIS CHAPTER OF PESTILENTIAL HENDUNG INFUSED IN STALE URINE WHICH MARK HAM RECOMMENDS WAS FOUND SERVICE ABLE MANY PEOPLE WERE RUINED BY THE LOSS OF ALL THEIR HORSES BUT NONE DIED THAT HAD PLENTY OF THE JUICE OF RUE IT IS REMARKABLE THAT NO HORSES HAD THIS DISTEMPER BUT THOSE ON THE SALTS OF THE DIFFERENT RIVERS MR POLLARD EDMUNSON A GENTLEMAN ON THE EAST ERN SHORE OF CHESSAPEAK TOLD ME HE LOST ALMOST EVERY HORSE BY THIS DISORDER AT HIS HOME PLANTATION THE WATER THERE IS SALT AND NOT ONE IN A FOREST PASTURE ABOUT A MILE OFF NOV 65 33 THE DISEASE AMONG HORSES IS OVER ON THE 10TH DAY OF THIS MONTH THERE WAS AS SEVERE A GUST OF THUNDER AND LIGHT NING AS IS COMMON IN JULY OR

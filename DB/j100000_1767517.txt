dissemination is favored by wet wea ther and by the crowding of the insects into restricted areas as the food supply decreases In this case the dis ease is left wholly to spontaneous development but it is reasonable to suppose that were the disease producing bacteria artificially cultivated and multiplied which is readily done in properly equipped laboratories and held as a magazine to supply the germs as soon as the first in sects are seen the pests might be swept away at a merely nominal cost at the beginning instead of at the end of their destructive career This is not all theory In the United States excellent results against the clinch bug have been obtained in Kansas Illinois and other states In Europe very satisfactory results have been obtained in combatting the white grub Melolantha vulgaris by means of the fungus Botrytis tenella and B bassiana In this country the most satisfactory results have been obtained from Sporotrichinm densum and Empursa several sp ecies This method of combatting noxious insects is now at tracting widespread attention from German and French scientists and promises much for the future LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Correspondents are requested to be as brief as possible The writers name is in all cases required as a proof of good faith On request in advance one hundred copies of the number con taining his communication will be furnished free to any corres pondent The editor will be glad to publish any queries consonant with the character of the journal INDUCTIVE PSYCHOLOGY I WISH to thank you for your appreciative words and criticisms of my Inductive Psychology which was has tily prepared for private use rather than to stand the test of criticism for general circulation I am pleased that more defects are not at once discovered I think how ever a little explanation from me is necessary upon one point In writing every sentence of the book my prin cipal question was what experience of the pupil will this appeal to  what thoughts and observations will it suggest  and not how can I most logically state these truths so as to completely cover the subject  The aim is not a com plete treatment of the science but an introduction to it that shall give the pupil psychological knowledge power and vocabulary that will enable him to continue the study in both living subjects and books To such an extent is this true that inferences as to what portions of psychol ogy I value most cannot be correctly made for my prin ciple of selection was not scientific value and importance but pedagogical value to the pupil at this stage of the study Now Mr Editor however much you may disagree with my use of the word inductive if you will lay aside the expectations that the word inductive in the title aroused in your mind you cannot but see that the book is peda gogically essentially different in method from any other textbook on psychology I feel as if explanation on this point is due to myself for if the book is not different in method of presentation from other psychologies I have no excuse for writing it The following however from a teacher of psychology confirms me in the belief that I have such an excuse The book is the best I know of from the teachers standpoint It illustrates a method of treating the subject which I find in no other book So far as I know most textbooks have been elaborated with out regard to the pedagogics of the subject but only the logical and scientific arrangement of the facts enumer ated but I feel that this cannot be said of yours E A KIRKPATRICK Winona Minn Sept 251 893 219 THE SOUNDS OF R As Mr Melville Bell complains in your October num ber that the sounds of R have been treated unscien tifically in my Introduction to Phonetics Sonnen schein London and Macmillan New York 1891 I beg to observe that the difference between us arises from the difference in the facts observed by each In my pronunciation for instance and in that of culti vated English people of the present day his ear would I am sure observe no difference between alms and arms or between laud and lord In my treatment of the r sounds in English I am sup ported by the evidence of all competent observers of the best English spoken in the south of England in the pres ent day and the leading phoneticians are also agreed in regarding this as standard English I refer to such men as Dr Sweet Prof Johan Storm of Christiania and Prof Victor of Marburg If I were making a study of American English it is probable that my observations would be in accord with those of Mr Melville Bell LAURA SOAMES Brighton England THE ABSENCE OF AIR FROM THE MOON SEEING in the journal Nature of London date August 31 1893 the announcement of a paper entitled The Moons Atmosphere and the Kinetic Theory of Gasses to be read next week at the meeting of the British Association at Nottingham by the author Mr G H Bryan and since this subject was treated by me in Nature Nov 7 1878 15 years ago I wrote to the author Mr G HI Bryan in reference to this He has informed me today by post that this subject was dealt with in your journal Science of Feb 24 last by Sir Robert Ball who sent his communi cation to you as original although Mr Bryan considers it identical in substance with my letter in Nature above mentioned entitled A question Raised by the Observed Absence of an Atmosphere in the Moon  loe cit sup As Sir Robert Ball makes no mention in your journal of my letter in Nature I merely wish to claim just priority here for the theory as mine and not his since it is discussed as hisSir Robert Ballsin subsequent numbers of Science such as that for August 18 1893 in a paper by Prof Liveing of Cambridge England who suggests a further application of the theory in an article entitled The Aemosphere of Stellar Space To make a reclaim is somewhat of a task and it would be fitting if an authors work were voluntarily recognized without his incentive but I cannot do otherwise under the cir cumstances than mention the matter to you in this letter Mr Bryan informs me that his paper deals with the bear ing of statistical calculations on the theory and he makes no claim to originality except in the numerical results arrived at There may doubtless have been some advantage in Sir Robert Ball treating of the theory in question in your journal but I am surprised at his not mentioning my name in connection with the theory S TOLVER PRESTON Hamburgh Germany Sept 9 FOSSILS OF THE BRIDGEPORT QUARRIES ONE interested in geology while looking over the fine exhibit of Wards Natural Science Establishment in the Anthropological building at the Worlds Fair and also the geological exhibit in the Government building will notice that the finest crinoids and other fossils of the upper Silurian Niagara Terrane are labeled Bridgeport Ill Looking up Bridgeport on the map myself and friend found it to be only a portion of Chicago situated October 20 I893220 SCIENCE on the Chicago River Taking an Archer Avenue car from down town we soon found the limestone quarries for which we were seeking At this place the Niagara Lime stone crops out and having been found to produce a very good quality of lime has been extensively mined and large lime kilns erected Having obtained a permit from the office of the Lime Company we descended into the pit which on looking up from the bottom appeared like a large amphitheatre of rock They had just finished blasting before we arrived hence we found the place most favorable for collecting fossils For several hours we climbed over the rough masses of rock hammer in hand and stowed away in a large bag the choice specimens found The most abund ant fossil was an undetermined species of Macrostylo crinus of which we collected several dozen fine speci mens Next in abundance was the large crinoid Siphono crinus nobilis Hall of which we collected eighteen choice specimens also specimens of the following crinoids Euca lyptocrinus chicagcensis E rotundus Holocystites alternatus and Caryocrinus ornatus Say The most abundant coral was Japhrentis Turbinatum Hall We also found Platy ceras Campanulatum Amphiccelia neglecta McChesney Trilobites Brachiopods and a very fine Ammon ite In this way one interested in geology while visiting Chicago may fill in an odd day by collecting some inter esting specimens PAUL VAN RIPER Niles Mich COON CATS SPEAKING of cats I saw in a private house in Chicago recently two cats which the owners called coon cats They had been obtained in the edge of the forest around Moosehead Lake and it was claimed that they were hybrids or descendants of hybrids of the domestic cat and the raccoon They were larger than the ordinary house cat had very coonlike countenances and bushy coonlike tails that were always expanded One had the habit of ascending something high and resting stretched out and their motions when in a little hurry were a coon like gallop The claws were retractile the foot digitigrade I did not examine the dentition but could find nothing but appearance that indicated a coon kinship They interbred with the common cat Can some one tell me more about them J N BASKETT Mexico Mo Aug 28 DAMAGE TO COTTON BY LIGHTNING THE communication of Mr Frank E Emery on Damage to Cotton by Lightning in your issue of Sept 8 prompts me to communicate the following facts bearing directly on Mr Emerys subject For thirty years prior to 1890 some cotton fields at Goldsboro N C owned by the State for the use of the Colored Insane Asylum have been struck by lightning Occasionally the fields were spared and then again they suffered two or three times a year Each stroke would destroy from onequarter to onehalf an acre The light ning would strike very near the same place every year In the year 1890 electric light wires were run from the city lighting plant to the Asylum During the summers of 1890 and 1891 the poles near where the lightning was accustomed to strike were badly split up In the sum mer of 1892 lightning arresters were placed near these points and since that time there has been no trouble from lightning Since the wires have been strung on this pole line lightning has not struck the fields the wires protecting them perfectly Vol XXII No 559 These facts are vouched for by a gentleman residing in Goldsboro who lived on the farm above mentioned before it came into the possession of the State and for the last few years has been manager of the electric plant thus being acquainted with all lightning troubles that his plant has had to contend with A F McKissicK Auburn Ala Sept 23

teresting and his investigations will doubtless lead to im portant economic results As an item of news in this connection I may say that I have a neighbor who made sugar from corn stalks nearly forty years ago She ex tracted the sucrose partly by diffusion boiling the stalks in water and then by pressure and obtained a sugar nearly white in color and excellent in flavor and sweet ening power A STEVENSON Arthur Ontario CURIOUS EARS OF INDIAN CORN MR HERSHEY a recent correspondent in Science speaks of a maize plant producing a cob at the summit of the stalk where we usually find only the tassel of staminate flowers Such cases I think cannot be uncommon I ob served three last year within a small plot of a few square yards This year a neighbor showed me an even more curious variation of the same kind The stalk terminated in a spike of about 8 inches long the upper half of which had contained staminate flowers while the lower half which was considerably stouter contained immature grains It was in fact a small cob without husks and the grains were greenish inconsequence Branching off from the stalk at the base of the cobs were two slender pedicels of the remains of staminate flowers The cob on this specimen contained no staminate flowers but they were quite numerous on the stunted cobs which I saw last year A STEVENSON Arthur Ontario EVOLUTION OF SCIENCE TEACHING IN PRIMARY SCHOOLS IN Science No 554 Dr George G Groff well shows how insufficient are the means provided in certain profes sional schools for properly instructing and training teachers for science teaching in secondary and primary schools The numerical results of his tabulations cer tainly place the normal schools of Pennsylvania on the side of tradition as against progress The ratio of gram mar teachers to science teachers is five to four and the number of teachers of mathematics is approximately that of the teachers of science

J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,108179,RESEARCHES IN EMBRYOLOGY SECOND SERIES,I206994,L 307 J XIX RESEARCHES IN EMBRYOLOGYSECOND SERIES BY MARTIN BARRY AD FRSE FELLOW OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS IN EDINBURGH COMMUNICATED BIJ P M ROGET MFD SEC RS RECEIVED MARCH 28READ APRIL 18 1839 IN A FORMER COMMUNICATION T I DESCRIBED THE MAMMIFEROUS OVUM IN ITS SEVERAL PE RIODS OF FORMATION THE PRESENT PAPER IS INTENDED TO TRACE IT THROUGH THE EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT WHAT IS KNOWN OR SUPPOSED TO BE KNOWN OF THE EVOLUTION OF THE MNAMMIFEROUS OVUM IN ITS EARLY STAGES MAINLY RESTS ON OBSERVATIONS MADE NOT IN MAMMALS BUT IN BIRDS DIRECT OBSERVATIONS HAVE BEEN SO FEW AND SO ISOLATED THAT BETWEEN THE TIME WHEN THE COITUS TAKES PLACE AND THAT OF THE INCIPIENT APPEARANCE OF THE VERTEBRAE THERE EXISTS A DARK PERIOD OF WHICH VERY LITTLE IS REALLY KNOWN THIS HIATUS IT IS ONE OF THE OBJECTS OF THE PRESENT PAPER TO ASSIST IN FILLING UP THE OVA OF THE VERTEBRATA GENERALLY WERE THE SUBJECTS OF INVESTIGATION IN MY LAST MEMOIR IT BEING THEN INTENDED TO DEMONSTRATE THE ESSENTIAL IDENTITY IN FOL RM OF CER TAIN STRUCTURES WHICH EXIST IN THE FOUR CLASSES OF VERTEBRATED ANIMALS THE OVUM AS THEN CONSIDERED WAS IN A STATE OF COMPARATIVE THOUGH NOT ENTIRE REPOSE THE PRE SENT SERIES OF RESEARCHES ON THE CONTRARY INVESTIGATES THE OVUM WHILE UNDERGOING RAPID CHANGES IN ORDER THE MORE COMPLETELY TO WATCH THE PROGRESS OF THESE CHANGES IT SEEMED DESIRABLE TO CONFINE THE ATTENTION TO A SINGLE SPECIES THE ONE I SELECTED WAS THE RABBIT TO WHICH ANIMAL ALL GENERAL REMARKS MADE IN THIS PAPER WILL REFER FOR THE ILLUSTRATION OF A SUBJECT LIKE THE PRESENT WHICH MAY BE COMPARED TO A SE RIES OF METAMORPHOSES IT WILL BE OBVIOUS THAT WE OUGHT TO BE IN POSSESSION OF A SUITE OF STAGES THESE I TRUST HAVE BEEN OBTAINED THOUGH NOT WITHOUT DIFFICULTIES AT TIMES IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE DISCOURAGING AND INSEPARABLE FIOM THE VERY NATURE OF THE SUB JECTDIFFICULTIES FELT BY DE GRAAFCRUIKSHANK HAIGHTONPREVOST AND DUMASBAER AND OTHERS BUT THERE EXISTED OTHER DIFFICULTIES THE BEST EVIDENCE OF WHICH IS THE RE SULT THAT I AM COMPELLED HOWEVER RELUCTANTLY TO CALL IN QUESTION SOME VIEWS WHICH WERE CONSIDERED TO BE SETTLED AND THESE EMBRACING POINTS OF CARDINAL IMPORTANCE FOR EXAMPLE ACCORDING TO MY OBSERVATIONS THE EMBRYO DOES NOT ARISE IN THE SUBSTANCE OF A MEMBRANE THE DISCREPANCIES TO BE FOUND IN THE ACCOUNTS OF AUTHORS ON THE OVUM OF MAUN T RESEARCHES IN EMBRYOLOGY FIRST SERIES PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 1838 PART II P 301  AMONG THE FIGURES WILL BE FOUND SEVERAL FROM THE TIGER FOR AN OVARY OF WHICH ANIMAL I AM INDEBTED TO THE KINDNESS OF PROFESSOR OWENDR MARTIN BARRYS RESEARCHES IN EMBRYOLOGY MALIA AND THE CONFUSED NOMENCLATURE OF ITS MEMBRANES APPEAR REFERABLE TO THE AB SENCE OF EARLY OBSERVATIONS IN CONTINUOUS SUCCESSION OBSERVERS HAVE NOT DIRECTED THEIR ATTENTION TO THE OVUM POST COITUM BEFORE IT LEAVES THE OVARY AND THEY CANNOT BE SAID TO HAVE THOROUGHLY EXAMINED IT IN THE FALLOPIAN TUBE NOW SO RAPID ARE THE CHANGES WHICH THE OVUM UNDERGOES AT THE PERIOD IN QUESTION THAT HAD I NOT VERY OFTEN SEEN IT IN BOTH OF THOSE LOCALITIES IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME AT LEAST TO UN DERSTAND IT IN THE UTERUS AND IN PROOF THAT OTHERS FAILED TO DO SO IT MAY BE STATED THAT OVA OF THE DOG MEASURING HALF A LINE HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED BY EMINENT OBSERVERS AS CONSISTING OF A SINGLE MEMBRANE WHEREAS IN THE RABBIT ACCORDING TO MY OBSER VATIONS OVA OF STILL MINUTER SIZE MAY CONSIST OF FOUR MEMBRANES IN ADDITION TO THE EMBRYO ONE OF THESE MEMBRANES BEING COMPOSED OF TWO LAMINAE TO WHICH IT MAY BE ADDED THAT I FIND ONE MEMBRANE TO DISAPPEAR BY LIQUEFACTION WITHIN THE OVUM WHILE THE LATTER IS IN THE FALLOPIAN TUBE FROM WHAT HAS BEEN STATED IT WILL BE OBVIOUS THAT IN UNDERTAKING RESEARCHES IN SO DIFFICULT A SUBJECT AS THAT OF EMBRYOLOGY THE MIND SHOULD NOT BE PREOCCUPIED WITH ANY THEORY I CERTAINLY HAD NONE TO ESTABLISH IF I WAS AT ALL PREPOSSESSED IT WAS IN FAVOUR OF EXISTING DOCTRINES AND IT HAS BEEN IN SPITE OF SUCH PREPOSSESSION THAT FACT AFTER FACT HAS GRADUALLY BUT IRRESISTIBLY COMPELLED ME TO FORM OTHER VIEWS IN THE FOLLOWING PAGES THERE WILL BE FOUND NO SPECULATIONS AS I HAVE CONFINED MYSELF TO A SIMPLE DELINEATION OF APPEARANCES AND TO THE MOST OBVIOUS CONCLUSIONS ARISING FROM THEM IF IN ANY POINTS I HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN THAT INDULGENCE WILL I TRUST BE AC CORDED WHICH MAY BE FAIRLY CLAIMED IN EXPLORING ONE OF THE MOST HIDDEN REGIONS OF PHYSIOLOGY THAT IN THE MAIN FACTS I HAVE NOT ERRED SEEMS PROBABLE FROM THE RE PEATED OPPORTUNITIES AFFORDED FOR THEIR CONFIRMATION THE NUMBER OF RABBITS EX AMINED CONSIDERABLY EXCEEDS A HUNDRED AND I HAVE RECORDED IN MY NOTES THE PARTICULAR RESULTS REGARDING EIGHTYNINE BESIDES OVA THAT WERE STILL PRESENT IN THE OVARY AND APPARENTLY DESTINED TO ESCAPE NINETYTHREE HAVE BEEN FOUND IN THE FALLOPIAN TUBE AND TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTYSIX IN THE UTERUS I HAVE KEPT A SEPARATE RECORD OF THE MEASUREMENTS AND OTHER PARTICULARS OF MOST OF THESE TABLES WILL BE GIVEN PAR 319 SHOWING THE DIAMETER GENERAL CONDITION AND LOCALITY OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTYSIX OF THE MINUTER OF THESE OVA VERY FEW OF WHICH EXCEEDED IN DIAMETER HLALF A PARIS LINE AND BY FAR THE GREATER NUMBER WERE CONSIDERABLY BELOW THIS SIZE SOME INDEED NOT EX CEEDING YRTH AND EVEN TH OF A PARIS LINE OF THESE OVA I HAVE PRESERVED SIXTYSIX THE FOREGOING WILL SERVE TO SHOW THAT MY CONCLUSIONS HAVE NOT BEEN DRAWN FROM SO LITARY FACTS OR ISOLATED OBSERVATIONST T THE FOLLOWING TESTIMONY TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THE HISTORY OF DEVELOPMENT IS FROM THE PEN OF AN EMINENT OBSERVER E HUSCHKE IN MECKELS ARCHIV VOL VI P 1  SYSTEMATIC PHYSIOLOGY RESTS ESPECIALLY ON IT AND CAN NEVER RAPIDLY ADVANCE UNLESS IT BECOMES MORE PERFECT FOR THIS IT IS WHICH GIVES TO THE PHILOSOPHER THE MATERIAL WHEREWITH TO REAR A SOLID FABRIC OF ORGANIC LIFE HENCE IN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OUR ENDEAVOURS OUGHT MORE THAN IS NOW THE CASE TO HAVE REFERENCE TO IT IN OTHER WORDS WE SHOULD CONSTANTLY EXAMINE NOT ONLY EVERY ORGAN BUT EVERY MATERIAL AND ALSO EVERY ACTION WITH THE INQUIRY HOW DID THEY ORIGINATE  308DR MARTIN BARRYS RESEARCHES IN EMBRYOLOGY THE MEASUREMENTS TTLROUGHOUT THIS PAPER AS IN THE FORMER ONE ARE STATED IN FRAC TIONS OF A PARIS LINE AND THUS EXPRESSED  AS A SIMPLE MODE OF REDUCING THIS FRACTION INTO WHAT IS VERY NEARLY THE EQUIVALENT FRACTION OF AN ENGLISH INCH I RE COMMEND INULTIPLYING THE DENOMINATOR OF THE FORMER BY 11 SEE THE  TABLE OF MEASUREMENTS PAR 320 THE ACTUAL SIZES OF SOME OF THE OVA ARE REPRESENTED AT THE FOOT OF PLATES VI AND VII THE MATURE AND THE IMMATURE OVUM 120 THE DIFFERENCE PERCEPTIBLE BETWEEN OVA IN THESE TWO STATES APPEARS TO ME TO CONSIST IN THE CONDITION OF THE YELK IN THE IMMATURE OVUM THE YELK CONTAINS SEPA RATE OILLIKET GLOBULES DIFFUSED IN A FLUID PLATE V FIG 85 D  WHILE IN THE OVUM THAT IS MATURE THE YELK PRESENTS A PERIPHERAL STRATUM SOMETIMES APPEARING GRANULOUS AND AT OTHERS SEEMING TO CONSIST OF VESICLES PRESSED TOGETHER INTO A POLYHEDRAL FORM ITS CENTRE BEING IN THE STATE OF FLUID 121 THE GLOBULES OF THE YELK JUST MENTIONED AS OILLIKE IN THEIR APPEARANCE IN THE IMMATURE OVUM FIG 85 D ARE IN REALITY VESICLES IN FIG 87 ARE SOME OF THOSE VESI CLES FROM AN IMMATURE OVUTN OF THE TIGER IN WHICH ANIMAL I FOUND THEM EXCEEDINGLY DISTINCT BUT BESIDES BEING TRUE VESICLES THOSE GLOBULES CONTAIN OBJECTS WHICH THEM SELVES ARE ALSO VESICLES THE LATTER IN SOME INSTANCES PRESENTIHG OPACITIES IN THEIR IN TERIOR AND THEY ARE OFTEN OBSERVED TO BE PRESSED INTO AN IRREGULAR SHAPE  122 THE GLOBULES CONTAINED IN THE VESICLES T CELLS REPRESENTED BY DR SCHWANN  FROM THE YELKCAVITY OF A HENS EGG DO NOT EXHIBIT THE APPEARANCE OF VESICLES SO DE CIDEDLY AS THE ABOVE IN THE CAT HOWEVER I HAVE FOUND THE VESICLES OF THE YELK TO CONTAIN A GLOBULE VERY MUCH RESEMBLING THAT JUST REFERRED TO AS FIGURED BY SCHWANN YET THE OUTER VESICLES HAD THE SAME HIGH REFRACTING POWER AS THOSE FROM THE TIGER P1 V FIG 87 AND IN THIS RESPECT THEREFORE DIFFERED FROM THOSE IN THE FIGURE BY SCHWANN IS THE DIFFERENCE REFERABLE TO A DIFFERENCE IN AGE F  EFFECTS PRODUCED ON THE OVUM IN THE OVARY BY MACERATION 123 ON A FORMER OCCASION 1 C PAR 50 I REFERRED TO THE EFFECTS OF MACERATION AS INCREASING THE PROBABILITY THAT A PROPER MEMBRANE OF THE YELK EXISTED GENERALLY IN THE CLASS MAMMALIA FOR IT WAS SHOWN THAT ALTHOUGH THE THICK TRANSPARENT MEMBRANE OF THE OVUM OR ZONA PELLUCIDA F BY IMBIBITION HAD BECOME DISTENDED THE YELK T THE TERM  OILLIKE IS USED AS IN MY FORMER MEMOIR TO DESCRIBE SIMPLY THE APPEARANCE AND NOT THE NA TURE OF THE GLOBULES TO WHICH IT IS APPLIED T IT IS AN INTERESTING FACT AS SEVERAL FIGURES IN MY  FIRST SERIES I

RETAINED ITS SIZE AND FORM IN THE PRESENT PAPER PLATE V FIG 88 AFFORDS A PROOF OF THIS IN AN OVUM OF THE TIGER HERE HOWEVER IN ADDITION TO THE YELK CONTINUING SPHERICAL ITS PROPER MEMBRANE E WAS VERY DISTINCTLY VISIBLE 124 THE NMOST CONSPICUOUS THANGE PRODUCED BY MACERATION IS DISTENTION OF THE NENEMBRANE BIUT I HAVE OBSERVED THE GERLMINAL VESICLE ALSO BEFORE DISAPPEARING TO BE COME ELLIPTICAL SEE THE FIGURE JUST REFERRED TO AND ALSO FIG 89 WHICH EXHIBITS THE GERMINAL VESICLE C OF THE SAME OVUM ON A LARGER SCALE FROM THE GERMINAL SPOT B IN THIS INSTANCE THERE WERE SEEN TO HAVE ARISEN THREE MEMBRANES OR VESICLES ITS CENTRAL PART CONSISTING OF A FOURTH WHICH APPEARED TO CONTAIN A PELLUCID FLUID BE TWEEN THESE MEMBRANES OR VESICLES OF THE FORMER SPOT WERE GRANUILES AND A FLUID PAR 298 THE GRANULES BEING SITUATED FOR THE MOST PART NEAR THE CENTRE THE RUT 125 IT IS KNOWN THAT AT THIS PERIOD THERE OCCURS INCREASED VASCULARITY OF THE PARTS IN GENERAL AND OF CERTAIN GRAAFIAN VESICLES IN PARTICULAR I HAVE FOUND THAT THE NUM BER OF GRIAAFIAN VESICLES APPEARING TO BECOME PREPARED BY ENLARGEMENT AND VASCULAR ITY FOR DISCHARGING THEIR OVA EXCEEDS THE NUMBER OF THOSE THAT ACTUALLY DISCHARGE THEM PAR 126 THE FLUID OF THE GRAAFIAN VESICLES IN GENERAL WHICH ARE SITUATED AT THE SURFACE OF THE OVARY IS MORE VISCID NOW THAN AT OTHER SEASONS THE DEGREE OF THIS VISCIDITY HOWEVER AS WELL AS THE CONDITION OF THE YELK SEEMS TO DEPEND ON THE DEGREE OF ADVANCEMENT OF THE PERIOD IN QUESTION IN OVA TAKEN FROM ENLARGED AND VASCULAR GRAAFIAN VESICLES THE GERMINAL VESICLE IS AT THE PERIPHERY AND THE YELK MA TURE PAR 120 I HAVE ALSO IN SOME INSTANCES OBSERVED THE PERIPHERAL STRATUM OF THE YELL TO HAVE BECOME MORE FINELY GRANULOUS THAN IN USUAL STATES OF THE MATURE OVUM ANTE COITUM THE CHANGES IN THE TUNICA GRANULOSA AND RETINACULA INCIPIENT PERHAPS AT TLHIS PERIOD WILL BE MORE PARTICULARLY MENTIONED AMONG THOSE REFERABLE TO THE COITUS THE OVUMN IN THE OVARY POST COITUMNPIRST AND SECOND STA0ES OF DEVELOPMENT 126 I HAVE FOUND IT EXTREMELY DIFFICILT TO DISTINGUISH WITH PIECISION BETWEEN THE CHANGES REFERABLE TO THE RUT AND THE FURTHER CHANGES RESULTING FROMN THE COITUS FOR REASONS GIVEN IN THE INTRODUCTION TO THIS MEMOIR IT DID NOT SEEMI SUFFICIENT TO SEE THE STATE OF OVA FIRST IN THE FALLOPIAN TUBE BUT THEN IT WAS EQUTALLY UNSATISFACTORY TO EXAMINE OVA STILL IN THE OVARY FOR AT FIRST I WAS NOT IN POSSESSION OF CANY INEANS OF DISTINGUISHING THOSE THAT WERE REALLY DESTINED TO BE DISCHARGED AS IN ADDITION TO THE GR AAFIAN VESICLES FROM WHICH OVA WOULD HAVE BEEN EXPELLED I HAVE AS ALREADY STATED T AS RESEARCHES OF THIS KIND WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE OR THE RESULTS OF NO VALUE WITHOUT THE MEANS OF DETER MINING PRECISELY THE PERIOD BETWEEN THE COITUS AND THE DEATH OF THE ANIMAL I SHALL BE EXCUSED IF I MENTION FOR THE PROFESSIONAL READER 1 THAT PERSONS WERE EMPLOYED WHO MIGHT BE RELIED UPON AND WERE FULLY COMPETENT TO JUDGE OF THE CONDITION OF THE FEMALE RABBIT IN REFERENCE TO THE RUT 2 THAT THE COITUS WAS IN EVERY INSTANCE SEEN AND THE TIME AS WELL AS THE DEGREE OF READINESS FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE MALE PARTICULARLY NOTICED AND RE CORDED AND 3 THAT IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE COITUS THE FEMALE RABBIT WAS REMOVED AND KEPT SEPARATE FROM THE MALE 310DR MARTIN BARRYS RESEARCHES IN EMBRYOLOGY GENERALLY FOUND SEVERAL OTLLERS THAT HAD BECOME ENLARGED AND VASCULAR PAR 125 IT THEREFORE WAS AN OBJECT OF GREAT INTEREST TO MEET WITH OVA THAT WERE ON THE POINT OF ENTERING THE TUBE 127 THE PERIODS OF 4 6 8 AND 8K HOURS POST COITUM WERE FOUND TOO SHORT THE OVA BEING STILL WITHIN THE OVARY AND APPARENTLY NOT VERY NEAR THE TIME OF THEIR EX PULSION A RABBIT WAS EXAMINED AT ELEVEN HOURS WHEN THE OVA WERE FOUND TO HAVE MADE THEIR EXIT FROMN THAT ORGAN AND ONE AT TEN HOURS WITH THE SAME RIESULT AN OTHER WAS KILLED AT NINE HOURS THE OVA WERE STILL WITHIN THE OVARY AND THEIR GRAAFIAN VESICLES PRESENTED NO DECIDED INDICATION OF AN APPROACHING RUPTURE I TRIED 9KI HOURS WHEN THE OVA WERE AGAIN FOUND WITHIN THE OVARY WHILE IN ANOTHER INSTANCE AT NINE HOURS THEY HAD ESCAPED THIS WAS DISCOURAGING BUT IT SEEMED WORTH WHILE TO PER SEVERE AT LENGTH AFTER NEARLY A SCORE OF RABBITS HAD BEEN DEVOTED TO ANATOMICAL INSPECTION FOR THE SINGLE OBJECT OF DETERMINIING THE CONDITION IN WHICH THE OVUM LEAVES THE OVARY THLE PARTS WERE FOUND IN A STATE PRECISELY WHAT I HAD SO RMUCH DESIRED TO MEET WITH ONE OF THESE ANIMALS AT TEN HOURS YIELDING ME TWO OVA THAT HAD LEFT THE OVARY AND ADVANCED AN INCH INTO THE TUBE AND TWO OTHERS THAT WERE STILL IN THE OVARY BUT BEYOND ALL DOUBT ON THE POINT OF FOLLOWING THEM 128 ACCOLDING TO MY OBSERVATIONS THEN OVA OF THE RABBIT DESTINED TO BE DEVE LOPED ARE FREQUENTLY DISCHARGED FROM THE OVARY IN THE COURSE OF NINE OR TEN HOURS POST COITUM BURDACHT REFERS TO ONLY ONE AUTHORITY ON THIS SUBJECT STATING THAT CRUIK SHANK SAW THE GR AAFIAN VESICLES OF THE RABBIT TO BURST IN THE SHORLT PERIOD OF TWO HOURS FROM CRUIKSHANKS PAPER HOWEVER IT APPEARS THAT THIS WAS OBSERVED IN A SINGLE INSTANCE ONLY KUHLEMANN FOUND GTAAFIAN VESICLES OF THE SHEEP TO HAVE BURST AT THE END OF THE FIRST DAY AND HAUSMANN I OBSERVED THAT IN THE HOG THEY HAD NEARLY ALL BURST IN SEVENTEEN HOURS THE CONCLUSIONS OF PREVOST AND DUMAS AS TO THE TIME OF BURSTING OF THE GRAAFIAN VESICLES IN DOGS APPEATR TO REST CHIEFLY ON THE PERIOD WHEN THOSE OBSERVERS FOUND OVA IN THE ULTERUS FRORM WHICH NOTHING CAN BE DE TERMINED AS TO WHEN THEY LEFT THE OVARY I HAVE RECORDED IN MY NOTES SEVERAL IN STANCES IN WHICH AFTER A MUCH LONGER PERIOD THAN NINE OR TEN HOURS THE OVA IN THE RABBIT HAD NOT ESCAPED BUT IN THOSE INSTANCES THERE WAS NO PROOF THAT ANY OVA WERE DESTINED TO ESCAPEIN OTHER WORDS THAT THE COITUS HAD BEEN PRODUCTIVE STILL HOWEVER THE CONDITION OF THE ANIMAL AND MORE PARITICULARLY THE DEGREE OF ITS AD VANCEMNENT IN THE RUT PRIOBABLY OCCASION CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCES IN THIS RESPECT YET I AM SATISFIED THAT OVA VERY FIEQUENTLY LEAVE THE OVARY IN NINE OR TEN HOURS TO HAVE DETERMINED WHICH IT WILL BE HEREAFTER SEEN PAR 166 IS A POINT OF SOME IMPORTANCE 129 SEVERAL OBSERVERS APPEAR TO HAVE SUPPOSED THE OVA TO BE STILL PRESENT

RESEARCHES IN EMBRYOLOGY SUPPOSED TO BE THE OVUM WHAT IT REALLY WAS I SHALL ENDEAVOUR HEREAFTER TO RENDER PROBABLE PAR 155 BUT IT IS VERY UNLIKELY TO HAVE BEEN AN OVUM 130 IT APPEARS FROM THE OBSERVATIONS JUST MRADE KNOWN PAR 127 THAT IN THE RABBIT ALL THE OVA OF ONE IMPREGNATION ARE DISCHARGED AT ABOUT THE SAME TIRLME THIS IS OPPOSED TO THE OPINION OF PREVOST AND DUMAS 9 THAT IN THE RABBIT AT LEAST TWO DAYS ELAPSE BEFORE ALL THE OVA DESTINED TO BE DEVELOPED HAVE LEFT THE OVARY THAT I AM CORRECT IN THIS PARTICULAR IS RENDERED STILL MORE PROBABLE BY THE FACT THBAT IN THE FALLOPIAN TUBE AND IN THE BEGINNING OF THE UTERUS MINUTE OVA ARE GENERALLY THOUGH NOT IN EVERY INSTANCE MET WITH LYING VERY NEAR TOGETHER HAVING FOUND MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED OVA IN THE UTERUS AND TUBE I MAY PERHAPS VENTURE TO SPEAK WITH SOME CONFIDENCE AS TO THEIR PARTICULAR LOCALITIES WHICH IT HAS UNIFORMLY BEEN MY PRACTICE TO RECORD A GENERAL IDEA OF THE SITUATION IN WHICH MANY OF THE MINUTER OVA HAVE BEEN OBSERVED MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THLE TABLES PAR 319 131 IF MY ENDEAVOURS TO OBTAIN OVA WHEN JUST ON THE POINT OF ENTERING THE TUBE WERE FOR A LONG WHILE FRUITLESS UNEXPECTED FACTS WERE NOTICED AMPLY REPAYING ALL THE LABOUR IT WAS IN THE COURSE OF THOSE WEARISOME ENDEAVOURS THAT THE GERMINAL VE SICLE FIRST PRESENTED ITSELF IN SITUATIONS WHICH MADLE ME DOUBT ITS DISAPPEARING AT THE PERIOD HITHERTO SUPPOSED I SAW IT IN MATURE OVA HALFWAY BETWEEN THE SURFACE AND THE CENTRE OF THE YELKA LOCALITY WHICH WAS REMARKABLE FROM THE FACT THAT ANTE COITUM AND EVEN WHILE THLE OVUMN IS YET IMMATURE THE GERMINAL VESICLE IS SEEN TO HAVE PASSED TO THE SURFACE OF THE YELK NOW SUCH A SITUATION OF THE GERMINAL VESICLE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE ESCAPED MY ATTENTION IF THE OBSERVATION HAD NOT BEEN MRANY TIMES REPEATED YET ON A KNOWLEDGE OF THE FACT THAT THE GERMINAL VESICLE RETURNS TO THE CENTRE OF THE YELK DEPENDS THE POSSIBILITY OF FULLY UNDERSTANDING THE OVIL1UM IN SOME OF ITS FUTURE PHASES 132 I SHALL NOW DESCRIBE THLE CHANGES APPARENTLY RESULTING FROM SEXUAL CONNEXION OBSERVED IN THE OVUM OF THE RABBIT WHILE STILL WITHIN THE OVARY SOME MINUTE DETAILS WILL BE UNAVOIDABLE BUT SO FAR AS IS CONSISTENT WITH PERSPICUITY I SHALL ENDEAVOUR TO BE BRIEF 133 AFTER SOME HOURS THE GERMINAL VESICLE IS FOUND TO HAVE LEFT ITS SITUATION AT THE SURFACE OF THE YELK AND TO BE RETURNING TO ITS CENTRE FROMN WHENCE IT CAME ABOUT THE SAME TIME I HAVE OBSERVED TO HAVE ARISEN FROM THE SURFACE OF THE GERNMINAL SPOT A INEMBRANETHAT IS A VESICLEWHICH SPEEDILY ENLARGED SO AS TO APPLY ITSELF TO THE INNER SURFACE OF THE GERMINAL VESICLE THE VESICLE THUS PROCEEDING FROM THE SPOT OF COURSE IMBIBED THE FLUID OF THE GERMINAL VESICLE WHICH IN ITS NEW SITUATION APPEARED FINELY GRANULOUS AND YELLOWISHBROWN IN COLOUR THE GERMINAL VESICLE HAVING NOW TWO MEMBRANES WAS LESS TRANSPARENT AND LESS EASILY RUPTURED THAN BEFORE AND I HAVE T L C NO 189 P 199  IT IS AN INTERESTING FACT THAT IF A LARGER NUMBER OF OVA THAN USUAL ESCAPE FROM ONE OVARY A PROPORTIONALLY SMALLER NUMBER IS DISCHARGED FROM THE OTHER 312DR MARTIN BARR S RESEARCHES IN EMBRYOLOGY OBSERVED WHAT APPEARED TO BE THE FURTHER EFFECT OF THIS ADDITIOAL MEMBRANE IN THE VESICLE REMAINING VISIBLE CASTING A SHADOW AND EVEN NOT AT ALL COLLAPSING AFTER BEING RUPTURED PLATE V FIG 92 134 THE GERMINAL SPOT PREVIOUSLY ON THE INTERNAL SURFACE OF THE GERMINAL VESICLE IS SOON OBSERVED TO OCCUPYITS CENTRE PRESENTING THUS THE SAME CHANGEIN RELATION TO THE GERMINAL VESICLE AS THE LATTER UNDERGOES IN REFERENCE TO THE YELKBALL THE SPOT BECOMYES VERY MUCH ENLARGED AND IN ITS CENTRE THERE IS NOW A PELLUCID POINT 135 ON SOME OCCASIONS WHEN THE GERMINAL VESICLE WAS OBSERVED TO BE RETURNING FRON THE SURFACE TO THE CENTRE OF THE YELK THE YELK VIEWED WITH REFLECTED LIGHT EXHI BITED THE APPEARANCE OF MASSES BETWEEN WHICH THERE WAS A PELLUCID FLUID AT OTHER TIMES I HAVE SEEN WITH GREAT DISTINCTNESS A CAVITY IN THE CENTRE OF THE YELK PLATE V FIG 93 SHOWS THE GERMINAL VESICLE C JUST ENTERING SUCH A CAVITY THIS FIGURE REPRE SENTS A STRATUM APPARENTLY OF VESICLES FORMING THE PERIPHERY OF THE YELK SUBS ENTLYTHIS STRATUM HAS DISPPEARED THE PROPER MEMRANE OF THE YELK HAVING N THE MEAN TIME THICKENED AND THE YELK HAS BECOME FLUID AT ITS SURFAE WHILE ITS ENTRAL PORTION IN WHICH THE GERMINAL VESICLE NOW LIES HAS BECOME OBSCURE IN A STAGE STILL LATER MORE OF THE YELK HAS LIQUEFIED AND IN THE LIQUID ARE GRANULES THE CENTRAL PART OF THE YELK HAVING NOW AN ELLIPSOIDAL FORM PLATE V FIGS 96 AND 97 136 THE PROPER MEMBRANE OF THE YELK WAS SHOWN IN MY FIRST SERIES 1 C PLATE VIII FIG 70 E TO BE PRESENT AT AN EARLY PERIOD IN THE EXISTENCE OF THE OVUM BUT STATED TO BE FROM ITS TENUITY IN MAMMALIA GENERALLY INVISIBLE AT THE PERIOD AT PRESENT UNDER CONSIDERATION IT SUDDENLY THICKENS HIGHLY REFRACTING LIGHT PLATE V FIGS 94 96 97 E AND IS OFTEN REDDISHBROWN IN COLOUR THIS THICKENING OF THE PROPER MEMBRANE OF THE YELK IS NOT AMONG THE EARLIEST OF THE CHANGES RESULTING FROM SEXUAL CONNEXION BUT FOLLOWS THOSE ABOVE DESCRIBED AND FOR THE MOST PART TAKES PLACE IMTEDIATELY BEFORE THE DISCHARGE OF THE OVUM FROM THE OVARY THE STRATUM OF VE SICLES REFERRED TO IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH FIG 93 HAS NOW DISAPPEARED 137 THE THICK TRANSPARENT MEMBRANE OF THE OVUM OR ZONA PELLUCIDA F BEGINS TO IMBIBE FLULD AND DISTEND SO THAT A MINUTE SPACE FILLED WITH FLUID IS VISIBLE BETWEEN IT AND THE YELKBALL PLATE V FIGS 96 AND 97 E AND F THIS CHANGE FOLLOWS THE INCIPIENT THICKENING OF THIE PROPER MEMBRANE OF THE VELK E AND IN SOME INSTANCES IS NOT APPRECIABLE UNTIL AFTER THE OVUM HAS MADE ITS EXIT FROM THE OVARY 138 THE TUNICA GRANULOSA PLATE V FIGS 93 96 97 G WAS SHOWN ON A FORMER OCCASION 1 C PAR 647 1 88 TO BE AT FIRST A SPHERICAL AND SUBSEQUENTLY A FLATTENED ACCUMULATION ON THE OVUM OF THE PECULIAR GRANULES OR RATHER VESICLES OF THE OVISA AT THE PERIOD IN QUESTION ITS VESICLES LANG LESS TENACIOUSLY TOGETHER AND FREQUENTLY APPEAR TO BE PASSING INTO A FLUID STATE THE TAILLIKE APPENDAGES AS I HAVE CALLED THEM OF THIS TUNIC ARE NOW VERY DISTINETLY SEEN TO BE CONTINUED INTO THE FOUR PER SISTENT RETINACULA EVIDENTLY CONTRIBUTING

LUCID DROPS OF FLUID 140 MOST OF THE CHANGES NOW MENTIONED I HAVE FOUND TO TAKE PLACE BEFORE THE OVUM LEAVES THE OVARY YET CERTAIN OF THE LATER ONES IN SOME INSTANCES ARE NOT OB SERVABLE UNTIL THE OVUM HAS PASSED INTO THE FALLOPIAN TUBE FROMI MY OBSERVATIONS THEREFORE IT APPEARS THLAT THERE IS NO CONDITION OF THE OVUM UNIFORIM IN ALL RESPECTS WHICH CAN BE POINTED OUT AS THAT IN WHICH IT IS EXPELLED THOUGH THE SAME OBSERVA TIONS LEAD ME TO CONCLUDE THAT PLATE V FIGS 96 AND 97 PRESENT A STATE WHICIL IS FREQUENT WHEN THE DISCHARGE TAKES PLACE VIZ THE GERMINAL SPOT H HAS A CENTRAL PEL LUCID

FORMATION OF THE OVUM PAR 292 NOTE IN THE PRESENT PAPER ALSO IT WILL BE CONVE NIENT TO ADOPT THE SAME PLAN OF CONSIDERING THE OVUM IN SUCCESSIVE STAGES THESE HOWEVER OCCURRING POST COITUM WILL BE STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT I PROPOSE TO CONSIDER AS THE FIRST STAGE THAT REPRESENTED IN PLATE V FIG 93 AND AS THE SECOND STAGE THE CONDITION WHICH IS FREQUENT WHEN THE OVUM LEAVES THE OVARY FIGS 96 AND 97 142 TO OBTAIN THESE FACTS AND HAVE IT IN MY POWER TO STATE THEM WITH ANY DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE AND IN THE ORDER OF THEIR OCCURRENCE HAS BEEN AN UNDERTAKING OF NO COMMON DIFFICULTY AND THERE DID NOT EXIST SO FAR AS I COULD DISCOVER ANY RECORDED OBSERVATIONS BELONGING TO THIS PERIOD THAT MIGHT BE TAKEN AS A GUIDE LOCALITY IN WHICH THE OVURM ISFECUNDATED 143 AS TO THE PARTICULAR LOCALITY IN WHICH THE OVUMN BECOMNES SUSCEPTIBLE OF DE VELOPMENT PHYSIOLOGISTS ARE NOT AGREEDT SONME MAINTAIN THAT IT ACQUIRLES THIS SUSCEP TIBILITY BEFORE IT LEAVES THE OVARY OTHERS THAT THE CHANGE IS NOT EFFECTED UNTIL AFTER ITS EXPULSION FROM THAT ORGAN 144 IT IS NOT MY PURPOSE TO DISCUSS THE QUESTION WHETHER CONTACT OF THE SEIMINAL FLUID WITH THE OVUNI IS OR IS NOT ESSENTIAL TO IMPREGNATION YET PERHAPS IT IMAY BE PROPER FOR A MOMENT TO REFER TO THE POSSIBILITY OF THAT CONTACT WWHILE THE OVURM IS STILL WITHIN THE OVARY THIS HAVING BEEN DENIED 314DR MARTIN BARRYS RESEARCHES IN EMBRYOLOGY 145 PREVOST AND DUMAST MAINTAIN THAT THE SPERMATOZOA DO NOT PENETRATE SO FAT AS TO THE OVARY AND CONCLUDE THAT IN ALL MAMMALS IMPREGNATION TAKES PLACE IN THE HORNS OF THE UTERUS I DO NOT DOUBT THAT THE OBSERVATIONS OF PREVOST AND DUMAS WERE ACCURATE FOR IN SEVENTEEN OUT OF NINETEEN INSTANCES IN THE RABBIT THOUGH THE PARTS WERE GENERALLY EXAMNINED WHILE STILL WARM I WAS UNABLE TO DISCOVER SPERMA TOZOA IN THE FLUID COLLECTED FROM THE SURFACE OF THE OVARY IN THE OTHER TWO INSTANCES HOWEVER SPERMATOZOA OR AT LEAST ANIMALCULES EXACTLY LIKE THOSE I HAD BEEN ACCUS TOMED TO MEET WITH IN THE UTERUS AND VAGINA WERE REALLY FOUND ON THE OVARY I SHOULD RATHER SAY THAT ON ONE OF THOSE OCCASIONS SPERMATOZOA WERE SEEN WHILE ON THE OTHER IT WAS A SINGLE SPERMATOZOON THAT WAS OBSERVED SOME OF THE FORMER WERE ALIVE AND ACTIVE THOUGH NOT IN LOCOMOTION OTHERS WERE DEAD IN THAT CASE TWENTY FOUR HOURS POST COITUM THERLE WAS NEITHER ENLARGEMENT OF THE GRAAFIAN VESICLES NOR A HIGH DEGREE OF VASCULARITY IN ANY OF THE PARTS IN THE OTHER INSTANCE THE SINGLE SPER MATOZOON FOUND WAS DEAD AND THE OVA HAD ESCAPED NOW WHETHER THE SPERMATOZOA ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE IMPREGNATING POWER OF THE SEMINAL FLUID I DO NOT THINK IT NEEDFUL TO INQUIRE THE FACT THAT IN THE COURSE OF THESE RESEARCHES THEY HAVE BEEN MET WITH ON THE OVARY DEMONSTRATES THAT THE SEMINAL FLUID SOMETIMES PENETRATES AS FAR AS TO THE SURFACE OF THAT ORGAN WHETHER IT PENETRATES INTO ITS INTERIOR I AM UNABLE TO DETER MINE BUT CERTAINLY THE CHANGES ABOVE DESCRIBED AS TAKING PLACE POST COITUM IN THE CONDITION OF THE OVUM WHILE STILL WITHIN THE OVARY ARE TOO REMARKABLE NOT TO FAVOUR THE SUPPOSITION THAT IT DOES 146 THE CHANGES NOW MORE ESPECIALLY REFERRED TO WILL PRESENTLY BE SEEN THE GER MINAL VESICLE ANTE COITUM AFTER THE FORMATION OF THE YELK HAS BEGUN IS SITUATED IN THE CENTRE OF THE LATTER FROM THAT LOCALITY IT PASSES TO THE SURFACE OF THE YELK THE GERMINAL SPOT BEING SITUATED ON THE INTERNAL SURFACE OF THE GERMINAL VESICLE THE OVUM AS SHOWN ON A FORMER OCCASION 1 C PAR 85 IS CONVEYED FRONM THE CENTRE TO THE SURFACE OF THE GRAAFIANR VESICLE AND INDEED TO THAT PART OF THE SURFACE WHICHI IS SITUATED NEAREST TO THE EXTERIOR OF THE OVARY  BEING DETERMINATELY HELD BY THE RETINLACULA IN THIS SITUA TION L THE PROPER MEMBRANE OF THE YELK IS HITHERTO EXTREMELY THIN SUCH IS THE CONDITION OF THE MATURE OVUM ANTE COITUM THAT IS TO SAY ITS ESSENTIAL PARTS LIE AS NEAR AS POSSIBLE TO THE SURFACE OF THE OVUM POST COITUM BEFORE THE DISCHARGE OF THE T L C NO 189 P 199  SINCE THE ABOVE MEMOIR WAS PRESENTED TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY I HAVE LEARNT THAT PROFESSOR BISCIOFF OF HEIDELBERG HAD PREVIOUSLY FOUND SPERMATOZOA ON THE OVARY OF ANOTHER MAMMAL THE DOG PAR 278  IN REPEATED INSTANCES ALSO I HAVE FOUND THLLE GERMINAL VESICLE AT THAT PART OF THE SURFACE OF THE YELK WHICH WAS SITUATED NEAREST TO THE PERIPHERY OF THE GRAAFIAN VESICLE AND THEREFORE AS NEAR AS POSSIBLE TO THE SURFACE OF THE OVARY THIS ACCORDS WITH THE OBSERVATIONS OF R WAGNER THAT IN DYTISCUS MARGINALIS AND IN SOME OTHER INSECTS THE GERMINAL VESICLE ALWAYS APPEARS ON THAT SIDE OF THE OVARIAN TUBES WHICH IS DIRECTED TOWARDS THE CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN THUS IN A BUNCH OF OVARIAN TUBES THE VESICLE IS NEVER SITUATED AT THAT PART WHERE THE TUBES LIE ONE UPON ANOTHER BEITRAGE ZUR GESCHICHTE DER ZEUGUNG UND ENTWICKELUNG P 46 11 R WAGNER SUGGESTED THAT THE DISC MY TUNICA

OVARY THE GERMINAL SPOT PASSES TO THE CENTRE OF THE GERMNINAL VESICLE AND THE GERMINAL VESICLE RETURNS TO THE CENTRE OF THE YELK THE PROPER MEMBIRANE OF THE YELK SUDDENLY BECOMES THICKENED 147 SUCH ALTERATIONS SUGGEST THE PROBABILITY OF SOME SUDDEN AND IMPORTANT CHANGE HAVING BEEN EFFECTED IN THE CONDITION OF THE OVUMN AND MOREOVER THAT WHICH IS AL LOWED TO BE ITS MOST ESSENTIAL PART PREVIOUSLY

YELK PREVIOUSLY EXTREMELY THIN HAS SUDDENLY THICKENED THESE CHANGES WHICH I HAVE NO DOUBT WILL BE CONFIRMED BY FUTURE OBSERVERS RENDEL IT HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT THE OVUNM HAS UNDERGONE FECUNDATION THE NATURE OF THE CHANGES IS SUCH AS TO FAVOUR THE SUPPOSITION THAT THEY ARE PRODUCED BY CONTACT OF THE SEMINAL FLUID WITH THE OVUIM AND WE HAVE SEEN THEM TO TAKE PLACE WITHIN THE OVARY I THEREFORE SUPPOSE THE OVARY TO BE THE USUAL LOCALITY IN WHICH THE OVUM IS FECUNDATED STILL HOWEVER AS WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE OVARY IN SOME ANIMALS AT LEAST DISCHARGES OVA WHICH ARE NOT FECUNDATED THIS CHANGE MAY PERHAPS IN SOME INSTANCES TAKE PLACE IN THE OVIDUCT DISCHARGE OF THE OVUM FROM THE OVARY 148 THIS APPEARS TO BE EFFECTED IN PART AT LEAST AS SUPPOSED BYVALENTIN THROUGH THE OPERATION OF A VIS A TERGO THE LATTER BEING PRODUCED BY THE EXUBERANT GROWTH OF A REDDISH FLESHY MASS WHICH ACTS THROUGH THE MNEDIUM OF THE FLUID OF THE GRAAFIAN VESICLE THE PARTICULAR STRUCTURE ORIGINATING THAT FLESHY MASS I SHALL HAVE OCCASION TO REFER TO IN CONNEXION WITH THE OORPUS LUTEUM PAR 156 149 WHEN DESCRIBING IN MY FIRST SERIESI 1 C PAR 8091 THE OFFICES OF THE RE TINACULA PLATE V FIGS 85 86 93

DISTINGUISH THE LATTER FROM THE FORMER AFTER THE OVA HAVE BEEN DIS CHARGED THEREFORE THE OVARY OFTEN PRESENTS SEVERAL GRAAFIAN VESICLES WHICH ARE EN LARGED AND HIGHLY VASCULAR THESE AS WELL INDEED AS MANY OF THE MINUTER ONES SEEM TO BE ABSORBED AND DURING SEVERAL STAGES OF THAT PROCESS APPEARANCES OCCUR WHICH IT MAY BE WORTH WHILE TO MENTION AS FROMTN THEIR RESEMBLANCE TO SOME OF THE CHANGES

ORIGIN OF THE  MUCOUS LAMINA OF THE SOCALLED GERMINAL MEMBRANE THIS HOWEVER HAS HITHERTO BEEN THE SUBJECT OF CONJECTURE ONLY AS WILL BE AMPLY SHOWN BY THE FOLLOWING EXTRACT CONTAINING PERHAPS THE

EXPRESSION THAT IT THE MUCOUS LAMNINA SEPARATES BY SPLITTING FROM THE SEROUS WE THUS GAVE IT AS OUR OPINION THAT THIS PROCESS CONSISTED IN THE SPLITTING OF THE GERMINAL MEMBRANE MORE RECENTLY BAUMGARTNER HAS EXPRESSED DOUBTS OF SUCH AN ORIGIN OF THE MUCOUS LAMINA AND ADVANCED THE OPINION THAT IT BE COMES DEPOSITED UPON THE SEROUS LAMINA BY THE LATTER EXERCISING AN ATTRACTIVE IN FLUENCE UPON THE YELK WHICH DETERMINES SINGLE PARTS OF THE SAME TO ARRANGE THEM SELVES DENSELY ON IT THE SEROUS LAMINA TO FORM A NEW STRUCTURE THE MUCOUS LAMINA THE PROFESSOR AFTER STATING HIS OBJECTIONS TO THIS OPINION OF BAUMGARTNER SAYS THERE ARE ONLY TWO WAYS CONCEIVABLE IN WHICH THE MUCOUS LATNINA CAN ARISE VIZ IT IS EITHER THROWN OFF BY THE SEROUS LAMINA OR ORIGINALLY THERE EXISTS A SINGLE MASS WHICH SPLITS INTO THE SEROUS AND MUCOUS LAMNINAE IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A SOLUTION OF THIS QUESTION HE AGAIN EXAMINED THE OVUM OF THE CRAFISH BUT AS THAT DID NOT SATISFACTORILY FURNISH IT HE CONCLUDES THAT IT WOULD BE ADVISABLE AGAIN TO EXAMNINE THE OVUM OF THE BIRD 195 WE THUS SEE THAT THERE IS STILL GREAT UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE MANNER OF ORIGIN OF THE  MUCOUS LAMINA OF THE SOCALLED  GERMINAL

BY BISCHOFF ON THE OVUM OF THE DOG IN THE FALLOPIAN TUBE AND UTERUS WHICH THOUGH THE PLATES INTENDED TO ILLUSTRATE THEM HAVE NOT YET AP PEARED IT MAY BE PROPER TO NOTICE HERE 278 IT IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE OVA OF THE DOG AND RABBIT SHOULD EVEN AT A VERY EARLY PERIOD BE DISTINGUISHABLE BY PECULIARITIES IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT BUT IT IS DIFFICULT TO ACCOUNT FOR DIFFERENCES SO REMARKABLE AS THOSE WHICH PRESENT THEMSELVES ON COIMPARING THE STATEMENTS OF BISCHOFF WITLH MY OWN THERE ARE ONLY TWO OBSERVA TIONS INDEED IN WHICH WE SEEM TO BE AGREED VIZ THAT THE SPERMATOZOA PENETRATE AS FAR

RECORDED SEVERAL OF THESE HOWEVER RELATE TO POINTS OF CARDINAL IMPORTANCE THUS BISCHOFF MAINTAINS THAT THE OVUM RECEIVES NO NEW EXTERNAL COVERING BUT THAT THE  ZONA PELLUCIDA OF THE OVARIAN OVUM IS IDENTICAL WITH THE CHORION OF THE UTERUS THIS AS ALREADY STATED WAS FORMERLY MY OWN OPINION AND SO NEARLY ARE THE DISAPPEARANCE OF ONE MEMBRANE AND THE COMING INTO VIEW OF ANOTHER MEMBRANE SIMULTANEOUS THAT IT WAS NOT UNTIL NEAR THE CLOSE OF THESE RE SEARCHES THAT I WAS UNDECEIVED PAR 221 BISCHOFF STATES THAT DURING THE PASSAGE OF THE OVUM OF THE DOG THROUGH THE TUBE THE YELK UNDERGOES CHANGES IN ITS FORM BECOMING ANGULAR AND HE MENTIONS CERTAIN GRANULOUS RINGS OF WHAT HE SUPPOSES THE SECOND OR INNER NEMBRANE ALSO THAT IN SOME OVA FROM THE UTERUS HE FOUND THE YELK UNIFORM IN ITS CONSISTENCE AND OPAKE I REFER TO MY OWN FIGURES FOR AN EXPLANATION OF THOSE APPARENT RINGS AND AM COMPELLED TO ADD THAT IN THE OVUMN OF THE RABBIT I LIAVE NOT MET WITH ANY SOLID SUBSTANCE UNIFORM IN

IMPROPER TO REFER TO EXISTING VIEWS RATHER MORE FULLY THAN I HAVE HITHERTO DONE FROM WHICH IT WILL PERHAPS APPEAR THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MANY OF THOSE VIEWS AND THE OPINIONS I HAVE BEEN COMPELLED

TO MIND THE DIVISIONS AND SUBDIVISIONS FIRST OBSERVED BY PREVOST AND DUMAS IN THE OVUM OF BATRACHIAN REPTILES AND SINCE FOUND BY RUSCONI TO OCCUR IN SOME OSSEOUS FISHES SUGGESTING ALSO THAT THESE

THEMSELVES IN SMALLER GLOBULAR MASSES NUCLEI WHICH THEN BECOME SURROUNDED BY A CELL WITH THE GROWTH OF THE CELL THE GRANULES SEPARATE FROM ONE ANOTHER GROUP THEMSELVES IN CONCENTRIC RINGS AND NOW THE NUCLEI BECOME NEW CELLS UNTIL AT LAST EACH YELKGRANULE IS SURROUNDED BY A CELL AND THE GERMINAL MEMBRANE IS SO FORMED AS IN FIGS VII AND VIII WHERE EACH CELL CONTAINS A SIMPLE NUCLEUS IN FIGS IV AND V

THE CITY OF RICHMOND PJNCHUMs ADMX V SOUTHERN RAILWAY COMPANY ET AL March 28 1904 DEATH BY WRONGFUL AcTTo whom damages to be paid Compromise of cluim and distribution of recovery Code sections 2903 2904 and 2905 Where a claim arising out of death due to an alleged wrongful act has been compromised and pursuant to the provisions of section 2905 of the Code application has been made to a circuit court for approval of the compro mise and the parties not agreeing upon the dstribution of the proceeds for an order distributing the same as a jury might direct under section 2903 it is within the discretion of the court whether it will make such direc tion or will refuse so to do allowing the recovery to go according to the statute of distributions In the case at bar Held that the ends of justice will be met by a refusal so to direct Upon a petition of Mary I Holmes administratix of Daniel Pinchum deceased under section 2905 of the Code of Virginia rphe facts appear in the opinion Bryan and Williams for the daughter of the decedent contended that she was the only one of the enumerated kin contemplated by the statute and that accordingly the entire recovery should be awarded herquoting from Richmond Fredericksburg  Poto mac Railroad Company v Martins Admx 9 Virginia Law Regis ter p 893 as follows  It will be observed that by the express language of the statute the damages awarded cannot become assets in the hands of the administrator to be disposed of according to law if the decedent is survived by a wife husband parent or child and the recovery is made free from all debts of the decedent thus leaving no doubt of the legislative intent to treat the recovery as wholly independent of the decedent and his estate in the event of the survival of any one of the enu merated kin and making it inure directly and personally to such next of kin by force of the statute and not derivatively from the decedent to whom it never belonged either in fact or in contemplation of law Robert S Rives and F T Sutton Jr for the grandchild HON R CARTER SCOTT Judge It appears from the record that Daniel Pinchum was during October 1903 employed as fireman on the Southern Railway and that on the 19th of said month while so employed sustained inju1904 PINCHUM V SOUTHERN RY CO 63 ries by reason of the negligence of said companyfromwhich he died that his daughter Mary I Holmes qualified as his administratrix and brought an action against said company in the Circuit Court of Charlotte county that since the institution of said action the administratrix has agreed upon a compromise with the defendant company and as provided by law V C 1887 section 2905 has filed her petition in this court for its approval and its further direction as to the manner of distribution of the proceeds of said compromise It appears further that Mary I Holmes is the only surviving child of Daniel Pinchum but that there is a grandchild now living a son of Archie Pinchum named Daniel Pinchum Jr now about five years old that both of his parents are dead and that Daniel Pinchum Sr his grandfather had supported his said grandchild up to the time of his death It is contended on the part of the petitioner Mlary I Holmes that the whole amount of the compromise viz the sum of 250000 tess expenses and reasonable counsel fees should be directed to be paid to her by operation of the statute as she is the only child whereas on the part of the infant grandchild it is contended that the court should refuse to direct distribution but allow it go according to the statute of distributions It becomesnecessary to determine the meaning of sections 2902 34 and 5 of the Code of 1887 as applied to the facts of this case Sections 2903 and 2904 have been recently amended Acts 1904 C 64 p 110 approved March 7 1904 There is no necessity to go into their history It is admitted that the pro ceeds must be distributed in accordance therewith and that this court has no right to enlarge or narrow their plain meaning Sec tion 2902 provides for the bringing of an action on account of death of a person caused by wrongful act of another Section 2903 provides by whom and within what time it may be brought and further provides that the jury    shall    award such damages    not exceeding ten thousand dollars and iiay direct in what proportion they shall be distributed to the wife husband piarent and child of the deceased   Section 2904 provides The amount    shall   after the payment of costs and reasonable attorneys fees be paid to the wife husband parent and child of the deceased in such pro64 9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER May portion as the jury may have directed or if they have not directed according to the statute of distributions and shall be free from all debts and liabilities of the deceased but if there be no wife husband parent or child the amount so received shall be assets in the hands of the personal representative to be disposed of accord ing to law Section 2905 provides for the compromise of such claims with the approval of the judge or court wherein the action is allowed bv law to be brought and it is therein further provided If the judge approves the compromise and the partiesin interest do not agree upon the distribution to be made of what has been or may be received by the personal representative under the said compro mise or if any of them are incapable of making a valid agree ment the judge may direct such distribution as a jury mright direct under section 2903 as to damages awarded by them In other respects what is received by the personal representative under the compromise shall be treated as if received by him in an action under the section last naimed What power then has a jury to distribute the proceeds of their verdict Whatever power the jury has it must be admitted the judge or court has because the statute so provides section 2905 Section 2904 provides The amount received in any such action shall after payment of costs and reasonable attorneys fees be paid to the wife husband parent and child of the deceased in such proportion as the jury may have directed or if they have not directed according to the statute of distributions and shall be free from all debts and liabilities of the deceased but if there be no wife husband parent or child the amount so received shall be assets in the hands of the personal representative to be disposed of according to law The court is of the opinion that this statute means that upon all the facts presented to a jury it is clothed with legal power to direct that the whole proceeds should go to only one of those named in the statute and to determine which one that should be or else it can divide it between them as the jury deems wisest and best according to the circumstances of the case or it can refuse to direct to whom it should go thinking it best that it should go taccording to the statute of distributions and not as they should direct under the statute The latter part of this section does not1904 PINCHUM V SOUTHERN RY CO 65 take away the power given in the preceding section but only pro vides that if there be no such persons as are named therein the proceeds shall be assets in the hands of the personal representa tive to be disposed of according to law Construing the above statutes in the light of the facts of this case using only the usual courses of construction and taking the words in their ordinary legal signification and meaning it seems clear to my mind that both the jury and the court have the power to refuse to direct how the proceeds shall be paid and having refused to so direct the proceeds to go according to the statute of distributions V C sec 2904 I have carefully examined all the authorities cited in argument and especially R F  P Ry Co v Martiis Admr 9 Va L R p 891 and Powells Admr v Powell 84 Va 415 and have taken the pains to examine the records and briefs in each The first is not in point and the latter which was decided by the present president of the Supreme Court of Appeals while he was circuit judge and on appeal affirmed by President Lewis of the old court is more in point but the facts are not similar to those now under consideration The court is therefore of opinion that uader the facts of this case the ends of justice will be met by its refusing to direct in what proportion the proceeds shall be paid but will leave the law to take its course i e that the proceeds of the compromise shall be paid to the administratrix and go according to the statute of distributions and be free from all debts and liabilities of the deceasedand will enter an order to this effect

THE WHOLE PROCEEDS SHOULD GO TO ONLY ONE OF THOSE NAMED IN THE STATUTE AND TO DETERMINE WHICH ONE THAT SHOULD BE OR ELSE IT CAN DIVIDE IT BETWEEN THEM AS THE JURY DEEMS WISEST AND BEST ACCORDING TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE OR IT CAN REFUSE TO DIRECT TO WHOM IT SHOULD GO THINKING IT BEST THAT IT SHOULD GO TACCORDING TO THE STATUTE OF DISTRIBUTIONS AND NOT AS THEY SHOULD DIRECT UNDER THE STATUTE THE LATTER PART OF THIS SECTION DOES NOT1904 PINCHUM V SOUTHERN RY CO 65 TAKE AWAY THE POWER GIVEN IN THE PRECEDING SECTION BUT ONLY PRO VIDES THAT IF THERE BE NO SUCH PERSONS AS ARE NAMED THEREIN THE PROCEEDS SHALL BE ASSETS IN THE HANDS OF THE PERSONAL REPRESENTA TIVE TO BE DISPOSED OF ACCORDING TO LAW CONSTRUING THE ABOVE STATUTES IN THE LIGHT OF THE FACTS OF THIS CASE USING ONLY THE USUAL COURSES OF CONSTRUCTION AND TAKING THE WORDS IN THEIR ORDINARY LEGAL SIGNIFICATION AND MEANING IT SEEMS CLEAR TO MY MIND THAT BOTH THE JURY AND THE COURT HAVE THE POWER TO REFUSE TO DIRECT HOW THE PROCEEDS SHALL BE PAID AND HAVING REFUSED TO SO DIRECT THE PROCEEDS TO GO ACCORDING TO THE STATUTE OF DISTRIBUTIONS V C SEC 2904 I HAVE CAREFULLY EXAMINED ALL THE AUTHORITIES CITED IN ARGUMENT AND ESPECIALLY R F  P RY CO V MARTIIS ADMR 9 VA L R P 891 AND POWELLS ADMR V POWELL 84 VA 415 AND HAVE TAKEN THE PAINS TO EXAMINE THE RECORDS AND BRIEFS IN EACH THE FIRST IS NOT IN POINT AND THE LATTER WHICH WAS DECIDED BY THE PRESENT PRESIDENT OF THE SUPREME COURT OF APPEALS WHILE HE WAS CIRCUIT JUDGE AND ON APPEAL AFFIRMED BY PRESIDENT LEWIS OF THE OLD COURT IS MORE IN POINT BUT THE FACTS ARE NOT SIMILAR TO THOSE NOW UNDER CONSIDERATION THE COURT IS THEREFORE OF OPINION THAT UADER THE FACTS OF THIS CASE THE ENDS OF JUSTICE WILL BE MET BY ITS REFUSING TO DIRECT IN WHAT PROPORTION THE PROCEEDS SHALL BE PAID BUT WILL LEAVE THE LAW TO TAKE ITS COURSE I E THAT THE PROCEEDS OF THE COMPROMISE SHALL BE PAID TO THE ADMINISTRATRIX AND GO ACCORDING TO THE STATUTE OF DISTRIBUTIONS AND BE FREE FROM ALL DEBTS AND LIABILITIES OF THE DECEASEDAND WILL ENTER AN ORDER TO THIS EFFECT

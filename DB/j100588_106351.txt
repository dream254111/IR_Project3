J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,106351,DESCRIPTION OF A MOST EFFECTUAL METHOD OF SECURING BUILDINGS AGAINST FIRE INVENTED BY CHARLES LORD VISCOUNT MAHON F R S,I206933,884 XL DESCRIPTION OF A MOST EFFECTUAL METHOD OF SECURING BUILDINGS AGAINST FIRE INVENTED BY CHARLES LORD VISCOUNT MAHON F R S READ JULY 2 1778  1 T H E NEW AND VERY SIMPLE METHOD WHICH I HAVE DISCOVERED OF SECURING EVERY KIND OF BUILDING EVEN THOUGH CONSTRUCTED OF TIMBER AGAINST ALL DANGER OF FIRE MAY VERY PROPERLY BE DIVIDED INTO THREE PARTS NAMELY UNDERFLOORING EXTRALATHING AND INTERSECUR ING WHICH PARTICULAR METHODS MAY BE APPLIED IN PART OR IN WHOLE TO DIFFERENT BUILDINGS ACCORDING TO THE VA RIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING THEIR CONSTRUCTION AND ACCORDING TO THE DEGREE OF ACCUMULATED FIRE TO WHICH EACH OF THESE BUILDINGS MAY BE EXPOSED FROM THE DIF FERENT USES TO WHICH THEY ARE MEANT TO BE APPROPRIATED  2 THE METHOD OF UNDERFLOORING MAY BE DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS VIDELICET INTO SINGLE AND DOUBLE UNDER FLOORING THE METHOD OF SINGLE UNDERFLOORING IS AS FOLLOWS A COMMON STRONG LATH OF ABOUT ONE QUARTER OF AN INCH THICK 4 EITHERLORD MAHONS METHOD OF SECURING C 885 EITHER OF OAK OR FIR SHOULD BE NAILED AGAINST EACH SIDE OF EVERY JOIST AND OF EVERY MAIN TIMBER WHICH SUPPORTS THE FLOOR INTENDED TO BE SECURED OTHER SIMILAR LATHS OUGHT THEN TO BE NAILED THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE JOISTS WITH THEIR ENDS BUTTING AGAINST EACH OTHER THESE ARE WHAT I CALL THE FILLETS THE TOP OF EACH FILLET OUGHT TO BE AT ONE INCH AND A HALF BELOW THE TOP OF THE JOISTS OR TIMBERS AGAINST WHICH THEY ARE NAILED THESE FILLETS WILL THEN FORM AS IT WERE A SORT OF SMALL LEDGE ON EACH SIDE OF ALL THE JOISTS  3 WHEN THE FILLETS ARE GOING TO BE NAILED ON SOME OF THE ROUGH PLASTER HEREAFTER MENTIONED  9 MUST BE SPREAD WITH A TROWEL ALL ALONG THAT SIDE OF EACH OF THE FILLETS WHICH IS TO LAY NEXT TO THE JOISTS IN ORDER THAT THESE FILLETS MAY BE WELL BEDDED THEREIN WHEN THEY ARE NAILED ON SO THAT THERE SHOULD NOT BE ANY INTERVAL BE TWEEN THE FILLETS AND THE JOISTS  4 A GREAT NUMBER OF ANY COMMON LATHS EITHER OF OAK OR FIR MUST BE CUT NEARLY TO THE LENGTH OF THE WIDTH OF THE INTERVALS BETWEEN THE JOISTS SOME OF THE ROUGH PLASTER REFERRED TO ABOVE  3 OUGHT TO BE SPREAD WITH A TROWEL SUCCESSIVELY UPON THE TOP OF ALL THE FILLETS AND ALONG THE SIDES OF THAT PART OF THE JOISTS WHICH IS BETWEEN THE TOP OF THE FILLETS AND THE UPPER EDGE OF THE JOISTS THE886 LORD MAHONS METHOD OF THE SHORT PIECES OF COMMON LATHS JUST MENTIONED OUGHT IN ORDER TO FILL UP THE INTERVALS BETWEEN THE JOISTS THAT SUPPORT THE FLOOR TO BE LAID IN THE CONTRARY DIREC TION TO THE JOISTS AND CLOSE TOGETHER IN A ROW SO AS TO TOUCH ONE ANOTHER AS MUCH AS THE WANT OF STRAITNESS IN THE LATHS WILL POSSIBLY ALLOW WITHOUT THE LATHS LAPPING OVER EACH OTHER THEIR ENDS MUST REST UPON THE FILLETS SPOKEN OF ABOVE  2 AND THEY OUGHT TO BE WELL BEDDED IN THE ROUGH PLASTER IT IS NOT PROPER TO USE ANY NAILS TO FASTEN DOWN EITHER THESE SHORT PIECES OF LATHS OR THOSE SHORT PIECES HEREAFTER MENTIONED  7  5 THESE SHORT PIECES OF LATHS OUGHT THEN TO BE CO VERED WITH ONE THICK COAT OF THE ROUGH PLASTER SPOKEN OF HEREAFTER  9 WHICH SHOULD BE SPREAD ALL OVER THEM AND WHICH SHOULD BE BROUGHT WITH A TROWEL TO BE ABOUT LEVEL WITH THE TOPS OF THE JOISTS BUT NOT ABOVE THEM THIS ROUGH PLASTER IN A DAY OR TWO SHOULD BE TROWELLED ALL OVER CLOSE HOME TO THE SIDES OF THE JOISTS BUT THE TOPS OF THE JOISTS OUGHT NOT TO BE ANY WISE COVERED WITH IT  6 THE METHOD OF DOUBLE UNDERFLOORING IS IN THE FIRST PART OF IT EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE METHOD JUST DE SCRIBED THE FILLETS AND THE SHORT PIECES OF LATHS ARE AP PLIED IN THE SAME MANNER BUT THE COAT OF ROUGH PLASTER 3 OUGHTSECURING BUILDINGS AGAINST FIRE 887 OUGHT TO BE LITTLE MORE THAN HALF AS THICK AS THE COAT OF ROUGH PLASTER APPLIED IN THE METHOD OF SINGLE UNDER FLOORING  7 IN THE METHOD OF DOUBLE UNDERFLOORING AS FAST AS THIS COAT OF ROUGH PLASTER IS LAID ON SOME MORE OF THE SHORT PIECES OF LATHS CUT AS ABOVE DIRECTED  4 MUST BE LAID IN THE INTERVALS BETWEEN THE JOISTS UPON THE FIRST COAT OF ROUGH PLASTER AND EACH OF THESE SHORT LATHS MUST BE ONE AFTER THE OTHER BEDDED DEEP AND QUITE SOUND INTO THIS ROUGH PLASTER WHILST IT IS SOFT THESE SHORT PIECES OF LATHS SHOULD BE LAID ALSO AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO EACH OTHER AND IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS THE FIRST LAYER OF SHORT LATHS  8 A COAT OF THE SAME KIND OF ROUGH PLASTER SHOULD THEN BE SPREAD OVER THIS SECOND LAYER OF SHORT LATHS AS THERE WAS UPON THE FIRST LAYER ABOVE DESCRIBED THIS COAT OF ROUGH PLASTER SHOULD AS ABOVEDIRECTED  5 FOR THE METHOD OF SINGLE UNDERFLOORING BE TROWELLED LEVEL WITH THE TOPS OF THE JOISTS BUT IT OUGHT NOT TO RISE ABOVE THEM THE SOONER THIS SECOND COAT OF ROUGH PLASTER IS SPREAD UPON THE SECOND LAYER OF SHORT LATHS JUST MEN TIONED  7 THE BETTER WHAT FOLLOWS AS FAR AS  13 IS COMMON TO THE METHOD OF SINGLE AS WELL AS TO THAT OF DOUBLE UNDERFLOORING  9 COMMON COARSE LIME AND HAIR SUCH AS GENERALLY SERVES FOR THE PRICKINGUPCOAT IN PLASTERING MAY BE USED FOR ALL THE PURPOSES BEFORE OR HEREAFTER MENTIONED BUT888 LORD MAHONS METHOD OF BUT IT IS CONSIDERABLY CHEAPER AND EVEN MUCH BETTER IN ALL THESE CASES TO MAKE USE OF HAY INSTEAD OF HAIR IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE PLASTERWORK FROM CRACKING THE HAY OUGHT TO BE CHOPPED TO ABOUT THREE INCHES IN LENGTH BUT NO SHORTER ONE MEASURE OF COMMON ROUGH SAND TWO MEASURES OF SLACKED LIME AND THREE MEASURES BUT NOT LESS OF CHOPPED HAY WILL PROVE IN GENERAL A VERY GOOD PROPORTION WHEN SUFFICIENTLY BEAT UP TOGETHER IN THE MANNER OF COMMON MORTAR THE HAY MUST BE WELL DRAGGED IN THIS KIND OF ROUGH PLASTER AND WELL INTERMIXED WITH IT BUT THE HAY OUGHT NEVER TO BE PUT IN TILL THE TWO OTHER INGREDIENTS ARE WELL BEAT UP TOGETHER WITH WATER THIS ROUGH PLASTER OUGHT NEVER TO BE MADE THIN FOR ANY OF THE WORK MENTIONED IN THIS PAPER THE STIFFER IT IS THE BETTER PROVIDED IT BE NOT TOO DRY TO BE SPREAD PRO PERLY UPON THE LATHS IF THE FLOORING BOARDS ARE REQUIRED TO BE LAID VERY SOON A FOURTH OR A FIFTH PART OF QUICK A LIME IN POWDER VERYWELL MIXED WITH THIS ROUGH PLASTER JUST BEFORE IT IS USED WILL CAUSE IT TO DRY VERY FAST A I HAVE PRACTICED THIS METHOD IN AN EXTENSIVE WORK WITH GREAT ADVANTAGE IN THREE WEEKS THIS ROUGH PLASTER GROWS PERFECTLY DRY THE ROUGH PLASTER SO MADE MAY BE APPLIED AT ALL TIMES OF THE YEAR WITH THE GREATEST SUCCESS THE EASIEST METHOD BY MUCH OF REDUCING THE QUICK LIME TO POWDER IS BY DROPPING A SMALL QUANTITY OF WATER ON THE LIMESTONE A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE THE POWDER IS INTENDED TO BE USED THE LIME WILL STILL RETAIN A VERY SUFFICIENT DEGREE OF HEAT  10SECURING BUILDINGS AGAINST FIRE 889  10 WHEN THE ROUGH PLASTERWORK BETWEEN THE JOISTS HAS GOT THOROUGHLY DRY IT OUGHT TO BE OBSERVED WHETHER OR NOT THERE BE ANY SMALL CRACKS IN IT PARTICULARLY NEXT TO THE JOISTS IF THERE ARE ANY THEY OUGHT TO BE WASHED OVER WITH A BRUSH WET WITH MORTARWASH WHICH WILL EFFECTUALLY CLOSE THEM BUT THERE WILL NEVER BE ANY CRACKS AT ALL IF THE CHOPPED HAY AND THE QUICK LIME BE PRO PERLY MADE USE OF  11 THE MORTARWASH I MAKE USE OF IS MERELY THIS ABOUT TWO MEASURES OF QUICK LIME AND ONE MEASURE OF COMMON SAND SHOULD BE PUT INTO A PAIL AND SHOULD BE WELL STIRRED UP WITH WATER TILL THE WATER GROWS VERY THICK SO AS TO BE ALMOST OF THE CONSISTENCY OF A THIN JELLY THIS WASH WHEN USED WILL GROW DRY IN A FEW MINUTES  12 BEFORE THE FLOORING BOARDS ARE LAID A SMALL QUANTITY OF VERY DRY COMMON SAND SHOULD BE STREWED OVER THE ROUGH PLASTERWORK BUT NOT OVER THE TOPS OF THE JOISTS THE SAND SHOULD BE STRUCK SMOOTH WITH AN HOLLOW RULE WHICH OUGHT TO BE ABOUT THE LENGTH OF THE DISTANCE FROM JOIST TO JOIST AND OF ABOUT ONE EIGHTH OF AN INCH CURVATURE WHICH RULE PASSING OVER THE SAND IN THE SAME DIRECTION WITH THE JOISTS WILL CAUSE THE SAND TO LAY RATHER ROUNDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE INTERVAL BETWEEN EACH PAIR OF JOISTS THE FLOORING BOARDS MAY THEN BE LAID AND FASTENED DOWN IN THE USUAL MANNER BUT VERY PARTICULAR ATTENTION V O L LXVIII 5 S MUST890 LORD MAHONS METHOD OF MUST BE PAID TO THE ROUGH PLASTERWORK AND TO THE SAND BEING MOST PERFECTLY DRY BEFORE THE BOARDS ARE LAID FOR FEAR OF THE DRYROT OF WHICH HOWEVER THERE IS NO KIND OF DANGER WHEN THIS PRECAUTION IS MADE USE OF  13 THE METHOD OF UNDERFLOORING I HAVE ALSO AP PLIED WITH THE UTMOST SUCCESS TO A WOODEN STAIRCASE IT IS MADE TO FOLLOW THE SHAPE OF THE STEPS BUT NO SAND IS LAID UPON THE ROUGH PLASTERWORK IN THIS CASE  14 THE METHOD OF EXTRALATHING MAY BE APPLIED TO CIELING JOISTS TO SLOPING ROOFS AND TO WOODEN PARTITIONS IT IS SIMPLY THIS AS THE LATHS ARE GOING TO BE NAILED ON SOME OF THE ABOVE MENTIONED ROUGH PLASTER OUGHT TO BE SPREAD BE TWEEN THESE LATHS AND THE JOISTS OR OTHER TIMBERS AGAINST WHICH THESE LATHS ARE TO BE NAILED THE LATHS OUGHT TO BE NAILED VERY CLOSE TO EACH OTHER WHEN EITHER OF THE ENDS OF ANY OF THE LATHS LAPS OVER OTHER LATHS IT OUGHT TO BE ATTENDED TO THAT THESE ENDS BE BEDDED SOUND IN SOME OF THE SAME KIND OF ROUGH PLASTER THIS ATTENTION IS EQUALLY NECESSARY FOR THE SECOND LAYER OF LATHS HEREAFTER MENTIONED  15  15 THIS FIRST LAYER OF LATHS OUGHT TO BE COVERED WITH A PRETTY THICK COAT OF THE SAME ROUGH PLASTER SPOKEN OF ABOVE  9 A SECOND LAYER OF LATHS OUGHT THEN TO BE NAILED ON EACH LATH BEING AS IT IS PUT ON WELL SQUEEZED 4 ANDSECURING BUILDINGS AGAINST FIRE 891 AND BEDDED SOUND INTO THE SOFT ROUGH PLASTER FOR THIS REASON NO MORE OF THIS FIRST COAT OF ROUGH PLASTER OUGHT TO BE LAID ON AT A TIME THAN WHAT CAN BE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED WITH THE SECOND LAYER OF LATHS THE LATHS OF THIS SECOND LAYER OUGHT TO BE LAID AS CLOSE TO EACH OTHER AS THEY CAN BE TO ALLOW OF A PROPER CLENCH FOR THE ROUGH PLASTER THE LATHS OF THE SECOND B LAYER MAY THEN BE PLASTERED OVER WITH A COAT OF THE SAME KIND OF ROUGH PLASTER OR IT MAY BE PLASTERED OVER IN THE USUAL MANNER  16 THE THIRD METHOD WHICH IS THAT OF INTERSECUR ING IS VERY SIMILAR IN MOST RESPECTS TO THAT OF UNDER FLOORING BUT NO SAND IS AFTERWARDS TO BE LAID UPON IT INTERSECURING IS APPLICABLE TO THE SAME PARTS OF A BUILD ING AS THE METHOD OF EXTRAINFERREDLATHINGINFERRED JUST DESCRIBED BUT IT IS NOT OFTEN NECESSARY TO BE MADE USE OF  17 I HAVE MADE A PRODIGIOUS NUMBER OF EXPERI MENTS UPON EVERY PART OF THESE DIFFERENT METHODS I CAUSED A WOODEN BUILDING TO BE CONSTRUCTED AT CHEVENING IN KENT IN ORDER TO PERFORM THEM IN THE MOST NATURAL MANNER THE METHODS OF EXTRALATHING AND DOUBLE UNDERFLOORING WERE THE ONLY ONES MADE USE OF IN THAT BUILDING B IF A THIRD LAYER OF LATHS BE IMMEDIATELY NAILED ON AND BE COVERED WITH A THIRD COAT OF ROUGH PLASTER I THEN CALL THE METHOD TREBLELATHING BUT THIS METHOD OF TREBLELATHING CAN ALMOST IN NO CASE BE REQUIRED 5 S 2 ON892 LORD MAHONS METHOD OF ON THE 26TH OF SEPTEMBER LAST YEAR I HAD THE HONOUR TO REPEAT SOME OF MY EXPERIMENTS BEFORE THE PRESIDENT AND SOME OF THE FELLOWS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY THE LORD MAYOR AND ALDERMEN OF THE CITY OF LONDON THE COM MITTEE OF CITY LANDS SEVERAL OF THE FOREIGN MINISTERS AND A GREAT NUMBER OF OTHER PERSONS  18 THE FIRST EXPERIMENT WAS TO FILL THE LOWER ROOM OF THE BUILDING WHICH ROOM WAS ABOUT TWENTYSIX FEET LONG BY SIXTEEN WIDE FULL OF SHAVINGS AND FAGGOTS MIXED WITH COMBUSTIBLES AND TO SET THEM ALL ON FIRE THE HEAT WAS SO INTENSE THAT THE GLASS OF THE WINDOWS WAS MELTED LIKE SO MUCH COMMON SEALING WAX AND RUN DOWN IN DROPS YET THE FLOORING BOARDS OF THAT VERY ROOM WERE NOT BURNT THROUGH NOR WAS ONE OF THE SIDE TIMBERS FLOORJOISTS OR CIELINGJOISTS DAMAGED IN THE SMALLEST DE GREE AND THE PERSONS WHO WENT INTO THE ROOM IMME DIATELY OVER THE ROOM FILLED WITH FIRE DID NOT PERCEIVE ANY ILL EFFECTS FROM IT WHATEVER EVEN THE FLOOR OF THAT ROOM BEING PERFECTLY COOL DURING THAT ENORMOUS CONFLA GRATION IMMEDIATELY UNDERNEATH  19 I THEN CAUSED A KIND OF WOODEN BUILDING OF FULL FIFTY FEET IN LENGTH AND OF THREE STORIES HIGH IN THE MID DLE TO BE ERECTED QUITE CLOSE TO ONE END OF THE SECURED WOODEN HOUSE I FILLED AND COVERED THIS BUILDING WITH ABOVE ELEVEN HUNDRED LARGE KILN FAGGOTS AND SEVERAL LOADS OF DRY SHAVINGS AND I SET THIS PILE ON FIRE 3 THESECURING BUILDINGS AGAINST FIRE 893 THE HEIGHT OF THE FLAME WAS NO LESS THAN EIGHTYSEVEN FEET PERPENDICULAR FROM THE GROUND AND THE GRASS UPON A BANK AT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET FROM THE FIRE WAS ALL SCORCHED YET THE SECURED WOODEN BUILDING QUITE CONTI GUOUS TO THIS VAST HEAP OF FIRE WAS NOT AT ALL DAMAGED EXCEPT SOME PARTS OF THE OUTER COAT OF PLASTERWORK THIS EXPERIMENT WAS INTENDED TO REPRESENT A WOODEN TOWN ON FIRE AND TO SHEW HOW EFFECTUALLY EVEN A WOODEN BUILDING IF SECURED ACCORDING TO MY NEW METHOD WOULD STOP THE PROGRESS OF THE FLAMES ON THAT SIDE WITHOUT ANY ASSISTANCE FROM FIREENGINES C  20 THE LAST EXPERIMENT I MADE THAT DAY WAS THE AT TEMPTING TO BURN A WOODEN STAIRCASE SECURED ACCORDING TO MY SIMPLE METHOD OF UNDERFLOORING THE UNDER SIDE OF THE STAIRCASE WAS EXTRALATHED SEVERAL VERY LARGE KILN FAGGOTS WERE LAID AND KINDLED UNDER THE STAIRCASE ROUND THE STAIRS AND UPON THE STEPS THIS WOODEN STAIR CASE NOTWITHSTANDING RESISTED AS IF IT HAD BEEN OF FIRE STONE ALL THE ATTEMPTS THAT WERE MADE TO CONSUME IT I HAVE SINCE MADE FIVE OTHER STILL STRONGER FIRES UPON THIS SAME STAIRCASE WITHOUT HAVING REPAIRED IT HAVING MOREOVER FILLED THE SMALL PLACE IN WHICH THIS STAIRCASE IS ENTIRELY WITH SHAVINGS AND LARGE FAGGOTS BUT THE STAIRCASE IS HOWEVER STILL STANDING AND IS BUT LITTLE DAMAGED  21894 LORD MAHONS METHOD OF SECURING C  21 IN MOST HOUSES IT IS NECESSARY ONLY TO SECURE THE FLOORS AND THAT ACCORDING TO THE METHOD OF SINGLE UNDER FLOORING DESCRIBED ABOVE IN  2 3 4 AND 5 THE EXTRAEXPENCE OF IT ALL MATERIALS INCLUDED IS ONLY ABOUT NINE PENCE PER SQUARE YARD UNLESS THERE SHOULD BE PARTI CULAR DIFFICULTIES ATTENDING THE EXECUTION IN WHICH CASE IT WILL VARY A LITTLE WHEN QUICK LIME IS MADE USE OF THE EXPENCE IS A TRIFLE MORE THE EXTRAEXPENCE OF THE METHOD OF EXTRALATHING IS NO MORE THAN SIX PENCE PER SQUARE YARD FOR THE TIMBER SIDEWALLS AND PARTITIONS BUT FOR THE CIELING ABOUT NINE PENCE PER SQUARE YARD NO EXTRALATHING IS NECESSARY IN THE GENERALITY OF HOUSES  22 I PURPOSE GIVING TO THE WORLD BEFORE IT IS VERY LONG A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF MANY OTHER EXPERIMENTS I HAVE MADE UPON THIS SUBJECT AND OF THE VARIOUS ADVAN TAGES ARISING FROM MY METHOD WITH SEVERAL PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF EACH OF THE METHODS ABOVE DESCRIBED AND RELATIVE TO THEIR JOINT OR SEPARATE APPLICATION TO DIFFERENT KINDS OF BUILDINGS AND TO THE DIFFERENT CONSTITUENT PARTS OF AN HOUSE TO WHICH I SHALL ADD A FULL EXPLANATION OF THE PRINCIPLES UPON WHICH THEY ARE FOUNDED AND THE REASONS FOR THEIR CERTAIN AND SUR PRIZING SUCCESS IN THE MEAN TIME I HAVE TAKEN THE LIBERTY OF TROUBLING THE SOCIETY WITH THIS SHORT ACCOUNT

GarrisononHudson N Y THE DIGNITY OF CHEMISTRY CHEMISTRY as a profession may be said to have completed its hundredth year and we have met tonight to celebrate the quarto centennial of chemical organization in America In our democratic country all attempts to create a class or caste should be dis couraged especially if the attempt be made to endow the class with unusual or special privileges We have no place for an he reditary or purchasable aristocracy but in the function of the civic body there must be specialization and those individuals who by choice or fortuitous incident devote themselves to special duties are brought together by occupation by congeniality and by desire for mutual helpfulness and improvement In this mutual attraction we find the genesis of all trade and pro fessional organization The aggregate is always stronger than the segregate This unity of purpose and this conformity of effort become reprehensible only when autocratic imperative and insolent The assumption of superior virtues the asser tion of peculiar privileges and the inter ference with the rights of others are never to be advocated nor condoned  An address delivered before the American Chem ical Society April 12 1901 on the occasion of the cele bration of the 25th anniversary of the founding of the SocietyN S VOL XIII No 332 It is in the instructors manual likewise that the spirit of the authors laboratory meth ods comes more clearly to the foreground The presentation is more intimate the descriptions more comprehensive and the insight into the training which the course is intended to give more manifest The genial set of instructions headed  How to Fail in Laboratory Work might serve a good purpose if prominently exhibited in the laboratory But the main point to be noted is the thorough apprecia tion of the fact that the psychological experi ment carries with it its own conditions and peculiarities that in becoming a subject the individual retains all his peculiarities and that these must be dealt with by tact and resource The difference between good and bad observation upon mental matters depends upon this almost equally with the acquaintance with method and technique Both for the method and the matter these volumes and the two to follow must be valued as amongst the most important of recent contributions to the furtherance of the aims of experimental psy chology JOSEPH JASTROW Peach Leaf Curl Its Nature and Treatment By NEWTON B PIERCE in charge Pacific Coast Laboratory Santa Anna California Bulle tin No 20 Division of Vegetable Physiology and Pathology U S Department of Agri culture Washington Government Printing Office 1900 Pages 1204 plates IXXX A carefully detailed and exhaustive account of the geographical distribution history horti culture botany and pathology of this destruc tive disease and of experiments with the various remedies methods and appliances for treating it The most important of the con clusions is that very large percentages of the injuries due to the parasitic fungus Exoascus deformans are not caused by the renewed growth of perennial mycelium but are the result of new infections occurring in early spring and thus preventable by spraying the still unopened buds with Bordeaux mixture or other fungi cides Previous failures with such treatments are explained by the fact that the remedy was applied after the pathogenic organism had hidden itself in the tissues of its host As the annual losses from leaf curl in the United States are estimated at 3000000 the determination of these simple points is of great economic importance and also of the widest interest since this disease unlike the yellows extends to all regions where the peach is culti vated BOOKS RECEIVED Select Methods of Food

Columbia Univer sity New York City on Saturday April 27 1901 About thirtyfive persons attended the two sessions VicePresident Thomas S Fiske occupied the chair The following persons were elected to membership Mr C W McG Black Yale University Dr S E Slocum University of Cincinnati Two applications for membership were received To relieve the increasing burden of adminis tration the office of Assistant Secretary was created and filled by the appointment of Dr Edward Kasner to serve until February 1902 The library of the Society which at present consists mainly of some five hundred unbound volumes of journals received as exchanges is about to be deposited in the library of Columbia University under an agreement by which the University undertakes to bind catalogue and care for the books now on hand and all future additions and to make them easily accessible to the members of the Society Arrangements will be made by which the books may be tem porarily loaned to members living at a distance The library is to be kept as a separate collec tion duplicating as far as may be the general University library and aiming to become as complete as possible in itself The title to the books remains in the Society which reserves 744 SCIENCE

paleontology and eurator of the geologieal eolleetions in the Peabody Mu seuin of Yale University died very sud denly at his hozne in New Haven on the fourteenth of Pebruary of an affeetion of the heart Up to within an hour of his demise he had appeared in his usual health Dr Beeeher was the son of Moses and EInily EInerson Beeeher born at Dun kirk New York Oetober 9 1856 Efe was prepared for eollege at the high sehool of Warren Pa took the seientifie eourse at the University of Miehigan and was grad uated as BS in 1878 His tastes had led hiin to a study of the native invertebrates living and fossil and after graduation he betaine an assistant to Professor James Hall State Geologist of New York and ineidentally an expert eolleetor and skilled preparator of fossils in whieh the State Museuin is so rieh Efere he remained ten years during whieh he perfeeted hiinself in the seienee of invertebrate paleontology and then through the influenee of Professor Marsh was plaeed in eharge of the eollee tion of invertebrate paleontology at Yale Here he pursued his studies for the doe torate of philosophy whieh he reeeived frozn the university in 1889 his thesis be ing a Ineinoir on a group of Silurian sponges At the instanee of Professor Marsh he spent the suininer of that year eolleeting fossils in Wyoming Subse quently he aeeoznpanied Dr G Baur on a visit to various European Inuseuins He had had the advantage of a eourse in geol ogy under Dana and in 18912 during the illness of that veteran teaeher he eondueted454 SGIENCE NS VoIXIX No481 the elasses in geology In 1892 he was made the assistant proessor of historieal geology in the ShefSeld Seientie Sehool and in 1897 full professor and a member of the governing board Mareh 10 1902 his title was ehanged to that of university professor of paleontology In 1899 he sue eeeded the late Professor Marsh as eurator Of the geologieal eolleetions and beeame a member of the board of trustees of the Peabody Museum At the time of his death he was seeretary to the board and a member of the exeeutive eommittee In 1899 he was eleeted a member of the Na tional Aeademy of Seienees a eorrespond ent of tthe Geologieal Soeiety of Ijondon and a fellow of the Geologieal Soeiety of Ameriea In 1900 he beeame president of the Conneetieut Aeademy of Arts and Se enees and held this offiee until 1902 Professor Beeeher married September 12 1894 Miss Mary S Galligan who with two young daughters survives him The interment was in Grove Street Cemetery New Haven IJike most sueeessful students of organie life Beeeher was a born naturalist As a boy he eolleeted the shells of the region about Warren Pa where his home was situated and his first seientifie paper pub lished in eonjunetion with Mr Walker was a list of the land and freshwater shells found about Ann Arbor Miehigan the seat of the state university The abundanee of Devonian fossils about his home at Warren doubtless eontributed to his early interest in them In 1884 he published his Srst paleontologieal paper an essay on the rare Paleozoie erustaeeans known as phylloeari da a subjeet to whieh he returned eighteen years later in a memoir whieh will be elas sieal Always a field naturalist after his eonneetion with the Sheffield Seientifie Sehool began his opportunities for work in the west beeame more frequent and fruit flll On beeoming eurator of the geclogieal eolleetions he presented to the university his private eolleetion of fossils the result of Inany years of aeeuinulation and of great seientifie value Beeeher was one of those students who derived frozn the teaehings of Hyatt and Cope those guiding prineiples in researeh whieh have proved so fruitful for AIneriean seienee By the applieation of these prin eiples together with a thorough and Ininute knowledge of details he produeed those neinoirs on the Trilobites the Braehiopoda and the origin and signifieanee of spines upon whiek with Inuek other worthy work his reputation in days to eozne will ehiefly rest Spaee fails for an analysis of these eontributions whieh are universally known ainong professional experts Beeeher had the artist s gift and his papers were largely

bare summary of the articles will take more space than this journal can spare All that can be done is to enumerate the papers with such hints of their contents as will con vey some idea o their scope A fine photo gravure of Professor Mark forms the frontis piece then follows the dedication to which allusion has been made and next the papers which make up the volume These have a wide range of subjects but one thing which is striking is the small number of strictly embryological articles such as formed the bulk of the work from his laboratory during the first half of his labors at Harvard Two of the papers deal with habits H R IXinville deals with a couple of tubebuilding annelids describing among other things the manner in which they build their tubes while Jacob Reighard gives a long detailed and interesting account of the habits of Arnta especially durirlg the breeding season and the care of the young Four of the papers describe new species C A Kofoid describes a new protozoan Pro tophrya ovtcola allied to Opaltna found in the food sac of Ltftorsna rudts S Goto gives an account of two new medusse Oltndotdes forrnosa and Gonionerna depressum from Japan pointing out that these genera with Olqwndtas Ealtcalyx and Gontonernotdes form a natural family Olindidse and that the prob lematical freshwater genera Ltrnnocodtum and Ltrnnocntda belong near them Four new species of trematodes three of them from the air passages of snakes and one from the frog form the subject of the paper by H S Pratt while H P Johnson describes three species of polychsete annelids from the fresh waters of the world enumerating in his article twentyfour species of the group known to occur in fresh water The Blorphological articles are more nu merous F H GUerould discusses the develop ment of Sspunculus and Phascalosorna from the beginning of gastrulation to the escape of the larva pointing out that the  serosa  of StpUBCUtbS iS a modification of the prototroch nuity served as an ineentive to his asso eiates who were drawn elosely to him by his enthusiasm and entire laek of egotism There is no doubt that in the death of Professor Beeeher not only has Yale sus tained a serious loss and paleontology a severe blow but the ranks of those eapable of bringing to the study of fossils keen in sight and a philosophieal spirit of enquiry guided by prineiples whose value ean hard ly be exaggerated are diminished by one whom scienee eould ill afford to lose and to whom huinanly speaking there should haveX remained many years of industrious and frllitful researeh W H DALL

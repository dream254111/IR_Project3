j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1011432,The Commission Movement in Missouri,i242621,THE COMMISSION MOVEMENT IN MISSOURI BY JAMES W S PETERS AttorneyatLaw Kansas City Mo There is no city in Missouri under commission rule Even in St Joseph frequently mentioned as a Commission City the council has legislative functions only and as its mayor A P Clayton says St Joseph has not adopted a commission form of government We have merely adopted a new charter The commission rule has not made much headway in St Louis and Kansas City because these cities while having the right to frame their own charters are hampered by constitutional restrictions Kansas City must have a mayor and chief magistrate and two houses of legislation one of which at least shall be elected by general ticket St Louis a chief executive and at least one house of legislation to be elected by general ticket While Missouri is classified as a home rule state this is only partially true Cities in Missouri having populations over I00000 meaning St Louis and Kansas City may formulate their own laws The others are classified under constitutional require ments and by general laws into four divisions determined by population St Joseph is the only first class city No city is now operating as a city of the second class but Springfield and Joplin are eligible to this class when they by popular vote so elect The third class contains about sixty towns including for the present Springfield and Joplin There is no constitutional impediment preventing any of the classified cities from obtaining by general laws the commission form of government including the initiative referendum recall and nonpartisan elections When Kansas City in I905 appointed a board of thirteen freeholders to draft a new charter these freeholders decided that it was impossible without constitutional changes to adopt the commission rule and framed a charter concentrating power in the mayor This charter was defeated but in I908 another charter incorporating its main features was ratified by the people This 839The Annals of the American Academy charter was framed with the cooperation of men prominent as municipal experts such as Clinton Rogers Woodruff F A Cleve land L S Rowe and Elliot H Goodwin and followed more closely than any other existing charter The Municipal Program or Model Charter of the National Municipal League The double house of legislation was retained and the elective officers were limited to the mayor the council the treasurer the comptroller and two judges of the municipal court The adminis trative work was divided into departments and put in charge of bi partisan citizen boards of three members each appointed by the mayor To these boards was left the appointment subject to civil service rules of employees with absolute right of discharge The boards were given large discretion in expenditures and in the manning of their departments The administration work of the city is divided into public works fire and water parks and boule vards and hospital and health each in charge of a board These are supplemented by boards of civil service of public welfare and a public utilities commission None of the members of these boards receives any compensation except those of public works fire and water and the public utilities commission Even these excepted boards receive merely a nominal amount considering the amount of work under their charge None of the board members is required to give his whole time to the city service The people of Kansas City are familiar with these subdivisions of the citys work and know who is responsible for each of the citys activities In this way as in the case of cities under com mission rule conspicuous responsibility is located on these several boards and on the mayor responsible for their appointment The mayor has the right to discharge the board members subject to rein statement by twothirds vote of the upper house of the common council Giving this right of reinstatement to the members of the common council was a concession to the old practice under which the common council had the right to confirm or reject the mayors appointees and is of doubtful expediency From its earliest history Kansas City has pinned its faith to citizen boards Its schools for forty years so managed are among the best Its park and boulevard system embracing 2500 acres of parks and fortyfive miles of boulevards and being an estimated investment of I6oooooo is largely the result of the genius and 840 I70The Commission Movcmcnt in Missouri freely given services of two public spirited citizens A R Meyer and D J Haff Charles W Armour head of the Armour interests in Kansas City has given of his time to the Health and Hospital Department E C Meservey president of the civil service board and excity counselor and John H Thacher a lawyer and ex member of the charter board are inaugurating a new civil service system The civil service commissioners in conducting examina tions have made a new departure extending the Kansas City idea of using its citizen experts to do the citys work They have appointed for each examination three citizens experts in the subject matter involved to frame questions and tests and to grade the papers submitted Since the inception of the work a little over a year ago up to the present time over 125 citizens have thus helped gratuitously and with no expense to the city to select city employees according to merit Under the practical leadership of William Volker acting as a member of the Board of Public Welfare an institution has grown up having supervision of the various correc tional institutions charities and benevolences of the city including a muncipal farm It has recently added to its activities a loan bureau and free legal service department Thus our charter and practice thereunder has given incentive to citizens to take part in working out municipal problems It is a question whether it would not be a loss if this opportunity of service were taken away by commission rule concentrating the citys power and authority in five experts Iow far the commission rule would affect municipal institutions existing under present legal adjudi cations and the status of public improvements based on existing decisions of courts must also be considered The commission rule is still in an experimental state and as applied to large cities is based not on experience but on a priori reasoning At the present time it would be to the ultimate advantage of municipal government if all the various new forms including the Kansas City Citizen Board System were thoroughly tried out Mayor Darius A Brown of Kansas City who is also president of the League of American Municipalities has inaugurated an institution having advantages of the commission rule in bringing together for consultation men prominently connected with the citys departments Every Monday this Mayors Cabinet meets for two hours discussion of civic matters and serves as a clearing 841 I71The Annals of the American Academy house for the various municipal energies The members are prominent city officials and one representative from each of sixteen of the leading commercial professional and industrial organizations of the city The city officials represented are the city counselor comptroller treasurer auditor engineer chief of police municipal librarian president of the upper house speaker of the lower house and the presidents of the municipal boards On March 3I I9II Dr C A Jackson a member of the lower house of the common council of Kansas City introduced a reso lution providing for the appointment of a joint committee of the two houses of the council to investigate the commission form of government and report its findings by June 29th The ordinance appropriated 4000 for the expense of the investigation It was reported unfavorably This ordinance caused discussion F F Rozzelle an excity counselor in an interview suggested that there was no constitutional restriction to decreasing the number of the council and designating a member of the council to be cx officio in charge of a specific administration bureau nor to incorporating the safeguards of the initiative referendum and recall thus accom plishing in effect the commission rule He called attention to the fact that in the charter of I889 the president of the upper house was also elected as the president of the Board of Public Works If the city desired it could by charter amendment reduce the number of wards or abolish them altogether On April 17 E C Meservey suggested at the mayors cabinet meeting a plan of amending the present city charter so as to have a modified form of commission rule without any con stitutional changes He suggested the abolition of ward lines and provision for a small group of officers elected at large combining legislative and administrative functions each councilman of both upper and lower houses to have administrative charge of a city department and give his whole time to the city also to incor porate for safeguard and protection the initiative referendum and recall In a later interview Mr Meservey leaned to the view that the parks and the civil service and possibly some other depart ments might be managed by appointive boards No official action has ever been taken on these suggestions Although these two excity counselors one a republican the other a democrat thus seem to advocate or at least approve the 842 I72The Commission Movement in Missouri commission rule there is a strong tendency throughout the state to adhere to old forms On the other hand Governor H S Hadley a republican in a recommendation to the legislature last January suggested the passage of a measure for commission rule for the smaller cities and exGovernor Joseph W Folk democrat says I favor the com mission plan of city government for the reason that a municipal corporation is a business concern and its government should be modeled after that of the ordinary corporation rather than after the sovereign governments of the state and nation This is a sim plified form of government and the simpler government can be made the more government by the people there will be Mayor Darius A Brown expresses the prevailing sentiment in Kansas City and St Louis and the true principle of charter mak ing He says I do not believe that any particular form of gov ernment adopted by some other city should be taken up bodily and an attempt made to apply it to the conditions existing in Kansas City However I believe it is the duty of those connected with the government of Kansas City taking the present charter and form of government as a basis to adopt every change in the method of transacting business which has proven successful in the experience of other communities On January 3Ist I9II St Louis at a special charter election refused to adopt a charter prepared by a board of thirteen free holders after two years study The chairman of this board was Fred H Lehmann now Solicitor General of the United States The board was of the opinion that while St Louis could not adopt a commission form of government a charter might be drawn up having some of its best features They provided for one house of legislation of fifteen members elected at large instead of the pres ent bicameral council The comptroller was given a seat in the council with right to debate matters pertaining to his department but without right to vote With exception of a few elective officers the charter concentrated the appointing power in the mayor with right of removal by him without trial and left to the responsible heads of departments and boards the power of appointing and removing their subordinates subject to civil service rules This charter provided for a board of public improvements of five mem bers at least three to have technical training and experience 843 I73The Annals of the American Academy appointed by the mayor and gave them control of all public works parks boulevards and playgrounds also it allowed them to serve as a public utilities commission The members were to have sala ries of at least 8ooo each It was a loss to experimentation in city administration that the defeat of the St Louis charter prevented this from being tried out This plan showed the influence of the commission idea in giving five men such conspicuous and responsible functions on salaries sufficient to attract experts This St Louis charter provided for the recall of elected city officers on a 25 per cent basis but only at the biennial November elections and for referendum of franchises on a 15 per cent petition and no initiative It also had a novelty in franchise legislation by providing a means whereby municipal ownership if deemed advisable by the people might be made practically possible by providing that the city should have the right to issue bonds solely upon the credit of the income derived from and the property used in connection with any public utility owned or operated by the city It was largely due to dissat isfaction with the limitations on the recall and the absence of the initiative combined with opposition to the civil service provision and to the abolishment of ward representation that the charter suffered defeat Dwight F Davis a member of the Executive Committee of the National Municipal League anid vicechairman of the defeated St Louis charter comparing it with commission rule charters makes this analysis Is it not possible to obtain the undoubted advantages of the commission plan without the dangers incident thereto The main inherent advantages are simplicity administra tive efficiency and the short ballot Other features of the later commission charters such as the initiative referendum and recall are adaptable to any system and therefore are not arguments either for or against the commission plan itself In the proposed charter for St Louis defeated recently it was hoped to secure the inherent advantages mentioned above by the election of a mini mum number of officials and by giving practically all the important administrative duties to a small body of six men except cer tain welldefined special departments such as the Police and Fire Departments A small legislative body was proposed with absolute control over the public purse whose duties were confined to the determination of matters of policy The Board of Freeholders 844 174The Commission Movement in Missouri believed that by securing in this way a simple and efficient govern ment with a comparatively short ballot most of the advantages of the commission form would have been obtained without its danger I believe that the evolution from our present system along these lines would be wiser than the revolution involved in the adoption of the commission plan In 1908 St Joseph then operating under the law applicable to cities of the second class determined to get a charter passed appli cable to cities of the first class and suited to its needs A committee was appointed to accomplish this The committee over twenty in number consisted of three members of the council certain city officials and citizens selected by the citys commercial organizations A charter framed by this committee in I909 was enacted by the legislature and adopted by St Joseph at a special election Septem ber 7th I909 Instead of nine aldermen one from each ward it provided for the election at large of five All legislative powers were vested in the council subject to the mayors veto The execu tive functions were vested in the mayor and other officers elected by the people This charter incorporated the initiative referendum and recall the elective officers were cut down in number to the mayor and five aldermen the judge of police court auditor and treasurer The other officers including a number of citizen boards are appointed by the mayor The charter incorporated the Omaha Viaduct Law the Kansas City Park Law and copying the New York utilities provisions assured itself of ample powers to regulate public utilities Although the committee framing this St Joseph charter were inclined to the commission rule still their work showed a tendency to adhere to old charter provisions and those of other cities tested by experienceespecially in the matter of public im provements Joplin has always claimed to be the first city in Missouri to advocate commission rule in city government and in I907 had without success submitted to the legislature a charter on those lines framed by a citizens committee under leadership of Judge O H Picher So that in I909 when St Joseph as a city of the first class succeeded in securing a new charter having some features of the commission rule Joplin began an active campaign for a general law providing the commission rule for cities of the second class to which it and Springfield then were the only eligibles The present 845 I75The Annals of the American Academy form of charter for cities of the third class was good enough for Joplin when a mining town of 5000 but had become inadequate for a city of 35000 population demanding larger expenditures and more liberal provisions for public improvements Remembering the defeat of I907 the leaders recognized that active work was necessary The Commercial Club of Joplin ap pointed a committee of about twenty three from the council and three each from the Joplin Commercial Club Joplin Trades Assem bly and the Bar Association and also representatives from the South Joplin Business Mens Club and the Retail Merchants Asso ciation Other men well known for their ability who had been connected with the framing of the charter defeated two years before were added This general committee with Hon Hugh McIndoe former state senator as chairman appointed a subcommittee to draft a form of charter on the commission rule plan The members of this subcommittee were Haywood Scott chairman Douglass E McDowell P D Decker Bert W Lyon George J Graystone and Thomas J Sheridan Springfield was asked to cooperate and a resolution was passed by the council of that city authorizing the mayor to request the Commercial Club the Springfield Club the Trades Union and the Central Trades and Labor Assembly and the Bar Association each to appoint three This committee though appointed some time before that date did not meet until December I9I0 when the newlyelected mayor Robert F Lee called a meeting and on December 22 I9I0 the committee at a conference with the Joplin committee adopted the Joplin plan already prepared Seven teen of the men who drafted the bill were democrats twelve were republicans and three were socialists After the charter was completed Mayors Guy Humes of Joplin and Robert F Lee of Springfield of opposite political parties accompanied by twentyfive representative citizens of the two cities took the bill to Jefferson City Those appearing in its behalf included professional and business men and representatives of the various civic and labor organizations A request was made of the representatives of the two counties to introduce the measure in the legislature and early in January the bill was introduced into the senate by Senator Kirk Hawkins of Springfield and Senator J F Dunwoody of Joplin and in the house by Representatives McLain Jones of Springfield and Charles W Fear of Joplin It was 846 I76The Commission Movement in Missouri referred to the house committee on municipal legislation of which F H Farris was chairman and the same committee of the senate of which M E Casey of Kansas City was chairman but was never reported out While the bill was pending petitions from Joplin and Springfield having long lists of signatures were filed both for and against the bill Both sides claimed that the interests were against them The chief opponent of the bill was Mr Gilbert Barbee of Joplin influential locally in politics and formerly owner of the Joplin Globe and for years political dictator of the town who succeeded in persuading politicians that this was the breach that meant the ultimate overthrow of party organization Ie summoned to his aid men from all over the state upon whom he had conferred political help and although no cities except Springfield and Joplin were affected encompassed the defeat of the bill From some source the report was sent abroad among the legislators that it was a political move to give the republican party an advantage a strong argument with a democratic majority T K Bowmen of Springfield gives as reasons for the defeat of the bill One of the chief objections was the provision to nominate and elect councilmenatlarge Another objection was that each member should be elected for a specific department Both parties in their last municipal campaign in Joplin endorsed the commission rule The JoplinSpringfield proposed charter was an uptodate com mission charter providing for a mayor and four councilmen elected at large and well paid and incorporated the initiative referendum and recall nonpartisan elections and civil service for minor em ployees Any citizen might pay IO and file with the city clerk a statement of his candidacy for the council including a declaration of principles not exceeding 300 words to be printed at the citys expense and mailed to the registered voters Each member of the council had the right to appoint all officers and employees in the department under his supervision and to remove them at will At the same time that Joplin and Springfield were arousing sentiment for commission rule in their communities the smaller cities a large number of which were associated in the League of Missouri Municipalities were working to the same end for them selves This organization having over thirtyfive Missouri towns on its membership had appointed a committee consisting of E C 847 I77The Annals of the American Academy Yeater of Sedalia Dr Isadore Loeb of Columbia Lee T Mont gomery of Sedalia and L E Bates of Webb City to prepare the bill When the bill was presented in the legislature by Samuel H Pickler of Adair county on January 27 I9II it was accompanied by a statement of the League of Missouri Municipalities giving arguments for its favorable consideration The bill while embrac ing in its terms cities from 3000 to Iooooo population and covering cities of the second and third classes was not intended in any way to interfere with the Joplin and Springfield bill but was a modifica tion of that act for smaller cities The bill provided that twentyfive per cent of the voters of the municipalities affected might petition for a special election to vote for the adoption of the proposed system A board consisting of two three or four councilmen according to the size of the city and a mayor elected at large was to manage the several city departments and to select the subordinate officers and employees necessary for the citys business All franchises were to be submitted to popular vote The initiative referendum and recall were provided for This bill was referred to the municipal legislation committee and never reported Aroused by the discussion of these two bills the state senate appointed a committee consisting of Senators George W Humphrey Francis M Wilson Thomas F Lane Josiah W Peck and J F Dunwoody to visit cities operating under commission government and report its findings with recommendations to the next general assembly in I913 This committee expected to make a study of commission ruled cities this fall and winter and to make an exhaus tive report in I913 but only recently E W Majors prominently spoken of as the next democratic nominee for governor and now attorney general of the state has rendered an opinion denying authority of one house of the legislature to incur expenses for this purpose and also the right of such committee to act in vacation It is probable that the next legislature in 19I3 will enact a law giving to the smaller cities the option of adopting the commission ruleand it is certain that Joplin and Springfield will renew their fight for commission rule for cities of the second class at that time The larger cities in their enthusiasm to adopt the new idea should at the same time take care to hold fast to that which is good in charters drawn with labor and care for their needs There is a value in citizen service rendered without pay by men of brains 848 178The Commission Movement in Missouri and wealth who could not afford to give their whole time to city service In the argument for commission rule as being merely the adaptation of business methods to municipal administration the fact should not be ignored that in business organizations directors of the companies with the exception of an occasional officer are not the experts who do the business but are men who successful in other lines in protecting their own interests serve as directors without pay appointing and supervising experts and determining policies 849 I79

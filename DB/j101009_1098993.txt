j101009,The Virginia Law Register,1098993,Fraud When Means of Knowledge Are at Hand and Equally Available to Seller and Buyer,i245814,1895 FOR THE JUNIORS 305 owners of No 11 and that Bumgardner to whom No 11 had been conveyed was the exclusive owner of the iron ore under No 6 in feesimple and so dissolved the injunction And in the Court of Appeals the decision of the Circuit Court was affirmed as to the nature of the mineral right reserved by the trustees on the sale of No 6 to Lillythat it was exclusive and unlimited and therefore amounted to a corporeal hereditament but it was held that being corporeal it did not pass to Bumgardner by the deed to him of that part of No 11 and so the title to the minerals at the institution of the suit was still in the trustees Hence at that time Bumgardner was a trespasser upon the rights of Lee not because Lee was the owner of the ore bank which had been reserved on the grant to Lilly of No 6 but because Bumgardner not having title to the ore bank had no right to trespass op No 6 the surface of which belonged to Lee and that being a mere stranger he could not justify his invasion of the soil of another by the outstanding rights of the original vendors the trustees But after suit was brought Bumgardner perfected his title by obtaining a conveyance of the ore banks under No 6 from the surviving trustee one of the vendors of No 6 and it was held that while this title was procured after suit was brought yet having been obtained without interference with the rights of Lee it constituted a valid defence to his complaint against Bumgardner so far as digging the ore was concerned FRAUD WHEN MEANS OF KNOWLEDGE ARE AT HAND AND EQUALLY AVAIL ABLE TO SELLER AND BUYERUnder these circumstances it is said in the recent case of Lake v Tyree 90 Va 719 that the buyer has no remedy by reason of the sellers false representations but must abide the consequences of his own folly or carelessness But this doctrine was not necessary to the decision of the case as in the Court of Appeals the only statements by the seller that could be considered were of opinion not fact and on this ground the buyer was without remedy The doctrine however is laid down in a number of American cases see note to Spitze v Baltimore etc R Co 32 Am St R 384 but there are authorities to the con trary and it should receive further consideration befor it is accepted as the law of Virginia In Long z Warren 68 N Y 426 cited in Lake v Tyree three of the seven judges dissented and in Cottrill v Krum 100 Mo 397 S C 18 Am St Rep 549 the doctrine was examined and rejected In Pollock on Torts 3d ed 377 the English rule is thus laid down Yet another case is that the plaintiff has at hand the means of testing the defendants statement indicated by the defendant himself or otherwise within the plaintiffs power and either does not use them or uses them in a partial and imperfect man ner Here it seems plausible at first sight to contend that a man who does not use obvious means of verifying the representations made to him does not deserve to be compensated for any loss he may incur by relying on them without inquiry But the ground of this kind of redress is not the merit of the plaintiff but the demerit of the defendant and it is now settled law that one who chooses to make positive assertions without warrant shall not excuse himself by saying that the other party need not have relied upon them He must show that his representa tions were not in fact relied on And in Bigelow on Torts Law Students Series 4th ed p 39 it is said It has sometimes been laid down that if the means of knowledge be equally open to both parties the plaintiff as a prudent man306 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER August must be deemed to have availed himself of such means or is not to be excused if he has not done so and hence that in contemplation of law he has not been deceived by the defendants misrepresentation the result being that unless there was a warranty no action can be maintained    Some courts however have come to draw a distinction between means of knowledge at hand and general means of knowledge in the case of misrepresentations enforcing the doctrine in question when the means are at hand and only in such cases    Even this doctrine can hardly be considered acceptable generally in the light of most of the recent authorities as distinguished from the mere dicta of the books It may be hard to believe that the plaintiff did not avail himself of means of knowl edge directly at hand but there is in principle and on authority only a proba bility of fact to be overcome even in such a case There is by the better rule no conclusion of law either that the plaintiff availed himself of the means or that it was his duty to do so the plaintiff may still show that he was misled by the defendants representations And see to the same effect Kerr on Fraud p 80 Bigelow on Fraud 5228 quoted in Cottrill v Krum supra In the analogous case of obtaining goods by false pretences it was once thought that if the person from whom the goods were obtained was negligent or failed in ordinary prudence the crime was not committed But the tendency of the more recent authorities is to establish the rule that whatever the pretence if it was intended to defraud and actually did defraud the offence is committed Mays Crim Law sec 113 Bowen v State 9 Baxter Tenn 45 S C 40 Am Rep 71 and extended note Barton v People 135 Ill 405 S C 25 Am St Rep 375 and note at p 382 DEMURRER TO A PLEAIt is the practice in Virginia when the plaintiff de murs to the defendants plea and the demurrer is overruled to permit the plaintiff to withdraw the demurrer and reply to the plea by a traverse or by way of con fession and avoidance 4 Min Ins 3d ed 1167 1 Bart Law Prac 2d ed 455 4612 But it is hazardous for the plaintiff to demur to a plea since if his demurrer is overruled and he then obtains leave to withdraw it and traverses the plea or replies by way of confession and avoidance he is considered to waive his demurrer and cannot object to the legal sufficiency of the plea in the appel late court The proper course for the plaintiff is instead of demurring to object to the reception of the plea and move to reject it and if his motion is over ruled he may except to the opinion of the court and make his exception a part of the record by a bill of exceptions and then reply to the plea in point of fact In this way there is no waiver and the plaintiff saves to himself in the appellate court the benefit of his objection to the plea

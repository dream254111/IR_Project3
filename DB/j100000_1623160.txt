of this journal p 197 is eminently fair in spirit it is incomplete and therefore I fear it will be misleading It is a mistake to say that my work on the perturbations of 70 Ophiuchi is supported by the American observations but contradicted by those made at the same time in Europe On the contrary the deviation from Schurs orbit and the work of the American ob servers is confirmed by the measures of all the best observers abroad Thus the deviation ap pears unmistakably in the observations of Bigourdan Callandreau Schiaparelli Glase napp and Knorre Since publishing the paper in American Journal 363 measures have been received from several of the above observers and there is absolutely no doubt of the substan tial accuracy of the American observations Among the European observers Schur and Ebell a student at Berlin alone find no devia tion but Schurs measures are very discordant and he admits A N 3324 that they are of little value while Ebells measures show dis crepancies on the several nights amounting to over ten degrees in angle Hence it is evident that all the best observa tions both American and European confirm the deviation from Schurs orbit and point to the existence of the dark body as the cause of this unexpected phenomenon My researches on the orbits of 40 binary stars which are now practically complete will probably remove all doubt as to the propriety of using the distances in such investigations Indeed the discovery of the perturbations in 70 Ophiuchi by using both angles and distances after Schur had con N S VOL III No 60 sciously rejected the distances which would have given him the discovery is a striking illustra tion of the evil of orthodoxy in scientific pro cedure T J J SEE THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO February 11 1896 PSYCHOLOGY OF NUMBER To THE EDITOR OF SCIENCESir As Prof Fine in his review of McLellans and Deweys Psychology of Number January 24 1896 raised a question of considerable importance to educators and to psychologists permit me to add a few words to the discussion first thank ing the reviewer for the generally appreciative tone of his article 1 The question of principle raised is whether or no counting is measuring whether or no integral number has a metric origin or purpose and involves the idea of ratio Now measure ment is a word both of a more general and a more technical sense That in the most tech nical mathematical sense counting is not measurement is clearly recognized in the book referred to But as it is held that in the larger sense of the term it is a process of measuring and that the technical mode of measurement is an outgrowth psychologically of the broader and looser sense this disclaimer amounts per haps to little Starting from the larger sense it is held that number has its psychological genesis in the felt need for valuation and that its function psychologically once more is to serve the pur poses of valuation Now counting seems to me indubitably one mode of defining the value of a previously unvalued mental whole and in that sense to be a mode of measure ment Any process of defining value is I should say a form of measurement in the broad sense of that term Counting implies first a mental whole secondly the breaking up of that whole into distinct parts third the use of one any one not some one of these parts as a unit fourth the measurement of the amount or value of the original whole through equal izing it to a certain definite number of the selected unit But Prof Fine says  In however loose a sense the word may be used measuring at least involves the conscious use of a unit of refSCIaER erence But no one ever did or ever will count a group of horses for instance by first conceiv ing of an artificial  unit horse and then match ing it with each actual horse in turnwhich measuring the group of horses must mean if it means anything The whole point here is under what circum stances does one not a mathematician or for mathematical purposes count a group of horses The answer is something of the following sort it seems to me One counts when one wishes to find out how many horses he has caught in a days hunt whether the same number has been driven back at night that were taken out in the morning how much money is to be got in sell ing them it having been settled that each horse is to fetch the same sum etc etc how one ranks as a chieftain or a soldier compared with others etc etc In other words one not having arrived at the abstract interest of the mathematician and certainly the child to be educated has not counts only when there is some value to be as certained and counts by setting off something which for present purposes is a sample unit of value e g a horse then equating the total value to the number of such units Takingthe matter in its development then and not at the stage of the mathematician when abstracts have already become concretes enumeration is al ways to define value i e to measure If the book referred to did not recognize the distinction between this sort of measuring and the technical sort it should certainly be con demned But one of the points emphasized is that the former is an imperfect sort of measure ment that we dont really know e g what the possession of 60 horses amounts to till we know what one horse is worth and so measur ing proper measuring with measured units is substituted for mere counting i e measuring with undefined units of value 2 It is said that number is not ratio If one  Whence and wherefore this artificial  The point to be proved involves nothing about an artificial unit but only a unit of reference and that surely a horse is But even if the term were relevant in the argument the question would arise whether the use of an artificial unit or of a measured unit is the es sence of technical measurement whether indeed a foot is psychologically more artificialthan ahorse 287 is using ratio to denote a certain idea and not a technical abstraction of the mathematicians I do not see how this statement is to be reconciled with Prof Fines own account of enumeration To count a group of things on the fingers is merely by assigning one of the fingers to each one of the things to form a group of fingers which stand in a relation of onetoone corro spondence to the group of things   And again When we say of two groups of things that they are equal numerically we simply mean that for each in the second there is one in the first and for each thing in the first there is o0e in the second in other words that the groups may be brought into a relation of onetoone cor respondence What does the phrase italicized mean save the idea of ratio If this way of stating it had only been known to me when the book reviewed was written I should gladly have utilized it to indicate precisely the point we were trying to makethe implicit presence of the ratio idea in every number Psychologically there is of course a difFer ence in the mental attitude in recognizing a thing as one as unity as a whole an indi vidual and recognizing it as  a one a unit The primary problem the educator has to face if he is to rationalize the teaching of arithmetic is the discovery of this difference The answer given is that one qualitative individuality or unity becomes  a one a unit when it is used to measure value and that in turn the need for this use arises when the thing is no longer taken as an adequate end but as a means to be adjusted to some further end E g once more when a man is wholly occupied in riding or hunting or feeding a horse when that absorbs his whole interest he never takes the numerical view when he wants to know how much of a horse owner he is and how fir this horse contributes to that end he necew sarily takes it The question then is whether one  ever becomes a one save as it is putL into a  relation of onetoone correspondence  3 Prof Fine remarks that the one postulate of arithmetic is that distinct things exist The mathematician may perhaps be reminded that this postulate is precisely one of the chief prob lems of the psychologist Given a certainnum  Italics mine FJBBRUAiRY 21 18961288 SCIENCE ber of things already recognized as distinct and it is a very simple matter to go ahead and enu merate them though even that must have a psy chology motivation But the whole tendency of contemporary psychology is to take a psy chical continuum as its datum and find dis tinctness the property at the basis of number as the outcome of a process of differentiation The identification of this process the ascertain ing of the circumstances under which it arises the mode of its operationthis is the thing which the psychologist wants to know about number and is the thing the educator must know to secure the conditions under which the child shall form the number concepts easily and efficiently The theory of the book Psychology of Number viz that the differentiation and enumeration of units arises through the progressively ac curate adjustment of means to end may be right or wrong but its error can hardly be established I take itby a mathematical view which considers number only as it is after it is fully developed and has become so familiar as to be itself a complete object to the mind Without pretend ing to a knowledge of numerical theory which I do not possess I may say that it seems to me that the work done by Gauss is at precisely the opposite pole from that which the educator needs from the psychologist i e Gauss was attempting to reduce to its ultimate simple nu merical generalizations the developed mathe matical structure Dr McLellan and myself were engaged upon the much humbler task of finding out what sort of a mental condition creates a demand for number and how it is that number operates to satisfy that demand May I conclude by referring to the prac tical point involved The trained mathema tician as such is of necessity interested in the further use of certain finished psychical pro ducts As a mathematician any reference to the preliminary development of these products can only disturb and divert him But the problem for the pupil is how to get the stand point of the mathematician not how to use certain tools but how to make them not how to carry further the manipulation of certain data but how to get meaning into the data This is ultimately a psychological question not a mathematical one although it has to N S VOL III No 60 be translated over into mathematical terms and processes and none is so well fitted to do it as the mathematician provided only he will pro ject himself far enough backward in the scale of development to realize the problem The point does not conclude with primary instruction Our textbooks of algebra geometry and high analysis are almost entirely written from the standpoint of an elegant and logical exposition of the matter as it stands to the trained mathe matician They are very nice for one who doesnt need them any longer The first books written from the standpoint of one who is still coming to consciousness of the meaning of his concepts will perhaps seem foolishness to the trained mathematician but they will mark the dawn of a new day to the average student I venture the statement that putting aside the few with the inborn mathematical instinct higher and secondary mathematics is to the majority of students a practical riddle with no definite intellectual content in itself What meaning it possesses it has got by way of at tained practical facility in solving problems or through its applications to other sciences or to engineering It will hardly be denied that the educational value of mathematics is not realized until its concepts and methods have a definite intellectual meaning and content of their own Can this be secured save as the methods of in struction follow the evolution of the process out of its cruder psychical forms to the more finished I shall be more than satisfied to have made many blunders on the mathematical side if only I do not offer myself up in vain as a spec tacle if only more competent psychologists take up the matter and if only mathematicians may descend from their acquired mathemat ical plane and endeavor to rethink the psy chical conditions and steps through which their present magnificent apparatus has grown out of primitive nonmathematical or crudely mathematical forms up to its present high es tate If the psychologist will risk some blun dering around among the mathematical con cepts and the mathematician will recognize the relevancy of the psychological demand and venture a little blundering upon that side both parties may not only come to an understanding but mathematical teaching may get what it toSCIENCE day so largely lacks some relationship to the psychical needs and attitudes of those under in struction JOHN DEWEY UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO February 6 1896 DOES THE PRIVATE COLLECTOR MAKE THE BEST MUSEUM ADMINISTRATOR THE concluding portion section K of Dr Goodes recent paper on the Classification of Museums is devoted to a consideration of private cabinets and collectors and to the major portion of the propositions therein laid down all can heartily subscribe There is however one among them to which I can not fully assent at least so far as museums of natural history are concerned and that is that The person who has formed a private collection can most suc cessfully manage one for the use of the public It must be confessed that this doubt largely rests upon theory but an acquaintance with some collectors makes it seem probable that it is after all well founded A considerable amount of collecting is done with no purpose in view other than that of ac cumulating specimens but on the other hand a private collection may be formed with a definite purpose and along certain lines In the one case the collector certainly shows no unusual fitness for a position in a museum while in the other he is interested in his collection for what he can get out of it himself and not for the benefit it may be to others and this is exactly the opposite view to that which should be held by an officer in a public museum This is not saying that such is the point of view universally assumed by museum curators but it is certain that the success of a public museum depends on the extent to which it is adopted Again a private collector is from the nature of the case apt to be onesided to lay too much stress on one group to the exclusion of others and thus to lack the evenness of balance which should be one of the characteristics of the museum man This onesidedness frequently takes the form of undue preference for rare or costly specimens attaching an undue importance to the specimens themselves rather than what is to be got out of them Moreover the care and arrangement of a pri vate study series and of a public study series 289 and above all of an exhibition series are en tirely different things and require a totally dif ferent treatment A private series may be ill arranged and poorly labeled but the owner knows each specimen its history and where abouts A public study series should on the contrary be so arranged and so labeled that any student may consult it and make notes upon it while in an exhibition series the specimens should be so chosen that while each conveys some information all form a harmonious whole A private collector may know his own needs but he would not know or would not care for the needs of the public and he would carry to a public museum the taste for accumulation or for research which probably led to the forma tion of his own collection Accumulation is a good thing but it needs to be properly directed in order to be of public service while there is probably no greater drawback to the public efficiency of a museum officer than too great devotion to original research as this leads not only to lack of care for material which has served its turn but to a very decided lack of interest in the public which must be reached through the exhibition series This criticism is by no means to be construed into a criticism of the private collector the value of his work and the influence of his col lections are immense it is simply a denial of the proposition that because a man has formed a private cabinet he is therefore best fitted to ad minister a public museum F A LUCAS WASHINGTON D C SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE Lehrbuch

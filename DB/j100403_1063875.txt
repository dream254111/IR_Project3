INSURERThe defendant insured with the plaintiff company certain mortgaged property against loss by fire the policy being payable to the mortgagee as his interest might appear The property was destroyed within the terms of the policy and having paid the mortgagee the plaintiff claims subrogation to his rights against the mortgagor Held the insurer is not entitled to subrogation Milwaukee Ins Co v Ramsey Ore 149 Pac 542 A fire insurance contract is strictly a contract of indemnity Hedger v Union Ins Co 17 Fed 498 Chickasaw County Ins Co v Weller 98 Ia 731 68 N W 443 And therefore while the insured should be fully indemnified within the limits of the policy he should never be allowed to profit by the loss Chickasaw County Ins Co v Weller supra It is on this theory that the insurer is by the great weight of authority subrogated to the mortgagees rights against the mortgagor when the former insures hbis own interests separately otherwise the insured mortgagee could collect his debts twiceboth from the insurer and from the mortgagor Thoirnton v Enterprise Ins Co 71 Pa St 234 Ulster Co Savings Inst v Leake 73 N Y 161 29 Am Rep 115 Sussex Co Mut InsCo v Woodruff 26 N J L 541 Where as in the principal case the mortgagor procures the insur ance at his own expense designating the mortgagee as beneficiary the authorities unanimously agree that the insurer is not entitled to sub rogation but that the amount paid the mortgagee goes toreduce the mortgage debt This seems clearly correct since the mortgagor should certainly have the benefit of a contract to which he is a party and the consideration for which has been paid by him Pendleton v Elliott 67 Mich 496 35 N W 97 Pearman v Gould 42 N J Eq 4 5 Atl 811 78RECENT DECISIONS 79 See BurtonLingo Co v Patton 15 N M 304 107

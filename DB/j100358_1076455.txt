j100358,The School Review,1076455,Phillips Academy Andover Massachusetts,i244662,THE SCHOOL REVIEW A JOURNAL OF SECONDARY EDUCATION VOLUME XXII FEBRUARY 1914 NUMBER 2 PHTTLLIPS ACADEMY ANDOVER MASSACHUSETTS CLAUDE M FUESS Instructor in English Phillips Academy Phillips Academy is not a private school maintained entirely by the tuition fees of its students and operated primarily for the profit of the owners but an endowed academy controlled by a Board of Trustees and carried on under the written constitution of its Founders This fact gives it a certain valuable independence removing it from the domination of any outside influence and enabling it to deal with its students without discrimination or preju dice The original endowment since considerably increased was contributed largely by Samuel Phillips of Andover and his brother John Phillips of Exeter New Hampshire later the founder of Phillips Exeter Academy in 1783 but the plan of the institution was the project of Samuel Phillips Jr then a young man of twenty six who with the help of Eliphalet Pearson afterward first principal of the Academy drew up the constitution and set upon it the stamp of his fine moral and intellectual character The school was organ ized on April 30 I778 with thirteen pupils and on October 4 I780 it was incorporated as Phillips Academy It is therefore the earliest incorporated academy in Massachusetts and one of the oldest of the great American secondary schools Its influence upon the establishment of other academies of its type has been continuous and important The constitution a document of extraordinary sagacity and fore sight provided the Academy with an individuality which it has 73THE SCHOOL REVIEW preserved to this day The main purpose to be attained was to teach youths the great end and real business of living The field of instruction is indicated in the following paragraph In order to prevent the smallest subversion of the true intent of this Foundation it is again declared that the first and principal object of this insti tution is the promotion of true Piety and Virtue the second instruction in the English Latin and Greek languages together with Writing Arithmetic Music and the Art of Speaking the third practical Geometry Logic and Geography and the fourth such other of the Liberal Arts and Sciences or Languages as opportunity and ability may hereafter admit and as the Trustees shall direct It will be noticed that while this statement is sufficiently defin ite it is at the same time wisely elastic allowing changes when they shall seem desirable Without in any sense violating the intention of the Founders the Trustees have felt free to vary the Academy curriculum in accordance with the course of educational evolution In the constitution too it is further stipulated that the Academy shall be ever equally open to youth of requisite quali fications from every quarter In this sentence is the germ of the present cosmopolitan nature of the school drawing as it does students from all over the United States and from many foreign countries and making room for all qualified applicants regardless of race or nationality religious principles financial standing or social position In order to avoid sectarianism and provincialism it was further specified that a majority of the Trustees should be laymen and that a major part too must be nonresidents of the town in which the Academy is located The broadmindedness of Samuel Phillips has always been exemplified in the conduct of the school It was an indispensable part of the design moreover that aid toward education should be furnished to worthy scholars who might find themselves unable to meet the school expenses and in pur suance of this plan funds have been generously donated by many benefactors To this more perhaps than to any other cause the traditional democracy of the Academy may be ascribed The motto of Samuel Phillips Finis origine pendet has been amply proved in the history of the Academy From its inception it has been liberal democratic and cosmopolitan and much of its 74PHILLIPS ACADEMY ANDOVER MASSACHUSETTS success has lain in the scrupulous adherence of the Trustees to these ideals of its Founders There is unfortunately little space in an article of this scope for dwelling on the events of its past During the 135 years of its existence it has had only nine principals the most distinguished of whom have been Eliphalet Pearson John Adams Samuel H Taylor Cecil F P Bancroft and the present incumbent Alfred E Stearns who has held the office since I902 With very few checks or reverses the Academy has grown steadily and conservatively in numbers equipment and power In 1842 it absorbed the Andover Teachers Seminary transforming it into a socalled English Department which became in I893 the present scientific side of the curriculum In I908 with the removal of Andover Theological Seminary to Cambridge it acquired the extensive Seminary property in Andover thus more than doubling its previous material equipment Today the Academy owns a Chapel a Library and Administration Building an Archaeology Building three recitation halls twelve dormitories and cottages and six Faculty Houses with accommodations for students besides many other buildings occupied by the Faculty and officers of the school The plant which is some distance from the town of Andover contains about 240 acres of land There are at present 592 students from 38 states and 5 foreign countries and 40 instruct ors engaged in classroom work From every standpoint Phillips Academy has had a prosperous and creditable career The purpose of this paper however is to tell something of the present life of the Academy its aims its organization and its methods First of all as has been suggested it is essentially a democratic school but the democracy is no feeling generated or cultivated artificially by those in charge but rather an ancient tradition grounded deep in the spirit of the institution From the beginning there have been boys working their way through the Academy and they have been such an active element in the stu dent body that Dr Steams has frequently called them the back bone of the school Fully one hundred students are this year receiving assistance of various kinds in securing money for an edu cation Many capable applicants are given scholarships the amount depending on their classroom standing a large number 75THE SCHOOL REVIEW wait on tables at the DiningHall others are provided with work by the Academy in the Library or in different school buildings It is only rarely that an intelligent energetic boy does not obtain all the help that he needs As a result of a sweeping reform lately instituted these boys are now no longer segregated but are appor tioned among the cottages and dormitories even when their scholastic record is excellent in those where rooms are the most expensive A wealthy boy may thus live beside one who is abso lutely dependent upon his own labor for an education and the surroundings being the same neither feels any constraint in asso ciating with the other For decades the Commons men as they were formerly called have been leaders in student government and on school organizations they are welcomed everywhere on their own merits and the gradual disuse of the term Commons men indicates that even the nominal distinction between them and the others will shortly disappear A grave danger in many private schools is the spread of snobbishness and of an unAmerican caste antagonism In Andover this tendency except in isolated cases does not exist and the fact is the more gratifying in that democracy has been no theory preached constantly to the boys and practically thrust down their throats The situation is accepted as a natural and wholly satisfactory one It may be said truthfully and with a peculiar pride that in Phillips Academy a student comes to the front among his mates mainly through some ability or talent seldom through wealth or social prestige Moreover the boys earning their way being earnest and industrious succeed in holding their own in scholarship and even in popularity with those in the great body of the school Democracy is thus decidedly its own justification It is part of the Academy tradition that each student in prepara tion for the larger freedom of the college should have a reasonable amount of personal liberty but care is taken to see that this does not degenerate into license The idea is to make the transition to college seem natural not abrupt nor startling The average age of the students nearly seventeen years shows that many of them are fairly well along toward maturity There is then no general studyhall but the boys meet every morning at 745 for 76PHILLIPS ACADEMY ANDOVER MASSACHUSETTS the chapel exercises and then separate going either to the recita tion halls or to their own rooms for study The study and recitation hours extend from eight oclock in the morning until one from four to six in the afternoon and from eight oclock on every evening No recitations are held on Wednesday and Saturday afternoons which are devoted to recreation During study hours each boy is supposed to be either at recitation or in his own room or building except when given a signed excuse by his house officer for good and sufficient reasons These excuses are checked up at the Registrars office and no boy is allowed over seven unexcused absences in a single term It is the policy of the Academy moreover to provide for the occupation of the boys during the free periods such a variety of outside interests being offered in athletics and other forms of recreation that each student is likely to have a full day Possibly the most distinctive feature of Phillips Academy aside from its democracy is this vigorous and healthful community life Each boy is made to recognize that he is a unit in a highly developed social entity and is encouraged to play his part in promoting its welfare The Academy situated as it is outside the town is now so much a group of people in itself that there is small incentive or opportunity for seeking amusement elsewhere A boy who goes wrong under such conditions must do so wilfuliy and deliberately This is the more true because of the recent effective extension of faculty supervision In the autumn of I9I4 excluding day scholars all but about 50 of the students were located in houses controlled by members of the faculty whose jurisdiction is of course much more complete than that of any boardinghouse keeper could possibly be The instructor in charge of each hall or dormi tory is bound to maintain order in his building and can punish misconduct by the infliction of demerits For younger boys who come planning to remain during the full fouryear course a special dormitory Williams Hall has been provided in which the restric tions though not severe are calculated to assure parents that their sons will be carefully watched and guided By a progressive evo lution these boys can move in their Junior Middle year to one of a small group of other houses where they are somewhat less bound by rules and finally in the Middle and Senior years to the regular 77THE SCHOOL REVIEW dormitories where a larger responsibility is exacted For purposes of arranging schedules for students a member of the faculty called the Class Officer is assigned to each class his function being to frame the boys course of study to suit his necessities and the reguations of the Academy The student body moreover is divided into small groups of approximately i8 boys each under the charge of some faculty member who becomes for his division a sort of sponsor keeping in close touch with the work of each boy steer ing him from pitfalls and acting to a certain extent in loco parentis The Division Officer is expected to familarize himself with the previous training and character of each boy under his care to fol low his progress in the Academy morally as well as intellectually and to become thus so much of a specialist that he will be able to recommend action whenever the students name comes before the faculty for discussion In a school as large as Andover it is obviously impracticable for any one teacher to acquire a thorough acquaint ance with the entire student body but the Division Officer scheme makes the problem of government comparatively a simple one Not often will a single rule fit all cases Each separate boy usually requires different treatment depending upon his temperament his ability and his maturity This system by which one responsible person is always possessed of detailed knowledge concerning any student in question may be considered perhaps the most significant and farreaching of Dr Stearnss innovations Over matters concerning the social and fraternal life of the students the supervision of the faculty is largely advisory and seldom obtrusive Opportunities for the development of the quali ties of leadership are offered in numerous fields All teams and student organizations are managed by the boys themselves and it is uncommon for a normal boy not to find a chance for displaying any ability athletic executive or artistic which he may have In accordance with the theory of community life already outlined each boy is urged to have some interest aside from that of the required classroom work and to follow it as an avocation The semi weekly school newspaper the Phillipian is like the literary monthly the Mirror published entirely by student editors Those attracted toward public speaking are soon drawn into one of the two debating societies Philomathean and Forum Other pur 78PHILLIPS ACADEMY ANDOVER MASSACHUSETTS poses are served by the Musical Dramatic and Language clubs The Student Council comprising representatives from the various school organizations including the athletic teams the debating and musical clubs and the men of the First and Second Honor Rolls together with other elected members discusses and passes judg ment upon matters relating primarily to the direction of purely student interests Training in selfgovernment and selfreliance is constantly being brought about through various student enterprises Entirely on their own initiative the boys carry on a night school for foreigners in the nearby city of Lawrence themselves conducting classroom teaching and contributing to support a graduate director Their work in training ignorant but ambitious men in the essentials of good citizenship has won them high commendation The recently erected swimmingpool costing 30000 was paid for largely by money raised by students among themselves and their friends in the course of an aggressive campaign Frequent school meetings are held in which the leaders debate important matters A nonsectarian religious organization known as the Society of Inquiry is conducted by the boys alone Many students show ingenuity in devising new ways of earning money and several carry on successfully business enterprises The Academy in many ways attains its end of changing boys into men by giving them a measure of responsibilities and duties in the community A carefully arranged system of athletic training is also an integral part of the Academy plan Every boy in the school unless physi cally disqualified is obliged to take some form of exercise adapted to his strength and needs All teams whether of the class or of the Academy are coached by regular members of the faculty who find recreation in mingling with the boys in various forms of sport The choosing of a school team is preceded by a preliminary period of interclass games in which every candidate is given a fair chance to show his mettle From the ability displayed in these inter class contests the Academy squad is picked The uniform success of Andover teams in all branches of sport is due partly to their effi cient coaching partly to the fact that every boy is so watched by the Physical Director that he must always be in good condition Foot ball baseball and track athletics are of course the major sports but boys may take their choice elsewhere in crosscountry running 79THE SCHOOL REVIEW tennis swimming hockey soccer and lacrosse besides the gymnasium drill in the winter So large are the school fields that it is possible for eight football games or seven baseball games to be going on simultaneously As far as practicable the excitement of contests with other schools is being minimized and a healthful spirit of rivalry is aroused among the students themselves It is possible thus to lessen the danger of newspaper notoriety for promi nent athletes As has already been emphasized Phillips Academy is unique among schools in its cosmopolitan atmosphere Unlike other institutions which draw men largely from one locality or from one class Andover is truly national in its constituency The boy from Louisiana may room with one from California or sit beside one from Maine and each has much to gain from what may have been a mere fortuitous association Of the 19 men on last years football team four were from Massachusetts two each from Mis souri and Pennsylvania and one each from Tennessee Maine Nebraska Colorado New York Oregon Minnesota Texas Ohio Connecticut and Wyoming It is probable that no other educa tional institution in this country school or college could show such a varied representation on a single team It is the design of the Trustees to preserve at any cost this national representation for it is certain that this mingling of boys from one section with those from another is an education in itself Little provincialisms disappear local prejudices and peculiarities wear away and a general tolerance and breadth of view is the result It is worth adding perhaps that members of the faculty are drawn from no one college or section They represent degrees from Harvard Yale Princeton Sheffield Columbia Dartmouth Brown Amherst Williams Wesleyan Colgate Beloit St Lawrence Wabash Haver ford Lafayette Clark College and Springfield Training School and various members have studied at the Universities of Paris Ber lin Munich and Marburg and at different Oxford colleges Phillips Academy is mainly a place of preparation for college and as such its curriculum has been largely determined at least in recent years by collegeentrance requirements Its aim being however to give a thorough and effective education it prepares 80PHILLIPS ACADEMY ANDOVER MASSACHUSETTS for any college or university and is not subservient to any higher institution Its course of study is regularly four years but properly qualified applicants are admitted for the last two years or even for the Senior year only It has taken a decisive stand against the vocational training now given such exaggerated emphasis and it will remain for many years to come and it is to be hoped indefi nitely a cultural school The increasing number of candidates for admission including many every year who have to be turned away indicates that its position is a popular one among those who are not swept off their feet by the tendencies of the hour The maintenance of discipline in a school as large as Andover is naturally a somewhat perplexing problem but one that is simplified by the fact that the authorities have resolutely refused to let it become a reformatory or a home for incurables It is felt that the best interests of the Academy and of its students are furthered by removing summarily any boy who refuses to conform to the estab lished standards of scholarship or conduct The Division Officer scheme keeping at least one member of the faculty informed con cerning every student enables decisions on these difficult matters to be reached with the minimum of friction A system of cuts like that in use at most colleges gives each boy a certain leeway in the matter of occasional absences but repeated unexcused absences from regular work or appointments are followed ultimately by dis missal For low scholarship or for offenses against the school rules boys may be deprived of all excuses or put on the socalled Pro bation List the latter indicating that unless decided improvement is shown at once dismissal may be expected Since ample warning and admonition are given in each case failure is in the majority of instances due to gross carelessness or incorrigibility on the part of the student In acting as a steppingstone from high school to college Phillips Academy feels that it has had and will continue to have a valuable mission It is its aim to turn boys into clean healthy selfreliant men prepared to cope successfully with the problems either of col lege or of life The long roll of distinguished alumni and their persistent loyalty are evidences as to what extent this aim has been achieved 8I

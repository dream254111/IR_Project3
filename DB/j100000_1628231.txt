the number and character of the papers presented and in the attendance The number of papers presented was twentyfour mathematical papers predomi nating somewhat over astronomical The attendance was better in the morning than in the afternoon sessions on account of the large and attractive list of excursions planned for the afternoons by the Local Committee The list of papers follows On the Adaptability of the Glycerine Clock to the Diurnal Motion of Astronomical Instruments particularly those used in Photographing Solar Eclipses Professor DAVID P TODD Amherst College Observa tory In outline the glycerine clock is an accu rately constructed cylinder about four inches in diameter in which travels a pis ton the flow of the glycerine being con trolled at any required speed or rate by means of a series of needle valves By at taching a mirror or objective to a frame equatorially mounted the glycerine clock can be set under one arm of it at any con venient distance from the axis and the req uisite rate for counteracting the diurnal motion of the sun can be given by means of the needle valves This permits very heavy weights to be thrown on the piston and therefore the vibration of the instru ments by wind can be precluded When the run of the piston is finished the glycer ine is pumped out of the top of the cylinder and forced back into the bottom and the run is commenced over again On a Convenient Type of Finder for very large Equatorials Professor DAVID P TODD Amherst College Observatory The object of a finder is convenience But in equatorials above twenty inches in aperture the ordinary finder is necessarily mounted so far away from the axis of the great telescope that its use occasions much inconvenience simply because of the dis tance of its eyepiece from that of the great tube To obviate this difficulty Professor Todd proposes to construct the finder with a pair of reflectors either planes or prisms set at 45 and to mount the main part of its tube in rings or bearings By turning the tube in these the finders eyepiece can be brought as near the eyepiece of the great tube as is desired or pushed away from it to admit attachment or adjustment of sub sidiary apparatus Series whose Product is Absolutely Con vergent Professor FLORIAN CAJORI Colorado College This paper is a continuation of the sub ject as developed by the author in his pre vious papers Trans of the Am Math Soc Vol II pp 25361901 SCIENCE Vo1 XIV p 395 1901 Bulletin of the Am Math Soc Vol VIII pp 231236 1902 and in the article of Alfred Pringsheim Trans of the Am Math Soc Vol IIpp 404412 1901 Some of the results previously ob tained relating to absolutely convergent products of two or more series are general ized and the method of treatment is simpli fied The construction of pairs of divergent series with real or complex terms is given such that the product of the two series is not only absolutely convergent but equal to any desired value including zero A New Treatment of Volune Professor G B HALSTED University of Texas After the establishment of a sectcalculus the area of a triangle is defined as the pro duct of its base by half its altitude this product being proved independent of the choice of base Then the volume of a tetrahedron is definedas the product of the area of its base by one third its altitude this product being proved independent of 131 JULY 25 1902N S VOL XVI No 395 the choice of base The volume of a poly hedron is defined as the sum of the volumes of a set of tetrahedra into which it is cut this sum being proved independent of the mode of partition into tetrahedra Then a prismatoid is defined and its volume proved a V B 3S Then all the ordinary solids are forms of prismatoids A New Solar Attachment HERBERT A HowE Director of the Chamberlin Ob servatory University Park Colorado This was a description of a small solar of simple construction devised by Mr Orville F Shattuck a former pupil of Professor Howe It was shown how the device when attached to a universal instrument or engi neers transit may be used for some simple astronomical observations and for illustra ting the principles of the equatorial coude the prism transit the sextant and the almu cantar On the Periodic Solutions of the Problem of Three Bodies Professor E O LOVETT Princeton University Lagrange found five exact solutions of the problem of those bodies in each of which the bodies preserve an unvarying configuration which revolves with a uni form velocity When the third body is of infinitesimal mass compared with the other two it can describe small periodic orbits in the vicinity of the points where exact solu tions exist The latter points were called centers of libration by Gylden and Darwin calls the infinitely small body an oscillating satellite Hill pointed out the fertility of the notion and made a splendid application of it in his lunar theory Poincare elabo rated the mathematical theory in his cele brated researches and we owe to Darwin an extended collection of examples of periodic orbits One of the most recent investigations of such orbits is a suggestive paper by Charlier in No 18 of the Meddelanden fran Lunds Astronomiska Observatorium In the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astro nomical Society for November 1901 Plummer has discussed some of Charliers results in a more general manner It is the object of Professor Lovetts paper to determine the imaginary centers of libration and their corresponding orbits and thus complete the analytical solution proposed by Charlier The results cannot be expected to fit the sky but they may be of some interest to mathematical astron omers It appears that there are real periodic orbits corresponding to imaginary centers of libration The Rate of the Riefler Sidereal Clock No 56 Professor CHARLES S HOWE Case School of Applied Sciences In this paper Professor Howe gave the details and results of some careful series of experiments of a Riefler clock enclosed in a glass case from which the air had been par tially exhausted The mean daily rate for a trifle over three months was 116 of a second The average daily variation from this mean was 015 and the maximum vari ation 022 of a second The paper will be published in the Astronomische Nach richten A Representation of the Coordinates of the Moon in Power Series which are Proved to Converge for a Finite Interval of Time DR F R MOULTON University of Chicago It is proved in this paper that the differ ential equations which the motion of the moon must fulfill can be integrated as power series in certain parameters and that the series converge for at least a certain 132 SCIENCESCIENCE finite determinable interval of time The equations to be integrated are of the type 1 i x Xl  xn al  aP1  fk t il1  n where the xi are any variables defining the position and motion of the moon and the a s and s are parameters occurring in the differential equations Solutions as power series in the a s are sought of the form 2 x   a  ag2ag IE1    i  il  n where the xi Ei1  zy are functions of the time to be determined Substituting 2 in 1 and equating to zero the coefficients of the various powers of the os it is found that after the xi O  0 have been found the other coefficients are determined by linear nonhomogeneous differential equations which can always be solved The proof of the convergence of these series is made by employing suitable comparison differential equations There is nothing to prevent any of the Ys being numerically equal to any of the a s In fact n ltie start all the parameters are as but befolre the integrations made those which occur in a special manner as in the trigonometrical functions may be called ps When this is done in an appro priate manner all the xi 1  Pj are purely periodic functions of the time except the angular variables each of which has one term which is proportional to the time After a finite number of terms have been found they may be rearranged as Fourier series whose coefficients are power series in the as giving expressions of the same form as usually found by lunar theorists The advantages of this method are a The series are known to converge b every step is defined in advance and contains nothing arbitrary and c the work is divided up in a convenient manner The Mass of the Rings of Saturn Professor A HALL South Norfolk Conn The mass of these rings was first deter mined by Bessel in 1831 from the motion of the apsides of the orbit of Titan This motion is about half a degree in a year But the action of the figure of the planet and the attractions of the other satellites were neglected and as Bessel pointed out the resulting mass of the rings was too great This mass is 1118 the mass of Saturn being taken as the unit In this paper an equation was formed containing two indeterminate quantities depending on the figure of the planet the mass of the rings and the masses of the three brighter satellites Rhea Dione and Tethys The small resulting action of the other satellites was estimated The coeffi ciency of these six indeterminate quantities can be computed with sufficient accuracy The uncertainty in finding the mass of the rings arises chiefly from the lack of good values of the masses of the satellites These masses must be found from the mu tual perturbation of the satellites Substi tuting the values of the masses of the sat ellites determined by Professor H Struve the principal coefficient depending on the figure of the planet was assumed to be 00222 The mass of the rings is 17092 It is probable that Struves masses of the satellites are too small and the above mass of the rings too great Saturn will soon return to our northern skies and it is hoped that further observa tions and their dimensions will give good values of the constants of this interesting system 133 JULY 25 1902 N S VOL XVI No 395 On a Class of RealiFunctions to which Taylors Theorem does not apply and On a Class of Transcendental Functions with LineSingularities Professor JOHN A EISTAND Thiel College In the first paper a class of real functions to which Taylors theorem does not apply was discussed Examples of such functions were given and the nonidentity of the ex pansion with the function expanded was shown In the second paper a new type of trans cendental functions fulfilling certain condi tions within and on the unitcircle was dis cussed These conditions are The function together with all its derivatives is finite and continuous within as well as on the unit circle which is a singular line for the function The form of the functions is as follows where fz  n z  1  a e27r va lm 1  bv e2 i  limav 0 limbv  0 a is an incommensurable number and qVz     b2rva r a bve27rva 12  1  bve2riva   1  bve2iiva  r 1  v

constructing a steel sphere one hundred feet in diameter in connection with a new method of mounting a tele scope as outlined in an article in the Amer ican Journal of Science for June 1902 by Professor David P Todd of Amherst Col lege If a regular dodecaedron be inscribed in a sphere planes determined by the center and each edge of the dodecaedron cut out on the sphere twelve equal regular spher ical pentagons If the vertices of each pen tagon be connected with its center by arcs of great circles the surface of the sphere is divided into sixty congruent isosceles spherical triangles whose angles are deter mined as 60 60 and 72 A Possible New Law in the Theory of Elas ticity Professor J BURKITT WEBB Stevens Institute of Technology Owing to the absence of Professor Webb at the time this paper was called for it was presented only in abstract The law re ferred to in the title is If the forcible change of the distance between two points in an elastic sytem changes the distance of two other points by a certain amount then the same force applied to alter the distance of the two other points will change the dis tance of the first two points by the same amount  On Extracting Roots of Numbers by Sub traction Dr ARTEMUS MARTIN Wash ington D C A paper on Evolution by Subtraction was published in the Philosophical Maga zine for September 1880 communicated by the Rev F H Hummell who ascribed the method to his friend and neighbor the Rev W B Cole The rule given in Mr Hum mells paper for finding the square root of any number is From any square number subtract the even numbers in succession beginning with 2 until the remainder is less than the next even number to be subtracted This re mainder will be the square root sought The statement of the rule may be simpli fied as follows For the nth subtrahend add 2 to the pre ceding subtrahend The last remainder will be the square root sought Or For the nth subtrahend multiply n by 2 the last remainder will be the square root sought 134 SCIENCESCIENCE To find the cube root of a number the rule is For the nth subtrahend multiply n by 6 and add the preceding subtrahend the last remainder will be the cube root sought Thus the first subtrahend is 6 the next 6X26 18 the third 6X31836 and so on For the fourth root the rule is To find the nth subtrahend multiply n2 by 12 and add 2 plus the preceding subtra hend the last remainder will be the root sought In the paper rules are given for finding the fifth sixth seventh eighth ninth and tenth roots with examples General formulas for the nth subtrahend of any root the mth are Snnlm nm  or Sn  l  n  1  n  1n  2n It is shown in the paper that in all cases for all roots the number of subtractions to be performed is one less than the num ber of units in the root sought and conse quently the root equals number of subtrac tions plus 1 A table of subtrahends containing the first ten subtrahends for the first eleven roots is appended to the paper This table can be extended to any desired extent by the rules and formulas given The paper will be published in the Math ematical Magazine On the Determination of the Places of the Circumpolar Stars Professor MILTON UPDEGRAFF U S Naval Observatory The contents of this paper are A sketch of previous work done on circumpolar stars 2 a statement of the kind of work needed and 3 some suggestions as to the best methods to be used in redeterminations of the coordinates of the circtmpolar stars The paper will be published in one of the astronomical journals Report on Quaternions Professor ALEX ANDER MACFARLANE Lehigh University This paper will be printed in full in the Proceedings of the Association The Definite Determination of the Causes of Variation in Level and Azimuth of Large Meridian Instruments Professor G W HOUGH Dearborn Observatory Evanston Ill This was an elaborate discussion of the various styles of mounting for meridian in struments and of the effects of changes of temperature in causing variation The re sults of several long series of observations upon this effect were exhibited Professor Houghs conclusion was that stone piers give the best results The paper gave rise to some spirited discussion A New Founding of Spherics Professor G B HALSTED University of Texas Professor Hlalsted presented under this title some abstracts from a book which he is about to publish The author made a simple set of assumptions 1 of associa tion 2 of betweenness 3 of congru ence and he then showed how without the assumption that the straight line is the shortest distance between two points or that the shortest path between two points on a sphere is on the great circle through them or even that two sides of a triangle are together greater than the third all the projective and metric properties of spherics are established Report on the Theory of Collineations Professor H B NEWSON University of Kansas Owing to Professor Newsons absence from the meeting this paper could be pre sented only by title It will be printed in full in the Proceedings 135 JULY 25 1902N S VOL XVI No 395 Second Report on Recent Progress in the Theory of Groups of Finite Order Pro fessor G A MILLER Stanford Univer sity In the absence of Professor Miller this report was presented in abstract by Dr W B Fite of Cornell University It will be published in the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society Displacements Polygons Professor J BURKITT WEBB Stevens Institute of Technology Owing to the absence of Professor Webb at the time this paper was called for it was read by title Some Tlveorems on Ordinary Continued Fractions Professor THOMAS E McKIN NEY Marietta College Let D be any positive integer not a per fect square and let its square root be repre sented by an ordinary continued frac tion This paper determines the form of D so that the continued fraction representing its square root may have a period with one two three or four elements and applies the results to the determination of the num ber of reduced forms in the class to which the indefinite quadratic form 1 0 D belongs On the Forms of Sextic Scrolls of Genus One Dr VIRGIL SNYDER Cornell Univer sity In his classification of sextic scrolls of genus 1 Dr Snyder employed the method of point correspondence between two plane sections and made use of the following theorems which were proved in one of his former papers 1 The nodal curve sim ple or composite is of order 9 2 every generator cuts four others and 3 any nonreducible plane curve lying on the sur face is of genus 1 Thirtythree types are found ten of which have a multiple conic It will be published in the American Journal of Mathematics Transformation of the Hypergeometric Series Professor EDGAR FRISBY U S Naval Observatory If in the differential equation of the second order connecting the elements of the hypergeometric series P 1 xt t   1p n x2 etc Y 1 2y y1 xFP be substituted for P new relations are obtained in which P takes the place of P and the new elements are functions of the original elements  is determined from the condition that the new series must be of the same general form as the old If in addition x be replaced by 1x another series is obtained From these two new series by proper substitution of the new derived elements are obtained almost by inspection the twenty different series ordinarily given in works on differential equations

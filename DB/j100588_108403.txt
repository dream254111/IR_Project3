THE ORGANIC BASES BY DR A W HOFMANN FCS PROFESSOR OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF CHEMISTRY OF LONDON SECOND MEMOIR COMMUNICATED BY SIR JAMES CLARK BART FRS RECEIVED MARCH 12READ APRIL 3 1851 ABOUT TWELVE MONTHS AGO I HAD THE HONOUR OF PRESENTING TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY AN ACCOUNT OF A SERIES OF RESEARCHES INTO THE MNOLECULAR CONSTITUTION OF THE VOLATILE ORGANIC BASES AT PRESENT I BEG TO SUBMIT TO THE CONSIDERATION OF THE SOCIETY THE HISTORY OF A NEW GROUP OF ALKALOIDS WHICH ALTHOUGH INTIMATELY CONNECTED WITH THE FORMER BY THEIR ORIGIN DIFFER FROM THEM ALTOGETHER BY THEIR PROPERTIES AND ESPECIALLY IN NOT BEING VOLATILE THE MEMBERS OF THIS NEW GROUP OF ALKALOIDS ARE SO NUMEROUS THEIR DEPORTMENT IS SO SINGULAR AND THEIR DERIVATIVES RAIMIFY IN SO MANY DIRECTIONS THAT I HAVE NOT AS YET BEEN ABLE TO COMPLETE THE STUDY OF THESE SUBSTANCES IN ALL THEIR BEARINGS NOR IS IT MY INTENTION TO GO FULLY INTO THE CHEMISTRY OF THE SUBJECT IN THE PRESENT COM NUNICATION MY OBJECT BEING MERELY TO ESTABLISH THE EXISTENCE OF THESE BODIES AND TO GIVE A GENERAL OUTLINE OF THEIR CONNECTION WITH THE VOLATILE BASES AND OF THEIR MOST PLOMINENT CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES RESERVING A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THEIR SALTS AND DERIVATIVES TO A FUTURE MEMOIR IN THE PAPER ABOVE REFERRED TO I ADVANCED THE POSITION THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE VOLATILE ORGANIC BASES MIGHT BE REPRESENTED BY THE GENERAL EXPRESSION X Y N ZJ A FORMULA WHICH COINCIDES WITH THAT OF AMMONIA IF XYZH I PROVED BY EX PERIMENT THAT THE TERMS X Y AND Z MAY REPRESENT NOT ONLY HYDROGEN BUT A VARIETY OF HYDROCARBONS ESPECIALLY THE SOCALLED ALCOHOLRADICALS CN HN AND ENDEAVOURED ON THE GROUND OF THESE EXPERIMENTS TO CLASSIFY THE VOLATILE ORGANIC BASES ACCORDING TO THE AMOUNT OF BASICT HYDROGEN RETAINED IN THE SEVERAL ALKALOIDS I THUS ARRIVED AT THREE GROUPS OF BASES FOR WHICH IN ACCORDANCE WITH TRADITIONAL NAMES I PROPOSED THE TERMS AMIDOGENBASES IMIDOGENBASES AND NITRILEBASES THE IDEAS ENUNCIATED REGARDING THE CONSTITUTION OF THE VOLATILE ORGANIC BASES WERE IT IS TRUE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT THE RESULT OF THEORETICAL SPECULATION BUT THEY WERE SO  PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS PART I 1850 P 93 T IBID P 111 MDCCCLI 3 ADR A W HOFMANNS RESEARCHES INTO THE PERFECTLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALL THE OBSERVATIONS RECORDED AND HAD BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE TEST OF EXPERIMENT IN SO MANY DIRECTIONS THAT NO DOUBT WAS LEFT IN MY MIND REGARDING THEIR CORRECTNESS STILL THE FORMER INQUIRY HAD ELICITED SEVERAL FACTS WHICH I WAS UNABLE TO EXPLAIN BY THE VIEW WHICH I HAD TAKEN THESE FACTS I HAVE SINCE ENDEAVOURED TO ELUCIDATE BY ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS THE RESULTS DETAILED IN THE FOL LOWING PAGES I AM HAPPY TO SAY ARE IN PERFECT ACCORDANCE WITH MY FORMER OBSERVA TIONS THE EXTENSION OF WHICH HAS LED ME AT THE SAME TIME TO A STILL MORE GENERAL CONCEPTION OF THE QUESTION AFTER HAVING SUCCEEDED IN REPLACING STEP BY STEP ONE TWO OR THREE EQUIVALENTS OF HYDROGEN IN AMMONIA BY A CORRESPONDING NUMBER OF COMPOUND ATOMS THE QUESTION AROSE WHETHER THE AGENT BY WHICH THESE CHANGES WERE AFFECTED WOULD EXERT A STILL FARTHER INFLUENCE UPON THE LAST PRODUCT OF THE REACTION IN ORDER TO DECIDE THIS QUES TION BY EXPERIMENT I SUBMITTED TWO NITRILEBASES DIETHYLANILINE AND TRIETHYLAMINE TO A PROLONGED ACTION OF BROMIDE OF ETHYL THESE EXPERIMENTS OF WHICH A FULL AC COUNT IS GIVEN IN MY PRECEDING MEMOIR PAGES 106 AND 122 DID NOT LEAD TO PER FECTLY DECISIVE RESULTS IT WAS EVIDENT THAT IN THESE CASES A REACTION ENSUED EVEN ON USING BOTH THE BASE UNDER EXAMINATION AND THE BROMIDE IN THE ABSOLUTELY DRY STATE A GRADUAL CHANGE WAS OBSERVED TO TAKE PLACE A SMALL BUT UNMISTAKEABLE QUANTITY OF HYDROBROMATES BEING INVARIABLY FORMED NO DOUBT HOWEVER COULD BE ENTERTAINED AS TO THIS REACTION BEING ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT FROM THE PRECEDING STAGES OF THE PROCESS FOR INSTANCE THE CONVERSION OF AMMONIA INTO ETHYLAMINE OF ETHYLAMINE TO DIETHYL AMINE C IT WAS PROVED MOREOVER BY CAREFUL AND FREQUENTLYREPEATED EXPERIMENT THAT THIS PROCESS WHATEVER ITS NATURE MIGHT BE IN NO CASE GAVE RISE TO THE FORMATION OF ANY OTHER VOLATILE BASES CONTAINING A LARGER NUMBER OF REPLACING RADICALS THAN THE NITRILEBASE SUBMITTED TO INVESTIGATION I HAVE BEEN AGAIN STUDYING THESE REACTIONS DURING THE PAST YEAR ON A MUCH LARGER SCALE WHEREBY THE EXPERILNENTS WERE GREATLY FACILITATED AND HERE I GLADLY AVAIL MY SELF OF AN OPPORTUNITY OF EXPRESSING MY SINCERE THANKS TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY FOR THE KIND AND ENCOURAGING INTEREST THEY HAVE TAKEN IN THIS INQUIRY THE NEW RESULTS OF WHICH ARE MAINLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THEIR LIBERAL AND MUNIFICENT SUPPORT ACTION OF BROMIDE AND IODIDE OF ETHYL UPON TRIETHYLAMINE IN THE PAPER REPEATEDLY REFERRED TO I HAVE STATED THAT A MIXTURE OF AN AQUEOUS SOLUTION OF TRIETHYLAMINE AND BROMIDE OF ETHYL SEALED UP IN A TUBE SOLIDIFIED AFTER SEVERAL HOURS EBULLITION AND THAT THE CRYSTALS CONSISTED CHIEFLY OF THE FIBROUS HYDRO BROTNATE OF TRIETHYLAMINE WITH WHICH HOWEVER A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF WHITE OPAKE GRA NULAR CRYSTALS INVARIABLY WAS MIXED I HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO INCREASE THE QUANTITY OF THE LATTER BY USING BOTH THE BROMIDE OF ETHYL AND THE TRIETHYLAMNINE IN THE ANHYDROUS STATE BUT BY THUS CHANGING THE CONDITIONS OF THE FORMATION THE PROGRESS OF THE REACTION IS RETARDED IN THE NMOST REMARKABLE MANNER DAYS ELAPSING BEFORE THE CON 358MOLECULAR CONSTITUTION OF THE ORGANIC BASES VERSION IS COMPLETED WHILE ENGAGED IN THESE EXPERIMENTS I FOUND THAT THE RESULT INTENDED MAY BE OBTAINED ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSLY BY SUBSTITUTING THE IODIDE FOR THE BROMIDE OF ETHYL AND AS THIS OBSERVATION WAS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY A PERFECT ELUCIDATION OF THE WHOLE QUESTION I HAVE SCARCELY RETURNED AGAIN TO THE USE OF THE BROMIDE ON ADDING PERFECTLY ANHYDROUS IODIDE OF ETHYL TO TRIETHYLAMINE DRIED OVER HYDRATE OF POTASSA THE MIXTURE BECOMES SLIGHTLY TURBID HEAT BEING EVOLVED AT THE SAME TIME AT THE COMMON TEMPERATURE THE ACTION GOES ON VERY GRADUALLY AND AFTER THE LAPSE OF SEVERAL DAYS THE MIXTURE IS CONVERTED INTO A SOLID MASS ON THE OTHER HAND IF THE MIXTURE BE EXPOSED FOR A MINUTE OR TWO TO THE TEMPERATURE OF BOILING WATER A VERY POWERFUL REACTION ENSULES THE LIQUID REMAINS EVEN AFTER THE REMOVAL OF THE SOURCE OF HEAT FOR SOME TIME IN A STATE OF LIVELY EBULLITION AND SOLIDIFIES AFTER COOLING INTO A HARD MASS OF CRYSTALS WHICH IS SNOWWHITE OR OF A YELLOWISH TINT ACCORDING AS EITHER THE TRIETHYLAMINE OR THE IODIDE OF ETHYL HAS BEEN IN EXCESS TO AVOID LOSING IODIDE OF ETHYL AND ESPECIALLY TRIETHYLAMINE WHICH IS THE RESULT OF A LONG SERIES OF TROUBLESOME AND EXPENSIVE PROCESSES I HAVE USUALLY PERFORMED THE REACTION IN STRONG GLASS TUBES OF BETWEEN THREE AND FOUR FEET IN LENGTH WHICH WERE SEALED BEFORE THE BLOWPIPE AFTER THE SUBSTANCES HAD BEEN INTRODUCED THE CRYSTALLINE MASS PRODUCED IN THIS REACTION READILY DISSOLVES EVEN IN COLD WATER IF THE IODIDE WAS IN EXCESS THIS SUBSTANCE SEPARATES IN HEAVY OILY GLOBULES WHICH MAY BE READILY SEPARATED AND RECOVERED BY DISTILLATION AND THE SOLUTION IS INODOROUS AND EITHER NEUTRAL OR VERY SLIGHTLY ACID IN THE LATTER CASE IT HAS ALWAYS A MARKED YELLOWISH TINT ON THE OTHER HAND IF THE BASE WAS IN EXCESS THE SOLUTION OF THE CRYSTALS WAS COLOURLESS AND ALKALINE THE ALKALINE REACTION DISAPPEARS HOWEVER ON EBUL LITION TRIETHYLAMINE BEING DISENGAGED THE CRYSTALS ARE LIKEWISE SOLUBLE IN ALCOHOL BUT ALMOST INSOLUBLE IN ETHER THE PURIFICATION OF THE CRYSTALS IS NOT ATTENDED WITH ANY DIFFICULTIES IT IS IN FACT SUFFICIENT TO DISSOLVE THEM IN COLD WATER AND TO ALLOW THE SOLUTION TO EVAPORATE SPON TANEOUSLY WHEN BEAUTIFUL WELLDEFINED WHITE CRYSTALS OF CONSIDERABLE SIZE ARE DEPO SITED WHICH MAY BE EASILY SEPARATED BY MECHANICAL MEANS FROM SMALL QUANTITIES OF A REDDISH IODINECOMPOUND WHICH IS SOMETIMES FORMED BY THE ACTION OF THE AIR THIS LATTER SUBSTANCE IS FORMED IN MUCH LARGER QUANTITY AT HIGHER TEMPERATURES WHEREFORE IT IS ADVISABLE TO AVOID THE USE OF BOILING WATER IN THE PURIFICATION THE CRYSTALS ARE ANHYDROUS WHEN EXPOSED TO THE TEMPERATURE OF BOILING WATER THEY EXHIBIT NO CHANGE IN WEIGHT WHEN SUBMITTED TO ANALYSIS THEY GAVE THE FOLLOW ING RESULTS I 0A4385 GRM OF SUBSTANCE GAVE 06015 GRM OF CARBONIC ACID AND 03040 GRM OF

THIS FORMATION IS THE CHANGE WHICH THE IODINECOMPOUND UNDERGOES WHEN SUBJECTED TO THE ACTION OF HEAT WHEN RAPIDLY HEATED THE CRYSTALS FUSE AND ARE DECOMPOSED THE PRODUCTS BEING TRIETHYLAMINE AND IODIDE OF ETHYL WHICH FORM TWO LAYERS IN THE RECEIVER BUT RAPIDLY UNITE AGAIN TO THE ORIGINAL COMPOUND IN FACT THIS RECOMNBINATION TAKES PLACE TO A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT IN THE NECK OF THE RETORT SO THAT WHEN FIRST I BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH THIS SUBSTANCE I WAS FOR SOME TIME UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THE IODINECOMPOUND MIGHT BE VOLATILIZED WITHOUT DECOMPOSITION I CONFESS I HAD NOT ANTICIPATED THE POSSIBILITY OF THE EXISTENCE OF A COMPOUND HAVING THE ABOVE COMPOSITION IT APPEARED AT THE FIRST GLANCE IN DIRECT OPPOSITION TO THE THEORETICAL VIEW REPEATEDLY REFERRED TO FOR IF IT WAS POSSIBLE TO DECOMPOSE THE NEW IODIDE BY POTASSA JUST AS THE PRECEDING IODIDES OBTAINED RESPECTIVELY BY THE AC TION OF BROMIDE OR IODIDE OF ETHYL UPON AMMONIA ETHYLAMINE AND DIETHYLAMINE IF IT WAS POSSIBLE TO SEPARATE FROM THIS SUBSTANCE A NEW VOLATILE BASE ANALOGOUS TO THE PRECEDING ETHYLATED ALKALOIDS THERE WAS NO REASON WHY THE PROCESS OF ETHYLATION SHOULD CEASE WITH THE FOURTH EQUIVALENT OF ETHYL ON THE CONTRARY IT THEN APPEARED MORE THAN PROBABLE THAT THE FORMATIONS OF ETHYLAMINE DIETHYLAMINE AND TRIETHYL AMINE FAR FROM BEING DUE TO A SUCCESSIVE REPLACEMENT OF THE VARIOUS EQUIVALENTS OF HYDROGEN IN AMMONIA WERE RATHER TO BE CONSIDERED AS SPECIAL INSTANCES OF A FAR MORE GENERAL TENDENCY OF CARBON AND HYDROGEN TO ACCUMULATE IN ORGANIC SUBSTANCES 360MOLECULAR CONSTITUTION OF THE ORGANIC BASES THE EAGERNESS WITH WHICH I SUBMITTED THIS QUESTION TO THE TEST OF EXPERIMENT MAY BE READILY IMAGINED ON ADDING POTASSA TO A SOLUTION OF THE IODINECOMPOUND IN WATER THE LIQUID SOLIDIFIED AT ONCE INTO A CRYSTALLINE MASS WHICH I TOOK OF COURSE FOR THE BASE EXISTING IN THE IODIDE ANALYSIS HOWEVER SOON SHOWED THAT THE SUBSTANCE THUS PRECIPITATED IS NOTHING BUT THE IODIDE ITSELF WHICH IS LESS SOLUBLE IN AN ALKALINE SOLUTION THAN IN PURE WATER IN FACT ANALYSIS IV WAS MADE WITH A SPECIMEN WHICH HAD THUS BEEN TREATED WITH POTASSA THE IODIDE WAS NOW DISTILLED WITH A VERY CONCENTRATED SOLUTION OF POTASSA FOR SEVERAL HOURS BUT DURING THIS TIME NOTHING BUT PURE WATER PASSED OVER THE SOLUTION IN THE RETORT SOLIDIFIED ON COOLING TO CRYSTALS OF THE UNCHANGED IODIDE WHEN THE SOLUTION OF THE IODIDE IN POTASSA HAD BECOME VERY CONCENFTRATED IT SEPARATED INTO TWO LAYERS AN AQUEOUS ONE AND AN OILY ONE WHICH FLOATED ON THE SURFACE BUT EVEN NOW NO DECOMPOSITION HAD BEEN INDUCED THE OILY STRATUM SOLIDIFYING ON COOLING INTO A CRYSTALLINE CAKE OF IODIDE PERFECTLY UNALTERED IT WAS ONLY WHEN THE LIQUID WAS EVAPORATED TO DRYNESS THAT A CHANGE TOOK PLACE BUT THEN THE CHANGE WAS NO LONGER DUE TO THE ACTION OF THE POTASSA BUT TO THE INFLUENCE OF HEAT AND IN NO WAY DIFFERED FROM THE DECOMPOSITION WHICH THE CLYSTALS UNDERGO WHEN HEATED ALONE THE DEPORTMENT WITH POTASSA OF THE NEW IODINECOMPOUND ALTOGETHER PRECLUDES THE IDEA OF CONSIDERING IT AS AN ANALOGUE OF THE HYDRIODIDES OF ETHYLAMINE DIETHYLAMINE AND TIIETHYLAMINE ALL OF WHICH ARE READILY DECOMPOSED UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE ALKALIES HOWEVER THE IODINE THOUGH IT CANNOT BE ELIMINATED FROM THE CRYSTALS BY THE ALKALIES MAY BE SEPARATED WITH THE GREATEST FACILITY BY SILVERSALTS IN FACT THE NITRATE THE SULPHATE THE OXIDE OF SILVER BEHAVE WITH THE IODINECOMPOUND EXACTLY AS WITH IODIDE OF POTASSIUM OR SODIUM ON ADDING NITRATE OF SILVER TO A SOLUTION OF THE IODIDE IODIDE OF SILVER IS AT ONCE PRECIPITATED AND A NITRATE REMAINS IN SOLUTION WHICH ON EVAPORATION CRYSTALLIZES IN DELIQUESCENT NEEDLES WITH SULPHATE OF SILVER A PERFECTLY SIMILAR CHANGE TAKES PLACE AN ANALOGOUS SULPHATE REMAINING IN SOLUTION DURING THESE INTERCHANGES THE LIQUIDS REMAIN PERFECTLY NEUTRAL IF THE SOLUTION OF THE IODIDE BE DIGESTED WITH FRESHLY PRECIPITATED PROTOXIDE OF SILVER THE SOLUTION AT ONCE ASSUMES A POWERFULLY ALKALINE REACTION IODIDE OF SILVER BEING FORMED THE SAME EFFECT IS PRO DUCED BY THE ACTION OF CAUSTIC BARYTA UPON THE SULPHATE SULPHATE OF BARYTA BEING PRECIPITATED THESE REACTIONS WHEN VIEWED COLLECTIVELY EXHIBIT A STRIKING ANALOGY BETWEEN THE NEW IODIDE AND THE METALLIC IODIDES ESPECIALLY THOSE OF THE ALKALIMETALS IN FACT THE MOLECULAR GROUP COMBINED WITH IODINE IN THE COMPOUND UNDER EXAMINA TION BEHAVES LIKE SODIUM OR POTASSIUM  IT IS A TRUE ORGANIC METAL IN ALL ITS BEARINGS FOR THIS METAL I PROPOSE ON THE GROUND OF ITS FORMATION AND COMPOSITION THE NAME TETRETHYLAMMONIUM RERPA WHICH IMPLIES THAT IT IS BUILT UP BY THE INTIMATE UNION OF NITROGEN WITH FOUR EQUIVALENTS OF THE HYPOTHETICAL HYDROCARBON CALLED ETHYL AND THAT IT MAY BE VIEWED AS AMMONIUM IN WHICH THE WHOLE OF THE HYDROGEN IS REPLACED BY AN EQUIVALENT PROPORTION OF THE ABOVE HYDROCARBON 361DR A W HOFMANNS RESEARCHES INTO THE AMMONIUM TETRETHYLAMMONIUM HF C H4 N C 5 NC16H2O N HJ C4 H5 HIJ C4 NHJ THE NEW CRYSTALLINE COMPOUND ACCORDING TO THIS MODE OF VIEWING IT MUST BE CON SIDERED AS IODIDE OF TETRETHYLAMMONIUM AND ITS FORMATION TAKES PLACE IN CONSE QUENCE OF A TRANSPOSITION OF THE ELEMENTS WHICH IS PERFECTLY ANALOGOUS TO THAT ASSUMED BY THE FOLLOWERS OF THE AMMONIUMTHEORY IN THE FORMATION OF IODIDE OF AMMONIUM FROM AMMONIA AND HYDRIODIC ACID BH  3 H1 H N H I H N I H H C4H5 1 H5 C41H1 H5JNC41 C4H5  C4HS5NC4HS 4 IN 1 C4 H5 C4 H J I WILL NOT ENTER HERE INTO THE MERITS OF THE AMMONIUMTHEORY THE QUESTION WHETHER THIS MODE OF REPRESENTING THE CONSTITUTION OF THE AMMONIASALTS BE CORRECT OR NOT MAY BE LEFT OUT OF CONSIDERATION FOR THE PRESENT THE VIEW I HAVE TAKEN OF THE NEW COMPOUND AND WHICH I READILY ADMIT MUST STAND AND FALL WITH THE AMMO NIUMTHEORY HAS THE GREAT ADVANTAGE OF CLOSELY ASSIMILATING THESE SUBSTANCES TO THE COMPOUNDS OF MINERAL CHEMISTRY WHEREBY THE NOMENCLATURE IS ESSENTIALLY FACILITATED I WILL NOW PROCEED TO GIVE A SKETCH OF THE TETRETHYLAMMONIUMCOMPOUNDS AS FAR AS THIS IS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO CONVEY A CLEAR PERCEPTION OF THE CHARACTER AND THE PECULIARITIES OF THIS GROUP OF BODIES I RESERVE A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THE DERIVATIVES OF THIS GROUP TO A SPECIAL MEMOIR IN WHICH I INTEND TO GIVE MOREOVER A FULLER DE SCRIPTION OF DIETHYLAMINE AND TRIETHYLAMINE WHICH WERE ONLY BRIEFLY NOTICED IN MY FORMER PAPER AMONG THE VARIOUS SUBSTANCES DERIVED FROM THE NEW IODIDE THE CORRESPONDING OXIDE THE COMPOUND CORRESPONDING TO OXIDE OF ARNMONIUM ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION IN A PREEMINENT DEGREE OXIDE OF TETRETHYLAMMONIUM I HAVE ALREADY BRIEFLY STATED HOW THIS SUBSTANCE IS PREPARED ON DECOMPOSING THE IODIDE WITH AN EXCESS OF SULPHATE OF SILVER A SULPHATE IS OBTAINED FROM WHICH SUL PHURIC ACID AND EXCESS OF SILVER MAY BE SEPARATED BY BARYTA THIS WAS IN FACT THE FIRST PROCESS BY WHICH I SEPARATED THE BASE IT IS HOWEVER DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN THE SOLUTION IN THIS MANNER FREE FROM EITHER BARYTA OR SULPHURIC ACID NOR HAVE I EVER 362MOLECULAR CONSTITUTION OF THE ORGANIC BASES USED THIS PROCESS AGAIN AFTER I HAD FOUND THAT DIGESTION WITH FRESHLY PRECIPITATED PROTOXIDE OF SILVER PRODUCES AT ONCE THE SAME EFFECT THE OXIDE IS ADDED IN SMALT PROPORTIONS TO THE SOLUTION OF THE IODIDE WHICH IS GENTLY HEATED IT IS IMMEDIATELY CONVERTED INTO YELLOW IODIDE OF SILVER WHICH ASSUMES A WHITE COLOUR ON STIRRING AS LONG AS ANY UNDECOMPOSED IODIDE IS IN SOLUTION GRADUALLY THE YELLOW COLOUR BE COMES PERMANENT AND THE DECOMPOSITION IS COMPLETE AS SOON AS AN EXCESS OF UN CHANGED OXIDE BECOMES PERCEPTIBLE BY ITS COLOUR ON FILTERING OFF THE SILVERPRECIPITATE A CLEAR AND COLOURLESS LIQUID IS OBTAINED WHICH CONTAINS THE ISOLATED BASE IN SOLUTION IT IS OF A POWERFULLY ALKALINE REACTION WHICH MANIFESTS ITSELF NOT ONLY IN ITS DEPORTMENT WITH VEGETABLE COLOURS BUT ALSO IN ITS POSSESSING THE PUNGENT BITTERNESS OF QUININE THE SOLUTION WHEN STRONGLY CON CENTRATED NOT ONLY BURNS THE TONGUE BUT IT ACTS UPON THE EPIDERMIS WHICH IT DE STROYS LIKE CAUSTIC POTASSA OR SODA ON RUBBING A SOLUTION OF THE OXIDE BETWEEN THE FINGERS THE WELLKNOWN SENSATION PRODUCED BY THE FIXED ALKALIES UNDER THE SAME CIR CUMSTANCES IS FELT AND WE PERCEIVE MOREOVER THE SAME PECULIAR ODOUR OXIDE OF TETRETHYLAMMONIUM SAPONIFIES THE FATS AS READILY AS POTASSA THE EXPE RIMENT WAS MADE WITH COCOANUT OIL WHICH AFTER HALF AN HOURS EBULLITION WITH THE NEW ALKALI WAS CONVERTED INTO A BEAUTIFUL SOFT SOAP HAVING THE APPEARANCE OF AN ORDINARY POTASSASOAP THIS SOAP WASHES VERY WELL I HAVE TRACED THE ANALOGY OF THE NEW BODY WITH POTASSA IN MANY OTHER DIRECTIONS CHEMISTS RECOLLECT THE REMARKABLE EFFECT PRODUCED BY EBULLITION WITH POTASSA IN CER TAIN NITROGENOUS SUBSTANCES IT WAS BY THIS PROCESS THAT DR FOWNES THE DISCOVERER OF THIS REACTION CONVERTED FURFURAMIDE INTO THE ISOMNERIC ALKALOID FURFURINE I FOUND THAT BOILING WITH OXIDE OF TETRETHYLAMMONIUM EFFECTS THIS MOLECULAR CHANGE AS RAPIDLY AS POTASSA LIKE POTASSA IT DECOMPOSES OXALIC ETHER INTO OXALIC ACID AND ALCOHOL AND EVOLVES AMMONIA FIOM AMMONIASALTS EVEN IN THE COLD IT MAY

THE BASE EXHIBIT THE SAME REACTIONS WITH POTASSA AND OXIDE OF TETRETHYLAMMONIUM ALTHOUGH I DID NOT ANTICIPATE GREAT RESULTS FROM THE EXPERIMENT I HAVE SUBMITTED THE NEW BASE TO THE ACTION OF THE GALVANIC CURRENT THE PILE BEING DISPOSED AS IN BERZELIUSS ORIGINAL EXPERIMENT ON THE FORMATION OF THE AMMONIUMAMALGAM 364MOLECULAR CONSTITUTION OF THE ORGANIC BASES HOWEVER NO PHENOMENON OTHER THAN THE DECOMPOSITION OF WATER WAS OBSERVED THIS DECOMPOSITION CERTAINLY APPEARED TO BE FACILITATED ESPECIALLY IF THE BASE WAS EMPLOYED IN THE FORM OF SULPHATE NOR HAD POTASSIUMAMALGAM THE SLIGHTEST EFFECT UPON OXIDE OF TETRETHYLAMMONIUM I MUST STILL MENTION A PECULIAR REACTION SOMEWHAT SINGULAR AT THE FIRST GLANCE WHICH TAKES PLACE ON ADDING THE CONCENTRATED OXIDE TO ALKALINE SOLUTIONS OF IODIDE OF POTASSIUM WHEN THE CRYSTALLINE IODIDE OF TETRETHYLAMMONIUM IS AT ONCE PRECIPITATED I NEED SCARCELY REMARK THAT THIS PHENOMENON IS DUE TO THE INSOLUBILITY OF THE IODIDE IN ALKALINE SOLUTIONS AND NOT TO THE NEW BASE POSSESSING A GREATER AFFINITY FOR IODINE THAN POTASSIUM WHOSE OXIDE IS THUS ACTUALLY LIBERATED A MODERATELY CONCENTRATED SOLUTION OF OXIDE OF TETRETHYLAMMONIUM MAY BE BOILED WITHOUT ALTERATION IT IS ONLY IN A VERY ADVANCED STAGE OF EVAPORATION THAT DECOMPO SITION GRADUALLY SETS IN THE CHANGE OCCURS EVEN IN THE WATERBATH AS SOON AS THE BASE BECOMES NEARLY DRY ON EVAPORATING HOWEVER UNDER THE BELL OF THE AIRPUMP IN THE PRESENCE OF SULPHURIC ACID AND LIME THE BASE MAY BE OBTAINED IN THE DRY STATE I HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO OBTAIN IT IN THIS MANNER IN A CONDITION FIT FOR ANALYSIS BUT ALL MY ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN HITHERTO IN VAIN A CONCENTRATED SOLUTION OF THE OXIDE WHEN PLACED IN A VACUUM DEPOSITS AFTER SOME DAYS EXPOSURE LONG HAIRLIKE NEEDLES WHICH ARE HOWEVER DELIQUESCENT IN THE EXTREME AND ATTRACT CARBONIC ACID WITH GREAT AVIDITY IN BOTH RESPECTS THEY ARE SCARCELY INFERIOR TO POTASSA BY REMAINING LONGER IN VACUO THESE CRYSTALS DISAPPEAR AGAIN AND THE WHOLE LIQUID DRIES UP TO A SEMISOLID MASS WHICH ALSO DELIQUESCES RAPIDLY AND BECOMES CARBONATED ON EXPOSURE TO THE AIR AS THERE WAS NOT THE SLIGHTEST CHANCE OF GETTING THIS SUBSTANCE INTO A COMBUSTIONTUBE I ENDEAVOURED TO ASCERTAIN ITS COMPOSITION BY DECOMPOSING A KNOWN QUANTITY OF THE IODIDE WITH PROTOXIDE OF SILVER EVAPORATING IN VACUO IN A GLASS DISH WHICH ON REMOVING FROTN THE AIRPUMP COULD BE COVERED WITH A GLASS PLATE AND DETERMINING THE WEIGHT OF THE SOLID MASS REMAINING THESE EXPERIMENTS HOWEVER HAVE NOT LED TO ANY DECISIVE RESULTS SOON AFTER THE FORMATION OF THE CRYSTALS THE LIQUID BECOMES COATED WITH A THIN PELLICLE WHICH RETARDS THE EVAPORATION TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT EVEN AFTER A FORTNIGHTS EXPOSURE THE MASS STILL CONTINUES TO LOSE IN WEIGHT BUT BY THAT TIME HOWEVER CAREFULLY THE AIR WAS EXCLUDED THE BASE HAS PARTLY BEEN CONVERTED INTO CARBONATE SOME SIMILAR EXPERIMENTS MADE IN THE AMYLSERIES WHICH I SHALL DESCRIBE IN ANOTHER PART OF THIS PAPER HAVE BEEN ATTENDED WITH MORE SUCCESS FROM THESE EXPERIMENTS IT MAY BE INFERRED BY ANALOGY THAT THE RESIDUE REMAINING ON EVAPORATING A SOLUTION OF OXIDE OF TETRETHYLAMTNONIUM IS THE HYDRATE C4 H5 C4 H5 NO

DEGREES PERFECTLY VOLATILIZED IF THIS PROCESS BE CON DUCTED IN AN APPROPRIATE APPARATUS IT IS FOUND THAT THE BASE UNDER THESE CIRCUM STANCES YIELDS THREE PRODUCTS OF DECOMPOSITION NAMELY WATER AN HIGHLY ALKALINE OIL RATHER SOLUBLE IN WATER AND A COLOURLESS INFLAMMABLE GAS THE OILY BASE HAS ALL THE PROPERTIES OF TRIETHYLAMINE IT WAS IDENTIFIED MOREOVER BY THE ANALYSIS OF ITS CHARACTERISTIC

INTERESTING AS AN ADDITIONAL CORROBORATION OF THE FORMULA OF THE BASE BUT LIKEWISE AS AFFORDING A NEW SOURCE FROM WHICH TRIETHYLAMINE MAY BE OBTAINED IN A STATE OF PERFECT PURITY FOR AS I SHALL SHOW PRESENTLY THE OXIDE MAY BE ALSO PREPARED FROM VERY IMPURE MIXTURES OF THE LOWER ETHYLBASES AND EVEN FROM AMMONIA DIRECTLY THIS TOO DESERVES TO BE NOTICED AS A NEW INSTANCE OF THE FAILURE OF THE ANALOGY BETWEEN IODIDE AND OXIDE OF ETHYL ETHERA FACT WHICH WAS POINTED OUT LONG AGO BY MM LAURENT AND GERHARDT AND MOST INDUBITABLY DEMONSTRATED BY THE RECENT INVESTIGATIONS OF DR WILLIAMSON IF THE DECOMPOSITION BY HEAT OF OXIDE OF TETRE THYLAMMONIUM WAS PERFECTLY ANALOGOUS TO THAT OF THE IODIDE WE SHOULD EXPECT TO SEE THE FORMER SPLIT INTO TRIETHYLAMINE AND OXIDE OF ETHYL ETHER C4 H5I C4 ILS

THESE SALTS ARE EXTREMELY SOLUBLE AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE CARBONATE DELIQUESCENT AND BUT LITTLE ADAPTED TO ANALYSIS THEY MAY BE OBTAINED EITHER BY DIRECTLY SATURATING THE OXIDE WITH THE RESPECTIVE ACIDS OR BY DOUBLE DECOMPOSITION THE PHOSPHATE IS CONVENIENTLY PREPARED BY GENTLY HEATING A SOLU TION OF THE IODIDE WITH AN EXCESS OF PHOSPHATE OF SILVER WHEN ACCORDING TO THE SILVER SALT

FOUR DISTINCT GROUPS OF ORGANIC BASES OF THESE THE MEMBERS OF THREE GROUPS CORRESPOND ING TO AMMONIA H3 N ARE VOLATILE WHILE THOSE OF THE FOURTH CORRESPONDING TO OXIDE OF AMMONIUM H4 N 0 CANNOT BE

FORMER GROUP AS IT WERE THE CONNECTING LINK BETWEEN THE VOLATILE AND THE NONVOLATILE ORGANIC ALKALOIDS I AM INCLINED TO ATTACH SOME IMPORTANCE TO THE LATTER POINT FOR THE AC QUISITION OF A GENERAL METHOD BY MEANS OF WHICH WE MAY RISE FROM THE VOLATILE TO THE NONVOLATILE BASES IS NOT UNLIKELY TO PAVE THE WAY TO THE ARTIFICIAL PRODUCTION OF THE FIXED NATIVE ALKALOIDS WHOSE CONSTITUTION IS STILL SHROUDED IN DARKNESS WE MAY HERE REMIREMBER THAT A VERY CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF THESEFIXED NATIVE ALKALOIDS YIELD VOLATILE ORGANIC BASES WHEN SUBMITTED TO THE ACTION OF HEAT OR OF POTASSATHAT IS UNDER

TRANSFBRMNATION BEING IN MOST OF THESE CASES ACCOMPLISHED SIDE BY SIDE A CERTAIN ANALOGY HOWEVER CANNOT POSSIBLY BE DENIED ALTHOUGH ON ACCOUNT OF THE MORE COMPLICATED FORMULTE OF THE NATIVE BASES IT CANNOT AS YET BE TRACED IN SIMPLE EQUATIONS IN SOME INSTANCES THE CONNECTION EVEN NOW APPEARS ALMOST PALPABLE IF WE COMPARE THE FORMULAE OF QUININE AND OF LEUCOLINE THE VOLATILE BASE DERIVED FRIOM ITS

EXPECT THAT THE ACTION OF IODIDE OF METHYL UPON LEUCOLINE AND THE SUBSEQUENT DECOMPOSITION OF THE IODIDE PRODUCED BY MEANS OF PROTOXIDE OF SILVER WOULD ENABLE US TO RECONVERT LEUCOLINE IN THIS MANNER INTO QUININE THIS METAMORPHOSIS WOULD BE THE MORE INTERESTING AS IT WOULD OPEN A SOURCE FOR THE ARTI FICIAL PRODUCTION OF QUININE LEUCOLINE BEING AS IS WELL KNOWN CONTAINED IN CONSI DERABLE QUANTITY IN THE BASIC PORTION OF COALTAR NAPHTHA IT MAY BE STATED HERE THAT LEUCOLINE WHICH IS A SUBSTANCE REMARKABLE FOR ITS ANTIPATHY TO THE CRYSTALLINE FORM WHEN SUBMITTED TO THE ACTION OF IODIDE OF METHYL SOLIDIFIES AT ONCE INTO A SPLENDID MASS OF CRYSTALS OF A NEW IODIDE WHICH IN FACT RESEMBLES IN ITS OUTWARD APPEARANCE HYDRIODATE OF QUININE AND WHICH IS STILL UNDER EXAMINATION I AM HOWEVER BY NO MEANS SANGUINE AS TO THE RESULT OF THIS EXPERIRNENT FOR THE ABOVE PLAY OF FORMULAE RESTS AS YET ON A VERY PRECARIOUS FOUNDATION NEITHER THE FORMULA OF QUININE TIOR THAT OF LEUCOLINE BEING ESTABLISHED BEYOND A DOUBT NEVERTHELESS I INTEND TO COMPLETE THIS INVESTIGATION BECAUSE EVEN IF NO OTHER RESULT IS OBTAINED YET BY MEANS OF THIS PROCESS NEW DATA FOR ULTIMATELY FIXING THE FORMNULAE OF QUININE AND LEUCOLINE MAY BE FOUND IN CONCLUSION IT MAY NOT BE OUT OF PLACE TO CONSIDER HOW FAR THE PRECEDING RESEARCHES AFFECT THE RECEIVED VIEWS REGARDING THE CONSTITUTION OF THE AMMONIA SALTS WITHOUT REPRODUCING ALL THE ARGUMNENTS BROUGHT FORWARD BY THE SUPPORTERS OF THE VARIOUS THEORIES WE MAY REMEMBER THAT IRRESPECTIVELY OF THE IMRPOSSIBILITY OF ISOLATING AMMONIUM ITSELF THE INSTABILITY OF ITS OXIDE HAS BEEN ADDUCED AS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT OBJECTIONS AGAINST THE ASSUMPTION OF THE AMLLMONIUIMTHEORY AS ORI GINALLY SUGGESTED BY AMPBRE AND SUBSEQTLENTLY ELABORATED BY BERZELIUS IT DESETRVES TO BE NOTICED THAT BERZELIUS EXPRESSLY STATES THAT HE CONSIDERS THE SOLUTION OF ARM MONIAGAS IN WATER AS A SOLUTION OF THE HYDRATED OXIDE OF AMNMONIUM THIS IDEA WHICH IS BUT A LOGICAL CONCLUSION FIOM THE GENERALIZATION OF THE FACTS IS DISCOUNTENANCED TO A CERTAIN EXTENT BY THE CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL CHARACTER OF THIS SOLUTION EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT EVEN AT THE COMMTON TEMPERATURE THIS LIQUID SPLITS AGAIN INTO WATER AND AMMONIA WHILE IT STILL EXHIBITS THE CHARACTER OF THE LATTER IN SO MARKED A MANNER AS ALMOST TO PRECLUDE THE IDEA THAT IT HAD UNDERGONE AS ESSENTIAL A CHANGE AS THE TRANSFORMATION INTO OXIDE OF AMNMONIUM N ECESSARILY MUST BE UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES SOME INTEREST IS ATTACHED TO THE DISCOVERY OF A SERIES OF CON POUND BASES CORRESPONDING IN THEIR COMPOSITION TO HYDRATED OXIDE OF AMMONIUM  A SIMILAR RESULT IS OBTAINED BY THE ACTION OF IODIDE OF ETHYL UPON CONINE AND NICOTINE 393DR A W HOFMANNS RESEARCHES INTO THE FIOM WHICH THEY DIFFER ONLY BY CONTAINING METHYL ETHYL AND AMYL IN THE PLACE OF HYDROGEN AND EXHIBITING A DEPORTMENT WHICH AGREES MUCH BETTER WITH THE ANTI CIPATED CHARACTER OF SUCH COMPOUNDS AS SUGGESTED BY ANALOGY HERE WE FIND A VERY MARKED DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PROPERTIES OF THE COMPOUND AMMONIA AND THOSE OF THE AMMONIUMOXIDE BELONGING TO IT IN THE LATTER WE OBSERVE NO LONGER ANY FEATURE WHICH COULD POSSIBLY BETRAY THE PRESENCE OF THE FORMER ALL THEIR HABITS VOLATILITY ODOUR TASTE C ARE TOTALLY CHANGED THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS WHICH IS NOT INFERIOR TO THAT BETWEEN AMMONIA AND POTASSA THE SOLUTIONS OF THE NEW OXIDES MAY BE BOILED FOR HOURS WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST QUANTITY OF THE CORRESPOND ING AMMONIA BEING DISENGAGED SEVERAL OF THESE OXIDES CONTAINING MORE OR LESS WATER OF CONSTITUTION OR CRYSTALLIZATION MAY ACTUALLY BE OBTAINED IN THE DRY STATE IT IS EVI DENT THAT THE ARGUMENTS MENTIONED ABOVE AS ADDUCED IN REFUTATION OF THE AMMO NIUMTHEORY CANNOT WELL BE RAISED AGAINST THE COMPOUND AMMONIURNS BUT WHO COULD DENY THE PARALLELISM OF THESE SUBSTANCES WITH THE BERZELIAN TYPEWITH THE OXIDE OF AMMONIUM  AGAIN MANY HAVE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO CONCEIVE THAT IN THE COMBINATION OF ANIM MNONIA WITH HYDROCHLORIC OR HYDROBROMIC ACID THE HYDROGEN OF THE LATTER SHOULD LEAVE TLE CHLORINE AND BROMINE FOR WHICH IT IS KNOWN TO POSSESS SO POWERFUL AN AFFINITY IN ORDER TO UNITE WITH AMMONIA CONVERTING IT INTO AMMONIUM AND THEY WERE THE LESS INCLINED TO ADMIT OF SUCH A DISPOSITION OF THE ELEMENTS AS EVERY DAYS EXPERIENCE SHOWED THAT THE ALLEGED CHLORIDE OR BROMIDE OF AMMONIUM WAS INCAPABLE OF EX CHANGING OXYGEN FOR CHLORINE OR BROMINE WITHOUT LOSING THE ADDITIONAL EQUIVALENT OF HYDROGEN AGAIN IN THE FORM OF WATER IN OTHER TERMS THE DECOMPOSITION OF SALAM MONIAC BY LIME INTO CHLORIDE OF CALCIUM AMMONIAGAS AND WATER INDUCED THEM TO CONSIDER THIS SALT AS A COMPOUND OF AMMONIA AND HYDROCHLORIC ACID FOR IN THE CON CEPTION OF THE AMMONIURNTHEORY WE SHOULD HAVE TO ASSUME IN THIS DECOMPOSI TION TWO CONSECUTIVE CHANGES THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE CHLORIDE INTO OXIDE AND THE SUBSEQUENT SPLITTING OF THE LATTER INTO AMMONIACAL GAS AND WATER I READILY ADMIT THAT THE LATTER VIEW IS LESS SIMPLE BUT I AMR INCLINED TO THINK THAT THIS SLIGHT INCONVENIENCE IS ALTOGIETHER OVERRULED BY THE GENERAL ADVANTAGES OF THE AMMONIURN THEORY ESPECIALLY FOR THE PURPOSES OF INSTRUCTION BY THE FACILITY WITH WHICH IT AC COUNTS FOR ALL PHENOMENA OF TRANSPOSITION AND SUBSTITUTION AND BY THE SIMPLE EXPLA NATION IT GIVES OF THE ISOMORPHISM OF THE POTASSIUM AND AMMONIUMCOMPOUNDS WHICH WILL ALWAYS BE THE FIRMEST FOUNDATION OF THIS THEORY ON THE OTHER HAND WE HAVE TO INQUIRE WHICH OF THE TWO VIEWS COMES NEAREST TO TRUTH AND HERE A COMPARATIVE CONSIDERATION OF THE DEPORTMENT EXHIBITED BY THE COMPOUND AMMONIUMS NMAY BE OF SOME INTEREST IN MANY RESPECTS THEIR PROPERTIES ARE MORE CLEARLY PRONOUNCED AND THEIR BEHAVIOUR IS EXPLICIT AND UNEQUIVOCAL IN THOSE VERY POINTS IN WHICH THE TYPICAL AMMONIUM LEAVES ROOM FOR SPECULATION IN THE COMBINATION OF TRIETHYLAMINE WITH BROMIDE OR IODIDE OF ETHYL IT IS NO LONGER A MATTER OF DOUBT WHETHER THE ETHYL LEAVES THE IODINE IN ORDER TO UNITE MORE INTIMATELY WITH THE TRIETHYLAMINE FOR WE SEE THAT 394MOLECULAR CONSTITUTION OF THE ORGANIC BASES THE NEW IODIDE THUS PRODUCED IS CAPABLE OF EXCHANGING ITS IODINE FOR OXYGEN WITHOUT THE NEWLYFORMED OXIDE SUFFERING IMMEDIATE DECOMPOSITION AS IS THE CASE WITH OXIDE OF AMMONIUM ON THE CONTRARY WE FIND THIS NEW OXIDE ENDOWED WITH REMARK ABLE STABILITY ALTHOUGH UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HEAT IT IS LIABLE TO THE SAME CHANGE WHICH BEFALLS THE OXIDE OF AMMONIUM ITS CORRESPONDING AMMONIA BEING REPRODUCED HERE THEN IN THE DECOMPOSITION OF IODIDE OF TRIETHYLAMMONIUM BY METALLIC OXIDES WE ARE OBLIGED BY IRRESISTIBLE EVIDENCE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THOSE VERY TWO STAGES THE ASSUMPTION OF WHICH IN THE ANALOGOUS CHANGE OF IODIDE OF AMMONIUM APPEARED TO US DEFICIENT IN SIMPLICITY AND PROBABILITY THE CONCEPTION OF AMMONIUM DOES NOT IN ANY WAY IMPLY THE NOTION THAT THE DIFFER ENT HYDROGENATOMS UNITED WITH NITROGEN IN THE MOLECULE OF THE COMPOUND METAL RETAIN THEIR POSITION IN THE MOLECULAR SYSTEM WITH EQUAL PERSISTENCY WE ARE FORCED BY UNEQUIVOCAL FACTS TO ADMIT THAT THE FOURTH ATOM OF HYDROGEN IS IN A PECULIAR STATE OF MOBILITY AND IT IS ON THE FACILITY WITH WHICH THIS FOURTH ATOM IS DISLODGED FROM ITS POSITION THAT ONE OF THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE AMMONIATHEORY RESTS IN THE COMPOUND AMMONIUMS THE MOBILITY OF THE FOURTH ATOM OF HYDROGEN OR THE HYDROCARBON RE PLACING IT STILL PREVAILS ALTHOUGH LESS SO THAN IN THE TYPE ITSELF THE DECOMPOSITION OF THE AMMONIUMBASES UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HEAT IS PARTICULARLY INSTRUCTIVE IN THIS RESPECT OXIDE OF TETRETHYLAMMONIUM LOSES THE FOURTH EQUIVALENT OF ETHYL IN THE FORM OF OLEFIANT GAS AND WATER AND THIS DEPORTMENT MIGHT BE GRAPHICALLY INDICATED BY WRITING THE FORMULA OF THIS COMPOUND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE AMMONIATHEORY NAMELY THUS C4 H5 C H5 NN C4 H5 0 C4 H5J THE IODIDE ACCORDINGLY WOULD BE REPRESENTED BY THE FORMULA C4 H5 C4 H5N C4 H I C4 HJ AN EXPRESSION WHICH IS MOREOVER IN PERFECT LHARMONY WITH THE MODE IN WHICH THIS COMPOUND IS PRODUCED NAMELY BY THE DIRECT UNION OF IODIDE OF ETHYLWITH TRIETHYL AMINE BUT NOW WE COMBINE THE TRIETHYLAMINE WITH IODIDE OF AMYL WHEREBY THE IODIDE C4 H5 N C10 HL I C4 HJ IS FORMED WHICH AS WE HAVE SEEN IN THE PRECEDING PAGES MAY BE CONVERTED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY INTO THE CORRESPONDING OXIDE THIS OXIDE HOWEVER CANNOT POSSIBLY BE CON SIDERED AS C4 H15 C4 H5 N C1O HLL 0 C4 H5J 95DR A  W HOFMANNS RESEARCHES INTO THE FOR THE DISENGAGEMENT OF OLEFIANT GAS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HEAT PROVES TO US THAT IT IS AN ETHYLATOM WHICH IN TTIS COMPOUND OCCUPIES THE SUPPLEMENTAL POSITION IF I MAY SO CALL IT AS REPRESENTED IN THE FORMULA C4 H C4 H5 NC4 H 50 CO HAJ AND THAT THE IODIDE WHICH IS NOT LIKELY TO DIFFER IN ITS CONSTITUTION FROM THE OXIDE HAS LIKEWISE TO BE REPRESENTED BY THE FORMULA C4 H5 CH5 N C4 H5  CLO HNJ C10 LI THE PRECEDING CONSIDERATIONS CLEARLY SHOW THAT WHATEVER THE ACTUAL DISPOSITION OF THE MOLECULES IN AMMONIUM OR ITS CONGENERS MAY BE THE ATOMS REARRANGE THEMSELVES WHENEVER THE FOURTH EQUIVALENT OF HYDROGEN OR OF ITS SUBSTITUTE JOINS THE COMPOUND THIS REARRANGEMENT SO EVIDENT IN THE AMMONIUMBASES CONTAINING VARIOUS HYDRO CARBONS MAY BE TRACED MOREOVER IN THE LOWER ETHYLBASES IN A VERY OBVIOUS MANNER FOR AS LONG AS THERE IS ANY BASIC HYDROGEN PRESENT IN THE AMMONIASKELETON THIS HYDROGEN ASSUMES WHAT I HAVE PREVIOUSLY CALLED THE SUPPLEMENTAL POSITION WHENEVER THE AMMNONIA PASSES INTO THE STATE OF AMMONIUM BY THE ACCESSION OF A RADICAL BROMIDE OF ETHYLAMMONIUM FORMED BY THE COMBINATION OF AMMONIA WITH BROMIDE OF ETHYL WHEN DECOMPOSED BY A METALLIC OXIDE YIELDS ETHYLAMMONIA WATER AND A METALLIC BROMIDE THE OXIDE OF ETHYLAMMONIUM FORMED IN THE FIRST INSTANCE BEING DECOMPOSED LIKE OXIDE OF AMMONIUM ITSELF IT IS THIS VERY TRANSPOSITION WHICH WE ARE IN THE HABIT OF REPRESENTING BY THE EQUATION H3 NC4 115 BRC4 H5 H2 N H BR IN THE PRECEDING PAGES I HAVE STATED SOME OF THE REASONS WHICH INDUCED ME TO ADOPT THE IDEA OF AN AMMONIUM FOR THE NEW CLASS OF COMPOUNDS WHICH I HAVE HAD THE HONOUR TO PLACE BEFORE THE ROYAL SOCIETY IN THE PRESENT MEMOIR I NEED SCARCELY MENTION THAT SUCH A STEP INVOLVES AS A MATTER OF NECESSITY THE ASSUMPTION OF A SIMILAR VIEW FOR ALL THE LOWER BASES WHICH

the Organic Bases By Dr A W HOFMANN FCS Professor of the Royal College of Chemistry of London Second Memoir Communicated by Sir JAMES CLARK Bart FRS Received March 12Read April 3 1851 ABOUT twelve months ago I had the honour of presenting to the Royal Society an account of a series of researches into the mnolecular constitution of the volatile organic bases at present I beg to submit to the consideration of the Society the history of a new group of alkaloids which although intimately connected with the former by their origin differ from them altogether by their properties and especially in not being volatile The members of this new group of alkaloids are so numerous their deportment is so singular and their derivatives raimify in so many directions that I have not as yet been able to complete the study of these substances in all their bearings nor is it my intention to go fully into the chemistry of the subject in the present com nunication my object being merely to establish the existence of these bodies and to give a general outline of their connection with the volatile bases and of their most plominent chemical and physical properties reserving a detailed description of their salts and derivatives to a future memoir In the paper above referred to I advanced the position that the majority of the volatile organic bases might be represented by the general expression x Y N ZJ a formula which coincides with that of ammonia if XYZH I proved by ex periment that the terms X Y and Z may represent not only hydrogen but a variety of hydrocarbons especially the socalled alcoholradicals Cn Hn and endeavoured on the ground of these experiments to classify the volatile organic bases according to the amount of basict hydrogen retained in the several alkaloids I thus arrived at three groups of bases for which in accordance with traditional names I proposed the terms amidogenbases imidogenbases and nitrilebases The ideas enunciated regarding the constitution of the volatile organic bases were it is true to a certain extent the result of theoretical speculation but they were so  Philosophical Transactions Part I 1850 p 93 t Ibid p 111 MDCCCLI 3 ADR A W HOFMANNS RESEARCHES INTO THE perfectly in accordance with all the observations recorded and had been submitted to the test of experiment in so many directions that no doubt was left in my mind regarding their correctness Still the former inquiry had elicited several facts which I was unable to explain by the view which I had taken These facts I have since endeavoured to elucidate by additional experiments the results detailed in the fol lowing pages I am happy to say are in perfect accordance with my former observa tions the extension of which has led me at the same time to a still more general conception of the question After having succeeded in replacing step by step one two or three equivalents of hydrogen in ammonia by a corresponding number of compound atoms the question arose whether the agent by which these changes were affected would exert a still farther influence upon the last product of the reaction In order to decide this ques tion by experiment I submitted two nitrilebases diethylaniline and triethylamine to a prolonged action of bromide of ethyl These experiments of which a full ac count is given in my preceding memoir pages 106 and 122 did not lead to per fectly decisive results It was evident that in these cases a reaction ensued even on using both the base under examination and the bromide in the absolutely dry state a gradual change was observed to take place a small but unmistakeable quantity of hydrobromates being invariably formed No doubt however could be entertained as to this reaction being altogether different from the preceding stages of the process for instance the conversion of ammonia into ethylamine of ethylamine to diethyl amine c it was proved moreover by careful and frequentlyrepeated experiment that this process whatever its nature might be in no case gave rise to the formation of any other volatile bases containing a larger number of replacing radicals than the nitrilebase submitted to investigation I have been again studying these reactions during the past year on a much larger scale whereby the experilnents were greatly facilitated and here I gladly avail my self of an opportunity of expressing my sincere thanks to the Royal Society for the kind and encouraging interest they have taken in this inquiry the new results of which are mainly attributable to their liberal and munificent support ACTION OF BROMIDE AND IODIDE OF ETHYL UPON TRIETHYLAMINE In the paper repeatedly referred to I have stated that a mixture of an aqueous solution of triethylamine and bromide of ethyl sealed up in a tube solidified after several hours ebullition and that the crystals consisted chiefly of the fibrous hydro brotnate of triethylamine with which however a certain quantity of white opake gra nular crystals invariably was mixed I have endeavoured to increase the quantity of the latter by using both the bromide of ethyl and the triethylamnine in the anhydrous state But by thus changing the conditions of the formation the progress of the reaction is retarded in the nmost remarkable manner days elapsing before the con 358MOLECULAR CONSTITUTION OF THE ORGANIC BASES version is completed While engaged in these experiments I found that the result intended may be obtained almost instantaneously by substituting the iodide for the bromide of ethyl and as this observation was immediately followed by a perfect elucidation of the whole question I have scarcely returned again to the use of the bromide On adding perfectly anhydrous iodide of ethyl to triethylamine dried over hydrate of potassa the mixture becomes slightly turbid heat being evolved at the same time At the common temperature the action goes on very gradually and after the lapse of several days the mixture is converted into a solid mass On the other hand if the mixture be exposed for a minute or two to the temperature of boiling water a very powerful reaction ensules the liquid remains even after the removal of the source of heat for some time in a state of lively ebullition and solidifies after cooling into a hard mass of crystals which is snowwhite or of a yellowish tint according as either the triethylamine or the iodide of ethyl has been in excess To avoid losing iodide of ethyl and especially triethylamine which is the result of a long series of troublesome and expensive processes I have usually performed the reaction in strong glass tubes of between three and four feet in length which were sealed before the blowpipe after the substances had been introduced The crystalline mass produced in this reaction readily dissolves even in cold water If the iodide was in excess this substance separates in heavy oily globules which may be readily separated and recovered by distillation and the solution is inodorous and either neutral or very slightly acid in the latter case it has always a marked yellowish tint On the other hand if the base was in excess the solution of the crystals was colourless and alkaline the alkaline reaction disappears however on ebul lition triethylamine being disengaged The crystals are likewise soluble in alcohol but almost insoluble in ether The purification of the crystals is not attended with any difficulties it is in fact sufficient to dissolve them in cold water and to allow the solution to evaporate spon taneously when beautiful welldefined white crystals of considerable size are depo sited which may be easily separated by mechanical means from small quantities of a reddish iodinecompound which is sometimes formed by the action of the air This latter substance is formed in much larger quantity at higher temperatures wherefore it is advisable to avoid the use of boiling water in the purification The crystals are anhydrous when exposed to the temperature of boiling water they exhibit no change in weight When submitted to analysis they gave the follow ing results I 0A4385 grm of substance gave 06015 grm of carbonic acid and 03040 grm of

simply depends upon a direct combination of triethylamine with iodide of ethyl for C2 H15 NC4 H5 IC16 H20 N I LvJ LJ Triethylamine Iodide of New crystalline Ethyl compound In perfect accordance with this formation is the change which the iodinecompound undergoes when subjected to the action of heat when rapidly heated the crystals fuse and are decomposed the products being triethylamine and iodide of ethyl which form two layers in the receiver but rapidly unite again to the original compound In fact this recomnbination takes place to a considerable extent in the neck of the retort so that when first I became acquainted with this substance I was for some time under the impression that the iodinecompound might be volatilized without decomposition I confess I had not anticipated the possibility of the existence of a compound having the above composition it appeared at the first glance in direct opposition to the theoretical view repeatedly referred to For if it was possible to decompose the new iodide by potassa just as the preceding iodides obtained respectively by the ac tion of bromide or iodide of ethyl upon ammonia ethylamine and diethylamine if it was possible to separate from this substance a new volatile base analogous to the preceding ethylated alkaloids there was no reason why the process of ethylation should cease with the fourth equivalent of ethyl On the contrary it then appeared more than probable that the formations of ethylamine diethylamine and triethyl amine far from being due to a successive replacement of the various equivalents of hydrogen in ammonia were rather to be considered as special instances of a far more general tendency of carbon and hydrogen to accumulate in organic substances 360MOLECULAR CONSTITUTION OF THE ORGANIC BASES The eagerness with which I submitted this question to the test of experiment may be readily imagined On adding potassa to a solution of the iodinecompound in water the liquid solidified at once into a crystalline mass which I took of course for the base existing in the iodide analysis however soon showed that the substance thus precipitated is nothing but the iodide itself which is less soluble in an alkaline solution than in pure water In fact Analysis IV was made with a specimen which had thus been treated with potassa The iodide was now distilled with a very concentrated solution of potassa for several hours but during this time nothing but pure water passed over the solution in the retort solidified on cooling to crystals of the unchanged iodide When the solution of the iodide in potassa had become very concenftrated it separated into two layers an aqueous one and an oily one which floated on the surface But even now no decomposition had been induced the oily stratum solidifying on cooling into a crystalline cake of iodide perfectly unaltered It was only when the liquid was evaporated to dryness that a change took place but then the change was no longer due to the action of the potassa but to the influence of heat and in no way differed from the decomposition which the clystals undergo when heated alone The deportment with potassa of the new iodinecompound altogether precludes the idea of considering it as an analogue of the hydriodides of ethylamine diethylamine and tiiethylamine all of which are readily decomposed under the influence of the alkalies However the iodine though it cannot be eliminated from the crystals by the alkalies may be separated with the greatest facility by silversalts in fact the nitrate the sulphate the oxide of silver behave with the iodinecompound exactly as with iodide of potassium or sodium On adding nitrate of silver to a solution of the iodide iodide of silver is at once precipitated and a nitrate remains in solution which on evaporation crystallizes in deliquescent needles With sulphate of silver a perfectly similar change takes place an analogous sulphate remaining in solution During these interchanges the liquids remain perfectly neutral If the solution of the iodide be digested with freshly precipitated protoxide of silver the solution at once assumes a powerfully alkaline reaction iodide of silver being formed the same effect is pro duced by the action of caustic baryta upon the sulphate sulphate of baryta being precipitated These reactions when viewed collectively exhibit a striking analogy between the new iodide and the metallic iodides especially those of the alkalimetals In fact the molecular group combined with iodine in the compound under examina tion behaves like sodium or potassium  it is a true organic metal in all its bearings For this metal I propose on the ground of its formation and composition the name Tetrethylammonium rerpa which implies that it is built up by the intimate union of nitrogen with four equivalents of the hypothetical hydrocarbon called ethyl and that it may be viewed as ammonium in which the whole of the hydrogen is replaced by an equivalent proportion of the above hydrocarbon 361DR A W HOFMANNS RESEARCHES INTO THE Ammonium Tetrethylammonium Hf C H4 N C 5 NC16H2o N HJ C4 H5 HIj C4 nHj The new crystalline compound according to this mode of viewing it must be con sidered as iodide of tetrethylammonium and its formation takes place in conse quence of a transposition of the elements which is perfectly analogous to that assumed by the followers of the ammoniumtheory in the formation of iodide of ammonium from ammonia and hydriodic acid BH  3 H1 H N H I H N I H H C4H5 1 H5 c41H1 H5JNC41 C4H5  C4Hs5NC4Hs 4 IN 1 C4 H5 C4 H J I will not enter here into the merits of the ammoniumtheory the question whether this mode of representing the constitution of the ammoniasalts be correct or not may be left out of consideration for the present The view I have taken of the new compound and which I readily admit must stand and fall with the ammo niumtheory has the great advantage of closely assimilating these substances to the compounds of mineral chemistry whereby the nomenclature is essentially facilitated I will now proceed to give a sketch of the tetrethylammoniumcompounds as far as this is necessary in order to convey a clear perception of the character and the peculiarities of this group of bodies I reserve a detailed account of the derivatives of this group to a special memoir in which I intend to give moreover a fuller de scription of diethylamine and triethylamine which were only briefly noticed in my former paper Among the various substances derived from the new iodide the corresponding oxide the compound corresponding to oxide of arnmonium attracted my attention in a preeminent degree Oxide of Tetrethylammonium I have already briefly stated how this substance is prepared on decomposing the iodide with an excess of sulphate of silver a sulphate is obtained from which sul phuric acid and excess of silver may be separated by baryta This was in fact the first process by which I separated the base it is however difficult to obtain the solution in this manner free from either baryta or sulphuric acid nor have I ever 362MOLECULAR CONSTITUTION OF THE ORGANIC BASES used this process again after I had found that digestion with freshly precipitated protoxide of silver produces at once the same effect The oxide is added in smalt proportions to the solution of the iodide which is gently heated it is immediately converted into yellow iodide of silver which assumes a white colour on stirring as long as any undecomposed iodide is in solution Gradually the yellow colour be comes permanent and the decomposition is complete as soon as an excess of un changed oxide becomes perceptible by its colour On filtering off the silverprecipitate a clear and colourless liquid is obtained which contains the isolated base in solution It is of a powerfully alkaline reaction which manifests itself not only in its deportment with vegetable colours but also in its possessing the pungent bitterness of quinine the solution when strongly con centrated not only burns the tongue but it acts upon the epidermis which it de stroys like caustic potassa or soda On rubbing a solution of the oxide between the fingers the wellknown sensation produced by the fixed alkalies under the same cir cumstances is felt and we perceive moreover the same peculiar odour Oxide of tetrethylammonium saponifies the fats as readily as potassa The expe riment was made with cocoanut oil which after half an hours ebullition with the new alkali was converted into a beautiful soft soap having the appearance of an ordinary potassasoap This soap washes very well I have traced the analogy of the new body with potassa in many other directions Chemists recollect the remarkable effect produced by ebullition with potassa in cer tain nitrogenous substances It was by this process that Dr FOWNES the discoverer of this reaction converted furfuramide into the isomneric alkaloid furfurine I found that boiling with oxide of tetrethylammonium effects this molecular change as rapidly as potassa Like potassa it decomposes oxalic ether into oxalic acid and alcohol and evolves ammonia fiom ammoniasalts even in the cold It may be substituted for potassa in TRoMMERs wellknown sugartest Coppersolutions mixed with either cane or grapesugar yield on addition of oxide of tetrethylammonium a lightblue precipi tate of the hydrate of the protoxide which redissolves in an excess of the base forming a deep blue solution with a shade of green on ebullition the canesugar solution deposits a greenish precipitate which is only slowly and always very incom pletely converted into suboxide of copper In the presence of grapesugar the reduction ensues instantaneously on application of heat The reactions of the new base with metallic oxides assimilate this compound as nearly as possible to the fixed caustic alkalies The following table exhibits the re actions of this body fWhite precipitate of the hydrate of the earth insoluble in

the base exhibit the same reactions with potassa and oxide of tetrethylammonium Although I did not anticipate great results from the experiment I have submitted the new base to the action of the galvanic current the pile being disposed as in BERZELIUSS original experiment on the formation of the ammoniumamalgam 364MOLECULAR CONSTITUTION OF THE ORGANIC BASES However no phenomenon other than the decomposition of water was observed This decomposition certainly appeared to be facilitated especially if the base was employed in the form of sulphate Nor had potassiumamalgam the slightest effect upon oxide of tetrethylammonium I must still mention a peculiar reaction somewhat singular at the first glance which takes place on adding the concentrated oxide to alkaline solutions of iodide of potassium when the crystalline iodide of tetrethylammonium is at once precipitated I need scarcely remark that this phenomenon is due to the insolubility of the iodide in alkaline solutions and not to the new base possessing a greater affinity for iodine than potassium whose oxide is thus actually liberated A moderately concentrated solution of oxide of tetrethylammonium may be boiled without alteration it is only in a very advanced stage of evaporation that decompo sition gradually sets in The change occurs even in the waterbath as soon as the base becomes nearly dry On evaporating however under the bell of the airpump in the presence of sulphuric acid and lime the base may be obtained in the dry state I have endeavoured to obtain it in this manner in a condition fit for analysis but all my attempts have been hitherto in vain a concentrated solution of the oxide when placed in a vacuum deposits after some days exposure long hairlike needles which are however deliquescent in the extreme and attract carbonic acid with great avidity In both respects they are scarcely inferior to potassa By remaining longer in vacuo these crystals disappear again and the whole liquid dries up to a semisolid mass which also deliquesces rapidly and becomes carbonated on exposure to the air As there was not the slightest chance of getting this substance into a combustiontube I endeavoured to ascertain its composition by decomposing a known quantity of the iodide with protoxide of silver evaporating in vacuo in a glass dish which on removing frotn the airpump could be covered with a glass plate and determining the weight of the solid mass remaining These experiments however have not led to any decisive results Soon after the formation of the crystals the liquid becomes coated with a thin pellicle which retards the evaporation to such an extent that even after a fortnights exposure the mass still continues to lose in weight but by that time however carefully the air was excluded the base has partly been converted into carbonate Some similar experiments made in the amylseries which I shall describe in another part of this paper have been attended with more success From these experiments it may be inferred by analogy that the residue remaining on evaporating a solution of oxide of tetrethylamtnonium is the hydrate C4 H5 C4 H5 NO HO C4 H5 corresponding to hydrate of potassa The hairlike crystals contain evidently in MDCCCLI 3 365DR A W HOFMANNS RESEARCHES INTO THE addition several equivalents of water of crystallization they may possibly be analo gous to the wellknown crystallized hydrate of potassa KO HO14 Aq which is formed at low temperatures It was above stated that the residuary substance left on evaporating a solution of the oxide of tetrethylammonium is decomposed even at the temperature of boiling water During this change a powerful ammoniacal odour is evolved the substance strongly intumesces and is by degrees perfectly volatilized If this process be con ducted in an appropriate apparatus it is found that the base under these circum stances yields three products of decomposition namely water an highly alkaline oil rather soluble in water and a colourless inflammable gas The oily base has all the properties of triethylamine it was identified moreover by the analysis of its characteristic platinumsalt 02257 grm of platinumsalt gave on ignition 00725 grm of platinum Theoretical percentage Experimental percentage Platinum  3212 32 12 The inflammable gas evolved was pure olefiant gas it was perfectly absorbed by bromine water proving the absence of hydrocarbons not belonging to the family Cn H and the oily liquid formed had all the properties of the Dutch liquid It readily solidified into a crystalline mass when exposed to a freezing mixture a de portment whereby the olefiant gas compound may be easily distinguished from the corresponding compounds of propylene butylene and amylene Hence the metamorphosis of oxide of tetrethylammonium under the influence of heat is represented by the following equation C4 51 pr 4 C4 Ha NO HO2HO C4 H NCH4 C4 H51 This change is not only interesting as an additional corroboration of the formula of the base but likewise as affording a new source from which triethylamine may be obtained in a state of perfect purity for as I shall show presently the oxide may be also prepared from very impure mixtures of the lower ethylbases and even from ammonia directly This too deserves to be noticed as a new instance of the failure of the analogy between iodide and oxide of ethyl ethera fact which was pointed out long ago by MM LAURENT and GERHARDT and most indubitably demonstrated by the recent investigations of Dr WILLIAMSON If the decomposition by heat of oxide of tetre thylammonium was perfectly analogous to that of the iodide we should expect to see the former split into triethylamine and oxide of ethyl ether C4 H5I C4 ils

of ether water and olefiant gas I have prepared several of the salts of tetrethylammonium The sulphate the nitrate the phosphate the carbonate the hydrochorate and the hydrobromate all crystallize But these salts are extremely soluble and with the exception of the carbonate deliquescent and but little adapted to analysis They may be obtained either by directly saturating the oxide with the respective acids or by double decomposition The phosphate is conveniently prepared by gently heating a solu tion of the iodide with an excess of phosphate of silver when according to the silver salt employed either the common phosphate or the pyrophosphate c may be ob tained The phosphate thus obtained is strongly alkaline like the tribasic soda salt Tetrethylammonium forms a great number of beautiful double salts of which I have examined a few PlatinumsaltOn adding a solution of bichloride of platinum to the chloride an orangeyellow precipitate appears at once which in every respect resembles the corresponding potassium or ammoniumcompound Like the latter it is slightly soluble in water and less so in alcohol and in ether like the latter it may be crystallized in beautiful

and V simply by removing the iodine from the iodide by nitrate of silver acidifying with hydrochloric acid and adding bichloride of platinum to the mixture of nitrate and chloride thus obtained The

additional elucidation to the subject I have omitted to study them in detail The action of various chemical agents upon the compounds of tetrethylarnmnonium gives rise to a series of very remarkable substances Chlorine bromine and iodine convert the base into substitutionproducts in which the basic character of the ori ginal atom has disappeared of these the brominecompound is distinguished by its splendid appearance crystallizing as it does from alcohol in long magnificent orange yellow needles The iodinecompound too is very beautiful it forms either on addi tion of iodinesolution to the base or on evaporating a solution of the iodide exposed to the action of the air In fact it is difficult to avoid the formation of this substance in recrystallizing iodide of tetrethylammonium Cyanic acid yields with the base a crystalline compound a sort of urea which is remarkable for its composition inas much as it may be viewed as ordinary urea in which the four equivalents of hydrogen are replaced by ethyl I hope to communicate shortly a full account of these several substances The preceding sketch incomplete as it is sufficiently exhibits the leading features of the new class of substances of which tetrethylammonium and its compounds are the prototypes It is at once evident that there is a marked difference between these latter and the bases which I have described in my former memoir Irrespectively of the nonvolatility of the new basic oxide which forms in itself a line of demarcation there are many other properties not less distinctive which attract our attention The consecutive replacement of the several hydrogenequivalents of ammonia induces a gradual change in the properties of the original atom ethylamine is almost as soluble in water as ammonia itself in diethylamine this property is less marked and finally triethylamine is still less soluble But another equivalent of ethyl being added the substance changes altogether in property it becomes soluble in water in all propor tions in fact so soluble that it can scarcely be obtained in the dry state A perfectly analogous although reverse deportment is exhibited by the platinumsalts of the various bases here we find that the solubility of the salts augments with the degree of ethylation the salt of triethylamine being soluble in the extreme while suddenly the tetrethylammoniumcompound becomes not more soluble than the ammnonium compound itself It is evident that ethylamine diethylamine and triethylamine are compound ammonias the tetrethylated base is a compound oxide of ammoniumMOLECULAR CONSTITUTION OF THE ORGANIC BASES It now remained only to submit the new base again to the action of iodide of ethyl An experiment on a small scale showed that the two compounds do not fail to act promptly upon one another The mixture after an hours ebullition in a sealed tube solidified into a beautiful crystalline mass In order to obtain a precise notion of this reaction I repeated this experiment upon a grand scale Two ounces of iodide of tetrethylammonium were caustified by protoxide of silver and then submitted to the action of about half a pound of iodide of ethyl The mixture was kept boiling in a glass flask provided with a long tube in which the volatilized substances were con densed and returned to the seat of the reaction During the whole process not a trace of permanent gas was disengaged After a days ebullition the solution had become neutral and deposited on cooling magnificent crystals of iodide of tetrethylammonium which were identified by analysis In fact for the determinations III and V men tioned at the analysis of the platinumcompound the salts had been prepared with the base obtained in this manner On submitting the motherliquor of the crystals to distillation in such a manner as to collect only the most volatile products a con siderable amount of perfectly pure alcohol was obtained which was identified by a careful comparison of all its properties The action of iodide of ethyl upon oxide of tetrethylammonium is therefore represented by the following equation C4 H51 C4 H5 C4H5 N O HOC4 IC4 H5 O HO C4 H5 N I C4 H5J C4 H5 I have since found that metallic oxides such as protoxide of silver in the presence of water all exert the same action on iodide of ethyl in this case a metallic iodide is formed alcohol being reproduced The experiment just described shows that as might have been expected the ethylation cannot be carried on ad infinitum and that the oxide of tetrethylammo nium is the highest termn attainable in the ethylseries The latter substance con tinues to act upon iodide of ethyl but the change affects solely the iodide of ethyl while the base is no longer altered The preceding researches are in themselves sufficient to establish the point of theory which is here in question still I hoped to gain a broader basis for raising general conclusions by collecting some additional facts The repetition in the methyl or amylseries of an experiment already made in the ethylseries resembles it is true the working of a design in blue or green which has been previously printed in red Nevertheless irrespectively of the farther elaboration of the theory of homo logues which is still wanted such experiments lead frequently to new and unex pected observations which often amply repay the trouble and tediousness of such inquiries I therefore made the experiments which yielded the following results 371DR A W HOFMANNS RESEARCHES INTO THE ACTION OF IODIDE OF METHYL UPON TRIETHYLAMINE A mixture of triethylamine and iodide of methyl solidifies after some time to a crystalline mass even at the common temperature On ebullition the change takes place instantaneously The crystalline compound thus produced may be viewed as the iodide of an organic metal containing together with nitrogen one equivalent of methyl and three of ethyl 4H5  f C4 H51 C4H5 CI4 H3 In accordance with the nomenclature I have proposed for the preceding substance this compound may be called iodide of methylotriethylammonium And here is perhaps the place to ask for indulgence for the sesquipedalia verba which I am using in the account of this investigation and of which the worst I fear are still to come However the use of these barbarous names has the advantage of convey ing an idea of the composition of the substances under examination in the shortest and most impressive manner Moreover none of these names are likely to remain in science all these substances which are prepared solely for the elucidation of a prin ciple will be forgotten as soon as the object is gained they resemble pavingstones each of which is very important in laying down a street though no interest is at tached to the blocks themselves as soon as we are passing along the level road Iodide of methylotriethylammonium has all the properties which I have enume rated when speaking of the preceding compound It is extremely soluble forming a perfectly neutral very bitter solution On adding potassa to this solution a heavy oily liquid is precipitated which gradually solidifies This is the unchanged iodide which like the corresponding tetrethylammoniumcompound is less soluble in alka line solutions than in water The iodide is readily decomposed by protoxide of silver whereby the oxide is obtained in solution which is caustic and bitter in the extreme In vacuo it dries up to a crystalline compound analogous to oxide of tetrethylainmo nium the properties of which present the same difficulties to analysis I have fixed the composition of this compound by the analysis of the beautiful platinumnprecipi tate which is formed on adding the bichloride to a solution of the base saturated with hydrochloric acid 03530 grm of

minutely it forms crystalline salts with sul phuric nitric oxalic and hydrochloric acids ACTION OF IODIDE OF AMYL UPON TRIETHYLAMINE The experiment was conducted in a perfectly similar manner and the results ob tained are perfectly analogous The action however is by no means as rapid as in the preceding cases the amylsubstances being invariably much more inert than the cor responding terms in the ethyl and methylseries In order to complete the process it is necessary to heat the mixture in sealed tubes for two or three days The iodide of amylotriethylammonium for this is the new compound forms remarkably fine crystals which exhibit the fatty lustre and touch peculiar to the amylcompounds It is ex tremely soluble in water and alcohol insoluble in ether The solutions have the bitter taste of quinine On adding potassa or carbonate of potassa the iodide sepa rates as an oil which rapidly shoots into brilliant needles The salt when slightly moist fuses at 1000 C to a clear oily liquid which

The percentage of the platinum is unusually low when compared with the theore tical value a fact which I suppose is due to the recrystallization of the salt In several cases I have observed that the platinumsalts of these bases undergo a slight decomposition under these circumstances which is not indicated by the appearance of the riecrystallized salt but whichl is invariably pointed out by a diminution of the amount of platinum I am not as yet acquainted with the mode of this change In the present instance I have not repeated the experiment because the mode of form ation the analysis of the iodide and moreover the decomposition of the base preclude all doubts respecting the formula of the compound under examination The remarkable change exhibited by oxide of tetrethylaminonium when submitted to the action of heat necessarily induced me to study the deportment of the amylo triethylated base under similar circumstances This study appeared to promise some farther revelations respecting the molecular constitution of this body a hope in which I was not deceived I had no doubt in my mind that the process alluded to would give rise to the formation of a nitrilebase but there were two alternatives which presented themselves as to the nature of this base The question arose Will an equi valent of ethyl or amyl be broken up in this decomposition This question had to be decided by experiment 374MOLECULAR CONSTITUTION OF THE ORGANIC BASES ACTION OF HEAT ON OXIDE OF AMYLOTRIETHYLAMMONIUM Oxide of amylotriethylammonium when subjected to distillation begins to froth as soon as the solution becomes concentrated after which decomposition rapidly sets in The products of this decomposition are water an oily substance and a trans parent inflammable gas The latter by the method I have indicated when speaking of the decomposition of oxide of tetrethylammonium was proved to be perfectly pure olefiant gas when the composition of the oily liquid was no longer doubtful It was evident that this substance must be a nitrilebase containing two equivalents of ethyl and one equivalent of amyl C4 HS C4 H5  C4 H5 1NO HO 2HO  C H NC4 H5 NC4  C4 H rNOH Cllo Hl11 Experiment has

number the boilingpoint of diethylamnylamine should be 575 X 19 152 The experimental boilingpoint is 154 Having seen by the preceding experiments that ethyl as it were yields its place to amyl the idea naturally suggested itself to inquire into the mutual relations of ethyl and methyl under similar circumstances For this purpose I might have studied the action of heat upon oxide of methylotriethylammonium howvever as I had sorne grammes of diethylanylamine at my disposal I preferred to methylate this compound and examine the new body thus obtained ACTION OF IODIDE OF METHYL UPON DIETHYLAMYLAMINE On adding iodide of methyl to diethylamylamine the phenomena which I have already several times described are repeated in turn The action in this case however is so violent that the iodide must be added very gradually for on suddenly mixing the liquid is projected from the vessel with a sort of explosion on account of the low boilingpoint of the methylcompound it is advisable to mix in a tubulated retort pro vided with a condenser On cooling the mixture solidifies into a hard white crystalline mass consisting of a new iodide for which in accordance with the nomenclature which I have adopted I propose the name iodide of methylodiethylamylammonium CC2 H3q C4 5 C H C H NC2 H3 I 45 NI C4 HllJ C  4 C 5 C10 H 113 KC0 HllJ The new iodide like the preceding analogues is extremely

substance thle existence of which is still very problematical Methylethylamylamine is a transparent oil of a fragrant odour and an analogous taste Both these properties are much more marked than those of diethylamylamine which it resembles in most respects It is somewhat more soluble in water than the latter and of a more decided alkaline character When dried over potassa and rec tified the new base boils constantly at 135 Hence its boilingpoint is 15413519 lower than that of diethylamylamine a difference whicli is in perfect accordance with H KoPPs rule Methylethylamylamine dissolves but slowly in the acids forming salts which re semble those of the diethylamylated bases The hydrochlorate gives with bichloride of platinum a beautiful double salt which is extremely soluble in water It

action of iodide of methyl of ethyl or of amyl In order to establish this point I had to return once more to the anilineseries ACTION OF IODIDE OF ETHYL UPON DIETHYLANILINE In my former paper I have recorded a few experiments on the action of bromide of ethyl upon diethylaniline The results unintelligible to me at that period are now perfectly clear I have since repeated these reactions substituting the iodide for the bromide on account of its more prompt action Diethylaniline is perfectly soluble in iodide of ethyl on exposing the mixture sealed in tubes to the temperature of boiling water the liquid column gradually separates into two layers the lower one increasing in bulk with the time of exposure and solidifying on cooling into a semi solid crystalline mass The reaction is terminated when after half a days ebullition the volume of the lower layer which is the new iodide in the fused state ceases to increase The mixture is now distilled with water in order to separate an excess of either diethylaniline or iodide of ethyl when a strongly acid solution of iodide of phenylo triethylammonium is obtained which usually contains a small quantity of hydriodate of diethylaniline as may be inferred from the oily precipitate produced in the solu tion by potassa which does not redissolve on addition of more water Digestion with protoxide of silver separates the two bases one of which diethyl aniline being insoluble in water remains mixed with the oxide and iodide of silver the other the oxide of phenylotriethylammonium forming a powerfully alkaline solu tion

of the requisite purity The solution of this mixture deposits on cooling magnificent dazzlingwhite hard flat needles sometimes of an inch in length which are very difficultly soluble in cold water and may be obtained in the state of purity by washing with cold and recrystallizing from boiling water These crystals are the iodide of tetramethylammonium all the other salts remaining in the

material the boilingpoint could not be determined with accuracy Diamylamine forms very beautiful crystalline salts with the acids which are all rather insoluble in water The hydrochlorate is almost insoluble in cold water but may be recrystallized from boiling water This solution yields with bichloride of platinum a double salt which is rather soluble and separates frequently in the first

two or three days ebullition to a solid somewhat fatlike mass of iodide of tetramylammonium A similar effect is produced by boiling an excess of iodide of amyl with a concentrated solution of ammonia This reaction however takes place very slowly in fact the diminution of affinities chlaracterizing the amylcompounds in general was in none of these cases more marked After two or three days ebullition the volume of the ether appeared scarcely diminished but then a gradual change occurred the heavy amylcompound rising and floating upon the solution of the new iodide which was formed After a fortnights ebullition the aqueous layer began to solidify when allowed to cool but even after keeping the mixture for a period of three weeks in ebullition on opening the boilertube the reaction was found to be far from complete The semisolid mixture thus obtained was subjected to distillation first alone in order to recover the iodide of amyl not acted upon then with potassa to separate ammonia and the lower amylbases The alkaline liquid contained a small quantity of iodide of tetramylammonium in solution which crystallized on cooling in fatlike leaves the larger quantity however of this substance collected at the bottom of the vessel in form of a heavy oil which solidified on cooling to a hard mass of the appearance of stearin The new iodide resembles in its general properties the corresponding compounds I have previously described Like them it is soluble but only with difficulty in water forming a most intensely bitter liquid and reprecipitated from this solution in the

less soluble in water than the corresponding bases in the methyl and ethylseries It would almost appear as if this compound stood to the methyl and ethylbases as an alkaline earth does to potassa and soda On adding potassa to a solution of oxide of tetramylamnmonium the base rises in the form of an oily layer on the surface of the liquid The same separation is ob served when the solution is much evaporated in the latter case the oily layer gradu ally solidifies On allowing a moderately concentrated solution of this base to stand for sometime in a vessel in which it is protected from carbonic acid magnificent perfectly definite crystals sometimes an inch in length and in thickness are de posited they are but moderately deliquescent and attract but slowly carbonic acid from the air These crystals are the hydrate of tetramylammonium containing a certain amount of water of crystallization I have not yet been able to determine the number of equivalents On heating these crystals they fuse in their water of crystallization and yield on evaporation in the waterbath a viscid semisolid trans parent mass which is the hydrated oxide of tetramylammonium Clo0 Hll Clo Hll c10 HnJ This substance is extremely deliquescent and opposes to an ordinary analysis the same obstacles which I met with in the case of tetrethylammonium I succeeded however in the following manner in determining with tolerable accuracy the compo sition of this mass Having observed that this oxide is far less easily decomposed by heat than the corresponding ethylcompound I endeavoured to determine the state of hydration in which the oxide remained by decomposing a known quantity of the iodide with protoxide of silver and evaporating the solution thus obtained in a glass vessel through which a current of air previously dried and decarbonated by potassa 388MOLECULAR CONSTITUTION OF THE ORGANIC BASES was passed at the temperature of boiling water On weighing the residue the amount of water retained by the oxide was given The results obtained in this way although not perfectly accurate on account of the oxide yielding a small quantity of triamyla mine even at 100 before the last traces of water of crystallization are expelled nevertheless leave but little doubt respecting the nature of the residue In an ex periment of this kind 10610 grm of iodide of tetramylammonium left 08000 grin of residue This corresponds to 7543 per cent if the viscid residue had been the pure mono hydrated oxide I should have found 7410 per cent I hope to repeat this experinient at a lower temperature and also to determine the amount of water of crystallization in the crystallized compound the latter is soon reproduced on adding again a moderate quantity of water to the viscid hydrate I have just now mentioned that the oxide when heated in the waterbath yields a small quantity of triamylamine At a higher temperature this reaction proceeds with perfect regularity an inflammable carbohydrlogen being disengaged together with the base There can be scarcely any doubt that the former is amylene This sub stance boils at a rathet low temperature 39 and was therefore partly collected as gas Another portion however dissolved in the triamylanine from which it was ex pelled by ebullition after the base had been fixed by addition of hydrochloric acid Ihe analysis of the triamylamine obtained in this reaction has been mentioned at page 386 Hence the decomposition of oxide of tetramylammonium is perfectly ana logous to that of its analogues in the ethylseries and is represented by the equation C0

iC2 C tcDR A W HOFMANNS RESEARCHES INTO THE The preceding researches show that the action of the bromides and iodides of the alcoholradicals upon ammonia gives rise to the formation of not less than four distinct groups of organic bases Of these the members of three groups correspond ing to ammonia H3 N are volatile while those of the fourth corresponding to oxide of ammonium H4 N 0 cannot be volatilized without decomposition The facility with which the members of this last class arise from those of the preceding ones and the readiness with which their reconversion is effected renders the former group as it were the connecting link between the volatile and the nonvolatile organic alkaloids I am inclined to attach some importance to the latter point for the ac quisition of a general method by means of which we may rise from the volatile to the nonvolatile bases is not unlikely to pave the way to the artificial production of the fixed native alkaloids whose constitution is still shrouded in darkness We may here remirember that a very considerable number of thesefixed native alkaloids yield volatile organic bases when submitted to the action of heat or of potassathat is under precisely those conditions under which the new ammnoniumcompounds which I have described in this paper are converted into conjugate ammonias Thus quinine cinchonine strychnine and pelosine yield among their products of decomposition leucoline chinoline while piperine gives picoline  and morphine caffeine co deine and narcotine have actually been converted into alcoholbases the former yielding methylamine the latter two propylamine I readily admit that those processes are by no means so simple as the passage of oxide of tetrethylammlonium into triethylamine several processes of transfbrmnation being in most of these cases accomplished side by side A certain analogy however cannot possibly be denied although on account of the more complicated formulte of the native bases it cannot as yet be traced in simple equations In some instances the connection even now appears almost palpable If we compare the formulae of quinine and of leucoline the volatile base derived friom its destruction we are surprised to find that these substances exhibit the same elementary difference which we ob serve between oxide of tetramnethylammtonium and methylamine  M WERTHEIM the discoverer of this base believes that it stands to the unknown propylalcohol in the same relation which exists between mnethylamine ethylatinine and amylamine on the one hand and methylic ethylic and amylic alcohol on the other It deserves however to be noticed that the formula C6 H9 N for this compound as determined by experiment expresses not only propylamine but also trimethylamine and even methylethylamine f H 1C2 H3 J H 1 C6H N H N1 Ca H N C N C6 H7J IC2 H C H5J In the absence of decisive reactions it remains doubtful which of these formulae represents the base obtained by the action of sodalime on narcotine I may state here that propylamine as prepared by WERTHEIMS process and the liquid containing trimethylamine for as yet I have not obtained this substance perfectly pure exhibit the same remarkable fishy odour It deserves moreover to be remarked that Dr ANDERSON found that propyl amine occurs associated with methylamine among the basic products of the decomposition of codeine

expect that the action of iodide of methyl upon leucoline and the subsequent decomposition of the iodide produced by means of protoxide of silver would enable us to reconvert leucoline in this manner into quinine This metamorphosis would be the more interesting as it would open a source for the arti ficial production of quinine leucoline being as is well known contained in consi derable quantity in the basic portion of coaltar naphtha It may be stated here that leucoline which is a substance remarkable for its antipathy to the crystalline form when submitted to the action of iodide of methyl solidifies at once into a splendid mass of crystals of a new iodide which in fact resembles in its outward appearance hydriodate of quinine and which is still under examination I am however by no means sanguine as to the result of this experirnent for the above play of formulae rests as yet on a very precarious foundation neither the formula of quinine tior that of leucoline being established beyond a doubt Nevertheless I intend to complete this investigation because even if no other result is obtained yet by means of this process new data for ultimately fixing the formnulae of quinine and leucoline may be found In conclusion it may not be out of place to consider how far the preceding researches affect the received views regarding the constitution of the ammonia salts Without reproducing all the argumnents brought forward by the supporters of the various theories we may remember that irrespectively of the imrpossibility of isolating ammonium itself the instability of its oxide has been adduced as one of the most important objections against the assumption of the amllmoniuimtheory as ori ginally suggested by AMPBRE and subseqtlently elaborated by BERZELIus It desetrves to be noticed that BERZELIUS expressly states that he considers the solution of arm moniagas in water as a solution of the hydrated oxide of amnmonium This idea which is but a logical conclusion fiom the generalization of the facts is discountenanced to a certain extent by the chemical and physical character of this solution Everybody knows that even at the commton temperature this liquid splits again into water and ammonia while it still exhibits the character of the latter in so marked a manner as almost to preclude the idea that it had undergone as essential a change as the transformation into oxide of amnmonium n ecessarily must be Under these circumstances some interest is attached to the discovery of a series of con pound bases corresponding in their composition to hydrated oxide of ammonium  A similar result is obtained by the action of iodide of ethyl upon conine and nicotine 393DR A W HOFMANNS RESEARCHES INTO THE fiom which they differ only by containing methyl ethyl and amyl in the place of hydrogen and exhibiting a deportment which agrees much better with the anti cipated character of such compounds as suggested by analogy Here we find a very marked difference between the properties of the compound ammonia and those of the ammoniumoxide belonging to it in the latter we observe no longer any feature which could possibly betray the presence of the former all their habits volatility odour taste c are totally changed there is a difference between the two groups which is not inferior to that between ammonia and potassa The solutions of the new oxides may be boiled for hours without the slightest quantity of the correspond ing ammonia being disengaged several of these oxides containing more or less water of constitution or crystallization may actually be obtained in the dry state It is evi dent that the arguments mentioned above as adduced in refutation of the ammo niumtheory cannot well be raised against the compound ammoniurns But who could deny the parallelism of these substances with the Berzelian typewith the oxide of ammonium  Again many have found it difficult to conceive that in the combination of anim mnonia with hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid the hydrogen of the latter should leave tle chlorine and bromine for which it is known to possess so powerful an affinity in order to unite with ammonia converting it into ammonium And they were the less inclined to admit of such a disposition of the elements as every days experience showed that the alleged chloride or bromide of ammonium was incapable of ex changing oxygen for chlorine or bromine without losing the additional equivalent of hydrogen again in the form of water In other terms the decomposition of salam moniac by lime into chloride of calcium ammoniagas and water induced them to consider this salt as a compound of ammonia and hydrochloric acid for in the con ception of the ammoniurntheory we should have to assume in this decomposi tion two consecutive changes the transformation of the chloride into oxide and the subsequent splitting of the latter into ammoniacal gas and water I readily admit that the latter view is less simple but I amr inclined to think that this slight inconvenience is altogiether overruled by the general advantages of the ammoniurn theory especially for the purposes of instruction by the facility with which it ac counts for all phenomena of transposition and substitution and by the simple expla nation it gives of the isomorphism of the potassium and ammoniumcompounds which will always be the firmest foundation of this theory On the other hand we have to inquire which of the two views comes nearest to truth and here a comparative consideration of the deportment exhibited by the compound ammoniums nmay be of some interest In many respects their properties are more clearly pronounced and their behaviour is explicit and unequivocal in those very points in which the typical ammonium leaves room for speculation In the combination of triethylamine with bromide or iodide of ethyl it is no longer a matter of doubt whether the ethyl leaves the iodine in order to unite more intimately with the triethylamine for we see that 394MOLECULAR CONSTITUTION OF THE ORGANIC BASES the new iodide thus produced is capable of exchanging its iodine for oxygen without the newlyformed oxide suffering immediate decomposition as is the case with oxide of ammonium On the contrary we find this new oxide endowed with remark able stability although under the influence of heat it is liable to the same change which befalls the oxide of ammonium its corresponding ammonia being reproduced Here then in the decomposition of iodide of triethylammonium by metallic oxides we are obliged by irresistible evidence to acknowledge those very two stages the assumption of which in the analogous change of iodide of ammonium appeared to us deficient in simplicity and probability The conception of ammonium does not in any way imply the notion that the differ ent hydrogenatoms united with nitrogen in the molecule of the compound metal retain their position in the molecular system with equal persistency We are forced by unequivocal facts to admit that the fourth atom of hydrogen is in a peculiar state of mobility and it is on the facility with which this fourth atom is dislodged from its position that one of the foundations of the ammoniatheory rests In the compound ammoniums the mobility of the fourth atom of hydrogen or the hydrocarbon re placing it still prevails although less so than in the type itself The decomposition of the ammoniumbases under the influence of heat is particularly instructive in this respect oxide of tetrethylammonium loses the fourth equivalent of ethyl in the form of olefiant gas and water and this deportment might be graphically indicated by writing the formula of this compound in accordance with the ammoniatheory namely thus C4 H5 C H5 NN C4 H5 0 C4 H5J The iodide accordingly would be represented by the formula C4 H5 C4 H5N C4 H I C4 HJ an expression which is moreover in perfect lharmony with the mode in which this compound is produced namely by the direct union of iodide of ethylwith triethyl amine But now we combine the triethylamine with iodide of amyl whereby the iodide C4 H5 N C10 Hl I C4 HJ is formed which as we have seen in the preceding pages may be converted without difficulty into the corresponding oxide this oxide however cannot possibly be con sidered as C4 H15 C4 H5 N C1o Hll 0 C4 H5J 95DR A  W HOFMANNS RESEARCHES INTO THE for the disengagement of olefiant gas under the influence of heat proves to us that it is an ethylatom which in ttis compound occupies the supplemental position if I may so call it as represented in the formula C4 H C4 H5 NC4 H 50 Co HaJ and that the iodide which is not likely to differ in its constitution from the oxide has likewise to be represented by the formula C4 H5 CH5 N C4 H5  Clo HnJ C10 LI The preceding considerations clearly show that whatever the actual disposition of the molecules in ammonium or its congeners may be the atoms rearrange themselves whenever the fourth equivalent of hydrogen or of its substitute joins the compound This rearrangement so evident in the ammoniumbases containing various hydro carbons may be traced moreover in the lower ethylbases in a very obvious manner For as long as there is any basic hydrogen present in the ammoniaskeleton this hydrogen assumes what I have previously called the supplemental position whenever the ammnonia passes into the state of ammonium by the accession of a radical Bromide of ethylammonium formed by the combination of ammonia with bromide of ethyl when decomposed by a metallic oxide yields ethylammonia water and a metallic bromide the oxide of ethylammonium formed in the first instance being decomposed like oxide of ammonium itself It is this very transposition which we are in the habit of representing by the equation H3 NC4 115 BrC4 H5 H2 N H Br In the preceding pages I have stated some of the reasons which induced me to adopt the idea of an ammonium for the new class of compounds which I have had the honour to place before the Royal Society in the present memoir I need scarcely mention that such a step involves as a matter of necessity the assumption of a similar view for all the lower bases which form part of this investigation It would be incon sistent to speak any longer of hydrochlorate of ethylatnmine of hydrobromate of diethylamine c these salts have henceforward to be called chloride of ethylammo nium bromide of diethylammonium c these compounds being nothing but interme diate substitutionterms between the type and the last derivative On considering the various chlorides from this point of view we arrive at the following series Chloride of Ammonium    H4 N C1 Chloride of Ethylammonium N Cl 396MOLECULAR CONSTITUTION OF THE ORGANIC BASES Chloride of Diethylammonium   HN Cl C4 H52J Chloride of Triethylammonium   H N Cl C4 Ha Chloride of Tetrethylammonium  C4 H54 N CI The idea of an ammonium once adopted we have to follow it out in as general a form as possible and hence I perfectly agree with those chemists who consider the salts of REISETS second base as compounds of the Platammonium Platosammonium H3N X Pt J the ammoniosulphate of silver as sulphate of argentammonium H3N SO4 and the ammoniochloride of copper as chloride of cuprammonium Cu C1 But I would go farther and advocate an analogous constitution for a great number of mercurycompounds which are now usually considered in a different way Sitlce the careful experiments of Sir ROBERT KANE have pointed out the true composition of the white precipitate chemists are in the habit of viewing this substance as a com pound of chloride and amide of mercury Hg H2 N Hg Cl it may be viewed with equal justice as chloride of dimercurammonium 2 IN C1 Hg2J and would correspond in this form to the chloride of diethylammonium dimercur ammonium intimately combined with protoxide of mercury may be assumed in all the various salts of M MILLONS mercurybase It would be interesting experiment ally to follow out in detail the analogy of the mercurycompounds with the series of ethyl bases Even now the materials at our disposal appear to point to the exist ence of the other terms In MITSCHERLICHS garnetoctohedrons we might perceive a chloride of mercurammonium H3 N Cl Hg C1 while PLANTAMOURS nitride of mercury presents itself as trimercuramine Hg3N and the red compound obtained by MITSCHERLTCH on heating the white precipitate might be viewed as a combination of chloride of mercury with chloride of tetramercuram monium Hg4 N Cl Hg C1 MDCCCLI 3 F 397DR A W HOFMANN ON THE ORGANIC BASES The ammonium type may be traced even in a class of compounds which has hitherto been regarded in a perfectly different point of view I refer to the substances pro duced by the combination of metallic salts with more than one equivalent of am Inonia Protochloride of platinum unites with two equivalents of ammonia forming the chloride of REISETS first base in the same manner sulphate of copper nitrate of silver absorb both two equivalents of ammonia the latter salt even three equivalents These substances although containing 2 equlivs of nitrogen may still be viewed as ammnoniumcompounds if we apply to them an interesting observation made by Pro fessor GRAHAM namely that ammonia wtlenever it joins a compound containing hydrogen may be regarded as ammonium replacing 1 equiv of hydrogen

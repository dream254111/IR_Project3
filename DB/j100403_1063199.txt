facto legislation often is whether the real purpose of the law is to inflict a penalty for a past offense or to establish a bona fide regulation of a matter of public concern in the interest of the general welfare Ex parte Garland 4 Wall 333 Hawker v New York 170 U S 189 Blackburn v State 50 Ohio 428 36 N E 18 Washington v State 75 Ala 582 A statute diminishing the pay of public officers during their incumbency is not ex post facto Commonwealth v Bailey 81 Ky 395 Nor is a statute rendering a man ineligible to hold public office by reason of his having held the office within a certain period preceding the election though applying to men who have held the office before its passage State v Teasley 194 Ala 574 69 South 723 In the instant case it seems that the punishment is not for the past act of obtaining intoxicating liquor but for the pres ent offense of keeping it See Delaney v Plunkett supra The court refused to indicate what would be its holding should a similar case come before it in which the liquor had been acquired prior to the pas sage of the act On this point see Bartemeyer v Iowa supra Beer Co v Massachusetts supra and Gherna v State supra EEDSCONSTRUCTIONINNTNION OF PARTIEsThe plaintiff pos sessed of an undivided onethird interest in certain lots executed a deed the granting clause of which purported to convey the entire par cel of land but had words appended limiting the estate to such in terest as had been awarded him The instrument was partly printed and partly written and bore evidence of unskilled draftsmanship Sub sequent to the conveyance to the respondent by the plaintiffs grantee the plaintiff acquired title to the remaining twothirds interest On the question whether the plaintiff was entitled to a partition sale it was held the plaintiff is so entitled Porter v Henderson Ala 82 South 668 The object of construing a deed is to ascertain and carry into effect the intention of the parties Pack v Whitaker 110 Va 122 65 S E 496 Halsey v Fulton 119 Va 571 89 S E 912 Where this intention is not manifest from a consideration of the deed as a whole the instrument will be construed in the light of the circumstances leading to and sur rounding its execution Peters v McLaren 134 C C A 198 218 Fed 410 Seery v Waterbury 82 Conn 567 74 Atl 908 25 L R A N S 681 18 Ann Cas 73 Schroeder v Woodward 116 Va 506 82 S E 192 But extraneous facts will not be permitted to place a con struction on the deed inconsistent with the plain legal meaning of the words used Fitzgerald v Modoc County 164 Cal 493 129 Pac 794 44 L R A N S 1229 See White v Bailey 65 W Va 573 64 S E 1019 23 L R A N S 232 Technical rules of construction will not be applied if the result would be to defeat the intention of the parties as clearly shown in the deed Johnson v McCoy 112 Va 580 72 S E 123 Springs v Hopkins 171 N C 486 88 S E 774 However if the deed expresses two con flicting intentions it must be construed according to the rules of con 62RECENT DECISIONS struction although they may be arbitrary See Dickson v Van Hoose 157 Ala 459 47 South 718 19 L R A N S 719 Thus when there are repugnant clauses in a deed the first will control and the latter be rejected Wilkins v Norman 139 N C 40 51 S E 797 111 Am St Rep 767 And where words of a welldefined legal significance are used in one part of a deed and in another place in the same instru ment the grantor contradicts them in untechnical terms the legal in tent will prevail over the apparent actual intent Wolverton v Hoff man 104 Va 605 52 S E 176 It is to be observed that the intention of the parties is in legal contemplation that which the words and phrases used express not what either of the parties understood the meaning of the language to be Union Water Power Co v Lewiston 101 Me 564 65 Atl 67 Thomas v Hatch 3 Sumn 170 23 Fed Cas 946 If the deed bears on its face evidence of having been drafted by one unlearned in legal phraseology greater latitude is to be allowed in the interpretation of technical words Johnson v McCoy supra But the instrument cannot be reconstructed the intention is to be derived from a fair consideration of the language employed effect being given to each clause so far as it can be reconciled with the general intent gathered from the instrument as a whole Carpenter v Camp Mfg Co 112 Va 300 71 S E 559 Culpeper National Bank v Wrenn 115 Va 55 78 S E 620 See Coble v Barringer 171 N C 445 88 S E 518 L R A 1916E 901 The written and printed parts of a deed are equally binding Wall work v Derby 40 Ill 527 But if they are inconsistent the former will control the latter Miller v Mowers 227 Ill 392 81 N E 420 John Deere Plow Co v City Hardware Co 175 Ala 512 51 South 821 See DePaige v Douglas 234 Mo 78 136 S W 345 Where a deed admits of two constructions it will be construed most strongly against the grantor Griffin v Fairmont Coal Co 59 WVa 480 53 S E 24 2 L R A N S 1115 Carpenter v Camp Mfg Co supra Bradley v Va R etc Co 118 Va 233 87 S E 721 But this rule is to be applied only when all other rules of construction have failed Ber nero v McFarland Real Estate Co 134 Mo App 290 114 S W 531 If there be a conflict between the granting and habendum clauses the rule in many States is that the habendum must yield See Dick son v Wildman 105 C C A 618 183 Fed 398 and Hughes v Ham mond 136 Ky 694 125 S W 144 26 L R A N S 808 But accord ing to the weight of modern authority this rule is not enforced if it would defeat the intention of the parties as shown by a consideration of the entire instrument Culpeper National Bank v Wrenn supra Wil liams v Williams 175 N C 160 95 S E 157 Husted v Rollins 156 Iowa 546 137 N W 462 42 L R A N S 378 Instead the inten tion may be expressed anywhere in the instrument in any words of plain meaning and the court will enforce it when it is ascertained without regard to technical rules of construction Utter v Sidman 170 Mo 284 70 S W 702 Berry v Spivey 44 Tex Civ App 18 97 S W 511 For

j100168,Harvard Law Review,1325746,Is the Incidence of the Burden of Proof a Matter of Substantive or Procedural Law,i256993,IS THE INCIDENCE OF THE BURDEN OF PROOF A MATTER OF SUB STANTIVE OR PROCEDURAL LAW  The Supreme Court of the United States has recently decided that the federal rule establishing contribu tory negligence as an affirmative defence must apply in suits arising under the Federal Employers Liability Act even though the lex fori requires the plaintiff to show his own freedom from fault By virtue of the Conformity Act federal courts would follow the local practice in matters of procedure though the action is brought under a federal statute But it is a misnomer maintains the court to say that the question as to the burden of proof is a mere matter of state procedure For in Vermont and in a few other states proof of plaintiffs freedom from fault is a part of the very substance of his case Central Vermont Ry Co v White 238 U S 507 The same question has arisen in another 1 I U S COMP STAT 1913  I537 p 65796 HARVARD LAW REVIEW connection in New York where it was decided that since the incidence of the burden of proof 2 is only a matter of procedure and statutes chang ing remedial law may act retrospectively3 a legislative enactment shifting it shall apply in the trial of a cause of action that arose before the statute was passed Sackheim v Piqueron i09 N E I094 Though the latter decision seems to represent the weight of authority5 the important con flict of opinion illustrates the obscurity of the line between substantive and adjective law To define substantive rights in terms of all their component elements is impracticable for such rights are acquired only when a number of conditions are satisfied In an action for negligent injury for example the plaintiff ordinarily has a primd facie right to recover when he has pleaded and proved that the defendant acted carelessly toward him thereby causing injury but the defendant may show that despite these circumstances the alleged right never accrued because of the presence of other conditions such as the plaintiffs assumption of risk or his own contributory negligence6 Likewise in a suit for breach of contract proof of mutual promises and a breach by the defendant will make out a primd facie case yet if the defendant can show the further elements of fraud or coverture there is no right of recovery7 From this it is ap parent that a change in the legal relationship between two parties whereby one obtains a right against the other can be defined completely only in terms of the interplay of many circumstances What elements the plaintiff must allege and prove in an action to assert his right and what are left to the defendant as affirmative defences is solely a matter of fairness between the parties and of expediency in adjudicating rights8 The number and importance of the factors that determine the rights of the parties remains the same whether one or the other must prove the presence or absence of those factors9 Clearly if a restrospective statute enacted that contributory negligence should not bar recovery the sub stantive rights would be affected for a liability would thereby be im posed which did not before exist But shifting the burden of proof how ever important it may be to the parties in a particular case10 simply 2 Throughout this discussion the phrase burden of proof  is used in the sense of establishing a preponderance of evidence For a treatment of the different meanings see THAYER PRELIMINARY TREATISE ON EVIDENCE ch 9 3 Peace v Wilson

involved in presenting the whole case The substance of the controversy is unchanged No doubt one source of confusion in this subject is the tendency to mistake for matters of substantive right certain methods of procedure which are guaranteed by the Constitution against the operation of retrospective legislation Thus for instance retrospective legislation abolishing trial by jury 11 in crim inal cases is held void under the ex post facto clause because the change it was said took from the accused a right that was regarded at the time of the adoption of the Constitution as vital for the protection of life and liberty and which he enjoyed at the time of the commission of the crime charged against him 12 Likewise a similar statute dimin ishing the amount of proof necessary to convict can have no retroactive effect3 It might erroneously be inferred from this that other rules of procedure  including those regarding the incidence of the burden of proof  are of the substance of a partys case These decisions how ever do not rest on any distinction between substantive and procedural law but depend merely on whether a change in procedure has under mined constitutional rights cute or defend in the manner prescribed at the time the suit is entered without reference to when the cause of action accrued or the character of previously existing forms of procedure though it may turn out that present modes are less advantageous to one of the parties Southern Indiana Ry Co v Peyton 157 Ind 690 693 6i N E 722 723 11 It is clear that the intrinsic elements of a legal controversy remain the same whether tried before a jury or before a judge just as they remain unchanged whether the plaintiff or the defendant has the burden of proving a particular element 12 State ex rel Sherburne v Baker 50 La Ann 1247 24 So 240 The difficulty is not so much as to the soundness of the general rule that an ac cused has no vested right in particular modes of procedure as in determining whether particular statutes by their operation take from an accused any right that was re garded at the time of the adoption of the Constitution as vital for the protection of life and liberty and which he enjoyed at the time of the commission of the crime charged against him Thompson v Utah 170 U S 343 352 COOLEY TREATISE ON CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS 6 ed 326 13 See Duncan v Missouri 152 U S

CREDITOR OR THE LANDLORD OR THE BAILOR AND OUGHT TO PAY FOR IT UNLESS HE BE ALLOWED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIS OWN WRONG IN NOT MAKING PAYMENT AT THE DAY 5 DOES NOT INTEREST BEAR THE SAME RELATION TO THE PRINCIPAL LOANED AS THE HIRE FOR A HORSE BEARS TO THE HORSE WHO WOULD CONTEND THAT A LIVERYMAN IS NOT ENTITLED TO INTEREST UPON SUCH HIRE IF PAY MENT IS NOT MADE WHEN DUE IS IT OPPRESSIVE OR IS IT SIMPLY JUST TO AWARD IT INTEREST HAS BEEN AWARDED UPON DEFAULTED INSTALL MENTS OF THE HIRE OF SLAVES6 AND THE DECISION SEEMS IRREPROACHA BLE HOW DISTINGUISH THIS FROM THE HIRE OF MONEY NOR IS IT STRICTLY ACCURATE TO SAY THAT SIMPLE INTEREST BY WAY OF DAMAGES FOR NONPAYMENT OF INTEREST IS COMPOUND INTEREST IT IS INTEREST UPON A DEBT PAST DUE ONLY IF THE INTEREST DUE AS DAMAGES WERE ITSELF MADE TO BEAR INTEREST COULD IT BE SAID THAT COMPOUND INTEREST WAS AWARDED IT IS SAFE TO SAY THAT THIS WOULD NEVER BE DONE THE RULE ESTABLISHED BY THE BETTER DECISIONS AND THE SOUNDER REASONING MAY BE THUS SUMMED UP INTEREST ON THE PRINCIPAL BEARS SIMPLE INTEREST FROM THE TIME IT FALLS DUE UNTIL IT IS PAID BUT IN NO CASE CAN ANY PART OF THE INTEREST UPON INTEREST BE MADE TO BEAR INTEREST7 THE DIFFERENT VIEW MAINTAINED IN VIRGINIA NOT ONLY AVOIDS HARSH NESS TO THE DEBTOR BUT GOES THE LENGTH OF OPPRESSING THE CREDITOR J E R THE EXISTENCE OF A LEGAL REMEDY NO LONGER A BAR TO IN JUNCTION OF ILLEGAL TAXESPRIOR TO THE YEAR 1916 THE LAW OF VIRGINIA AS FIXED BY A LONG LINE OF DECISIONS WAS TO THE EFFECT THAT A COURT OF EQUITY HAD CONCURRENT JURISDICTION WITH A COURT OF LAW OVER THE QUESTION OF ILLEGAL TAX ASSESSMENTS1 THE FACT THAT AN ADEQUATE REMEDY AT LAW WAS AVAILABLE TO THE TAXPAYER WAS HELD NO BAR TO INJUNCTIVE RELIEF2 NATURALLY IT BECAME A FREQUENT OCCUR RENCE FOR THE VALIDITY OF AN ASSESSMENT TO BE TRIED IN THE EQUITY COURTS IN PROCEEDINGS FOR AN INJUNCTION AND THIS WAS TRUE EVEN WHERE THE PLAINTIFF HAD HE PAID THE TAX AND GONE INTO A COURT OF LAW MIGHT HAVE HAD COMPLETE JUSTICE DONE HIM THERE3 8 BLEDSOE V NIXON 69 N C 89 12 AM REP 642 1873  HOYLE V JONES 35 GA 40 89 AM DEC 273 1866 A ANKETEL V CONVERSE 17 OHIO ST 11 91 AM DEC 115 1866 GODDIN  CRUMP 8 LEIGH 120 1837 CITY OF

1919  2385 ET SEQ 389VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW NOW THE ORIGINAL RULE IN MOST OF THE STATES HAD BEEN THAT SAVE WHERE SPECIAL AND PECULIAR EQUITIES EXISTED THE COLLECTION OF ILLE GAL TAXES COULD NEVER BE ENJOINED4 THE PROMPT AND UNEMBAR RASSED COLLECTION OF THE PUBLIC REVENUE WAS CONSIDERED VITAL TO THE WELFARE OF THE STATE5 THOUGH THIS RULE HAS BEEN VERY GENERALLY MODIFIED THE FEDERAL COURT RULE AND THE RULE IN MOST STATES REQUIRES THE PURSUANCE OF A LEGAL REMEDY WHERE SUCH REMEDY EXISTS AND IS ADEQUATE6 IN 1916 THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING ACT BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF VIRGINIA THAT NO SUIT FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESTRAINING THE ASSESSMENT OR COLLECTION OF ANY TAX STATE OR LOCAL SHALL BE MAINTAINED IN ANY COURT IN THIS COMMONWEALTH EXCEPT WHEN THE PARTY HAS NO ADEQUATE REM EDY AT LAW PROVIDED THIS ACT SHALL NOT AFFECT ANY PENDING SUIT 7 THUS WAS VIRGINIA BROUGHT INTO LINE WITH THE MORE GENERAL AND IT IS BELIEVED THE MORE DESIRABLE RULE THE PURPOSE OF THIS NOTE IS SIMPLY TO CALL ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT THIS ACT WAS NOT INCORPO RATED BY THE REVISORS INTO THE CODE OF 1919 NOR HAS IT FOUND A PLACE IN ANY SUBSEQUENT LEGISLATION ITS OMISSION BY THE REVISORS EFFECTS ITS REPEAL8 IT WOULD SEEM THEN THAT THE LAW STANDS ONCE MORE AS IT STOOD BEFORE THE PASSAGE OF THIS ACT IN 1916 AND THAT TODAY IN VIRGINIA AN ILLEGAL ASSESSMENT MAY BE ENJOINED REGARDLESS OF THE QUESTION OF EXISTING LEGAL REMEDIES T L P EQUITYPLEADINGEXCEPTION OR DEMURRER TO ANSWER THE REPORTS AND LAW BOOKS IN GENERAL ARE FULL OF STATEMENTS TO THE EFFECT THAT A DEMURRER TO AN ANSWER IN CHANCERY IS A PLEADING UN KNOWN TO THE CHANCERY PRACTICE BUT THERE HAVE BEEN FEW CASES INDEED IN WHICH THE APPELLATE COURTS HAVE CONSIDERED A DEMURRER TO AN ANSWER FATAL THE USUAL COURSE IS TO CONDEMN THAT PARTICULAR FORM OF PROCEDURE TREAT THE DEMURRER AS SETTING THE CASE FOR HEAR ING ON BILL AND ANSWER AND PROCEED ACCORDINGLY IN THE FEDERAL COURTS THE RULE LAID DOWN IN CROUCH V

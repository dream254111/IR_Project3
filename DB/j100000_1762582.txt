shown in the accompanying illustration Fig 3 has been in constant use in this city for several months and is of the type selected by the Julien Company as the standard for their service It has a sixteenfoot body mounted on a rigid truck with a sixfoot wheel base which carries two ten horsepower electric motors the truck being entirely independent of the car body and may be re moved if necessary The weight of the var with motors gearing and battery in position is between si and seven tons The mo tors are geared direct one to each axle and are accessible from THE JULIEN ELECTRIC TRACTION SEtSTEM THE Julien electric cars harre now been in regular passenger service for a little oser two years in Brussels and a report has just been prepared of the cost of motive power during that time including the renewal of batteries the wear and tear on motors and machinery the generating and storing of the energy and re pairs and replacements generally in fact every element that can be understood by an engineer to be motisre power It is found that the cost of motie power has been a trifle less than three cents per kilometer or about fixre cents per carmile in this the cost of FIG I AND 2STORAGE BATTERY CHARGING RACK JULIEN ELECTRIC CAR STATION maintaining the batteries has amounted to a cent and sistenths per carmile It maybe of interest to know that the estimate of the cost of nzotive power as based on the experiences of the Julien Electric Traction Company on the Fourth and Madison avenues and pre pared prior to the report at Brussels and without any knowledge of the cost there is within a fraction of being the same The Julien Company find theicost of motive power on Madison Avenue to be five and threetenths cents per carmile In the cost of mo tive power as estimated in New York however was included in terest on investment amounting to one and eighttenths cents or the car floor by trapdoors The battery consists of I08 cells which are placed in six tras of nine each on each side of the car under the seats these traws are placed in the car by dropping the side panels The chief difficulty encountered in the operation of the Fourth Avenue line was the handling of the batteries but recent improve ments have entirely overcome this difficulty First a flexible con nector was devised by which it is possible to couple up cells with great rapidity Next a battery rack xnas constructed large enough to store batteries for ten or twelve cars This rack is shown in Figs I and 2 This rack makes it possible to remove the batteries fromI 58 SCIENCE VOL XIV No

svithdrawn from and replaced in the car While this change is baing made a competent person inspects the regulators of the car The motor s geal ings and connections are only inspected once a day and that at the end of the days work GOLD EXTRACTION BY A NENV PROCESS IN many places where goldbearing quartz is found containing a sufficient percentage of the metal to pay for working it there is either an entire absence of the water necessary to work the process at present emplowed for its extraction or it can only be obtained at great expense and trouble in many cases only part of the year which he could quickly determine whether any specimens of quartz contained gold by simply crushing it with a hammer and running it through the machine The mechanism of this apparatus con sists of an inclined ladder with fine wire cloth upon one side and silk upon the other A blast of air is passed up and down through the two meshes blowing off the light particles of dirt and quarts and allowing the free gold to be retained simply by gravity An other machine is adapted for concentrating various metals from rock such as sulphates of copper lead zinc and antimony making the future separation of the valuable metals from the metalli mass by roasting or chemical processes an easy matter During the exhibit an interesting experiment was made to show the value of the machines and the thoroughness with which they performed their work The machine used in the experiment weighed about five hundredtveight and was so compact that it could be readily FIG 3STANDARD ELECTRIC CAR JULIEN STORAGE BATTERY SYSTEM Hitherto the processes used for extracting the gold from the allu vial deposit or from crushed quartz have required large quantities of water to flush the fine pulverized material containing the gold and even with the best methods large quantities of gold were car ried off with the earth and quartz anl lost before it reached the mercury The need of some ready method for the dry extraction of the gold has long been felt but until recently the various machines proposed have not been found equal to the old processes The various difficulties in the way of dry extraction have apparently been overcome in a new machine which was exhibited in London a few weeks ago By this process as described in Irout the use of mercury is dispensed with and the gold is extracted readily from alluvial deposits or quartz The process is also applicable to the extraction of any combination of metals from refractory ore One of the machines exhibited weighed but six pounds and was in tended to form part of the outfit of the prospector by the use of transported from one place to another A quantity of gold in minute particles weighing six drams and two small nuggets were put into a large pan with two hundredweight of gravel and grit and the whole mass put into the machine which was operated with about a quarterhorse power or as an equivalent twoman power The principle of the machine is similar to the small separator usedl for prospecting purposes with the blast of air driving off the fine particles of extraneous material while  oscillating riddles contain ing shot shake off the heavier grit and stones allowing free goldl to sink by gravity into the shot where it is retained and in turn falls to the bottom of the shot In about a minute after the mix ture was placed in the machine the whole treatment was com pleted and of the amount of gold originally put into the machine 963 per cent was recovered With more time devoted to the separation a considerably smaller percentage of loss would doubt less have ensued

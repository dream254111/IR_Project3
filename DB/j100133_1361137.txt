j100133,The Condor,1361137,The Woodhouse Jay in Western Colorado,i259129,THE WOODHOUSE JAY IN WESTERN COLORADO By ROBERT B ROCKWELL T HERE are few if any American birds which have received less recognition from Ornithological writers than the Woodhouse jay hence a few observa tions regarding this bird may be of interest The writers acquaintance with the Woodhouse jay was mostly acquired in the eastern part of Mesa County Colorado which is located on the western edge of the State adjoining Utah and about the middle of the State north and south The eastern part of the County is mountainous ranging in altitude from 5000 to 10000 feet and for the most part is well watered and timbered Thruout this sec tion in localities ranging from 6000 to 9000 feet this jay is a common resident thruout the year During the winter months they are found in large numbers in the brushclad gulches and ravines in the lower part of their range and usually not far from culti vated ground where they feed largely upon grain and seed in the barnyards feedlots and fields During this period they become very tame if not molested and will even occasionally slip into an open kitchen door in quest of some tempting morsel Like the rest of the jays they are very inquisitive birds and a good deal of their time is spent investigating When feeding they are very quiet and sel dom make any noise unless surprised or frightened They are at all times very cautious birds and altho they are fully as plentiful around the meat bait in coyote traps as the magpie I have never known of a jay being trapped while large numbers of the magpies are caught in this manner As soon as the first feathery green appears on the scruboak covered hillsides Woodhousie forgets his domestic habits of the winter and thruout the summer is seldom seen in the vicinity of the ranch houses except when on some short forag ing expedition82 THE CONDOR VOL IX Their favorite haunt is a gulch on an open hillside which is heavily covered with scruboak serviceberry and pinyon and here they are found in numbers flitting thru the underbrush and keeping out of sight as much as possible but continually uttering the coarse grating cry characteristic of so many of this family When undisturbed they will occasionally mount a high fence post or the top most branches of a small pinyon tree in plain sight of the surrounding ground but when disturbed they quickly disappear and trust largely to the cover of the under brush for protection As the breeding season approaches they are much quieter and very retiring in their habits and when incubation begins only a careful search will satisfy the ob it wo 4A c r Gr LIEZIY nc rw 77 E f rP ta4E 41 l e  26 WNW NEST AND EGGS OF THE WOODHOUSE JAY FROM PHOTO TAKEN IN MESA COUNTY COLORADO JUNE 16 19o3 server that there is a Woodhouse jay anywhere in the country except for an oc casional male bird who flies aimlessly about in a manner thoroly exasperating to the observer who wonders where the nest is In the location and concealment of the nests they are evidently adepts as in five years observatious I found but two nests one of which was unoccupied and even after the leaves have dropped in the fall they are rarely seen a fact which can only be accounted for by the birds rare art of concealment for the nests are far too strongly built to weather away during the period between their occupancy and the falling leaves and the birds are so abundant in all suitable localities that nests must be more or less commonMay 1907 THE WOODHOUSE JAY IN WESTERN COLORADO 83 My first experience with the breeding birds occurred on June 16 1903 I was carefully beating out a rather steep hillside sloping down from a high sandstone butte at an altitude of about 6800 feet looking for nests of the Wright flycatcher The hillside was badly washed by the spring rains forming little gulches in the red adobe soil The entire area was well covered with patches of serviceberry buck brush scruboak and an occasional pinyon As my pony brushed against a peculiarly thick clump of serviceberry I heard a very slight flutter and not seeing a bird fly out I dismounted and forced my way into the clump As I did so the bird slipped quietly out on the other side and I caught a fleeting glimpse of her as she flew barely a foot off the ground into a nearby bush The nest for such it proved to be was built near the center of the clump and about four feet from the ground It was held in place by a thick network of small angular twigs and two larger vertical branches none over Y8 inch in diameter The only concealment afforded the nest was the thick mat of leaves at the extrem ity of the branches which formed a sort of canopy about the exterior of the bush not a leaf being near enough to the nest to afford concealment but right here is where I discovered the secret of their concealment The outer structure of course so nearly resembles the network of small twigs in the serviceberry bush that it was difficult to tell where the nest stopped and the twigs began The nest itself which at first appeared to be a rather fragile structure upon closer examination proved to be a remarkable piece of bird architecture It was composed of a platform of very crooked dead twigs thickly interlaced to form a basketlike structure in which the nest proper was firmly placed The latter which was entirely separate from the outer basket was a beautifully woven and interlaced cup composed of fine weed stalks on the outside giving place to fine brown fibrous rootlets toward the interior which was sparingly lined with horsehair In general appearance the exterior was not unlike the nest of the white rumped shrike while the interior or nest proper closely resembled a blackheaded grosbeaks nest The entire structure while not particularly artistic exhibited a high grade of bird architecture and was remarkably strong and durable The nest outside measured about six inches in diameter by six inches in depth and the interior structure measured outside 4 inches in diameter by 234 inches deep inside 34 inches in diameter by 24 inches deep During the entire time I was examining and photographing the nest the male remained at the very top of a nearby serviceberry bush perfectly silent and ap parently unconcerned After flushing her from the nest I did not see the female again The nest contained three beautifully blotched eggs in which incubation was well advanced They measure 112x81 112x82 and 110x80 I am inclined to think that the date of nesting given by most authorities is somewhat earlier in that altitude as the serviceberry and scruboak are not leafed out enough to furnish suitable concealment until late in May and I think about June 1 is an average date for fresh eggs in that locality The young of the year are not very much in evidence until they are well matured but during August and September by which time the young are all able to take care of themselves the birds are particularly conspicuous and noisy It has been stated upon good authority that these birds are addicted to nest robbing but I have never seen any indications of this and judging from the good feeling which apparently exists between these birds and other species I am in84 THE CONDOR VOL IX clined to think that their depredations are not as extensive as those of others of the jay family As soon as the young birds are able to travel there seems to be a sort of ver tical migration during which large numbers of the birds ascend a few thousand feet into the heavier timbered country evidently in search of insect food although I have not examined stomachs to verify this statement This vertical movement does not affect the entire number of the species for as I have stated during August and September the birds are much in evidence thruout their range With the first frosts they congregate in small scattered flocks and perform whatever migration may be credited to them which I am inclined to think amounts to very little usually before the first big storm but climatic conditions seem to have very little effect upon them food supply alone being responsible for their migratory movements When the winter coat of white has entirely covered their food on the bleak hillsides they return to their winter haunts nearer the inhabited sections where the waste from barnyard and granary affords an abundant food supply until spring comes again Denver Colorado

SABINE President in the Chair The following communication was read Suggestions for the Attainment of a Systematic Representa tion of the Physical Aspect of the Moon By Jolnl PHILLIPS MA LLD FRS Reader in Geology in the UJniversity of Oxford Received Janiuary 15 1862 I SKETCH OF THIE PROGRESS OF SELENOGRAPHY a By Eyedraught8 and Micrometry 1 Beginning with the labours of Hevelius 1647 maps of the nmoon embracing the whole and signalizing special parts have been repeated by Riccioli 1651 Cassini 1680 Lalanide 1787 T Meyer 1748 LambertSchr6ter 1791 Lohrmann 1824 Beer and Madler 1836 2 The degree in which these laborious efforts may be regarded as meeting the wants of  Selenography is about equal to that in which the maps of England of the last century satisfy the requirements of physical geography and in the same proportion as the great one inich Ordnance MIap of 1862 is superior to the old Chart of 1800 so should be the lnew drawings of the features of the moon to the older delineations 3 That such drawinigs are attainable by the patient employment of modern instruments in hands capable of good sketching is I believe not doubted by any competent observer with either achro matic or reflecting telescopes having equiatorial mounting If any one doubts let him compare the Copernicus of Madler with the Copernicus of Secchi nay I may veniture to ask that my own Gassendi be placed side by side with that of any of the charts already iamed 4 The results likely to be attained by such a series of careful drawings of special parts of the moons surface in one branch of scientific research are recognized by Mr Conybeare in his Report on Geology to the British Association in 1832 Indeed it may be boldly affirmed that a competent theory of volcanic action can hardly82 IMarch 20 be regarded as havinig been acdequately tested much less comnpleted withouit a careful study of the magnificent volcanic surface of the moon where for the most part the consolidated products of a lonig traini of igneous eruptions are exhibited as clearly as in the celebrated region of Auvergne 5 Considerations of this kinid pressinig upon L1Jord Rtosse Dr Robinsoni General Sabinie and othler persons acquainted with the growing power of telescopes and the necessity of organizing a system for the use of them on the mooni induced the British Association assembled at Belfast in 1852 to constitute a Comrnittee consisting of the Earl of Itosse the Rev Dr Robinsoni anid Professolr Phillips for the purpose of drawing up a Report on the physical character of the moons surface as compared with that of the earth 6 Acting as Secretary to this Committee Professor Phillips for warded invitations to fourteen selected observers in Great Britain and Ireland the United States and several localities in Euirope known to be in possession of adequate instrumental power or willing to provide it To each observer a certain limited tract was offered his peculiar work but everyone was requested to add whatever in formationl he might judge useful relating to other parts of the moolls surface 7 The anlswers to these invitations were for the most part favouLr able as to good intentiorns biut in several cases want of adequiate leisuLre sometimes want of hlealth sometimes other causes were mentionied and practically it was found that very few of the selected observers sent contributions which fulfilled the wishes of the Committee even as preliminary surveys The Secretary of the Com mnittee indeed conlstructed an equatorial of large size forI his owin share of work mounted it in the open air made photographic ancd evedrawings and completed a sketch of his appointcd region on the 19th of May 1853 wlhich sketch has been in the hands of the Royal Society Ile thus establislhed to the satisfaction of several friends the facility of carryinig out the desires of the Cornmittee and would have takeni up fresh districts on every suitable occasion but for the chanoe of bis residence from York to Oxford The instrumental mounting being specially fitted for York and the cir cumstances of his residence there he was unable to continue his work at Oxford  and several years as far as this problem is concerned have1862 33 been lost to him for want of an instrument of adequate power and suit able construction conveniently placed and always at coimmand 8 Mr Nasmyth several years since employed his fine reflector with a peculiar apparatus for drawing in these representations of the moon which have justly earned for him a reputation in philosophic art of which even the inventor of the steamhammer may be justly proud He has lately preferred to use for his eyedraughts a fine acllromatic by Cooke of Yorkthe same instrument which has been turned with such unexpected results to a scrutiny of the solar spots Professor Smyth of Ediinburgh and Professor Challis of Cambridge made examinations and preliminary sketches of the Mare Crisium Plato and other interesting objects the former artist employing oil colours in his scenepainting b By Photography 9 Meantime a new and beautiful art was making itself auxiliary to the delineation of the moonfirst by the silver plate of Daguerre afterwards by the increasingly sensitive collodion surface The great achromatic of Cambridge US under the hands of Bond and Whiffle gave results of much promise at first the lightpictures were of the full moon 2 inches diameter oln daguerreotype plates  afterwards we saw larger representations of the crescent mooni with stronger lights and shadows on the ridges and in the hollows several inches across 185153 10 While observing with the great reflector at Birr every one was struck with the probability that almost instantaneous pictures could be obtained of the moon stars and planiets by the amazing quantity of light brought to the focus of that magniificent instrument Some trials had indeed been made in 1852 by the distinguished constructor and MAr Woods but I am not aware of the results of later experimenits with the great reflector In 1853 1 gave much attention to the use of collodion and employed an apparatus attached to my achromatic of 11 feet focus and 6 inches diameter by which at first pictures of 12 inch diamneter and finally others from 2 to 3 inches were ob taimed in timnes gradually reduced from 5 to 301 and less I still possess many of these pictures the best however was destroyed in attempting to print from it  Kosmos iii 2 362 VOL XTI D34 Miarch 20 11 Somewhat earlier than these trials of mine were the first efforts of Mr De la Rue of which I was not aware These efforts have from year to year been rewarded with still increasing suiccess till we have had from his skilful hanids maps of the full moon of posi tive value and stereographic pictures of admirable beauty These researches are still in progress with every prospect of reaching a point from which eyedraughts may be started on a fresh basis for a systema tic scrutiny of all parts of the mooin and the construction of maps on the scale of Akth of an inich to a mile on the middle part of the moors face or as the inoon would appear under a power of 1000 12 Experliments rewarded by considerable success were completed by the Liverpool Photographic Society in 1854  and several of their valuable drawings of the moon magnified to a large scale were exhi bited at the Meeting of the British Association in Liverpool along with onie of mine similarly handled II PROPOSAL OF A METHIOD FOR FURTHER PROGRESS 13 By the labouirs for the most part uncomabined of the last tent years we have not achieved much beyonid laying the fourndation for further progress We have acquired by means of photography a general view of the whole imoon as to its proportions of light anld shade theX degrees of light of different parts of its surface the direction of the lightstreaks and other phenomena better than eyedraughts aiid micrometry could furnlish By eyedraughts and micrometry alone many of the c rmountains  and  seas of the moon have beenr sketched in beautiful landscapes by Nasrnyth and Smyth and two  ring mountains  haye been sur veyed and drawni in detail by Secehi Copernicus and Phillips Gassendi The niext ten years may douibtless be justly expected to give an equal rate of progress  photographic foundation will be made more effective for the whole moon andc for different phases of the moon and we inay add by individual and sporadic efforts a few more ring mountains to our meagre cataloguie of objects examined It appears to me however that more than this can be attainied and ought to be attempted on a plan of continuous work by means of one instrument devoted to a sturvey of selected parts of the moon and I proceed to explain ilny views1862 35 14 By Mr De la Rues exertions principally photographs of the moon have become an essential element in the desired delinea tiolns and an impression is sometimes felt that by some possible further improvement in that wonderful art eyedrawing may be dispensed with Tfhis I am persuaded can lnever happen but there is in my mind the firmest conviction that eyedrawing founded on a basis of form obtained by photography will produce results as to details of the moons pectuliarities which lightpictures alone can never reach For whether the large photographs on the scale of 100 inches to the moonis diameter which we desire to obtain are to be had by enlarging the primary pictures of I or 2 inches or by direct photographs on a larger scale it seems imnpossible to escape from somre want of definitioni by reason of the imperfect surfaces used or by reasoni of the inexact following of the moon as she changes her rate or alters her declination I know this latter error to be very likelv of occurrence even with disks taken beyond the niegative eyepiece with excellent clockwork movement and am on this account the more ready to applaud Mr De la Rue whose skil ful hanids have so well mastered that and other difficulties I cannot too strongly express my sense of the great value of the lightpictures obtained by that gentlemanas a wasis of form oln which to con struct eyedraughts showing the minds interpretation of what the eye sees on the moon but fails to discover in the finest pho tograph 15 Reflectilng on the comparatively very small degree of success which has rewarded the combination instituted nearly ten years since by the British Associationremembering that instrumental means have been improved while the scientific interest in a knowledge of the moons peculiarities has not diminishedit appears to me possible to obtain a larger measure of success by a vigorous effort in a different direction It appears to me that instead of requesting gentlemen who possess ilistruments already engaged in other re searches to turn them to selenography and make drawings in which they tnay have no special interest it will be better to carry a good instrument to an observer interested in the survey of the moon and willing for a limited time to use his exertions for the accomplish ment of a definite object In mny own case I feel sure that this would succeed and I believe that irmy case is essentially that of many D 236 March 20 intelligent observers of the moon accustomed to extrameridional ob servations 16 The first desideratum then is an Equatorial Instrument con structed with the conditions of ample optical powergreat steadiness delicate adjustment including a sufficient rarnge for latitudethe usual circular and micrometrical readingsclockmovement c so that it may be in every point of view adapted for special obser vations of the moon sun planets comets c may also be observed and be available for many years in the same optical and spacemea suring condition According to my view founded on experience with various instruments it must be an achromatic mounted on a transportable solid stand placed under the roof of a removeable ob servatory capable of holding a clock and if need be a small transit The objectglass should be of 6 inches diameter the focal length 1 6 or 1 7 diameters Such an instrument has actually been made by my direction it is finished and stands complete in the workshop of the skilful artist whose name is a guaranitee of excellence Mr T Cooke of York Thus the first requisite to give effect to my proposal is practically reached 17 The second desideratum is that the instrument shall become the property of some scientific body constituted for long enlduirance and endowed with so much influence as to be able to give effect anid gain adherence to a plan of continuous work by definite persons for such periods of time as each in successioni may command The instrument to be confided to each in successi6n and mounited in a convenient manner for his use at his home during the time appointed Each observer to furnish at least once a year an account of his observations with drawings on the plan already detailed in the instructions furnished by the Moon Committee of the British Association At the conclutsion of his appointed period of observation the instrument to be againi at the disposal of the scientific body to which it belongs either to be tralnsferred to another observer or to be again entrusted to the first observer according as may seem best for the attainmelit of the object in view 18 I entertain no doubt that after the operation of one or two years each yielling fruit there will be nao other difficulty of obtaininig1862 37 suitable observers than the difficulty of choice among several proper persons who will be glad to give their services To remove any difficulty as to the first trial I presume to offer for the first two years my own services at Oxford having already sketched out a definite plan of work which has not yet been attempted and which I believe myself able to accomplish 19 It wouild be no part of my plan to take photographs of the moon but rather to obtain from other observatories the best examples of this kind of work and devote every available hour to eyesketching on a large scale of the exact appearance of selected parts of the lunar disk The drawings thus made scrutinized and corrected in succeeding years would gradually and not very slowly grow up to complete eyedraughts of the moon unlder the conditions of sunrise mid day and sunset and would themselves be again a startingpoint for the guidance of even closer scrutiny with the greatest telescopes and the slharpest eyes 20 Finally my proposal if aliowed to make one would be that for the purpose of securing a series of satisfactory drawings of the physical features of the moon a sixinch achromatic by Cooke con structed for the purpose be purchased out of the funds of the Government Grant Committee and held by a Board composed of three Members of the Royal Society to be nominated in the first instance and the number afterwards filled up by the Council of the Royal Society in trust for the use of observers to be appointed by the Board each for a limited period and for a defined area of work the drawings and observations to be communiicated at least once a year to the Board Cost of the instrument not to exceed 320 guineas of a moveable house not to exceed 50

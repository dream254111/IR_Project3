of schoolboy life in Paris a generation ago with which the story opens WHY does the December Review of Reviews have three leading articles on educational subjects The answer must be that the public is interested for Dr Shaw knows the public feeling as well as any man Therefore it is a distinct sign of professional progress and a bow of promise to teachers this number of the Review of Reviews with  The Kindergarten Age by Heze kiah Butterworth Child Study in the Training of Teachers by E A Kirkpatrick and The Sunday Schools their Shortcomings and their Great Opportunity by President Walter L Hervey among the leading articles The last is remarkably timely suggestive and needed FRIENDS of education everywhere will hear with pleasure and encourage ment that the people of Wisconsin have voted by an enormous majority to fix the salary of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction at 1200 a year This was the amount provided in the State Constitution adopted nearly fiftyyears ago but at the recent election some inconsiderate people of icono clastic tendencies proposed an amendment fixing the salary at 3000 a year The people howeverand the majority was largest in the most intelligent districtsvery properly and wisely concluded that what was good enough for their fathers was good enough for them and the amendment was heartily defeated Congratulations to Wisconsin on its magnificent stand for economy and the unsurpassed courage with which it faces to the rear A draft of a bill to establish a State Library Commission will be presented to the Illinois State Library Association at its next meeting to be held at Springfield January 20 1897 Legislators teachers and all persons interested in library extension are urged to attend and join in the discussion A State Library Commission is a small board of unsalaried officers appointed by the governor for a term of years to promote the establishment of free public libra ries and to give advice when asked in regard to selection of books cataloguing and administration of libraries in the state The purpose of this movement is admirable but on general principles we are opposed to entrusting important public interests to unsalaried boards We hope the State Library Association may see its way to recommending a plan more like that followed by the regents of the University of the State of New York Graduate Courses I8967 an important handbook for all persons inter ested in advanced courses in American universities has recently appeared The publication is authorized by the Federation of Graduate Clubs and is edited by a corps of twentyfour graduate students under the direction of C A Duniway of the Harvard Graduate School The plan of the handbook is to present full lists of courses for graduate students to be offered in 18967 by twentyfour of the leading universities and colleges In addition to lists of courses the reader will find succinct statements of the academic careers of professors and instructors special facilities in the various departments requirements for advanced degrees and for admission to graduate standing fees exacted of graduate students fellowships and scholarships open to such students and many other valuable details The work is published by Leach Shewell  Sanborn at 30 cents postpaid DURING 1897 the Atlantic Monthly will publish in addition to technical educational studies articles treating of these important phases of educational work The Place of the Public School in typical communities where the life of the community centers about the school in these communities the public school has in many respects the ideal attitude to the life about it There will appear also articles conveying thorough studies of certain great popular educational forces or agencies such as The Chautauqua Move mentwhat it has contributed to the intellectual development of the masses  The National Educational Associationwhat measure it gives of NOTES 57THE SCHOOL REVIEW the rise in the dignity and in the efficiency of public school teachers The Extension of the Use of Librariesthe part they play in the new era of library development in the cultivation of the masses President D C Gil man of the Johns Hopkins University Baltimore and president of the board of trustees of The Peabody Educational Fund will write of the use made of this great benefaction  Teachers Pensions will be thoroughly consid ered in an early number from the points of view of the teacher and of the public THAT St Paul appreciates its loss and Newarks gain by the transfer of Superintendent Gilbert to the latter city is sufficiently indicated in the fol lowing extract from the St Paul Globe Rarely has any man received from the community in which he labored for years such a tribute as was paid to Mr C B Gilbert last evening by the people of this city The severance of his long connection with our public school system made necessary by his removal to Newark N J was the occasion of a public demonstration as unusual as it was marked by deep feel ing and earnestness It is true that no words that might be spoken and no honor that might be conferred could adequately express the great debt which the people of St Paul owe to the man whose services they have lost He is one of the foremost educators in the United States He is a thinker and an originator as well He takes the broadest and noblest views of his chosen profession and he has both unlimited personal enthusiasm and the faculty of inspiring others The rare union of these qualities accounts for his great success in educational work here and makes it impossible that we shall be able to fill his place 58

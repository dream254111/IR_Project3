j100358,The School Review,1077166,Editorial Notes,i244618,EDITORIAL NOTES Highschool teachers are disposed to hold themselves aloof from the effort which is now being made to develop a general body of principles of education The teachers of the lower grades are very much HloHScHOOL TEACHERS AND occupied with such questions as the parallelism between EDUCATIONAL racial evolution and individual development or the impor THEORY tance of the formal steps as means of organizing the ma terials of instruction The highschool teacher on the other hand absents himself from teachers meetings and with fine scorn characterizes these discussions on the part of teachers in the lower grades as useless theory All this is easily understood when it is remembered that the high school has until very recently had its work worked out for it by wellestablished tradition and by the demands of the colleges Furthermore the high school has been an exclusive institution attended by the few and consequently problems of economy of effort have never become so acute as they are in the lower schools The higher the educational institution the greater the waste which will be tolerated without question Another reason for the lack of interest in educational discussion on the part of highschool teachers is doubtless to be found in the fact that most of the scientific results which have thus far been obtained relate to the simpler problems of mental development The infant has been described frequently in books on children while little corresponding work has been done on school children With the exception of President Halls volumes on Adolescence and Youth the literature of education strikes below the highschool age and there is so much mythology in Dr Halls books that one can hardly wonder at the reluctance of highschool teachers to read or follow their teachings There are unmistakable signs however that a change is at hand The high school is breaking away from the leadings of the college The demands for better methods of organization and teaching are making NEW MOTIVES FOR THE themselves felt Traditions are weakening and the general STUDY OF scientific spirit of the age which leads men in all occupa EDUCAION tions to examine their practices critically is asserting itself even in our higher schools There are those who dare to call into question the longaccepted notions of discipline The first year of high school which drives away so many students with its barren programme of ancient history Latin and algebra is on the defensive All this means that some where and somehow the pressure is being exerted to drive the highschool teacher to a careful consideration of his task 570EDITORIAL NOTES At such a juncture as this very much depends upon the way in which the programme for future work is presented Let us arouse none of the old antipathies by suggesting the study of psychology or CERTAIN childstudy but let us insist that every highschool teacher SCIENTIFIC PCIENTIFIC be called upon to give a good reason for his or her mode of instruction Let us ask for a classification of the stu dents with reference to their differences in mental characteristics The teacher who seeks to give definite answers to such questions as these will find that there is something more in teaching than a mere knowledge of a subject The subjectmatter must be arranged so as to appeal to students The student must be considered as a part of the problem The great difficulty up to this time is that the problem of the scientific study of edu cation has not been attacked directly enough Teachers have been referred to books on this that and the other related science Let us now set up a standard of our own and say that we will study the problem by all means at hand and master it directly There is no use waiting for the psycholo gists or the sociologists or anyone else The problem of education must be taken up as a problem worthy of the best scientific talent Let a faculty take as its problem the thorough examination of the five poorest students in the school What are their traits of character and mind What is the most obvious defect in their training What steps can be tried to improve them How can a record be kept which will show the effects of the treatment This is a scientific programme which is clear enough to command respect and large enough to engage the best energies of a highly trained highschool faculty There will be another effect of the adoption of such a programme Better trained men and women will be attracted into the high schools for they will find in the scientific study of these problems a EFFECT sphere for the exercise of genuine productive intelligence TEACHERS The high school today is too often looked upon as a second rate intellectual sphere Welltrained teachers wish to get out of the high school into the higher institutions where they can carry on research The high school needs the best scientific talent that can be had Everything is being worked out scientifically today Banking agriculture advertising engineering are attractive to welltrained minds because they present problems The highschool teacher who drones over the same text year after year and sees no problem in his work ought to be rated as a second or thirdclass mind That teacher who sees the highschool prob lem and takes it up and promotes its solution will justify his profession as one of the most absorbing and as entirely worthy of any training that our highest institutions can devise C IH J 57I

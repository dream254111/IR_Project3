j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1011823,The Child and the Law,i242598,THE CHILD AND THE LAW BY A J MCKELWAY Secretary for the Southern States National Child Labor Committee While my theme is The Child and the Law the subject uppermost in my mind is the child who is unprotected by law or is exploited in violation of law My theme is rather  Law lessness in Its Effect Upon the Child and I use the word law lessness as meaning either a low standard of legislation or leg islation that is so defective as to encourage evasion of the law or its violation and particularly that spirit of lawlessness that scorns concealment and is open and shameless in its workings It is these symptoms of a widespread evil that I shall attempt to discuss their disastrous effect upon the child and perhaps the effect of the appeal of childhood for protection I once attended with some newspaper friends an oldtime negro camp meeting in North Carolina During the exercises rightly so calleda collection was taken one of the officials waiting upon the white people and another upon the colored people The latter reported the result thus  I have to thank the colored people for three dollars and sixtyseven cents The other report began I have to thank the white people for six dollars and  Dont tell it said the preacher with a gesture of protest When the white people beat the colored people dont tell it I confess to some sympathy with the sentiment of pride that prompted the colored preacher to protect his own people from a disagreeable comparison I am the more embarrassed since my paper is a report from the field of work assigned to me the Southern States and I am to make this report within the borders of a state that has reached in my judgment the highest stand ard of legislation for the protection of the children that has been attained by any American state and is most conspicuous for its effective enforcement of the law and the punishment of transgressors Yet when I think of the children whose fate is involved I am resolved to tell the truth as I see it For the 63The Annals of tie American Acadetmy knowledge of the facts must precede the proper treatment of any evil Moreover in the recital of these facts and in the earnest protest against lawlessness as regards the welfare of the chil dren I am not speaking of the South as a whole but of a part of it only I beg leave to make the broad distinction between the great majority of the Southern people whose traditions of humanity and kindheartedness are proverbial whose willing ness to sacrifice all material interests for the sake of a principle won the admiration of the worldto distinguish between the South and what is sometimes called The New South The Old South was commercial the New South has become commer cialized The people of the South who call themselves The New South have made the term unpopular among our people and they are sometimes called The Mercenaries The most familiar illustration among us of the sentiments of the Mercenaries is that of the ship loaded with an equal weight of gold and babies floundering in the seas and demand ing lightening We say that the Mercenaries would cry Over board with the babies and save the gold The South would say  Let the gold go to the bottom and the Mercenaries too but save the babies For in spite of all that may be said and that may be here said the South loves her children She has a great many of them to love The population of Massachusetts exceeds the population of Georgia by 6ooooo But the children of school age in Georgia exceed in number the children of school age in Massachusetts by Iooooo It is no longer an open question in this nation whether law is needed for the protection of the children against the exploiters of their labor It is perhaps a disgrace to our civilization that there is such need but it would be a worse disgrace if the facts were not recognized and the need met To the employer who creates the demand for child labor to the ignorant or unnatural parent who would supply that demand the law says Thou shalt not In such restriction of child labor the common judgment of both America and Europe has reached the conclusion that four teen years is the limit below which children should not be em ployed for gain save in work on the farm in the interval be tween school sessions It is also virtually agreed that there should 64The Child and the Law be regulation by law for children under sixteen at least such regulation including the prohibition of night work the shorten ing of the hours of labor by day and the protection of the chil dren against langerous machinery and against unsanitary and im moral conditions which the children naturally are helpless to remedy It is also virtually agreed in the experience of the nations of Europe and the American states that along with the prohibition of labor for children should go the compulsion to attend school Experience has also taught that a childlabor law is a law without a friend for its enforcement Employers parents and in some instances the children themselves are opposed to its enforcement The private citizen who attempts to investigate the evil may himself be convicted of trespass upon private property Therefore the absolute necessity of official factory and mine inspection with power to investigate and with power to prosecute the violators of the law In the light of this substantial agreement among civilized states and nations as to the standard of legislation and the methods of law enforcement let us see in a brief survey of the field how far the Southern States have advanced toward this standard It should be remembered in this connection that practically all advance has been within the last five years Kentucky Tennessee Louisiana and Arkansas have already reached the fourteenyear age limit though Arkansas permits children between the ages of twelve and fourteen who are or phans or the children of dependent parents to be employeda vicious exception of course to the general law Virginia reaches the thirteenyear age limit in I909 and the fourteenyear age limit in I910 North Carolina has fixed the thirteenyear age limit and a bill has been introduced into the North Carolina legislature now in session changing the age limit to fourteen South Carolina Florida Georgia Alabama Mississippi and Texas have a twelveyear age limit Georgia permits children between ten and twelve to be employed and South Carolina children of any age who are already handicapped by partial or complete orphanage Texas has an age limit of sixteen for mines and Oklahoma the same though the childlabor bill pro per after having passed the legislature of Oklahoma was vetoed by Governor Haskell for which action it may be remembered he was Presidentially rebuked These laws of the Southern 65The Annals of the American Academy States apply generally to child labor in factories only the evil being comparatively small as yet in mines and except in a few of the larger cities in mercantile establishments and in the street trades In regard to the hours of labor for the children who are allowed to work the tenhour day generally prevails though in Alabama and Tennessee it is a sixtyhour week which allows as in Pennsylvania more than a tenhour day and in Georgia and North Carolina a sixtysixhour week which with the usual halfholiday on Saturday given to employees in the cotton mills means a twelvehour day for the other days of the week Night work is prohibited for children under sixteen in Alabama and Mississippi in South Carolina and Florida for children under twelve and in the other Southern states for children under four teen As to compulsory attendance upon school Kentucky and Oklahoma have a compulsory law for children under fourteen Virginia for children under twelve North Carolina has a sort of local option compulsory attendance law which was enthusiastically advocated by the cotton manufacturers who at last accounts have unanimously neglected to put their own villages under the operation of the law The manufacturers of South Carolina this month agreed to advocate a compulsory education bill for children under four teen which is an advance of two years over their previous conces sion and to agree to the same age limit for the childlabor law if the compulsory education bill shall pass experience having demon strated that this is a tolerably safe condition for amending the child labor statute Georgia Alabama Arkansas and Texas have an age limit of fourteen for illiterate children while Alabama requires chil dren employed to attend school three months a year until they are sixteen and Georgia until they are eighteen So much for the standard of legislation to which the Southern States have attained The legislatures of several of these states are in session now or are to meet during the year and I trust that this review of the legislative status will become antiquated before it is printed Perhaps it may be said that the advance from no legisla tion at all to the present standard in the last six years has been more rapid than any similar advance in either America or Europe for a similarly large population But when we come to consider the enforcement of the law by the authorities or its observance by 66The Child and the Law those affected we may as well begin with the frank admission that there is almost no enforcement and that the violations even of the poorest laws we have are open shameless and innumerable Ex cept in Kentucky and Louisiana there have been no prosecutions for violation of the law so far as I have been able to learn The opportunities for nominal compliance with the law on the part of the employer while violating its spirit are abundant and for this the manufacturers are responsible through the compromises they have been able to write in the laws Only Kentucky and Lou isiana have anything like a fair system for issuing the certificates of employment In the other states the affidavit of the parent made before a magistrate who may himself be in the employ of the fac tory is deemed sufficient to insure accuracy In North Carolina only the written statement of the parent is required in South Carolina the certificate relates only to children under twelve Florida and Texas require no proof of age Virginia in her lately amended law however instead of the cumbersome and generally ineffective certifi cate system which is usually simply a means of protection to the employer added this short and sharp provision that the employ ment of children under the legal age should be deemed prima facie evidence of guilt on the part of both employer and parent That is at least a great deal better than the immunity bath in the laws of North and South Carolina recently slipped into the Alabama law that the employer must  knowingly and wilfully  violate its pro visions as to employing children under the legal age It is difficult to know certainly the age of other peoples children and where ignorance is immunity tis folly to be wise In the Carolinas especially in South Carolina where it is easy enough to employ the smallest children in accordance with law a child is not deemed employed when  helping  an older member of the family at piecework so long as the childs name does not appear on the payroll and he does not receive the wages himself Of course the difference of the effect of premature toil upon the child himself through the absence of his name from the payroll is obvious Before the passage of the childlabor law in Georgia the manufacturers who had entered into an agreement not to employ children under specified ages suborned their own consciences by a similar expedient The remedy for this is the provision that the child shall not be permitted to work in or about the place 67The Ainnals of the American Acadelmy of employment As to the certificates required by law they are almost wholly disregarded their protection not even being deemed necessary by the employers Again except in Kentucky and Louisiana there is no adequate provision for factory inspection Alabama has an inspector and an assistant who are  inspectors of jails and factories Thus far the inspectors office has been unable to cope with the task of factory inspection Tennessee and Virginia have the beginnings of a system of factory inspection and Mississippi requires the sheriff of each county and an officer of the board of health of each county to inspect the factories located within the county the sheriff being required to visit the factories once each month This may prove of temporary value in a rural state with few factories The North Carolina Labor Commissioner has no authority to enter a factory and the commis sioner whose term has expired made a regular report that he had no complaints as to the violations of the law As in the case of the death of the unpopular neighbor there was no complaint Every body concerned was satisfied In addition North Carolina South Carolina Georgia Florida Arkansas and Texas have no officials for investigating the facts as to the employment of children and only the ordinary processes of the law for the enforcement of the childlabor law Under these condi tions a low standard of legislation numerous loopholes in the laws that we have the general absence of factory inspection and of com pulsory education the great ally of childlabor legislation together with an urgent demand for labor in the cotton factories it would only be natural if the violations of the law were scandalous in their frequency I am able to prove this by ocular demonstration through the medium of the stereopticon or the photograph to any one not phy sically or morally blind During the year I908 investigations direct ed from our Southern office in Atlanta were made in Mississippi Alabama Georgia North and South Carolina and Virginia The Virginia manufacturers seemed more sensitive to public opinion and while violations even of the twelveyear age limit then in force were frequent few children were found at work who were under ten years of age Through the operation of the provisions requiring children under eighteen in Georgia and under sixteen in Alabama to attend school there was some show of observance of the law in 68The Child and the Law these two states Mississippi had no childlabor law at the time of the investigation and from the most careful comparison of the re ports of three different investigators in North Carolina and South Carolina two of them making photographic records I am convinced that the conditions while bad enough in Mississippi were no worse there in a state without law than in North Carolina with a thirteen year age limit and that they were worse in South Carolina than in either state or in any state of the Union for that matter except that North Carolina occupies the chief eminence for the employment of children at night and during a working night of twelve hours Many words could not make this plainer Children from seven years old upward were found at work in the mills children of ten years of age were found on the night shift Children of twelve and thirteen now beyond the protection of the law had been work ing in spite of its supposed protection since they were six or seven This is child labor from one point of view It is child murder from another point of view How the very respectable gentlemen who engage in it or the philanthropic stockholders who permit it can hope to escape the execration of mankind when the facts are known is beyond comprehension The Herods have not been popu lar in the judgment of history Another bad result of this lawlessness on the part of the em ployer is the example for the child of disobedience to law and the practice of deception While in the great majority of mill villages the amazing thing was the unconsciousness of wrongdoing of actual criminality on the part of the mill superintendents and the readi ness of the children and their parents to tell the truth about their ages in some mills where conditions were just as bad the children had been trained to lie In some of the mills the investigators were forbidden to take photographs on the premises or even to enter the mills And the practice has already begun in the South of preparing a mill for investigation when a visit is expected by hiding the chil dren or sending them away from the mill The effect of all this upon the childish mind need not be described But with the people of the South lawlessness finally works out its own cure The very openness and boldness of it finally brings its destruction The old KuKluxKlan which through lawlessness saved civilization finally degenerated in its operations to the aveng ing of personal injuries and presto it vanished from the face of 69The Annals of the American Academy the earth The night riders had their own way in Tennessee until the horrible murder which shocked the country was perpetrated and night riding will soon be abolished by way of the hempen cord The lynching of negro brutes has long been condoned as a neces sityis still so condoned in some quarters But all over the South beginning in Georgia after the Atlanta riots law and order leagues are being formed whose members undertake to denounce the crime of lynching wherever it occurs and to aid in the apprehension and prosecution of the offenders So it will be I am persuaded with the reign of lawlessness throughout the South today in the matter of the destruction of the lives and the health and the opportunities for usefulness and happiness of its thousands of little children If I could put our photographs into every Southern home if what I have said could reach the masses of our people I know because I know them that the response would be swift If the cotton mill owners themselves would realize the terrible effects of the child labor system which they are doing the most to perpetuate in this nation today especially in the South the most of them would begin housecleaning tonight or tomorrow morning at the latest And in conclusion I wish to sound again the warning to them that I made two years ago Already they have lost the moral en thusiasm of a good part of the Southern people that accompanied the tremendous advance of the cotton mill industry before the facts about child labor began to be known Already people all over the South are saying that they do not want a cotton mill in their own towns already investors who have some conscience about their dividends are looking to see if cotton mill money is not blood money But the cotton mill men are now asking the representatives of the people in Congress assembled for the continuation of the high duties on cotton goods and even for higher duties than now obtain A gen tleman from New England explained to the Tariff Commission the other day that the cotton mill was an infant industry that it was an infant industry in New England because that section had re cently changed from the manufacture of coarse goods to the manu facture of fine goods That it was an infant industry in the South because it had only in recent years begun to make cotton goods at all The same sentiment that it is an infant industry was echoed by a Southern cotton manufacturer at a meeting in Charleston giving the same reasons I desire to agree with the proposition as 7oThe Child and the Lawt I interpret it that the cotton mill business is an infant industry I am backed up in this opinion by the Census reports which say  To a greater extent than any other mechanical or manufacturing industry the cotton mill furnishes employment for children And it goes on to show that one employee of the Northern cotton mills out of ten is under sixteen years of age while in the South one out of three employees is a child and that the proportion of young chil dren employed is also greater in the South than in the North in stances being given in the Census of child breadwinners as young as five years of age There were a thousand recorded in 900oo who were under ten We cordially agree that the cotton mill business is an infant industry Now in all seriousness these representatives of the cotton mill interests come to the people of this nation through their representa tives in Congress and ask for protection and for more protection against their foreign competitors There would be a universal howl from them if the tariff laws were so violated or evaded as that pro tection should be denied them Is it not in order for the people through their representatives to say to the cotton mill men  Your industry is too much of an infant industry to suit our ideas of com mon humanity We are not debating the question whether we are willing to pay the same tax or a higher tax upon the cotton goods we purchase in order to give you protection But what we demand is that you give some protection to the thousands upon thousands of children who are now employed in the cotton mills of the East and of the South that you who are the only obstacle in the way of childlabor reform in the cotton manufacturing states should cease your opposition and change it to advocacy You are organized into your associations and you can easily act together The legisla tures that will deal with this matter are now in session or soon will be Let us see what the state legislatures will do before the tariff bill is finally framed by Congress More than this since a tariff law once being passed is of no value to you without the mighty machin ery of the Government at the CustomsHouse to enforce it see that you who are demanding protective legislation enforced by Govern ment shall give the same obedience to law that you demand of the foreign manufacturer or the domestic importer and that you protect these children of ours both from the enactment of defective laws 7t72 The Annals of the American Academy and from the violations of such laws as you have Come with clean hands asking from us this benefit Demanding from us protection for infant industries see that you cease the exploitation of infant industry and that you grant what you have so long denied protec tion to the children who toil in your mills

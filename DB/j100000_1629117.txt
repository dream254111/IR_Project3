simply be cause of the low terminal pressures of the engine at the lowest temperatures of its range It is this loss which is sought to be reduced by the seriesfluid engines and which so far as the thermodynamic and the dynamic questions are concerned may be actually saved in large degree The uncertainty remaining is that regarding costs safety and convenience Du Trembley about two generations ago built binaryvapor engines with ether as the secondary fluid for a line of trans oceanic steamers and broke the worlds records for his time in economy of power production but the compound engine came in and his secondary fluid proved danger ously inflammable He lost one of his ships Randolph  Elder bettered his rec ord and the matter dropped out of sight Later many inventors have gone through the same experience in one way or another Ether chloroform alcohol ammonia car bondisulphide and sulphurdioxide among other volatile substances have been tried usually with some apparent gain but never yet with permanent success Recently however Professor Josse at Berlin has again broken the worlds rec ord in heatengine operation by produc ing the horsepower with an expenditure of less than eight and a half pounds of moderately superheated steam per hour The experiment has been made with the utmost care and repeated under varying conditions until there can remain no doubt of the fact He further states that the steam and sulphurdioxide binaryvapor system adopted by him can be constructed at no greater cost than the standard triple expansion engine which it rivals that properly cared for it is not subject to in jury by corrosion as had been anticipated by engineers generally and that it can be safely insured against loss or accident through leakage If experience confirms this claim this means that the longsought utilization of the waste heat of the steam engine may be practically accomplished Time and experience will confirm or re fute these expectations and it is for time and experience to settle the ultimate ques tions of the engineer relative to cost re liability safety and net gain or loss by the substitution of the seriesvapor engine for the compound the singlefluid series engine R H THURSTON WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS OF A COURSE TO TRAIN MEN FOR WORK IN TECHNICAL CHEMISTRY THE subject before us may be discussed in two parts first what sort of instruction in chemistry should be given to men who are to become technical chemists and sec ond what work in other subjects should be required Our consideration of the question will perhaps be more definite if we have before us a list of the occupations followed by a number of young men who have received training of this sort During the past twelve years twenty three men have graduated from the chem ical course of the Rose Polytechnic Insti tute These have been employed as fol lows One is inspector of coke for a large steel company three are chemists in iron or steel laboratories two are assayers two are teachers three chemists in soap factories two employed by a firm manu facturing liquid carbon dioxide two are draftsmen one is superintendent of a gas company one chemist for a firm manu facturing photographic supplies one chem ist for a paint oil company one chemist for an electricalcompany one manager of the paint department for a wholesale  Read at the meeting of the Indiana College As sociation December 27 1901 and also at the Philadelphia meeting of the American Chemical Society SCIENCE 382MARCH 7 1902 house one chemist for a packing company one chemist in a testing laboratory and one in charge of the technical science de partment in a large library No doubt the list of graduates from other technical schools would show a sim ilar or even greater variety of occupa tions It is at once evident that it would have been impossible to fit these men for the specific occupations which they now follow Only in very rare instances could the occupation be predicted before gradua tion Work spent upon the details of tech nical processes would in the large major ity of cases have had no direct practical value When we consider the everbroad ening scope of the chemical knowledge of our time and the time limits which are practically set for the students work we cannot doubt that time spent in laying broad and solid foundations will be much more useful than any great amount of time given to the details of industrial chemis try At the basis of all must come a thorough training in analytical chemistry and es pecially in quantitative analysis While I think that the laboratory work should be gin with work in general chemistry and that should be followed by qualitative analysis no very large amount of time should be given to either by students who are to become chemists Fifteen hours a week for one half to two thirds of a school year should be sufficient The work given in general chemistry should be directed toward the illustration of fundamental principles and instruction in accurate ma nipulation with varied forms of apparatus rather than to a large amount of detailed demonstration of the properties of ele ments and compounds Beyond a very lim ited amount of the latter kind of study the attention of the student will weary and he will acquire the fatal habit of performing experiments as directed writing descrip tions in his notebook and straightway for getting all about them The same is even more true of some kinds of work often giv en in qualitative analysis The greater length of time required for quantitative operations and the comparative simplicity of the processes involved are better suited for training the beginner in the accurate memory of detail which is so useful for the chemist In the selection of topics in quantitative analysis I heartily believe in beginning with pure salts which give a rigorous test of the students accuracy After a limited number of such determinations however the students work is best directed to the analysis of various commercial products the object being to give as varied a train ing as possible and a knowledge of the most practical methods In general a reason able economy of the students time should be considered and long and tedious meth ads should not be used especially when shorter methods give as good or better re sults The determination of the principal constituents of iron and steel determina tion of iron copper zinc and lead in ores assaying for gold and silver the determi nations of sanitary water analysis coal analysis and gas analysis should be in cluded for every student One or more complex analyses as a clay analysis or an analysis of a mineral water are also very desirable and beyond this many special topics may be assigned to individual stu dents No hard and fast course should be laid down to be followed by all alike At some point the quantitative work should be broken off and a few weeks given to in organic preparations and a few weeks at some other point to organic preparations There should of course be lecture courses in general and organic chemistry and in the history and theories of chemistry The lecture work in physical chemistry should be supplemented by laboratory work SCIENCE 383lN S VOL XV No 375 It is the custom at all of our best tech nical schools to require a thesis for gradu ation This thesis should always be based on careful experimental work continued for some months It should if possible contain some real addition to the worlds knowledge The student cannot be ex pected to select independently a suitable topic Indeed where the higher degree of Doctor of Philosophy is concerned students rarely select their own subjects The wish of the students as to the nature of the topic should however be consulted Subjects pertaining to industrial chemistry are es pecially appropriate but topics pertaining to the pure science are not to be excluded and indeed are often to be preferred be cause of the broader and deeper insight which they give to the student Every technical school should hold before itself not only the purpose of giving to its stu dents a sound preparation for industrial pursuits but it should also contribute con stantly to the increase of knowledge in those fields with which it has to deal The reflex influence of such ideals on the in struction given is of the greatest possible importance The second phase of our question per tains to the accessory studies which the chemist should have There seems to be a very prevalent notion that a chemist needs very little mathematics With the rapid development of physical chemistry and the application of that branch of chemistry to technical problems which is soon to come if not already here such a view is no long er tenable Every chemist and indeed every one dealing with physical science should have at least a knowledge of the calculus In physics a thorough knowl edge of fundamental principles should be given and especial attention should be de voted to the subject of electricity The methods used by engineers in testing struc tural materials should be acquired by ac tual use of the instruments employed for the purpose Freehand and mechanical drawing are almost necessary and some work in machine design is very desirable In language a reading knowledge of Ger man and French should be acquired and the knowledge should be practically used in connection with current chemical jour nals Except for lack of time I should advocate some work in biology But while there are fields in industrial chemistry where some knowledge of biology is abso lutely essential and while all chemists should know something in a general way about bacteriology room can scarcely be found for these subjects without displac ing something of more vital importance In conclusion I would say that the acces sory subjects especially should not be slighted by the student If he becomes a chemist he will certainly learn a very great deal about chemistry after he leaves school but much of this other knowledge he is far less likely to acquire afterwards and very much of it he will find practically useful if it is at his

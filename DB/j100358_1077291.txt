j100358,The School Review,1077291,Vocational Guidance and Public Education,i244631,VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE AND PUBLIC EDUCATION PAUL H HANUS Harvard University At the First National Conference on Vocational Guidance held in Boston under the joint auspices of the Boston Vocation Bureau and the Boston Chamber of Commerce on November 15 and 16 I9IO several hundred persons were in attendance Fortyfive cities sent delegates including cities as widely sepa rated as New York Baltimore Pittsburg Chicago and Grand Rapids It is apparent that the problems of systematic voca tional guidance are attracting the attention their importance deserves These problems are of course not new But organization for systematic attention to them is very recent It has been stimulated by and is naturally associated with three important contemporary tendencies in public education These tendencies are really only different phases of one comprehensive movement for approximating more closely our democratic ideal of indi vidual welfare and social progress They are the safeguarding and promotion of bodily health and vigor by an important ex tension of the work of the departments of school hygiene and physical training in our schools the progressive establishment of public vocational schools of elementary and secondary grade that is of vocational schools other than professional schools for increasing the efficiency of all who work in industry agri culture or commerce and a widespread effort to make the non vocational schools we already have of every grade and kind more vitalthat is to make the pupils school life so significant a part of his whole life that it shall be and remain a guiding force no matter at what point his school life must clolse The increased attention to bodily health and strength in school is the natural concomitant of the awakened public interest in physical welfare not merely for its own sake but also as one 5ITHE SCHOOL REVIEW of our most important social resources Quite apart from the misery illhealth or physical weakness usually entails it is clear that economic efficiency depends on health hence the boards of health school physicians school nurses school meals for the needy openair schools supervised play and public playgrounds The establishment of elementary and secondary schools at public expense for the training of workers in our industries on our farms and in commerce is making decided progress Through out the country such schools are being discussed or are already actually established Notably in New York Massachusetts and Connecticut and in some of the western states the state is lend ing its aid to the maintenance of such schools and in each of these states public schools founded within the last five years are in operation similar schools founded by philanthropic and other agencies have rendered important service for years past Occa sionally also some large industrial or commercial establishments have provided themselves with schools for the training of the workers they need All such schoolsschools of commerce of industry of agriculture whether day schools parttime schools day or evening continuation schoolsare a response to the de mand for increasing economic efficiency without which indi vidual welfare and social progress are impossible The demand for public vocational schools would not have arisen if the existing public schools had supplied it It was believed and by some persons it is still believed that satisfactory vocational training can be provided by the traditional public schools although this possibility is widely questioned and many experiments are now under way to test this question These experiments will be watched with care as the vocational schools will be In the course of time we shall have had the experience we need to enable us to decide as to their intrinsic and relative value Such an examination of the aims and work of the traditional public schools is by no means new it is in fact perennial but the recent and contemporary interest in vocational education has reinforced it Hence the third marked tendency in educational activity todayan effort to make the school a more effective 52VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE AND PUBLIC EDUCATION factor in shaping the pupils career While enabling him to ap preciate the spiritual and the institutional political resources and problems of our age it should also render him responsive to our economic resources and problems and in particular bring home to him the importance and the dignity of work of all kinds as the foundation of all individual and social welfare This involves a reorganization of the subjectmatter of in struction of the teaching and of the management of the pupils Each study is to be seen by the pupil to be a bit of organized human experience and his mastery of it is to result in the power to be an effective participator and not merely a spectator in the worlds affairs At the same time the management or discipline of the school is to make the pupil progressively responsive to his duties as well as to his privileges At the outset he is completely dependent on his parents and teachers for moral insight and guidance but as his insight into his privileges and responsibilities develops he must shape his conduct in harmony therewith and do this more and more by his own volition It is the special task of the school to insure this result by the wisest discipline it can deviseby incentives and deterrents that so far as possible are seen by the pupil to possess a progressive and a permanent value In a word the demand today is to make culture dynamic not staticto make it not merely the valued possession of the indi vidual the means of promoting his bodily health and his intelli gence but also to shape his character to make him a living force in the economic political and spiritual progress of the social whole of which he is a partto enable him to do this as has been said not merely as preparation for life later on but as life itself so far as he can understand it to make the school that part of the pupils life at the time which makes all of it then and thereafter more significant and valuable This is the meaning of the contention that the work of the school shall be more vital and of the effort to make it so It is clear that with this tendency well established in the schools the question of vocational guidance is a pressing question Where this tendency is not yet marked vocational guidance is equally essential for there the pupil is likely to be quite helpless when 53THE SCHOOL REVIEW he makes the transition from school to vocationa momentous transition indeed This transition cannot be safe unless the choice of the pupils lifecareer is deliberate Even then mis takes will be made but we may expect that they will be small in number and importance as compared with the mistakes of ran dom choice or mere jobhunting A wise choice of a calling demands accessible opportunities of satisfactory preparation for it adaptation of personality and capacity and a knowledge of the conditions of employment and of the prospective rewards material spiritual and social of satisfactory work in it These are problems of vocational guid ance How much depends on their satisfactory solution for each ambitious youth both for himself and for society need not be dwelt upon What we must deplore now is the absence of such guidance for the great majority of each generation and the fact until quite recently we have been unconscious of our duty in this respect or at least that we have not endeavored to equip ourselves satisfactorily to discharge that duty It is the object of this paper to direct public attention to the need of voca tional guidance for the oncoming generation and to the duty of providing organized local plans for giving such guidance in as satisfactory a way as can be worked out Who the wisest vocation counselors may be in the end we cannot now say Perhaps the parents made conscious by their own vocational guidance in youth of its significance and impor tance and more responsive to their whole duty to their children in this respect than most of them have been in the past perhaps the employers of children and youth also rendered more respon sive to the permanent welfare of their employees than many of them now are and knowing better than anyone else the ad vantages and the limitations of the employment they offer per haps the teachers always solicitous for the future of their charges and rendered by some training for this work more com petent to cope with the difficult problems of vocational guidance than most of them now feel themselves to be perhaps a body of vocational counselors specially trained for the purposea body of men and women each of whom knows equally well the 54VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE AND PUBLIC EDUCATION children and youth whom they counsel and a group of employ ments open to them But whoever may be the wisest counselors in the end it is clear that we cannot wait to make a beginning There is too much at stake Our present duty is plain namely to seek to give to all these prospective and present counselors for they have been and they will continue to be vocational advisers the best available equipment for their responsibilities This is one of our most important tasks and one of the most difficult From what has been said it is clear that much preparation is needed by those on whom the duty of vocational guidance may fall Information must be had of the young people themselves their physical condition their capacity their ambitions the opportunities and circumstances of their lives similarly infor mation is needed about occupations their advantages and dis advantages in view of the natural and acquired equipment for them possessed by their prospective workers the kind of prepa ration required for them and the extent and quality of the available preparation for a progressive career in them and what success in them means To gather this information and make it available for use will require time and effort And to give satisfactory guidance by properly trained persons to the great body of young people whose lifework is now almost inevitably determined by chance will require an army of devoted workers Of course preparation for the transition from school life to lifework must be gradual That transition must be seen from afar by the pupil Vocational guidance cannot be safely de ferred until the pupil is on the threshold of the worlds work A satisfactory vocation must be a goal toward which his thoughts and ambitions have been directed during the entire period of his tutelage But the school must not permaturely narrow the pupils outlook or his educational opportunities Up to about fourteen years of age by statute in all pro gressive countries all children must go to school But when they are fourteen years old most of them must face the problem of how to make a living For some time they have been asking What am I to be  At this moment general or incidental voca tional information is no longer adequate It is accordingly a 55THE SCHOOL REVIEW culminating period for specific vocational guidance The counselor is not to tell the pupil now or at any time what voca tion to enter It is his duty to make sure that whatever vocation the pupil enters he enters it deliberately and with as full a knowledge of all that this step means as can be obtained The counselor does not prescribe a vocation which the pupil takes The pupil chooses his vocation after full consideration of all the factors and consequences of his choice Nevertheless the time for choice has come and the issues must be met It is clear by the way that one important duty of all the advisers of youth is to bring home to all who can be brought to see it the enormous value of more education for every capable pupil no matter when he leaves schooland no matter whether the chief purpose of the school he attends is to teach him how to live or how to make a living One valuable result of satis factory vocational counseling ought therefore to be to lengthen the period of education for all but the incurably dull or the per manently unambitious During the entire highschool period vocational insight and aims still require attention but another culminating period for specific vocational guidance comes at the close of the pupils secondaryschool career when all but a small percentage of those who remained in school four years after leaving the elementary school must begin to earn their living Beyond the school in the college the need of vocational guidance is by no means at an end All this means that throughout his entire school career the pupils vocational insight and vocational purposes should be pro gressively developed Throughout his entire school career as has been said he should be led to seek an answer to the question What am I to be And about the time he must leave school he ought to have an answer to the questions How can I best realize my ambitions What vocation ought I to choose Satisfactory answers to these questions are imperative An am bitious and capable man or woman in the wrong occupation is a perversion of individual opportunity and an irreparable waste of social resources 56

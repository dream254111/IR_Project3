IT IS WIDELY AS SUMED THAT A STATE HAS NO JURISDICTION TO TAX THINGS IN TRANSIT OR THINGS ONLY TEMPORARILY WITHIN ITS BORDERS OUR PROBLEM IS TO DISCOVER HOW FAR THIS STATEMENT IS JUSTIFIED BY THE DECISIONS OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT AND TO FIND THE CONSIDERATIONS WHICH UNDERLIE THE COURTS ATTITUDE TOWARD THE TAXATION OF THINGS IN TRANSIT AND THINGS WHOSE PRESENCE IS EPHEMERAL MORE SPECIFICALLY WE WISH TO KNOW WHETHER THE SU PREME COURT HAS BEEN DEALINGWITH THE ISSUES IN THE LIGHT OF ITS CONCEPTION OF SITUS SO THAT ITS DECISIONS BELONG TO THE GENERAL LAW OF JURISDICTION TO TAX OR WHETHER IT HAS BEEN THINKING OF SITUS ONLY WHEN IT WAS FORMALLY INTERPRETING THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT SO THAT ITS DECISIONS UNDER THE COMMERCE CLAUSE ARE THE PRIVATE PRESERVE OF THE STUDENT OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW UPON WHICH THE STUDENT OF CONFLICT OF LAWS MAY ENTER ONLY AS A GUEST IS THE BOTTOM GROUND OF EXEMPTION FROM TAXATION TO BE FOUND IN THE FACT OF INTERSTATE TRANSIT OR IS INTERSTATE TRANSIT SIGNIFICANT ONLY AS EVIDENCE OF TEMPORARY STAY WHERE THE TRANSIT IS SO BROKEN THAT THE COMMERCE CLAUSE DOES NOT CONFER EXEMPTION DOES IT FOLLOW NECESSARILY THAT THE VISITING CHATTEL HAS ACQUIRED A SITUS WITH ITS TEMPORARY HOST OR MAY IT STILL RELY ON THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT FOR PROTECTION AGAINST PAYING FOR A YEAR WHEN IT IS PRESENT ONLY FOR A WEEK 1 FOR THE PRECEDING INSTALMENTS

ITSELF A GROUND OF EXEMPTION PROPERTY HAS NEVER BEEN IMMUNE FROM TAXATION BECAUSE EMPLOYED IN INTERSTATE COM MERCE SUCH EMPLOYMENT OFTEN OCCURS WITHOUT ANY ABSENCE FROM HOME TIES AND TRACKS AND STATIONS AND BRIDGES ARE AGEN CIES OF INTERSTATE COMMERCE WHICH REMAIN ALWAYS IN THE SAME PLACE CARS AND ENGINES MAY BE USED CONSTANTLY IN INTERSTATE COMMERCE AND YET NEVER DEPART FROM THE JURISDICTION IN WHICH THEY ORIGINATE ALL SUCH PROPERTY PERMANENTLY WITHIN A SINGLE JURISDICTION IS TAXABLE TO THE SAME EXTENT AS PROPERTY WHOLLY WITHOUT THE FOLD OF THE COMMERCE CLAUSE2 NEITHER USE IN IN TERSTATE COMMERCE NOR MOTION IN INTERSTATE COMMERCE IS IN IT SELF A SHIELD AGAINST TAXATION WHEREVER PERIPATETIC PROPERTY HAS FOUND SUCH A SHIELD IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN PRESENT ONLY TEMPO RARILY IN THE JURISDICTION AGAINST WHICH THE SHIELD HAS BEEN A BARRIER SHIPS HAVE ESCAPED FROM TAXATION AT THE PORTS AT WHICH THEY MERELY STOPPED TEMPORARILY IN THE COURSE OF THEIR INTER STATE TRANSIT3 LOGS 4 AND SHEEP5 HAVE ESCAPED WHILE ON THEIR WAY THROUGH AN INTERMEDIATE JURISDICTION BETWEEN THEIR PLACE OF ORIGIN AND THEIR DESTINATION IN ALL THESE CASES THERE HAS BEEN BOTH INTERSTATE TRANSIT AND LACK OF PERMANENT PRESENCE THE FORMER INDEED INVOLVES THE LATTER A CASE MIGHT BE IMAGINED IN WHICH PROPERTY IN CONTINUOUS INTERSTATE TRANSIT MIGHT BE WITHIN A SINGLE JURISDICTION FOR AN ENTIRE TAX PERIOD AND THUS SATISFY THE REQUIREMENT OF PERMANENT PRESENCE AS THE TERM IS USED IN THE LAW OF JURISDICTION TO TAX THE CLASSIC CLASSROOM 2 SEE MR JUSTICE FIELD IN GLOUCESTER FERRY CO V PENNSYLVANIA 1885 114 U S

THAT THE PROPERTY WAS SOON TO LEAVE THE EXEMPTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN GRANTED THUS AFFORD NO BASIS FOR BELIEVING THAT PROP ERTY ENJOYS ANY IMMUNITY FROM TAXATION MERELY BECAUSE IT IS IN THE COURSE OF INTERSTATE TRANSIT WHEN WE TURN TO THE CASES IN WHICH EXEMPTION HAS BEEN DE NIED WE FIND PROOF POSITIVE THAT INTERSTATE TRANSIT ALONE DOES NOT CONFER IMMUNITY IN THE LEADING CASE WHICH EXEMPTED SHIPS FROM TAXATION AT A PORT WHICH THEY TOUCHED FOR A BRIEF STOP IT WAS DECLARED THAT THEY WERE THERE BUT TEMPORARILY ENGAGED IN LAWFUL TRADE AND COMMERCE WITH THEIR SITUS AT THEIR HOME PORT WHERE THE VESSELS BELONGED AND WHERE THEIR OWNERS WERE LIABLE TO BE TAXED FOR THE CAPITAL INVESTED AND WHERE THE TAXES HAD BEEN PAID 6 THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT PROPERTY IN CONTINUOUS INTERSTATE TRANSIT MIGHT BE TAXED AT THE DOMICIL OF ITS OWNER IF IT ACQUIRED NO ACTUAL SITUS ELSEWHERE AND EVEN THIS QUALIFICATION WAS ADDED ONLY OVER THE DISSENT OF TWO MEMBERS OF THE COURT7 THE QUALIFICATION ITSELF POSITS TAXABILITY OF PROPERTY IN INTER STATE TRANSIT AWAY FROM THE DOMICIL OF ITS OWNER PROVIDED IT CAN SATISFY THE REQUISITE OF SITUS THIS REQUISITE IS SATISFIED WHEN THE TAXING JURISDICTION CONFINES ITSELF

INTERSTATE TRANSIT IS IMMATERIAL THUS IT APPEARS THAT INTERSTATE TRANSIT FAILS TO EXEMPT WHERE IN ANY WAY THE REQUIREMENT OF SITUS IS COMPLIED WITH IT SEEMS THEREFORE THAT PROPERTY IS EXEMPTED NOT BECAUSE IT IS IN INTERSTATE TRANSIT BUT BECAUSE ITS TRANSIT SHOWS THAT ITS STAY IS EPHEMERAL THE TRANSIT MAKES IT CERTAIN THAT A TAX IS GUILTY OF A TEMPORAL FORM OF THE VICE OF EXTRATERRITORIALITY LOOKED AT FROM THE STAND POINT OF A YEAR AND NOT OF A DAY ONLY THE ASSESSOR IS COVETING HIS NEIGHBORS GOODS A POSSIBLE QUALIFICATION OF THIS ANALYSIS IS TO BE NOTED IF WE MAY RELY ON OBITER DICTUM IT

WHERE THEY HAD ALWAYS BEEN PROVIDED THEY WERE ALREADY STARTED ON AN INTERSTATE JOURNEY AS TO THE GRAIN THIS DICTUM IN NO WAY MILI TATES AGAINST OUR ANALYSIS THAT INTERSTATE TRANSIT EXEMPTS ONLY WHEN

NOTE 11 SUPRA 1 THAT THIS ASSUMPTION IS WARRANTED SEEMS EVIDENT FROM THE FACT THAT IN ALL THE CASES THE INQUIRY MADE BY THE COURTS RELATES TO THE FUTURE SITU ATION OF THE PROPERTY RATHER THAN TO THE PAST I HAVE FOUND NO CASE IN WHICH A CLAIM TO EXEMPTION WAS PREDICATED ON THE FACT THAT THE PROP ERTY WAS OF RECENT ORIGIN OR HAD BUT RECENTLY COME INTO THE JURISDICTION NOR ANY CASE IN WHICH PROPERTY

THERE IF ALL THE STATES HAVE THE SAME TAX DAY THE DEPARTING OR VISITING PROP ERTY WILL ESCAPE TAXATION FOR A YEAR IF IT IS NOT TAXED AT THE DOM ICIL OF ITS OWNER SUCH A PRINCIPLE MIGHT MAKE IT WORTH

A RULE THAT WOULD PERMIT ANY TANGIBLE PROPERTY TO ESCAPE TAXATION FOR A YEAR DISRELISH FOR SUCH A RESULT HAS MOVED THE SUPREME COURT TO ALLOW SHIPS TO BE TAXED AT THE DOMICIL OF THEIR OWNER THOUGH THEY MAY NEVER VISIT THAT DOMI CIL14 IT IS NOT EASY TO SQUARE THIS DICTTUM IN BACON V ILLINOIS 15 WITH THE POLICY UNDERLYING THE ACTUAL DECISIONS OF THE COURT IN THE PRESENCE OF AN APPARENT DILEMMA CREATED BY A SITUATION IN WHICH THE STATE DOES NOT DESERVE THE TAX BUT THE OWNER DOES NOT DESERVE EXEMPTION FROM IT THE COURT HAS COMMONLY PREFERRED TO FAVOR THE STATE RATHER THAN THE OWNER THE OBJECTION TO THIS DICTUM IN BACON V ILLINOIS 16 DEPENDS FOR ITS STRENGTH UPON THE ASSUMPTION THAT ALL THE STATES HAVE THE SAME TAX DAY IN THE CASES INVOLVING THE NEW YORK CENTRAL 17 AND THE SOUTHERN PACIFIC18 IT WAS THOUGHT THAT THE CARS AND THE SHIPS WOULD ESCAPE ENTIRELY IF THEY WERE NOT TAXED AT THE DOMICIL OF THEIR OWNER THEY WERE NOT IN THE COURSE OF A SINGLE MOVE FROM ONE PLACE OF REST TO ANOTHER AS WERE THE GRAIN AND THE OIL AND THE LOGS THESE COMMODITIES MIGHT POSSIBLY BE TAXED IN ANOTHER JURISDICTION THE FOLLOWING MONTH AS SOON AS THEY CAME TO REST AND WERE SOLD OR OFFERED FOR SALE

PROPERTY MAY PAY NO TAX AT ALL THE NICE DECISION OF SUCH AN ISSUE WOULD VARY ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF THE VARIOUS STATES BUT IF THE DICTUM OF BACON V ILLINOIS 20 SHOULD BECOME ESTABLISHED BY DECISION THE EVENTUATION WOULD NOT SHAKE THE PRINCIPLE THAT INTERSTATE TRANSIT EXEMPTS FROM TAXATION ONLY WHEN IT IS SURE PROOF THAT THE PROPERTY IS ONLY TEMPORARILY PRESENT IT WOULD REQUIRE NO MODIFICATION OF ANY CONCLUSION AS TO THE RE LATION BETWEEN THE COMMERCE CLAUSE AND THE CONCEPTION OF SITUS WHEN POWER TO TAX IS NECESSARILY PREDICATED ON PRESENCE OF THE PROPERTY ON TAX DAY IT WOULD INDICATE MERELY A NEW INSTANCE IN WHICH POWER TO TAX BASED ON POWER OVER THE OWNER MUST YIELD TO OTHER CONSIDERATIONS THIS WOULD IN SUBSTANCE ADD TO EXEMPTION ON THE GROUND OF AN ACTUAL SITUS ELSEWHERE EXEMPTION BECAUSE OF THE CERTAINTY OF SOON ACQUIRING SUCH AN ACTUAL SITUS ELSEWHERE AND THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE NEWLYACQUIRED SITUS WOULD RESULT IN IMMEDIATE TAXATION IT WOULD NOT SHAKE OUR BELIEF THAT EXEMPTIONS OF THINGS IN TRANSIT UNDER THE COMMERCE CLAUSE DE PEND UPON AND ARE LIMITED BY CONSIDERATIONS OF EXTRATERRITORIAL ITY EVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT AFFORD AN INSTANCE IN WHICH THE COM MERCE CLAUSE EXEMPTS THINGS IN TRANSIT THAT ARE ENCUMBERED WITH A TECHNICAL SITUS SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT THIS BRINGS US TO THE PROBLEM PRESENTED BY THE CASES IN WHICH EXEMPTIONS CLAIMED UNDER THE COMMERCE CLAUSE WERE DENIED ON THE GROUND THAT INTERSTATE TRANSIT HAD NOT BEGUN OR HAD ENDED OR HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED IN AN INTERMEDIATE JURISDICTION FOR SOME INDEPENDENT PURPOSE21 DO THESE CASES REPRESENT THE SUPREME COURTS CONCEPTION OF SITUS OR ARE THEY INDEPENDENT THEREOF DOES THE ABSENCE OF INTERSTATE TRANSIT GO MERELY TO THE INTERPRE TATION OF THE COMMERCE CLAUSE OR IS IT ALSO

OF INTERSTATE TRANSIT THEN MADE IT UN CERTAIN WHETHER THE LOGS WOULD LATER LEAVE THIS INDICATES THAT THE TAX WAS REGARDED AS ONE FOR THE PERIOD FOLLOWING THE DATE OF LEVY AND THAT ON THE FACTS AS OF THAT DATE THE COURT WAS NOT CONVINCED THAT THE PRESENCE OF THE PROPERTY WAS EPHEMERAL IN DIAMOND MATCH CO V ONTONAGON24 IN WHICH ALSO LOGS WERE HELD TAXABLE IN THE STATE OF THEIR ORIGIN IT APPEARED

ITS FACTS DOES NOT CUT INTO THE CONCLUSION THAT WHERE MIGRATORY PROPERTY HAS UNSUCCESSFULLY CLAIMED EXEMPTION FROM TAXATION AS A THING IN TRANSIT IT HAS BEEN UNABLE TO PROVE THAT ON TAX DAY IT WAS CERTAIN THAT ITS PRESENCE WAS TO BE ONLY TEMPORARY FOR THE TAX BEFORE THE COURT WAS NOT A PROPERTY TAX IT WAS NOT AN AD VALOREM TAX FOR A YEAR BUT WAS AN EX CISE FOR HAVING A CERTAIN KIND OF PROPERTY

IN DOMESTIC OR INTERSTATE COMMERCE 506TAXATION OF THINGS IN TRANSIT ICIL OF THE OWNER DOES NOT CREATE THE SITUTS REQUISITE TO LEVY A TAX FOR A YEAR IN EVERY CASE IN WHICH THE COMMERCE CLAUSE HAS EX EMPTED BECAUSE OF TRANSIT IT WAS CERTAIN THAT THE PROPERTY WAS SOON TO ABSCOND IN EVERY CASE IN WHICH THE COMMERCE CLAUSE HAS WITHHELD EXEMPTION FROM A GENERAL PROPERTY TAX BECAUSE THE TRANSIT WAS THOUGHT TO BE BROKEN THERE WAS NO CERTAIN ASSURANCE ON TAX DAY THAT THE PROPERTY WOULD SOON DEPART THIS ANALYSIS HOWEVER TAKES TOO NARROW AND LEGALISTIC A VIEW FOR OUR PRESENT PURPOSE OUR INTEREST IS NOT CONFINED TO WHAT THE SUPREME COURT HAS ACTUALLY DONE WE WISH TO KNOW WHAT IT IS LIKELY TO DO IN THE VARIOUS CONTINGENCIES THAT MAY ARISE IN THE FUTURE FROM THE STANDPOINT OF PROPHECY WHAT THE SUPREME COURT CHOOSES TO THINK THAT IT IS DOING IS OFTEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES AND IN THE GENERAL OIL CASE IT CHOSE TO PROCEED AS THOUGH IT WERE PASSING ON A GENERAL PROPERTY TAX THE CASES CITED IN SUPPORT OF ITS DECISIONS ARE CASES SUSTAINING A GENERAL PROPERTY TAX THE OPINION THERE FORE INDICATES THE BELIEF OF THE SUPREME COURT THAT THE COM MERCE CLAUSE PERMITS THE TAXATION OF PROPERTY ONLY TEMPORARILY PRESENT IN A JURISDICTION BETWEEN ITS PLACES OF ORIGIN AND OF DES TINATION PROVIDED THE PRESENCE IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENJOYING SOME LOCAL FACILITY NOT MERELY CONTRIBUTORY TO INTERSTATE TRANSIT SINCE THE OIL IN QUESTION WAS ALREADY SOLD TO PURCHASERS BEYOND TENNESSEE ITS DELAY IN TENNESSEE EVEN IF FOR AN INDEPENDENT BUSINESS PURPOSE AS THE MAJORITY INSIST WAS STILL CERTAIN TO BE A DELAY OF BRIEF DURATION SO THE MAJORITY IN DRAWING THE LINE BE TWEEN TRANSIT AND BREAK IN TRANSIT DO NOT MAKE IT RUN BETWEEN CERTAINTY AND UNCERTAINTY WHETHER THE PROPERTY IS SOON TO GO ON THEY ARE GUIDED BY THE PURPOSE OF A HALT IN TRANSIT AND NOT BY ITS DURATION THIS HOWEVER DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE QUESTION OF TRANSIT UNDER THE COMMERCE CLAUSE DIFFERS FROM THE QUESTION OF SITUS UN DER DUE PROCESS OF LAW THE SUPREME COURT MAY STILL BE INTER PRETING THE COMMERCE CLAUSE IN THE LIGHT OF ITS CONCEPTION OF SITUS THIS CONCEPTION MAY BE THAT SITUS MAY BE ACQUIRED BY ANY

REVIEW TAX FOR A YEAR NEVERTHELESS DOES NOT PREVENT THE ACQUISITION OF SITUS IF TO TEMPORARY PRESENCE IS ADDED SOME SPECIAL ADVANTAGE THEREFROM THUS BY DIVERSIFYING SOMEWHAT THE CONCEPT OF SITUS WE

FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT AS TO JURISDICTION TO TAX THINGS ONLY TEMPORARILY PRESENT A DIFFERENCE MAY PERHAPS HAVE TO BE RECOGNIZED WITH RESPECT TO PROPERTY AT THE DOMICIL OF ITS OWNER BUT SO FAR AT LEAST AS SITUS IS DEPENDENT UPON POWER OVER THE PROPERTY RATHER THAN OVER ITS OWNER WE ARE ENTITLED TO ASSUME THAT THE CASES ON THINGS IN TRANSIT REPRESENT THE SUPREME COURTS CONCEPTION OF SITUS UNLESS AND UNTIL WE FIND THE COURT HOLDING THAT DUE PROCESS OF LAW FORBIDS THE TAXATION OF THINGS ENJOYING SPECIAL ADVANTAGES FROM TEMPORARY PRESENCE NO SUCH APPLICATION OF THE DUEPROCESS CLAUSE HAS THUS FAR BEEN MADE BY THE SUPREME COURT WE HAVE NO CERTAIN JUSTIFI CATION FOR ASSUMING THAT CHATTELS WHICH FAILED TO SECURE EXEMP TION UNDER THE COMMERCE CLAUSE WOULD HAVE FARED BETTER HAD THEY ADDUCED THE

THE PROPERTY HAD LOST ITS SITUS AT THE DOMICIL OF ITS OWNER THE MAJORITY PUT THE BURDEN ON THE OWNER RATHER THAN ON THE TAXING AUTHORITY AND THOUGHT THAT THE OWNER HAD NEITHER MET THAT BURDEN NOR PROP ERLY RAISED THE ISSUE WHILE THIS DOES NOT CONCLUSIVELY SHATTER A FOND HOPE THAT SOMETHING OTHER THAN TRANSIT MAY PROVE THAT THE PRESENCE OF PROPERTY IS NOT SUCH AS TO GIVE IT A SITUS THE FACT THAT THE MAJORITY WERE UNQUESTIONABLY QUESTIONABLY TECHNICAL IN REFUSING TO CONSIDER THE DOCTRINE OF THE MINORITY INCLINES ONE TO INFER A DISAPPROVAL OF THAT DOCTRINE TRUE THE MAJORITY OPIN ION NEITHER

WHICH IT WAS HELD NO DISCRIMINATION AGAINST NONRESIDENTS TO TAX THEM IN THE SAME WAY AS RESIDENTS NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROBABILITY THAT THEIR USE OF THE NEW JERSEY ROADS WOULD BE MUCH LESS THAN THAT OF RESIDENTS AN EXCISE OF THIS CHARACTER LIKE THE INSPECTION TAX SUSTAINED IN GENERAL OIL CO V CRAIN47 IS DOUBTLESS IMMUNE FROM RESTRICTIONS THAT MAY BE THOUGHT APPROPRIATE FOR A GENERAL PROPERTY TAX SO THAT THE CASE ON ITS FACTS GOES NO FURTHER THAN THE GENERAL OIL CASE EXCEPT TO INDICATE THAT A DUEPROCESS COM PLAINT ADDS NOTHING TO ONE FOUNDED ON THE COMMERCE CLAUSE THIS INDICATION IS NOT EXPLICIT

WHICH THE DEFENCE TO THE TAX WAS NOT INTERSTATE TRANSIT BUT TEMPORARY PRESENCE IN DEPENDENT OF TRANSIT WHAT MAKES THE CASE IMPORTANT IS THE FACT THAT THE OPINION OF THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS TREATS THE PROB LEM AS IDENTICAL WITH THAT PRESENTED BY PROPERTY TAXES AND DE CLARES THAT IT IS WELL ESTABLISHED THAT TAXATION OF PERSONAL PROP ERTY WHICH MAY BE TEMPORARILY WITHIN A STATE BUT USED THEREIN FOR PROFIT IS LAWFUL ALTHOUGH THE OWNER HAS HIS DOMICIL IN AN OTHER STATE 50 EARLIER AFTER REVIEWING SOME STATE CASES IT DENIED THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY PROVIDE THAT EVERY PERSON WHO IS FOUND IN A

COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA AND WAS EVIDENTLY BROUGHT UNDER THE ADMIRALTY JURISDICTION TO RECOVER FOR AN ALLEGED BREACH OF A MARITIME CONTRACT SINCE THE LIBELANT CHOSE TO GO FROM THE

SUPREME COURT AND PER MITTING THE SUPREME COURT TO ISSUE WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURTS OF APPEAL THESE WAYS TO THE SUPREME COURT ARE NOT WAYS TO WHICH A LITIGANT IS ENTITLED AS OF RIGHT THE ONLY CASE I HAVE FOUND IN WHICH AN APPEAL WAS ATTEMPTED FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS TO THE SUPREME COURT IN AN ADMIRALTY CASE IS OREGON R  N R CO V BALFOUR 1900 179 U S 55 21 SUP CT 28 IN

QUOTED IN NOTE 52 SUPRA THOUGH I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO FIND A CASE ON THE POINT THE SECTION MAKES THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FINAL IN ALL ADMIRALTY CASES THUS DRAWING A DISTINCTION BETWEEN ADMIRALTY CASES AND CASES ARISING ON DIVERSITY OF CITIZENSHIP JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURTS OF APPEALS IN THE LATTER CLASS OF CASES ARE FINAL ONLY WHEN JURISDICTION IS DEPENDENT EXCLUSIVELY

AN APPEAL DIRECTLY TO THE SU PREME COURT AFTER HIS FIRST DEFEAT54 AS THE SITUATION STANDS THE SUPREME COURT MAY HAVE DENIED CERTIORARI BECAUSE IT THOUGHT THE PARTICULAR DISPUTE NOT IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO BE BOTHERED WITH THAT AUGUST BODY MAY BE LESS INTERESTED IN OUR INQUIRY THAN WE AT PRESENT ARE REQUIRED TO BE HERE WAS A BEAUTIFUL CHANCE TO SETTLE EXPLICITLY WHETHER EMPLOYMENT FOR PROFIT CONFERS SITUS AND JURISDICTION TO TAX EVEN WHEN IT IS CERTAIN THAT THE EMPLOYMENT IS FOR A BRIEF PERIOD AND TO TELL US WHETHER THE LITIGANTS WHO HAVE LOST OUT UNDER THE COMMERCE CLAUSE WOULD HAVE BEEN LEFT EQUALLY DISCONSOLATE HAD THEY RELIED ON THE FOURTEENTH AMEND MENT AS WELL THOUGH THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR AN EXPLICIT SETTLE MENT WAS NOT AVAILED OF THE SUPREME COURT BY TURNING A DEAF EAR ENTITLES US

JUDGE HUNT IN ANSWER TO MR HEDENSKOY IN TWO OF THEM IT IS NOT CERTAIN THAT A CONSTI TUTIONAL ISSUE WAS DULY RAISED THOUGH PLAINLY ENOUGH THE ISSUE WAS THERE A STUDY OF MANY STATE CASES ON THINGS IN TRANSIT AND THINGS TEMPORARILY PRESENT TEMPTS ONE TO SUGGEST THAT STATE JUDGES BE SENT TO SCHOOL IN ORDER TO LEARN THE WISDOM OF STATING EXPLICITLY IN THEIR OPINIONS THE PRECISE GROUNDS ON WHICH RELIEF IS INVOKED SO THAT WE MAY KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE DECIDING QUESTIONS OF DUE PROCESS OF LAW OR ARE INTERPRETING THE COM MERCE CLAUSE OR ARE CONTENTING THEMSELVES WITH STATUTORY CON STRUCTION ONE

CONSTRUCTION THE PROP ERTY HAD BEEN ASSESSED IN TEXAS IN JANUARY 1901 AND WAS RE QUIRED TO PAY A TAX IN LOUISIANA ON JUNE 24TH OF THE SAME YEAR HERE IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT THE ISSUE OF SITUS WAS SO RAISED AS TO MAKE THE DECISION AN INTERPRETATION OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF DUE PROCESS OF LAW READERS WILL SYMPATHIZE WITH JUDGE PROVOSTYS PERPLEXITY WHEN HE TELLS US IF THE CONTENTION IS THAT THIS PROPERTY HAVING BEEN BROUGHT HERE BUT RECENTLY AND BEING HERE BUT TEMPORARILY HAS NOT SUCH A SITUS HERE AS WILL JUSTIFY ITS TAXATIONAND WE AS SUME THAT THIS IS THE MAIN RELIANCE OF THE LEARNED COUNSEL FOR THE PLAINTIFFA QUESTION IS RAISED ON WHICH WE FIND THE LAW TO BE IN A STATE OF CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY PROPERTY IN TRANSITUL MAY NOT BE TAXED AND PROPERTY HAVING A SITUS MAY BUT AT WHAT POINT DOES PROPERTY PASS FROM THE STAGE OF TRANSIT TO THAT OF SUCH PERMANENCY AS WILL JUSTIFY TAXA TION BY WHAT CHARACTERISTICS IS A STATE OF TRANSIT TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM A STATE OF PERMANENCY FOR THE SOLU TION OF THIS QUESTION NO RULE HAS AS YET BEEN FORMULATED AND PERHAPS IN THE NATURE OF THINGS NONE CAN BE THE QUES TION BEING ONE MORE OF FACT THAN OF LAW AND THE ADJUDICA TIONS DO NOT FURNISH MUCH ASSISTANCE 60 IF WE CANNOT HAVE A RULE WE CAN STILL HAVE A NUMBER OF HELPFUL TESTS AND THE LEARNED JUDGE THEN GOES ON TO GIVE ONE WHICH HE THINKS HAS THE APPROVAL OF THE SUPREME COURT ON THE OTHER HAND THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES IN THE CASE OF BROWN V HOUSTON SUPRA CIT AND THIS COURT IN THE SAME CASE 33 ANN 843 SEEM TO HAVE REGARDED THE FACT THAT THE PROPERTY HAD BEEN BROUGHT

THE REST OF THE PROP ERTY IN NO RESPECT EXCEPT IN THE INTENTION OF THE OWNER TO RE MOVE IT AT SOME FUTURE TIME MORE OR LESS DISTANT UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES ITS SITUS APPROACHED NEARER TO PERMA NENCY THAN DID THAT OF THE SHEEP IN THE WYOMING CASE OR THAT OF THE COAL IN THE BROWN V HOUSTON CASE 61 WHILE HERE IS THE INTIMATION OF ABSENCE OF SATISFACTORY PROOF THAT THE PRESENCE OF THE PROPERTY WAS TEMPORARY THERE IS ALSO THE CLEAR INDICATION THAT PROPERTY ACQUIRES A SITUS IN A STATE BY BEING USED THEREIN MORE IMPORTANT STILL IS THE UNDERSTANDING OF JUDGE PROVOSTY THAT THE SUPREME COURTS DECISION IN BROWN V HOUSTON 62 THAT THE COAL HAD CEASED ITS TRANSIT AND THUS LOST ITS EXEMPTION UNDER THE COMMERCE CLAUSE NECESSARILY MEANS THAT IT HAD ACQUIRED A SITUS WHICH WOULD SATISFY THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT OR AS JUDGE HUNT INTERPRETS THE DECISION THE DOCTRINE RECOGNIZED IS THAT IF THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THE PRESENCE OF THE PERSONAL PROPERTY IS TO DEVOTE IT TO A USE WITHIN THE STATE TO WHICH IT HAS BEEN REMOVED THEN IT HAS A TAXABLE SITUS WITHIN THE STATE 63 WE REACH THEN THE CONCLUSION THAT WHERE THE SUPREME COURT HAS HELD TRANSIT BROKEN SUFFICIENTLY TO DEPRIVE PROPERTY OF THE PROTECTION OF THE COMMERCE CLAUSE IT HAS BEEN OF THE OPINION THAT SITUS WAS ACQUIRED SO THAT THE TAX WOULD NOT OFFEND THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT THOUGH THE OPINIONS HAVE POINTED OUT THAT ON TAX DAY IT COULD NOT BE CERTAIN THAT THE PROPERTY WAS TO LEAVE THE STATE THE JUDGES HAVE KNOWN WELL ENOUGH THAT IN FACT THEY WERE PERMITTING THE STATES TO TAX PROPERTY ONLY TEM PORARILY PRESENT THIS COMES OUT

INTO THE STATE FOR SOME TEMPORARY BENEFIT BEEN INCLUDED THE TAX IMPOSED ON LIVE STOCK AS SOON AS IT CAME IN TO GRAZE WOULD HAVE BEEN SUSTAINED THUS WE SEE A GENERAL CONSENSUS THAT PROPERTY MAY ACQUIRE A SITUS BY TEMPORARY PRESENCE PLUS THE REQUISITE BENEFITS FROM SUCH PRESENCE IN ALL THE SUPREME COURT DECISIONS IN WHICH THE COMMERCE CLAUSE WAS HELD NOT TO EXEMPT THINGS ALLEGED TO BE IN TRANSIT BECAUSE THE TRANSIT WAS HELD TO BE INTERRUPTED THE INTER RUPTION WAS FOR SOME BENEFICIAL PURPOSE WE MAY PRETTY CONFI DENTLY TAKE THESE DECISIONS TO REPRESENT THE SUPREME COURTS CONVICTION THAT THIS BENEFICIAL USE OF LOCAL FACILITIES CONFERRED UPON THE PROPERTY THE SITUS REQUIRED BY THE FOURTEENTH AMEND MENT THUS THE CASES ARE FOOD FOR THE STUDENT OF CONFLICT OF LAWS AS WELL AS FOR THE STUDENT OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW FOR THE LATTER THEY ARE PRACTICALLY THOUGH NOT TECHNICALLY PRECEDENTS FOR THE INTERPRETATION OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT AS WELL AS OF THE COMMERCE CLAUSE SINCE THE APPLICATIONS OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT TO ISSUES OF SITUS DEPEND UPON THE SUPREME COURTS IDEA OF THE PROPER PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICT OF LAWS SUCH APPLICA TIONS ARE SAUCE FOR THE STUDENT OF THAT SUBJECT IT IS TO BE

QUIRES EVEN A BENEFICIAL PURPOSE IN ORDER TO TAX VISITORS WHO HAVE ONLY THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT AS A POSSIBLE SHIELD SO FAR AS ITS ACTUAL DECISIONS GO THE SUPREME COURT IS STILL FREE TO HOLD THAT TEMPORARY PRESENCE IS ALL THAT IS NECESSARY TO GIVE SITUS OUR CONCLUSION THAT IN ALL THE CASES IN WHICH THE SUPREME COURT HAS HELD INTERSTATE TRANSIT ENDED OR INTERRUPTED IT HAS HAS BEEN CONVINCED THAT THE PROPERTY HAD ACQUIRED A SITUS AND THAT THERE FORE SUCH PROPERTY WOULD HAVE FARED NO BETTER UNDER THE FOUR TEENTH AMENDMENT THAN UNDER THE COMMERCE CLAUSE SEEMS SUF FICIENTLY WELL ESTABLISHED BY ITS LANGUAGE IN THE OPINIONS AND BY ITS REFUSAL TO REVIEW ALASKA PACKERS ASSOCIATION V HEDEN SKOYL27 THIS REFUSAL HOWEVER DOES NOT ITSELF PROVE THAT BENE FICIAL PURPOSE IS NECESSARY FOR SITUS IN THE MIND OF THE SUPREME COURT OUR FAITH ON THIS POINT IS STAKED FIRST ON THE FACT THAT THE BENEFICIAL PURPOSE HAS BEEN PRESENT IN ALL OF THE CASES IN WHICH EXEMPTION WAS DENIED AND THAT IN A NUMBER OF THEM IT HAS BEEN REFERRED TO AS IMPORTANT SECONDLY ON THE BELIEF THAT TAXING THINGS TEMPORARILY PRESENT HAS FUNDAMENTALLY THE SAME VICE OF EXTRATERRITORIALITY THAT IS FOUND IN TAKING AN EXCESSIVE AVERAGE OF AN AGGREGATE OF THINGS TEMPORARILY PRESENT WHICH THE SUPREME COURT HAS HELD OBNOXIOUS TO THE FOURTEENTH AMEND MENT128 AND FINALLY THAT IN THE DISCUSSION IN GROMER V STAND ARD DREDGING CO129 AND IN THE ATTEMPTED REINTERPRETATIONS OF BUCK V BEACH130 THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES HAVE PRETTY CLEARLY IMPLIED A RECOGNITION OF THE PRINCIPLE THAT TEMPORARY PRESENCE ALONE DOES NOT CONFER SITUS AN ADDED REASON FOR ASSUMING THIS TO BE THE SUPREME COURTS ATTITUDE IS THAT IT MAKES FOR HARMONY IN THE LAW AS A WHOLE WE HAVE SEEN THAT THE EXEMPTION OF THINGS IN TRANSIT CANNOT BE ANI MATED BY ANYTHING SACRED IN TRANSIT ITSELF SINCE TRANSIT EXEMPTS ONLY WHEN IT SHOWS THAT A TAX WOULD HAVE THE VICE OF EXTRATERRI TORIALITY THIS VICE IS NOT THOUGHT TO BE PRESENT WHEN THE PROP 27 NOTE 42 SUPRA 128 UNION TANK LINE CO V WRIGHT NOTE 8 SUPRA O NOTE 40 SUPRA 130 NOTE 41 SUPRA 527VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW ERTY HALTS FOR A BENEFICIAL PURPOSE WHILE THE OPINIONS HAVE POINTED OUT THAT TO THE BENEFICIAL PURPOSE WAS ADDED UNCERTAINTY ON TAX DAY WHETHER THE PROPERTY WOULD CERTAINLY SOON GO ON THEY HAVE ALSO CONCEDED THAT IT WAS ONLY TEMPORARILY PRESENT SO THAT UNDER THE COMMERCE CLAUSE THEY HAVE REALLY MADE BENEFICIAL PURPOSE THE TEST OF TAXABILITY SUCH A TEST IS NOT DRAWN FROM THE LANGUAGE OF THE CONSTITUTION IT MUST BE DRAWN FROM THE COURTS VIEWS OF DESIRABLE AND UNDESIRABLE RESULTS SINCE THE ISSUE IS FUNDAMENTALLY ONE OF JURISDICTION IT SEEMS NATURAL TO BELIEVE THAT THE COURT WOULD CHOOSE THE SAME TEST OF JURISDICTION IN WHATEVER FORM THE QUESTION MAY TECHNICALLY ARISE EVEN IF IT IS CONCEDED THAT TEMPORARY PRESENCE ALONE DOES NOT CONFER SITUS THERE STILL REMAINS THE DIFFICULTY OF PROVING THAT ON TAX DAY THE PRESENCE IS CERTAINLY TEMPORARY THIS PRACTICAL DIF FICULTY MAKES SOMEWHAT SCHOLASTIC THE DISCUSSION OF WHAT SHOULD BE THE LEGAL PRINCIPLE SINCE PRESENCE FOR SOME BENEFICIAL PUR POSE CONFERS SITUS HOWEVER BRIEF THE TIME REQUIRED FOR THE AC COMPLISHMENT OF THAT PURPOSE PROOF THAT THE PRESENCE IS EPHEM ERAL CAN HAVE IMPORTANCE ONLY WHEN NO BENEFICIAL PURPOSE APPEARS SELDOM CAN SUCH PROOF BE GIVEN EXCEPT WHEN THE PROP ERTY IS SUBSTANTIALLY IN THE COURSE OF INTERSTATE TRANSIT WE MAY BE CERTAIN OF THE INTENTION OF THE OWNER BUT HIS INTENTION IS NOT ENOUGH HE MAY CHANGE HIS MIND WE MAY BE CONFIDENT OF THE FUTURE FROM THE PAST COURSE OF BUSINESS BUT THIS CONFIDENCE CAN BE PROOF ONLY WHEN DEFINITE PURCHASERS IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS HAVE ALREADY BOUGHT THE SPECIFIC PROPERTY IN QUESTION WHEN THE PROPERTY IS ACTUALLY ON ITS WAY TO SUCH PURCHASERS IT WILL GET EXEMPTION AS A THING IN TRANSIT WHETHER THE DOCTRINE THAT TEMPORARY PRESENCE DOES NOT CREATE SITUS CAN EVER HAVE ANY PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE APART FROM AND IN ADDITION TO THE DOCTRINE THAT THINGS IN TRANSIT ARE EXEMPT UNDER THE COMMERCE CLAUSE WILL DEPEND LARGELY UPON WHETHER THE COURTS WILL EVER BE SATISFIED TO INFER EPHEMERALITY FROM PROOF OF WHAT IS LIKELY ON TAX DAY WITHOUT DEMANDING PROOF OF WHAT IS ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN AT THAT TIME JUDGE PROVOSTY IS DOUBTLESS RIGHT IN SAYING THAT FOR THE SOLUTION OF THIS QUESTION NO RULE HAS AS YET BEEN FORMULATED AND PERHAPS IN THE NATURE OF THINGS NONE CAN BE THE QUESTION BEING ONE MORE OF FACT THAN OF 528TAXATION OF THINGS IN TRANSIT LAW 131 THIS MEANS THAT RELIEF FROM THE TAXATION OF THINGS NOT IN TRANSIT BUT PRESENT ONLY TEMPORARILY AND FOR NO BENE FICIAL PURPOSE MUST BE OBTAINED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY IN OTHER COURTS THAN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES WITH THEIR POWER TO MAKE EXCEPTIONS TO THE LETTER OF A STATUTE THEY MAY EXEMPT A TRAVELLING CIRCUS EVEN WHEN CONCEDEDLY ITS TRANSIT IS BROKEN BE CAUSE IT HAS STOPPED FOR A PROFITABLE EXHIBITION THEY MAY BE SATISFIED THAT FURNITURE AND AUTOMOBILES ARE PRESENT ONLY TEM PORARILY 132 WHEN IF THEY WERE NOT SO SATISFIED THE SUPREME COURT COULD NOT FIND ANY EVIDENCE OR ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE ON WHICH TO OVERRULE THEM THUS THOUGH THE SUPREME COURT HAS PAID INDIRECT HOMAGE TO THE THEORY THAT PROPERTY THOUGH CON CEDEDLY NOT IN SUBSTANTIAL COURSE OF INTERSTATE TRANSIT MAY STILL BE ENTITLED TO EXEMPTION UNDER THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT BE CAUSE ITS PRESENCE IS EPHEMERAL IT HAS NOT YET PUT THE THEORY IN PRACTICE AND IS NOT LIKELY OFTEN TO DO SO THE SITUATION THUS DISCLOSED REQUIRES US TO SEEK SUCH PRACTI CAL JUSTIFICATIONS AS CAN BE FOUND FOR IMPOSING A YEARS TAX ON PROPERTY THAT IS LIKELY TO BE PRESENT ONLY FOR A WEEK SUCH A TAX IS IN ECONOMICS GUILTY OF THE VICE OF EXTRATERRITORIALITY EVEN IF THE PROPERTY TAXED IS REAPING PROFIT FROM ITS TEMPORARY STOP A STATE IS GETTING MORE THAN IT DESERVES WHEN IT COLLECTS A YEARS BOARD FOR A WEEKS HOSPITALITY IT IS FORBIDDEN TO DO THIS BY TAKING AN EXCESSIVE AVERAGE OF A SUCCESSION OF TEMPORARY PRES ENCES OF CARS CONTINUALLY FLITTING IN AND OUT WHY SHOULD IT NOT BE SIMILARLY RESTRAINED WHEN IT PUTS A YEARS TAX ON A HERD OF CATTLE THAT COMES IN TO FEED FOR TWO OR THREE MONTHS GRANT THAT THE CATTLE OUGHT TO PAY SOMETHING SHOULD THEY PAY FOR A YEAR IS THERE NOT IN SUCH A CASE AS MUCH REASON FOR THE SEVER ING JUDGMENT OF SOLOMON AS IN THE CASE OF THE PROCESSION OF CARS WHEN A STATE DOES NOT CONTENT ITSELF WITH LEVYING ITS TAX ON A FIXED DAY IN THE YEAR BUT SETS ITS TAX TRAP SO AS TO CATCH EVERY MOUSE AS IT COMES IN ITS ZEAL SEEMS ESPECIALLY WORTHY OF CON DEMNATION IT MIGHT WELL BE REQUIRED TO GRANT A REBATE WHEN 13 NOTE 60 SUPRA  SEMPLE V COMMONWEALTH NOTE 79 SUPRA 529VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW THE PROPERTY LEAVES OR AT LEAST A REBATE FOR SUCH PERIOD AS IT IS ACTUALLY TAXED ELSEWHERE133 SUCH CASES ARE HOWEVER EXCEPTIONAL THE NORMAL SITUATION IS THAT IN WHICH TAX DAY COMES BUT ONCE A YEAR PROPERTY THAT MERELY CHANCES TO BE PASSING THROUGH ON THAT DAY IS LIKELY TO ES CAPE ANY LEVY EITHER AS A THING IN TRANSIT OR BECAUSE ITS TEMPO RARY PRESENCE YIELDS IT NO SPECIAL BENEFIT IF THE PROPERTY IS HELD FOR SALE WITHIN THE STATE THERE IS GOOD REASON TO ASSUME THAT IT WILL STAY IN THE STATE AS LONG AS IT LASTS IT CERTAINLY CANNOT PROVE THAT ITS STAY IS TO BE SHORT IT SHOULD TAKE ITS CHANCE ALONG WITH ALL OTHER PROPERTY THAT MAY SOON BE CONSUMED OR WITH DRAWN TO OTHER STATES A STILL STRONGER REASON EXISTS IN FAVOR OF TAXING THE COAL AND OIL AND HARDWARE THAT BELONG TO A CON TINUOUS THOUGH CONSTANTLY CHANGING STOCK IF THE TANK IS FULL ALL THE YEAR IT SHOULD NOT MATTER THAT SPECIFIC GALLONS COME AND GO INSTEAD OF TAKING AN AVERAGE THE STATE ASSESSES WHAT IT FINDS ON TAX DAY WHICH IS WHAT IT DOES WITH THE STOCK OF EVERY LOCAL MERCHANT THE CONCERN ENGAGED IN CONTINUOUS BUSINESS HAS AS GOOD A CHANCE TO WIN AS TO LOSE BY THIS ANNUAL SAMPLING SOMEWHAT ROUGH AND READY METHODS MAY BE ALLOWED WHEN THEY ARE LIKELY IN MOST INSTANCES TO BE FAIR ENOUGH SOMETHING MAY BE SAID TOO IN FAVOR OF TAXING EVEN THE PROP ERTY THAT IS ALL THAT ITS OWNER SENDS INTO A STATE IN MOST IN STANCES IT HAS COMPLETELY BROKEN FROM ITS PREVIOUS BASE SO THAT IT NEED NOT PAY TAXES THERE IN THIS RESPECT IT DIFFERS FROM THE SHIPS AND CARS THAT TRAVEL ON ROUNDTRIP TICKETS THE ONLY REASONABLE GROUND ON WHICH TO EXEMPT PROPERTY FROM TAXATION WHERE IT IS ON TAX DAY IS THE FAIR CERTAINTY THAT IT IS TAXABLE SOMEWHERE ELSE IT SHOULD BE AWARDED A SITUS WHERE IT IS UN LESS IT IS REASONABLY CLEAR THAT IT HAS NOT LOST ITS SITUS WHERE IT WAS THE POSSIBILITY OR PRACTICAL CERTAINTY THAT IT WILL SOON AC QUIRE A SITUS AT SOME UNKNOWN PLACE WHICH IT HAS NOT YET VISITED IS NOT A STRONG GROUND ON WHICH TO CLAIM EXEMPTION VARYING TAX DAYS IN DIFFERENT STATES COMPLICATE THE PROBLEM OF FAIRNESS BUT THE COMPLICATION IS SO COMPLICATED AND SO UNCERTAIN THAT IT 33 SEE THE STATUTES INVOLVED IN THE CASES CITED IN NOTES 84 AND 124 SUPRA 530TAXATION OF THINGS IN TRANSIT SEEMS THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS TO DISREGARD IT MOST PERSONS EN GAGED IN A CONTINUOUS COURSE OF

COURSE OF BUSI NESS IN THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE PERIPATETIC CHATTELS WHICH HAVE ABANDONED FOREVER THEIR PLACE OF ORIGIN ARE BY AND LARGE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO ESCAPE TAXATION ALTOGETHER THAN TO GET TAXED

CLAUSE AS ARE THOUGHT NECESSARY IN ORDER TO PROTECT INTERSTATE COMMERCE FROM UNDUE BURDENS THIS RAISES THE QUESTION WHETHER THINGS IN TRANSIT SHOULD BE EXEMPTED EXCEPT WHEN THEIR TRANSIT DOES NOT SAVE THEM FROM TAX ATION AT THEIR HEADQUARTERS SHOULD EXEMPTION EVER BE ACCORDED EXCEPT AS THE COROLLARY OF TAXABILITY ELSEWHERE THE DOGMA THAT THE STATES CANNOT TAX INTERSTATE COMMERCE IS NOW SEEN TO BE A

THAT A TAX BURDEN ON EVERY SALE HOWEVER MADE WOULD BE A BARRIER TO THE INTRODUCTION OF ARTICLES INTO THE STATE SUBJECTION TO THE GENERAL PROPERTY TAX IS NOT CONCEIVED TO BE SUCH A BARRIER EXCEPT WHEN THE PROPERTY IS STILL IN TRANSIT AND THE TRANSIT IS GOOD EVIDENCE THAT THE PROPERTY IS NOT GOING TO RE MAIN IN THE JURISDICTION IN WHICH IT IS FOUND ON TAX DAY THIS AT LEAST IS THE LIMIT TO WHICH THE SUPREME COURT DECISIONS HAVE GONE WE MAY INFER THAT UNCOMPLETED TRANSIT IN THE JURISDIC TION IN WHICH THE TRANSIT IS CERTAIN TO TERMINATE WOULD PREVENT TAXATION BUT IT HAS NOT YET DONE SO SOME OF THE EXEMPTIONS UNDER THE COMMERCE CLAUSE DOUBTLESS GO BEYOND WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED BY A CAREFUL ECONOMIC ANALY SIS OF PRACTICAL RESULTS SOME OF THE DENIALS OF EXEMPTION BOTH UNDER THE COMMERCE CLAUSE AND UNDER DUE PROCESS OF LAW DOUBT LESS OFFEND NICE ANTIPATHIES TO EXTRATERRITORIAL TAXATION BIJU RISDICTIONAL DOUBLE TAXATION OF CHATTELS IS POSSIBLE THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN PREVENTED HAD THE SUPREME COURT TAKEN THE VIEW OF THE MINORITY IN GROMER V STANDARD DREDGING CO146 AND TREATED THE ACQUISITION OF A NEW SITUS FOR CHATTELS IN ABOUT THE SAME WAY THAT COURTS TREAT THE ACQUISITION OF A NEW DOMICIL BY INDIVIDUALS BUT SUCH A VIEW WOULD FREQUENTLY PREVENT THE STATE IN WHICH PROPERTY IS LOCATED FROM GETTING FAIR COMPENSATION FOR THE PROTECTION WHICH IT GIVES WHILE AT THE SAME TIME THE ABSENCE OF THE PROPERTY FROM THE DOMICIL OF ITS OWNER MAKES IT EASY TO AVOID THE TAXCOLLECTOR THERE THE TESTS WHICH THE SUPREME COURT HAS ADOPTED REPRESENT A FAIR COMPROMISE BE TWEEN THE DESIRE TO PREVENT DOUBLE TAXATION AND THE RELUCTANCE TO PERMIT COMPLETE ESCAPE FROM TAXATION IF WE RESTRICT OUR GAZE TO THE PARTICULAR CHATTEL THAT RESENTS BEING TAXED WE SEE THAT NOT INFREQUENTLY IT MAY BE DENIED EXEMPTION FROM A LEVY THAT IS GUILTY OF A GOODLY MEASURE OF THE VICE OF EXTRATERRI TORIALITY BUT IF THE RULES LAID DOWN ARE VIEWED IN THE LIGHT OF ALL THEIR POSSIBLE APPLICATIONS TO THE MYRIAD CIRCUMSTANCES THAT 14 NOTE 40 SUPRA 534TAXATION OF THINGS IN TRANSIT 535 MAY ARISE THEY ARE SEEN TO REPRESENT A WISE AND USUALLY SUCCESS FUL EFFORT TO STEER BETWEEN THE SCYLLA OF CUMULATIVE TAXES AND THE CHARYBDIS OF NO TAX AT ALL NOW AND THEN AN EXTRAORDI NARY CASE MAY TURN UP BUT CONSTITUTIONAL LAW LIKE OTHER MORTAL CONTRIVANCES HAS TO TAKE SOME CHANCES AND IN THE GREAT MA JORITY OF INSTANCES NO DOUBT JUSTICE WILL BE DONE 147 THOMAS REED POWELL COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 14 MR JUSTICE HOLMES IN BLINN V NELSON 1911 222 U S 1 7 32 SUP CT 1

it is widely as sumed that a State has no jurisdiction to tax things in transit or things only temporarily within its borders Our problem is to discover how far this statement is justified by the decisions of the United States Supreme Court and to find the considerations which underlie the courts attitude toward the taxation of things in transit and things whose presence is ephemeral More specifically we wish to know whether the Su preme Court has been dealingwith the issues in the light of its conception of situs so that its decisions belong to the general law of jurisdiction to tax or whether it has been thinking of situs only when it was formally interpreting the Fourteenth Amendment so that its decisions under the commerce clause are the private preserve of the student of constitutional law upon which the student of conflict of laws may enter only as a guest Is the bottom ground of exemption from taxation to be found in the fact of interstate transit or is interstate transit significant only as evidence of temporary stay Where the transit is so broken that the commerce clause does not confer exemption does it follow necessarily that the visiting chattel has acquired a situs with its temporary host or may it still rely on the Fourteenth Amendment for protection against paying for a year when it is present only for a week 1 For the preceding instalments

itself a ground of exemption Property has never been immune from taxation because employed in interstate com merce Such employment often occurs without any absence from home Ties and tracks and stations and bridges are agen cies of interstate commerce which remain always in the same place Cars and engines may be used constantly in interstate commerce and yet never depart from the jurisdiction in which they originate All such property permanently within a single jurisdiction is taxable to the same extent as property wholly without the fold of the commerce clause2 Neither use in in terstate commerce nor motion in interstate commerce is in it self a shield against taxation Wherever peripatetic property has found such a shield it has always been present only tempo rarily in the jurisdiction against which the shield has been a barrier Ships have escaped from taxation at the ports at which they merely stopped temporarily in the course of their inter state transit3 Logs 4 and sheep5 have escaped while on their way through an intermediate jurisdiction between their place of origin and their destination In all these cases there has been both interstate transit and lack of permanent presence The former indeed involves the latter A case might be imagined in which property in continuous interstate transit might be within a single jurisdiction for an entire tax period and thus satisfy the requirement of permanent presence as the term is used in the law of jurisdiction to tax The classic classroom 2 See Mr Justice Field in Gloucester Ferry Co v Pennsylvania 1885 114 U S

sea No such case however has appeared outside of the classroom so that all the instances in which interstate transit has foiled the taxgatherer have been instances in which the transit was a sure sign that the property was soon to leave The exemptions that have been granted thus afford no basis for believing that prop erty enjoys any immunity from taxation merely because it is in the course of interstate transit When we turn to the cases in which exemption has been de nied we find proof positive that interstate transit alone does not confer immunity In the leading case which exempted ships from taxation at a port which they touched for a brief stop it was declared that they were there but temporarily engaged in lawful trade and commerce with their situs at their home port where the vessels belonged and where their owners were liable to be taxed for the capital invested and where the taxes had been paid 6 There was no doubt that property in continuous interstate transit might be taxed at the domicil of its owner if it acquired no actual situs elsewhere and even this qualification was added only over the dissent of two members of the court7 The qualification itself posits taxability of property in inter state transit away from the domicil of its owner provided it can satisfy the requisite of situs This requisite is satisfied when the taxing jurisdiction confines itself to a fair average of the property visiting it so that the values assessed are not more than what reasonably may be claimed to have received a years protection8 If situs is acquired by an average

interstate transit is immaterial Thus it appears that interstate transit fails to exempt where in any way the requirement of situs is complied with It seems therefore that property is exempted not because it is in interstate transit but because its transit shows that its stay is ephemeral The transit makes it certain that a tax is guilty of a temporal form of the vice of extraterritoriality Looked at from the stand point of a year and not of a day only the assessor is coveting his neighbors goods A possible qualification of this analysis is to be noted If we may rely on obiter dictum it seems that the jurisdiction in which the owner is domiciled may lose its hold on logs and oil and grain when it does not lose its hold on cars and ships In terstate transit appears to exempt the object carried when it does not exempt the object carrying it The case 12 in which this was declared was one in which grain visited temporarily the jurisdiction where its owner was domiciled Mr Justice Hughes insisted that if the grain were in the course of interstate transit it would be exempt from taxation He declared that the same would be true of logs still at the domicil of their owner where they had always been provided they were already started on an interstate journey As to the grain this dictum in no way mili tates against our analysis that interstate transit exempts only when it shows that the stay of the property is temporary The same is true with respect to the logs if we may assume that the tax is for the period following the date of levy rather than for the period preceding3 Under this assumption the property is only temporarily present when it has just begun an interstate  In Bacon v Illinois 1913 227 U S 504 511512 33 Sup Ct 299 7 VA LAW REV 180182 437440 12 Note 11 supra 1 That this assumption is warranted seems evident from the fact that in all the cases the inquiry made by the courts relates to the future situ ation of the property rather than to the past I have found no case in which a claim to exemption was predicated on the fact that the prop erty was of recent origin or had but recently come into the jurisdiction nor any case in which property

of an inter state journey If the property is in the State of its origin it has certainly acquired no situs elsewhere If it has left the State of its origin it is likely to have lost its former situs there If all the States have the same tax day the departing or visiting prop erty will escape taxation for a year if it is not taxed at the dom icil of its owner Such a principle might make it worth John Wanamakers while to stop selling goods on tax day and to start his New York stock on a journey to Philadelphia and his Phila delphia stock on a journey to New York There seems no good reason for a rule that would permit any tangible property to escape taxation for a year Disrelish for such a result has moved the Supreme Court to allow ships to be taxed at the domicil of their owner though they may never visit that domi cil14 It is not easy to square this dicttum in Bacon v Illinois 15 with the policy underlying the actual decisions of the court In the presence of an apparent dilemma created by a situation in which the State does not deserve the tax but the owner does not deserve exemption from it the court has commonly preferred to favor the State rather than the owner The objection to this dictum in Bacon v Illinois 16 depends for its strength upon the assumption that all the States have the same tax day In the cases involving the New York Central 17 and the Southern Pacific18 it was thought that the cars and the ships would escape entirely if they were not taxed at the domicil of their owner They were not in the course of a single move from one place of rest to another as were the grain and the oil and the logs These commodities might possibly be taxed in another jurisdiction the following month as soon as they came to rest and were sold or offered for sale

property may have to pay two taxes because it migrates from one State to another may be one to avoid because of the burden on interstate commerce even though the avoidance carries the risk that the property may pay no tax at all The nice decision of such an issue would vary according to the laws of the various States But if the dictum of Bacon v Illinois 20 should become established by decision the eventuation would not shake the principle that interstate transit exempts from taxation only when it is sure proof that the property is only temporarily present It would require no modification of any conclusion as to the re lation between the commerce clause and the conception of situs when power to tax is necessarily predicated on presence of the property on tax day It would indicate merely a new instance in which power to tax based on power over the owner must yield to other considerations This would in substance add to exemption on the ground of an actual situs elsewhere exemption because of the certainty of soon acquiring such an actual situs elsewhere and the possibility that the newlyacquired situs would result in immediate taxation It would not shake our belief that exemptions of things in transit under the commerce clause de pend upon and are limited by considerations of extraterritorial ity even though it might afford an instance in which the com merce clause exempts things in transit that are encumbered with a technical situs sufficient to satisfy the Fourteenth Amendment This brings us to the problem presented by the cases in which exemptions claimed under the commerce clause were denied on the ground that interstate transit had not begun or had ended or had been interrupted in an intermediate jurisdiction for some independent purpose21 Do these cases represent the Supreme Courts conception of situs or are they independent thereof Does the absence of interstate transit go merely to the interpre tation of the commerce clause or is it also significant as negativ mined in plaintiffs mine in Allegheny County Pennsylvania that a tax of two or more mills was paid on it in Pennsylvania as State tax thereon in the year 1880 being the tax of 1880 that a tax was also paid on it to the County of Allegheny for the year 1880    114 U S 622 625 626 20 Note 11 supra 2 See 7 VA LAW REv 180191 502TAXATION OF THINGS IN TRANSIT ing any certainty that the property is going to move on and therefore as affording a test for determining whether chattels are in a position to adduce a dueprocess claim to exemption on the ground that they are only temporarily present The cases are not without evidence in support of this second hypothesis In Coe v Errol22 where logs were held taxable in the State of their origin though piled on the bank of a river to be floated to another State Mr Justice Bradley observed that although intended for exportation they may never be ex ported since the owner has a perfect right to change his mind23 The absence of interstate transit then made it un certain whether the logs would later leave This indicates that the tax was regarded as one for the period following the date of levy and that on the facts as of that date the court was not convinced that the presence of the property was ephemeral In Diamond Match Co v Ontonagon24 in which also logs were held taxable in the State of their origin it appeared that in 1894 and 1895 about 180000000 feet had been cut and put into the river All of the logs taxed for the year 1899 had been within the taxing jurisdiction for more than a year We are not told the quantity taxed but it is stated that of the quantity origi nally put in the river there were shipped by rail to another State fortytwo million feet in 1897 thirtyseven million feet in 1898 and fourteen million feet in 1899 up to the time when the logs were seized for nonpayment of taxes It is stipulated that the logs were to remain where they were taxed until they could be sawed at designated mills in another State Obviously there was here no certain evidence as to when the property would fi nally leave Mr Justice McKenna quotes Mr Justice Brad leys rhetorical question whether the owners intent to export and his partial preparation can exempt from taxation25 and he concludes by saying that the contention before him is more ex  1886 116 U S 517 6 Sup Ct 575 7 VA LAW REV

than that made and rejected in Coe v Errol26 The case is obviously one in which the absence of actual transit renders it speculative and uncertain when or whether the preexisting situs would be lost by removal to another jurisdiction The same speculation and uncertainty appears in the cases in which chattels were subjected to a property tax in a State to which they had recently come In Bacon v Illinois 27 Mr Jus tice Hughes observed that the property was held in Chicago by the plaintiff for his own purposes with full power of disposition and that he might sell it in Illinois or forward it as he saw fit In Brown v Houston 28 Mr Justice Bradley called the coal in question a commodity in the market of New Orleans which might continue in that condition for a year or two years or only for a day29 This is quoted by Mr Justice Field in Pitts burg  Southern Coal Co v Bates30 in which the facts were substantially like those in Brown v Houston31 In Susque hanna Coal Co v South Amboy 32 Mr Justice McKenna noted that there was valuable property kept in the State represented by the coal varying in quantity from 10000 tons to 150000 tons and that this coal was used to fill anticipated ordersorders not immediately made but it may be certain to be made 33 In American Steel  Wire Co v Speed 34 the goods in Memphis were there held in store at the risk of the steel company to be sold and delivered as contracts for that purpose were completely consummated 35 In these last two cases the previous general course of business made it pretty certain that most or all of the property present on tax day would soon be leaving for another jurisdiction But the time of that leaving was uncertain Con tingencies might arise to defeat the anticipations of orders from 6 188 U S 82 97 28

goods would later be brought in to take their place The complainants were wholesale merchants who sold where they could The taxes complained of in the Steel  Wire Case were a merchants tax based upon the average capital invested in the business and a merchants privilege tax assessed in some differ ent way not revealed by the opinion of the court The stock of goods on hand fluctuated from an amount worth 30000 to an amount worth 100000 Obviously the assessment of an ex cise by taking an average would cure all legitimate complaints as does the application of a fair average devised by the unit rule The opinion of the court does not advert to this but treats both taxes as it would treat an ad zalorcnz property tax A similar attitude was taken towards the peculiar tax sustained in Gen eral Oil Co v Crain36 This was an inspection fee on oil The charge was twentyfive cents a barrel The oil was taken from the original packages and put in tanks for an independent pur pose which was held to break the transit and thus to deprive the commodity of its interstate character The fees were sustained as an exercise of fiscal power without inquiring whether they might be good as recompense for police supervision even if not good as a tax37 Two judges dissented with respect to one tank of oil that before arrival in Tennessee had been sold to purchas ers in other States They thought such oil still substantially in transit for the reason that they regarded its temporary removal to the tanks as merely as aid to the most economical mode of transit Yet obviously this oil differed from the rest which the minority conceded to be subject to the tax only in the respect 3S 1908 209 U S 211 28 Sup Ct 475 7 VA LAW REV 185186 37 At page 231 Mr Justice McKenna says We have considered this case so far in view of the cases which involve the power of taxation It may be that such power is more limited than the power to enact in spection laws Patapsco Guano Co v Board of Agriculture 171 U S 356 The difference if any exists it is not necessary to observe The cases based on the taxing power show the contentions of plaintiff in er ror are without merit in other words show that its oil was not prop erty in interstate commerce 505VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW that it was already sold to customers in other States while the rest was not This oil having been already sold was certain soon to go on the rest was not The minority then find no break in transit where the property is certain to be present only temporarily The majority differ They hold that if the pur pose of the temporary presence is to gain some advantage not incidental to the transit itself the transit is broken and the com merce clause does not protect Notwithstanding this rejection of the minority position the General Oil Case on its facts does not cut into the conclusion that where migratory property has unsuccessfully claimed exemption from taxation as a thing in transit it has been unable to prove that on tax day it was certain that its presence was to be only temporary For the tax before the court was not a property tax It was not an ad valorem tax for a year but was an ex cise for having a certain kind of property on hand like an ex cise on sales 38 or on manufacture39 The actual decision there fore does not break the unanimity with which Supreme Court cases testify to a correspondence between the commerceclause exemption of things in interstate transit and a conception that temporary presence in a jurisdiction other than that of the dom 38 People ex rel Hatch v Reardon 1907 204 U S 152 27 Sup Ct 188 At pages 158159 Mr Justice Holmes says It is urged further that a tax on sales is really a tax on property and that therefore the act as applied to the shares of a foreign corpora tion owned by nonresidents is a taking of property without due precess of law Union Refrigerator Transit Co v Kentucky 199 U S 194 This argument presses the expressions in Brown v Maryland 12 Wheat 419 444 Fairbank v United States 181 U S 283 and intervening cases to new applications and farther than they properly can be made to go Whether we are to distinguish or to identify taxes on sales and taxes on goods depends on the scope of the constitutional provision con cerned   Whatever the right of parties engaged in commerce among the States a sale depends in part on the law of the State where it takes place for its validity and in the courts of that State at least for the mode of proof No one would contest the power to enact a statute of frauds for such transactions Therefore the State may make the parties pay for the help of its laws as against this objection 3 American Manufacturing Co v St Louis 1919 250 U S 459 39 Sup Ct 522 The head note in 63 L Ed 1084 is as follows A tax is not imposed upon the property or the business transactions of a foreign corporation outside the State so as to take the property of the corporation without due process of law by a municipal license tax upon the conduct by such corporation of a manufacturing business in the city measured by the amount of the sales of the goods manufactured in the local factory whether sold within or without the State either in domestic or interstate commerce 506TAXATION OF THINGS IN TRANSIT icil of the owner does not create the situts requisite to levy a tax for a year In every case in which the commerce clause has ex empted because of transit it was certain that the property was soon to abscond In every case in which the commerce clause has withheld exemption from a general property tax because the transit was thought to be broken there was no certain assurance on tax day that the property would soon depart This analysis however takes too narrow and legalistic a view for our present purpose Our interest is not confined to what the Supreme Court has actually done We wish to know what it is likely to do in the various contingencies that may arise in the future From the standpoint of prophecy what the Supreme Court chooses to think that it is doing is often more important than what it actually does And in the General Oil Case it chose to proceed as though it were passing on a general property tax The cases cited in support of its decisions are cases sustaining a general property tax The opinion there fore indicates the belief of the Supreme Court that the com merce clause permits the taxation of property only temporarily present in a jurisdiction between its places of origin and of des tination provided the presence is for the purpose of enjoying some local facility not merely contributory to interstate transit Since the oil in question was already sold to purchasers beyond Tennessee its delay in Tennessee even if for an independent business purpose as the majority insist was still certain to be a delay of brief duration So the majority in drawing the line be tween transit and break in transit do not make it run between certainty and uncertainty whether the property is soon to go on They are guided by the purpose of a halt in transit and not by its duration This however does not establish that the question of transit under the commerce clause differs from the question of situs un der due process of law The Supreme Court may still be inter preting the commerce clause in the light of its conception of situs This conception may be that situs may be acquired by any presence from which the property derives some special ad vantage Under this assumption temporary presence while it does not of itself confer situs and corresponding jurisdiction to 507VIRGINIA LAWt REVIEW tax for a year nevertheless does not prevent the acquisition of situs if to temporary presence is added some special advantage therefrom Thus by diversifying somewhat the concept of situs we may still believe that the Supreme Courts applications of the doctrine that things in interstate transit are exempted by the commerce clause correspond exactly with its views as to the dictates of the Fourteenth Amendment as to jurisdiction to tax things only temporarily present A difference may perhaps have to be recognized with respect to property at the domicil of its owner but so far at least as situs is dependent upon power over the property rather than over its owner we are entitled to assume that the cases on things in transit represent the Supreme Courts conception of situs unless and until we find the court holding that due process of law forbids the taxation of things enjoying special advantages from temporary presence No such application of the dueprocess clause has thus far been made by the Supreme Court We have no certain justifi cation for assuming that chattels which failed to secure exemp tion under the commerce clause would have fared better had they adduced the Fourteenth Amendment No safe inference can be drawn from the dueprocess cases already reviewed The minority in Gromer v Standard Dredging Co40 voted for ex emption because of the absence of proof that the property had lost its situs at the domicil of its owner The majority put the burden on the owner rather than on the taxing authority and thought that the owner had neither met that burden nor prop erly raised the issue While this does not conclusively shatter a fond hope that something other than transit may prove that the presence of property is not such as to give it a situs the fact that the majority were unquestionably questionably technical in refusing to consider the doctrine of the minority inclines one to infer a disapproval of that doctrine True the majority opin ion neither negatives nor affirms the idea that there might be sure proof of speedy departure which would be sufficient to overcome the inference to be drawn from the profitable use of property within the jurisdiction Moreover the disposition of 40 1912 224 U S 362 32 Sup Ct 499 7 VA LAW REV 442451 508TAXATION OF THINGS IN TRANSIT some of the justices to give an autopsic diagnosis of Buck v Beach 41 as a case of exemption on account of temporary pres ence lends some backhanded support to a hope that things not in transit might still prove that their presence was ephemeral and so get exemption under the dueprocess clause Such a hope however could not extend to the property involved in the Standard Dredging Case where to presence was added profita ble employment Thus we may still have faith in the hypothe sis that temporary presence plus profitable use confers juris diction to tax as against any complaint of the lack of the situs required by due process of law To faith seems to be added something pretty close to sight by the recent refusal of the Supreme Court to grant a petition for a writ of certiorari to the United States circuit court of appeals for the ninth circuit in the case of Alaska Packers Association v Hedenskoy42 This allowed Alaska to collect a poll tax for school purposes from the members of a salmonfishing crew who concededly had their permanent residence elsewhere and were in Alaska only temporarily The employer paid the tax and one of the crew brought a libel to get his full wages without deduc tion for the tax In the opinion of the circuit court of appeals Judge Hunt stated that it was immaterial that the season for ac tual salmonfishing was only about thirtyfive days He notes that the period of employment extended over some five months of which three months were spent in Alaska He points out that libelant was not a mere sojourner bound through Alaska for another place43 but that he agreed to perform work with in the territory during the fishing season44 An earlier district court case in which Chinese laborers engaged in railroad con struction were held not subject to perform labor on the high ways 45 was distinguished on the ground that the statute there 41 1907 206 U S 392 27 Sup Ct 712 7 VA LAW REV 451453 C C A Ninth Circuit 1920 267 Fed 154 Petition for certiorari denied in Hedenskoy v Alaska Packers Association United States

Judge Deady observed at page 345 It is not 509VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW applied only to residents The Alaska Act included all male per sons within the territory of Alaska or the waters thereof with certain exceptions not here material That it was designed to catch persons only temporarily present is evident from its re quirement that those who arrived in the territory after a certain date should pay the tax within thirty days after such arrival or within ten days after demand by the collector The Alaska tax may be likened to the excise on the use of motor vehicles sustained in Kane v New Jersey46 in which it was held no discrimination against nonresidents to tax them in the same way as residents notwithstanding the probability that their use of the New Jersey roads would be much less than that of residents An excise of this character like the inspection tax sustained in General Oil Co v Crain47 is doubtless immune from restrictions that may be thought appropriate for a general property tax so that the case on its facts goes no further than the General Oil Case except to indicate that a dueprocess com plaint adds nothing to one founded on the commerce clause This indication is not explicit as Judge Hunt does not mention dueprocess It is however elementary that fishing is not com merce48 so that it seems safe to assume that here we have a case like Gromer v Standard Dredging Co49 in which the defence to the tax was not interstate transit but temporary presence in dependent of transit What makes the case important is the fact that the opinion of the circuit court of appeals treats the prob lem as identical with that presented by property taxes and de clares that it is well established that taxation of personal prop erty which may be temporarily within a State but used therein for profit is lawful although the owner has his domicil in an other State 50 Earlier after reviewing some State cases it denied that the legislature may provide that every person who is found in a particular road district on a certain day in the year shall be liable to do road work therein for that year 46 1916 242 U S 160 37 Sup Ct 30 t7 Note 36 supra McCready v Virginia 1877 94 U S 391

doctrine is that if the main pur pose of the presence of the personal property is to devote it to a use within the State to which it has been removed then it has a taxable situs within the State 51 Of course the refusal of the Supreme Court to grant the pe tition for a writ of certiorari is not proof positive that it ap proves of all of the opinion of the court below The case arose in the district court for the northern district of California and was evidently brought under the admiralty jurisdiction to recover for an alleged breach of a maritime contract Since the libelant chose to go from the district court to the circuit court of appeals he put his neck into the noose that the jurisdiction of that court is fi nal in admiralty cases52 He could not go from there to the Su preme Court as of right even if at the beginning he had raised a constitutional issue on which he might have gone from the dis trict court directly to the Supreme Court53 Mr Hedenskoy 51 Ibid 156 52 Section 128 of the Judicial Code provides that except as provided in sections 239 and 240 the judgments and decrees of the circuit courts of appeals shall be final in all cases in which the jurisdiction is de pendent entirely upon the opposite parties to the suit or controversy being aliens and citizens of the United States or citizens of different States also in all cases arising under the patent laws under the copyright laws under the revenue laws and under the criminal laws and in admiralty cases Sections 230 and 240 are the ones permitting the circuit courts of appeals to certify questions of law to the Supreme Court and per mitting the Supreme Court to issue writs of certiorari to the circuit courts of appeal These ways to the Supreme Court are not ways to which a litigant is entitled as of right The only case I have found in which an appeal was attempted from the circuit court of appeals to the Supreme Court in an admiralty case is Oregon R  N R Co v Balfour 1900 179 U S 55 21 Sup Ct 28 in

quoted in note 52 supra though I have been unable to find a case on the point The section makes the judgment of the circuit court of appeals final in all admiralty cases thus drawing a distinction between admiralty cases and cases arising on diversity of citizenship Judgments of the circuit courts of appeals in the latter class of cases are final only when jurisdiction is dependent exclusively upon diversity of citizenship If it is based both on diversity of citizenship and the presence of a federal question the judgment of the circuit court of appeals is not final Henningsen v United States Fidelity 511VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW would have shown more consideration for our involvement in the present inquiry had he squarely raised the constitutional is sue at the beginping and then taken an appeal directly to the Su preme Court after his first defeat54 As the situation stands the Supreme Court may have denied certiorari because it thought the particular dispute not important enough to be bothered with That august body may be less interested in our inquiry than we at present are required to be Here was a beautiful chance to settle explicitly whether employment for profit confers situs and jurisdiction to tax even when it is certain that the employment is for a brief period and to tell us whether the litigants who have lost out under the commerce clause would have been left equally disconsolate had they relied on the Fourteenth Amend ment as well Though this opportunity for an explicit settle ment was not availed of the Supreme Court by turning a deaf ear entitles us pretty confidently to take the law as laid down by the lower court and by the authorities on which that court re lies A refusal to listen to a complaint ought to be as significant as a refusal to hold it well founded after a hearing We turn  Guaranty Co 1908 208 U S 404 28 Sup Ct 389 But the mere fact that a federal question may have arisen at the trial in the district court so that appeal or writ of error might have been taken direct to the Supreme Court from the district court does not prevent the judg ment of the circuit court of appeals from being final where resort is had to that court rather than to the Supreme Court Bagley v General Fire Extinguisher Co 1909 212 U S 477 29 Sup Ct 341 This would appear to be the rule for admiralty cases even when federal jurisdiction first obtains on other grounds as well  Instances of such direct appeal to the Supreme Court in admiralty cases in which the jurisdiction of the district court was in issue appear in The Jefferson 1909 215 U S 130 30 Sup Ct 54 and The Ira M Hedges 1910 218 U S 264 31 Sup Ct 17 I have not come upon a case in which such a direct appeal was taken in an admiralty case in which there was also a federal question but Section 238 of the Judicial Code seems to put cases involving federal questions in the same box with cases involving the jurisdiction of the district courts Mr Hughes in section 198 of his work on Federal Procedure remarks that if an admiralty case should be taken to the Supreme Courtas for instance where it involved a constitutional and jurisdictional questionor went up by certiorari    thus assuming that admiralty cases in which jurisdiction also obtains because of a constitutional question can go straight from the district court to the Supreme Court 512TAXATION OF THINGS IN TRANSIT therefore to cases in other courts which lay down the rule that situs is acquired by temporary presence when the property is in a jurisdiction for use and profit Three of these cases are cited by Judge Hunt in answer to Mr Hedenskoy In two of them it is not certain that a consti tutional issue was duly raised though plainly enough the issue was there A study of many State cases on things in transit and things temporarily present tempts one to suggest that State judges be sent to school in order to learn the wisdom of stating explicitly in their opinions the precise grounds on which relief is invoked so that we may know whether they are deciding questions of due process of law or are interpreting the com merce clause or are contenting themselves with statutory con struction One of the cases which primarily provoked this petu lance is Eoff v KennefickHammond Co55 Here was property within the State on tax day in use in railroad construction Judge Battle remarked that it did not appear how long before and after tax day were its coming and its going and that there was no evidence as to the time required to complete the road bed He declared that the property was not in transit but was here chiefly if not solely for use and profit and was subject to taxation 5 In Fennell z Pauley57 cattle brought into the State by a nonresident in December 1895 and taken out again in April 1896 were held taxable on January 1 1896 Judge Waterman declared We understand that property in transit through a State can not be taxed here nor can such as belongs to a nonresident which is here only as an incident of its transfer elsewhere To give the right to assess the personal property of a non resident found within this State it must be located here with something like permanency or for some purpose other than merely aiding its transit    These cat tle were here to be fed in order to increase their weight and value for the market In principle it was the same as the investment of money in this State and we cannot see why they should not be taxed here 58 5 1906 80 Ark 138 96 S W 986  Ibid 144 57 1900 112 Iowa 94 128 N W 153 58 Ibid 9596 513VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW The particle or in the statement something like permanency or for some purpose other than merely aiding its transit indi cates that nothing like permanency is required if the presence is not in aid of transit and is for some advantageous purpose The business use of property even though temporary seems to make it taxable Griggsby Construction Co v Freeman 59 was another case of tools and machinery used for railroad construction The prop erty had been assessed in Texas in January 1901 and was re quired to pay a tax in Louisiana on June 24th of the same year Here it seems clear that the issue of situs was so raised as to make the decision an interpretation of the requirements of due process of law Readers will sympathize with Judge Provostys perplexity when he tells us If the contention is that this property having been brought here but recently and being here but temporarily has not such a situs here as will justify its taxationand we as sume that this is the main reliance of the learned counsel for the plaintiffa question is raised on which we find the law to be in a state of considerable uncertainty Property in transitul may not be taxed and property having a situs may but at what point does property pass from the stage of transit to that of such permanency as will justify taxa tion By what characteristics is a state of transit to be distinguished from a state of permanency For the solu tion of this question no rule has as yet been formulated and perhaps in the nature of things none can be the ques tion being one more of fact than of law and the adjudica tions do not furnish much assistance 60 If we cannot have a rule we can still have a number of helpful tests and the learned judge then goes on to give one which he thinks has the approval of the Supreme Court On the other hand the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Brown v Houston supra cit and this court in the same case 33 Ann 843 seem to have regarded the fact that the property had been brought into the State for use as being the determinative test  1902 108 La 435 32 So 399 6 Ibid 440441 514TAXATION OF THINGS IN TRANSIT In the instant case the property was not in course of trans portation but was here for use and for a use likely to be of some duration possibly a full year and for the time be ing was incorporated in the bulk of the property of the State It was indistinguishable from the rest of the prop erty in no respect except in the intention of the owner to re move it at some future time more or less distant Under these circumstances its situs approached nearer to perma nency than did that of the sheep in the Wyoming case or that of the coal in the Brown v Houston case 61 While here is the intimation of absence of satisfactory proof that the presence of the property was temporary there is also the clear indication that property acquires a situs in a State by being used therein More important still is the understanding of Judge Provosty that the Supreme Courts decision in Brown v Houston 62 that the coal had ceased its transit and thus lost its exemption under the commerce clause necessarily means that it had acquired a situs which would satisfy the Fourteenth Amendment Or as Judge Hunt interprets the decision the doctrine recognized is that if the main purpose of the presence of the personal property is to devote it to a use within the State to which it has been removed then it has a taxable situs within the State 63 We reach then the conclusion that where the Supreme Court has held transit broken sufficiently to deprive property of the protection of the commerce clause it has been of the opinion that situs was acquired so that the tax would not offend the Fourteenth Amendment Though the opinions have pointed out that on tax day it could not be certain that the property was to leave the State the judges have known well enough that in fact they were permitting the States to tax property only tem porarily present This comes out plainly in Mr Justice Mc Kennas opinion in Susquehanna Coal Co v South Amboy64 L6 Ibid 441442 The Wyoming Case referred to is inconsistent with the Supreme Court case of Kelley v Rhoades note 5 supra but this was because the transit was not broken 62 Note 19 supra 63 Note 51 supra See also the cases cited in notes 121 122 124 and 126 infra  Note 32 supra 515VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW where with reference to General Oil Co v Crain 65 and Bacon v Illinois66 he says The products in neither of these cases were destined for sale in the States where stored the delay there was to be temporarya postponement of their transportation to their destinations There was however a business pur pose and advantage in the delay which was availed of and while it was availed of the products secured the protection of the State In both cases it was held that there was a cessation of interstate commerce and subjection to the do minion of the State 67 Subjection to the dominion of the State certainly means more than without the protection of the commerce clause It can mean only that the property had acquired a situs in the State Thus the Supreme Courts refusals to exempt things held not to be in transit show its conception of situs and the cases may be taken as interpretations of dueprocess of law and precedents for the student of conflict of laws as well as for the student of constitutional law According to the Supreme Court temporary presence for beneficial purposes is enough for juris diction to tax Such a principle still leaves difficulties of appli cation To Judge Provostys recognition of this68 may be added Mr Justice McKennas comment on the cases reviewed in the Susquehanna Case 69 that we are not unmindful of their principle and reasoning and the difficulty presented in them and presented here

find a purpose sufficiently beneficial to break transit but not suf ficiently extensive to confersitus where there is no doubt that the stop is to be a brief one The decisions already rendered as to things in transit may show the Supreme Courts general conception of situs and afford instances of its application of that conception and yet still leave open the possibility of other applications which would exempt property under the Fourteenth Amendment though concededly its transit was sufficiently bro ken to deprive it of any protection from the commerce clause The reinterpretations of Buck z Beach 71 are not inconsistent with any of the denials of exemption under the commerce clause This decision if placed on the ground of temporary presence merely affords an instance of property without the protection of the commerce clause but within the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment because its temporary presence was for deposit merely and not for any use that would satisfy the requirement of beneficial purpose Among the cases reviewed by Professor Beale from the stand point of the student of conflict of laws 72 are several which il lustrate the possibility that the Fourteenth Amendment may ex empt where the commerce clause is not applicable One is like the reincarnation of Buck z Beach 73 in holding notes and bonds left temporarily at the owners abandoned

it is not necessary to express an opinion whether choses in action may be taxed in a State other than the domicil and referring to certain cases Judge Perking continues Those cases all hold that such

extracted from the Supreme Court They however like the others profess to adopt the same test as to whether transit had practically begun Turning to cases involving property which has left its orig

second case contains an elaborate opinion by Judge Dill which seems to hint that if the coal were being transported in interstate commerce solely for the owner without any purchaser in existence it might not be exempt as a thing in transit un der the commerce clause He cites the Steel  Wire Case in support of the statement While interstate commerce necessarily involves interstate transpor tation the converse is not always true  A manufacturer who sends his goods manufactured in Connecticut to his own entrepot or store in New York City transports the product from one State to an other but the transportation by such owner is not of itself so far as the owner is concerned interstate commerce in the sense that the City of New York has no power to tax the goods thus stored and awaiting sale in New York although the merchandise may be intended for a foreign market The transportation lacks the essential element of trade namely sale or exchange The distinction here suggested does not find

Massachusetts where they customarily though not uniformly docked to discharge their cargoes and to be refitted6 In this latter case Chief Justice Rugg made the questionable statement that an absolute sovereign such as the United States may levy a tax upon property of its citizens not kept upon its terri tory117 For this he cited United States v Bennett18 which sustained a federal excise on the use of a foreign built yacht by an American citizen even though such use was entirely outside the territorial waters of the United States This was an excise tax and not a property tax and the tie of citizenship may well justify excises on the use of selected kinds of property not so situated as to be subject to an ad valorenm property tax The question is rather a moot one since the United States cannot levy property taxes without apportioning them among the States according to population which it is not likely to bother to do Moreover vessels that wander so as to acquire no fixed location still keep their situs at the domicil of their owner119 Chief Justice Rugg may be right in his idea that the United States is immune from the ordinary restrictions against extra territorial taxation

in on bills of lading which made a rate for their shipment after the Texas feeding was over but did not oblige the owner to ship but Judge Stephens explicitly de clares that the cattle acquire a situs in Texas123 The other de cision is merely an interpretation of the Oklahoma Transient Property Act which holds that the exemptions accorded on proof that cattle had been taxed for the same year in another jurisdiction are limited to owners who become settled in Okla homa124 The statute provides that whenever any live stock shall be located in this territory for the purpose of grazing it shall be deemed to have acquired an actual situs therein as con templated by this Act 125 The court seems to assume that the 0 Note 42 supra See 34 HARV LAW REV 542 for a note on the Hedenskoy Case

pages 23 he says We are not inclined to hold that cattle in Texas while being fat tenned in the owners pens for the outside markets are too transient to have a situs and be taxable here Indeed feeding cattle for such markets has become as grazing cattle has long been a permanent as well as extensive and profitable pursuit of the Texas people It is a local industry and during the feeding season the cattle from whatever source they may come become an important part of the mass of per sonal property of the State enjoying alike the protection of our laws and subject to the common burden of taxation

stock that comes in for grazing without confining itself to the stock in the State on a fixed day in the year An other recent decision which assumes the constitutionality of all such Migratory Stock Laws so far as the question of situs is concerned is one holding the Montana law void for noncom pliance with the uniformity provision of the Montana Constitu tion126 Had all other property brought into the State for some temporary benefit been included the tax imposed on live stock as soon as it came in to graze would have been sustained Thus we see a general consensus that property may acquire a situs by temporary presence plus the requisite benefits from such presence In all the Supreme Court decisions in which the commerce clause was held not to exempt things alleged to be in transit because the transit was held to be interrupted the inter ruption was for some beneficial purpose We may pretty confi dently take these decisions to represent the Supreme Courts conviction that this beneficial use of local facilities conferred upon the property the situs required by the Fourteenth Amend ment Thus the cases are food for the student of conflict of laws as well as for the student of constitutional law For the latter they are practically though not technically precedents for the interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment as well as of the commerce clause Since the applications of the Fourteenth Amendment to issues of situs depend upon the Supreme Courts idea of the proper principles of conflict of laws such applica tions are sauce for the student of that subject It is to be noted however that only when the Supreme Court holds that the Fed eral Constitution requires exemption are State courts bound to follow it State courts in interpreting statutes or in construing provisions in State Constitutons may negative the acquisition of situs where the Supreme Court would affirm it They may re quire something more for a beneficial purpose than the Su preme Court would require They may hold the visiting circus Hayes v Smith 1920 Mont 192 Pac 615 The court dis tinguishes Nelson Lumber Co v Loraine note 88 supra on the ground that local conditions there justified the difference of treatment 526TAXATION OF THINGS IN TRANSIT or the visiting automobile and furniture exempt where the Su preme Court would not Indeed we know only by faith that the Supreme Court re quires even a beneficial purpose in order to tax visitors who have only the Fourteenth Amendment as a possible shield So far as its actual decisions go the Supreme Court is still free to hold that temporary presence is all that is necessary to give situs Our conclusion that in all the cases in which the Supreme Court has held interstate transit ended or interrupted it has has been convinced that the property had acquired a situs and that there fore such property would have fared no better under the Four teenth Amendment than under the commerce clause seems suf ficiently well established by its language in the opinions and by its refusal to review Alaska Packers Association v Heden skoyl27 This refusal however does not itself prove that bene ficial purpose is necessary for situs in the mind of the Supreme Court Our faith on this point is staked first on the fact that the beneficial purpose has been present in all of the cases in which exemption was denied and that in a number of them it has been referred to as important secondly on the belief that taxing things temporarily present has fundamentally the same vice of extraterritoriality that is found in taking an excessive average of an aggregate of things temporarily present which the Supreme Court has held obnoxious to the Fourteenth Amend ment128 and finally that in the discussion in Gromer v Stand ard Dredging Co129 and in the attempted reinterpretations of Buck v Beach130 the Supreme Court justices have pretty clearly implied a recognition of the principle that temporary presence alone does not confer situs An added reason for assuming this to be the Supreme Courts attitude is that it makes for harmony in the law as a whole We have seen that the exemption of things in transit cannot be ani mated by anything sacred in transit itself since transit exempts only when it shows that a tax would have the vice of extraterri toriality This vice is not thought to be present when the prop 27 Note 42 supra 128 Union Tank Line Co v Wright note 8 supra o Note 40 supra 130 Note 41 supra 527VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW erty halts for a beneficial purpose While the opinions have pointed out that to the beneficial purpose was added uncertainty on tax day whether the property would certainly soon go on they have also conceded that it was only temporarily present so that under the commerce clause they have really made beneficial purpose the test of taxability Such a test is not drawn from the language of the Constitution It must be drawn from the courts views of desirable and undesirable results Since the issue is fundamentally one of jurisdiction it seems natural to believe that the court would choose the same test of jurisdiction in whatever form the question may technically arise Even if it is conceded that temporary presence alone does not confer situs there still remains the difficulty of proving that on tax day the presence is certainly temporary This practical dif ficulty makes somewhat scholastic the discussion of what should be the legal principle Since presence for some beneficial pur pose confers situs however brief the time required for the ac complishment of that purpose proof that the presence is ephem eral can have importance only when no beneficial purpose appears Seldom can such proof be given except when the prop erty is substantially in the course of interstate transit We may be certain of the intention of the owner but his intention is not enough He may change his mind We may be confident of the future from the past course of business but this confidence can be proof only when definite purchasers in other jurisdictions have already bought the specific property in question When the property is actually on its way to such purchasers it will get exemption as a thing in transit Whether the doctrine that temporary presence does not create situs can ever have any practical importance apart from and in addition to the doctrine that things in transit are exempt under the commerce clause will depend largely upon whether the courts will ever be satisfied to infer ephemerality from proof of what is likely on tax day without demanding proof of what is absolutely certain at that time Judge Provosty is doubtless right in saying that for the solution of this question no rule has as yet been formulated and perhaps in the nature of things none can be the question being one more of fact than of 528TAXATION OF THINGS IN TRANSIT law 131 This means that relief from the taxation of things not in transit but present only temporarily and for no bene ficial purpose must be obtained almost exclusively in other courts than the Supreme Court of the United States With their power to make exceptions to the letter of a statute they may exempt a travelling circus even when concededly its transit is broken be cause it has stopped for a profitable exhibition They may be satisfied that furniture and automobiles are present only tem porarily 132 when if they were not so satisfied the Supreme Court could not find any evidence or absence of evidence on which to overrule them Thus though the Supreme Court has paid indirect homage to the theory that property though con cededly not in substantial course of interstate transit may still be entitled to exemption under the Fourteenth Amendment be cause its presence is ephemeral it has not yet put the theory in practice and is not likely often to do so The situation thus disclosed requires us to seek such practi cal justifications as can be found for imposing a years tax on property that is likely to be present only for a week Such a tax is in economics guilty of the vice of extraterritoriality even if the property taxed is reaping profit from its temporary stop A State is getting more than it deserves when it collects a years board for a weeks hospitality It is forbidden to do this by taking an excessive average of a succession of temporary pres ences of cars continually flitting in and out Why should it not be similarly restrained when it puts a years tax on a herd of cattle that comes in to feed for two or three months Grant that the cattle ought to pay something should they pay for a year Is there not in such a case as much reason for the sever ing judgment of Solomon as in the case of the procession of cars When a State does not content itself with levying its tax on a fixed day in the year but sets its tax trap so as to catch every mouse as it comes in its zeal seems especially worthy of con demnation It might well be required to grant a rebate when 13 Note 60 supra  Semple v Commonwealth note 79 supra 529VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW the property leaves or at least a rebate for such period as it is actually taxed elsewhere133 Such cases are however exceptional The normal situation is that in which tax day comes but once a year Property that merely chances to be passing through on that day is likely to es cape any levy either as a thing in transit or because its tempo rary presence yields it no special benefit If the property is held for sale within the State there is good reason to assume that it will stay in the State as long as it lasts It certainly cannot prove that its stay is to be short It should take its chance along with all other property that may soon be consumed or with drawn to other States A still stronger reason exists in favor of taxing the coal and oil and hardware that belong to a con tinuous though constantly changing stock If the tank is full all the year it should not matter that specific gallons come and go Instead of taking an average the State assesses what it finds on tax day which is what it does with the stock of every local merchant The concern engaged in continuous business has as good a chance to win as to lose by this annual sampling Somewhat rough and ready methods may be allowed when they are likely in most instances to be fair enough Something may be said too in favor of taxing even the prop erty that is all that its owner sends into a State In most in stances it has completely broken from its previous base so that it need not pay taxes there In this respect it differs from the ships and cars that travel on roundtrip tickets The only reasonable ground on which to exempt property from taxation where it is on tax day is the fair certainty that it is taxable somewhere else It should be awarded a situs where it is un less it is reasonably clear that it has not lost its situs where it was The possibility or practical certainty that it will soon ac quire a situs at some unknown place which it has not yet visited is not a strong ground on which to claim exemption Varying tax days in different States complicate the problem of fairness but the complication is so complicated and so uncertain that it 33 See the statutes involved in the cases cited in notes 84 and 124 supra 530TAXATION OF THINGS IN TRANSIT seems the lesser of two evils to disregard it Most persons en gaged in a continuous course of business will be as likely to have their property escape both tax days as to have it get caught on both In determining what is fundamentally a broad ques tion of policy regard must be had to the whole course of busi ness in the community at large Peripatetic chattels which have abandoned forever their place of origin are by and large much more likely to escape taxation altogether than to get taxed twice in any twelvemonths period There is good reason to hold that presence of indefinite duration for some beneficial purpose is sufficient for situs and to grant such exemptions under the commerce clause as are thought necessary in order to protect interstate commerce from undue burdens This raises the question whether things in transit should be exempted except when their transit does not save them from tax ation at their headquarters Should exemption ever be accorded except as the corollary of taxability elsewhere The dogma that the States cannot tax interstate commerce is now seen to be a dogma only and one not observed by the Supreme Court Property employed in interstate commerce is taxable and it may be valued at a capitalization of its earning power134 Net in come from interstate commerce is subject to levy by the States135 All the cases which have declared that the States can not tax interstate commerce will be found to be cases involving special rather than general taxes Whenever it has been certain that interstate commerce could not in some way be discrimi nated against the tax has been sustained The law on the tax ation of interstate commerce boils downs to a segregation of improper from proper methods of taxing that commerce36 It is settled that the taxation of things in interstate transit is an improper method of taxing interstate commerce There seems

and 902 passim 531VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW no good economic reason for this except when the transit sub jects the property to bijurisdictional double taxationwhen the property really suffers an extra imposition because it moves in interstate commerce There is however a more general practical reason Where there is no jurisdiction over the owner a tax cannot be made a personal liability137 It must be collected from the property taxed Such collection is possible only by seizure of the prop erty Property in the course of interstate transit is often not under the immediate control of its owner to impose a tax thereon would in many instances inevitably seriously interrupt the transit While this consideration does not prevent the at tachment of rolling stock in the course of interstate transit 188 and there is a hint that it would not prevent the seizure of such rolling stock for nonpayment of taxes139 yet it applies with stronger force to chattels on isolated interstate journeys The cars are taxable only when there is a more or less continuous course of business in the taxing State so that the owner has good warning that the tax is due and can guard against any in terruption of their transit So we may approve of exempting goods in actual course of interstate transit even when it may result in a bounty on interstate commerce But the realization that this exemption depends for its justification upon somewhat special considerations should prevent us from regarding it as a datum from which to argue for other exemptions when these special considerations are not applicable and when the economic argument in favor of exemption is not compelling 37 Dewey v Des Moines 1899 173 U S 193 19 Sup Ct 379 138 Lindsay  Phelps Co v Mullen 1900 176 U S 126 20 Sup Ct 325 Davis v Cleveland C C

176177 If the property have such character that all obligations of the com pany must yield to public use or to the obligations imposed by Congress the railroad company itself it might be contended cannot burden its property   Indeed the further consequence might be said to follow that the rolling stock of a railroad is exempt from taxation at least so far as taxation might be attempted to be enforced against the rolling stock 532TAXATION OF THINGS IN TRANSIT While most of the Supreme Courts interpretations of the commerce clause correspond to its conception of sitzus it is still possible as we have seen that due process may occasionally ex empt where concededly the property is not in transit If the test of sitts goes beyond the mere fact of presence to the pur pose of the presence property without the pale of the commerce clause may still here and there successfully plead the absence of any of the purposes requisite to the acquisition of situs It is to be borne in mind too that taxes which do not offend against any conception of situs and which therefore satisfy the Four teenth Amendment may still run afoul of other clauses of the Constitution Property of foreign as distinct from extraState origin is technically an import until it is sold or taken from the original package It is entitled to exemption until it loses its character as an import140 If the coal in Brown v Houston 141 had come from Newcastle instead of from Pittsburg it could not have been taxed There appears too a difference between taxes on property of extraState origin and taxes on sales of such property Prop erty that has ended its interstate transit and is offered for sale is not saved by the commerce clause from subjection to the gen eral property tax even though still in the original package But the original package protects against a tax on the sale of such property even to purchasers within the State142 unless the same is in some odd way as by auction 143 or by peddling144 Sales made by breaking the original package are taxable145 These distinctions are obviously the offspring of the commerce clause alone The offer for sale is sufficient proof that the owner is not planning to take his goods to a different jurisdiction From the standpoint of temporary presence and of general jurisdic tion to tax there is no difference between the sale of the whole 140 Low v Austin 1872

Askren v Continental Oil Co note 142 supra 533VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW package and the sale of a part The commerceclause exemp tion of the sale of the whole package is doubtless due to an ap prehension that a tax burden on every sale however made would be a barrier to the introduction of articles into the State Subjection to the general property tax is not conceived to be such a barrier except when the property is still in transit and the transit is good evidence that the property is not going to re main in the jurisdiction in which it is found on tax day This at least is the limit to which the Supreme Court decisions have gone We may infer that uncompleted transit in the jurisdic tion in which the transit is certain to terminate would prevent taxation but it has not yet done so Some of the exemptions under the commerce clause doubtless go beyond what would be required by a careful economic analy sis of practical results Some of the denials of exemption both under the commerce clause and under due process of law doubt less offend nice antipathies to extraterritorial taxation Biju risdictional double taxation of chattels is possible This might have been prevented had the Supreme Court taken the view of the minority in Gromer v Standard Dredging Co146 and treated the acquisition of a new situs for chattels in about the same way that courts treat the acquisition of a new domicil by individuals But such a view would frequently prevent the State in which property is located from getting fair compensation for the protection which it gives while at the same time the absence of the property from the domicil of its owner makes it easy to avoid the taxcollector there The tests which the Supreme Court has adopted represent a fair compromise be tween the desire to prevent double taxation and the reluctance to permit complete escape from taxation If we restrict our gaze to the particular chattel that resents being taxed we see that not infrequently it may be denied exemption from a levy that is guilty of a goodly measure of the vice of extraterri toriality But if the rules laid down are viewed in the light of all their possible applications to the myriad circumstances that 14 Note 40 supra 534TAXATION OF THINGS IN TRANSIT 535 may arise they are seen to represent a wise and usually success ful effort to steer between the Scylla of cumulative taxes and the Charybdis of no tax at all Now and then an extraordi nary case may turn up but constitutional law like other mortal contrivances has to take some chances and in the great ma jority of instances no doubt justice will be done 147 Thomas Reed Powell COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 14 Mr Justice Holmes in Blinn v Nelson 1911 222 U S 1 7 32 Sup Ct 1

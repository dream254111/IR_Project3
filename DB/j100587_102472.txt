J100587,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 16831775,102472,AN ACCOUNT OF BOOKS,I206883,AN ACCOUNT OF BOOKS 1 REFLECTIONS UPON ANCIENT AND MODERN LEARNING BY W WOTTON B D R S S AND CHAP LAIN TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE EARL OF NOT TINGHAM LONDON PRINTED FOR PETER BUCK AT THE SIGN OF THE TEMPLE NEAR THE INNER TEMPLEGATEFLEETSTREET IN OCTAVO 1694 T H E DESIGN OF THIS BOOK AS THE AUTHOR SAYS HIMSELF IN HIS PREFACE IS TO STATE THE BOUNDARIES OF ANCIENT AND MODERN LEARNING THAT SO MEN MAY KNOW265 KNOW WHICH TO RECUR TO AS THEIR GUIDES IF THEY WOULD BE MASTERS OF ANY PARTICULAR PART OF KNOWLEDGE IT BE ING IN HIS OPINION A VERY PERNICIOUS THING AND VERY DESTRUCTIVE TO THE INCREASE OF SOLID LEARNING TO REST UP ON THE ANCIENTS WHERE THE MODERNS HAVE SUCCEEDED THEM OR TO STUDY SECONDHAND BOOKS UPON SUBJECTS WHICH HAVE BEEN BORROWED FROM THE ANCIENTS ESPECIALLY SINCE HE PRETENDS TO PROVE THAT IN SOME THINGS EITHER OF THEM HAVE SO FAR OUTDONE THE OTHER THAT IT CANNOT BE A MAT TER OF DISPUTE AMONGST ABLE JUDGES TO WHICH SIDE ONE OUGHT TO GIVE THE PREFERENCE HEREUPON IN ORDER TO MAKE OUT THIS PROPOSITION HE DIVIDES HIS DISCOURSE INTO THREE GENERAL PARTS 1 HE ENQUIRES WHAT SCIENCES THE ANCIENTS MAY HAVE BEEN SUPPOSED TO BRING TO PERFECTION CHIEFLY BECAUSE THEY GOT THE START BY BEING BORN FIRST 2 WHEREIN THE ANCIENTS HAVE EXCELLED THE MODERNS AND WHY THEY MAY HAVE BEEN SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN SO 3 WHEREIN THE MODERNS HAVE OUT DONE THE ANCIENTS UNDER THE FIRST HEAD HE RECKONS ETHICKS AND POLITICKS UNDER THE SECOND ORATORY AND POESIE ALL THE OTHER PARTS OF LEARNING HAVE EITHER BEEN IMPROVED BY THE MODERNS OR THE QUESTION CANNOT WELL BE DECIDED CHAP 1 HE BEGINS WITH ETHICKS AND POLITICKS HERE HE SUP POSES THAT THE ANCIENTS MIGHT HAVE BEEN AS WELL SKILLED AS THE MODERNS SINCE NOTHING BUT EXPERIENCE IS REQUI SITE TO UNDERSTAND THOSE THINGS WHICH THE ANCIENT AE GYPTIANS GREEKS AND ROMANS COULD NOT MISS OF WHO LIVED IN FORMED SOCIETIES FOR SO MANY AGES ACCORDINGLY HE INSTANCES IN ARISTOTLES ETHICKS TO NICOMACHUS XENO PHONS CYRUS THEOPHRASTUSS CHARECTERS TULLYS OFFICES AND SEVERAL OTHER ANCIENT BOOKS AS MASTERPIECES IN THEIR RESPECTIVE KINDS OF MORAL AND POLITICAL KNOWLEDGE YET ALL THIS ACCORDING TO OUR AUTHOR REQUIRES NO PAR TICULAR STRENGTH OF GENIUE TO COMPLEAT IT SINCE THE CHI NESES AND PERUVIANS SEEM TO HAVE DONE AS GREAT THINGS NESES THE RAISING OF WISE AND LASTING GOVERNMENTS TOWARDS266 WHICH MUST BE THE EFFECTS OF EXTRAORDINARY SKILL IN THIS PART OF KNOWLEDGE AS ANY OF THOSE NATIONS WHICH ARE SO MUCH COMMENDED FOR CIVIL PRUDENCE CHAP 2 NEXT HE GOES TO ORATORY AND POESIE HE SUPPOSES THAT VIRGIL AND HOMER AND HORACE AND TERENCE MAY HAVE BEEN BETTER POETS THAN ANY OF THE MODERNS IN THEIR SE VERAL WAYS AND THAT DEMOSTHENES AND CICERO HAVE NOT BEEN EQUALLED BY MODERN ORATORS HE THINKS THAT THE EXCELLENCY OF THE GREEK POETRY MIGHT AT FIRST PROCEED FROM THE MANAGEABLENESS OF THE GREEK LANGUAGE AND AFTERWARDS FROM THE GREAT VENERATION WHICH WAS PAID TO THEIR POETS WHICH MADE VERY MANY PUT IN FOR THE PRIZE OF WHOM SOME FEW ONE OR TWO AT LEAST OF A SORT ARRI VED TO SO GREAT AN EXCELLENCY THAT OTHERS HAVE DESPAIRED TO EQUAL THEM SINCE IMITATION IN THOSE THINGS NOT ONLY NEAUSEATES BUT CLOGS MENS PARTS THE CONSTITUTION OF THEIR GOVERNMENTS WHICH WERE CHIEFLY REPUBLICAN OB LIGED THEM LIKEWISE TO STUDY ORATORY AS A LIKELY WAY TO RISE IN THEIR SEVERAL STATES FOR WHICH REASON AS A MONGST MANY RIVALS SOME GREW VERY EXCELLENT SO WHEN THEIR LIBERTY WAS TAKEN AWAY BY THE MACEDONIANS THEIR ELOQUENCE DECAYED ALONG WITH IT THE SAME REA SONS MAY IN HIS OPINION BE ASSIGNED FOR THE RISE AND DE CAY OF THE ROMAN ELOQUENCE AND POETRY THOUGH IN SOME SORT OF COMPOSURES HISTORIES FOR EXAMPLE WHERE ORATORY HAS BUT A SECONDARY SHARE HE BELIEVES THAT THE MODERNS MAY HAVE EQUALLED THE ANCIENTS AND HE THINKS THAT THE MEMOIRS OF PHILIP COMINES AND F PAULS HISTORY OF THE COUNCIL OF TRENT MAY BE SET AGAINST ANY OF THE HISTORIES OF THE ANCIENTS WITH WHICH IT CAN BE PROPER TO COMPARE THEM CHAP 3 THIS LEADS HIM TO EXAMINE MONSIEUR PERRAULTS HYPO THESIS WHO ASSERTS THAT MODERN ELOQUENCE AND MODERN POETRY ARE PREFERRABLE TO THE ANCIENT THERE HE GOES THROUGH THE SEVERAL REASONS WHICH MONSIEUR PERRAULT BRINGS TO ESTABLISH HIS HYPOTHESIS AND CONCLUDES THAT THEY267 THEY ARE INSUFFICIENT PARTICULARLY HE SEEMS TO THINK IT VERY HARD MEASURE THAT THE TRANSLATIONS OF THE PIECES OF ELOQUENCE OF THE ANCIENTS SHOULD BE SET AGAINST ORI GINAL PIECES OF THE MODERNS SINCE EVERY LANGUAGE HAS BEAUTIES OF ITS OWN WHICH CAN NEVER BE REACHED IN ANO THER THOUGH NEVER SO EXACT AND ELEGANT CHAP 4 IN THE FIFTH CHAPTER HE CONSIDERS ANCIENT AND MODERN GRAMMAR AS IT COMES UNDER THE COGNIZANCE OF CRITICKS OR OF PHILOSOPHERS FOR THE FIRST WHICH HE CALLS ME CHANICAL GRAMMAR HE SUPPOSES THAT SOME MODERNS HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE ANALOGY OF THE GREEK AND LATIN AS WELL AS ANY OF THE ANCIENTS AND HE THINKS THAT MODERN TONGUES HAVE BEEN AS CRITICALLY SCANNED AS ANY OF THE ANCIENT ONES ESPECIALLY ENGLISH AND FRENCH WHICH HE PARTICULARLY INSTANCES IN FOR PHILOSOPHICAL GRAMMAR HE RECOMMENDS BISHOP WILKINSS ESSAY TOWARDS A REAL CHARACTER AND PHILOSOPHICAL LANGUAGE AND THE THIRD BOOK OF MR LOCKS ESSAY OF HUMAN UNDERSTANDING AS ORIGINAL PIECES THAT ANTIQUITY HAS NOTHING TO SET A GAINST CHAP 5 WHEN HE COMES TO COMPARE ANCIENT AND MODERN AR CHITECTURE STATUARY AND PAINTING HE ABRIDGES WHAT MONSIEUR PERRAULT HAD SAID ALREADY UPON THE SAME SUB JECTS IN HIS PARALLEL OF THE ANCIENTS AND MODERNS WHERE IN HE GIVES THE MODERNS EVERY WHERE THE PREFERENCE WITHOUT INTERPOSING HIS OWN JUDGMENT CHAP 6 AFTER THIS HE COMES TO ENQUIRE INTO ANCIENT AND MO DERN PHILOSOPHY AND MATHEMATICKS BUT BEFORE HE SPEAKS PARTICULARLY OF THEM HE EXAMINES SIR W TS HYPO THESIS OF THE HISTORY OF LEARNING STEP BY STEP AGAINST WHOSE ESSAY UPON ANCIENT AND MODERN LEARNING A GREAT PART OF HIS BOOK SEEMS TO BE LEVELLED SIR WILLIAM TEMPLE HAD EXCEEDINGLY COMMENDED THE LEARNING OF PYTHAGORAS AND THE ANCIENT SAGES OF GREECE AS ALSO THAT OF THE OLD AEGYPTIANS CHALDEANS ARABS INDIANS AND CHINESES OUR AUTHOR THINKS THAT PYTHAGORASS CHIEF EXCEL268 EXCELLENCY LAY IN POLITICAL KNOWLEDGE AND THAT THOUGH HE WAS A BETTER MATHEMATICIAN AND PHILOSOPHER THAN ANY MAN OF THAT TIME YET SINCE HE IS COMMENDED CHIEFLY FOR FINDING THE XLVII PROPOSITION OF THE FIRST BOOK OF EUCLID HIS SKILL IN THOSE MATTERS WAS COMPARATIVELY SPEAKING BUT VERY INDIFFERENT WHICH HE ALSO AFFIRMS OF THE ANCIENT SAGES CHAP 7 8 FROM THEM HE GOES TO THE EGYPTIANS OF WHOM HE OBSERVES THAT MORE MAY BE CHALLENGED FROM THEM THAN FROM OTHER NATIONS BECAUSE THEIR PRETENCES TO EXACTNESS IN RECORDING INVENTIONS AND TRADITIONS HAVE BEEN MORE CONSIDERABLE YET HE THINKS THAT THEIR HISTORY COULD NOT BE EXTRAORDINARY SINCE BOTH THE TIME WHEN THE PYRAMIDS WERE BUILT AND THAT WHEN THEIR GREAT HERO SESOSTRIS LIVED COULD NEVER BE DETERMINED BY THE ANCI ENTEST WRITERS NOW EXTANT THAT ALL THE GREAT ANCIENT INVENTIONS IN GEOMETRY THOUGH ITS ORIGINAL BE OWING TO THEM ARE CONVEYED TO US BY GREEKS AS THEIR OWN IN VENTIONS THAT THEIR MEDICINE WAS WHOLLY BUILT UPON ASTROLOGICAL OR MAGICAL GROUNDS THAT THEIR PRETENCES TO THE PHILOSOPHERS STONE SEEM TO HAVE BEEN FATHERD UPON THEM BY LATER ALCHEMISTS THAT THEIR SKILL IN ANA TOMY WAS SO SMALL THAT THEY BELIEVED THAT THE HEART INCREASED ANNUALLY TWO DRACHMS IN WEIGHT TILL MEN WERE 50 YEARS OLD AND AFTERWARDS DECREASED AS GRADUALLY FOR WHICH REASON ACCORDING TO THEM NO MAN COULD LIVE ABOVE 100 YEARS THAT WITH ALL THEIR BOASTED CU RIOSITY THEY SEEM NEVER TO HAVE FAILED 200 MILES DOWN THE NILE INTO AETHIOPIA SINCE TILL ABOUT PLATOS TIME THEY COULD NOT GIVE A CLEAR SOLUTION OF THE ANNUAL IN UNDATIONS OF THAT WONDERFUL RIVER AND IN SHORT THAT THEIR GREATEST SKILL LAY IN MAKING WIFE AND PRUDENT LAWS WHICH WERE WORTH GOING SO FAR AS THE GREEKS WENT TO FETCH THEM CHAP 9 10 HE THINKS THAT THE CHALDEAN LEARNING WAS NOT SO EX CELLENT AS THE AEGYPTIAN THAT THE ASSYRIAN HISTORYWHICH WE269 WE HAVE FROM THE CHALDEANS CONTRADICTS THE JEWISH THAT THE CHALDEAN ASTROLOGY WAS DOWNRIGHT KNAVERY AND THAT FOR OTHER THINGS HAD THEY BEEN VERY CONSIDE RABLE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE MEMORIALS OF THEM PRESERVED THE ARABIAN LEARNING IS ACCORDING TO HIM ALL IN A MANNER OWING TO THE GREEKS SO THAT ITS ANTI QUITY OR EXTENT CANNOT HERE BE ALLEDGED CHAP 11 HE BELIEVES THE CHINESE NATURAL KNOWLEDGE TO BE VERY INCONSIDERABLE AND THEIR SPECULATIVE SKILL IN MEDICINE ENTIRELY PHANTASTICAL TO PROVE WHICH HE PRODUCES A LONG CITATION OUT OF AN OLD CHINESE BOOK CALLED NUY KIM PRINTED BY CLEYER IN HIS SPECIMENS OF CHINESE PHY SICK CHAP 12 HE DIVIDES THE GRECIAN LEARNING INTO FOUR PARTS LO GICK METAPHYSICKS MATHEMATICKS AND PHYSICKS LOGICK AS IT IS THE ART OF DISPUTATION AND METHOD IS IN HIS O PINION TO BE ASCRIBED TO THE ANCIENTS AS IT IS THE ART OF INVENTION IT IS MORE OWING TO THE MODERNS SINCE THE METHODS OF INVENTION WHICH THE ANCIENTS MADE USE OF SEEM TO BE ENTIRELY LOST HERE HE COMMENDS DES CARTESS MEDITATIONS TSCHIRNHAUSS MEDICINA MENTIS AND MRLOCKS ESSAY OF HUMANE UNDERSTANDING IN METAPHYSICKS HE THINKS THE WRITINGS OF DES CARTES AND HIS FOLLOWERS MAY BE SET AGAINST ALL THAT THE PLATONISTS SAY UPON THOSE SUBJECTS THOUGH THEY OF ALL THE ANCIENTS DISCOURSE THE MOST UPON SPIRITS AND INCORPOREAL SUBSTANCES CHAP 13 WHEN HE SPEAKS OF ANCIENT AND MODERN MATHEMATICKS HE PRODUCES A DISCOURSE OF THAT EXCELLENT GEOMETER MR JOHN CRAIG WHO ENDEAVOURS TO PROVE THAT MODERN GEOMETRY IS OF INFINITELY LARGER EXTENT THAN THE ANCI ENT AND THAT IT HAS BEEN ENLARGED BY METHODS IN A GOOD MEASURE UNKNOWN TO OR AT LEAST NOT COMPARA TIVELY CULTIVATED BY THE ANCIENTS WHICH ARE ALGEBRA AND THE METHOD OF INDIVISIBLES THE PARTICULAR ADVAN TAGES OF THE FORMER OF WHICH IN IMPROVING ARITHMETICK AND GEOMETRY HE DOES AT LARGE INSIST UPON CHAP 14 S S AFTER270 AFTERWARDS WHEN HE COMES TO PHYSICKS OUR AUTHOR OBSERVES THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL INSTRUMENTS AND ARTS WHICH ARE NECESSARY TOOLS TO A GOOD PHILOSOPHER THAT HAVE BEEN EITHER INVENTED OR VERY MUCH IMPROVED BY MODERNS FOR WANT OF WHICH IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE ANCIENTS TO UNDERSTAND NATURE SO WELL AS IT HAS SINCE BEEN UNDERSTOOD AMONG INSTRUMENTS WHOLLY MODERN HE RECKONS 1 PRINTING WHICH IS USEFUL TO ALL LEARNED MEN ALIKE 2 ENGRAVING UPON WOOD AND COPPER WHICH IS PECULIARLY USEFUL TO ALL WRITERS OF NATURAL HI STORY AND MATHEMATICKS 3 TELESCOPES FIRST INVEN TED BY ZACHARIAS JOANNIDES A SPECTACLEMAKER OF MID DLEBURGH ABOUT THE YEAR 1590 WHEREBY THE HEAVENS HAVE BECOME MORE ACCESSIBLE TO MODERN ASTRONOMERS THAN THEY WERE TO THE ANCIENTS 4 MICROSCOPES THE INVENTION OF THE SAME JOANNIDES OF INFINITE USE IN DIS COVERING THE TEXTURE OF MINUTE BODIES 5 BARO SCOPES BY WHICH THE COMPARATIVE GRAVITATION OF AIR UPON TERRESTRIAL BODIES MAY BE FOUND OUT 6 THER MOMETERS TO ADJUST THE VARIATIONS OF HEAT AND COLD 7 AIRPUMPS VERY USEFUL IN DISCOVERING MANY HID DEN PROPERTIES OF THE AIR 8 PENDULUM CLOCKS NE CESSARY FOR ASTRONOMERS IN MEASURING SMALL SUBDIVISIONS OF TIME WHEN THEY MAKE THEIR OBSERVATIONS CHAP15 AMONGST PRELIMINARY ARTS HE RECKONS CHYMISTRY AND ANATOMY BY CHYMISTRY HE UNDERSTANDS THE ART OF SE PARATING BODIES BY FIRE AND HE OBSERVES THAT THOUGH THE ANCIENTS COULD REFINE METALS FROM THEIR DROSS TO A GOOD DEGREE YET FOR WANT OF AQUA FORTIS THEY COULD NOT PART THEM FROM ONE ANOTHER SO WELL AS THEY CAN AT PRESENT HE SAYS CHYMISTRY PROPERLY SO CALLED IS MOSTLY OWING TO THE ARABS AND THAT THE GREEKS KNEW SCARCE ANY THING AT ALL OF IT BUT YET THAT THE USE OF CHY MICAL PREPARATIONS IN PHYSICK IS ALMOST ENTIRELY OWING TO THE PHYSICIANS OF THIS AND THE LAST AGE SINCE THE TIME OF PARACELSUS CHAP 16 OF271 OF ANATOMY HE SAYS THAT THE ANCIENTS SKILL IN IT REACHED ONLY TO THOSE PARTS THAT ARE DISCOVERABLE BY THE NAKED EYE AND EVEN THERE NOT SO FAR AS THE MODERNS HAVE CARRYD IT IN ANY ONE PARTICULAR THAT THE EXTENT OF THE ANCIENTS KNOWLEDGE IN THAT MATTER MAY BE CER TAINLY KNOWN FROM THE ANATOMICAL DISCOURSES OF GALEN THAT IF WE DESCEND TO PARTICULARS THE ANATOMY OF THE BRAIN WAS NOT KNOWN TO ANY TOLERABLE DEGREE BEFORE MALPIGHIUS AND WILLIS THAT THE ANCIENTS KNEW LITTLE OF THE TEXTURE OF THE EYE IN COMPARISON OF WHAT MAY BE FOUND IN THE WRITINGS OF DR BRIGGS THAT THE GLANDS WHICH SUPPLY IT WITH MOISTURE ARE BY NO BODY SO WELL DESCRIBED AS BY MONSIEUR NUCK THAT THE EAR WITH ITS INNER CAVITIES WAS LITTLE KNOWN BEFORE MONSIEUR DU VERNEY THAT THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE TEXTURE OF THE TONGUE IS OWING TO MALPIGHIUS OF THE GLANDS OF THE MOUTH JAWS AND NECK TO WHARTON STENO AND NUCK AND OF THE LUNGS TO MALPIGHIUS THAT THE PRIMARY USE OF THE LUNGS WAS WHOLLY UNKNOWN TO THE ANCIENTS WHO HAD NO NOTION OF THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD SINCE ALL THAT CAN BE COLLECTED FROM THE WRITINGS OF HIP POCRATES PLATO AND ARISTOTLE IS THAT THE BLOOD HAD A CONSTANT RECURRENT MOTION THROUGH THE BODY WHICH THEY COULD NOT DISTINCTLY DESCRIBE THAT THIS MOTION THROUGH THE VEINS TO THE RIGHT VENTRICLE OF THE HEART THENCE THROUGH THE LUNGS INTO THE LEFT AND SO THROUGH THE ARTERIES OVER THE WHOLE BODY TILL IT MEETS AGAIN WITH THE VEINS FIRST CALLED BY CAESALPINUS THE CIRCULA TION OF THE BLOOD WAS FIRST DISCOVERED BY SERVETUS THEN PURSUED SOMEWHAT FURTHER BY COLUMBUS AND CAESAL PINUS AND AT LAST MADE PERFECTLY INTELLIGIBLE BY DR HAR VEY WHOSE DISCOVERIES WERE LATELY MADE COMPLEAT BY MONS LEUWENHOEK THAT THE TEXTURE OF THE HEART WAS FIRST DISCOVERED BY DR LOWER OF THE COATS OF THE STO MACK BY DRWILLIS OF THE FIBRES OF THE INTESTINES BY DR COLE OF THE CHYLIFEROUS VESSELS BY ASSELLIUS AND S S 2 PECQUET272 PECQUET OF THE LACTEAL VESSELS IN WOMEN BY MONSIEUR NUCK AND OF THE LIVER BY MALPIGHIUS THAT THE DU CTUS PANCREATICUS WAS FIRST DISCOVERED BY WIRTSUNGUS AND THE SPLEEN AND THE REINS FOUND TO BE GLANDULOUS BODIES BY MALPIGHIUS THAT THE LYMPHA AND ITS DUCTS WERE NEVER THOUGHT OF TILL THEY WERE DISCOVERED BY BARTHO LIN RUDBECK AND JOLLIFFE THAT DR HAVERS FOUND OUT THE MUCILAGE IN THE JOYNTS WITH THE GLANDS WHICH PRE SERVE IT AND LASTLY THAT THE ANATOMY OF BRUITS HAS BEEN AS CAREFULLY EXAMINED AS THAT OF MEN OF WHICH HE GIVES SEVERAL INSTANCES CHAP 17 18 19 IN TREATING OF PHILOSOPHY HE BEGINS WITH NATURAL HISTORY AND WITH THAT OF ELEMENTARY BODIES AND MI NERALS AS THE SIMPLEST HE OBSERVES THAT THE ANCIENTS KNEW LITTLE OF THE NATURE OF AIR THAT THOUGH ARISTOTLE BELIEVED IT TO GRAVITATE YET HIS DISCIPLES SO LITTLE UNDER STOOD HIM THAT THEY ASSERTED THE QUITE CONTRARY THAT THE DOCTRINE OF ITS SPRING IS OWING TO OUR TRULY NOBLE COUNTRYMAN MR BOYLE WHOSE HISTORIES OF THE MOST CON SPICUOUS QUALITIES OF TERRESTRIAL BODIES HAVE MUCH EN LARGED THAT PART OF NATURAL HISTORY IN HIS ACCOUNT OF MINERALS HE INSTANCES IN THE LOADSTONE WHOSE NOBLEST PROPERTIES WERE ANCIENTLY UNKNOWN AND HE ENLARGES UPON THEIR USE WITH THE INCREASE OF WEALTH AND KNOW LEDGE WHICH THEREBY HAVE ACCRUED TO THESE EUROPEAN NATIONS IN THESE TWO LAST AGES CHAP 20 OF THE NATURAL HISTORY OF PLANTS HE OBSERVES THAT ALL ANCIENT DESCRIPTIONS ARE CONFUSED AND LAME AND IN NUMBER VERY DEFICIENT THAT NOTHING WHICH THEY DID CAN BE COMPARED WITH GERHARDS PARKINSONS AND BAU HINES HERBALS MUCH LESS WITH MR RAYS WHO FIRST DREW UP A METHODICAL HISTORY OF ALL THE PLANTS YET KNOWN CHAP 21 OF INFECTS HE OBSERVES THAT THE ANCIENTS ONLY MED LED WITH THE MOST REMARKABLE SORTS AND THERE RARELY TOOK NOTICE OF ANY BUT THE MOST CONSPICUOUS THINGS SO273 SO THAT ALL WHICH MALPIGHIUS AND RHEDI SAY CONCERNING THEIR GENERATION ALL THAT IS IN THE WRITINGS OF GOEDAR TIUS AND SWAMMERDAM CONCERNING THE TIME AND NATURE OF THEIR TRANSMUTATIONS MAY BE LOOKED UPON AS WHOLLY NEW AND AS FOR HISTORIES OF LARGER ANIMALS HE PRE TENDS THAT WILLOUGHBYS HISTORIES OF BIRDS AND FISHES RAYS SYNOPSIS OF QUADRUPEDS BESIDES A GREAT MANY MODERN DISCOURSES UPON PARTICULAR ANIMALS ARE WITHOUT COM PARISON BETTER THAN THE HISTORIES OF ARISTOTLE AELIAN OR PLINY CHAP 22 AFTERWARDS HE INSERTS A DISCOURSE WRITTEN BY THAT MOST EXCELLENT ASTRONOMER MR HALLEY CONCERNING ANCIENT AND MODERN ASTRONOMY AND OPTICKS WHO SAYS THAT THE AEGYPTIAN AND CHALDEAN ASTRONOMY WAS LITTLE WORTH IN IT SELF AND THE GREEK ASTRONOMY NOT MUCH BETTER IF COMPARED WITH THE MODERN THAT PTOLEMYS HYPOTHESIS OF THE PLANETARY MOTIONS CANNOT BE SET AGAINST KEPLERS AND NEWTONS NOR HIPPARCHUSS CATALOGUE OF THE FIXT STARS AGAINST TYCHO BRAHES AND HERELIUSS THAT THE ANCIENTS COULD KNOW BUT LITTLE OF OPTICKS SINCE THEY WERE SO MEANLY SKILLED IN PERSPECTIVE AND OF DIOPTRICKS THEY WERE WHOLLY IGNORANT SINCE THEY HAD NO NOTION OF THE PROPERTIES OF REFRACTION WHICH DES CARTES FIRST REDUCED TO A SCIENCE CHAP 23 OF MUSICK HE DETERMINES NOTHING POSITIVELY BUT SEEMS TO THINK THAT SINCE THE GROUNDS OF MUSICK HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THE SAME AND THAT THE MODERNS USE MORE GRADA TIONS OF HALFNOTES AND QUARTERNOTES THAN THE ANCIENTS AND THAT THE SYMPHONYS OF THE ANCIENTS WERE ONLY CON SORTS OF SEVERAL VOICES AND INSTRUMENTS TO THE SAME PART THAT MODERN MUSICK CONSIDERED AS ART IS PERFECTER THAN THE ANCIENT WHICH WAS SO MUCH EXTOLLED BY THOSE THAT HEARD IT BECAUSE IT WAS THE MOST EXCELLENT THEY HAD EVER HEARD AND SO HAD A RIGHT TO THE GREATEST COM MENDATIONS WHICH THEY COULD GIVE IT CHAP 24 OF274 OF MEDICKS ALSO HE DETERMINES NOTHING AS TO ANCI NT AND MODERN METHODS OF PRACTICE ONLY ALLOWS HIP POCRATES TO HAVE BEEN A VERY GREAT GENIUS PERHAPS NOT EQUALLED BY ANY PHYSICIAN THAT HAVE COME SINCE YET CONSIDERING HOW MUCH BOTANICKS CHYMISTRY AND ANA TOMY HAVE BEEN ENLARGED HE THINKS THAT MODERN THEO RIES OF DISEASES ARE MUCH MORE VALUABLE THAN ANCIENT ONES FOR WANT OF THOSE HELPSCOULD POSSIBLY BE CHAP25 IN SPEAKING TO ANCIENT AND MODERN METHODS OF PHILO SOPHIZING HE GIVES THE PREFERENCE TO THE LATTER BECAUSE NO PRINCIPLES OF NATURE ARE THERE ALLOWED BUT WHAT ARE IN THEMSELVES INTELLIGIBLE AND THE BUSINESS OF FORMING PARTIES IS NOW IN A MANNER OUT OF DOORS AND MATHE MATICAL REASONINGS ARE CONSTANTLY URGED AS VALID WAYS OF PROOF IN ALL PHYSICAL ENQUIRIES WHERE THEY CAN BE BROUGHT IN HEREUPON HE TAKES OCCASION TO ENLARGE UPON THE DESIGN OF THE R O Y A L S O C I E T Y AND HINTS AT THE GREAT THINGS WHICH ITS MEMBERS HAVE EFFECTED TO WARDS THE COMPLEATING OF PHYSICAL KNOWLEDGE CH 26 HAVING GONE THROUGH THOSE SCIENCES WHICH LYE EQUALLY OPEN TO MEN OF ALL AGES TO MAKE DISCOVERIES IN HE GOES ON TO THOSE WHICH HAVE THEIR WHOLE FOUNDATION IN ANTI QUITY WHEREIN BY CONSEQUENCE THE MODERNS SEEM TO HAVE NO PRETENCE TO A COMPARISON SUCH AS PHILOLOGY AND DIVINITY YET HE SAYS THAT IF WE CONSIDER HOW MUCH PRINTING HAS ALTERED THE STATE OF LEARNING HOW WIDE A THING ANTIQUITY IS IN ALL ITS COMPASS HOW MANY THINGS RARELY MEETING IN ONE MAN ARE REQUISITE TO MAKE A MAN A THROUGH CRITICK WE OUGHT TO CONCLUDE THAT THOUGH EVERY AGE OF ANTIQUITY KNEW IT SELF BETTER THAN WE CAN PRETEND TO KNOW IT YET IN THE GROSS THE SCALI GERS THE VOSSIUSS THE USHERS THE SELDENS THE BOCHARTS AND SUCH MODERN PHILOLOGERS HAVE HAD A GREATER EXTENT OF ANCIENT LEARNING THAN ANY SINGLE MAN AMONG THE ANCIENTS COULD POSSIBLY HAVE CHAP 27 AND275 AND AS TO DIVINITY HE SAYS THAT THOUGH THE SCRIP TURES AND THE WRITINGS OF THE ANCIENT FATHERS BE THE FOUNDATIONS UPON WHICH EVERY DIVINE OUGHT TO BUILD YET IF WE CONSIDER THAT THE TEXT OF THE BIBLE IT SELF BY A FAMILIAR CONVERSATION WITH THE ORIENTAL LANGUAGES IS NOW BETTER UNDERSTOOD THAT CASUISTICAL KNOWLEDGE LIES AS OBVIOUS NOW AS EVER IT DID THAT THE ART OF PREACH ING IS MORE METHODICAL AND BY CONSEQUENCE MORE IN STRUCTIVE THAT CONTROVERSIES HAVE BEEN MANAGED MORE NICELY AND MORE EXACTLY WE MUST ALLOW MODERN DI VINES TO HAVE BEEN THE BETTER WORKMEN THOUGH THE MAT TER WHICH BOTH THEY AND THE ANCIENTS HAVE JOYNTLY WROUGHT UPON HAS BEEN THE SAME CHAP 28 HIS LAST CHAPTER IS EMPLOYED ABOUT ANSWERING SOME REASONS WHICH SIR W T ASSIGNS FOR THE DECAY OF LEARN ING SUCH AS 1 DISPUTES IN RELIGION WHICH IN HIS OPINION HAVE RATHER INCREASED KNOWLEDGE THAN OTHER WISE SINCE THE SPIRIT OF OPPOSITION WHEN ONCE RAISED WILL SHEW IT SELF IN EVERY THING AS WELL AS IN THOSE MAT TERS WHICH FIRST GAVE IT LIFE 2 WANT OF FAVOUR FROM GREAT MEN OF WHICH ACCORDING TO HIM THERE IS NOT SO MUCH REASON TO COMPLAIN CONSIDERING THAT THE FRENCH KING Q CHRISTINA AND SEVERAL OTHERS WHOM HE THERE MENTIONS LIVED ALL OF THEM IN THIS AGE 3 PEDAN TRY WHICH ALSO HE PRETENDS TO BE IN A MANNER QUITE BA NISHT OUT OF THE WORLD THE WHOLE BOOK SEEMS TO BE DESIGNED FOR A VINDICA TION OF THAT SORT OF LEARNING WHICH IT IS THE INTENTION OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY TO PROMOTE FOR WHICH REASON PRO BABLY HE TOOK NO NOTICE THAT HE HAD THE HONOUR TO BE A MEMBER OF THAT BODY 2 HORTI276 2 HORTI MALABARICI PARS DECIMA UNDECIMA DUODE CIMA  ULTIMA WITH SOME REMARKS UPON THEM BY T R M D S R S NINE TOMES OF THIS GREAT

UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO AND MR ROCKEFELLER AT the convocation of the University of Chicago on December 20 the following letter from Mr John D Rockefeller to the president and trustees was read I have this day caused to be set aside for the University of Chicago from the funds of the General Education Board which are subject to my disposition incomebearing securities of the pres ent market value of approximately ten million dol lars the same to be delivered to the university in ten equal annual instalments beginning Jan 1 1911 each instalment to bear income to the uni versity from the date of such delivery only In a separate letter of even date my wishes regarding the investment and uses of the fund are more specifically expressed It is far better that the university be supported and enlarged by the gifts of many than by those of a single donor This I have recognized from the beginning and accordingly have sought to assist you in enlisting the interest and securing the con tributions of many others at times by making my own gifts conditional on the gifts of others and at times by aiding you by means ot unconditional gifts to make the university as widely useful worthy and attractive as possible Most heartily do I recognize and rejoice in the generous response of the citizens of Chicago and the West Their contributions to the resources of the uni versity have been I believe more than seven mil lion dollars It might perhaps be difficult to find a parallel to generosity so large and so widely distributed as this exercised in behalf of an insti tution so recently founded I desire to express my appreciation also of the extraordinary wisdom and fidelity which you as president and trustees have shown in conducting the affairs of the uni versity In the multitude of students so quickly gathered in the high character of the institution in the variety and extent of original research in the valuable contributions to human knowledge in the uplifting influence of the university as a whole upon education throughout the West my highest hopes have been far exceeded It is these con siderations with others that move me to sum up in a single and final gift distributing its payment over a period of many years to come such further contributions as I have purposed to make to the university The sum I now give is intended to make provi sion with such gifts as may reasonably be ex pected from others for such added buildings equipment and endowment as the department thus far established will need This gift completes the task which I have set before myself The found ing and support of new departments or the devel opment of the varied and alluring field of applied science including medicine I leave to the wisdom of the trustees as funds may be furnished for these purposes by other friends of the university In making an end of my gifts to the university as I now do and in withdrawing from the board of trustees my personal representatives whose resignations I enclose I am acting on an early and permanent conviction that this great institu tion being the property of the people should be controlled conducted and supported by the peo ple in whose generous efforts for its upbuilding I have been permitted simply to cooperate and I could wish to consecrate anew to the great cause of education the funds which I have given if that were possible to present the institution a second time in so far as I have aided in founding it to the people of Chicago and the West and to 950 SCIENCEDECEMNBER 30 1910 express my hope that under their management and with their generous support the university may be an increasing blessing to them to their children and to future generations Very truly yours JOHN D ROOKEFM3LLER The trustees in adopting a resolution ex pressing their grateful appreciation of Mr Rockefellers generosity ordered spread upon the records a minute a copy of which will be engraved and conveyed to Mr Rockefeller by a special committee of the board The minute reads in part The board of trustees of the University of Chi cago accepts the gift made by Mr Rockefeller and pledges itself to carry out in the spirit as well as in the letter the conditions accompanying it It is now twentyone years since in May 1889 Mr Rockefeller made his first gift to the University of Chicago This final gift will make the total amount which the university will have received from its founder approximately thirtyfive million dollars We know of no parallel in the history of edu cational benefactions to gifts so munificent be stowed upon a single institution of learning But unique as they are in amount they are still more remarkable for the spirit in which they have been bestowed Mr Rockefeller has never permitted the university to bear nis name and consented to be called its founder only at the urgent request of the board of trustees He has never suggested the appointment or removal of any professor What ever views may have been expressed by members of the faculty he has never indicated either assent or dissent He has never interfered directly or in directly with that freedom of opinion and expres sion which is the vital breath of a university but has adhered without deviation to the principle that while it is important that university pro fessors in their conclusions be correct it is more important that in their teaching they be free More significant still this principle has been maintained even in his attitude toward the teach ing of a subject so intimate as religion wherein the mind is keenly sensitive to differences of opinion Although at times doctrines have been voieaed in the university which traverse those the founder is known to hold he has never shown a desire to restrain that freedom which is quite as precious in theology as in other fields of thought Such a relationship between a great benefactor and the institution which he has founded affords a motto for educational benefaction through all time to come SOIENTIFIC NOTES AND NEWS IN this issue of SCIENCE is published the ad dress of the retiring president of the Ameri can Association for the Advancement of Sci ence

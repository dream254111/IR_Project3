j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1011072,Health Problems of the Negroes,i242615,HEALTH PROBLEMS OF THE NEGROES BY JOHN A KENNEY MD Tuskegee Institute Ala It is gratifying to state that the Negroes are becoming very active in the crusade against preventable diseases In many places without quibbling over such academic questions as whether the Negro is dying as rapidly as some other people or whether there is some racial inherency productive of its high mortality or whether it is due to environment the race is realizing that its death rate is high that certain diseases are taking more than their fair toll of human life from its ranks and that many of these diseases are preventable With this realization many Negroes have set to work to improve their living conditions and reduce mortality As might be expected the medical profession was among the first to realize this and to seek for improvement In the year I895 the National Medical Association composed of representative Negroes in the practice of medicine dentistry and pharmacy was organized in the city of Atlanta with the object of improving the conditions of Negro professional men and through them helping to educate the masses along the line of better health and right living The influence of this organization has been felt in most of the country east of the Mississippi river from Boston in the North to Atlanta in the South At its annual sessions one of the chief features has been at least one public session for the benefit of the people when subjects of popular interest are discussed in simple language Among the topics thus presented are the following The Cause Prevention and Treatment of Tuberculosis Infant Mortality The Proper Care and Feeding of Infants etc That these discussions have been appreciated by the laity is attested by the fact that they have always been given in crowded halls and we have every reason to believe that they have done good Before the organization of the National Medical Association there were in existence few state and local medical societies among 354Health Problems of the Tegroes the Negroes Most of those that were in existence have affiliated with the National and a great many others have been organized under its influence At the present time nearly every state having a sufficient number of Negro physicians has its medical society and aside from this nearly all the cities and many of the large towns also have local societies and almost without exception to a variable degree they are striving to help the Negro people attain to higher planes of living and thus improve their health and reduce their death rate Early in the year I9I0 the executive board of the National Medical Association appointed a commission to study tuberculosis hookworm disease and pellagra among the Negroes These reports though incomplete furnished one of the interesting features of the last meeting of the association A few illustrations may be mentioned In I908 the Bay State Medical Society of Boston Mass began a series of public meet ings The first meeting was held Sunday February 3 the general subject of Hygiene being discussed under the following heads Oral Hygiene Personal Hygiene and Practical Hygiene In March the general subject of Water was discussed as follows Contamination of Water Purification of Water Medicinal Uses of Water In April Milk was the general subject and was discussed as follows Human Milk and Its Advantages Con tamination of Milk Infant Feeding In May the general sub ject of Tuberculosis was discussed as follows First Past Present and Future of Tuberculosis second Channels of Infec tion and Early Symptoms third Efforts Being Made to Control the Disease These meetings were all well attended and evinced a surpris ing amount of interest on the part of the people in all walks of life Since that season the society has held many similar meetings in all the colored churches of the city Similar meetings have been held by the North Jersey Medical Society It is the policy of this society to hold four of these meetings each year At the last meeting of the Louisiana Medical Dental and Pharmaceutical Association one hundred dollars was appropriated by the society as a nucleus for the establishment of a tuberculosis hospital for the treatment of Negro patients A committee has been appointed to formulate plans and secure a location An Anti 355 IIIThle Annals of the Americani Academy Tuberculosis League has been established by Negro physicians of Louisiana Lectures on hygiene sanitation and tuberculosis are delivered by Negro physicians to schools associations and summer normals A public health car has been put into service by the Louisiana State Board of Health which is admirably equipped for the purpose of traveling through the state stopping at various towns and cities where lectures are delivered on hygiene and sani tation The Alabama Medical Dental and Pharmaceutical Associa tion has for a number of years devoted especial attention to topics pertaining to the health and sanitary conditions of the people At its meeting in Selma in I909 one evening session was devoted to the subject of tuberculosis in one of the largest churches in the city which was packed with an interested and appreciative audience The Lone Star Medical Dental and Pharmaceutical Associa tion of Texas holds annual meetings and aside from the purely professional aspects of these gatherings especial attention is paid to health topics The MedicoChirurgical Society of New York for the past year has been teaching the people by means of lectures in the dif ferent churches etc The MedicoChirurgical Society of the District of Columbia with a membership of seventy or eighty devotes much of its atten tion to topics pertaining to the public health An antituberculosis league has been formed in the city of Washington with a member ship of about 2000 In addition to what the Negro physicians are doing in an organized way a tremendous amount of worka great deal of it unheard of outside of their immediate communitiesis being done by individual physicians Without doubt the Negro physician is one of the most potent forces for the uplift of the race and there seems to be a growing realization on his part of what his great responsibilities are in this regard The great volume of his work is done in private in his office consultations on his daily rounds in the churches the secret orders the Sunday schools the Y M C As and in a great many other gatherings he uses his influence for the betterment of racial conditions and at the same time for the good of the public for it cannot be denied that whatever may 356 112Health Problems of the Negroes be done for the uplift of the Negro as a race at the same time helps the general public As an instance of the above I might cite a few examples Dr A A Wyche a Negro physician practicing in the city of Charlotte N C was impressed with how little our young men knew about caring for their general health and to that end began a course of Sunday afternoon lectures to boys and young men on different subjects pertaining to their welfare He said It was surprising to know the good these talks have done So many have come to me privately and expressed how much they have been helped by them He is now preparing a series of lectures to be given to the young women He is also giving lectures once a week to trained nurses to the Ministers Union and the graded school teachers upon hygiene and other medical subjects At Atlanta the Fairhaven Infirmary is operated by six Negro physicians and is doing great service in offering shelter at very rea sonable rates The nurses from the nurse training department of Morris Brown College are sent out to do charity work under the direction of physicians and in that way carry relief to the homes of many who really need the care of a nurse but could not pay for such services Dr R F Boyd of Nashville Tenn writes I have been deeply interested in this subject for a number of years I am at present president of the Antituberculosis League of Nashville which holds bimonthly meetings in the various churches instruct ing the people as to the origin prevention and cure of The Great White Plague We have a committee that distributes sputum cups to those who are subject to the disease The antispitting law has been so thoroughly taught that now most of the people obey it almost implicitly and the amount of spitting on the floors cars and sidewalks is very much reduced Since we began this cam paign many of our people are living in better houses wear better clothes and are more careful about the selection and preparation of their food The churches school houses and public buildings are better ventilated and the mortality is lessened In Lexington the local Negro medical society frequently gives lectures on health topics to help educate the people in the prevention as well as treatment of disease and special effort is made to decrease the mortality from tuberculosis 357 I 13The Annals of the American Academy Some of the Negro insurance companies are alive to the issue and are taking steps to benefit the health and prolong the lives of their policy holders The North Carolina Mutual and Provident Association of Durham N C through Dr A M Moore its medical director advises that The most potent method is the bed side instruction given by agents and superintendents while paying sick claims This comes at a time when one is more inclined to receive instruction Through our annual agents conference I give a daily lecture on sanitation contagions and preventable diseases and explain the danger of flies and water supply as well as buying secondhand bedding carpets or clothes moving into houses in which contagious sickness has been prior especially tuberculosis cases We try to make every agent a sanitary officer We issue a quarterly bulletin which is an advertising chart one page of which is devoted to Sanitation and Health Hints I have succeeded in having several district physicians socie ties organized which meet in different cities holding public meet ings on sanitation hygiene and contagious diseases We are con stantly urging the agents by circular letters and talks to strive in every way to better the condition of the people in as many ways as possible The Union Mutual Aid Association of Mobile Ala distrib utes through its agents from time to time helpful literature Health talks are given to the agents by physicians The agents are required as cause and opportunity present to speak to the policy holders on improving their sanitary surroundings The Union Mutual Aid Association is inaugurating this year the plan of giving small sums of money to the health department of a number of municipalities of the state to be applied to sanitary improvement It is not expected that the fund presented will accomplish very much but it will help to wake the colored people up to the fact that some of the more thoughtful of the race are alive to the necessity of making tangible effort along this line The company is planning at some time in the future to give one yearly medical examination to its policy holders at any time the policy holder in good standing may elect to take the same The Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute Hampton Va is doing good work at its annual conferences by bringing together race leaders and teachers physicians etc and among other 358 114Health Problems of the Negroes subjects discussing the health conditions among the Negroes At the I909 conference the Antituberculosis League of Virginia was organized In Elizabeth City county they are trying to teach the people that consumption is curable if taken in hand in time and to apply to an intelligent physician for treatment instead of going to the druggist or taking patent medicines Great efforts are being made in Norfolk to prevent the spread of consumption Some four years ago the Antituberculosis League opened a free clinic for the treatment of consumption three days in the week being devoted to colored patients and for the year ending September 30 I909 sixtyfour colored patients were treated at this clinic These patients were supplied with sputum cups medicine and printed instructions as to how to take care of them selves and protect themselves from infection thus aiding in their own cure and protecting others from becoming victims of the dis ease In October I909 a tuberculosis clinic was opened in the city of Norfolk for the colored people with a trained nurse in charge and seven colored physicians on the clinic staff in charge of the work The city paid the salary of the nurses and expenses of the clinic the physicians volunteered their services From Octo ber I I909 to June I I9IO one hundred and three patients were treated at this clinic The nurse was required to follow up the patients who attended the clinics and give them instructions in their houses One thousand six hundred and eightyfive such visits were made during the past year An Antituberculosis League was organized in Portsmouth Va April 30 I909 On October I9 I909 the Richmond branch of the colored Antituberculosis League was organized This league has held a series of public meetings at churches The third Sunday in January I910 was observed as tuberculosis day A sermon on tuberculosis was preached in nearly every colored church in Rich mond and literature bearing on the subject was distributed The visiting committee of the league with Miss Mary F Clark a reg istered nurse as chairman did very important work by affiliating with the city health authorities in hunting up tubercular patients and providing proper treatment The committee divided the city into districts and nurses were assigned to each district Food clothing medicine and even fuel have been furnished for the sick Persons have been taught how to care for the sick and how to 359 115The Annals of the Amcricalt Academy clean and care for their houses and in some instances cooking lessons were given and in many other ways this committee has helped along the work The membership of the league is about four hundred Another element in the work of improving the healths of the Negroes is the rise of the Negro hospitals Dr George W Hub bard dean of Meharry Medical College reports that the graduates of Meharry own and control six institutions of this kind in Tennes see two in Oklahoma five in Texas and one each in Missouri Colorado and Georgia These hospitals and sanatoriums have been well patronized and have proven financially successful and have done much to prevent the sufferings of the colored people Space will not permit me to do more than barely mention the names of a great many others which are either owned or controlled by Negroes Provident Hospital Chicago Freedmans Hospital Washington The Frederick Douglass Memorial Hospital Philadelphia The Ply mouth Hospital in Boston the Provident Hospital in St Louis the Provident Hospital in Baltimore Md the Mercy Hospital Phila delphia the Richmond Hospital and the Womans Central League Hospital in Richmond Va the Lincoln Hospital at Durham N C the St Agnes Hospital and the Shaw University Hospital at Raleigh the Hospital and Nurse Training School at Charleston S C the Charity Hospital at Savannah Ga the McVicar Hos pital at Spellman Seminary Atlanta the Fairhaven Infirmary Atlanta the Lamar Hospital Augusta the Burrus Sanatorium Augusta the Tuskegee Institute Hospital Tuskagee Institute Ala the Hale Infirmary Montgomery the Northcross Sanatorium Montgomery the Cottage Home Infirmary Decatur the Old Folks Home and Hospital Birmingham the Burwell Sanitarium Selma the Harris Infirmary Mobile the Kenniebrew Sanatorium in Jack sonville 11 the Red Cross Sanatorium Louisville Ky the Burt Sanatorium Clarksville Tenn and the Perry Sanatorium Kansas City Mo Along with the establishment of Negro hospitals have arisen the nurses training schools Most of the hospitals mentioned above have connected with them such schools which are sending out from Year to year a large number of colored women who are not only getting ready employment among the white people but are 36o ii6Health Problems of the Negroes taking their share of the burden of spreading the gospel of good health and right living among Negroes The Associated Charities of Birmingham Ala employs a col ored nurse to do settlement work and furnishes medical attention without charge where needed Under the supervision of the Visiting Nurses Association of Chicago there are four of the graduate nurses of Provident Hos pital working among the Negroes also one graduate of this hospital is a member of the school nurses force Her work is in the school where a large per cent of the pupils are Negroes In all proba bility in the near future another Negro nurse will be added to the tuberculosis nurse force A tuberculosis dispensary is about to be established in connection with Provident Hospital From the third annual report of the Chicago Tuberculosis Institute 1908 we quote Early in February a mass meeting of colored people was held in Fulton Hall The result of this meet ing was the formation of a strong Negro committee which has done active work during the year and among other things arranged for a dozen or more Sunday services at the different colored churches in the city with sermons on tuberculosis Dr Anna R Cooper a colored physician is the leader of a movement to establish the Paul Lawrence Dunbar Sanitarium for the treatment of tuberculosis among Negroes Governor Hadley of Missouri has recently appointed an important tuberculosis com mission The object of the commission is to find out just what the sanitary conditions are among the Negroes The Municipal Health Leagues were recently formed by both the white and colored people of Raleigh N C At Asheville N C in both colored and white schools the modern health drinking faucets have been established and other improvements in sanitation have been installed Much is being done to improve the conditions in Savannah Ga The Mens Sunday Club colored of that city was organized in I905 It has had an average attendance since organization of two hundred people About every colored physician in the city has spoken before the club In the summer of I905 a regular cam paign for health improvement was carried on All the colored churches were visited and addresses made at each one by physicians 36I I 17The Annals of the American Academy and others Mothers clubs were organized especially to assist in improving health conditions The colored Knights of Pythias are helping to restore to health a great many people by having established in I908 at Hot Springs Ark a bath house and sanitarium where thousands of colored people have gone and received benefit by the scientific appli cation of the waters The Tuskegee Institute has been alive to this movement and in numerous ways has attempted to improve conditions in the school in the surrounding communities and in other places Several forces have cooperated along this line The American tuberculosis exhibition under the direction of Mr E G Routzahn paid a visit to the Institute in December I908 remaining several days giving stereopticon lectures health talks as well as displaying the exhibit to thousands of visitors including those connected with the school the town of Tuskegee and the surrounding community At the same time a Tuberculosis Con gress was held where important subjects concerning tuberculosis and the health of the Negro were discussed At the annual Negro conference of I909 the subject General Health Conditions of Negroes in the Southern States was dis cussed under the following headings How the ministers can assist in bringing about better health conditions What the teacher can do to improve our health con ditions How the doctor can assist in improving our general health conditions Food and its relations to health The late Dr S P Lloyd of Savannah Ga led the discussion with a paper on health conditions from the physicians standpoint He gave as the general causes of the high death rate among the Negroes poor housing conditions bad landlords dissipation ignor ance He advocated improving these conditions by general educa tion by public instruction through the newspapers physicians and ministers that the municipalities ought to see that better houses are built for the Negroes He also advocated the systematic and perma nent cooperation of the Negroes themselves Bishop Alstork told how the church could help During the discussion individual communion cups were advocated also that lodges should hold shorter sessions that churches should not be swept out Sunday mornings just before services 362 II8Health Problems of the Negroes The Tuskegee Institute has also assisted in this work by the publication of bulletins of health under the direction of the resi dent physician These topics have included Tuberculosis Ty phoid Fever The Danger of Flies an dother topics along sani tary lines Stereopticon lectures on tuberculosis general sanitation and the hookworm disease have been given and other health talks to students and teachers in the school also to the Macon County Farmers Institute the Macon County Teachers Institute and to some of the Negro churches Four years ago in connection with the hospital there was in augurated among the women what is known as the Hospital Aid Society composed of an advisory board of ten women and members at large from the school and community This society has done a great deal to help improve conditions at the Institute Hospital to make patients and nurses more comfortable to visit the sick in the community in many instances furnishing medical attention and nurses services as well as nourishment and medicine for those too poor to pay for these necessities It also maintains a charity room and bed at the Institute Hospital in which suitable indigent patients are taken for operative and other treatment free of charge At the last general meeting of this society it was interesting to hear some of these poor patients tell with gratitude how they have been helped Quite recently all of the school children attending the childrens house about two hundred were examined by the resident physician and his assistants A great many defects were found parents were advised of the same and directed to physicians dentists and special ists as the condition required in order that the defects might be remedied The colored womens clubs are working to improve the homes through reading circles by teaching domestic science and by other means Some of the clubs are conducting homes for aged men and women and for boys and girls The Boys Reformatory at Mount Meigs Ala where thirtyseven boys and two men are cared for on land that cost five hundred dollars with a building costing twelve hundred dollars is an example The Womens Club of Tuskegee Institute is especially active Houses are visited with a view to teaching the people the simple principles of hygiene The smallest details are looked after as how 363 II9The Annals of the American Academy to prepare and serve their food how and when to bathe how to ven tilate their houses how to care for their hair the washing of their clothing cleaning their teeth sleeping between sheets and all such subjects as tend to improve their home conditions The special sub jects of tuberculosis and typhoid fever have been discussed before the people in the most elementary manner possible Mrs Booker T Washington says The people themselves are most responsive and cooperative and that as a result of the work which has been done along these lines great improvements have been made 364 120

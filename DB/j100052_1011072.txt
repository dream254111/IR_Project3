J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1011072,HEALTH PROBLEMS OF THE NEGROES,I242615,HEALTH PROBLEMS OF THE NEGROES BY JOHN A KENNEY MD TUSKEGEE INSTITUTE ALA IT IS GRATIFYING TO STATE THAT THE NEGROES ARE BECOMING VERY ACTIVE IN THE CRUSADE AGAINST PREVENTABLE DISEASES IN MANY PLACES WITHOUT QUIBBLING OVER SUCH ACADEMIC QUESTIONS AS WHETHER THE NEGRO IS DYING AS RAPIDLY AS SOME OTHER PEOPLE OR WHETHER THERE IS SOME RACIAL INHERENCY PRODUCTIVE OF ITS HIGH MORTALITY OR WHETHER IT IS DUE TO ENVIRONMENT THE RACE IS REALIZING THAT ITS DEATH RATE IS HIGH THAT CERTAIN DISEASES ARE TAKING MORE THAN THEIR FAIR TOLL OF HUMAN LIFE FROM ITS RANKS AND THAT MANY OF THESE DISEASES ARE PREVENTABLE WITH THIS REALIZATION MANY NEGROES HAVE SET TO WORK TO IMPROVE THEIR LIVING CONDITIONS AND REDUCE MORTALITY AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED THE MEDICAL PROFESSION WAS AMONG THE FIRST TO REALIZE THIS AND TO SEEK FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THE YEAR I895 THE NATIONAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION COMPOSED OF REPRESENTATIVE NEGROES IN THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE DENTISTRY AND PHARMACY WAS ORGANIZED IN THE CITY OF ATLANTA WITH THE OBJECT OF IMPROVING THE CONDITIONS OF NEGRO PROFESSIONAL MEN AND THROUGH THEM HELPING TO EDUCATE THE MASSES ALONG THE LINE OF BETTER HEALTH AND RIGHT LIVING THE INFLUENCE OF THIS ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN FELT IN MOST OF THE COUNTRY EAST OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER FROM BOSTON IN THE NORTH TO ATLANTA IN THE SOUTH AT ITS ANNUAL SESSIONS ONE OF THE CHIEF FEATURES HAS BEEN AT LEAST ONE PUBLIC SESSION FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PEOPLE WHEN SUBJECTS OF POPULAR INTEREST ARE DISCUSSED IN SIMPLE LANGUAGE AMONG THE TOPICS THUS PRESENTED ARE THE FOLLOWING THE CAUSE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF TUBERCULOSIS INFANT MORTALITY THE PROPER CARE AND FEEDING OF INFANTS ETC THAT THESE DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN APPRECIATED BY THE LAITY IS ATTESTED BY THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN GIVEN IN CROWDED HALLS AND WE HAVE EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE DONE GOOD BEFORE THE ORGANIZATION OF THE NATIONAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION THERE WERE IN EXISTENCE FEW STATE AND LOCAL MEDICAL SOCIETIES AMONG 354HEALTH PROBLEMS OF THE TEGROES THE NEGROES MOST OF THOSE THAT WERE IN EXISTENCE HAVE AFFILIATED WITH THE NATIONAL AND A GREAT MANY OTHERS HAVE BEEN ORGANIZED UNDER ITS INFLUENCE AT THE PRESENT TIME NEARLY EVERY STATE HAVING A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF NEGRO PHYSICIANS HAS ITS MEDICAL SOCIETY AND ASIDE FROM THIS NEARLY ALL THE CITIES AND MANY OF THE LARGE TOWNS ALSO HAVE LOCAL SOCIETIES AND ALMOST WITHOUT EXCEPTION TO A VARIABLE DEGREE THEY ARE STRIVING TO HELP THE NEGRO PEOPLE ATTAIN TO HIGHER PLANES OF LIVING AND THUS IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH AND REDUCE THEIR DEATH RATE EARLY IN THE YEAR I9I0 THE EXECUTIVE BOARD OF THE NATIONAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION APPOINTED A COMMISSION TO STUDY TUBERCULOSIS HOOKWORM DISEASE AND PELLAGRA AMONG THE NEGROES THESE REPORTS THOUGH INCOMPLETE FURNISHED ONE OF THE INTERESTING FEATURES OF THE LAST MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION A FEW ILLUSTRATIONS

WHAT THE NEGRO PHYSICIANS ARE DOING IN AN ORGANIZED WAY A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORKA GREAT DEAL OF IT UNHEARD OF OUTSIDE OF THEIR IMMEDIATE COMMUNITIESIS BEING DONE BY INDIVIDUAL PHYSICIANS WITHOUT DOUBT THE NEGRO PHYSICIAN IS ONE OF THE MOST POTENT FORCES FOR THE UPLIFT OF THE RACE AND THERE SEEMS TO BE A GROWING REALIZATION ON HIS PART OF WHAT HIS GREAT RESPONSIBILITIES ARE IN THIS REGARD THE GREAT VOLUME OF HIS WORK IS DONE IN PRIVATE IN HIS OFFICE CONSULTATIONS ON HIS DAILY ROUNDS IN THE CHURCHES THE SECRET ORDERS THE SUNDAY SCHOOLS THE Y M C AS AND IN A GREAT MANY OTHER GATHERINGS HE USES HIS INFLUENCE FOR THE BETTERMENT OF RACIAL CONDITIONS AND AT THE SAME TIME FOR THE GOOD OF THE PUBLIC FOR IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT WHATEVER MAY 356 112HEALTH PROBLEMS OF THE NEGROES BE DONE FOR THE UPLIFT OF THE NEGRO AS A RACE AT THE SAME TIME HELPS THE GENERAL PUBLIC AS AN INSTANCE OF THE ABOVE I MIGHT CITE A FEW EXAMPLES DR A A WYCHE A NEGRO PHYSICIAN PRACTICING IN THE CITY OF CHARLOTTE N

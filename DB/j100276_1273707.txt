530 Sharkey v McDermott 9I iMo 647 4 S W Rep Io7 Schutt v Miss Society 4I N J Eq II5 In the principal case the court seems inclined to think that equity may enforce the contract even though nothing but personal property is involved and argues that as there are no other creditors it would be a useless and senseless proceeding to require him the defendant to pass this property over to the administrator with one hand and award him the right which the law will not deny to take it back with the other Such a course is doubtless more convenient here but clearly the authority is against allowing specific performance when the remedy at law is adequate POMEROYS EQ JURIS 3rd Ed Vol 4  I40I If such specific performance would not be granted the defendant has no right to retain the property but should file his claim and have it allowed by the Pro bate Court in the regular way CORPORATIONSBANKS AND BANKINGNEGLIGENCE OF DIRECTORSLIABIL ITY FOR DECEITLIABILITY TO CREDITORSPlaintiff surety on the bond of the State Bank of N given to indemnify against loss of funds deposited with it sues the directors of the bank to recover the sums he was compelled to pay the depositor on the insolvency of the corporation alleging that they had kept the bank open for business and received deposits although they knew that it was then insolvent Held that the defendants are not liable Hart v Evan son I905  N Dak  I05 N W Rep 942 The theory of the decision is that the allegations and proof merely show gross neglect by the defendant the only director who appealed of his duties as a director and no attempt on his part to have the bank discontinue busi ness because of insolvency and as such duties on the one hand were owed by him only to the bank and not to its creditors and as the act of keeping open the bank on the other hand was not his individual act but the act of the whole board of directors the plaintiff has shown no cause of action either for negligence or deceit The doctrine adopted by many of the courts is that the creditors cannot maintain an action against the directors in their own right for mismanagement or neglect of corporate affairs resulting in loss of corporate assets as such liability is the result of an obligation owing only to the corporation whose agents they are Landis v Sea Isle Hotel Co 31 Atl 755 affirmed 53 N J Eq 654 Wilson v Stevens I29 Ala 630 29

Rep 725 24 S E 478 Under circumstances similar to those in the principal case the directors were held liable to a depositor in Cassidy v Uhlmann I70 N Y 505 63 N E 554 where the court overruled the defense that the act of keeping the doors open after known insolvency was not the act of the individual directors holding that the directors should as a last resort make public announcement of the insolvency which is in direct conflict with the statement of ENGERUD J in the case under discussion that the defendant owed no legal duty to personally denounce the bank See also Solomon v Bates supra

noted between actions to enforce a liability for injuries to corporate assets which must be brought directly by the corporation or another for it and actions to enforce a liability for in juries resulting directly to strangers without affecting the corporate property at all i e torts on third parties Most of the cases cited in the principal case to support the decision belong to the former class whereas the ground of recovery so far as deceit was relied on was based on a tort directly upon the plaintiff See Salmon v Richardson 30 Conn 360 79 Am Dec 255 Cross v Sackett 2 BOSWORTH N Y 645

another corporation to issue to the latter for services to be rendered a certain amount of bonds convertible into stock at the option of the holders at any time within five years Complain ant a stockholder in the defendent corporation sues to restrain the issuance of the bonds on the ground that the proposed action will deprive him of the right to participate in the issue of new stock which the conversion of the bonds will necessitate to an extent measured by the comparative amount of his present holdings and upon the same terms that other parties partici pate therein Held that the

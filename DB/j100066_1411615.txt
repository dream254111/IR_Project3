IV APRIL 1892 NO 3 THE A1MERICAN clOIJRNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY ON DERT A IN PECUTITA RITIES oF TEE KNEEJERK IN STIPFJP IN A CASE OF TERMINAL DEMENTIA FROM THE LABORATORY OF TEE MGLEAN ASYLUM SOMERV1LLE MASS BY WILLIAM NOYES M D Assistant Physician and Pathologist In the more precise investigations of the physiological con ditions modifying the kneejerk a11 investigators have found that the mental condition of the normal subject entered largely as a disturbing factor the diflerent emotional states and the sarying conditions of the nervous system invalidating the result to a certain extent or at least rendering necessary an enormous number of observations before the  normal  knee jerk for any individual could be obtained Emotional states being almost completely absent in cases of advanced dementia it was thought that an investigation of the kneejerk in this state might yield some results on the conditions modifying it An excellent subject was found in an elderly man ad mitted to the asylum in 1841 and with the exception of the seven years preceding 1850 having spent this whole period at the McLean A sylum Tn 1843 it is stated that his 4 mental faculties are mostly gone never makes an inquiry spends his time in wandering about the yard slovenly in his dress and but little or nothing could be added concerning his mental condition at the present time I3is dementia is complete he having absolutely no knowledge of his surroundings not even know ing his name is unable to answer questions relevantly his talk being utterly incoherent iEIe is good natured and docile and has never made the slightest objection to the experiments which almost always mean an estra nap for him In fact hewill go to sleep in almost any position in which he is placed and remains perfectly quiet and contented Several demented men were tried but with the esception of this one they a11 proved resistive or restless and were given up one after another The patient finally selected was a peculiarly good one for a prolonged series of tests on the condition of his nervous system as he was subjeet to periods of depression and exhiliration such as not infrequently occur in chronic dements and a record was made of a11 his bodily functions pulse temperature weight blood pressure so far as this could be measured mental condition and finally kneejerk in the hope of finding some change in his bodily condition coincident with the change in his mental state IJnfortunately from the point of view of gaining any information on this particular point after passing through one cycle of exhilira tion and depression he settled down into a state of compar atively even mental and physical life and as the obser vations taken during this cycle would need further con firmation no mention will here be made of them The original problem also the theoretically lesser variability of the kneejerk in a demented person gradually changed into another as will appear subsequently and the present paper will be confined to a consideration of two important points that came out in the course of the investigation Apparcttus and Method of Experimentation After a trial of diflerent hammers that of Lombard1 Wa finally adopted that of Prof Bowditch2 which was kindly loaned for an experimental trial not proving strong enough for this patient in whom a ratner heavy blow was necessary The hammer was of cast iron the handle being an iron rod 20 cm long on the end of which a similar piece of iron rod 4 cm long was fastened horizontalAy serving as an aris and supported in an iron frame work An inder on the handle moved over a graduated scale so that by raising the hammer any given number of degrees the same strength of blow Wa given Throughout the experiments the hammer always fell 45 except in a few instlees where the strength of the blow was changed for a short time for some special purpose The hammer was supported by horizontal rods and clamps to a piece of gaspipe serving as an upright support fastened to a firm wooden base that could be securely clamped to the table The arrangement combined firmness and strength while at the same time the hammer could be quickly raised or lowered

the scale when the patients leg was put in position When pulled back into position to strike the blow the hammer was held by a large electromagnet the support of which was also adjustable The hammer was pulled back by a cord and released by a simple circuit breaking key The blows were always given at 5 seconds intervals except that the interlTal was occasionally changed for special purposes but in the reports of the experiments 5 second intervals are always to be understood unless other wise distinctly stated The patient reclined on his right side on a mattress placed on a table with a firm support extend ing the length of his back The left knee was supported on a wooden arm extending from a wooden upright that was firmly clanlped to the table and the left foot was supported in a stirrup hanging from the ceiling allowing free movement of the leg Attached to the stirrup at the point on which the heel rested was a steel rod 3 feet long passing backwards and supported on pulleys on its further end was fastened a thread passing over pulleys and attached to a short vertical steel rod moving up and down through two brass supports and suspended from above by a light spring A cork placed on the rod carried on its side the writing point a piece of light stiff celluloid which pressed lightly against the dram of a Baltzar Eymograph When the blow was struck the foot Xnoved forward pulling the steel rod with it and this by its thread attachment pulled down the writing point leaving the record of the full length of the kick on the smoked sur face of the paper There was of course always a slight back ward kick which appears in the records above the horizontal line made by the drum revolving under the writing point when this was at rest Disappearance of the KneeJerAc n Sleep and the Eyect of Audttory Stitnulz The disappearance of the kneejerk in sleep has been previously observed 1 Its complete disappearance was early noticed in our patient and this is therefore no departure from the normal A s would naturally be expected the patient went to sleep much more easily than a person with an active mind and it was thus possible to observe the phenomena a large number of times The behaviour of the kneejerk when sensory stimuli are received by the patient during this period of sleep appears Bowditch and Warren loc cit p 59 Lombard loc cit p 53 PT NTT T T A T TATT a n TM TTT TTT

produce a decided tendency to sleep in the individual experimented on To counteract this tendency and to insure a certain degree of attention to the phenomena the subject of the experiment was required to declare after each kneejerk whether or not a lJendrassik BeitrEge zur Lehre von den Sehnen reflesen Deutsches Arch f Klin lbled lS83 x x x I 1I 177 21Zedical Neos Feb 13 and 20 1886 3Loc

In spite of this precaution the tendency to sleep was sometimes quite irresistible and in eight or nine cases the experiment was continued after the subject had yielded to it and was sleeping soundly It was thetl found that the knee jerks both normal and reinforced grew gradually smaller and when sleep was profound disappeared entirely the blow upon the knee being absolutely without effect This result is nof what might have been espected from our knowledge of the effect of sleep on the ordinary cutaneous refieses e g that produced by tickling the sole of the foot Whether this can be regarded as an argument against the refles character of the kneejerk or whether we have here an essential differ ence between deep and superficial refieses are questions to be decided by future investigations  Prof Lombard has kindly gone over with me his own curves made in 1887 in New York generally on healthy medical students and many of these show an absolute dis appearance of the kneejerk in sleep and they also show a sudden rise from O from some accidental stimulus such as the entrance of a person into the laboratory but this effect lasted over but a few kicks In our demented patient when the kneejerk has entirely disappeared in sleep an auditory stimulus causes an increase in the length of the kick and this increase is visible over a lollg series of jerks This latter phenomenon is apparently a departure from the normal and a peculiarity of this subject This in well shown in Fig 1 The patient was asleep from the beginning of the esperiment and soundly asleep with total disappearance of the kneejerk during the minute and three quarters preceding the time when two light taps were given on the table with the wooden handle of the needle that was being used by the observer to make records on the drum The lineejerk rose from O to 95 mm in 5 seconds rose to 395 mm in the nest 5 seconds to 59 mm then fell to 38 mm through the 29 succeeding kicks gradually fell with slight fluctuations to 65 mm remained at practically this length for 3 kicks rose to 15 mm and then to 28 mm fell to 16 mm and 14 mm then came 5 kicks averaging 66 mm then came a rise without apparent cause to 44 mm then followed a fall to O after fluctuations estending over 27 kicks Thus one auditory stimulus had an apparent effect extending over 72 kicks occupying 6 minutes During this whole time the subject was sleeping soundly being apparently as sound asleep as when the auditory stimulus was first given Five kicks of the value of O then followed and there then348 NOYES came on another series of increased kicks with no apparent cause lasting over 16 kicks with another total disappearance There then followed 28 kicks with almost total disappearance of the kneejerk and then two taps B brought out the series of reinforced kicks again with a peculiar series of groups of kicks estending to near the end of the experiment with occa sional total disappearances Toward the end C two taps produced almost no eiiect causing a rise only to 10 mm from a preceding 7 then followed 18 105 4 and 0 After three of 0 value another lengthened group came on with no ap parent cause and at this point the subject was awakened by being spoken to It was noted that this day he was decidedly more dull than on the day before that he slept from the beginning to the time he was awakened and that all efforts to rouse him at this point amounted to but little as he would simply mutter a little and then drop oii to sleep again There were no accidental sensory reinforcements that were sufficient ly noticeable to he brought to the consciousness of the ob server who was on the watch to note them The peculiar set of groups  of kicks occurring during the course of this esperiment will be discussed later on This prolonged effect of a sensory stimulus is seen again in Fig 2 where two clicks were given on a telegraph sounder at A after the knee j erk had entirely disappeared  Here the kick rose from 0 to 18 mm and then to 42 and 44 falling through 17 kicks to 3 mm not reaching 0 again for 17 more kicks There were three kicks of the value of 0 a short rise over 4 kicks a total disappearance during 2 more the needle not even making a dot on the line and then there came another of the  groups B with no apparent esciting stimulus lasting over 10 kicks before these entirely disappeared again There were slight rises above the 0 line and at C a noise on the floor below caused another series of reinforced jerks and the subject awoke Practically this same eiiect of stimuli is seen in Fig 3 where at A and B walking on the loor below caused the rises there shown the much lesser eflect of the second stimulus is seen in the fewer number of kicks that were caused by it Blows were delivered at the regular 5 second intervals although without the eflect of moving the needle from the straight line until at C two taps with the needlehandle and a distant locomotive whistle a little later caused ths3 prolonged series of increaseds kicks that followed EIere again it must be rememberea that to all outward appearances the patient was sleeping as soundly as when the sensory stimuli were received Fig 4 shows the same effect once more the kneejerk having entirely disappeared during the period represented by the straight349 PECULIARITIES 0E THE ENEEJERK line preceding A blows being struck at the regular 5 seconds intervals while at A a passing barrow caused a slight rise and at B the noise of a passing cart caused a much greater rise with a secondary rise a little later with another rise before the kneejerk entirely reached O again and then after three kicks of the value of O there was still another rise when there was again total disappearance In Fig 5 the eiiect is shown of giving the rappingstimulus seven times in succession The largest effect was after the second time where the reinforcement continued over 13 kicks before the zero point was reached After the third stimulus there were 8 reinforced jerks before the kicks sank again not to 0 but to 4 mm Stimulus no 4 called out only two reinforced kicks no 5 called out 2 no 6 4 and no 7 6 At no 8 the patient was awakened These would seem to show that the subject had gradually become accustomed to the stimulus and thus its effect was lessened If it is argued that the patient was more wakeful at 6 and 7 as shown by the fact that the kicks did not return to 0 this would mean also that stimuli did not have so great an effect during this more wakeful condition as during the condition of deeper sleep This diminution of the eflect of a reinforcing stimulus is shown in Fig 6 where 2 clicks were given on a telegraph sounder at 1 causing a marked effect lasting through 6 kicks and then disappeared to be followed by a secondary rise during 7 kicks and then a total disap pearance A repetition of the clicks however at 2 was followed by no response for the first kick but the second and third kicks rose respectively to 1 and 2 mm which ordin arily would be accounted for by the jarring of the apparatus but in this particular instance there had been no movement even from the jarring so it seems fair to attribute these two move ments of the writing needle slight as they are to the knee jerk A third repetition of the stimulus 3 called out a kneejerk of 3 mm followed by a total disappearance during 5 kicks then a kick of 8 mm with no apparent preceding stimulus a disappearance of three kicks and then a repetition of the clicks this time three clicks instead of two produced a kick of 8 mm with another total disappearance A repetition of the three clicks 5 caused no response for the first kick but the second rose to 26 mm the third to 43 and from this time on there was no disappearance but a kick followed every blow of the hammer Attempts to find a similarly marked reinforcement from auditory stimuli while the patient was awake did not meet with as good results as while he was asleep Fig 7 shows a portion of a curve taken from the middle of a tracing while350 NOYES the subject was fully awake At the places indicated by dots two clicks were given on the telegraph sounder and an apparent reinforcement appears at times and again an appar ent inhibition This disagreement may be due to the fact that the interval of time by which the sound preceded the blow was not measured so that the blows may have been struck at the re inforcing interval at one time and at the inhibiting interval at another The irregularities in the kicks during the period that the reinforcing signals were being given are no greater than the irregularities in the kicks preceding and following the rein forcing signals The sounds both inside and outside the labor atory that had so much eflect during sleep never appeared to have a corresponding eflect when the subject was awake To have settled this point definitely would have necessitated a repetition of the elaborate experiments of Bowditch and Warren Nor was the interval by which the sound preceded the blow in sleep measured it probably usually varied between one and two seconds As the peculiar prolongation of the reinforcement made its appearance apparently irrespect ive of the interval by which the soullel preceded particular attention was nof given to this point It would be interest ing to determine if an interval could be found at which the stimulus would inhibit such a prolonged series of kicks as shown in some of the curves On several occasions the first kick after an auditory stimulus did not rise as high as the second as shown in Fig 3 and this raises the question whether the inhibiting interval may not have accidentally been struck here but the effect of the inhibition passing ofl during the succeed ing 5 seconds the stimulus exerted its full force and the kick rose to the maximum Should this be so it would seem to point to the necessity in measuring the interval by which the blow must be preceded by the sensory stimulus to pro duce inhibition or reinforcement of following the first blow by several Illore at comparatively short intervals With regard to sensory stimuli that reached this patient during the time he was awake it can only be stated that these appeared to have a very slight and triflinz eidect compared with those that reached him during sleep It should be added that previous observers of the disap pearance of the kneejerk in sleep and of its rise in this con dition in response to e2terna1 stimuli have not delin7ered the blows at the same intervals as in these e2mperiments conse quently it is possible that some of the effects of the stimuli may not have been ecorded in their tracings A ttempts were made to settle this point by experiments on normal indi viduals but the kneejerk did not entirely disappear in sleep in the trials that were made In Fig 12 there is shown aPECULIARITIES OF TEE ENEEJERE 351 portion of one of these tracings from one of the medical house pupils The experiment was begun at 1010 p m and con tinued until 1115 p m The portion shown is from about the middle of the tracing after the subject had become thoroughly drowsy and a grdual diminuation of the length of the kicks is seen as the experiment progressed When it be came probable that the kneejerk would not completely disap pear the customary auditory stimuli two taps with the needle handle were given at 1 2 3 and 4 Although there was a response in each case the eflect of the stimuli estended over a much shorter period than in the demented patient Beginning witlh the tenth kick preceding the point at which the 6timulus was first given at 1 the length of the kicks in millimetres is given below ao 2 25 lO 74 a 35 9o 75 14 55 4 2 3 5 5o 14 2 3S 8 35 9 2 3 2 10 5

figures 1 2 3 and 4 It will be seen that the effect of the first stimulus can be traced over the three following kicks and then the kneejerk fell to 4 mm The second stimulus causet a rise from 25 mm to 15 mm but at the nest kick the kneejerk fell to 3 mm The third stimulus caused a rise from 3 mm to 7 mm and the nest kick fell to 45 mm A s the eiBect of the stimuli was evidently diminishing the fourth stimulus 4 was made much louder than the preceding ones and the kneejerk rose from 2 mm to 7 mm and then to 14 mm the succeeding three kick were 5 mm 8 mm and 2 mIn In no instance did any such prolonged eiiect fro m the stimuli occur as is shown in the tracings from the demented patient Fig 12 also shows the groups  of kicks that could not be identified with any esternal stimulus these groups are well shown before the stimuli were given by the two taps During the time that these groups appeared the subject was in the same condition of halfsleep as when the groups came out best in the demented patient352 NOYES It was possible on several oceasions to find well marked evidences of this rhythm while the subjects were fully awake Fig 11 is a tracing from the demented patient while awake and the wave like movement of the tops of the kicks is very evident As has already been stated there were suggestions of this rhythm e all through the tracings from the first of the experiments even during the waking state but in none of the other tracings during the waking condition is it as well shown as in Fig 11 This same suggestion of a rhythm is also shown in Fig 13 which is of a tracing taken from a case of well advanced general paralysis This patient was in the quiet and apathetic stage of the disease much demented with atasic gait and slow stammering speech IIe was awake during the whole experiment The same wavelike appearance of the ends of the kneejerks is well marked A tracing from still another patient is shown in Fig 14 This man was a case of dementia but not nearly so far ad vanced as the first case He was awake during the experi ment There is seen the same suggestion of the wavelike motion of the ends of the kneejerks A point not immediately connected with those already dis cussed but having a bearing on the general question is illustra ted in Fig 15 which is a portion of a tracing from the first case of dementia The subject was fully asleep as is seen from the total disappearance of the kneejerk during the first part of the tracing shown At R the hammer fell out of time inter rupting the regular 5 seconds interval and as a result of this disturhance of the regularity of the blows the kneejerk rose during the nest four kicks A t Ro the rhythm of the blows was intentionally interrupted with the result of causing a rise in the kneejerk again but this time less than at first showing that the nervous system had become accustomed to this change of rhythm At R3 the blows were delivered in as quick succes sion as possible causing a lnuch greater increase of the knee jerk than on either of the other two oceasions after eight blows given at the regular 5 seconds interval the kneejerk again sank to 0 RhytAnzic Grouping Besides showing the peculiar prolongation of the effect of a sensory stimulas Fig 1 shows also the peculiar groups  of kicks that appear in the curves with no apparent auditory stimulus to account for them One is tempted to speak of these groups as falling into a rhythm but they do not occur under circumstances justifying one absolutely in making this claim Yet looking at this curve as a whole it is difficult nofPTfTTT T A TTtllTTCS RT1 tlnlZT TZ1iTT5T5 TT 1T D U 11 1 1D 1 1  1 1X1    353 to think that there must be some rhvhmic periodical activity of the body to produce these wavelike rises and falls It will be seen that there were four of these groups before the auditory stimulus was given at X and the blows at the begin ing of the experiment appear to have begun at the top of one of these crests After the effect of the stimulus given at A had disappeared two of these groups came on before the second stimulus was given at B alld after the eifect of this had disappeared the groups continued to appear to the end of the experiment It is to be noted in this connection that the reinforcement at A came at about the time when a  group  might have been looked for and the question arises did the auditory stimullls simply intensify one of these periodical rises in the knee jerk At none of the places where these rises came on eseept at A B and C were there any reinforcing stimuli to account for them At B also the stimulus appears to have come at about the time when a rise was due while at C the stimulus seems to have come between two groups and this may account for the fact that there was a shorter effect of the stimulus here than at A and B In examining the remaining diagrams showing the prolonged effect of sensory stimuli to see if one of these  groups  may have entered as a disturbing factor the onlay instance where this could be thought to do so is in Fig 4 where the second ary rise after B maay possibly be looked on as a  group7 but the prolonged reinforcing effect of the stimulus at B is nevertheless sufficiently well marked The grouping is again well shown in Fig 8 The series is taken from the middle of a tracing after the patient was fully asleep There was an interval of seven minutes between the first kick and the preceding one and the first blows after this interval of rest naturally acted as a reinforcement but the kicks soon diminished and the peculiar wavelike movement of the curve developed There were no sensory reinforcements from sounds and the subject seemed to be in the soundest sleep The same phenomenon is seen again in Fig 9 where there were no sensory stimuli except at 1 where two taps were givenX and at a where a passillg train of cars was heard This shows also that the two taps did not invariably call out the pro longed reinforcing eHect that usually followed It was possible on some occasions to account for the changes by variations in the depth of sleep as in Fig 10 Here at the points marked A there were no auditory stimuli to account for the rises but in the intervals at the points marked B there were audible evidences of the soundness of the sleep IJsually however it was not possible to detect such a change and the waves rose and fell without any noticeable change in the regularity of the respiration354 NOYES The question as to the cause of this rhythmic t grouping of the kneejerks in sleep is a very interesting one and con siderable attention was given to it in attempting to find an explanation The phenomenon was noticed very early in the asperiments and many of the tracings made while the subject was awake suggest this same tendencs to a periodicity The grouping always shows best however in a condition that might be termed halfsleep where the subject is to all appearances sound asleep but that he is not in the profoundest sleep is shown by the fact that his knee jerk is not entirely abolished Attempts were made to find some connection between these  groups  zand the respiratory rhythm and the respiratory curve and the kneejerk curve were taken simultaneou sly but the results were entirely negative no particular length of kick being found associated with a particular phase of the respiratory curve The attempt was also made by taking a plethysmogtaphic tracing from the arm to find some connection between the depth of sleep and the variations in the kneejerk but these at first were equally unsuccessful Later it was suggested that there might possibly be some connection between the groups and the TraubeHering curves and acting on this suggestion addi tional plethysmographic tracings were taken A glass plethysmograph suspended from the ceiling to allow free movement was placed on the patients left arm and connec tion was made through a glass tube having rubber joints with a very sensitive Marey tambour the writingneedle of which was placed directly over the writingneedle of the klleejerk apparatus so that the two GurVCS were made syn chronously on the revolving cylinder of the kymograph The TraubelIering curves did not always appear and there were also many times when the peculiar groupings did not appear as it was necessary for the patient to be in the con dition of halfsleep already alluded to and alsb that there should be few or no disturbing noises The necessarsr condi tions have been fulfilled on repeated occasions however and a series of tracings obtained where there is a good TraubeHering curve and also a good series of  groups  of kneejerks A portion of one of these double curves is shown in Fig 16 The pulse beats are well marked and the res piratory rhythm is also well shown The jarring of the blow of the hammer was sufficient to set the needle of the Marey tambour violently oscillating so that the respiratory rhythm appears to be unduly accentuated but this sharp upward rise is due to the vibration of the needle The Traube Hering curve is also well marked the tops and boStoms of the waves being coImected by straight lines It will be seen that there is anPEGULIAtITTES OF THE ENEEJEPsE 355 apparent coincidence between the two curves that the Traute Hering curve descends lowest in that part of the 4 group  where the kicks are longest shd at places where the Traube Eering curve is highest the kneejerks are much diminished A rise in the TraubeIIering curve means of course increased blood pressure in the arm and a fall in the curve corresponds to diminished blood pressure On Mossos theory that in creased blood pressure in the extremities means lessened blood pressure in the central nervous system we should haveJ during the time that the TraubeEIering curve is at its height relative anaemia of the brain and cord and during the time that the TraubeEIering curve is lowest relative hyperaemia of th brain and cord There are objections to Mossos theoryt however as it fails to take into account the abdominal circu lation and the possibility that a change of blood pressure in the extremities may mean simply an opposite change in the aledominal cavity and not in the central nervous system Could we adopt Mossos view it would simplify the problem greatly to say that if we got a rise in the TraubeIIer ing curve this would mean a diminished blood supply to the brain and cord and a fall in the TraubeHering curve would mean a corresponding increase of the blood supply of the central nervous system The diminished kneejerk would then naturally foilow from the lessened functional activity of the spinal cord at the height of the peripheral TraubeHering wave while an increased knee jerk from increased functional activity of the cord would follow at the low phase of the peripheral TraubeEering curve The occurrence of the high phase of the TraubeIIering curve with a diminished kneejerk and of the low phase with an increased knee3erk has been noticed with sufficient frequency to give considerable probability to the theory that there may be a constant relation between the two The TralubeHering curves shown in Fig 16 demonstrate that there is a rhythmic rise and fall in the blood pres sure of the arm as has been freqllently proved before There is thus naturally good reason to infer that with this rise and fall occurs throughout the whole vascular system and that the vascular supply of the central nervous system is subject to this same periodicity It also seems per fectly fair to assume that this rhythm might not necessarily be the same throughout the whole vascular system of the body We only need assume that the vasomotor centre in the medulla sets up the rhythmic contractions and dilatations in the vascular system that show themselves in the periphery in the TraubeHering curves but this rhythmic influence would not necessarily propagate itself throughout the whole356 NOYES body within the same time the vascular system possessing considerable inertia and the atnount of blood to be influenced being so great Several rhythms differing in time might easily be present in the vascular supply of different portions of the body dependent on the different rates at which the vasomotor influence had propagated itself through the arterial system such rhythms should show the same gelleral characters with regard to rise and fall Fig 17 shows the result of assuming that this rhythm in the central nervous system differs a little in time from the rhythm in thc peripheral circulation In Fig 17 the TraubeHering curve shown in Fig 16 has been moved back a distance representing 20 seconds in time which would mean that the vasomotor influence affected the blood supply of the central nervous system 20 seconds before it reached the arteries of the periphery which seems a not im probable supposition Although even with this change the crests of the TraubeEering wave do not absolutely coincide with the points of the greatest diminution of the kneejerk curve and viceversa yet the coincidence is much more striking and additional weight seems to be given to the infer ence that there may be some connection between the two curves It will be noticed that at one point of the kneejerk there was a disturbing factor caused by the slamming of a door below at A sending the kneejerk up at this point and thereby apparently making the summit of this kneejerk wave farther along than it otherwise would have been In Fig 18 there is a much closer coincidence in the two waves than in Fig 16 IIere the TraubeHering curve makes a long descent between 4 and 5 with a still longer ascent to 6 Again it is to benoted thatat 4 where the TraubeEering wave descends lowest the kneejerk curve is also longest The same general coincidence of the two curves is again seen in Fig 19 This was one of the earliest tracings and the writing needle of the Marey tambour connected with the plethysmograph did not make as good a record as it did later At the end of the record the patient fell into his deepest sleep with the entire disappearance of the kneejerk It is interest ing to note that although the TraubeHerirlg curve continues after the kneejerk has entirely disappeared yet at no point does the TraubeIIering wave descend as low as at A where there was the longest group of kicks As in Figs 16 and 17 there is the same nllmber of waves in the kneejerk curve as in the TraubeIIering curve Fig 20 is from another of the early tracingst but it serves to show the same general characteristics that have been brought out by the other curves At A a secondary wave appears on the long descent between 6 and 7 and slight cor357 PECULIARITIES OF TEE ENEEJERE responding changes may be noted in the kneejerks below A11 the plethysmographic tracings given were taken from the left arm As it would be valuable confirmatory evidence to obtain similar tracings from the leg a tin plethysmograph in the shape of a boot was made and in this the patients right foot and leg were placed the rubber band that served to keep back the water coming just below the knee Into each plethysmograph water of 30 C was poured to take up the extra air space not occupied by the leg and arm The water did not quite fill the plethysmographs a small air space being left at the top to allow free access of the air to the opening communicationg with the glass tube and Marey tambour A much better tracing was made by the writing needle with the water in the plethysmograph than with this empty as the pulsations were thus confined to the small body of air directly above the water and the arc of vibration of the needle corre spondingly increased The leg plethysmograph was sus pended from the ceiling in the same way as that for the arm and it was still possible to have the left leg which was still the upper one7 in the same position as before for the kneejerk experiments Tracings were then made showing synchronous right leg and left arm plethysmographic curves and the left kneejerk curve Itwasfound however thatthe jarringof the blow of the hammer on the left leg communicated itself through the bony pelvis sufficiently to affect the right leg in the plethysmograph causing a serious vibration of the needle with each blow interfering with the production of a good curve The arm and leg plethysmographic curves were then taken without the kneejerk curve with better results and a general correspondence was found The leg plethysmographic curve was never as satisfactory as that of the arm for it was possible to place the whole arm in the plethysmo graph the strong pulsation of the radial artery being strong enough to give a wellmarked tracing but no similarly strong pulsation could be obtained from the foot and calf of the leg While therefore7 the experiments with the leg plethysmo graph need to be carried farther yet so far they point to similar results as with the arm Shollld the conclusions suggested by the knee jerk and plethysmographic curves seem to be justified and should they be borne out by farther research7 the kneejerk would thus be brought into connection with the other rhythmical and periodic activities of the body The vasomotor influence that produces the TraubeEIering curves is necessarily constantly active but its effects are usually obscured by many other con ditions It would appear probable on apriort grounds that the TraubeHering curve would come out more clearly where358 NOYES the cerebral inafluence was removed or inhibited and we find the TraubeIering curve coming out with marked distinct ness in our demented subject For the same reason we should expect any phenomenon associated with the TraubeEering curve also to come out better in such an individual than in a normal subject and so we find the  groups  if the relation to the TraubeEering is a true one coming out in this same patient As the TraubeHering curve is constantly influen cing the normal respiratory rhythm may we not also assume that the TraubeHering kneejerk curve if it is permissible to call it such is alsoconstantly influencing the kneejerke This would explain the mysterious  rhythm  that has seemed to be present in many of the earliest lineejerk curves taken in this patient even when awake We are led from this to a consideration of the kneejerk of normal individuals and if the inferences as to the influences aiiecting the kneejerk in this demented man are legitimate it is not evident why the same inferences do not apply to the normal subject If this is the case then the original point of the investigation no longer has any bearing that is the question as to the theoretically lesser variability of the knee jerk in a demented person than in a healthy individual the tops of the knee jerks of a dement forming theoretically a straighter line than in a sound person rhe normal kneejerk curve therefore could no longer be considered as theoretically a straight line but as a ttue curve correspondingin general with the Traube Hering curve It mustbe admitted at once that it is extremely doubtful if this can ever be shown on a normal illdividual with the constantly varying emotional condition of healthy persons nor does it seem scareely more likely that a normal individual will show such curves even in sleep as are seen in this patient for the reason that the cerebral influences in a sound person would probably mask this ebb and blow but this is mere con jecture and must be submitted to actual experiment It remains to add that if the nervous force or irrita bility of the spinal cord is really subject to this rhythmic action the question is at once raised if the higher cerebral activities especially the attention are also subject to a simi lar rise and fall for if the rhythm e already described be really due to a vascular process of vasomotor origin this same influence must afleet also the functional activity of the brain itself Conc7ustons The chief interest in the results brought out in this paper lies in the fact that the experiments were conducted on a per son whose mind has been weakened by dementia of

seems to be that there has been a weakening of the inhibitory influence normally eserted by the brain over the lower centres The remarks of Mitchell and Lewisl have so much bearing on this point that they may properly be quoted here In discussing the cause of the increase of the kneejerk from sensory stimuli they say  It is very difficult to explain the fact that electricity sensory impressions and distant voluntary muscle acts increase the knee jerk and the response to the muscle blow If we conceive of a series of inhibitory centres estending from the meso cephalon a11 the way down the cord and infer that a11 the agents mentioned are capable by more or less paralyzing these centres of releasing the active refles groups below them we shall be able to comprehend that the centre thus set free may by increasing tone give to the muscle a suddenly enlarged capacity to respond to the tendon taps or the muscle blow Nearly a11 the facts with which we are concerned may be explained by inhibition organs and the eiiects produced upon them On the other hand it is equally conceivable that when ever a sensation reaches the cord or brain or both an over ilow occurs which shall by increasing the excitation of the centres be felt throughout the body and reinforce any organs chancing to be synchronously otherwise excited from without Under this view we conceive of the nervous force as not confined entirely to the direct paths between the centres and themuscle to be moved but as overflowing so as to pass through numer ous ganglia adding a certain small increment to their effects when in a state of such activity as the spinal toning centres must be at all times The tone centres thus stimulated send out a higher wave of excitability to all the muscles and if at the time this reaches a muscle that muscle is being excited by a tap there is an increased response Assuming such inhibitory centres as Mitchell and Lewis describe these would only be kept up to their full functional activity by the healthy condition of the whole nervous system so that whenthese inhibitory centres are under a weakened cerebral influence as in dementia they offer less resistance to what Mitchell and Lewis call the paralyzing influence of sen sory stimuli In the normal healthy individual in sleep a sen sory stimulus preceding a blow on the patellar tendon pro duces a rise extending at most over a few kicks This is certainly the most economical method for the individual if we consider that it is beneficiaA that the effect of the accidental stimuli that are continually assaulting the nervous system  Loc cit p 203 359 PlisfTTT T A DTmTRO f tU 1KTUR TD J tJ llslJIs XJ1 sJ 1v sJsJd XJ360 NOYES should be prevented from spreading over a wide territory or through a long time In our demented patient a stimulus produces an effect extending usually over a much longer time even so long as three minutes The eperiments appear to give a graphic demonstration of the greater susceptibilityto sounds and a11 esternal stimuli in persons with enfeebled but not organically diseased nervous systems If this susceptibility to long continued eiiect of sensory stimuli in this patient is really due to weak ened cerebral inhibitory power it seems not improbable that the same effect must be produced in individuals with brains weakened or exhausted from any causenot necessarily from insanity The large class of neurasthenic individuals naturally first occurs to one and the question arises whetherJ when such patients feel every sound in their back  this is not due to the uninhibited propa gation of accidental external stimuli to the lower refle centres as shown in these kneejerk curves If so the thera peutic corollary to this proposition the necessity of excluding to the greatest possible extent a11 accidental stimuli from such patients is graphically demonstrated in these curves The conclusions with regard to the socalled rhythm have already been discussed The results of the esperiments may be summarized in the two following propositions In a case of terminal dementia of many years duration a series of experiments on the kneejerk tend to show that 1st Sensory stimuli received during sleep produce a much greater effect and diffuse over a much longer interval than in healthy individuals 2nd In a condition of halfsleep when the patellar tendon is struck by blows of uniform strength at five seconds inter vals the kneejerks fall into groups and synchronous plethysmographic tracings suggest that these groups have some connection with the TraubeHering curve If the truth of the second proposition can be conclu sively established several important corollaries would seem to follow These are here stated as facts for the sake of presenting definite propositions the truth or falsity of which must be submitted to further experimental investigation a The kneejerk curve instead of being theoretically a straight line as has been heretofore assumed is in reality a curved line with the general characteristics of the Traube Hering curve b The spinal cord is not constantly in a condition of the highest potential functional activity but its activity is repre sented by a curve of rhythmic vascular contraction and dilaPECULIARITIES OF THE ENEEJE RE 361 tation During the phase of contraction of the spinal arteries the spinal cord is at its least functional activity due to a con dition of relative anaemia while during the phase of dilatation of the spinal arteries the spinal cord is at its greatest fllnc tional activity due to a condition of relative hyperemia c The question inevitably raised by b is whether the higher activities of the brain are also subject to a rhythmic rise and fall synchronous with vascular dilatation and con traction It remains to express my obligations to several who have assisted me in the details of the work and to extend my thanks to my colleague Dr D lI Fuller and to Drs

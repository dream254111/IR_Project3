QUANTITY OF WATER A FALL OF SNOW IS EQUAL,I206921,224 RECEIVED JUNE 5 1766 XXVI A LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY CONTAINING A NEW MANNER OF MEASURING THE VELOCITY OF WIND AND AN EXPERIMENT TO ASCERTAIN TO WHAT QUANTITY OF WATER A FALL OF SNOW IS EQUAL KIRKNEWTON MAY 13 1766 MY LORD I SHOULD THINK MYSELF MOST UNWORTHY OF THE HONOUR WHICH YOUR LORDSHIP AND THE ROYAL SOCIETY HAVE DONE ME IF THE NOTICE WHICH YOU WE PLEASED TO TAKE OF MY LETTER UPON THE LATE COMET DID NOT MAKE ME MORE CAREFUL TO OBSERVE WHATEVER I THOUGHT MIGHT TEND TO IMPROVE THE KNOWLEDGE OF NATURE WHICH IS A CAPITAL PART OF THE LAUDABLE DESIGN OF THE SOCIETY READ JUNE 19 1766 YOUR LORDSHIP KNOWS THAT MY SITUATION EXPOSES ME TO EVERY BLAST THAT BLOWS AND AFFORDS A FAIR OPPORTUNITY FOR MEASURING THE VELOCITY OF THE WIND THE FORCE OF WHICH I AM SO OFTEN OBLIGED TO FEEL I HAVE ATTEMPT ED TO DETERMINE THIS BY LETTING LIGHT DOWNY FEATHERS FLY IN THE WIND THE METHOD I UNDERSTAND USED BY THE INGENIOUS DR DERHAM BUT CANNOT SAY IN ALL THE TRIALS I HAVE MADE THOUGH I HAVE LET FIFTY OF THESE FEATHERS FLY ONE AFTER THE OTHER AT A TIME THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN ABOVE ONE OR TWO AT MOST UPON WHICH I COULD HAVE FOUNDED A CALCULATION THE VELOCITY OF THE WIND NEAR THE EARTH IS VERY UNEQUAL UPON ACCOUNT OF THE 2225 THE FREQUENT INTERRUPTIONS IT MEETS WITH FROM HILLS TREES AND HOUSES AND EVEN IN OPEN PLAINS THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH THOUGH MUCH SMOOTHER THAN IT COMMONLY IS MUST REFLECT AND INTERRUPT SUCH A FLUID AS THE AIR AND OCCASION GREAT IRREGULARITY IN THE VELOCITY OF ITS CURRENT THIS IS THE REASON WHEN A FEATHER IS LET FLY WITH THE WIND WHY IT SELDOM IF EVER DESCRIBES A STRAIT LINE BUT MOVES SOMETIMES IN A KIND OF SPIRAL NOW HIGH AND THEN LOW SOMETIMES TO THE RIGHT AND THEN AGAIN TO THE LEFT AND WHY TWO FEATHERS LET FLY AT ONCE SELDOM IF EVER KEEP TOGETHER OR DESCRIBE SIMILAR LINES BUT AT SOME CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM THE EARTH THE VELOCITY OF THE WIND SEEMS TO BE REGULAR AND STEADY NOTHING CAN BE MORE UNIFORM THAN THE VELOCITY OF A CLOUD IN THE SKY APPEARS TO BE EVEN IN THE GREATEST STORM IT IS LIKE A SHIP CARRIED AWAY INSENSIBLY BY A SMOOTH AND GENTLE CURRENT PASSING OVER EQUAL SPACES IN EQUAL TIMES THIS SUGGESTED THE THOUGHT THAT THE MOTION OF A CLOUD OR ITS SHADOW OVER THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH WOULD BE A MUCH MORE PROPER MEASURE OF THE VELOCITY OF THE WIND IN THE END OF MARCH 1763 I HAD AS FAVOURABLE AN OPPORTUNITY OF PUTTING THIS METHOD INTO PRACTICE AS I COULD HAVE WISHED FOR THE STORM WAS EXCEEDING HIGH AND MOVED WITH VAST VELOCITY THE SUN WAS BRIGHT THE SKY CLEAR EXCEPT WHERE IT WAS SPOTTED WITH LIGHT FLOATING CLOUDS I TOOK MY STATION IN THE NORTH WINDOW OF MY DINING ROOM NEAR THE CLOCK FROM WHICH I HAD A FREE PROSPECT OF THE FIELDS THE SUN WAS IN THE MERIDIAN THE WIND DUE WEST INTERSECTING HIS RAYS AT RIGHT ANGLES I WAITED UNTIL THE FOREPART OF THE SHADOW OF A CLOUD THAT WAS DISTINCT AND WELL VOL LVI G G DEFINED226 DEFINED JUST TOUCHED A SOUTH AND NORTH LINE WHICH I HAD MARKED UPON THE GROUND AT THAT INSTANT I BEGAN MY RECKONING AND FOLLOWED THE SHADOW WITH MY EYE IN ITS PROGRESS COUNTING SECONDS ALL THE WHILE BY THE CLOCK UNTIL I HAD RECKONED UP 15 SECONDS THEN I OBSERVED EXACTLY WHERE THE FORESAID EDGE OF THE SHADOW WAS THIS EXPERIMENT I REPEATED TEN TIMES IN HALF AN HOUR AND SELDOM FOUND THE DIFFERENCE OF A SECOND IN THE TIME WHICH DIFFERENT CLOUDS TOOK TO MOVE OVER THE SAME SPACE ON THE 5TH OF MAY CUR RENT I REPEATED THE TRIAL FOUR DIFFERENT TIMES THE SUN BEING ALSO NEAR THE MERIDIAN THE WIND IN THE WEST WITH LIGHT CLOUDS FLOATING IN A CLEAR SKY AS FORMERLY AND FOUND THAT THE SHADOWS OF DIFFERENT CLOUDS TOOK SOME OF THEM 44 AND OTHERS 45 SECONDS TO PASS OVER THE SAME SPACE WHICH THEY HAD MOVED OVER IN 15 SECONDS IN THE FORMER TRIALS FEET THIS SPACE MEASURES EXACTLY 1384SPACE PASSED OVER IN 15 SECONDS WHICH MULTIPLIED BY 4 GIVES 5536SPACE PASSED OVER IN ONE  WHICH MULTIPLIED BY 60 GIVES 332160SPACE PASSED OVER IN ONE HOUR WHICH SPACE IS 629 ENGLISH MILES PER HOUR THE VELOCITY OF THE WIND IN MARCH 1763 ONE THIRD OF THIS OR 21 MILES NEARLY SHEWS THE VELOCITY OF THE WIND ON MAY THE 6TH WHEN IT BLEW A FRESH GALE THIS DAY MAY 12 THERE WAS A SMALL WESTERLY BREEZE THE VELOCITY OF WHICH I MEASURED UPON THE SAME LINE THE SUN BEING 10 MINUTES PAST THE MERIDIAN AND FOUND THAT THE SHADOW TOOK 95 SECONDS TO PASS OVER THE ABOVE227 ABOVE SPACE WHICH GIVES THE VELOCITY OF THE WIND AT THE RATE OF 99 ENGLISH MILES PER HOUR THUS BY HAVING SEVERAL LINES IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS OF A KNOWN LENGTH MARKED UPON THE GROUND ONE MAY EASILY AND WITH GREAT ACCURACY I IMAGINE MEASURE THE VELOCITY OF THE WIND IF A PERSON WAS PROVIDED WITH AN INSTRUMENT FOR MEASURING THE FORCE OF THE WIND IT WOULD PERHAPS BE WORTH WHILE TO OBSERVE WHETHER WHEN THE VELOCITIES OF DIFFERENT WINDS WERE THE SAME OR NEARLY SO THE FORCES OF THESE WINDS DID NOT VARY WITH THE SEASONS OF THE YEAR THE POINTS OF THE COMPASS FROM WHICH THE WIND BLOWS AND ALSO WITH THE DIFFERENT STATE OF THE BAROMETER AND THERMO METER SINCE THE MOMENTUM OF THE WIND DEPENDS NOT ONLY UPON ITS VELOCITY BUT ALSO UPON ITS DENSITY FROM THE END OF MARCH 1765 TO THE END OF MARCH LAST WE IN THIS PART OF SCOTLAND HAD VERY LITTLE RAIN AND LESS SNOW IN PROPORTION OUR RIVERS WERE AS LOW THROUGH THE WINTER AS THEY USE TO BE IN THE MIDDLE OF SUMMER SPRINGS FAILED IN MOST PLACES AND BREWERS AND MALSTERS WERE OBLIGED EVEN IN WINTER TO CARRY THEIR WATER AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE I WAS MUCH AFRAID THERE WOULD NOT BE MOISTURE ENOUGH IN THE EARTH FOR THE PURPOSES OF VEGETATION IF THIS SEASON SHOULD SET IN AS DRY AS THE FORMER BEFORE WE GOT A NEW SUPPLY OF RAIN IN THE END OF MARCH LAST WE HAD A FALL OF SNOW AND AS I DID NOT REMEMBER TO HAVE EVER READ AN ACCOUNT OF SUCH AN EXPERIMENT I WISHED TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE TO WHAT QUANTITY OF RAIN THIS FALL OF SNOW WAS EQUAL THE SNOW HAD BEEN FALLING FROM FIVE OCLOCK THE FORMER EVENING TILL TEN OCLOCK NEXT DAY ABOUT ELEVEN OCLOCK I MEASURED THE DEPTH OF THE SNOW AND FOUND G G 2 IT228 IT TO BE 62 INCHES THEN I TOOK A STONE JUG HOLDING ABOUT THREE ENGLISH PINTS AND TURNED THE MOUTH OF IT DOWNWARDS UPON THE SNOW MEASURED AND WHERE THE GROUND BELOW WAS SMOOTH AND HARD AND BY THIS MEANS I TOOK UP ALL THE SNOW FROM TOP TO BOTTOM IN THE JUG THIS SNOW I MELTED BY THE SIDE OF A FIRE AND THE 62 INCHES OF SNOW YIELDED SIX TENTHS OF AN INCH DEEP OF WATER IN THE SAME JUG AFTER EMPTYING THE JUG I DRIED AND WEIGHED IT IN A BALANCE AND TOOK UP THE SAME QUANTITY OF SNOW IN IT AS BEFORE WEIGHED IT AGAIN AND FOUND THE WEIGHT OF THE SNOW TAKEN UP AND FROM THIS WEIGHT COMPUTED WHAT QUANTITY OF WATER IT SHOULD HAVE PRODUCED AND FOUND THAT IT OUGHT TO HAVE PRODUCED SIX TENTHS OF AN INCH AND 120 OF AN INCH MORE THEN I DISSOLVED THE SNOW AND FOUND THAT IT YIELDED A QUANTITY OF WATER IN THE BOTTOM OF THE JUG SIX TENTHS OF AN INCH DEEP AS IN THE FORMER EXPE RIMENT THE DIFFERENCE OF 120 OF AN INCH IN THE DEPTH OF THE WATER BETWIXT THE WEIGHT AND THE MELT ING OF THE SNOW WAS PROBABLY OWING TO AN EXHALATION FROM THE JUG WHILE THE SNOW WAS MELTING BY THE FIRE FOR I OBSERVED A STEAM SOMETIMES RISING FROM IT A GREATER OR LESSER DEGREE OF COLD OR OF WIND WHILE THE SNOW FALLS AND ITS LYING A LONGER OR SHORTER WHILE UPON THE GROUND WILL OCCASION A DIFFERENCE IN THE WEIGHT AND IN THE QUANTITY OF WATER PRODUCED FROM A CERTAIN NUMBER OF CUBIC FEET OR INCHES OF SNOW BUT IF I MAY TRUST TO THE ABOVE TRIALS WHICH I ENDEAVOURED TO PERFORM WITH CARE SNOW NEWLY FALLEN WITH A MODE RATE GALE OF WIND FREEZING COLD WHICH WAS THE CASE OF THE SNOW I MADE THE TRIALS UPON THE 27TH OF MARCH LAST WILL PRODUCE A QUANTITY OF WATER EQUAL TO 110 PART OF ITS BULK OR THE EARTH WHEN COVERED WITH SNOW TEN229 TEN INCHES DEEP WILL BE MOISTNED BY IT WHEN MELTED RIVERS AND SPRINGS RECRUITED AS MUCH AS IF A QUANTITY OF RAIN HAD FALLEN THAT COVERED THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH OF THE DEPTH OF ONE INCH I AM MY LORD WITH THE GREATEST RESPECT YOUR LORDSHIPS MOST OBEDIENT AND MOST DEVOTED HUMBLE SERVANT ALEX BRICE RECEIVED JUNE 5 1766

Medicine de l Universite de Monpellier A Paris 1700 in 80 THe Ancients in their Divisions of Tumours confounded Cancers with all other hard and painful Swellings These they imagind to pro ceed from an Adust Atrabilarious Blood which opini on they founded on their Exteriour Appearances their Black or Livid Colour and Burning Acrimony The Moderns changing the terms derive them from a cer tain Acid Ferment which first coagulates the Juices in the Glands and after corrodes and ulcerates the part These accounts do not content Mr Geudron who be lieves his Observations have furnished him with a more satisfactory Idea of the Formation of Cancers their dif ference from schirrous scrophulous and other like Tumours and a more sure Prognostick and Cure p 5 There is so great a diversity in Cancers he pretends it is impossible to give one common Definition which shall agree to all Some have a round unequal livid painful hardness others are flat without lividity and sometimes indolent This variety proceeds chiefly from their rise and progress and the structure of the parts in which they are seated as the Breast Womb Mouth Nose Eyes Ears all which differ in their appear ances In p 13477 In the year 1690 a Domestick of the Marquis de N coming to the Author with a hardness on the Fore head which was ulcerated very painful and rebelli ous He several times cicatrized it but all in vain af ter some time it broke forth afresh At length apply ing a stronger Caustick than before and impatient to remove the Escarr stirring it to and fro with his Probe placed on its Center he perceived several white Fila ments in the Interstice between it and the Flesh which with the Probe he found were hard Then pulling away the Escarr with his Forceps the strings came with it not without a great deal of pain to the Patient Some of these sprang from the side of the Nose Eyes others from the upper part of the Forehead and when it was separated they seemd like the strings at the Root of an Onyon or Leek This was the occasion which suggested to M Geudron his first suspicion of the common Doctrine which ascribes these Maladies to Acids in the Blood This Incident encouragd him to make a further Enquiry and having dissected many Cancerous Tumours for these eight years past he gives us these particulars as the result of his Observations p  p 26 Cancers are always seated in Glandulous and Ner vous parts and places where there are Lymphatick and Excretory Vessels There is ever found in them a hard callous substance not unlike a Horn with Blood vessels disseminated thro it which nevertheless are lesser and straiter than before the formation of the hardness In Cancrosities of the skin there is the same callous substance but it expands itself in a very diffe rent manner appearing at first like a plain hard Ulcer or a small Wart with Cancrous Filaments These when the Ulceration has made some progress appear like the heads of pins in the flesh and are no other than the extremities of the strings This substance al ways found in true Cancers this Gentleman thinks is inferredtheinferred478 the Cancer itself which is formed out of the Glands Lymphatick and Excretory Vessels These by some accident or other becoming impervious and ceasing to filtrate and convey their Liquors by degrees degenerate into a compact horny mass capable of Germinating and Ulceration Some observing the good habit of Body not to be prejudiced by Cancers arising and after they have been removed the party has enjoyed a perfect health have thought the part only suffers Others seeing that not withstanding they have been apparently consumed and extirpated they have broke out with greater violence have concluded this effect to proceed from some corro sive Acid still remaining behind and no good to be hoped for till this malignant Ferment be entirely ex tinguished This latter opinion does not agree with Mr Geudrons Theory If such an Acid have an exist ence where is it lodged not in the Blood for Can cers often arise suddenly from some exteriour hurt blow or compression often happen to persons in per fect health to women with a regular evacuation of their Menses Not in the part from an effusion of Lympha there for these sort of Tumours are easily re solved and except sometimes in the Breast rarely or never become Cancerous A thousand Observations shew Cancers in the Skin on the Nose c have fol lowed upon cutting off a Wart These are often with out pain and inflamation and the humour will not change Turnsole Is it not more likely these proceed from some Miliary Gland of the Skin torn from its seat by the divulsion of the Tendinous Fibres which connected it than from any Imaginary Acid p 33 p 34 p 46 As for the Growth of Carcinomatous Tumours our Author thinks being composed of the Extremities of Tendinous Fibres their Vegetation may be explained by the conveying a Nutritious Juice in the same man ner p 46479 ner as Horns and Nails and other like substances The pain proceeds from the compression of the Nervous parts as that in Corns which when any thing hap pens to pinch them is very acute and the lividity from an obstruction of the progress of the Blood If the dis coloration was the effect of any Caustic Salt an Escarr would soon ensue but the blackness of the Cancers lasts many years It is more reasonable than to think the difficulty the Blood finds in its passage makes it stop in some places where losing its fluidity and be coming thick it makes the skin which covers the Can cer appear black and livid and this blackness is observed round the Horns of Animals at their first eruption The Ulceration proceeds either from the bursting of the Teguments by the encreasing swelling or their exesion by the corruption of the stagnating Blood But their incurability arises from an indisposition of the Fibres of the Skin to unite themselves with the Can cerous Lump From this account it is plain Schirrosi ties Strumae which consist of Liquors stopt by their Viscosity or coagulated by any Acid and Polypus where the Vessels keep their order and distribution are essentially different from these carcinomatous swellings but when the structure of the Vessels is once destroyed and they degenerate into a hard indissoluble lump ca pable of shooting out they lose their former nature and become Cancerous Having thus presented you with his Idea of the Na ture and Causes of Cancers he proceeds to the Prog nostick and Cure True Cancers he affirms are seldom extirpated with success and the operation would be less in repute if Strumae schirrous and other Tumours were not frequently mistaken for them Mr Geudron only thinks those can be extirpated whose Basis ends at once and which do not send strings to the neigh E e e e bouring480 bouring parts He laughs at the Precept so often in culcated to suffer the part to bleed freely to discharge the remains of malignity recommending instead of this his own practice to apply pledgits with some Arseni cal Caustick and timely to pull away the Escarr with the Cancrous strings which being harder than the flesh are not presently divided by the Suppuration Pa racelsus and Vanhelmont his Disciple boast very much says he of their Arsenical Preparations and other Mineral Absorbents These indeed may consume the fungous flesh but the Cure consists only in eradicating the callous body which is irritated and protudes it self strangely on the injudicious appli cation of sharp and corrosive Medicines In the year 1692 the Author cured Madam de N of a cancerous Epulis The Excrescence first rose in form of a Button of Flesh from the Alveolus of one of the Dentesmorales of the upper Jaw which had been pul led out This in some years was grown as big as a Goose Egg was hard unequal livid painful and ul cerated with reddish putrid Serosities coming from it Finding by his Rules the cancrosity not to extend be hind its middle he pricks the upper part with a sort of Trocar carefully avoiding the cancerated part puts in his Escarotick Troches and stops the whole with a Sponge Thus the Blood Vessels and Nerves within twenty four hours being cauterized the Mass began to witherand lose its sense he could cut off great par cels without pain and after the separation the rest was cured in few days To shew how necessary dex terity is in an Operator he relates another remarkable case M de V receiving a blow with the Branch of a Tree on the upper lid of his Lefteye had a hard callous and painful Excrescence there was a necessi ty to cut it out or consume it with Causticks The first481 first was impracticable the latter not without danger In this difficulty finding the cancrosity only superfi cial and nothing more to be done but to consume it without hurting the Globe of the Eye he contrives to blow Leaves of Gold between this and the Excrescence which adjusting themselves to the Eye might co ver it from the impression of the Salts The Inven tion succeeded the Tumour was happily consumed and the part cicatrized M Geudron thinks the  famous A phorism of Hippocrates to be best ex plaind by his Hypothesis He thinks it exactly true of such Cancers which have filaments that lye concealed in the Neighbouring parts The at tempting a perfect Cure of these by the Knife Cau tery or Escarticks does only irritate and redouble their progress and creates horrible ulcerations and pains and often puts an untimely end to the Patients life which by palliation might be prolonged Here he commends the wife conduct of the Abbot Geudron his Unkle to the Queen Mother of France Ann of Au stria  Quibus occulti Cancri fiunt non curare melius cura ti enim citius inte reunt non curati vero longius vetam protrahunt Sect 4 38 The topicks he commends for palliation are chiefly these Bella Donna or Solanum Lethale This was the Secret of Percival Willughby and very much recom mended by the Abbot his Unkle but if too long con tinued is prejudicialTo the juice of the Plants he adds Saccharum Saturni The second famous Application is the Bags of the said Abbot made of a porous Stone found in la Beausse calcined and several times extin guished in Vinegar This he has much improved by incorporating with the other Ingredients the Metallick Sulphurs of Iron Copper and Lead The rest contains nothing particular and so we shall not repeat it here The Author promises he will one day give the pumlcik E e e e 2 his482 his observations to confirm his Theory He tells fur ther he had a design to add the History of some dis eases of the Eyes but thinking this more proper for a History of the Diseases of the Five Sences which he intends to write he defers it till that shall see the Light F I N I S London Printed for Sam Smith and Benj Walford Printers to the Royal Society at the

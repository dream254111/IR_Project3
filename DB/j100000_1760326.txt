solid but which so far as the luminiferous vibrations are concerned moves as if it were an elas tic solid The lecturer carried on the mathematical discussion of these two dynamical problemsthe propagation of waves in an elastic solid and the mo tion of a system bof springconnected particles in a straight line side by side usually devoting the first half of a lecture to one problem and the remainder to the other It is impossible here to give any specific account of the contents of the lectures it may be stated how ever that many of the cardinal phenomena of light were shown to be explicable by the hypothesis sketched above but that the phenomenon of double refraction presented apparently insuperable difficul ties as it has done in all previous attempts to explain it By proper suppositions regarding the elasticity of the springs in the mechanical model  of the phe nomenon given above double refraction would indeed be produced but its law would be widely different from that actually observed The lecturer was conversational in his manner made almost no use of notes and was full of enthu siasm for his subject The audience was composed of professors of physics from eastern and western colleges scientific men from Washington and stu dents and instructors of the Johns Hopkins univer sity The lectures while not condensed in form presupposed thorough familiarity with the physical and mathematical theories involved A verbatim report of them from stenographic notes will be issued in a limited edition by the use of the papyrograph process At the close of the course Sir William Thomson was presented by the class with one of Row lands concave gratings as a memento of their con nection with him NORTIIAFRICAN ARCHEOLOGY AT a meeting of the Academy of natural sciences of Philadelphia Sept 25 Dr Daniel G Brinton called attention to a collection of flintchips collected at the station of RasetOued near Biban on the south eastern coast of Tunis and presented to the academy by the Marquis de Nadaillac The specimens con sisted of flintchips arrowpoints and a semilunar shaped implement of small size which resembles the stemmed scrapers found in America This form was obtained from lower levels below the surface and is characteristic in France of the later produc tions of the stone age especially of that epoch called by the French archeologists the epoch of Roben hausen from the locality of that name in Switzer land Chronologically this is regarded as the first epoch of the appearance of man on the globe the previous implementusing animals being probably anthropoids These made use of stone only not having learned the dressing of bone or horn This view adds to the interest of the query as to the pur pose of these scrapers That they were an important E NCE VOL IV No 92 tool to the primitive man is evident from their wide distribution They have been found in France in the Crimea in India in America both North and South and now we have them from Africa The strata in which they have been found are of great antiquity The archeology of the NorthAfrican coast has especial claims to attention as from there apparently a very ancient migration advanced northward pass ing in one direction through Spain and in another by way of Mlalta Sicily and Italy This migration was apparently contemporary with the appearance of the Elephas africanus in Europe Another point of interest connected with NorthAfrican archeology is found in the fact that the only locality in the old world where animal or effigy mounds have been re ported is in Algiers near the forest of TenritelSad south of Miliana As these peculiar structures are so frequent in the Mississippi valley the coincidence is worth noting Prof A Heilprin contended that while on the hypothesis of evolution no objection could be raised to an assumption which made an animal intermediate between man and the anthropoid apes sufficiently intelligent to understand the full value and manu facture of stone implements such as were exhibited yet as a matter of fact paleontological evidence had thus far failed to prove that any such use or manu facture had been made of them as was claimed Indeed no evidence was forthcoming to show that the implements were not the work of man himself despite the fact that no traces of human remains have been found associated with the fragments The assumption that the advent of man dates only to a given period of the socalled stone age was con sidered to be purely gratuitous and to rest solely on negative evidence Many archeologists concur in the belief that mans remains may yet be found in deposits of a strictly tertiary age THE LIMITATIONS OF SUBMAARINE TELEGRAPHY1 THE weight of the conductors says Henry Vivarez in La lumiere electrique plays an important part in submarine telegraphy not merely as a heavy item in the outlay but as one of the principal factors in lay ing down the lines and in taking them up in case of damage When the conductor is being raised the grapplingirons which lift it have to resist not merely the vertical component of the weight of the cable but also the considerable effects resulting from fric tion against the water It thus frequently happens when working at great depths that the conductor may be exposed to a strain greater than it is able to bear and we are forced to have recourse to stratagems to bring it to the surface These artifices consist in the use of two or more ships in raising which is done as shown in figs 2 and 3 or in the most simple cases 1 Reproduced in abridged form from the Electrical review and the cuts from La lunmire electriqte W IT fNOVEMBER 7 1884 SCIIE with the aid of an auxiliary buoy as in fig 4 In any event we see that the difficulties and of course the cost of raising must be considerable Hence to decrease the weight of the cables would be an important step in advance If the weight is in general very great it is because the copper core does not take any part in the strain which the entire cable has to resist We knlow indeed that copper cannot bear a breakingstrain greter ater at ost than 28 kilos per square millimetre Besides it would be 1NCE 439 square millimetre and which is a very precious property their increase in length at the moment of rupture does not exceed one or one and a half per cent Let us consider the deepsea section of cable of the French company from Paris to New York  the socalled PouyerQuertier cable constructed and laid in 1879 by Siemens Brothers of London The respective weight of each of its component elements is per nautical mile copper core 220 kilos FIG 1 FIG 3 elongated by suchl a strain by a very considerable fraction of its initial length and if the core were made to take part in any manner whatever in the strain which the entire cable has to support it would be drawn out beyond its limit of elasticity and would remain permanently elongated whilst the substances in which it is enclosed would return to their natural length It would result that being no longer able to find room in a sheath which had be come too short the copper wire would take a sinuous form in its guttapercha envelope and would occasion at certain points ruptures the effect of which would be to decentralize the wire to perforate the layer of insulating matter and finally to open out a fault in the cable But there exists an alloy silicium bronze which can be drawn out into wires having a conductivity equal to that of copper and a mechanical resistance equal to that of the best iron The use of this alloy would render it possible to set free the coating of the FlG  cables from a part of the strain which it now has to resist and to diminish consequently their dimen sions and weight ires are now made of this alloy having a conducti ity of from ninetyseven to ninety nine per cent of the standard which at 0 C and with the diameter of a millimetre have a resistance of 2057 ohms per kilometre These wires do not break with a less strain than from 45 to 48 kilos per guttapercha 180 kilos hemp or an equivalent 80 kilos 18 wires of galvanized iron of 2 millimetres in diameter 860 kilos external hemp and composition 400 kilos total 1740 kilos Total diameter 30 mil limetres Total mechanical strength 3000 kilos the wires of the covering being supposed to be of iron Weight under water 450 kilos It can support its own weight without breaking for a length of from six to seven miles The Atlantic presents from north to south and at about an equal distance from each continent a sort of longitudinal ridge in which the depths vary from 300 to 400 metres This ridge spreads out in 500 north latitude into the region which has received the principal wires connecting England and France with the United States On both coasts there are depressions in which the bottom is at the depth of from 4000 to 6000 metres The one on the east extends from the south point of Ireland to the lati tude of the Cape of Good Hope and its lefthand FI  4 boundary follows the general outlines of the west coasts of Europe and Africa The two others the northwestern and the southwestern form two basins bordering respectively on the United States and the Antilles and Sout1h America In these depressions soundings have shown certain zones in which the depths exceed 6000 metres the principal of which are found to thle west of the Cana440 S CIE ries to the south of Newfoundland between Porto Rico and the Bermudas and to the right of the Isle of MartenVaz The great depths of the Pacific are differently dis tributed Between Japan and California between 40 and 50 north latitude there is the Tuscarora depression which has depths of from 6000 to 8000 metres Parallel to Japan and the Kuriles there is a depression in which has been found the greatest known depth  8513 metres We see therefore that any new great submarine line having to extend into another zone than that which has received the present Atlantic cables must traverse depressions in which the bottom reaches a maximum depth of 4000 metres The possibility of raising a damaged cable would be very problemiatical under such conditions and it would become certainly impossible in case of a cable from San Francisco to Japan Under these conditions we are forced to conclude that the use of the present cables limits strikingly the progress of submarine telegraphy which must remain confined to certain zones of the Atlantic to inland seas and to lines along the coasts But if we consider the daily progress of applied science and the constantly increasing demand for rapil com munication between nations it is certain that we must shortly undertake the study of new cables in tended to traverse the greatest depths of the ocean for lonlg distances Necessity therefore compels us to investigate the new solutions of the problem which may furnish us with light cables easy to lay and possible to repair A cable made by Mr J Richard4 is composed as follows core of silicium bronze equal in weight to that of the PouyerQuertier  cable or per nautical mile 220 kilos guttapercha 180 kilos layer of hemp 80 kilos The sheathing is formed of 28 wires of galvanized iron of 125 millimetres in diameter each covered with hemp and all twisted into a rope around the dielectric the wires 500 kilos the heimp covering them 250 kilos The weight of tle cable is therefore 1230 kilos in the air and 320 kilos in the water Its diameter is 25 centimetres and its resistance to fracture 2800 kilos of which the core supports onehalf Under these conditions the cable can support fromi eight to nine nautical miles of its length and can be raised from the greatest depths The results of this comparative examination are self evident For an equal conductivity and an approximately equal mechanical strength the new cable is in weight and bulk equal to about twothirds of the Pouyer Quertier cable It would cost about 165 less per mile and would require for laying a slhip and engines of less power and therefore cheaper The reduced armature will suffice to resist friction and the attacks of animal life in the deep sea but for the shore ends we must keep to the types gejerally employed Such as it is and although it may undergo modifications in detail from a more complete study and from ex perience it merits the attention of competent engi neers  1y NCE VOL IV No 92 THE AMIERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION THE twelfth annual meeting of this association held at St Louis from Oct 14 to Oct 17 was one of the most successful in the series The number of members present was large and it is a matter of great promise for the association that state and mu nicipal boards of health were more fully represented than at any previous meeting These occasions have a value far beyond the intrin sic merit of the papers presented The discussions are always instructive often valuable The sanitary questions of municipal life vary essentially in the different cities of the Union and are answered in as many ways and every publichealth officer will find something to leartn as well as instruction to give Several threadbare topics which have occupied the attention of this body for years have disappeared from the programmre such as vaccinationi yellow fever and malaria The order of exercises as arranged by the exec utive committee included the following subjects Hygiene of occupations Hygiene of the habitations of the poor School hygiene Adulteration of food Waterpollution Disposal of sewage by chemical action or irrigation The observable effects upon the public health of official sanitary supervision The work of state and municipal boards of health Dis easegerms Cremation as a sanlitary measure in times of great epidemics Survey of present sanitary situ ation in St Louis Nearly forty papers upon tlese topics were sub mitted By far the larger numlber were of more than average merit giving rise to

evening meeting of the third day attracted the largest audience of the convention This paper which was illustrated by a collection of remarkably goold microphotographs projected upon a screen was substalltially a restatement of observations already made and fortified by additional research Hlis statement that he was still at work upon the study of yellowfever by means of an abundant ma terial

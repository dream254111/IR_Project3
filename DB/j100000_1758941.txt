dead leaves actually moving as of the leaves rustling with the sense or feeling that they are driven by the wind The words descriptive of motion give rather the feeling of action connected with the leaves than a picture of movement itself So to say that the mountains rise is to direct the mental eye upwards rather than to introduce any pic ture of objective motion into the mental land scape So then it seems probable that while we notice moving rather than resting things our mental pictures tend to be representations of resting attitudes rather than pictures of motion And the greater vividness which de scriptions of motion nevertheless possess would seem to be due to the sense of activity that they introduce into our ideas of the objects and that this sense is connected with the mus cular sensations that we are accustomed to associate with all clearly perceived motions seems both probable in itself and in some wise confirmed by Professor Strickers observations The whole leads us in fact to another probable NCE 717 law of mental life viz that since an animals consciousness is especially useful as a means of directing his actions the ideas of actions however they are formed will naturally be among the most prominent elements of the developed and definite consciousness We need not make any assertion about the direct source of these ideas Whether the active muscular sense is a direct consciousness of the outgoing current or a true sense through the mediation of sensory nerves the result will not affect either Professor Strickers argument or our own suggestions In conclusion it may be well to say that if psychology were already a developed experi mental science such independent and hasty observations and generalizations as our au thors would hardly be worth discussion But as things are even very imperfectly conducted observations if they are direct and sincere must be thankfully accepted Something of the same sort may possibly hold good of the similarly hasty suggestions that have here been thrown together JOSIAH ROYCE WEEKLY SUMMARY OF THE PRO GRESS 01 SCIENCE ATMATHEMATICS Algebraical equationsM Walecki in a note presented to the Academie des sciences by M Her mite gives a proof of a fundamental theorem in the theory of algebraical equations viz that every alge braical equation has a root The theorem being evi dent for real coefficients M Walecki assumes the coefficients as imaginary and writes the first mem ber of the equation in the form P  iQ and also makes Fx  P2  Q2 He considers first the case of an equation of odd degree say p then it is only necessary to prove that the equation Fx  0 of de gree 2p has a root To do this he writes x y  z and distinguishes the odd part in z from the even part in the development of Fy  z writing thus Fxf z2 zz2 The resultant of 9 and p is shown to be a real polynomial of odd degree in y and vanishing for a real value of y Two cases present themselves viz one of the functions p or b may vanish identically and this can only be  for the coefficient of the term of highest degree in  is not zero Then p being of odd order Fx has a real divisor of the second degree The second case is when 4 is not identically zero and when i and 4 have a common divisor Fx being then decomposed into the product of two factors The author shows then that in either case a divisor of Fx is obtained of either the first or second degree and with real co efficients thus proving the proposition for an equa tion of odd order A similar investigation is given for equations of even order  Comptes rendus

firehydrants has a tendency to gripe fast to the frostjacket and lift it with the expanding or heaving earth which he de nied for the following reasons 1 The frozen earth slides on the surface of the frostjacket because its expansion is greater than that of iron 2 As the expansion of the earth must be in proportion to the intensity of the cold so will it be greater above than below a given point therefore the first foot of frozen ground will have a greater upward movement than that which is below it and the second foot greater than the third etc Thus it will be seen that the earth below a given point rises more slowly than that above and its friction is opposed to the one above 3 If this is true of feet it is true of inches and of portions of an inch therefore there is a re tardation movement throughout 4 The upward movement of the ground the freezing being greatest towards the surface and such movement involving a more complete fracture of the earth surrounding the frostjacket it follows that the friction is less at this point than that below it and in consequence there is less power to move upward than downward Of course the above does not apply to any construction that the frost can get beneath Mr Frederic Graff noted and described the form of wooden casing which had been successfully used in the early practice of the Philadelphia waterdepart ment In response to the theory advanced in regard to the action of frost in raising the casings of fireplugs and to the statement that if the base of a structure ex tended below the frostline it would not be lifted Prof Haupt remarked that he thought the theory was in part sustained by the fact observed by some of the district surveyors and verified by the accurate measurements they were obliged to make that fences moved bodily to the south and east in consequence of the action of the sun and frost upon the ground on opposite sides of them IIe thought also that the deductions concerning the immobility of structures resting below the frostline were not fully sustained by the facts as in the northwest where ice forms rapidly he had heard of numerous instances of piles driven for bridges and extending some distance below the frostline having been raised as much as five to six inches in a single night and he conceived the ac tion in this case to be similar in kind to that of piles driven entirely through solid ground the only dif ference being in the amountl of the resistance offered by friction and weight of pile The water in freezing around the pile acts upon it as a griper or vice and the expansion of the various strata or laminae of water as they become converted into ice acts as a lever to force up the pile Mr Howard Murphy did not consider the case cited by Prof Haupt as parallel as the socalled piles being driven through water and soft mud were probably columns resting upon their bases and depending but little upon the frictional resistance of the mate 1NCE VOL 1 No 43 rial through which they passed Therefore the ex pansive force upward of the freezing water would be opposed by little more than the weight of the pile whereas in a firehydrant casing or other deeply planted post the presumably wellrammed material around the whole length under ground would offer such proportional frictional resistance as to cause the freezing earth to slide up the post rather than to lift it If the ice could be supposed to act downwards upon the piles in question it is hardly likely that it would have forced them farther home  Eng club Philad meeting Nov 3 411 An enormous steam

conditions of a successful vegetation experiment is uniformity in the seed used With this in mind Hellriegel has investigated the effect of variations in the absolute weight and in the specific gravity of seeds upon the growtli of the resulting plants He finds that of seeds of barley having the same specific gravity the heavier seeds produced at first more vigorous plants than the lighter As the plants continued to grow in good soil the differences gradually diminished until at the time of harvest they had entirely disappeared When the plants grew in poor soil the effect of differ ences in the seed was more lasting and even affected the total weight of the crop Differences of specific gravity in seeds of the same weight produced no rec ognizable effect upon the crop The stage of ripeness of the seeds affected the development of the plants in the same direction as it did the absolute weight of the seeds the riper seeds being heavier and pro ducing the most vigorous plants and the differences being most manifest on a poor soil Essentially the same results were obtained in experiments with po tatoes The attempt was also made to raise potatoes of greater or of less specific gravity by selection the heaviest or lightest being continually selected for seed The experiment was continued through three seasons with a negative result  Ibid xii 530 H P A 417 719 MINERALOGY

weather than on the varying amount of warm surfacewater which enters the Kara basin in different years This warm water depends largely upon the discharge of the great Siberian rivers and differs

by Portugal on the Kongo and else where in the interior of Africa a memorandum was issued some time since by the geographical society of Lisbon in which it was claimed for Portuguese ex plorers that they had revealed to science precise and exclusive information in regard to the orography and hydrology of the Dark Continent The plea of this memorandum has been traversed by President Wau ters of the Royal Belgian geographical society in a very lively and interesting article Without express ing an opinion as to the merits of parties now strug gling for supremacy on the Kongo attention may be called to the manner in which the author shows how the characteristics of the hydrology of the interior of Africa on ancient charts were derived Two centu ries before the Christian era Eratosthenes from in formation obtained on the Ethiopian expedition of Ptolemy Philadelphus described with tolerable accu racy the chief features of the riversystem of Abys sinia and placed the source of the principal branch of the Nile in a lake situated to the southward of that country Ptolemy and the Arabian geographers added other lakes and branches the details of which appear to have been based chiefly on rumor and im agination In 1444 certain Abyssinian monks visited Rome on an ecclesiastical errand and from infor ENCE VOL II No 43 mation derived from them Brother Mauro corrected the geography of that part of the Nile basin comprised in the Abyssinian watershed the remainder finding its source on a vast marsh located in the centre of the continent This appeared on his celebrated Mappemonde in 1458 According to the author and Father Brficker the curious network of lakes and rivers found on the globes of Martin Behaim and medieval geographers which suggest so curiously the lakes and rivers now known to exist were all derived from the sources above mentioned In many cases the names of the lakes and towns can be recognized and in suppressing synonymes and replacing Abyssinian rivers which appear spread over central Africa on such maps where they belong the central region of the conti nent becomes almost a blank It was reserved for  the celebrated De Lisle in the early part of the last century to sweep from the charts every thing not due to actual observation leaving to Livingstone and his successors the occupation of the blank thus made by delineating the physical features recognized in these modern and only authenticated explorations  Bull soc Belg geogr ii 1883 w H D 423 BOTANY Synonymy of higher cryptogams  The No menclator der gefisskryptogamen by

the  direct  light reflex in the eye of the same side If however the eye on the uninjured side is exposed to the light a narrowing of the pupil of both eyes takes place appearing to show that the lesion has involved only the affereilt fibres and not the reflex centre The authors view of the path of the fibres is that they leave the optic nerve at the chiasma pass directly into the gray matter of the walls of the third veln tricle and elnd finally each in the nucleus of tile oc ulomotor nerve of its own side The fibres do not cross anywhere in their course since lesions of either side affect only the corresponding eye and a sagittal section of the floor of the ventricle or of the chiaslla is without effect The nuclei of the oculomnotor nerves he considers as the true centres for the reflex and the commissural fibres connecting these nuclei explain the occurrence of the inlirect reflex that is the narrowing of one pupil when the pupil of the other eye is exposed to light The dilatation of the pupils which follows painful stimulation of any portion of tle periphery of the body cannot be owing to stimulation of fibres running in the sympathetic since in the first place the widening is not nmaximal as it is wh1en the synpanteteic is directly stimulated and in the secoinl 1lace this reflex is entirely de stroyed when a dleep section is made behind or in the posterior part

towards concreteness or abstractness possessed by the various races and exhibited in their speech into concrete and abstract languages The concrete division is again separated into the heterologous having special words when persons of different sex address each other and homologous males and femnales use the same words as if addressing their own sex The abstract division is separated into digeneous and trigeneouis In the former all things are either masculine or feminine in the latter there are three genders Each division is again subdivided into three classes as follows 1 Elder and younger relatives have special terms sex denoted by the words male and female or by modulation 2 IIaving special terms for elder brother and elder sister but one in common for younger brother and younger sister 30 Having four distinct terms for each variety of kinship RIepresenting the concrete and abstract by C and A their classes by a and  and their groups by 1 2 and 3 and the monosyllabic

strategy  The following method of Indian stratagem is told for the first time by Mr HI S Ilalbert Whenl a small party of Muskokis wished to attack a Choctaw village they would ar range themselves il ambush at convenient intervals to within three hundred yards of the village The bravest man would now crawl up as near the vil lage as practicable dig a pit and place himself in it where he would wait until daybreak The first VOL II No 43 Choctaw whom he then saw stirring about near his ambuscade he would shoot down spring forward and scalp him in the twinkling of an eye He would then flee toward the second ambuscader If he was pur sued which was generally the case the pursuer re ceived tlie fire of this ambuscader The two warriors then fled to the third man in ambush If the pursu ers still followed they received the fire of this man The three now ran to the fourth ambushed warrior where the same scene was enacted and so on until the place of thle last man was reached  Amer an tiq v 277

fossil plants with their geological relations which will probably be published during the coming spring Fiftyone boxes of Fort Union fossil plants collected by Mr Ward near Glendive Montana last July have been received at the office of the survey A paleontological report on the paleozoic fossils of the Eureka district of Nevada by Mr Charles D Walcott is almost ready for the press The number of paleozoic fossils from this district exceeds four hundred species During the month of October a large numtber of Potsdam fossils from Saratoga NY and some Tren ton fossils from Trenton Falls NY were added to the collections in the hands of Mr Walcott who has charge of the department of paleozoic paleontology One of the papers in the fourth annual report of the survey is A review of the NorthAmlerican fossil Ostreidae by Dr C A White It will be illustrated by fortyeight fullpage plates of figures giving figures of all the leading species of fossil forms of oysters and of the leading varieties of Ostrea virginica for comparison For it also Pro fessor Angelo Heilprin furnishes a revised catalogue of the tertiary oysters and Mr John A fRyder adds a concise lifehistory of the cormmon oyster illustrat ing its anatomy and giving the results of his recent experimnents in the artificial propagation of oysters Chemistry  A laboratory to be in charge of Prof F W Clarke is being organized in connection with the survey Heretofore the chemical work of the survey has been done at various laboratories scattered through the country and at the fieldlaboratories at Denver Salt Lake City and San Francisco A labo ratory for physical experiments will probably be es tablished in connection with the chemical division WeVet Virginia forests  During September and Oc tober Col George W Shutt examined the southern andl eastern portions of West Virginia with especial referelece to the distribution of timber its economic value and tile facilities of transportation to market vri the streams of the region Ile travelled over a thousand miles by wagon and two hundred on horse back and expresses the opinion that nearly onehalf of the state is covered with a virgin forest the value of which if rendered marketable would amount to billions of dollars Geology  In mlaking an excavation a few weeks ago for a building on Connecticut Avenue in the northwestern section of Washington DC the interesting discovery was made of the remains of a subterranean forest The fact was mentioned at the meeting of the Biological society of Washington Nov 2 by Professor Lester F Ward and from the excel lent preservation of the wood the opinion was ex pressed that it was simply a collection of driftwood that had been washed into a ravine in comparatively recent time Mr W J McGee of the Geological survey who has been working up the geological structure of the District of Columbia for some time had also examined the locality in question ald was of the opinion that the deposit was of quaternary or prequaternary age A few days after the meeting of the Biological society above mentioned he with Professor Ward Mr G K Gilbert and Mr J B Mar cou reexamined the buried forest and Mr McGees opinion was confirmed  the stratum was foundl to underlie the quaternlary gravels of the district The occurrence is of interest since the slightly altered wood undoubtedly represents the end of the long interval extending from the cretaceous to the begin ning of the quaternary duriing which the lignite beds and ironore deposits so commnon in the region were formed Publications The survey has just issued a mnis cellaneous work one of a series of statistical papers which is distinct from the Monographs and Bulle tins but like them is for sale at cost price fifty cents in this case The title of this work is Mineral resources of the United States by Albert Williams jun chief of division of miniing statistics and tech nology In its 813 pages it gives the statistics of our mineral production for the year ending June 1883 and also a mass of infosrmation in relation to the production of coal petroleum iron copper lead and zinc It also treats of buildingstones clams fertili

the said Win G Lindsey and Rebecca J Lindsey and the children of said Wim G Lindsey and Rebecca J Lindsey and the further consideration of the reservation by the said Judith Rowland of a right should she see fit to claim it to remain in the family of the said Wm G Lindsey and Rebecca J Lindsey as a member thereof during her natural life and to be cared for as such by the said Wm G Lindsey or Rebecca J his wife she said Judith Rowland doth grant confirm and hereby convey unto the said Wmn G Lindsey     in trust for the following uses and purposes towit For the use support and maintenance of the said Rebecca J Lindsey the wife of the said Wm G Lindsey and for the use maintenance and education of the issue of said Wm G Lindsey and Rebecca J his wife it being the intention hereof that the said Rebecca J Lindsey shall be supported from said property or the proceeds thereof during her life and that the issue of the said Rebecca J Lindsey and the said Wm G Lindsey during the life of the said Rebecca J Lindsey shall be supported and educated from the proceeds of said property and at the death of said Rebecca J Lindsey all the said property as well as proceeds arising from the same

should he deem it best to do so to continue to hold said property or the proceeds thereof together for the use of the children of the said Wm G Lindsey and Rebecca J Lindsey until the youngest living

proceeds from the property for her life but the court below fixed her interest at oneeighth of the pro ceeds for her life giving to each of her seven cAildren oneeighth and in this ruling there is no error1901 LINDSEY V ECKEL 549 It is argued for the appellant that the case is controlled by the line of decisions by this court beginning with Wallace v Dold 3 Leigh 278 and coming down to Walke v Moore 98 Va 729 There is no sort of conflict between that line of cases and the decree of the Corporation Court in this case as this case is readily distinguished from them The late Judge Burks in his excellent note to the opinion in Nye v Lovitt 2 Va L R 38 referring to the class of cases beginning with Wallace v Dold supra shows that in no one of them is the decision that the children took no interest rested alone on the  guage that the gift is to  the mother and her children but that  the intention to give exclusively to the woman is deduced from the context and the language of the instrument taken as a whole and in conclusion he says  The decisions only show that when the gift is to the woman and her child or children or is in trust for them or like phraseology is used the children are excluded only when it appears from the con text or the whole instrument taken together that it was the intention to exclude them See also Vaughan v Vaughan 97 Va 322 Whether construing a deed or a will the object is to discover the intention which is to be gathered in every case from the general pur pose and scope of the instrument in the light of the surrounding cir cumstances Stacey v Bumgardner 89 Va 421 Pom Eq Jur sec 1012 2d ed Technical rules of construction are not to be invoked to defeat the intention of the maker of the instrument when his or her intention clearly appears by giving to the words used their natural and ordinary import In this case Mrs Lindsey is given no control whatever over the property conveyed in trust for her and her issue by W G Lindsey and no power to dispose of it either through the trustee by deed or by her will but it is deeded by the grantor a collateral kinswoman of Mrs Lindsey expressly to the trustee and he to manage control sell and reinvest the proceeds The consideration moves from the children as well as from the mother and equally from the mother and from the children The trusts upon which the property is conveyed are  for the use support and maintenance of said Rebecca J Lind sey and for the use maintenance and education of the issue of the said Wim G Lindsey and Rebecca J Lindsey his wife The grantor however was not content to leave in doubt what she intended by the use of the language just quoted and declared her own con550 7 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Dec struction of that language and emphasized her intention by adding It being the intention hereof that the said Rebecca J Lindsey shall be supported from said property or the proceeds thereof during her life and that the issue of the said Rebecca J Lindsey by the said W G Lindsey during the life of the said Rebecca J Lindsey shall be supported and educated from the proceeds of said property If the mother as is contended by the appellant took the whole of the proceeds from the property during her life the express trust in favor of the issue is defeated and the declaration of the grantor as to her intention must be regarded as meaningless and might as well not have been made Whether the language theretofore employed by the grantor creates a trust in favor of the issue of Mrs Lindsey or not the declaration she makes as to her iiltention leaves no doubt whatever that the grantor intended to create an express trust for both the support of Mrs Lindsey and the support and education of her issue by W G Lindsey out of the proceeds from the property conveyed during the life of Mrs Lindsey The mother and her issue took each an equal interest in the proceeds from the property during the life of the mother and at her death the issue take the property in feesimple We are of opinion therefore that the decree of the lower court is plainly right and it is affirmed Affirmed NOTETlhe decision in this case indicates an intention on the part of the court to get back to common sense in construing the much mooted limitation  to wife and children The late Judge Burks gave the irnpetus for this return to reason in lhis note to Nye v Lovitt 2 Va Law Register 3940 cited with approval in the principal case In Vaughan v Vaughan 97 Va 322 5 Va Law Reg 443 also cited in the principal case the late Judge Riely launched a strong dzctum in the same directioncommented upon editorially in 5 Va Law Reg 491 See also an elaborate criticism of this view by Mr Barbour in 5 Va Law Reg 427 The principal case did not involve the precise question at issue in these various discussions namely the effect of a gift to wife and children simplybut the opinion clearly indicates an approval by the unanimous court of Judge Burks note and Judge Rielys dictumand leaves but little room for doubt that the court as at present constituted would reject the absurd notion that a gift  to wife and children without more carries the whole estate to the wife and notliin to the childrena notion which ten years ago seemed too deeply in trenched in our local jurisprudence for judicial assault

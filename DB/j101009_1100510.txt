EXCELLENT NOTE TO THE OPINION IN NYE V LOVITT 2 VA L R 38 REFERRING TO THE CLASS OF CASES BEGINNING WITH WALLACE V DOLD SUPRA SHOWS THAT IN NO ONE OF THEM IS THE DECISION THAT THE CHILDREN TOOK NO INTEREST RESTED ALONE ON THE  GUAGE THAT THE GIFT IS TO  THE MOTHER AND HER CHILDREN BUT THAT  THE INTENTION TO GIVE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE WOMAN IS DEDUCED FROM THE CONTEXT AND THE LANGUAGE OF THE INSTRUMENT TAKEN AS A WHOLE AND IN CONCLUSION HE SAYS  THE DECISIONS ONLY SHOW THAT WHEN THE GIFT IS TO THE WOMAN AND HER CHILD OR CHILDREN OR IS IN TRUST FOR THEM OR LIKE PHRASEOLOGY IS USED THE CHILDREN ARE EXCLUDED ONLY WHEN IT APPEARS FROM THE CON TEXT OR THE WHOLE INSTRUMENT TAKEN TOGETHER THAT IT WAS THE INTENTION TO EXCLUDE THEM SEE ALSO VAUGHAN V VAUGHAN 97 VA 322 WHETHER CONSTRUING A

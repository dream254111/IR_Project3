venient for some users of the book is no doubt the better policy in a compact manual In this the author follows the wise example of Grays Manual Synonymy with all its confusing difficulties need not be brought to the begin ners notice and for the older botanist anything short of full citations impossible in such a manual is of little or no use Students will be interested in noticing that Order and  Family  are not identical groups but that they stand in their proper relation in this book as in zoological manuals The full citation of authorities for species including double citation where necessary and the cita tion of the author of each family name are welcome novelties in an American botanical manual As to the nomenclature used the statement is made in the preface that the principles adopted by the botanists of the American Association for the Advancement of Science at a meeting held in Rochester N Y in 1892 and in Madison Wis in 1893 supple mentary to the Code of Nomenclature adopted by the International Congress of Botanists held in Paris France in 1867 have been followed Accordingly we have here a manual in which the muchdiscussed  Rochester Rules are in force and from this time forward young botanists will be taught this nomenclature from the first There will henceforth grow up a generation of botanists for whom the names here given are orthodox This book must at once find its way into the schools and colleges to which it may be com mended for the students in systematic botany It remains to be said that the publisher has met and successfully solved the difficult task of bringing so large an amount of matter within the compass of a book not too large for easy carrying into the field It might easily have been made still smaller and lighter by the use of still thinner paper and a little closer trim ming of the margins As compared with the pocket edition of Grays  Manual this is a much larger and heavier book if printed on the same paper and trimmed as closely this book would weigh but twenty ounces instead of thirty as 733 it does now We suggest that in future editions the printer and binder try to make some im provement in this respect CHARLES

terminal buds Endknospen the former in nervated by lateralis nerves the latter by com munis The Psychological Theory of Organic Evolution by H Heath Bawden is an attempt to put some meaning into the term mental evo lution without falling into the error of talking about unconscious mental states Natural selection may in some instances be a survival of the fittest among accidental variations but in many cases natural selection takes place in and through the conscious adaptation of means to ends The condition of consciousness is organic tension The evolution of consciousness has followed the path of critical stress in adaptation of organic forms Hence the criterion for the presence of consciousness is not simply adapta tion of means to ends bu t adaptation under con ditions of organic tension i e the ability to vary the use of means in the attainment of an end The Popular Science Monthly for November has for frontispiece a portrait of Charles Darwin NOVEMBER 8 1901N S VOL XIV No 358 and

the presidency of West Virginia University and the election of Dr Purinton of Denison to succeed him another turbulent period in the history of that institution has come to an end It is worth noting that no one of the six men who have served as presidents of the West Vir ginia University since its foundation in 1867 has proved generally acceptable to the people of the State and that no one has been less acceptable than President Raymond And yet according to a statement made to the writer by one member of the University faculty who has always lived in Morgantown no other presi dent began his work under more auspicious circumstances The board of regents had a good working majority of intelligent men who were deeply interested in the welfare of the University and who were anxious to give a hearty support to their enthusiastic young presi dent The people in the surrounding commu nity and the members of the faculty were also more friendly and more inclined to be pleased with Mr Raymond than they had been with any of his predecessors Notwithstanding all this trouble was inevi table The president was young aggressive and thoroughly saturated with the spirit of unlimited rushing expansion which had pre vailed in the University of Chicago during the preceding five years The faculty of the West Virginia University on the other hand did not at that time 1897 contain a single PhD from any reputable university Some of the pro fessors were therefore naturally unfit to be in charge of any department in a modern college or university and their unfitness became es pecially glaring through the new presidents vigorous attempts to convert the old Morgan town institution into a miniature copy of the University of Chicago Several of the profess ors moreover not only lacked the training necessary to make them competent instructors in a iuniversity but were in addition so addicted to financial schemes and to politics as to be a hindrance to the peaceful development of any state institution of learning Unhampered and alone Mr Raymond suc ceeded for a time in carrying out his plans in the management of the University The Uni versity catalogue was entirely remodeled on the plan of the University of Chicago catalogue and the studies were correspondingly rear ranged the summer quarter was added and the fourquarter system with the quarterly convocations was introduced an unlimited elective system of studies leading to one degree only BA was adopted faculty meetings were abolished and the presidents plans and changes were all carried out by means of com mittees of his own appointment All these changes and many others less funda mental though scarcely less irritating to one or another among the professors followed in rapid succession One by one the older mem bers of the faculty came to feel that they were entirely unsatisfactory and that the president would like nothing better than to replace them as soon as possible by men of his own selection This led to a tacit or open combination of the greater number of the professors against the presidenta result which might have been ex pected especially considering the records of forced resignations reappointments and quar rels of various kinds which formed a part of the previous history of the University The opposition spread rapidly not only among the students and the people of Morgantown but also throughout the State where it unfortu nately developed into a narrowminded support of West Virginians as against  foreigners The temper of some of the crudest of Mr Raymonds enemies is well illustrated by the extravagant vulgarity of the attacks which were made upon him during the winter and spring of 1900 by the Clarksburg News and the New Dominion of Morgantown The unpopu larity of the president alike among the faculty students and the people especially the local people was in addition much increased by his SCIENCE 735

the instrument to which it is attached It must not be in itself a separate legal instrument The reasoning in support of the doctrine of necessity would seem to proceed somewhat as follows An indorsement is an institution of the law merchant and carries with it consequences that are peculiar to itself a writing to be subjected to those consequences must be made in the manner prescribed by the custom of the merchants such custom has required the indorsement to be made either on the instrument or when the back of the latter is already filled then on a paper attached for the purpose that if the writing appears on an attached paper in the absence of the element of necessity it must be pre sumed that the intention was to avoid the consequences of the technical in dorsement and make the writing a mere assignment The cases then on the matter of an allonge would seem to show three lines of decision first one which requires necessity to be present before allowing the allonge and indorsement thereon and which places no stress on the nature of the paper used second one which permits mere convenience to warrant the allonge and which likewise places no stress upon the nature of the paper third one which places all stress upon the nature of the paper attached and requires it to be of a character other than that of a separate instrument made for an independent purpose The instant case is of the first class and it places Alabama among those jurisdictions that have expressly repudiated the doctrine initiated by Crosby v Roub T H W RIGHTS OF THE PARTIES TO A CONTRACT DISCHARGED BY IMPOSSIBILITY OF PERFORMANCEIn consideration of the defendant moving plaintiffs barn and paying plaintiff Ioo the plaintiff agreed to allow the defendant to use his land Before defendant moved the plaintiffs barn it was burned through no fault of either party Plaintiff now sues to recover the loss which he has suffered by reason of the failure of defendant to move the barn Held Plaintiff can recover and the measure of damages is what it would have cost defendant to move the barn JonesGray Construction Co v Stevens Ky I9I6 I8I S W 659 Where contracts after being partly performed are discharged because of impossibility of performance difficult questions arise as to the rights of the parties If the contract is divisible and severable e g if the price paid for the performance is payable in installments as a certain portion of the work is completed and these installments are proportioned to the value of the work done the plaintiff can recover for the installments fully earned Richardson v Shaw i Mo App 234 SiegelCooper Co v Eaton Co I65 Ill 550 46 N E 449 If the contract is not severable and the consideration is entire for the complete performance of the contract the court cannot make over the contract by apportioning the consideration and the recovery if any must be quasicontractual The question has frequently arisen where plain tiff agreed to furnish labor and materials in the improvement of an existing building and the building is accidentally destroyed after part of the work is done The weight of American authority in such cases is to the effect 488NOTE AND COMMENT that the plaintiff may recover for the fair value of his labor and materials Butterfield v Byron 153 Mass 517 27 N E 667 Dame v Woods 75 N H 38 70 Atl IO8I Hayes v Gross 40 N Y Supp Io98 affirmed without opinion in 162 N Y 6IO 57 N E 11I2 Cook v McCabe 53 Wis 250 IO N W 507 See WOODWARD LAW OF QUASI CONTRACTS  116 Such holding is usually based on the theory that when a contract is discharged by im possibility of performance benefits conferred by either party upon the other in reliance upon the contract the consideration for which cannot now be obtained under the contract constitute an unjust enrichment of the other party By plaintiffs performance his labor and materials have become incorporated into the property of the defendant and thus inured to his bene fit The subsequent loss of the property should be borne by the defendant under the principle ies perit domino The English and a few American au thorities take the opposite view to the above cases and hold that no recovery can be hadupon the short ground that it is a misfortune equally affecting both parties excusing both from further performance of the contract but giving a cause of action to neither Appleby v Myers L R 2 C P 65I I6 L T N S 669 SiegelCooper Co v Eaton Co I65 Ill 550 46 N E 449 Othercases have denied recovery on the more plausible theory that the defendant has not benefitted by plaintiffs performance the improved property having been destroyed Krause v Trustees 162 Ind 278 70 N E 264 Taulbee v McCarty I44 Ky I99 137 S W Io45 In the principal case the parties are reversed the defendant having contracted to work upon plaintiffs property the destruction of which prevents his performance and the plaintiff suing to recover the consideration paid In such a case the principle of Butterfield v Byron supra permits recovery That rule works both ways On the other hand the rule of SiegelCooper Co v Eaton Co supra denies recovery in the one case as well as the other The principle of the last group of cases which denies relief to the party who furnishes labor and material because the defendant is not benefitted is inapplicable to the instant case for the benefit received by defendant has not been lost to him This case is therefore entirely consistent with the earlier Kentucky case of Taulbee v McCarty supra It is submitted however that the measure of recovery laid down in the case viz the amount it would have cost defendant to move plaintiffs barn is erroneous Evidently the court had in mind as the proper measure of damages the amount which the defendant was actually benefitted by his failure to perform This means that if the defendant has made a good bargain under the contract and it would have cost him less to move the barn than the value of plaintiffs land minus the Ioo paid the defendant will be given the advantage of his contract to that extent and is bound to pay plaintiff only the actual cost to himself of the performance The facts show that the cost would have been appreciably less to the defendant than to anyone else for the same performance because he was so situated that he could have done the work at a comparatively low figure But the contract has been discharged by impossibility of performance and since the defendant cannot perform the duties imposed upon him by it neither should he be 489MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW allowed to retain benefits which can be claimed only under it Recovery being quasicontractual the plaintiff is entitled to have restored to him the value he has parted with and for which he has received no return That is the plaintiff is entitled to restitution WOODWARD LAW OF QUASI CONTRACTS 199 The value which the plaintiff has lost and the defendant acquired in this case and the conisideration for which has failed is the use of the plain tiffs land which the defendant has enjoyed It therefore follows that the measure of recovery should be the rental value of the use of the land less the Ioo paid plaintiff by defendant In the cases above cited of partial per formance of improvements on a building the measure of recovery allowed in each case was the value of the labor and materials of the plaintiff In the absence of a contract the measure of recovery for the benefit conferred on defendant at plaintiffs expense is the fair market value of that benefit with out reference to whether defendant was actually enriched by its receipt or how much he was enriched Vickery v Ritchie 202 Mass 8Io 88 N E 835 Rogers v BeckerBrainard Milling Machine Co 2II Mass 559 98 N E 592 Fabian v Wasatch Orchard Co 41 Utah 404 125 Pac 860 If defendant had acquired money from the plaintiff instead of the use of the land the court would not have hesitated to make this sum of money less any value received by plaintiff the measure of recovery Bibb v Hunter 63 Ky 494 and the fact that the benefit takes another economic form should not affect the question W C M SETTING ASIDE A DEFAULT JUDGMENT BECAUSE OF EXCUSABLE NEGLCT BY ATTORNEYIn the recent case of Krause v Hobart 155 N W 279 X had employed an attorney to make defense and the attorney was present when the defaults were called but being busy at the time did not hear the case in question called and judgment went by default On Xs motion to vacate the diefault the Supreme Court of Iowa held that such facts were a suffi cient showing of unavoidable casualty and misfortune under  4091 of the Code providing for the vacation of judgments in case of unavoidable cas ualty and misfortune Notwithstanding the general rule that relief from a final judgment after the end of the term in which it was rendered can be had in the absence of motion for relief carried over the term as unfinished businessonly by bill for review or other appropriate new action the authority of the courts over regular judgments has in several of the states been extended beyond the term in certain cases specified by statutes or court rules differing too much in their terms to admit of statement of any general rule It was under such a statute that relief was granted in thei principal case In the majority of states notwithstanding these statutes the courts have steadily refused to set aside or vacate judgments because of the neglect misconduct or inadvertence of counsel employed in the case The general rule is that the neglect of the attorney is the neglect of the client and that no mistake inadvertence or neglect attributable to any attorney can be suc cessfully used as a ground for relief unless it would have been excusable if

Introduction On November 10 1856 Sir William R Hamilton presented before the Irish Academy a paper entitled  A new system of roots of unity   in which he pointed out the interesting fact that if si S2 represent two operators which obey the associative but not the commutative law of multiplication the three sets of three equations 812  2S3 s1s52 1 r  3 4 5 define the groups of movements of the regular polyhedrons The case when r  5 seems to have interested him especially and he denoted the resulting group in this special case by Icosian Calculus observing that all these results may be represented geometrically on the regular icosa hedron or on the regular dodecahedron About a quarter of a century later Dyck rediscovered the same results and put the whole matter in a somewhat clearer form from the standpoint of abstract groupst These relations are so simple and admit such a variety of geometric interpretations that they have become classic Two generalizations of these Hamiltonian relations were developed about a quarter of a century after the publications by Dyck or about half a century after Hamilton had started investigations in this direction In the earlier of these generalizations I the groups generated by si S2 when two of the three Hamiltonian relations are replaced by a single one without changing the third were investigated and the possible groups were deter mined It was assumed throughout this article that the generating oper ators were not commutative The special cases when these operators are commutative were considered incidentally in a later article  In the latter article a few errors relating to the first generalizations of the icosa hedral group were also corrected A second generalization of the given Hamiltonian relations appeared

Mathematics vol 41 1910 p 171 8 103104 G A MILLER in two articles The former of these was devoted to a second generalization of the relations defining the tetrahedral and the octahedral groups  while the latter confined itself to a second generalization of the icosahedral group t In these second generalizations the third Hamiltonian relation sls2r  1 was replaced by iS2  S2Slt while the other two relat ons were replaced by a single one just as in the first generalizations While only a small number of different groups involve two generators which satisfy the former of these generalized conditions there is always an in finite number of such groups when the latter generalized relations are assumed to be the only conditions impoted on the two generators The generalizations considered in the present paper are more direct than those previously considered as they are obtained from the Hamiltonian relations by omitting the condition that the given powers of s1 S2 SS2 are equal to unity That is we consider relations of the general type S12 S23  SlS2 r  3 4 5 Such relations are evidently equivalent to the two conditions S12  S23 s12  s1s2t and it will be proved that they are satisfied by the two gener ators of at least two and at most four groups for each value of r The simplicity of these results seems to justify the hope that they may find extensive applications It should perhaps be emphasized that the results here obtained are considerably simpler than those obtained from the other two generaliza tions that have been noted and hence the present paper has closer contact with the original developments by Hamilton than these earlier generaliza tions have The reason that the present generalizations were not developed first is that the writer did not foresee that they would lead to simple results and did not notice an easy approach to this problem when the other gener alizations were taken up The method employed in  2 is quite different from that used in the following sections This change is due to the fact that it was thought that the former method would give a deeper insight into the problem and the con siderations of  2 were sufficiently simple to employ a more general method of work than seemed feasible in the other sections where the considerations become more complex It may however be well to indicate here how to prove the main results of  2 by the more special methods employed later Starting with the equations S12  S2  SlS23 we observe at once that s1 S218s12 have a common square since si2 is invariant under the group G generated by si S2 Hence s1s21s18s2 is transformed into its inverse by s  American Journal of Mathematics vol 32 1910 p 65 t Quarterly Journal of Mathematics vol 41 1910 p 168GROUPS OF THE REGULAR POLYHE DRONS 105 according to the theorem If two operators have a common square the product of one and the inverse of the other is transformed into its inverse by each of these operators By means of the equations 81  iS2S182i82 S22  S812812S1 which are equivalent to the given conditional equations it is easy to verify the following relations s1S218F1822 8281222  82IS2381S22  S16 As s16 is both invariant under s1 and also transformed into its inverse by si its order divides 12 Hence the order of S2 must divide 18 and the order of G divides 72t After having proved that the order of G divides 72 whenever G is gener ated by two operators which satisfy the given conditions it is comparatively easy to determine the total number of groups which may be generated by two such operators and these details are given in the following section In a similar way it may be observed that when 13 S23  81S22 or S12  s281S2 S22  8182s1 the two operators S812 S2S have a common square and hence S18 28 1S2l12  816l18212S2 12  S6 g618s22S2 816812828I22  S81312828 12812  S13 Since S13 is invariant under 81S2 and also transformed into its inverse by 8182 the order of si divides 6 and the order of G divides 24 Hence it is again very easy to complete the determination of all the possible groups which can be generated by two operators satisfying the given conditions These special developments appear in the following section It may be added that if a set of conditions in the form of equations is given this set is always satisfied by the assumption that each of the operators is the identity This trivial special case is not generally mentioned in what follows as it is so evident and exists always Hence it must generally be assumed in the following theorems that at least one of the operators under consideration is not the identity This is so often done in group theory literature that it scarcely calls for justification in an article The types of alternative proofs suggested for the results of  2 may also be em ployed to prove many of the results of the following sections  Archiv der Mathematik und Physik vol 9 1905 p 6 t This upper limit of the order of G is a direct result of the well known theorem that two noncommutative operators s1 S2 which satisfy the equations 3S2  81823  1 must generate the tetrahedral group106 G A MILLER  2 Generalization of the tetrahedral group If the two noncommutative generators si s2 of a group G satisfy the conditions Si2  s23  SlS23 it results directly that the cyclic group generated by si is the central of G and that the quotient group of G with respect to its central the central quotient group of G is the tetrahedral group To the invariant subgroup of order 4 in this central quotient group there corresponds a subgroup of G whose operators of odd order are in its central and hence this subgroup is the direct product of a cyclic group of odd order and a group of order 2af We proceed to prove that the latter is either the four group or the quater nion group In fact this follows directly from the necessary property of this group that it involves three cyclic subgroups of order 2a1 which are conjugate under G It is well known that there are only two groups of order 2x which contain three cyclic subgroups of order 21 and that the groups of order 2a which contain more than one cyclic subgroup of order 2a1 are conformal with abelian groups whenever a  3 From the preceding paragraph it follows directly that the order of G cannot be divisible 16 whenever G is generated by Si S2 subject to the given conditions It is also easy to see that G cannot involve a subgroup of half its own order since such a subgroup would involve exactly half the operators of G which correspond to each operator in its central quotient group In particular this subgroup would involve half of the central of G but this half central could not involve the square of any operator corresponding to an operator of order 2 in the central quotient group and hence G cannot involve a subgroup of half its own order As there is only one group of order 24 which does not contain a sub group of order 12 it results from the preceding paragraph that G must be this nontwelve group of order 24 when the order of s1 is 4 From the properties of this group of order 24 it is clear that it can be generated by two operators of orders 4 and 6 respectively which satisfy the conditions imposed on Si and S2 That is when Si is of order 2 G is the tetrahedral group and when s8 is of order 4 G is the nontwelve group of order 24 We shall soon be able to prove that the order of G must divide 72 and that the two noncommutative operators si S2 must generate one of four groups when they satisfy the given conditions To establish this fact it is convenient to make use of a theorem which has very wide applications and may be stated as follows If Si S2  Sp is a complete set of conjugates in order under an operator t and if the continued product of this set of conjugates in order is the identity then will satP  tPGROUPS OF THE REGULAR POLYHEDRONS 107 where a is any one of the numbers 1 2  p Since tst  S1a  1 2  p  1 it results that sat  ts1 Hence sdtP  1 sa p where a  1 ya    are to be replaced by their least positive residues modulo p except that 0 is replaced by p From the fact that 81s2    sp  1 it results that SaL   Sa  1 and hence the theorem is proved It is clear that the given theorem remains true when the set s182  s repre sents more than one complete set of conjugates in order under t since the given proof does not depend upon the fact that the operators S1s2  Sp are distinct Other generalizations of the given theorem at once suggest themselves but for our present purpose it is convenient to leave it in the special form in which it has been stated It has been observed above that s may be regarded as the direct product of S23m and an operater s1 which is either of order 2 or of order 4 and that S2 transforms si into three conjugates S1 S2 S3 whose continued product is the identity when s1 is of order 2 since these three operators of order 2 and the identity constitute the four group This continued product must also be the identity when si is of order 4 since s1s 23 is of even order in this case Hence we have that Sl S2 S3  1 in all cases and if we combine this with the theorem of the preceding paragraph it results that the con ditions given at the beginning of this section may be replaced by S12 S2  S23  S5iS23S2 a  S2 9a3 HenceS29m  1 and as a and the order of S2 have only 2 or 1 as their highest common factor it results that S2  118 To prove that the order of S2 may be 18 it mayr be convenient to begin with the case when s1 s2 are commutative and hence the given conditions reduce to S12  S23  S13S23 From these conditions it results directly that s13  1 and hence S2  1 Moreover if S2 is an operator of order 9 and 1  S26 it is evident that s1 S2 satisfy the given conditions and generate the cyclic group of order 9 As it has been observed that s1 S may be so chosen that their orders are 4 and 6 respectively and that they generate the nontwelve group of order 24 it results directly that we may associate with these two noncommu tative operators two commutative ones ti t2 which are also commutative with s1 S2 of orders 3 and 9 respectively so that sit s2t2 are two operators of order 12 and 18 respectively which satisfy the given conditions In the same way we see that the orders of si S2 may be 6 and 9 respectively and hence there results the theorem If two noncommutative operators 81 S2 satisfy the two conditions S12  S23  s1s23 they must generate one of the following four groups the tetrahedral group the nontwelve group of order 24108 G A MILLER or the groups obtained by establishing a trisisomorphism between each of these groups and the cyclic group of order 9 When si S2 are commutative and satisfy these conditions they generate either the cyclic group of order 9 or the group of order 3 Closely related to the generalization considered above is the following Si3 S23  S1s22 That this does not lead to the same category as the set considered above is evident from the fact that if s1 S2 are commutative and satisfy these conditions they generate the group of order 3 while in the preceding case they could also generate the group of order 9 We shall again begin with the case when these generating operators are noncommutative and hence G is a group whose central quotient group is the tetrahedral group Just as in the preceding case we observe that when s1s2 is of order 2 or 4 G is the tetrahedral group or the nontwelve group of order 24 and that G cannot involve a subgroup of index 2 We proceed to prove that G must be one of these two groups when s  S2 are noncommutative and satisfy these conditions The subgroup of G which corresponds to the fourgroup in the central quotient group is the direct product of a group of odd order and either the fourgroup or the quaternion group for the same reasons as were given under the preceding conditions Hence we may assume that 8182  Ss13  where s is either of order 2 or 4 and is commutative with sl3ai Moreover a has at most the factor 2 in common with the order of si since siaG must generate the group of odd order in the central of G Hence the following equations S1S22  2516x  s1i s12a  56 On the other hand we have the equations S1 S1S2  SrS1 Si 3a S26  S16  Si6S18a in accord with the general theorem given above From these equations it results directly that S 2 4a  S 118 or S 6a  As the order of si cannot be divisible by 4 it results that the order of si divided 6 and hence the order of S2 is also a divisor of this number This  A trisisomorphism is one in which the invariant subgroups of index 3 are made to corre spond hence the order of the resulting group is onethird of the product of the orders of the iso morphic groups When the invariant subgroups of index 2 are made to correspond the isomor phism may be called a dimisomorphism Cf Cayley Quarterly Journal of Mathematics vol 25 11890 p 85GROUPS OF THE REGULAR POLYHEDRONS 109 proves that the order of 8182 is either 2 and 4 and completes the proof of the theorem If two noncommutative operators satisfy the conditions sl  S23  81822 they generate either the tetrahedral group or the nontwelve group of order 24 If two commutative operators satsify these conditions they generate the group of order 3 unless each of these operators is the identity In speaking of the finite group generated by operators subject to certain cond tions it is customary to think of the largest possible group which these operators can generate under these conditions If this were done in the present section the two theorems on the generalization of the tetrahedral group could be expressed as follows If two operators satisfy the conditions 813  823  81s22 they generate the nontwelve group of order 24 and if they satisfy the conditions 512  823  s8123 they generate the group of order 72 formed by establishing a trisisomorphism between this group of order 24 and the cyclic group of order 9 The theorems as stated above are however more definite as they include the cases when s1 82 do not generate the largest possible group subject to the given conditions  3 Generalizations of the octahedral group If the two noncommutative operators si 82 satisfy the two conditions S13  824  s8s82 the two operators s2  51j12251 have a common square and hence the product of one of these into the inverse of the other is transformed into its inverse by each of these operators We may therefore endeavor to find an upper limit of the order of the group G generated by s  82 by finding a power of this product such that this power is invariant under G From the fact that this power is both transformed into its inverse and is also invariant under the same operator it results directly that its order cannot exceed 2 The actual work may be performed as follows From the given relations it results directly that 818281  823 and 828182  812 Hence it is not difficult to derive the following relations 82 S1 82 81  82 S1

the given con110 G A MILLER ditions are satisfied and hence the order of G cannot exceed 48 More over it is easy to see that the nontwelve group of order 24 can be extended by means of an operator of order 4 so as to obtain a group of order 48 which may be generated by two operators satisfying the given condition Hence the theorem If two noncommutative operators fulfil the condition S13  S 24 S1s22 they generate either the octahedral group or a group of order 48 known as G5 If two commutative operators satisfy these conditions they evidently generate the group of order 2 If two noncommutative operators satisfy the two conditions 82  S24  sls23 or S1  S281828182 S23  S182818281 the two operators s22 S 15S22S1 have again a common square and hence we shall consider the reduced form of s22S515s2 2 as follows S22S 1s2 2S 1 2  822S1 ls2 2S1s22S 18s2 2S  S22S118s218 lsl2sls23s 11s2281  S22S1 81s2 81 s2S2s182s18S1  S22S1S2 181s22s1s2 181  822512S2s1s23818218l  81s 2s23s3s2 4  S110 Hence it results that the order of si is a divisor of 20 and that the order of G divides 240 If s1 is actually of order 20 the order of S2 must be 40 and S 15 815 satisfy the given relations These operators must therefore generate G52 and G must be the direct product of this G52 and the group of order 5 On the other hand if the order of si is 10 the given conditions are again satisfied and G must be the direct product of the octahedral group and the group of order 5 If S1 S2 are commutative and satisfy the given conditions they clearly generate either the group of order 5 or the cyclic group of order 10 Hence the theorem If two noncommutative operators satisfy the conditions S12  S24  SlS23 they generate one of the following four groups the octahedral group G52 or the direct product of one of these groups and the group of order 5 Wrhen two commutative operators satisfy these conditions they generate the group of order 2 or of order 5 or the cyclic group of order 10 The third and last generalization of the octahedral group to be consid ered in this connection is given by the equations S12  S23  SIS2 4 From these equations we easily deduce an equivalent system as

operators 821 S27 clearly satisfy the conditions imposed on si S2 and hence Si2l S27 G52 The same operators clearly generate the octahedral group when the order of s is 14 From these results we

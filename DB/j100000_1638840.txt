that the mind should work chiefly extensively The point at which one method of thinking passes over into the other would be hard to trace One can do extensive thinking in school and must do intensive work after assuming the work of life None the less generally speaking I believe that the training of young manhood looks to the extension of thought in maturer life You are not pri marily going on to get facts out of books and out of the laboratory and out of the experience of others into your mind You are to begin to take the facts which that mind has digested and to work them out into useful forms and into productive serv ice You have been perhaps the benefi ciaries hitherto of the things which have been created and of the thoughts which others have worked out in the crucible of their own mental processes You are now to become in a sense creators and to think both for yourselves and others You have been one may say absorbers you are to be come producers Your value as men de pends on what the product shall be The country is not so greatly concerned I venture to believe with the amount that a man knows as it is with the use he makes of what he knows It does not want the man who while his body may live still keeps his mind in a mental churchyard One of the great phrases of the Old Testa ment says Thou hast taken me and Thou hast set me in a large place  and what the world needs is men who can think in great areas It is necessary but it is not sufficient to get the facts One who would do a mans job in the world must through those facts serve his fellows Think if you please what the symmetry of life should be It should not be narrow it should not be crooked It should be straight and square It should be high to keep out of the dust and mire It should be broad that it may rest securely It should be deep based on the eternal verities It must not be low for living things grow upward into the light I would have you question all your life long whether this or that or the other form of alleged truth which is presented to you be so or not If it is found not to be the truth I would have you reject it without regret and without fear of inconsistency for there is some force in the statement that consistency is the virtue of weak minds Truth is pro gressively revealed and one must readjust himself in thought and action to the greater knowledge of truth that we ought contin ually to gain The man who at fifty thinks as he thought at thirty has mentally ceased to grow If ones mind is open to the light whencesoeer it may fall if ones steps are guided by that light whither soeer it may lead there is little to fear either as to treading the path safely or as to the place in the world to which it shall conduct one WILLIAM C REDFIELD MINERAL PRODUCTION IN 1915  TE midyear finds the mineral industries of the United States generally prosperous and enjoying a revival of active development With this statement the director of the United States Geological Survey opens an official re view of mining conditions as reported to him by the government geologists and statisticians working on this subject  This revival is par ticularly true of some of the metals for which increased demands have been noted during the past six months This country has been first thrown upon its own resources for mineral products required and next given the oppor tunity to supply the needs of foreign countries who have offered us their trade Comparative freedom from foreign competition and in some important cases increase of foreign markets 46 SCIENCEJULY 9 1915 SCIENCE have stimulated production and a general mining advance has set in Summarizing the special reports at hand Director Smith continues his review The six months record in iron is reassuring in that hopes at the beginning of the year have been realized Ore shipments from the Lake Superior mines have begun well May 1915 showing a 30 per cent increase over May 1914 The pig iron output is also promising in its steady increase month by month so that a reasonable prophecy is for a greater total pig iron production for 1915 than for last year Enlargement and extensions at the iron and steel plants furnish unmistakable evidence of returning business confidence The half year period just completed has wit nessed great changes in the copper industry and in every particular the improvement has been notable Prices output and wages have shown an upward trend and prosperity is the word in the copper districts of the United States The demand for spelter and lead with the present Aigh prices have given a double im petus to mining in the zinclead districts In the Joplin region old mines are being reopened new shafts are being sunk and prospecting is most active Smelters are pushed to capac ity operation The six months period has been altogether favorable for zinc mines and smelters and the June advance in the price of lead makes the outlook bright for all lead mining In the minor metals the first American mine to be extensively operated for molybde nite has been opened in Colorado a tin smelter is reported as being built in New Jersey and the Colorado tungsten mines are working full handed on full time an antimony smelter in California has resumed operations and a new one has been erected in the same state to work California ores and antimony ores have been shipped from Nevada and Alaska The de mand for quicksilver has increased with the result that the California Nevada and Texas producers are expected to work at top capacity An unusual feature affecting coal mining has been the loss of bunker trade at the At lantic ports which is only partially offset by increasing exports Reports from the west on the other hand show an increase in coal pro duction over last year and in the east the coke output has increased considerably of late thus showing at last the effect of the recent activity in iron and other metals The petroleum production for the six months just closed is believed to exceed that for the corresponding period last year Un fortunately for the producers this increase has not been in response to a demand expressed in higher prices On the contrary the per sistent flood of oil from the Oklahoma fields and from the new pools in Louisiana and Texas has prevented any permanent advance in price Reports from the surveys western offices are in the main optimistic Colorado already shows an increase in gold output over the same period in normal years and while the six months has shown no increase in tonnage for other ores there has been a large increase in value and the present high prices give the promise of increased mining activity during the rest of the year Utah is expected to reach a record output and Nevada mines are being operated at usual capacity with new activity on the old Comstock The lead and silver production of Idaho has only recently been stimulated but a large increase in zinc output has already been shown In Montana the copper mines have about reached normal con dition the zinc production already shows a notable increase and the gold output will be larger New Mexico reports increases in gold silver and zinc while lead production has fallen off The six months output of copper in New Mexico was probably equal to onehalf last years output so that there is good expec tation of a better total for the year Arizona as a copper state has shown the usual im provement during the six months while the gold mines promise a recordbreaking year No large increase in Arizonas output of lead or zinc is expected in 1915 over other years In California some gain in gold yield is re ported and copper conditions are much im proved over last year Oregon shows a slight 47N S VOL XLII No 1071 increase in gold output while in Alaska the outlook is good for increased output of copper as well as gold More Alaska mines are on a producing basis this year and more dredges are in operation THE PACIFIC COAST MEETING OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION Times and Places of MeetingThe opening session of the Pacific Coast meeting of the American Association for the presentation of the addresses of welcome and the response thereto

part by Messrs Davis Metealf Morse and some other assistants E E Watson student in Iowa Univer sity was engaged in biometrit studies of various loeal trabs Chas B Wilson AM professor of biol ogy State Normal School Westfield Mass carried on studies of paraslitit copepods both living and preserved material being used Many interesting facts relating to the ecology of these parasites some of pos sible economic value were discovered In a number of cases the life history was traGed partially or completely A consid erable number of new species were found Professor Wilson likewise prepared an ex tensive set of reeords of loeal parasitie copepods for ineorporation into the faunal catalogue Commissioner G M Bowers Dr B WS Evermann ehief of the Division of Scien tifie Inquiry and Mr E I

longitude we remained in the Hum boldt current as we could readily see from the character of the temperature serials and from the amount of pelagic life we obtained from both the surfate and the intermediate hauls This eurrent also aM feleted the bottom fauna which was fairly rich even as far as 800 miles from the shore while we remained within the limits of the northern current As soon as we ran out side of this the character of the surfaee fauna changedl 7 it became less and less abundant as we made our way to Easter Island the western half of the line from Callao becoming gradually barren This current also affected the deepsea fauna to such an estent that towards Easter Island at a distanee of 1200 to 1400 miles from the South Ameriean eontinent our trawl hauls were absolutely barren the bottom for the greater part of the line was covered with manganese nodules on which were found attached a few insignifieant siliceous sponges an oceasional ophiuran and a few brachiopods or diminutive worm tubes the same bottom continuing to Sala y Gomez and between there and Easter Island Sala y Gomez and Easter Island are eonnected by a ridge on whieh we found 1142 fath oms near Sala y Gomez and 1696 fathoms between that point and Easter Island The ridge rises rapidly from about 2000 fath oms the general oeeanic depth within about  Extract from a letter of Mr Ale2iander Agassiz to

y Gomez and Easter Island The southern part o our line from Easter Islnd to the Galapagos shows all the features characteristic of the western part of the line from Callao to Easter Island like the latter as far as the twelfth degree of southern latitude it proved com paratively barren the bottom onsisting of manganese nodules to within about 250 miles of the GSalapagos The pelagic and intermediate fauna from Ea4er Island to 12 south latitude was very poor and the serial temperatures show that we were out side atLd to the westward of the great Hum boldt current But near the twelfth degree of southern latitude a sudden change took plaee the pelagic and intermediate faufna became quite abundant again and soon fully as rich ast at any time in the HUEL boldt current There was also a marked  change in the temperature of the water as indicated by the serials showing that frorn the twelMth degree of southern latitllde to the Galapagos we were cutting across the western part of the Humboldt current The great ehanges of temperature which took place in the layers of the water be tween 50 and 300 fatPolns are most sltrik ing and show what a disturbing element the great mass of cold water fowing north must be in the equatorial regions of the Panamic district to the south and to the north of the Galapagos South of the GSalapagos the western flow of the Hum boldet current must be nearly 900 miles wide and of about the sarne width when running parallel to the South American coast The range of temperatures between 30 fathoms and 150 fathomas is at some point as great as 21 Such extremes can not fail to afeetth dlstributson of the pelagic faurva and may aceot or the mass of dead material often collected in the inter mediate tows at depths of less than 300 fathoms when the range betomes as great as 28 Such a range of temperatur is far greater thalL that of the isoerymie lilles whith separate coast faunal divisions The bottom faun a we entered the Humboldt current going Borth gradually became richer in spite of its being covered with manganese nodules The two lines centering at Eater Istand developed the Alhatross Platean indicated on the Challenger bathymetrical charts on the strength of a few soundings reaehing from Callao in a northwesterly direction and of a couple of soundings on the twen tieth degree of latitude The Albatross Plateau is marked as a broad ridge sep arating the Buchan Basin from the deep basin to the westward of which Grey Deep and Moser Basin are the most noted areas Our line flrom Easter Island to the GSala pagos showed a wonderfully level ridge varying in depth only from 2020 to 2265 fathoms in a distance o nearly 2000 miles The soundings we made to the eastward from the Galspagos to the 23outh American coast and to the westward of Callao as well as on the line from Callao to Easter Island all indicate a grazdual deepenilg to the eastward to orm what the Chalexger has ca31ed the E3uehan Basin with greatest delths of 2400 to

Challenger soundings the Juan Fernandez PXlateau connects with the Albatlnoss Plateau and forms the southern limit separating lXuchan Basin from the Barker Ban to the south of the Juan Fernandez

we eould seareely have gone along side for this purpose Considerable shore eolleeting was done at Easter Island We Inust have brought together at least thirty speeiess of plants The flora of Easter

THE task undertaken in this paper is to show with especial reference to the United States what changes in cotton manufacturing machinery have taken place since our Civil War In the last half of the eighteenth century the technique of cotton manufacturing was revolutionized by the great English inventors But their inventions remarkable as they were were only the beginnings of a series of improvements which have continued to the present time What have the Ameri 1 The material for this paper has been obtained through visits to a number of cotton mills and from interviews and correspondence with cotton manufacturers and machine manufacturers In addition many works of a more or less technical character have been consulted For tracing the history of the different machines the Transactions of the New England Cotton Manufacturers Association later the National Associa tion of Cotton Manufacturers have been especially useful The following are the other more important works of which use has been made Cyclopedia of Textile Work Chicago 1907 This gives a detailed description of the machinery and methods used in the various branches of the textile industry G 0 Draper

contributed to this development How far have their contributions been the result of conditions peculiar to this country On the answer to these questions depend to some extent our conclu sions as to the stability of the basis on which our cotton manufacturing industry stands In the United States labor has always been the most expensive factor in the cost of production Hence if a manufacturing industry is to succeed in this country it must be through the introduction of laborsaving machinery More over during the last fifty years the most available supply of labor has been that furnished by the foreign immigrants Those machines which require little skill and whose management can be easily learned make possible the utilization of labor of this class Let us see then how the American cotton manufacturers have met the industrial conditions imposed upon them For convenience and greater clearness I will discuss the subject under five heads 1 preparatory pro cesses opening carding combing

process is opening and picking After the cotton from a number of bales has been mixed centres of the United States Comparisons are frequently made between English and American methods WV Whittam Jr Report on Englands Cotton Industry Washington 1908 As a special agent of the United States Government Mr Whittam made a careful inves tigation of the English cotton industry the results of which are

the evidence are found occasional references to machinery and methods S H Higgins Dyeing in Germany and America Manchester 1907 The author of this book personally inspected various dyeing plants in

separated and the dirt shaken out From the finisher picker the cotton issues in the form of a lap ready for the card The card removes whatever dirt remains at the same time straightening out the fibres As the rope of cotton called  sliver about the size of a mans thumb comes from the card it is coiled mechanically in a can If the cotton is to be used for spinning fine yarn or hosiery yarn it is next combed But for ordinary purposes the cans of sliver are taken directly to the drawing frame where several ends usually six are drawn into one by means of two sets of rollers revolv ing at different rates of speed All the processes up to this point are designed partly to clean the cotton but more especially to secure greater evenness in length and weight While they are adjusted somewhat differently according to the grade of work desired the object is the same throughout a continual re doubling and drawing out The fly frames receive the cotton next and here the twisting of the sliver begins There are always three sets and in some mills four sets of these fly frames the slubber intermediate jack and roving frames These machines tho called by various names in different mills or in different sections are the same in principle Each succeeding frame draws out the cotton into a finer thread and puts in more twist From the last of the fly frames the cotton goes to the machine on which the spinning is done either a mule or a ring frame The weft yarn is ready for the loom as soon as spun But the warp yarn that which is to form the threads lengthwise of the cloth must be spooled warped and112 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS sized On the spooler the yarn from several bobbins is wound onto spools for convenience in warping A number of these spools are placed on a large frame called a creel whence the yarn is rewound onto the beam of the warper This beam a small roller varies in length with the number of ends which are to be wound upon it The number of ends in turn varies according to the width of cloth to be made The beam when filled is carried to the slasher where the yarn is sized being run through a solution of starch China clay tallow flour and other ingredients vary ing according to the particular formula of each mill After this treatment the ends of the sized warp yarn are drawn into the harnesses of the loom on which the cloth is woven For converting and finishing the cloth there is a variety of methods and consequently a variety of machines There are the machines used in dyeing bleaching and printing and loop cutters shearers brushes calendars as well as machines used in inspecting folding and packing Such are the main processes through which the cotton passes from the time it leaves the bale till it is ready to be shipped to the jobber or retailer In all of these processes more or less improvement has been made during the last fifty years I PREPARATORY PROCESSES OPENING CARDING COMBING DRAWING The machines of this group loosen the matted cotton of the bale remove the dirt and shorter fibres straighten and lay parallel the other fibres and draw them out into a finer and finer thread of even weight The object is uniformity in length of staple and in weight of lap and sliverCOTTON MANUFACTURING SINCE 1860 113 In the machinery used for the initial processes the chief changes have been in the direction of perfecting machines already used in 1860 The bale breaker has come into more general use so that in the United States at least hand labor is no longer used in loosen ing up the cotton after the bale has been opened The heavy laps of cotton are thrown from the bale directly into the bale breaker Altho the method of carry ing the cotton from this machine to the next has been improved it still varies widely in different mills In a few mills the cotton is delivered automatically into bins and thence fed by hand into the opener or the automatic feeder But the use of machines for feed ing the cotton directly to the automatic feeder is be coming more general For this purpose blowers are used to transport the cotton from the room in which the bales are opened to the room in which the openers are located The blower consists of a large pipe through which the cotton is forced by fans At the present time as a result of improvements cotton in some plants is blown a thousand feet by this means The economies of this method of transportation are two In the first place the bale breaker can be put in a separate building whereby the danger of fire is lessened no cotton being stored in the mill proper In the second place cotton from several bale breakers can be fed into the same pipe and a better mixture obtained For delivering the cotton directly to the automatic feeder or the opener several machines have been de vised Of these the Morton Automatic Distributor is probably the most economical This machine a recent American invention consists of a steel trough extending over the feeders Into this trough the cotton is delivered from the blower The bottom of114 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS the trough is a travelling apron and on the side over the hoppers of the feeders are gates When a hopper is nearly empty the gate in the trough above opens automatically permitting the cotton to run out till the hopper is refilled Then the gate closes automati cally and the cotton in the distributor passes on till it comes to the next open gate This machine saves floor space since no bins are required and no cotton is piled on the floor behind the openers It also saves labor since after the cotton is fed into the bale breaker it does not have to be handled again till it has come from the breaker picker The cotton is fed automatically from the opener to the first or breaker picker If the openers and pickers are in the same room a combination machine is com monly used Otherwise the cotton is carried from the opener to the picker by a blower or a trunk The machinery varies widely between different mills ac cording to the arrangement of the plant or the pre judice of the superintendent But the principles are the same After the cotton comes from the breaker picker it is passed as a rule through an intermediate and a finisher picker tho in some mills only the breaker and finisher pickers are used These ma chines both openers and pickers have been greatly improved since 1860 But the English manufacturers have led the way the American manufacturers having accepted the improvements made in England The machines in use in the two countries are very similar and are run at practically the same speeds The English have also taken the lead in improving the card They have in fact brought about a revo lution in carding since our Civil War by the introduc tion of the revolving flat card The stationary flat card had been improved in the fifties by WellmanCOTTON MANUFACTURING SINCE 1860 115 an American who introduced a device for automati cally stripping the flats1 This type of card came into general use immediately after the war in those American mills which had not adopted it previously But about the same time the English manufacturers were developing the revolving flat card On this card the flats are arranged to move in a sort of endless chain part of them at work and part exposed to be cleaned It is built entirely of steel whereas the frame of the Wellman card was wooden The steel construction makes possible more accurate adjust ment the card can now be set to one thousandths of an inch and adjusted minutely to the grade of work desired It also can be more easily cleaned and more easily and more accurately ground and less floor space is required But of especial interest to us is the fact that the output both per machine and per operative is greater The principle of this revolving flat card is said to have been known since 18342 but it was not taken up till 18573 The first revolving flat cards were then introduced in England and after the  cotton famine  soon replaced the old roller and clearer cards Even before 1867 some revolving flat cards were imported into the United States4 and in 1883 a card of this type was first made in this country Yet it was not till after 1885 that the rapid replace ment of the stationary flat cards began By the pre sent time however the few remnants of the old style cards in our mills are being thrown out The improvement of carding machinery by the English manufacturers is significant of the attention l R Cowley History of Lowell p 145 2 Twelfth Census vol ix p 43 3 Idem 4 New England Cotton Manufacturers Association Transactions No 3 1867 p 21116 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS which they have always given to the introductory processes the same attention which resulted in the improvements in opening and picking machinery This characteristic was shown early in the nineteenth century for Montgomery in 1840 commented on the better carding in English mills And very recently Mr Whittam notes a similar difference2 The greater waste in carding in American mills is explained by the extra labor cost of preventing this waste The American manufacturers economize in labor rather than in raw cotton and in order to obtain the maxi mum output per operative push their machinery harder thus impairing the quality of the work per haps and causing more waste In the main however there is no great difference in the machines or in the speed at which they are run in the two countries The improvements have been made in England but they have been adopted in the United States And the saving has probably been greater for the American manufacturer inasmuch as the reduction of the labor cost of carding if relatively the same in the two coun tries must have been greater absolutely in our mills Further these cards require little skill on the part of the operative except for the few grinders necessary and consequently the immigrant can be used for this work The revolving flat card therefore is adapted to the conditions both in the United States and Eng land As might be expected we find practically no differences in the method of carding The comber was invented in France by Heilmann in 18453 Later it was improved by the English manufacturers Its use in American mills has been I J Montgomery Cotton Manufacture p 32 2 W Whittam Jr Report on Englands Cotton Industry p 19 3 J Zipser Textile Raw Materials and their Conversion into Yarn p 169COTTON MANUFACTURING SINCE 1860 117 very limited until recent years This limitation was due to the fact that the comber which separates the long fibres and combs out the short ones so that the staple can be spun to greater fineness or with looser twist is employed only in the manufacture of fine yarns or hosiery yarns Since the recent develop ment of the production of these yarns with the rise of the knit goods industry and the increase in the out put of fine cloth more combers have been installed Up to 1897 all combers in American mills were im ported In that year however an American cotton machinery firm introduced a new and improved comber About the same time similar improvements were made in England and in Germany2 showing that other cotton manufacturing countries were feeling the need of reducing the cost of producing combed yarn The principle of all of these new combers was that of the Heilmann the differences being in details In the American comber to take this for illustration the speed was increased from 85 and 90 nips per minute to 130 and 135 nips per minute the number of heads per machine from six to eight and the width of the lap from 813a inches to 12 inches Moreover the quality of the work was not impaired The effect of these improvements has been to cut in two the labor cost of combing doubling the output per operative The saving on the English or Nasmith comber and on the German combers the Montfort and Alsatienne has been equally great In fact many American manu facturers prefer the foreign made combers and use them in their mills This preference may be due in I National Association of Cotton Manufacturers Transactions No 82 p 340 2 New England Cotton Manufacturers Association Transactions No 69 pp 342346 No 78 pp 183194 No 82 p 342 3 Ibid No 82 p 344118 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS part to prejudice but very likely to more careful con struction of the foreign machines whereby the higher initial cost resulting from the import duty is counter balanced The economy in labor is about the same in either case and as in carding the saving has been absolutely greater for the American manufacturer Combers are not in general use in this country however since the use of the comber necessitates several additional handlings Not only must the cotton be combed but the sliver from the card must first be transformed into a lap on the sliver lapper to prepare it for the comber After it has been combed it must be changed back to a sliver for the drawing frame Each of these processes enables greater doubl ing and drawing whereby the uniformity is improved but the extra labor involved still causes a considerable increase in the labor cost This is an important rea son for the greater cost of manufacturing fine yarns and knitting yarns None the less the improvements in the comber have promoted the manufacture of fine goods and of knit goods in the United States Since 1860 no change has been made in the drawing frame except to improve its construction The rail way head which collects the slivers from several drawing heads and draws them into a single sliver has however been abandoned by most American manufacturers Some mills now employ only a single process of drawing And where two sets of drawing frames and a railway head were formerly used the American manufacturers have adopted the English practice of using three sets of drawing frames since the machinery is simpler and more easily regulated Not only has the construction of the drawing frame been made more accurate but its efficiency has also 1 New England Cotton Manufacturers Association Transactions No 71 p 259COTTON MANUFACTURING SINCE 1860 119 been increased by improvements in the stop motions which were in use before 1860 Now the machine stops if the back sliver breaks if the front sliver breaks or when the can is full The electric stop motion which has come into general use is the most impor tant of the innovations The result has been to enable the operative to tend more machines thus reducing the labor cost and to turn out product of better quality The fly frames of the present are also similar to those of 1860 except that they are longer and better constructed The lengthening of the frame has made it possible for the operative to tend more spindles But of more importance  in fact the thing which has made feasible the greater length of the frames  has been the perfecting of the machine Roller bear ings have been introduced and the construction im proved throughout Moreover since 1875 electricity has been applied to the stop motions of the fly frames producing economies similar to those from its use on the stop motions of the card and drawing frame For the perfecting of these fly frames the cotton manu facturing world is largely indebted to the English manufacturers It is true that some improvements have been made in this country as for example that recently introduced by a Boston firm whereby the arm of the flyer is changed so as to increase the out put per spindle But in the main the changes have been introduced from England Yet the fly frames in American mills are fully as good as those in English mills In fact many Englishmade fly frames are to be found in American mills As between the two countries the machines are similar and run at about the same speeds The improvements have however 1 Centennial Exhibition 1876 Reports and Awards vol iii Group 8 p 19120 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS been of especial advantage to the American manu facturer For the labor cost has been greatly lessened by increasing the output per machine and per opera tive In one prosperous New England mill for ex ample the average earnings per slubbertender have increased eightyfive per cent since 1880 At the same time the saving to the mill has been at least equally great There has been a similar saving on the other fly frames Undoubtedly the saving has been not so great in some mills and perhaps greater in others But at any rate it shows the tendency toward reduc tion in labor cost From this survey of the processes introductory to spinning it appears that there are few differences in the machinery used in England and in the United States and that manufacturers in the latter country have on the whole followed in the steps of their foreign competitors In fact in all these processes except opening and picking there are many English made machines in use in this country The readiness with which these inventions have been adopted in this country show how well they were adapted to the con ditions in both countries Furthermore their intro duction has brought fully as great savings to the manufacturers in the United States by the reduction in the labor cost The cumulative effect on the quality of the work has also been important For as the elementary processes are improved it becomes possible to produce better results in the succeeding processes The cotton is better prepared for the next machine and hence its work is facilitated The question may well be raised how it happens that the English have taken the initiative in perfect ing these machines since the changes have been at least equally important to the American cotton manuCOTTON MANUFACTURING SINCE 1860 121 facturers The explanation must be that they have felt more pressure at these points than have the Ameri can manufacturers The necessity of economizing in raw cotton may have had some influence there is less waste on the improved machines But the chief cause has been the development of fine spinning in England As other countries have established cotton mills which have competed in the coarse and medium grades of goods the English manufacturers have turned to the manufacture of finer and finer grades In order to spin fine yarns it is necessary to exercise great care in the preparation of the cotton This has led to the perfecting of the machinery for these pro cesses On the other hand in the United States the manufacture of fine goods has begun to develop only recently Consequently the American manufacturers have been content to adopt the improvements intro duced by their English rivals And in the manufac ture of coarse goods they have received as much if not greater benefit II SPINNING Spinning is the twisting together firmly of the fibres of cotton to form yarn In the previous processes only enough twist has been put in to make the fibres hold together while being doubled and drawn At this stage the cotton is made into a firm compact thread If the American manufacturers 1 have shown little independence in improving the machines for the pre paratory processes the story for all the later processes 1 By  American manufacturers  are meant both the cotton manufacturers proper and the machine manufacturers In many instances the machine manufacturers in troduce improvements or invent new machines But these are not a success till they have been accepted by the mills Not infrequently some person connected with the mill originates an important improvement Hence the term is used in a general sense122 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS is quite different Here they have introduced new types of machines which to a certain extent are pecu liar to this country This characteristic is manifested to as great an extent in spinning machinery as in any There are two types of spinning machines the mule and the ring frame The former is of English parent age and descent The latter is an American product As the machines are different in principle it may be well to give a brief description of each First as to the mule The bobbins of rove as they come from the roving frame are placed in rows on top of the machine Then the ends of cotton are drawn through sets of rollers geared so as to revolve at dif ferent rates of speed and thus draw out the thread From the rollers the thread of cotton passes to the spindles which are mounted on a carriage This carriage runs on an iron track and as the rollers re volve the carriage backs away at a speed great enough to draw out the threads still more After the carriage has withdrawn to a distance of about sixty three inches it stops During this outward move ment the spindles are stationary But when the carriage stops they begin to revolve thus spinning the yarn that is twisting it As the carriage returns the yarn is wound on to the spindle to form the cone shaped cop the process of building being regulated by the faller wire a device which moves up and down to guide the yarn In the meantime the rollers have been inactive since they stop when the carriage stops and do not begin to revolve again till the carriage starts out once more The mule was invented in England in the eighteenth century At first it was 1 A good brief description but more in detail than that given here can be found in J Zipser Textile Raw Materials pp 184200 Similar descriptions are to be found in other technical booksCOTTON MANUFACTURING SINCE 1860 123 operated by hand but about 1825 the selfactor was introduced Since then minor changes for example the adoption of the self centering principle for the spindle in 18851 have been made The mule has from the first been a very complex machine few in any industry are more complex The ring frame is less complicated It consists of sets of rollers similar to those in the mule for draw ing out the rove But the spindles are directly under neath Around each spindle is a steel ring There are at least one hundred and twenty eight spindles per machine and all the rings in each machine are fixed in a single frame On each ring is a little wire called a traveller through which the thread passes to the bobbin on the spindle As the spindle revolves this traveller is drawn around the ring receiving its impetus from the yarn Thus it revolves a little more slowly than the bobbin whereby the twist is put into the yarn At the same time the yarn is wound onto the bobbin and in order to secure uniformity in wind ing the frame of rings moves up and down slowly The ring frame was invented by an American in 1831 but it did not at once replace the mule In fact in 1860 the number of mule spindles and the number of ring spindles in use in the United States were still about equal With the close of the Civil War the American manufacturers turned their attention to the improvement of spinning machinery with the result that in the early seventies several improvements were made in the ring spindle In these improve ments Sawyer and Rabbeth were foremost altho other inventors soon added their contributions2 Several I Eleventh Census vol VII p 170 2 For an account of the development of the ring spindle see the address by W F Draper on  The History of Spindles  in Transactions of the New England Cotton Manufacturers Association No 50 pp 1346 A good summary is also given by G 0 Draper in Textile Texts 2nd ed pp 141154124 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS of the improvements were combined and the whole construction of the machine perfected The spindle was reduced in weight and its point of support was changed to an elevated bolster By these changes and improvements the power cost was reduced the speed increased and the quality of the work improved The limit of production on the ring spindle is the speed of rotation Before these improvements were intro duced the average speed was 5500 turns per minute although higher speeds were attained even before 18601 By 1875 the average speed had been increased to 7500 revolutions and soon after it was further increased to 10000 revolutions per minute At the present time while the average speed is still 10000 revolutions on fine yarns it sometimes is as high as 12000 or 13000 revolutions2 The speed is now limited by the rapidity with which the operative can make good piecings and especially by the tendency of the traveller to fly off if the spindle revolves at a speed much over 10000 turns per minute These higher speeds require no more power than was em ployed to drive the old spindle at the lower speed The work is better and the output per spindle greater The length of the frame has been increased and the spinner can care for more spindles As a result the output per spinner has been at least doubled There are essential differences not only in princi ple but also in operation between the ring frame and the mule On the same grade of goods the speeds of the ring spindle and of the mule spindle are about 1 Baird stated in 1851 that the ring spindle  may be driven at a speed of 9000 revolutions per minute with perfect security when making coarse yarn and when operating upon the finer numbers 10000 revolutions per minute is not an extraordi nary speed to be attained BairdAmerican Cotton Spinner p 155 Other ac counts do not seem to fully justify this statement and the average speed then was probably considerably less 2 Textile World Record vol xxii p 81COTTON MANUFACTURING SINCE 1860 125 equal But the product is greater on the former since it spins continuously whereas the latter spins intermittently Altho the number of spindles per machine is sometimes greater on the mule the dif ference in the output per spindle more than offsets this Again the yarn spun on the ring spindle is subject to greater strain from continually dragging around the traveller Yet this strain is constant The strain on the yarn is not so great on the mule since the spinning ceases while the yarn is being wound onto the cop but the strain is less regular and breaks are therefore more frequent The constant strain of the traveller on the ring frame tends to make the yarn harder On the mule the yarn is softer since the amount of twist can be more easily regulated and made slacker if desired The harder ringspun yarn is better adapted for the warp than for the weft In fact it was at first used only for warp yarn But im provements making possible the spinning of softer yarn have resulted in the spinning of filling also on the ring frame Yet even now some manufacturers especially the English maintain that they produce cloth with a superior  clothy  feeling by using mule spun yarn Other manufacturers declare that they can produce equally good cloth with ring spun yarn However that may be it seems probable that other factors have more to do in determining which method of spinning shall be used than the feeling of the pro duct The slacker twisted mule yarn is better adapted to taking a heavy size It is not twisted as hard and its diameter is greater for the same count Thus it will absorb more sizing and presents a greater surface for the size to adhere to Hence it is preferred for warp yarn in the manufacture of certain grades of coarse goods Furthermore it has a decided advan126 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS tage in the spinning of fine numbers since the greater strain on the ring frame militates against its use in spinning fine yarn It is to be said however that the improvements in the ring frame have lessened the strain and finer and finer numbers are being spun upon it1 so that in this country the ring spindle is now employed to spin the warp yarn even in those mills which still use mule spun weft There are still other differences On the ring frame wooden bobbins must be used while on the mule the yarn is wound on a little paper cop or on the bare spindle The mule does not require doffing that is the removal of the yarn from the spindles as fre quently as the ring frame since the cops hold more yarn This enables a saving of time in doffing the mule Furthermore if the yarn is to be shipped out of the mill the freight charge on the wooden bobbins is to be reckoned with One writer estimates that while the cost of carrying mule cops is ten per cent of the freight charge on the yarn the relative freight expense for the wooden bobbins is two hundred per cent2 It costs more to carry the bobbin than to carry the yarn which it contains Moreover the bobbins must be returned This is an extra expense and there is the possibility of their complete loss especially if the yarn is exported to another country To be sure much of the warp yarn is shipped in the form of spools skeins beams or cones but the filling is shipped on bobbins or cops The difference in complexity is also important The simpler ring frame is less liable to breakdown and consequent loss of time It is more easily re 1 Several mills are spinning as fine as 120s and even finer on the ring frame The ring had an advantage here in that the speed is greater than on the coarser counts 2 J Lister Cotton Manufacture p 51COTTON MANUFACTURING SINCE 1860 127 paired in case of accident The greater complexity of the mule necessitates more care on the part of the operative and the more frequent breaks in the yarn require greater attention and more skill in piecing As a result men are always employed as mule spinners The danger which a womans skirts would entail is another factor preventing the employment of women as mule spinners On the ring frame on the con trary the necessary knowledge can be acquired in a short time Little skill is required and the spinners are usually women or children For social reasons it may be preferable to have men rather than women and children employed in the cotton mills But from the manufacturers point of view it is often desirable to employ women and children so far as possible There are still other advantages which the ring frame possesses as for example the requirement of less floor space and the greater facility in lubrication But the most important differences between the ring and the mule to sum up  are those in complexity in the use of bobbins and cops and in the yarn itself It is by reference to these most important differences that we can explain why it is that the ring has been adopted to a far greater extent in the United States than in England As already stated the ring spindle is an American invention It has been perfected by Americans and it has been most widely adopted by the American manufacturers The attention which it has received is shown by the number of patents taken out on ring spindles in the United States no less than three hundred and seventythree between 1870 and 19031 As a result of the improvements the ring frame has almost entirely superseded the mule in this country 1 G 0 Draper Textile Texts 2nd ed p 142128 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS except for the spinning of fine yarns and hosiery yarns In 1870 the number of ring spindles was but slightly greater than the number of mule spindles Since that time however almost the entire increase has been in the number of ring spindles This is shown by the Census returns which give separately the num bers of ring spindles and of mule spindles for each census year except 1880 SPINDLES IN U S  IN MILLIONS 1870 1880 1890 1900 1905 Ring 37 89 134 179 Mule 34  54 56 52 Total 71 106 143 190 232 Thus in 1905 there were more than three times as many ring spindles as mule spindles in operation in the United States At the present time many mills are discarding worn out mules and replacing them with ring frames Hence the proportion of mules in spite of the increase in the quantity of fine spinning is becoming constantly less In Great Britain on the other hand the mule predominates It is in that country that the mule has been developed to its present high standard of efficiency To be sure the ring frame was introduced into England during the seventies and its use gradu ally extended But the British manufacturers have never extensively adopted the ring frame At the present time the number of mule spindles is six times as great as the number of ring spindles In 1907 according to the returns to the International Federa tion of Master Cotton Spinners and Manufacturers Associations there were 36667320 of the former and only 6487393 of the latter in England Instead of 1 J Nasmith Recent Cotton Mill Construction p 10COTTON MANUFACTURING SINCE 1860 129 adopting the ring frame the English manufacturers have devoted their energies to the perfection of the mule In 1860 the selfactor was used in the manu facture of only the coarsest yarns the hand mules still being used for all other work Gradually how ever the self actor has superseded the hand mule for all but the highest counts so that today the hand mule is used in England for spinning only the very finest yarns The reasons why the ring frame predominates in this country and the mule in England are to be found in the differing conditions of the two countries It is not overconservatism nor preference for spinning by the more scientific method which has induced the British manufacturer to cling to the mule while the American manufacturer has been introducing the ring frame Rather it is because the mule fits the needs of the British manufacturer better while the ring frame is peculiarly adapted to the conditions in this country In the first place the English mills spin much more fine yarn than do the American mills As the mule is used for finer yarns this accounts partially for the greater number of mules in England Again in spinning the lower counts more sort staple cotton is used in England than in this country The English purchase more short staple and they rework more of the waste from the card and comber thus economis ing in raw material This shorter staple would not stand the strain of the ring frame as well the ends would break more frequently In the third place the British manufacturers size the yarn more heavily for certain grades of cloth In the United States on the other hand there is no heavy sizing and no coarse 2 S J Chapman Lancashire Cotton Industry p 70130 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS mule yarn is demanded for this purpose Finally we have an important factor in the separation of spinning and weaving in England and their combination in this country In England spinning and weaving are carried on in separate mills Very few establish ments both spin and weave Hence for the English manufacturer the use of the ring frame would in crease expense in shipping weft yarn at least be cause of the freight charges on the bobbins On the other hand in the United States the yarn is usually spun and woven in the same mill If woven in the mill where it is spun it can be handled as conveniently on bobbins as on cops This helps to explain why the use of the ring spindle has been restricted in Eng land So far as this country is concerned however the combination of spinning with weaving is as much a result as a cause of the preference for the ring spindle There are other factors however which make ring spinning adapted to cotton manufacturing in the United States These are connected with the labor situation The output per operative is much greater upon the ring spindle than upon the mule spindle In this country where the scale of wages is higher the manufacturers must seek to economize in labor to reduce the labor cost Even more important than the greater output per operative on the ring frame is the fact that less skilled labor is necessary Thus the labor cost is further reduced In Great Britain a class of skilled cotton mill operatives almost a hereditary class provides an adequate supply of skilled mule spinners In America on the other hand the cotton manufacturers have always had to adapt them selves to a class of shifting and unskilled workmen During the first half of the century when the ring frame was being introduced and when the operativesCOTTON MANUFACTURING SINCE 1860 131 were native born the labor force in the cotton mills was constantly changing The employees looked upon the cotton mills as a convenient place to get a start in life Once having got that start they left for other employments so that no skilled class was developed Since the Civil War the foreign immi grants have invaded the cotton mills of New England Some of these immigrants have come from Great Britain and have been possessed of sufficient skill to become mule spinners But not all of them became mule spinners Many of them are weavers or slasher tenders Hence the English immigrants could not supply the entire demand for spinners or even a considerable part of it The ring frame on the other hand required little experience or skill Consequently the French Canadian the Irishman the Pole the Portugese and the other foreigners that we find in the mill today could be employed as ring spinners Here as in many other American industries the possibility of employing the unskilled immigrants and the adapta tion of machinery to that end has been an important factor in promoting the success of manufacturing The situation has been substantially the same in the South The southern manufacturers also have had no supply of skilled labor to draw upon and the ring frame has been of equal importance to the rise of the industry in that section by making possible the em ployment of unskilled native help It has been fre quently stated and is even now stated by some manu facturers themselves that the troublesomeness of the mule spinners union has led to the replacement of the mule by the ring frame It may have had some thing to do with it But at present mules are being replaced in mills where there is not a mule spinners union no less rapidly than in the Fall River mills132 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS where the mule spinners union is considered to be the chief disturbing factor The fundamental reasons for the throwing out of the mules from the American mills are those just stated the lower labor cost of spinning on the ring frame the greater output per operative and the possibility of employing  cheap labor  for this work In Great Britain on the other hand the supply of skilled labor and the separation of spinning and weaving have perpetuated the use of the mule On the Continent of Europe the number of mule spindles is more nearly equal the number of ring spindles In 1907 the number of each was as follows SPINDLES IN 19071 Mule Ring Germany 5 469 785 3 722

United States or in Eng land The mule and the ring frame are used to about the same extent In some regions the supply of skilled workmen and the lower wage scale have made feasible the use of the mule In others the rapid expansion of the industry has stimulated the use of the ring frame the supply of skilled spinners being insufficient Fur thermore there is less fine spinning on the Continent than in England and many of the establishments carry on both spinning and weaving Thus the ring frame has found a place For these reasons the dif ferences are not so clearly marked as in the United States or in England 1 This table is based on the returns published in the circular of the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners and Manufacturers Associations for 1907COTTON MANUFACTURING SINCE 1860 133 III SPOOLING WARPING SiZING By these processes the warp yarn is prepared for the loom It is unwound from the bobbins or cops of the spinning machine on to spools thence on to the beam of the warper From this beam the yarn is unwound as it passes through the slasher where it is sized and then rewound on to another beam on which it is carried to the loom We proceed now to an examination of the history and characteristics of the spooler and here again we find that most of the improvements have originated in this country and have been adapted to the needs of our manufacturers The most important of these improvements has been the introduction of the wire bobbin holder invented by Wade in the seventies This holder has since been modified somewhat but only in detail Its advantage consists in the possi bility of running the spooler at a higher rate of speed and at the same time lessening the wear and tear on the bobbins Means have also been provided for taking care of the empty bobbins The first device for this purpose the chute delivers the bobbins into boxes by the side of the machine2 Recently the travelling belt has been introduced whereby the bobbins are collected into boxes at the end of the spooler By these appliances time is saved and there is less loss of bobbins The labor cost of spooling has always been relatively high hence the significance of these improvements in cutting it down They show how the American manufacturers have sought to relieve the pressure Not only have the Americans I Centennial Exhibition 1876 Reports and Awards vol iii Group 8 p 20 2 G 0 Draper Textile Texts 2nd ed pp 184185134 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS made the improvements but at the present time it is said that the English have been slow in adopting them Another machine which has brought about a saving in the labor of spooling is the Barber Knotter This little machine invented by an American in 19001 is a small affair worn on the back of the hand of the girl who tends the spooler When a thread breaks the two ends are put together in the machine and by merely closing the hand the ends are tied and the loose pieces cut off The knotter saves at least ten per cent in the time of spooling Furthermore its effect is cumulative It ties the ends better than they are tied by hand 2 hence in warping the yarn of its tying there are fewer breaks and less time is lost in piecing In weaving its effects are no less apparent since bad knots are very likely to cause bad places in the cloth The percentage of seconds in weaving is cut down by its use Last but not least the knotter not only reduces the labor cost by saving time but also makes posssible the utilisation of less skilled labor by doing the work which required most skill on the part of the operative The present type of beam warper was invented in England and was in use both in that country and in America before 1860 But it has been greatly improved during the last fifty years chiefly by American manu facturers The improvements have consisted in the general perfection of the construction and in the application of better stop motions than those intro duced into this country from England 3 before 1860 The result has been an increase in speed and in out put per machine At the same time the number of machines per warper tender has become larger At 1 New England Cotton Manufacturers Association Transactions No 72 p 212 2 Idem 2 R H Baird American Cotton Spinner p 205COTTON MANUFACTURING SINCE 1860 135 present one woman almost invariably tends four machines whereas thirty or forty years ago there was one tender for every warper In England however I am informed on good authority the manufacturers have been less progressive in bringing their warpers up to date and generally there is but one machine per operative On the Continent hand machines have been employed for warping till comparatively recent years2 The chain warper which is used for the yarn dyed or bleached before being woven has also been improved The improvements have especially aided those manu facturers producing certain kinds of colored goods such as stripes and ginghams But the most impor tant inventions in connection with this process have been those which aim to prevent snarls and breaks in the dyehouse and in rewarping and quilting This object has been attained by winding a thread around the chain from end to end which holds the yarn to gether and prevents snarls and breaks3 After the yarn has been bleached or dyed this protecting thread must be unwound and for this purpose a special machine Straws Patent4 has again been devised These innovations the product of American ingenuity are of recent origin and reflect the greater attention which this class of work is receiving from the American manufacturers The dyed warp yarn is rebeamed after the protecting thread has been unwound The machinery for rebeaming is a spot yet untouched by the inventor and the work is still laborious On the other hand the introduction of the long chain quiller 1 T M Young American Cotton Industry p 29 2 G Beaumont LIndustrie Cotonniere en Normandie p 17 also Martin Die wirtschaftliche Aufschwung der

for the shuttle has reduced the labor cost of that operation This long chain quiller is another recent American invention It can be run by a woman or a girl Moreover it re quires but one operative who with the aid of this machine does the work for which eight or nine men were employed formerly Yet in spite of the reduc tion in the labor cost of preparing dyed yarn for the loom during the last ten years the extra labor neces sary for this work is still one of the chief reasons for the greater cost of manufacturing goods in which dyed yarn is used Since 1860 the old dressing process for sizing the warp yarn has been superseded by the slasher The slasher consists primarily of a large cylinder with its underneath surface immersed in the sizing solution Around this the yarn passes then over other cylinders where it is dried before being wound upon another beam for the loom The slasher was invented in England and adopted there before 1860 It was not till 1866 that the first slasher was imported into the United States In regard to the economies which resulted from its introduction Mr Atkinson in his report in the Census of 18802 stated that  in the use of the slasher one man and a boy working in a thoroly well ventilated room at a moderate degree of heat took the place of seven or eight men who had previously been employed in the same work in a room which was of necessity kept at over 100 F the atmosphere saturated with sour starch Another statement of the saving accomplished by the slasher was given by Mr Tyron in an address before the New England Cotton Manufacturers Association in 18983 1 New England Cotton Manufacturers Association Transactions No 64 p208 2 Tenth Census vol ii p 13 3 New England Cotton Manufacturers Association Transactions No 64 p 199COTTON MANUFACTURING SINCE 1860 137 He said  one dresser formerly would only supply warp for 100 looms on ordinary sheetings at a labor cost of from 18 to 24 per week at present one slasher will supply warp for from 500 to 700 looms on the same class of goods at a cost of from 9 to 12 per week In addition to this economy in labor the quality of the product has been improved since the yarn is sized more evenly The American manufac turers at first hesitated to adopt this machine but as soon as its advantages were recognized they quickly made the change and as early as 1875 it had come into general use In the United States the quantity of size put into the yarn does not vary greatly between different mills In England there is a wide variation In American mills the amount of size which is added to the yarn is usually about six per cent of the weight of the yarn enough to make the yarn weave well But in Great Britain the amount of size varies from less than fifteen per cent pure sizing to over two hundred per cent very heavy sizing1 Thus some English cloth called cotton really contains as much or even more of other material When the yarn is sized more than fifteen per cent the object is not so much to improve its weaving quality as to substitute for cotton a cheaper material The practice of heavy sizing came in England by gradual steps The stress of competition first encouraged adulteration Later the Russian War cut off the supplies of the regular sizing materials and thus in creased their price As a result China clay came to be substituted2 Again during the American Civil War when the supply of raw cotton was curtailed the English manufacturers sought to substitute other U S Daily Consular Reports March 22 1907 No 2824 p 5 2 British Parliamentary Papers 1872 203 p 2138 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS materials and thus the practice of adulterating cotton cloth spread It was continued even after the supply of raw cotton resumed normal proportions for the adulterated grades of cloth could be manufactured very cheaply Because of their cheapness they have made a market for themselves especially in Asia The British manufacturers have frequently been accused of cheating their customers of selling their goods under false pretenses These accusations may have been true at an earlier date but at the present time the customers are well aware of the character of the cloth which they are purchasing and are satisfied with their bargain The fact is that the goods are better adapted to their purses At the same time their wearing qualities are not seriously impaired The native purchaser does not wish to wash his clothes He would not wash them even if half their weight should not be lost in the operation He simply wears them till they wear out By cater ing to this class of customers the English manufac turers have enlarged their markets Just as they have reached out in the one direction to cater to the class desiring to buy very fine fabrics so have they reached out at the other extreme to the class of pur chasers who can afford to buy only the cheapest goods The American manufacturer has been urged con stantly to adopt this method of heavy sizing to expand his foreign trade Why has he failed to accept this advice In the first place as already pointed out the yarn spun on the ring frame is not so well adapted to taking a heavy size Hence the method of spin ning more economical for the American manufacturer is not so well suited to this purpose as is that of the I British Parliamentary Papers 1872 203 p 2 also R Marsden Cotton Weav ing p 325COTTON MANUFACTURING SINCE 1860 139 English manufacturer Furthermore for heavy siz ing more supervision is necessary It is to the ad vantage of the American manufacturer to economize in labor for spinning and sizing rather than in raw cotton All these reasons however are less import ant now than they have been in the past New appli ances facilitate the spinning of more loosely twisted yarn on the ring frame and if the heavy sizing were done on a sufficiently large scale the American manu facturer could probably turn out this class of goods as cheaply as does the English But the American manufacturer has not yet been compelled to turn regularly to foreign markets for the disposal of large quantities of cloth To carry on the trade in heavily sized goods profitably a large market would be neces sary since the cost of frequently changing the slasher from heavy sizing to pure sizing and vice versa would be prohibitive The machine can be run far more economically on a single grade of work Consequently so long as the rapidly expanding domestic market continues to absorb all the cloth manufactured in American cotton mills so long will the American manu facturer neglect other markets where the competition is keener Inasmuch as there is no outlet for heavily sized goods in the domestic market he does not find it profitable to run part of his machinery on that grade of work It is not because the American manu facturer is more honest that he has failed to develop a trade in heavily sized goods It is because he has found other lines more profitable Let us return after this digression to our history of the technical development in the remaining de partments the weaving and finishing processes140 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS IV WEAVING To make the cloth the threads are interwoven ac cording to the pattern desired The threads length wise of the cloth called the warp are subdivided into two or more sets which are alternately raised and dropped to allow the shuttle to pass under and over them The yarn crosswise of the cloth called weft or filling is carried by the shuttle If only one color of weft is used a single shuttle is sufficient But for certain fancy goods and especially for ginghams in which there are several colors of weft a drop box loom is used the shuttles being placed one on top of the other so that they can be brought in to place at the proper time by the up and down motion of the box After the warp has been sized the ends must be drawn through the harness of the loom The harness consists of a frame of heddles cords or wires with an eyelet in the centre through each of which a warp thread is drawn The number of harnesses per loom varies from two upward according to the complexity of the pattern to be woven Prior to 1900 several unsuccessful attempts 1 had been made to devise a machine for drawing in the warp The ends were still laboriously drawn in by hand But during the last five years two machines have been invented in this country which are supplanting the girls formerly employed for drawing in The first of these machines is a warp tier the Barber Warp Tying Machine It was offered to the trade for the first time in 19042 To quote from one of the men engaged in introducing it  the broad principle of the machine is to tie the ends of the last of an old warp to the corresponding I National Association of Cotton Manufacturers Transactions No 81 p 286 2 New England Cotton Manufacturers Association Transactions No 78 p 226COTTON MANUFACTURING SINCE 1860 141 ends of a new warp 1 When one warp is nearly used up the ends are cut so as to leave a short piece of each thread in the harness Then when it is desired to weave another piece of cloth of the same pattern the harness with these ends still in it is brought to the tying machine which ties together one by one the ends of the old warp and those of the new The prin ciple of the machine is the same as that of the spooler knotter previously described It ties about two hun dred and fifty knots per minute and does the work of about twenty girls Drawing in by hand had al ways been a relatively heavy expense to the manufac turer by the use of this machine the labor cost is cut down two thirds2 The disadvantage in its use is the necessity of keeping many harnesses on hand one for each of the different patterns For every variation in the number of ends or in the number of harnesses per pattern a different set of harnesses must be kept in readiness Moreover the machine cannot distin guish colors Hence it can be used only on plain work But those mills which make only three or four styles of plain cloth are not hindered by these disadvantages The second of these inventions actually draws the ends through the heddles3 Thus there is no accumu lation of harnesses as under the other system But the drawingin machine does not turn out as much work as the tying machine Moreover it wears out the heddles more rapidly Yet it does effect a marked saving over hand labor since one man operating a drawingin machine will draw in about six times as many warps a day as a girl can draw in by hand on the same grade of goods Furthermore the machine I New England Cotton Manufacturers Association Transactions No 78 p 226 2 Ibid p 227 3 Described in Transactions of National Association of Cotton Manufacturers No 81 p 286 et seq142 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS is not limited to simple patterns By means of a Jaquard arrangement it can be used for six harness work But like the tying machine the drawingin machine cannot detect differences in color Hence it too can be used only for plain work Girls are still employed for drawing in the warps where there are threads of different colors And even on plain work the machines have not entirely superseded the girls owing to the conservatism of some managers These machines were not only invented in this country but as yet have not been accepted to any extent by foreign manufacturers In England the work is still done by hand by men who earn I am told wages as high as 14 per week as compared with 9 per week earned by the girls employed on the same work in our mills But these men are highly skilled and do part of the planning which is cared for by the designer in American mills The machines are the result of the pressure which the American manufac turers have felt because of the relatively high labor cost of drawing in the warps by hand and the diffi culties of obtaining labor for this work The growth of the industry in this country had greatly intensified this latter difficulty The introduction of the warptying machine and the drawingin machine has not only cut down the labor cost to the manufacturer but has also made possible the mechanical performance of work which was a severe strain upon the millworkers Drawing in requires very close application on the part of the operative who has to sit in the same position for sev eral hours and watch unremittingly every movement which she makes The release from this exhaust ing work will be of benefit to the health of the operativesCOTTON MANUFACTURING SINCE 1860 143 While the danger of mistakes prevents the use of these machines for drawing warps in which there are various colored threads the bulk of the goods manufactured in this country are plain Hence the machines are adapted to the needs of the majority of our cotton mills As a result of their introduction one of the remaining hand processes in the manufac ture of cotton cloth is at the present time passing out of existence For weaving the hand looms ceased to be used in American mills long before the Civil War The power loom was introduced in 1814 and from that time it has been steadily improved Since 1860 it has shared in the general improvement in cotton manufacturing machinery While its speed has not been increased to any extent its construction has been perfected The tendency has been to improve the quality of the work and thereby increase the quantity of perfect cloth produced per loom The improvement in the quality of the work and the diminution of the amount of necessary attention from the operative have been facilitated by the application of better stop motions  devices which stop the loom automatically when a warp thread breaks the weft breaks or the shuttle is out of place Those stops which had been intro duced prior to the Civil War were adapted only to looms weaving coarse cloth With the increase in the manufacture of fine goods it became desirable to apply stop motions to the looms on those grades and as a result of the successful use of finer and thinner wire in their manufacturer they are now found in every uptodate mill on all grades of work These stop motions have received their greatest improve I New England Cotton Manufacturers Association Transactions No 68 p 319 2 Idem144 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS ments and exploitation in this country By means of their use on the more perfectly constructed lQoms the number of looms per weaver and consequently the output per weaver has become greater Weavers who formerly tended six to eight looms now tend from ten to fourteen The most significant feature in the development of looms has been the introduction of the automatic loom Of several types of automatic looms one stands out preeminently the Northrop loom This loom was put upon the market in 1894 by the Draper Company a perfected machine It was the outcome of the efforts of five inventors devoted to this task for several years with the definite object of producing a practicable automatic loom The fundamental prin ciple of the machine was originated by Northrop whose name it bears but at least equal credit is due the Draper Company because of the foresight and ability of their managers and experimenters through whose efforts success was ultimately achieved The new features embodied in it are in the words of one of the inventors  a shuttle changing device he means a bobbin changing device a filling hopper from which bobbins or cops are automatically transferred to the loom shuttle a peculiar shuttle which can be threaded automatically by the motion of the loom devices that act to stop the loom if the shuttle is not in position and a warp stop motion to prevent the making of poor cloth 1 The most important of these innovations is the weft changing device The shuttle is not changed when it has exhausted the thread on a bobbin but the empty bobbin is automatically thrown out and a full bobbin just as automatically put in its place This change is made so quickly that the speed of the loom 1 New England Cotton Manufacturers Association Transactions No 59 p 91COTTON MANUFACTURING SINCE 1860 145 is not retarded A vast amount of time which was formerly spent in the stoppage of the loom on account of exhausted shuttle is thus saved On the common loom the shuttle has to be changed every eight minutes or oftener The Northrop loom stops only when a warp thread breaks or the shuttle is out of position thus saving perhaps one hundred stops a day2 The use of one shuttle moreover eliminates a large amount of labor in setting the pick i e adjusting the mechan ism which drives the shuttle Furthermore the sav ing in the wear and tear of the machinery from frequent stoppage is not inconsiderable In order to bring these results to perfection a reliable warp stop was necessary and it is in connection with the designing of the Northrop loom that the chief improvements in the warp stop motion have been made Another point and one on which enough emphasis has not been laid is the automatic threading device a boon to the weaver who formerly had to thread the shuttle from five hundred to one thousand times a day3 sucking in the filling each time In doing this he inhaled more or less cotton lint to say nothing of sizing materials and dust No wonder that weavers have been spoken of as a consumptive class  The automatic threading device has stimulated other man ufacturers to devise means for mechanically threading the shuttle on plain looms4 Yet in many mills the shuttles are still threaded in the old way Since first introduced the Northrop loom has been improved in various details so as not only to perfect I Twelfth Census vol ix p 44 2 In 1895 W F Draper estimated the saving in the number of stops per day to be

but also to adapt it to a wider range of work At the outset it was necessary to use ring spun filling But by means of skewers mule cops can now be trans ferred to the shuttle as easily as bobbins It is no longer confined to the manufacture of coarse goods Several manufacturers are now successfully weaving fine cloth on Northrop looms Moreover it has be come possible to weave more and more complicated patterns It is still limited to goods with only a single color of weft yarn Patterns in which weft yarn of different colors is used require a drop box loom2 to which the weft changing device is not adapted The chief advantage of the Northrop loom consists in a saving of labor It has reduced the labor cost of weaving one half a fact which is all the more im portant since the labor cost of weaving constituted one half of the entire labor cost of manufacturing cotton cloth This saving has resulted from the in creased number of looms per weaver One weaver now tends from fourteen to thirty Northrop looms3 where before he tended six to eight common looms At the same time less skill is required on the part of the operative Notwithstanding this increased output of the weaver there has been no lack of work for this class of mill operatives Rather has the change re lieved a strain felt by the manufacturers who often found it difficult to obtain enough weavers With the rapid expansion of the industry during the last fifteen years the difficulties of obtaining weavers would have been much greater had it not been for the in troduction of this loom Yet the Northrop loom I G 0 Draper Textile Texts 2nd ed p 252 2 See page 140 8 In one Southern mill there is a weaver tending 34 Northrop loomsCOTTON MANUFACTURING SINCE 1860 147 has not been adopted in all mills which are making goods that could be woven on it Since the initial cost is heavy many manufacturers have not deemed it profitable to scrap their plain looms But it has been installed in most of the new mills especially in the South As the plain looms in the older mills wear out they will without doubt be replaced by Northrops In England the plain looms have undergone as great improvements during the last fifty years as have the plain looms in the United States The English manu facturers however use a different type of loom the overpick loose reed loom Without attempting a comparison of the intricate details of the two types of loom let me quote from Mr Whittam He says  In English mills except for weaving heavy cloth the  over pick  loom with a loose reed is in general use It is contended by the Lancashire weaver that he can run his looms at decidedly greater speeds adjust the pick to a greater nicety and better avoid costly  smashes  from trapped shuttles than would be possible with the underpick and fastreed style of loom which is in general use in the United States 1 The chief reason for this preference of the English manufacturers seems to be that the overpick loom can be run at a higher rate of speed and a greater output per loom obtained But the number of looms per weaver in English mills is about one half of that in American mills Consequently the output per weaver is less in England altho the speed of the looms is from fifteen to twenty per cent greater2 The adherence of the English manufacturers to the over pick loom is due in the main to the difference in labor conditions They have a larger supply of skilled 1 W Whittam Jr Report on Englands Cotton Industry p 23 2 E Helm An International Survey of the Cotton Industry in Quarterly Journal of Economics vol xvii p 249148 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS weavers and a somewhat lower wage scale Hence it is to their advantage to increase the output per machine even if the output per operative is somewhat less Moreover owing to the strength of the labor unions in the English cotton industry a weaver is paid at the same rate per cut without reference to the number of looms which he tends In American mills on the other hand a weaver is paid less per cut when he tends more looms Tho the rate per cut is less his total earnings are greater because he gets off a greater number of cuts At the same time the lower rate per cut effects a considerable saving to the manufacturer in the labor cost of weaving Still another reason why the American manufacturers have failed to adopt the over pick loom is that it requires more attention from the operative They have clung to the loom which gives the greatest output per weaver The hand loom remained in use on the Continent long after it had disappeared from American and English cotton mills1 In the United States the hand loom was not used in cotton mills after 1830 nor in England to any extent after 18602 But in France as late as 1885 cotton cloth was being woven on more than 33000 hand looms3 which was more than one third of the total number of looms in the country at that time In Germany and in Italy the use of the hand loom persisted even longer In 1861 only nine per cent of the looms in Germany were power looms4 Lochmueller stated in 1906 that hand looms were still in use in Germany under the domestic system5 In 1 E Helm An International Survey of the Cotton Industry in Quarterly Journal of Economics vol xvii p 422 2 W J Ashley British Industries p 69 3 H Lecomte Le Coton p 368 4 A Oppel Die Baumwolle p 654 5 W Lochmueller Baumwollindustrie in Deutschland p 18COTTON MANUFACTURING SINCE 1860 149 Italy as late as 1903 13807 of the 78700 looms em ployed for weaving cotton cloth were hand looms The antiquated type of machine has persisted longer in these countries because of the difference in labor conditions With a large supply of more or less skilled labor willing to work for low wages there has not been the same incentive for the introduction of labor saving machinery The lack of this incentive the conser vatism of the managers and of the workmen and the greater cost of the more expensive power loom have retarded the extinction of the hand loom The Con tinental manufacturers have economised in capital the English manufacturers and to a greater extent the American in labor A similar hesitancy has been shown by the Euro pean manufacturers in accepting the Northrop Loom Altho in England this loom has secured a firm foot hold it has not been accepted there nearly so readily as in the United States Its inventor an English man by birth2 attempted unsuccessfully to induce English machine manufacturers to take up his idea before coming to the United States the  inventors Paradise 3 where his suggestions were welcomed and developed For the same reasons that its in troduction has been slower its use will probably be more limited in England than in the United States In the first place the mule cop is not so well adapted to the hopper of the Northrop loom as is the bobbin of the ring frame Altho this difficulty has been partly removed by skewering the cops that operation takes time Then again the loom has been adapted but gradually to the weaving of fine goods and even 1 Annuario Statistico Italiano 1907 p 452 2 T M Young American Cotton Industry p 22 3 Ibid p 136150 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS now many of the fine goods manufactured in England could not be woven advantageously on the Northrop loom Moreover it is not adapted to the weaving of fancies There thus is a considerable field in Eng land which it cannot reach a field which is not only absolutely but relatively larger than in the United States In spite of the advance in the production of finer cotton cloth in this country the bulk of our out put is still coarse and medium grades of plain goods Another retarding factor has been the risk and ex pense of introducing the new device In the United States even many manufacturers have delayed the installation of Northrop looms until their common looms should be worn out Similarly in England the cotton manufacturers have been unwilling to scrap their machinery and put in these expensive looms so long as their old looms are still serviceable Finally the attitude of the workmen has not favored the in troduction of the automatic loom2 While there has been no open opposition the strength of the weavers unions in England would enable them to hinder the introduction of a loom which would diminish the de mand for weavers The employers have apprehended difficulty in inducing weavers to accept lower piece rates and only with lower piece rates would the Nor throp loom be a profitable investment The English manufacturers moreover do not feel so great pressure to introduce labor saving machinery Even were the loom to be generally adopted by them the absolute saving would be less than in this country Hence they can better afford to delay As in England so in the other cotton manufactur ing countries of Europe the Northrop loom has been 1 Report of Chamberlain Tariff Commission vol ii  88 and 213 2 IdemCOTTON MANUFACTURING SINCE 1860 151 introduced but slowly In France a few mills have experimented with it but the number of the new looms per weaver has been only from eight to ten about one half as many as in the United States Similar ex periments which are being made in other countries do not succeed in bringing the average output per weaver up to that in the United States Once more the lack of economy in labor in European cotton mills shows itself The Northrop loom is not only the product of American enterprise but it is also pecu liarly adapted to the industrial conditions prevailing in this country In all of the processes in the manufacture of cotton cloth the question of humidity is important It is important because the machinery and the cotton passing through the machinery generate a certain amount of electricity which affects the smoothness with which the work runs Cotton manufacturing is therefore factilitated by a humid atmosphere which reduces the amount of electricity generated For merly those localities having an unusually humid climate possessed advantages over the localities less favored in this respect But during the last half of the nineteenth century cotton manufacturers have devised means for artificially humidifying the atmos phere in their mills One of the first of these methods was steaming  the introduction of hot steam di rectly into the rooms This has now been largely superseded both in England and the United States by artificial humidifiers which moisten the air with cold water In England the degree of humidity is regulated by law2 in order to protect the operatives  Enquete sur lIktat de lincdustrie textile vol iv p 77 2 1 Edw 7 c 22 ss 9096152 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS from the danger of excessive humidification In the United States unfortunately there is no such pro tection A new device however is being introduced at present which may make regulation of humidity unnecessary This device attacks the problem from a different quarter by seeking to neutralize the static electricity in the machine and the cotton through the generation of a counteracting current of electri city The very simplicity of its principle makes it seem almost strange that no one has applied it before If it proves a success as it bids fair to the necessity of humidification will be done away with and thereby the health of the operatives benefited and the man ager relieved of the trouble of regulating the degree of humidity While an American invention its prin ciple will no doubt be adopted in other countries V CONVERTING AND FINISHING There is wide variety in the machines for convert ing and finishing cotton cloth since after it has been woven it may be bleached printed dyed or mercer ized and then put through numerous other machines to finish it before being shipped Each of these machines and processes has a history of its own A brief summary will suffice to show the general ten dencies of the development The methods of bleaching have undergone few changes during the last fifty years or even during the last century With more accurate knowledge of the chemicals it has become possible for the bleachers to adjust their methods more scientifically to the differ ent grades of work The machinery in general and the boiling kiers in particular have been improved so that a greater quantity of work can be turned outCOTTON MANUFACTURING SINCE 1860 153 per machine with less labor Better facilities for drying have also been an important factor in lessening the amount of time necessary for the process2 The methods and machinery for bleaching are the same in Europe and America altho there is perhaps more machinery in American bleacheries and the cloth is run through at a somewhat greater speed Because of this difference in speed a greater quantity of cloth is bleached with a given amount of labor here As in bleaching so in printing no new types of machines have been introduced during the last half century Cylinder printing was first used in England in the last quarter of the eighteenth century and in the United States in 18103 The construction of the printing machine is more perfect now its work better and more colors can be used Then too the penta graph has facilitated the engraving of the rollers But the greatest change has come about in the color ing materials as a result of the discovery and appli cation of the coal tar colors4 A young Englishman Perkin discovered the first of these in 1856 and in 1858 Hofmann a German discovered aniline red Since then many more have been found In the develop ment of this auxiliary industry the Germans have been preeminent and consequently have developed a large export trade in these products While some coal tar dyestuffs are now manufactured in this coun try the greater part used in our mills is still imported from Germany The introduction of these coal tar colors has brought about a revolution by reducing the labor cost and widening the range of colors All 1 New England Cotton Manufacturers Association Transactions No 77 p 170 2 See page 157 3 Census of 1860  Manufactures p 18 4 For a good description of these discoveries see A Sansone Recent Progress in Dyeing and Calico Printing vol i also Cyclopedia of Textile Work vol vi pp 149 235 and A H Allen Commercial Organic Analysis vol iii pp 100104154 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS cotton manufacturing countries however have bene fited to the same degree from these inventions Concomitant with this change in coloring materials has come an improvement in the designs of American prints But the one has been rather a means than a cause of the other The improvement in design has been the result of the general development of the cotton manufacturing industry and especially of the rise of cotton manufacturing in the South The com petition of the southern mills has forced the New England manufacturers to produce goods of a higher grade But even yet there is little originality in American designs which are largely copied from Paris Moreover the American manufacturers use fewer designs and turn out a much greater quantity of cloth of any one design than do the European manufac turers This is due to the economies of large scale production It costs less per yard to print large quantities of a single design than it does where the design is changed frequently There is an additional saving in that where fewer designs are printed it is not necessary to keep so many copper rollers in stock The printing machines in use in America are similar to those in England In fact many of our calico printing machines are imported from England But the output per machine is greater in this country Mr T M Young states that the average weekly pro duction per printing machine is 20000 yards in Great Britain and 75000 yards in the United States2 Thus by printing more of each design and also by running the machinery at a somewhat higher speed the Ameri can manufacturers have economized in labor 1 S H Higgins Dyeing in Germany and America p 49 2 T M Young American Cotton Industry p 119 also Higgins p 49COTTON MANUFACTURING SINCE 1860 155 The invention of the artificial dye stuffs has been an important factor in the progress of dyeing also a progress which has been especially rapid since the discovery of  Congo Red by Bottiger in 1884 This was the first of the so called  direct cotton dyes and it has been followed by many others As in printing the cost of dyestuffs has been reduced and the results improved This has led to an increase in raw stock dyeing2 For ginghams and other goods in which yarn of different colors is used the dyeing of the raw stock does away with the expense of pre paring the yarn for dyeing and of rewarping or quill ing it after it has been dyed But there are some disadvantages which partially at least offset this saving It is true that one difficulty has been over come Formerly the dyed cotton did not spin so well But this has been remedied by the introduction of single dip dyes Yet there is still the loss of dyestuff which colors the cotton that goes to waste a loss to be sure which becomes less as the price of dyestuffs falls Finally there is the chief difficulty raw stock dyeing necessitates the addition of a dyeing equipment to the manufacturing plant The yarn can be sent away to a special dye house to be dyed The raw cotton cannot Hence while many of the gingham mills and some other mills dye their raw stock there is still a great deal of yarn dyeing Furthermore new machines Straws Patent and the chain quiller which have been recently introduced have reduced the cost of rewarping and quilting the dyed yarn Hence many mills find it to their advantage to have the yarn dyed outside of the mill Piece dyeing too has shared in the general progress 1 Cyclopedia of Textile Work vol vi p 149 2 New England Cotton Manufacturers Association Transactions No 70 p 318156 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS As in bleaching and printing large lots are dyed at once in an American dyehouse since it does not pay to put through small lots The most marked con trast with this American practice is found in Germany where small establishments persist It is stated that the dyeing is sometimes done in the back yards in Germany2 The necessity of economy in labor has forced the American to carry on the work of dyeing like other work on a large scale A recent development of importance in the con verting of cotton cloth has been the introduction of mercerization3 This process  consists in treating cotton in the condition of yarn or of woven goods to the action of caustic soda dissolved in water and treat ing it subsequently with pure water and with dilute sulphuric acid for the purpose of washing out or ex tracting chemically the soda that remains in the yarn or fabric The process effectuates both a chemical and a physical change in the constitution of the fibre 4 The results of this mercerization are an increase in the strength of the material greater affinity of the goods for certain dyes and mordants and a silklike appear ance But the yarn is less elastic Moreover it has been successfully applied only to Egyptian and Sea Island cotton The process is simple but great care must be exercised in its application It was invented by John Mercer an Englishman in 1844 or 1846 and first put into practice in England But only since the improvements during the last twenty years has it developed to any extent either in England or other countries At present cotton manufacturers are gradually taking it up both in the United States and 1 S H Higgins Dyeing in Germany and America p 78 2 Ibid p 68 3 Twelfth Census vol ix pp 5253 4 IdemCOTTON MANUFACTURING SINCE 1860 157 in Europe The methods are the same in the different countries In connection with converting machinery perhaps some mention should also be made of the progress since 1860 in the machinery for drying the cloth Drying cylinders were first used for colored cloth but with the increase in the amount of cloth to be dried cylin ders came to be used also for white goods which had formerly been dried in sheds Recently the cell drier has been introduced into a few plants for all grades of work2 This machine in which the large cylinders are replaced by small copper boxes filled with high pressure steam about fifty of them being enclosed in one big box was invented by an American and is adapted to the conditions peculiar to this country since it is run at a high rate of speed and is conse quently used to advantage only where large quantities of cloth are to be dried at once There has been a similar development of other machines for finishing cotton cloth We now find improved machines for sewing together the ends of the pieces of cloth The shearing machines are much larger more complete with more cleaning appliances and have rolling attachments Moreover they run at a higher speed Stretching machines have been greatly improved Calendering machinery is more efficient and runs faster In singeing practically the same methods are employed as fifty years ago But the inspecting is now done more carefully with the aid of mechanical devices And finally the cloth is now mechanically measured and folded Some of these machines are used in finishing all kinds of goods Others are used only for a single kind as for example 1 New England Cotton Manufacturers Association Transactions No 63 p 237 2 S H Higgins Dyeing in Germany and America pp 5455158 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS the loopcutter which cuts the loose warp threads on the back of warp spot goods which previously had to be cut by hand before shearing The same types of finishing machines are in general used in both English and American mills The greatest improve ments in finishing machines during the last fifty years have been made in this country especially those patented by Curtis and Marble of Worcester who are the largest manufacturers of brushing shearing and cleaning machinery for cotton cloth in the world Moreover the machines are run at a somewhat faster speed in American mills Thus as in almost every instance where the type of machine is the same in England and in the United States the manufacturers push their machines harder in this country To sum up the effect of all the improvements in cotton manufacturing machinery during the last fifty years has been cumulative as regards both quantity and quality An improvement in one machine not only facilitates its work but at the same time prepares its product better so that the next machine can in turn do its work more rapidly and more efficiently In these improvements the American cotton manu facturers have played an important part We cannot say that their contributions have been greater than those of their English rivals But in these two coun tries have been made all the important inventions in cotton machinery since 1860 There have been occa sional inventions in other countries as Heilmanns comber in France and the Germans have made a very important contribution by developing the coal tar dyes But these contributions from other coun

so isolated The English inventions have been perhaps more in the direction of quality while the American inventions have been along the line of quantity It is true that the Americans have not sacrificed quality and at times have actually sought it but their object has been primarily to secure quantity The American manu facturer must needs economize in labor and accord ingly he has developed machines to that end He has adopted machines suited to the peculiar conditions with which he was face to face especially by intro ducing machines which cut down the labor cost He has adapted them to the production of large quantities of standardized patterns And further he has de veloped machines which permit the utilization of the most available supply of labor the unskilled immi grant It is to this development and adaptation far more than to any protective tariff that the progress of cotton manufacturing in the United States during the last half century has been due For that reason the American cotton manufacturing industry stands on a firm foundation at the present time On a simi lar adaptation its continued prosperity must depend in the future MELVIN T COPELAND HARVARD

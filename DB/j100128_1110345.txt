coownership resulted from marriage the relative rights of the husband and wife during coverture under the community system which exists in a number of the United States are not affected by common law precedents but must be determined by an examination of the Code Napoleon and the Spanish and Mexi can law2 from which the institution in its statutory form was princi pally derived3 The various codifications of the community States are so closely modeled on this law as it existed under the French Spanish and Mdexican dominions4 that the most important variations seem to be either limitations on the power of the husband as agent of the community made with the purpose of affording better protection to the wifes interest or regulations of dissolution and inheritance5 A substantial similarity however existed between the codes on this sub ject All property acquired during the marriage by onerous title or jointly by lucrative title belonged to the community6 a creature of the statute sui generis and on its dissolution was divided equally between the parties or their heirs subject to the common debts7 In the case of a separation caused by the adultery of one party however all acquets and gains fell to the innocent party8 The foundation for the system seems to have been the idea of a just recognition of the wifes services on the ground that she contributed equally with the husband to the acquisition of the property and secondarily the belief that both would thus be stimulated to labor and care in behalf of one another9 The relation has often been loosely termed a partnership but the inaptness of this expression is apparent10 The husband was the manager and in the absence of fraud or express legislative restric tion was authorized to deal with the community acquets and gains in all respects as if he were the owner thereof11 See Freeman Cotenancy and Partnership 2nd ed  I2I See Meyer v Kinzer I859 12 Cal 247 Other community systems have had slight influence only See

because of this complete control of the husband the courts have frequently been led to doubt the reality of the wifes interest in the common property during the continuance of the marriage relation12 Thus it is pointed out suits affecting com mon interests must be brought in the name of the former and the wife is not a party18 Again if common property be stolen the indict ment alleges that he is the owner14 and it seems that the wifes con sent cannot be pleaded by the thief15 and furthermore it is urged the common property is liable to seizure for the debts of the husband contracted before marriage16 Having considered the foregoing indi cations of the fullness of the husbands power these courts then pro ceed to demolish what they apparently regard as the most forceful argument for a present interest in the wife her power to attack a fraudulent conveyance made by the husband7 Finally by means of the much abused common law reasoning that an unenforceable right is no right at all they conclude that the husbands absolute power of management vests him with actual ownership and that the wifes interest is fictitiousa mere expectancy in the often quoted words of Justice Field18 Manifestly however the presence of the wife could not be required as a party in suits affecting the common possessions nor could her acquiescence in the supposed case of larceny be permitted to shield the thief without endowing her with a share of the hus bands power of management Furthermore the fact that the com munity is liable equally for the wifes antenuptial debts destroys the supposed force of the argument that it is liable for the husbands19 Her rights however are not proved merely by negative reasoning and when common law conceptions are thrust aside many evidences of the substantiality of her interest appear For example in several jurisdictions the wifes consent is now essential to an alienation of real estate20 while in one State the community is liable only for community obligations21 Again the wifes half seems to have been subject to confiscation without affecting that of the husband22 while the community is always liable for her support On the husbands insanity imprisonment or abandonment of the wife control seems See Guice v Lawrence 1847 2 La Ann 226 Moreau v Delche mendy I853 I8 Mo 522 Spreckels v Spreckels supra See Reade v de Lea supra

against fraud presupposes in her no vested right see 24 Harv L Rev 653 and whether the wife can during coverture bring her action against the husband seems debatable See Greiner v Greiner i88I 58 Cal

669COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW to pass to her23 Manifestly both where the wife is accorded the right of testamentary disposition24 and where her successors are deemed heirs25 her interest must be a vested one subject to defeat by the other spouse Her devisees or heirs can take no more than she pos sesses In the late case of Mazzei v Gruis et al La 1911 55 So 555 the court adhered to this test and held that on the death of the wife an undivided half interest vested immediately in her heirs subject under a statute to the usufruct of the husband thus again recognizing the doctrine here contended for26 As stated by Justice White It is a misconception    to suppose that because power was vested in the husband to dispose of the community acquired during marriage as if it were his own therefore by law the community property belonged solely to the husband27 The objection that the wife has no interest in the acquisitions and gains until the marriage is dissolved confounds the power of the husband to defeat the right with its existence28 The mind steeped in the common law should not lose sight of the fact that the community is a creature of law sui generis and that management and disposal are given the husband not on the ground of any greater interest but merely for supposed reasons of public policy and social economy29 POWERS OF A COURT TO EFFECTUATE THE INTENTION OF A TESTATOR It is axiomatic that the intention of a testator is the soundest basis for the judicial construction of a will and it is equally clear that this No case has been found which decided that the entire control passed to the wife but on the other hand it is difficult to conceive of a case where such a broad holding would be necessary to the decision Zimpleman v Robb I880 53 Tex 274 Slater v Neal I885 64 Tex

j100009,The American Economic Review,1827706,The Rural Organization Service,i331812,THE RURAL ORGANIZATION SERVICE By T N CARVER Director of the Rural Organization Service of the Department of Agriculture It has long been recognized that the peculiar weakness of agri culture lies in its lack of organization This lack of organization is due first to the large number of persons engaged in farming second to the fact that they live so far apart third to the fact that our system of settling the public lands was an extremely in dividualistic one fourth to the heterogeneous character of our rural population in most of the states Hitherto most of the work of the federal and state governments for the promotion of agriculture has related to the technical side of agricultural production It is the theory of the present Secre tary of Agriculture that it is quite as important that the work of buying supplies of marketing products and of rural finance should be promoted by government agencies as that the technical work of production should be so promoted Congress had already appro priated 50000 for the study of the problem of marketing and the diffusion of information on this subject among our agricultural population The Secretary saw however that the problem of marketing was largely a problem of organization and that organi zation includes a number of other things besides marketing Ac cordingly it was deemed desirable that a Rural Organization Service be established within the department to develop this new phase of agricultural promotion The General Education Board which had been lending its financial support to the farmers co operative demonstration work of the department organized by the late Dr Seaman A Knapp in the fifteen southern states were also planning to extend their work to other states and to other kinds of agricultural education An agreement was arranged whereby the Rural Organization Service should be supported by the General Education Board in order that the work might be begun in the field of rural organization Outside the office of markets two main lines of work are contem platedone in the field of rural finance including both long and short time credit and insurance and the other in the promotion of102 American Economic Association producers and purchasers associations In both these lines of work however it has been necessary to spend a good deal of time in making a preliminary survey of the field in order to find out what the situation actually is what the needs actually are and what agencies already exist for meeting these needs in whole or in part In the field of rural credit some excellent organizations are found already at work helping to solve this problem locally at any rate The building and loan associations for example or as they are sometimes called savings and loan associations have in one or two states entered the field of farm credits and are lend ing on farm mortgages on the amortization principle At least one private agency has been lending on farm mortgages on practi cally the same basis as the Credit Foncier of France Some of the middle western states also are literally honeycombed with farmers mutual insurance companies which are really co6perative societies for the supplying of this large need Cooperative cream eries in Minnesota and Wisconsin cooperative elevators in Iowa cooperative warehouses in North Carolina and cooperative pur chasing associations in about half the states have been doing some excellent work though of very uneven quality It appears at the present time as though aside from the work of actually promoting co6perative organizations the time and energy of the Rural Organization Service would be largely taken up first in convincing people that there is no magic about co operation second in making clear to wouldbe organizers the dis tinction between the j oint stock principal and the co6perative principal third in making it clear in some of the western states at least that better credit facilities are quite as likely to do harm as good except where they are safeguarded and permitted only to those farmers who have prepared to use the capital advanced to them for distinctively productive purposes Under the first head for example there are a great many very intelligent people who seem to think that the elimination of profit insures a saving to somebody It seems to take a surgical opera tion to get it through their heads that the private middleman who gets his salary in the form of profit may by eliminating what would otherwise be called a salary effect as great a saving as a cooperative society can by eliminating what are nominally called profits Under the second heading there are a great many who do not see that a j3oint stock company organized aTnong farmers is not aThe Rural Organization Service 103 co6perative society They overlook the fact that it is likely to happen under this form of organization that some of the leading stockholders may be more interested in dividends than in increasing the profits of the ordinary business of the farmer On the other hand some of the extreme advocates of cooperation seem to think that there is some magic about the one man one vote principle They are unable to see that all that is necessary is that the man agement of the society shall always be controlled in the interests not of the receiver of dividends but of the receiver of the ordinary farmers income That is to say the affairs of the association must always be managed so that the profit will come to the farmer in the form of better prices for his produce or lower prices on what he purchases rather than in the form of higher dividends on his investments From this point of view the one cow one vote principle is just as good as the one man one vote principle in a co6perative creamery Under the third head it is found that a great many farmers are borrowing money for nonproductive purposes or going in debt for things which do not add to their income merely because their credit is good It is probably safe to say that one half of the farmers who are now in debt would have been better off today if their credit had not been so good or if they had not been able to borrow on such favorable terms Among all the studies that have been made of European agricultural credit systems it has never yet been sufficiently emphasized that the function of a cooperative credit association is just as much to refuse credit as to give it The farmer on a western claim who as soon as he receives a title to his land mortgages it in order that he may go back East to visit his wifes folks would find himself unable to get anything on any terms from a wisely managed cooperative credit association What these European credit associations are really are associa tions for the promotion of productive agricultural enterprises by advancing capital for these enterprises only and refusing it for all other purposes whatsoever Until a group of farmers have this idea thoroughly in mind they are not in a position to be en couraged to start a cooperative credit association either for long time or short time credit

j100276,Michigan Law Review,1272929,Foreign Corporations Doing Business in State Failure to Comply with State Laws Validity of Contract,i254410,RECENT IMPORTANT DECISIONS Although the harshness of the common law respecting executors de son tort has been considerably modified especially in favor of those whose action is bona fide still there is little authority for extending them relief in equity In one state at least such relief seems allowable where the assets have been applied for the benefit of those entitled under legal administration Brown v Walter 58 Ala 3IO The general rule however is that in actions like the principal case the only method of obtaining relief for the executor de son tort is to prove under the general issue such payments in mitiga tion of damages as have been made by him in behalf of the estate in which case recoupment will be allowed for such as are held to be for the benefit of the estate if there is no deficiency of assets Tobey v Miller 54 Me 480 Reagan v Long 21 Ind 264 Glenn v Smith 2 Gill  Johns 493 513 That such a rule will work injustice to an executor de son tort who stands in a position of especial merit seems inevitable but it appears to be too well established on authority to admit of exception See on the general subject WILLIAMS ON EXECUTORS 7th Am Ed Vol I p 298 et seq WOERNER AM LAW OF ADMINISTRATION Vol I  195 FOREIGN CORPORATIONSDOING BUSINESS IN STATEFAILURE TO COMPLY WITH STATE LAWSVALIDITY OF CONTRACTThe plaintiff a foreign corpor ation set up business in Colorado with defendant in charge who sold goods on commission and under contract A statute I90I forbids a corporation to do any business or prosecute or defend any suit until the usual tax on its capital stock has been paid and an agent has been designated upon whom service of process can be made Held I that plaintiff was doing business in Colorado though the goods were manufactured in another state 2 that plaintiff not having complied with the statute has no right of action on the contract United States Rubber Company v Butler Bros Shoe Co I904 C C D Colo 132 Fed Rep 398 The court takes the view that a foreign corporation bringing goods into the state to be sold in the general market on commission is not engaged in interstate commerce but is located and doing business in the state See contra Allen v Buggy Co 91 Texas 22 40 S W Rep 393 People v Roberts 48 N Y Supp o028 25 App Div I3 Mineral Co v Clute 27 N Y Supp 342 7 Misc Rep I23 This case is to be distinguished from John Deere Plow Co v Wyland et al 76 Pac Rep 863 in that in the latter case the plaintiff kept no goods in the state but merely maintained resident agents through whom orders were solicited which were subject to accept ance or rejection by the plaintiff in a foreign state See 3 MICH LAW REv p 72 The court in the principal case correctly says that under the interstate commerce clause the foreign corporation could sell its wares to any purchaser in the state of Colorado without let or hindrance from the state authorities so long as the corporation did not establish a local busi ness Blevins v Fairley 71 Mo App 259 That such restrictions are valid where the corporation is not engaged in interstate commerce is unques tioned Ashland Lumber Co v Detroit Salt Co 114 Wis 66 89 N W Rep 904 908 Yet the act does not expressly declare contracts made in violation 239240 MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW of the statute to be void Under such circumstances a few cases hold con tracts made by foreign corporations to be valid But in the last analysis the question is one of interpretation of the legislative intent GARNISHMENTSITUS OF DEBTThe plaintiff a New York banking corporation doing business in New York brought suit in a court of New York city against a Massachusetts corporation having its place of business in Boston and in aid of this suit had attachment issued and garnishment served on a limited partnership of Massachusetts having its principal office in Boston and a branch office in New York in charge of the partner on whom the garnishment was served The garnishee was the sales agent of the defendant corporation and was indebted to it for goods received and sold and for money collected on sales made under such agency Held that the garnishee could not be charged because the situs of the debt owing by the garnishee was in Boston so that the court had no jurisdiction of it National Broadway Bank v Sampson 1904 N Y  71 N E Rep 766 The court relied on its previous decisions including the following Plimpton v Bigelozw 93 N Y 592 Douglass v Phenix Ins Co I38 N Y 209 33 N E 938 20 L R A 18 34 Am St Rep 448 Bank of China v Morse I68 N Y 458 6I N E 774 56 L R A 139 85 Am St Rep 676 For comment see NoTE AND COMMENT ante p 229 HUSBAND AND WIFESEPARATION AGREEMENTSVALIDITYDEFENSES A separation agreement entered into between husband and wife through the intervention of a trustee provided that in consideration of certain payments made and to be made by the husband to the wife the wife released the husband from liability for her support and agreed not to institute suit for her separate maintenance The wife subsequently brought an action in the probate court to compel the husband to contribute further to her support on the ground that the separation agreement was against public policy and void Whereupon the husband filed a bill in equity for the specific perform ance of the separation agreement The bill was dismissed Held on appeal affirming the decree that the husband under the statute could avail himself of the separation agreement as an equitable defense to the action of the wife in the probate court and that the agreement was valid Bailey v Dillon 1904  Mass  71 N E Rep 538 The validity of separation agreements made either after the separation has taken place or in contemplation of immediate separation in so far as they provide for the future support of the wife is well established in this country if they are based upon sufficient consideration are fair and reason able in their terms and are free from fraud and coercion Walker v WValker 9 Wall 741 Bowers v Hutchinson 67 Ark 15 In some jurisdic tions agreements of this nature are only valid when entered into through the intervention of a trustee because of the inability of the husband and wife to contract with each other and also for the reason that a certain amount of illegality is presumed to permeate contracts of this character Lawrence v Lawrence 32 Misc N Y 503 Scherer v Scherer 23 Ind App 384 McBean v McBcan I54 Mo 323 In other states

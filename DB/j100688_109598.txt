atmosphere 4thly That as the variable star in Sobieskis Shield is occasionally diminished in appearance to the 6th or 7th magnitude or even to a smaller magnitude it appears that these luminous particles are but sparingly dispersed in its atmosphere 5thly He asks may we not with much plausibility represent such luminous particles as spots somewhat circular and of no great ex tent 6thly That the principal bright parts are but slight patches may he says be presumed from the perpetual changes they undergo and also from such changes being very visible to us 7thly He thinks we may obtain some idea of the relative situation or intervals between these bright parts by the observations of the increase and decrease of brightness as thereby the changes and times elapsed are pointed out Mr Pigott says he has tried practically the effect of the above suppositions by placing small white spots on a dark sphere which sphere being turned round represented the various changes as nearly as could be expected Of these changes several views are given ac companied with some observations on variable stars in general in the course of which the author supposes it probable that many stars have lost their light and that there are many others which have never shown a glimpse of brightness He even asks whether we may not suppose the number of these unlenlightened stars equal to that of those endowed with light If so he thinks that by being collected together in clusters as in the Milky Way they must intercept all more distant rays and if free from any intervening lights must ap pear as dark spaces in the heavens similar to what has been observed in the southern hemisphere Mr Pigott at the conclusion of his paper says he thinks there are strong reasons to believe that the suns luminous appearance has been at times considerably diminished also that he has little hesitation in conceiving it may at some future period be reduced to small patches An Account of some analytical BExperiments on a mineral Production from Devonshire consisting principally of A lumine and Water By Humphry Davy Esq FRS Professor of Chemistry in the Royal Institution Read February 28 1805 Phil Trans 1805 p 155 The mineral of which an account is here given by Mr Davy was found many years ago by Dr Wavel in a quarry near Barnstaple It was then considered as a kind of zeolite but Mr Hatchett who visited the place in the year 1796 describes it as filling some cavities and veins in a rock of soft argillaceous schistus and from that cir cumstance concluded that it most probably did not belong to the182 abovementioned genus Dr Babington from its physical characters and from some experiments made on its solution in acids ascertained that it was a mineral substance not yet described and that it con tained a considerable portion of aluminous earth This mineral is generally found in small hemispherical groups of crystals composed of filaments radiating from a common centre and inserted on the surface of the schistus  sometimes however it forms small veins of irregularly disposed prisms It is of a white colour having sometimes a tinge of gray or of green and when beginning to be decomposed of yellow Its lustre is silky it is generally al most opake but sometimes semitransparent It is fragile but its small fragments are so hard as to be capable of scratching agate It has no smell when breathed upon it has not any taste nor does it adhere to the tongue till it has been strongly ignited It does not become electrical or phosphorescent by heat or friction nor does it decrepitate before the blowpipe but loses its hardness and be comes quite opake Its specific gravity Mr Davy thinks does not exceed 270 water being considered as 100 The white and semitransparent specimens of this substance are soluble in the mineral acids and also in fixed alkaline lixivia with out effervescence but when coloured or opake specimens are ex posed to alkaline lixivia a small part remains undissolved A small transparent piece by being exposed to the greatest heat of a forge had its crystalline texture destroyed and was rendered opake but was not fused It now had lost more than onefourth of its weight and adhered strongly to the tongue neither water nor alcohol had any effect on this mineral When exposed in a glass tube to a heat of from 212 to 600 it gave out an elastic vapour which when condensed was a clear fluid having a slightly empy reumatic smell but not differing in taste from pure water The solution of this substance in sulphuric acid produced crystals in thin plates which had the properties of sulphate of alumine and from which when redissolved and mixed with potash octahedral crystals of alum were obtained The solid matter precipitated from the solution of this substance in muriatic acid was not acted upon by carbonate of ammonia con sequently it did not contain glucine or yttria Several experiments were made on the opake and coloured varieties of this mineral from which it appears that the substances which cause these varieties are calcareous earth manganese and oxide of iron Mr Davy then proceeded to the analysis of the mineral For this purpose he made use of the whitest and most transparent pieces he could obtain The particulars of this analysis we shall pass over and shall merely state that according to its general results 100 parts of the mineral contain of alumine 70 of lime 14 of fluid 262 the loss amounting to 24 which loss Mr Davy is inclined to attribute to some fluid remaining in the stone after the process of distillation5183 having found from several experiments that a red heat is not suffi cient to expell all the matter capable of being volatilized Mr Davy then made some experiments to determine whether any portion of fixed alkali existed in this mineral but no indications of such alkali could be observed The fluid obtained by distilling several different specimens of this mineral was similar in its properties the only test of the presence of acid matter in it was litmus paper and in some instances the ef fect upon this paper was scarcely perceptible Mr Davy made se veral experiments to determine the nature of the above acid matter but without success It is however he says evident that it is not any one of the known mineral acids he is also disposed to believe that it is not an essen tial component part of the mineral but that as well as the oxide of manganese the oxide of iron and the lime it is only an accidental ingredient Hence the mineral when in a state of purity must he thinks be considered as a chemical combination of about 30 parts of water and 70 of alumine The diaspore which has been examined by M Vauquelin loses 16 or 17 parts in the 100 by ignition and contains nearly 80 parts of alumine and 3 of oxide of iron It is supposed by M Vauquelin to be a compound of alumine and water But its characters are very different from those of the mineral here described and the nature of the part volatilized by heat has not yet been ascertained A mineral similar to that here treated of has been found near St Austle in Cornwall and Mr Davy has been informed that according to an analysis of it made by the Rev William Gregor it appears to consist of similar ingredients Dr Babington has proposed to call this mineral by the name of Wavellite from the gentleman who discovered it in Devonshire but if a name founded upon its chemical composition should be preferred Mr Davy thinks it may be denominated Hydrargillite Experiments on Wootz By Mr David Mushet Communzicated by the Right Hon Sir Joseph Banks KB PBS Read February 14 1805 Phil Trans 1805 p 163 The fine cakes of the kind of steel called Wootz which form the subject of the present paper were delivered to Mr Mushet for the purpose of examination by Sir Joseph Banks Mr Mushet begins his account of them by giving a very minute description of the form the grain and every other external character of these cakes This description cannot well be abridged and is too long to be repeated We shall therefore only say that Mr Mushet states as a general remark that the grain and density of these cakes of wootz were uni formly homogeneous and free from metallic iron towards the under or round surface but that they were always the reverse towards the upper side called by Mr Mushet the feeder The appearances observed upon forging these cakes are then par

j100276,Michigan Law Review,1276683,Evidence of Habit of Care Caution and Prudence as Negativing Contributory Negligence,i254500,NOTE AND COMMENT may be recovered for and ithat which may not but here we seem to have another point upon which conflicts will result in the interpretation of these two statutes W C M EVIDENCE OF HABIT OF CARE CAUTION AND PRUDENCE AS NEGATIVING CON RIBUTORY NEGLIGENCEIn an action for death by wrongful act when there were no eyewitnesses and no facts susceptible of proof to disclose how the fatality occurred the plaintiff having the burden of proof with regard to contributory negligence was allowed to prove the habits of the deceased as to care caution and prudence as tending to raise the presumption that he was in the exercise of due care and caution for his own safety at the time he was killed The Supreme Court of Illinois upheld this instruc tion saying As the proof made relative to the habits of the deceased tended to raise this presumption it was sufficient to go to the jury Casey v Chicago Rys Co Ill 1915 IO9 N E 984 The rule that in the absence of eyewitnesses and of proof of the cir cumstances surrounding the case from which the presence or absence of contributory negligence might be determined habit of care is admissible as tending to raise a presumption that there was no contributory negligence was laid down by the Illinois court in Chicago Rock Island  Pacific Ry Co v Clark Io8 Ill 113 and has been applied in a long line of Illinois decisions and more often probably than in any other state There is however a decided conflict in the holdings of the various courts which have been called upon to pass upon the question as to whether or not habit of care and habit of negligence are admissible to prove the absence or existence of contributory negligence The holding of the Illinois court finds support in California in Craven v Cent Pac R R Co 72 Cal 345 habit of negligence in Kansas in Missouri Pac Ry Co v Moffatt 6o Kansas 113 habit of care in New Hampshire in Parkinson v Nashua  Lowell R R Co 6I N H 416 habit of negligence Evans v Concord R R Corp 66 N H 194 habit of care and Lyman v B  M R R 66 N H 200 habit of care and in Rhode Island in Cassidy v Angell 12 R I 447 habit of care The contrary view seems to be held in Connecti cut in Morris v Town of East Haven 41 Conn 252 habit of care in Pennsylvania in Baker v Irish 172 Pa St 528 habit of negligence and in Wisconsin in Propsom v Leatham 80 Wis 608 habit of negligence though in all of these cases there seem to have been eyewitnesses under such circumstances even by the Illinois rule the evidence would not have been admitted but these courts do not seem to take this fact into consid eration whereas in Dalton v Chicago Rock Island  Pac Ry Co 114 lo 527 and Zucker v Whitridge 205 N Y 50 the court makes this dis tinction deciding merely that such evidence is not admissible where there are witnesses These holdings are not therefore contrary to the Illinois cases Both habit of care and habit of negligence would seem to fulfill the first requirement of admissibility i e they possess a distinct probative value 411MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW In everyday affairs such evidence is continually being considered weighed and acted upon by men of business Surely its probative value does not change when it is used in court As is said by McFarland J in Craven v Cent Pac R R Co supra A sensible man called upon out of court to determine whether or not a certain person had on a certain occasion care lessly jumped off a moving train of cars and finding the direct testimony as to the matter conflicting would naturally and properly give some weight to the fact that the person was not in the habit of alighting from cars in that manner and the consideration of such a fact in cases resembling the one at bar has frequently been sanctioned in court True it is the negli gence or care in the particular case with which the court is immediately concerned but evidence of habit of care or negligence is admissible only because and in so far as it tends to establish the one or the other and therefore it must be shown to amount to a habit and what is more a habit of action under similar circumstances WIGMORE  376 And as is said by MCFARLAND J in Craven v Cent Pac R R Co supra It may be remarked generally that unless the case falls within some wellrecog nized class of exceptions an evidentiary fact is relevant to the principal fact when the former tends to show that the latter probably did or did not occur and mere remoteness usually goes to weight and not to admissibility of evidence Granting the probative value of this evidence and limiting its admissi bility strictly to cases where the facts and circumstances upon which negli gence or lack of negligence must be predicated the soundness of which limitation may admit of some doubt is there any other reason why it should not be admitted Habit of care or negligence must not be confused with character evidence WIGMORE  92 97 The two are entirely different and are established in different manners and it is conceded that evidence of character is as a general rule inadmissible in civil cases The manner in which these two kinds of evidence are confused is illustrated in the case of Chase v Me Cent R R Co 77 Me 62 It remains to be considered whether or not this evidence might be ex cluded as raising a collateral issue as this is often assigned as a reason by those courts which exclude it The mere fact that it does raise an issue which is collateral to the principal issue in the case does not conclusively establish its inadmissibility Such evidence is many times admitted and when it is excluded it is usually because the detriment far outweighs the benefit i e the confusion produced cannot be outweighed by the probative value of the evidence sought to be introduced The probative value of the evidence in the instant case is obvious On principle therefore there seems to be no sound reason why evidence of habit or care and caution should not be admissible as tending to establish the absence of contributory negligence The argument herein made applies equally for its admissibility under similar conditions as tending to establish the absence of negligence on the part of the defendant The Illinois rule applied in the principal case would seem to be consonant with sound reason even if not in accord with the weight of authority W F W 412

applied Nevertheless the principles contended for herein are supported by a very respectable minority and by reasons that appear to us unanswerable It is evident too that many of the courts are growing restive under the inadequate test that precedent has laid down for them Accordingly it is confidently hoped that having now rested equity will soon take this next stride forward toward ultimate perfection H L W WHAT Is A DISCOUNTINGIf Smith is the holder of a negotiable note for 100000 due in one year he may go into the First National Bank indorse the note and transfer it to the cashier who would give him the face value less 6 for the time that the note had to run or 94000 Now this Smith would tell the first friend he encountered that he had discounted the note And the judge of the appellate court would upon seeing these facts on the record likewise pronounce this to have been a dis counting of the note But suppose that Smith had not indorsed the note Would that alter the nature of the transaction Or suppose that instead of getting 94000 for the note Smith had asked the cashier What will you give me for it The cashier after looking at the name on the paper would probably offer Smith 90000 Smith would then indorse the note and hand it to the cashier What is that transaction Is that a discounting In the first example of the transfer of the note which was agreed to be a discounting there where two elements a an in dorsement and b a price arrived at by figuring so much percent off the face value of the note for the time that it had to run Must both of these elements be present to constitute the transfer a discounting or only one Let us first look at the method of determining the price Is this counting off of a certain percentage a necessary element of a dis counting The ordinary man would I think say that it is Dis count is defined as a deduction made for interest in advancing money upon or purchasing a bill or note not due payment in advance of interest upon money1 Common sense would say that the verb to discount would mean nothing more than a transfer or a sale at a discount The idea of an advance in the nature of interest is in the lay mind inseparably connected with a discount ing And this argument from the common acceptance of the Eng lish language is in accord with the decisions reached in the ad judicated cases2 26 Supra note 1

v Third National 366There is a vast amount of contradictory dicta but very few actual decisions And of this latter group none is dangerous and only one in point3 In that case a bank bought a note at one dollar less than its face value which the court held to be a dis counting because the note was indorseda curious gambling of elements as we shall see No authority was cited except the definition of discount in Bouviers dictionary and an early Ken tucky case4 The remaining authority is only apparently contradictory Thus in a case where a bill was indorsed over to another at a lump sum or market price this was spoken of as a discount but the question before the court was whether or not the transaction was an attempt to evade the usury laws5 Again a bank au thorized only to discount bought a note at a fixed price and was allowed to recover on it but this was only under a Massachusetts doctrine that the holder of a promissory note need not have the legal title to it in order to sue on it6 The judge in his opinion points out that in the absence of that peculiar doctrine there could have been no recovery because the purchase at a fixed sum was be yond the powers of the bank7 In another case it was held that the purchase of a negotiable note at a lump sum was within the powers of a bank authorized to carry on the business of discounting notes8 A distinction was drawn between discounting and carrying on a banking business by discounting which latter was said to be always in the nature of a loan while we shall see that it seems doubtful if it could ever be a loan At any rate the Court sustained as proper for a bank with the first class of powers a transaction which concerned a note indorsed without recourse that really amounted to pure speculation in commercial paper The next year the Maryland Court followed this distinction and declared that it was beyond the power of a bank to purchase at a discount a note not indorsed by the holder when the banks charter only authorized it to carry on the business of banking by discounting promissory notes9 But this case is really in contradiction to the proposi tion that an essential element of a discounting is that the price must be figured on a percentage basis for the time that the instru Bank 142 Fed 25 73 C C A 211 1905 writ of certiorari denied 201 U S 649 50 L Ed 905 1906 Smith v Exchange Bank 26 Ohio St

particular transaction although characterized by the presence of this element was not a discount In fact the principal purpose of mentioning the case at all is to call attention to the excellence of the dissenting opinion which states that to be a discounting the consideration must be figured on a percentage basis But what about the necessity for an indorsement Is that also a requisite of a valid discounting By the better view it is not although the courts have become confused for the reason that an indorsement is usually made on a transfer at a discount But clearly if we revert to reason it would seem that an indorsement is nothing more than an usual incident Had the supposititious Smith transfered his note to the bank without assuming the in dorsers liability and received for the transfer the thousand dollars less a discount of six per cent he would no doubt have called it a discounting And so would any other reasonable layman for was it not a transaction at a discount The courts also hold this in the few cases in which there is no indorsement10 There is however much dicta to the contrary but only one adjudicated case11 and that has just been discussed and recommended for the excellence of its dissenting opinion While it appears that an indorsement is not a necessary element of a discounting it may be of interest to note the effect it has on the nature of a discounting If the transferor does not indorse or indorses without recourse the transaction in that case is in the nature of a sale or properly would be called a sale by way of discount12 But if the transferor indorses what then is the nature of the discounting Is it a purchase at a discount with a guarantee just as land sold is guaranteed by covenants of title Or is it a loan with the interest paid in advance and the paper taken as se curity The purchase of a claim payable at a fixed date for the face value less so much percent for the time it has to run and from one who guarantees payment is to all intents and purposes so closely allied to a loan on the claim purchased that it would not be profitable to draw any distinction and the cases therefore con stantly refer to this class of indorsed discounts as loansl3 and hold them to be within the usury laws14 To be strictly technical it should be remembered that the guarantee of the indorser is only conditional that although the effect of such a discounting may be the advance of money to the indorser still he is not the per son primarily liable for its repayment and indeed may never be liable at all Therefore it seems doubtful if a discounting can  Danforth v Bank supra Morrison v Springfield Third Nat Bank supra l Lazear v Nat Union Bank supra 12 McElwee v Collins supra Danforth v Bank supra Ex parte Roberts 2 Cox

amounts to such for all practical purposes while if unindorsed it is a purchase at a discount Granting that it might be a loan whether or not a given discounting is a loan or a purchase would really depend in each case on the intent of the partiesan intent of which they would hardly be conscious themselves and which no court could be ex pected to determine under existing means of proof Whatever may be the purely logical side in practical effect the discounting of an indorsed note amounts to a loan and to hold such a transaction without the scope of the usury laws would be to furnish an easy way of evading them15 Of course where the statute puts a limit on the rate of discount there is no need to in dulge in the purely academic distinction as to whether or not the discounting in question be a loan or a purchase All discounts transcending the terms of the statute incur the penalty therein provided Now if the bank pays Smith 94000 for his note what differ ence does it make whether Smith and the cashier arrived at the price by deducting the interest from the face value or by ordinary bargaining Why is this distinction drawn It becomes important for two reasons In the first place as we have just seen a dis count is within the laws regulating lawful interest while a pur chase at a market price is not So the nature of the transaction may be of vital importance to one seeking recovery on a transfer where there was a great discrepancy between the face value and the price paid But the most important result of this distinction is reached in the case of banks It is clearly desirable that banks should not be speculators in papermere note shaving institutions It is also obviously necessary that they should have the power to acquire valid paper and advance money thereon To prevent the evil and secure the advantage of negotiating notes bills etc National Banks and most State Banks are authorized to discount 16 at a specific rate17 but are forbidden to buy and sell in an ordinary market18 If no such limits are set in the charter then the general laws of that jurisdiction regulating interest apply This double safeguard effectively prevents note shaving and speculating in evi dences of debt while it allows banks to advance money at a profitable rate on good negotiable paper B C s See dissenting opinion of the Chancellor Cram v Hendricks 7 Wend N Y 569 1831 for an

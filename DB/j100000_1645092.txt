j100000,Science,1645092,An Important but Unnamed Radioactive Quantity,i296715,AN IMPORTANT BUT UNNAMED RADIOACTIVE QUANTITY THE problems that are met in the quanti tative study of radioactive materials and proc esses fall naturally into two classes One class includes the strictly chemical problems the other the problems that are primarily con cerned with radioactive phenomena such as the rate of emission of energy and the rate of production of alpha particles In problems be longing to the first class we are concerned with the total amount of material present but in problems of the second class we are directly concerned with only the relatively small frac tion MN of the atoms present that take part in the phenomenon studied we are only in cidentally interested in the atoms that have remained untransformed In such problems comparable amounts of different radioelements are such as correspond to the same value of AN There should be a name by which to denote the amount of any radioelement irrespective of family that is thus comparable to a gram of radium If tentatively we use the letter r to denote this quantity then an r of any material may be defined as that amount of the material that will produce transformed atoms at the same rate as transformed atoms are produced by one gram of radium This quantity plays in radioactivity a part that is analogous to that played by the grammolecule in physical chem istry and the adoption of some name for it will facilitate the recording discussion and presentation of observations and phenomena Thus arises the question whether the term  curie which denotes an r of radium emana tion shall be redefined so as to cover the entire field embraced by our definition of the quan tity r or whether a new name shall be added to the nomenclature of the science This question was submitted by the Bureau of Standards to a number of chemists and physi cists the majority of those who replied fa vored a redefinition of the  curie The advantages to be secured by adopting a name for the quantity here denoted by r are considered in greater detail in an article that will appear in an early issue of the Jour nal of the Washington Academy of Sciences N ERNEST DORSEY BUREAN OP STANDARDS WASHINGTON D 0 July 30 1921

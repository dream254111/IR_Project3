The facts adduced in that case established that the Medical Company who sold directly to the retailers took from each retailer to whom it sold a contract by which the retailer agreed to sell all articles at the regular retail prices which were to be indicated from time to time by the Med ical Company The Medical Company did not maintain retail es tablishments and it was obvious that the retailers could not use the goods obtained in competition with the retained business of the Medical Company The sole operation of the contracts was to op press the retailer without a corresponding benefit to the Medical Company and to secure to the Medical Company an arbitrary con trol of prices on the retail market The court properly held that the contract imposed an improper and unreasonable restraint upon trade and was therefore void under the federal AntiTrust Act It seems however that the reasoning in the opinion makes the na ture of such contracts as being ancillary or principal depend upon the necessity for protection to the retained business which as in dicated above seems erroneous While the test to be applied in passing upon contracts to control prices should not be affected by the circumstance that a particular contract is not one of a general system it seems to have been sug gested that this fact may serve to reconcile some of the hostile de cisions12 But this is plainly unsound for while a single contract in restraint of trade may not appreciably affect the public it is equally as obnoxious on principle as one which forms a part of a general system and should be held invalid unless it is ancillary to a principal contract of sale and reasonably necessary to protect the retained business IMPRISONMENT FOR REFUSAL TO EARN MEANS OF PAYING ALI MONYThe peculiar power of a court of equity to enforce its de crees by contempt proceedings has been very generally exercised in giving effect to decrees for alimony It has been strongly urged in opposition to this power that to commit one to prison for nonpayment of alimony where the defendant has sufficient funds in his possession is in contravention of the prohibition contained in most state constitutions against imprisonment for debt This con tention has been successfully refuted however both by reason of the fact that such punishment is applied because of the willful dis obedience of a decree of the court1 and because a decree awarding alimony does not establish a mere technical debt within the mean ing of such constitutional prohibitions but determines a legal duty 12 This is probably the significance of the statement in Park  Sons Co v Hartman supra that The reasons which might uphold covenants restricting the liberty of a single buyer might prove quite inadequate when there are a multitude of identical agreements A single covenant might in no way affect the public interest when a large number might Blake v People 80 111 11 NOTES 4014IRGINIA LAW REVIEW or relation in which not only immediate parties but the public gen erally are interested2 In determining what alimony should be awarded the courts have always held that the earning capacity of the husband is a proper element to take into consideration The husbands duty to main tain his wife does not depend solely on his having visible property but his capacity for earning must be estimated3 Admitting that earning capacity is a proper element to be con sidered in awarding alimony and that a decree of alimony is en forceable by contempt proceedings the courts seem to have hesi tated much in admitting the logical deduction that if alimony is de creed against one having no property he can be imprisoned for con tempt for the nonpayment of alimony when caused by his failure to work and earn money with which to discharge the alimony The courts in thus denying themselves the right to punish one for contempt who having no property has made no bona fide at tempt to work and earn money with which to discharge the ali mony have rested their decision on two grounds First because it is said that if the court could punish one by imprisonment for not earning money with which to pay a decree for alimony it could do so to enforce the payment of any other judgment4 The fallacy of this reasoning lies in the fact that a decree for alimony as pointed out above is essentially different from an ordinary judg ment The second reason for refusal to punish as for contempt in such a case is the difficulty of obtaining the desired result it being said that to imprison for not working would in no way better the situation5 While this is a strong reason against punishing for con tempt in such a case it is submitted that such a reason does not go to the power of the court to punish and that it should not be allowed to control As stated in some of the adjudged cases if the defendant is under the stress of attachment he may discern ways and means of earning money that were once hidden from him it may entirely change his disposition toward work6 2 Lyon v Lyon 21 Conn 185 Brouk v State 43 Fla 461 31 South 248 99 Am St Rep 119 State v King 49 La Ann 1503 22 South 887 Carlton v Carlton 44

In Ex parte Todd 119 Cal 57 50 Pac 1071 it was held without giving any reasons that the court had no power to punish one for contempt for not working and earning money in order to pay alimony  Bleckley J in Lestcr v Lester 63 Ga 357 speaking of the right of the court to punish one having no visible property for not paying alimony says Under the stress of attachment even the vision of the respondent himself may be cleared and brightened so that he will discern ways and means which were once hidden from him or seen ob scurely It is a great help to do a thing to feel that it must be done and that there is no evading it 402NOTES Whatever may be the wisdom of the rule that a man without property who makes no reasonable effort to work and pay the sum directed in an order for alimony cannot be punished for contempt upon strict legal reasoning the court may under such circumstances punish for contempt and it has been so held7 Upon considera tion of the fact that contempt proceedings are within the wise dis cretion of the court it would seem that on principle the court should have the right to punish one for contempt for not working and paying the alimony as decreed In the recent decision of Fowler v Fowler Okla 161 Pac 227 the court after an examination of both reason and authority held that an ablebodied man who made no bona fide effort to se cure employment in order to pay alimony awarded against him even though he had no property may be punished for contempt WHEN A DEED ABSOLUTE ON ITS FACE WILL BE CONSTRUED TO BE A MORTGAGEUnder the old common law when land was con veyed as security for a debt unless the debtor complied strictly with the terms of the instrument of conveyance title to the whole property vested immediately in the creditor upon default On ac count of the severity of the case on the generally oppressed debtor equity gradually assumed jurisdiction and gave the debtor addi tional time after the forfeiture within which to redeem his estate This right known as the equity of redemption is the character istic feature of mortgages The equity of redemption is not lost until the mortgagee forecloses the mortgage in a proper proceeding in equity and even then only a sufficient sum is taken from the proceeds of the sale to satisfy the debt the surplus going back to the mortgagor2 Many attempts have been made by creditors to defeat the equity of redemption incident to a transfer of property as security for a debt by making the transaction in form a conditional sale or even an absolute conveyance But no matter what the form of the trans action may be if it is in essence a mortgage equity will so hold3 A mortgage is always for the security of some obligation and hence if the conveyance is intended to secure an existing debt it is necessarily a mortgage4 But the law does not prohibit condi  Lester v Lester supra Staples v Staples 89 Wis 592 58 N W 1036 24 L R A 433 See Muse v Muse 84 N C 35 1See POWELL MORTGAGES p 108 2

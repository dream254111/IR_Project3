NEAR TO ESTABLISHING THE PRINCIPLE SUGGESTED IN NOTE TO ILUBBLE V POFF 6 VA LAW REG 557 558 THAT WHERE IT APPEARS FROM THE FACE OF A DECLARATION UNDER LORD CAMPBELLS ACT VA CODE SEC 2902 THAT THE ACTION IS NOT BROUGHT WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS AS PRESCRIBED ADVANTAGE MAY BE TAKEN OF THE LIMITATION BY DEMURRER IF SO THE RULING IS AN IMPORTANT ONE AND THE POINT IS ONE OF FIRST IMPRESSION IN THIS STATE THOUGH IT WAS REFERRED TO OBITEI IN MCCARTNEY V TYRER 94 VA 198 THE REFERENCE HOWEVER TO A REPLICATION IN ADVOIDANCE OF THE LIMITATION WOULD INDICATE THAT THERE WAS ALSO A PLEA SETTTING UP THE LAPSE OF THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THIS REPLICATION WAS DEMURRED TO AS WAS THE DECLARATION AND BOTH DEMURRERS WERE SUSTAINED BY THE LOWER COURT THE APPELLATE COURT APPROVES THE ACTION OF THE LOWER COURT BUT CONFINES ITS DISCUSSION TO THE PROPRIETY OF THIS REPLICATION THE OPINION HOLDS THAT  THE JUDGMENT IS PLAINLY RIGHT ON THE GROUND THAT THE CASE DOES NOT COME WITHIN THE SAVING CLAUSE OF SEC 2934 OF THE CODE RELIED UPON IN THE REPLICATION THAT IS TO SAY AS IT WOULD SEEM THE REAL DECISION IN THE CASE IS THAT THE DEMURRER TO THE REPLICATION WAS PROPERLY SUSTAINED THE READER WILL NATURALLY INQUIRE HOW THE QUESTION COULD HAVE ARISEN IN THE LOWER COURT AS TO THE PROPRIETY OF THE REPLICATION AFTER THE DEMURRER TO THE DECLARA TION WAS SUSTAINED WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE RECORD AND CANNOT EXPLAIN 1901

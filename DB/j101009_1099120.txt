500 there is in ordinary cases no good reason why B may not take out a policy for considerably more than this amount on As life Not only is B interested in securing the principal but the interest which may at the debtors death have equalled or exceeded the principal Furthermore the premiums which B pays mayand will in case A lives out his expectation of life since the rates are fixed to accomplish this very resultin themselves exceed the face of the policy B is interested therefore in securing 1 The principal 2 The interest thereon possibly exceeding the principal and 3 The premiums possibly and in average cases certainly exceeding the face of the policy Hence in reason and by authority a creditor in insuring the life of his debtor is not con fined to the amount of the debt See

WESTErrN RY Co Supreme Court of Appeals At Richmond January 31 1901 1 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONSDeath by wrongqfl actDemurrer Where the declaration in an action for death by wrongful act shows on its face that the death occurred more than twelve months before action brought advantage may be taken of the limitation by demurrer 2 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONSDeath by uronqful actSecond action after voluntary nonsuitCode sees 2919 2934 Neither the provisions of Code sec 2919 as amended nor of sec 2934 as amended are applicable to a second action for death by wrongful act where the first action was brought in due time but resulted in a voluntary nonsuit Upon a petition for a writ of error to a judgment of the Circuit Court of Warren county Denied Per curiam The plaintiffs decedent is alleged to have lost his life by the negligence of the defendant on the 27th day of July 1898 His administrator qualified on the 16th day of January 1899 and instituted an action for damages for the killing on the 19th day of the same month There was a mistrial at the February term of the court The case was continued at the May term At the October term of the court a juror was withdrawn and upon motion of the plaintiff he 776 MarchMANUEL V N  W RY CO was nonsuited because of the absence of a material witness and judg ment entered for costs The plaintiff afterwards instituted another action for the same injury The declaration on its face showed that the second action was instituted more than twelve months after the injury sued for The court sustained a demurrer to it and also to a replication in which the proceedings in the former action were stated and dismissed the action on the ground that the action had not been commenced within the time required by section 2903 of the Code Its judgment is plainly right This case does not come within the provisions of section 2934 of the Code as amended by act approved Feb ruary 8 1898 Acts 18978 p 252 nor section 2919 as amended by act approved February 12 1896 Acts 18956 p 331 Where an action is brought within the statutory period and after the expiration of that period the plaintiff is nonsuited upon his own motion the statute of limitations is a bar to another action for the same cause Angel on Lim sec 328 Barino v MeGhee 3 S C 452 Braxton v Woods 4 Gratt 256 Writ of error denied NOTEThe action of the court in this case comes near to establishing the principle suggested in note to Ilubble v Poff 6 Va Law Reg 557 558 that where it appears from the face of a declaration under Lord Campbells Act Va Code sec 2902 that the action is not brought within twelve months as prescribed advantage may be taken of the limitation by demurrer If so the ruling is an important one and the point is one of first impression in this State though it was referred to obitei in McCartney v Tyrer 94 Va 198 The reference however to a replication in advoidance of the limitation would indicate that there was also a plea settting up the lapse of the prescribed period This replication was demurred to as was the declaration and both demurrers were sustained by the lower court The appellate court approves the action of the lower court but confines its discussion to the propriety of this replication The opinion holds that  the judgment is plainly right on the ground that the case does not come within the saving clause of sec 2934 of the Code relied upon in the replication That is to say as it would seem the real decision in the case is that the demurrer to the replication was properly sustained The reader will naturally inquire how the question could have arisen in the lower court as to the propriety of the replication after the demurrer to the declara tion was sustained We have not seen the record and cannot explain 1901

pluralistic theory of the state Roughly speak ing we may identify the pluralistic theory as that theory which denies the logical validity and the practical and moral adequacy of the traditional doctrine of state sovereignty or of the doc trines of sovereignty which have prevailed since the eras of Bodin and Hobbes and have in a peculiar degree dominated political thought since the time of John Austin Although the pluralist dogma does not take precisely the same form for all of its adherents views held in common by them all are to be found in the chief criticisms which they offer against what they regard as the now prevailing notions of state authority and competence The pluralists maintain that sovereignty is not in any commu nity indivisible and they deny that the state either is or ought to be sovereign in any absolute or unique sense They cite many facts of recent political and social experience to discredit the belief that the state does persistently exercise sovereignty over other essential social groups they argue that the tendency of social and industrial change today is in the direction of a progressive weakening and narrowing of state power and they hold that the effect of a still further disintegration and decen tralization of authority will be to improve the economic moral and intellectual wellbeing of man and society We can not here explore at length the genesis of current pluralistic doctrines Briefly they appear to be in part the I An excellent analysis of recent pluralistic theory is that contained in the sympathetic though at some points adverse criticism by Miss M P Follet in chapters 2832 of her yolume the New State New York 1918 The article by Miss E D Ellis on The Pluralistic State American Political Science Review August 1920 pp 393407 presents another useful exposition and criticism of the doctrine 186TECHNIQUE OF THE PLURALISTIC STATE 187 culmination of a trend in legal theorychiefly from Germany and Englandconfirmed and modified by a later and somewhat parallel trend in economic doctrinechiefly from France The latter movement in economic doctrine is to be sketched later in this article under the heading  Syndicalism In the former field we have the theory of the real personality of corporate associations within the state The German jurist Otto Gierke writing about half a century ago developed not only the his torical aspects of this conception but maintained that correct political theory requires that we regard the personality of certain essential corporate associations not as artificial or fictitious as a mark to be granted or withheld by a sovereign state but as real and natural inhering in such associations and evolving inde pendently of and prior to state action2 In England this view was developed by F W Maitland who in similar terms insisted upon the real personality the spontaneous origin the inherent rights of corporate bodies within the State3 Still later Dr J Neville Figgis although his practical interest has been primarily in the rights of ecclesiastical groups has maintained the rights of associations generally against the prevailing creed of state omnipotence4 The writings of Figgis present perhaps more effectively than any other writings the doctrine that the smaller communities and lesser associations within the state possess a corporate life arising naturally and inevitably from the associa tional instincts of mankind and his writings eloquently oppose the efforts of statesmen and lawyers to invade the proper spheres of these associations and to prevent their development according to their inherent spirit and tendency He opposes the notion which regards the state and the individual as the only political entities and divides activities into publicthose of the state and privatethose of individuals and associationsand he 2 The views of Gierke appear in his Das Genossenschaftsrecht 1868 and his Die Genossenschaftstheorie 1887 3 Maitlands views are found in his introduction to his translation of Gierkes Political Theories of the Middle Ages Cambridge 1900 a translation of a section of the Genossenschaftsrecht and in various passages in his Collected Papers 4 For Figgis view see especially his Churches in the Modern State London and New York 1913188 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW maintains that the collective activities of individuals through such organizations as churches and trade unions partake more of the nature of public than of private activities He characterizes the state as an ascending hierarchy of groups family school county union church etc etc5 The ideas of Gierke Maitland and Figgis supply the starting point for the pluralistic theory But their own doctrines are not fundamentally pluralistic The state is not by them represented as one among a number of equal or coordinate associations They recognize the distinctive function and superior authority of the state as an agency of coordination and adjustment The state is the communitas communitatum According to Figgis one of the chief elements in the importance of the various smaller groups is that they foster not only individual development but also loyalty to the great society of societies which we call the State6 Each of these groups must by the state be restrained from acts of injustice towards one another or towards individ uals and  it is largely to regulate such groups and to ensure that they do not outstep the bounds of justice that the coercive force of the State exists7 Such views should be characterized as doctrines of political federalism rather than of political pluralism But the influence of such views upon the ideas of the pluralists is unmistakable and the connection is insisted upon by the plural ists As leading representatives of the latter we may take Leon Duguit in France and Harold J Laski for this country and England Their views have been so frequently reviewed that no elaborate analysis of the more formal aspects of their systems is now necessary The state according to Duguit8 is not sovereign because it is subject to limitations and these limitations are not merely 5 Figgis Churches in the Modern State p 87 6 Ibid  p 49 7 Ibid 8 The pluralistic theory of Duguit is set forth in parts of almost all of his works See especially his Manuel du Droit Constitutionnel 2nd ed 1911 and his Trans formations du Droit Public 1913 The latter work has been translated by Frida and Harold Laski under the title Law in the Modern State New York 1919 this translation is marred by numerous errors in renditionTECHNIQUE OF THE PLURALISTIC STATE 189 moral limitations The state is subject to law droit Law is not the creation of the state it is superior to and anterior to the state The basis of law is social solidarity or social inter dependence by virtue of the fact that men have common needs whose satisfaction can not be assured except by social life and different aptitudes which can supply such needs only by a reciprocal exchange of services men in society are subject to certain rules of conduct These rules embody a general obliga tion to do nothing which weakens social solidarity and to do everything which tends to realize and develop social solidarity9 Expressed more concretely the state is subject to definite obliga tions of a legal or jural juridique sort For law is merely an expression of the demands of social opinion to formulate and enforce such demands being the special task of the state The state is subject to legal limitation because social opinion does as a clear matter of fact demand that certain tasks be accomplished by the state that certain public services be organized in such way as to avoid all dislocations Moreover Duguit maintains that there is no such thing as a national will and no such thing as a single sovereign organiza tion expressing and executing the decisions of a supposed national will He admits that the earlier typical functions of the state were such as perhaps required for their due fulfillment the notion of a supreme power issuing commands and exerting only coercion to enforce its commands political functions were primarily those of justice police and defence But the business of the state today goes far beyond the provision of such services govern ment is now called upon to perform a variety of activities necessary to the development of individual wellbeing and in fulfilling these newer tasksmany of them of an industrial char actergovernments most important acts are no longer essen tially related to the power to command and coerce which is the distinctive quality of sovereignty As the characteristic attri bute of the state today the idea of public service must replace the idea of sovereignty Whatever power the state may legiti Duguit Manuel du Droit Constitutionnel pp 4951 6979 10 Duguit Transformations du Droit Public chs 13190 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW mately exert it possesses only by virtue of the relation of such power to the provision of public services in response to social needs the acts of those who govern create no obligation and have no legal validity save as they contribute to such an end1l Those who govern are simply managers of the nations business2 Thus no organ of the state is sovereign and the imposition of restraint is not the typical means whereby the state secures its ends Laskis main criticisms are directed against two alleged prin ciples of the prevailing theory of state sovereignty first that the power of the state over individuals or smaller social groups is actually absolute and secondly that the state is morally entitled to its assumed position of preeminence in society In Laskis attack he thus in the first place shows with great ease that there is never in any community any one source of authority which is certain of unvarying obedience There are always things which the state does not do and can not do because of opposition from the conscience or will of some part of the com munity In the second place the state has as compared with other social groups no superior claim to the individuals alle giance The state is only one among many forms of human association A church or trade union may properly be of fully as much practical and moral importance to an individual and as much in harmony with the end of society as the state is The state should recognize this it is not morally justified in trying to impose by force its special demands when there is conflict between its objects and those of other organizations within the community In case of such conflicting demands the state should seek only to win allegiance by reason and moral suasionnot by physical compulsion Its preeminence over other associations in any occasion of conflict depends solely upon its superior claim in that particular instance 11 Duguit Transformations du Droit Public introduction and ch 2 12 Duguit Law in the Modern State p 51 13 Laskis general theory is found chiefly in his Problem of Sovereignty New Haven 1917 especially chapter 1 and appendix A and his Authority in the Modern State New Haven 1919 especially chapter 1 14 Laski Authority in the Modern State p 65TECHNIQUE OF THE PLURALISTIC STATE 191 Laski thus unlike Duguit hardly concerns himself at all with the question of the legal power of the state He does not consider it worth while to assail the states claim to legal sov ereignty He seeks to disparage state importance in this matter not by denying legal sovereignty but by asserting its unimpor tance the concept of legal sovereignty is he holds a barren concept merely legal sovereignty is without practical utility5 How do Duguit and Laski show the actual working of the pluralistic theory What are the evidences which they offer to prove that within any community there is no single organization of supreme authority and that state power is now a variously limited power For the most part Duguit finds his evidences within the field of governmental action although they are greatly varied here He does not primarily desire to emphasize the significance and dignity of nonpolitical social groups his main effort is to show first that the making of statutory law loi is not the exclusive prerogative of any one organ in the state and secondly that each organ of state action is a legally limited agent or because it logically should be is in the way of becoming such His evidences chiefly from the operation of the French governmental system are presented under three main heads 1 the nature and origin of the statutes lois of the state 2 the judicial limitations upon administrative action 3 the developing recog nition of the principle of state responsibility Concerning statutes he maintains that the obligation to obey statutes and the right to enforce them rest not upon their supposed sovereign origin but upon the fact that the statutes embody rules which are the formal expression of social facts in other words statutory laws are obligatory in character not because of their sovereign origin but because of the objective ends which they serve To prove this he shows that in France agencies other than Parlia ment issue general commands accepted by the court as legally valid if directed towards legally valid ends He cites such examples as the following the power of the President of the 15 Laski Problem of Sovereignty p 269 16 Duguit Transformations du Droit Public chs 37192 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW Republic to issue independent ordinances unrelated to the execution of statutes passed by Parliament the power of com munal authorities to issue local ordinances sustained by penal sanctions the power of local administrative authorities to enter into statutory agreements loisconventions of a noncontractual character with utility companies the power of civil servants in some governmental departments and institutions to participate in the general direction and control of the respective depart ments or institutions Duguits examples of judicial limitation on administrative discretion are so obvious and unimportant that we are not justified in analyzing them here The same can be said of his demonstration of the development of state responsibility where he cites judicial decisions holding administrative officials person ally liable for injurious acts done out of relation to the duties of their respective offices or points to instances of the acceptance by the state itself of liability for injurious acts of its administra tive agents done within their competence and done without fault or finally points to a tendency on the part of the Council of State to declare and on the part of Parliament to acknowledge the existence of a responsibility of Parliament in cases where injury is suffered by private parties from acts of Parliament placing restrictions in the interest of the public upon private activities not in themselves noxious It is difficult to perceive relevancy or force in the instances described by Duguit to demonstrate the actual working in France of his pluralistic hypothesis In the first place most of his examples of legally limited authority relate to obviously sub ordinate governmental agents exercising delegated powers In the second place where reference is made to legal obligations resting upon higher authorities more immediately representative of the state he indicates no means of defining or enforcing such obligations indeed he acknowledges that there is in most cases no method for compelling even inferior officials to conform to decisions of the Council of State nullifying their acts on the ground of ultra vires or abuse of power Finally throughout all his discussion he disregards any distinction between stateTECHNIQUE OF THE PLURALISTIC STATE 193 and government and even if he be not held strictly to a dis crimination between these two terms yet he generally admits that the notion of the limitedness and responsibility of Parlia ment an organ of government is not an ideal that has as yet in any clear way received formal recognition7 The instances discussed by Laski to prove his contention that the source of ultimate control in society is plural not single are drawn from a somewhat more varied field In his Problem of Sovereignty his reference for evidence is mainly to three great religious movements in Great Britain in the nineteenth century each of them arising from the efforts of a strong religious group within the nation to assert against the states opposition its claim to the right of selfcontrol free from interference by the tribunals of the state and each conflict resulting in a victory for the religious organizationthat is in the acknowledgment by the state that such corporations are in their respective spheres autonomous groups within the nation At various points in this work as well as in his later volumes and shorter essays Laski refers more widely to frequent instances of actual state impotence against resisting groups or even resisting individuals within the nation as proofs that the idea of the sovereign state is an untenable and futile doctrine In what practical sense he says in effect can the British Parliament be said to be sov ereign when it dared not attempt to enforce the antistrike pro vision of the munitions act against the defiant Welsh miners or if Ulster could in 1914 refuse with impunity to accept the sovereignty of an act of Parliament granting home rule to Ire land or if many individuals successfully refused to obey the military service act of 1916 Of what validity or importance 17 Some of the difficulties in Duguits discussion may be due to the varying meanings and connotations of the French term droit and the English law Where he urges the existence of a regle de droit superior to the state he appar ently means something more than a moral principle but it is not clear that he means an officially declared rule of law as is implied in Diceys well known phrase If regle de droit is translated as rule of justice the ambiguity of the French phrase may be indicated and the same problem will arise whether such a standard can be something more than a moral principle without being iden tified with the law officially declared by the organs of the state Ed194 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW is a doctrine which attributes sovereignty to an authority which is compelled by groups other than itself to adopt policies to which it is opposed or which may even find it necessary to respect the consciences and prejudices of unorganized individuals My own first response to Laskis argument would be that so far as I know there has never been any political philosopher of any school in any era who would attempt to deny such facts as those adduced by Laski relating to the actual limits to state power or who I believe would be much disturbed by such facts And certainly extremely few have been the theorists or statesmen who have not acknowledged that there were moral or rational as well as actual physical limits to state competence Take such typical exponents of the traditional sovereignty theory as Bodin Grotius and Bentham each of them recognizes the moral limits of state authority And Hobbes whom Laski calls that prince of monistic thinkers points out that there are certain demands upon the subject that the legal and political sovereign can not rationally make because the subject can not rationally be supposed to have surrendered the rights of self determination in such matters John Austin whom also plural ists put forward as a representative par excellence of the monists defines the sovereign only as the determinate human superior who receives habitual not necessarily invariable obedience from the bulk not necessarily from every particular unit of a given society and he devotes several pages in his compact discussion of sovereignty to an analysis of the limits of sovereign power9 Finally let me quote the following two statements of Laskis views In almost every independent political society there are principles or maxims expressly adopted or tacitly accepted by the sovereign and which the sovereign habitually observes The cause of this observance commonly lies in the regard which is entertained for those principles or maxims by the bulk or most influential part of the community or it may be that those principles or maxims have been adopted from a perception of 18 Laski Problem of Sovereignty p 25 19 Austin Lectures on Jurisprudence I secs 190 254ffTECHNIQUE OF THE PLURALISTIC STATE 195 utility or from a belief of their conformity to the Divine will And speaking of any part of any government Like the sovereign body of which it is a member it is obliged or restrained morally by opinions and sentiments current in the given community These two statements embodying Laskis view are not from Laski but from Austins Jurisprudence20 And who but such rare publicists as Blackstone and Treitschke have sought to exalt state importance in any such degree as Laski at times conceives nonpluralists generally to do In attempting this brief illustration of contemporary plural istic theory it has seemed proper to devote chief attention to Duguit and Laski both because they are probably the best known exponents of the doctrine and because they are the most emphatic in asserting the fundamental divergence of their doctrine from the monistic theory But we have not put an end to the matter of political pluralism versus political monism by showing that Duguit and Laski have probably misunderstood both the meaning and the practical and moral implications of the prevailing doctrine of sovereignty or by arguing that the evidences which they assemble to support their theoretical assaults are not relevant or effective For in the first place there are other authors who though they set forth doctrines having in main points the same practical tendency as the notions of Duguit and Laski are yet perhaps clearer and more discrimi nating in the explanations of the relations of their doctrines to the monistic theory Several writers in Europe and America have set forth systems which though they do not assail the theoretical foundation of state sovereignty are yet pluralistic in political aspect in that they point to or call for a greater diversification in the organi zation for the initiation and execution of state policy than the prevailing theory is ordinarily taken to imply For example in France Maurice Hauriou attempts in his constitutional treatises 20 Austin Lectures on Jurisprudence I secs 248 and 254 21 Hauriou Principles de Droit Public 2nd ed 1916 pp 32ff Cf also Berth6l emy Le Fondement de lAutorit6 Politique Revue du Droit Public Vol 32 1915 pp 662682196 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW to differentiate between political sovereignty residing in the agencies of governmentincluding in democracies the electo rate and juridical sovereignty residing in the people generally and manifested in general through their power of accepting or refusing to accept voluntarily or of refusing to cooperate actively in the execution of governmental commands which they consider unjust and in particular through the indispen sable cooperation by the people in the enforcement of criminal law as through the jury system In this country Miss M P Follet has directed attention to the increasing importance of group life and she advocates a policy which though leaving ultimate state sovereignty undisturbed would accept and encourage the active political functioning of various groups such as trade unions professional associations and neighbor hood societies Various sociologists notably Durkheim have criticized the existing political structure on the ground of its inadaptability and inadequacy as the exclusive regulative factor in the complex industrial society of today They would create a new more flexible organization which however they would not substitute for but rather add to or insert into the state industrial control would then be divided between the state and the new organization constructed on an occupational basis the state to remain as the supervising and ultimately sovereign authority22 In the second place besides these various theoretical systems there are attacks of a practical sort which are pluralistic in tendency in that they champion the causes of social groups within the community in conflicts between these groups and state authority or in that they seek to distribute political con trol among various interests or strive in other ways to create a more decentralized system for the application of political authority There are various contemporary movements which in France and England at least are supported by men and groups of impressive strength and vision and whose purposes are to make substantial modifications in the existing geographi 22 See Barnes Durkheims

structure modifications which would make political control more diffuse by creating more manifold bases of political representation or which would make social control more diffuse by withdrawing altogether from state control certain fields of social action now claimed by most states to be within their competence These movements have historical and theoretical relations that we can not consider here We may sketch briefly certain contemporary projects for reform that illustrate the tendencies just described and only to indicate the relations of such projects to the doctrine of state sovereignty not to appraise their practical or moral value For this purpose we can consider very briefly the fol lowing the movements for 1 professional representation or the representation of interests 2 administrative democracy or administrative syndicalism 3 regionalism and distributivism 4 guild socialism 5 syndicalism The order in which we consider them is determined roughly by the degree to which they tend to a real division of ultimate political control pro ceeding from the less to the more pluralistic At least the last two aim at a more radical dislocation of the existing system of control than do the first three Regionalism and Distributivism Certain movements of reac tion against the allabsorbing centralized state are in the direction of a greater localization of political and economic control in agreement with other critics of the existing politicoeconomic structure they seek a broader distribution of political and eco nomic control but they seek this in a territorial rather than in a functional division Here we have the regionalist school in France and the distributivist school in England The regionalist movement in France comprises various pro jects for the redefinition of existing areas in order to make them logical units of social feeling and economic life and for the de volution of many existing government functions to these reconstructed local areas Their aim is to preserve popular self government against the encroachments of remote unrepresenta tive overwhelming governmental authority not by restricting the functions of government generally but by narrowing the198 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW territorial areas in which government normally acts Their remedy is offered as a cure for the extravagance confusion irresponsibility and generally undemocratic character of the present highly centralized system of French administration For a century there have been efforts to enlarge the scope of powers of the existing local agenciesparticularly the depart mental general council and the communal council For over half a century schemes for a more comprehensive and radical reorganization and territorial decentralization of the adminis trative system have been earnestly advocated and have been supported by distinguished authors of various political schools including Ducroq CasimirPerier Jules Favre Paul Deschanel and Ribot The movement has given origin to numerous organi zations The present regionalist movement may be said to have been officially launched at the Congress of Nancy in 1865 This was followed by many other conferences and organizations culminating in the formation in 1900 of the French Regionalist Federation This was followed in 1913 by the League of Pro fessional Representation and Regionalist Action under the leader ship of Jean Hennessy president of the league leader of the move ment in the Chamber of Deputies and author of several works describing the movement The plan of this league calls for the creation of new areas larger than the present departements the governing body in each area would be composed of representa tives elected by professional and economic groups within the area and upon it would devolve the autonomous exercise of many administrative and subsidiary legislative functions now under the active control of the central government23 The dogmas of the British distributivists headed by Hilaire Belloc have more of an economic color They are twoindividual ownership of property and voluntary cooperation in small com munity areas rather than on broader district or national lines 23 For description and discussion of the regionalist movement consult the fol lowing Charles Brun Le Regionalisme 1911 Jean Hennessy

a system of small selfgoverning communities of indi vidual property owners each individual making his contribution of labor and produce to the community on the basis not of status or compulsion but of free contract According to Belloc24 this is the system which in the later middle ages in western Europe was under the influence of the Catholic Church gradually devel oping in place of the pagan servile state in which those who labored worked under compulsion of the law or of their slave status In that medieval system the villa and the guild were the fundamental units of production and of social and political life in each production was regulated by selfgoverning corpo rations of small owners25 From the tenth to the sixteenth century there was a gradual loss by the workers of the villa of their original servile character and there was a gradual devel opment of what was in effect freehold or absolute possession of the soil In the towns the craft and trading guilds jealously safeguarded the division of property so that there should be found within their ranks no proletariat upon the one side and no monopolizing capitalist upon the other26 This ideal con dition of society was in the nonCatholic countries at any rate supplanted by a society based on capitalism which is an unstable system because it conflicts with all existing or possible systems of law and because of its intolerable effects in denying suffi ciency and security to most men There are only two means of escape from this unstable and intolerable system first the Collectivist State which through its efforts to establish state guaranteed sufficiency and security will really establish another form of the servile state and second a reaction towards a condition of welldivided property or the

advocates as Burke Hegel and Mill and more recently has been supported by certain wellknown French publicistsnotably Duguit Charles Benoist and Maxime Leroyand by sociologists from various countries including Gumplowicz Durkheim and Ratzenhofer The proponents of this idea argue that our present system of representation is based on the fallacious assumption that the common interests of citizens are their community interests that economic and social needs and opinions vary primarily as we pass from region to region and that therefore the just and logical plan of repre sentation is the territorial system They maintain that the present system is nonrepresentative and misrepresentative of the interests and views of the people A territorial region they hold is never identified with a particular interest or opinion each district is the habitation of groups of such various conflicting economic and social needs and views that no clear mandate for the supposed representative can be fused out of them so that what is really represented is simply one or few of the stronger among the numerous minority groupsproducers consumers farmers laborers employers employees landlords tenants The question of professional representation has been actively agitated in France during the last few decades and numerous schemes have been devised by various organizations some of which schemes have been embodied in bills introduced in Parlia ment The plan of representation proposed by the League of Professional Representation and Regionalist Action for the governing body of the new regions proposed by it provides for the division of voters in each region into five classesnamely agriculturists merchants manufacturers liberal professions and government employees28 28 For discussion of

Administrative syndicalism re lates to a new location of control within the departments which administer the various governmental services The administra tive structure of presentday governments is on the whole the result of adaptations to exigencies quite other than those created by the newer types of activity assumed by modern governments during the last century or so That structure is determined chiefly by the effort to make the action of government just or effective in performing its older typical functionsmilitary diplomatic judicial police Generally these governments have entirely overlooked any need to recognize the peculiar interests of the persons who actually create the services purveyed or con tributed by government to the community and have neglected to increase expertness and initiative in administration by enlarg ing the power and responsibility of such persons With the steadily expanding nationalization and municipalization of vari ous social and economic services governments have done little or nothing in the way of developing a new structure by which each group of public servants could exercise their proper part in the control of the respective services We do find scattered instances of a limited participation in administrative direction accorded to civil officials But in all such cases the powers of the boards created for such joint control are narrowly defined being generally restricted to matters of discipline and promotion and in all the civil servants have only a minority voice29 In the absence of provision within the governmental structure itself of opportunities for selfexpression and responsibility on the part of governmental employees it is naturalespecially in view of the enlarged opportunities of selfexpression which employees in private industry have acquiredthat during the last few decades public employees have in many instances created for themselves organs of collective expression We can not 29 For examples of

movement for the unionization of public servants except to mention that the movement has made rapid progress against persistent govern mental opposition that in Great Britain and France for example the national civil services are almost completely unionized and the local services extensively unionized that considerable prog ress has been made in the unionization of national and local services in many other countriesincluding the United States and that some headway has been made in forcing political and administrative heads to recognize and deal directly and officially with such unions30 The movement for unionization in the public service has doubtless been primarily an economic movement the chief objects of unionization being to secure better terms as to wages hours and other conditions of work But the desire of public employees for responsibility and selfexpression in their work has been a potent motive also Moreover administrative reformers have been glad to utilize the movement as a means of promoting their plans to increase expertness in administration by giving to civil servants definite shares in controlling or influ encing the policies of their respective departments During the latter half of the World War and since the war new projects some of them issuing from public sources have been devised for participation by public employees in the administration of their respective services and some of the projects have been in 3 Except for France we have only scattered and piecemeal accounts of the recent evolution of unionization in the civil service For England see

of the war department established joint advisory boards in several of the arsenals for questions of industrial administration In England we have the govern ments plan for applying the Whitley scheme of joint standing councils in the public service the official plan of the Sankey commission for miners participation in the administration of the coalmining industry with national ownership of the coal royal ties and the governments bill to establish a national representa tive council for the English police The application of the Whitley system to the public service in England involves the establishment in various departments of boards jointly repre sentative of the employees and the ministerial head but so far the government has been willing to concede only advisory powers to these boards The civil service organizations have demanded that the boards should have full executive powers and they have also demanded for the employees an equal though not a majority representation on the boards Some projects of administrative reform in France go so far as to urge that the working officials in the public service should be endowed with real responsibility through the power of initiative and administrative direction in the work of their respective departments and that they should be made administratively independent of governmental inter ference leaving to the ministerial heads only the power of keep ing the officials within the law Such is the object of the Ligue des gouverncs headed by Maxime Leroy and formed in 191931 The French government has in recent months put forth proposals for a greater recognition of and cooperation with the syndicates in the public service32 Guild Socialism None of the movements which we have just sketched makes any direct attack upon the ultimately indivisible legally absolute sovereignty of the state They are however properly considered in a study of political pluralism for in the first place they for the most part reflect the

doctrines finally such movements do actually tend towards a greater diversification of political and administrative control than we now have The purposes of most guild socialists go further look to a more fundamental division of social control and are more nearly in full harmony with the pluralists notion of a state brought down to the level of other social organizations The guildsocialist or national guilds movement is chiefly a British movement and may roughly be said to have been initiated about fifteen years ago its doctrines receiving their earliest systematic statement in the writings of A J Penty33 and A R Orage34 The propaganda has been carried on chiefly through the New Age now edited by Orage and S G Hobson and the numerous books and articles by the three writers just mentioned and G D H Cole R H Tawney and others6 The programs of guild socialism although economic programs yet require a fundamental reconstruction of political organi zation Guild socialism might be called pluralistic socialism Its aim is not to enlarge but rather to restrict the functions of the political state however democratized the state may be made to be It regards orthodox socialism and collectivism as simply newer forms of politicalism against which in all its forms guild socialists protest because it makes the state supreme above other social groupings The guild socialists do not regard state social 33 Penty The Restoration of the Guilds System London 1906 a4 Orage Politics for Craftsmen Contemporary Review Vol 91 1907 pp 782794 35 On the evolution of the movement in Great

given industry have no more part in the control of their industrial life than they would if working under private ownership because the administration of the industry under state socialism is still in the hands of officials whose bias and associations separate them from the actual workers In any given stateoperated industry under a collectivist system the workers are under the control of an electorate most of whom have no direct or vital interest in the questions peculiar to that industry The guild socialist denies that the state is the community or that it may properly exercise the greater part of the communitys power and he maintains that there are many forms of common action in which the state has no proper part The state as a territorial association is fit to deal with matters which affect all citizens equally and in the same way but it is not qualified by its struc ture or mode of action to deal with matters which affect different groups of citizens in different ways Guild socialists regard neither the territorial nor the professional grouping in society as by itself adequate Certain common requirements are best fulfilled by the former and certain others by the latter neither should be completely and universally sovereign36 The several groups of guild socialists are united on the one hand in the notion that the state must be deprived of control over production generally and on the other hand in the notion that the state must remainat least until some faroff future as an indispensable institution of society But in their more detailed description of the sphere of the stateparticularly in relation to industrial affairsthey differ in some essential points Perhaps the prevailing opinion as to state functions is that held by the group headed by G D H Cole With this group the ideal system is a system of democratically organized associations of workers controlling industry in cooperation with a democratized state They would have a national body representative of all the guildsa guild congress holding the same relation to the citizens as producers that the national political parliament occupies in 36 Cole SelfGovernment in Industry pp 8589206 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW relation to the citizens as consumers The effort is to harmonize the right of the consumer to control use and consumption with the right of the producer to control production The guild organization in order to satisfy the producers just demand for responsibility and selfgovernment must control conditions of production the state to satisfy the consumers just claim for an equitable division of the national produce and for full pro vision of the goods and services which he justly requires should own the means of production and regulate the price of products and the distribution of income In addition to these economic functions the state should according to this school continue to perform its purely political dutiesin defining and regulating noneconomic personal rela tions that is the control of marriage and divorce the protection and education of children the care of dependent and defective persons the prevention and punishment of crime37 But Cole and his followers argue that the division of social authority is not merely between the national guild and the state The individual should be allowed to distribute his loyalties and obligations among a number of functional bodies38 There are other functional associationsreligious for exampleof like importance Society should be pluralistically organized on a functional basisshould be divided into a number of co ordinate associations each dealing with some essential aspect of associated life But here the monistic evil reappears For it is acknowledged that it is impossible to make such an exact definition of the respective functions of the various associations as to remove all opportunities for rivalry and conflict of interest and competence There must therefore be a superior co6rdi nating authority to adjudicate such conflicts Such an authority can not be the state or any other one of the associations but must be a joint body representative of all the essential functional associations9 This federal body is to deal only with matters common to all the associations or affecting more than one asso 37Cole Social Theory pp 8687 100101 but compare page 137 38 Ibid

initiating body It must possess supreme powers of coercion maintaining ultimate control over the whole para phernalia of law and police40 Despite this reappearance of the monists overlord the goal of these reformers is still a pluralistic goal The organization just described by securing a logical and just distribution of individual rights and obligations would they hold promote a gradual reduction in the occasions for coercion and thus a gradual disappearance of the need for any supreme coercive authority Thus these guild socialists although denying sov ereignty to the state only to attribute it to a new social institu tion yet hold up as an ideal of the future the ultimate disap pearance of sovereign authority of any sort With other guild socialists typified by S G Hobson no dual organization of industrial control is considered necessary Con sumers interests can be adequately represented within the guild system The elimination of profits will remove profiteering and exploitation What conflicts may arise within the organi zation of producers crafts can be adjusted through a state stripped of power to command in domestic affairs but endowed with a spiritual leadership which will effectively harmonize these conflicts The states intervention in industrial affairs should be exceptional and determined not by any supposed special consumers interests but only by considerations of general public interest In the interpretation of public policy the state is apparently to be the ultimately final authority Whether it is to be entitled to use force as well as spiritual methods as a means of intervention in the public interest is not clear In fact no guild socialist has made clear to the present writer at least any clear discrimination between political and other func tions and methods Cole in a way recognizes this failure by providing for a joint sovereign to supply this necessary dis crimination Hobsons plan suggests but does not fully explain an ultimately divided social organization 40 Cole Social Theory p 137208 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW The earlier efforts of the leading guild socialists were directed to the intellectual classes Their propaganda has recently taken a more practical direction The National Guilds League was formed in 1915 and a propaganda initiated among trade unionists Mr Frank H Hodges secretary of the Miners Federation is a national guildsman the mines nationalization bill drafted recently by the federation was built upon the principles of guild socialism as are also recent projects prepared by the National Union of Railwaymen the Railway Clerks Association the National Union of Teachers and various post office trade unions Syndicalism Syndicalism like guild socialism represents a reaction from the politicalism of socialism and other systems which subordinate economic organization to political authority Elements of the syndicalist theory have existed since the begin ning of the socialist movement In its recent and present form it is slightly earlier in origin than the recent movement of guild socialism Syndicalism received its earliest development in France where also it has attained its widest development41 Its philosophic exposition is found chiefly in the writings of men not closely related to the practical syndicalist efforts notably in the writings of Georges Sorel Eduard Berth and Hubert Lagardelle42 As compared with guild socialism syndicalism represents a substantial step further in the direction of pluralism in social authority43 The syndicalists would eliminate from society not only the capitalists but the state also They regard as inade 41 On the history of the syndicalist movement in France see Levine The Labor Movement in France A Study in Revolutionary

terri torial representation They regard the state as inevitably an instrument in the hands of the possessing classes used by them to dominate and exploit the workers They represent guild socialism as a system designed to protect not the working proletariat but the bourgeoisie from domination by the state and by property owners The syndicalist system provides for actually and completely selfdetermining industrial and pro fessional groups each absolutely free from any organized control It is a clear and frank application of the pluralistic hypothesis The most important organization in which syndicalist ideas prevail is the Confederation Generrale du Travail This body adopted syndicalist doctrines soon after its foundation in 1895 Various events during the past two years have revealed some difference and uncertainty of opinion within the organization as to whether violent or pacific methods should be used to pro mote the practical realization of their ideals as to the extent to which political reforms are proper objects for their present efforts and as to the practical utility of the strike for political ends Their recent program of proposed legislation for the control of industry is accompanied by propaganda whose terms in certain parts as to joint control for example may be intended to obscure the real significance of their program But the details of the program are clear for in each of the proposed joint boards the representatives of the workers outnumber the representa tives of the public so that the syndicalist ideal of economic federalism and workers control would be realized by the adop tion of the program4 Counterparts of the French general federation of labor are found in weaker organizations in England America and other countries in England for example in the Industrial Syndicalist League founded in 1920 under the leader ship of Tom Mann in the United States chiefly in the Industrial Workers of the World which founded in Chicago in 1905 inherited aims of the Knights of Labor organized in 1869 and 44 See Allix  Syndicalisme et Nationalisation Revue Politique et Parlemen taire July 1920 pp 117129210 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW merged several earlier organizations founded on an industrial as distinguished from a craft basis45 The organizations outside of France have generally developed neither numerically strong membership nor notably able leadership46 It is not within the scope of this article to discuss the extent to which any of the various projects sketched here are worthy of consideration as schemes to be put into operation in our politi cal system although it would obviously be worth while for political scientists to consider the movements in that aspect Our interest here has been primarily in their relation to pluralistic theories of state sovereignty with respect to which the following brief suggestions may be offered by way of summary 45 Among the numerous accounts of the history and policies of the I W WI the following may be cited as among the more useful accounts Paul F Brissen den The Launching of the Industrial Workers of the World Berkely 1913 Univer sity of

46 Joint Control in Private Industry Another practical movement which is in part decentralizing in tendency and which involves a recognition of group inter ests is the movement for joint control or workers participation in control in private industry The movement may be regarded as a practical application of principles similar to those of the sociologists referred to above There are a great many illustrations in the field both of practice and of proposals and there are many familiar recent examples of a recognition by the state of the need for deal ing with industrial problems through agencies representative of the organized groups immediately concerned The working of some systems of compulsory arbitration is largely dependent as in New Zealand and New South Wales upon action of workers and employers in their respective organizations And in England the Whitley system of joint standing industrial councils in each industry to settle by periodic negotiation a wide range of questions in that industry aff ords another example The experiences of a number of these Whitley councils during the last two years proves them competent to deal intelligently with a variety of in dustrial questions and to reach conclusions acceptable to both sides and practically applicable Similar schemes have been instituted in other European countries and the tentative and partial steps in the same line in this country are familiar There is a copious current literature on this general movement See especially Sidney and Beatrice Webb A Constitution for the Socialist Commonwealth of Great Britain London 1920 and Arthur Gleason The New Constitutionalism in British Industry Survey Vol 41 1919 pp 594598TECHNIQUE OF THE PLURALISTIC STATE 211 A fundamentally pluralistic theory of state sovereignty seems neither necessary nor appropriate for any of the proposals referred to except those of syndicalism and its closely kindred doctrines The syndicalist programs can rest upon the syndical ist philosophy of Sorel and Lagardelle other projects upon the historical and analytical expositions of Gierke Maitland Figgis Hauriou Follet and sociologists such as Durkheim the views of none of these latter require any abandonment of the essential features of the conventional theory of state sovereignty All that the monistic doctrine of sovereignty implies is first that normally within any given independent community there is and can well be only one system of institutions for the enactment and enforce ment of civil lawsthat is commands which can be executed through the instrumentality of force in the form of coercion directed against the body or property or individuals physical distraint of the individuals goods or person or the taking of the life of the individual second that the usual and appropriate name for the organization comprehending these institutions is the state third that within such organization there is a legal sovereignthat is an organ or group of legally cooperating organs possessing ultimate legal control over other organs of the state and through these over individuals and the non political groups of the community and not itself subject to legal control fourth that the state has practical and moral utility as an agency of unification and coordination among the manifold cooperative groups in society  in exercising its peculiar function of adjusting the relations of such groups to one another No paramount moral importance is claimed for this organiza tion no claim is made that the state in its choice of activities to be brought under the sway of civil law can ignore social opinion or individual conscience or that the state should be considered competent to range over the whole area of human life or to absorb the whole loyalty of an individual47 or that the state is under no moral obligation to regard the purposes of other essential associations In some cases it may be morally right for an individual to obey commands which his conscience dis 47 Laski Authority in the Modern State pp 45 83212 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW approves in other cases it may not be whatever the author of the commandstate church or trade union Most monists perhaps believe that in states which endure and follow the general progress of civilization the occasions for conflict between political and individual conscience tend to become relatively fewer that such states are constantly readjusting their policies in order to remove discord between law and conscience that the prevailing trend of political development is possibly in the general direction of a greater humanization of state policy Such are about the only moral claims that an ordinary monist makes for the state His political ethics on its positive constructive side should probably go further and demand that where conflicts arise between the command of the state and that of other groups the citizen should not consider himself to have fulfilled his duty by deciding which command it is right to obey in that instance but that he should use his effort to change the policy manifested in the wrong command of the one so as to make it accord with the right policy of the other We should recognize the practical utility of consistent legal and political theory So it seems a matter of practical impor tance that the fundamental constitutional implications of none of the interesting projects we have named should be misrepre sented by loose or inexact theory A movement to reinvigorate local institutions by enlarging their functions and increasing their administrative autonomy proposals that recognize that government because it is no longer a mere protectionaffording evilsuppressing authority but also a giant serving producing and purveying corporation supplying various economic cultural and social needs must therefore in its nonpolice activities divest itself somewhat of its iron disciplinarianism and wooden officialism the notion that greater recognition must be given to interest groups both within and without government and that a new organization of representation may be necessary in order to represent a larger number of

which gives basis to a notion that their adoption would mean any great disturbance of our idea that in any inde pendent society there is a single organization of final legal con trol or any theory which may give rise to a fear that the pro posals are anarchistic in logical or practical tendency does in that respect in theory and therefore in practice a disservice to the proposals Although this is the conclusion which the writer has to offer on the question of the relations of the pluralistic doctrines of Laski and Duguit to the practical movements which they claim as applications of their doctrines yet it would be improper for him to close with such a presumptuous criticism of the two important authors in question They have rendered a valuable service in fostering interest in the writings of other authors such as those we have named above and in the practical move ments which appear to have a clearer theoretical basis in the works of those other authors In general the brilliant and interesting writings of Duguit and Laski have undoubtedly been of value in inducing us to think less about questions of sovereignty and more about questions of representation and government

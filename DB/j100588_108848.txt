J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,108848,ON THE NATURE OF THE FORCES CONCERNED IN PRODUCING THE GREATER MAGNETIC DISTURBANCES,I207017, 621  XXVIII ON THE NATURE OF THE FORCES CONCERNED IN PRODUCING THE GREATER MAGNETIC DISTURBANCES BY BALFOUR STEWART MA FRS RECEIVED JUNE 14READ JUNE 19 1862 1 IN A PREVIOUS COMMUNICATION SUBMITTED TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY ON JUNE 28TH 1861 AND SINCE PUBLISHED IN THEIR TRANSACTIONS I VENTURED TO MAKE A SUGGESTION REGARDING THE NATURE OF THAT CONNEXION WHICH SUBSISTS BETWEEN MAGNETIC DISTURBANCES EARTH CURRENTS AND AURORAS IN THIS HYPOTHESIS THE EARTH WAS VIEWED AS SIMILAR TO THE SOFT IRON CORE OF A RUHM KORFFS MACHINE IN WHICH A PRIMARY DISTURBING CURRENT WAS SUPPOSED TO INDUCE MAG NETISM EARTHCURRENTS AND AURORAS ON THE OTHER HAND WERE VIEWED AS INDUCED OR SECONDARY CURRENTS CAUSED BY THE SMALL BUT ABRUPT CHANGES WHICH ARE CONSTANTLY TAKING PLACE IN THE STRENGTH OF THE PRIMARY DISTURBING CURRENT THESE CHANGES BEING VERY MUCH HEIGHTENED IN EFFECT BY THE ACTION OF THE IRON CORE THAT IS TO SAY OF THE EARTH 2 THESE SMALL AND RAPID CHANGES ARE VERY OBSERVABLE IN THE PHOTOGRAPHIC TRACES GIVEN BY THE KEW MAGNETOGRAPHS DURING A TIME OF DISTURBANCE AT SUCH A TIME THE CURVES FOR ALL THE THREE ELEMENTS INVARIABLY PRESENT A SERRATED APPEARANCE WHICH WHEN THE DISTURBING CAUSE IS VERY POWERFUL IS MAGNIFIED INTO A SUCCESSION OF SHARP PEAKS AND HOLLOWS AND THESE EXHIBIT A FREQUENCY OF CHANGE WHICH MAKES THEM COMPARABLE IN THIS RESPECT WITH EARTHCURRENTS AND AURORAS THESE PEAKS AND HOLLOWS ARE THEREFORE REGARDED BY THIS HYPOTHESIS AS DENOTING THE CHANGES WHICH TAKE PLACE IN THE ACTION OF THE PRIMARY DISTURBING CURRENT UPON THE NEEDLE THROUGH THE INTERVENTION OF THE EARTHS MAGNETISM OR SINCE THE EXISTENCE OF A PRIMARY CURRENT IS REALLY UNNECESSARY AS AN EXPLANATION WE MAY DISPENSE WITH IT ALTOGETHER  AND REGARD THESE PHOTOGRAPHIC PEAKS AND HOLLOWS AS SIMPLY REPRESENTING THE CHANGES WHICH TAKE PLACE IN THE MAGNETISM OF THE EARTH WITHOUT SPECULATING UPON THE CAUSE OF SUCH CHANGES 3 IN THE PAPER ALREADY ALLUDED TO IN DISCUSSING THE GREAT MAGNETIC STORM EXTENDING FROM AUGUST 28 TO SEPTEMBER 7 1859 I ENDEAVOURED TO SHOW THAT THE FIRST EFFECT OF THE SUPERIMPOSED DISTURBING FORCE WAS TO DIMINISH BOTH ELEMENTS OF THE EARTHS MAGNETISM DURING A PERIOD OF ABOUT SIX HOURS THIS GRAND WAVE CONSTITUTING THE GREAT BODY OF FORCE COULD NOT I REMARKED BE SUPPOSED TO BE DUE TO ANY COMBINATION OF EARTHCURRENTS OF WHICH THE PERIOD IS ONLY A FEW MINUTES UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IT WOULD SEEM TO BE THE MOST NATURAL SUPPOSITION TO REGARD THE PEAKS AND HOLLOWS WHICH OCCUR AS IT WERE ON THE SURFACE OF THE GREAT DISTURBANCE WAVE AS REPRESENTING RAPID CHANGES IN THE IN  THIS WAS SUGGESTED TO ME BY PROFESSOR TYDALL6MR B STEWART ON THE NATURE OF THE FORCES TENSITY OF THE DISTURBING FORCE AND THEREFORE NOT AS PHENOMENA CAUSED BY EARTHCURRENTS SINCE THE GREAT BODY OF THE DISTURBANCE OF WHICH THEY REPRESENT THE CHANGES CANNOT BE DUE TO ANY SUCH CAUSE AURORAS AND EARTHCURRENTS BEING THUS REMOVED OUT OF THE LIST OF CAUSES MIGHT THEN BE SUPPOSED TO FOLLOW RATHER AS EFFECTS OF THESE MAGNETIC CHANGES ON THE PRINCIPLE OF VOLTAIC INDUCTION ALREADY MENTIONED AS HOWEVER THERE SEEMS TO BE A TENDENCY TO REGARD THE MOTIONS OF THE MAGNETIC NEEDLE AS DUE TO THE DIRECT ACTION OF EARTHCURRENTS IT MAY BE DESIRABLE HERE TO INQUIRE WHETHER THIS VIEW OF THE ORIGIN OF THESE SMALL AND RAPID DISTURBANCES IS CAPABLE OF BEING ACCEPTED AS A TENABLE HYPOTHESIS 4 IT IS ALMOST UNNECESSARY TO REMARK THAT THE HYPOTHESIS WHICH ASSERTS THAT EARTH CURRENTS ARE NOT THE CAUSE OF THE SMALL AND RAPID MAGNETIC DISTURBANCES DOES NOT ASSERT THAT SUCH CURRENTS HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO INFLUENCE UPON THE NEEDLE SINCE WE KNOW THAT A CURRENT MUST ALWAYS ACT UPON A NEEDLE BUT IT MAINTAINS THAT THESE CURRENTS ARE INDUCED AND SECONDARY PHENOMENA AND THEREFORE REPRESENT ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF THE WHOLE FORCE IN OPERATION AND REACT ON THE MAGNET ONLY TO A VERY LIMITED EXTENT 5 THE INTERESTING OBSERVATIONS ON EARTHCURRENTS MADE UNDER THE DIRECTION OF MR C V WALKER AND RECORDED BY HIM IN A PAPER RECENTLY PUBLISHED IN THE TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY APPEAR TO FURNISH GROUNDS FOR AN HYPOTHESIS REGARDING THESE PHENOMENA BY REFERENCE TO A MAP APPENDED TO HIS PAPER IT APPEARS THAT A LINE DRAWN FROM THE RAMSGATE TO THE MARGATE TELEGRAPH STATION PROCEEDS IN A DIRECTION 120 50 W OF TRUE NORTH OR ASSUMING 21 30 W AS THE APPROXIMATE MAGNETIC DECLINATION THIS LINE PROCEEDS IN A DIRECTION 8 40 E OF MAGNETIC NORTH IN LIKE MANNER A LINE DRAWN FROM THE ASHFORD TO THE RAMSGATE TELEGRAPH STATION PROCEEDS IN A DIRECTION 833 50 E OF MAGNETIC NORTH ALSO A LINE DRAWN FROM THE ASHFORD TO THE MARGATE STATION IN A DIRECTION 77 42 E OF MAGNETIC NORTH BY MR WALKERS OBSERVATIONS FROM AUGUST 29 TO SEPTEMBER 2 1859 AND ALSO FROM AUGUST 8 TO AUGUST 10 1860 IT WOULD APPEAR THAT A CURRENT PROCEEDING FROM MARGATE TO RAMSGATE WAS ALWAYS SIMULTANEOUS WITH ONE PROCEEDING FROM RAMSGATE TO ASHFORD AND WITH ONE PROCEEDING FROM MARGATE TO ASHFORD THAT IS TO SAY SIMULTANEOUS CURRENTS PROCEEDING ALONG THESE LINES WERE EITHER ALL NORTH OR ALL SOUTH CURRENTS LET US ENDEAVOUR TO ASCERTAIN HOW FAR THIS AGREES WITH THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE MAGNETO GRAPHS AT KEW DURING THESE TWO DISTURBANCES ON THE HYPOTHESIS OF DIRECT ACTION ASSUMING ALSO WITH MR WALKER THAT EARTHCURRENTS ARE DERIVED FROM A STREAM OF ELECTRICITY WHICH IS DRIFTING ACROSS THE COUNTRY CONCEIVE NOW A CURRENT RESOLVED INTO TWO COMPONENTS THE ONE PROCEEDING IN THE MAG NETIC MERIDIAN AND THE OTHER IN A DIRECTION PERPENDICULAR TO IT AND LET US AGREE TO CON SIDER AS POSITIVE THOSE CURRENTS FLOWING FROM MAGNETIC NORTH TO SOUTH AND FROM MAGNETIC EAST TO WEST OF THESE TWO COMPONENTS THE FIRST ONLY WILL AFFECT THE FREELY SUSPENDED DECLINATION MAGNET A POSITIVE CURRENT TENDING TO INCREASE THE WESTERLY DECLINATION WHILE THE LATTER ONLY WILL AFFECT THE HORIZONTALFORCE MAGNET WHICH HAS BEEN TWISTED INTO A POSITION AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN A POSITIVE CURRENT INCREASING THE HORIZONTAL FORCE 622CONCERNED IN PRODUCING THE GREATER MAGNETIC DISTURBANCES 623 LET X BE THE VALUE OF THE NORTH AND SOUTH AND Y THAT OF THE EAST AND WEST COMPONENT OF A CURRENT AS DEDUCED FROM ITS EFFECTS UPON THE MAGNETOGRAPHS THIS WILL GIVE ON THE MARGATE AND RAMSGATE LINE A CURRENT REPRESENTED BY AX COS 840YSIN 8 40    1 WHILE FOR THE RAMSGATE AND ASHFORD LINE WE SHALL HAVE B X COS 830 50Y SIN 83 50  2 AND FOR THE MARGATE AND ASHFORD LINE CX COS 77 42Y SIN 77 42   3 WHERE A B C ARE POSITIVE CONSTANTS DEPENDING UPON THE NATURE OF THE SOIL AND STRATA ALONG THE VARIOUS LINES NOW IN THE DISTURBANCE OF 8TH TO 10TH AUGUST 1860 THE DECLINATION AND HORIZONTAL FORCE WERE INCREASED SIMULTANEOUSLY OR THEY WERE DIMINISHED SIMULTANEOUSLY HENCE X AND Y HAVE THE SAME SIGN AND THE EXPRESSIONS WITHIN BRACKETS ARE EITHER ALL POSITIVE OR ALL NEGATIVE THAT IS TO SAY THE CURRENTS BETWEEN THESE LINES SHOULD HAVE BEEN EITHER ALL NORTH OR ALL SOUTH SIMULTANEOUSLY THIS WAS OBSERVED TO BE THE CASE IN THIS INSTANCE THEREFORE THERE IS NOTHING TO CONTRADICT THE HYPOTHESIS WHICH MAKES EARTHCURRENTS THE CAUSE OF MAGNETIC DISTURBANCES LET US NOW EXAMINE THE DISTURBANCE OF AUGUST 29 TO SEPTEMBER 2 1859 HERE THE HORIZONTAL FORCE WAS INCREASED WHEN THE DECLINATION WAS DIMINISHED AND VICE VERSD AND IF WE REPRESENT BY UNITY THE CURRENT INFLUENTIAL IN DISTURBING THE FORMER ELEMENT THAT DISTURBING THE LATTER IS MOST PROBABLY REPRESENTED BY  46 SEE TABLE V HENCE 1 2 3 BECOME 1A46COS

BETWEEN MARGATE AND RAMSGATE WHILE CURRENTS OF THE OPPOSITE NAME TRAVERSED THE OTHER TWO LINES BUT THIS IS NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE OBSERVATIONS MADE WHICH SHOWED THAT CURRENTS OF THE SAME NAME TRAVERSED THE THREE LINES SIMULTANEOUSLY IN ONE WORD THE PROOF AGAINST THE THEORY OF THE DIRECT ACTION OF EARTHCURRENTS IN CAUSING DISTURBANCES MAY BE SUMMED UP BY SAYING THAT WHILE THE MAGNETIC DISTURBANCES OF SEPTEMBER 1859 AND AUGUST 1860 WERE OF OPPOSITE CHARACTER THE CORRESPONDING EARTHCURRENTS AS DETERMINED BY THESE THREE TELEGRAPHIC LINES WERE OF THE SAME CHARACTER 6 AT FIRST VIEW IT WOULD ALMOST APPEAR AS IF THIS FACT WHICH SEEMS CONCLUSIVE AGAINST EARTHCURRENTS AT LEAST THOSE EARTHCURRENTS OBSERVED IN THIS COUNTRY BEING THE DIRECT AND MAIN CAUSE OF DISTURBANCES WERE EQUALLY CONCLUSIVE AGAINST THEIR BEING INDUCED CURRENTS SINCE THE EFFECT OF SUCH UPON THE TELEGRAPH NEEDLE MIGHT BE SUPPOSED OPPOSITE IN CHARACTER TO THAT WHICH WOULD BE PRODUCED BY SUCH CURRENTS AS WOULD DIRECTLY CAUSE MAGNETIC DISTURBANCES THE TWO EFFECTS BEING ANTITHETICALLY AND THEREFORE DEFINITELY RELATED TO EACH OTHER MDCCCLXII 4 QMR B STEWART ON THE NATTRE OF THE FORCES BUT THIS DIFFICULTY WILL DISAPPEAR WHEN WE REFLECT THAT EARTHCURRENTS MAY BE TWISTED IN PASSING OVER THE SURFACE OF OUR GLOBE ALTHOUGH THEREFORE WE MAY NOT FIND THAT OPPOSITENESS OF CHARACTER WHICH WE NATURALLY ASSOCIATE WITH INDUCED CURRENTS YET THE STUDY OF PARTICULAR EARTHCURRENTS IN CONNEXION WITH SIMULTANEOUS MAGNETIC DISTURBANCES MAY PERHAPS SERVE TO THROW SOME LIGHT UPON THE NATURE OF THE FORMER 7 THE FOLLOWING IS BROUGHT FORWARD AS AN INSTANCE OF THIS ON SEPTEMBER 1ST 1120 AM G M T A STRONG SOUTHERLY CURRENT WAS NOTICED ON THE ASHFORD AND MARGATE LINE WHICH LASTED TILL 1126 AM WHILE FROM 1128 AM TO 1135 AM A SLIGHT NORTHERLY CURRENT WAS OBSERVED ON THE SAME LINE IF WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT A SLIGHT DELAY IN THE STARTING OF THE KEW CURVES EQUAL TO ABOUT 2 MINUTES DUE TO THE SLACKNESS OF THE TOOTHED WHEELS WHICH DRIVE THE CYLINDERS WE FIND THE FIRST RECORDED APPEARANCE OF THE SOUTH CURRENT TO BE IN POINT OF TIME 1 1MINUTE BEHIND THAT OF A VERY ABRUPT DISTURBANCE WHICH AFFECTED ALL THE MAGNETIC ELEMENTS AT KEW AND WHICH OCCURRED SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE OUTBREAK OF A CURIOUS PHENOMENON ON THE SUNS DISK WHATEVER BE THE CAUSE OF THIS APPARENT DIFFERENCE IN TIME I DO NOT THINK THAT IT ARGUES ANY WANT OF SIMULTANEITY BETWEEN THE MAGNETIC DIS TURBANCE AND THE EARTHCURRENT AND WE MAY SAFELY SUPPOSE THAT THE FIRST OUTBREAK OF THE SOUTH CURRENT WAS REALLY SIMULTANEOUS WITH THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE DISTURBANCE AT KEW THE MAGNETS AT KEW WERE AFFECTED IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER THE WESTERLY DECLINATION WAS AT FIRST RAPIDLY INCREASED BUT SOON THE DISTURBING FORCE ATTAINED ITS MAXIMUM AND THEN GRADUALLY DIMINISHED UNTIL ULTIMATELY THE NEEDLE ATTAINED NEARLY THE SAME POSITION WHICH IT HAD BEFORE THE DISTURBANCE THE HORIZONTAL FORCE WAS AT FIRST RAPIDLY DIMINISHED THEN AS THE DISTURBING FORCE DIED AWAY IT ALSO GRADUALLY CAME BACK TO ITS PREVIOUS VALUE A DIRECT CURRENT WHICH WOULD CAUSE A DISTURBANCE OF THIS NATURE WOULD BE ONE AT FIRST RAPIDLY INCREASING THEN GRADUALLY DIMINISHING BUT ALWAYS PRESERVING THE SAME NAME WHEREAS THE INDUCED EFFECT OF SUCH A DISTURBANCE WOULD BE AT FIRST A STRONG CURRENT IN ONE DIRECTION AND AFTERWARDS A WEAK CURRENT IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION THE LATTER CHARACTER AGREES VERY WELL WITH THAT OF THE CURRENTS BETWEEN ASHFORD AND MARGATE THE FORMER CHARACTER NOT IN THE LEAST JUDGING THEREFORE FROM THIS DISTURBANCE AND THOUGH ONLY A SINGLE EXAMPLE IT APPEARS TO BE AN UNEXCEPTIONABLE ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT EARTHCURRENTS DO NOT CAUSE MAGNETIC DISTURBANCES BUT ARE RATHER THE INDUCED CURRENTS WHICH THE LATTER GIVE RISE TO 8 I SHALL NOW ENDEAVOUR TO SHOW THAT WE HAVE GROUNDS FOR SUPPOSING THE MAGNETO GRAPH PEAKS AND HOLLOWS TO BE DUE TO CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE DISTURBING FORCE THE ACTION OF ANY SUCH DISTURBING FORCE IS OF A TWOFOLD NATURE 1 IT RAISES A CURVE ABOVE ITS NORMAL POSITION OR DEPRESSES IT BELOW THE SAME VISIBLY AND FOR A SOMEWHAT LENGTHENED PERIOD OF TIME 2 THE CURVE WHICH REPRESENTS THIS DEFINITE ACTION OF THE FORCE IS AT THE SAME TIME STUDDED WITH SHARP PEAKS AND HOLLOWS NOW IF THE SECOND OF THESE TWO EFFECTS DENOTES THE CHANGES WHICH OCCUR IN THE FORCE 624CONCERNED IN PRODUCING THE GREATER MAGNETIC DISTURBANCES 625 PRODUCING THE FIRST THE PEAKS AND HOLLOWS SHOULD BE SIMILAR IN CHARACTER TO THE GENERAL EFFECTS OF THE FORCE THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLE WILL EXPLAIN WHAT IS MEANT IF WE HAVE A FORCE WHICH SIMULTANEOUSLY AND FOR A LENGTHENED PERIOD OF TIME RAISES UP THE CURVES OF ALL THE THREE ELEMENTS NEARER TO THE TOP OF THE PAPER AND IF THE PEAKS AND HOLLOWS DENOTE CHANGES TAKING PLACE IN THE INTENSITY OF THIS FORCE THEN ALL THE THREE ELEMENTS SHOULD EXHIBIT PEAKS AT ONCE OR HOLLOWS AT ONCE BUT IF ON THE OTHER HAND THE GENERAL APPEARANCE OF THE CURVES REPRESENTS THE DECLINATION AS RAISED UP WHILE BOTH THE OTHER ELEMENTS ARE DEPRESSED THEN A PEAK IN THE FORMER SHOULD CORRESPOND TO A HOLLOW IN THE LATTER TWO 9 I REQUESTED MR CHAMBERS MAGNETICAL ASSISTANT AT KEW TO NOTE HIS IMPRESSION OF THE GENERAL APPEARANCE OF THE DISTURBANCE CURVES OF MOST IMPORTANCE FOR THE YEARS 1858 1859 AND 1860 AND THE FOLLOWING TABLE IS THE RESULT THE SIGNMEANS THAT THE CURVE IS RAISED TOWARDS THE TOP OF THE PAPER THE

HORIZONTAL FORCE AND ONLY SEVEN CASES OF AN OPPOSITE DESCRIPTION ALSO THERE ARE TWENTYTWO CASES IN WHICH THE DECLINATION IS RAISED OR LOWERED ALONG WITH THE VERTICAL FORCE AND ONLY ELEVEN CASES OF AN OPPOSITE DESCRIPTION FINALLY THERE ARE THIRTYONE CASES IN WHICH BOTH FORCES ARE RAISED OR LOWERED TOGETHER AND ONLY TWO CASES OF AN OPPOSITE DESCRIPTION THERE IS THEREFORE A DECIDED TENDENCY IN THE CURVES OF ALL THE ELEMENTS TO BE RAISED OR LOWERED SIMULTANEOUSLY BUT THIS TENDENCY IS STRONGER BETWEEN THE HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL FORCE CURVES THAN BETWEEN EITHER OF THESE AND THE DECLINATION IT MAY AT THE SAME TIME BE AFFIRMED THAT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE DISTURBANCE OF AUGUSTSEPTEMBER 1859 THERE IS NO VERY PROMINENT CASE IN WHICH THE THREE ELEMENTS DO NOT RISE OR FALL TOGETHER 10 HAVING THUS RECORDED THE GENERAL APPEARANCE OF THE CURVES I SHALL NOW GIVE THE RESULT OF THE EXAMINATION OF THE SIMULTANEOUS PEAKS AND HOLLOWS BUT IT WILL FIRST BE NECESSARY TO STATE THE METHOD IN WHICH THIS HAS BEEN CONDUCTED EACH CURVE HAS A ZEROLINE OR LINE OF ABSCISSAE ALONG WHICH THE TIMES ARE RECKONED SO THAT IF WE WISH TO FIND THE TIME CORRESPONDING TO ANY POINT IN THE CURVE WE HAVE MERELY TO MEASURE ITS ABSCISSA THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE ZEROLINE DENOTING THE MOMENT AT WHICH THE INSTRUMENT WAS STARTED BEING THE ORIGIN IN LIKE MANNER IT IS EQUALLY EASY TO FIND THE POINT OF THE CURVE CORRESPONDING TO ANY GIVEN TIME THE ACCURACY OF THIS PROCESS DEPENDS HOWEVER IT WILL BE SEEN ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE TIMESCALE IS CONSTANT FOR THE DIFFERENT PORTIONS OF A CURVE AND THE FOLLOWING IS A PROOF THAT THIS IS STRICTLY TRUE IT WILL BE NOTICED SHORTLY THAT THIS SYSTEM OF MEASUREMENT HAS BROUGHT OUT A REMARK ABLE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE PEAKS AND HOLLOWS OF THE HORIZONTAL FORCE AND THOSE OF THE VERTICAL FORCE WHICH MAY BE SAID TO HAVE FAILED IN NO ONE INSTANCE THIS MAY BE RECEIVED AS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE NOT ONLY OF THE PHYSICAL FACT BROUGHT TO LIGHT BUT ALSO OF THE CONSTANCY OF THE TIMESCALE IN ABSENCE OF WHICH NO SUCH PHENOMENON COULD HAVE BEEN OBSERVED 11 THE FOLLOWING TABLE EXHIBITS THE RESULTS DERIVED FROM COMPARING TOGETHER THE PEAKS AND HOLLOWS OF THE DECLINATION WITH THOSE OCCURRING AT THE SAME INSTANT OF TIME IN THE HORIZONTAL FORCE WHEN PEAK AND PEAK OCCUR TOGETHER OR HOLLOW AND HOLLOW THIS IS TERMED A CORRE SPONDENCE THE REVERSE A NONCORRESPONDENCE 626CONCERNED IN

THE DECLI NATION CORRESPONDS TO A PEAK IN THE HORIZONTAL FORCE AND A HOLLOW IN THE ONE TO A HOLLOW IN THE OTHER IT IS PROPER TO MENTION THAT THE PEAKS AND HOLLOWS HERE OBSERVED ARE THOSE WHICH REPRESENT SUDDEN CHANGES OF SHORT DURATION FOR IF WE TAKE FOR COMPARISON SOME PROMINENT PEAK OR HOLLOW IN THE ONE CURVE HAVING A LONG PERIOD WE SHALL BE MUCH LESS CERTAIN OF FINDING A CORRESPONDING PHENOMENON IN THE OTHER 12 WHEN THE PEAKS AND HOLLOWS OF THE HORIZONTAL FORCE AND THOSE OF THE VERTICAL FORCE ARE COMPARED TOGETHER THE RESULT IS THAT A PEAK INVARIABLY CORRESPONDS TO A PEAK AND A HOLLOW TO A HOLLOW AND EVEN WHEN LARGE PROMINENCES OF LONG DURATION ARE TAKEN THE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE TWO CURVES IS VERY REMARKABLE THE SAME CONNEXION THEREFORE WHICH SUBSISTS BETWEEN THE SUDDEN MOVEMENTS OF THE DECLINATION AND THOSE OF THE HORIZONTAL FORCE HOLDS STILL MORE STRIKINGLY BETWEEN THOSE OF THE TWO FORCES 13 THE DISTURBANCE OF AUGUSTSEPTEMBER 1859 HAS BEEN PURPOSELY LEFT OUT

DISCUSSING THE RESULTS IN THIS TABLE I OUGHT TO MENTION THAT IN THIS GREAT DISTURBANCE THE RAPID NATURE OF THE MOTION MAKES THE COMPARISON OF SIMULTANEOUS PEAKS AND HOLLOWS A MATTER OF SOME LITTLE UNCERTAINTY ON THE OTHER HAND THESE COMPARISONS HAVE BEEN MUCH FACILITATED BY THE EXCEEDINGLY GOOD DEFINITION WHICH THE LABOURS OF THE LATE MR WELSH SECURED FOR THE KEW CURVES WITHOUT WHICH INDEED AN INVESTIGATION OF THIS NATURE WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE ON THE WHOLE I AM WELL PERSUADED THAT THE RESULTS IN TABLE III REPRESENT THE TRUTH 15 TO RECAPITULATE IT APPEARS FROM TABLE I THAT STUDYING MERELY THE GENERAL RESULT OF A DISTURBANCE THERE IS A DECIDED TENDENCY TO RAISE OR LOWER THE CURVES OF ALL THE ELEMENTS SIMULTANEOUSLY THIS BEING STRONGER BETWEEN THE HORIZONTAL AND THE VERTICALFORCE CURVES THAN BETWEEN EITHER OF THESE AND THE DECLINATION FROM TABLE II IT APPEARS THAT IF WE LEAVE OUT OF ACCOUNT THE GREAT DISTURBANCE OF AUGUSTSEPTEMBER 1859 A PEAK OF DECLINATION CORRESPONDS TO A PEAK OF HORIZONTAL FORCE AND A HOLLOW OF THE ONE TO A HOLLOW OF THE OTHER WHILE THE SAME CORRESPONDENCE HOLDS STILL MORE STRONGLY BETWEEN THE HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL FORCES AGAIN FROM TABLE III IT APPEARS THAT THE GREAT DISTURBANCE OF AUGUSTSEPTEMBER 1859 MAY BE BROKEN UP INTO TWO IN ONE OF THESE THE GENERAL RESULT WAS TO LOWER THE DECLINATION AND RAISE BOTH ELEMENTS OF THE FORCE WHILE IN THE SECOND THE RESULT WAS TO RAISE OR LOWER ALL THE THREE CURVES SIMULTANEOUSLY IT ALSO APPEARS THAT WHILE THE FIRST OF THESE DISTURBANCES PREVAILED A DECLINATION HOLLOW CORRESPONDED TO A PEAK OF EITHER FORCE AND THAT ON THE OTHER HAND WHILE THE SECOND PREVAILED A DECLINATION HOLLOW CORRE SPONDED TO A HOLLOW OF EITHER FORCE THIS VERY MARKED CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE PEAKS AND HOLLOWS AND THAT OF THE GENERAL DISTURBING FORCE IN ALL CASES LEAVES I THINK LITTLE DOUBT THAT THE FORMER REPRESENT SHARP AND SUDDEN CHANGES IN THE INTENSITY OF THE LATTER 628CONCERNED IN PRODUCING THE GREATER MAGNETIC DISTURBANCES 629 16 LET US NOW ENDEAVOUR TO ASCERTAIN IF ANY USE MAY BE MADE OF THIS FACT TO THROW LIGHT ON THE NATURE OF THE FORCES CONCERNED IN PRODUCING DISTURBANCES 17 TWO DISTINCT SUPPOSITIONS MAY BE MADE REGARDING THE NATURE AND MODE OF ACTION OF DISTURBING FORCES 1 WE MAY SUPPOSE THAT FORCES OF EVERY IMAGINABLE VARIETY OF CHARACTER ARE CON CERNED TOGETHER IN PRODUCING DISTURBANCES 2 WE MAY SUPPOSE A DISTURBANCE OCCASIONED BY ONE OR MORE GROUPS OF FORCES THE ELEMENTS OF WHICH ARE BOUND TOGETHER BY A CERTAIN LAW WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST OF THESE HYPOTHESES IT IS REFUTED BY THE DISCUSSION OF DISTURBING FORCES GIVEN BY GENERAL SABINE FOR THE DIFFERENT COLONIAL OBSERVATORIES AND FOR KEW AS WELL AS BY THE RESULTS IN TABLES I II AND III THE SECOND HYPOTHESIS MUST THEREFORE REPRESENT THE MODE OF ACTION OF THE FORCES CONCERNED 18 AND FIRST OF ALL IT MAY SAFELY BE AFFIRMED THAT NO DISTURBANCE OF ANY MAGNITUDE IS DUE TO THE ACTION OF A SINGLE FORCE MERELY VARYING IN AMOUNT FOR IF THIS WERE THE CASE THE DISTANCE AT ANY MOMENT OF A POINT IN THE CURVE OF ONE OF THE ELEMENTS FROM ITS NORMAL POSITION SHOULD BEAR THROUGHOUT A DISTURBANCE AN INVARIABLE PROPORTION TO THE DISTANCE OF A CORRESPONDING POINT IN THE CURVE OF ANOTHER OF THE ELEMENTS FROM ITS NORMAL BUT THIS IS BY NO MEANS TRUE SINCE THEREFORE A DISTURBANCE IS NOT A PHENOMENON DUE TO THE ACTION OF A SINGLE FORCE AND SINCE AT THE SAME TIME IT DOES NOT REPRESENT THE ACTION OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FORCES PROMISCUOUSLY HUDDLED TOGETHER IT BECOMES A QUESTION OF INTEREST TO ASK OURSELVES HOW WE MAY FIND THE ELEMENTARY FORCES CONCERNED 19 A LITTLE CONSIDERATION WILL SHOW THAT THIS IS LIKELY TO BE OBTAINED BY THE STUDY OF SMALL AND RAPID CHANGES OF FORCE FOR IF SEVERAL FORCES ARE AT WORK IT IS UNLIKELY THAT AT THE SAME MOMENT A SUDDEN CHANGE SHOULD TAKE PLACE IN ALL THERE IS THUS A HIGH PROBA BILITY THAT A SUDDEN AND RAPID CHANGE IS A CHANGE IN ONE OF THE ELEMENTARY FORCES CON CERNED AND WHICH WILL THEREFORE ENABLE US TO DETERMINE THE NATURE OF THAT FORCE EVEN IF THE CHANGE IS NOT A VERY ABRUPT ONE PROVIDED THAT WE CONFINE OURSELVES TO SUCH PEAKS AND HOLLOWS AS PRESENT A SIMILAR APPEARANCE FOR ALL THE CURVES WE MAY BE SATISFIED THAT WE ARE OBSERVING CHANGES TAKING PLACE IN ONE ONLY OF THE ELEMENTARY DISTURBING FORCES FOR IT IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT TWO OR MORE INDEPENDENT FORCES CHANGING INDEPENDENTLY SHOULD PRODUCE SIMILAR APPEARANCES IN ALL THE THREE CURVES THIS MAY BE ILLUSTRATED BY AN EXAMPLE SUPPOSE FOR INSTANCE A DISTURBANCE TAKES PLACE IN DECLINATION WHICH AT THE END OF ONE MINUTE HAS RAISED THE CURVE ONETENTH OF AN INCH WHILE AT THE END OF THE SECOND MINUTE IT HAS FALLEN AGAIN TO ITS ORIGINAL LEVEL SUPPOSE ALSO THAT A CHANGE PRECISELY THE SAME IN NATURE AND AMOUNT TAKES PLACE IN THE HORIZONTAL FORCE WHILE IN THE VERTICAL FORCE THE CHANGE IS ONLY ONETWENTIETH OF AN INCH HERE THEN WE HAVE IN OUR CURVES THREE ISOSCELES TRIANGLES WHICH ALTHOUGH THE LAST IS NOT STRICTLY SPEAKING SIMILAR TO THE OTHER TWO YET ALL THREE CONVEY THE IDEA OF ONLY ONE FORCE ACTING SUPPOSE NOW ANOTHER FORCE TO HAVE BEEN SUPERIMPOSED WHICH AFFECTED THE DECLINATION VERY MUCH MORE THAN EITHER OF THE FORCECOMPONENTS BUT WHICH DID NOT BEGIN TO WORK UNTIL THE END OF THE FIRST MINUTE THE RESULT WOULD BE THAT THE DECLINATION PEAK WOULD BE MUCH FURTHERMR B STEWART ON THE NATURE OF THE FORCES FROM AN ISOSCELES TRIANGLE THAN THAT OF EITHER OF THE FORCES WE MIGHT EVEN SUPPOSE THE THE DESCENDING LIMB OF THE DECLINATION PEAK TO BECOME LEVEL OR EVEN TO ASCEND IN CONSE QUENCE OF THE ACTION OF THIS SECOND FORCE THE FOLLOWING IS A MORE PRECISE DEFINITION OF WHAT IS REQUISITE BEFORE WE CAN REFER THE ACTION TO A PURE ELEMENTARY FORCE LET IT BE SUPPOSED THAT WE ARE COMPARING TOGETHER PORTIONS OF EACH OF THE THREE CURVES COMMENCING AT THE SAME TIME THEN IT MAY BE ASSERTED THAT THESE PORTIONS ARE DUE TO THE ACTION OF A SINGLE DISTURBING FORCE WHEN THE ORIGIN FOR EACH BEING THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE PORTION OF THE CURVE UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR EQUAL ABSCISSAE THE ORDINATES OF THE ONE CURVE ALWAYS BEAR A DEFINITE PROPORTION TO THOSE OF THE OTHER 20 THIS IS ILLUSTRATED BY THE FOLLOWING TRACINGS WHICH EXHIBIT THE MOVEMENTS OF THE THREE CURVES ON AUGUST 11 1860 FROM 234 PI TO 526 PM BEGINNING END  END D BEGINNING  END 21 FROM ALL THIS WE PERCEIVE THAT IN ORDER TO FIND WHAT ARE THE PURE ELEMENTARY FORCES AT WORK WE MUST SELECT SUITABLE PEAKS AND HOLLOWS AND MEASURE THESE ACCURATELY THE FOLLOWING TABLE EXHIBITS THE RESULTS OBTAINED BY COMPARING SUCH

FIND CHANGES IN THE VERTICAL FORCE WHICH ARE SIMILAR TO CORRESPONDING CHANGES IN THE HORIZONTAL FORCE YET IT IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO FIND SIMILAR CORRESPONDING CHANGES IN THE HORIZONTAL FORCE AND DECLINATION INDEED FOR MANY OF THE CASES RECORDED IN THE ABOVE TABLE THE DECLINATIONCHANGE WOULD NOT BE SIMILAR TO THAT OF EITHER FORCE IT THUS APPEARS THAT EVEN IN CASES WHICH DO NOT INDICATE THE ACTION OF A PURE ELEMENTARY DISTURBANCE THE HORIZONTALFORCE CHANGE PRESERVES AN ALMOST INVARIABLE RELATION TO THAT OF THE VERTICAL FORCE 23 THE FOLLOWING WOULD APPEAR TO BE THE EXPLANATION OF THIS

EFFECT UPON THE VERTICAL COMPONENT OF THE SAME IN THIS CASE IT IS CLEAR THAT TWO OR MORE DISTURBING FORCES SUPERIMPOSED WOULD AS FAR AS REGARDS THE HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL FORCE CHANGES BEHAVE ALMOST IN THE SAME MANNER AS A PURE ELEMENTARY DISTURBANCE THIS ALSO EXPLAINS WHY IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND A PEAK IN THE ONE COMPONENT OF THE FORCE CORRESPONDING TO A HOLLOW IN THE OTHER 24 THIS CURIOUS FACT MAY LIKEWISE BE STATED IN THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE WHATEVER BE THE NATURE OF THE DISTURBING FORCE AT WORK ITS RESOLVED PORTION WHICH ACTS IN THE PLANE OF THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN AT KEW IS ALWAYS IN NEARLY THE SAME LINE 25 IT IS VERY EASY TO FIND THE DIRECTION OF THIS LINE A DISTURBANCE OF THE HORIZONTAL FORCE AS IT APPEARS IN THE CURVE IS WE HAVE SEEN VERY NEARLY DOUBLE THAT OF THE VERTICAL FORCE NOW AN INCH IN THE ORDINATE OF THE HORIZONTAL FORCE CURVE DENOTES A CHANGE AMOUNTING TO NEARLY 010 OF THE WHOLE FORCE WHILE FOR THE VERTICALFORCE CURVE IT REPRESENTS A CHANGE OF 0025 OF THE WHOLE AND INCREASING ORDINATES DENOTE DECREASING FORCE FOR BOTH ELEMENTS ALSO THE ABSOLUTE VALUE OF THE HORIZONTAL FORCE IS 38 WHILE THAT OF THE VERTICAL FORCE IS 96 HENCE IF WE REPRESENT BY 38 THE VALUE OF THE HORIZONTAL COMPONENT OF THE DISTURBING FORCE IN THE PLANE OF THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN THAT OF THE VERTICAL COMPONENT WILL BE DENOTED BY 12 AND THE DIP OF THE WHOLE FORCE ACTING IN THIS PLANE WILL BE 175 NEARLY 26 FROM WHAT HAS BEEN ALREADY MENTIONED ART 22 IT MAY BE INFERRED THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN SIMILAR CORRESPONDING CHANGES FOR ALL THE ELEMENTS TOGETHER THE FOLLOWING

MUCH FROM ONE DISTURB ANCE TO ANOTHER THE CONSTANCY OF THIS ELEMENT DURING THE SAME DISTURBANCE WILL PERHAPS BE BEST SEEN BY COMPARING THE VALUES IN THE DECLINATION COLUMN WITH THOSE IN THE COLUMN OF THE HORIZONTAL FORCE AS THE VERTICALFORCE CHANGES BEING SMALL ANY ERROR OF MEASUREMENT IS VERY APT TO ALTER THE PROPORTION BETWEEN THEM AND THE LARGER CHANGES WITH WHICH THEY ARE COMPARED 28 IT WILL ALSO BE NOTICED THAT THE GREAT DISTURBANCE OF AUGUSTSEPTEMBER 1859 SEEMS TO CONSIST OF TWO DISTURBANCES SUPERIMPOSED ONE BEING OF THE NORMAL TYPE BUT THE OTHER AS REGARDS THE DECLINATIONELEMENT BEING DECIDEDLY ABNORMAL THIS AGREES WELL WITH THE RESULTS OF TABLE III 29 IT WOULD THUS APPEAR THAT IN THE GREAT MAJORITY OF CASES ONLY ONE TYPE OR GROUP OF FORCES OPERATES IN PRODUCING A DISTURBANCE AND THAT THE VARIOUS INDIVIDUAL FORCES WHICH COMPOSE THIS GROUP HAVE A VERY SMALL RANGE AS REGARDS THEIR MODE OF ACTION UPON THE THREE ELEMENTS OF THE EARTHS MAGNETISM AT KEW WE MAY THEREFORE APPROXIMATELY AT LEAST REPRESENT A DISTURBANCE BY A SINGLE FORCE AND FOR THIS PURPOSE IT IS COMPETENT FOR US TO AVERAGE FOR EACH DISTURBANCE THE RESULTS OF TABLE V 30 NOW THAT FORCE WHICH AFFECTS THE DECLINATION IS EVIDENTLY THE HORIZONTAL COMPONENT OF THE DISTURBING MAGNETIC FORCE WHICH ACTS IN A DIRECTION PERPENDICULAR TO THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN AND ITS VALUE WILL BE X TAN J WHERE X DENOTES THE ABSOLUTE HORIZONTAL FORCE AND U1 THE ANGULAR DISPLACEMENT OF THE DECLINATION MAGNET BUT AN INCH OF THE DECLINATION ORDINATE REPRESENTS 22 HENCE THE DISTURBING FORCE WHICH WOULD CAUSE A CHANGE TO THIS AMOUNT WILL BE 38 TAN 22024 WHILE AS WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN AN INCH OF CHANGE IN THE HORIZONTALFORCE ORDINATE DENOTES A DISTURBING FORCE 038 AGAIN DECREASING ORDINATES REPRESENT INCREASING WESTERLY DECLINATION AND SINCE EXCEPT IN ONE CASE THE THREE CURVES ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY AFFECTED IN THE SAME DIRECTION IT FOLLOWS THAT WITH THE SAME EXCEPTION A MAGNETIC FORCE ACTING FROM MAGNETIC SOUTH TO NORTH MUST BE COMPOUNDED WITH ONE ACTING FROM MAGNETIC EAST TO WEST AND WITH ONE ACTING VERTICALLY DOWNWARDS BUT FOR THE ANOMALOUS DISTURBANCE OF AUGUSTSEPTEMBER 1859 A FORCE ACTING FROM MAGNETIC SOUTH TO NORTH MUST BE COMPOUNDED WITH ONE ACTING FROM MAGNETIC WEST TO EAST APPLYING NOW THE ORDINARY RULES FOR COMBINING FORCES WE OBTAIN THE FOLLOWING TABLE IN WHICH THE ASTRONOMICAL AZIMUTH AND DIP OF THE VARIOUS DISTURBING FORCES ARE GIVEN 31 IT WILL HOWEVER BE FIRST NECESSARY TO ALLUDE TO A PECULIARITY IN THIS METHOD OF DE TERMINING THE DIRECTION OF THE DISTURBING FORCE THIS IS THAT OUR RESULTS APPLY IN STRICT NESS ONLY TO THOSE SMALL AND RAPID CHANGES WHICH OCCUR AS IT WERE ON THE SURFACE OF THE GREAT DISTURBANCEWAVE WE MIGHT FOR INSTANCE BE ENGAGED IN STUDYING THE DIRECTION OF THAT FORCE WHICH WOULD OCCASION A SMALL DEPRESSION WHICH WE HAD OBSERVED TO OCCUR SIMULTANEOUSLY IN THE THREE CURVES WHILE AT THE SAME TIME THESE CURVES MIGHT BE ELEVATED ABOVE THEIR NORMALS AND NOT DEPRESSED BY THE MAIN BODY OF THE DISTURBING FORCE WE HAVE HOWEVER IN ART 15 GIVEN GROUNDS FOR SUPPOSING THAT THESE SMALL AND RAPID PEAKS AND HOLLOWS DENOTE 634CONCERNED IN PRODUCING THE GREATER MAGNETIC DISTURBANCES 635 CHANGES IN THE MAIN BODY OF THE DISTURBING FORCE OUR RESULTS REGARDING THE PEAKS AND HOLLOWS MAY THEREFORE PERHAPS BE VIEWED AS APPLICABLE TO THE MAIN BODY OF THE FORCE BUT WE MUST BEAR IN MIND THAT WHILE WE MAY THUS BE ENABLED TO DETERMINE THE RESULTANT LINE OF ACTION OF THIS FORCE WE DO NOT YET LEARN WHETHER IT IS OF A POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE NATURE WHETHER IT MAY BE REPRESENTED BY A NORTH OR BY A SOUTH POLE THIS WILL BE RENDERED EVIDENT WHEN WE REFLECT THAT A SMALL DEPRESSION MAY BE DUE EITHER TO THE WEAKENING OF AN ELEVATING FORCE OR TO THE STRENGTHENING OF ONE OF AN OPPOSITE CHARACTER IT THUS APPEARS THAT THE NORTH OR SOUTH NATURE OF THE WHOLE DISTUBING FORCE MUST BE DETER MINED BY REFERENCE TO THE GENERAL APPEARANCE OF THE CURVE INDEED IT WILL BE AFTERWARDS SHOWN THAT WE HAVE GROUNDS FOR SUPPOSING TWO ANTAGONISTIC FORCES TO BE IN OPERATION AT ONCE TO FIX OUR THOUGHTS HOWEVER LET US SUPPOSE FOR THE FOLLOWING TABLE THE DISTURBING FORCE TO BE ONE WHICH INCREASES THE EARTHS HORIZONTAL INTENSITY AT KEW AND LET US CON SIDER ITS ACTION ON THE NORTH POLE OF THE NEEDLE TABLE VIREPRESENTING THE ASTRONOMICAL AZIMUTH AND DIP OF THE VARIOUS DISTURBING FORCES DIRECTION IN WHICH

OUR METHOD WHETHER THE WHOLE DISTURBING FORCE IS POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE THE FOLLOWING CONSIDERATIONS HOWEVER MAY SERVE TO ELUCIDATE THIS SUBJECT WE HAVE SEEN IN ART 18 THAT A DISTURBANCE CANNOT BE REPRESENTED BY THE ACTION OF A SINGLE FORCE AND WE HAVE ALSO SEEN ART 29 THAT THE VARIOUS FORCES WHICH COMPOSE A DISTURBING GROUP HAVE A VERY SMALL RANGE AS REGARDS THEIR MODE OF ACTION UPON THE THREE ELEMENTS THIS RANGE BEING ESPECIALLY SMALL WHEN THE TWO FORCEELEMENTS ARE COMPARED TOGETHER WE MIGHT THEREFORE HOPE TO FIND ON INSPECTING THE GENERAL APPEARANCE OF THE CURVES THAT THE TWO FORCEELEMENTS ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY RAISED OR DEPRESSED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR NORMALS NEARLY IN THE PROPORTION DENOTED BY THE NATURE OF THE DISTURBING FORCE WHOSE CHARACTER WE HAVE BEEN ANALYSINGMR B STEWART ON THE NATURE OF THE FORCES BUT THIS IS NOT OFTEN THE CASE AND ALTHOUGH GENERALLY BOTH ELEMENTS ARE ON THE SAME SIDE OF THEIR NORMALS YET IT HAPPENS OCCASIONALLY THAT THE ONE ELEMENT IS ABOVE WHILE THE OTHER IS BELOW WHILE ON SUCH OCCASIONS THERE IS NOTHING IN THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE PEAKS AND HOLLOWS TO INDICATE THE ACTION OF ANY OTHER THAN THE ORDINARY DISTURBING FORCE 33 THIS MAY PERHAPS BE EXPLAINED BY SUPPOSING TWO ANTAGONISTIC FORCES TO BE IN OPERATION AT ONCE THE ONE TENDING TO ELEVATE AND THE OTHER TO DEPRESS THE CURVE THE ABSOLUTE VALUES OF THESE FORCES BEARING A SOMEWHAT LARGE PROPORTION TO THEIR DIFFERENCES AND THE ONE FORCE AFFECTING THE ELEMENTS IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT MANNER FROM THE OTHER SUPPOSE FOR INSTANCE THAT 1 AND 1 DENOTE THE POSITION OF THE HORIZONTAL AND THE VERTICALFORCE CURVES AT THE SAME MOMENT THE FORMER BEING ELEVATED ABOVE ITS NORMAL AND THE LATTER DEPRESSED BELOW IT CONCEIVE THIS RESULT DUE TO THE ACTION OF AN ELEVATING FORCE REPRESENTED BY 40 20 OPPOSED BY A DEPRESSING ONE REPRESENTED BY 39 21 AND WE HAVE A SUFFICIENT EXPLA NATION OF THIS ANOMALOUS CIRCUMSTANCE WHILE AT THE SAME TIME BOTH THE ANTAGONISTIC FORCES SUFFICIENTLY PRESENT THE NORMAL TYPE 34 THE SAME STYLE OF REASONING WILL APPLY IN COMPARING THE DECLINATION CURVE WITH THAT OF EITHER FORCE ONLY HERE WE MUST SUPPOSE THAT THE ONE FORCE AFFECTS THE DECLINATION IN A SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT MANNER FROM ITS ANTAGONIST SO THAT THE PROPORTION BETWEEN A DECLINATION PEAK AND ONE OF EITHER FORCE IS NOT SO CONSTANT AS THAT BETWEEN PEAKS OF THE TWO FORCES THE IDEA OF TWO ANTAGONISTIC FORCES THE DIFFERENCE OF WHICH REPRESENTS THE VISIBLE ACTION SEEMS ALSO TO GIVE THE SIMPLEST EXPLANATION OF THE FACT THAT SOMETIMES A FORCE WHICH DEPRESSES ONE OF THE ELEMENTS WILL CHANGE IN THE COURSE OF A FEW HOURS TO ONE WHICH ELEVATES ITSINCE OTHERWISE WE MUST SUPPOSE THE DISTURBING FORCE TO HAVE CHANGED ITS CHARACTER THIS ALSO IS THE VIEW OF DISTURBING FORCES WHICH GENERAL SABINE WHO HAS STUDIED THE SUBJECT SO LONG AND SO SUCCESSFULLY HAS LATELY BEEN DISPOSED TO ADOPT ON OTHER GROUNDS AND I AM HAPPY TO THINK THAT THE IDEA HEREIN ADVOCATED IS THAT OF ONE WHOSE JUDGMENT IS SO MATURE AND WHOSE INFORMATION IS SO EXTENSIVE 35 ADOPTING THIS VIEW OF THE SUBJECT IT IS WORTHY OF REMARK THAT THE SAME ELEMENT OF THE DISTURBING FORCES THE DECLINATION WHICH CHANGES SO MUCH ITS COMPARATIVE VALUE FROM ONE DISTURBANCE TO ANOTHER CHANGES ALSO THE MOST OF THE THREE WHEN WE PASS FROM THE ONE TO THE OTHER OF THE ANTAGONISTIC FORCES CONCERNED IN THE SAME DISTURBANCE IN CONCLUSION I MAY BE ALLOWED TO STATE THAT THIS PAPER IS SUBMITTED TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY RATHER AS INDICATING A METHOD OF ANALYSIS THAN AS EMBODYING THE RESULTS OF AN INVESTIGATION 636CONCERNED IN PRODUCING THE GREATER MAGNETIC DISTURBANCES 637 NOTE ON THE ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE INDUCED IN THE EARTHS CRUST BY VARIATIONS OF TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM BY PROF W THOMSON AM LLD FRS THE EVIDENCE FROM OBSERVATION ADDUCED IN THE PRECEDING PAPER TENDING TO SHOW THAT SOME EARTHCURRENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN ACTUALLY OBSERVED HAVE BEEN THE ELECTROMAG NETICALLY INDUCED EFFECTS OF VARIATIONS OF TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM APPEARS TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE DISCOVERY OF THE COMPLETE THEORY OF THESE MOST INTERESTING AND PERPLEXING PHENOMENA IT NECESSARILY HOWEVER SUGGESTS THE QUESTION IS THE ELEC TROMOTIVE FORCE INDUCED BY VARIATIONS OF TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM COMPARABLE IN AMOUNT WITH THAT WHICH IS FOUND IN OBSERVATIONS ON EARTHCURRENTS  THERE IS SCARCELY OCCASION AT PRESENT FOR WORKING OUT A COMPLETE MATHEMATICAL THEORY OF THE CURRENTS INDUCED IN THE EARTHS CRUST BY ANY FULLY SPECIFIED MAGNETIC VARIATIONS THIS CAN EASILY BE DONE AS SOON AS OBSERVATION SUPPLIES DATA ENOUGH TO MAKE IT USEFUL IN THE MEAN TIME A VERY ROUGH THEORETICAL ESTIMATE OF THE ABSOLUTE AMOUNT OF ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE INDUCED BY SUCH MAGNETIC VARIATIONS AS WE KNOW TO EXIST IS SUFFICIENT TO RENDER IT CERTAIN THAT THIS ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION DOES VERY SENSIBLY INFLUENCE THE OBSERVED PHENOMENA OF EARTH CURRENTS FOR IF THERE BE AS WE KNOW THERE IS EVERY DAY A GRADUAL VARIATION OF TERRES TRIAL MAGNETISM OVER A LARGE PORTION OF THE EARTHS SURFACE AMOUNTING TO A MINUTE OF ANGLE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE DIPPINGNEEDLE OR TO SOME THOUSANDTHS OR NOT MUCH LESS THAN ONE THOUSANDTH OF FORCE DURING SEVERAL HOURS THIS CHANGE OF MAGNETISM MUST INDUCE IN A LENGTH OF A FEW HUNDRED MILES IN THE EARTHS CRUST AN ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE WHICH WE READILY SEE MUST BE COMPARABLE WITH THAT WHICH WOULD BE INDUCED IN A LINEAR CONDUCTOR OF THE SAME LENGTH IF CARRIED ACROSS THE LINES OF MAGNETIC FORCE AT THE RATE OF A MINUTE OF ARC OR A NAUTICAL MILE IN SEVERAL HOURS IN TWO ARTICLES COMMUNI CATED ELEVEN YEARS AGO TO THE PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE  I EXPLAINED THE PRINCIPLES ON WHICH SUCH AN ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE AS THIS IS TO BE COMPARED WITH FAMILIAR STANDARDS AS FOR INSTANCE THAT OF AN ELEMENT OF DANIELLS BATTERY THUS A HORIZONTAL CONDUCTOR 1400000 FEET LONG OR ABOUT 270 BRITISH STATUTE MILES CARRIED AT THE RATE OF 600 FEET OR ABOUT ONETENTH OF A MINUTE OF ARC PER HOUR IN A HORIZONTAL DIRECTION PERPENDICULAR TO ITS OWN LENGTH ACROSS THE BRITISH ISLES OR NEIGHBOURING ATLANTIC OCEAN WHERE THE VERTICAL MAGNETIC FORCE AVERAGES ABOUT 10 BRITISH ABSOLUTE UNITS OF MAGNETIC FORCE WOULD EXPERIENCE AN INDUCED ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE AMOUNTING TO 30 X 10 X 1400000 OR ABOUT 2300000 BRITISH ABSOLUTE UNITS OF ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE BUT AS I SHOWED IN THE SECOND OF THOSE ARTICLES THE ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE OF A SINGLE CELL OF DANIELLS IS ABOUT 2500000 BRITISH ABSOLUTE UNITS HENCE THE INDUCED ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE IN QUESTION IS ABOUT EQUAL TO THAT OF A SINGLE CELL SOME SUCH ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE AS THIS THEREFORE MUST BE INDUCED IN A LENGTH OF 270 MILES OF THE EARTHS CRUST BY THE ORDINARY DIURNAL VARIA TIONS OF TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM AND THE MUCH MORE RAPID VARIATIONS IN MAGNETIC STORMS  SEE 1851 SECOND HALF YEAR ON THE MECHANICAL THEORY OF ELECTROLYSIS AND APPLICATIONS OF THE PRINCIPLE OF MECHANICAL EFFECT TO THE MEASUREMENT OF ELECTROMOTIVE FORCES AND OF GALVANIC RESISTANCES IN ABSOLUTE UNITSPROFESSOR THOMSONS NOTE ON THE FOREGOING PAPER MUST PRODUCE MUCH GREATER ELECTROMOTIVE FORCES WHICH WE MAY CONCEIVE MAY NOT UNFRE QUENTLY BE AS MUCH AS THAT OF TEN OR TWENTY CELLS AND SOMETIMES MAY AMOUNT TO 100 CELLS OR MORE JUST SUCH AMOUNTS OF ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE WERE THOSE WHICH I ACTUALLY OBSERVED IN THE ATLANTIC CABLE AS THE FOLLOWING EXTRACT FROM THE  ENCYCLOPEEDIA METRO POLITANA ARTICLE TELEGRAPH ELECTRIC SHOWS  IN THE FAILURE OF THE ATLANTIC CABLE IN SEPTEMBER 1858 THE PORTION TERMINATING AT VALENCIA CAME TO GIVE NEARLY THE SAME INDICATIONS AS AN INSULATED CONDUCTOR ABOUT 270 MILES LONG LAID OUT WESTWARD AND CONNECTED WITH A COPPER PLATE SUNK AT A LITTLE LESS THAN THAT DISTANCE IN THE ATLANTIC IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE WRITER FOUND THAT FROM I TO 9 OR 10 TWENTIETHS OF THE ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE OF TWO DANIELLS ELEMENTS WAS GENERALLY SUFFICIENT TO BALANCE THE EARTHCURRENT NOT UNFREQUENTLY 14 OR 15 WERE REQUIRED SOMETIMES ALTHOUGH RARELY 20 OR THE FULL ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE OF TWO DANIELLS ELEMENTS WAS INSUFFICIENT AND ONCE OR TWICE IN THE COURSE OF THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER EARTHCURRENTS WERE RECEIVED SO STRONG THAT FIVE OR SIX DANIELLS ELEMENTS WOULD HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO BALANCE THEM IT SEEMS THEREFORE QUITE CERTAIN THAT THE ORDINARY EVERYDAY EARTHCURRENTS IN THAT LOCALITY MUST BE VERY SENSIBLY INFLUENCED BY ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION FROM THE ORDINARY DIURNAL VARIATIONS OF TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM BUT ITIS ALSO QUITE CERTAIN THAT THEY ARE ONLY IN PART DUE TO THIS CAUSE AND THAT SOME MORE POWERFUL BUT AS YET UNKNOWN AGENCY IS AT WORK TO PRODUCE THEM FOR ALTHOUGH I FOUND THAT A DAY SELDOM IF EVER PASSES WITHOUT THE DIRECTION OF THE CURRENT CHANGING SEVERAL TIMES YET THERE WAS NO RELATION BETWEEN THE TIMES OF SUCH CHANGES AND THE SOLAR HOURS I CONCLUDE WITH THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL EXTRACT FROM THE SAME ARTICLE EXPRESSING VIEWS REGARDING EARTHCURRENTS WHICH I THINK WILL BE FOUND TO AGREE WITH THE EXTENSIVE AND CAREFUL OBSERVATIONS OF MR C V WALKER WHICH HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED SINCE IT WAS WRITTEN ALTHOUGH THEY SEEM QUITE AT VARIANCE WITH THE THEORY WHICH HAS RECENTLY BEEN ADVOCATED BY PROF LAMONT AND DR LLOYD THAT EARTHCURRENTS HOWEVER THEY ARE THEMSELVES GENERATED DO DIRECTLY PRODUCE THE MAGNETIC VARIATIONS EARTHCURRENTS ARE CERTAINLY RELATED TO THE IRREGULAR VARIATIONS OF TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM SINCE THEY ARE ALWAYS FOUND UNUSUALLY STRONG DURING BRILLIANT DISPLAYS OF AURORA BOREALIS FOR IT HAS LONG BEEN KNOWN THAT ON THESE OCCASIONS THE MAGNETIC DISTURBANCES ARE UN USUALLY STRONG BEING RELATED TO THE VARIATIONS OF TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE EARTHCURRENTS ALSO WILL BE FOUND TO HAVE DAILY PERIODS BUT IN THE MEAN TIME WE ONLY KNOW THAT WHILE THE DIURNAL VARIATION IN TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM IS OBSERVABLE IN GENERAL EVERY DAY AND IS ONLY ON RARE OCCASIONS OVERBORNE BY IRREGULAR DISTURBANCES THE EARTHCURRENTS VARY EACH DAY FROM HOUR TO HOUR LIKE THE WIND UNDER SOME OVERPOWERING NONPERIODIC INFLUENCE AND CAN ONLY SHOW DAILY PERIODICITY IN RESIDUAL AVERAGES DERIVED FROM LENGTHENED SERIES OF OBSERVATIONS IT IS PROBABLE THAT CAREFUL SYNCHRONOUS OBSER VATIONS OF AURORAS EARTHCURRENTS AND VARIATIONS OF TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM WILL LEAD TO A DISCOVERY OF THE PRIMARY INFLUENCE WHETHER IN THE EARTH OR TERRESTRIAL ATMOSPHERE OR SURROUNDING INTERPLANETARY AIR WHICH CAUSES THESE PHENOMENAW T 638

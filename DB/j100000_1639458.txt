ent salts mutually offset each others physio logical deficiencies but they are able to offset the usually harmful action of the solvent Loeb has found an interesting experimental subject in Fundulus a fish which is at home not only in the complete mixture but which likewise survives for a time in distilled water In the case of organisms which survive indefi nitely in distilled water it is likely that many do so largely by virtue of the salts contained in their own bodies In general it appears that pure water extracts ions more or less rapidly from many plants and animals and in case the experimental organism in question is of con siderable size and the volume of water suffi ciently limited the medium may easily get enough ions from the experimental plant or animal to offset the harmful action of the pure water The ability of Fundulus heteroclitus to part with considerable quantities of salts to fresh water without immediately evident injury has been shown by Sumner This fish is however hardly typical of marine organ isms as a whole In the red algse incomplete mixtures are injurious as in Fzundulus but unlike it they are promptly killed by distilled water which for them must be listed with the other constituents which taken individually act as fatal poisons In this case the mix ture of salts is required to antagonize or efface the action of the water A harmful ac tion has been shown to characterize distilled water when used as a medium for various land plants as well and to antagonize or efface this harmful action certain mixtures of salts strikingly reminiscent of sea water in many important points the socalled nutrient solu tions were long since devised by Knop Sachs and others It has been shown more recently by Osterhout and others that the socalled nutrient salts are toxic to land plants when taken individually in much greater dilution than has been generally supposed In both sea water and the more or less dilute nutrient solutions present in the soil normal life is sustained as a rule only in mixtures of proper proportions and necessary concentra tion Since salts are required in both cases to overcome the harmful action of pure water as well as that of the salts themselves there seems to be no reason to seek to limit the use of the term balanced solutions in the man ner suggested by Loeb and Osterhout Unless we admit that malnutrition due to a deficiency in nutrient salts is a form of toxicity excited by the substances present we can hardly escape the alternative proposition that the missing salts are injurious in absentia RODNEY H TRUE BUREAU OF PLANT INDUSTRY U S DEPT OF AGRICULTURE ON THE OSMOTIC PRESSURE OF THE JUICES OF DESERT PLANTS IN 1907 Drabble and Drabblel argued from a series of plasmolyzations of the leaf cells of a number of British plants from a range of habitats that physiological dryness of the substratum is the primary factor in the de termination of the osmotic strength of the contents of the leaf cells of flowering plants About four years later Fitting2 applied the plasmolytic method in an extensive reconnais sance physiological study of the vegetation of the rocky peaks and slopes of the Chaine de Sfa and the adjacent lowlands comprising concentrated salt marsh and arable oasis Here he reports some enormously high con centrations of cell sap such indeed as would theoretically give pressures of over 100 at mospheres if confined in suitable semiperme able membranes surrounded by pure water The results of these two papers force upon one the conviction that observations of the concentration of the cell sap may form a legit imate and indeed essential feature of com prehensive and thoroughgoing ecological or phytogeographical study One must note however that the number of observations from each habitat studied by Drabble and Drabble was small and that their maximum intensity of dryness was not very great Again there is no satisfactory series of determinations of the osmotic pressure of the sap of mesophytic plants to serve as a 1 Drabble and Drabble BioChem Jor 2 1907 2 Fitting Zeitschr f Bot 3 1911 656 SCIENCEAPRIL 30 1915 SCIENCE basis of comparison for

to us highly desir able that further series of evidence should be gathered Such data to be of real value should comprise extensive series of as nearly as possible comparable determinations from desert and moist regions The technique which seemed to us the most trustworthy is the wellknown freezingpoint lowering method The director of the department of botanical reseatch of the Carnegie Institution of Wash ington made it possible for two of us to carry out a series of cryoscopic determinations on the spring flora of the vicinity of Tucson Ari C 0 or 0 SC 64 O S percentage frequencies of osmotic

draughtsmans curves smoothing the empirical frequencies but for present pur poses they are quite good enough From such curves one may read off at once the relative frequencies of pressures of dif ferent grades Thus for the Cold Spring Harbor series fifty per cent of the pressures are about 105 atmospheres or lower whereas in the Desert series fifty per cent of the pressures are 157 atmospheres or higher In the Tucson series about thirty per cent of the concentrations are the equivalent of over 20 at mospheres whereas in the Cold Spring Harbor series only about three per cent of the cases exceed this value Note also that in the Desert there is a higher maximum and a higher minimum than in the more mesophytic habitat The range of variation is also far greater in the Tucson than in the Cold Spring Harbor series In using cryoscopic methods we have so far failed to find pressures so high as those re corded by Fitting We are not however ready to suggest that they do not occur Pos sibly our failure to demonstrate them in the Tucson region may be due to the fact that our determinations were carried out at the close of the winter and spring rainy season and hence on plants which had not been subjected to the maximum dryness of the region in question during the growing season of the year in which the determinations were made J ARTHUR HARRIS JOHN V LAWRENCE Ross AITKEN GORTNER ON THE GENUS TRACHODON1 IN 1902 Mr J B Hatcher published an article2 entitled The Genera and Species of cooling by the use of tables already published See Harris and Gortner Amer Jour Bot 1 1914 1

conclusion was reached that the ten genera of the Trachodontidae which have been proposed should be reduced to two Trachodon Leidy and Claosaurus Marsh while the remaining eight genera should be treated as synonyms of Trachodon which should also be made to include T Claosaurus annectens Marsh while the smaller Claosaurus agilis described by Marsh from the Kansas chalks Niobrara may still be considered as pertaining to a distinct genus  These conclusions were almost unanimously adopted by American vertebrate paleontol ogists in their subsequent work and this gen eral use of the term Trachodon has continued up to the present time The finding of more perfect material in re cent years has shown that several of the species formerly referred to Trachodon represent dis tinct genera and in the light of these dis coveries Hatchers reduction now appears to have been too radical but he was probably correct in restricting Claosaurus to the single species from the Niobrara formation It is unfortunate however that this view of the genus Trachodon which includes spe cies from the Judith River formation to the close of the Lance has become so widely accepted by paleontologists In the first place the type of the genus Trachodon mirabilis Leidy is from the Judith River formation and was founded upon inadequate material consisting of specimens of teeth generally very much worn and in a fragmentary condition so that it is quite impossible to identify positively with them better and subsequently discovered specimens That later Hatcher3 appreciated this fact is clearly shown by the following extract Although the trachodonts are easily distinguish able by their teeth from the other Dinosauria of these beds Judith Biver it is scarcely possible to identify the various species of this genus or the genera of the family from the teeth alone Even though it eventually be found that S T W Stanton and J B Hatcher Geology and Paleontology of the Judith River Beds Bull 257 U S Geol

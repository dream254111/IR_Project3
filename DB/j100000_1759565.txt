mound or cutting a ditch or two through it but every foot of earth is removed and the whole structure laid bare foot by foot This mode of work has led to the discovery of singular and remarkable structures not only in the mound and at the natural level of the surrounding land but for six feet be neath this to the underlying graveldeposit These operations have brought so many novel facts to light that we have now the right to class all former moundexplorations in the Ohio valley as so superficial as to be scientifically worthless until further thorough work on groups not yet destroyed shall give the means of com parison and place the partial results that were formerly obtained in their proper relations The recent explorations have shown conclu sively that the mounds and earthworks in vari ous parts of the country were made at greatly different periods of time and presumably by different peoples even should it be ascer tained that they all belonged to the great Mon goloid stock of which our Indians probably represent more than one subdivision This however is not yet proved and the conclusions that have been drawn from time to time that there has only been one people on this conti nent who made the earthworks of various kinds are too hasty deductions from the present im perfect knowledge of our archeology That some Indian tribes made mounds and earth works and fortifications is not to be questioned and that others did not is probably equally true but this does not give us the right to throw over board other facts tending to show that peoples of various stages of development and so far as craniological and artistic conclusions can be at present drawn of distinct ethnical stocks were also former inhabitants of this continent One man will class all the past and present native inhabitants of all America both north and south as Indians the next with equal assurance will state that the ancient Mexicans the builders of the stone structures in Yucatan the old Peruvian and other SouthAmerican na NCE 775 tions etc were races distinct from the North American Indians and there have been many variations from these theories The fact is we do not know who the Indians are or who were the old builders of Palenque of Uxmal of Tiahuanuco and numerous other old cities from Mexico to the eastern side of the Andes in South America Until we awake to the fact that America has an inter esting past and can arouse ourselves to the effort of making out the ancestors and descend ants of all these peoples who have left us such marked differences in their architecture their works of art their customs and their languages we act the part of amateurs when from a little knowledge of a few of these different conditions and from superficial or very general resem blances we draw hasty conclusions Only the most thorough explorations conducted by men who have broad views and careful methods of work  men who are above being led by theo ries to be maintained who will look at facts in the same manner as a geologist or a biologist looks at his facts letting them lead him where they will  will solve for us the great problems of American archeology The days of collect ors of curiosities and hasty writers are over Archeology is a science and no longer in the hands of the mercenary dealer and the equally avaricious collector of curiosities Give the proper institutions the support they ask for and the near future will bring valuable results LETTERS TO THE EDITOR  Correspondents are requested to be as brief as possible The writers name is in all cases required as proof of good faith Gyration of a vibrating pendulum IF a body move in any curve about any centre of curvature the inertia of the body is manifested as a force acting in the plane of the curve and in a direc tion opposite to that of the centre of curvature and if v denote the lineal velocity of the body and p its distance from the centre of curvature the force thus manifested will be represented by  and is called the centrifugal force due the motion If the body move in a straight line on a limited portion of the earths surface while the earth is ro tating on its polar axis its motion may be regarded without sensible error as being on a tangent plane and because any tangent plane rotates about an axisSCIENCE VOL III No 73 normal to that plane with a constant angular velocity sin2t where c is the angular velocity of the earth about its polar axis and a is the latitude of the nor mal axis the path of the body in space will evi dently be a spiral curve and from the properties of that spiral the centrifugal force at its origin which is the deflecting force resulting from the earths motion on its axis is readily found to be 2o siin see Science iii No 57 The same result that is here found from the prop erties of the spiral which the body describes in space was found by Mr Ferrel from the equations of motion on a spherical surface see eq 53 Professional papers of the signalservice No viii 1882 p 30 but by assuming that the motion of the body in space is in the circumference of a circle he finds for the time T of a revolution in that circumference  r  sec 0 X  day and he says  The gradual gyration of a vibrating pendulum is caused by this same deflecting force and hence the time of gyration is the same as that of T in the preceding equation But it is well known that the time of gyration of a vibrating pendulum is sec 0 X 1 day This discrepancy may be explained as follows  Let P represent the position of the normal axis or centre of the tangent plane ABCD which therefore suppose the body to describe the circumference of the circle s by moving along the radius vector PA while the radius vector rotates about P the circum ference of s will obviously be described while the A B s ID t4A Cv radius vector makes a halfrevolution about P that is in the time   sec0 x day The time r of gyration of a vibrating pendulum however does not correspond with the time T in which the circle s would rotates about P with the velocity X sin A or e cos 0 be described but is if we adopt Mr Ferrels notation and because the PAA is described ar radius of curvature at P is the same for the spiral r  PAA as for the circle s the centrifugal force at P as has been abundantl will be the same whether the body move in the spiral or in the circumference of the circle s but if we Des Moines Io May 29 the time in which the spiral id hence sec X1 day ly proved by experiment J  HENDRICKS 716

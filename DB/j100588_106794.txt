JuneX g t7g SIRS ALTHOUGH many chemists are at present satisfiecl of the nola entity of what was formerly suppowd to be a body callecR phlogiston and considered as alel eletnent ontained in lxletals when in their metallic form yet this supposition has inter vvroven itself so much into chemistry in general and has been so unisrersally received that it maytlot be stlperfluous to re late the following experirnents If you are of that opinionS I shall be obliged to you if you will lay them before the Royal Society When a man begins to malQe an experiment however svell digested his plan lmay be lle finds when he comes to put it in executiony that he 1USt make a great ntlmber of experitnents Lefore he can bring the fact to be proved or disproved fairly in issue if I may take a phrase frotrA 1asv there are first mally buts and rebuts It has often been the practice to bring all this previous matter before the public This practice may be rery proper although it does llot seem so to me and there fore I have not troubleci the Society with the difficulties and disappointments I have met with but have brought the simple experiments forwarct in such manner asthat they callDr FORDSCE on tbe Calse of the vdditional Meight Ac 37Sv be easily repeated by any person who is at all rersed in che mistry and possesses those luoSt necessary qualifications irt this scierce patience and accuracy I amj Sir Your most obliged hlllnble sersrantf Gi FORDYCEc ft has been a great deslderatum almong chemists to deter tnine the cause of the additional weight wllich lnetals acquire when they are calcined To investigate this subject I had begun the follonving experiment many years ago but warious other engagements have sc zuuch interruptedl me that I have had but little time to pursue any other chemical inquiry than such as were necessary to form the catalogue of the ores and tinerals in Dr HUNTERS museum There is great difficulty itl chooslng the metal on which in quiry should be instituted on account of the differences of their calces After a nutnber of trials I chose ZillC AS that whose calces appeared to diSer the least from one aructher in other respects there are great objections to it likewise but whicl may be got over I took a portion o the zint I employed and dissolved it in vitriolic acid with which it znade a clear solution without any of that hlack luatter which commonly separates cluring its solutioll when we employ zinc imported from abroad After precipitating it by an alkali and exposing the calx to the air it remained of a pure white  so that it could contain no ironO This zinc was reduced to its perfect metallic form by breaking it irlto small particles and meltirlg it with black flux taliing t11at part of it only whicll was at the bottom of the crucible SC 23  hRDYCE X U aal F0t I reduced this nzetal to a calx by dissolving it in vitriolic acid diluted with waters and precipitated it by kali purum dit solved itl water In doing this the acid shoultl be dilllted with bur or five tlmes its weight of vvtater atld the zinc should be dissolvecl very slowly avoiding 11eat as much as pkossible during the solution If this precaution is IlOt taken a quantity of firo latile vitriolic acid svill be produced and spoil the experi ment Ill the precipitatiotl the alliali is apt to redissolve the calx if Gare be not taken to use it ill solution in water and that the solution TS diluted with a large quantity of water the propor tion Vin snrhich the water is itl aqua hali puri of the Lolldon Dis pensatory is a conYnient solution offthe alkali Care must likewise be takens in ttle precipitationthat the solu tion of the kali be poured illtO the solution of the zigum vitriola tuun in wrater by a little at a times arld that tlle szrhole be perfectly mixed together lefbre a fresh quantity is poured itl otherwise part of the cals will be redissolved It is firther necessary that the exact qualltyty of kZi putum be uwd iwf too little is used the whole calx will not he separated  if too much part of the calx will be redissolvedw It is also newssary that the alkali be perfectly pure especially free ko3n fixed air s that sstould be transfErred to the calx and as it flies off when the kali is sinlply united wsith vitriols acid the acouracy of the experiment would be thus destroyed The weight of the calx by whicll it exceeds the weight     I use the name of fixed air although certainly not proper in order X avoid rlanning into conision by employing those which have beerl given to thi substanct until the plurality of voices

vitriolic acid purified by distilla tion about txwo poursds it not beitlg material what qualltity was takell exactlyg I diluted it with distilled vnlater about four or fve titnes its sveight by guess the exact proportion being also immaterial I applied to 1ooo graitas of this diltlted acict a sufficiellt quantity lor saturation of czquct kali puri of tTe Lonlon Dispensatory rerldered pure from fixed air as is pre scribed in the process of the College I poaared in the aq kalipuri to tile diluted acid by a little at a tiinen until it was nearly saturated I then poured in sotne juice of violets which gave the vhole a red colour I cotltirlued to add aqua kali puri by a little at a time until the recl colour just disappeared I added the aqua kali tgri to the acid ratlaer thala the acid to tlle alkali because the 1QSS of tlae red colour at the point of sa turation can be discerned mucll better tilan tlae loss of the yel low colour which the alkali intermXes with the natural blue I ascertained the weight of tlle aqucl kali puri by Sweighing the bottle colltainin it before any vvas poured into tX acida578 Dr FORDYCE on the Cause of tbe addltlonal Meight alad after the saturation took place the deficiency of weight afterwards beingothe weight of the quattali puri applied to the acid for the saturation this was zoI47 grains I also weiglled the vessel with the acid before the aqua kali puri was poured ina and afterwards and found the increase of weight to be exactly the same as the weight of the aquol kali puri alld juice of violets so that nothing ras lost during the operation This experiment was three tiines repeated taking the pOillt of satulation from the eye The quantities of aqua kali purl eluployed were found to be tol47 grairls7 zoo45 grainsX oolSo grains I took lol48 grains beillg the mean of tlle three exper snents and applied it to tooo grains of the same vitriolic acid evaporated the water to dryness7 and heated it to a red heat to drive off the whole of the water  and found 978 grains of hali zJitriolatum remailling By this means I ascertained the quantity of kall znitriolatum produced from looo grains of tTle diluted vitriolic acid when saturated with kali I took looo grains of the diluted lritriolic acids and put it lnto a vessel of tlle form in the figure annexed Tab X I added zinc to it until it would dissolve no more I caught during the soliition the illflammable air which weighed g grains and svhose specific gravity was to atmospheric air as somehat less than 1 to o The vessel contained the whole of the acid and the zint in the globular part marked A the acid being introduced by a funnel The solution svas terrnirlated in five days when part of the tube D being broke oR it was left to stanct for fourand twenty hours to

tlae globe B being the quan tity sufficient to saturate looo grains of vitriolic acid as before determined Then the tube V was hermetically sealed and the whole weighed The vessel was then raised so that the globe A was undermost this was done very graduallyg so that the aqua kali pari was gradually addtecS to the solution of the zitlc urhell a little was poured in the vessel svas brought intQ an horizolltal position again and shaken a little this was repeated until the whole of the aqua kali puri svas poured in The zinc was thus precipitated in the form of a calx It was suffiered to stand for fortyeight hours  no aIteation of the gravity took place therefore notllng had enterecl through tlle glass to give additional weight to the zirlc ill order to calcine it The next step was to open the

kalt with pure Nrater repeatedly applied until it came away as pure as when appliecl to all seSzsiDle trials The qvlantity of water used was above four pounds I evaporated tItis water to dryness arld zeated tlle mass red hoty to expel the whole of the water it weighed seven grains more than the vitriolated tartar procured from applyillg the acid and alkali as above After evaporating the water I dissolved the mass again in s ounces Troy sreight of pure water a yellowish powder separated The solution of the vitriolated tartar cleared of this powders was again eva porated to dryness and the water of crystallization driven ofE It now weighed 976IX6 grainss which is nearly two grains less than the vitriolated tartar I obtained frotu the acid and alkali applied simply together without the intervention of the sinc The vitriolated tartar now obtained was free from any mix ture he additional weight of tlae ctalx of the zinc did not arise therefore from either the acid or the alkali it remains there fore that it arose from the water The weight of the calx of the zinc was ascertained by dry sngFit after washing out the vitriolated tartars heating it to a red heat and aftersrards weighing it The weight of the ZillC dissolved in saturating the acid was w6 grains ihe weight of the calx 220 grains The additional weight was therefore S6 grainstbicb Metals acqmire by being calcined 38t If it arose from the water then a quantity of water equal ito the weight by which the calx exceeds the metal must be lost sn the operation To determine this I performed a distillation xn the follovv ing manner  I put looo grains of the same diluted vitriolic acid into the globe A of the same apI3aratus then introduced the quantity of squa kalz puri found necessary to saturate it The tube D was then bent downwards about the middle and the apparatus brought to an horizontal position so that the bent part of the tube svas in a perpendicular direction downwards to tllis I affixed a small phial atld weighed tlle wholee I then lout the globe B irs a box filled with ice and applied heat tc the globe A so as to clistil over the water into the globe B Xthe liquor llever lJeillg brought to the boiling pointo NVhen the matter in the globe A became dry the heat was itltreased to a red olle to distil ourer likewise the water of crystallizatiorl The whole apparatus was now ureiglled and found not to llave lost a grain nor was there any water in the phial I then cracked the tube Cs btr applying a red hot iron to itn and letting a drop of cold water fall upon it I next weighed tile globe B with the water in it then poured aut the water atld let the glass dry I weighed the glass the deficient weigllt from the fsormer eighingg being the weight of the vaterX was oog8 grainse I repeated tlle experilnellt with this difference I put looo grains of tlae same vitriolic acid into the globe A then in troduced the quarltity of ZillC sufficient to saturate it r took the weight of

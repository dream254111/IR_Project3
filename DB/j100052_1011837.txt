KENTUCKY CHILD LABOR ASSOCIATION THE KENTUCKY CHILD LABOR ASSOCIATION WAS ORGANIZED IN FEBRUARY I907 ITS DECLARED PURPOSES WERE THE COLLECTION AND DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION CONCERNING THE WORKING CHILDREN OF KENTUCKY THE CULTIVATION OF A PUBLIC OPINION FAVORABLE TO A REASONABLE REGULATION OF CHILD LABOR AND THE PROPOSAL OF MEASURES FOR SUCH REGULATION BY GOVERNMENT IT WAS CONTEMPLATED THAT ITS ACTIVITY SHOULD BE STATEWIDE IN THIS RESPECT THE HOPES OF ITS PROMOTERS HAVE BEEN UP TO THIS TIME ONLY PARTIALLY FULFILLED IN LOUISVILLE WHICH IS THE CHIEF INDUSTRIAL CITY OF THE STATE ITS ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN THOROUGH AND ITS INFLUENCE CONSIDERABLE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE IT CANNOT BE SAID TO HAVE EXERTED ANY MARKED INFLUENCE EXCEPT THROUGH THE PASSAGE OF THE CHILD LABOR LAW HEREAFTER DESCRIBED WHICH IS OF COURSE APPLICABLE TO THE ENTIRE STATE THE LAW OF KENTUCKY IN FORCE WHEN THIS ASSOCIATION WAS ORGANIZED ACT OF MARCH I7 I906 MAY BE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS ACT OF MARCH 17TH I906 CHILDREN AFFECTED CLASS I CHILDREN UNDER FOURTEEN CLASS II CHILDREN BETWEEN FOURTEEN AND SIXTEEN EMPLOYMENTS PROHIBITED TO CLASS I UNDER FOURTEEN A AT ALL TIMES EMPLOYMENT IN ANY FACTORY

REGULATIONS DEFECTS IN THE OLD LAW THE TWO CHIEF EVILS WHICH WERE DEVELOPED IN THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THIS LAW WERE FIRST THE ABUSE BY PARENTS OF THE POWER GIVEN THE COUNTY JUDGE TO MAKE AN EXCEPTION TO THE PROHIBITION BY THE ISSUANCE OF THE PER MIT AND SECOND THE UTTER BREAKDOWN OF THE METHOD PROVIDED FOR PROVING THE AGE OF APPLICANTS FOR EMPLOYMENT A CAREFUL INVESTIGATION EXTENDING OVER A PERIOD OF ONE YEAR DISCLOSED AN APPALLING AMOUNT OF PERJURY AND FRAUD ON THE PART OF PARENTS WHO SOUGHT TO PUT AT WORK LITTLE CHILDREN UPON THE FALSE PRETEXT OF FAMILY NECESSITY A SIMILAR

OBJECTIONS TO THE PASSAGE OF THIS ACT I THAT IT WOULD THROW OUT OF EMPLOYMENT MORE CHILDREN THAN THE EXISTING SCHOOLS COULD ACCOMMODATE 2 THAT IT WOULD MAKE LOAFERS OF MANY CHILDREN WHO HAVING HAD NO SCHOOLING AT ALL COULD NOT BE EXPECTED AT THE AGE OF THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN TO ENTER CLASSES WITH CHILDREN WHO WERE FOUR OR FIVE OR SIX YEARS YOUNGER THAN THEMSELVES 3 THAT THE PENALTIES WERE TOO HEAVY AND PARTICULARLY THAT THE PENALTY OF IMPRISONMENT WAS UNNECESSARILY OFFENSIVE I74REPORTS FROM CHILD LABOR COMMITTEES 4 THAT THE REQUIREMENT THAT CHILDREN SHOULD NOT BE EMPLOYED AFTER 7 P M WOULD NECESSITATE DISCHARGE OF LARGE NUMBERS OF CHILDREN FROM RETAIL STORES WHERE ON SATURDAY EVENING PARTICULARLY WORK MUST CONTINUE TO A LATER HOUR 5 THAT THE EDUCATIONAL TEST WAS TOO SEVERE EVEN FOR CHILDREN WHO HAD ATTENDED SCHOOL UP TO THEIR FOURTEENTH YEAR 6 THAT THE OFFICE OF THE SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT WOULD BE OVERWHELMED BY THE ADDITIONAL DUTIES IMPOSED UPON HIM OPERATION OF THE ACT IN ORDER TO MEET THE OBJECTIONS LAST NAMED AND THOSE WHICH HAD TO DO WITH THE EDUCATIONAL TEST IT WAS PROVIDED THAT NO PART OF THE ACT SHOULD GO INTO EFFECT UNTIL SEPTEMBER I 90O8 AND THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE EDUCATIONAL TEST SHOULD NOT BE MADE UNTIL SEPTEMBER I I909 OUT OF DEFERENCE TO THE WISHES OF THE EMPLOYERS THE KENTUCKY CHILD LABOR ASSO CIATION CONSENTED TO TWO AMENDMENTS OF THE BILL WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN INTRODUCED THESE AMENDMENTS PERMITTED THE EMPLOYMENT OF CHILDREN BE TWEEN FOURTEEN AND SIXTEEN UNTIL TEN OCLOCK ON SATURDAY NIGHT AND ELIMI NATED THE PENALTY OF IMPRISONMENT THE LEGISLATURE HOWEVER WOULD NOT CONSENT TO THESE AMENDMENTS BUT PASSED THE BILL IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM THE PREDICTIONS OF THE OPPONENTS OF THE BILL HAVE NOT BEEN FULFILLED UNQUESTIONABLY SOME CHILDREN HAVE LOST EMPLOYMENT WHICH THEY WOULD OTHER WISE HAVE RETAINED BUT IN NO CASE WHICH HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION HAS THIS RESULTED IN ANY SERIOUS OR IRREMEDIABLE DISTRESS ON THE OTHER HAND IT CAN SAFELY BE ASSERTED THAT THIS RESULT HAS IN NEARLY EVERY INSTANCE BEEN OF GREAT BENEFIT TO THE CHILDREN HERE AND THERE AN EMPLOYER HAS BEEN FOUND WHO HAS REFUSED TO RETAIN OR EMPLOY ANY CHILDREN UNDER SIXTEEN UPON THE PLEA THAT HE DID NOT WANT TO TAKE ANY CHANCES OR DESIRED TO AVOID THE TROUBLE OF SEEING THAT THE CHILDREN HAD PROPER CERTIFICATES THESE CASES HAVE HOWEVER BEEN VERY FEW THE POINT AT WHICH IT WAS EXPECTED THAT THE EFFECT OF THE ACT WOULD MOST CLEARLY APPEAR WAS IN THE ATTENDANCE ON THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN LOUIS VILLE THE SAME LEGISLATURE WHICH PASSED THE CHILD LABOR BILL ALSO PASSED A NEW COMPULSORY EDUCATION LAW BY WHICH A MORE NUMEROUS CORPS OF TRUANT OFFICERS WAS OBTAINED AND ITS DUTIES MORE CLEARLY DEFINED IT WAS NATURALLY ANTICIPATED THAT THE JOINT OPERATION OF THESE TWO ACTS WOULD BE TO INCREASE THE SCHOOL ATTENDANCE THE FACTS ARE AS FOLLOWS THE SCHOOL CENSUS SHOWS THAT THERE ARE 650OO CHILDREN OF SCHOOL AGE IN LOUISVILLE THAT IS TO SAY CHILDREN BETWEEN SIX AND TWENTY YEARS OF AGE ALL OF WHOM ARE ENTITLED TO ATTEND THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS IF THEY SO DESIRE OF THESE 35680 ARE BETWEEN THE AGES OF SIX AND FOURTEEN AND THEREFORE PRO HIBITED FROM WORKING BY THE NEW LAW A COMPARISON OF THE ENROLLMENT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND THE AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE FOR THE MONTHS OF SEPTEMBER OCTOBER NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER IN THE YEARS 1906 1907 AND I908 IS AS FOLLOWS I75THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY TABLE I ALL SCHOOLS SEPTEMBER ENROLLMENT ATTENDANCE OCTOBER ENROLLMENT ATTENDANCE I 906  26I09  22707  27609   24131 NOVEMBER ENROLLMENT  28199 ATTENDANCE

21165 20978 21307 22038 21963 21504 898 272 798 526 THE FIRST NOTICEABLE THING IN THIS TEDIOUS PARADE OF FIGURES IS THE FALLING OFF IN ENROLLMENT BOTH IN 1907 AND I908 FROM THE 19O6 ENROLLMENT THIS IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE LATE COMMERCIAL UNPLEASANTNESS WHICH BEGAN IN THE FALL OF 1907 IT IS BELIEVED BY THE SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS THAT MANY CHILDREN WERE TAKEN FROM SCHOOL AND PUT TO WORK IN ORDER TO HELP SUPPORT THE FAMILY AT A TIME WHEN THE FATHER OF THE FAMILY WAS EITHER OUT OF EM PLOYMENT OR WORKING AT REDUCED WAGES THE SECOND NOTICEABLE THING IS THAT IN THE COMPARISON BETWEEN 1907 AND 1908 WHEREAS THERE IS A FALLING OFF BOTH IN ENROLLMENT AND ATTENDANCE IN THE HIGH SCHOOLS THERE IS A SLIGHT INCREASE IN ENROLLMENT AND A MARKED INCREASE IN ATTENDANCE IN THE DISTRICT SCHOOLS WHERE OF COURSE THE EFFECT OF THE CHILD LABOR AND TRUANCY LAWS WOULD BE FELT THIS WE THINK MAY FAIRLY BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE JOINT OPERATION OF THESE LAWS THE REPORTS OF THE LABOR INSPECTOR THE TRUANT OFFICERS 176 I9O8 26216 23525 INCREASE 1908 OVER I907 6I 873 128 207 583 605 I31 444REPORTS FROM CHILD LABOR COMMITTEES AND THE AGENTS OF THE CHARITY ORGANIZATIONS AGREE IN STATING THAT THERE ARE VERY FEW CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF FOURTEEN WHO ARE NOT AT SCHOOL THE OFFI CIAL FIGURES DO NOT BEAR THESE STATEMENTS OUT AS TO THESE CHILDREN THE FIGURES ARE AS FOLLOWS TABLE IV CHILDREN BETWEEN SIX AND FOURTEEN SCHOOL CENSUS  35680 ENROLLED IN DISTRICT SCHOOLS  25240 SUBTRACT CHILDREN OVER FOURTEEN IN DISTRICT SCHOOLS  3673 21567 ADD CHILDREN UNDER FOURTEEN IN HIGH SCHOOLS  184 2175I CHILDREN ENROLLED IN PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS  7988 CHILDREN ENROLLED IN PRIVATE SCHOOLS  200 29939 CHILDREN SIX TO FOURTEEN NOT IN SCHOOL  5741 CHILDREN SEVEN TO FOURTEEN NOT IN SCHOOL  4781 THUS THE ENROLLMENT IN ALL SCHOOLS IS ALMOST 6OOO BELOW THE CENSUS THE AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE WOULD FALL MORE THAN 3000 LOWER STILL BUT THIS DOES NOT INDICATE THAT 9000 CHILDREN ARE REGULARLY OUT OF SCHOOL IT WILL BE OBSERVED THAT THE AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE IS FROM EIGHTYFIVE TO EIGHTYEIGHT PER CENT OF THE ENROLLMENT THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS ADVISES US THAT NOT MORE THAN ONESIXTH OF THIS DISCREPANCY IS DUE TO CHRONIC TRUANCY FIVESIXTHS BEING ATTRIBUTABLE TO SICKNESS AND THOSE OTHER DOMESTIC DISORDERS WHICH OCCASIONALLY BRING ABOUT AN ABSENCE OF A DAY OR TWO FROM SCHOOL WE CANNOT VIEW WITH ANY COMPLACENCY THE WORKING OF AN ANTITRUANCY SYSTEM WHICH LETS ESCAPE SEVENTEEN CHILDREN OUT OF EACH ONE HUNDRED WE SHALL MAKE A BETTER REPORT NEXT YEAR ATTENDANCE OF CHILDREN BETWEEN FOURTEEN AND SIXTEEN TO DATE JANUARY 20 I909 THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN LOUISVILLE HAS ISSUED 1508 EMPLOYMENT CERTIFICATES THE SCHOOL CENSUS SHOWS THAT THERE ARE IN LOUISVILLE 8567 CHILDREN BETWEEN THE AGES OF FOURTEEN AND SIXTEEN OF THIS NUMBER 3673 ARE STILL IN THE DISTRICT SCHOOLS AS DIS TINGUISHED FROM THE HIGH SCHOOLS ALTHOUGH THE AVERAGE AGE OF GRADUATION FROM THE EIGHTH GRADE NEXT BELOW THE HIGH SCHOOLS IS THIRTEEN AND ONE HALF YEARS THE ENROLLMENT IN THE HIGH SCHOOLS IS IN ROUND FIGURES 2500 OF WHICH NUMBER I84 ARE UNDER FOURTEEN OF CHILDREN OF THIS AGE THERE ARE ENROLLED IN PAROCHIAL AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS OF THIS CITY ABOUT 500 THIS MAKES THE FOLLOWING SHOWING I77178 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY TABLE V CHILDREN BETWEEN FOURTEEN AND SIXTEEN SCHOOL CENSUS  8567 ENROLLED IN DISTRICT SCHOOLS  3673 ENROLLED IN HIGH SCHOOLS  2332 ENROLLED IN PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS 332 ENROLLED IN PRIVATE SCHOOLS  I6O 6497 CHILDREN BETWEEN FOURTEEN AND SIXTEEN NOT AT SCHOOL 2070 CHILDREN HOLDING EMPLOYMENT CERTIFICATES  I508 562 THIS REMAINDER 562 REPRESENTS THE CHILDREN IN LOUISVILLE BETWEEN FOURTEEN AND SIXTEEN WHO ARE NOT AT SCHOOL AND ARE EITHER LOAFING OR WORKING WITHOUT CERTIFICATES NOW IT IS NOT IN ALL CASES UNLAWFUL FOR A CHILD ALTHOUGH UNDER SIXTEEN TO WORK WITHOUT A CERTIFICATE THE NEW CHILD LABOR ACT SAYS THAT NO CHILD BETWEEN FOURTEEN AND SIXTEEN SHALL WORK IN ANY FACTORY WORKSHOP MINE OR MERCANTILE ESTABLISH MENT WITHOUT A CERTIFICATE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE HAS HELD THAT THIS MEANS THAT IN THE OTHER EMPLOYMENTS PROHIBITED TO CHILDREN UNDER FOURTEEN NO CERTIFICATE IS REQUIRED OF CHILDREN BETWEEN FOURTEEN AND SIXTEEN THOSE OTHER EMPLOYMENTS ARE ANY BUSINESS OFFICE TELEGRAPH OFFICE RESTAURANT HOTEL APARTMENT HOUSE OR THE DISTRIBUTION OR TRANSMISSIONS OF MERCHANDISE OR MESSAGES THIS CIRCUMSTANCE MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY OF THE 562 CHILDREN WHO ARE NOT AT SCHOOL AND DO NOT HOLD CERTIFICATES ARE LOAFING AND HOW MANY ARE WORKING OF THIS NUMBER WE SUPPOSE THAT 200 OR 300 ARE ENGAGED IN EMPLOYMENTS FOR WHICH NO CERTIFICATE IS REQUIRED IF THIS ASSUMPTION IS NOT WIDE OF THE MARK THERE REMAIN 200 OR 300 CHILDREN OF THIS AGE WHO ARE EITHER LOAFING OR WORKING UNLAWFULLY WE SUBMIT THAT THIS IS A BETTER RECORD FOR OUR LABOR INSPECTOR THAN THAT SHOWN BY THE TRUANT OFFICERS HE LEAVES ONLY 200 OR 300 CHILDREN UNACCOUNTED FOR WHEREAS THE TRUANT OFFICERS HAVE ALMOST 6OOO OF WHOM THEY CAN GIVE NO ACCOUNT IT IS OF COURSE PROBABLE THAT SOME OF THOSE 6OOO ARE AT WORK AND THIS MUST OF COURSE BE PUT ON THE DEBIT SIDE OF THE LABOR INSPECTORS ACCOUNT THE CHRISTMAS TRADE THE RUSH OF BUSINESS IN RETAIL STORES WHICH EVERYWHERE CHARACTERIZES THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS BROUGHT OUT IN ITS ACUTEST FORM THE DIFFICULTY WITH REFERENCE TO THE EMPLOYMENT OF CHILDREN AFTER SEVEN OCLOCK IN THE EVENING OUR VERY COMPETENT LABOR INSPECTOR IN VIEW OF THE NEWNESS OF THE REGULA TION AND IN PURSUANCE OF HIS EXCELLENT PLAN OF SECURING A GENERAL ACQUI ESCENCE BY A PROCESS OF FRIENDLY COOPERATION WITH THE EMPLOYERS RATHER THAN BY A RIGOROUS ENFORCEMENT OF PENALTIES TOOK THE POSITION THAT HEREPORTS FROM CHILD LABOR COMMITTEES WOULD NOT INSTITUTE PROSECUTIONS AS HE HAD DONE UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES FOR SLIGHT INFRACTIONS OF THE LAW DURING THE CHRISTMAS RUSH WE HAVE HAD MADE AN INVESTIGATION OF THE CONDUCT OF THE LARGE RETAIL DRY GOODS STORES IN LOUISVILLE DURING CHRISTMAS WEEK FOUR OF THEM EM PLOYED NO CHILDREN UNDER SIXTEEN MORE THAN TEN HOURS A DAY THAT IS TO SAY STRICTLY COMPLIED WITH THE LAW TWO EMPLOYED OLDER GIRLS AND BOYS TO WRAP AND DELIVER BUNDLES AFTER SEVEN OCLOCK TWO OF THESE EM PLOYED OLDER BOYS TO DELIVER BUNDLES AFTER THAT HOUR AND HAD THE WRAPPING DONE BY THEIR REGULAR FORCE OF CLERKS TWO CONCERNS REQUIRED THEIR EM PLOYEES WHO WERE UNDER SIXTEEN TO WORK UNTIL TEN OCLOCK ON EACH OF THE FIVE EVENINGS PRECEDING CHRISTMAS THAT IS TO SAY THEY OPENLY VIOLATED THE LAW ONE OF THESE ESTABLISHMENTS SERVED ITS EMPLOYEES WITH HOT LUNCHES AND SUPPER ON EVERY DAY IN THE HOLIDAY WEEK ONE OF THEM GAVE MEAL TICKETS FOR BOTH LUNCH AND SUPPER ON EVERY DAY IN THAT WEEK ONE OF THEMJ SERVED A SUPPER TO ITS EMPLOYEES ON CHRISTMAS EVE ONE SERVED ITS EM PLOYEES WITH HOT COFFEE EACH EVENING DURING THAT WEEK ONE OF THE TWO WHICH KEPT ITS CHILDREN AT WORK UNTIL TEN OCLOCK MADE NO SUCH PROVISION AT ALL ALL OF THESE STORES DURING CHRISTMAS WEEK ALLOWED THIRTY MINUTES FOR LUNCH AND ONE HOUR FOR SUPPER INVESTIGATION AND RELIEF BEFORE THE KENTUCKY CHILD LABOR ASSOCIATION CAME INTO EXISTENCE AND WHILE THAT LAW WAS IN FORCE WHICH PERMITTED THE COUNTY JUDGE TO ISSUE PERMITS TO CHILDREN UNDER FOURTEEN THE CONSUMERS LEAGUE OF LOUISVILLE HAD ESTABLISHED A SCHOLARSHIP FUND THIS WAS MANAGED IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER ALL APPLICATIONS TO THE COUNTY COURT FOR PERMITS WERE REPORTED TO A COMMITTEE OF THE CONSUMERS LEAGUE AND BY THEM AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE MERIT OF THE APPLICATION WAS UNDERTAKEN IF THE FAMILY TO WHICH THE APPLICANT BELONGED WAS DISCOVERED TO BE WORTHY AND IN GREAT NECESSITY THE CONSUMERS LEAGUE ENTERED INTO AN UNDERTAKING WITH THE COUNTY JUDGE THAT IF HE WOULD REFUSE THE APPLICATION AND SO REQUIRE THE CHILD TO REMAIN IN SCHOOL THE LEAGUE WOULD PAY TO THE CHILDS FAMILY SO LONG AS IT WAS NEEDED A WEEKLY SUM EQUAL TO WHAT THE CHILD WOULD EARN IF AT WORK THIS WORK WAS LATER UNDERTAKEN BY THE KENTUCKY CHILD LABOR ASSOCIATION WHEN THE NEW CHILD LABOR ACT WENT INTO EFFECT IT WIPED OUT THAT LINE OF CLASSIFI CATION ACCORDING TO WHICH THIS AID HAD BEEN GIVEN BECAUSE THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY POWER TO GRANT PERMITS SINCE ALL CHILDREN UNDER FOURTEEN MUST NOW GO TO SCHOOL AND NONE CAN GO TO WORK ALL CASES OF WANT OR DISTRESS FELL INTO A GENERAL CLASS CALLING FOR RELIEF BY THOSE ORGANIZATIONS DEVOTED TO THAT PURPOSE HOWEVER PARTLY THROUGH THE MERE PERSISTENCE OF A HABIT AND PARTLY FROM A SENSE OF OBLIGATION TO SEE THAT THE NEW LAW DID NOT PRODUCE THE DISTRESS WHICH ITS OPPONENTS PREDICTED THE ASSOCIATION HAS CONTINUED THIS WORK DURING THE MONTHS OF OCTOBER NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER 19O8 ITS COMMITTEE ON INVESTIGATION AND RELIEF UPON REPORTS MADE TO IT BY THE TRUANT OFFICERS VISITED IOO HOMES AND MADE A CAREFUL INVESTIGATION OF THE CONDITIONS TO MANY OF THESE CHILDREN SHOES AND 179THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY CLOTHING WERE GIVEN WHICH ENABLED THEM TO GO TO SCHOOL IN SOME CASES SCHOLARSHIPS WERE AWARDED THAT IS TO SAY A WEEKLY PAYMENT OF FROM ONE TO THREE DOLLARS WAS MADE TO THE FAMILY THESE PAYMENTS ARE NOT CONTINUED INDEFINITELY BUT EVERY EFFORT IS MADE TO PUT THE FAMILY IN THE WAY TO BE SELFSUPPORTING SITUATIONS WERE SOMETIMES FOUND FOR OTHER MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY AND IN THE MAJORITY OF SUCH CASES THE SCHOLARSHIP PAYMENTS WERE STOPPED WHEN THE CHILD RECEIVING THE SCHOLARSHIP ATTAINS THE AGE OF FOURTEEN SOME EMPLOYMENT IS FOUND FOR HIM OR HER UNLESS THE CHILD IS ENABLED TO STAY AT SCHOOL BY MEANS OF SOME OTHER PROVISION FOR THE FAMILY THE LARGEST SUM PAID TO ANY ONE CHILD SINCE THIS WORK WAS UNDER TAKEN BY THE ASSOCIATION IS 48OO IT IS NOT EXPECTED THAT THE ASSOCIATION WILL CONTINUE THIS WORK INDEFINITELY BUT IS EXPECTED THAT IT WILL GRADUALLY BE ASSUMED BY OTHER AGENCIES BETTER EQUIPPED BOTH FOR MAKING THE INVESTIGATION AND PROVIDING THE RELIEF OUTLOOK WE ANTICIPATE THAT NEW AND LARGER DIFFICULTIES AWAIT US SO FAR WE HAVE NOT HAD TO DEAL WITH THE RESULTS OF THE APPLICATION OF AN EDUCATIONAL TEST THIS PART OF OUR LAW WILL GO INTO EFFECT ON SEPTEMBER I I909 IT CANNOT CONFIDENTLY BE PREDICTED WHAT ITS EFFECT WILL BE THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS REPORTS AS FOLLOWS WITH REFERENCE TO CERTIFICATES HERE TOFORE ISSUED THE APPLICANTS AS A RULE COME FROM A CLASS THAT SHOULD HAVE MUCH MORE EDUCATION THAN THEY NOW HAVE I HAVE BEEN COMPELLED TO ISSUE CERTI FICATES TO A NUMBER OF APPLICANTS WHO COULD NEITHER READ NOR WRITE MANY MORE HAD GONE NO HIGHER THAN THE THIRD OR FOURTH GRADE IN PUBLIC SCHOOL WORK UNFORTUNATELY THE COMPULSORY ATTENDANCE LAW WILL NOT REACH CHILDREN OF THE AGES COVERED BY THE CHILD LABOR LAW IF IT HAD I SHOULD HAVE COMPELLED MANY CHILDREN TO GO TO SCHOOL TO WHOM I ISSUED CERTIFICATES AND HE ADDS I ANTICIPATE THAT DURING THE NEXT VACATION AND BEFORE SEPTEMBER IST THAT GREAT DIFFICULTY WILL ARISE ABOUT RENEWING A GREAT MANY OF THE CERTIFICATES FOR I AM CONVINCED THAT FULLY ONETHIRD OF THE PERMITS THAT HAVE BEEN GRANTED CANNOT BE REISSUED ON EDUCATIONAL QUALIFICATIONS THE EDUCATIONAL TEST WHICH IT IS THUS ASSERTED COULD NOT BE SATISFIED BY ONETHIRD OF THE CHILDREN TO WHOM CERTIFICATES HAVE BEEN ISSUED REQUIRES THAT THE APPLICANT SHALL BE ABLE TO READ AND WRITE SIMPLE SENTENCES IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND SHALL HAVE RECEIVED INSTRUCTION IN READING SPELLING WRITING AND GEOGRAPHY AND SHALL BE FAMILIAR WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL OPERA TIONS OF ARITHMETIC UP TO AND INCLUDING COMMON FRACTIONS IT APPEARS AT A GLANCE THAT THIS DOES NOT DEMAND A VERY HIGH ORDER OF SCHOLARSHIP THE REQUIREMENT IS MORE THAN SATISFIED BY THE TRAINING RECEIVED BY A CHILD WHO HAS GONE THROUGH THE FIFTH GRADE IN THE LOUISVILLE PUBLIC SCHOOLS A STAGE WHICH THE AVERAGE CHILD REACHES AT THE AGE OF TEN THE AVERAGE OF COM PLETING THE EIGHTH GRADE IN LOUISVILLE NEXT BELOW THE HIGH SCHOOLS IS THIRTEEN OR THIRTEEN AND A HALF AND SUCH CHILDREN HAVE LEARNED NOT ONLY TO READ AND WRITE AND DO THEIR SUMS BUT HAVE COMPLETED THE STUDY OF I8OREPORTS FROM CHILD LABOR COMMITTEES ENGLISH GRAMMAR ARITHMETIC GEOGRAPHY HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES AND OF KENTUCKY AND HAVE HAD SOME INSTRUCTION IN PHYSIOLOGY AND HYGIENE IN MUSIC IN DRAWING AND ONE YEAR OF ALGEBRA OF COURSE MANY OF THESE CHILDREN WILL HAVE REACHED THE AGE OF SIXTEEN WHEN THE EDUCATIONAL TEST BECOMES EFFECTIVE BUT MANY OF THEM WILL NOT HAVE DONE SO AND DOUBTLESS A NEW CROP OF ILLITERATES WILL COME ON TO TAKE THEIR PLACES THIS WOULD NOT BE SO IF THE COMPULSORY EDUCATION LAW WERE STRICTLY ENFORCED IT IS OF COURSE PROBABLE THAT THE APPLICATION OF THIS TEST WILL PRODUCE SOME INCONVENIENCE AND HARDSHIP IF IT DID NOT DO THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY FAIL OF ITS PURPOSE YOU CANNOT GET THE WAGON OUT OF THE OLD RUT WITHOUT ADMINISTERING SOME JOLTS WE HOPE TO JOLT IT JUST ENOUGH TO WAKE UP SOME OF THE OCCUPANTS WITHOUT INFLICTING ANY SERIOUS OR PERMANENT INJURY OUR EXPERIENCE UNDER THE CHILD LABOR ACT HAS BEEN TOO SHORT TO WARRANT ANY EMPHATIC EXPRESSION OF OPINION AS TO ANY FAULTS IN THE LAW WE ARE HOWEVER KEEPING AN EYE ON THESE POINTS I MORE INSPECTORS 2 ASSISTANCE TO THE SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT IN THE LABOR OF

REMAINS TO BE SEEN WE HAVE HAD ONE HEARING WHICH DEVELOPED THE BITTEREST OPPOSITION ANOTHER HEARING WILL BE HELD FEBRUARY I7TH WHEN THE SHOE MAKERS AND WOOLEN MANUFACTURERS ARE TO OPPOSE US THE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMITTEE ARE DOING STRENUOUS WORK IT IS ALL A LABOR OF LOVE WE HAVE NO MONEY EVERYONE PAYS HIS OWN BILLS AND GIVES HIS SERVICES BUT SO FAR WE HAVE HAD PLENTY OF HELP IF WE CAN ONLY

SECURING AND ISSUING LABOR SCHOLARSHIPS THE MINNESOTA COMMITTEE IS IN CORDIAL SYMPATHY WITH THE WORK OF THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE RESOLUTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL ASKING FOR A FEDERAL CHILDRENS BUREAU AND FOR THE OBSERVANCE OF CHILD LABOR DAY HAVE BEEN OFFERED AND IT IS THE AMBITION OF THE LOCAL COMMITTEE TO ATTAIN SUCH STRENGTH AND POWER THAT IT MAY BE WORTHY OF THE RESPONSIBILITY IMPOSED UPON IT BY ITS MEMBERSHIP IN THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE META JACKSON BARNARD SECRETARYTHE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY NEBRASKA CHILD LABOR COMMITTEE UNDER THE OPERATION OF THE CHILD LABOR LAW IN NEBRASKA WITH SUPERIN TENDENTS OF SCHOOLS HANDLING THE ISSUE OF SCHOOLING AND AGE CERTIFICATES WHICH ARE THE PERMITS TO WORK LESS THAN 700 SUCH PERMITS WERE ISSUED UP TO THE CLOSE OF THE SCHOOL YEAR IN I908 THE LAW WENT INTO EFFECT ON MARCH I 1907 MOST OF THESE PERMITS WERE ISSUED IN OMAHA AND SOUTH OMAHA NATURALLY AS THE LARGE ESTABLISHMENTS LIKELY TO EMPLOY CHILDREN ARE LOCATED MOST NUMEROUSLY IN THOSE TWO CITIES LINCOLN FOLLOWED IN NUMBER ISSUED WHILE IN THE STATE OUTSIDE THE PERMITS WERE VERY FEW IN NUMBER THIS CONDITION EXISTS IN NEBRASKA THE ATTORNEYS OF MANY OF THE LARGER FACTOTIES AND OF THE PACKING HOUSES ADVISED AGAINST TAKING ANY CHANCES WITH THE LAW AND AS A CONSEQUENCE SOME BOYS WERE DISCHARGED WHOSE EMPLOY MENT WAS NOT REALLY A VIOLATION OF THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW ONLY IN A FEW CASES COMPARATIVELY WAS STUBBORNNESS EXHIBITED IN CONTINUING TO EMPLOY CHILDREN ILLEGALLY AFTER FAIR WARNING BARRING THE GREEK BOYS WHO ARE FARMED AS SHOE SHINERS COURT PROSECUTION WAS NOT RESORTED TO EXCEPT INCIDENT ALLY WE MET THE GREEKS IN COURT AND THEY VIRTUALLY DEFEATED US THOSE WHO WATCHED THE CASES CAREFULLY BECAME CONVINCED THAT THE GREEK PLAN OF CAM PAIGN HAD BEEN MAPPED OUT BEFORE THE BOYS LEFT THE OLD COUNTRY ON THE FIRST TRIAL SOME OF THEM TALKING OUT OF COURT ADMITTED THEY WERE NOT QUITE FIFTEEN NEXT DAY ON THE STAND THEY WERE ALL SIXTEEN OR OVER AND WHEN THE CASE THREATENED TO BECOME SERIOUS ALL WERE SEVENTEEN OR OVER A GREAT MANY INSISTED THEY HAD COME INTO THE COUNTRY WITH THEIR FATHERS BUT IN A BIG MAJORITY OF THE CASES THE FATHER HAD GONE BACK TO THE OLD COUNTRY THE STATE LABOR COMMISSIONER TOOK PART IN INVESTIGATING AND ATTEMPTING TO PROSECUTE THESE CASES AND A SPECIAL AGENT OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERN MENT ALSO TOOK A HAND BUT THE LATTER SEEMED AS MUCH AT A LOSS HOW TO REACH AND REMEDY THE EVIL AS THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES HOWEVER THE HEARINGS HAD A GOOD EFFECT AT LEAST FOR THE TIME BEING A CONTINUAL EXCUSE OF MERCHANTS WHO NEED MESSENGERS AND BOYS FOR OTHER PURPOSES ABOUT STORES IS THAT WE PERMIT UNDERAGE GREEKS TO WORK BUT WILL NOT ALLOW AMERICAN BOYS TO DO SO UP TO THIS TIME THE PLAN OF HAVING SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENTS ISSUE PERMITS UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE STATE LABOR BUREAU HAS WORKED VERY SATISFAC TORILY THE RETIRING LABOR COMMISSIONER REPORTS THAT HE FOUND IT UNNECESSARY TO ISSUE EVEN ONE PERMIT OVER THE HEADS OF THE SUPERINTENDENTS ALTHOUGH HE DID ADVISE THE ISSUE OF PERHAPS HALF A DOZEN WHERE SUPERINTENDENTS WERE IN DOUBT A PECULIAR AND GRATIFYING DEVELOPMENT OF THE OPERATION OF A GROUP OF CORRELATED LAWS IN NEBRASKA CHILD LABOR LAW COMPULSORY EDUCATION LAW AND JUVENILE COURT LAW HAS BEEN A GREAT LESSENING OF THE COMMITMENTS TO THE REFORM SCHOOLS FOR BOYS AND GIRLS ESPECIALLY THE FORMER THE RETIRING SUPERINTENDENT OF THE NEBRASKA INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL MR SHERMAN HAS RE PORTED THAT THE NUMBER OF BOYS SENT TO THAT INSTITUTION HAS BEEN DECREASING SO STEADILY THAT IF IT CONTINUES THERE WILL BE NO USE FOR AT LEAST ONE OF THE BUILDINGS

THEIR SERVICES IN SMALL RURAL TOWNS THE THIRD EVINCING NO INTEREST AFTER BEING APPOINTED BY GOVERNOR SHELDON AN EFFORT IS TO BE MADE TO HAVE IN SPECTORS LOCATED HEREAFTER IN TOWNS WHERE THEIR SERVICES ARE VERY LIKELY TO BE NEEDED THERE ARE SEVERAL SUCH TOWNS IN THE STATE OUTSIDE OF OMAHA AND LINCOLN ON THE WHOLE IT CAN BE ASSERTED WITHOUT FEAR OF CONTRADICTION THAT NEBRASKA IS QUITE FREE FROM ABUSES OF CHILD LABOR WITH THE POSSIBLE EX CEPTION OF THE MESSENGER SERVICE EMPLOYERS HAVE BEEN COMMENDABLY WILLING TO OBEY THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW THE LAW HERE CAN BE REGARDED AS MAINLY PREVENTIVE A CLOSING OF THE DOOR ON POSSIBLE DANGER IN THE FUTURE JOHN J RYDER SECRETARY NEW YORK CHILD LABOR COMMITTEE THE NEW YORK COMMITTEE HAS HAD A YEAR FULL OF ACTIVITY AND IS PLEASED AT THIS TIME TO REPORT CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS BY FAR THE MOST IM PORTANT GAIN HAS BEEN THE ENACTMENT OF LEGISLATION TO PLACE THE INSPECTION OF DEPARTMENT STORES AND ALL OTHER MERCANTILE ESTABLISHMENTS UNDER A NEW BUREAU ESTABLISHED IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR THIS MARKS THE END OF A TWELVEYEAR STRUGGLE AGAINST POWERFUL MERCANTILE INTERESTS THE CAM PAIGN ATTENDING THE PASSAGE OF THIS MEASURE WAS THE HARDEST FOUGHT SINCE THE RADICAL AMENDMENTS WERE OBTAINED TO THE CHILD LABOR LAWS IN I903 THE CHIEF CREDIT FOR THE VICTORY IS DUE COMMISSIONER OF LABOR HON JOHN WILLIAMS THE NEW YORK COMMITTEE THE NATIONAL CHILD LABOR COMMITTEE AND A NUMBER OF OTHER ORGANIZATIONS WERE UNCEASING IN THEIR SUPPORT OF HIS EFFORTS TO SECURE THE ENACTMENT OF THIS BILL AS BUT THREE MONTHS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE THE NEW MERCANTILE BUREAU WAS ORGANIZED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR IT IS TOO SOON PERHAPS TO JUDGE OF ITS PERMANENT EFFECTIVENESS HOWEVER THE COMMITTEE FEELS AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF WORK HAS ALREADY BEEN ACCOMPLISHED SINCE THE LAW WENT INTO EFFECT OCTOBER IST LAST THIS BUREAU WITH BUT EIGHT INSPECTORS FOR THE THREE LARGEST CITIES OF THE STATENEW YORK BUFFALO AND ROCHESTERMADE AP PROXIMATELY 2100 INSPECTIONS AND FOUND A FEW OVER IOOO CHILDREN WORKING ILLEGALLY DURING THE LAST QUARTER OF I9O08 THIRTYFIVE PROSECUTIONS HAVE BEEN INSTITUTED AGAINST EMPLOYERS VIOLATING THE LAW FROM THESE RESULTS WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT CHILDREN WORKING IN DEPARTMENT STORES SMALL MERCANTILE ES TABLISHMENTS AND FOR TELEGRAPH COMPANIES WILL RECEIVE MUCH GREATER PRO TECTION FROM THE LAW DURING THE COMING YEAR THAN EVER BEFORE THE WORK OF THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR IN ITS INSPECTION OF FACTORIES HAS SHOWN VERY SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS ILLEGAL CHILD LABOR WHICH IN I906 REPRESENTED TWENTYSEVEN PER CENT OF ALL CHILDREN EMPLOYED AND IN I907THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY SEVENTEEN PER CENT DURING 90O8 HAS BEEN STILL FURTHER REDUCED TO THIRTEEN AND EIGHTTENTHS PER CENT FINES AS A RESULT OF PROSECUTIONS BY THIS DEPARTMENT DURING THE YEAR ENDING SEPTEMBER 30 90O8 AMOUNTED TO 4455AN INCREASE OF I745 OVER THE PREVIOUS YEAR AND FOURTEEN TIMES THAT OF I903 THE ISSUANCE OF WORKING PAPERS HAS RECEIVED MORE ATTENTION FROM THE COMMITTEE THAN EVER BEFORE THIS IS EXPLAINED BY THE FACT THAT IN NEW YORK CITY ALONE 23000 CHILDREN RECEIVED EMPLOYMENT CERTIFICATES DURING I908 IN BUFFALO AND ROCHESTER THE NUMBER WAS 2800 AND 1059 RESPECTIVELY AN AGENT PLACED AT THE COMMITTEES EXPENSE IN THE MANHATTAN OFFICE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH NEW YORK CITY WHERE EMPLOYMENT CERTIFICATES ARE ISSUED HAD DONE VERY EFFECTIVE WORK IN HELPING PARENTS FIND SATISFACTORY EVIDENCE OF AGE FOR CHILDREN OTHERWISE UNABLE TO PRESENT SUCH PROOF MORE IMPORTANT HOWEVER HAS BEEN THE OPPORTUNITY THUS AFFORDED THE COMMITTEE TO OBSERVE CONSTANTLY THE LAWS ACTUAL ENFORCEMENT IT HAS ALSO BEEN POSSIBLE THROUGH THIS CHANNEL TO SUGGEST IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENTS TOWARDS MAKING MORE EFFECTIVE THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE LAW A CONCRETE EXAMPLE OF THE WORK DONE MAY BE SEEN FROM THIS ILLUSTRATION IT WAS FOUND THAT MANY CHILDREN WERE UNABLE TO OBTAIN A TRANSCRIPT OF THEIR BIRTH RECORD FROM THE BUREAU OF VITAL STATISTICS ALTHOUGH THEIR PARENTS INSISTED THAT THE BIRTH OF SUCH CHILDREN HAD BEEN PROPERLY REGISTERED IT WAS SUSPECTED THAT THIS WAS DUE TO LACK OF THOROUGHNESS ON THE PART OF THE CLERK WHO EXAMINES THE RECORDS PARTLY THROUGH FAILING TO LOOK UP THE NAME UNDER A SLIGHT VARIATION IN SPELLING OFTEN EXISTING AMONG FOREIGNBORN CHILDREN THE AGENT ACCORDINGLY SECURED THE USE OF A DUPLICATE SET OF THE INDEX BOOKS OF THESE RECORDS AS A RESULT IN A PERIOD OF ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS ENTRIES WERE DISCOVERED OF THE BIRTH OF OVER TWO HUNDRED CHILDREN WHOSE NAMES HAD NOT BEEN FOUND BY THE DEPARTMENT CLERK WITH SUCH EVIDENCE IT WAS A SIMPLE MATTER TO GO TO THE HIGHER OFFICIALS AND TO SECURE BETTER ATTEN TION TO THIS SUBJECT THE PRESENCE IN THE OFFICE OF SUCH AN AGENT HAS BROUGHT ABOUT GREATER REGULARITY IN TESTING THE EDUCATION OF THE CHILDREN BY THE READING AND WRITING TEST PRESCRIBED IN THE LAW SOME IMPROVEMENT IN WATCHING THE PHYSICAL FITNESS OF CHILDREN APPLYING FOR CERTIFICATES IS ANOTHER OUTCOME OF THE PRESENCE OF THIS AGENT THIS KIND OF COOPERATION HAS PROVED SO ACCEPTABLE TO THE OFFICIALS AND THE RESULTS SO SATISFACTORY THAT ANOTHER AGENT HAS RECENTLY BEEN APPOINTED BY THE COMMITTEE TO CARRY ON THE SAME WORK IN BROOKLYN LAST SUMMER THE SECRETARY VISITED THIRTY CITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO OBSERVE THE WORKINGS OF THIS LAW ROCHESTER WAS FOUND TO BE THE ONLY ONE GIVING SERIOUS ATTENTION TO THE PHYSICAL FITNESS OF CHILDREN DESIR ING EMPLOYMENT CERTIFICATES THE INVESTIGATION REVEALED A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF OFFICIALS WHO FAILED USUALLY THROUGH IGNORANCE TO ENFORCE PROPERLY THESE IMPORTANT PROVISIONS THE MOST COMMON IRREGULARITIES NOTED IN THE ISSUANCE OF WORKING PAPERS WERE THE FAILURE TO TEST THE EDUCATION OF CHILDREN BY A READING AND WRITING TEST AND THE ACCEPTANCE OF PARENTS AFFIDAVITS AS SOLE EVIDENCE OF AGE WHEN OTHER PROOF COULD NOT BE PRODUCED MANY OFFICIALS HOWEVER WERE EXERCISING DUE VIGILANCE IN SOME CASES THE WORK WAS BEING CONDUCTED UNDER LAWS THREE AND FOUR YEARS OLD THE AUTHORITIES LEARNING WITH SURPRISE OF RECENT AMENDMENTS AS A RESULT OF THE INVESTIGATION A BETTER COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW IS EXPECTED DURING THE COMING YEAR I88REPORTS FROM CHILD LABOR COMMITTEES IMPROVEMENT IS TO BE RECORDED IN THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAW REGULATING THE SALE OF NEWSPAPERS BY YOUNG BOYS IN CITIES OF THE FIRST AND SECOND CLASS THIS IS PARTICULARLY NOTICEABLE IN NEW YORK ROCHESTER AND TROY WHERE BADGES INDICATING THAT THE HOLDERS ARE LEGALLY LICENSED TO SELL PAPERS ARE BEGINNING TO BE MORE GENERALLY WORN BY NEWSBOYS IN NEW YORK CONSIDER ABLE WAS ACCOMPLISHED DURING THE FIRST TWO WEEKS OF THE PRESENT SCHOOL TERM BY THE ASSIGNMENT OF FIFTY TRUANT OFFICERS TO ENFORCE THIS LAW THE COMMITTEE FEELS THAT THE PRESENT SQUAD OF FOUR MEN PERMANENTLY ASSIGNED TO THIS WORK IS TOO SMALL AND HOPES TO BRING ABOUT AN INCREASE IN THE NEAR FUTURE OUR CHILD LABOR SCHOLARSHIPS ESTABLISHED IN I905 HAVE BEEN CONTINUED THESE ARE FOR THE PURPOSE OF MEETING THE CRITICISM FREQUENTLY HEARDTHAT HARDSHIP WOULD RESULT TO MANY FAMILIES BY CUTTING OFF THROUGH THE LAWS ENFORCEMENT THE CHILDS CONTRIBUTION TO THE FAMILY INCOME LAST YEAR OUT OF 320 APPLICATIONS ONLY 84 SCHOLARSHIPS WERE GRANTED THE BALANCE REPRE SENTED INSTANCES WHERE AFTER A CAREFUL HOME INVESTIGATION THERE APPEARED TO BE NO NEED OF OUTSIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE OR ONES WHICH REQUIRED SPECIAL TREATMENT SUCH AS ADVICE AS TO HOW TO OBTAIN WORKING PAPERS TEMPORARY RELIEF IN THE FORM OF SHOES AND CLOTHING OR HELP TOWARDS SECURING WORK FOR OLDER MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY THE COST OF THIS WORK LAST YEAR WAS AP PROXIMATELY 4000 CONTRIBUTED BY FRIENDS OF THE COMMITTEE AT THE PRESENT SESSION OF THE LEGISLATURE IT IS EXPECTED THAT A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT AMENDMENTS TO EXISTING LAWS WILL BE INTRODUCED WHICH WILL RECEIVE THE SUPPORT OF THE COMMITTEE AMONG THEM WILL BE A BILL TO EXTEND THE FACTORY LAW SO AS TO COVER CLEARLY THE EMPLOYMENT OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN THE SHEDS ADJOINING THE CANNERIES AND ONE WITH REFERENCE TO THE EMPLOY MENT OF CHILDREN IN DANGEROUS OCCUPATIONS THE COMMITTEE HAS NOW IN PROGRESS AN INVESTIGATION OF THE EMPLOYMENT OF BOYS IN BOWLING ALLEYSA PHASE OF CHILD LABOR IN NEW YORK STATE NOT YET COVERED BY LAW AS IN THE PAST YEARS COOPERATION HAS BEEN ACCORDED HEALTH DEPARTMENTS SCHOOLS BOARDS THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND MANY CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS A BEGINNING HAS BEEN MADE TO EXTEND THE WORK OF THE COMMITTEE TO THE LARGER CITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE THROUGH CONFERENCES IN BUFFALO AND ROCHESTER AND BY ADDING TO THE COMMITTEE A REPRESENTATIVE FROM EACH OF THESE CITIES WHILE A LOOK AHEAD REVEALS MUCH REMAINING TO BE DONE THE COMMITTEE FEELS NOT A LITTLE ENCOURAGED OVER CONDITIONS AS THEY NOW EXIST WITH RESPECT TO CHILDREN WHO WORK IN NEW YORK STATE GEORGE A HALL SECRETARY NORTH DAKOTA CHILD LABOR COMMITTEE AT THE CALL OF THE NATIONAL CHILD LABOR COMMITTEE A NUMBER OF GRAND FORKERS MET AT THE HOTEL DACOTAH ON MONDAY EVENING OCTOBER 26 90O8 TO DISCUSS THE FEASIBILITY OF FORMING A CHILD LABOR COMMITTEE IN NORTH DAKOTA IT WAS THE SENSE OF THE MEETING THAT WHILE WE HAVE PRACTICALLY I89THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY NO CHILD LABOR PROBLEM IN THE STATE IT WOULD BE WISE TO GUARD AGAINST A DAY WHEN WE WOULD HAVE ONE AND THAT AS SUCH AN ORGANIZATION WOULD BE OF ASSISTANCE TO THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE WE SHOULD ORGANIZE DR JOHN M GILLETTE WAS CHOSEN PRESIDENT AND ELIZABETH ABBOTT SEC RETARYTREASURER POWER WAS GIVEN TO THE PRESIDENT TO APPOINT A GENERAL COMMITTEE OF THIRTY FROM WHICH COMMITTEE AN EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF SEVEN WAS TO BE APPOINTED TO DATE THERE HAVE BEEN THREE MEETINGS OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE AND ONE OF THE GENERAL THE RESULT IS THAT AT THE PRESENT MEETING OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE A BILL IS TO BE PRESENTED MODELED ON THE BILL RECOMMENDED BY THE NATIONAL CHILD LABOR COMMITTEE ELIZABETH ABBOTT SECRETARY TREASURER OHIO CHILD LABOR COMMITTEE SINCE THE LAST ANNUAL CONVENTION OF THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE THE OHIO COMMITTEE HAS BEEN REORGANIZED AN EXECUTIVE BOARD OF TEN MEMBERS HAVING BEEN APPOINTED TO TAKE CHARGE OF THE COMMITTEES AFFAIRS AND THIS BOARD HAS ALREADY TAKEN UP ACTIVELY THE CONSIDERATION OF THE NEED OF THE CHILD LABOR SITUATION IN THIS STATE BY SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT WITH THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE EVERY RESIDENT OF OHIO WHO CONTRIBUTES FINANCIALLY TO THE NATIONAL CHILD LABOR COMMITTEE BECOMES IPSO FACTO A MEMBER OF THE OHIO CHILD LABOR COMMITTEE WITHOUT ADDITIONAL EXPENSE AND BY AGREEMENT A PORTION OF SUCH CONTRIBUTIONS IS RESERVED FOR THE USE OF THE OHIO COMMITTEE THE NEW OHIO LAW WHICH TOOK EFFECT ON THE FIRST OF LAST JULY IS WORKING SATISFACTORILY AND ITS CONSTITUTIONALITY HAS ALREADY BEEN UPHELD BY THE COMMON PLEAS COURT AND COURT OF APPEALS IN CLEVELAND IN A CASE BROUGHT BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FACTORY INSPECTION FOR VIOLATION OF THE EIGHTHOUR PROVISION THE LEGISLATURE LAST SPRING ALSO PASSED A BILL PROVIDING STATE RELIEF FOR POVERTY STRICKEN FAMILIES TO ENABLE THEM TO KEEP THEIR CHILDREN IN SCHOOL UNTIL THEY ARE QUALIFIED TO GO TO WORK IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE STATE CHILD LABOR LAW THIS LAW PROVIDES THAT A TRUANT OFFICER SHALL REPORT TO THE LOCAL BOARD OF EDUCATION EVERY CASE OF A CHILD OF COMPULSORY SCHOOL AGE WHOSE EARNINGS ARE NEEDED TO SUPPORT EITHER HIMSELF OR OTHERS DEPENDENT UPON HIS EARNINGS AND IT THEN BECOMES THE DUTY OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD TO FURNISH FREE TEXT BOOKS TO THE CHILD AND SUCH OTHER RELIEF TO THE FAMILY AS MAY BE NECESSARY TO ENABLE IT TO KEEP THE CHILD IN SCHOOL THE MONEY FOR SUCH RELIEF IS TO BE PAID OUT OF THE CONTINGENT FUNDS OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THIS PROVISION MAKES THE CHILD LABOR AND COMPULSORY EDUCATION LAWS HARMONIOUS IN THEIR BEARING UPON THE FACTOR OF POVERTY AND MAKES IT UNNECESSARY FOR PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS TO UNDERTAKE THE WORK OF PROVIDING SUCH RELIEF IN THIS STATE IN THE CITY OF CINCINNATI THE BOARD OF EDUCATION HAS ARRANGED WITH THE LOCAL ASSOCIATED CHARITIES TO HAVE SUCH CASES AS ARE REPORTED BY THE TRUANT OFFICERS PROPERLY INVESTIGATED BY THE SOCIAL WORKERS OF THIS ORGANIZATION AND THE RELIEF WILL BE PAID ONLY IN THE EVENT OF ITS BEING RECOMMENDED BY THE ASSOCIATED CHARITIES 190OREPORTS FROM CHILD LABOR COMMITTEES THE STATE LAW DOES NOT PROVIDE PROTECTION FOR CHILDREN ENGAGED IN STREET TRADES EXCEPT FOR MESSENGERS AND DELIVERY BOYS THE NEWSBOYS BOOT BLACKS AND CHILDREN WHO WORK IN THE MARKETS ARE NOT RESTRICTED IN THEIR LABOR EXCEPT IN SO FAR AS THE COMPULSORY EDUCATION LAW APPLIES TO THEM THE EXECUTIVE BOARD OF THE OHIO COMMITTEE IS CONSIDERING THE ADVISABILITY OF REGULATING THE WORK OF CHILDREN IN THE VARIOUS STREET TRADES IN CINCINNATI BY MUNICIPAL ORDINANCE AND HAS DRAFTED A PROPOSED MEASURE WITH THE INTENTION OF URGING THE CITY COUNCIL TO PUT IT IN FORCE ALBERT H FREIBERG CHAIRMAN WARREN OHIO CHILD LABOR LEAGUE THUS FAR THE COMMITTEE HAS CONFINED ITS ATTENTION TO LOCAL CONDITIONS ITS INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE ACTS FOR THE MOST PART THROUGH THE SUPERIN TENDENT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND THE TRUANT OFFICER FEW CASES OF MINORS ILLEGALLY AT WORK HAVE BEEN FOUND THE OFFICIALS THEMSELVES CONSIDER THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS STIMULATED THEM TO GREATER ALERTNESS AND ACTIVITY AND THE EMPLOYER TO A MORE CAREFUL OBSERVANCE OF THE CHILD LABOR LAWS PER HAPS THIS IS THE MOST VALUABLE WORK OF THE COMMITTEE AN EXCELLENT TRUANT OFFICER AND AN EQUALLY EXCELLENT HUMANE OFFICER HAVE USUALLY BEEN ABLE TO SECURE AID FROM THE PROPER AUTHORITIES WITHOUT OUR HELP FOR THE FEW CHILDREN WHO NEED SUCH AID IN ORDER TO REMAIN IN SCTOOL PHEBE T SUTLIFF CHAIRMAN THE REPORT OF THE CHILD LABOR COMMISSION OF THE STATE OF

PURPOSE I TO REQUIRE PROOF THAT CHILDREN ARE FOURTEEN YEARS OLD BEFORE THEY SHALL BE ALLOWED TO WORK 2 TO PLACE THE ISSUANCE OF EMPLOYMENT CERTIFICATES IN THE HANDS OF SCHOOL OFFICIALS 3 TO RAISE THE

LITERATURE HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED SOME IN 30000 QUANTITIES BEARING UPON THE ISSUES OF THE CAMPAIGN THE PROSPECTS ARE ENCOURAGING FOR A BILL WHICH WILL STOP PARENTAL PERJURY AND GIVE SCHOOL OFFICIALS THE ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATES BUT DETERMINED OPPOSITION HAS ALREADY SHOWN ITSELF TO THE TENHOUR DAY AND THE ABOLITION OF NIGHTWORK PROVISIONS IN OUR SECOND BILL ANOTHER COURT DECISIONTHE FOURTH WITHIN FOUR YEARS HAS OVERTHROWN AN ADDITIONAL PART OF THE EXISTING CHILD LABOR LAW THIS HOWEVER ONLY MAKES THE PASSAGE OF OUR BILLS MORE NECESSARY FRED S HALL SECRETARY ALLEGHENY COUNTY PA CHILD LABOR

REGULATION OF CHILD LABOR IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA WAS PASSED BY THE NATIONAL CONGRESS AND APPROVED BY THE PRESIDENT ON MAY 28TH OF LAST YEAR THIS LAW IS THE RESULT OF THREE AND A HALF YEARS EFFORT ON THE PART OF THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE AND OF THE LOCAL COMMITTEE ORGANIZED AT THE SUGGESTION OF THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE THE LAW AS PASSED CONTAINS SOME FEATURES WHICH WERE OPPOSED BY THE FRIENDS OF THE MEASURE BUT WHICH FINALLY HAD TO BE ACCEPTED THE MEASURE WAS PASSED PRACTICALLY IN THE SHAPE RECOMMENDED BY THE NATIONAL AND LOCAL COMMITTEES WITH SEVERAL SECTIONS ADDED WHICH REGULATED STREET TRADING ON THE LINES OF THE NEW YORK LAW A PROVISO WAS INSERTED BY THE SENATE PERMITTING THE JUDGE OF THE JUVENILE COURT TO EXEMPT CHILDREN UNDER THE LIMIT OF FOURTEEN YEARS BUT OVER TWELVE YEARS OF AGE IF THEY WERE THE SUPPORT OF DEPENDENT RELATIVES UNFORTUNATELY THE APPROPRIATION BILL AS PASSED BY CONGRESS CONTAINED NO PROVISION FOR THE INSPECTORS AUTHORIZED BY THE ACT THE COMMISSIONERS OF THE DISTRICT DID THE BEST THEY COULD UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES BY DETAILING TWO POLICEMEN FOR THIS DUTY AND THESE OFFICERS ARE ENGAGED IN FILLING THESE POSITIONS AT THE PRESENT TIME OWING TO THE LACK OF APPROPRIATIONS IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO ANNOUNCE THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAW UNTIL AUGUST FIRST OF LAST YEAR AND EVEN THEN THE FIRST MONTH WAS TAKEN UP IN THE PRELIMINARY WORK OF EXPLAINING THE PROVISIONS OF THE LAW TO DILATORY EMPLOYERS AND PARENTS THE ACTUAL ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAW THEREFORE TOOK PLACE ABOUT THE FIRST OF SEPTEMBER I908 THE FOLLOWING REPORT ON THE EFFECT OF THE LAW REFERS ONLY TO THE FOUR MONTHS ENDING DECEMBER 3IST I908 FOR THIS PERIOD THE MOST IMPORTANT EVENT HAS BEEN THE WORK OF PRO VIDING THE CHILDREN WITH AGE AND SCHOOLING CERTIFICATES THE LAW PROVIDES THAT THESE CERTIFICATES SHALL BE ISSUED BY THE SCHOOL BOARD AND EXPERIENCE SEEMS TO SHOW THAT FOR THIS JURISDICTION THE SCHOOL AUTHORITIES ARE BEST QUALIFIED TO PERFORM THIS DUTY THE AGE OF CHILDREN IS SECURED FOR SCHOOL PURPOSES SOME TIME BEFORE THE QUESTION OF EMPLOYMENT ARISES AND IS THERE FORE LIKELY TO BE REPORTED CORRECTLY BY REQUIRING EACH APPLICANT FOR AN EMPLOYMENT CERTIFICATE TO BRING WITH HIM HIS LAST SCHOOL REPORT THE OFFICIALSTHE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY ARE ENABLED TO SECURE IMMEDIATE INFORMATION ON THE POINT OF EDUCATIONAL QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE GREATER PART OF THE APPLICANTSAPPROXIMATELY NINETY PER CENT OF THE WHOLE NUMBERTHE SCHOOL AUTHORITIES ARE THEREBY IN A POSITION TO DECIDE IMMEDIATELY AS TO THE AGE AND EDUCATIONAL QUALIFICATIONS OF THE CHILDREN SEEKING EMPLOYMENT CERTIFICATES IN ADDITION TO THESE TWO POINTS THE BOARD OF EDUCATION TOOK THE COMMENDABLE ACTION OF DETAILING TWO OF THE SCHOOL MEDICAL INSPECTORS TO THE WORK OF EXAMINING EACH CHILD WHO APPLIED FOR A CERTIFICATE WHILE THE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION WAS NECES SARILY SOMEWHAT RESTRICTED EACH OF THE 3200 CHILDREN WAS EXAMINED AS TO HEART LUNGS SPINAL CURVATURE AND GENERAL PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT ALTHOUGH CERTIFICATES WERE REFUSED ON ACCOUNT OF POOR PHYSIQUE IN BUT FEW CASES A NUMBER OF PROVISIONAL CERTIFICATES WERE ISSUED SUCH AS CERTIFICATES PER MITTING ONLY OUTSIDE WORK IN CASES OF CHILDREN HAVING WEAK LUNGS ETC THE PROBLEM OF SECURING PROPER EVIDENCE OF AGE IN THE CASE OF CHILDREN WHO HAD NOT BEEN RECENTLY IN ATTENDANCE AT THE SCHOOLS HAS PROVED A SOURCE OF CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY IN THE FIRST PLACE REGISTRATION OF BIRTHS IN THIS CITY HAS BEEN STRICTLY ENFORCED ONLY DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS SO THAT THE RECORDS OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH HAVE BEEN OF LITTLE ASSISTANCE IN THE SECOND PLACE FEW OF THE CHILDREN POSSESS BAPTISMAL OR OTHER CHURCH CERTIFICATES CONTAINING INFORMATION AS TO AGE THE RESULT IS THAT FOR THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE CHILDREN NOT POSSESSING SCHOOL RECORDS THE OATH OF THE PARENT OR GUARDIAN AS TO THE AGE OF THE CHILD HAS TO BE ACCEPTED SUCH EVIDENCE IS FRANKLY CONCEDED BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIALS TO BE OF LITTLE VALUE BUT IN SUCH CASES THE ONLY COURSE OPEN HAS BEEN FOLLOWEDNAMELY TO EMPHASIZE THE EDUCATIONAL TEST AND THE EXAMINATION BY THE SCHOOL PHYSICIAN THE EFFECT OF THE EXEMPTION CLAUSE IN THE LAW WHICH REDUCED THE AGE LIMIT FROM FOURTEEN TO TWELVE IN CASES OF POVERTY HAS BEEN OBSERVED WITH ESPECIAL INTEREST BECAUSE THE CENSUS OF I900 SHOWED THAT APPROXIMATELY ONETHIRD OF THE CHILD BREADWINNERS OF THIS CITY WERE ORPHANS THE POWER TO MAKE EXEMPTIONS IS VESTED IN THE JUVENILE COURT THE HEAD OF THAT COURT HAS SHOWN A FULL APPRECIATION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS PHASE OF THE PROBLEM AND HAS GRANTED SUCH EXEMPTIONS ONLY AFTER THE NEED OF THE CHILDS EARNINGS HAS BEEN CLEARLY ESTABLISHED IN VIEW OF THIS FACT IT MAY BE SAID THAT THE HARM OF THE EXEMPTION CLAUSE HAS BEEN RESTRICTED TO A MINIMUM THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN UNDER SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE WHO HAVE RECEIVED EMPLOYMENT CERTIFICATES IS AS FOLLOWS STREET TRADING CERTIFICATES I700 GENERAL EMPLOYMENT CERTIFICATES 1478 THE WORKING CHILDREN ACCORDING TO THESE FIGURES CONSTITUTE APPROXIMATELY ONE PER CENT OF THE TOTAL POPULATION AND APPROXIMATELY TEN PER CENT OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CHILDREN UNDER SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE HENRY J HARRIS SECRETARY I94REPORTS FROM CHILD LABOR COMMITTEES WISCONSIN CHILD LABOR COMMITTEE WISCONSIN CHILD LABOR CONDITIONS ARE NOT MATERIALLY CHANGED SINCE RE PORTED UPON IN THE SPRING OF I908 THE BIENNIAL SESSION OF THE WISCONSIN LEGISLATURE IS JUST BEGINNING AND SEVERAL AMENDMENTS WILL BE OFFERED TO THE CHILD LABOR LAW AS AMENDED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF 1907 IT HAS BEEN A CUSTOM IN WISCONSIN AND WE THINK A WISE CUSTOM TO ALLOW A CHILD LABOR LAW WHEN RADICALLY AMENDED TO BE TESTED FOR FOUR YEARS WITHOUT IMPORTANT AMENDMENTS BY THE INTERVENING LEGISLATURE THAT THE LAW MAY BE GIVEN A CHANCE TO DEMONSTRATE ITS USEFUL NESS AND ITS WEAK POINTS THAT PLAN WILL BE FOLLOWED THIS YEAR AND IT IS HOPED THAT THERE MAY BE AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE EDUCATIONAL TEST BY A RE QUIREMENT OF A TEACHERS CERTIFICATE AT PRESENT THE BURDEN IS THROWN UPON THE OFFICERS GRANTING THE PERMIT TO TEST THE CHILDS KNOWLEDGE OF ENGLISH THIS IS WRONG IN PRINCIPLE AND WORKS OUT INCONVENIENTLY IN PRACTICE THE FACTORY INSPECTORS OFFICE UPON WHICH MUCH OF THE WORK OF GRANTING PERMITS FALLS REQUESTS THAT A TEACHERS CERTIFICATE AS TO EDUCATION SHOULD BE REQUIRED BE FORE PERMIT IS GIVEN IT IS HOPED THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL IMPROVE THE LAW IN VARIOUS MINOR BUT IMPORTANT DETAILS VERY LITTLE HARM HAS APPARENTLY RESULTED UNDER THE PERISHABLE GOODS CLAUSE ON WHICH REPORT WAS MADE IN I908 BECAUSE OF A STRICT CONSTRUCTION OF THE ACT BY THE ATTORNEY GENERALS DEPARTMENT AND PERHAPS BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN MANY PROSECUTIONS BUT THE CLAUSE IS THOROUGHLY BAD IN PRINCIPLE AND CONDEMNED BY EXPERIENCE IN OTHER STATES WE HOPE THAT IT WILL BE STRUCK OUT OF THE LAW THIS WINTER AS TO THE FIFTYFIVE HOUR CLAUSE THE TESTIMONY OF THOSE WHO KNOW IS THAT IT IS WORKING WELL AND THAT ON THE WHOLE IT IS BEING FAITHFULLY OBEYED AND THAT IT IS NOT RESULTING AS IT HAS IN SOME OTHER STATES IN CHILDREN WOIRKING SIXTY HOURS A WEEK INSTEAD OF FIFTYFIVE WE TRUST THE TIME WILL COME AND SPEEDILY WHEN WISCONSIN CAN HAVE A NINE HOUR DAY THERE IS INCREASING DISSATISFACTION FELT WITH THE EXEMPTION OF NEWS BOYS FROM THE GENERAL OPERATION OF THE CHILD LABOR LAW AND A GROWING FEELING THAT THERE SHOULD BE A SPECIAL NEWSBOYS AND STREET TRADES ACT ALONG THE LINE OF THE ACTS IN NEW YORK AND MASSACHUSETTS IT IS HOPED THAT A LAW OF THIS KIND MAY BE PASSED AT THE PRESENT SESSION OF THE LEGISLATURE UNDER THE WISCONSIN LAW OF 1907 THE NUMBER OF PERMITS ISSUED TO CHILDREN UNDER SIXTEEN HAS BEEN REDUCED TO ABOUT THIRTYFIVE PER CENT THIS IS A STRIKING FEATURE IN VIEW OF THE GREAT DEMAND FOR CHILDRENS WORK IN ADDITION TO THE POSSIBLE REDUCTION OF CHILD LABOR BECAUSE OF THE FINANCIAL STRINGENCY NOT ALWAYS OPERATING LARGELY TO REDUCE CHILD LABOR THE REDUC TION IN THE NUMBER OF PERMITS ISSUED RESULTS FROM THE DANGEROUS EMPLOY MENT CLAUSE OF THE LAW OF I907 WHICH WE BELIEVE TO BE ONE OF THE MOST THOROUGH AND COMPLETE OF ITS KIND IN THE UNITED STATES AND BECAUSE OF THE INCREASING STRICTNESS IN ISSUING PERMITS ESPECIALLY IN THE FACTORY INSPECTORS OFFICE WHERE PROBABLY MUCH MORE THAN HALF OF THE PERMITS OF THE STATE ARE ISSUED THE MOST STRIKING RECENT FEATURE OF THE CHILD LABOR SITUATION IN WISCON I95THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY SIN IS THE INCREASING DEMAND FOR YOUNG GIRLS WORK IN FACTORIES INCLUDING TANNERIES AND THERE ARE MANY INSTANCES REPORTED WHERE MEN HAVE BEEN RE PLACED BY GIRLS AND OFTEN BY GIRLS BETWEEN FOURTEEN AND SIXTEEN WE HAVE GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO THE DEMAND FOR GIRLS IN HOUSEHOLD WORK AND THE FACT THAT IT WAS HARD TO FILL THAT DEMAND BUT IT IS A NEWER FEATURE OF THE SITUATION TO HAVE A DEMAND FOR YOUNG GIRLS IN FACTORIES WHICH IS IN EXCESS OF THE SUPPLY THE FACTORY INSPECTORS OFFICE ASKS FOR TWO MORE ASSISTANT FACTORY IN SPECTORS AND THEY SEEM TO BE THOROUGHLY NEEDED IN CLOSING IT SHOULD BE SAID THAT THE CAUSE OF CHILD LABOR IN WISCONSIN IS GREATLY HELPED ESPECIALLY IN MILWAUKEE COUNTY BY THE INCREASING EFFICIENCY OF THE WORK OF THE PROBATION OFFICERS IN THE JUVENILE COURT AND BY THE MOST HELPFUL WORK OF THE TRUANCY DEPARTMENT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN THAT THE BEST RESULTS CAN ONLY BE OBTAINED WHEN CHILD LABOR JUVENILE COURT AND COMPULSORY EDUCATION LAWS ARE KEPT AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE AT AN EQUAL STATE OF EFFICIENCY SO THAT EACH MAY HELP THE OTHER IN HANDLING ITS PECULIAR PROBLEMS EDWARD W FROST CHAIRMAN REPORTS FROM THE SOUTHERN STATES VIRGINIA THE AGE LIMIT FOR THE EMPLOYMENT OF

TO SIXTEEN AND THE PROVISION FOR A FACTORY INSPECTOR UNDER THE BUREAU OF LABOR A BILL HAS BEEN INTRO DUCED BY REPRESENTATIVE J W HINSDALE OF RALEIGH GOING FARTHER THAN THESE PROPOSALS IN THE LINE OF CHILD LABOR REFORM BUT THE RESULT IS PROBLEM ATICAL I NOTE THAT THE COMMITTEE OF MANUFACTURES AND LABOR OF THE SENATE IS COMPOSED MAINLY OF COTTON MILL OWNERS AND ANY BILL THAT GETS THROUGH THE SENATE MUST BE PASSED IN SPITE OF AN UNFAVORABLE REPORT FROM THIS COMMITTEE OR MUST BE SUBJECTED TO THEIR TENDER MERCIES BY WAY OF AMENDMENT A LARGE LOBBY OF FIFTY MANUFACTURERS IS URGING IN RALEIGH THE DEFEAT OF THE HINSDALE BILL NEVERTHELESS SOME ADVANCE MAY BE GAINED AT PRESENT THE COMMISSIONER OF LABOR HAS NO AUTHORITY TO ENTER A FACTORY FOR INSPECTION THOUGH IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT THE NEW COMMISSIONER WILL DO SOMETHING MORE FOR THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE CHILD LABOR LAW THAN HIS PREDE CESSOR DID I96REPORTS FROM CHILD LABOR COMMITTEES SOUTH CAROLINA THE SOUTH CAROLINA LEGISLATURE IS ALSO IN SESSION ONE OR MORE AMEND MENTS HAVE BEEN OFFERED TO THE CHILD LABOR BILL AND A COMPULSORY SCHOOL ATTENDANCE BILL HAS ALSO BEEN INTRODUCED AS ALREADY NOTED THE COTTON MANU FACTURERS HAVE SAID THEY WILL NOT OBJECT TO THE RAISING OF THE AGE LIMIT TO FOURTEEN IF THE COMPULSORY ATTENDANCE BILL IS PASSED BUT I HAVE HEARD OF NO GREAT ACTIVITY FOR THE PASSAGE OF THE LATTER MEASURE WHICH THEY CLAIM TO HAVE BEEN FAVORING FOR YEARS I UNDERSTAND THAT AN AMENDMENT FORBIDDING NIGHT WORK FOR CHILDREN UNDER SIXTEEN WILL NOT BE OBJECTED TO AS THERE IS VERY LITTLE NIGHT WORK IN SOUTH CAROLINA I HAVE DESCRIBED ELSEWHERE1 HOW FLAGRANTLY THE PRESENT CHILD LABOR LAWS ARE BEING VIOLATED IN BOTH THE CAROLINAS WITHOUT FACTORY INSPECTION GOVERNOR ANSEL IN SOUTH CAROLINA AS DID RETIRINGGOVERNOR GLENN AND GOVERNOR KITCHIN IN NORTH CAROLINA ADVO CATED THE INITIATION OF A FACTORY INSPECTION SYSTEM IN THEIR MESSAGES TO THE LEGISLATURE FLORIDA THE FLORIDA LEGISLATURE MEETS IN MARCH PREPARATIONS ARE BEING MADE BY THE LABOR UNIONS THE WOMENS CLUBS AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS STANDING FOR THE CAUSE OF THE WORKING CHILDREN TO RAISE THE AGE LIMIT IN FLORIDA FROM TWELVE TO FOURTEEN AND TO MAKE THE LAW MORE EFFECTIVE IN OTHER WAYS TENNESSEE THE PRINCIPAL NEED NOW FELT IN TENNESSEE IS GREATER AUTHORITY FOR THE FACTORY INSPECTOR AND BETTER PROVISIONS OF LAW RELATING TO SANITARY AND SAFETY APPLIANCES THESE MEASURES WHICH I UNDERSTAND ARE ALREADY BEING ADVO CATED BY THE LABOR UNIONS ARE TO BE PRESSED TO A CONCLUSION WITH THE HELP OF THE TENNESSEE CHILD LABOR COMMITTEE THE LEGISLATURE IS NOW IN SESSION GEORGIA THE GEORGIA LEGISLATURE MEETS IN JUNE THE GEORGIA CHILD LABOR COMMITTEE HAS BEEN CONTENDING FOR SOME TIME FOR THE SIXTY HOUR WEEK THE REPEAL OF THE EXEMPTION CLAUSE OF THE PRESENT CHILD LABOR LAW AND THE INAUGURATION OF FACTORY INSPECTION IT IS HOPED THAT THESE EFFORTS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL AT THE APPROACHING SESSION OF THE LEGISLATURE ALABAMA IN ALABAMA WE HAVE ONLY TO NOTE THAT THE RECENT LAW HAS NOT BEEN ENFORCED OWING PARTLY TO THE LONG ILLNESS FOLLOWED BY DEATH OF THE FACTORY INSPECTOR DR SHIRLEY BRAGG HIS SUCCESSOR HAS RECENTLY BEEN APPOINTED DR THOMAS G BUSH AND A NEW CHIEF MINE INSPECTOR EDWARD FLYNN IT IS HOPED THAT THE NEW FORCE WILL BE ABLE TO CARRY OUT THE PROVISIONS OF THE INSPECTION LAW AND THAT THERE WILL RESULT A MORE CAREFUL OBSERVANCE OF THE CHILD LABOR LAW 1 SEE PP 6372 I97THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY MISSISSIPPI ONE OF THE AMUSING THINGS ABOUT THE MISSISSIPPI SITUATION IS THE ATTITUDE OF THE MANUFACTURERS OVER THE PASSAGE OF WHAT THEY CALL THE DRASTIC LAW FORBIDDING CHILDREN UNDER TWELVE TO WORK IN FACTORIES AND CHILDREN UNDER SIXTEEN TO WORK MORE THAN FIFTYSIX HOURS A WEEK OR MORE THAN TEN HOURS A DAY AT FIRST THEY WENT INTO THE NEWSPAPERS WITH THE THREAT TO DISCHARGE ALL THEIR EMPLOYEES UNDER SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE BUT AS IT HAD ALREADY BEEN ASCERTAINED THAT TWENTYFIVE PER CENT OF THE EMPLOYEES WERE UNDER FOURTEEN THIS PROPOSITION WAS RECONSIDERED SO THE EXPEDIENT HAS BEEN ADOPTED OF KEEPING THE ACTUAL TIME AT WHICH THE DOFFER BOYS ARE AT WORK AND LETTING THE GIRL SPINNERS COME AN HOUR LATER IN THE MORNING OR LEAVE AN HOUR EARLIER

examination of the ana tomy of the various forms preserved afforded opportunity for morphological notes of inter est especially those bearing on the relations of Modiolarca Phtlobrya etc The cephalopods were represented only by beaks of cuttlefish found in the stomachs of seals and penguins more or less demoralized by digestive fluids and incapable of identification These brief indications will show how much this series of memoirs is liliely to add to our knowledge of the Antarctic regions and how much science is indebted to the intrepidity of the explorers and observers on

decided that a similar meeting should be held in 1905 and Professor Munsterbergs invitation to the psychological laboratory of Harvard University was gratefully accepted with the understanding that the meeting should be transferred to Clark University in case of any interference with Professor Munsterbergs plans PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON THE 582d meeting was held March 12 1904 Dr A F Zahm continued his paper begun at the previous Ineeting discussing several specific problems in aerodynamics in the light of the constants he had determined experi mentally he pointed out that some of the forms of flying machines of noted experi menters had an excessive amount of skin friction and showed some of the conditions of maximum efficiency in such machines Btr G K Gilbert spoke on  The Beasibility of Measuring Tides and Currents at Sea This problem appeals to the geologist as well as to the hydrographer It was suggested that a hollow vessel might be anchored at some distance below the surface of the sea con taining a registering pressure gauge on which the superincumbent column of water acted Various forms of gauges were discussed as to their range sensibility and adaptability CHARLES K WEAD Secretary THE ACADEMY OF SCIENaE OF ST LOUIS AT the meeting of the Academy held on AIarch 2t Professor W L Eikenberry de livered a lecture on the  Principles of Ecology and the Development of Plant Societies IIe showed that the science of botany had been greatly advanced by the study of plant ecology or plantso4ciology z e by the study of plants in their external relations to each other and the adjustment of plants and their organs to their physical surroundings For merly taxonomy or the determiningb of a plants position in a scheme of classification was the aim of all students and teachers Now the study of botany is pursued on a broader scale plants being studied as living things which are not scattered at haphazard over the globe but are organized into definite com munities determined by the conditions under which certain plants can live Ecology since it considers plants and their environments takes the student directly into the field instead of confining him to herbarium specimens Systematic botany while very essential should always be made one of the means and not the final end of botanical study By a series of lantern slides Professor Eiken berry showed the transition from a pond so ciety to a swampforest First we have a lily pond with sedges at the margin of the water As the lilypond loses its water the sedges and swampgrasses crowd in This swampmoor is followed by shrubs and finally by a swamp forest such as tamarack pine and hemlock Professor Eikenberry also traced the develop ments of plant societies adapted to dry air and soil Various plants such as lichens mosses and small crevice plants are able to live upon bare rocks As these exposed rocks are weathered away the crevices become larger and seeds of small plants find lodgment there As time goes on the fissures increase in size more soil is formed and shrubs and finally trees root there resulting ultimately in forests CLEMSON COLLEGE SCIENaE CLUB AT the regular monthly meeting held Feb ruary 26 1904 Dr H Metcalf presented a paper entitled  A Contribution to Culture Xlethods The speaker gave a description and exhibition of special apparatus for cul tural nTork in llant pathology as published in the Jotrnal of Anpplted Mtcroscopy for Sep tember 1903 This was preceded by a dem onstration of various bacterial and fungus colonies through the projecting microscope Professor P T Brodie gave a paper entitled  Engineering Features of the Isthmian Canal The speaker discussed his subject under thesclENas 661 APR1L 22 1904 following topics 1  Brief history of the Isthmian Canal problem with special refer ence to the Nicaragua Panama and San Blas routes 2 comparative advantages of the canals at Nicaragua and Panama 3 gen eral description of plans for Panama Canal as made by the government commission and now adopted by provisions of treaty with the Re public of Panama and a comparison of this with the sealevel canal of de Lesseps and other plans by the French companies 4 a discussion of the engineeringdifficulties in volved at Culebra cut and the iE3ohio dam S The iE3ohio Lake and the Gigaganti Spill way for the control of the summit level and the floods of the Chagris River 6 a com parison of the advantages of a lock canal at Panama with those of a sealevel canal at Mandingo involving a tunnel lhrough the continental divide The lecture was illus trated with forty lantern slides prepared from drawings and photographs F S SEIIVER Secrefary CIEMSON COLLEGE S a MarEh 1904  DISCUESION AND CORRESPONDENCD TIIE UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI AND ITS PRESIDENCY THE history of the University of Cincinnati for the last Sve years has without doubt a most important bearing upon the principles o university government This is due to the features of its early organization and to the peculiar relations which it sustains to the com munity The original endowment of a free college for white children  by Charles Mc Micken ill 1858 the incorporation of the University of Cincinnati by act of legislature in 18t4 with McMicken College as an integral part of it the issue of city bonds for con struction and the levying of a tax for the partial support of the institution were the acts that gave a free university to Cincinnati A municipal university distinctly anoma lous among AInerican universities had to be provided with a mechanism of government This was arranged for by the statute which created a board of directors of nine teen members including the mayor of the city ex ofFcio Originally twelve of these mem bers were appointed by the superior court and sis were selected by the board of educa tion but in 1892 the law was so amended that the superior courtXappointed the entire board thus taking it out of politics Theboard had and still has control oE the funds and of the faculty of the academic department alone which for a number of years was the only department of the institution actively organ ized and in working condition In the beginning the board of directors invested the dean of the faculty with ex ecutive functions but in 18t7 it elected Rev Thomas V7ickers rector This arrange ment lasted until 1884 when aher a long and sensational  investigation  the executive ofEce again became vacant An interregnum ensued until 188S when General Jacob D Cox then and for sozne years before and after dean of the Cincinnati Law School became president His incumbency lasted until 1888 These two experiences and the dearth of funds prompted the board of directors to revert to the old policy of having the dean of the academic ac ulty exercise the executive functions in that department and to provide furthermore that members of the faculty in the order of senior ity should serve as dean each one to serve for a year In 188Y the board of directors prompted by a desire to expand the institution to the pro portions of a real university affiliated certain local professional schools namely the Cincin nati Law School the Medical College of Ohio the Miami Medical College and the Ohio Den tal College SEach of the affiliated institutions was only nominally a department of the uni versity since each maintained its autonomy its own governing body andt acted under its own charter In 1892 the relations with the two medical schools were terminated but the Medical Col lege of Ohio in 1896 by surrendering its char ter to the university became the medical de partment still however with many rights reserved viz the right to nominate all the members of its faculty the control of its funds and of its internal management

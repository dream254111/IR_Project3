j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1010709,Diagnosis of the Worlds Elastic Currency Problems,i242588,DIAGNOSIS OF THE WORLDS ELASTIC CURRENCY PROBLEMS BY ANDREW J FRAME President Waukesha National Bank Waukesha Wisconsin Professor Sumner in his History of American Currency said in summing up the doctrines of the celebrated bullion report which was submitted to the House of Commons in 18io Its doctrines are the alphabet of modern finance They are no longer disputable Another section reads In the presence of a panic the duty of the bank is to discount freely to all solvent parties I take it a smile will pass over the features of my banker friends the moment their neertobeforgotten practical experiences of 1893 and 1907 loom up as a nightmare before them again How can a bank discount freely to all solvent parties when its panicstricken depositors want all the cash the bank holds and very quickly too What is the meaning of the word panic The Standard Dic tionary says The prevalence of unreasoning and overpowering alarm in financial and commercial circles or in both leading to sudden and stringent restrictions of credit and great shrinkage in values and precipitating mercantile and banking failures often the precursor of a financial panic Panics undoubtedly cannot be wholly prevented except in theory by such dreamers as Bellamy who support the impossible idea that human nature can be changed speculation cease and opti mism be eradicated from AngloSaxonism Notwithstanding this I am a firm believer in ameliorating panic conditions both as to their frequency and as to their severity But how My answer is I By studying history and profiting by the experiences of the past 2 By passing conservative and sound banking laws and then enforcing them 3 By giving as much elasticity to the circulating medium as can be safely attained but never to reach an amount which engenders 37778 The Annals of the American Academy doubt in the public mind as to its redemption in the worlds standard of value As to the problem of conservative and sound banking laws and enforcement the national banking system is the safest and best this country has known It is a wellknown fact that some states have good laws some lax laws and others none at all It is also a matter of gratification to know that many states are working along the line of betterment With thirteen thousand million dollars due to not less than sixteen million depositors in the banks and trust companies of the United States in order that conditions leading to panics and their paralyzing effects may be minirffized is it not the clear duty of our statesmen to perfect as far as possible conservative laws on sound lines  These laws should demand ample capital paid in limitations on loans to any person or firm and reasonable reserves according to whether deposits are payable on demand or on time As space forbids further pursuit of this phase of the subject I will confine myself to the knotty elasticity problem The Elasticity Problem The history of the progress of nations during the earlier cen turies shows an evolution from the use of bullocks as a medium of exchange as recorded in the Bible to the later period of barter by the use of beads nails skins shells etc In later centuries in addition to the limited quantities of coin the banks have indulged more or less in the issue of socalled asset or credit currency dubbed coined credit by Professor Sumner as well as cur rency secured by various kinds of collateral All makeshifts have in the most advanced and progressive nations given way to the worlds standard of valuegold until today those progressive nations which issue currency do so largely through one great cen tral bank The immense coin reserves of these great banks prac tically make their currency issues a gold certificate payable on demand They are practically banks of issue and not of deposit as will be seen by the table which follows These banks issue more or less currency in excess of coin held but some are based on gov ernment securities as in England all their loans are amply secured and of a quick liquid character In view of these facts these great banks with immense capital coin reserves and small liabilities 378Diagnosis of Worlds Elastic Currency Problems 79 are in a position to expand currency issues to move crops without distrust and under panic conditions to discount freely to all solvent parties also to furnish extra cash to banks with which to meet the insane demands of frightened depositors thus pre venting general paralysis of trade and industry in all branches which is inevitable if forced liquidation takes place which is so destructive to labor and capital alike I am firmly convinced that if the United States had lately had a large central bank of the banks commensurate with our greatness notwithstanding the colossal pyramid of credit which we have been building we might have been let down by easy stages instead of falling off from the top of the building producing a jar that seems to have shaken the whole commercial world I am also convinced that if the last Congress had authorized asset or credit currency on the American Bankers Association plan when the 1907 spasm struck us our troubles would simply have doubled Let us briefly diagnose the reasons therefor by a comparison of European conditions with those of the United States as they exist today Capital specie circulation etc of the great European single banks of issue on or about June 30 90o6 TABLE NO I In

hold 54 per cent of demand liabilities in coin as against only 7 per cent in the United States Mark that as records show the total currency issues by all the other great European banks of deposit on June 30 1906 ap proximated but 150 millions of dollars and when the charters of the four German banks and those of Great Britain and Switzerland expire the right to issue currency by all of them being doomed there will be few left in Europe to issue currency except these twenty great centralized banks and the new bank of Switzerland Do not the foregoing facts conclusively show that the progressive European nations each have one great issuing bank which might be termed the governor to the engine expanding and contracting automatically without distrust because they have immense coin reserves and quick assets and that the issue of credit or any other kind of currency by small independent banks has practically been totally abolished all over Europe This result in Europe was evidently brought about through the dear school of experience Let us touch upon a few most salient instances abroad 380Diagnosis of Worlds Elastic Currency Problems 81 France John Law nearly 200 years ago after being turned down by the keen Scotchmen captured the French people with his plausible populistic inflation scheme and history tells us that France did not recover from its terrible effects for fifty years The statesmen of France not content with the John Law experiment in conse quence of business depression in 1789 instead of manfully waiting for a natural return of better days in response to the popular clamor for more money sought to take a short cut to prosperity by issuing heroic quack doses of fiat money for several years in succession Just as soon as the effects of the first issues began to show symptoms of a reaction upon business another larger dose was administered to the already staggering patient The statesmen of France in most eloquent perorationswhich might be likened to some in these latter daysswayed the multi tude so far that the intoxication for assignats grew until nearly 40000 millions of francs were outstanding in 1797 a sum aggre gating nearly three times our whole circulating medium today With one fell swoop the French nation repudiated the whole issue The Bank of France was organized in 18oo with about 6ooo ooo capital which at various times was increased until today it is about 35000000 It has power to issue notes with the fol lowing prerequisites as dictated by Napoleon The notes shall be covered either by coin held by the baik or by notes secured by collateral or by notes signed by three responsible persons A strong effort was made at that time to give the right of issue to the banks generally in France but Napoleon answered in sub stanceIt is easier to watch one bank of issue than it is to watch great numbers His logic exactly condemns the American Bankers Association plan today What has been the result in France The foregoing table shows Millions Circulation  9088 Coin on hand is 88V2 per cent of circulation 8034 If we add the deposits of   1891 to circulation outstanding the bank still would show about 73 per cent of coin against all liabilities as against 7 per cent for the national banks of the United States We must not forget also that the 2553 millions of loans are of a much more liquid character 38182 The Annals of the American Academy than are those of the national banks generally throughout the United States The Bank of France has been managed with such consummate skill that even during the FrancoGerman war the depreciation of its notes was only 4 per cent It also during the past century ren dered invaluable aid by loaning coin to the Bank of England during several crises in Britain The bank with its vast coin reserves and quick assets has been enabled to loan freely to all solvent parties under panic conditions thus undoubtedly preventing panics at times and it has steadied the financial convulsions in France for a century The Bank of France has had the sole right of issue in France since 1848 Its uncovered currency averages about I20 million dollars which indicates no currency inflation in France as against 9oo millions in the United States today England The Bank of England was chartered in 1694 Although it was of great value to mercantile interests in several financial crises yet as the bank had limitless authority to issue notes and there was no rule as to coin reserves from 1694 to 1844 at which date Peels Act gave the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street the straight jacket she has worn ever since Bagehot in his classic work entitled Lombard Street says This unbridled authority was in more than one instance used withthe extremest unwisdom so that devastating panics followed hard upon the heels of the reck less speculation which too great facilities for borrowing had engen dered Such dearlybought experiences ought to warn us against easy methods of inflation English statesmen battled for a quarter of a century with the subject of whether gold was at a premium or a redundant quantity of Bank of England notes at a discount The question was finally settled in 1816 by the adoption of the pro found Bullion Report of I8Io The integrity of her gold stan dard of payments has since been maintained with a fidelity that commands the admiration and confidence of the whole world to the extent that London is the worlds clearing house and practi cally all the nations of the earth pay tribute to Britain The para mount question to us is how soon will New York City displace London as the worlds clearing house if we keep on injecting more nonstandard currency into our already redundant currency issues 382Diagnosis of Worlds Elastic Currency Problems 83 Under Peels Act the banks of Great Britain in 1844 were restricted on issues of bank notes to the amount then outstanding by the banks then existing Seventy per cent of the right of issue of those banks which have closed since 1844 has reverted to the Bank of England thus reducing the total uncovered issues allowed to banks in general all of which are subject to the unlimited liability act as to note issues to the small sum of approximately 8oooooo and has increased the issues of the Bank of England since 1844 from 14oooooo to about I8I75ooo based on securi ties All other issues of the bank are covered with gold coin or bullion thus making the notes practically gold certificates and giv ing the Bank of England the sole right of issue in Britain The total uncovered issues in Britain average about 120oooooo of which 90000oooooo are Bank of England notes based on govern ment securities Scotch banks so much harped about can issue but 2676350 uncovered notes As extraordinary troubles require extraordinary remedies in order to ameliorate some of the calami tous panic conditions which have overtaken Britain history says the Bank of England in 1847 1857 and 1866 after the panics had paralyzed her progress on the assurance of the government officials that no prosecution would follow suspended the bank act as to issuing notes only on the deposit of a like amount of either coin or bullion and it issued notes to the banking department on deposit by it with the issue department of ample securities This was an unlawful act giving elasticity to the currency but it placed the banking department in an easy condition to discount freely to all solvent parties Again in 1838 the bank borrowed 2500 ooo from the Bank of France during panic conditions and in 189o during the Baring troubles she borrowed 3000000 besides 2oooooo from outside sources and the panics were stayed The Barings failed for Io5oooooo and yet their indebtedness was liquidated by the Bank of England with the aid of other local banks without general suspension of cash payments as experienced in the last months of 1907 in the United States The apparent neces sity for these extraordinary acts was that the country had reached a commercial crisis where good securities could not be sold for cash Suspension and consequent ruin were staring sound com mercial houses and banks in the face In each case the action of the bank afforded instant relief and 38384 The Annals of the American Academy doubtless saved hundreds of millions of dollars to tottering houses unable to meet payments except for uch relief As soon as the pressure was over the illegal issues were retired These unlawful acts were parallel to our clearinghouse cer tificates except that clearinghouise certificates have but limited use whereas the Bank of England notes satisfy the insane demands of frightened depositors and give sufficient elasticity to meet neces sary demands for loans to solvent parties so that the wheels of commerce be not stilled Should the Bank of England be legally empowered to relieve extraordinary pressure on the same lines as in 1847 1857 and 1866 before paralysis takes place the benefits undoubtedly would be incalculable Nearly all political economists criticize this feature which seems to be the only material defect without which the Bank of England would be ideal in practically all respects Germany With the exception of only four banks which are allowed to issue say eighteen millions of dollars of uncovered notesand these privileges are doomedthe Imperial Bank of Germany monop olizes that right The bank is allowed to issue now about 112500000 uncovered circulation under certain restrictions Any excess over that sum must pay 5 per cent interest per annum to the government This excess issue is the only true method by which to obtain relief under panic conditions as the interest rate will certainly retire the redundant currency as soon as the pres sure for funds is over thus preventing inflation It is a noteworthy fact that the Imperial Bank of Germany has raised its discount rate to 7 per cent but once in thirty years except during our panic of 1907 when its rate was raised to 72 per cent It is also a noteworthy fact that during that thirtyyear period the bank issued such 5 per cent taxed currency 121 times as a relief measure under pressure The AustroHun garian bank did likewise under similar conditions fiftyfive times in the past eighteen years In the face of the fact that interest rates are lower there than here such 5 per cent taxed currency auto matically expands under pressure and contracts as soon as the pressure is over thus preventing inflation This fact defies theory and upsets the absurd claim that a high taxed currency imposes 384Diagnosis of Worlds Elastic Currency Problems 85 such a tax on commerce that banks will not use it Germanys uncovered currency averages say 150000000 which is a wide contrast to our 9ooooooo and over today But enough These details and the foregoing table are con clusive evidence that eladticity in Europe by an evolutionary process has been achieved without producing distrust or inflation Issuing Currency is not a Necessary Banking Function Further it does not seem to be a necessary function of banks generally in Europe to issue currency at all As state and other banks in the United States issue no currency I assert the special privilege ought to be abolished as to the other third as soon as the banks owning the abnormally low rate 2 per cent interest bonds can obtain payment for them Banks holding them run great risk of material depreciation should the government for any cause be compelled to issue large sums additional Let the United States sell its bonds strictly on their merits as every other nation does This result ought to be brought about by a slow evolutionary process and under natural economic laws the channels of circulation would automatically fill the vacuum created with the worlds standardgold Adam Smith gives an illustration in point in his Wealth of NationsMoney like wine must always be scarce with those who have neither the wherewithal to buy or the credit to borrow it Those who have either will seldom be in want of either the money or the wine which they have occasion for and a country that has where withal to buy gold or silver will never be in want of those metals I am strongly impressed that the United States has the wherewithal to buy all the gold and silver we need for a basis of our circulating medium If some of the poor sections of our country are short on circulation is it not because they are also short on collateral or wherewithal to buy it The Lesson from American History Let us turn to the United States without specific reference to the disastrous results of continental currency in the eighteenth century which might be excusable as the birth of the nation was at stake The History of Banking in all Nations says in referring to all banks of issue from 1739 to 1841 The esti 38586 The Annals of the American Academy mated losses on their circulation were 181 millions of dollars Again on page 337under Free and Safety Fund Banking in New York State the notes of twentyfive of them were re jected and all the safety fund notes were at a discount Again In December I84O it was reported that few brokers would buy the notes of any free banking association and the notes of many of the safety fund banks of the interior are regarded with great distrust John J Knox in his history says that from 1789 to 1864 the probable losses to noteholders were about 5 per cent per annum Further the circulating notes of the state banks were subject to violent expansion in times of confidence and sudden contraction when distrust occurred The runs on the banks were not made by the depositors for they were few but by the noteholders The pages of these authorities as well as many others are strewn with proofs of the sickening details of losses to noteholders caused by bank issues some based on credit and others based on various collaterals clear through the eighteenth and even past the middle of the nineteenth century Because much of the currency issued during the latter period was secured by collaterals instead of being a pure credit currency the nineteenth century experiences lessened materially the comparative losses to noteholders every where but still they were calamitous in results up to the end of the wild cat days in the United States Two generations have passed since then wherein no man has lost a moments sleep over his absolutely secured national bank notes We ought not to need like children to be told to keep away from the fire We ought to profit by the experience of the past before trouble overtakes us again That word elasticity is a sweet morsel to play upon the credulity of an innocent public It has worried the political econo mists of all ages Its ghost still stalks forth in this enlightened day Panics and the Monetary Standard All property was measured in depreciated currency in 1865 when gold was Ioo per cent premium and over Then the premium began to decline year by year and all property in proportion until 1873 by which time values had shrunk to about onehalf of the prices of I865 This process undermined all prosperity and was 386Diagnosis of Worlds Elastic Currency Problems 87 the underlying cause of the panic of 1873 After specie payments were resumed in 1879 confidence and prosperity revived with a bound and they have been forging onward and upward ever since at a pace which has astonished the world A campaign of education has been constantly and successfully waged toward the establish ment of the worlds standardgoldupon an unequivocal founda tion Distrust of our standard halted us from 1893 to 1896 when the repudiators were repudiated and since that date the Gold Stan dard Act of March 14 1900oo has been written into our statutes and thus the battle of the standards has been practically won There are two links missing to complete the chain They are the elimination of some of our redundant soft money issues and the adoption of some sound relief measure when panic threatens Since 1896 when confidence was restored as to the integrity of our standard of value the wave of prosperity has been almost continuously rising higher and higher Under the impetus of rapid fortunes acquired by some Naipoleons of finance since 1896 who foresaw that a swelling tide of prosperity was at hand the getrich quick fever intoxicated the many Nature has been generous in her bounties to us thus aiding in the development of the rising tide Another force has been the immense increase in the worlds production of gold for the past few years which doubtless has stimulated the activities and credit expansion of the whole com mercial world During this period our credit system has grown to collossal proportions As shown by official statistics our banking power has increased from 5150 millions of dollars in 1890 to nearly 18ooo millions of dollars on January I 19o8 which nearly equals the banking power of the rest of the world The individual deposits have more than trebled in that period which largely represents actual not fictitious capital The gigantic general statistics of our wonderful progress and present condition are too numerous and too well known to repeat During the past ten years our circulating medium has doubled in quantity from 1500 to 3000 millions of dollars until as a basis for this mighty superstructure of credit we hold the following amounts of the worlds standard of value that stands through storm as well as sunshine 38788 The Annals of the American Academy TABLE NO 2 In gold coin say  I6oooooooo In addition we have In silver say onehalf fiat about  700000000 Legal tender notes  346000000 National bank notes about  690o00000 I736oooooo By way of comparison with the most progressive nations permit the following approximate TABLE NO 3 In Millions Gold Silver Uncovered Per capita currency circulation United States holds  1600 700 900 3550 Great Britain holds  559 117 116 1808 France holds  r32 400 120 3994 Germany holds  917 2oo i8o 2218 This table shows the United States has nearly as much silver as Great Britain France and Germany combined and more than twice as much uncovered currency as all combined It also shows a per capita circulation almost equal to that of France where cash instead of checks is used much more extensively than here This per capita circulation is also so far in excess of either Great Britain or Germany that the redundancy of our currency must be apparent to all The Barometric Signal In view of all these facts even before the explosion caused by the wild speculation and pyramid banking of the Heinze Morse Thomas etc outfit in view of the fact that a high interest rate the world over is the sure barometric signal that the great pyramid of credit has grown beyond the limits of prudence in view of the handwriting upon the wall as recorded by all the standard author ities on political economy that optimism had outrun conservatism and that the primary cause of our troubles is overspeculation I will only quote in proof from one standard authority Professor Sum ner in his History of American Currency tersely sums up the case as follows Overspeculation is speculation which outstrips 388Diagnosis of Worlds Elastic Currency Problems 89 the capital of the country further When we lose our heads in the intoxication of our own achievements look on currency antici pations which are only fictitious capital as if they were real use them as already earned build other expansions upon them then we bring a convulsion and a downfall some time or other a liqui dation must come    then credit breaks down and there must be a settlement a liquidation a dividend a new start I say in iew of all these facts I cannot understand why the powers that be in the great American Bankers Association who ought to be the leaders in conservatism should undertake to bring about a senti ment to commit this country to eighteenth century fiatism again by the issueon top of our vast volume of soft money issuesof over two hundred million dollars of asset or credit currency as a starter only according to one of the most aggressive advocates with only 5 per cent secured and 95 per cent fiat under the plea of providing an elastic currency to move the crops notwithstanding crops could not move faster as transportation facilities have been taxed to their utmost for years Who wants to move the earth today and lie idle tomorrow  The American Bankers Association Plan The American Bankers Association plan boiled down and put in cold type can fairly be diagnosed in this way I National banks none others need apply big and little in city or country can indite a letter as follows COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY WASHINGTON D C Please send to this bank the 25000 50000 or Iooooo of asset or credit currency to which it may be entitled keep 5 per cent of it on deposit as collateral security express the other 95 per cent to us and we will return the same to you at our pleasure plus 2 per cent per annum Very respectfully Cashier 2 The Comptroller of the Currency shall designate numer ous redemption cities conveniently located in various parts of the 38990 The Annals of the American Academy country Through the agency of the banks in such cities ade quate facilities shall be provided for active daily redemption of credit notes The advocates of this redemption plan now admit it impractical so no answer to it is necessary 3 A bank credit note is essentially the same in principle as a deposit payable on demand This is an amazing conclusion Political economists say Coined credit in the shape of I O Us issued by banks is fictitious capital A deposit generally repre sents actual capital so no further argument on that point seems necessary In reply to the foregoing I issued the following five chal lenges in a debate before the State Bankers Association of Minne sota in July 1907 in response to John L Hamilton exPresident of the American Bankers Association who advocated the Amer ican Bankers Association plan to wit I I respectfully challenge any member of the currency com mittee or any advocate of asset currency to point to a single pro gressive country on the earth where small independent country banks are allowed to issue currency backed by only 5 per cent collateral the remaining 95 per cent of such currency being purely fiat 2 I challenge any man to prove that easy methods of issuing currency have not been discarded in all progressive nations 3 I challenge any man to disprove the fact that with but few exceptions where charters have not expired in all progressive nations only great centralized banks with very large reserves and rigid restrictions as to loans are allowed to issue currency at all and the right to issue is limited under rigid restrictions referred to later 4 I challenge any man to prove that the method of redemp tion proposedwhich the asset currency advocates claim as the crucial test of success or failurehas any parallel on earth or affords any practical assurance that it will work under our bank ing system 5 I challenge any man to prove that a bank note is essen tially the same in principle as a deposit payable on demand or that it resembles in character    a current deposit liability of the bank 390Diagnosis of Worlds Elastic Currency Problems 91 After the debate what was the verdict of the Minnesota jury The answer is found in the condemnation of the American Bank ers Association plan as will be seen by the passage of the follow ing resolution unanimously WHEREAS The prosperity of our country is due in a large measure to the absolute confidence of our people in our present currency be it Resolved That while we are strongly in favor of some wellsecured method to relieve monetary stringencies that will not produce inflation yet we are unalterably opposed to any plan or change in our currency that does not afford absolute security hence we do not look with favor upon the plan proposed by the American Bankers Association committee Later after listening to John Perrin President of the Ameri can National Bank of Indianapolis and member of the association currency committee in favor of its plan the State Bankers Asso ciation of Wisconsin passed the same resolutions with only two dissenting voices Still laterafter the meeting of the American Bankers Association at Atlantic City when with practically an empty house and under discreditable conditions the plan was apparently endorsedthe State Bankers Association of Indiana after a full debate on the same subject where O A Watts Presi dent of the First National Bank of Nashville Tenn took the affir mative and I had the honor of the negative side notwithstanding a strong effort to table the resolutions by able representatives of the American Bankers Association the Hoosiers turned down the plan by indorsing in full the same resolutions These facts representing the judgment of bankers when a fair hearing could be had indicate clearly that the banks of the country generally are against fiat money The committee of the American Bankers Association evidently doubted the soundness of their own proposition as is evidenced by the selfindictment contained in the following quotation taken from the Atlantic City currency com mittee reported to the convention In all our recommendations principle has to a greater or less degree been subordinated to practicability We have recommended not what we believe in the light of experience and existing conditions to be best for the interests subserved but what in the light of existing political conditions we believe to be attainable not what was best but what we might reasonably hope to obtain 39192 The Annals of the American Academy President Roosevelts Opinion President Roosevelt clearly grasps the essential weakness of the plan as will be seen in the following quotations from his last message to Congress when he refers to the absorbing currency question We need greater elasticity in our currency provided of course that we recognize the even greater need of a safe and secured currency  Provision should be made for an emergency currency The emergency issue should of course be made with an effective guaranty and upon conditions carefully prescribed by the government Such emergency issue must be based on adequate securities approved by the government and must be issued under a heavy tax This would permit currency being issued when the demand for it was urgent while securing its retirement as the demand fell off The Aldrich Bill And now comes the Finance Committee of the United States Senate with a bill in all its essential features demanding absolute security for all issues to prevent distrust with such a high tax 6 per centas will bring such currency out only under stress and will surely retire it as soon as pressure is over thus preventing further inflation These essentials seem to be ignored under the American Bankers Association plan because under it the currency if issued would be practically unsecured and would still further inflate our circulation The American Bankers Association plan undoubtedly would arouse distrust in the minds of the masses especially in troublous times when it is of paramount importance to allay distrust When panic is on as the asset currency advocates claim a deposit is the same thing as asset currency and local depositors are clamoring for cash why will not eighty million holders of such currency demand coin on their notes thus more than doubling our troubles under panic conditions This is exactly what occurred in fiat money days Taint our currency issues with a breath of suspicion and our prosperity will be undermined as by an insidious disease Even the first lien on assets which would make the currency secure but which would rob the depositors is eliminated under this plan thus increasing general distrust Again as the quick redemption theory will not work which is now admitted by asset currency advocates does any sane man believe that any bank in the United States 392Diagnosis of Worlds Elastic Currency Problems 93 with a right to issue asset currency practically without collateral paying only 2Y2 per cent per annum for the use of it in the face of a 6 to io per cent interest rate clear through 1907 would not have kept out the whole permissible amount for the profit in it thus stretching the rubber currency to the limit Under such con ditions the reservoir would have been empty when the panic of 1907 struck us Would not the very object sought relief under panic conditions be defeated The result would simply spell in flation and inflation spells disaster Such currency would ex pand but not contract The currency committee seems to have lost sight of the fundamental principle of Greshams law Britain after a campaign as long and as bitter as ours over the Gresham Law and the expulsion of her gold by the injection of too many bank notes into her circulation unequivocally adopted the gold standard in 1816 The integrity of that standard as against the uncertainties of other national standards has been maintained with a fidelity that commands the confidence of the whole world to such an extent that London has long been the worlds clearing house Will New York soon win that position if we inject an additional quantity of inferior currency into our circulation  A wise man buildeth his house upon a rock but the foolish man upon the sand When the rain descends and the floods come and the winds blow the wise mans house falleth not but as to the foolish mans house great is the fall thereof Is not this a perfect simile to apply to the building up of the superstructure of our credit system upon a sound metallic currency for a founda tion as against the shifting sands of a credit currency The pages of history are strewn with proofs that when the great instrument of exchange is deranged all trade all industry is stricken as with a palsy That instrument of exchange recognized by the world as the solid foundation that does not totter when the storm rages in its severest intensity is the only foundation for a prosperous people to rest upon and today our coffers hold sixteen hundred million dollars of it This is a billion dollar country and we need these resources This gold has come to us since 1873 in the natural course of trade in response to the wellknown principles of the Gresham law and monetary science as expounded by Adam Smith Ricardo Jevons Sumner and many other eminent econo mists and as also clearly set forth in what Professor Sumner dubs 39394 The Annals of the American Academy the most important document in financial literature The Cele brated Bullion Report of 18io to the House of Commons I have quoted these maxims before but deepseated error requires repetition of them again and again Summed up these principles are I The cry of all ages is for more money 2 Rich countries will have all the coin they need providing no impolitic act of legislation interferes to force it out of circula tion by the injection of inferior currencies 3 When the coin in any country exceeds the effectual de mand no vigilance of government can prevent its exportation 4 It is the province of government to settle the quality ques tion of money and the needs of commerce will settle the quantity In proof of the above maxims history says Chinese walls jails shot guns or hanging did not prevent exportation of coin and in these modern days the object lesson of the exportation of more than thirty millions of gold in May and June 1907 in the face of high interest rates and the plea of the asset currency advocates for more money in the United States is more potent than pages of logic Let us fix the quality question and stop tinkering with the quantity as the needs of commerce will settle that With over 1700 million dollars of soft money in the United States today would not the injection of 200 to 300 millions of inferior asset or credit currency drive the same amount of gold out under the Gresham Law thus undermining our metallic foun dation for our great credit superstructure Let us bend our ener gies to increase our metallic foundation and reduce our redundant soft money issues if we would avoid trouble as far as human in genuity can accomplish it The only true remedy to compel con servatism is to penalize overexpansion of credit instead of adding an unsecured asset currency stimulant Throw a life line out to the overconfident and he will be swimming beyond his depth con tinually Asset Currency Fallacies The asset currency advocates are continually referring to the Canadian and Suffolk systems also isolated cases in Indiana Louis iana Iowa and other states as parallel to our conditions Their arguments are as full of holes as a skimmer and socalled parallels 394Diagnosis of Worlds Elastic Currency Problems 95 are as closely related as the Equator is to the North Pole They are also continually quoting general European branch banking methods as systems for us to adopt I stand with the masses of bankers of the country against a few great central banks owning all the banks of the country because under that system the branches practically pay no taxes where they are located there is no real board of directors few if any stockholders to whom dividends would be declared in short the system simply skims the cream from the country towns to enrich the exchequers of the great centers as is conclusively proved by the abnormally large profits made by the great central banks owning such branches A National Reserve Bank As our independent banking system has worked wonders in the upbuilding of our hamlets and cities as the quality of our money is unquestioned and the quantity more than ample for nor mal conditions as Europe has more nearly solved the Elastic Problem with fewer objectionable features than any plan yet suggested why cannot we reject as entirely unnecessary the gen eral branch banking feature continue if thought best the United States subtreasuries with modifications as to cash holdings and bring about elasticity through a national reserve bank Such a bank would be owned by the banks of the country and thus the profits would be theirs The capital stock might be 5oooooo0 and be taken in sums of not to exceed 5 per cent of the capital of each subscribing bank to prevent monopoly The Comptroller of the Currency Secretary of the Treasury and United States Treasurer should be members of the Board of Directors The National Reserve Bank if such we may call it might have authority to issue up to 250000000 of national bank notes as an experimental limit under a tax of 6 per cent to drive it home as soon as pressure is over Again under strained conditions or when frightened depos itois are demanding cash and solvent merchants and manufac turers are calling for loans to pay bills and keep the wheels of commerce frori being stilled where is the banker that will not temporarily provide cash if possible at 6 per cent or even a higher rate if necessary instead of slaughtering sound securities in a hard market Do not many bankers when capital demands exceed 39596 The Annals of the American Academy supply get rediscounts now and is much comment made unless rddiscounts become excessive No interest should be paid upon deposits nor should loans be made upon stocks thus giving no aid to the stock gambling element Such issues should be loaned only under conservative restrictions on quickly convertible securities I believe if such a bank had been open in October 1907 the panic with its train of evils might have been avoided because the gamblers who were the cause of the outbreak could have been refused aid and thus have been weeded out as a future menace The sound and solvent banks of New York could have been furnished with all the cash needed because they have ample sound collateral The country calls for balances in New York could have been promptly met with cash Suspension of cash payments then would not have been necessary and the result would have been that the whole country would not have been compelled to restrict cash payments nor to issue clearing house certificates On the other hand if the American Bankers Associations 2 2 or 3 per cent currency plan had been authorized last winter the full limit would have been out for the profit in it when the panic struck us The National Reserve Bank plan will accomplish the object sought in an absolutely sound manner it will checkmate locking up cash as was done some months ago by a bear to the extent of 5000000 in an attempt to bring on another Black Friday onslaught The banks of the country will not hoard money in excess of needs because they will know relief is at hand if needed It will not lead the bankers of the country generally to further expand their credit and thus feed the fires of speculation which have already gone beyond the limits of conservatism It will not drive gold out of the country under Greshams Law by the injec tion of any more inferior currencies which must be avoided if our standard of values is to be maintained and if New York City is ever to become the worlds financial center It will furnish cash at times when necessary to move the crops or under panic conditions to loan to all solvent parties that the wheels of com merce be not stilled and general paralysis result The rate of interest will automatically drive home the extra issues as soon as confidence is restored inflation will not result and the machinery will be ready for the next urgent call 10 20 50 Ioo per cent 396Diagnosis of Worlds Elastic Currency Problmcns 97 money will be unknown the Secretary of the Treasury will heave a sigh of relief from pressing importunities every bank in the country whether national state private savings or trust company will directly or indirectly get relief if entitled to it In the matter under discussion clearly the trend of all progressive countries is toward the concentration of the power to issue currency If this plan cannot be accomplished then the plan brought out by the Senate Finance Committee as a modification of Treasurer Treats plan will accomplish the relief sought by the issue of extra currency amply secured to prevent distrust with a tax suffi ciently high to prevent inflation These requirements are the main essentials A third planwhich would accomplish the relief sought would be the issue of currency based on clearinghouse certificates such as have been lately issued Such certificates should be deposited with the United States Treasurer as security for such issues It is cash that fills demands and kills panic I prefer the central bank plan because the machinery works smoothly and automatically more so than under the second plan and much more so than under the third All three are sound and infinitely better than asset currency which will only produce dis trust and inflation Confidence upbuilds distrust destroys States manship alone should reign Whatever plan is provided our stan dard of value should never be tarnished because distrust breeds panic On the contrary our currency should be above suspicion that confidence the great bulwark of all progress may be ours to the fullest possible extent 397

j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1013336,Americas Possible Contribution to the Worlds Peace,i242645,AMERICAS POSSIBLE CONTRIBUTION TO THE WORLDS PEACE BY OSCAR S STRAUS Former Ambassador and member of the Permanent Court of Arbitrat on at the Hague Any discussion of Americas possible contribution to the worlds peace must at this time in the nature of things be purely speculative and hypothetical Whether this war will end by the decided vic tory of the one side or the other or whether it will be prolonged to a state of exhaustion or whether before such a state is reached and in recognition of the probability that such will be the result the war ring nations may come together by their representatives in con ference to arrange for the conclusion of the war and for plans to secure by negotiation what they may have failed to secure at the cannons mouththese are questions surrounded with so much uncertainty at the present time that no one is justified in forming a definite conclusion President Wilson and his administration animated by the high and noble desire to conserve the moral influence of our country as a mediator and peacemaker have made and are making every effort to maintain not only a strict attitude of neutrality but also a spirit of impartiality on the part of our people To quote the Presidents words from his recent address to the members of the Associated Press Let us think of America before we think of Europe in order that America may be fit to be Europes friend when the day of tested friendship comes The test of friendship is not now sympathy with the one side or the other but getting ready to help both sides when the struggle is over And yet with all this effort on the part of our government which has been consistently urged by the President and followed since the beginning of the war and sometimes in the face of severe provocation our governments attitude has been misinterpreted as is evidenced by the press not only in Germany but likewise in Great Britain and in the other belligerent countries This misinterpreta tion faultfinding and even reproof have been officially expressed in a 230AMERICA AND THE WORLDS PEACE 231 statement authoritatively given out a short time ago by the German ambassador protesting against our not observing our neutral obli gations Utterances in some of the leading British papers would indicate that our attitude of neutrality likewise does not satisfy public opinion in that country I refer to these facts because the attitude and the disposition toward us of the belligerent nations will have a direct bearing upon what contribution we may be invited or permitted to make in aiding in the establishment of peace among the warring nations and in the development of plans for securing the permanent peace of the world There is yet another important consideration which we shall have to determine for ourselves before it will be possible for us to have a part or take a part in devising plans for the peace of the world The American traditional policy has been expressed in two important state papers in Washingtons farewell address and in President Monroes message to Congress which state papers have a prestige and authority second only to the Declaration of Indepen dence and the Constitution of the United States Washington in his farewell address stated that Europe had a set of primary interests which to us have none or very remote relations His thought was that it was the course of wisdom so far as possible to disassociate America from the ordinary vicissitudes of European politics Monroe in his message amplified the Washington policy as the changed circumstances and the immediate necessities demanded by reminding the powers of the Holy Alliance of our policy in regard to European nations that we would not interfere in their internal concern and that we would not regard their interference in the affairs of the government of the states on the American continent with indifference This American policy in its double form was annexed to the signatures of the American delegates to the Hague convention and was spread on the minutes of the conference and as such recognized by the nations of the world The question therefore naturally arises has America the right to demand participation in the conferences of the belligerent nations following the present war for the purposes of arranging for the future peace of the world Another question presents itself even if we should not have the right and in the event that we should232 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY be invited by the belligerent nations as the leading neutral power to participate in such a conference can we do so without impliedly if not expressly relinquishing our traditional attitude of exclusive control over purely American questions This contingency will bring to the foreground the consideration if not the wisdom of a further extension if not a reversing of the American traditional policy as outlined by Washington when he said The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is in extend ing our commercial relations to have with them as little political connection as possible So far as we have already formed engagements let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith Here let us stop The question that would present itself have not the world relations and the interdependent interests of nations since Wash ingtons admonition was given become so closely and intimately related so that our duty to other nations as well as our own en lightened selfinterests make it imperative upon us not to stop but to unite with the nations of the world in such a policy be it by international agreement by entering into a league with the leading nations of the world or by becoming a member of a world federa tion or by uniting in such a joint arrangement as in the wisdom of nations may be determined upon as the most practical and effective for the establishment and maintenance of the peace of the world From generation to generation we have been making radical changes in our internal policies and notably in the direction of the enlargement of the powers of the central government The Inter state Commerce Laws and the Federal Reserve Act are themselves distinct evidences of those changes A nation cannot remain sta tionary any more in its national than in its international relation ship and policy New occasions teach new duties It is not improbable that the outgrowth of this war will affect the future policies not only of the belligerent nations but of neutral nations as well Norman Angell says that if we do not mix in European affairs Europe will mix in our affairs and that the day of isolation for us whether we like it or not is over He may be right It is much easier for a country when it is small in population and in interests to remain aloof than when it becomes one of the great powers of the world Our country with its population of a hundred million and its expanded world commerce is too large aAMERICA AND THE WORLDS PEACE 233 factor to stand aloof from world questions In the event of a league or confederation of the leading nations for us to separate ourselves by refusing to assume our share of responsibility might conflict with our national interests and our international duties and have the result of placing ourselves in opposition to the world policies of the new worldstate In such an event would it not be better for such a worldstate as well as for ourselves to form a part of such a state and help to shape its policies as one of the im portant constituent members than to conserve our traditional pol icies and stand aloof These are questions that not unlikely I might say very prob ably will present themselves to the American government at the outcome of the present war or even before in contributing its mediatory offices in bringing the war to a conclusion Our country has as deep a concern not only morally but economically and industrially in the peace of the world as any one of the larger nations A war such as this or upon such a consider able scale affects under the changed economic and commercial conditions and relationships of modern times the neutral nations only to a lesser degree than the nations actually at war And therefore have we not the right and is it not our duty to co6perate to the fullest of our power in the perfection and the maintenance of a plan for the preservation of peace It is to be hoped that the extreme suffering and sacrifice that this war entails may have the compensation of developing supreme wisdom on the part of the nations The nations of the world to be at peace must develop a broader patriotism as distinguished from a national jingoism a more enlightened sense of justice which does not preach one gospel on one side of a national border and a different or opposite gospel on the other side In other words so long as the standards of national justice and international justice are not in consonance but on different levels and in many respects directly opposed to one another the security for peace must largely depend upon the doctrine of might Until the international con science is brought under the majesty of the law there can be no permanent security for international peace Perhaps the most guiding and impressive contribution that America can make to the worlds peace is the successful experiment and example of its federated union of fortyeight separate common234 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY wealths which affords to the world a striking illustration that its preservation is due to the fact that behind the right of each one of these commonwealths the smallest as well as the largest stands the united might of all This greatest of all wars involving directly nearly twothirds of the population of the world is a glaring and ghastly evidence that international relationship has to be recon structed that the plans heretofore devised of nations standing alone or separating themselves into two or three great divisions under dual or triple alliances and ententes have lamentably broken down and instead of lessening the area and the horrors of war have had the opposite result and drawn nations into war that otherwise would have remained at peace Therefore the federation or league of all the states in the Amer ican union embodies the ideal if not the plan for a universal league or federation of the nations as the surest and safest guarantee for securing the permanent peace of the world In such a federation power will be needed not for aggression but to prevent aggression Power will be needed not to promote the selfish ends of individual nations but to curb them Power will be needed not for making war but for repressing war for maintaining peace Power will be needed not for breaking treaties but for maintaining them and this power must not be vested in one but in all the nations

and Mr Ivorys table 8 49 6 The author however observes that there is no reason for proceeding to compute a new table by this formula since the method employed for that in the Nautical Almanac is in all common cases more com pendious and even if it were desired to represent Mr Ivorys table by the approximation there employed we might obtain the same re sults with an error scarcely exceeding a single second from an equation of the same form The Bakerian Lecture On certain Motions produced in Fluid Con ductors when transmitting the Electric Current By J F W Her schel Esq FRS Read February 12 1824 Phil Trans 1824 p 162 In the first paragraphs of this lecture Mr Herschel describes the phenomena that result on placing a portion of mercury covered with sulphuric acid between the voltaic poles immersed on opposite sides of the globule of metal but in contact with the acid only They consist in active motion of those particles of the acid in contact with the mercury while the superficial molecules of the metal continually radiate from the point nearest the negative pole and darting to the positive pole return along the axis The author particularly notices several singular appearances resulting from this current and shows them to be independent of any electromagnetic vortices to which at first sight they present considerable analogy They are incom parably more forcible in proportion to the electric powers used than the motions produced by the action of magnets hence they furnish an extremely sensible test of the development of feeble Voltaic pow ers not easily rendered sensible by other means The author next describes the appearances observed in cases where other liquids and metals are used and adverts to the influence of several causes upon the uniformity of the results Among these im purity in the mercury is especially noticed which should not only be carefully distilled but also well washed with dilute nitric acid Mer cury thus prepared and placed in the current as before exhibits phe nomena varying with the nature of the liquidgenerally speaking currents are produced radiating from the point nearest the negative pole which are most violent in acids and less in saline solutions in proportion as the electropositive energy of the base is greater In many liquids a countercurrent from the positive pole is observed but if either pole be brought in contact with the mercury no cur rents are observed from the point of contact but strong ones are perceived to radiate from the other If the negative pole touch it it amalgamates with the mercury which remains bright if the positive the mercury rapidly oxidizes and in both cases currents are pro duced Mr Herschel proceeds to observe that when mercury is electrizedin saline solutions its properties are generally altered and he de scribes at length the phenomena thus presented in a solution of sulphate of soda which were peculiar and apparently perplexing but which he found to depend upon the presence of amalgam of so dium counteracting the effect of the negative pole and exalting that of the positive in proportion to its quantity until it overcomes and even reverses it That sodium is actually present in these cases the author shows by the following experimentHaving detached the negative wire he touched the mercury now lying quiet in the liquid with a platinum or copper wire and a violent action instantly be gan The mercury rushed to the wire in a superficial current and it gave off abundance of hydrogen the sodium wire and liquid forming a voltaic combination sufficiently powerful to decompose the water The author next proceeds to investigate more minutely the effects of different metals in their contact and amalgamation with mercury employing solutions of the caustic alkalies for the conducting liquids which have the advantage of producing no currents in pure mercury so long as neither pole is in contact with it In liquid potash a contact with the negative pole of a single seconds continuance im parted to 100 grains of mercury the property of rotating violently from the positive to the negative pole when the circuit was com pleted in the liquid alone The rotation was even sensible when the quantity of potassium did not probably exceed a millionth part of the whole mass With sodium similar effects were observed and even where the proportion of sodium to mercury was only as 1 to 1600000 a feeble motion was sensible The influence of barium strontium calcium and magnesium and of zinc lead tin and iron is next described the alloys of these metals being all possessed of the positive property Copper on the other hand does not communicate motion though present in considerable proportion nor do bismuth silver nor gold Mr Herschel concludes this lecture with some general and the oretical observations and deductions founded on his experimental inquiries These relate principally to the exceedingly minute pro portions of extraneous matter capable of communicating sensible me chanical motions and properties of a definite character to the body they are mixed with When we see energies so intense exerted by the ordinary forms of matter we may says the author reasonably ask what evidence we have for the imponderability of any of the pow erful agents to which so large a part of the activity of material bodies seems to be owing Among the essential conditions of the phenomena the author par ticularly adverts to the vast difference of conducting power between the metallic bodies set in motion and the liquid under which they are immersed to the necessity of the perfect immiscibility of the con ducting fluids so as to render the transition of one to the other quite sudden and to a certain chemical or electrical relation between VOL II P210 them Under these conditions Mr Herschel observes the pheno menon may admit of explanation from what we already know of the passage of electricity through conductors and the high attractive and repulsive powers of the two electricities inter se A body so highly positive as potassium present in the mercury may for instance have its natural electrical state exalted by its vicinity to the positive pole and being thus repelled may take the only course the resistance of the metal on the one hand and attraction of cohesion on the other will permit viz along the surface to recede from the positive pole it may even act as a carrier to the positive electricity which may ad here to it too strongly to be transmitted through the mercury and when arrived at the opposite side of the globule may there by the in fluence of the opposite pole lose its exalted electrical state Such an explanation however is not without its difficulties and although another is open to us that of considering the action which takes place at the common surface of two unequally conducting media as dependent upon a new power of the electric current bearing some analogy to magnetic action yet this in the present state of the investigation must be regarded not only as a bold but vague hy pothesis Experiments and Observations on the Development of Magnetical Pro perties in Steel and Iron by Percussion Part II By William Scoresby Jun FRSE c Communicated by Sir Humphry Davy Bart Pres RS Read January 29 1824 Phil Trans 1824 p 197 After adverting to the general results of his former inquiries the author observes that his principal objects on the present occasion were to endeavour by auxiliary rods of iron to increase the degree of magnetism and to ascertain on what circumstances as to the magnitude of the iron rods and the quality size and temper of the steel wires the utmost success of the method depends He formerly used a single iron rod upon which the steel bars were hammered both being in a vertical position He now places the steel wire between two rods of iron and subjecting it through the medium of the upper rod to percussion derives the advantage of the magnet ism of both rods of iron acting at the same time upon both its poles The rods he used were of the respective lengths of three and one foot and an inch diameter and the upper end of the larger rod and the lower one of the smaller rod were made conical there being an in dentation in each to receive the ends of the steel wire Some mag netism was then elicited by percussion in the larger rod and the steel wire being properly placed between its upper extremity and the lower one of the small rod the upper end of the latter was ham mered and magnetism thus communicated to the wire whilst the lower rod receiving some influence from the percussion performed a similar office The author calls this mode of proceeding the comn

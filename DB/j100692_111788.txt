On the Perihelia and Nodes of the Planets By EDWARD J COOPER FRS Received February 2 1855 Prefatory to my volume on Cometic Orbits published in 1852 1 invited the attention of astronomers to the several points of resem blance between the planetary orbits and those of periodic comets Amiong these it was shown that of the heliocentric longitudes of perihelia and ascending nodes of the then known planets and periodic comets twothirds were situated in the heliocentric semicircle between 315 and 135 The planets stood tlhus in quadranits L Ps between 45 and 135 9 135 and 2254  225 and 3153 7 16 315 and 45 7J SA between 45 and 135 13 135 and 225 4 8 225 and 3154 J 1 315 and 45 1J Here the L Ps appeared as 16 to 7 and the ascending nodes as 14 to 8 Two additional asteroids were subsequently discovered leaving the L Ps as 16 to 9 and the ascending nodes as 15 to 9 Again in 1853 1 sent a note upon the same subject to the Royal Astronomical Society of London At that time a considerable addi tion had been made to the asteroids and the total number of planets had risen from 25 to 35 Following the same distribuition of the296 perihelia and ascending nodes as in my previously published work the result was L Psbetween 45 and 135 13 135and2255 1 24 225 and 3156 315 and 45 1lJ A between 45 and 135 19 135 and 2259 1 225 and 3154 13 21 315 and 45 2 The suspicion of some yet undiscovered law became strengthened by this further investigation and it occurred to me to ascertain if any other heliocentric semicircles would mark the effect of such law more clearly Let me be permitted to extract the concluding pass age from the note as it is printed in the Royal Astronomical Societys Notices  But if instead of the semicircles 3150 to 135 and 1350 to 3150 we adopt those from 450 to 225 and 225 to 450 we see that of the ascending nodes of thirtyfour planiets twentyeight are found in the first semicircle and only six in the second Again the semicircles that contain the greatest number of L Ps of planets are between 00 and 1800 or 100 and 190 That which contains the greatest num ber of nodes isl between 350 and 2150 In the first case there are twentysix and in the latter twentynine The quadrant containingl the largest number of L Ps of planets is that between 110 and 1010 of which there are sixteen That containing the largest of nodes is from 35 to 12540 of which there are twenty At the present moment January 1855 we have orbits more or less accurate of fortyone planets It cannot be altogether unin teresting to pursue once more the traces of a law still uniknowan if it have existence Our position now stands thus LPsbetween 45 and 135 16 135 and 225 6 1 2 225 and 315 6 12 29 315 and 45 13297 g between 45 and 135 19 135 and 22511 16 24 225 and 315 5 t 315 and 45 5J But be it remembered that in 1853 of the then known planets the greatest number of L Ps were found to be situated in the heliocentric semicircles O0 to 1800 or 100 to 1900 At present we shall find the perihelia of thirty out of the fortyone planets in either of these semicircles The greatest niumber of nodes were then 1853 between 350 and 315029 and 450 and 225028 At present of forty planets there are thirty nodes in either of these heliocentric semicircles These facts are at least very singular I may tabulate them Of fortyone planets L Ps between 0 and 18030 10 and 19030 Of forty planets A between 35 and 215  30 45 and 22530 and between 3540 to 355 and 174 to 17531 We here perceive that there are thirty L Ps situated in the helio centric semicircle between 00 to 100 and 180 to 1900 It is also tle fact that there are thirty ascending nodes between 3570 to 7 and 177 to 187 which may be called the same semicircle as that in which the thirty L Ps are found The quadrant containing the greatest number of L Ps of the fortyone planets is that between 100 and 100020 Those containing the greatest number of ascending nodes are between 36 to 43 and 126 to 13J320 and between 62 to 66 and 152 to 15620 Surely there must be an undiscovered cause determining the orbits in this way Having laid these facts before my first assistant Mr Graham he computed the degree of probability of such a law arguing thus  Were the nodes and perihelia indifferent to all heliocentric longitudes it would of course be an equal chance in the case of a planet whose orbit had not been determined in which semicircle either would be found and the a priori probability that298 of the fortyone known L Ps thirty would be in one semicircle is about 6Af and that of the forty ascending nodes thirtyone would be in one semicircle is about 4 012 j Thus the probability that there is some influence causing a tendency to one semicircle ascertained from the facts before us is very strong for for the L Ps the odds are about 660 to 1 and for the ascending nodes about 4430 to 1 in favour of such a supposition But after all it may be an accidental coincidence as consistently with the laws of planetary motion such a congregation of perihelia or nodes may occur at periods exceedingly remote The further consideration of this subject must be left to analysts of leisure and inclination to pursue it

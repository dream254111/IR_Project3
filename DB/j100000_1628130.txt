MACFARLANE SOCIETIES AND ACADE3IIES THE RESEARCH CLUB OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN THE Research Club of the University of Michigan was organized two years ago its membership being made up from the University Faculties and its aim being the promotion of research During the year just closed the Club has met six times and its proceedings may be briefly summarized as follows At the first meeting held in October 1900 the theme for discussion was  The Promotion of Research at the University of Michigan Dr Vaughan President of the Club addressed the members on the organization and objects of the Club and closed with remarks on the topic of the evening Professors Wenley Ziwet Adams and Reighard spoke by appointment and they were followed ex tempore by Dr Hulett Dr Bigelow and Dr Dock At the second meeting November 1900 the speakers were Professors Hempl and New combe Professor Hempl spoke on the forma tion of dialect districts in the United States showing with the help of charts the boundaries of various dialectic differences The speaker gave concrete examples of variation in the use and pronunciation of words and phrases and made some attempt to trace the historical de velopment of these variations Professor Newcombe narrated his experiments on the sensitive curves made by roots in response to the streaming of water and in response to contact with a foreign body It was shown that about onehalf of the thirtythree species of plants tested are sensitive to the watercur rent and that of the four waterplants used none is sensitive So far as tested all those plants responding to the watercurrent re sponded to the contact of a foreign body and those not responding to one did not respond to the other Hence it is supposed though not demonstrated that the response in both cases is response to onesided pressure A summary of these results may be found in SCIENCE XIII 1901 p 250 The third meeting came in January 1901 Professor Gomberg detailed the experiments which led to his discovery of the trivalency of carbon Accounts of this work may be found in Jour Amer Chem Soc 22 757 Ber d d Chem Gesellsch 33 3150 Amer Chem Jour 25 317 Dr H S Jennings stated his results in studying the reactions of infusoria to external stimuli illustrating his summary with experi ments made visible to all present by projection with a lantern The researches of which Dr Jennings gave an account have been published in full in various journals and an abstract ap peared in SCIENCE for January 11 1901 XIII 74 ilW the report of the Zoological Journal Club of the University of Michigan The February meeting listened to papers by Dr George Dock and Professor W B Pills bury Dr Dock described the method of teach ing internal medicine in the University The limited time in the medical course makes it 66 SCIENCESCIENCE difficult for undergraduates to do more in the way of research than to work out some original detail In this work they make extensive use of the laboratory method and the effort is made to require students to think for themselves The paper closed with the citation of subjects of investigation followed in the medical clinic Professor Pillsbury presented a summary of a paper entitled  Do the Sensations of Movement Originate in the Joints The narration of his experiments showed that a current through the ankle or elbow was as effective in reducing the sensitiveness of knee or elbow as currents through the joints in question This fact he stated can only be explained if the sensory endings in the tendon or muscle are the seat of the sensation and not the joints as is usually claimed In the March meeting Dr Warthin and Dr Hulett presented papers Dr Warthin spoke on A Contribution to the Normal Histology and Pathology of the Hemolymph Glands preliminary report Inw this paper the occur rence of glands containing bloodsinuses instead of lymphsinuses is for the first time shown to be constant in the human body The distribution of these glands their minute structure their hemolytic function under normal conditions etc are described Two types of these glands splenolymph and marrowlymph glandsare found to occur In a number of cases of fatal anemia pathological changes were found in these glands showing conclusively that they may become centers of red bloodcell formation Dr Hulett presented a report of his measure ments of  The Relation Between Surface Energy and Solubility The theoretical relation be tween surface tension and solubility was dis cussed and experimental data given to show that the solubility of a substance depends upon the curvature of the surfacei e the finer the state of division the more soluble t constant The solubility of gypsum was increased 19  by decreasing the size of the particles from 2 j to 03 j barium sulphate showed an in crease of 100 lo in solubility and mercury oxide 300  over that of the normally saturated solu tions At the last meeting held the 29th of May Professor Lloyd read a paper bearing the title 67 Some Unscientific Reflections upon Science The paper was vigorously discussed some of those present thinking that the attitude of scien tific men had been unfairly portrayed while others supported Professor Lloyd This paper is soon to appear in full in SCIENCE At this meeting also Professor E D Campbell detailed in a highly interesting manner his researches on the microscopical and chemical composition of steel His paper gave a comparison of the heat of formation and the action of nitric acid and of iodine on cementite one of the constitu ents of high carbon steel and on the pure car bide of iron isolated from pearlite From these comparisons the author concludes that free cementite is not only not identical with the carbide bf pearlite as is usually assumed but is probably not a carbide at all but a solid solution of carbon in iron FREDERICK C NEWCOMBE Secretary THE TEXAS ACADEMY OF SCIENCE DURING the half year ending with June this organization held four meetings in the Chemical Lecture Room of the University of Texas On January 18 Dr William Morton Wheeler pro fessor of zoology in the University lectured upon The Relation of Ants to other Living Organisms on March 23 Dr William L Bray professor of botany lectured on Texas For ests their Present Condition and their Future Management and on April 5 Dr William B Phillips the lately appointed director of Uni versity Mineral Survey lectured on Texas Petroleum The lectures of Messrs Wheeler and Bray were illustrated by a liberal use of lantern slides The program of the annual meeting held on June 10 was as follows  Contributions of the Nineteenth Century to Education William S Suttdn MA professor of the science and art of education in the University of Texas Rice Irrigation in Texas Thos

chemistry University of Texas Professor Suttons paper was a thoughtful exposition of the subject Contributions of the Nineteenth Century to Education though necessarily brief The closing paragraph in the form of a summary was as follows  In con clusion let us consider for a moment the ques tion What is the significance of all these contri butions which the last one hundred years have made to education  Upon what principle can be explained the accomplishment of a task so stupendous as to involve first the most radical changes with respect to the aim in education second the vast expansion of the culturemate rial to accomplish this aim  third the discovery of scientific method in instruction fourth the provision for the professional training of teach ers fifth the organization and partial develop ment of gigantic systems of public instruction at public expense  sixth the increase of num ber of the learned professions by recognizing the digfity of applied sciences and lastly the extension of the privileges of education to the child in the kindergarten and to the parent in the home There can be but one answer to this questionit is the spirit of real humanism which is the distinctive characteristic of the nineteenth century a spirit which through the reign of reason seeks to bring all men to a knowledge of the truth and which has for its ultimate purpose the complete physical and spiritual enfranchisement of the human race Mr Thompson in discussing The Texas Railway Stock and Bond Law called attention to the fact that Texas is the only State in which the issuance of railway stocks and bonds is controlled by the government and also that it is the only one which has prescribed an absolute basis for the valuation of railway properties The Stock and Bond Law declares that the issuance and execution of all railway securities are special privileges  subject to the absolute control of the State and that no indebtedness shall be authorized beyond the reasonable value of property  to be fixed by the Railroad Commission in accordance with actual cost Railways existing at the time of passage of the law were valued at the estimated cost of repro duction The causes that led up to the enactment of the law were discussed and it was shown that the contention by investors in railway stocks and bonds that they should be entitled to charge freight and passenger rates sufficient to earn a fair rate of interest on their holdings and the support of the Courts in the matter led the State to limit the issuance of such securities and to absolutely prohibit the current practice of  watering stocks and bonds It was shown from the reports of the Rail road Commission that the average amount of stocks and bonds outstanding against the rail ways of Texas under the effect of this and other laws had been reduced from 43961 per mile in 1894 to 36926 per mile in 1900 As the Stock and Bond Law continues in effect this will be further reduced thus permitting a larger per cent of the net earnings to be used in the upbuilding of the roads and guaranteeing safer investments to the purchasers of railway securities Notwithstanding the restrictions of the law railway building in Texas is progress ing at a rapid ratebuilding for purely specu lative purposes is checked and legitimate con struction promoted In 1901 it is thought that Texas will easily lead the States of the Union in miles of new railway The following notes on the red oxide of mer cury were presented by Messrs Schoch and Wilcox  The yellow oxide of mercury has been care fully examined in the laboratory of the school of chemistry of the University of Texas with a view to clearing up disputed points By heat ing up to 200C and weighing the water evolved only 06  was obtained which invali dates the statements of Walker and Schaffner that the substance is mercuric hydroxidea statement made on the basis of results obtained by heating the substance in the open air and reporting the loss as water and corroborates the work of Siewert The substance is dis tinctly crystalline its specific gravity is 106 as determined by Mr J M Kfihne while that of the red oxide is 11 Upon the report of Messrs A M Ferguson 68 SCIENCEJULY 12 1901 SCIENCE and John K Prather tellers President Har per announced that the following persons had been duly elected officers of the Academy for the year 19011902 President Professor James C Nagle of the Agricultural and Me chanical College of Texas College Station VicePresident Dr Henry Winston Harper of the University of Texas Treasurer Mr R A Thompson Engineer to the State Railroad Com mission Secretary Dr Frederic W Simonds of the University of Texas Librarian Dr William L Bray of the University of Texas Other Members of the Council Hon Arthur Lefevre State Superintendent of Public In struction and Professors Taylor and Wheeler of the University FREDERIC W SIMONDS Secretary THE TORREY BOTANICAL CLUB AT the meeting of the Club on May 24 1901 the scientific program consisted of a paper by Dr H M Richards on The Botanical Estab lishments at Buitenzorg and Tjibodas in Java illustrated by numerous photographs including views of the entrance to the botanic garden and of species growing within of largelianas a foot in diameter of the nutmeg jackfruit etc of a tapioca plantation beautiful treefern groves with alsophilas 40 feet high etc Dr Richards described his journey by train from Batavia 40 miles to Buitenzorg among the foothills of the western mountains The Botanical Garden of Buitenzorg is at an elevation of over 900 feet and therefore much cooler than the coast low lands the thermometer rarely going below 80 or above 90 F rain falls almost every day and almost uniformly through the year the forenoon is bright and clear the conditions for plant growth are very much as in a hothouse A smoldering volcano rises on one side and an extinct one on the other with a very variable river between The history of the Garden dates from Sir Stamford Raffles British governor who made a picturesque park about 1811 about his palace of which the Garden shows some remnants The Rafflesia which perpetuates his name is but occasionally to be seen and although the Garden endeavors to maintain examples of growth none were to be had at the time of Dr Richards visit Since the present directorship about 1880 the Garden has been greatly stimu lated Dr Lotze formerly at the Johns Hop kins University is now one of the staff there The eight laboratory tables for foreign workers were well filled Much valuable work has been done of immediate agricultural utility it is here that the Cinchona was acclimated from South America to replace the coffee industry the coffee plants having been destroyed by a fungus Experiments toward finding a new rubber supply are in progress and others to im prove vanilla and cocaine production The Malay workmen who fertilize the vanilla plant by hand prove very skilful About 30 Euro peans and 200 natives form the garden force In the Botanical Garden proper the orders are not grown in exact sequence but are grouped and marked off by letters two specimens of each species are grown  one at least of these is labeled if grown away from its congeners that fact is indicated by use of a red label Many screwpines which belong to the salt or brackish water of the coast grow well here in the garden soil The palm collection is one of the largest in the world notable features are its specimens of Areca and of Livistona Down by a brook is a fine Casuarina collection the Javanese species of which forms large forests on the upper hills resembling northern larch forests The Ficus group is abundant and supplies the favorite shade tree for Javanese streets Orchids hang especially from trees of the leguminous type as Amherstia Caesalpinia etc These trees are very like candelabra in direction and so ex pose a reduced surface to the excess of light The mountaingarden at Tjibodas at an ele vation of about 4500 feet affords the neces sary complement to the botanical garden proper Dr Richards found it cool enough after the afternoon rain to make a fire very welcome Good potatoes are raised there and on the journey up one passes paddyfields and teaplantations including that from which came the Javanese villagers at the Chicago fair A great jungle of 700 acres extends up to the mountaintop through which the ascent was taken at 3 A M by torchlight to get the sunrise view Here tropical oaks develop 6970 SCIENCE into dense balls epiphyte ferns are in abun dance fallen trunks are covered with moss and the path through the jungle chokes up so quickly that it has to be cut open often The jungle is said to contain 1500 species of trees The Malays are very keen in perceiving dis tinctions and recognize two species of oaks there which the botanists have not yet dis criminated On the heights the aspect becomes more European Viola Ranunculus Primula Lonicera Lobelia Oxalis etc appear and Wallace explained this by supposing these northern forms were pushed south by a glacial climate and on the retreat of the ice they themselves retreated to the mountains EDWARD S BURGESS Secretary THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCE OF ST LOUIS AT the meeting of the Academy of Science of St Louis on the evening of June 3 22 per sons present the following subjects were pre sented A paper by Dr Gellert Alleman on The Action of Alcohol on Certain Isomeric Diazo Compounds and one by Dr G Hambach en titled A Revision of the Blastoidese were presented by title Mr Wmi H Roever of Washington Univer sity read a paper on  The Effect of the Earths Rotation upon Falling Bodies in which he showed that a body falling from a great height has a southward deviation in the northern hem isphere and a northward deviation in the south ern hemisphere The deviation is given by the formula L1  Kos2 2 1 Ksinpcoss f falls R the radius of the earth assumed spher ical p the

presented a number of speci mens collected at Eureka Mo He exhibited a large number of galls on hickory maple and oak leaves commenting on the remarkable va riety of the forms of galls made by the minute insects He had bred a good many of these in sects and found that in successive years a good many different forms came from these galls WILLIAM TRELEASE Recording Secretary CURRENT NOTES ON PHYSIOGRAPHY NEW MAP OF THE MISSISSIPPI THE Preliminary Map of the Mississippi River from the mouth of the Ohio River to the head of the Passes published by the Mississippi River Commission 18811885 32 sheets one inch to a mile is now to be supplemented by a new edition of which 13 sheets are issued bearing in red overprint the changes wrought by the river in about fifteen years These new sheets are without question the most in structive exhibition of river work quantita tively determined yet published in this coun try for a river of the first magnitude they have no rival in the world They deserve to be widely known not only among engineers for whom they were primarily constructed but among geographers and teachers to whom they convey much information The general be havior of the meandering river may be in ferred from the maps of the earlier edition from which it appears that the meander system slowly moves down the valley because the thread of fastest current thrown toward the outer side of every curve is therefore delivered to the downvalley side of every tangent or crossing so called because river boats must there cross the river obliquely in following the channel of greatest depth and that the mean der belt included between tangents drawn out side of the curves slowly widens as the curves increase in radius and arc until it here and there suddenly collapses when a curve is cut off It may be noted in passing that it is for this reason that the abandoned curvesthe oxbow lakesare frequently of larger radius than the average of the existing curves The

j100168,Harvard Law Review,1324400,Dower as Subject to Inheritance Tax,i256962,ally And since the interpretation which makes it impossible to waive a jury is due to an old conception no longer accepted the theory of public interest should be limited as closely as possible in its application DOWER AS SUBJECT TO INHERITANCE TAX  An important question in the construction of inheritance tax laws is whether dower comes within their scope A recent Tennessee decision holds that under a statute taxing property passing under the intestate laws dower is not taxable Crenshaw v Moore I37 S W 924 Tennl Illinois under an identical statute adopted the contrary rule2 In deciding the question as to what is covered by inheritance taxes the general intention of legislatures in passing such laws must be subordi nated to the meaning of the words used to express that intention The mere fact that the transfer of property occurs on the death of an in testate does not show that it passes under intestate laws The term intestate laws refers only to the laws governing intestate succes sion 3 Clearly all property of an intestate is not subject to the in heritance tax as for example that which is applied to the payment of the debts of the deceased for it is recognized by    courts generally that a tax of this character is not a tax on property as such but one upon the right of succession 4 Is dower a form of succession Its origin is probably to be found in an early Germanic custom of the husbands giving the wife a dos on marriage5 In Saxon times the widow was supported wholly out of the personal estate and not until the Norman conquest did dower in land arise Blackstone says that the reason our law adopted it was for the sustenance of the wife and the nurture and education of the younger children 6 The right has always been treated with the greatest solici tude until modern times7 and as far back as Magna Charta the widow was freed from the burden of fine and relief to which all heirs and alienees were subject8 This early special privilege marks a difference between inheritance and dower which is due to the complete lack of connection between dower and the rules of descent and in fact the widows estate is a temporary dislocation of these rules Furthermore before the hus bands death the right to dower although not vested9 is still a contin gent right of sufficient importance to be a subject of judicial protection10 1 The same conclusion has been reached under a code Succession of Marsal 118 La 2II And it has been so held with respect to curtesy In re

mentally inheritance or succession 12 are the terms applied to the devolu tion and distribution of the real and personal property of an estate 13 which remains after all liabilities have been settled14 Dower on the other hand is itself an obligation of the estate created by the law It is not part of the assets to be distributed and so important an obligation is it considered that it must be satisfied not only prior to the distribution but even in preference to the other debts of the deceasedl5 This finally must be conclusive proof that the widow is really a creditor and in no sense a distributee16 and hence that dower is not a form of successionl7 The above reasoning can be supported by an analogy It has been held that a homestead right    is not a right which vests under the law by succession It is a right bestowed by the beneficence of the law of this state for the benefit of the family 18 and hence is not subject to an inheritance taxl9 The same principle is equally applicable to the right of dower RECENT CASES ACCORD AND SATISFACTIONVALIDITY RETENTION OF SUM OFFERED AS FULL SETTLEMENT OF ANOTHERS DEBT The father of a debtor wrote to the creditor offering in full settlement of the debt an amount less than that of the debt and enclosing a draft for that amount The creditor cashed the draft and wrote that he had placed the sum on account Held that he cannot recover the balance from the debtor Punamchand v Temple I9II 2 K B 330 C A The principal case does not profess to alter the strict English rule as to the question of satisfaction by a third person but follows a dictum of Willes J in declaring that payment not technically satisfaction may bar further recovery by the creditor See Cook v Lister 13 C B N s 543 594 Yet in order to have that effect the payment must be received in full discharge of the debt It was formerly held by the Court of Appeal that whether or not a check or draft offered in full settlement was accepted as such is a question of fact to be decided by the trial judge or jury Day v McLea 22 Q B D 6o0 The principal case n Thorne v Cosand I60 Ind 566 67 N E 257 12 The words are practically synonymous according to moder use See

of the widow and the heir must be plain to every apprehension See Sutherland v Sutherland 69 Ill 481 486 This conclusion is not weakened when as in the prin cipal case there is a statute limiting the right of dower to those lands of which the husband died seised Such a statute in derogation of the common law cannot be held to change the nature of dower unless it expressly so provides It must be con fessed however that if both this statute and the Pennsylvania statute in note 15 were in effect in the same jurisdiction from an analytical point of view it would be hard to distinguish such an emasculated dower from a form of inheritance like the pars legitima of the Civil Law 18 See Estate of Moore 57 Cal 437 442 19 In re Kennedys Estate supra 182

tainous part of the state have completed forty nine square miles Mr Bodfishs division have finished altogether two hundred and twelve square miles in Massachusetts onehalf of which was partly done last year of the region around the District of Columbia thirtyfive square miles have been completed Mr Griswold has a very large party at work in northern Virginia who have completed seven hundred square miles the cen tral division under Mr Renshaw is getting under way Mr Davis is at work in central Arizona and has completed eight hundred square miles Mr Wilson is at work in the gold region around Ore ville in the gold belt with two topographical par ties and one triangulation party the topographical work covers three hundred and seventyseven square miles but both parties were retarded some what by bad weather Up to Aug 27 53 sheets of the general topographical atlas of the United States have been published there are 48 sheets in proof  The coastsurvey parties are now in the field busily engaged in pushing the work forward Two topographic parties and one hydrographic party are already at work on the resurvey of San Fran cisco Bay Owing to the very limited appropria tion for the Alaska work only 4000 being appro priated in lieu of 9000 asked for the steamers especially employed for this work at an expense of several hundred thousand dollars are to be imme diately called from the field there being no money to carry forward the necessary work for which an admirable plant had been provided Professor Davidson has returned from Portland Orewhere he was engaged in astronomic and magnetic work to San Francisco and has resumed his duties in charge of several parties on the Pacific coast The parties on the transcontinental arc are all at work except Assistant Eimbeck who would be in the field were it not for the lateness of the season which is inopportune for locating stations on the summit of the Rocky Mountains The telegraphic longitude parties are at Salt Lake and Ogden Sub assistant Marr is ordered from the magnetic obser vatory at Los Angeles to report for duty in tele graphic longitude work at Salt Lake The physical hydrography of Delaware bay and river has been completed as far as this years appropriation will carry it and Assistant Merinden is about to trans fer his party to New York bay and harbor where the work of last summer will be continued If progress is as rapid as it has been heretofore the resurvey of Long Island Sound will be completed i NWCE VOL VIII No 187 the present season Assistant Weir will take up the topographical work in the vicinity of Chathami Mass in connection with Professor Mitchells physical survey of Monomoy Shoals Mr F M Thorn superintendent of the coast survey who left Washington for Orchard park near Buffalo NY has returned to his official duties LETTERS TO THE EDITOR sCorrespondents are requested to be as brief as possible The writers name is in all cases required as prof of good faith Thumbmarks THE letter on thumbmarks in No 185 of Science recalls to mind an extract cut from a newspaper in March 1883 headed Thumb portraits The matter was taken from the World of wonders In it ref erence is made to the spiral grooves on the skin of the thumb with the remark that the figure on each thumb remains the same during life but the marks are different on each It then goes on to state  The Chinese take advantage of all this to identify their important criminals at least in some parts of the empire We photograph their faces  they take impressions from their thumbs These are stored away and if the delinquents should ever again fall into the hands of the police another impression at once affords the means of comparison The Chinese say that considering the alteration made in the countenance by hair and beard and the power many men have of distorting or altering the actual features etc their method affords even more certain and easy means of identification than our plan of taking the criminals portrait A year or more ago a gentleman of Cincinnati pro posed to take advantage of this fact and apply the thumbmark to railroad tickets to prevent their fall ing into the hands of scalpers He brought it to the attention of several railroad managers who thought favorably of it but meeting with considerable diffi culty in making arrangements to get the mark with out too great inconvenience to the purchaser and likewise I believe discovering that the process could not be patented it was given up At least I have not heard any thing of it lately JOSEPH F JAMES Miami university Oxford O Revivification It is well known by all zoologists that many ani mals such as tardigrades rotifers anguillulae and others are subject to revivification as Needham Spallanzani Doyere and others have shown Could some reader of Science tell me whether experiments of a similar nature have been performed in America on these same animals and let me know the name of the experimenters as well as the title date and place of publication of their papers  I would be also much obliged if any one could tell me whether the experiments have been performed on other animals of superior organization Lastly can some one give me information concerning Hindoo fakirs who it is said can fall into a state of trance and remain seemingly dead and in fact buried for a long time

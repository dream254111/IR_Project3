New York City Chairman Committee of Professional Ethics of the New York State Bar Association formerly Chairman of Committee on Grievances and Ethics American Bar Association  M ANY words in common use are hard to define Even lexi cographers fail in their task Witness the early dictionary which defined CAT a small domestic animal The word profession has for many AngloSaxon generations called up to mind medicine theology law These have been called the learned pro fessions Each of them in respect of its members imports training the possession of certain qualifications variously prescribed and an ordina tion vow a Hippocratic oath or an oath of office The state of which a lawyer ex virtute jurandi becomes an officer at least of its judicial branch professes to the public that he possesses certain qualifications of learning which are capable of being ascertained by official bar examiners and in favored locali ties he is also solemnly certified as are also bartenders and chiropodists as possessed of good character The attorney himself professes to such of the community as may employ him or call upon him for gratuitous service that he has capacity to assert and de fend their legal rights in the courts of justice or to counsel them correctly as to their rights and liabilities in their business relations Law is a double profession It has an objective and a subjective phase In its subjective aspect it possesses a life of the spirit a high and lofty ethic higher than the gentlemans no blesse oblige It is equivalent to the ordination vow of a priest in the temple of Justice It involves subjection to selfdenying ordinances and domina tion by a spirit of unselfish service How far below such a plane are those who would make it as well as call it a business a means of money making or of politicalpreferment alone In another connection the writer has outlined the threefold obligations of the lawyer in dealing with the question of the status of this profession in our social economy and shown that he has a triunity of duty to his client to the court and to the community THEORY OF THE UNIVERSAL RIGHT TO PRACTISE LAW It is assumed even in the most recent analysis of the subject 2 that in a democracy everyone has a right to enter any profession and that it is undemocratic to erect such barriers at 1 See Address in Hubbard Course on Legal Ethics Albany Law School 1905

layman It shows painstaking labor Its facts are ably marshaled But it illustrates the inadequacies of the grasp of a professional problem by a nonprofessional mind It has been well said by Mr Ringrose The errors of men who are not familiar with the practical working of legal institutions will be errors of detail The corollary is that pro fessional opinions often neglect first principles since the practice of an art is apt to obliterate from the mind the science on which its philosophy is founded The Inns of Court 1910 Hyacinth Ringrose  Mr Jessup was also formerly Professor of Law in New York University and has been since its organization a member of the Commit tee on Legal Ethics of the New York County Lawyers Association The Editor 16THE ETHICS OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION 17 the gate as may prevent or deter the average man from entering activities which are so closely related to the political interests and life of our respec tive communities To avoid this im plication the author Mr A Z Reed concludes that a unitary that is an undifferentiated bar not only cannot be made to work satisfactorily but cannot even be made to exist He also concludes that adequate profes sional tests cannot be provided to which all training schools shall con form and agrees that there must be types of lawyers produced by types of legal education We sup pose that students would again become as in the Roman days studioni juris vel jurisprudentiae NB vel  or They would either become mere practi tioners or rise to the foot hills of advocates or to the mountain tops of jurisconsultus or jurisperitus I do not believe it There will always be grades of lawyers but the English differentiation between barristers and solicitors is not one to be made here by statute but by natural selectionand the profession once awakened will see to it that the right to enter it shall be so standardized as effectually to exclude from its privileges the com pletely incompetent individuals who under our present haphazard and uncoordinated systems of bar exami nations can enter its priesthood in a state maintaining low standards and migrate later under our ridiculous rules of democratic comity into the bar of a state having high standards At any rate we have this theory of the universal right to practise law It has even entered into the decisions of the highest tribunal of our country The Supreme Court of the United States has observed It is undoubtedly the right of every citizen of the United States to follow any lawful calling business or profession he may choose But the Court most wisely continues subject only to such restrictions as are imposed upon all persons of like age sex and condition 3 Fortunately in many of our states certain intellec tual standards and in some qualifica tions of character are erected and exacted to which the applicant for admission to this particular profession must conform It is after all the personal equation that counts and it is the exceptional man who enters a learned profession Theoretically he should have a vocation to the law as he is expected to have to the ministry As St Paul said Woe is me if I preach not the Gospel and the ideal lawyer should be under the similar constraint of an allelseexcluding vo cation Otherwise he will soon find his level Mr Wigmore had this in mind when he styled the profession a priesthood of Justice I The exhaustive research into the history of the profession into the na ture and extent of its organization and the association of its members into bodies more or less selfgoverning and intended to impact upon the commu nity by collective action embodied in Bulletin Number Fifteen above re ferred to makes one regret that the superficial character of its conclusions though based upon more or less ade quate premises warrants the stricture upon it in Dean Stones elaborate analysis of that Bulletin This is broadly to the effect that it seems to recognize that while a firstclass law school is requisite for the production of a firstclass lawyer a secondclass law school has a raison detre in order to meet the democratic need for second class lawyers This reminds us of the farmer who cut in his barn door a large hole for the large cat and a small hole  19 U S 114 4 Introduction to Ethics of the Legal Profession by Orrin H Carter 1915 318 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY for the kitten If the only object is to give access to the barn it would be more economical and make a better looking door if no cutting of holes was done at all and the door was left open for cat and kitten alike Either may if occasion arise be chased out by the owner of the barn 5 THE NATURE OF THE PROFESSION The word profession has been defined substantially again by the Supreme Court of the United States and I venture to paraphrase its lan guage as a vocation involving rela tions to the affairs of others of such nature as to require for its proper conduct an equipment of learning or skill or both and to warrant the community in making restrictions in respect to its exercise And when such restrictions are embodied in statutes of the state or in rules of court and the appropriate authority certifies A to be a member of the bar of that particular state it holds him out as already hinted above to the community as possessing the qualifications contem plated by the statute or by the rules7 On the other hand any lawyer possess ing a certificate to practise in the su preme court of his state in a particular federal court or in the Supreme Court of the United States holds himself out as possessing qualifications of efficient service to those members of the com munity whom he is there to serve The fundamental underlying ele ment therefore of professional life is this idea of an efficient skilled service The assumption in Bulletin Number Fifteen that under our democratic institutions the right to enter any profession is an inalienable right must be taken with a grain of the salt of commonsense Our records are full of descriptions of the respect or lack of respect in which lawyers have been held in the beginnings of all democratic communities The experience has been that the trial has been made over and over again of getting along without lawyers They have even been pro hibited by law Our colonies were at the outset peculiarly the victims of this misconception and false theory But it soon became obvious that not only must lawyers be recognized as important factors in the community but that bad lawyers must be repressed and suppressed and therefore that standards must be erected to which all lawyers must conform At first an oath was deemed all sufficient It is a sad commentary upon the profession itself that it took a century before the American bar as a whole came to the consciousness of the fact that it must in addition to such oath erect standards or canons of ethics that it must publish those standards to the community at large so that men could know not only what they could expect of lawyers but what lawyers were expecting of one another and what the courts could require of them And it has taken nearly a generation since this formulation of canons was first mooted for the courts themselves to depart from the narrow precedents of former decisions which tended to restrict their power over lawyers to penal lines that is to say lawyers were to be disbarred only if they had broken the statute of the state forbidding the doing of some particular thing But now judicial decisions east and west are beginning to embody recognition by the judges of the fact that when a member of the bar indulges in indecent solicitation of business or undignified advertisement I But see Mr Reeds rejoinder just published American Bar Association Journal February 1922 p 114 6 Paraphrased from United States v Laws 163 U S a58 7 In re Bergeron 220 Mass 472THE ETHICS OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION 19 of his wares or in other breaches of our canons the courts will assume that such a lawyer may be censured sus pended or disbarred for violation of the canons in force in the profession We have thank God reached the stage when a lawyer must respect the essential dignity of the profession as well as the Mosaic Decalogue and the penal law of his state Nevertheless the idea persists and it is endorsed by men of high repute and standing and this is very hard to understand that because of our demo cratic institutions and because of this inalienable right to practise law if one can secure the necessary state certificate and because the law is a socialservice profession then since efficiency is the keynote of today the law and its practice must be conducted on the basis of efficiency that it is after all a business and a money making business and that it would be idle for the lawyer to compete with other lawyers without the same pru dent and diligent use of business methods of hustling  of advertising price fixing etc which the ordinarily reasonable and active business man uses in the transaction of his business affairs Mr Julius Henry Cohen rendered a great service to the profession by his book Is Law a Business or a Pro fession 1916 Banks Law Publish ing Company in which he has traced the preparedness for ethical standards and has discussed and tabulated data as to admissions and disbarments up to 1915 in the State of New York qv COMPENSATION FOR EXERCISE OF SKILL NOT TO BE REGULATED Passing one step farther it is obvious that members of a profession devoted to service and under our institutions entitled to compensation for such serv ice ought not if we consider the liberty of the individual alone to be regulated in respect to compensation for such service It has been said by them of old time Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the straw  and The laborer is worthy of his hire Yet this matter is a matter of common concern Doctors have their scale of charges for office or housevisits but surgeons outside of occasional agitation of the subject reserve the right to fix their own fees for special operations requiring a maximum of preparation education practice and skill And so in the law while as many lawyers render gratui tous service to poor clients as do physicians to needy patients neverthe less in small communities where everyone knows everyone else it is not infrequent to find the establishment of a socalled fee bill or agreed regula tion of minimum charges so that no lawyer can undercut his competitors The theory of this however remains that in proper cases and under special circumstances the individual lawyer is not to be limited to the minimum fixed by such tariff table These two elements the profession of a given degree of skill and the right to charge for the exercise of that skill underlie the obligation to the client and give rise to cause of action against the lawyer for malpractice that is to say upon demonstration of the fact that by reason of his not possessing the proper skill he has failed to perform his contract of efficient service to his client whereby his client has been damaged the lawyer may be held responsible for damages as may the doctor for improper medical care or surgical treatment ORGANIZATIONS AMONG LAWYERS Before discussing the nature and extent of the standards which the collective bar may promulgate as the20 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY norms of conduct to which all its members must conform under penalty of exclusion from the privileges and dignities of professional life just a word as to organizations of lawyers It is impossible here to set forth the number and type of organizations and their jurisdiction of the standards for admission to membership financial support etc throughout the forty eight states of the Union8 Great de tail in this respect is contained in Bulletin Number Fifteen prepared with meticulous care over a period of eight years For the purpose of this survey it is sufficient to say that the American Bar Association with a membership of 14111 in August 1991 represents in one sense the aristocracy of the American bar It is however an aristocracy to which any lawyer of good standing may be admitted re gardless of his estate because the dues are nominal 6 a year Its meetings are held once a year most of its work is done by conferences of its sections or by committees devoting an enormous amount of ad interim time to the examination of problems that are re ferred to them and in spite of all the criticisms made upon this body as not being really representative of all the associations it impacts upon the community in many decisive ways In three respects alone it has justified its existence First in the activity of its Committee on Uniform State Laws1 Second in the very fact that it has promulgated canons of ethics which have been adopted by the bar associa tions of nearly all of our states The adoption of these canons by state and even by county bar associations the printing of such canons and the ex hibition of them in court houses and other public places for the information of the other members of the community the recognition of such standards by the courts in disbarment proceedings or in actions against lawyers for im proper or negligent conduct have spread the interest in ethical standards over the entire country and in partic ular have resulted in the adoption of such canons by other organizations of professional men The third respect in which this Association has justified its existence has been in its convening at the time of its own meetings representatives of all the bar associations willing to send such delegates from the different states thus forming a nexus between or shall we say a clearing house for the local and the national associations Such combining of associations in the discussion and settlement of great questions has led notably for in stance to such gatherings as the Con ference of Bar Association Delegates recently held in Washington February 2324 1922 on the subject of Legal Education attended by nearly four hundred delegates representing over one hundred bar associations and presided over at its different ses sions by the Chief Justice of the United States and by Mr Elihu Root whose titles of eminence as a law yer are numerically too many to be tabulated the conclusions of which Conference have now become a matter 8 See article by Mr Harley page 33 9See Bulletin Number Fifteen Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching entitled Training for the Public Professor of the Law 1921 Pp 57111 See also the Sixteenth Annual Report of the Carnegie Foundation 10 See Report of that committee in Year Book of the Association for the last ten years tabulat ing the number of

the courts state and federal issued by that committeeTHE ETHICS OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION q1 of public knowledge interest and record 12 MODIFICATIONS IN ADOPTION OF CANONS OF ETHICS Nevertheless here and there in the different associations the canons of the American Bar Association have seemed to be counsels of perfection In one respect or in another local associa tions have modified some particular canon Some of them are reluctant to visit with the weight of displeasure even to the extent of mere censure one who solicits business or one who advertises in certain modified fash ions Others are hostile to the con tingent fee however regulated Thus the American bar as a whole lacks uniformity a in respect to its stand ards as aforesaid b in respect to their enforcement in disciplinary proceed ings In this second respect a con tributing cause is the almost inex cusable mental attitude of many judges charged with the duty of dis barring Witness for example the answer of a Kansas judge to the ques tionnaire issued by the Committee on Ethics of the American Bar Associa tion to the different judges of the country when asked as to disbarment proceedings in his court He stated that there had been one case where a lawyer had embezzled the funds of his client and that the court had suspended proceedings on condition that he should leave the state And then he added  But I have since been informed that he has removed to Wichita and is practising there3 Others as above indicated insist upon proof of violation of some penal statute before they will disbar a man still others consider that mere restitution at the pistol point of disbarment proceedings to the com plaining client should rehabilitate the man in the confidence of the profession the bench the client and the com munity We must add to this situation the attitude of the local associations by which I mean the county bar associa tions which in an experience extend ing over a number of years in connection with the Committee on Grievances and the Committee on Legal Ethics of the American Bar Association and like committees of the New York State Bar Association I have found pecul iarly unwilling to bring fellow members to the bar of justice They will resort to great and laborious efforts at ne gotiation and settlement of the particu lar controversy that brings that man before them for discipline and I might generalize by saying that in 90 per cent of the cases a liberal coat of whitewash is administered to the attorney com plained of upon his agreeing not to do it again The confidence in the profession due to popular knowledge that it has canons of ethics is more than destroyed by the discovery that the canons are but brutum fulmen A notable exception to this situation must be recorded in the case of certain associations that have organized them selves for the purpose of keeping the local bar clean and have appropriated liberal amounts to pay salaried attorneys who devote themselves es pecially to the task of receiving sifting and if necessary presenting complaints to the appropriate court and securing the determination of that court That has been peculiarly true in the case of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York of the New York County Lawyers Association of the Kings County Bar Association in Brooklyn and of the Chicago Bar Association Every reader can supplement this list 12 Readers interested in this can write to Mr Shippen Lewis of the Philadelphia Bar who was secretary of this conference 13 See also Journal American Judicature Society June 1920 on Sanitation of the Bar in Pennsyl vania22 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY or find exceptions to it from his knowl edge of his own community THE BAR AND THE ELECTION OF JUDGES To what extent does the local bar become active and exert a real and effective influence in the nomination and election of judges How perfectly true in this connec tion are the words of Emory Washburn in his famous lectures on The Study and Practice of the Law delivered at Harvard that the lawyer is not only a member of a profession but a member of the community Yet the answers to the questionnaire of the American Bar Association revealed the fact that in most districts it is not considered the thing for the bar as a collective body to butt into politics and it seems to be assumed that the furthest extent it is dignified and proper to go is to have committees appointed to examine into the qualifications of the nominees of the respective political parties after they have been selected and to report on their fitness for the bench This is usually to act too late It certainly would seem that the in fluence should be exerted farther back that the bar is best fitted to judge as to what one of its members or more is qualified by education and tempera ment for the judicial office and if need be to force such nominations upon the local political organizations The fact remains that the reports made by committees on judicial nomi nations even when given the publicity that they are by the press in such a center say as New York City fail to impact upon the consciousness of the large majority of voters who do not read the papers in which these reports are given publicity and who would not pay much attention to them if they did Allowing for differences of polit ical conviction opinion and affiliation is it conceivable that the influence of two bar associations having an aggre gate membership of six or seven thousand out of the ten or twelve thousand lawyers in a particular polit ical unit if exerted directly upon organizations that is upon the persons who after all in spite of direct primary laws and various ballot reforms con trol nominations in the various parties capable of electing a candidate would be without its effect and could fail to insure high standards in the qualifica tions of those nominated and elected to judicial office When one rereads that great argu ment of Rufus Choate made before the Massachusetts Constitutional Con vention in which he argues for the appointment of judges as distinct from their election by popular vote one has to marvel indeed at the high standards of dignity impartiality and efficiency nevertheless manifested by the elective judiciary of our great municipal cen ters In spite of petty grievances disappointed litigants and charges of political subcellar influence the cases of complaints against judges before bar associations or in impeachment pro ceedings are gratifyingly few both in states where the judiciary is appointed and in those where it is a political office to be grasped at CLEANING THE AUGEAN STABLES It is impossible to give a statistical survey of the number of trials and convictions for violation of ethical standards covering the various states of the Union A tabulation of them would cover many pages and in the character of the penalties imposed to distinguish illegal from immoral or unethical acts would require a volume in itself Anyone interested in any particular state has only to ask some legal friend to communicate with the grievance committee of that statesTHE ETHICS OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION 23 bar association to secure such data The fact is probably the same in all the states that conviction of a penal offense operates to disbar a lawyer that nevertheless it is usually neces sary to inform the appropriate tribunal of the fact of his conviction and have his name stricken from the roll The question has arisen from time to time whether a pardon for the offense automatically reinstates the attorney In my opinion it does not but applica tion must be made for such reinstate ment If the offender so pardoned should practise without such formal reinstatement he is liable to further discipline and prosecution The vio lation of penal laws without actual conviction is sufficient proof of obli quity of moral character to warrant any court in disbarring It is when we come to the finer shades of lack of ethical perception that grievance committees find difficulty sometimes in persuading the courts to act with sufficient firmness In the appendix to this volume appear canons of ethics not only of the American Bar Association but of the Commercial Law League of America The path of the collection lawyer towards ethical purity has been an arduous climb The trouble has been to differentiate be tween collection agencies and their attorneys It has aroused vehement discussion of the propriety of the division of any professional fee with a layman which has been criticized as affording a cloak whereby a lawyer by incorporating a collection agency can resort to means of solicitation of busi ness in which the corporation having no soul is free to indulge and from which he reaps the harvest or agrees to divide his fees in order to secure the employment A notable contribution to the wel fare of the profession generally and to this branch of it in particular was made when the New York County Lawyers Association in a conference which lasted months at which these practices were discussed withrepresen tatives of the commercial lawyers finally in its notable answer to Ques tion No 47 laid down certain rules or principles governing the conduct of such attorneys Ignorance of ethical standards on the part of a very large number of members of the bar whose business is small and of whose income collections afford the fundamental was shown in the reports of one of the conferences of this Commercial Law League held at Atlantic City One member it seems said he had heard so much about ethics  at that meeting that he decided he would try to find out what it meant so he asked his waiter at the Chalfonte Sam do you know what this word ethics means I reckon I do replied Sam What is it asked the inquiring member and Sam said Just about the same as that word etiquette which tells you there is certain things you mustnt do if any body is looking This incident pitifully illustrates the absolute necessity of having bench and bar alike ingrained with the con viction that these standards of ethical conduct are norms to which all lawyers must conform whether the lawyer is a general practitioner a collection law yer a patentlawyer a negligence lawyer or a corporation lawyer Spe cialization releases from no obligation This is not to say however that every lawyer violating any canon must be disbarred There are many cases where a lawyer through zeal or ignorance offends against the essential dignity of the profession but being brought to book and censured may be sufficient ly shocked into appreciation of the stan d ards to remain or become a useful member of the community24 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY EXTENSION OF IDEA OF OBLIGATION FOR PUBLIC SERVICE Whatever the temporary criticism of the profession in popular estimation may be the fact is that all really critical observers of our social conditions have recorded their conviction as did De Tocqueville when he said for example that the influence which members of the legal profession exercise in the government is the most powerful existing security against the excesses of democracy In another sentence he refers to the bar as the most powerful if not the only counterpoise to the democratic element A simi lar conviction is registered in the appeal which is made to the New York State Bar Association in support of an In ternational Bar Association organized in Japan by Dr Rokuichiro Masujima exPresident of that Association Hon orary Member of the New York State Bar Association Barrister at Law of the Middle Temple as well as an honored member of the Japanese bar His contention is that the combined influence of lawyers all over the world devoted to the principles of the com mon law should be a guaranty in the human family that principles of com mon justice will through their influence leaven the political world St Paul in his great summary of the Christian martyrs began his appendix with the words Time would fail me to tell of Barakand of Gideon and similarly to call the roll of members of the American bar who have dominated the public affairs of our nation would be to make of this publication an encyclopaedia of names This fundamental idea of public service is expressed by Shakespeare himself in As You Like It We all recall the line When labor sweats for duty not for meed In many of the lectures delivered on the Hubbard Foundation at the Albany Law School on the subject of Legal Ethics one distinguished speaker after another has emphasized the fact that the great lawyer is not the man who enters the profession as a means to acquire a fortune He must enter it as we have noted above as a voca tion with the idea of rendering service He must have the spirit of Lincoln as contrasted with the spirit of Webster great advocate though he was for even in the Girard Will case when Webster could secure no present re fresher or retainer he exacted a con tingent fee agreement4 NEED FOR PROPAGANDA Bearing these considerations in mind there is no question but that there must be propaganda When the canons of the American Bar Association had not yet been adopted by the Associa tion or having been adopted had not yet been endorsed or adopted by vari ous state associations there was a great deal of discussion and propa ganda In the City of New York law yers interested in this matter not only conducted this propaganda in legal magazines and in the public prints but volunteered and were actually ap pointed to deliver addresses on the subject at various Y M C A centers in the Phipps Settlement in Cooper Union and other public places under the general title of  What the Ordinary Citizen Is Entitled to Expect and Exact of His Lawyer in the Way of Fidelity Honesty Diligence etc The late General Thomas H Hub bard by gift in his lifetime established a lectureship or foundation at Albany Law School to which every year one or more speakers of influence is ap pointed to indoctrinate the students of 14 A copy of this was furnished by me to and published by the New York Law Journal some years agoTHE ETHICS OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION 95 that particular school in respect to ethical standards This example might well be followed in other schools A determined effort has been made by committees of ethics in different states to see to it that either by persuasion or by the compulsion of rules of court law schools expecting their certificate of graduation to be accepted by bar examiners as the equivalent of a clerk ship or prescribed years of study should prescribe and faithfully carry out a certain number of hours of lec tures upon the subject of legal ethics Dean Costigan endeavored to fill this need He made an exhaustive ex amination of the sources of the stand ards or traditions showing the growth of the rules governing conduct be coming a member of the bar and collated with that the answers to questions given out by the New York County Lawyers Committee the clin ical reports of which have a circulation all over the world and have in but one or two instances occasioned adverse com ment or complaint This treatise 15 contains a most fascinating history of the entire subject Obviously this matter is intimately and vitally con nected with the nature of legal educa tion And it is surprising that those who come in contact with the eager youth who are looking forward to qualifying for this great social service so often prove impatient of the sugges tion that their teaching should have this moral side line or of the more ex treme requirement that the ethical viewpoint should underlie all their instruction as to the methods and practice of the law One Dean replied to a letter from me in this regard that he had no cure for souls What a pedagogic heresy Every teacher has the fashioning or at least the polishing of a soul In order to summarize this discussion the following is submitted as a redac tion to fundamental principles of the thirtytwo canons of the American Bar Association A DECALOGUE OF THE PROFESSIONAL OBLIGATIONS OF THE LAWYER 1 As an officer sworn to uphold the Constitution and to the proper enforcement of the law the lawyer should by his conduct and counsel exemplify the lawabiding spirit and refrain even in his private life from anything contrary to the spirit of the moral and statute law 2 In his relation to the courts the lawyer should in his conduct maintain their dignity by respectful address by punctilious discharge of all forensic duty and by abstaining from all attempts to curry favor or from the appearance even of using personal relations to secure professional ad vantage 3 In his relations to clients the lawyers duty arises from the confidence reposed in his learning or ability for which he is to be paid Therefore a In the conduct of unliti gated business he owes a scrupu lous fidelity to the clients highest interest and must seek no ad vantage or profit to himself out side of his reasonable compensa tion b In advising litigation he must be guided by his own or counsels judgment of the law applicable to the points in issue He should never countenance by acceptance of a retainer unjust useless or oppressive suits or consent to the interposition of merely dilatory false or sham defenses c In actual litigation he may use all procedure provided by law appropriate to the protection of 16 Cases on Legal Ethics in the American Case Book Series 1917 West Publishing Co68 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY his clients interests he must be alert and diligent in prosecution vigilant and careful in defense refrain from any attempt to de ceive a court or jury be courteous to his fellow lawyers and obliging in matters not inconsistent with his clients rights 4 The lawyer must not violate his clients confidence unless in a proper case compelled so to do under oath He must not use knowledge so gained to his clients undoing or disadvantage and if entrusted with money or prop erty he is in the highest degree a trustee and liable professionally for any failure to administer the trust reposed in him with scrupulous fidelity and capacity 5 The lawyer is always entitled to his reasonable compensation this may be contracted for with the client pro vided no advantage be taken of his ignorance or necessities Contingent fees where not unconscionable in amount are proper if the client desire such form of compensation But in all cases he must avoid even the ap pearance of champerty or maintenance 6 A lawyer employed for or as signed to the defense of one accused of crime is even though apprised of his guilt bound by his duty to ensure a fair trial and to prevent conviction save pursuant to the law in that case made and provided 7 The lawyer should not solicit or permit others to solicit for him any professional employment No di vision of fees or agreement therefor is proper except with fellow lawyers based on a division of service Self advertisement is commercial in spirit and tends to lower the sense of profes sional dignity 8 In his relation to the community of which he is a citizen the lawyer occupies a position of peculiar responsi bility His respect for the law and the courts in which it should be adminis tered should make him fearless to expose and attack any breach of judicial integrity So also he must be vigilant to assist in purging the bar of unworthy members He should be quick to attack any abuse of process of law or any invasion of the rights to life and liberty guaranteed to all by the Constitution 9 If invested with public office he is bound to a higher efficiency of service by reason of his knowledge of the law If he serves as a District Attorney he represents the people of the state He is sworn to enforce the law but cannot stoop to oppression or injusticesuch as the suppression of evidence or the secreting of witnesses who might tend to establish the innocence of one he is prosecuting 10 If elevated to the bench his obligations become intensified In the discharge of his judicial duties he should be studious patient thorough punctual just and impartial cour teous and fearless regardless of public clamor or private influence CANONS OF JUDICIAL ETHICS Since judges are under our form of government a part of the gov ernmental power and sworn to uphold the Constitution and chosen to inter pret apply and enforce existing laws it is clear that their ethical obligations are greater than those of their brethren at the bar from whom they have been thus set apart These latter have a primary duty to a client opposed to the client of another in interest and this duty modifies at times their duties to the court and to the community A committee of the American Bar Association recently appointed of which the Chief Justice of the United States it is believed is to be the chair man are to engage in the task ofTHE ETHICS OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION 27 formulating canons for the judiciary16 That task will require time for its performance For the purposes of this symposium however the following may be prof fered as a nucleus for elaboration A PROPOSAL FOR AN ETHICAL DECA LOGUE FOR JUDICIARY I Having sworn to uphold the Con stitution and being charged with the solemn task of administering justice among his fellow citizens under the law the judge should be juris peritus learned in the letter and spirit of the Constitution and of the statutes en acted in conformity therewithand should keep himself constantly informed and in touch with the social develop ment of the community he is to serve in order that he may adequately apply that learning to the varying needs that emerge in the controversies submitted to him for arbitrament II To learning he must add impar tiality He must not respect persons in judgment In holding the scales of Justice he must not allow personal or political hostility on the one hand or friendships or prejudice on the other to weigh in either balance Whether the parties before him are friends or foes or whether they be known to him or unknown he must be blind to consid erations other than those constituting or arising from their respective rights or obligations under the law III Whatever the degree of his learning and impartiality he must in the highest degree possess and preserve a character free of reproach Himself a priest in the Temple of Justice he must scrupulously observe the morali ties and obey the laws as a citizen and not arrogate to himself any right to be above them or free from their common operation IV His judicial character presup poses absolute integrity He should be honest in his personal dealings and must not put himself under pecu niary obligations before his election or subsequently to those who may appear before his court His service is a selfdenying ordi nance and he should abstain from even the appearance of the evil of profiting by information secured ex virtute offcii to speculate or invest on the strength of his knowledge thus acquired 16 Since writing this article the author has received a letter from Mr Charles A Boston Chairman of the Committee on Professional Ethics of the New York County Lawyers Association the following excerpts of which will be of interest to the general reader In response to your recent request that I contribute something to the forthcoming number of the Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science it seems to me that any contribution by me at this time other than is contained in this letter would be premature because the subject of the formulation of Canons of Judicial Ethics by the American Bar Associa tion to supplement the Canons of Ethics ap proved by it in 1908 has been referred by the Executive Committee of that Association to a Special Committee which will take the matter under consideration and I do not feel that I can properly anticipate the action of that Committee I was recently advised by the President of the American Bar Association that he had designated for membership on the Committee Chief Justice Taft exSenator George Suther land of Utah and myself and that two vacancies remained to be filled from members of the judiciary I do not think it amiss however to say that Mr Everett V Abbot of this City and myself jointly contributed an article on The Judiciary and the Administration of the Law to the American Law Review for JulyAugust 1911 from which I quote the following suggestions in respect to Canons of Judicial Ethics  They should clearly and concisely make it known that the judge should so administer the law in the settlement of controversies as to show that he appreciates his position as honor able of itself and honorably to be maintained that his conduct should uniformly be that of a gentleman and an officer and for the good of the service that he should be ever conscious of his responsibilities attentive to his duties28 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY He shall do everything for justice nothing for himself V Whether his office be appointive or elective he should not be swayed in judgment by hopes or fears regarding the continuity of his official service In making appointments in aid of the administration of justice such as appointments of receivers referees special guardians appraisers and the like he must on the one hand avoid nepotism and on the other not sur render his duty of selection to any political or other dictator Those whom he selects act in his place and stead in relieving his judicial time and he is responsible for their integ rity fidelity and industry as for his own VI Charged with the duty of acting as a check in the interests of the people against aggressions or usurpations of power by either executive or legislative branches of the government he should be fearless to assert his power irrespec tive of the apprehended effect of an tagonisms and hostilities thus engen dered But here also he must be impartial and sustain if need be these coequal agencies of government in the proper use of powers constitutionally bestowed upon either VII He must not allow his judg ment to be swayed by the magnitude or smallness of the litigants interest or by the insignificance or prominence of his advocate Intent on ascertain ing the truth and reaching an adequate and just decision he must not fear to protect a party before him from the ignorance or negligence of his own attorney or neglect adequately to guide and instruct juries in the exer cise of their peculiar functions VIII He must wear the ermine with dignity As the incarnation of justice he must when discharging his judicial functions be free from temper though he may indulge in righteous indignation if perjury be attempted by witnesses or if counsel seek to deceive or mislead the court or jury He owes to the people punctuality at whatever cost of personal inconven ience calmness patience and forbear ance lest he be diverted from the issues to be resolvedcourtesy to all before himalertness to testimony and argu ment since inattention is the highest discourtesy is a thief of time and an earmark of inefficiency He must cultivate a capacity for quick decision Habits of indecision must be sedulously overcome He must not delay by slothfulness of mind or body the judgment to which a party is entitled IX To be learned to be honest to be fair and to be no respecter of persons is still not enough He must be believed such and so possess the perfect confi dence of the community In such case he may preserve and enjoy his personal intimacies and friendships unimpaired He may achieve the affection of the bar and the respect of the public and en joy that loving veneration which the Book of Job records as the meed of the upright judge assiduous in their performance and avoid delay as far as possible that he should be scrupulous to free himself from all improper influences and from all appearance of being improperly or corruptly influenced that he should be studi ously regardful of the rights of litigants that he should be an independent and representative citizen rather than a partisan that he should use the necessary patronage of his office as a public trust and that in the selection of referees receivers or other judicial appointees he should conscientiously appoint only men known to him to be of integrity and fitness for the duty assigned and if he is permitted to practice at the bar or to prosecute private business he should not permit such matters to interfere with the prompt and proper performance of his judicial duties  17 Rufus Choates added to the quoted words Nothing for his friend nothing for his patron nothing for his sovereign99 X None the less is he a citizen and bound to share the common burden of responsibility for the purity of the common weal He must not shirk a proper perfor mance of such duties nor hide behind the judicial gown in times of revolt against oppression or corruption or in crises of social change His life must be personally politically and judicially teres atque rotundus CONCLUSIONS In that remarkable book seeking to voice the desire of England for a higher and more spiritualized life the author of The Glass of Fashion has embodied that ideal which must permeate every profession that identifies the moralities of that profession with the very charac ter of the being of the man who pro fesses it His illustration of the ex pectation of honesty from those who serve him by even a Bolshevik of the most criminal type illustrates the fundamental idea of what the com munity expects of a man of character and no man has a right even in a democracy to belong to a learned or skilled profession who has not the fundamentals of high character which may be expected to develop into fullness by the very experiences of his service What conclusions are we to draw I That in any democracy whether loosely organized or highly articulated public servants must in theory be controlled by lofty standards of duty II That the people are entitled to know what those standards are and where there are none to prescribe them III That conformity to those stand ards must be enforceable in a proper tribunal IV That it is to the highest interest of the profession itself that every case of violation of its ethical standards be investigated and all offenders dealt with lest the res publica suffer V That the courts when unspurred by a bar of high ideals have failed adequately to regulate professional conduct and therefore the bar must be so organized as to be selfdisciplinary And this even at the risk of appearing to become an aristocracy or an un democratic guild VI That judges as well as lawyers are to conform their conduct to even more exacting ethical standards

the customary manner and a list with some abstracts is given below The Torrey Botanical Club gave by invi tation a special memorial program in honor of Dr John Torrey in the Museum of the lNew York Botanical Garden on Wednes day June 27th The principal features of the day were  Reminiscences of Dr Torrey DR T C PORTER  Work of Dr Torrey as a botanist  DR N L BRITTON Historical sketch of the

Club The sectional committee had concluded arrangements with the Council of the Botan ical Society of America by which the proSCIENCE this subject which proclaims itself as  scien tific  must expect severe scrutiny Mr Drahms would have been well advised and would have served better the cause of sci ence had he been content like some French prison chaplains to set down a brief and simple record of

JulySeptember 1900 is of unusual interest almost the entire field of anthropology being covered by the ten articles which comprise the principal part of its 200 pages In his paper on Obsidian Mines of Hidalgo Mexico Professor W H Holmes of the National Museum describes the process em ployed by the natives in obtaining obsidian during the centuries necessary to produce the flakage so thickly covering hundreds of acres on the mountain slopes one heap alone being estimated to contain twenty or thirty thousand cubic feet of this artificially flaked material The process of flaking is also described and il lustrated A complementary article  The Ob sidian Razor of the Aztecs by Dr George Grant MacCurdy of Yale University describes and explains the distinguishing features of obsidian fracture and shows thatto them is due in a measure at least the excellence of obsidian as a material for knife and razor making Early last spring Dr J Walter Fewkes of the Bureau of American Ethnology made an examination of some remarkable but littleknown cavate and pueblo ruins the l1atter still standing several feet in height northeast of Flagstaff Arizona and he also conducted some excavations therein The results of these observations are now ex ploited with several excellent views and groundplan drawings under the title Pueblo Ruins near Flagstaff Arizona Judging from 611 the character of the houses the pottery and other art products and his knowledge of the traditions of the Hopi Indians the author is in clined to attribute these nowruined pueblos to that tribe An excellent article by Mrs Alice Carter Cook is devoted to The Aborigines of the Canary Islands based on information ob tained from personal observation in the archi pelago and intimate acquaintance with the early Spanish literature of the subject Every phase of the life of the people is described and type pictures of the inhabitants and their curi ous dwellings are given Still another corner of the world is treated in Mr R H Mathews paper on The Wombya Organization of the Australian Aborigines in which various un usual customs are also set forth Dr Swan M Burnett presents a scholarly essay on  Giuseppe MazziniIdealist A Chapter in the Evolution of Social Science in which is given some por tions of the great reformers labors with the underlying principles for which he contended with such courage and persistency as have rarely been equalled in the history of human endeavor A Grammatic Sketch of the Ca tawba Language  of South Carolina is given by Dr A S Gatschet This almost extinct tongue belongs to the Siouan stock and but few exam ples of it have ever been published Mr Gerard Fowke whose wide experience in archeologic investigation of the Mississippi drainage area and his familiarity with the supposed Norse re mains in Massachusetts first discovered and described by the late Professor E W Horsford and later by his daughter Miss Cornelia Hors ford make his study of the  Points of Differ ence between Norse Remains and Indian Works most closely resembling them  of double inter est Mr Harlan I Smith of the American Museum of Natural History presents the de tails of his  Archeological Investigations on the North Pacific Coast in 1899 conducted under the auspices of the Jesup Expedition and H Newell Wardle discusses the interesting  Sedna Cycle  of the Eskimo which sheds new light on the mythology of the most northerly inhabitants of the globe The usual Book Reviews discus sion of Periodical Literature and Notes and News complete the number G P Put nams Sons Publishers New York OCTOBER 19 1900 N S VOL XII No 303 BUT two articles of the October Monist are technically scientific in character The first is by Professor A S Packard of Brown Univer sity and gives for the first time in actual trans lations a complete statement of Lamarcks views on the origin and evolution of man and of his thoughts on morals and on the relation between science and religion Professor Pack ard believes that Lamarcks attempt at explain ing the probable origin of man from some arboreal creature allied to the apes is more de tailed and comprehensive than that offered by Darwin in his  Descent of Man which was vir tually anticipated by Lamarck The second arti cle by Professor Arnold Emch of the University of Colorado treats of the Mathematical Prin ciples of Esthetic Forms Starting from the physiological conditions for the perception of esthetic forms the author proceeds to investi gate the abstract law of symmetry as embodied in the principle of the group projective and perspective transformation inversion etc showing for example that the principle of repe tition finds its mathematical expression in the geometry of the group and explaining also why the various species of geometrical transforma tion do not destroy the impressions of axial and central symmetry The remaining articles are 1 an essay on modern Biblical criticism by Professor Paul Schwartzkopff entitled The

held on Mon day October 1st at 12 West 31st Street Professor E R Von Nardroff presented a paper  On the Application of Fizeaus Method to the Determination of the Velocity of Sound with an experimental illustration He used sound of very short wave length beyond the limits of hearing The sound was detected by means of a sensitive flame He overcame the effect of irregular disturbing reflected and dif fracted waves by using sound of considerable intensity and a flame only slightly sensitive The sound after passing between the teeth of a rapidly revolving wheel fell on a concave spherical mirror made of wood some distance away and was reflected back through the teeth at the opposite end of a diameter of the wheel and came to a focus on a sensitive flame just be hind the wheel The author gave a neat dem onstration of the working of the apparatus and showed with great ease how with increasing speed of the revolving wheel the flame was al ternately shielded from and exposed to the sound The slightest disturbance of the ad justment of the mirror threw the focus away from the flame in a marked manner He stated that the method could probably not be used to compete with other accurate methods hereto fore used but it supplied a beautiful illustra tion of Fizeaus method of measuring the ve locity of light Professor J K Rees gave an interesting ac count of some of the scientific instruments at the Paris Exhibition The great telescope was not yet finished although this fact was not yet generally known and it was impossible to tell yet whether it was to be a success The Ger man exhibit was superb The Germans had a 612 SCIENCE

June 21 II On the Chemical and Mineralogical Composition of the Dhurmsalla Meteoric Stone By the Rev SAMUEIL HATUGHTON MD FRS Fellow of Trinity College Dubliln Received June 6 1866 On the 14th July 1860 at 215 PM a remarkable meteoric stone fell at Dhurmsalla in the Puinjab a small specimeni of which was forwarded to the Geological Museum of Trinity College which I have analyzed with the results contained in the following paper The direction of the motion of the meteorite was ascertained to be from NNW to SSE The cold of the fragments that fell was so intense as to benumb the hands of the coolies who picked them up but who were obliged in conse quence of their coldness instantly to drop them The specific gravity of the Trinity College specimen was found as follows Weight in air  3335 4 grs Weight in water 23541  Spgr 4 e 4   s  3399 The stone is grey closegrained and splintery in fracture alnd presents fewer specks of metallic iron anid magnetic pyrites than usual and was coated with the ordilnary black pellicle on its outer side From 100 grs acted on with iodine which dissolved the alloy of iron and nickel there were obtained of peroxide of iron 9 85 grs and of protoxide of nickel 1 96 gr The portion insoluble in iodine was next acted on by dilute muriatic acid and evaporated to dryness at 212 then moistened with muriatic acid and filtered by which process it was divided into a soluble and insoluble portion the portion left on the filter was boiled with carbonate of soda so as to dissolve the free silica which was found to be 18 95 grs This was added to the portion originally soluble in muriatic acid so as to give the following results grs Silica 18 95 Alumina 0   014 Present originally as Peroxide of iron   1 11 I protoxide and proto I sulphuret of iron

silicate of magnesia and iron represented by the formula 3RO SiG in which magnesia preponderates greatly over the iron The 383 grs of mineral insoluble in muriatic acid and in carbonate of soda were now divided into two equal portions of which one was fluxed with carbonates of soda and potash and the other with lime and chloride of ammoniumwith the following results grs Silica   1085 Alumina

American practice there has been no esprit de corpseach factor in commerce striving for itself regardless of and often to the dis paragement of the others disdaining moreover the slower and securer methods of developing business for the quicker way of doubtful tenure The chief grievance of commerce is against the financial element which when disposed to assist at all usually favors its newly created agencies or affiliated interests ignoring and losing the invaluable experience acquired by older and established organ izations COLOMBIA BY EDWARD H MASON Glencoe Illinois While the needs for capital in Colombia in the near future are not materially different from what they have been in the years just prior to the European war there has been a great change in the method and direction of getting these needs satisfied Heretofore on account of a variety of reasons which need not be dwelt on here the Colombian capital seeker usually went to the European market and the American capitalist on his side seemed quite willing to have these applications pass on to London or the continent Now the realization that the United States is the prin cipal source of supply still open to the partly developed countries of South but more especially the interested and sympathetic treat ment given Colombian projects here instead of the perfunctory consideration of a few years ago has turned their capital seekers decidedly to this market For convenience we may divide Colombias capital needs into those of the national government the departments or states the cities and those of private concerns The national government needs capital primarily to finance the substitution of a gold secured currency for the present nonredeemable paper money system After this the great need of the country is for capital for the con struction of public works and of these the national government considers of first importance the improvement and sanitation of some important seaports This work the government will probably handle direct and finance it with its own securities The extension of existing railroad lines and the building of some others in the development of a general plan for a national railway system make the next great need for capital and the national government although directly interested by reason of its railway subsidies and its rights of reversion in the various properties when the periods of 171THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY their concessions have expired may here limit its activities to co6perating with the existing private companies or as in the case of two concessions for needed railways authorized lately may offer them first to the departments in which the lines are located and departmental loans will have to be sought to carry through the work Up to recent years no attempt has been made by the larger cities of Colombia to finance their growing needs by the issuance of municipal bonds and their public improvements have been of very slow growth in consequence The last few years however have seen a great change in public opinion in this respect and a number of the larger cities are realizing the necessity of putting in adequate modern water service with proper sewerage and street paving are planning to build or are acquiring their street railway systems and will be in the market for the necessary financing for these improve ments As regards capital for private uses the lack of straight banking capital in Colombia is a great handicap to the country and there is much need of capital for longterm mortgage loans on city and farm property At present banking capital is limited and discount rates very high This limits commercial enterprise and is prohibitive for real estate loans as is also the fact that it is difficult to secure any thing but shortterm accommodations Loans on real estate at any thing like reasonable rates and for longer terms would stimulate building operations of a much needed character in the cities and would enable many a cattle raiser to better his stock or to put some of his big grazing tracts to a more profitable use COSTA RICA BY WALTER PARKER General Manager New Orleans Association of Commerce Chairman Permanent Committee on Costa Rica Pan American Financial Conference An abundance of water power undeveloped mines of great wealth agricultural possibilities of wonderful potentiality and adequate shipping facilities should enable Costa Rica to assume a mortgage far beyond the power of the average Central American republic The natural wealth of the republic has hardly been touched The effect of the European war is similiar to that felt by the other republics One of the results is the hastily formed Banco Internacional founded by the government to meet the unusual financial conditions created This is a bank of issue having a capital consisting of Costa Rican treasury bonds The reserve 172

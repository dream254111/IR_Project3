J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,106754,OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS ON THE LIGHT OF BODIES IN A STATE OF COMBUSTION BY THE REV MR MORGAN COMMUNICATED BY THE REV RICHARD PRICE LLD FRS,I206942,190 XI OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS ON THE LIGHT OF BODIES IN A STATE OF COMBUSTION BY THE REV MR MORGAN COMMUNICATED BY THE REV RICHARD PRICE LLD FRS READ JANUARY 27 1785 THE DISCUSSION WHICH I NOW WISH TO LAY BEFORE THE ROYAL SOCIETY IS NOTHING MORE THAN A SERIES OF FACTS AND OF CONCLUSIONS WHICH SEEM TO FLOW FROM THOSE FACTS AND FROM AN ATTENTION TO THE FOLLOWING DATA I THAT LIGHT IS A BODY AND LIKE ALL OTHER BODIES SUBJECT TO THE LAWS OF ATTRACTION II THAT LIGHT IS AN HETEROGENEOUS BODY AND THAT THE SAME ATTRACTIVE POWER OPERATES WITH DIFFERENT DEGREES OF FORCE ON ITS DIFFERENT PARTS III THAT THE LIGHT WHICH ESCAPES FROM COMBUSTIBLES WHEN DECOMPOSED BY HEAT OR BY ANY OTHER MEANS WAS PREVIOUS TO ITS ESCAPE A COMPONENT PART OF THOSE SUBSTANCES IT IS AN OBVIOUS CONCLUSION FROM THESE DATA THAT WHEN THE ATTRACTIVE FORCE BY WHICH THE SEVERAL RAYS OF LIGHT ARE ATTACHED TO A BODY IS WEAKENED SOME OF THOSE RAYS WILL ESCAPEMR MORGANS OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS C 191 ESCAPE SOONER THAN OTHERS THOSE WHICH ARE UNITED WITH THE LEAST DEGREE OF POWER WILL ESCAPE FIRST AND THOSE WHICH ADHERE TO IT MOST STRONGLY WILL IF I MAY BE ALLOWED THE EXPRESSION BE THE LAST TO QUIT THEIR BASIS WE MAY HERE HAVE RECOURSE TO A FAMILIAR FACT WHICH IS ANALOGOUS TO THIS AND WILL ILLUSTRATE IT IF A MIXTURE CONSISTING OF EQUAL PARTS OF WATER OF SPIRITS OF WINE AND OF OTHER MORE FIXED BODIES BE PLACED OVER A FIRE THE FIRST INFLUENCE OF THAT HEAT TO WHICH ALL THE IN GREDIENTS ARE ALIKE EXPOSED WILL CARRY OFF THE SPIRITS OF WINE ONLY THE NEXT WILL CARRY OFF THE SPIRITS OF WINE BLENDED WITH PARTICLES OF WATER A STILL GREATER DEGREE OF HEAT WILL BLEND WITH THE VAPOUR WHICH ESCAPES A PART OF THE MORE FIXED BODIES TILL AT LENGTH WHAT EVAPORATES WILL BE A MIXTURE OF ALL THE INGREDIENTS WHICH WERE AT FIRST EXPOSED TO THE FIRE IN LIKE MANNER WHEN THE SURFACE OF A COMBUSTIBLE IS IN A STATE OF DECOMPOSITION THOSE PARTS WHICH ARE THE LEAST FIXED OR WHICH ARE UNITED TO IT WITH THE LEAST FORCE WILL BE SEPARATED FIRST AMONGST THESE THE INDIGO RAYS OF LIGHT WILL MAKE THE EARLIEST APPEARANCE BY INCREASING THE HEAT WE SHALL MIX THE VIOLET WITH THE INDIGO BY INCREASING IT STILL MORE WE SHALL ADD THE BLUE AND THE GREEN TO THE MIXTURE TILL AT LENGTH WE REACH THAT INTENSITY OF HEAT WHICH WILL CAUSE ALL THE RAYS TO ESCAPE AT THE SAME INSTANT AND MAKE THE FLAME OF A COMBUSTIBLE PERFECTLY WHITE IT IS NOT MY PRESENT DESIGN TO SHEW WHY THE MOST REFRANGIBLE RAYS ARE THE FIRST WHICH ESCAPE FROM A BURNING BODY BUT TO ENUMERATE THE SEVERAL FACTS WHICH SEEM TO SHEW THAT SUCH A GENERAL LAW TAKES PLACE IN COMBUSTION AND THAT THE VARIOUS COLOURS OF BODIES IN THIS STATE ARE UNIFORMLY REGULATED BY THAT DECREASE OF ATTRACTIVE FORCE NOW DESCRIBED BY192 MR MORGANS OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS ON BY EXAMINING THE FLAME OF A COMMON CANDLE WE MAY OB SERVE THAT ITS LOWEST EXTREMITIES OR THE PART IN WHICH THE BLACK COLOUR OF THE WICK TERMINATES DISCHARGES THE LEAST HEAT AND THAT AS THE VERTEX OF THE FLAME IS APPROACHED A SUCCESSIVE ORDER OF PARTS IS PASSED THROUGH IN WHICH THE LOWEST IS CONTINUALLY ADDING TO THE HEAT OF WHAT IS JUST ABOVE IT TILL WE COME TO THE TOP OF THE FLAME NEAR WHICH ALL THE HEAT IS COLLECTED INTO A FOCUS AT THE LOWEST EXTREMITY HOWEVER WHERE THE HEAT IS INCONSIDERABLE A BLUE COLOUR MAY BE ALWAYS OBSERVED AND FROM THIS APPEARANCE AMONGST OTHERS IT MAY I THINK BE SAFELY CONCLUDED THAT THE BLUE RAYS ARE SOME OF THOSE WHICH ESCAPE FROM COMBUSTIBLES IN AN EARLY PERIOD OF THEIR DECOMPO SITION AND THAT IF THE DECOMPOSITION COULD BE EXAMINED IN A PERIOD STILL MORE EARLY THE COLOUR OF THEIR FLAME WOULD BE VIOLET BY AN A PRIORI DEDUCTION OF THIS KIND I WAS LED TO WATCH THE APPEARANCES OF A CANDLE MORE ATTENTIVELY WHENCE I FOUND THAT TO THE EXTERNAL BOUNDARY OF A COMMON CANDLE IS ANNEXED A FILAMENT OF LIGHT WHICH IF PROPER CARE BE TAKEN TO PREVENT THE ESCAPE OF TOO MUCH SMOKE WILL APPEAR MOST BEAUTIFULLY COLOURED WITH THE VIOLET AND INDIGO RAYS TO THE PRECEDING INSTANCE OF A COMMON CANDLE MANY FACTS MAY BE ADDED WHICH SPEAK A SIMILAR LANGUAGE IF SULPHUR OR AETHER IS BURNED OR ANY OF THOSE COMBUSTIBLES WHOSE VAPOUR IS KINDLED IN A SMALL DEGREE OF HEAT A BLUE FLAME WILL APPEAR WHICH IF EXAMINED BY THE PRISM WILL BE FOUND TO CONSIST OF THE VIOLET THE INDIGO THE BLUE AND SOMETIMES A SMALL QUANTITY OF THE GREEN RAYS THE BEST MODE HOWEVER OF SHEWING THE ESCAPE OF SOME RAYS BY THAT DEGREE OF HEAT WHICH WILL NOT SEPARATE OTHERS TILL INCREASED IS THE FOLLOWING GIVE A PIECE OF BROWN PAPER A SPHERICAL FORM BY PRESSING IT UPONTHE LIGHT OF BODIES IN A STATE OF COMBUSTION 193 UPON ANY HARD GLOBULAR SUBSTANCE GRADUALLY BRING THE PAPER THUS FORMED TO THAT DISTANCE FROM THE CANDLE AT WHICH IT WILL BE GIN TO TAKE FIRE IN THIS CASE A BEAUTIFUL BLUE FLAME MAY BE SEEN HANGING AS IT WERE BY THE PAPER TILL A HOLE IS MADE IN IT WHEN THE FLAME OWING TO THE INCREASED ACTION OF THE AIR UPON ALL PARTS OF IT BECOMES WHITE THOUGH THE EDGES STILL CONTINUE OF A BLUE OR VIOLET COLOUR AS A CONFIRMATION OF WHAT I HAVE CONCLUDED FROM THE PRECEDING FACTS IT MAY BE OBSERVED THAT THE VERY FLAME WHICH WHEN EXPOSED TO A CERTAIN DEGREE OF HEAT EMITTED THE MOST REFRANGIBLE RAYS ONLY WILL IF EXPOSED TO A GREATER DEGREE OF HEAT EMIT SUCH AS ARE LESS REFRANGIBLE THE FLAMES OF SULPHUR SPIRITS OF WINE C WHEN SUDDENLY EXPOSED TO THE HEAT OF A REVERBERATORY CHANGE THEIR BLUE AP PEARANCE FOR THAT WHICH IS PERFECTLY WHITE BUT TO GAIN A MORE STRIKING DIVERSITY OF THIS FACT I ADOPTED MR MELVILLS MODE OF EXAMINING BODIES WHILST ON FIRE I DARKENED MY ROOM AND PLACED BETWEEN MY EYE AND THE COMBUSTIBLE A SHEET OF PASTEBOARD IN THE CENTER OF WHICH I MADE A SMALL PERFORA TION AS THE LIGHT OF THE BURNING BODY ESCAPED THROUGH THIS PERFORATION I EXAMINED IT WITH A PRISM AND OBSERVED THE FOL LOWING APPEARANCES WHEN THE SPIRITS OF WINE WERE SET ON FIRE ALL THE RAYS APPEARED IN THE PERFORATION BUT THE VIOLET THE BLUE AND THE GREEN IN THE GREATEST ABUNDANCE WHEN THE COMBUSTION OF THE SPIRITS WAS CHECKED BY THROWING SOME SAL AMMONIAC INTO THE MIXTURE THE RED RAYS DISAPPEARED BUT WHEN BY THE LONG CONTINUANCE OF THE FLAME THE SAL AMMONIAC WAS RENDERED SO HOT AS TO INCREASE RATHER THAN DIMINISH THE COMBUSTION THE RED RAYS AGAIN APPEARED AT THE PERFORATION IF THE SCREEN WAS MANAGED SO THAT THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE FLAME MIGHT BE EXAMINED SEPARATELY I ALWAYS OBSERVED THAT VOL LXXV C C THE194 MR MORGANS OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS ON THE COLOURS VARIED ACCORDING TO THE DEGREE OF HEAT AT THE BASE OF THE FLAME OR WHERE THE HEAT WAS LEAST THE IN DIGO THE VIOLET AND A VERY SMALL TINGE OF THE BLUE AND GREEN APPEARED AS I APPROACHED THE VERTEX OF THE FLAME THE RAYS WHICH ESCAPED BECAME MORE AND MORE NUMEROUS TILL I REACHED THE TOP WHEN ALL THE RAYS APPEARED IN THE PRISM IT SHOULD BE ATTENDED TO THAT WHEN THE RED RAYS FIRST MADE THEIR APPEARANCE THEIR QUANTITY WAS SMALL AND GRADUALLY INCREASED AS THE EYE IN ITS EXAMINATION APPROACHED THAT PART WHERE THE HEAT WAS GREATEST MR MELVILL WHEN HE MADE SOME OF THE PRECEDING EXPERIMENTS OBSERVED THAT THE YELLOW RAYS FREQUENTLY ESCAPED IN THE GREATEST ABUNDANCE BUT THIS SIN GULARITY PROCEEDED FROM SOME CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH ESCAPED HIS ATTENTION IN CONSEQUENCE OF MIXING ACIDS OR SALTS WITH THE BURNING SPIRITS A VERY DENSE FUME OF UNIGNITED PARTICLES ARISES AND BEFORE THE RAYS OF THE BURNING BODY ARRIVE AT THE PERFORA TION WHERE THE PRISM CATCHES THEM THEY MUST PASS THROUGH A MEDIUM WHICH WILL ABSORB A GREAT PART OF THE INDIGO AND THE VIOLET ON THE OTHER HAND OWING TO THE IMPERFECTION OF THE DECOMPOSITION VERY FEW OF THE RED RAYS ARE SEPARATED FROM THEIR BASIS AND CONSEQUENTLY THE YELLOW AND THE ORANGE RAYS ARE THOSE ALONE WHICH PASS THROUGH THE UNBURNT SMOKE OF THE FLAME I WOULD NOW PROCEED WITH OBSERVING THAT BESIDES THE IN CREASE OR DECREASE OF HEAT THERE ARE OTHER MODES OF RETARDING OR ACCELERATING THE COMBUSTION OF BODIES BY WHICH ALSO MAY BE EXAMINED SOME OF THE PRECEDING ILLUSTRATIONS 1 A CANDLE BURNS MOST RAPIDLY AND BRILLIANTLY IN DEPHLO GISTICATED AIR 2 THETHE LIGHT OF BODIES IN A STATE OF COMBUSTION 195 2 THE BLUE COLOUR OF A SULPHUREOUS FLAME IN PURE AIR IS CHANGED INTO A DAZZLING WHITE 3 THE FLAME OF INFLAMMABLE AIR WHEN MIXED WITH NI TROUS AIR IS GREEN IT IS WHITE STRONGLY TINGED WITH THE INDIGO AND VIOLET WHEN MIXED WITH COMMON AIR BUT WHEN MIXED WITH DEPHLOGISTICATED AIR OR SURROUNDED BY IT THE BRILLIANCY OF ITS FLAME IS MOST SINGULARLY BEAUTIFUL IF THE PRECEDING FACTS PROVE THAT LIGHT AS AN HETEROGENEOUS BODY IS GRADUALLY DECOMPOSED DURING COMBUSTION IF THEY PROVE LIKEWISE THAT THE INDIGO RAYS ESCAPE WITH THE LEAST HEAT AND THE RED WITH THE GREATEST I THINK WE MAY RATIONALLY AC COUNT FOR SEVERAL SINGULARITIES IN THE COLOURS OF DIFFERENT FLAMES IF A PIECE OF PAPER IMPREGNATED WITH A SOLUTION OF COPPER IN THE NITROUS ACID BE SET ON FIRE THE BOTTOM AND SIDES OF THE FLAME ARE ALWAYS TINGED WITH GREEN NOW THIS FLAME IS EVI DENTLY IN THAT WEAK STATE OF DECOMPOSITION IN WHICH THE MOST REFRANGIBLE RAYS ESCAPE IN THE GREATEST ABUNDANCE BUT OF THESE RAYS THE GREEN ESCAPE MOST PLENTIFULLY THROUGH THE UNIGNITED VAPOUR AND THAT PORTION OF THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH SEPARATES THE EYE FROM THE FLAME THE PECULIARITY WHICH I HAVE NOW ENDEA VOURED TO ACCOUNT FOR MAY BE OBSERVED IN THE GREATEST PERFECTION IN BRASS FOUNDERIES THE HEAT IN THIS INSTANCE THOUGH VERY STRONG IS SCARCELY ADEQUATE TO THE DECOMPOSITION OF THE METALLIC VAPOUR WHICH ESCAPES FROM THE MELTED BRASS A VERY SINGULAR FLAME THEREFORE APPEARS TO THE EYE FOR WHILE ITS EDGES ARE GREEN ITS BODY IS SUCH AS TO GIVE THE OBJECTS AROUND A VERY PALLID OR GHASTLY APPEARANCE WHICH IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF ITS WANTING THAT PORTION OF RED RAYS WHICH IS NECESSARY TO MAKE A PERFECT WHITE C C 2 THE196 MR MORGANS OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS ON THE MOST SINGULAR PHAENOMENON ATTENDING A BURNING BODY IS PERHAPS THE RED APPEARANCE IT ASSUMES IN ITS LAST STAGE OF COMBUSTION THE PRECEDING FACTS AND OBSERVATIONS MAY I THINK HELP US TO EXPLAIN IT 1 AFTER A BODY HAS CONTINUED TO BURN FOR SOME TIME ITS EXTERNAL SURFACE IS TO BE REGARDED AS HAVING LOST A GREAT PORTION IF NOT THE WHOLE OF THOSE RAYS WHICH THE FIRST APPLICATION OF HEAT WAS ABLE TO SEPARATE BUT THESE RAYS WERE THE INDIGO THE VIOLET THE BLUE AND PERHAPS THE GREEN NOTHING THEREFORE WILL REMAIN TO BE SEPARATED BUT THE YELLOW THE ORANGE AND THE RED CONSEQUENTLY THE COMBUSTION OF THE BODY IN ITS LAST STATE OF DE COMPOSITION CAN ASSUME NO OTHER THAN A REDDISH APPEARANCE BUT 2 LET US CONSIDER THE EXTERNAL SURFACE OF THE COMBUSTIBLE AS ANNEXED TO AN INNER SURFACE WHICH MAY BE PARTLY BUT NOT SO PERFECTLY DECOMPOSED AS ITSELF FOR THE VIOLENCE OF THE HEAT WILL BE FOUND TO LESSEN IN ITS EFFECTS THE NEARER IT APPROACHES TO THE CENTER OF THE SUBSTANCE WHICH IS EXPOSED TO IT HENCE WE ARE TO CONSIDER THE PARTS WHICH ARE JUST COVERED BY THE EXTERNAL SUR FACE AS HAVING LOST LESS OF THEIR COMPONENT LIGHT THAN THE EXTER NAL SURFACE ITSELF OR THE FORMER MAY RETAIN THE GREEN RAYS WHEN THE LATTER HAS LOST BOTH INDIGO VIOLET BLUE AND GREEN 3 THOSE PARTS WHICH ARE NEARER THE CENTER OF THE BODY THAN EITHER OF THE PRECEDING MUST AS THEY ARE FURTHER FROM THE GREATEST VIOLENCE OF THE HEAT HAVE LOST PROPORTIONABLY FEWER OF THEIR RAYS OR WHILE THE MORE EXTERNAL PARTS MAY HAVE LOST ALL BUT THE RED THESE MAY HAVE LOST ONLY THE INDIGO AND VIOLET 4 THE MOST CENTRAL PARTS MAY BE UNAFFECTED BY THE HEAT AND WHENEVER THE FIRE DOES REACH THESE PARTS THEY WILL IMME DIATELY DISCHARGE THEIR INDIGO RAYS AND BE DECOMPOSED IN THE GRADUALTHE LIGHT OF BODIES IN A STATE OF COMBUSTION 197 GRADUAL MANNER WHICH I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED A PIECE OF ROTTEN WOOD WHILST BURNING WILL EXEMPLIFY AND CONFIRM THE PRECEDING ILLUSTRATION WHEN INFLUENCED BY THE EXTERNAL AIR ONLY IF EXAMINED THROUGH A PRISM NO RAYS WILL BE FOUND TO ESCAPE BUT THE ORANGE AND THE RED BY BLOWING UPON THE BURNING WOOD WITH A PAIR OF BELLOWS THE COMBUSTION BEING INCREASED WILL AFFECT THOSE INTERNAL PARTS OF THE BODY WHICH WERE NOT ACTED UPON BEFORE THESE PARTS THEREFORE WILL BEGIN TO LOSE THEIR LIGHT AND A PRISM WILL SHEW THE GREEN THE BLUE THE VIOLET AND INDIGO ALL APPEARING IN SUC CESSION APPEARANCES SIMILAR TO THE PRECEDING MAY BE OB SERVED IN A COMMON KITCHEN FIRE WHEN IT IS FAINTEST ITS COLOUR IS MOST RED THE OTHER RAYS HAVING BEEN EMITTED AND THE COMBUSTION AT A STAND BUT BY BLOWING UPON IT IN THIS STATE ITS BRIGHTNESS WILL BE INCREASED AND MORE AND MORE OF THE RAYS WHICH ARE YIELDED BY THE INTERNAL PARTS OF THE BODY WILL COME TO THE EYE TILL AT LENGTH BY CONTINUING TO BLOW THE COMBUSTION WILL BE MADE SO COMPLETE AS TO YIELD ALL THE RAYS OR TO MAKE IT APPEAR PERFECTLY WHITE MANY ARE THE VARIETIES DISCOVERABLE IN THE FLAMES AND IN THE APPEARANCES OF FIXED BURNING BODIES TO WHICH THE PRECEDING OBSERVATIONS MAY BE APPLIED BUT TO AVOID UNNECESSARY AMPLIFI CATION I WILL TAKE NOTICE ONLY OF WHAT APPEARS TO ME AN IMPER FECTION IN SIR ISAAC NEWTONS DEFINITION OF FLAME HE CON JECTURES THAT IT MAY BE A VAPOUR HEATED REDHOT I THINK I SHOULD RATHER SAY THAT FLAME IS AN INSTANCE OF COMBUSTION WHOSE COLOUR WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE DEGREE OF DECOMPOSI TION WHICH TAKES PLACE IF IT BE VERY IMPERFECT THE MOST REFRANGIBLE RAYS ONLY WILL APPEAR IF IT BE VERY PERFECT ALL THE RAYS WILL APPEAR AND ITS FLAME WILL BE BRILLIANT IN PROPORTION198 MR MORGANS OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS ON PROPORTION TO THIS PERFECTION THERE ARE FLAMES HOWEVER WHICH CONSIST OF BURNING PARTICLES WHOSE RAYS HAVE PARTLY ESCAPED BEFORE THEY ASCENDED IN THE FORM OF VAPOUR SUCH WOULD BE THE FLAME OF A REDHOT COAL IF EXPOSED TO SUCH A HEAT AS WOULD GRADUALLY DISPERSE IT INTO VAPOUR WHEN THE FIRE IS VERY LOW UNDER THE FURNACE OF AN IRON FOUNDERY AT THE UPPER ORIFICE OF THE CHIMNEY A RED FLAME OF THIS KIND MAY BE SEEN WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM THE FLAME THAT APPEARS IMMEDIATELY AFTER FRESH COALS HAVE BEEN THROWN UPON THE FIRE FOR IN CONSE QUENCE OF ADDING SUCH A SUPPLY TO THE BURNING FUEL A VAST COLUMN OF SMOKE ASCENDS AND FORMS A MEDIUM SO THICK AS TO ABSORB MOST OF THE RAYS EXCEPTING THE RED EXPERIMENTS ON ELECTRIC LIGHT IF WE WOULD WISH TO PROCURE ANY DEGREE OF CERTAINTY IN ANY HYPOTHESIS WHICH WE MAY FORM CONCERNING ELECTRICAL LIGHT PERHAPS THE FOLLOWING GENERAL DEDUCTIONS MAY BE OF SOME SER VICE TO US 1 THERE IS NO FLUID OR SOLID BODY IN ITS PASSAGE THROUGH WHICH THE ELECTRIC FLUID MAY NOT BE MADE LUMINOUS IN WATER SPIRITS OIL ANIMAL FLUIDS OF ALL KINDS THE DISCHARGE OF A LEY DEN PHIAL OF ALMOST ANY SIZE WILL APPEAR VERY SPLENDID PRO VIDED WE TAKE CARE TO PLACE THEM IN THE CIRCUIT SO THAT THE FLUID MAY NOT PASS THROUGH TOO GREAT A QUANTITY OF THEM MY GENERAL METHOD IS TO PLACE THE FLUID ON WHICH I MEAN TO MAKE THE EXPERIMENT IN A TUBE THREEQUARTERS OF AN INCH IN DIAMETER AND FOUR INCHES LONG I STOP UP THE ORIFICES OF THE TUBE WITH TWO CORKS THROUGH WHICH I PUSH TWO POINTED WIRES SO THAT THE POINTS MAY APPROACH WITHIN ONEEIGHTH OF AN INCH TO EACH 2 OTHERTHE LIGHT OF BODIES IN A STATE OF COMBUSTION 199 OTHER THE FLUID IN PASSING THROUGH THE INTERVAL WHICH SEPA RATES THE WIRES IS ALWAYS LUMINOUS IF A FORCE BE USED SUFFI CIENTLY STRONG I SHOULD OBSERVE THAT THE GLASS TUBE IF NOT VERY THICK ALWAYS BREAKS WHEN THIS EXPERIMENT SUCCEEDS TO MAKE THE PASSAGE OF THE FLUID LUMINOUS IN THE ACIDS THEY MUST BE PLACED IN CAPILLARY TUBES AND TWO WIRES INTRODUCED AS IN THE PRECEDING EXPERIMENT WHOSE POINTS SHALL BE VERY NEAR EACH OTHER IT IS A WELL KNOWN FACT THAT THE DISCHARGE OF A SMALL LEYDEN PHIAL IN PASSING OVER A STRIP OF GOLD SILVER OR DUTCH METAL LEAF WILL APPEAR VERY LUMINOUS BY CONVEYING THE CON TENTS OF A JAR MEASURING TWO GALLONS OVER A STRIP OF GOLD LEAF ONEEIGHTH OF AN INCH IN DIAMETER AND A YARD LONG I HAVE FREQUENTLY GIVEN THE WHOLE A DAZZLING BRIGHTNESS I CANNOT SAY THAT A MUCH GREATER LENGTH MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN MADE VERY SPLENDID NOR CAN I DETERMINE TO WHAT LENGTH THE FORCE OF A BATTERY MIGHT BE MADE LUMINOUS IN THIS MANNER WE MAY GIVE THIS EXPERIMENT A CURIOUS DIVERSITY BY LAYING THE GOLD OR SILVER LEAF ON A PIECE OF GLASS AND THEN PLACING THE GLASS IN WATER FOR THE WHOLE GOLD LEAF WILL APPEAR MOST BRIL LIANTLY LUMINOUS IN THE WATER BY EXPOSING IT THUS CIRCUM STANCED TO THE EXPLOSION OF A BATTERY 2 THE DIFFICULTY OF MAKING ANY QUANTITY OF THE ELECTRICAL FLUID LUMINOUS IN ANY BODY INCREASES AS THE CONDUCTING POWER OF THAT BODY INCREASES EXP I IN ORDER TO MAKE THE CONTENTS OF A JAR LUMINOUS IN BOILING WATER A MUCH HIGHER CHARGE IS NECESSARY THAN WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO MAKE IT LUMINOUS IN COLD WATER WHICH IS UNI VERSALLY ALLOWED TO BE THE WORST CONDUCTOR EXP II I HAVE VARIOUS REASONS FOR BELIEVING THE ACIDS TO BE VERY GOOD CONDUCTORS IF THEREFORE INTO A TUBE FILLED WITH WATER AND CIRCUMSTANCED AS I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED A FEW DROPS200 MR MORGANS OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS ON DROPS OF EITHER OF THE MINERAL ACIDS ARE POURED IT WILL BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE THE FLUID LUMINOUS IN ITS PASSAGE THROUGH THE TUBE EXP III IF A STRING WHOSE DIAMETER IS ONEEIGHTH OF AN INCH AND WHOSE LENGTH IS SIX OR EIGHT INCHES IS MOISTENED WITH WATER THE CONTENTS OF A JAR WILL PASS THROUGH IT LUMINOUSLY BUT NO SUCH APPEARANCE CAN BE PRODUCED BY ANY CHARGE OF THE SAME JAR PROVIDED THE SAME STRING BE MOISTENED WITH ONE OF THE MINERAL ACIDS TO THE PRECEDING INSTANCE WE MAY ADD THE VARIOUS INSTANCES OF METALS WHICH WILL CONDUCT THE ELECTRI CAL FLUID WITHOUT ANY APPEARANCE OF LIGHT IN CIRCUMSTANCES THE SAME WITH THOSE IN WHICH THE SAME FORCE WOULD HAVE AP PEARED LUMINOUS IN PASSING THROUGH OTHER BODIES WHOSE CON DUCTING POWER IS LESS BUT I PROCEED TO OBSERVE III THAT THE EASE WITH WHICH THE ELECTRICAL FLUID IS RENDERED LUMINOUS IN ANY PARTICULAR BODY IS INCREASED BY INCREASING THE RARITY OF THE BODY THE APPEARANCE OF A SPARK OR OF THE DISCHARGE OF A LEYDEN PHIAL IN RAREFIED AIR IS WELL KNOWN BUT WE NEED NOT REST THE TRUTH OF THE PRECEDING OBSERVATION ON THE SEVERAL VARIETIES OF THIS FACT SIMILAR PHAENOMENA ATTEND THE RAREFACTION OF AETHER OF SPIRITS OF WINE AND OF WATER EXP IV INTO THE ORIFICE OF A TUBE 48 INCHES LONG AND TWO THIRDS OF AN INCH IN DIAMETER I CEMENTED AN IRON BALL SO AS TO BEAR THE WEIGHT WHICH PRESSED UPON IT WHEN I FILLED THE TUBE WITH QUICKSILVER LEAVING ONLY AN INTERVAL AT THE OPEN END WHICH CONTAINED A FEW DROPS OF WATER HAVING INVERTED THE TUBE AND PLUNGED THE OPEN END OF IT INTO A BASON OF MERCURY THE MERCURY IN THE TUBE STOOD NEARLY HALF AN INCH LOWER THAN IT  THE THICKNESS AND DIAMETER OF THE STRING SHOULD BE REGULATED BY THE FORCE WE EMPLOY DIDTHE LIGHT OF BODIES IN A STATE OF COMBUSTION 201 DID IN A BAROMETER AT THE SAME INSTANT OWING TO THE VAPOUR WHICH WAS FORMED BY THE WATER BUT THROUGH THIS RAREFIED WA TER THE ELECTRICAL SPARK PASSED AS LUMINOUSLY AS IT DOES THROUGH AIR EQUALLY RAREFIED EXP V IF INSTEAD OF WATER A FEW DROPS OF SPIRITS OF WINE ARE PLACED ON THE SURFACE OF THE MERCURY PHAENOMENA SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE PRECEDING EXPERIMENT WILL BE DISCOVERED WITH THIS DIFFERENCE ONLY THAT AS THE VAPOUR IN THIS CASE IS MORE DENSE THE ELECTRICAL SPARK IN ITS PASSAGE THROUGH IT IS NOT QUITE SO LUMINOUS AS IT IS IN THE VAPOUR OF WATER EXP VI GOOD AETHER SUBSTITUTED IN THE ROOM OF THE SPIRITS OF WINE WILL PRESS THE MERCURY DOWN SO LOW AS THE HEIGHT OF 16 OR 17 INCHES THE ELECTRICAL FLUID IN PASSING THROUGH THIS VAPOUR UNLESS THE FORCE BE VERY GREAT INDEED IS SCARCELY LUMI NOUS BUT IF THE PRESSURE ON THE SURFACE OF THE MERCURY IN THE BASON BE GRADUALLY LESSENED BY THE AID OF AN AIRPUMP THE VA POUR WILL BECOME MORE AND MORE RARE AND THE ELECTRIC SPARK IN PASSING THROUGH IT MORE AND MORE LUMINOUS EXP VII I COULD NOT DISCOVER THAT ANY VAPOUR ESCAPED FROM THE MINERAL ACIDS WHEN EXPOSED IN VACUO TO GIVE THEM THEREFORE GREATER VARITY OR TENUITY I FOUND DIFFERENT METHODS NECESSARY WITH A FINE CAMELHAIR PENCIL DIPPED IN THE VI TRIOLIC THE NITROUS OR THE MARINE ACID I DREW UPON A PIECE OF GLASS A LINE ABOUT ONEEIGHTH OF AN INCH BROAD IN SOME IN STANCES I EXTENDED THIS LINE TO THE LENGTH OF 27 INCHES AND FOUND THAT THE CONTENTS OF AN ELECTRIC BATTERY CONSISTING OF 10 PINT PHIALS COATED WOULD PASS OVER THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THIS LINE WITH THE GREATEST BRILLIANCY IF BY WIDENING THE LINE OR BY LAYING ON A DROP OF THE ACID ITS QUANTITY WAS INCREASED IN ANY PARTICULAR PART THE CHARGE IN PASSING THROUGH THAT PART NEVER APPEARED LUMINOUS WATER SPIRITS OF WINE CIRCUM VOL LXXV D D STANCED202 MR MORGANS OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS ON STANCED SIMILARLY TO THE ACIDS IN THE PRECEDING EXPERIMENT WERE ATTENDED WITH SIMILAR BUT NOT EQUAL EFFECTS BECAUSE IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE INFERIORITY OF THEIR CONDUCTING POWER IT WAS NECESSARY TO MAKE THE LINE THROUGH WHICH THE CHARGE PASSED CONSIDERABLY SHORTER 4 THE BRILLIANCY OR SPLENDOR OF THE ELECTRIC FLUID IN ITS PASSAGE THROUGH ANY BODY IS ALWAYS INCREASED BY LESSENING THE DIMENSIONS OF THAT BODY I WOULD EXPLAIN MY MEANING BY SAY ING THAT A SPARK OR THE DISCHARGE OF A BATTERY WHICH WE MIGHT SUPPOSE EQUAL TO A SPHERE ONE QUARTER OF AN INCH IN DIAMETER WOULD APPEAR MUCH MORE BRILLIANT IF THE SAME QUANTITY OF FLUID IS COMPRESSED INTO A SPHERE ONEEIGHTH OF AN INCH IN DIAMETER THIS OBSERVATION IS THE OBVIOUS CONSEQUENCE OF MANY KNOWN FACTS IF THE MACHINE BE LARGE ENOUGH TO AFFORD A SPARK WHOSE LENGTH IS NINE OR TEN INCHES THIS SPARK MAY BE SEEN SOMETIMES FORMING ITSELF INTO A BRUSH IN WHICH STATE IT OCCUPIES MORE ROOM BUT AP PEARS VERY SAINTLY LUMINOUS AT OTHER TIMES THE SAME SPARK MAY BE SEEN DIVIDING ITSELF INTO A VARIETY OF RAMIFICATIONS WHICH SHOOT INTO THE SURROUNDING AIR IN THIS CASE LIKEWISE THE FLUID IS DIFFUSED OVER A LARGE SURFACE AND IN PROPORTION TO THE EXTENT OF THAT SURFACE SO IS THE FAINTNESS OF THE APPEARANCE A SPARK WHICH IN THE OPEN AIR CANNOT EXCEED ONE QUARTER OF AN INCH IN DIAMETER WILL APPEAR TO FILL THE WHOLE OF AN EXHAUSTED RECEIVER FOUR INCHES WIDE AND EIGHT INCHES LONG BUT IN THE FORMER CASE IT IS BRILLIANT AND IN THE LATTER IT GROWS FAINTER AND FAINTER AS THE SIZE OF THE RECEIVER INCREASES TO PROVE THE OBSERVATION WHICH I THINK MAY BE JUSTIFIED BY THE PRECEDING FACTS I MADE THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENTS EXP VIII TO AN INSULATED BALL FOUR INCHES IN DIAMETER I FIXED A SILVER THREAD ABOUT FOUR YARDS LONG THIS THREAD AT THE END WHICH WAS REMOTEST FROM THE BALL WAS FIXED TO ANOTHER 5 INSULATEDTHE LIGHT OF BODIES IN A STATE OF COMBUSTION 203 INSULATED SUBSTANCE I BROUGHT THE BALL WITHIN THE STRIKING DISTANCE OF MY CONDUCTOR AND THE SPARK IN PASSING FROM THE CON DUCTOR TO THE BALL APPEARED VERY BRILLIANT BUT THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE SILVER THREAD APPEARED FAINTLY LUMINOUS AT THE SAME IN STANT IN OTHER WORDS WHEN THE SPARK WAS CONFINED WITHIN THE DIMENSIONS OF A SPHERE ONEEIGHTH OF AN INCH IN DIAMETER IT WAS BRIGHT BUT WHEN DIFFUSED OVER THE SURFACE OF AIR WHICH RECEIVED IT FROM THE THREAD ITS LIGHT BECAME SO FAINT AS TO BE SEEN ONLY IN A DARK ROOM IF I LESSENED THE SURFACE OF AIR WHICH RECEIVED THE SPARK BY SHORTENING THE THREAD I NEVER FAILED TO INCREASE THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE APPEARANCE EXP IX TO PROVE THAT THE FAINTNESS OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT IN VACUO DEPENDS ON THE ENLARGED DIMENSIONS OF THE SPACE THROUGH WHICH IT IS DIFFUSED WE HAVE NOTHING MORE TO DO THAN TO IN TRODUCE TWO POINTED WIRES INTO THE VACUUM SO THAT THE FLUID MAY PASS FROM THE POINT OF THE ONE TO THE POINT OF THE OTHER WHEN THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM IS NOT MORE THAN THE ONETENTH OF AN INCH IN THIS CASE WE SHALL FIND A BRILLIANCY AS GREAT AS IN THE OPEN AIR EXP X INTO A TORRICELLIAN VACUUM 36 INCHES IN LENGTH I CONVEYED AS MUCH AIR AS WOULD HAVE FILLED TWO INCHES ONLY OF THE EXHAUSTED TUBE IF IT WERE INVERTED IN WATER THIS QUANTITY OF AIR AFFORDED RESISTANCE ENOUGH TO CONDENSE THE FLUID AS IT PASSED THROUGH THE TUBE INTO A SPARK 38 INCHES IN LENGTH THE BRIL LIANCY OF THE SPARK IN CONDENSED AIR IN WATER AND IN ALL SUB STANCES THROUGH WHICH IT PASSES WITH DIFFICULTY DEPENDS ON PRINCIPLES SIMILAR TO THOSE WHICH ACCOUNT FOR THE PRECEDING FACTS I WOULD NOW PROCEED TO SHEW 5 THAT IN THE APPEARANCES OF ELECTRICITY AS WELL AS IN THOSE OF BURNING BODIES THERE ARE CASES IN WHICH ALL THE RAYS OF LIGHT DO NOT ESCAPE AND THAT THE MOST REFRANGIBLE RAYS ARE THOSE D D 2 WHICH204 MR MORGANS OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS ON WHICH ESCAPE FIRST OR MOST EASILY THE ELECTRICAL BRUSH IS ALWAYS OF A PURPLE OR BLUISH HUE IF YOU CONVEY A SPARK THROUGH A TORRICELLIAN VACUUM MADE  WITHOUT BOILING THE MERCURY IN THE TUBE THE BRUSH WILL DISPLAY THE INDIGO RAYS THE SPARK HOWEVER MAY BE DIVIDED AND WEAKENED EVEN IN THE OPEN AIR SO AS TO YIELD THE MOST REFRANGIBLE RAYS ONLY EXP XI TO AN INSULATED METALLIC BALL FOUR INCHES IN DIA METER I FIXED A WIRE A FOOT AND A HALF LONG THIS WIRE TERMI NATED IN FOUR RAMIFICATIONS EACH OF WHICH WAS FIXED TO A METALLIC BALL HALF AN INCH IN DIAMETER AND PLACED AT AN EQUAL DISTANCE FROM A METALLIC PLATE WHICH COMMUNICATED BY METALLIC CONDUCTORS WITH THE GROUND A POWERFUL SPARK AFTER FALLING ON THE LARGE BALL AT ONE EXTREMITY OF THE WIRE WAS DIVIDED IN ITS PASSAGE FROM THE FOUR SMALL BALLS TO THE METALLIC PLATE WHEN I EXAMINED THIS DIVISION OF THE FLUID IN A DARK ROOM I DISCOVERED SOME LITTLE RAMIFICATIONS WHICH YIELDED THE INDIGO RAYS ONLY INDEED AT THE EDGES OF ALL WEAK SPARKS THE SAME PURPLE APPEARANCE MAY BE DISCOVERED WE MAY LIKEWISE OBSERVE THAT THE NEARER WE APPROACH THE CENTER OF THE SPARK THE GREATER IS THE BRILLIANCY OF ITS COLOUR BUT I WOULD NOW WISH TO SHEW 6 THAT THE INFLUENCE OF DIFFERENT MEDIA ON ELECTRICAL LIGHT IS ANALOGOUS TO THEIR INFLUENCE ON SOLAR LIGHT AND WILL HELP US TO ACCOUNT FOR SOME VERY SINGULAR APPEARANCES EXPXII LET A POINTED WIRE HAVING A METALLIC BALL FIXED TO ONE OF ITS EXTREMITIES BE FORCED OBLIQUELY INTO A PIECE OF WOOD SO AS TO MAKE A SMALL ANGLE WITH THE SURFACE OF THE WOOD AND TO MAKE  IF THE TORRICELLIAN VACUUM IS MADE WITH MERCURY PERFECTLY PURGED OF AIR IT BECOMES A PERFECT NONCONDUCTOR THIS I BELIEVE WILL BE PROVED DECISIVELY BY SOME EXPERIMENTS WHICH I HOPE WILL BE SOON COMMUNICATED TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY DR PRICE 1 THETHE LIGHT OF BODIES IN A STATE OF COMBUSTION 205 THE POINT LIE ABOUT ONEEIGHTH OF AN INCH BELOW THE SURFACE LET ANOTHER POINTED WIRE WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH THE GROUND BE FORCED IN THE SAME MANNER INTO THE SAME WOOD SO THAT ITS POINT LIKEWISE MAY LIE ABOUT ONEEIGHTH OF AN INCH BELOW THE SURFACE AND ABOUT TWO INCHES DISTANT FROM THE POINT OF THE FIRST WIRE LET THE WOOD BE INSULATED AND A STRONG SPARK WHICH STRIKES ON THE METALLIC BALL WILL FORCE ITS PASSAGE THROUGH THE INTERVAL OF WOOD WHICH LIES BETWEEN THE POINTS AND APPEAR AS RED AS BLOOD TO PROVE THAT THIS APPEARANCE DEPENDS ON THE WOODS ABSORPTION OF ALL THE RAYS BUT THE RED I WOULD OBSERVE THAT THE GREATER THE DEPTH OF THE POINTS IS BELOW THE SURFACE THE LESS MIXED ARE THE RED RAYS I HAVE BEEN ABLE SOMETIMES BY IN CREASING OR DIMINISHING THE DEPTH OF THE POINTS TO GIVE THE SPARK THE FOLLOWING SUCCESSION OF COLOURS WHEN THEY WERE DEEPEST BELOW THE SURFACE THE RED ONLY CAME TO THE EYE THROUGH A PRISM WHEN THEY WERE RAISED A LITTLE NEARER THE SURFACE THE RED AND ORANGE APPEARED WHEN NEARER STILL THE YELLOW AND SO ON TILL BY MAKING THE SPARK PASS THROUGH THE WOOD VERY NEAR ITS SURFACE ALL THE RAYS WERE AT LENGTH ABLE TO REACH THE EYE IF THE POINTS BE ONLY ONEEIGHTH OF AN INCH BELOW THE SURFACE OF SOFT DEAL WOOD THE RED THE ORANGE AND THE YEL LOW RAYS WILL APPEAR AS THE SPARK PASSES THROUGH IT BUT WHEN THE POINTS ARE AT AN EQUAL DEPTH IN A HARDER PIECE OF WOOD SUCH AS BOX THE YELLOW AND PERHAPS THE ORANGE WILL DISAPPEAR AS A FARTHER PROOF THAT THE PHAENOMENA I AM DESCRIBING ARE OWING TO THE INTERPOSITION OF THE WOOD AS A MEDIUM WHICH ABSORBS SOME OF THE RAYS AND SUFFERS OTHERS TO ESCAPE IT MAY BE OBSERVED THAT WHEN THE SPARK STRIKES VERY BRILLIANTLY ON ONE SIDE OF THE PIECE OF DEAL ON THE OTHER SIDE IT WILL APPEAR VERY RED IN LIKE MAN NER A RED APPEARANCE MAY BE GIVEN TO A SPARK WHICH STRIKES BRILLIANTLY206 MR MORGANS OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS ON BRILLIANTLY OVER THE INSIDE OF A TUBE MERELY BY SPREADING SOME PITCH VERY THINLY OVER THE OUTSIDE OF THE SAME TUBE EXP XIII I WOULD NOW GIVE ANOTHER FACT WHOSE SINGULARI TIES DEPEND VERY MUCH ON THE INFLUENCE OF THE MEDIUM THROUGH WHICH THE ELECTRICAL LIGHT IS MADE TO PASS IF INTO A TORRICEL LIAN VACUUM OF ANY LENGTH A FEW DROPS OF AETHER ARE CONVEYED AND BOTH ENDS OF THE VACUUM ARE STOPPED UP WITH METALLIC CON DUCTORS SO THAT A SPARK MAY PASS THROUGH IT THE SPARK IN ITS PASSAGE WILL ASSUME THE FOLLOWING APPEARANCES WHEN THE EYE IS PLACED CLOSE TO THE TUBE THE SPARK WILL APPEAR PERFECTLY WHITE IF THE EYE IS REMOVED TO THE DISTANCE OF TWO YARDS IT WILL APPEAR GREEN BUT AT THE DISTANCE OF SIX OR SEVEN YARDS THE COLOUR OF THE SPARK WILL BE REDDISH THESE CHANGES EVI DENTLY DEPEND ON THE QUANTITY OF MEDIUM THROUGH WHICH THE THE LIGHT PASSES AND THE RED LIGHT MORE PARTICULARLY WHICH WE SEE AT THE GREATEST DISTANCE FROM THE TUBE IS ACCOUNTED FOR ON THE SAME PRINCIPLE AS THE RED LIGHT OF A DISTANT CANDLE OR A BECLOUDED SUN EXP XIV DR PRIESTLEY LONG AGO OBSERVED THE RED AP PEARANCE OF THE SPARK WHEN PASSING THROUGH INFLAMMABLE AIR BUT THIS APPEARANCE IS VERY MUCH DIVERSIFIED BY THE QUANTITY OF MEDIUM THROUGH WHICH YOU LOOK AT THE SPARK WHEN AT A VERY CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE THE RED COMES TO THE EYE UNMIXED BUT IF THE EYE IS PLACED CLOSE TO THE TUBE THE SPARK APPEARS WHITE AND BRILLIANT IN CONFIRMATION HOWEVER OF SOME OF MY CONCLUSIONS I WOULD OBSERVE THAT BY INCREASING THE QUANTITY OF FLUID WHICH IS CONVEYED THROUGH ANY PORTION OF INFLAMMABLE AIR OR BY CONDENSING THAT AIR THE SPARK MAY BE ENTIRELY DEPRIVED OF ITS RED APPEARANCE AND MADE PERFECTLY BRILLIANT I HAVE ONLY TO ADD THAT ALL WEAK EXPLOSIONS AND SPARKSTHE LIGHT OF BODIES IN A STATE OF COMBUSTION 207 SPARKS WHEN VIEWED AT A DISTANCE BEAR A REDDISH HUE SUCH ARE THE EXPLOSIONS WHICH HAVE PASSED THROUGH WATER SPIRITS OF WINE OR ANY BAD CONDUCTOR WHEN CONFINED IN A TUBE WHOSE DIAMETER IS NOT MORE THAN AN INCH THE REASON OF THESE APPEARANCES SEEMS TO BE THAT THE WEAKER THE SPARK OR EXPLOSION IS THE LESS IS THE LIGHT WHICH ESCAPES AND THE MORE VISIBLE THE EFFECT OF ANY MEDIUM WHICH HAS A POWER TO ABSORB SOME OF THAT LIGHT THE PRECEDING OBSERVATIONS CONCERNING ELECTRICAL LIGHT WERE THE RESULT OF MY ATTEMPTS TO ARRANGE UNDER GENERAL HEADS THE PRINCIPAL SINGULARITIES ATTENDING IT THEY MAY PERHAPS ASSIST OTHERS IN DETERMINING HOW FAR THEY MAY HAVE LED MY MIND ASTRAY IN GIVING BIRTH TO A THEORY WHICH I WOULD NOW BRIEFLY DESCRIBE IN A FEW QUERIES I IF WE CONSIDER ALL BODIES AS COMPOUNDS WHOSE CONSTITUENT PARTS ARE KEPT TOGETHER BY ATTRACING ONE ANOTHER WITH DIFFERENT FORCES CAN WE AVOID CONCLUDING THAT THE OPERATIONS OF THAT ATTRACTIVE FORCE ARE REGULATED NOT ONLY BY THE QUALITY BUT THE QUANTITY LIKEWISE OF THOSE COMPONENT PARTS IF AN UNION OF A CERTAIN NUMBER OF ONE KIND OF PARTICLES WITH A CERTAIN NUM BER OF A SECOND AND THIRD KIND OF PARTICLES FORMS A PARTICULAR BODY MUST NOT THE BOND WHICH KEEPS THAT BODY TOGETHER BE WEAKENED OR STRENGTHENED BY INCREASING OR DIMINISHING ANY ONE OF THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF PARTICLES WHICH ENTER INTO ITS CONSTI TUTION II WHEN TO THE NATURAL SHARE OF THE ELECTRIC FLUID AL READY EXISTING IN THE BODY A FRESH QUANTITY OF THE SAME FLUID IS ADDED MUST NOT SOME OF THE COMPONENT PARTS OF THAT BODY ESCAPE OR MUST NOT THAT ATTRACTIVE FORCE WHICH KEPT ALL TOGETHER BE SO FAR WEAKENED AS TO LET LOOSE SOME CONSTITUENT PARTS208 MR MORGANS OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS ON PARTS AND AMONGST THESE THE PARTICLES OF LIGHT IN PARTI CULAR III MUST NOT THIS SEPARATION OF PARTS BE GREAT IN PROPORTION TO THE QUANTITY OF EXTRANEOUS PARTICLES WHICH ARE ADDED TO THE BODY OR AGREEABLE TO THE 4TH OBSERVATION MUST NOT THE SPARK BE MORE SPLENDID AND BRILLIANT THE MORE THE ELECTRICAL FLUID IS CONCENTERED IN ANY GIVEN SPACE IV IN THE DIMINUTION OR ALTERATION OF THAT ATTRACTIVE FORCE ON WHICH DEPENDS THE CONSTITUTION OF BODIES MAY THERE NOT BE A GRADATION WHICH IN THE PRESENT CASE AS WELL AS IN THAT OF BURNING BODIES WILL CAUSE THE ESCAPE OF SOME RAYS SOONER THAN OTHERS OBSERVATIONS ON PHOSPHORIC LIGHT IT IS OBVIOUS FROM MR B WILSONS EXPERIMENTS THAT THERE ARE MANY CURIOUS DIVERSITIES IN THE APPEARANCES OF PHOS PHORI SOME SHELLS PREPARED AGREEABLY TO HIS DIRECTIONS AFTER EXPOSURE TO THE SUN OR TO THE FLASH OF A BATTERY EMIT A PURPLE OTHERS A GREEN AND OTHERS A REDDISH LIGHT IF WITH MR WIL SON WE SUPPOSE THAT THESE SHELLS ARE IN A STATE OF FLOW COM BUSTION MAY WE NOT CONCLUDE THAT SOME ARE JUST BEGINNING TO BURN AND THEREFORE AGREEABLY TO WHAT I HAVE OBSERVED ON COM BUSTIBLE BODIES EMITTING THE MOST REFRANGIBLE RAYS WHILST OTHERS ARE IN A MORE ADVANCED STATE OF COMBUSTION AND THEREFORE EMITTING THE LEAST REFRANGIBLE IF THIS CONCLUSION BE RIGHT THE SHELLS WHICH ARE EMITTING THE PURPLE OR THE GREEN MUST STILL RETAIN THE YELLOW THE ORANGE AND THE RED WHICH WILL ALSO MAKE THEIR APPEARANCE AS SOON AS THE COMBUSTION IS SUFFI CIENTLY INCREASED EXPTHE LIGHT OF BODIES IN A STATE OF COMBUSTION 209 EXP XV PLACE A SHELL WHILST EMITTING ITS GREEN RAYS ON A WARM SHOVEL AND THE APPEARANCE OF THE SHELL WILL BE SOON CHANGED INTO THAT OF A YELLOW MIXED WITH RED TO MR WIL SONS THEORY HOWEVER OF SLOW COMBUSTION THE FOLLOWING OB JECTIONS MAY BE OPPOSED 1 IF PHOSPHORIC SHELLS OWE THEIR LIGHT TO THIS CAUSE WE MUST CONSIDER THE WORD COMBUSTION WHEN APPLIED TO THEM AS IMPLYING IN ITS SIGNIFICATION ALL THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH ARE THE USUAL ATTENDANTS OF A BODY WHILST ON FIRE AMONGST OTHER NECESSARY CONSEQUENCES IN SUCH A CASE THE INCREASE OF HEAT MUST INCREASE THE DECOMPOSITION OF THE COMBUSTIBLE WHEREAS WE DISCOVER AN EFFECT THE VERY OPPOSITE TO THIS IN THE APPEARANCE OF A PHOSPHORIC BODY WHICH NEVER FAILS TO LOSE ITS LIGHT ENTIRELY IN A CERTAIN DEGREE OF HEAT WITHOUT LOSING THE POWER OF BE COMING PHOSPHORIC AGAIN WHEN IT HAS BEEN SUFFICIENTLY COOLED BESIDES WHEN A PHOSPHORIC SHELL HAS BEEN MADE VERY HOT AND WHILE IT HAS CONTINUED SO I HAVE CONVEYED THE MOST BRILLIANT DISCHARGE OF A BATTERY OVER IT WITHOUT EFFECT IN OTHER WORDS HEAT OR THE VERY CAUSE WHICH PROMOTES COMBUSTION IN ALL OTHER INSTANCES IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE PUTS AN END TO IT MR WIL SON IN HIS TREATISE ON PHOSPHORI HAS DESCRIBED AN EXPERIMENT SIMILAR TO THE PRECEDING BUT THE RESULT HE MENTIONS IS DIFFERENT FROM THAT HERE MENTIONED HOWEVER FROM A REGARD TO HIS AUTHORITY I HAVE SO FREQUENTLY REPEATED MY TRIALS THAT I CANNOT JUSTLY SUSPECT MYSELF OF ANY INACCURACY 2 WHEN BODIES ARE WASTED BY COMBUSTION THEY CAN NEVER BE MADE TO REASSUME THE APPEARANCES WHICH THEY PREVIOUSLY DISPLAYED NO POWER CAN GIVE TO ASHES THE PHAENOMENA OF A BURNING COAL BUT PHOSPHORIC BODIES ARE VERY DIFFERENT IN THIS RESPECT FOR A SHELL MAY BE MADE TO LOSE ALL ITS LIGHT BY EXPOSURE TO HEAT AND AGAIN VOL LXXV E E MAY210 MR MORGANS OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS ON MAY BE MADE AS LUMINOUS AS EVER BY EXPOSURE TO THE SUN BUT 3 IT IS OBSERVABLE THAT SOME BODIES WHICH ARE MOST BEAU TIFULLY PHOSPHORIC OR WHICH ACCORDING TO MR WILSONS THEORY ARE IN THE BEST STATE OF SLOW COMBUSTION IT IS OBSERVABLE I SAY THAT THE SAME BODIES ARE THE MOST OBSTINATE IN RESISTING THE FIRE THE DIAMOND WHICH TO BE DECOMPOSED REQUIRES THE FORCE OF A MOST POWERFUL FURNACE IS ACCORDING TO THIS THEORY WASTING AWAY OWING TO A SEPARATION OF PARTS WHICH IS PROMOTED BY THE WEAKEST INFLUENCE OF THE SUNS RAYSWITH OUT DETERMINING WHETHER THE PRECEDING OBJECTIONS BE VALID LET US NOW SEE THE CONSEQUENCE OF ADMITTING THE COMMON HYPOTHESIS THAT THE DETENTION OF THOSE RAYS WHICH FALL UPON PHOSPHORI IS OWING TO SOME FORCE WHICH PREVENTS THEIR IMMEDIATE REFLECTION BUT IS NOT ADEQUATE TO THEIR ENTIRE ABSORPTION THIS FORCE WHATEVER IT BE CANNOT WELL BE SUPPOSED TO OPERATE WITH EQUAL POWER ON ALL THE RAYS AND IF THIS BE NOT THE CASE I THINK WE CANNOT AVOID CONCLUDING THAT PHOSPHORIC SHELLS WILL ASSUME DIFFERENT COLOURS OWING TO THE EARLIER AND LATER ESCAPE OF THE DIFFERENT RAYS OF LIGHT THIS CONCLUSION IS JUSTIFIED BY AN EXPE RIMENT WHICH I HAVE ALREADY APPEALED TO WHEN THE FORCE IS SUCH AS TO ADMIT OF THE ESCAPE OF THE PURPLE THE BLUE AND THE GREEN WE HAVE ONLY TO LESSEN THAT FORCE BY WARMING THE BODY AND THE YELLOW THE ORANGE AND RED ESCAPE IT IS PROVED BY BECCARIAS EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE ON THIS SUBJECT THAT THERE IS SCARCELY ANY BODY WHICH IS NOT PHOSPHORIC OR WHICH MAY NOT BE MADE SO BY HEAT BUT AS THE PHOSPHORIC FORCE IS MOST POWERFUL WHEN THE PURPLE RAYS ONLY ESCAPE SO WE ARE TO CON CLUDE THAT IT IS WEAKEST WHEN IT IS ABLE TO RETAIN THE RED RAYS ONLY THIS CONCLUSION IS AGREEABLE TO SEVERAL FACTS CHALK OYSTER SHELLS TOGETHER WITH THOSE PHOSPHORIC BODIES WHOSE GOODNESS 7 HASTHE LIGHT OF BODIES IN A STATE OF COMBUSTION 211 HAS BEEN VERY MUCH IMPAIRED BY LONG KEEPING WHEN FINELY POWDERED AND PLACED WITHIN THE CIRCUIT OF AN ELECTRICAL BATTERY WILL EXHIBIT BY THEIR SCATTERED PARTICLES A SHOWER OF LIGHT BUT THESE PARTICLES WILL APPEAR REDDISH OR THEIR PHOSPHORIC POWER WILL BE SUFFICIENT ONLY TO DETAIN THE YELLOW ORANGE AND RED RAYS WHEN SPIRITS OF WINE ARE IN A SIMILAR MANNER BROUGHT WITHIN THE CIRCUIT OF A BATTERY A SIMILAR EFFECT MAY BE DISCOVERED ITS PARTICLES DIVERGE IN SEVERAL DIRECTIONS DISPLAYING A MOST BEAUTIFUL GOLDEN APPEARANCE THE METALLIC CALCES ARE OF ALL BODIES THOSE WHICH ARE RENDERED PHOSPHORIC WITH THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY BUT EVEN THESE MAY BE SCATTERED INTO A SHOWER OF RED LUMINOUS PARTICLES BY THE ELECTRIC STROKE NORWICH OCT 7 1784 POSTSCRIPT BY THE REV DR PRICE BY THE PHOSPHORIC FORCE MENTIONED IN THE LAST PARAGRAPH OF THIS PAPER MR MORGAN APPEARS TO MEAN NOT THE FORCE WITH WHICH A PHOSPHORIC BODY EMITS BUT THE FORCE WITH WHICH IT ABSORBS AND RETAINS LIGHT THIS LAST FORCE IS PROPORTIONED TO THE DEGREE OF ATTRACTION BETWEEN THE PHOSPHORIC BODY AND LIGHT AND THEREFORE MUST AS MR MORGAN OBSERVES BE WEAKEST WHEN IT EMITS SO FREELY THE LIGHT IT HAS IMBIBED AS NOT TO RETAIN THOSE RAYS WHICH ADHERE TO IT MOST STRONGLY AC CORDING TO MR MORGANS THEORY THESE RAYS ARE THOSE WHICH E E 2 ARE212 MR MORGANS OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS C ARE LEAST REFRANGIBLE THE OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS IN THIS PAPER SEEM TO RENDER THIS THEORY PROBABLE IT IS HOW EVER AN OBJECTION TO IT THAT THE LESS REFRANGIBILITY OF RAYS SEEMS TO IMPLY A LESS FORCE OF ATTRACTION BETWEEN THEM AND THE SUBSTANCES WHICH REFRACT THEM BUT IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED THAT POSSIBLY THE FORCE OF COHESION WHICH UNITES THE RAYS OF LIGHT TO BODIES MAY BE A DIFFERENT POWER FROM THAT WHICH REFRACTS THEM

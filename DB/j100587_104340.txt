J100587,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 16831775,104340,A LETTER FROM JOHN HUXHAM M D F R S TO C MORTIMER M D SECR R S CONCERNING AN EXTRAORDINARY HERNIA INGUINALIS AND AN OBSERVATION OF THE PASSAGE OF MERCURY OVER THE SUN OCT 31 1738,I206906,XXII A LETTER FROM JOHN HUXHAM M D F R S TO C MORTIMER M D SECR R S CONCERNING AN EXTRAORDINARY HERNIA INGUI NALIS AND AN OBSERVATION OF THE PASSAGE OF MERCURY OVER THE SUN OCT 31 1738 HONOURED S I R A S THE FREQUENT DISSECTION OF MORBID BODIES TENDS GREATLY TO ASCERTAIN THE DIAGNOSTIC AND PROGNOSTIC OF DISEASES DURING MY STUDIES AND FOR THE FIRST SIX OR EIGHT YEARS OF MY PRACTICE I APPLIED MYSELF TO IT WITH GREAT ASSIDUITY  SOME FEW OF THE MORE REMARKABLE CASES I HAVE MET WITH I BEG LEAVE TO SEND YOU FROM TIME TO TIME AND IF ANY OF THEM APPEAR TO YOU WORTHY OF THAT HONOUR YOU MAY LAY THEM BEFORE THE ROYAL SOCIETY  THE FOLLOWING MAY641 MAY BE OF SOME USE IN PRACTICE THEREFORE I SEND IT FIRST MR BURMAN A TAYLOR OF THIS TOWN ABOUT 40 HAD FROM HIS CHILDHOOD LABOURED UNDER A SMALL IN GUINAL RUPTURE ON THE RIGHT SIDE BUT ABOUT SIX YEARS BEFORE HIS DEATH FROM A BLOW RECEIVED IN HIS GROIN THE HERNIA BECAME VERY LARGE AND THE GUT ALWAYS REMAINED DOWN IN THE SCROTUM FOR HE WORE NO BAG TRUSS OR THE LIKE TO SUPPORT IT  THE DAY BEFORE HIS DEATH HE WAS FOLLOWING HIS WORK AS USUAL WITH HIS PRESSINGIRON WITHOUT ANY VIOLENT JERK OR STRAINING BUT ABOUT 10 IN THE MORNING ALL AT ONCE HE FELT A VERY GREAT PAIN IN HIS RIGHT INGUEN WHICH CONTINUALLY INCREASING IN TWO OR THREE HOURS THREW HIM INTO VOMITINGS COLD SWEATS C  HIS APOTHECARY MR ELLERY GAVE HIM A CLYSTER WHICH BROUGHT OFF A SMALL MATTER OF THIN STOOL BUT GAVE NO RELIEF THOUGH IT HAD BEEN FORMERLY VERY SERVICEABLE TO HIM IN THE LIKE DISORDER  ABOUT EIGHT IN THE EVENING I WAS SENT FOR AND FOUND HIM IN COLD SWEATS WITH SCARCE ANY PULSE THE HERNIAL TUMOUR WAS PRODIGIOUS LARGE AND EXCEEDING HARD THE PAINS EXTREMELY VIOLENT WHICH CAUSED EXCESSIVE LAN GUORS  I IMMEDIATELY ORDERED THAT HE SHOULD BE PLACED IN A PROPER POSTURE THAT A WARM AROMATIC EMOLLIENT FOMENTATION SHOULD BE FREQUENTLY AND LONG APPLIED AND THAT A REDUCTION OF THE INTESTINE SHOULD BE ATTEMPTED OR IF THAT DID NOT SUCCEED THAT THE OPERATION FOR THE BUBONOCELE SHOULD BE PERFORMED  THE FOMENTATION WAS TRIED A LONG WHILE EMOL LIENT TEREBINTHINATE CLYSTERS INJECTED AND THE RE DUCTION ATTEMPTED FOR AN HOUR OR TWO BY MR JOHN START A SKILFUL SURGEON BUT IN VAIN NAY THE SWEL LING642 LING INCREASED CONSIDERABLY DURING THE APPLICATION AND THE PAIN BECAME IF POSSIBLE MORE AGGRAVATED ALL OVER THE HERNIA WHICH BEFORE WAS CHIEFLY AT AND NEAR THE RINGS OF THE ABDOMINAL MUSCLES AND THIS TOO THOUGH HE TOOK WITH AN EASY CORDIAL AND MULLED WINE LAUDAN SOLID GR IJ 3IIS HORIS  EARLY THE NEXT MORNING I WAS DESIRED TO SEE HIM AGAIN AND FINDING THAT HE HAD NOT SLEPT A MOMENT THE TUMOUR CONSIDERABLY INCREASED AND EXCESSIVE HARD THOUGH NOT DISCOLOURED AND THE PATIENT EXCEEDING WEAK AND PAINED I ADVISED THE OPERATION FORTHWITH AS THE ONLY POSSIBLE MEANS OF SAVING HIM BUT HE WAS UN WILLING TO ADMIT OF IT AND WE WERE ALL INDEED DIF FIDENT OF THE SUCCESS  WHILST A FRESH FOMENTATION WAS GETTING READY THE POOR MAN EXPIRED IN AGONIES  ABOUT AN HOUR OR TWO AFTER WE OPENED THE SCROTUM WHICH IN SO SHORT A SPACE OF TIME APPEARED ALL LIVID AND THE BLOODVESSELS WERE EXTREMELY TURGID AND VARICOSE  UPON CUTTING THROUGH THE TEGU MENTS PART OF THE COLON AND ILIUM THRUST OUT WITH GREAT FORCE THEY WERE BOTH PRODIGIOUSLY DISTENDED WITH WIND HIGHLY INFLAMED AND IN SEVERAL PLACES VERY LIVID  THAT PART OF THE GUTS COMMONLY CALLED CAECUM WAS BLOWN UP INTO A KIND OF GLOBULAR FIGURE AS BIG AS A CHILDS HEAD  IT WAS REMARKABLE WHE THER IN THE ORIGINAL CONFORMATION OR BY THE VAST DISTENTION I KNOW NOT THAT THERE WAS NO MANNER OF APPEARANCE OF THE APPENDIX VERMIFORMIS TO BE FOUND THOUGH WE DILIGENTLY EXAMINED  AND FUR THER THAT THE CAECUM WAS VASTLY THICKER SET WITH GLANDS AND THEY MUCH LARGER THAN I HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE IN ANY SUBJECT  THE CONVOLUTIONS OF THE ILIUM AND COLON WERE SO IMMENSLY DISTENDED WITH WIND643 WIND THAT THE VALVULAR CORRUGATIONS IN BOTH ALMOST TOTALLY DISAPPEARED  YET EXACTLY AT THE VALVULA TULPII ALIAS BAUHINI THERE WAS A VERY GREAT CON STRICTION OF THE INTESTINAL CANAL AS IF TIED STRONGLY WITH A CORD AND THOUGH WE OPENED THE COLON ABOUT A HANDSBREADTH BEYOND THE VALVE AND LET OUT THE FLATUS WE COULD NOT POSSIBLY PRESS ANY WIND FROM THE ILIUM INTO THE COLON THROUGH THE VALVE  I SUSPECTED INDURATED EXCREMENT AS AN OBSTACLE BUT ON A CAREFUL INQUIRY ONLY FOUND THE WHOLE VALVULAR PRODUCTION AND THE END OF THE ILIUM AT ITS INSERTION INTO THE COLON HIGHLY INFLAMED AND QUITE SHUTTING UP THE PASSAGE  ON DILATING THE RINGS OF THE OBLIQUE AND TRANSVERSE MUSCLES THE WIND RUMBLED UP OUT OF THE ILIUM INTO THE CAVITY OF THE BELLY VERY READILY  WE FOUND PRETTY MUCH BLOODY SANIES IN THE GUTS ON SLITTING THEM OPEN BUT LITTLE OR NO INDU RATED FAECES A MANIFEST PROOF THAT THE EXCEEDING HARDNESS OF THE TUMOUR WAS OWING ONLY TO THE EX CESSIVE FLATULENCE AND GREAT INFLAMMATION AND SHEWS HOW MUCH WE MAY BE DECEIVED IN OUR CONJECTURE ON LIKE OCCASIONS  THE TUMOUR OF THE SCROTUM WAS 28 INCHES ROUND  I WAS MUCH SURPRISED TO FIND NO ADHESION OF THE INTESTINES TO THE CONTAINING PARTS THOUGH HE HAD SO LONG LABOURED UNDER THE HERNIA THIS UNHAPPY CASE GAVE ME A SEVERE REFLECTION AND I CANNOT BUT THINK THE MALADY WAS MUCH INCREASED BY THE REPEATED APPLICATION OF THE HOT FOMENTA TIONS AS IT RAREFIED THE AIR GREATLY AND BY RELAXING THE PARTS GAVE FURTHER ROOM TO THE VAST EXPANSION  AT THAT TIME I HAD NEVER SEEN BELLOSTES SECOND PART TO HIS HOSPITALSURGEON WHERE HE ADVISES IN O O O O SUCH644 SUCH CASES THE MOST COLD ASTRINGENT FOMENTATIONS  IN THIS AND THE LIKE THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN VERY PROPER ESPECIALLY IF A PORTION OF SPIRIT OF WINE CAMPHORATED HAD BEEN ADDED TO PREVENT MORTIFI CATION IT SOMETIMES HAPPENS THAT THOUGH THE ANNULAR PERFORATIONS OF THE ABDOMINAL MUSCLES ARE DILATED BY THE OPERATION YET THE HERNIA CANNOT BE REDUCED  I BELIEVE AS THE GUTS WERE DISTENDED TO SO ENORMOUS A BULK IN THIS MAN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPRACTI CABLE IN SUCH CASES MAY IT NOT BE PROPER TO PRICK THEM WITH A NEEDLE TO LET OUT THE FLATUS AS IS COM MONLY PRACTISED IN SMALL WOUNDS OF THE ABDOMEN WHERE THE INTESTINE THRUSTS OUT AND BECOMES SO TURGID WITH WIND THAT IT CANNOT OTHERWISE BE RETURNED  IN SOME VENTRAL RUPTURES AS THEY ARE CALLED THIS ALSO MAY BE NECESSARY  I FIND MR SHARP IN HIS LATE EXCELLENT PIECE OF SURGERY APPROVES OF THIS METHOD FROM AN OLD ENGLISH PRACTITIONER WHO HAD OFTEN USED IT WITH SUCCESS  I AM PERSUADED PUNCTURES IN THIS MANNER ARE MUCH LESS DANGEROUS THAN THE OPERATION AND BELIEVE IN SUCH CASES MAY BE MORE EFFECTUAL  IT IS A COMMON THING WITH GRASIERS AND CATTLEDOC TORS TO PRICK THE GUTS OF THEIR SHEEP AND BULLOCKS WITH GREAT SUCCES WHEN BY FEEDING ON CLOVER OR FRESH YOUNG GRASS THEIR GUTS BECOME SO VASTLY DIS TENDED WITH WIND AS WOULD OTHERWISE CERTAINLY KILL THEM  MAY NOT A VERY SMALL HOLLOW NEEDLE WITH PERFORATIONS AS IN THAT USED BY SOME INSTEAD OF THE TROCAR FOR A PARACENTHESIS BE MORE PROPER THAN A COMMON NEEDLE  MAY NOT THE HERNIAL TUMOUR BE PERCEIVED TO BE CHIEFLY FLATULENT BY ITS BEING IN SOME 4645 SOME DEGREE TRANSPARENT UPON APPLYING A CANDLE AS USED IN THE HYDROCELE AND MAY NOT THAT DIRECT THE PROPER PLACE FOR PUNCTURES THESE ARE CONJECTURES BUT I AM WITH GREAT TRUTH AND THE HIGHEST RESPECT S I R YOUR MOST OBLIGED PLYMOUTH JUNE 8 1739 AND MOST OBEDIENT HUMBLE SERVANT J HUXHAM I HAVE TAKEN THE LIBERTY TO FILL UP THIS LETTER WITH A SCHEME OF THE PHASE OF THE SUN OCTOBER 31ST 11H 5 12 AS TAKEN BY MY TELESCOPE WHICH IS A VERY GOOD ONE OF 10 FEET BUT AS I HAD NEITHER CROSSHAIRS MICROMETER OR OTHER EXACT INSTRUMENTS THE OBSERVATION MAY NOT BE VERY EXACT BESIDES I HAD ONLY A GLIMPSE OF THE SUN FOR 7 OR 8 MINUTES APP TIME A SMALL WELLDEFINED 11 5 12 SPOT WHICH I TOOK FOR  THOUGH NOT SO OPAKE AS I EXPECTED   MORE LUCID

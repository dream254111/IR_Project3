AND TAX RATE THOMAS W LAMONT VicePresident of the Academy of Political Science In regard to the financial administration of the city the first ques tion in the minds of bankers always is how can the credit of the city be enhanced As bankers we have a pride in the high credit of the imperial city of New York Its credit is always high but how can it be enhanced And what is the situation today The comp troller has already given you some stupendous figures Even at the risk of repeating some of them I want to point out some of the problems that confront us in financing the city The comptroller has stated that this years budget is 199000000 In 1898 the budget was only 77000000 In that same year the citys debt was 341000000 today it is over 1000000000 or even if you deduct the sinking fund it is between 700000000 and 800000000 The interest alone on New York citys debt is 52000000 a sum largely in excess of the interest on the national debt of the United States How can the bankers enable the city to sell its obligations so as to secure a lower rate of interest Of course one of the first things is for the city to be more economical but that is the province not of bankers but of administrators for the city The city also must spend more wisely what it absolutely has to spend but that again is not the problem of bankers There is one point already alluded to by your chairman which does come within our purview however and that is the laying down of the principle adopted by the present city administration that the city must pay as it goes for its nonproductive expenditures Though past administrators of the city have had no continuity in their financial program and policies they have had continuity in piling up an enormous debt for nonproductive purposes The principle is thor oughly vicious but it has been followed by all previous administrations Mayor Mitchel some time ago stated that 485000000 of the citys present debt was incurred for socalled selfsustaining improvements and 834000000 for nonproductive improvements Consider what that means It is precisely as if a railroad paid for the renewal of its ties and rails each year by issuing its bonds for such improvements or as if an industrial company renewed its machinery with the proceeds of bonds issued on its property There is no doubt what would become of those corporations Yet that was the principle pursued by the city 638FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION Despite its enormous resources it pursued a spendthrift policy and it remained for the present administration to adopt the new policy just at that thrilling time last September when for a moment the citys credit seemed to be almost imperiled It is worth while to review that situation somewhat more in detail In September after the outbreak of the war this city owed abroad in England and in France 80000000 Those debts had very properly been contracted there because the city had been able to borrow at de cidedly lower rates of interest in England and France than in America But there was 80000000 falling due before the first of the year and the good name of the city of New York was involved in meeting those obli gations promptly She did not have the gold to ship and if she had been able to buy the exchange at the rates then prevailing it would have cost her an enormous sum something like 15000000 or 20000000 morebut even so she could not have got the exchange At that junc ture the city authorities appealed not only to the business sense and cooperation but to the patriotism of the bankers of the city of New York It is to the credit of the banking institutions of this city when I say that only one out of the hundred and fifty or more institutions of this city that were invited to cooperate in this matter failed to do so That cooperation took the form of a syndicate organized at the re quest of the city by J P Morgan  Company and Kuhn Loeb  Com pany with prominent associates like the City Bank and others The syndicate arranged that these banking institutions grouped together should agree to buy when presented 100000000 of the citys obligations and of that 100000000 to pay in gold the sum of 80000000 That furnished the gold necessary for export to meet these obligations due on the other side Another condition of the agreement was that the syndi cate should turn back to the city any profits realized over and above 2 in the exchange operation There would be no other profits of any kind but if the syndicate succeeded in handling the exchange situation between America and London and Paris in such a way as to realize a profit of 20 or more any excess was to go back to the city and the syndi cate managers were to receive nothing for their services What was the result of this operation in which the citys credit was so vitally involved The result of it was on the whole to place the citys credit higher than ever before The operation was most successful in every detail The city issued its obligations to the extent of 100 000000 in the form of one two and threeyear notes which were offered by the bankers at the price that they paid for them For those notes there was an unprecedented demand from all over the city and the coun 639 No 3 161THE GOVERNMENT OF NEW YORK CITY VOL V try There were almost six thousand individual applications for these securities The citys obligations were discharged and her credit abroad was placed on a level where it had never been before because she had done what no other country at that time and no other city outside of this country was attempting to do and that was to pay on the dot in gold The sum of almost half a million dollars was turned back to the city being the excess over 2 realized by the syndicate It was at this time as I say that this new and important principle was adopted of paying as we go and that principle took the following form It was to go into effect gradually so as not to derange the taxes too much and even so there is question today whether it may not cause undue derangement Of the amount to be raised for nonproductive expenditures in the first year 1915 25 is to be added to the tax levy and 75 is to be defrayed by selling fifteenyear bonds In the second year 50 is to be raised from the tax levy and 50 from fifteenyear bonds in the third year 75 from the tax levy and 25 from bonds and in the fourth year 1918 the whole amount of nonproductive expendi tures is to be raised from the tax levy itself That principle was of such importance that it seems to me worth while to read to you the resolu tion of the board of estimate and apportionment for you must remem ber that this city administration had for some time been considering this whole question so that when the crisis arose on account of the war the question was by no means new to them The resolution one of the most important ever passed by the board of estimate reads as follows WHEREAS The city of New York for the purpose of meeting its out standing temporary loans to the amount of 100000000 of which there are foreign obligations to the amount of 13310000 and 61500000 francs incurred through the issue of corporate stock notes and revenue notes heretofore issued under and pursuant to provisions of section 189 and 187 of the Greater New York charter and payable between this date and January 1st next AND WHEREAS The extraordinary situation prevailing in the financial market due to the European War makes it imperative to provide for the payment in gold or purchase of exchange or other arrangement for settlement at this time for the full amount of the foreign loan AND WHEREAS The city expects from time to time to become a further borrower in the market for the purpose of financing itself through ensu ing years as heretofore by the issue of revenue bonds and revenue notes in anticipation of taxes and by the issue of corporate stock notes and corporate stock for permanent improvements 640 162FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION AND WHEREAS At the present moment a world condition prevails in financial markets making it exceptionally and extraordinarily diffi cult to secure loans in large sums such as regularly required by the city to provide funds for the discharge of its business in anticipation of col lection of taxes and issue of corporate stock and for this reason it be comes desirable that the city of New York should maintain its credit unimpaired in this period of financial stress and to that end to conform its practises to the most conservative methods of financial management AND WHEREAS The members of this board have contemplated the necessity of adopting a new policy with regard to the financing of per manent public improvements looking to the payment of the expense thereof in increasing proportions out of the budget of the city rather than through the issue of long term bonds and have already adopted such practise in part which intent was further evidenced by the state ment contained in the communication addressed by the mayor to this board in transmittal of the executive budget on August the 14th last AND WHEREAS The present is an appropriate time for the further extension of this policy now therefore be it Resolted That the board of estimate and apportionment hereby declares that it will pursue the following plan in financing public im provements 1 The cost of all improvements of the revenueproducing class such as rapid transit docks railway and water terminals and water supply shall be defrayed by the issue of fiftyyear corporate stock as heretofore 2 The cost of all permanent improvements other than those of the revenueproducing class hereafter authorized by this board shall be financed as follows a Those authorized subsequent to the passage of this resolution and during the year 1915 shall be paid for threequarters by the issue of fifteenyear corporate stock The corporate stock so issued shall mature either in not more than fifteen years amortized as provided by law or in equal annual instalments during a period of not more than fif teen years The remaining onequarter of the cost of such improvements shall be paid through the medium of a oneyear bond payable from the next annual tax budget b Those authorized in the year 1916 shall be paid for onehalf by the issue of corporate stock maturing as aforesaid The remaining onehalf of the cost of such improvements shall be paid through the medium of a oneyear bond payable from the next annual tax budget c Those authorized in the year 1917 shall be paid for onequarter 641 163 No 3THE GOVERNMENT OF NEW YORK CITY VOL V by the issue of corporate stock as aforesaid The remaining threequarters of the cost of such improvements shall be paid through the medium of a oneyear bond payable from the next annual tax budget d The foregoing statements of policy contemplate the financing of improvements authorized during the year 1918 and subsequent years through the inclusion of the entire cost thereof in the annual budget of the city excepting the revenueproducing improvements hereinbefore mentioned 3 In so far as corporate stock notes issued by the city of New York as a part of the proposed loan of 100000000 shall be retired by issues of corporate stock the corporate stock so issued shall mature as pro vided in clauses a b and c of paragraph 2 of these resolutions 4 The cost of public works already authorized whether under contract or not but in respect of which new bonds are to be issued is to be financed in the same manner as above provided with the exception of the cost of revenueproducing improvements hereinbefore mentioned Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to affect either corporate stock or assessment bonds issued to replenish the street improvement fund or the fund for street and park openings That policy means that all the world of investors will understand the determination of this city to pay as it goes It is not going to leave future generations to pay the cost of things enjoyed today that pro duce no revenue In the long run the adoption of that policy will greatly enhance the value of the citys obligations As a last word let me say that the problem is not yet finished It is a problem that requires the cooperation of citizens even more than bankers because the adoption of this remarkable policy by the present administration inevitably means an increase in the tax rate on the citi zens of the city It was bound to be an unpopular move politically It was a daring courageous move and a wise one as well but it was a move that demands the support of the citizens for the increase in the tax rate though a temporary hardship is a severe one Nevertheless this policy in the long run will raise the credit of the city of New York above its already high place and should effect material savings in the future financing of the city EDWIN R A SELIGMAN McVickar Professor of Political Economy Columbia University The subject assigned to me is a perennially old and yet in this particular juncture a particularly new one the selection of new sources of revenue 642 164FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION Why do we need new sources of revenue If we are to believe our watchdog of the treasury whom we are very fortunate to have with us at this time we have no need of new revenue but we can cut our coat according to the cloth If however we are to believe the last speaker there will notwithstanding all possible economies still be the prospect of facing the necessity of new revenues What I want to em phasize is this fact that we are going through a crisis in the history of this city which ought to be met by exceptional measures and the choice is one between cutting to the bone and the less heroic but per haps equally unpopular method of submitting for the time being to fresh burdens Why is it a crisis Ordinarily we have not had this trouble because although the expenditures of this city as of all cities have grown it has been possible to meet them by the increase in the revenues by the ordinary expansion in the basis from which we derive our income Three or four things however have happened in the last year or two which have brought this crisis upon us What are these things In the first place we are building a whole new system of rapid transit That ex penditure will be over in a few years and the earnings will begin to come in In the meantime we have to spend money although we cover the outlay not only by issuing bonds but by borrowing the interest Within a year or two however we shall have to put on the tax levy the interest on these new bonds until the time when the rapid transit system earns this interest That will take a few years In the second place as the preceding speaker has pointed out we have now adopted the policy of pay as you go for the nonproductive capital outlay or the so called nonselfsupporting improvements and as a consequence we shall have to put upon our tax levy every year an increasing amount to pay for these permanent expenditures In the third place ordinarily as I say we might depend upon the increase in the assessments of real estate which in normal times would be several hundred million dollars a year and which would give us an ample margin for the increase in ordinary expenditures For the last year or two however as you know we have been in the depths of a great depression and this depression will probably continue for a short time at least We are therefore caught as you see both coming and going We have more to spend and we have a smaller basis upon which to build a smaller source from which to draw the revenue And finally to cap the climax we are now confronted after several years of quiescence with the outlook of a direct tax for state purposes which this year we are told will amount to at least eighteen or twenty millions of dollars and of which the city will have to pay its 643 165 No 31THE GOVERNMENT OF NEW YORK CITY VOL V large share of 70 Until the state therefore reforms its own system of finance a point carefully to be considered and not easily to be accom plished during this year and during the next few years it is probable that we shall have to look forward to these increased expenses on the one hand lack of increased revenue on the other That I say is the crisis that confronts us and the problem now arises how shall we meet it The comptroller has told you how he would meet it He has done his duty As the watchdog of the treasury it is his duty to keep before us now and at all times the sovereign need of econ omy He has done as much as anyone in the present admirable admin istrationI was going to say almost more than any one elseto point out how in his own department and in all the other departments over which he has indirect control this admirable principle of economy can be achieved He knows whereof he speaks he practises what he preaches And yet I have a little doubt as to whether when the matter is put before the citizenry of New York they will elect when they know what it really means to follow the comptrollers plan For after all the question is not so much one of economy as of choice between economy and parsimony We all agree that we must have economy and the city administration has shown that it follows this plan For as you know in the budget for the coming year we are actually spending for ordinary city purposes less than the year before So far as the ordinary expenses of the city are concerned which ought normally to grow with the growth of population I have no doubt that the comptroller and his associates will be able to keep the budget for the next year notwithstanding the increase of population down considerably below the present figures That is sound economy and it ought assuredly to be practised But when you come to the point of meeting the 25 soon to be the 50 75 or 100 of the nonproductive expenditures for capital purposes and we have been spending on the average from twentyfive to twenty eight million dollars a year for that purpose alone new school houses new court houses and things of that kindwhen you add to that the increased expenses that are coming along for rapid transit and when you add still further our proportion of the immense direct state tax when you have done all that you will realize that we are confronting a situa tion where we shall need not indeed next year but the following year or within three or four years an additional revenue of between 30000000 and 40000000 to put it conservatively We shall then need from thirty to forty millions of dollars more revenue or we have got to lop off from our present expenditures thirty to forty million dollars of ex penditures 644 166FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION The comptroller has told you that so far as the health department is concerned he would not be in favor of lopping off anything because we are getting our moneys worth and more than our moneys worth I imagine that for streets and the taking care of streets there is not an immense amount to be saved although I have no doubt that a few mil lions could well be cut out by careful economy We must then save on schools We are therefore confronted by a situation where we shall have completely to change our whole system of education so as to save not a million or two but ten or fifteen millions out of the thirty or forty millions we are spending for that purpose That means that we shall have to give up all our colleges our high schools our vocational schools and a great part of the recent additions that have been made to our educational plant For even though you abandon pretty much all of what might be called the fads and frills in our educational scheme the comptroller himself has told us that they amount to comparatively little We must remember that it is not a question of economizing half a million here or a million there in the ordinary branches of the administration We are all in favor of that of course nay we must insist upon it But it is a question of choosing whether you are going to cut to the bone in the educational and all the other social services of the city or whether you are going to raise more revenue My own feeling is that if we had come to the point where no more revenue could be raised without great hardship to the community then serious as it would be we should nevertheless be compelled to cut to the bone Why do we spend so much money in modern times The growth of moder expenditure is due to the growth of modern democ racy It is because we realize that on the whole the under dog ought to have as much of a chance as the rest of us to derive some benefit from the blessings of civilization and to have an opportunity at all events to develop himself that the community is beginning to give him a chance through education sanitation recreation and the like We find this growth of expenditures all over the world in Asia in Africa and in Europe in Great Britain in France and Germany as in the United States If then we remember that the normal growth of expenditures is simply the reverse of the shield of progressive democracy to say as we should have to say that we must cut to the bone in order to save these ten twenty or thirty millions of dollars and to say that we must give up all those things which have put New YorkI wont say in the front rank but among the progressive cities of the worldto confess this is to incur the danger of taking a step backward which will react upon the com merce and the industry of this city and which will ultimately injure its prosperity 645 No 3 167THIE GOVERNMENT OF NEW YORK CITY Yet even this I would face if it has to be if we had reached our limit But what is the fact The fact is that we are raising all our revenue in the city practically from one source real estate and the rate on real estate at the present time is indeed such that we cannot well increase it But what should be done is not to compare expenditures with population or even ex penditures with real estate we should compare expenditures with social income The reason why the expenditures of the city have increased so enormously is because of the growth in the social income of the city the income of the people that compose the city Do you know that of the income tax raised in the United States last year between 45 and 47 of the tax paid by individuals on personal income was paid in this city Think of it almost onehalf of the entire taxable incomes in the United States right here and yet they tell us that we cannot afford to keep up the social service of the city and the education in which we believe The trouble is not with our expenditures although I am the greatest possible advocate of economy the trouble is that we have an absurd and inadequate system of revenue The people who pay the taxes in this city are not the poor men directly nor the rich men but the great middle class What we need is a system of taxation a system of raising revenues both local and state which will tap the social income in such a way as to make all classes of the community pay their proper share What did Lloyd George do when he was confronted with the necessity of raising fifty millions more for social insurance He did not say We have taxed real estate as much as we can and therefore we have got to cut to the bone in our expenditures No he said There is a social income in this community and I shall proceed to find it And he found it in ways that have not been spoken of in this country at all What do they do in Germany What do they do in France What do they do in every country in the world except in the state and city of New York when this proposition is before them The mayors tax committee of which I have the honor to be a member is wrestling with one side of that problem and the mayor is not yet ready to make our conclu sions public I would say however that it is not simply a question of a mayors tax committee but of a governors tax committee We in the city of New York are as much interested in having a reformation of the state revenues of which we pay 70 as in having a reformation of the city revenues Until we can get together and consider dispas sionately this problemis there sufficient social income in the state and the imperial city of New York to make possible a continuation of 646 168 VOL VNo 3 FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION 169 the program of sane and sensible social service upon which we have entereduntil we can get an answer to that problem we can make little headway But when as I hope we shall have solved this problem we shall then have no difficulty in making a choice between the two alter natives shall we cut to the bone and abandon so much of what we have already attained or shall we say Yes let us have economy let us have expenditures economically administered but let us have enough revenue out of the social income to make those expenditures possible 647

called the bayalewife clupea nondefcripta arrives in very confiderable flhoals and in fome feafons their number is almoft incredible They are fully of the fize of a large herring and are principally diflinguifhed from the her ring by a bay or red fpot above the gillfin fee the drawing They are when caught from March to May fullroed and fat and are at leaft as good a fifh for the table as the herring In this feafon each of thefe alewives carries in her mouth an infeac abotut two inclhes long hanging with its back downwards and firmly holding itfelf by its I4 legs to the palate The fifliermen call this infe6c the loufe It is with difficulty that it can be feparated and perhaps never without injury to the jaws of the ffih The fifher men tlherefore confider the infect as effential to the life of the fiflh for wlhen it is taken out and the fifli is thrown again into thie water hie is incapable of fwimming and foon dies I endeavoured in numerous ir4tances to pre fcrve both the infeCt and the fifh from injury but was always obliged eitlher to defiroy the one or to injure the othier I have fometimes fulccceded in taking out the infe6t in a lrifk and lively ftate As foon as lhe was fet free from my graf he immediately fcrambled nimbly back into the nmoutlh of the fifh and refumed his pofition In every inftance hie was difguftingly corpulent and un pleafant to handle and it feemed that whether hie have obtained his polt by force or by favor whethcr he be a mere traveller or a conflant refident or what elfe mnay be his btifinefs where he is foiund he certainly has a fit place of it and fares fumptuoufly every day The drawings annexeci to this account were made from the live infe6t and from the fifh ouit of whofe mouth he was taken I had no books to refer to then  but examining the Syftema NaturT of Linnatus I was furprizcd to find fo exadt a dcfcription of the infe6t as follovsONISCUS PREGUSTATOR 79 follows fee Salvii editio Holmiae 1763 p io6o alfo Trattners

May as long as they are caught upon their paffiage up the river they are fouind fat and full of roe Every fiilh which I faw had the onifcus in his mouth and I was affured not only by the more ig

trouble to catch thlem No one could tell me pofi tlizcly whethler the olnifcus ftill continues withl them but it was the opinion of my informant that like every other parafite he deferts his protector in his reduced ftate for hie could not recolleO that he had ever feen himi in the mouth of thofe accidentally caught in the feine in JuLly or AuguR I confider therefore the natural hiftory of the onifcus wxhlich I now communicate as very imperfea  and it were to be wiffhed that fome lover of natural fcience would follow uip the enquiry by endeavoring to af cer tain wvhetlher hie continue with

Needham bring to a conclusion the fourth chapter on  The Wings of Insects which treats of  The Specialization of Wings by Addition and ter minates that portion of the series devoted to furnishing data for determining the homologies of the veins Arnold E Ortmann discusses New Facts lately presented in opposition to the Bipolarity of Marine Faunas stating that they do not at all support the theory of bi polarity and that we must wait for further in vestigation to show whether bipolarity as a relic of older times is realized in the distribu tion of any marine animals The first of the promised  Synopses of North American Inver tebrates by C B Davenport is devoted to the  Freshwater Bryozoa A brief sketch of the habits and habitats of these animals is given followed by a key for their specific determina tion and a bibliography of literature on Fresh water Bryozoa W E Praeger presents some Notes on the Habits of Bascanion Constrictor which contains good evidence as to the climb ing abilities of this snake Leonhard Stejneger under the title A New Name for the Great Crested Anolis of Jamaica shows that there has been a curious unanimity in misnaming this reptile Anolis edwardsii and proposes for it the name of Anolis garmani THE June number of the Journal of the Boston Society of Medical Science brings the third volume of this periodical to a close The index shows that it contains sixtyfive papers con tributed by fortyfive investigators While there is a greater tendency towards patholog ical subjects than formerly there is yet very much of interest to the comparative anatomist In the present number Calvin G Page has a Study of Streptococci isolated from Throat Cultures from Patients Ill with Scarlet Fever and a  Preliminary Report on the Diplococcus of Scarlet Fever Theodore Hough and Bertha G Ballantyne give a Preliminary Note on the Effects of Changes in External Temperature on the Circulation of Blood in the Skin and S A Hopkins presents a preliminary report on  Bacteria and Dental Caries stating that he has not yet been able to deduce from his experi ments any definite laws or positive results Theobald Smith describes and figures Some Devices for the Cultivation of Anaerobic Bac teria in Fluid Media without the Use of Inert Gases DISCUSSION AND CORRESPONDENCE ABOUT A REFORM IN NOMENCLATURE IN the Nomenclator Zoologicus of Scud der 80000 genera are mentioned and there are 7585 genera of phanerogamia Human memory is unable to retain all these arbitrary names languages have from 20000 to 30000 words each and the result of it all is that  the lan guage of science is more difficult than science itself  Even professed naturalists cannot guess what the Mormops megalophylla or the Cero plastes psidii is It is high time to repair this mischief by introducing the reform following 1 The generic names of animals shall end in us those of plants in a and those of minerals in i 2 Minerals shall have a genus formed with the abbreviations of their components Thus Sulphurzinci sphalerita indicates a mineral i a Sulphur Sulph of zinc zinci of the species sphalerita 3 Plants shall have their genus preceded by the abbreviation of their family Thus Rosaspiriea limbata indicates a Rosacea Rose of the genus spiraea and the species limbata plant a 4 The genus of animals shall be relegated to special lists substituting for those in common use the abbreviations of their class and family or order Thus lnscoccidus psidii indicates an animal us insect ins coccidae coccidus be longing to the species psidii The family Coc ciceroplastus psidii is more difficult of inter pretation since at least 1000 families of ani mals have been accepted 5 In case there be two similar species in the same family of animals their genus shall be cited The reform proposed does not alter or change anything but facilitates research as well as the applications popularization and teaching of science There are no future inconveniences in the acceptance of this reform No Inter 120 SCIENCESCIENCE national Congress is required since the abbrevia tions present no difficulties A L HERRERA MUSEO NACIONAL MEXICO TIDES AND CURRENTS IN CANADIAN WATERS To THE EDITOR OF SCIENCE Permit me to invite your attention to the latest report of the engineer in charge of the survey of the tides and currents of the coast waters of Canada Mr W Bell Dawson M A M E etc a copy of which has been addressed to you This survey commenced by the government of Canada in 1894 is of great importance not merely in the interest of hydrographical science but of the large and increasing trade which finds its way along the Gulf and River St Lawrence the greatest waterway from the north Atlantic into the northern part of the American continent and which like all similar tideways is affected by the complex action of the tides and conse quent currents It is much to be regretted that the economy or parsimony of the government has caused a suspension for the present of the special survey of the currents and has restricted the work to tidal observations which though of great value to the shipping interests can only be considered as preliminary in regard to the investigation of the currents themselves which lead to so many losses of property and life and tend to high rates of insurance injurious to the ship owners and merchants of Canada and through them to those of an empire as a whole The present report in addition to what can be done with the insufficient grant allowed in the matter of tidegauges and tidetables has reference to the behavior of the gigantic tides of the Bay of Fundy when confined by the converging coasts at the head of the bay and their relation to the smaller tides on the op posite side of the isthmus connecting Nova Scotia and New Brunswick at Bay Verte on the Gulf of St Lawrence These and the phe nomena of the bore at the head of the Bay of Fundy are here for the first time described illustrated by maps and sections and tabulated and will be found of the greatest interest by all who desire information as to the exceptional tides of this region 121 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE TRES MARIA IS LANDS MEXICO THE latest publication from the Division of Biological Survey of the U S Department of Agriculture being North American Fauna No 14 bears the title at the head of this notice It contains the result of an exploration made in the spring of 1897 by Mr E W Nelson and Mr E A Goldman during the month of May of that year and adds largely to our previous knowledge of the fauna and flora of these is lands The more appropriate title to the paper would be  Contributions to the Natural His tory etc for no insecta are mentioned and only six species of mollusks of these four had not been previously known to occur The author after mentioning the names of Col A J Grayson and Alphonse Forrer says  no other naturalist is known to have visited the islands until the spring of 1897 the season of his visit He should have known that the islands were visited in the spring of 1876 by Mr W J Fisher previously naturalist of the Tuscarora Telegraph Sounding Expedition directed by Commander George E Belknap in 1873 Mr Fisher made a large collection of molluscan forms as published in the Proc U S Nat Museum pp 139204 of Volume XVII 1894 wherein 89 species are listed It is not unlikely that both Grayson and Forrer collected many insect species which have been published somewhere Only the mollusks collected by Fisher have come under my notice ROBERT E C STEARNS Los ANGELES CAL June 26 1899 NOTES ON INORGANIC CHEMISTRY No little work has been done on the com pounds of sulfur and iodin but with no very satisfactory results The latest contribution is by L Prunier in the Journal de la pharmacie et de la chimie and it can hardly be said that the subject is left in a much clearer condition Prunier distinguishes between what he calls iodized sulfur  and  sulfur iodid The former is made by adding the desired quantity of iodin to sulfur at 115 to 120 stirring cooling and preserving in a stoppered bottle The iodin JULY 28 1899

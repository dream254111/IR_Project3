second Comet with Remarks on its Con struction By William Herschel LL D F R S Read March t2 1812 As we have lately had two comets to observe at the same time I have called that of which the following observations are given the second Its appearance has been so totally dif ferent from that of the first that every particular relating to its construction becomes valuable and notwithstanding the unfavourable state of the weather at this time of the year I have been sufficiently successful to obtain a few good views of the phenomena which this comet has affbrded A short detail of the observations in the order of their rela tion to the different cometic appearances is as follows The Body of the Comet January i 1812 I viewed the second comet with several of my telescopes and found it to have a considerable nucleus surrounded with very faint chevelure Jan 2 The comet had a large round nucleus within its faint nebulosity Not seeing it very well defined and of so MDCCCXIr H ho0 Dr HERSCHELS Observations of a second Comet large a diameter I doubted whether it could be the body of the comet but although it might be called very large wheni supposed to be of a planetary construction it was much too small for the condensed light of a head its diameter by esti mation not exceeding 5 or 6 seconds By way of comparing the two comets togetherl viewed them alternately The first within a nebulosity which in the form of a brilliant head was of great extent had nothing resembling a nucleus the light of this head was very gradually much brighter up to the very middle its small planetary body being invisible The second comet on the contrary although sur rounded by a faint chevelure seemed to be all nucleus for the abrupt transition from the central light to that of the che velure would not admit of the idea of a gradual condensation of nebulosity such as I saw in the head of the first comet but plainly pointed out that the nucleus and its chevelure were two distinct objects Jan 8 The comet had a pretty well defined nucleus with very faint chevelure When magnified 170 times the nucleus though less bright was rather better defined Jan 8i Within a very faint chevelure I saw the nucleus as before Jani o The air being uncommonly clear I saw the body of the comet well defined and as the moon was already so far advanced in its orbit as to render future opportunities of viewing the comet very improbable I ascertained the magni tude of its body with a very distinct lo feet reflector by the following three observations First with a low power which gave a bright image of the nucleus I kept my attention fixed upon its apparent size thenwith Remearks on its Construction looking away from the telescope I mentally reviewed the im pression its appearance had made on the imagination in order to see whether it was a faithful picture of the object and by looking again into the telescope I was satisfied of the simi litude In the next place I used a deeper magnifier and alternately viewed and remembered the appearance of tle nucleus It was fainter with this power The third observation was made in the same manner with a magnifier of 170 This showed the nucleus of a larger dia meter but much less bright and not so well defined The next morning having recourse to my usual experiment with a set of globules by viewing them at a given distance with the same telescope and eyeglasses I found that one of them on which I fixed gave me as nearly as could be esti mated the same magnitude with the first eyeglass and was proportionally magnified by the second and third with only this difference that the highest power sliowed the globule with more distinctness than it did the nucleus and by trigonome try the angle under which I saw the globule was found to be 52744 It will be necessary to mention that in tlle calculations be longing to this comet I have used the elements of Mr GAUS with a small correction of the longitude of the perihelion which I found would answer the end of giving the observed place with sufficient accuracy from the 1st of January to the  I prefer this method of ascertaining the small diameter of a faint object to mea suring it with a micrometer which requires light to show the wires and a high magnifying power to give an image sufficiently large for mensuration neither of which conditions the present comet would admit II h a23S Dr HERSCHELS Observations of a second Comet 2oth These calculations may however be repeated if here after we should obtain elements improved by additional obser vations made with fixed instruments but the result I may venture to say will not be materially different The distance of the comet from the earth the o2th of Ja nuary when its apparent diameter was determined was 10867 the mean distance of the earth from the sun being i whence we deduce a very remarkable consequence which is that the real diameter of its nucleus cannot be less than 2637 miles The Chevelure of the Comet Instead of that bright appearance which in the first comet has been considered as the head there was about the nucleus of the second a faint whitish scattered light which may be called its chevelure Jan i Examining the chevelure of the comet with a o feet reflector I found that it surrounded the nucleus not in the form of a head consisting of gradually much condensed nebulosity but had the appearanceof a faint haziness which although of some extent was not much brighter near the nucleus than at a distance from it Jan 2 I viewed the two comets alternately The first could only be distinguished from a bright globular nebula by the scattered light of its tail which was still 2 2o long The second comet on the contrary had nothing in its appearance resembling such a nebula it consisted merely of a nucleus surrounded by a very faint chevelure and had it not been for an extremely faint light in a direction opposite to the sun it would hardly have been intitled to the name of a cometwith Remarks on its Construction eS having rather the appearance of a planet seen through an at mosphere full of haziness Jan 8 The chevelure consisted of so faint a light that when magnified only 170 times it was nearly lost Jan 18 The chevelure was extremely faint and of very little extent Jan 20 The light of the moon which was up would not admit of further accurate observations on the chevelure The Tail of the Comet Jan i With a low magnifying power I saw in the to feet reflector an extremely faint scattered light in opposition to the sun forming the tail of the comet It reached from the centre of the double eyeglass half way toward the circum ference Jan 8 The narrow very faint scattered light beyond the chevelure remains extended in the direction opposite the suln Jan 18 I estimated the length of the tail by the propor lion it bore to the diameter of the field of the eyeglass which takes in 38 39 and found that it filled about one quarter of it which gives 9 40 Jan 20 On account of moonlight the tail was no longer visible From the angle which it subtended in the last observation it will be found that its length must have been about 659 thou sand miles Remarks on the Construction of the Comet The method I have taken in my last paper of comparing together the phenomena of different comets appears to nmee344 Dr HERSCHELS Observations of a second Comet most likely to throw some light upon a subjectwhich still re mains involved in great obscurity When the comet of which the observations have been given in this paper is compared witlh the preceding one it will be found to be extremely dif ferent Its physical construction appears indeed to approach nearly to a planetary condition In its magnitude it bears a considerable proportion to the size of the planets the dia meter of its nucleus being very nrearly onethird of that of the earth The light by which we see it is probably also planetary that Is to say reflected from the sun For were it of a phosphoric selfluminous nature we could hardly account for its little density for instance the very small body of the first comet at the distance of 114 millions of miles from the earth bore a magnifying power of 60o and was even seen better with this than with a lower one  whereas the second notwithstanding its large size and being only at the distance of 103 millions had not light enough to bear conveniently to be magnified 107 times but if we admit this nucleus to be opaque like the bodies of the planets and of a nature not to reflect much light then its distance from the sun which the 2oth of January was above 174 millions of miles will explain the cause of its feeble illumination That the nucleus of this comet was surrounded by an atmo sphere appears from its chevelure which though faint was of considerable extent and the elasticity of this atmosphere may be inferred from the spherical figure of the chevelure proved by its roundness and equal decrease of light at equal distances from the centre  See Observations of the First Cometwith Remarks on its Construction The transparency of the atmosphere isp partly ascertained from our seeing the nucleus through it but may also be in ferred by analogy from an observation of the first comet It will be remembered that an atinosphere of great transparency whichlhad been seen for a long time was lostwhen the comet receded from the sun by the subsidence of some nebulous matter not sufficiently rarified to enter the regions of the tail Now as the existence of this atmosphere when it was no longer visible might have been doubted the luminous matter suspended in it which had already so days obstructed our view of it happened fortunately to be once more elevated the 9th of December and thereby enabled us from its trans parency and capacity of sustaining luminous vapours to ascer tain the continuance of its existence By analogy therefore we may surmise that the faint chevelure of the second comet consists also of the condensation of some remaining phosphoric matter suspended in the lower regions of an elastic transpa rent fluid extending probably far beyond the chevelure witl out our being able to perceive it We might ascribe the little extent and extreme faintness of the tail to the great perihelion distance of the comet if it had not already been proved by the comparative view which in my last paper has been taken of the two comets of 1807 and 1811 that the effect of the solar agency depends entirely uponO the state of the nebulous matter which the comet in its ap proach exposes to the action of the sun Our last comet therefore had probably but little unperihelioned matter in its atmosphere The high consolidation of the matter contained in the second  See Observations of the First Comet 23536 Dr HE RSCHELS Observations of a second Comet comet is also much supported by the different appearance of the two comets in the observation of the 2d of January In order to judge of them properly we must consider their situa tion with regard to the sun and the earth the first comet was Q92 millions of miles from the sun the second only 164 the first was at the same time 262 millions from the earth the second only 83 but notwithstanding the great disadvantage of being 28 millions of miles farther from the sun and about 179 millions farther from the earth the first comet had the luminous appearance of a brilliant head accompanied by a tail 45 millions of miles in length  whereas the second comet so advantageously situated had only a very faint chevelure about its large but faint nucleus with a still fainter tail whose length has been shown not much to exceed half a million If then the effect of the action of the sun on the comets at the time of their perihelion passage is more or less conspicu ous according to the quantity of unperihelioned nebulous matter they contain we may by observation of cometic phe nomena arrange these celestial bodies into a certain order of consolidation from which in the end a considerable insight into their nature and destination may be obtained The three last observed comets for instance will give us already the following results The comet of which this paper contains observations is of such a construction that it was but little more affected by a perihelion passage than a planet would have been This may be ascribed to its very advanced state of consolidation and to its having but a small share of phosphoric or nebulous matter im its construction That of the year 1807 was more affected and althoughwith Remarks on its Construction considerably condensed showed clearly that it conveyed a great quantity of nebulosity to the perihelion passage The comet of last year contained with little solidity a most abundant portion of nebulous matter on which in its approach to the perihelion the action of the sun produced those beau tiful phenomena which have so favourably affbrded an oppor tunity for critical observations MDCCCXI 237 i

is essential to jurisdiction over his person is a question upon which there is much diversity of opinion In some of the States it is sufficient that a guardian ad litem be appointed and appear on the infants behalf while in others it is held that service of process is as indispensable as in case of adult defendants In many States the subject is regulated by statute as it is in Virginia The Virginia statute provides that The proceedings in a suit wherein an infant or insane person is a party shall not be stayed because of such infancy or insanity but the court in which the suit is pending or the judge thereof in vacation shall appoint some discreet and competent attorney at law as guardian ad litem to such infant or insane defendant whether such defendant shall have been served with process or not Va Code 1887 Sec 3255 The Virginia Court of Appeals seems to have been of opinion that service of process was not necessary even before this statute was adopted Parker v Mc Coy 10 Gratt 606 The Supreme Court of the United States holds however that no personal decree can be had against an infant in a Federal court without service of process if the infant be at the time a nonresident of the State though process be dispensed with by a statute of the State in which the court is sitting N Y etc Ins Co v Banqs 103 U S 435a principle which is a corollary from the doctrine of Penzoyer v Neff 95 U S 714 and the long line of subsequent cases affirming it that no personal judgment can in any case be entered against a non resident without personal service of process within the State unless he voluntarily appears See further on the subject of process on infants Valentine v Cooley Meigs Tenn 613s c 33 Am Dec 166 and note Grant v Van Schoonhoven 2 Pai Ch N Y 255s c 37 Am

PRINCIPALThe following distinc tions are to be here observed 1 Notice expressly given to the agent with the design of notifying the principal a Concerning a matter within the scope of the agents employment b Concerring a matter beyond the scope of the agents employment In the first case the notice binds the principal whether communicated to him or not in the second it does not unless communicated 2 Knowledge casually acquired by the agent whether before or after the com mencement of the agency and not communicated to the principal Such knowledge affects the principal only in those matters which the agent actually transacts for himand not even then unless it appear that the knowledge was present in the mind of the agent during the transaction to be affected by it or was acquired so recently as to be presumed to have been in his mind at the time 3 Again if the agent is dealing with the principal for the agents own benefit and his interests are opposed to those of his principal or he is engaged in committing a fraud on his principal or his knowledge is of a confidential character as between counsel and client which cannot lawfully be divulged to another clienthis knowledge as distinguised from notice will not be imputed to the principalVIRGINIA LAW REGISTER The subject is fully discussed in the following authorities Note to Bank of Pittsburg v Whitehead Pa 36 Am Dec

v Bausemer 32 Gratt 225 Johnson v National Exchange Bank 33 Gratt 473 These principles are illustrated in the following examples 1 Notice to the board of directors of a bank in meeting assembled of the in validity of a note offered for discount binds the bank If the note be afterwards dis counted though the discounting officer was not present at the meeting and knew nothing of the infirmity of the note But notice of such infirmity given to the janitor or bookkeeper would not have affected the bank if not actually communicated be cause the discounting of notes is not within the scope of their authority So notice to the brakeman of a railroad company to stop goods in transitu would not operate as a notice to the company Note to Bk of Pittsburg v Whitehead supra 2 The creditor secured in a deed of trust will not be charged with notice of a prior unrecorded judgment by reason of the fact that the trustee who is in a certain sense agent of the creditor made a copy of the judgment a year before as deputy clerk it not appearing that he remembered the existence of the judgment at the time the deed of trust was executed Morrison v Bausemer supra So under similar circum stances where the trustee had formerly been judge of the court and had himself entered the judgment but had forgotten the circumstance Johnson v Nat Exch Bk supra 3 A bank is not affected with notice of equities attaching to a note offered for dis count by one of its directors for his own benefit though he himself have full knowl edge on the subject First Nat Bk v Christopher N J 8 Am Rep 403 note to Bk of

and the bank afterwards discounts the note the president taking no part in the transaction and the other officers being ignorant of such equities the bank is not bound by this knowledge of its president though it would have been otherwise had he taken part in discounting the note or had express notice of such equities been served on him officially even though he had subsequently forgotten

trespasses they are re sponsible for all his trespasses committed under color of his office Thus if he utters a slander or commits an assault growing out of a private quarrel his sureties would not be responsible But if he should arrest A on a writ against B or take the goods of C on an execution against D or needlessly assault a prisoner June 154

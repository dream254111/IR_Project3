J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107474,NEW EXPERIMENTS ON SOME OF THE COMBINATIONS OF PHOSPHORUS,I206973,XVII N EXPERMENTS ON SOME OF THE COMBINATIONS OFPHOSHORUS BY SIR H DAVY LLD F R S VICE PRES R L READ APRIL 9 1818 IN A PAPER PUBLISHED IN THE TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY FOR I181 I HAVE DETAILED A NUMBER OF EXPERIMENTS ON PHOS PHORUS FROM WHICH I DEDUCED THE COMPOSITION OF SOME OF ITS COMPOUNDS WITH OXYGEN WITH HYDROGEN AND WITH CHLORINE SINCE THE APPEARANCE OF THIS PAPER VARIOUS RESEARCHES HAVE BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD ON THE SAME SUBJECT IN WHICH SOME RESULTS DIFFERING VERY MUCH FROM EACH OTHER AND FROM MINE ARE STATED I VENTURED TO CONCLUDE THAT THE PHOSPHORIC ACID CONTAINED DOUBLE THE QUANTITY OF OXYGEN TO THAT IN THE PHOS PHOROUS ACID AND THAT PHOSPHORIC ACID CONTAINED ABOUT 3 OF ITS WEIGHT OF OXYGEN M BERZELIUS CONSIDERS THE OXYGEN IN PHOSPHORIC ACID TO BE 12817 AND M DULONG 145 THE PHOSPHORUS BEING 0OO M DULONG AND M BERZELIUS SUPPOSE THE QUANTITY OF OXYGEN IN PHOSPHOROUS ACID TO BE TO THAT IN PHOSPHORIC ACID AS 3 TO 5 THE MOTIVE WHICH IMMEDIATELY INDUCED ME TO RESUME THE ENQUIRY RESPECTING THE PHOSPHORIC COMBINATIONS WAS M DU LONGS PAPER THIS INGENIOUS CHEMIST HAS NOT ONLY ENDEA VOURED TO ESTABLISH NEW PROPORTIONS IN THE KNOWN COMPOUNDS OF PHOSPHORUS BUT HAS LIKEWISE ATTEMPTED TO PROVE THE EXISTENCE OF TWO NEW ACIDS OF PHOSPHORUS AND HAS DENIED SEVERAL FACTS WHICH I CONSIDERED AS SUFFICIENTLY ESTABLISHED THE DETAILS WHICH I HAVE TO LAY BEFORE THE SOCIETY IN THE C 316 3SIR I DAVYS NEW EPERIMENTS ON PHOSPHORUS FOLLOWING PAGES WILL SERVE TO CORRECT AND FIX I HOPE WITH TOLERABLE ACCURACY THE PROPORTIONAL NUMBER OR EQUIVALENT OF PHOSPHORUS AND AT THE SAME TIME WILL SHOW THE TRUTH OF THE GENERAL SERIES OF PROPORTIONS THAT I ASSIGNED TO ITS COMPOUNDS IN A CASE WHERE MY CONCLUSIONS DIFFER SO MATERIALLY FROM THOSE OF M BERZELIUS AND DULONG IT MAY BE SUPPOSED THAT I HAVE NOT ADOPTED THEM WITHOUT CONSIDERABLE CAUTION AND I HAVE PREFERRED MY OWN RESULTS TO THEIRS ONLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED BY MINUTE AND REPEATED EXPERIMENTS I WAS CERTAIN FROM VARIOUS EXPERIMENTS MADE BOTH LONG AGO AND RECENTLY AND THE RESULTS OF WHICH HAD BEEN CONFIRMED BY MR BRANDE THAT THE PROPORTION OF OXYGENWHICH M DULONG ASSIGNS TO PHOSPHORIC ACID IS CONSIDERABLY SMALLER THAN THAT DENOTED BY THE COMBUSTION OF SMALL QUANTITIES OF PHOSPHORUS IN OXYGEN GAS I KNEW THAT MINUTE PORTIONS OF PHOSPHURETTED HYDROGEN WERE SEPARATED FROM PHOSPHORUS BY VOLTAIC ELECTRI CITY AND IT OCCURRED TO ME AS POSSIBLE THAT WATER MIGHT BE FORMED IN THE COMBUSTION OF PHOSPHORUS AND SEPARATED FROM THE PHOSPHORIC ACID WHEN IT ENTERED INTO SALINE AND METALLIC COMBINATIONS TO ASCERTAIN IF THIS WERE THE CASE I PASSED PHOSPHORUS TO SATURATION THROUGH RED HOT LIME IN A GREEN GLASS TUBE CONNECTED WITH A MERCURIOPNEUMATIC APPARATUS THE COMBINATION TOOK PLACE WITH VIVID IGNITION BUT NO ELASTIC FLUID WAS PRODUCED A PORTION OF THE PHOSPHURET OF LIME FORMED WAS INTRODUCED INTO A TRAY OF PLATINUM AND HEATED IN A GLASS RETORT FILLED WITH OXYGEN GAS THE PHOSPHURET OF LIME BURNT BRILLIANTLY AND BECAME PARTLY CONVERTED INTO PHOSPHATE OF LIME BUT ON RESTORING THE ORIGINAL TEMPERATURE OF THE RETORT THERE WAS NO APPEARANCE OF VAOUR OR OF MOISTURE HAVING EXAMINED THE PHOSPHATE OF LIME FORMED IN THIS SI7SIR H DAVYS NEW EXPERIMENTS ON SOME OPERATION AND SATISFIED MYSELF THAT IT WAS THE SAME AS THAT FORMED BY OTHER METHODS IT BECAME EVIDENT THAT THERE WERE NO SOURCES OF ERROR IN THE EXPERIMENTS ON THE COMBUSTION OF PHOSPHORUS IN OXYGEN GAS ARISING FROM THE FORMATION OR SEPARATION OF WATER AND THE ONLY CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH COULD BE URGED AGAINST THE ACCURACY OF PROCESSES ON THIS COMBUSTION WAS THE SMALL QUANTITY OF MATERIALS ON WHICH THEY HAD BEEN MADE THE VIVIDNESS AND RAPIDITY OF THE COMBUSTION OF PHOSPHORUS RENDERS IT IMPOSSIBLE TO BURN CONSIDERABLE QUANTITIES OF PHOS PHORUS IN THE COMMON WAY IN GLASS VESSELS PHOSPHURET OF LIME BURNS MUCH MORE SLOWLY AND LESS INTENSELY I ENDEAVOURED TO ASCERTAIN THE QUANTITY OF OXYGEN ABSORBED BY A GIVEN WEIGHT OF PHOSPHORUS CONVERTED INTO PHOSPHURET OF LIME BUT THE EXPERIMENT DID NOT SUCCEED THOUGH THE PHOSPHURET OF LIME WAS IN FINE POWDER AND DISTRIBUTED OVER A LARGE SURFACE YET THE PHOSPHATE OF LIME WHICH FORMED AND FUSED ON THE EXTERIOR DEFENDED THE INTERIOR OF THE PHOSPHURET FROM THE ACTION OF THE OXYGEN AND PREVENTED ITS COMBUSTION AFTER VARIOUS UNSUCCESSFUL TRIALS TO CONVERT CONSIDERABLE QUANTITIES OF PHOSPHORUS INTO PHOSPHORIC ACID BY COMBINATIONS CONTAINING OXYGEN I AT LAST THOUGHT OF A VERY SIMPLE MODE OF BURNING PHOSPHORUS WHICH ANSWERED PERFECTLY PHOSPHORUS REQUIRES A CONSIDERABLE HEAT FOR ITS VOLATILI ZATION BY INCLOSING IT IN A SMALL TUBE SO CONSTRUCTED THAT THE PHOSPHORUS CAN BURN IN VAPOUR ONLY FROM THE APERTURE OF E A SOURCE OF ERROR MIGHT BE SUSPECTED IN CARBON COMBINED WITH PHOSPHORUS BUT I HAVE BEEN CONVINCED BY EXPERIMENTS MADE ON THE ACTION OF CHLORINE ON THE PHOSPHORUS I EMPLOYED THAT IT CONTAINED NO APPRECIABLE QUANTITY OF CARBON I SUSPECT THAT WHAT IS OFTEN TAKEN FOR CARBURET OF PHOSPHORUS IS IN REALITY A RED OXIDEOF THE COMBINATIONS OF PHOSPHORS THE TUBE LARGE QUANTITIES OF IT MAY BE BURNT BY THE HEAT OF A SPIRIT LAMP IN A RETORT FILLED WITH OXYGEN AND THE ABSORPTION OF OXYGEN AND THE QUANTITY OF PHOSPHORIC ACID FORMED MAY BE MINUTELY ASCERTAINED THE ACCOMPANYING SKETCH P1 XVIII WILL GIVE AN IDEA OF THE APPARATUS THE NECK OF THE LITTLE CURVED TUBE OR SMALL DIS TILLING RETORT AFTER THE PHOSPHORUS IS INTRODUCED IS DRAWN OUT AND AN APERTURE LEFT OF ABOUT I OF AN INCH IT SHOULD NOT BE SMALLER OR IT BECOMES CHOAKED BY THE PHOSPHORIC ACID FORMED REGULATING THE HEAT BY RAISING OR LOWERING THE SPIRIT LAMP THE COMBUSTION MAY BE CARRIED ON SLOWLY OR RAPIDLY AT PLEASURE OPERATING IN THIS WAY I HAVE OFTEN BURNT FROM 5 TO LO GRAINS OF PHOSPHORUS WITHOUT ANY ACCIDENT AND ASCERTAINED EXACTLY THE QUANTITY OF OXYGEN ABSORBED THERE IS ONLY ONE SOURCE OF ERRORA QUANTITY OF PHOSPHORUS REMAINS IN THE UPPER PART OF THE TUBE WHICH CANNOT BE BURNT EXCEPT BY A GREATER HEAT THAN THE RETORT WILL BEAR AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN THE PRECISE WEIGHT OF THIS AS THE TUBE ALWAYS UNITES WITH SOME PHOSPHORIC ACID WHERE IT IS RED HOT AT ITS MOUTH BUT THIS CAN BE ONLY A TRIFLING SOURCE OF ERROR IN THESE EXPERIMENTS AND IN ALL THE OTHERS DETAILED IN THIS PAPER I RECEIVED MUCH USEFUL ASSISTANCE FROM MR FARADAY OF THE ROYAL INSTITUTION AND MUCH OF THEIR VALUE IF THEY SHALL BE FOUND TO POSSESS ALY WILL BE OWING TO HIS ACCURACY AND STEADINESS OF MANIPULATION EXPERIMENT I SIX GRAINS OF PHOSPHORUS THE SMALL TUBE WITH THE PHOS PHORUS WEIGHED BEFORE THE COMBUSTION 565 GRAINS AFTER THE 319SIR H DAVYS NEW EXPERIMENTS ON SOME COMBUSTION 509 SO THAT IT HAD INCREASED L AND THIS INCREASE WAS IN GREAT MEASURE FROM PHOSPHORUS THAT HAD ESCAPED COMBUSTION AND WHEN THIS WAS BURNT OUT BY A STRONG RED HEAT THE INCREASE OF WEIGHT OF THE TUBE WAS UNDER  SO THAT AT LEAST 59 OF PHOSPHORUS HAD BEEN CON VERTED INTO ACID 235 CUBICAL INCHES OF OXYGEN WERE AB SORBED THERMOMETER BEING AT 46 FAHRENHEIT BAROMETER 296 INCHES EXPERIMENT II TEN GRAINS OF PHOSPHORUS THE GLASS TUBE CONTAINING THE PHOSPHORUS WEIGHED LO31 GRAINS AFTER THE EXPERIMENT 956 BUT MUCH PHOSPHORUS REMAINED UNCONSUMED AFTER THE TUBE HAD BEEN HEATED TO REDNESS IT WEIGHED 94 GRAINS SO THAT AT LEAST 84 GRAINS OF PHOSPHORUS WERE CONSUMED IN THE FIRST PROCESS THE ABSORPTION OF GAS WAS 34 CUBICAL INCHES BAROMETER 298 THERMOMETER 47 EXPERIMENT III TEN GRAINS OF PHOSPHORUS BY WEIGHING THE TUBE AFTER THE EXPERIMENT AND THEN DISTILLING AND BURNING THE RESIDUAL PHOSPHORUS IT WAS FOUND THAT 91 GRAINS OF PHOSPHORUS HAD BEEN BURNT WHICH HAD ABSORBED 3525 CUBICAL INCHES OF OXYGEN BAROMETER 297 THERMOMETER 49 FAHRENHEIT I GIVE THESE EXPERIMENTS AS THE MOST ACCURATE I HAVE MADE THE PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE VARY SO LITTLE THAT THE CORREC TIONS FOR THEM ARE OF NO IMPORTANCE SUPPOSING THAT IOO CU BICAL INCHES OF OXYGEN THE BAROMETER BEING BETWEEN 298 AND 296 AND THE THERMOMETER BETWEEN 46 AND 490 FAHRENHEIT WEIGH 339 GRAINS PHOSPHORIC ACID WILL BE COMPOSED ACCORD ING TO THE FIRST RESULT OF LO0 PHOSPHORUS TO 135 OXYGEN  32OF THE COMBINATIONS OF PHOSPHORUS ACCORDING TO THE SECOND OF IOO TO 8172 AND ACCORDING TO THE THIRD OF OO TO 1313 THE MEAN WILL BE TOO TO 1345 THE LIGHT OF THE PHOSPHORUS BURNING IN VAPOUR IN THESE EXPERIMENTS WAS EXCESSIVELY BRIGHT YET THE TOP OF THE RETORT NEVER BECAME SOFTENED AND THE PHOSPHORIC ACID WHICH IN CREASED THE WEIGHT OF THE TUBE PRINCIPALLY COMBINED WITH THE GLASS AT THE APERTURE WHERE IT WAS RED HOT I CANNOT BUT CONSIDER THIS PROCESS OF BURNING PHOSPHORUS IN THE GASEOUS STATE IN A GREAT EXCESS OF OXYGEN AS THE MOST ACCURATE MODE THAT HAS YET BEEN DEVISED FOR ASCERTAINING THE COMPOSITION OF PHOSPHORIC ACID IN THIS INSTANCE NO PHOSPHOROUS ACID AS I ASCERTAINED BY DIRECT TRIALS IS FORMED FROM THE VAPOUR AND NO SUBSTANCES ARE CONCERNED EXCEPT THOSE THAT ACTUALLY COM BINE M DULONGS METHOD OF ASCERTAINING THE COMPOSITION OF PHOSPHORIC ACID APPEARS TO ME MUCH TOO COMPLICATED TO AFFORD ANY RESULTS APPROACHING TO ACCURACY HE FIRST COM BINES COPPER WIRE WITH PHOSPHORUS BY PASSING PHOSPHORUS OVER IT BY MEANS OF A STREAM OF HYDROGEN GAS HE THEN DISSOLVES HIS PHOSPHURET OF COPPER IN NITRIC ACID AND DETER MINES THE QUANTITY OF PHOSPHORIC ACID FORMED BY PRECIPITATION IN ALL OF WHICH PROCESSES SOURCES OF ERROR MAY EXIST M BERZELIUSS METHODS OF ASCERTAINING THE COMPOSITION OF PHOSPHORIC ACID THAT OF REVIVING GOLD FROM ITS OXIDE BY MEANS OF PHOSPHORUS AND THAT OF DETERMINING THE QUANTITIES OF PHOSPHATE AND MURIATE OF SILVER FORMED FROM PERPHOS PHORANE OR THE PERCHLORIDE OF PHOSPHORUS APPEAR TO ME STILL MORE EXCEPTIONABLE YET HIS RESULTS ON THE QUANTITY OF OXYGEN APPROACH NEARER TO MINE THAN THOSE OF M DULONG THE FACTS WHICH I ENDEAVOURED TO ESTABLISH RESPECTING CHLORINE IN A PAPER PUBLISHED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSAC 381SIR H DAVYS NEW EXPERIMENTS ON SOME TIONS FOR 1810 SHOW THAT THE PROPORTIONAL OR EQUIVALENT VOLUME IN WHICH CHLORINE COMBINES IS TO THAT IN WHICH OXYGEN COMBINES AS 2 TO I AND IT FOLLOWS THAT 1O GRAINS OF PHOS PHORUS IN FORMING THE WHITE SUBLIMATE OR PERCHLORIDE OUGHT TO COMBINE WITH BETWEEN 76 AND 8O CUBICAL INCHES OF CHLORINE IN EXPERIMENTS THAT I FORMERLY MADE ON THIS SUBJECT BY ADMITTING CHLORINE TO PHOSPHORUS IN EXHAUSTED VESSELS AND ASCERTAINING THE ABSORPTION BY INTRODUCING SOLUTION OF CHLORINE I OVERRATED THE ABSORPTION I DID NOT AT THAT TIME KNOW WHAT I HAVE SINCE ASCERTAINED THAT A SOLUTION OF CHLORINE IN WATER APPARENTLY SATURATED WITH CHLORINE BY AGITATION WITH IT IN LONG NARROW VESSELS WILL STILL TAKE UP MORE BY EXPOSURE TO A GREAT SURFACE OF CHLORINE IN LARGER VESSELS UNDER ALL CIRCUM STANCES IT IS DIFFICULT TO GAIN VERY PRECISE RESULTS IN EXPERI MENTS ON THE ACTION OF PHOSPHORUS ON CHLORINE MERCURY ACTS SO RAPIDLY UPON CHLORINE THAT IT CANNOT BE EMPLOYED IN EXPERIMENTS IN WHICH THE ABSORPTION IS TO BE DETERMINED WHEN COMMON WATER IS USED SOME OF THE GAS IS ABSORBED BY THE WATER AND THE SUBLIMATE BEING A VERY VOLATILE SUBSTANCE ITS VAPOUR ALWAYS INCREASES THE VOLUME OF THE RESIDUAL GAS SOME AQUEOUS VAPOUR LIKEWISE IN EXPERIMENTS OVER WATER ENTERS WITH THE GAS WHICH FORMS A VOLATILE HYDRATE THE EFFECT OF WHICH IS LIKEWISE TO DIMINISH THE APPARENT ABSORP TION OF CHLORINE I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND THE ABSORPTION GREATEST WHEN I HAVE OPERATED IN SMALL RETORTS CONNECTED BY SMALL STOPCOCKS WITH THE VESSEL CONTAINING THE CHLORINE OVER WATER MAKING THE PROPER CORRECTIONS FOR THE ABSORPTION BY THE WATER THE APPA RENT ABSORPTION HAS BEEN FROM 85 TO 38 CUBICAL INCHES FOR EVERY 5 GRAINS OF PHOSPHORUS S22OF THE COMBINATIONS OF PHOSPHORUS M DULONGS TWO METHODS OF ASCERTAINING THE QUANTITY OF CHLORINE IN THE SUBLIMATE APPEAR TO ME AT LEAST AS OBJECTION ABLE AS HIS PROCESS FOR DETERMINING THE COMPOSITION OF PHOS PHORIC ACID AND LIABLE TO GREAT ERRORS THE FIRST FROM THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE ABSOLUTE QUANTITY OF CHLORINE ADMITTED AND THE SECOND FROM THE LOSS ARISING FROM THE VAPOUR OF THE SUB LIMATE WHICH MUST BE CARRIED OFF BY THE CURRENT OF CHLORINE HOW GREAT A DEFICIENCY MAY ORIGINATE FROM THE LAST CIRCUM STANCE IS SHOWN BY THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENT 5 GRAINS OF PHOSPHORUS WERE CONVERTED INTO SUBLIMATE BY CHLORINE IN GREAT EXCESS THE REMAINING CHLORINE WAS DISPLACED BY PASSING COMMON AIR THROUGH THE VESSEL FOR SOME TIME TILL NOT THE SLIGHTEST SMELL OF CHLORINE COULD BE PERCEIVED THE RETORT WAS THEN WEIGHED AND A CURRENT OF AIR PASSED THROUGH IT THOUGH THIS CURRENT COULD HARDLY HAVE REPLACED THE AIR CONTAINED IN THE RETORT YET THE LOSS OF WEIGHT WAS 17 GRAINS AND COPIOUS VAPOURS WERE PRODUCED IN THE ATMOSPHERE IN A SECOND TRIAL OF THE SAME KIND THERE WAS A GREATER LOSS OF WEIGHT AND BY BARELY EXHAUSTING THE RETORT AND THEN AGAIN ADMITTING AIR THERE WAS A LOSS OF L OF A GRAIN WHEN CHLORINE IS MADE TO ACT UPON PHOSPHORUS OVER MER CURY NOT CAREFULLY DRIED SOME MURIATIC ACID GAS IS ALWAYS FORMED BUT WHEN THE MERCURY HAS BEEN RECENTLY BOILED NO EFFECT OF THIS KIND IS PRODUCED AND THE VAPOUR IN THE GAS FORMS A MINUTE QUANTITY OF A LIQUID HYDRATE OF THE PERCHLORIDE WHICH BY MORE WATER IS CONVERTED INTO MURIATIC AND PHOS PHORIC ACIDS AS I PROVED BY SOME VERY DELICATE EXPERIMENTS SO THAT THERE IS CERTAINLY NO HYDROGEN DENOTED IN PHOSPHORUS BY THE ACTION OF CHLORINE AND IN THEIR MUTUAL ACTION A MERE BINARY COMPOUND OF THE TWO SUBSTANCES IS FORMED MDCCCXVIII UU 323SIR H DAVYS NEW EXPERIMENTS ON SOME AFTER REFLECTING MUCH UPON THE METHODS OF COMBINING CHLORINE AND PHOSPHORUS SO AS TO GAIN CORRECT RESULTS IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT IN OPERATING OVER WATER AND INTRODUCING A PERFECTLY SATURATED SOLUTION OF CHLORINE TO ABSORB THE VAPOUR OF THE SUBLIMATE AND OF ITS HYDRATE FORMED FROM THE WATER IN THE CHLORINE I SHOULD GAIN A RESULT NEARLY CORRECT I MADE AN EXPERIMENT IN THIS WAY ON 4 GRAINS OF PHOSPHORUS IN A RETORT CONTAINING 13 CUBICAL INCHES I ASCERTAINED THE ABSORP TION INTRODUCED INTO THE RETORT A TUBE CONTAINING ABOUT HALF A CUBICAL INCH OF SATURATED SOLUTION OF CHLORINE AND SUFFERED THE FLUID SLOWLY TO ACT UPON THE SUBLIMATE COOLING THE RETORT BY IMMERSION IN WATER I THEN ASCERTAINED THE DEGREE OF THE SECOND ABSORPTION WHICH WAS NEARLY A CUBICAL INCH AND A HALF I LIKEWISE ASCERTAINED THAT WATER HAD ITS POWERS OF DISSOLVING CHLORINE DIMINISHED AND NOT INCREASED BY UNITING WITH PHOS PHORIC AND MURIATIC ACIDS SO THAT THE APPARENT ABSORPTION MUST HAVE BEEN LESS THAN THE REAL ONE ADDING THE SECOND ABSORPTION TO THE FIRST AND MAKING THE PROPER CORRECTIONS THE QUANTITY OF CHLORINE UNITING TO 4 GRAINS OF PHOSPHORUS WAS 319 CUBICAL INCHES BAROMETER BEING 8O INCHES AND THERMOMETER 46 FAHRENHEIT RATHER A LARGER PROPORTION WOULD BE GIVEN IF THE CORRECTION FOR THE PRESENCE OF VAPOUR HAD BEEN MADE FOR SOME OF THE OTHER EXPERIMENTS AND THE RESULT AGREES EXACTLY WITH THE MEAN DEDUCED FROM THE ABSORPTION OF OXYGEN IN THE FORMATION OF PHOSPHORIC ACID FOR ASSUMING THAT TOO CUBICAL INCHES OF CHLORINE WEIGH 765 GRAINS THEN THE SUBLIMATE WILL CONSIST OF I OF PHOSPHORUS TO NEARLY 6 OF CHLORINE AND TAKING THE COMPOSITION OF PHOSPHORIC ACID FROM THIS DATUM IT WOULD CONSIST OF LOO OF PHOSPHORUS AND 1S5 OF OXYGEN S24OF THE COMBINATIONS OFPHOSPHORUS 3 TO ASCERTAIN THE COMPOSITION OF PHOSPHOROUS ACID I USED A NEW METHOD THAT OF CONVERTING THE PERCHLORIDE OF PHOSPHORUS OR PERPHOSPHORANE BY PHOSPHORUS INTO THE CHLORIDE WHICH AFFORDS PHOSPHOROUS ACID BY THE ACTION OF WATER THIS IS EASILY DONE BY HEATING THEM TOGETHER IN A CLOSE RETORT AND IT ENABLES US TO DETERMINE WITH CERTAINTY WHICH OPINION IS CORRECT THAT ASSUMING THE OXYGEN IN PHOSPHOROUS ACID TO BE 8 OR THAT WHICH SUPPOSES IT TO BE 25 THE OXYGEN IN PHOSPHORIC ACID BEING 5 5 GRAINS OF PHOSPHORUS WERE CONVERTED INTO PERCHLORIDE IN A SMALL RETORT OF THE CAPACITY OF 6 CUBICAL INCHES IT WAS NECESSARY TO EXHAUST THIS RETORT TWICE TO REMOVE THE RESIDUAL COMMON AIR MIXED WITH THE CHLORINE AND SOME PERCHLORIDE MUST HAVE BEEN LOST DURING THIS PROCESS A SMALL QUANTITY OF CHLORINE WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN LITTLE MORE THAN SUFFICIENT TO COMPENSATE FOR THE LOSS REMAINED IN THE RETORT 5 GRAINS OF PHOSPHORUS WERE INTRODUCED AND THE RETORT SUFFERED TO REMAIN FILLED PRINCIPALLY WITH COMMON AIR HEAT WAS VERY SLOWLY APPLIED ALL THE PHOSPHORUS EXCEPT AN ATOM NOT SO BIG AS THE HEAD OF A SMALL PIN DISAPPEARED AND A LITTLE OF THE SUBLIMATE STILL REMAINED WHEN THE RETORT BURST FROM THE EX PANSION OF THE VAPOUR OF THE NEW CHLORIDE FORMED BUT THE CHLORIDE FOUND ON THE FRAGMENTS WAS PURE AND HELD NO PHOS PHORUS IN SOLUTION A SECOND EXPERIMENT WAS MADE IN A RETORT OF THE CAPACITY OF 11 CUBICAL INCHES 5 GRAINS OF PHOSPHORUS WERE CONVERTED INTO PERCHLORIDE THE RETORT WAS TWICE COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED BY WHICH AT LEAST A GRAIN AND A HALF OR TWO GRAINS OF PERCHLO RIDE MUST HAVE BEEN LOST 5 GRAINS OF PHOSPHORUS WERE INTRODUCED A LITTLE OF THE SUBLIMATE WAS LOST BY FALLING INTOSIR H DAVY NEW EXPERIMENTS ON SOME THE STOPCOCK OF THE RETORT YET THE CONVERSION OF THE PHOS PHORUS BY HEAT INTO THE LIQUOR WAS ALMOST COMPLETE THERE REMAINED ONLY A MINUTE FRAGMENT IN THIS EXPERIMENT HOWEVER THE LIQUOR HELD PHOSPHORUS IN SOLUTION WHEN THIS PHOSPHORUS WAS PRECIPITATED BY WATER AND OBTAINED WITH THE FRAGMENT BY SUBLIMATION IN A SMALL GLASS TUBE IT DID NOT EQUAL I6 OF A GRAIN AND WAS NO MORE THAN COULD BE EXPECTED FROM THE LOSS OF THE SUBLIMATE THESE TWO EXPERIMENTS PROVE DISTINCTLY THAT THE OXYGEN IN PHOSPHOROUS ACID IS HALF THAT IN PHOSPHORIC ACID FOR IF THE PROPORTION HAD BEEN THAT WHICH M DULONG AND M BERZELIUS INDICATE 167 GRAINS OF PHOSPHORUS AT LEAST OUGHT TO HAVE REMAINED AFTER THE ACTION OF THE SUBLIMATE A COLLATERAL EXPERIMENT WAS MADE 327 GRAINS OF THE FLUID CHLORIDE MADE BY PASSING PHOSPHORUS THROUGH CORROSIVE SUBLIMATE IN GREAT EXCESS WERE ACTED ON BY WATER AND PRE CIPITATED BY NITRATE OF SILVER THE PRECIPITATE WAS IMMEDIATELY SEPARATED FROM THE FLUID AFTER IT HAD BEEN GREATLY DILUTED WITH DISTILLED WATER DISTILLED WATER WAS THEN REPEATEDLY PASSED THROUGH IT AND IT WAS DRIED AND FUSED WHEN IT WEIGHED 984 GRAINS WHICH ALLOWING 245 PER CENT OF CHLORINE IN HORN SILVER WOULD GIVE THE COMPOSITION OF THE FLUID CHLORIDE AS 241O8 OF CHLORINE AND 8592 OF PHOSPHORUS THE COMPARATIVE QUANTITY OF PRECIPITATE IN THIS EXPERIMENT WAS SO MUCH LESS THAN I HAD FOUND IN A FORMER EXPERIMENT THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THE CARE WITH WHICH THE PROCESS HAD BEE CONDUCTED I RESOLVED TO MAKE SOME MORE EXPERIMENTS OF THE SAME KIND IN THE FIRST IN WHICH THE DECOMPOSITION BY WATER WAS MADE IN A SMALL BOTTLE FROM WHICH NO VAPOUR COULD SCAPE AND IN WHICH I SUPERINTENDED THE WEIGHING AND DRYING S26OF THE COMBINATIONS OF PHOSPHORUS OF THE HORN SILVER FORMED WITH THE GREATEST CARE 184 OF THE LIQUID CHLORIDE AFFORDED ONLY 545 OF CHLORIDE OF SILVER WHICH AGREES AS NEARLY AS COULD BE EXPECTED WITH THE FORMER EXPE RIMENT IN TWO OTHER EXPERIMENTS MADE WITH EQUAL CARE AND IN WHICH THE LIQUID WAS POURED INTO A SOLUTION OF NITRATE OF SILVER 6 GRAINS GAVE 171 OF HORN SILVER AND 294 GAVE 899 OF FUSED HORN SILVER IN EXAMINING MINUTELY THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE ACTION OF THE LIQUID CHLORIDE OR SOLUTIONS CONTAINING PHOSPHOROUS AND MURIATIC ACIDS OR NITRATE OF SILVER I FOUND NO DIFFICULTY IN EXPLAINING THE CAUSE OF THE ERROR IN THE FORMER EXPERIMENTS PHOSPHOROUS ACID ACTS UPON NITRATE OF SILVER AND MORE RAPIDLY IN PROPORTION TO ITS CONCENTRATION AND GRADUALLY PRODUCES A COPIOUS PRECIPITATE FROM IT SO THAT IF THERE BE AN EXCESS OF NITRATE OF SILVER AND THE PRECIPITATE BE NOT IMME DIATELY SEPARATED FROM THE SOLUTION THERE IS ALWAYS A CONSI DERABLE INCREASE OF WEIGHT M DULONG AND M BERZELIUS WHOSE EXPERIMENTS AGREE WITH MY FORMER ONES MAY HAVE BEEN MISLED BY A PRECIPITATION FROM THE NITRATE OF SILVER BY PHOSPHOROUS ACID AS I AM SURE I WAS M BERZELIUS DOES NOT STATE HOW HE PREPARED HIS LIQUID CHLORIDE OF PHOSPHORUS BUT M DULONG WHO OBJECTS TO MY PROCESS BY CORROSIVE SUBLIMATE AND EMPLOYS INSTEAD OF IT THE ACTION OF CHLORINE ON PHOSPHORUS IN FORMING HIS FLUID MUST HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO OTHER SOURCES OF ERROR HE SPEAKS OF ACTING ON DRY PHOS PHORUS BY DRY CHLORINE BUT IT MUST BE ALWAYS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO FREE A GAS THAT CANNOT BE KEPT OVER MERCURY OF ALL ITS VAPOUR AND AS PERCHLORIDE ALWAYS FORMS DURING THE ACTION OF PHOSPHORUS ON CHLORINE A PART OF WHICH PRODUCES A FLUID AND EASILY VOLATILE HYDRATE WITH WATER AND SOLUBLE IN 397SIR H DAVYS NEW EXPERIMENTS ON SOME 11 PROPORTIONS IN THE LIQUID CHLORIDE THIS PROCESS MUST BE VERY LIABLE TO ERROR I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO FORM THE PER CHLORIDE EVEN FROM CHLORINE SLOWLY PASSED THROUGH MURIATE OF LIME WITHOUT PRODUCING A SMALL QUANTITY OF LIQUID HYDRATE OF PERCHLORIDE WHICH WHEN THE SOLID PERCHLORIDE WAS CON VERTED INTO LIQUID BY MORE PHOSPHORUS ROSE IN VAPOUR WITH IT AND WHICH CONTAINING NEARLY A DOUBLE QUANTITY OF CHLORINE FOR THE WATER FORMS A VERY SMALL PART OF IT OCCASIONS THE PRECIPITATION OF A MUCH LARGER QUANTITY OF HORN SILVER THAN THE PURE CHLORIDE FORMED FROM CORROSIVE SUBLIMATE THESE VARIOUS EXPERIMENTS ON THE COMBINATION OF PHOS PHORUS WITH OXYGEN AND CHLORINE SUFFICIENTLY AGREE WITH EACH OTHER TO AFFORD THE MEANS OF DETERMINING THE PROPORTION IN WHICH PHOSPHORUS COMBINES WITH OTHER BODIES OR ITS EQUIVA LENT NUMBER CONSIDERED AS AN ELEMENT IF THE ABSORPTION OF OXYGEN BE CONSIDERED AS OFFERING THE DATA AND PHOSPHORIC ACID BE SUPPOSED TO CONSIST OF TWO PRO PORTIONS OF OXYGEN AND ONE OF PHOSPHORUS THE NUMBER REPRESENTING THE PROPORTION IN WHICH PHOSPHORUS COMBINES WILL BE 223 IF PHOSPHORIC ACID BE CONSIDERED AS CONSISTING OF FOUR PROPORTIONS OF OXYGEN THE PROPORTIONAL NUMBER OR EQUIVALENT OF PHOSPHORUS WILL BE 446 IF THE ABSORPTION OF CHLORINE IN FORMING PHOSPHORANE BE MADE THE DATUM THE NUMBER WILL BE THE SAME 299 OR THE DOUBLE 444 IF THE QUANTITY OF HORN SILVER FORMED FROM THE LIQUID CHLORIDE TAKING THE MEAN OF ALL THE EXPERIMENTS BE ASSUMED AS THE DATUM THE NUMBER WOULD BE 235 OR THE DOUBLE 47 THE MEAN OF ALL THESE PROPORTIONS IS 26 OR THE DOUBLE 45G OR TAKING AWAY DECIMALS 45 IN REFERRING TO THE ANALYSES WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE OF THEOF THE COMBINATIONS OF PHOSPHORUS DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF PHOSPHORIC ACID FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASCERTAINING IF THEY CORRESPOND WITH THIS NUMBER I FOUND THE DATA SO UNCERTAIN AND SO DISCORDANT THAT IT WAS IMPOSSI BLE TO FORM ANY CONCLUSIONS FROM THEM THE PHOSPHATE OF SODA AS IS WELL KNOWN HAS ALKALINE PROPERTIES YET ACCORD ING TO M BERZELIUS IT CONTAINS BUT 1767 OF SODA TO 0O33 OF ACID WHEREAS IT OUGHT TO CONTAIN ACCORDING TO THE PROPOR TION INDICATED BY MY EXPERIMENTS IF NEUTRAL NEARLY AN EQUAL WEIGHT OF SODA M BERZELIUS MENTIONS SEVERAL COM BINATIONS OF BARYTA AND LIME WITH PHOSPHORIC ACID OF WHICH ONLY TWO APPROACH TO A CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE NUMBER I HAVE GIVEN FOR PHOSPHORUS THAT CONTAINING 455 OF ACID TO 487 OF LIME AND THAT CONTAINING 391 OF ACID TO 608 OF BARYTES NEW RESEARCHES ARE REQUIRED TO EXPLAIN THE ANO MALIES PRESENTED BY THE PHOSPHATES I SHALL GIVE THREE EXPERIMENTS ON THE QUANTITY OF HYDRATE OF POTASSA NECESSARY FOR SATURATING GIVEN QUANTITIES OF PHOS PHORIC ACID MADE FROM GIVEN WEIGHTS OF PHOSPHORUS 18 GRAINS OF PHOSPHORUS CONVERTED INTO PHOSPHORIC ACID BY COMBUSTION IN OXYGEN REQUIRED FOR ITS SATURATION 47 GRAINS OF DRY HYDRATE OF POTASSA 57 GRAINS OF PHOSPHORUS CONVERTED INTO ACID REQUIRED 147 OF HYDRATE OF POTASSA 5 GRAINS OF PHOSPHORUS CONVERTED INTO PERCHLORIDE DEMAND ED TO PRODUCE PERFECT NEUTRALIZATION 68 GRAINS OF HYDRATE OF POTASSA THESE THREE EXPERIMENTS AGREE SO WELL WITH EACH OTHER AND WITH THE PROPORTIONATE NUMBER GAINED FROM THE ABSORPTION OF CHLORINE AND OXYGEN BY PHOSPHORUS THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO PUT CONFIDENCE IN THEM 329SIR H DAVYS NEW EXPERIMENTS ON SOME IF 131 BE CONSIDERED AS THE QUANTITY OF HYDRATE OF POTASSA REQUIRED TO NEUTRALIZE THE PHOSPHORIC ACID FORMED IN THE LAST EXPERIMENT AND THE 549 OF HYDRATE REMAINING BE SUPPOSED TO CONTAIN 43 GRAINS OF POTASSA THEN THE CHLORINE REQUIRED TO EXPEL THE OXYGEN FROM THE POTASSA WOULD BE RATHER MORE THAN 40 CUBICAL INCHES WE OWE TO THE INGENUITY OF M DULONG THE DISCOVERY OF AN ACID WHICH HE NAMES THE HYPOPHOSPHOROUS ACID AND WHICH HE SUPPOSES TO CONTAIN HALF THE QUANTITY OF OXYGEN IN THE PHOS PHOROUS ACID I HAVE SATISFIED MYSELF AS TO THE CORRECTNESS OF HIS VIEWS RESPECTING THE EXISTENCE OF THIS ACID AND THE PRO PERTIES OF ITS COMPOUNDS BUT I CANNOT REGARD THE METHOD HE HAS ADOPTED FOR ITS ANALYSIS AS ENTITLED TO CONFIDENCE HE TAKES A GIVEN QUANTITY OF HYPOPHOSPHITE OF SODA ACTS UPON THIS BY CHLORINE CONVERTS THE EXCESS OF CHLORINE INTO MURIATIC ACID PRECIPITATES BY NITRATE OF SILVER AND EARTHY SALTS AND FROM THE COMPARISON OF ALL THESE DATA IN WHICH SOME SUBSTANCES OF UNCERTAIN COMPOSITION MAY BE CONCERNED DRAWS HIS CON CLUSIONS I HAVE FOUND THAT THE NEUTRAL HYPOPHOSPHITE OF BARYTES WHEN ACTED ON BY HEAT IN CLOSE VESSELS IS CONVERTED INTO ACID PHOSPHATE OF BARYTES DISENGAGING AN ELASTIC FLUID WHICH IS ALMOST ENTIRELY THE HYDROPHOSPHORIC GAS OR PHOSPHURETTED HYDROGEN SATURATED WITH PHOSPHORUS I SAY ALMOST ENTIRELY BECAUSE IN THE BEGINNING OF THE PROCESS A LITTLE GAS SPONTA NEOUSLY INFLAMMABLE IS PRODUCED AND A MINLUTE QUANTITY OF MOISTURE APPEARS AND WHEN THE HEAT IS RAISED TO REDNESS A VERY LITTLE PHOSPHORUS IS PRCD ICED PROBABLY FROM THE DECOM POSITION OF A PART OF THE PHOSPHORIC GAS NOW SUPPOSING THE QUANTITY OF PHOSPHORIC ACID IN PHOSPHATE OF BARYTA KNOWN 330OF THE COMBINATIONS OFPHOSPHORUS AND THE QUANTITY OF PHOSPHORUS IN PHOSPLURETTED HYDROGEN KNOWN IT IS VERY EASY FROM AN ACCURATE EXPERIMENT ON THE DECOMPOSITION OF THE HYPOPHOSPHITE OF BARYTA TO LEARN THE COMPOSITION OF HYPOPHOSPHOROUS ACID I MADE TWO EXPERIMENTS ON THIS SUBJECT IN ONE 5O GRAINS OF DRY HYPOPHOSPHITE OF BARYTES WERE USED AND THE DISTILLA TION CONDUCTED IN A SMALL GLASS TUBE ABOUT 395 CUBICAL INCHES OF GAS WERE PRODUCED THE LOSS OF WEIGHT OF THE APPARATUS COULD NOT BE ASCERTAINED AS UNLUCKILY A LITTLE OF THE PHOSPHATE WAS LOST A SMALL PORTION OF PHOSPHORUS WAS DE POSITED IN THE UPPER PART OF THE TUBE FROM THE DECOMPOSITION OF A MINUTE QUANTITY OF THE BIPHOSPHURETTED GAS BUT THIS COULD NOT HAVE EQUALLED THE  OF A GRAIN AS THE TUBE ONLY LOST 4 BY BEING HEATED TO WHITENESS IN THE SECOND EXPERIMENT 29 GRAINS OF THE HYPOPHOSPHITE WERE USED AND THE LOSS OF WEIGHT ONLY ASCERTAINED WHICH WAS 35 GRAINS TO BE ABLE TO FORM ANY OPINION AS TO THE COMPOSITION OF THE HYPOPHOSPHOROUS ACID IT WAS NECESSARY TO ASCERTAIN THE COMPOSITION OF THE PHOSPHATE OF BARYTA PRO DUCED IN THESE EXPERIMENTS WHICH WAS EASILY DONE BY PRECIPITATING A GIVEN QUANTITY OF THE HYPOPHOSPHITE OF BARYTES BY SULPHATE OF SODA IN SOLUTION 15 GRAINS OF HYPO PHOSPHITE OF BARYTES IN AN EXPERIMENT VERY CAREFULLY MADE AFFORDED 113 OF SULPHATE OF BARYTES NOW SUPPOSING THIS SULPHATE OF BARYTES TO CONTAIN 74 OF BARYTA THE HYPOPHOSPHITE WOULD CONSIST OF 74 OF BARYTA AND 76 OF HYPOPHOSPHOROUS ACID AND IIL OF THE ACID PHOSPHATE OF BARYTA FORMED FROM ITS DECOMPOSITION WOULD CONTAIN 57 PHOSPHORIC ACID AND 74 BARYTA AND IN THE EXPERIMENT IN WHICH G9 GRAINS OF HYPO PHOSPHITE OF BARYTA WERE DECOMPOSED SUPPOSING THE WHOLE MDCCCXVIII X X 831SIR H DAVYS NEW EXPERIMENTS ON SOME LOSS OF WEIGHT TO BE OWING TO PERPHOSPHURETTED HYDROGEN GIVEN OFF AND THIS GAS TO BE COMPOSED OF 225 OF PHOSPHORUS TO 4 OF HYDROGEN OR OF 529 HYDROGEN TO 2976 PHOSPHORUS AND THE 255 OF ACID PHOSPHATE REMAINING COMPOSED OF 1447 BARYTA NEARLY AND 11O3 PHOSPHORIC ACID ADDING THE 2976 OF PHOSPHORUS TO THE 479 IN THE PHOSPHORIC ACID AND SUBTRACTING 89 THE QUANTITY OF OXYGEN REQUIRED TO FORM WATER WITH THE 504 OF HYDROGEN THE HYPOPHOSPHOROUS ACID MAYBE CONCEIVED TO BE COMPOSED OF 769 PHOSPHORUS AND 254 WHICH DENOTES RATHER LESS THAN HALF THE OXYGEN IN PHOSPHOROUS ACID I E AS 743 TO 15 AN APPROXIMATION NEARER THAN COULD HAVE BEEN EXPECTED ASSUMING THE COMPOSITION OF THE PHOSPHURETTED GAS TO BE WHAT IS STATED IN THE PRECEDING PAGE WHICH AGREES VERY NEARLY WITH AN EXPERIMENT WHICH I FORMERLY MADE THE FIRST EXPERIMENT ON THE QUANTITY OF GAS DISENGAGED WOULD GIVE A PROPORTION OF OXYGEN RATHER LESS THAN THAT WHICH HAS BEEN JUST CALCULATED UPON BUT IT MUST BE REMEMBEREDTHAT A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF COMMON PHOSPHURETTED HYDROGEN IS PRODUCED WHICH CONTAINING LESS HYDROGEN IN A GIVEN VOLUME WOULD SUFFICIENTLY EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE OF RESULT M DULONG HAS ADVANCED AN INGENIOUS OPINION THAT THE HYPOPHOSPHOROUS ACID MAY BE CONSIDERED AS A TRIPLE COMPOUND OF HYDROGEN OXYGEN AND PHOSPHORUS THERE IS ANOTHER VIEW WHICH MAYBE TAKEN OF ITS COMPOSITION NAMELY THAT IT MAY BE A COMPOUNDOF PHOSPHORIC ACID AND PERPHOSPHURETTED HYDROGEN PHOSPHURETTED HYDROGEN AS MAY BE DEDUCED FROM SOME EX PERIMENTS OF M DULONG HAS THE PROPERTIES OF A VERY WEAK ALKALI AND WHEN EXPELLED FROM THE NEUTRAL HYPOPHOSPHITES THEY BECOME ACID THIS VIEW AGREES VERY WELL WITH THE EQUI 332OF THE COMBINATIONS OF PHOSPHORUS VALENT OR PROPORTIONAL NUMBERS WHICH REPRESENT PHOSPHORIC ACID AND PHOSPHURETTED HYDROGEN IF IT BE ADOPTED THE HYPO PHOSPHITES MUST BE CONSIDERED AS TRIPLE COMPOUNDS ANALOGOUS TO THE SALTS CONTAINING FIXED ALKALI AND EARTHS OR AMMONIA AND EARTHS COMBINED WITH ACIDS M DULONG IMAGINES THAT THE ACID FORMED BY THE SLOW COMBUSTION OF PHOSPHORUS IN THE AIR AND WHICH I HAVE SUPPOSED TO BE A MIXTURE OF PHOSPHORUS AND PHOSPHORIC ACIDS IS A PECULIAR ACID A CHEMICAL COMPOUND OF PHOSPHOROUS AND PHOSPHORIC ACIDS WHICH HE NAMES PHOSPHATIC ACID I CANNOT SAY THAT HIS ARGUMENTS GIVE MUCH PROBABILITY TO THIS OPINION THIS SUBSTANCE HAS NO CRYSTALLINE FORM NO MARKED CHARACTER WHICH DISTINGUISHES IT FROM A MERE MIXTURE OF PHOSPHOROUS AND PHOSPHORIC ACIDS AND AS FAR AS MY EXPERIMENTS HAVE GONE IT IS FAR FROM UNIFORMIN ITS COMPOSITION AND PHOSPHOROUS AND PHOSPHORIC ACIDS MIXED TOGETHER PRODUCE A SUBSTANCE OF EXACTLY THE SAME KIND THAT A MIXTURE OF PHOSPHOROUS AND PHOSPHORIC ACIDS SHOULD BE PRODUCED BY THE SLOW COMBUSTION OF PHOSPHORUS IS NOT SURPRISING WHEN IT IS CONSIDERED THAT THIS PHENOMENON IS CONNECTED WITH DIFFERENT CHEMICAL PROCESSES VIZ THE ACTION OF THE VAPOUR OF PHOSPHORUS UPON AIR THE ACTION OF SOLID PHOS PHORUS UPON THE ELASTIC ATMOSPHERE AND UPON THE AIR DISSOLVED IN THE MOISTURE ATTRACTED BY THE ACIDS FORMED AND UNLESS VAPOUR BE PRESENT IN THE AIR THE PROCESS OF THE SLOW CONVER SION OF PHOSPHORUS INTO ACIDS SOON STOPS I HAVE MENTIONED IN THE PAPER TO WHICH I HAVE REFERRED IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS COMMUNICATION THAT THE HYDROPHOSPHO ROUS ACID IS DECOMPOSED BY HEAT  AND THAT PHOSPHORIC ACID AND PERPHOSPHURETTED HYDROGEN ARE THE RESULTS IN EXA MINING THE NATURE OF THE PHOSPHORIC ACID FORMED I FIND TLAT 283SIR H DAVYS NEW EXPERIMENTS ON SOME 3843 IT CONTAINS WATER SO THAT IT IS A HYDRATED PHOSPHORIC ACID IN CAREFULLY CONDUCTING THE EXPERIMENT I FIND LIKEWISE THAT A SMALL PROPORTION OF WATER IS GIVEN OFF WITH THE PERPHOSPHU RETTED GAS I SHALL GIVE THE RESULTS OF AN EXPERIMENT 175 GRAINS OF HYDROPHOSPHOROUS ACID WERE DECOMPOSED BY HEAT IN A SMALL GLASS RETORT CAREFULLY WEIGHED 65 CUBICAL INCHES OF ELASTIC FLUID WERE GENERATED AND THE LOSS OF THE RETORT WAS 4 GRAINS NOW IF IT BE ASSUMED THAT THE HYDRATE OF PHOSPHORIC ACID  REMAINING EQUALLED 185 GRAINS AND THAT IT CONTAINED ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF DEFINITE PROP ORTIONS 188 OF WATER AND THAT THE BIPHOSPHURETTED GAS WEIGHED 1937 AND CON SISTED OF I6446 PHOSPHORUS AND 9984 HYDROGEN THEN THE OXYGEN IN THE PHOSPHOROUS ACID WILL BE TO THE PHOSPHORUS AS 44 TO 66 WHICH IS AS NEAR A RESULT AS CAN BE EXPECTED FOR 4 PROPORTIONS OF PHOSPHOROUS ACID ARE   OO OR THE DOUBLE 15O AND O1 OF WATER  170 OR 85 WHICH TOGETHER AMOUNT TO  470 OR 935 WHICH FORM 3 PROPORTIONS OF PHOSPHORIC ACID 315 OR 1575 WITH 3 OF WATER TO FORM THE HYDRATE  51 OR 55 366 183O 4 OF WATER DECOMPOSED OF WHICH THE HYDRO GEN IS 8 TO FORM WITH 45 OF PHOSPHORUS PHOSPHURETTED HYDROGEN   5 OR 65 8 OF WATER GIVEN OFF   5 OR 255 MAKING 7  4 OR 235  I PROVED IT TO BE A HYDRATE BY HEATING IT WITH MAGNESIA WHEN ABUNDANCE OF WATER WAS GIVEN OFF FROM ITOF THE COMBINATIONS OF PHOSPHORUS I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE ACID WHICH I USED FORMERLY WAS DRIER THAN THE ACID EMPLOYED IN THIS EXPERIMENT WHICH WILL ACCOUNT FOR THE DIFFERENCE OF THE RESULT SUPPOSING A HYDRO PHOSPHOROUS ACID COULD BE PROCURED CONTAINING ONLY THE QUANTITY OF WATER SUFFICIENT TO CONVERT IT INTO DRY PHOSPHORIC ACID IT WOULD CONSIST AS I HAVE STATED IN MY FORMER PAPER ON PHOSPHORUS OF FOUR PROPORTIONS OF WATER AND FOUR PRO PORTIONS OF PHOSPHOROUS ACID I HAVE ADOPTED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE OF THESE CALCULATIONS THE SUPPOSITION THAT THE HYDROGEN IN WATER IS TO THE OXYGEN AS 2 TO 15 AND CONSEQUENTLY I HAVE TAKEN THE NUMBER REPRESENTING OXYGEN AS 15 WHICH IS EXTREMELY CONVENIENT AS THE MULTIPLES ARE SIMPLE 8O 45 60 C TAKING THE PROPORTION OF PHOSPHORIC ACID IN PHOSPHATE OF POTASSA WHICH MAY BE DEDUCED FROM THE EXPERIMENTS PAGE 29G IT APPEARS MORE CONVENIENT TO REPRESENT THE PROPORTIONAL NUMBER OR EQUIVALENT OF PHOSPHORUS BY 45 OR 45E THAN BY 225 OR 2E6 WHICH GIVES FACILITY IN ADOPTING EITHER HYPOTHESIS OF THE COMPOSITION OF HYPOPHOSPHOROUS ACID IF IT BE SUPPOSED A SIMPLE COMPOUND OF OXYGEN AND PHOSPHORUS THE SERIES OF PROPORTIONS IN THE ACIDS OF PHOSPHORUS WILL BE HYPOPHOSPHOROUS ACID PHOSPHORUS 45 OXYGEN 15 PHOSPHOROUS ACID  45 OXYGEN 30 PHOSPHORIC ACID   45 OXYGEN 6O OR HYPOPHOSPHOROUSL PHOSPHORIC ACID 2 PROPORTIONS I0O ACID S63  J PHOSPHURETTED HYDROGEN I PROP 53 I SHALL CONCLUDE THIS PAPER BY A FEW INCIDENTAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE COMPOUNDS OF PHOSPHORUS M DULONG STATES THAT NO PHOSPHOROUS ACID IS FORMED WHEN PHOSPHORUS IS BURNT IN EXCESS OF OXYGEN OR ATMOSPHERIC AIR 335SIR H DAVYS NEW EXPERIMENTS ON SOME AS HE SAYS I HAVE ASSERTED I CANNOT FIND THAT I HAVE ANY WHERE MADE SUCH AN ASSERTION BUT NOTWITHSTANDING WHAT M DULONG PRETENDS THE ASSERTION IS TRUE AS THE FOLIOW ING EXPERIMENT WILL PROVE HALF A GRAIN OF PHOSPHORUS WAS SET FIRE TO IN A RETORT CONTAINING 16 CUBICAL INCHES OF COMMON AIR THE ACID PRODUCTS WERE WASHED WITH DISTILLED WATER AND PASSED THROUGH A FILTER AND EVAPORATED WHEN THE ACID BECAME NEARLY DRY SMALL GLOBULES OF PHOSPHURETTED HYDROGEN WERE DISENGAGED FROM IT INDICATING THE PRESENCE OF PHOS PHOROUS ACID THE EXPERIMENT WAS REPEATED TWO OR THREE TIMES CARE BEING TAKEN TO SEPARATE THE RED POWDER WHICH HAS BEEN CONSIDERED AS AN OXIDE OF PHOSPHORUS AND ALWAYS WITH THE SAME RESULT WHENEVER PHOSPHORUS IS INFLAMED AND SUFFERED TO BECOME EXTINGUISHED IN OXYGEN GAS IN EXCESS UNLESS THE PRODUCT IS STRONGLY HEATED AFTER THE SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION IS OVER AN ACID OF WHICH THE HYDRATE PRODUCES PHOSPHURETTED HYDROGEN BY HEAT IS ALWAYS FOUND IN THE PRODUCTS AND THIS ACID IS PROBABLY PRODUCED BY THE ACTION OF THE SOLID PHOSPHORUS ON THE PHOSPHORIC ACID IN CONTACT WITH IT THIS FACT AND THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT MUCH PHOSPHORUS ACID IS PRODUCED BY THE COMBUSTION OF PHOSPHORUS IN RARE AIR RENDERS IT ALMOST CER TAIN THAT THE PHOSPHOROUS ACID IS A DIRECT COMBINATION OF PHOSPHORUS AND OXYGEN AND DESTROYS AN IDEA WHICH MIGHT OTHERWISE BE FORMED FROM THE PHENOMENA OF THE DECOMPO SITION OF ITS HYDRATE NAMELY THAT IT IS A COMPOUND OF THREE PROPORTIONS OF PHOSPHORIC ACID AND ONE OF PHOSPHURETTED HYDROGEN M DULONG AND M BERZELIUS SPEAK OF FREEING PHOSPHO YANE OR THE LIQUID CHLORIDE OF PHOSPHORUS FROM PHOSPHORUS 336      I                1  1    I  I  I IOF THE COMBINATIONS OF PHOSPHORUS BY DISTILLATION IN EXPERIMENTS MADE IN THE LABORATORY OF THE ROYAL INSTITUTION IN WHICH IT HAS BEEN TWICE CAREFULLY DISTILLED AT A LOW HEAT IT HAS STILL CONTAINED MINUTE QUANTITIES OF PHOSPHORUS IT HAS BEEN SUPPOSED THAT DRY PHOSPHORIC ACID IS FIXED AT A WHITE HEAT BUT I FIND THAT THIS IS NOT THE CASE IT RAPIDLY RISES IN VAPOUR AT THIS TEMPERATURE AND EVAPORATES EVEN AT THE POINT OF FUSION OF FLINT GLASS AND THE HYDRATE OF PHOS PHORIC ACID IS SUSCEPTIBLE OF BEING VOLATILIZED AT A MUCH LOWER TEMPERATURE IN CONVERTING THE SOLID SUBLIMATE COMPOSED OF PHOSPHORUS AND CHLORINE INTO THE LIQUID COMPOUND WHEN THE PHOSPHORUS IS FIRST FUSED IN CONTACT WITH THE SUBLIMATE A YELLOW CRYSTAL LINE MASS IS FORMED WHICH WHEN ACTED ON BY A HIGHER DEGREE OF HEAT AFFORDS THE LIQUID CHLORIDE WHICH RISES FROM IT IN VAPOUR AND LEAVES PHOSPHORUS BEHIND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THIS YELLOW SOLID IS A COMPOUND OF PHOSPHORUS AND CHLORINE CONTAINING HALF AS MUCH CHLORINE AS THE LIQUID SHOULD THIS BE PROVED TO BE THE CASE BY FUTURE EXPERIMENTS IT WILL GIVE WEIGHT TO THE IDEA THAT THE HYPOPHOSPHOROUS ACID IS A BINARY COMPOUND OF OXYGEN AND PHOSPHORUS 837

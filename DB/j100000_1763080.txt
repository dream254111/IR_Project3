COUNTRY SCHOOLS  IF the question proposed for this symposium is t3 be taken literally I should answer none Industry as such has in my judgment no place in the public schools though industriousness is always in order there The prime object of our school system is education and it cannot be to any considerable extent diverted from that end without injury to the schools themselves and to the community at large Indeed it would scarcely be possible to do a greater wrong to the major part of our publicschool children than by taking any ap preciable share of the little time they have for the development and training of their intellectual powers for the purpose of applying it to the mere means of breadwinning or moneymaking But while I thus hold strongly to the strictly educational character of schoolwork I believe that the courses of study in the schools of New England have been and though in a diminishing degree still are incomplete and inadequate to the demands of a full and symmetrical education I believe that these deficiencies have induced a one sided development of mind and character have led to the settingup of false standards of what is admirable and desirable in life have caused to be magnified glibness of speech force of declama tion readiness in recitation and retentiveness of memory at the expense of far more useful facul ties qualities or habits namely soundness of judg ment clearness of perception the habit of observa tion the creative instinct the executive faculty Briefly speaking my project of reform in schools for boys would be as follows carry the best approved methods of the kindergarten up ward through the primary grades as far as the means and resources of each school for itself will allow introduce more and more the study of form color texture structure and organization by means of natural objects in the hands of pupils and teachers stimulating and encouraging the pupils more and more as their faculties are developed to make observations for themselves at their play or at their work and to bring the results back to the schoolroom for comparison for criticism for discussion at the age of twelve or thereabouts introduce semi  weekly exercises with tools preferably wood  working tools and in claymodelling for the cultivation of the sense of form for the training of the eye and hand and for gaining the power to give material shape to conceptions of the mind at fourteen years of age or thereabouts introduce exercises in metalworking and require every boy who passes through 4one of the high schools of the state to become a good mechanic not at all for the sake of his practising a mechanical avocation but to make him a betterequipped more capable and more useful man All this could not be done at once The system would have to be introduced gradually and ten tatively Probably the more natural order would be that the system should extend from the higher schools downward and from the city schools out ward Much would be learned in the course of the gradual development of such a system and the best conceived programme would doubtless require considerable modifications as the result of experience In the case of girls somewhat different exer cises should be prescribed They should of course share in the extension of kindergarten methods and objective scienceteaching Of all other exercises sewing and cooking should have preference Claymodelling and paper and paste board cutting might advantageously replace much of the woodworking required of boys but it is not at all certain that girls may not advantageous ly be taught simple carpentry and cabinetwork The lastnamed exercises have been introduced with great success into the normal schools at Salem and Bridgewater Mass where the young women readily acquire the power of making much of the simple apparatus required for teaching ele mentary physics and mechanics FRANCIS A WALKER It is doubtful if any industrial feature can be profitably introduced into country schools at the present time 1 Industrial education is very costly Under the apprenticeship system seven of the best years of the life of the youth were given in exchange for the skill that might be imparted by the master workman in a single trade Still the training of the apprentice was very unscientific Competent and experienced teachers declare that two weeks of systematic instruction in a thoroughly equipped i366 SCIENCE wellconducted manualtraining school produces as great a degree of dexterity as two years ap prenticeship under the adverse conditions which prevail in the typical tradeshop The institu tion that affords such scientific instruction is necessarily expensive The Chicago manualtrain ing school received an endowment fund of one hundred thousand dollars but the tuitionfee therein is two hundred and forty dollars for the course of three years and yet the institution is not selfsustaining 2 The necessity for industrial features is far less imperative in country than in city schools The country boy learns very early in life to do a host of things by doing them He almost invari ably finds his way to a shop containing the typi cal handtools and learns to use them and through such use his eyes his hands and his mind are trained Ruskin expresses this idea in a terse sentence Let the youth once learn to take a straight shaving off a plank or draw a fine curve without faltering or lay a brick level in its mortar and he has learned a multitude of other matters which no lips of man could ever teach him Every exercise of farmwork in which the youth engages develops the observation and ren ders the judgment more accurate A rainy day in the shop with the saw the hammer the plane the chisel and the square is better than a week of the city boys school The experience of the country boy in field forest and shop is the most important factor in his education It is to these industrial features of his training that he owes his undoubted superiority to the city youth Too much prominence cannot be given the fact that it is in the country that the race is regenerated Rousseaus remark Cities are the graves that swallow up the human species is worthy the careful consideration of educationists The founding of manualtraining schools in cities is an effort to give to city children that knowledge of things which is obtained by country children out of school It is hence impracticable for the time being because of its great cost to add industrial train ing to the curriculum of the country schools and it is unnecessary to do so since a thousand things are learned for nothing by the country boy through the daily exercises of labor and play which can be mastered by the city youth only in special schools established and conducted at large cost CHARLES H HAM The meaning and application of the term  school education is broadening year by year not in the sense of increasing the number of the subjects of VOL IX No 219 knowledge for the young people to study but in discriminating with a view to lessening them thereby providing the means for a better more natural growth of the mental and physical powers The limit of this abuse of the privileges of school by compelling an excessive use of the brain we believe is reached  and the best teachers all over the state and country are seeking earnestly for a remedy Just now attention is being largely turned toward industrial or manual training and notwithstanding one of the leading papers in the country says editorially Industrial education should be kept out of the ordinary common school these cannot have any further branches there is wisdom in the movement Let us see One great object in introducing manual training into the schools is to reduce the number of the subjects of daily study of a purely intellectual character Some of these are known to be of doubtful utility Drop them out and give them occupation just what they need and this is abundantly supplied by a systematic course in manual training Before the child has entered school at all it has learned to use to the best advantage the eyes in seeing the ears in hearing and the hands in ma nipulating Vast stores of knowledge have been acquired But once in the schoolroom and these sources of education are cut off What is to be gained thereafter in knowledge and wisdom must be obtained from a book Right here manual training steps in and by means of it if properly conducted the little one again sees things hears things and handles things The child is again restored to the outside world and to happiness Labor is apt to be considered disreputable to work with the hands is looked upon as humiliating People entertaining these ideas will sometimes resort to follies and crimes rather than be classed with those who thrive by manual toil Here again a judicious course in manual training steps in and clothes the young person with the honors of usefulness and recognition Elegant leisure idleness and all the resultant follies are not found in his vocabulary As a rule young children do not easily become interested in the study of books They have small powers to understand and weak memories to retain what they with difficulty comprehend and for which they have but little or no use Hence if they get on with their studies it must be done by cramming and learning by rote In dustrial or manual training opens a way to inter est them to develop and employ their perceptive faculties and to make the otherwise unattractive experiences of schoollife cheerful and pleasant A

people must have a large increasing force of strong active intelligent working men and wo men This force of men and women must be educated and trained in the right way from early childhood Their number has been diminishing of late Manual training in the schools all over the land will turn the tide and have a tendency to restore the country more nearly to a normal condition Now is industrial or manual training good for any child or youth  We think so and for all the children and youth in the land  for those in the country as well as for those in the city for the poor as well as the betterconditioned in short for all classes and all ages who are engaged in the duties of school So I think we may be assured that some industry or manual art can be and should be introduced into every country school whether the cottage by the roadside or the more pretentious structure for the hamlet or even the finely constructed institution for the village What industry can be profitably introduced Why any and every industry within the means of the school and suited to the capacity attainments and age cf the pupils in attendance There are many things that can be done with profit in any and all schools and as soon as the pupil enters upon schoollife one of them should be taken up and each carried forward one after the other just as the subjects of study are taken up and com

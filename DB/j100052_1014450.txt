of Pennsylvania Before the movement for mothers pension legislation spread over the United States after 1911 there were two general forms of administering relief to fatherless families The first was through private agencies many of which have for more than a decade realized that the only constructive solution of the poverty problem presented by the fatherless family is a regular allowance on which the widow can depend to free her from worry and overwork and enable her to give her children real home care The other form of admin istering aid was through the public agency for outdoor relief Under the old Poor Laws meager allowances had always been granted to widows but never on any adequate basis nor had the public offi cials administering this relief formulated any policies as to standards of family life to be required in the families aided nor defined the quality of service to the children that could reasonably be demanded from the mother While a few states have developed their mothers pensions system simply through an extension and reinterpretation of the old outdoor relief laws the general form of the new public adminis tration of relief has been through the courts This seemingly chance development was probably due to the fact that in a number of states the courts still have jurisdiction over dependent children and that one of the bestknown Juvenile Court judges in the coun try was the first to make an effort to have the jurisdiction of this court extended over such dependent families Then too there was the greatest distrust and dissatisfaction with the old outdoor relief agencies among those interested in public welfare and it seemed to be the easiest solution to divorce them entirely from the new adminis tration of this form of aid The states that have recently passed mothers pension legislation however have realized how unsatis factory administration of relief through the court is apt to be and recent mothers pension lawsnotably those of New York Pennsylvania Delaware and New Jerseyhave created an en 79THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY tirely new piece of administrative machinery based on the plan of county organization but with state supervision or control These efforts to separate this group of dependent families for special treat ment reveal a new realization that the community as a whole is largely to blame for the ills that afflict individuals and a growing conviction that from the point of view of selfinterest alone the state must assume greater responsibility for the welfare of its children In 1909 the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws of England recommended unanimously that the old poor law machin ery be abandoned and a new public assistance authority be created This year 1918 in the midst of Englands most costly war this plan has been actually carried out and the new plan comprehends all forms of relief and special provision for dependents and de fectives Our new Mothers Assistance legislation haphazard and un standardized though these efforts to meet the needs of fatherless families through public action have seemed has nevertheless these significant effects definite opportunity is offered to the state to discover the causes of the untimely deaths of the fathers at the very time of their greatest usefulness to society industry and the fam ily also the chance is given to estimate the cost to the state of preventable deaths of the breadwinner and the loss entailed by the subsequent dependency of the helpless family2 With these facts as a basis for further action mothers pension legislation should soon be taken over as an integral part of the larger and more constructive plan for social insurance3 Yet even under such a system of state organization a certain number of young fathers will continue to die untimely deaths leaving their families unprotected by any form of insurance and in need of organized assistance When the average individual hears the term widow if he does not think of the fictitious person named to obstruct any economic reform there instantly flashes into his mind a type picture of the poor widow of sentimentalism a frail hardworking devoted Bruno Lasker The Death

FATHERLESS FAMILY mother bending over a washtub and surrounded by a large group of hungry children While there are no more innocent and pitiful sufferers from our unorganized social system than the widow and orphan social workers know that there are as many kinds of widows as there are kinds of women At one end of the line is the capable mother who will make any sacrifice to keep her children with her and rear them in decency and comfort at the other the weak or vicious woman who will exploit neglect or abandon her children on the slightest pretext For the purposes of this paper the family with adequate finan cial resources is not considered nor is the one where deterioration in the values of family life whether due to environmental causes or individual defect has compelled the breaking up of the family to save the individuals that compose it The following discussion is limited to those fatherless families where with adequate income the children bid fair to become normal useful citizens under their mothers care Whether relief to a fatherless family is administered through a public or a private medium there are certain prerequisites of as sistance which all agencies endeavoring to follow modern methods of social service have established Investigation should not stop as all too frequently in the pastwith the proof of the fact and degree of need of the family A full consideration of the financial resources available in the way of help from relatives property or money owned by the widow her own or her childrens ability to contribute without harm to the support of the family is of course essential But the value of the family life measured through a con sideration of the mothers mental moral and physical fitness to bring up her children must also be determined by investigation Assistance should not be given in families where the mother is mentally unsound or defective morally weak or physically unable to give the children decent home care Finally investigation should show the basis of a plan for the future welfare of the family After the decision to grant assistance is made the social case treat ment of the family should be organized about this plan In any family the elements of normal life are disrupted by the death of the breadwinner His loss is more than the loss of a pay envelope At this stage of the social and economic development of woman the removal of the father of the family is apt to have a 7 81THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY very serious effect upon the familys solidarity His loss is felt in the makingof plans for the spending of the income effectively as well as in the loss of the income itself There is great need of his discipline and advice in the training of the children especially in the case of growing boys In certain foreign groups particularly where the status of woman is regarded as so much lower than that of man it seems almost impossible for a mother no matter how de voted and earnest to control and guide her restless adolescent son Often too the father has been the one to attend to such business details as the payment of rent and insurance dues the one to ar range for necessary medical care for the children The father also gives the family a certain social and economic status in the com munity through his relation to labor organizations employers and politicians His advice at the time the children begin to enter in dustry and to choose occupations for themselves is usually sorely needed To supply all these weaknesses in the family life is the task of the social worker who administers relief to the family and supervises their welfare In many ways the fatherless family offers the ideal group for a demonstration of the value of social case treatment provided that the assistance given is adequately and wisely planned The Home Service of the Red Cross bases its strong claim to serve the families of soldiers and sailors on similar grounds4 A growing family of normal children offers every opportunity for constructive study and guidance The mother is free from the strain of child bearing and as the children grow older can give more attention to the development of family life The fact that the income is adequate and steady and not open to fluctuations due to unemployment illness of the bread winner or personal weaknesses on his part such as drunkenness and brutality enables the mother to gain habits of foresight and thrift that she has perhaps never been able to develop before A study of the social records of families adequately assisted and well super vised shows that in many cases a rise in the standard of living of the family has actually been achieved Certainly there can be no more satisfying result in social case treatment than the graduation of a widows family into complete independence with fuller social con tacts good educational grounding and a wellrounded family life After investigation has established the fact and degree of need 4 A R C 201  Manual of Home Service Second edition pp 1346 82THE FATHERLESS FAMILY of the family discovered all available and legitimate resources to meet that need and found that the mother is mentally morally and physically fit to perform her normal duties to her children the first step in the plan for future supervision is the consideration of a sound financial basis on which the family should be maintained Unfortunately it is still true that most fatherless families do not come to the attention of any social agencies public or private until some time after the death of the man This period is almost sure to be one of family deterioration The strain of the fathers illness and death the pressing need of the necessities of life the demands on the mothers time and strength from her effort to support the family and maintain the home all tend to involve her in difficulties that she could not surmount alone Through the widows short sightedness or total ignorance of the world of business the insurance money slips in a few weeks through her fingers Dozens of instances can be described by social workers where a designing friend of the husband has taken advantage of the widows ignorance to ap propriate the larger part of the small lump of insurance or where wellmeaning neighbors or friends have given her just the kind of advice most certain to deplete her little fund The usual bad in vestment of this sort is either the buying of a home under a heavy mortgage in a congested or neglected neighborhood chosen with no consideration of sanitation neighborhood conditions or nearness to work and school or the expenditure of the few hundred dollars for stock for a little store In hundreds of such instances the stock has soon been sold there is of course no capital to replenish it and finally the little store closes and the familys small reserve fund vanishes with it It is surprising to social workers to find how frequently women have not been allowed by their husbands to handle money even for the household needs Obviously it takes a certain amount of fore sight to save ahead for the rent and insurance and even more to realize that furniture or other household necessities bought on the installment plan are not a good investment Before working out a budget of living expenses for the family the case worker usually must spend some days in discovering what the familys liabilities are and in straightening out a tangle of unpaid bills lapsed in surance policies and installment charges After the existing economic resources of the family are dis 83THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY covered the next consideration involves deciding which of these are legitimate assets that can be counted on for the future and which part of the income should be cut off or decreased for the well being of the family In many states the law determines the max imum amount of property and money a widow may have and still be eligible for assistance There is some difference of opinion and legal provision on this question varying for example from the law in Illinois where a mother is disqualified for assistance if she possesses any property and money to California where a maximum of five hundred dollars in cash and a thousand dollars in property is allowed The consensus of opinion seems to be that some equity in property provided it is the widows own home tends to add to the selfrespect and thrift of the family and to keep them in the neigh borhood and town where they have become established and where all their natural social contacts have been made The sacrifice of a home to most people brings great discouragement and the feeling of loss of social standing Then too many instances prove that it would have been actually cheaper to assist a mother who owns her home provided the home was suitable to the familys needs and not deteriorating in value than to insist that she sacrifice it at a forced sale only to become a heavier charge on the community later In the matter of money in the bank since for the sake of econ omy in the distribution of available funds the amount of the monthly grant must be based on a necessity standard of living a little surplus is invaluable for meeting emergencies of sickness and accident that constantly arise in a family of young children This small reserve sum however should never be regarded as a source of income to be drained gradually through an inadequate grant and the under standing with the mother should be that it is only for emergency needs Yet there is no doubt that its possession adds to her feeling of independence and security from want In considering the question of relatives as a source of income the tendency seems to be for public agencies to take a different attitude from that held by private societies If relief is given by a public agency the attitude of the community usually is that a widows rela tives like other citizens of the state are contributing to her need through taxes and except where the law holds them legally respon sible for her support that they have a right to claim exemption from that responsibility There are of course many cases in which rela 84THE FATHERLESS FAMILY tives not responsible under the law have willingly shared with a public agency a part of the economic burden of the family The insistence of private agencies on the fullest possible aid from rela tives is founded on the belief that only through the enforced sense of mutual responsibility can family solidarity be maintained and that loyalty to ones own kin is a human value which must not be allowed to go to waste Whether such human values are actu ally enhanced by insistence on financial help from relatives already struggling to make ends meet is open to question5 There is no question however that the financial and social status of the rela tives should be determined and their help particularly in other than financial ways enlisted for the family One of the first methods of increasing income to which the needy widow turns is the keeping of men lodgers Through bitter experi ence over many years and with a large number of families social workers are unqualified in their disapproval of this method of adding to the income Aside from the fact that the presence of any stranger has a disrupting effect upon the family life there are many general considerations that render the policy a bad one The effect of the mens influence on the growing boys is often bad the difficulty of making decent sleeping arrangements in a small house and the act ual danger of physical violence to the woman or the little girls in the family must be considered Quite often companionship and pro pinquity lead to intimacy and illegitimate children make the fam ily problems more difficult Even close supervision cannot ward off these dangers In the case record of a family which has been under the supervision of one of the best private agencies in the country since 1911 we find the following significant entries 10211 Widow a particularly sweet appealing person Children clever and most attractive On account of high type of woman it seemed safe to allow her to keep her three boarders They are a good class of men interested in the children and helpful with them When the children need treatment Nick one of the boarders takes them to the hospital 102013 State Dispensary

in the record this family shows a slow but steady deterioration If a firm stand on the lodger ques tion had been taken in the beginning immediately after the hus bands death it is possible that the breakdown might not have occurred Another usual source of income for the family and one to be considered most carefully is the mothers own earnings In judg ing whether or not a mother receiving assistance should contribute to the familys support exactly the same considerations should hold that govern any mothers decision about work outside the home That is the question of whether she should add at all to the family income and to what extent should be decided by a study of the age and number of the children the condition of the mothers health the provision of care for the children during her absence and also her own inclination capacity and past habits No intelligent plan about the mothers work can be made unless the amount which she adds to the family budget be regarded as of secondary importance to these other determining questions Study of the industrial conditions of working mothers has shown that the large majority are employed in unskilled un standardized work at the lowest wages and for the longest hours 6 Office cleaning seems to be the work usually condemned by social workers for the mother of young children on the ground that itis extremely fatiguing and comes at just the time of day morning and evening when she is most needed by the children Of course a busy mother who works at night finds it very difficult to get the proper amount of sleep during the day and at the same time perform her household duties and give her children the proper care There is also a frequent temptation to the fatigued mother in going through the streets in the cold and dark to take a stimulant or make un desirable acquaintances The fact that even trained social work ers are sometimes strangely blind to the dangers involved in per mitting the mother to do this kind of work is shown in the following extracts from the case record of an assisted family Mother with 6 children ranging from 15 months to 9 years 6515 M working at K  B Dept store 4 hours every evening Receives 1 a day 6Katherine Anthony West Side Studies Mothers Who Must Earn R S F Survey Associates June 1914 p 153 86THE FATHERLESS FAMILY 11816 Visitor found a man sitting at the kitchen table in the evening Said he lodged in the same house and watched the children evenings while the mother worked 32916 Petition filed in Juvenile Court Children neglected Mother illegitimately pregnant While other factors than the mothers night work probably con tributed to the deterioration of this family it is clear from the entries in the record that it was the chief cause If it is necessary and de sirable that the mother supplement the income the consensus of opinion seems to be that sewing fine laundry or the care of other dependent children are more desirable than the usual forms of work because these occupations do not demand fixed hours of labor and can be carried on at home while she is attending to her familys needs The question of the contribution of working children to the family income is one that can be summarized briefly In order to increase the family income no child should be forced into work pre maturely or under conditions that jeopardize its health or future development It is equally true that a child should not be permit ted to contribute more than a reasonable amount of its wages to the support of the family and should not be made to feel that the family is dependent on its earnings to an undue degree After the family resources in property and money financial help from relatives and ways in which the mother and children may safely add to the family income are considered the question of the budget on which the family may be expected to maintain a good family standard must be decided There is no doubt that contin uous and adequate relief can be used as a lever to lift family stand ards of living and that it is not money aid in itself but the method of administering it that may do harm One of the arguments against public assistance is that it lacks the elasticity of private relief and cannot easily be adapted to the changing needs of the family But this is equally true of the weekly wage of the father and the average family must plan on a fixed sum The feeling of security which a fixed monthly or weekly allowance gives to a widow enables her to develop those qualities of foresight and thrift by which she may plan ahead for the winters coal or the next months rent So much scientific and detailed work has been done on budget planning for assisted families that it is unnecessary to describe it here 87THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY The one basic piinciple however is that the amount granted if ex pended with reasonable care must be adequate to ensure mainte nance of health working efficiency and a good standard of family life It is no exaggeration to say that there is hardly a family apply ing for assistance in which at least one member does not show signs of malnutrition or disease In the mothers the strain of child bearing overwork worry and enforced neglect of the simplest rules of hygiene have often resulted in chronic functional disorders or in conditions requiring surgical care varicose veins gynaecolog ical and digestive disorders flat feet and cardiac trouble are ailments common to these mothers Among the children disorders due to neglect and undernourishment are prevalent and there is great need for the medical treatment of skin diseases throat conditions anemia eye strain and other disorders that may result in serious retardation in school and later in industrial efficiency To meet these health needs the aid of private physicians hospitals conva lescent homes and sanatoriums must be enlisted In outlining a plan for supervision for a fatherless family it is well to decide what changes in the family life should be made at once Even if emergency aid only is given for a few days it is often wise to withhold regular assistance until a child who has been illegally employed is back in school the man lodger eliminated and in some cases until a member of the family in urgent need of medical care is actually under treatment When regular assistance begins the mothers hours of work should be changed at once to meet the plan for proper home care of the children Other changes such as the improvement in the school records of the children training the mother in budget keeping and securing dental care for the family may require months of regular visiting and patient effort In this attempt to ensure the progress and welfare of the fam ily it is perhaps unnecessary to say that the advice and help of clergymen school teachers former employers and relatives are needed Other social agencies can often render the special kind of service that is required to fit some particular need A housing as sociation may be consulted about a sanitary home in a good neigh borhood a visiting nurse called in if there is sickness in the family a vocational guidance bureau requested to advise the children as they approach working age the interest of a settlement or commun 88THE FATHERLESS FAMILY ity center enlisted to secure recreation and wider social contacts for the family The reading of a considerable number of records of assisted families in several cities that had been under the care of either a pub lic or private agency showed that there are still valuable opportuni ties in supervision that have hardly been touched In many cases the influence of the personality and ideals of the dead father is a vital factor in the family life yet only in isolated instances was there any reference to his plans and ambitions for his children While many records show an attempt to regulate the hours and working conditions of the mother there were practically no instances where she was offered the opportunity of training for more highly skilled and better paid work In view of the fact that she is usually quite young and will often be obliged to contribute to her childrens support for many years to come it would seem a wise economy to consider this pos sibility of increasing her earning power While the children are often put in the way of obtaining healthful pleasures and forming helpful friendships the same need in the life of the mother is not considered In one agency a special effort was made to encourage the mothers of assisted families to join mothers clubs attend night school and seek some social connection outside the home A study of one hundred records of this agency showed that at the time the grant was made eightyfive of the one hundred mothers were highly nervous and depressed After the families had been supervised and aided for a year only fifteen of the eightyfive had failed to be come cheerful and selfcontrolled Certainly this remarkable change must have been due to some extent to the social contacts the mothers had made Assistance and supervision of fatherless families under existing community organization can only be rendered successfully by trained social workers but in most communities there is not only no devel oped social consciousness but no one who knows the technique of social service It is clear that a full measure of state supervision and state aid is badly needed in all such communities A social reform measure introducing an intricate new mechanism but left to the isolated local community to administer is doomed to in efficiency Payment for adequate investigation and supervision in most communities must be made out of state funds and be under state control if the work is to be successful 89THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY It has been repeatedly pointed out that the only just way to solve the problem of the widow and orphan is to reduce their number by seeking to keep the wqgeearner alive The really preventive remedy here is social insurance The insurance principle makes premature deaths expensive and so tends to reduce their number The insurance method is also effective in making it possible for the wageearner to provide for his own wife and children in case of his death without leaving them to be cared for by any relief agency private or public The theory and even the practice of the mothers pension work are more closely identified with public relief than with the preven tive measure of insurance It provides state grants for dependent families on proof of destitution for the purpose of enforcing a measure of state guardianship over the health and education of its wards As has been shown emphasis is placed on moral considera tions as well as financial need Where it has been successfully ad ministered it represents a new and fine piece of public machinery made effective by its use of the approved methods of private agencies With the thoroughgoing social reform that is likely to follow the war and which is in fact already under way in England our antiquated poor laws will be done away with The unemployed the old the sick the invalid and the widow and orphan as well may soon be cared for democratically by social or contributory insur ance Yet even under such an advanced social organization there will still be a residuum of individuals and families requiring social case treatment It is to be hoped that out of Americas significant new experiment in public charitythe mothers assistance work may ultimately come a superior piece of public relief machinery re placing the old and discarded outdoor relief and embodying all the principles of case diagnosis and treatment that have been worked out so carefully by the private agencies in the past 90

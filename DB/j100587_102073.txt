J100587,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 16831775,102073,AN ACCOUNT OF A BOOK,I206879,668 CHRISTIANI HUGENII ASTROSCOPIA COMPENDIARIA TUBI OP TICI MOLIMINE LIBERATA OR THE DESCRIPTION OF AN AERIAL TELESCOPE THE USE OF TELESCOPES BEING SO NECESSARY FOR ASTRONOMY IT HATH BEEN THE ENDEAVOUR OF SEVERAL LOVERS OF THAT SCIENCE TO FIND OUT SOME MORE CONVENIENT AND EASIER WAY FOR THE HANDLING OF THE SAME THEN WHEREAS ALL THE PERFECTION THAT HITHERTO HATH BEEN ADDED TO TELESCOPES CHIEFLY CONSI STETH IN MAKING THEM VERY LONG AND THE GLASSES OF A BIG GER SPHERE THE SAME LENGTH AND BIGNESS THUS INCREASED HATH BEEN STIFLED BY A TROUBLESOME HEAVINESS AND DIS PROPORTION TO MANAGE AND DIRECT THEM TO THE STARS THE AUTHOR HENCE TO TAKE OFF THE INCUMBRANCE HATH FOUND OUT A DEVISE IN CUTTING OR LEAVING OUT ALMOST THE WHOLE TUBE SAVING ONLY A SMALL PART OF IT NEAR THE OBJECTIVE GLASS AND SOMEWHAT TOWARDS THE EYE GLASS ORDERING THESE TWO EXTREMITIES IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THEY MAY DO THE SAME SERVICE AS IF THE WHOLE TUBE OF ONE PIECE SHOULD BE IM PLOYED TO THIS PURPOSE HE EXPLAINETH HIMSELF BY A SCHEME AND CLEAR DESCRIPTION HOW A MAST MUST FIRST BE PERPEN DICULARLY FIXED INTO THE GROUND WHICH FOR HIS OWN USE HE TELLS WAS MADE OF 50 FOOT LONG SERVING FOR A TELESCOPE OF 70 FOOT THEN JOYNING TWO PARALLEL RULES ALL ALONG THIS MAST HE DECLARETH HOW BY THIS MEANS THE OBJECTIVE GLASS MAY BE EASILY DRAWN UP AND DOWNWARDS BY THE HELP OF A STRING OR CORD APPLIED TO AN EQUILIBRATED WEIGHT SO THAT IT BE CORRESPONDENT TO THE EYE GLASS THE CIRCUM STANCES WHEREOF CAN BE READ IN HIS PRINTED PAPER WHERE ALSO THE FULL STRUCTURE IS TO BE SEEN ONLY TO COME TO THE OBJECTION WHICH THE AUTHOR PROPOSES HIMSELF AGAINST THE USE OF THIS CURTAILED TELESCOPE THE FIRST IS THE FICKLE NESS IN KEEPING ALWAYES THE EYEGLASS IN THE SAME POSTURE TO REMEDY THIS HE DESCRIBETH A TWO LEGGED INSTRUMENT TO BE PUT UNDER THE 2 ARMS TO HOLD THEM UP THE MORE STEADILY SECONDLY IT SEEMETH TO BE A HARD MATTER TO FIND OUT AT NIGHT TIME IN SUCH A DISTANCE THE OBJECTIVE GLASS OR THE STARS YOU LOOK FOR THE CORD ALONE NOT BEING ABLE TO DIRECT THE WHOLE BUSINESS TO HELP THIS INCONVENIENCY HE SAITH ONE MUST MAKE USE OF A LANTERN WHICH BEING IN THE SAME MANNER AS COMMONLY USED FOR THE PROJECTI ON OF IMAGES AND DISPERSION OF LIGHT WILL GIVE DIRECTION FOR THE FINDING THE OBJECTIVE GLASS BY INLIGHTNING THE SAME FOR TO669 TO MAKE A DUE AGREEMENT WITH THAT OTHER GLASS BUT AS TO OBSERVE THE MOON THERE NEEDS NOTHING OF THIS WHEN THE GLASS EASILY MAY BE DISCOVERED BY THE MOON LIGHT IT SELF  IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND IN SUCH A LENGTH OF A TUBE OF 100 01 200 FOOT THE TRUE PARALLELISM OF THE TWO GLASSES THE STRING BEING BENDED IN THE MIDDLE AND ALSO NOT FIT TO GIVE A TRUE   DIRECTION TO THIS HE ANSWERETH 1 THAT THERE IS NO NEED OF SUCH A GEOMETRICAL PERFECTION OF PA RALLELISM BUT THAT THE SAME MAY HAVE SOME LATITUDE 2 THE STRING BEING OF A SMALL WEIGHT AND ONLY A SILK THRED WHICH 50 FOOT LONG DOTH SCARCE AMOUNT TO HALFE A DRACHM AND YET ABLE TO HOLD 7 OF WEIGHT THIS BENDING OF THE STRING WILL CAUSE ONLY A SMALL ERROUR FOR TO FIND HOW MUCH THE BENDING MAKETH IT DECLINE IF IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE A PARABOLICAL LINE IN THE CURVATURE THE ANGLE OF DE FLECTION BY THE TANGENT WILL COME TO 24 MINUTS WHICH IN 150 FOOT DISTANCE PRODUCETH AN ERROUR OF ONE FOOT THAT THE EYE WILL BE OUT OF HER TRUE WAY OF DIRECTION BUT TO REMEDY ALL THIS HE SHEWETH HOW BY THE HELP OF THE LANTERNE SUCH MISTAKES MAY BE CORRECTED FOURTHLY THE CONSTITUTION OF THE AIR AS BEING WINDIE OR TEMPESTU OUS WILL MAKE A GREAT HINDRANCE FOR THE STRING OR CORD WILL BE ALTERED AND DRAWN AT ONE OR THE OTHER SIDE TO PREVENT THIS THERE IS NO REMEDY THE COMMON SORT OF TELESCOPES BEING SUBJECT TO THE SAME TROUBLES YEA SOME TIMES WHEN THE AIR IS VERY QUIET AND THE SKY CLEAR YET THE STARS MUCH GLITTERING THE TELESCOPES WILL NOT SERVE AL SO THE VAPOURS SOMETIMES WILL STICK TO THE GLASS FIFTHLY AGAINST THE LANTERN BEFORE MENTIONED ONE MIGHT OBJECT THAT AT A DI STANCE OF 200 AND MORE FOOT THE LIGHT PROJECTED WOULD BE VERY WEAK AND NOT WELL TO BE DISCERNED BUT TO MAKE IT BRIGHTER A GREATER LANTERN MUST BE GOT AND A BIGGER WICK PUT IN AND OTHER THINGS ORDERED ACCORDINGLY SIXTHLY IF IT SHOULD BE TOO TROUBLESOME TO TO FIX SUCH A LONG MAST OF A 100 AND MORE FOOT THE AUTHOR SHEWETH HOW THE COMPOSITION OF MASTS JOYNING ONE TO ANOTHER MAY BE CONTINUED AS FAR AS NE CESSITY SHALL REQUIRE YET FOR ALL THAT HE THINKS THERE WILL BE NO NEED TO MAKE THESE MASTS OF SUCH A VAST HEIGHT FOR NO BODY WILL BRING THE TELESCOPES TO SUCH A PERFECTION AS TO MAKE APPEAR ANY ANIMAL OR CREATURE IN THE MOON OR PLANETS BECAUSE FIRST THERE IS SUCH A DIFFICULTY IN MAKING THE GLAS SES FOR THE BIGGER THEY ARE THE MORE ART IS REQUIRED IN PER FORMING THEM 2 THERE IS SCARCE ANY PIECE OF GLASS TO BE FOUND FIT FOR SUCH A LARGE BUSINESS BEING PESTERED WITH MANY FAULTS 3 THE AMPLIFICATION OF THE THINGS SEEN BY TELE SCOPES BEING REGULATED BY THE BIGNESS OF THE APERTURE THAT THE670 THE OBJECTIVE GLASS WILL BE IN SOMUCH THAT THE APERTURES ARE IN A SUBDUPLE REASON TO THE LENGTHS IT FOLLOWETH THAT A TE LESCOPE OF 30 FOOT REQUIRING AN APERTURE OF 3 INCHES TO AN O THER OF 300 FOOT THAT WILL BEAR NO MORE THEN 9 INCHES AND A HALF IS AS 1 TO 3 THAT IS WILL MAGNIFY BUT 3 TIMES AS MUCH BUT IF IT SHOULD MAKE 10 TIMES AS BIG IT WOULD RQUIRE A LENGTH OF 3000 FOOT WHICH HE THINKETH NOT TO BE PRACTICABLE 4TH THERE ARE STILL SOME IRREGULARITIES IN THE NATURE OF REFRACTIONSAS IS PROVED BY MR NEWTON EXPERIMENTS OF COLOUR YET AS FAR AS IS KNOWN THE SAID REASON OF THE APERTURES TO THE LENGTHS IS THEREBY CONFIRMED FINALLY FOR THE BETTER USE OF THIS TELESCOPE HE GIVETH AN ADMONITION THAT TO OBSERVE THE SATELLITS OF SATURN FOUND OUT BY  IT IS CONVENIENT TO LOOK THROUGH A NARROW APERTURE TO EXCLUDE THE LIGHT THAT COMETH FROM THE SIDES AND TO RESTRAIN THE APPLE OF THE EYE WHICH IN THE DARK USE TO BE VERY LARGE AND OPEN OXFORD PRINTED AT THE THEATER AND ARE TO BE SOLD BY MOSES

RICHMOND TRIMBLE V COMMONWEALTH March 23 1899 1 CONSTITUTIONAL LAWAct valid in part and void in partContemptsAppeal and crrorA statute may be constitutional in some of its provisions and unconstitutional in others but if the parts can be so separated as that each can stand as the will of the legislature the good does not perish with the bad Under this rule the act of February 26 1898 Acts 18978 p 548 in so far as it allows an appeal to this court in cases of contempt is constitutional 2 CONTEMPTSDisclaimerLack of evidenceIn a proceeding for contempt for failure to obey a lawful order of court in the absence of evidence that the act complaired of which rendered obedience impossible was done for the pur pose of defeating the jurisdiction and authority of the court and when the facts shown do not naturally bear such an interpretation upon disclaimer by the defendant of such a purpose he should be discharged Error to a judgment of the Corporation Court of the city of Lynch burg rendered May 4 1898 in a proceeding for a contempt of court Reversed The opinion states the case JE M Ford and R D Yancey for the plaintiff in error Attorney General A J Montague for the Commonwealth KEITH P delivered the opinion of the court One Susie Fox filed her petition in the Corporation Court for the city of Lynchburg alleging that she is the mother of a female child five years of age named Lillian May Fox that she had theretofore placed this child with a certain Ella Trimble to keep and care for during the petitioners expected absence from the city of Lynchburg with the understanding that the child would be delivered to her on her return Ella Trimble refused upon the mothers demand to restore the child to her custody and thereupon this petition was filed praying for a writ of habeas corpus A rule to show cause against the writ was issued and upon the answer made by Ella Trimble the court entered the following order Upon consideration of the within petition and answer and the evidence the  Reported by M P Burks State Reporter June 92TRIMBLE V COMMONWEALTH court doth remand the child Lillian May Fox to the custody of Ella Trimble until the further order of the court May 10 1897 On the 22d of March 1898 the following order was entered in this proceeding It is ordered that the defendant Ella Trimble do produce the body of Lillian May Fox in court on the first day of the next term of the said Corporation Court for the city of Lynchburg and show cause if any she can why the said order heretofore made on the said 10th day of May 1897 should not be revoked In compliance with this order Ella Trimble filed her answer in which she states the proceedings up to that time and then goes on to say that when the case was before the court in May 1897 and the child was remanded to her custody she understood it to be the wish of the court that she should either place the child in some private family or at a school where it would be properly cared for that in order to effect this object she went with the child to Wake county N C where at the suggestion of her sister Mollie Trimble and acting under the advice of counsel a guardian upon motion of her sister was appointed by the Superior Court of that county that the child had since been placed with one W E Bonner who the evidence shows to be a kindhearted honest and industrious citizen Re spondent further states that  when she took this child it was in a sick and starving conditionwhen neither the law nor any person on its behalf gave it any attention that she has spent more than a year of sleepless and anxious nights in watching and coaxing the little spark of vitality into life and that the child has gradually improved under her care The answer further avers that she is unable to comply with the mandate of the court to produce the body of the child before it that she no longer has the care and control of it that she has no desire to evade the process of the court and in an amended answer filed at a subsequent day she specifically disclaims any contempt of court The court certifies inthe record that it did not consider either the relator or respondent a suitable person to have the child that in the summer of 1897 respondent asked if it would be wrong for her to take the child on a short visit to her sister in Raleigh N C and was informed by the judge of the court that it would not be if she would not keep it away that while on this visit her sister who is not a proper person to have the child qualified in a North Carolina court as its guardian and the child has never returned 1899 93VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Upon the consideration of the rule answer and exhibits filed with it and the facts thus stated by the court it was of opinion that the answer of Ella Trimble was insufficient and entered an order that  she be attached until she produces the body of the said child in the proceedings mentioned before this court or until the further order of the court To this judgment a writ of error was awarded With respect to some of the questions presented we refer without further comment to the opinion of the court in Carters Case decided at the present term which is so far as applicable to the case made a part of this opinion We are of opinion however that the act of the legislature of 18978 which was in that case adjudged to be unconstitutional in some of its aspects is a valid statute in so far as it gives this court jurisdiction upon writ of error to review this judgment That a statute may be constitutional in part and unconstitutional as to some of its provisions is well settled See Homestead Cases 22 Gratt 266 Wisc v Rogers 24 Gratt 169 and Black v Trower 79 Va at page 127 where it is said  It is true that a statute in some of its provisions may be unconstitutional and void and in others valid and enforceable But when the valid part is so con nected with and dependent on that which is void as that the parts are not dis tinctly separable so that each can stand as the will of the legislature the whole must fall But the converse is equally true and where the parts may be so separated as that each can stand as the will of the legislature the good does not perish with the bad We are of opinion that the case is properly before us by virtue of the act of 18978 p 548 We gather from the record that plaintiff in error took this child which had been restored to her custody by the order of May 10 1897 to North Carolina with the assent of the Corporation Court of Lynch burg and with the intention of carrying out a commendable purpose sanctioned by the court with respect to this little waif When in North Carolina at the suggestion of her sister and upon her motion and acting under the advice of counsel a court of competent jurisdic tion in that State was requested to appoint and did appoint a guar dian for this little child That guardian seems to have made an arrangement with respect to the childs nurture of a beneficial char acter and there is no evidence that in thus acting the respondent did so with the object of defeating the jurisdiction and authority of the 94 JuneHAIRSTON V COMMONWEALTH Corporation Court of Lynchburg She disclaims any such purpose and beyond the facts stated which do not necessarily or it may be said even naturally bear such an interpretation we are of opinion that the offence wherewith she was charged has not been established and that the Corporation Court of Lynchburg erred in the judgment rendered which is reversed Reversed HAIRSTON v COMMONWEALTH Supreme Court of Appeals At Richmond March 23 1899 1 CRIMINAL LAW AND PROCEDURE VerdictCertaintyNaming prisoner or per son assaulted The verdict in a criminal case is always to be read in connection with the indictment and if upon reading them together the meaning of the verdict is certain that is sufficient The verdict need not give the name of the prisoner nor of the person assaulted 2 RAPEAttemptEvidence of force actual or intended To sustain the charge of an attempt to commit rape there must be evidence of force or of an inten tion on the part of the accused to use force in the perpetration of the offence if it should become necessary to overcome the will of his victim The evi dence must be not only consistent with his guilt but inconsistent with his innocence Error to a judgment of the County Court of Henry county rendered November 14 1898 on an indictment against the plaintiff in error for attempt to commit rape Reversed There was a demurrer to the indictment which was overruled and thereupon the

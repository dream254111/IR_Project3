See In re Perpall C C A 1919 256 Fed 758 760 People v Mills Sing Cal 1919 183 Pac 865 867 But here no such contrary intention appears Since the par ties agreed upon the price per pound and the number of bales the mistake in pay ment was merely in the performance of the contract Therefore title passed on the delivery of the goods and the receipt of the draft The dictum of the court that the appropriate remedy was contract is sound Where the vendor through a mis take in computation offers his goods at a certain lump sum he is held to that figure Tatum v Coast Lumber Co 1909 16 Ida 471 101

vendor has performed and the mistake is merely in the computation of the total due under the agreement he may recover the unpaid balance Union Electric Light Co v Surgical Supply Co 1907 122 Mo App 631 99 S W 804 Alleghany County v Thoma 1906 31 Pa Super Ct 102 In the principal case since the price per pound was evidently agreed upon and the vendee should have known of the mistake in computation the vendor can recover the balance of the correct contract price The defendant contracted to pay for fifty bales at a certain price per pound and is bound to do so Cf Union L Co v J W Schonten  Co

COLUMBIA LAW REV 442 445 The defect in the plaintiffs bill may be termed want of mutuality of performance The New York courts have extended this doctrine to cases where the court has the power to compel complete perform ance but the defendant could not have filed a bill to compel the plaintiff to perform 328 East 26th Street Realty Co v Kahn Sup Ct 1920 184 N Y Supp 95 Schuyler v KirkBrown Realty Co 1920 184 N Y Supp 95 Wadick v Mace 1908 191 N Y 1 83 N E 571 The alleged defect here may be termed want of mutuality of obligations The courts failed to realize that the plaintiff by com ing into court has waived his immunity so that the court may now compel him to perform In the principal case however the plaintiff has already performed and even in New York this is held to entitle him to specific performance Brune v Von Lehn 1920 112 Misc 342 183 N Y Supp 360 McKinley v Hessen 1911 202 N Y 24 95 N E 32 The performance must be substantial and in direct execution of the agreement See McKinley v Hessen supra Wheeler v Reynolds 1876 66 N Y 227 231 The courts do not discuss mutuality but base their de cision upon the ground that where the defendant has stood by and permitted the plaintiff to perform it would be inequitable to allow him to avoid performance on his own part See Woolley v Stewart 1918 222 N Y 347 351 118 N E 847 848 The New York courts are correct in granting specific performance where the plainRECENT DECISIONS 103 tiff has performed However no principle supports them in refusing it when the plaintiff though not originally bound has submitted himself to the jurisditcion of the court and can now be compelled to perform TRADE UNIONSPICKETINGINTIMIDATIONThe defendants white workers for the plaintiff company struck and picketed the plaintiffs mill As a result the negro nonstriking employees remained away from work until the pickets were withdrawn pursuant to an injunction issued on the ground of intimidation of the negroes by the strikers The controlling evidence consisted of affidavits by the negroes showing some threats and acts of violence by the strikers These statements were subsequently recanted at a meeting of the strikers In his finding of intimida tion the judge below intimated that the acts of the pickets would not have put white workmen in fear The defendants appealed Held appeal dismissed King et al v Weiss Lesh Mfg Co C C A 1920 266 Fed 257 On the ground that picketing necessarily implied violence some courts consid ered all picketing unlawful Pierce v Stablemens Union 1909 156 Cal 70 103 Pac 324 Beck v Railway Teamsters Union 1898 118 Mich 497 77 N W 13 Now the general rule is that peaceable picketing for the purpose of persuasion or entreaty is not unlawful Karges Furniture Co v Amalgamated Woodworkers Union 1905 165 Ind 421 7 5N E 877 see Jones v Van Winkle Machine Works 1908 131 Ga 336 62 S E 236 Rogers v Evarts 1891 17 N Y Supp 264 However when the picketing operates on the fears of the nonstrikers rather than on their judgment it is unlawful intimidation Local Union No 313 v Stathakis 1918 135 Ark 86 205 S W 450 Atchison etc Ry v Gee C C 1905 139 Fed 582 Duress not persuasion should be restrained and punished See Iron Mould ers Union v AllisChalmers Co 1908 166 Fed 45 51 Generally courts have been careful to point out that picketing is intimidating only when there has been actual violence or a display of force inspiring an apprehension of danger such as the massing of large numbers of strikers the calling of opprobrious names threatening gestures and the like American Steel  Wire Co v Wire Drawers Union C C 1898 90 Fed 608 see Michaels v Hillman 1920 112 Misc 395 183 N Y Supp 195 But an injunction will issue even if the pickets acts speech and numbers would not intimidate men of ordinary courage and determination for the weaker and more timid workers should also be able to come and go without mental dis turbance See Union Pac R R v Ruef C C 1902 120 Fed 102 Atchison etc Ry v Gee supra Conceding that negroes in this locality might more easily be intimidated than white men the evidence of their being subjected in the instant case to that form of intimidation which is a basis for injunctive relief seems slender especially since they outnumbered the strikers more than seven to one See People v Wilzig 1886 4 N Y Cr R 403 414 American Steel  Wire Co v Wire Drawers Union supra Notwithstanding the fact that Section 20 of the Clayton Act 1914 38 Stat 730 2 U S Comp Stat 1916 1243d applicable to this case permits peaceable picketing the court seemed to think that merely because the negroes stayed away owing to the presence of the pickets and returned after they were withdrawn therefore the picketing was intimidating This amountts to saying that peacable picketing is unlawfula doctrine which nullifies the Clayton Act and is against the weight of modern authority WILLSAPPORTION MENTCUMULATIVE PREFERRED SHARESThe testator bequeathed to his son

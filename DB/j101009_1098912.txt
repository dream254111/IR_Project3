negotiable note and mortgage as against an innocent purchaser for value and before maturity Justice Winslow speaking for the court said in part There is some conflict in the authorities upon the question whether the de fense of duress by threats can be successfully urged against a bonafide holder for value of negotiable paper but the better opinion and weight of authority is that such defense stands upon the same footing as other defenses which may be made as between the original parties but is cut off when the paper reaches the hands of a bona fide holder Fairbanks v Snow 145 Mass 153 Bank v Butler 48 Mich 192 Clark v Pease 41 N H 414 Beals v Neddo 1 McCrary 206 M3artineau v McCollum 3 Pin 455 4 Am  Eng Enc Law 2d Ed p 334 Duress which consists of threats of imprisonment of a husband or a child is a spicies of fraud which renders the contract made under the influence voidable only and not void Bank v Kusworm 91 Wis 166 If it be simply a voidable contract then it follows naturally that when the contract consists of negotiable paper the1899 MISCELLANY 335 defense is cut off by transfer to a bona fide purchaser before maturity in the same manner that other defenses upon the ground of fraud are cut offChicago Law Journal Mr Daniel while conceding that there is some authority for the doctrine that duress is a mere equity which is cut off by transfer of the paper to a holder in due course maintains that violent duress such as to affect a man of reasonable firmness and courage is an absolute defense by the maker even against a bona fide holder for value We quite agree with the learned author in the following sum ming up of his discussion of the question  Indeed we can discern no principle which would compel any person whether a party to a negotiable or other kind of instrument to pay it when under violent duressthat is under the compulsion of force with the only alternative of sub mitting to great bodily injury or indignity Consent is of the essence of every contract and if it is not given the party should not be bound if he had no alter native but to seem to give it or suffer grievous wrong He creates no trust he commits no negligence whereby the confidence of another can be betrayed He is in no default having the right of selfdefense in preferring his own life and safety to the chances of pecuniary injury to others and his extorted act is noth ing more nor less than the act of the wrongdoer who uses his person as the in strument of forging his name 1 Daniel Neg Instr 4th ed 858 PROPOSES JOHN B MINOR MEMORIAL BUILDINGMr James B Green

People ex rel Colorado Bar Association v Weeber reported in the Chicago Legal News for June 3 1899 the Supreme Court of Colorado struck from its rolls an attorney who had been indicted convicted and fined in a court of the United States for making an unlawful use of the United States mails The fact that he had satisfied the fine adjudged against him did not prevent his being disbarred for the same offense The court might have dis barred him although he had not been prosecuted or convicted since conduct of this kind demonstrates the unfitness of the person guilty of it for membership in the legal profession Our readers will note that the proceeding was had on the relation of the Colorado Bar Association Such proceedings properly taken conducted without prejudice and carefully guarding the rights of the accused demonstrate the usefulness of bar associations and tend to convince those at torneys who need such admonitions that there is a disciplinary body connected with their profession that can call them to account for misconduct therein American Law Review The subject of professional ethics evidently has a strong hold on the judges who preside over the Supreme Court of Colorado In a recent case before that court an attorney was disbarred for advertising for divorce cases accompanying his bid for the dirty business by the published statement that divorces could be obtained by him quietly and without publicity The court based its action in disbarring the advertiser on two grounds First that it was against public policy and con trary to good morals to lead married couples to believe that divorces could be obtained secretly since this would tempt many couples to apply for divorces who would otherwise be deterred from taking such a step from a wholesome fear of public opinion and second that a representation that divorces could be obtained without publicity was a false representation and a libel upon the courts of justice People v MacCabe 18 Col 186 36 Am St Rep 270 The same court at the same term disbarred another attorney for entering into a conspiracy to defraud a third person and in the course of the opinion laid down the following wholesome doctrine The duties imposed upon members of the bar clothe them with important fiduciary responsibilities and make them amenable to obligations that other mem ber of the community do not share In no other calling should so strict an adherence to ethical and moral obligations be exacted or so high a degree of accountability be enforced A good moral character is one of the essential requisites to admission to the bar in this State and the tenure of office thereby conferred is during good be havior and when it appears upon full investigation that an attorney has for feited his  good moral character and has by his conduct shown himself unworthy of his office it becomes the duty of the court to revoke the authority it gave him upon his admission It is a duty they owe to themselves the bar and the public to see that a power which may be wielded for good or for evil is not entrusted to incompetent or dishonest hands People v Keegan 18 Col 237 36 Am St Rep 274 A full collection of authorities on this subject will be found in State v Kirke 12 Fla 278 and an extensive note thereto in 95 Am Dec 333345 See also monographic note to In re Philbrook Cal 45 Am St Rep 7186 336 Sept 1899 MISCELLANY 337 THE PRELIMINARY TRAINING OF A LAW STUDENT We alluded in our June number to the efforts which were being made by the Chicago Bar Association looking to the establishment of a higher professional standard among the attor neys of that city In addition to publishing the names of a number who were practicing law without being duly licensed the Association opposed the admission of certain students under the recent Campbell act and the Supreme Court lias rendered an opinion in the matter of the application of Day and others law stu dents to be admitted to practice in which it finds the act in question unconstitu tional and holds that the legislature has no power to pass a law controlling the admission of members of the bar as the latter are officers of the court and there fore under its direct control It may be necessary to remark for the benefit of such as have not followed up this case that on November 4 1897 the Supreme Court adopted a rule providing for a State board of law examiners to be appointed by it and fixing the minimum course of study for students at three years Thereupon an act was introduced and passed in the legislature exempting from the operation of this rule all stu dents who had begun the study of law prior to its adoption In the rendered opinion the court observed that  it is our duty to maintain the provisions of the constitution that no person or collection of persons being one of the departments of government shall exercise a power properly belonging to an other and if the legislature by inadvertency as in this case assumes the exercise of a power belonging to the judicial department it should only be necessary to call its attention to the restraint imposed by the constitution Whatever may have been the propriety of the rule admitting the holder of a diploma issued by a law school to practice in view of the law schools existing at its adoption the rule has been an alarming menace to the administration of jus tice particularly in Cook county where the injurious consequences were mainly felt In view of the disastrious consequences to the profession and the public the rule by which it was only a step from the diploma mill to the bar was changed and in an effort to discharge a duty to the public the general standard of admis sion is raised That the change was a wise one and one that will tend to pro mote the public welfare is not denied by counsel for applicants who desire to elevate the standard of the bar and assure us that they sympathize with us in our effort in that direction It is conceded that when the rule was made November 4 1897 the court had full power to make it and to fix the standard of admission It was a valid rule of the court acting within its unquestioned jurisdiction and the question is whether tle legislature could rightfully encroach upon a power belonging to the judicial department and set aside the rule There seems to be too much of a disposition to throw wide open the doors of the temple of justice for the purpose of admitting to professional life the poor but worthy young man who has not had the means sufficient to obtain proper training While we have the utmost sympathy for the individual in question and recognize the hardship to which he is subject we yet fail to see any good reason why he should be turned loose upon the community at large wanting a sufficient preliminary education filled with ill digested principles and lacking in training sufficient to warrant a hope of their final thorough comprehension with a smat tering of the law of procedure sufficient to enable him to finally become a prac338 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Sept titioner through experience obtained at the expense of clients although during the entire period custom has allowed him the privilege of charging ten times the compensation obtained for an equal expenditure of time and brains by an ordinary mechanic who has served an apprenticeship of twice as long a time In some of the States we are informed that the only requirement for admission to the bar is a good moral character Even in New York as Redfield re marks the liberal tendencies which gave birth to the Constitution of 1846 mani fested themselves in 1847 by a legislative provision that any person of good moral character although not admitted as an attorney might manage prosecute or defend a suit for any other person provided he was specially authorized for that purpose by the party for whom he appeared in writing or by personal nomina tion in open court Laws 1847 ch 470 sec 46 But that provision was declared unconstitutional became obsolete and has been expressly repealed McKoan v Devries 3 Barb 196 Laws 1880 ch 245 sec 1 subdiv 24 The matter in question is one which the bar at large might as well recognize as being of the greatest importance one which must be solved by the courts and the law schools for as the Illinois appellate tribunal observed the legislature has properly no control over the officers of the court With them rests the obliga tion of determining whether the coming bar will be our pride or our disgrace Custom in this country has long since recognized the existence of a noblesse of the robe The duty is upon the bar associations as guardians of the fair name of the attorney and counsellor to manifest more interest than has been previously shown by them upon the subject and the action of the Chicago Bar Association has pointed it out as the noble poineer in a worthy cause It is in this connec tion that we can commend to the hearty approval of all the course adopted by a number of eastern law schools in raising the standard of professional training American Lawyer LEGISLATION RECOMMENDED FOR THE DISBARMENT OF ATTORNEYS FOR UN PROFESSIONAL CONDUCTThe State Bar Association at its recent meeting approved certain amendments to the Code with reference to the disbarment of attorneys and instructed the proper committee to present the same to the legisla ture at its next session and to advocate their passage The amendments if adopted will in our opinion place the law of this subject on a better basis than it has been heretofore in Virginia and it is to be hoped will do much toward ridding the bar of those members who disgrace the profession and toward maintaining that high standard of professional ethics for which the bar of Virginia has always stood The proposed amendments are in the following form A BILL to amend and reenact sections 3195 and 3196 of the Code of Virgiinia and to repeal section 3197 of the same Code 1 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of Virginia That sections 3195 and 3196 of the Code of Virginia be amended and reenacted so as to read as follows Section 3195 Any court before which an attorney has qualified on proof being made that he has been convicted of a felony or of any malpractice or of any1899 MISCELLANY 339 corrupt unprofessional conduct shall revoke his license to practise therein or suspend the same for such time as the court may prescribe Section 3196 If the Supeme Court of Appeals or any court of record in this State observes any malpractice or any corrupt unprofessional conduct therein by an attorney or if complaint verified by affidavit be made to any such court of malpractice or of corrupt unprofessional conduct by an attorney therein or if complaint verified by affidavit be made to any court of record other than the Supreme Court of Appeals of any malpractice or any corrupt unprofessional con duct by an attorney practising therein such court shall issue a rule against such attorney to show cause why his license to practise law shall not be revoked or suspended Upon the return of such rule a jury shall be impaneled when required by the defendant and if he be found guilty by the court or by the jury where one is impaneled his license to practise in such court shall be revoked or suspended for such time as the court may prescribe When the case is in the Supeme Court of Appeals the court shall direct one of its officers to summon a jury from the county or corporation in which said court is then being held to be impaneled and paid as in eases of misdemeanor in the county or corporation court and any revocation or suspension of license by said Supreme Court of Appeals shall operate and be effective in all the courts of this commonwealth If the case be in a county court the defendant or the party making the complaint or the court of its own motion shall have the right to remove the same to the circuit court of the county to be proceeded with therein as if the case had originated in the latter court Any judgment of conviction upon such removal shall operate to revoke or suspend the license of the defendant to practise in such county and circuit court The words any malpractice or any corrupt unprofessional con duct as used in this section shall be construed to include the failure without sufficient cause of an attorney at law to pay over and deliver to the person entitled thereto within a reasonable time any money security or property which has come into his hands as such attorney In any proceeding to revoke or suspend the license of an attorney under this or the preceding section the complainant shall be entitled to representation by counsel 2 Be it further enacted That section 3197 of the Code of Virginia be and the same is liereby repealed 3 This act shall be in force from its passage CONTRACTUAL POWERS OF MARRIED WOMEN IN VIRGINIAWVe are per mitted to publish the following note from the advance sheets of Hursts Virginia Digest on the subject of the wifes contractual powers If any of our readers are disposed to believe that this subject is an editorial hobby attention is called to the fact that at least three numbers of the current volume have contained no refer ence to it The REGISTER is glad to welcome Mr Hurst into the small but select circle of those who would give the feme her just dues under the statute Under section 2288 of the Code a married woman may make contracts as if sole in respect to such trade business labor services and her said separate estate or upon the faith and credit thereof By section 2295 every contract hereafter made by a married woman which she hasVIRGINIA LAW REGISTER the power to make she cannot contract as to her common law lands or her after acquired equitable estate nor as a partner with her husband shall be deemed to be made without regard to her intention to charge but in pursuance of statutory authority pure and simple with reference to her estate which is made her separate estate by this chapter as a source of credit and every such contract shall be deemed as intended to be made based entirely upon intention which is irrefutably pre sumed and limited necessarily to existing estate with reference to her equitable separate estate also if any she has her contract does not bind such estate acquired afterwards as a source of credit to the extent of her power over the same unless the contrary intention is expressed in the contract subject to an exception contained in section 2502 If these were the only provisions on the subject of a wifes power to contract one might possibly conclude that her power of contracting as to her separate estate under the Code is limited and measured by the estate owned by her at the time as in the cases of her equitable separate estate and her legal separate estate under the Act of 1877 but even then the particular wording of the above sections with the use of the clause if any she has and the phrases in respect to and u pon the faith and credit thereof in lieu of the phrase in relation to as used in the Act of 1877 together with the enlarged policy for the financial emancipa tion of a married woman as shown in sections 22847 defining her separate estate and her rights and power in respect thereto might offer some obstruction to this view But if these provisions do not  make a man of her section 2289 is at least another step in that direction for it provides that  a personal judgment or decree may be rendered for or against her and when against her the same may be en forced against her and any separate estate she has or may subsequently acquire but only against such estatenot against her common law lands or her after acquired equitable separate estatein the same manner as if she were unmar ried While it may be true that the remedy on a contract cannot enlarge the power to contract or the rights under it yet the remedy and the power to contract are commensurate with each other and antipodal and are equal counterparts of one entire thing towit a debt contracted and satisfied So that the section defin ing the remedy should be looked to in construing the section conferring the power to contract and as the remedy is prospective in its scope extending to after acquired property so her contract is prospective in its objects upon the faith and credit of such afteracquired estate As to whether a married woman must first have some property to qualify her to contract at all this is not expressly required by the statute and if not expressly required what policy or purpose is served by implying such a prerequisite  Evi dently she may bind ultimatelywhen judgment is obtainedwhat she did not have at the time she made the contract Why then may she not do this in the first instance without having any property at the time Unless there is some imperative rule of construction grounded in a wise and sensible policy requiring it the courts will be reluctant in the absence of a clearly expressed intention to read into the statute a useless and senseless restriction upon her power The courts will be loath indeed to charge the legislature with the folly of doing a foolish thing when a sensible reasonable construction may be placed upon their work Besides what intricacies and entanglements we should encounter if we admit 340 Sept this property qualification How much property What kind Homespun gingham cracked mirrors and brass breast pins   A brindled cow with short tail   Rights in action for a tort to her person while a suit therefor is yet pend ing etc etc etc If she must have a property qualification in order to attain unto the important status of a contracting feme sole let the custom be at once established of a gift by father mother sister brother or friend upon her marriage or attaining her ma jority of a five dollar gold piece or the like and let the gift be called the emancipation piece We should thereby hand down to remote posterity a custom as unique and strange and silly as any we ever inherited from the ancient common law Judge Burks it seems M P Burks his learned son and a distinguished writer Mr Barton and others think a property qualification is indispensable See 1 Va Law Reg 357 Burks Prop R of Mar Women 81 3 Va Law Reg 797 4 Va Law Reg 460 630 2 Bart Chy Prac 2d ed 1132 while Prof W M Lile stands almost solitary and alone in maintaining the

adopted by the Illinois State Bar Association July 7 1899 On February 4 1801 John Marshall took his seat in the Supreme Court of the United States as the third chief justice on a commission signed by President John Adams dated January 31 1801 He sat in the court thirtyfour years The 4th of February 1901 will fall on Monday and I propose as a member of the bar that the legal profession of the United States celebrate Monday Feb ruary 4 1901 as John Marshall Day in order to commemorate the great event which gave to the people of the United States the powerful mind of Marshall and harmony and strength to the great instrument the Constitution of the United States This will likely be the first centennial day in the twentieth century and if the suggestion shall be adopted the occasion will be the peacefully determined expression of the bench and bar of the United States that constitutional govern ment shall remain with us in its full unimpaired strength in the twentieth cen tury and through the centuries to come The celebration of this day by the bench and bar of the United States will bring together the greatest assemblage of lawyers and judges which the world has ever witnessed and the dedication of the day will mark an event unexampled in the history of Englishspeaking lawyers and judges It is proposed that the judicial department of the government both state and national shall be the principal actor in this national celebration and it is also suggested that the executive and legislative branches of the government shall participate John Marshall for a brief time was Secretary of State under President Adams and was one of the envoys sent to France He was also a member of Congress 1899 341 MISCELLANY342 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Sept Hence it is most fitting that the executive as well as the legislative branches of the government shall participate It is proposed that an exalted meeting take place in the Supreme Court chambers of the United States at Washington to which the president the vicepresident the speaker of the house the members of the cabinet and other dignitaries be invited on which occasion by direction of the chief justice the judicial life and character of Chief Justice Marshall shall be the principal theme of the orator It is further proposed that a like celebration take place in the joint houses of Congress It is further proposed that on said day of celebration every court house in the United States shall be closed to secular business and that suitable ceremonies take place commemorative of the great national event The law schools in the United States the universities and faculties of professors may also consider this day as their own so that constitutional knowledge and betterment of republican government may be advanced It is also proposed that on that day members of the bar shall be designated by boards of education to address the scholars of the public schools for the purpose of making the name of John Marshall a household word in the land In this manner the orators of the day will emphasize the great influence which Chief Justice Marshall has exercised upon the people and government of the United States and the event must necessarily bring great and lasting results in its train The powerful aid of the secular and legal press towards this movement will not be undervalued In order to give effect to this idea it is proposed to present a suitable memorial to the American Bar Association at its next August session at Buffalo accom panied with proper resolutions to the effect that the American Bar Association appoint a special committee representing all the States and Territories to take charge of this subject and work out a plan of celebration for submission to the organized body of the bench and bar and other public bodies in the United States It is also proposed that such committee appoint an editor or a number of editors to prepare a commemorative volume which besides biographical data of the Chief Justice will largely deal with his constitutional opinions in order that their influence may be widened throughout the nonprofessional world It is proposed to interest in this matter eminent judges statesmen and lawyers who may be induced to indorse the idea herein suggested before it is finally sub mitted for action to the American Bar Association These are merely the outlines of the thought which has lately come to me and which may be extended in all reasonable directions The proposition is in my judgment a feasible one and will be a profound appeal to the intelligence and patriotism of the bench and bar of the United States to whom these outlines are respectfully submitted by an ardent admirer of Chief Justice Marshall and the farreaching work which he did for the people of the United States On motion of General John C Black of the Chicago Bar the above proposi tion was unanimously adopted by the Illinois State Bar Association with in structions to its delegates to the American Bar Association to present it at its next session in Buffalo N Y August 28 29 30 18991899 MISCELLANY 343 In connection with the foregoing the Virginia State Bar Association at its recent meeting at Hot Springs adopted the following resolution prepared by Hon Bev erly B Munford of the Richmond bar Resolved That the Virginia State Bar Association regards with sentiments of earnest approval the movement recently inaugurated by the Illinois State Bar As sociation upon the motion of Hon Adolph Moses of the Chicago bar to celebrate in an appropriate manner the coming centennial anniversary of the elevation of John Marshall to the position of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States His exalted character as a man his preeminence as a jurist and his illustrious services in the making of the Union entitle him to the lasting venera tion and affection of all his countrymen The lawyers of Virginia with peculiar pride will cordially unite in any movement to commemorate his labors and to exalt his fame Resolved further That a committee of five be appointed by the President to communicate to the American Bar Association at its approaching meeting the passage of the foregoing resolution and to correspond with other bar associations and the bar generally looking to the accomplishment of the end in view making a report of their action to this body at its next session In pursuance of this resolution the President appointed the following committee Hon Beverly B Munford Richmond Hon L L Lewis Richmond John A Coke Richmond Jackson Guy Richmond James P Harrison Danville THE VIRGINIA STATE BAR ASSOCIATIONMEETING AT THE HOT SPRINGS The Eleventh Annual Meeting of the Virginia State Bar Association held at Hot Springs Va on August 1 2 and 3 was largely attended and as it seemed to us was an unusually pleasant one We arrived too late to hear the address of the President Hon John Goode but it is said to have been most interesting We hope to give it a more extended notice in some future number James P Harrison of Danville read a paper on the somewhat trite subject of Suggested Changes in our Judicial System The treatment of the theme how ever was original and the paper is a valuable contribution to the literature of this important subject Mr Harrisons suggestions are most of them intensely prac tical and if adopted would remove much of the widespread criticism to which our present judicial system is justly subject We hope to publish the paper in full at an early date The principal changes in our present judicial system urged in the paper are shown in the following outline kindly placed at our disposal by the author I Suggestions applicable to all courts 1 A constitutional inhibition of any judge practising law 2 A constitutional amendment definitely prescribing all judicial terms to be for the full number of years specified correcting the construction given by Burks v Hinton 3 A constitutional inhibition of the election to a judgeship of any member of the General Assembly344 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Sept II Suggestions applicable to the Supreme Court of Appeals 1 That all judges be required to wear a gown when on the bench 2 That the sessions of this court at Wytheville and Staunton be done away with and that it sit at Richmond only 3 That the records and briefs be printed in uniform style and bound copies be kept numbered to accord with the volumes of the Reports and that the printing be done by the parties under direction of the clerks of the lower courts III Suggestion as to the Circuit Courts That the circuits be rearranged and reduced to ten with a minimum salary of 2500 to the judges without mileage IV Suggestions as to the County Courts 1 That the present county courts be abolished 2 That the corporations and counties be thrown into districts to be presided over by judges with a minimum salary of 2000 who shall not practise law and with enlarged jurisdiction 3 That the county court clerks be given judicial functions in matters of probat roads etc and pro forma proceedings with appeal of right to the district courts 4 That the commonwealths attorneys for each county be abolished 5 That district attorneys be provided for The annual address by Hon Alexander Pope Humphrey of Louisville Ken tucky was the piece de resistance of the occasion The subject of the address was The Impeachment of Samuel Chase The speaker had his subject well in hand and spoke without reference to his manuscript To the intrinsic interest of his narrative he added an ease of manner and a grace of delivery which insured him the full sympathy of his audience from the beginning This sympathy closely followed him through his peroration and expressed itself with old Virginia en thusiasm too outspoken to leave any doubt upon the mind of the distinguished speaker that he had won his way to the hearts of the Virginia bar We are glad to be able to lay the address in full before our readers in the present number of the REGISTER The meeting closed as usual with the banquet on Thursday evening The after dinner speeches were unusually good Indeed we do not remember to liave at tended one of these famous banquets where the speeches were so uniformly well received The proprietors of the Hot Springs made everything as comfortable as possible for the members of the Association and we believe the experiences at this meet ing have served to reconcile every member who attended to the change from the former rendezvous of the Association at the White Sulphur Springs West Vir ginia to this newer atd even more delightful resort inside the State lines A pleasant innovation at this meeting were the informal receptions tendered to the members of the Association by Decatur Axtell Esq President of the Ilot Springs Company and by Mrs Decatur Axtell and Mrs Ingalls the latter the wife of President Ingalls of the Chesapeake  Ohio Railway Company to the ladies in attendance upon the meeting We are indebted to the obliging Secretary of the Association for the following extracts from his report The VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER which deserves the unanimous support of the1899 MISCELLANY 345 Bar has printed extracts from our reports and made frequent mention of the work being done by the Association It has quoted several articles from other law journals approving the use of judicial robes and has itself commented favor ably upon the resolutions passed by this Association at its last annual meeting recommending the adoption of gowns by our Supreme Court of Appeals All courts must take judicial notice of acts of the legislature and perhaps the best way to bring our resolution to the active attention of that honorable court would be to secure an appropriation from the legistature for the purchase of suitable and fitting gowns We had 431 active members on our rolls after our last annual meeting and since then we have lost eleven by death six by resignation and one by promotion to the honorary list to take the place of Judge McLaughlin who has died since making a total of eighteen but one has been reinstated and we have therefore at the beginning of our Eleventh Annual Meeting 414 active members Our honorary members of whom one has died but whose place has been filled as stated above number fortythree Our total membership therefore is 457 while a number of applicants are now seeking admission The following is a list of those who have become members of the Association since the last report NEW MEMBERS Anderson Henry W Richmond Batchelor 0 D

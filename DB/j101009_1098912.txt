SAME OFFENSE THE COURT MIGHT HAVE DIS BARRED HIM ALTHOUGH HE HAD NOT BEEN PROSECUTED OR CONVICTED SINCE CONDUCT OF THIS KIND DEMONSTRATES THE UNFITNESS OF THE PERSON GUILTY OF IT FOR MEMBERSHIP IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION OUR READERS WILL NOTE THAT THE PROCEEDING WAS HAD ON THE RELATION OF THE COLORADO BAR ASSOCIATION SUCH PROCEEDINGS PROPERLY TAKEN CONDUCTED WITHOUT PREJUDICE AND CAREFULLY GUARDING

PROFESSION THAT CAN CALL THEM TO ACCOUNT FOR MISCONDUCT THEREIN AMERICAN LAW REVIEW THE SUBJECT OF PROFESSIONAL ETHICS EVIDENTLY HAS A STRONG HOLD ON THE JUDGES WHO PRESIDE OVER THE SUPREME COURT OF COLORADO IN A RECENT CASE BEFORE THAT COURT AN ATTORNEY WAS DISBARRED FOR ADVERTISING FOR DIVORCE CASES ACCOMPANYING HIS BID FOR THE DIRTY BUSINESS BY THE PUBLISHED STATEMENT THAT DIVORCES COULD BE OBTAINED BY HIM QUIETLY AND WITHOUT PUBLICITY THE COURT BASED ITS ACTION IN DISBARRING THE ADVERTISER ON TWO GROUNDS FIRST THAT IT WAS AGAINST PUBLIC POLICY AND CON TRARY TO GOOD MORALS TO LEAD MARRIED COUPLES TO BELIEVE THAT DIVORCES COULD BE OBTAINED SECRETLY SINCE THIS WOULD TEMPT MANY COUPLES TO APPLY FOR DIVORCES WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE DETERRED FROM TAKING SUCH A STEP FROM A WHOLESOME

CERTAIN STUDENTS UNDER THE RECENT CAMPBELL ACT AND THE SUPREME COURT LIAS RENDERED AN OPINION IN THE MATTER OF THE APPLICATION OF DAY AND OTHERS LAW STU DENTS TO BE ADMITTED TO PRACTICE IN WHICH IT FINDS THE ACT IN QUESTION UNCONSTITU TIONAL AND HOLDS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS NO POWER TO PASS A LAW CONTROLLING THE ADMISSION OF MEMBERS OF THE BAR AS THE LATTER ARE OFFICERS OF THE COURT AND THERE FORE UNDER ITS DIRECT CONTROL IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO REMARK FOR THE BENEFIT OF SUCH AS HAVE NOT FOLLOWED UP THIS CASE THAT ON NOVEMBER 4 1897 THE SUPREME COURT ADOPTED A RULE PROVIDING FOR A STATE BOARD OF LAW EXAMINERS TO BE APPOINTED BY IT AND FIXING THE MINIMUM COURSE OF STUDY FOR STUDENTS AT THREE YEARS THEREUPON AN ACT WAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED IN THE LEGISLATURE EXEMPTING FROM THE OPERATION OF THIS RULE ALL STU DENTS WHO HAD BEGUN THE STUDY OF LAW PRIOR TO ITS ADOPTION IN THE RENDERED OPINION THE COURT OBSERVED THAT  IT IS OUR DUTY TO MAINTAIN THE PROVISIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION THAT NO PERSON OR COLLECTION OF PERSONS BEING ONE OF THE DEPARTMENTS OF GOVERNMENT SHALL EXERCISE A POWER PROPERLY BELONGING TO AN OTHER AND IF THE LEGISLATURE BY INADVERTENCY AS IN THIS CASE ASSUMES THE EXERCISE OF A POWER BELONGING TO THE JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT IT SHOULD ONLY BE NECESSARY TO CALL ITS ATTENTION TO THE RESTRAINT IMPOSED BY THE CONSTITUTION WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN THE PROPRIETY OF THE RULE ADMITTING THE HOLDER OF A DIPLOMA ISSUED BY A LAW SCHOOL TO PRACTICE IN VIEW OF THE LAW SCHOOLS EXISTING AT ITS ADOPTION THE RULE HAS BEEN AN ALARMING MENACE TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUS TICE PARTICULARLY IN COOK COUNTY WHERE THE INJURIOUS CONSEQUENCES WERE MAINLY FELT IN VIEW OF THE DISASTRIOUS CONSEQUENCES TO THE PROFESSION AND THE PUBLIC THE RULE BY WHICH IT WAS ONLY A STEP FROM THE DIPLOMA MILL TO THE BAR WAS CHANGED AND IN AN EFFORT TO DISCHARGE A DUTY TO THE PUBLIC THE GENERAL STANDARD OF ADMIS SION IS RAISED THAT THE CHANGE WAS A WISE ONE AND ONE THAT WILL TEND TO PRO MOTE

WHEN THE RULE WAS MADE NOVEMBER 4 1897 THE COURT HAD FULL POWER TO MAKE IT AND TO FIX THE STANDARD OF ADMISSION IT WAS A VALID RULE OF THE COURT ACTING WITHIN ITS UNQUESTIONED JURISDICTION AND THE QUESTION IS WHETHER TLE LEGISLATURE COULD RIGHTFULLY ENCROACH UPON A POWER BELONGING TO THE JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT AND SET ASIDE THE RULE THERE SEEMS TO BE TOO MUCH OF A DISPOSITION TO THROW WIDE OPEN THE DOORS OF THE TEMPLE OF JUSTICE FOR THE PURPOSE OF ADMITTING TO PROFESSIONAL LIFE THE POOR BUT WORTHY YOUNG MAN WHO HAS NOT HAD THE MEANS SUFFICIENT TO OBTAIN PROPER TRAINING WHILE WE HAVE THE UTMOST SYMPATHY FOR THE INDIVIDUAL IN QUESTION AND RECOGNIZE THE HARDSHIP TO WHICH HE IS SUBJECT WE YET FAIL TO SEE ANY GOOD REASON WHY HE SHOULD BE TURNED LOOSE UPON THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE WANTING A

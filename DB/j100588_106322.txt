the said Fort Commu nicated by Sir John Pringle Bart P R S T H E manner in which I keep my me teorological observations is as follows A thermometer without doors a barometer and ther mometer within doors the barometer and thermometer within doors are kept close together for the sake of cor recting the barometer if required I observe them three times a day as per diary I also set down the direction and strength of the wind and the state of the weather I distinguish four degrees of strength of the wind namely gentle brisk stormy and what we call a tufoon in India which you will find marked with the numbers 1 2 3 and 4 besides no sensible wind which is marked with a cypher Read Jan 29 1777 I am ashamed to say that the raingage I had during the rainy season was so indifferent that I could not with any degree of certainty measure the quantity of rain that fellMr ROXBURGHS Meteorological Diary c 181 fell here I have now got a tin cylinder 5210ths inches in diameter or 16410ths inches in circumference and 30 inches deep the quantity of rain that falls I intend to mea sure with a scale divided into inches and twentieths of an inch the depth shall be set down every morning if it has rained I have it placed on the roof of my house which is about twentyfive feet high at a considerable distance from any other building c except the hospi tal which is distant about one hundred yards and of the same height no trees above twelve feet high within many hundred yards The thermometer without doors I have placed under a small shady tree through which the Sun cannot pene trate at the same time it is well exposed to air and wind Every inch on the scale of the barometer I use is divided into twenty equal parts it is a portable one made by RAMSDEN The tube of the thermometer without doors is twelve inches long placed upon a plain open boxwood scale made by NAIRNE and BLUNT A a 2 1776182 Mr ROXBURGHS Meteorological Diary c Hour from Therm Therm Winds State of the weather c

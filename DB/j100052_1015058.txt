Secretary of the National Child Labor Committee SOLOMON says that a good man leaveth an inheritance to his childrens children He does not tell us what kind of inheritance he had in mind as suitable for children but he says that houses and riches are the in heritance of fathers and as a father he says to children Wisdom is the princi pal thing therefore get wisdom and with all thy getting get understanding If this means that the proper inheri tance of children is wisdom and under standing then indeed is Solomon wise for she is more precious than rubies    length of days is in her right hand and in her left hand riches and honor Wisdom and understanding come of knowledge and experience those riches of the mind and heart and are added unto us through length of days Here we have the philosophy of child welfare work a lengthened childhood is the best inheritance we can leave to our children and to our childrens children for it is the way to wisdom and under standing to riches and honor BASIC PURPOSE OF CHILD WELFARE SERVICE The basic purpose of child welfare service whatever its kind and whatever its goal is to prolong the period of childhood Lengthened childhood is the warp of that fabric we are weaving to shield and equip our boys and girls On this basis we set up a structure for their good through this warp we run the woof the threads that make it strong The first threads are all those efforts that make secure the lengthened days of childhood all the work that is done to save children from disease and de formity and to promote their health and vitality the laws ordinances and agencies that stand between them and exploitation the measures that safe guard them from abuse the officers courts and institutions that lead them away from careers of crime The second are those threads that seek to equalize the conditions of life for child hood the steps that are taken to relieve the suffering of the poor and to put down the evil of poverty that great overflowing of hearts that goes to the care of the unfortunate and the handi capped And finally come the threads that lead to the heights beyond the schooling the training the guidance and the play that bring education and the joy of life Thus it is our task to lengthen child hood to make it safe to give a fair chance to those stricken in body mind or estate to provide training and recre ation for all Without these things neither the children of today nor those of tomorrow can lay up for themselves the treasures of wisdom and under standing they cannot inherit the riches whose price is above rubies With less than this inheritance for every child we must not be content No flower is born to waste its sweetness on the desert air That any waste their sweetness is our fault and we should not cease from striving till every bud unfolds its petals in a world of op portunity No child is born to a bar ren life but every one has in him some power however slight to swell the sum total of our happiness Ours is the duty to prepare the way so that he can 154THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHILDRENS CODE use this power his is the duty to use it The instrument imperfect and in complete as it is that we have devised for insuring to every child as fair a start in life as it is possible to give him is com monly known as the childrens code This has developed out of the ex perience of those who in various ways have served the public interest through serving children Its growth has been gradual of course but it is only within recent years that all the accumulated experience has been brought to bear in any logical manner upon the prepara tion of a broad and coordinated program Efforts toward this end have con verged in an expression of the principles underlying child care the formulation of standards to govern such care in ac cordance with modern thought and the embodiment of these standards into law and practice with such modifica tions in the different states as special circumstances might require or public opinion dictate The declaring of principles and the framing of standards clears the air and points the way it sets up a mark toward which to work and shows why we should strive to reach it The writing of the standards into the statutes secures to us the enjoyment of our gains as they are won and records our progress toward sound theory and practice GROUNDWORK OF THE CHILDRENS CODE A striking instance of the attempt to set forth the principles underlying so cial work and to rear up standards on those principles occurred in 1909 when upon the invitation of President Roose velt a meeting of representative social workers since known as the White House Conference was held in Wash ington to consider the care of depend ent children The authoritative decla ration made on this occasion has ever since been the guide of social workers in the treatment and care of dependent and neglected children Another instance has been the agita tion for general recognition of certain standards concerning the employment of children in gainful occupations This agitation long carried on by na tional societies was given a more def inite objective in 1911 when the Na tional Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws approved a stand ard child labor bill which had been drawn at the request of this body by the National Child Labor Committee The measure was recommended by the commissioners to the several states for enactment into law with a view to legislative uniformity in this field and has been adopted in part at least by most of our commonwealths while its fundamental provisions have been written into the law of the nation Further the principles upon which the organization and procedure of juvenile courts are based have been stated the purposes and functions of probation have been made clear and standard bills have been drawn bylead ers for the use of states and smaller communities in dealing with juvenile delinquents Then at the National Conference of Charities and Correction held in Balti more in 1915 so much interest was shown in the correlation of child wel fare laws and of the work of administra tive agencies that an organization was effected to stimulate the childrens code movement throughout the country This organization took the name of the National Committee for Standardizing Child Welfare Laws At the National Conference of Social Work held in Mil waukee in 1921 steps were taken to make this committee still more repre sentative and useful it was planned to have this national agency serve not only as a source of encouragement to the childrens code movement but also as a 155THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY clearing house for information about this movement and about the activities of all private societies public depart ments and bureaus that take any part in itin a word to correlate the efforts of those who are seeking correlation Finally in the second year of our participation in the World War a campaign was carried on under the leadership of the Childrens Bureau of the Federal Government for the pur pose of wakening in the people of this country a fuller sense of their responsi bility to all children and a broader ap preciation of child welfare work This was known as Childrens Year and as a fitting climax there was drawn up at a conference in Washington in 1919 a set of recommendations applying to several fields of child care in accordance with the announced purpose of agreeing upon certain irreducible minimum standards for the health education and work of the American child It is interesting to note that this was done just a decade after the White House Conference and in the same city its agenda however covered a wider area moreover the Washington conference of 1909 was national while that of 1919 was international guests being present from several foreign countries upon the invitation of our government In this international conference we have a vivid illustration of the spread of the child welfare appeal and a formal acknowledgment of its universality The organization of the Congreso Americano del Niiio by LatinAmerican social workers in Buenos Aires in 1916 as a common meetingground for child welfare workers from the three Ameri cas and from the islands of the sea is further proof of the broad community of interest in aU that relates to the well being of children A few years ago this first part of the childrens code movement the declar ing of principles and the framing of standards was centered in the agita tion for what was called at the time a Childrens Charter This was in a way an effort to coordinate and foster the different manifestations of good will toward children that had grown out of the general interest in their wel fare although it had also as one of its purposes as its name implies a state ment of the rights of children a formu lating of the principles that lay at the bottom of all these manifestations So although this proposed charter had in it something of the nature of each of the two parts of the childrens code movement namely standards and statutes it was primarily a seeking after bases of action a quest for fundamentals It was hoped to get clearly in mind just what were the rights of childhood and then to ad vance from the expression of these rights to a series of legislative pro posals designed to secure them and to promote cooperation in their en forcement The matter was discussed at meetings of the National Conference of Charities and Correction and of the National Child Labor Committee but the charter as originally planned was never drawn up However the report of the Childrens Bureau Conference held in Washington in 1919 entitled Standards of Child Welfare is in reality a charter of childhood it is an outgrowth of the earlier effort and is well adapted so far as it goes to serve the ends of the former plan THE LEGISLATIVE WORK The writing of standards into the law is the more palpable part of the chil drens code movement and as a matter of fact is usually regarded as its only part for it is the obvious function of a childrens code to lay down the law on child welfare But this is really the crystallization of a process that has ex tended over a long period of time and 156THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHILDRENS CODE involves all the experience of the race As attention has been drawn more and more publicly in recent years to the needs of children a demand for more simplified laws and more effective procedure has arisen and out of this demand has grown the socalled chil drens code It may be said that it had its origin if anything so evolutionary can be con ceded a definite origin in England Three acts of Parliament known as the Consolidated Factory Acts the Con solidated Educational Acts and the Childrens Act of 1908 together with the amendments that have been adopt ed from time to time especially the Fisher Act adopted toward the end of the World War form what is practically a childhoods charter in the United Kingdom The subject matter of the first and second of this group of acts is indicated by their titles The third is wider in scope and is divided into six parts devoted to 1 infant life protec tion 2 prevention of cruelty to chil dren and young persons 3 the use of tobacco 4 reformatory and industrial schools 5 juvenile offenders 6 mis cellaneous matters such as definitions safety at entertainments penalties for giving intoxicating liquor to children etc The Childrens Act of 1908 at the time of its passage was popularly called the Childrens Charter although not so comprehensive as the term would lead one to suppose It immediately at tracted the attention of social workers in the United States who pointed out the more or less chaotic condition of our own child welfare laws and sug gested that action be taken by the several states looking toward the simplifying standardizing and co ordinating of their provisions some what after the manner of the British plan Ohio was the first to respond In 1911 her legislature directed the gov ernor to appoint a commission to revise consolidate and suggest amend ments to the statute laws of the state of Ohio which pertain to children and defined the powers and duties of this commission in part as follows In performing this duty such commis sioners shall unify the present laws pertain ing to illegitimate defective neglected dependent and delinquent children and to their treatment care maintenance custody control protection and reformation and shall suggest such amendments and addi tions as to them may seem best calculated to bring the law of this State into harmony with the best thought on this subject The commission labored at its task for nearly two years and submitted to the governor and through him to the legislature in 1913 a thorough going report with recommendations for laws on state control of charities juvenile courts institutions placing out compulsory education child labor apprenticeship offenses against chil dren and mothers pensions These recommendations were introduced into the legislature in the form of a single bill and with some changes were adopted that year New Hampshires legislature next took action by authorizing the governor and council in 1913 to appoint three suitable persons who shall investigate all matters relating to the welfare of the dependent defective and delinquent children of the State especially the questions of orphanage juvenile courts detention homes desertion physical and mental degeneracy infant mortal ity accidents and diseases and make report with recommendations con cerning the above matters to the legis lature of 1915 The commission was appointed and a careful report duly prepared and submitted but its recom mendations failed of adoption Upon the suggestion of social work ers and without authorization by the 157THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY legislature the governor of Missouri created a commission and charged it with preparing for consideration such changes in the laws concerning children as seemed advisable Accordingly fortytwo bills were drawn covering fairly all phases of child welfare but only ten were enacted here too the measures were introduced as separate bills instead of in a body as was done in Ohio The expenses incurred by the commission in the discharge of its duties were met by contributions from private sources for of course no public funds had been made available through appropriation by the legislature as had been the case in Ohio and New Hamp shire The proposals having been in large part rejected by the legislature in 1917 the governor ordered the com mission to continue its work and a new and more detailed report was prepared by its thirty members and submitted in 1919 together with bills to revise in consistent or conflicting statutes to repeal obsolete or undesirable provi sions and to provide in some instances entirely new legislation At this ses sion the report fared better and most of the recommendations were adopted In 1916 also upon the request of welfare workers and without warrant of the legislature attempts to obtain its authorization having failed the gov ernor of Minnesota inspired by the example of Missouris chief executive appointed twelve persons to revise and codify the laws of the State relat ing to children The commission had only five months in which to work be fore the convening of the legislature and therefore did not try to cover the entire body of laws pertaining to chil dren but gave its attention chiefly to the interests of the handicapped In this case also expenses were provided for through the generosity of public spirited citizens and societies The re port when submitted was referred to a joint committee of the two houses of the legislature and the secretary of the commission was appointed to serve as its clerk Thirtysix of the forty three bills that had been prepared were favorably reported to the legislature by its joint committee and were passed with but slight alterations and with scarcely a dissenting voice PRINCIPLES OF THE CHILDRENS CODE These states were the pioneers in the childrens code movement in this country and many others are following their lead and reorganizing their child welfare work But the term child welfare has become more or less technical and among social workers nowadays it is applied to the care of the child handicapped by poverty neglect delinquency or defect In defining the powers and duties of childrens code commissions governors and legislatures have apparently had this common limitation in mind and the commissions have generally restricted their work ac cordingly However a childrens code should be as comprehensive as its name it should not be devoted to the interests of any one class alone the normal child the ordinary everyday wholesome boy or girl should be its beneficiary as well as the abnormal or subnormal child who is in need of special care The real childrens code is democratic and recognizes no class distinctions It should include meas ures for the preservation of life and health for education for recreation and for the rights of parent and child as well as for protection from want abuse and crime Health education recreation and employment concern all children and moreover most boys and girls are not dependent destitute neglected abused delinquent or de fective but are normal in respect to their home life their behavior their condition of body and mind and their 158A STATE PROGRAM FOR CHILD WELFARE relations to society The four es sentials to wholesome development health play schooling and suitable work since they are necessary to all classes of children the fortunate as well as the unfortunate should have their place in every childrens code The title of this article implies that childrens codes grow and the implica tion is true indeed it is this character istic of growth that holds out the prom ise of social wellbeing The task of adjusting laws to conditions is continu ous because conditions are always changing A childrens code must be from time to time renewed for each rewriting of it is but a step in the evolu tion of child care a clearing of the way for further progress It should be thought of as a living thing capable of endless development A fixed and final code would be a disaster but hap pily it is an impossibility for in the natural course of events it must yield to change Conditions and ideals are the stuff of which it is made up and condi tions and ideals are not stable things Thus while a childrens code seeks to equalize opportunities for children by making toward uniformity of condi tions it must itself submit to being moulded and remoulded as time goes on and must always encourage ex perimental work by whatever agency may be willing to undertake it for it is only by means of fresh enterprises and trial of new methods that our systems of law and administrative effort can be kept adequate under the ever changing circumstances of our life A childrens code is more than a code A code is an orderly compilation of laws a mere laborsaving device while a childrens code is constructive social service A code is a collection of the laws as they are achildrens code is a changing of the laws to what they ought to be A childrens code does not even bring together into one body the various laws of a state relating to children but leaves them scattered among the general acts as determined by their content it does not aim at mechanical perfection but at the nur ture of boys and girls The word code in this connection is really a misnomer and charter signifying as it does the bestowal of rights and privileges would perhaps be better but code is shorter and hence pre ferred So it is that this movement by what ever name it may be called tries to make childhood safe to give opportu nity to those who otherwise would not enjoy it and to provide training and play for all If it lengthens childhood for all children it will have accomplished its purpose for childhood as we like to think of it means happiness and if this be prolonged by any act of ours we shall leave to our children and to our childrens children an inheritance that naught else earthly can surpass A State Program for Child Welfare By WILLIAM HODSON LLB Director Childrens Bureau State Board of Control Minnesota IN 1915 Mr C C Carstens Chair man of the Childrens Committee of the National Conference of Social Work or Charities and Correction as it was then called presented a report to the Conference on A Commu nity Plan in Childrens Work This report attempted to set forth in a concrete manner not only the com munity responsibility for certain 159

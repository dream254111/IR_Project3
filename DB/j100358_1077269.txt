J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1077269,FROM WILLIAM SLOANE,I244616,THE SCHOOL REVIEW AND SOCIAL STANDING DEMAND BUT WHEN A MAN HAS REACHED THE GOAL OF HIS DESIRES WHEN HE HAS MADE HIS PILE AND WANTS TO ENJOY IT THEN COMES THE TIME FOR THE MAKING OF THE REAL AND ONLY BALANCE SHEET THEN HE MUST ASK HIMSELF WHAT ARE MY RESOURCES NOW THAT I HAVE EVERYTHING THAT MONEY CAN BUY WHAT ARE MY SPIRITUAL AND INTELLECTUAL ASSETS HOW CAN I BEST SPEND WHAT IS LEFT TO ME OF LIFE LUCKY IS THE MAN WHOSE EARLY TRAINING FITS HIM FOR SOMETHING MORE THAN THE GOLFFIELD OR THE TENNISCOURT AND FOR SOMETHING BETTER THAN THE GAMINGTABLE WHEN HIS DAYS OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY ARE OVER HE CAN TASTE THE GENTLER PLEASURES THAT AWAIT HIM IN HIS STUDY AND BY THE BLAZING HEARTHFIRE HIS SOPHOCLES OR HIS HORACE OR HIS CATULLUS WILL MAKE THE WINTER OF LIFE SEEM LIKE ITS EARLY SPRING WHEN THE GREATEST STRUGGLE HE KNEW WAS WITH THE ELUSIVE RULES OF GRAMMAR AND SYNTAX THIS BUSY WORLD OF OURS CANNOT STOP IT WILL ALWAYS WHIRL AND RUSH AND HUSTLE BUT SOME OF USAND THE MORE THE BETTERMUST LEARN THAT ON ONE SIDE OF THE RUSHING STREAM OF LIFE LIE THE PEACEFUL BACKWATERS IN WHICH THE CLOUDS AND THE SUN THE SHRUBS AND THE BIRDS OF THE AIR APPEAR REFLECTED IN THEIR TRUE UNDISTORTED IMAGE GENTLY FLOATING IN THE LIMPID POOL OF REVERIE 3 FROM WILLIAM SLOANE PRESIDENT OF W AND J SLOANE NEW YORK AN EDUCATION IS A LARGE ASSET FOR ANY MAN WHATEVER HIS CALLING HIS EQUIPMENT FOR A LIFEWORK IS THAT MUCH BETTER AND I FOR ONE THINK THAT AN EDUCATION AND PREFERABLY A CLASSICAL EDUCATION IS A DISTINCT ADVANTAGE TO A BUSINESS MAN AND WILL PROVE TO BE SO IN INCREASING MEASURE AS HE RISES TO POSITIONS OF RESPONSIBILITY AND INFLUENCE IN HIS BUSINESS OR ELSEWHERE A WIDER HORIZON MEANS GREATER ABILITY TO SEE THROUGH COMPLEX SITUATIONS TO UNDERSTAND MOTIVES TO MEASURE MEN TO SAY NOTHING OF THE MORE INTELLIGENT INTEREST IN THOSE OUTSIDE MATTERS WHICH INCREASE GENERAL CULTURE IN THE COMMUNITY IN THE STATE AND IN THE NATION AN AMERICAN MAN OF AFFAIRS IS HARDLY IN THE SAME CATEGORY WITH THE OLDWORLD SHOPKEEPER HE MUST BE WELL PREPARED TO SERVE HIS DAY AND GENERATION IN A GREAT VARIETY OF WAYS HE MAY BE CALLED FROM THE COUNTER TO THE CABINET THE ONLY LIMITATIONS TO SUCCESS IN AMERICA ARE THOSE OF CAPACITY BUT THE GREAT TROUBLE WITH US IS THAT WE ARE FOREVER LOOKING FOR THE SHORT CUT THIS CHARACTERISTIC HAS CAUSED A LACK OF THOROUGHNESS IN OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE IF A MAN CAN SKIM OVER HISTORY AND ECONOMICS AND A MODERN LANGUAGE OR TWO AND SECURE A COLLEGE DEGREE HE IS ILL PREPARED TO PERFORM THE DRUDGERY OF AN APPRENTICESHIP IN BUSINESS WHICH AFTER ALL CONSTITUTES THE ONLY BASIS ON WHICH TO BUILD I BELIEVE THAT THE SLOW PROCESSES OF TRANSLATION OF THE CLASSICS WHICH IN MY OPINION SHOULD BE COMPULSORY IN THE ACADEMIC COURSE FOR A BA DEGREE MAKE GOOD TRAINING FOR THE BOY WHO HAS CHOSEN A BUSINESS CAREER THIS IS 374CLASSICAL STUDIES FOR MEN OF AFFAIRS ENTIRELY ASIDE FROM THE ADVANTAGE WHICH HE WILL NEVER ENJOY AGAIN OF COMMUNING WITH THE GODS THE BUSINESS MANS DAY IS PROSAIC THE MEN HE MEETS ARE AS A RULE MEN OF LITTLE OR NO SCHOOLING THE BUSINESS PRIN CIPLES HE FINDS ARE NOT ALWAYS IN ACCORD WITH HIS PRECONCEIVED IDEAS OF HONESTY THERE ISNT MUCH ART OR POETRY IN IT ALL AND UNLESS HE HAS SOME THING TO FALL BACK UPON SOME BACKGROUND TO HIS LIFE AND THOUGHT SOME SUCH CONTINUAL SOURCE OF QUIET COMFORT AND PLEASURE AS A CLASSICAL EDUCATION WILL AFFORD HIM LIFE WILL BE A VERY EMPTY THING WHILE BUSINESS CARES AND BUSINESS SUCCESSES WILL BECOME SUCH PARAMOUNT ISSUES WITH HIM THAT THE MAN WILL BE LOST IN HIS PURSUITS AGAIN A BUSINESS MAN WHO HAS HAD A CLASSICAL EDUCATION CANNOT FAIL TO REMEMBER WITH REVERENCE AND AFFECTION THOSE PATIENT CONSECRATED MEN WHO TAUGHT HIM LATIN AND GREEK AND AWOKE IN HIM A LOVE FOR THE BEAUTIFUL SUCH MEN AS THESE WITH IDEALS HE PERHAPS NO LONGER MEETS IN HIS DAILY VOCATION WITH THE PASSING YEARS HE MAY HAVE FORGOTTEN THE VERY NAMES OF THE CLASSICS HE READ AT COLLEGE BUT THE MEMORY OF THOSE DAYS OF THOSE MEN OF THEIR ENTHUSIASM IN THEIR WORK HAS HAD ITS EFFECT ON THE MAN HIM SELF AND HE IS BETTER FOR IT AND I BELIEVE A BETTER BUSINESS MAN TOO FOR UNCONSCIOUSLY HE HAS ACQUIRED SOMETHING WHICH HE VALUES AS A PRECIOUS POSSESSION A SOMETHING WHICH DISTINGUISHES HIM FROM HIS FELLOWS AND MAKES HIM SINGULARLY HAPPY IN HIS WORK II THE STUDY OF THE CLASSICS AS A TRAINING FOR MEN OF AFFAIRS THE HON JOHN W FOSTER WASHINGTON D C MY EXPERIENCE IN THE PRACTICE OF LAW AND MY OBSERVATION OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS HAVE LED ME TO LOOK WITH REGRET UPON THE DIMINISH ING INTEREST IN OUR HIGHER INSTITUTIONS OF LEARNING IN THE STUDY OF THE ANCIENT CLASSICS THE MODERN UNIVERSITY SPIRIT SEEMS TO TEND TO THE ELECTIVE SYSTEM AND TO STUDY IN THE SCIENTIFIC AND MORE PRACTICAL DEPARTMENTS OF KNOWLEDGE I DOUBT VERY MUCH WHETHER IT IS WISEST TO LEAVE ENTIRELY TO THE IMMATURE YOUTH THE SELECTION OF HIS COURSE OF STUDY SO ALSO IT MAY BE BETTER TO TRAIN AND DEVELOP THE MIND IN THE EARLIER YEARS THAN TO STORE IT WITH KNOWL EDGE WHICH MAY WELL COME LATER IF THE UNIVERSITY IS TO MAIN TAIN ITS PROPER PLACE AS THE SEAT OF HIGHER LEARNING GREEK AND LATIN SHOULD NOT BE RELEGATED TO AN UNIMPORTANT POSITION IN THE CURRICULUM NOR THEIR STUDY DISCOURAGED 1 READ BY PRESIDENT JAMES B ANGELL 375

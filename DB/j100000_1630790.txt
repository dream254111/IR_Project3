Purehase Exposition rom September 19 to 25 of the present year The purpose and plan of the Gongress are thus deseribed The idea of the tongress grows out o the thought that the subdivision and mVltipli eation of spetialties in stienee has reathed a stage at whith investigators and seholars may derive both inspiration and profit from a general survey of the various fields of learning planned with a view of bring ing the seattered stienees into eloser mu tual relations The eentral purpose is the unifieation of knowledge an effort toward whith seems appropriate on an oGeasion when the nations bring together an exhibit o their arts and industries An assem blage is therefore to be tonvened at whith leading representatives of theoretital and applied scienees shall set orth those gen eral printiples and fundamental coneep tions whith tonneet groups of stiences re view the historital development of special seienees show their mutual relations artd distuss their present problems The speakers to treat the various themes are seleeted in advanee from the DEJuropean and Ameritan tontinents The distussions will be arranged on the following general plan After the opening of the congress on Monday afternoon September 19 will fol low on Tuesday forenoon addresses on     n   n mam c blvlSlons ot selenGe ans  ltS appS lca tions the general theme being the unilSela tion of each of the fields treated These SCIENCE NS VoLXX No497 rill be followed by two addresses on each of the twentyfour great departments of knowledge The theme of one address in eaeh ease will be the fundamental eoneep tions and methods while the other will set forth the progress during the last eentury The preeeding addresses will be delivered by Ameritans making the work of the first two days the tontribution of American eholars On the third dayn with the opening of the seetions the international work will begin About 128 seetional meetings will be held on the four remaining days of the eongress at eath of whith two papers will be read the ffieme of one being suggested by the relations of the speeial braneh treated to other branches the other by its present problems Three hours will be devoted to each seetional meeting thus enabling eaeh hearer to attend eight sueh meetings if he so desires The program is so arranged that related subjeets will be treated as far as possible at diSerent times The length of the principal addresses being limited to fortyfive minutes eaeh there will reluain at least one hour for five or six brief tommunitations in eaGh seetion The addresses in eaeh department will be tol leeted abnd published in a spetial volume It is hoped that the living influenee of this meeting will be yet more important than the formal addressesn and that the scholars whose names are announeed in the following program of speakers and chair men will form only a nucleus for the gath ering of thousands who eel in sylYlpathy with the eforts to bring unity into the world of knowledge The organization of the congress con sists of Director of CongessesHoward J Rogers ildqnz4stratave BoardNicholas Murlsay But ler president of Columbia IJniversity chairman WVilliam

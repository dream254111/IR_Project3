J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107983,ON THE EXTENSIVE ATMOSPHERE OF MARS,I206988,E 15  II ON THE EXTENSIVE ATMOSPHERE OF MARS IN A LETTER TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE DUKE OF SUSSEX KG PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY BY SIR JAMRS SOUTH FRS READ DECEMBER 13 1832 THROUGH THE KINDNESS OF YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS I HAD SOME TIME SINCE THE HONOUR OF CALLING THE ATTENTION OF ASTRONOMERS TO THE C EXTENSIVE ATMO SPHERE OF MARSTO THE OBSERVATIONS OF THOSE GREAT MEN FROM WHICH ITS EX ISTENCE WAS INFERREDAND I SHOWED THAT THEY WERE EITHER UNSUPPORTED BY OR WERE AT VARIANCE WITH MY OWN STILL HOWEVER AS THE OBSERVATIONS OF WHICH MINE SEEMED SUBVERSIVE WERE BEQUEATHED US BY ASTRONOMERS TO WHOM ASTRO NOMY OWES DEEP AND LASTING OBLIGATIONS RESPECT DUE TO THEIR MEMORY DE MANDED THAT I SHOULD RATHER ENFORCE THE NECESSITY OF FURTHER OBSERVATIONS THAN TREAT THE MATTER AS ACTUALLY DECIDED THIS NIGHT HAS PUT ME IN POSSESSION OF FRESH EVIDENCE AND I LOSE NO TIME IN FORWARDING IT TO YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS IN THE HOPE THAT IT MAY HAVE THE HONOUR SHOULD YOU AS PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY THINK IT WORTHY OF BEING PRE SENTED BY YOU FOR INSERTION IN THOSE JOURNALS WHICH CONTAIN SO RICH A MINE OF ASTRONOMICAL TRUTHS DURING TWILIGHT IN THE FIELD OF THE LARGE EQUATORIAL I SAW A STAR OF THE  THIS INSTRUMENT THE DESIGN AND WORK OF MESSRS TROUGHTON AND SIMMS WAS EXECUTED BY THEM IN PREFERENCE TO THE ONE HINTED AT BY ME IN A NOTE APPENDED TO PAGE 4 OF THE PHIL TRANS FOR 1826 IT WAS ERECTED IN MY OBSERVATORY IN THE EARLY PART OF THE LAST YEAR AND I FONDLY HOPED THAT LONG ERE NOW I SHOULD HAVE HAD THE GRATIFICATION OF PRESENTING AN ACCOUNT OF IT TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY TO MY INEXPRESSIBLE GRIEF HOWEVER OWING TO ITS UNFITNESS FOR THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH IT WAS DE SIGNED NOT ONLY HAVE FOURTEEN MONTHS OF A LIFE ADVANCED BEYOND ITS PRIME BEEN OF NECESSITY EMPLOYED OTHERWISE THAN IN PROSECUTING THOSE INQUIRIES FOR WHICH ALONE SUCH AN INSTRUMENT WAS WANTED BUT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT AS TO WHEN IT WILL BE FIT FOR USE I HAVE NOT DATA FOR OFFERING EVEN A CONJECTURE IN THE MEAN TIME FEARING LEST IT SHOULD ULTIMATELY PROVE A TOTAL FAILURE DURING THE LAST AUTUMN I VISITED THE IMPERIAL OBSERVATORY OF DORPAT AND I FEEL IT DUE TO THE MEMORY OF THE LATE MR FRAUN HOFER TO HAND DOWN AN APOLOGY THROUGH THE SAME CHANNEL WHICH CONVEYED THE INSINUATION CONTAINED IN THE NOTE BEFORE ALLUDED TO INASMUCH AS A FORTNIGHTS RESIDENCE UNDER THE ROOF OF OUR CELEBRATED16 SIR JAMES SOUTH ON THE EXTENSIVE ATMOSPHERE OF MARS EIGHTH OR SEVENTH MAGNITUDE SOUTH PRECEDING THE PLANET MARS ITS PLACE AP PROXIMNATELY TAKEN WITH THE FIVEFEET EQUATORIAL WAS RIGHT ASCENSION 3H 29M 19S AND ITS NORTHERN DECLINATION ABOUT 20 22 AS ADDITIONAL IDENTIFICATION IT WAS FOUND TO PRECEDE A STAR OF THE SEVENTH OR SIXTH MAGNITUDE ABOUT FIVE MINUTES TWENTYSIX SECONDS AND FIVE TENTHS AND WAS ABOUT ONE MINUTE AND FORTYEIGHT SECONDS OF A DEGREE SOUTH OF IT THESE PRELIMINARIES SETTLED THE NIGHT BECAME CLOUDY BUT AT ABOUT THREE HOURS AND A HALF SIDEREAL TIINE THE SKY BEING CLEAR ON DIRECTING THE INSTRUMENT TO MARS THE PLANET WAS SEEN SOMEWHAT MORE THAN HALF A MINUTE FROM THE STAR THE STAR AS PREVIOUSLY NOTICED WAS OF A LIGHT BLUE COLOUR AFFORDED A PLEASING CONTRAST WITH THAT OF THE PLANET AND WAS TOLE RABLY STEADY THE PLANETS LIMB EXTREMELY UNSTEADY THE OBJECTGLASS OF THE LARGE EQUATORIAL IS 11 85 INCHES IN ITS CLEAR APERTURE AND HAS NEARLY NINETEEN FEET FOCUS IT HAS TWO FINDERS THE ONE A TELESCOPE OF 440 INCHES APERTURE AND FIVE FEET FOCAL LENGTH THE OTHER 275 INCHES DIAMETER AND FORTYTWO INCHES FOCUS THEY ARE PLACED PARALLEL WITH THE TUBE OF THE LARGE OBJECTGLASS SO THAT THE SAME SIDEREAL OBJECT PRESENTS ITSELF IN THE CENTRE OF THE FIELDS OF THE THREE TELESCOPES AT THE SAME MOMENT THE OBJECTGLASSES OF ALL THE THREE ARE VERY PERFECT AND TAKING THEM IN THE ORDER OF THEIR DIAMETERS BEGINNING WITH THE LARGEST THEY WERE SUPPLIED WITH POWERS OF 520 250 AND 120 AND THAT THE OBSERVATIONS MIGHT NOT BE VITIATED BY THE UNSTEADINESS OF THE POLAR AXIS CYLINDERS OF WOOD WERE PLACED EAST AND WEST OF THE LARGE TELESCOPE SO THAT TOWARD THEIR UPPER EXTREMITIES THEY RESTED AGAINST THAT TELESCOPES TUBE WHILST THEIR LOWER ENDS WERE ON THE OBSERVATORY FLOOR THE FIVEFEET EQUATORIAL ALSO WAS PLACED UPON THE PLANET WITH A POWER OF 133 ONLY WITH THIS INSTRUMENT THE STAR WAS SEEN BY ONE OBSERVER TILL THE PLANETS LIMB HAD REACHED IT WITH THE LARGE FINDER OF THE LARGE EQUATORIAL ANOTHER OBSERVER SAW IT TILL A SMALL SEGMENT OF ITS DISK HAD BEEN CUT OFF BY THE PLANETS LIMB WHILST WITH THE SMALL ONE IT WAS DISTINGUISHABLE WHEN NOT MORE THAN THREE SECONDS OF A DE ASSOCIATE STRUVE HAS NOT ONLY DEMONSTRATED THAT FRAUNHOFER MUST EVER BE REGARDED AS AN OPTICIAN OF THE HIGHEST ORDER BUT THAT HE MERITS OUR PROFOUND RESPECT AS A MOST POWERFUL MECHANICIAN IN SHORT SUCH IS MY ADMIRATION OF I HAD ALMOST SAID VENERATION FOR THE DORPAT EQUATORIAL I SHALL TO THE LATEST HOUR OF MY LIFE REGRET THAT THE CONDITIONS ON WHICH THE GREAT MAN WHO MADE IT WOULD HAVE PROVIDED ME WITH ONE STILL MORE POWERFUL I WAS AS STATED IN THE NOTE IN QUESTION IMPRUDENT ENOUGH TO REJECT OBSERVATORY KENSINGTON MARCH 26 1833SIR JAMES SOUTH ON THE EXTENSIVE ATMOSPHERE OF MARS 17 GREE DISTANT FROM IT BUT ALTHOUGH THE PLANETS APPROACH TO THE STAR WAS OB SERVED WITH THE SEVERAL TELESCOPES IT IS TO THE LARGE EQUATORIAL ONLY THAT WE MUST REFER WITH THE REASONABLE HOPE OF DETECTING ANY MINUTE OPTICAL CHANGE WHICH THE STAR MIGHT APPARENTLY UNDERGO NO SUCH PHENOMENON HOWEVER OCCURRED FOR THE STAR RETAINED ITS LIGHT BLUE COLOUR AND COMPARATIVE STEADINESS TILL THE VERY INSTANT OF ITS OCCULTATION WHICH TOOK PLACE AT 41 32M 24S7 NOR DID ITS SPLENDOUR SUFFER ANY DIMINUTION PRIOR TO DISAPPEARANCE EXCEPT WHAT MAY FAIRLY BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE LIGHT OF THE PLANET I SAW NOT THE SLIGHTEST PROJECTION OF THE STAR UPON THE PLANETS DISK AGAIN AT THE EMERSION WHICH HAPPENED AT 4H 50M 41S7 THE STAR WITH THE LARGE EQUATORIAL TELESCOPE WAS SEEN NEATLY DICHOTOMISED  WITH THE LARGE FINDER IT WAS DETECTED BEFORE THE PLANETS DISK HAD SEPARATED FROM IT BY THE FIVE FEET EQUATORIAL WHEN IT WAS STILL CLINGING TO IT AND BY THE SMALL FINDER WHEN IT WAS NOT MORE THAN THREE SECONDS DISTANT WITH THE LARGE TELESCOPE IT WAS WATCHED WITH THE GREATEST ATTENTION AT AND FOR SOME TIME SUBSEQUENT TO THE EMERSION AND I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT NOT ANYTHING REMARKABLE OCCURRED ANY MORE THAN AT AND PREVIOUSLY TO THE IMMERSION THE PLANET HAD PASSED HIS OPPOSITION NINE DAYS REFLECTING ON THESE FACTS AND ON THOSE I HAVE BEFORE PRESENTED TO YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS I CAN ARRIVE AT NO OTHER CONCLUSION THAN THAT EITHER SOME PHYSICAL CHANGE HAS OCCURRED IN THE  EXTENSIVE ATMOSPHERE OF MARS OR THAT THE ACCU RACY OF THE OBSERVATIONS OF CASSINI AND OF ROEMER MUST BE REGARDED AS UN TENABLE OBSERVATORY KENSINGTON NOV 2 1832 MDDCCCXXXIII D

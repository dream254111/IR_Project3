j100276,Michigan Law Review,1272354,Restriction upon the Right of a Carrier to Deal in Commodities Transported by It,i254421,NOTE AND COMMENT RESTRICTION UPON THE RIGHT OF A CARRIER TO DEAL IN COMMODITIES TRANSPORTED BY ITNo decision of recent years by the Supreme Court of the United States is likely to have more far reaching effect than the case of The Interstate Commerce Commission v The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Company et al 26 Sup Ct Rep 272 the opinion in which by MR JUSTICE WHITE was filed February I9 I906 Briefly stated and omitting reference to some side issues which had no bearing upon the great principles involved the proceeding was brought by the Interstate Commerce Commission to challenge the right of an interstate carrier to sell and deliver commodities at a price less than the actualcost of the commodities plus the published freight rates therefor and the other costs incident to the execution of the contract This challenge was based upon the proposition that such contracts by a carrier to sell and deliver must result in discrimination against all other dealers in the commodity and so are violative of the InterState Com merce Act On behalf of the defendant companies it was contended that the contract in question was entered into in good faith and was supported in part by the waiver by the vendee company of a valid claim for damages for the breach of a prior contract between the same companies thus making the total consideration more than sufficient to cover the cost of the com modity the schedule freight rates and other charges As the prior contract relied upon was for the doing of the very thing complained of in the present proceeding the Supreme Court disposed of it in deciding the prin cipal question here in issue The Chesapeake and Ohio also claimed the right to buy and sell coal and to impute any loss on the sale of the coal to itself as a dealer instead of to itself as a carrier As is well known the decision was adverse to the companies and the dual contracts to sell and carry were declared invalid as violative of express and implied prohibitions of the InterState Commerce Act Unless greatly restricted by future adju dications the consequences of this decision are certain to be momentous but the precise questions decided and the propositions of law actually announced have been misunderstood and their extent greatly exaggerated in popular discussion and even by many journals of standing MR JUSTICE WHITE very clearly stated the limits of the inquiry presented and the answer thereto made by the court in the following language The case therefore will be considered solely in the light of the operation and effect of the provisions of the act to regulate commerce and we shall not direct our attention to expressly determining whether the assertion by a carrier of a right to deal in the products which it transports would not be so repugnant to the general duty resting on the carrier as to cause the exertion of the power to deal in the products which it transports to be unlawful irrespective of statutory restrictions The question therefore to be decided is this Has a carrier engaged in interstate commerce the power to contract to sell and transport in completion of the contract the commodity sold when the price stipulated in the contract does not pay the cost of purchase the cost of delivery and the published freight rates It will be seen that in denying the existence of such power to the interstate carrier the court has not decided that such a carrier may never without express legislative author 471MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW ity deal in the commodities which it carries That is to say this decision would not seem to prohibit dealing by the carrier in commodities transported by it if the sale price were demonstrably adequate to cover at least the fair market price thereof plus the schedule freight rates It must be conceded however that if the power to deal at all in such commodities be admitted to exist in the interstate carrier the latter by the aid of juggling book accounts is made master of a weapon which will render the administration of the InterState Commerce Act with reference to the precise restriction upon the carriers right here decided extremely difficult This is pointed out very clearly by the court in a passage in which it quotes from the English case of The Attorney General v The Great Northern Rail way Company 29 Law Journal N S Equity 794 in which it was decided that the act of Parliament granting the charter to operate the railway implied a prohibition against the companys engaging in any other business It must be conceded too that the practical effect of this decision if strictly adhered to and enforced will be to render it impossible under many condi tions for interstate railways to deal in commodities But as MR JUSTICE WHITE says Because no express prohibition against a carrier who engages in interstate commerce becoming a dealer in commodities moving in such commerce is found in the act it does not follow that the provisions which are expressed in that act should not be applied and be given their lawful effect Even therefore if the result of applying the prohibitions as we have interpreted them will be practically to render it difficult if not impossible for a carrier to deal in commodities this affords no ground for relieving us of the plain duty of enforcing the provisions of the statute as they exist The opinion is a clear bold and logical discussion of the subject it is stated in broad and sweeping language cites few cases and fortunately is concurred in by a unanimous court It may not seem presumptuous to say that it seems worthy of the best traditions of the great tribunal from which it emanated H M B

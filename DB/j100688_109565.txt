J100688,ABSTRACTS OF THE PAPERS PRINTED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,109565,AN ACCOUNT OF SOME STONES SAID TO HAVE FALLEN ON THE EARTH IN FRANCE AND OF A LUMP OF NATIVE IRON SAID TO HAVE FALLEN IN INDIA ABSTRACT,I207043,109 ACTUALLY INVERTED IN ORDER TO SUIT THIS STRUCTURE OF THE EYE THE HUMOURS OF THE EYES OF BIRDS ARE CHEMICALLY OF TILE SAME NATURE AS THOSE OF QUADRUPEDS IT IS ALSO OBSERVED THAT THE CRYSTALLINE IN ALL ANIMALS IS NOT THROUGH OUT OF THE SAME DENSITY THE RESULT OF SOME EXPERIMENTS MADE ON THIS SUBJECT BEING THAT ITS DENSITY INCREASES FROM THE CIRCUMFERENCE TO THE CENTRE AS THE SQUARE ROOTS OF THE QUANTITIES PARED AWAY FROM THE EXTERNAL PART LASTLY IT IS SUGGESTED THAT SINCE WE KNOW THAT ALBUMEN CAN BE COAGULATED BY VARIOUS METHODS IT IS NOT UNLIKELY THAT THIS MAY HAP PEN LIKEWISE IN THE HUMAN EYE AND BE THE CAUSE OF DISORDER KNOWN BY THE NAME OF CATARACT AN ATTENTION TO THIS COMPLAINT ESPECIALLY IN GOUTY PERSONS IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED AS SOME IMPORTANT CON CLUSIONS IT IS THOUGHT MAY BE DRAWN AS TO THE INFLUENCE OF PHOSPHORIC ACID IN CAUSING THAT DISORDER BY THE COMMON EFFECT OF ACIDS IN COA GULATING ALBUMEN AN ACCOUNT OF SOME STONES SAID TO HAVE FALLEN ON THE EARTH IN FRANCE AND OF A LUMP OF NATIVE IRON SAID TO HAVE FALLEN IN INDIA BY THE RIGHT HON CHARLES GREVILLE FRS READ JANUARY 27 1803 PHIL TRANS 1803 P 200 MR GREVILLE CONCEIVING THAT THE EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS MADE BY MR HOWARD ON CERTAIN METALLINE SUBSTANCES SAID TO HAVE FALLEN ON THE EARTH AND THE ACCURATE DESCRIPTIONS WHICH COUNT DE BOURNON HAS GIVEN OF THESE SUBSTANCES HAVE ESTABLISHED THE FACT THAT A NUMBER OF STONES ASSERTED TO HAVE FALLEN UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUM STANCES HAVE PRECISELY THE SAME CHARACTER IS HERE PLEASED TO COMMU NICATE TO THE SOCIETY THREE MORE INSTANCES OF SUCH SINGULAR PRODUCTIONS OF NATURE WHICH HAVE OF LATE BEEN NOTICED IN FRANCE THE FIRST IS A SPECIMEN BROKEN FROM A STONE OF ABOUT 15 INCHES DIAMETER PRESERVED IN THE MUSEUM OF BOURDEAUX AND WHICH IS SAID TO HAVE FALLEN NEAR ROQUEFORD IN THE LANDES ON THE 20TH OF AUGUST 1789 DURING THE EXPLOSION OF A METEOR IT BROKE THROUGH THE ROOF OF A COTTAGE AND KILLED A HERDSMAN AND SOME CATTLE THE SECOND IS PART OF A STONE PRESERVED IN THE COLLECTION OF MONS ST AMAND WHICH WAS ONE OF THE NUMBERS THAT FELL IN THE YEAR 1790 IN THREE DIFFERENT PARISHES IN ARMAGNAC SOME OF WHICH WEIGHED NO LESS THAN 25 POUNDS THE FACT OF THIS SHOWER OF STONES WAS AT THE TIME VERIFIED BY THE MAYOR OF ARMILE AND IS PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL DES SCIENCES UTILES DE MONTPELLIER FOR THAT YEAR FOR THE THIRD SPE CIMEN MR GREVILLE IS INDEBTED TO THE MARQUIS DE DREE IT IS A FRAG MENT BROKEN FROM A STONE OF 22 POUNDS WEIGHT WHICH FELL NEAR VILLE FRANCHE IN BURGUNDY THE 12TH OF MARCH 1798 THIS LIKE THE FORMER ONES WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A METEOR AND ALL THREE HAVE PRE CISELY THE SAME CHARACTER TEXTURE AND APPEARANCE WE ARE INDEBTED TO MR GREVILLE FOR A NEW EVIDENCE AND HE SAYS THE ONLY ONE HE HAS YET MET WITH THAT SEEMS TO ASCERTAIN THE ORIGIN OF NATIVE IRON WHICH FROM ANALYSIS HAD BEEN SUSPECTED TO HAVE A110 COMYMON ORIGIN WITH THE STONES FALLEN ON THE EARTH THIS HE OBTAINED FROM COLONEL KIRKPATRICK AND IT CONSISTS OF A TRANSLATION FROM THE PERSIAN MADE BY THE COLONEL OF A PASSAGE IN THE MEMOIRS OF THE EMPEROR JEHANGIRE WRITTEN BY HIMSELF THE SUBSTANCE OF THIS EX TRACT IS AS FOLLOWS IN THE FIRST YEAR OF THIS EMPERORS REIGN A 1030 OF THE HEGIRA THERE AROSE ONE MORNING IN A VILLAGE ABOUT 100 MILES EAST OF LAHORE SUCH A ITREMENDOUS NOISE AS HAD NEAR DEPRIVED THE IN HABITANTS OF THEIR SENSE OF HEARING DURING THIS NOISE A LUMINOUS BODY WAS OBSERVED TO FALL FROM ABOVE ON THE EARTH SUGGESTING TO THE BEHOLDERS THE IDEA THAT THE FIRMAMENT WAS POURING FIRE IN A SHORT TIME THE NOISE HAVING SUBSIDED AND THE INHABITANTS HAVING RECOVERED FROM THEIR ALARM A MESSENGER WAS DISPATCHED BY THEM TO THE AUMIL OR FISCAL SUPERINTENDANT OF THE DISTRICT TO APPRISE HIM OF THE EVENT THIS MAGISTRATE IMMEDIATELY REPAIRED TO THLE SPOT AND THERE PERCEIVED THAT THE EARTH TO AN EXTENT OF ABOUT TEN OR TWELVE YARDS IN DIAMETER WAS BURNT TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT NOT A BLADE OF GRASS NOR THE LEAST TRACE OF VERDURE REMAINED NOR HAD THE HEAT WHICH HAD BEEN COMMUNICATED TO IT AS YET SUBSIDED THE AUMIL HEREUPON CAUSED THE AFORESAID SPACE OF GROUND TO BE DUG UP THE DEEPER THEY WENT THE GREATER WAS THE HEAT FOUND TO BE AT LENGTH A LUMP OF IRON MADE ITS APPEARANCE THE HEAT OF WHICH WAS SO GREAT THAT ONE MIGHT HAVE SUPPOSED IT TO HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM A FURNACE AFTER SOME TIME IT BECAME COLD WHEN THE AUMIL CONVEYED IT TO HIS OWN HABITATION FROM WHENCE HE DISPATCHED IT TO COURT HERE THE EMPEROR SAYS I HAD IT WEIGHED IN MY PRESENCE AND FOUND ITS WEIGHT TO FALL LITTLE SHORT OF 80 OUNCES I COMMITTED IT TO A SKILFUL ARTIST WITH ORDERS TO MAKE IT INTO A SABRE A KNIFE AND A DAGGER BUT THE WORKMAN SOON REPORTED TO ME THAT THE SUBSTANCE WOULD NOT BEAR THE HAMMER BUT SHIVERED INTO PIECES WHEN STRUCK UPON THIS I ORDERED IT TO BE MIXED WITH OTHER IRON ACCORDINGLY THREE PARTS OF THIS IRON OF LIGHTNING AS WE CALLED IT WERE MIXED WITH ONE PART OF COMMON IRON AND FROM THIS MIXTURE WERE MADE TWO SABRES ONE KNIFE AND ONE DAGGER BY THE ADDITION OF THE COMMON IRON THE NEW SUBSTANCE ACQUIRED A FINE TEMPER THE BLADES FABRICATED FROM IT PROVING AS ELASTIC AS THE MOST PERFECT THAT CAN BE MADE IN OUR COUNTRY I HAD THEM TRIED IN MY PRESENCE AND FOUND THAT THEY CUT ADMIRABLY ONE OF THE SABRES I CALLED KATAI OR THE CUTTER AND THE OTHER BUSKSERISHT OR THE LIGHTNINGNATURED IN A TETRASTICH PRESENTED TO THE EMPEROR ON THIS OCCASION IT IS AS SERTED THAT IN HIS TIME FELL RAW IRON FROM LIGHTNING COLONEL KIRK PATRICK CERTIFIES THE GENUINENESS OF THE MANUSCRIPT AND THE FIDELITY OF THE TRANSLATION AND MR GREVILLE ADDS THAT HE CONSIDERS THIS AS AN AUTHENTIC FACT THE EMPEROR JEHANGIRE NOT BEING A PRINCE ON WHOM HIS COURTIERS WOULD IDLY VENTURE TO IMPOSE OR TO WHOM AN AUMIL OF A DISTRICT WOULD HAVE DARED TO PRODUCE A SUBSTANCE PRETENDING IT TO BE IRON WHICH ON TRIAL SHOULD BE FOUND TO DIFFER FROM MANUFACTURED IRON

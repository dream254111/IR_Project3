named that he could distinguish only the colors of blue and yellow in the solar spectrum Dr Mitchell tells of an officer who chose a blue coat and a red waistcoat believing them to be of the same color of a tailor who mended a black garment with a crimson patch and put a red collar on a blue coat Such mistakes seem quite as ridiculous to me as to others Yellow and black I have never confounded with other colors There is such a diversity in colorblindness that it seems im possible to determine the cause I am convinced that it is a physical defect The eye as a mechanical instrument has not been found at fault The cause is undoubtedly due to some peculiarity of cerebral formation Like the cause of lefthanded ness which is due to unusual development of the right brain color blindness is due to a freak of nature The education of the colorsense among the children of the primary schools has proved of great value in removing that uncer tainty in distinguishing colors which of course may be found among most ignorant people old or young This has its parallel in the education of the ear to the appreciation of all the variations of the musical scale But for one who is really colorblind education can be of little avail in correcting the defect W B HARLOW Syracuse NY Jan 27 A New TextBook on Zoology THERE can be no better evidence of the growing interest on the part of certain readingclasses of all ages and the importance that is being daily attached to biological studies by school authorities and educators than the everincreasing demand for good textbooks in zoology and the frequency with which such volumes put in an ap pearance We now have before us a thoroughly revised edition of Steeles Fourteen Weeks in Zoology New York Barnes  a little work that held its place with great popularity for ten years and which has now been almost entirely rewritten by Prof J W P Jenks of Brown University who is quite responsible for its present form From the author of the work I learn that the volume in scope is principally designed for beginners in our high schools and acade mies at the average age of fifteen to eighteen years in which schools they have no special means for illustration Moreover to be effi cient as a textbook it is intended to be used only by a class of teachers who presumably possess quite a thorough knowledge of general zoology drawing dissecting zoological aids and appli ances and kindred subjects Taken as a whole were this volume placed in the hands of such a teacher and its chief aim to be to impart a notion of general zoology to a class of students of the average age mentioned after faithfully following out its chapters for three or four months we must believe that no better work has yet appeared having a higher claim to such an end Its pages are crowded with beautiful cuts of the forms used in illustration of its text which cuts and illustrations have been for the most part ad mirably chosen and notwithstanding its unavoidable brevity the subjectmatter as a rule is presented in a manner calculated to in terest and instruct the student at every step It seems to me how ever that even in a work of this character its author should add a page to his preface and explicitly state in words and figures and acknowledge to whom he is indebted for his illustrations We find here numerous drawings of birds taken from Audubon and Wilson and many others without a word of such acknowledgment and the oversight occurs throughout the work We must believe that even young academical students should be taught that this is not the proper custom but where an author meets with such material assistance it should be duly noted An excellent feature of the work consists in properly dividing and accenting the technical names to assist in their pronunciation while on the other hand a serious defect is evidenced in the absence of a  glossary of terms  at the end of the volume In the main the classification adopted shows the impress of re cent views in the premises but here as much as anywhere else it needs the explanation of a skilled teacher as the student would gain but a very erroneous idea of the subject from this work alone as no family nor generic lines are drawn Take for example the VOL XI No 261 order Passeres where lyrebirds birdsofparadise finches crows and larks follow each other in the order I have given them with out a single word of explanation as to their affinities Then again we find the author at total variance with the leading authorities in placing the bats in the order Insectivora without a word as to why such a step should be taken Nor will he meet with full support in his order Bzimana containing only  one genus and a single species and that species having  the rank of a being who is alone declared to have been created in the image of God p 277 We have no scientific proof for this latter view Beneath about half the figures we find given in parentheses each ones proportionate size as compared with the living subject we regret that this excel lent idea was not carried out through the entire work and it will be well for future textbooks in zoology to adopt this plan Writ ten as the author of this work declares it is for a class of students as late as eighteen years of age to my mind it exhibits another thoroughly fatal omission for it has not a word to say of that great universal law pervading all nature and the world which explains the very origin of organic forms and the relations of the living ones to those now extinct Should a young man of eighteen years of age complete the course pointed out by this work and yet be igno rant of the law of evolution I hold his zoological studies have been but poorly grounded A companion work to the one under consideration on physics would be in the same case had it omitted the law of gravitation The object of a textbook in zoology for a class of students from fifteen to eighteen years of age should not have as its aim the en deavor to teach the greatest number of names of animate objects for at the present day that is a hopeless task even were it a desir able end It should on the other hand undertake to make clear the general principles of biological classification it should by a careful detailed study of a few types both vertebrate and inverte brate clearly point out the universality of morphological laws then these two lessons should be combined next it should be clearly shown the relation between living and extinct types and finally by a few clear examples show the origin of certain forms as the birds from reptiles and the ancestry of the horse and so on all of which is far more comprehensible than a jumble of isolated facts uncon nected by any known law Such a course properly expanded and illustrated by a competent teacher will give a student at once a more intelligent appreciation of life and living forms make him a better observer create in his mind a more healthy interest in the subject and finally send him forth with a kind of stimulation and systematized knowledge which fits him to further pursue biological research should it happen in any given case to be imparted to the mind of a student cast in the biological mould R W SHUFELDT Fort Wingate N Mex Jan 9 The Flight of Birds IT is with great diffidence that I take part in a discussion partici pated in by such eminent authorities as Professor Newberry and Professor Trowbridge and it is with still more hesitation that I ven ture to disagree with any opinions brought forward by either of these gentlemen Nevertheless I can but feel that undue stress has been laid upon certain facts while others of equal importance have been overlooked or incorrectly stated To a great extent the discussion hinges on the assumption that birds need some mechanical device to relieve the muscles of strain while soaring  an assumption whose truth seems open to ques tion as many of the lower animals are capable of automatic mus cular movements of very long duration Among mammals the cetaceans are almost constantly on the move both by day and by night while others rest in positions that seem to entail considerable muscular strain Thus horses very frequently sleep in a standing posture and the skunk and baboon have been observed to seek repose lying flat upon their backs with all four legs stiffly extended in the air a very good example of unrelieved muscular strain may be seen in the tail of the spider monkey whose prehensile power is sufficient to sustain the animal after life is extinct some birds during their migrations fly or swim for immense distances without stopping for rest and there is very good reason for believing that many of the petrels keep on the

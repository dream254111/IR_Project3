first meeting of the Council will be at noon on Saturday August 22d and the first general meeting will be on Monday August 24th The work of the ses sions has been made continuous not being in terrupted by Sunday or by a day for excursions The affiliated societies however meet on the 21st and the 22d and all who are able should be present at Buffalo on those days PROF HUBERT A NEWTON of Yale Uni versity died in New Haven on the night of August 12th We hope to give in a future number some details regarding Prof New tons life and his important contributions to astronomy and mathematics Yale University and American science have recently suffered most severe losses in the deaths of Professors Whitney Dana Eaton and Newton ADVICES by cablegram regarding the eclipse expeditions state that Prof Schaeberle and Prof Todd in northern Japan were unsuccessful or only partially successful in their observations but that the weather was clear and fine in Nor way CABLEGRAMS to the daily papers report that Dr Nansen has arrived at Vardo Island Nor way on board the steamer Windward which recently went to Franz Josef Land in order to bring back the JacksonHarmsworth expedi tion It is stated that with Lieutenant Hansen he left the steamer Fram in which he had hoped to be carried to the pole in March 1895 in Lat 84 Long 1027 to explore north of the LN S VOL IV No 86 Franz Josef route The party journeyed through an unknown polar sea and explored north of Franz Josef Land to Lat 8614 No land was seen to the north of Lat 82 only ice They wintered on Franz Josef Land living on whale meat and bear meat The Fram was reported to be a good ice ship and will arrive later this year There was no sickness on board Al though the expedition failed to reach the object of its search it got four degrees farther north than did any previous expedition THE second International Congress of Applied Chemistry was opened at the Sorbonne Paris on July 27th about 1600 delegates being present The admirable address of the Presi dent M Berthelot is published in the Revue Scientifique of August 1 THE sixtyfourth annual meeting of the Brit ish Medical Association was opened at Carlisle on Tuesday July 28th under the Presidency of Dr Henry Barnes physician to the Cumber land Infirmary As compared with the meet ing in London last year the attendance was not large about 700 members being present but the addresses by the Presidents of the sections and the proceedings of the sections contain much that is of interest not only to the medical profession but also to those engaged in advanc ing medicine as a science Following the British Association for the Advancement of Science the Medical Association will meet next year in Canada having accepted the invitation of the Montreal branch Prof T G Roderick pro fessor of surgery in McGill University will be President The Association will probably meet in Edinburgh in 1898 THE sixtyeighth meeting of the German naturalists and physicians will be held at Frankfort from the 21st to the 26th of Septem ber under the Presidency of Prof H von Ziems sen Lectures before the general sessions will be given by Drs Hans Buchner Richard Lep sius

and E von Bergmann American men of science will be welcomed at the meeting Membership cards can be obSCIENCE tained from the Secretary Dr Hugo Metzler Frankfort on payment of M 15 SECTION C Chemistry of the A A A S has printed in advance a provisional program which shows that as usual the papers presented before this section will be numerous and important Physical inorganic and organic chemistry will be taken up on August 25th didactic analyt ical and technical chemistry on August 26th technical and sanitary chemistry on August 27th agricultural and biological chemistry on August 28th More than sixty papers have been already promised THE admirable leadership of the department of natural science instruction of the National Edu cational Association is shown by the addresses given before the recent meeting and published in this JOURNAL We learn from the President Prof Charles S Palmer of the University of Colorado that it is proposed to secure a com mittee at the approaching meeting of the Amer ican Association for the Advancement of Science and also from the several college associations which will cooperate with the committee from the National Educational Association in discuss ing the position of natural science in the schools and the establishment of natural science re quirements for admission to college IT seems probable that owing to contrary winds M Andree has not undertaken to launch his balloon Reports that the balloon has been seen in the Arctic regions are not likely to be very reliable as the natives have been prom ised rewards for bringing news of the explorers HERR OTTO LILLIENTHAL while experiment ing with his flying mechanism on August 11th met with an accident which resulted in his death It is reported by cablegram that he started from a hilltop at Rhinow near Berlin and after floating for some distance the appara tus got out of order causing him to fall to the ground Herr Lillienthal was 46 years of age A PARTY under the charge of Mr W G Miller of the School of Mining Kingston Ont will leave that place on September 1st to explore the chief mineral localities of the Kingston district Though primarily intended for students of the school we understand that others would be admitted to the party Travel 223 ling will be done by canoes and it is estimated that the expense of the trip will not exceed 20 for three weeks ON the afternoon of July 26th there was a heavy hail storm in Paris which did great harm to the conservatories trees and plants of the Jardin des Plantes M MilneEdwards has re ported to the Paris Academy

He will explore the high mountain flora of Issikul giving particular attention to the mosses THE London Times states that Captain H H P Deasy has left England for a journey across Tibet from west to east He intends on the way to throw away solderedup tins containing parchment notices in English and French into the tributaries of the Tsanpo and into the other large rivers which he may meet with in the hope that some of them may be picked up far down stream possibly in the Brahmaputra Salween and Mekong and thus help to solve the vexed problem of the origin and connections of these rivers The notices will be consecu tively numbered and the tins in which they will be enclosed will have a brass label soldered on the outside bearing the words Please open this in English and French and Captain Deasys name The parchment inside bears the request that it be forwarded without delay to the Royal Geographical Society London with as accurate a statement as possible as to where it was picked up ON the occasion of Prof Bastians seventieth birthday which occurred on the 28th of June his bust in marble was given to the Museum of Ethnology in Berlin A Festschrift containing papers by 32 leading German anthropologists was also presented to him Prof Bastin is as we have recently stated now absent on an expedition through Central Asia PROF VICTOR HORSLEY has been presented on the occasion of his retirement from the chair of pathology University College London with a testimonial including an album which con tains photographs of fiftyone of the subscri AUGUST 21 1896224 SCIENCE bers to the testimonial together with a record of the work which each of them has done either in conjunction with Prof Horsley or in the Brown Institute and in the Pathological Department of University College

being conducted by Prof Clark State Geologist GEORGE WHITEFIELD SAMSON D D LL D formerly President of Columbian University Washington died in New York city on August 8th aged 77 years THE deaths are announced of Prof August Kanitz Director of the Botanical Gardens at Klausenburg and of Prof F R Simony the Alpine explorer who died on July 20th at the age of 83 THE LeopolinischCarolinische Academie of Halle is about to publish Cuviers first compo sition which is on the edible crabs of the French coast and dates from the year 1788 The Academy has in its possession a number of let ters of Cuvier which it is also intended to pub lish THE Observatory of the School of Technol ogy at Karlsruhe will be removed to Heidel berg Its director Prof Valentiner has been made professor in the University of Heidel berg AN observatory for terrestrial magnetism has been established in connection with the astro nomical observatory in Munich and Dr Franz von Schwarz has been made director THE Vienna Academy of Science proposes as the subject of the Baumgartner Prize 5000 to be awarded in 1899  The extension of our knowledge of ultra violet rays WE learn from Natural Science that a new zoological garden has been opened at Konigs berg in Prussia under the directorship of Dr J Miiller formerly of the Garden in Berlin also that a State Entomological Experiment Station for which the money has been voted by both Chambers is to be built near Stock holm N S VOL IV No 86 THE first number of the twentysecond vol ume of the Botanical Gazette is published from the press of the University of Chicago and like the other journals of the University is ad mirably printed on fine paper with wide mar gins Profs George F Atkinson of Cornell University Volney H Spalding of the Uni versity of Michigan Roland Thaxter of Har vard and William Trelease of the Missouri Botanical Garden will hereafter act as associate editors PROF W NERNST of the University of Got tingen has become the scientific editor of the

subject by E E Guillaume also published by GauthierVillars has reached a second edi tion IT appears that a new and very objectionable manner of advertising has been devised in Great Britain In the bedrooms of some of the leading hotels not only toilet articles but also patent medicines are placed in the hopes that guests will use and pay for these THE Paris Municipal Council authorized on July 10th the establishment of stands for auto mobile cabs It is also considering the use of automobile omnibuses which if adopted will throw 27000 horses out of employment France seems to be distinctly in advance of England Germany or America in the use of horseless carriages THE volume of Biological Lectures of the Marine Biological Laboratory of Woods Holl for 1895 is announced by Ginn  Co as nearly ready The volume will contain the following lectures Infection and Intoxication Simon Flexner Immunity George M Sternberg  A Students Reminiscences of Huxley Henry Fairfield Osborn  Paleontology as a

Watase  Seg mentation of the Vertebrate Head William ASCIENCE Locy  Segmentation of the Head J S Kings ley Bibliography A Study of Resources Charles Sedgwick Minot  The Transformation of Sporophyllary to Vegetative Organs George F Atkinson WE learn from Nature that the observatory at Athens will hereafter publish a daily weather report containing twentyfive stations in Greece and about double that number of exterior sta tions The report is accompanied by two charts one showing the isobars and general meteorological conditions over a large part of Europe and one showing wind and tempera ture over Greece and adjacent islands THE New York Medical Record states that Rabies has broken out among the cows dogs sheep and hogs in Path Valley Centre County Pa and it is feared that the disease will be come general throughout the county ACCORDING to Natural Science a party of four under the direction of Mr T A Mobley will start from Lacomb Alberta to explore north ern Canada from Edmonton to the Arctic sea The trip is to occupy two years ACCORDING to Nature the Russian Geograph ical Society has awarded this year its Constan tine medal to M A Rykacheff for his work in the domain of physical geography Beginning in the year 1874 with a work on the distribution of atmospheric pressure in Russia he continued to publish a series of researches on the diurnal variations of pressure the prevailing windsof the Caspian and the White Seas the tides in the atmosphere the freezing and thawing of the Russian rivers the variations of the levels of rivers in Middle Russia in connection with variations in the amounts of rain and snow the diurnal variations of temperature over the tropical oceans etc The Count Liitke medal has been awarded to Admiral Makaroff for his work on the temperature and density of water in the northern Pacific based on the measure ments made in 188689 on board the Vityaz His maps of the distribution of surface temper ature in August and of temperature at a depth of 400 meters are especially worthy of notice The Prjevalsky prize was awarded to M Bere zovsky for his explorations of the northern borderlands of Tibet A Prjevalsky medal was 225 awarded to J A Schmidt for his twelve geodetical expeditions to different parts of Central Asia and Siberia and one to Dr H A Fritsche for his magnetic measurements in China Mongolia Siberia and Russia Two small gold medals were awarded to F F Muller for his magnetic work in East Siberia and to A A Lebedintseff for his researches into the chemical composition of water in the Black and Azov Seas Eighteen silver medals were awarded for various works of lesser im portance A PART of the collection of butterflies of the late Prof A M Butljero has been presented to the Academy of Sciences of the University of Moscow The collection of Mexican insects made by the late Julius Flohr has been be queathed by him to the Museum of Natural History Berlin the same institution will also receive in event of the death of Herr Hans Fruhstorcher his valuable collection of butter flies ACCORDING to the London Times some impor tant alterations are now being carried out at Kew Gardens The temperate house projected by the late Prince Consort was originally de signed to comprise a central structure two octagons and two wings The wings were not added but the government has now granted the necessary funds and already such progress has been made that the south wing is nearly completed and the north wing will be con structed at the earliest possible date When finished the temperate house will be one of the most striking and probably the largest of the kind in existence Its central avenue will be 600 ft long and there will be a clear view from end to end This it may be added will be just double the length of the present largest house the palm housein the gardens The build ing will be used especially for the accommoda tion of succulent plants agaves the taller cactuses and the like from such subtropical countries as the Cape the highlands of Mexico and the Canary Islands Limited in the area of their growth the plants have hitherto been necessarily confined in tubs but in their new quarters they will be planted out in beds where they may be expected to flower and add a new AUGUST 21 1896226 SCIENCE attraction to the Royal Gardens There has just been established near what is known as the rhododendron dell in the arboretum a small bamboo garden The species are mostly Japan ese Chinese and Himalayan and are probably the finest collection now in Great Britain The naturalized bamboos have already created a great deal of interest which may be followed by their more general cultivation Two inter esting official publications may also be men tionedone in course of being issued and the other projected by the staff at Kew The former is a complete list of the plants cultivated in the gardens which it is hoped will fix a standard nomenclature thus doing away with the confusion of identical plants known under two or more names The other book will be a guide to the economic plants and will include a summary of their qualities and uses THE London Times states that a Pasteur filter on a large scale has been exhibited by Messrs J Defries and Sons on their premises in Houns ditch It has been constructed by them for the municipal authorities of Darjiling with the sanction of the Indian government and will be sent out there immediately The filter con sists of a series of iron cells or circular ves sels each of which contains 250 Pasteur porce lain tubes These tubes resemble hollow can dles and stand upright in the floor of the cell The water filters through them from the out side to the inside under pressure or by grav ity and all impurities are arrested on the sur face of the porcelain which is formed of a special clay or mixture of clays The filter is cleaned periodically or as often as may be necessary by scraping off the deposit from the surface of the tubes and by passing through them dilute hydrochloric acid which dissolves and carries away the earthy salts deposited in the interstices of the porcelain The principal of this filter and its successful application to domestic purposes have been well known for several years and have gradually overcome the distrust with which sanitary science is inclined to regard all fillters Its efficiency seems to be well established not only by laboratory experi ments butfar more convincinglyby the prac tical results in the reduction of waterborne dis ease obtained by its use in the French army N S VOL IV No 86 The interest of the present exhibit lies in the size of the installation It consists of 38 cells and 9500 tubes which will deliver 150000 gal lons per day As we are going to press with the present number of SCIENCE we have received provi sional programs of the several sections of the approaching meeting of the American Associa tion for the advancement of science The num ber of papers entered at a date considerably in advance of the meeting is as follows Section A Mathematics and Astronomy 8 Section B Physics 19 Section C Chemistry 60 Section D Mechanical Science and Engineering 23 Section E Geology and Geography 17 Section F Zoology 17 Section G Botany 35 Section I Social and Economic Science 9 In each of the sections other papers will doubtless be offered which will be entered on the daily pro grams published during the meeting It is a great advantage to have the programs in ad vance of the meeting and we regret that it is now too late to print them in full in this issue of SCIENCE We hope to publish full reports of the sectional meetings but no one who is able to be present at Buffalo should neglect to attend a meeting which promises to be of especial inter est UNIVERSITY AND EDUCATIONAL NEWS THE HULL BIOLOGICAL LABORATORIES THE Chicago University Record gives an ac count of the exercises held on the occasion of the laying of the corner stone of the Hull Bio logical Laboratories on July 3d The address in the convocation tent was given by Prof G L Goodale of Harvard University who spoke on Some of the Relations of Natural History to Thought and Modern Life President Harper made a statement regarding the impor tance of Miss Culvers gift for the development of science in the course of which he made the following important announcement regarding the place of investigation in the medical school  In laying these corner stones today we are laying the foundations of a school of medicine for aside from the distinct work outlined in each department there is that great and important

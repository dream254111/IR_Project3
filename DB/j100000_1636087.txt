nestling upon an ore body of considerable size The value in bul lion of this aggregate was 640 and it prob ably was the largest mass of polybasite ever taken from a mine entire THE growth of the mineral industries of the United States is graphically exhibited by a chart just issued by the Geological Survey tabulating for each year of the last decade the quantity and value of the output of our metal lic and nonmetallic mineral products This chart shows that in 1898 the domestic produc tion of the metalspig iron silver gold cop per lead zinc quicksilver aluminum anti mony nickel and platinumhad a total value of 305482183 in the same year the total value of the other mineral products amounted to 418790671 the grand total for the coun try in 1898 was therefore 724272854 Ten years later at the close of the calendar year 1907 the value of the metals had increased to 903024005 that of the other products to 1166265191 and the grand total was 2 069289196 The chart has interest in con nection with a summary of the mineral pro duction of the country published by the survey as an advance chapter from Mineral Re sources of the United States Calendar Year 1907 and copies of both the chart and the summary may be obtained by applying to the director of the survey at Washington D C The survey has also published for free dis tribution separate chapters of its annual report on the mineral resources of the country giving detailed statistics of many of the products that make up these totals Nature states that the council of the Ront gen Society has decided to act upon the advice of the committee appointed in 1906 to con sider the possibility of preparing a standard for the measurement of radioactivity This committee recommends that  The aray ion ization from I mg of pure radium be regarded as a standard and called a unit of radio activity The council has deputed Mr C E S Phillips to prepare a set of three substan dards of RaBr2 and these are now maturing By the cooperation of Professor E Ruther ford comparison will be made with a speci men of the purest RaBr2 at the Victoria Uni versity Manchester The quantity of radium in other specimens will be capable of accurate measurement by comparison with the sub standards It is anticipated therefore that by this means the exact description of medical physical or other work with radium will be facilitated and that the possibility of fraud in the sale of expensive radium preparations will be eliminated The council proposes tot lend the substandards to any competent person desiring to measure the amount of radium in his possession or to arrange for authoritative tests to be made For further particulars application should be sent tc the honorary secretary of the R6ntgen Society at 20 Han over Square London W THE following as we learn from the British Medical Journal are among the prizes awarded by the Paris Academie de Medecine for 1908 The Laborde prize 200 for the most notable advancement of surgery has been given to Professor Monprofit of Angers for his work on the operative surgery of the stomach the Theodore Herpin prize 120 has been gained by Dr Albert Deschamps of Riom for an essay on the diseases of energygeneral as thenias the Amussat prize 40 has been awarded to Dr Destot of Lyons for a radio graphic and clinical study UNIVERSITY AND EDUCATIONAL NEWS IOWA COLLEGE has obtained an additional endowment of 500000 of which 100000 is from the general education board and 50000 from Mr Andrew Carnegie MR JOHN W GATES has given 100000 to establish a college at Port Arthur Texas MR JACOB H SCHIFF of New York City has given 100000 towards the construction of a Jewish institute of technology at Haife Palestine WE learn from the London Times that the foundcations of the laboratory which is beingE given to the University of Oxford for electrical work by the Drapers Company are now being constructed The laboratory will measure 106 SCIENCEJANuARY 15 1909 about 104 feet by 92 feet by 51 feet high and will be built of red brick and stone It will be situated in the Parks close to the other build ings devoted to science which are grouped around the museum The ground floor will contain a classroom 50 feet by 27 feet a workshop of about the same dimensions as well as research battery and dark rooms On the first floor provision is made for a lecture hall 36 feet square and two classrooms over 50 feet long while on the second floor there will be a classroom about 100 feet long be sides large lecture and research rooms THE President of the United States has in structed the Commissioner of Education to aid in all appropriate ways within his power in the carrying out of the plans of the Chin ese Government for the education of students in America The Chinese Government pur poses sending 100 students to America every year for four years and a minimum of 50 students every year thereafter during the period of the cancelled indemnity payments by China to the United States from 1909 to 1940 PROFESSOR DONALD J COWLING of Baker University Baldwin Kas was elected presi dent of Carleton College Northfield Minn to succeed the Rev R H Sallmon MR W H EMMONS of the U S Geological Survey is giving courses on petrography and economic geology at the University of Chi cago DR A J GROUT has been appointed first assistant in biology in the Curtis High School New Brighton Staten Island DR ARNOLD LANG of Zurich has declined the call to Jena as the successor of Professor Haeckel PROFESSOR PFLIGER of Breslau has been called to Berlin as director of the Institute of Hygiene in the place of Professor Rubner who has been transferred to the chair of physi ology DISCUSSION AND CORRESPONDENCE A DISCLAIMER HARDLY had the experimental researches at the Nutrition Laboratory of the Carnegie In stitution of Washington located in Boston been established when the scientific staff were besieged by innumerable newspaper reporters seeking information whereon they could base sensational articles for distribution in the public press Much to my regret a lengthy article was distributed broadcast throughout the American press on December 20 purport ing to describe the Nutrition Laboratory the experiments made therein and the plans for the future It is needless to say that the whole article was prepared without my knowl edge and has left an entirely erroneous im pression with regard to the work of this in stitution Briefly the researches now being carried out in Boston were instituted by Professor At water at Wesleyan University some fifteen years ago After Professor Atwaters un timely retirement I had charge of the re searches at Wesleyan University and since then they have been transferred to Boston to a special laboratory The apparatus used at Wesleyan University has been described in detail in Publication No 42 of the Carnegie Institution of Washington and a discussion of a series of experiments with it made on man during inanition was reported in Publication No 77 of the institution The forthcoming  Yearbook of the Carnegie Institution  con tains a short statement of the laboratory the plan and general information regarding it The newer calorimeters have not been de scribed as yet All results of experiments made in this laboratory will be published in regularly accredited scientific journals and in the reports published by the Carnegie Institu tion of Washington It has been my policy not to publish original scientific material in popular scientific or semiscientific magazines much less would I use the daily newspaper as a vehicle for presenting this material to the scientific public In connection with the last newspaper an nouncement regarding this laboratory there is a very unfortunate statement that as a result of experiments thus far made in the labora tory the treatment of diabetes would be ma terially modified and improved thus holding out hope to the large number afflicted with this SCIENCi 107

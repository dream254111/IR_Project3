bank was solvent and the transaction was executed in good faith A short time later the bank made an assignment for the benefit of creditors Held that the selling stockholder received in effect a portion of the banks capital that the purchase was to the prejudice of the banks creditors by diminishing their chances of collecting their claims and that holding the same as he did subject to the superior equities of the creditors the assignee could recover it for their benefit Fitzpatrick v McGregor I909  Ga  65 S E 859 FISH C J reviews many authorities and renders an opinion which is especially instructive on the right of a corporation to purchase its own stock In England it is uniformly held that a corporation cannot without express statutory permission purchase its own capital stock See the leading case of Trevor v Whitworth L  R12 App Cas 409 which reviews the English de cisions on this point In the United States most of the courts hold that such a purchase is not objectionable if the rights of the creditors are not impaired thereby See MICH L REV 407 where many cases on the English and Amer ican rules are cited The special capacity theory as to corporate powers would seem to make the purchase by a corporation of its own shares ultra vires unless such an act could be sustained as falling within one of the im plied corporate powers Save in a few exceptional cases it is difficult to see why such a power should be implied It is however quite properly implied when such a purchase is necessary to save a debt owing by the selling stock holder to a solvent corporation and it is uniformly so held Draper v Black well etc 138 Ala 182 the principal case and Chillicothe etc Bank v Fox 3 Blatchf 431 If the corporation was insolvent at the time of the purchase it is clearly an invalid transaction and will be set aside Alexander v Relfe 74 Mo 495 Currier v Lebanon Slate Co 56 N H 262 It seems that even in those states where the right of a corporation to purchase its stock is clearly established the corporate creditors who are injured thereby can have the purchase declared voidable in their behalf Clapp v Peterson I04 Ill 26 The Georgia court properly held that if the bank was in fact insolvent at the time of the purchase no amount of good faith would cut off the rights of the creditors and that the mere fact that the selling stockholder and the pres ident of the bank thought the bank solvent did not prevent the application of the rule that the capital stock of an insolvent corporation is as against the stockholders a trust fund for the benefit of creditors and could not be with drawn by a stockholder so as to divest the creditors of the right to it in satisfaction of their claims CORPORATIONSOWNERSHIP OF STOCKUNLAWFUI PLEDGERIGHTS OF PLEDGEEPlaintiff through her husband as agent deposited with a broker who was her husbands creditor certain stock certificates on the back of which there was a blank assignment reciting a transfer and a power of at torney and giving the right to sell transfer and assign to secure the debt of her husband Defendant bank accepted the stock so pledged as security for a loan to the broker in entire good faith and believing the broker to be the owner of the stock Plaintiff knew nothing of the pledge to the bank 240RECENT IMPORTANT DECISIONS The broker became insolvent and the defendant bank sold the stock and ap plied the proceeds of the sale to the payment of its claim Held that plain could recover the value of the stock from the defendant and was not estopped from asserting her claim Williams v Merchants National Bank of Baltimore Garnishee 1909 Md  72 Atl III4 The court held that such an assignment and such powers of attorney did not clothe the broker with the indicia of absolute ownership and that one accepting the stock from the broker was chargeable with notice of the rights of the real or original owner The decision is in accord with the other Maryland cases on the question Taliaferro v First National Bank 7I Md 200 17 Atl 1036 German Savings Bank v Renshaw 78 Md 475 28 Atl 28I In the latter case a distinction is made between a bona fide pledgee and a bona fide purchaser The latter it seems would get a good title even in Maryland The principal case is however opposed in its reasoning at least to a number of decisions in other states among them being the leading case of McNeil v Tenth National Bank 46 N Y 325 7 Am Rep 341 WILGUS CASES CORP 1674 Here under similar circumstances the court of appeals of New York held that the broker was clothed with the indicia of ownership and that his pledgee was as fully protected in his rights as if he had dealt with the absolute owner of the stock The question is one difficult to solve but it is believed that the McNeil case arrived at the most equitable solution of the problem It would seem that the real owner rather than the bona fide pledgee of the stock should bear the loss and this not on the ground that the certificates of stock are quasi negotiable but as a result of the application of the well settled principle that where one of two innocent parties must suffer as a result of the fraud of a third party the loss should fall upon him who enabled the third party to perpetrate the fraud It is the real owner who in these cases has enabled the broker to repledge the property as the brokers own and it would seem to be more in accord with justice to hold the original owner estopped from coming into court and denying that which he has to all except the fraudulent broker impliedly affirmed This rule would make the owners of stock more careful in selecting their brokers and pledgees For cases protecting the rights of the bona fide pledgee see in addition to the McNeil case Shattuck v American Cement Co 205 Pa 197 54 Atl 785 97 Am St Rep 735 Woods Appeal 92 Pa 377 Jarvis v Rog ers 13 Mass IO5 Westinghouse v German National Bank 196 Pa St 249

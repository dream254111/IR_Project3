some other Minerals By 11 C SORBY FRS and P J BUTLER Received December 8 1868 Plate VII For mnaniy years Mr Butler lhas had the opportuniity of examining very many rubies sapphires anid diamnonds and has taken advanitage of it in formirng a most itnterestiing collection cut and mounlted as mnicroscopical objects le had very carefully stuidied the included fluidcavities and ascertained many curious facts Mr Sorby had for some tirne paid much attention to the microscopical structure of crystals and published a paper in which he showed that their microscopical characters often serve to throw much light on the origirn of rocks Mr Butler therefore placed the whole of his collection in Mr Sorbys hands for careftul examination and it was decided that a paper should be written by the two conjointly and since Mr Sorby lhad previously made many experiments in conniexioii with the expansioni of liquids as already described in a paper publislhed in the Philosophical Magazinet he took advanitage of the opportunity to investi  Quarterly Journal of Geol Soc 1858 vol xiv p 453 t  On the Expanision of Water and Saline Solutions at High Temperatures August 1859 vol xviii p 81292 Alessrs Sorby ain1d Butler on the Structure of Feb 18 gate the law of the expansion of the very interesting fluid met with in the cavities of sapphire In describing the various facts it will be well to consider them in rela tion to the following general principles 1 The structure of the various minerals as mere nicroscopical objects 2 The physical characters of the fluidcavities as throwing light on the origin of the minerals 3 The influence of some inceluded crystals on the structure of the sur rounding mineral Sap phir es By far the most interesting objects contained in sapphires are the fluid cavities Their occasional pr esence has been already nloticed by Brewster  who met with one no less tbaii about 4 inch long twothirds full of a liquid which expanded so as to fill the whiole cavity when hleated to 820 F 28 C He thought the liquid was less nmobile than that described by himn in topaz and could not see a second liquid in the cavity Though many thousand sapphires have been examined by the authors no sulch large cavity has been found but several have been met with about l inch in diameter the greater number are far less ard some are very minute and they seem to contain only the liquid wlhich expands so much when warnmed The size of the included bubble varies muciih according to the temperature At the ordinary heat of a room it is sometimes equal to onehalf of the capacity of the cavity whereas in other cases the cavity is quite fill This is espe cially the case with the very small cavities and is to some extent due to the forced dilatation of the liquid But if we only take into corisideration the larger cavities the temperatture required to expai d the fluid so as to fill them certainly varies from 20 to 32 C8 68 to 900 F aid this not only in different crystals but also to a less extent in the same specimenl As illustrations of the form of such cavities we refer to Plate VII figs L1 2 3 and 4 the extent to which they are magnified being shown in each ease At the ordinary temperature the bubble in the cavity shown by fig I is about onehalf its diameter but disappears entirely at 30 C By carefully mea suring the size of tlhe cavity in various positions and comnparinig it with the diamneter of the bubble at 00 C it appears that the liquid expands from 100 to 152 when heated from 00 to 30 C Fig 2 is a tubular caviitv and shows in a very excellent manner the boillng of tlle liquid when it cools after having been maade to expand to fill the wlhole space At the ordinary temperatuire the liquid occupies only about half the cavity but when heated in a waterbath to 320 C it fills it entirely No bubble is formed until the temperature has fallen to 3 1 and then innumerable small buibbles are suddenly formed which rise to the upper part and unite but instead of the liquid merelv contracting by further coolinSg it still contirnues to boil for some time as represented in the drawing Two other large cavities 8 S6chtinis Einschliisse von Mineralien in krystallisirten Milneralien p 121 who re fers to Edin Journ of Sc voL vi p 1151869 Rubies Sapphires Diamnondzs and some other Minerals 293 containecl in the same specimen also behave in the same manner and becomie full and suddenly boil at almost absolutely the same temperature as that figured We lneed scarcely say that such cavities are extremely rare and are very remnarkable even when merely looked upon as microsco pical objects independently of their interest in coiinexion with phvsics Fig 3 is a tubular cavity of more irregular form and is interesting on ac count of there being two plates of the sapphire projectinog into the cavity so as to nearlydivide it into three portions At the ordinary temperature these partitions prevent the passage of the bubble frorn onie part to the other buit by breathing on the object through a flexible tube the slight increase of temperature expands the liquid so as to make the bubLble small enough to pass into the next compartment and a repetitioni of the process causes it to pass into that at the other end Suieh plates projecting into the cavities are very common and it is requisite to pay atterntion to this fact silnce otherwise they might easily be mistaken for crystals of some other substance included in the cavity which if they ever occur must be extremely rare since n1o decided case has comne under our niotice In examining sections of sapphire cut in a plane more or less parallel to the principal axis of the crystal the double refraction is so strong that two images of every object lying at anrv depth below the surface are seen in such a manner as to make them very confused This may be avoided by using polarized light without an anialyzer and arranging the planie of polarization so as to coincide with one of the axes of the crystal High powers may then be used with perfect definition  and they show maniy smiall cavities sometimes of most irreguilar forms like fig 4  anid very often their sides are so inclined that they totally reflect transmitcted liglht aci appear black anid opake In some specimens nmost of the cavities have lost their fluid Besides fluidcavities there are maniy small crystals of other mlilnerals inclukded in sapphires btlt not so many as in rubies The most striking are small platelike crystals often of trianguilar form with one angle very acute They are very thin and give the colouirs of thin plates so that when viewed by reflected light they lool something like the scales from a buitterfly Seen edgewise they appear as mnere black liines anlcd are ar rancged parallel to the three prinicipal planes of the sapphire as shown by fig 5 These snall crystals and the minute fluidcavities cause many sapphires to appear mnilky by reflectecl and somewhat browni by tranls mnitted light and beinig arranged in zones related to the form of the crys tal they often show as it were lines of growth Ru6bies Tlhough the ruby ancl the sapphire are of course essentially the same inineral yet their structure is in maniy respects as characteristically dif erent as their colour The numiiber of the fluidcavities in rubies is far less and the larger cavities are very rare and onily containi what appears to be water or a saline aqueotus solution as is shown by the amount of expansion when294 lMessrs Sorby and Butler on the Structure of Feb 18 the speciimen is heated to the temperature of boilinig water Those con taining a similar fluid to that included in sapphires do occasionally occur and when they are minute they are extremely initeresting since they show the spontaneous muovement of the bubbles to greater perfection than anyr mineral that has come under outr notice This is perhaps to some extent due to the nature of the liquid which is more mobile than the saline aqueous solutions contained in the cavities of the quartz of granite and syenite It is nmanifestly a miolecular movemient analogous to that seen in all matter when very mninute particles are suspended in a liquid so as to allow freedom of motion  and the rapidity of the movement is certainly dependent on the size of the particles It is not seen to advantage if the diameter of the bubbles is more than 1 I  of an inch but when it is about  they move to and fro in the imost surprising mnanner with such rapi dity that the eyre can scarcely follow themi The number of small crystals of other miinerals included in rubies is often verv great There must be at least four different kinds but it would be difficult to determine wnat minerals they all are Some are very well cha racterized octahedrons variously miodified  and as shown by fig 5 their planes are very generally arranged parallel to planes of the ruby anid to the small platelike crystals aIready menitioned in describing sapphire These octahecdrons have no influence on polarized light and in general form and character correspond so closely with spinel that it seems very probable that thev are that mnineral For some time we thoiught they were angular fluidcavities filled with liquid but when cut across in the sections they are clearly seen to be solid though less hard than ruby Many of the other included crystals are of such very rounded forms that if it were not for their action on polarized light they might easily be mistaken for cavi ties filled with soyne fluid Most of these rounded crystals are colourless but some are of more or less dark orangered colour and are certainly not the same mineral as the colourless or the octahedral crystals and in all proba bility the thin and flat are a fourth kind Occasionally alternating plates of ruby with their axes in different positions gave rise to a beautiful series of coloured stripes when examined with polarized light Spinel The ruby spinels from Ceyloni sornetimes contain fluidcavities which differ in a striking manner from those of any other mineral that has come under our notice One of these is shown in fig 7 They are to a great extent filled with a yellow substance indicated by the shading which seems to be either a solid or a very viscous liquid It incloses transparent sometimes welldefined cubic crystals which have no action on polarized light trans parent prismatic or platelike crystals which stronigly depolarize it  and black opake crystals either in larger pieces or mere grains The rest of the cavity is in each case about onethird full of a colourless liquid which seems to contract on the application of heat because it passes entirely into1869 Rubies Sapphires Diacmonids and somle otter IVlinerals 29 vapour as occurred in some of the cavities in topaz described by Brewster In this change it must expand about six hundred timnes less than when water passes into steam Spinel also incloses crystals of several other minerals which we have not yet been able to idenitify Alquamarina The most striking peculiarity of this mineral is the occulrrence of num bers of fluidcavities containing two fluids and a vacuity as shown by fig 6 Emerald Some of the specimens which we have examined are so full of fluid cavities that they are only partially transparent They differ enitirely from those already described and contain only one liquid which does not sensibly expand when warmed In all probability this is a strong saline aqueous solution since the cavities also inclose cubic crystals as shown by fig 8 which dissolve on the application of heat and recrystallize on cooling Oni the whole therefore these cavities are very similar to those found in the quartz of some granites and in some of the miinerals found in blocks ejected from Vesuviis as described in Mr Sorbys paper on the microscopical structure of crystals already referred to Diamond Few if any of the specimens of diamond that have come under our lnotice contain objects similar to thosewhich in the opinion of G6ppertx are evidence of its having beeln derived from vegetable remains but we have been able to study to great advantage some facts which do lnot appear to have presented themselves to either G6ppert or Brewster We have examined twentyone objects similar to the two described by Brewster in his paper in the Trans actions of the Geological Societyt and this has enabled us to clear up some of the difficulties to which he alludes and has led uls to propose a different explaniation He thought that the black specks which were surrounded by a black cross when examined with polarized light were minute cavities but at the same time he admitted that they were so small that it was not possible to say whether they contained a fluid or were empty Judging from what we have seen of such small examples we consider it impossible to say whether they are cavities or inclosed crystals but fortunately we have met with several of suclh a size and character that it was quite easy to see that they were crystals Fig 9 is a most excellenlt example of this fact The form is clearly that of a cry stal anid it depolarizes light very powerfully Its refractive power must be very much less than that of diaiimond for the inclined planes totally reflect the transmitted light and thus look quite black as shown in the figure It is this circumstance which causes many smaller inclosed crystals to appear like mere black specks  Ueber Einschuiisso im Diainant Natuurlkundige Verhandelingen Haarlem 1864 t 2nd series vol iii p 455296 Messrs Sorby and Butler on the Structure of Feb 18 Brewster has shown that the irregular depolarizing action of diamond is analogous to that of an irregularly hardened gum anid this much inter feres with the perfection of the black crosses seen round the inclosed crys tals and sometimes even neutralizes this action Still as a general rule a black cross iS seel  anid as described by Brewster when examined by means of a plate of selenite which gives the blue of the first order the tints of the sectors in the line of its principal axis are depressed in the same manner as when stuch a black cross is produced by the comrpression of glassthus proving that the inclosed crystals have exerted a pressure on the surrounding diamond We however do not imagine that the crystals have increased in size but that probably they have prevented the uniform contraction of the diamond which as already menitioned must have been very irregular even whlere no such impediment was present A few of the crystals inielosed in rubies give rise to similar black crosses as shown by fig 11 and we are informed by Professor Zirkel that his brotherin law Professor Vogelsang has prepared a tbin section of a specimen of partially devitrified glass which also shows black crosses roulnd the inclosed crystals Brewster suggested that this phenomenoon in diamond was due to the elastic force of an inclosed gas or liquid and compared it with what is seeni in the case of some cavities in amber We however find that the optical character of the crosses seen Xround the undoubted cavities in amber is the very reverse of that in the case of diamond and cannot be explained by the maee mechanical action ot an included elastic substance but is similar to the change to a crystalline state which has occurred over the whole external surface and on both sides of cracks passing from it inwards The optical properties howevei are not the only evidence of contraction round crystals inclosed ini diamond for actual cracks are often seen to pro ceed from them These present the striped appearance shown in fig 10 owing to imore or less perfect total reflection from their waved surface The same kind of phenomenon m ay be seen in sapphire aind still better in spinel as shown by figs 12 and 13 Sometimes there is a system of radia ting cracks nearly in one plane termiinating in a transverse crackv which surrounds the whole as in fig 12  and in other cases there are various complicated wavy cracks in different planes as in fig 13 There seemns to be some connexion between this structure and the nature of the in cluded minerals for round somne kinds it is very common but round others very rare or quite absent anad it appears probable that it inay be referred to unequal contraction in coolingo from a high temperature  and if so the results would necessarily depend on a variety of cireumstances Now that attention has been directed to it it will probably be founid to be a very common peculiarity of certain classes of minerals and serve to throw a good deal of liglht on their origin Crystals surrounded by radiatin0 crks on a much larger scale have18691 Rubies Sapphires Diamonds and some other Minerals 297 been observed by Mr David Forbes and may we think be explained in a similar manner The crystals formed in blowpipe beads kept hot for some time over the lamp also furniish good illustrations of these facts Phosphate of zirconia is deposited in cubes from a borax bead to which much microcosmic salt has been added and when examined with the mnicroscope whilst cooling cracks like those described in diamond and spinel are seen to be formed round mnany of the crystals which are evidently due to the crystals con tracting less than the suirrotuniding mlaterial On the contrary the long prisms of borate of baryta deposited fromi solution in borax are seen to separate from the borax on coolinig and to be filled with tranlsverse cracks like those in schorl inclosed in quartz which is clearly owino to their con tracting more than the borax Fluidcavities in general Before discussing the nature of fluidcavities in counexiou with the origin of the various minerals we thilnk it best to describe the remark able properties of the liquid included in the sapphire and to point out what it seems to be Brewster in his paper oni the fluiidcavities in topazM says that the more expanisible liquid contained in them expands onefourth its size when heated from 50 to 800 F or thirtyone and a quarter times as much as water and as already stated he found that the fluid in sapphire expands about onehalf when heated to 82 F Though this amnolunt of expansion is very remarkable yet when the relative expansion at various temperatures is examined it will be seen to be still more remarkable Tery fortunately the tubular cavity in sapphire slhown by fig 2 is nmost admirably titted for experiment Mere inspection shows that its general diameter is very uniform  and that it is really so can be proved by causing the liquid to pass from one end to the other for at 17 C the lenlgth of the column of liquid was 25 of an inch whether it was at the end A or B The total effective length of the c4avity is 45O The specimen ilCelOsing this cavity was fastened to a piece of glass and this was fixed in b bealker containing water supported so that the cavity was in the focus of the mieroscope under a low power The temperature was raised very slowly and was maintained for sonie miniutes at each parti cular degree at which it was thougllt desirable to measure the volumne of the liquid and this was usuially repeated over and over again when the heat was both rising and falling so as to obtain as accurate a result as possible In mdakin the measurevments with the inicrometer care was taken to allow for the tapering endds of the cavity aiid the curved surface of the liquid The results are given in degrees Centigrade Though the expansfon below 30 was very great compared with that of any other known substances except liquid carbonic acid and nitrous oxide when the  Ed Neiv Phil Jouint Suly 1857 ti Tramq Roy Soc Fcdin 1824 vol x p 1298 Messrs Sorby and Butler on thle Structure of Feb 18 temperature rose above 300 it was so very extraordinary that it was not until after having performed the experiment over and over again that Mr Sorby felt conifidenlce in the restults This will niot be thought surprising when we state that fiom 3 1 to 32 the apparent expansion of the liquid is io less than onefourth of the bulk it occupies at 31  the length of the column increasing for that single degree from 40 to 5 inch lhis is about 780 times as great as the expansion of water woulld be and even 69 times as much as that of air and permanent gases It was niot possible to ascertaini the amournt of expansion alove 32 C because the cavity was quite filled at that temperature If the expansion inclrease at the same increased rate the liquiid wouild soon occupy several times as much space but it seerns verv probable that before theni it would pass into the state of gas At all events it appears as if this enormous rate of expansion inidicated a close approach to a fresh physical cnidition The followingo Table gives the results of the experiments  and it has been found by drawing them as a curve that their general relationis indicate that there cannot be any serious error but at the same time considering all the circumstances they must only be looked uponi as tolerably good approximations to the truth Temperature Volume 0 01 C 100 172 k  109 20 113 25 122 28 130 29 139 30   150 31 174 32  217 The apparent expansion of the liquid is doubtless to somie extent in creased by the condenisation of the gas as the space occupied by it is diminished When in the highly expanded conldition this liquid appears to be remarkably elastic Berthelot has shown in his paper on forced dilatation  that the force with wlhich liquids adhere to the initer ior of a glass tube is sufficiernt to prevenit their contraction to the normal volume if they have been heated so as to expand and quite fill the tube anld theni cooled to a temperature below that requisite ti fill it This fact must always be borne in rninld in studying fluidcavities and explainls why the bubbles as it were hesitate to return aild then make their appearance with a suddenl start Sulch a forced dilatation is very remarkable in the case described for though it was requisite to raise the ternperature to 32 C to fill the cavity nio vacuity was formed uintil it fell to 310 aInd there fore it seems as if the force of cohesioni were sufficienlt to stretch it to considerably  Annales dle Chimnie s6r 3 t xxx p 2321869 Racbies Sapphires Diamonds atnd somze other Mllinerals 299 more thain its nlormal bulk even perhaps to the extent of oniefifth or onie fourth Moreover in the case showni in fig 1 the liquid expanded so as to fill the cavity at about 30 C  anid yet it can be heated up to 420 without bursting it though even if the expansion did niot continue to increase and were the samne for each degree as from 310 to 32 the normal volume would be about four times that of the cavitywhich in any case seems only to be explailned by supposing that its elasticity is most remark ably great more like that of a gas thani of a liquiid There was no decided evidence of its passing into a gaseouis state as does occur whenl cavities con tain a less amounit of liquid Simmler  has showni that the physical properties of the liquid in topaz as observed by Brewster agree more nearly with those of liquid carbonic acid than with those of any other known substance Dania in his  Minera logy 5th editioni 1868 p 761 calls it Brewsterlinite andsays that its composition is unknown The facts at Simmlers command were not in all respects satisfactorysince the amount of expansion given by Brewster was from 100 to 2607 C whereas that of liquid carbonic acid observed by Thilorier was fromi O to 30 and as showni above the expansion in creases so much as the temperature rises that the average rate for 1 is very indefinite rThe only reliable methocl is therefore to compare the ex pansion between equal degrees of temperature According to Thiloriert liquid carbonic acid whein heated from 00 to 30 expands from 100 to 14Z One of the experiments described above showed that the liqulid in sapphire expands from 100 to 152 and the other frorn 100 to 150 which is the most reliable This agrees so closely with the expansion of liquid carbonic acid that the difference might easily be due to a slight error in the ther mometers The expanisionl of ordinary liquids is not to be compared with it nor is that of liquid sulphurous acid Dr Franklanii lhas kindly ascer tained this fact with special reference to the case in question and found that from 00 to 32 C the expansion was only from 1 00 to 104 36 instead of to 217 According to Andreffe the expansion of liquid nitrous oxide is not much inferior to that of liquid carbonic acid beinig from 15 to 20 00872 for each degree which differs decidedly from that of the liquid in sapphires The occurrence of nitrous oxide in miinerals is also so verv much more im probable that oni the whole it seems as if we should be justified in con cludinig provisionally that it is liquid carbonic acid which like water should therefore be classed amongst natural liquid mineral substances Brewster has shown  that when cavities in topaz contain less than one third of their volume of the expansible liquid it does not expand when heated but passes entirely into the state of a compressed vapour Un Pogg Ainn vol cv p 460 T Gmnelins Hlandbook of Chemistry Cavendish Societys Tranislation vol i p 225  Liebigs Ann vol cx p 1  Trans Roy Soc Edin vol x

the volumne which must however lie between onehalf and onethird CagniardLatour  founid that when ether and other liquids sealed up in small strong tubes with a certain space left empty were heated they expanded very mnch and sud denly passed into the state of vapour The temperature pressure and vo lutme at which this change took place varied very considerably Ether ex panded to nearly double its volumrie and passed into vapour at about 2000 C with ani elastic force of 37 or 38 atmospheres Alcohol expainded to about three times its volume and passed into vapour at abotut 2600 C with an elastic force of 119 atmospheres whereas water appeared to expand to nearly four times its volume and required a temperature near that at which zinrc melts 3280 C Daniiel When in this highly expanided state the liquids were verv mnobile andcl seenmed muichl more compressible tllan under other circumstances for they did not burst the tube if too much had been sealed up in it until after their normal volume would have been decidedly greater than its capacity No one could fail to see that these phenomena have much in common with what occuirs at a lower temperature in the case of the liquLiid inclosed in sapphire and that they are of great importance in coninexion with the origin of fluidcavities Since they become full of liquicl at a comparatively low temperature it was not unreasonable to sup pose that the mninerals in which theey occur must have been formed where the heat was scarcely above that of the atmosphere  but these facts seem to show that the occurrence of such fluiidcavities is quite reconcilable with a very high temperature for it is obvious that if at a great depth below the surface heated highly compressed yaseous carbonic acid were inclosed in growing crvstals it might conidense on cooling so as to more or less com pletely fill the cavities with tlhe liquiid acid If the same principles could be applied li thie case of water we should be led to infer that it could not exist in a liquid state at a higher tempe rature than that of dull redness corresponding closely with what Mr Sorby deduced from the fluiclcavities in some volcanic rocks In that case ac cordling to CagniardLatour the liquid when condensed would occupy only onefourth part of the cavity and it would scarcely be likely to con tain any fixed salt in solutionl whereas the fluidcavities in the minerals of ejected blocks are often twothirds full of what seems to have been a supersaturated solution of alkaline chlorides The phenomena nlow under considerationi should certainly be borne in mind in studying volcanic action and it is possible that some cavities niow containing water may have been formecd by the inclosure of very highly comlpressed steam In some cases the requisite pressure wvould be enormous and other facts seem to show that it was more generally caught up in a liquid state The cavities in emerald are very interesting in connexion with this subject aiid also furnish strong evidence against the opinion that the liquid was not  Ann de Chimie 1822 t x pp 127  178 t xxii p 4101869 Rubies Sapphires Diamonds and some other Minerals 301 present wlhen the crystals were fornmed but penetrated into the fluidcavities at a subsequienit period ancl either filled vacant spaces or reMoved and re placed the material of glass cavities as suggested by Vogelsang  In the specimenis which we have examined each of the cavities contains what is no doubt an aqueous saline solution and as shown bhy fig 8 one or more cubic crystals probably chloride of potassium which dissolve on the appli cation of heat and are deposited again on cooling These cavities are thus analogous to those met with in the quartz of some gra nite and in the mi nerals of blocks ejected from Vesuvius and it seems difficult if not impos sible to explain them except by supposing that a strong saline solution was caught up by the mineral at the timne of its formation In some cases the amount of such saline matter is so great in comparison to the liquid that a high temperature would be requisite to make it all dissolve It also seems probable that if water could penetrate into suich crystals it would soon be lost when they were kept dry This certainly occurs in some soluble salts especially those containing combined water and in some minerals of loose texture but we have never seen evidence of it when fluidcavities are completely inclosed in hard and dense substances like quartz or emerald Thouglh in some instances the size of the bubbles does not bear a uniform relation to that of the cavities yet in imany cases the genieral proportion is very similar in each specimen anid the exceptions can easily be explained by supposing that occasionally small bubbles of gas were cauight up along with the water or that there was some variation in either temperature or pressure during the growth of the crystal all of which conditions were discussed in Mr Sorbys paper already referred to We have not had the opportunity of studyinig many examples of cavities which contain two fluids probably water and liquid carbonic acid and therefore forbear to say much about them According to Brewstert the temperature at which those in topaz become full corresponlds very closely with what we have observed in the case of sapphire so that the carbonic acid might have been inclosed either as a highly dilated liquid or as a highly compressed gas but since the otlher liquid has deposited crystals which dissolve on the applicationi of heat it seems most probable that the water was caught up in a liquid state sometimes perhaps holding a con siderable amounit of carbonic acid in solution as a gas On the whole therefore the various facts described in this paper seem to show that ruby sapphire spinel and emerald were formed at a moderately high temperature under so great a pressture that water mright be present in a liquid state The whole structure of diamond is so peculiar that it can scarcely be looked upon as positive evidence of a high temperature thougl not at all opposed to that supposition The absence of fluidcavities con taining water or a saliine

occurrence of fluidcavities containing what seems to be merely liquid carbonic acid is scarcely reconcilable with the presence of more than a very little water in either a liquid or gaseous form We mav here say that we do not agree witli those autlhors who mainitain that the curved or irregular form of the fluidcavities is proof of the minerals having been in a soft state since ana logous facts

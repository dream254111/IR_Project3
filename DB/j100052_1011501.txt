j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1011501,The Need for Agricultural Education,i242603,THE NEED FOR AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION BY DAVID Y THOMAS PHD University of Arkansas Fayetteville Ark While teaching in the University of Florida my attention was called to the need of certain lines of agricultural training in a very forcible manner It was there that I left the boarding house for a home and began to learn something of the problems which confront the housekeeper To my astonishment I found on looking over the grocers bill that we were paying forty cents a pound for butter Straightway there was an investigation When called upon the grocer brought out a neat little brick of butter and said Yes that is as cheap as we can sell Wisconsin butter Wisconsin butter  I gasped You do not mean to tell me that you are selling butter from Wisconsin Do not Florida people make butter By way of answer he brought out a pan of greasy stuff which he sold to some people under the name of butter at twenty cents Then I began to reflect a little There is a University of Wis consin Connected with this is an experiment station and an agri cultural department Certain men up there have interested them selves in securing a better breed of cattle and improving dairy methods A professor had actually invented a separator and a milk tester Results Butter Cheese

the total production of butter and cheese must be approaching 50oooo0000ooo pounds In one year Johanna just a cow produced 131862 pounds of milk which was turned into 55762 pounds of butter worth II949 and the skim milk left was worth 2IIO Deduct from this 4528 for her keep and you have a net profit of 913I That was pretty good but the I50The Need for Agricultural Education next year she leaped to nearly 27500 pounds of milk nearly eight een times her own weight Then there was Pedros Pandora which produced I329 pounds of butter fat in seven days Meantime shippers continue to buy up miserable scrubs from the Florida and Georgia crackers at I0 and 15 per head and ship them off to Cuba while tourists and native dwellers of the towns buy Wisconsin butter at forty cents If the crackers only knew Take the matter of corn Hog and hominy is a distinctly southern dish yet here are some comparative statistics of corn pro duction North Carolina I65 bushels per acre Pennsylvania 325 South Carolina I5I Michigan 30I Georgia I30 Wisconsin 320 Alabama I55 Minnesota 27 Mississippi I70 Kansas 221 Louisiana 175 North Daokta 20 Texas 21 South Dakota 255 Oklahoma 244 Colorado 235 Arkansas I72 New Mexico 29 Most of the states with the better yield probably are better adapted to corn but the yield in the South can be greatly improved Contrast with the above some experiment station and demonstra tion farm results In I908 the Georgia Experiment Station made tests with thirteen varieties of corn and secured an average yield of 305 bushels The highest yield was of the Marlboro Prolific 3959 bushels A demonstration farm in Mississippi sets 35 bushels over against the average of I7 one in Alabama 375 over against the average of I55 and one in Virginia 4375 over against the aver age of 25 and the experiment station in the same state ran the yield up to 75 In Illinois the experiment station has produced I00 bushels per acre and a boy in Arkansas has done the same winning the prize in the boys contest There is no mystery about itsimply intelligent selection and cultivation and economic fertilization Instead of sixty pounds of fertilizer the Georgia farmer will have to apply from 200 to 350 At the experiment station they applied 3539 pounds The direc tor of the station the Hon Martin V Calvin says It is not neces sary to issue a propaganda in favor of buying fertilizer in any cotton state    The necessity is to educate to induce to per suade the great mass of fertilizer purchasers to use material with an open hand intelligently For years the southern farmers have been told to plant less cotton and more corn It is unnecessary Nine cotton states now produce 56I103000 bushels to 402628000 by nine northern and i5iThe Annals of the American Academy western states But to do this the South took 30767o00 acres while the other nine took only I5564000 More fertilizer will help toward the 8oooo0ooo mark Testing seed is important The work of Professor Holden in adding millions to the wealth of Iowa through seed selection is a matter of common fame Out in Texas tests were made from seeds from the fields of several different farmers The best yielded twelve bushels more per acre than the average of the others Of the thirteen varieties tested in Georgia the Marlboro Prolific pro duced 3959 bushels while Rileys Improved produced only 2478 Many a farmers son knows all about the Duke of Marlborough and the battle of Blenheimthe daughters know about the present duchessbut never heard of Marlboros Prolific Many never heard of either If they only knew Tobacco is a distinctively southern crop In Virginia they raise 675 pounds to the acre in North Carolina 580 in Florida 875 in Kentucky the greatest tobacco state of all 870 The largest of the averages that of Florida is exactly half the average in Massachusetts the state of abandoned farms In New Hamp shire they raise I785 in Pennsylvania 1375 A great deal of the waste and deterioration in tobacco takes place after the crop is in the shed due to unscientific curing Ex periments with steam curing showed practically no loss Here as well as in corn the matter of seed is important Twothirds of the tobacco now grown in Wisconsin came from seed which resulted from experiments carried on at the Wisconsin Experiment Station The average planter does not know that the leaves should not be stripped from the seed stalks when the rest of his tobacco is cut Neither is he expert in selecting hardy plants from his plant bed But he could increase the yield and quality if he only knew Not so very long ago rice was supposed to be peculiar to the swamp lands of the Gulf Coast and the South Atlantic In 1903 the Arkansas Experiment Station began a series of experiments on rice In I9o8 Arkansas had about 28000 acres of rice with an aver age yield of forty bushels It is believed that the yield for I909 will exceed I750000 bushels and the cultivation has extended to Missouri The price received varies from o80 to ioo per bushel The experiment station has made one acre yield I00 bushels In Georgia they are experimenting now with upland rice Some day I52The Need for Agricultural Education rice may reduce the price of flour if we only knew enough about its cultivation In I894 my career as a school teacher began in the black belt of Alabama where cotton is king At that time this ruler was grind ing down his subjects with a heel shod with four and five cent cotton I longed to get away from the cotton belt where I would never again see a stalk of cotton nor hear the despairing wail of the planters Now we have changed all that and cotton is a beneficent ruler once moreonly his subjects are not yet sufficiently enlight ened in the matter of selection fertilization and cultivation to say nothing of care and marketing On some of the 40000 demonstration farms scattered from Virginia to Texas a number of tests have been made on cotton notably in Alabama Georgia and Mississippi A plant cultivated the old way grew fourteen inches high in a certain time and weighed three ounces They call this bumblebee cotton because a bee can stand on the ground and sip honey from the blossom By new methods of cultivation another stalk was raised to twentytwo inches in the same time and it weighed sixteen ounces Down in Alabama where the planter was averaging I69 pounds of lint cotton to the acre the demonstration farm got 428 In Mississippi the planter average of 228 pounds was raised to 445 by demonstration methods Mr Daniel J Sully knows a few things about cotton besides how to corner it In I906 when he visited North Carolina he was invited to inspect a field near Raleigh growing two and a half bales to the acre where previously only onehalf bale had been produced He could not believe it until he went out and saw for himself Scientific knowledge applied to farming did it If the farmers only knew In the summer of 1907 while passing through Van Buren Ark I counted near sundown twentysix farm wagons standing in line waiting for a chance to unload their burdens of Elberta peaches ready for shipment to northern and eastern markets Some of the peaches were beauties some were not The difference in most cases probably could be accounted for by the difference in the scien tific knowledge of the producers One man was reputed to have sold his crop on the trees at I25 per acre That same fall the banks of Fayetteville Ark did not curtail paymentsthat was the panic yearuntil forced to it by their correspondents The explanation i53The Annals of the Am4erican Academy is that their coffers had just been filled by a bumper apple crop If one passes the canning factories of Fayetteville now he will find that they are using many faulty apples In the window of a certain store a few days ago some fine apples were on display underneath which was this legend Fifteen acres sprayed and not a wormy apple in the lot There is a great deal in the proper spraying and fertilization of fruit if the fruit growers only knew But how shall they know except they hear and how shall they hear except they be taught and how shall they be taught unless schools be provided There are a few agricultural colleges but they hardly supply the demand for trained investigators and teachers As for the farmers they touch these only remotely except through short courses and extension work and this is only in its infancy The normal schools of Missouri were first in the field in training teachers of agriculture and probably are now the best in the country for that specific work The normal schools of Alabama Arkansas Georgia and South Carolina are taking up the same work But they reach the farmer only indirectly Several of the states in an effort to reach the farmer directly have gone a step farther and provided district agricultural high schools Such are to be found in Georgia one for every congressional district and Alabama Louisiana and Arkansas are preparing to start schools of like char acter More than this the states of Alabama Arkansas Georgia Louisiana M1ississippi South Carolina Tennessee and Texas have laws requiring the teaching of agriculture in the rural schools Be sides this the agricultural societies have done a great deal to pro mote agricultural education The Agricultural College of Georgia claims to have started the first cotton school ever held in January I908 The Farmers Union of Arkansas anticipated them by one held at Conway in 1907 Most important of all is that the unions are now more interested in education than in politics The high schools mentioned above may accomplish much but the way to reach all the farmers is through the rural schools Some farmers may still scoff at book farming but the boys contests will open their eyes If not those boys will one day be farmers and they will not forget It is not within the province of this paper to map out a definite course of study for the rural schools showing just when where and how agriculture may be taught I54The Need for Agricultural Education The possibility of such a thing is no longer debatable The pur pose of this paper is to emphasize its advisability The Negro has been told that he needs industrial education Some have accepted this advice and are securing it at Hampton and Tuskeegee When they secure this they cease to hew wood and draw water for others Recently a southern white man wanted a certain kind of plastering done but searched in vain for some one to do it At last he saw two Hampton graduates doing exactly what he wanted He employed them at 400 per day and they hired a white man to carry mortar at Ioo The Negro farmer who has been to Hampton or Tuskeegee ceases to rent or mortgage Though democratic in name and to some extent in form the American nation has never become thoroughly democratic in spirit We have often been told that America is another name for oppor tunity Now opportunity means a chance to rise above ones fel lows and especially to escape manual labor and that is what nine tenths of the Americans want Education has been shaped to pro mote this end Not every man can be at the top if there must be a top Every mans living ultimately comes out of the ground With the passage of years and the increase of population the prob lems of extracting that living become more and more acute What will become of the man white or black who has neither industrial nor cultural education Education must be democratized and made to subserve the economic interest of man This will not kill the cultural school but will foster it The man who wants to be a lawyer or a doctor or a teacher or a journalist or a novelist will have a hundred opportunities where he now has one Between I862 and I868 the United States collected 68oooooo in the way of a tax on cotton The legality of this tax was con tested and affirmed only by an evenly divided court Its injustice is now generally conceded This tax should be returned to the southern states for the benefit of rural schools with the stipula tion that agriculture should be taught I55

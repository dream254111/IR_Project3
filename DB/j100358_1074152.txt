THERE IS A CLEARNESS AND CHARM OF STYLE ABOUT THE INTRODUCTIONS AND NOTES THAT WILL ATTRACT ANYONE AT ALL INTERESTED IN OUR LITERATURE ADMIR ABLE PAPER TYPOGRAPHY AND PRESSWORK AND A RELIABLE BUCKRAM BINDING ADD SUBSTANTIALLY TO THE VALUE OF THIS ALTOGETHER WORTHY COLLECTION OF OUR GREAT POETS WORKS THROUGH THESE VOLUMES A KNOWLEDGE OF HIS MERIT MUST INEVITABLY BE MUCH EXTENDED CURRENT EDUCATIONAL LITERATURE A TASTE FOR GOOD READLING BY PROF CHARLES ELIOT NORTON IN PREFACE TO VOL II OF HEART OF OAK BOOKS A TASTE FOR GOOD READING IS AN ACQUISITION THE WORTH OF WHICH IS HARDLY TO BE OVERESTIMATED AND YET A MAJORITY OF CHILDREN EVEN OF THOSE FAVORED BY CIRCUMSTANCES GROW UP WITHOUT IT THIS DEFECT IS DUE PARTLY TO THE FAULT OR IGNORANCE OF PARENTS AND TEACHERS PARTLY ALSO TO THE WANT IN MANY CASES OF THE PROPER MEANS OF CULTIVATION FOR THIS TASTE LIKE MOST OTHERS IS USUALLY NOT SO MUCH A GIFT OF NATURE AS A PRODUCT OF CULTIVATION A WIDE DIFFERENCE EXISTS INDEED IN CHILDREN IN RESPECT TO THEIR NATURAL INCLINATION FOR READING BUT THERE ARE FEW IN WHOM IT CANNOT BE MORE OR LESS DEVELOPED BY CAREFUL AND JUDICIOUS TRAINING THIS TRAINING SHOULD BEGIN VERY EARLY EVEN BEFORE THE CHILD HAS LEARNED THE ALPHABET HIS MOTHERS LULLABY OR HIS NURSES SONGCUIRRENT EDUCATIONAL LITERATURE MAY HAVE BEGUN THE ATTUNING OF HIS EAR TO THE MELODIES OF VERSE AND THE QUICKENING OF HIS MIND WITH PLEASANT FANCIES AS HE GROWS OLDER HIS FIRST READING SHOULD BE MADE ATTRACTIVE TO HIM BY ITS EASE AND ENTERTAINMENT THE READING LESSON SHOULD NEVER BE HARD OR DULL NOR SHOULD IT BE MADE THE OCCASION FOR INSTRUCTION IN ANY SPECIFIC BRANCH OF KNOWLEDGE THE ESSENTIAL THING IS THAT IN BEGINNING TO LEARN TO READ THE CHILD SHOULD LIKE WHAT HE READS OR HEARS READ AND THAT THE MATTER SHOULD BE OF A SORT TO FIX ITSELF IN HIS MIND WITHOUT WEARISOME EFFORT HE SHOULD BE LED ON BY PLEASURE FROM STEP TO STEP HIS VERY FIRST READING SHOULD MAINLY CONSIST IN WHAT MAY CULTI VATE HIS EAR FOR THE MUSIC OF VERSE AND MAY ROUSE HIS FANCY AND TO THIS END NOTHING IS BETTER THAN THE RHYMES AND JINGLES WHICH HAVE SUNG THEMSELVES GENERATION AFTER GENERATION IN THE NURSERY OR ON THE PLAYGROUND  MOTHER GOOSE IS THE BEST PRIMER NO MATTER IF THE RHYMES BE NONSENSE VERSES MANY A POET MIGHT LEARN THE LESSON OF GOOD VERSIFICATION FROM THEM AND THE CHILD IN REPEAT ING THEM IS ACQUIRING THE ACCENT OF EMPHASIS AND OF RHYTHMICAL FORM MOREOVER THE MERE ART OF READING IS THE MORE READILY LEARNED IF THE WORDS FIRST PRESENTED TO THE EYE OF THE CHILD ARE THOSE WHICH ARE ALREADY FAMILIAR TO HIS EAR THE NEXT STEP IS EASY TO THE SHORT STORIES WHICH HAVE BEEN TOLD SINCE THE WORLD WAS YOUNG OLD FABLES IN WHICH THE TEACHINGS OF LONG EXPERIENCE ARE EMBODIED LEGENDS FAIRY TALES WHICH FORM THE TRADITIONAL COMMON STOCK OF THE FANCIES AND SENTIMENT OF THE RACE THESE NATURALLY SERVE AS THE GATE OF ENTRANCE INTO THE WIDE OPEN FIELDS OF LITERATURE ESPECIALLY INTO THOSE OF POETRY POETRY IS ONE OF THE MOST EFICIENT MEANS OF EDUCATION OF THE MORAL SENTIMENT AS WELL AS OF THE INTELLIGENCE IT IS THE SOURCE OF THE BEST CULTURE A MAN MAY KNOW ALL SCIENCE AND YET REMAIN UNEDUCATED BUT LET HIM TRULY POSSESS HIMSELF OF THE WORK OF ANY ONE OF THE GREAT POETS AND NO MATTER WHAT ELSE HE MAY FAIL TO KNOW HE IS NOT WITHOUT EDUCATION THE FIELD OF GOOD LITERATURE IS SO VAST THAT THERE IS SOMETHING IN IT FOR EVERY INTELLIGENCE BUT THE FIELD OF BAD LITERATURE IS NOT LESS BROAD AND IS LIKELY TO BE PREFERRED BY THE COMMON UNCULTIVATED TASTE TO MAKE GOOD READING MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN BAD TO GIVE RIGHT DIRECTION TO THE CHOICE THE GROWING INTELLIGENCE OF THE CHILD SHOULD BE NOURISHED WITH SELECTED PORTIONS OF THE BEST LITERATURE THE VIRTUE OF WHICH HAS BEEN APPROVED BY LONG CONSENT THESE SELECTIONS BESIDES MERIT IN POINT OF LITERARY FORM SHOULD POSSESS AS GENERAL HUMAN INTEREST AS POSSIBLE AND SHOULD BE SPECIALLY CHOSEN WITH REFERENCE TO THE CULTURE OF THE IMAGINATION THE IMAGINATION IS THE SUPREME INTELLECTUAL FACULTY AND YET IT IS OF ALL THE ONE WHICH RECEIVES LEAST ATTENTION IN OUR COMMON SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION THE REASON IS NOT FAR TO SEEK THE IMAGINATION IS OF ALL THE FACULTIES THE MOST DIFFICULT TO CONTROL IT IS THE MOST 449THZE SCHOOL REVIEW ELUSIVE OF ALL THE MOST FARREACHING IN ITS RELATIONS THE RAREST IN ITS FULL POWER BUT UPON ITS HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT DEPEND NOT ONLY THE SOUND EXERCISE OF THE FACULTIES OF OBSERVATION AND JUDGMENT BUT ALSO THE COMMAND OF THE REASON THE CONTROL OF THE WILL AND THEQUICKENING AND GROWTH OF THE MORAL SYMPATHIES THE MEANS FOR ITS CULTURE WHICH GOOD READING AFFORDS IS THE MOST GENERALLY AVAILABLE AND ONE OF THE MOST EFFICIENT THE YOUTH WHO SHALL BE COME ACQUAINTED WITH THE MASTERPIECES OF ENGLISH LITERATURE WILL SHARE IN THE COMMON STOCK OF THE INTELLECTUAL LIFE OF THE RACE TO WHICH HE BELONGS AND WILL HAVE THE DOOR OPENED TO HIM OF ALL THE VAST AND NOBLE RESOURCES OF THAT LIFE BUT THE WORTH OF THE MAS TERPIECES OF ANY ART INCREASES WITH USE AND FAMILIARITY OF ASSOCIATION THEY GROW FRESHER BY CUSTOM AND THE LOVE OF THEM DEEPENS IN PROPORTION TO THE TIME WE HAVE KNOWN THEM AND TO THE MEMORIES WITH WHICH THEY HAVE BECOME INVESTED IN THE USE OF BOOKS IN THE EDUCATION OF CHILDREN IT IS DESIRABLE THAT MUCH OF THE POETRY WHICH THEY CONTAIN SHOULD BE COMMITTED TO MEMORY TO LEARN BY HEART THE BEST POEMS IS ONE OF THE BEST PARTS OF THE SCHOOL EDUCATION OF THE CHILD BUT IT MUST BE LEARNING BY HEART THAT IS NOT MERELY BY ROTE AS A TASK BUT BY HEART AS A PLEASURE THE EXERCISE HOWEVER DIFFICULT AT FIRST BECOMES EASY WITH CONTINUAL PRACTICE AT FIRST THE TEACHER MUST GUARD AGAINST EXACTING TOO MUCH WEARINESS QUICKLY LEADS TO DISGUST AND THE YOUNG SCHOLAR SHOULD BE HELPED TO FIND DELIGHT IN WORK ITSELF O B R AN EXPERIMENT IN CORRECTING COMPOSITIONS BY WM H MAXWELL EDUCATIONAL REVIEW MARCH I894 CONSIDERING THE AMOUNT OF DRUDGERY AND THE DANGER OF NARROW ING THAT AWAITS THE THEME CRITIC WHETLIER IN THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL OR COLLEGE IT IS SURPRISING THAT SO LITTLE ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID BY CONSTRUCTORS OF EDUCATIONAL METHODS TO THE IMPORTANT MATTER OF CORRECTING COMPOSITIONS THE MOTHER TONGUE CLEAR AND ACCU RATE IS THE UNIVERSAL DEMAND BUT THE MEANS FOR SECURING THIS RE SULT ARE ESSENTIALLY UNDEVELOPED MR PRINCE IN HIS COURSES OF STUDIES AND METHODS OF TEACHING LAID DOWN THE MOST USUAL METHOD VIZ THE THEME WRITING BY THE PUPILS THE MARKING BY THE TEACHER THE REWRITING BY THE PUPILS BUT THIS METHOD IMPOSES THE VERY BURDEN THAT IT IS THE PROBLEM TO AVOID THAT OF THE UNENDURABLE DRUDGERY OF CORRECTION BY THE TEACHER UNDER THIS METHOD THE EXERCISES MUST NECESSARILY BE FEW THE CORRECTING A PERFUNCTORY TASK THE FIRST NECESSITY FURNISHING A FORMIDABLE BARRIER TO WORTHY RESULTS AND THE SECOND A SURE ROAD FOR PERFUNCTORY WORK BY THE PUPIL TO AVOID THIS SOME TEACHERS HAVE THE EXERCISES TRANS FERRED TO THE BLACKBOARD BUT PUBLIC CRITICISM IMPOSES AN UN NECESSARY AND UNDESIRABLE HUMILIATION COMPARING THE TWO SYS 450CURRENT EDUCATIONAL LITERATURE TEMS HOWEVER THE LATTER IS TO BE PREFERRED AMONG SOME OF THE RULES THAT EXPERIENCE HAS DEVELOPED REGARDING THEME WRITING ARE THE FOLLOWINGIT MUST BE A DAILY EXERCISE THE WRITERS PURPOSE MUST BE TO EXPRESS THOUGHT HENCE FAMILIAR TOPICS MUST BE SE LECTED THE SUBJECT MATTER SHOULD BE SO THOROUGHLY IN HAND THAT THINKING OR MEDITATION SHALL MONOPOLIZE NO PART OF THE COMPOSITION PERIOD REFERENCE BOOKS SHOULD BE CONVENIENT AND USABLE MODELS OF STYLE SHOULD BE STUDIED SENTENCE STRUCTURE MUST BE LEARNED BE FORE THAT OF THE PARAGRAPH FOR THE CORRECTION OF ERRORS THE FOL LOWING PLAN IS SUGGESTED THE CLASS IS ALLOWED TEN OR FIFTEEN MIN UTES IN WHICH TO WRITE WHAT THEY CAN ON THE TOPIC IN THE CLASS WORK OF THE PRECEDING DAY THEN THE PUPILS ARE TOLD TO READ EACH HIS OWN COMPOSITION SILENTLY TO DISCOVER MISTAKES IN PARAGRAPHING AND THOUGHT GROUPING AND TO MAKE CORRECTIONS BY ERASING AND IN TERLINING THE NEXT READING IS TO CORRECT THE SENTENCE STRUCTURE CAPITALIZATION AND PUNCTUATION LASTLY IT SHOULD BE READ TO DIS COVER MISSPELLED WORDS ALL DOUBTS SHOULD BE SETTLED BY APPEAL TO THE DICTIONARY SUCH AN EXERCISE CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED IN THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL IN THIRTY MINUTES THE PRACTICAL RESULT OF SUCH A SYSTEM IS TO MAKE THE COMPOSITION PERIOD ONE OF THE MOST INTER ESTING OF THE DAY THE COMPOSITIONS ARE NOT SO NEAT AS IF PAIN FULLY COPIED BUT THEY TELL OF HONEST INTELLIGENT WORK ON THE PART OF THE CHILD AND OF BURDENS LIFTED FROM THE SHOULDERS OF THE TEACHER E W SMITH THE IDEAL TRAINING OF AN AMERICAN BOY THOMAS DAVIDSON FORUM JULY IN THE AMERICAN EDUCATION OF TODAY THERE ARE TWO THINGS WHICH FORCE THEMSELVES UPON OUR ATTENTION I THAT IT IS IN A CHAOTIC CONDITION 2 THAT THIS CONDITION IS IN THE MAIN DUE TO OUR HAVING NO DEFINITE NOTION OF WHAT EDUCATION IS AIMING AT TO FIND A WAY OUT OF THIS CONDI TION WE MUST DETERMINE THE FUNDAMENTAL IDEAL OF AMERICAN LIFEOF AMERICAN MANHOOD IN A WORD THIS IS FREEDOM IDEAL AMERICANISM MEANS ABSOLUTE MORAL AUTONOMY THE ESSENTIAL CONDITIONS OF MORAL AU TONOMY ARE I WELL ARRANGED PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF MEN AND THINGS 2 HEALTHY WELLDISTRIBUTED AFFECTIONS 3 A READY WILL LOYAL TO SUCH KNOWLEDGE AND SUCH AFFECTIONS TO RAELIZE THESE MUST BE THE AIM OF AMERICAN EDUCATION ERUDITION AND PROFESSIONAL TRAINING HOWEVER NEC ESSARY AND VALUABLE FORM NO PART OF THE EDUCATION OF THE AMERICAN AS AMERICAN OR OF MAN AS MAN THIS IDEAL BOY MUST BE THE SON OF PARENTS OF UNLIMITED MEANS WITH WHOM THE QUESTION OF COST WILL NEVER BE RAISED UNTIL HE IS SEVEN YEARS OLD THE CHILD WILL BE EDUCATED MAINLY BY UNCON 45ITHE SCHOOL REVIEW SCIOUS PROCESSES IN THE FAMILY IN ASSOCIATION WITH GERMAN AND FRENCH GOVERNESSES HIS AFFECTIONS AND SYMPATHIES WILL BE CAREFULLY DIRECTED AT SEVEN HE WILL BE PUT IN A SMALL PRIVATE SCHOOL FOUNDED BY SEVERAL FAMILIES WITH THIS IDEAL AIM WHERE THE OBJECTS FOR THE NEXT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS WILL BE I TO BRING THE CHILD INTO NOBLE AND KINDLY RELATIONS TO OTHER CHILDREN ENABLING IT TO PRACTISE GENEROSITY AND SELFCONTROL 2 TO STRENGTHEN ITS BODY AND ITS SOCIAL INSTINCTS BY HEALTHY NOT OVERBOISTEROUS GAMES 3 TO DEVELOP ITS MEMORY 4 TO PUT IT IN POSSESSION OF THE MEANS OF FUTURE EDUCATION READING WRITING MANUAL FACILITY INCLUDING DRAWING AND THE ELEMENTS OF MUSIC AT THE AGE OF ELEVEN OR TWELVE THE BOY WILL BE READY EITHER R TO ATTEND A LARGE SCHOOL PUBLIC OR PRIVATE WHERE HE WILL BE DEVELOPED INTO A GOOD CITIZEN OF THE CURRENT STAMP WITH ORDINARY INTERESTS WHOLESOME DREAD OF DEPARTURE FROM ESTABLISHED TENETS OF HIS CLASS STEEPED IN MEDIOCRITY AND PHILISTINISM AND WELL CURED OF NOTIONS AND IDEALS

HISTORY BIOGRAPHY POETRY ETHICS POLITICS AND AESTHET ICS AS FOR THE DELIGHTS OF SUCH STUDY  HOW DIFFERENT IS THE ODYSSEY READ ON THE SHORES OF THE 2AGEAN  THE ORESTEIA READ IN THE DIONYSIAC THEATRE IN ATHENS OR ON THE ACROPOLIS OF MYCENAE THE PLATONIC  PHAEDO READ IN THE PRISON OF SOCRATES THE ODES OF HORACE READ ON THE HILLS BE HIND SUBIACO OR THE ORATIONS OF CICERO READ IN SIGHT OF THE ROMAN FORUM FROM WHAT THEY ARE WHEN READ AS PARSING EXERCISES IN THE SCHOOL OF A CRAMMER  FOR HARVARD OR YALE AND HOW DIFFERENT IS EVEN THE BIBLE WHEN READ IN JUDEA FROM WHAT IT IS ELSEWHERE  OUR IDEAL BOY AFTER THIS EXPERIENCE WILL HAVE THE SELFCONTROL THE EARNEST VIEW OF LIFE AND THE LARGE GENEROUS OUTLOOK THAT WILL FIT HIM TO BRAVE THE PERILS OF A COLLEGE WITH ITS HALFMEDIAEVAL HALFPROFESSIONAL CURRICULUM DRY UNINSPIRING FORMALISM USELESS ERUDITION EASY PHILISTINISM DREARY PESSIMISM PERT CALLOW GERMANISM AND ON THE PART OF THE STUDENTS ALL BUT OUR IDEAL BOY BOYISHNESS SMUG FOPPISHNESS AND STUPID DEVOTION TO HALF BRUTAL GAMES AND HALFSILLY GIRLS STILL SPITE OF ALL THIS AND MUCH MORE THERE ARE ELEMENTS IN COLLEGE LIFE WHICH THE YOUTH WHO AIMS AT FREE MAN HOOD CANNOT AFFORD TO OVERLOOK THIS VALUABLE ELEMENT CONSISTS ALMOST IF NOT QUITE ALTOGETHER IN THE SOCIAL AND FRIENDLY RELATIONS WHICH THE STU DENTS ESTABLISH WITH ONE ANOTHER IN CLOSING MR D SAYS I AM AWARE THAT THE IDEAL WHICH I HAVE SET UP IN THIS ARTICLE IS HIGH AND UNWORLDLY 452CURRENT EDU1CATIONAL LITERATURE 453 BUT I AM SURE IT IS THE TRUE AMERICAN IDEAL AND I KNOW THAT IT HAS BEEN ALREADY REALIZED BY NOT A FEW OF OUR YOUNG MEN WE CANNOT REFRAIN FROM EXPRESSING OUR OPINION THAT THIS EXCELLENT DE SCRIPTION OF THE IDEAL TRAINING OF A SNOB DOES GREAT INJUSTICE TO THE SPIRIT AND WORK OF OUR SCHOOLS AND VERY POOR SERVICE TO THE ALLIMPORTANT TOPIC IT PURPOSES TO DISCUSS AMNERIKANISCHES BILDUNGSWESEN BY PROF DR EMIL HAUSKNECHT IT IS GOOD SOMETIMES TO SEE OURSELVES AS OTHERS SEE US DR HAUSKNECHT IS AN EXPERIENCED GERMAN TEACHER WHO VISITED THE UNITED STATES IN I89O AND IN I893 SAW MUCH OF OUR SCHOOLS AND TELLS SOMETHING OF WHAT HE SAW IN THIS  WISSENSCHAFTLICHE BEILAGE IN SPITE OF RECENT REVELATIONS AS TO THE EXCEEDING SINFULNESS OF OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM WE ARE NOT SO MUCH SUR PRISED THAT H FINDS MUCH TO COMMEND THERE IS A PASSION FOR EDUCATION A HEARTHUNGER FOR EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES BOSTON HAS THE BEST SCHOOLS THOUGH MINNEAPOLIS ST PAUL DENVER INDIANAPOLIS AND WASH INGTON ARE DESERVING GREAT SUMS ARE SPENT AND SCHOOLING IS FREE EVEN MATERIALS AND TEXTBOOKS ARE FREE THIS IS NECESSARY IN THE ABSENCE OF A COMPULSORY LAW TO ATTRACT AS MANY CHILDREN AS POSSIBLE TO SCHOOL AND KEEP THEM THERE COEDUCATION STARTED IN THE WEST AS A MAKESHIFT AND HAS WON ITS WAY STEADILY EAST AS A MAKESHIFT IT IS BETTER THAN NOTHING BUT IN PRINCIPLE IT IGNORES NATURAL DIFFERENCES IN SEXES IT IS LESS HARM FUL IN THE UNITED STATES THAN IT WOULD BE IN GERMANY BECAUSE HERE THERE ARE ONLY FIVE SCHOOL DAYS A WEEK AND ONLY FIVE HOURS OF SCHOOL A DAY CONSEQUENTLY THE NERVOUS STRAIN ON GIRLS IS NOT SO GREAT AS IT WOULD BE IN GERMAN SCHOOLS THE GREAT NUMBER OF WOMEN TEACHERS IN ALL GRADES IS VERY NOTICEABLE A GREATER PROPORTION OF CAPABLE AND THOROUGHLY TRAINED MALE TEACHERS IN HIGH SCHOOLS WOULD MATERIALLY RAISE THE LEVEL OF THESE SCHOOLS SPITE OF LACK OF RELIGIOUS TRAINING IN THE SCHOOLS RELIGION IS NOWHERE ELSE SO INTENSELY MANIFESTED AS IN THE UNITED STATES THIS IS SHOWN PARTICULARLY BY THE FACT THAT ROBERT ELSMERE BY MR  HUMPHRY WARD IS TO BE FOUND EVERYWHERE WHERE THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE IS SPOKEN GYMNASTIC TRAINING IS COMING UP THOUGH YET BEHIND THAT OF GERMANY MANY GYMNASIUMS ARE SUPERLUXURIOUS IN EQUIPMENT THE GYMNASIUM OF THE WOMANS COLLEGE AT BALTIMORE EVEN HAS A SPECIAL APPARATUS FOR DRYING HAIR QUICKLY BUT IF WE ARE BEHIND GERMANY IN GYMNASTICS WE ARE DISTINCTLY AHEAD IN ALL FORMS OF OUTDOOR SPORTS THE GREAT USE MADE OF BOOKS OF REFERENCE IN OUR SCHOOLS IS NOTEWORTHY THE REASON IS PROBA BLY BECAUSE OUR TEACHERS ARE SUCH AN UNEVEN LOT WE CAN NEVER TELL WHAT THEYTHE SCHOOL REVIEW WILL KNOW SO IT IS BETTER TO SEND CHILDREN TO REFERENCE BOOKS WHICH ARE RELATIVELY CONSISTENT IN THEIR STATEMENTS OF FACTS ANOTHER AND BETTER REASON IS THE DESIRE TO CULTIVATE INDEPENDENT HABITS VERY WORTHY OF IM ITATION IS THE GREAT AMOUNT OF BLACKBOARD SPACE IN UNITED STATES SCHOOL ROOMS SEE ARTICLE TEACHING OF MATHEMATICS IN GERMANY IN OCT NUM BER FOR DESCRIPTION OF THE USUAL BLACKBOARD EQUIPMENT THERE UNIVERSITY EXTENSION IS DESCRIBED AND ILLUSTRATED BY TWO SYLLABUSES BOTH ENGLISH THE BROCHURE CLOSES WITH A SET OF EXAMINATION PAPERS FOR ADMISSION TO BRYN MAWR COLLEGE THE OBSERVATIONS ARE INTELLIGENT AND ENTIRELY FRIENDLY AND SYMPATHETIC WE FINISH THE READING WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT WE ARE NOT SUCH A HOPELESS SET AFTER ALL THE CHAOS IN MORAL TRAINING BY PROFESSOR JOHN DEWEY POPULAR SCIENCE MONTHLY AUGUST EACH STUDENT OF A LARGE CLASS WAS ASKED TO STATE SOME TYPICAL EARLY MORAL EXPERIENCE OF HIS OWN RELATING SAY TO OBEDIENCE HONESTY AND TRUTHFULNESS AND THE IMPRESSION LEFT BY THE OUTCOME UPON HIS OWN MIND ESPECIALLY THE IMPRESSION AS TO THE REASON FOR THE VIRTUE IN QUESTION NINETENTHS OF THE ANSWERS MAY BE CLASSIFIED UNDER ONE OF THE FOLLOWING HEADS THE IMPRESSION LEFT BY THE MODE OF TREATMENT WAS THAT THE MOTIVE FOR RIGHT DOING IS I FOUND IN THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE ACT 2 FEAR OF BEING PUNISHED 3 SIMPLY BECAUSE IT IS RIGHT 4 BECAUSE RIGHT DOING PLEASES THE PARENT WHILE WRONG DOING DISPLEASES 5 THE RELIGIOUS MOTIVE IN NUMBER THE RELIGIOUS MOTIVE PREDOMINATES NEXT TO THAT COMES FEAR OF PUNISHMENT OFTEN SEVERAL OF THESE REASONS WERE INCUL CATED EVERYONE WILL ADMIT WITHOUT DISPUTE THAT THE QUESTION OF THE MORAL ATTITUDE AND TENDENCIES INDUCED IN YOUTH BY THE MOTIVES FOR CON DUCT HABITUALLY BROUGHT TO BEAR IS THE ULTIMATE QUESTION IN ALL EDUCATION WHATEVER YET AS A MATTER OF FACT MORAL EDUCATION IS THE MOST HAP HAZARD OF ALL THINGS IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE RIGHT REASONS TO BE INSTILLED AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE METHODS TO BE USED IN INSTILLING THESE REASONS COME BY NATURE AS READING AND WRITING CAME TO DOG BERRY THERE IS A WIDE GULF BETWEEN THEORY AND PRACTICE EITHER PRE VAILING THEORY IS VERY WRONG OR MUCH OF PRESENT PRACTICE AS MEASURED BY IT IS BARBAROUS IN ITS DISREGARD OF SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES IN AND SO FAR AS THE CHILD CANNOT SEE THE MEANING AND VALUE OF HIS ACTS AND VALUE THEM FOR HIMSELF IT BECOMES ABSURD TO INSIST UPON QUESTIONS OF MORALITY IN CONNECTION WITH THEM A DISTINCT PAINFUL IMPRESSION WAS LEFT ON THE WRITERS MIND BY THE PAPERS OF THE COMPARATIVE FREQUENCY WITH WHICH 454CURRENT EDUCATIONAL LITERATURE PARENTS ASSUME THAT AN ACT IS CONSCIOUSLY WRONG AND PUNISH IT AS SUCH WHEN IN THE CHILDS MIND THE ACT IS SIMPLY PSYCHOLOGICALBASED UPON IDEAS AND EMOTIONS WHICH UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE NATURAL TO GIVE A REASON TO A CHILD TO SUGGEST TO HIM A MOTIVENO MATTER WHATFOR DOING THE RIGHT THING IS TO HAVE AND USE A MORAL THEORY 7HE SCOPE OF THE NORMAL SCHOOL BY M V OSHEA ATLANTIC JUNE A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF THE RISE AND WORK OF THE NORMAL SCHOOL AND THE DIFFICULTY OF GIVING IT A FIXED PLACE IN OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM  THE TRUE FUNCTION OF THE NORMAL SCHOOL WHILE YET IMPOSSIBLE TO BE FULLY REAL IZED BECAUSE OF THE CHARACTER OF OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM AS A WHOLE IS STILL BEING GRADUALLY APPROACHED AS THE DUTIES OF THE SEVERAL PARTS OF THIS SYS TEM BECOME MORE CLEARLY DEFINED AND ACCOMPLISHED IT SHOULD BE EM PHASIZED AGAIN THAT THE NORMAL SCHOOL MUST ADAPT ITSELF TO THE OTHER PARTS OF OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM IT MUST WAIT FOR THEM TO DETERMINE IN A LARGE MEASURE ITS FIELD OF USEFULNESS THAT IT HAS COME TO STAY THERE CAN BE LITTLE QUESTION AND IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME WHEN IT SHALL ATTAIN ITS IDEAL THAT OF PURELY PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION IN THE PREPARATION OF TEACHERS FOI THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS DISTRIBUTION OF GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS BY EDWARD S MORSE POPULAR SCIENCE MONTHLY AUGUST CALLS ATTENTION TO THE GREAT VALUE OF GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS AND THE EXTREMELY CARELESS AND UNSYSTEMATIC WAY IN WHICH THEY ARE DISTRIBUTED IF IT WERE POSSIBLE TO ESTABLISH A SEPARATE BUREAU OF DISTRIBUTION IT WOULD LEAD TO ECONOMY OF ADMINISTRATION TO THE ECONOMICAL AND EFFICACIOUS DIS TRIBUTION OF REPORTS THE AVOIDANCE OF DUPLICATION AND CONSEQUENTLY THE PLACING OF MATERIAL WHERE IT WOULD DO THE MOST GOOD OR AT LEAST WHERE IT WOULD NOT BE USED TO KINDLE THE KITCHEN FIRE REPORTS WHICH TEND TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF HUMAN LEARNING PRINTED AND DISTRIBUTED AS THEY ARE FREELY BY THE NATION

ITSELF IN TERMS OF WILLED ACTION WHICH IS THE LANGUAGE OF COM PLETE MEN THE COLLEGE GRADUATE AND PUBLIC LIFE BY THEODORE ROOSEVELT ATLANTIC AUGUST THE FIRST GREAT LESSON WHICH THE COLLEGE GRADUATE SHOULD LEARN IS THE LESSON OF WORK RATHER THAN OF CRITICISM CRITICISM IS NECESSARY AND USE FUL IT IS OFTEN INDISPENSABLE BUT IT CAN NEVER TAKE THE PLACE OF ACTION OR BE EVEN A POOR SUBSTITUTE FOR IT IT IS THE DOER OF DEEDS WHO ACTUALLY COUNTS IN THE BATTLE OF LIFE 456

j100011,Biological Bulletin,1535731,The Cause of the Production of Down and Other DownLike Structures in the Plumages of Birds,i268197,THE CAUSE OF THE PRODUCTION OF DOWN AND OTHER DOWNLIKE STRUCTURES IN THE PLUMAGES OF BIRDS OSCAR RIDDLE A recent paper 07 by Dr Lynds Jones makes clear the morphological relations of  down and definitive feathers Jones work some experimental results already reported by the writer 07 o8 together with some hitherto unpublished data bearing on the physiology of avian plumages now enlable us to make some fairly definite statements concerning the causes which lead to the production of  down A number of obser vations and experiments on the relations which exist between the rate of growth and the character of the feather structure produced pennaceous or plumulaceous  also suggest some interesting conclusions It will be shown later that results from these various angles of approach center about a common point Jones studies demonstrate positively that  the first down and its succeeding definitive feather are produced by one continuous growth and therefore cannot be regarded as two distinct feathers The first down is the plumulaceous tip of the first definitive feather p 17 This writer has however failed to homologize the modified region which connects the two parts of such a feather with any thing already known and apparently he has not perceived the actual cause of this modification To point out the homologies and state the cause of the various modifications found in the down to show how the  down  and the plumulaceous proximal parts of pennaceous feathers are related to their rate of growth and in connection with this latter point to put forward a general theory of the significance and relations of all plumulaceous and pennaceous feather structures is the purpose of the present paper HOMOLOGIES OF THE MODIFIED REGION OF THE DOWN Anyone who is familiar with the several forms of feather defects or faultbars which have elsewhere been fully described by the I63OSCAR RIDDLE writer 07 o8 will find that Jones plates and description practically prove the existence of another variety of this same defect in other words one may say that the modified region of the down  the  quill  is a variety of defect which we have already recognized in other situations but which here occurs in a very uniform way at a point near the end of the feathers of the first plumage The fact is simply that the defective region falls so close to the end of the feather that it does not include any of the shaft of the feather to which it belongs There can be I think no question as to this interpretation The exact conditions met with in the defects or faultbars already referred to are to be found in the modified region of the down i In the modification or absence of barbules Davies 89 Jones 2 in the occasional fusion of the barbs Klee 86 Davies Jones 3 in the diminished differentiation Davies Jones and growth Davies 4 in a defective development between a more distal and a more proximal part of the same feather Jones Now if the  quill region of the down is the morphological equivalent of the faultbars which are often produced  normally  and which have been produced at will experimentally at all levels in the definitive feather we should expect to find that the two have the same or a similar cause What is the evidence for such a common cause  What causes the production of down   THE CAUSE OF THE MODIFICATIONS IN THE DOWN It has been established beyond question that the several types of faultbars are produced by insufficient nutrition even the variations produced in the available foodsupply by the daily fluctuations in bloodpressure was shown to be able to leave its mark on feather structure Riddle 07 o8 What now is the evidence that reduced or insufficient nutrition is the cause of the modification which occurs near the distal ends of the first feathers of birds The most highly modified region of the down i c the  quill region is produced in all cases so far as I am able to ascertain after and soon after the hatching of the bird There are the following reasons for a defective nutrition at that time 164CAUSE OF PRODUCTION OF  DOWN I The whole source of foodsupply for the young bird is now changed Heretofore as an embryo it has formed its tissues from substances once assimilated by the motherbird and stored by her within the egg from which it extracts them by means of the yolksac  a provisional appendage of the gut henceforth it is subject to the vicissitudes of a much greater and very com petitive world for its foodsupply and its entire alimentary tract with its various appendages new and untried as it all is must now begin to work  and work properly and successfully on the hodgepodge of digestibles and indigestibles which here begin their intermittent flow into it If there is ever such a thing as a  critical period in a birds life indeed it is here We should have the strangest of miracles performed before our very eyes if this transformation and adjustment were to occur instantaneously and without interruption of any of the nutritive processes of the animal 2 The skin of the bird is exposed to the chilling and evaporat ing effects of the air this doubtless lessens the bloodsupply to the integumentary structures This chilling moreover is now of all times the most effective for the bird now has the least plumage to help it retain its heat then too the heat radiating surface  the skin  is greater in proportion to the mass of the animal than it will ever be again and therefore the heat loss at that time is greatest It is of course true that such an organism tends to make good the greater heat loss by increased heat pro duction but this latter process means at the same time a greater use and destruction of food at a time when as stated above the nutritive mechanism of the animal has not got into full swing We are however in possession of some direct evidence that a faulty nutrition is the cause of the production of the down I If a chick is kept continuously underfed from the time of hatching and while in its downy plumage it will be found that almost all of the feathers except primaries secondaries and a few others can be kept in the  downy condition and the bird can thus be made to wear its downy plumage for months many kept four to five months The 1 quill region is a part of the feather which  normally almost refuses to grow by reducing the foodsupply during andOSCAR RIDDLE after its formation further growth may be absolutely inhibited or stopped If therefore faulty nutrition can and does completely halt the growth at the proximal part of the quill there is every reason to believe that the same cause may have acted as the check upon the growth at the distal and all intermediate parts of the quill and since it has been shown that the structures pro d FIG I A feather from the humeral tract of an underfed chick four months old d downy portion

produced by malnutrition it becomes extremely probable that an insufficient foodsupply is he cause of the  quill  formation also 2 The case just cited is supplemented and strengthened by the peculiar structure of certain feathers from the humeral region of one of the chicks mentioned in the experiment above which were able to continue their growth under the conditions of my experi ment These feathers have all the appearance and texture of down excepting the presence of a very slender shaft The barbs how ever are not closely set into this shaft as they are in a normally grown feather but unite with it only at wide intervals This is clearly an approximation to the conditions in the down where the barbs do not unite at all The shaft moreover bears barbules and these again are exactly like those borne on barbs Such a feather is shown in Fig I 3 In the plumulaceous basal parts of the feathers of the chick I have produced structural conditions which are in many ways like those of down and am in a position to state definitely that they were produced by  starving  the bird In Fig 2 is shown a section of a feather bearing such downy formations 4 A fourth line of evidence that the down  or rather its basal portionis produced under poor nutritive conditions is afforded by the fact that the most emphasized of the down mal formations the horny cylinder or quill  is to be found most frequently among the altricial birds as was pointed out by Jones Jones does not state that the  quill  is the most extreme modi fication of these downy structures but both his work and mine confirm that view I quote the following single paragraph which Jones writes on quillformation and which seems to include something else quite as important  The progress of transition which results in a socalled quill or tube differs in some important particulars from that just given In the early stages of development no difference is recognizable but at a little later stage the whole mass of inter mediate cells Fig 45 P1 IV clin as well as the sheath cells cltu become much flattened their nuclei elongated and their i67OSCAR RIDDLE FIG 2 A section of the proximal plumulaceous portion of a body

cell boundaries lost in a mass of fibrous tissue Only the row of cells next to the pulp representing the cylinder cell layer retains its characteristic shape At a still later stage in develop ment represented by Fig 46 in which the epitrichial sheath is not shown cornification of the outer rows of cells representing the region of the sheath cells has taken place only suggestions of its original fibrous structure remaining The outermost inter mediate cells have become almost wholly fibrous narrow spaces representing the position of the nuclei The process of cornifi cation now proceeds rapidly until practically all of the intermedi ate cells become cornified and the cylinder cell layer becomes I68CAUSE OF PRODUCTION OF  DOWN fibrous Fig 33 Pl III represents the final stage in develop ment That the formation of this horny tube is wholly different from the process by which the shaft and quill of the definitive feather are formed as described by Davies p 594 et seq is evident Instead of being a process designed for the accomplish ment of a definite work  the building of shaft and quill  it appears to be due to a lack of differentiation of the cell mass and a short cut to cornification of the tissues induced by a reduced blood supply to this part of the feather during the period when the cells would be showing differentiation if supplied with suffi cient nourishment It is significant that this condition of a corni fied ring instead of the normal barbvanes is more often found among the strictly altricial birds which are hatched in a helpless condition It is well known that the first few days after the hatching of altricial birds are the most critical days of their lives During this critical period there appears to be no growth of the down An American robin which hatched on the fourteenth day of incubation possessed the usual down upon the head and back These downs made no further growth It was not until the fourth day after hatching that the skin gave evidence of the beginning of the definitive feathers On the eighth day after hatching the skin surface was exposed to the drying influences of the air before renewed activity in the feather germ began During this interval of four days the socalled  quill  was formed at the proximal end of the down by the rapid drying of the im perfectly formed barbvane ridges  p I 3 I wish to make a number of statements concerning the para graph just quoted for from my point of view a number of things are here touched  but hardly grasped  and at any rate not made really clear In the first place the statement is made here and elsewhere that in the formation of the quill a lack of differentiation is the process at fault My own studies on similar structures and I think Jones plates as well as some points of his descrip tion show the same indicate that while lack of differentiation is undoubtedly a part of the process a more important part is lack of growth The barbules for example do not differentiate but the cells which should form them do not grow That is to I69OSCAR RIDDLE say many of the necessary cells never arise at all and those which are to be found in the barbule region never attain the normal size of such cells Davies recognized to a certain extent at least a deficiency of growth of particular parts of this region He states  Gew6hnlich verschwinden in the quill die Leisten nicht vollkommen obgleich sie eine bedeutende verminderung ihre Gr6sse erfahren  p 58I On the other hand one kind of differentiation i e cornification or development of keratin pro ceeds without interruption in all of these cases Jones further states that apparently this  lack of differentia tion    is induced by a reduced blood supply to this part of the feather etc He is here speaking of the conditions in the quill formations only and does not apply this statement to the other form of down modification which he considers p I I the typical one He does not furnish any evidence for the statement just quoted and does not refer to the direct and conclusive evi dence which my paper 07 suppliesand I may add that this is still the only direct evidence we havethat a reduced blood supply tends to produce just such feather modifications as are represented in the quill of the down Jones observation that there appears to be no growth of the down in altricial birds during t this critical period is important and suggestive as supporting the view that wherever we find the 1 down  we can assert that it signifies defective nutritive condi tions in the bird at the time that part of the feather was grown It is however doubtful whether Jones had anything similar to this in mind for it will be seen that his last word on this subject is that in the robin the only specific case cited the socalled quill was formed at the proximal end of the down by the rapid drying of the imperfectly formed barbvane ridges Finally it should be noted that Jones states that in the case of the young robins the  quill was formed during the fourth to the eighth days after hatching It seems to me extremely probable that the first four days after hatching were even more important in producing the modification than the four succeeding ones I70CAUSE OF PRODUCTION OF  DOWN RATE OF GROWTH IN RELATION TO THE KIND OF FEATHER STRUCTURE PRODUCED It is well known that down  i e the distal plumulaceous tip of the feather and the plumulaceous proximal parts of pen naceous feathers are similar as regards their appearance and texture They all possess long slender barbulesusually without hooked barbicles So far as my observation goes all have the barbules set rather widely apart and have a fluffy appearance Since Jones has shown that the  down is the plumulaceous tip of the first definitive feather and since in all typical pennaceous feathers we have also a plumulaceous proximal end of the feather what does it mean in the development of the first feather that two plumulaceous regions are produced with a pennaceous region between  The writer is convinced that the type of feather structure pro duced is somehow quite definitely correlated with the relative rate of growth at which the various parts of the feather are developed The following facts and observations are submitted in favor of this view I That the  down  is of slow growth is proved by the works of several writers  Studer 73 Klee 86 Davies and Jones among others  who have shown that in various birds the down begins to develop from the fifth to the eighth day in the egg and continues usually fifteen to twenty days or longer This when compared with the growth which succeeds it is obviously very slow Dwight oo also notes that during the early days of the newlyhatched chick passerine birds feather growth is com paratively slow but shortly it proceeds with marvelous rapidity P 99 2 If a feather from a juvenal plumage is taken for considera tion it may be said that that part of the feather which lies between the  down  plumulaceous and the basal plumulaceous portion of the feather is grown rectrices or remiges of ringdove at an average of more than twice the rate of either of these extremities The slow rate of growth of t down  is selfevident The fol lowing measurements in mm of a rectrix of the ringdove are given to show that the above statement is true as applied to the proximal plumulaceous growth 171OSCAR RIDDLE TABLE I SHOWING RATE OF GROWTH OF RECTRIX OF RINGDOVE Turtur risorius Days after appearance 4 8 91I 1215 1620 225 26 27 2832 beyond skin  Length of feather

formation begins At first only those barbs which lie in the germ opposite to the shaft are affected but as growth proceeds and as the rate of growth diminishes more and more barbs become affected After having watched the rate of growth of many feathers in chicks and doves only to find that the plumulaceous part always begins at the point of or after a considerable falling off in this rate of growth one is tempted to the conclusion that in these feathers the two kinds of feather growth plumulaceous and pen naceous are merely expressions of slow and rapid growth re spectively It is I think moreover quite certain that for many birds the general rule can be laid down that those feathers which as a whole grow slowest have the greatest proportion of plumulaceous growth One is led by such considerations to inquire whether all strictly plumulaceous feathers are of slow growth I know but little of these conditions from personal observation but the known facts in so far as I have been able to ascertain them are in harmony with this view It is stated that the ostrich plumes grow at the rate of one inch per week For such feathers of such birds this is indeed a slow rateonly about 35 mm per day whereas a little newly hatched ringdove will grow remiges and rectrices at from 5 to 7 mm per day I feel confident that it will be found that all plumulaceous feathers are grown at a relatively slow rate The aftershaft hyporhachis which is found in many feathers is another plumulaceous formation and like the others is of slow growth It seems to me highly probable that a closer study of 172CAUSE OF PRODUCTION OF DOWN the nutritive conditions in this region of feathergerms would reveal the reason for the presence of this featheraccessory in some plumes and its absence in others The true quill calamus also shares this slow growth of the proximal end of the feather Indeed it is in the quill that we find the slowest rate of growth to be met with in the whole length of the feather I am inclined to  explain  the quill as the type of feather formation which results from nutritive conditions which become slowly and progressively poorer this in turn is able to almost completely stop growth and celldivision but affects the process of cornification i e keratin formation to a much smaller extent It seems to me too that our knowledge of feather growth quillformation in the Japanese fowls particularly the results of Cunninghams 03 experiments and many other facts support this conclusion Neither the position nor the presence of a quill is  predetermined  in the feather but both of these are merely marks left along the course of the ebbing tide of a greatly diminished feather nutrition The fact that plumulaceous structures do not show the maxi mum of growth and differentiation e g weaker barbs and bar bules without hooklets together with the observation that such regions occasionally result from underfeeding Fig i would seem to lend weight to the view that such regions or such entire feathers are grown under nutritive conditions considerably below the optimum It should be remarked that if the view here put forward is cor rect it would lead us to expect a pretty general occurrence of growthmarks oni all feathers which are growing at the time of hatching and soon thereafter Such marks seem not to have been reported for the rather extraordinary first feathers of the Anserine birds My own observations on this plumage of these birds are too meager to mention but it seems quite probable that such marks are much less in evidence there if they exist at a 1  than in most other birds It is conceivable however that the young of these birds have a greater quantity of eggyolk left for their first day or two after hatching or that they have a con siderable store of available fat in their bodies or yet another means of tiding them over the  critical period which in these 173OSCAR RIDDIE birds is of course very short On this point however I can furnish no observations of value and can only say that the exact conditions in these forms are not clear It must be left to the further investigations of those who in the course of their studies are able to examine the plumages particu larly the plumulaceous ones of all of the families of birds to decide whether the theory here advanced of the slow rate of growth of the several plumulaceous formations can be universally and absolutely applied It is the hope of the writer that some one may have the material and the inclination to put this part of the work here reported to a more rigorous test than the writers limited material has permitted him to do METHODS AND MATERIALS For the experimental part of the work here reported only a few forms have been used but these few animals have been very closely watched and studied Nearly all the starving experiments were made on the young of the chick Gallus domnesticus and both on the young and old of the ringdoves Turtur risorius For the modifications of the nature of the feather growth the chicks are by far the better material Control experiments were main tained throughout It should be said that the underfeeding or 1 starving of these animals was usually either accompanied or accomplished by the feeding of the fatstain Sudan III which appears to  tie up  the fats of the body The stain was fed for a purpose not immedi ately connected with the results reported here but there is little doubt that it has no specific action on the feathers except in so far as it helps to bring about  starving conditions in the animal SUMMARY I The highly modified region of the  down  is in all respects similar to other feather defects or faultbars which have already been described as occurring at any and all levels in definitive feathers 2 Juvenal feathers can by underfeeding be made to persist chick in the downy conditions practically without growth for several months if the reduced feeding be begun immediately after hatching I74CAUSE OF PRODUCTION OF  DOWN 3 Occasionally feathers may be found which have been able to continue their growth proximal to the downy portion despite the inhibitor influences of the lack of food such feathers have been found to represent a type of structure intermediate to the downy and pennaceous formations 4 The cause of the modification at the base of the down is to be traced to an interruption or at any rate to the inadequacy of the nutritive processes of the bird This interruption is doubt less partly accounted for by the change of source of food from the embryonic to the adult life 5 The apparent absence of such growthmarks in the feathers of the duck and other anserine birds remains unexplained 6 The rate of growth of the two ends of a juvenal pennaceous feather and of the proximal ends of all pennaceous feathers which bear a plumulaceous proximal portion is much slower than the rate of growth in the central pennaceous part of the feather 7 It seems probable that all plumulaceous structures are pro duced at a relatively slow rate of growth and also probable that during their growth they have not enjoyed optimum nutritive conditions 8 The formation of the quill is probably the direct result of a progressive diminution of an already lessened foodsupply I75OSCAR RIDDLE LITERATURE Studer T 73 Die Entwicklung der Feder InaugDissert Philos Facult Bern 29 p 2 I873

1 ELECTROMAGNETIC CONTROL OF STOPWATCH This little instrument serves a twofold purpose it safe guards the stopwatch against damage by careless handling and it enables E or O to actuate the watch at a distance The control was suggested to me by Jastrows  Electric At tachment for the Stop Watch which is figured in the cata logue of the Garden City Model Works 1894 no 11 It consists essentially of an electromagnet with pivoted armature reinforced by a coiled spring Watch and magnet are cased in a house of cast metal with round window for the watch face and the clips that hold watch to stand the pin that governs the tension of the spring and the actuating button of the armature are all adjustable so that the control may be applied to any make of watch If the spring is set at the right degree of tension and if the armature button is centred on the stem of the watch and moves in accurate alignment with the pushpin the arrangement workswith the ordinary cheap stopwatchon a single dry cell a refractory watch may need two cells The click at make which is sometimes dis turbing may be lessened by papering the face of the armature The control is sold by the C H Stoelting Co 3047 Carroll Avenue Chicago Ill 2 CURVE TRACER It has always been difficult to draw accurately arcs of circles of large radius Since these curves are variously useful in laboratory work I have asked the C H Stoelting Co to manu facture Weitzenb6cks device described by K Biihler Die Gestaltwahrnehmungen i 1913 72 The model supplied to the Cornell Laboratory has been subjected to preliminary tests and appears to work as accurately as the Wolz original 3 MODELS FOR THE DEMONSTRATION OF SENSORY QUALITIES There is nothing like a geometrical model for bringing home to beginners in psychology the nature of the qualitative series 212NOTES FROM CORNELL LABORATORY and the positional character of the qualitative attributes Some years ago I described a demonstrational color pyramid this JOURNAL XX 1909 15 ff I wish now to say a word regarding a set of four simpler frame or outline models that I have found useful for demonstration in introductory courses Dimensions do not matter though on general prin ciples the larger the models are made the better The frames are built of light metal rods blackened whose ends are held together by cubical blocks of blackened wood The blocks are bored to receive the posts of paper flags which show the initials or other symbols of the terminal qualities The rods further carry one or more sliding blocks for the similar indication of intermediate qualities The frames thus constructed will stand on any face the flags may be inter changed for demonstrational purposes within the given model and wires may be stretched as wanted across surfaceplanes and interiors The four models are the color double pyramid the taste tetrahedron and the smell prism H Henning Zeits f Psych lxxiii 1915 254 f lxxiv 1916 212 and a touch pyramid here figured Tickle  Quick tch Bright Pain Pressur Contct  i Ache Pck Strain Nesutral Pressure I need hardly say that several of my determinations of the touch qualities are tentative and that I regard their arrange ment at best as only a rough approximation to the truth I publish the figure because I think it marks the direction of recent work because it may perhaps serve as the starting point of new experiments and also for the more personal reason that I have shown the model in my lectures of the past two years and that the observers in certain investigations shortly to be published from the Cornell Laboratory have therefore been familiar with its terms and series 213For the place assigned to heat see F Cutolo this JOURNAL xxix 1918 445 447 f for what I have called quick pain see E Becher Arch f d ges Psych xxxiv 1915 205 Warmth and cold for the present baffle me completely I can not bring them into qualitative relation with the terms of the figure but the fact that they are left outstandingI admit that it is a real difficultycannot of itself discredit the figure and can still less discredit the underlying idea Finally au ditory sensations may be systematized in various ways and 1 have no doubt that some sort of closed figure will presently be found adequate to them So long however as tonality and vocality are in debate it is hardly safe to propose an arrange ment of qualities 4 SEWING MACHINE MOTOR I am indebted to Dr E G Boring now of Clark University for calling my attention to this motor which is sold under the name  Sew EZ  or Home Motor by the Hamilton Beach Manufacturing Company Racine Wis The motor is intended for use with sewing machines and in other household operations For color mixing in the laboratory it has various merits it requires practically no attention and stands hard usage The motor is strongly cased and its oilcups are ac cessible It will operate on either alternating or direct 110volt current It runs in both directions the direction is reversed very simply by loosening a setscrew and shifting the brushes The motor is provided with a 6speed rheostat operated against a spring by a foottreadle The rheostat can be re moved from its attachments and turned by hand on the table Thus separated it is convenient and compact 4 cm high by 7 cm diam The motor itself with its base goes within a 15 cm cube The motor is light in weight and though it is steady enough for ordinary color mixing must be clamped to the table if the discs are unbalanced as in photometry by the Kirschmann method The motor has very little power but great speed Borings tests show that on noload the six points of the rheostat give about 2000 4500 7000 9500 12000 and 13000 r p m A load of discs largely reduces this speed but 20 cm discs can be rotated on the fourth rheostat point at a speed of 4000 r p m which is ample to prevent flicker The Cornell Laboratory has had the sewing machine motor in steady use since 1916 and the Clark Laboratory has recently adopted it The current price without discounts of motor rheostat connecting cord and pulley is 1850 214 TITCHENER

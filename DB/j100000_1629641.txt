many smaller streams that before had indepehdent courses As the valleys of the consequent streams were deepened trenches were cut through the resistant strata of the white Jura whose retreating margin was in time worn back southeast to form a cuesta with an infacing escarpment while an inner lowland was opened on the weak Lias beds between the escarpment and the crystallines of the Black forest Today only one of the consequents BregeDanube re tains its course through the cuesta The Wutach has been diverted from the Aitrach to the Rhine the Brigach has been captured from the Elta by the Danube itself and the Neckar has taken the Eschach from the Faulenbach Similar changes are known for a long distance northeast of the Eschach where the phenomena associated with the drainage of

STUDY OF ECLIPSE METEOROLOGY IN his paper on The Eclipse Cyclone and the Diurnal Cyclone Proc Amer Acad Arts and Sci XXXVI Jan 1901 307318 Clayton has gone far ahead of all previous investiga tors of the phenomena of eclipse meteorology Hitherto as a general rule we have had little more than a few scattered observations of tem perature pressure wind direction etc taken during an eclipse and tabulated with a brief summary of the results In his study of the meteorological data obtained in connection with the total solar eclipse of May 28th last Clayton has derived results of farreaching importance which throw light on two of the largest problems in meteorology The meteorological changes due to the eclipse were first separated from other changes such as the diurnal and the cyclonic and were then plotted on maps of the United States for 815 and for 9 A M May 28th 75th meridian time These maps show that the winds were prac tically reversed in direction as the umbra moved from one side of the continent to the other both maps showing a distinct anticyclonic circulation and an outflow of air extending from the umbra to a distance of about 1500 or 2000 miles The temperature depression due to the eclipse appears on the 9 AM chart as an oval area At the central portion of this area the depression exceeds 8 Fahr and this area of greatest cold lags behind the umbra about 500 miles A third chart was constructed by plot ting the stations at their proper distances from the path of the umbra and plotting the succes sive 15minute observations at intervals of about 500 miles the result being a synoptic chart showing the conditions observed at any station or group of stations when they were in different portions of the eclipse area This synoptic chart indicates distinctly an anticyclonic circulation of the wind around the center of the eclipse ex tending out to a distance of about 1500 miles from the umbra Beyond this there are indi cations of another ring of outflowing winds The isotherms show an elliptical area of cold air inner isotherm 6 Fahr central about 500 miles in the rear of the umbra There was a rise of absolute and of relative humidity during the eclipse the shape and position of the areas showing the humidity departures being very similar to those of the temperature The pres sure changes in this eclipse and in other eclipses show that in normal eclipses there is a central area of relatively high pressure surrounding this a ring of minimum pressure and beyond this outside the edge of the penumbra is a ring of maximum pressure The low temperature the circulation of winds and the form of the pressure curve all proclaim the development by the eclipse of a cold air cyclone as described by Ferrel Mr Clayton points out that the eclipse may be com pared with an experiment by Nature in which all the causes that complicate the origin of the ordinary cyclone are eliminated except that of a direct and rapid change of temperature The result shows that a fall of temperature is capable of developing acoldair cyclone in an astonish ingly short time with all the peculiar circulation of winds and distribution of pressure which constitute such a cyclone The fall of tem perature acts primarily to cause a cyclone and 352 SCIENCESCIENCE the anticyclone is a secondary phenomenon a part of the cyclone The eclipse cyclone to keep pace with the eclipse shadow must con tinuously have formed within the shadow and must have dissipated in the rear almost in stantly The motion may thus be considered to have a certain analogy to wave mo ion In the light of his discovery that the brief fall of temperature in the eclipse can produce a well developed cyclone which accompanies the eclipse shadow at the rate of about 2000 miles an hour Clayton believes that the fallof temperature due to the occurrence of night must also produce or tend to produce a cold air cyclone Since the heat of day produces or tends to produce a warmair cyclone there must tend to occur each day two minima of pressure one near the coldest part of the day and another near the warmest part of the day with areas of high pressure between them due to the overlapping of the pericyclones surround ing the coldair and the warmair cyclones respectively These causes must in the opin ion of the author produce entirely or in part the wellknown double diurnal period in air pressure a question which has long puzzled meteorologists and for which as yet no wholly satisfactory explanation has been offered The surfade winds at Cordoba Argentina and at Blue Hill are in general found to be in opposite directions and to indicate a circulation of the wind around two cyclonic centers passing along the equator and an outflow from high pres sures half way between them Claytons conclusions which are to be pre sented in greater detail in a forthcoming Bul letin of the Blue Hill Observatory are of the greatest interest and importance His expla nation of the diurnal variation of the barometer seems to have in it many evidences of being the best yet offered to account for this puzzling phenomenon Meteorologists will now look for ward to future solar eclipses with greatly in creased interest because of the importance which Mr Clayton has shown to be attached to eclipse meteorology It is to be hoped that Mr Clayton may have the time and the oppor tunity to extend his investigation further in connection with previous eclipses R DEC WARD 353 THE MAGNETIC SURVEY OF THE UNITED STATES ON July 1 1899 a special division of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office was created by the Superintendent to take charge of the magnetic survey of the United States and the countries under its jurisdiction which up to that time had been conducted under the super vision of the Computing Division of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Since that date magnetic observations namely declination dip and in tensity of magnetic force have been made up to December 31 1900 at about 500 stations dis tributed over the United States Alaska and the Hawaiian Islands At most of the stations per manent marks have been established for the use of the surveyor Special consideration has also been given to the needs of the mariner espe cially in Alaskan waters where occur places of pronounced local attraction affecting the com passes on board ship all the way from onefourth of a point to four points Special stations known as  repeat or secu lar variation stations have also been estab lished in different parts of the country At these observations will be repeated at stated intervals in order to determine the amount of secular change in the magnetic elements It is the endeavor whenever possible to establish such stations in the vicinities of colleges and universities as experience has shown that on college grounds we may hope for a permanency of station for a fairly long interval Of special state surveys mention may be made first of the completion of the magnetic survey of Maryland which was undertaken primarily by the Maryland Geological Survey with assistance rendered by this Bureau second the comple tion of the magnetic survey of North Carolina conducted under the joint auspices of this Bureau and the North Carolina Geological Sur vey third the completion of the magnetic sur vey of West Virginia and fourth the completion of the magnetic survey of Iowa Fair progress has also been made in the establishment of the Magnetic Base Stations where the countless variations of the earths magnetism will be recorded photographically Thus a temporary magnetic observatory has been in operation at Baldwin Kansas since MARCH 1 1901

J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,106456,DESCRIPTION OF A LAMPMICROMETER AND THE METHOD OF USING IT BY MR WILLIAM HERSCHEL F R S,I206937,163 XIII DESCRIPTION OF A LAMPMICROMETER AND THE METHOD OF USING IT BY MR WILLIAM HERSCHEL F R S READ JANUARY 31 1782 THE GREAT DIFFICULTY OF MEASURING VERY SMALL ANGLES SUCH AS HARDLY AMOUNT TO A FEW SECONDS IS WELL KNOWN TO ASTRONOMERS SINCE I HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN OBSERVATIONS ON DOUBLE STARS I HAVE HAD SO MUCH OCCASION FOR MICROMETERS THAT WOULD MEASURE EXCEEDING SMALL DISTANCES EXACTLY THAT I HAVE CONTINUALLY BEEN ENDEAVOURING TO IMPROVE THESE INSTRUMENTS THE NATURAL IMPERFECTIONS OF THE PARALLEL WIRE MICROMETER IN TAKING THE DISTANCE OF VERY CLOSE DOUBLE STARS ARE THE FOLLOW ING WHEN TWO STARS ARE TAKEN BETWEEN THE PARALLELS THE DIA METERS MUST BE INCLUDED I HAVE IN VAIN ATTEMPTED TO FIND LINES SUFFICIENTLY THIN TO EXTEND THEM ACROSS THE CENTERS OF THE STARS SO THAT THEIR THICKNESS MIGHT BE NEGLECTED THE SINGLE THREADS OF THE SILKWORM WITH SUCH LENSES AS I USE ARE SO MUCH MAG NIFIED THAT THEIR DIAMETER IS MORE THAN THAT OF MANY OF THE STARS BESIDES IF THEY WERE MUCH LESS THAN THEY ARE THE POWER OF DEFLECTION OF LIGHT WOULD MAKE THE ATTEMPT TO MEA SURE THE DISTANCE OF THE CENTERS THIS WAY FRUITLESS FOR I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND THE LIGHT OF THE STARS TO PLAY UPON THOSE LINES AND SEPARATE THEIR APPARENT DIAMETERS INTO TWO PARTS NOW SINCE THE SPURIOUS DIAMETERS OF THE STARS THUS INCLUDED TO MY CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE ARE CONTINUALLY CHANGING ACCORDING TO THE STATE OF THE AIR AND THE LENGTH OF TIME WE LOOK AT THEM WE ARE IN Y 2 SOME164 MR HERSCHELS DESCRIPTION OF SOME RESPECT LEFT AT AN UNCERTAINTY AND OUR MEASURES TAKEN AT DIFFERENT TIMES AND WITH DIFFERENT DEGREES OF ATTENTION WILL VARY ON THAT ACCOUNT NOR CAN WE COME AT THE TRUE DISTANCE OF THE CENTERS OF ANY TWO STARS ONE FROM ANOTHER UNLESS WE COULD TELL WHAT TO ALLOW FOR THE SEMIDIAMETERS OF THE STARS THEMSELVES FOR DIFFERENT STARS HAVE DIFFERENT APPARENT DIAME TERS WHICH WITH A POWER OF 227 MAY DIFFER FROM EACH OTHER AS I HAVE EXPERIENCED AS FAR AS TWO SECONDS THE NEXT IMPERFECTION IS THAT WHICH ARISES FROM A DEFLECTION OF LIGHT UPON THE WIRES WHEN THEY APPROACH VERY NEAR TO EACH OTHER FOR IF THIS BE OWING TO A POWER OF REPULSION LODGED AT THE SURFACE IT IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND THAT SUCH POWERS MUST IN TERFERE WITH EACH OTHER AND GIVE THE MEASURES LARGER IN PRO PORTION THAN THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN IF THE REPULSIVE POWER OF ONE WIRE HAD NOT BEEN OPPOSED BY A CONTRARY POWER OF THE OTHER WIRE ANOTHER VERY CONSIDERABLE IMPERFECTION OF THESE MICROMETERS IS A CONTINUAL UNCERTAINTY OF THE REAL ZERO I HAVE FOUND THAT THE LEAST ALTERATION IN THE SITUATION AND QUANTITY OF LIGHT WILL AFFECT THE ZERO AND THAT A CHANGE IN THE POSITION OF THE WIRES WHEN THE LIGHT AND OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES REMAIN UNALTERED WILL ALSO PRODUCE A DIFFERENCE TO OBVIATE THIS DIFFICULTY WHEN EVER I TOOK A MEASURE THAT REQUIRED THE UTMOST ACCURACY MY ZERO WAS ALWAYS TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER WHILE THE APPARATUS REMAINED IN THE SAME SITUATION IT WAS IN WHEN THE MEASURE WAS TAKEN BUT THIS ENHANCES THE DIFFICULTY BECAUSE IT INTRODUCES AN ADDITIONAL OBSERVATION THE NEXT IMPERFECTION WHICH IS NONE OF THE SMALLEST IS THAT EVERY MICROMETER THAT HAS HITHERTO BEEN IN USE REQUIRES EITHER A SCREW OR A DIVIDED BAR AND PINION TO MEASURE THE DIS TANCE OF THE WIRES OR DIVIDED IMAGE THOSE WHO ARE AC QUAINTEDA LAMPMICROMETER 165 QUAINTED WITH WORKS OF THIS KIND ARE BUT TOO SENSIBLE HOW DIFFI CULT IT IS TO HAVE SCREWS THAT SHALL BE PERFECTLY EQUAL IN EVERY THREAD OR REVOLUTION OF EACH THREAD OR PINIONS AND BARS THAT SHALL BE SO EVENLY DIVIDED AS PERFECTLY TO BE DEPENDED UPON IN EVERY LEAF AND TOOTH TO PERHAPS THE TWO THREE OR FOUR THOU SANDTH PART OF AN INCH AND YET ON ACCOUNT OF THE SMALL SCALE OF THOSE MICROMETERS THESE QUANTITIES ARE OF THE GREATEST CONSEQUENCE AN ERROR OF A SINGLE THOUSANDTH PART INDUCING IN MOST INSTRUMENTS A MISTAKE OF SEVERAL SECONDS THE LAST AND GREATEST IMPERFECTION OF ALL IS THAT THESE WIRE MICROMETERS REQUIRE A PRETTY STRONG LIGHT IN THE FIELD OF VIEW AND WHEN I HAD DOUBLE STARS TO MEASURE ONE OF WHICH WAS VERY OBSCURE I WAS OBLIGED TO BE CONTENT WITH LESS LIGHT THAN IS NE CESSARY TO MAKE THE WIRES PERFECTLY DISTINCT AND SEVERAL STARS ON THIS ACCOUNT COULD NOT BE MEASURED AT ALL THOUGH OTHER WISE NOT TOO CLOSE FOR THE MICROMETER THE INSTRUMENT I AM GOING TO DESCRIBE WHICH I CALL A LAMPMICROMETER IS FREE FROM ALL THESE DEFECTS AND HAS MOREOVER TO RECOMMEND IT THE ADVANTAGE OF A VERY ENLARGED SCALE THE CONSTRUCTION OF IT IS AS FOLLOWS ABGCFE FIG 1 IS A STAND NINE FEET HIGH UPON WHICH A SEMICIRCULAR BOARD QHOGP IS MOVEABLE UPWARDS OR DOWNWARDS IN THE MANNER OF SOME FIRESCREENS AS OCCASION MAY REQUIRE AND IS HELD IN ITS SITUATION BY A PEG P PUT INTO ANY ONE OF THE HOLES OF THE UPRIGHT PIECE AB THIS BOARD IS A SEGMENT OF A CIRCLE OF FOURTEEN INCHES RADIUS AND IS ABOUT THREE INCHES BROADER THAN A SEMICIRCLE TO GIVE ROOM FOR THE HANDLES RD EP TO WORK THE USE OF THIS BOARD IS TO CARRY AN ARM L THIRTY INCHES LONG WHICH IS MADE TO MOVE UPON A PIVOT AT THE CENTER OF THE CIRCLE BY MEANS OF A STRING WHICH PASSES IN A GROOVE UPON THE EDGE OF THE SEMICIRCLE PGOHQ THE STRING IS FASTENED TO166 MR HERSCHELS DESCRIPTION OF TO A HOOK AT O NOT EXPRESSED IN THE FIGURE BEING AT THE BACK OF THE ARM L AND PASSING ALONG THE GROOVE FROM OH TO Q IS TURNED OVER A PULLEY AT Q AND GOES DOWN TO A SMALL BARREL E WITHIN THE PLANE OF THE CIRCULAR BOARD WHERE A DOUBLEJOINTED HANDLE EP COMMANDS ITS MOTION BY THIS CONTRIVANCE WE SEE THE ARM L MAY BE LIFTED UP TO ANY ALTITUDE FROM THE HORIZONTAL POSITION TO THE PERPENDICULAR OR BE SUFFERED TO DESCEND BY ITS OWN WEIGHT BELOW THE HORIZONTAL TO THE REVERSE PERPENDICULAR SITUA TION THE WEIGHT OF THE HANDLE P IS SUFFICIENT TO KEEP THE ARM IN ANY GIVEN POSITION BUT IF THE MOTION SHOULD BE TOO EASY A FRICTION SPRING APPLIED TO THE BARREL WILL MODERATE IT AT PLEASURE IN FRONT OF THE ARM L A SMALL SLIDER ABOUT THREE INCHES LONG IS MOVEABLE IN A RABBET FROM THE END L TOWARDS THE CEN TER BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS A STRING IS FASTENED TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE LITTLE SLIDER AND GOES TOWARDS L WHERE IT PASSES ROUND A PULLEY AT M AND RETURNS UNDER THE ARM FROM M N TOWARDS THE CENTER WHERE IT IS LED IN A GROOVE ON THE EDGE OF THE ARM WHICH IS OF A CIRCULAR FORM UPWARDS TO A BARREL RAISED ABOVE THE PLANE OF THE CIRCULAR BOARD AT R TO WHICH THE HANDLE RD IS FASTENED A SECOND STRING IS FASTENED TO THE SLIDER AT THE RIGHT SIDE AND GOES TOWARDS THE CENTER WHERE IT PASSES OVER A PULLEY N AND THE WEIGHT W WHICH IS SUSPENDED BY THE END OF THIS STRING RETURNS THE SLIDER TOWARDS THE CENTER WHEN A CONTRARY TURN OF THE HANDLE PERMITS IT TO ACT A AND B ARE TWO SMALL LAMPS TWO INCHES HIGH 1 12 IN BREADTH BY 1 14 IN DEPTH THE SIDES BACK AND TOP ARE MADE SO AS TO PERMIT NO LIGHT TO BE SEEN AND THE FRONT CONSISTS OF A THIN BRASS SLIDING DOOR THE FLAME IN THE LAMP A IS PLACED THREETENTHS OF AN INCH FROM THE LEFT SIDE THREETENTHS FROM THE FRONT AND HALF AN INCH FROM THE BOTTOM IN THE LAMP B IT IS PLACED AT THEA LAMPMICROMETER 167 THE SAME HEIGHT AND DISTANCE MEASURING FROM THE RIGHT SIDE THE WICK OF THE FLAME CONSISTS ONLY OF A SINGLE VERY THIN LAMP COTTON THREAD FOR THE SMALLEST FLAME BEING SUFFICIENT IT IS EASIER TO KEEP IT BURNING IN SO CONFINED A PLACE IN THE TOP OF EACH LAMP MUST BE A LITTLE SLIT LENGTHWAYS AND ALSO A SMALL OPEN ING IN ONE SIDE NEAR THE UPPER PART TO PERMIT AIR ENOUGH TO CIR CULATE TO FEED THE FLAME TO PREVENT EVERY REFLECTION OF LIGHT THE SIDE OPENING OF THE LAMP A SHOULD BE TO THE RIGHT AND THAT OF THE LAMP B TO THE LEFT IN THE SLIDING DOOR OF EACH LAMP IS MADE A SMALL HOLE WITH THE POINT OF A VERY FINE NEEDLE JUST OP POSITE THE PLACE WHERE THE WICKS ARE BURNING SO THAT WHEN THE SLIDERS ARE SHUT DOWN AND EVERY THING DARK NOTHING SHALL BE SEEN BUT TWO FINE LUCID POINTS OF THE SIZE OF TWO STARS OF THE THIRD OR FOURTH MAGNITUDE THE LAMP A IS PLACED SO THAT ITS LUCID POINT MAY BE IN THE CENTER OF THE CIRCULAR BOARD WHERE IT REMAINS FIXED THE LAMP B IS HUNG TO THE LITTLE SLIDER WHICH MOVES IN THE RAB BET OF THE ARM SO THAT ITS LUCID POINT IN A HORIZONTAL POSITION OF THE ARM MAY BE ON A LEVEL WITH THE IUCID POINT IN THE CEN TER THE MOVEABLE LAMP IS SUSPENDED UPON A PIECE OF BRASS FASTENED TO THE SLIDER BY A PIN EXACTLY BEHIND THE FLAME UPON WHICH IT MOVES AS A PIVOT THE LAMP IS BALANCED AT THE BOTTOM BY A LEADEN WEIGHT SO AS ALWAYS TO REMAIN UPRIGHT WHEN THE ARM IS EITHER LIFTED ABOVE OR DEPRESSED BELOW THE HORIZONTAL POSITION THE DOUBLEJOINTED HANDLES RD EP CONSIST OF LIGHT DEAL RODS TEN FEET LONG AND THE LOWEST OF THEM MAY HAVE DIVI SIONS MARKED UPON IT NEAR THE END P EXPRESSING EXACTLY THE DISTANCE FROM THE CENTRAL LUCID POINT IN FEET INCHES AND TENTHS FROM THIS CONSTRUCTION WE SEE THAT A PERSON AT A DISTANCE OF TEN FEET MAY GOVERN THE TWO LUCID POINTS SO AS TO BRING THEM INTO ANY REQUIRED POSITION SOUTH OR NORTH PRECEDING OR FOLLOWING 7 FROM163 MR HERSCHELS DESCRIPTION OF FROM 0 TO 90 BY USING THE HANDLE P AND ALSO TO ANY DISTANCE FROM SIXTENTHS OF AN INCH TO FIVE OR SIX AND TWENTY INCHES BY MEANS OF THE HANDLE D IF ANY REFLECTION OR APPEARANCE OF LIGHT SHOULD BE LEFT FROM THE TOP OR SIDES OF THE LAMPS A TEMPO RARY SCREEN CONSISTING OF A LONG PIECE OF PASTEBOARD OR A WIRE FRAME COVERED WITH BLACK CLOTH OF THE LENGTH OF THE WHOLE ARM AND OF ANY REQUIRED BREADTH WITH A SLIT OF HALF AN INCH BROAD IN THE MIDDLE MAY BE AFFIXED TO THE ARM BY FOUR BENT WIRES PROJECTING AN INCH OR TWO BEFORE THE LAMPS SITUATED SO THAT THE MOVEABLE LUCID POINT MAY PASS ALONG THE OPENING LEFT FOR THAT PURPOSE FIG 2 REPRESENTS PART OF THE ARM L HALF THE REAL SIZE S THE SLIDER

RIVETTED TO THE BRASS PIECE UPON WHICH IS HELD THE LAMP BY A NUT AND SCREW FIG 3 4 REPRE SENT THE LAMPS A B WITH THE SLIDING DOORS OPEN TO SHEW THE SITUATION OF THE WICKS W IS THE LEADEN WEIGHT WITH A HOLE D IN IT THROUGH WHICH THE WIRE R OF FIG 2 IS TO BE PASSED WHEN THE LAMP IS TO BE FASTENED TO THE SLIDER S FIG 5 REPRE SENTS THE LAMP A WITH THE SLIDING DOOR SHUT L THE LUCID POINT AND IK THE OPENINGS AT THE TOP AND S AT THE SIDES FOR THE AD MISSION OF AIR EVERY INGENIOUS ARTIST WILL SOON PERCEIVE THAT THE MOTIONS OF THIS MICROMETER ARE CAPABLE OF GREAT IMPROVEMENT BY THE APPLI CATION OF WHEELS AND PINIONS AND OTHER WELL KNOWN MECHA NICAL RESOURCES BUT AS THE PRINCIPAL OBJECT IS ONLY TO BE ABLE TO ADJUST THE TWO LUCID POINTS TO THE REQUIRED POSITION AND DIS TANCE AND TO KEEP THEM THERE FOR A FEW MINUTES WHILE THE OBSERVEROF A LAMPMICROMETER 169 OBSERVER GOES TO MEASURE THEIR DISTANCE IT WILL NOT BE NECESSARY TO SAY MORE UPON THE SUBJECT I AM NOW TO SHEW THE APPLICATION OF THIS INSTRUMENT IT IS WELL KNOWN TO OPTICIANS AND OTHERS WHO HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF USING OPTICAL INSTRUMENTS THAT WE CAN WITH ONE EYE LOOK INTO A MICROSCOPE OR TELESCOPE AND SEE AN OBJECT MUCH MAGNIFIED WHILE THE NAKED EYE MAY SEE A SCALE UPON WHICH THE MAGNIFIED PICTURE IS THROWN IN THIS MANNER I HAVE GENERALLY DETERMINED THE POWER OF MY TELESCOPES AND ANY ONE WHO HAS ACQUIRED A FACILITY OF TAKING SUCH OBSERVATIONS WILL VERY SELDOM MISTAKE SO MUCH AS ONE IN FIFTY IN DETERMINING THE POWER OF AN INSTRU MENT AND THAT DEGREE OF EXACTNESS IS FULLY SUFFICIENT FOR THE PURPOSE THE NEWTONIAN FORM IS ADMIRABLY ADAPTED TO THE USE OF THIS MICROMETER FOR THE OBSERVER STANDS ALWAYS ERECT AND LOOKS IN A HORIZONTAL DIRECTION NOTWITHSTANDING THE TELESCOPE SHOULD BE ELEVATED TO THE ZENITH BESIDES HIS FACE BEING TURNED AWAY FROM THE OBJECT TO WHICH HIS TELESCOPE IS DIRECTED THIS MICRO METER MAY BE PLACED VERY CONVENIENTLY WITHOUT CAUSING THE LEAST OBSTRUCTION TO THE VIEW THEREFORE WHEN I USE THIS INSTRU MENT I PUT IT AT TEN FEET DISTANCE FROM THE LEFT EYE IN A LINE PERPENDICULAR TO THE TUBE OF THE TELESCOPE AND RAISE THE MOVE ABLE BOARD TO SUCH A HEIGHT THAT THE LUCID POINT OF THE CENTRAL LAMP MAY BE UPON A LEVEL WITH THE EYE THE HANDLES LIFTED UP ARE PASSED THROUGH TWO LOOPS FASTENED TO THE TUBE JUST BY THE OBSERVER SO AS TO BE READY FOR HIS USE I SHOULD OBSERVE THAT THE END OF THE TUBE IS CUT AWAY SO AS TO LEAVE THE LEFT EYE INTIRELY FREE TO SEE THE WHOLE MICROMETER HAVING NOW DIRECTED THE TELESCOPE TO A DOUBLE STAR I VIEW IT WITH THE RIGHT EYE AND AT THE SAME TIME WITH THE LEFT SEE IT PRO V OL LXXII Z JECTED170 MR HERSCHELS DESCRIPTION OF JECTED UPON THE MICROMETER THEN BY THE HANDLE P WHICH COM MANDS THE POSITION OF THE ARM I RAISE OR DEPRESS IT SO AS TO BRING THE TWO LUCID POINTS TO A SIMILAR SITUATION WITH THE TWO STARS AND BY THE HANDLE D I APPROACH OR REMOVE THE MOVEABLE LUCID POINT TO THE SAME DISTANCE OF THE TWO STARS SO THAT THE TWO LUCID POINTS MAY BE EXACTLY COVERED BY OR COINCIDE WITH THE STARS A LITTLE PRACTICE IN THIS BUSINESS SOON MAKES IT EASY ESPECIALLY TO ONE WHO HAS ALREADY BEEN USED TO LOOK WITH BOTH EYES OPEN WHAT REMAINS TO BE DONE IS VERY SIMPLE WITH A PROPER RULE DIVIDED INTO INCHES AND FORTIETH PARTS I TAKE THE DISTANCE OF THE LUCID POINTS WHICH MAY BE DONE TO THE GREATEST NICETY BECAUSE AS I OBSERVED BEFORE THE LITTLE HOLES ARE MADE WITH THE POINT OF A VERY FINE NEEDLE THE MEASURE THUS OBTAINED IS THE TANGENT OF THE MAGNIFIED ANGLE UNDER WHICH THE STARS ARE SEEN TO A RADIUS OF TEN FEET THEREFORE THE ANGLE BEING FOUND AND DIVIDED BY THE POWER OF THE TELESCOPE GIVES THE REAL ANGULAR DISTANCE OF THE CENTERS OF A DOUBLE STAR FOR INSTANCE SEPTEMBER 25 1781 I MEASURED  HERCULIS WITH THIS INSTRUMENT HAVING CAUSED THE TWO LUCID POINTS TO COINCIDE EXACTLY WITH THE STARS CENTER UPON CENTER I FOUND THE RADIUS OR DISTANCE OF THE CENTRAL LAMP FROM THE EYE 10 FEET 415 INCHES THE TANGENT OR DISTANCE OF THE TWO LUCID POINTS 506 FORTIETH PARTS OF AN INCH THIS GIVES THE MAGNIFIED ANGLE 35 AND DIVIDING BY THE POWER 460 WHICH I USED WE OBTAIN 4 34 FOR THE DISTANCE OF THE CENTERS OF THE TWO STARS THE SCALE OF THE MICROMETER AT THIS VERY CONVENIENT DISTANCE WITH THE POWER OF 460 WHICH MY TELESCOPE BEARS SO WELL UPON THE FIXED STARS THAT FOR NEAR A TWELVEMONTH PAST I HAVE HARDLY USED ANY OTHER IS ABOVE A QUARTER OF AN INCH TO A SECOND AND BY PUTTING ON MY POWER OF 932 WHICH IN VERY FINE EVENINGS IS 1 EXTREMELYA LAMPMICROMETER 171 EXTREMELY DISTINCT I OBTAIN A SCALE OF MORE THAN HALF AN INCH TO A SECOND WITHOUT INCREASING THE DISTANCE OF THE MICROMETER WHEREAS THE MOST PERFECT OF MY FORMER MICROMETERS WITH THE SAME INSTRUMENT HAD A SCALE OF LESS THAN THE TWO THOUSANDTH PART OF AN INCH TO A SECOND THE MEASURES OF THIS MICROMETER ARE NOT CONFINED TO DOUBLE STARS ONLY BUT MAY BE APPLIED TO ANY OTHER OBJECTS THAT REQUIRE THE UTMOST ACCURACY SUCH AS THE DIAMETERS OF THE PLANETS OR THEIR SATELLITES THE MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON THE DIAMETERS OF THE FIXED STARS C FOR INSTANCE OCTOBER 22 1781 I MEASURED THE APPARENT DIAMETER OF  LYRAE AND JUDGING IT OF THE GREATEST IMPOR TANCE TO INCREASE MY SCALE AS MUCH AS CONVENIENT I PLACED THE MICROMETER AT THE GREATEST CONVENIENT DISTANCE AND WITH SOME TROUBLE FOR WANT OF LONGER HANDLES WHICH MIGHT EASILY BE ADDED TOOK THE DIAMETER OF THIS STAR BY REMOVING THE TWO LUCID POINTS TO SUCH A DISTANCE AS JUST TO INCLOSE THE APPARENT DIAMETER WHEN I MEASURED MY RADIUS IT WAS FOUND TO BE TWENTYTWO FEET SIX INCHES THE DISTANCE OF THE TWO LUCID POINTS WAS ABOUT THREE INCHES FOR I WILL NOT PRE TEND TO EXTREME NICETY IN THIS OBSERVATION ON ACCOUNT OF THE VERY GREAT POWER I USED WHICH WAS 6450 FROM THESE MEA SURES WE HAVE THE MAGNIFIED ANGLE 38 10 THIS DIVIDED BY THE POWER GIVES 0 355 FOR THE APPARENT DIAMETER OF  LYRAE THE SCALE OF THE MICROMETER ON THIS OCCASION WAS NO LESS THAN 8443 INCHES TO A SECOND AS WILL BE FOUND BY MULTIPLYING THE NATURAL TANGENT OF A SECOND WITH THE POWER AND RADIUS IN INCHES NOVEMBER 28 1781 I MEASURED THE DIAMETER OF THE NEW STAR BUT THE AIR WAS NOT VERY FAVOURABLE FOR THIS SINGULAR STAR WAS NOT SO DISTINCT WITH 227 THAT EVENING AS IT GENERALLY IS Z 2 WITH172 MR HERSCHELS DESCRIPTION OF A LAMPMICROMETER WITH 460 THEREFORE WITHOUT LAYING MUCH STRESS UPON THE EXACTNESS OF THE OBSERVATION I SHALL ONLY REPORT IT TO EXEMPLIFY THE USE OF THE MICROMETER MY RADIUS WAS 35 FEET 11 INCHES THE DIAMETER OF THE STAR BY THE DISTANCE OF THE LUCID POINTS WAS 24 INCHES AND THE POWER I USED 227 HENCE THE MAGNI FIED ANGLE IS FOUND 19 AND THE

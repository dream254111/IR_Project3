though it is possible that three broods may occur The habit these insects have of hopping into the air on the least disturbance renders them open to direct attack with the  hopperdozer  principle which has been used so exten sively in the contests with the Rocky Mountain Locust XVe have found however that a very simple plan of using this principle is the most effective in securing the leafhop pers It consists in coating the upper surface of a sheet of sheetiron with coal tar attaching cords at either end and also in the centre if it is very long with which to draw it FIG  Agallia sanfguinolenta A larva B pupa C imago and front view of head of imago Original Size lines are a 1ttle too long and then it is drawn over the lawn or pasture at a moderate walk by a boy or man at each end As soon as the sheet becomes covered with hoppers so that all are not held when they strike the pan a new coat of tar is applied On an extensive scale this can be used at a cost of but a few cents per acre and is applicable to large pastures and meadows Upon lawns and pastures the treat ment may be applied at any time when the hoppers appear numerous but in meadows it is not applicable while the grass is in bloom on account of the accumulation of pollen on the sheet In general the best time to apply it is in early May and again if hoppers are present in summer directly after the haycrop has been secured HERBERT OSBORN Ames Iowa ASTRONOMICAL NOTES THE following is an ephemeris for the comet discovered by Denning on Mairch 18 The epoch is for Berlin Midnight RA Dec h m s o April 25 2

Vicarage South Devon about twenty years ago They had been taken from the nest and during the first summer their wings were slightly clipped After this their wings were allowed to grow and they lived at full liberty in the garden They were perfectly tame and would come at call and feed out of the hand would come into the house and in the morning kno3k at the windows to ask for some breakfast In the spring they used to fly away and join their wild companions make their nests and rear a family but when this was over they came back to the garden again fed from the hand and were as tame as ever But the curious thing was that after one or two seasons they brought another jackdaw with themn presumably the young of one of them which was just as tame as themselves although nothing had ever been done to tame it so that it was impossible to tell which were the original favorites and which was the new one Moreover when after a few years one of these jackdaws was accidentally killed another was brought by the other two  A Seaside Laboratory of Natural History in connection with the Leland Stanford Jun University will be opened during the coming summer at Pacific Grove Cal on the Bay of Monterey about halfway between Monterey and the Point of Pines This laboratory will be for the purposes of investigation in the life history of the marine animals and plants of this coast It will be under the direction of Professors Gilbert Jenkins and Campbell of the chairs of zoology physiology and botany respectively It will be open to naturalists and others wishing to make special in vestigations in the anatomy or lifehistory of animals and to teach ers of natural science For further details those interested may apply to any of the directors at Palo Alto Cal  In a discussion on diphtheria published in the British Medi cal Journal for Sept 19 1891 Dr Russell cited several instances in which steam had seemed to be an active factor in the propaga tion of the disease Hot water and steam from a brewery were introduced into some old cesspools and evidently waked into ac tivity germs which if undisturbed would have remained dor mant  A new edition of S Dana Hortons  Silver in

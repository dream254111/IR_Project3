j100276,Michigan Law Review,1274691,The Attaint I,i254504,MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW VOL XV NOVEMBER I916 NO I THE ATTIAINT THE practice of attainting a jury was the method by which for centuries the English law corrected an erroneous finding of fact by the body of men who in course of time came to be called a jury Today this necessary corrective of judicial adminis tration is very inadequately performed by the judge or judges pre siding over the trial The proceeding is now called a motion for a new trial The new trial is inadequate for the reason that it does not as did the attaint substitute a correct verdict for the one given It merely reverses or sets aside the former verdict and restores the party prejudiced to his cause of action or defense as the case may be It wipes out the former trial and requires the whole trial to take place again As a matter of fact the demonstration of a necessity for a new trial ought to carry with it the demonstration of what would be a correct verdict and judgment and to save useless expense that judgment should be entered It is the purpose of this article to explain the history of the proceeding by attaint and to show the long development whereby the English law arrived at the substituted practice of granting a new trial It will appear that the new trial is the logical successor of the attaint and was induced not by any inadequacy in the attaint ing remedy but by a gradual change in the function of the jury This change was a progression from the original idea that the twelve men who assist the court in arriving at facts are the witness es and the only witnesses of the facts to the later conception that a jury is a body who perform the judicial function of hearing the evi dence in open court and from that evidence with the aid of infor mation from the judge as to the law applicable to the facts developed in evidence make up a verdict by applying the law to the evidence as it has been givenMICHIGAN LAW REVIEW During the last two centuries at least and ever since English law yers completely lost touch with the history of the law it has been customary to speak of the attaint as a barbarous and anomalous pro ceeding Thus Chief Justice SHAW one of our greatest judges with all the solemnity of a judicial wiseacre has said of the at taint  This like many anomalies of a like kind    shows how little the true nature and principle of jury trial in its perfection were understood    But these abuses and anomalies have long since passed away and both in Great Britain and in this country the principle of jury trial is well understood But the author of the Mirror of Magistrates2 written late in the reign of Edward I or early in that of Edward II complains in en umerating the various prevalent abuses in the administration of law It is an abuse that writs of attaint are not granted in the chancery without difficulty for the attaint of all false jurors as well in all other actions personal real or mixed as in the petty assizes To this author who is writing in the period from I300 to 1320 the at taint seems to be a very desirable procedure It is easy to understand this apparent contradiction as soon as we ascertain that jury trial as it existed in the early days of the common law and was known to the Mirror was a wholly different proceed ing in theory and in practice from the jury trial that we know and that Chief Justice Shaw had in mind The attaint was as applica ble to former jury trial as it is inapplicable to our system It will appear that the practice was under all the circumstances an effective remedy and that the legal historians have not done justice to a rea sonable proceeding3 The process of attaint is wholly a matter of procedure but legal historians have been compelled to recognize that the historical life of any system of law is found in its procedure To trace the devel opment of English law is emphatically to trace the history of its procedure English law has been called a commentary upon writs To theoretical lawyers the law can very easily be divided between substantive and adjective law But as a matter of fact there is not now and there never has been such a division except as an abstrac 1 Comm v Anthes 5 Gray 185 198 quoted in Thayer Treatise on Evidence 148 2 Mirror of Magistrates Sel Soc I64 3 See I Holdsworth Hist of Eng Iaw I62 I63 to the effect that attaint was a clumsy and never effective remedy but he is simply talking with the disregard of changed conditions that was exhibited by Coke whom he so much admires See Essays in Legal History of 19I3 Oxford p 297 2THE ATTAINT tion Procedure and the available remedies have constantly operated to limit rights and duties If a theoretically assumed and desirable right or duty is not associated with a reasonably adequate remedy such right or duty for all purposes of the practical lawyer does not exist It is also true that actual changes in the substantive law have frequently been stated and necessarily stated in terms of the reme dial law These changes have resulted in two ways one is by legis lation the other is by judicial decision and the practice of courts The tracing of the history of attaint will show both methods in full operation Writers upon law have not been able to say when the proceeding of attaint arose As early as the reign of King John in 1202 it is found as an ordinary practice presupposing an antecedent and set tled existence We can point to no statute or legislation which in stituted it any more than we have been able to find any statute which began the practice in England of adding twelve men to a court to find the facts The obscurity of the beginnings of attaint has led to a dispute as to whether the practice of attaint existed at the common law that is to say existed by custom or was the creature of legisla tion Blackstone4 notices this dispute Coke5 who was generally far astray in his legal history contends that the attaint in all kinds of actions except real actions existed at the common law He says that the reason why it was not given in real actions was that a higher remedy could always be invoked But the reason given is nonsense for when the attaint originated the courts were innocent of any dis tinction between real and personal actions and the action of debt was precisely as real as and was almost covered by the very words of a writ of right for land Both writs stated that the plaintiff was being deforced in the one case of land in the other of a debt Yet Coke is correct in saying that attaints existed at the common law for we can find the original precedent It is a curious fact that the one case which throws light on the beginning of the practice is a case whose importance has not been appreciated in this connection either by Coke Blackstone Reeves Thayer Pollock and Maitland or Holdsworth It will appear that as is usual in such matters the dispute as to origin is about the meaning of words not facts It arises from not defining what is meant by existing at the common law The fact is evident that the 43 Commentaries 403 2 Inst 130 237 Reeves 2 Hist of Eng Iaw 33 Finlasons ed denies Cokes assertion Both of them are wrong if they are speaking of the same thing which is doubtful 3MICHIGAN LAW REVIEWI practice of attaint namely the reversal of a verdict of twelve men with the punishment of the twelve by another body of men arriving at a different verdict is the creature of the common customary law while the sphere of its operation and the actions in which it could be invoked although originally defined by the common law came through accidental circumstances to be defined wholly by legislation But in the sense that the action of debt the writ of right the writs of entry the use of a jury exist at the common law the practice of attaint was given and provided by the common law without the aid of any statute whatever The case that I have referred to is found in Bigelows Placita AngloNormannica where it has been extracted from the monkish writings called Anglia Sacra Sometime within a few years after 1072 which was only six years from the Norman Conquest a dis pute arose between Pichot the kings sheriff in Kent and Bishop Gundulf of the see of Rochester The Bishop claimed lands as the property of his diocese the sheriff had taken possession of them as belonging to the king The issue no doubt was whether when William the Norman conquered the realm those lands were owned and enjoyed by the church or by some AngloSaxon thane who had been in Harolds army Perhaps too the sheriff was ready to con sider an AngloSaxon bishop as not entitled to hold lands against the king But the Bishop with the power of the church behind him was a different being from a Saxon landholder He brought an action against the sheriff claiming that the latter was deforcing him The king ready to do justice even against himself issued his writ commanding that all the men of that county should be assembled and by their judgment it should be proven probaretur to whom the land really belonged The writ designated Odo Bishop of Bayeux to preside over the court His none too faithful portrait is still to be seen on the Bayeux tapestry where he appears upon his charger but in the wholly unclerical attitude of leading his Norman Knights at the Battle of Hastings The words of this account will repay close examination But first a word is to be said regarding the judge designated to preside The Bishop of Bayeux in Normandy was William the Normans half brother who at this time was the kings chief justiciar and a great territorial magnate in Kent To his elder brother in the contests with his nobles and with the King of France this younger brother had lent valiant aid He had come to the muster for the invasion 6p 34 4THE ATTAINT of England with forty ships and many knights At Hastings he led his knights in battle though the Bayeux tapestry out of defer ence to his priestly character puts in his hand a baculus or baton a somewhat incongruous weapon to supplement his full armor and his armored warhorse He was rewarded with many lordships in Kent of the dispossessed Saxons and from I072 to I079 when this case occurred he was chief justiciar During the kings absence in Nor mandy he was practically regent of the kingdom In his judicial capacity of chief justiciar capitalis justiciarius he presided over the court By the men of the county who were to be assembled to make proof in court we are to understand those freeholders who in Anglo Saxon days had assembled as the shire moot or county court But in this case and thus early after the Conquest we note a change in the function of the men assembled in the county court The Anglo Saxons who made up the court under Edward the Confessor ren dered the judgments in their language they were doomsmen and spoke the doom But by this writ they are only to prove pro baretur to be witnesses to inform the kings justiciar who is to render the judgment This conception of the function of jurors remains today after the lapse of many centuries the true conception of the jury Just as formerly as witnesses now as judicial officers they find the facts so that upon their finding the judge of the court may enter the proper judgment but the judgment is the adjudica tion of the judge not of the jury The county court was assembled in pursuance of the writ the chief justiciar presiding but in fear of the kings sheriff the men of the county said that the land was the kings The story proceeds that since the Bishop of Bayeux the presiding judge did not believe what they said he directed the county court if they really knew what they said to be true to select twelve of their number to con firm upon oath what the whole body of the court had said It will be noticed that here is probably the first instance in English legal history of twelve sworn men being selected in a court to make a conclusive statement of facts upon which the judge is to act in rendering a judgment7 These twelve men were selected they withdrew to consult but they too were greatly terrified by a message from the sheriff and came back and swore that what the county court said was true and thereupon it may be inferred judgment was 7 It is not questioned that the royal inquest of twelve was commonly used in the Domesday Survey but those were not judicial proceedings but rather administrative If the Survey began in 1085 which is not likely this case antedates Domesday 5MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW given against the Bishop of Rochester for the land remained to the king8 This case even if it went only so far would be instructive on the changes in judicial administration initiated by King William but the monkish chronicler with peculiar unction goes on to tell us that a certain monk now came forward and showed to the Bishop of Roch ester that the verdict was unquestionably wrong and that one of the men of the twelve knew it to be so for he held his own lands under the title of the church The bishop took the monk to the chief jus ticiar who heard the statement The bare details of the account do not show us the Normans wrath at learning that despite his better judgment he had allowed himself to be imposed upon and the church to be robbed of its lands by the false words of a lot of Saxon churls but there is the scene of his bringing one of the twelve before him and of the man in fright throwing himself at the justiciars feet and confessing that he was a perjurer Then another of the twelve was called in and confessed The rest of the twelve were brought be fore the chief justiciar and he convened many of the greater barons of England They both French and English having heard the mat ter adjudged the jury to have been perjured and to have made a false oath It is at this point that the Normans practical sense enabled him to invent the attaint No doubt precedents and practice existed in Normandy for convicting of false swearing a royal inquest of twelve men but it was unheard of that a solemn judgment entered on the false oath could be set aside and a contrary judgment made9 Pos sibly if it had been in Normandy the chief justiciar could not have done what he did but he unhesitatingly reversed the former judg ment and gave another whereby Gundulph of Rochester received the lands and the jury were fined three hundred pounds to the king The above we may safely assume is the original precedent for the practice of attaint Here we have it in all its essential features The procedure is more effective than a new trial Instead of stop ping with the restoration of the cause of action ab integro attaint goes further and enters the verdict that the former body should have rendered But it is not to be thought that at that early day the at 8 Sed cum illis Baiocensis episcopus qui placito praeerat non bene crederet prae cipit ut si verum esse quod dicebant scirent ex seipsis duodecim elegerent qui quod omnes dixerant jurejurando confirmarent Illi autem cum ad consilium secessissent et inibi a vicecomite per internuntiam conterriti fuissent revertentes verum esse quod dixerant juraverunt Quo facto terra in manu regis renansit 9 See Thayer Treat Evid 141 to the effect that the attaint was unknown in Nor mandy 6THE ATTAINT taint was so called Even two hundred years later the attaint is called in the Latin of Bracton by the orthodox Latin word convictio or conviction But somewhere about the time of Bracton in the French used as the language of the courts the proceeding was called ateinte The latin writers of the court records gradually gave up their word convictio but in striving to make ateinte a Latin word they fell into the error of mixing ateindre to strike or to at tack with atteindre which means to stain and the word attincta a staining emerged for the Latin of ateinte and thus today our word attaint both in spelling and meaning perpetuates the error of the scribes but men who were capable of translating the English fresh force into frisca forcia were not likely to be intimidated by a simple word like ateinte We may however confidently assert that this could not have been a solitary instance and that there was enough of subsequent prece dent to keep this proceeding alive This must be so since a hundred years later we find the proceeding in existence ready to be applied to the new remedies of novel disseisin and the other three petty assizes But before we leave the Bishop of Bayeux we ought to think of the debt of English law to this hard fighting and adventur ous Norman The full application of the remedy of giving the cor rect judgment despite the former judgment was a new device in vented on the spot His practical sense of justice saw the futility of convicting the jurors while leaving the unrighteous judgment in effect It may be that his Norman sense of justice according to lawthat admirable attribute unknown among the townmeeting courts of the AngloSaxonswas stimulated by the churchmans zeal for his church but he devised a practice that for five hundred years was to rule the English law So much ought to be said for this long forgotten man whose restless spirit led him to prepare a few years later to go to Rome to purchase the papacy But whether he died at Palermo or at the siege of Antioch as an exile or as a warrior for the tomb of Christ English law owes to him the inven tion of the remedy of attaint During the long reign of Henry I the Conquerors son when the kings justices were making their perambulations of the country and sitting in the country court or hearing cases in the exchequer they used in some instances the same procedure of finding by the oath of twelve men what were the facts in a controversy It must be taken as certain that the kings justices made the judgments wher ever they were present in court We may suppose that in some cases the proceeding of attaint was used for dishonesty and perjury un 7MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW happily belong to every age No doubt these activities of the kings justices and it may be attaints added to the cry that went up under Henry I for the restoration of the good old laws of Edward the Con fessor absurd as they were and for the freeitig of the popular courts from the domination of the kings justices But after II36 a civil war ensued between the adherents of Matilda and Stephen with a consequent interruption of regular government Probably the insti tution of the petty and grand assizes to settle conflicting claims to land would have come earlier had the orderly development of An gloNorman law not been interrupted by the civil war It was but twelve years after Henry II Matildas son was in un disputed possession of the crown that the Assize of Clarendon was enacted That enactment adopted the body of twelve men as the in dispensable adjunct to the trial of rights to the possession of land But there was nothing new in the adoption of this expedient the main point was that practically all litigation about land ownership was drawn into the kings courts presided over by the kings jus tices and there followed the consequent division of the realm into circuits and the regular procession of the kings justices for the hearings upon writs of assize In the year I I66 a sitting of the great council of the realm which was then its legislative body for a parliament of king lords and commons was almost a hundred years in the future was held at Clarendon The words of the enactment have not been preserved but from it dates by a mere invention in procedure in fixing the words of a writ the long recognized distinction in the substantive law between title and seisin The writ stated that since A had com plained that B unjustly and without judgment had disseised A of certain lands the sheriff was enjoined to summon twelve free and lawful men of the vicinage to cause them to view the land and to cause them with B to come before the justices to make recognition to give knowledge thereof Thus the twelve selected by the sher iff were to come before the justices and answer the question as the sole witnesses of the fact was A seized and did B disseise him un justly and without judgment This writ called novel disseisin was afterwards supplemented by another writ called mort dancester where the twelve answered the question was As father mother or uncle seized at his death and is A his next heir The writ of ael extended this remedy to the seisin of As grandfather or grandmother the writ of bisael to the seisin of the great grandfather and the writ of cosinage to that of any collateral relative of whom A claimed to be heir The rem 8THE ATTAINT edies covered not only the seisin of land but every right growing out of or connected with seisin The question of the important right to present a parson to a church was covered by the assize of darrein presentment where the question formulated in the writ was who last presented a parson to the church now vacant The im portant question of disputes between laymen and ecclesiastics as to the ownership of land was to be determined by the assize utrum where twelve men answered the question whether utrum the land was ecclesiastical or lay fee0 It is not relevant here that the latter was in its origin subsidiary to another litigation Bracton in his treatise long ago recognized that the word assize had three different meanings A little more analysis would have shown him twice as many When the phrase Assize of Clarendon is used it means the legislation enacted at Clarendon but still older was its meaning of a sitting of the great council at some particular place In course of time the new remedy was called an assize and so it is used in the phrases assize of mort dancester or of darrein presentment Then the writ itself was called the assize or the twelve who were summoned were an assize and finally the court was called an assize and the session of the court from day to day to take the assizes was called the assizes so today when the judges proceed through the counties to hear the trials upon writs of nisi prius the sittings are called the assizes But it may be said that in the case of the Bishop v the Sheriff there wa3 a plain showing of misconduct in the party as well as in the jury and that the practice of attaint does not discriminate be tween misconduct of a party or the jury whether intimidation brib ery or other improper influencing of the jury be used and a case of merely mistaken judgment on the part of the jury There is a dif ference between wilful and corrupt perjury and bad judgment but it is a difference in motive in intention and in mental process The person injured by the incorrect verdict is just as much injured by a merely mistaken verdict against him as he is by a corrupt one The mediaeval mind did not much concern itself with trying to search into the workings of the human heart If a jury found for a man on any insufficient ground they looked to results and very properly so Even today where juries almost invariably find against the employer in favor of the employee on wholly insufficient grounds merely because one can better afford to pay than the other can afford to lose their conduct is just as flagitious in its legal effect as if they 10 These different writs may he found in Glanville and reprinted from there in i Holdsworth Hist Eng Law 423 9MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW had been bribed Morally there is no difference between the motive of finding for a man because he is poor and the motive of finding for a man because he is powerful or a friend or has paid money Bracton however notices that there is a difference between a false verdict and one that is merely fatuous or ignorant and says that by the discretion of the judges the punishment by fine may be made to suit the occasion1 But generally speaking to the men of that age there was in fact little difference in incorrect verdicts The jury or assize were witnesses sworn to tell the truth to give a verdict a true saying verum dictum to the court The staple of litigation was simple in the sense that it was mainly concerning land The facts as to deeds or livery of seisin or as to services owed for lands the status of individuals rights of common occupation of land rents growing out of land mill rights the transfers or sales of prop erty the ownership of property whether real or personal the boun daries of a mans land the members of his family facts as to mar riage and birth of children were bound to be known through the countryside It was assumed that a man called upon an assize or jury would have little difficulty in informing himself of the facts and there were bound to be some on the jury who would know them Life was simple transactions were not involved simple contracts were unknown a mans affairs were talked over by his neighbors and if a recognitor did not tell the truth as to his neighbor to the court when he was called it was from some improper motive To the early mediaeval mind there was little difference between a cor rupt verdict and an incorrect one This at any rate was the theory and it seems reasonable But this emphasizes the witnessing char acter of the jury just as does the form of their oath to tell the truth a tout atrench outright as Sharshulle says in a case to be cited Today the oath recognizing the jury to be judges is in a different form The Norman lawyers made the distinction in the case of the judges Although they began with the idea that error was a proceeding against a judge it soon changed its character But this idea could not apply to witnesses who spoke to the facts which they were supposed to know because happening in the neigh borhood Hence the constant insistence upon a jury from the vicin age and the strictness as to the venue of actions Singularly enough after the matter of vicinage has become a mere sound when a very little prior knowledge is a disqualification for service upon a jury when a jury is expected to decide only from evidence heard in court when a jury not of the vicinage would 1 Bracton 288b 289 292b IOTHE ATTAINT seem to be a more suitable tribunal we are found blindly insisting on the ancient and then reasonable but now absurd requirement of a jury of the vicinage It is an instance of popular fatuity compared with which the demand under the Norman kings for a return to wager of law to the ordeal and to wer wite and bot and to the hap hazard county and hundred courts was comparative wisdom and wholly inexplicable until we reflect that underlying both demands is the desire to perpetuate in the courts that popular element that obedience to public opinion or popular pressure which in ancient Greece left a mans life liberty or property at the mercy of the un restrained vagaries of a majority of the Athenian dicasts which now insists that the judge must give the jury no advice as to the facts which has made our judges elective in the hope that they will be the more responsive to popular ideas and which never has been and probably never will be capable of arriving at that highest attribute of humanity justice in accordance with law Premising therefore that the lawyers under Henry II were cor rect in assuming that a verdict false in fact was equivalent to a case of wilful deception let us return to the Assize of Clarendon of i66 and the supplementary Assize of Northampton some years later It is not difficult to understand that after the Civil War and as soon as Henry II found himself ruling a peaceful realm the pressing neces sity in the administration of justice as it was presented to that ablest of the Angevin kings was to find a remedy to settle with despatch the titles to land and rights connected therewith The new remedy of novel disseisin was of that character The writ issued at the be ginning formulated the sole issue called for no pleadings and no evidence except that of the sworn twelve Theoretically it was summary It went as a matter of course the sheriff summoned the twelve along with the defendant the twelve answered the question in dispute whether the defendant came or not and thereupon judg ment was entered It was called a novel or new disseisin because a limitation was fixed By this assize with the others the four men tioned above called petty assizes only questions of seisin and pos session were to be determined while any higher right was to be tried by a grand assize or a jury of twelve who must be knights men of substance and standing of high station selected not by the sheriff but by four other knights or as an alternative to the grand assize the defendant at his option could demand trial by battle Upon this foundation began that work which is called judicial leg islation but which more properly defined is the work of the courts to render the uncouth products of legislation reasonable and just in IIMICHIGAN LAW REVIEW actual practice No remedy in its actual application turns out as anticipated The legislator assumes the burden of prophecy and it is the work of the courts to make the prophecy come true The writ of novel disseisin is to be returned into a court before the kings justices Naturally the first thing to be done is for the court to ascertain what the dispute is about The claimant states what he claims by means of his countor or lawyer and then the disseisor states what he claims The writ has proposed the question Did B disseise A unjustly and without judgment It may very well be that B disseised A but that he did it with just reason How far can one go in justifying a disseisin and what will the court permit to be tried in the possessory action The courts as usual compromised By means of a pleading called an exception borrowed from the Ro man Law through the Canon Law they permitted the defendant to plead matter of law or fact against the claimants recovery upon the inquiry by the court if the defendant had anything to say why the assize should not be taken Questions were bound to arise not in volving the disseisin These questions the court might be able to decide or if the facts were disputed the assize present could be called upon to decide them and this was called turning the assize into a jurata or jury In many cases the assize would render a special verdict stating the facts found without passing upon the ultimate fact of just or unjust disseisin Thus began that long contest be tween an actual seisin and a better title which fills so large a place in our law with the further question as to how far a finding on the seisin precluded one from claiming by a higher right than seisin But however the issue arrived at was finally put before the assize the question was bound to come what was to be done when the as size returned the verdict and the party prejudiced by it claimed that the verdict was untrue in fact To us where all the evidence is heard in open court no difficulty is presented The judge has heard the evidence as well as the jury and he can say and he can investi gate improper influences But then there was no evidence or wit nesses heard the assize spoke of its own collected knowledge and the judge knew nothing of the facts No legislative provision has been found concerning any proceed ing to set aside or reverse the verdict verun dictum of the assize Glanville of about II87 a contemporary authority says nothing of any provision for attainting a verdict in a petty assize yet soon after the institution of the petty assizes it is found as early as I202 that the process of attaint is well settled its procedure fixed and it has been apparently along used remedy The silence of Glanville is almost 12THE ATTAINT conclusive in favor of the supposed fact that no provision for at tainting a petty assize was contained in the Assize of Clarendon Yet somewhere and in some way the courts had provided a jury of twentyfour knights to attaint the verdict of the assize The diffi culty is to ascertain whence came the provision for such a revising jury as an assize of twentyfour knights As noted before the pro cedure of using twelve men as witnesses to the facts was not new nor was the practice of attainting the twelve by another set of men a new device It may be in spite of Glanvilles silence that the As size of Clarendon did provide for the attainting of an ordinary assize by a verdict of twentyfour knights But it is too violent an assump tion to infer that an attaint was provided by legislation regarding the petty assizes The reasonable conclusion seems to be this Perjury or what was the same thing a false verdict by a petty assize was an offence against the kings justice The number of twentyfour would nat urally be taken as double that of the assize and as corresponding to a grand jury of accusation Knights were selected as of greater standing and importance than ordinary recognitors But all this was worked out as a judicial remedy by judicial practice alone so far as we can see On the available evidence we are compelled to say that the remedy of attaint was provided for the petty assizes by the custom of the courts and hence exists at the common law Singularly enough though Glanville makes no mention of the conzictio or attaint of the petty recognitors he does make the re markable statement in the midst of his description of the grand assize on the writ of right that a punishment of those who swear rashly in this assize is ordained and very fittingly inserted in this royal institution2 These words have been considered to mean that there was a punishment for a false swearing imposed upon the rec ognitors in the grand assize But even if that were true it would not amount to the attaint for the text of Glanville in the preceding chapter is clear to the fact that there is no way in which to attack 12 Glanville Book 2 cap I9 Pena autem in hac assisa temere jurantium ordinaria est et ipsi regali institutioni eleganter inserta This is a curious phrase The swear ing boldly or rashly does not sound like Glanville nor does the eleganter inserta The easy way out of the difficulty is to conclude that this is Hubert Walters work and that he did not know what he was writing about It would not be the first time that legal authors have been found in such a predicament To one who understands that age the supposition that Norman knights would submit to the attaint is unthink able They had insisted upon trial by battle as to the ultimate right in land They could defend themselves by it against criminal accusations and it is not likely they would submit to a charge of false swearing without a right to appeal to the duel An edition of Glanville in the light of our present knowledge is greatly to be desired 13MAICHIGAN LAW REVIEW the verdict of the grand assize That was always a finality and the essence of the attaint is that the verdict attacked is not a finality It is not likely that an attaint would be applied to a verdict of a grand assize when it could not be applied to the alternative duel nor is it likely that the same process would be applied to a jury of knights as was applied to a petty assize It is unbelievable that Norman knights at that time who could defend against a crime by the battle would submit to be attainted by a verdict of twentyfour knights As a matter of fact the attaint never was applied to the grand assize The context in Glanville is followed by the description of the punishment for false oath in a petty assize It may be that he is confusing the grand assize and petty assizel3 On the other hand it is possible though not probable that the Assize of Clarendon may have provided for a conviction for false swearing by a jury of twentyfour knights whether the assize was a grand or petty assize and the courts seeing the difficulty of finding the false oath without reversing the finding may have applied the process to the petty assize but not to the grand assize If so there was a provision in the Assize of Clarendon for the attaint of the petty assize but this would in no way invalidate the conclusion that attaint existed at the common law At any rate there is no question but that the conviction and punishment for a false oath was never as a matter of practice applied to the grand assize The only instance known where it was asked for as against a grand assize is in Bractons Note Book in a case dating from I22714 A grand assize upon a writ of right of advowson to determine who had the better right to present a parson to the church of Wester ham the Prior of le Waste or Thomas de Camville said that Thomas had the better right because they never saw that the Prior or any of his predecessors had presented a priest to that church But there upon came the Prior and said that the grand assize swore incorrectly male15 and he pleaded deeds showing a grant of this advowson 13 If we may suppose that Hubert Walter wrote the treatise called Glanville we could conclude that he being not conversant with the practice of the courts but know ing that the proceeding for attaint was applied to the petty assize supposed that it was provided for in the Assize of Clarendon and hastily assumed that it applied to the grand assize This is piling one possibility upon another in a way forbidden by the land law as understood by Coke who rejects a possibility upon a possibility 14 Bractons Note Book Case No 26I 15 It may be noted that the Prior does not dare to allege a false oath in the usual words of the allegation but contents himself with using the euphemistic word male to gloze over his charge The very fact that the word male badly is used lends some countenance to the supposition that an allegation of false oath against a grand assize I4THE ATTAINT to his predecessor and anotherwriting showing an induction by the Bishop of Rochester of a priest presented by the Prior and monks of le Waste Thomas very wisely declined to answer to the deeds as they were res inter alios but prayed judgment on the verdict The case was adjourned in order to consult the king and afterwards another adjournment was taken No doubt the matter was thor oughly canvassed in the officina brevium to see if the king ought to issue the writ The result was that on the date to which the last adjournment had been taken the Prior knowing he could get no writ came not Thomas was quit of the charge of a false verdict and had judgment There are opposite this case in what is probably Bractons handwriting the words Note that the grand assize is not easily convicted i e attainted Bracton wrote his treatise from the cases in his Note Book and he lays it down as undoubted law that no attaint convictio lies upon the verdict of a grand assize16 This authority remained unbroken In the year I292 thirty years later than Bractons treatise the re port states it for settled law that the attaint does not lie on the ver dict of a grand assize17 Bracton in speaking of the attaint applies it to the petty assizes and does not suggest or seem to know of any legislative sanction for it According to him the attaint came by the common law There remains however the verdict of the attainting jury itself Was their decision a finality One would expect the answer to be in the affirmative from reasonable men No suggestion is heard that it is not and in the Year Book1 two centuries afterward in the reign of Henry IV it is stated that no attaint lies upon the ver dict of the twentyfour attainting jurors on any matter for which the twelve have been attainted This must have been the rule for if the verdict of the twentyfour found in the same way as the twelve the issue would have been confirmed by two separate juries amount ing to thirtysix men It is not conceivable that the two verdicts would be allowed to be attacked Yet in a Year Book in the reign of Henry VI19 it is laid down that if the attainting jury finds upon some collateral matter ie some fact or issue not found or passed upon by the jury of twelve their verdict upon that particular mat was utterly unknown As powerful a personage as a prior would be certain to use an available remedy yet his guarded language shows that he may have anticipated a duel with every knight on the grand assize  Bracton De Legibus 290 296b 17 Y B 202I Edw I Rolls Ser I8 1Y B 8 Henry IV f 23b 9 Y B

probably a mere flourish As we have seen the only contemporaneous evidence as to the attaint is silent on the subject of its origin The first published case after II66 which refers to the attaint is in the Select Civil Pleas20 The record of a case at that time seems to have been en tered carelessly The date of the case is 1202 in the reign of King John thirtysix years after the Assize of Clarendon The entry is to the effect that an assize of novel disseisin returned a verdict against Fulcmar de Barton Simon de Kyme the bailiff of Fulc mar offered the king twenty shillings for a jury of twentyfour knights to convict the assize of a false oath But his offer was not accepted for Simon was not the attorney of Fulcmar to win or lose ad lucrandum vcl perdendum that is to say as bailiff he had no authority by a sufficient power of attorney to bind his principal This case seems to indicate that the attaint was then well known the number of the jury and the character of the jurors was fixed but it also indicates that the granting of the writ was discretionary with the king Thus thirtysix years after the Assize of Clarendon it was not known that there was any legislative provision giving the writ of attaint in regard to a petty assizes verdict It seems con clusive against any other inference than that the attaint existed at the common law but was grantable in the discretion of the king not as a matter of course The fact that it was grantable in discretion points to its customary origin In the same book in the same year 1202 is an instance21 of an attaint upon the strength of a judicial record and a confession of the jury attainted without the intervention of the jury of twentyfour knights The assize had found against a disseisin alleged to have been unjust and without judgment because as the assize said the disseisor entered and took possession in pursuance of a judgment of the Court of the City of London The assize had probably stated that there was such a judgment without a record produced The Kings Court probably did not enter judgment but called for the record The London court returned that it had made no such judg ment but that the action referred to concerned services The assize admitted this and they were at once convicted of perjury by the matter of record and remanded to custody 20 Select Civil Pleas Sel Soc case No 224 p 90 See also case

for cases of attaint is Bractons Note Book containing cases twentyfive years later than 1202 although Bractons treatise belongs to the period of about I260 Bracton with the average lawyers distrust of the capacity of judges that he knew went back for his law to the days of the great Pateshull and Raleigh By this time it appears that the rec ords are more carefully kept but they have not yet assumed cer tainty of form they are in Iatin and no French is found in them There are a number of cases of attaint or as it was then called convictio A case may be taken where the attaint was successful22 Philip de Kyme complained that the recognitors of the assize of novel disseisin summoned and taken before the justices last itiner ant in the County of Lincoln had made a false oath as to a right of common by returning a verdict against his deceased father The cause of action for attaint as we would say had descended to him as heir and the exact issue was whether a part of a marsh described by metes and bounds was in the manor of North Kyme or in the manor of Billinghay The jury of twelve had found that the Prior of Cattele was seized of the whole manor of Billinghay where the marsh was and that Philips father had no right of common therein The Prior appeared and said in effect that there had been a mis trial that the assize had passed upon the freehold and no freehold was claimed but only a common The verdict of course was wrong as giving more than the Prior claimed and the record recites that since the twelve jurors gave to the Prior seisin of a freehold which was not claimed it was adjudged that the twelve jurors be in mercy as if convicted Thereupon the jury of twentyfour knights passed upon the question at issue as to where the marsh was and the right of common They found to the contrary of the assize There fore it was adjudged that the twelve be convicted that Philip re cover seisin of his common of pasture and the twelve men be re manded to prison until the courts further order The practice seems plain Although it is apparent that the judg ment on the verdict is incorrect and will be set aside nevertheless the attainting jury passes on the issue that had been before the as size and upon this verdict of the twentyfour a new judgment is entered The next case23 to be noted is one where the men on the assize found themselves in a perilous predicament An assize called to de 22Bractons Note Book case No 174 23 Bractons Note Book case No 285 There were others with Hugo but the phrase is omitted above I7MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW termine whether certain land in Wycombe was lay fee of Hugo or ecclesiastical land held in free alms frankalmoigne or libera ele mosina by the Chapel of Wallingford an assize utrum had found in favor of the parson of the chapel Hugo brought attaint assign ing a false oath in the recognitors The jury of twentyfour came to recognize the fact and the parson now defendant in the attaint came and conceded the land to be IIugos to hold as he had it be fore the verdict in assize But the jury of twelve told a harrowing tale They said that they were compelled by the justices itinerant to say that the land was free alms of the chapel and that one who pleaded for them before the justices was taken and imprisoned and they said that they well knew that they had sworn falsely and they put themselves in mercy The twentyfour knights said that the land was Hugos and they fixed the damages for his dispossession on the judgment The record is silent as to what was done to the jurors or the justices itinerant But it is to be noted that justices itinerant were at this time frequently knights not justices of the kings court as will appear from later cases to be cited In another case24 a great personage Villiam Fitz Peter Earl of Essex son of the great justiciar Geoffrey Fitz Peter complained of a verdict in a novel disseisin against him given in favor of John de Lascelles The facts as found specially by the jury of twelve were that William came into possession of the land as heir of Earl Conan and held the land for a month or more in peaceful seisin but then came a certain Jew and showed that the land was mortgaged vadi um to him by Earl Conan for twentyfour pounds and deeded to him that the Jew had brought a writ of the sheriff giving him seisin of the mortgaged land and upon it having been put into possession the Jew had demised the land to John de Lascelles The jury of twentyfour knights said the same and therefore both the twelve and the twentyfour found that John de Lascelles did not disseise the said Earl of Essex unjustly and without judgment The next case25 to be noted begins with a praecipe instructing the sheriff to command four knights to make a record of an assize of novel disseisin that had been taken in their presence The knights had been justices itinerant but had returned no record The record was made and produced to the effect that the assize had found for the defendants Upon this record the plaintiff alleged a false oath in the assize because he said he held the land as tenant by the curtesy as land of his wife under whom the defendants claimed and 24 Bractons Note Book case No 30ITHE ATTAINT that he had had children by his wife The defendants admitted this fact as did the assize and on the undisputed facts the assize were convicted of a false oath the claimant recovered the land and his damages from the defendants and the jury paid a fine of fifty marks Here it is plain that the knights presiding did not know enough law to inform the jury of the estate by the curtesy but the fine is small to the jurors on that account Another praecipe2 required Simon de Roppeley and his associate justices to return their record in a novel disseisin which Lambert had brought against Jollan where the assize had found for Lam bert Upon the return of the record Jollan assigned a false oath in the assize The twentyfour jurors said that the facts were that Lambert was an illegitimate son of an elder Lambert The father had given his bastard son certain land but had remained in seisin and had died seised and thereupon the legitimate son Jollan as heir evicted Lambert And so they said that Lambert was never in seisin to be disseised Jollan recovered seisin and the jury went to prison This is an old case of a grantor remaining in possession In modern law the delivery requisite is of the deed but in mediaeval law the question was on livery of seisin But here we begin to see the troubles of a jury The four knights probably could not tell them the law they naturally tried as a jury will do to help the one who had nothing and found themselves in prison for the English law has never dealt kindly with illegitimates Still another case27 shows an entry for condition broken Robert had disseised Richard and the assize found in Richards favor but the twentyfour said that Robert had given the land to Richard on condition that Richard marry his daughter and Richard did not mar ry her whereupon Robert had entered but did not disseise Richard who had never had seisin The note to this case says that a certain man who gave land to another could disseise him for breach of the condition but if this is Bractons note he missed the point The legal conclusion in the attaint verdict is that the grantee was not in seisin at all until he performed the condition Bracton makes the condition subsequent but the jury made it precedent These cases show that the attaint is an effective remedy No case appears where it is applied to any other sort of verdict than that of an assize In actions where there was no jury as for instance in debt or detinue there was no room for its application since the old 25 Bractons Note Book case No 917 26 Bractons Note Book case

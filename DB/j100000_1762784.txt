dlanger and damage have been avoided by using oil to prevent heavy seas from breaking on board It will be remembered that on the Pilot Chart for last March a full explanation was pub lished with diagrams as to the best methods of using oil Re prints of this explanation and accompanying diagrams can be obtained at any branch hydrographic office There are many other cases where oil may be used to advantage such as lowering and hoisting boats riding to a seaanchor cross ing rollers or surf on a bar and from lifeboats and stranded vessels Thick and heavy oils are the best Mineral oils are not so effective as animal or vegetable oils Raw petroleum has given favorable results but not so good when it is refined Certain oils like cocoanutoil and some kinds of fishoil congeal in cold weather and are therefore useless but may be mixed with mineral oils to advantage The simplest and best method of distributing oil is by means of canvas bags about one foot long filled with oakum and oil pierced with holes by means of a coarse sailneedle and held by a lanyard The wastepipes forward are also very useful for this purpose In addition to the reports published last month from vessels that used oil during the St ThomasHatteras hurricane of Sept 3I2 the following have been received by the United States Hydro graphic Office from vessels that encountered the same storm  The British steamship  Elgiva Capt Bermpohl Sept 4 when in latitude 24 north longitude 65 west kept oilbags at bows and channels to prevent seas from coming on board The oil had a remarkable effect in smoothing the seas and the vessel sustained no damage whatever The British brigantine Victoria Capt Simmons in a terrific hurricane Sept 5 latitude 26 north longi tude 68 38 west lost spars sails etc A quantity of codoil was used and it is thought that it saved the ships hull from damage and possibly total loss The American brig  Mary Bartlett Capt Holmes Sept 8 latitude 360 42 north longitude 74Q 22 west commenced using oil paint and kerosene mixed On Sept 9 the wind northeast and blowing in terrific squalls oil was used with great success The British brig  J A Horsey  Capt Dow ling in a hurricane off capes of the Chesapeake Sept 912 used keroseneoil but without as great success as if it had been a heavier oil of which there was none on board The American schooner  Ralph M Haywood Capt Baxter in a hurricane off capes of the Chesapeake Sept 9II used axleoil in bags hung over the weather bow The bags were replenished every two hours in all about five gallons being used and with great success The Italian bark  Biagino Capt Brignati encountered the hurricane Sept 9I2 after leaving the Delaware Breakwater for Cagliari The cargo was petroleum and as the vessel leaked badly a large amount of the oil was pumped out As stated above a thin oil like refined petroleum has but little effect and such was the case in this instance The British steamship Claribel Capt Macknight encountered the hurricane Sept 9I I between latitude 37 north longitude 73Q west and latitude 34Q north longitude 7I west Oil was used with success and prevented many a heavy sea from breaking over the vessel MENTAL SCIENCE Experiments in CrystalVision THERE is a general tendency whenever a notion is relegated to the rank of superstitions to regard all interest in the matter as end ing there Such an attitude neglects to distinguish between error founded upon a false observation of facts and error founded upon a false interpretation of facts it neglects to consider as well that the origin of this superstition also needs explanation A supersti tion is rarely a purely fanciful notion spun from the inner con sciousness but usually contains though often in a scarcely recog nizable form an element of interesting and perhaps important knowledge It is with a full appreciation of this latter point of view that an anonymous lady writes in the recently issued number of  The Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research  upon 313 the phenomena of crystalvision and reviews these in the light of cognate experiments of her own The phenomenon though simple has a very ancient and varied history It consists in gazing into a a crystal a drop of water polished metal a gem or even the finger nail and seeing there reflected certain appearances usually to be interpreted as of prophetic significance The custom is very wide spread in the Orient both in the most ancient and in modern times It has been found among savages it has been counted as an in strument of the devil it has received noble treatment at the hands of the learned before the courts of princes Like most such cus toms it has been surrounded with mystic and religious proceedings and its exercise controlled by elaborate and fanciful directions The Assyrians the Hebrews the Greeks the Romans were ac quainted with the process and give evidences of its use In early Christian times those who read the future by gazing into a mirror received the title of  specularii They appear in a church council convened by St Patrick in 450 while we have a list of procedures against them as heretics in the twelfth century Although Thomas Aquinas attributes this power possessed by some children to the work of the devil and though a special condemnation of it was made by the theological faculty of Paris in 1398 the art continued and in the sixteenth century reached its zenith under the auspices of a court physician or a university professor Catherine de Medic consulted a magician who showed her in a mirror how long her sons would occupy the throne The topic was brought into promi nenceby the work of Dr Dee a very entertaining personage under whom the process was systematized and produced wonderful re sults Dr Dee and his associate one Kelly of dubious repute see spirit visitors in their crystal or shewstone who are described in all detail Moreover they hold long conversations with them though what they learn from the 1 angelicall beings  is often mere sermonlike stuffe The stone is  of that value that no earthly kingdom is of that worthinesse as to be compared to the vertue or dignity thereof  it is brought to him by angels  it is miraculously restored to him it is placed in a sanctuary and shown with great ceremony We read of many other uses of the crystal we have instructions whereby to have a spirit enclosed in a crystal stone or beryl glass and from these mediaeval notions we have almost a continuous use of the process down to modern times Considering the function of the crystal simply as a means of con centrating the gaze our author attempts to follow the course of these visions by analogy with other hallucinations and regards them as consisting mainly of i afterimages or recrudescent memories often rising thus and thus only from the subconscious strata to which they had sunk and 2 as objectivations of ideas or images consciously or unconsciously in the mind of the percipient The tendency of the conscious memory is so strongly in favor of picturemaking that we may naturally assume this habit on the part of that which is latent or subconscious This at ally rate is true for the lady in question for she is gifted with a remarkable power of visualization that goes far to explain her success at crystalvision When desirous of describing a room in a friends house she tells us  I return in recollection to the occasion of my last visit I once more occupy the same chair The carpet at my feet becomes visible the furniture nearest to my seat gradually the whole contents of the room till walls and ceil ing complete the picture and I am able to give an inventory which would not disgrace an auctioneers clerk The exercise of this faculty and especially with regard to phenomena of the uncon scious seems to be much aided by fixation of the attention upon the crystal To quote from the record of experiments  Here for example I find in the crystal a bit of dark wall covered with white jessamine and I ask myself  Where have I walked today  I have no recollection of such a sight not a common one in the London streets but tomorrow I will repeat my walk of this morn ing with a careful regard for creepercovered walls Tomorrow solves the mystery I find the very spot and the sight brings with it the further recollection that at the moment we passed this spot I was engaged in absorbing conversation with my companion and my voluntary attention was preoccupied Or again  I had care lessly destroyed a letter without preserving the address of my corre spondent I knew the county and searching in a map recognized the name of the town one unfamiliar to me but which I was sure NOVEMBER 8 I889  T T 314 blLtL I should know when I saw it But I had no clew to the name of house or street till at last it struck me to test the value of the crystal as a means of recalling forgotten knowledge A very short inspection supplied me with  H House in gray letters on a white ground and having nothing better to suggest from any other source I risked posting my letter to the address so strangely sup plied A day or two brought me an answer headed  H House  in gray letters on a white ground Again  the question of association as in all cases of memory plays an active part in this class of crystalvision One of my earliest experiences was of a picture perplexing and wholly unexpected  a quaint oak chair an old hand a worn black coatsleeve resting on the arm of the chair  slowly recognized as a recollection of a room in a country vicarage which I had not entered and but seldom recalled since I was a child of ten But whence came this vision  What associa tion has conjured up this picture What have I done today    At length the clew is found I have today been reading Dante first enjoyed with the help of our dear old vicar many a year ago After these instances and there are many more in some of which the crystal is purposely resorted to and often successfully to see if there be any unconscious information regarding the where abouts of a missing prescription or a lost key we may agree with the writer that  one result of crystalgazing is to teach one to abjure the verb to forget in all its moods and tenses Examples of the objectification of recent sensations are given but the point is clear enough without instances Although the author regards recent impressions as a less important element of her dream life and her visualizations than older experiences she can none the less create a group of figures and put them in the crystal to see what they will do  and so far is ones conscious a stranger to ones unconscious Ego that I sometimes find their little drama so startling and unexpected that I watch the scene with curiosity and surprise One more instance may be added The author wanted the date of Ptolemy Philadelphus felt sure that she knew it and connected it with some important event but could not recall it The crystal showed her an old man  dressed like a Lyceum Shylock and writing on a big book with massive clasps Wondering who he was she decided to carry out a suggestion and look at the image througha magnifyingglass Theglass revealed the characters as Greek though the only characters recognized were the numerals LXX Then it flashed on my mind that he was one of the Jewish elders at work on the Septuagint and that its date 277 BC would serve equally well for Ptolemy Philadel phus It may be worth while to add though the fact was not in my conscious memory at the moment that I had once learned a chronology on a mnemonic system which substituted letters for figures and that the memoria technica for this date was Now Jewish elders indite a Greek copy Our author adds a possible third class of crystalvisions con cerning which she speaks with becoming caution and uncertainty namely those that may be connected with telepathy clairvoyance and other doubtful faculties It is true that historically this use of crystalvision is the most important and if we could credit the evidence of wonderful facts revealed by this means we would in deed have to call in other means of explanation than those science affords But the methods of using this form of vision for purposes of more or less conscious deception are so various and lie so close at hand indeed our author cites some pertinent cases in which prophetic powers ascribed alleged to a crystalseer were shown to be groundless by the exercise of very ordinary precautions that we need hardly have recourse to untoward hypotheses as yet As is well remarkedi  it is easy to see how visions of this kind occur ring in the age of superstition almost irresistibly suggested the theory of spiritvisitation The percipient receiving information which he did not recognize as already in his own mind would in evitably suppose it to be derived from some invisible and unknown source external to himself A large class of prophecies too aid in their own fulfilment and in brief this aspect of the topic pre sents nothing peculiar to itself and may be dismissed with the mention of it already made We have illustrated in this study the subtilty of the relation be tween the conscious and the unconscious mental processes We see what a small proportion of the endless impressions that stream NCE VOL XIV No 353 in upon us through the avenues of sense are consciously added to our mental storehouse and what a very much larger portion must be at the service of those lower strata of consciousness that at times rise so unexpectedly and so mysteriously into the focus of attention And finally just as much of the mystery that sur rounded the mesmeric phenomena fell away when men looked for their explanation not in some peculiar gift of the mesmerist but in the psychophysic constitution of the subject so the phenomena connected with crystalvision become psychologically rational when we seek their explanation not in the magic properties of the crys tal but in the mind of the seer NOTES AND NEWS THE American Institute Fair in this city which will close in a few weeks is well worth a visit from any person interested in the progress made from year to year in

region are perhaps the best known Mr Henry 0 Avery in a letter to Building on the efflores cence on bricks says  During a recent trip abroad I noticed in several countries a common occurrence of exuding salts on the surface of brick constructions On questioning several foreign architects about the cause and remedy there seemed to be a variety of opinions and from the seeming contradictions I will note down some i Sulphate of magnesia due to the presence of iron pyrites sulphide of iron in the clay The action of sulphurous acid gen erated in the combustion of bituminous coal on the magnesia in the clay changes the pyrites to a sulphate of magnesia 2 Car bonate of soda probably caused by the lime of the mortar acting upon a silicate of soda in the brick 3 Carbonate of lime formed by the leaching of lime from mortar carbonated by the carbonic acid in the air 4 Silicate of soda caused by using salt clay taken near the sea There is a common theory that the trouble is mostly due to the action of mortar and the brick together yet the  Epsom salts have been known to appear in ornamental parapet walls where there was no mortar cement or grouting of any kind Some say that bricks burned with woodfire were exempt from the nui sance but historical architectural records of Boston speak of  white saline coatings one hundred years ago when wood only was used for burning bricks As to remedies several are mentioned The commonest is water and muriatic acid  but this does not always decompose the sulphate of soda and will not prevent it exuding again Oil in mortar carefully laid is supposed to prevent  salt petring one gallon to a cask of lime or two if cement is used but this has failed as often as it has succeeded English architects quite frequently employ a solution of fatty matter quicklime and cementpowder and the French and Swiss masons a mortar 11

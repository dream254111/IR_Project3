DISTINGUISHED ENUE MUST FIRST BE CAREFULLY AND ACCURATELY DISTINGUISHED FROM JURISDICTION JURISDICTION SAID JUSTICE BROWN1 IS THE POWER TO ADJUDICATE A CASE UPON THE MERITS AND DISPOSE OF IT AS JUSTICE MAY REQUIRE VENUE HAS REFERENCE MERELY TO THE PLACE OF THE SUIT JURISDICTION IS A QUESTION OF THE POWER OF A COURT VENUE OF LOCALITY JURISDICTION CONTROLS THE JUDICIAL CA PACITY TO HEAR THE CASE VENUE ANSWERS THE ONLY QUESTION OF WHERE THE CASE SHOULD BE HEARD2 THE JURISDICTION OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT CONCERNS THE VARIOUS CLASSES OF CASES THAT THIS COURT CAN DECIDE AND DEFINES AND LIMITS THE POWERS OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT AS A PART OF THE JUDICIAL MACHINERY OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT IS ONLY AFTER THE QUESTION OF THE JURISDICTION OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT IS ANSWERED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE THAT THE QUESTION OF VENUE EVER ARISES THEN THE GEOGRAPHICAL ISSUE MUST BE DETERMINED OF WHERE THE SUIT IS TO BE BROUGHTTHE VENUE IT IS OBVIOUS THAT IF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT CAN NOT ENTERTAIN JURISDICTION OF A CASE THIS EF THE RESOLUTE 168 U S 437 18 SUP CT 112 42 L ED 533 2 WHILE ONLY THE U S DISTRICT COURT IS THE SUBJECT OF INQUIRY IN THIS ARTICLE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN JURISDICTION AND VENUE IS IM PORTANT ALSO IN STATE COURTS THUS THE VIRGINIA STATUTES CONTROL THE JURISDICTION OF THE VIRGINIA CIRCUIT COURTS AND THEN SPECIFY IN WHICH COUNTY THE SUIT IS TO BE BROUGHT IF THE JURISDICTION OF THE CIRCUIT COURT BE HERE CONCEDED WHETHER THE CASE MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF NELSON COUNTY OR IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF ALBEMARLE COUNTY IS PURELY A QUESTION OF VENUEVIRGINIA LAW REVIEW FECTIVELY STIFLES ANY QUESTION AS TO VENUE SOME WRITERS USE THE TERM JURISDICTION OVER THE SUBJECT MATTER INSTEAD OF JU RISDICTION WHILE JURISDICTION OVER THE PERSON IS EMPLOYED AS THE EQUIVALENT OF VENUE THE TERMINOLOGY IS OPEN TO MANY OB VIOUS OBJECTIONS PARTICULARLY IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THE JURIS DICTION OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DEPENDS IN SOME CASES SOLELY ON THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE LITIGATION WHILE IN OTHERS IT IS ENTIRELY CONTROLLED BY THE CITIZENSHIP OF THE LITI GANTS THE MOST IMPORTANT LEGAL DIFFERENCE ARISING FROM THE DISTINC TION BETWEEN JURISDICTION AND VENUE IS THAT NO CASE CAN BE TRIED IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT UNLESS THIS CASE FALLS WITHIN THE CONGRESSIONAL GRANT OF JUDICIAL POWER TO THAT COURT WHICH GRANT MUST IN TURN BE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE JUDICIAL POWER OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS OUTLINED BY ARTICLE 3  2 PAR 1 OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION UNLESS THIS REQUIREMENT IS STRICTLY FULFILLED EVEN WITH THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES OR EVEN AT THEIR INSISTENT REQUEST THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT IS POWER LESS TO HEAR THE CASE3 WHEN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT HAS NO JURISDICTION THEREFORE UNDER THE FEDERAL STATUTES THIS CAN NOT BE CURED BY ANY WAIVER BY THE PARTIES TO THE CONTROVERSY VENUE ON THE OTHER HAND IS MERELY A PERSONAL PRIVILEGE WHICH IF WAIVED BY THE PARTIES CAN NOT BE QUESTIONED BY THE JUDGE AND THIS IS TRUE EVEN THOUGH THE VENUE IS MANIFESTLY IMPROPER4 IF THE QUESTION OF VENUE IS PROPERLY RAISED HOWEVER AND THE VENUE IS HELD IMPROPER THEN THIS DISPOSES SOLELY OF THE QUESTION OF LOCALITY AND LEAVES THE DISAPPOINTED LITIGANT FREE TO BRING THE SUIT IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT IN ANOTHER LOCALITY DIS TRICT AND IF HE DOES THIS THE QUESTION OF VENUE AS TO THE LATTER LOCALITY DISTRICT MAY BE AGAIN RAISED AND DECIDED THE QUES TION OF JURISDICTION OR THE POWER OF THE COURT IS ALWAYS BEFORE THE COURT IT MAY BE RAISED BY THE COURT WITHOUT AN OBJECTION OR EVEN A SUGGESTION FROM EITHER LITIGANT OR COUNSEL THE POWER TO DISMISS A SUIT AT ANY TIME AFTER SUCH SUIT HAS BEEN BROUGHT WHEN IT SHALL APPEAR TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE SAID DISTRICT COURT THAT THE SUIT IS NOT PROPERLY WITHIN ITS JURISDICTION IS EX 3 HEIGLER V FAULKNER 127 U S 482 8 SUP CT 1203 32 L ED 310 4 IN RE MOORE 209 U S 490 28 SUP CT 585

LOCALITY DISTRICT AS DIS TINGUISHED FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT OF ANOTHER LOCALITY DISTRICT6 DISTRICT THE GEOGRAPHICAL UNIT SECTIONS 69115 OF THE JUDICIAL CODE DIVIDE THE UNITED STATES INTO GEOGRAPHICAL UNITS KNOWN AS DISTRICTS AND  1 OF THIS CODE PROVIDES THAT IN EACH OF THE DISTRICTS THERE SHALL BE A UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT THIS DIVISION OF THE COUNTRY INTO DISTRICTS IS PURELY

OTHER DIVISION OF THE SAME DISTRICT 8 SEE MORRIS V GILMER 129 U S 315 9 SUP CT 289 32 L ED 690 O EX PARTE WISNER 203 U S 449 27 SUP CT 150 51 L ED 264 3VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW VENUE IN CRIMINAL CASES SO STRIKING IS THE IMPORTANCE OF VENUE IN CRIMINAL CASES THAT THE MOST FARREACHING PROVISIONS ON THIS SUBJECT ARE FOUND IN THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION THE SIXTH AMENDMENT PROVIDES THAT THE TRIAL SHALL BE IN THE STATE AND DISTRICT IN WHICH THE CRIME IS COMMITTED WHEN THE CRIME IS NOT COMMITTED WITHIN ANY STATE THEN ART 3  2 PAR 3 OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTI TUTION GIVES CONGRESS POWER TO CONTROL THE VENUE IN PUR SUANCE OF THIS POWER CONGRESS HAS ENACTED THE TRIAL OF ALL OFFENSES COMMITTED UPON THE HIGH SEAS OR ELSEWHERE OUT OF THE JURISDICTION OF ANY PARTICULAR STATE OR DISTRICT SHALL BE IN THE DISTRICT WHERE THE OFFENDER IS FOUND OR INTO WHICH HE IS FIRST BROUGHT JUDICIAL CODE  41 7 THUS FOR A MURDER COM MITTED UPON THE HIGH SEAS ON A MERCHANT VESSEL FLYING THE UNITED STATES FLAG WHEN THE VESSEL FIRST PUTS INTO NORFOLK THE TRIAL WOULD PROPERLY BE HELD IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA SITTING AT NORFOLK THE RIGHTS GUARANTEED BY THE SIXTH AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION HAVE BEEN STILL FURTHER SAFEGUARDED BY  40 OF THE JUDICIAL CODE PRO VIDING THAT IN CAPITAL CASES THE TRIAL SHALL BE HAD NOT ONLY IN THE STATE AND DISTRICT BUT ALSO IN THE COUNTY IN WHICH THE OFFENSE WAS COMMITTED WHERE THAT CAN BE DONE WITHOUT GREAT INCON VENIENCE SECTION 53 OF THE JUDICIAL CODE FURTHER PROVIDES ALL PROSECUTIONS FOR CRIMES AND OFFENSES SHALL BE HAD WITHIN THE DI VISION OF SUCH DISTRICT WHERE THE SAME WERE COMMITTED UNLESS THE COURT    SHALL ORDER THE CAUSE TO BE TRANSFERRED    TO ANOTHER DIVISION OF THE DISTRICT THE STUDENT OF CRIMINAL LAW IS FAMILIAR WITH THE DIFFICULTY OF DETERMINING IN SOME CASES THE LOCALITY OF THE OFFENSE8 PARTICULARLY IS THIS TRUE WHEN AN ACT IS DONE IN ONE DISTRICT WHICH TAKES CRIMINAL EFFECT IN ANOTHER A DISCUSSION OF THESE PROBLEMS HOWEVER BELONGS T AN INTERESTING CASE ON THE FACTS IN THIS CONNECTION THOUGH THE OPINION CONTAINS NO DISCUSSION OF THE QUESTION INVOLVED IS U S V ARWO 19 WALL 486 22 L ED 67 8 FOR AN

WHEN A FEDERAL OFFENSE IS BEGUN IN ONE DISTRICT AND COMPLETED IN ANOTHER THE TRIAL MAY BE HAD AND THE OFFENDER PUNISHED IN EITHER DISTRICT AS IF THE CRIME HAD BEEN WHOLLY COM MITTED IN SUCH DISTRICT VENUE IN CIVIL CASES INSTITUTED IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT THE PROVISION OF WIDEST APPLICATION ON THIS SUBJECT IS FOUND IN  51 OF THE JUDICIAL CODE THIS SECTION DISTINGUISHES CLEARLY BETWEEN 1 CASES IN WHICH JURISDICTION IS BASED ON THE FACT THAT THE ACTION IS BETWEEN CITIZENS OF DIFFERENT STATES THE SO CALLED DIVERSE CITIZENSHIP CASES THOUGH THIS EXPRESSION IS NOT CONTAINED IN THE FEDERAL STATUTES AND 2 CASES IN WHICH THE JURISDICTION OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT IS NOT BASED ON DIVERSE CITIZENSHIP THE SECTION THEN PROVIDES THAT SUBJECT TO THE EXCEPTIONS CONTAINED IN THE SIX SUCCEEDING SECTIONS  52 57 OF THE JUDICIAL CODE IN CASES NOT BASED ON DIVERSE CITIZEN SHIP THE PROPER VENUE IS THE DISTRICT OF THE DEFENDANT WHILE IN DIVERSE CITIZENSHIP CASES THE SUIT MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE DIS TRICT OF THE RESIDENCE OF EITHER THE PLAINTIFF OR THE DEFENDANT IT IS THUS CLEAR THAT IN CASES NOT DEPENDING ON DIVERSE CITIZENSHIP TO CONFER JURISDICTION THERE IS ONLY ONE PROPER VENUETHE RESI DENCE OF THE DEFENDANT WHILE IN DIVERSE CITIZENSHIP CASES THE PLAINTIFF HAS AN ELECTION OF TWO DISTRICTS EITHER OF WHICH IS PROPER THE DISTRICT OF THE PLAINTIFF OR THE DISTRICT OF THE DEFENDANT AN IMPORTANT QUALIFICATION OF THE RULE JUST STATED WHICH GREATLY RESTRICTS THE VENUE IS THIS THE TERMS PLAINTIFF AND DE FENDANT ARE USED COLLECTIVELY AND MEAN ALL THE PLAINTIFFS OR ALL THE DEFENDANTS9 WITH BUT A SINGLE PLAINTIFF AND A SINGLE DEFENDANT THIS PRINCIPLE IS NEVER CALLED INTO OPERATION BUT WITH A PLURALITY OF LITIGANTS IT BECOMES TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT THUS WHEN JURISDICTION

IS THE DISTRICT OF ALL THE DEFENDANTS AND IN NEITHER DISTRICT IS THE VENUE PROPER OF COURSE IF THE DEFENDANTS HOWEVER NUMEROUS ARE ALL FROM THE SAME DISTRICT SUIT CAN BE BROUGHT IN THAT DISTRICT IN DIVERSE CITIZENSHIP CASES THOUGH THE DISTRICT MAY BE THAT OF EITHER PLAINTIFF OR DEFENDANT THE SAME PRINCIPLES ARE APPLICABLE SO THAT IF A OF THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA WISHES TO BRING SUIT IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT BASED ON DIVERSE CITIZENSHIP AGAINST B OF THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA AND C OF THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA THEN SINCE THERE IS NO DISTRICT COMMON TO ALL THE DEFENDANTS THE VENUE MUST BE BASED ON THE DISTRICT OF THE SINGLE PLAINTIFF AND ONLY THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA WOULD BE PROPER OR SUPPOSE AGAIN IN A DIVERSE CITIZENSHIP CASE A OF THE

DISTINGUISHED ENUE must first be carefully and accurately distinguished from jurisdiction Jurisdiction said Justice Brown1 is the power to adjudicate a case upon the merits and dispose of it as justice may require Venue has reference merely to the place of the suit Jurisdiction is a question of the power of a court venue of locality Jurisdiction controls the judicial ca pacity to hear the case venue answers the only question of where the case should be heard2 The jurisdiction of the United States District Court concerns the various classes of cases that this court can decide and defines and limits the powers of the United States District Court as a part of the judicial machinery of the Federal government It is only after the question of the jurisdiction of the United States District Court is answered in the affirmative that the question of venue ever arises Then the geographical issue must be determined of where the suit is to be broughtthe venue It is obvious that if the United States District Court can not entertain jurisdiction of a case this ef The Resolute 168 U S 437 18 Sup Ct 112 42 L Ed 533 2 While only the U S District Court is the subject of inquiry in this article the distinction between jurisdiction and venue is im portant also in State Courts Thus the Virginia Statutes control the jurisdiction of the Virginia Circuit Courts and then specify in which county the suit is to be brought If the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court be here conceded whether the case must be brought in the Circuit Court of Nelson County or in the Circuit Court of Albemarle County is purely a question of venueVIRGINIA LAW REVIEW fectively stifles any question as to venue Some writers use the term jurisdiction over the subject matter instead of ju risdiction while jurisdiction over the person is employed as the equivalent of venue The terminology is open to many ob vious objections particularly in view of the fact that the juris diction of the United States District Court depends in some cases solely on the subject matter of the litigation while in others it is entirely controlled by the citizenship of the liti gants The most important legal difference arising from the distinc tion between jurisdiction and venue is that no case can be tried in the United States District Court unless this case falls within the Congressional grant of judicial power to that court which grant must in turn be within the limits of the judicial power of the Federal Government as outlined by Article 3  2 par 1 of the United States Constitution Unless this requirement is strictly fulfilled even with the consent of the parties or even at their insistent request the United States District Court is power less to hear the case3 When the United States District Court has no jurisdiction therefore under the Federal statutes this can not be cured by any waiver by the parties to the controversy Venue on the other hand is merely a personal privilege which if waived by the parties can not be questioned by the judge and this is true even though the venue is manifestly improper4 If the question of venue is properly raised however and the venue is held improper then this disposes solely of the question of locality and leaves the disappointed litigant free to bring the suit in the United States District Court in another locality dis trict and if he does this the question of venue as to the latter locality district may be again raised and decided The ques tion of jurisdiction or the power of the court is always before the court it may be raised by the court without an objection or even a suggestion from either litigant or counsel The power to dismiss a suit at any time after such suit has been brought when it shall appear to the satisfaction of the said district court that the suit is not properly within its jurisdiction is ex 3 Heigler v Faulkner 127 U S 482 8 Sup Ct 1203 32 L Ed 310 4 In re Moore 209 U S 490 28 Sup Ct 585 52 L Ed 904 2VEAUE IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT pressly given by  37 of the Federal Judicial Code5 When the court has jurisdiction of the case however the question of venue must be specifically raised and presented to the court by a litigant who has not previously waived this right The court is then called upon to decide whether the case is triable in the United States District Court of that locality district as dis tinguished from the United States District Court of another locality district6 DISTRICT THE GEOGRAPHICAL UNIT Sections 69115 of the Judicial Code divide the United States into geographical units known as districts and  1 of this Code provides that in each of the districts there shall be a United States District Court This division of the country into districts is purely arbitrary No district however cuts across the lines of two States so as to include a part of one State and a part of another Some of the smaller States Delaware and Rhode Is land for example constitute each a single district Texas though is divided into four districts Tennessee into three Vir ginia into two These districts are designated according to the geographical position occupied by them in the State Thus the eastern half of Virginia is known as the Eastern District of Virginia while the western half of the State makes up the West ern District of Virginal The United States District Court sitting in the former district is known as the United States Dis trict Court for the Eastern District of Virginia sitting in the latter it is the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia In some of the States for purposes of con venience a single district is further divided into two or more divisions Thus the eastern district of Tennessee is divided into the Southern Northern and Northeastern Divisions of said district By  58 of the Judicial Code any civil case on stipulation of the parties may by order of the judge be trans ferred to the court of any other division of the same district 8 See Morris v Gilmer 129 U S 315 9 Sup Ct 289 32 L Ed 690 o Ex parte Wisner 203 U S 449 27 Sup Ct 150 51 L Ed 264 3VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW VENUE IN CRIMINAL CASES So striking is the importance of venue in criminal cases that the most farreaching provisions on this subject are found in the Federal Constitution The Sixth Amendment provides that the trial shall be in the State and district in which the crime is committed When the crime is not committed within any state then Art 3  2 par 3 of the United States Consti tution gives Congress power to control the venue In pur suance of this power Congress has enacted The trial of all offenses committed upon the high seas or elsewhere out of the jurisdiction of any particular State or district shall be in the district where the offender is found or into which he is first brought Judicial Code  41 7 Thus for a murder com mitted upon the high seas on a merchant vessel flying the United States flag when the vessel first puts into Norfolk the trial would properly be held in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia sitting at Norfolk The rights guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution have been still further safeguarded by  40 of the Judicial Code pro viding that in capital cases the trial shall be had not only in the State and district but also in the county in which the offense was committed where that can be done without great incon venience Section 53 of the Judicial Code further provides all prosecutions for crimes and offenses shall be had within the di vision of such district where the same were committed unless the court    shall order the cause to be transferred    to another division of the district The student of criminal law is familiar with the difficulty of determining in some cases the locality of the offense8 Particularly is this true when an act is done in one district which takes criminal effect in another A discussion of these problems however belongs T An interesting case on the facts in this connection though the opinion contains no discussion of the question involved is U S v Arwo 19 Wall 486 22 L Ed 67 8 For an admirable discussion of this subject see Clark and Mar shall on Crimes  493511 Interesting Federal cases are Barton v U S 196 U S 283 25 Sup Ct 243 49 L Ed 482 Palliser v U S 136 U S 257 10 Sup Ct 1034 34 L Ed 514 4VENUE IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT more properly to works on criminal law Some of these problems have been simplified though by  42 of the Judicial Code This provides that when a Federal offense is begun in one district and completed in another the trial may be had and the offender punished in either district as if the crime had been wholly com mitted in such district VENUE IN CIVIL CASES INSTITUTED IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT The provision of widest application on this subject is found in  51 of the Judicial Code This section distinguishes clearly between 1 cases in which jurisdiction is based on the fact that the action is between citizens of different states the so called diverse citizenship cases though this expression is not contained in the Federal Statutes and 2 cases in which the jurisdiction of the United States District Court is not based on diverse citizenship The section then provides that subject to the exceptions contained in the six succeeding sections  52 57 of the Judicial Code in cases not based on diverse citizen ship the proper venue is the district of the defendant while in diverse citizenship cases the suit may be brought in the dis trict of the residence of either the plaintiff or the defendant It is thus clear that in cases not depending on diverse citizenship to confer jurisdiction there is only one proper venuethe resi dence of the defendant while in diverse citizenship cases the plaintiff has an election of two districts either of which is proper the district of the plaintiff or the district of the defendant An important qualification of the rule just stated which greatly restricts the venue is this The terms plaintiff and de fendant are used collectively and mean all the plaintiffs or all the defendants9 With but a single plaintiff and a single defendant this principle is never called into operation but with a plurality of litigants it becomes tremendously important Thus when jurisdiction is not based on diverse citizenship so that the venue must be based on the residence of the defendants if there are 9 Smith v Lyon 133 U S 315 10 Sup Ct 303 33 L Ed 635 Mc Auley v Moody 185 Fed 144 5VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW two or more defendants from different districts then there is no district of the defendant since there is no district of all the defendants and hence no district in which the venue is proper So that when a suit not based on diverse citizenship is brought against A of the Eastern District of Virginia and B of the Western District of North Carolina neither of these districts is the district of all the defendants and in neither district is the venue proper Of course if the defendants however numerous are all from the same district suit can be brought in that district In diverse citizenship cases though the district may be that of either plaintiff or defendant the same principles are applicable So that if A of the Northern District of Florida wishes to bring suit in the United States District Court based on diverse citizenship against B of the Western District of Virginia and C of the Eastern District of North Carolina then since there is no district common to all the defendants the venue must be based on the district of the single plaintiff and only the Northern District of Florida would be proper Or suppose again in a diverse citizenship case A of the Northern District of Florida and B of the Southern District of Georgia wish to sue C of the Western District of Virginia and D of the Eastern District of North Carolina Here there is no district in which the venue is proper for there is no district common ei ther to all the plaintiffs or to all the defendants If however in any of these cases any party is not indispensable the suit may be dismissed as to such party and the venue will then be worked out on the basis of the remaining indispensable par ties10 In determining the residence of corporations the cor poration is a citizen only of the State in which it is incorporated and not of the other States in which it does businessll When 10 Schiffer v Anderson 146 Fed 457 76 C C A 667 Ladew v Tenn Copper Co 179 Fed 245 See also

Texas the defendant was incorpo 6VENUE IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT the State of the corporation is divided into more than one district the district of the corporation is normally that in which the cor poration has its head office Thus in a suit by A of Pennsyl vania and B of New York against the X corporation in corporated under laws of West Virginia head office in the Northern District of West Virginia the district in which the venue is proper is the Northern District of West Virginia wheresoever else the corporation may be doing business12 Since an alien is not a citizen of any district the above prin ciples do not apply in suits against aliens whether these be na tural persons or corporations In such cases if the proper juris dictional facts exist suit may be brought against the alien in any district in which process can be validly served on the alien de fendant13 When however the alien is plaintiff then the proper district is that of the defendant citizen of the United States whether this defendant be a corporation or natural per son14 Another complication rendering the practical problem of suit able venue still more difficult is the service of process Ordi narily federal process does not run out of the district in which it is issued An in personam judgment can be obtained against a defendant accordingly only by serving such defendant in the district in which the suit is brought The service of process on a natural person in any district in which he can be found pre rated under the Laws of Kentucky but was doing business in the Western District of Texas Held the Western District of Texas being the district of neither plaintiff nor defendant was not the proper venue Suppose a suit based on diverse citizenship brought by M of Port land Maine and the W Company incorporated under the laws of Vermont principal office at Burlington against P of Boston Mass The W Company does a large business at Portland Here though M lives at Portland this is not the district of the W Co though it does business there Accordingly the district of the defendant P is the only proper venue 12 Sweeny v Carter Oil Co 199 U S 252 26 Sup Ct 55 13 Barrow S S Co v Kane

357 31 Sup Ct 81 54 L Ed 1069 7VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW sents usually no legal difficulty Service of process however on corporations presents this striking limitation A corporation can validly be served only in a district in which it is doing business 15 Unless the corporation is doing business in a particular district valid service of process in that district is im possible Thus the Y corporation incorporated in Maryland which is not doing business in the Western District of Virginia can not be served in this district though all the officers of the corporation may be present in Charlottesville So that in a suit by A of Charlottesville against the Y corporation based on diverse citizenship while the Western District of Virginia is technically the proper venue the plaintiff wishing to sue in the United States District Court since the defendant could never be served in that district would be driven to the defendants dis trict in Maryland Accordingly while a Virginia corporation does not become a citizen or inhabitant of the district of Maryland by doing business in Baltimore in so far as the propriety of the venue is concerned yet in a suit against the corporation in Maryland if that be the proper venue the corporation is amenable to process in the district of Maryland Though nu merous cases involve that question it is beyond the scope of this article to discuss what constitutes doing business in a district on the part of a corporation which will render it liable to serv ice of process in that district The term however involves some continuity a series of transactions in the line of the cor porations business rather than one or even more single and somewhat isolated and unrelated acts16 In this connection should be emphasized as has already been 16 Conley v Alkali Works 190 U S 406 23 Sup Ct 728 47 L Ed 1113 Green v Chicago etc Ry Co 205 U S 530 Suppose a suit by H of Virginia against Q of Baltimore Md and the Z corpora tion incorporated in Massachusetts principal office in Boston not doing business in Virginia Here the defendants being from different districts the venue must be the district of the single plaintiff But in this district though the venue is proper no service can be had on the Z corpora tion Hence there is for practical purposes no suitable venue and unless this defect is waived the plaintiff is denied entrance into the United States District Court 6 See Green v Chicago etc Ry Co 205 U S 530 Peterson v Ry Co 205 U S 364 Fitzgerald Co v Fitzgerald 137 U S 98 8VENUE IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT stated that venue as distinguished from jurisdiction may be waived When it is waived however improper the venue may be the court can not question its propriety and the parties waiv ing it thereby conclusively estop themselves from raising the question17 Such a waiver may be either express or implied usually the latter Objection to the venue which virtually ad mits the jurisdiction of the United States District Court though it denies the propriety of the suit being brought in the United States District Court of that particular district is in the nature of a plea in abatement An appearance for that purpose is accordingly a special appearance of a highly technical character It therefore follows that such an appearance for such an objec tion is proper only in the earliest stages of the suit A defend ant then who makes a general appearance can not afterwards question the venue18 Nor can a general and special appear ance be combined so that the defendant can not unite a plea to the merits or even a general demurrer with an objection to the venue19 The plaintiff of course waives his right to ob ject to the venue by bringing the suit in the district in ques tion It would be absurd to permit a plaintiff to file a suit in the United States District Court in a specific district and then to question the propriety of the court whose aid he had invoked in the very district of his own selection VENUE IN CASES REMOVED TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT As is well known the United States District Court acquires jurisdiction not only when cases are originally filed therein but also in certain instances when cases orginally filed in a State Court are removed by the defendant from such court to the United States District Court20 The defendant thus becomes 17 In re Moore 209 U S 490 28 Sup Ct 585 52 L Ed

defendant can exercise in a proper case and the State Court must recognize it even against the protestation of the plaintiff21 The conditions giving rise to this right as well as the circumstances involved in its exercise are not within the scope of this article In general the same considerations appli cable to the venue in cases within the original jurisdiction of the United States District Court apply equally to cases of which this court acquires jurisdiction by removal from a State Court There are some unique considerations however as to removal venue that seem to call for separate and special discussion The two most important classes of cases falling within the removal jurisdiction of the United States District Court are cases involv ing federal questions and cases based on diverse citizenship Cases involving a federal question arising under the Con stitution or laws of the United States ordinarily involve no great difficulty The only proper venue in such cases is the district of the defendant The plaintiffs district this being a case in which the jurisdiction is not based on diverse citizenship is immaterial Nor does the removing defendant as is true of diverse citizenship cases have to be a nonresident of the district in which the State Court in which the suit is filed is sit uated22 Only to the United States District Court of the dis trict in which this State Court sits can the defendant remove the casethe United States District Court in all other districts is closed to him23 The defendant by the removal estops him self from questioning the venue24 But the plaintiff by filing suit in the State Court does not estop himself from questioning the federal venue he has consented to the venue of the State Court chosen by himself but not to the venue of the federal court selected by the defendant25 Simply stated then the sit uation is this The plaintiff can question the venue usually by 21 Judicial Code  29 22 Judicial Code  28 Judicial Code  29 24 In re

cases but the principles of estoppel are the same as in cases involving federal questions 10VENUE IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 11 a motion to remand the case to the State Court filed in the United States District Court This court then has to decide whether the district is the district of the defendantthe only proper venue If this question is decided in the affirmative the United States District Court retains the case and proceeds to adjudicate it Should the question be decided in the negative the United States District Court enters an order from which no appeal can be taken 26 remanding the case to the State Court from which it has been removed which court then pro ceeds with the case In diverse citizenship cases the question of removal venue is much more complicated This is due chiefly to two causes 1 Here the proper venue may be either the district of the plaintiff or the district of the defendant using these terms col lectively as before 27 2 only the nonresident defendant can remove28the defendant has no such right if the district which includes the physical territory for which the State Court sits is the defendants district It should be noted that  28 of the Judicial Code provides that the case should be removed to the District Court of the United States for the proper dis trict The proper district must be as we have just seen the district of either the plaintiff or defendant In  29 of this Code it is provided that the removal must be into the United States District Court to be held in the district where such suit is pending in the State Court This last provision is man datory and cannot be waived29 The only district into which the suit can be removed is the district that includes the physical territory for which the State Court sits Thus Albemarle County Virginia is included within the Western District of Virginia Accordingly suits filed in the Circuit Court of Albe marle County removable from this State Court to the United States District Court must be removed to the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia If this district be divided into divisions the Judicial Code  53 pro vides for a removal into

situated from which the re moval is made Now after  29 has been fulfilled by a re moval to the only district which its peremptory provision per mits then the question arises whether as  28 requires this district is the proper district according to the principles previ ously discussed The requirement of  29 however being mandatory is not waivable and if the requirement is not ful filled the Federal Court takes no cognizance of the case But if  29 is carried out then the propriety of the venue is as in other cases a personal privilege which the parties may freely waive30 When the territorial provision of  29 and the pro priety provision of  29 are both satisfied the venue cannot suc cessfully be attacked The question remains as to the situation when  29 is satisfied but not  28 In such cases the removing nonresident defendant by the very act of removal waives his right to question the venue31 This leaves then the plaintiff alone as a possible objector on this score Does the plaintiff by filing suit in the State Court sit ting for territory included within the federal district consent on the removal of the case by the defendant to the venue of the United States District Court for that district when this district is not proper because it is neither the district of the plaintiff nor the district of the defendant Though some cases answered the question in the affirmative32 it was effectively and nega tively answered by the United States Supreme Court in Ex parte Wisner 203 U S 449 27 Sup Ct 150 51 L Ed 26433 In that case W of Michigan sued B of Louisiana

to remand the case to the State Court On the lower courts refusing to grant the motion the United States Supreme Court held a man damus was proper to compel the remanding of the case34 In re Moore 209 U S 490 28 Sup Ct 585 52 L Ed 904 14 Ann Cas 1164 affirmed the holding of the Wisner case that the plaintiff did not waive his right to question an improper venue on the removal of the case to the Federal Court merely by filing suit in the State Court But in the Moore case the plaintiff went much further and filed in the Federal Court an amended petition and various stipulations entered into by counsel on both sides Later the plaintiff filed a motion to remand in the Fed eral Court on the same ground as in the Wisner casethe dis trict was neither that of the plaintiff nor that of the defendant The United States Supreme Court held that by filing the amended petition and the stipulations in the Federal Court after the removal the plaintiff acknowledged the right of the Fed eral Court in that district to try the case and thereby waived effectually his right to question the venue35 These two cases the Wisner case and the Moore case are probably the lead ing cases on removal venue and in practically all the cases sub sequent to them they are cited and discussed36 A remarkable conflict of views has sprung up as to removal venue in suits brought by an alien in a State Court against a citizen of one of the States of the United States such defendant being either a natural person or a corporation It is perfectly clear in such cases that if the State Court sits in the defendants 3 See Ex parte Harding 219 U S 363 31 Sup Ct 324 55 L Ed 352 37 L R A N S 392 qualifying and disapproving the Wisner case as to the use of mandamus in this connection  The Moore case

REVIEW district the defendant cannot remove the case to the United States District Court because he is not a nonresident defend ant since the jurisdiction of this court is based on diverse citi zenship The State Court cannot sit in the district of the plain tiff for the alien has no district But suppose the State Court sits in a district other than the district of the defendant and the case is removed by the defendant to the United States District Court This district is manifestly the district of neither the plaintiff who has no district nor the defendant Can the alien plaintiff successfully move on the ground of the impropriety of the venue to remand the case to the State Court Sagara v Rail way Co 189 Fed 220 holds that he can37 Decker v Railway Co 189 Fed 224 the very next case in volume 189 of the Federal Reporter holds that he cannot38 If the Sagara case be upheld its effect in such cases would be to prevent absolutely the defendant ever from removing a case from a State Court to the United States District Court without the consent of the alien plaintiff It is believed that the decision of the Decker case which contains in small compass an unusual incisive dis cussion of removal venue announces the better rule This opinion is quoted and approved in Smellie v Railway Co 197 Fed 641 The question is quite important in States in which corporations chartered in a different State employ large num bers of aliens in occupations that give rise to frequent suits for personal injuries VENUE IN EXCEPTIONAL CASES In a number of instances special provision is made in the Federal Statutes as to venue in special cases covered by these statutes Thus the district is the Federal geographical unit and two districts in the same state are usually for purposes of venue as foreign to one another as two districts in two separate states Section 52 of the Judicial Code however provides that when there are two or more defendants residing in different 37 See also Mahopoulos v Chicago etc Ry Co 167 Fed 165 Odh ner v Nor Pac Ry Co 188 Fed 507 38 See also Barlow v Chicago etc Ry Co 164 Fed 765 Bagenas v So Pac Co 180 Fed 887 14VENUE IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 15 districts of the same state suit may be brought in either dis trict The succeeding section  53 provides when a district is divided into divisions that in suits not of a local nature against a single defendant these must be brought in the division of such defendant but if there are two or more defendants re siding in different divisions of the same district suit may be brought in either division Sections 54 and 55 provide as to different districts in the same state in suits of a local nature usually suits concerning real estate Section 56 confers on re ceivers in certain cases powers over property in any district of the circuit in which the district of the receivers appointment is situated Of unusual importance is  57 of the Judicial Code the last of the exceptional six succeeling sections provided for in  51 which is concerned with the enforcement of in rem claims affecting only the res or property and affixing no personal lia bility upon the defendant39 While the proper jurisdictional facts must exist to give the United States District Court juris diction diverse citizenship cases are most frequent the venue here is determined entirely by the location of the res or prop erty suit being brought in the district in which the property is situated without regard to the residence of either plaintiff or defendant neither of whom need be a resident of the district40 The operation of this section has been strictly limited to the enforcement of preexisting claims to definite property and at tempts to create claims or to enforce personal obligations under this section have met with prompt rebukes from the courts How strictly the courts adhere to this is admirably shown by the cases of Goodman v Niblack 102 U S 556 26 L Ed 229 and Fayerweather v Rich 89 Fed 385 In the Goodman case a bill in equity was filed to enforce a claim or lien upon a spe cific fund the court holding this to be a true in rem proceeding 39 Any suit commenced in any District Court of the United States to enforce any legal or equitable claim to or to remove any incumbrance or lien or cloud upon the title to real or personal property within the district where such suit is brought 40 Greeley v Lowe 155 U S 58 15 Sup Ct 54 39 L Ed 69 Ladew v Tenn Copper Co 179 Fed 245VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW coming within the statute in question The Fayerweather case was a suit by heirs against trustees to recover a residue in the hands of the trustees but no specific real or personal property was sought to be affected Therefore the suit was held not within the statute Suits to abate nuisances 41 and suits to com pel specific performance of contracts to convey property42 are likewise personal actions not within the purview of the statute Partition suits43 however suits to remove clouds upon titles 44 and suits to foreclose mortgages 45 are proceedings to enforce definite preexisting claims to specific property and thus come clearly within the statute Elaborate provisions as to proce dure are found in this section but these lie beyond the scope of this article The admiralty jurisdiction of the Federal Courts is unique in some cases exclusive while procedure in such cases differs widely from that in ordinary civil suits It is well settled that the general provisions of the Federal Statutes as to venue in the United States District Court particularly  51 of the Judi cial Code do not

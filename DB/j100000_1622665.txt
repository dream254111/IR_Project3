Cretaceous Gryphaeas of the Texas Region  was presented by Mr Vaughn He spoke of the abundance of the individuals of this genus and their value in determining the location of artesian wells the various species being characteristic of certain strata He traced the phylogeny of the species and dwelt at some length on their involved synonymy Chas F Dawson spoke of the  Dissemination of Infectious Diseases by Insects instancing the manner in which tuberculosis swine plague Texas fever and anthrax could be thus spread The speaker described his own experience with flies stating that from their habits they were particularly liable to convey disease Under the title The Type  of a NewOld Species William Palmer spoke of the confusion which existed in regard to certain genus of birds stating that while Linnaeus had originally given a specific name to what he believed to be a cosmopolitan species he had subsequently admitted a second species based on a plate while another author had described a third from still another plate There was no type existing of any of these while the authors of the second and third species had no specimens when they established their names Mr Palmer stated that two distinct birds had been confused underthe three names and that he proposed to separate them basing his description on a bird which he had selected among numerous specimens Would this specimen to which a binomial name and definite description were attached for the first time be a type  Sylvester D Judd in a paper entitled Sex ual Dimorphism in Crustacea limited himself to the Amphipoda He stated that while in certain genera the males and females were very similar there were other genera where second ary sexual characters were so marked that different sexes of the same species might be thought by the casual observer to belong to dif ferent genera The anterior and posterior parts of Amphipoda are the parts that present sec ondary sexual characters The antennae are particularly subject to variation in some 629 species the inferior antenna is several times as long in the male as it is in the female In other species the caudal end of the body of the male is monstrously developed The hairs that occur on the anterior and posterior parts of the body are differently disposed thus only in the males of Byblis do the antennal hairs form brushlike tufts and in a number of other genera the hairs on the antennae of the males are modi fied into elaborate sense organs called calceoli It appears that the parts of the body of Amphip oda which exhibit secondary sexual characters often coincide with those parts upon which specific differentise are founded F A LUCAS Secretary ZOOLOGICAL CLUB UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO MEETING MARCH 4 I Cleavage of the Egg of Arenicola The cleavage belongs to the type known as spiral or better oblique There is considerable yolk in the egg and it is almost evenly distributed before segmentation In the fourcell stage there are three smaller cells and one very large one representing nearly half the entire egg All the cells contain yolk The two cross furrows on the upper and lower poles of the egg are parallel and are formed by the blasto meres B and D the crossfurrow at the lower pole is much longer than the other however and is perfectly constant up to a stage shortly before the closure of the blastopore thus afford ing an invaluable means of orientation The future median plane passes at right angles to this furrow and thus forms an angle of 45 with each of the first two cleavage planes The upper pole forms the anterior end and the lower pole the posterior end of the worm Ectoblasts mesoblasts and entoblasts are formed in the usual way The cells X and M vid Wilson Nereis are by far the largest cells in the egg Primary trochoblasts sixteen in number arise from first quartet and are supplemented later by three cells from each of the small micromeres of the second quartet which complete the prototroch except dorsally where a break is left Through this space four cells derivatives of the first quartet pass and come to lie posteriorly to the pototroch The APRIL 16 1897630 SCLENCE first bilaterally symmetrical division in the egg 58cell stage is the fourth division of the blasto meres of the first quartet viz the formation of the apical cross of eight cells There are no headkidneys and the cell corresponding to the nephroblast remains on the surface as a small inconspicuous ectodermal cell The ventral or somatic plate grows as in Amphitrite The second bilaterally symmetrical division in the egg is the third division of the large posterior cell X A smaller cell is given off anteriorly and lies across the median plane The somatic plate broadens laterally and pos teriorly the lateral portions growing posteriorly faster than does the central portion so that finally the cells along the posterior edge begin to meet in the median line just dorsal to the blasto pore The point where this concrescence begins is the point where the paratroch appears This organ is formed from derivatives of X but by an entirely different set of divisions from those which take place in Amphitrite according to Dr Meads very kind personal communication Within the paratroch are enclosed certain small cells which later become the proctodaeum The first bilaterally symmetrical division of the mesoblast occurs at the seventycell stage In the entomeres a fifth quartet is formed and the three cells of the fourth quartet divide bilater ally No further divisions occur before the closure of the blastopore The first bilateral division in the small ecto meres in the large X cell in the mesoblast and in the entomeres all occur at very different periods in development but in the same generation of cells viz the eighth counting the unseg mented egg as the first Gastrulation is a combination of invagination and epiboly The mesoblast shows the first sign of invagination then the entomeres also elongate inward until they form a column ex tending to the ectoderm of the upper pole Now the ectomeres overgrow their lower sur face from the sides and ventrally forming a triangular blastopore with its short base directed ventrally The cells forming the lateral and ventral lips of the blastopore are twelve deriva tives of the third quartet of ectomeres and later form the stomodaeum The proctodeeal region should probably be regarded as a part of the N S VOL V No 120 blastopore for it is originally continuous with the rest of the opening lIt becomes separated from the stomodaeum by the posteroanterior concrescence of the somatic plate The gastrula is bilaterally symmetrical and its axis corre sponds to none of the principal axes of the adult During the closure of the blastopore the meso blast bands are forming in the interior of the egg In this case we have an actual change of the plane of the mesoblast bands through nearly 90 i e from nearly dorsoventral to longi tudinal The first cells of the bands are given off almost ventrally but with each successive division of the mesoblasts the direction of the spindle is more nearly longitudinal with respect to the egg until finally the cells of the bands arise anteriorly from the mesoblasts A word concerning the cleavage of Sternaspis scutata may be added here This was worked out as far as the 80cell stage by the author of this paper and corresponds cell for cell with that of Arenicola differing however as regards size and structure of blastomeres and order of their formation Sixteen relatively large cells corresponding to the primary trochoblasts of Arenicola are formed but Sternaspis possesses no prototroch and these cells form part of the ectoderm II The Oblique Cleavage and its Relation to the Mosaic Theory After a review of the positions held by Roux E B Wilson Driesch Hertwig etc the following arguments were given against the mosaic theory as applied to the oblique cleavage 1 The failure of cellhomology in a rapidly increasing number of cases 2 The very different size and structure in different species of blastomores which have the same normal fate 3 Experimental work Professor Wilson and Mr Crampton err in regarding the experiments of the latter on Ilyanassa as supporting the mosaic theory for in most cases  regeneration occurs Mr Crampton himself states in the text that in i and l embryos the endoderm cells are completely overgrown by ectoderm and also gives figures illustrating the same fact It is of course impossible for ectoderm cells which normally cover only the outer surface of cerSCIENCE tain endoderm cells to overgrow in the i and  embryo all sides of these cells and thus com pletely enclose them unless regeneration or postgeneration occurs Consequently Mr Cramptons socalled i and i embryos have at least made an attempt to become whole em bryos and Crampton and Wilson are wrong when they state that the power of regenera tion  or  postgeneration  is entirely absent A number of other points in this work were mentioned as affording evidence against instead of for the mosaic theory even as modified by Wilson In general terms the oblique cleavage is of course the result of the organization of the egg It may be pointed out that it is the form of cleavage which brings each cell into contact with the greatest number of other cells It is certainly not  mechanical in Wilsons sense for even the constant direction of obliquity cannot be explained in this way 0 Hertwigs view of the organization of the egg cannot be regarded as sufficient to explain the facts Examples were given showing the extreme differences in the allotment of yolk in different species even when the yolk was simi larly placed in the unsegmented egg There is an organization more fundamental than the visible one which governs both the form of cleavage and the position of yolk in the blas tomeres The egg appears to be a complex of sub stances possessing the power to produce an embryo and through this an adult by a series of processes not as yet understood Visible locali zation in the egg or early cleavage stages which is only a localization of protoplasm and deutoplasm does not necessarily imply a corre sponding location of the morphogenetic factors The facts rather appear to indicate that what we call the morphogenetic factors are the pro cesses going on in the egg as a whole Any strictly cellular theory of development must be inadequate as Dr Whitman has shown In the final analysis the organization of the egg is dependent on the structure of the idio plasm This would seem to favor Dr Whit mans view that the egg has a definite organi zation from the start The localization of protoplasm and deutoplasm however which 631 we find in the mature egg must be acquired during ovigenesis C M CHILD TORREY BOTANICAL CLUB MARCH 9 1897 THE Secretary announced the conditions of a grant now offered from the funds left by Pro fessor Newberry for encouragement of research to be supplied successively to zoology botany geology and paleontology For the present year the award is offered in geology or paleon tology to amount to 5000 payable July 15 1897 the competitors to belong to the Scientific Alliance of New York City The scientific program was then taken up the evening being devoted to the subject of ferns with papers as follows 1 Mrs Elizabeth G Britton Notes on some Mexican Ferns presented in Mrs Brittons absence by Dr Rusby with exhibition of nu merous specimens including species of Pellea Polypodium Cystopteris and Cheilanthes Dr Rusby having been himself present at their collection described vividly the tongue of hard black lava on which the collectors walked and which was filled with large cavities often form ing caves containing some accumulation of soil and crowded with a luxuriant growth of ferns although in November and practically the win ter season 2 Mr Willard N Clute The New York Stations for Scolopendrium Mr Clute con trasted the wide distribution of the Harts tongue fern in the old world from the Azores to Japan with the extremely local North American occurrence in five areas only Mexico Tennessee central New York Owen Sound in Ontario and New Brunswick The central New York locality was made known early in the present century through John Williamson and was visited by Pursh in July 1807 who found it five miles west of Syracuse on the farm of J Geddes where it has recently been rediscovered About 1827 Wm Cooper discovered it at Chittenango Falls where Mr Clute found hundreds of plants growing last summer Mr Clute described the Chittenango ravine and its ferns On sunny exposures of the limestone walls of the ravine grow rue spleenwort and purple cliffbrake in APRIL 16 1897632 SCIENCE quantities in shady places the slender cliff brake on the talus upon the larger bowlders the walking fern and in the shade of these bowlders the Scolopendrium chiefly in clus ters of 2 to 6 at first erect finally somewhat drooping and ripe in September Mr Clute added that the species seems to be increasing at present being now under the protection of an association 3 The third paper was by Mr B D Gilbert of Utica N Y entitled New and interesting Ferns from Bolivia with exhibition of speci mens of two new ferns a species of Blechnum and a new variety of Nephrodium villosum the first peculiar in being fully pinnate the second in being a onesided dwarf persistently under a foot and a half high instead of 4 or 5 feet as its type 4 The fourth paper also by Mr Gilbert Jamaica the FernLovers Paradise de scribed the abundance of species and of indi viduals which the speaker had collected there illustrating the subject by numerous specimens He remarked that Swartz in his Species Filicum 17836 enumerating all thenknown ferns de scribed 709 species of which 149 were from Jamaica the Jamaican number was raised to 300 by Grisebach and now to 500 by resident botanists there an estimate confirmed by Mr Gilbert Probably no other equal area pro duces half that number Among reasons which account for this are the warm latitude of Jamaica its south shore sheltered from cooler breezes by a mountain wall its mountains themselves rising to 7000 feet and reaching into a cool temperature climate and its great variation in moisture with daily rains in the mountains and sometimes but twice in six months on the plain EDWARD S BURGESS Secretary BOSTON SOCIETY OF NATURAL HISTORY A GENERAL meeting was held January 2 1897 fortythree persons present Professor W 0 Crosby gave an account of the dikelike masses of sandstone that occur in the granite of the Pikes Peak massif in the Ute Pass Colorado For an Abstract see SCIENCE page 604 above N S VOL V No 120 The Society met February 3d one hundred and six persons present Mr William C Bates spoke of Venezuela and British Guiana giving a brief historical ac count of their discovery and describing with the aid of a series of stereopticon views various points of interest connected with their natural history scenery and people SAMUEL HENSHAW Secretary THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCE OF ST LOUIS AT the meeting of the Academy of Science of St Louis held on the evening of April 5 1897 Professor Frederick Starr of the University of Chicago briefly addressed the Academy on the functi6ns of such organizations with especial reference to local problems Mr H C Irish presented a paper on the relations of the un folding of plants in spring to meteorological conditions in which were embodied deductions drawn from a series of observations made at the Missouri Botanical Garden and those by other observers extending back to the time of Stillingfleet in the last century Hr Charles Robertson presented for publication a paper entitled North American BeesDescriptions and Synonyms WM TRELEASE Secretary SCIENCE CLUB OF THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN AT the regular meeting of the Club held March 11th the only paper of the evening was by Wm B Miller on Pulmonary Architec ture The object of the paper was to show that in the structure of the lung there is a de finite relation of the bronchi blood and lymph vessels to each other and that there is to be found in the lung the same as in the liver in testines and other organs a unit which repeats itself throughout the entire organ and that when this unit is understood there is little difficulty in understanding the whole organ The paper was illustrated by means of numer ous models macroscopic and microscopic prep arations WM S MARSHALL Secretary

EXTRADITIONFLIGHTDEPARTURE FROM STATE AFTER ACT IN FURTHER ANCE OF CRIME SUBSEQUENTLY CONSUMMATEDThe petitioner was ar rested by Alabama authorities on a requisition of the governor of Mich igan founded upon affidavit charging the petitioner with having de serted his wife and family in Michigan on the 22nd day of December 1918 As a matter of fact the petitioner was not in the State of Michi gan on that date having left on the 21st of December 1918 He therefore brought this writ of habeas corpus claiming his detention to be illegal Held petition dismissed Ex parte Forbes Ala App 85 So 590 In extradition proceedings a requisition of the executive authority of a State accompanied by a sworn copy of the accusation and a warrant of the governor of the surrendering State authorizing arrest creates a presumption that a crime has been committed in the demanding State and where habeas corpus is resorted to makes out a prima facie case that the prisoner is legally held Godwin v State 16 Ala App 397 78 So 313 In re Van Sciever 42 Neb 772 60 N W 1037 47 Am St Rep 730 But it is the general rule that for a person to be a fugitive from justice it must be affirmatively shown that he was actually with in the State from which a demand for his surrender comes at the time at which the crime is alleged to have been committed Farrell v Hawley 78 Conn 150 61 Atl 502 70 L R A 686 112 Am St

after the commission of an act in furtherance of a crime sub sequently consummated it is a flight from justice and renders the fugi tive liable to extradition Strassheim v Daily 221 U S 280 In re

PROCEEDINGSAGREEMENT TO RESUME MARITAL RELATIONSThe plaintiff brought a suit against her husband for an absolute divorce on the ground of adultery While the suit was pending she discontinued it and resumed her relations with her hus band in consideration of the agreement of her husband and his father to pay her an annuity each month during the remainder of her life She lived with her husband until his death A portion of the money had been paid her and this action was brought against the father to re cover what was due and owing her under the contract Held she can recover Rodgers v Rodgers N Y 128 N E 117 150RECENT DECISIONS Matrimonial cohabitation is a duty imposed by law and a promise by either party to pay the other for performing this duty is a nudum pactum and therefore unenforceable since an agreement to do what one is legally bound to do is without consideration Such an agreement is also contrary to sound public policy because it is promotive of sepa ration between husband and wife Miller v Miller 78 Iowa 177 35 N W 464 42 N W 641 16 Am St Rep 431 Michigan Trust Co v Chapin 106 Mich 384 64 N W 334 58 Am St Rep 490 Consequently an agreement by a husband to pay money to his wife if she will live with him is void as without consideration Copeland v Boaz 9 Baxt Tenn 223 40 Am Rep 89 Roberts v Frisby 38 Tex 220 Nothing is said in the reports of these two cases to indicate whether or not di vorce proceedings had been commenced or were pending The consideration of a note given to induce a wife to return to her husband is illegal even though the wife had left her husband for good cause entitling her to a divorce and had consulted counsel with a view to obtaining a divorce Actual proceedings however had not been in stituted for a divorce Merrill v Peaslee 146 Mass 460 16 N E 271 4 Am St Rep 334 note the strong dissenting opinion The majority opinion was to the effect that matrimonial cohabitation cannot be made an article of trade and is without the range of pecuniary considera tions The judgment of the majority expressly guarded itself against expressing an opinion as to the legality of an agreement not to prose cute proceedings for a divorce The same court has since decided that the forbearance from bringing a wellfounded suit for divorce is a suffi cient and legal consideration to support an action by the wife against the husband upon his failure to keep his contract Polson v Stewart 167 Mass 211 45 N E 737 36 L R A 771 57 Am St Rep 452 Where a wife refrains from carrying out an oral unexecuted threat to institute a suit for divorce and returns to live with her husband thereafter and there is no action for divorce pending it has been held that there is no consideration for an agreement on the part of the hus band to cancel an antenuptial contract Fisher v Koontz 110 Iowa 498 80 N W 551 There is a sufficient and valid consideration when the agreement between the husband and the wife is that the wife shall abandon a pending suit for divorce and renew her marital relations with her hus band Reithmaier v Beckwith 35 Mich 109 Barbour v Barbour 49 N J Eq 429 24 Atl 227 It would seem therefore that the principal case is in agreement with the authorities and certainly it accords with sound reason and a wise public policy INCOME TAXDEDUCTIONSLOSSES SUSTAINED IN OUTSIDE SPECULATION LossEs INCURRED IN TRADEThe

J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,106862,ON THE RATE OF TRAVELLING AS PERFORMED BY CAMELS AND ITS APPLICATION AS A SCALE TO THE PURPOSES OF GEOGRAPHY BY JAMES RENNELL ESQ F R S,I206946,P H I L O S O P H I C A L T R A N S A C T I O N S VIII ON THE RATE OF TRAVELLING AS PERFORMED BY CAMELS AND ITS APPLICATION AS A SCALE TO THE PURPOSES OF GEOGRAPHY BY JAMES RENNELL ESQ F R S READ MARCH 17 1791 AMONGST THE DISCOVERIES AND IMPROVEMENTS OF VARIOUS KINDS THAT MAY BE EXPECTED FROM THE VERY LAUDABLE AND AS IT CONCERNS MANKIND IN THE GROSS NO LESS HUMANE AND BENE VOLENT INSTITUTION OF AN ASSOCIATION FOR PROMOTING DIS COVERIES IN THE INTERIOR PARTS OF AFRICA THAT OF THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE CONTINENT IN QUESTION MAY BE EXPECTED TO MAKE THE QUICKEST PROGRESS SINCE IN EVERY KIND OF DISTANT RESEARCH WHETHER SUCCESSFUL OR OTHERWISE THE ACT OF ENQUIRY ALONE BRINGS MATERIALS TO THE GEOGRAPHER BUT EVEN WITH EVERY VOL LXXXI T ORDINARY130 MR RENNELL ON THE RATE OF ORDINARY ADVANTAGE THE GEOGRAPHY OF A CONTINENT MUST NECES SARILY BE SLOW IN ITS PROGRESS TOWARDS MATURITY WE THEREFORE CAN ONLY EXPECT TO WITNESS ITS EARLY INFANCY AND CANNOT FROM A VIEW OF THE PRESENT ALLOW OURSELVES TO PREDICT WHAT ITS FUTURE FEATURES MAY BE LET IT BE OUR CARE HOWEVER TO FOSTER IT AND CONTRIBUTE ALL WITHIN OUR POWER TOWARDS ITS IMPROVE MENT AND PERFECTION IN A CASE WHERE THERE IS SO LITTLE PROBABILITY EVEN IN A LONG COURSE OF TIME OF OBTAINING MANY FIXED POINTS BY CELESTIAL OBSERVATIONS THOUGH I HOPE THAT ONE AT LEAST WILL BE ATTEMPTED IN THE CENTRAL PART OF AFRICA IN OUR TIME IT IS FORTUNATE THAT THE MODE OF TRAVELLING HAPPENS TO BE SUCH AS SERVES TO FURNISH A REMARKABLY EQUAL SCALE THE RATE OF THE CAMELS MOVEMENT APPEARING TO BE BEYOND ALL OTHERS THE LEAST VARIABLE WHETHER WE EXAMINE IT BY PORTIONS OF DAYS OR OF HOURS IN THE PRESENT STATE OF THINGS THE FORMER MODE ALONE CAN BE USED BECAUSE FEW OR NONE OF THE AFRICAN TRAVELLERS CARRY WATCHES WITH THEM BUT IT MAY BE HOPED THAT AT NO VERY DISTANT PERIOD THE TIME EMPLOYED ON THE ROAD MAY BE OBTAINED WITH SUCH A DEGREE OF EXACTNESS AS TO FURNISH THE GEOGRAPHER WITH MATERIALS OF A FAR BETTER KIND THAN ANY OF THOSE FORMED ON COMPUTATION THAT HAVE HITHERTO BEEN EXHIBITED THESE REMARKS OCCURRED ON THE RESULT OF AN EXAMINATION WHICH THOUGH FOR A DIFFERENT PURPOSE I LATELY MADE INTO THE RATE OF THE CAMELS MOVEMENT ON THE ARABIAN DESERT BETWEEN ALEPPO BAGDAD AND BUSSORAH FOR IT APPEARED TO ME THAT IF THE AFRICAN CARAVANS ARE COMPOSED OF THE SAME KIND OF CAMELS AND ARE GOVERNED IN THEIR MOTIONS AND OECONOMY BY THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES AS THOSE WHICH CROSS THE ARABIAN DESERTS THERE IS NO SCALE OF THE COMPUTED KIND THAT CAN BE MORE APPLICABLE TO THE AFRICAN GEOGRAPHY THAN THAT FORMED ON THE CAMELS RATE OFTRAVELLING AS PERFORMED BY CAMELS 131 OF TRAVELLING I SHALL THEREFORE DETAIL THE EXAMPLES FROM WHENCE I HAVE DRAWN THE PROPORTIONS FOR THE HOURS AND DAYS JOURNEY OF THE CAMEL UNDER THE TWO DIFFERENT DEGREES OF BUR THEN WHICH CONSTITUTE WHAT IS COMMONLY DENOMINATED THE LIGHT AND THE HEAVY CARAVAN THE ROUTES WHICH FURNISH THE ABOVE EXAMPLES ARE DETERMINED IN THEIR HORIZONTAL OR DIRECT DISTANCE BY THE RESPECTIVE POSI TIONS OF ALEPPO BAGDAD AND BUSSORAH ALL OF WHICH HAVE THEIR LATITUDES AND LONGITUDES FIXED BY CELESTIAL OBSERVA TIONS  THESE ROUTES ARE FIVE IN NUMBER AND ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE JOURNALS THAT DESCRIBE THEM CONTAIN LESS INFORMATION THAN OTHERS YET ALL OF THEM HAVE THE TIME GIVEN WITH A SUFFI CIENT DEGREE OF PRECISION TO ENABLE ME TO FOUND A GENERAL RULE ON THREE OF THESE ROUTES LEAD ACROSS THE GREAT DESERT OR THAT BETWEEN ALEPPO AND BUSSORAH THE OTHER TWO ARE ACROSS THE LITTLE DESERT OR THAT BETWEEN ALEPPO AND BAGDAD THE FIRST OF THE GREAT DESERT ROUTES WAS TRACED BY A MR CAR MICHAEL IN 1751 THE MANUSCRIPT COPY OF HIS JOURNAL WAS OBLIGINGLY COMMUNICATED BY MY FRIEND DR PATRICK RUSSELL AND IT MANIFESTS A GREAT DEGREE OF INGENUITY AND PERSEVERANCE IN THIS WAY THE AUTHOR DECLARES THAT HE WAS DETERMINED TO KEEP A REGISTER OF THE COURSES BY A COMPASS AND TO COMPUTE COMPARATIVELY IF NOT ABSOLUTELY THE INTERMEDIATE DISTANCE ON EACH COURSE BY COUNTING THE STEPS OR PACES OF THE CAMEL ON WHICH HE RODE DURING A CERTAIN INTERVAL OF TIME AND AFTER WARDS MEASURING A NUMBER OF THEM ON THE GROUND THE PARTICULARS OF THIS OPERATION SHALL BE GIVEN HEREAFTER AND  ALEPPO IN CONN DES TEMPS LAT 36O 11 LONG 37O 9 RECKONED FROM GREENWICH BAGDAD BY M BEAUCHAMP LAT 33O 22 LONG 44O 21 GREENWICH BUSSORAH BY CAPT RITCHIE LAT 30O 30 LONG 47O 33 GREENWICH T 2 ALTHOUGH132 MR RENNELL ON THE RATE OF ALTHOUGH MR CARMICHAEL FAILED IN THE ATTEMPT TO ASCERTAIN HIS ROAD DISTANCE BY THIS METHOD YET HIS PROCESS HAS FURNISHED OTHERS WITH THE MEANS OF ASCERTAINING THE WHOLE DISTANCE IN THE AGGRE GATE AND OF PROPORTIONING THE PARTS THROUGHOUT FOR AS THE DIRECT DISTANCE IS GIVEN BY THE CELESTIAL OBSERVATIONS AND A COMPLETE TRAVERSE TABLE BY THE JOURNAL THE DATA ARE PERFECT AND WHEN THE READER IS INFORMED THAT MR CARMICHAELS WHOLE LINE OF BEARING BY COMPASS BETWEEN ALEPPO AND BUSSORAH NEARLY 720 BRITISH MILES COINCIDED WITH THE BEARING LINE GIVEN BY THE CELESTIAL OBSERVATIONS BY WHICH IT APPEARS THAT THE ERROR COULD AMOUNT ONLY TO THE MEAN QUANTITY OF THE VARIATION THROUGHOUT WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN FROM SIX TO SEVEN DEGREES AT THAT TIME 1751 HE WILL GIVE MR CARMICHAEL CREDIT FOR MUCH GENERAL ACCURACY AND IT IS NOT IMPROBABLE THAT EVEN A CONSI DERABLE PORTION OF THE ABOVE ERROR MAY HAVE ARISEN FROM THE IMPERFECTION OF HIS INSTRUMENT  THE SECOND JOURNAL WAS KEPT BY COLONEL CAPPER IN 1778 AND WAS PUBLISHED SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND THE THIRD WHICH CONTAINS LITTLE MORE THAN THE TIME IN DETAIL WAS COMMUNICATED BY MY FRIEND MR HUNTER WHO CROSSED THE DESERT IN 1767 THE TIME GIVEN BETWEEN ALEPPO AND BUSSORAH BY THESE JOURNALS RESPECTIVELY IS AS FOLLOWS BY MR CARMICHAEL 322 HOURS COLONEL CAPPER 310 MR HUNTER 29912  I FIND BY MR DRUMMONDS CHART OF THE ROAD BETWEEN ALEPPO AND ANTIOCH 1747 THAT THE VARIATION WAS THEN ABOUT 6 DEGREES WESTERLY THIS IS PROVED BY COMPARING HIS MAGNETIC BEARING LINE BETWEEN THOSE PLACES WITH THAT GIVEN BY THE DIFFERENCE OF LATITUDE IN THE HEAD OF THE GULF OS PERSIA THE VARIATION WAS 7 DEGREES IN 1785 BUTTRAVELLING AS PERFORMED BY CAMELS 133 BUT TO SHEW THAT THIS DIFFERENCE AROSE CHIEFLY FROM THE VARIA TIONS IN THE ROUTE ACROSS THE CHALDEAN DESERT BETWEEN MESJID ALI AND BUSSORAH SEE THE ANNEXED SKETCH TAB III I SHALL PROCEED FIRST TO EXPLAIN THAT PART OF THE SUBJECT AND AFTERWARDS TO EXHIBIT THE PARTICULARS IN PROOF MESJID ALI OR ALIS MOSQUE IS SITUATED AT ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE DISTANCE AND AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE IN THE LINE OF DIRECTION BETWEEN ALEPPO AND BUSSORAH AND IS A SORT OF LANDMARK TO THE CARAVANS WHICH PASS THE COMMON BOUNDARY OF THE ARABIAN AND CHALDEAN DESERTS ITS GEOGRAPHICAL POSITION IS DEDUCED FROM BEARINGS AND LATITUDES TAKEN BY M NIEBUHR AND OTHERS AND THEREFORE AS FAR AS GENERAL GEOGRAPHY IS CONCERNED IT MAY ALMOST BE REGARDED AS A FIXED POINT NOT THAT THE TRUTH OF ITS POSITION WILL IN ANY SHAPE AFFECT THE PRESENT HEAD OF ENQUIRY WHICH IS ENTIRELY DIRECTED TOWARDS A COMPARISON OF THE SPACES OF TIME EMPLOYED BETWEEN CERTAIN POINTS OF THE ROUTE BY EACH TRAVELLER RESPECTIVELY NOW THAT PORTION OF THE DESERT ROUTE BETWEEN MESJID ALI AND BUSSORAH BEING SUBJECT TO GREAT VARIATION IN THE TRACK AS APPEARS BY THE JOURNALS OF DIFFERENT TRAVELLERS WHILST THE MUCH LARGER PORTION OF IT BETWEEN MESJID ALI AND ALEPPO IS VERY NEARLY THE SAME AT ALL TIMES IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT THIS LATTER PORTION FURNISHES THE PROPEREST GROUND ON WHICH TO FORM THE COMPARISON AND THE PARTICULARS ARE AS FOLLOW ALEPPO134 MR RENNELL ON THE RATE OF CARMI CAPPER HUNTER CHAEL H M H M H M ALEPPO TO HAGLA 11 5 11 24 10 0 HAGLA HAGLA TO AIN IL KOOM 37 30 41 4 35 0 TO TAIBA AIN IL KOOM TO UKLET HAURAN 80 10 78 41 81 30 TO UKLET HAURAN HAGLA TO UKLET HAURAN 117 40 119 45 116 30 UKLET HAURAN TO AL KADDER 53 50

LITTLE DESERT I HAVE TWO EXAMPLES OF TIME FROM MR IRWIN IN 1781 AND MR HOLFORD IN 1780 BOTH OF WHOM KEPT REGULAR JOURNALS IRWIN HOLFORD H M H M ALEPPO TO AIN IL KOOM 52 0 46 27 AIN IL KOOM TO ANNAH ON THE EUPHRATES 76 0 80 15 ALEPPO TO ANNAH 128 0 126 42 IT APPEARS BY THE JOURNALS THAT MR IRWIN DEVIATED FROM THE USUAL TRACK IN THE FIRST PART OF HIS ROUTE AND THAT MR HOLFORD DID THE LIKE IN THE LATTER PART OF HIS EACH TO AVOID AN ENEMY SO THAT IT MAY BE PRESUMED THAT THE DEVIATIONS NEARLY BALANCED EACH OTHER SEE THE SKETCH BETWEEN ANNAH AND BAGDAD THESE GENTLEMEN MADE PART OF THEIR JOURNEY IN THE CARAVAN OF LOADED CAMELS AND PARTLY WITH LIGHT CAMELS THAT IS WITHOUT ANY OTHER LOAD THAN THE RIDER MR IRWIN EMPLOYED 6212 HOURS BUT THE LAST 15 HOURS ON 2 LIGHTTRAVELLING AS PERFORMED BY CAMELS 135 LIGHT CAMELS WERE AT AN ACCELERATED RATE OF HALF A MILE PER HOUR OR ONE FIFTH PART ABOVE THE ORDINARY RATE ACCORDING TO HIS IDEA WHICH I HAVE NO DOUBT WAS A VERY JUST ONE AND THIS ACCELERATED RATE SHOULD ADD 3 HOURS TO THE 15 TO REDUCE IT TO CARAVAN TIME MAKING 6512 HOURS INSTEAD OF 6212 MR HOL FORDS JOURNEY BY THE SAME RATIO MUST BE RECKONED AT 68 BUT AS THIS PART OF THE TWO JOURNIES IS OBVIOUSLY TOO INACCURATE TO DRAW ANY CONCLUSIONS FROM IN THE WAY OF COMPARISON I SHALL ONLY MAKE USE OF MR IRWINS TIME TO WHICH NO SOLID OBJECTION CAN BE URGED WHEN I CALCULATE THE RATE OF THE CAMELS TRAVELLING WE HAVE NOW SEEN THAT ON A JOURNEY OF ABOUT 200 HOURS BETWEEN ALEPPO AND MESJID ALI TWO ACCOUNTS DIFFER ONLY 1 HOUR 24 MINUTES AND A THIRD DIFFERS FROM THE MEAN OF THE OTHER TWO SEVEN HOURS AND AN HALF AND WE MAY OBSERVE THAT IF THE STAGE FROM ALEPPO TO HAGLA BE TAKEN OUT OF THE QUESTION THE NUMBER OF MR HUNTERS HOURS WOULD BE NEARER ON AN EQUA LITY WITH THE OTHERS BY ABOUT AN HOUR AND A QUARTER SEE P 134 THE REASON OF THE DIFFERENT REPORTS OF THE DISTANCE BETWEEN ALEPPO AND HAGLA APPEARS TO BE THAT TRAVELLERS COM MONLY JOIN THE CARAVANS EITHER AT HAGLA OR ON THE ROAD TO IT AND THEY TRAVELLING BY A QUICKER CONVEYANCE THAN CAMELS AFFORD AND THEN ADJUSTING THE TIME TO THE CARAVAN RATE MAKE DIFFERENT ESTIMATES OF THE DISTANCE OR THERE MAY BE SOME OTHER CAUSE WHICH HAS NOT BEEN EXPLAINED FOUR DIFFERENT PERSONS GIVE THE TIME AS FOLLOWS H M H M CARMICHAEL 11 5 CAPPER 11 24 HUNTER 10 0 HOLFORD 9 12 SO THAT THE PROPER POINT OF OUTSET IN MAKING THE COMPARISON IS136 MR RENNELL ON THE RATE OF IS HAGLA AND RECKONING FROM THENCE WE HAVE IN THE FIRST TABLE P 134 THE NUMBERS 19314 19413 AND 18712 FOR THE TIME BETWEEN HAGLA AND MESJID ALI IN THE THREE JOURNIES RESPECTIVELY AND THE SAME TABLE AFFORDS ALSO THE FOLLOWING COM PARISONS BETWEEN DIFFERENT PLACES ON THE ROUTE IN ONE INSTANCE 8016 AND 7823 IN A SECOND 11723 11934 AND 11612 IN A THIRD 5334 5434 AND 5112 AND IN A FOURTH 17112 17412 AND 168 AGAIN BETWEEN ALEPPO AND ANNAH ON THE EUPHRATES THE NUMBERS IN THE SECOND TABLE STAND THUS 128 AND 12623 I THINK I NEED NOT PRODUCE ANY MORE EXAMPLES TO PROVE THE EQUAL RATE OF MOTION OF A CAMEL THAT IS IN ANY DEGREE LOADED OR RATHER OF A NUMBER OF CAMELS TOGETHER WHERE THE RATE WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE SLOWGOING ONES AND WHATSOEVER RATE IN ACTUAL DISTANCE MAY BE DEDUCED FROM THESE EXAMPLES MUST BE APPLIED TO LOADED CAMELS TRAVELLING IN A BODY TOGETHER AND NOT TO LIGHT CAMELS OR THOSE CHOSEN FOR SPEED WHOSE RATE APPEARS TO BE AT LEAST 15TH GREATER BY A LIGHT CAMEL IS MEANT ONE THAT HAS ONLY A MAN OR A VERY SMALL QUANTITY OF BAGGAGE ON IT WHEREAS A CAMELS LOAD IS 500 TO 600 POUNDS AND CAMELS SO LOADED FORM WHAT IS TERMED THE HEAVY CARAVAN LIGHT CARA VAN ON THE CONTRARY IS APPLIED TO CAMELS UNDER A MODERATE LOAD OR PERHAPS LITTLE MORE THAN HALF LOADED AND WITH RESPECT TO CAMELS EITHER MODERATELY OR FULLY LOADED I CAN PER CEIVE NO DIFFERENCE IN THEIR HOURLY RATE OF MOTION THE DIFFER ENCE ALONE APPEARS IN THE LENGTH OF THEIR DAYS JOURNEY AS WE SHALL PERCEIVE HEREAFTER A CAMEL IT IS SAID WILL NOT PERMIT HIMSELF TO BE OVERLADEN AND THIS MAY BE THE REASON WHY THE LOAD DOES NOT AFFECT HIS RATE OF MOTION ITTRAVELLING AS PERFORMED BY CAMELS 137 IT APPEARS THAT THE DIRECT DISTANCE BETWEEN ALEPPO AND BUSSORAH IS 621 GEOGRAPHIC MILES OR 720 BRITISH NEARLY AND MR CARMICHAELS ROUTE TRACED BY A COMPASS THROUGH ALL ITS PRINCIPAL BENDINGS AND CALCULATED TRIGONOMETRICALLY GIVES 688 GEOGRAPHIC MILES OR OF BRITISH 797 IT FOLLOWS THEN OF COURSE THAT AS THE SAME GENTLEMAN WAS 322 HOURS ON THE ROAD THE MEAN HOURLY RATE OF THE CAMELS MOTION WAS 2475 BRITISH MILES COLONEL CAPPERS ROUTE THOUGH EASILY TRACED ON THE MAP IS NOT CORRECT ENOUGH IN ITS PARTICULARS TO SERVE AS AN AUTHORITY EQUAL TO MR CARMICHAELS AND THE LIKE MAY BE SAID OF MR HUNTERS BUT THEY MUST BOTH BE ALLOWED TO COR ROBORATE MR CARMICHAELS IN A GENERAL WAY FOR AS NEARLY AS COLONEL CAPPERS ROUTE CAN BE TRACED OVER THE CHALDEAN DESERT AND AS WE HAVE BEFORE OBSERVED THE TRACK IS NEARLY THE SAME AT ALL TIMES IN ALL OTHER PARTS OF THE DESERT THE HOURLY RATE OF HIS CAMELS WAS 251 PER HOUR AND THAT OF MR HUNTERS 2585 WE COME NOW TO THE LITTLE DESERT ROUTE IT HAS BEEN NOTICED THAT MR IRWIN EMPLOYED 128 HOURS ON HIS JOURNEY FROM ALEPPO TO ANNAH AND 6512 MORE ALLOWING FOR HIS ACCE LERATED RATE 3 HOURS SEE P 135 BETWEEN ANNAH AND BAGDAD ALTOGETHER 19312 HOURS BETWEEN ALEPPO AND BAGDAD THE DIRECT DISTANCE BETWEEN THOSE PLACES IS 393 GEOGRAPHIC MILES AND BY THE ROUTE TRACED BY MR IRWIN THE ROAD DISTANCE COMES OUT ABOUT 41412 OR BRITISH MILES 480  AND THIS NUMBER DIVIDED BY 19312 GIVES 248 PER HOUR FOR THE CAMELS RATE OR  NOT THAT THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THOSE PLACES IS SO MUCH AS 480 MILES BY THE DIRECT ROAD IT IS PROBABLY LESS THAN 470 BUT MR IRWINS PARTY TOOK A CIR CUITOUS COURSE TO THE SOUTHWARD BETWEEN ALEPPO AND AIN IL KOOM TO AVOID AN ENEMY THAT LAY IN THE WAY HE ESTIMATED HIS DISTANCE AT 493 MILES VOL LXXXI U WITHIN138 MR RENNELL ON THE RATE OF WITHIN A VERY SMALL FRACTION OF MR CARMICHAELS RATE HIS BEING AS WE HAVE JUST SEEN 2475 I THINK I MAY VENTURE TO REST THE CALCULATION OF THE LOADED CAMELS MEAN HOURLY RATE OF TRAVELLING ON THE EXPERIMENTS OF MR CARMICHAEL AND OF MR IRWIN BOTH OF WHOM APPEAR TO HAVE TAKEN MUCH PAINS WITH THE DETAIL OF THEIR JOURNIES  AND THEN IT WILL STAND AS UNDER MR CARMICHAEL ON 322 HOURS 2475 MEAN 2478 BRI MR IRWIN ON 19312 248 TISH MILES WE HAVE MENTIONED ABOVE THE RESULT OF COLONEL CAPPERS AND OF MR HUNTERS TIME WHICH GAVE A RATE SO VERY NEAR TO CARMICHAELS AND IRWINS AND IT MAY NOT BE AMISS TO ADD TO THESE THE RESULT OF MR HOLFORDS AS WELL AS THE ESTIMATES OF THE CAMELS RATE FORMED BY SEVEN DIFFERENT PERSONS ALL THESE I HAVE PLACED IN ONE POINT OF VIEW IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE CARMI IRWIN CAPPER HUNTER HOL PLAISTED ANONY CHAEL FORD MOUS BRIT MI ESTIMATED RATES 229 255 225 233 224 23 25 EXPERIMENTS 2475 248 251 2585 25   MEAN OF THE SEVEN ESTIMATES 235 MEAN OF THE FIVE EXPERIMENTS 251 MEAN OF CARMICHAELS AND IRWINS 2478  MR IRWIN ALSO TOOK THE BEARINGS OF HIS COURSE BY A COMPASS THOUGH NOT SO MUCH IN DETAIL AS MR CARMICHAEL BUT MR IRWIN NOT ONLY REMARKED THE TIME BUT THE PARTICULAR RATE OF TRAVELLING ON EACH DAY WHICH APPEARED TO VARY FROM 2 TO 3 PER HOUR BUT WAS COMMONLY 212 AND THE MEAN OF ALL 255 BRITISH MILES BEFORETRAVELLING AS PERFORMED BY CAMELS 139 BEFORE I QUIT THE SUBJECT OF THE HOURLY RATE I SHALL OBSERVE THAT THE ROAD DISTANCES IN MR CARMICHAELS TRAVERSE TABLE ARE OFTEN THROWN TOGETHER IN LINES OF VERY CONSIDERABLE LENGTH SUCH AS 20 MILES AND UPWARDS AND VERY COMMONLY IN LINES OF 5 6 AND 7 AND YET ARE ALL CONSIDERED AS STRAIGHT LINES BY THIS MODE IT IS PROBABLE THAT MANY SMALL INFLEXIONS PASSED UNNOTICED AND THEREFORE THE RATE TAKEN FROM THE RESULTS OF CARMICHAELS AND IRWINS OBSERVATIONS WILL BE RATHER UNDER THE MARK THAN OTHERWISE BUT IT IS OBVIOUS THAT NO KIND OF RULE CAN BE FOUND TO CORRECT IT BY IT IS CERTAIN THAT FEWER INFLEXIONS ARE LIKELY TO OCCUR IN THE DESERT ROUTES THAN IN ALMOST ANY OTHER NOT TO MENTION THAT THE LONG LINES OF DISTANCE HAP PEN CHIEFLY IN THE OPEN LEVEL PART OF THE ROUTE THE ROAD DISTANCE EXCEEDS THE DIRECT DISTANCE BY ONEFOURTEENTH PART OF THE LATTER ONLY BETWEEN ALEPPO AND MESJID ALI AMOUNTING TO A FRACTION OF 168 BRITISH MILE ON EACH HOUR OR IN THE PROPOR TION OF 714 MILES ON EACH HUNDRED OF DIRECT DISTANCE THIS I CONFESS IS MUCH LESS THAN I COULD POSSIBLY HAVE SUPPOSED AND WHICH NOTHING SHORT OF ACTUAL EXPERIMENT COULD HAVE INDUCED ME TO BELIEVE ON THE WHOLE ROAD BETWEEN ALEPPO AND BUS SORAH THE PROPORTION IS NEARLY 11 ON EACH HUNDRED ON CARMI CHAELS ROUTE BUT HIS ROUTE OVER THE CHALDEAN DESERT WAS UNUSUALLY CIRCUITOUS AND CANNOT BE ADMITTED TO HAVE ANY WEIGHT IN THE DETERMINATION OF THIS QUESTION ONE WOULD EXPECT THAT THE INFLEXIONS OF WHICH NO ACCOUNT IS TAKEN BY MR CARMICHAEL WOULD AMOUNT TO AT LEAST HALF AS MUCH AS THOSE WHICH ARE TAKEN NOTICE OF AND SUCH ADDITION WOULD MAKE THE WHOLE HOURLY RATE 256 INSTEAD OF 2475 BUT THIS IS MERELY A SUPPOSITION AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE RATE MAY NOT BE HIGHER THAN 252 THE MEAN OF THE FOUR OTHER EXPERI U 2 MENTS140 MR RENNELL ON THE RATE OF MENTS AT ALL EVENTS THE ERROR CAN BE BUT SMALL AND POSSI BLY ALL CIRCUMSTANCES TAKEN INTO THE CASE AND PARTICULARLY THIS REMARKABLE ONE THAT OF THREE PERSONS WHO ATTEMPTED TO ASCERTAIN THE RATE BY COUNTING AND MEASURING THE CAMELS FOOT STEPS NONE RECKONED IT HIGHER THAN 213 AND ONE WENT SO LOW AS 214 I THINK THE RATE OF TWO MILES AND AN HALF PER HOUR MAY BE USED AS DIFFERING BUT A SHADE FROM THE GENERAL RESULT AND AS HAVING THE MOST MANAGEABLE FRACTION THUS IT APPEARS TO ME THAT THE HOURLY RATE OF THE CAMEL MAY BE APPLIED AS A VERY USEFUL SCALE TO THE AFRICAN GEOGRAPHY WHENSOEVER THE USE OF WATCHES SHALL BE ADOPTED BY THE NATIVE TRAVELLERS EMPLOYED BY THE AFRICAN ASSOCIATION  AND WITH STILL GREATER ADVANTAGE OF COURSE IF EUROPEANS ARE EMPLOYED AND IF MR CARMICHAEL COULD DESCRIBE THE GENERAL BEARING ON A LINE OF MORE THAN 700 BRITISH MILES SO NEARLY AS WITHIN 6 OR 7 DEGREES OF THE TRUTH AND THAT WITH A POCKET COMPASS NOTHING MORE NEED BE SAID CONCERNING THE ADVANTAGES THAT MAY BE DERIVED FROM THE USE OF THAT VALUABLE INSTRUMENT AIDED BY SUCH A SCALE AS I HAVE BEEN DESCRIBING THE MEAN LENGTH OF THE DAYS JOURNEY OF THE CAMEL VARIES ACCORDING TO THE DEGREE IN WHICH IT IS LOADED AND IN THIS PARTI CULAR IT IS THAT THE STATE OF THE CAMEL AS TO ITS BURTHEN OPE RATES ON ITS PROGRESS IT IS NECESSARY TO OBSERVE THAT WHATSO EVER REMARKS I MAY OFFER ON THE SUBJECT OF THE CAMELS DAYS JOURNEY ARE MEANT TO BE APPLIED ONLY TO THE MEAN RATE ON JOUR NIES OF CONSIDERABLE LENGTH SINCE ANY OTHER KIND OF EXPERIMENT WOULD BE OF NO USE IN GEOGRAPHY I SHALL THEREFORE CONSIDER ONLY THE PROGRESS OF THE LIGHT AND HEAVY CARAVANS IN WHICH  IN THE MEMOIRS OF ABDUL KURRIM A CASHMERIAN OF DISTINCTION HE INFORMS US THAT HE KEPT AN ACCOUNT OF THE TIME ON THE ROAD BETWEEN BAGDAD AND MECCA BY MEANS OF AN EUROPEAN WATCH IN THE YEAR 1740 THETRAVELLING AS PERFORMED BY CAMELS 141 THE CAMELS ARE LEFT TO PURSUE THEIR JOURNEY QUIETLY AND AT LEI SURE AND WITH THE REGULARITY OF A MACHINE AND NOT THAT OF THE LIGHT CAMELS WHICH ARE NOT ONLY FREED FROM INCUM BRANCE BUT ARE ALSO URGED ON I HAVE TWO EXAMPLES OF THE HEAVY KIND AND THREE OF THE LIGHT KIND WHERE THE TIME HAS BEEN REGULARLY KEPT BESIDES A THIRD EXAMPLE OF THE HEAVY KIND WHERE THE NECESSARY REGULARITY IS WANTING BUT YET CONTAINING WITHIN ITSELF EVIDENCE SUFFI CIENTLY STRONG TO CORROBORATE THE OTHER TWO THE HEAVY CARAVANS WERE THOSE OF MR CARMICHAEL AND M HOLFORD THE FIRST OF 1000 CAMELS OF WHICH 600 WERE LOADED WENT ON A JOURNEY OF 45 DAYS AT A H M MEAN EACH DAY 7 10 THE SECOND WITH 50 LOADED CAMELS ON A JOURNEY OF 15 DAYS 7 40 MEAN OF THE TWO 7 25 THE THIRD TEIXEIRA WITH 130 LOADED CAMELS ON A JOURNEY OF 21 DAYS ABOUT 7 30 MEAN OF ALL PER DAY 7 27 THE LIGHT CARAVANS WERE H M MESS IRWIN 21 DAYS 9 12 FROM 80 TO 100 CAPPER 33  8 38 CAMELS HUNTER 34  8 45 MEAN OF THE THREE 8 52 HERE THEN THE MEAN OF THE HEAVY CARAVAN DAY IS UNDER SEVEN HOURS AND AN HALF AND THAT OF THE LIGHT CARAVAN BETWEEN EIGHT AND THREE QUARTERS AND NINE HOURS SOME142 MR RENNELL ON THE RATE OF SOME OF THE ORDINARY WATERING PLACES ON THE DESERT BEING FROM 3 TO 5 DAYS JOURNEY ASUNDER IT MAY BE SUPPOSED THAT THE LENGTH OF THE INTERMEDIATE JOURNIES WOULD BE DETERMINED BY THE KNOWN AND APPROVED STANDARD OF A PROPER DAYS WALK FOR A CAMEL FOR AS THEY OFTEN ARRIVE AT THE WATERINGPLACE EARLY IN THE DAY IT APPEARS THAT THE CARAVAN CHIEFS DO NOT BY ANY MEANS DIVIDE THE GROUND BETWEEN SUCH WATERING PLACES INTO EQUAL PORTIONS FOR MARCHES THIS BEING THE CASE ONE MAY EXPECT TO ARRIVE AT THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT IS AT LEAST INTENDED FOR A PROPER DAYS JOURNEY FOR A CAMEL UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE AND INDEED THE RESULT IS SUCH AS TO PROVE WHAT I HAVE BEFORE ADVANCED RESPECTING THE LENGTH OF THE MEAN JOURNIES OF BOTH KINDS FOR HAVING SELECTED FROM THE FIVE ABOVE MENTIONED JOURNALS THE LENGTH OF THE APPARENTLY OPTIONAL JOURNIES IN EACH IT APPEARS THAT THE HEAVY CARAVANS WENT 7 H 51 M ON A MEAN OF 24 SUCH DAYS AND THE LIGHT CARAVANS 9 H 8 M ON A MEAN OF 38 DAYS IN BOTH OF WHICH CASES AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED THE LENGTH OF THE MEAN OPTIONAL DAY IS SOMEWHAT LONGER THAN THAT OF THE WHOLE JOURNEY IN WHICH THERE IS A WIDER FIELD FOR DELAYS AND ACCIDENTS THE COMPA RISON IS AS FOLLOWS HEAVY CARAVAN LIGHT CARAVAN DISTANCE IN BRITISH DISTANCE IN BRITISH MILES

CAMELS 143 THUS THE MEAN DAILY RATE OF THE HEAVY CARAVAN APPEARS TO BE 1864 BRITISH MILES RECKONING TWO MILES AND AN HALF FOR EACH HOUR AND 1906 IF TAKEN AT 256 AND THE MEAN RATE OF THE LIGHT CARAVAN 2217 MILES AT 212 227 AT 256 IN ORDER TO APPLY THIS SCALE WITH EFFECT TO THE AFRICAN GEO GRAPHY IT IS NECESSARY TO STATE THE NUMBER OF DAYS THAT THE CARAVANS USUALLY HALT ON THE ROAD FOR AS YET I HAVE ONLY CONSI DERED THEIR RATE OF MOTION BUT IT IS EVIDENT THAT IF THE LENGTH OF THE JOURNEY IN THE GROSS IS GIVEN THE REQUISITE INFORMATION WILL NOT BE OBTAINED WITHOUT A PREVIOUS KNOWLEDGE OF THE TIME LOST BY NECESSARY OR UNAVOIDABLE HALTS ON THE ROAD MY ENQUIRIES HAVE FURNISHED ME WITH AN ACCOUNT OF 13 HALTS TO 149 DAYS OF TRAVELLING OR WHICH IS THE SAME THING 13 HALTS OUT OF 162 DAYS RECKONED FROM THE TIME OF DEPARTURE TO THE TIME OF THE ARRIVAL OF THE CARAVANS AT THE PLACE OF DESTINATION THAT IS 1 HALT TO 1212 TRAVELLING DAYS THIS OF COURSE MUST BE DE DUCTED FROM THE AGGREGATE OF THE DISTANCE OR SHOULD IT BE AVERAGED ON EACH DAY THE HEAVY CARAVAN DAY MUST BE RECKONED AT 1714 MILES INSTEAD OF 1864 AND THAT OF THE LIGHT CARAVAN 204 INSTEAD OF 2217 WHEN THE HOURLY RATE IS TAKEN AT TWO MILES AND AN HALF IT ALSO REMAINS TO BE STATED FROM THE PROPORTION THAT THE ROAD DISTANCE BORE TO THE DIRECT DISTANCE BY THE TRACE OF MR CARMICHAELS ROUTE WHAT LENGTH IN DIRECT DISTANCE AND IN GEOGRAPHIC MILES MAY BE ALLOWED FOR EACH DAY FOR THE HEAVY CARAVAN ON SIMILAR LENGTHS OF JOURNEY AND OVER SIMILAR TRACTS OF COUNTRY IT APPEARS THEN THAT ON THE 28 DAYS BE TWEEN ALEPPO AND RACKAMA OPPOSITE MESJID ALI THE MEAN LENGTH OF THE DAYS JOURNEY IN DIRECT DISTANCE IS ABOUT 1514 GEOGRAPHIC MILES AND ON THE WHOLE 45 DAYS BETWEEN ALEPPO AND BUSSORAH 138 SUCH MILES BUT THIS IS WITHOUT ANY ALLOW 1 ANCE144 MR RENNELL ON THE RATE OF ANCE FOR HALTS WHICH AS HAS BEEN OBSERVED BEFORE REQUIRE A DEDUCTION OF 8 PARTS IN 100 TO BE MADE FROM THE GROSS AMOUNT OF THE WHOLE JOURNEY WHEN APPLIED TO THE PURPOSES OF GEO GRAPHY I HAVE ALREADY TAKEN NOTICE THAT MR CARMICHAEL COUNTED THE CAMELS STEPS IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN A SCALE OF DISTANCE AND I SHALL NOW GIVE THE RESULT OF HIS OBSERVATIONS AS WELL AS OF MR HOLFORDS WHO ALSO COUNTED THE STEPS AND MEASURED THE LENGTH OF A NUMBER OF THEM ON THE GROUND MR HUNTERS EXPERIMENT WAS ON TOO SMALL A SCALE TO GROUND A CALCULATION ON IT IS CERTAIN THAT THESE REPORTS OF THE NUMBER OF STEPS DURING CERTAIN PORTIONS OF TIME AND THE MEASUREMENT OF A CERTAIN NUM BER OF THOSE STEPS ON THE GROUND FURNISH A RESULT THAT DOES NOT AGREE WITH THE EXPERIMENTS ON THE GREAT SCALE SUCH AS WE HAVE JUST RELATED AND WHICH APPEAR TO BE SUSCEPTIBLE OF GREATER ACCU RACY THAN THOSE MADE IN DETAIL BUT IT WILL NEVERTHELESS BE PROPER TO GIVE THE RESULTS AND TO MAKE SOME REMARKS ON THEM IF BE ONLY TO PREVENT ANY PERSON IN FUTURE FROM FOUND ING A CALCULATION ON THEM MR CARMICHAEL COUNTED THE DOUBLE STEPS OR RATHER THE RETURN OF THE SAME FOOT OF A CAMEL ON WHICH HE RODE FOR AN HOUR TOGETHER ON 20 DIFFERENT DAYS AT TIMES WHEN FROM THE NATURE OF THE GROUND HE THOUGHT THE GREATEST VARIATION TOOK PLACE IN THE RATE OF MOTION HE FOUND THE GREATEST NUMBER OF STEPS TO BE 2420 THE LEAST 2086 AND THE MEAN OF THE WHOLE 20 HOURS WAS 2200 MR HOLFORD RECKONED THE GREATEST 2240 LEAST 2060 MEAN 2150 THEY BOTH REPORT THE DOUBLE STEP TO BE 5 FEET AND AN HALF THE RESULT OF THE FORMER ACCOUNT IS 229 BRITISH MILES PER HOUR OF THE LATTER 224 AND EACH ALLOWED HIS DISTANCE ACCORDINGLY IN HIS JOURNAL THOUGH NOTHING IS MORE CERTAIN THAN THAT THEIR COMPUTED DISTANCES FALL VERY

MR CARMICHAEL FOR INSTANCE RECKONS THE DISTANCE FROM ALEPPO TO BUSSORAH BY THE ROAD AT 720 BRITISH MILES ALTHOUGH THE DIRECT DISTANCE ITSELF SCARCELY FALLS SHORT OF IT AND MR HOLFORDS ROAD DISTANCE ALSO FALLS VERY SHORT EVEN MR CARMICHAELS HIGHEST NUMBER OF PACES WOULD EXCEED THE MEAN RATE GIVEN BY THE EXPERIMENT AT LARGE BY A SIXTIETH PART ONLY AS THESE GENTLEMENS EXPERIMENTS DIFFER ONLY 50 STEPS IN THE MEAN NUMBER DURING THE HOUR ONE BEING 2200 THE OTHER 2150 THAT IS A 44TH PART THE ERROR MUST BE LOOKED FOR ELSEWHERE AND IT PROBABLY ORIGINATED IN THEIR MEASURING TOO SMALL A NUMBER OF STEPS ON THE GROUND TO FOUND THEIR CAL CULATION ON THE REASON OF THIS GREAT VARIATION IN THE NUMBER OF PACES IN A GIVEN TIME IS THE PLENTY OR SCARCITY OF THE DESERT SHRUBS ON WHICH THE CAMELS FEED AS THEY GO ON AND THUS SUCH EXPE MENTS BECOME ALMOST USELESS UNLESS THE QUALITY OF THE DESERT WAS DESCRIBED IN EVERY PART AS THE HOURLY RATE OF MR CAR MICHAEL COINCIDES WITH THAT OF MR IRWIN WITHIN A VERY SMALL FRACTION ALTHOUGH THE ONE TRAVELLED IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER THE OTHER IN MARCH AND APRIL IT APPEARS THAT THE SEASONS HAVE LITTLE OR NO EFFECT IN THIS PARTICULAR AND IT IS THEREFORE HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT THE SHRUBS MAY FLOURISH IN SOME PARTS OF THE DESERT AND BE DRIED UP IN OTHERS AT ONE AND THE SAME SEASON VOL LXXXI X

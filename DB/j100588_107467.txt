changes the blood undergoes in the act of coagulation By Sir Everard Home Bart VPRS Read November 2a 1817 IT is not a little remarkable that in the first Lecture of this kind which I laid b6fore the Society in the year gi790 I should have endeavoured to show that a muscular fibre was too minute an object to be seen by the humani eye even assisted by the best magnifying glasses then in use and that in thlis Lecture I shall be able by means of the great improve ments that have been made in the use of the microscope to show that a fibre not larger in diameter than one of the glo bules of the blood can be demonstrated To the Members of this Society who have so lately seen Mr BAUERs drawings of the glandular apparatus peculiar to the Java swallow of the internal membrane of the human stomach exposing structures that were not knownl to exist also of so small an object as the human ovum in which is seen the seat of the two most important organs of the body drawings rendered beautiful by their simplicity and dis tinctness  it will readily suggest itself that Mr BAUIER is the person to whom I consider we are indebted for those im provements His whole life I may say has been employed in investigations of a similar nature in plants observing first the natural appearances and then magnifying them in differentSir EVERARD HOME on the changes c degrees and comparing with the nicest discrimination what was exhibited by one magnifying power with what was shown by that immediately above it and where they did not exactly correspond employing the whole energies of his mind with a patient labour almost beyond what is natural in ascertaining the cause of the deception which must in one of them have taken place To the observations of such a man upon subjects of this nature if we are not confidently to place a reliance how are we to give credit to the remarks that are made by common observers I have said thus much as an introduction to the observations that I lam going to bring forward for the public to know whatever opinion they may form of them they have been the result of long and unwearied research  and have been so fre quently repeated as to satisfy Mr BAUER of their correctness The red globules of the blood in the human body when enveloped in their colouring matter appear when measured in the microscope by the micronmeter to be T 70 part of an inch in diameter requiring 289oooo to a superficial or square inch These globuleswhen deprived oftheir colouring matter appear to be  part of an inch in diameter which makes 4ooooo of globules to a square inch From these observations it ap pears that the globules when deprived of the colourirng mat ter are not quite one fifth part smaller The colouring substance appears not to be contained in the globules but only to envelope them one reason for forming this opinion is that the separation is very rapidly effected the colouring substance flowing from all parts of the globule at the same instant and that to retain the globules in the coloured state it is necessary that a very small quantity of blood only be 173Sir EVERARD HOME on the changes the blood smeared as thin as possible upon the glass in order that all moisture may instantly evaporate they then remain of their full size and colour perfectly spherical as in the representa tion fig i P1 viii But if a greater quantity of blood be laid upon a glass which retains moisture only half a minute the co louring matter begins in a few seconds to separate and form a circle round the globule and if the blood is diluted with water the separation of the colouring matter is instantaneous and the globule puts on the appearance represented in fig 2 P1 viii Another reason is the great quantity of colouring mat ter it being as three to one in proportion to the globules The globules of the blood have neither the same size nor the same shape in all animals Dr YOUNG in his introduction to Medical Literature has described them to be of an oval form in the skate Upon examining them in that fish Mr BAUER found them while the fish was alive of the form of an egg but almost immediately after death flattened I shall how ever reserve the materials I have collected upon this subject for another communication When the globules in the human blood lose the colouring matter they continue floating in the serum and are seen to have an attraction towards one another so as to coalesce uniting themselves together In the an nexed drawing is represented their mode of union under differ ent circumstances surrounded by serum deeply tinged with the colouring matter In one instance three globules are so onited as to form one line in another there is a line compo sed of four globules with lateral indentations where the union between the globuIes had taken place This appear ance joined to other circumstances renders it probable at least that the globules may be the part of the blood out of which 174undergoes in the act of coagulation the muscular fibres are principally formed and no fibre they could form would be of smaller dimensions than the globules of which it is composed Having expressed this opinion to Mr BAUER I was desirous that he should try to unravel a muscle so as to come at the ultimate fibre Several attempts of this kind were unsuccessfully made but in one instance in the muscles of the thigh of a roasted chicken a detached fibre was exposed in the microscope which occupied upon the micrometer the same space in every respect with the four globules which I have mentioned to have seen united and floating in the se rum of the blood before the blood had completely coagulated  the muscular fibre from the chicken could be traced to a greater length but the indentations could not be distinguished farther on In prosecuting this examination of the muscular fibres Mr BAUER found that after being boiled or roasted and then macerated in water changing the water every day for a week they were much more readily separated from each other and that he had no difficulty in procuring single fibres similar to the one described from the coats of the human stomach  the thigh of the sheep and of the rabbit and from the salmon The appearances that different fibres put on are represented in the annexed figures 4 5 6 of Plate viii When the fibres are macerated for a longer time they are readily broken down into a mass of globules of the size of those in the blood deprived of their colour The accuracy of the ap pearances that have been described may be depended on how far they will afford the slightest grounds for an opinion that the globules are the materials and the attraction between them the means by which the single fibres are formed and all the 175Sir EVERARD HOME on the changes the blood combinations produced that are met with in the structure of muscles must require farther investigation It is deserving of remark that while the globules are enveloped in their colouring matter they are not seen to run together and coalesce with one another on the field of the microscope it is therefore probable that the attraction by which this effect is produced only takes place between globules deprived of their colour It may not be amiss to enquire how far there is any thing in the formation of fibres in other parts of the body at all in favour of muscular fibres being composed of globules and I shall mention that Mr BAUER in his examination of the substance of the brain under the microscope finds that when that organ is immediately after death made the subject of examination abundance of fibres are met with in every part of it indeed it appears that the whole mass is a tissue of fibres which seems to consist entirely of an accumulation of globules whose union is of so exceedingly delicate a nature that the slightest touch even the mere suction in water deranges and reduces them to that mass of globules of which the brain appears to be composed when examined with less accuracy or under less favourable circumstances He admits that in his first observations he was induced to believe that no such things as fibres were to be met with in the brain but that the whole organ consisted of a mass of these globules He found that the globules of the brain as well as those of pus are exactly the same size as those of the blood when deprived of their colouring matter Mr BAUER not having completed the investigation of the brain in which he is engaged I shall not farther anticipate 176undergoes in te act of coagulation his observations upon this most important organ as my only object in what I have already stated is to mention that the fibres of which it appears to be made up are composed of globules Upon mentioning Mr BAUERS observations on the brain to some of my friends I was referred to the Supplements to the 4th and 5th editions of the Encyclopaedia Britannica in which the opinion of the brain being composed of globules is noticed I find upon making such reference that there is not enough stated respecting the anatomy of the more minute parts of that organ to supersede a farther investigation of its structure as will appear from the following extracts It the brain has been subjected to very minute micro scopical observations by PROCHASKA When he took a small portion of it either from the brain proper or the cerebellum and spread it on a thin plate of glass so that it became pellu cid and then examined it with a powerful microscope he found that it resembled a sort of pulp consisting of innume rable globules or particles of a roundish form A little water added to this pulp divided it into a number of flocculi but he observed that each flocculus was still composed of a number of globules He very rarely found one globule by itself or event two floating in water apart from the rest Maceration in water even for three months was insufficient to separate them from each other He concluded therefore that they were united by means of a very delicate and pellucid cellular substance The globules he observed were not all of the Vol i part z page s6o No64 and No 65 t Oper Min Pars I p 3424 MDCCCXVIII A a 177Sir EVERARD HOME on the changes the blood same size but varied a little in dimension even in the same part of the brain In general however he found them both in the brain proper and in the cerebellum to be more than eight times smaller than a globule of the blood The most powerful microscopes did not enable him to discover any thing satisfactory respecting their structure  These observations have within these few years been prosecuted on a much more extensive scale by JOSEPH and CHARLES WENZEL They have uniformly found that the white nervous matter seemed as if entirely composed of ex tremely small globules or corpuscules of a roundish form putting on the appearance of little cells filled with a proper medullary substance No estimate is given of the dimensions of the globules but they describe them as being exceedingly minute and as being all pretty nearly of the same size They seemed to adhere very closely to each other without any apparent connecting medium The globular appearance continued distinctly perceptible in portions of the substance which had been long exposed to the action of rectified spirit of wine and muriatic acid nor was it even destroyed by steeping the matter in alcohol and then drying it The statements contained in both of these extracts confirm in the most satisfactory manner Mr BAUERS observations although in many respects they are deficient in point of ac curacy Having laid before the Society all I have to offer respecting the appearances of the globules of the blood from which the colouring matter had been discharged I shall endeavour to explain in what manner blood in the act of coagulation  De Penitior Struct Cereb p 24 178undergoes in the act of coagulation acquires that texture which fits it when extravasated in living animals to open a communication with the general circulation and by that means become a part of the solids of the animal It has ever been a desideratum to ascertain in what manner blood after it had coagulated and remained at rest in different parts of a living animalis rendered vascular The fact itself has long been known to every enquirer intothe operations of the animal economy and several theories have been formed to ex plain it Mr HUNTER who perhaps understood the appearances such coagula put on when injected from the neighbouring vessels better than any other physiologist was unable to trace a direct continuation of ramifying branches from the circumference of the living parts to the centre of the coagu lum and therefore referred it to a principle of life existing in the blood which principle was consequently inherent in the coagulum and formed a series of vessels pervading every part of it which opened for themselves communications with the surrounding vessels Since Mr HUNTERS time no more satisfactory opinion has been advanced for the explanation of this curious phenomenon I confess that my own attention has not for the last twenty years been called to this enquiry although before that time while I was assisting Mr HUNTER in the prosecution of his pursuits I gave considerable atten tion to it but remained unsatisfied with all the explanations that had been given My attention was however again called to this subject last summer by different conversations I had with Mr BAUER in which he told me that to illustrate the germination and vegeta 179Sir EVERARD HOME on the changes the blood tion of wheat introductory to his illustrations of the diseases in corn he sowed a quantity of wheat and afterwards took up every day some grains or plants for examination till the ears were ripe In his close attention to the changes that took place he was very much struck with the rapid increase of the tubular hair of the root of a young plant of wheat in its earliest stage of vegetation and fixing his whole attention upon that part of the plant he observed small pustules of a slimy substance arising under the epidermis on the surface of the young root and in a few seconds a small bubble of gas burst from the root into the slimy matter which it extended in a moment to the length the hair was to acquire and the slimy matter surrounding the gas immediately coagu lated and formed a canal He repeated his observations on another plant whose pubescence consisted of a jointed hair and observed the same effect take place a bubble issued from the young stalk and extended the slimy mucus to a short distance forming the first joint which immediately coagulated and became transparent and at its extremity a new pustule of the same slimy mucus accumulated into which in a short time the gas from the first joint rushed and thus in a moment a second joint was formed in the same manner he observed the formation of the hairs of ten or twelve joints to take place These observations so curious in themselves and which explain in so simple and satisfactory a manner one of the modes in which tubes are formed in vegetables and an addi tion is made to the plant made so strong an impression on my mind and so entirely engrossed my attention that I did i8oundergoes in the act of coagulation not allow Mr BAUER to rest till he gave me his assistance in instituting experiments to ascertain whether any thing simi lar takes place in animal bodies The first object of our enquiry was to know whether any gas is to be found in the blood while circulating in the vessels and under what circumstances it is separated from it That the blood whilst circulating in the arteries and veins holds a considerable quantity of gas in solution is proved by the fol lowing experiments made at rny request by Professor BRANDE Blood was drawn from a vein in the arm and whilst yet warm was placed under the receiver of an air pump during the exhaustion of the receiver there was a considera ble escape of gas from the blood so that it had the appearance of effervescing and soon depressed the quicksilver in the gage of the pump He afterwards ascertained that this gas is carbonic acid gas is met with in the same proportions in arterial and venal blood and two cubic inches were extricated from every ounce of blood That a considerable portion of this carbonic acid gas is extricated from the blood during the spontaneous coagulation of that fluid was previously proved by Mr BAUER who filled glass tubes with blood recently drawn and tying them over with bladder inverted them At first there was no appear ance of gas upon the surface but as the blood coagulated it was separated and in the course of 24 hours was found in considerable quantity Having ascertained notonly the existence of gas in the blood but that it is separated during the process of coagulation I was most anxious to discover whether as in vegetables the gas  See Annales de Chimie Tom XIIIX 8tSir EVERARD HoME on the chaiges the blood thus let loose pervaded the surrounding fluid into whicll it is propelled in any particular manner With a view to determine this point I wounded the skin of my arm with the point of a lancet so as to draw a drop of blood which was received into a watch glass in a fluid state and placed in the field of the microscope The eye was then kept constantly fixed upon it to watch the changes that might take place The first thing that happened was the formation of a film upon the surface that part beginning to coagulate soonertai that the rest In about five minutes something was seen to be disengaged in different parts of the coagulllun beginning to show itself where the greatest number of globules were collected and from thence passing in every direction with considerable rapidity through the serum but not at all interfering with the globules themselves which had all dis charged their colouring matter wherever this extricated matter was carried a network immediately formed anasto mosing with itself on every side through every part of the coagulum When the parts became dry the appearance of a network remained unaltered In some instances bubbles were seen to burst through the upper surface of the coagu lum this however did not prevent the ramifications that have been described from taking place The annexed Plates give the exact representation of the appearance the blood taken from my arm put on when it coagulated and became dry as shown in the field of the microscope PI ix x If the blood is cold when it is exposed in the microscope and there is a larger quantity of serum upon the glass the net work is only formed in those parts where clusters of globules are collected and when the serum dries it cracks and spoils 182undergoes in the act of coagulation the appearance This happens sometimes several days after the formation of the network has taken place When clear serum without any globules is put upon the glass nothing is extricated but when the serum is quite dry it cracks and the cracks may be mistaken for the network  but by comparing them with it the difference is found to be obvious These facts which Mr BAUER has enabled me to bring forward appear to point out an important change the blood undergoes after it is extravasated When this happens in living animal bodies from whatever cause and in whatever circumstances it takes place no difficulty remains in account ing for its afterwards becoming vascular since all that is necessary for that purpose is the red blood being received into the channels of which this network is formed I shall not detain the Society with any farther observations in support of what I have advanced satisfied that if the facts do not bear themselves out it will be superfluous to load them with theoretical opinions I cannot conclude this Lecture without paying a tribute to the President of the Society not a tribute of praise but a tri bute of justice for whenever general science or any of its branches are brought under his consideration the zeal and exertion which he shows upon all occasions to promote the pursuits of individuals exceeds whatever has been done by others in this or any other country and is above all praise Whatever Mr BAUER has already done and whatever he may hereafter bring to light respecting the more minute parts of animal bodies is entirely to be attributed to the Pre sident for it is at his particular request under his encou ragement and in compliance with his wishes that MrSir EVERARD HoM n the cnges c BAUmR has put a restraint upon himself and for a time laid aside the prosecution of the Anatmy of Vegetables which from his early youth has been his favourite occupation to assist in bringing to light appearances in the anatomy of animals which without his aid must still have remained in obscurity

silver lead copper and zinc Important mines in Colorado and Utah found it difficult to make profits on lowgrade ores and large smelters in these states were closed during part of the year or were operated with reduced capacities A temporary lack of demand for silver in India and a very heavy production in Canada contributed to the de pression in price The average price per ounce during the year was 53 cents as against 66 cents in 1907 The Geological Surveys re port on gold and silver in 1908 prepared by Messrs Waldemar Lindgren and H D Mc Caskey may be had by applying to the direc tor of the survey at Washington ACCORDING to a notice in the London Times the project described recently by Sir William Willcocks at a meeting of the Royal Geo graphical Society promises to be the most im portant engineering undertaking of the near future An irrigation scheme is being planned for the rehabilitation of Mesopotamia upon such a scale that 3000000 acres of the best land in that country will be provided with water If it is carried out the Tigris the Euphrates and the Akkar Kuf Lake will form part of a controlled system of canals weirs and barrages whereby the pernicious silt is to be separated floods are to be prevented and wheatbearing land is to be nourished with water It is estimated that the cultivated area will be doubled and that the crop of wheat along the Euphrates will be trebbled The scheme would also result in a vast in crease in the yield of cotton Briefly it con sists of providing a means of escape for the flood waters of the Euphrates along the de pressions of the Pison but it also entails the construction of a great central canal regu lators to control the supply from the Euphrates at the head of the Sakhlawia a weir on the Tigris a canal for irrigation to the north of Baghdad another canal along the right bank of the Tigris and the building of a railway along the left bank of this canal for the trans port of the harvests Moreover the construc tion work would include a railway to connect NCE 917 Baghdad with the Mediterranean by a short and cheap route UNIVERSITY AND EDUCATIONAL NEWS THE trustees of the University of Pennsyl vania announce that Mr Henry Phipps of New York founder of the Phipps Institute in Philadelphia has presented to the univer sity 500000 to be used in the campaign against tuberculosis The management of the Phipps Institute will be in the hands of the university and the study treatment and pre vention of the disease will be continued in a new hospital to be erected at Seventh and Lombard Streets Six years ago Henry Phipps founded the Phipps Institute for Tuberculosis Research in Philadelphia with a large endowment In 1908 he gave 500 000 to the Johns Hopkins University for the founding of a psychiatric clinic THE eleventh industrial fellowship at the University of Kansas has been established by the Pacific Coast Borax Company of Oakland California and will be known as the Borax fellowship The amount which this company will pay to support the work of its fellow is 750 The purpose of the fellowship is to in vestigate the uses of borax and to discover if possible new commercial utility in this prod uct THE cornerstone of the new science hall of Howard University was recently laid by Rich ard A Ballinger secretary of the interior Addresses were delivered by Dr Robert S Woodward president of the Carnegie Institu tion of Washington and Dr Charles Wardell Stiles director of the Rockefeller fund for combating the hookworm disease An ap propriation of 90000 was made by the last congress for the erection of this hall LECTURES in veterinary science are to be given in the College of Agriculture of the University of Wisconsin this year during the second semester as a result of the appointment of Dr John Spencer of Pulaski Va as spe cial lecturer in veterinary science In addi tion to his lectures Dr Spencer will haveN S VOL XXX No 782 veterinary supervision of the university flocks and herds TIE department of mining engineering of the University of Illinois has just issued its first circular of information The course of study required for the degree of BS in min ing engineering covers the usual period of four years The technical studies relating to mining are begun in the sophomore year min ing principles in the first semester and earth and rock excavation in the second semester In the junior year the study of mining meth ods mine surveying and mine ventilation is pursued In the senior year more time is de voted to the subjects relating particularly to mining They are mechanical engineering of collieries mine administration and organiza tion mining law mining laboratory and eco nomics of coal Professor H H Stock head of the department has been appointed a mem ber of the Mine Commission by Governor Deneen A Mine Explosion and Rescue Sta tion has been established at the university under the direction of Mr R Y Williams IT has been decided by Balliol College to offer next year an exhibition of 80 a year tenable for two years for the competition among students recommended by trade unions operating in Newcastle FOR the recently constituted degree of bach elor of science in agriculture at the Univer sity of Manchester special courses have been prepared The practical work will be carried on at the college of agriculture and horticul ture at Holmes Chapel under the supervision of the principal Mr T J Young who has been appointed a lecturer in the department of agriculture in the university THE professorship of natural history at the College of the City of New York has been filled by the promotion of Dr Ivin Sickels as sistant professor who since the death of Pro fessor Stratford has directed the affairs of the department Professor CE A Winslow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has accepted an appointment as associate pro fessor of biology in the College of the City of New York and has been made curator of pub lic health in the American Museum of Nat ural History Professor Winslow is lecturing at the University of Chicago on leave of ab sence from the institute during January Feb ruary and March returns to Technology for the rest of the spring term and goes to New York in September DR JOSEPI EVANS of Philadelphia has been appointed professor of clinical medicine and medical adviser to the students of the University of Wisconsin MR HAROLD K BARROWS Of the U S Geo logical Survey has been appointed to the position of associate professor of hydraulic engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology made vacant by the resignation of Professor William E Mott DISCUSSION AND CORRESPONDENCE THE TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY DYNAMICS IN THE HIGH SCHOOL To THE EDITOR OF SCIENCE So the teachers of physics have at last recognized and con fessed the fact that they do not know how to teach elementary dynamics or kinetics to high school students and they think they have discovered the cause of their trouble viz the multiplicity of forms in which the  young ster  is taught the familiar formula force  mass X acceleration one of these forms being force poundals mass pounds X accel ft per sec per sec1 Instead of drawing the obvious conclusion let us simplify the subject and get rid of some of the forms especially the one with the poundal in it the physicists are actually talking of running away from the difficulty A majority of a conference of physicists have signed a statement which proposes among other things that colleges should require of the schools no quantitative treatment of ki netics or the behavior of matter undergoing acceleration To this lame and impotent conclusion have the teachers of physics come after years of blindly following the modern textbooks The aim of these textbooks seems to be not to make 1 See Professor Edwin Halls paper in SCIENCE October 29 918 SCIENCE

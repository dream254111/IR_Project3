J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1010330,MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT,I242539,NOTES I MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT AM4ERICAN CITIES BROOKLYNAMALGAMATION THE EXPERIENCE OF BROOKLYN WITH AMALGAMATION HAS IN THE MAIN BEEN SATISFACTORY THE COMMUNITY INSISTED ON UNIFORMITY OF ASSESSMENTS AND TAXATION THROUGHOUT THE CON SOLIDATED CITY BEFORE IT WOULD CONSENT TO SURRENDER ITS AUTONOMY A PROVISION WAS ACCORDINGLY PUT IN THE CHARTER OF THE ENLARGED CITY REQUIR ING THAT THERE SHOULD BE A UNIFORM RATE OF TAXATION THROUGHOUT THE NEW MUNICIPALITY THE TAX LAWS ALREADY PROVIDED THAT ALL ASSESSMENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE SHOULD BE MADE ON A UNIFORM BASIS BUT THE CHARTER GAVE TO THE PEOPLE HERE A REMEDY FOR UNEQUAL ASSESSMENTS IN THAT IT PERMITTED THEM TO SEEK A REVIEW OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASSES SORS IN THE COURTS LOWER TAX BILLS WERE PROMISED TO DWELLERS IN BROOKLYN AND THE BILLS HAVE BEEN LOWER THERE WHILE IN MANHATTAN AND THE BRONX OR IN THE OLD CITY OF NEW YORK THEY HAVE BEEN HIGHER THE EQUALIZATION OF ASSESSMENTS INVOLVED A RAISING OF MANHATTAN VALUATIONS AND THE LEVYING OF THE TAX UNIFORMLY ON THE WHOLE CITY DISTRIBUTED THE BURDEN OF TAXATION MORE EQUITABLY THAN HAD BEEN POSSIBLE WHEN THE OLD CITY OF NEW YORK PROFITED EXCLUSIVELY BY THE TAXES ON THE GREAT WEALTH CONCENTRATED ON MANHATTAN ISLAND IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE COST OF GOVERNMENT IN THE CONSOLIDATED CITY IS LARGER THAN THE TOTAL COST OF GOVERNMENT IN THE INDEPENDENT MUNICIPALITIES COMPOSING IT BROOKLYN HAS TO PAY LESS FOR GOVERNMENT THAN WHEN SHE WAS INDEPENDENT BUT ASIDE FROM TAXATION THE EXPERIMENT OF CONSOLIDATION HAS NOT BEEN IMMEDIATELY SUCCESSFUL FOR BROOKLYN WHAT IT WILL BE IN THE FUTURE IT IS USELESS TO PROPHESY THE LOCAL INTERESTS OF THE BOROUGH HAVE SUFFERED NO PLANS FOR NEW SCHOOL HOUSES HAVE BEEN MADE AND FEW IF ANY SITES FOR NEW BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN BOUGHT SOME SCHOOL BUILDINGS THAT WERE PLANNED OR BEGUN BEFORE CONSOLIDATION HAVE BEEN COMPLETED BUT THE NEW OFFICIALS HAVE EITHER NOT PLANNED ANY NEW WORK OR HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED IN GETTING MONEY APPROPRIATED FOR DOING THAT WHICH THEY HAVE PLANNED THE SAME CONDITIONS PREVAIL IN THE STREET DEPARTMENT IN THE DEPARTMENT OF SEWERS AND IN THE WATER DEPARTMENT PRACTICALLY ALL IMPROVEMENTS HAVE BEEN AT A STANDSTILL THIS SITUATION HAS BEEN PRODUCED PARTLY BY THE PRACTICAL AND UNAVOID ABLE DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY OF FITTING THE NEW GOVERNMENT TO THE I CONTRIBUTED BY F H GUNNISON ESQ 139140 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY ENLARGED CITY AND PARTLY BY THE COMPLICATED MACHINERY PROVIDED FOR THE DOING OF BUSINESS THE CHARTER METHODS ARE SO CUMBERSOME THAT IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING AND EMERGENCY WORK HAS HAD TO BE ABANDONED ALMOST ENTIRELY FOR IT IS SO LONG BEFORE IT CAN BE DONE THAT BY THE TIME THE PROPER AUTHORITY TO DO IT HAS BEEN SECURED THE EMERGENCY HAS PASSED EVERYONE ADMITS THAT SOME CHANGE SHOULD BE MADE IN THE CHARTER LOOKING TO THE REMOVAL OF THESE DEFECTS THERE ARE TWO PARTIES OF CHARTER REVISIONISTS ONE PARTY HOLDING THAT REFORM CAN BE SECURED BEST BY THE CONCENTRATION OF POWER IN THE HEADS OF THE VARIOUS DEPART MENTS OF THE CITY GOVERNMENT AND IN THE PRACTICAL DESTRUCTION OF WHAT INDEPENDENCE THE BOROUGHS NOW HAVE THE OTHER PARTY DEMANDS DECENTRALIZATION AND AN INCREASE IN THE AUTONOMY OF THE BOROUGHS INDEED THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO ADVOCATE THAT THE BOROUGHS SHOULD RAISE WITHIN THEIR OWN BOUNDARIES THE MONEY WHICH IS SPENT THERE AND SPEND IT TO SUIT THEMSELVES THIS MEANS OF COURSE THE PRACTICAL REPEAL OF CONSOLIDATION IT IS NOT KNOWN JUST WHAT WILL BE DONE BUT A COMMISSION APPOINTED BY GOVERNOR ROOSEVELT TO CONSIDER THE SUB JECT IS AT WORK ON A REVISION OF THE CHARTER IT WILL MAKE ITS REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE WHICH MEETS IN JANUARY IT IS NOT PROBABLE THAT THE REPORT WILL BE PUBLISHED UNTIL THE LEGISLATURE SEES IT THE FATE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMISSION WHATEVER THEY MAY BE WILL DEPEND LARGELY UPON THE EXIGENCIES OF POLITICS WHICH CANNOT BE FORE SEEN AT THIS TIME ST LOUISAMALGAMATIONL THE CITY OF ST LOUIS WITH A NEED OF AT LEAST TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS FINDS ITSELF FACING A DEFICIT ESTIMATED AT A MILLION DOLLARS THE MUNICIPALITY HAS ALREADY CONTRACTED A BONDED DEBT UP TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL LIMIT AND HAS LEVIED THE MAXIMUM REVENUE RATE WHICH IS DOUBLE WHAT IT IS IN THE STATE AT LARGE NO APPARENT SOURCE OF IMMEDIATE RELIEF IS THEREFORE OPEN TO IT THIS GRAVE CONDITION OF AFFAIRS MAY BE SAID TO BE LARGELY DUE TO INJU DICIOUS AMALGAMATION THE PRESENT SCHEME AND CHARTER ADOPTED IN I876 WAS PLANNED APPARENTLY IN CONTEMPLATION OF A COMPACT POPULA TION SUCH IS THE INFERENCE THAT MUST BE DRAWN FROM THE LIMITS WHICH WERE PLACED UPON THE RATE OF TAXATION AND UPON THE ABILITY OF THE CITY TO CONTRACT INDEBTEDNESS AT THE SAME TIME HOWEVER THE LIMITS OF THE CITY WERE EXTENDED SO AS TO INCLUDE PRACTICALLY THE WHOLE OF THE SUB URBAN POPULATION ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE MISSISSIPPI WHILE THE COUNTY ORGANIZATION WITHIN THE TERRITORIAL LIMITS OF THE CITY WAS ABOLISHED AND THE BURDEN OF MAINTAINING WHAT ARE PROPERLY COUNTY INSTITUTIONS WAS THROWN UPON THE MUNICIPALITY WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF LEVYING A CORRESPONDING COUNTY TAX  CONTRIBUTED BY PROFESSOR R F HOXIE ST LOUISMUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT WHILE THE OUTLYING URBAN UNITS WERE UNIMPORTANT IN SIZE AND WEALTH THE GRAVE POSSIBILITIES OF THIS WHOLESALE AMALGAMATION WITHOUT ADE QUATE CHARTER MODIFICATIONS DID NOT AT ONCE DEVELOP SO AS TO ATTRACT SERIOUS ATTENTION OF LATE HOWEVER OWING TO IMPROVEMENTS IN RAPID TRANSIT AND AS A RESULT OF THE CHANGE OF ST LOUIS FROM AN ESSENTIALLY RIVER TOWN TO A RAILROAD CENTRE THE SUBURBS ESPECIALLY TO THE WEST WHICH WERE WIDELY SEPARATED FROM THE OLD CITY HAVE GROWN WITH REMARKABLE RAPIDITY THE RESULTING INCREASED DEMANDS FOR WATER MAINS AND SEW ERS FOR PAVING LIGHTING AND POLICE PROTECTION HAVE BEEN ALTOGETHER OUT OF PROPORTION TO THE INCREASE OF TAXABLE WEALTH THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN TRUE HAD THE GROWTH OF THE OUTLYING DISTRICTS BEEN DUE ALTOGETHER TO ADDITIONS TO THE POPULATION OF THE CITY BUT THE PROPORTION OF EXPENSE TO TAXABLE WEALTH HAS BEEN GREATLY INCREASED BY THE FACT THAT THIS SUBURBAN GROWTH HAS BEEN TO A LARGE EXTENT DUE TO MIGRATION OF WEALTHY RESIDENTS THIS HAS LEFT A MIDDLE ZONE IN WHICH PUBLIC IM PROVEMENTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE AND WHICH REQUIRES ADEQUATE LIGHTING AND POLICE PROTECTION WITH DECREASED TAXABLE VALUE THE REMEDY FOR THE EXISTING STATE OF AFFAIRS SEEMS TO BE IN A REORGANI ZATION OF THE PRESENT CHARTER OR THE ADOPTION OF A NEW CHARTER WHICH SHALL RECOGNIZE THE NEEDS OF A WIDELY SCATTERED MUNICIPAL POPULATION NO INCREASE IN THE TAX RATE WHICH MAY BE LEGALLY LEVIED WILL SUFFICE SINCE A GREAT PART OF THE NEED IS FOR IMMEDIATE IMPROVEMENTS OF A RELATIVELY PERMANENT CHARACTER THE ABILITY TO INCREASE THE BONDED INDEBTEDNESS FOR THESE IMPROVEMENTS SEEMS TO BE A PRIME NECESSITY IN ORDER THAT THE BURDEN MAY FALL TO A GREAT EXTENT ON THOSE WHO WILL BENE FIT FROM THE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE FUTURE THE SITUATION IS CALLING FORTH MUCH DISCUSSION LOCALLY OWING TO THE SPECIAL URGENCY OF CITY NEEDS IN VIEW OF THE PROPOSED WORLDS FAIR IN 1903 CIVIL SERVICE 189919001IN NEW YORK STATE WHERE THE CIVIL SERVICE RULES APPLY TO EACH OF THE FORTYFIVE CITIES MANY IMPROVEMENTS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT THROUGH THE OPERATION OF THE LAW ENACTED APRIL I4 1899 DURING THE PERIOD FROM THAT DATE TO THE FOLLOWING AUTUMN THE NEW YORK CITY RULES WERE AMENDED TO CONFORM TO THE NEW SYSTEM THE AMENDMENTS CONSISTED FOR THE MOST PART IN RE DUCTIONS IN THE NUMBERS OF POSITIONS EXEMPT FROM EXAMINATION AND IN CHANGES DESIGNED TO DO AWAY WITH OPPORTUNITIES FOR EVASIONS THE NEW RULES WERE PROMULGATED BY THE STATE BOARD ACTING AFTER MAYOR VAN WYCKS FAILURE TO ACT ON JULY II 1899 ALTHOUGH A GREAT ADVANCE ON THE RULES THEY SUPERSEDED THEY HAVE SINCE BEEN FURTHER AMENDED IN MANY IMPORTANT RESPECTS AND NOW PRESENT A FAR MORE SUBSTANTIAL BARRIER TO THE USE OF CITY PATRONAGE FOR THE BENEFIT OF TAMMANY HALL THAN TAMMANY HAS EVER HAD TO CONFRONT L CONTRIBUTED BY HON C R WOODRUFF PHILADELPHIA I41142 ANNALS OF THX AMERICAN ACADEMY BEFORE THE CIVIL SERVICE REFORM ASSOCIATION HAS WON A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT SUITS DESIGNED TO TEST DISPUTED POINTS IN THE NEW SYSTEM THE STATE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION WHICH HAS ENLARGED POWERS UNDER THE NEW ACT INCLUDING AN EFFECTIVE SUPERVISION OF THE OPERATION OF THE RULES IN CITIES HAS RECENTLY APPOINTED AN INSPECTOR TO VISIT THE VARIOUS CITIES PERIODICALLY AND REPORT ON EXISTING CONDITIONS THIS OFFICER HAS ALREADY DISCOVERED A BAD STATE OF AFFAIRS IN THE CITY OF SYRACUSE AND A FORMAL INVESTIGATION RESULTING IN THE DISPLACEMENT OF THE LOCAL COMMISSION FOLLOWED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW OF THE SMALL CITIES HOWEVER ALL OTHERS SEEM TO BE OBEYING THE LAW IN A SATIS FACTORY MANNER MASSACHUSETTSSEVERAL BILLS WERE INTRODUCED AT THE LAST SESSION OF THE LEGISLATURE DESIGNED TO WEAKEN THE SYSTEM IN CITIES ESPECIALLY IN BOSTON BUT ALL WERE EITHER DEFEATED OR VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR CHICAGOTHE BACKWARD TENDENCY OF CIVIL SERVICE REFORM IN CHI CAGO HAS BEEN ARRESTED BY THE REORGANIZATION OF THE CITY COMMISSION AND THE APPOINTMENT OF COLONEL JOHN W ELA LATE PRESIDENT OF THE CHICAGO CIVIL SERVICE REFORM LEAGUE AS A MEMBER SINCE COLONEL ELAS INSTALLATION MANY IMPROVEMENTS HAVE BEEN EFFECTED PARTICU LARLY WITH REGARD TO THE SYSTEM OF PROMOTIONS THE SITUATION HAS BEEN MUCH IMPROVED MOREOVER BY A DECISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF COOK COUNTY BY WHICH SEVERAL INJURIOUS RULINGS OF THE OLD COM MISSION WERE SET ASIDE AND

UNDER AUTHORITY GIVEN BY THE NEW CHARTER AND IN THE OTHER UNDER A SPECIAL ACT COMPETENT BOARDS OF EXAMINERS HAVE BEEN APPOINTED FOR EACH THE USEFULNESS OF THE RULES FOR THE POLICE DEPARTMENT IS SOMEWHAT MARRED HOWEVER BY A CONSTRUCTION OF THE CORPORATION COUNSEL BASED ON AN ERROR IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE ACT TO THE EFFECT THAT APPOINTMENTS MAY BE MADE FROM ANY PART OF THE ELIGIBLE LISTS THIS CONSTRUCTION IT IS UNDERSTOOD WILL BE DISPUTED BY THE BALTIMORE REFORM LEAGUE AND THE LOCAL CIVIL SERVICE REFORM ASSOCIATION NEW ORLEANSTHE SYSTEM IN NEW ORLEANS ESTABLISHED BY THE PRESENT CHARTER HAS BEEN VIRTUALLY DESTROYED BY AN ACT PASSED BY THE LAST LEGISLATURE THE CIVIL SERVICE REFORM LEAGUE ORGANIZED DURING THE LEGISLATIVE CAMPAIGN WILL BE CONTINUED UNDER ITS AUSPICES THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE MODIFYING ACT IS BEING TESTED IN THE COURTS SAN FRANCISCOTHE CIVIL SERVICE SYSTEM WAS ESTABLISHED IN SAN FRANCISCO ON JANUARY I I9OO WHEN THE NEW CHARTER WENT INTO OPERATION IT APPLIES PRACTICALLY TO ALL DEPARTMENTS IS MODELED ON THE BEST FEATURES OF THE SYSTEMS IN FORCE IN OTHER CITIES AND IS ADMINISMUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT TERED BY A COMMISSION COMPOSED OF KNOWN FRIENDS OF THE MERIT SYSTEM APPOINTED BY A WELLDISPOSED MAYOR IT MAY BE RECALLED THAT THE ELECTION THROUGH WHICH THE CHARTER WAS ADOPTED BY POPULAR VOTE TURNED PRINCIPALLY ON THE ISSUE OF CIVIL SERVICE REFORM COLUMBUSRULES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR COLUMBUS UNDER AN ACT OF THE OHIO LEGISLATURE REQUIRING THEIR APPLICATION TO THE DEPARTMENTS OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS IN  CITIES OF THE FIRST GRADE OF THE SECOND CLASS AND PERMITTING THEIR EXTEN SION ON AUTHORIZATION OF THE COMMON COUNCIL TO ALL OTHER DEPART MENTS AND OFFICERS OF SUCH CITIES THE COMMISSION APPOINTED FOR COLUMBUS HAS DRAFTED AND PROMULGATED AN EXCELLENT SET OF RULES AND SECURED AUTHORITY FOR THEIR EXTENSION PRACTICALLY TO THE ENTIRE CITY SERVICE CHICAGODRAINAGE CANAL LITIGATION1 AN EVENT OF TREMENDOUS SIGNIFICANCE TO CHICAGO WAS THE OPENING OF ITS GREAT DRAINAGE CANAL ON JANUARY 17 1900 LAKE MICHIGAN IS NOW JOINED TO THE GULF AND THE FLOW OF ITS PURE WATERS PASSING THROUGH THE NEW CANAL AND INTO THE ILLINOIS AND MISSISSIPPI RIVERS RECEIVES AND CARRIES OFF THE IMMENSE MASS OF CHICAGO SEWAGE AS HAD BEEN ANTICIPATED THE OPENING OF THE CANAL GAVE RISE TO LITIGATION WHICH IF NOT OF SERIOUS IMPORT TO THE FUTURE OF THE CANAL IS OF GREAT GENERAL INTEREST THE MOST IMPORTANT CASE IS THAT OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI COMPLAIN ANT VS STATE OF ILLINOIS AND SANITARY DISTRICT OF CHICAGO DEFENDANTS THIS IS AN ORIGINAL PROCEEDING INSTITUTED IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES TO ENJOIN THE DRAINAGE TRUSTEES FROM ALLOWING THE SEW AGE OF CHICAGO TO BE DISCHARGED INTO THE CANAL THE CASE RAISES TWO IMPORTANT QUESTIONS ONE OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND ONE OF SANITA TION THE CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION IS AS TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE SU PREME COURT TO ENTERTAIN THE CASE THE COMPLAINANT ASSERTS ORIGINAL JURISDICTION IN THAT COURT UNDER SECTION 2 ARTICLE 3 OF THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION CREATING SUCH JURISDICTION IN CASES IN WHICH A STATE SHALL BE A PARTY AMENDED SUBSEQUENTLY BY PROVISION THAT SUCH JURIS DICTION SHALL NOT EXTEND  TO ANY SUIT IN LAW OR EQUITY COMMENCED OR PROSECUTED AGAINST ONE OF THE UNITED STATES BY CITIZENS OF ANOTHER STATE OR BY CITIZENS OR SUBJECTS OF ANY FOREIGN STATE IT IS AVERRED IN THE COMPLAINT THAT THE CANAL WAS BUILT BY THE SANI TARY DISTRICT OF CHICAGO AS ONE OF THE  GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS AND UNDER THE DIRECTION AND CONTROL OF THAT STATE THAT THE FLOW OF THE CHANNEL WILL CAUSE DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE INJURY TO THE STATE OF MISSOURI THAT THE 1500 TONS OF FILTH AND SEWAGE CAST DAILY INTO THE CANAL AT CHICAGO WILL POISON AND POLLUTE THE WATERS OF THE MISSISSIPPI AND RENDER THEM UNHEALTHFUL AND UNFIT  FOR DRINKING 1 CONTRIBUTED BY M F GALLAGHER ESQ CHICAGO IL1 I43ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY PURPOSES AND ALL OTHER DOMESTIC AND MANUFACTURING AND AGRICULTURAL PURPOSES AND DESTROY THE VALUE OF WATER WORKS CREATED AT GREAT EXPENSE BY VARIOUS MUNICIPALITIES ALONG THE RIVER DEFENDANTS DENY JURISDICTION IN THE SUPREME COURT BECAUSE THE BILL DOES NOT SET FORTH  WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES ANY CONTROVERSY BETWEEN THE STATE OF MISSOURI AND STATE OF ILLINOIS THE CONTENTION IS THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT EXISTS IS BETWEEN THE STATE OF ILLINOIS AND A PUBLIC CORPORATION CREATED BY IT AND CERTAIN CITIES AND TOWNS OF MISSOURI AND CERTAIN CITIZENS OF THAT STATE RESIDING ON OR NEAR THE BANKS OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER IT IS ARGUED THAT THE STATE OF MISSOURI HAS MERELY LENT ITS NAME TO THE CASE OF THE CITY OF ST LOUIS AND THAT THE SUIT IN NO WISE AFFECTS THE PROP ERTY RIGHTS OF THE STATE ITSELF THE ISSUE THUS RAISED IS OF COURSE OF GREAT LEGAL IMPORT AND WILL REQUIRE A CONSTRUCTION OF THE PERTINENT PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL CON STITUTION THE OTHER QUESTION OF ESPECIAL INTEREST TO STUDENTS OF SANITATION IS LARGELY A PROBLEM IN CHEMISTRY AND BACTERIOLOGY THE DRAINAGE TRUS TEES ASSERT IN THEIR ANSWER TO THE COMPLAINT THAT THE SEWAGE DISCHARGED INTO THE CANAL WILL HAVE ENTIRELY LOST ITS NOXIOUS MATTER BEFORE THE FLOW REACHES THE MISSISSIPPI AND THAT IT WILL IN NO WISE POISON OR POLLUTE THAT STREAM THEY GO A STEP FARTHER AND SAY THAT THE TURNING INTO THE DESPLAINES RIVER OF THE SEWAGE OF THE SANITARY DISTRICT OF CHICAGO TOGETHER WITH THE 300000 CUBIC FEET PER MINUTE OF THE PURE WATER OF LAKE MICHIGAN WHICH WILL ACCOMPANY THE SAME WILL GREATLY IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE WATERS OF THE ILLINOIS AND MISSISSIPPI RIVERS IT IS ALSO INSISTED THAT THE STATE OF MISSOURI IS ESTOPPED FROM COM PLAINING OF THE CANAL BECAUSE WHILE IT WAS IN PROCESS OF CONSTRUCTION FOR OVER ELEVEN YEARS NO OBJECTION WAS RAISED THE SUPREME COURT HAS ORDERED THE CASE FOR ORAL ARGUMENT AT THE OCTOBER TERM BUT NO DATE HAS BEEN SET FOR IT CIVIL SERVICE REFORM NEW RULES ADOPTED BY THE THE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION CLEARLY OUTLINE THE METHOD OF PROMOTING EMPLOYEES WITHIN THE CLASSIFIED SERVICE HENCEFORTH THE HIGHER GRADES OF WORK ARE SO FAR AS POSSIBLE TO BE STRICTLY CONFINED TO EMPLOYEES PROMOTED FROM INFERIOR POSITIONS TO THE END THAT A PERMANENT TRAINED FORCE OF MUNI CIPAL SERVANTS MAY BE DEVELOPED THE RULES PROVIDE THAT PROMOTIONS SHALL BE GOVERNED BY ASCERTAINED MERIT AND SENIORITY OF SERVICE AND MADE AFTER COMPETITIVE EXAMINATIONS WHICH SHALL BE HELD WHENEVER THE NEXT LOWER GRADE OF SERVICE SHALL BE CONSTITUTED OF AT LEAST TWO PER SONS ELIGIBLE TO PROMOTION AND COMPETITION SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE MEMBERS OF SUCH NEXT LOWER RANK OR GRADE IF IN THE IMMEDIATELY INFERIOR DIVISION OF SERVICE THERE ARE NOT TWO 144MUNICIPAL GOVZRNMBNT 145 MEN WANTING TO TAKE THE EXAMINATION FOR PROMOTION THEN THE USUAL ORIGINAL ENTRANCE TEST WILL BE HAD HOWEVER IF AFTER SIXTY DAYS FROM THE GENERAL EXAMINATION A REQUISITION TO FILL A VACANCY IS RECEIVED AND THERE ARE THEN PERSONS IN THE NEXT INFERIOR POSITION COMPETENT TO TAKE THE EXAMINATION FOR PROMOTION SUCH EXAMINATION WILL BE HELD FOR THEIR BENEFIT AND THE EMPLOYEE QUALIFIED FOR THE VACANT POSITION SHALL BE

HIMSELF BECOME RECOG NIZED AS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL AND PROGRESSIVE SUPERINTENDENTS IN THE COUNTRY MR BELLS OPPOSITION TO MR JONES APPARENTLY DID NOT REFLECT THE SENTIMENT OF ANY CONSIDERABLE NUMBER EVEN MR BELL HIM SELF DEEMING IT NECESSARY IN VIEW OF THE STORM OF PROTESTS CALLED FORTH BY THE FEAR THAT IF ELECTED HE WOULD REMOVE MR JONES TO ISSUE A CARD WHICH WHILE SOMEWHAT EQUIVOCAL IN STATEMENT WAS UNDERSTOOD AS IT NIUST HAVE BEEN INTENDED IT SHOULD BE AS A PLEDGE THAT MR JONES WOULD BE RETAINED MR BELL WAS ELECTED AND TOOK OFFICE IN APRIL ON MONDAY JULY 2 THE EARLY EDITIONS OF THE

AND THAT MR JONES HAD CEASED TO BE SUPERINTENDENT AT THE MOMENT OF RECEIVING HIS LETTER OF REMOVAL HE REGARDED THE NOTICE OF HIS ACTION WHICH THE LAW REQUIRED HIM TO SEND THE COUNCIL AS A MERE FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT OF AN ACCOMPLISHED FACT THE FRIENDS OF MR JONES IMMEDIATELY SET TO WORK TO FIND SOME MEANS OF PREVENTING THIS SUMMARY OUSTING OF THE SUPERINTENDENT THEY ACCOMPLISHED TWO THINGS FIRST

THAT THE SCHOOL DIRECTOR HAD ACTED CONTRARY TO LAW FOR WHETHER HE HAD SUFFICIENT CAUSE FOR THE REMOVAL OF THE SUPERIN TENDENT COULD ONLY BE DETERMINED AFTER HE HAD NOTIFIED THE SUPERIN TENDENT OF THE SPECIAL CHARGES MADE AGAINST HIM AND GIVEN HIM AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE HIS DEFENCE IT WAS A MATTER OF NO SURPRISE WHEN THE CORPORATION COUNSEL CALLED UPON BY THE SCHOOL DIRECTOR TO ASSUME HIS DEFENCE IN THE INJUNCTION PROCEEDINGS PRACTICALLY REFUSED TO DO SO PRONOUNCING THE DIRECTORS POSITION UNTENABLE THE DIRECTOR NOT YET WILLING TO ADMIT DEFEAT NEXT SOUGHT THE ADVICE OF A PRIVATE LAWYER BUT THE BEST THIS LAWYER COULD DO FOR HIM WAS TO DISCOVER A TECHNICAL FLAW IN THE PETITION FOR THE INJUNCTION CONVINCED AT LAST THAT HE HAD ERRED AND PROBABLY SOMEWHAT INFLUENCED BY THE SEVERE CONDEMNATION OF HIS COURSE EXPRESSED BY THE ENTIRE RESPECTABLE PRESS OF THE CITYINCLUD ING THE MORNING REPUBLICAN THAT HAD ADVOCATED HIS ELECTION THE DIRECTOR ON JULY 6 SENT A SECOND LETTER TO MR JONES  REVOKING

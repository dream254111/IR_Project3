estimated in parts of the English standard By Captain Henry Kater F R S Read February 5 r818 ONE of the objects of the committee of the Royal Society appointed for the purpose of determining the length of the seconds pendulum being the comparison of the French metre with the British standard measure two metres were procured from Paris for that purpose the one made in the usual man ner and called the metre a bouts and the other a bar of platina on which the length of the m6tre is shown by two very fine lines this is named the inetre a traits The width of the melre a bouts is one inch and its thickness 03 of an inch On one side the word  METRE  is engraved and on the other  FORTIN a PARIS The terminating planes are supposed to be perfectly parallel and the distance between them is the length of the metre The metre a traits is the same width as the metre a bouts but only a quarter of an inch thick The lines expressing the length of the metre are so fine that one of them is scarcely perceptible even with the assistance of a microscope unless the light be very favourable The situation of the lines may however be discovered by two strong black dots made with a graver at the extremities of each and a fine line crosses them at right angles to indicate the parts from which the measurements are to be taken This metre previous to being brought from Paris was10apt KATER On te ength of te French metre compared with a standard m6tre by M ARAGO with all that care and ability which he is so well known to possess and which so delicate an operation requires The result was that the distance between the lines was found to be less than a metre by 7  of a mllirntre or 00069 of an inch The same micrometer microscopes were usedfin the com parisons which I am about to detail as have been already described in my account of experiments on the length of the pendulum in the Philosophical Transactions of the present year and as the length of the m itre is nearly 394 inches I was enabled to refer it to the same divisions of Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGHS scale as I had employed in the measurement of the pendulum I commenced with the metre a traits It was placed in contact with the standard scale their surfaces being in the same plane An excellent thermometer was laid upon the scale and a piece of thick leather was placed upn its bulb in order to prevent its being affected by heat from the person of the observer The whole was suffered to remain in this state for two or three days after which the following observations were made at various times the microscopes being brought alter nately over the mrtre and the scale The value of each division of the micrometer is of an inch  For the manner in which this value was obtained see page Si of the precedin paperestimated

length of the metre in inches of Sir 93 G SHUCKBURGHS scale is  J 3937076 The comparison of the mdtre a bouts presented considerable difficulties which I conceive it would be of little use to detail as the necessity of comparisons of this kind is of very rare occurrence I shall therefore proceed to describe the method vwhich was at last found successful  See page 54 MDCCCXVIII P1o6 Capt KATER on the length of the French metre Four rectangular pieces of brass were prepared precisely similar to those described in the account of experiments on the pendulum in the Philosophical Transactions before referred to These were marked C c D and d The per fectly plane rectangular edges of the pieces C and c being placed in contact and kept thus by means of a spring the distance of the fine lines drawn on their surfaces parallel and very near to the rectangular edges was found to be 5005 divisions of the micrometer and the pieces D and d being placed in like manner in contact the distance of the lines on their surfaces estimated in the same divisions was 44567 The metre a bouts being placed by the side of the brass scale and in contact with it the pieces D and d were applied to its extremities the surfaces of the brass pieces being a little below the surface of the metre in order to preclude any error which might have arisen from the edges of the mnetre projecting beyond its terminating planes Each of the brass pieces was supported in this position upon a piece of lead of a sufficient thickness and kept in close contact with the end of the metre by means of a slight spring bearing against a pin driven perpendicularly into the lead In order to ensure a perfect contact between each brass piece and the terminating plane of the metre a flat ruler of brass was laid upon the surface of the metre so as to project beyond its extremity and the end of the lead was elevated or depressed so that the line of light seen between the piece of brass and the ruler the eye being level with the surface of the brass appeared to be equal in every part when it was infrred that the surfaces of the metre and of the piece ofestimated ia p1artsf to it Englsh standar 107 brass were parallel and consequently that their rectangular ends were perfctly in contact The distance between the lines on D and d was now taken by the microscoes and transferred to the scale in the manner before described  and when a sufficient number of compari sons had thus been made the pieces D and d were exchanged for those marked C and c and the observations repeated with every precaution to ensure an accurate result especially with respect to temperature The under surface of the mitre was then placed upper most and the apparats being arranged as befre the same process was pursued as that which has just been described The results are contained in the following tables Comparison of the tre d bouts i The pieces D and d applied Distanc from D to d 4567  rdivisions The word MTRE above R e

scale 3937 The following is the manner in which the correction for temperature was obtained The expansion of platina accord ing to the experiments of BORDA and others is oooo0476estinated in parts of the English standard parts of its length for one degree of FAHRENHEIT and as this is the expansion used by the French in adjusting the length of their metre it must be employed on the present occasion The metre being taken at 3o the expansion for the difference between this and the temperature of measure ment must be subtracted from the apparent length of the metre The English standard temperature is 620 therefore if the temperature of measurement be under this the expan sion of the scale for such difference of temperature must be deducted from the length of the metre before obtained These two corrections are combined in the column entitled  correction for temperature Sir G SHUCKBURGHS standard scale is of cast brass and as I could not conveniently deter mine its actual expansion with that degree of accuracy that would have satisfied me I have taken for it the mean result of two experiments made on plate brass which gave me an expansion of ooooiol parts of its length for one degree of FAHRENHEIT The mean of most of tile experiments made on the expansion of brass gives oooo1o4 and had Iemployed this last number instead of my own the difference in the length of the metre would have been utterly inconsiderable Supposing then both metres to be of equal authority we have for the length of the metre a traits 3937076 and for that of the metre d bouts 3937081 inches the mean of which 3937079 may be taken for the length of the metre in inches of Sir G SHUCKBURGHS standard scale when each is brought to its proper temperature  The length of the metre compared with BIRDs parliamentary standard is 3937O62 inches London November 18 X 7 lo9

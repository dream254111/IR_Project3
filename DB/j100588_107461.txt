J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107461,ON THE LENGTH OF THE FRENCH METRE ESTIMATED IN PARTS OF THE ENGLISH STANDARD,I206973,103 J V ON THE LENGTH OF THE FRENCH METRE ESTIMATED IN PARTS OF THE ENGLISH STANDARD BY CAPTAIN HENRY KATER F R S READ FEBRUARY 5 R818 ONE OF THE OBJECTS OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY APPOINTED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING THE LENGTH OF THE SECONDS PENDULUM BEING THE COMPARISON OF THE FRENCH METRE WITH THE BRITISH STANDARD MEASURE TWO METRES WERE PROCURED FROM PARIS FOR THAT PURPOSE THE ONE MADE IN THE USUAL MAN NER AND CALLED THE METRE A BOUTS AND THE OTHER A BAR OF PLATINA ON WHICH THE LENGTH OF THE M6TRE IS SHOWN BY TWO VERY FINE LINES THIS IS NAMED THE INETRE A TRAITS THE WIDTH OF THE MELRE A BOUTS IS ONE INCH AND ITS THICKNESS 03 OF AN INCH ON ONE SIDE THE WORD  METRE  IS ENGRAVED AND ON THE OTHER  FORTIN A PARIS THE TERMINATING PLANES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE PERFECTLY PARALLEL AND THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM IS THE LENGTH OF THE METRE THE METRE A TRAITS IS THE SAME WIDTH AS THE METRE A BOUTS BUT ONLY A QUARTER OF AN INCH THICK THE LINES EXPRESSING THE LENGTH OF THE METRE ARE SO FINE THAT ONE OF THEM IS SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE EVEN WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF A MICROSCOPE UNLESS THE LIGHT BE VERY FAVOURABLE THE SITUATION OF THE LINES MAY HOWEVER BE DISCOVERED BY TWO STRONG BLACK DOTS MADE WITH A GRAVER AT THE EXTREMITIES OF EACH AND A FINE LINE CROSSES THEM AT RIGHT ANGLES TO INDICATE THE PARTS FROM WHICH THE MEASUREMENTS ARE TO BE TAKEN THIS METRE PREVIOUS TO BEING BROUGHT FROM PARIS WAS10APT KATER ON TE ENGTH OF TE FRENCH METRE COMPARED WITH A STANDARD M6TRE BY M ARAGO WITH ALL THAT CARE AND ABILITY WHICH HE IS SO WELL KNOWN TO POSSESS AND WHICH SO DELICATE AN OPERATION REQUIRES THE RESULT WAS THAT THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE LINES WAS FOUND TO BE LESS THAN A METRE BY 7  OF A MLLIRNTRE OR 00069 OF AN INCH THE SAME MICROMETER MICROSCOPES WERE USEDFIN THE COM PARISONS WHICH I AM ABOUT TO DETAIL AS HAVE BEEN ALREADY DESCRIBED IN MY ACCOUNT OF EXPERIMENTS ON THE LENGTH OF THE PENDULUM IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE PRESENT YEAR AND AS THE LENGTH OF THE M ITRE IS NEARLY 394 INCHES I WAS ENABLED TO REFER IT TO THE SAME DIVISIONS OF SIR GEORGE SHUCKBURGHS SCALE AS I HAD EMPLOYED IN THE MEASUREMENT OF THE PENDULUM I COMMENCED WITH THE METRE A TRAITS IT WAS PLACED IN CONTACT WITH THE STANDARD SCALE THEIR SURFACES BEING IN THE SAME PLANE AN EXCELLENT THERMOMETER WAS LAID UPON THE SCALE AND A PIECE OF THICK LEATHER WAS PLACED UPN ITS BULB IN ORDER TO PREVENT ITS BEING AFFECTED BY HEAT FROM THE PERSON OF THE OBSERVER THE WHOLE WAS SUFFERED TO REMAIN IN THIS STATE FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS AFTER WHICH THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE AT VARIOUS TIMES THE MICROSCOPES BEING BROUGHT ALTER NATELY OVER THE MRTRE AND THE SCALE THE VALUE OF EACH DIVISION OF THE MICROMETER IS OF AN INCH  FOR THE MANNER IN WHICH THIS VALUE WAS OBTAINED SEE PAGE SI OF THE PRECEDIN PAPERESTIMATED

EXTREMITIES THE SURFACES OF THE BRASS PIECES BEING A LITTLE BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE METRE IN ORDER TO PRECLUDE ANY ERROR WHICH MIGHT HAVE ARISEN FROM THE EDGES OF THE MNETRE PROJECTING BEYOND ITS TERMINATING PLANES EACH OF THE BRASS PIECES WAS SUPPORTED IN THIS POSITION UPON A PIECE OF LEAD OF A SUFFICIENT THICKNESS AND KEPT IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE END OF THE METRE BY MEANS OF A SLIGHT SPRING BEARING AGAINST A PIN DRIVEN PERPENDICULARLY INTO THE LEAD IN ORDER TO ENSURE A PERFECT CONTACT BETWEEN EACH BRASS PIECE AND THE TERMINATING PLANE OF THE METRE A FLAT RULER OF BRASS WAS LAID UPON THE SURFACE OF THE METRE SO AS TO PROJECT BEYOND ITS EXTREMITY AND THE END OF THE LEAD WAS ELEVATED OR DEPRESSED SO THAT THE LINE OF LIGHT SEEN BETWEEN THE PIECE OF BRASS AND THE RULER THE EYE BEING LEVEL WITH THE SURFACE OF THE BRASS APPEARED TO BE EQUAL IN EVERY PART WHEN IT WAS INFRRED THAT THE SURFACES OF THE METRE AND OF THE PIECE OFESTIMATED IA P1ARTSF TO IT ENGLSH STANDAR 107 BRASS

J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1075968,THE PSYCHOLOGICAL BACKGROUND OF INDIRECT DISCOURSE,I244545,THE PSYCHOLOGICAL BACKGROUND OF INDIRECT DISCOURSE I PSYCHOLOGICALLY SPEAKING THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS GIVING DIRECTLY THE WORDS OR THOUGHTS OF ANOTHER PERSON FOR BEFORE WE CAN EXPRESS THESE THOUGHTS THEY MUST PASS INTO OUR OWN MINDS AND OUR EXPRESSION IS THEN STRICTLY SPEAKING MERELY THE EXPRESSION OF A SECTION OF OUR OWN CONSCIOUSNESS STILL THE DISTINCTION WHICH WE MAKE BETWEEN DIRECT AND INDIRECT DISCOURSE CAN BE JUSTIFIED IN PSYCHOLOGY AS WELL AS IN GRAMMAR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO IS THAT IN DIRECT DISCOURSE WE MAKE A POSITIVE EFFORT TO ELIMINATE THE WORK OF OUR MINDS AND TO REPORT MERELY THE RECORD OF OUR SENSES WHILE IN INDIRECT DISCOURSE WE DO NOT MAKE THIS EFFORT BUT SIMPLY GIVE EXPRESSION TO THE THOUGHTS OF THE OTHER PERSON EXACTLY AS THEY LIE IN OUR OWN CONSCIOUSNESS AT THE TIME THIS BEING THE CASE A PSYCHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION OF INDIRECT DISCOURSE WILL HAVE TO DO WITH THE STATE OR STATES OF THE MIND WHICH RESULT FROM ITS CONTACT WITH FOREIGN IDEAS IN OTHER WORDS THE DISCUSSION MUST BE BASED ON A STUDY OF THE MENTAL PROCESSES WHICH ARE INVOLVED IN HEARING OR READING THE THOUGHTS OF ANOTHER PERSON TO AVOID UNNECESSARY COMPLICATIONS IN A MATTER WHICH IS AT THE BEST COMPLICATED ENOUGH WE WILL LEAVE OUT OF ACCOUNT FOR THE TIME BEING SUCH FORMS OF SPEECH AS QUESTIONS AND COMMANDS AND WILL CONFINE OURSELVES AT THE OUTSET TO THE CONSIDERATION OF DECLARATIVE STATEMENTS ADDRESSED BY ONE PERSON TO ANOTHER SAY BY A TO B TO BEGIN WITH THEN IT IS PERFECTLY CLEAR THAT THE IDEAS EXPRESSED BY A ARE NOT ALL RECEIVED WITH THE SAME READINESS IN THE MIND OF B SOME IDEAS ARE INHERENTLY MORE DIFFICULT TO GRASP THAN OTHERS BUT ENTIRELY APART FROM ITS INHERENT CHAR ACTER THE DIFFICULTY OR EASE WITH WHICH B TAKES UP AN IDEA PAPER READ AT THE CLASSICAL CONFERENCE AT ANN ARBOR MICH MARCH 27 399THE SCHOOL REVIEW EXPRESSED BY A WILL DEPEND EVEN MORE DECIDEDLY UPON WHETHER THE IDEA HAS AT SOME PREVIOUS TIME BEEN PRESENT IN BS MIND OR NOT IF THE IDEA HAS BEEN SO PRESENT AND B IS ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH IT AT THE TIME WHEN A EXPRESSES IT THEN AS STATEMENT WILL OF COURSE SERVE MERELY TO CALL IT UP AGAIN IN BS CONSCIOUSNESS THIS IS A VERY SIMPLE AND RAPID PSYCHOLOGICAL PROCESS IT REQUIRES NO APPRECIABLE TIME OR EFFORT OF B AND AS B WILL AT ONCE RECOGNIZE THE IDEA AS HIS OWN HE WILL OF COURSE UNDER ALL ORDINARY CONDITIONS NOT ASCRIBE IT TO A AT ALL EVEN THOUGH A HAS EXPRESSED IT THEREFORE IN CASE B EVER EXPRESSES THIS IDEA HE WILL NATURALLY EXPRESS IT AS HIS OWN HENCE IN SUCH A CASE INDIRECT DISCOURSE IS NOT POSSIBLE VERY DIFFERENT IS THE CASE ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN A SAYS SOMETHING WHICH B WILL NOT RECOGNIZE AS HIS OWN BUT AS AS THAT IS WHEN A TELLS B SOMETHING WHICH B DOES NOT KNOW AS YET AND WITH WHICH HIS MIND HAS HAD NO PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE IT IS ONLY UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS THAT B CAN EVER LOOK UPON AN IDEA IN HIS OWN MIND AS STILL BELONGING TO A AND IT IS ONLY IN THIS CASE THEREFORE THAT INDIRECT DISCOURSE WILL NATURALLY RESULT THIS IS THE CASE THEN THAT WE MUST NOW PROCEED TO CONSIDER IN SOME DETAIL WE FIND IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT AT THE TIME WHEN A MAKES HIS STATEMENT THE IDEA WHICH HE EXPRESSES IS A FULLY ASSIMILATED AND INTEGRAL PART OF HIS MENTAL STOCK A FINISHED PRODUCT IF WE MAY USE THE TERM WHICH IS READY FOR DELIVERY THE PROCESS OF TRANS FER FROM A TO B WILL CONSIST OF TWO PARTS THE FIRST IS THE UTTER ANCE OF A THE SECOND IS THE MENTAL ACTIVITY OF B BY WHICH THE IDEA IS EITHER ACCOMMODATED TO THE CONTENT OF HIS MIND OR ELSE IS FOUND INCOMPATIBLE WITH IT AND IS REJECTED IF THE IDEA IS ACCEPTED BY B IT BECOMES IN DUE TIME A PART OF HIS MENTAL STOCK AND IS THEN IN THE END WITH HIM JUST WHAT IT ORIGINALLY WAS WITH A A FINISHED PRODUCT READY FOR DELIVERY THEREFORE IF UPON REACHING THIS POINT B SHOULD EXPRESS HIMSELF SO FAR AS THAT PAR TICULAR IDEA IS CONCERNED HE WOULD DO IT JUST AS A DID IT BEFORE HIM THAT IS HIS ATTITUDE TOWARD THE IDEA WOULD BE THAT OF THE FULL POSSESSOR NOW IT IS NEITHER THE ORIGINAL UTTERANCE BY A NOR THIS FINAL 400BACKGROUND OF INDIRECT DISCOURSE UTTERANCE BY B WITH WHICH WE ARE AT PRESENT CONCERNED FOR IN BOTH OF THESE UTTERANCES THE SPEAKERS ARE MERELY EXPRESSING IDEAS WHICH THEY MUST FEEL TO BE THEIR OWN INDIRECT DISCOURSE ON THE OTHER HAND HAS TO DO ONLY WITH THE EXPRESSION OF IDEAS BELONGING TO OTHER PERSONS GENUINE SPONTANEOUS INDIRECT DIS COURSE WILL THEREFORE BE EMPLOYED ONLY DURING THAT TIME WHICH FOLLOWS THE ORIGINAL UTTERANCE OF A AND PRECEDES THE COMPLETE ASSIMILATION OF THE IDEA IN THE MIND OF B THAT IS DURING THE TIME WHEN THE IDEA HAS AS YET BEEN BUT PARTIALLY OR CONDITIONALLY APPROPRIATED BY B OR IT MAY BE HAS FAILED OF ACCEPTANCE ALTO GETHER FOR IT IS ONLY IN THIS PRELIMINARY STATE OF INCOMPLETE ASSIMILATION THAT THE IDEA WHILE ALREADY PRESENT IN BS MIND STILL APPEARS TO HIM TO BELONG TO A LET US THEN EXAMINE MORE CLOSELY THIS PRELIMINARY CONDITION IN WHICH THE IDEA IS TEMPORARILY DELAYED OR PERMANENTLY ARRESTED IN ITS PROGRESS TOWARD FULL ASSIMILATION IN THE MIND OF B WE FIND THAT THIS PRELIMINARY PROCESS REALLY EMBRACES TWO STAGES WHICH CAN EASILY BE DISTINGUISHED AN EARLIER AND A LATER THE CHANGE FROM THE ONE TO THE OTHER IS OCCASIONED BY A SHIFTING OF THE ATTENTION ON THE PART OF B IN THE VERY BEGINNING WHILE A IS SPEAKING BS ATTENTION IS OF COURSE FIXED MAINLY UPON HIM AND HIS ACTIONS AND IT IS NOT UNTIL A HAS DONE THAT THIS ATTENTION TURNS WITH ANY COMPLETENESS TO THE IDEA ITSELF IN THE FIRST STAGE THEREFORE THAT IS IN THE TIME DURING AND DIRECTLY FOLLOWING THE UTTERANCE OF A THE IDEA IS MARKED IN BS MIND BY AN OVER WHELMING SENSE OF THE ORIGINAL SPEAKERS AUTHORSHIP AND OWNER SHIP IT IS NOT INDEED SO MUCH AN IDEA AS IT IS AN ACTIVITY OF A THAT FILLS BS MIND AT THIS TIME BUT AS BS ATTENTION IS MORE AND MORE WITHDRAWN FROM THE SPEAKER AND CONFINED TO THE IDEA ITSELF THIS STRONG FEELING OF AS OWNERSHIP AND AUTHORSHIP OF THE IDEA WILL OF COURSE LIKE WISE GRADUALLY FADE AWAY IN BS MIND UNTIL FINALLY THE SENSE OF AS CONNECTION WITH THE IDEA BECOMES QUITE VAGUE AND DIM THIS IS THE SECOND STAGE IN THE PRELIMINARY PROCESS OF ASSIMILA TION IN WHICH THE IDEA LIES IN BS MIND AS A MORE OR LESS ABSTRACT PROPOSITION AS SO MUCH PURE THOUGHTMATTER MORE OR LESS NEU TRAL SO FAR AS RELATIONS OF OWNERSHIP TO INDIVIDUAL PERSONS ARE 401THE SCHOOL REVIEW CONCERNED AFTER THIS POINT IS REACHED IF CONDITIONS ARE FAVOR ABLE THE IDEA WILL MOVE ON INTO THE THIRD AND LAST STAGE OF ASSIMILATION AND WILL PASS COMPLETELY INTO THE POSSESSION OF B OR IN OTHER WORDS THE SENSE OF BS OWN POSSESSION OF IT WILL TAKE THE PLACE OF HIS FORMER SENSE OF AS POSSESSION WE MAY THEN ROUGHLY DESIGNATE THE THREE STAGES IN THE PRO CESS OF COMPLETE TRANSFER AND ASSIMILATION OF AN IDEA AS THEY ARE REFLECTED IN THE SUCCESSIVE STATES OF BS MIND AS FOLLOWS I IDEA  A 2 IDEA MORE OR LESS PURE 3 IDEA  B IN THOSE CASES WHERE IDEAS EXPRESSED BY A ARE BUT PARTIALLY OR CONDITION ALLY ASSIMILATED BY B OR ARE REJECTED ENTIRELY OF COURSE ONLY THE FIRST TWO OF THESE STAGES ARE EVER REACHED I IDEA  A 2 IDEA MORE OR LESS FREE FROM PERSONAL ASSOCIATIONS II FORTUNATELY WE HAVE PRESERVED TO US IN LATIN CASES OF DIRECT SPONTANEOUS EXPRESSION OF EACH OF THESE THREE STAGES IN THE ASSIMILATION OF IDEAS FOR CONVENIENCE WE WILL TAKE THEM UP IN THE REVERSE ORDER AND WILL DISCUSS FIRST THE STAGE THAT IS REACHED LAST IN THIS STAGE THE ONE IN WHICH THE IDEA HAS BEEN FULLY ABSORBED BY B AND IS COMPLETELY IN HIS POSSESSION HIS METHOD OF EXPRESSING IT WILL OF COURSE BE THE DECLARATIVE STATE MENT JUST AS IT WAS IN THE ORIGINAL EXPRESSION BY A THIS IS NOT INDIRECT DISCOURSE AND WITH THIS STAGE IN THE PROCESS WE ARE THEREFORE NOT CONCERNED EXCEPT PERHAPS IN SO FAR AS THE PAREN THETICAL REMARKS WHICH PROCEED FROM THE REPORTERS OWN KNOWL EDGE AND WHICH HAVE THE INDICATIVE IN LATIN MAY BE SAID TO HAVE A LEGITIMATE PLACE IN A DISCUSSION OF INDIRECT DISCOURSE THE SECOND STAGE IN THE PROCESS HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS THE ONE IN WHICH THE SENSE OF AS AUTHORSHIP OF THE IDEA AND THE PROMINENCE OF AS PERSONALITY IN IT HAS SO FAR AS BS CONSCIOUS NESS IS CONCERNED FADED AWAY TO A CERTAIN EXTENT IN WHICH THE IDEA IS LEFT IN BS MIND AS PURE THOUGHTMATTER WHICH IS NOT VERY CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH AN OWNER THE DIRECT EXPRESSION OF AN IDEA IN THIS STAGE MAY BE EXPECTED THEREFORE AFTER BS MIND HAS BEEN BUSY WITH THE IDEA FOR A TIME WITHOUT BEING ABLE COM PLETELY TO ASSIMILATE IT 402BACKGROUND OF INDIRECT DISCOURSE NOW IF WE STOP TO THINK ABOUT THESE EFFORTS WHICH B HAS BY THIS TIME MADE TO ASSIMILATE THE IDEA WE MUST REALIZE THAT THEY CANNOT HAVE OCCURRED WITHOUT AFFECTING THE FORM OF THE IDEA ITSELF ONE CHANGE AT LEAST THE IDEA MUST HAVE SUFFERED A CHANGE THAT EVERY IDEA UNDERGOES WHEN IT IS SUBJECTED TO MENTAL LABOR WE MEAN THE CHANGE BY WHICH THE IDEA IS INEVITABLY REDUCED TO THAT WHICH TO THE HEARERS MIND IS ITS SIMPLEST AND MOST PORTABLE SHAPE THROUGH THE ELIMINATION OF ALL THAT IS IRRELE VANT OR OF NO PRESENT CONSEQUENCE TO THE HEARER THE SPONTA NEOUS EXPRESSION OF A FOREIGN IDEA UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES MUST THEN AMOUNT TO THE EXPRESSION OF THAT PARTICULAR PHASE OF THE IDEA WHICH ESPECIALLY INTERESTS THE HEARER IN EXTANT LATIN LITERATURE WE FIND FREQUENT USE MADE OF SUCH EXPRESSIONS AT THE BEGINNINGS OF NEW SCENES IN COMEDY WHERE THE PURPOSE IS AT ONCE TO SUM UP A CONVERSATION WHICH HAS JUST BEEN CARRIED ON OFF THE STAGE AND TO SHOW THE SPEAKERS ATTITUDE TOWARD THE SUBJECT OF THIS CONVERSATION SO IN THE ADELPHI OF TERENCE 11 4479 WHEN SEVERAL NEW CHARACTERS COME UPON THE STAGE WITH THE FOLLOWING CONVERSATION HEGIO PRO DI IMMORTALES FACINUS INDIGNUM GETA QUOD NARRAS  GETA SIC EST FACTUM HEGIO EX ILLAN FAMILIA TAM INLIBERALE ESSE ORTUM FACINUS AS THIS CASE AND MANY OTHERS LIKE IT SHOW THE NATURAL MODE OF EXPRESSION IN LATIN FOR THIS THE SECOND STAGE OF ASSIMILATION IS THE INFINITIVEWHAT THE GRAMMARS CALL AN INFINITIVE EXCLAMA TION OF SURPRISE OR INCREDULITY NOT ALL INFINITIVES OF EXCLAMATION FALL UNDER THIS HEAD HOW EVER FOR BESIDES EXPRESSING THE SPEAKERS ATTITUDE TOWARD STATE MENTS OF OTHER PEOPLE THIS CONSTRUCTION MAY ALSO AND OFTEN DOES EXPRESS HIS ATTITUDE TOWARD IDEAS WHICH HAVE COME TO HIM IN OTHER WAYSFROM HIS OWN OBSERVATION EXPERIENCE OR PAST THINKING THESE OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIENCES OF THE SPEAKERS OWN ARE OFTEN FOUND BY HIM TO BE JUST AS DIFFICULT OF ASSIMILATION AS THE THINGS WHICH ARE SAID BY ANOTHER SO IN TERENCES ANDRIA 870 WHEN SIMO EXCLAIMS OVER THE WAYWARDNESS OF HIS SON TANTUM LABOREM CAPERE OB TALEM FILIUM  40371HE5 SCHOOL REVIEW SO FAR AS THE SPEAKER HIMSELF IS CONCERNED THIS INDEPENDENT USE OF THE INFINITIVE IN A CASE OF HIS OWN OBSERVATION OR EXPERIENCE IS NOT DIFFERENT FROM ITS USE WITH REFERENCE TO AN IDEA ORIGINALLY EXPRESSED BY ANOTHER PERSON IN THE LATTER CASE THE SPEAKERS SENSE OF THE ORIGINAL OWNERSHIP OR AUTHORSHIP OF THE IDEA HAS SIMPLY FADED OUT WHILE IN THE FORMER CASE SUCH A SENSE OF AUTHORSHIP NEVER EXISTED AND IN BOTH CASES THAT PHASE OF THE IDEA WHICH PARTICULARLY INTERESTS THE SPEAKER AND RECEIVES HIS WHOLE ATTENTION SEEMS AT THE TIME UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE OF COMPRE HENSION HENCE THE SURPRISE OR INCREDULITY STILL A THIRD INDEPENDENT INFINITIVE WHICH MAY BE MENTIONED IN THIS CONNECTION IS THE SOCALLED HISTORICAL INFINITIVE WHAT PROFESSOR LANE CALLED THE  INFINITIVE OF INTIMATION THIS INFIN ITIVE IS USED ESPECIALLY IN NARRATING A SERIES OF EVENTS WHICH ALL CROWD BEFORE THE SPEAKERS MIND AT ONCE OR SUCCEED EACH OTHER SO RAPIDLY THAT HE DOES NOT HAVE TIME TO GET THE INDIVIDUAL IDEAS ALL COMPLETELY UNDER HIS CONTROL IN THE CASE OF THE EXCLAMA TORY INFINITIVE WE SAW THAT THE INDIVIDUAL IDEA WAS NOT MADE THE SPEAKERS OWN BECAUSE OF ITS INCOMPATIBILITY WITH HIS EXISTING STATE OF MIND IN THE CASE OF THE INFINITIVE OF INTIMATION THE SERIES OF IDEAS IS NOT THOROUGHLY MADE HIS OWN BECAUSE OF THEIR RAPID SUCCESSION OR THEIR GREAT NUMBER OR DIVERSITY OF CHARACTER PSYCHOLOGICALLY THEREFORE THE IDEAS EXPRESSED BY THE INFINITIVE OF INTIMATION EXIST IN THE SPEAKERS MIND IN THE SAME STATE AS THOSE OTHER IDEAS PROCEEDING EITHER FROM THE STATEMENTS OF OTHER PERSONS OR FROM HIS OWN EXPERIENCE WHICH HE HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO ABSORB COMPLETELY THAT IS THESE IDEAS ARE ALL IN A STATE OF INCOMPLETE ASSOCIATION OR ASSIMILATION AND THIS INCOMPLETE ASSIMILATION IN BS MIND OF THE IDEA EXPRESSED BY A IS EXACTLY THE CONDITION OF THE IDEA WHICH IS REFLECTED IN INDIRECT DISCOURSE IF WE EXAMINE OUR MENTAL HABITS WE FIND THAT WE DO NOT BY ANY MEANS ALWAYS COMPLETELY ABSORB THE IDEAS WE HEAR EXPRESSED WE ALL MAINTAIN A CERTAIN STANDARD IN THE AMOUNT OF CORROBORA TIVE EVIDENCE WHICH WE REQUIRE OF OUR OWN MINDS BEFORE WE WILL ALLOW OURSELVES TO DECIDE WHETHER THAT WHICH SOMEONE ELSE HAS SAID IS TRUE OR FALSE WHETHER WE SHALL OURSELVES ACCEPT IT AS OUR OWN OR REJECT IT AS A MATTER OF FACT IN THE CASE OF VERY MANY 404BACKGROUND OF INDIRECT DISCOURSE THINGS THAT WE HEAR THIS STANDARD IS NEVER REACHED AT ALL AND CANNOT BE REACHED SIMPLY BECAUSE IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR US EITHER TO HAVE OR TO GET THE EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE WITH REGARD TO THE IDEA WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR A POSITIVE JUDGMENT OF OUR OWN TO BE SURE THE GENERAL CREDIBILITY OF THE PERSON SPEAKING MAY EVEN IN SUCH CASES DECIDE IN HIS FAVOR AND MAY GET US TO STATE AS A TRUTH FROM OUR OWN STANDPOINT WHAT STRICTLY SPEAKING IS A TRUTH ONLY FROM HIS STANDPOINT BUT WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE SIMPLY SAY THE THING IS SO NOT  HE SAYS IT IS SO AND THERE IS NO INDIRECT DISCOURSE WE MUST THEREFORE EXCLUDE THIS POSSI BILITY FROM OUR DISCUSSION WE HAVE AT PRESENT TO DO ONLY WITH THOSE CASES WHERE B DOES NOT FEEL COMPETENT TO PASS FINAL JUDG MENT ON WHAT A HAS SAID AND MUST THEREFORE LEAVE THE IDEA TO REST UPON ITS OWN MERITS AS AN ABSTRACT PROPOSITION OR UPON THE AUTHORITY OF THE ORIGINAL SPEAKER AND AN IDEA IN THIS STATE AFTER THE HEARERS MIND HAS BEEN AT WORK WITH IT FOR A TIME AND HIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF ITS CONNECTION WITH THE ORIGINAL SPEAKER HAS BECOME SOMEWHAT FAINT IS IN LATIN EXPRESSED AS WE SAW BY THE INFINITIVE HAVING NOW CONSIDERED THE SECOND AND THIRD STAGES WE SHALL PASS ON TO CONSIDER THE FIRST STAGE IN THE PROCESS OF ASSIMILATION AT THIS STAGE AS WE SAW THE HEARERS ATTENTION HAS NOT YET BEEN COMPLETELY TRANSFERRED FROM THE SPEAKER HIMSELF TO THE IDEA HE HAS EXPRESSED AND THE PERSONALITY OF A AND THE SENSE OF HIS AUTHORSHIP ARE THEREFORE STILL VERY STRONG AND VIVID IN BS MIND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS STAGE AND THE SECOND OR INFINITIVE STAGE WHICH WE HAVE JUST SPOKEN ABOUT IS THAT IN THIS FIRST STAGE THE MIND OF B HAS NOT YET HAD TIME TO BUSY ITSELF WITH THE IDEA THAT BEING SO WE SHOULD EXPECT THAT BS EXPRESSION UTTERED AS IT IS DIRECTLY AFTER THAT OF A WOULD PRESENT THE IDEA TO US IN PRACTICALLY THE SAME FORM IN WHICH IT WAS EXPRESSED BY A AND THIS WE FIND TO BE ACTUALLY THE CASE WITH THE EXCEPTION IN LATIN THAT THE VERB IS VERY OFTEN IN THE SUBJUNCTIVE EVEN WHEN A USED THE IMPERATIVE OR THE INDICATIVE FOR EXAMPLE AFTER AN IMPER ATIVE MOST 633 TRANIO DIC TE DATURUM UT ABEAT THEOPROPIDES EGON DICAM DARE 405THE SCHOOL REVIEW

CONSTRUCTIONS THAT REQUIRES EXPLANATION EXCEPT THE SUBJUNCTIVE BUT WHY SHOULD AN IDEA EXPRESSED BY A IN THE INDICATIVE HAVE THE SUBJUNCTIVE WHEN IT IS EXPRESSED BY B FROM THE EXAMPLES GIVEN IT IS CLEAR THAT THE CHANGE IN MOOD IS NOT DUE TO WHAT A SAYS OR THE WAY IN WHICH HE SAYS IT BUT THAT IT MUST BE DUE TO SOMETHING IN THE STATE OF BS MIND WHEN HE HEARS IT OR IN OTHER WORDS TO THE EFFECT PRODUCED UPON B BY THE MERE FACT OF AS UTTERANCE FOR AS WE SAW B USES THE SUBJUNCTIVE IN HIS RETORT EXACTLY IN THE SAME WAY WHETHER AS ORIGINAL EXPRESSION WAS A STATEMENT A QUESTION OR A COMMAND IF WE EXAMINE THESE THREE CASES INDIVIDUALLY WE CAN READILY UNDERSTAND WHY AN IMPERATIVE SHOULD CHANGE TO A SUBJUNCTIVE FOR WHEN A GIVES A COMMAND TO B THE LATTER WOULD NATURALLY UPON APPLYING IT TO HIMSELF I E THE FIRST PERSON EXPRESS IT BY THE SUBJUNCTIVE FOR IN THE FIRST AND THIRD PERSON THE SUBJUNCTIVE REGULARLY PERFORMS THE SAME FUNC TIONS THAT THE IMPERATIVE PERFORMS IN THE SECOND PERSON BUT WHY B SHOULD ALSO USE THE SUBJUNCTIVE TO EXPRESS HIS MIND UPON HEARING STATEMENTS AND QUESTIONS THAT ARE PUT BY A IN THE INDI CATIVE IS NOT SO EASY TO SEE IN LOOKING FOR THE EXPLANATION OF THIS PECULIAR PHENOMENON WE NEED TO REALIZE THAT IT IS IN NO SENSE AN EXCEPTIONAL BUT RATHER A THOROUGHLY UNIVERSAL STATE OF AFFAIRS WITH WHICH WE HAVE TO DEAL FOR WE FIND THIS EXCHANGE OF MOOD IN INDIRECT DISCOURSE IN GREEK AND THE GERMANIC LANGUAGES NO LESS THAN IN LATIN WE ARE FULLY JUSTIFIED IN ASSERTING THEREFORE THAT THE CHANGE IS DUE TO A GENERAL CAUSE OPERATING IN ALL CASES ALIKE OR IN OTHER WORDS THAT THERE MUST BE SOME COMMON FUNDAMENTAL UNIVERSAL CHARACTERISTIC OF THE HEARERS STATE OF MIND IN THIS EARLIEST STAGE 406BACKGROUND OF INDIRECT DISCOURSE OF THE PROCESS OF ASSIMILATION WHICH HAS LED HIM TO EXPRESS HIM SELF IN THE SAME WAY WHETHER IT BE A STATEMENT THAT HE HEARS OR A COMMAND OR A QUESTION WHETHER IT BE AN INDICATIVE A SUB JUNCTIVE OR AN IMPERATIVE BUT WHAT IS THIS PERVADING QUALITY OF THE HEARERS CONSCIOUSNESS AND WHAT FORCE OF THE SUBJUNCTIVE OR OPTATIVE IS IT THAT MAKES THIS MOOD HIS NATURAL MEDIUM OF EXPRESSION WE SAW AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR DISCUSSION THAT AN IDEA EXPRESSED BY A HAS EITHER BEEN PREVIOUSLY PRESENT IN THE MIND OF B OR IT HAS NOT BEEN PRESENT IN CASE IT HAS BEEN PRESENT THE ONLY ACTIVITY AROUSED IN BS MIND BY AS UTTERANCE IS THE SIMPLE RECOGNITION OF THE IDEA WHICH IS ALREADY IN HIS POSSES SION IN THIS CASE WE SAW THAT INDIRECT DISCOURSE WAS IMPOSSIBLE ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN AS IDEA IS NEW TO B THEN A MORE OR LESS LENGTHY PROCESS OF ASSIMILATION IS NECESSARY IN BS MIND AND WE FOUND THAT IT IS DURING THE EARLIER OR PRELIMINARY STAGES OF THIS PROCESS WHILE ASSIMILATION IS YET INCOMPLETE THAT INDIRECT DISCOURSE HAS ITS ORIGIN WHEN THE SUBJUNCTIVE IS USED THERE FORE TO EXPRESS AN IDEA IN THE FIRST PART OF THIS STATE OF INCOM PLETE ASSIMILATION IT MUST HAVE THAT FORCE WHICH WILL REFLECT THE PECULIAR CHARACTERISTIC WHICH DISTINGUISHES THE MENTAL PROCESS OF ACTIVE ASSIMILATION FROM THAT OF MERE RECOGNITION AND THIS DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTIC IS EASY ENOUGH TO DETECT IT IS THE MUCH GREATER EFFORT WHICH THE MIND CONSCIOUSLY ENOUGH PUTS FORTH TO ASSIMILATE THE STRANGE IDEA TO THE ORIGINAL SPEAKER IN WHOSE MIND THE IDEA IS ALREADY ASSIMILATED THE NECESSITY OF THIS EFFORT IS OF COURSE NOT SO APPARENT BUT TO B WHO HAS THE ACTUAL WORK OF ASSIMILATION TO DO THE EFFORT IS JUST AS REAL AND NECES SARY AS THOUGH A HAD GIVEN A COMMAND TO HIS MENTAL ACTIVITIES INSTEAD OF MERELY MAKING A STATEMENT OR ASKING A QUESTION HENCE B AT LEAST IN THIS EARLY STAGE WHEN THE STRESS OF MENTAL WORK IS GREATEST AND THE PERSONAL ELEMENT IS MOST PROMINENT BOTH FEELS AND EXPRESSES THE FOREIGN IDEA AS IF IT WERE A DEMAND MADE UPON HIS MENTAL POWERS BY A THE SUBJUNCTIVE WOULD THEN BE THE SAME SUBJUNCTIVE AS THAT BY WHICH B RETORTS IN CASE OF A COMMAND I E IT IS A VARIETY OF WHAT WE MAY CALL THE REFLEX VOLITIVE COMMANDS STATEMENTS AND QUESTIONS ARE ALL IN THE 407THE SCHOOL REVIEW VERY EARLIEST STAGE OF ASSIMILATION FELT BY B MERELY AS COMMANDS OR AT LEAST AS DEMANDS UPON HIS ASSIMILATIVE POWERS AFTER THIS FIRST SHOCK OF COURSE AS BS MIND RECOVERS ITS EQUILIBRIUM AND GRADUALLY GAINS CONTROL OF THE IDEA INSTEAD OF BEING MASTERED BY IT AND AS AS PERSONALITY FADES FROM IT WITH THE TRANSFER OF BS ATTENTION TO THE THOUGHT THIS FEELING OF SUBJECTION TO AS BEHEST ALSO VANISHES AND THE SECOND STAGE OF THE ASSIMILATIVE PROCESS THE INFINITIVE STAGE SUPERSEDES THE FIRST OR SUBJUNCTIVE STAGE THERE ARE TWO LINES OF EXTERNAL EVIDENCE WHICH MAY BE OFFERED IN FAVOR OF THIS VIEW THAT A STRANGE IDEA THOUGH EXPRESSED IN A STATEMENT IS CONCEIVED BY THE HEARER AS A PROJEC TION OF THE SPEAKERS MIND AND PERSONALITY I E AS A DEMAND UPON HIS OWN MIND THE FIRST OF THESE PROOFS IS FURNISHED BY CERTAIN PECULIAR USES OF THE LATIN VERB VOLO VOLT AND VOLUNT FOR INSTANCE WHICH ARE THE EXTERNAL SYMBOLS OF A DEMAND BY A THIRD PERSON OR PERSONS ARE ALSO USED AS THE REGULAR MODE OF INTRODU CING THE RELIGIOUS AND PHILOSOPHICAL OPINIONS OF SUCH PERSONS THIS USE OF THE WORD IS FOUND SCORES OF TIMES IN CICEROS PHILO SOPHICAL WRITINGS FOR EXAMPLE DE NAT DEOR I 26 28 29 30 33 34 36 II 64 68 ETC BUT IN ADDITION TO PHILOSOPHICAL VIEWS VOLO DOES ALSO QUITE FREQUENTLY INTRODUCE IDEAS OR STATE MENTS OF ANY KIND AS FOR INSTANCE CIC PRO CAEL 21 53 SI TAM FAMILIARIS ERAT CLODIAE QUAM TU ESSE VIS IN OTHER WORDS A PERSONS SAYING OR THINKING SOMETHING IS LOOKED UPON AS THOUGH HE WISHED OR WANTED SOMETHING STILL MORE DECISIVE PERHAPS IS THE EVIDENCE FURNISHED IN GERMAN BY THE USE OF THE VERB SOLLEN THIS VERB THE COGNATE OF THE ENGLISH SHALL EXPRESSES OBLIGATION I E THE STATE BROUGHT ABOUT BY A COMMAND OR EXPRESSION OF WILL ON THE PART OF ANOTHER SO  ER SOLL GEHEN MEANS  I OR SOMEONE ELSE WANTS HIM TO GO BUT THIS SAME WORD IS ALSO REGULARLY USED AS A SIGN OF INDIRECT DISCOURSE TO EXPRESS THE OPINIONS OR WORDS OF SOMEONE ELSE WHICH THE SPEAKER IS NOT READY TO ADOPT AS HIS OWN SO ER SOLL FIINFZIG JAHR ALT SEIN  HE IS SAID TO BE FIFTY YEARS OLD STILL FURTHER AND THIS WE MUST NOT NEGLECT TO ESTIMATE AT ITS TRUE VALUE THE SAME VERB SOLLEN IS ALSO USED TO REJECT A STATEMENT BY ANOTHER IUST AS THE SUBJUNCTIVE IS USED IN LATIN SO MY STATEMENT DIES 408BACKGROUND OF INDIRECT DISCOURSE 409 IST DER KBNIG WOULD BE THROWN BACK AT ME BY THE EXCLAMATION 4 DIES SOIL DER K6NIG SEIN FINALLY IN GERMAN AS IN LATIN THE SUBJUNCTIVE IS USED WITH EXACTLY THE SAME FORCE TO EXPRESS THE IDENTICAL SHADES OF MEANING THAT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED BY THESE THREE USES OF SOLLEN NAMELY COMMAND REPORTED STATEMENT AND REJECTED STATEMENT TO SUM UP OUR WHOLE DISCUSSION IN A WORD THEN WE HAVE FOUND THAT INDIRECT DISCOURSE WILL ARISE SPONTANEOUSLY ONLY WHILE THE FOREIGN IDEA IS IN A STATE OF INCOMPLETE ASSIMILATION OF THIS PERIOD OF MENTAL ACTIVITY PRELIMINARY TO COMPLETE ASSIMILATION THE SUBJUNCTIVE IN LATIN EXPRESSES AN EARLIER AND THE INFINITIVE A LATER STAGE JOHN J SCHLICHER STATE NORMAL SCHOOL TERRE HAUTE IND

RI MOSAICI PER QUEM PROBATUR IN HISTORIA CREA TIONIS CUM GENERATIONIS UNIVERSAE METHODUM ATQ MODUM TUM VERAE PHILOSOPHIAE PRINCIPIA STRICTIM ATQ BREVITER TRADI LONDINI 1702 IN 40 MANY PERSONS HAVING CAVILLD AT THE MOSAICAL COSMO PAEIA AS UNPHILOSOPHICALLY WRITTEN THIS LEARNED AUTHOR HERE TAKES UPON HIM TO SHEW THAT MOSES IN HIS HISTORY OF THE CREATION HAS BRIEFLY DELIVERD BOTH THE PRINCIPLES OF TRUE PHILOSOPHY AND THE METHOD AND MAN NER OF ALL GENERATION UNDERTAKING TO ELUCIDATE THE MO SAICK PHILOSOPHY AND CONCEIVING IT CANNOT BE BETTER DONE THAN BY THE CORPUSCULARIAN OR ATOMICAL PHILOSOPHY AS BEING MOST SITTED FOR EXPLAINING AND PROVING THE GENERATI ON OF THINGS HE HAS THOUGHT IT NECESSARY IN THE FIRST PLACE TO REMOVE THAT GREAT PREJUDICE WHICH MANY LEARNED MEN HAVE HAD AGAINST THIS KIND OF PHILOSOPHY AND HAVING INTIMATED ITS ANTIQUITY HE SAYS THAT ALL THE ANCIENT GREEK CORPUSCU LARIAN PHILOSOPHERS BEFORE ANAXIMENDER WHO WAS DISCI PLE AND SUCCESSOR TO THALES MAINTAIND A DEITY WHICH HE DENYED AND INITIATED MANY ATHEISTICAL PHILOSOPHERS AMONG THE IONICKS TILL ANAXAGORAS THAT FAMOUS CORPUSCU LARIAN RESTORED THE DOCTRINE OF THALES AND TO THE PARTI CLES OF CORPUSELES AS THALES HAD DONE BEFORE ADDED A MIND THAT IS GOD TO WORK ALL THINGS AND THE AUTHOR SAYS AFTERWARD ALL EXCEPTING EPICURUS AND HIS FOLLOWERS GRANTING THESE PRINCIPLES WERE SO FAR FROM THINKING THE WORLD1064 WORLD COULD BE MADE BY CHANCE THAT THEY HELD AN INFINITE WISDOM OR MIND DIRECTING ALL THINGS THAT IS A GOD WHOLLY NECESSARY FOR IT WHO FROM AN INFORM AND CONFUSD MAT TER MADE AND ESTABLISHT THIS WONDERFUL ORDER AND ORNAMENT WE SEE HE URGES THE EXCELLENCY OF THE MOSAICK PHILOSOPHY FROM ITS ANTIQUITY AS HAVING BEEN DERIVD BY A CONTINUED TRADITION FROM OUR FIRST PARENTS THAT NOAH RECEIVED IT AND HIS SONS ESPECIALLY SEM AND JAPHETH IT IS NOT TO BE DOUBTED WHO WE MAY BELIEVE TOOK CARE TO CONVEY IT TO POSTERITY AND THO MANKIND SELL BY DEGREES FROM PIETY TO A LICENTIOUSNESS IN ALL VICE SO THAT ALL IN A MANNER NEG LECTED OR WHOLLY DESPISD THEIR CREATOR WHEREBY THEIR MINDS WERE BLINDED AS TO THE NOTIONS THEY HAD IMBIBD CONCERNING GOD AND NATURE SO THAT WHATEVER DOCTRINES THEY SET UP AFTERWARD CONCERNING BEGINNINGS WERE VERY OBSCURE AND IMPERFECT OR TRIVIAL AND FALSE YET IN THE FA MILY OF HEBER THE TRUE KNOWLEDGE CONTINUED LONGER WHO DELIVERD IT TO THE HEBREWS DESCENDED FROM HIM AND HE THINKS NO PRINCIPLES OF PHILOSOPHY MAY BE FOUND WHICH MORE APTLY AGREE BOTH TO CHEMICAL AND MECHANICAL EXPE RIENCE OR SO FITLY QUADRATE TO THOSE THINGS THAT NOW OFFER AS THOSE WHICH MAY BE FORMD AND DRAWN ACCORDING TO THE SEAT OF THE MOSAICK WISDOM AND THEN HE LAYS DOWN THE FOUR SOLLOWING PROPOSITIONS AS A FOUNDATION TO BUILD HIS DOCTRINE UPON 1 THAT THE WISDOM OF THE MOSAICK COSMOLOGY CAN SCARCE BE UNDERSTOOD UNLESS WE FIRST KNOW THOSE PRINCIPLES OF PHILOSOPHY WHICH MOSES HAD REGARD TO WHEN HE APPLYD HIMSELF TO WRITE OF THE ORIGIN OF ALL THINGS 2 THOSE PRINCIPLES CAN NEITHER BE DISCERNED BY REASON NOR BE WELL CONJECTURD AT UNLESS WE FIRST KNOW WHAT PRINCIPLES OF PHILOSOPHY PREVAILD IN THAT AGE 3 THAT THE PHILOSOPHY OF THAT AGE WAS CORPUSCULARY HOLDING THAT WHATSOEVER WAS CONTAIND WITHIN THE HEAVNS AND1065 AND TERRAQUEOUS GLOBE WAS MADE OF MOST SUBTLE PARTI CLES 4 THAT THIS WAY OF PHILOSOPHIZING DID NOT ONLY PRE VAIL OVER ONE OR TWO PROVINCES BUT WAS DIFFUSD IN A MANNER THRO ALL NATIONS WHO APPLYD THEMSELVES TO THE SPECULATION OF NATURE THO ESPECIALLY AS TIS BELIEVED THRO PHAENICIA AEGYPT IDUMAEA AND ARABIA UPON A DILIGENT ENQUIRY AFTER THAT KNOWLEDGE OF NA TURE IN WHICH THE SONS OF NOAH FORMERLY CONCURRD NO EXPLICATION OF NATURE SEEMS TO HIM MORE FAVOURED NONE MORE TRUE AND ANCIENT THAN THAT WHICH TEACHES THAT ALL CONCRETIONS MADE FROM THE BEGINNING AND ALL GENERATI ONS AFTERWARDS RISE FROM MINUTE CORPUSELES OR ATOMS THESE HE SAYS WERE THOSE PRINCIPLES OF PHILOSOPHIZING WHICH ALL NATURAL PHILOSOPHERS AEGYPTIANS PHAENICIANS ARABIANS HEBREWS SYRIANS INDIANS BRITTAINS AND GREEKS EMBRACD FROM ALL ANCIENT TIME AND WHICH WERE USD AS KEYS FOR OPENING THE SECRETS OF NATURE TILL ABOUT THE YEAR OF THE WORLD 3560 NOW HE SAYS THO THE MOST ANCIENT SAGES BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER THE FLOOD HAD THE SAME SENTIMENTS OF THE NA TURE OF THINGS AND LAID DOWN THE SAME FOUNDATION OF PHILOSOPHIZING YET THEY GAVE NOT THE SAME NAMES TO THEIR PRINCIPLES FOR SOME CALLED THE MATTER OF ALL THINGS TO BE GENERATED WATERS OTHERS EITHER SAND OR DUST OR PARTICLES OR ATOMS OR MONADS AS THE PYTHAGOREANS THE HEBREW TECHNICAL WORD WHICH IS GIVEN TO THE PRINCIPLE OF NATURAL THINGS IS CHIUK WHICH SIGNIFIES SAND AND THE ARABICK WORD IS HIULE OR HIUL WHICH SIGNIFIES THE SIRST MATTER AND ALSO SAND FROM HALA WHICH IS TO POUR FORTH SAND WHENCE HALON IS POURED FORTH NOW FROM THESE HEBREW AND ARABICK WORDS THE AEGYPTIANS SYRIANS AND GREEKS TOOK THEIR WORD HYLE TO DENOTE THE SAME AND THE PHAENICIANS ILUS BOTH WHICH WORDS ALSO AT FIRST SIGNIFIED MINUTE PARTICLES SEVERD LIKE SAND MOSES FIRST CALLD ALL THE MATTER OF WHICH THE WORLD WAS MADE HEAVN AND EARTH1086 EARTH THEN EARTH ALONE THEN BY REASON OF THE PROFUN DITY THE ABYSS AND THEN WATERS THO HE SCARCE THINKS THIS WORD WAS FIRST USD BY MOSES TO NOTIFY THE MATTER OF THE WORLD BUT LOOKS UPON IT AS IN USE WITH PHILOSO PHERS FOR SOME AGES BEFORE AND PERHAPS BEFORE THE TIMES OF ABRAHAM BECAUSE WE READ THAT THE DRUIDES IN EUROPE AND THE BRACHMANS IN INDIA ALWAYS THOUGHT WATER TO BE THE PRINCIPLE OF THINGS AND THERE ARE LEARNED MEN THAT SAY THE LATTER WERE TAUGHT THEIR PHILOSOPHY BY ABRAHAM AND MAGASTHONES IN HIS INDIA SAYS THAT THE SAME PRINCIPLES OF PHILOSOPHY THAT FLOURISHT IN GREECE WERE AN TIENTLY USED IN INDIA AMONG THE BRACHMANS AND IF WE BELIEVE AVENTINUS IN THE TIME OF HERMION KING OF THE GERMANS WHO REIGND WHEN ISAAC WAS NOT 40 YEARS OF AGE COLLEDGES OF THE DRUIDES WERE FLOURISHING NEXT HAVING PREMITTED SOME THINGS CONCERNING THE CHAOS AND THE EXTENT OF THE MOSAICK CREATION HE PROCEEDS TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF THE SIX DAYS WORK WHERE HE HAS SHEWN MUCH LEARNING IN SETTING FORTH HOW ALL THINGS PAST IN A NATURAL ORDER THEN HE TELLS US OF THE CREATION OF MATTER OR THE CHAOS CONTRARY TO THE OPINION OF THOSE WHO HELD MATTER ETERNAL WRONGLY GROUNDING THEMSELVES ON THIS MAXIM NOTHING IS MADE OF NOTHING WHICH MAXIM WAS INTRODUCED BY THE FIRST PHILOSOPHERS WHO WERE CORPUS CULARIANS AND HELD ONLY TWO PRINCIPLES OF ALL GENERATIONS VIZ AN ACTIVE POWER WHICH WAS SPIRITUAL AND INCORPOREAL AAD A PASSIVE VIZ MATTER AND APPREHENDED NOTHING IN THE NATURE OF BODY BESIDE MATTER VARIOUS WAYS DISPOSED BY MAGNITUDE FIGURE LIFE AND MOTION OR REST CONCEIVING IN NO GENERATION A NEW SUBSTANCE TO BE PRODUCED BUT ONLY THE OLD TO BE MIXT AND CHANGD AFTER OTHER WAYS SO THAT A NEW SPECIES OF THINGS ARISES AS ANOTHER MIXTURE AND TURN OF MATTER GIVE IT NEW SORMS AND QUALITIES NOT THAT THEY THOUGHT THOSE FORMS AND QUALITIES HAD A REAL EX ISTENCE IN THAT THING TO WHICH THEY WERE SAID TO BELONG BUT THAT THEY ARE ONLY OUR SENSATIONS TO WHICH THEY SEEM TO1087 TO HAVE A BEING FOR IF THEY HAD A REAL BEING NEW ENTITIES WOULD ARISE DAILY FROM NOTHING BY ORDINARY GENERATION WHICH WOULD BE ABSURD TO THINK THEREFORE THEY WISELY INCULCATED THE ABOVEMENTIOND MAXIME NOTHING IS GENE RATED OF NOTHING VIZ BY THE POWER OF NATURE FOR THEY UNDERSTOOD IT OF NATURAL PRODUCTIONS AND BROUGHT IT IN TO TAKE AWAY QUALITIES AND SUBSTANTIAL FORMS BUT PHILOSO PHERS OF AFTER AGES WRESTED THE FORCE OF THAT MAXIME TO SET UP AN AETERNITY OF MATTER CONCEIVING IT ABSOLUTELY AND AL WAYS NECESSARY THAT WHATSOEVER ARISES BE GENERATED FROM ANOTHER THING EITHER BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THAT NOTHING BUT WHAT IS MATERIAL AND CORPOREAL EVER EXISTED WHICH BE CAUSE IT COULD NOT MAKE IT SELF THEY BELIEVD TO BE ETER NAL OR IF THEY DENYED NOT AN IMMATERIAL POWER OR A GOD YET THEY CONSIDERD NOT HIS OMNIPOTENCY AS ABLE TO CREATE MATTER OF NOTHING OR IF THEY THOUGHT IT COULD BE CREATED BY GOD WHY DO THEY THINK IT WAS NOT CREATED BUT EXISTED BEFORE THE WORLD WAS MADE SINCE MATTER EX ISTING NOTHING WAS WANTING BUT MOTION FOR THE FORMATI ON OF THE HEAVNS AND EARTH SPEAKING CONCERNING THE MOTION OF MATTER HE SAYS GOD GAVE IT THAT MOTION AND AT THE MOTION OF THE MAT TER WHICH HE EXCITED HE CREATED THAT POWER WHICH WE CALL NATURE THIS BEING NOTHING BUT THE MOTION OF MATTER MADE ACCORDING TO THE LAWS WHICH THE PRIME AUTHOR OF NATURE ESTABLISHT IN THE BEGINNING HE TREATS NEXT OF THE PRIMIGENIAL FIRE AND LIGHT OR OF THE FIRST HEAVEN AND SHEWS AFTER WHAT ORDER IT WAS MADE UPON A MOTION OF THE PARTICLES AND SAYS IT PLEASD GOD AMONG THOSE WORKS WHICH HE PUT UNDER THE LAWS OF NA TURE FROM THE BEGINNING TO INSTITUTE SOME GREAT MIRACLES HERE AND THERE ABOVE THE POWER OF NATURE MORE SIGNAL LY TO SHEW HE WAS LORD OF THE FRAME OF THE WORLD AND THAT THE DIVINE MIND IS ALWAYS TO GIVE RULE TO NATURE AND SHEWS BY MANY SUGGESTIONS AND CHYMICAL EXPERI MENTS THAT ITS NO ABSURDITY IN REASON TO ADMIT THE SU H H H H H H H PER1088 PERCAELESTIAL WATERS INTIMATED BY MOSES WHATSOEVER SOME MAY OBJECT TREATING OF THE EXPANSUM OR INFERIOUR HEAVN HE SAYS THAT ACCORDING TO THE MOSAICK PHYSIOLOGY THE HEAVNS GE NERATED OF THE ABYSSINE OR CHAOTICK WATERS ARE DIVIDED ONLY INTO TWO ORBS CALLD BY THE NAMES OF THE SUPERIOUR AND INFERIOUR HEAVNS THO OTHERS HAVE MADE SEVERAL CAE LESTIAL ORBS AND HAVING SPOKE OF THE SUPERIOUR HEAVN IN THE FOREGOING CHAPTER HE TELLS US HERE THAT THE INFERIOUR HEAVN THE WORK OF THE SECOND DAY IS CALLD BY MOSES THE EXPANSUM AND COMPREHENDS ALL THE SPACE FROM THE TERRAQUEOUS ORB TO THE EMPYREAL HEAVN OR THE AETHER THO WITH THIS DISTINCTION THAT ITS SUPERIOR PART WHICH IS FAR THE GREATER IS CALLD SIDEREAL THE INFERIOUR NEXT THE EARTH AERIAL AND THEN HE TELLS US HOW THIS INFERIOUR HEAVN WAS SRAMD AND AS FOR THE CAELUM CAELORUM MEN TIOND BY MOSES CALLD BY S PAUL THE THIRD HEAVN HE SAYS ITS A SUPRA MUNDANE LIGHT TO WHICH NO MORTAL CAN HAVE ACCESS TREATING OF THE CHAOTICK OR ELEMENTARY WATERS HE SAYS THAT THO MOSES AND THE BRACHMANS AND THE DRUIDES LONG BEFORE HIM SAID WATER WAS THE PRINCIPLE OF ALL THINGS YET HE THINKS NEITHER MOSES NOR THE OTHERS UNDER STOOD IT TO BE TRUE OR NATURAL WATER BUT ONLY METAPHYSI CAL VIZ THAT IMMENSE MULTITUDE OF CHAOTICK PARTICLES OF WHICH ALL THINGS WERE MADE IN THE BEGINNING WHICH WHEN THEY WERE MOVED BY GOD PRESENTED AN APPEARANCE AS IT WERE OF WATERS NOR IS THE NATURE OF WATER SPEAK ING PHILOSOPHICALLY ANY THING BUT A MULTITUDE OF ROUND AND SMOOTH PARTICLES CIRCULATING ABOUT THEIR CENTER AND HE PRODUCES MANY ARGUMENTS FOR MAKING OUT WHAT HE HAS HERE LAID DOWN TREATING OF THE CHAOTICAL AND ELEMENTARY EARTH HE TELLS US OF THE GREAT DELIGHT NATURE TAKES IN CHANGING ALL THINGS AND MAKING AGAIN THE LIKE THIS HE SAYS CAN BE PERFORMD IN ALL ELEMENTS EVEN BY THE INDUSTRY OF ART1889 ART SO NOT ONLY THE SOLAR FIRE EVERY WHERE DIFFUSD IN THE RAYS OF THE SUN BUT LIKEWISE THE KITCHEN FLAME MAY BE MADE EARTH BY NATURE AND THE HELP OF ART THIS THE BURNING OF BRICK IN A BRICKILL AND THE CALCINATION OF AN TIMONY BY THE RAYS OF THE SUN EVIDENTLY SHEW SINCE UPON BURNING THO MANY PARTS FLY AWAY IN STEAMS AND SMOAK THEY GET A CONSIDERABLE INCREASE AND WEIGHT THE SIERY PARTI CLES BEING DETAIND IN THE BURNT THING AND SO TURND INTO AN EARTHLY NATURE NOR IS THE CONVERSION OF THE SOLAR FIRE INTO EARTH UNKNOWN TO SKILFUL CHYMISTS WHO SO PREPARE SEVERAL DRY THINGS THAT THEY MAGNETICALLY ATTRACT THE MOST FERVENT RAYS OF THE SUN AND SO RETAIN THEM THAT THE GET AN EGREGIOUS AND DRY WEIGHT AND THE HERMETICK  OWE A GREAT PART OF THEIR NATURAL TINCTURE TO THE FLAM OF FIRE AGAIN HE TELLS US THE EARTH ITSELF BUT FIRST TURN INTO SALT CAN BE WHOLLY TURND INTO WATER AND THE MOST PURE WATER BY A VERY STRONG AND TEDIOUS DISTILLATI TION WITHOUT ANY ADDITION OR SCARCE ANY DIMINUTION MAY BE MADE A WHITE EARTH NOR DOES HE DOUBT BUT THE AIR ALSO AS WELL BY OTHER WAYS AS BY A VIOLENT AGITATION AND CONCUSSION OF ITS PARTS SUCH AS IS MADE BY THE WATER AND A DISCHARGING GUNS ESPECIALLY OF THOSE WHICH ARE CHARGD WITH AIR ALONE VEHEMENTLY COMPRESSD MAY BE SO BROKEN AND ATTENUATED THAT ITS BROKEN FINE PARTICLES BE ING JOINED AND AFSIXT ANEW AFTERWARD EITHER TO THEMSELVES OR TO OTHER PARTICLES MAY MAKE EITHER FIERY OR WATERY OR PERHAPS EARTHLY CONCRETIONS WHICH BEING NOW BECOME HEAVY THE ELASTICK FORCE OF THE AIR DRIVES TO THE EARTH TREATING OF THE AEGYPTIAN ISRAELITES TO SHEW THAT THEY WERE NOT SO STUPIDLY IGNORANT AS SOME PRETEND THEY WERE AND INCAPABLE OF A PHILOSOPHICAL INSTRUCTION FROM MOSES HE SAYS ITS KNOWN ALL THE POSTERITY OF ISRAEL WERE CALLD THE SONS AND HOUSE OF ISRAEL AND SO THE POSTERITY OF ABRAHAM WERE CALLD HIS HOUSE AND SONS WHOM HE COM MANDED TO KEEP THE WAYS OF JEHOVAH WHICH WERE THAT SE CRET PATH OF WISDOM WHICH IS THE KNOWLEDGE OF DIVINE H H H H H H H 2 AND1090 AND HUMANE THINGS AND OF THE CAUSES IN WHICH THESE THINGS ARE CONTAIND WHEREFORE WE MAY BELIEVE THAT ABRAHAM TRAIND HIS HOUSE WHICH GREW UP TO A PEOPLE OR NATION IN DIVINE MORAL AND NATURAL KNOWLEDGE EUPOLEMUS TESTIFIES THAT ABRAHAM WAS MOST FAMILIARLY CONVERSANT WITH THE HELIOPOLITAN PREISTS IN AEGYPT AND TAUGHT THEM THOSE SCIENCES HE BROUGHT WITH HIM ESPECIALLY THE CAELESTIAL SCIENCE ASTROLOGY VALES JACOB HAD BEEN WELL SKILD IN NATURE AND WELL SEEN IN THE WAYS OF RAISING AND FORTIFYING THE IMAGINATION AND HAD ALSO KNOWN THE ESSICACY AND PROPERTY OF THE RODS HE USD AND HAD WELL CONSIDERD THE POWERS OF THE STARS AND FIT SEASONS OR HE HAD NOT PROVIDED TO HIMSELF SO MANY SPOTTED AND RINGSTREAKD SHEEP THE SAME LEARNING WAS IN HIS CHIL DREN CONTINUED IN VIGOUR AMONG THEIR POSTERITY SO THAT THEOPHRASLUS SAYS THE JEWS WERE NATURALLY PHILOSO PHERS THEY WERE SO TRAIND TO IT FROM THEIR YOUTH MANY MORE ARGUMENTS HE PRODUCES FOR PROVING THE CONTINUANCE OF GOOD LEARNING AMONGST THE HEBREWS AND THAT IT WAS SUPPREST BY THEIR SLAVERY IN AEGYPT TREATING CONCERNING MOSES HE SAYS THERE WERE BUT SIX MEN BETWIXT HIM AND ADAM VIZ METHUSALEM NOAH SEM ISAAC INFERREDJOSEPHINFERRED AND AMRAM MOSESS FATHER SO THAT IF WE AL LOW NOT MOSES TO HAVE RECEIVD HIS KNOWLEDGE BY INSPIRA TION FROM GOD WE CANNOT DOUBT BUT HE RECEIVD BY TRA DITION WHATSOEVER THERE WAS OF LEARNING AMONG THE ANTE DILUVIAN FATHERS AND TO HAVE LEARNT THE ORIGINE OF THE UNI VERSE HE SAYS ITS WELL KNOWN ASTROLOGY AND CHYMISTRY FLOURISHT IN AEGYPT IN THE TIME OF MOSES BY WHICH THE IN WARD NATURES OF CAELESTIAL AND TERRESTRIAL THINGS ARE MADE KNOWN HIS SKILL IN CHYMISTRY APPEARD BY HIS REDUCING THE GOLDEN CALF TO A POWDER AND DISSOLVING IT IN COMMON WATER AND HE SAYS THERE IS A READY METHOD KNOWN ON LY TO PHILOSOPHERS BY WHICH METHOD GOLD HAVING A SECRET POWDER PUT INTO IT IS PRESENTLY MADE A POWDER DISSOLVABLE IN WATER AND HE CONCEIVES THIS WAY WAS USED BY MOSES IF IT BE OBJECTED ITS NO WAY LIKELY THAT MOSES TURND THE GOLDEN CALF INTO POWDER BY CHYMISTRY BUT AS ITS EX1091 EXPRESSLY SAID BY BURNING AND THAT ITS NOT PROBABLE MOSES KNEW THAT ART OF WHICH NO MENTION IS MADE IN SACRED OR PROPHANE WRITERS IT BEING A NEW INVENTION WHICH NO MAN MENTIOND BEFORE JULIUS FIRMICUS WHO WRIT ABOUT THE TIME OF THE EMPEROR CONSTANTINE TO THIS HE ANSWERS HE OWNS NO EXPRESS MENTION IS MADE OF IT IN THE SCRIPTURES BUT HE THINKS THEY ENFORCE US BY A NECESSITY OF CONSE QUENCE TO BELIEVE THAT MOSES SOMETIMES DID SOMETHING GREAT BY THAT SCIENCE AND HE SAYS ITS CLEARLY PROVD THE SCIENCE OF CHYMISTRY WAS MUCH MORE ANCIENT THAN MOSES BY THOSE MANY THINGS WHICH ARE SAID OF TUBAL CAIN OR VUL CAN SINCE WHEN MOSES SAID HE WAS A MASTER OF EVERY AR TIFICE IN IRON AND BRASS ALL THE ANCIENT SAGES UNDERSTOOD IT OF HIS SKILL IN CHYMISTRY HENCE THE AEGYPTIANS IN THAT TEMPLE WHICH AT MEMPHIS WAS DEDICATED TO VULCAN ERECT ED A SCHOOL OF CHYMISTRY WHICH THERE LONG FLOURISHD AS WE ARE TOLD BY ZOZIMUS PANOPOLITUS EUSEBIUS SYNESIUS AND OTHERS AND ABULPHARAGIUS TELLS US HE FOUND IN AN CIENT RECORDS THAT IN AEGYPT AFTER THE DELUGE THEY WERE LEARNED IN MANY SCIENCES AND ESPECIALLY IN THE SCIENCES OF CHYMISTRY TALISMANS AND BURNINGGLASSES HE ADDS ONE ARGUMENT FOR THE ANTIQUITY OF CHYMISTRY FROM GEN 6 WHERE JEHOVAH COMMANDS NOAH TO MAKE A CLEAR LIGHT FOR THE USE OF THE ARK WHICH HE DESIRES LEAVE OF THE LEARNED TO BELIEVE WAS A SPLENDOUR OF A FIERY AND SULPHUREOUS LIQUOR PREPARED BY THE ARTIFICE OF NOAH AND PUT IN VES SELS OF THE LAPIS SPECULARIS OR OF CRYSTAL OR HAPLY OF GLASS AND HUNG IN SUCH PLACES OF THE ARK TO ENLIGHTEN ALL THE CELLS OF THE ANIMALS THE SUBTLE EFFLUVIA OF THE LIQUOR ALSO SUPPORTED AND KEPT IN HEALTH THE ANIMALS WITHOUT THAT GROSS FOOD WHICH MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN NECESSARY FOR THEM AND WOULD HAVE REQUIRD MORE ROOM FOR STOWAGE THAN MAY WELL BE ACCOUNTED FOR ACCORD ING TO THOSE DIMENSIONS WE HAVE OF THE ARK AND THIS HE ENDEAVOURS TO MAKE OUT

REVISION OF THE LAWS ALONE among the states of the Union Michigan has since I850 prohibited any general revision of the laws and per mits only a compilation of laws in force without alteration As practically all the neighboring states as well as New York from which much of the early legislation of Michigan was derived have continued to revise their statutes from time to time it may be inter esting to see why Michigan alone has thought it desirable not only to stop the practice which it followed until I850 but to prevent effectually its legislature from ever attempting it in the future Michigan became a territory in I805 and from July I of that year to 1824 its legislature consisted of the governor and three judges From 1824 until statehood the legislative council first appointive then elective became the legislative body The first publication of Michigan laws was the socalled Wood ward Code now a very rare book It is a small octavo volume of 179 pages printed at Washington D C in I8o6 Judge Wood ward had been the leading spirit in the preparation and enactment of the laws adopted from July to October I805 at which time he and Governor Hull left for Washington to secure some much needed legislation from Congress on territorial subjects Wood ward remained at Washington and in the East for nearly a year and obtained authority from the Secretary of State to have the laws printed The book contains thirtyfour acts in all printed in the order in which they were adopted and as printed the sections of the acts are numbered consecutively through the book It is in no sense a code however as it does not attempt to state the whole body of the law but consists of separate enactments covering only those subjects which the new government of the territory found most essential The title page reads The Laws of Michigan Volume I fol lowed by a quotation from the 2Eneid addressed perhaps to Presi dent Jefferson whose faithful and admiring friend Judge Wood ward was The translation reads O thou to whom Jupiter hasMICHIGAN LAW REVIEW granted the founding of a new city and the ruling of proud peoples with justice The volume contains an interesting preface by Judge Woodward explaining the construction which the Governor and Judges of Michigan had given to the clause of the Ordinance of 1787 empow ering them to adopt laws Although eleven acts were adopted in I8o6 fourteen in I807 nine in I8o8 thirtyseven in I809 ten in I8IO seven in I812 the last one only three days before the surrender of Detroit there was no fur ther publication of the laws of the territory until I8i6 The Americans retook possession of Detroit September 29 1813 but it was more than a year before the legislative part of the terri torial government functioned The first act adopted under the new governorCasswas on the first day of October I814 Six acts were adopted in that year and nineteen during the following year and by this time it was too plain to admit denial that the existence of one hundred twenty statutes unprinted and of necessity gener ally unknown was a gross injustice to the people of the territory The legislative journal for this period cannot be found so that we are ignorant of the time and form of the resolution to publish these unprinted laws but in I816 there appeared a unique volume in statute publication It was printed in Detroit was entitled Some of the Acts of the Territory of Michigan with the Titles and a Digest of all of the acts of the said Territory now in force and con tained eight laws in full the titles only of eight laws and a digest of fiftysix more They were arranged alphabetically under the general subject treated of in the act The reason given for this extraordinary action is found in an unsigned note at the end of the volume stating that the funds at the disposition of the territorial government were not sufficient to print a complete copy of all the laws One title is An Act authorizing Aliens to hold lands in the Ter ritory of Michigan by purchase or otherwise without any further statement or explanation One of the digested acts reads An Act concerning the City of Detroit This Act provides for the incor poration of the City of Detroit and this is all the information furnished Under the title An Act concerning the Militia of the Territory 6i6GENERAL REVISION OF THE LAWS of Michigan it is said the original roll of this law has been lost and the only copy now to be found is so imperfect as to render it inexpedient to print it As an example of the digesting process the first section of the act concerning forcible entry and detainer as adopted read omit ting the enacting clause That no person or persons shall hereafter make any entry into any lands tenements or other possessions but in cases where entry is given by law and in such case not with strong hand nor with multitude of people but only in a peaceable and easy manner and if any person from henceforth do to the con trary and thereof be duly convicted he shall be punished by a fine The digested section reads Persons shall not make unlawful entry into lands nor lawful entry with force Some of the statutes digested or indicated by titles have never yet been printed in full By whom this statute digesting was done is not known but if the same method were used upon our later compiled statutes all our laws might be printed easily in one volume The book itself is of octavo size contains 144 pages and is extremely rare It is generally known as the Cass Code although that is as inappropriate a designation as in the case of the Wood ward Code The Ordinance of I787the constitution of the territorypro vided that the Governor and Judges should adopt and publish the laws It might have been a serious question whether the ordinary citizen who had no actual knowledge of the full letter of statutes as adopted would be bound by such a condensation as was published Such a publication obviously was not a credit either to the terri tory or to the United States which through Congress had general control of the territorial finances and conditions and on April 24 1820 an Act of Congress was approved authorizing the printing of the laws of the territory in force Under this law there was printed in Detroit the socalled Revised Statutes of I820 the title page reading Laws of the Territory of Michigan with marginal notes and an index to which are prefixed the ordinance and several acts of Congress relating to this territorypublished by authority I820 It actually was not printed until 1821 and contains statutes adopted as late as July 3 I82I On March 29 182I the Governor and Judges 617MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW passed an act that the edition of the statutes then printing be com pleted to the number of three hundred copies and handsomely and substantially bound This direction was followed and such copies few in number as still exist are well bound in strong wellfinished leather The volume contains one hundred and twentyone acts arranged without much regard to date of adoption or character of subject Of the laws printed one was adopted in 1805 one in i8io three in 1815 three in 1817 eighteen in I818 fifteen in I819 thirtynine in I82o and fortyone in 1821 Five laws adopted in 1817 I818 and 1821 and apparently in force were not included in the volume A general repealing act passed May 8 1821 excepted from its opera tion a number of statutes and several of these excepted statutes also were not included In evident preparation for this publication many laws were passed in 1820 and 1821 covering subjects of previous legislation and intended to replace them and in that sense the collection might be termed a revision This collection of laws met with general favor with the public and also the lawyers but when the first legislative council met in 1824 Governor Cass in his first message referred to some deficiencies in the Territorial Code which the council proceeded to correct Prior to this in the same year there was printed a small volume entitled Laws of the Territory of Michigan Compiled by the Legis lative Board in the year 1824 It contained 29 acts passed in 1821 1822 and 1823 and three resolutions At the second session of the first legislative council on April 21 1825 a resolution was adopted which provided for the printing of certain laws which were omitted from the I820 volume eleven in all also the Acts of Congress relating to Michigan passed in 1825 and the Executive Acts establishing county boundaries and fixing county seats and these were printed at Detroit in 1825 with the acts of the session At the same session resolutions were adopted reciting that it was highly important that the public acts of the territory be revised and a plain and simple code of laws formed acceptable to the people of the territory and calculated to promote their interest and protect their rights 6i8GENERAL REVISION OF THE LAWS The resolutions named five persons as a commission to revise the laws William Woodbridge then secretary of the territory received the smallest number of votes hut in the enrolled resolution was named first on the list followed by Abraham Edwards John Stock ton Wolcott Lawrence and William A Fletcher The commissioners were directed to revise consolidate and digest the laws making such alterations or additions as might be deemed expedient reporting the result to the legislative council at their next session which was due to be held in November 1826 Of this com mission three were members of the council Edwards Stockton and Lawrence only one of them Lawrence a lawyer but all men of good standing ability and experience Woodbridge was secretary of the territory an able and experienced lawyer Fletcher was a young man whol came to Detroit in I82I and two years later was appointed chief justice of the County Court of Wayne County Shortly after the session of 1826 was opened the resignation of William Woodbridge as member of the revision commission was presented to the council accepted and Asa M Robertson or Robin son a lawyer of Detroit was appointed in his place During the session various bills the result of the commissions work were presented and on December 27 I826 the commission presented their final report to the council In this report they stated that they had digested the different statutes and provisions relating to the same subject as far as practicable into a single statute In making alterations they had taken great care not to infringe upon longestablished principles and where legislation on new subjects was necessary they had supplied it Mr Lawrence one of the commission and also member of the council having the plain people in mind offered a resolution which was duly adopted providing that there be published with the laws a table or explanation in the English language of the names of writs and other process made use of in the statutes not expressed in proper English words Accordingly we find in the volume printed in 1827 preceding the index definitions or explanations of such words as bona fide defea zance certiorari venue and other words and phrases mainly of Latin origin frequently used in statutes or legal proceedings The result was a substantial wellprinted indexed and bound vol 6i9MICHIGAN LAW RGVIEWt ume of 709 pages with marginal notes the statutes relating to the same general subject grouped together in many cases only verbal changes or changes in arrangement and phrasing being made in others entire statutes were retained bodily without any change the whole making a much more complete and systematic collection of laws than had theretofore existed The sessions of the legislative council following 1827 were prolific in new laws and amendments of old ones so that in May 1832 a committee was appointed to inquire into the expediency of making a general revision of the laws This committee reported that there were but few copies of the laws remaining undistributed and it was inexpedient to republish them in their existing form that the many amendments of different laws should be condensed so that the acts on each subject would be entire and could be more readily and con veniently referred to The result was that the president of the council was authorized to appoint a committee to divide among the members of the council willing to perform the service the labor of condensing and collecting the statute laws of the territory At the next session in January I833 they reported this duly performed and found no difficulty in approving their own work which made considerable change in the laws and in the judicial system One advantage of this method of condensing and revising was that the council was thoroughly informed on all important changes in the laws One result of the condensation was that the volume contain ing all the laws in I833 had 87 fewer pages than the laws of 1827 There was however no order of arrangement so that the book was no improvement in that respect After the revision of 1833 there came each year a copious supply of new legislation and amendments to old laws The state consti tution of 1835 was adopted the legislature elected under the con stitution met in November of that year and enacted some laws As Michigan had not yet been received into the Union it was ques tioned whether the state existed and therefore whether any laws enacted by this legislature were valid The Supreme Court of the state in the case of Scott v Detroit Young Mens Society lessee decided in 184 held that Michigan became a state in 1835 by the adoption of its constitution regardless of its nonadmission into the Union and in consequence the acts of the legislature of I835 were 620GENERAL REVISION OF THE LAWS valid The Supreme Court of Ohio in the case of Myers v Man hattan Bank 20 Ohio 283 decided in 1852 involving the identical question held directly to the contrary However only one law of general naturefixing the salary of the governorwas passed at the first session owing probably to doubts of legality but at the adjourned session beginning in Feb ruary 1836 a considerable number were passed Governor Mason in his message at the opening of this session called attention to the need of properly organizing the judicial department of the new state and revising its laws He recommended the lopping off of useless branches and periodical revisions so that the laws might be under stood by others than those whose profession it was to interpret them Following this recommendation the legislature promptly passed an act which the governor approved March 8 1836 appointing Hon William A Fletcher a commissioner to prepare digest and arrange a code of laws for the state He was to have them ready for the legislature on the first Monday of January following and to receive not more than fifteen hundred dollars I500oo00 for his services Naturally enough this time proved insufficient the commissioner having judicial duties to perform first as circuit judge and later as chief justice of the Supreme Court and the time was extended to November 9 I837 An adjourned session of the legislature met at that date for the express purpose of acting on the report and sat until the last day of the year when the act was in part acted on and completed early in the following year This act was more than a revision or condensation it was an attempt really to codify the law of the state and the result was for the first time a unified treat ment of the entire subject with an entire recasting of language The work was divided into four parts treating respectively of the Internal Administration of the State Private Right Administration of Civil Justice and Administration of Criminal Justice The contrast in arrangement compared with the revisions of 1827 and 1833 was great In neither of them was there any attempt to do more than collect existing statutes upon any subject and put them together but without any particular order or logical connection still less was there any definite plan of arrangement of subjects The code or as the title page of the volume names it The Revised Statutes of Michigan made many changes from the terri 621MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW torial statutes The judicial system was made to consist of a Supreme Court with a chief justice and three associate justices a court of chancery with a chancellor four circuit courts a probate court and justice courts Return was made to the system of county government by three commissioners instead of supervisors The codifier for many years was a very prominent figure in the legal history of the state Born in New Hampshire he came to Detroit in 1821 at the age of thirtythree and impressed himself rapidly on the community as a man of force and ability In 1823 Governor Cass who early formed and always retained a high opin ion of his legal ability appointed him chief justice of the Wayne County Court and in 1825 appointed him attorney general of the territory In 1833 the county court system was abolished in the lower peninsula except for Wayne County and the rest of the penin sula was formed into one circuit and the governor appointed Fletcher the circuit judge The performance of his duties required him to hold yearly two terms at each county seat and as there were thir teen counties named in the act at which court should be held it can readily be seen that traveling alone would consume much time The law requiring that the judge after his appointment should reside within his district Judge Fletcher removed to Ann Arbor where he lived during the remainder of his life In March 1836 the state legislature passed a law providing for a Supreme Court consisting of a chief justice and associate judges and Governor Mason promptly appointed Fletcher the chief justice at a salary of sixteen hundred dollars I6oooo yearly and he continued to hold that position until he resigned in I842 He died at Annl Arbor in 1852 and for many years even the place of his burial was unknown In I916 the matter was called to the attention of the Michigan Bar Association and the Michigan Pioneer and Historical Society His remains were found inclosed in an iron casket disinterred and reinterred in a prominent location in the Ann Arbor Cemetery and a suitable monument will be erected The compensation for doing this important work was not to exceed fifteen hundred dollars 1500oo and later critics of the work intimated that Judge Fletcher did only a small part of the work and employed General Edward Clark a militia general living at Ann Arbor a man of good standing and ability but not of any 622GENERAL REVISION OF TiE LAWS legal training to do the main part and it is certain that in the code as presented there were important omissions which the succeeding legislatures were compelled to fill In December 1837 the legislature passed an act authorizing the governor to appoint two commissioners to superintend the publica tion of the revised laws and he appointed E B Harrington and E J Roberts Ebenezer Burke Harrington was a young lawyer who was at the time of his appointment living in Port Huron hut at once moved to Detroit to fulfill his part of this monotonous but important work He later reported the decisions of the Chancery Court of Michigan from I839 to 1844 and died in the latter year Elijah J Roberts a brilliant and versatile man was at this time thirtyseven years old Previous to coming to Detroit about I833 most of his life had been spent in New York as editor of various newspapers which vocation he occasionally followed in Michigan at times in combination with the practice of the law In the specu lative period of 18356 he went to St Clair where he speculated in village lots and promoted a railroad from St Clair to Romeo begin ning its construction He was later a justice of the peace in Detroit and took an active part in the militia rising to be colonel and in the Canadian Patriot War of 1837 was heartily in sympathy with the movement and took considerable part in recruiting and assisting the Patriots He was adjutant general of the state from 1842 to I844 and in 1845 was appointed assistant mineral agent for the upper peninsula While there he presented Chippewa County in the Con stitutional Convention of I850 was state senator from the upper peninsula in I85I but died April 29 of that year Serious omissions and deficiencies soon began to appear in the revision Being the work of one man who was much of the time actively engaged in other work it was perhaps unavoidably incom plete but it also made some radical changes which were not gener ally desired or understood For some years county affairs had been under the management of an elected board of supervisors The code changed this to a board of three commissioners Imprisonment for debt was continued although the governor and public sentiment were strongly opposed to it One great merit of the revision was that for the first time there was an orderly systematic arrangement of the subjects treated which brought into a connected whole all the statute law 623MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW The state grew rapidly in population each session of the legisla ture produced new laws and amendments to the revision and in I84I one thousand copies of the revision were ordered sold at two dollars no doubt in contemplation of another revision soon to be made When the legislature met in 1844 an act was passed March 2 amended March 12 1844 providing for the consolidation and revi sion of the general laws of the state The first act created a Council of Revision consisting of the chancellor the presiding judge of the first circuit and a commissioner to be appointed by the judges of the Supreme Court and the chancellor Immediately after that act was passed the legislature was advised that it was impossible for the chancellor and judge to devote the necessary time and attention to the work and therefore it amended the act so that the commissioner should perform the work The day following this action San ford M Green then a member of the state senate was appointed commissioner This was an excellent choice Judge Green had come to Michigan eight years before and had acted as justice of the peace and prosecuting attorney in Shiawassee County was judge of the Supreme Court from I848 to 1852 and from the latter year was circuit judge and as such also a member of the Supreme Court from I852 to I857 He later sat as circuit judge for several years The work of revising occupied Judge Green nearly two years He reported in January 1846 that he had devoted all his energies to the preparation and arrangement of the laws with such modifica tions amendments and additions as seemed best adapted to the peo ple of the state and calculated to secure their permanent happiness and prosperity In accordance with a resolution of the legislature the commis sioner prepared his revision and had it printed for the use of the legislature so that they had it before them as an entirety To the code as reported the legislature made numerous changes and additions it changed entirely the judicial system abolishing the Court of Chancery abolished capital punishment which had been retained by the reviser In the revision as reported and adopted the chapter on evidence was entirely rewritten and for the first time per mitted parties to suits to be witnesses There was present however in this revision one danger when 624GENERAL REVISION OF THE LAWl6S the law is put into a single statute it becomes very difficult for a body of men like the ordinary legislature to examine and compare the proposed code with the previously existing statutes minutely and thoroughly enough to have an intelligent understanding of all the changes made and their bearing upon the parts unchanged It thus follows that succeeding legislatures promptly claim that provisions of the code as adopted were not understood and should be amended Another objection to a single reviser which had been the case both in 1838 and 1846 was that in preparing a code of laws for the people of the state there should be more than one mind one view point used in the framing of the laws Four years later the Constitutional Convention of 1850 met and prepared a new constitution which was adopted the same year In it perhaps the most noticeable feature is the policy of restriction of the powers of the legislature no more internal improvements small fixed salaries for state officials biennial sessions of the legislature and many enactments which properly should be found only in statutes were inserted One provision was No general revision of the laws shall here after be made When a reprint thereof becomes necessary the legis lature in joint convention shall appoint a suitable person to collect together such acts and parts of acts as are in force and without alteration arrange them under appropriate heads and titles The first reference to this subject was on the fifteenth day of the convention when Mr Britain proposed as Section 39 of the article on Legislative Department The legislature may authorize a com pilation and reprint of the laws actually in force    but no revision or alteration of the laws shall at any time be authorized except    This brought the strong objection of Mr Williams the first pres ident of the Michigan Agricultural College Compilation and reprint he said was the plan out of which the last revision grew The reviser had proposed not to codify but compile the laws at a cost of five or six hundred dollars but it grew into a revision with the pay of the reviser several thousand dollars and the cost of print ing including cost of legislation 650000 The next day the subject came up again and was considerably discussed In the course of his argument Mr Britain said A revision of the laws should never be necessary except so far as may 625MICHIGAN LAW REViEW be necessary to adapt them to amendments of the constitution No man could draw up a code suited to all the various wants of the people Michigan had suffered three inflictions of this kind since his acquaintance and they were among the greatest calamities by which she had been visited the revision of I838 cost the state about 9oooooo The revised statutes of 1846 went from the hand of the reviser the reflection of his own peculiar views rather than those of the people A general murmur of disapproval ran through the state produced first by ignorance of the new laws second by their want of adaptation to the peoples wants and interests The matter was then passed and received no further discussion but later on Mr Britains motion the section as it now stands was adopted as Section eleven of the article Schedule and referred to the committee on Enrollment On the last day of the session this committee presented the entire constitution in its final form and had transferred this particular section to the article Miscel laneous where it appears as Section fifteen and so stands as adopted by the convention and voters In the proposed constitution of 1867 this provision was entirely omitted with no discussion In the Constitutional Convention of I907 the committee having the subject in charge proposed to omit the section but after a short discussion in which reference was made to former revisions the section with some slight changes was retained but placed in another article Judge Campbell always well informed and interested in the early history of the state referred at some length to the experience of Michigan in his opinion in the State Tax Law Cases 54 Mich 450 He said that Judge Fletcher instead of compiling the laws which was all the legislature intended prepared a new and what was meant to be a complete code whereby the law on several sub jects was essentially revolutionized and some important matters entirely overlooked Some of these defects were remedied before the Revised Status went into effect and before the session of January 1839 so many further omissions and defects were discov ered that much of the time of the legislature was spent in changing the code and supplying defects The revision of 1846 introduced some radical changes and superseded the great body of generallaws and was intended to be a complete code Subsequent legislatures 626GENERAL REVISION OF THE LAWS 627 also made numerous changes in this but there were not so many omissions In the convention of I850 the basis of objections to revisions and codifications was the mischief of allowing laws to be changed except by the sole action of the legislature which could not be applied with full intelligence to extended schemes which reflected the minds of others and could not be thoroughly compared and digested by the body of legislators so as to enable them to realize their full effect on the whole legal system of the state The result was the provision as adopted It is singular that the experience of no other state has produced a similar result Where other states have occasional revisions of the laws which tend to consolidate and omit contradiction and super fluous statutes Michigan is restricted to piecemeal treatment such as has been done in the Judicature Act and the Corporation revision now under consideration W L JENKS Port Huron Michigan

it does not pass upon the right to condemn though its award does not per se bind either party the owner may appeal to a duly constituted court where the award if affirmed is entered as a judgment against the city As in judicial proceedings it is appointed by a duly constituted court its proceedings are not ex parte and are legal in form an appeal is heard upon the pleadings proceed ings and

provides that lands acquired under the Act shall not become liable to the satisfaction of debts contracted prior to the issuing of the patent therefor Such lands are granted to the patentee in fee simple The defendant had obtained a judgment against the plaintiff in the state courts of Idaho after the issuance of the patent to the plaintiff upon indebtedness incurred prior to the issuance of the patent Held Holmes J dissent ing the statute is constitutional therefore a judgment lien on the land was invalid Ruddy v Rossi 1918 39 Sup Ct 46 The holding in the principal case has long been anticipated by state and lower federal courts Gile v Hallock 1873 33 Wis 523 Miller v Little 1874 47 Oal 348 Seymour v Sanders C 0 1874 21 Fed Cas No 12690 Nevertheless it involves conflicting principles of law The statute is a federal interference with the execution of a judgment of a state court upon land belonging at the time the judgment was rendered to a citizen of the state although on a cause of action accru ing when the land belonged to the United States In matters of municipal concern the power of the states is plenary and exclusive Cooper v Roberts 1855 59 U S 173 182

U S 45 31 Sup Ct 364 It is submitted that the Act in question is an instance of the exercise of such power and hence should be sustained CONTRACTSAGREEMNENT TO PROCURE GOVERNMIENT CONTRACTPUBLIC PoLIcYThe plaintiff agreed with the defendant uniform manufac turer to procure government contracts his compensation to be two per cent of the amount received by defendant from the government Held the contract was void as being in contravention of public policy Beck vr Bauman 1918 105 Misc 584 173 N Y Supp 772 It has been the policy of the courts to declare invalid contracts which involve or imply the resort to improper means in influencing governmental action Veazey v Allen 1903 173 N Y 359 66 N E 103 whether exercised by legislative bodies or administrative depart ments See Providence Tool Co v Norris 1864 69 U S 45 55 Hazelton v Sheckells 1905 202 U S 71 79 26 Sup Ct 567 Politi cal pressure and social solicitation are recognized as such improper means see Marshall v Baltimore  O Ry 1853 57 U S 314 and contracts for lobbying services have never been upheld Hyland v Oregon Hassam Paving Co 1914 74 Ore 1 144 Pac 1160 Crich field v Beermudez Asphalt Paving Co 1898 174 Ill 466 51 N E 552 On the other hand it is clear on theory and authority that agreements for legitimate professional services are valid So contracts have been upheld in which a plaintiff was to make bids to a city and use honest efforts for procuring street paving contracts for the de fendant company Durham v Hastings Paving Co 1900 56 App Div 244 67 N Y Supp 632 affd without opinion in 189 N Y 500 81 N E 1163 but cf Crichfield v Bermudez Asphalt Paving Co supra where an agents work was to draft a bill openly to explain it to a legislative committee and to ask to have it introduced Chese borough v Conover 1893 140 N Y 384 35 N E 633 and where a broker procured government contracts for a blanket manufacturer Winpenny v French 1869 18 Oh St 469 In none of these cases was personal influence required or intended and although where the compensation for the services are contingent upon success the infer ence may be strong that improper methods are to be attempted see Providence Tool Co v Norris supra such contracts are not neces sarily invalid Cf Faltz v Cogswell 1890 86 Cal 542 25 Pac 60 Cheesborough v Conover supra Durham v Hastings Paving Co supra Oscanyan v Winchester Arms Co 1880 103 U S 261 In the principal case it is however to be inferred that the work of the plaintiff was not solely to apprize the governmental department of the merits of the military equipment manufactured by the defendant but to bring influence personal or political to bear on the officials to secure the contract and his compensation being entirely contingent on the success of his services there is an added element pointing to the invalidity of the agreement The decision reached therefore is sound and especially so in view of the extraordinary conditions at the time which demanded a total absence of any sinister tampering with the activities of the government in its prosecution of the war 160

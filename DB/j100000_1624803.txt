Nematognaths have been considered by most ichthyologists to be most nearly related to the Ganoids or even associated with them in the same order Their entire structure however indicates that they are most nearly related to the Plectospondyls and they may even associate in the same superorder for which the name Ostariophysi of Sagenmehl may be adopted 1 On a Collection of Cephalopoda fromA the Albatross Expedition By WM E HOYLE Owens College Manchester England 6 On the Sarcostyles of the Plumularida By PROFESSOR C C NUTTING AM Iowa city Iowa The morphology of the Sarcostyles has been investigated by various writers from themiddle of the century to the present They are composed of ectoderm endoderm a according to most writers a solid axial rod A body cavity was described by one of the earliest writers and redescribed by the present writer The Sarcostyles are un doubtedly degraded persons of the hy droid colony The function of these structures is not well understood It appears to be partly defensive partly prehensile and partly of fensive The function of scavengers and digestive organs has also been ascribed to them 8 Notes on the Development of Drasteria erechtea By PROFESSOR F M WEBSTER Wooster Ohio The paper gives the results obtained from rearing larvae from the eggs to adults and shows the individual variation of each both in habit and appearance the latter being the object of the studies 9 Brood XVI of Cicada septendecim in Ohio By PROFESSOR F 1 WEBSTER Wooster Ohio The paper deals wwith the occurrence of Brood XVI of Cicada septendecim in Ohio in 1897 The area over which it has been observed is indicated the in fluence of natural enemies is discussedc and The probabilities of its becoming ex tinguished are explained 10 Notes on the Embryology of the Pig By DR CHARLES SEDGWICK MINOT Read ville Mass 1 The lypophysis there is a true infundibular gland which is homolo gous with the saccus vasculosus of Tele osts and is identical in form and connec tions with the embryonic saccus The duct of the gland becomes a solid stalk There is also a true hypophysis which develops a vestibule and glandtubes ho mologous with the same parts throughout the vertebrate series 2 The Cardinal Vein It is a striking peculiarity of transverse sections of pig embryos that in the region of the Wolffilan body no distinct vein appears correspond ing to the cardinal vein usually found on the dorsal side of the Wolffian body This is due to the fact that in the pig the cardi nal vein after entering the cephalic end of Wolffian body breaks into a multiplied sinus in which are lodged the Wolffian tubules Another peculiarity of the cardi nal vein is that it does join the jugular toSEPTEMBER 17 18971 SCIENCE 435 form the transverse Ductus buvieri but joins instead the great hepatic vein Ductus arantii not far from the heart 3 Allantoic IVilli The stalk of the Al lantois begins to form on its cephalad side within the abdomen a series of lobulated outgrowths which gradually increase until they occupy a relatively considerable space in the abdomen These villi consist of a cuboidal mesothelium covering a mass of matricial or ground substance in which are scattered a few cells of mesenchymal char acter The villi are beginning their devel opment in embryos of 140170 mm and are already reduced in embryo of 240 mm The author has no surmise to offer as to their function Nothing similar to them is known in other mammals 11 Harvard Embryological Collection By DR CHARLES SEDGWICK MINOT Read ville Mass The collection consists mainly of se ries of sections of vertebrate embryos It is expected ultimately to have repre sentatives of several divisions of the Mammalia and of the principle types of nonMammalian vertebrates The work of forming the collection is going forward with the following forms Man Necturus Dog Amia X Pig Amiurus Rabbit Batrachus Chick Acanthias Lacerta Torpedo Frog Petromyzon Amblystoma Amphyoxus The plan is to select for each form a care fuilly graduated series of stages and to make of each stage three complete series of sec tions in three planes the transverse the sagittal and the frontal or if the embryo is curved or twisted the three planes are chosen at right angles to one another A drawing of each stage is made A double catalogue is kept the first in book form is the entrycatalogue and records all details of preservation cutting staining and mounting The series of sections are num bered according to their order of entry The second catalogue is on cards which are arranged first according to species second under each species according to stage Every series of sections has a separate entry number and a separate card Every section is counted and the sections of every series numbpred At the present time there are about one hundred series completed The collection is intended primarily for investigators and is open to all competent investigators working in the Embryological Laboratory It is hoped that it will in crease during years to come in size and still more in usefulness So far as known to the writer it is the first collection of the kind to be started 12 Organic Selection By PROFESSOR H F OSBORN Columbia University and PROFESSOR E B POULTON Oxford Uni versity Duplicate title see No 25 14 Characters for Distinguishing the North American Species of Ceresa By Wm H ASHMEAD United States National Mu seum Washington D C An explanation of  the application of re cently discovered morphological characters to the classification of the Homopterous genus Ceresa The author points out the fact that many of the genera in the Mem bracidae are merely dimorphic forms of other genera 23 Reconstruction of Phenacodus primcevus the most Primitive Ungulate By PROFESSOR HENRY F OSBORN Columbia University New York This paper is accompanied by the re mounted skeleton of Phenacodus and a wax model executed by Charles Knight As orig inally mounted in Professor Copes labora tory the famous skeleton of Phenacodus pri436 SCIENCE N S VOL VI No 142 inmcvus conveyed a very imperfect impression of its actual form and proportions Several serious errors were committed by the re storer the most important of which was the implanting of two of the cervical vertebrme in the tail The author therefore consid ered it advisable to completely remount the animal and this has been done by Mr Adam Herman and Mr Martin of the American Museum at an expenditure of five months time The animal is placed as nearly as possible in a natural position It shows that the feet were not plantigrade or soled upon the ground but digitigrade as in the Tapir The body is characterized by the great con vexity of the back characteristic of the carnivore and of all early ungulates A further carnivorous feature is the great de velopment of the hind quarters and of the tail The disproportion between the hind and the forequarters is heightened by the extremely small size of the head containing a brain which was about the size of that of the opossum which has been fully de scribed by Cope 24 Homologies and Nomenclature of the Ele ments of the Molar Teeth By PROFESSOR HENRY F OSBORN Columbia University New York After a brief review of the tritubercular theory of Cope the writer spoke of his hypothesis advanced at the American Asso ciation meeting in 1891 that the multitu bercuilar teeth of the Multituberculata and Monotremata were also of tritubercular origin This hypothesis seems now to be confirmed by the teeth of Gomphodontia especiallv of the genus Diadermodon by Professor Seeley in the Narvo Beds of South Africa of Permian age The various Gomphodonts in these beds present molar teeth of more or less regular tritubercular pattern Related to them in skull structure is Tritylodona typical multituberculate This indicates that from the trituberculate Gomphodonts Tritylodon and other multituberculates may have taken their origin The paper was dis cussed by Professor Minot and Dr Gill 25 Modification and Variation and the Limits of Organic Selection By PROFESSOR HENRY F OSBORN Columbia University New York and PROFESSOR EDWARD B POULTON Oxford University England An account of these papers will be pub lished in a subsequent issue of SCIENCE 26 Geographical Distribution of the Golden Warblers By HARRY G OBERHOLSER Biological Survey United States Depart ment of Agriculture Washington D C The socalled Golden Warblers form a group of some twentyfive species and sub species in the genus Dendroica and are dis tributed over almost all the Nearctic region together with the Antillian Colombian and Central American subregions of the Neo tropical The greatest differentiation of forms occurs in the West Indies where the distribution of many of the species is some what

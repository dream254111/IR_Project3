consideration of Ridgways Color Standards and Nomenclature By WILLIAM LEON DAWSON W E HAVE ALL caught ourselves making pictures geometrical designs or graphs out of mental concepts Thought relations of all sorts tend to arrange themselves automatically into spatial groups Thus the days of the week to our minds are segments of a closed circle or steps of a ladder or links in a chain as the case may be If an eighth day were added to the week by statutory decree we should chop open our mental circle change the curve and insert the new segment or we should add another rung to our mental image of a ladder or add an eighth link to our chain But of all mental graphs I venture to say that our color schemes have been least perfectly organized least logical least related Following the analogy of the chart we have sometimes pictured color groups in two dimensions but the charts themselves remained dissociated unorganized arbitrary What may be the extent of Ridgways indebtedness to other color theorists I do not knowhe hints at such indebtedness in his pro loguebut so far as zoological colorworkers are concerned it remained for the orderly mind of Robert Ridgway to so present color relations that we may con ceive them in three dimensions to fix it indeed so that we must so conceive them To be sure the limitations of book making still necessitate the use of dissected charts serially presented But even with this handicap the sequence is so logi cal that we are able to reconstruct a mental cube or visualized colorfile having length breadth and thickness Colorfile is perhaps the best name for this new piece of mental furniture Let us conceive it as made up of prisms cubes of colored glass To understand its order therefore let us examine its first or facing wallthirtyseven cubes or columns of cubes wide and nine tiers or rows of cubes deep The central tier reading from left to right comprises the pure colors of the spectrum red orange yellow etc together with carefully selected intergrades orangered orange orangered redorange etcthirtysix colors to be known as hues with red repeated at the extreme right to give meaning to the violetred series The bottom tier of our wall is pure black the limit or asymptote of the suc cessively deepening shades produced by mixing the pure color of the central member of each column with increasing percentages of black The top tier of our wall is pure white the limit or asymptote of successively lightening tints of the central color produced by increasing dilutions of white In Ridgways scheme three steps are made in each direction so that we have seven colored tiers separating the black and the white boundary tiers So much is commonplace the next step is inspirationRidgways The third dimension of our color file is secured by progressive dilutions of neutral gray additions of a uniform amount in a given wall each block differing from its neighbors in the same wall in precisely the same degree in which the pure color blocks differ from their neighbors It is obvious that if progressive addi tions of gray differed only by one percent we should have one hundred walls bounded on the rear by a wall whose central tier was pure neutral gray and whose successive tints approached the top layer of pure white and whose suc cessive shades approached the bottom layer of pure black as in the first wall As a matter of convenience only five such progressively grayed intermediate walls are found necessary to cover for practical purposes the whole range212 THE CONDOR Vol XV The secret of this magic fortress is the value of neutral gray To parody Goethe Graiu ist eine ganz besondere Farbe Gray neutral is a tint of a very special kind It is the epitome or synthesis of all other colors in turn including that color positive and negative of color blackandwhite Its use precludes the necessity of an intimate acquaintance with color combinations You do not have to puzzle over a given color and say this is blue plus red plus green plus violet You have only to say this is blue plus so much or approximately so much neutral gray and you have it All this may be rice to the initiated but it is still caviar to the general Once you get the idea you cannot get away from the colorfile It has the ul timate authority of simplicity of logical sequence and of comprehensiveness One even ventures to hope that such a colorfile may one day be actualized in glass or blocks of painted wood as a recognized essential of the colorworkers ap paratus With such a device one might for instance by lifting off the top layer of white prisms survey all possible light tints at a glance or by lifting off the four top layers or whatever number you elect to have in your scheme view all the pure colors and all gray tones thereof at a glance This would be simplicity itself Meanwhile this mental or mnemonic colorfile will be found indispensable

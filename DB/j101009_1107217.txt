that where the owner of a theatre containing a possible means of exit which might or might not become a dangerous nuisance according to the manner in which the premises were used he was not re sponsible for injury sustained by a patron although the lessee was undoubtedly liable In the principal case it seems clear that the owner ought not to be held liable because he had leased a lake in its natural state and the lessee had been negligent in its use or management As the court remarks The owners are not to be re garded as the creators of the situation or authors of the wrong that resulted CorporationsDividendsPower of Stockholders to Declare and Rights ThereinIn Thiry v Banner Window Glass Co in the Su preme Court of Appeals of West Virginia October 1917 93 S E 958 the following is from the syllabus by the court While by  39 chapter 53 of the Code W Va of 1913  2872 the board of directors of a corporation is the only governing author ity authorized to declare dividends nevertheless where stockholders and directors by common consent concur in the management and control of the corporation such action of the stockholders in declar ing dividends the rights of creditors being in no way involved is not an invalid corporate act and the corporation is bound thereby Though a dividend so declared be at the time in excess of the actual net profits earned the rights of no creditor being involved and the corporation being solvent a stockholder cannot be denied his pro rata share of such dividend and in a action by him against the corporation therefor the supposed illegality of such corporate action is no defense nor is such stockholder estopped in such action by the fact that he has been paid and accepted sums in the aggre gate less than his pro rata share Where a stockholder has subscribed and paid for stock in a cor poration he cannot thereafter be deprived of his legal right to par ticipate pro rata in any dividend declared by the subsequent arbi trary action of directors or stockholders attempting to classify stockholders not provided for in his contract Criminal LawLiability of Party Incited by Official to Commit CrimeVhere officers of the law incite one to commit a crime and lure him on to its consummation the law will not authorize a ver dict of guilty against him according to the holding in Sam Yick v United StatesUnited States Circuit Court of Appeals Ninth Cir cuit March 19 1917240 Fed 60 The defendants were convicted under an indictment charging them with unlawfully conspiring to 5786 3 VIRGTNIA LAW REGISTER N S  Feb bring certain Chinamen into the United States from the Republic of Mexico The indictment set out certain alleged overt acts of one of the alleged conspirators consisting of the purchase of a railway ticket by him in pursuance of the conspiracy for his trans portation from Bakersfield to the City of San Diego and in further pursuance of the alleged conspiracy his leaving that city for the town of Tia Juana Mexico for the purpose of arranging to bring three Chinamen across the international boundary It appeared from the evidence introduced on the trial by the gov ernment that one Morse was its local inspector of immigration at Bakersfield during the times in question having gone there in that capacity about the first of January 1911 and that in the perform ance of his duties he had frequent occasion to see the defendant Sam Yickwhom he spoke of in his testimony as the principal China man in that vicinity in regard to Chinamen in and around Bakers field that on the 8th day of May 1911 he had a talk with Sam Yick in reference to smuggling Chinese into this county having gone to Yicks store to inquire about a Chinaman named Woo Jung Sing that Yick told him he knew the Chinaman and that he was on a ranch about five miles out of Bakersfield and that he would take the inspector out to see him as he wanted to have a talk with the latter anyway that Yick did so the afternoon of the same day The testimony further clearly tended to show an attempt by Sam Yick to bribe the inspector The indicment says the court alleges the conspiracy to lhave been entered into on the 24th day of August 1911 being the day on which Inspector Morse took Inspector Bernard to Yicks store and at which time Yick introduced to them the plaintiff in error Jung Kim as the man he was going to send down to guide the Chinamen from Mexico into this country If the testimiony thus given on behalf of the government was true a question of course for the determination of the jury the officers of the law instead of proceeding against the plaintiff in error Sam Yick for the attempted bribery of the inspector with the best of motives no doubt but wrongly as we conceive planned and induced himl to enter into a scheme with them by which the Chinamen referred lo in the in dictment should be brought into the United States and in the exe cution of which scheme so concocted they were according to the evidence so brought We see nothing in the testimony of Inspector Morse nor in any other evidence in the record tending to show that the idea of a conspiracy originated with Sam Yick Taking the testimony to be true the crime he committed was the attempted bribery of the gov ernment inspector to prepare false papers for the admission of Chi nese persons not entitled to enter the country and the scheme which culminated in the conspiracy alleged in the indictment to have been1918  NOTES OF CASES 787 formed on the 24th day of August 1911 by the plaintiffs in error and other persons to the grand jurors unknown was according to the evidence devised by the officers of the law and had its origin in the letter of Inspector Morse of date May 8 1911 to his superior officer And it was so contended in the court below on behalf of the plaintiffs in error and further that the plantiff in error Jung Kim was not a conspirator but a mere employee of Sam Yick in the transactions in question It is of course not a matter for this court to say what conclusion tle jury would or should have drawn from the testimony tending to show that the alleged conspiracy was first suggested by the offi cers of the law and tlat they lured the alleged conspirators on to commit the necessary overt act or acts and thus consumlnate the alleged crinme all of those matters being exclusively for the determi nation of the jury And while it may be true that the mere aiding of one in the commission of a criminal act by a government officer or agent does not preclude the conviction of the party conmmitting the crime yet where the officers of the law have incited the party to conmit the crimie charged and lured him on to its consummia tion the law will not authorize a verdict of guilty    In the recent case of Woo XVai v United States 223 Fed 412 137 C C A 604 we distinctly adiudged that it is against public to sustain a conviction for crime where the party or parties are in duced to conmmit it by officers of the government who thereafter ensnare and apprehend them in such commission In addition to the authorities there cited in support of that conclusion see also Taylor v United States 193 Fed

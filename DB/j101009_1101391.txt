taught at JSudgo B W home till he was fourteen years of age when he be Saunders came a pupil of the Bellevue High School of Bedford county which he attended for three sessions After spending the years 18771878 at home he devoted two sessions to work in the academic department of the University of Virginia During the session of 18801881 he was associated with Professor Frank P Brent in the conduct

Constitution of 1902 he became judge of the Seventh Circuit a position which he now worthily and most acceptably fills Judge Saundersl hfe has been a busy one abounding in useful ness to his state and people In the legislature he was first chair man of the Committee on Privileges and Elections and afterwards of the Committee on Courts of Justice rn 1899 he was elected Speaker of the House which position he retained till his election as judge1905 EDITORIAL 929 He was also the patron of many important statutes during his legislative career amongst which may be mentioned An act requiring

Saunders has received many evidences of the esteem and affection of those with whom he has been associated Amongst these testimonials was a silver service from his associates in the legislature when he was elected speaker in 1899 and another when he was elected judge in 1901 He was also presented with a hand some edition of the Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia and Atlas by the Lynchburg bar when he held the last term of his court in that city in January 1904 As a legislator Judge Saunders was as able zealous and untiring in opposing evil legislation as he was in advancing measures he believed to be for the good of his state whilst as a judge he is learned studious and impartial giving to every position taken in the argument of a cause the most careful and intelligent consid eration N C MANSON JR Much space in the present issue is devoted to McCues Case which during the past month has attracted wide attention among the members of the profession and has been the topic of extended dis The McCue cussion in the newspapers throughout the country In Case reporting the case we quote at length from the very Case able petition for a writ of error and publish in full the supplemental petition which is a strong but unique contribution to the literature of legal advocacy We likewise print in full the in930 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb structions given by the trial court They will be of value as pre cedents inasmuch as they have been declared to be sound by the couIt of last resort The vigorous opinion of the court shows that it was thoroughly convinced of the guilt of the prisoner and was determined to allow no finespun technicalities to save his neck The courts conclusion as to his guilt has been fully justified by his own confession made before he stepped upon the gallows The opinion however on some of the points raised does not seem to meet with the general approval of the bar We have before us the first annual report of the Board of the Virginia State Library for the year ending June 30 1904 The recent constitutional convention made the library a part of the Our State educational system of the state by putting it under the librarSa control of five directors appointed by the State Board of y Education The state library has hitherto been of little use in comparison with the modern progressive library but under the efficient management of the new board and the thoroughlv equipped librarian Mr John P Kennedy its usefulness has been greatly extended The librarians report to the board contains much matter of interest He gives an aecount of the formation of the library 18231830 and shows that the total amount expended in its maintenance has been 33424264 that the number of vol umes contained in the library is 43272 This is exclusive of the law library which contains 15623 volumes The report also shows that within one year 17000 readers have been served in the reading room The total number of books called for and consulted by these readers was 35000 It has been generally supposed that works of fiction are at the present day most popular but the report shows that less than 4000 works of fiction were served to the readers and that the demand for works of history is double that of fiction A most interesting account is given of the InterLibrary Loan Asso ciation by which the 125 Virginia libraries reporting to the state are granted the privilege of borrowing from each other and from the state library any book which may be needed for any special purpose Under a recent act of the General Assembly travelling libraries have been established and neat cases holding about fifty books are sent to various places throughout the state There are now five travel ling libraries The counties of Prince Edward Caroline North1905 EDITORIAL 931 umberland Chesterfield and Hanover are now enjoying them Applications have been received from many other counties This feature of the work will be greatly enlarged when the General As sembly provides an appropriation therefor The REGISTER has hitherto cited the Code of Virginia Annotated by Jno Garland Pollard as Va Code Anno Beginning with this issue the work will be cited Va Code 1904 This is done Citing the as a result of suggestions made by Professor Charles A New Code Graves of the University of Virginia and with the ap proval of the Supreme Court of Appeals which will hereafter adopt the citation referred to We hope that the West Publishing Company and the authors of the Virginia law books now in process of preparatioit will see fit to cite the work in the same manner Uniformity is most desirable The employers liability insurance business has grown to a most wonderful extent in the past few years Sixtytwo millions of dol lars have been paid in premiums on such insurance during the liability Insurance decade enditg with 1903 The premium rates ix Virginia are not based alone on the hazard of the em ployment but the rate varies in different states according to the attitude of the courts the juLries and the General Assemblv as to damage suits A careful study of the decisions of the courts of last resort in each state an examination of the statutes and the statistics collected as to average size of jury verdicts have enabled the companies after long experience to ascertain the cost of insurance in each juris diction We have not access to the rates obtaining in the various states but we are reliablv informed that Virginia rates indicate that neither the General Assembly the courts or the juries are upon the whole considered by the companies as unduly antagonistic to the defendant We recentlv heard a lawyer who has perhaps de fended as many damage suits as any lawyer in Virginia remark that while unjust verdicts were sometimes rendered especiallv against corporations yet in the aggregate the amount of the ver dicts would not exceed the amnount of damages unlawfully inflicted932 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb One of the marked tendencies of modern legislation is to hold the employer to stricter liability for personal injury or death suffered by employees in the course of their employment The Virginia Workmens Compen employers liability provision as contained sation Acts in the Constitution and in the Code 1904 is mere milk and water in comparison with the liability to which the master is held in many of the most enlightened states of the union and countries of the world In New York the rule concerning the assumption of risks by employees has been greatly abridged while in Colorado the fel lowservant defense has been completely abolished Connecticut in 1901 enacted a very brief but comprehensive statute as follows It shall be the duty of the master to exercise reasonable care to provide for his servant a reasonably safe place in which to work reasonably safe appliances and instrumentalities for his work and fit and competent per sons as his colaborers to exercise reasonable care in the appointment or designation of a viceprincipal and to appoint as such viceprincipal a fit and competent person The default of such viceprincipal in the perform ance of any duty imposed by law on the master shall be the default of the master In 1903 the legislature of Massachusetts appointed a commission to consider the relations between employer and employee Among the measures recommended by the commission was a bill which seems radical indeed in comparison with Virginia legislation The bill referred to is almost identical with the Workmans Compensa tion Act of Great Britain It provides for compensation to the employee for every personal injurv arising out of or in the course of the employment whether the employer is chargeable with negli gence or not Germany Austria Norway Denmark Spain Italy and Finland have similar laws They are founded upon the theory that work which consumes liuman lives should pay for them not as a penaltyv for negligence but as compensation for material used the price of which is to be paid by the consumer In order to recover under the proposed Mfassachusetts act the workman must be disabled at least two weeks The amount of compensation to be recovered is fixed by a scale in which the principal items are these A sum equal to three years earnings if the injuries are fatal payable to those dependent upon the deceased medical and burial expenses if no dependents1905 EDITORIAL 933 are left for 1isabling injuries half wages during disability if dis ability proves to be permanent compensation may be commuted in one sum in the manner prescribed by the act The feature of the law is that compensation for injuries becomes in substance a part of the contract of employment and is payable for accidental injuries for which the employer can not be held liable under the law of negligence nor underthe employers liability acts Where the employer is guilty of gross negligence the employee may re cover upon his legal rights regardless of the proposed statuteTHEIE

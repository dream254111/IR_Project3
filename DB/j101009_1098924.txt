quence of their failure as common carriers to transmit with due care certain strawberries intrusted to them for the Philadelphia and Boston markets It is a well established common law rule that in all actions of con tract the plaintiff must prove his contract against as many persons as he alleged it and he must recover against all or none This principle has been modified by statute Code sec 3395 We are not how ever called upon to decide whether or not the case at bar comes with in the provision of the statute as the parties have taken it from under the operation of the common law by the following agreement The court certifies that the foregoing evidence which is hereby made a part of bill of exceptions is all that was introduced upon the trial of this cause And the court further certifies that after the jury had retired they returned into court and the foreman asked the court whether the jury could find against one of the defendants and not against the other that before the judge had responded to said enquiry one of the counsel who was engaged in the trialall the counsel for all parties being then presentstated that by agreement of counsel that they could find either against both or one of the defendants or against the plaintiff and thereupon the judge stated to the jury that by consent of counselfor all parties they could find against both or either defen dant or against the plaintiff After the jury were informed of this agreement of counsel they brought in a verdict in the following words  We the jury find for the plaintiff against the New York Philadelphia  Norfolk Railroad Company and assess his damages against said defendant at 81664 And we find for the defendant the California Fruit Transportation Company The court refused to set this verdict aside and gave judgment in accordance therewith While insisting that neither is liable the plaintiff in error relies chiefly upon the contention that as between itself and the California Fruit Transportation Company the latter is liable The judgment in favor of the California Fruit Transportation Company has been allowed to pass unchallenged No writ of error has been asked for or obtained to the judgment in its favor The plaintiff in error having agreed that the jury might find against either defendant and the California Fruit Transportation Company not being a party before this court we are not at liberty to enter upon a consideration of the controversy as to which of the two defendants is primarily liable The only question presented by the record before us is as to the 1900 956 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER liability of the plaintiff in error to the defendant in error In other words would the plaintiff in the court below have been entitled to the judgment complained of if the plaintiff in error had been sued alone The California Fruit Transportation Company is an Illinois corpora tion that furnishes what is known as refrigerator cars These cars are constructed with ice tanks holding several tons of ice and are specially used in the transportation of fruits vegetables and other perishable articles The plaintiff in error doubtless in order that it might compete with other railroads similarly equipped employed these re frigerator cars for the use of shippers of perishable freight over its line The strawberries in question were delivered to and put in two of these refrigerator cars which were then transferred to the road of the plaintiff in error where they were formed a part of its train As the strawberries were delivered to the refrigerator cars the receipt of that company would be given for the number of crates delivered each re ceipt showing on its face that the consignment was subject to the con ditions of the railroad companys bill of lading There was no bill of lading except that given by the plaintiff in error and all the freight charges including the extra charge for the use of the refrigerator cars were paid to the plaintiff in error It was necessary that these cars should be properly refrigerated and kept in that condition until the fruit reached its destination and it clearly appears that the dam age sustained by the defendant in error resulted from a failure to per form that duty In the case of the Pennsylvania Co v Roy 102 U S 451 a pas senger occupying a Pullman car was injured by a berth falling and striking him on the head He instituted suit against the railroad company and recovered judgment for 10000 for the injuries sus tained The defence relied on was that the sleeping car in which the accident occurred was owned by the Pullman Palace Car Company a corporation of the State of Illinois that holders of railroad tickets were entitled to ride in said sleeping cars provided they also held sleeping car tickets that the Pullman Pailace Car Company and it only is sued tickets for sale entitling passengers to ride in its sleeping cars and that such tickets were sold at offices established by the Pullman Car Company that the Pullman Car Company employed persons to take charge of its cars and the latter whilst in use were in the im mediate charge of a conductor and a porter employed by that com pany and that such conductor and porter were the only persons who had authority to manage and control the interior of said cars and the 96 JuneNEW YORK ETC R CO V CROMWELL berths and seats and appurtenances thereto The lower court in structed as part of the law of the case that if the car in which the accident occurred composed a part of the train in which the plaintiff and other passengers were to be transported upon their journey and the plaintiff was injured while in that car without any fault of his own and by reason either of the defective construction of the car or by some negligence on the part of those having charge of the car then the defendant was liable This view of the law was upheld by the Supreme Court Justice Harlan saying in part As between the parties now before us it is not material that the sleepingcar in question was owned by the Pullman Palace Car Coin pany or that such company provided at its own expense a conductor and porter for such car to whom was committed the immediate control of its interior arrangements The duty of the railroad company was to convey the passenger over its line In performing that duty it could not consistently with the law and the obligations arising out of the nature of its business use cars or vehicles whose inadequacy or in sufficiency for safe conveyance was discoverable upon the most care ful and thorough examination If it chose to make no such examina tion or to cause it to be made if it elected to reserve or exercise no such control or right of inspection from time to time of the sleeping cars which it used in conveying passengers as it should exercise over its own carsit was chargeable with negligence or failure of duty The law will conclusively presume that the conductor and porter as signed by the Pullman Palace Car Company to the control of the in terior arrangements of the sleepingcar in which Roy was riding when injured exercised such control with the assent of the railroad com pany For the purposes of the contract under which the railroad company undertook to carry Roy over its line and in view of its ob ligation to use only cars that were adequate for safe conveyance the sleepingcar company its conductor and porter were in law the ser vants and employees of the railroad company Their negligence or the negligence of either of them as to any matters involving the safety or security of passengers while being conveyed was the negligence of the railroad company The law will not permit a railroad company engaged in the business of carrying persons for hire through any de vice or arrangement with a sleepingcar companywhose cars are used by the railroad company and constitute a part of its train to evade the duty of providing proper means for the safe conveyance of those whom it has agreed to convey 1900 976 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Recognizing the higher duty due by common carriers to passengers we are of opinion that the principles announced by the Supreme Court in this case are applicable to the case at bar The employment of a common carrier whether it be to carry passengers or freight is a pub lic employment and the duty he owes as such is a public duty calling for the exercise of a high degree of care which should not be lightly or negligently performed The California Fruit Transportation Company for a consideration furnished its cars to the plaintiff in error These cars were agencies or means employed by the plaintiff in error for carrying on its busi ness and performing its duty to the public as a common carrier one of which was to provide suitable cars for the safe and expeditious carriage and preservation of the freight it undertook to carry A railway company cannot escape responsibility for its failure to provide cars reasonably fit for the conveyance of the particular class of goods it undertakes to carry by alleging that the cars used for the purposes of its own transit were the property of another The undertaking of the plaintiff in error was to properly care for and safely carry the fruit of the defendant in error and it is immaterial that the cars in which they were carried were owned by the California Fruit Transportation Company or that such company undertook to ice said cars or to pay for the ice As between the plaintiff in error and defendant in error the California Fruit Transportation Company and its employees were the agents of the plaintiff in error So far as the defendant in error was concerned the plaintiff in error was under the same obligations to care for the fruit that it would have been had the refrigerator cars be longed to it For these reasons the judgment is affirmed Affirmed NOTEThe main point decided in the foregoing case namely that a common carrier cannot rid itself of liability for injury to passengers or goods transported due to improper condition of appliances used by it in carrying out its contract of transportation by proof that such appliances belonged to another company is fun damental in the law of common carriers The refusal of the court to consider the question of liability as between the iailroad company and the refrigerating com pany was fully justified by the fact that the refrigerating company was not made a party to the appeal 98 June

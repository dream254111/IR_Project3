ERROR WAS TO PROPERLY CARE FOR AND SAFELY CARRY THE FRUIT OF THE DEFENDANT IN ERROR AND IT IS IMMATERIAL THAT THE CARS IN WHICH THEY WERE CARRIED WERE OWNED BY THE CALIFORNIA FRUIT TRANSPORTATION COMPANY OR THAT SUCH COMPANY UNDERTOOK TO ICE SAID CARS OR TO PAY FOR THE ICE AS BETWEEN THE PLAINTIFF IN ERROR AND DEFENDANT IN ERROR THE CALIFORNIA FRUIT TRANSPORTATION COMPANY AND ITS EMPLOYEES WERE THE AGENTS OF THE PLAINTIFF IN ERROR SO FAR AS THE DEFENDANT IN ERROR WAS CONCERNED THE PLAINTIFF IN ERROR WAS UNDER THE SAME OBLIGATIONS TO CARE FOR THE FRUIT THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD THE REFRIGERATOR CARS BE LONGED TO IT FOR THESE REASONS THE JUDGMENT IS AFFIRMED AFFIRMED NOTETHE MAIN POINT DECIDED IN THE FOREGOING CASE NAMELY THAT A COMMON CARRIER CANNOT RID ITSELF OF LIABILITY FOR INJURY TO PASSENGERS OR GOODS TRANSPORTED DUE TO IMPROPER CONDITION OF APPLIANCES USED BY IT IN CARRYING OUT ITS CONTRACT OF TRANSPORTATION BY PROOF THAT SUCH APPLIANCES BELONGED TO ANOTHER COMPANY IS FUN DAMENTAL IN THE LAW OF COMMON CARRIERS THE REFUSAL OF THE COURT TO CONSIDER THE QUESTION OF LIABILITY AS BETWEEN THE IAILROAD COMPANY AND THE REFRIGERATING COM PANY WAS FULLY JUSTIFIED BY THE FACT THAT THE REFRIGERATING COMPANY WAS NOT MADE A PARTY TO THE APPEAL 98 JUNE

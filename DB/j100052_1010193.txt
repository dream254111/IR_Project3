PROBLEMS CHARITY ORGANIZATION SOCIETY OF NEW YORKTHE RECENT REPORT OF THE NEW YORK CHARITY ORGANIZATION SOCIETY IS A MOST INSTRUCTIVE DISCUSSION OF THE AGENCIES REMEDIAL PREVENTIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE FOR THE BENEFIT OF SUF FERING HUMANITY IT IS A GENERAL SURVEY OF THE WHOLE FIELD OF PHILANTHROPIC ACTIVITY IN NEW YORK TO QUOTE FROM THE REPORT EVERY YEAR INCREASINGLY THE GREAT CHARITABLE REFORMATORY AND PREVENTIVE SOCIAL AGENCIES ARE COMING TO REGARD THEMSELVES AS INTEGRAL PARTS OF ONE WHOLE AND ARE WORKING WITH LESS OF WASTEFUL RIVALRY AND LESS OF WASTEFUL REPETITION OF THE MISTAKES OF OTHERS TOWARDS ONE COMMON END IN THE DIVISION OF WORK AMONG THEMSELVES IN THE PROMOTION OF NEEDED REFORMS IN THE DEFEAT OF ILLCONSIDERED AND INJURIOUS SCHEMES OF LEGISLATION IN AN INTERCHANGE OF EXPERIENCE IN MUTUAL UNDER STANDING OF THE PRECISE OBJECTS AND METHODS OF EACH THERE HAS BEEN EXTRAORDI NARY PROGRESS THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT SPECIFIC MOVEMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN SET ON FOOT BY THE SOCIETY ARE PERHAPS THE TENEMENT HOUSE COMMITTEE ON WHOSE INITIATIVE THE RECENT ADVANCED LEGISLATION ON THIS SUBJECT AND THE CREATION OF THE TENEMENT HOUSE DEPARTMENT IN THE MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT WERE SECURED AND THE COMMITTEE ON THE PREVENTION OF TUBERCULOSIS WHICH HAS ENLISTED THE HEARTY SUPPORT OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION AMONG THE NOTABLE EVENTS OF THE PAST YEAR HAVE BEEN THE ERECTION OF NEW AND MUCHNEEDED BUILDINGS AT CITY HOSPITAL ON BLACKWELLS ISLAND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF COTTAGES FOR AGED COUPLES IN THE FARM COLONY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC CHARITIES ON STATEN ISLAND THE OPENING OF DISPENSARIES AT BELLEVUE AND ALLIED HOSPITALS AND BY THE BOARD OF HEALTH FOR THE CARE OF CONSUMPTIVES LIVING AT HOME LEGISLATION FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A PSYCHO PATHIC HOSPITAL UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE STATE COMMISSION IN LUNACY THE AWARDING OF CONTRACTS FOR THE NEW HARLEM AND FORDHAM HOSPITALS AND A NEW WING AT GOUVERNEUR HOSPITAL AND THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF PLANS FOR A NEW BELLEVUE HOSPITAL THE INAUGURATION OF A MOVEMENT FOR THE REMOVAL OF THE HOUSE OF REFUGE FROM RANDALLS ISLAND TO A NEW SITE IN THE COUNTRY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A REFORMATORY FOR YOUNG PRISONERS ON HARTS ISLAND IN THE CARE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTION ALL OF THESE AND MANY OTHER CHANGES IN THE WORK OF THE CITY DEPARTMENTSMAINLY FOR THE BETTERHAVE BEEN FULLY DESCRIBED AS THEY HAVE OCCURRED IN THE PAGES OF CHARITIES THE TRANSFORMA TION OF THE HUDSON REFORMATORY INTO AN INSTITUTION FOR GIRLS THE BETTER CLASSIFICATION OF THE INMATES OF THE REFORMATORIES FOR WOMEN AND THE CHANGE BY WHICH GIRLS ARE NO LONGER TO BE SENT TO THE HOUSE OF REFUGE OR TO THE STATE INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL AT ROCHESTER WITH THE PENDING REMOVAL OF THE TWO LATTER INSTITUTIONS TO NEW AND MORE APPROPRIATE SITES CONSTITUTE ON THE WHOLE A SATISFACTORY ADVANCE IN THE REFORMATORY SYSTEM OF THE STATE I89THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY THE SOCIETY HAS TAKEN AN ACTIVE PART IN THE MOVEMENT FOR NEW PARKS AND PLAYGROUNDS STRONG REPRESENTATIONS WERE MADE TO THE BOARD OF ESTI MATE AND APPORTIONMENT IN FAVOR OF THE CONDEMNATION OF THE SOCALLED LUNGBLOCK BUT OWING APPARENTLY TO THE OPPOSITION CHIEFLY OF A LOCAL POLI TICIAN AND A LOCAL PARISH PRIEST WHO FEARED THE LOSS OF CONSTITUENTS AND PARISHIONERS THIS PLAN WAS AT LEAST TEMPORARILY DEFEATED THE SOCIETY ALSO TOOK PART IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE CITIZENS RELIEF COMMITTEE IN CON NECTION WITH THE GENERAL SLOCUM DISASTER THE SOCIETYS ENTHUSIASM OVER THE GIFT OF MR JOHN T KENNEDY FOR THE PERMANENT ENDOWMENT OF THE SCHOOL OF PHILANTHROPY IS NATURAL AND COMMENDABLE CONSIDERING THAT IT ENSURES THE ENLARGEMENT AND PERPETUATING OF THE SCHOOL NOR IS THE SOCIETY ANY LESS JUSTIFIED IN ITS EXPLOITATION OF CHARITIES THE EXCELLENT MONTHLY REVIEW OF LOCAL AND WORLDWIDE PHILANTHROPY WHICH IS PUBLISHED UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE SOCIETY THE SOCIETY HAS PERFORMED A PUBLIC SERVICE IN CALLING ATTENTION TO THE DEPLORABLE EFFECT OF POLITICAL DOMINATION OVER THE MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENTS IN WHICH HUMAN LIFE IS CONCERNED THE STATEMENT WAS EVIDENTLY PREPARED WITH CONSIDERABLE RESTRAINT OWING TO THE DIFFICULTY OF SAYING UNPLEASANT THINGS WITHOUT GIVING PERSONAL OFFENCE TO QUOTE FROM THE REPORT IT IS HOWEVER A CLEAR DUTY TO CALL ATTENTION TO THE WASTEFULNESS THE INJURY TO THE INTERESTS OF THE SICK AND DEPENDENT AND THE INEXCUSABLE FOLLY OF ATTACHING THE RESPONSI BLE ADMINISTRATION OF SUCH A DEPARTMENT FOR EXAMPLE AS THAT OF THE DEPART MENT OF PUBLIC CHARITIES TO THE FLUCTUATIONS OF MUNICIPAL CAMPAIGNS  NO BETTER ILLUSTRATION OF THE ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLE THAT THE GREAT CITY OF NEW YORK IS ENTITLED TO THE SERVICE OF EXPERTS AND THE CONTINUED SERVICE OF SUCH EXPERTS AS HAVE SHOWN MARKED FITNESS FOR GREAT RESPONSIBILITIES CAN BE GIVEN THAN BY A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE ADVANCES MADE IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC CHARITIES IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE PRESENT YEAR AND THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR I903 AND THE YEAR I902 IN BOTH OF THE PRECEDING YEARS NEW INSTITUTIONS WERE CREATED OLD INSTITUTIONS WERE REORGANIZED UPON A BETTER BASIS AND ADMINISTRATIVE REFORMS OF VARIOUS KINDS WERE MADE SOME OF WHICH ARE MENTIONED IN OTHER PARTS OF THE PRESENT REPORT BUT ALL OF WHICH ARE SET FORTH IN DETAIL IN THE OFFICIAL QUARTERLY REPORTS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC CHARITIES STILL MORE STRIKING WILL BE A CONSERVATIVE FORECAST OF SOME OF THE THINGS WHICH UNDOUBTEDLY WOULD HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED IN THIS FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR I904 IF THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE FORMER COMMISSIONER OF CHARITIES HAD BEEN CONTINUED AND HAD BEEN GIVEN THE SAME SUPPORT AS WAS ACCORDED IT DURING THE PREVIOUS TWO YEARS IT IS SAFE TO SAY THAT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN EXPENDED UNDER PENDING OR COMPLETED CONTRACTS AT LEAST HALF A MILLION DOLLARS FOR NEW BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS AMONG WHICH WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN SIX ADDITIONAL COTTAGES FOR AGED INFIRM PERSONS ON STATEN ISLAND AN ADEQUATE DORMITORY FOR EMPLOYEES IN THE METROPOLITAN HOSPITAL WHO ARE NOW LODGED IN AN INCREDIBLY UNSUITABLE MANNER AN ISOLATION PAVILION ON RANDALLS ISLAND FOR CHILDREN SUFFERING FROM VENEREAL DISEASES OF WHOM THERE ARE UNFORTUNATELY A GREAT NUMBER A NEW EMERGENCY HOSPITAL AT CONEY ISLAND WHICH MIGHT SERVE ALSO AS A CONVALESCENT HOSPITAL FOR THE USE OF THE I90PHILANTHROPY CHARITIES AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS ENTIRE DEPARTMENT AND A HOSPITAL FOR NERVOUS DISEASES ON BLACKWELLS ISLAND THE LATTER WOULD NOT NECESSARILY REQUIRE A NEW BUILDING BUT WOULD GATHER INTO A GROUP OF BUILDINGS ALREADY EXISTING THE SIX HUNDRED PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM PARALYSIS AND OTHER NERVOUS DISEASES GIVING THEM THE GREAT BENEFIT OF A SPECIAL STAFF OF PHYSICIANS EXPERT IN THE TREATMENT OF SUCH DISEASES AND WITH SPECIAL EQUIPMENT THEREFOR UNDOUBTEDLY THE NURSING IN THE WARDS FOR SICK CHILDREN ON RANDALLS ISLAND WOULD HAVE BEEN DEFINITELY ORGANIZED AS PART OF A TRAINING SCHOOL FOR NURSES MALE CONSUMPTIVES WOULD HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THEIR PRESENT UNSUITABLE QUARTERS IN KINGS COUNTY HOSPITAL A CAMP FOR CONVALESCENT CONSUMPTIVES ESTABLISHED AT THE CITY FARM COLONY ON STATEN ISLAND AND WOMEN WOULD HAVE BEEN ADMITTED AS DAY PATIENTS WITH PROPER DISPENSARY TREATMENT TO THE TUBERCULOSIS INFIRMARY ON BLACKWELLS ISLAND AND THE VIGOROUS PROSECUTION OF DESERTING FATHERS AND HUSBANDS WHO HAVE ABSCONDED FROM THE STATE LEAVING THEIR FAMILIES DEPENDENT WOULD HAVE BEEN INAUGURATED THESE MEASURES ARE ENUMERATED NOT AS BASELESS SPECULATIONS BUT AS DEFINITE PLANS MANY OF WHICH WERE WELL UNDER WAY ON THE FIRST DAY OF JANUARY FOR EXAMPLE THE HOSPITAL FOR NERVOUS DISEASES WHICH HAD BEEN RECOMMENDED AND FOR WHICH THE PLANS HAD TO SOME EXTENT BEEN WORKED OUT BY DR FREDERICK PATERSON AND DR PEARCE BAILY TWO OF THE FOREMOST SPECIALISTS HAD BEEN MADE THE SUBJECT OF FULL INVESTIGATION REPORTS HAD BEEN RECEIVED FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE HOME FOR THE AGED AND INFIRM AND OTHER PREPARATORY STEPS TAKEN WITH A VIEW TO ACTION EARLY THIS YEAR IT IS AS EXTRAORDINARY AS IT IS HUMILIATING THAT OF THESE VARIOUS PLANS FOR MORE EFFICIENT AND MORE HUMANE CARE OF THE CITYS DEPENDENTS NOT ONE HAS BEEN CARRIED INTO EFFECT OR ADVANCED BEYOND THE STAGE AT WHICH IT WAS LEFT ON NEW YEARS DAY AND THAT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE SELECTION OF A SITE FOR A MUNICIPAL LODGING HOUSE NO NEW PLANS HAVE BEEN SUBSTITUTED FOR THEM SO FAR AS CAN BE ASCERTAINED FROM AN EXAMINATION OF THE OFFICIAL REPORTS AND PERSONAL INQUIRY AT THE DEPARTMENT THE CONSIDERATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN URGED WITH REFERENCE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC CHARITIES WOULD APPLY WITH ALMOST OR QUITE EQUAL FORCE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTION THE TENEMENT HOUSE DEPARTMENT AND THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT PERMANENCY OF TENURE FOR SUCH AS ARE FOUND TO HAVE PECULIAR QUALIFICATIONS FOR THOSE RESPONSIBLE AND ESSENTIALLY NON PARTISAN FUNCTIONS OF THE MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT IS A PRINCIPLE WHICH EVERY GOOD CITIZEN WHATEVER HIS POLITICS SHOULD HEARTILY AND UNEQUIVOCALLY ACCEPT THE NOTE OF THIS PART OF THE REPORT IS ONE OF DESPAIR RATHER THAN ANGER IN THE EFFORT TO MAINTAIN FRIENDLY TERMS WITH THE ADVERSARY DR DEVINE HAS SUPPRESSED HIS NATURAL FEELINGS IT IS HOWEVER CLEAR TO THOSE WHO CAN READ BETWEEN THE LINES OF HIS STATEMENT THAT THE CHARITY ORGANIZATION SOCIETY MAINTAINS ITS CALM EXTERIOR WITH WEARINESS AND PAIN AND THAT ITS MEASURED WORDS ARE REALLY GIVING IT GREAT DISTRESS THE SOCIETY SUMMARIZES ITS POSITION THUS THE FIVE SPECIAL FEATURES OF THE WORK OF THE CHARITY ORGANIZATION SOCIETY ALL OF WHICH ARE UNIQUE AND DISTINCTIVE OF THIS SOCIETY INDICATE ITS PECULIAR AND CENTRAL POSITION AMONG THE CHARITABLE AGENCIES OF THE CITY NO OTHER SOCIETY UNDERTAKES OR COULD I9ITHE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY UNDERTAKE WITHOUT SACRIFICING ITS OWN AND PERHAPS EQUALLY INDISPENSABLE FUNCTIONS THE SPECIAL OBJECTS AND ACTIVITIES OF THIS SOCIETY IT IS A SOCIETY FOR ORGANIZING AND COORDINATING CHARITABLE WORK IT IS A SOCIETY FOR RECEIVING APPLICATIONS FOR AID CAREFULLY SIFTING AND TESTING THEM AND OBTAINING FROM THE PROPER SOURCES PROMPT AND ADEQUATE MATERIAL RELIEF FOR SUCH AS ARE IN NEED IT IS A SOCIETY FOR ENCOURAGING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW AGENCIES WHERE THEY ARE REQUIRED FOR GIVING EXPERT AND CONFIDENTIAL ADVICE TO THE BENEVOLENT IN THEIR BENEFACTIONS FOR GIVING ACCURATE INFORMATION IN REGARD TO CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS ALMONERS OR AGENTS THAT APPEAL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS IT IS A SOCIETY FOR HELPING THE POOR THROUGH WISE COUNSEL BASED UPON LONG AND INSTRUCTIVE EXPERIENCE THROUGH PERSONAL SERVICE OF VOLUNTEER VISITORS AND THROUGH ALL SUCH MEANS AS WILL MAKE THEM AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE MOMENT SELFSUPPORTING AND SELFRESPECTING MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY THE REPORT IS SIGNED BY ROBERT W DE FOREST PRESIDENT AND EDWARD T DEVINE GENERAL SECRETARY THE NEWARK BUREAU OF ASSOCIATED CHARITIESTHE HISTORY OF THE BUREAU OF ASSOCIATED CHARITIES OF NEWARK N J IS TYPICAL OF THE DEVELOP MENT OF THE CHARITY ORGANIZATION MOVEMENT IN OTHER CITIES THE SOCIETY IS NOW TWENTYONE YEARS OLD HAVING BEEN ORGANIZED AT THE SAME TIME WITH THE GENERAL MOVEMENT TOWARD INQUIRY AND INVESTIGATION OF METHODS OF CHARITY WHICH TOOK PLACE IN THE LATER SEVENTIES AND THE EARLY EIGHTIES IT ADOPTED FOR ITS CONSTITUTION PRACTICALLY THAT OF THE BOSTON ASSOCIATED CHARITIES INCLUDING THE SYSTEM OF DISTRICT OFFICES WITH PAID SUPERINTENDENTS THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE NEW IDEAS CARRIED THE WORK ON VITALLY AND SUCCESSFULLY FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS WHEN IT APPARENTLY BEGAN TO LAG THE VITAL PRINCIPLES OF CHARITY ORGANIZATION WERE NOT EASY TO WORK OUT IN A CONSTRUCTIVE WAY AND THE SOCIETY BEGAN GRADUALLY TO LESSEN ITS ACTIVITIES AND TO NARROW ITS WORK AND IDEALS FINALLY IT MAY BE STATED AS APPROXIMATELY TRUE THE SOCIETYS WORK BECAME LARGELY THE WORK OF INVESTIGATION AND REPORT THE ACTIVE WORK BEING DELEGATED TO OTHER SOCIETIES FURTHERMORE THE FIELD OF EFFORT SEEMED TO NARROW DOWN TO THE MATTER OF AFFORDING MATERIAL RELIEF AND THE BUREAUS INVESTIGATION WAS TO FIND WHETHER THE FAMILY WAS WORTHY OR UNWORTHY OF MATERIAL RELIEF COINCIDENT WITH THE DECREASE OF VITALITY CAME THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE DIS TRICTS INTO THE CENTRAL OFFICE THE DISTRICT OFFICES BEING GIVEN UP TO SAVE EXPENSE WITHIN THE PAST TWO YEARS THE SOCIETY HAS UNDERGONE A CHANGE IT IS RECOGNIZING MORE AND MORE THE BROADER PHASES OF CHARITABLE WORK INVOLVING QUESTIONS AS TO THE SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS OF THE FAMILIES DEALT WITH AT THE SAME TIME THERE HAS COME A RENEWED INTEREST IN THE PERSONAL WORK OF REGENERATING THE CHARACTER OF THE FAMILIES THROUGH PERSONAL INFLUENCE THE INVESTIGATION OF A CASE OF NEED IS FOLLOWED UP BY THE OUTLINING OF PLANS FOR THE RESTORATION OF THE FAMILY TO INDEPENDENCE AND EFFORTS TO SECURE THE COOPERATION OF SOCIETY CHURCH OR INDIVIDUAL INTERESTED TO ACCOMPLISH THE DEFINITE OBJECT IN HAND WHERE THERE ARE GAPS IN THE CITYS PROVISION FOR ASSISTING FAMILIES THESE ARE FILLED TEMPORARILY AT LEAST BY THE ACTIVITY OF THE SOCIETY AN EMERGENCY AND SPECIAL RELIEF FUND IS MAINTAINED THE EMERGENCY FUND FOR PROVIDING TEMPORARY AID QUICKLY AS THERE IS NO SOCIETY IN THE COM MUNITY THAT WILL DO THIS AND THE SPECIAL RELIEF FUND FOR SECURING ADEQUATE I93PHILANTHROPY CHARITIES AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS RELIEF IN THOSE SPECIAL CASES WHERE IT CANNOT BE SECURED FROM OTHER SOURCES A PROVIDENT SAVINGS FUND HAS BEEN INAUGURATED WITH A PAID COLLECTOR WHO IS DOING MISSIONARY WORK TEACHING THRIFT AND ECONOMY AND GIVING A NEW CONCEPTION TO THE BENEFICIARIES OF THE PURPOSES OF CHARITY BY COOPERATION WITH ONE OF THE LODGING HOUSES AND WOOD YARDS FOR MEN WHICH HAD PREVIOUSLY GIVEN WORK ONLY TO HOMELESS MEN THE SOCIETY HAS NOW A MEANS OF FURNISHING EMERGENCY WORK TO THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY AS A TEST AND TO TIDE OVER UNTIL SOMETHING MORE PERMANENT CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED COINCIDENT WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS MACHINERY THE SOCIETY HAS PUT ITS HAND TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF FRIENDLY VISITOR WORK ALONG DEFINITE LINES THE DISTRICT CONFERENCES DISTRICT NOW ONLY IN NAME AS THEY MEET AT THE CENTRAL OFFICE FOR THE TIME BEING HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED INTO FRIENDLY VISITOR CONFERENCES FOR PERSONAL WORK WITH NEEDY FAMILIES IT MIGHT BE SAID IN PASSING THAT THE SOCIETY RECOGNIZES THE NEED OF THE DISTRICT SYSTEM OF ORGANIZA TION IN NEWARK AND HOPES TO RETURN TO THAT SYSTEM WHEN ITS RESOURCES ARE LARGER AND ITS VITAL HOLD UPON THE PUBLIC GREATER IN THE MEANTIME UNDER THE PRESIDENCY OF AN ACTIVE AND ENTHUSIASTIC CHAIRMAN THE CONFERENCES ARE DEVELOPING ALONG FRIENDLY VISITOR LINES THIS WORK IS IN CHARGE OF THE ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT SO THAT THE VISITORS ARE UNDER CONSTANT DIRECTION OF A TRAINED WORKER IN ORDER TO CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE FOR REAL COOPERATION AND TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR PROGRESSIVE IDEAS OF CHARITY TO OBTAIN THE SOCIETY HAS SECURED THE ORGANIZATION OF THE NEWARK CONFERENCE OF CHARITIES AND CORRECTION WHICH IS SUCCESSFULLY ENTERING ITS SECOND YEAR ITS MEMBERSHIP CONSISTS OF DELEGATES FROM TWENTYSEVEN SOCIETIES AND TWENTYSEVEN CHURCHES FOUR OR FIVE PUBLIC MEETINGS ARE HELD EACH WINTER AT WHICH SPEAKERS OF NOTE FROM OUT OF TOWN PRESENT THE BEST METHODS AND IDEAS OF THE PHASES OF CHARITABLE WORK DISCUSSED FOLLOWED BY A PRESENTATION OF THE LOCAL WORK FOLLOWED WITH QUESTIONS AND DISCUSSION AMONG THE QUESTIONS TAKEN UP

THE GREAT FIRE IN BALTIMORE IN FEBRUARY I904 A COMMITTEE OF TWENTY SIX REPRESENTATIVE CITIZENS ON RELIEF OF NEED WAS APPOINTED BY THE MAYOR WITH DR JEFFREY R BRACKETT AS CHAIRMAN THE COMMITTEE ADOPTED THE FOL LOWING PRINCIPLES OF ACTION THAT RELIEF WAS TO BE GIVEN ONLY TO CASES OF ACTUAL NEED TO SECURE THE NECESSITIES OF LIFE OR TO PROVIDE MEANS BY WHICH SUFFERERS I CONTRIBUTED BY A W MCDOUGALL 193THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY WOULD BE ENABLED TO PROCURE THEM THAT THERE WAS TO BE NO REIMBURSEMENT AGAINST LOSS BY FIRE THAT RELIEF SHOULD BE ADEQUATE REGARDLESS OF THE AMOUNT THAT PERSONS WERE EXPECTED TO TRY EVERY SOURCE AVAILABLE BEFORE APPLYING TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ASSISTANCE THAT ALL CASES POSSIBLE SHOULD BE HANDLED BY ESTABLISHED CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS THAT SUFFERERS OF VARIOUS NATIONALITIES AND AFFILIATIONS SHOULD BE DEALT WITH BY THEIR OWN SOCIETIES AND ASSOCIATIONS THAT CAREFUL AND SYMPATHETIC INVESTIGATION SHOULD BE MADE IN EVERY CASE TO DETERMINE THE CHARACTER AND AMOUNT OF NEED THE CALL OF THE COMMITTEE WAS PROMPTLY AND EFFECTIVELY RESPONDED TO BY CHURCHES CHARITABLE ORGANIZA TIONS AND PUBLIC BODIES SUCH AS THE STATE EMPLOYMENT BUREAU THE COM MITTEE FOUND IT NECESSARY TO ENGAGE ONLY THREE EMPLOYEES LATER THE LEGISLA TURE APPROPRIATED 170000 FOR THE RELIEF OF NEED DUE TO THE FIRE OF THIS AMOUNT ONLY 23000 WAS EXPENDED ALTHOUGH EVERY CASE REQUIRING AID THAT CAME BEFORE THE COMMITTEE WAS LIBERALLY HELPED THE EXPENSES OF ADMINIS TERING THE RELIEF WERE BETWEEN 7 PER CENT AND 8 PER CENT OF THE TOTAL EXPENDI TURE 1063 DIFFERENT FAMILIES WERE ASSISTED IN

OF THE CONDITION OF THE POOR THE CHARITY ORGANIZATION SOCIETY AND THE CHILDRENS AID SOCIETY THE BUILDING WAS PROVIDED BY THE ASSOCIATION FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE CONDITION OF THE POOR FROM A LEGACY THE SIXTYFIRST ANNUAL REPORT OF THE NEW YORK ASSOCIATION FOR IMPROVING THE CONDITION OF THE POOR IS SO INTERESTING THAT IT OUGHT TO HAVE A MUCH WIDER CIRCULATION THAN IT NEEDS FOR ITS OWN PURPOSES THE REPORT IS SIGNED BY R FULTON CUTTING PRESIDENT AND WILLIAM H ALLEN GENERAL AGENT ITS AUTHORS HAVE THE RARE FACULTY OF VISUALIZING FOR US THE VERY REAL PEOPLE WITH WHOM THE ASSOCIATION HAS TO DEAL THE ART OF PUTTING THINGS ATTRACTIVELY IS ILLUSTRATED AT THE OPENING OF THE REPORT WHICH BEGINS AS FOLLOWS FRIENDS OF OUR FRESH AIR WORK AT SEA BREEZE WILL BE PLEASED TO LEARN THAT THE STRETCH OF SAND THAT FOR SO MANY SUMMERS HAD GROWN ONLY RANK MARSH GRASS PRODUCED NOT ONLY FLOWERS BUT RADISHES LETTUCE BEANS CUCUM BERS SWEET CORN TOMATOES AND PUMPKINS TENEMENT CHILDREN REARED IN KITCHENS PLUNGED HEADLONG INTO THE WARM COLORS AND CRIPPLED CHILDREN FROM THE TENT CAMP MADE A DAILY PILGRIMAGE TO GATHER BOUQUETS FOR THEIR NURSES AND FOR THEIR OWN DORMITORIES AND DININGROOM AGED WOMEN WERE REMINDED OF PEASANT LIFE IN GERMANY OR IRELAND YET ALL THIS HAPPINESS COST LESS CONTRIBUTED BY JOHN M GLENN SUPERVISOR OF CITY CHARITIES BALTIMORE MD I96PHILANTHROPY CHARITIES AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS THAN IOO DESPITE THE DECLARATION OF EXPERTS THAT IT WAS SIMPLY IMPOSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE RESULTS WORTH WHILE WITHOUT FIRST EXPENDING 500 TO IOOO FROM THE PICTURE OF SEA BREEZE ONES THOUGHTS ARE LED TO THE WORK OF THE PUBLIC BATH HOUSES IN WHICH 233000 BATHS WERE GIVEN DURING THE YEAR IN THIS CONNECTION THE ASSOCIATION HAS DONE A RATHER UNUSUAL THING IN POINTING OUT THAT THE TOTALS ARE FOR BATHS NOT BATHERS THE REPORT SHOWS TAKING THE RIVINGTON BATH AS AN ILLUSTRATION THAT ASSUMING EACH PATRON OF IT GOES AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK THE 750000 BATHS GIVEN EVERY WEEK ARE ENJOYED BY SOME 14000 INDIVIDUALS AMONG A POPULATION OF OVER HALF A MILLION WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE IF WE ASSUME THAT AT LEAST THREE MEMBERS OF A FAMILY PATRONIZE THE BATH WEEKLY WE THEN HAVE LESS THAN 5000 FAMILIES ENJOYING THE BENEFITS OF THAT ONE BATH THERE IS A LIMIT TO THE DISTANCE WHICH PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO WALK OR WHICH IN VERY HOT WEATHER OR VERY COLD WEATHER IT IS DESIRABLE THAT THEY SHOULD WALK IN ORDER TO TAKE A BATH EVEN CLEANLINESS MAY COST TOO MUCH WE HAVE REACHED A POINT IN THE MOVEMENT FOR PUBLIC BATH HOUSES IN NEW YORK WHEN WE MUST EMPHASIZE THE NECESSITY OF BATHS AS NEIGHBOR HOOD FACILITIES A UNIQUE DEVELOPMENT IN RELIEF WORK IS THE EMPLOYMENT BY THE ASSO CIATION OF VISITING CLEANERS TO SUPPLEMENT THE WORK OF THE VISITING NURSES OUR FIRST CLEANER WAS PERSUADED TO TRY THE WORK FOR ONE WEEK IN THAT TIME SHE COOKED MEALS FOR SICK MOTHERS BATHED THEIR CHILDREN CARED FOR UNKEMPT HEADS DID A DAYS WASHING AND THOROUGHLY CLEANED THE HOUSE AT THE END OF THAT TIME SHE CAME TO US AND ANNOUNCED THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO CONTINUE IN HER WORDS I THOUGHT I KNEW ALL THE SMELLS THERE WAS BUT I DIDNT WE ASKED HER IF SHE HAD NOT REALIZED THAT SHE HAD GIVEN HAPPINESS WHICH NEITHER THE NURSE THE PHYSICIAN NOR THE PASTOR COULD GIVE THE FOSTER HOUSEWIFE WAS PERSUADED TO GO ON HER WORK GREW UNTIL WE FOUND FOUR WOMEN WHO WERE WILLING TO GO INTO HOMES FOR THE PURPOSE OF LIFTING TEMPORARILY THE SIMPLE EVERYDAY DOMESTIC BURDEN FROM SICK MOTHERS DOES ANY ONE BELIEVE THAT IO GIVEN IN BROKEN BREAD IN PENNIES AND NICKELS WILL GIVE AS MUCH HAPPINESS AND ACCOMPLISH AS LASTING RESULTS AT THE SERVICE OF THE VISITING CLEANER WHO FOR THAT SUM CAN BRING SUNSHINE HAPPINESS CLEANLINESS AND FRESH AIR TO A SCORE OR MORE OF HOMES ANOTHER NEW DEPARTURE IS THE EXPERIMENT CONDUCTED AT SEA BREEZE IN THE SALT AIR TREATMENT FOR CHILDREN SUFFERING FROM TUBERCULOSIS OF THE BONES AND GLANDS IN THE SUMMER OF I903 MR JOHN SEELY WARD JR INSPECTED VARIOUS FRENCH HOSPITALS FOR THE TREATMENT OF TUBERCULOSIS UPON HIS RETURN HE REPORTED THAT WHILE IN THE TREATMENT OF CHILDREN SUFFERING FROM TUBERCULOSIS OF THE LUNGS AMERICAN METHODS ARE QUITE AS ADVANCED AS THOSE IN FRANCE THE SAME CANNOT BE SAID OF OUR TREATMENT OF CHILDREN SUFFERING FROM NON PULMONARY FORMS OF TUBERCULOSIS THIS SEEMS ALL THE MORE REMARKABLE IF IT IS REMEMBERED THAT WHEN TUBERCULOSIS ATTACKS CHILDREN IT IS MORE FREQUENTLY IN THE BONES OR LYMPH GLANDS OR SKIN OR ABDOMINAL ORGANS ETC RARELY IN THE LUNGS THE AMERICAN TREATMENT IN THESE CASES DIFFERS FROM THAT OF THE FRENCH SEASIDE HOSPITALS IN THAT HERE WE ATTEMPT TO ARREST THE TUBERCULAR PROCESS BY OPERATIONS BRACES AND INDOOR TREATMENT LETTERS OF INQUIRY WERE WRITTEN TO A SCORE OF REPRESENTATIVE PHYSICIANS I97THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY IN AMERICAN CITIES WITH ONE EXCEPTION THEY EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT AN EXPERIMENT BE MADE THE NEW YORK BOARD OF HEALTH ESTIMATES THAT THERE ARE FROM FOUR TO FIVE THOUSAND CHILDREN UNDER FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE IN NEW YORK CITY ALONE SUFFERING FROM NONPULMONARY FORMS OF TUBERCULOSIS AT LEAST THREEFOURTHS OF THESE ARE TO BE FOUND IN THE TENEMENT DISTRICTS THE URGENCY OF THE NEED WAS APPARENT IT WAS A PATHETIC GROUP OF CHILDREN WHO CAME TO US ON JUNE 6TH SO WEAK AND EMACIATED THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO SEND ONE ADULT FOR EACH CHILD IT IS NOT AN EXAGGERATION TO SAY THAT AT THE PRESENT TIME IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO SELECT AMONG NORMAL CHILDREN IN OUR TENEMENT DISTRICTS FIFTY WHO LOOK AS HAPPY AS RUDDY AS RUGGED AS THOSE AMONG OUR EARLIEST PATIENTS WHO HAVE REMAINED UNTIL THE END OF THE SUMMER OUR CHIEF REGRET IS THAT SO FEW OF THE MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS AND THE LAYMEN INTERESTED IN THE CRUSADE AGAINST CONSUMPTION HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE FOR THEMSELVES THE LIFE AT OUR CAMP THE SUCCESS OF THE EXPERIMENT HAS BEEN SO MARKED THAT IT IS TO BE CONTINUED THROUGHOUT THE WINTER IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE IN THE SPACE THE ANNALS CAN GIVE TO THIS REPORT TO MORE THAN BARELY INDICATE THE SPIRIT AND CHARACTER OF THE SPLENDIDLY PRO GRESSIVE WORK OF THE ASSOCIATION WITH REGARD TO THE HIGH COST OF PROFESSIONAL SERVICE DR ALLEN SAYS IN SPITE OF CAREFUL ECONOMY RELIEF WORK BECOMES MORE COSTLY AS IT BECOMES BETTER FOR INSTANCE WE HAVE TO EMPLOY AN INCREASED NUMBER OF VISITORS NOT ONLY BECAUSE WE ARE CALLED UPON TO INVESTIGATE THE INCREASED NUMBER OF FAMILIES BUT ALSO BECAUSE WE FIND THAT EACH FAMILY NEEDS FOR SUCH RELIEF AS WILL RESTORE ITS SELFDEPENDENCE AN INCREASED AMOUNT OF ATTENTION AND THOUGHT TO BE EFFECTIVE THIS ATTENTION AND THOUGHT CALL FOR A HIGH DEGREE OF INTELLIGENCE SYMPATHY AND PATIENT SKILL ON THE PART OF EACH VISITOR WHO DESERVES AND MUST RECEIVE AN ADEQUATE COMPENSATION WE ARE AWARE THAT A QUESTION STILL LINGERS IN THE MINDS OF MANY EVEN AMONG CONTRIBUTORS TO WORK LIKE OURS AS TO THE PROPER PROPORTION BETWEEN THE AMOUNT GIVEN IN RELIEF AND THE EXPENSE OF ADMINISTERING THAT RELIEF BUT THIS QUESTION IS REALLY UNIMPORTANT COMPARED WITH THE INQUIRY WHAT IS THE CHARACTER OF THE ASSISTANCE RENDERED BY OUR VISITORS TO THOSE WHOSE NEEDS ARE BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION FOR SIXTY ODD YEARS THIS ASSOCIATION HAS LABORED TO ERADICATE VAGRANCY AT TIMES WE LIKE OTHERS HAVE PLACED THE EMPHASIS UPON THE UNWORTHINESS THE MEANNESS AND THE VICIOUSNESS OF THE VAGRANT WILL YOU NOT AS CONTRIBU TORS HELP US NOW TO ESTABLISH MORE GENERALLY IN THE PUBLIC MIND WHAT TO US IS A TRUISM IT IS CRUEL IT IS INHUMANE IT IS UNCHRISTIAN TO GIVE A MAN A NICKEL WHO NEEDS TWO WEEKS IN THE HOSPITAL IT IS UNCHRISTIAN TO PERMIT AN AGED WOMAN TO GO FROM DOOR TO DOOR SUFFERING REBUFFS AND ABUSE AND SCORN APPEALING FOR AN UNDERGARMENT TO KEEP HER WARM WHEN BY COOPERATING WITH OTHERS WE CAN PLACE THAT AGED WOMAN IN A COMFORTABLE HOME MENDICANCY THRIVES BECAUSE THE MENDICANT IS GIVEN TOO LITTLE BECAUSE HE RECEIVES THAT WHICH HURTS AND DEMORALIZES INSTEAD OF THAT WHICH CURES AND ELEVATES THE ALMS GIVEN TO A PROFESSIONAL BEGGAR ARE ALMOST INVARIABLY BOTH THE INCENTIVE AND THE MEANS OF FURTHER DEGRADATION THE VAGRANT WHO COMES TO US AFFIRM I98PHILANTHROPY CHARITIES AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS ING HIS DESIRE TO REESTABLISH HIMSELF IS GIVEN NOT MERELY A NIGHTS LODGING A PAIR OF SHOES OR TWO MEALS BUT IS GIVEN A CHANCE OUR INTEREST DOES NOT DIS APPEAR WITH THE FIRST WORD OF ADVICE OR THE FIRST MATERIAL RELIEF IT CONTINUES JUST AS LONG AS THE APPLICANT WILL MAKE AN EFFORT TO GAIN A FOOTING DURING THE YEAR THE ASSOCIATION HAS ADDED 506 CONTRIBUTORS AND 10452 TO ITS GENERAL FUND AND 202 CONTRIBUTORS AND 2772 TO THE FRESH AIR FUND AN ACHIEVEMENT WHICH INDICATES THE GENERAL APPRECIATION BY THE COMMUNITY OF THE MERITS OF THE EXCELLENT WORK WHICH THE ASSOCIATION IS DOING THE NEW JERSEY STATE HOME FOR GIRLS SITUATED AT TRENTON OCCUPIES EIGHTY ACRES SIXTY BEING UNDER CULTIVATION AND TWENTY WOODLAND IT IS AN IDEAL SPOT BEING ABOUT THE HIGHEST POINT IN TRENTON AN ABUNDANCE OF PLAIN WELLCOOKED FOOD REGULAR HOURS AND DUTIES KEEP THE GIRLS IN GOOD HEALTH NO FENCES MAR THE VIEW AND AS FAR AS POSSIBLE THE INDIVIDUAL HOME LIFE IDEA IS CARRIED OUT NINETY GIRLS ARE HOUSED IN A LARGE RAMBLING BUILDING AND THIRTYSIX IN THE HONOR OR VOORHEES COTTAGE IT IS OUT OF THE QUESTION TO MAKE THE CLASSIFICATIONS NECESSARY TO BRING ABOUT THE PROPER RESULTS WHERE SO MANY GIRLS ARE HOUSED UNDER ONE ROOF WITH BUT THIN PLASTER PARTITIONS SEPARATING THEM GIRLS WHO HAVE BEEN TEMPTED TO TAKE MONEY FROM THEIR PARENTS BUT WHO HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN BLAMELESS IN THEIR LIVES SHOULD NOT BE ASSOCIATED WITH GIRLS TAKEN FROM DISORDERLY HOUSES LITTLE CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED WHERE SO MUCH OPPORTUNITY IS AFFORDED TO SWAP EXPERIENCES IF THE LEGISLATURE WILL GRANT AN ADEQUATE APPROPRIATION IT WILL ENABLE THE BOARD TO UNDERTAKE A LARGE AND IMPORTANT WORK MANY YEARS AGO IT WAS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE CONGREGATE SYSTEM IS VERY UNSATISFACTORY THAT THE NEARER WE CAN APPROACH THE HOME LIFE THE BETTER THE RESULTS TWO ADDITIONAL COTTAGES ARE NEEDED WITH PERHAPS A ONESTORY BUILDING TO BE USED AS AN INFIRMARY WITH OUR PRESENT ACCOMMODATIONS DISEASED GIRLS ARE DIFFI CULT TO ISOLATE AND IN CASE OF CONTAGIOUS ILLNESS WE HAVE NO PROVISION AT ALL FOR THEIR CARE WHERE GIRLS SHOW A FITNESS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION THIS IS DEVELOPED EARLY THIS FALL ONE GIRL WAS ENTERED IN AN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION OUTSIDE OF THE STATE THE NECESSARY FUNDS BEING SECURED THROUGH PRIVATE SOURCES AS THE STATE CANNOT SPEND ITS FUNDS OUTSIDE OF ITS OWN BOUNDARIES ANOTHER GIRL WAS ENTERED IN A LARGE HOSPITAL TO BE TRAINED AS A NURSE AND THE BOARD HAS NOW UNDER CON SIDERATION THE TRAINING OF A GIRL TO BE A STENOGRAPHER AND OF STILL ANOTHER AS A

GLADLY APOLOGIZE AND BEHAVE HERSELF THE NEXT EVENING IF ALLOWED TO JOIN THE CIRCLE IN ADDITION TO THE FESTIVITIES ON THE VARIOUS HOLIDAYS THERE WAS A LAWN PARTY ON THE GROUNDS OF ONE OF OUR FRIENDS IN TRENTON WHEN FIFTYFOUR OF OUR GIRLS WHO HAD NOT BEEN MARKED WERE ENTERTAINED IN A WAY NOT TO BE FORGOTTEN FIFTY GIRLS WHO HAD NOT BEEN MARKED VISITED THE STATE FAIR WERE PROVIDED WITH SEATS ON THE GRAND STAND AND BEHAVED THEMSELVES IN A WAY TO PLEASE ALL OUR FRIENDS THIS TRIP TO THE FAIR MEANT A RIDE ON A TROLLEY AND A TRANSFER TO ANOTHER AND MINGLING IN A CROWDED ASSEMBLY BUT WITHOUT A SINGLE INSTANCE OF THE SLIGHTEST MISCONDUCT AND YET THERE WAS NO DISPOSITION ON THE PART OF ANYONE TO PERCEPTIBLY RESTRAIN THEM SMALL GROUPS OF GIRLS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO THE STORES AND CHURCHES THAT THEY MAY BE FAMILIARIZED WITH GENERAL CONDI TIONS OF ORDINARY LIFE AND THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN MOST SATISFACTORY OUR GIRLS HAVE COME TO US THROUGH FAILURE OF THEIR NATURAL GUARDIANS TO CARE FOR THEM THEY DO NOT COME TO US TO BE PUNISHED BUT TO BE TRAINED FOR LIVES OF USEFULNESS WE DENY THEM PRIVILEGES RATHER THAN INFLICT PUNISHMENT AND TRY TO DEVELOP THE BEST IN THEIR NATURE HUMAN NATURE IS VERY MUCH THE SAME EVERYWHERE AND WHAT IS GOOD FOR A GIRL IN HER OWN HOME HELPS A GIRL IN THE STATE HOME THE NATIONAL CONGRESS OF MOTHERSTHE PURPOSE OF THE CONGRESS IS TO EXTEND THE INFLUENCE OF EARNEST THOUGHTFUL MOTHERHOOD SO THAT IT SHALL REACH THE CHILDHOOD OF THE WORLD THE UNIVERSAL NEEDS OF CHILDHOOD ARE CONSIDERED BY THE MOTHERS CONGRESS WITH THE DETERMINATION TO PROVIDE THE BEST OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF EVERY CHILD WHATEVER THWARTS OR FURTHERS THIS PURPOSE COMES LEGITIMATELY INTO THE WORK OF THE CONGRESS THE PROTECTION OF CHILDREN LEADS INTO MANY DEPARTMENTS OF WORK 4 CONTRIBUTED BY ELIZABETH V H MANSELL 200PHILANTHROPY CHARITIES AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS THERE MUST BE SENTIMENT IN THE WORK FOR LOVE IS THE ATMOSPHERE OF MOTHERHOOD BUT WITH THE SENTIMENT THERE MUST BE GOOD PRACTICAL COMMON SENSE KNOWLEDGE OF CHILDNATURE AND ITS NEEDS AND INSIGHT INTO THE CAUSES WHICH MAKE OR MAR THE CHILDHOOD OF THE RACE THE ORGANIZATION OF A NATIONAL BODY OF WOMEN WHOSE PURPOSE IS THE GUARDIANSHIP OF EVERY CHILD IS A STRONG FACTOR IN RAISING THE STANDARD OF THE NATION A GOOD HOME IS THE MOST POWERFUL INFLUENCE FOR GOOD THAT CAN SURROUND CHILDREN PARENTS WHO COMPREHEND CHILDNATURE AND MAKE IT THEIR FIRST DUTY TO CARE WISELY FOR THEIR CHILDREN MAKE A GOOD HOME WHETHER IT IS IN THE POOREST COTTAGE OR THE RICHEST PALACE THEREFORE THE EFFORT TO REACH AND ELE VATE EVERY HOME BECOMES NECESSARY IF CHILDREN ARE TO DEVELOP AS THEY SHOULD MANY PEOPLE EDUCATED ON OTHER LINES HAVE LITTLE OR NO UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO BRING UP A CHILD THE CONGRESS HAS RECEIVED THE HELP OF THE EDUCATORS PHYSICIANS PSYCHOLO GISTS AND SPECIALISTS IN MANY FIELDS AND HAS BECOME A NATIONAL DIRECTORY FOR ALL WHO DESIRE TO STUDY CHILD LIFE IN THE LIGHT OF CAREFUL RESEARCH THE MOST EFFECTIVE METHOD OF WORK IS BY ESTABLISHING CHILD STUDY CIRCLES MOTHERS CLUBS OR PARENTS ASSOCIATIONS IN EVERY SCHOOL THE CONGRESS HAS PREPARED OUTLINES FOR STUDY SUGGESTIVE BOOK LISTS FOR MOTHERS AND CHILDREN AND PROGRAMS FOR MANY MEETINGS WHICH ARE OF PRACTICAL HELP TO MOTHERS AND FATHERS THE SCHOOL GAINS THE SYMPATHETIC COOPERATION OF ITS PATRONS AND IN EDUCATIONAL AND FINANCIAL LINES IS THE GAINER THEREBY WHILE THE BENEFIT TO THE CHILDREN CANNOT BE ESTIMATED THE TWO STRONGEST INFLUENCES IN CHILD LIFE ARE HOME AND SCHOOL AND TO MAKE THEM PULL TOGETHER IS VERY NECESSARY TO THE ATTAINMENT OF THE BEST RESULTS THE CONGRESS HAS MADE AN EXHAUSTIVE STUDY OF LEGISLATION AFFECTING CHILDHOOD AND ALSO OF CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE COUNTRY IT RECOG NIZES A GREAT LACK OF MOTHERTHOUGHT IN LEGISLATION PROTECTING CHILDRENS INTER ESTS IT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN WINNING THE SUPPORT OF LEGISLATORS IN ITS EFFORTS TO BUILD UP IN EACH STATE AN ADEQUATE SYSTEM OF LAWS THE STATE STANDS ABOVE THE PARENT AND SHOULD INSIST ON THE PROVISION OF SUCH CONDITIONS AS WILL GIVE TO EVERY CHILD THE CHANCE WHICH IS HIS INHERENT RIGHT TO DEVELOP NORMALLY THE JUVENILE COURT AND PROBATION SYSTEM WERE ENDORSED BY THE CONGRESS SOON AFTER THEIR ESTABLISHMENT IN CHICAGO AND SHOULD BE INTRODUCED IN EVERY STATE WHEN EFFICIENTLY ADMINISTERED IT IS A VERY EFFECTIVE WAY OF PREVENTING CRIME BECAUSE IT TAKES THE CHILD AT HIS FIRST DOWNWARD STEP THAT GIVES HIM HELP RATHER THAN PUNISHMENT THE CONGRESS BELIEVES THAT MASSING CHILDREN IN REFORMATORIES HAS BEEN PRODUCTIVE OF MUCH HARM AND IT STANDS FOR INDIVIDUAL TREATMENT THE CONGRESS STANDS FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF PROBATION OFFICERS WHO HAVE MADE CHILDSTUDY A SPECIALTY AND WHOSE PATIENCE AND LOVE OF CHILDREN MAKES THE WORK A JOY IT ALSO STANDS FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF SUFFICIENT PRO BATION OFFICERS TO GIVE INDIVIDUAL AND FREQUENT ATTENTION TO EACH CHILD OTHER WISE PROBATION WORK FAILS OF ITS BEST RESULTS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CHILD LABOR LAWS THAT DO NOT DEPRIVE CHILDREN OF HABITS OF INDUSTRY AND DO NOT INTERFERE WITH PHYSICAL AND MENTAL GROWTH HAS BEEN LIKEWISE AN IMPORTANT FEATURE OF THE CONGRESS WORK 20ITHE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY THE CONGRESS HAS BEEN FURTHER OBLIGED TO CONSIDER THE LAWS GOVERNING MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE BECAUSE THE ALARMING INCREASE OF DIVORCES AND THE LACK OF UNIFORMITY IN MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE LAWS WHICH MAKE DIVORCE EASY SERI OUSLY AFFECT CHILDREN THE NATIONAL CONGRESS OF MOTHERS RECEIVED EARNEST AND PERSISTENT APPEALS FROM THE HOMELOVING CHRISTIAN WOMEN OF UTAH TO COME TO THEIR AID IN PROTECTING THEIR HOMES FROM THE DEGRADING INFLUENCES OF THE POLYGAMOUS AND TREASONABLE TEACHINGS AND PRACTICES OF THE MORMON HIERARCHY INVESTIGA TION PROVED THAT THE APPEAL WAS NOT MADE WITHOUT REASONS SO GRAVE THAT THEY COULD NOT BE IGNORED THE RESULT OF THIS CALL FROM THE CONGRESS OF MOTHERS WAS THE ORGANIZATION OF A NATIONAL LEAGUE OF WOMENS ORGANIZATIONS WHICH HAS MADE CONCERTED WORK POSSIBLE FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF THE LEAGUE IS TO DEFEND THE COUNTRY AGAINST THE POLYGAMOUS AND TREASONABLE PRACTICES OF MOR MONISM AND TO MAINTAIN CHRISTIAN STANDARDS OF MARRIAGE THE CONGRESS HAS SHARED WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS IN DEFRAYING THE EXPENSE OF COUNSEL IN THE SMOOT INVESTIGATION IT HAS ARRANGED MANY MEETINGS TO DISSEMINATE FACTS CONCERNING CONDITIONS IN UTAH AND ADJOINING STATES WHICH RAP AT THE FOUNDA TIONS OF HOME LIFE PROTECTION OF HOME AND CHILDHOOD MADE IT NECESSARY TO TAKE DECISIVE MEASURES FOR THEIR DEFENSE THUS IT IS THAT WHILE THE MAIN WORK OF THE CONGRESS IS CONSTRUCTIVE AND EDUCATIONAL IN THE EXIGENCY OF THIS GRAVE MENACE TO THE HONOR OF WOMANHOOD AND THE PURITY OF HOME IT HAS BEEN COMPELLED TO ACT IN THEIR DEFENSE MOTHERHOOD IN ITS HIGHEST SENSE EXTENDS LOVING CARE TO THE CHILDHOOD OF THE WORLD IT RECOGNIZES A GODGIVEN TRUST IN THE CARE OF HIS LITTLE ONES AND IN ORDER TO FULFILL THIS TRUST THE NATIONAL CONGRESS OF MOTHERS HAS BEEN FORMED 1 CONTRIBUTED BY MRS FREDERIC SCHOFF PRESIDENT NATIONAL

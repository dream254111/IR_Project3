the financial control of the Committee for Sci entific and Industrial Research though its scientific work and researches remain under the direction of the Royal Society as before and its annual report of which the London Times gives an abstract is for the first time published by the Stationery Office 2s 6d n As has been the case since 1914 a large part of the laboratorys work last year was in con nection with the requirements of the war and therefore can not be described in detail even if referred to at all but there is a considerable body of investigations to which this limitation does not apply In the electrical department additional mag netograph 24hour records were taken and co incidences found between the running of electric trains on the London and South Western Railway and magnetic disturbances at the laboratory The question as to the mag nitude and cause of certain of the disturbances was submitted to the arbitration of Mr A J Walter KC in November and December and he adjudged that the use of electrical power by the railway has caused an increase in the hori zontal magnetic field at the laboratory to an extent exceeding that stipulated in the South Western Railway Act of 1913 Among general electrical measurements a large number of the small miea condensers used in magnetos were tested for capacity and power factor much work was done in connec tion with the composition and treatment of steel used for compass needles and some spe cial search coils proved valuable in testing permanent horseshoe magnets Some investi gation was also made of the properties of non magnetic steels Sensitive vibration galvan ometers for frequencies of the order of 10 cycles were constructed and some preparations made for a research on effective resistance at radio frequencies A new 400volt secondary battery is being installed for use with large valves to generate the highfrequency current In the division of electrotechnics in view of 284 SCIENCESEPTEMBER 20 1918 the fact that large gasfilled lamps cause con siderable heating of the lamp sockets used with them owing to conduction of heat from the bulbs measurements were made of the tem perature rise of ventilated and unventilated sockets and of the leadingin cables when used in lanterns of both the open and the en closed types It was found that the cables were liable to a total temperature of about 140 C and that little improvement resulted from the use of existing arrangements for socket venti lation Good progress was made with the research on buried cables The electrical constants of all the cables under test were determined and it was found that in general the rise of tem perature of a cable drawn into a stoneware duct was twice that of a similar cable armored and laid direct in the ground cables laid solid in bitumen occupying an intermedi ate position Other points such as the length of time required by the cables to attain their maximum temperature the effect of the ends and the temperature gradient in the duct and in the cable were also dealt with The design of the special motorgenerator set which will be used to supply continuous current for the cables and which will also be used for heavy test work has been settled and the machine is under construction It consists of two continu ouscurrent generators each fitted with two commutators Each commutator is arranged for a current of 1250 amperes at 6 volts the ends being brought to a seriesparalleling board By this means currents up to 1250 amperes at 24 volts will be available for the cable tests and up to 5000 amperes at 6 volts for the test work suitable regulation to any required cur rent being obtained by resistances in the ex citing circuits The generators which will be driven by a threephase 3000volt motor run ning off the town supply will be separately excited the excitation current being main tained constant by a centrifugal spring regu lator putting resistance into or out of the field of the motor The heat division collaborated with the Heating and Cooking Panel of the Engineer ing Standards Association in developing effi ciency tests for electrical plates and cooking stoves A number of pyrometer sheaths of British manufacture were tested for their softening point and porosity at high tempera ture Some of the samples of porcelain though unglazed stood the porosity test re markably well in fact when the interior was exhausted to a pressure of a few millimeters of mercury the walls collapsed under the external pressure before any leakage occurred On the other hand tubes of fireclay and shrunk alumina often showed a return to atmospheric pressure in about 10 seconds A large series of aluminium alloys was investigated for thermal conductivity on behalf of the Light Alloys Subcommittee of the Advisory Com mittee for Aeronautics the advantages of such alloys on account of their high conduc tivity for the construction of the cylinders and pistons of aero engines having been ap preciated for some time It was evident at the outset that measurements at room tempera ture would not be sufficient since the tempera tures encountered in actual practise range up to 300 C and an absolute and expeditious method of determining thermal conductivity and its variation with temperature was there fore devised In Metrology the year was distinguished by the development of the gaugetesting work The new gaugetesting building was completed in May and occupied in the early part of June The numbers dealt with however con tinued to increase and at the end of 1917 were more than double those of 1916 There was a steady increase in the quantity of screw gauges tested but in the first three months of this year there was a considerable reduction in gauges of the more simple types The types that continue to be received are however in general more complicated and involve more work in testing than those which have dropped out The gaugerectifying shop was found much too small to meet the demands made upon it and the erection of a new workshop of 10000 square feet area was sanctioned The building of this has been started Arrangements have been made for the cali bration of glass volumetric apparatus Accom SCIENCE 285N S VOL XLVIII No 1238 modation for the work will be provided in a new threestory building to be erected along side the Administration Building but mean time a house close to the laboratory entrance is being equipped temporarily for the purpose A watch sent for testing by Paul Ditisheim La Chaux de Fonds Switzerland obtained 962 marks out of a possible 100the highest total yet recorded in the Kew trials The investigations of the methods of notched bar impact testing were continued and in the present year it is proposed to inquire into the following questions Need for test bars of dif ferent sizes the question of test bars supported at two ends or fixed at one end how far the work of fracture depends on the crosssection or the volume of the test bar or both and whether a relation can be found for reducing results on one size of bar to those on another influence of the velocity of striking and angle of bend of the bar and application of notched bar tests to carbon steels in industrial prod ucts The hardness test research is being ex tended to cover the effect of the wear caused by sliding abrasion of variations in the rela tive velocity of the surfaces and of the pres sure between them The Brinell ball test usually adopted for indicating the indenta tion hardness of a material is open to the ob jection that it varies with the load and with the hardness of ball used Hence a standard ball of 10 mm diameter and a fixed load of 3000 kg are employed but it is not always possible to use this standarde g with very thin test pieces or very soft materials Ex periments have therefore been made with the object of studying the various methods of bringing results obtained with different balls and loads into line with those obtained by using the standard The experiments with the apparatus described in last years report for determining the heat transmission to water from the internal sur faces of brass pipes smooth and roughened were completed The results showed that with the amount of roughening obtained the heat transmission per unit surface per degree in difference of temperature between metal and water for the smooth pipe could be in creased in the ratio of about 25 to 1 for the same mean velocity of flow It was obvious that if improvements of this order could be made in the surfaces of aircooled engines and radiators considerable economy of material could be effected in aeroplane engine design To test the question a series of copper gills of the form and distribution commonly adopted in aircooled engines was fixed to the cylinder of the engine and set up in a wind channel An electric current was then circulated through the gills and from measurements of the current and resistance it was possible to ascertain the temperature of the gills and the heat dissipated The gills were first tested in their ordinary smooth condition and then roughened by means of corrugated steel dies The roughening however appeared to produce practically no effect on the heat transmission this result indicating that the convection of momentum to the rough and smo6th surfaces was approximately the same The reason for this apparent discrepancy between the two sets of observations is still under investigation The demands of the Aerodynamics Depart ment are so numerous and important that the erection of two new air channels has been called for A new airscreen balance for the 7 foot tunnel is in hand and a new apparatus for lift measurement is in use Mlodified ap paratus for the measurement of rotary deriva tives was devised and will be further de veloped The research work carried out was of the most varied character Tests were made on models of aeroplane wings monoplane and bi plane models of complete aeroplanes airships and kite balloon models and models of air screws with calculations relating to stability strength of construction bombdropping etc A large amount of work was done in con nection with the design of wind channels and the research on eddy motion was continued Many of the investigations were made in response to direct requests from the Air Min istry but every effort was made to increase the value of special tests by bringing them into proper relation as part of an organized scheme of research 286 SCIENCESEPTEMBER 20 19181 Such increase in equipment as was made in the Metallurgy Department arose chiefly in connection with the extension of foundry fa cilities urgently needed for the work on light alloys and on optical glass The investigation on aluminium and other light alloys was ener getically pursued and was devoted to the im mediate requirements of aircraft construction A considerable amount of theoretical investi gation was also carried on leading to the establishment of a number of constitutional models of ternary alloys of aluminium with other metals A number of important prac tical questions were thus cleared up among them being the explanation of the various forms in which silicon is found analytically in aluminium alloys and the bearing of these re sults on the properties of the materials Other researches had for their object the elucidation of apparently anomalous behavior in various groups of aluminium alloys The nature and constitution of the more important ternary alloys and the influence of impurities on them were investigated with the result that these relationships are now much better understood A large amount of research and investi gatory test work was carried out on steel Some of the results obtained seem to be of wide importance in regard to the treatment to which particularly thick boiler plates can be safely subjected Research on magnetic steels was actively continued Investigation was begun of a set of specially made tungsten steels of graded composition received from Messrs Thomas Firth and Sons but it was found necessary to adopt better methods of magnetic measurement than were used in the earlier stages of the work and special arrange ments were also made for carrying out thermal observations of these steels in a more satis factory manner A number of discrepancies were revealed believed to arise from the in  fluence which antecedent thermal and mechan ical treatment of the steel exercises on its sub squent magnetic behavior To clear up these questions which are of vital importance in the production of satisfactory magnets and which involve questions affecting steels other than the particular tungsten alloys under in vestigation a special research was initiated for the study of the constitutional relations of ironcarbontungsten within the range of al loys concerned The work in connection with the proposed issue of standardized steel samples to serve as standards for the chemical analysis of steels was carried forward in conjunction with a committee of the Iron and Steel Institute but was hampered by existing conditions It is hoped however that the issue of standard ized samples may become possible shortly As regards optical glass a large amount of work was done in preparing pots or crucibles of special refractory materials that do not lend themselves to treatment by ordinary methods Methods of melting and stirring glass were further investigated by means of experimental meltings some of which gave results of great promise The testing of ship models for firms in the experimental tank was affected in two ways First the building of fast and intermediate liners being in temporary abeyance there was no demand for model work with those types of vessel Second the introduction of standard vessels must result in the suppression of indi viduality in the forms adopted by different builders and the model results for one firm will apply to all vessels of the type no matter where built It is therefore the more impor tant that steps should be taken to ensure that whatever forms are adopted as standard shall be good ones Private firms have recognized this and about half the vessels tested for firms during the year were in connection with stan dardization The best result obtained was a reduction of 13 per cent in resistance without any variation of displacement or dimensions or diminution of working qualities such as stability Apart from tests for private firms a number of models of standard cargo vessels were made and tested for the Admiralty and others There were a number of tests with straight line forms of fabricated ships and the satisfactory results obtained must lead to an extension of the use of this type if it is found to be constructionally acceptable SCIENCE

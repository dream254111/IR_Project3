J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1074664,THE TRAINING OF TEACHERS FOR SECONDARY SCHOOLS,I244496,THE TRAINING OF TEACHERS FOR SECONDARY SCHOOLS MAN MAKING IS THE MOST DIVINE OF ALL ARTS WHEN WE CON SIDER HOW OLD AN ART THE ART OF TEACHING IS WE ARE SURPRISED THAT THE IDEA OF SPECIAL TRAINING FOR TEACHERS IS OF SO COMPARATIVELY RECENT A BIRTH ITS GROWTH AND PROGRESS FINALLY IF NOT ITS BIRTH HAS BEEN DUE TO A CHANGED CONCEPTION OF LIFE AND ITS POSSIBILI TIES AND HENCE A WONDERFUL INCREASE IN THE RESPECT IN WHICH EDUCATION IS HELD A STRENGTHENING OF FAITH IN ITS EFFICACY TO GIVE GREATER HAPPINESS AND A HIGHER LIFE TO THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE RACE IT IS ONLY WITHIN THE MEMORY OF MEN OF OUR OWN GENERA TION THAT THE STATIC CONCEPTION OF LIFE WHICH HELD SWAY FOR SO MANY CENTURIES HAS GIVEN WAY TO THE DYNAMIC CONCEPTION THIS CHANGE HAS FORMULATED ITSELF IN EMPHASIZING THE IDEA OF DEVELOPMENT AS APPLIED TO THE LIFE OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE IDEA OF EVOLUTION AS APPLIED TO LIFE IN ITS ENTIRETY THIS IDEA OF DEVELOPMENT THIS DYNAMIC SOLUTION OF LIFE HAS ENTERED INTO THOUGHT ON EDUCATION AND REVOLUTIONIZED IT THE MERE CONCEPT OF DEVELOPMENT AS APPLIED ONLY TO THE LIFETIME OF AN INDIVIDUAL WAS NOT A NEW ONE IN THE FIELD OF EDUCATION ANY SIMPLETON WHO HAS LIVED A SCORE OF YEARS CAN SEE THAT HE HAS DEVELOPED MANY THINKERS HAD SHOWN THAT INFANCY YOUTH AND MANHOOD ARE RELATED ORGANICALLY BUT IT WAS THE RELATING OF INDI VIDUAL DEVELOPMENT TO GENERATIONS AND AEONS OF THE PAST AND LATER THE DISCOVERY THAT THE INDIVIDUAL IN HIS OWN DEVELOPMENT STRIDES IN HASTE THROUGH THE RACESTAGES OF GROWTH THAT GAVE TO THE IDEA OF DEVELOPMENT A NEW LEASE OF LIFEAN IMMORTALITY PERHAPS CERTAINLY AS AN ALLEMBRACING CONCEPT IT STANDS TODAY WITHOUT A RIVAL THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL SEEN IN THE LIGHT OF RACE DEVELOPMENT GAINED AN IMPORTANCE IN POSSIBILITY NOT DREAMED OF BEFORE AND GIVES TO EDUCATION AS A MOLDING AND FORMING OF MEN A RECOGNITION WHICH EDUCATION AS THE MERE 375THE SCHOOL REVIEW IMPARTING OF INFORMATION HAD NEVER AND COULD NEVER ATTAIN EDUCATION HAS PASSED FROM MEMORYCRAMMING INTO MANMAKING AND THE TEACHER HAS PASSED FROM A DRILLMASTER INTO A PROMETHEUS A MAKER OF MEN FROM A DAY LABORER INTO AN ARTIST IT BECOMES MORE AND MORE EVIDENT THAT TO DO HIS WORK WELL DEMANDS SPECIAL SKILL AND CAREFUL PREPARATION CAN ANYONE QUESTION WHETHER THE MAN WHO IS TO HOLD SUCH A PLACE NEEDS SPECIAL PREPARATION FOR HIS WORK  HE WHO DENIES IT MUST CONFESS THAT BY HIS VERY DENIAL HE CONDEMNS EDUCATION ITSELF NO MAN CAN CONSISTENTLY ASSERT HIS FAITH IN EDUCATION AS A POWER TO MAKE BETTER MEN BETTER CITIZENS BETTER PHYSICIANS BETTER LAWYERS BETTER CLERGYMEN AND DENY ITS POWER TO MAKE BETTER TEACHERS ANY REASONABLE CONCEPTION OF EDUCATION CARRIES THIS IN ITSELF AS THE PLAINEST OF COROLLARIES YET WHILE THE NECESSITY FOR TRAINING TEACHERS FOR GRAMMAR AND PRIMARY SCHOOLS IS RECOGNIZED BY ALL UNFORTUNATELY IT IS NOT SO RECOGNIZED IN THE CASE OF THE HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE HERE THE OLD CONCEPTION THAT ANYONE IS FITTED TO TEACH IF HE KNOWS HIS SUBJECT THAT KNOWLEDGE MAKES THE TEACHER IS INTRENCHED IN ITS STRONGEST FASTNESS THE PUBLIC WHO HAVE BEEN WONT TO BOW WITH DEEP RESPECT TO THE COLLEGE GRADUATE AND WITH ONLY INDIF FERENCE TO THIS SAME COLLEGE GRADUATE TYRANT OF A CREW OF BOYS AND GIRLS IS APATHETIC AND UNOBSERVING THE MASS OF HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS NEVER HAVING KNOWN THE BENEFIT OF A SPECIAL TRAINING THEMSELVES NEVER HAVING THEMSELVES BEEN ABLE UNAIDED TO SHAKE OFF THE MERE KNOWLEDGECRAMMING CONCEPTION OF EDU CATION LOOK WITH COLDNESS OR INDIFFERENCE UPON THIS INNOVATION WHICH THREATENS TO REVOLUTIONIZE THEIR EMPIRIC REIGN BUT THE LOG ICAL NECESSITY OF THE PURPOSE THE ANALOGY OF THE LOWER SCHOOLS THE EXAMPLE OF GERMANY AND FRANCE FAR AHEAD IN THIS REGARD ARE FAST DESTROYING THE CONCEPTION THAT MERE KNOWLEDGE ALONE HOWEVER ABUNDANT IT MAY BE MAKES A GOOD TEACHER AND OUR HIGH SCHOOLS NOT MANY YEARS HENCE WILL REFUSE TO ACCEPT UNTRAINED TEACHERS LET US FOR A MOMENT CONSIDER THE WORK OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL AND OBSERVE IF WHILE TEACHERS ARE TRAINED FOR OTHER 376TRAINING OF TEACHERS FOR SECONDARY SCHOOLS SCHOOLS THE SECONDARY SCHOOL HAS ANY SPECIAL GROUND FOR EXEMPTION LET US EXAMINE IT IN THE LIGHT OF THAT HIGHEST CON CEPTION OF EDUCATION WHICH CONTAINS IN ITSELF IN UNITY BOTH KNOWLEDGE AND DEVELOPMENT THE HIGH SCHOOL PERIOD OF THE LIFE OF THE CHILD FALLS USUALLY BETWEEN THE FOURTEENTH AND THE EIGHTEENTH YEARS OF AGE THERE IS NO PERIOD OF DEVELOPMENT IN THE LIFE OF THE CHILD SAVE THAT OF THE FIRST FEW YEARS WHICH CAN FOR A MOMENT COMPARE WITH THIS IN MEANING FOR THE CHILD IT IS THE SECOND BIRTH IT IS THE BIRTH OF THE EGO THE EMOTIONS JUST NOW TRANSIENT COMING AND GOING LIKE SUMMER SHOWERS BECOME FULL AND PERSISTENT WELLING UP FROM A DEPTH OF THE SOUL UNKNOWN TO THE CHILD BEFORE THEY BEGIN THEIR AMALGAMATION INTO A CHAR ACTER THE CHILD BEFORE SUPPLE PLIANT YIELDING EASILY IN JUDG MENT EVEN THOUGH REBELLIOUS IN ACT DEMANDS FOR HIMSELF THE RIGHT OF JUDGING BODY AND MIND ALIKE SHOW AWKWARD AND UNEXPECTED FITS OF GROWTH AS THE BABE IN THE CRADLE EXPLORES HIS LIMBS AND REACHES FOR HIS TOES AND CROWS TO FIND THEM HIS AND BY THE SENSES UNITES HIMSELF IN ALL HIS PARTS INTO A BODY COR PORATESO NOW THE YOUTH EXPLORES HIMSELF IN HIS INTELLECTUAL AND MORAL NATURE HE NEVER KNEW BEFORE THAT THERE WAS AS MUCH OF HIM AS THERE REALLY IS HE IS AWKWARD IN HIS NEW POSSESSIONS SELFCONSCIOUS ABASHED HIS BRAIN FAILS TO CO6RDINATE HIS MUS CLES AS IT WAS WONT A FEW YEARS AGO HE CANNOT WALK HE CANNOT SPEAK HE CANNOT THINK WITHOUT WALKING SPEAKING AND THINKING BEING CONSCIOUS WALKING SPEAKING AND THINKING HOW SHALL HE DO THIS  WHY SHALL HE DO THAT  NO SUCH QUESTION EVER CAME TO HIM BEFORE IT IS THE AGE WHEN LIFE BEGINS TO MAKE ITS GREAT DECISIONS THAT FACE SO SMOOTH AND CHILDLIKE NOW BEGINS TO BE MARKED WITH THE HIEROGLYPHICS OF CHARACTER HERCULES IS AT THE CROSSROADS WHO SHALL HELP HIM TO DECIDE  THIS IS THE TIME WHEN THE SELFCENTERING THOUGHT OF THE CHILD TURNS TO ALTRUISM HE YEARNS TO SACRIFICE HIMSELF FOR SOMETHING TRUE SOMETHING NOBLE SOMETHING GRAND LIFE REACHES OUT TO THE STARS FOR HIM HE SEES HIMSELF WALK THE MILKYWAY OF GREATNESS WITH THE GODS HE NEVER WILL VALUE HIS LIFE MORE HIGHLY THAN NOW NEVER WILL BE MORE READY TO SACRIFICE IT TO NOBILITY AND TRUTH THAN NOW 377IHE SCHOOL REVIEW WHO IS THE MAN WHO SHALL GUIDE THIS FIERY UNTAMED SPIRIT  WHO SHALL WATCH THE OPPORTUNITY WHICH ONCE PASSED SHALL BE GONE FOREVER SHALL HE BE A QUACK AN EMPIRIC WHOSE EMPIRI CISM EVEN HAS HAD THE GROWTH OF ONLY A FEW YEARS OR SHALL HE BE A MAN WHOSE MIND IS STORED WITH ALL THAT THE GENERATIONS HAVE LEARNED AS TO LIFE AND ITS GROWTH WHOSE EYE IS QUICK TO SEE THE EXPECTED OPPORTUNITY FOR WHICH IT IS EVER WATCHING QUICK TO SEE READY TO ACT AN EXPERT TRAINED BY CAREFUL TRAINING NOW IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY IF YOU WOULD BE MENMAKERS IN THIS ARCHITECTURE OF MAN THE WORK DONE BY THE SECONDARY SCHOOL MUST OF NECESSITY BE DIVIDED AMONG SPECIALISTS AS THE PUPIL ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE THE SHORTNESS OF HUMAN LIFE AND THE LIMITATIONS OF THE HUMAN MIND FORBID THAT ONE MAN SHOULD BE A TEACHER IN MANY BRANCHES OF LEARNING NOW THE STONE CUTTER CAN HEW OUT THE KEYSTONE FOR A PORTAL AND NEVER KNOW WHERE THAT PORTAL IS TO BE WHETHER BENEATH IT A DEVOUT PEOPLE IS TO PASS TO WORSHIP AT THE HOUR OF PRAYER OR IT IS TO LOOK DOWN UPON MEN HURRYING FOR GAIN INTO A MART OF TRADE AND YET IT MAY BE A PERFECT KEYSTONE WELL HEWN EXACTLY FITTING IN ITS PLACE AND FULFILLING THE PLAN OF THE MASTER BUILDER A MAN MAV CUT WITH PRECISION THE DELICATE TEETH OF A WATCH WHEEL WITH HIS EYE UPON THE PATTERN HE MAY NEVER ERR AND WHEN HIS WHEEL IS FITTED WITH THE WHEELS MADE BY OTHER HANDS THERE MAY RESULT THE MARVELOUS HARMONY OF THE EXACT WATCH WITH MANBUILDING IN THE SCHOOLS IT IS NOT SO THE TEACHER MUST HAVE A BROAD VIEW OF THE WHOLE IN THE LIGHT OF WHICH HE SHALL DO HIS SPECIAL WORK ELSE THE WHOLE WORK MUST BE IN THE DARK AND ALAS A THING OF DARKNESS IN THIS DARKNESS WE HAVE BUILT MEN WITH ALL SORTS OF DEFORMITIES MEN WHOSE LIVES WILL ALWAYS BE NARROW RUNNING UPON CLOSESET NARROW GROOVES WITHOUT RADIATING LINES OR EVEN BROAD PARALLELS OF THOUGHT STIFFNECKED MEN WHO CANNOT TURN THEIR HEADS TO RIGHT OR LEFT WITHOUT A MENTAL REVOLUTION MEN WHO NEVER KNOW THAT THE HORIZON IS A CIRCLE AND MELTS INTO ITSELF AT EITHER END MEN WHO WITH A QUEER PENETRATING ROLL OF THE EYE BALL SEE ONLY LATIN GRAMMAR PARADIGMS OR CAN ONLY COUNT THE PETALS OF A ROSE SEE ONLY ITS MATHEMATICS AND BE BLIND TO ITS 378TRAINING OF TEACJHERS FOR SECONDARY SCHOOLS BEAUTY OR MEN WITH MATHEMATICAL EYES AND LANGUAGE EYES AND SCIENCE EYES INSTEAD OF MEN WITH EYES OF DEEPEST DEPTHS IN WHICH ALL GODS UNIVERSE MAY BE REFLECTED THE HIGHEST EDUCA TION IS A MATTER OF ESTABLISHING RELATIONS THAT TEACHER WHO HAS NEVER VIEWED THE WHOLE CAN ILL HELP TO SPIN THESE COBWEB THREADS OF RELATIONS FINER THAN THE MICROSCOPIC NERVE TRACTS LOST IN THE LABYRINTH OF THE BRAIN CORRELATE HOW CAN HE CORRELATE WHO HAS NEVER DREAMED OF SUCH AN ART MANBUILDING HOW CAN HE BUILD A MAN WHO HAS NEVER BENT HIS BROW PERHAPS FOR A SINGLE HOUR OVER THE PROBLEM OF WHAT A MAN SHOULD BE AND HOW HE CAN BE MADE TO BECOME WHAT HE SHOULD BECOME  BUT THE SECONDARY SCHOOL NOT ONLY REQUIRES TEACHERS WHO VIEW WIDELY THE ENDS OF EDUCATION RISING IN A HIERARCHY TO THAT HIGHEST ARCHITECTONIC ENDMORAL CHARACTER BUT IT REQUIRES TEACH ERS WHO ARE FULLY CONVERSANT WITH THE METHODS AND SPIRIT OF THE SCHOOLS BELOW THE HIGH SCHOOL AS LONG AS EDUCATION WAS LIKENED BY SIMILE TO THE ERECTION OF A STATELY BUILDING WHERE THE HIGHER SIMPLY RESTS UPON THE LOWER THE NECESSITY OF THIS KNOWLEDGE WAS OBSCURED BUT WHEN WE TAKE THE TRUE FIGURE THAT OF A GROW ING ORGANISM WHEN WE RECOGNIZE THAT DEVELOPMENT COMES ONLY BY THE EXPANSION OF THE OLD THAT THE NEW IS ONLY ACQUIRED BY BEING ORGANICALLY CONNECTED WITH THE OLD THEN IT IS IMPERATIVE TO KNOW WHAT THE OLD IS TO STUDY THE CONTENTS OF PUPILS MINDS ON ENTERING A SECONDARY SCHOOL AS WELL AS ON ENTERING A PRI MARY SCHOOL AND NOT TO STUDY SIMPLY THE WHAT BUT TO STUDY THE RELATIONS THE ORGANIC POTENTIALITY OF WHAT THE PUPIL ALREADY POSSESSES OR ALREADY IS THIS IS SPECIALLY TRUE OF THE BEGINNING OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL WHERE UNLESS THE TEACHER IS WISE THERE IS LIKE TO COME A BREAK WHICH SHALL DESTROY THE CON TINUITY SO ESSENTIAL TO THE HIGHEST EDUCATION THUS UPON AT LEAST THREE COUNTS THE TRAINING OF SECONDARY SCHOOLTEACHERS IS FULLY AS IMPERATIVE AS THE TRAINING OF TEACHERS FOR THE LOWER SCHOOLSTHE PECULIAR AND IMPORTANT CHARACTER OF THE CHANGES WHICH AT THAT TIME OF LIFE DEVELOP IN THE PUPIL THE NECESSITY OF GREATER SPECIALIZATION IN WORK WHICH DEMANDS THAT THE SPECIALIST SHALL SEE HIS OWN WORK IN ITS PROPER RELATION AND 379THE SCHOOL REVIEW THIRD THE FIELD OF EARLIER EDUCATION WITH WHICH THE TEACHER IN THE SECONDARY SCHOOL SHOULD BE FAMILIAR IF WE GRANT THEN THE NECESSITY FOR TRAINING TEACHERS IN THE SECONDARY SCHOOLS WE MUST CONSIDER THE PRACTICAL QUESTION IN WHAT DOES THE TRAINING PROPER FOR A SECONDARY TEACHER CONSIST  FEW OF US WOULD FEEL COMPETENT TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION ONLY THE NOVICE WOULD BE WILLING TO ANSWER IT OFFHAND TO US AS TEACHERS WHO HAVE GAINED THE ART BY LABORIOUS PRACTICE UNITED WITH WHAT OFTEN SEEMS INSPIRATION THE QUESTION IS ONE OF DOUBT AND PERPLEXITY WE FEEL OURSELVES INCLINED TO SAY WITH TOPSY THAT WE HAVE JUST GROWED THE HOW IS SO DOMINATED BY THE ELEMENT OF TIME THAT IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE TO ELIMINATE IT AND SHORTEN THOSE YEARS INTO MONTHS AND YET THAT IS WHAT TRAINING SHOULD DO IT SHOULD POINT OUT THE DIAGONAL WHERE WE HAVE LABORIOUSLY TOILED AROUND THE SIDES IT SHOULD CONDENSE EXPERI ENCE WITHOUT DIMINISHING ITS STRENGTH OR SWEETNESS TRIAL ALONE CAN FULLY SOLVE THE PROBLEM WE MAY HOWEVER BE ABLE TO SET FORTH A FEW GENERAL PRINCIPLES WHICH SHALL MEET WITH THE APPROVAL OF ALL AND SERVE AS POINTS OF STARTING FOR A CONCRETE REALIZATION OF OUR HOPES THE STORY IS THAT SOCRATES FIRST MET XENOPHON IN A NARROW LANE AND PUTTING FORTH HIS STAFF STOPPED HIM TELL ME BEGAN SOCRATES WHERE DOES A MAN BUY MEAL IN THE MARKET PLACE WAS THE ANSWER AND OIL IN THE SAME PLACE BUT WHERE DOES ONE GO TO BECOME WISE  THE YOUTH WAS SILENT  FOLLOW ME SAID THE SAGE AND I WILL TELL YOU THE GREATEST EDUCATIVE FORCE IS INDIVIDUALITY NO INFLUENCE CAN EQUAL THAT WHICH COMES FROM MASTER UPON DISCIPLE AND AS IT IS THE TRUE MAN ALONE WHO CAN BE THE TRUE TEACHER SO THE FIRST REQUISITE IN THE TEACHER IS HIMSELF TO BE A MAN AND THE FIRST PRINCIPLE WHICH SHOULD DOMINATE ALL TRAINING OF TEACHERS IS TO CULTIVATE FREEDOM IN THE INDIVIDUALITY THIS HAS BEEN THE WEAK POINT OF THE NORMAL TRAINING OF THE PAST METHOD METHOD BUT NO MAN BEHIND THE METHOD MACHINE METHODS OF TEACHING CAN ONLY MAKE MACHINE SCHOLARS THEY SAP THE VITALITY OF TEACHERS AND PUPILS ALIKE AND YET METHOD IS INDISPENSABLE TO ALL SUCCESS BUT ONLY LIVING 380TRAINING OF TEACHERS FOR SECONDARY SCHOOLS METHOD AND IN THE HANDS OF THE MAN WHO HAS ASSIMILATED IT MADE IT HIS OWN PUT HIS OWN LIFE INTO IT THE MEANING OF LIFE HERE ON EARTH SAYS CARLYLE MIGHT BE DEFINED AS CONSISTING IN THIS TO UNFOLD YOURSELF TO WORK WHAT THING YOU HAVE A FACULTY FOR IT IS A NECESSITY FOR THE HUMAN BEING THE FIRST LAW OF OUR EXISTENCE A SLAVE CAN DO ONLY A SLAVES WORK AND THERE ARE NO CHAINS SO DEBASING AS SPIRITUAL CHAINS THIS FREEDOM HOWEVER DOES NOT MEAN LICENSE BUT ONLY THIS THAT THE MIND OF THE TEACHER SHALL ALWAYS BE KEPT UPON THE END AND NOT BE SPELLBOUND IN CONTEMPLATING THE MEANS THE BEST WAY TO HIT A MARK IS TO FIX THE EYE UPON THAT AND NOT UPON THE MUSCLES WHICH MOVE THE ARM THIS PRINCIPLE OF INDIVIDUALITY IS THE LENS THROUGH WHICH WE SHOULD LOOK AT ALL OTHER DEVICES IT IS THE DIE WHICH ALONE SHOULD STAMP THE PURE GOLD OF GENUINE TEACHING THE FIRST PRINCIPLE THEN FOR THE GUIDANCE IN TRAINING IS THE SACREDNESS OF INDIVIDUALITY THE SECOND IS THE BROAD POINT OF VIEW TO OPEN TO THE TEACHER THE PROBLEM OF EDUCATION BOTH IN ITS WIDE SENSE OF THE END AND ITS NARROW SENSE OF METHOD IN SEPARATE STUDIES HE MUST LEARN THE PROBLEM OF EDUCATION FIRST SPELLING OUT THE WORDS TRACING THE LINE WITH SLOW MOVING FINGER THEN STATING IT IN ALGEBRAIC TERMS THE SOLUTION NO MAN KNOWS IT IS FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAT THE YOUNG TEACHER SHOULD HAVE A CLEAR VIEW OF WHAT THE PROBLEM IS THAN THAT HE SHOULD REVERENCE ANY MANS SOLUTION THIS FAMILIARITY CAN BE ACQUIRED ONLY BY A STUDY OF THE HISTORY OF EDUCATION HE MUST THINK THE THOUGHTS OF THE GREAT THINKERS OF EDUCATION THE THOUGHTS OF PLATO OF ARISTOTLE OF ROUSSEAU OF PESTALOZZI OF HERBART OF MANN THINK THEM AND MAKE THEM HIS OWN STRIVING TO RISE UPON THEM AS STEPPING STONES TO A TRUER SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM THAN THEY HAVE REACHED HE MUST CLASH WITH THEM CONTEND WITH THEM WRESTLE WITH THEM UNTIL THEY ARE HIS IT IS A LAMENTABLE FACT THAT IN OUR VARIED DISCUSSIONS OF EDUCATIONAL QUESTIONS SO LITTLE IS TO BE HEARD OF REFERENCE TO THE HISTORY OF EDUCATION WHAT MEN HAVE ALREADY DONE WHERE SUCCEEDED WHERE FAILED NO WONDER THAT THE SAME MISTAKES ARE REPEATED BY GENERATION AFTER GENERATION OF THINKERS 38ITHE SCHOOL REVIEW WHEN THE TORCH OF HISTORY SHEDS NO LIGHT UPON THE PRESENT THERE CAN BE LITTLE PROGRESS THIS BROAD POINT OF VIEW MUST BE AIMED AT NOT ONLY IN THE COMPREHENSIVE QUESTIONS OF EDUCATION BUT ALSO IN THE NARROWER QUESTIONS OF METHOD HERE THERE MUST BE A KNOWLEDGE OF THE PROBLEM IN ALL THE FUNDAMENTAL STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL IT IS NOT ENOUGH THAT HE BE GROUNDED IN ONE OR TWO MERELY HE CANNOT KNOW ONE PROPERLY WITHOUT KNOWING THE PRINCIPLE OF ALL THOUGH HIS WORK MUST BE INTENSIVE IN A NARROWER FIELD THE LONG DISCUSSION OF THE QUESTION OF ENGLISH HAS MADE PLAIN WHAT IN A LARGER OR SMALLER SENSE IS TRUE OF EVERY STUDY THAT IT IS INDIS SOLUBLY LINKED WITH EVERY OTHER STUDY AND THAT STORM AGAINST CONCENTRATION IN THE HERBARTIAN SENSE AS WE WILL CONCENTRATION IS UPON US NOT AN EXOTIC TRANSPLANTED FROM THE JUNGLE GROWTH OF GERMAN PHILOSOPHY BUT A CONCENTRATION OF INDIGENOUS GROWTH NATIVE TO HARDHEADED PRACTICAL NEW ENGLAND THE THIRD PRINCIPLE IS THE PRINCIPLE OF CONTINUITY THE YOUNG TEACHER MUST LEARN THAT THE WORK OF EDUCATION IS A CONTINUOUS ONE THAT IT BEGINS WITH THE CRADLE AND ABOVE ALL THAT IN THE EARLY YEARS OF THE CHILD THE PROBLEM IS PRESENTED IN A FORM BEST FOR THE LEARNING AND OBSERVATION OF THE FUTURE TEACHER THANKS TO THE LABORS OF THE PIONEER REFORMERS TO THE MARTYRS FOR POPULAR EDUCATION THE WORK OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOLS HAS BEEN PUT IN A POSITION WHERE IT MAY SERVE AS A MODEL FOR TEACHERS OF ALL GRADES THESE MEN WERE SATURATED WITH THE TRUE LOVE OF HUMANITY WHEN IT IS THE PRAYER OF EVERY TEACHER THAT THE MANTLE OF THESE ELIJAHS SHALL FALL UPON HIM WHEN EVERY TEACHER SHALL BOW IN REVERENCE AND LOVE BEFORE THE LITTLE CHILD SET IN THEIR MIDST THEN WILL COME A MILLENNIUM ITS ROSYFINGERED DAWN HAS ALREADY TOUCHED THE SKY THE HERALD OF BRIGHTER DAY AND SO I WOULD SAY SEND YOUR TEACHERS FOR THE SECONDARY SCHOOLS TO THE KINDER GARTEN LET THEM GIVE CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE EARLY WORK IN THE PRIMARY SCHOOLS THERE THEY MAY SEE TEACHING FREE FROM ALL TEMPTATION TO PEDANTRY WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF RIVALRY BETWEEN TEACHER AND TAUGHT TEACHING IN WHICH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE TEACHER SO FAR PASSES THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PUPIL THAT THE HOW OF METHOD MAY REIGN SUPREME 382TRAINING OF TEACHERS FOR SECONDARY SCHOOLS BUT WHATEVER THE TRAINING UPON THE SIDE OF KNOWING THERE MUST BE THE RICHEST OF TRAINING ON THE SIDE OF DOING THIS TRAIN ING MUST NOT CONSIST OF A LESSON HERE AND THERE BUT THERE MUST BE CONTINUOUS WORK WITH CLASSES COVERING LONG INTERVALS OF TIME THAT THE TEACHER MAY LEARN TO HAVE THAT GRIP UPON SUBJECT AND CLASS WHICH IS THE MARK OF THE SUCCESSFUL TEACHER THE STUDENT TEACHER MUST GO INTO HIS CLASS ROOM ALONE WITH HIS CLASS AND SHUT THE DOOR SUCH AN EXPERIMENT IN TRAINING TEACHERS BY PRACTICE HAS BEEN CONDUCTED FOR TWO YEARS PAST IN THE PROVIDENCE HIGH SCHOOL AND HAS MET WITH SUCCESS AS FAR AS CAN BE JUDGED IN SO SHORT A TIME EIGHT STUDENTTEACHERS WERE IN TRAINING EACH YEAR AND TEN HAVE BEEN APPOINTED FOR NEXT YEAR THESE STUDENT TEACHERS ARE COLLEGE GRADUATES WHO HAVE TAKEN THE COURSE IN PEDAGOGY AT BROWN DURING THE PREVIOUS YEAR A COURSE OF THREE HOURS A WEEK COVERING A STUDY OF THE HISTORY THEORY AND PRAC TICE OF EDUCATION THESE STUDENTTEACHERS WHO ARE AT THE SAME TIME PURSUING A GRADUATE COURSE IN PEDAGOGY AT BROWN ARE ASSIGNED TO HALFTIME WORK IN THE HIGH SCHOOL AND RECEIVE HALF PAY FOR THEIR SERVICES EACH IS ASSIGNED FULL CONTROL OF CLASSES IN AT LEAST TWO BRANCHES OF STUDY TO THE PUPIL THEY STAND IN EXACTLY THE SAME RELATION AS FULLY QUALIFIED TEACHERS BUT BEHIND THE SCENES THEY ARE ASSIGNED TO THE SPECIAL SUPERVISION AND GUID ANCE OF SUPERVISINGTEACHERS WHO IN GENERAL ARE THE HEADS OF DEPARTMENTS THEY ARE ASSIGNED CLASSES WHICH ARE DOING WORK PARALLEL TO THAT OF SOME EXPERIENCED TEACHER WHO SETS THE PACE FOR THEIR MOVEMENTS AND SERVES AS A GUIDING EXAMPLE EACH SUPERVISINGTEACHER MEETS IN CONFERENCE ONCE A WEEK THE STU DENTTEACHERS IN HIS DEPARTMENT AND AS EACH STUDENTTEACHER IS ASSIGNED TO AT LEAST TWO DEPARTMENTS HE WILL HAVE TWO CONFER ENCES EACH WEEK THESE ARE INFORMAL MEETINGS AND ARE THE SUM MING UP OF THE EXPERIENCES AND OBSERVATIONS OF THE WEEK BESIDES THIS THERE IS A MEETING ONCE A WEEK WHEN THE THREADS OF THE WORK ARE GATHERED TOGETHER BY THE DIRECTOR OF THE TRAINING DEPARTMENT WHO IS ALSO PROFESSOR OF PEDAGOGY IN BROWN UNI VERSITY ONCE A WEEK THERE IS A SEMINARY IN METHODS LED BY THE SUPERVISING TEACHERS OF THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS AT WHICH 383THE SCHOOL REVIEW ALL THE STUDENTTEACHERS ARE PRESENT AND AS PREPARATION FOR WHICH A LARGE AMOUNT OF READING AND OBSERVATION IS ASSIGNED A STU DENTTEACHER THUS IS NOT CONFINED TO A KNOWLEDGE OF METHOD IN THE DEPARTMENT IN WHICH HE IS DOING INTENSIVE WORK BUT STUDIES ALSO THE PROBLEM IN ALL THE LEADING BRANCHES OF SECONDARY SCHOOL WORKLATIN GREEK FRENCH ENGLISH HISTORY MATHEMATICS PHYSICS CHEMISTRY THUS A BROAD FOUNDATION IS LAID FOR THE INTENSIVE WORK ONCE A WEEK ALSO A SEMINARY IS CONDUCTED BY THE PROFESSOR OF PEDAGOGY OF BROWN FOR THE THOROUGH STUDY OF PARTICULAR SUB JECTS CHOSEN FOR EACH QUARTER THUS HERBARTIAN PEDAGOGY CHILD STUDY INCLUDING THE PERIOD OF ADOLESCENCE SCHOOL HYGIENE EDUCATIONAL VALUES ETC AT THE SAME TIME EACH STUDENTTEACHER IS ASSIGNED A THEME FOR A THESIS TO REPRESENT CAREFUL MASTERY OF THAT SUBJECT THROUGH READING EXPERIMENT AND OBSERVATION THE STUDENTTEACHER IS EXPECTED AT THIS POINT TO REACH THE FRONTIER OF THOUGHT AND PENETRATE A LITTLE WAY HOWEVER SMALL INTO THE REGIONS OF HITHERTO UNKNOWN TRUTH THE PRIME PURPOSE OF THE HIGH SCHOOL IN UNDERTAKING THIS WORK IS TO SECURE TRAINED TEACHERS AND RAISE THE PROFESSIONAL SPIRIT OF ITS TEACHING CORPS THE STUDENTTEACHERS UNDERTAKE THE WORK WITH THE HOPE OF SECURING GOOD PREPARATION AS TEACHERS AND GOOD PLACES AS A RESULT AND IN THIS THEY HAVE NOT BEEN DISAPPOINTED IN THEIR LAST ANNUAL REPORT TO THE CITY GOVERNMENT THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE OF PROVIDENCE SAY THE SCHEME HAS PROVED A VALUABLE ONE BOTH TO THE YOUNG TEACHERS WHO THEMSELVES WERE GAINING IN THE MOST READY AND THOROUGH WAY EXPERIENCE IN TEACHING AND TO THE MORE CAPABLE TEACHERS OF THE HIGH SCHOOL WHO BY THE NECESSITY OF EXPLAINING PROCESSES MAKING CLEAR THE APPLICATION OF PRINCIPLES AND EXPOUNDING THE PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO RENDER ORDERLY AND COMPACT THE PRINCIPLES ALREADY ADOPTED BY THEM FOR THE GOVERN MENT OF THEIR OWN WORK THE GENERAL PROFESSIONAL TONE OF THE SCHOOL HAS BEEN IMPROVED AND IT IS THE REPORT OF THE PRINCIPALS OF THE DEPARTMENTS THAT THESE YOUNG PERSONS HAVE DONE BETTER WORK THAN ANY AVERAGE TEACHER WITHOUT EXPERIENCE THAT HAS BEEN EMPLOYED IN OUR HIGH SCHOOL FOR MANY YEARS PAST 384TRAINING OF TEACHERS FOR SECONDARY SCHOOLS FROM THIS LIST OF TRAINED TEACHERS VACANCIES IN OUR SCHOOLS OCCURRING IN REGULAR POSITIONS MAY BE FILLED IN THIS WAY WE HOPE TO SECURE A HIGHER GRADE OF TEACHING MORE PROFESSIONAL AMBITION AND A BETTER ADAPTATION TO OUR SCHOOL WORK THAN WE HAVE YET BEEN ABLE TO DO IN PRESENTING THIS ARTICLE THE IDEA IS NOT TO ADVOCATE THIS PAR TICULAR PLAN BUT TO MAKE AN EARNEST PLEA FOR THE PROFESSIONAL TRAINING OF TEACHERS FOR SECONDARY SCHOOLS INTO THESE SCHOOLS COME THOSE WHO ARE TO BE THE LEADERS IN THOUGHT AND ACTION IN OUR LAND AND TOGETHER WITH THEM THE SONS OF THE GREAT MIDDLE CLASS OF CITIZENS THE WORK IS NOT TO BE DONE UPON BASE METAL BUT UPON THE FINEST METAL THE MINDS OF OUR COUNTRY CAN PRODUCE IT IS FOOLISH TO TRUST THIS WORK TO THE HANDS OF UNSKILLED WORK MEN TO THE CHINESE LABOR OF IMITATION OUR YOUNG HIGHSCHOOL TEACHERS UNTRAINED ENTER UPON THEIR WORK WITH ENTHUSIASM THEY ARE MEN OF SCHOLARSHIP AND CHARACTER BUT IN ALMOST EVERY INSTANCE THEIR METHODS ARE DETERMINED BY THE METHODS OF THAT TEACHER WHO IN PREPARING THEM FOR COLLEGE IMPRESSED THEM MOST THEY ARE ABOUT EIGHT YEARS BEHIND THE TIMES THEIR MEMORY OF METHODS INTO THE RATIONALE OF WHICH THEY WERE NEVER INDUCTED IS DIM AND SUPERFICIAL WITH THEIR BRIGHT HOPES AND ASPIRATIONS UNGUIDED THEY SOON IN TOO MANY CASES SUFFER ARRESTED GROWTH AND FALL INTO THE HUMDRUM OF MECHANICAL TEACHING THE FOUR WALLS OF THE SCHOOLROOM ARE AS OPAQUE TO THEIR SPIRITUAL AS TO THEIR PHYSICAL VISION TEACHING BECOMES DISTASTEFUL TO THEM A MERE FORM OF MONEY GETTING THEY BECOME MENTAL DYSPEPTICS AND IF PHYSICAL DYSPEPSIA IS NOT CONTAGIOUS SPIRITUAL IS CER TAINLY MOST VIRULENTLY SO GOD PITY THE PUPILS WHAT WE NEED IN OUR HIGH SCHOOLS IS MENMAKERS TEACHERS WITH THE HIGHEST CONCEPTION OF THEIR CALLING MEN WHO WILL LOOK UPON IT AS A LIFE WORK BECAUSE OF THE GREAT AMOUNT OF GOOD IN THE WORLD THEY CAN ACCOMPLISH DOES IT DEMAND SACRIFICE  THE NOBLEST WILL SACRI FICE THE BEST FOR A NOBLE WORK DOES SOCIETY LOOK WITH DISTRUST UPON THE PRACTICAL WISDOM OF THE TEACHER  LET THE TEACHER BE WORTHY OF TRUST AND IT WILL BE GRANTED HIM IS TEACHING NOT NUMBERED FIT TO BE NAMED WITH THE HONORED TRINITY OF PROFES SIONS  IT HAS BEEN THE TEACHERS FAULT THEY HAVE OUTSTRIPPED 385386 THE SCHOOL REVIEW HIM IN THE RACE LET THE LICENSE TO TEACH AS IT WAS THE FIRST DEGREE TO BE CONFERRED BY A UNIVERSITY BE THE MOST HONORED THE FIELD IS RIPE FOR REAPING IT IS THE CONSENSUS OF OPINION THAT TEACHING OUGHT TO BE A PROFESSION THAT ITS WORK IN IMPOR TANCE IS SECOND TO NONE THAT WHILE THE OTHER PROFESSIONS RESTORE MEDICINE TO HEALTH LAW TO JUSTICE THEOLOGY TO RIGHTEOUSNESS TEACHING IS THE SCIENCE BY WHICH EVIL IS ANTICIPATED BY PRE VENTION BY WHICH THE BAD NEVER EXISTS BECAUSE OF THE DEVELOP MENT OF THE GOOD OF ALL THE IMPERATIVE NEEDS OF EDUCATION TODAY THE NEED OF LEADERS IS THE GREATEST IF WE CANNOT BE LEADERS OURSELVES LET US TRAIN THOSE WHO SHALL BE LEADERS THAT BY THE STRENGTH OF OUR PURPOSES AND THROUGH OUR LABOR AND TOILS EDUCATION MAY BE EXALTED UPON THAT THRONE OF HONOR TO WHICH ALL WITH SPONTANEOUS EDICT DECLARE HER ENTITLED WALTER BALLOU JACOBS BROWN UNIVERSITY

issuing of county bonds for the permanent road or bridge im provement in the Magisterial Districts of the Counties of the State approved February 25th 1908 Session Acts 1908 page 71 has recently arisen in this section which is of such general importance to the State at large that I think it deserves consideration in your columns Sec tion 2 of the Act contains this clause The Judges of Election at the several voting precincts shall im mediately after the closing of the polls at each of the said places count the ballots deposited and shall within two days after said elec tion make returns thereof as provided in other elections provided that no voter shall be allowed to vote in said election who resides and is a voter in a town exempt from road tax Section 7 of the Act provides as follows After issuing such bonds or any of them when next levy is made or tax imposed in said County a tax shall be levied on all of the property liable to State tax in said Magisterial District in which the proceeds of the bonds have been or are to be expended to pay the interest on the bonds so is sued and to create a sinking fund to redeem the principal thereof at maturity etc The question is has the Legislature the constitutional right to delegate to a part of the voters of a District the question of borrow ing money and issuing bonds to secure the same and at the same time provide that if the election is in favor of the bond issue the property in the whole District shall be taxed to pay the same For instance the Town of Jonesville in Lee County Virginia is a separate Road District and is exempt from taxation for road purposes in the County at large An election will be held in Lee County to morrow on the question of a bond issue in the Jonesville Magisterial District as well as in the other Districts in the County Under  2 of the Act the people in Jonesville have no right to vote upon the question Yet under  7 of the Act if the election is favorable to the bond issue a tax to pay the bonds and interest thereon must be levied on all property liable to State tax in such Magisterial Dis trict Is not this taxation without representation Section 6 of the Bill of Rightsprovides as follows Section 6 Elections to Be FreeThat all elections ought to be free and that all men having sufficient evidence ofpermanent com mon interest with and attachment to the community have the right of suffrage and cannot be taxed or deprived of or damaged in their property for public uses without their own consent or that of their 1909 729730 14 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Jan representatives duly elected or bound by any law to which they have hot in like manner assented for the public good The Act in question seems to be in conflict with this provision of the constitution The people in Jonesville for instance if the election carries will be taxed without their consent or that of their repre sentatives duly elected It is a general principle that the Legislature cannot delegate the taxing power See Cooley on Taxation 3rd Ed pages 99 to 105 To this general principle however there are certain wellrecognized exceptions For instance it is universally held that the Legislature can delegate the taxing power to municipal corporations for town and city purposes and to the Board of Supervisors for County pur poses It is also settled that the Legislature has full supervision of the Counties of the State and that it can authorize a bond issue with out leaving the question to the local authorities It will be observed however that in the present case the Legisla ture has not itself passed on the questionit has not decided for in stance that Lee County shall or shall not borrow money for road purposes and issue bonds to pay therefor So likewise it has not left this question to the Board of Supervisors of Lee Countty It has delegated its power to the voters of Lee County but in so doing has expressly provided that a part of the voters of the County shall not vote upon the question Coming back now to  6 of the Bill of Rights it willbe seen that the tax in question if levied will be without the consent of the rcprcscntatizes of the people of Lee and the Act will therefore be unconstitutional unless it can be shown that the said tax is with their own consent Can the tax be said to be with the consent of the people when only a part of them are allowed to vote on this question If so it would seem that the Legislature had the right to provide that any county should be taxed for road purposes court house purposes or any other purpose provided the majority of those voting at an election favored the tax and at the same time to pro vide that only one Magisterial District in the County might vote on the subject or that only the people in one small town or crossroads in the County might vote thereon Such an act would be so unjust that if there is not there certainly ought to be some provision in the constitution which would prohibit it I believe that  6 of the Bill of Rights above quoted does prohibit it Nevertheless there is one decision in Virginia which may be con sidered as upholding the constitutionality of such an act I refer to Langhorne and Scott v Robinson 20 Gratt 661 It appears from this case that the Legislature had passed an act authorizing the Common Council of Lynchburg to guarantee the payment of interest on cer tain bonds of the Lynchburg and Tennessee Railroad Company andCORRESPONDENCE further provided that to meet the guaranty the council should have power to assess taxes upon all lands and property within the City and also upon all property for half mile round the city The court upheld the constitutionality of the Act and expressly held that it did not violate  6 of the Bill of Rights The Court said The tax being thus imposed by the power and authority of the Legislature alone it follows that it might as well be delegated to local authorities who do not represent the people as having been elected by them The Court further held that the Town Council of Lynchburg in acting un der this act did not act as a Town Council but acted as Special Agents selected by the Legislature If this decision be correct it would seem to follow that the Legislature could leave the question of whether a county should or should not issue bonds and levy taxes to pay the same to any private individual of the State no matter who he might be yet this would be so clearly contrary to almost all the authorities that it would seem that this decision must be erroneous I believe that the falacy of the decision lies in the statement of the Court above quoted The tax being thus imposed by the power and authority of the Legislature alone As a matter of fact the tax was not imposed by the Legislaturethe Legislature did not determine the questionit simply left the question to the said special agents to be by them determined As I understand several of the Counties in the State have already voted on the question of issuing bonds to improve roads under the Act of 1908 and a number of others are preparing to do so The question is therefore one of vital interest and I hope you will give your own opinion thereon and also invite the opinion of other members of the bar J F BULLITT We have read with much interest the above communication and would be glad to have the opinions of any members of the bar as to the constitutionality of this act Two points however one on each side of this question occur to us which may aid somewhat in the solution of the difficulty One is that  7 provides that after issuing the bonds etc a tax shall be levied on all of the property liable to state tax etc but these persons making the complaint are expressly exempted by  2 from the paymeht of any road tax If they are ex empted from a road tax could a tax be levied or imposed on them to pay the interest on bonds issued for road improvement The other is that the case of Langhorne v Robinson 20 Gratt 661 which is cited to sustain the constitutionality of the act was expressly over ruled by the Supreme Court of Appeals in Robinson v City of Nor folk 14 Va Law Reg 292 1909 731

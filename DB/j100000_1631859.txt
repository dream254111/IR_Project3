made for the purpose of conducting original investigations in all branches of agricultural science and that those institutions and investigators that draw from the funds keep before them the obliga tion under which they are placed when they accept the conditions of the funds There is I think a certain class of workers in the experiment stations who fear that the work under the Adams Fund will prove too tech nically scientific and therefore seem to think that greater latitude should be accorded each station in the use of its pro rata of the funds During the many years that experiment stations have existed in this country with few exceptions they have done mostly demonstra tive work and results have necessarily been empirical and admitted only of local applica tion Many of them have spent their time and energy farming and making special ex periments with fads trying to eradicate  fogy notions  about the effect of the dark and light nights on planting ordinary farm crops or satisfying any popular belief The demands that have arisen from time to time among the farmers especially the southern farmers have been of this nature and have determined in a great measure the progress of some of the stations Even now we sometimes hear argu ments to the effect that experiment station work should never overshoot the heads of the average farmers and even in scientific work we should try to simplify the work so the farmer can understand it I am by no means a favorer of anything928 SCIENCE N S VOL XXVII No 702 done at experiment stations that does not eventually redound to the good of the farmer but at the same time I would have upper most in mind what really benefits the farmer not so much what he thinks benefits him Institutions of this kind are organized for the purpose of deriving farreaching conclusions and the schemes to be worked out should be determined by those who have made a deep study of agriculture in its broadest sense and not by those who have had handed down to them the ideas they daily put in practise Agriculture is the greatest of all vocations at least of all industries and yet it is only re cently that science has been directed along agricultural lines and it has probably been well for the work that the above conditions have existed In the first place there were few men who were prepared to undertake the work And second appropriations have been hard to get It is now twenty years since the organiza tion of experiment stations and a new era of progress and possibility is upon us and we should dismantle ourselves of the old robes of skepticism in regard to agricultural sci ences Some of the stations have always had high ideals many of them have been border ing the scientific phase of agriculture for a good many years but others have always held and still hold to the idea that they must busy themselves trying to satisfy the immediate demands of an uneasy public Stations that do not busy themselves with the fundamental laws of agricultural science may always expect to have this kind of work to do for the farmer finds out what is wrong before such stations are able to give out something more prom ising In that case the farmer is the leader instead of the stations This condition was seen and fully contem plated by Mr Adams when he introduced a bill to increase the annual appropriations for the national and state experiment stations else the special clause providing for a specific phase of station work would never have been incorporated in the bill If all stations had conformed to the high ideal that some of them have always maintained it would never have occurred to him that the funds must be set aside for research work He knew as we all know that the practical side of station work is indispensable not only to the good of the farmers of the states but to the theoretical work as well and feeling as I have intimated before that many of them were depending altogether on this phase of the work he set about to raise the standard by specifying that the new funds must be used to prosecute orig inal research work and to make his purpose carry he had the funds put into the hands of the Secretary of Agriculture whose duty it is to see that the said funds shall not be misspent By vitrtue of these limitations it becomes the duty of those who enter into the work to confine themselves strictly to the scientific phase of agricultural work If they carry out the original purpose of the funds they must in the course of their work hit upon the basic or fundamental principles that in the end determine real progress The day of experi mentation must yield to the inevitable day of investigation and the investigator must not undertake a diversity of projects but work along narrow lines that he may be fully able to concentrate his mind on the purely tech nically scientific phase of his work In fact there is little room to doubt that a project is admitted under the provision of the funds only as the investigator interprets it from the standpoint of science It may have practical application but must be scientific It may be work on old themes but it must be a new phase of them In view of the considerable confusion brought about by the use of the Adams Fund at the stations I wish to emphasize that no greater mistake can be made than to preach immediate application of results from those who are working under it This was not con templated by Mr Adams Farmers have to be educated gradually to an acceptance of any valuable scientific truth in agriculture and to persuade them that they should keep abreast with men of science is to demoralize them in the extreme and fill their minds with skep ticism When larger truths have become feas ible the farmers will be the ones to reap the benefit and until they have become feasibleJUNE 12 1908 SClENCE 929 let them be confined to the scientific workers The man or institution that has not already begun to lay broad foundations may well be considered among the condemned Only those who have the true spirit of investigation will win out under the Adams Fund Instead of winning out by popularity they will win out in spite of popularity if they must work for popularity Being able to reduce science to the popular is no indication of success whether it be astronomy meteorology physiol ogy pathology botany bacteriology medicine or whatnot The fact that any truth becomes popular in any degree should be because of its broad application and should and generally does bespeak years of sacrifice on the part of some investigator Whatever is worthy to be called truth is worthy the best there is in us and especially should this be so in agricultural science where results will benefit almost the whole of the human

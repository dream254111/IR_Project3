University The woman suffrage movement in Great Britain has rendered a service for political science of which even its adherents are often unaware It has brought to a most searching test the pre vailing constitutional theory In these days of psychoanalysis of the individual there should be also some psychoanalysis of political institutions Political theory like the pious formulas with which we drape the nudity of our real desires and aspirations is often at bottom what might be called a highly intellectualized excuse Political theory is an afterthought a justification or explanation of the desires and aspirations of the dominant economic and social group The divine right of kings is now a hollow pretension to us But it was as much a reality to the aristocracy whose power is explained and excused as are our own instinctive per sonal excuses The natural rights of man have proven hardly more substantialthe great excuse in which the rising commer cial classes have ever covered their designs against the aris tocracy And now at last in the theory that labor creates all wealth we find the embryo excuse for a growing threat of the working class Of course in all these cases it is not the excuse that is of inter est to the political scientists as much as it is the facts which occasion it The man who goes through life thinking that explanations are the real stuff of things is skating on thin ice indeed And so likewise is the student of politics who takes with equal seriousness the prevailing constitutional theory 284WOMAN SUFFRAGE IN PARLIAMENT 285 Now there are two such theories in regard to governmental supremacy in books on English constitutional law The one to which only the characteristic English reverence for age is now attached is that the king is the source of all law and authority parliament merely an advisory council All statutes passed by parliament today render lip service to this ancient tradition They begin Be it enacted by the kings or queens most excellent majesty by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal and commons in this present parlia ment assembled and by the authority of the same as follows The other theory is that the house of commons is the supreme governing body of the empire The one is the historic excuse of hereditary aristocracy the other is the explanation of the com mercial class for its later domination Most people recognize that the first is a hollow phrase but the second is continually extolled as a noble reality The sovereignty of Parliament says Dicey is the dominant characteristic of our political institutions James Bryce writes The British House of Commons has grown to the stature of a supreme executive as well as legislative council acting not only by its properly legislative power but through its right to displace ministers by a resolution of want of confidence and to compel the sovereign to employ such ser vants as it approves Professor Slater has phrased the the ory even better In theory the Government of England needs only the last steps toward adult suffrage with single voting and equal electoral districts should be taken in order for it to become perfectly democratic The Representative Chamber is now supreme the candidates expound their political views to the electors and the electors select the candidate whose opinions and motives with regard to legislation and administration are most in accord with their own The majority in the electorate thus is represented by the majority in the House of Commons and the leaders of the latter majority form the Cabinet Each Cabinet minister is subject to the control of the House of Com I A V Dicey Lectures on the Law and the Constitution p 35 2 Bryce American Commonwealth 1910 vol 1 p

again collectively respon sible to the peoples representatives While they thus indirectly control administration they directly control legislation3 Perhaps the most extreme and at the same time concise state ment of this theory was made by the Duke of Devonshire on September 5 1893 in a speech delivered in the house of lords during the debates on the second home rule bill He said In the United Kingdom Parliament is supreme not only in its legislative but in its executive functions Parliament makes and unmakes our ministries it revises their actions Minis tries may make peace and war but they do so at pain of instant dismissal by Parliament from office and in affairs of internal administration the power of Parliament is equally direct It can dismiss a ministry if it is too extravagant or too economical it can dismiss a ministry because its government is too stringent or too lax It does actually and practically in every way di rectly govern England Scotland and Ireland4 The supremacy of a governing body implies two things first that no higher political power can override its acts and second that it is free to act as it wills That the house of commons meets the first implication of supremacy no one today denies But the purpose of this paper is to show that it may not meet the second It is a wellknown method of the psychoanalyst to determine the patients real characteristics of mind by an elaborate system of catching him off his guardin dreams in the little inadver tencies of life in his slips of tongue or pen It is well likewise for the political analyst to catch the particular institution he is studying so to speak off its guard If he wants to uncover realities from the decorative dross of pompous declamation he must watch the subject in its daily workingsnot as reflected in the studied excuses of academic apologists The best train ing for the political scientist is campaigning for a popular cause 3Slater The Making of Modern England Revised Ed

where practical politics begin Votes for Women caught the parliamentary system off its guard The revelation which followed was damaging to the theory of parliamentary supremacy It raised the issue at least of cabinet autocracy The question for us then is does the commons control the cabinet as we are told by the constitutional theorists or does the cabinet control the commons and through it reign supreme5 A review of the Votes for Women movement in parliament pre sents as strong a line of evidence in the case as could be garnered from any one source It is claimed by suffrage supporters that there has been a clear majority of the members of the house of commons in favor of womens suffrage since 1886 There is no data at hand that will stand the test of nonpartisan relia bility to prove this contention But we have an astonishing story of persistent and continuing efforts to pass suffrage bills spread on the records of the house of commons from the year 1866 to the opening days of the great wara story which goes far in that direction That these efforts resulted as early as 1897 in the conversion of at least onethird of the total member ship of the house to suffrage is attested by the passage of an en franchisement bill on its second reading in that year by a vote of 228 to 1576 I do not discuss the house of lords in connection with either the broad prob lem of cabinet autocracy or its byproduct in the history of the suffrage move ment because with two unimportant exceptions all suffrage activity has been confined to the lower house and because under the new status of the upper house it could not block a public bill passed by three successive sessions of com mons during a period of two years 6 The steps in the passage of a bill through the house of commons are as fol lows 1 Introduction and first reading This is usually a mere formality the title only is read and it is rarely even put to vote 2 Second reading This takes place after a debate on the principle and general terms of the bill and a vote as to whether it shall be so read 3 Committee stage A bill passed on its second reading goes to either a standing committee or a special committee or to the whole membership sitting as a committee of the whole for detailed con sideration and amendment 4 Report The bill so amended is reported to the house and debated in detail 5 Third reading This final stage is similar to the second reading288 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW In 1906 a clear majority of the party in power to whom the government of the day is supposed by the theory of parliamen tary supremacy to be responsible went on record in favor of suffrage In 1910 the officially recorded proportion of support ers was raised to within 36 of onehalf the total membership of 670 and that on a day when 181 members were absenta ma jority of 109 which was greater than the government could obtain in the passage of those measures to which it was definitely committed7 As early as 1906 Mr Keir Hardie declared with out contradiction on the floor of the house that no less than 420 members were definitely pledged to vote for suffrage8 A suf frage bill was passed through two readings as far back as 1870 and since that time no less than six more bills have been similarly passed some with overwhelming majorities Yet no cabinet has agreed to make of one a government measure9 there has never been an opportunity even to register a vote on a final reading and no bill has been made into the law of the land1 In other words there has been on the one side a rising tide of suffrage sentiment that has in thirty years swept with it what is perhaps a clear majority of the house and at least a clear ma jority of the party in power and on the other a cabinet which unlike Canute of old has rolled back the tidal wave It was no 7 It might be claimed that all the absentees opposed suffrage and yet did not want to incur the enmity of the suffragist forces by voting against it While this is no doubt true in some cases an investigation of the number of absentees on days when the most important bills of the session were given a second reading dis closes at least 100 absentonly 81 less than the absentees at the suffrage bill vote See Whitakers Almanack 1911 pp 155159 It is altogether probable that among the number were more than a few supporters of the measure 8 164 Parliamentary Debates 4th series 572 9 A government measure is a bill proposed by a member of the cabinet and backed in its passage by the cabinets power 10 It may be claimed that the affirmative vote on a suffrage bill is not an accurate test of suffrage sentiment because some opponents of the cause might vote in favor of the measure to gain in popularity knowing that the bill would be finally blocked by the cabinet This claim has no positive evidence that I have discovered to support it At all events it is impossible in a survey of legislative votes to delve into the field of the members motives Such a procedure must in the nature of things be largely conjectureWOMAN SUFFRAGE IN PARLIAMENT 289 such breakwater against the sentiment of the house that the Duke of Devonshire pictured in his speech on the home rule bill or that Bryce and Dicey describe in their theory of the English constitution The cabinet to them was rather a waterwheel sensitive to the ebb and flow of parliamentary discussion and opinion grinding out the executive and legislative policy of the English nation In fact the record of suffrage discloses the out lines of a body more subtle more mobile more intelligent than a breakwater though perhaps none the less resistless an almost perfect and dominating political machine The history of the woman suffrage movement in parliament then reveals the inadequacy of the common constitutional theory But it does more it throws a flood of light on the daily operations of the machine that bids fair to be the theorys undoing The cabinet opposition to suffrage has required the expert manipulation of a complicated political engine It has left no time for the tenuous explanations of constitutional theory Let us then study the actual mechanism at hand and go to the school of practical political engineering for our principles of political science The fire of womens rights kindled by Mary Wollstonecraft in the closing days of the eighteenth century fanned by the work of women in the anticorn law agitation of the forties and heightened by Florence Nightingales inspiring service in the Crimean war was by 1865 all but beyond the control of its selfappointed masculine wardens In 1866 we find the first record of political pressure in parliament in favor of parliamen tary votes for women It is altogether fitting that the father of the votes for women struggle in parliament should have been that incarnate spirit of candor and understanding the leading political scientist of the dayJohn Stuart Mill On the 7th of June 1866 Mill who had been elected to parliament in 1865 rose in his place in the house and presented the first suffrage 11 The suffrage movement has been entirely directed to gaining votes for members of parliament Women were given the same right

signed by 1499 names which had been all collected in a fortnight12 Petitions were formerly read and given considerable attention in the house although they are now merely filed with the clerk as a matter of routine Mills pe tition however even at that time was taken by those chival rous men of the world his colleagues in a spirit of condescending goodhumor Its practical effect on the house was nilwhich of course but increased the unrest of women In 1867 an amendment was introduced to the governments reform bill in favor of womens suffragethe first record of ac tual legislation attempted in the cause The measure was de feated of course but by a vote of 196 to 73 The minority vote showed a surprisingly large section of the house in favor of suf frage and led to renewed activity on the part of its supporters3 The flames of discontent however were soon to be fanned to greater fury The act of 1867 extended the suffrage to any man instead of male person as in the law of 1832 who fulfilled certain property requirements4 Considering themselves part of the race of man and basing their contention on a law that in all acts words importing masculine gender shall be deemed to include females5 no less than 5346 women in Manchester 1341 in Salford 239 in Edinburgh and hundreds more in other cities secured a place for their names on the registers by the election officers consent and proceeded to cast their votes in the following election But in the famous case of Chorlton v Lings this unseemly conduct was given a severe judicial reproof All the votes were thrown out and the word man held to have an exclusively masculine connotation1 From 1867 to 1913 the suffrage question has been before every parliament that has sat at Westminster and with one exception 1880 there has been a determined effort made to bring a vote 12 Blackburn Record of Womens Suffrage pp 5356 13 187 Hansards Parliamentary Debates 3d series 817845 Blackburn op cit pp 6163 14 Lowell

introduction of the first womens suffrage bill Drafted by Dr Pankhurst later to become the husband of Mrs Emmeline Pankhurst the bill reached its second reading on the 4th of May Gladstone who was strong ly opposed to the whole movement anticipated no show of strength in its favor and exerted no pressure against it To his astonishment however the bill was carried by the overwhelm ing majority of 124 to 9117 The government at once asked for a delay and eight days later it came up before the house sitting as a committee of the whole Meanwhile the cabinet had brought all the pressure at its command to bear on mem bers of the majority to vote against it A motion was at once made to table the bill indefinitely When the motion came to a vote it was carried 220 to 9418 In those eight days approximately 99 members who did not consider it worth their while to be present at the earlier second reading were on hand to vote against the bill and 30 members thought better of their position and voted down their original conviction In 1871 1872 and 1873 suffrage bills were introduced In 1871 a motion to read a second time was defeated by 220 to 151 in 1872 the bill was rejected at the second reading 222 to 142 and in 1873 likewise by 222 to 15519 The figures indicate that since 1870 the party majority had remained intact under continuing cabinet pressure while the adherents of the bill

had in 1873 announced himself as in favor of womens suffrage20 he failed to make it a government measure Evidently the cabinet was too much divided on the matter for him to be willing to risk his ministry by forcing an introduction in that way At all events in 1874 the pressure of government business was too great to reserve a day21 in 1875 the bill was rejected by 187 to 152 in 1876 after an impassioned speech by John Bright against its adoption it was again defeated 236 to 152 in 1877 there was such an uproar in the opposition as to drown out every speaker in favor of the bill and it was not allowed to come to vote before the end of the time allotted for its discussion in 1878 there was a division upon introduction which threw it out by 220 to 140 after a systematic canvass by a committee of those opposed to the measure and in 1879 a res olution in favor was proposed but rejected by a vote of 217 to 10322 By the close of the session however no less than 1273 petitions with

cabinet On the first of May the bill having passed second reading went into the com mittee of the whole At this point Mr Woodall gave notice to add an amendment to the effect that the words in the represen tation of the people act importing the masculine gender include women This was the signal for the steam roller In a letter to Mr Woodall the prime minister wrote an eloquent expose of its

Courtney its sponsor an opportunity to press a second reading A motion to adjourn was immediately made but defeated 142 to 137 Then a motion to adjourn the bill was thrown out 149 to 102and it passed the second reading without a division30 For the second time the house had gone on record when not under pressure from the cabinet as in favor of suffrage But the steam roller was still at work The government gave no furtheropportunity for the bill to come to third reading before a general election in the sum mer brought parliament to a close31 It is claimed that from that day to this a majority

opposition with a logic all too strained insisted that Mr Smith take all Wednes days or none May 13 was on a Wednesday and again the bill was crowded outby clear design35 In 1892 in spite of efforts of the opposition to the bill to prolong the Easter recess beyond the day set for its consideration it came to a debate and division The weight of Mr Gladstones potential power36 and an opposition

the cabinet to foster the measure To that end Mr Keir Hardie sought to test the suffrage sentiment by a resolution He se cured second place on April 25 1906 The supporters of the preceding resolution

of suffragettes and declared personally in favor of the movement but said he could not commit the government because some members of the cabinet were opposed50 In spite of this setback however Mr Keir

the first time in the history of the movement a member Mr Dickinson secured the coveted first place out of 670 on the ballot who was willing to use it for a suffrage bill and the measure thus gained more of a chance than any other private members bill to become law The prime minister it is asserted had even promised to support it in the house but when it came on for debate March 8 he said that while he was in favor of the general principle of the inclusion of women that this particular bill had not met his view of the case He did say however that this was one of the not infrequent oc casions when it is the duty of the government    to leave the decision of the question before it to the house54 a most enlightening remark in the face of parliamentary su premacy But the opposition ably supported by the speaker of the house who no less than three times denied a motion to put the question then proceeded to talk the bill out in a five hours debate The house adjourned without a vote The govern ment later refused to give another day for the discussion of the bill and Mr Dickinson withdrew it to make way for a suffrage resolution by Sir Charles McLaren Taking advantage of a rule of the house by which a resolution cannot be proceeded with if a bill dealing with the same subject has been introduced a wellknown antisuffragist Mr Levy now brought forward a bill which he

motion for closing the debate and the house divided For the fourth time the bill for suffrage was approved on a vote of record in the housethis time by the overwhelming vote of 271 to 92 Mr Herbert Gladstone in supporting the bill personally had thrown a sidelight on the workings of the house by stating that argument alone is not enough to win the political day57 He might also have added Nor is it enough to win a large majority of the party in powerthe party that represents the public will and the desires of the house in legislation and administration Out of 374 Liberal members who composed the government majority at the time no less than 218 voted in favor of the bill31 more than a clear majority of the party in the house The vote stood AyesLiberals 218 Conservatives 32 Nationalists 21

possible for it to ignore the wishes of so large a majority of its own members But the cabinet did so ignore them Mr Gladstone had stated as spokesman for the government that they would leave the house free to decide the question for itself Subsequent developments however were an ironical commen tary on this promise of the government As the speaker had recognized the closure resolution only on condition that the bill be referred to the committee of the whole instead of to a standing committee its fate lay in the hands of the government But the house having decided the wrong way for itself when it made little difference was not allowed to do so againwhen it would be really effective The bill never even came before the committee Before the session was over CampbellBannerman resigned

in the hope that another vote would bring pressure on the government to include a suffrage clause in the forthcoming franchise reform bill which had been promised by the prime minister Mr How ard introduced a new bill along universal suffrage lines It was thoroughly debated on March 19 and came to a vote The prime minister speaking officially against it declared that any measure of this kind ought in my opinion    to proceed from the responsible government of the day But in spite of this steam roller operation the measure passed with a vote of 157 to 122 Again it was rejected by the automatic device of no further time allowed60 PARLIAMENT OF JANUARY 1910 In 1910 a conciliation committee of suffrage members of parliament was formed to draft a bill that would be agreeable to all factions and both parties and the militants who had be gun their campaign of direct action called a truce pending the fate of the measure A bill was drawn along the lines of the municipal household franchise with no disqualification for mar riage and for the first time in history the government officially set aside two days for debate They did not however make it a government measure The debate was thorough no less than thirtynine speeches were made pro and con during the allotted two days When a division was finally reached the house again for the sixth time recorded itself in favor of suffrage and this time by a majority of 109more than the government could command for their chief measures The vote stood 299 to 29061 Then came a division on the question of reference to a standing

particular suffrage bill and had urged that at least it be committed to the whole house The antisuffragists in the hope of shelving the bill and those who genuinely believed that so important a measure should be con sidered by the whole house in each of its stages combined to carry this motion by 320 to 17562 Again the government re fused to give further time for consideration of the bill and again the overwhelming sentiment of the house was directly and open ly flouted by the cabinet But stranger even than this was the vote of the house on November 18 following which in effect added its stamp of approval to this highhanded proceeding against itself The prime minister had moved that the remain ing days of the session be given over exclusively to government business Viscount Castlereagh then proposed an amendment excepting time for further discussion of the suffrage bill Be cause it would mean a vote of censure on the government however the pressure on the members was so great that they re fused to give time to themselves to carry out their own wishes by a vote of 199 to 5263 The parliament closed with a promise by Mr Asquith of facilities in the next house if he were returned for a suffrage bill framed to admit of free amendment PARLIAMENT OF DECEMBER 1910 The conciliation committee was again formed when the next parliament opened in 1911 with Mr Asquith again in power Its members drew first second and third places in the ballot which again gave the bill the best chance of any private members measure to pass It came on for second reading framed to ad mit of free amendment on May 5 For the seventh time it passed and registered the most sweeping victory yet won The vote stood 255 to 88 There were also 55 pairs64 but those wishing to pair in favor were so many that the demand could 62 E S Pankhurst op cit p 499 63 20 Parl Deb op cit 82148 E S Pankhurst op cit pp 502503 64Members who cannot be present at a vote cancel their votes off with other members

was 316 to 143 opposed But for the seventh time the unmistakable desires of a large section of the house were ignored and no further time was granted for the bills consideration65 Mr Asquith how ever did announce on the floor of the house that his promise of the preceding year would be fulfilled during the session of 1912 This was followed by a statement on November 7 that the government would introduce a franchise reform bill in 1912 based on citizenship but made no mention of women except to promise facilities for the conciliation bill Some ten days later he admitted that he was in the minority in the cabinet in his opposition to womens suffrage and said that although he could not initiate a bill to that end he was prepared to bow to the judgment of the house6 Had Mr Asquith been a prophet he could not have foretold more accurately how this sparring for time would work into his own hands and that of the minority It is a general rule of polit ical development that when a large section of a community can not secure from the government by peaceful and constitutional means what they believe to be their rights they will inevitably resort to the only method leftrevolution The United States as an independent nation to take the most obvious example is dedicated to the truth of this proposition Practically every extension of manhood suffrage in England and the Continent has piled up its proof The women of England were no ex ception Outbreaks of violence begun again by the militants after the failure of the bill of the previous year culminated dur ing the early days of March in outrages of every conceivable kind committed in all parts of the country67 It was under these auspices that the suffrage bill of 1912 came to its second reading in the house on March 28 Time and the law of revolution had come to play partners with Mr Asquith 65 25 Parl Deb op cit 738810 E S Pankhurst op cit p 504 Fawcett op cit pp 7778 66 Fawcett op cit pp 7880 67 Militant tactics used from the formation of the W S P U 1903 to 1910 caused no setback in the progress of suff rage bills in the house their effect was probably the other way304 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW There was an extended debate The supporters of the bill were obliged to take from the outset an apologetic attitude for the militants and Mr Asquith claiming to speak only as an indi vidual strongly opposed not only the theory of suffrage but the particular bill before the house The result was all that he might have foretold The division came at eleven oclock after seven hours debate and the vote showed him victor The second reading was by the bare majority of 14 222 to 208 put off to this day six monthsie off the calendar of the house altogether68 At the next session of parliament 1913 the government introduced its longexpected franchise and registration bill It did not of course carry any provision for womens suffrage but Mr Asquith true to his former pledge that adequate amend ment facilities would be given in that direction had three days of the committee stage set aside for that purpose Three such amend ments were introduced involving three different franchises69 When the day January 27 opened for their consideration the prime minister arose and asked the speaker whether any or all of them would change the character of the bill To this the chair replied that all would so change its character as to consti tute a new bill The government was then in this dilemma they might either press the bill as it was or introduce a new one with a suffrage provision But they could not do the latter because Mr Asquith would not consent to father a suffrage measure and on the other hand if they pressed the bill they would violate their pledges to the suffragists There was but one way out and not a bad one from the prime ministers point of view Mr Asquith claiming that he had had no intimation that the speaker would rule as he did moved on behalf of the gov ernment that the whole bill be withdrawn The machine rolled after him 283 to 112 and suffrage was again and for the last time until the present thrown out of court70 The great war then intervened in behalf of the prime

in the case is now in A review of the record will disclose first that individual members of the house of com mons even though they include a large majority of the party in power as well as a voting majority on the opposition benches cannot make over their convictions into the law of the land in the face of cabinet opposition There is some evidence to indicate that a majority of the entire membership of the house is equally powerless The record also shows the convictions of a majority of voting members were blocked from effective expression no less than seven times It further reveals twenty instances where what may have been a majority of the mem bers were not allowed to register their convictions even on a second reading The data discloses finally the various uses to which the legis lative machine can be directed in opposition to house senti ment by its cabinetengineers There is first the direct cabinet pressure on the members of the house Any legislative body of more than a handful of members requires some kind of machine to make it effective If the 670 members of the house gathered together without rules without leaders and without party groups little or no legislation would be forthcoming The session would be a bedlam of enthusiasm desires and debates unorganized utterly at odds and entirely ineffectual Furthermore during the past century the business of legislating which the house must perform has increased by leaps and bounds If its mere size required a highly organized machine in 1815 this enormous increase in business has made it tenfold more essential in 1915 The result of this pressure of circumstances aided and abetted by the leaders human craving for power has been the creation of a party organization within the house that is perhaps the most rigid in the world The young man who enters parliament today finds soon enough that the first essential to success is absolute obedience to the leaders of his party Independence is insanity in the house of commons It would be the suicide of effectiveness Power comes only through prominence in the counsels of the306 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW party in power prominence only through subserviency to those who can bestow it 71 The result is inevitable The private member has become to a large degree the cabinets rubber stamp on every government measureor the rubber stamp of those who hope to succeed to that high estate No better proof of this can be had than the votes on the suffrage bill of 1870 and the suffrage amendment to the reform bill of 1884 In each case scores of private mem bers who on the second reading or in their pledges to their constituents occasions when they were permitted to retain their individuality approved these measures were later used by the cabinet as rubber stamps officially to negative their own expressed convictions The same thing happened in 1871 1872 1873 on the second bill of 1906 and in 1892 in a slightly varied formforced subserviency to an opposition leader who may become chief patronage dispenser and font of power at the next general election The second foundation stone of cabinet autocracy is the control of the government over the time of the house The pres sure of business is now so great that the members of the house in their capacity of rubber stamps have sanctioned rules giving government bills right of way to an extent which in their capacity as individuals they bitterly and openly resent These rules have given power to the cabinet to plot out the course of legis lative business at all sessions except a very few reserved for private members measures Their time is limited to Tuesdays and Wednesdays from 815 to 11 pm and on Fridays from noon to 530 After Easter however the Tuesday period is eliminated and after Whitsuntide only the third and fourth Fridays following are allowed to the private member72 Even these days are not secure against government aggression The private members have less than ten per cent of all the time of the house at their disposaland the individual member must 71 For two brilliant analyses of this situation see Belloc and Chesterton The Party System pp 7798

that small fraction may be eaten into by government business The way this works out in practice and a suggestion of how it can be used as a club on offending legislation by the cabinet may be seen from the fate of the suffrage measures of 1874 1881 1884 second bill 1885 1887 1895 1896 1899 1900 1901 and 1903 Another use of the control of time is the cabinets power over the sittings of the committee of the whole If a private members bill passes its second reading and is referred to the house sitting as this committee73 it is absolutely at the cabinets mercy for the government controls all these periods The deadly effect of this big stick on the private member is illustrated by the suf frage measures of 1886 1889 1907 1908 1909 1910 and 1911 A third method of cabinet domination is the power of any member either in his individual or his rubber stamp capacity to talk a bill out The private members time as we have seen is fixed and rigid If the debate can be prolonged until the closing hour any bill can be as effectively defeated as by a clear adverse vote This method we have seen freely used against suffrage in 1882 1890 1893 1897 1898 1905 1906 and 1907 If all these methods fail there is still the chance that the speaker will hand down a ruling that will favor the cabinetas occurred in 1913 The speaker of the house of commons is by tradition a purely nonpartisan official and his rulings are in theory strictly judicial74 It has not been proved that in 1913 or in 1907 when he refused to recognize motions for closure which would have prevented the bill from being talked out he was deliberately opposing suffrage measures But at least there is the possibil ity of a speaker in league with the cabinet influencing bills in this waya temptation of some force on occasions It is practically impossible as this page of parliamentary his tory bears eloquent testimony for a private members bill to dodge the fatal blows of the cabinet big stick if they see fit to use it Of course such private measures do pass Some ten 73 This is done on all contentious billsie measures of some importance which are opposed 14 Lowell op cit p 260308 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW or fifteen usually find their way into the statute books each year Only one or two of them a session however are likely to stir enough opposition to lead to a division75 That of course is the secret of their success the big stick has not been wielded It must be clear by this time that as far as the wishes of the individual members goor even of a majority of the majority partythere is no such thing as parliamentary supremacy The cabinet controls all legislation proposed by the commons It may still be true however that the commons may exercise some control over legislation proposed by the cabinetthat its members may be free to oppose the dictates of the governing clique Certainly constitutional theory would have it so the cabinet must resign should the house register an adverse vote on any important government bill That is the theory Again the practice explodes it A most cursory examination of the causes of cabinet changes during the last half century will be sufficient at least to arouse our suspicions Since the year 1870 of all the government measures introduced into the house by the cabinet of the day only one has been clearly defeated in such a way as to cause the resignation of the ministrythe home rule bill of 1886 which caused the overthrow of Gladstone It may be true that the cabinet would resign if defeated on a measure in the house a threat often used against recalcitrant membersbut every cabinet official must know that the chances of such a defeat are practically nil The party machine is a twoedged sword It cuts both ways It beheads the private member if he pushes his own bill and it beheads him if he opposes the bill of his leaders It is only in the rarest crises that the sword does not win the day for the cabinet that wields it In other words whatever doubt may remain that the cabinet can effectually thwart even a majority of the members of the house there can be even less doubt of the converse of the prop osition If any cabinet in the past thirty years had made suf 7 Lowell op cit p 314WOMAN SUFFRAGE IN PARLIAMENT 309 frage a government measure only the rather doubtful power of the lords could have prevented its becoming the law and prac tice of the land It seems as though the story of parliamentary supremacy like that of the subconscious mind in Mifnsterbergs book could be told in three words there is none At all events the history of suffrage in parliament can furnish one chapter in the case against its existence The full story and the final proof of the domination of the cabinet have yet to be written We have applied in detail but one acid test to the prevailing theory The reaction we obtained is but a small part of what might be written and it is entirely negative But the experiment has yielded at least one positive byproduct a lesson to all those who beat the frail fists of their agitation against the cold smooth walls of the English parliament It is this convert the cabinet first oroverthrow

BY DR EMANUEL H VOGEL PROFESSOR IN THE UNIVERSITY OF VIENNA THE FATE OF AUSTRIAN CURRENCY BEST SHOWS THE SERIOUS CONSE QUENCES OF THE PEACE TREATY AND THE DISMEMBERMENT OF THE OLD MONARCHY WHICH FORMED A HOMOGENEOUS SIMPLE TERRITORY AS FAR AS CUSTOMS AND CUR RENCY WERE CONCERNED AT THE BEGIN NING OF THE WAR THE CURRENCY OF THE OLD STATE WAS ON THE WHOLE CONSOLIDATED BY AN APPROPRIATE EXCHANGE POLICY THE AUSTROHUNGARIAN BANK SUCCEEDED IN MAINTAINING THE GOLD PARITY OF ITS NOTES ON JULY 23 1914 THE BANK BOASTED A METAL RESERVE OF 1589 MIL LION KRONEN AND A BANK NOTE CIRCULATION OF 2130 MILLIONS IE 75 PER CENT WAS COVERED IN GOLD DURING THE WAR THIS RELATION SANK AS INFLATION INCREASED AT THE TIME OF THE BREAKDOWN OF AUSTRIAHUNGARY NOVEMBER 1918 THE CIRCULATION OF BANK NOTES AMOUNTED TO 356 BILLION KRONEN THE OUTSTANDING DEBTS GIROGUTHABEN TO 71 BILLION THAT IS THE CURRENT LIABILITIES AMOUNTED ALTOGETHER TO 427 BILLION KRONEN COV ERED BY THE METAL RESERVE ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF EIGHTTENTHS OF ONE PER CENT SIMULTANEOUSLY THE VALUE OF THE AUS TRIAN KRONE IN THE FOREIGN MARKETS RAPIDLY DEPRECIATED NEW YORK BILLS IN VIENNA WHICH AT THE END OF AUGUST 1914 NOTED 512 KRONEN ROSE AT THE END OF 1915 TO 785 KRONEN THE PRICE OF THE DOLLAR IN VIENNA AT THE END OF 1916 TO 956 AFTER THE BREAKDOWN AT THE END OF NOVEMBER 1918 TO 1582 AT THE END OF JUNE 1919 TO 3025 IN OCTOBER 1919 TO 103 IN DECEMBER 1919 TO 155 IN FEBRUARY 1920 TO 250 IN JUNE 1920 TO 148 IN OCTOBER 1IRVING FISHER THE PURCHASING POWER OF MONEY NEW YORK 1911 1920 TO 405 IN DECEMBER 1920 TO 659 IN APRIL 1921 TO 666 AND ON JULY 23 1921 TO 846 KRONEN THE DREADFUL DEPRECIATION OF THE CUR RENCY ILLUSTRATED BY THESE FIGURES SET IN WITH THE BREAKDOWN OF THE MONE TARY UNITY AND WITH THE PROCESS OF A TOTAL SEPARATION OF THE SINGLE SUCCES SION STATES FROM THE FORMERLY UNIFORM CURRENCY SYSTEM OF THE MONARCHY THIS PROCESS OF SEPARATION WAS ALSO AC COMPANIED BY SAD CONSEQUENCES FOR THE BANK NOTES OF THE OTHER SUCCESSION STATES THOUGH THESE WERE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE AUSTRIAN NOTES BY BEING IM PRESSED WITH A STAMP TO SHOW THE COUN TRY TO WHICH THEY BELONGED THE RATE OF EXCHANGE OF THESE NOTES SANK LIKE WISE BELOW THE LEVEL OF THAT OF THE UNI FORM NOTES OF FORMER AUSTRIA IN THE FOREIGN MARKETS THE DEPRECIATION WITHIN THE FIVE SMALL NEW CURRENCY UNITS DIFFERED ONLY IN EXTENT FROM THAT OF AUSTRIA AND WAS OF COURSE MODIFIED ACCORDING TO THE DEGREE OF THE ECO NOMIC CONSOLIDATION AND EQUIPMENT OC CASIONED BY THE TERMS OF THE PEACE TREATY THE FIRST TO BEGIN WITH THE CURRENCY SEPARATION WAS JUGOSLAVIA WHICH ON JANUARY 8 1919 ORDERED THE AUSTROHUNGARIAN NOTES ON JUGOSLAV TERRITORY TO BE STAMPED WITH A NATIONAL MARK CZECHOSLOVAKIA FOLLOWED SUIT BY THE LAW OF FEBRUARY 25 1919 THEN CAME POLAND AND AT LAST HUNGARY IN 1920 ALL THE SUCCESSION STATES CARRIED OUT THESE MEASURES WITHOUT FIRST TRYING TO ARRIVE AT AN AGREEMENT EITHER WITH THE AUSTROHUNGARIAN BANK OR WITH THE BANKS OF NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES THOUGH AN UNDERSTANDING WITH REGARD TO ANTHE CURRENCY PROBLEM OF AUSTRIA ORGANIZED SEPARATION OF THE CURRENCIES WOULD HAVE BEEN BEST FOR ALL CONCERNED WITH THE CREATION OF INDEPENDENT NA TIONAL CURRENCIES THEIR INDEPENDENT QUOTATIONS WERE STARTED IN THE FOREIGN MARKETS FIRST ON AN APPROXIMATELY EVEN BASIS AND LATER IN 1919 AND 1920 WITH AN ALWAYS GREATER DIFFERENTIATION TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE REMAINING AND ALSO NATIONALLY STAMPED AUSTRIAN CURRENCY THE FIGURES IN TABLE 1 SHOW THE ENOR MOUS CHANGE IN THE VALUE OF THE AUS TRIAN KRONE HERE THE RATE OF EXCHANGE LOWED THE EXPORT STILL PROHIBITED UP TILL NOW THE AUSLANDSKRONEN HAVE BEEN QUOTED HIGHER THAN THE INLANDS KRONEN SINCE THE FORMER COULD BE USED FOR PAYMENT NOT ONLY IN AUSTRIA BUT ALSO ABROAD AND AS THEIR AVAILABLE NUMBER IS LIMITED WHILE THE LATTER MAY AS A RULE BE USED FOR PAYMENT OR IN VESTMENTS IN AUSTRIA ONLY TABLE 2 SHOWS THE MOVEMENT OF THE RATE OF EXCHANGE OF THE CHEQUES ON VIENNA IN ZURICH AUSZAHLUNG WIEN GELD

WITH THE PURPOSE OF STOPPING THE OVERSTOCKING OF FOREIGN MARKETS WITHOUT HOWEVER BEING ABLE TO PREVENT SMUGGLING A DIFFERENCE WAS PRODUCED BETWEEN THE RATE OF EXCHANGE OF INLAND KRONEN INLANDSKRONEN AND FOREIGN KRONEN AUSLANDSKRONEN AT PRESENT THE IMPORT OF KRONEN IS AL THE AUSLANDSKRONE WHILE THE RATE OF EXCHANGE OF THE OSTERREICHISCH GESTEM PELTE KRONENNOTEN BANK NOTES STAMPED BY THE REPUBLIC

CHEQUES ON VIENNA DROP TO THE LEVEL OF THE KRONEN BANK NOTES THIS SURVEY SHOWS WELL ENOUGH THAT THE REAL CATASTROPHE OF THE RATE OF EX CHANGE ONLY TOOK PLACE AFTER THE WAR IN THE YEARS 1919 AND 1920

1919 IT MAINTAINED A RATE OF 185 CEN TIMES A LEVEL WHICH NOT EVEN THE BOLD EST FINANCIAL PLAN ON THE PART OF AUS TRIA OR OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS WOULD DREAM OF REACHING AGAIN THIS PROVES THAT BY A TIMELY INTERFERENCE THE DE ROUTE OF THE AUSTRIAN EXCHANGE MIGHT HAVE BEEN INHIBITED OR AVOIDED EN TIRELY AT MUCH SMALLER SACRIFICES THAN ARE NOW DEMANDED IT PROVES FURTHER THAT THIS DEPRECIATION WAS BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE ONESIDED MEASURES OF THE SUCCESSION STATES WHICH WERE CARRIED THROUGH WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST REGARD FOR THE AUSTROHUNGARIAN BANK OR FOR THE EXCHANGE OF THE NOTES LEFT TO AUSTRIA ANOTHER REASON WAS THE ENORMOUS INFLA TION OF BANK NOTES IN AUSTRIA HERSELF WHICH BECAME INEVITABLE BECAUSE OF THE FINANCIAL WANTS OF AUSTRIA THE TERRIBLE SHORTAGE OF COMMODITIES THE RISE OF ALL PRICES CHIEFLY OF THOSE FOR IMPORTS NATURALLY CAUSED BY THE DEPRECIATION ITSELF AND SO ON IN ENDLESS SUCCESSION STILL THE AUSTRIAN KRONE RETAINS A HIGHER PURCHASING POWER AT HOME THAN ABROAD BUT THIS ONE ISOLATED FACT WHICH IS FAVORABLE FOR THE CONSUMER NOW BE GINS TO VANISH AS THE RISE DUE TO WILD SPECULATION WITH WARES AND FOREIGN VALUES HAS BROUGHT THE PRICES OF COM MODITIES AND WAGES ALMOST ON A PAR WITH THOSE IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES IN SOME CASES THEY HAVE EVEN SURPASSED THEM WHAT THIS MEANS WHILE THE AUSTRIAN KRONE IS ALMOST COMPLETELY DEPRECIATED ON JULY 21 1921 077 CENTIMES AT ZURICH CAN WELL BE IM AGINED SO IT CAME TO PASS THAT OF LATE 30THE CURRENCY PROBLEM OF AUSTRIA EVEN THE HUNGARIAN KRONE WHICH HAD ALWAYS BEEN VALUED LOWER GAINED CON SIDERABLY OVER THE AUSTRIAN KRONE ON JULY 21 1921 185 CENTIMES SO THAT THE EXCHANGE OF GOODS WITH THIS NEIGH BORING COUNTRY WAS RENDERED MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE FOR AUSTRIA THE FINANCIAL SCHEME OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS WHICH WAS ABANDONED AL MOST AS SOON AS IT HAD BEEN STARTED COULD EFFECT ONLY A QUITE TRANSIENT IM PROVEMENT OF THE RATE OF EXCHANGE ON THE CHEQUES ON VIENNA AT ZURICH TO 170 CENTIMES APRIL 16 1921 BESIDE THE CONTINUOUS DELAY OF THE PROMISED INTERNATIONAL CREDITS THE AUSTRIAN RATE OF EXCHANGE WAS PREJU DICED BY THE NEWS THAT THE PROGRAM OF THE DELEGATES OF THE LEAGUE OF NA TIONS PROVIDES FOR A STABILIZATION OF THE RATE OF EXCHANGE ONLY ON THE BASES OF ONE TO TWO THAT IS HARDLY ABOVE THE PRESENT LEVEL BUT NOT EVEN FOR THIS PLAN COULD THE MOST NECESSARY CONDI TION THE SUPPRESSION OF THE GENERAL MORTGAGE LAID ON ALL THE REVENUES OF AUSTRIA BY THE PEACE TERMS BE OB TAINED THE PRESUMABLE FAILURE OF SUCH A SCHEME EVEN IF IT COULD BE CAR RIED OUT WITH FEWER SACRIFICES WAS VAL UED ACCORDINGLY IN THE MONEY MARKET BESIDE THE REPEAL OF THE KRONEN IMPORT EMBARGO AND ITS CONSEQUENCE THE EQUALIZING OF THE AUSLANDS AND INLANDS KRONE DEPRECIATED THE RATE OF EXCHANGE OF THE AUSLANDSKRONE AS THE REASON FOR ITS BEING VALUED HIGHER WAS PARTLY RE MOVED SOON AFTER THE RATE OF EX CHANGE OF KRONEN BANK NOTES AND CHEQUES DROPPED RAPIDLY TO REACH ITS LOWEST LEVEL ON JULY 21 1921 THE SOLE CONSOLATION FOR THIS FINANCIAL RUIN OF A COUNTRY MAY PERHAPS BE FOUND IN THE FACT THAT ON THE SAME DAY THE POLISH MARK THOUGH FROM OTHER CAUSES WAS RATED AT ZURICH AT ONLY 032 CEN TIMES AND WAS SOMEWHAT NEARER THE LOW WATER MARK THE SITUATION OF THE AUSTROHUN GARIAN BANK AS FAR AS IT HAS THE FUNC TION OF ISSUING NOTES FOR THE REPUBLIC OF AUSTRIA HAS NATURALLY BECOME WORSE THE CIRCULATION OF STAMPED AUSTRIAN BANK NOTES ALREADY AMOUNTED TO 5014 BILLION KRONEN ON JULY 7 1921 THE OTHER LIABILITIES DUE IMMEDIATELY TO 91 BILLIONS THESE WERE COVERED BY A MENTAL RESERVE INCLUDING GOLD BONDS ONLY UP TO 5220132 KRONEN THE PRINCIPAL ASSETS ARE THE TREASURY BONDS ISSUED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND PRE SENTED AT THE AUSTROHUNGARIAN BANK TO THE AMOUNT OF 478 BILLION KRONEN WHEN IN JANUARY 1920 THE AUSTRIAN BANK NOTES INFLATION WAS DISCLOSED FOR THE FIRST TIME APART FROM THAT OF HUN GARY AND THAT OF THE NONSTAMPED AND NATIONALIZED NOTES OF THE FORMER MONARCHY THE AUSTRIAN CIRCULATION AMOUNTED TO ONLY 132 BILLION KRONEN WHEREAS THE GOLD RESERVE AMOUNTED TO 2226 MILLION BESIDE 114 MILLIONS GOLD BILLS AND 57 MILLION SILVER CURRENCY THE TOTAL BANK NOTES CIRCULATION OF THE FORMER MONARCHY AMOUNTED TO 356 MILLIONS KRONEN AT THE END OF 1918 IE PREVIOUS TO THE REAL FINANCIAL EXPLANA TION TABLE 3 SHOWS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BANK NOTE CIRCULATION IN MILLIONS KRONEN ON TOP OF ALL THIS THERE CAME THE LIQUIDATION WHICH IS FORCED UPON THE BANK BY ARTICLE 206 OF THE TREATY OF ST GERMAIN THIS WAS ONLY ACTUALLY BE GUN IN THE YEAR 1920 ACCORDING TO THE WORDING OF THE TREATY THE FORMER MANAGERS OF THE BANK AS THE LEGITIMATE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SHAREHOLDERS AND THE AUSTRIAN AND HUNGARIAN GOVERN MENT ARE TOTALLY EXCLUDED FROM THE LIQUIDATION AND ONLY THE LIQUIDATORS NOMINATED BY THE REPARATIONS COM MISSION ARE CHARGED

GOLD RESERVE BY ORDER OF THE REPARATIONS COMMISSION THE BANK HANDED OVER TO BEGIN WITH AN AMOUNT OF 65 MILLION GOLD KRONEN TO THE LIQUIDATORS OUT OF WHICH ADVANCES WERE GIVEN TO THE SUC CESSION STATES AUSTRIA RECEIVED AFTER A CREDIT ALREADY PAID BACK TO HOLLAND HAD BEEN DEDUCTED ABOUT 8 MILLION GOLD KRONEN CONCERNING OTHER PROBLEMS TOO THE ENFORCEMENT OF ARTICLE 206 OF THE TREATY OF ST GERMAIN CAUSED THE GREATEST DIFFICULTIES IT IS NOW GENER ALLY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE STRICT AP PLICATION OF THESE DECISIONS OF THE PEACE TREATY CANNOT BE CARRIED THROUGH THE LIQUIDATORS ARE NOW BRING ING ABOUT AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE SUCCESSION STATES CONCERNED REGARDING THE PROBLEM OF RECOVERY OF THE BANK NOTES THE LIABILITIES TO THE CREDITORS OF THE NOTES ETC BUT THIS ATTEMPT AT SOME AGREEMENT ENCOUNTERS GREAT DIFFI CULTIES IN THE SUCCESSION STATES SO THAT ALL THESE COMPLICATED LEGAL AND FINANCIAL QUESTIONS ARE WAITING FOR SETTLEMENT MUCH TO THE DAMAGE OF THE AUSTRIAN CURRENCY WHOSE RATE OF EXCHANGE HAS TO SUFFER BY THE UNCERTAINTY CONCERNING FINANCES AND CURRENCY A SETTLEMENT WILL GO FAR TOWARD STABILIZATION 32THE CURRENCY PROBLEM OF AUSTRIA SUMMARY THE WHOLE SITUATION OF AUSTRIAN FINANCE IS NOT PROMISING FOR AS WE HAVE SEEN IT IS AN IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCE OF AN UNEQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF BURDENS AT THE CREATION OF THE NEW NATIONAL STATES OUT OF THE RUINS OF THE OLD MONARCHY UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE BANK NOTE INFLATION APPEARS AS A NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE OF THE GENERAL FINANCIAL SITUATION AS A MATTER OF COURSE IT CON TINUES TO DEPRESS THE VALUE OF THE CUR RENCY AND FORCES UP THE PRICE OF ALL COMMODITIES IT IS CHARACTERISTIC ENOUGH THAT NEITHER THE ANNOUNCE MENT OF AN ACTION OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS AND THE FINANCIAL PROGRAM ELABORATED FOR THIS PURPOSE NOR THE PROMISED CREDIT OF FOREIGN VALUES COULD BRING ABOUT THE EXPECTED IM PROVEMENT ON THE KRONEN EXCHANGE IN THE FOREIGN MARKETS ON THE CONTRARY SHORTLY AFTER THE AUSTRIAN KRONE SUF FERED A SLUMP DOWN TO 087 CENTIMES ON CHEQUES ZURICHVIENNA AND CLOSED WITH 090 CENTIMES FOR CHEQUES AND 079 CENTIMES FOR STAMPED AUS TRIAN BANK NOTES ON JULY 3 1921 WE MAY INFER FROM ALL THESE FACTS THAT PRELIMINARY TO THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW CURRENCY A RISE OF THE AUSTRIAN KRONEN VALUE MUST BE THE AIM BY THE ACCUMULATION OF AMPLE GOLD FUNDS AND SUITABLE MEASURES BASED ON EXTENSIVE INSTALMENTS OF CREDITS FROM THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS IN ALL THE PRINCIPAL MONEY MARKETS THE KRONE MIGHT BE RAISED TO EQUAL 8 SWISS FRANCS ON THE AVERAGE THUS ENABLING AUSTRIA TO TRADE FREELY WITH THE SURROUNDING NATIONAL STATES AT THE VERY LOWEST A RATE OF EXCHANGE OF ABOUT 4 TO 5 OUGHT TO BE ATTAINED IF A MOVE TOWARD RECONSTRUCTION IS TO BE MADE WITH ANY PROSPECT OF SUCCESS SUBSEQUENT ONLY TO HAVING REACHED SUCH A DESIRABLE BASIS BY EASY STAGES AND WITHIN A SUITABLE PERIOD OF TIME SO AS TO AVOID ANY ABRUPT CHANGES ENDAN GERING THE EXPORT MANUFACTURES WITH THE EFFECTS OF A PRESUMABLE SLUMP THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW CURRENCY AND THE STABILIZATION OF THE NEW RATE OF EX CHANGE MIGHT BE ATTEMPTED THIS WILL NECESSITATE A CONTINUATION OF FOREIGN SUPPORT IN FUTURE THE PROPOSED RES PITE OF ONLY TWENTY YEARS BEFORE THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE RIGHT OF A GENERAL MORTGAGE ON THE AUSTRIAN REVENUE WILL PROVE TOO SHORT UNDER THESE CIRCUM STANCES AS THERE MUST BE A POSSIBILITY OF PROLONGING OPEN FOREIGN CREDITS BE YOND THIS PERIOD AN ATTEMPT AT STABILIZATION ON THE EXISTING BASIS OF 1 OR 2 WOULD ALLOW ONLY A HAND TO MOUTH EXISTENCE IN THE PRES ENT FASHION BUT NOT A DEFINITE REFORM IN THE LONG RUN THE MAJORITY OF THE PEO PLE WILL BE UNABLE TO BEAR ALL THE RE STRICTIONS OF A MENTAL INTELLECTUAL AND PHYSICAL NATURE IN THIS RESPECT IT MAY BE IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT PARTICULARLY THAT THE OUTWARD SHOW OF LUXURIES IN VIENNA BY ITS NUMEROUS FOREIGN VISITORS DOES NOT ALLOW ANY INFERENCE TO BE DRAWN AS TO THE REAL STANDARD OF LIFE OF THE LABORING CLASSES IF TODAY LOVE OF PLEASURE AND LUXURY ARE TO BE SEEN IF THE RESTAURANTS CAFES AND PLEASURE RE SORTS ARE CROWDED IT MUST BE REGARDED AS ONE OF THE SAD SYMPTOMS ATTENDANT ON ANY GREAT CRISIS IN ANY COUNTRY THE LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE CONSTANCY OF THE VALUE OF THE CURRENCY LEADS TO RECKLESS SPENDING AS NOBODY LIKES TO RISK A LASTING INVESTMENT OF CAPITAL OR TO SAVE UP MONEY FOR THE FUTURE BUT IT WOULD BE A GREAT MISTAKE TO BELIEVE THE TRUE BORN VIENNESE ROLLS IN LUXURY IN REALITY IT IS ONLY THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE ENRICHED THEMSELVES DURING AND AFTER THE WAR AND WHO ARE NOW FILLING THE RANKS OF THE WARPROFITEERS AND SPECULATORS BY MAKING EXTRAORDINARY GAINS IN AN UNSCRUPULOUS MANNER RUN NING UP THE PRICES OF ALL NECESSITIES OF LIFE DEALING IN FOREIGN VALUES AND CON TRIBUTING TO THE DEPRECIATION OF THE 33THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY AUSTRIAN KRONE TO A GREAT EXTENT THIS SET OF PEOPLE IS INTERMINGLED WITH FOR EIGNERS CHIEFLY FORMER WARREFUGEES FROM EASTERN GALICIA AND BUCOVINA WHO AFTER HAVING SETTLED DOWN IN VIENNA PERMANENTLY MAKE THE BEST OF THE PREVAILING CONDITIONS BY ACCUMU LATING RICHES IN THIS RESPECT THE LOW RATE OF EX CHANGE HAS HAD THE MOST SERIOUS CON SEQUENCES FOR AUSTRIA IT FIRST LED TO SELLING OFF AUSTRIAN NECESSITIES WHICH WANDERED ABROAD FREQUENTLY ONLY TO BE REIMPORTED AFTER A TIME AND SOLD AT A HIGH PRICE WHEN THE SHORTAGE OF COM MODITIES BECAME INTOLERABLE THIS FAV ORABLE OPPORTUNITY OVER AN UNRE STRAINED SPECULATION IN FOREIGN VALUES AND EXCHANGES SET IN TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE RATE OF EXCHANGE AND PURCHASING CAPACITY OF THE KRONE AT HOME AND ABROAD IN AUSTRIA MANY OF THE PARA SITES DESCRIBED CONTRIBUTE VASTLY TO WARD THE RISE IN PRICES AND THERE IS NO LEGAL MEANS TO STOP THEM OR EVEN TO SUBJECT THEM TO AN EFFECTIVE TAXATION APART FROM THIS MOTLEY CROWD OF SPEC ULATORS FROM HOME AND ABROAD THE SET SECURING THE DOUBTFUL FAME OF VIENNA AS A CENTER OF LUXURIES AND PLEASURES IS FORMED OF FOREIGNERS THEY FLOCK TO GETHER FROM THE NATIONAL STATES AND THE ABNORMALLY HIGH PURCHASING POWER OF THEIR MONEY MAKES VIENNA THE CHEAPEST CITY IN ALL THE WORLD FOR THEM EXACTLY LIKE THE ABOVEMEN TIONED SET OF AUSTRIAN AND FOREIGN SPECULATORS THEY ARE IN A POSITION TO SATISFY A TASTE FOR THE LUXURIES OF LIFE WHICH IS DENIED TO THE REST OF THE POPU LATION THE RESTAURANTS PLACES OF EN TERTAINMENT BIG EMPORIUMS THEATRES AND EVEN THE PLACES WHERE SERIOUS ART IS CULTIVATED RECKON WITH THE NEW RICH AS THEIR CHIEF CUSTOMERS WHEREAS THE ENJOYMENT OF ALL THE REFINEMENTS OF ART AND CIVILIZATION IS DENIED TO THE INTEL LECTUAL MIDDLE CLASSES OF THE NATIVE POPULATION THE ANTAGONISM OF THE CLASSES AND MASSES HAS THUS BEEN INTENSIFIED IN AN ALARMING DEGREE A NEW EXCEEDINGLY LOWBRED SOCIAL LAYER HAS COME TO THE SURFACE THE NEW RICH IT WILL BE A LONG AND ARDUOUS TASK TO HEAL THE SERI OUS ECONOMIC SOCIAL AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST THE INJURIES TO IDEALS IN THE NEW REPUBLIC OF AUSTRIA AND THIS TASK WILL REQUIRE THE STEADY ORGANIZED ASSISTANCE OF THE CIVILIZED COUNTRIES OF THE WEST CHAPTER VII AUSTRIAN BANKS BY DR MAX SOKAL MANAGER OF THE WIENER GIROUND KASSENVEREIN VIENNA IT WAS PROPHESIED OF AUSTRIAN BANKS THAT AFTER THE COLLAPSE OF THE AUSTRO HUNGARIAN MONARCHY THEY WOULD HAVE GREATLY TO REDUCE THEIR ESTABLISHMENTS ON ACCOUNT OF THE DIMINUTION OF THEIR SPHERE OF ACTION THE VASTNESS OF THEIR ORGANIZATIONS BEING WHOLLY OUT OF PRO PORTION TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF CRIPPLED AUSTRIA SO FAR THIS HYPOTHESIS HAS BEEN DIS PROVED BY FACTS THE BANKS VERY SOON HAD TO EXTEND THEIR BUSINESS TO IN CREASE THEIR STAFF TO ENLARGE THEIR PREM ISES AND THE TURNOVER OF THE LAST FINANCIAL YEAR WHERE BALANCE SHEETS ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE SHOWS A CONSIDERABLE SURPLUS OVER THAT OF PRECEDING PERIODS A SURPLUS WHICH IS OF COURSE PARTLY ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE STEADY DEPRECIA TION OF AUSTRIAN CURRENCY 34

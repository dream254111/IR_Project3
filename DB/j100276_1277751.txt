v Metro Life Ins Co 232 I11 37 insured executed for crime The latter case involved the identical policy litigated in the Pennsylvania case supra and the reason ing of the court is striking If a man who is executed for a crime has at his death iooo in real estate Iooo in chattels and Iooo life insurance payable to his estate his real estate descends to his heirs and his personal chattels to his administrator but the Iooo life insurance must be left in the hands of the company who has received the premiums because it is said to be contrary to public policy to require the company to pay lest by so doing it lend encouragement to other policy holders to seek murder and execution therefor in order that their estates or heirs might profit thereby See also execution of insured 6 MICH L REV 489

QUITBy an agreement plaintiff let premises to defendant from November II I915 to December 25 I916 at yearly rent payable in quarterly installments The defendant held over with out any further agreement so that by plaintiffs acceptance of the quarters rent on March 25 I917 defendant was recognized as tenant from year to year On June 8 I917 defendant gave notice that he would quit the premises on December 25 1917 Plaintiff contended that since the original entry was on November II the tenancy could be terminated only on November II of some year and hence the notice on June 8 was ineffective because not six months prior to November II Held that this year to year tenancy was a new tenancy commencing December 25 I916 and determinable on any sub sequent Christmas Day by giving six months notice Croft v Blay I919 88 L J Ch 545 The principal case is an affirmance of the conclusion of Astbury J noted ante p 64 This decision should clear up a matter regarding which there has been confusion since the publication of COLE ON EJECTMENT in 1857 This book contained a statement relied upon by the losing party in the principal case which Warrington L J refers to as the fons et origo mali LIBELFALsE STATEMENT AS TO RECORD OF JUDGMENTINJURY TO CREDIT INNUENDOThe defendants erroneously published in their gazette that a decree in absence had been taken against the plaintiff in a small debts court The plaintiff in action for libel alleges that the publication falsely repre sented that he was given to or had begun to refuse or delay to make payment of his debts and that he was a person to whom credit should not be given Held the publication warranted the innuendo and the defendants were not protected by a headnote to the effect that in no case does publication of the decree imply inability to pay on the part of anyone named or anything more 336RECENT IMPORTANT DECISIONS than the fact that the entry published appeared in the Court Record Stubbs Lim v Mazure 1919 88 L J P C 135 In a former case Stubbs Lim v Russell I913 82 L J P C 98 in which the facts were similar but in which the innuendo alleged was that the plaintiff was unable to pay his debts and was in insolvent circumstances and in pecuniary embarrassment and was evading payment of a just debt it was held the innuendo imported into the publication more than it could reasonably bear that the whole of the statement in the headnote must be read in conjunction with the alleged excerpt from the Sheriff Court books and when it is so read it is impossible that any reasonable man should collect from it the libelous imputation alleged Lord Shaw in this case however pointed out that although the meaning that the plaintiff could not pay because of insolvency was negatived by the headnote nevertheless if he had alleged the meaning of the publication to be that he would not pay because of improper motives he might have recovered as such meaning was not affected by the headnote Apparently the innuendo in the principal case was drawn so as to show damage within the meaning suggested by Lord Shaw Lord Wren bury in his dissenting opinion disapproved of the doctrine that a publisher of a false statement could in a headnote restrict the sense in which it might be understood though he might restrict the meaning of a true statement saying I should have thought the question was what the reader might or could reasonably imply from the alleged facts even if the writer told him that he the writer did not imply and did not invite the reader to imply any thing discreditable It does not seem however that either case stands for more in this respect than that the attempt to restrict the meaning in which a false or true statement might be understood should be considered with the rest in determining the resultant meaning conveyed A heading prefixed to a paragraph will be read with the rest of it and the whole taken in the ordinary meaning of the words Harvey v French 2 Tyr 585 1832 And though one part of a statement taken alone is injurious to a mans character if the jury think that the effect of that part is removed by the other part of the statement it is not a libel Chalmers v Payne 5 Tyr 766 I835 The question of privilege was not raised by the defendants who no doubt con sidered the law as settled on that point by Fleming v Newton I H L Cas 363 McNally v Oldham I6 Ir C L Rep 298 and Williams v Smith 58 L J Q B 21 which held that a bare publication of a record of judgments re corded and registered as a matter of legal or public interest is privileged still if the intention be to show that the judgments are unsatisfied at the time of publication and to warn creditors the publication is not an ordinary report of what has taken place in Public Courts and is not privileged LlBIL AND SLANDERPLACING WHITE PERSON IN COLORED WARDPlain tiffs daughter a white person having been adjudged insane was committed to the asylum operated by the defendants for treatment Soon afterward she was placed in a ward set apart for negro patients and there kept for some months also word colored was entered after her name on the records of the institution Action for damages for alleged libel Held Under 337

DOCTRINA ANTIQUA DE RERUM ORIGINIBUS LIBRI DUO LONDINI TYPIS R N IMPENSIS GUALTERI KETTILBY AD INSIGNE CAPITIS EPISCOPI IN CAEMETERIO PAULINO 1692 IN THIS TREATISE HE ENDEAVOURS TO DISCOVER WHAT WERE THE SENTIMENTS OF THE ANCIENTS CONCERNING THE ORI GIN OR BEGINNINGS OF THIS VISIBLE WORLD OF WHICH HE CONCEIVES MEN IN ALL AGES HAVE HAD A TRUE IF NOT A DI VINE KNOWLEDGE AS WELL AS OF A DIVINE POWER AND OF THE INTERMEDIATE ORDER VICISSITUDES AND ENDS OF ALL THINGS AND THAT PYTHAGORAS WAS NOT THE INVENTOR OF THE MUN DAN SYSTEM ASCRIBED TO HIM BUT THE CONVEYER ONLY OF IT FROM THE ORIENTALS  TO THE GRECIAN SCHOOLS WHERE YET IT RECEIVED LESSER IMPROVEMENT AS TO PAR TICULAR EXPLICATIONS THEN IT HAS BY THE MODERN INQUISITI ONS AS HE CONCEIVES THOUGH YET HE GRANTS THAT OUR HISTORIES OF THEIR OPINIONS ARE VERY IMPERFECT YET AS THE MAGNIFICENCE OF A STRUCTURE MAY BE JUDGED OF BY ITS RUINES SO IN GENERAL WE MAY HAVE SOME IDEA OF THEIR DOCTRINES BY THE FRAGMENTS OF THEM WHICH ARE YET TO BE FOUND IN THE GRECIAN WRITERS AS WELL HISTORICAL AS FA BULOUS OR MUTHICAL AND POETICAL BY ALL WHICH HE ENDEA VOURS TO PROVE THAT MOST OF THE ANCIENTS HELD VERY MUCH797 MUCH THE SAME NOTION CONCERNING THE BEGINNING OF THINGS WITH THAT DELIVERED BY MOSES IN THE BEGINNING OF HIS WRITINGS WITH WHICH HE CONCEIVES ALSO THAT HIS ALREA DY PUBLISHD THEORY IS CONSONANT IT WAS HIS DESIGN ALSO TO HAVE WRITTEN A GENERAL BODY OF PHILOSOPHY BUT THE SENSE OF HIS AGE AND APPROACHING DEATH SEEMS TO HAVE MADE HIM DESIST AND TO SATISFIE HIMSELF WITH WHAT HE HATH HITHERTO PERFORMED IN THE PRECEDING BOOKS AND IN THIS WHICH HE SEEMS TO MAKE THE SEAL AND CONSUMMATION OF THE FORMER HE DIVIDES THE WHOLE DISCOURSE INTO TWO BOOKS IN THE FIRST HE ENDEAVOURS TO DISCOVER WHAT WERE THE MOST ANTIENT DOCTRINES OF ALL NATIONS CONCERNING THE BEGINNINGS OF THINGS IN GENERAL BUT IN THE SECOND HE ENDEAVOURD TO COLLECT ALL SUCH PASSAGES AMONGST THEM AS SEEMED MOST CONSONANT TOAND CONFIRMING OF THE DOCTRINES DELIVERED IN THE FIRST PART OF HIS THEORY WHERE HE HAD OMITTED TAKING NOTICE OF THEM THOUGH IN THE SECOND PART HE HATH INTER MIXED THEM WITH THE THEORY THROUGHOUT WHICH THERE FORE DID NOT NEED ANY SUCH A SUPPLEMENT IN THE FIRST CHAPTER HE ENQUIRES WHENCETHIS KNOWLEDGE IS TO BE FETCHT WHICH HE CONCEIVES TO BE ALL FROM THE POSTDILUVIAN RECORDS WHICH WERE ALL CONVEYED BY NOAH FROM THE ANTIDILUVIAN AND DISPERSED AMONGST HIS POSTERI TY NEXT HE ENQUIRES WHERE ANY FOOTSTEPS ARE TO BE FOUND OF IT AMONG THESE AND SINCE HE FINDS THE ANCIENTS DI VIDED THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD INTO FOUR HEADS COM PREHENDING THE WHOLE RACE OF MANKIND TO WIT THE SCY THIANS TOWARDS THE NORTH THE CELTI TOWARDS THE WEST THE AETHIOPIANS TOWARDS THE SOUTH AND THE INDIANS TO WARDS THE EAST HE FOLLOWS THE SAME ORDER IN HIS EN QUIRY AND AMONGST THE FIRST HE FINDS NO ANCIENT FOOT STEPS OF THEIR PHILOSOPHY AND DOUBTS WHETHER EVER THEY HAD ANY THO ABARIS IS SAID BY SUIDAS TO HAVE WRITTEN A THEOGONIA AND A SEPTENTRIONAL MYTHOLOGY HATH BEEN OF LATE PUBLISHED FAVOURING MUCH OF ANTIQUITY K K AMONGST798 AMONGST THE CELTI HE FINDS PHILOSOPHY TO HAVE BEEN ALL ALONG VIZ AMONG THE DRUIDS AND SEMNOTHEI OF WHOM YET WE HAVE BUT A DARK ACCOUNT THAT THEY PROFESSD TO UNDERSTAND THE ORDER AND MOTIONS OF THE HEAVENS AND THE WILL OF THE GODS AND THAT STRABO SAYS THEY TAUGHT THE WORLDS PERIODS BY WATER AND FIRE AND HELD A TRAUSMIGRATION OF SOULS AS THE PYTHAGOREANS THO THEY ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE MUCH PRECEDED HIM AND TO HAVE BEEN THE MOST ANCIENT FOR MYTHOLOGICK THEOLOGY OF THIS CLASS WERE WHAT PHILOSOPHERS WERE TO BE SOUND ANCIENTLY AMONG THE GERMANS BRITAINS SPANIARDS AND ITALIANS OF SOME OF WHICH STRABO AFFIRMS THAT THEY HAD POEMS OF THEIR LAWS C OF 6000 YEARS STANDING THOSE AMONG THE HETRUSCI DIODORUS SICULUS SAYS STUDIED PHILOSOPHY AND PLUTARCH SAYS THEY HAD THE NOTION OF THE ANNUS MAGNUS OR PERIODS OF REVOLUTIONS AND THAT THE ROMANS HAD THEIR SACRED RITES FROM THEM AMONG THE AETHIOPIANS THE GYMNOSOPHISTS WERE FAMOUS BUT WE CAN FIND VERY LITTLE INFORMATION WHAT THEIR PHILOSOPHY WAS THEY WERE CELEBRATED INDEED FOR THEIR LAWS GOVERNMENT AND CONVERSE WITH THE GODS AND HAD A VERY AN CIENT USE OF LETTERS AND HAD COLLEDGES OF PRIESTS WHICH TAUGHT PHILOSOPHY AND THEOLOGY THESE ARE SAID BY LUCIAN TO HAVE BEEN THE FIRST ASTRONOMERS AND TO HAVE TAUGHT THE AEGYPTIANS BUT AS TO THE THEORY OF THE EARTH THERE IS NOTHING OF THEIRS TO BE FOUND AND INDEED MOST OF THE ANCIENT AUTHORS THAT WRIT PURPOSELY OF THEM ARE NOW NO MORE TO BE FOUND HAVING PASSD OVER THESE THREE HEADS WITHOUT MAKING MUCH DISCOVERY TO HIS PURPOSE HE IN THE THIRD CHAPTER COMES TO THE ORIENTALS OR INDIANS COMPRE HENDING ALL THE ASIANS AND SOME OF THEIR NEIGHBOURS AS THE AEGYPTIANS AND GREEKS HE BEGINS THEN WITH THE MOST EASTERN NATION THE SERI OR CHINESES CILSUS AND DIONYSIUS CALL THEM ATHEISTS BECAUSE THEY HAD NO IDOLTEMPLES OR WORSHIP AND BARBARIANS BECAUSE THEY HAD NO COMMERCE WITH OTHER NATI ONS SO THAT IT SEEMS LITTLE OF THEIR LEARNING WAS KNOWN TO THE ANCIENTS THOUGH OF LATE YEARS THEY HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER KNOWN TO HAVE VERY ANCIENT HISTORIES AND SOME THAT MENTION THE FLOOD AND THE BEGINNINGS OF THINGS BUT BY WHAT WE CAN LEARN THEIR PHYSIOLOGY IS MUCH INFERIOUR TO WHAT WAS KNOWN IN THE WESTERN PARTS AS WAS ALSO THEIR MATHEMATICKS BEING ALL OF THEIR OWN PRODUCTION AND NOT BORROWED FROM ANY BESIDES CONTRARY TO THAT OF THE GREEKS ROMANS AND OTHER EUROPEANS WHO DERIVED ALL FROM OTHERS PASSING FROM THESE TO THE SOUTH HE MEETS WITH THE BRACHMANS PHILOSOPHERS CELEBRATED IN ALL AGES FOR THEIR DEVOTING THEMSELVES WHOLLY TO CONTEMPLATIONS OF UNKNOWN ORIGINAL BUT YET WORTHY TO BE MORE DILIGENTLY ENQUIRED INTO BOTH FOR THEIR EMINENCY IN PHYSIOLOGY AND ASTRONOMY THOUGH BOTH WERE WRAPPED UP AND VAILED UNDER MYTHOLOGY YET THEY HAD SOME NOTIONS CON CORDANT WITH THE GREEK STRABO ALSO SAYS THAT THEY HELD THE WORLD TO HAVE BEEN GENERATED AND WAS CORRUPTIBLE THAT IT WAS FORMD OUT OF WATER BUT THE REST OF THE UNIVRESE FROM OTHER PRINCIPLES THE CHIEF OF THESE WERE MOST HONOURED AND ABSOLUTELY FREE NEITHER GOVERNING NOR GOVERNED BY ANY THIS IS THE SUM OF WHAT CAN BE FOUND AMONGST THE ANCIENTS CONCERNING THEIR NATURAL PHILOSOPHY IN THE FOURTH CHAPTER HE ENQUIRES CONCERNING THE ASSYRIANS AND BABYLONIANS WHO WERE THE FIRST EMPIRE AFTER THE FLOOD THESE ARE ACCOUNTED THE FIRST WHO CULTIVATED LITERATURE AND HAD PUBLICK SCHOOLS AT BABYLON WHICH CON TINUED SO TILL THE TIME OF NEBUCHADONOZER AND DANIEL THESE LEARNED MEN WERE799 WERE CALLD CHALDEANS AND MAGI AND THE CHIEF OF THEM WERE PHYSIOLOGERS AND ASTRONOMERS AND STUDIED LAWFUL ARTS AS MAY WELL BE CONCLUDED FOR THAT DANIEL ACCEPTED THE PRESECTURE OF THEM THESE EXCLUDED THE ASTROLOGI ANS AND DIVINERS FROM THEIR HABITATIONS TO THESE PYTHAGORAS RESORTED TO LEARN THE MOTIONS OF THE HEAVENS AND THE ORIGINAL OF THE WORLD SAITH JU STINE  AND  THESE WERE THEN UNDER THE PERSIANS BUT THE REMAINDERS OF THE CHALDEANS AND BABYLONIANS HOWEVER NOTHING IS LEFT OF THEIR OPINIONS BUT WHAT DIODORUS HAS HINTED THAT THEY BELIEVED THE MATTER OF THE WORLD ETERNAL BUT ITS FORM ORDER AND ORNAMENT TO BE CON STIEUTED BY DIVINE PROVIDENCE AND FURTHER THAT THEY BELIEVED THE EARTH TO BE OF THE FORM OF A SCHIFF OR TRAY ONLY HE SPEAKS OF THEIR ANTIQUITY AND OF MAKING ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS MANY AGES BEFORE ALEXANDER THIS IS ALL THAT IS INTELLIGIBLE ALL THE REST CONCERNING THEIR ORACLES OF ZIROASTER C IS NOTHING BUT CANTING AND A JARGON OF SCRAPS OF WE KNOW NOT WHO TIS PITY WE HAVE LOST THE WORKS OF BEROSUS WHO HAD WRITTEN THEIR OPI NIONS IN THE FIFTH CHAPTER HE SPEAKS OF THE PERSIAN MAGI WHO CULTIVATED PHYSI OLOGY AS WELL AS THEOLOGY THESE HAD A THEOGONIA LIKE THE GREEKS AND FROM THESE PYTHAGORAS LEARNT THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD AND THE MOTIONS OF THE HEAVENS THESE TAUGHT LIKEWISE THE PERIODS AND RENOVATION OF THE WORLD THE PRINCE OF THESE MAGI WAS ZOROASTER OF WHICH HE JUDGES THERE WERE TWO THE PERSIANS HELD THE ELEMENTS STARS AND THE HEAVENS TO BE GODS AND WORSHIPPED MOST THE SUN AMONG THE STARS AND THE FIRE AMONG THE ELE MENTS AND UNDER THE NATURE OF JUPITER THEY COMPREHENDED THE WHOLE CIR CUIT OF HEAVEN THEY AS WELL AS THE GREEKS ROMANS AND HEBREWS CON TINUALLY NOURISHD THE FIRE AND THE EGYPTIANS AS WELL AS OTHER NATIONS MUCH HONOURED IT THE PERSIANS SUPPOSED THIS FIRE TO HAVE FALLEN FROM HEAVEN AND THE STOICKS CALLD IT JUPITER INTO WHICH ALL THINGS RESOLVED THUS THEIR THEOLOGY WAS PHYSEOLOGY AND ALL THEIR OTHER RITES MAY BE IN THE SAME MAN NER RESOLVED OF WHICH HERODOTUS HAS GIVEN A PLAIN ACCOUNT IN WHICH HE PARTICULARLY TAKES NOTICE THAT IN THEIR SACRIFICING THEY SUNG THEIR THEOGONIA WHICH OUR AUTHOR CONCEIVES TO BE OF THE ORIGINATION OF THINGS OF ZORO  PLINY RELATES THAT HE LEFT TWO MILLIONS OF VERSES EXPOUNDED BY HER MIPPUS THE ARABIANS MENTION TWELVE VOLUMES EACH FILLING A WHOLE BULLS HIDE OF THE WRITINGS OF ZOROASTER TO BE LEFT TO THE MAGI SUIDAS MEN TIONS DIVERS BOOKS OF THE SAME CONCERNING DREAMS AND ASTRONOMICAL PRO DUCTIONS AND FOUR BOOKS OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY BUT ALL ARE LOST AND WHAT GOES UNDER HIS NAME ARE ALL FICTITIOUS EXCEPT ONE FRAGMENT PRESERVED BY PLUTARCH OUT OF THEOPEMPUS ANOTHER BY PORPHYRIUS IN ANTRO NYMPHARUM OUT OF EUHULUS AND A THIRD BY EUSEBIUS OUT OF A PERSIAN BOOK WHICH HE WILL HAVE ZOROASTERS AS THE BEGINNING OF THESE MAGI WAS UNKNOWN SO WAS THEIR END YET SOME REMAINED TO THE TIME OF ALEXANDER AND TIS BELIEVED THEY FELL WITH THE PERSIAN EMPIRE AND ALL THAT HAD BEEN WRITTEN CONCERNING THEM IS ALSO PERISHD SUCH WERE HERMIPPUS SMYRNAEUS PALLAS OSTHANES EU BULUS THEODORUS MOPSUESTENUS HERMODORUS PLAONICUS ANTESTHENES OR RHO DONIS ZANTHUS  SOTIONES DINON THEOPOMPUS EUDEMUS RHODIUS AND CLEARCHUS SOLENSIS L L 2 IN800 IN THE SIXTH CHAPTER HE ENQUIRES AFTER WHAT IS TO BE MET WIRHAMONG THE ARABIANS AND PHAENICIANS THE FIRST IS JOB WHOM HE MAKES AN ARABIAN BEFORE THE TIME OF MOSES WHO HAD THE KNOWLEDGE OF LETTERS AND OF THE HEAVENS AND MANY OTHER PARTS OF THE CREATION BESIDES THAT OF THE WOR SHIP OF THE TRUE GOD THIS KNOWLEDGE LASTED TO THE TIME OF SOLOMON AS APPEARS BY THE QUEEN OF SHEBA NAY TILL THE BIRTH OF CHRIST AS APPEARS BY THE MAGI THAT CAME TO WORSHIP HIM THE ZABII HE MAKES TO BE SOME OF THE ANCIENT ARABS AMONG WHOM ABRAHAM WAS BRED THESE BOAST OF HAVING THE RELIGION OF NOAH TO THESE PORPBYRY SAYS PYTHAGORAS WENT AND P LINY AFFIRMS THE SAME OF DEMOCRITUS BUT THESE SINCE THAT TIME HAVE DEGENERA TED AND HAVE TAKEN UP THE GRECIAN LEARNING THOUGH THEY HAD ALSO TRANSLATED INTO THEIR LANGUAGE THE ANCIENT LEARNING OF THE EGYPTIANS PERSIANS AND CHALDEANS BUT THESE WERE BURNT BY THE SARAZENS WHAT WRITINGS YET REMAIN AMONG THEM ARE THOUGHT NOT OLDER THAN EIGHT OR NINE HUNDRED YEARS THE  AMONG THE ANCIENT ARABS HELD THE WORLD ETERNAL AND THE SOUL MORTAL HENCE THEIR PROVERB UTERI PARIUNT SEPULCHRA DEGLUTIUNT THE WOMB MAKES THE TOMB TAKES NEXT FOR THE PHAENICIANS HE FINDS THEM VERY AN CIENT AND EARLY KNOWING IN LETTERS ARITHMETICK ASTRONOMY PHYSIOLOGY NAVIGATION FOREIGN TRADE AND PLANTING THALES AND ZENO WERE PHAENICIANS AND TO THEM WENT DIVERS OF THE GREEK PHILOSOPHERS STABO SAYS THAT MOSCBUS FOUND THE HYPOTHESIS OF ATOMES BEFORE THE TROJAN WAR THE PHILOSOPHY BE FORE THE TROJAN WAR WAS ALL BY TRADITION BUT AFTER THAT CAME IN THE RATIONAL AND DISPUTATIVE NOTHING REMAINS OF SANCHONIATHONS PHILOSOPHY BUT THAT HE HAD STUDIED THE KOSMOGONIAN OF TAAUTES DEDUCING THE WORLD FROM THE ANCIENT CHAOS AND A PRECEDENT  OR MATTER HE WROTE ALSO DIVERS OTHER PHILOSO PHICAL THINGS BUT THEY AS WELL AS ALL THE OTHER AUTHORS THAT WROTE OF THE PHAENICIANS AS THEODOTUS HYPSICRATES AND MOCHUS HESTIEUS AND HIERONIMUS EGYPTIUS ARE WHOLLY LOST IN THE SEVENTH CHAPTER HE ENQUIRES WHAT FOOTSTEPS OF ANCIENT PHYSICAL LEARNING IS TO BE MET WITH AMONG THE HEBREWS AND IN THEIR CABALA FIRST HE NOTES THAT LACTANTIUS WONDERD WHY PYTHAGORAS AND PLATO WENT TO THE EGYPTIANS FOR KNOWLEDGE BUT NOT TO THE HEBREWS WHICH IS AN ARGUMENT THEY WERE NOT THEN CONSIDERABLE FOR THAT KIND OF KNOWLEDGE THAT IS PHYSICAL AND MATHEMATICAL WHAT THEY HAD WAS CONTAINED IN THEIR CABALA WHICH THEY PRETEND TO HAVE RECEIVED FROM MOSES BUT WHATEVER IT WERE AT FIRST IT HATH BEEN MUCH DEPRAVED WITH RABBINICAL FIGMENTS AND CHIMERAS SUCH ARE THE MYSTICAL NUMERATION BY THE LETTERS OF WORDS SUCH ARE THE MAGICAL SPELLS DERIVED ALSO THENCE SUCH THE EXPRESSING COMMON NOTIONS BY A SORT OF MYSTICAL WORDS OR CHARACTERS OR NUMBERS TO MAKE IT MORE WONDERFUL TO SUCH AS DO NOT UNDERSTAND IT WHICH WAS A TRICK MADE USE OF ALSO BY PY THAGORAS IN HIS SYMBOLS BY THE EGYPTIANS IN THEIR HIEROGLOPHICKS AND BY THE HERMETICKS IN THEIR CANT ALL WHICH IF THE VEIL WERE REMOVED WOULD APPEAR EMPTY NOTHINGS BEING OF NO OTHER USE BUT TO AMUSE THE IGNORANT AND CON CEAL THEIR OWN DEFECTS AND EMPTINESS THEY DIVIDED THEIR CABALA INTO NO MINAL AND REAL THE NOMINAL WAS TRIPLE GEMMATRIA NOTARICON AND THEM MURA PAINLY MODERN AND BARBAROUS NAMES ALL CONSISTED IN SHUFFLING THE LETTERS OF WORDS MIXED WITH NUMBER REUCLIN YET SAYS THAT THE JEWS AFFIRM THAT THEREBY MAY BE SOUND OUT ALL THE KNOWLEDGE OF MOSES AND SOLOMON AS801 AS WELL DIVINE AS HUMANE AND THAT SOLOMON HIMSELF RECEIVED ALL HIS KNOW LEDGE THEREBY THE REAL CABALA THEY MAKE TWOFOLD I E THE DOCTRINE OF SEPHIROTH AND THE DOCTRINE OF THE FOUR WORLDS THEY MAKE 10 CABALISTICK  VIZ THE CROWN 2 WISDOM 3 PRUDENCE 4 MAGNIFICENCE 5 SEVERITY 6 PULCHRITUDE 7 VICTORY 8 GLORY 9 FOUNDATION 10 KINGDOM BY WHICH WHAT THEY MEAN THE AUTHOR UNDERSTANDS NOT THEY PRETEND THEY ARE EMANATIONS FROM GOD AND THAT THEY ARE NUMBERS EMANATING FROM THE INFINITE VERITY HE SPENDS SOME TIME IN EXAMINING EACH AND THEIR BRANCH INGS OUT INTO DIVERS OTHER SUBDIVISIONS BUT UPON THE WHOLE HE CONCLUDES THAT THE FURTHER HE PROCEEDS THE MORE OBSCURITY AND CONFUSION HE MEETS WITH NEXT HE EXAMINES THE DOCTRINE OF THE FOUR WORLDS TO WIT AZILATH BRIAH JETZIRAH ASHIAH I E THE WORLDS OF EMANATION CREATION FORMATION AND OF THE FABRICK BEFORE ALL WHICH THEY PUT THE ENSOPHICK OR INFINITE WORLD FROM WHICH ALL THE OTHER DO SPRING UPON A MORE DELIGENT ENQUIRY INTO THE CONTENTS OF THESE MYSTICK DOCTRINES THE AUTHOR SEEMS TO THINK THEM ALL CHEARS AND CONCLUDES WITH THE WORDS OF CHRIST MEN LOVE DARKNESS RA THER THAN LIGHT BECAUSE THEIR DEEDS ARE EVIL EVERY ONE THAT DOTH EVIL HA TETH THE LIGHT LEFT HE SHOULD BE DISCOVERED BUT HE THAT DOTH TRUTH COMETH TO THE LIGHT THAT HIS DEEDS MAY BE MANIFEST SUSPECTING ALL THOSE AFFECTED OBSCURITIES TO BE DEVISED BY THEM TO CONCEAL NOTHING ELSE BUT THEIR OWN IGNO RANCE AND DECEIT THE AUTHOR PROCEEDS FURTHER WITH EXAMINING OTHER PARTS OF THE CABALA BUT UPON THE WHOLE HE FINDS NOTHING RATIONAL OR CONTAINING ANY REAL KNOWLEDGE BUT HE CONJECTURES THAT THE MOST ANCIENT CABALA BE FORE IT WAS CONFOUNDED AND DEFILED WITH FABLES MIGHT CONTAIN SOMEWHAT OF THE ORIGINATION OF THINGS AND THEIR GRADATIONS BUT AS IT HAS BEEN IN TIME CHANGD AND AUGMENTED BY IMAGINARY FABLES AND BLINDED WITH IMPERTINENT AND NONSENSICAL EXPLICATIONS IT IS NOW BECOME A CONFUSED MASS OF INCONGRU ITIES AND ABSURDITIES BUT BY EXAMINING THESE DREGS HE CONCEIVES THAT THE ANCIENTS MIGHT HOLD THAT BEFORE THE CREATION ALL THINGS HAD THEIR BEING IN GOD AND THAT FROM HIM THEY FLOWED OR EMARATED WHEN FIRST MADE AND THAT THEY WILL ALL FLOW BACK INTO HIM WHEN THEY ARE DESTROYED WHICH HE CONCEIVES WAS ALSO THE OPINION OF THE MOST ANCIENT PHILCSOPHERS AND THAT THERE WOULD SUCCEED OTHER EMANATIONS AND REGENERATIONS AND OTHER SUCCEEDING DE STRUCTIONS AND OBSORPTIONS TO ALL ETERNITY AS IT HAD BEEN FROM ALL ETER NITY THAT NOTHING WAS PRODUCED OUT OF NOTHING AND THAT THE THINGS PRO DUCED NEVER RETURN TO NOTHING BUT ALWAYS HAVE THEIR SUBSISTENCE IN GOD WHICH SENCE IF IT DOTH NOT CONTAIN HE CONCEIVES IT MAY BE LOOKD UPON AS SALT THAT HATH LOST ITS SAVOUR WHICH IS GOOD FOR NOUGHT BUT TO BE THROWN OUT OF DOORS BUT IF IT CONTAINS ANY SOLID KNOWLEDGE IT OUGHT TO BE MANI FESTED OR CONDEMNED OTHERWISE TO PERPETUAL DARKNESS BUT LEFT IT MIGHT DECEIVE THE IGNORANT HE CAUTIONS THEM TO BE LEAD BY NO AUTHORITY THAT IS NOT DIVINE NOR BY ANY REASON THAT IS NOT CLEAR AND MANIFEST BEFORE HE LEAVES THIS HEAD HE ENQUIRES CONCERNING THE  A SECT AMONG THE JEWS NOT UNLIKE IN THEIR MANNERS TO THE INDIAN BRACHMANS ALL THAT THESE HAD OF PHILOSOPHY SAYS PHILO WAS OF GOD AND OF THE GENERATION OF THINGS BUT WHAT THAT KNOWLEDGE WAS DOES NOT APPEAR BUT HE CONCEIVES IT IS TO BE LEARNT FROM THE BRASHMANS WITH WHOM THEY AGREED FROM802 FROM THESE HE PASSES ON IN THE EIGHTH CHAPTER IN HIS SEARCH FOR THE ANCIENT LEARNING AMONGST THE EGYPTIANS WHERE HE FINDS IT VERY ANCIENT AND MUCH CELEBRATED BY THE HEBREWS WHO EXTOL BOTH MOSES AND SOLOMON THE ONE FOR KNOWING THE OTHER FOR EXCELLING IT AND BY THE GREEKS AS FROM WHENCE THEY HAD DERIVED THEIR KNOWLEDGE UPON A STRICTER ENQUIRY INTO IT HE FINDS IT TO BE FIRST GEOMETRY AS OLD AS THE OVERFLOWING OF THE NILE UPON WHICH ACCOUNT IT WAS INVENTED  BUT HE THINKS THEY WERE BUT LAND METERS AND THAT THE GREEKS AS THALES AND PYTHAGORAS DID MAKE IT SPECULATIVE 2 ASTRONOMY BUT THIS THE CHALDEANS KNEW NOR DOTH IT APPEAR WHICH WERE THE FIRST BUT HE CONCEIVES BOTH WERE VERY ANCIENT BUT RUDE AND IMPERFECT AND MUCH IM PROVED AFTERWARDS BY THE GREEKS HOWEVER HE BELIEVES THEY HAD A TRUE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SYSTEM OF THE HEAVENS AND UNDERSTOOD THE MOTIONS OF THE PLANETS C YET HE THINKS THAT THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND THEM SO WELL AS TO REDUCE THEIR MOTIONS TO CALCULATION THEY ARE SAID ALSO TO HAVE CUL TIVATED MUSICK AND PHYSICK BUT THESE ALSO WITHOUT THEORIES AND ONLY BY TRA DITION AND THO HERODOTUS SAYS THEY HAD FOR EVERY DISEASE A PARTICULAR PHYSI CIAN YET BOTH THESE WERE MUCH MORE IMPROVED BY THE GREEKS THEY ARE SAID BY OTHERS TO BE THE INVENTERS OF CHIMISTRY LASTLY THAT THEY WERE KNOWING IN PHYSICKS OR NATURAL SCIENCE THAT IS THE COSMOGONIA THEOGONIA OR THEOLOGIA WHICH THEY LOOKD UPON AS THE SAME SCIENCE THEY HELD THE EARTH TO BE FORMED OUT OF THE CONFUSED MASS OF THE FOUR ELEMENTS OR OUT OF THE CHAOS AND A TWOFOLD DESTRUCTION OF IT ONE BY FIRE ANOTHER BY WATER THAT THE EARTH WAS OF AN EGG FORM AND THAT WE CALL THE PYTHA GORICK SYSTEM WAS THE OLDEST OF ALL OTHERS BUT KEPT AMONG THEIR ARCANA THEIR MOST CELEBRATED PHILOSOPHER WAS HERMES TRISMEGISTUS THOUGH WHEN HE LIVED OR WHAT HE THOUGHT AND WRIT IS NOT KNOWN THOSE THAT BEAR HIS NAME ARE FICTITIOUS BUT AMONG THE MULTITUDE OF HIS WRITINGS HIS COSMOLOGIA MENTIONED BY PHILO BIBLIUS IS LOST THE EGYPTIANS PRESERVED THEIR LEARN ING BY THEIR PRIESTS WHO HAD COLLEDGES IN DIVERS PARTS OF EGYPT THEY HAD IT INSCRIBED ON OBELISKS AND WRITTEN IN BOOKS THE BABYLONIANS HAD CAE LESTIAL OBSERVATIONS FOR 720 YEARS  ON BURNT TYLES DEMOCRITUS TRAN SCRIBED HIS MORALS FROM A BABYLONIAN COLUMN THE COLUMNS OF HERMES IN EGYPT ARE FAMOUS ON WHICH WERE INSCRIBED HIS DOCTRINE FROM THESE THE GREEKS AND PHAENICIANS HAD MUCH OF THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND MANETHO HIS SA CRED HISTORY AMIANUS MARCELLINUS SAYS THESE COLUMNS WERE PLACED IN SUB TERRANEOUS VALUTS AND WERE THERE BEFORE THE FLOOD MANETHO AND JOSEPHUS ASSERT THE SAME OF THEIRS BOTH POSSIBLY THE SAME IN THEIR BOOKS WERE WRIT TEN THEIR LAWS THEIR HISTORY AND THEIR PHILOSOPHY SOME THINGS WERE COM MUNICABLE OTHERS WERE ARCANA NOT TO BE DEVULGED THEY HAD ALSO A TWOFOLD WAY OF WRITING ONE COMMON ANOTHER SACRED THIS WAS WRIT TEN WITH HIEROGLYPHICKS THE BRACHMANS HAVE NOT ONLY A DIFFERENT CHA RACTER BUT A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE TO PRESERVE THEIR PHILOSOPHY THESE  WERE STRICT CONCEALERS OF THEIR SECRETS AS MANY AUTHORS COMPLAIN OF THEM NOR WAS PYTHAGORAS ADMITTED WITHOUT BEING FIRST CIRCUMCISED AND OTHERWISE QUALIFIED THE ESSENI AND OTHERS OF OTHER NATIONS AS PERSIANS SY RIANS AND INDIANS ADMINIITRED OATHS C OF SECRECY THEY FURTHER OB SCURED THEIR KNOWLEDGE BY SYMBOLS  AND FABLES IN WHICH THE GREEKS ALSO FOLLOWD THEM AS DID ALSO MOST OTHER NATIONS IN THE HISTORIES OF THEIR GODS OF WHICH KIND HE GIVES DIVERS INSTANCES AMONG THESE ARE THE803 THE MYTHOLOGIES OF THE PROPHERS IN THE OLD TESTAMENT AND THE PARABLES OF CHRIST IN THE NEW THIS MYTHOLOGICK GENIUS SALUSTIUS CALIS DIVINE AND TIS PLAIN MYHOLOGIES WERE MADE USE OF BY THE ANCIENTS TO CONCEAL THEIR KNOWLEDGE FROM THE VULGAR AND YET PRESERVE IT SAFE FOR THE LEARNED NAY DIVINE PROVIDENCE DOTH SO CONCEAL BOTH DIVINE AND NATURAL KNOWLEDGE THAT THIS OR THAT PART BECOMES KNOWN TO THIS OR THAT MAN IN ONE AGE WHICH HATH LAIN ABSCONDED TO ALL PRECEDING THIS MYTHOLOGICK WAS THE MOST ANCIENT LEARNING AMONG THE GREEKS AS HE PROVES BY SEVERAL TESTIMONIES YET WAS IT FIRST RECEIVED FROM THE EGYPTIANS THIS CAUSES HIM TO ENQUIRE WHETHER THE WORKS OF HER MES WERE SO WRIT AND HE FINDS BY A PLACE QUOTED BY EUSEBIUS THAT THEY WERE FIRST WRITTEN PLAIN THEN TURNED BY THE SON OF THABION INTO  AND THEN TRANSCRIBED INTO GREEK SO THAT PLAIN WRITING WAS BEFORE MYTHOLOGICK AND TIS PROBABLE THOSE THAT HAVE IT MYTHOLOGICALLY HAD IT BEFORE PURE AND THAT THE ADDITIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE FIRST FABLES HAVE OBSCURED IF NOT QUITE OBLITERATED THE CONCEALED SENSE HE PROPOUNDS AND ANSWERS TWO OBJE CTIONS BY WHICH HE SHEWS THE INCONSISTENCY OF MENS ACTIONS WITH THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND SO APOLOGIZES FOR THE EGYPTIAN IDOLATRY AND THEIR ASTROLO GICK AND MAGICK PRACTICES LAST OF ALL HE ENQUIRES HOW THE EGYPTIANS CAME TO LOSE THIS LEARNED STATE THEY HAD KEPT FOR SO MANY AGES WHICH HE SHEWS TO HAVE PROCEEDED FROM THEIR BEING CONQUERED AND OVERUN BY DIVERS NATIONS AS BY THE PERSIANS UNDER CAMBISES AND SOME SUCCEEDING KINGS BY WHOM IT BEGAN TO DECAY AND BY THE ROMANS WHO BURNT THE ALEXANDRIAN LIBRARY WITH WHICH THEIR LEARNING WAS ALSO MUCH DESTROYED AND BY THE CONQUEST OF THE SARACENS TOTALLY EXTINGUISHED AMONGST THE LOST HISTORIANS OF THE EGYP TIAN LEARNING MANATHO WAS THE CHIEFEST AS APPEARS BY TESTIMONIES NOW EX TANT NEXT SANCHONIATHON THEN ASCLEPIADES PETOSIRIS HECATEUS  AND CHEREMON AND MANY OTHERS THESE ARE LOSSES BUT NOTHING TO BE NAMED WITH THE LOSS OF THE LIBRARY OF PTOLOMEUS PHILADELPHUS WHEREIN MANY MYRIADS PERISHED IN A MOMENT CONTAINING THE SUM OF ALL EGYPTIAN NAY AND ALL ORI ENTAL LEARNING TOO IN ALL PROBABILITY IN THE NINTH CHAPTER HE ENQUIRES CONCERNING THE GRAECIAN PHILOSOPHY OF WHICH THAT HE MAY THE MORE FULLY GIVE YOU THE HISTORY HE PRODUCES SUFFI CIENT PROOF TO SHEW IT DERIVED FROM THE EGYPTIAN NOT THAT HE DENIES THE GRECIANS TO HAVE MUCH IMPROVED SEVERAL PARTS THEREOF THAT THEY LEARND THEIR GEOMETRY ASTRONOMY AND ARITHMETICK FROM THE EGYPTIANS CHALDEANS AND PHAENICIANS HERODOTUS PLATO ARISTOTLE DIODORUS STRABO LAERTIUS ACHILLES TATIUS AND OTHERS THEIR OWN AUTHORS DO TESTIFIE TIS SAID SEMIRAMIS WHO LIVED EIGHT HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE THE TROJAN WAR BUILT A HIGH TOWER IN BABYLON ON THE TOP OF WHICH THE ASTRONOMERS MADE THEIR OBSERVATIONS AT WHICH TIMES THE GREEKS HAD NOT THE USE OF LETTERS MOREOVER CALISTHE NES SENT INTO GREECE FROM BABYLON CELESTIAL OSERVATIONS FOR 1900 YEARS BE FORE ALEXANDERS TIME AND EPIGENES FOUND OBSERVATIONS AT BABYLON FOR 720 YEARS AND OTHERS WERE BROUGHT OF 480 AS PLINY RELATES THESE WERE INSCRIBED ON BAKED BRICKS WHEREAS THE GREEK OBSERVATIONS BEGAN WITH HIPPARCHUS AND PTOLOMY YET THOUGH THE HISTORIES WERE FURNISHD BY THE BARBARI THE REASONS OF THEIR MOTIONS WERE INVENTED BY THE GREEKS BUT THOUGH THEY IM PROVED THE MATHEMATICK ARTS YET THEY VITIATED THE PHYSICKS WHICH THEY ALSO RECEIVED FROM THEM THAT THE GREEKS HAD THESE FROM THE BARBARI CLE MENS ALEXANDRINUS AND EUSEBIUS BOTH TESTIFIE AS DOTH ALSO PORPHYRIUS AND JO SEPHUS804 SEPHUS AND DIODORUS SICULUS WHO AFFIRM THE GREEKS MOST EMINENT FOR THIS LEARNING AS ORPHEUS THALES PHERECIDES PYTHAGORAS SOLON PLATO EU DOXUS ALL SETCHT IT EITHER FROM THE EGYPTIANS OR PHAENICIANS NAY THE VERY KNOWLEDGE OF LETTERS WAS FIRST BROUGHT INTO GREECE BY CADMUS NOT LONG BE FORE THE TROJAN WAR WHEREAS LEARNING FLOURISHD IN ASSYRIA EGYPT PHAE NICIA ARABIA ETHIOPIA INDIA AND AMONG THE CELTI LONG BEFORE THAT TIME THERE WERE TWO STATES OF GRECIAN PHILOSOPHY THE FIRST WHICH WAS THE OLDEST MOST OF WHICH WAS WROTE IN VERSE TREATED OF THE COSMOGONIA OR ORIGI NATION OF THINGS BY THAMYRAS LINUS ORPHEUS MUSEUS  ALSO THALES  EMPEDOCLES PARAMENIDES AND SOME OTHERS WHOSE FRAGMENTS ARE COLLECTED BY STEEVINS IN HIS POESIS PHILOSOPHICA ALL WHICH POETICK WRI TERS DID MYTHOLOGIZE THE COSMOGONIA HOMER ONLY EXCEPTED THIS THE AU THOR PROVES BY SEVERAL TESTIMONIES AND ADDS THAT ORPHEUS WAS THE FIRST THAT BROUGHT LEARNING INTO GREECE THAT ASSERRED THE OVAL FORM OF THE EARTH THE FORM THE AUTHOR ASSIGNS TO HIS ANTIDILUVIAN EARTH THAT HE LIVED NOT LONG AFTER THE TIME OF MOSES AND WAS THE FOUNDER OF THE GRECIAN THEOLOGY ES MOSES OF THE HEBREW AND THAT BOTH ACCOMMODATED THE CEREMONIES TO THE CAPACITY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE PEOPLE THAT IS ORPHEUS INSTITUTED SUCH A RE LIGION AS HE COULD NOT WHAT HE WOULD WANTING THE DIVINE ASSISTANCE OF MI RACLES WHICH MOSES HAD HE WAS FEIGN TO MAKE USE OF MUSICK AND PLEASING MYTHOLOGICK STORIES TO ALLURE HIS PEOPLE FROM BARBARITY TO GOVERNMENT AND SOCIETY FOR WHICH PURPOSE IT WAS OF VERY GREAT BENEFIT AND GENERALLY MADE USE OF NOT ONLY BY POETS BUT LEGISLATORS AND PHYSIOLOGERS ORPHEUS EX CELLED IN ALL THESE AND FIRST TAUGHT THE GRECIANS RELIGION AND THE REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS OF ANOTHER LIFE WHICH HE PROVES BY HEATHEN AND CHRISTIAN TESTIMONIES BUT AMONG THESE MUST BE DISTINGUISHED WHAT HE TAUGHT THE VULGAR FROM WHAT WAS HIS SECRET DOCTRINE FOR THAT HE HAD BOTH THE    SUIDAS SAYS HE HELD THE HEAVENS TO BE FORMED OF THE AETHER AND THE EARTH OUT OF THE CHAOS BEFORE WHICH HE PLACED TIME AS THE MEASURE BUT HE MAKES THEM BOTH COEVAL WHEREAS OTHERS OF THE ANCIENTS SEPARATE THEM BY A MULTITUDE OF AGES EMPEDOCLES MAKES ALL THE STARS TO BE FIRES BUT ORPHEUS TO BE WORLDS THE AUTHOR SUPPOSES THE PLANETS WERE MEANT AS THE MOON WAS THEREFORE CALLED  WHICH ORPHEUS FIRST ASSERTED HABITABLE PROVED BY PROCLUS AS ALSO THAT THE OVAL EARTH WAS TO BE DESTROYED BY FIRE AND THEN TO BE RENEWED BEFORE HE LEAVES THIS HEAD HE ANSWERS THE OBJECTIONS OF CICERO AND MORE ESPECIALLY GERARD VOSSIUS WHO WOULD PERSWADE THAT THERE NEVER WAS ANY SUCH MEN AS ORPHEUS MUSEUS OR LINUS WHOSE ARGUMENTS THE AUTHOR THINKS NO WAYS COGENT OR TO BE REGARDED SINCE THERE ARE SO MANY POSITIVE PROOFS TO THE CONTRARY BOTH IN HEATHEN AND CHRISTIAN WRITERS IN THE TENTH CHAPTER HE ENQUIRES AMONG THE GREEK PHILOSOPHERS THAT SUC CEEDED ORPHEUS AND FIRST AMONGST THE IONICKS THESE ARE THE SECOND KIND OF PHYSIOLOGERS WHO WROTE EXPRESLY AND IN PROSE NOT IN VERSE AND MYTHO LOGY AS THE FORMER THESE WERE THALES AND HIS IONICKS PHERECYDES PYTHA GORAS ZENOPHANES PARMENIDES LEUCIPPUS DEMOCRITUS EMPEDOCLES PLATO AND OTHERS TO EPICURUS AND ARISTOTLE IN WHOM ENDED PHILOSOPHICK ANTIQUITY EXCEPT SOME FRAGMENTS AMONG THE STOICKS THALES WAS A PHAENICIAN BUT RE CEIVED HIS KNOWLEDGE FROM EGYPT AND WAS FAMOUS FOR GEOMETRY ASTRONOMY AND PHYSICK AND ASSERTED THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL AND FIRST WRIT A DIS COURSE OF PHYSICKS WITHOUT MYTHOLOGY OR THEOLOGY NOTHING OF HIS AS SERTION805 SERTIONS REMAINS BUT ONLY THAT ALL THINGS WERE GENERATED OUT OF WATER WHICH IS AGREEABLE TO ST PETER AND MOSES POSSIBLY MORE PARTICULARS OF HIS DOCTRINE MAY BE FOUND AMONG HIS FOLLOWERS ANAXIMANDER ANAXIMENES  ARCHELAUS ANAXAGORAS THEN MAKES A MIND TO REGULATE MATTER AND MOVE IT AND WAS THEREFORE CALLED  HE RANGES THE FOUR ELEMENTS BY GRAVITY AND IS SAID TO HAVE INTRODUCED VORTICES AS FOR THE HEAVENS THE IONIANS MUCH PROMOTED THE KNOWLEDGE OF THEM IE THEY HELD THE HEAVENLY SPACES TO BE AETHER THE STARS FIRE THE PLANETS OPAQUE BODIES THAT THE MOON HAD HILLS AND VALES AND WAS HABITABLE AND THAT IT WAS ENLIGHTNED BY THE SUN WHICH WAS A MOST PURE FIRE HE HELD ALSO THE ROTATION OF THE EARTH AS ALSO THE ANNUAL MOTION ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE WORLD AS TNEON SMYRNEUS AFFIRMS TO SHEW THE REASON WHY IT IS SO DIFFICULT TO FIND WHAT WERE THEIR TRUE THOUGHTS HE QUOTES THIS PASSAGE OF PLUTARCH THIS DOCTRINE THAT IS CON CERNING THE HEAVENS WAS NOT CELEBRATED AND FAMOUS BUT HIDDEN AND KEPT SECRET AND IT WAS DISCOURSED OF WITH GREAT CAUTION AMONG A FEW UNDER AN OATH OF SECRECY FOR PHILOSOPHISINGS CONCERNING THE HEAVENS WOULD NOT BE ENDURED BECAUSE THOSE SEEMED TO RESTRAIN AND BIND UP THE DIVINE NUMEN TO CAUSES WITH OUT REASON AND TO BLIND POWERS AND TO INVOLUNTARY EFFECTS UPON WHICH AC COUNT PROTAGORAS WAS BANISHED AND ANAXAGORAS PUT IN IRONS SOCRATES ALSO FOR THE NAME OF A PHILOSOPHER WAS PUT TO DEATH WHENCE THE AUTHOR OB SERVES THAT IN ALL AGES IT HAS BEEN VERY DANGEROUS FOR PHILOSOPHERS TO SPEAK PLAIN TRUTH AMONGST THE VULGAR IN THE ELEVENTH CHAPTER HE ENQUIRES CONCERNING THE DOCTRINE OF PYTHAGORAS AND THE ITALIC PHILOSOPHY WHERE HE FINDS THAT EITHER PYTHAGORAS WROTE NOTHING OR IF HE DID EVEN THE HISTORY OF THEM IS LOST SO THAT NOTHING OF HIS PHY SIOLOGY IS REMAINING SAVE ONLY HIS THEORY OF THE HEAVENS WHICH IS CALLED THE PYTHAGORICK SYSTEM HE PLACING THE SUN IN THE CENTRE AND THE EARTH MOVING ROUND IT THE MOON AS AN ANTICTHONE OR OPPOSITE EARTH ENLIGHTNED BY THE SUN THE COMETS TO BE ABOVE THE AIR OR BETWEEN THAT AND THE PLANETS THAT THE HEAVENS WERE FLUID AETHER AND THE STARS SO MANY WORLDS WE KNOW NOT HIS SENTIMENTS ABOUT THE COSMOGONIA OR TERRESTRIAL PRODUCTIONS FOR HE MORE BUSIED HIMSELF ABOUT CAELESTIAL SPECULATIONS AND ABOUT ABSTRACTS AND INTELLECTUALS AS DID ALSO HIS FOLLOWERS WHO TREAT OF THE ANIMA MUNDI CONSISTING IN HARMONY INDIVISIBLE AND DIVISIBLE THE SAME AND AN OTHER AS THEY PHRASE IT AND SUCH OTHER AIRY NOTIONS AS HAVE NO FOUNDATIONS IN NATURE BUT OCELLUS LUCANUS ANOTHER PYTHAGOREAN MAKES THE WORLD ETERNAL BOTH FOR MATTER AND FORM AS HE DOES ALSO THE RACE OF MANKIND BUT INDEED THERE IS LITTLE IN THIS AUTHOR THAT FAVOURS OF PYTHAGORAS HIS DOCTRINE AND PLATO DIFFERS WHOLLY FROM HIM ASSERTING THE WORLD TO BE MADE BY GOD AND TO BE CORRUPTIBLE YET IT MUST BE GRANTED THAT BOTH THE PYTHAGOREANS AND PLATONISTS INCLINE TO MAKE THE MATTER ETERNAL BUT THE FORM VARIABLE AND THEY HAD BOTH THEIR VULGAR DOCTRINES AND THEIR SECRET DOCTRINES AND THOUGH THE AUTHOR CANNOT FIND ANY BUT COMMON SENSE IN HIS MYSTICAL NUMBERS YET HE THINKS THERE MIGHT BE SOME WHAT MORE WHICH IS NOW LOST TO MANKIND THE CHIEF OF THESE WAS HIS TE TRACTIS THE SEVENTH WAS NOT IGNOBLE BUT THE TENTH THE NOBLEST AND MOST PER FECT OF ALL BUT OF THE REASON AND SIGNIFICATION OF THESE NEITHER ANY OF THE ANCIENTS NOR MODERNS GIVE ANY SATISFACTIVE SOLUTIONS OR EXPLICATIONS YET ALL THE ANCIENTS ASSERT THIS TO BE THE DOCTRINE OF PYTHAGORAS AND THEREFORE AFTER HAVING RUN OVER MANY OF THEIR THOUGHTS THE AUTHOR THINKS THAT NUMBERS WILL M M PRODUCE806 PRODUCE NOTHING BUT NUMBERS NOT THINGS AND THAT CONVERTING THINGS ALL TO ARITHMETICAL OPERATIONS WAS IN THE PYTHAGOREANS AND PLATONISTS A FAILURE NOT UNLIKE THAT OF THE PERIPATETICKS OF TURNING ALL INTO LOGICAL TERMS PHERECIDES PYTHAGORAS HIS MASTER WRIT A THEOGONIA AND EMPEDOCLES ONE OF HIS SCHO LARS ASSERTED THE SUN TO BE A MASS OF FIRE AND THE STARS TO BE FIERY AND THE EARTH MADE OF THE FOUR ELEMENTS UNITED BY LOVE AND SEPARATED BY STRISE TIS UNCERTAIN WHETHER PYTHAGORAS WROTE OR NO BUT CERTAIN THAT PHILOLAUS AR CHYTAS AUD EUDOXUS DI AND TIS SAID PLATO BOUGHT THREE BOOKS OF PHILOLAUS WHENCE HE TOOK HIS TIMAEUS ARCHYTAS IS SAID TO HAVE WRITTEN MANY THINGS BUT ALL ARE LOST BUT A FRAGMENT ABOUT MATHEMATICKS EUDOXUS ALSO AND EM PEDOCLES BUT ALL ARE NOW LOST THE WRITINGS ALSO OF ARISTOTLE CONCERNING THE FOUR PYTHAGORICK ELEMENTS ARE LOST AND SOME OTHERS SO ARE THE WRITINGS OF ARISTOXENUS HERACLIDES NEANTHES HERMIPPUS SYRIANUS DIDYMUS AND EUDOXUS ALSO MODERATUS GADITANUS ALEXANDER POLYHISTOR ANDROCIDUS AND OTHERS IN THE TWELFTH CHAPTER HE ENQUIRES CONCERNING THE OPINIONS OF THE ELEATICK SECT AND OF THE STOICKS THIS SECT WAS FOUNDED BY ZENOPHANES IN THE TIMES OF ANAXIMANDER AND CONSISTED OF A MIXTURE OF VARIOUS NATIONS AND OPINIONS THE DOCTRINE HE HELD WAS THAT THERE WERE INFINITE SUNS AND INFINITE MOONS LIKE OURS WHICH HE SAID WAS HABITABLE BUT THAT THEY WERE ALL ETERNAL PAR MENIDES HELD THEM TO BE FORMED OUT OF FIRE AND EARTH AND MEN OUT OF CLAY THEY AGREED MUCH WITH THE IONICK SECT LEUCIPPUS AND DEMOCRITUS WERE OF THIS SECT WHO INTRODUCED ATOMS LEUCIPPUS ACKNOWLEDGED THE MOTION OF THE EARTH ON ITS AXIS AND THAT WHEN THE FLUID MASS SETLED INTO A GLOBE IT WAS COVERED BY A DRY SKIN WHICH GROWING THICKER FORMED THE HABITABLE EARTH HE SUPPOSES THE AXIS ALSO AT FIRST RIGHT BUT ALTERED AFTERWARD BOTH WHICH ARE CONSONANT TO THE AUTHORS THEORY DEMOCRITUS WAS AN AUDITOR OF LEUCIPPUS AND HAD TRAVELLED PERSIA ARABIA ETHIOPIA EGYPT AND INDIA TO IMPROVE HIS KNOWLEDGE AMONG THE LEARNED OF THOSE COUNTRIES AND HAS WRITTEN MANY BOOKS THOUGH ALL LOST TIS SAID HE AFFIRMED THE MOON TO BE A FIRED BODY BUT WITH MOUNTAINS HILLS AND VALES BUT THE AUTHOR SUPPOSES ONLY FIERY MOUN TAINS SUCH AS ARE ON THE EARTH CALLIMACHUS WROTE OF HIS OPINIONS THE OPINION OF THE STOICKS IS FAMOUS FOR THE FUTURE CONFLAGRATION OF THE WORLD BUT LITTLE IS TO BE FOUND CONCERNING THE PRODUCTION OF IT YET THEY ASSERTED GOD TO BE THE AUTHOR OF IT BUT TO THIS THEY JOYN MATTER MIXT AND OF IT SELF WITHOUT MOTION THIS WAS PERISHABLE BY THE CONFLAGRATION BUT THE DIVINE PRINCIPLE ETERNALAS THEY ESTEEMED ALSO THE MATTER IT SELF THOUGH THE FORM PE RISHED SO THE UNFORMED WORLD THEY MADE ETERNAL BUT THE FORMED TO HAVE BOTH BEGINNING AND END THEY HELD MOREOVER OF FORMED BODIES THE FIRE TO BE FIRST AND OUT OF THAT TO BE MADE THE OTHER ELEMENTS WHICH AGAIN WERE RESOLVABLE INTO IT CONCERNING THE MUNDANE PERIODS AND THE FATE OF THE STOICKS LITTLE NEED BE SAID IN THIS DISCOURSE IT BEING WELL KNOWN MANY BOOKS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY AND CONCERNING THEM BUT ALL LOST YET TIS SAID THERE IS ONE ANCIENT BOOK OR PIECE OF APOLLONIUS TYRIUS YET EXSTANT IN SOME LIBRARY BUT NOT PUBLISHED CONCERNING THE OPINION AND WORKS OF ZENO IN THE THIRTEENTH CHAPTER HE ENQUIRES AMONG THE PLATONICKS ARISTOTELIANS AND EPICUREANS FIRST HE FINDS THE PLATONICKS LIKE THE PYTHAGOREANS TO BE MOST TAKEN UP IN HIGH SPECULATIONS OF ABSTRACT NOTIONS AND IN ASSIGNING CAUSES OF807 OF THINGS TO NUMBERS AND GEOMETRICAL FIGURES THUS PLATO IN HIS  MAKES NOTHING VISIBLE BUT FIRE NOTHING TANGIBLE BUT EARTH BETWEEN THESE TWO FOR THEIR OWN UNION ARE PLACED AIR AND WATER THE SOLID BODIES HE SUP POSETH MADE UP OF TRIANGLES FIRE HE MAKES OF PYRAMIDS CONSISTING OF FOUR TRIANGLES THE EARTH OF CUBES CONSISTING OF SIX SQUARES AND EACH SQUARE OF FOUR TRIANGLES THE AIR OF OCTOTEDRONS EACH SIDE DIVIDED INTO SIX SCALENES THEN THE WATER OF  CONSISTING OF TWENTY TRIANGLES EACH MADE UP OF SCALENES TO THESE HE ADDS A SOUL CONSISTING OF NUMBERS AND PROPORTIONS THE BEST INTERPRETATIONS YET EXTANT CONCERNING IT DO NOT MAKE SENSE OR REASON OF IT AND AT BEST THE AUTHOR THINKS IT BUT A LUSUS INGENII FURTHER HE MAKES GOD AND MATTER TO BE THE TWO FIRST PRINCIPLESTO WHICH HE ADDS A THIRD OF IDEAS BUT PLATOS EXCELLENCY WAS NOT FOR PHYSICKS BUT FOR MORALS AND THEOLOGY DIVERS WRITINGS OF THE PLATONISTS ARE OUT AND SOME LOST BUT THESE HE PASSES BY SINCE WE HAVE THE WORKS OF PLATO HIMSELF AND NOW COMES TO THE DREGS OF PHILOSOPHY AMONGST THE EPICUREANS AND PERIPATETICKS FROM PLATOS TIME TO THE PRESENT AGE HE FINDS NOTHING OF PHILOSOPHY NOTHING OF DISCOVERY NO THING BUT A CHATTERING AND FRUITLESS METHODS OF WRANGLING CONCERNING THE ORIGINATION OF THINGS THERE IS NOTHING FOUND TO BE MET WITH IN ARISTOTLE OR HIS SCHOOLS THEY WOULD MAKE THE WORLD ETERNAL BOTH FOR MATTER AND FORM MEN ALSO AND ALL THINGS ELSE TO BE SO TOO BESIDES HE DOES NOT AGREE WITH HIS OWN PRINCIPLES DESPOSING THE FOUR ELEMENTS ONE ABOVE THE OTHER BUT SHEWS NOT HOW THE EARTH SEEMS TO BE IN SOME PARTS HIGHER THAN THE WATER THEN FOR THE HEAVENS HE MAKES ADAMANTINE ORBS AND THE STARS LIKE GOLDENHEADED NAILS STNED TO THEM THESE ORBS INVOLVED HE MAKES TO MOVE ROUND THE EARTH IN 24 HOURS THAT IS EVERY DAY TO THIS HE INTRODUCES A CONTRARY MO TION FOR EACH PLANETARY ORB FROM WEST TO EAST THE MATTER OF THESE HE MAKES INCORRUPTIBLE BUT BELOW THE ORB OF THE MOON HE PUTS FIRE ELEMENTARY WITH OUT LIGHT OR HEAT IN THE MIDDLE REGION OF THE AIR HE PUTS THE MILKY WAY AND COMETS FOR THE EXPLICATING OF ALL OTHER THINGS ON THE EARTH HE INTRO DUCES SUBSTANTIAL FORMS AND SPECIFICK QUALITIES AS INSIGNIFICANT AS THE PYTHA GORICK NUMBERS AND HARMONIES WHICH BEING SO HE WONDERS WHY IT HAS BEEN SO LONG APPROVED OF BY THE CHRISTIAN WORLD THEN THE AUTHOR GIVING A SHORT CATALOGUE OF HIS ERRORS AND BIDS ADIEU TO HIMAS TO A BAD ASTRONOMERA WORSE THEOLOGE AND THE WORST OF ALL PHYSIOLOGERS HIS CATALOGUE IS THIS 1 THAT THE WORLD IS ETERNAL AND INCORRUPTIBLE 2 THE HEAVENS SOLID AND MOVED BY CONTRARY MOTIONS 3 THE MATTER OF THE HEAVENS DIVINE AND IMMUTABLE 4 THE STARS TO BE DENSER PARTS OF THEIR ORBS AND THE PLANERS TO SHINE BY THEIR OWN LIGHT 5 LIGHT NEITHER A BODY NOR A MOTION 6 ELEMENTARY FIRE UN DER THE MOON 7 THE GALAXI AND COMETS METEORS 8 THE EARTH IMMO VABLE IN THE CENTRE OF THE WORLD 9 UP AND DOWN TO BE FOUNDED IN NATURE IMMUTABLY 10 THE FORMS OF ANIMATE THINGS SUBSTANTIAL 11 SENSATION TO BE MADE BY INTENTIONAL SPECIES 12 RAREFACTION AND CONTRACTION TO BE MADE BY THE INCREASE AND DECREASE OF EXTENSION IN MATTER 13 PROVIDENCE NOT TO DESCEND BELOW THE MOON 14 THE SOUL TO BE  AND OF DOUBTFUL IMMORTALITY NEXT HE VISITS EPICURUS ILLITERATE YET OF NO VULGAR WIT HE ACCOMMODATED ALL THINGS TO HIS SENSES AND SO HIS NOTIONS WERE FOR THE MOST PART ABSURD AND VULGAR HE CORRUPTED ONLY THE DOCTRINES OF DEMOCRITUS AND LCIPPUS UPON THE WHOLE THE AUTHOR THINKS HIS DOCTRINES NOT WORTH CON SIDERING BUT REFERS THE READER TO GASSENDUS HE CONCLUDES THIS ENQUIRY WITH GIVING THE NAMES OF SEVERAL THAT HAVE WRITTEN OF THE OPINIONS OF THESE GRECIAN PHILOSOPHERS AND OF SOME THAT HAVE WRITTEN THEIR  OR SECRET DO M M 2 CTRINES808 CTRINES AS PYTHAGORAS ZACINTHEUS PERPHYRIUS NUMERIUS HE REGRETS THE LOSS ALSO OF MANY POLYHISTORIANS AS THEOPOMPUS PHAVORINUS AND ALEXANDER PO LYHISTOR ALSO SOME OF THE WRITINGS OF DEODORUS SICULUS AND VARRO NOW WHEREAS SOME ALLEDGE SOME FEW OTHERS THAT HAVE BEEN FAMOUS FOR PHILOSOPHY IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD YET NOT WHAT THEY KNEW OR MAINTAINED AND THERE BEING NO MONUMENTS REMAINING OF SUCH THEIR KNOWLEDGE THE AUTHOR LEAVES THEM IN THE OBSCURITY HE FOUND THEM AND THINKS HE HAS PERFORMED HIS DESIGNED UNDERTAKING TO SEEK WHAT THERE COULD BE FOUND WORTHY OF PRE SERVING AMONG THE RUINES AND RELICTS OF THE MOST ANCIENT PHILOSOPHERS MORE PARTICULARLY RELATING TO THE BEGINNING OF THINGS AND HAS LEFT NO QUARTER UNSEARCHED NOR OMITTED ANY THING WHICH HE JUDGED MATERIAL TO THIS PURPOSE THOUGH OTHER PARTICULARS NOT PERTINENT WHETHER BAD OR GOOD HE HAS OMITTED AS BEING IMPERTINENT TO END THIS DISQUISITION IN THE FOURTEENTH CHAPTER HE ENQUIRES CONCERNING THE BEGINNING OF THE BARBARICK PHILOSOPHY THAT IS WHENCE THE EGYPTIANS ETHI OPIANS CHALDEANS PHAENICIANS ARABIANS INDIANS AND OTHER ORIENTALS OBTAINED THEIR FIRST KNOWLEDGE THERE ARE TWO OPINIONS CONCERNING IT ONE THAT THEY WERE INVENTED BY THEMSELVES AND THE OTHERTHAT THEY WERE TAUGHT BY MOSES OR ABRAHAM THE AUTHOR APPROVES NEITHER OF THESE NOT THE FIRST BECAUSE HE MEETS WITH NO MENTION OF EXPERIMENTS OR OBSERVATIONS OR REASONING AND DEMON STRATIONS OR METHOD OR PARTICULAR EXPLICATIONS BUT WHAT WAS KNOWN WAS TRADITIONAL AND POSITIVE NOT THE LATTER BECAUSE THIS LEARNING WAS EMINENT LONG BEFORE THOSE TIMES FOR THAT MOSES WAS BRED UP IN THE SCHOOLS OF EGYPT AND FOR THAT THE ETHIOPIANS WERE MUCH PRECEEDING TO THE EGYPTIANS BESIDES THE INSTANCE OF JOB WHO IS THOUGHT BY THE AUTHOR TO HAVE MUCH PRECEDED MOSES FOR THAT HE TAKES NO NOTICE OF THE JEWISH LAWS CEREMONIES OR SAB BATH YET WAS HE ONE THAT WORSHIPD THE TRUE GOD AND FOR THAT THE AGE OF HIS LIFE WAS ABOVE 200 YEARS AND HE OFFERED HIS OWN SACRIFICES WITHOUT A PRIEST UPON THE WHOLE THEREFORE THE AUTHOR THINKS IT WAS CONVEYED TO MANKIND BY THE SONS OF NOAB AND BY HIM FROM THE PATRIARCHS OF THE ANTI DILUVIAN WORLD THESE ARE THE PRINCIPAL MATTERS TREATED OF IN THE FIRST BOOK IN809 IN THE SECOND BOOK THE LEARNED AUTHOR DESIGNS TO MAKE USE OF SUCH TESTIMO NIES AS HE CAN FIND AMONGST THE FRAGMENTS OF THE MOST ANCIENT PHILOSOPHY TO CONFIRM THE DOCTRINES OF HIS THEORY OF THE EARTHDELIVERED IN THE FIRST BOOK THEREOF FOR THAT HE HAS NOT THEREIN ALLEDGED SUCH TESTIMONIES TO CONFIRM IT INTERMINGLED WITH THE DISCOURSE IT SELF AS HE HAS DONE IN THE SECOND BUT FRAMED THE WHOLE FROM THE IDEA HE HAD OF THE NATURE OF THE THINGS THEMSELVES AND WHEREAS IN THE FORMER BOOK OF THIS PRESENT  HE  INQUIRED AFTER THE ANCIENT DOCTRINES CONCERNING THE WHOLE OR THE UNIVERSE IN THIS HE RESTRAINS HIS SEARCH AFTER SUCH DOCTRINES AS MORE PARTICULARLY CON CERN THE FORMATION AND FABRICK OF THE EARTH ONLY IN THE FIRST CHAPTER THEN HE FINDS THAT THE PRODUCTION OF THIS WORLD OUT OF A CHAOS WAS THE MOST GENERAL AND THE MOST ANCIENT DOCTRINE OF ALL THE LEARNED BOTH THE OLOGERS PHYSIOLOGERS AND POETS HE BEGINS WITH MOSES AND SHEWS THAT HIS TOHU AND BOHU WAS THE SAME THAT THE ANCIENTS CALLED CHAOS AND THE APOSTLE HEB 11 3 DOES SO INTERPRET IT AND MOST OF THE CHRISTIAN INTERPRETERS UN DERSTAND IT SO ALSO AS DO THE HEBREWS AS TO OTHER NATIONS THEY EITHER DE LIVER IT EXPRESLY AS THE PHILOSOPHERS OR MYTHOLOGICALLY AS THE POETS THE PHILOSOPHERS DIFFER ONLY FOR THAT SOME ASCRIBE THE FORMATION TO A MIND OTHERS TO CHANCE HE BRINGS SEVERAL PROOFS OF IT FROM PHOENICIANS EGYP TIANS GREEKS ROMANS PERSIANS AND FROM DIVERS OTHER AUTHORS VERY FAMOUS AMONG THE ANCIENTS BUT OTHERS AS ORPHEUS EMPEDOCLES AND HESIOD MADE  AND LOVE TO OPERATE IN THE SEPARATION AND UNION OF THE PARTS OF THE CHAOS IN THE SECOND CHAPTER HE ENQUIRES WHAT FORM THEY ASSIGNED TO THE PRIMO GENEAL EARTH AND WHAT ESTATES IT WAS TO UNDERGO FIRST FOR THE FORM THAT IT WAS DIFFERING FROM THE PRESENT HERE FIRST HE PROVES BY THE TESTIMO NY OF ST PETER THAT THERE WAS A THREEFOLD STATE OF THE EARTH VIZ THE PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE BY THE PAST HE SHEWS WAS MEANT THE  AND BY THE FUTURE THE NEW HEAVEN AND NEW EARTH WHICH HE PROVES BY TWO PASSAGES IN ISAIAH AND ONE IN THE REVELATION THIS HE SHEWS WAS ALSO MEN TIONED BY ST PAUL IN THE 8TH OF THE ROMANS UPON WHICH PASSAGE HE INSISTS MUCH TO PROVE THAT THE APOSTLE MEANT THIS THREE FOLD STATE OF THE EARTH AND ALLEDGES THE JUDGMENT OF THE FATHERS TERTULLIAN IRENAEUS ORIGEN HIEROM CHRYSOSTOM AND OTHERS TO CONFIRM IT AND THEN ENDEAVOURS TO ANSWER SUCH AS HAD ASSIGNED OTHER EXPOSITIONS OF THE WORD CREATION OF WHICH THERE ARE THREE SORTS ONE WOULD HAVE THE FALLEN ANGELS TO BE UNDERSTOOD WHICH HE SHEWS COULD NOT BE THE MEANING SINCE THEY ARE NOT TO BE RESTORED OTHERS WOULD HAVE BY CREATURES TO BE UNDERSTOOD MEN BUT THAT CANNOT BE THE SENSE BECAUSE THE CREATURE AND MEN ARE DISTINGUISHED IN THE VERY TEXT THIRDLY THOSE THAT WOULD HAVE THE GENTILES TO BE MEANT ARE THE FARTHEST OF ALL FROM THE PLAIN SENCE WHICH HE MAKES TO BE THE FORMED WORLD AND THAT IT IS TO PASS THOROUGH THREE STATES A FORMER A PRESENT AND A FUTURE810 IN THE THIRD CHAPTER HE BRINGS AUTHORITY TO PROVE THE PRIMIGENEAL FORM AND SITUATION OF THE EARTH AND WHEREIN IT DIFFERD FROM THE PRESENT OF WHICH THE ANCIENTS HAD MANIFEST KNOWLEDGE THE FIRST HE ALLEDGES IS THAT OF ST PETER 2 3 6 WHERE HE SAYS THE WORDS ARE OPPOSED TO THOSE WHO ASSERT ED THE STATE OF THE WORLD TO BE THE SAME AS AT FIRST AND ADDS THAT ST AU STIN IN EXPOUNDING THESE WORDS OF ST PETER DOTH SO UNDERSTAND THEM TO WIT THAT NOT ONLY THE OLD EARTH PERISHED IN THE FLOUD BUT THE HEAVENS ALSO HE NEXT ENQUIRES WHEREIN THE DIFFERENCE IS BETWEEN THE FORMER AND THE PRE SENT AND FINDS STPETER THERE DESCRIBING THE  TO ASSERT IT TO BE OUT OF THE WATER AND TO STAND BY THE WATERS THAT IS SAYS HE TO BE PLACED ABOVE THE WATERS AND BE SUSTAINED BY THEM AND BY THIS HE EXPLAINS PSAL 136 6 PROV 8 27 BUT BRINGS NO FURTHER PROOF OF HIS DOCTRINE IN THE FOURTH CHAPTER HE ENQUIRES CONCERNING THE NATURE MANNER AND CAUSES OF DELUGES BUT CHIEFLY OF THE UNIVERSAL HERE HE REPEATS WHAT HE HAS SAID CONCERNING THE QUANTITY OF THE WATER REQUISITE IN HIS THEORY AND QUOTES ALSO WHAT ISAIAH SAYS IN DESCRIBING A GENERAL DELUGE WHO MAKES A KIND OF EARTHQUAKE TO PRECEDE IT FOR THE ERUPTION OF THE WATERS OUT OF THEIR WOMB AND SEVERAL OTHER PLACES AND COMMENTATORS UPON THEM WHO ALL SEEM TO MEAN EARTHQUAKES THEN HE ENQUIRES WHAT ARE THE CAUSES OF PARTICULAR INUNDATIONS WHICH HE MAKES THREE I E 1 THE IRRUPTION OF THE SEA UPON THE LOW COUNTRIES 2 GREAT  3 ERUPTIONS OF WATERS OUT OF THE BODY OF THE EARTH BY EARTHQUAKES OF EACH OF THESE HE BRINGS EXAMPLES OUT OF HISTORY THE FIRST IS STRABOS DESCRIPTION OF THE MANNER OF MAKING THE DEAD SEA WHERE SODOM AND GOMORRAH FORMERLY STOOD BY AN EARTHQUAKE SECONDLY A PASSAGE IN AMIANUS  ABOUT THE SINKING AND DROWNING OF PLACES ANOTHER OUT OF DIODORUS SICULUS CONCERNING THE CITY OF ATLANTES AND OF STRABO FOR EUBAEA ANOTHER OUT OF ZIPHILINE IN THE LIFE OF ANTONIUS PIUS OF THE LOSS OF THE CITY OF CYZICUM ANOTHER OUT OF DIODORUS SICULUS ABOUT THE LOSS OF BURA AND HELICE ANOTHER OUT OF PAUSONIUS OF THE LOSS OF THE CITY IDEA THEN HE MENTIONS THE OGYGIAN AND DEUCALEON FLOODS OF DEUCALIANS HE REMARKS A NOTABLE PASSAGE OUT OF LUCIAN IN THE FIFTH CHAPTER HE ENQUIRES WHETHER THERE BE ANY RECORD AMONG THE ANCIENTS THAT MAY CONFIRM HIS CONJECTURE ABOUT THE RIGHT SITUATION OF THE EARTH TO THE SUN WHENCE PROCEEDED A PERPETUAL EQUINOX WITHOUT DIFFERING SEASONS FOR THIS HE LOOKS FOR THE DESCRIPTION OF THE GOLDEN AGES VIZ IN PLATOS PHAEDO WHERE HE SAYS UNDER SATURN THE MOTIONS OF THE HEAVENS WERE UNIFORM BUT UNDER JUPITER THERE WAS AN  OF THE HEAVENS TO THE PO STURE THEY ARE NOW IN WHICH WAS THE CAUSE OF ALL THE EVIL THAT FOLLOWED HE SPEAKS ALSO OF ITS RENOVATION OR BEING RESTORED TO ITS FORMER STATE OF THESE THINGS WE HAVE AN IMPERFECT ACCOUNT BY REASON OF THE LENGTH OF TIME PAST BUT THESE AND GREATER OR MORE WONDERFUL THINGS HAVE HAPPENED NEXT FOR THE EARTH PLATO SAYS IT WAS EQUILIBRATE WITHOUT     FURTHER HE MAKES THE SEASONS ALL TEMPERATE WHICH GAVE MEN LONG LIVES HE MAKES ALSO AN ABYSS TO RECEIVE THE WATER TRAJECTED THROUGH THE EARTH BUT THE SURFACE OF IT HE MAKES SMOOTH AND ADORNED WITH VARIOUS COLOURS AND GEMS AS THE PROPHETS AND SACRED AUTHORS DO THE NEW HIRU SALEM IN811 IN THE SIXTH CHAPTER HE ENQUIRES CONCERNING THE CHANGED POSITION OF THE PRESENT EARTH FOR THIS HE HAS A CLOUD OF TESTIMONIES BESIDE PLATO TO WIT ANAXAGORAS EMPEDOCLES DIOGENES LEUCEPPUS DEMOCRITUS WHO  ALL SPEAK OF THE CHANGED SITUATION OF THE EARTHS AXIS WHOSE TESTIMONIES HE HAS ELSE WHERE MENTIONED AMONG THE INVENTIONS OF THE ASTRONOMERS THE OBLIQUITY OF THE ZODIACK AND THE SEASONS OF THE YEAR ARE ASCRIBED TO THALES WHICH IS AN ARGUMENT IT HAD NOT BEEN SO FROM THE BEGINNING BUT THE HISTORIES OF THE PROGRESS OF ASTRONOMY WRITTEN BY EUDEMUS AND THEON SMYRNEUS HAVE PE RISHED WHICH MIGHT HAVE AFFORDED MORE COGENT ARGUMENTS HERE HE MEN TIONS WHAT OVID VIRGIL AND HOMER HAVE SAID TO THIS PURPOSE IN DESCRIBING THE GOLDEN AGE AND THE ELIZIUM OF THE DEAD FROM THE POETS HE PASSES TO PLUTARCHS DESCRIPTION OF THE FORTUNATE ISLES WHICH IS A MORE MODERN NAME FOR THE ELIZIUM AND AGREES MUCH WITH THE PARADISICAL EARTH AND ANOTHER OUT OF DIODORUS SICULUS OF THE ISLAND TABROBANA WHICH HE SUPPOSES TO BE FOR THE SAME PURPOSE FROM THESE HEATHENS HE COMES TO THE JEWISH AND CHRI STIAN WRITERS DESCRIBING PARADISE AND THE GARDEN OF THE LORD WHO DO MUCH AGREE WITH THE HEATHEN DESCRIPTIONS OF THE GOLDEN AGE HE QUOTES IS ABARBANIL UPON THE 2D OF GENESIS AND ABEN EZRA ALSO MAIMONIDES UPON THE 10TH CHAPTER OF THE SANBEDRIM MANASSEH BEN ISRAEL ON THE CREATION AND ABRAHAM ECCHELLENSIS CONCERNING THE TESTIMONIES OF THE JEWS AND ARABIANS THEN FOR THE CHRISTIANS HE BRINGS TATIANUS HE QUOTES ALSO SUIDAS AND SUMS UP ALL WITH BELLARMINES CONCLUSION THAT THERE WAS A PERPETUAL SPRING AND ANOTHER COURSE OF THE SUN THEN AT PRESENT HE ADDS THAT ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THE SHORT AND UNCERTAIN LIFE OF CREATURES PROCEEDED FROM THE OBLIQUE MOTION OF THE SUN IN THE ZODIACK AND THAT MANTUAN SAYS IT WAS THE OPINION OF THE ANCIENT ASTRONOMERS HE ADDS ALSO A PASSAGE OF ORPBEUS PRESERVED BY PRO CLUS TO THE SAME EFFECT IN THE SEVENTH CHAPTER HE DISCOURSES OF THE DESCRIPTION WHICH MOSES GIVES OF PARADISE AND OF THE STATE OF NATURE IN THE NEW WORLD WHICH IS IN GE NERAL THAT MOSES ACCOMMODATED HIS HISTORY TO THE CAPACITY OF THOSE FOR WHOM HE WRIT AND THAT ALL HE HAS SAID IS NOT TO BE TAKEN IN A STRICT LITERAL SENSE THEN IN THE EIGHTH CHAPTER HE SPEAKS OF THE MANNER OF THE INTERPRE TATIONS OF THE EXPRESSIONS OF MOSES CONCERNING THE HEXAMERON WHICH IS CON SONANT TO HIS THOUGHTS IN THE SEVENTH AND IN THE NINTH CHAPTER HE ENDEA VOURS TO ANSWER THOSE WHO WOULD HAVE IT TO BE LITERALLY UNDERSTOOD AND IN THE LAST CHAPTER HE PROPOUNDS WHAT THINGS ARE WORTHY TO BE CONSIDERED IN OR DER TO THE MAKING A RIGHT JUDGMENT OF THE WHOLE AND MORE PARTICULARLY OF WHAT HE HATH MORE FREELY DELIVERED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTERS HE DESIRES HIS READERS THEREFORE TO CONSIDER THE USE AND STYLE OF THE EASTERN SAGES 2 THE MEAN AND DULL APPREHENSIONS OF THE ISRAELITES AT THE TIME WHEN MOSES WRIT 3 WHAT LEARNED COMMENTATORS HAVE SAID OF THIS MATTER 4 WHAT WE ARE TO THINK OF THE GREAT GOD AND WHAT THOUGHTS CONCERNING HIM ARE WORTHY AND WHAT BESEEMING AS TO THE FIRST THESE ORIENTALS DID FOR THE MOST PART DELIVER THEIR DOCTRINES IN MYTHOLOGY AD CAPTUM VULGI BUT THEY HAD ALSO A MORE SECRET DOCTRINE WHICH THEY DELIVERD ONLY TO SUCH OF THEIR SCHOOLS AS WERE OF A MORE CLEAR UNDERSTANDING SO THAT THOUGH MANY VULGAR OPINIONS HAVE BEEN ASCRIBED TO THEM YET THEY WERE SUCH AS WERE DELIVERD FOR THE VUL GAR BUT THAT THEY HAD OTHERS RESERVED FOR THE MORE INTELLIGENT SO IAMBLICUS AND LAERTIUS RELATE SOME NOTIONS OF PYTHAGORAS WHICH ACCORDED WITH THE VULGAR812 VULGAR OPINION OF THE HEAVENS YET TIS PLAIN HE HELD THE OTHER DOCTRINE THE JEWISH DOCTORS SAY THE LAW SPEAKS WITH THE TONGUES OF MEN THAT IS WITH A VULGAR STYLE YET THEY HAD THEIR CABALA TO CONCEAL THEIR MYSTERIES NOR WAS THIS FOREIGN TO THE CHRISTIAN SCHOOLS SECONDLY THE PEOPLE OF IS RAEL WHEN MOSES WRIT WERE OF DULLAND UNCULTIVATED UNDERSTANDING NOT FIT FOR NATURAL SPECULATIONS OR DIVINE CONTEMPLATIONS THUS MUCH MANASSEH BEN ISRAEL SAYS AND SO DOES MOSES MAIMONIDES THIS HE CONCEIVES TO BE THE REA SON WHY MOSES SO WROTE THE HISTORY OF THE CREATION THIRDLY COMMENTATORS BOTH JEWS AND CHRISTIANS HAVE ASSERTED THAT MANY THINGS IN THAT HISTORY ARE NOT TO BE UNDERSTOOD LITERALLY BUT ALLEGORICALLY FOR THIS BESIDES PHILO JUDE US WHO MAKES IT ALL ALLEGORICAL AND THE CABALISTS WHOM HE PASSES BY HE NAMES R MOSES EGYPTIUS FOR A SOLID AUTHOR ASSERTING IT AND JOSEPHUS AS ALSO ARISTOBULUS QUOTED BY EUSEBIUS WHO IS OF THE SAME SENTIMENT AS WERE MA NY OF THE CHRISTIAN FATHERS WHICH HE CITES AT LARGE FOURTHLY AS TO SUCHAS DO NOT ADHERE TO THE LITERAL SENSE HE ADMONISHES THEM THAT THEY DO NOT AD MIT ANY THING UNWORTHY OF GOD OR OF OUR RELIGION

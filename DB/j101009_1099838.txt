DEMURRED TO THE DECLARATION UPON TWO GROUNDS 1 THAT THE DECLARATION DOES NOT AVER THAT THE PLAINTIFF WAS THE OWNER OR OCCUPANT OF THE LAND AT THE PLACE AT WHICH THE HORSES ENTERED UPON THE DEFENDANTS RAILROAD AND THAT THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 1258 OF THE CODE OF 1887 AND THE ACTS AMENDATORY THEREOF WERE SOLELY AND EXCLUSIVELY FOR THE BENEFIT AND PROTECTION OF ADJOIN ING LANDOWNERS 2 THAT THE DEFENDANT WAS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO FENCE ITS TRACK AT ANY POINT WHERE THE SAME ADJOINED A PUBLIC HIGHWAY THE DEMURRER WAS SUSTAINED AND TO THIS JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT THE CASE IS BEFORE US UPON A WRIT OF ERROR AWARDED BY ONE OF THE JUDGES OF THE COURT IT IS INSISTED BY COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANT IN ERROR THAT THIS COURT HAS NO JURISDICTION AS THE MEASURE OF PLAINTIFF IN ERRORS DAMAGES IS 455 WITH INTEREST THEREON FROM THE DATE OF THE KILLING OF THE HORSES MAY 20 1902 AND THEREFORE LESS THAN 500 SINCE THE SUM OF 45 WHICH THE DECLARATION AVERS HE OUGHT TO HAVE FOR LOSS OF THE USE OF THE HORSES CANNOT BE RECOVERED AS OBSERVED THE TOTAL DAMAGES CLAIMED BY THE PLAINTIFF IS 0500 THE AMOUNT NECESSARY TO CONFER UPON THIS COURT JURISDICTION IN HAWKINS V GRESHAM 85 VA 34 6 S E 472 IT IS HELD THAT THE MATTER IN CONTROVERSY IS THAT FOR WHICH SUIT IS BROUGHT OR FOR WHICH THE JUDGMENT IS RENDERED AND NOT THAT WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT COME IN QUESTION AND IN COX V CARR 79 VA 28 THE RULE STATED AS CONTROLLING THE DETERMINATION OF THE QUESTION OF JURISDICTION WHERE THE CLAIM SUED ON IS A MONEY DEMAND IS IF THE CLAIM BE MERELY COLORABLE IN ORDER TO GIVE THE COURT JURISDICTION AND THAT WAS MADE TO APPEAR JURISDICTION WOULD BE DECLINED FOR JURISDICTION CAN NO MORE BE CONFERRED THAN IT CAN BE TAKEN AWAY BY IMPROPER DEVICES OF PARTIES HANSBROUGH V STINNETT 22 GRATT 593 IT FOLLOWS THEREFORE THAT WHEN THE CLAIM ASSERTED IS OF AMOUNT SUFFICIENT TO CONFER JURISDICTION UPON THIS COURT AND IT IS NOT MADE TO APPEAR THAT THE CLAIM IS MERELY COLORABLE WE ARE NOT WARRANTED IN SAYING AS A MATTER OF LAW THAT THE 45 CLAIMED FOR THE LOSS OF THE USE OF THE HORSES KILLED AND AS A PART OF THE TOTAL DEMAND MADE OF 500 AS DAMAGES IS NOT RECOVERABLE THE PRESUMPTION BEIING THAT THE CLAIM IS MADE IN GOOD

OF THE USE OF THE HORSES KILLED WAS MERELY TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF THE DAMNAGES SUED FOR TO THE MINIMUM AMOUNT NECESSARY TO CONFER JURIS DICTION UPON THIS COURT THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE HORSES COULD EASILY HAVE BEEN INCREASED TO THAT AMOUNT THE QUESTION PRESENTED ON THE DEMURRER IS WHETHER OR NOT A RAIL ROAD COMPANY IS LIABLE TO THE OWNER OF STOCK KILLED OR INJURED ON ITS TRACK BV ONE OF ITS TRAINS WHO OWNS NO LAND EITHER AT THE POINT WHERE THE STOCK IS KILLED OR INJURED OR AT THE POINT WHERE IT COMES UPON THE COMPANYS TRACK OR THE RIGHT OF WAY ON WHICH THE SAME IS CONSTRULCTED WHEN

UNDER THE PROVISIONIS OF SECTION 1258 SUCH WAS THE CASE OF TONAWANDA R CO V MUNGER N Y 49 AM DEC 272 BUT SUCH A DEFENSE CANNOT BE AVAILED OF IN AN ACTION TO RECOVER DAMAGES FOR STOCK KILLED OR INJURED

owner of stock killed or injured on its track by one of its trains although lie owned no land either at the point where the stock was killed or in jured or at the point where the stock came upon the track though the only negligence alleged was the failure of the company to fence its track as required by said sections It is likewise liable if the stock strayed upon the track from the public

Error to a judgment of the Circuit Court of Augusta county rendered January 8 1903 in an action of trespass on the case wherein the plaintiff in error was the plaintiff and the defendant in error was the defendant Reversed The opinion states the case S D Timberlake and J M Perry for the plaintiff in error Ro L Parrish  Son for the defendant in error CARDWELL J delivered the opinion of the court This action was brought by Samuel L Sanger to recover of the Chesapeake  Ohio Railway Company damages to the amount of 500 alleged to have been sustained by the plaintiff by reason of the killing of three of his horses by a train of the defendant The declaration contains two counts averring that the values of the animals killed are as follows One black horse 130 one brown mare 175 one gray mare 150 total 445 and at the close of each count there is further averment to the effect that the plaintiff is also entitled to the sum of 45 for being deprived of the use of the horses and the total damages claimed are 500 the negligence1904 SANGER V C  0 RY CO 883 alleged being the failure of the defendant to erect and maintain a fence at the point where the horse were killed The defendant demurred to the declaration upon two grounds 1 That the declaration does not aver that the plaintiff was the owner or occupant of the land at the place at which the horses entered upon the defendants railroad and that the provisions of section 1258 of the Code of 1887 and the acts amendatory thereof were solely and exclusively for the benefit and protection of adjoin ing landowners 2 that the defendant was under no obligation to fence its track at any point where the same adjoined a public highway The demurrer was sustained and to this judgment of the circuit court the case is before us upon a writ of error awarded by one of the judges of the court It is insisted by counsel for defendant in error that this court has no jurisdiction as the measure of plaintiff in errors damages is 455 with interest thereon from the date of the killing of the horses May 20 1902 and therefore less than 500 since the sum of 45 which the declaration avers he ought to have for loss of the use of the horses cannot be recovered As observed the total damages claimed by the plaintiff is 0500 the amount necessary to confer upon this court jurisdiction In Hawkins v Gresham 85 Va 34 6 S E 472 it is held that the matter in controversy is that for which suit is brought or for which the judgment is rendered and not that which may or may not come in question And in Cox v Carr 79 Va 28 the rule stated as controlling the determination of the question of jurisdiction where the claim sued on is a money demand is If the claim be merely colorable in order to give the court jurisdiction and that was made to appear jurisdiction would be declined for jurisdiction can no more be conferred than it can be taken away by improper devices of parties Hansbrough v Stinnett 22 Gratt 593 It follows therefore that when the claim asserted is of amount sufficient to confer jurisdiction upon this court and it is not made to appear that the claim is merely colorable we are not warranted in saying as a matter of law that the 45 claimed for the loss of the use of the horses killed and as a part of the total demand made of 500 as damages is not recoverable the presumption beiing that the claim is made in good faitlh and the right to its recovery is to884 9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb be determined from the facts proven As well said by counsel for plaintiff in error if the object in claiming the 45 for loss of the use of the horses killed was merely to increase the amount of the damnages sued for to the minimum amount necessary to confer juris diction upon this court the estimated value of the horses could easily have been increased to that amount The question presented on the demurrer is whether or not a rail road company is liable to the owner of stock killed or injured on its track bv one of its trains who owns no land either at the point where the stock is killed or injured or at the point where it comes upon the companys track or the right of way on which the same is construLcted when the only negligence alleged by the plaintiff is the failure of the railroad company to fence its roadbed as required by the provisions of section 1258 of the Code of 1887 as amended b the act of February 9 1898 Acts 189798 p 313 c 283 qualified by section 1259 of the Code of 1887 as amended by the act of Feb ruiary 8 1898 Acts 189798 p 279 c 250 and the decision of this questioni turns upon the construction to be given those statutes Section 1258 as amended is as follows Sec 1258 To Enclose Roadbeds with Fences Cattle Guards Everv such company shall cause to be erected along its line and on both sides of its roadbed lawful fences as defined in section two thousand and thirty eight which may be made of timber or wire or both and shall keep thbe same in proper repair and with which the owners of adjoining lands may connect their fences at such places as they may deem proper In erecting these fences the company shall at the termini of those portions of its road bed which it is required to fence and on each side of all public and private crossings construct across its roadbed and keep in good repair sufficient cat tle guards with which its fences shall be connected Such cattle guards at private crossings may with the consent of the owners of said crossings be dispensed with the company in lieu of cattle guards erecting and keep ing in good order siifficient gates But no court of this commonwealtlh shall have jurisdiction by writ of manadamus or otherwise to compel the erection of such fences or building such cattle guards Section 1259 as amended is as follows Sec 1259    The preceding section so far as it relates to fencing slhall not apply to any part of tt railroad located within the corporate limits of a city or town or between the terminals of the swivtches either way froml the companys depots nor to any part of a railroad at a place where there is a cut or embankment with sides sufficiently steep to prevent the passage of stock at such place nor shall it apply to a company which has compeli sated the owner for making aind keeping in repair the necessary fencing1904 BANGER V C  0 RY CO 885 but the burden of provring such compensation shall be upon the company and no report of any commissioners shall be received as proof thereof uniiless it shall plainly appear on the face of the report or from other evi dence in connection therewith that an estimate was made by such commission ers for the fencing and the expense of the same entered into and constituted a part of the damages reported and actually paid In section 1258 as originally enacted and as adopted into the Code of 1887 c 52 after the words Every such company shall cause to be erected along its line and on both sides of its roadbed the words through all enclosed lands or lots followed There fore the material change made by the amendment above set out is the omission of the words through all enclosed lands or lots The only change made in section 1259 by the amendment thereof supra is in the insertion of the words italicized viz or between the terminals of the switches in lieu of nor within an incorpor ated town for the distance of onequarter of a mile either way from the companys depots and this amendment is not material in the consideration of this case nor does the amendment to section 1258 of February 15 1900 Acts 18991900 p 393 c 373 affect the issue The decision of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals at Richmond Va in Newsoms Adnzr v N  W R Co 81 Fed 133 2 Va Law Reg 882 is greatly relied on by defendant in error in support of the contention that the benefit and protection con ferred by section 1258 of the Code of 1887 is limited exclusively to sutch stock owners as are also the owners or occupants of lands adjoining a railroads right of way but the argument here and that in support of the decision referred to loses its force since the legislatuire by the amendment of section 1258 supra has impera tively required railroad companies to erect and maintain fences along their lines and onboth sides of their roadbeds except at the points mentioned in section 1259 as amended supra unless the pro viso in the lastnamed section that the first naned shall not apply to a company which has compensated the owner for making and keeping in repair the necessary fencing restricts its provisions to the benefit and protection merely of the adjoining landowners The plain object and purpose of senction 1259 is to specify what points and what pointsalone along the right of way of a rail road company are to be excepted from the operation of section 1258 and while section 1259 provides that section 1258 shall not886 9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb apply to a company which has compensated the owner of adjoining lands for making and keeping in repair the necessary fencing it does not release the company from its duty to fence its right of way as required by the provisions of section 1258 but merely gives to the company the right of defense against such adjoining land owner in an action by him to recover damages for stock killed or injured upon the right of way of such railroad company In such an action section 1259 provides that the defendant company may make the defense that it has compensated the plaintiff for making and keeping in repair the necessary fencing which the railroad com pany was required to erect and keep in repair under the provisionis of section 1258 Such was the case of Tonawanda R Co v Munger N Y 49 Am Dec 272 But such a defense cannot be availed of in an action to recover damages for stock killed or injured brought by a plaintiff not owning the land adjoining the defend ants right of way at the point where the stock passed onto the track of the defendant and it has neglected the duty of fencing its road bed at that point Immediately following the decision in Newsoms A dmr v N TV R Co supra which held as we have observed that section 1258 of the Code of 1887 as it originally stood was for the protection of the adjoining landowners alone the amendment of that section men tioned above was enacted by the legislature the effect of which as we construe it is to extend the requirements of the statute to all lands inclosed and uninclosed wlich adjoin a railroads right of way The constitutionality of the statute has never been questioned in this court but very similar statutes have been reviewed in the courts of other states as well as in the UTnited States Supreme Court and in each instance the statute has been upheld on the ground that it was an exercise of the police power of the state In M71o Pac R Co v Hfumes 115 U S 512 6 Sup Ct 110 29 L Ed 463 the statute of Missouri requiring railroad companies to erect fences cattle guards etc and providing that until they did so they should pay to stock owners double the value of stock killed came under review and it was lheld not to be in conflict with the Constitution of the United States on the ground that it was enacted in the exercise of the police power of the state See also Rozzelle v Hannibal etc B Co 79 Mo 349 III Cent R Co v Trowbridge 31 Ill App 1901904 SANGER V C  0 RY CO 887 In Indiana etc R Co v Guard 24 Ind 222 87 Am Dec 327 a case very similar in its facts to the case at barit was held that an act requiring railroads to fence is in the nature of a police regu lation designed to promote the security of persons and property passing over the road and hence though the owner of the animal be not an adjoining proprietor and be guilty of negligence in per mitting it to stray upon the land adjoining the road he may recover if the company has failed to comply with the requirements of the statute In the opinion it is said The law requiring railroad companies to fence their tracks is a police regulation for the benefit of the public and therefore the fact that a railroad runs alongside of a public highway would seem to require peculiar care on the part of the company in complying with the law See also New Albany etc R Co v Tilton 12 Ind 3 74 Am Dec 195 and note and authorities cited at page 200 Where a railways right of way runs parallel to a highway the erection of a fence is required unless its erection would destroy the use of the highway as such And the company is required to erect a fence in such cases although the entire widlth of the right of way cannot be inclosed and a part of it has to be thrown into the high way Hannibal etc R Co v Rutledge Mo 19 Am  Eng R Cases 669 See also 3 Elliott on Railroads p 1833 The fact that a public highway runs along the side of the rail road track does not of itself show a valid reason why a fence should not be maintained between the road and the track but rather a stronger reason why the track should be fenced 2 Thompsons Coom on Neg p 2055 The case of Maynard v N  W R Co W Va 21 S E 733 cited by counsel for defendant in error holding that the West Vir ginia statute identical with section 1258 of our Code of 1887 before its amendment supra applies to inclosed lands only like the decision in Newsomrs Admr v N  W R Co supra has no appli cation to a case involving the construction of the statute as amended WTe are also unable to see the force of the argument for defendant in error that because the stock in this case strayed from the highwayto the railroad track it was trespassing upon the comnpanys property and plaintiff in error could not invoke the provisions of the statute requiring the company to fence its track It was clearly the object of the legislature by the amendment to section 1258 supra as we888 9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb construe it to afford protection to passengers and property passing over a railroad and to this end to require fences wherever stock or cattle were likely to stray onto the track of a railroad the section immediately following specifying the points at which it was not deemed necessary to the object in view to fence the track Such an enactment being an exercise of the police power of the state for the benefit of the public is not in conflict with any constitutional inhi bition We are of opinion that the declaration in this case sets out a good cause of action and that the demurrer thereto should have been overrLuled Therefore the judgment of the circuit court will be reversed and annulled the demurrer overruled and the cause remanded to be further proceeded

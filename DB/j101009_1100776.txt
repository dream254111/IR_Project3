CONSIDER THE BILLS OF EXCEPTION IN THEIR INVERSE ORDER THE FOURTH BILL OF EXCEPTIONS PRESENTS THE REAL QUESTION IN THE CASE TO WHICH THE ARGUMENTS BOTH WRITTEN AND ORAL HAVE BEEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY DEVOTED THAT IS WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT ERRED IN OVERRULING THE DEMURRER TO THE EVIDENCE AT THE TIME OF THE INJURY COMPLAINED OF THE PLAINTIFF WAS A BOY NOT QUITE TWELVE YEARS OF AGE HE WAS EMPLOYED BY THE DEFENDANT COMPANY TO WORK IN ITS BAGGING ROOM AS A DOFFERTHAT IS WORK ON THE SPINNING FRAMES IN TAKING OFF AND PUTTING ON BOBBINSAND HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN THIS AND OTHER EMPLOYMENT FOR SEVERAL WEEKS ADJACENT TO THE BAGGING ROOM WAS A LARGE CARDING ROOM IN WHICH FIFTYONE CARDING MACHINES WERE OPERATED THESE CARDING MACHINES WERE LOCATED IN ROWS WITH ALLEYS BETWEEN EACH ROW AND A SPACE SEVEN FEET EIGHT INCHES WIDE AROUND THE ENTIRE ROOM NEXT TO THE WALLS IT WAS NECESSAMY FOR THE EMPLOYEES IN THE BAGGING ROOM TO GO THROUGH THE CARDING ROOM TO REACH THE WATERCLOSET AND THE ROUTE USUALLY TAKEN FOR THIS PURPOSE WAS AROUND THE WALKWAY NEXT TO THE WALLS ON THE OCCASION OF THE ACCIDENT THE PLAINTIFF WAS PURSUING THIS ROUTE ON HIS WAY TO THE WATERCLOSET WHEN HE CAME UPON SEVERAL SMALL BOYS HIIS COMPANIONS FROM THE BAGGING ROOM WHO WERE PLAYING WITH THE BELT OF ONE OF THE CARDING MACHINES BY THROWING IT OFF AND ON THE REVOLVING WHEELS THE PLAINTIFF HAD NEVER ENGAGED IN SUCHI SPORT BUT IT APPEALED TO HIS CHILDISH INSTINCTS AND HE STOPPED AND BEGAN TO ENGAGE IN THE PERFORMANCE HIMSELF HE HAD HARDLY BEGUN TO DO SO WHEN HIS ARM WAS CAUGHT BETWEEN THE BELT AND THE PULLEY AND SO SERIOUSLY INJURED THAT IT HAD TO BE AMPUTATED ABOVE THE ELBOW IT IS FURTHER SHOWN THAT IT WAS A COMMON THING FOR THE BOYS ABOUT THE MILL TO PLAY WITH THE BELTS AND THAT THIS FACT WAS KNOWN TO THOSE IN CHARGE OF THE MACHINERY AND OTHER DEPARTMENTS50 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER MAY IT IS ESTABISHED BY THE TESTIMONY OF THE PLAINTIFF WHICH UNDER THE DEMURRER TO THE EVIDENCE MUST BE TAKEN AS TRUE THAT HE HAD FRE QUENTLY SEEN BOYS PLAY WITH THE BELTS AS ON THIS OCCASION THAT HE DID NOT KNOW IT WAS DANGEROUS AND THAT HE HAD NEVER AT ANY TIME BEEN WARNED AGAINST DOING SO OR RECEIVED INSTRUCTION OF ANY SORT WITH RESPECT TO THE DANGERS SURROUNDING HIM THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A PECULIAR FASCINATION IN THROWING THE BELTS OFF AND ON AS THESE BOYS WERE DOING FOR THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE MILLS TESTIFIES THAT HE HAD SEEN GROWN MEN PLAY WITH THE BELTS THE LAW PRESUMES THAT AN INFANT BETWEEN SEVEN AND FOURTEEN YEARS OF AGE CANNOT BE GUILTY OF CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE AND IN AN ACTION BY SUCH INFANT THE BURDEN IS ON THE DEFENDANT TO OVERCOME THIS PRESUMPTION BY PROOF OF INTELLIGENCE AND CAPACITY ROANOKE V SHULL 97 VA 419 34 S E 34 75 AM ST REP 791 THE DEFENDANT MADE NO EFFORT TO OVERCOME THIS PRESUMPTION INDEED AS SAID BY THE LEARNED JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT COURT SO FAR AS ANY CONIELUSION AS TO THE PLAINTIFFS INTELLIGENCE CAN BE DRAWN FROM HIS TESTIMONY IT IS OF AN UNFAVORABLE CHARACTER THE SINGLE INQUIRY HERE IS THEREFORE WAS THE DEFENDANT GUILTY OF NEGLIGENCE IN THE DISCHARGE OF ITS DUTY TO THIS LITTLE BOY THE DEGREE OF CARE DUE BY THE MASTER TO AN INFANT EMPLOYEE OF TENDER YEARS IS MUCH GREATER THAN IS DUE TO AN ADULT THAT COURSE OF CONDUCT WHICH WOULD BE ORDINARY CARE WHEN APPLIED TO PERSONS OF MATURE JUDGMENT AND DIRCRETION MIGHT BE GROSS AND EVEN CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE TOWARD CHILDREN OF TENDER YEARS THE SAME DISCERNMENT AND FORESIGHT THAT OLDER PEOPLE AND EXPERIENCED PERSONS HABITUALLY EMPLOY IN DISCOVERING DANGERS CANNOT BE REASONABLY EXPECTED OF CHILDREN OF TENDER YEARS AND THEREFORE THE GREATER PRECAUTION SHOULD BE TAKEN WHERE CHILDREN ARE EXPOSED TO SUCH DANGERS UNDER THE HEAD OF SPECIAL DUTIES OF MASTERS TO MINORS THE DUTY OF ONE WHO EMPLOYS YOUNG PERSONS IS THUS STATED IN SECTION 219 OF SHEARMAN AND RED FIELD ON NEGLIGENCE BY THE LEARNED AUTHORS OF THAT VALUABLE WORK IT IS THE DUTY OF ONE WHO EMPLOYS YOULNG PERSONS IN HIS SERVICE TO TAKE NOTICE OF THEIR APPARENT AGE AND ABILITY AND TO USE ORDINARY CARE TO PROTECT THEM FROM RISKS WHICH THEV CANNOT PROPERLY APPRE CIATE AND TO WHICH THEY OUGHT NOT TO BE EXPOSED THIS IS A DUTV WHICH CANNOT BE DELEGATED AND ANY FAILURE TO PERFORM IT LEAVES THE MASTER SUBJECT TO THE SAME LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO SUCH RISKS AS IF THE CHILD WERE NOT A SERVANT FOR THIS PURPOSE THE MASTER1904 LYNCHBURG COTTON MILLS V STANLEY 51 MUST INSTRUCT SUCH YOUNG SERVANTS IN THEIR WORK AND WARN THEM AGAINST THE DANGERS TO WHICH IT EXPOSES THEM AND HE MUST PUT THIS WARNING IN SUCH PLAIN LANGUAGE AS TO BE SURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THE DANGER FOR IT IS NOT ENOUGH THAT HE SHOULD DLO HIS BEST TO MAKE CHILDREN UNDERSTAND THEY MUST NOT BE EXPOSED TO DANGERS WHICH THEY DO NOT FULLY UNDERSTAND IN FACT BEARING IN MIND THE NATURAL FORGETFULNESS OF YOUTH HE MUST RENEW THIS WARN ING FROM TIME TO TIME AS MAY BE REASONABLY NECESSARY AND IF THE SERVANT HAS NOT CAPACITY ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THE WARNING AND APPRECIATE THE DANGER OR FOR ANY OTHER REASON DOES NOT IN FACT UNDERSTAND IT THE MASTER WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INJURV WHICH SUCH SERVANT MAY SUFFER IN CONSEQUENCE IF CONTINUED AT SUCH WORK BUT THE MASTER IS NOT REQUIRED TO POINT OUT DANGERS WHICH ARE KNOWN OR MUST BE OBVIOUS TO AND FULLY APPRECIATED BY THE SERVANT AFTER MAKING DUE ALLOWANCE FOR HIS YOUTH GENERALLY THIS QUESTION IS FOR THE JURY IN THOMPSON ON NEG 978 IT IS SAID THE LAW PUTS UPON A MASTER WHEN HE TAKES AN INFANT INTO HIS SERVICE THE DUTY OF EXPLAIN ING TO HIM FULLY THE HAZARDS AND DANGERS CONNECTED WITH THE BUSI NESS AND OF INSTRUCTING HIM HOW TO AVOID THEM NOR IS THIS ALL THE MASTER WILL NOT HAVE DISCHARGED HIS DUTY IN THIS REGARD UNLESS THE INSTRUCTIONS AND PRECAUTIONS GIVEN ARE SO GRADUATED TO THE YOUTH IGNORANCE AND INEXPERIENCE OF THE SERVANT AS TO MAKE HIM FULLY AWARE OF THE DANGER TO HIM AND TO PLACE HIM WITH REFERENCE TO IT IN SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME STATE AS IF HE WERE AN ADULT IN BAILEY ON PER INJ SECTION 2766 IT IS SAID PERSONS WHO EMPLOY CHILDREN TO WORK WITH DANGEROUS MACHINERYT OR IN DANGEROUS PLACES SHOULD ANTICIPATE THAT THEY WILL EXERCISE ONLY SUCH JUDGMNENT DISCRETION AND CARE AS IS USUAL AMONG CHILDREN OF THE SAME AGE UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND ARE BOUND TO USE DUE CARE HAVING REGARD TO THEIR AGE AND INEXPERIENCE TO PROTECT THEM FROM DANGERS INCIDENT TO THE SITUATION IN WHICH THEY ARE PLACED AND AS A REASON ABLE PRECAUTION IN THE EXERCISE OF SUCH CARE IN THAT BEHALF IT IS THE DUTY OF THE EMPLOYER TO SO INSTRUCT SUCH EMPLOYEES CONCERNING THE DANGERS CONNECTED WITH THEIR EMPLOYMENT WHICH DANGERS FROM THEIR YOUTH AND INEXPERIENCE THEY MAY NOT COMPREHEND OR APPRE CIATE THAT THEY MAY BY THE EXERCISE OF SUCH CARE AS OUGHT REASON ABLY TO BE EXPECTED OF THEM GUARD AGAINST AND AVOID INJURIES ARISING THEREFROM AND FURTHER ADDS THAT AN INFANT WHO BY52 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER MAY REASON OF HIS YOUTH AND INEXPERIENCE IS INJURED WHEN NOT PROP ERLY INTRUCTED AND WARNED AS TO THE DANGERS INCIDENT TO HIS WORK MAY RECOVER THEREFOR IN WATSON ON PER INJ SECTION 114 IT IS SAID THE DEFENDANT WILL BE LIABLE IF NEGLIGENT THOUGH IT IS THE ACT OF THE CHILD INJURED WHICH IS PROXIMATE TO HIS OWN INJURIES IF SUCH ACT IS OF A CHARACTER NIATURALLY TO BE EXPECTED OF A CHILD AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE USUAL INDISCRETIONS AND ERRORS OF JUDGMENT CHARACTERISTIC OF IMMA TURE YEARS THE STATEMENT OF THE LAW BY

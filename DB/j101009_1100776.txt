chargeable with the highest degree of responsibility for their care and pro tection He should instruct them plainly and repeatedly as to the dangers to which they are subjected and how to avoid them He should be sure that they fully underAtand and appreciate his instructions and warnings and in view of their proneness to forget the instructions and warnings should be from time to time renewed In the case at bar a boy under twelve years of age was employed in a mill where he bad to pass frequently through a room filled with machinery belts and pulleys without any warning from the master as to dangers from the machinery and how to avoid them and while playing with a belt on the moving machinery re ceived the injury complained of The master was held liable  Reported by M P Burks State

neither natural nor legal guardian and who so far as ap pears is working for his own living and receiving his own wages his loss of time is a proper element for consideration by the jury Error to a judgment of the Circuit Court of the City of Lynch burg in an action of trespass on the case wherein the defendant in error was the plaintiff and the plaintiff in error was the defendant Afflrmed The opinion states the case Ilorsley Blackford  Kemp and P H C Cabeli for the plaintiff in error Dont P Halsey for the defendant in error HARRISON T delivered the opinion of the court This action was brought by Fitzhugh Stanley suing by his next friend to recover damages from the Lynchburg Cotton Mills for injuries sustained by the plaintiff in consequence of the alleged negligence of the defendant There was a demurrer to the evidence which was overruled by the Circuit Court and judgment given in favor of the plaintiff for 5000 the damages ascertained by the jury It is insisted that bills of exception Nos 1 2 and 3 taken by the defendant are not parts of the record because the bills were not signed within thirty days fromn the adjournment of the term of the court at which the decisions were rendered to which they object Acts 1901 p 186 c 172 This position is not tenable The objections were taken and overruled at the November term 1902 Upon the demurrer to the evidence the court took time to consider and did not render its judgment until the next term Within thirty days from this last named term at which the final judgment was rendered the bills of exception in question were signed As the law stood prior to the act relied on the bills of exception could have been signed at the April term 1903 at which the final judgment was entered Ifudclins v Simnon 94 Va 659 27 S E 606 The act cited of FebruLiary 15 1901 was intended to extend the time within which bills of exception could be tendered and signed Until the final1904 LYNCHBURG COTTON MILLS V STANLEY 49 judgment is rendered the case is open for the purpose of perfecting exceptions duly taken to rulings during the trial The act extends the time in which they may be perfected for thirty days beyond the final judgment or until such time as the parties shall agree of record to extend it If the contention now made were to prevail the result would be that the act which was plainly intended to enlarge the time would be converted into a means of curtailing such rights by giving litigants less time in which to perfect their bills of exception than they had before the act was passed For convenience we will consider the bills of exception in their inverse order The fourth bill of exceptions presents the real question in the case to which the arguments both written and oral have been almost exclusively devoted that is whether or not the court erred in overruling the demurrer to the evidence At the time of the injury complained of the plaintiff was a boy not quite twelve years of age He was employed by the defendant company to work in its bagging room as a dofferthat is work on the spinning frames in taking off and putting on bobbinsand had been engaged in this and other employment for several weeks Adjacent to the bagging room was a large carding room in which fiftyone carding machines were operated These carding machines were located in rows with alleys between each row and a space seven feet eight inches wide around the entire room next to the walls It was necessamy for the employees in the bagging room to go through the carding room to reach the watercloset and the route usually taken for this purpose was around the walkway next to the walls On the occasion of the accident the plaintiff was pursuing this route on his way to the watercloset when he came upon several small boys hiis companions from the bagging room who were playing with the belt of one of the carding machines by throwing it off and on the revolving wheels The plaintiff had never engaged in suchi sport but it appealed to his childish instincts and he stopped and began to engage in the performance himself He had hardly begun to do so when his arm was caught between the belt and the pulley and so seriously injured that it had to be amputated above the elbow It is further shown that it was a common thing for the boys about the mill to play with the belts and that this fact was known to those in charge of the machinery and other departments50 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER May It is estabished by the testimony of the plaintiff which under the demurrer to the evidence must be taken as true that he had fre quently seen boys play with the belts as on this occasion that he did not know it was dangerous and that he had never at any time been warned against doing so or received instruction of any sort with respect to the dangers surrounding him There must have been a peculiar fascination in throwing the belts off and on as these boys were doing for the superintendent of the mills testifies that he had seen grown men play with the belts The law presumes that an infant between seven and fourteen years of age cannot be guilty of contributory negligence and in an action by such infant the burden is on the defendant to overcome this presumption by proof of intelligence and capacity Roanoke v Shull 97 Va 419 34 S E 34 75 Am St Rep 791 The defendant made no effort to overcome this presumption Indeed as said by the learned judge of the Circuit Court so far as any conielusion as to the plaintiffs intelligence can be drawn from his testimony it is of an unfavorable character The single inquiry here is therefore was the defendant guilty of negligence in the discharge of its duty to this little boy The degree of care due by the master to an infant employee of tender years is much greater than is due to an adult That course of conduct which would be ordinary care when applied to persons of mature judgment and dircretion might be gross and even criminal negligence toward children of tender years The same discernment and foresight that older people and experienced persons habitually employ in discovering dangers cannot be reasonably expected of children of tender years and therefore the greater precaution should be taken where children are exposed to such dangers Under the head of Special Duties of Masters to Minors the duty of one who employs young persons is thus stated in section 219 of Shearman and Red field on Negligence by the learned authors of that valuable work It is the duty of one who employs youLng persons in his service to take notice of their apparent age and ability and to use ordinary care to protect them from risks which thev cannot properly appre ciate and to which they ought not to be exposed This is a dutv which cannot be delegated and any failure to perform it leaves the master subject to the same liability with respect to such risks as if the child were not a servant For this purpose the master1904 LYNCHBURG COTTON MILLS V STANLEY 51 must instruct such young servants in their work and warn them against the dangers to which it exposes them and he must put this warning in such plain language as to be sure that they understand and appreciate the danger For it is not enough that he should dlo his best to make children understand They must not be exposed to dangers which they do not fully understand in fact Bearing in mind the natural forgetfulness of youth he must renew this warn ing from time to time as may be reasonably necessary And if the servant has not capacity enough to understand the warning and appreciate the danger or for any other reason does not in fact understand it the master will be liable for any injurv which such servant may suffer in consequence if continued at such work But the master is not required to point out dangers which are known or must be obvious to and fully appreciated by the servant after making due allowance for his youth Generally this question is for the jury In Thompson on Neg 978 it is said The law puts upon a master when he takes an infant into his service the duty of explain ing to him fully the hazards and dangers connected with the busi ness and of instructing him how to avoid them Nor is this all The master will not have discharged his duty in this regard unless the instructions and precautions given are so graduated to the youth ignorance and inexperience of the servant as to make him fully aware of the danger to him and to place him with reference to it in substantially the same state as if he were an adult In Bailey on Per Inj section 2766 it is said Persons who employ children to work with dangerous machineryT or in dangerous places should anticipate that they will exercise only such judgmnent discretion and care as is usual among children of the same age under similar circumstances and are bound to use due care having regard to their age and inexperience to protect them from dangers incident to the situation in which they are placed and as a reason able precaution in the exercise of such care in that behalf it is the duty of the employer to so instruct such employees concerning the dangers connected with their employment which dangers from their youth and inexperience they may not comprehend or appre ciate that they may by the exercise of such care as ought reason ably to be expected of them guard against and avoid injuries arising therefrom And further adds that an infant who by52 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER May reason of his youth and inexperience is injured when not prop erly intructed and warned as to the dangers incident to his work may recover therefor in Watson on Per Inj section 114 it is said The defendant will be liable if negligent though it is the act of the child injured which is proximate to his own injuries if such act is of a character niaturally to be expected of a child and in accordance with the usual indiscretions and errors of judgment characteristic of imma ture years The statement of the law by these authors of acknowledged accu racy and ability is sustained by numerous decisions of the courts of last resort throughout the country Sullivan v India Mfg Co 113 Mass 399 Rock v Orchard Mills 142

385 The rule established by the authorities cited is both just and humane Children of tender years are often employed about fac tories filled with complicated and dangerous machinery where they will be exposed to revolving wheels belts and pulleys where any one may know that by reason of inexperience and immature judg ment they are liable to be killed or maimed In the case under consideration there are as shown by the record employed in the mills of the defendant company seventyfive children under four teen years of age of which number fortyfive are under the age of twelve years If it is to the interest of manufacturing establish ments to employ infants of such tender years with their immature judgment and lack of experience not only the dictates of humanity but public policy demands that they should be held to the highest degree of responsibility for their care and protection They must take knowledge of their childish disposition to play and to plav1904 LYNCHBURG COTTON MILLS V STANLEY 53 with fire and of their inability to recognize danger although open and obvious to those of riper years They must instruct them as to the many dangers with which they are surrounded and the way to avoid such dangers and they must continue to repeat such instruction until they know the danger is fully understood and appreciated And in view of the proneness of children to forget they must from time to time renew these instructions warnings and cautions Of the existence of the rule requiring these duties of the master and of its preeminent justice there can be no doubt and we are of opinion that the case at bar is clearly within its influence The plaintiff was an ignorant child less than twelve years of age withouLt father mother or legal guardian In these cotton mills he was surrounded by innumerable dangers He was put to work in a position where upon every call of nature he was compelled to pass through a large carding room filled with machinery with its countless revolving wheels and belts He was subjected to all these perils without instruction or warning from his employers with respect to such dangers or how to act in order to avoid them He was left to his own resources and imma ture judgment with the natural result that in ignorance of the danger he was guilty of an act which brought upon him a calamity that compels him to a maimed and comparatively helpless life Such want of care and watchfulness over the immaturity of tender years by the master renders him liable under the rule of duty that we have seen he must observe The third bill of exceptions is to the action of the court in giving an instruction which provided that the jury might in estimating the paintiffs damage take into consideration among other things his loss of time and any other elements of damage necessarily occa sioned by or growing out of said injury The plaintiff had neither a natural nor legal guardian who was entitled to his wages and so far as the record throws any light on the subject he was working for his living and receiving his own wages Under these circumstances his time was his own and he was entitled to compensation for its loss As to the second ground of objection the language expressly limits the recovery to the elements of damage necessarily occasioned by or growing out of the injury and there was no error in its use The second and first bills of exception are to the action of the54 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER May court in admitting certain evidence tending to establish negligence on the part of the defendant in not having fenced the machinerv off the objection being that the evidence was immaterial and the witnesses deposing on the subject not experts In the conclusion we have reached this evidence has played no part and therefore the defendant has suffered no prejudice by its introduction even if it was inadnmissible as to which we express no opinion For these reasons the judgment of the Circuit Court must be affirmed Affirmed

and ilndorsed the forgery after maturity to a third party to whom it was paid by the defendant in the belief that it was the genuine note T he originial note was indorsed after this payment to the plaintiff who now brings action Held that he took the note suibject to the equities against C andcl could not recover Leach v Ifinh 66 N WX Rep 768 Ia This case has no precedent The court seems wrong in regarding these facts as giving rise to an equity attaching to the note anid barring the plaintiffs right The issue anid collection of the forged iinstrument was an independent transaction in which the defenidant might well base a setoff as against C but this is not an equity to be available against an ininocent indorsee even after maturity CARRIERS  SLEEPING CAR COMPANY  LIABILITY FOR BAGGAGE  The plain tiff a passenaer in a Wagnier sleepinig car on her arrival at her destination ilntiusted lher hand baggage to the porter to carry to the waitinigroom which was about a hundred yards froiii

provides that no person shall be excused from testifying before the Interstate Commerce Commission oni the ground that his testimony may tend to criminate him  but that no person shall be prosecuted

provided that it should be lawful for the company to take certain fixed tolls T here was no reserved power to alter the charter Later the legislature passed an act fixing uniform rates for all turnpikes in the State which were less than those fixed in the companiys charter Heldc latter act valid Though the charter of a private corporation is a contract and is withlin the protection of the clause against impairing the obligations of contracts yet if the corporation has a public fulnc tion to perform it is not protected from legislative interferenice unless the State has clearly indicated in the charter a purpose not to interfere Winchester  L 7Zirntike Road Co v Croxton 34 S W Rep 5i8 Ky The case is very similar to but goes a step beyond Railroad Commission Cases I 16 U S 307 where a grant of a power to fix charges was held not to prevent the legis lature from establishing rates  power was granted only to fix reasonable charges and the legislature is the judge of reasonableness the legislature did not intend to surrel der its power to fix rates So in the prinicipal case it is a question of the construction of the contract whether the State meant by granting the right to charge certain fixed rates to barter away forever the power to provide reasonable rates The courts treat ment of the case is sound and the case is a good illustration of the rule that rights not expressly granted by the State are reserved CONSTITUTIONAi LAW VESTED RIGHTS UNDER A CHARTER Bill by a stock holder in the Great Northern Railway to restrain the company from carrying out a contract of consolidation with the Nortlhern Pacific Railway whereby one half of the capital stock of the latter was to be transferred to stockholders of the Great Northern and the Great Northern was to guarantee the payment of certain Northern Pacific bonds The two lines were parallel anid competing The charter given to the Great Northern in I856 reserved the right of amenidmienit  in any manner not destroying or irnpairing the vested rights of said corporation By an amendment in 865 the rail road was given general power to consolidate with other roads In T874 the legislature forbade consolidation with parallel or competinig linles anid subsequently to this act of I874 the contract in question was eintered into Held that so long as the power to con solidate remained unexecuted it was not a vested right beyond the scope of legislative control and thus the act of I874 did not impair the obligation of a contract Pearsall v Great Northernz Ry Co I6 Sup Ct Rep 705 The case involves a point niot covered bv previous authorities The doctrine of the court appears to be that a power in a charter to do certain thinigs which are ulnneces sary to the main object of the grant may be treated as a mere license and revoked by the legislature so long as the power remains uniexecuted The case itself calls for nothing more than a decision that such an unexecuted power does not constitute a vested right within the meaning of the amendment clause in the origilnal charter how ever the very next case in the reporter conitains a dictum to the effect that even where the charter contains nio clause of reservation the public nature of railway corporations is such as to subject them to this sort of legislative control Under its police power said the court in Louisaille  N y Co v ZeAtucky I6 Sup Ct Rep 715 the legisla ture  may deal with the charter of a railway corporation so far as is niecessary for the protection of the lives health and safety of its passengers or the ptublic or for the security of property or the conservation of the public interests provided of courseRECENT CASES 129 that no vested rights are thereby impaired  and under the doctrine of the principal case a power to consolidate while unexecuted is riot a vested right The decision seems in line with the tendency to limit the scope of the Dartmouth College Case and to give wider range to the socalled police power of the State legislatures CONTRACTS  COMPROMISE OF DOUBTFUL CLAIM  Held that a promise made in consideration of the release by the promisee of a doubtful claim against the promisor is valid though such claim was not in fact enforceable Deovale v Ackermana 37 N Y Supp 959 It has been held that the release of a doubtful claim is not sufficient consideration to support a promise where no valid claim actually existed in favor of the promisee Gunning v Royezl 59 Miss 45 Such a rule as this would apparently discourage com promise as each case would be decided in court the same after compromise as before A better doctrine is supported by the weight of authority both in England and the United States According to this miodern view the compromise of a doubtful claim is valid consideration if the promisee honestly believed that he had a good cause of action Cook v Wright i B  S S59 Zoebisch v Von Minden et al 120 N Y 406 Pollock on Contracts 2d Am ed 182 note e

afterwards turned out to be a useless certificate of registra tion is invalid for want of consideration MeCullumt v Edmonds I9 So Rep 501 Ala In the absence of all fraud and as a question of law this decision is contra to the weight of authority Whatever might have been the ruling in equitv the mere inade quacy of consideration so long as there was some consideration should not have been gone into by a court of law The plaintiff was not bounid to turn over the certificate and the mere fact that it was not so valuable as the defendant expected should have no bearing on the case Haigh v Brooks lo

accord with recent adjudications by the same court cited in the opinion does not represent the better law The court seems to put much stress on the generally accepted rule in Stofferv State 15 Ohio St 47 that when a person has been feloniously assailed and the felon has desisted from his attempt and taken to flight the right to pursue for private defence ceases as soon as in the reasonable belief of the assailed the danger has ceased to be immediate and impending There is no analogy between the cases In Stoffer v State the original feloniious attack had ceased completely A reopening of the assault was an entirely new offence which the deceased undertook at his own risk But in the principal case the facts seem to be totally dif ferent The trespass was one of a series of conltinluous acts which as was known to the defendant would in all probability lead up to the taking of life CRIMINAL LAWINTOXICATING LIQUORSALE BY SOCIAL CLUB  Held that the dispensing of liquors by a social club

should be reduced by proceeds obtainable from other employment during the time necessary to have completed the contract Held that where the breach is of a conltract to do a particular thing not necessarily involving personal services there is no duty to seek to mitigate damages for the benefit of the delinquent and if the plaintiff actually does ob tain employment the amount of damages is

commit the assault in question a witness was permitted to testify that Chandler had admitted that he had made the assault Held that it was error to admit this testimony Reavis v State 44 Pac Rep 62 Wyominig The testimony admitted was mere hearsay As the admission of Chandler it could have been used against him But the admission was not that of defenidant nior of one identified in interest with him and therefore it could not be used as an admission againist defendant A common interest for or against the existence or nonexistence of a particular fact is not an identity of interest in the technical sense of that word T hus in divorce proceedinigs the admissions of the defendant that she has committed adultery with the corespondent can be used against her but not against the co respondent Robinson v Robinzson I Sw  Tr 362 There is a seeming absurdity in admittinig or excluding certain testimoniy accordinig as one or another persons interest will be affectedI by proof of the fact admitted The explanation of this logical ab surdity seems to be that on grounds of public policy one is not heard to say that the jury may not take into conisideration what he apparently thought

directions for the approach of a car Cincinnati St Ry Co v Snell 43 N E Rep 207 Ohio While recognizing the rule apparently well established in Ohio that one who crosses the tracks of a steam railroad must in the absence of a reasonable excuse look and listen in order to avoid the imputation of negligence the majority of the court refuse to extend it to cases of electric street cars Even in the case of a steam railroad the better view would seem to be that failure to look and listen is properly only prima facie evidence of negligence and the defenidanit is entitled to have the extenuating circum stances weighed by the jury Stackus v RailrOad 79 N Y 464 Afortiori in the case of the street railway where the company does not owni the tracks anid where less agility should be required to

Manchester Fire Assurance Co I9 So Rep 540 Ala The case is regarded as law though apparently decided but once before Hender son v Ins Co IO Rob La I64 I Biddle on Insurance  442 It is interesting hov ever to note that the act of the agent is the same in the principal case as that which constitutes barratry in marine insurance And while it was always tlle custom to specify in marine policies that barratry was insured against see 2 Phillips on Mar Ins  9 IO65 it was eventually decided that in the absence of such a stipulatioll barratry was niot included among the perils covered by the policy Waters v Mer chants Ins Co iI Peters 213 and the wilful misconduct of servants causing loss of goods upon land has been considered barratry in one case under a marine policy Boehmn v Combe 2 Maule

majority of the court were clearlv right namely that a per sonal judgment on constructive service againist a nonresident is void even in the State where it is made The law has shaped itself into this proposition since the case of Pennoyer v Ne9 95 U 5 714 The doubtftil point in the case seems to be whether a decree as to custody of children may not be made against the husband when the chil dren have been taken out of the State simply to avoid the divorceproceecdinigs Leav ing aside the question however on which the majoritv and minority differed in this case as to whether custody of children is a status to be passed oni like marriage it132 HARVA RD LA W REVIEW would seem that unless the court has the children before it it has no right to make a decree for it is the childrens interests which must be primarily considered and this can onily be done when the infants are present and adequately represented See note to Flintt River Steamboat Co v FIoser 48 Am Dec 273 and Cooley on

husbanid is joined Vansandt v Weir i9 So Rep 424 Ala This case is undoubtedly correct YThdd v Pittsburgh Fort Waynte e Chicago R R I9 Ohio St 514 but there being no misrepresentations it is hard to see how any question of estoppel arose Generally speaking however where there is no question of tort a married womani cannot be deprived by estoppel of that which she can not deprive herself of by her own free will 2 Bishop on Married Women Chapter XXXVI In Angell on Highways 3d ed Chap III  156 the view that there may be dedica tion by estoppel in pais is repuidiated and it would seem with justice Because a man is estopped by his acts or representations from denying the existence of a way as to three or four persons it does not follow that he has dedicated this way to the public as a street PERSONS MARRIED WOMEN POWER TO BIND SEPARATE ESTATE A mar ried woman mortgaged her land as security for a loan to her husband She made lno representations at the time of the mortgage that the loan had any connection with her separate estate and the mortgagee knew in fact that the loan was for the husbands sole benefit A statute gave the married woman the right  to contract and be coln tracted with as to her separate property in the same manner as if she were unimarried Held this mortgage was unetnforceable becausenot conniiected in any way with the mar ried womans separate estate If she had

the life tenant on whose estate the remainider was expectant In his capacity of guardian apparently in ignorance of his owni life estate he attempted to conivey by deed a present fee to a third party

life estate the statute had run againist the plaiintiff Nelson v Davidson 43 N E Rep 361 111 The court lays some stress on the fact that the deed which gave color to the de fendants adverse possession purported to convey the plaintiffs estate but nothing would seem to turni on that If Brownl cannot be considered a party to the disseisill no cause of action accrued to the plaintiff and she caninot be barred If the other view is taketn and the plaintiffs estate is being infringed upon then this decision is a distinct rejection of the doctrine of disseisin by election laid down in Taylor d Atkyns

the collectiodn of wharfage by the lessor from a shipper who occasionally used the wharf during the remainder of the term did not operate as a surrender as suich user was not procured by the lessor Aberdeen Coal  Minin Co v City of Evansville 43 N E Rep 316 Ilmd The court does not dispute the existence of a surrender where the lessor creates a new tenanicy after abandonment by the lessee Thomas v Cook 2 B  Ald 19 is cited with approval But it is said the collectioni of wharfage from one who uses the wharf at his own instance merely does not operate to discharge the lessee from liability to pay rent It is to be noticed that the doctrine of Auer v Penna 99 Pa St 370 in which case thle landlord rerented the abandoned premises to mitigate the lessees damages andRECENT CASES 133 notified the lessee that he was not thereby discharged from liability was not invoked And it would seem that the collection of wharfage by the lessor after the abandon ment apparently on its own account was as inconsistent with its recognition of the continuance of the lessees term as the creation of a new tenancy would have been The correctness of the decision which depends upon the validity of this distinction seems at least doubtful PROPERTY MORTGAGES  MERGER  BONA FIDE PURCHASER  A mortgagee acquired the title to the mortgaged property and in the deed by which it was coniveyed to him it was stated that the title was passed  subject to a mortgage of three huindred dollars which grantee hereby assumes and agrees to pay Held that it was evidenit from this that the intention was to continue the existence of the mortgage lien and no merger ensued and that exhibiting the unrecorded dleed to intending purchasers of the property combinied with the fact that the records disclosed the encutmibrance con stituted sufficient notice to such parties of the intention indicated by the clause in the deed Mathiews et al vJones 66 N W Rep 622 Neb This case is apparently very near the line but may be supported It is a general rule of law that a merger takes place when a greater and a lesser estate meet in the same party but in equity whenever the legal title becomnes united with the equity of redemption there will be no merger if such is the intenition of the parties Even however where there is an expressed initention especially if it be vague or doubtful the courts will presume the intention to be in accordance with the real interest of the parties and will rule accordingly Jones on Mortgages  848 856 870 873 per Sir William Grant in Forbes v Afoflztt i8 Ves 384 The clause subject to a mortgage etc in the deed seems to indicate the intentioni of the parties in the lrincipal case that the titles should be kept separate and the fact that in Nebraska as in most of the States a mortgage is regarded as a lien and not as an estate in fee does not ap parently affect the rule as to merger T he court would seem to be right too in hold ing that the plaintiffs in obtaining the title to the lanid were not bona fide purchasers T hey certainily had such notice as required them to make further inquiry in regard to the whereabouts of the mortgage and notes and should have required the mortgagee to produce them before purchasitng Jones on Mortgages  872 See also Purdy v Huystigton1 42 N Y 334 PROPERTY  MORTGAGE  STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS  EFFECT OF REMOVAI A executes to B

mortgage is thereby discharged the decision seems sound But this view of a mortgage is qtlite exceptional A few of the Western States have adopted it sometimes owing to the peculiar language of the Statute of Limitations as in Iowa and sometinmes owiiig to their conceptioni of the nature of a mortgage which they hold does not convey an estate but simply creates a lien Regarded in this light the mortgage becomes a mere incidcent to the debt and when the remedy on the debt is taken away the mortgage also disappears Jones on Mortgages 5th ed  1203 1204 1207 discusses the quiestion fully

waive the defence of the statutory bar in consideration of the latters forbearalnce to sue for a cer tain time The creditor does forbear for the tinme requested and afterwards brilngs suit Held the debtor cannot set up the Statute of Limitations as a defence Bridges v Stephens 34 S W Rep 555 Mo Express statutes similar to the above requiring written evidence of a new promise to pay by a debtor in order to bind him have been adopted in many of the States Such provisions might at first seem to cover the facts of the present case and to ren der the oral agreement invalid But a distinction is tobe made between two differelnt kinds of promise First there are those which have nothing but the past consideration of an old debt to support them It was at these that the statute requiring writing was evidently aimed Promises of the other class have a new and valid consideratioll anld therefore form part of a complete conitract This was the case in Bridges v Stephens The consideration was the forbearance of the creditor and there was in all respects a perfect second contract whiclh might have been declared on in a separate actioll East India Co v Paul 7 Moo P C C 85 112 It was not for such an agreement that the statute was intended but only for a bare promise This seems to be the true ratio de cidendi in the case The theory of estoppel put forward by the court is hardly tenable for

defenldanit in the libel suit against the plaintiff the Statute of Limitations did not begin to run until the determiniationi of the former suit in favor of the defendant therein since otherwise two courts at once might be tryinig the same issues of fact Pardee J dissenitinig Mastersonz v Brown 72 Fed Rep 36 This is a most surprising case In the first place it runs counter to a rule well settled in the law of libel that words used in judicial proceedings relevant to the issue are absolutely privileged Odgers Slander and Libel 187 I9I T 7orrey v fYeld TO Vt 353 414 Lawson v Ificks 38 Ala 279 The courts decision on this point is based onl White v Nichols 3 How 266 but an examiniation of that case will show that the remarks relied oni are dicta the case having arisen on libellous matter in a petition to the Presidenit for the removal of an official Such an occasion is no doubt one of qualified privilege Odgers Slander and Libel 226 In the second place whether or not express malice is a good reply to a plea of the privilege of judicial proceedings the cause of actiotn is certainly complete at the publication It is submitted therefore that although a postponiement of the libel suit may be desirable it is at least an inartistic way of effecting it to say that the cause of action does not accrue until the earlier case comes to judgment TRUSTS  PURCHASER FOR VALUE  PREEXISTING DEBT  One Price having a claim against The Elmbank for salvage made a partial assignment of his claim to the extent of I500 to Cofran anid later anlother partial assignment of the claim to the amount of 3200 to Newmani The assignment to Newmani was to secure a lreexist ing debt no agreement was made that the assignment was taken as conditional pay menit or that the debtor should be given time The salvage having been paid into court Newman the seconld assignee was the first to give notice to the holder of the funid The fund was not sufficient to pay both Newman and Cofran in full Held thatRE VIE WS I35 Newman was not a purchaser for value and therefore his prior notice to the holder of the fund did not entitle him to priority The Elmbank 72 Fed Rep 6io It seems clear on principle that a creditor who takes a thing merely as security for a preexisting debt gives no value and surreniders no right against his debtor in ex change for the new security given and therefore that he is not a purchaser for value Thus one who takes personal property as security for a preexisting debt takes it sub ject to equities attached to it in the hands of the debtor Goodwin v Massachusetts Lotazn CO 152 Mass 189 I99 Savings Bank v Bates I20 U S 556 It is true that by the prevalent view one who takes niegotiable paper as security for a preexistilng debt takes it free of all equities Railroad Co v Bazk I02 U S 14 but it seems clear that the cases taking this view must be supported niot otn the ground that the holder is a purchaser for value but on the ground that he has taken negotiable paper  a thing which in many respects is treated as money  in the course of a business transaction and that he may therefore hold it free of all equities

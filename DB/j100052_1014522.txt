j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1014522,Curves of Expansion and Contraction 19191921,i242690,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY ture by the Federal Reserve Banks for office buildings and vaults for branches is necessary in order to con duct the work properly It is not improbable that in the future development and progress of the Federal Reserve System there will arise the necessity for the location of other branches to meet the demands or requirements of business com munities or industrial centers These situations will be met and provided for and any additional functions which may be properly assumed by the Federal Reserve Banks will likewise be allotted to the branches Curves of Expansion and Contraction 19191921 By A C MILLER Federal Reserve Board Washington D C THE economic vicissitudes through which the country has passed dur ing the past year have brought to everyone a vivid and memorable ex perience of the actualities of expansion and contraction and have made the study of the conditions which eventu ate in these violent alternations of the curves of business and credit a matter of profound practical importance War and its immediate aftermath of business inflations made the credit expansion Afterwar readjustment with its inevitable liquidation has made the credit contraction So much is already clear from the outside point of view and is now admitted by most fairminded people But what is fur ther revealed and how does the matter look when the operations of the bank ing system are viewed from the nearby or Federal Reserve point of view For this whole recent experience raises some questions of great moment with regard to the functioning of the coun trys new credit mechanism It is not the purpose of this discus sion to go into the economics of the expansion and contraction of 1919 1921 It is not at all concerned with questions of economic causation No attempt will be made to determine whether expansion or contraction of credit caused expansion or contraction of business and the rise and fall of prices or whether the movement of credit was determined by the move ments of business and prices The correlation of the business and finan cial factors involved in the economic developments of the past three years presents too complex a problem to be undertaken within the limits of this paper For the assistance of any who are ambitious to penetrate the eco nomic mysteries of recent expansion and contraction there is nevertheless appended to this article a collection of data covering most of the determi nable factors involved in the problem In order to make the fluctuations in the different items comparable they are expressed in the form of index numbers based on the 1919 average A second table shows the absolute figures upon which the index numbers of banking are based MEASUREMENT OF EXPANSION AND CONTRACTION The object of the present discussion is to ascertain what light recent ex perience throws on the question as to whether the Reserve System possesses a sensitive and accurate indicator of changes in the credit and business 142CURVES OF EXPANSION AND CONTRACTION14 cr00 0 o o

in general depends on four factors or in mathe matical language is a function of four variables 1 physical volume of pro duction 2 price level 3 activity of trade rapidity of turnover and 4 speculative and other transactions in securities exchange etc A change in any one of these factors affects the total volume of business and this in turn affects the total volume of credit re quired In any exhaustive analysis of the business or economic situation to ascertain what factors are affecting the demand for credit facilities or let us say the expansion or contraction of credit careful attention must always of course be given to variations in any of the elements affecting the volume of business CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS SITUATION 19191920 Beginning about midyear 1919 and extending to the end of the year there was a pronounced expansion of busi ness accompanied by great speculative activity involving commodities as well as securities Increased activity of business rapidity of turnover and rise of prices were the important factors in this development The index of the physical volume of production for manufactures shows no noteworthy change during this interval Economic reaction set in early in 1920 and continued throughout the 2 As measured by debits to individual accounts in banks in about 150 leading clearinghouse centers In order to eliminate shorttime fluctuations due to the difference in the number of business days in a month to midmonth and end of the month payments and to Treasury operations in connection with the quarterly in stallment of income taxes the volume of business curve on the chart has been smoothed by means of a moving average which shows for each month the average volume of business for the month and the two preceding months year Business recession was much in evidence and gained in momentum after midsummer 1920 In the first quarter of 1921 the reaction reached the stage of acute liquidation There after business pursued a steadier course This period of reaction and liquidation was marked by dimin ished physical volume of production for manufactures after midsummer 1920 and by the drop of wholesale prices The index for manufactures declined from 1023 in July to 779 in December 1920 and to 685 in July 1921 The price index declined from 1236 in July to 892 in December 1920 and 698 in July 1921 These changes in the business situation 1919 1921that is the rise and the fall in the volume of business transactions are clearly reflected in the curve of business Its trends are unmistakable How well are these changes in the business situationin brief the ex pansion and contraction of the volume of businessreflected in the curves of credit first that of the member banks and second that of the Federal Re serve Banks MEMBER BANK CREDIT CURVE OF EXPANSION AND CONTRACTION The member bank credit curve re flects pretty faithfully the business ex pansion which went on in the second half of the year 1919 and again the liquidation which was in process in the early part of the year 1921 It will be noticed that the liquidation of the loan account of the reporting member banks in the first six months of the year 1921 approximately cancels the expansion of the loan account of these banks in the second six months of the year 1919 Through the year 1920 however it will be noticed that the curve of credit of the member banks shows a different trend from the curve of business The business recession which was in process 144CURVES OF EXPANSION AND CONTRACTION in 1920 is not at all reflected in the member bank curve of credit There was no contraction of credit until the last quarter of the year On the con trary the banks were expanding their accommodation throughout the year and until after the cropmoving season was over Agriculture was in distress while business was in the midst of the crisis of readjustment and needed as sistance in effecting the transition from the period of expansion through the period of liquidation That assistance was being extended by the banks as both of the curves of credit clearly indicate and thus was liquidation of business moderated and kept orderly by comparison with what it would have been had it not been for the steadying and easing influence of our new credit machinery THE RESERVE BANK CURVE OF CREDIT Turning to the Reserve Bank curve of credit it appears that the curve of credit of the Federal Reserve Banks parallels the curve of business more closely than does the curve of credit of the member banks both in the period of rapid expansion in 1919 and in the period of acute liquidation in 1921 It will be noticed on the chart that the Reserve Bank curve of credit in the period under review twice cuts through the member bank curve of credit once in October 1919 on the upward swing of business and again in April 1921 on the downward swing of busi ness By comparison with the mem ber bank curve the ascent of the Re serve Bank curve was more pronounced on the rise as was also its descent on the fall On the other hand through out nearly the whole of 1920 when the business curve was showing a decided downward trend until the last quarter when a slight rise is shown due to sea sonal influences the Reserve Bank curve of credit showed an opposite or 11 upward trend Both curves of credit in the critical year 1920 therefore followed a different trend from the curve of business but it is noteworthy that the difference is much more pro nounced in the Reserve Banks curve than in the member banks curve THE GOLD INFLUX AND RESERVE BANK CREDIT CURVE There still remains to be considered the curve of gold reserves The sharp and prolonged drop in the Reserve Bank curve of credit through the year 1921 and the liquidation which it re flects cannot be understood without reference to the great influx of gold into the country and into the Federal Reserve Banks which has been in process during the past twelve months Reference to the chart brings out the opposite movements in these two sig nificant and related curves Reference to the index numbers shows that the index of the Federal Reserve Systems gold holdings rose from 94 in October 1920 to 130 in October 1921 while the index of bill holdings declined from 137 in October 1920 to 63 in October 1921 Over 45 per cent of the liquida tion of the loan account of the Federal Reserve System it appears may be at tributed to the increase of its gold hold ings The influence to be attributed to the gold factor in Federal Reserve Bank liquidation is still greater in the case of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York which has been the chief recipient of the gold flowing from Europe to our shores The index of bill holdings for that bank fell from 126 in October 1920 to 37 in October 1921 Its gold index for the same period shows a rise from 74 to 156 The gold factor is thus seen to account for over 73 per cent of the liquidation experienced by the loan account of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York The great stream of gold which has 145THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY poured into the United States from Europe during the past year has come in liquidation of foreign indebtedness to us and has been turned over by member banks to the Federal Reserve Banks in liquidation of their own in debtedness The pronounced and con tinuous downward trend of the Re serve Bank loan curve during the past year is therefore seen to be due largely to foreign liquidation The course of business shows considerable steadiness after the first quarter of 1921 and the member bank curve of credit after the second quarter but the Reserve Bank curve of credit continues its downward course in 1921 without abatement in quick and close response to the con tinuously upward course of the curve of gold reserves As an indicator of the degree and rapidity of domestic liqui dation the Reserve Bank curve of credit is misleading owing to the dis turbing influence of the gold factor THE RESERVE BANK CURVE OF CREDIT THE MORE SENSITIVE INDICATOR OF CREDIT CHANGE Comparing the two curves of credit with one another it is clear that while both curves are influenced by the same changes in the business situation their response is not the same A glance at the chart brings out the fact that the Reserve Bank curve moves very much more readily and markedly than the member bank curve The member bank curve appears flat by comparison with the Reserve Bank curve and gives a less lively impression of the business and credit developments and changes which were in process What is the explanation of the difference and which of the two curves is the better index of expansion and contraction The relative flatness of the member bank credit curve during the year 1920 as compared with the Reserve Bank curve is due to several circumstances some transitory in character It will be recalled that the loan and invest ment account of the banks of the coun try was greatly swollen during the War by heavy investments in Liberty bonds and Certificates of Indebtedness and by accomodation granted subscribers to government war loan issues After the War the process was reversed There has been constant liquidation of bank holdings of government securities and of loans collateraled by such securi ties Reporting member banks hold ings of government securities dropped from 3083 millions in May 1919 to 1938 millions in January 1920 and 1318 millions in January 1921 Fig ures of holdings of paper secured by government securities are not available until December 1919 when they amounted to 1337 millions From this point they declined to 899 millions in December 1920 and 577 millions in October 1921 The liquidation in the loan and investment account of the member banks from these sources has therefore been very considerable But it does not appear to be reflected in the movement of the member bank curve of credit in 1920 That curve was ascending in spite of liquidation from these sources But had it not been for this liquidation it is altogether reason able to assume that it would have ascended still more The credit thus released byliquidation of war loan secu rities and paper was apparently being used to expand the commercial and speculative loan accounts of the banks3 Something similar occurred in the early autumn of 1919 when it will be noticed the member bank curve was rising while the Re serve curve was declining the banking expansion then in process being able to proceed without increased borrowings from Federal Reserve Banks This is explained by the fact that the floating debt of the government was reduced at this time by almost 500 millions of dollars the banks using the funds thus made available to them for the expansion of their commercial loans 146CURVES OF EXPANSION AND CONTRACTION When we come to the period of liquidation in the autumn of 1920 and the following winter there appeared an influence of an opposite character to that just describednamely the so called frozen credit By frozen credit is meant credit that has con tinued its existence beyond the time when the transactions which gave rise to the credit should normally have liquidated themselves It is made up of credits which have not been liqui dated because the transactions under lying the credits have not been able to run their course and liquidate them selves It is well known that large volumes of goods produced last year have been carried by the producers for lack of satisfactory markets Prices were falling markets were collapsing and there was congestion of goods at points of primary production and dis tribution The owners of these goods had to be carried There is no means of approximating the amount of these frozen credits but there is reason to believe that they constitute a very substantial fraction of the total loans and discounts carried by the commer cial banks of the country The member bank loan curve shows resistance to the forces of liquidation It was this retarded or orderly liqui dation which kept the curve from de scending as swiftly as it otherwise would have if it had been influenced merely by the volume of current busi ness transactions Moreover the li quidating power of a dollar paid in by a member bank to its Reserve Bank in a period of liquidation appears on the basis of the past two years to be very much less than the creditsupporting power of a dollar loaned by a Federal Reserve Bank to a member bank in a period of active expansion4 And fur During the period of expansion between 1919 and 1920 dates for which information is avail able being June 27 1919 June 25 1920 and June thermore the Federal Reserve Bank loan curve as has already been pointed out represents in a peculiar degree the liquidating effect on the Federal Re serve loan account of the huge influx of gold which has been continuous during the past twelve months Besides these transitory influences which have helped to give the member bank loan curve a relatively flat character there is the additional important and regular in fluence exercised by the far greater volume of member bank loans com pared with Reserve Bank loans Ow ing to the fact that the base figure is much larger for member banks than for Reserve Banks the same change in absolute amounts will result in a much larger percentage change and con sequently in a much steeper movement in a Reserve Bank curve than in a mem ber bank curve But this arithmetical fact does not fully explain the discrep ancy There is a further reason of an economic character to be noted in a study of the curves of expansion and contraction The great bulk of the loans of the member banks at any time represents loans incident to the ordinary volume and requirements of business and 29 1921 the increase in the loans of the member banks was 67 times as great as the increase in the discounts of the Federal Reserve Banks while during the following year the decrease in the loans was only 23 times as large as the decrease in Federal Reserve Bank discounts For the reporting member banks for which data on more significant dates are available July 25 1919 before the speculative expansion began October 15 1920 when the peak was reached and November 2 1921 the latest date for which data are available their investment and loan account increased 32 times as fast during the period of expansion as their borrowings from the Federal Reserve Banks while during the period of liquidation the reduction in the investment and loan account of the reporting member banks is 16 times as large as the corresponding reduc tion in their borrowings from Federal Reserve Banks 147THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY exercises even in times of marked changes in the business situation a steadying influence on the member bank credit curve The situation of the Reserve Banks is different Their loan account does not reflect the normal volume of credit in use Under normal conditions their operations are not large It is not the absolute amount of credit in use but the ebb and flow of credit which affects the loan account of the Federal Reserve Bank The Federal Reserve Bank has little part in the ordinary credit business of the country It does not deal with busi ness borrowers directly The relations of the business man are with his mem ber bank the member bank in turn dealing with the Reserve Bank as oc casion may necessitate The Federal Reserve loan is not the first line of credit but the second line of credit The expansion and contraction of the Reserve Bank loan account are twice removed from the expansion and contraction of the volume of busi ness as reflected in commercial bank loans The Federal Reserve is called into activity when the supply of ordinary credit facilities is inadequate It sup plements the resources of its members It is so to speak the increments and decrements in the countrys credit re quirements that are reflected in the up ward and downward movement of the Federal Reserve loan account It is when business is speeding up beyond their normal credit capacity that the commercial banks must resort to the Federal Reserve Banks for accommo dation When business is receding and liquidating in a period of economic reaction slackening of credit require ments will result in a marked reduction of borrowings from Federal Reserve Banks The Reserve Bank curve con sequently reflects movement change the more or less of credit required and not the actual total volume of credit in use by business On a rela tive basis the Reserve Bank curve has a tendency to magnify what is in proc ess in times either of rapid expansion or of acute liquidation in other words to give an exaggerated or heightened impression of these movements A GUIDE TO CREDIT POLICY Therein consists its importance as an administrative guide While it may be faulty as a gauge of the degree of credit expansion or contraction its very sensitiveness gives it a peculiar value as a quick indicator of what changes in the business and credit situation are in process or even im pending For while the Reserve Bank curve during the period under review has been over sensitive and gives an exaggerated impression of credit de velopments the member bank curve for reasons already discussed and primarily because at any moment it is more influenced by what has taken place than by what is taking place tends to give an inadequate impression of changes which are in process at least so far as they affect the credit situation In times of rapid expansion or contrac tion it is not the total volume of out standingbank loans which is significant but additions to that volume or reduc tions in it From this point of view the Reserve Bank curve is a truer in dex of business and credit development than the member bank curve and a better guide to credit policy 148CURVES OF EXPANSION AND CONTRACTION INDEX NUMBERS OF BANKING AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS 19191921

J101009,THE VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER,1098834,THE WEATHERHOLTZ CASE,I245832,1897 CORRESPONDENCE 787 CORRESPONDENCE THE WTATHERHOLTZ CASE EDITOR OF THE REGISTER THE STATEMENT OF THIS CASE IN THE REGISTER OF JANUARY 1897 SHOWS THAT THE JURY IN THIS CASE AS JURIES FREQUENTLY DO RESOLVED ITSELF INTO A LEGISLATIVE BODY OR BOARD OF PARDON INSTEAD OF EXERCISING ITS LEGAL FUNCTION AND REGARDING ITS SWORN DUTY TO ASCERTAIN A FACT BUT WAS THE ACTION OF THE COURT IN SETTING ASIDE THE VERDICT AND AWARDING A NEW TRIAL OF ITS OWN MOTION WARRANTED IN LAW IF WEATHERHOLTZ WAS IN FACT INDICTED FOR ONE CRIME AND FOUND GUILTY OF ANOTHER NOT EMBRACED IN THE ONE CHARGED IN THE INDICTMENT AND ONE OF WHICH THE JURY COULD UNDER NO STATE OF FACTS HAVE FOUND HIM GUILTY THEN THE COURT WAS RIGHT IN SETTING THE VERDICT ASIDE BECAUSE IT WAS A VOID VERDICT AND ONE UPON WHICH NO JUDGMENT COULD BE RENDERED BUT THIS WAS NOT THE FACT AND THE COURT MAKES A VERY ERRONEOUS THOUGH APPARENTLY PLAUSIBLE ARGUMENT WHEN IT UNDERTAKES TO SHOW IT TO BE THE FACT IT SEEMS TO BE CONCEDED BY THE COURT THAT THE EVIDENCE IN THE CASE SHOWED THAT WEATHERHOLTZ WAS GUILTY OF THE HOMICIDE IT SEEMS THEN THAT THE ACTION OF THE COURT IN SETTING ASIDE THE VERDICT AND AWARDING A NEW TRIAL OF ITS OWN MOTION RESULTED FROM A FAILURE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN DIFFERENT SPECIES OF CRIME AND DIF FERENT GRADES OF THE SAME CRIME ALL MURDER IS INCLUDED IN THE GENERAL TERM HOMICIDE THE KILLING WITH MALICE AFORETHOUGHT OF A REASONABLE CREATURE IN BEING IN THE PEACE OF THE STATE IS MURDER OUR LEGISLATURE WITH A VIEW TO MITI GATE IN SOME CASES THE PUNISHMENT INFLICTED BY THE COMMON LAW IN THE CASE OF MURDER HAS MADE TWO DEGREES OF THE CRIME THE FIRST OF WHICH ONLY IS PUNISHABLE WITH DEATH CODE SEES 3662 3663 OUR COURTS HAVE DECLARED THE PRESUMPTION TO BE THAT ALL HOMICIDE IS MURDER OF THE SECOND DEGREE AND PLACED UPON THE COMMONWEALTH THE BURDEN OF SHOWING THAT THE OFFENCE IS MURDER OF THE FIRST DEGREE AND UPON THE ACCUSED THE BURDEN OF REDUCING THE OFFENCE FROM MURDER OF THE SECOND DEGREE THE LEGISLATURE HAS IN EFFECT SAID THAT THE PROOF OF CERTAIN FACTS IN THE CASE AS THAT THE HOMICIDE WAS COMMITTED BY MEANS OF POISON STARVING LYING IN WAIT C OR IN THE ATTEMPT TO COMMIT CERTAIN CRIMES SHALL DISPENSE WITH FURTHER PROOF OF MALICE AND DELIBERA TION ON THE PART OF THE ACCUSED AND MAKE ALL HOMICIDES SO COMMITTED MURDER OF THE FIRST DEGREE HILLS CASE 2 GRATT 595 WILLIS V COMMONWEALTH 32 GRATT 929 CODE SEC 3662 THE JURY IN THIS CASE IN FINDING THE ACCUSED GUILTY OF MURDER OF THE SECOND DEGREE DID NOT FIND HIM GUILTY OF A DISTINCT OFFENCE FROM THAT CHARGED IN THE IN DICTMENT OR OF WHICH THE PROOF SHOWED HIM GUILTY AS STATED BY THE PRESIDING JUDGE BUT OF A LOWER DEGREE OF THE SAME OFFENCE THEY UNDOUBTEDLY FOUND HIM GUILTY OF THE HOMICIDE A FORTIORI WHEN THE INDICTMENT AS APPEARS DID NOT CHARGE THAT THE HOMICIDE WAS COMMITTED BY LYING IN WAIT BUT EVEN HAD THE INDICTMENT CHARGED MURDER BY LYING IN WAIT IT WOULD NOT ALTER THE SITUATION THE JURY HAD THE RIGHT5 AND IT WAS ITS DUTY UNDER THE LAW TO FIND THE ACCUSEDVIRGINIA LAW REGISTER GUILTY OF MURDER OF THE SECOND DEGREE UNLESS THE COMMONWEALTH HAD SHOWN THE OFFENCE TO HAVE BEEN MURDER OF THE FIRST DEGREE AND IT HAD THE POWER UNDER THE LAW TO FIND HIM GUILTY OF MURDER OF THE SECOND DEGREE EVEN THOUGH THE PROOF SHOWED MURDER OF THE FIRST DEGREE BECAUSE THE RIGHT AND DUTY TO FIX THE DEGREE OF THE HOMICIDE WHEN GUILT IS ESTABLISHED IS CONFERRED UPON THEM BY LAW CODE SEC 4041 BUT SUPPOSE THE COMMONWEALTH HAD MADE OUT BY INDISPUTABLE PROOF A CASE OF MURDER OF THE FIRST DEGREE AND THE JURY IN VIOLATION OF ITS DUTY TO RENDER A TRUE VERDICT FAILED TO SO FIND WAS IT THE DUTY OF THE COURT OF ITS OWN MOTION AND FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE PRISONER TO IN EFFECT ACQUIT HIM ALTOGETHER OF THE OF FENCE CHARGED HAS THE COURT THE RIGHT EVEN ON THE MOTION OF THE PRISONER TO SET ASIDE THE ACTION OF THE JURY FOR ERROR WHICH IS CLEARLY AND INDISPUTABLY IN HIS FAVOR THE COMMONWEALTH IS THE PARTY PREJUDICED BUT IT CANNOT COMPLAIN IT MIGHT BE SUGGESTED WITH REASON THAT THE JURY IN THIS CASE IN FIXING THE DEGREE OF HOMICIDE AT MURDER OF THE SECOND DEGREE WERE ACTUATED BY A DESIRE TO PROTECT THE PRISONER AND TO MITIGATE HIS PUNISHMENT IT IS PROPER TO OBSERVE THAT THE COURT IS NOT THE TRIER OF THE FACTS IN A CRIMINAL CASE THIS IS PECULIARLY THE PROVINCE OF THE JURY NEITHER IS IT THE PROVINCE OF THE COURT IN THIS STATE TO DETERMINE THE DEGREE OF THE HOMICIDE OF WHICH THE ACCUSED IS FOUND GUILTY EXCEPT IN CASE OF HIS CONFESSION CODE SEC 4041 IN THIS RESPECT THE COURTS DUTY REQUIRES IT TO GO ONLY SO FAR AS TO INSTRUCT THE JURY AS TO THE LAW OF THE CASE AND AS TO WHAT FACTS ARE NECESSARY TO CONSTITUTE THE DIFFERENT GRADES OF THE CRIME IT IS A FACT FAMILIAR TO LAWYERS THAT IN THE EARLY HISTORY OF JURY TRIALS JURIES WERE SELECTED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR OWN KNOWLEDGE OF THE FACTS WHICH THEY WERE TO TRY THEIR FINDING IS ONE OF FACT WHICH THE COURTS HAVE NEVER DISTURBED AND WHICH THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO DISTURB UNLESS IT IS SUCH THAT UNDER THE PLEADINGS NO JUDGMENT CAN BE RENDERED UPON IT OR IS MANIFESTLY UNSUPPORTED BY THE EVIDENCE AND IS TO THE PREJUDICE OF THE ACCUSED THE EVIDENCE IN CASES OF MURDER IS NOT A MATTER OF RECORD AT ALL UNLESS SO MADE BY BILL OF EXCEPTIONS TENDERED ON BEHALF OF THE PRISONER HERE WE THEN HAVE A PERSON INDICTED FOR MURDER BY AN INDICTMENT UNDER WHICH HE MAY BE CONVICTED OF MURDER OF THE FIRST OR SECOND DEGREE OR OF A LESS OFFENCE AS THE PROOF MAY SHOW HE IS FOUND BY THE JURY GUILTY OF MURDER OF THE SECOND DEGREE AND THE COURT OF ITS OWN MOTION SETS THE VERDICT ASIDE AND AWARDS A NEW TRIAL BECAUSE IT IS SATISFIED THAT THE PROOF SHOWED HIM GUILTY OF THE FIRST DEGREE OF THE HOMICIDE IT THEN ON THE CASE COMING ON TO BE TRIED THE SECOND TIME DISCHARGES THE ACCUSED BECAUSE THE WHOLE PROOF TO BE INTRODUCED IN THE CASE MUST SHOW HIM GUILTY OF MURDER OF THE FIRST DEGREE OF WHICH CRIME HE HAS ALREADY BEEN ACQUITTED AND FOR WHICH HE CANNOT BE AGAIN TRIED COMMENT WOULD SEEM UNNECESSARY TO SHOW THE ERROR IN SUCH ACTION THE COURT IS RIGHT IN SAYING THAT IT IS ITS DUTY TO PROTECT THE ACCUSED BUT IT IS NOT QUITE CLEAR HOW THIS DUTY WAS CALLED INTO ACTION IN THIS CASE CAN IT BE SAID THAT IF THE ACCUSED WAS UNDER THE PROOF IN THE CASE GUILTY OF MURDER OF THE FIRST DEGREE HE HAD THE RIGHT TO HANG OR GO ACQUIT OF THE OFFENCE THIS IS THE RESULT OF THE ACTION OF THE COURT WHEN THE CASE WAS CALLED FOR SECOND TRIAL WHICH LOGICALLY FOLLOWED THAT TAKEN ON THE FIRST TRIAL IF THE ACTION OF THE COURT IN THIS CASE IS PROPER THEN A PARTY WHO IS INDICTED FOR MURDER AND FOUND GUILTY OF MANSLAUGHTER BUT WHOM THE PRESIDING JUDGE THINKS HAS BEEN PROVEN GUILTY OF MURDER OF THE FIRST OR SECOND DEGREE MUST GO FEB 788FOREVER ACQUIT OF ALL CRIME AND SO ON IN ALL CASES OF CRIME DIVIDED INTO DEGREES AD INFINITUM AD ABSURDUM THE JURY IS BY OUR STATUTE CODE SEC 4041 INVESTED WITH THE POWER TO FIX THE DEGREE OF MURDER OF WHICH THE ACCUSED IS GUILTY IF THEY FIND HIM GUILTY OF MURDER AND IT IS THEIR DUTY TO SO FIX THE DEGREE OF THE CRIME A VERDICT OF A JURY FINDING THE ACCUSED GUILTY OF MURDER WITHOUT FIXING THE DEGREE WOULD UNDER OUR STATUTE BE BAD AND NO JUDGMENT COULD BE RENDERED UPON IT BUT WE ARE NOT WITHOUT AUTHORITY UPON THE VERY QUESTION INVOLVED IN THE CASE UNDER DISCUSSION IN THE CASE OF THE STATE V LINDSEY 19 NEVADA 47 S C 3 AM ST REP 776 THE APPELLANT WAS INDICTED FOR THE CRIME OF MURDER ALLEGED TO HAVE BEEN COMMITTED BY THE ADMINISTERING OF POISON AND THE JURY FOUND HER GUILTY OF MURDER OF THE SECOND DEGREE IT WAS CONTENDED ON THE PART OF THE ACCUSED THAT THE VERDICT WAS A VERDICT OF ACQUITTAL BECAUSE THE CRIME ALLEGED IN THE INDICTMENT WAS MURDER OF THE FIRST DEGREE AND THAT THERE WAS NO SUCH CRIME UNDER THE STATUTE OF NEVADA AS MURDER OF THE SECOND DEGREE FOR A HOMICIDE COMMITTED BY MEANS OF POISON THE STATUTE OF NEVADA UNDER WHICH THIS CASE WAS TRIED WAS ALMOST IDENTI CAL WITH OUR OWN STATUTE IN FIXING THE TWO DEGREES OF MURDER AND IN DIRECTING THAT THE JURY IN FINDING THE ACCUSED GUILTY OF MURDER SHOULD IN THEIR VERDICT DESIG NATE THE DEGREE OF THE HOMICIDE WHETHER MURDER OF THE FIRST OR SECOND DEGREE IT WAS HELD BY THE COURT THAT THE JURY COULD FIND THE PRISONER GUILTY OF MURDER OF THE SECOND DEGREE FOR A HOMICIDE COMMITTED BY MEANS OF POISON FOR THE REASON THAT THE QUESTION OF DEGREE WAS TO BE SETTLED BY THEM UNDER THE STATUTE OF NEVADA THAT THEY HAD THE POWER TO FIX THE CRIME OF MURDER OF THE SECOND DEGREE WHEN IT OUGHT UNDER THE LAW AND THE FACTS TO BE FIXED AT MURDER OF THE FIRST DEGREE AND THAT THOUGH THE JURY SHOULD ERR IN FIXING THE CRIME AT MURDER OF THE SECOND DE GREE WHEN IT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN FIXED AT MURDER OF THE FIRST DEGREE IT WAS ERROR IN FAVOR OF THE PRISONER OF WHICH THE LAW WOULD TAKE NO COGNIZANCE THE COURT SUS TAINS ITS CONCLUSIONS BY A WELLCONSIDERED OPINION IN WHICH VARIOUS AUTHORITIES ARE CITED AMONG WHICH IS THE CASE OF LANE V COMMONWEALTH 59 PA ST 375 FROM WHICH THE COURT QUOTES AS FOLLOWS  IT HAS NEVER BEEN DECIDED IN PENNSYLVANIA THAT A VERDICT OF MURDER IN THE SECOND DEGREE MIGHT NOT BE GIVEN IN A CASE OF MURDER BY POISON THAT IT MAY BE GIVEN IS AS UNQUESTIONABLE AS THE POWER OF THE JURY IS UNDER THE ACT TO GIVE IT AND IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE COURT TO REFUSE IT DOUBTLESS THE COURT IN THIS CASE WAS ENTIRELY SINCERE IN ITS ACTION BUT IT IS RE SPECTFULLY SUBMITTED THAT ITS COURSE IS SUPPORTED BY NEITHER REASON NOR LAW AND IS FRAUGHT WITH MOST SERIOUS DANGER TO THE COMMONWEALTH W B KEGLEY WYTHEILLE VA A NEW DEFINITION OF A DEMURRER TO EVIDENCE EDITORS VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER THE COURT OF APPEALS IN VIRGINIA HAS ITERATED AND REITERATED THE ANCIENT SCOPE AND DEFINITION OF A DEMURRER TO EVIDENCE BETWEEN TWENTY AND THIRTY TIMES AND IT MAY NOW BE PRESUMED THAT THE DEFINITION WHICH HAS SO OFTEN BEEN GIVEN IN IDENTICALLY THE SAME TERMS IS UNDERSTOOD BY THE BAR AND THAT THEY HAVE LEARNED BY MANY EXAMPLES HOW MUCH THE DEMURRANT YIELDS TO THE DEMURREE HOW ABSO LUTELY THE COURTS SURRENDER THEIR CREDULITY UNDER THE SPELL OF THIS FORM OF DEFENCE 1897 789 CORRESPONDENCE

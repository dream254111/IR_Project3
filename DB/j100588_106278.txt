Experiments on Water obtained from the melted Ice of SeaWater to ascertain whether it be fresh or not and to determine its specific Gravity with respect to other Water Also experiments to find the Degree of Cold in which SeaWater begins to freeze By Mr Edward Nairne Addressed to Sir John Pringle Bart P R S TO SIR JOHN PRINGLE BART P R S Hampstead S I R Feb 1 1776 IT having been suggested in a conversation at which I was present that the ice of seawater is not fresh and that if the ice found near the poles be really so it must probably be the ice of fresh water dis charged into the sea from large rivers in those parts I thought the present cold weather afforded an opportunity too favourable to be lost of ascertaining by experiment whether the water obtained from the melted ice of sea water be free from the taste of salt or not of comparing its gravity with that of the seawater c and of find ing the degree of cold in which the latter begins to freeze and I beg leave to lay before  an account of my researches in these matters and of the methods I fol lowed in making them If you SIR should think them worthy of notice and would communicate them to the learned body over which you preside you would confer an honour on c VOL LXVI K k THE R Feb 1 1776250 Mr NAIRNE on Ice of Sea Water THE seawater used in the following experiments was furnished by Mr OWEN who keeps the Mineral Water Warehouse at Temple Bar who assured me that it was taken up off the North Foreland On the 27th of January 1766 at ten oclock in the evening I filled a jar 314 inches in diameter and 612 inches deep with seawater and exposed it to the open air the thermometer standing at 15 At noon the next day on taking it in I found it frozen very hard except a very little at the bottom which remained quite fluid I now set it by a stove in a heat of 56 to thaw The ice when taken in from the open air was one quarter of an inch above the edge of the jar When the jar had continued in the degree of heat abovementioned during eight hours I took out the ice which was then 312 inches long and two inches in diameter about twothirds of the water appeared to remain In order to clear the ice from any brine that might adhere to it I washed it in a pail of pump water in which it was suffered to remain about a quarter of an hour and then set it in a fieve to drain off the water in which it had been washed On the 29th of January 1776 I set the beforemen tioned ice in a basin in a heat of about 46 in which it continued nine hours before the whole was dissolved The bulb of a thermometer rested on the ice during the time of the solution and continued without variation at 32 The water thus obtained was to my palate per fectly free from any taste of salt InMr NAIRNE on Ice of Sea Water 251 In order to ascertain the comparative gravity of this water I filled a bottle with it to a certain mark in its neck which was very narrow and weighed the bottle so filled very carefully I weighed the same bottle filled to the same mark in its neck with seawater and other waters successively which were all brought to the same degree of heat by a thermometer The results were as follow videlicet Grains Water obtained from the melted ice of the sea 1614 water Distilled rain water 1612 Water taken out of a water tub being a mixture 1615 of rain and snow water The sea water 1653 The residuum of the sea water from which the 1659 ice before mentioned had been taken To find the degree of cold in which sea water begins to freeze I made the following experiments I exposed to the open air a decanter filled with the sea water in which a thermometer was suspended the  of which reached to the middle of the widest part of the decanter a jelly glass filled with the same seawater in which also a thermometer was put resting on the bot tom was placed in the same exposure The result will be seen in the following table K k 2 Vessel252 Mr NAIRNE On Ice of Sea Water January 29 1776 Vessel Time

air two similar jars each 512 inches deep and 1710 inch in diameter one of which I shall for the sake of distinction call A the other B A was filled with the sea water B with water taken out of a water tub which was a mixture of rain and snow water In A two ther mometers were placed one rested on the bottom the upper part of the ball of the other was a quarter of an inch only below the surface

the ice 11 45 265 285 19 The jar was taken in from the open air and the lower thermometer lifted out of the ice to a sufficient height for the ob servation From these observations it seems that the freezing point of seawater should be fixed in FAHRENHEITS scale at 285 As the water when it began to freeze in two experi ments exhibited phenomena different from any I had observed before it may not be improper to subjoin an account of them AtMr NAIRNE on Ice of Sea Water 255 At fourteen minutes after eight in the morning of Ja nuary 31 I put the jar B of the second table containing the same water viz a mixture of rain and snow water in a window having the evening before placed a second thermometer in it the bulb of which was just below the surface of the water This as well as the thermometer at the bottom stood at  75 and the water was perfectly  the thermometer placed near the jar within the window was at 235 At twentyseven minutes after eight it be gan to freeze at the bottom of the jar the thermometers at the top and bottom standing alike at 27 The instant the crystals began to encompass the ball of the thermo meter below which they very soon did after it began to freeze the quicksilver rose in it to 32 the upper one continuing at 27 The crystals continued to shoot up ward and in less than half a minute reached the bulb of the thermometer at the surface which immediately rose to 32 At ten minutes before six in the evening of the same day I put the jar A of the second table into the open air its contents the same viz sea water The thermome ters in it were likewise the same not having been moved they both stood at 34 that in the open air at 195 At six oclock the thermometer above was at 31 that below at 2825 At this time I discovered some ice on the sur face of the water but as it was by candlelight I could not discern its first appearance At ten minutes after six the thermometer above was at 29 that below at 265 At fifteen minutes after six the upper thermometer at 5 285256 Mr NAIRNE on Ice of Sea Water 285 that below at 25 At seventeen minutes after six both the thermometers stood at 285 crystals having risen from the bottom covered the ball of that below on which it rose instantly from 25 to 285 The thermo meter in the open air continued as at first viz at 195 The scale of all the thermometers used in these experiments was FAHRENHEITS I have sent herewith specimens of the water viz of the seawater of the water procured from its melted ice and of the residuum of the seawater from which the ice was taken XV Easy

J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,106278,EXPERIMENTS ON WATER OBTAINED FROM THE MELTED ICE OF SEAWATER TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER IT BE FRESH OR NOT AND TO DETERMINE ITS SPECIFIC GRAVITY WITH RESPECT TO OTHER WATER ALSO EXPERIMENTS TO FIND THE DEGREE OF COLD IN WHICH SEAWATER BEGINS TO FREEZE BY MR EDWARD NAIRNE ADDRESSED TO SIR JOHN PRINGLE BART P R S,I206931,249 XIV EXPERIMENTS ON WATER OBTAINED FROM THE MELTED ICE OF SEAWATER TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER IT BE FRESH OR NOT AND TO DETERMINE ITS SPECIFIC GRAVITY WITH RESPECT TO OTHER WATER ALSO EXPERIMENTS TO FIND THE DEGREE OF COLD IN WHICH SEAWATER BEGINS TO FREEZE BY MR EDWARD NAIRNE ADDRESSED TO SIR JOHN PRINGLE BART P R S TO SIR JOHN PRINGLE BART P R S HAMPSTEAD S I R FEB 1 1776 IT HAVING BEEN SUGGESTED IN A CONVERSATION AT WHICH I WAS PRESENT THAT THE ICE OF SEAWATER IS NOT FRESH AND THAT IF THE ICE FOUND NEAR THE POLES BE REALLY SO IT MUST PROBABLY BE THE ICE OF FRESH WATER DIS CHARGED INTO THE SEA FROM LARGE RIVERS IN THOSE PARTS I THOUGHT THE PRESENT COLD WEATHER AFFORDED AN OPPORTUNITY TOO FAVOURABLE TO BE LOST OF ASCERTAINING BY EXPERIMENT WHETHER THE WATER OBTAINED FROM THE MELTED ICE OF SEA WATER BE FREE FROM THE TASTE OF SALT OR NOT OF COMPARING ITS GRAVITY WITH THAT OF THE SEAWATER C AND OF FIND ING THE DEGREE OF COLD IN WHICH THE LATTER BEGINS TO FREEZE AND I BEG LEAVE TO LAY BEFORE  AN ACCOUNT OF MY RESEARCHES IN THESE MATTERS AND OF THE METHODS I FOL LOWED IN MAKING THEM IF YOU SIR SHOULD THINK THEM WORTHY OF NOTICE AND WOULD COMMUNICATE THEM TO THE LEARNED BODY OVER WHICH YOU PRESIDE YOU WOULD CONFER AN HONOUR ON C VOL LXVI K K THE R FEB 1 1776250 MR NAIRNE ON ICE OF SEA WATER THE SEAWATER USED IN THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENTS WAS FURNISHED BY MR OWEN WHO KEEPS THE MINERAL WATER WAREHOUSE AT TEMPLE BAR WHO ASSURED ME THAT IT WAS TAKEN UP OFF THE NORTH FORELAND ON THE 27TH OF JANUARY 1766 AT TEN OCLOCK IN THE EVENING I FILLED A JAR 314 INCHES IN DIAMETER AND 612 INCHES DEEP WITH SEAWATER AND EXPOSED IT TO THE OPEN AIR THE THERMOMETER STANDING AT 15 AT NOON THE NEXT DAY ON TAKING IT IN I FOUND IT FROZEN VERY HARD EXCEPT A VERY LITTLE AT THE BOTTOM WHICH REMAINED QUITE FLUID I NOW SET IT BY A STOVE IN A HEAT OF 56 TO THAW THE ICE WHEN TAKEN IN FROM THE OPEN AIR WAS ONE QUARTER OF AN INCH ABOVE THE EDGE OF THE JAR WHEN THE JAR HAD CONTINUED IN THE DEGREE OF HEAT ABOVEMENTIONED DURING EIGHT HOURS I TOOK OUT THE ICE WHICH WAS THEN 312 INCHES LONG AND TWO INCHES IN DIAMETER ABOUT TWOTHIRDS OF THE WATER APPEARED TO REMAIN IN ORDER TO CLEAR THE ICE FROM ANY BRINE THAT MIGHT ADHERE TO IT I WASHED IT IN A PAIL OF PUMP WATER IN WHICH IT WAS SUFFERED TO REMAIN ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND THEN SET IT IN A FIEVE TO DRAIN OFF THE WATER IN WHICH IT HAD BEEN WASHED ON THE 29TH OF JANUARY 1776 I SET THE BEFOREMEN TIONED ICE IN A BASIN IN A HEAT OF ABOUT 46 IN WHICH IT CONTINUED NINE HOURS BEFORE THE WHOLE WAS DISSOLVED THE BULB OF A THERMOMETER RESTED ON THE ICE DURING THE TIME OF THE SOLUTION AND CONTINUED WITHOUT VARIATION AT 32 THE WATER THUS OBTAINED WAS TO MY PALATE PER FECTLY FREE FROM ANY TASTE OF SALT INMR NAIRNE ON ICE OF SEA WATER 251 IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN THE COMPARATIVE GRAVITY OF THIS WATER I FILLED A BOTTLE WITH IT TO A CERTAIN MARK IN ITS NECK WHICH WAS VERY NARROW AND WEIGHED THE BOTTLE SO FILLED VERY CAREFULLY I WEIGHED THE SAME BOTTLE FILLED TO THE SAME MARK IN ITS NECK WITH SEAWATER AND OTHER WATERS SUCCESSIVELY WHICH WERE ALL BROUGHT TO THE SAME DEGREE OF HEAT BY A THERMOMETER THE RESULTS WERE AS FOLLOW VIDELICET

THE SEA WATER FROM WHICH THE 1659 ICE BEFORE MENTIONED HAD BEEN TAKEN TO FIND THE DEGREE OF COLD IN WHICH SEA WATER BEGINS TO FREEZE I MADE THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENTS I EXPOSED TO THE OPEN AIR A

WATER VIZ A MIXTURE OF RAIN AND SNOW WATER IN A WINDOW HAVING THE EVENING BEFORE PLACED A SECOND THERMOMETER IN IT THE BULB OF WHICH WAS JUST BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE WATER THIS AS WELL AS THE THERMOMETER AT THE BOTTOM STOOD AT  75 AND THE WATER WAS PERFECTLY  THE THERMOMETER PLACED NEAR THE JAR WITHIN THE WINDOW WAS AT 235 AT TWENTYSEVEN MINUTES AFTER EIGHT IT BE GAN TO FREEZE AT THE

FREEZE THE QUICKSILVER ROSE IN IT TO 32 THE UPPER ONE CONTINUING AT 27 THE CRYSTALS CONTINUED TO SHOOT UP WARD AND IN LESS THAN HALF A MINUTE REACHED THE BULB OF THE THERMOMETER AT THE SURFACE WHICH IMMEDIATELY ROSE TO 32 AT TEN MINUTES BEFORE SIX IN THE EVENING OF THE SAME DAY I PUT THE JAR A OF THE SECOND TABLE INTO THE OPEN AIR ITS CONTENTS THE SAME VIZ SEA WATER THE THERMOME TERS IN IT WERE LIKEWISE THE SAME NOT HAVING BEEN MOVED THEY BOTH STOOD AT 34 THAT IN THE OPEN AIR AT 195 AT SIX OCLOCK THE THERMOMETER ABOVE WAS AT 31 THAT BELOW AT 2825 AT THIS TIME I DISCOVERED SOME ICE ON THE SUR FACE OF THE WATER BUT AS IT WAS BY CANDLELIGHT I COULD NOT DISCERN ITS FIRST APPEARANCE AT TEN MINUTES AFTER SIX THE THERMOMETER ABOVE WAS AT 29 THAT BELOW AT 265 AT FIFTEEN MINUTES AFTER SIX THE UPPER THERMOMETER AT 5 285256 MR NAIRNE ON ICE OF SEA WATER 285 THAT BELOW AT 25 AT SEVENTEEN MINUTES AFTER SIX BOTH THE THERMOMETERS STOOD AT 285 CRYSTALS HAVING RISEN FROM THE BOTTOM COVERED THE

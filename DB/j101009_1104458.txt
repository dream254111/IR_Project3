several months during which time the wife returned to the home of her father where the husband also repaired immediately on his release instead of returning to the homestead Being in financial straits he then conveyed the homestead property without his wife joining in the deed No objection was raised to this transaction till sev eral years later when it was sought to recover the property on the ground that the conveyance was illegal in that the wife was not made a party thereto Defendant thereupon to sustain his pur chase attempted to show abandonment of the homestead and that consequently the wifes joinder was not necessary The Supreme Court of Mississippi while determining that the premises had become abandoned by the residence at the home of the wifes father yet held that the detention in jail did not amount to abandonment which nec essarily implies that the act should be done on the partys own voli tion Lindsey v Holly 63 Southern Reporter 222 Burglary by Breaking Out of

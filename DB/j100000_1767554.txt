have a cold bath summer and winter It seemed likely especially in winter that the sudden application of in tensely cold water to the whole surface of the skin too suddenly raised the internal bloodpressure and hence the oozing of the blood through the walls of the capillary vessels lying beneath the lining membrane of the throat or larynx or possibly the lungs In any case whatever the true explanation may be the fact stands out that the unpleasant symptom disappeared as soon as the temperature of the icy cold water was reasonably increased The practice of taking a cold bath is so universal nowadays that it is perhaps as well to know that although the strong man may indulge in it with unmixed benefit it may cause in the weak man a symptom which fills him with anxiety Lannelongues Treatment of Tuberculosis The object aimed at by this method as stated by the Lancet is to bring about a sclerosis of the tubercular tissue whatever may be its seat The cases thus far treated have been mainly those of surgical tuberculosis Experiments have shown that chloride of zinc produces a re markable fibroid change in the normal tissues of animals and as might be expected the same fibroid transformation is brought about by the same agent in morbid tissues in general including the tubercular This chemical compound may be said to fix the anatomical elements by killing them for it obliterates the capilla ries and smaller vessels around where it has been deposited An inflammatory action is thus set up in the vascular walls which narrows the calibre of the surrounding vessels for a considerable distance from the initial point But over and above this another local change of the highest import is brought about Very rap idly  even within a few hours  there is produced in the altered tissues by transmigration and probably also by cell proliferation an enormous afflux of new anatomical elements These young cells cause fresh cedema of the periphery of the granulation growths and infiltrate the tubercular neoplasm to the fullest ex tent From this moment the struggle sets in between the accu mulated elements and the bacilli especially between the migratory cells and the microbes to the detriment of the latter However it may be as to the strife between cell and bacillus the elements of the morbid growth which the chloride of zinc had destroyed are reabsorbed slowly and finally disappear The young cells on the contrary organize with great activity and form a firm fibrous tissue which is met with in appreciable quantity as early as the day next after the injection Following the sclerosis in articular fungosities there is produced a thickening and subsequent condensation of osseous tissue if the periosteum be involved in the reparative process as was the case in the examples of osteoarthritic disease cited by the author The remote results so far as it is yet possible to judge show a marked tendency for the sclerosed elements to be replaced by a more pliable connective tissue As a consequence the diseased parts regain their suppleness and their form while locomotor functions are preserved entirely or at least to the limits present at the beginning of the treatment The Artificial Production of Dental Caries For the past year Mr Sewill following other experimenters in the same field has been endeavoring to produce caries in extracted teeth and certainly the microscopical appearances presented by the sections shown at the Odontological Society says the Lancet differed but little from those of natural caries He found that the best mixture of organic substances for the purpose was one part of bread to eight of saliva Meat with saliva remained alka line and if a small quantity of acid were added became again rapidly alkaline Albumen whether as white of egg or other forms acted in the same way Saliva and starch produced little acid which was soon exhausted The teeth were immersed in the mixture in glassstoppered bot tles and kept at a temperature of 350 to 379 C The bottles were unstoppered about once a day for examination this of course admitted air and if the mixture became putrid it at once showed NCE 73 an alkaline reaction in which case the teeth were taken out well washed and the mixture renewed The mixture became rapidly acid and remained so unless putrefaction to a large degree su pervened for from three to five weeks The acids present were acetic and lactic of the former 5 per cent and of the latter 05 per cent were found aftersthree weeks The effects upoi the tissues were precisely the sameboth macroscopical and microscopical as in natural caries As in natural caries the decay was found to commence most readily in places where there was illformed enamel or flaws or fissures which allowed access to the dentine in which tissue the caries progressed more rapidly than in enamel Cementum resisted longer than enamel but at length yielded and allowed the dentine beneath to be invaded Discoloration was often present and it was found that carious dentine readily took up stains from such substances as are often admitted to the mouth in medicines or articles of food Microscopically the translucent zone is well shown also the  pipestems appearance in trans verse sections and the dentinal tubes are filled with microorgan isms just as in natural caries The conclusions that Mr Sewill draws from these experiments and from the facts that caries takes place in natural teeth which are used as artificial substitutes are that caries is entirely due to external agents and that vital action in no way modifies the dis ease NOTES AND NEWS THE university extension work has been organized in Chicago Cleveland Indianapolis Fort Wayne and Altoona are among the latest applicants for branches  Accessions to the membership of the Society for the Exten sion of University Teaching continue to be sent in at the rate of nearly a hundred a week The best indication of the national character of the work is found in the wide area from which these applications are received every State in the Union being now represented on the rolls  The work of the St Paul Minn Academy of Science con tinues to meet with increasing support and encouragement The museum is receiving many additions its rooms being permawent and well adapted for the purpose Persons willing or desirous of adding to its collections by loan gift or exchange are invited to correspond with Professor W F Phelps chairman of the com mittee on museum or with Mr C B Scott curator It is grati fying to learn that the university extension classes organized un der the auspices of the academy and conducted by professors from the State University from Carlton College and other nearby points have proven quite successful and promise much for the future  The heavy sentence of four years imprisonment in addition to fines imposed in France recently on four persons connected with the alleged sale of the secret of melinite to an English firm gives a new turn to that strange affair It was recently announced by the French minister of war that M Turpin the inventor and Captain Tripon6 the agent of the English firm really had nothing of value to the French government to negotiate for and that the most important part of the invention the means of exploding melinite after it has been united with another substance in the shell  remained in the sole possession of the government This second substance according to the New York Times is cresilite a nitrocresol obtained from a coaltar product and after twothirds of the space in the shell has been filled with it melinite is rammed in a fact which sufficiently indicates that both products can be safety handled and can be exploded only by a powerful de tonator In its latest report the Board of Health of the city of Boston says We are of the same opinion now as we were when we made our last annual report that the large expense to the city and the perpetual nuisance which attends the storing and handling of garbage should be abolished by burning it in the kitchen where it first appears as waste and before decomposition has be gun to make it offensive By this method the only expense to be74 SCIENCE incurred would be the purchase of the pail or other attachment for the kitchen range which would be less in a term of five years than the present cost of receptacles for storing the garbage It is a mistake to throw this material upon the fire for then the com bustion is imperfect and very offensive odors are given off It should always be placed in a receptacle specially and conveniently arranged for the purpose in some part of the stove The ordinary heat of the stove will dry out all moisture and leave charcoal to be burned like other fuel There are several patented devices already in the market for this purpose One of them is obtained only in the construction of the stove and consists of a receptacle in the side of the stove in which the garbage is put completely desiccated and then dumped into the fire Another consists of a small pail arranged for the purpose can be applied to any stove and is said to answer the needs well  At a recent meeting of the Chicago Medical Society says the Medical Record Dr J Frank reported a case where a man every July shed his skin He was taken with feverish tremors increas ing almost to paroxysms He undressed lay down and within a few minutes the skin of the chest began to turn red The redness rapidly extended over the entire skin and the feverish tremors continued uninterrupted for about twelve hours Then he arose dressed and walked about in perfect health The skin now com menced to peel and ten hours later it began to come off in great patches From the arms and legs it could be pulled off exactly like gloves or stockings As the old skin came away a new epi dermis as soft and pink as a babys was revealed This new skin was very sensitive the patient has to wear softened gloves and moccasins for about a week After the old cuticle had been en tirely removed the finger and toe nails began to drop off new nails literally crowding them out Finally the change was com plete the man had a new skin and a new outfit of nails and was ready to return to the mines The shedding began in his first year and recurred every July thereafter  It is worthy of remark that the idea of university extension has taken root in other than Englishspeaking countries A Danish correspondent writes to the Oxford Gazette in regard to work in Denmark About five years ago the undergraduates of the Uni versity of Copenhagen undertook to give free instruction to the working classes and others who were in need of such instruction Courses were given in languages natural science and all subjects commonly taught in high schools The rooms in which the in struction was given were lent free by th3 schools and other insti tutions The movement succeeded and after three years the organizing committee applied for and got State aid to which however no conditions were attached It was only an encourage ment given to the brave efforts of the students The undergrad uates now give free legal advice through competent men and the movement is extending in every direction Branches of the cen tral society in Copenhagen have already been established in the chief towns of Denmark and it is only a question of time when the whole country will be covered by a network of similar in struction   Some time ago says Engineering Mr Bryan Donkin made a number of experiments on the flow of heat through the walls of a steam engine cylinder using for the purpose delicate thermome ters At a recent meeting of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers Professor E H Hall gave the results of some pre liminary experiments on the same subject made with a thermo pile consisting of a plug of iron which was screwed into a 1inch hole in the cylinder and had a small hole bored through its centre Down this hole was passed a nickel plug attached at one end to a thin iron plate which was also attached to the iron plug The outer ends of the iron and nickel plugs were connected to a deli cate galvanometer in the usual way and the nickel was of course insulated from all contact with the iron save by the thin plate already mentioned Three thermopiles constructed on this system were used In the first the plate connecting the two elements was onehalf a millimetre thick in the second one millimetre thick and in the third two millimetres thick The engine cut off at about j stroke and ran at sixty revolutions per minute It was found that using the plug with the onehalf millimetre plate the VOL XVIII No 444 temperature at cutoff was below the maximum and fell rapidly during exhaustion The ebb and flow of heat in the cylinder walls was very evident Heat rushes into these walls at admission but at cutoff begins to travel back into the cylinder again and con tinues during exhaust to flow from the walls and to boil off any water that may be in the cylinder Professor Hall thinks that there is evidence to show that in the case of the engine on which he was experimenting a layer of water remained in the cylinder walls from the previous stroke thus increasing condensation Captain Cowell of the British ship Drumeltan reports as follows to the Hydrographic Office on the use of oil in stormy weather at sea I have for eighteen or twenty years used oil bags in heavy running especially in running down the easting on Australian and New Zealand voyages from England they have always acted well the ship running considerably drier with less sea on board I have always used canvas bags first filled with oakum and then the oil poured in The bags are hung at each cathead with a rather long lanyard so that it will sometimes dip in the water as the ship rises and falls In my last voyage in this ship in the Pacific off Patagonia I layto for seventytwo hours in a furious gale from westsouthwest but did not ship any heavy water had one oilbag at the weather cathead and another at the mizzen rigging with long lanyards 4masted ship Nothing but spray came on board I learned afterwards that a good many vessels were damaged in that gale or rather hurricane Two days afterwards April 15 1890 I myself passed the Adamant of Hamburg dismasted and abandoned I always keep two oilbags filled with oakum ready for oil at short notice and I invariably destroy the old bags as thpy are liable to dry hard and become useless  Referring to a statement which has been publicly made that the adoption of electric lighting in place of gas at the office of the Savings Bank Department of the General Post Office London has been followed by a marked reduction in the amount of sick leave the Lancet says it has good authority for believing that the state ment in question is substantially correct Although the time which has as yet elapsed  two years  since the introduction of the new illuminant has been insufficient for the collection of trust worthy statistics the paper named thinks there is every reason to believe that electric lighting will prove to be much more whole some than ordinary gas flames An electric lamp does not com pete for the oxygen of the apartment in which it is placed and this circumstance gives it a marked advantage over any open flame It cannot like some forms of gasburner be used to pro mote ventilation but in ordinary situations its harmlessness is a much more important property  An antiquarian find which will excite interest all over Eu rope says the Academy has lately been made in Roevemose peat bog near Hobro in Jutland Aalborg Amt The objects are all of silver the principal piece being a very large basin on which have been fastened plates of silver hammered out with figures of men women and animals The basin is twentysix Danish inches in diameter but scarcely eight inhes high One or two pieces are apparently wanting but it is hoped they will turn up when the moss is minutely examined The eyeholes of the figures are now empty but had evidently been filled with colored glass One of the plates which is nearly seventeen inches long shows warriors with helmets and other ornaments One figure is a god with a wheel at his side and on another are two elephants A third shows a horned god in a sitting posture with his legs crossed ori entalwise All these have apparently nothing to do with Northern mythology as was at first supposed The whole find has now reached the Danish National Museum and we see that these pieces belong to the godlore of the Gallic peoples The god with the wheel for instance is the Gallic sun god The whole is the work of a Gallic artist at that early period when the Roman and Gallic peoples first came in contact Allowing time for these things to wander so far north the date would seem to be as regards Den mark the first century before Christ Other things belonging to this Gallic group have been found previously in this country The total weight of precious metal hitherto exhumed is about twenty Danish poundsAUGUST 7 189I SCIENCE The attendance at the lectures of the Society for the Exten been decided as to any scheme of irrigation and as a committee sion of University Teaching for the past season as reported from would be appointed to consider the whole question it might be the general offices of the society at Philadelphia was exception considered as suspended for the present and the committee had ally large as compared with any previous experience either in thought it best to wait before taking any further action but they this country or England and as a result many may hesitate to would not lose sight of this important matter and would oppose form centres because they see no prospect of getting two or three to the utmost of their power any engineering scheme which would hundred to follow the lectures of the course Perhaps it may be involve injury or destruction to this worldrenowned spot Gen well in this connection to notice the fact that in the printed report eral Donnelly moved the adoption of the report and the motion of the London society the average number present at each lecture was seconded by Sir Edmund Henderson and agreed to The in many centres is found to vary between eight and fifty In committee for the coming year was then elected and a discussion many cases certainly the attendance was much larger but it is subsequently took place as to the proposed scheme for barring by no means clear that the smaller centres were not fully as suc the Nile below Philee the opinion of the meeting being evidently cessful in several important particulars It has been observed for strongly opposed to the adQption of any system of irrigation example that the percentage of those in attendance at the lec which should involve damage to the temple Mr J Bryce MP tures who also took part in the class work was greater in the spoke of the wanton injury which was often inflicted on monu smaller groups Since so many of the benefits of extension work ments in Egypt and said that he thought it would be necessary are dependent upon a participation in the lectures by the class in dealing with that matter to bring the question of jurisdiction one must conclude that proportionately the smaller centres were to the attention of those from whom any system of inspection or more successful Wherever there are a score of persons who wish care was to emanate to hear a given course there should be no hesitation on account of the small numbers Better results in many ways will be ob tained under these circumstances  During recent years a good deal has been said amongst ma rine zoologists of the use as a food supply that might be made of the enormous numbers of copepoda that swarm in the surface waters of the sea says a Norwegian correspondent of Nature and the Prince of Monaco has pointed out the value this widelvdis tributed nutritious matter might have to shipwrecked sailors but I am not aware that any one has yet actually made the experi ment of cooking and eating copepoda so the following record may be of some interest While townetting during the last few days about the North Cape we have had some large hauls of copepoda and it occured to us last night while watching the midnight sun off the entrance to the Lyngen fjord that one gathering might be spared from the preserving bottle and devoted to the saucepan We put out one of the smaller townets 3 feet long mouth one foot in diameter from 1140 PM to midnight the ship going dead slow and traversing in all say a mile and a half during the twenty minutes The net when hauled in contained about three tablespoonfuls of a large red copepod Calanus finmarchicus I think apparently a pure gathering  what Haeckel would call a monotonic plankton We conveyed our material at once to the galley washed it in a fine colander boiled it for a few minutes with butter salt and pepper poured it into a dish covered it with a thin layer of melted butter set it in ice to cool and stiffen had it this morning for breakfast on thin bread and butter and found it most excellent The taste is less pronounced than that of shrimps and has more the flavor of lobster Our twenty min utes haul of the small net through a mile or two of sea made when cooked in butter a dishful which was shared by eight peo ple and would probably have formed with biscuit or bread a nourishing meal for one person It would apparently in these seas be easy to gather very large quantities which might be pre served in tins or dishes like potted shrimps The annual meeting of the Society for the Preservation of the Monuments of Ancient Egypt was held last week says Nature of July 23 in the rooms of the Society of Antiquaries at Burlington House Lord Wharncliffe president occupied the chair The report stated that there was little to report of success attending the proceedings of the society for the past year Its energies had been directed principally to two points the necessity for an official inspector or superintendent in Egypt whose duty should be the care of the ancient monuments and an endeavor to do something towards arresting the gradual destruction of the Great Temple at Karnak Reports concerning a proposed scheme for barring the Nile below Philee to make a vast reservoir for purposes of irriga tion had appeared in the public papers from time to time and recently various more definite communications had been received by the committee on the same subject The result would be it was acknowledged to completely cover this beautiful island and temple with water There had been some correspondence on this subject with the authorities in Egypt but as nothing had as yet  The most remarkable example of reclamation by means of artesian wellwater says United States Irrigation Commissioner Hinton in an official report is found in the desert provinces or departments of Algeria under the French rule The area offi cially given of French Algeria is 184465 square miles The outlying portion is put at 135000 square miles In this total of over 329415 square miles onehalf belongs to the Sahara or desert The European population in 1887 was about 250000 the natives and naturalized were 3328549 making a total of 3578549 Cultivation by means of flowing wellwaters has been sedulously fostered by the French colonial government for both political and economic reasons Such wells as a means of reclamation began systematically to be bored in 1857 the French engineer M Jus having demonstrated in 1856 that the desert was endowed with large supplies of underground water The total number of wells that have been bored since that date in the departments of Al giers Oran and Constantine is stated at 13135 These wells range from 75 to 400 feet in depth and the low pressure common to the majority of them forces the water to a distance of about two feet above the ground The waters are then collected in small ditches whiQh convey them to the vineyards datetrees and fields of durra millet wheat etc which comprise the chief products In all about 12000000 acres have been reclaimed in this way The government bores are at least onetenth of the whole number As an illustration of the reclamation brought about by this well irrigation the following figures from a report made in 1885 will be of value but they relate solely to the culti vation of the grape for winemaking purposes In the province of Algeria there are 60322 acres in Constantine 25021 acres in Oran 26114 Under this species of cultivation Algeria is becom ing a great winegrowing country It sent to France during eleven months of 1886 10513966 gallons of wine and of ciderin the same year 219277124 gallons were made The datepalm is the largest product of the desert oases proper The total area un der colonization or settled occupation in 1887 is given at 49400 000 acres under cultivation by irrigation ih wheat barley oats vines olives dates tobacco etc at 17041133 The forest plan tations cover 5000000 acres Professor Louis Bevier of Rutgers College has been appointed to organize the work of university extension in connection with that institution Professor Jeremiah W Jenks of the University of Indiana has accepted the chair of social political and municipal institu tions in Cornell University  W F Durand late of the Agricultural College of Michigan is now professor of mechanical engineering at Pardue University

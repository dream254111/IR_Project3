American Cities By LANE W LANCASTER Instructor in Political Science University of Pennsylvania IT has long been a commonplace among students of taxation that the provision of revenues and the wise control of expenditures of city govern ments constitute a vital problem in the field of public finance Briefly stated the problem has been to provide by equitable means enough revenue to permit efficient performance of the many new functions which public opinion has devolved upon local gov ernments The progressive urbaniza tion of our people has accentuated this problem while it has supplied us with proofs of its seriousness In 1909 there were in the United States 158 cities with populations ex ceeding 30000 and with an aggregate population of 25600000 Of these 158 cities 16 had populations in excess of 300000 Financial statistics for that year show per capita revenue receipts of 261 and governmental cost payments of 3011 per capita By 1916 there were 213 such cities with an aggregate population of over 32000000 Per capita receipts and payments were 3083 and 3311 respectively In 1918 the latest year for which figures are available 227 cities over 30000 population had a totalpopulation of well over 34000000 Each of the inhabitants of these cities made a contribution to the citys treas ury of 3275 and bore as his share of expenditures a burden of 3416 In normal times expenditures of local gov ernments amount to 45 per cent of the expenditures of all governmental units federal state and local An inquiry into the sources of revenue of American cities should therefore be of more than ordinary interest During 1918 the revenue receipts of the 227 cities with a population over 30000 amounted to 1194094899 Table I shows the aggregate figures from each source and the per capita and per cent distribution of this total It will be seen from this table that taxes account for slightly over 70 per cent of all revenue receipts By taxes as the term is used in the reports of the Census Bureau is meant all compulsory revenues other than fines and special assessments The term therefore includes general and special property taxes poll and business taxes and various license taxes whether or not accompanied by the issuance of a permit and has this meaning wherever used in this paper Of the total of over 790000000 re ceived from taxes nearly 722000 000 or 913 per cent is derived from taxes on property Of this latter sum over 705000000 is produced by the general property tax the remaining 16000000 being secured from special property taxes The latter consisted largely of taxes on bank stock and cor porations nearly threefourths of which was collected by Massachusetts and New York cities In fact taxes on property accounted for 642 per cent of all revenue receipts Over 66000000 was produced by business and license taxes the larger part of this total 1 The term revenue receipts as used by the Census Bureau includes those sums accruing to the city on revenue account and does not include such receipts as arise from the sale of invest ments and supplies These latter are known as nonrevenue receipts Revenue receipts must not be regarded as net for the govern mental cost payments for the carrying on of the recognized municipal functions must be charged off against the revenue receipts124 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY TABLE I TOTAL

source were less in 1918 than in any year since 1907 largely be cause of war conditions affecting the construction of street improvements Chart I is intended to show in graphic form the per cent

American cities In 1918 215 of the 227 cities over 30000 population reported receipts from special assessments totalling 72673785 While this source ac counted for only 65 per cent of all revenue receipts many cities re ceived as high as 20 per cent the higher figures being more common in the group of cities with populations between 30000 and 50000 Table V gives the aggregate and per cent

populations between 300000 and 500000 but this is due to the large grant made to Washington D C by the Federal Government which in 1918 constituted 398 per cent of all the revenue re ceipts of the

considerably larger proportion of the receipts of New England cities than is the case in the southern group The statement often made concerning the prevalence of business taxes in the South would seem to be substantiated by the figures in this table although the discrepancy between the figure for this source and the corresponding1N8 THE ANNALS OU THE AMERICAN ACADEMY figure in the New England group

to the southern cities in their returns from public service enterprises they are the lowest of all the groups in the proportion of receipts from subventions only 12 per cent being returned from this

latter while in Jacksonville the receipts from this source are actually higher than the return from the property tax the fig ures being 394 per cent and 31 per cent respectively The southern cities also show greater returns from subventions 78 per cent of all their receipts being derived from in 1918 ten cities with populations exceeding 500000 The aggregate population of these ten cities was

source being 25 per cent higher than the average of 642 per cent for all cities over 30000 population It will be noticed that when the figure for property taxes falls below the general average for all cities the difference is made up as in Chicago St Louis and Boston by a much higher per centage of business taxes or by a comparatively higher return from special assessments as in the cases of

all cities Of this the general property tax is by far the most important special property taxes being insignificant for most of the cities Chart IV which shows the per capita revenue receipts for all cities and for the ten largest cities illustrates this fact in a striking way In spite of the rather high returns from special assessments in Chicago Cleveland and Detroit this group of cities shows an average considerably lower than that for all cities Sub ventions are a comparatively insig nificant source in these cities the per cent figure being a little less than half the general average All the sums received by these cities in the form of subventions were from state govern ments and more than 90 per cent were for education Revenues received from the grant ing of rights in and over highways from the rent of public properties and from interest on the investment of public funds are of comparatively greater importance in the larger cities for obvious reasons More than half of these receipts or 52 per cent is from interest derived largely from sinking funds 238 per cent is made up of receipts from highway privileges and 242 per cent from the rent of investment properties Philadelphia received 159 per cent of all its revenue receipts from these sources 924 per cent being derived from rents and interest On the other hand 735 per cent of Chicagos receipts from these sources arise from the grant of highway privileges in the main to its street railway system New York re ceives as interest on sinking funds nearly threefourths of its receipts from this class of sources This group of cities receives 98 per cent of all revenue receipts from the operation of public service enterprises slightly less than the average for all cities over 30000 Of the total receipts for the ten largest cities from this source New York City alone produces 397 per cent Water supply systems account for 775 per cent of all such receipts as against 781 per cent for all cities over 30000 The only other single important source is the earnings of wharves and docks which account for 119 per cent of such receipts Chart V is intended to show the per cent distribution of the

By comparing this chart with chart I p 124 showing the same figures for 227 cities several differences are noted In the large cities the only depend able source of revenue the tax on real property is already considerably higher than the average for all cities Business taxes in the large cities are exactly equal to the average figure These are in fact the only sources of revenue which are theoretically ca pable of further expansion Special132 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY property taxes now only an insig nificant source of revenue promise to be even less important in the future with the present tendency as it is to reserve such sources to the state gov ernments It is moreover very doubtful if the tax on real property can be made much more productive in these cities under present methods of valuation and assessment and it is clear that the other sources are not dependable If the present tendency toward separation of sources persists there seem to be but three alternatives open to the large cities in their search for new sources of revenue In the first place taxes on property might with a greater measure of justice to all concerned be made more productive by a separate assessment of land and improvements with the heavier burden on the former The two secondclass cities of Pennsylvania Pittsburgh and Scranton are now empowered by law to adopt such a system Second there seems to be no reason why business taxes could not with justice be more extensively used by these cities Last of all it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that if the administration of special property taxes is to devolve on state govern ments the development of a system of subventions will eventually offer a measure of relief to the cities which are already the homes of oneseventh of our people

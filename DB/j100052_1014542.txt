US WITH PROOFS OF ITS SERIOUSNESS IN 1909 THERE WERE IN THE UNITED STATES 158 CITIES WITH POPULATIONS EX CEEDING 30000 AND WITH AN AGGREGATE POPULATION OF 25600000 OF THESE 158 CITIES 16 HAD

PRESENT METHODS OF VALUATION AND ASSESSMENT AND IT IS CLEAR THAT THE OTHER SOURCES ARE NOT DEPENDABLE IF THE PRESENT TENDENCY TOWARD SEPARATION OF SOURCES PERSISTS THERE SEEM TO BE BUT THREE ALTERNATIVES OPEN TO THE LARGE CITIES IN THEIR SEARCH FOR NEW SOURCES OF REVENUE IN THE FIRST PLACE TAXES ON PROPERTY MIGHT WITH A GREATER MEASURE OF JUSTICE TO ALL CONCERNED BE MADE MORE PRODUCTIVE BY A SEPARATE ASSESSMENT OF LAND AND IMPROVEMENTS WITH THE HEAVIER BURDEN ON THE FORMER THE TWO SECONDCLASS CITIES OF PENNSYLVANIA PITTSBURGH AND SCRANTON ARE NOW EMPOWERED BY LAW TO ADOPT SUCH A SYSTEM SECOND THERE SEEMS TO BE NO REASON WHY BUSINESS TAXES COULD NOT WITH JUSTICE BE MORE EXTENSIVELY USED BY THESE CITIES LAST OF ALL IT IS DIFFICULT TO AVOID THE CONCLUSION THAT IF THE ADMINISTRATION OF SPECIAL PROPERTY TAXES IS TO DEVOLVE ON STATE GOVERN MENTS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SYSTEM OF SUBVENTIONS WILL EVENTUALLY OFFER A MEASURE OF RELIEF TO THE CITIES WHICH ARE ALREADY THE HOMES OF ONESEVENTH OF OUR PEOPLE

the Promise he had made some years ago that he would do so He acknow ledges himself much obliged to Martinius and his Atlas Sinicus as also to Michael Boim a Polonian Philippo Marino a Jesuit of Ge noa and two other of the same Society viz Henry Roth of Aus burg and John Gruber an Austrian whereof the latter went A 1656 over Land from Rome through Anatolia Armenia Persia Ormus Cambaja and India to Macao the famous Port of China and thence to Pekin the Court of that Empire whence two years after he came back to Rome accompanied for a part of the way by the Jesuit Albert Dorvitte traversing by Land in a manner the whole breadth of China and a great part of the confining Tartary and so further through the Mogols Dominions to Agra where the said Dorville dying the abovementioned Henry Roth supplyed his place in accomplishing this Voyage The Book it self a large Folio is divided into 6 Parts The three first and the last being besides the design of these Tracts we shall but glance at taking only notice First That they pretend to perswade the Reader that Christianity was spread over all Asia by St Thomas the Apostle and his Successors and hath been there continued though not without great Eclipses to these very times And here the chinochaldaean Monument said to have been erected several hundred years since in China and sound out A 1625 is with great labour asserted and interpreted Next That the Rise of the Idolatry in those remote parts and their different Ceremonies in Worship is confronted with those An cient ones of Egypt Lastly that a large Account is given of the Chinese Letters their Figure Power c But we hasten to the Fourth Book as belonging to our Sphere That485 That undertakes to describe the Curiosities and Productions of Na ture and Art in China Here the Author having premised some thing of the advantagious Scituation of China and its Political Government Calculated also both the Number of its Inhabi tants which according to him amount to 200 Millions of Men besides Women Children Officers and Eunuchs and the Annual Revenue of the Emperour which he makes to be 150 Millions of GoldCrowns he relateth many considerable pro ductions and works of Nature in that Country As 1 Mountains very odd for shape burning and raising of Tem pests 2 Isles to the number of 99 all turned into one under the same extent of space they had when they were divided by water 3 Lakes some changing Copper into Iron and causing storms when any thing is cast into them and others sprung up by Earthquakes 4 Rivers whereof one is said to be of a Blew colour in Au tumn and for the rest of the year Limpid Another to be cold at the top and very hot beneath 5 Fiery Wells serving to boyl meat over Perhaps of the same Nature with that here in England we described above 6 Plants as 1 some Roses changing their Colour twice a day Whence the Author takes occasion to speak of that Plant which grows at Rome in the Garden of one Signior Corvino calld Viola Nocturna changing its colour sensibly according to the degrees of the rising and declining of the Sun destitute of all smell in the daytime but having a very fragrant one in the night 2 A Farinaceous or Mealy Tree serving to make Bread of it 3 Leaves of certain Trees standing on the side of a Lake which falling into the water become like black Birds which he ascrib eth to the Seminal parts of some Eggs broken on those Trees filld with Birds nests 4 The and its wholesomeness as to the suppressing of Vapours and preventing the Stone 5 A kind of WickerTree which as if it were a Rope twisted by Nature a bout an inch thick creeps along upon the Earth sometimes the length of 120 paces much embarassing the way but serving for Cables to Ships Seats Hurdles Beds Matts enduring no Ver min and being cool and refreshing in hot Seasons 6 The CalambaWood that it is esteemd by some to be a kind of Len tiscum486 tiscum by others a sort of Terebinth but of a nobler rank by vertue of that Climat which makes the Author suggest that care should be taken to have it brought into Europe and carefully cultivated there 7 Rhubarb of which he observes that be cause the vertue of its Roots if they be exposed to dry hastily soon evaporats therefore the skilfull lay them upon a Table within doors and turn them several times a day to incorporate and fix the Juyce the better and then string them and expose them to the Wind in a shade altogether free from the Sun beams 8 Pine Trees of which he saith some are so big that eight Men can hardly Fathom them 9 Canes so big that they can make as many Barrels of them as they have internodes or Joynts 10 Trees sweating a Gum calld Cie like the drop pings of Turpentine which Gum as long as tis not dryed emits a very unwholsome and dangerous steam To passe by the Polo nie Tree producing fruit without any blossoms immediately out of its Trunk as big as one man can well carry and that kind of FigTree that bears Leaves as big as to wrap up a man in c 7 Animals Here he discourseth of the Musk Dear and the several Compositions of Musk the SeaHorse and Wild Men Offome Birds no where seen but in China as he thinks and a mong them a Woolbearing Hen Of Fishes in Summer flying out of the Sea seeking their food like Birds and in Autumn returning to the Sea particularly of a Fish of a very exquisite taste called Hoancioyu or the Croceous Fish Further of SeaComs going of ten ashore and fighting with the LandComs Of Bats of a vast bigness eaten by the Chinese as a delicious meat Of the Serpent that breeds the Antidotal stone where of he relates many experi ments to verifie the relations of its vertue Which may invite the Curator of the Royal Society to make the like tryal there being such a stone in their Repository sent them from the East Indies Again of Silk Worms spinning twice a year and yielding a double Crop 8 Fossils where occurs the Relation 1 Of an odd Specular stone representing the figure of the Moon in all her Appearan ces when exposed to Her 2 Of an Earth called quei very Cos metick and abstersive of all blemishes of the face 3 A Mineral cerusse blended of Lead and Antimony 4 Of Asbestus that can be drawn and spun the way of which he affirms to have descri bed L 12 Mundi sui subterranei 5 The Matter that makes Porcel lan which he affirms to be nothing else but a transparent Sand which487 which they soak in water and then reduce to a Masse or Dough and so bake it Not a word of the way of giving it the colour which it seems they keep as a great secret They have Gold and Silver Mines but dig them not pretending the danger and trou ble in the work and contenting themselves with the Filings and Dust of Gold which they gather out of the Mud and Sand of Rivers and Fountains The Fifth Book contains an account of their Works of Archi tecture and other ingenious Mechanick Arts Where he speaks 1 Of their stupendious Bridges one of 360 Perches long and 1 12 Perch broad without any Arch standing upon 300 Pillars with acute Angles on both opposite sides all the stones being of an equal size and shape Another built from Mountain to Moun tain by one only Arch 400 cubits long 500 cubits high whence tis called Pons volans from the surface of the Saffrany River running under it This is represented for the satisfaction of the Curious by Figure 1 Fig 1 2 Vast Towns but whose Houses are generally but one Story high and good reason therefore the Towns should be very big They are for the most part built of Timber 3 Turrets very artificiall whereof one is all of Porcellan 4 The China Wall 300 German Leagues long 30 Cubits high 12 in some places 15 Cubits broad so that 12 Horses can very conveniently go in front on it built 215 years before Christ by the Emperour Pius a brave and most Warlike Prince and dispatcht in the space of five years commonly it is defen ded by a Million of men A Pattern of this also was thought fit to exhibit here by Figure 11 Fig II 5 The Channel that passeth from one extream of China to the other having some 24 Sluces to retain water when tis necessary a work of incredible industry and extraordinary advantage 6 Vast Bells one whereof at Pekin weighs 120000 pounds whereas that of Erfurd in Germany hitherto esteemed to be one of the biggest in the World weighs but 25400 pounds As for their ingenious Inventions this Author mentions chiefly 1 Their Vernice of which he sets down some Receipts both for the Red and Black together with the way of their Use and Ap plication as he received them both from an Augustinian Fryar affirming that it differs not at all from that of China 2 Their way of Printing invented long before that in Europe giving a large description of the same 3 Gun488 3 Gunpowder which he also saith they had before the Euro peans 4 Bellfounding These are the

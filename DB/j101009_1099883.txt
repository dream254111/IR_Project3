THE EMBANKMENT AND AREA INTO THE MILLS SERIOUSLY DAMAGING THE PROP ERTY THE MILL OCCUPIES LOT 361 IN THE PLAN OF THE CITY AND THE FIRST MILL WAS BUILT UPON IT IN THE YEAR OF 1833 THE LOT AS WELL AS TWELFTH AND CANAL STREETS IS BELOW THE LEVEL OF THE OLD BASIN AND ON THE CANAL STREET SIDE OF IT THERE WAS A DEEP RAVINE EXTENDING THENCE TO JAMES RIVER PRIOR TO THE YEAR 1833 THE OLD CULVERT RAN FROM NEAR THE CORNER OF ELEVENTH AND CARY STREETS ACROSS BASIN STREET AND THAT PART OF THE BASIN EMBANKMENT NOW OCCUPIED AS THE ROADBED OF THE CHESAPEAKE  OHIO RAILWAY COMPANY AND EMPTIED ON LOT 361 IT DOES NOT CLEARLY APPEAR BY WHOM THIS CULVERT WAS ORIGINALLY CON STRUCTED BUT IT DOES APPEAR THAT FOR OVER 60 YEARS IT WAS IN THE OPEN CONTINUOUS AND EXCLUSIVE USE OF THE CITY OF RICHMOND IN THE YEAR 1833 THE COMMON COUNCIL OF THE CITY AUTHORIZED THE COMMISSIONERS OF STREETS TO CONTRACT FOR THE EXTENSION OF THE CULVERT SO AS TO GUARD AGAINST ITS BEING DAMMED UP AT ITS SOUTHERN EXTREMITY BY THE EXCAVATION OF THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE MILL AND THE YEAR FOL LOWING THE COMMISIONERS WERE DIRECTED TO CONTRACT FOR ITS FURTHER EXTENSION IN THE YEAR 1836 THE COUNCIL ADOPTED A RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW CULVERT UP D OR CARY STREET TO NINTH STREET TO BE CONNECTED WITH THE OLD CULVERT UNDER THE BASIN IN THE YEAR 1873 ANOTHER CULVERT WAS BUILT BY DIRECTION OF THE COUNCIL FROM SEVENTH AND CARY STREETS TO ELEVENTH AND CARY STREETS WHICH ALSO CONNECTED WITH THE OLD CULVERT IT THUS APPEARS THAT BY AUTHORITY OF THE COUNCIL THIS CULVERT WAS USED BY THE CITY AS THE SOLE OUTLET FOR ALL SEWAGE FROM THE LOCALITIES DRAINED BY THE TWO CULVERTS CONSTRUCTED IN 1836 AND IN 1873 UNTIL AFTER THE INJURY TO THE MILLS IN JULY 1898 IT FURTHER APPEARS THAT FOR THE USE OF THIS SYSTEM THE CITY EXACTED TOLLS AS IN CASE OF ITS OTHER SEWERS OTHER EVIDENCE OF ACCEPTANCE BY THE CITY OF RICHMOND OF THIS OLD CULVERT AS PART OF ITS SEWER SYSTEM WAS ADDUCED FROM THE RECORDS OF THE COUNCIL TO WHICH IT IS UNNECESSARY TO ALLUDE THE EVIDENCE TENDS TO SHOW THAT THE CULVERT ORIGINALLY RAN ACROSS THE PRESENT SITE OF THE GALLEGO MILLS BUT YEARS AGO LONG PRIOR TO THE ACQUISITION OF THE PROPERTY BY THE PRESENT OWNERS NEAR THE WESTERN WALL OF THE MILL BUILDING IT MADE A DETOUR AND RAN ALONG THE WEST ERN WALL OF THE MILL AS BEFORE DESCRIBED AND AFTER PASSING THE MILLS CROSSED UNDER CANAL STREET AND EMPTIED INTO THE TAIL RACE 800 JANRICHMOND V GALLEGO MILLS CO WHICH FLOWS INTO JAMES RIVER THE CULVERT FROM ELEVENTH AND CARY STREETS TO THE MILLS WAS A CIRCULAR BRICK CULVERT FROM THAT POINT TO ITS MOUTH IT IS A STONE BOX CULVERT THE INFERENCE FROM THAT CIR CUMSTANCE IS THAT THE LATTER SECTION OF IT WAS BUILT BY THE AUTHORITIES OF THE CITY IN THE YEAR 1833 IN PURSUANCE OF THE RESOLUTION OF THE CITY COUNCIL TO PREVENT ITS SOUTHERN EXTREMITY FROM BEING DAMMED BY THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE MILL BUT HOWEVER THAT MAY HAVE BEEN IT IS QUITE CERTAIN THAT THE SECTION OF CULVERT RE FERRED TO WAS NOT BUILT BY THE DEFENDANT IN ERROR UPON THE FOREGOING FACTS ON MOTION OF THE PLAINTIFF THE TRIAL COURT INSTRUCTED THE JURY THAT ALTHOUGH THEY BELIEVED FROM THE EVIDENCE THAT THE CULVERT PASSING UNDER THE BASIN EMBANKMENT WAS NOT BUILT BY THE CITY OF RICHMOND THEY ARE NEVERTHELESS INSTRUCTED THAT THE CITY OF RICHMOND BY THE RESOLUTIONS OF THE CITY COUNCIL PERMITTING THE LONG AND UNINTERRUPTED USE OF IT FOR THE FLOW OF WATER THROUGH IT FROM THE CITY SEWERS THEREBY ADOPTED IT AS A PART OF ITS SYSTEM OF SEWERS IN THAT SECTION OF THE CITY AND THE SAID CITY IS CHARGEABLE IN

PRINCIPLE DID NOT APPLY TO STREETS AND ALLEYS IN TOWN AS TO THEM THE ACTS OF THE CORPORATION OFFICERS MAY HAVE THE SAME EFFECT AS THE ACTS OF THE COUNTY COURT IT MAY BE SAFELY ASSUMED THAT IN THIS

PROPER OR AUTHORIZED LOCAL PUBLIC AUTHORITIES IT MAY BE EXPRESS AND APPEAR OF RECORD OR IT MAY BE IMPLIED FROM REPAIRS MADE AND ORDERED OR KNOWINGLY PAID FOR BY THE AUTHORITY WHICH HAS THE LEGAL POWER TO ADOPT THE STREET OR HIGHWAY OR FROM LONG USER BY THE PUBLIC THE PRESUMPTION OF ACCEPTANCE IS STRENGTHENED BY THE CIR CUMSTANCE THAT THE EASEMENT IS BENEFICIAL IN THIS CASE AS HAS BEEN SEEN THE TESTIMONY SHOWS AN ADVERSE UNINTERRUPTED AND EXCLUSIVE USER OF THE CULVERT BY THE CITY FOR MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY THAT IT HAD BEEN EXTENDED BY RESOLUTIONS OF THE COUNCIL THAT AN APPROPRIATION OF MONEY HAD BEEN MADE FOR ITS RE PAIR AND THAT IT WAS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE SEWER SYSTEM OF THE CITY AND A SOURCE OF PUBLIC REVENUE SO THAT UPON WELLSETTLED PRINCIPLES THE TITLE OF THE CITY TO THE

STREET OR ALLEY OR ANY SIDEWALK THEREOF AND MAY HAVE SHADE TREES PLANTED ALONG THE SAID STREETS THE FOREGOING PROVISION WAS NOT INTENDED TO RESTRICT THE POWER OF THE CITY IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF SEWERS

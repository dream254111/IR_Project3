pointed out and stood firmly to their ruling Then the legislature was appealed to and passed the act in question We have never had any doubt that the anticipated effect of the act was that any further suits upon disputed subscriptions would be effectually dis couraged and for the reason that by its terms courts of law in which actions under the decree making an assessment should be brought were given ex clusive jurisdiction to hear and determine all questions involving the validity of such subscriptionsthe manifest theory being that matters of fact inhering in such issues once gotten before a jury of defendants vicinage and the ad hominem arguments of hard times mistaken judgment heartless creditors the decree of a foreign court and it may be your turn next skillfully brought forwardto say nothing of the confusion and bewilder ment of issues which would necessarily have been incident to such a pro cedurethe result would not long be doubtful and the pursuit of the remedy would soon cease Ewempli gratia what a condition would have presented itself in the principal case had the defendants been allowed to go behind the decree and open up again to the jury the question of whether one of the claims in the chancery suit had or had not been reported by the commissioner to the credit of the wrong person This is only one of a num ber of questions that might have been precipitated upon the jury the only result being fog confusion and chaos The court construes that act con servatively as giving the courts of law jurisdiction to inquire into ques tions of fraud misrepresentation and the like in the original subscrip tion to the stock but declines to so read it as to make it do the vain and nugatory thing of authorizing each person affected to set at naught an issue already res judicata as to him We trust that the General Assembly will not again interfere in the matter by what is really special legislation for the relief of improvident investors but will leave it to the courts where all the relief to which these are entitled as against creditors who have parted with their money on the faith of these stock subscriptions and nothing else will be afforded them CITY OF

EASEMENTSAcceptance by cityHow evidencedPresumptionCase at bar A valid acceptance of an easement by a town does not require any distinct act of recognition by resolution of the corporate authorities of the town Acceptance will be presumed where it appears that the property has been set apart for the public use and the public has had exclusive uninterrupted and adverse use thereof for over twenty years and public and private rights have been acquired with reference to its use and enjoyment In the case at bar the city of Richmond has had adverse uninterrupted and exclusive use of a culvert as an essential part of its sewer system for over fifty years has extended it under resolutions of its council has appropriated money for its repair and has exacted money for the use of it as of other sewers It must therefore be regarded as city property 3 MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONSEasementsA ccfptanceRepairs The accept ance by a city of a culvert as a part of its sewer system renders the city liable

nor contributory negligence can be construed to run with the land Error to a judgment of the Law and Equity Court of the city of Richmond rendered in an action of trespass on the case wherein the defendant in error was the plaintiff and the plaintiff in error was the defendant Affirmed The opinion states the case 798 JanRICHMOND V GALLEGO MILLS CO Henry R Pollard for the plaintiff in error Coke  Pickrell Charles U Williams Leake  Carter and B Rand Wellford for the defendant in error WHITTLE J delivered the opinion of the court The gravamen of this action is damage to the property of the de fendant in error the Gallego Mills Company occasioned by the col lapse of a stone culvert extending along the western foundation wall of the mill building which culvert the declaration alleges it was the duty of the plaintiff in error the city of Richmond to maintain These mills are located at the eastern end of the basin of the old James River Company now with its appurtenances the property of the Chesapeake  Ohio Railway Company The western wall of the mill is separated from the basin by a wide open space known as the basin embankment Skirting that wall and between it and the embankment at the time of the injury complained of was an open area part of the mill premises one wall of which was the mill wall itself and the other a stout brick wall built into the em bankment This latter wall which is called in the evidence some times the area wall and sometimes the revetment wall is the dividing line between the property of the Gallego Mills Company and the basin embankment which latter is the property of the Chesa peake  Ohio Railway Company as successor in title through several mesne conveyances of the old James River Company Water to run the mills is drawn from the lower or eastern end of the basin and conveyed through a forebay or flume which passing through the basin embankment in front of the western wall of the mills crossed over the open area above referred to into the mills In thus crossing the area it was supported by the area or revetment wall and also by an arch spanning the area After the collapse of the culvert along the western wall of the mills the city of Richmond with knowledge of the broken ob structed and dangerous condition of the culvert at the point where it passed underneath the bottom of the area along the western wall of the mill and the foundations of the outward wall the area and the brick arch spanning the same neglected to repair the culvert and continued to use it for sewage purposes The effect of that neglect and user was to undermine the area wall and arch causing it to settle and causing the forebay or flume to break and give way 1904 7999 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER whereby a large volume of water flowed from the basin over the embankment and area into the mills seriously damaging the prop erty The mill occupies lot 361 in the plan of the city and the first mill was built upon it in the year of 1833 The lot as well as Twelfth and Canal streets is below the level of the old basin and on the Canal street side of it there was a deep ravine extending thence to James river Prior to the year 1833 the old culvert ran from near the corner of Eleventh and Cary streets across Basin street and that part of the basin embankment now occupied as the roadbed of the Chesapeake  Ohio Railway Company and emptied on lot 361 It does not clearly appear by whom this culvert was originally con structed but it does appear that for over 60 years it was in the open continuous and exclusive use of the city of Richmond In the year 1833 the common council of the city authorized the commissioners of streets to contract for the extension of the culvert so as to guard against its being dammed up at its southern extremity by the excavation of the foundations of the mill and the year fol lowing the commisioners were directed to contract for its further extension In the year 1836 the council adopted a resolution authorizing the construction of a new culvert up D or Cary street to Ninth street to be connected with the old culvert under the basin In the year 1873 another culvert was built by direction of the council from Seventh and Cary streets to Eleventh and Cary streets which also connected with the old culvert It thus appears that by authority of the council this culvert was used by the city as the sole outlet for all sewage from the localities drained by the two culverts constructed in 1836 and in 1873 until after the injury to the mills in July 1898 It further appears that for the use of this system the city exacted tolls as in case of its other sewers Other evidence of acceptance by the city of Richmond of this old culvert as part of its sewer system was adduced from the records of the council to which it is unnecessary to allude The evidence tends to show that the culvert originally ran across the present site of the Gallego Mills but years ago long prior to the acquisition of the property by the present owners near the western wall of the mill building it made a detour and ran along the west ern wall of the mill as before described and after passing the mills crossed under Canal street and emptied into the tail race 800 JanRICHMOND V GALLEGO MILLS CO which flows into James river The culvert from Eleventh and Cary streets to the mills was a circular brick culvert From that point to its mouth it is a stone box culvert The inference from that cir cumstance is that the latter section of it was built by the authorities of the city in the year 1833 in pursuance of the resolution of the city council to prevent its southern extremity from being dammed by the construction of the foundations of the mill But however that may have been it is quite certain that the section of culvert re ferred to was not built by the defendant in error Upon the foregoing facts on motion of the plaintiff the trial court instructed the jury that Although they believed from the evidence that the culvert passing under the basin embankment was not built by the city of Richmond they are nevertheless instructed that the city of Richmond by the resolutions of the city council permitting the long and uninterrupted use of it for the flow of water through it from the city sewers thereby adopted it as a part of its system of sewers in that section of the city and the said city is chargeable in respect to it with the same duties and responsi bilities as it would be if said culvert had been constructed by said city The giving of that instruction and the rejection of a compet ing instruction offered by the defendant constitute the first assign ment of error The defendants instruction is predicated upon the existence of a natural water course of sufficient volume to carry off all sewage passing therein from the city sewers flowing through the old cul vert along a natural bed or channel It is unnecessary to enter upon a discussion of the doctrine propounded by that instruction It was without evidence to sustain it and properly refused The instruction given at the instance of the plaintiff embodies the principle that the dedication and acceptance of an easement may be by grant or agreement express or implied The dedication and ac ceptance of an easement can be shown by proof of an express grant or agreement or by prescription requiring an uninterrupted enjoy ment or use immemorially or for 20 years to the extent of the ease ment claimed from which user a grant is implied That doctrine has been repeatedly enunciated and upheld by the decisions of this court Thus In Harris Case 20 Gratt 833 838 the court said The intent may be presumed from circumstances connected with a long and uninterrupted user by the public But such user is only im 1904 8019 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER portant as indicating a purpose to make the donation And this presumption may be rebutted by circumstances showing that an appropriation of the property to the use of the public is not in tended The opinion proceeds pages 839 840 In Kellys Case 8 Gratt 632 it was held with regard to county roads that there must be an acceptance by the county court upon its records but it was said this principle did not apply to streets and alleys in town As to them the acts of the corporation officers may have the same effect as the acts of the county court It may be safely assumed that in this state there may be a valid acceptance of an easement in a town without any distinct act of recognition by the corporate authorities of such town The mere user however by the public of the locus in quo will not of itself constitute an acceptance without regard to the character of the use and the circumstances and length of time under which it was claimed and enjoyed Where property in a town is set apart for public use and is enjoyed as such and private and public rights acquired with reference to it and to its enjoyment the law presumes such acceptance on the part of the public as will operate an estoppel i1 pais and preclude the owner from revoking the dedication In Dillon on Mun Cor sec 642 that author says There must be an acceptance of the dedication and this acceptance must be by the proper or authorized local public authorities It may be express and appear of record or it may be implied from repairs made and ordered or knowingly paid for by the authority which has the legal power to adopt the street or highway or from long user by the public The presumption of acceptance is strengthened by the cir cumstance that the easement is beneficial In this case as has been seen the testimony shows an adverse uninterrupted and exclusive user of the culvert by the city for more than half a century that it had been extended by resolutions of the council that an appropriation of money had been made for its re pair and that it was an essential part of the sewer system of the city and a source of public revenue So that upon wellsettled principles the title of the city to the culvert was as perfect as if that title had been acquired by express grant See City of Richmond v Stokes 31 Gratt 713 Chalkley v City of Richmond 88 Va 402 14 S E 339 29 Am St Rep 730 Buntin v City of Danville 93 Va 200 24 S E 830 City of Win chester v Carroll 99 Va 727 40 S E 37 802 Jan RICHMOND V GALLEGO MILLS CO In considering the doctrine of dedication and acceptance the fact should not be lost sight of that the public itself would be the chief loser by the adoption of a narrow restricted and illiberal inter pretation of the rules applicable to that subject The principle is founded in public convenience and has been sanctioned by long experience Indeed without such a principle it would be difficult if not impracticable for society to enjoy those ad vantages which belong to a state of advanced civilization and which are essential to its accommodation The importance of this doctrine may not always be appreciated but we are in a great degree depend ent on it for highways and streets and for the grounds appropriated as places of amusement or of public business which are found in all towns and especially in our populous cities Dillon on Mun Cor sec 627 The contention that the first instruction invaded the province of the jury in that it withdrew from their consideration the evidence upon which it was predicated is without merit The instruction merely told the jury that the legal effect of the resolutions adopted by the council of the city of Richmond the authenticity of which was not denied was an acceptance of the culvert and made the city responsible for its maintenance in the same manner and to the same extent as if it had been built by the city It was manifestly the province of the court and not of the jury to pass upon the effect of the resolutions in question There is no rule of law better established than that the con struction of a written instrument is a matter of law for the court which defines its terms its signification and legal effect from the language used and the context Proffatt on Jury Trial sec 300 Addington v Etheridge 12 Gratt 436 So in the case of mWashington etc R Co v Lacey 94 Va 460 26 S E 834 it was held As a general rule the construction of all written documents belongs to the court exclusively and it is not error to instruct a jury as to the proper construction of a city ordinance offered in evidence New River Mineral Co v Painter 100 Va 507 42 S E 300 Pettyjohn v National Exchange Bank 101 Va  43 S E 203 The case of Robinson v City of Danville Va 43 S E 337 is relied on as authority in this case by the city of Richmond The facts in the two cases are essentiallv different In that case the drain which existed prior to the building of the culvert under River 1904 8039 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER street originally brought down water from a spring and surface water but at the time of the injury complained of the water from the spring had sunk before it reached the culvert The city of Danville made no use of the drain to carry off either sewage or surface water The culvert was built by the authorities of North Danville not for the purpose of carrying off drainage from the town but to prevent a natural drain from being stopped by it in raising the grade of River street The culvert was obstructed by the Riverside Cotton Mills on whose lot it emptied and not by the city of Danville The second subdivision of the first assignment of error is because the city of Richmond had no power to construct or maintain sewers outside of its streets alleys or public places The provision of the charter relied on to sustain that contention is as follows They the council may build bridges in and culverts under said streets and may prevent or remove any structure obstruction or encroach ment over or under or in a street or alley or any sidewalk thereof and may have shade trees planted along the said streets The foregoing provision was not intended to restrict the power of the city in the construction of sewers but rather to increase the servitude that ordinarily attaches to a right of way by authorizing the city in addition to its right of way over its streets and alleys to exercise the other privileges specified Every municipal corporation has the power to purchase and hold all the real estate reasonably necessary to the proper exercise and enjoyment of the powers conferred upon it or essential to the pur poses for which it was created Richmond etc Co v Wlest Point 94 Va 668 27 S E 460 The right to provide for the drainage of streets and to construct and repair sewers is generally granted to cities in express terms by their charters or by the statute governing their incorporation but without any express grant of such authority the right to exercise it is regarded as incident to the general power to maintain and control streets The authority of the municipality as to such matters may extend even beyond the city limits and unless prohibited by charter or statute the city has inherent power to contract for and construct works beyond the corporate limits for the discharge of sewage when the same is necessary Elliott on Roads  Streets 2d Ed sec 468 1 Dillon on Mun Corp 3d Ed sec 89 If therefore the old culvert was a necessary outlet for sewage 804 JanRICHMOND V GALLEGO MILLS CO for that section of the city which is not denied it was competent for the city to have acquired it either by express or implied grant Kranz v Mayor of Baltimore 64 Md 491 2 Atl 908 Stoddard v Village of Saratoga Springs 127 N Y 261 27 N E 1030 Leeds v City of Richmond 102 Ind 372 1 N E 711 Coldwater v Tucker 36 Mich 474 24 Am Rep 601 The second assignment of error is to the refusal of the court to grant instruction 4 asked for by the city of Richmond That instruction told the jury that if they belived from the evi dence that the embankment over the sewer was made by some cor poration other than the city and that the primary cause of the overflow complained of was the imperfect construction of the said bank or its improper or careless maintenance by such corporation or its assignees the jury should find for the defendant The contention of the city in that regard is that by covenants and agreements between the James River Company and remote grantors of the plaintiff grantees from that company it became the duty of the plaintiff to keep in repair the embankment in front of the Gallego Mills the property of the Chesapeake  Ohio Railway Company The covenant relied on has been carefully scrutinized It im poses no duty on the covenantor to keep in repair the embankment but stipulates that he shall not damage it and the works of the James River Company and mainly had reference to the original construction of the forebay or flume through which the water from the basin is carried over the embankment to the machinery of the mill If the injury to plaintiffs property was due to the concurring negligence of the Chesapeake  Ohio Railway Company and the city of Richmond either or both could be held liable Therefore an instruction which told the jury that the city was not responsible was erroneous and properly refused Riverside Cotton Mills v Lanier decided at the present term 45 S E 875 The two remaining assignments of error may be considered to gether The plaintiff in error complains of the refusal of the court to give instructions 9 and 11 which are as follows 9 Though the jury believe from the evidence that the sewer in the declaration mentioned the defective condition of which is alleged to have caused the damage complained of had been used or controlled by the city of Richmond so as to become one of its works yet if they believe from the evidence that the said sewer was located 1904 8059 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER on the property of the Gallego Mills Company and further believe that the plaintiff or those under whom the plaintiff claims took control of the said sewer without the consent of the city and changed in part the location thereof and reconstructed a large portion thereof or otherwise dealt with it as its own then the plain tiff is estopped from claiming in this suit the said sewer was the sewer of the city of Richmond and they the jury should find for the defendant 11 Though the jury believe from the evidence that the sewer in the declaration mentioned the defective condition of which is alleged to have caused the damage complained of had been used or controlled by the city of Richmond so as to become one of its works yet if they believe from the evidence that the said sewer was located on the property of the Gallego Mills Company and further believe that the plaintiff or those under whom the plaintiff claims took control of the said sewer without consent of the city and changed in part the location thereof and reconstructed a large portion thereof or otherwise dealt with it as its own and if they further be lieve that the defect or imperfect condition of the sewer complained of in the declaration which caused the damage to the plaintiffs property occurred on that portion of the sewer built or constructed by the plaintiff or those under whom the plaintiff claims and from whom it derives its title and further believe that such defect or im perfect construction was the primary cause of the collapse of the said sewer and damage to the plaintiffs property then the plaintiff is chargeable with contributory negligence and is not entitled to re cover in this case In respect to these instructions it may be remarked that there was no evidence to sustain the hypothetical case upon which they are based and correct practice forbids the giving of an instruction upon an abstract proposition of law or where there is no evidence to support it Kimball v Borden 95 Va 203 28 S E 207 Reeds Case 98 Va 817 36 S E 399 The Gallego Mills Company acquired the property in the year 1895 and it is not pretended that it ever took control of the sewer or changed its location or constructed any part of it The conten tion that the acts of some former owner of the property can estop the present owner from claiming compensation for injuries to his property resulting from a failure of the city to maintain its sewer and keep it in a reasonably safe condition or that such acts of a 806 Jan1904 RICHMOND TRACTION COMPANY V MARTIN former owner as those contemplated in the instructions can be con strued as contributory negligence of the present owner is not sus tained either by reason or authority It is the duty of a city from the time it acquires a sewer to maintain it in a reasonably proper condition without regard to what may have been the attitude of a former owner of the land through which it passes with respect to it In the absence of some covenant in the chain of title to that effect neither estoppel nor con tributory negligence can be construed to run with the land The instructions were therefore properly rejected upon two grounds 1 That there was no evidence to sustain them as to the plaintiff and 2 that the proposition of law embodied in them is unsound so far as applied to the acts of former owners of the property Upon the whole case the judgment complained of is without error and is affirmed Affirmed RICHMOND TRACTION COMPANY V MARTINS ADMINISTRATOR Supreme Court of Appeals At Richmond December 9 1903 Absent Buchanan 4t 1 INSTRUCTIONSDifferent theories of caseEvidence to

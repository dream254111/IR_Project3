LHUYDS ARCHAEOLOGIA BRITANNICA OR GLOSSOGRAPHY AND AM BOLD TO SAY THAT NOTHING IN THIS KIND HAS APPEARED IN PUBLICK WITHIN MY KNOWLEDGE THIS CENTURY TO BE COMPARED UNTO IT WHETHER WE CONSIDER THE ELABORATENESS OF THE WORK THE2439 THE SKILL AND JUDGMENT OF THE COMPILER OR THE USEFULNESS OF IT TO ILLUSTRATE THE MOST ANCIENT PART OF OUR HISTORY AND TRACE OUT THE ORIGINAL INHABITANTS AND BRIGANTIC AND BELGIC COLONIES SIMILITUDE OF LANGUAGES AND OF RITES AND RELIGIOUS OPINIONS BEING BY THAT GREAT AUTHOR OF HISTORIOGRAPHY HERODOTUS HALICARNASSENSIS DESERVEDLY AC COUNTED THE MOST ESTABLISHED RULES FOR SUCH DISCOVERIES THE INGENIOUS AND LEARNED AUTHOR HAS VERY CANDIDLY AND TRULY REPRESENTED HIS OWN UNDERTAKING IN HIS ENGLISH PRE FACE AND IN THAT CURIOUS LETTER WRITTEN TO MY LORD BI SHOP OF HEREFORD TO WHICH I REFER YOU IN HIS BRITISH EPISTLE TO HIS OWN COUNTRYMEN HE DELIVERS HIS VERY WEIGHTY REASONS FOR ALTERING THE VULGAR ALPHABET OF THE WELSH AND JUSTIFIES IT FROM THE AUTHORITY OF ANCIENT M S S AND INSCRIPTIONS UPON STONES IN SEVERAL PARTS OS OUR COUNTRY NEXT HE LEARNEDLY REFUTES THE OPINION OF THE SAXONS RECEIVING THEIR ALPHABET FROM AUSTIN THE MONK AND SHEWS THAT THE SAME CHARACTERS ARE STILL EXTANT ON THE TOMBSTONE OF KADVAN KING OF GUYNEDH IN THE CHURCH CALLD LHAN GADWALADAR IN THE ISLE OF ANGLESEY WHO WAS ONE OF THE BRITISH PRINCES IN THAT FAMOUS BATTLE OF BAN GOR IS Y COED FOUGHT AGAINST THOSE SAXONS WHOM AUSTIN HAD INFLUENCED TO MASSACRE THE BRITISH MONKSINDEED ALL THE SEPULCHRAL INSCRIPTIONS IN MR CAMDENS BRITANIA ABUNDANT LY PROVE THE USE OF THE ROMAN ALPHABET IN THIS NOBLE PROVINCE FROM WHENCE THE ANCIENT BRITISH OR AS NOW COMMONLY CALLD SAXON AND IRISH ALPHABETS ARE VERY SMALL DEVIATIONS UNAVOIDLY INTRODUCED BY TIME AND THE ARBITRARY USE OF WRITING WHAT HE NEXT PROCEEDS TO SEEMS MUCH MORE OWING TO HIS MODESTY THAN OF ANY REAL NECESSITY I MEAN HIS EXCUSING THE TIME HE EMPLOYD IN THIS GREAT UNDERTAKING FOR THAT MAY WELL SEEM TO ANY JUDICIOUS AND IMPARTIAL PERUSER TO HAVE RATHER BEEN THE PRODUCT OF AN AGE THAN OF THOSE FEW YEARS SINCE HIS RE TURN FROM HIS TRAVELS WHAT HE SAYS FOR PUTTING THOSE FOUR LANGUAGES INTO ONE BOOK IS VERY REASONABLE IN RE GARD2440 GARD NONE OF THESE VERY ANTIENT DIALECTS CAN BE ADJUSTED BUT BY BEING COMPARED WITH THE OTHERS THE SCOTISH LANGUAGE WHICH BY A LARGE LIST OF WORDS IN THE BASQUE AND IRISH IS HERE SUFFICIENTLY DEMONSTRATED TO BE A BRANCH OF THE OLD SPANISH HE SHEWS TO BE INTERMIXT WITH THE ANCIENT GWYDHELEG OR BRITISHIRISH AS ALSO THAT THESE GWYDHELIANS WERE THE MOST ANCIENT COLONIES OF GALLS HEREAND PROBABLY FORCED BY THE ANCESTORS OF THE BRITANS INTO SCOTLAND AND IRELAND THE PICTS BEING BY THE BRITISH WRITERS TERMD GUYDHYL FICHTIED AND IRISH WORDS SUCH AS UYSLG BAN LHUCH DRIM C STILL CONTINUING TO BE NAMES OF BRITISH RIVERS AND MOUNTAINS AS ALSO NUM BE S OF WORDS SUCH AS CORLAN BLITH AND THE LIKE IN THE PRESENT BRITISH WHOSE ETYMOLOGIES ARE ONLY FOUND IN THE GUYDHELIAN OR IRISH DIALECT NOW DISGUISED BY THE SCOTIC THIS GUYDHELIAN TONGUE HE LEARNEDLY PROVES FROM ANCIENT CELTIC WORDS AND NAMES OF PLACES IN THE ROMAN GEOGRAPHY TO HAVE BEEN ALSO THE LANGUAGE OF GAUL FOR MY OWN PART I MUST CONFESS I LOOK UPON OUR BRITISH THE ORIGIN WHEREOF HE DEFERS TILL ANOTHER OCCASION TO BE A BRANCH OF THAT ANTIENT BELGIC THAT WAS SPOKEN BY THE GALLI SENONES WHO POSSESSD ALL THE LOWER PARTS OF GERMANY UNTIL THE INVASION OF THE KIMERIAN SAXONS OR KIMBRIANS FROM THE PALUS MAEOTIS WHENCE OUR CELTOSCYTHAE OR PRESENT GERMANS OF WHICH SEE POSSIDO NIUS IN STRABO LASTLY HE DOES NOT ONLY PROVE BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE TRIADES A SMALL BRITISH TRACT WRITTEN ACCORDING TO THE JUDGMENT OF THAT MOST LEARNED ANTI QUARY MR ROBERT VAUGHAN OF HENGURT ABOUT A THOUSAND YEARS AGO THAT THERE WAS A VERY NUMEROUS COLONY MADE IN VERY EARLY TIMES OUT OF GREAT BRITAIN INTO VASCONIA BUT ALSO CONFIRMS BY A LARGE CATALOGUE OF BRITISH WORDS IN THE PRESENT GASGOIN THE MIXTURE OF BOTH PEOPLE EVEN THERE AS WELL AS IN IRELAND HIS COMPARATIVE ETYMOLOGY IS SO METHODICALLY ARTFULLY AND JUDICIOUSLY DIGESTED SO ADMIRABLY PROJECTED BY THE BEST CANONS AS WELL OF CRITIQUE2441 CRITIQUE AS OF GRAMMAR THAT IT RECOMMENDS ITS SELF PRIMA FACIE TO THE NICEST PALATE AND SUFFICIENTLY PROVIDES IT SELF AGAINST DISINGENUOUS CAVILLERS HIS HARMONICON IN LATIN BRITISH AND IRISH IS A NOBLE PROMPTUARIUM OF ALL THE BRITISH DIALECTS A WORK OF MUCH LABOUR AND JUDGMENT AND WHICH CANNOT BUT BE ACCEPTABLE TO THE CURIOUS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES IT WERE INDEED TO BE WISHD THE WHOLE WERE TRANSLATED INTO LATIN SCHOLARS ABROAD HAVING GENERALLY A GREATER CURIOSITY THIS WAY THAN AS YET WE SEEM TO HAVE IN ENGLAND FATHER JULIAN MANIORS ARMORIC GRAMMAR IS A VALUABLE CURIOSITY AND ILLUSTRATES THE WORK IT HA VING SCARCE BEEN EVER HEARD OF IN OUR COUNTRY AND THE ARMORIC DICTIONARY ADDED TO IT SUPPLIES IN A GREAT MEA SURE THE DEFECT OF THE CORNISH ONE PROMISED IN THE NEXT VOLUME IN THE CORNISH GRAMMAR OUR JUDICIOUS AUTHOR SEEMS TO EXCEL HIMSELF YOU HAVE THERE THE HISTORY OF OUR BRITISH ALPHABETS NICELY AND ACCURATELY HANDLED WITH A VERY CURIOUS AND DIVERTING VARIETY OF THINGS YOU HAVE ALSO A CONSIDERABLE SUPPLEMENT TO DR DAVIESS LEARNED DICTIONARY HE HAS INFINITELY OBLIGED THE ANCIENT BRITANS OF CORNWAL BY PRESERVING THEIR LANGUAGE TO POSTERITY WHEN JUST EXPIRING I CANNOT OMIT SAYING THUS MUCH OF THAT NOBLE DIALECT OF THE BRITISH THAT IT APPEARS AS CA PABLE OF ARTFUL MANAGEMENT AND GRAMMAR RULES AS THE MOST REFINED LANGUAGES INDEED THE CELTIC TONGUES IN GENERAL SEEM TO HAVE BEEN VERY ANCIENTLY REFINED AND I QUESTION NOT THE TRUTH OF WHAT IS HINTED IN THAT INCOMPA RABLE LETTER OF OUR AUTHOR TO THE LORD BISHOP OF HEREFORD THAT THEY WERE THE VERY GROUNDWORK OF GREEK AND LATIN GRAMMARS NOT ONLY THE CANTABRIAN OR SCOTIC PART OF OUR IRISH BUT EVEN THE NOBLE TEUTONIC DIALECTS THEMSELVES SO LEARNEDLY RECOMMENDED BY THE INCOMPARABLE DR HICKS IN HIS LATE THESAURUS SEEMING BUT DEFECTIVE IF COMPARD AS TO ART AND VARIETY WITH OUR BRITISH THE LEARNED WORLD WILL THEREFORE THE LESS WONDER IF FATHER MOLLOY WAS ABLE TO PERFORM SO LITTLE OF THE GRAMMARIANS PART 15 B IN2442 IN HIS IRISH GRAMMAR THE DECLENSIONS OF NOUNS AND PRONOUS I MUST OWN TO BE MOSTLY UPON THE BRITISH PLAN BUT THE VERB WHICH IS THE GROUNDWORK OR BASIS OF EVE RY REGULAR TONGUE SEEMS AS IN ALL UNCULTIVATED LANGUA GES WILD AND UNACCOUNTABLE IN THE CATALOGUE OF BRITISH M S S OUR AUTHOR HAS CONSULTED THE READERS TIME BY COMPOSING IT IN THE ORDER OF ALPHABET WITH ABBREVIATI ONS DIRECTING TO THE STUDIES WHERE THEY MAY BE SEEN AT PRESENT AND ALSO HIS ADVANTAGE BY DISTINGUISHING ALWAYS BETWIXT TRACTS AND SINGLE PAPERS AND BETWIXT PERFECT TREA TISES AND IMPERFECT GIVING A MORE PARTICULAR ACCOUNT OF SUCH PIECES AS SEEM TO DESERVE IT AND DISMISSING THE USE LESS POETS OF THE TWO LAST CENTURIES WITH ONLY THE BARE MENTIONING THEM NOR HAS HE SHEWD MORE INDUSTRY AND JUDGMENT IN THIS AND THE OTHER TITLES OF THIS WORK THAN HAS BEEN FOR THE EXTENT OF IT SUCCESSFULLY IMITATED BY HIS INGENIOUS FELLOWTRAVELLER MR PARRY IN HIS EXCELLENT ESSAY TOWARDS A BRITISH ETYMOLOGICON WHERE HE HAS MO DESTLY PARALLELLD THE GREATEST PART OF THE BRITISH RADICALS WITH THOSE WORDS THAT SEEMD AGREEABLE THEREWITH IN ANY OTHER LANGUAGE WITHOUT PRETENDING TO DETERMINE THE POINT OF PRECEDENCY AS TO ANTIQUITY WHICH HAS BEEN TOO MUCH THE BOLDNESS OF THE LATE LEARNED MONSIEUR PEZRON AND INDEED OF MOST OTHER ETYMOLOGISTS THE IRISH FOCLOIR OR DICTIONARY SO INDUSTRIOUSLY COMPILED BY OUR LEARNED ANTIQUARY AND SUPPLYD WITH A LARGE APPENDIX OF OMIT TED WORDS FROM SCOTLAND AND IRELAND CANNOT BESIDES THE GREAT SERVICE IT MUST NEEDS CONTRIBUTE TO THE INHABITANTS OF THOSE COUNTRIES BUT BE JUDGED OF CONSIDERABLE USE TO CRITICKS IN THE BRITISH AND CELTIC THE GUYDHELIAN PART OF THAT LANGUAGE BEING THAT WHICH WAS SPOKEN BY THE MOST ANCIENT COLONY OF THE CELTS IN THIS ILAND AND CONSE QUENTLY CONTAINING THE ETYMOLOGIES OF VAST NUMBERS OF BRITISH DERIVATIONS AND COMPOUNDS OTHERWISE NOT TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR THE2443 THE SINGULAR GENEROSITY OF THOSE AMONST THE NOBILITY AND GENTRY WHO HAVE SO LIBERALLY CONTRIBUTED TO THE EX PENCES OF THE AUTHORS TRAVELS IN ORDER TO QUALIFIE HIM FOR SO UNCOMMON AN UNDERTAKING HAS AS YOU KNOW VE RY WELL BESIDES THEIR NAMES PREFIXD TO THIS VOLUME BEEN GRATEFULLY ACKNOWLEDGD IN THE PREFACE OF A LATIN BOOK PUBLISHD DURING HIS TRAVELS NOR CAN INDEED SO LAUDA BLE AN ACT BE EVER TOO MUCH CELEBRATED THERE BEING NO OTHER METHOD OF RENDERING ONE CAPABLE OF SUCH A TASK BUT THOSE TRAVELS THROUGH THE REMOTEST PARTS OF BRITAIN AND IRELAND WHICH HE HAS UPON THAT ENCOURAGEMENT SO SUCCESSFULLY PERFORMD ONE WOULD THINK THAT IN THIS LEARNED AND CURIOUS AGE NOTHING NEED BE URGD AS TO THE USEFULNESS OF PRESERVING IN WRITING THESE ORIGINAL LANGUAGES OF BRITAIN AND IRE LAND BUT YET SO SUBJECT IS HUMANE NATURE TO PREJUDICE AND SO APT TO ENTERTAIN THE EASIE HUMOUR OF JESTING RA THER THAN THAT MORE THOUGHTFUL ONE OF CONSIDERING SUB JECTS AND EXAMINING THEM THAT I FIND A GREAT MANY GENTLEMEN OTHERWISE VERY SENSIBLE AND INGENIOUS ARE AT A LOSS HEREIN THE USE OF COMMITTING TO WRITING THESE NOW ALMOST ANTIQUATED LANGUAGES IS WHAT THE AUTHOR HAS TRULY HINTED IN HIS DEDICATION AND PREFACES NAME LY THE TRACING OUT OF THE ORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF THESE PARTS OF EUROPE THE INTERPRETATION OF THE NAMES OF PERSONS AND PLACES IN THE ROMAN HISTORY AND GEOGRAPHY NOT ONLY OF GAUL BRITAIN AND IRELAND BUT IN A GREAT MEASURE ALSO OF ITALY AND SPAIN THE IMPROVEMENT OF SUCH WORKS OF LEARNED AND DESERVEDLY EMINENT MEN AS THE ETYMOLOGICAL DICTIONARIES OF VOSSIUS AND MENAGE THE EXPLAINING SUCH PASSAGES IN THE GREEK AND LATIN WRITERS AS RELATE TO THE RITES AND MANNERS OF THE GAULS BRITAINS C BY A DILIGENT PERUSAL OF THE ANCIENT POETS AND SUCH OTHERS OF THE OLDEST WRITERS AS ARE EXTANT IN THESE LAN GUAGES AS FOR SUCH AS SHALL ANSWER THAT THO ALL THIS SHOULD BE GRANTED YET STILL THESE ARE BUT TRIFLING AND USE LESS2444 LESS DISQUISITIONS TIS PLAIN THEY SPEAK SO UNLIKE SCHOLARS AS NOT TO REQUIRE ANY FURTHER REPLY I CANNOT CONCLUDE WITHOUT TAKING NOTICE OF ONE CA LUMNY THAT HAS BEEN WHISPERD ABOUT BY MEN OF PASSION OR INTREAGUE VIZ THAT THIS BOOK IS DESIGND TO SERVE A CERTAIN INTEREST I THEREFORE THINK MY SELF OBLIGD IN JU STICE TO CERTIFIE TO THE PUBLICK THAT AFTER A CAREFUL PERU SAL OF ALL THE PARTS OF THIS WORK I CANNOT DISCERN A SYL LABLE ANY WHERE THAT IN THE LEAST TENDS TO FAVOUR ANY PARTY OR IS ANY WAY CONCERND IN ANY NATIONAL DISTINCTI ON AND THAT THE AUTHOR EVERY WHERE DISCOVERS HIMSELF A MAN OF CANDOR AND ABOVE PARTIALITY I HAVE NOT I CONFESS HAD THE HAPPINCSS OF A PERSONAL ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIM BUT I PRESUME I MAY AS OUR BLESSED SAVIOUR DIRECTS JUDGE OF A TREE BY ITS FRUIT L O N D O N PRINTED FOR

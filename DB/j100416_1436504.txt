identification has been confirmed by Mr J T Nichols The largest fish a female approximated seven feet while the smaller a male accurately measured was 6 feet 4 inches This appears to be the second record of this species for Long Island and is therefore worthy of note About September 1 I examined four other sharks of this same species at Montauk Point where they had been taken by fishermen some days before WILLIAM T HFETMUTH Easthampton New York GROUND SHARKS A CORRECTION In COPEIA No 35 p 70 second paragraph for only 7 were males read only 8 were males In the last line of same paragraph

AND BEHAVIOR OF THE TEXAS HORNED LIZARD Phrynosoma cornutum Harlan I Unlike the desert species of the genus these forms are far more active in the middle of the fore noon than during the hottest part of the day which lasts from about noon to the middle of the afternoon In the forenoon Phrynosomas are actively feeding and the collector finds them readily Their favorite haunt seems to be along the edge of thick vegetation In such a place during the feeding hour they may be seen running rapidly up and dQwn often passing each other and snatching with their viscid tongues any insects which emerge into the open The next most likely spot is in the thick vegetation near some ant road 81COPE1A While burrowing deeply in the winter it appears that the Texas horned lizards do not bury themselves at night as do most of the desert species Nor do they do so in rainy weather or during brief cold snaps At such times they retire into the burrows of rodents or under flat rocks It is an interesting fact that at such times horned lizards are very abun dant under the cross ties of railroad tracks Often they burrow through into the area between the two rails Here they emerge and are literally trapped The rails are usually too high to be climbed over and the lizards run up and down frantically occasionally one climbs up on a rail just in time to be crushed by a passing train Many live for the rest of the summer in this uncomfortable pasture In the area of their greatest abundance horned lizards first appear from their winter burrows about the middle of April At this time they are markedly grouped into two sizes one the full adult size aver aging about 125 mm and the other the half sized averaging about 50mm from the hatching of the previous autumn From this it seems clear that these lizards do not reach full size until the end of their first year Some specimens go through an incomplete moulting at the time of their emergence from hiberna tion but the most important moult takes place during the first two weeks of July It is during this time that the blood ejecting habit is most conspicuous The extraordinary habit of occasionally squirting blood from the eye when attacked has been observed and recorded by a number of writers Hay supposed that it was a mode of protection during moulting Bryant speaking of the California species says that blood ejecting is just as liable to occur between moults as during moult Bryant sectioned the eye lids of a blood ejecting specimen but could find noth ing except that the lids were rather swollen and vascu lar Several writers have suggested that the blood ejecting is due to the weakening of a portion of theCOPEIA cornea by some parasiteperhaps one of the mites which so commonly infest these lizards The writer has recorded elsewhere Science Vol XL 78485 a very careful examination which he made of several blood squirting specimens HIe found no parasites of any kind and expressed the belief that the blood ejecting in this species at least is intimately con nected with moulting Since this study was pub lished the writer has found seven more blood ejecting specimens and all were moulting In feeding small insects are clearly preferred but sometimes a venturesome individual will swallow a large grasshopper or even a snail The writer once watched one of these animals eating a large brown May beetle The beetle lumbered before the eyes of the lizard The reptile slowly turned his head a little to one side and watched the insect then raised him self high on his legs and snatched at the insect with his tongue whipping it against his lips but not bring ing it into his mouth The lizard hastily jumped back and puffed himself out in the usual warning atti tude of these animals The beetle began to crawl away The lizard returned to the attack carefully stalking his prey for a yard or so then rushing on it seized it in his mouth without using his sticky tongue After turning it about against the ground the lizard finally gulped the insect down The writer expected to see the lizard use its front feet as the common toad does when handling a large mouthful but although the front feet were waved alternately in the air they were not used Mention has been made before of the reaction of these lizards toward various animals When at tacked the lizard puffs itself out into an almost flat shape tucks the head down exposing the horns and waits for the enemy The habit of charging on an enemy which has been mentioned may be more com mon than is suspected although the writer has ob 83COPEIA served it only once Specimens seldom attempt to bite the collector Bryant discovered that the California species of horned lizards are very subject to a form of hypno tism The writer has confirmed this on the Texas form also Bryants method is to stroke the animal between the eyes After three or four gentle strokes the lizard closes its eves and becomes very quiet even losing some of the reflexes The writer has discovered that if the region over the pineal eye is simply touched a few times with the tip of the finger that the hyp notic effect can be induced He has further found that if after a time when the animal begins to show signs of awakening if gentle passes are made in the air over the region of the pineal eye the animal will return to the hypnotic condition So far he has not been able to find a definite explanation of this but it would seem to suggest that the pineal eye in these animals may be more or less functional W M WINTON Fort Worth Texas Edited by J T NICHOLS American Museum of

j101009,The Virginia Law Register,1103835,In the Circuit Court of Pulaski County Virginia Martha J Bond v Mitchell Bond,i245997,BOND V BOND IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF PULASKI COUNTY VIRGINIA MARTHA J BOND V MIITCIIELL BOND CurtesyRequisitesBirth of IssueLegitimated ChildA child born out of wedlock but afterwards legitimated by virtue of  2553 of the Virginia Code of 1904 namely by the subsequent marriage of the parents and recognition of the child by them is not a sufficient compliance w ith the comimonlaw requisite that to entitle the hug band to an estate by the curtesy in the wifes lands issue must be born alive during the coverture TIORNTON L MASSIE J The sole question presented for de cision in this case is whether the defendant Mitchell Bond is entitled to an estate by the curtesy in the lands described in the bill No question is raised as to the form of the proceedings and no demurrer is interposed to the bill but by consent of parties the court is asked to tlecide the only question presented for de cision viz Has the defendant Mitchell Bond an estate by the curtesy in the lands of which his wife Martha Bond died seized and possessed The agreed facts in the case are as follows Nancy Johnson inherited from her mother Martha Johnson about seventyfive acres of land situate in Pulaski County Nancy Johnson had two illegitimate children before her marriage with Mitchell Bond the defendant in this case One of these children the daughter of Mitchell Bond died under twentyone and with out issue The other Martha J Bond who was not the child of Mitchell Bond is the plaintiff in this case Nancy Johnson Bonl her mother died in December 1907 in possession of the lanls in controversy leaving surviving her her husband Mitchell Bond and her daughter Martha J Bond the plaintiff It is ad mitted that the child who died was an illegitimate child of Nancy Bend and the defendant Mitchell Bond and was born before the marriage of these parties which took place in March 1876 and that Mitchell Bond the father after their marriage recognized her as being his child It is further admitted that all the requisites for an estate by the curtesy in the land exist except one viz issue born alive during the coverture As to this the plaintiff insists that this 1910 41116 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER requisite not existing curtesy must be denied whilst defendant insists that the child being legitimated by virtue of Sec 2553 Va Code 1904 she is to be considered as born in lawful wedlock It is also admitted that defendant is in possession of title papers to which the plaintiff is entitled if curtesy is denied Section 2553 is as follows If a man having a child or children by a woman shall afterwards intermarry with her such child or children and their descendants if recognized by him before or after marriage shall be deemed legitimate It is true that the illegitimate child was legitimated under this statute and was given all the rights of inheritance that she would have possessed had she been born in lawful wedlock but can it be sail that the effect of the statute is to enlarge the estate by the curtesy and give it where it was not allowed before It is well settled that the child must be born luring coverture and so rigidly is this rule adhered to that if the wife die in childbirth and the child is after her death by a Caesarean sec tion ripped from the womb alive no curtesv is allowed The fact that the child is en vcentrc sa mtere at the time of the wifes death while reckoned by the law sufficiently in being to enable the child itself to take an estatc for its ownc benefit will not suffice to confer rights upon third persons Minor on Real Property vol 1 p 283 Under the common law a bastard was of kin to no one filius nullius or as sometimes called filius populi and was therefore incapable of being the heir of any person The rule of the Civil law was much more humane and just and enabled the father of an illegitimate child to make some reparation to his unfortunate offspring by securing to the innocent unfortunate the rights of inheritance to which it is naturally entitled The lawmaking power can declare a chid born to be legiti mate or illegitimate and it is only that power that fixes and de termines the status of children born If born before marriage the legislature can remove the disability of this illegitimacy and by its transcendent power can legitimize and make capable of inheriting the illegitimate child Miller v Miller N Y 43 Am Rep 671 4 Blackstones Com 36 412 OctMost of the states have now passed statutes similar to our statute legitimating illegitimate children under similar circum stances but in doing so the legislatures were conferring rights upon the child and not upon the parent they were putting it in the power of the putative parent to in part make reparation for his misconduct by conferring upon the innocent illegitimate the right of inheritance This is all that can be done the sting of il legitimacy may be softened but not removed either by the parent or the lawmaking power save and unless it had been decreed that such licentious relations constituted a valid marriage That this statute Sec 2553 does not have such effect cannot be de nied nor are common law marriages valid in Virginia Offield v Davis 100 Va 250 If the plain purpose of  2553 was to legitimate fruits of il licit connections and if this section does not declare that such re lations constitute a valid marriage how can it be claimed with any degree of reason that the effect of the statute is to make such issue issue born during coverture when in fact he was not born during coverture In the case of Miller v Miller supra the judge in passing upon the effect of the Bastard Act of one state upon parties domiciled elsewhere on page 671 holds that there is a marked difference between the words legitimate and born in lawful wedlock In that case the famous case of Bertwhistle v Vordell 11 E C L 266 is discussed In the latter case it appears that by the law of Scotland a marriage legitimates a child but the court held that such a child could not inherit land in England because under the English Statute of Merton 20 Hen 3 chap 9 it is not only required that a child in order to inherit must be legitimate but should be born in lawful wedlock as well That there is a difference between the word legitimate as used in such a statute and the words born in lawful wedlock This decision has been much criticised it appears because the law of Scotland was not followed but not on account of the distinction made between the words legitimate and born in lawful wed lock The case of Murdock v Murdock N H 65 Atlantic Rep 1910 413 BOND Z BOND16 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER 392 is somewhat analogous It appears from the case that there is a statute providing for the adoption of children That statute is not quoted in the decision but as a matter of fact it provides that an adopted child should bear the same relations to the adopting parents and their kindred in respect to the inheritance of property and all other incidents pertaining to the relation of par ent and child as he would have if he were the natural child of such parents etc The adopting father claimed that such child was issue born during coverture and that he therefore was entitled to curtesy under the common law but the court held he was not entitled to such an estate and further states that al though the fact that their adopted child takes more and he less than if she were their own child may have some tendency to prove that he ought to have such an estate it has no tendency to prove that the legislature intended to give it to him for he takes the same share of his wifes estate that he would have taken if they had not adopted Carrie Section 2286a Code of Vir ginia 1904 provides that curtesy shall be allowed when the commonlaw requisites therefor exist and as stated one of these requisites is that there shall be issue born alive luring coverture Section 2553 is dealing with the rights of the child it does not expressly or by necessary implication enlarge the es tate by the curtesy If the legislature had intended to do tliis it would have provided that the husband would be entitled to curtesy under the circumstances mentioned in the statute the declaration that the child should be legitimate could net have the effect of repealing the plain mandate of  2286a The legisla ture was legitimatizing the child that is conferring upon him the right of inheritance Legitimation may be defined to be the investment of an il legitimate or one supposed to be the issue of an illegal marriage with the rights of one born in lawful wedlock 3 Am  Eng Enrc Law 895 Legitimation of bastards either by subsequent marriage or by an act of the government is nothing but a legal equalization of certain children illegitimately begotten with legitimate children Bar Int Law 434 quoted in 3 Am  Eng Enc Law 895 note 414 OctAgainst the view herein taken the case of Hunter v Whit worth 9 Ala 695 is cited This case is apparently an authority for the position contended for by the defendant It appears from the case that there was in Alabama a statute similar to the Vir ginia Statute legitimating bastards The decision holds that the husband may by a kind of legal fiction pro re nata be presumed to have married previous to the birth of the child because marriage is the source of all legitimacy The persuasive value of this decision is much lessened by the fact that there was another statute in Alabama which provided that if the mother of the child and the imputed father shall at any time after its birth in termarry the child shall in all respects be deemed and held legiti mate conformably to the maxim of the civil law Under the civil law legitimation was said to be a fiction of the law whereby one born out of lawful wedlock is considered the off spring of the marriage between the parents Cabelloro v Ex ecutor  La 573 cited in 3 Am  Eng Enc Law 895 note It may be that the court felt bound by the construction given to the law by the legislature when it provided that legitimacy should exist conformably to the maxim of the civil law But however that may be in the absence of any decision in Virginia holding such views I feel constrained not to follow the reason ing of the learned judge in that case I am of the opinion that the solution of this question lies in the proper construction of  2553 A child may be legitimatized and still not be born luring coverture It is not necessary to hold that he must be born in lawful wedlock in order to give full effect to the intent and purpose of the legislature which was to confer the right to inherit property upon a child born out of wedlock after marriage of parents and recognition just as if he were born in lawful wedlock The statute does not in words or by neces sary implication change the requisites for curtesy The common law incidents of marriage can be changed only by express enact ment or by necessary implication Neely v Lancaster 58 Am Rep 755 Bulles v Nunan 92 N Y 160 58 Am Rep 755 I am therefore of the opinion that the defendant is not en titled to curtesy in the land in the bill mentioned 1910 415 BOND V BOND

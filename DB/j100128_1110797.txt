objects of the enter prise is to acquaint the practitioner and the legislator with the legal institutions of foreign countries Another of its objects is to show the evolution and present development of juristic thought abroad and the extent to which a virile philosophy of law and a sound concepton of the relation between law and social science have succeeded in creating a jurisprudence which has proved far more efficient than the common law in responding to the needs of present day life In no country has this development of legal science been more fruitful than in Germany where modem research has intensified the truth of Sheldon Amos remark made forty years ago The prospects of the science of jurisprudence    will depend largely upon a greater familiarity than has hitherto been encouraged in legal education with the vast and invaluable juridical literature of Germany    Modern jurisprudence is em phatically a German creation To no country are these practical results of a sound legal philosophy more important than to the United States where the judicial interpretation of current economic and social legislation by outworn rules of the common law has awakened thoughtful men to the realization that that system has largely become sterile and no longer responsive to the needs of present day society2 It was Savigny who stated that in legal science all results depend upon the possession of legal principles and it was pre cisely on this fact that the greatness of the Roman jurists was based Theory and practice were combined in the administration of justice Savigny also pointed out the double danger to which the study of law is exposed on the one hand the danger of soaring through theory into the empty abstractions of a fancied law of nature on the other hand that of sinking through practice into a soulless unsatisfying handicraft The classical German philosophy of the first half of the nine teenth century proved susceptible to the first danger The failure to draw

dialectics and deductions from controlling conceptions they could construe the whole content of knowledge4 Much of the common law in its archaisms and anomalies and especially in its failure to rise to social and political emergencies has proved its susceptibility to the second danger An outworn individualistic conception of law and the absence of any legal philosophy are the responsible causes for this weakness The common law by safeguarding the rights of the individual at a period when class pressure in the rest of the world practically effaced the individual from the sphere of subjective legal rights did at one time eminently justify the encomiums heaped upon it But it has not kept pace with the changes in political and indus trial conditions In many respects as Pound has well expressed it the common law has become academic because derived by deduc tion from historical premises which have lost their value and hence much of their meaning for the society of today By its exaggerated respect for the rights of the individual at the expense of the needs of society by its continued application of archaic rules to modern economic conditions it has on many occasions proved a serious obstacle to social progress and has contributed not a little to the growing disrespect for law Only the doctrine of the police power developed practically in the last generation has rescued society from absolute thraldom to individual rights The traditional attitude of the common law to legislation in general judicial theories as to what constitutes class legislation such doc trines as the assumption of risk and contributory negligence the right to pursue a lawful calling the liberty of contract the retribu tive theory as a basis of the legal treatment of crimeall these justify the charge of sterility and emphasize the necessity for a change in our conception of law and its relation to life5 Coke admired the common law for its certainty because 3J F Dillon Laws and jurisprudence

developments in Japan and Switzerland indicate that the German code has replaced the Code Napoleon as the pro totype of modern civil codes Maitland in the introduction to his translation of Gierkes Political theories of the middle age says of the German Civil Code that it is the most carefully considered statement of a nations laws that the world has ever seen German codification exemplifies a power of legal expression with which Bryce credits the Roman jurists the power of so framing general rules as to make them the ex pression of legal principles and working out their details so as to keep the details in harmony with the principles2 In this process of legal development legal thinkers have exercised a profound influence The application of the historical and com parative method of jurisprudence in Germany has created a school of jurists who have helped to make law an effective handmaid in the development of social and political science A general acquaintance with the development of German juris tic thought and legal philosophy is perhaps best to be gained by a discussion of the most important literature and its contribution to the general movement To this end we shall undertake a rapid survey of the important literature on encyclopedia of law and on philosophy of law A Encyclopedia of law Legal encyclopedia or juristic survey is the term used by Ger mans to

One of the most important of this class of works has recently been made available to us in an English translation This is Gareis Introduction to the science of law Encyklopddie und Methodologie der

introduction to general jurisprudence and particularly to Ger man law it is of much value14 Two other works of this type must be noted One was written by the wellknown Adolph Merkell5 formerly professor at Strassburg and the other by Arndts6 the eleventh edition of which edited by Edwin Grueber appeared in I9o8 The more recent works on legal encyclopedia while in part preserving the abstract philosophical background are nevertheless more closely related to the provisions of the German Civil Code and to modern law in general This was less true of the earlier works on the subject They retained their philosophic atmosphere throughout and except for such portions as dealt with the topics for legal study or methodology indulged in not a little speculation This is true of Puchtas

Encyklopidie der Rechtswissenschaft infra The same author in I908 published an independent work on the subject largely a reprint of his article9 Dr Spiegels Beitrdge zur Kritik und Methodik der

it is now largely antiquated but its bibliographies are still useful The last edition appeared in I875 B Philosophy of Law Works on the philosophy of law Rechtsphilosophie take up the philosophical foundations of the legal order legal systems in stitutions and doctrines and the philosophical and ethical bases of particular branches of the law Works on the general theory of law Allgemeine Rechtslehre treat of general conceptions of law or of a legal system The division between the works on Rechtsphilosophie and Rechtslehre is often vague A class of work which also presents a scientific analysis of fun damental legal conceptions is the Introductory or General Part of works on Pandektenrecht or modern Roman law These works take up the details of a complete legal system Jurists have been arranged in schools or groups according to their methods or according to their fundamental conceptions of law in its origin nature or purpose Classifications however are by no means rigid and the lines between the schools are often very indistinct Jurists moreover are frequently identified with certain leaders in juristic thought whose doctrines they tend to follow or ap proacl The theories of these early leaders have now been largely abandoned but to adopt Sheldon Amos characterization they have stamped their personality their nomenclature their ethical tone and their methods of philosophical analysis so ineffaceably upon the science of jurisprudence that a survey of German legal phil osophy can not omit these master works Encyklopadie der Rechtswissenschaft Berlin O Hiring

Teubner 90o6 307COLUMIBIA LAW REVIEVW Method is an essential characteristic of every science Methods applied to legal science have gained recognition as they have proved of practical utility in producing a symmetrical system of law suitable to the needs of the people whose social relations it has to regulate The four methods principally employed in legal science have been the metaphysical or a priori the historical the analytical and the comparative each of which has had illustrious representatives The metaphysical method adopted by what was probably the largest class of the philosophical jurists investigates the abstract ideas of right and law in their relation to morality freedom and the human will Law becomes the expression of an idea In the hands of certain of its exponents this method gave new life to the school of natural law which regarded divine law as superior to human law the law of man being simply a part of a larger scheme of the universe In the hands of others it helped to supplant the lawofnature school The reaction against this latter school by the historical school helped to produce a new theory of law The historical jurist sees in law a product of time and unconscious evolution a rule of human action becomes the result of human experience The re action against the divine authority of law in favor of a consti tuted authority produced what has been called the positive school of thought represented by Hobbes in England in political philoso phy and by Thibaut in Germany as a practical dogmatist in law The opposition in England of the historical to the positive school finds a counterpart in Germany in the controversy between Savigny and Thibaut to which conflict we shall recur later The analytical method starts from the concrete from actually existing legal data defines the terms classifies them and explains their connotation and interrelation The analytical school essen tially of English origin first became important in Germany with Bindings Die Normen und ihre Ubertretung 187224 It con siders law as the product of a conscious or determinate human will The modern development of this method and its application to current social problems is identified with the name of Jhering Jhering represents a reaction against the historical school of Savigny While continuing to regard law as a historical phe nomenon Jhering denies that it is an unconscious growth on the contrary he asserts that it is and always has been made and that Leipzig Engelmann 187277 2nd ed 189o 308JURISPRUDENCE IN GERMANY means of serving human ends are discovered and fashioned con sciously into laws He agrees with the English analytic school in emphasizing the possibility of enforcement as an essential char acteristic of law The comparative method is concerned with space as the his torical is with time It collects and examines the doctrines rules and notions which are found in every developed legal system notes theiragreements and differences and thereby seeks to construct a system of law While this method has produced no distinct theory of law it has come into prominence through the works of Dahn Post and Kohler in which comparative ethnology and an thropology are considered as important bases of jurisprudence The leading representative of the metaphysical group was the great philosopher Kant I724I804 With Kant jurisprudence for the first time fell into the hands of the metaphysicians and this union of law and metaphysics characterized a considerable portion of the German legal philosophy of the early nineteenth cen tury Kants philosophy of law is contained in his work Die Mletaphysik der Sitten25 published in 1797 as the first part of his Metaphysic of morals the sequel and completion of his Foiuda dation for a

Professor Lorimers Institutes of law38 Pollock in his Essays in jurisprudence and ethics gives considerable space to Lorimers work and the theory39 The various schools of juristic thought have been in frequent opposition and the history of legal development in Germany is closely identified with their controversies The nineteenth century opened with the reaction by the historical school resurrected and rehabilitated by Hugo I764I844 against the school of natural law The first effective challenge of this revived school was extended by Savigny its most illustrious representative in his intellectual contest with the practical dogmatic school of Thibaut Savigny also opposed his historical method to the abstract meta physical speculations of the contemporary Hegelians After the controversies of Thibaut and Savigny on the possibility and utility of codification had been forgotten in the great construc tive work of codification and law reform which began with the Bills of Exchange Act Wechselordlung of I849 and which was continued in the Commercial Code of I86I and later in the Imperial statutes of 1877 the arena was cleared for the struggle between the Germanists and the Romanists While not strictly a conflict between philosophical conceptions or jurisprudence the contest may nevertheless be considered an effort of the then newly arising analytical school by its critical methods to overthrow the domi nant Romanism in German law These controversies having now largely subsided with the enactment of the Civil Code the social conditions of the present day have given rise to a new school which Roscoe Pound calls a sociophilosophical or sociological school This sociological school of juristic thought combines within it the methods of the historical analytical and revived philosophical schools The substance of the struggle between the historical and dog matic nonhistorical schools whose champions at the height of the controversy were Savigny and Thibaut is exemplified by two small works the one by Savigny I779I860 his celebrated Of the vocation of our age for legislation and jurisprudence first written in I8I440 and the other by Thibaut a pamphlet

contains45 in Savignys own words a refutation of the charge made against the historical school that its disciples sought to impose Roman law upon modern conditions in Germany In the latter part of the nineteenth century strict philosophy of law fell into disrepute because of its mistaken identification with the metaphysical speculations of Kant and Hegel Neverthe less such works as Lassons System

Review69 under the title Controversies of moder continental jurists The article contains an exposition of the gen eral legal philosophy and doctrines of Jhering Jherings leading work with which his juristic thought is usually identified is his Der Zweck im Recht Teleology of law70 This work is shortly to be translated under the title Law as a mteans to an end by Isaac Husik of the University of Pennsylvania as one of the Modern Legal Philosophy Series under the general editor ship of a Committee of the Association of American Law Schools The theories presented in this work constitute the basis for the discussion of Jhering in Pounds recent article and occupy a promin ent place in Munroe Smiths article on Four German jurists7 Berolzheimer while a NeoHegelian may be identified with the juristic conceptions of Jhering His most prominent contributions to literature are his five volumes on legal and social philosophy72 Part of his work Die Kulturstufe der Rechts und Wirtschafts philosophie is to be translated by Mrs Joseph Jastrow as volume II of the Modern Legal Philosophy Series This is to offer a com prehensive survey of the works of all the philosophers from the beginning to the present time in their treatment of legal theory Berolzheimers Rechtsphilosophische Studien73 assured him a prom inent place among present day scholars Jhering has exercised a strong influence on writers on the general theory of law particularly as to the essential element of enforcement Theodor Sternbergs Allgeineine Rechtslehre4 is among the more important of the recent works on

translation of Professor Hastings In its thorough grasp of legal concepts and its critical acumen it is of primary importance in the study of German juristic thought The work has been incorporated in the Modern Legal Philosophy Series as volume IV76 The practical need for a new philosophical jurisprudence brought to the front a jurist whose work has placed him in the very front rank of modern scholars This is Professor Rudolf Stammler of Halle a NeoKantian He represents a reaction against the historical school in his return to the philosophical method His theory of the social in place of the old individualistic ideal as a criterion of justice is in reality a legal theory of social justice which meets the social problems of the century and interprets the social will To quote Professor Pound the whole science of juris prudence has received a new standpoint Kantorovicz cited by Pound states that it is Stammlers endeavor to find a method of determining and directing the application of legal rules so that they shall have the quality of being objectively just He reaches justice through law instead of according to law All three of Stammlers leading works are of the utmost im portance For his philosophy of law his Lehre vorn dem richtigen Rechte77 is the most prominent Under the title The theory of jtstice this work is to be translated into English in the Modem Legal Philosophy Series His other important work Wirtschaft lund Recht78 is likewise an attempt to reach a theory of law and justice which shall fit current social problems Stammlers latest work Theorie der Rechtswissenschaft79 includes a complete system of his theory of jurisprudence He deals with the concept the validity the categories the method the ideal the technique the practice and finally with the history of law The book appeared too recently to receive the discriminating evaluation that it de serves The NeoHegelians whose most prominent disciple is their leader Josef Kohler have preserved and developed the historical method They have sought to relate this method to the philosophy of law to anthropology to ethnology and to economics Kohlers Attention may be called to a recent work on the general theory of law by August Sturm He calls it the psychological basis of law Its value is still uncertain Die psychologische Grundlage des Rechts Ein beitrag zur allgemeinen Rechtslehre Hannover Helwing I9Io Berlin Guttentag i9o207 2nd ed Leipzig Veit  Co I9o6 7Halle Waisenhaus 19II 317COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW most important contribution to the philosophy of law is his theory of the sociological interpretation and application of law Contrary to Savignys theory that law is an unconscious growth Kohler holds that law is a product of the culture of a people in the past and of the attempt to adjust it to the culture of the present in which a conscious effort may be prominent Scholars generally admit that Kohler is the most versatile if not the greatest of living jurists Kohlers leading work in this branch of law is his Lehrbuch der Rechtsphilosophie80 Under the title The Phil osophy of law this book is being translated into English by Adalbert Albrecht as one of the Modern Legal Philosophy Series It is expected to appear very shortly The mission and objects of philosophy of law is the title of an article by Professor Kohler which appeared in the Illinois Law Review81 It is a translation by Albert Kocourek of Chicago of an article which was first published in the Archiv fiir Rechts lund Wirtschaftsphilosophie It is a concise statement of Kohlers philosophy The translators final note on the philosophy of law in America is trenchant The object of Rudolf Bierlings Juristische Prinzipienlehre82 a work begun almost twenty years ago and just completed is to consider abstractly and present systematically the concepts and principles underlying positive law The author considers law as having a formal nature and thus differs essentially both from the old lawofnature school and from the modern legal philosophy An extensive review of the first volume by the late Professor E Holder of Leipzig is to be found in the Kritische Vierteljahres schrift fiir Gesetzgebung83 Besides reviewing volume one he dis cusses the basic principles of the whole work and Bierlings legal philosophy A recent work by the octogenarian Professor Ernst Immanuel Bekker entitled Grundbegriffe des Rechts und Missgriffe der Gesetzgebung84 deserves attention among works on this subject It is a philosophic study of the basic principles of law from the point of view of the association or group as a subject of legal rights A second volume is to contain a further discussion of the misconceptions and errors of legislation 80Berlin  Leipzig W Rothschild I9oo Vol 5 PP

publishers 319320 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW and legal philosophy if it has had no other practical utility has at least served to show the important results which sound theories of law have achieved in Germany It is hoped that the truth of Jherings thesis that law is not wholly nor even mainly a national product but that it has a universal character has been demon strated Finally the new direction which has been given in Ger many to jurisprudence by the necessity for dealing effectively with the social and economic problems of that country should demon strate to us who are confronted with similar problems the neces sity of abandoning an outworn insular conception of law These problems require a jurisprudence of vitality fashioned to meet social ends as a regulative agency in the adjustment of individual interests and a legal philosophy which shall draw its force from Mr Justice Holmes secret root of the lawthe conscious recog nition of social utility EDWIN M BORCHARD

ventrale Seite der Schabe gerichtet ist wirkt als Reiz der dieselbe zu Bewegungen veranlasst 8 p 9 Since then with modifications of his method Daven port and Perkins 2 and Frandsen 3 have investigated the same problem on a slug Limax maximus The former drew the conclusions that the precision of orientation of the slug varies directly with the active component of gravity 2 p 105 and that this tendency to go either up or down must be ascribed to some internal condition of the individuals for it varies in different individuals and in the same individuals at different times 2 p IIO The latter reached rather different con clusions thus The different geotactic response on a glass plate of different individuals is due mainly to two factors a The quantity and quality of the slime secreted which is a very im portant factor b the relative proportions of the length of the 1 From the Marine Biological Laboratory Woods Hole Mass and the Physio logical Laboratory University of Minnesota

3 p 205 The reactions of the marine forms of Littorina littorea L rudis etc to light and other influences have been studied by Mitsu kuri I2 Bohn i Haseman 4 and Morse I4 Unfortun ately however none of them has taken into consideration the response of the animals to gravity although the effect of gravity upon Littorina and upon gastropods in general is remarkable and easily observed at the seashore Following the example of Frandsen and of Davenport and Perkins an attempt was made by the writer with Littorina littorea to determine I What relation exists between a vari ation in the pressure of gravity and the precision of orientation  and 2 What determines whether the head end will be directed up or down The experimental work was done in the physiological depart ment of the Matine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole Mass during the summers of I912 and 1913 The results obtained in 19I2 used in this paper are indicated by the date I912 The others were all secured in I913 II MATERIAL AND METHODS I MaterialThe animal used in all the experiments was a marine snail Littorina littorea which is numerous about WVoods Hole The snails were collected by the writer in the morning or afternoon just before a new series of experiments was carried on and were kept in a large glass dish in running seawater during experiments The size of the animal used was about 15 x II cm It was found that this was the more convenient size for experimental purposes because the bigger i e older ones re treated into and remained for a long time in their shells when handled The younger animals are more active and quicker to respond to stimuli The same individuals could not be used throughout any series of experiments since their movements became abnormal due 1 The laboratory collector Mr Gray told me that the snails which I used were about one year old 58GEOTROPISM OF THE MARINE SNAIL LITTORINA LITTOREA 59 possibly to fatigue The same individuals could be used only for four or five trials Ten individuals sometimes Ii or I2 with anticipation of falls were used for each trial of a series of experiments As will be seen in the tables however very often less than 10 individuals were left on the support for observation the rest having fallen down 2 MethodsLoebs method 8 modified by Davenport and Perkins 2 and by Frandsen 3 of the different angles of in clination of a support on which the animals are to be placed was adopted with variations The support was a plain glass plate about 22 x I9 cm marked off on one side into squares of one sq cm each whereby it could be readily determined how far the animals moved from their original places The support or plate was placed in an apparatus by which it could be held at any tendegree angle between the horizontal and vertical see Fig I FIG i G P a plain glass plate The rest of the apparatus is all wood The animals were placed on the unlined side of the plate moistened and held upside down at an inclination say 10 toSAKYO KANDA the horizontal so that their heads were all directed upward Meanwhile seawater was poured two or three times over the animals and the plate surface to prevent their moving before the commencement of the experiment and at the same time to get them to stick tightly to the surface When the desired number of individuals had been so placed the support was reversed and placed at the desired angle in the holding apparatus so that their heads were now directed downward The animals being negative to gravity this procedure was necessary in order to determine their movements of orientation in a desired time Experiments were conducted either in seawater in a glass aquarium or in air To exclude the effect of light in either case a square box painted black inside was employed to cover the whole arrangement described above After the desired time for a particular experiment the cover box was removed Then the movements which the animals had made were recorded with detailed notes as nearly as possible as follows A movement of 8o0 from the original was designated as oriented 90go as horizontal and o as ori ginal If an animal was observed to have crawled downward from the original place it was recorded as positive to gravity It was noticed that some individuals did not crawl downward quite vertically but no discrimination as to these is made in the tables Quite a few individuals that crawled horizontally are also arbitrarily classified under horizontal although such movements are believed by the writer to have no great signifi cance A question might be raised about middle spaces between I80 and 9o and also between o and 9o Such positions were seldom observed but if any were observed they were recorded as  oriented  at a position between 90go and I80 as  horizontal between 90 and 45 and as original between 45 and o Moreover since quite a number of individuals would possibly have become oriented if they had been given longer than one minute it might have been better to describe them as  orienting  rather than horizontal The animals whose position was specified as original should not be interpreted as indifferent to gravity They simply failed to respond to it during the time 60GEOTROPISM OF THE MARINE SNAIL LITTORINA LITTOREA 61 when they were under experimentation The time factor was important This will be confirmed by the following preliminary experiment A But for the more detailed study the shortest possible time was adopted to avoid fatiguing the animals In all the following tables the signs indicate positive either to gravity or light by  and negative by  III EXPERIMENTS I Preliminary Experiments with Gravity and Light Preliminary Experiment AA tall beaker full of seawater was placed upside down in a large dish filled with seawater Special care was taken to exclude air bubbles from the beaker It was then supported on two pieces of glasstubing about 4 mm in diameter in the dish in order to let the seawater within com municate freely with the outside at the bottom By means of glasstubing seawater was run into the dish so as to have fresh seawater always at the bottom but so as not to let any air bubbles into the beaker Thirty selected snails were placed under the beaker and between the two pieces of the glasstubing which was not high enough to permit the snails within to crawl out from under the beaker The whole arrangement was then covered with the box already described to exclude light About ten minutes later it was found that all the snails had crawled up the vertical inside wall of the beaker and gathered at or near its top The seawater would be expected to be fresher and better supplied with oxygen at the bottom than at the top The snails however crawled upward just the same This was repeated several times but there was no exception to this rule Such results indicate that the upward movements of the snails are not caused by the lack of oxygen but by gravity This is also fully supported by the fact that the snails crawl upward on moist rocks or on a moist glass plate in air where the amount of oxygen does not vary Moreover in leaving the horizontal bottom of the dish to take positions on the vertical wall of the beaker the snails must have oriented themselves against the pull of gravity This orientation of the snails cannot be explained by the mechanical theory of geotropism It is an active process one of true response toSAKYO KANDA stimulation Loebs conclusion which was already referred to is thus confirmed Preliminary Experiment BAccording to Bohn and Mitsukuri Littorina littorea is negatively heliotropic To test their results a simple method of righting experiments was adopted as fol lows Ten selected individuals were placed dorsal side down on each of two glass plates The one was covered with the box and at the same time the other was exposed to diffused daylight both for five minutes The two lots were alternately covered and exposed to daylight after the animals had been refreshed in seawater and again turned on their backs The results given in Table I show that light considerably affects the right ing response of the animals TABLE I THE RIGHTING OF

explanation of this righting reaction of the snails it may not be out of place to refer to Loebs analysis in the starfish According to him the righting of the starfish is a stereotropic phenomenon but not geotropic io pp 6465 Recently Moore confirms this conclusion through experiments 13 p 237 while Jennings seems to have been misled in this respect 5 pp I20 148 The righting of the snails may also be a stereotropic phenomenon though it makes no difference for the present purpose In fact however as will be seen later contact stimuli interfere with the snails reaction to gravity The main point in 62GEOTROPISM OF THE MARINE SNAIL LITTORINA LITTOREA 63 regard to Preliminary Experiment B is that light is a factor in the behavior of these animals Preliminary Experiment CAccording to the mechanical theory of geotropism an animal becomes oriented head up because of its heavier posterior region or it orients itself with its head down because of its heavier anterior region or head An experiment was therefore made to determine which region of the snails the anterior or the posterior was heavier This was simple When an individual was placed on a glass plate in sea water with its dorsal side down it came out of the shell and made an effort to right It was then carefully dropped and watched as it sank before it retreated into the shell Every one of them sank with its anterior region up as expected The was done also with those individuals which were positive to gravity at a certain angle of inclination There was however no exception With the same point in mind empty shells were tested One of them was fixed by its ventral side on a small square cover glass with as little glue as possible At the three corners of the cover glass fine threads were fastened The center of gravity was found by suspension to be located somewhere in the posterior region This was done with a number of shells and the same results were obtained in every case These results therefore agree with the other observations indicating that the posterior region of the snails is heavier than the anterior region From the above results the writer is justified in concluding that the center of gravity of the snails is located in the posterior region and a possible inference from this conclusion is that the posterior region of the snails has a greater specific gravity than the anterior region This fact and inference may have a bearing in deciding whether the orientation of the animals against gravity is due to purely physical or mechanical pull This question will be considered throughout all the following experiments 2 Experiments to Show the Relation between the Pressure of Gravity and the Precision of Orientation Experiment ADavenport and Perkins asked and answered by experiment What relation exists between a variation in theSAKYO KANDA pressure of gravity and the precision of orientation of the slug 2 p ioo An attempt was made by the writer to determine experimentally the same question for Littorina littorea The experiments were conducted in seawater Light was excluded by means of the coverbox The results given in Table II show that the higher the angle the larger is the number showing negative geotropism and the lower the angle the larger the number of socalled positively geotropic animals TABLE II GEOTROPISM OF SNAILS AT THE DIFFERENT ANGLES OF INCLINATION OF A

surface of the earth The force of gravity stimulates the snails when it happens to pull along the line of the dorso ventral axis of the animals that is on the horizontal surface as the preliminary experiment A has shown But the larger the angle the shorter the time required for orientation This is shown in the horizontal column when the number of the animals most of which were  orienting at the end of one minute decreases as the angle of inclination to the vertical increases Experiment BIt has been supposed that hydrostatic pressure affects the reaction of an animal to gravity To decide this question a series of experiments was made in air Light was 64GEOTROPISM OF THE MARINE SNAIL LITTORINA LITTOREA 65 excluded as usual The results given in Table III show an interesting difference compared with those of Table II which must not be overlooked The number in the negative geotropism column in Table III is always higher than the corresponding one in Table II and that in the positive column in the former is always lower than that in the latter A possible explanation of these differences is found in the buoyancy effect of the water which decreases the weight of the animals In consequence the pull of gravity is more effective on the animals in air It would seem therefore that the pull of gravity on the animal as a whole must be one factor in its orientation TABLE III

I420 of geotropism in Paramecium If the greater weight of snails in air causes the quicker orientation of the animals and also if the posterior region of the animals is heavier than the anterior region as has been proven to be the case the theories above mentioned are favored to some extent Nevertheless no mechanical theory can satisfactorily explain why positive geotropism increases with decrease in the angle of inclination This if a real gravity response must be explained on the basis of physiological conditions as Loeb pointed out many years agoSAKYO KANDA The question however arises Is there any maximum or minimum of resistance or weight which makes the snails crawl either up or down This question will be answered later Although differences exist between Tables II and III the results in the latter table in general show a fair uniformity with Table II The hydrostatic pressure therefore seems seldom if ever to affect the negative reaction of the animals to gravity These two tables also show a fair agreement with the results obtained by Loeb 8 pp 68 Davenport and Perkins 2 pp IOIO5 and Frandsen 3 p I98 that is a steady increase in negative geotropism with increase in the angle of inclination Davenport and Perkinss view in this respect is fully confirmed 2 p 105 3 What Determines Whether the Head End Will be Directed Up or Down Experiment AInstead of the plain glass plate used for ex periments hitherto a groundglass plate was employed for the following experiments for two reasons I Since the animals live along a rocky seashore the plain glass plate may not be a proper support for them and 2 the animals being positively stereotropic it was thought well to test the effect of contact stimuli upon their geotropism Light was excluded in these experiments as usual In the results given in Table IV it is interesting to note as expected a decided decrease in the number of negatively geotropic and an increase of positively geotropic individuals with decrease in the angle of inclination Moreover below the 45 no individuals were in their originial position The animals can stick better to the ground plate than they do to the plain glass In consequence they can resist the pull of gravity better on the former than they do on the latter If so 1 On preparing Mr Kandas Ms for publication it strikes me that the chief difference between the experiments shown in Tables II and III lies in the buoyancy rather than the pressure factor Remembering that the air pressure must be added to that due to any depth of water the difference in pressure in Table II as contrasted with III is almost negligible But the weight of the animal in water is much less than in air The slight difference between Tables II and III is to me strong evidence against the buoyancy theory as playing any large part Mr Kanda is in Japan and I cannot call his attention to these points so I venture to add this footnote E P LYON 66GEOTROPISM OF THE MARINE SNAIL LITTORINA LITTOREA 67 this serves to indicate that resistance plays a part particularly in negative geotropism The resistance theory however does not explain why the animals leave the horizontal surface on which they are placed and crawl upward on the vertical wall of a beaker see preliminary experiment This fact is unexplained by any mechanical or resistance theory TABLE IV GEOTROPISM OF SNAILS AT THE DIFFERENT

perimented on were carefully dried on filter paper They were placed on a dry smooth glass plate with their heads directed upward Light was excluded and the animals examined after two minutes The movements of the animals on the plate were readily seen by the tracks of the mucus secreted by them Of 60 animals used 3I dropped off 6 or I5 per cent of the remainder oriented and crawled down 3I or 79 per cent crawled upward and one crawled horizontally The striking fact is the number of individuals that oriented positively and crawled down This evidence goes to show that the animals tend to become positive on a dry surface which would evidently serve as a pro tective reaction when they are left on rocks by a retreating tide The movements of the animals on the dry plate were regularSAKYO KANDA in some cases and irregular in others The figures given are therefore somewhat arbitrary To avoid this inaccuracy a few typical examples of movement are shown in figures as follows w wf FIG 2 The arrows in the figure indicate the movements during the experiment and the dots the movements of the animals after being placed on the plate but before the commencement of the experiment i e before the plate was covered by the dark box One thing is clear Some of the animals on the dry glass plate and also those placed on a dry wooden plate in an experi ment the results of which will be seen shortly after this oriented themselves and crawled downward in spite of the mechanical difficulties due to their shells Experiment CIn the next series a dry wooden plate was used instead of the dry glass plate in the same manner as in the above experiment Of 60 animals used 24 dropped off I9 or 52 per cent of the remainder oriented and crawled downward 6 or 16 per cent crawled up and 4 crawled horizontally Positive instead of negative geotropism was dominant even though the experiments were conducted at the angle of 90go Experiment DThe following series was of the same nature except that the animals were placed with their heads down and the time of experimentation was limited to one minute Of 60 individuals used 33 dropped 21 or 77 per cent of those remaining 68GEOTROPISM OF THE MARINE SNAIL LITTORINA LITTOREA 69 on the plate crawled downward only 2 oriented negatively and these did not crawl upward 4 failed to move As the animals were not compelled to orient themselves in order to move down the highest percentage of positive geotropism 2I individuals out of 27 or 77 per cent was obtained in this case That the character of the surface played a part is evident But some explanation is necessary When the coverbox was removed nine individuals which had crawled down as shown by the mucus were found with the head end of their shells directed vertically or with slight inclination to the vertical i e their shells mechanically oriented upward by the greater pull of gravity on the heavier posterior region Those individuals probably could not resist the pull of gravity and keep their shells from falling by their weight while others could Four individuals crawled downward not quite vertically on a diagonal line between vertical and horizontal It may be possible to explain this as a movement which was resultant of the pull of gravity on their shells and on themselvesthe resultant of a passive tendency to orientation and an internal response to gravitation From the above observations one may explain the habitat of the snails which usually live on rocky surfaces which lie between the hightide mark and one foot below the lowtide mark The limitation of upward movement is due chiefly to the exhaustion of moisture carried by their foot from the sea They seldom if ever crawl on dry rocks much higher than high tide mark though they do crawl on rocks clear out of seawater They seem to stop crawling when the moisture which they carry with themselves is exhausted This agrees with Mitsukuris and Hasemans observations It is not thinkable that either the dry glass plate or the dry wooden plate makes it easier for the snails to become oriented and to crawl downward than the groundglass plate did Never theless on the former surfaces many animals oriented themselves and crawled downward against the resistance of the heavier weight of their posterior region If this is true then the upward and downward movements of the snails can not be explained either by the resistance factor or the weight factor or by the both One thing is of course possible that  the quantity and qualitySAKYO KANDA of the slime secreted makes it easier for the animals to crawl downward or upward as Frandsen thinks in the case of slugs 3 p 205 The question however arises Why then did not the snails crawl upward instead of downward on the the dry glass and wooden plates In this respect Parker and Parshley offer a suggestive ex planation in the case of earthworms In the earthworm the response to dryness    is apparently the selective extraction of water from the peripheral protoplasm of the worm a process which is favored by capillarity of dry surfaces over which the worm begins to creep and is probably dependent chiefly upon evaporation from the surface of the worm itself Under such circumstances the materials in the peripheral protoplasm of the prostomium must become concentrated and probably initiates stimulation by undergoing some such change as partial coagula tion I5 p 363 If so the explanation must be looked for in physiological conditions that is internal rather than external mechanical factors As Parker and Parshley explain the dryness of the surface may cause the partial coagulation of the materials in the peripheral protoplasm of the foot as well as of the anterior geosensitive region of the snails which may also result in surface tension changes and contraction of muscle elements and cause the motion of displacement or coalescence of the fluid materials in the protoplasm of the musclefibers and internal cells as Lillie thinks 7 pp 252255 which possess different specific gravities Under such circumstances we may assume a disturbance in the peripheral as well as internal cells especially perhaps in the cells of the geosensitive region or the geotropic organs statocysts which disturbance may be assumed to stimu late and cause the response of the animals Whether the animal will go up or down will depend on the other stimuli besides gravity such as character of surface and degree of dryness which accom pany the stimulation of gravity itself This view quite agrees with Loebs 9 and Lyons II or 6 pp 2021 70GEOTROPISM OF THE MARINE SNAIL LITTORINA LITTOREA 71 4 The Effects of Light and Surfacefilm of Seawater Experiment AExperiments were conducted in the aquarium already described which was closely surrounded by a fourfold black cloth all over the sides and bottom The snails were placed on the glass plate about 25 cm below the surface film of seawater Part of the glass plate extended above the surface By this arrangement it was possible at the same time to test Hasemans conclusion that the upward and downward movements of the animals are not due directly to either geotropism or pho totaxis but to the action of the film of water 4 p 113 The results are given in Table V TABLE V GEOTROPISM OF SNAILS IN AND OUT OF SEAWATER IN DIFFUSE DAYLIGHT AT DIFFERENT ANGLES OF INCLINATION OF A GLASS

individuals 9 at 90 and 3 at 45 as shown in the last column of the same crawled upward until they reached the surfacefilm of seawater and thenSAKYO KANDA crawled horizontally Was this due to the action of the film of water as Haseman claims The question will be answered after consideration of a few other experiments Experiment BThe next series of experiments was of the same nature as the above but the animals were placed with their heads upward instead of downward at the beginning The results given in Table VI show that the starting position that is placing the animal head downward or upward at the beginning of the experiment makes a difference in the result TABLE VI GEOTROPISM OF SNAILS IN AND OUT OF SEAWATER IN DIFFUSE DAYLIGHT AT DIFFERENT ANGLES OF INCLINATION OF A GLASS PLATE

the surfacefilm of seawater Besides these six individuals at the angle of 90go and three at 45 hesitated at the surfacefilm when they reached it and then crawled upward through the film This constitutes a puzzle for the surfacefilm theory But let us see further Experiment CSimilar experiments were made in direct sun light The glass plate in the aquarium was placed at 45 which made it parallel to the rays of sunlight as nearly as possible The outside and bottom of the cylindrical glass aquarium were surrounded by black cloth as already stated and two sections a and b see Fig 3 separated within by the glass plate were 72GEOTROPISM OF THE MARINE SNAIL LITTORINA LITTOREA 73 covered above so that the sunlight penetrated parallel to the glass plate and through the open portion c So arranged the intensity and direction of the rays of the sunlight had to affect the reaction of the snails to gravity Since the animals were negatively heliotropic it was expected that most of them would crawl downward in this arrangement Their heads therefore were placed upward at beginning so that definite movements of orientation could be observed The    FIG 3 results after one minute were as follows Of 50 animals in I5 trials 5 or IO per cent had crawled upward all diagonally 37 or 74 per cent had crawled downward 22 of them being well oriented and I5 diagonally 8 or I6 per cent crawled horizontally and consequently across the lines of direction both of light and of the effective component of gravity The predominance of downward movement was no doubt due to the intensity and direction of the sunlight This point be comes clearer in the next experiments but it is clear that the surfacefilm has nothing to do with such reactions Experiment DWith the same point in mind other experi ments were made in a similar way but the animals were placed about I5 cm above the surface of the seawater In this case 29 individuals out of 50 oriented themselves downward and crawled in that direction through the surfacefilm of seawater into it Three crawled horizontally at the surfacefilm instead of going into the seawater I8 or 36 per cent crawled upwardSAKYO KANDA 5 The Effect of the Surfacefilm of Seawater The last of this series was planned in a little different way from the above entirely excluding light As a preliminary test the snails were placed on the glass plate at the angle of 561 in the aquarium which was half filled with seawater When those crawling upward reached the surface film of seawater and hesitated as Haseman calls it beneath the film the whole arrangement was covered with the dark box Ten seconds later the box was removed for observation Nearly all that had hesitated at the film were found to have crawled upward through the film Certain individuals at that time had already crawled upward as high as 3 cm from the film some 2 cm and others were just above the film This experiment was repeated several times and these results were readily demon strable Judging from the results the animals did not seem to have hesitated long after the light was excluded The hesitation of the snails at the surface of seawater seems to the writer to be due chiefly to the effect of light instead of to action of the surfacefilm of seawater This point also becomes evident after further consideration Quantitative experiments were conducted as indicated above The results are tabulated in Table VII and show rather compli cated conditions TABLE VII GEOTROPISM OF SNAILS AT THE DIFFERENT ANGLES OF INCLINATION OF A GLASS PLATE IN AND OUT OF

animals which were still below the surface at the end of one minute After the first minute twentysix individuals at the angle of 9o twentythree at 45 and one at I1I0 were found to have crawled upward through the surfacefilm of seawater Eighteen individuals at the angle of 9o eleven at 45 and thirteen at I 40 were just beneath the film of seawater And after another half minute sixteen individuals at the angle of 90go out of the eighteen which were beneath the film of seawater at the end of one minute nine at 45 out of the eleven ten at I I 4 out of the thirteen and one at the same angle which was crawling horizontally at the end of one minute had crawled upward through the film of sea water This is significant At the time of second observation also at the angle of 90go two individuals out of six which were crawling upward in seawater at the end of one minute at 45 five out of six and at I 40 one out of ten which were crawling horizontally at the end of one minute had crawled upward through the film But at the angle of 90g two individuals out of eighteen which were beneath the film at the end of the first period at 45 two out of eleven and at I 11 three out of thirteen that is only seven individuals altogether out of I50 still remained beneath the film even at the end of the second period This is decidedly contrary to the surfacefilm theory And at the angle of 90g two individuals out of six which were crawling upward in seawater at the end of the first period at i I 4 four out of five and at the same angle one which crawled downward in the first period were beneath the film at the end of the second period Referring again to the observation of Haseman that during a falling tide some snails are crawling down beneath the surface some with the surface and some above the surface 4 p I20 and which Haseman claims is due to the action of the film of water but not to either geotropism or phototaxis the writer is inclined to draw the conclusion based on the results of the series of the experiments above that the movements of the snails in question are not due directly if at all to the action of the film of water but to geotropism and heliotropism In nature especially in the daytime when the sun is shining a considerable part would be played by heliotropism as Mitsukuri already observedSAKYO KANDA Furthermore in the above experiment even the seven individ uals that still remained beneath the film at the end of the second period and whose failure to penetrate the film seems to favor the surfacefilm action theory may be considered in a different way The effect of light having been excluded their failure to emerge might be due to the susceptibility of these individuals to buoyancy when they had to crawl out of seawater This must be taken into consideration as has been shown It might also in com bination with the effect of light explain the behavior of those animals that crawled horizontally beneath the film or that  hesitated there as shown in a number of the preceding tables Whatever may be the explanation and even if one attributes the slight hesitation to the film itself it is evident that it has very little effect in determining the total behavior of the animals 6 The Effect of Chemicals Besides the above experiments attempts were made to control the negative geotropism of the snails by chemicals especially by salts and acids But all were unsuccessful except possibly an alcohol experiment Five snails were placed in a finger bowl containing IOO or I50 cc seawater to which about 10 cc of 95 per cent alcohol were added without stirring The finger bowl was shaded The animals crawled upward on the vertical wall of the bowl but as soon as they reached the upper layers they turned round and crawled downward The negative geotropism was thus apparently reversed But if the alcohol and seawater were well mixed by stirring the reversal was not definite and the experiment was not followed further IV DISCUSSION That Littorina littorea is negatively heliotropic was first shown by Bohn i and this fact has been confirmed by the present writer Morse however has published puzzling conclusions from his observations on this species He states During the days of June they were as a rule negatively phototactic and as night approached they became positively phototactic However after July I8 the preponderance of positive phototataxis during the day was very noticeable This period of transition corre 76GEOTROPISM OF THE MARINE SNAIL LITTORINA LITTOREA 77 sponded to the time of change from spring to neap tide during which the specimens out on the rocks were exhibiting a corre sponding change in phototaxis for the water did not reach them their behavior tallied with the description of Mitsukuri who showed that when desiccated periwinkles became positively phototactic and when wet turned negatively phototactic 14 p I45  Unfortunately Morse has given no description of his methods of experimentation But judging from his statements he has entirely overlooked the effect of gravity on the animal as Mit sukuri did Was not the supposed positive phototaxis after July I8 really an effect of gravity Littorina littorea does not in the writers opinion crawl upward on the rocks on account of positive heliotropism but on account of negative geotropism and in spite of negative heliotropism which is the unmistakable reaction of the animal to light Negative heliotropism in the animal is demonstrable even at night if the experiment is conducted on a horizontal surface and if there is any source of light present The writer believes that Morses statement that as night approached they became positively phototactic is incorrect What really happens is this As the light stimulus diminishes the gravity stimulus becomes preponderant and the animals are controlled by their negative geotropism Frandsen as already stated proposes two factors for the de termination of geotropism in the slug The second will be con sidered first All the conditions being the same he says it is this factor the relative proportions of the length of the anterior and the posterior regions of the animals body which determines whether the head end will be directed up or down If the ratio of the length of anterior to posterior region of body is 2  3 or more and the mucus is of good quality and sufficient quantity the slug will be positively geotactic If the ratio is 3  5 or less the animal will usually migrate upward and the nearer the ratio approaches I  2 the more apt is the slug to respond nega tively    All slugs have a natural tendency to move towards the earth This tendency is masked in the animals which are negatively geotactic on a glass plate by the greater pull of gravity 1 Italics not in the originalSAKYO KANDA on the disproportionately larger and heavier posterior region of the animal 3 p 205 Judging from these statements the center of gravity must lie somewhere in the posterior region of the animals body In other words the posterior region is heavier than the anterior According to Frandsen the negative geotropism of the animal on an inclined glass plate however is not due to the heaviness of the posterior region but to the relative proportions of the length of the anterior and the posterior regions of the animals body In short Frandsens idea may be expressed thus The longer and heavier posterior region being pulled by the con stant force of gravity the slug becomes positive to it at the minimal resistance in favor of the ratio above mentioned on the other hand it becomes negative at the maximal in disfavor of the ratio In the latter sense the resistance theory of course approaches the mechanical theory As pointed out before this seems to be fairly supported by the results obtained by the writer which were given in Tables II III and IV This explanation is however focused to a limited group of facts because the snail becomes negative to gravity on the nearly horizontal surface of a glass plate where the minimal resistance should be expected This fact is opposed to Frandsens conclusion Furthermore as has already been shown many snails on the dry wooden plate at the angle of 90go of inclination oriented themselves downward and crawled in that direction even though in so doing they met a great mechanical difficulty on account of the heavier posterior region If the mechanical theory of Frandsen is true they were under the most favorable conditions for crawling upward instead of downward This was not however the case Was this because of the first factor of Frandsen that is the quantity and quality of the slime se creted  3 p 205 The second factor in question is by no means separable from the first Both go together To make Frand sens statement clearer therefore it may be expressed as follows The relative proportions of the length of the anterior and the posterior regions of the animals body being the same it is this factor that is the quantity and quality of the slime se creted which determines whether the head end will be directed 78GEOTROPISM OF THE MARINE SNAIL LITTORINA LITTOREA 79 up or down It is fair to examine the table V which is given by Frandsen based on his results Take the animal No  I3 on which the series of observations a and b were made The condition of the animal was active in series a and also in series b that is it was under the same condition Being the same individual theoretically there was no difference in the ratio Nevertheless Frandsen obtained different results in a from b Moreover he shows different results in the same individual under the same condition and in the same series of observations a or b This is more striking in the animal No 23 on which the series of observations a b c and d were made under the same condition good But he obtained 642 per cent of negative geotropism in series a 625 per cent in the b Ioo per cent in the c and Ioo per cent in the d In other words the same individual under the same condition was at least 357 per cent positive in a 374 per cent in b and o per cent in c and d This kind of variation is also found in the animals Nos 8 24 25 and 27 If so all the conditions being the same it is not entirely the first factor nor the second which determines whether the head end will be directed up or down but there must be something else besides these two factors which makes the response variable Frandsen does not seem therefore to be justified even by his experimental data in his conclusions And strictly speaking the socalled mechanical theory of geotropism seems to the writer to be misleading in any case because it is not a living response to stimulus but a purely mechanical one which would be seen as well in the dead organism if it could be moved This is no tropism at all In this respect therefore the writer is inclined to take Daven port and Perkinss conclusion into consideration as at least one of the factors that is some internal condition of the individual Without this internal or physiological factor it is difficult to explain why geotropism varies in the different individuals and also in the same individual at the different angles of inclination of the same support and the same angle of inclination of different supports Hasemans conclusions demand close consideration on severalSAKYO KANDA points Haseman states Even more interesting is the fact that when with a vertical surface a stone upon which snails were crawling at random was raised out of the sea the snails always followed the vanishing film of water even when the vertical surface was rotated through an angle of I80 In this case the rotation of the vertical surface would reverse the direction of motion of the film of water and the snails would at once turn around and follow it But if most of the water was previously removed from the surface of the stone in order that the film might entirely disappear before the snails which were crawling downward in the direction of the vanishing film had reached the lower surface and if as the film was drying up the vertical surface was rotated through an angle of I80 the snails continued to crawl for some time in the direction in which they had started In other words the snails crawled upward instead of downward They continued to crawl thus until the rough surface food and moisture either deflected or stopped their movements In the above experiment the mere turning of the moist but filmless surface through an angle of I80 does not seem adequate to reverse at once the reaction to gravity and light if either of these have a direct influence on the rhythmical movements of Littorina 4 p 116 Certainly this is not a simple matter In the first phase Haseman does not state where the above experiment was conducted what condition of sunlight or diffuse daylight there was and if the experiment was in sunlight in what direction the rays were falling and so on His description as well as ex periment is not at all accurate Judging from the above descrip tion however he seems to have conducted the experiment in nature and so in sunlight If so and if the sun were fairly above it is small wonder that when the vertical surface was rotated through an angle of I8o thus rotating the motion of the film of water  the snails would at once turn around and follow it since the snails are negative to light as has been shown In the case of Haseman where the film was reversed in which the vertical surface was rotated through an angle of I8o and the snails continued to crawl for some time in the direction upward in which they had started another explanation is possible The 80GEOTROPISM OF THE MARINE SNAIL LITTORINA LITTOREA 81 snails being negatively geotropic the direction and intensity of sunlight were not at the time of this experiment presumably in favor of the reversal of negative geotropism Therefore the snails continued to crawl upward instead of downward This is of course reasoned upon the results which were obtained by the writer At any rate Haseman seems not to have checked the counteracting forces of gravity and light and consequently all his experiments are unreliable One afternoon from four to six oclock Dr Irving A Field and the writer made special observations of tidal rising influence upon the snails at the south shore of Ram Island The animals were found in large numbers covering a pair of long square beams which formed an inclined railway These beams presented both vertical and sloping surfaces In this vicinity there were also rocks and stones of various shapes their surfacessloping at many different angles on which numerous snailsoriented with their heads upwardwere exposed in dim sunlight When the tide rose higher and higher with no waves and reached to the areas where the animals had been exposed so long that their outer surfaces were completely dried nearly all of them if not the entire number gradually turned head downward and crawled in that direction some of them moved downward several inches from the original spots while some others moved about at random as if they were seeking food and still others turned downward when the surfacefilm of seawater came in contact with them while many did so after the surfacefilm had passed over them to the extent of 05 or I cm more or less If the snails follow the direction of motion of the film of water and also if light has no influence on the rhythmical movements of Littorina as Haseman claims why did not the snails crawl upward instead of downward Thus considered it becomes evident that Hasemans observation or experiment was not accurate while Mitsukuris is in this respect confirmed by the writer It is very strange to note that Haseman has no notion of the influence of gravity on the snails although he has observed phe nomena which would naturally remind one of it When individuals are left high and dry on vertical surfaces during lowSAKYO KANDA tide he says they come to rest directed upward i e with their heads toward the sky This is true for all sides of the stones and is obviously due to the shape of the apertures of the shells which makes it far easier for exposed individuals to cling thus to vertical surfaces 4 p II7 How does he know that the shape of the aperture of the shells makes it easier to cling to vertical surfaces Is it not rather true that the natural tendency of negative geotropism of the snails favored by the heavier posterior region of the shells instead of the shape of the aperture makes it far easier for exposed individuals to cling thus to vertical surfaces This sounds more reasonable and nearer to the fact than Hasemans supposition V SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS I Littorina littorea crawls up the vertical inside wall of a beaker in a dark aquarium though the seawater be better sup plied with oxygen at the bottom than at the top It is negatively geotropic 2 This snail is negatively heliotropic 3 The posterior region of the snail has a greater specific gravity than the anterior region 4 In seawater the larger the angle of inclination to the horizontal of the surface on which the animals move the larger is the number of negatively geotropic animals and the smaller the angle of inclination the larger the number of animals which move downward and are perhaps positively geotropic 5 In the air the number of animals showing negative geo tropism is always higher than that in the seawater 6 On a ground glass plate the animals are less negatively geotropic than on a plain glass plate 7 On a dry plain glass plate a number of individuals oriented positively and crawled downward even at the angle of 90 ver tical though this never happens on the moist plate This is more striking on a dry wooden plate 8 When the animals are placed with their heads down on a dry wooden plate the highest percentage of positive geotropism is obtained 9 The snails hesitate at the surfacefilm of seawater when light is not excluded 82GEOTROPISM OF THE MARINE SNAIL LITTORINA LITTOREA 83 io In the direct sunlight the snails are apparently more positively geotropic than in darkness due to the fact that they are negatively heliotropic II In the direct sunlight 58 per cent of the animals orient themselves head downward and crawl in that direction through the surfacefilm of seawater into it 12 In darkness the snails which hesitated at the surface film of seawater in the daylight crawl upward through the film 13 From the experimental results which the writer has ob tained he concludes that neither the mechanical theory nor the pressure theory nor the resistance theory is adequate to explain the phenomenon of the negative geotropism of Littorina littorea but a physiological one that is the statocyst or statolith theory This theory is the more likely since these snails have statoliths I7 pp II9I20 The writer however has no direct evidence at present in favor of the statolith theory He is led to accept it largely by the method of exclusion Furthermore evidence from many sides based on the experiments of the writer causes him to conclude that the surfacefilm theory is also not correct In conclusion the writer wishes here to acknowledge his indebtedness to Professors Walter E Garrey Ralph S Lillie and Elias P Lyon for their valuable suggestions and criticism on his experiments at the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole Mass during the summers of 1912 and 1913 His thanks are also due to Professor Frank R Lillie for the privileges of the Laboratory and to Professor Lyon for criticism and suggestions in the preparation of manuscript VI BIBLIOGRAPHY i Bohn Georges 05 Attractions et Oscillations des animaux marins sous linfluence de la lumere Bull d lInst gener d Psychol pp

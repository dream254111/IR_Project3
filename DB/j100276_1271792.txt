action upon which suit has been or may hereafter be brought by the injured party for personal injuries other than those resulting in death shall not abate by his death but shall survive in favor of the heirs and legal representatives of such injured party Personal injuries out of which an action for damages arose were inflicted and action instituted but soon after the plaintiff died and the action was abandoned The plaintiff in this action believing herself to be the lawful wife of the deceased commenced suit but upon learning of the existence of a former wife filed an amendment asserting her rights as a putative wife It was held that a woman who in good faith married a man in ignorance of the fact that he had a wife living and lived with him until his death in ig norance of such fact is entitled to enforce a cause of action for injuries to the man which did not result in his death Ft Worth  R G Ry Co v Robertson et al T909  Tex Civ App  121 S W 202 This case seems to

husband during the marital relation entirely independent from her in 158

material of the late Professor Henry Hemphill of Los Angeles The collection contains be tween 8000 and 9000 specimens of shells and 150 volumes The material is of very great importance in the study of the Tertiary geol ogy of the Pacific coast and especially of the geology of the petroleum deposits of California THE trustees of the Presbyterian Hospital New York City have taken an option to pur chase the former American League baseball grounds bounded by Broadway Fort Wash ington avenue 165th and 168th Streets This site is owned by the New York Institute for the Education of the Blind which has been holding it in the market at 2000000 Pur chase of the site is made possible by the be quests of the late John S Kennedy by whose will the hospital receives about 2500000 It is understood that the College of Physicians and Surgeons the medical school of Columbia University would be removed to the new site Mr Edward S Harkness gave in 1910 1 500000 toward an alliance between the hospital and the university UNIVERSITY AND EDUCATIONAL NEWS BY the will of General Brayton Ives of New York City the largest part of his estate is be queathed to Yale University for its general purposes The daily papers estimate the value of the bequest at from 750000 to 1500000 MR W E ALLEN of Sheffield has be queathed about 750000 to public purposes including 25000 and part of the residuary estate to the University of Sheffield for work in applied science AcCORDING to private information received from Mexico the Carranza government has closed all educational and scientific institu tions in Mexico including not only the Uni versity the Geological Institute the Medical Institute and the National Museum but also all normal schools high schools and elemen tary schools under its control THE department of chemistry at Iowa State College Ames Iowa is now installed in the 601 new chemistry building which replaces the one destroyed by fire in March 1913 The build ing is constructed entirely of brick stone and concrete and is as near fireproof as possible The initial cost was 200000 and the build ing is 244 feet by 162 feet three stories high with a usable basement THREE Whiting fellowships in physics each with an income of 600 for the college year 191516 have been filled at the University of California Fellowships on this endowment fund are conferred for the purpose of further ing advanced study either abroad or at an American university STUDENTS in the newly established forestry school at the University of California are to receive instruction in game conservation They will be taught to recognize at sight the different species of game fish and animals and will be informed as to the economic value of each and the means by which they can be con served Dr I C Bryant in charge of the bureau of education publicity and research recently established by the California Fish and Game Commission will give the introductory lectures He will be followed by N B Sco field in charge of the department of commer cial fisheries and Dr W P Taylor curator of mammals in the University of California Mu seum of Vertebrate Zoology DR ANDREW HUNTER of the Cornell Med ical School has been appointed professor of pathological chemistry in the University of Toronto DR R TRAVERS SMITH has been appointed to the chair of materia medica therapeutics and pharmacology in the school of surgery of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland DISCUSSION AND CORRESPONDENCE EVIDENCE BEARING ON THE ORIGIN OF HUMAN TWINS FROM A SINGLE OVUM ON the suipposition that twins originate always from two ova and that the chances are even as to whether an individual of a pair of twins is to be male or female the ratio of like pairs to those whose members are of dif ferent sex may be worked out according to the laws of chance The Mendelian ratio APRIL 2 1915N S VOL XLI No 1057 under corresponding circumstances is 1 2 1 that is there should be one pair of boys to two mixed pairs to one pair of girls In other words if the members of a pair of twins al ways developed from separate ova we should expect to find twice as many pairs whose mem bers differ in sex as there are pairs of girls or pairs of boys I have been able to think of no factor which may reasonably be supposed to be acting in a constant direction to alter this ratio I have undertaken to compare with this liypothetical ratio the ratio found among births of twins in this country My data number 3334 twin births which occurred in the states of Connecticut Maine and Ver mont during the years 1899 to 1912 Of this number 1118 are pairs of boys 1193 are boy and girl and 1023 are pairs of girls This is almost a 1 1 ratio showing the effect however of the predominance of male births There is obviously a large excess of pairs sim ilar in sex over what is to be expected on the supposition that twins originate in all cases from separate ova an excess of more than 500 pairs of boys and almost 500 pairs of girls This seems to point towards the conclusion that twins may originate from a single fer tilized ovum In the light of present knowl edge this certainly is a possible explanation of the statistics If the figures given will bear this interpretation we may say that less than half 443 per cent of the twin births of sim ilar sex or less than one third 284 per cent of all twins originate from one ovum while slightly more than half 557 per cent of those of similar sex have developed simul taneously from two separate ova MARGARET V COBB FALLS CHURCHn VA NATURALISTS DIRECTORY To THE EDITOR OF SCIENCE As you have given liberal space to criticize the book you will doubtless be willing to give space in which I can explain the matter In the first place this book has not been issued for some eight years and in getting out the new edition I decided that not a single name would be included unless I had a request that the name should be included from each party If you find that there are a good many naturalists omitted from the directory it was because they were too busy or more likely too careless of such matters to take time to return the blanks which I sent them Every nat uralist of any consequence and a great many collectors received three notices each and none of the names were included in the book unless they replied Since getting out the work some of these noted scientists have taken time to write three or four criticisms of the book while they would not take time before publication to even sign their names to the blanks I sent them There are a few typographical errors in the book as there are bound to be in any work of this kind and the transposition of two or three entries to which you have taken great pains to call attention was caused by the misplacement of one or two linotype slugs It is my intention to get out another edition of the Naturalists Directory in a year from now and I hope naturalists generally will be as free with their assistance in bringing the new edition up to date as they have been in criticizing the edition just published S E CASSINO SALEM MASS SCIENTIFIC BOOKS Die Variolation im achtzehnten Jahrhundert Ein

J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107528,AN ACCOUNT OF THE DISCOVERY OF A MASS OF NATIVE IRON IN BRASIL,I206971, 70 1 XV AN ACCOUNT OF THE DISCOVERY OF A MASS OF NATIVE IRON IN BRASIL BY A F MORNAY ESQ IN A LETTER TO W L  WOLLASTON M D SEC R S READ MAY 16 1816 DEAR SIR NEAR FIVE YEARS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE I PRESENTED YOU WITH A SPECIMEN OF NATIVE IRON FROM BRASIL PARTICULAR REASONS PREVENTED ME AT THAT TIME FROM MAKING IT MORE GENERALLY KNOWN AND SINCE THEN MY PRIVATE AFFAIRS HAVE NOT ALLOWED ME A MOMENT TO LOOK INTO MY NOTES AND GIVE YOU THIS SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE BLOCK FROM WHICH YOUR SPECIMEN WAS CUT ALTHOUGH I HAVE SO OFTEN PROMISED IT YOU IN THE AUTUMN OF 181O I DISCOVERED NEAR BAHIA A SPRING OF WATER STRONGLY IMPREGNATED WITH IRON WHICH WAS ESTEEMED A MOST VALUABLE ACQUISITION IN THAT COUNTRY THIS CIRCUM STANCE CALLED TO THE RECOLLECTION OF THE GOVERNMENT THAT ABOUT 30 YEARS BEFORE INFORMATION HAD BEEN RECEIVED OF THE DISCOVERY OF CERTAIN THERMAL SPRINGS SITUATED AT THE DISTANCE OF 40 OR 5O LEAGUES TO THE NORTHWARD AND AS HIS ROYAL HIGH NESS THE PRINCE REGENT OF PORTUGAL HAD ENQUIRED DURING HIS STAY AT BAHIA WHETHER THE COUNTRY POSSESSED ANY THERMAL WATERS I WAS REQUESTED TO VISIT THE SPOT WHERE THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO EXIST THE GOVERNOR GENERAL OFFERED ME EVERY FACILITY AND PROTECTION AND IN ORDER TO INDUCE ME TO UNDER TAKE THE JOURNEY SOME OF MY FRIENDS DESCRIBED TO ME ANMR MLORAYS ACCONT OF NATIVE IRON IN BRASIL EXTRAORDINARY STONE WHICH HAD BEEN FOUND STILL FARTHER UP THE COUNTRY IN THE SATNE DIRECTION IT HAD BEEN SUPPOSED TO BE SILVER OR IRON OR THAT FTEVRRUGINOUS AGLORNERATION SO COMMON IN BRASIL WHICH OFTEN ENVELOPES GOLD AND I BELIEVE SOMETIMES DIAMONDS ON THE OTHER HAND SONE PERSONS WHO PRETENDED TO HAVE SEEN IT ASSERTED THAT IT WAS NOT A MASS OF ANY METAL BUT HAD ONLY THE METALLIC SOUND ON BEING STRUCK COMMON TO NUMEROUS BLOCKS OF STONE IN THE SAME NEIGHBOURHOOD CALLED BY THE INHABITANTS SERPENT STONES IN CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR EXFOLIATING BY DECOMPOSITION AT THE SURFACE AS THE SERPENT CASTS HIS SKIN YEARLY SO THEY SUPPOSE THESE STONES TO DO SOME ACCOUNT OF THE DISCOVERY OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY MASS HAD BEEN GIVEN TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BAHIA AND THROUGH THE INSPECTOR GENERAL OF THE MILITIA A MAN OF GREAT TALENTS AND CONSIDERABLE LEARNING I OBTAINED A SIGHT OF THE PAPERS ON THE SUBJECT EXISTING AT THE GOVERNMENT HOUSE ON READING THEM I WAS DECIDEDLY OF OPINION THAT THE MASS DESCRIBED WAS NATIVE OR METEORIC IRON AND I DETERMINED TO GO TO SEE IT BUT BEFORE I RELATE MY OWN OBSERVATIONS I WILL GIVE YOU THE SUBSTANCE OF THE NOTES WHICH I TOOK OUT OF THOSE PAPERS IN THE YEAR 1784 A MAN OF THE NAME OF BERNARDINO DA MOTA BCRELHOWHILE LOOKING AFTER HIS CATTLE NOTICED THE BLOCK IN QUESTION AS BEING DIFFERENT FROM ALL THE OTHER STONES ON THE SPOT AND INFORMED THE GOVERNOR GENERAL OF THE PROVINCE OF BAHIA OF HIS OBSERVATION HIS EXCELLENCY IMMEDIATELY ORDERED THE HEAD MAN OF A NEIGHBOURING VILLAGE THAT IS TO SAY AT THE DISTANCE OF NEAR FIFTY LEAGUES TO GO AND EXAMINE IT HE DID SO AND REPORTED VERY MARVELLOUS THINGS CALLIRG THE MASS SOMETIMES IRON AND SOMETIMES STONE BUT GIVING TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT CONTAINED GOLD AND SILVER THE GOVERNOR ALMR MORNAYS ACCOUNT OF TBE DISCOVERY GENERAL COMMANDED HIM IN CONSEQUENCE TO HAVE IT CON VEYED TO BAHIA THIS MAN RETURNED TO THE SPOT AND AFTER HAVING EXCAVATED ROUND THE BLOCK SO AS TO BE ABLE TO GET THE ENLDS OF FOUR POWERFUL LEVERS UNDER IT HE CONTRIVED BY GREAT EXERTION WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THIRTY MEN TO TURN IT ON ITS SIDE HE OBSERVED THE BED ON WHICH IT RESTED TO BE OF THE SAME SCALY SUBSTANCE THAT WAS ATTACHED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE MASS AND ABOUT EIGHTEEN INCHES THICK ABOUT THE LATTER END OF 1785 HE CONVEYED TO THE SPOT A WAGGON OR RATHER A TRUCK BUILT FOR THE PURPOSE AND SUC CEEDED IN GETTING THE MASS OF IRON INTO IT BUT HAVING SPENT THREE DAYS IN THIS OPERATION THE MEN EMPLOYED WERE OBLIGED TO DEPART IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE NEIGHBOURING RIVULET BEING BRACKISH AND NOT FIT TO BE DRANK THEY RETURNED HOWEVER AND YOKED OXEN TO THE TRUCK BUT THEY COULD NOT MOVE IT UNTIL THEY HAD PUT ON TWENTY PAIR OF OXEN ON EACH SIDE YOU MUST OBSERVE THAT THEIR OXEN ARE NOT OF THE STRENGTH OF OURS THAT THE GROUND WAS A LOOSE GRAVEL AND THAT THE TRUCK WAS CONSTRUCTED ON THE VERY WORST PLAN THE WHEELS BEING FIXED TO THE AXLE TREES AND THE TWO AXLE TREES REMAINING CONSTANTLY IN A PARALLEL POSITION WITH RESPECT TO EACH OTHER THEY PROCEEDED HOWEVER IN THIS MANNER TO THE DISTANCE OF ABOUT ONE HUNDRED YARDS WHEN THEY GOT INTO THE BED OF THE RIVULET ABOVEMENTIONED CALLED THE BENDEG6 THERE IT WAS STOPPED BY THE PROMINENT POINT OF A ROCK AND AS THE TRUCK WAS ONLY CALCULATED TO MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE IT WAS ABANDONED I VISITED THIS MASS ON THE I7TH OF JANUARY 181  AND FOUND IT STILL ON THE WAGGON OR TRUCK WHERE IT HAD BEEN LYING FOR FIVE AND TWENTY YEARS IT IS SITUATED NEAR THE LEFT BANK OFOF A MASS OF NATIVE IRON IN BRASIL THE RIVULET BUT ENTIRELY IN ITS BED WHICH WAS THEN DRY AND IS VERY SELDOM OTHERWISE I SEND YOU A VERY CORRECT OUTLINE OF THIS MASS PI XI IT IS ABOUT 7 FEET LONG 4 FEET WIDE AND E FEET IN THICKNESS BESIDES A SORT OF FOOT ON WHICH IT NOW STANDS OF ABOUT SIX INCHES IN HEIGHT TLHE SOLID CONTENTS HOWEVER CANNOT BE INFERRED CORRECTLY FROM THESE DIMENSIONS SINCE THE BROAD PART IS HOL LOWED OUT UNDERNEATH VERY CONSIDERABLY AFTER MAKING DUE ALLOWANCE FOR THE CAVITIES I ESTIMATED ON THE SPOT THE SOLID CONTENTS OF THE WHOLE MASS TO BE AT LEAST 28 CUBIC FEET WHICH AT 5OOLB WILL MAKE ITS WEIGHT TO BE 14OOOLB ITS COLOUR IS EXACTLY THAT OF A CHESNUT AND IS GLOSSY AT THE TOP AND SIDES BUT THE HOLLOW PART UNDERNEATH IS COVERED WITH A CRUST IN THICK FLAKES OUTWARDLY OF THE COLOUR OF RUST OF IRON AND STAINING THE FINGERS THE FLAKES ARE VERY BRITTLE AND THE FRESH FRACTURE IS BLACK AND BRILLIANT LIKE SOME MAGNETIC IRON ORES THE GLOSSY SURFACES OF THE BLOCK ARE NOT SMOOTH BUT SLIGHTLY INDENTED ALL OVER AS IF THEY HAD BEEN HAMMERED WITH A RATHER LARGE ROUND HEADED HAMMER THERE ARE SEVERAL CAVITIES IN IT FROM THE DIAMETER OF A 12LB CANNON BALL TO THAT OF A MUSKET BALL THE LARGER ONES BEING SHALLOW BUT THE OTHERS MUCH DEEPER THEY ALL CONTAIN THE SAME SUBSTANCE AS IS ATTACHED TO THE GREAT CAVITY UNDER NEATH AND SOME OF THEM ALSO FRAGMENTS OF QUARTZOUS STONES WHICH I WAS OBLIGED TO BREAK IN THE HOLES IN ORDER TO GET THEM OUT THE BROWN COLOUR OF THE SURFACE OF THE BLOCK IS MERELY A VERY THIN COAT OF RUST FOR THE SLIGHTEST SCRATCH WITH A KNIFE PRODUCES A BRIGHT WHITE METALLIC STREAK AND YET 273MR MORNAYS ACCOUNT OF THE DISCOVERY WHEREVER THE MASS IS STRUCK WITH A STEEL IT GIVES OUT SPARKS ABUNDANTLY WHEN RUBBED WITH A QUARTZOUS PEBBLE IN THE DARK IT BE COMES BEAUTIFULLY LUMINOUS THE BLOCK IS MAGNETIC AND EVEN POSSESSES WELL MARKED POLES IN THE OUTLINE I HAVE INDICATED THEIR POSITION THE N POLE IS NOT SO WELL CHARACTERIZED AT THE SHORTER POINT OF THE SAME END THE N POLE OF THE BLOCK LIES AT PRESENT NEARLY ENE BEFORE IT WAS REMOVED IT LAY ABOUT N N E I OUGHT TO TELL YOU THAT LA MOTA BOTELHO WHO FIRST NOTICED THIS OBJECT ACCOMPANIED ME AND AS HE WAS PRESENT AT ITS REMOVAL HE WAS ABLE TO GIVE ME MUCH INFORMATION BEING A VERY INTELLIGENT MAN THE N POLE IS BY MUCH THE MOST MASSIVE END AND LAY DEEPER IN THE GROUND THAN THE OTHER NO PART OF THE MASS HAS THE POWER OF ATTRACTING IRON FILINGS WHETHER THE SPOT HAVE BEEN FILED TO BRIGHTNESS OR NOT I HAD PROVIDED MY ELF WITH A SLEDGE HAMMER AND TOOLS FOR CUTTING OFF SOME SPECIMENS OF THE IRON BUT IT WAS WITH THE UTMOST DITFICULTY THAT I COULD DETACH THE FEW SMALL PIECES WHICH YOU HAVE SEEN ONE OF WHICH I GAVE TO YOU ON MY ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND THE LARGEST I PRESENTED TO MY LORD DUNDAS TO WHOM I AM UNDER MANY OBLIGATIONS AND WHO PR MISED TO PLACE IT IN THE COLLECTION OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY I ALSO PRESENTED FRAGMENTS TO OUR LAMENTED FRIEND MR ILNNANT AND TO DR MARCET ANOTHER SPECIMEN BEAUTIFUILY CRYSTAL LIZED I DISPOSED OF TO MR HEULAND AND I HAVE ONLY SOME SMALL PIECES LEFT AS SOON AS THE FIRST PIECE WAS DETACTLED I WAS STRUCK WITH THE APPEARANCE OF INTERNAL CRYSTALLIZATION NOT 274OF A MASS OF NATIVE IRON IN BRASIL HITHERTO NOTICED IN METEORIC IRON BUT AS YOUR SPECIMEN SHOWS THIS CIRCUMSTANCE VERY WELL I NEED NOT DESCRIBE IT NONE OF THE FRAGMENTS POSSESS MAGNETIC POLES NO VITREOUS SUBSTANCE APPEARS ABOUT THE MASS AS IN MANY OF THE KNOWN BLOCKS OF METEORIC IRON HAVING TAKEN A FEW REAGENTS WITH ME FOR THE EXAMINATION OF THE THERMAL SPRINGS WHICH HAD BEEN POINTED OUT TO ME I TRIED THE MALLEABLE PART OF THE MASS ON THE SPOT FOR NICKEL AND I THOUGHT AT THE TIME THAT ITS PRESENCE WAS INDICATED BUT I AM NOW SATISFIED THAT THE PHANOMENA WHICH I NOTICED MIGHT HAVE ARISEN FROM IRON ALONE I HAVE FOUND MY SPECIMENS MORE LIABLE TO RUST I THINK THAN WROUGHT IRON GENERALLY IS AND IN A DAMP ATMOSPHERE A LIQUID OOZES OUT FROM THE CREVICES I REPAIRED TO THE SPOT WHERE THE MASS WAS DISCOVERED NAMELY ON A RISING GROUND ON THE LEFT BANK OF THE RIVER BENDEGO AND CAUSED THE SOIL AND GRAVEL TO BE REMOVED UNTIL WE CAME TO THE BED DESCRIBED IN THE GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS WE FOUND IT AT LESS THAN THREE FEET DEPTH I HAD EXPECTED TO FIND IN IT A CONSIDERABLE PROTUBERANCE SUCH AS MIGHT HAVE FITTED THE CAVITY UNDERNEATH THE MASS OF IRON FOR I WAS CON VINCED THAT THE BLOCK ITSELF MUST HAVE BEEN FIRMLY ATTACHED TO THE BED OTHERWISE IT WOULD NOT HAVE REQUIRED SUCH A CON SIDERABLE POWER TO TURN IT ON ITS SIDE HOWEVER I DID NOT AND THINKING THAT WE WERE NOT EXACTLY ON THE SPOT I CAUSED TWO TRENCHES TO BE OPENED DOWN TO THE BED AND CROSSING EACH OTHER THE ONE BEING BETWEEN TWO AND THREE YARDS LONG AND THE OTHER BETWEEN ONE AND TWO EVERY PART OF THE BED THAT WAS UNCOVERED WAS PERFECTLY FLAT AND HORI ZONTAL EXCEPT WHERE WE DUG FIRST THERE IT WAS BROKEN AND MDCCCXVI 0 O 75MR MORNAYS ACCOUNT OF THE DISCOVERY ACCORDING TO THE STATEMENT OF LA MOTA BOTELHO THAT WAS DONE WHEN THE BLOCK WAS REMOVED I FOUND NO TERMINATION TO THE BED IN THE DIRECTIONS OF TIE TRENCHES AND AT THE SPOT WHERE THE MASS HAD LAID IT AS ABOUT ONE FOOT THICK OR HARDLY SO MUCH BUT AT ONE END OF THE LONGER TRENCH NOT ABOVE THREE INCHES I DID NOT BRAK THROUGLH IT ANY WHERE ELSE NEARLY THE SAME LOOSE GRAVEL APPEARS UNDERNEATH THE BED AS OVER IT I BROUGHT AWAY SPECIMENS OF THE BED WHICH I CONSIDERED EXTREMELY CURIOUS SUPPOSING THEM TO CONTAIN NICKEL ON MY RETURN TO ENGLAND I TOLD YOU THEREFORE THAT I HOPED I HAD FOUND IRON ORE CONTAINING NICKEL FOR I THOUGHT THAT THE BED ON WHICH HAD RESTED THE MASS WAS ONE OF THOSE OF WHICH THERE ARE SO MANY ALL OVER THE PROVINCE BUT AS I GAVE YOU SOME SPECIMENS I WILL NOT DESCRIBE IT THE SURFACE OF THE SOIL OR RATHER COARSE GRAVEL AT THE SPOT IS ABOUT LO OR 15 FEET ABOVE THE MAIN GRANITE ROCK OF THE COUNTRY I CAN ONLY GIVE YOU AN APPROXIMATION OF THE LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE OF THE PLACE TH SUN WAS MUCH TOO HIGH AT NOON TO TAKE ITS ALTITUDE WITH A SEXTANT AND MERCURIAL HORIZON AND THE ARTIFICIAL HORIZON WHICH I HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO CONSTRUCT MYSELF OCCASIONED SUCH A LOSS OF LIGHT AS TO MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO OBSERVE THE SOUTHERN STARS FOR DETERMINING THE LATITUDE DIF FERENT ALTITUDES OF THE SUN AT A DISTANCE FROM THE MERIDIAN DID NOT GIVE ME SATISFACTORY RESULTS I HAD WITH ME AN EXCELLENT WATCH AND HAVING COMPUTED THE LATITUDE TO BE ABOUT TO EOS I CONCLUDED THE LONGITUDE TO BE 33 5 W OF BAHIA AFTER MAKING EVERY ALLOWANCE AND COMPARING THIS RESULT WITH THOSE OBTAINED BEFORE AND AFTERWARDS AT THE HOUSE OF MAJOR DANTAS CALLED CAMUCIATA NEAR ITAPICRIL  276OF A MASS OF NATIVE IRON IN BRASIL THE RAPIDITY OF GROWTH IN PLANTS IS WONDERFUL IN THE NEIGH BOURHOOD OF THE BENDEG6 ALTHOUGH THE MAIN GRANITE ROCK IS SO NEAR THE SURFACE AS TO PROTRUDE IN MANY PLACES AND WHAT LIES ON IT IS CHIEFLY A COARSE GRAVEL CONSISTING OF ROLLED FRAG MENTS OF QUARTZ FELSPAR AND GRANITE OF THE SIZE OF EGGS TOGE THER WITH SMRALLER PEBBLES AND SAND WHICH CONTAINS OF COURSE A GREAT DEAL OF MICA BUT HARDLY ANY VEGETABLE EARTH AT ABOUT 4O LEAGUES TO THE SOUTHWARD ARE FOUND HILLS OF YELLOW AND RED SAND STONE IN WHICH ORGANIC REMAINS HAVE NOT BEEN FOUND WHILE TO THE NORTHWARD THERE IS A FORMATION OF SIMILAR HILLS IN WHICH ARE OBSERVED MOST BEAUTIFUL IMPRES SIONS OF WHOLE FISHES AND REMAINS OF VEGETABLES BETWEEN THE BENDEGO AND THE SANDSTONE HILLS TO THE SOUTH WARD I OBSERVED A GREAT DEAL OF WHAT I CERTAINLY TAKE TO BE BASALT I MET WITH BALLS FROM THE DIAMETER OF TWO INCHES TO THAT OF UPWARDS OF THREE FEET AND NUMBERLESS PRISMS WITH THREE AND WITH SIX FACES SCATTERED ABOUT ALL OF THESE SMALL THAT IS TO SAY ABOUT THREE OR FOUR INCHES IN LENGTH AND TWO OR THREE IN DIAMETER TO THE SOUTHWARD OF THE SANDSTONE HILLS IS A SANDY PLAIN ALMOST BARREN EXTENDING MANY MILES PERHAPS 60 OR 8O EAST AND WEST TO THE SEA BUT NOT 20 IN BREADTH WHERE I CROSSED IT SMALL CONICAL HILLOCKS ARE SCATTERED OVER IT SOME OF WHICH THE LARGEST HAVE FLAT TOPS AND APPEAR ALL TO BE OF THE SAME HEIGHT ABOUT GO FATHOMS APPEARANCES IMPRESSED ME WITH THE IDEA THAT THEY WERE THE REMAINS OF A PLAIN WHICH FORMERLY EXTENDED OVER THE ONE ON WHICH I THEN STOOD BUT WHICH HAD BEEN WASHED AWAY IN A TUMULTUOUS MANNER BY A VIOLENT CURRENT RUNTNING NEARLY IN AN EASTERLY DIRECTION THE LARGER HILLOCKS APPEAR TO BE OO 277MR MORNAYS ACCOUNT OF THE DISCOVERY STRATIFIED BUT THEY CONSIST OF LOOSE SANDY MATERIALS EXCEPT IN SO FAR AS THEY CONTAIN BEDS OF A DARK RED IRON ORE CONTAINING IMBEDDED MINUTE CRYSTALS OF MAGNETIC IRON ORE THE THICK NESS OF THESE BEDS IS ABOUT TWO INCHES AND THEY ARE EXACTLY SIMILAR TO THOSE WHICH ARE FOUND IN THE CLAY HILLS OF BAHIA THE SMALLER HILLOCKS CONSIST OF CONFUSED HEAPS OF GRAVEL AND LOOSE STONES INTERMIXED WITH A VERY LARGE QUANTITY OF THE SAME IRON ORE IN FRAGMENTS AND LUMPS OF MANGANESE VERY COMPACT AND OF A STEEL GREY COLOUR CONTAINING ARSENIC BUT APPARENTLY NO IRON THE DREARY APPEARANCE OF THIS PLAIN IS INCREASED BY THE NUMEROUS NESTS OF CUPIM WHITE ANTS STANDING UPRIGHT LIKE SO MANY TOMBSTONES ON BEING VIEWED NEARER THEY ARE CONICAL RATHER COMPRESSED SO THAT THE BASE IS ELLIPTIC ALL THOSE WHICH I EXAMINED WERE PRECISELY OF THE SAME SHAPE THE MATERIALS OF WHICH THEY CONSIST ARE WHITE SAND WHITISH CLAY AND PARTICLES OF WOOD MANY OF THEM WERE FULL FIVE FEET IN HEIGHT THE SOIL OF THE VALLEYS AND LOW GROUNDS WHICH ARE OCCA SIONALLY SWAMPY IS ABUNDANTLY IMPREGNATED WITH SEA SALT WHICH THE INHABITANTS WASH OUT FOR THEIR OWN CONSUMPTION BUT IT CONTAINS SOME BITTER SALTS WHICH RENDER IT PURGATIVE TO THOSE WHO ARE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO IT THE THERMAL SPRINGS WHICH WERE POINTED OUT TO ME WERE SEVERAL BUT THEY HARDLY DESERVE THE NAME ONE OF THEM WAS AT 86 OF FAHRENHEIT WHEN THE ATMOS PHERE WAS AT 81 ANOTHER WAS AT 88 WHEN THE ATMOSPHERE WAS AT 77  AND ALSO AT 88 WHEN THE ATMOSPHERE WAS AT 80 THE WATER OF BOTH OF THESE IS THE PUREST I HAD EVER SEEN 78OF A MASS OF NATIVE IRON IN BRASIL G79 MANY SMALL FISH WERE SWIMMING IN THE BASIN OF THE LAST FROM WHICH RUNS AT ALL SEASONS A CONSIDERABLE RIVULET A THIRD WAS AT 9GO WHEN THE ATMOSPHERE WAS AT 73 THE WATER VERY PURE A FOURTH WAS AT O101 WHEN THE ATMOSPHERE WAS AT 85 ALSO AT LOL WHEN THE ATMOSPHERE WAS AT 93 TASTE OF THE WATER RATHER FERRUGINOUS AND VERY BRACKISH EXTREMELY DISAGREEABLE AND NAUSEOUS NO PECULIAR SMELL AND VERY TRANSPARENT ALTHOUGH IT DEPOSITS IRON AND LIME AND AN IRIDESCENT FILM IS FORMED ON ITS SURFACE CONTAINS NO SUL PHURETTED GAS THE ROCKS OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD CONTAIN PYRITES NOT MAGNETIC THIS SPRING IS CALLED THE MAIDAGOA AND IS SITUATED ON THE LEFT BANK OF THE RIVER ITAPICURI NEAR THE WATERS EDGE AT A SHORT DISTANCE FROM A PLACE CALLED THE MATODOCIP6 IT WAS DURING THIS JOURNEY THAT I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF SEE ING THAT CURIOUS PLANT CALLED CIPO DE CUNANAM IT GROWS ABUNDANTLY BETWEEN MONTE SANTO AND THE RIVER BENDEG6 IT IS A CLIMBING PLANT DESTITUTE OF LEAVES IT WAS SO WHEN I SAW IT AND I BELIEVE IT TO BE ALWAYS THE SAME IT BEARS NO THORNS BUT OFTEN GROWING SO AS TO FORM AN IMPENETRABLEPLICA WHICH THE CATTLE WILL HARDLY APPROACH MUCH LESS ATTEMPT TO BREAK THROUGH BECAUSE WHEN THE JUICE OF THIS PLANT STICKS TO THEIR HAIR IT OCCASIONS BLISTERS AND GREAT IRRITATION IT CONTAINS A MILKY JUICE AND I SUPPOSE THAT IT IS AN EUPHORBIUM WHEN I MADE A CUT AT THE BUSH WITH MY HANGER IN THE DUSK OF THE EVENING THE WOUNDS INFLICTED PRESENTED A BEAUTIFULLY LUMI NOUS LINE WHICH WAS NOT TRANSIENT BUT LASTED FOR SEVERAL SE CONDS OR A QUARTER OF A MINUTE HAVING TAKEN A PIECE OF THE PLANT I BENT IT IN THE DARK UNTIL THE SKIN CRACKED WHEN EVERY28O MR MORNAYS ACCOUNT OF THIE DISCOVERY  CRACK SHOWED THE SAME LIGHT WHICH IS OF A PHOSPHORESCENT APPEARANCE I CONTINUED TO BEND THE TWIG UNTIL THE MILKY JUICE DROPPED OUT WHEN EACH DROP WAS A DROP OF FIRE VERY MUCH LIKE WHAT I HAVE SEEN ON DROPPING INFLAMED TALLOW I DID NOT OBSERVE ANY PARTICULAR SMELL THE MILKY JUICE IS SAID TO BE VERY POISONOUS IT IS CAUSTIC AND OCCASIONS MUCH ITCHING AND IRRITATION WHEN APPLIED TO THE SKIN IT BECOMES VISCOUS IN THE AIR AND SOON DRIES OF A YELLOWISH COLOUR SLIGHTLY TINGED WITH GREEN WHEN IT HAS THE APPEARANCE OF A GUMRESIN THE ABOVE ACCOUNT CONTAINS ALL THE INFORMATION THAT I CAN GIVE YOU ON THE SUBJECT SHOULD YOU THINK IT DESERVING TO BE LAID BEFORE THE ROYAL SOCIETY I WOULD BEG OF YOU TO ADD YOUR OBSERVATIONS AS THEY WOULD RENDER THE COMMUNICATION INTE RESTING I AM WITH

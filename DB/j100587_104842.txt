PRICKLE BACK AND ALSO ON FISH IN GENERAL DEAR S I R M ANY OF MY LEISURE HOURS LAST SUMMER WERE EMPLOYED IN AT TENDING AND MAKING OBSERVATIONS ON SEVERAL KINDS OF FISH SOME WHEREOF I WITH GREAT CARE HAVE PRESERVED ALIVE IN GLASS JARS FOR MANY MONTHS TOGETHER READ FEB 5 17467 I SENT YOU SOME TIME AGO A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF WHAT I HAD OBSERVED REMARKABLE IN THE DACE AND RUFF AND AM NOW GOING TO LAY BEFORE YOU WHAT I HAVE THOUGHT WORTH NOTICE IN THAT LITTLE COMMON FISH CALLED THE PRICKLEBACK ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF LAST APRIL I TOOK A BAN SSICLE OUT OF OUR RIVER FULL OF SPAWN AND PUT IT INTO ONE OF MY GLASS JARS AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH I HAD PLACED A SMALL QUANITTY OF SAND AS I ALWAYS DO IN EVERY VESSEL WHEREIN MY FISH ARE KEPT AND ABOUT THE 20TH OF MAY IT BURIED ITS SPAWN IN THE SAID SAND I WAS IN HOPES THIS SPAWN WOULD HAVE PRO DUCED A YOUNG BROOD BUT WAS UNLUCKILY DISAPPOINTED WHICH I IMPUTE TO ITS BEING FREQUENTLY DISTURBED BY THE POURING IN OF FRESH WATER FOR SOME DAYS AFTER I HAD CATCHED THIS BANSTICLE IT REFUSED TO CAT ANY THING I COULD OFFER IT AS IS COM MON WITH ALL FISH I HAVE YET KEPT BUT FREQUENTLY GIVING425 GIVING IT FRESH WATER AND COMING OFTEN TO IT IT BE CAME SO FAMILIAR AS TO CAT SMALL WORMS I NOWAND THEN THREW INTO THE JAR AND FROM THAT TIME GREW SO TAME AS TO TAKE THEM OUT OF MY HAND NAY IT BECAME SO BOLD AT LAST THAT WHEN ITS BELLY WAS FULL OR IT DID NOT LIKE WHAT I OFFERD IT WOULD SET UP ITS PRIEKLES AND WITH ITS UTMOST STRENGTH MADE A STROKE AT MY FINGERS IF I PUT THEM INTO THE WATER TO IT THIS FISH WAS OF SO UNSOCIABLE A DISPOSITION THAT IT WOULD SUFFER NO OTHER FISH TO LIVE IN THE JAR WITH IT AND SO AUDACIOUS AS TO ATTACK WHATEVER I PUT IN THOUGH TEN TIMES ITS OWN SIZE ONE DAY FOR THE SAKE OF DIVERSION A FRIEND BE ING THEN WITH ME I PUT A SMALL RUFF INTO THE JAR TO IT WHICH THE BANSTICLE IMMEDIATELY ASSAULTED AND PUT TO FLIGHT HAVING IN THE CONFLICT TORN OFF A GOOD PART OF ITS TAIL AND WOULD I DARE SAY HAVE KILLED IT HAD I NOT SEPARATED THEM VERY SOON INFINITE NUMBERS OF THESE PRICKLEBACKS ARE TO BE FOUND IN ALMOST ALL FRESH WATERS WHEREEVER IT IS POS SIBLE FOR FISH TO LIVE AND WHATEVER OTHER KINDS THE WATER IS REPLENISHED WITH THIS CERTAINLY IS ONE AS FAR AS I HAVE YET HAD OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE ANY EN QUIRY THE ENDEAVOURS THEY USE AND THE ABILITY THEY HAVE TO GET FROM PLACE TO PLACE ARE ALSO EXTRAORDI NARY FOR THOUGH THE LARGEST OF THEM SCARCE MEASURES ABOVE TWO INCHES IN LENGTH I HAVE SEEN SOME OF THEM LEAP OUT OF THE WATER A FOOT HIGH PERPENDI CULARLY AND EVEN MUCH FURTHER IN AN OBLIQUE DI RECTION WHEN THEY WANTED TO GET OVER BOARDS OR STONES OR SOME OTHER OBSTACLE TO THEIR PASSAGE I I I 2 IT426 IT IS SCARCE TO BE CONCEIVED WHAT DAMAGE THESE LITTLE FISH DO AND HOW GREATLY DETRIMENTAL THEY ARE TO THE INCREASE OF ALL THE FISH IN GENERAL AMONGST WHOM THEY INHABIT FOR IT IS WITH THE UTMOST INDUSTRY SAGACITY AND GREEDINESS THAT THEY SEEK OUT AND DE STROY THE SPAWN OF ALL SORTS OF FISH AND MOREOVER ALL THE YOUNG FRY THAT COME IN THEIR WAY ARE PUR SUED BY THEM WITH THE UTMOST EAGERNESS AND SWAL LOWED DOWN WITHOUT DISTINCTION PROVIDED THEY ARE NOT TOO LARGE AND IN PROOF OF WHAT I HERE ASSERT I MUST ASSURE YOU THAT THE BANSTICLE BEFORE MENTIOND IN MY GLASS JAR DID ON THE 4TH OF MAY LAST DEVOUR IN FIVE HOURS TIME 74 YOUNG DACE WHICH WERE ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN INCH LONG AND THE THICKNESS OF AN HORSEHAIR TWO DAYS AFTER IT SWALLOWED 62 AND WOULD I AM PERSUADED HAVE EAT AS MANY EVERY DAY COULD I HAVE PROCURED THEM FOR IT COULD GENTLEMEN WHO TAKE PLEASURE IN FISH PONDS INTIRELY PREVENT THESE DESTROYERS FROM GETTING INTO THEM I AM CONVINCED THEIR PRODUCE WOULD BE MUCH GREATER THAN IT COMMONLY IS AND THROUGH IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO KEEP THEM OUT INTIRELY IT IS MOST CERTAINLY ADVISEABLE TO BE VERY DILIGENT IN THE DESTROYING OF THEM AND WHENEVER BY NETTING OR OTHER MEANS ANY OF THEM ARE GOT OUT OF THE WATER NEVER THROW THEM IN AGAIN ON A SUPPO SITION OF THEIR BEING HARMLESS NATURE HAS FURNISHED THIS LITTLE FISH WITH A KIND OF BREASTPLATE OR ARMOUR TO BE ITS DEFENCE AGAINST ANY OUTWARD INJURY SHE HAS LIKEWISE BESTOWED UP ON IT SEVERAL OFFENSIVE WEAPONS OR SPINES PLACED UPON ITS SIDES AND BACK WHICH IT IMMEDIATELY ERECTS427 CRECTS UPON THE LEAST APPEARANCE OF DANGER OR WHEN IT ATTACKS SOME OTHER FISH THE SHARPNESS OF THESE PRICKLES GUARDS IT WELL ENOUGH FROM LARGER ANIMALS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE PREY UPON IT BUT NEITHER THESE NOR ALL THE ENDEAVOURS IT CAN USE ARE ABLE TO FREE IT FROM AN ENEMY THAT TORMENTS IT EVEN TO DEATH WHAT I MEAN IS A KIND OF LOUSE OF AN OVAL FIGURE HAVING EIGHT LEGS AND A VERY TRANSPARENT BODY WHICH IS ABLE EITHER TO SWIM OR CRAWL AND STICKS ON IT SO FAST SUCKING AND PLAGUING IT ALL THE WHILE THAT IT MAKES IT ALMOST MAD ONE REMARKABLE PARTICULAR IN THIS LOUSE IS THAT ITS LITTLE FIBRILLOUS FINS ARE ALWAYS IN MOTION WHE THER THE CREATURE BE SWIMMING ABOUT OR FIXED UPON THE FISH ALL FISH REGULATE THEIR TIMES OF EATING AND ABS TINENCE BY THE TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR AND THE QUARTER FROM WHENCE THE WIND BLOWS AND WOULD THOSE PERSONS WHO ARE LOVERS OF ANGLING TAKE THE PAINS TO KEEP A FEW SMALL FISH IN GLASSES THEY MIGHT AT ANY TIME EASILY FORETEL FROM THEIR TAKING OR REFUSING FOOD WHAT SPORT IS TO BE EXPECTED AND OFTEN SAVE THEMSELVES MANY A WEARY STEP TAKEN TO NO PURPOSE I HAVE ALWAYS OBSERVED AMONGST THE FISH I KEEP IN JARS THAT SUCH AS HAVE LIVED A WHILE TOGETHER CON TRACT SO GREAT AN AFFECTION FOR EACH OTHER THAT IF THEY ARE SEPARATED THEY BECOME MELANCHOLY AND SUL LEN AND ARE A LONG TIME BEFORE THEY FORGET THE LOSS ABOUT CHRISTMAS LAST I PUT TWO RUFFS INTO A JAR OF WATER WHERE THEY LIVED TOGETHER UNTIL APRIL WHEN AT THE DESIRE OF A FRIEND I GAVE ONE OF THEM AWAY428 AWAY  AFTER THIS SEPARATION THE FISH THAT REMAINED WITH ME WAS SO AFFECTED THAT FOR THREE WEEKS IT WOULD EAT NOTHING I COULD GIVE IT AND THEREFORE FEARING IT  TO DEATH I SENT IT TO THE GEN TLEMAN ON WHOM I HAD BESTOWED ITS COPANIAN AND WHAT IS VERY EXTRAORDINARY UPON BEING PUT TO GETHER AGAIN IT EAT IMMEDIATELY RECOVERED ITS FORMER BRISKNESS AND BOTH OF THEM ARE STILL ALIVE I HAVE MADE ABUNDANCE OF OTHER OBSERVATIONS ON FISH BUT SHALL ONLY ADD AT PRESENT THAT WHEN THEY REMAIN SUPINE AND UNACTIVE THEY EVERY NOWANDTHEN GAPE AND YAWN AS MOST LAND ANIMALS DO WHEN WEARY OF THE SITUATION THEY ARE IN I REMAIN S I R YOURS C W ARDERON NORWICH JULY 9

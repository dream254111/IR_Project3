the artists reputation As would be ex pected in so large a series a few are indifferent but by far the greater number are remarkable for beauty fidelity and power of expression The pictures alone are worth the price of the book The typography and press work are of a high order of excellence and the publishers are to be congratulated on the exceptional skill shown by their printer in handling difficult text figures It is refreshing to find a book in the field of popular natural history which so distinctly raises the standard for its class and at the same time is offered for sale at so low a price C H M The Birds of Colorado By W W COOKE Fort Collins Colorado State Agricultural College Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin No 37 Technical Series No 2 March 1897 Pp 1143 In view of the geographical situation of Colo rado and its topographical features a recent bulletin by Professor W W Cooke of the State Agricultural College at Fort Collins is of more than usual interest It is a well annotated list of all the birds known to occur within the limits of the State Other featuresgeneral discussion historical resum6 classification of species as regards occurrence and bibliography contribute to its value Considering the opportunity which the region offers it is some what surprising that the author did not also attempt a definition and discussion of the life areas of the State The results have been derived largely from a summing up of previously published work but in addition to this much valuable new matter is included in the authors own notes and those which other observers placed at his disposal The list is a large one the number of species and subspecies attributed to the State being 363 of which 230 are breeders To those previously recorded 19 species are added This makes an enviable total but that it may still be increased is demonstrated by the outline of yet unworked territory Colorado will always be an interest 707 ing ornithological field and the present paper cannot fail to be of great service as a basis and stimulus for future work there W H OSGOOD SOCIETIES AND ACADEMIES BIOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON 280TH MEETING SATURDAY OCTOBER 23 MR F A LUCAS described A Dangerous Parasite of the Furseal stating that it was a nematode of the genus Uncinaria found in the sandy portions of the seal rookeries of the Pribilof islands and caused the death of many young seals Dr C W Stiles discussed the structure habits and life history of allied forms Dr C W Stiles spoke of  The International Committee on Zoological Nomenclature and of what had been accomplished at the meeting of 1897 Mr M B Waite presented a communicatign on A New Peach and Plum Disease caused by a species of mite attacking and killing the terminal bud of the very young trees The re sulting loss in the value of the trees was consid erable as many thousand trees would be affected in one nursery A similar disease pre vailed in the Japanese quince Mr F V Coville spoke of The History and Distribution of Abies shastensis which he had found in a recent trip through the Cascade mountains of Oregon to extend along the range north of the OregonCalifornia line as far as latitude 43 35 It has long been confounded with Abies nobilis which is however a tree of more northern distribution F A LuCAs Secretary UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN SCIENCE CLUB AT the meeting of the Club on October 15 1897 Mr H A Harding in a paper on Bac terial Plant Diseases spoke of the first dis covery by Professor Burrill of Illinois and of the tardiness with which European investiga tors recognized this work He showed the ex tent to which bacterial diseases occur especially among our garden vegetables Then followed a discussion of a disease occurring in the cauli flower and cabbage The bacteria find entrance at the waterpores of the leaf and also through NOVEMBER 5 1897708 SCIENCE insect wounds and the disease causes a black ening of the fibrovascular bundles followed by the death of the plant Mr Comstock presented an account of re search work in progress at the Washburn Obser vatory The meridian circle has been employed for some years by Mr Flint in determining the relative parallaxes of a list of stars selected with reference to large proper motion The observa tions for the determination of nearly 100 paral laxes are completed and the reductions are well advanced although but a small number of de finitive results have yet been reached In so far as these have been obtained they are very satis factory in respect both of probable error and agreement with other determinations There was also described work done with the 40 cm equatorial telescope in investigations of stellar color and upon the density of the supposed lunar atmosphere A provisional re sult of the latter work is that this density can not exceed one fivethousandth part of that of the earths atmosphere at sea level WM S MARSHALL Secretary SCIENTIFId JOURNALS The American Journal of

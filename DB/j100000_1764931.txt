Sczence of Nov I8 I887 Those who heard or have read Professor Trowbridges paper will remember that it reported the discovery by his son of a peculiar structure in the primary wingfeathers of soaring birds by which they are locked when ex panded and are thus maintained in position without muscular effort This structure is shown only in the primary feathers and is therefore a character belonging to the last division of the arm Professor Wyman in the note referred to describes  a peculiar arrangement of the bones and ligaments in the wing of the pin tailed duck by which while the wing is fully extended all the seg ments of this extremity are fixed and retained in position independ tently of muscular action His account of the mechanism of the wing is as follows  The structure of the articulations of the elbow and wrist is such that during flexion and extension the radius advances and recedes upon the ulna carrying with it the upper carpal bone and this last the hand in this way flexion and extension of the bones are effected Thelower carpal bone is attached to the upper by strong ligaments consequently when the upper carpal bone is drawn over the extremity of the uina as the radius recedes the lower one is drawn up between the hand and the extremity of the ulna sand acting as a wedge maintains the hand extended until it is dis placed by the reversed action of the radius This structure ac cordina to Professor Wyman shows how the extension of the bony framework of the wing may be maintained indefinitely without fatigue Thestructure of the primary wingfeathers described by Irofessor Trowbridge indicates that they too may be locked in wposition and thus the rigidity of the wing may be maintained auto matically to its extremity None of the members of the National Academy who took part in the discussion which followed the reading of Professor Trow bridges paper seemed to have any knowledge of this discovery of Professor Wyman and it was remarked that while the facts cited tby Professor Trowbridge seemed to explain the automatic exten sion of the primaries which are appendages of the onanvs the rigidity of the arm itself apparently manifested in the flight of soar Xing birds wasyet unaccounted for That missing link was sup plied by Professor Wyman but from his characteristic modesty so quietly announced that it has been known to few The case cited by me at the meeting of the National Academy was a turkeybuzzard shot when soaring over the prairies in the ZSacramento valley Its wings remained rigidly extended and it descended slowly like a parachute and settled in the grass very Anear me quite dead even then the wings remaining expanded Professor Storer gives other interesting examples He says 6 Upon the New England seaboard nothing is more familiar to old gunners than the phenomenon that a bird shot in midairwill often 6 set his wings and scale down toward the horizon to reach the water dead often at a great distance from the boat whence the shot was fired Even in childhood I remembered to have won dered when  assisting  at the shooting of duck and coot as to the meaning of the not infrequent exclamation That fellow has set this wings watch him    Dr Storer writes that he was present at the meeting of the Bos ton Natural History Society Sept I I855 when Professor Wyman exhibited his preparation of the ducks wing and gave an explana tion of its structure which seemed a demonstration Now if some good anatomist would review the subject again combine the results reached by Professor Wyman and Professor Trowbridge and illustrate his memoir with good figures he would make an important contribution to biological science J S NEWBERRY iNew Yorkn Dec IO The Origin of the Tritubercular Type of Mammalian Dentition PROFESSOR COPE has fully demonstrated that the molar teeth f many divisions of the higher mammalia are derived from the tritubercular type of molar which is so abundant in the mammals of the Puerco or lowest eocene period He has further  Origin iof the Fittest p 347 shown that the tritubercuar type may be traced back to the single cone of the reptilian crown by the follow  ing succession  first a simple cone or reptilian crown alternating z with that of the other jaw second a cone with lateral denticles 1 third the denticles to the inner side of the crown forming a three r sided prism with tritubercular apex which alternates with that of the opposite jaw etc In the last meeting of the American Asso ciation for the Advancement of Science Professor Cope applied this L succession to the origin of what he has called the s tubercularsec torial  molar citing the molars of Owens genus 55aAcgcoMerzzm as an instance of the transformation into the tritubercular crown zn  5rocess I had independently arrivecl at the same conclusion and moreover found that the origin of the tritubercular crown in all its various stages could be traced in the mesosoic mammalia This is traced in a memoir now publishing by the Philadelphia Acad emy I am glad to be able to confirm Professor Copes views in every particular for his numerous and suggestive papers upon the mechanical genesis of tooth forms have placed comparative anato mists generally in his debt Among the mesozoic mammalia the simple large cone with small lateral denticles is seen in the Ameri cantriassic genus ZeosnoSerivon From the same beds Mzcro conodon furnishes a more advanced stage in the growth of the lat eral denticles into cusps The mandibles of Jurassic genera PAascoZoZherguwn Menacodon SpZacoMerzvm furnish three stages of the rotation inwards of the lateral cusps accompanied probably by the rotation outwards of the lateral cusps in the upper jaw In SfyZodon this process is complete the teeth being dis tinctly tritubercular with the addition of a posterior heel the upper molars resersing the pattern of the lower In another line of gen era the lateral cusps show no tendency to rotate inwards but con tinually augment in size such as Trzvorsodon and its successors leading to the modern Zhylacznxs type of molar In 24ZfiAzZZe rzum and many other genera it appears as if the posterior lateral cusp had never been acquired and the crown is reenforced by the inward extension of the cingulum as seen in an early stage in DAocynodon In KvrZodon by the union of the external tuber cles in the upper jaw we observe a columnar molar of the rodent type It now appears as if we should soon be in possession of sufficient data to trace the entire history of the multicuspid and multifanged mammalian molar from the single reptilian cone and fang  HENRY F OSBORN Princeton NJ Dec I2 Iroquois and Eskimos IN connection with the dicussion which has recently appeared in Sczence on the ancient relations of the Iroquois and Eskimos a passage which I recently came across in the manuscripts of the Moravian missionary Christopher Pyrlseus is worthy of note The active work of Pyrlceus was between I740 and I750 and he became anaccomplished scholar in one or more of the Iroquois dialects In July I749 the Iroquois sent a deputation to a council at Philadelphia when Pyrlaeus acted as interpreter In his notes of his conversations with the deputies he has the following  TscAzechrohne heissen die Gronlander    Tschie ein See hund Die drei obgenannte Seneker wussten nicht nur von den Gronlandern sondern auch ihrer Contry szc Landsart Kleidung Nahrung etc Of course Pyrlaeus used the term  Greenlanders as generic for  Eskimos Evidently the Iroquois who pushed their war parties to the south as far as the present State of Louisiana carrled their excursions also as far north as the shores of the Frozen Ocean D G BRINTON Medias Penn Dec 7 The Sioux IN your issue of Nov 25 p 264 your correspondent from

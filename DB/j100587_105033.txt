right honourable the Lord Kingston of Queenssquare per mitted me to take a drawing and this description of the little monkey which you and the reverend Dr Stukeley saw a few days ago Its particular charac ters joind to its very small size induced me to think it a subject worthy the notice of the Royal Society especially too as there is yet no good figure of it ex hibited Read April 18 1751 It is from the tip of the nose to the root of the tail upon the edge of the spine but seven inches and an half and the tail from its root to the extremity is nine inches its face about an inch long and hardly three quarters of an inch broad at the eyes where it is broadest Its utmost weight is about four ounces and an half averdupoise The face is naked and of a fleshcolour the eyes black having no white part visible the ears are thin large in proportion and of a dark colour and are surrounded each with a grove of very white hairs between which the hairs of the neck are blackish and so are the four extremities the rest of the body and tail is a mixture of dusky and yellow so as to compose a dark olive the hairs of the body are 4 exceedinglyPhilosTrans Vol XLVII TAB VII p 146 1 Parsons MD del J Myndc sc147 exceedingly soft and upon closely examining them each hair is particolourd that is dusky at the root then a little yellowish then dark and then yellowish again somewhat like the soft feathers of partridges The fingers are slender each having three joints they are five on each extremity and are pointed by nails rather resembling the claws of birds than those of human bodies which is common to most other species of the cercopitheci I since waited on Mr Hyde of Charterhouse square who shewd me another of these which happens to be the male of this very species now de scribed and seems about one size larger than my lords being about eight inches measured by a pack thread from the nose to the root of the tail and from thence the tail is about ten inches long It weighs about six ounces and a quarter is very slender like the female and with some difficulty moves his pos terior extremities but they seem always better in warm weather and more active than in winter be ing scarce able to bear cold The same gentleman gave me besides an account of the following particulars relating to it This and a female which is since dead were brought by an EastIndia ship about two years ago from Brasile having occasionally touchd there in its return from the Indies which shews Brasile to be the native place of these animals And as Mr Hyde has had his monkey nowtwo years these may be reasonably supposed at their full growth and perhaps the males are commonly somewhat larger than the females as it is in some other animals They are both very thin and spare and of the same colour in every respect T 2 except148 except that there are more downy white hairs on the male than on the female the marks and features are the same in both their voices are small and shrill and they are alike in all other respects but the sex and altho the claws are like those of a bird having hooked nails pointed at the end of every fin ger of the upper extremities the thumb of each in ferior extremity in male and female is flat like the human and has a flat nail Mr Hyde feeds his monkey sometimes with roasted chesnuts sometimes in summer with sweet fruits as gooseberries when thorough ripe plums cherries and suchlike but he will not touch currants be cause of their acidity He seems very fond of the smaller spiders and their eggs but not the larger sorts nor will he touch the great bluebottle fly tho he greedily eats the small common flies He frequently has a diarrhaea and once by accident it was found that he seemd to love a gum calld gum senega which he feeds on with eagerness and it never fails to cure him so that he gives it to him now only occasionally Another kind of diet which I saw him eat was young snails of which he eats three a day I have chosen the figure of the male to be engraved for the Transactions put into such an attitude as will best shew the penis and scrotum They are placed nearly in the same situation with those of a dog but most resemble those of human nature being naked of hair having a fair soft fleshcolourd skin very tender and taper towards the end of the penis which is altogether as prominent from the body as the hu man The feminine part of generation of this species consists149 consists of a fleshcolourd naked piece a little raised having a hole in the middle and situated backwards between the femora not quite so far as the pudenda of the females of other small quadrupeds This sir is the species of monkey mentiond by Marcgravius in the fifth chapter of the sixth book of his Historia rerum naturalium c where he treats of the quadrupeds and serpents of Brasile but his figure bears so little resemblance to the creature and his description is so short that I believe you will think this farther history not unnecessary however I have transcribed his words as follow to shew that this animal is the same that he describes  Cagui or sagui minor tenerum animalculum et  parvum leonem quoque facie referens Totius corpo  ris

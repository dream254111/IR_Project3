FROM BRASILE HAVING OCCASIONALLY TOUCHD THERE IN ITS RETURN FROM THE INDIES WHICH SHEWS BRASILE TO BE THE NATIVE PLACE OF THESE ANIMALS AND AS MR HYDE HAS HAD HIS MONKEY NOWTWO YEARS THESE MAY BE REASONABLY SUPPOSED AT THEIR FULL GROWTH AND PERHAPS THE MALES ARE COMMONLY SOMEWHAT LARGER THAN THE FEMALES AS IT IS IN SOME OTHER ANIMALS THEY ARE BOTH VERY THIN AND SPARE AND OF THE SAME COLOUR IN

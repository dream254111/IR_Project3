J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1076363,THE NEED OF INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION,I244641,DISCUSSION COUNTER THE SALESMAN HAD THE DIFFICULT TASK OF SATISFYING A PURCHASER WHO MADE UP HER MIND THAT SHE DID NOT WANT THE GOODS WHICH SHE HAD SELECTED FIRST ALTHOUGH THE PIECE HAD BEEN CUT FROM THE WEB IN ANOTHER SALE THE CUSTOMER WISHED A PARTICULAR COLOR IN A KIMONA BUT WAS UNABLE TO FIND IT SHE WAS FINALLY SATISFIED WITH SOMETHING SHE HAD NOT AT FIRST INTENDED TO BUY THE FOURTH SALE WAS MADE TO A GENTLEMAN WHO HAD CONCEIVED THE WHIMSICAL IDEA OF SURPRISING HIS WIFE BY TAKING A DRESS HOME TO HER THE TEACHING OF SALESMANSHIP IN OUR SCHOOL IS STILL IN THE EXPERIMENTAL STAGE AND THIS DISCUSSION CAN DO LITTLE MORE THAN PRESENT THE GENERAL PLAN OF THE WORK WE CANNOT YET POINT TO DEFINITE RESULTS WHICH JUSTIFY ALL THE ATTEMPTS WE ARE MAKING THE WORK HOWEVER GIVES THE BOY CONFIDENCE IN HIMSELF IT INCREASES HIS RESOURCEFULNESS BY PLACING BEFORE HIM A DEFINITE SET OF PROBLEMS WHICH HE STUDIES WITH THE AID OF EXPERIENCED MEN IT BRINGS HIM INTO CLOSE CONTACT WITH SUCCESSFUL SALESMEN WHO AROUSE HIS ENTHUSIASM AND GIVE HIM IDEALS TOWARD WHICH TO WORK THIS SPIRIT OF ENTHUSIASM IS PERHAPS OF NO LESS BENEFIT TO HIM THAN THE KNOWLEDGE OF MAXIMS AS TO WHAT HE SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT DO LEONARD B MOULTON THE HIGH SCHOOL OF COMMERCE BOSTON THE NEED OF INDUSTRIAL EDUCATIONI PINEHURST NC NOVEMBER 7 I9II THE PRESIDENT COMMERCIAL CLUB OF CHICAGO SIR IT IS WITH SINCERE REGRET THAT I FIND MYSELF UNABLE TO KEEP THE ENGAGE MENT WHICH I MADE TO MEET THE COMMERCIAL CLUB MY REGRET IS DOUBLY KEEN ON ACCOUNT OF THE SUBJECT WHICH YOU PROPOSE TO DISCUSS YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU IN THE SUBJECT OF INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION A MATTER WHICH IN MY OPINION IS OF FUNDAMENTAL VALUE TO OUR NATIONAL LIFE AND TO THE WELFARE OF THE ONCOMING GENERATIONS I DO NOT MAKE THAT STATEMENT LIGHTLY BUT AS A DELIBERATE CON CLUSION AFTER AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CONSIDERING THE SUBJECT FROM TWO POINTS OF VIEW I HAVE LOOKED AT THE MATTER FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE MECHANIC APPREN TICE ALTHOUGH EVEN IN MY SHOP DAYS THE TIME OF THOROUGH APPRENTICESHIP WAS PASSING AS IT IS NOW PRACTICALLY ALTOGETHER PASSED AND I HAVE STUDIED IT IN THE LIGHT OF A FAIRLY CAREFUL INSPECTION OF THE EDUCATIONAL METHODS AND RESULTS THAT ARE MAKING SUCH MARKED IMPRESS ON THE SOCIAL LIFE OF SOME OF THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES I BELIEVE NO MAN CAN HAVE EXPERIENCED AT FIRST HAND EITHER THE LACK IN THIS COUNTRY OF EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES ADAPTED TO INDUSTRIAL LIFE OR HAVE STUDIED INTELLIGENTLY THE FACILITIES OF THIS CHARACTER WHICH SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE NOW OFFERING WITHOUT A SHOCK TO HIS TRADITIONAL AMERICAN COM PLACENCY OR WITHOUT REACHING THE CONCLUSION AS I HAVE THAT OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM MUST BE MARKEDLY DEVELOPED BEFORE IT WILL MEET PRESENTDAY CONDITIONS WE HAVE GROWN USED TO REGARDING AMERICA AS A LAND OF UNEQUALED RESOURCES I READ AT A MEETING OF THE COMMERCIAL CLUB OF CHICAGO NOVEMBER II I9II 59THE SCHOOL REVIEW BUT AFTER ALL NO NATION NO MATTER WHAT ITS NATURAL RESOURCES OF FIELD MINE AND FOREST MAY BE CAN BE GREATER THAN THE INTELLIGENCE THE EFFICIENCY AND THE CAPACITY OF ITS PEOPLE IN THE BEST TRAINING OF THOSE QUALITIES WE ARE UNQUES TIONABLY LAGGING WE HAVE PUT GREAT EMPHASIS IN THE LAST FEW YEARS UPON THE CONSERVATION OF OUR NATURAL RESOURCES BUT IN THAT MOVEMENT WE HAVE IT SEEMS TO ME FAILED TO TAKE INTO FULL ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT THE GREATEST NATURAL RESOURCE OF EVERY NATION MUST ALWAYS BE THE LATENT CAPACITIES OF ITS YOUTH WITHOUT THE BEST DEVELOPMENT OF THOSE CAPACITIES THE CONSERVATION OF OTHER RESOURCES CAN MEAN BUT LITTLE I BELIEVE WE HAVE BEEN NEGLECTING THE WORK THAT IS REALLY MORE IMPORTANT TO DO THAN ANY OF THE OTHER WORK THAT WE HAVE BEEN COUNTING AS SO VALUABLE TO OUR NATIONAL LIFE WHILE THE BASIC CONDITIONS OF OUR SOCIAL LIFE HAVE BEEN CHANGED WE HAVE STOOD STILL ON THE LIFELONG THEORY THAT THE AIM OF EDUCATION IS ITS CULTURAL VALUE THERE WAS A DAY WHEN THIS CULTURAL EDUCATION ADEQUATELY AND PROPERLY SUPPLE MENTED THE EDUCATION WHICH WAS SO WELL GIVEN BY THE DAILY LIFE OF THE YOUTH INTIMATELY RELATED AS THAT DAILY LIFE WAS TO THE INDUSTRIAL LIFE OF THE TIMES BUT WHILE INDUSTRIAL CONDITIONS CHANGED AND THE DAILY ROUTINE WAS ROBBED OF ITS EDUCATIONAL VALUE WE HAVE CONTINUED STUBBORNLY TO STAND ON THE CUL TURAL THEORY OF EDUCATION INSTEAD OF ENLARGING AND ENRICHING OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM TO COMPENSATE FOR THE LOSS IN EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY WHICH COMES WITH THE CHANGE IN OUR INDUSTRIAL SURROUNDINGS HOWEVER TENACIOUSLY ONE MAY CLING TO THE CULTURAL THEORY OF EDUCATION HE MUST ADMIT AT LEAST THAT IN A SYSTEM WHICH RETAINS LESS THAN ONEHALF THE PUPILS IN SCHOOL BEYOND THIRTEEN YEARS OF AGE AND WHERE SIXTY OUT OF EVERY HUNDRED ENROLLED NEVER COMPLETE THE WHOLE PUBLIC COURSE THERE MUST BE SOME THING LACKING AN IRRESISTIBLE CONCLUSION IT SEEMS TO ME IS THAT THE LACK LIES IN THE INFLEXIBILITY OF A SYSTEM THAT HAS FAILED TO PROVIDE WHAT A CHANGED SOCIAL LIFE DEMANDS THE COMMERCIAL CLUB HAS DONE A NATIONWIDE SERVICE IN MAKING A STUDY OF EUROPEAN ACHIEVEMENTS IN INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION AFTER HEARING THE RESULTS OF THAT STUDY I CANNOT BUT BELIEVE THAT YOU WILL BE CONVINCED OF THE EFFICIENCY OF THE SYSTEM BUT AS YOU LEARN OF THE MULTIPLICITY OF EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS THERE OF THE ALMOST INCREDIBLE VARIETY OF SCHOOLS WHICH HAVE BEEN CREATED TO MEET THE VARIETY OF TRAINING DEMANDED BY MODERN INDUSTRIAL LIFE IT WILL BE SMALL WONDER IF THE PROSPECTIVE COST OF SUCH ENLARGEMENT AND ENRICHMENT OF OUR PUBLICSCHOOL SYSTEM DOES NOT RAISE THOSE TWO QUESTIONS WHICH ARE THE TOUCH STONE OF THE BUSINESS MIND WHAT WILL IT COST  WILL IT PAY  ADEQUATELY TO DEVELOP OUR PUBLICSCHOOL SYSTEM SO AS TO BRING IT INTO FULL HARMONY WITH THE DEMANDS OF MODERN INDUSTRIAL LIFE WILL COST MORE THAN MOST OF YOU WILL DREAM MORE THAN ANY OF YOU WOULD GUESS IF YOU HAVE NO CLEAR CONCEPTION OF THE TREMENDOUS GAP THERE IS BETWEEN OUR PRESENT EDUCA TIONAL PERFORMANCE AND A REALLY ADEQUATE SYSTEM IN FULL HARMONY WITH MODERN NEEDS BUT THAT COST I SHOULD REGARD NOT AS A GREAT NATIONAL EXPENSE BUT AS THE WISEST SORT OF NATIONAL INVESTMENT AS I LEFT NEW YORK LAST WEEK THERE 60DISCUSSION 6I LAY IN THE HUDSON ONE HUNDRED AND SIX SHIPS OF WAR OUR PRIDE IN THEIR EFFI CIENCY LEADS US ALMOST TO FORGET THEIR COST THOUGH WE KNOW THAT THAT WHOLE GREAT NAVY WILL BE JUNK IN BUT A FEW YEARS NECESSARY AS THIS CONSTANTLY RENEWED NAVY MAY BE HOWEVER ITS GREATEST GUNS MUST BE SILENT AND IMPOTENT IN THE REAL WAR THE WAR OF NATIONAL EFFICIENCY WHICH WE MUST FIGHT WHETHER WE WILL OR NOT NO PEACE TRIBUNAL CAN SAVE US FROM THAT WAR AND ON OUR ABILITY TO FIGHT IT WELL MUST HANG OUR NATIONAL FUTURE AND OUR INDIVIDUAL WELFARE EVERY THOROUGHLY EQUIPPED AND INTELLIGENTLY MANAGED INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL WILL BE A BATTLESHIP IN THAT WAR EVERY CONTINUATION SCHOOL THAT OFFERS SCIENTIFIC EDUCATION TO THE EMPLOYED YOUTH WILL BE A CRUISER THAT WILL CARRY TRAINED FOREMEN TO INDUSTRIES THAT MUST HAVE THE GENERALSHIP OF RIGHT DIRECTION SUCH A SYSTEM WILL BRING TRAINED RECRUITS TO OUR INDUSTRIAL ARMIES WITHOUT WHOM WE SHALL LOSE MANY BATTLES YES THE COST WILL BE GREAT BUT IT IS A CAPITAL EXPENDITURE IT WILL BE AN INVESTMENT PROMISING A RETURN GREATER THAN HAS ANY TRUTHFUL PROSPECTUS OF ANY ENTERPRISE THAT HAS EVER COME WITHIN YOUR BUSINESS EXPERIENCE VERY TRULY YOURS F A VANDERLIP

J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107297,ON THE CHANGES PRODUCED IN ATMOSPHERIC AIR AND OXYGEN GAS BY RESPIRATION,I206963,XVI ONTHE ECHANGES PRODUCEA IN ATMOSPHERIC AIR ANDOXYGEN GASBY RESPIRATON BY W ALLEN ESQ F R S AND W HI PEPYS ESQ  R S READ JUNE 16TH 1808O 1T HE PROCESS OF RESPIRATION OR BREATHING IS SO INTIMATELY CON NECTED WITH OUR EXISTENCE IN LIFE THAT FROM ITS FIRST MOMENTS TO THE FINAL CLOSE SLEEPING AND WAKING THIS NECESSARY ACTION IS CONSTANTLY MAINTAINED NOR CAN IT BE SUSPENDED EVEN FOR A FEW MINUTES WITHOUT CONSIDERABLE PAIN AND THE UTMOST DANGER THIS IMPORTANT PROCESS HAS OF COURSE EXCITED THE CURIOSITY BOTH OF ANCIENT AND MODERN PHILOSOPHERS AMONG THE LATTER WE FIND THE DISTINGUISHED NAMES OF MAYOW PRIESTLEY GOODWIN MENZIES SPALLANZANISCHEELE LAVOISIER AND DAVY WHOSE SUCCESSIVE LABOURS HAVE THROWN GREAT LIGHT UPON THIS DIFFICULT SUBJECT AND PREPARED THE WAY FOR FARTHER INVESTIGATION BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE A REVIEW OF WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE WITHOUT PERCEIVING THAT SOME IMPORTANT POINTS WERE BY NO MEANS SATISFACTORILY SETTLED AN ACCURATE METHOD OF SEPARA TING THE DIFFERENT GASSES AND ASCERTAINING THEIR EXACT PROPORTION IN ANY GIVEN MIXTURE WAS STILL A DESIDERATUM WHEN MANY OF THE EXPERIMENTS WERE MADE AND IT IS ONLY OF LATE YEARS THAT EUDIOMETRY HAS ATTAINED ITS PRESENT PERFECTION THE QUANTITY OF RESIDUAL GAS IN THE LUNGS AFTER A FORCED EXPIRATION WAS A MATTER IN DISPUTE AMONOG FORMER EXPERIMENTERS SOME MAKING IT ONE HUNDRED AND NINE CUBIC INCHES AND OTHERS ONLY FORTY M7DCCCV11 K K2O ISS IL N AD PI ON THE CHANGES PRODUCED IN AND YET IT IS OF THE UTMOST CONSEQUENCE IL ALL CALCULATIONS UPON THE EFFCTS PRODUCED ESPECIALLY UPON SMALL PORTIONS OF GAS THAT THE STATE OF THE LUNGS SHOULD BE ACCURATELY DETER MINED THIS CONSTITUTES THE GREAT DIFFICULTY IN THE INVESTIGA TIONS WE THEREFORE COMMENCED OUR LABOURS BY CONSTRUCTING AN APPARATUS IN WHICH WE ARE ABLE TO RESPIRE FROM THREE TO FOUR THOUSAND CUBIC INCHES OF GAS CONCEIVING THAT IN THIS QUANTITY THE ERROR ARISING FROM THE RESIDUAL GAS IN THE LUNGS MUST BE SO MUCH OBVIATED AS TO PERMIT THE MOST SATISFACTORY RESULTS THE APPARATUS CONSISTS OF THREE GASOMETERS TWO OF WHICH ARE FILLED WITH MERCURY AND ONE WITH DISTILLED WATER THE WATER GASOMETER WHICH BELONGS TO THE ROYAL INSTITU TION IS CAPABLE OF HOLDING FOUR THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED CUBIC INCHES OF GAS AND EACH OF THE MERCURIAL ONES THREE HUNDRED CUBIC INCHES THE APPARATUS WAS SO ARRANGED THAT THE INSPI RATIONS WERE ALL MADE FROM THE WATER GASOMETER AND THE EXPIRATIONS INTO THE MERCURIAL GASOMETERS ALTERNATELY EACH OF THE GASOMETERS IS FURNISHED WITH A GRADUATED SCALE AND THEY ARE ALL MADE TO RANGE WITH EACH OTHER SO THAT THE QUANTITY OF GAS INSPIRED AND EXPIRED COULD BE IMMEDIATELY AND EXACTLY ASCERTAINED TO EACH OF THE MERCURIAL GASOMETERS A GLASS TUBE IS FIXED AND MADE TO ENTER A MERCURIAL BATH FROM WHICH PORTIONS OF THE EXPIRED AIR COULD AT ANY TIME BE TAKEN FOR EXAMINATION BY THE KINDNESS OF OUR FRIEND SILVANUS BEVAN WE ARE ENABLED TO GIVE AN ACCURATE DRAWING OF THE APPARATUSI  1  L I I I  I TJ 2  V H I H R F2  I I   V I 1  ITMOSPHERICIR A TDD OYG GAS BY

APPARATUS WERE PERFECTLY AIRTIGHT AND THIS FROM THE NATURE OF IT WAS VERY EASILY ASCERTAINED WE AGREED THAT THE BREATH ING SHOULD ALWAYS BE PERFORMED BY ONE OF US AND THE REGIS TERING C BY THE OTHER AS EACH WOULD BY THAT MEANS ACQUIRE A GREATER DEGREE OF DEXTERITY IN PERFORMING HIS PART AND THE RESULTS WOULD BE MORE UNIFORM THE WATER GASOMETER BEING FILLED WITH COMMON AIR TO A CERTAIN MARK UPON

MADE TO PASS FROM THE FATER GASOMETER THROUGL THE LUNGS OF THE OPERATOR INTO THE MERCURIAL GASOMETER AND THIS WITH GREAT EASE AS THE DIA METERS OF THE TUBES WERE PURPOSELY MADE LARGE THE SCALE OF THE MERCURIAL GASOMETER WAS CAREFULLY NOTICED AND WHEN NEARLY FULL THE COCK 4 UNDERNEATH WAS SHUT OFF THEN BY A SIGNAL FROML THE OPERATOR HIS COLLEAGUE OPENED 3 AND THE EX PIRATIONS WERE RECEIVED IN G 2

BREATHING IN THESE CASES WAS AS NEARLY NATURAL AS WE CONCEIVE IT POSSIBLE TO BE IN ANY APPARATUS THE OPERATOR WAS SCARCELY FATIGUED AND HIS PULSE NOT RAISED MORE THAN ABOUT ONE BEAT IN A MINUTE THE RESPIRATIONS HOWEVER WERE DEEPER AND FEWER THAN NATURAL AMOUNTING ONLY TO ABOUT 58 IN ELEVEL MINUTES WHEREAS FROM REPEATED OBSERVATIONS AT DIFFERENT AND DISTANT TIMES HE MAKES 19 IN A MINUTE THE SMALLNESS OF THE DEFICIENCY SURPRISED US VERY MUCH AS FROM THE REPORTS OF OTHER EXPERIMENTERS WE HAD BEEN PREPARED TO EXPECT A MUCH GREATER LOSS IT MIGHT BE OBJECTED THAT THE AIR WAS RAREFIED BY PASSING THROUGH THE LUNGS BUT THIS WAS ALMOST IMME DIATELY COUNTERACTED BY THE MASS OF QUICKSILVER IN THE GASO METERS WHICH AMOUNTED AT LEAST TO ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS AND WE HAVE REPEATEDLY NOTICED THAT AIR UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES HAS SUFFERED NO PERCEPTIBLE DIMINUTION BY STAND ING FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME IN ONE CASE IN WHICH AIR FROMS 5 MESSRS  ALTEN AND PEPYS ON THE CHANGES PROADUED IN THE LUNGS WAS DRIVEN INTO THE MERCURIAL GASOMETERS FOR TWENTYSEVEN MINUTES THE TEMPERATURE OF THE QUICKSILVER AT THE END OF THE EXPERIMENT WAS NOT RAISED HALF A DEGREE OF FAHRENHEITS THERMOMETER THE DEFICIENCY IN OUR OPINION PRINCIPALLY ARISES FROM THE DIFFICULTY IN BRINGING THE LUNGS PRECISELY TO THE SAME STATE AFTER AS BEFORE THE EXPERIMENT AND IT MUST BE RECOLLECTED THAT THE OPERATOR COMMENCED BY A FORCIBLE EXPIRATION INTO THE OPEN AIR BUT FINISHED BY A FORCIBLE EXPIRATION INTO THE MERCURIAL GASOMETER NOW ALTHOUGH THIS GASOMETER WAS COUNTERPOISED BY WEIGHTS IN THE SCALE AT TACHED TO IT YET WE CAN EASILY CONCEIVE THAT MORE RESISTANCE MIGHT BE AFFORDED TO THE COMPLETE EVACUATION IN THE LATTER CASE THAN IN THE FORMER AND CONSEQUENTLY THE LUNGS MIGHT CONTAIN A FEW INCHES MORE AFTER THE EXPERIMENT THAN BEFORE IT WHICH MIGHT IN SOME MEASURE ACCOUNT FOR THE DEFICIENCY IN THE ELEVENTH EXPERIMENT PORTIONS OF GAS WERE TAKEN OFF FROM EACH OF THE MERCURIAL GASOMETERS AS THEY WERE

IN THE SOCIETYS TRANSAC TIONS FOR 1807 IN WHICH ONE CUBIC INCH IS DIVIDED INTO ONE HUNDRED PARTS  AND THAT IN ALMOST EVERY INSTANCE WE MADE TWO AND SOMETIMES THREE EXPERIMENTS ON THE SAME GAS

NECESSARY TO INSURE ACCURACY ONE HUNDRED PARTS OF THLE EXPIRED GAS BEING AGITATED WITH LIME WATER IN THE EUDIOMETER THE LIME WATER BECAME TUR BID AND 85 PARTS OF THE GAS WERE ABSORBED WHICH WERE CONSEQUENTLY CARBONIC ACID THE REMAINING 915 PARTS WERE TREATED WITH THE GREEN SULPHATE OF IRON SATURATED WITH NITROUS GAS AS RECOMMENDED BY PROFESSOR DAVY AND AFTERWARDS WITH THE SIMPLE SOLUTION OF THE GREEN SULPHATE WHEN 125 PARTS WERE ABSORBED WHICH WERE CONSEQUENTLY OXYGEN AND THE REMAINING 79 AZOTE LOO PARTS OF THE EXPIRED GAS THEREFORE CONSISTED OF 85 CARBONIC ACID 1O5 OXYGEN 79 AZOTE 100

29214 CUBIC INCHES OF CARBONIC ACID GAS WERE GIVEN OFF IN ELEVEN MINUTES OR 2655 CUBIC INCHES PER MINUTE WHICH IS ALMOST EXACTLY THE ESTIMATE OF PROFESSOR DAVY IN THIS EXPERIMENT THE OPERATOR INSPIRED 3460 CUBIC INCHES IN ELEVEN MINUTES AND FELT HIMSELF IN A NATURAL STATE WHEN HE LEFT OFF THEN AS HE MAKES USUALLY UNDER COMMON CIRCUM STANCES NINETEEN RESPIRATIONS IN A MINUTE 346O 0 11 X 19 209 3460

WITH A REMARKABLE FACT VIZ THAT AS MUCH CARBONIC ACID GAS WAS GIVEN OFF IN 5 MINUTES AS IN THE FORMER EXPERIMENT IN ELEVEN MINUTES SO THAT IT APPEARS WHENEVER ATMOSPHERIC AIR IS TAKEN INTO THE LUNGS IT RETURNS CHARGED WITH ABOUT 8 PER CENT CARBONIC ACID THE FASTER RE SPIRATION IS PERFORMED THE MORE CARBONIC ACID IS GIVEN OFF AND CONASEENTLY THE MORE OXYGEN CONSUMED IN THIS INSTANCE IT MAS GIVEN OFF AT THE RATE OF FIFTYONE CUBIC INCHES PER MINUTE THIRTEENTH EXPERIMENT WE NOW PROCEEDED TO CARRY ON THE RESPIRATION OF COMMON AIR FOR A MUCH LONGER PERIOD THAN USUAL AND OF COURSE ON A MNUCH LARGER QUANTITY THE EXPERIMENT WAS MADE BY THE SAME OPERATOR WHO HAD PERFORMED ALL THE OTHERS EXCEPT THE 12TH ELEVEN MERCURIAL GASOMETERS HAVING BEEN FILLED TAKEN OFF AND REGISTERED THE OPERATOR CONTINUED TO BREATHE IN THE ITH UNTIL A MARK WAS MADE BY HIS COLLEAGUE UPON THE SCALE MDCCVIILR L I58 MESSRS ALLEN AND PPY ON THE CHANGES PRODUCED IN OF THE WATER GASOMETER AND IT WAS AGAIN FILLED WITH COMMON AIR TO THE USUAL DIVISION ON THE SCALE THIS OCCUPIED BUT A VERY SHORT SPACE OF TIME THE OPERATOR WITHOUT TAKING HIS LIPS FROM THE TUBE THEN FILLED TWELVE MORE OF THE MERCURIAL GASOMETERS WHICH WERE REGISTERED AS BEFORE AND HE CONTI NUED TO BREATHE IN THE 12TH UNTIL THE WATER GASOMETER WAS AGAIN REPLENISHED ELEVEN MORE WERE THEN FILLED AND PORTIONS SAVED FROM EACH THE EXPERIMENT WAS COMPLETED BY

HAVE GONE ON FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME THE SMALLNESS OF THE DEFICIENCY NOTWITHSTANDING THE EX PERIMENTS OCCUPIED E24 MINUTES IS A STRIKING CIRCUMSTANCE AND LEADS US TO SUSPECT STILL MORE STRONGLY THAT THE DEFICIENCY PRINCIPALLY ARISES FROM THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF ALWAYS BRINGING THE LUNGS TO THE SAME STATE AFTER FORCIBLE EXPIRATION 0OO PARTS OF THE MIXTURE OF EXPIRED GAS GAVE 8 CARBONIC ACID I OXYGEN 79 AZOTE LOOATMOSPHERIC AIR AND OXYGEN GAS BY RESPRIRA TI CALCULATION FOR CARBONIC ACID 100 8 9872  78976 SO THAT 78976 CUBIC INCHES OF CARBONIC ACID GAS WERE GIVEN OFF IN 24 MINUTES WHICH GIVES THIRTYTWO CUBIC INCHES PER MINUTE BUT HERE IT MUST BE NOTICED THAT THE RESPIRATION WAS MORE RAPID THAN IN THE LITH EXPERIMENT AND A LARGER QUANTITY OF CARBONIC ACID GIVEN OFF IN THE SAME TIME THIS AGREES WITH THE 1 2TH EXPERIMENT WE ARE VERY MUCH INCLINED TO THINK THAT IN ORDINARY RESPI RATION A GREAT PART OF THE AIR IS RETURNED UNALTERED VIZ THAT CONTAINED IN THE FAUCES IN THE TRACHEA AND PROBABLY A PORTION OF THAT IN THE LARGER BRANCHES OF THE BRONCHIA IF THIS CIRCUM STANCE BE NOT ADVERTED TO IN EXPERIMENTS UPON SMALL QUANTI TIES OF AIR THE RESULTS CAN NEVER BE CORRECT THERE IS EVEN A CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCE IN THE QUALITY OF THE FIRST AND LAST POR TIONS OF A SINGLE INSPIRATION IN SOME EXPERIMENTS MADE WITH A VIEW TO THIS SUBJECT A SMALL QUANTITY OF THE FIRST PORTIONS GIVEN OFF IN A COMMON AND NATURAL EXPIRATION WAS RECEIVED IN A VESSEL OVER MERCURY ON EXAMINATION IT ONLY CONTAINED 35 PER CENT CARBONIC ACID IN OTHER EXPERIMENTS THE FIRST POR TIONS CONTAIN FROM THREE TO FIVE PER CENT WHILE THE GENERAL AVERAGE APPEARS BY THE ITH 12TH AND I3TH EXPERIMNENTS TO BE ABOUT EIGHT THE OPERATOR AFTER RATHER MORE THAN A NATURAL INSPIRATION EXPIRED O04CUBIC INCHES INTO THE MERCURIAL GASOMETER MAKING HIS UTMOST EFFBRTS TO PRESS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE OUT OF THE LUNGS THIS CONTAINED 95 PER CENT OF ARBONIC ACID HERE WE ARE TO RECOLLECT THAT THESE 204 CUBIC INCHES CONTAINED THE FIRST AS WELL AS THE LAST PORTIONS THE FIRST PORTIONS HAVE BEEN LI 12 5926C MSR ALLT AND  TM T CHAW MESPDUCED IN 3IT NTOW APPEARED TO US OF CONSEQUENCE TO ASCERTAIN EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO A GIVEN VOLUME OF

OF G 1 HAD BEEN MADE TO0 PASS THROUGH THE LUNIGS AND TRANSMITTED TO G 2 THE AIR WAS THEN INSPIRED FROM G 2 AND EXPIRED INTO G L UNTIL G 2 WAS NEARLY EMPTY THIS WAS REPEATED ABOUT EIGHT OR TEN TIMES DURING THREE MINUTES UNTIL RESPIRATION BECAME EX TREMELY LABORIOUS AND THE OPERATOR DESISTED THE WHOLE 3OO CUBIC INCHES MUST HAVE PASSED EIGHT OR TEN TIMES THROUGH THE LUNGS AND WE CONFIDENTLY EXPECTED THAT ON EXAMINING THE AIR WE SHOUL A D HAAN UNUSUAL PRO PORTION OF CARBONIC ACID BUT 1OO PARTS GAVE ONLY 95 CARBONIC ACID 55 OXYGEN 85 AZOTE 100  IN THIS EXPERIMENT THERE WAS OBVIOUSLY NO OCCASION TO MAKE ALLOWANCE FOR THE AIR CONTAINED IN THE TUBES AND SOCKETS WE FIND ITS VOLUME TO BE EIGHTEEN CUBIC INCHESTMOSPHERIC AIR AND OXYGENI G8AS BY RESIRAIN 261 HERE WAS AN INCREASE OF SIX PARTS INL OO OF SOMETHING WHICL THE TESTS FOR OXYGEN OULD NOT TAKE UP AND ALSO A LOSS OF SIX PER CENT OXYGEN THIS SEEMED TO CONVINCE US THAT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AS DURING SOME PECULIAR ALTERATIONIN THE VITAL FUNCTIONS GASEOUS OXIDE OF CARBON CARBURETTED HYDROGEN OR SOME OTHER GAS NOT ABSORBABLE BY LIME WATER OR THE TESTS FOR OXYGEN MIGHT BE GIVEN OFF FROM THE LUNGS AND WE ACCORD INGLY DETERMINED TO REPEAT CRUIKSHANKS EXPERIMENTS WITH HYPEROXYGENISED MURIATIC ACID GAS WE PROCURED THE GAS FROM LIYPEROXYGENISED MURIATE OF POTASH BY MEANS OF MURIATIC ACID AND MIXING IT WITH A KNOWN PORTION OF GASEOUS OXIDE OF CARBON IN A FLINT STOPPER BOTTLE THE MOUTH OF WHICH WAS IMMERSED IN MERCURY FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS THE GASEOUS OXIDE OF CARBON WAS CONVERTED INTO CARBONIC ACID GAS AS WAS PROVED BY ITS EFFECTS UPON LIME WATER WHICH WHEN BOTH THE GASSES ARE PURE ABSORBS THEM ENTIRELY AFTER THEY HAVE REMAINED TOGETHER FOR TWENTYFOUR HOURS IT WAS PLAIN THEREFORE THAT WE HAD THE MEANS OF DETECTING GASEOUS OXIDE OF CARBON AND DOUBTLESS CARBURRETTED HYDROGEN IF ANY SHOULD BE CONTAINED IN THE EXPIRED GAS FROM A CONVICTION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE EXPERIMENTS WE WERE DETERMINED TO TAKE NOTHING UPON TRUST F5FTEENTH EXPERIMENT WE REPEATED THE 14TH EXPERIMENT WITH A LITTLE VARIATION IN THIS CASE WE EMPLOYED ONLY ONE OF THE MERCURIAL GASO METERS INTO WHICH EXACTLY 300 CUBIC INCHES OF ATMOSPHERIC AIR WERE ADMITTED THE OPERATOR HAVING MADE AN EASY EX PIRATION APPLIED HIS MOUTH TO THE COCK AT THE TOP OF THE BELL GLASS AND THE TIME BEING NOTED BEGAN TO BREATHE IN LESSMEIM L RS ALL NIE IPYS OFL T AG7 PREED I THAN A MINUTE HE FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED TO TAKE DEEPER AND DEEPER INSPIRATIONS AND AT LAST THE EFFORTS OF THE LUNGS TO TAKEIN AIR BECAME SO STRONG AND SUDDEN THAT THE GLASS WAS IN SOME DANGER OF BEING BROKEN AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE GASO METER A GREAT SENSE OF OPPRESSION AND SUFFOCATION WAS NOW FELT IN THE CHEST VISION BECAME INDISTINCT AND AFTER THE SECOND MINUTE HIS WHOLE ATTENTION SEEMED TO BE WITHDRAWN FROLRI SURROUNDING OBJECTS AND FIXED UPON THE EXPERIMENT HE NOW EXPERIENCED THAT BUZZ IN THE EARS WLICH IS NOTICED IN BREATHING NITROUS OXIDE AND AFTER THE THIRD MINUTE HAD ONLY SUFFICIENT RECOLLECTION TO CLOSE THE COCK AFTER AN EXPIRATION THIS SECURED THE RESULT OF THE EXPERIMENT BUT HE BECAME SO PERFECTLY IN SENSIBLE THAT ON RECOVERING HE WAS MUCH SURPRISED AT FIND ING HIS FRIEND AND THE ASSISTANT ON THE TABLE IN THE ACT OF SUP PORTING HIM IT WAS NOTICED THAT HE MADE THIRTYFIVE INSPI RATIONS DURING THE EXPERIMENT WE NOW EXAMINED THE AIR WHICH HAD BEEN SO TREATED LO PARTS CONTAINED O1 CARBONIC ACID 4 OXYGEN 86 AZOTE 100 IN THIS EXPERIMENT IT IS REMARKABLE THAT THE AIR WHICH HAD BEEN SO OFTEN THROUGH THE LUNGS SHOULD ONLY HAVE FURNISHED LO PER CENT OF CARBONIC ACID WHILE THE AIR WHICH PASSES THEM BUT ONCE CONTAINS FROM 8 TO 85 HERE THE OXYGEN HAD LOST 7 FROM 21 AND THE AZOTE HAD GAINED 7 UPON 79 WE KNEW BY PREVIOUS EXPERIMENT THAT EVERY CUBIC INCH OF  SEE THE EXPERIMENTS ON CARBONIC ACID IN THE SOCIETYS TRANSACTIONSATMOSPHERIC AIR AND OXYGEN GAS BY RESPIRATION CARBONIC ACID GAS REQUIRED EXACTLY A CUBIC INCH OF OXYGEN FOR ITS FORMATION THE TEN PARTS OF CARBONIC ACID MAY THEREFORE BE RECKONED AS OXYGEN WHICH WOULD MAKE THE CONSTITUTION OF F 14 OXYGEN THE GAS AFTER THE EXPERIMENT 86 AZOTE WHEREAS BEFORE THE EXPERIMENT IT WASF X OXYGEN X79 AZOTE NOW WE DID NOT SUPPOSE THE RESIDUUM OF 86 TO BE ALL AZOTE THOUGH 79 MIGHT BE THEREFORE SEVEN PARTS APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN ADDED BY THIS UNNATURAL MODE OF RESPIRING AND WE CON JECTURED THE ADDITION MIGHT BE GASEOUS OXIDE OF CARBON TO ASCERTAIN THIS WE PUT 40 PARTS INTO A FLINT STOPPER BOTTLE AND NEARLY FILLED IT WITH ABOUT LOO PARTS HYPEROXYGENISED MURIATIC ACID PROCURED AS BEFORE AND RECENTLY PREPARED THE STOPPER BEING PUT IN OVER DISTILLED WATER WE PLUNGED IT IN QUICKSILVER AND FILLED A SECOND BOTTLE IN THE SAME WAY AS A COMPARATIVE EXPERIMENT WE NEXT PROCURED SOME PURE AZOTE BY ABSORBING THE OXYGEN FROM A PORTION OF ATMOSPHERIC AIR BY THE SATURATED GREEN SULPHATE AND SIMPLE GREEN SULPHATE AS USUAL 40 PARTS OF THIS AZOTE WERE MIXED WITH THE SAME PROPORTION OF THE ACID GAS AS IN THE OTHER EXPERIMENT AND THE WHOLE SUFFERED TO STAND FOR FORTYEIGHT HOURS  AT THE END OF THIS TIME THE AZOTE WAS EX AMINED BY WASHING IT FIRST IN DISTILLED WATER AND AFTERWARDS IN THE EUDIOMETER WITH THE TESTS FOR OXYGEN AND THERE WERE STILL EXACTLY 4O PARTS LEFT PROVING THAT THE HYPEROXYGENISED MURIATIC ACID GAS HAS NO ACTION UPON AZOTE WE THEN EXAMINED THE BOTTLES CONTAINING THE RESIDUUM FROM THE AIR THAT HAD BEEN SO OFTEN RESPIRED AND FOUND THAT IT HAD NOT EXPERIENCED THE SLIGHTEST CHANGE IT WAS THEREFORE PLAINLY 263IT6 MESSRS ALLEN AND PEPYS ON THE CHANGES PRODUCED IN AZOTE AND ON REFLECTION IT OCCURRED TO US THAT IF A CERTAIN PROPORTION OF OXYGEN HAD BEEN ABSORBED OR LOST IN ANY WAY WHILE THE AZOTE REMAINED UNALTERED THERE MUST BE AN INCREASED PROPORTION OF THE LATTER NOW WE KNEW EXACTLY BOTH THE BULK AND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE AIR BEFORE THE EXPERIMENT BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW THE BULK OR VOLUME AFTER THE EXPERIMENT OTHERWISE THAN BY CALCULATION THE 300 CUBIC INCHES OF ATMOSPHERIC AIR BEFORE THE EXPERI MENT CONTAINED 21 OXYGEN 79 AZOTE IN OO PARTS MAKING THE TOTAL QUANTITY OF OXYGEN 63 CUBIC INCHES AZOTE 237 30O NOW IF THE LUNGS BE CAPABLE OF FIXING PERMANENTLY ANY AZOTE FROM THE ATMOSPHERE IT APPEARS BY OUR EXPERIMENTS THAT THE QUANTITY MUST BE VERY MINUTE SEEING THAT IN THE ITTH 12TH AND 13TH EXPERIMENT IT DID NOT DISTURB THE RO PORTION OF AZOTE AS SHEWN BY THE EUDIOMETER WE SHALL THERE FORE IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE ASSUME THE VOLUME OF AZOTE AFTER THE EXPERIMENT AT 237 CUBIC INCHES AS BEFORE BUT AFTER THE EXPERIMENT EVERY LOO PARTS CONSISTECD CI 86 PARTS AZOTE AND 14 OXYGEN EITHER IN THE FORM OF CARBONIC ACID OR FREE 86   237  3858 THEREFORE THE TOTAL QUANTITY OF OXYGEN LEFT AFTER THE EXPERI MENT WOULD HAVE BEEN 3858 CUBIC

THEFOREL 9 THAT 4  UBIINCHES OF XYGENAHD BEEN ABSORBED BY THE SYSTEM UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THI EXPERIMENT REVIEWING THE 14TH EXPERIMENT IT APPEARS THAT THE GAS AFTER RXESPIRATION CONTAINED 85 PER

NEAR THE AVERAGE OF THE FIRST TEN EXPERIMENTS AND BECAUSE IT VERY NEARLY AGREES WITH THE STATEMENT OF PROFESSOR DAVY IN THIS EXPERIMENT 29 CUBIC INCHES OF CARBONIC ACID GAS WERE GIVEN OFF IN ELEVEN

IN CONTACT WITH THOSE PARTS OF THE LUNGS CALCULATED TO ACT UPON IT THE PROPORTION OF CARBONIC ACID GAS GIVEN OFF IN NATURAL RESPIRATION OUGHT PROBABLY TO STAND CONSIDERABLY LOWER THAN IN THE ABOVE

GREAT PART OF THIS MAY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY ADVERTING TO THE STATE OF THE LUNGS AFTER THE EXPERIMENT THE ADDITION OF 11OO8 CUBIC INCHES OF AZOTE WE CONSIDER ASA ARISING FROM THAT PORTION STILL RETAINED IN THE LUNGS NOTWITH STANDING THE FORCED EXPIRATION AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EX PERIMENT AND CONSIDERING THAT IN THE 14TH AND I5TH EXPERI MENT WHERE THE SAME AIR WAS REPEATEDLY BREATHED THE PRO PORTION OF AZOTE WAS IN THE ONE CASE 85 AND IN THE OTHER 86 PER CENT IT SEEMS FAIR TO PRESUME THAT THE RESIDUAL AIR CONTAINED IN THE LUNGS AFTER A FORCED EXPIRATION MAY AMOUNT IN IOO PARTS TO NOT MORE THAN 16

LUNGS WITH WHICH THE AIR COMES IN CONTACT IF SPREAD OUT WOULD PRESENT A SURFACE EQUAL TO THAT OF THE SUPERFICIES OF THE WHOLE BODY AND LASTLY THAT THIS VISCUS IS SO EXCEEDINGLY SPONGY AND POROUS THAT WHEN ONCE INFLATED IT IS EVER AFTER IMPOSSIBLE BY ORDINARY MECHANICAL MEANS TO EXPEL THE AIR COMPLETELY HE WILL EASILY PERCEIVE NOT ONLY THAT A LARGE POR TION OF AIR MUST REMAIN FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME IN CONTACT WITH THE INTERNAL SURFACE OF THE LUNGS WHERE IT IS LIABLE TO LOSE A PORTION OF ITS OXYGEN BUT ALSO THAT THE RESIDUAL QUANTITY OF AIR IN THE LUNGS AFTER THE MOST VIOLENT ATTEMPTS AT EXPIRATION MAY BE VERY CONSIDERABLE IT IS TO THIS CIRCUMSTANCE THAT WE ATTRIBUTE THE EXCESS OF AZOTE IN THE EXPERIMENTS UPON OXYGEN AND PRETTY DEEP INSPIRATIONS OF THIS GAS HAVING BEEN MADE DURING

CONTAINED IN TO 1 O BUT THE CONTENTS OF THE FIRST AND LAST GASOMETERS CONFIRM THE FORMER EXPERIMENT AND SHEWS THAT THE PROPORTION OF AZOTE CONTINUES TO DIMINISH AS THE EXPERI MENT PROCEEDS AND ALSO THAT THERE IS A LARGER PROPORTION OF CARBONIC ACID GIVEN OFF WHEN OXYGEN IS EMPLOYED INSTEAD OF ATMOSPHERIC AIR IN THIS RECITAL OF EXPERIMENTS WHICH HAVE OCCUPIED A CON SIDERABLE PORTION OF TIME AND ATTENTION WE HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO GIVE A PLAIN STATEMENT OF FACTS FROM WHICH EVERY ONE MAY DRAW CONCLUSIONS FOR HIMSELF WE SHALL HERE HOWEVER TAKE THE LIBERTY OF BRIEFLY RECAPITULATING THE PRINCIPAL OF THOSE FACTS AND SUBMITTING WHAT SEEMS TO US THE MOST OBVIOUS INFERENCES 1 IT APPEARS THAT THE QUANTITY OF CARBONIC ACID GAS EMITTED IS EXACTLY EQUAL BULK FOR BULK TO THE OXYGEN CONSUMED AND THEREFORE THERE IS NO REASON TO CONJECTURE THAT ANY WATER IS FORMED BY A UNION OF OXYGEN AND HYDROGEN IN THE LTNGS 2 ATMOSPHERIC AIR ONCE ENTERING THE LUNGS RETURNS CHARGED WITH FROM 8 TO 85 PER CENT CARBONIC ACID GAS AND WHEN THE CONTACTS ARE REPEATED ALMOST AS FREQUENTLY AS POSSIBLE ONLY O1 PER CENT IS EMITTED THE 12TH AND 3TH EXPERIMIENTS PROVE THAT WHEN THE IN SPIRATIONS AND EXPIRATIONS ARE MORE RAPID THAN USUAL A LARGER QUANTITY OF CARBONIC ACID IS EMITTED IN A GIVEN TIME BUT THE PROPORTION IS NEARLY THE SAME OR ABOUT 8 PER CENT THE PRO PORTIONS OF CARBONIC ACID GAS IN THE FIRST AND LAST PORTIONS OF A DEEP INSPIRATION DIFFER AS WIDELY AS FROM 35 TO 95 PER CENT 3 CONSIDERING THE LITH AS A STANDARD EXPERIMENT IT APPEARS THAT A MIDDLE SIZED MAN AGED ABOUT THIRTYEIGHT YEARS AND WHOSE PULSE IS SEVENTY ON AN AVERAGE GIVES OIF 3O0 CUBICESO IMESSRS ALLEN AND  EPYS OT0 THE CHANGES PRODUCED IZ INCHES OF CARBONIC ACID GAS FROM HIS LUNGS IN ELEVEN MINUTES AND SUPPOSING THE PRODUCTION UNIFORM FOR TWENTYFOUR HOURS THE TOTAL QUANTITY IN THAT PERIOD WOULD BE 39534 CUBIC INCHES WEIGHING 18683 GRAINS THE CARBON IN WHICH IS 5363 GRAINS OR RATHER MORE THAN 1 OZ TROY THE OXYGEN CONSUMED IN THE SAME TIME WILL BE EQUAL IN VOLUME TO THE CARBONIC ACID GAS BUT IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE QUANTITY OF CARBONIC ACID GAS EMITTED IN A GIVEN TIME MUST DEPEND VERY MUCH UPON THE CIRCUM STANCES UNDER WHICH RESPIRATION IS PERFORMED AND HERE IT MAY BE PROPER TO NOTICE THAT ALL THE EXPERIMENTS WERE MADE BE TWEEN BREAKFAST AND DINNER 4 WHEN RESPIRATION IS ATTENDED WITH DISTRESSING CIRCUM STANCES AS IN THE 14TH AND 15TH EXPERIMENTS THERE IS REASON TO CONCLUDE THAT A PORTION OF OXYGEN IS ABSORBED AND IN THE LAST OF THESE EXPERIMENTS WE MAY REMARK THAT AS THE OXYGEN DECREASES IN QUANTITY PERCEPTION GRADUALLY CEASES AND WE MAY SUPPOSE THAT LIFE WOULD BE COMPLETELY EXTINGUISHED ON THE TOTAL ABSTRACTION OF OXYGEN 5 A LARGER PROPORTION OF CARBONIC ACID GAS IS FORMED BY THE HUMAN SUBJECT FROM OXYGEN THAN FROM ATMOSPHERIC AIR 6 AN EASY NATURAL INSPIRATION IS FROM 16 TO 17 CUBIC INCHES IN THE SUBJECT OF THESE EXPERIMENTS WHO MAKES ABOUT 19 IN A MINUTE THIS HOWEVER WILL VARY IN DIFFERENT INDIVI DUALS AND PERHAPS WE OUGHT TO ESTIMATE THE QUANTITY OF CAR BONIC ACID GAS GIVEN OFF IN PERFECTLY NATURAL RESPIRATION AT SOMEWHAT LESS AND MOST LIKELY AT CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN IN THE STATEMENT ABOVE WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT IN SHORT INSPIRATIONS THE QUANTITY OF AIR WHICH HAS REACHED NO FARTHER THAN THE FAUCES TRACHEA C BEARS A MUCH LARGER PROPORTION TO THE WHOLE MASS RESPIRED THAN WHEN THE INSPIRATIONS ARE DEEPATMOSPHERIC AIIR AND OXYGEN GAS BY RESPIRATION 7 NO HYDROGEN NOR ANY OTHER GAS APPEARS TO BE EVOLVED DURING THE PROCESS OF RESPIRATION 8 THE GENERAL AVERAGE OF THE DEFICIENCY IN THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF COMMON AIR INSPIRED APPEARS TO BE VERY SMALL AMOUNTING ONLY TO ABOUT 6 PARTS IN 1 OO AND WE ARE INCLINED TO ATTRIBUTE IT IN GREAT MEASURE TO THE DIFFICULTY IN EXHAUSTING THE LUNGS AS COMPLETELY AFTER AN EXPERIMENT AS BEFORE IT THE FIRST EXPIRA TION BEING MADE INTO THE OPEN AIR THE LAST INTO THE APPARATUS 9 THE EXPERIMENTS UPON OXYGEN GAS PROVE THAT THE QUAN TITY OF AIR REMAINING IN THE LUNGS AND ITS APPENDAGES IS VERY CONSIDERABLE AND THAT WITHOUT A REFERENCE TO THIS CIRCUM STANCE ALL EXPERIMENTS UPON SMALL QUANTITIES OF GAS ARE LIABLE TO INACCURACY OTHER IMPORTANT CONCLUSIONS MIGHT PERHAPS BE DRAWN FROM THE FACTS RELATED IN THIS PAPER BUT HAVING ALREADY TRESPASSED LARGELY UPON THE TIME OF THE SOCIETY WE SHALL ABSTAIN FROM ANY FARTHER REMARKS UNTIL WE BRING FORWARD A NEW SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS NMDCCCVIII 281 O O

OF THE SCREEN TO BEGIN VIEWING THE ARTICLEAN ACCOMPT OF SOME BOOKS I A DISCOURSE TOUCHING THE ORIGINAL OF HUMAN LITERATURE BOTH PHILOLOGY AND PHILOSO PHY IN TWO PARTS BY THEOPH GALE M A OXFORD 1669 AND 1671 IN 4 THE BUSINESS OF THIS BOOK IS TO DERIVE HUMAN ARTS AND SCIENCES FROM THE JEWISH CHURCH FOR THE DOING OF WHICH THE AUTHOR PROFESSETH HE HATH BEEN ENCOURAGED BY CONSIDERABLE HINTS AND ASSISTANCES OF THE SCALIGERS AND OF GROTIUS VOSSIUS BOCHARTUS SELDEN USHER PRESTON AND OTHERS BESIDES THE CONCURRENT RESTIMONIES OF MANY OF THE ANCIENTS IN THE FIRST PART HE ENDEAVOURS TO PROVE THAT ALL LAN GUAGES HAVE THEIR ORIGIN AND RISE FROM THE HEBREW INSTAN CING PARTICULARLY IN THE ORIENTAL TONGUES AS THE PHENI CIAN COPTHIC CHALDAIC SYRIAC ARABIC PERSIAN SAMARITAN M M M AND2232 AND ETHIOPIC AND THEN IN THE EUROPEAN ESPECIALLY THE GREEK LATIN THE OLD GALLIC AND BRITTANNIC TO WHICH HE ADDS A DEDUCTION IMPORTING THAT THE PAGAN THEOLOGY PHYSICK POLITICKS POESIE HISTORY RHETORIC ARE TRADU CED FROM SACRED NAMES PERSONS RITES AND RECORDS AND SHEWING WITHAL HOW THE JEWISH TRADITIONS CAME TO BE CORRUPTED AND MISTAKEN BY PAGANS IN THE SECOND PART HE MAKETH IT HIS BUSINESS TO EVINCE THAT PHILOSOPHY ALSO HATH ITS ORIGINAL FROM THE JEWISH CHURCH BEGINNING TO SHEW THIS OF THE BARBARIC PHILOSOPHY UNDER WHICH HE COMPREHENDS THE EGYPTIAN PHENICIAN CHALDEAN PERSIANINDIAN ETHIOPIC SCYTHIAN AND BRITANNIC AND THENCE PROCEEDING TO THE GRECIAN AND CHIEFLY TO THE IONIC AND ITALIC OR PYTHAGOREAN WHERE HE SHEWS GREAT READING AND LEARNING WHILST HE DEDUCETH THIS DOCTRINE OF JUDAIC ORI GIN FROM THE TESTIMONIES OF HEATHEN JEWISH AND CHRI STIAN BOTH ANCIENT AND MODERNAUTHORS PASSING THROUGH ALL THE PARTICULAR SECTS OF PHILOSOPHERS WITH GREAT SOLICI TUDE AND INDUSTRYAND PROMISING AT THE END OF THIS WORK THAT HE IS WILLING TO UNDERTAKE ANOTHER TREATISE TO SHEW BOTH THE MISCHIEF OF VAIN AND THE USEFULNESS OF SOUND PHILOSOPHY TO CHRISTIAN RELIGION IF THIS HISTORICAL AC COMPT DELIVERD IN THESE

PRINTED AT FRANK FORD ABOUT TWO YEARS SINCE THOUGH YET BUT IN PART THERE BEING HITHERTO EXTANT ONLY THE FIRST BOOK OF THE TWO OF WHICH IT IS TO CONSIST WHICH FIRST PART TO GIVE SOME ACCOMPT OF IT ON THIS OCCASION UNDERTAKETH TO EX PLAIN BOTH THE ABSTRUSE GENERATION OF SUBTERRANEOUS THINGS AND THE ADMIRABLE FABRIC OF THE SUPERTERRANEOUS AND SUBTERRANEOUS COMPLEX GLOBE OF EARTH AIR AND WATER2233 WATER PROMISING TO DELIVER HEREAFTER IN THE SECOND BOOK THE PARTICULAR NATURE OF UNDERGROUND BODIES AND WITHAL TO TEACH THE RESOLUTION OF THEM INTO PARTS AND THE PROPRIETIES OF THOSE PARTS TOGETHER WITH AN APPENDIX THAT SHALL CONTAIN A GREAT NUMBER OF CHYMICAL MIXTURES NEVER SEEN BEFORE AND GROUNDED UPON NUMEROUS EXPERI MENTS WE CANNOT FORBEAR GIVING THE READER OF THAT GREAT VARIETY OF MATTER AND TRIALS CONTAIND IN THE SAID FIRST BOOK ONE VERY CONSIDERABLE EXPERIMENT SAID TO HAVE BEEN ACTUALLY MADE BY THE AUTHOUR HIMSELFAND WHICH SEEMS WORTH REPEATING FOR FURTHER OBSERVATION AND IM PROVEMENT IT IS IN SHORT THIS AS IT MAY BE FOUND P 170 171 PHYSICAE SUBTERRANEAE HAVING A MIND FOR A CERTAIN END TO MELT A JASPER HE SAITH HE PUT IT INTO A CRUCIBLE AND ACTUALLY MELTED IT BY AN INTENSE FIRE AND SOME OTHER REQUISITES NECESSARY TO THE OPERATION BUT TO THE END THAT NO COALS MIGHT FALL INTO THE PAST HE COVERD AND LUTED THE CRUCIBLE WHICH WAS A BOUT HALF FILLD WITH JASPERSTONE WHICH BEING NOW MEL TED HE OPEND THE CRUCIBLE WHEN COOL AND TO HIS GREAT WONDER FOUND AT THE BOTTOM THE JASPER MELTED TOGETHER INTO ONE MASS AS HARD AS BEFORE BUT MILKWHITE AND HALF OPAQUE RESEMBLING A NATURAL WHITE AGAT BUT THE COVER AND THE UPPER PARTS OF THE CRUCIBLE THAT WERE UNFILLD AND COULD NOT BE TOUCHED BY THE JASPER IN THE MELTING WERE TINGED WITH THE NATURAL COLOUR OF THE JASPER INSO MUCH THAT IF THERE HAD BEEN THE HARDNESS OF A JASPER AND THE COLOUR NOT SUPERFICIAL ONLY THE FRAGMENTS OF THE CRU CIBLE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOLD FOR THE BEST AND MOST POLISHD JASPER HAVING HERE AND THERE GREENISH STREAKS AND SPECKS THE REST BEING RED AND YELLOWISH ALL SO BEAUTIFUL THAT A GOOD PAINTER WOULD SCARCE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IMITATE THOSE VARIOUS COLOURS OF THISTHE AUTHOR SAITHHE KEEPETH STILL THE PEICES IN HIS LABORATORY AT MUNCHEN IN BAVARIA AS A VERY EXTRAORDINARY TREASURE ESTEEMING THAT THOSE UPPER PARTS WERE TINGED BY THE ANIMA OF THE JASPER DRIVEN UP BY THE FORCE OF THE FIRE FROM ITS INFERIOUR PARTAND ADHERING TO THE BODY OF THE CRUCIBLE HAVING THUS RELATED THIS UNCOMMON EXPERIMENT WE M M M 2 SHALL2234 SHALL PROCEED TO SAY SOMETHING OF THE CONTENTS OF THIS SUPP EMENT WHICH OCCASIOND THAT RELATION IT SEEMS THEN THAT THE LEARND DR ROLFINK PROFESSOR OF PHYSICK IN THE UNIVERSITY OF JENA IN UPPER SAXONY IN HIS BOOK ENTI TLED CHYMIA IN ARTIS FORMAM REDACTA AFFIRMS THAT THE CUR RENT MERCURY OF BODIES IS A NONENS WHICH OUR AUTHOR LOOKING UPON AS AN UNGROUNDED AND PRECARIOUS ASSERTION LABOURS IN THIS TRACT TO CONSUTE IT FROM AUTHORITY REASON AND EXPERIMENTAS MAY BE SEEN PAG 81 C THAT WHICH WE SHALL TAKE HERE PARTICULAR NOTICE OF IS THAT CHYMICAL EXPERIMENT WHICH GIVETH THE TITLE TO THE BOOK AND IS CALLED NEW ALLEDGED TO PROVE THE REAL AND SUDDEN GENE RATION AND TRANSMUTATION OF METTALS YOU MAY TAKE IT THUS IF YOU PLEASE HE TOOK COMMON BRICKEARTH DRYD IT IN THE AIR THAT IT MIGHT BE SIFTED THEN POURED SO MUCH LINSEEDOYL UP ON IT AS THAT HE MIGHT ROLE IT INTO LITTLE BALLS OF THE SIZE OF THE RETORTS NECK WHICH THEY WERE TO BE PUT INTO TO THE END THAT THE DISTILLATION BEING MADE HE NEEDED NOT TO BREAK HIS RETORT FOR THE TAKING OUT OF THE CAPUT MORTUUM BUT MIGHT RESERVE IT FOR OTHER USE THAT THE FIRE MIGHT THE MORE FORCIBLE PENETRATE THOSE GLOBULS THAN IF THE MATTER WERE IN ONE MASS HE FILLED THE RETORT WITH THEM AND BY DEGREES DISTILLD THEM WITH AN OPEN FIRE DURING AN HOUR OR TWO THIS DISTILLATION BEING FINISHD HE FOUND IN THE RECIPIENT AN OYL ALMOST LIKE THAT WHICH HE SAITH IS IM PROPERLY CALLD OLEUM PHILOSOPHORUM THEN THE RETORT BE ING COOLD HE TOOK THE LITTLE BALLS OUT OF IT WHICH NOT BEING FOUND RED BY SO STRONG A FIRE BUT VERY BLACK HE SUSPECTED THAT BLACKNESS PROCEEDED FROM THE OYL SOME TERRESTRIAL PARTS OF WHICH BEING FIXD AND SEVERD BY VERTUE OF THE BRICKEARTH MIGHT THERE HAVE ASSUMED A BODY WHICH OF WHAT KIND IT WAS WAS NOW FURTHER TO BE EXAMIND BY TRIAL HAVING THEREFORE BEATEN SMALL THESE BLACK GLOBULS AND SIF TED THEMHE PUT THEM INTO A DISH AND HAVING POWRD SOME COMMON WATER UPON IT HE STIRRD IT THEN BEING GROWN TURBID HE GENTLY POWRED IT OFF AND POWRED ON FRESH CLEAR WATER STILL STIRRING THE MATTER WHICH HE SO OFTEN RE PEATED AND CONTINUED TILL THE WATER CAME CLEAR AWAY AND THERE2235 THERE REMAIND AT THE BOTTOME OF THE DISH A PONDEROUS BLACK SEDIMENT WHICH FROM ITS WEIGHT AND SUDDEN SUBSI DENCE AS ALSO FROM ITS DARK COLOUR HE SUSPECTED TO BE OF A METALLICK AND INDEED OF AN IRON NATURE WHICH BEING DRYD UPON PAPER UPON THE APPLICATION OF A LOADSTONE WAS THEREBY ATTRACTED IN SEVERAL GRAINS WHICH BY ALL PROOFS HE FOUND TO BE VERY GOOD IRON ESTEEMING HENCE THAT SULPHUREOUS SPIRITS MAY BE FIXED BY A CERTAIN EARTH AS THEIR MATRIX HE SAITH THAT HE EM PLOYD THE SAME METHOD WITH ALL MINERALS SULPHURS AND MERCURY IT SELF AND ACCORDINGLY MELTED VARIOUS MINERALS WITH VARIOUS EARTHS AND CLAYS WHEREBY HE DISCOVERED MANY TRUTHS  TRANSMUTATIONSAND TO CONVINCE HIS REA DERS OF THE REALITY OF THIS EXPERIMENT HE SPENDS A WHOLE CHAPTER TO PROVE THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER OF FACT AND OF THE GENUINESS OF THE IRON PRODUCED EXAMINING WITHAL WHETHER THAT IRON THUS PRODUCED HAD NOT BEEN LATENT EI THER IN THE EARTH OR IN THE OYL AND SO MIGHT HAVE IM POSD UPON HIM AND HAVING FOUND IT HAD NOT HE INQUI RETH WHAT MAY BE THE METALLICK CAUSE IN GENERAL IN THIS EX PERIMENT AND IN PARTICULAR WHAT THE FERRIFICK IF WE MAY BE ALLOWD TO

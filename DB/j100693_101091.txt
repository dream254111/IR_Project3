and 1671 in 4 The Business of this Book is to derive Human Arts and Sciences from the Jewish Church for the doing of which the Author professeth he hath been encouraged by considerable hints and assistances of the Scaligers and of Grotius Vossius Bochartus Selden Usher Preston and others besides the concurrent restimonies of many of the Ancients In the First part he endeavours to prove that all Lan guages have their origin and rise from the Hebrew instan cing particularly in the Oriental Tongues as the Pheni cian Copthic Chaldaic Syriac Arabic Persian Samaritan M m m and2232 and Ethiopic and then in the European especially the Greek Latin the old Gallic and Brittannic To which he adds a deduction importing that the Pagan Theology Physick Politicks Poesie History Rhetoric are tradu ced from Sacred Names Persons Rites and Records and shewing withal How the Jewish Traditions came to be corrupted and mistaken by Pagans In the Second part he maketh it his business to evince that Philosophy also hath its Original from the Jewish Church beginning to shew this of the Barbaric Philosophy under which he comprehends the Egyptian Phenician Chaldean PersianIndian Ethiopic Scythian and Britannic and thence proceeding to the Grecian and chiefly to the Ionic and Italic or Pythagorean where he shews great reading and learning whilst he deduceth this doctrine of Judaic Ori gin from the Testimonies of Heathen Jewish and Chri stian both Ancient and ModernAuthors passing through all the particular Sects of Philosophers with great solici tude and industryand promising at the end of this Work that he is willing to undertake another Treatise to shew both the Mischief of Vain and the Usefulness of Sound Philosophy to Christian Religion if this Historical Ac compt deliverd in these two Parts and mainly designed in Order thereunto find any such reception as may give encouragement to such Labours II Joh Joachimi Becheri Spirensis Med Doct EXPE RIMENTUM CHYMICUM NOVUM quo Artificialis  Instantanea Metallorum Generatio  Trans mutatio ad oculum demonstratur Francofurti A 1671 in 8 This Tract was written by the Authour as a Supple ment to his Physica Subterranea likewise printed at Frank ford about two years since though yet but in part there being hitherto extant only the first Book of the two of which it is to consist which First part to give some accompt of it on this occasion undertaketh to ex plain both the abstruse Generation of Subterraneous things and the admirable Fabric of the Superterraneous and Subterraneous complex Globe of Earth Air and Water2233 Water Promising to deliver hereafter in the Second Book the particular Nature of underground Bodies and withal to teach the Resolution of them into parts and the proprieties of those parts together with an Appendix that shall contain a great number of Chymical Mixtures never seen before and grounded upon numerous Experi ments We cannot forbear giving the Reader of that great variety of matter and Trials containd in the said First Book one very considerable Experiment said to have been actually made by the Authour himselfand which seems worth repeating for further observation and im provement It is in short this as it may be found p 170 171 Physicae Subterraneae Having a mind for a certain end to melt a Jasper he saith he put it into a crucible and actually melted it by an intense fire and some other requisites necessary to the operation But to the end that no coals might fall into the past he coverd and luted the crucible which was a bout half filld with Jasperstone which being now mel ted he opend the crucible when cool and to his great wonder found at the bottom the Jasper melted together into one Mass as hard as before but Milkwhite and half opaque resembling a natural White Agat but the cover and the upper parts of the crucible that were unfilld and could not be touched by the Jasper in the melting were tinged with the natural colour of the Jasper inso much that if there had been the hardness of a Jasper and the colour not superficial only the fragments of the cru cible might have been sold for the best and most polishd Jasper having here and there greenish streaks and specks the rest being red and yellowish all so beautiful that a good Painter would scarce have been able to imitate those various colours Of thisthe Author saithhe keepeth still the peices in his Laboratory at Munchen in Bavaria as a very extraordinary treasure esteeming that those upper parts were tinged by the anima of the Jasper driven up by the force of the fire from its inferiour partand adhering to the body of the crucible Having thus related this uncommon experiment we M m m 2 shall2234 shall proceed to say something of the Contents of this Supp ement which occasiond that relation It seems then that the learnd Dr Rolfink Professor of Physick in the University of Jena in Upper Saxony in his Book enti tled Chymia in Artis formam redacta affirms that the cur rent Mercury of Bodies is a NonEns which our Author looking upon as an ungrounded and precarious Assertion labours in this Tract to consute it from Authority Reason and Experimentas may be seen pag 81 c That which we shall take here particular notice of is that Chymical Experiment which giveth the Title to the Book and is called New alledged to prove the real and sudden Gene ration and Transmutation of Mettals You may take it thus if you please He took common Brickearth dryd it in the Air that it might be sifted then poured so much Linseedoyl up on it as that he might role it into little balls of the size of the Retorts neck which they were to be put into to the end that the distillation being made he needed not to break his retort for the taking out of the Caput mortuum but might reserve it for other use That the fire might the more forcible penetrate those globuls than if the matter were in one Mass he filled the Retort with them and by degrees distilld them with an open fire during an hour or two This distillation being finishd he found in the Recipient an Oyl almost like that which he saith is im properly calld Oleum Philosophorum then the Retort be ing coold he took the little balls out of it which not being found red by so strong a fire but very black he suspected that blackness proceeded from the Oyl some terrestrial parts of which being fixd and severd by vertue of the Brickearth might there have assumed a Body which of what kind it was was now further to be examind by trial Having therefore beaten small these black globuls and sif ted themhe put them into a dish and having powrd some common water upon it he stirrd it then being grown turbid he gently powred it off and powred on fresh clear water still stirring the matter which he so often re peated and continued till the water came clear away and there2235 there remaind at the bottome of the dish a ponderous black sediment which from its weight and sudden subsi dence as also from its dark colour he suspected to be of a Metallick and indeed of an Iron nature which being dryd upon paper upon the application of a Loadstone was thereby attracted in several grains which by all proofs he found to be very good Iron Esteeming hence that sulphureous Spirits may be fixed by a certain Earth as their Matrix he saith that he em ployd the same method with all Minerals Sulphurs and Mercury it self and accordingly melted various Minerals with various Earths and Clays whereby he discovered many Truths  TransmutationsAnd to convince his Rea ders of the reality of this Experiment he spends a whole Chapter to prove the truth of the matter of fact and of the genuiness of the Iron produced examining withal whether that Iron thus produced had not been latent ei ther in the Earth or in the Oyl and so might have im posd upon him and having found it had not he inqui reth what may be the Metallick cause in general in this Ex periment and in particular what the Ferrifick if we may be allowd to frame such a word or the Ironmaking Prin ciple c III De ABSYNTHIO Analecta per Joh Michael Fehr M D Lipsiae 1668 in 80 Several Learnd men in Germanyhaving associated them selves some years since into a Company under the Name of Academia Naturae Curioserum resolved to undertake each of themthe Description of some particular substance in Natureconsidering with themselves how long the world had been fruitlesly amused with Generals Of those par ticulars we only named some in Numb68p2078 but shall now endeavour to give an accompt in the remainder of this Tract of some performances of these undertakings Beginning here with the Treatise concerning  which but very lately came to our hands In it the Author describeth first its Nature enumerateth its differences ob serveth its vertues teacheth divers preparations anddeli vers its manifold Uses especially in strengthening and re covering2226 covering the stomack and all the parts of the lower Belly in curing the Colick Scurvy Jaundies Dropsie c in ope ning the Obstructions of the Liver and Spleen in expel ling Worms and driving away Moths and other like ver mine c After this he endeavors to solve divers Questions propo sed upon this subjectas 1 Whether the bitterness may be taken away from Wormwood without destroying its ver tues which is resolved in the Negative 2 Whether the Salts called Essential have the same vertue with their Sim ples Answ in the Affirmative 3 Whether the Resuscitati on of Plants be naturally possible Affirmd as to their re representation c Lastly he concludeth with an Enumera tion of Bitter things which are found among Roots Herbs Stalks Leaves Flowers Seeds Berries Fruits Barks Wood Gums Juyces Oyls Extracts Powders observing withal that generally all Bitter things have the power to commi nute to be astersive openingand purgativemore or less CROCOLOGIA Auth Joh Ferdinando Hertodt M D Jena 1671 in 80 This Author giveth us the Anatomy of Saffron and having described itand assigned its differences from its different nature time of production colour flower leaves and withal found the severalCountrys of its growthand shewd the way of its Culture and Propagation He proceeds to relate its Vertues and Uses in the doing of which he re commends it and the several preparations thereof of which he sets down not a few against the Headache Pal sy Vertiginous

Enumeration being made and a great number of Receipts of which Saffron is the chief Ingredient interspersed there are subjoyned several Quaeries viz 1 Whether Saffron be an Antidote to the poyson of Napellus It being affirmed so to be the Author adds a Relation of a consi derable Physitian concerning the Polanders frequent and harmless eating of Napellus in their Salats the reason whereof is ascribed to the common use of Saffron by that people 2 Whether Saffron removeth or causeth a surfet This is treated as disputable 3 Whether it induceth sleep or wakefulness And this questi on is here debated pro and con yet so as that the Author endea vours to reconcile the disputing parties 4 Whether Saffron tingeth the Faetus in the womb Here are alledged several Experiments for the affirmative of which the Author saith to have made one upon a Bitch with puppy which brought her young ones forth yellowycolourd after he had gi ven her for a good part of her bearing time all her meat and drink tinged with Saffron and for three dayes immediately be fore her whelping put some drachms of Saffron in her broth There are also inserted some Mechanical uses of this Vegeta ble for tinging of Hair yellow for making a liquor to write goldencolourd Letters with and gilding of Leatherc IV De LAUDANO OPIATO Auth Matth Tillingio M D Francofurti 1671 in 8 This Treatise hath four Parts The first contains the Origin of the Opiat Laudanum and the Praises of its Usefulness in general together with a disquisition of its Temperament and whether O pium be poysonous in its self and may be used uncorrected c The latter part of which question is here resolved in the Negative The Second treats of the genuine correction of Opium deli vers several descriptions of the Opiat Laudanum much esteemd both by Galenic and Chymical Physitians prescribeth the Dose and way of using it and withal anatomiseth and strictly examins his own preparation of this Medicin adding some cautions to be observed in the Use thereof The Third contains various Compositions of Opiat Medicines or such as have Opium or the Opiat Laudanum for their chief Ingredient together with an enumeration of their particular Vertues The Fourth specifieth those Maladies and distempers in which this Laudauum is singularly beneficial made out both by Reason and the observation of the Author aswell as of many other fa mous and worthy Physitians Here are reckond up Headaches Sleeplesness Phrensies Giddiness the Falling sickness Haemor ragies Pleurisies Bloudspitting Coughs Consumptions Pain tings2238 tings and Soundings Feavers Colicks Fluxes virulent Go norrhaeas Hysterical distempers c As to the ill success which at times hath attended the taking of Laudanum our Authour ascribeth that either to the unskilful pre paration or the unseasonable and indiscreet exhibition of it In the preparation he observeth that the malignity that is in Opi um is best corrected by Alcalys as having the force of ta ming that Narcotic sulphur containd in it agreeing herein with Helmonts Maxim Omne Narcoticum perit in Alcaly Advertisements Since the printing of the foregoing particulars there came to hand the New Observations above mentioned of the Spots of the Sun in Printmade at the Royal Academy in Paris the 11th 12th and 13th of August 1671 st n by Signor Cassini who intima teth at the end or his French Narrative concerning the samewhich is intended to be Englishd for the next Tract that from about Sept4th until Sept18 st n it will be worth while to observe whether the same Spots after they have passed over the upper He misphere of the Sunwhich is hidden to us will not return again and appear in its apparent Disque The same Spots have been observed as by a Letter from Dr Fogelius at Ham burg we were also very lately informd at Sea near the Tesselby M Picard one of the Royal Parifian Philosophers namely Aug3 nst and some of the fol lowing days as also at Hamburg the 7th 8th 9th of August nst Of which more also by the next opportunity What we have to add now which must not be deferd is the Prediction made by the same Signor cassiniof the Eclipses of the Satillits of Jupiter cal culated for Uianiburg and annexed here to the end that our Astronomers ha ving reduced them to our Latitude and Longitude may also observe the same The Immersions of the Satellits of 4 into its shadow visible

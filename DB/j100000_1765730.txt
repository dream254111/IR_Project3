in a purely scientific spirit iden tifying a plant during its flowering stage and finally col lecting its seeds when mature labelling them with both common and scientific names date of flowering and seed ing and laying away to form a part of what in time may grow to be a collection of real value One great objection that may be raised is undoubtedly the difficulty in correctly identifying seeds There are indeed comparatively few botanists who claim to be able to identify more than a small proportion of the plants they may know by the seed alone But this fact only em phasizes the desirability of undertaking just this line of work and but serves to illustrate the wellknown fact that work of real merit may not infrequently be done by the amateur who merely seeks recreation GEOIRGE P MERRILL Washington Sept 13 I893 SCIENCE IN THE SCHOOLS IN a recent article that wellknown scientist Dr Groff of Pennsylvania stated that it has long been the dream of scientists that the time would come when the elements of natural history and of the physical sciences would be taught in secondary and primary schools The college professor would indeed welcome a greater familiarity on the part of students entering their departments with the elements of the sciences but just where this training should begin is not so clear There is an organized effort being made in some of our leading educational cities to establish this work in not only the secondary schools but in grammar and primary grades as well While science should receive a large share of attention in the high schools and presumably in the grammar grades is it not going just a little too far to force such work into the primary grades It would certainly appear that with all the modern innovations already introduced into the primary rooms sufficient diversion is secured and cer tainly for pure busy work the ideal seems to have been reached Then why crowd these little minds with this additional load unless it is really superior as a means of Vol XXII No 556 education to those studies that are generally acknowledgde so essential as a foundation for subsequent work Again I submit that in this early formative period teaching and encouraging children to capture beautiful butterflies moths crickets or in fact any other insects with the purpose of killing them and picking them to pieces is not inspiring a regard for Gods creatures about them which sentiment should be instilled into these little people rather than crushed out of existence But I think that most agree that somewhere in the grammar grades the elements of natural history should be imparted Such however is the present crowded con dition of the curriculum of our grammar schools that but little very little time can be found for it Nor indeed would it be desirable to take much of the pupils time for such work in view of the fact that so many studies of more practical importance in life are taught and rightly too in these grades In our public grammar schools many boys and girls are kept along from year to year at great sacrifices on the part of parents and they should be allowed to devote their time to such studies as they will most need It would therefore be manifestly unfair to attempt more than the most rudimentary science work in those grades below the high school HENRY EDGERTON CHAPIN Ohio University Athens 0 THE IKONOMATIC METHOD IT is strange how difficult it seems for some writers to understand this early simple and widespread method of recording sounds Dr Thomas in Science Sept 8 presents a singular in stance of this when commenting on my explanation of the use of the turtlesign in the glyph for the Maya month name Kayab He says A compound of ak and yab cannot be a derivative of kay Of course not The nature of the ikonomatic theory forbids it for this has reference not at all to derivation but to other word or words with solely homophonic and not etyrnologic affini ties When there are so many examples of ikonomatic hiero FOSSIL RESINS This book is the result of an attempt to collect the scattered notices of fossil resins exclusive of those on amuber The work is of interest also on account of

stalk of maize or Indian corn failed to develop any ears at the regular places in the axils of the leaves but instead a single spike of pistillate flowers an ear appeared at the end of the central pedicel of the tassel This ear was about three inches in length and apparently well formed except that it lacked glumes So being exposed to the sun its color was light green The styles were perfectly developed and six inches to a foot in length The places of a few of the grains were occupied by staminate flowers Unfortunately this ear was not allowed to grow and I am unable to say whether it would have developed any perfect grains or not Is it a reversion to some ancient form or only an acci dental variation 0 H HERSHEY Freeport Ill A MOUSE DESTROYING ITS YOUNG I ONCE had an opportunity of

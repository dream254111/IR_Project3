PRIVATE CHARITY The purpose of this paper is the discussion of certain as pects of the study of economics especially this question Of what avail is the study of economics in the practical work of dealing with the problems of poverty  In putting the question thus I am perhaps making too great a con cession to those who demand from study of any sort im mediate results in hard cash or some equally obvious medium of exchange Such persons must always remain strangers to the pleasures of the pursuit of truth for its own sake rather than for the sake of the profit that it brings and strangers also to the real enjoyment derivable from the getting of knowledge ostentatiously useless Among the numerous inconsistencies in which we are apt to detect each other there is the inconsistency of feeling more interested and excited about things remote than about things near and at the same time demanding in connection with things near that every thought about them shall pay in some definite form We expend our compassion and our money in sending missionaries to the heathen of other coun tries or in alleviating the miseries of Russian Jews or Christians of the Lebanon while we manifest some impa tience at the demands upon our time and our purses for the service of our nextdoor neighbors The closer things are to our vital interests the less they interest us We see too much of them and have them thrust in our eyes until we are weary of them Things that are familiar bore us to death even though we may run the risk of their doing us to death in some other way The commonplace does not excite  Inaugural Lecture delivered before the University of Toronto February 6th 1893 34RELATION OF ECONOMIC STUDY TO CHARITY 35 us because it is commonplace What excites us is the novel the uncommon the unfamiliar Now here perhaps is the reason for the prevalence of the notion that political economy is  the dismal science Because it deals with the common place because it has to do with the familiar it is dismal and for no other reason It is true that economics opens a new window through which we may if we will look out upon life but the window is glazed with no garish colors there is no inviting label to make us aware of the treasures that lie withinThere is indeed a label which is tradition ally repellenthence the popular view which like most pop ular views is partly justified and partly erroneous that eco nomics is a dull affair that it is a study by dull people of dull people for dull people In so far as economics is regarded as dismal because of its relation to everyday life there is no help for it in so far as it is dismal because it throws little or no light upon practical problems there is no excuse for it Let us see how far and in what way the study of economics can throw light upon practical affairs But firstWhat is the relation between practical affairs and science of any kind  Is it not this  The region of practical affairs is the region of actionit is the region of art in the widest sense The region of science is the region of thought of action too no doubt in the sense of experiment and observation but still essentially the region of thought of logical continuity of guardedprogress from one proof to another of careful employment of theories and hypotheses In science we think and talk about its principles and classifications In art we have no occasion to talkwe have to do it Art like charity is to be done not to be talked about It were childish to discuss the oppo sition of science and art the opposition of theory which is in the region of science to practice which is in the region of art They are not opposed one is the complement or the fruition of the other Two theories may be opposed as two  Cf Helps Social Pressure p 25536 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY methods of practice may differ but there is no such oppo sition in reality as that which underlies the phrase  It is all very well in theory but it does not work out in practice Where this phrase is employed it will be found that there is something loose in the theory some error in the method of working in the practice or a total want of harmony between the conditions presupposed in the theory and those which actually accompany the practice In any case it is a loose and inaccurate phrase suggesting an opposition which has no counterpart in reality Science and art theory and practice are then not opposed though they are different One is con cerned with executive powerwith action with the emotions with the muscles and the other with thought with orderly arrangement with opinion with criticism Now though political economy is held by some to be an art as well as a science and perhaps rightly so held we must not confound the methods of the science of political economy with those of the art of political economy The science of political economy is the province of the economist the art of political economy is the province of the statesman or the practical administrator in civic national or inter national economic affairs The functions of the two classes of persons vary widely the two classes may be of mutual aid they may be of mutual hindrance The two functions require different orders of minddifferent aptitudes and different studies An excellent economist may make an indifferent states man not because what is all very well in theory will not work out in practice nor because the study of economics is of no use to a practical statesman but because the qual ities which have enabled the economist readily to grasp scientific principles are not those which as a statesman he is called upon to exercise Power to grasp scientific principles is a valuable quality in any man  but the statesman must have other qualities beside he must have the capacity and the habit of control he must have the magnetic power to bindRELATION OF ECONOMIC STUDY TO CHARITY 37 men together and to lead them his way He must be a man of action It were as unreasonable to demand of the economist administrative ability as to demand of the statesman intimate knowledge and grasp of scientific prin ciples Yet it is of the greatest importance for the economist to know and to know exhaustively the methods of practice however little he may share in them as it is for the states man to know and to know exhaustively current theories of political action however little he may be able or desirous to take a share in thinking them out The statesman politician town councilor or other rep resentative of the people who takes part in public economics and who nevertheless passes the study of economics by on the other side does so not because there is any opposition between sound theory and sound practice but rather because being a man of action he has no aptitude for abstract think ing and no wish to trouble about it The average man does indeed confine himself to one or other sphere of activityto practical government or to the study of systems of governments It will perhaps now be evident that objections to the econ omist because he is not practical are as valid as and no more valid than objections to the politician because he does not offer unbiased statements of theories of government instead of party speeches All this may seem rather elementary yet perhaps at no time has there been more need to emphasize this distinction between science and art than there is now If we are to build up a science of economics we must do so with our eye on but with our minds and voices away from the market place or the hustings We must have as little emotional interest in this or that theory or this or that policy as we should have in the examination of the evolutions of an oyster feeding under a microscope or in the discussion of the succession of the rocks in our neighborhood38 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY One has often tried to get some account of a battle or of a campaign from a private soldier but always without success He knows only marchings and countermarchings knows that one night he lay behind a hill and that the next morn ing his regiment charged over a plain This is all Any student of history knows more of battles than the soldiers who were there who are not students of history Thus in the turmoil of party politics in the midst of the struggles of Conservative and Liberal Republican and Demo crat N P and grit we here at least may be tranquil but observant The onlookers see most of the game This then is the r61e of economic science in the study of practical problems it is to give a man that sane and all round view which our dual system of party government tends to prevent him from having it is to show a man that the result of his action is at the best uncertain but that in proportion as step by step he reasons rightly and com prehensively he is the more likely to bring his action to good issues The study of economics makes a man modest would make even a politician modest For it brings him into the presence of the vast social and material forces with which in any action on the large scale he has to reckon It makes him realize how complex are the issues of life how numerous the crosscurrents how many forces may conspire to defeat his best aims And now in this attitude of theoretically the most perfect independence the most absolute indifference to the imme diate or remote results the uttermost absence of what the world calls sentiment let us regard the problems of poverty The first question we must ask about poverty isWhat is the meaning of the word  The dictionary does not help us much though it gives us a number of synonyms While every one has a general idea of what is meant by the expres sion we should find considerable difference in ideas as to what constitutes poverty If our scientific method is toRELATION OF ECONOMIC STUDY TO CHARITY 39 avail us at all it must first offer us the means of obtaining a more definite idea of the range and meaning of poverty than is offered to us in the language of everyday life It must provide us with some gauge for determining the degree of poverty and with some method by which we may discover where poverty comes in in the general scheme of things and what brings it there Like all early inquiries the early inquiries into poverty regarded it as an isolated fact which might be considered apart from the other facts of life and described it as a disease due to one or two specific causes and capable of being dealt with by one or two specific remedies But just as the study of physiologythe study of the normal action of the functions of the organism preceded pathology the study of the morbid action of the organs so the scientific study of diseases of the social organ ismsocial pathology we may call itwas necessarily pre ceded by study of the normal action of the economic functions It was necessary for us to have the study of the wealth of nations before we could have the study of the poverty of nations Technically the study of wealth is in the departments of production and distributionthe study of poverty is in the department of consumption Poverty is unsatisfied need The need is there the resources to satisfy it are not there Poverty is thus the condition of those who live at a low level whose food clothing and shelter are relatively inade quaterelatively inadequatefor if they were absolutely inadequate those who found themselves in that condition would perishinadequate relatively to the resources and consumption of those who are living at a higher level Poverty is simply the shady side of life and we cannot understand that unless we understand what life is and how it is now being lived by the people We must therefore  While inadequate production or a defective systetn of distribution may pro duce poverty neither will determine the depth and range of it40 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY look upon the study of poverty as being part of a large whole This is the central idea of the modem study of poverty It is a part of the study of the economic life of the people as a whole The methods that are now being employed in the study of poverty are simply the methods by which other sciences than economics have succeeded in enlarging the domain of knowledge viz observation induction and deduction The same order of skill with which beasts birds fishes and insects have been classified and arranged is at last being brought to bear upon mankind It is beginning to be possible to understand ourselves This orderly scientific method is rather the outcome of the general movement than the offspring of a single investiga tor It has indeed not sprung into existence in a moment but is rather a development many workers having been devoting themselves to a close and systematic study of economic life some of them even without being aware of the importance of the work they were doing I desire to suggest the need of adequate coordination of the results of such inquiries rather than to make a pre mature attempt at coordination It seems essential that the order of facts whose interpretation is desired should be widely understood This order of facts may perhaps be most effectually gathered from an account of two different but parallel investigations One of the leaders in the new method of the study of society was Frederic Le Play who in I829 began the series of family monographs which has been carried on by his disciples over the period of sixtyfour years that has elapsed since then It is not my purpose to give an ex haustive account of the method of Le Play I shall en deavor merely to indicate so much of it as may suffice to show its place in the study of the problem of poverty The chief feature in the method of Le Play is the compre hensiveness and minuteness of its view of social life ItRELATION OF ECONOMIC STUDY TO CHARITY 41 takes as its starting point the idea that the unit of society is the family and that the plexus of social forces can only be inductively studied by means of microscopic observation of a great number of these units The family then must be examined in detail with scrupulous care and its en vironment heredity and characteristics exhaustively cata logued Thus the three chief heads under which the investigation must be carried on are these I The external condition of the family 2 The status of the family with its record of heredity 3 The means and mode of existence of the family It is the business of the observer to note I THE EXTERNAL CONDITION OF THE FAMILY The Place of Habitation The features of the district the municipal government the provision of open spaces means of transit the physical characters of the district climate and natural resources The Chief IndustriesThe mode in which these are or ganizeddomestic or capitalistic exportation and importa tion from the district mode of land ownership division of property state of

his family for his own behoof It will be seen at once that here is something larger than simply an economic investigation it is rather a sociological investigation of the most comprehensive character It is indeed more than that for it involves as well topography the study of the physical environment While the details of the investigation are not such as might be undertaken by the economist in the strict rendering of the expression every one of the points has its bearing upon the economic condi tion The economic condition is indeed the resultant of these various forces and the condition cannot be understood without an investigation into the way in which it has been produced It may seem a hard saying yet it is true that what we know about the economic condition of the popula tions of our large cities is mere vague surmise depending upon the statements of a few persons in each city untrained as a rule in rigid methods of induction who form their conclusions from a field of observation limited by their own casual experience What we do need is detailed and con tinuous investigations along the lines I have sketched with competent coordination of the results The method of Le Play is no visionary scheme but is now being applied to the study of populations in several widely separated areas Le Plays own monographs deal with society in some of the European countries and in the East and the accumulation of material for coordination is still being car ried on by the Le Play societies44 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY By far the most important in point of positive results of the applications of modern scientific methods of research to the study of society and specially to the problems of pover ty is the work of Mr Charles Booth upon London Mr Booth has carried on his investigation independently of the Le Play method and on different though somewhat similar but less systematic lines He has conceived the idea of making an exhaustive study of the population of London from an economic point of view With this object he has already by the aid of an army of assistants thoroughly ex plored a great part of London He has made a careful investigation of a vast number of families and has gleaned not all but a large number of the relevant facts about them He has classified these facts and drawn certain provisional conclusions from them His work is indeed in most ways a perfect model of what such an investigation should be The conditions of each great city are so different from those of every other that not until we have before us similar in vestigations of other cities shall we be entitled to form definite conclusions about the poverty in them Early in Mr Booths investigations he found it necessary to devise a classification which might serve as a standard for the measurement of different degrees of poverty The standard is as follows  A The lowest class of occasional laborers loafers and semicriminals B Casual earningsvery poor C Intermittent earnings D Small irregular earnings Together the poor E Regular standard earningsabove the line of poverty F Higher class labor G Lower middle class H Upper middle class These divisions are of necessity arbitrary In different places or at different periods in the same place they would be denoted by different pecuniary amounts Each divisionRELATION OF ECONOMIC STUDY TO CHARITY 45 is however sufficiently permanent in its central idea for prac tical purposes In London in I88689 when these inves tigations were made the  poor  Classes C and D comprised those who have an income of from 475 to 5 IO 18s to 21s per week for a moderate family Class B comprises those who fall below this amount  The  poor  may be described as living in a state of struggle to obtain the necessaries of life while the very poor live in a state of chronic want Here then we have a gauge by which to measure the standard of comfort of the people The gauge is readily adjustable to any locality What we need to do is by a general inquiry to fix the amount of the money Wages ap plicable to each class with the relative numbers in family and then proceed to discover by minute inquiry what the standard of comfort is in each family over the different quarters of a city This inquiry involves a vast amount of time and trouble and must be repeated at moderate intervals but without such an inquiry our knowledge of the people of their standard of comfort of what constitutes poverty and the extent of it is quite vague and indefinite The results of Mr Booths investigations into the economic condition of a certain portion of the people of London re veal many interesting points In the district chosen by him for investigation in the first instance East London and Hackney comprising an area of about seven square miles in the east of London bounded on the south by the river Thames on the west by the city and on the east by the Poplar marshes there are about 90000ooo inhabitants Of these 648 per cent were above the line of poverty and 352 per cent were below it Of this 352 per cent or 3I5000 persons below the line of poverty only 6000 were inmates of institu tions so that over 300000 persons were living in poverty in this areaonethird of the population But of these 300000 persons living in poverty I28000 or nearly onehalf were earning regular low wages 74000 C Booth Life and Labor in East London Vol I P 3346 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY or about onefourth were making irregular earnings iooooo or onethird were making casual earnings while IIooo or 4 per cent of the poor or i 4 per cent of the whole population of the district belonged to the lowest class of occasional laborers loafers and semicriminals Here then it is clear that in studying the problems of poverty we have to deal not alone with those who claim public relief as paupers or who claim private charity as beggars but with the great army from which these classes are constantly recruited the army of those who live at or under the line of povertya great army living at a depressed rate of life and tending to reduce the vitality of the whole population But Mr Booth has done something more than merely discover the extent of poverty He has made inquiry into its causes The causes of poverty turn out not only to be numerous but interactive There is the principal cause and the contributing cause there is the cause and the effect visible in the same person or in two or more persons Thus the poverty of a child may not be due to any fault on the part of the child but to one or the other parent or both This strictly empirical investigation of Mr Booths reveals the following causes of poverty operating as principal or contributory causes Crime vice drink laziness pauper associations heredity mental disease temper incapacity early marriage large family extravagance lack of work unemployed trade misfortune restlessness roving tramp no relations death of husband desertion abandoned death of father or mother sickness accident ill luck old age It is difficult to give a fair idea of Mr Booths investiga tions from his voluminous tables But out of Iooo paupers in Stepney whose cases were carefully investigated individ ually it was found that old age was the chief principal and contributory causeRELATION OF ECONOMIC STUDY TO CHARITY 47 Old age was the principal cause in 328 per cent of the cases Sickness       267 per cent Drink       126  Accident      47 Trade misfortune     44 Pauper associations and heredity  I As contributory causes Old age contributed of the cases  17 per cent Pauper associations and heredity contributed chiefly with sickness drink and old age as principal causes of the cases   17 Drink contributory cause with sickness and old age as principal causes accounted for the pauperism of     2  While sickness accounted for an equal number Altogether drink is returned as responsible directly as principal or indirectly as contributory cause for 25 per cent of the cases Mr Booth however says the proportion is less than might have been expected and it is probable that closer research into the circumstances and history of these people if it could be made might disclose a greafer connec tion than here appears between pauperism and the public house It is however noteworthy that the results shown agree on the whole with those of the two inquiries I have myself previously made into apparent causes of poverty The first regarding 4000 cases of poverty known by certain of the School Board visitors gave 13 to 14 per cent as one to drink the lighter percentage being for the greater degree of poverty The second regarding about 500ooo people living poor and irregular lives showed 10 and I per cent dropping to only 5 per cent for about another 3000 who though poor were more regularly employed In St Pancras workhouse the number of cases in which pauperism was due to old age as a principal cause was 234 per cent48 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY To sickness      20 7 per cent To drink      219 To laziness      6 To mental derangement   43 In St Pancras workhouse about the same number of cases were investigated but they included a smaller number of permanent paupers than the Stepney house whose figures were first quoted The current cases exhibit the largest amount of drunkenness The ins and outs or those who go to the workhouse for a while and then leave are specially not able for drunken habits Fortythree per cent of the  ins and outs  were obliged to seek refuge in the workhouse on account of drink The details of Mr Booths conclusions are to be found in his smaller volume on Pauperism His main conclusion is that old age is the most frequent principal cause of pauper ism and he suggests as a remedy for this cause a national scheme of endowment of old age Old age then stands first sickness next and then comes drink Supremely valuable as Mr Booths work is it stops short of a full revelation of the reason why we have this mass of poverty It discloses the immediate causes of poverty it does not disclose the remoter causes of it For the empirical investigation of these we must turn to the more comprehen sive method of Frederic Le Play the close study of the family each family the subject of a separate monograph nar rating its record as a family its ethnical position its migra tions its industrial status its sources of income and methods of expenditure Study of poverty in the economic sense is thus a branch of the study of economic lifea branch involving special methods of research and investigation special methods of record and generalization Not that this can be done easily on the contrary even as regards pauperism a detailed investigation into the record of  C Booth  Pauperism A PictureRELATION OF ECONOMIC STUDY TO CHARITY 49 any considerable number of pauper families might be almost impossible Yet such an investigation would probably show us that poverty especially in England is not wholly a creation of today but is largely a legacy from the past One cannot read the economic history of the country without feeling convinced that the underpaid and stunted weavers and mechanics of the beginning of the cen tury and the halfstarved agricultural laborers who sys tematically received part of their wages out of the poor rates have taken a frightful revengehave bequeathed not wealth which moth and rust might corrupt but poverty which flourishes in corruption Neglect in the past of obvious physiological laws is responsible for much of the poverty of today In a very real sense the sins of the fathers are visited upon the children even unto the third and fourth generation Whole nations may suffer for some class sins of a bygone age Much of the low level of modern life is due we can hardly doubt to causes reaching far back in the history of each racesome of them not indeed so very far back but still behind the immediate range of vision Thus much of the low level of modern life is due to the existence of a definite nucleus of hereditary pauperism This hereditary pauperism is due again in a large measure no doubt to the modes of dispensing public and private charity which have endured more or less from the middle ages until now And the unfortunate and disagreeable fact emerges in most in quiries on the subject that not a few of the charitable agencies and not a few charitable individuals are steadily adding to the ranks of professional pauperism by an illconsidered sys tem of doles It is hard to resist the moving of the bowels of compassion and to refuse to give a coin to a beggar but after all the giving of the coin is an easy salve to the con science It is much easier for example than taking pains to discover the exact reason for the poverty of the beggar and setting about to devise means at once to save the man50 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY and prevent so far as may be future cases of the same order I need not weary you with criticisms of the results of indis criminate alms giving These have been urged over and over again by every charity organizer from Defoe in his essay  On Giving Alms no Charity down to our own day Much of the misery is due also no doubt to the economic changes that in many countries have transformed agricultural into industrial and industrial into commercial communities What is popularly known as moder progress  consists in changes of this sort Some of these changes probably most of them are due to imperious forces which will not be gain said are due to physical changes climatic and other are due to pressure of population or external or internal influ ences too varied to enumerate While the main facts of these changes are probably inevitable because they are due to forces which it were useless to fight against much may be done to mitigate the severity of a change to those who are victimized by it Failure to do this by some means or other by voluntary private action or by compulsory State or municipal action inevitably results in accession to the ranks of those who have gone down in the struggle with the new forces Such victims of what is called progress where they do not die live to produce an enfeebled and deteriorated generation Successive changes of this kind have resulted in the casting off as by centrifugal force from the round of industry of great numbers of men and women Thus apart altogether from personal misconduct which counts for much but which is often traceable to inherited tenden cies there is in modem industrial life an excessive develop ment of this form of struggle one of the forms of the  struggle for existence which goes on on all the rungs and from top to bottom of the biological ladder It is a struggle of pro cesses as well as of men in which the processes often victim ize the men who devise them It may be that nothing can meanwhile be done to mitigate the severity of the effects of these changes in general or on the large scale but muchRELATION OF ECONOMIC STUDY TO CHARITY 51 may be donemuch is being done on the small scale Manufacturers today who introduce new machinery are as a rule more considerate of their workers than they used to be partly perhaps owing to the moralization of the em ployer and partly to the combination of the workers Thus we have witnessed during the past few years many industrial changes and no doubt much victimization but probably less serious suffering than might otherwise have been the case An exhaustive examination of economic life would involve inquiry as to how far what is known as the factory system is associated with the development of poverty and as to what are the precise relations between the growth of towns and the growth within them of a proletariat class or landless work less class probably partly inheriting their inefficiency Apart from the general influence of the factory system upon industrial society there is the influence of the com mercial system The huge circulatory system of modern commerce works smoothly for a while and then from an obscure or undiscoverable cause is suddenly or gradually constricted at some point while the whole system inti mately sympathetic as it is is affected by the constriction These fluctuations in commerce produce corresponding fluctuations in industry and we have the alternate phenomena of inflation and depression of trade Thus one of the results of the departure now going on in a greater or lesser degree in most civilized countries from the stable basis of agriculture to the fluctuating basis of trade  is the irregularity of employment Exact figures in this connection are hard to get as yet although they are being more industriously collected now than ever before By way of illustration we may take the record of a period of depression where of course this condition of irregularity is most mani fest Of 30000 workmen in the East of London whose cases were investigated in 1887 14ooo or 47 per cent had been working continuously for six months or more while52 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY 29 per cent had been working only two months in the aggre gate out of the six and 23 per cent had been idle for various periods extending from two to ten weeks that is that 53 per cent of these 30000 workmen belonging to thirtyfour differ ent classes of occupations and a much larger number of indi vidual occupations were exposed to serious irregularities of employment Of these 3 per cent only were permanently disabled and 3 per cent were temporarily disabled and were therefore not physically equal to manual labor The returns of trade unions illustrate the same condition Irregu larity of employment leads directly or indirectly to poverty The alert and shrewd among workmen reckon upon and prepare for these periods of depression They insure against them by actual saving and by paying into a trade society It may be held therefore that in some industries wages are higher than they would otherwise be were it not for these fluctuations The trade union is largely to be credited with providing a compensation balance which steadies the industrial system and prevents it from feeling the full effects of the fluctuations of commerce Beneath the industrious and provident workman and forming a large class in the communities of the Old World and in some of those of the New there are the men who whenever the first wave of depression comes find themselves without employment The unskillful the lazy the illtem pered for this as every careful observer knows is quite a large cause of poverty the dissolute are naturally dismissed first while the skillful active and goodtempered steady men remain till the last The class thus indicated form the ranks of the unem ployed whenever depression in trade causes a diminution of employment We may now divide each of Mr Booths classes A B C and D into subclasses In each we will find  Parliametitary Paper C 5228 1887 P 2RELATION OF ECONOMIC STUDY TO CHARITY 53 I The aged 2 The insane 3 The sick including a Those suffering from diseases due to drunkenness b Those suffering from other diseases 4 The ablebodied unemployed Let us enumerate rather than examine the methods adopted in dealing with these classes There are three main methods of general application and in general use These are I Compulsory rating for State or district relief with ad ministration by nominated or popularly elected representa tion as in England 2 Voluntary Associations as in Canada 3 A union of these as in the case of the poor by a State church or as in what is known as the Elberfeld system Private or unorganized charity cannot fairly be classed as a system although it is possible that more is done both of good and of evil by private charity than by any of the systems Ju dicious private charity may render unnecessary the establish ment of a public system while the establishment of a public system may on the otherhand tend to stamp out private charity If we could be quite certain that every man had a perfectly alert regard to his own interest and the most ample oppor tunity to secure his interest together with a perfectly keen sense of his responsibilities and duties there would be theo retic justification for sternly refusing relief of any kind But we know that men do not grow that way and that there fore however unfortunate in many ways it may be for society society must make good the shortcomings of the individual for no other reason so far as society is concerned than the desire for selfpreservation It is true that the effect of this action of society is to transfer the responsibility from the individual to society But since in the cases concerned the personal responsibility is not recognized there is a clear gain in the recognition of it as a social responsibility54 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY As regards the aged sick and insane poor granted the duty of maintaining them the question isHow is it to be done most efficiently  By indoor maintenance in the poor house or asylum or by outdoor relief in the shape of allow ances pensions or otherwise In the cases of the insane and in the cases of those who are sick from infectious diseases there is everywhere a defi nite tendency to treat these in a hospital or asylum While the expenses of administration vary widely there can be little doubt that for the sick and insane indoor treatment is on the whole more efficient and less expensive than any other method would be The establishment of asylums with farms attached for inebriates has been carried to some extent in Germany and elsewhere but it would be premature to express any judg ment upon the results It is difficult for the authorities even in Germany to keep the traces of those who pass through the asylums and leave and in the absence of definite knowledge of this sort conclusions would be misleading Taken generally and efficient administration being assumed the evidence seems to be in favor of indoor treat ment of the sick and insane As regards the aged the evi dence is by no means so clearly in favor of indoor treatment The policy of the English poor law until I834 was wholly in the direction of outdoor relief but after the Report of the Commission of that year condemning outdoor relief on account of the serious abuses which had crept into the poor law administration the policy was changed Gradually the amount expended in outdoor relief has diminished and the amount expended in indoor relief has increased You will not expect me to discuss at this moment the de tails of so large a question but it may fairly be concluded from the evidence in England Germany and America that the question as to which means of relief should be adopted  As in the Salem Colony for Inebriates

principle The important thing is to know precisely what the conditions are Several schemes associated more or less definitely with the question of outdoor relief have recently been urged upon public attention The National Insurance system of Germany and the National Pension schemes of Mr Chamberlain and of Mr Charles Booth are really systems of outdoor relief The national insurance system has not had a very long trial but it would appear that considerable difficulties are being met with Malingering is it is understood going far to make the system unworkable without regulations of addi tional severity While malingering applies rather to an insurance scheme than to a pension scheme and is moreover a practical difficulty that may be coped with a rather serious theoretic objection lies against all pension schemes Do they not really amount to a rate in aid of wages Do not pensioners now hire themselves for less than men who are not pensioners can subsist upon and so tend to diminish the rate of wages of their grade of labor It may be that a national pension scheme would have this result on a large scale unless the age at which the pension was payable were fixed beyond the age at which the average man would be likely to work There are besides the diffi culties of dealing with the existing pension agencies especially the friendly societies the difficulty of collecting a special rate for the purpose from each individual or of dispensing with a special pension payment and throwing the total cost upon the national revenue as a whole These difficulties seem large perhaps they are not insurmountable The crux of the poverty question in Europe just now is the treatment of the ablebodied unemployed The numbers of these to be dealt with at any moment even in a time of depression are very indefinite They fluctuate from day to56 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY day from hour to hour At one moment the ranks of the unemployed are mainly filled by industrious workmen who would work if they could get work to do at another with loafers who hang on the skirts of every relieving agency and are not only kept alive but formed into a compact class of professional deadbeats How is the first class to be sifted from the second for obviously the kind of treatment they need is widely different from the kind of treatment which the others need The aspect which this part of the problem of poverty pre sents to most persons is this Here are some thousands or some hundreds of thousands of mouths to be fed but these mouths have intimate association with twice as many hands to feed them What is wrong that the hands cannot feed the mouths Now this question which might be put by a child which is indeed often put by children involves no simple answer I have already sufficiently insisted upon the unity of economic life to make that clear If all these hundreds of thousands of workless men were transported to another planet or to some neglected spot upon this one and if their labors were organized spontaneously or otherwise they might work for each other and get on quite merrily but we may do more harm than good by attempting to force the unemployed back into the industrial system If we get them to make things for us which we do not want we simply waste our money while if we get them to make things for us that we do want we simply transfer our demand from one set of workmen whom we are just now employing to those new comers who want employment We do not make any fresh demand for labor we simply transfer our demand from one group to another and in so far as we do so we tend to impoverish one set of men while we enrich another set If we were sure that we were distributing our demand more uniformly and with greater benefit to society than before there might be something to be said for our action but canRELATION OF ECONOMIC STUDY TO CHARITY 57 we be sure that we are doing so Now here we might arrive at an impasse but there is no need for that We cannot remove our unemployed to another planet yet we may find some place on our own which is not occupied we may plant them down there and let them produce for each other If we can get them simply to produce for each other without coming into the market with their products subsidized by our charity in any way there will be a clear gain in the production They will cease to be a charge upon society They will become producers Nor need there necessarily be any emigration Migration from the overcrowded centres to the neglected spots of the country with efficient organi zation of labor that is all Now all this is exceedingly attractive I will not weary you by reciting a rather long list of authors within the past two or three centuries who thought that they had found social salvation along these lines nor with any detailed account of the numerous experiments that have been tried The oldest modem experiment is the old English Poor Laws the largest modern experiment is the German Labor Colony System The old English Poor Law was in many ways a failure largely perhaps for the reason alleged by Fielding that while the statutes prescribed what was to be done they did not tell how to do it At any rate the House of Industry and the Parish farm after a chequered career disappeared and it was not until the establishment of the Dutch Labor Colonies early in the century that the idea of work not alms was again carried out on any con siderable scale What our study of poverty reveals to us in this connection is this That of those who have been born into or who have been sinking into poverty there are some not relatively a large number in a new country but even there a number fluctuating with the fluctuations of trade who are unable to get any one to organize their labor for them that is to em ploy them and who are also unable to do so for themselves58 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY The question is should society undertake this organization should it undertake to do what the industrial system has failed to do should it accept the responsibility of glossing over what may turn out to be defects in the industrial sys tem by regimenting its failures A sufficient number of persons in Germany have taken this view of social responsibility to establish twentyfour farms upon which all comers may work and be fed No work no food but still to all comers work and food Those who are unable to get any one to organize their labor may walk into the farm and forthwith have their labor organized on subsistence terms Vagrancy is strictly put down in Germany and the strict observance of the law is rendered possible by the existence of those institutions in which a man buffeted and shipwrecked inwardly and outwardly as the expressive phrase of one of the reports has it may spend a few months of healthy life and then return to competitive industry The advantages of the system appear to outweigh the dis advantages so far as Germany is concerned A similar sys tem exists in Holland and an experiment in the same direction is being made in France In England General Booths farm at Hadleigh is a labor colony of the same order though it performs also the function of a place for training emigrantst How far the latter function may usefully be conjoined with the other functions of the institution is very doubtful In a certain number of cases of lapse no doubt good emigrants may be found but the presumption is against a nation discharging upon the shores of its colonies or of other nations the products of the sinister side of its industrial and social life The farm colony pure and simple may be said to fill two functions both of them desirable up to a certain point i  For a recent account of these colonies see  Report on Labour Colonies by J Mavor J R Motion J Speir and R P Wright Glasgow 1892 t See Report cited aboveRErATION OF ECONOMIC STUDY TO CHARITY 59 It fills the function of a sanatorium where a man who has been broken in health on account of want of employment or otherwise may recover in the fresh air in the wholesome and regular diet and discipline of the country colony the spring which he has lost in the city 2 It fills the function of organizers of labor for those who cannot organize their own It seems likely that these two functions will have to be divided the first to be undertaken by the exist ing colonies the second by other colonies to be established for permanent occupation by colonists cultivating upon a co operative or peasant proprietary basis In any case the colonies must do good in so far as they take off from the slums of the cities year by year crowds of men who are rapidly sinking into degradation and in so far as they make men of them They will also avoid injurious influences upon the economic conditions of society in so far as they are rigidly selfcontained that is in so far as they avoid sending their subsidized products into the market for sale For the rest farm colonies though conceivably an efficient have proved to be a rather expensive form of poor relief Now where economic students may most efficiently be of service in practical problems is in thoroughly and system atically mastering the conditions Be it ours to study and so far as we may interpret the facts as we see them We hear occasionally the phrase  You are disobeying the laws of political economy If by the laws of political economy are meant the laws of the action of the social forces these laws are no more to be disobeyed than the law of gravi tation or the law of expansion of gases What ought to be said is You are disregarding the lessons of history It is mainly from disregarding the plain lessons of history frequently from ignorance of these that men go wrong in political action What we need in the study of economics to avail us in practical affairs isinsight insight and always insight To get at the inwardness of a matter of ancient history60 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY when all the elements of it that have come down to us through the ages have fallen into line and when we may see them in perspective is fairly hard even for the most com petent student it is difficult for us for example to trace the early stages of landholding in England or to discover the real meaning of the steps by which the English laborer emerged from serfdom  but it is still more difficult for us to see the real bearing of what goes on under our very eyes to see with entirely clear and disinterested vision the direction of the forces that are weaving in the  roaring loom of tile JAMES MAVOR University of Toronto

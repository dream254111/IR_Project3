j100133,The Condor,1362277,From Field and Study,i259186,FROM FIELD AND STUDY Grammatical Errors in Vernacular NamesMany times we see earnest recommen dations in these columns from ardent ornithologists advocating changes in the vernacu lar names of birds the present names of which seem to be misleading or erroneous Two apparently glaring grammatical errors seem to have escaped notice up to now but here we have them Most birds have qualifying names which tend to point out some peculiarity in the228 THE CONDOR Vol XVIII bird which distinguishes it from its relatives in the same genus Where the character is one of habit or pertains to its notes and song the present participle is the form the adjective takes Thus we have Laughing Gull Cackling Goose Whooping and Whist ling Swans Whooping Crane Anteating Woodpecker Wormeating Warbler Warbling Vireo and Mourning Warbler Departures from this practice occur in such names as Melodious Grassquit Clapper Rail and Trumpeter Swan but these forms seem permis sible There are two names however which are very much off color Screech Owl and the Song Sparrow It seems that aside from the grammatical error committed the more prevalent practice should have dictated that these names be Screeching Owl and Sing ing Sparrow Screech Owl and Song Sparrow seem good enough names through long usage but witness how ludicrous the above list of birds would appear were we to change their names to agree with the form expressed in the case of the owl and the sparrow We would have Laugh Gull Cackle Goose Whoop and Whistle Swans Whoop Crane Warble Vireo Mourn Warbler Melody Grassquit Clap Rail and Trumpet Swan Nouns are used as adjectives but the meaning is totally different from that in which the present participial form is used Thus where we have cowbarn tirerack shotgun or iron knife the meaning is a barn for a cow a rack for tires a gun for shot and a knife of iron simply a phrase shortened into two nouns one of which is used as an adjective The meaning of Screech Owl and Song Sparrow is obviously an owl which screeches and a sparrow which sings and not an owl for screeches nor a sparrow for or of song So when we get around to doing any changing of names let us set these right before the Gull Swan and Goose laugh whoop and cackle at the poor little owl and sparrow J R PEMBERTON Colton California Are there Two Forms of the Bryant Marsh Sparrow in San Francisco County Joseph Mailliards note on the Bryant Marsh Sparrow in a recent issue of THE CON 1or suggests a solution to what has been a puzzling problem to me for some time I have found the Bryant Marsh Sparrow breeding on the Islais Marsh south of the Po trero district But there are other birds apparently of this species averaging somewhat lighter however found resident in the Presidio on the Ingleside Golf Links and high up the slopes of Twin Peaks I have noted them many times during the breeding season at the two last named stations Most of the books speak of this sparrow as though it were found nowhere else than on the salicornia marshes near sea level It is my opinion that there is an upland form of Passerculus sandwichensis bryanti which verges toward P s alaudinus and that it ranges from Humboldt County south at least to the Transition area of San Francisco County I may add that I noted this same lightcolor Bryant Marsh Sparrow last July on the uplands of western Sonoma County some miles from the seaW A SQUIRES San Francisco California Caspian Tern in the San Joaquin ValleyAt the time of the appearance of the Sep tember 1916 number of THE CONDOR I had what appeared to be in newspaper parlance a scoop on the Caspian Tern Sterna caspia in the way of a late summer or early fall interior record and had a short article upon this subject scrolled out waiting only the disappearance of this species from the scene before finishing it up and sending it in to the Editor But meanwhile the abovementioned number of our journal came out con taining John G Tylers Supplementary List of Birds of the Fresno District in which there are several records of this species However as Grinnells Distributional List of the Birds of California gives this bird as a Rather rare winter visitant and migrant both coastwise and in the interior with a few records following most of which are winter with only two spring and no fall records it should be worthy of note that several individuals have been paying a prolonged visit to the Rancho Dos Rios near the mouth of the Tuolumne River Stanislaus County as many as a dozen having been seen at one time and two specimens taken for positive identification It happened this summer that some seepage waterwas left on our ranch in a de pressed piece of ground several acres in extent and the resulting shallow ponds proved very attractive to several species of aquatic birds Among these the Caspian Tern choseNov 1916 FROM FIELD AND STUDY 229 these ponds for a temporary abiding place from which it sallied forth from time to time to scan the neighboring lagoons for stray fish floating on the surface of their waters flying up and down each lagoon or lakelet for a few turns picking up a tidbit here and there and finally returning to its resting place at the shallow ponds For several years past large terns have been noticed in the spring mostly in May flying north in groups of two or three some days quite a number passing by perhaps half a dozen being in sight at once But no opportunity ever offered for procuring a specimen for positive identification although there seemed but little doubt as to the spe cies being Sterna caspia It always happened that when my gun was near the birds were too far away to reach and when they were near enough the gun was too far away Re turning in the fall the same thing happened This fall however the large terns were first noticed on September 4 when three or four were seen flying up and down a charm ing little lake upon the shore of which the main house is situated Retiring shortly from this lake the birds flew over the shallow ponds spoken of above which they evi dently made their headquarters For several weeks after this date some of these birds were always in evidence while their rather harsh cry or else a sort of gentle little short and trilling whistle could be heard not only at any time of daylight but even in the late dusk of the evening They were very wary and the chances of happening within gunshot greatly against the col lector but two specimens were finally secured proving their identity beyond a doubt On October 6 there were still three or four of the birds on the placeJosEPH MAILLIARD San Francisco California Nesting Habits of the Virginia Rail in Mariposa County CaliforniaOn June 5 1916 while mowing grass in a small marsh on our home place on Smith Creek near Coulter ville Mariposa County California my father discovered the nest and eggs of a Virginia Rail Rallus virginianus The nest was a towerlike structure composed of flat marsh grasses It measured eight inches in height and the same in diameter The ten brown and lilacspotted eggs were just beginning to be incubated As compared with eggs of other birds nesting in this vicinity they resemble most closely those of the Valley Quail but are proportionately longer and darker colored The grass clump in which the nest was situated was not disturbed in mowing and near by there was a high bank from which the nest could be easily observed When anyone ap proached the vicinity of the nest the incubating bird would slip quietly off but some times she could be heard splashing through the water as she ran Usually she did not go more than six feet from the nest and would then stand quietly in the grass where she would appear like nothing more than a dark shadow Whenever any one of us would go near the nest which we did almost every day the female would utter a low clucking sound Nothing was seen of the male until June 18 when as we approached the nest an ear piercing scream came from him as he stood some distance away in the marsh grass This whistle was answered by a similar but softer note from his mate The male showed himself only momentarily as he skulked through the grass as if attempting to distract our attention from the nest On June 19 there were six coal black young in the nest They had blackringed pink bills and their feet were very large in proportion to their bodies Now the demeanor of the female changed She forgot her shyness and walked out in the open within three feet of where we stood She fluffed up her feathers after the manner of a sitting hen and uttered many clucks and whistles which were answered by the shrill whistle of the male He was not so brave as she and did not show himself except at intervals On this same day several of the young clambered out of the nest into the water We replaced them and quitted the vicinity so as not to disturb the family Later in the day we vis ited the nest again and found the female absent Soon the male whistled his mate an swered and she soon appeared from a grass clump swimming and wading across a bit of open water to the nest By the evening of the nineteenth another egg had hatched and on the morning of the twentieth two more The last egg hatched on the afternoon of the twentieth On the morning of June 21 the family had departed and we saw no more of them save for one that showed itself for a moment in the marsh one day late in JulyDoxALD D McLEAN Coulterville California230 THE CONDOR Vol XVIII Peculiar Nesting Site of Ash throated FlycatcherWe had just discovered a Phainopeplas nest in a pepper tree along side of a road in Linda Vista four miles west of Pasa dena California when a women ap peared and asked us what we were doing After explaining to her sat isfaction that we did not intend to disturb any of the nests in her vicinity she gained sufficient confidence in us to ask the identity of a bird nesting in her yard Investigation disclosed an Ashthroated Flycatcher Myiar chus cinerascens cinerascens carry ing food in its bill to a peculiarly sit uated nest At the northeast corner of the house a fourinch galvanized pipe about three feet long had been soldered to the outlet of the eaves trough in order to prevent rain water from falling against the house In the elbow of this threefoot length of pipe a pair of Ashthroated Flycatch ers had built their nest see fig 56 We were told that in build ing the nest the birds first entered the open end of the Fig 56 DRAIN PIPE USED AS A NESTING SITE BY A PAIR OF ASHITHROATED FLYCATCHERS pipe but later used the entrance through the eave trough which was little more than two and onehalf inches in diameter At the time of our visit June 23 1916 the nest contained young which by their calls must have been partly feathered Although the Crested Flycatcher of the East Myiarchus crinitus is known to nest occasionally in an artificial environment this is the first instance that has come to our notice of the Ash throated Flycatcher with its notably retiring disposition taking kindly enough to civi lization to nest in a door yardHAROLD C BRYANT and AMY M BRYANT Berkeley Cali fornia Bird Notes from Palo Verde Imperial County CaliforniaQuerquedula cyanoptera Cinnamon Teal On June 30 1916 I was out in the flooded country when I found a ducks nest with seven creamy white eggs No bird was on the nest but there were lots of duck tracks in the mud close by The nest was under a small bush on the top of a levee about three feet from the waters edge It was not very well lined but contained some grass and a few feathers On July 2 I was back but the young had hatched on looking around I saw six young with the mother teal trying to get them away The old male was on hand and tried to lead me away with the brokenwing game The young were seen often after that but would always be in the brush Porzana carolina Sora Rail One pair was seen all summer in a large bunch of tules on the lagoon about half a mile south of Palo Verde no nest found Plegadis guarauna Whitefaced Glossy Ibis Himantopus mezicanus Blacknecked Stilt Both these were seen all summer from May 12 till the fall migration but no nests were found though some young birds were seen flying around Ozyechus vociferus Killdeer Several nests were found and lots of young seenin the flooded country during high water Melopelia asiatica Whitewinged Dove No nests were found this year but several seen in 1915 This year the birds were mostly back on the mesa or along the edge of the valley They may have moved back on account of the flood Chaemepelia passerina pallescens Mexican Ground Dove Two nests found in 1915 Only one pair of birds seen regularly this summer Several seen in August and Septem ber in the grass flats where the overflow had beenNov 1916 FROM FIELD AND STUDY 231 Parabuteo unicinctus harrisi Harris Hawk July 25 1916 I saw four fullgrown young not able to fly They were in a cottonwood in a small marsh about two miles south of Palo Verde Pyrocephalus rubinus mezicanus Vermilion Flycatcher On April 7 1916 I found a nest north of the store in a screwbean overhanging the water There were two eggs in it about ready to hatch The young grew up and left the nest I also found a nest back of the schoolhouse on April 16 with fairly fresh eggs The birds were ready to fly on May 12 On passing the nest north of the store on June 1 I looked in and was surprised to see three more young birds in the nest and on looking into the nest back of the schoolhouse found it to contain three eggs In both cases the nest was twice used in the same seasonLEO WILEY Palo Verde California Another Record of the Wood Ibis in CaliforniaOn Sunday morning August 13 1916 while returning north on the Santa FI6 from San Diego I was surprised and de lighted to see a flock of about twenty Wood Ibises Mycteria americana I was sitting on the rear platform of the observation car and saw the flock just after our train had crossed the broad delta of a small stream near Oceanside The birds were flying from the ocean inland up the rather broad valley of the practically dry stream Although I had not seen a live Wood Ibis since August 1888 when I saw seven on the lower Wabash I at once recognized these birds Their heavy wingflaps their white bodies and black wings could not be mistaken Messrs Grinnell and Daggett saw a flock in the same place August 5 1902 see CONDOR v 1903 p 18BARTON WARREN EVERMANN San Francisco Califor nia The Alaska Waterthrush in Marin County CaliforniaAugust 13 1916 I took a trip to Muir Woods in company with several friends While hiking along what is known as the Bootjack Trail I suddenly came upon an Alaska Waterthrush Seiurus novebo racensis notabilis perched on a large boulder near a stream At this point there was a great deal of underbrush and ferns along the banks and several small cataracts in the stream Upon catching sight of me the bird uttered small chirps and continually tee tered and dipped from side to side I was able to approach within a few feet of it and noted that the general color was brownish with black streakings on the breast and a whitish line through the eye After a few minutes another one appeared and the two flew into the underbrush The white stripe through the eye and the teetering motion like that of the American Dipper to my mind makes the identification of this bird unmis takable As there seem to be only four other records of the occurrence of this species within the State I thought that my finding it in Marin County might be of some interest HAROLD E HANSEN San FTrancisco California The Dwarf Screech Owl in the State of WashingtonUnless it be for an occasional sight record I believe the Dwarf Screech Owl Otus flammeolus idahoensis has sel dom been recorded in Washington It gives me great pleasure therefore to report the capture of an adult female at Kiona Benton County Washington by Mr F R Decker of that place An examination showed it to be beyond much doubt a breeding bird The only possible nesting sites in the vicinity were numerous holes made by Bank Swallows etc in a large sandy cliff so it is possible that this bird may use something besides holes in trees as a place for raising its young The specimen was taken on May 29 1916 and is now in the collection of Mr D E Brown at Seattle WashingtonJ H BOWLES Tacoma Washington Cleaning Skulls and Skeletons a Supplementary NoteSince the publication of the description of the process of cleaning skulls and disarticulated

for a solution containing two quarts of ammonia and six gallons of water No harmful effects have been caused by the use of a very con centrated solution of Cresol Cresol costs about thirtyfive cents a

Western Sonoma County CaliforniaI spent the month of July 1916 in western Sonoma County with headquarters at Camp Meeker Several trips were made into various parts of the county These trips covered pretty thoroughly the territory from Santa Rosa to Cazadero thence west to the ocean and south to the Marin County line The following list does not contain all the birds noted only those are mentioned whose occurrence in the territory explored seems worthy of note Lunda cirrhata Tufted Puffin One flew out from under an overhanging rocky cliff near the mouth of the Russian River July 17 Oceanodroma kaedingi Kaeding Petrel A bird believed to be of this species cer tainly a petrel was seen to fly out of a cleft in a high rocky cliff about one mile south of the mouth of the Russian River on the same day that the puffin was seen It is pos sible that a few of these birds nested there earlier in the season Mergus serrator Redbreasted Merganser A male and female seen on the Russian River about a mile from the ocean on July 17 This duck is a common winter visitant to these shores but its occurrence in midJuly seems rather unusual Actitis macularia Spotted Sandpiper Several seen on the Russian River between Monte Rio and Duncans Mills July 10 Two young not yet able to fly but abundantly able to run were seen Columba fasciata fasciata Bandtailed Pigeon Two were seen on Willow Creek July 17 More were heard hooting in the redwoods along the same stream Pandion haliaetus carolinensis American Osprey One was seen about a mile from the mouth of the Russian River on July 17 It was catching fish by plunging into the river Two others were seen a mile above Monte Rio on July 22 One nest was noted on the very tall stump of a broken redwood near Rio Campo Bird students will doubt less be glad to know that this interesting bird is still breeding on the Russian River Agelaius phoeniceus caurinus Northwestern Redwinged Blackbird The Red winged Blackbirds of the lower Russian River seem to me to be of this subspecies rather than Agelaius phoeniceus californicus No specimens were taken but it is my opinion that an examination of specimens would reveal that what I have suggested is true Junco oreganus thurberi Sierra Junco Birds of this species were seen feeding young at Camp Meeker on July 2 They have been noted at Cazadero before but this seems to be the first time they have been found breeding as far south in Sonoma County as Camp Meeker Piranga ludoviciana Western Tanager An adult male was seen on the Russian River about a mile above Duncans Mills July 10 Hylocichla guttata slevini Monterey Hermit Thrush Noted twice at Camp Meeker and heard almost every evening in the redwood cations back of the campW A SQUInEs San Francisco California Notes on the Darkbodied ShearwaterPuffinus griseus has been observed on San Francisco Bay more frequently during July and August of the present year than it has ever before been my good fortune to record recent observations having been as follows July 20 440 P M A small movement was noted westerly from Alcatraz Island where the birds were working their way oceanwards along the outer edge of an extremely heavy channel fog July 21 435 P Mi A similar movement was observed under like conditions in about the same locality July 22 817 A M A small group of these birds was seen again in the same local ity bobbing up and down on the choppy water As the ferry boat approached they lum beringly took to wing passing directly across our bow some dropping on the water but a few feet away This afforded such a close view as to confirm the identification August 7 715 A Mi A lone individual was seen settled on the water and in the same locality The last two records were made on beautifully clear days thus casting doubt upon the theory that San Francisco Bay occurrences are due to misdirected wanderings during exceptionally thick fogs It now seems more probable that unusually heavy runs of fish bring us these casual visitorsJoHN W MAILLIARD San Francisco CaliforniaNov 1916 FROM FIELD AND STUDY 233 Snakes as Nest RobbersDuring the spring and summer of 1916 while collecting near Colton California we had the unpleasant experience of returning to many nests which had a few days before contained incomplete sets or been ready for eggs only to find them empty Suspicion was not directed towards the birds themselves because of the great variety of species in which this occurred nor could it be directed towards jays for none were present within several miles Cats weasels skunks and foxes were to be eliminated for in no case was a nest found to be in the least ruffled or disturbed the eggs having been extracted as deftly as we could have done ourselves perhaps more so Lack of any snakes in evidence and the large numbers of nests thus violated prevented a charge being made at the time against them It almost seemed as if some other collec tor was dogging our steps and getting our booty One day however as a nest of a Least Vireo which was due to have a full set was approached a great twittering crying and chattering from the parent birds was heard As the nest came into view the cause of the disturbance also appeared It consisted of a nice slim brown and white snake nicely poised above the nest which was now quite empty It can not be said with certainty but it appeared that some of the egg was still upon his chin On the same day attention was called to a nest of the Blackchinned Sparrow by the cries of the bird and examination disclosed a thin striped snake with his head actually inside the cup of the nest The nest was empty and the snake was evidently looking for more Another instance which came to our notice but was not observed by us showed the collecting proclivities of the snake In this case a nest of the Pacific Blackheaded Gros beak which was placed seven feet from the ground in a small sycamore tree was robbed by a gopher snake The robbery was witnessed by a boy and reported to us The snakes concerned in these three instances were of different species A Milk or King Snake Lampropeltis boylii got the vireo eggs a Garter Snake Thamnophis ham nmondl got the sparrow eggs a Gopher Snake Pituophis catenifer got the grosbeak eggs From the large number of robbed nests which came to our notice it would appear that snakes probably nearly all varieties present depend in part during the nesting sea son on eggs and possibly small young for food Nearly all the nests so robbed were placed in low bushes and were easily reached by snakes The fact that a bird will raise a hue and cry as a snake itself unaware approaches the nest probably leads the snake to look for the cause of the anxiety on the part of the bird and the nest is found It seems to me improbable that a snake can find a nest without being directed by the bird Now while a snake has a perfectly good right to hunt his prey it seems too bad that they cut into our field At the same time it does not seem justifiable to kill at sight each and every snake much better take off the hat to him and then chase him well into the next county where he will do the most goodJ R PEMBERTON and H W CARRIGER Colton California Spotted Owl from the San Gabriel Canyon Los Angeles County CaliforniaWhile troutfishing near Cold Brook Camp in the north fork of the West Fork of the San Ga briel Canyon Los Angeles County on May 1 1916 I took a beautiful adult male Spotted Owl Strix occidentalis occidentalis The bird was sitting about fifty feet up in a large oak tree in a narrow rather densely shaded canyon at an elevation of nearly four thousand feet The summer of 1914 I spent two months at Cold Brook but did not meet with any of these owls although large owls perhaps of this species were reported to me several timesWVRIGHT M PIERCE Claremont California

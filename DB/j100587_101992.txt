Excellent Author of this Synopsis of Quadrupeds and Serpents continues to oblige the World with fresh and frequent Specimens not only of his great Penetration in dis covering but of his particular Sagacity in ranging and digest ing the vast Body of Nature in most proper Clasies and Orders whereby the Memory is extreamly assisted and the Beauty of S s the850 the Creation illustrated Of this the Worthy Author has already been pleasd to publish very conspicuous Proofs in the Histories of Plants Birds Fishes and perhaps may do more in Insects The Design of this present Work intended for a Manual or PocketBook is to reduce all Quadrupeds into the most proper and natural Method for the more easie Comprehensi on and Memory of them and to add to the several Species such short Characterick Notes as whereby they may be cer tainly known and distinguished from others of the same kind First of all there is proposed the most exact division of all Animals in general which is first into Sanguineous and Exan guious Under the Exanguious or such as want that red Li quor we call Blood are comprehended 1 All crustaceous Fishes Crabs Lobsters  2 All Testaceous or Shell Fishes as Cockles Muscles Oysters Scallops Periwinkles Whilks c as also all Land ShellSnails 3 Those they call Mollia or Softfishes as Pulps Cuttlefishes naked Snails c 4 Insects of all sorts The Sanguineous kind are divided into such as breath by Lungs and such as breath by Gills of which kind are all San guineous Fishes except the Whalekind Such as breath by Lungs are divided into those that have but one Ventricle in the Heart and such as have two Ventricles Of the former kind are those they call Oviparous Quadrupeds and Serpents Thelatter are again subdivided into Viviparous or such as bring forth living Young and Oviparous or such as lay Eggs which are Birds or feathered Foul Lastly The Viviparous are divided into Aquatic or the Whale kind and Terrestrial under which the Author comprehends the Amphibious or Quadrupeds although all viviparous Animals of this kind are not Fourfooted there being one exception viz The Manati or Sea cow which hath but two Feet But all of them without exception are hairy and so may be distinguish ed from the Whalekind all of which have a smooth Skin Then follows a Division and Table of Viviparous Quadrupeds or Viviparous hairy Animals which are either hoofd or clawd The hoofd are either wholefooted or wholehoofd as the Horse and Ass or clovenfooted The Clovenhoofd are either Bisulc such as have the Hoof divided into two parts as the Ox Sheep and Goat or Quadrisulc which have the Hoof divi ded into four The former are either Ruminant such as chew the851 the Cud or NonRuminant viz The Hogkind The Ru minant are divided in respect of their Horns of which there are three Kinds 1 The Beefkind which have four Teats 2 The Sheepkind which bear Wool have but two Teats and wreathed Horns 3 The Goatkind which have streighter Horns and are covered with Hair instead of Wool and such as have solid branched and deciduous Horns as the Deerkind The Clawd have the Foot divided either into two Claws viz the Camelkind or into more called therefore Multifidous The Multifidous are divided into such as have broad Nails and a humane Shape as Apes and Monkeys and such as have narrower and pointed Nails These latter in respect of their Teeth are divided into such as have many fore Teeth or Cutters in each Jaw and such as have but two all which last are Herbivorous or Phytivorous Ani mals and from the most known Creature of this Tribe called the Harekind Those that have more fore Teeth or Cutters are distinguished into greater which have either a shorter Snout and round or square Head or a longer Snout and Head These from their likeness to the most known Animals of each kind the Cat and the Dog we call the former the Catkind and the latter the Dogkind To the Catkind belong the Lion Tyger Leo pard Ounce c to the Dogkind belong the Wolf Fox Badger Otter c and lesser which from their long slender Bodies like to the Weasel we call the Vermineous or Weezelkind To the Catkind are referred some anomalous Animals viz The Bat and the American Creature called Ai or Sloth To the Dogkind from their having a longer Snout are referred The Urchin or Hedgebog the Tatou or Armadillo the Mole the Shrewmouse or Erd ie Earthshrew the Tamandua or Ant bear which hath no Teeth at all Then are briefly described the several Species of all these kinds in order and to some of them large Anatomical De scriptions and Observations added As first of the Uterus of a pregnant Sow wherein the Adhaesion of the Chorion to the Uterus round about is shown and notice taken 1 Of the two large diaphanous Bladders one at each end of the Tunica Allantoides into which is a Passage out of the Allantoides so that the Liquor contained therein may easily be impelled into the Bladders and out of theBladders back again into the Allan S s 2 toides852 toides 2 Of the great quantity of Water contained in the Allantoides more by far then the Urine of so small an Animal in so short a time can likely amount to and inquiry made in to the Original and Use of it Its likely part of it may be separated from the Blood and excerned into the Cavity of the Tunicles by certain little Glanduleswhich the Author observed disseminated all over the Chorion The Tubae uterinae or Fallo pianae in this Creature are deseribed and shewn to be when extended at least 9 Inches long They do manifestly perfo rate the Cornua uteri so that a Style or Probe may easily be thrust either upward out of the Uterus into the Tubae or downward out of the Tubae into the Cornua uteri without re sistance or the impediment of any Valve Secondly Dr Tysons Description of the Tajacu or American Muskbog recorded in the Philosophical Transactions Numb 153 is inserted at large wherein are many curious Remarks which I shall not mention because I suppose they are well known having been so lately published in these Papers Thirdly An Anatomical Description of the Elephant by the Learned and Ingenious Dr Moulins which also having by the Author been published in English I shall for the Reason fore mentioned forbear to set down Particulars Fourthly Excerpta out of the Description of the Ape set forth by Parisian Academists wherein the Differences between the internal and external Parts of the Ape and Man are ob served and noted It is especially remarked that though the Muscles of the Os hyoides or Tonguebone the Tongue the Larynx and Pharynx which especially serve for the Articulation of the Voice be in Apes altogether like to those of a Man at least much more than the Muscles of the Hands which the Ape uses almost as perfectly as Man himself to all purposes yet is the Ape deprived of Speech Whence it is clear that Speech is an Action peculiar to Mankind by which he is more distin guished from Brutes than by the use of the Hand neither doth it necessarily follow that natural Agents do perform such and such Actions because they are furnished with Organs proper for the Performance of them Lastly853 Lastly Such Sanguineous Creatures as breath by Lungs and have but one Ventricle in their Hearts are enumerated and de scribed They are of four kinds 1 Frogs 2 Tortoises 3 Li zards 4 Serpents Concerning each of which there are cu rious Anatomical Observations added But especially a large Description of the outward and inward parts of the Rattlesnake composed by the forementioned Learned Person Dr Tyson and published in these Transactions Numb 144 the Particu lars whereof I shall therefore omit Before this Synopsis are premised some Discourses concern ing Animals in general As First Whether they are meer Machines or have any Sence and Perception that is whether they reflect upon and are conscious of what they do or suffer The Affirmative whereof seems most probable to the Author Secondly Concerning the Generation of Animals there are Three Questions discussed 1 Whether there be any Spon taneous or Equivocal Generation The Authors Opinion is That there is no such thing but that all Animals even the vilest Insects are generated by Animal Parents of their own kind 2 Whether all Individuals of every Species of Ani mals that ever were or shall be were at first created by God or whether there are every day new ones produced by Gene ration The Author is inclinable to their Opinion that hold all were at first created but not confident of it Seeing nei ther Man nor any other Creature is capable of forming such an Engine as an Animal Body and since all Females have in them from their first Formation the Seeds of all the Indivi duals they shall during their whole Life bring forth it is clear they have no power of producing new ones and a strong Presumption that all that have been or shall be were at first created 3 Whether the Seeds of Animals or rather the primordial Animalcules are lodged in the Egg of the Fe male or in the Sperm of the Male The Author is of the former Opinion for many Reasons which may be seen in the Book Thirdly854 Thirdly The Distinction of Animals into Viviparous and O viparous is considered and it is shewn that if the Word Vi viparous signifies according to the Etymology of it such as bring forth live Young then Animals of the same Genus may be some Viviparous and some Oviparous So for Example Some Serpents as the Adder are Viviparous and some as the common Snake Oviparous But if the Word Viviparous signifies such Animals as continually afford Nourishment to the Faetus during gestation from the Womb it self And Oviparous such as either lay Eggs or produce perfect Eggs that is such as contain all the Nourishment of the Faetus till it be excluded though they retain such Eggs in the Womb till exclusion af fording them only warmth and harbour then the distincti on may be of good use and as well such Serpents and Li zards as hatch their Eggs in their own Bodies as those that lay them in a Dunghil or other warm place to be cherish ed and hatchd by the Heat of the Sun may be called Ovi parous For the more easie and clear Comprehension and Distincti on of the several Kinds of Animals Mr Ray gives two Schemes or Tables of them The first a General one of all Animals the second a Particular one of Quadrupeds Animals855 Animals are either Sanguineous that is such as have Blood which breath either by Lungs  having either Two Ventricles in their Hearts  and those either Viviparous Aquatic as the Whalekind Terrestrial as Quadrupeds or in general all hairy Animals Oviparous as Birds which have immoveable and perforated Lungs But one Ventricle in their Hearts as Frogs Tortoises Serpents Gills as all Sanguineous Fishes except the Whale kind Exanguious or without Blood which may be divided into The Greater either Naked Terrestrial as Naked Snails Aquatic as the Poulp or Pourcontrel Polypus the Cuttlefish Sepia The Sleave or Inkfish Lolligo Covered with a Tegument either Crust aceous as Lobsters and Crabfish Test aceous whether Univalve as Limpets or Bivalve as Oysters Muscles Cockles or turbinate as Peri winkles Snails c The lesser as Insects of all sorts  Gills and Lungs differ in that Gills are but as it were invert ed Lungs The Air being drawn inwardly into the Lungs whereas it only outwardly touches or slides by the Gills   Animals that have two Ventricles in their Hearts use a frequent and constant inspiration and exspiration taking in and breathing out the AirBut those that have but one Ventricle use no such frequent inspiration and exspiration but receive in and retain the Air a considerable time in their Lungs before they breath it out again856 A T A B L E of Viviparous hairy Animals or Quadrupeds Viviparous Quadrupeds or Viviparous hairy Animals are either Hoofd which are either Wholefooted or hoofd as the Horse and Ass Clovenfooted having the Hoof divided into Two principal parts called Bisulca either Such as chew not the Cud as all sorts of Swine Ruminant or such as chew the Cud divided into Such as have perpetual and hollow Horns of which there are three Kinds viz 1 The Beefkind 2 The Sheepkind 3 The Goatkind Such as have solid branched and deciduous Horns as the Deerkind Four parts which we call Quadrisulca as the Rhinocerot and Hippopotamus Clawed or Digitata having the Foot divided into Two parts or Toes having two Nails as the Camelkind Many Toes or Claws either Undivided sticking all together covered with a common Skin the tips of the Toes only peeping out or appearing outwardly and being covered with Nails as the Elephant Divided from each other a good way down which have either Broad Nails and an Humane Shape as Apes and Monkeys Narrower and more pointed Nails in which in respect of their Teeth are divided into such as have Many fore Teeth or Cutters in each Jaw either The greater which have A shorter Snout and rounder Head which we call the Cat kind A longer Snout and Head which we call the Dogkind The lesser with a long slender Body and shorter Legswhich we call the Vermine or Weezelkind Only two large and remarkable fore Teeth all which are Phytivo rous These we call the Harekind For all which and the many subordinate Species under each Genus together with short Histories of them the Book it self must be consulted L O N D O N Printed for S Smith and B Walford Printers to the Royal Society at the

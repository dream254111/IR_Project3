GREAT ANTERIOR FEINS IN MAN AND MAMMALIA INCLUDING AN ACCOUNT OF CERTAIN REMNANTS OF FCETAL STRUCTURE FOUND IN THE ADULT A COMPARATIVE VIEW OF THESE GREAT VEINS IN THE DIFFERENT MAMMALIA AND AN ANALYSIS OF THEIR OCCASIONAL PECULIARITIES IN THE HUMAN SUBJECT BY JOHN MARSHALL FR CS LATE DEMONSTRATOR OF ANATOMY IN UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LON DON ASSISTANT SURGEON TO THE UNIVERSITY COLLEGE HOSPITAL COMMUNICATED BY PROFESSOR SHARPEY FRS RECEIVED JUNE 19READ JUNE 21 1849 THE PRINCIPAL OBJECT OF THE PRESENT PAPER IS TO STATE THE RESULT OF OBSERVATIONS ON THE METAMORPHOSIS OF CERTAIN OF THE GREAT VEINS IN MAN AND MAMMALIA AND ON THE RELATION BETWEEN THE PRIMITIVE AND FINAL CONDITION OF THESE VESSELS BOTH WHEN THEY PASS THROUGH THEIR CHANGES IN THE USUAL ORDER AND IN CASES OF DEVIATION FROM IT IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT IN THE MAMMALIAN EMBRYO THE GREAT VEINS ENTERING THE HEART FROM THE UPPER OR ANTERIOR PART OF THE BODY ARE ORIGINALLY SYMMETRICAL ON THE TWO SIDES AND THAT IN MAN THE QUADRUMANA AND MOST OF THE HIGHER ORDERS OF QUADRA PEDS THE VENOUS TRUNK OF THE LEFT SIDE UNDERGOES OCCLUSION WHILST IN OTHER MAIM MALIA THAT VESSEL CONTINUES AND CONSTITUTES IN THE ADULT STATE A LEFT VENA CAVA AN TERIOR WHICH PASSES DOWN IN FRONT OF THE LEFT LUNG AND THEN ALONG THE BACK OF THE HEART IN THE AURICULOVENTRICULAR GROOVE TO TERMINATE IN THE RIGHT AURICLE CERTAIN POINTS OF ANALOGY BETWEEN THESE DIFFERENT CONDITIONS ARE SUGGESTED BY A CAREFUL EXA MINATION OF THE GREAT VEINS IN ADULT HEARTS MORE ESPECIALLY OF WHAT IS USUALLY REGARDED IN THE HUMAN SUBJECT AS THE DILATED TERMINATION OF THE GREAT CORONARY VEIN IN THE RIGHT AURICLE THIS PORTION OF THE VESSEL PLATE I FIG 1 S WHICH HAS MUSCULAR PARIETES IS ON ACCOUNT OF ITS WIDTH USUALLY NAMED THE CORONARY SINUS ITS LENGTH MAY BE CONSIDERED AS DEFINED BY A VALVE X PLACED ABOUT AN INCH OR MORE FROM ITS OPENING INTO THE RIGHT AURICLE THIS VALVE WHICH WAS KNOWN TO VIEUSSENS HAS BEEN AGAIN RECENTLY POINTED OUT BY DR JOHN REIDT AND IS DESCRIBED BY HIM AS GENERALLY EXISTING AND FORMED OF ONE OR TWO SEGMENTS IN ALL THE EXAMINATIONS WHICH I HAVE MADE I HAVE FOUND IT PRESENT AND ALWAYS CONSISTING OF TWO SEGMENTS A LARGER ONE PLACED ON THE SIDE OF THE AURICULOVENTRICULAR FURROW AND A SMALLER ONE SITUATED ON THE FREE SIDE OF THE VEIN AND THEREFORE LIABLE TO BE DIVIDED IN SLITTING UP  TRAITE DE LA STRUCTURE C DU CCEUR TOULOUSE 1715 P 56 T CYC ANAT AND PHYS ART HEART P 597134 MR MARSHALL ON THE DEVELOPMENT THAT VESSEL SEE PLATE I INTO THE EXTREMITY OF THE CORONARY SINUS AS THUS DEFINED THE GREAT CORONARY VEIN G MAY BE SAID TO OPEN ITS ENTRANCE BEING GUARDED BY THE VALVE ALLUDED TO AND ALONG THE LOWER BORDER OF THE SINUS THERE ENTER THREE OR FOUR VENOUS BRANCHES P P P WHICH ASCEND FROM THE BACK OF THE VENTRICLES ONE OF THEM GENERALLY FORMING THE MIDDLE CARDIAC VEIN M THE MOUTHS OF THESE BRANCHES ARE ALSO ALMOST INVARIABLY PROVIDED WITH FINE VALVES CONSISTING OF ONE OR TWO SEGMENTS BUT BEYOND THE CORONARY SINUS AND THE LARGER VALVE FIRST NOTICED NO MORE VALVES ARE MET WITH EITHER IN THE TRUNK OF THE PRINCIPAL CARDIAC OR CORONARY VEIN OR IN ANY OF ITS TRIBUTARY BRANCHES IN THE HEARTS OF THE MONKEY CAT AND DOG A PRECISELY SIMILAR ARRANGEMENT IS OB SERVED IN THOSE ANIMALS WHICH POSSESS A LEFT VENA CAVA SUPERIOR THE GREAT CARDIAC OR CORONARY VEIN ENDS IN THAT ADDITIONAL VENOUS TRNNK AS SEEN FOR EXAMPLE IN THE MAR SUPIALIA MANY OF THE RODENTIA AND IN THE ELEPHANT MOREOVER IN CERTAIN RUMINANT AND OTHER ANIMALS AS FOR EXAMPLE THE SHEEP PLATE 1 FIG 2 IN WHICH A LARGE LEFT AZYGOS VEIN EXISTS ARCHING OVER THE ROOT OF THE LEFT LUNG AND THENCE PURSUING THE SAME COURSE TO THE RIGHT AURICLE AS THE LEFT VENA CAVA SUPERIOR IN THE CASES ALREADY ALLUDED TO THE CORONARY VEIN G OPENS INTO THIS AZYGOS VENOUS TRUNK SS IN BOTH THESE TWO CONDITIONS AS I HAVE OBSERVED IN THE RABBIT HEDGEHOG OX SHEEP AND PIG THE LOWER PART OF THE LARGE LEFT VENOUS TRUNK IS ALWAYS DILATED AND MUSCULAR AND AT THE OPENING OF THE CORONARY VEIN INTO IT THERE IS FOUND A LARGE VALVE COMPOSED IN SOME CASES OF ONE SEGMENT X AND IN OTHERS OF TWO A SERIES OF SMALL VEINS PMP ASCENDING FROM THE BACK OF THE HEART JOIN IT AT INTERVALS BETWEEN THE VALVED ENTRANCE OF THE CORONARY VEIN AND THE OPENING OF THE VENOUS TRUNK ITSELF INTO THE RIGHT AURICLE AND LASTLY THE MOUTHS OF THESE ASCENDING CARDIAC VEINS ARE FOR THE MOST PART REGULARLY PROVIDED WITH VALVES WHILST ON THE CONTRARY NO VALVES EXIST ALONG THE CONTINUATION UPWARDS OF THE LARGE VENOUS TRUNK AT LEAST IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE HEART NOR ARE VALVES MET WITH AS A CONSTANT CONDITION IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE CARDIAC VEINS THEMSELVES ON COMPARING IN MAN AND ANIMALS THE ARRANGEMENT OF THESE VESSELS AND THE DIS POSITION OF THEIR VALVES I NWAS LED TO CONJECTURE THAT THE DILATED AND SOMEWHAT MUSCULAR PORTION OF THE CORONARY VEIN USUALLY NAMED THE CORONARY SINUS PLATE I FIG 1 S TOGETHER WITH ITS LARGE AND IMPORTANT OPENING T INTO THE RIGHT AURICLE AS SEEN IN MAN AND SUCH OF THE HIGHER MAMMALIA AS HAVE NO LEFT VENA CAVA SUPERIOR OR LEFT AZYGOS VEIN WAS STRICTLY ANALOGOUS TO THE EXPANDED LOWER PORTION FIG 2 S AND AURICULAR ORIFICE T OF THOSE ADDITIONAL LEFT VENOUS TRUNKS AS FOUND IN OTHER QUADRUPEDS AND IN FACT THAT IT WAS THE PERSISTENT LOWER PART OF THE LEFT ANTERIOR PRIMITIVE VENOUS TRUNK ON THIS SUPPOSITION THE CORONARY VEIN PROPER IN MAN AND THE HIGHER MAMNINALIA MIGHT BE SAID TO END IN THE SOCALLED CORONARY SINUS AT THE VALVED ORIFICE ABOVE DE SCRIBED AND THUS ITS MODE OF TERMINATION INSTEAD OF VARYING IN DIFFERENT CASES WOULD BE SIMILAR THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE MNAMMALIAN SERIESTHE VESSEL IN NO CASE REACHINGOF THE GREAT ANTERIOR VEINS 135 THE RIGHT AURICLE DIRECTLY BUT ALWAYS POURING ITS BLOOD LIKE THE POSTERIOR CARDIAC VEINS GENERALLY INTO A LARGER VENOUS TRUNK THE ANALOGY THUS INDICATED BETWEEN THE CORONARY SINUS ON THE ONE HAND AND THE LOWER PORTION OF THE LEFT VENA CAVA SUPERIOR OR LEFT VENA AZYGOS ON THE OTHER IS AP PARENT NOT ONLY IN THEIR LIKENESS AS TO SHAPE AND STRUCTURE AND THE DISPOSITION OF THEIR BRANCHES AND VALVES BUT ALSO IN THE SIMILARITY OF THEIR SITUATION DIRECTION AND CON NECTIONS WITH THE HEART AND IN THE RESEMBLANCE NOT ALTOGETHER OVERLOOKED BY ANATO MISTS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OPENINGS INTO THE RIGHT AURICLE ACCORDING TO RATHKE HOWEVER WHOSE AUTHORITY IS GENERALLY FOLLOWED THE LEFT AN TERIOR PRIMITIVE VENOUS TRUNK IN THE HUMAN SUBJECT CLOSES AND ENTIRELY DISAPPEARS IN THE PROGRESS OF DEVELOPMENT FROM THE ROOT OF THE NECK DOWN TO THE HEART BUT IF ON THE CONTRARY THE CORONARY SINUS AS FOUND IN THE ADULT CONDITION IN MAN AND SOME OF THE HIGHER MAMMALIA BE AS IS ABOVE SUGGESTED THE ANALOGUE OF OR TO EXPRESS THE FACT IN ANOTHER FORM BE THE LOWER PERVIOUS PORTION OF THE LEFT PRIMITIVE REIN MIGHT IT NOT POSSIBLY HAPPEN THAT EVEN ON THE FULLYFORMED HEART SOME REMNANT OF ITS UPPER OCCLUDED PORTION SHOULD STILL EXIST ABOVE THE VALVED ENTRANCE OF THE CORONARY VEIN INTO THE CORONARY SINUS SEARCHING ACCORDINGLY IN THE ADULT HUMAN HEART I HAVE FOUND IN UPWARDS OF TWENTY DIFFERENT INSTANCES CERTAIN PARTS OR STRUCTURES PLATE I FIG 1 O 1 V ALWAYS CLEARLY DISTINGUISHABLE THOUGH VARYING IN DISTINCTNESS WHICH FROM THEIR POSITION AND GENERAL CHARACTER ARE UNDOUBTED REMAINS OF THE UPPER PORTION OF THE LEFT PRIMITIVE VENOUS TRUNK ANALOGOUS REMNANTS OF THE LEFT PRIMITIVE VEIN ARE ALSO TO BE SEEN IN ALL THOSE MAMN MALIA IN WHICHAS IN THE DOG THE CAT AND THE MONKEYTHE SAME AMOUNT OF OC CLUSION OF THAT VESSEL OCCURS AS IN THE HUMAN SUBJECT AND A COMPARATIVE EXAMINA TION OF THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE VEINS IN DIFFERENT ANIMALS OF THE VARIOUS INSTANCES OF DEVIATION FROM THE ORDINARY CONDITION IN MAN AND OF THE METAMORPHOSIS OF THESE VESSELS IN HUMAN AND OTHER EMBRYOS HAS SUFFICED TO ESTABLISH BEYOND A DOUBT THE IDENTITY OF THE PARTS UNDER CONSIDERATION THE RESULTS OF THE ENTIRE INVESTIGATION TOGETHER WITH DUE REFERENCE TO THE LABOURS OF OTHERS MAY BE CONVENIENTLY PRESENTED UNDER THE FOLLOWING HEADS 1 DEVELOPMENT OF THE GREAT ANTERIOR VEINS 2 COMPARATIVE VIEW OF THE ADULT CONDITION OF THESE VEINS IN MAN AND MAMMALIA 3 ANALYSIS OF THEIR VARIETIES IN THE HUMAN SUBJECT  IN THE THIRTEENTH OBSERVATION OUT OF TWENTYFOUR I FORTUNATELY MET WITH AN EXAMPLE OF DOUBLE VENA CAVA SUPERIOR IN THE ADULT A RARE AND INTERESTING VARIETY IN RELATION TO THE PRESENT SUBJECT SINCE THEN I HAVE HAD PRESENTED TO ME A SECOND EXAMPLE OCCURRING IN A CHILD BETWEEN FOUR AND FIVE YEARS OLD I MAY TAKE THE PRE SENT OPPORTUNITY OF THANKING DR SHARPEY MR STREETER AND MR W BENNETT FOR AID IN PROCURING MATERIALS FOR THIS INVESTIGATION136 MR MARSHALL ON THE DEVELOPMENT I DEVELOPMENT OF THE GREAT ANTERIOR VEINS IT HAS BEEN SHOWN BY RATHKE TO WHOM WE ARE CHIEFLY INDEBTED FOR OUR KNOW LEDGE OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE VEINS THAT IN MAN AND MAMMALIA AS IN THE VERTE BRATA GENERALLY THE BLOOD OF NEARLY ALL PARTS OF THE EMBRYO IS RETURNED TO THE HEART LY TWO PAIRS OF VENOUS TRUNKS VIZ AN ANTERIOR AND A POSTERIOR PAIR PLACED SYMME TRICALLY IN THE LATERAL HALVES OF THE BODY BESIDES THESE HOWEVER THERE IS A MEDIAN INFERIOR VENOUS TRUNK WHICH FORMS IN SUCCESSION THE TERMINATION OF THE OMPHALO MESENTERIC AND UMBILICAL VEINS AND FINALLY BECOMES THE VENA CAVA INFERIOR OF THE FOUR LATERAL VEINS THE ANTERIOR PAIR FORMED BY BRANCHES FROM THE HEAD AND NECK CONSTITUTE THE JUGULAR VEINS THE POSTERIOR PAIR WHICH RETURN THE BLOOD FROM THE WOLFFIAN BODIES AND THE HINDER PART OF THE EMBRYO ARE CALLED THE CARDINAL VEINS THE CARDINAL AND THE JUGULAR VEIN OF EACH SIDE JOIN TO FORM A SHORT WIDE VESSEL NAMED THE CANAL OF CUVIER AND AGAIN THE TWO CANALS OF CUVIER SO NAMED FROM THEIR RESEMBLANCE TO THE DUCTUS CUVIERI IN FISHES RUNNING DOWNWARDS AND FORWARDS AT THE SIDES OF THE CESOPHAGUS UNITE IN FRONT OF THAT TUBE INTO A COMMON TRUNK WHICH IMMEDIATELY ENTERS THE YET UNDIVIDED AURICULAR PORTION OF THE HEART IN THE SUBSE QUENT ENLARGEMENT OF THE YET SINGLE AURICLE THIS COMMON TRUNK COMES AS IT WERE TO FORM PART OF THAT CAVITY INTO WHICH ACCORDINGLY THE TWO CANALS OF CUVIER HENCEFORTH OPEN SEPARATELY AND THUS REPRESENT TWO SUPERIOR VENVE CAVVE ONE ON EACH SIDE WHEN THE WOLFFIAN BODIES DISAPPEAR THE CARDINAL VEINS DIMINISH IN SIZE RETURNING THE BLOOD FROM THE HINDER LIMBS AND TRUNK OF THE EMBRYO ONLY IN THE MEAN TIME THE INTERCOSTAL VEINS ARE FORMED AND UNITED TOGETHER BY VERTICAL ANASTOMOSES ON EACH SIDE SO AS TO FORM THE AZYGOS AND HERNIAZYGOS VEINS FINALLY IN MAN THE LEFT CARDINAL VEIN BECOMES ACCORDING TO RATHKE ENTIRELY OBLITERATED WHILST THE UPPER PORTION OF THE VEIN OF THE RIGHT SIDE IS PROBABLY CONCERNED IN THE FORMATION OF THE TERMINATION OF THE AZYGOS VEIN IN THE MEANTIME A TRANSVERSE CONNECTING BRANCH IS DEVELOPED ACROSS THE LOWER PART OF THE NECK BETWEEN THE TWO JUGULAR VEINS THIS TRANSVERSE BRANCH IS RAPIDLY ENLARGED AND THEN IN THE HUMAN EMBRYO AND ALSO IN THOSE ANIMALS WHICH HAVE NO LERMANENT VENOUS TRUNK ON THE LEFT SIDE THAT PORTION OF THE ORIGINAL LEFT JUGULAR TRUNK WHICH IS SITUATED LOWER DOWN THAN THE TRANSVERSE BRANCH OR NEARER TO THE HEART AND ALSO THE LEFT CANAL OF CUVIER WHICH IS CONTINUOUS WITH IT SHRINK AND DISAPPEAR THE ENLARGING TRANSVERSE BRANCH ACROSS THE NECK FORMS THE LEFT INNOMINATE VEIN AND THE LOWER PART OF THE RIGHT JUGULAR WITH ITS CANAL OF CUVIER RECEIVING THE REMAINS OF THE RIGHT CARDINAL VEIN NOW THE TERMINAL PART OF THE VENA AZYGOS CONSTITUTES THE VENA CAVA SUPERIOR AS ORDINARILY MET WITH THUS THE METAMORPHOSIS IS COMPLETE IN THE SHEEP HOWEVER IT WAS OBSERVED BY RATHKE THAT THE UPPER PART OF THE LEFT  RATHKE  UEBER DIE FRIIHESTE FORM UND DIE ENTWICKELUNG

PRESENT IN THAT ANIMNAL WHILST THAT PART OF THE LEFT PRIMITIVE VENOUS TRUNK WHICH IS SITUATED BETWEEN THE CANAL OF CUVIER AND THE JUNCTION OF THE LEFT SUBCLAVIAN AND JUGULAR VEINS DISAPPEARS AND ONLY A SUBORDINATE TWIG IS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND IN ITS PLACE WHICH ENDS IN A SMALL LEFT SUPERIOR INTERCOSTAL VEIN LASTLY IN THOSE ANIMALS WHICH IN THE ADULT CONDITION HAVE A RIGHT AND LEFT SUPERIOR VENA CAVA THE LEFT PRIMITIVE JUGULAR VEIN TOGETHER WITH THE CORRESPONDING CANAL OF CUVIER REMAINS PERVIOUS THROUGHOUT LIFE THIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE COMMON TYPE OF FORMATION OF THE VEINS IN THE VERTEBRATA AND OF THEIR METAMORPHOSIS IN CERTAIN SPECIES BY PARTIAL OCCLUSION SUGGESTED TO RATHKE THE EXPLANATION OF THE OCCASIONAL OCCURRENCE OF DOUBLE VENA CAVA SUPERIOR IN THE HUMAN SUBJECT AS THE RESULT OF AN ARREST OF DEVE LOPMENT NEVERTHELESS THE DETAILS OF THIS METAMORPHOSIS HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY INDI CATED NOR AS FAR AS I AM AWARE HAVE ANY PERSISTENT REMNANTS OF THE FOETAL STRUCTURE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN THE ADULT BY RATHIKE HIMSELF THE LEFT PRIMITIVE VEIN IS SAID IN MAN TO DIMINISH AND ENTIRELY DISAPPEAR FROM OPPOSITE THE LEFT END OF THE TRANSVERSE VEIN OF THE NECK DOWN TO THE HEART BUT THIS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN AN INFERENCE FROM THE KNOWN ADULT CONDITION AND I DO NOT KNOW THAT EITHER HE OR OTHERS HAVE GIVEN ANY DESCRIPTION OR DELINEATION OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE VEINS AS ACTUALLY TRACED IN THE HUMAN EMBRYO THE METAMORPHOSIS OF THE PRIMITIVE LATERAL AND SYMMETRICAL VENOUS TRUNKS IN THE HIGHER MAMMALIA AND IN MAN MAY BE SAID TO CONSIST OF TWO FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES VIZ A THE FORMATION OF THE CROSS BRANCH OR COMMUNICATION IN THE NECK AND B THE OCCLUSION OF A GREATER OR LESS PORTIOTN OF THE LEFT PRIMITIVE VENOUS TRUNK BESIDES THIS HOWEVER THERE ARE DURING EMBRYONIC LIFE C CERTAIN CONCURRENT AND SUBSEQUENT ALTERATIONS IN THE SIZE POSITION AND DIRECTION OF THE VENOUS TRUNKS WHICH FINALLY RE MAIN PERVIOUS LASTLY D THERE ARE THE CHANGES WHICH TAKE PLACE AFTER BIRTH DEVELOPMENT IN THE SHEEP A FORMATION OF THE TRANSVERSE COMMUNICATION IN THE NECK IN EMBRYOS MEASURING  THLS OF AN INCH WELLPRESERVED IN SPIRIT AND IN WHICH THE BLOOD WAS HARDENED IN THE VEINS NO APPEARANCE OF A CROSS BRANCH WAS DISCERNIBLE THE EARLIEST SATISFACTORY INDICATIONS OF ITS COMMENCEMENT WERE MET WITH IN EMBRYOS FROM LTHS TO 5THS OF AN INCH IN LENGTH IN THESE PLATE II FIGS 1 2 3 TWO LITTLE SPURSHAPED POINTS FILLED WITH HARDENED BLOOD PROJECTED TOWARDS EACH OTHER FROMN THE INNER BORDERS OF THE JUGULAR TRUNKS ASA IMMEDIATELY ABOVE THE COMMENCING PERI CARDIURN ON A LEVEL WITH THE SUBDIVISION OF THE ASCENDING AORTA IN SOLNE CASES NO INTERMEDIATE PORTION OF VEIN BETWEEN THESE POINTS COULD BE DETECTED BUT IN OTHERS THE CONNECTION WAS EVIDENTLY COMPLETED BY A MATERIAL MORE OPAKE THAN THAT AROUND WHICH COULD BE OFTEN RAISED AS AN INDISTINCT NARROW CORD CONTAINING HOWEVEM NO MDCCCL T138 MR MARSHALL ON THE DEVELOPMENT HARDENED BLOOD FIG 5 D EVEN IN EMBRYOS AS LONG AS 17THS OF AN INCH FIG 4 NO RED LINE COULD BE TRACED QUITE ACROSS THE NECK ALTHOUGH THE LATERAL PRIMITIVE VEINS WERE TURGID WITH BLOOD AND PRESENTED TWO CONICAL PROJECTIONS AT THE SITUATION OF THE CROSS BRANCH THIS CROSS BRANCH IS SUPPOSED TO BE FORMED BY THE ENLARGEMENT OF A PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED VESSEL OF ALMOST CAPILLARY DIMENSIONS PERHAPS ONE OF SEVERAL SUCH VESSELS PASSING ACROSS THE NECK BUT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IT MIGHT BE FORMED IN THE SAME WAY AS THE OTHER GREAT VESSELS THE APPEARANCES ABOVE DESCRIBED WOULD SUGGEST THE IDEA THAT THIS TRANSVERSE BRANCH WAS FORMED BY THE BUDDING OUT AND SUBSEQUENT JUNCTION OF TWO OPPOSITE POINTS OF THE OLDER VEINS BUT THIS APPEARANCE IS PROBABLY OWING MERELY TO THE VESSEL BEING SMALLER AND EMPTY OF BLOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF ITS COURSE OR TO ITS BEING ACCIDENTALLY BROKEN AT THAT POINT BUT STILL IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE EXTRE MITIES OF THE NEW TRANSVERSE VEIN IN CONNECTION WITH THE OLDER VESSELS ARE AT FIRST ALWAYS ENLARGED MORE THAN THE INTERMEDIATE PORTION IN RECENT EMBRYOS OF THE GUINEA PIG MEASURING ABOUT HALF AN INCH IN LENGTH I HAVE TWICE RECOGNIZED THE TRANSVERSE BRANCH AS A VERY MINUTE CONTINUOUS VESSEL PASSING QUITE ACROSS THE NECK BETWEEN THE TWO JUGULAR VEINS JUST ABOVE THE PERICARDIUM IN ONE VERY EARLY EMBRYO Y6OTHS OF AN INCH LONG A SMALL VESSEL EVIDENTLY A VEIN TRAVERSED THE NECK HIGHER UP SUPPORTED BY THE BRANCHIAL ARCH WHICH WAS BEING TRANSFORMED INTO THE LOWER JAW THE LOWER CROSS BRANCH WAS NOT YET FORMED IN THIS CASE DURING THE WIDENING OF THE CROSS BRANCH THE TWO JUGULAR TRUNKS AA AT THAT POINT GRADUALLY APPROACH EACH OTHERTHE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM ABSOLUTELY AS WELL AS RELATIVELY DECREASING COMPARE FIGS 2 AND 6 REPRESENTING EMBRYOS OF THS AND  THS OF AN INCH IN LENGTH INSTEAD OF DESCENDING PARALLEL WITH EACH OTHER THESE VEINS NOW INCLINE TO THE MIDDLE LINE OF THE NECK OPPOSITE THE CROSS BRANCH AND ASSISTED BY THE SHORTENING AND WIDENING OUT OF THAT VESSEL THEY APPEAR AT LENGTH TO COALESCE ALMOST BY LATERAL ADAPTATION BEFORE ANY DIMINUTION OF THE LEFT PRIMITIVE VEIN HAS BEGUN TO TAKE PLACE FIG 7 EMBRYO 1 INCH 2THS LONG IN LATER EMBRYOS FIG 8 1 INCH AND MTHS LONG FIG 10 11 INCH LONG IN WHICH THE NECK IS ALREADY BECOMING ELONGATED BY THE TIME THAT THE OCCLUSION OF THE LEFT PRIMITIVE VEIN IS ACCOMPLISHED THE TWO JUGULAR VEINS HAVING RECEIVED THE LARGE SUPER FICIAL VEINS OF THE NECK AND THOSE FROM THE ANTERIOR LIMBS ARE SO CLOSELY APPLIED TO EACH OTHER AND THEIR CONNECTING BRANCH IS BECOME SO ENTIRELY ABSORBED INTO THEM THAT THEY JOIN TOGETHER AT A VERY ACUTE ANGLE OR RATHER THE VEIN OF THE LEFT SIDE NOW THE LEFT INNOMINATE VEIN RUNS CONTINUOUSLY INTO THE LOWER PATT OF THE RIGHT PRIMITIVE VEIN OR SUPERIOR VENA CAVA WHILST THE RIGHT INNOMINATE VEIN APPEARS TO FALL INTO THIS LARGE CONTINUOUS TRUNK AT AN ACUTE ANGLE ATSTILL LATER PERIODS WHEN THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN PROJECTS PROMINENTLY FORWARD AT THE LOWER END OF THE SLENDER NECK IMMEDIATELY ABOVE THE NARROW APERTURE OF THE THORAX THIS OBLIQUITY OF THE JUNCTION BETWEEN THE INNOMINATE VEINS IS AS MARKED AS IN THE ADULT ANIMNALOF THE GREAT ANTERIOR VEINS 139 B OCCLUSION OF A PORTION OF THE LEFT PRIMITIVE VEIN BEFORE THE COMMENCEMENT OF THIS STAGE OF THE METAMORPHOSIS THE JUGULAR TRUNKS ARE CLOSELY APPROXIMATED AND OPEN FREELY INTO EACH OTHER BY MEANS OF THE WIDE AND VERY SHORT COMMUNICATING BRANCH FIG 7 D PREVIOUSLY TO THIS CHANGE ALSO THAT POR TION OF BOTH PRIMITIVE JUGULARS WHICH IS SITUATED BELOW THE CROSS BRANCH BECOMES ELONGATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GROWTH OF THE THORAX AND NOW INCLINING OUTWARDS DESCENDS THROUGH A MUCH LONGER COURSE UPON THE PERICARDIURN BENEATH THE PLEURA TO JOIN THE CARDINAL VEIN OF ITS OWN SIDE AND END IN THE CORRESPONDING CANAL OF CUVIER IT IS JUST THIS PORTION OF THE LEFT PRIMITIVE JUGULAR VEIN VIZ FROM THE TRANSVERSE BRANCH IN THE NECK TO THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE LEFT CANAL OF CUVIER WHICH BECOMES CLOSED IN THE SHEEP IN EMBRYOS MEASURING 1 INCH AND 1 LINE FIG 7 THE VESSEL AT HAS EITHER NOT BEGUN OR IS ONLY JUST BEGINNING TO SHRINK BUT SO RAPIDLY DOES THE PRO CESS TAKE PLACE THAT IN OTHERS SCARCELY 1 LINE LONGER FIG 8 THE VESSEL IS ALREADY CLOSED AND NOW APPEARS AS A SEMITRANSPARENT CORD O EXTENDING FROM THE POINT OF JUNCTION OF THE PRIMITIVE JUGULAR TRUNKS IN THE NECK TO THE ARCH FORMED BY THE LEFT CARDINAL VEIN B AND LEFT CANAL OF CUVIER C THIS CORD IS FINER AT ITS LOWER END IT LIES AT FIRST IN FRONT OF THE AORTA AND THEN PASSES DOWN CLOSE TO THE PERICARDIUMD ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE DUCTUS ARTERIOSUS IT IS IN CONTACT BELOW WITH THE LEFT PLEURA THE PAR VAGUM DESCENDS BEHIND IT AND IT IS CROSSED BY THE PHRENIC NERVE CLOSE BEHIND THE UPPER END OF THIS CORD BUT NOT ACTUALLY CONNECTED WITH IT A CONSIDERABLE VEIN FORMED BY THE LEFT VERTEBRAL AND A LARGE PERFORATING INTERCOSTAL FROM THE BACK JOINS THE UNDER SIDE OF THE LEFT INNOMINATE VEIN IN LATER EMBRYOS THE ABOVEMENTIONED CORD BECOMES LESS AND LESS DISTINCT IN AN EMBRYO MEASURING 12 INCH LONG FIG 10 IT CANNOT BE CONTINUOUSLY TRACED AND IN A FETAL SHEEP 4 INCHES IN LENGTH FROM THE VERTEX TO THE TAIL IT IS NOT PERCEPTIBLE IN ITS PLACE HOWEVER THERE IS FOUND A LONG RIDGE OR ELEVATION OF THE PERICARDIUM CONTAINING FIBROUS TISSUE WHICH MAY BE FOLLOWED FROM BELOW UPWARDS CLOSE TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE LARGE DUCTUS ARTERIOSUS IN A DIRECTION TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOT OF THE NECK ABOVE THE PERICARDIAL SAC THE TRACES OF IT ARE ALMOST ENTIRELY LOST C 0ONCURRENT AND SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN THE PERVIOUS VESSELS IN SIZE AS THE LEFT PRIMITIVE VEIN IS UNDERGOING OCCLUSION THE LOWER PART OF THE RIGHT JUGULAR VEIN FIGS 8 10 A AND THE RIGHT CANAL OF CUVIER SIMPLY ENLARGE AS RATHKE STATES TO FORM THE SUPERIOR VENA CAVA THE ADJOINING PART OF THE RIGHT CAR DINAL VEIN HAVING FIRST SHRUNK IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE WASTING OF THE WOLFFIAN BODY REMAINS FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME AS A RIGHT AZYGOS VEIN EQUALING IN SIZE THE LEFT AZYGOS BOUT ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF FECTAL LIFE IT IS SMALLER THAN THE VEIN ON THE LEFT SIDE AND AFTERWARDS ITS CONNECTION WITH THE RIGHT INTERCOSTAL VEINS BEING GRADUALLY CUT OFF IT SLOWLY DIMINISHES UNTIL IT EXISTS ONLY AS A VERY SMALL VESSEL OR SOMETIMES WHOLLY DISAPPEARS THE LEFT CARDINAL VEIN B ON THE CONTRARY FORMS AFTER THE DIS APPEARANCE OF THLE COR RESPONDING WOLFFIAN BODY A LEFT VENA AZYGOS WHICH THOUGH FOR T 2140 MR MARSHALL ON THE DEVELOPMENT A TIME OF THE SAME SIZE AS THE RIGHT AZYGOS AFTERWARDS SURPASSES IT IN CONSEQUENCE OF RECEIVING THE LOWER RIGHT INTERCOSTAL VEINS IN ADDITION TO ALMOST ALL THOSE OF ITS OWN SIDE THE LEFT CANAL OF CUVIER C REDUCED GREATLY IN WIDTH AFTER THE OCCLUSION OF THE PRIMITIVE JUGULAR VEIN CONSTITUTES THE INTRAPERICARDIAL PART OF THE LEFT AZYGOS VEIN AND WITH THE REST OF THAT VESSEL FORMS A VENOUS ARCH WHICH TURNS OVER THE ROOT OF THE LEFT LUNG AND IS CONNECTED ABOVE WITH THE CORDLIKE VESTIGE OF THE OCCLUDED VEIN O IN POSITION AND DIRECTION THE CARDINAL VEINS IN ORDER TO UNITE WITH THE JUGULAR VEINS IN THE CORRESPONDING CANALS OF CUVIER BEND FORWARDS ABOVE THE COMMENCING LUNGS FIGS 1 AND 24 4 FROM WHICH THEY ARE FOR A TIME SEPARATED BY THE UPPER END OF THE WOLFFIAN BODIES 5 5 THE RUDIMENTARY RIGHT LUNG BEING ALMOST FROM THE COMMENCEMENT LARGER AND SOMEWHAT HIGHER UP IN THE THORAX THAN THE LEFT THE RIGHT CARDINAL VEIN B EVEN AT A VERY EARLY PERIOD SEE FIGS 2 AND 9 REACHES HIGHER THAN THE VEIN OF THE LEFT SIDE   A PECULIARITY IN POSITION WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY INCREASES SO THAT IN A FOETUS OF 4 INCHES IN LENGTH THE ARCH OF THE RIGHT AZYGOS RISES THREE LINES HIGHER UP IN THE THORAX THAN THAT OF THE LEFT VEIN THE CARDINAL VEINS LIKE THE JUGULARS ARE ALTOGETHER OUTSIDE THE PERICARDIUN BUT AS SOON AS THAT SAC IS FORMED THE CANALS OF CUVIER ARE FOUND ALMOST ENTIRELY WITHIN IT AT FIRST FIGS 1 2 3 C C THESE CANALS PASS HORIZONTALLY FORWARDS AND INWARDS TO THE BACK OF THE AURICULAR PORTION OF THE HEART INTO WHICH THEY OPEN ON THE SAME LEVEL ONE ON EITHER SIDE IN FRONT OF THE INFERIOR CAVA BUT AS THE LUNGS ENLARGE AND OCCUPY NORE OF THE THORACIC CAVITY THE CUVIERIAN CANALS HAVE TO DESCEND MORE AND MORE OBLIQUELY IN FRONT OF THE ROOTS OF THOSE ORGANS TO REACH THE HEART FIGS 7 TO 10 IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE HIGHER POSITION OF THE ROOT OF THE RIGHT LUNG THIS CHANGE IN DIREC TION IS MORE MARKED IN THE RIGHT CANAL OF CUVIER OR FUTURE VENA CAVA SUPERIORL THE HEART ITSELF IN THE PROGRESS OF GROWTH BECOMES SLIGHTLY TWISTED ESPECIALLY AT ITS BASE OR AURICULAR PART ITS RIGHT BORDER BEING TURNED SOMEWHAT UPWARDS SUPPOSING THE THORAX TO LBE PLACED VERTICALLY FIG 9 EMBRYO 1 INCH AND 2 LINES LONG THE PARTS BEING SEEN FROM BEHIND HENCE THE ENLARGED RIGHT CANAL OF CUVIER C OR UPPER VENA CAVA REACHES THE FUTURE RIGHT AURICLE SOONER AND MORE DIRECTLY THAN THE SMALLER LEFT CANAL C OR LEFT AZYGOS VENOUS TRUNK THE FORMER HAVING A COMPARATIVELY SHORT AND ALMOST VERTICAL COURSE WHILST THE LATTER AFTER HAVING DESCENDED IN FRONT OF THLE ROOT OF THE LEFT LUNG HAS TO TURN BENEATH THE BASE OF THE HEART TO GAIN ITS DESTINED END IN THE RIGHT AURICLE AT THE SAME TIME THE POSITION OF THE OPENINGS OF THE META IORPHOSED CANALS OF CUVIER IN THE FUTURE RIGHT AURICLE UNDERGO A CHANGE FOR INSTEAD OF BOTH OF THEMN BEING PLACED AS AT FIRST ON THE SAME LEVEL ONE ON EACH SIDE OF THE INFERIOR CAVA THE ORIFICE OF THE RIGHT CANAL OR UPPER CAVA OPENS WIDELY INTO THE HIGHEST PART OF THE AURICLE NEARLY IN A LINE WITH THE LOWER CAVA E WHILST THE LEFT CANAL OR LEFT AZYGOS ENDS AT THE LOWER AND BACK PART OF THE AURICLE CLOSE TO THE COMMENCING SEPTUM THE SEROUS LAYER OF THE PERICARDIUM IS AT FIRST EQUALLY REFLECTED OVER BOTH THE CUVIERIAN CANALS BUT IN TIMNE WHILST IT COVERS ONLY A SMALLER AND SMALLER PART OF THE ANTERIOR SURFACE OF THE RIGHT CANAL OR UPPER CAVA IT FORMS A MORE ANLD MOREOF THE GREAT ANTERIOR VEINS 141 DISTINCTFOLD OR DUPLICATURE FIG 10 C IN WHICH THE LEFT CANAL OR LEFT AZYGOS TRUNK IS LODGED AS IT PASSES DOWN IN FRONT OF THE LEFT PULMONARY VESSELS TO REACH THE SIDE OF THE LEFT AURICLE IMMEDIATELY BEHIND THE APPENDIX BEYOND THAT POINT THE VEIN AS IT LIES ON THE BACK OF THE LEFT AURICLE AND RUNS ALONG THE AURICULOVENTRICULAR GROOVE TO REACH THE RIGHT AURICLE IS ALSO COVERED BY THE SEROUS LAYER OF THE PERICARDIUIN IN THE HEART OF A FEETUS 4 INCHES IN LENGTH SEVERAL SMALL VEINS FROM THE SUBSTANCE OF THE LEFT VENTRICLE MAY BE SEEN ENDING IN THE LOWER PART OF THE LEFT AZYGOS TRUNK AND AMONGST THEM ONE WHICH JOINS IT AT AN ACUTE ANGLE IS THE FUTURE CORONARY VEIN D CHANGES AT BIRTH WHEN AFTER BIRTH THE SHORT AND WIDE DUCTUS ARTERIOSUS SHRINKS THE LONG RIDGE OF THE PERICARDIUM WITH ITS CONTAINED FIBROUS TISSUE ALREADY DESCRIBED AS RESTING UPON THAT VESSEL IN THE POSITION OF THE OCCLUDED LEFT VEIN BECOMES CLOSELY APPLIED TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE AORTIC ARCH AND MAY BE TRACED IN THE DIRECTION OF A LINE IRAWN FROM THE POINT OF JUNCTION OF THE INNOMINATE VEINS AT THE ROOT OF THE NECK DOWN TO THE HIGHEST POINT OF THE ARCH OF THE LEFT AZYGOS VEIN WITHIN THE PERICARDIUM THE TRUNK OF THE LEFT AZYGOS OCCUPIES ITS PROPERFOLD OF THE SEROUS MEMBRANE AND RECEIVES SHORTLY BEFORE ITS TERMINATION IN THE RIGHT AURICLE AS SEEN IN PLATE I FIG 2 THE CORONARY VEIN OF THE HEART G AND TWO POSTERIOR CARDIAC BRANCHES P M BESIDES A THIRD SMALLER ONE P WHICH MIGHT ALMOST BE SAID TO END AT ONCE IN THE RIGHT AURICLE THE MOUTH T OF THIS LEFT AZYGOS VENOUS TRUNK IS SITUATED TO THE LEFT OF THE ORIFICE OF THE INFERIOR CAVA E CLOSE TO THE INTERAURICULAR SEPTUM AND BELOW AND BEHIND THE FOSSA OVALIS LIKE THAT OF THE LEFT SUPERIOR CAVA IN THE LOWER MAMNMALIA AND IN BIRDS IT HAS NO RRHEBESIAN VALVE WHICH IS REPRESENTED IN THE SHEEP MERELY BY A SLIGHT RIDGE OF THE AURICULAR PARIETES AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE CORONARY VEIN INTO THE LEFT AZYGOS THERE IS HOWEVER A LARGE DISTINCT VALVE X CONSISTING OF ONE STRONG SEGMENT THE TWO CARDIAC VEINS SUCCEEDING IT ARE EACH GUARDED BY FINER VALVES OF TWO SEGMENTS AND THE THIRD VEIN GENERALLY BY A SINGLE SEGMENT ALONG THE COURSE OF THE CORONARY VEIN THERE ARE FROM ONE TO FOUR OTHER VALVES CONSISTING USUALLY OF ONE SEGMENT BUT SOMETIMES OF TWO LASTLY THE RIGHT AZYGOS IS NOW A MUCH LESS IMPORTANT VEIN THAN THAT OF THE LEFT SIDE IT REACHES FROM 3 TO 5 INCHES HIGHER IN THE CHEST AND IS SO SMALL AS TO HAVE BEEN SAID BY SOME ANATOINISTS INCLUDING RATHKE TO BE ALWAYS WANTING OCCASIONALLY ONCE IN FIVE OBSERVATIONS IT WAS FOUND TO BE SO TRIVIAL A VESSEL THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO DISTINGUISH IT AS THE ACTUAL PERSISTENT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE RIGHT CARDINAL VEIN DEVELOPMENT IN MAN A FORMATION OF THE TRANSVERSE BRANCH IN THE NECK NO OPPORTUNITY HAS OFFERED ITSELF OF OBSERVING THE TINE AND MODE OF ORIGIN OF THE TRANSVERSE BRANCH IN THE HUMAN EMBRYO THOUGH IT IS PROBABLY ORIGINALLY FORMED IN THE SAME WAY AS IN THE SHEEP AND GUINEA PIG INS AN EMBRYO OF FITHS OF AN INLCH IN142 MR MARSHALL ON THE DEVELOPMENT LENGTH PLATE III FIGS 1 2 THE CROSS BRANCH D WAS ALREADY FORMED OWING TO THE WIDTH OF THE HUMAN THORAX THE JUGULAR VEINS DO NOT APPROACH EACH OTHER CLOSELY AT THE ROOT OF THE NECK AS IN THE SHEEP THE CROSS BRANCH CONTINUES OF A MUCH GREATER LENGTH AND AT FIRST HORIZONTAL IN ITS DIRECTION ONLY ASSUMES AFTER A CONSIDERABLE TIME THE SOMEWHAT OBLIQUE POSITION WHICH IT PERMANENTLY HOLDS AS THE LEFT INNOMI NATE VEIN RATHKE DESCRIBES IT AS FORMED OPPOSITE THE POINT OF JUNCTION OF THE JUGULAR AND SUBCLAVIAN VEINS BUT IN THE EMBRYOS DISSECTED BY MYSELF IT IS A LITTLE LOWER DOWN THAN THAT POINT AND IMMEDIATELY ABOVE THE COMMENCING PERICARDIUM B OCCLUSION OF PART OF THE LEFT PRIMITIVE VEINS IT IS NOT UNTIL AFTER THE TRANSVERSE CONNECTING BRANCH IS ALREADY NEARLY AS LARGE AS EITHER JUGULAR VEIN THAT THE VENOUS CHANNELS DESTINED TO BE OCCLUDED BEGIN TO SHRINK PREVIOUSLY TO THE COMMENCEMENT OF THIS STAGE OF THE METAMORPHOSIS THE CARDINAL VEINS FIGS 1 2 B B HAVE MUCH DIMINISHED IN SIZE OWING TO THE WASTING OF THE WOLF FIAN BODIES 5 BUT THE TWO HALVES OF THE VENOUS SYSTEM ARE STILL QUITE SYMMETRICAL EXCEPT THAT THE ARCH OF THE RIGHT CARDINAL VEIN IS HIGHER UP THAN THE LEFT IN ACCORD ANCE WITH THE GREATER SIZE AND RELATIVE ALTITUDE OF THE CORRESPONDING LUNG AS ALREADY POINTED OUT IN THE SHEEP FROM OPPOSITE THE CROSS BRANCH THE TWO JUGULAR VEINS LESCEND BEHIND THE AURICULAR APPENDICES OUTSIDE THE PERICARDIUM TO BECOME CON TINUOUS WITH THE CANALS OF CUVIER C C WHICH HAVING RECEIVED THE CARDINAL VEINS IMMEDIATELY ENTER THE PERICARDIUM AND BEND INWARDS BENEATH THE AURICULAR PORTION OF THE HEART INTO WHICH THEY OPEN ONE ON EACH SIDE OF AND SOMEWHAT BEFORE THE IN FERIOR CAVA IN ADDITION TO A PART OF THE LEFT PRIMITIVE JUGULAR VEIN LYING OUTSIDE THE PERICAR DIUM BELOW THE CROSS BRANCH IN THE NECK IT WILL BE FOUND THAT IN THE HUMAN SUBJECT IN WHICH THERE IS NO LEFT AZYGOS AS IN THE SHEEP THE LEFT CARDINAL VEIN SHRINKS INTO AN

VEINS PERSIST NO TRANSVERSE BRANCH IS FORMED ACROSS THE ROOT OF THE NECK THOUGH A FREE COMMUNICATION EXISTS BETWEEN THE JUGULAR VEINS JUST BENEATH THE SKULL THE RIGHT AND LEFT SUPERIOR CAVE REMAIN INDEPENDENT OF EACH OTHER AS ORIGINALLY LAID DOWN AND EACH RECEIVES ITS OWN AZYGOS VEIN AMONGST THE MAMMALIA HOWEVER THERE APPEARS TO BE NO INSTANCE IN WHICH SOME CHANGE FROM THE COMMON PRIMITIVE TYPE DOES NOT TAKE PLACE THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE CLASS SO FAR AS IS KNOWN THERE IS THE ADDITION OF A COMMUNICATING BRANCH ACROSS THE ROOT OF THE NECK BETWEEN THE TWO ANTERIOR PRIMITIVE VENOUS TRUNKS IT IS FOUND EVEN IN THE LOW BIRDLIKE MONOTREMES AND SHOULD IT PROVE TO BE UNIVERSAL IT WILL CON STITUTE ONE CHARACTERISTIC MARK OF THE MAMMALIAN VENOUS SYSTEM THE FORMATION OF THIS TRANSVERSE COMMUNICATING

MALIAN SERIES SUPERADDED TO THIS PRELIMINARY STEP IN THE FOETAL DEVELOPMENT AND SUPERADDED ALSO IN THE HIGHEST FORMS OF ADULT MAMMALIA AND IN MAN IS FOUND AN OTHER CHANGE DEPENDING ON ONE OF TWO MODES OF PARTIAL OCCLUSION OF THE LEFT ANTERIOR PRIMITIVE VENOUS TRUNK IN THIS WAY THREE DIFFERENT PERMANENT CONDITIONS ARISE IN ALL OF THEM THE TRANS VERSE COMMUNICATION IN THE NECK EXISTS THE RIGHT VENOUS

CONDITION IN WHICH THE OCCLUSION IS OF THE GREATEST KNOWN EXTENTT THE PERSISTENT PORTION OF THE VEIN AFTER METAMORPHOSIS CON VEYS ONLY THE BLOOD FROM THE SUBSTANCE OF THE HEART AND FORMS A CARDIAC

INFERIOR CAVA THE HEPATIC VEINS ALWAYS CONCUR TO FORM A SHORT INFERIOR TRUNK WHICH OPENS INTO THE RIGHT AURICLE SO THE CONFLUENCE OF THE CORONARY AND OTHER CARDIAC VEINS MAY SET A LIKE LIMIT TO THE OCCLUSION OF THE LEFT ANTERIOR PRIMITIVE VENOUS TRUNK NEVERTHELESS IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE PROCESS MIGHT EXTEND TO THE CLOSURE OF ITS LOWER END OR CORONARY SINUS ALSO THE BLOOD FROM THE SUBSTANCE OF

SMALL VENA AZYGOS EXISTS ON THAT SIDE AND ENDS IN THE RIGHT VENA CAVA CLASS II TRANSVERSE BRANCH WANTING A FAILURE IN THE PRELIMINARY STEP OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CROSS BRANCH IN THE NECK NECESSARILY IMPLIES THE NONOCCLUSION OF EITHER OF THE LATERAL PRIMITIVE VEINS FOR THOUGH TWO SUPERIOR CAVE MAY COEXIST WITH THE TRANSVERSE COMMUNICATION IN THE NECK YET WHEN THE LATTER IS ABSENT EACH PRIMITIVE VEIN MUST CONTINUE TO RETURN THE BLOOD FROM ITS OWN SIDE OF THE UPPER HALF OF THE BODY IN SUCH INSTANCES THE CHARACTERISTIC CROSS BRANCH OF THE MAMMALIAN VENOUS SYSTEM IS WANTING THE CONDITION OF THE

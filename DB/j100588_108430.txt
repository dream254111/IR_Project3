Great Anterior Feins in Man and Mammalia including an Account of certain remnants of Fcetal Structure found in the Adult a Comparative View of these Great Veins in the different Mammalia and an Analysis of their occasional peculiarities in the Human Subject By JOHN MARSHALL FR CS late Demonstrator of Anatomy in University College Lon don Assistant Surgeon to the University College Hospital Communicated by Professor SHARPEY FRS Received June 19Read June 21 1849 THE principal object of the present paper is to state the result of observations on the metamorphosis of certain of the great veins in Man and Mammalia and on the relation between the primitive and final condition of these vessels both when they pass through their changes in the usual order and in cases of deviation from it It is well known that in the mammalian embryo the great veins entering the heart from the upper or anterior part of the body are originally symmetrical on the two sides and that in Man the Quadrumana and most of the higher orders of quadra peds the venous trunk of the left side undergoes occlusion whilst in other Maim malia that vessel continues and constitutes in the adult state a left vena cava an terior which passes down in front of the left lung and then along the back of the heart in the auriculoventricular groove to terminate in the right auricle Certain points of analogy between these different conditions are suggested by a careful exa mination of the great veins in adult hearts more especially of what is usually regarded in the human subject as the dilated termination of the great coronary vein in the right auricle This portion of the vessel Plate I fig 1 s which has muscular parietes is on account of its width usually named the coronary sinus Its length may be considered as defined by a valve x placed about an inch or more from its opening into the right auricle This valve which was known to VIEUSSENS has been again recently pointed out by Dr JOHN REIDt and is described by him as generally existing and formed of one or two segments In all the examinations which I have made I have found it present and always consisting of two segments a larger one placed on the side of the auriculoventricular furrow and a smaller one situated on the free side of the vein and therefore liable to be divided in slitting up  Traite de la Structure c du Cceur Toulouse 1715 p 56 t Cyc Anat and Phys Art Heart p 597134 MR MARSHALL ON THE DEVELOPMENT that vessel see Plate I Into the extremity of the coronary sinus as thus defined the great coronary vein g may be said to open its entrance being guarded by the valve alluded to and along the lower border of the sinus there enter three or four venous branches p p p which ascend from the back of the ventricles one of them generally forming the middle cardiac vein m the mouths of these branches are also almost invariably provided with fine valves consisting of one or two segments but beyond the coronary sinus and the larger valve first noticed no more valves are met with either in the trunk of the principal cardiac or coronary vein or in any of its tributary branches In the hearts of the Monkey Cat and Dog a precisely similar arrangement is ob served In those animals which possess a left vena cava superior the great cardiac or coronary vein ends in that additional venous trnnk as seen for example in the Mar supialia many of the Rodentia and in the Elephant Moreover in certain Ruminant and other animals as for example the Sheep Plate 1 fig 2 in which a large left azygos vein exists arching over the root of the left lung and thence pursuing the same course to the right auricle as the left vena cava superior in the cases already alluded to the coronary vein g opens into this azygos venous trunk ss In both these two conditions as I have observed in the Rabbit Hedgehog Ox Sheep and Pig the lower part of the large left venous trunk is always dilated and muscular and at the opening of the coronary vein into it there is found a large valve composed in some cases of one segment x and in others of two A series of small veins pmp ascending from the back of the heart join it at intervals between the valved entrance of the coronary vein and the opening of the venous trunk itself into the right auricle and lastly the mouths of these ascending cardiac veins are for the most part regularly provided with valves whilst on the contrary no valves exist along the continuation upwards of the large venous trunk at least in the neighbourhood of the heart nor are valves met with as a constant condition in any other part of the cardiac veins themselves On comparing in Man and Animals the arrangement of these vessels and the dis position of their valves I nwas led to conjecture that the dilated and somewhat muscular portion of the coronary vein usually named the coronary sinus Plate I fig 1 s together with its large and important opening t into the right auricle as seen in Man and such of the higher Mammalia as have no left vena cava superior or left azygos vein was strictly analogous to the expanded lower portion fig 2 s and auricular orifice t of those additional left venous trunks as found in other quadrupeds and in fact that it was the persistent lower part of the left anterior primitive venous trunk On this supposition the coronary vein proper in Man and the higher Mamninalia might be said to end in the socalled coronary sinus at the valved orifice above de scribed and thus its mode of termination instead of varying in different cases would be similar throughout the entire mnammalian seriesthe vessel in no case reachingOF THE GREAT ANTERIOR VEINS 135 the right auricle directly but always pouring its blood like the posterior cardiac veins generally into a larger venous trunk The analogy thus indicated between the coronary sinus on the one hand and the lower portion of the left vena cava superior or left vena azygos on the other is ap parent not only in their likeness as to shape and structure and the disposition of their branches and valves but also in the similarity of their situation direction and con nections with the heart and in the resemblance not altogether overlooked by anato mists of their respective openings into the right auricle According to RATHKE however whose authority is generally followed the left an terior primitive venous trunk in the human subject closes and entirely disappears in the progress of development from the root of the neck down to the heart But if on the contrary the coronary sinus as found in the adult condition in Man and some of the higher Mammalia be as is above suggested the analogue of or to express the fact in another form be the lower pervious portion of the left primitive rein might it not possibly happen that even on the fullyformed heart some remnant of its upper occluded portion should still exist above the valved entrance of the coronary vein into the coronary sinus Searching accordingly in the adult human heart I have found in upwards of twenty different instances certain parts or structures Plate I fig 1 o 1 v always clearly distinguishable though varying in distinctness which from their position and general character are undoubted remains of the upper portion of the left primitive venous trunk Analogous remnants of the left primitive vein are also to be seen in all those Mamn malia in whichas in the Dog the Cat and the Monkeythe same amount of oc clusion of that vessel occurs as in the human subject and a comparative examina tion of the arrangement of the veins in different animals of the various instances of deviation from the ordinary condition in Man and of the metamorphosis of these vessels in human and other embryos has sufficed to establish beyond a doubt the identity of the parts under consideration The results of the entire investigation together with due reference to the labours of others may be conveniently presented under the following heads 1 Development of the great anterior veins 2 Comparative view of the adult condition of these veins in Man and Mammalia 3 Analysis of their varieties in the human subject  In the thirteenth observation out of twentyfour I fortunately met with an example of double vena cava superior in the adult a rare and interesting variety in relation to the present subject Since then I have had presented to me a second example occurring in a child between four and five years old I may take the pre sent opportunity of thanking Dr SHARPEY Mr STREETER and Mr W BENNETT for aid in procuring materials for this investigation136 MR MARSHALL ON THE DEVELOPMENT I DEVELOPMENT OF THE GREAT ANTERIOR VEINS It has been shown by RATHKE to whom we are chiefly indebted for our know ledge of the development of the veins that in Man and Mammalia as in the Verte brata generally the blood of nearly all parts of the embryo is returned to the heart ly two pairs of venous trunks viz an anterior and a posterior pair placed symme trically in the lateral halves of the body Besides these however there is a median inferior venous trunk which forms in succession the termination of the omphalo mesenteric and umbilical veins and finally becomes the vena cava inferior Of the four lateral veins the anterior pair formed by branches from the head and neck constitute the jugular veins The posterior pair which return the blood from the Wolffian bodies and the hinder part of the embryo are called the cardinal veins The cardinal and the jugular vein of each side join to form a short wide vessel named the canal of CUVIER and again the two canals of CUvIER so named from their resemblance to the ductus Cuvieri in fishes running downwards and forwards at the sides of the cesophagus unite in front of that tube into a common trunk which immediately enters the yet undivided auricular portion of the heart In the subse quent enlargement of the yet single auricle this common trunk comes as it were to form part of that cavity into which accordingly the two canals of CUVIER henceforth open separately and thus represent two superior venve cavve one on each side When the Wolffian bodies disappear the cardinal veins diminish in size returning the blood from the hinder limbs and trunk of the embryo only In the mean time the intercostal veins are formed and united together by vertical anastomoses on each side so as to form the azygos and herniazygos veins Finally in Man the left cardinal vein becomes according to RATHKE entirely obliterated whilst the upper portion of the vein of the right side is probably concerned in the formation of the termination of the azygos vein In the meantime a transverse connecting branch is developed across the lower part of the neck between the two jugular veins This transverse branch is rapidly enlarged and then in the human embryo and also in those animals which have no lermanent venous trunk on the left side that portion of the original left jugular trunk which is situated lower down than the transverse branch or nearer to the heart and also the left canal of CUVIER which is continuous with it shrink and disappear the enlarging transverse branch across the neck forms the left innominate vein and the lower part of the right jugular with its canal of CUvIER receiving the remains of the right cardinal vein now the terminal part of the vena azygos constitutes the vena cava superior as ordinarily met with thus the metamorphosis is complete In the Sheep however it was observed by RATHKE that the upper part of the left  RATHKE  Ueber die friiheste Form und die Entwickelung

Naturwissenschaftliche Seminar bei der Unix versitdt zu Kdnigsberg Kbnigsberg 1838OF THE GREAT ANTERIOR VEINS 137 cardinal vein and the left canal of CUVIER remain open to form the left azygos vein present in that animnal whilst that part of the left primitive venous trunk which is situated between the canal of CUvIER and the junction of the left subclavian and jugular veins disappears and only a subordinate twig is subsequently found in its place which ends in a small left superior intercostal vein Lastly in those animals which in the adult condition have a right and left superior vena cava the left primitive jugular vein together with the corresponding canal of CUVIER remains pervious throughout life This knowledge of the common type of formation of the veins in the Vertebrata and of their metamorphosis in certain species by partial occlusion suggested to RATHKE the explanation of the occasional occurrence of double vena cava superior in the human subject as the result of an arrest of deve lopment Nevertheless the details of this metamorphosis have not been fully indi cated nor as far as I am aware have any persistent remnants of the foetal structure been recognized in the adult By RATHiKE himself the left primitive vein is said in Man to diminish and entirely disappear from opposite the left end of the transverse vein of the neck down to the heart but this seems to have been an inference from the known adult condition and I do not know that either he or others have given any description or delineation of the development of these veins as actually traced in the human embryo The metamorphosis of the primitive lateral and symmetrical venous trunks in the higher Mammalia and in Man may be said to consist of two fundamental changes viz a the formation of the cross branch or communication in the neck and b the occlusion of a greater or less portiotn of the left primitive venous trunk Besides this however there are during embryonic life c certain concurrent and subsequent alterations in the size position and direction of the venous trunks which finally re main pervious Lastly d there are the changes which take place after birth Development in the Sheep a Formation of the Transverse Communication in the Neck In embryos measuring  thls of an inch wellpreserved in spirit and in which the blood was hardened in the veins no appearance of a cross branch was discernible The earliest satisfactory indications of its commencement were met with in embryos from lths to 5ths of an inch in length In these Plate II figs 1 2 3 two little spurshaped points filled with hardened blood projected towards each other fromn the inner borders of the jugular trunks asa immediately above the commencing peri cardiurn on a level with the subdivision of the ascending aorta In solne cases no intermediate portion of vein between these points could be detected but in others the connection was evidently completed by a material more opake than that around which could be often raised as an indistinct narrow cord containing howevem no MDCCCL T138 MR MARSHALL ON THE DEVELOPMENT hardened blood fig 5 d Even in embryos as long as 17ths of an inch fig 4 no red line could be traced quite across the neck although the lateral primitive veins were turgid with blood and presented two conical projections at the situation of the cross branch This cross branch is supposed to be formed by the enlargement of a previously developed vessel of almost capillary dimensions perhaps one of several such vessels passing across the neck but it is possible that it might be formed in the same way as the other great vessels The appearances above described would suggest the idea that this transverse branch was formed by the budding out and subsequent junction of two opposite points of the older veins but this appearance is probably owing merely to the vessel being smaller and empty of blood in the middle of its course or to its being accidentally broken at that point but still it would seem that the extre mities of the new transverse vein in connection with the older vessels are at first always enlarged more than the intermediate portion In recent embryos of the Guinea Pig measuring about half an inch in length I have twice recognized the transverse branch as a very minute continuous vessel passing quite across the neck between the two jugular veins just above the pericardium In one very early embryo y6oths of an inch long a small vessel evidently a vein traversed the neck higher up supported by the branchial arch which was being transformed into the lower jaw the lower cross branch was not yet formed in this case During the widening of the cross branch the two jugular trunks aa at that point gradually approach each otherthe distance between them absolutely as well as relatively decreasing compare figs 2 and 6 representing embryos of ths and  ths of an inch in length Instead of descending parallel with each other these veins now incline to the middle line of the neck opposite the cross branch and assisted by the shortening and widening out of that vessel they appear at length to coalesce almost by lateral adaptation before any diminution of the left primitive vein has begun to take place fig 7 embryo 1 inch 2ths long In later embryos fig 8 1 inch and mths long fig 10 11 inch long in which the neck is already becoming elongated by the time that the occlusion of the left primitive vein is accomplished the two jugular veins having received the large super ficial veins of the neck and those from the anterior limbs are so closely applied to each other and their connecting branch is become so entirely absorbed into them that they join together at a very acute angle or rather the vein of the left side now the left innominate vein runs continuously into the lower patt of the right primitive vein or superior vena cava whilst the right innominate vein appears to fall into this large continuous trunk at an acute angle Atstill later periods when the vertebral column projects prominently forward at the lower end of the slender neck immediately above the narrow aperture of the thorax this obliquity of the junction between the innominate veins is as marked as in the adult animnalOF THE GREAT ANTERIOR VEINS 139 b Occlusion of a portion of the Left Primitive Vein Before the commencement of this stage of the metamorphosis the jugular trunks are closely approximated and open freely into each other by means of the wide and very short communicating branch fig 7 d Previously to this change also that por tion of both primitive jugulars which is situated below the cross branch becomes elongated in accordance with the growth of the thorax and now inclining outwards descends through a much longer course upon the pericardiurn beneath the pleura to join the cardinal vein of its own side and end in the corresponding canal of CuviER It is just this portion of the left primitive jugular vein viz from the transverse branch in the neck to the commencement of the left canal of CUVIER which becomes closed in the Sheep In embryos measuring 1 inch and 1 line fig 7 the vessel at has either not begun or is only just beginning to shrink but so rapidly does the pro cess take place that in others scarcely 1 line longer fig 8 the vessel is already closed and now appears as a semitransparent cord o extending from the point of junction of the primitive jugular trunks in the neck to the arch formed by the left cardinal vein b and left canal of CUVIER c This cord is finer at its lower end it lies at first in front of the aorta and then passes down close to the pericardiumD on the left side of the ductus arteriosus it is in contact below with the left pleura the par vagum descends behind it and it is crossed by the phrenic nerve Close behind the upper end of this cord but not actually connected with it a considerable vein formed by the left vertebral and a large perforating intercostal from the back joins the under side of the left innominate vein In later embryos the abovementioned cord becomes less and less distinct in an embryo measuring 12 inch long fig 10 it cannot be continuously traced and in a fetal sheep 4 inches in length from the vertex to the tail it is not perceptible In its place however there is found a long ridge or elevation of the pericardium containing fibrous tissue which may be followed from below upwards close to the left side of the large ductus arteriosus in a direction towards the middle of the root of the neck Above the pericardial sac the traces of it are almost entirely lost c 0oncurrent and subsequent Changes in the Pervious Vessels In size As the left primitive vein is undergoing occlusion the lower part of the right jugular vein figs 8 10 a and the right canal of CUVIER simply enlarge as RATHKE states to form the superior vena cava The adjoining part of the right car dinal vein having first shrunk in consequence of the wasting of the Wolffian body remains for a considerable time as a right azygos vein equaling in size the left azygos bout about the middle of fectal life it is smaller than the vein on the left side and afterwards its connection with the right intercostal veins being gradually cut off it slowly diminishes until it exists only as a very small vessel or sometimes wholly disappears The left cardinal vein b on the contrary forms after the dis appearance of thle cor responding Wolffian body a left vena azygos which though for T 2140 MR MARSHALL ON THE DEVELOPMENT a time of the same size as the right azygos afterwards surpasses it in consequence of receiving the lower right intercostal veins in addition to almost all those of its own side The left canal of CUVIER c reduced greatly in width after the occlusion of the primitive jugular vein constitutes the intrapericardial part of the left azygos vein and with the rest of that vessel forms a venous arch which turns over the root of the left lung and is connected above with the cordlike vestige of the occluded vein o In position and direction The cardinal veins in order to unite with the jugular veins in the corresponding canals of CUVIER bend forwards above the commencing lungs figs 1 and 24 4 from which they are for a time separated by the upper end of the Wolffian bodies 5 5 The rudimentary right lung being almost from the commencement larger and somewhat higher up in the thorax than the left the right cardinal vein b even at a very early period see figs 2 and 9 reaches higher than the vein of the left side   a peculiarity in position which subsequently increases so that in a foetus of 4 inches in length the arch of the right azygos rises three lines higher up in the thorax than that of the left vein The cardinal veins like the jugulars are altogether outside the pericardiun but as soon as that sac is formed the canals of CUvIER are found almost entirely within it At first figs 1 2 3 c c these canals pass horizontally forwards and inwards to the back of the auricular portion of the heart into which they open on the same level one on either side in front of the inferior cava but as the lungs enlarge and occupy nore of the thoracic cavity the Cuvierian canals have to descend more and more obliquely in front of the roots of those organs to reach the heart figs 7 to 10 In accordance with the higher position of the root of the right lung this change in direc tion is more marked in the right canal of CUVIER or future vena cava superiorl The heart itself in the progress of growth becomes slightly twisted especially at its base or auricular part its right border being turned somewhat upwards supposing the thorax to lbe placed vertically fig 9 embryo 1 inch and 2 lines long the parts being seen from behind Hence the enlarged right canal of CUVIER C or upper vena cava reaches the future right auricle sooner and more directly than the smaller left canal c or left azygos venous trunk the former having a comparatively short and almost vertical course whilst the latter after having descended in front of thle root of the left lung has to turn beneath the base of the heart to gain its destined end in the right auricle At the same time the position of the openings of the meta iorphosed canals of CUvIER in the future right auricle undergo a change for instead of both of themn being placed as at first on the same level one on each side of the inferior cava the orifice of the right canal or upper cava opens widely into the highest part of the auricle nearly in a line with the lower cava e whilst the left canal or left azygos ends at the lower and back part of the auricle close to the commencing septum The serous layer of the pericardium is at first equally reflected over both the Cuvierian canals but in timne whilst it covers only a smaller and smaller part of the anterior surface of the right canal or upper cava it forms a more anld moreOF THE GREAT ANTERIOR VEINS 141 distinctfold or duplicature fig 10 c in which the left canal or left azygos trunk is lodged as it passes down in front of the left pulmonary vessels to reach the side of the left auricle immediately behind the appendix Beyond that point the vein as it lies on the back of the left auricle and runs along the auriculoventricular groove to reach the right auricle is also covered by the serous layer of the pericardiuin In the heart of a feetus 4 inches in length several small veins from the substance of the left ventricle may be seen ending in the lower part of the left azygos trunk and amongst them one which joins it at an acute angle is the future coronary vein d Changes at Birth When after birth the short and wide ductus arteriosus shrinks the long ridge of the pericardium with its contained fibrous tissue already described as resting upon that vessel in the position of the occluded left vein becomes closely applied to the left side of the aortic arch and may be traced in the direction of a line Irawn from the point of junction of the innominate veins at the root of the neck down to the highest point of the arch of the left azygos vein Within the pericardium the trunk of the left azygos occupies its properfold of the serous membrane and receives shortly before its termination in the right auricle as seen in Plate I fig 2 the coronary vein of the heart g and two posterior cardiac branches p m besides a third smaller one p which might almost be said to end at once in the right auricle The mouth t of this left azygos venous trunk is situated to the left of the orifice of the inferior cava e close to the interauricular septum and below and behind the fossa ovalis like that of the left superior cava in the lower Mamnmalia and in Birds It has no rrhebesian valve which is represented in the Sheep merely by a slight ridge of the auricular parietes At the entrance of the coronary vein into the left azygos there is however a large distinct valve x consisting of one strong segment The two cardiac veins succeeding it are each guarded by finer valves of two segments and the third vein generally by a single segment Along the course of the coronary vein there are from one to four other valves consisting usually of one segment but sometimes of two Lastly the right azygos is now a much less important vein than that of the left side it reaches from 3 to 5 inches higher in the chest and is so small as to have been said by some anatoinists including RATHKE to be always wanting Occasionally once in five observations it was found to be so trivial a vessel that it was difficult to distinguish it as the actual persistent representative of the right cardinal vein Development in Man a Formation of the Transverse Branch in the Neck No opportunity has offered itself of observing the tine and mode of origin of the transverse branch in the human embryo though it is probably originally formed in the same way as in the Sheep and Guinea Pig Ins an embryo of fiths of an inlch in142 MR MARSHALL ON THE DEVELOPMENT length Plate III figs 1 2 the cross branch d was already formed Owing to the width of the human thorax the jugular veins do not approach each other closely at the root of the neck as in the Sheep the cross branch continues of a much greater length and at first horizontal in its direction only assumes after a considerable time the somewhat oblique position which it permanently holds as the left innomi nate vein RATHKE describes it as formed opposite the point of junction of the jugular and subclavian veins but in the embryos dissected by myself it is a little lower down than that point and immediately above the commencing pericardium b Occlusion of part of the Left Primitive Veins It is not until after the transverse connecting branch is already nearly as large as either jugular vein that the venous channels destined to be occluded begin to shrink Previously to the commencement of this stage of the metamorphosis the cardinal veins figs 1 2 b b have much diminished in size owing to the wasting of the Wolf fian bodies 5 but the two halves of the venous system are still quite symmetrical except that the arch of the right cardinal vein is higher up than the left in accord ance with the greater size and relative altitude of the corresponding lung as already pointed out in the Sheep From opposite the cross branch the two jugular veins lescend behind the auricular appendices outside the pericardium to become con tinuous with the canals of CUVIER C C which having received the cardinal veins immediately enter the pericardium and bend inwards beneath the auricular portion of the heart into which they open one on each side of and somewhat before the in ferior cava In addition to a part of the left primitive jugular vein lying outside the pericar dium below the cross branch in the neck it will be found that in the human subject in which there is no left azygos as in the Sheep the left cardinal vein shrinks into an insignificant branch and entirely disappears as a distinct trunk whilst the greater part of the left canal of CuviER placed within the pericardium is also closed  its last part however situated on the back of the left auricle remaining permanently open This pervious portion of the Cuvierian canal eventually forms the coronary sinus The first step towards this occlusion consists in a gradual shrinking of the left primitive venous channel from the left end of the cross branch down to the back of the heart as shown in an embryo of 1 inch and 23ths in length Plate III fig 3 rrThe upper portion of the vein lies upon the aorta and ductus arteriosus beneath the left pleura whilst the lower portion within the pericardium crosses in front of the vessels of the left lung lodged in a duplicature of the serous membrane reminding one of the fold in which the left azygos vein is contained in the adult Sheep The lower end of the vessel placed on the back of the left auricle is more dilated than the Irest In a more advanced embryo 1 inch and 2 ths long the closure was complete and had pro bably been accomplished a considerable time fig 4 The place of the primitive vein is now seen to be occupied by aJine cord c which may be followed from the underOF THE GREAT ANTERIOR VEINS 143 side of the left innominate vein down to the back of the auricle This cord is covered by the pleura and crossed by the left phrenic nerve it descends in front of the par vagum upon the side of the aorta and ductus arteriosus to the left pulmonary artery opposite to which it penetrates the pericardium Within this sac it crosses the small interval between the left pulmonary artery and veins enclosed in a minutefiold of the serous membrane and then becoming applied to the back of the left auricle expands into a small conical pouch c which is narrow and pointed above but wider below where it opens into the right part of the yet undivided auricular cavity No left superior intercostal vein could be found in this embryo In no other foetus examined did the occlusion of the primitive left jugular vein ex tend quite up to the cross branch or left innominate vein for there always remained a pervious but shrunken portion of the primitive vessel which as will immediately be shown forms the trunk of the left superior intercostal vein This fact is illustrated in fig 5 i In a somewhat later embryo fig 6 the cord of the occluded vein may be traced distinctly from the trunk of the left superior intercostal vein i which is here larger than usual passing down through the fibrous layer of the pericardium and entering its now narrow fold of the serous membrane c Still later Plate IV fig 9 the traces of a continuous cord above the pericardium are difficult to follow and at the full period of foetal life it is generally impossible to find in that situation more than a few fine vertical fibrous bands lying close beneath the pleura The little fold of the pericardium so often alluded to soon after the closure of its contained vessel sinks as it were into the interval between the left pulmonary artery and veins Plate III figs 5 6 c where it is found in all future stages and increases in size with the other parts Plate IV fig 9 v Below the fold the remnant of the closed vein descends upon the left auricle and may be traced for a time as a slight ridge but after wards when the auricle enlarges as an opake line or streak passing close beneath the lowermost pulmonary vein down to the apex of the pouchlike pervious portion of the primitive vein Plate oiI figs 4 5 6 Plate lV figs 7 8 10 c and 9 1 By the period of birth fig 11 this opake streak 1 has usually become interrupted or obscured c Concurrent and subsequent Changes in the Pervious Vessels Contemporaneously with the shutting off of the left primitive venous channels the cross branch in the neck Plate III figs 1 to 6 d enlarges and together with a short portion of the left primitive vein below the entrance of the left subelavian forms the left innominate vein a small piece of the right primitive jugular included between the entrance of the right subelavian and the junction with the cross branch becomes the right vena innominata whilst the remainder of the right primitive jugular below the cross branch together with the corresponding canal of CUvIER becomes widened and forms the superior vena cava h At the junction of its two constituent parts the vena cava receives the metamorphosed right cardinal vein now the vena azygos in which the right superior intercostal vein generally ends144 MR MARSHALL ON THE DEVELOPMENT The metamorphosis of the pervious vessels on the left side is much more corn plicated Outside the pericardiumIn one embryo already mentioned Plate III fig 4 the left primitive jugular vein was converted into a cord c quite up to the cross branch or left innominate vein and in that instance no trace whatever could be detected of the left cardinal vein In such cases as the one referred to the left superior inter costal vein may be subsequently formed through the development of small collateral veins or it may be entirely wantingits intercostal branches ending then in some other vessels Usually however a piece of the left primitive j ugular vein immediately helow the cross branch remains pervious and constitutes the trunk off the left superior intercostal vein fig 5 i which passes over the side of the aorta at a higher point as the thorax becomes elongated during development The left cardinal vein may be entirely withered but in some cases fig 7 the left primitive jugular remains open from the cross branch quite down to the commencement of the canal of CUVIER where it receives the diminished left cardinal vein b thus metamorphosed into the lowest branch of an unusually large left superior intercostal vein i This vein be sides intercostal branches may be very early found to receive thymic pericardiac and niediastinal branches and often a bronchial vein In all cases however the left car dinal vein is effectually cut off from the occluded left canal of CUVIER c and is lost or interrupted at its lower part so that the left intercostal system becomes broken up into several streams Within the pericardiumThe pouchlike pervious portion of the left primitive vein seen on the back of the left auricle Plate III figs 4 5 6 c Plate IV figs 7 8 s is metamorphosed partlv into a small oblique auricular vein Plate IV figs 9 10 11 o and partly into the coronary sinus s On examining the back of the heart in a series of early embryos Plate IV it will be seen as already noticed in the Sheep that in accordance with a certain twisting which takes place in this organ important peculiarities in length and direction are early impressed upon the two canals of CUVIER which are originally quite symme trical The right canal figs 1 3 5 c or future superior cava passes down perpendi cularly from the neck becomes widened and shortened soon reaches the future right auricle and enters by a wide orifice into the upper part of that cavity nearly in a line with the inferior cava e The left canal c whilst diminishing in size pursues a more circuitous course along the left auricular cavity beneath the base of the heart to reach the lower and left part of the future right auricle into which it opens by a constricted orifice surrounded by an opake welldefined border Even at a very early period when this left canal of CUVIER has scarcely begun to shrink its lower part is found on cutting it open figs 2 4 to be a distinct vascular tube applied to and connected with the back of the future left auricle but not opening into that cavity whilst its orifice maintains its connection with the right portion

to the right side This being premised it is easy to follow the changes which the lower pervious portion of the left canal of CuviEn undergoes after the complete occlu sion of its upper part represented now by the opake streak fig 9 1 on the wall of the left auricle and by the minute fold of the pericardium v already described For a time the lower part of this canal persists as a conical

observed figs 9 10 and on cutting open the veins at this period a narrow oblique venous channel o tapering to a point as it ascends to the left along the back of the auricle may be traced from the point of entrance of the true coronary vein g upwards to the opake streak 1 seen on the wall of the auricle whilst below the entrance of the coronary vein the venous channel becomes dilated s as it passes to the right re ceives several cardiac veins including generally the middle cardiac and ends in the lower part of the right auricle close to the interauricular septum by a somewhat contracted orifice which is guarded by a rudimentary valve This wider lower por tion of the persistent venous channel can even now be recognized in all respects as the coronary sinus and the valve beginning to form at its auricular orifice is the Thebesian valve The opening of the true coronary vein into it is marked by a sharplyridged margin but as yet there is no valve there As development advances to the full period of foetal life fig 11 the proper coronary vein g and the coronary sinus s become gradually more continuous in direction than heretofore but the difference between them can be easily discerned even externally The muscularity of the sinus as distinguished fiomn the vein be comes evident and the opening of the latter into the former is protected by a1 valve the two segments of which are for a time narrower in proportion than in the adult Above the entrance or this vein into the sinus a rounded recess leads upwards and to the left into the small oblique vein o which taking the course of the primitive vessel of which it is evidently the remnant runs along the back of the left auricle about halfway to the root of the pulmonary veins and there ends in the opake streak 1 previously mentioned This small oblique vein is crossed superficially by the muscular fibres of tile left auricle it is peculiarly straight in its course and receives tortuous branches from the walls of the auricle MDiccC u146 MR MARSHALL ON THE DEVELOPMENT d Changes which take place at Birth The shrinking of the ductus arteriosus and the simultaneous enlargement of the pulmonary artery and veins and of the left auricle are accompanied by changes in the intrapericardial remnants of the left primitive vein The pericardial fold is as it were invaded by the enlarging pulmonary vessels and becomes relatively shorter and more deeply concealed between the left pulmonary artery and the subjacent vein The narrow opake streak running around the root of the pulmonary vein and along the back of the left auricle pursues a longer course and becomes attenuated or broken up Lastly as the left auricle expands the oblique vein is less evident and the true coronary vein and the coronary sinus become more alike to each other in direction and diameter Vestiges in the Adult Condition Plate I fig 1 Plate VThe relation of the left superior intercostal vein to the primitive vessel in different cases has been already noticed Commencing from the trunk of this vein Plate V i there may frequently be traced a few verticalfibrous bands f lying beneath the pleura posterior to the phrenic nerve and usually accompanied by small bloodvessels and by a fine branch of the vagus nerve 13 Generally one of these bands may be actually followed to the left superior intercostal vein and in most cases they are continued downwards through the pericardium into the pericardial fold This fold Plate I fig 1 and Plate V v which might be named the vestigialfold of thepericardium may be compared to the broad ligament of the liver after the closure of the umbilical vein As far as I know it has hitherto escaped attention though it is probably always present in the ordinary condition as I have found it in twentytwo adult hearts In one instance it could not be distinguished in consequence of com plete adhesion of the pericardial surfaces and in another adventitious bands of inem brane occupied its usual position Sometimes it is obscured by fat deposited within or near it To demonstrate this vestigial fold and the opake streak continuous with it below which are almost unavoidably injured by dividing the great vessels within the pericardial sac the heart great vessels and pericardium should be removed in con nection with the root of the left lung after which on opening the pericardium and drawing asunder the left pulmonary artery and the subjacent pulmonary vein the fold will be seen passing nearly vertically across the deep interval between those vessels Plate V v Besides a duplicature of the serous layer of the pericardium including cellular and fatty tissue the vestigial fold contains some fibrous bands small bloodvessels and nervous filaments Its opake welldefined and curved miar gin is commonly from half to three quarters of an inch in length but I have once found it measure upwards of an inch and a half It varies in thickness in different  SENAC states Trait6 du Mouvement du Coeur

inch in depth according to the nature of the interval between the pulmonary artery and vein Above the pulmonary artery the vestigial fold blends with the pericardiun and its fibrous bundles may frequently be traced into those already described as passing beneath the pleura up to the left superior intercostal vein Its lower end is lost on the side of the left auricle in the narrow opake and often interrupted streak 1 which courses around the root of the lower left pulmonary vein This streak represents the part of the left Cuvierian canal which has undergone the greatest amount of obliteration and it is sometimes almost entirely wanting In the same situation scattered whitish bands are com monly seen beneath the serous membrane of the back of the left auricle closely con nected with the muscular fibres and descending towards the oblique vein amongst them there are some fine branches of nerves They mark only the track of the pre viously existing vein In some instances a prominent ridge exists in their place upon the back of the auricle The small oblique auricular vein o which has been shown to form part of the per vious portion of the left canal of CUvIER is remarkably constant and indeed has been recognized by some of the early anatomists as a branch of the great coronary vein This short vessel is readily distinguishable from its tributary branches by its direct course a character not possessed by the cardiac veins generally Moreover it is as it were imbedded in the walls of the left auricle so that it appears covered by muscular bundles like the coronary sinus itself Frequently it measures from half an inch to an inch in length and sometimes is as large as a crowquill but more commonly it is smaller and will admit only the head of a pin I have once seen it an inch and a quarter in length and as wide as a common goosequill but however large it may be its opening into the coronary sinus is never provided with a valve Its upper end either tapers and ends in a fine branch or as more frequently found especially in young subjects it does not alter much in width as it ascends but ter ninates rather abruptly and receives close to its extremity one or two tortuous lateral branches of nearly equal size In some instances I have found a long slender vessel ascending from the upper part of this short vein along the back of the auricle into the vestigial fold and ulti mately through the pericardium just above the root of the left lung It there joins It is represented by RuyscH Thesaur iv tab 3 fig 1 and also by SENAC op cit planche 2 HALLER Oper Minora t i lib i p 11 speaks of one particular branch of the great coronary vein coming from the left auricle THEILE SOEMMERRINGS Anatomy has a similar statement This small vein has also been occasionally indicated in drawings of the heart given for other purposes and it may be seen readily in most injected hearts preserved in anatomical museums VIEussENs Traite du Cceur pp 2 55

returning the blood from the pericardial sac HALLER remarks Op Min t i lib i p 11 note that he has never seen this vein of the pericardium which is certainly represented by VIEUSSENS both longer and wider than according to my experience the oblique vein ever is in the human heart u 2148 MR MARSHALL ON THE DEVELOPMENT a small branch descending from one of the veins accompanying the phrenic nerve and so is connected with the left superior intercostal vein This slender vessel which receives many little branches along its course is not however part of the metamor phosed left primitive vein but is formed by the enlargement of the minute inoscu lating veins of the parts which occupy the position of the obliterated vessel In one case indeed which was carefully dissected the lower end of this small vein was found not to coincide with the trunk of the oblique auricular vein but to fall into one of the lateral tortuous branches of that persistent vessel The arrangement of the valves in the coronary sInus in the adult has been fully de scribed in the introduction to this paper The abrupt commencement of the sinus pointed out by Dr J REID is owing to a rounded recess formed on the auricular side of the principal valve Plate I fig 1 x into which the unvalved orifice of the short oblique vein o is constantly found to open The sinus itself is described by the same observer as leaving  the appearance of a muscular reservoir placed at the ter mination of the coronary vein similar to the auricles auricle at the termination of the two cavve  but its relations to the left primitive vein in the embryo and its analogies in the lower animals have not hitherto been mentioned by anatomical writers though Professor SHARPEY has been accustomed to point out in his lectures the resemblance between the coronary sinus and the lower end of the left superior cava II COMPARATIVE VIEW OF THE GREAT ANTERIOR VEINS IN MAN AND MAMMALIA Our knowledge of these veins in most of the Mammalia is still deficient and many of the descriptions which exist are incomplete in points of detail To the information gathered from other sources I may add the results of observations made by myself on the veins of the Hledgehog Rabbit Rat Mouse and Bat of the common Mole the Sheep Ox Hog Guinea Pig and Horse and of the Polecat the Seal the Dog the Cat and the Monkey  Since the observations and deductions contained in this paper were completed and the paper itself entirely written I have seen in the 4th and 5th No of MULLERs Archiv for 1848 a short but very interesting come munication by Dr BARDELEBEN of Giessen entitled  Ueber vena azygos hemiazygos und coronaria cordis bei Saugethieren in which after classifying the different Mammalia according to the condition of the Azygos and Hemiazygos veins as observed by RATHKE op cit 1838 and himself into four groupsviz I those having neither of these veins II those having both III those having an azygos only and IV those having a hemiazygos onlyhe arrives from a comparison of the adult condition of the veins in the different cases at the same conclusion as myself in regard to the analogy of the coronary sinus with the lower part of the left vena azygos or left vena cava superior  If he says  the left canal of CUVIER continues in connection with the left jugular vein so as subsequently to form the left vena cava superior the coronary vein is said to open into the left superior cava If all the blood is conveyed across the neck by the anastomosing branch between the left and the right jugular veins and the portion of the left jugular between this cross branch and the left canal of CUVIEx disappears the lastnamed vessel continues to be connected with the intercostal system only and then the coronary vein may be said to end in the left or hemiazygos or vice versa Finally this connec tion of the left canal of CuvIEn being also obliterated there remains only that portion of the vessel in whichOF THE GREAT ANTERIOR VEINS 149 All the varieties of arrangement hitherto observed in the great anterior veins of the Mammalia may be classified according to the amount of deviation which they present from the type pointed out by RATHKE as originally common to all the Vertebrata viz that of four lateral primitive trunks The modifications of this type observed in the coldblooded Vertebrata are strictly of a subordinate kind affecting merely the relative size which particular vessels ulti mately acquire Even in birds there is no fundamental deviation from the original type The four primitive lateral veins persist No transverse branch is formed across the root of the neck though a free communication exists between the jugular veins just beneath the skull The right and left superior cave remain independent of each other as originally laid down and each receives its own azygos vein Amongst the Mammalia however there appears to be no instance in which some change from the common primitive type does not take place Throughout the whole class so far as is known there is the addition of a communicating branch across the root of the neck between the two anterior primitive venous trunks It is found even in the low birdlike Monotremes and should it prove to be universal it will con stitute one characteristic mark of the mammalian venous system The formation of this transverse communicating branch which of necessity pre cedes the occlusion of the left primitive vein in the higher mammalian embryo asp pears as the first the simplest and the only change in the lowest forms of the mam malian series Superadded to this preliminary step in the foetal development and superadded also in the highest forms of adult Mammalia and in Man is found an other change depending on one of two modes of partial occlusion of the left anterior primitive venous trunk In this way three different permanent conditions arise In all of them the trans verse communication in the neck exists The right venous trunk always constitutes the vena cava superior of that side but the left vein either formsA a similar large venous trunk on that side named a left vena cava superior which receives the left jugular and subclavian veins the left intercostals and certain cardiac veins or B it is reduced to a smaller left venous trunk which receives merely the left intercostal veins and some cardiac veins or C it remains as a still smaller vessel receiving only a few cardiac veins from the substance of the heart These three conditions accordingly are distinguished by severally presenting A A right and a left vena cava superior B A right vena cava superior and a left azygos venous trunk C A right vena cava superior and a left cardiac venous trunk or coronary sinus the veins from the substance of the heart terminate and which will then be recognized as the great coronary vein This is the condition in Man and in most Mammalia In fact in no mammalian does the left canal of CUVIER entirely disappear Even in cases where by far the largest portion of it is obliterated that part which runs along the posterior transverse furrow of the heart remains as the trunk of the cardiac veins I have availed myself of Dr BARDELEBENS memoir to introduce some additional examples of varieties of the great veins in animals150 MR MARSHALL ON THE DEVELOPMENT Group A A right and a let rena cava superiorThis condition exists in a large number of the lower Mammalia viz in the Monotremata and Marsupialiat in most Rodentia as in the Dormouse Marmotte Rat Ecohimys Mouse Squirrel Beaver Hainster Mole of the Cape Iare and Rabbit4 It is found also in the Elephant1 amongst Pachydermnata  and in tile Hedgehog and Bat amongst Insectivora and Cheiroptera In all such cases the cross branch in the neck when sought for has been found The left vena cava superior always descends in front of the root of the left lung and then turns beneath the base of the heart and after receiving the great coronary and other cardiac veins in its course opens into the right auricleT Oxving to subordinate modifications in the azygos veins this group may be again subdivided as follows  a An azygos vein on each side a Of equal size Ex Monotremes Marsupials b b Of unequal size a Left azygos the larger Ex IIedgehog Rat Mouse  Right azygos the larger Ex Rabbit b An azygos vein on one side only a A left azygos only Er  b A right azygos

Sheept Goat Ox t Dicotyles and Moschus javensis and in the Horset It is also present in the common Molet The cross branch in the neck is necessarily present and forms the left innominate vein The left azygos trunk arching over the root of the corresponding lung de scends in front of it and then turns like the left vena cava superior in the former group beneath the base of the heart to reach the right auricle being first joined by the great coronary and some other cardiac veins Several gradations in the size of this left azygos trunk are met with in this group which further observation on recent animals would probably render more complete and which conduct by degrees to the third group where the left venous trunk re duced to its smallest persistent remnant receives only veins fronm the substance of the heart Thus in the Hog the left azygos trunk is very large and returns the blood not only from its own side but from the lowermost intercostal spaces of the right side also In the Sheep and Ox it is comparatively speaking smaller Finally in the HJorse it is reduced to a very fine vessel so that the left venous trunk conveys scarcely more than the blood from the cardiac veins and in one case I found it quite closed as it passed along the left auricle 11 This gradual diminution of the left azygos trunk is accompanied by an equivalent increase in the size of the right azygos vein For example the right azygos is smnall and sometimes even wanting in the Hog it is always an insignificant branch in the Sheep it is very evident in the Ox and very large in the Horse In the lastnamed animal it returns most of the blood from the left intercostal spaces also and thus exhibits the reverse of the condition observed in the Hog and approaches in this respect the characters of the third and last group  EuSTACHIIUS op cit p 273 describes the left azygos in the Ox Goat Sheep and Hog as passing over the left bronchus and states that the coronary vein ends in it BARTHOLINE THOM Hist Anat 84 Cent ii p 322 appears to have seen the left azygos in the heart of a lamb LANCISI Epist de vena sine pari MoR GAGNI s Advers Anat V p 80 mentions the left vena azygos in the same animals

Op cit p 80  It is said by RATHKE to be absent in the Horse and by BARDELEBEN in the Ass  The transition from this to the third group is exemplified not only in the Horse and Ass among Solipeds but also in the Ruminantia for I find that in the injected heart of the Camel Museum of the Royal Coll of Surgeons London Preparations 111 112 the only trace of a left azygos visible consists apparently of a rather large oblique branch of the coronary vein on the back of the left auricle The injected heart of the Tapir Mus Royal Coll Surgeons Preparation 105 in which animal BARDELEBEN says the left azygos is wanting also exhibits a similar condition the oblique vein being so large that it may be a rudimentary left azygos vein152 MR MARSHALL ON THE DEVELOPMENT Group C A right vena cava superior and a left cardiac venous trunk or coronary sinusThis arrangement prevails in the higher Mammalia as in the Whale Dol phin and Porpoise among Cetacea in the Sealt Walrus Dogt Catt Tiger Hyaena Polecatf and Ermine among Carnivora in the Quadrumana as for ex ample in two small species of Monkeyt and lastly in the human subject The left primitive trunk now reduced to a cardiac vein forms the coronary sinus with its small oblique branch on the back of the left auricle and havi ug received the great coronary and some other cardiac veins opens into the right auricle The oblique vein is more or less evident in different cases Thus it is large in the human sub ect very apparent in the Dolphin smaller in the Porpoise and the Dog less evident in the Whale and Walrus and very small in the Seal Cat and Tigers The vestigial fold is more distinct in Man than in any animal which I have hitherto examined in the recent state but it is readily seen in the Monkey Dog and Cat Almost invariably the right azygos persists whilst the lower intercostal veins of the left side instead of forming a left azygos venous trunk unite into an azygos minor which joins the right azygos Variations in the extent of the azygos and azy gos minor constitute subordinate peculiarities In the Cetaceall the remarkable condition is found of total absence of the right azygos as well as of the left azygos vein Peculiarities of the coronary vein and sinus in certain animalsIn the Ornitho rhynchus in which animal the left superior cava joins the inferior cava immediately before its termination in the right auricle the coronary vein is said to open directly into the auricle by a separate orifice to the right of the inferior caval It seems not improbable that in this case the vein in question is rather a

ANTERIOR VEINS IN MAN The different conditions of the great anterior veins in the Mammalia having been classified according to their progressively increasing deviation from the common ver tebrate type an attempt may be made in analysing the varieties of these vessels met with in Man to retrace the series from forms presenting the most complex metamor phosis to such as manifest no fundamental change whatever In this series the ordinary condition of the veins is included as the most frequent actual variety The formation of the cross branch at the root of the neck being regarded as the initial step in the metamorphosis of this portion of the human as of the mammalian venous system the varieties of these veins in Man may be divided into two classes according to the presence or absence of this transverse branch The occurrence in one or another degree or the entire failure of the subsequent stage of the metamorphosis viz the occlusion of one of the lateral primitive veins suffices to distinguish thefirst class of varieties into three groups corresponding with those already indicated as the regular conditions in different Mamnmalia A In the first group comprehending the normal condition in which the occlusion is of the greatest known extentt the persistent portion of the vein after metamorphosis con veys only the blood from the substance of the heart and forms a cardiac venous trunk B In the second it would also return the blood from its own side of the thorax and thus constitute an azygos venous trunk C In the third where no occlu sion occurs it transmits the blood fromt the whole of its own side of the upper part of the body and is then a second vena cava superior In all of these cases one of the lateral primitive veins is developed into the ordi nary vena cava superior and in most instances this is the vein of the right side whilst that of the left undergoes metamorphosis but the reverse of this nay happen as  REID Art Heart Cycl Anat and Phys p 597 t It has already been shown that complete occlusion of this primitive vein i e from the neck down to its entrance in the right auricle does not as RATHKE supposed occur in the ordinary condition even of the highest Mammalia or of Man nor has it yet been seen as an occasional variety That it ever does happen is scarcely probable for just as in the utmost known amount of abnormal obliteration of the inferior cava the hepatic veins always concur to form a short inferior trunk which opens into the right auricle so the confluence of the coronary and other cardiac veins may set a like limit to the occlusion of the left anterior primitive venous trunk Nevertheless it is possible that the process might extend to the closure of its lower end or coronary sinus also the blood from the substance of the heart then returning to the right auricle directly through en larged anterior or posterior cardiac veins or taking some altogether different course In a curious case re corded by LE CAT and hereafter to be particularly mentioned the auricular end of the left primitive vein seems really to have been closed though its channel continued pervious up to the neck MDCCCL X154 MR MARSHALL ON THE DEVELOPMENT when the viscera are transposed so that transposition as an additional cause of peculiarity may affect any of the preceding groups Lastly the three principal groups may present subordinate variations depending on peculiarities either in the upper vena cava itself or in the azygos veins or in the coronary vein of the heart In the second class of varieties in which no cross branch is formed in the neck both of the lateral primitive veins are necessarily persistent each carrying back the blood of its own side Such cases may also present peculiarities in the azygos system or may be complicated by transposition of the heart Though the records of the varieties in these great veins in the human subjec t do not as yet supply examples of every conceivable deviation and though the descrip tions of many are somewhat obscure or incomplete they appear to admit of arrange ment according to the scheme just mentioned CLASS I TRANSVERSE BRANCH IN THE NECK PRESENT Group A The second anterior venous trunk reduced to a cardiac venous trunk a Without transposition A right vena cava superior and a left cardiac venous trunk or coronary sinusThis is the ordinary condition of the great anterior veins It is accompanied by numberless subordinate modifications occurring either in the right superior cava itself or in the azygos systems or in the coronary vein of the heart and includes by far the greater number of the recorded varieties of these veins a Varieties in the Right Superior Vena Cava These appear to be very rare A presumed example is recorded by ROSENTHAL in which the auricles and ventricles being undivided two superior veins called two superior cave joined immediately before ending in the single auricle into which however they opened by separate mouths In this case the upper cava may have been shorter than usual so that the two superior veins were the venve innomninatae but the description is not sufficiently fullt b Varieties in the Right and Left Azygos Systems These are exceedingly numerous and require to be referred to several heads 1 The right intercostal system consolidated the left intercostal system broken up  Jn this the most frequent

through an azygos minor as in the usual case or if that vessel be wanting by independent intercostal branches or by both of these ways together or its lower branches may descend to the lumbar or renal veins Its upper portion forms a left superior intercostal vein The azygos vein in these cases formed towards its termination by the persistent trunk of the right cardinal vein usually ends in the upper vena cava the right canal of CUVIER but its place of termination is said though very rarely to be moved on as if by the fusion of the canal of CUVIER with the right auricle so that it may end in the auricle itself or even approach the neighbourhood of the inferior cava within the pericardium as occurs in some animals The right superior intercostal vein which is not formed by any part of the prim i tive venous trunks frequently joins the arch of the vena azygos itself jj but with out any other coexistent variation its place of opening may be removed to the upper vena cava 11 to the right innominate 11 or subelavian veins or even to the vertebral vein The left superior intercostal vein the trunk of which is generally formed by the metamorphosed portion of the primitive left jugular vein immediately below the transverse branch in the neck is when present almost constant in its mode of ter ruination ending at the underside of the commencement of the left innominate vein f 2 The right intercostal system retaining its integrity but unusually largeT here are various degrees of this condition in which the azygos vein besides receiving all the intercostal branches of its own side including the superior intercostals is joined by more than usual or even by all the separate branches of the left side In this latter case the ordinary left superior intercostal vein is very small or wanting the left primitive jugular trunk having become obliterated quite up to the cross branch in the neck as exemplified in the embryo Plate III fig 4 A still more remarkable enlargement of the azygos vein has been rather often met with in those cases in which the inferior cava being deficient the azygos conveys all the blood usually brought back by that vessel excepting what returns from the liver which continues to pass by a short hepatic venous trunk directly into the heart The  SOEMMERRING De Corporis Humani Fabrica vol v p 373 f BRESCCHET Recherches sur le Systeme Veineux Note p

azygos minor of nearly equal size ending in the cor responding superior intercostal veins r In other kinds of double azygos a right and a left vein coexist and becoming widened below discharge themselves in the lumbar or emulgent veins 4 The right intercostal system broken up the left more consolidatedIn this some what rare condition the trunk of the azygos vein is reduced to a very small vessel ending as usual in the superior cava but most of tile right intercostal veins pass over to the left side where they form a large left azygos ending above in the left innomi nate vein through the left superior intercostal 5 The right azygos vein entirely wantingIn all the preceding varieties of the intercostal system of veins with their intermediate gradations excepting  the vena azygos is still present though sometimes represented by a very small vessel The persistence of the right cardinal vein is therefore remarkably constant It is possible however to conceive this vessel to be entirely obliterated so that there should be no vein arching over the right bronchus to end in the upper cava No perfectly unexceptionable example of this condition has been recorded c Varieties in the Coronary Vein of the Heart As might almost be anticipated these are few and very rarely occur One instance is mentioned by MECKEL and one by JEFFRAY in which the coronary vein ends in the left

qui sans p6ntrer dans loreillette droite se jettoit dans la veine souclaviere gauche The course pursued by this single trunk froro the heart to the left subelavian vein is not described and anomalous as this remarkable case has hitherto appeared it is perhaps an example of the closure of the orifice of the left primitive vein in the right a uricle accompanied by a pervious condition of that vessel

of its extreme diminution or entire absence only occur with some other deviation T b With transposition The vena cava superior on the left side and a coronary sinus on the right sideWhen the arch of the aorta passes over the right bronchus the veins do not always suffer transposition also for in those cases in which the aorta regains the left side of the vertebral column as it descends the vena cava superior together with the azygos continues on the right side But in complete transposi tion of the viscera including the heart and great arteries the vena cava superior descends on the left side and the azygos vein is transposed to that side also 1 Here the metamorphosis by occlusion has affected the right primitive veins instead of the left and the heart itself being entirely transposed it is presumable that there would be found in a recent specimen a right cardiac venous trunk that is to say a coronary sinus on the right side receiving the great coronary vein together with an oblique auricular vein a vestigial fold and the other remnants of the occluded second primi tive venous trunk as in the usual case  Medmoires de IAcad des Sciences 1738 Hist p 44 This is a case already

complicated by subordi nate varieties as for example in the intercostal systems and it is interesting to find that one of the most remarkable of the deviations met with in the azygos vein when holding its customary position has been observed also in the transposed vein viz its excessive enlargement to enable it to return the blood from the lower half of the body in cases where the inferior cava is deficient and is represented only by the trunk of the hepatic veins Lastly the great anteiior veins do not appear ever to undergo transposition unless the heart itself be reversedt Group B The second anterior venous trunk an azygos venous trunk existing on the left side or by transposition on the rightThis condition which is regular in the Sheep Ox Goat Pig c has not as far as I know been met with as a deviation in the human subjects even in the most complex forms of transposition or malformation but it is here referred to as one that may possibly be yet detected In the cases hitherto recorded as examples of a left vena azygos in Man the un usual vein as already fully particularized pp 156 157 has ended in some of the branches or in the trunk of the vena cava superior A true left vena

receives all the branches of the inferior cava excepting the hepatic veins and turns over the left bronchus to end in the ordinary upper cava which however is on the left side t In an interesting case recorded by WILSON in the Philosophical Transactions a vena cava superior together with a perfect vena azygos is found on the left side only of the thorax This does not appear to have been an example of transposition of the right vein over to the left side but rather one in which the heart being reduced to a single auricle and a single ventricle and not transposed the ordinary right upper cava is entirely wanting whilst a true left upper cava alone exists pursuing as usual a circuitous course to the heart Philosophical Transactions 1798 p 346 with a plate A case of ectopia cordis The child

the blood from the outside of that sac and descended in the position of the oblique vein into the coronary sinus might be conceived to have been a true left azygos venous trunk formed by a persistent

right superior cava is smaller than usual being assisted by the additional vein on the left side This left upper cava generally smaller than the right one invariably descends over the aortic arch and afterwards in front of the root of the left lung beneath which it turns backwards and then runs along the base of the heart to reach the right auricle Nearly thirty examples of this condition are on

transverse branch but its existence cannot now be confidently asserted The azygos vein which is of ordinary size opens as high as usual in the right superior cava The middle cardiac vein opens directly into the auricle The coronary vein appears to be small There is no azygos visible on the left side The wide orifice of the left cava has on its upper and right border a narrow ridge but there

1808 p 21 This as already stated p 158 is described by LEMAIRE as an instance of the coronary vein ending in an unusual left pulmonary vein but on careful perusal of the description it appears more

No 15 WEESE op cit sect 45OF THE GREAT ANTERIOR VEINS 163 right auricle The transverse branch in the neck d is not half the size of either jugular vein It crosses over the commencement of the great arteries of the head and neck and opens into the lateral venous trunks somewhat below the point of junction of the jugular and subelavian veins of each side This circumstance ob served also in Professor SHARPEYS preparation is interesting when considered in re lation to the position of the cross branch in the embryo and to the mode of forma tion of the right innominate vein From opposite the left end of this cross branch the additional superior cava fv lo s descends upon the aorta to the front of the root of the left lung and crossing the corresponding vessels reaches the side of the left auricle immediately behind the appendix then turning backwards under the lowermost pulmonary vein in close contact with the auricle it runs obliquely inwards beneath the base of the heart along the auriculoventricular furrow and finally opens by a wide orifice into the right auricle to the left of and somewhat before the inferior cava i e in the ordinary situation of the orifice of the coronary sinus The azygos vein exists on the right side and on the left there is a small vein opening into the left cava about 11 inch below the cross branch and close above the root of the lung this small vein is a left azygos formed by the persistence of a part of the left cardinal vein it fulfils the office of the left superior intercostal vein The azygos and this small left azygos are also seen in Professor SHARPEYS preparation From the cross branch down to the root of the lung i e outside the pericardium the left cava is rather narrower than the right It is placed close beneath the pleura and supports upon its outer side the left phrenic nerve 14 It rests first upon the left carotid and subelavian arteries and then on the arch of the aorta The par vagumr 13 descends further back than the vein and gives off a branch which accompanies the vessel to the heart On a level with the upper border of the pulmonary artery the vein pierces the fibrous layer of the pericardium  1 1 1  t Within the pericardium as may be noticed in all the cases which have been fully described the left vena cava becomes very much dilated As it passes from the left pulmonary artery to the root of the subjacent pulmonary vein it is lodged v in a tubelike fold of the serous membrane the analogue of the vestigial fold On the side and back of the left auricle I o and afterwards along the course of the auriculo ventricular groove s the vessel is everywhere covered and bound down by the serous layer of the pericardium and has muscular walls In turning horizontally to the right it receives the coronary vein g which appears small and courses rather over the left border of the ventricle than comes from between the ventricle and the auricle Further on a posterior p and then the middle m cardiac vein enter it from below The large vessel itself o occupies the place of the short oblique vein usually found on the back of the left auricle The lower dilated part of the left vena cava superior s occupying the place of the Coro nary sinus is distinctly muscular its fibres for the most part being circular and ap164 MR MARSHALL ON THE DEVELOPMENT parently blending with those of both auricles There are no valves along its course but the mouth of each of its cardiac branches is guarded with a fine valve that of the coronary vein being the largest The wide orifice of the vessel into the right auricle is marked above below and to the right by a slight rim but there is no Thebesian valve the absence of which in this and all the other examples of double vena cava superior in which the point is capable of being determined Nos 1 4 12 30 31 suggests a comparison with the fact that it is also absent in those large quadru peds which have a left vena cava superior or a left azygos venous trunk The Eusta chian valve is small and perforate its left cornu does not reach the lower border of the fossa ovalis owing as it were to the intervention of the large orifice of the left superior cava Theforamen ovale is quite closed The second example No 31 of double vena cava superior which I have to menu tion occurred in the heart of a child between four and five years of age in the ven tricular portion of which there are some defects The auricles however are perfectly shut off from each other The lower part only of the left superior cava is present in the preparation that vessel having been divided opposite the left pulmonary veins it is very large and muscular and receives the coronary and one other principal cardiac vein the orifices of both being provided with valves The opening of the vessel into the auricle is marked by a sharp border but as in other cases the Thebesian valve is wanting So too is the Eustachian valve b With transpositionT here is so far as I am aware but one instance on record of the occurrence of double vena cava superior together with transposition of the viscera In this case the superadded vein is of course on the lighlt side a small vena azygos exists on that side and ends in the right vena cava CLASS II TRANSVERSE BRANCH WANTING A failure in the preliminary step of the development of a cross branch in the neck necessarily implies the nonocclusion of either of the lateral primitive veins for though two superior cave may coexist with the transverse communication in the neck yet when the latter is absent each primitive vein must continue to return the blood from its own side of the upper half of the body In such instances the characteristic cross branch of the mammalian venous system is wanting the condition of the great anterior veins is like that of birds and there is no metamorphosis excepting what is due to changes of size and position in the four simple lateral primitive veins typical of the vertebrate animal Transposition has not been noticed in connection with this variety The best illustration of deficiency of the cross branch occurs in a case No 2t  Sir A COOPER in Dr WATSONS paper Medical

to the jugular veins there was no appearance whatever of a transverse branch across the neck Besides this the case is interesting as affording a distinct example of the presence of both azygos veins

is to appear The dotted lines in figs I and 3 indicate the outline of the liver which has been removed Fig 4 Embryo 11ths of an inch long The jugular veins elongated and begin lning to approach each other opposite the place of the future transverse branch which could not be traced quite across the neck The cardinal veins are smaller owing to the wasting of the Wolffian bodies Fig 5 Heart of an

The left cardinal vein is still further reduced in size but no occlusion has yet taken place Fig 8 Embryo I inch and Aths long In this embryo and in embryo fig 10 most part of the left lung has been cut away The lower part of the left primitive jugu lar extending from below the cross branch to the junction of the left cardinal vein and left canal of CUviER is occluded and a fine opake cord o exists in its place The left cardinal vein and left Cuvierian canal now form the left vena azygos as in the adult the intrapericardial portion of which is seen to cross the left pulmonary vessels and is lodged in a fold of the serous membrane The cross branch now passes obliquely over to the right side and forms the left innominate vein which ends in the lower part of the right jugular now the vena cava superior Fig 9 Back of the heart of an embryo 14 inch long to show the differences in size length and direction between the right and left Cuvierian canals after the partial occlusion of the

also the succeeding part of the left Cavierian canal the lower end of which however remains pervious as a little conical pouch c on the back of the left auricle A fine cord c occupies the place of the occluded vessel The left cardinal vein has disappeared The cross branch now oblique in direction forms the left innominate vein d which ends in the vena cava superior h Fig 5 Embryo Ilo5 ths of an

reduced in size and forms the trunk of the left superior intercostal vein i the succeeding portion is occluded and forms a fine semitransparent cord which is continuous through the pericardiurn with the occluded part of the left canal of CUVIER C This latter lies in a fold of the serous membrane in front of the left pulmonary vessels and descends on the back of the left auricle to the conical pouch c above mentioned The left cardinal vein b in fig 6 relatively very much diminished in size appears to form a branch of the left superior intercostal vein PLATE IV Several views of the hearts of

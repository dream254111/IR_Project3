ANOTHER V WOOD AND OTHERS Supreme Court of Appeals At Richmond January 15 1903 1 REGISTRYAcknowledgments by grantor before trustee A trustee in a deed of trust cannot as an officer take the acknowledgment of the grantor in such deed for the purpose of its registration A recordation of a deed upon such an acknowledgment will not give constructive notice of the deed The deed is good between the parties but void as to creditors and subsequent pur chasers for value and without notice 2 VENDORS LIEN Implied lien Express 3ecurity Invalidity of express lien Where prior to 1850 a vendor of real estate took a deed of trust to secure the purchase price he cannot rely on the implied vendors lien then recognized although the deed of trust is void as to subsequent purchasers for want of due registry This rule applies to judicial sales as well as to sales between private individuals 3 REGISTRY Vendor and vendee It is not necessary as between vendor and vendee and those claiming under the latter to record a deed in order to pass the legal title 4 REGISTRY Unrecorded trustdeedPurchaser at judicial sale Purchasers at a judicial sale are entitled to the same protection against an unrecorded deed of trust as a purchaser from a private individual 5 PURCHASERUnrecorded lienNoticeBad faith Notice to affect a subsequent purchaser for value from one who holds title subject to a lien upon property may be inferred from circumstances as well as proved by direct evidence but the proof must be such as to affect the conscience of the purchaser and be so strong and clear as to fix upon him the imputation of bad faith Appeal from a decree of the Circuit Court of Culpeper county pronounced at its November term 1899 in a chancery suit therein pending under the style of Green v Smith and Others wherein a petition was filed by the appellants to which the appellees were made defendants Affirmed The opinion states the case Eppa Hunton Jr and Thomas Smith for the appellants G D Gray and Barbour  Rixey for the appellees CARDWELL J delivered the opinion of the court This case is the sequel of the case of Bell v Wood 94 Va 677 In November 1842 George Ficklin purchased of John T Green  Reported by M P Burks State Reporter730 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb and two others commissioners of the Circuit Superior Court of Culpeper county in the suit of Green against Smith a lot of land known as the Coach Factory Lot situatedin the town of Cul peper and gave his three bonds for the unpaid purchase money each for 33333 with one Hill as his surety dated the day of the sale and payable in one two and three years with interest from their date The commissioners pursuant to the decree under which they acted conveyed the property to Ficklin in which deed Mrs E H Smith the wife of William Smith the owner of the property united so as to convey a title exempt from her contingent right of dower and Ficklin reconveyed the property to one Fayette Mauzy of Culpeper county in trust to secure the payment of his purchasemoney bonds which trust deed was acknowledged before and spread upon the records of the clerks office of Culpeper county by one F Mauzy county clerk October 23 1843 The decree under which Ficklin purchased directed the commissioners of sale to make to the purchaser a deed to the property and take from him a deed of trust on it to secure the purchase money The commis sioners of sale reported that they had sold the coach factory lot to Ficklin that they had conveyed it to him and had taken the deed of trust above referred to to secure the purchase money evidenced by his bonds and the court ratified the action of the commissioners and confirmed their report The deed to Ficklin from the commis sioners does not appear to have been recorded in the clerks office of Culpeper county but the trust deed from him to Fayette Mauzy trustee refers to it as having been duly executed Ficklin died in 1852 and soon thereafter in the suit of Coons and wife against Ficklin instituted for the settlement of his estate several lots of land among others the coach factory lot subdivided into smaller lots the lots now in question were sold at public auction by one Hill the executor of Ficklin acting as commissioner of the court to make the sale and were purchased by Brown Wood and Rixey These sales were confirmed by the court the purchase money paid and the lots purchased were conveyed to the respective purchasers by a commissioner of the court appointed for the purpose and by successive alienation these lots have come to the present owners appellees here The appellants are seeking to collect a large balance alleged to be due and unpaid on the Ficklin bonds above mentioned and to that end to subject the lots of land now in the possession of appellees1903 HUNTON V WOOD 731 who claim to be purchasers for value without notice of any lien in favor of appellants They set up other defenses but in the view we take of the case it is only necessary for us to consider the ques tion whether or not appellees are purchasers without notice of the lien asserted by appellants First appellants claim the right to subject the property in ques tion to the payment of their debt by virtue of the deed of trust from George Ficklin to Fayette Mauzy trustee while appellees contend that this deed was never properly acknowledged or admitted to record and that although it may actually have been spread upon the records it is void as to them The ground upon which appellees rest their contention is that Fayette Mauzy the trustee and grantee in the deed and F Mauzy county clerk who certifies the acknowledgment of George Ficklin the grantor and admitted the deed to record was one and the same person When the case was here upon the former appeal Bell v Wood supra it was said in the opinion It cannot be assumed that an officer has been guilty of improper conduct in the discharge of a duty incident to his office though such a fact may be shown by proof when put in issue This issue was made up when the case went back to the circuit court and upon the proof taken it appears that Fayette Wt Latham is the executor of Fayette Mauzy and as such is a party to the suit of Coons and wife against Ficklin etc and that in the petition filed by him and appellants in that suit to enforce the payment of the debt here asserted it is alleged that said Fayette Mauzy was the trustee in the deed in question George D Gray a resident of Culpeper county all his life a practitioner of law of hight standing and for a number of years attorney for the commonwealth in that county testifies that Fayette Mauzy was the clerk of the county court of Culpeper county from 1839 to 1852 that he always signed his name as F Mauzy that the deed of trust was aelinowledged in 1843 during the time that MIauzy was clerk that he witness knew Fayette Mauzy from the year 1840 to his death in 1852 that he was trustee in many deeds and frequently as clerk took the acknowledgment of the grantor in the deed to himself as the records in the office will show that he witness was well acquainted with the people of the county and during the time from 1843 to the death of Fayette Alauzy there732 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb was no other Fayette Mauzy or F Mauzy known to him in the county of Culpeper From this uncontradicted proof there can be no sort of doubt that Fayette Mauzy trustee in the deed from George Ficklin and F Mauzy county clerk who took and certified the acknowledgment of the grantor were one and the same person It was ably argued however that although it might be true that F Mauzy county clerk who took the acknowledgment and Fayette Mauzy the grantee in the deed were one and the same person yet as the act of taking the acknowledgment was but a ministerial act it ought not to invalidate the recordation of the deed and in support of this contention a number of wellreasoned decisions by courts of other States are cited but as this question is no longer an open one in Virginia it having been expressly decided adversely to appellants contention in Davis v Beazley 75 Va 491 since cited by this court in a number of cases we deem it unnecessary to review the decisions of other courts relied on by appellants In Davis v Beazley supra it was held that a grantee in a deed or a beneficiary under it is not allowed as an officer to take an acknowl edgment of the deed by the grantor with the view to its registration The certificate of such acknowledgment is invalid as authlority to admit the deed to record and hence a recordation based upon it is without effect as notice by construction under the registry laws that such a deed is good between the parties and if not duly ad mitted to record is void only as to creditors and subsequent pur chasers Section 2465 Code This statute is practically the same with reference to registry of contracts deeds etc touching the sale and conveyance of property that was in force when the trust deed in question here was taken and spread upon the records of the county court of Culpeper county in 1843 It not being denied that appellees are purchasers for value the trust deed under which appellants claim a lien upon their property is unquestionably void as to them It is true as appellants further contend that at the time of this transactionthat is at the time of the sale of the coach factory lot to George Ficklin in 1842the commonlaw implied vendors lien was in existence it not having been abolished until 1850 and it could be enforced against a purchaser for value with notice either actual or constructive but even as between the parties vendors1903 HUNTON V WOOD 733 and vendees it might be waived by taking other securities or a security of different form In Redford v Gibson 12 Leigh 343 the opinion by Allen J says This lien implied vendors lien is however a creature of a court of equity founded upon the supposed intention of the parties and whenever from the circumstances of the case it appears that the parties did not contemplate such a lien it will not be established There is strong reason in our country where all the incumbrances are required to be recorded not to extend this secret equitable lien beyond the principles already established The records are universally looked to as disclosing all charges upon the property Prudence dictates the propriety in all cases of re taining an express lien where the legal title is parted with If the vendor instead of adopting this course chooses to rely on his secret equitable lien he should be cautious not to do anything leading to the inference that no such lien was intended to be retained As we have seen the commissioners of the sale in Green against Smith were clothed with full authority to convey the coach factory lot to George Ficklin to take from him a deed of trust thereon to secure the unpaid purchase money and having exercised this power and authority their action was ratified and confirmed by the court The deed of trust taken being valid as between the parties thereto could only operate as constructive notice to purchasers from Ficklin from its recordation as required by the registry laws or from the tine that such purchasers had actual notice of it Therefore an express lien having been taken to secure the purchase money due from Ficklin void as to subsequent purchasers from him or his alienees by reason of the failure to record the same as required by the registry laws appellants cannot be permitted to set up the implied vendors lien as security for the payment of the claim they now assert Without a recordation of this trust deed or actual notice of it the purchasers at the judicial sale of the property in Coons and wife against Ficklin took such title as George Ficklin might have conveyed in his lifetime which would have been a mere equity of redemption had the trust deed been duly recorded but a valid legal title free from the incumbrance of the deed of trust it not having been duly recorded The recordation of Ficklins deed was not necessary to invest him with the legal title It gave him no greater or higher estate by having it recorded and as be tween him and his vendee he could have passed all he had whether734 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb his title was recorded or not free from the incumbrance of the un recorded trust deed and such was the effect of the conveyance from the commissioners of sale to Brown Wood and Rixey from whom appellees derive title There is no pretense in the record that appellees or those from whom they derive title had actual notice of the claim asserted by appellants As was said in Floyd v lar din 28 Gratt 401 It is no hardship on parties claiming the right to subject property under a deed of trust to the payment of money due them to have their deed duly and properly spread upon the records of the county so as to affect other people desiring to pur chase such property with notice thereof However much courts of equity may incline to resort to every just and proper means to enforce the payment of purchase moneg due for property there are others whose rights are equally to be considered and whose claims upon the conscience of the chancellor are equally as strong and cogent as those that are made by vendors who are seeking to enforce payment of their purchase money and they are those who can say that they have in good faith bought the property which is the subjectmatter of litigation paid their pur chase money therefor and are in no default Purchasers at a judicial sale are entitled to the same protection against an unrecorded trust deed as a purchaser from a private in dividual The statute makes no distinction 16 Am  Eng Enc Law 831 Zollman v Moore 21 Gratt 325 So a purchaser of equitable title is protected against an unrecorded trust deed Pres tons Admr v Nash 76 Va 1 It is true that notice sufficient to effect a subsequent purchaser from one who holds title subject to a lien upon property may be inferred froin circumstances as well as proved by direct evidence but the proof must be such as to affect the conscience of the pur chaser and must be so strong and clear as to fix upon him the imputation of mala fides As stated by Mr Minor 2 Minor Inst 887 The effect of the notice which will charge a subsequent purchaser for valuable consideration and exclude him from the protection of the registry law is to attach to the subsequent pur chaser guilt of fraud It is therefore never to be presumed but must be proved and proved clearly A mere suspicion of notice even though it be a strong suspicion will not suffice See also Vest v Michie 31 Gratt 149 Mills Co v Strough 98 Va 721 Fischer v Lee 98 Va 1631903 HUNTON V WOOD 735 In this case not only is there no proof whatever of such facts and circumstances as would warrant the inference of notice to appellees sufficient to affect their conscience but in fact it appears that in a petition filed in the case of Coons and wife against Ficklin by a commisioner of the court in Green against Smith then charged with the collection of the very debt that is now here asserted and in which he sought to be substituted to the rights of others who had received the purchase money from the sale of property be longing to George Ficklin in the firstnamed case and refeerring to the lots now owned by appellees this statement is made Said lots have long since passed into the hands of innocent third fourth or fifth parties who have teen bona fide purchasers and it would he inequitable to proceed against them now for said purchase money as your petitioner would be obliged to do if the said debts should not be paid in full in this suit This petition was not filed until 1886 at the March term of the court and but a few years after the first effort was made to collect the George Ficklin bond even against Ficklins estate or his surety on said bond and if the holders of the lots in question were then to be regarded as innocent purchasers for value without notice they remain so sinee there is no proof in the record to the contrary We are of opinion that the decree of the circuit court denying the right of appellants to subject these lots to the claim they assert and dismissing their petition is plainly right and it is therefore affirmed Affirmed NOTEThe principles of law announced in the foregoing opinion seem satisfac tory enough but we find some difficulty in accepting the conclusion reached The facts briefly stated were that land sold at a judicial sale was under directions of the decree of sale conveyed by commissioners to the purchaser and the latter recon veyed the same to a trustee in trust to secure the purchase money The deed of conveyance was not recorded and the deed of trust admitted to record on im proper certification was not legally recorded The property subsequently passed into the hands of grantees for value who had no actual notice of the deed of trust Under these circumstances the court holds that the deed of trust is void for non registry and the purchasers take title free from any claim for the original purchase money It is conceded that if the subsequent grantees are not charged with actual or constructive notice of the deed of trust the ruling is correctand it is clear that no notice is to be imputed by the improper registry But does not notice result from another source It is an elementary principle that one is charged with notice of the contents of every instrument constituting a link in his chain of title He cannot claim through an instrument and yet dis736 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb claim notice of what appears on its face Authority need scarcely be cited for the proposition See Am note to LeNeve v LeNeve 2 L C E 168169 Jameson v Rixey 94 Va 342 The latter case is strikingly similar to the principal case There in a partition suit a decree for owelty of partition was entered infavor of one of the cotenants The other cotenant subsequently sold her parcel to a pur chaser who had no actual notice of the lien for owelty The court held the late Judge Riely delivering the opinion that as the purchaser necessarily relied upon the decree of partition as part of his muniments of title he must be charged with notice of the lien therein mentioned  The partition suit was the very source of title to the particular parcel of land involved in this controversy It was the in trumentality by which the undivided interest of Mrs Gibson in the tract of land devised to her    was segregated and defined    The8e records if inspected could but have brought home to the purchaser of the land knowledge of the lien charged thereon for owelty of partition It is the duty of the purchaser to look to the title papers under which he buys If he close his eyes to the sources of information he does so at his peril Applying this principle to the case at bar Ficklins title rested solely on the proceedings in the chancery suit under which he became a purchaser The decrees appointing commissioners to sell and confirming the sale and directing a conveyance were essential links in his chain of title and in that of all purchasers claiming under him One or more of these decrees necessarily authorized and re quired the deed of trust in question An inspection of these decrees would have led to the discovery that Ficklins title was subject to a lien for the purchase money Such inspection it was clearly the duty of purchasers to make The improperly registered deed of trust was void only as to purchasers without notice These purchasers were not without notice The nonregistry therefore was imma terial as to them The same principle was enforced opinion by Judge Keith in Roanoke Brick etc Co v Simmons 20 S E 955 where a purchaser was held charged with an unrecorded deed of trust by the mere words  save as to the deed of trust aforesaid  appearing in the covenants of warranty contained in the conveyance under which the purchasers grantor claimed

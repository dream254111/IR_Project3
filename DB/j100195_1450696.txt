j100195,The Jewish Quarterly Review,1450696,Fragment of an Aramaic Text of the Testament of Levi,i263163,THE TESTAMENT OF LEVI FRAGMENT OF AN ARAMAIC TEXT OF THE TESTAMENT OF LEVI THE question of the authorship and date of the Testa ments of the Twelve Patriarchs has been much discussed of late years and the opinions of recent scholars have constantly tended to assign to it a Jewish origin and a preChristian date This view already held by Grabe was discredited for a time but was again strongly advocated by Schnappl whose conclusions were greatly strengthened by the arguments of Kohler 2 and Conybeare 3 expressed in their articles which appeared in the JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW and with these scholars Schiirer4 in the latest edition of his history appears to agree It is hoped that the publication of the annexed fragment of a hitherto unknown Aramaic Text may throw some light on the problem The MS from which our text is taken is one of the many treasures which are contained in the Schechter Taylor collection of MSS brought by Prof Schechter from the Cairo Genizah in 1896 and now in the University Library at Cambridge5 we owe it to the kindness of these gentlemen that we are enabled to give this fragment to the public The fragment consists of one complete leaf and attaching to it a very small portion of a second leaf of a twocolumn vellum MS written in an Oriental hand which can scarcely be later than the eleventh century The leaf is ten inches square and is in some places so severely mutilated as to be Die Testamente der ZwoilfPatriarchen 2  The PreTalmudic Haggada J Q R vol V pp 400406 3 t On the Jewish Authorship of the Testament of the Twelve Patri archs ibid pp 375398 4 Gesch Juid Volk 3rd edit vol III p 257 5 It was my good fortune to discover the MS in February lastH L P 651THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW entirely illegible The nature of the fold in the vellum leads to the belief that the very small fragment is part of a page which occurred earlier in the original MS than the complete leaf though it may or may not have imme liately preceded it Each column consists of twentythree lines and there is no punctuation of any kind the beginning of a new paragraph being indicated by a small lacuna which in one instance fol 2a col i 1 i6 is misplaced The discovery of the Armenian Version has placed it beyond doubt that the author of our Greek Text handled his material with considerable freedom both omitting from adding to and remoulding the original text It was therefore to be expected that the Aramaic Text should show some con siderable divergence from the Greek and this will be seen to be the case although their verbal identity in many places is an almost certain testimony to their common origin To facilitate the necessary comparison we have printed by the side of the Aramaic such passages of the Greek Text as were identical with or strongly reminiscent of it In so doing we have been obliged at times to change the order of the Greek and to omit that part of it which found no place in the Aramaic We have therefore appended in its integrity the Greek Text of chapters II 3 which is the portion of the Testament covered by the Aramaic 1 So much for the treatment of that part of the MS contained in the complete leaf with regard to that part which is contained in the very small portion that remains of the second leaf we can say little and have been able to find no direct parallel in the Greek from such words however as are legible it would appear that we have here a portion of the biographical section of the Testament and that the Patriarch is describing the events narrated in Gen xxxiv fol i a if we have deciphered it correctly containing the invitation to circumcision Gen xxxiv 22 and fol ib describing the subsequent I The Greek Text which we have in all cases followed is that of Dr Sinker Testamentum XII Patriarcharum Cambridge I869 652THE TESTAMENT OF LEVI plundering of the town Gen xxxiv 2729 a passage somewhat similar to the latter occurs in the Testament of Judah chap v where the siege of a town is being described Besides the Armenian Slavonic and Greek Texts to gether with the versions made from the latter there exist two Semitic fragments of the Testaments The first is the Testament of Naphtali in Hebrewl the second a very short extract from the Testament of Levi in Syriac2 which by a strange coincidence covers a small portion of the Aramaic Text now published and is almost verbally iden tical with it It occurs in a Brit Mus MS Add 17193 dated A D 874 which contains 125 short miscellaneous extracts of which it is No 80 it is given in full by Prof Wright in his Catalogue from which we reproduce it 3 H LEONARD PASS J ARENDZEN PS Since the above was in print there appeared on May 29 the second number of Dr Preuschens Zeitschrift fur die neutestarnentliche Wissenschaft und die Kunde dles Urchristentums containing two articles on the Testa ments of the Twelve Patriarchs the first by the editor Die armenische Uebersetzung der Testamente ler zwolf Patriarchen the second by W Bousset Die Testamente der zvwolf Patriarchen The former article contains a German translation of the Armenian version of the Testament of Levi in two recensions The latter attempts to reconstruct the original text auf Grund der Textzeugen Various points raised in these articles together with some others in recent literature on the Testaments we hope to discuss in their bearing on our firagment in a future number of the J Q R t Published with introduction critical apparatus and translation by

be called to the different types of variation indicated by the plants illustrated Briefly these may be summarized as follows 1 Dwarfing The Mills Boston fern is a very good illustration being less than a third the size of the normal Boston fern also the dwarf holly fern Cyrtomum falcatum Rochfordianum compactum 2 Ruffling Several of the varieties illustrated show ruffling Mandas polypodium the Siebold pteris the holly fern and the Riverton pteris all show considerable ruffling of the pinnae together with the irregular lobing of the margins which always seems to accompany this character An additional point is the fact that ruffled ferns are usually less fertile than the planeleaved types 3 Variegation The presence of a white stripe down the middle of the pinnae is shown in several of the pteris varieties illustrated P cretica albolineata P cretica Alexandrae P ensiformis Victoriae P cretica Mayi P quadriaurita argyraea It occurs also in a Polystichum P aristatum which is a common trade fern 4 Cresting This is one of the commonest types of variation in wild as well as in cultivated ferns As it appears in cultivated varieties it seems to be a perman ent characteristic repeated in the spore progeny Among wild plants it sometimes seems that cresting merely affects a single leaf or two occasionally 5 Division The best illustration of variation in division among the plants figured is shown by the Verona variety of Boston fern This is a common occurrence however both among cultivated ferns and to a less extent among the wild forms A distinct twice 93AMERICAN FERN JOURNAL divided Christmas fern form has been found more than once Fern Bull July 1907 and October 1909 6 Sterility Reference has already been made to the fact that ruffled varieties are generally less fertile than the normal types Apparently also sterility may some times appear to be the only distinction between the normal form and the new type The Boston fern as compared with the wild sword fern its ancestor differs mainly in the fact that it produces no fertile spores To be certain of sterility it is necessary to make a careful examination under the microscope of the contents of often apparently fertile sori 7 Spiral Twisting A single form of Boston fern with leaves curiously twisted in irregular spiral fashion is under cultivation As many as seven complete rotations have been noted in a single leaf In another Nephrolepis form the twisting takes a form which causes the pinnae to stand out at all points of the compass instead of being arranged in two rows extending in opposite directions 8 Determinate Growth Among Boston ferns and in fact in the genus Nephrolepis in general it is a rare thing to find the tip of the leaf completely unrolled Dr Small reports the wild species of Florida reaching lengths of over twenty feet primarily due to indeter minate growth Two or three varieties of Boston fern however have shown the ability to complete the leaf tip 9 Vivipary A recent horticultural form of Boston fern has added the ability of the leaves to produce new bud plants to the other characteristics of the genus So far as I know no other form or species of Nephro lepis is able to bear buds on the leaf 10 Apospory Investigators of some of the cultivated forms of unusual sports of Dryopteris have reported that occasionally new prothallia may be produced directly from the margin of a normal leaf that is leaving out the necessity of development of prothallia from spores 94VARIATION IN FERNS It has always seemed to me possible that some of our native species of Dryopteris may be found to do the lame thing especially some of the hybrid types which have no fertile spores but which form large clumps in a favorable location It would be extremely worth while for members of the Fern Society to bear in mind the possibilities of variation which have been detected already partly among wild forms but especially in cultivated types as indicated above For example there is every reason to expect that eventually a variegated form of some of the common wild species will turn up In general variegation re presents a loss of vigor for the plant so that such a plant would then need to be transplanted to a garden where it could receive careful attention Mr Weatherby has written outlining five types of Christmas ferns which he has seen Classified according to the list of variations they represent namely 1 The normal form 2A crested form 3Theruffled type 4A twicepinnate type 5Another division form not distinctly twicepinnate I should be very glad to receive plants of any distinct forms of Christmas ferns which members may find or if whole plants are not available to receive fertile leaves which show the varia tion In view of the fact that the cultivated variety of the sword fern specifically the Boston fern has been found to give rise to so many and unusual new varieties it will be interesting to make a thorough study of the dagger fern Polystichum acrostichoides with its similar leaf cutting to see whether it may not also be in the process of variation and potential evolution of new forms Of Mr Weatherbys list of five forms I have found four a most distinctly ruffled type a completely twice pinnate type and the twice pinnatifid form together with the normal Is not the common sensitive fern an illustration of ruffling fixed in a wild species 95AMERICAN FERN JOURNAL Mr Waters writes in a recent letter In collecting for my herbarium I always got as many different forms of a species as possible Forking fronds interested me but not as much as normal ones showing intangible and indescribable variations in leaf cutting In this connection it may be added that in the Boston fern series of varieties occur forms distinguished by reflexed pinnae by blunt tips by different colored stipes and rachides by different shaped bases of the pinnae by the brittleness of the leaf stalks et al Such differ ences remain constantly distinguishable

the time of Phidias colossal statues wheni not of bronze were acroliths our criticism was lirected to tlie authors broad assertion which entirely ignorel the existence of o0ava WRITER OF TIlE NOTICE OF  HUAMAN PROPORTION Geology of Philadelphia Will Professor Henry Carvill Lewis state where the term hydromicaslate is ued by II D Rogers or in that portion of the report on Chester county writ ten by the undersigned The word occurs seven times in the Lancaster county report but in every case except the italics on p 10 which the reference on tlhe ninth lizne below shows to be a misprint it is usel in the sense de fined in my criticism and not as an equivalent for hydromicaschist As his defence of the use of the other terms alluded to does not meet the objections no further remark is necessary PERSIFOR FRAZEtR Sept 28 1883 The chinchbug in New York We have the chinchbug Blissus leucopterus Say in New York in formidable numbers Its appear ance with us is of great interest as hitherto tihe only record of its occurrence is that of Dr Fitch who several years ago saw three individuals of it upon willows in the spring I had never before met with it in our state Dr Harris you will remember mentions having seen one example in Massachusetts By some manner it has been introduced here and I can think of no way so probable as that it has been brought in a freightcar from the west The locality of its occurrence is in St Lawrence county the most western of our northern counties As it was for some time thouglht that the insect could not live north of 40 of latitude this seems a strange locality for its first appearance Its operations were first noticed in a field of timo thygrass last summer but the depredator was not then discovered This summer the infested area had largely extended and upon a more thorough search being made it was found in myriads could be scooped up it is stated by handfulsanmong the roots of the living grass bordering the killed area In the fields infested the timothy June and  wire grass  are completely killed so that they are suc ceeded the following season by thistles weeds and patches of clover So far it has not attacked wheat or corn of which however very little is grown in St Lawrence county I have just visited the infested locality and I find it to be a very serious attack It is rapidly extending to other than the two farms upon which it was ob served last year and it in all probability exists in many places where it has not yet been detected Great alarm is felt throughout tlhe district invaded as the timothygrass is the foundation of the grazing interests of that region Clover owing to the sever ity of the winters cannot be grown to any extent The most threatening feature of the attack is that it has continued to increase notwithstanding that this year and the preceding have both been unusu ally wet in northern New York Gardencrops were killed by the heavy and continued rains grass is ly ing in the meadows which could not be secured and so cold has the season been that fields of oats are still unharvested All writers lhave concurred in stat ing that the chinchbug could not endure cold and VOL II No 37 wet seasons and that heavy rains were invariably fatal to it It really seems as if the newcomer was destiined to be a permanent institution in the state Tlie farmers are aroused to the importance of do ing what they can to arrest and repel the invasion I have recommended that it be fought with tlat valu able insecticide keroseneoil emulsified and diluted andl if generally used the ensuing spring I have great faith in its proving efficient Office of the state entomologist Albany Oct 9 183 J A LINTNER Ziphius on the NewJersey coast A telegram was received at the Smithsonian institu tion on the 3d inst from the keeper of the lifesaving station at Barnegat City NJ announcing the strand ing of a large cetacean at that place Professor Baird immlediately despatched the writer and a prep arator from the museunm to take charge of the speci men On arriving at Barnegat City I immediately perceived that we had to do with an example of an aged female of an interesting ziphioid whale and when the skull was cut out it became evident that the anilmal was of the genus Ziphius The specimen measures 19 feet 4 inches in length and was appar ently of a light stonegray color darkest on the belly This disposition of color is unusual in cetaceans The species is probably Z cavisortris Mr Palmer and myself succeeded in making a plaster mould of half the exterior and in cutting out the complete skeleton Thie genus Ziphius has not I believe been hitherto recorded as occurring in the northwestern Atlantic FREDERICK W TRUE Curator of mammals U S national museum Oct 11 1833 THE DE LONG RECORDS1

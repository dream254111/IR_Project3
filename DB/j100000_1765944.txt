ought to be cremation would have been introduced then and there For in 1866 when some cholera immigrants had been buried on Wards Island an epi demic started almost immediately in the part of the city nearest to that burialground there in 93d Street and 3d Avenue the first case occurred This was certainly a fact to be taken into serious consideration No man interested in the health of his fellows will be content to say that this was only chance And if it is more than chance why then has it never been proposed to prevent the propagation of the disease by fire as other peoples have long been accustomed to do There are four rules by observing which we can absolutely prevent cholera from setting foot on this continent  1 Let the drinkingwater be perfectly isolated that is keep the cholera germs from the drinkingwater 2 Let the fceces and other discharges be disinfected with quicklime or common whitewash This is by the way what Professor Koch recommended to the Central Sanitary Board of Japan 3 Let the clothing be disinfected with dry heat 100 C and afterwards with steam 4 Finally let the cholera corpse be cremated instead of buried 4 King Street New York ACORNEATING BIRDS BY MORRIS GIBBS MD IN Michigan there are to my knowledge six species of birds which feed on acorns Of these the passengerpigeon and mourn ingdove swallow the acorn entire with its shell intact only re moving the cup or rough outside covering The whitebellied nuthatch occasionally hoards the acorns away and only draws on its store after some months and when the firm shelly cover ing readily gives away to its sharp prying bill The other three are the wellknown bluejay common crowblackbird and red headed woodpecker The methods employed by these birds in opening an acorn are so entirely different that a description may not be uninteresting to your readers Kalamazoo City is nestled in a valley which was once nearly filled with oak trees and large numbers of the burroak Quercus macrocarpa are still standing The acorns of these trees some times called overcup or mossycup are nearly ripe and are now falling and the birds which feed on them gather to satisfy their love for the nutritious kernels So far as I am able to learn the birds except in rare instances do not pick the acorns from the tree but have to content themselves with the fallen fruit Occa sionally one sees a bird attempting to pick an acorn but it is rarely a success as the twigs are small and do not accommodate the swaying bird well and moreover at this season of the year many acorns are still strongly attached The redhead deigning to descend to the ground seizes an acorn and flying with it in its bill to a spot where there is a small cavity in the dead portion of a trunk or to a crevice in the bark immediately begins to hammer it with its sharppointed bill In a couple of strokes it has removed the outer shell or cup and at once attacks the still greencolored shell which directly surrounds the meat The inside or shell proper quickly gives way usually nearly in halves and the woodpecker enjoys the kernel The red head rarely comes into the city and is never here continuously but at this season he is quite often seen and heard and I have thought that the acorns brought him The woodpeckers are as nearly strict insectfeeders as any birds we have unless an exception is made of the swifts and swallows yet here is an instance of a varied diet However the redhead is quickly satisfied in the acorn line and soon begins circling the trunk or more often limbs for his legitimate food I33 The blackbird confines himself to the ground in his efforts for acorn meats and I have yet to see him in a tree with one Walk ing up sedately to an acorn and making no effort to seize or con fine it it strikes savagely and almost aimlessly Its bill frequently glances and the splintered shell dances about until at last a huge piece of the kernel is dragged out after which the bird leaves for other quarters or begins on another acorn The jay swoops down with flaunting blue wings and seizing the largest acorn on the ground flies to the nearest convenient limb or onto the decayed ridgeboard of an adjacent building There firmly pressing the nut between his big black feet he hammers away with a vengeance and quickly tears off nearly half of the shell after which it proceeds to pick out the meat in small bits The cup is often left nearly perfect the jay never making an effort to secure the nut entire which he could easily do Walking under the oaks one can readily tell whether the wood peckers blackbirds or jays have been at work among the acorns by the appearance of the mutilated shellremains lying about Kalamazoo Michigan LETTERS TO THE EDITOR  Correspondents are requested to be as brief as possible

reason and intelligence others attribute all his acts to instinct As a help to elucidate this question I wish to present the readers of Science the following statement of facts based on long and close observation I have a horse now nineteen years old that I have owned thir teen years I have used him all this time almost every day har nessed to a buggy in going back and forth to my office He is very gentle goodnatured and kind and has never shown any vices Soon after I commenced using him I noticed that on Sun days whenever I drove him downtown he strongly insisted by pulling on the lines on going to the church where I had been in the habit of attending I watched this disposition constantly after that and on every Sunday since when driven out he has con tinued to do the same thing and if left to his own will invariably goes to the church and stops I thought it possible that he was guided by the ringing of the church bells and tested him by driving him downtown at all hours of the day before and after the ringing of the bells but the result was the same He invaria bly insisted on going to church on that day no matter how often I drove him downtown My office is one block west and one north of the church and a halfmile west of my residence In going to church I usually turn south one block east of the office but sometimes go around by the office where I usually drive him every morning and afternoon In going to my office he never offers to go to the church except on Sunday but on that day he invariably begins to turn south to the street leading to the church from fifty to a hundred feet before reaching the crossing and if not checked turns into the street and hurries to the church He has kept this up for at least twelve years He never does this on any other day than Sunday In bad weather or in good weather it is the same although at the office much of the time he has had stable protection from bad weather On weekdays he often in sists on going to the stable in bad weather but on Sunday even when I compel him to go by the way of the stable he pulls over to the opposite side of the street and hurries on to the church if permitted though he may have to stand out in the cold rain or snow Sometimes from one cause or another he has not been taken away from home from one to four weeks and I supposed that he would lose the run of time or at least show some hesitation and uncertainty but not so On the first Sunday after I drove him out he insisted as before on going to church He never offers to go SEPTEMBER 2 1892

j101022,Bulletin of the Cooper Ornithological Club,1360828,Echoes from an Outing A Memory of the Sierras,i259084,I8 BULLETIN OF THE COOPER ORNITHOLOGICAL CLUB Gunn Mr Stephens was the first to find it in the coast region of California in I883 or earlier I sent the specimen to Mr Stephens at Witch Creek San Diego Co for further reference and he generously contributed the following notes and re marks that the specimen appears to be in the normal male plumage Mr Stephens says All my notes and ref erences are at San Diego so I cannot give you as definite information as I would like to In a general way this species is more or less distributed over the brushcovered hillsides chenlisal of Southern California between iooo and 3000 feet altitude They appear in the latter part of March By the end of June the song ceases or nearly so As they are retiring in habit the song is the principal clue to their pres ence I cannot say just how late the species remains but I doubt many birds being here after the first of August perhaps none The farthest north I have seen this species is near Independence Inyo Co see Fishers Report on the Ornithology of the Death Valley Expedition The nest and eggs are of the usual Spizella character the nest is placed in low bushesin the thick chemisal and May is the principal nesting month I have seen small companies of fewer than a dozen birds in the migration but usually not more than one or two pairs inhabit any one hillside I do not consider the species common any where and there are large areas in southern California where it does not occur Echoes From An Outing A MEMORY OF THE SIERRAS N a bright morning in early June a trio of the Cooper Club con sisting of Mr Barlow Mr Carri ger and the deponent set out from Placerville the old Hangtown of blessed memory and took our way up over the old stage road toward the divide A pair of handsome bays re lieved us of physical exertion and the blistering heat of the lower valleys was tempered by the mountain altitudes Every breeze was redolent with the o dors of conifers while the broad sweeps of the mountain suburbs were a contin ual revelation of fresh and inspiring scenery Our attention is early and often called to the substantial pavement with which Nature has invested the highway and hills and to the superfluous materials left scattered about But even these un gentle reminders are not devoid of sen timent for was it not over these rocks that Horace Greeley made his flying record behind the relentless whip of Hank Monk The incident is dim in the shadow of more important events connected with the old highway but in the light of experience the solemn con viction remains that here the seeds of lingering dissolution were planted in the tangled viscera of the great journal ist Tradition tells us that over this trail came many of the Argonauts of 49 and bands of goldhunters who followed in succeeding years When the hidden treasures of the old Comstock were un folded to the world the old trail was converted into a chartered thoroughfare and carried the products and supplies of that historic mining camp No suburb an avenue on the continent could then rival it in value and mlagnitude of its traffic and old residents with watery eyes and faraway look still delight to tell of those halcyon years when the road was crowded with a moving pro cession of dusty mules and ponderous trains of flying stages and hurrying equipages and all the turmoil of con gested business to be found where gold is prevalent But the sentiment is all of the past When the heart of the great industry ceased to beat associated enterprises died for want of nourish ment A few lumberladen teams from an adjacent mill plod up and down in monotonous routine The wandering camper urges his weary mules toward the clear waters  It is proper to here mention that the locality whence Mr Welch gleaned the observations that have entered into his delightful reverie is Fyffe El Dorado Co Cal a point on the Lake Tahoe Road which has of late years become a favorite sojourning point for numerous members of the Cooper Club It is most interesting to note the impressions which are inspired in one who does not give his time wholly to the fascinations of ornithology while in the field as do imost of the workers who have visited Fyffe in the summer Mr Welchs keen and ready wit and generous good nature were pleasing features of the outing as one may judge who foUows through the sketch ED1BULLETIN OF THE COOPER ORNITHOLOGICAL CLUB and cool shades of Tahoe Specters of decay linger in the neglected garden and unpruned orchard and the old road side houses stare out upon the deserted reaches like crumbling monuments in a cemetery of industries long since dead As we ascend to higher altitudes the landscape

pines has served often as a lodge for ornithologists sojourning at Fyffe on the Lake Tahoe Road during the summer through spires of conifers reveal the se questered homes of ranchmen For more than half a century the gold hunter has been writing history in these hills and from the rude inscriptions graved with pick and shovel and drill may be read untold stories of Roaring Camp and tales of romance and pathos of hope and despair With eager eyes my enthusiastic friends search the wayside for an alien visitant Not an adjacent nest has es to reverence that we approach the grandest woodland in all the world As we enter into the solemn shade and listen to the eternal whisper of its foli age one is deeply reminded of that heritage of the supernatural which in the ancient dawn of intelligence peop led the solitudes with gods and phan toms Soon we arrive at our destination a little nook carved out of the forest that might have been torn from an eastern log9BULLETIN OF THE COOPER ORNITHOLOGICAL CLUB landscape A plain old roadhouse with adjacent outbuildings have sur vived in some degree the industrial paralysis A garden with rows of cult ivated vegetables and an orchard ex tending back to the woodland lend an air of homelike comfort to the sur roundings We miss the rustle of In dian corn and the yellow plumes of goldenrod but an old worm fence sur rounding the enclosure completes a rustic scene that would appeal to the memory of them who know aught of of eastern rural life Rustic simplicity prevails within An old dusty bar a relic of other days be fore which many a weary soul has re ceived spirituous consolation has been promoted to the dignity of postoffice A broad open fireplace hints of the evening blaze and the seductive pipe This is the place we long have sought And mourned because we found it not Here freedom is unconfined We may occupy three chairs at a time bunk on the postoffice skin birds on the table and smoke the room blue without provoking a questioning glance The flag of the Cooper Club is unfurled over Sportsmans Hall conventionality kicked out of the back door and free dom invited to shriek It is surprising how the appetite gains upon the clock but it is not yet the hour for luncheon and my col leagues have already assumed their nondescript costumes and vanished in the wilderness Conservation of energy is my distinguishing trait and for what little popularity I have attained among my fellowmen I am indebted to this virtue Therefore I light my pipe and saunter out to see what Nature may add to the rustic picture An old oak en bucket that hangs in a well of clear cold water tempts me to the verge of harmless intoxication and then I pause by a dripping trough where a band of small frogs are rehearsing for the evening entertainment Barn Swallows circle and twitter about the old barn wherein a noisy hen is pro claiming the accomplishment of a ma ternal duty A band of Lark Sparrows are ex ploring a barren pasture over the way while far up in the adjacent cedars a band of those mountain GypsiesBlue fronted Jaysare juggling bird lan guage in a most distracting manner A meadowlark perches himself on the old rail fence and utters his clear ring ing call like a bugler on parade while a robin in a neighboring apple tree be trays the proximity of its nest by dis tressing cries A pair of bluebirds have reared their brood in the cavity of a tall stub and now spend their time gos siping about the pasture with a band of purple finches A patch of dead black berry vines are investigated without result but in a growth of young coni fers by the orchard fence I can hear the whining plaint of the Spurred Towhee Upon nearer approach I hear the cry of tsit tsit tsit so common to many birds of divergent natures that it seems as if somewhere back in the his tory of bird evolution they had a com mon parentage and this the primal per haps only note of their vocabulary The alert black head of a Junco discloses the author of the cries and upon part ing the foliage a feeble flutter of baby wings reveals the cause of parental anxiety A Redshafted Flicker with his merry cheerup stops to explore a dead pine With the exception of the Redbreasted Sapsucker he seems the only representative of his kind for though this is a haunt of the Pileated and Cabanis Woodpeckers as well as of their smaller Whiteheaded cousin they are not often in evidence A number of goldfinches are flitting about the orchard but the hour for luncheon is at hand and one cannot spoon with Nature while suffering from the pangs of an unrequitted appetite Nature has not here shown her bold est handiwork in mountain sculpture or in arboreal creations for the pass is not the highest and the majestic shafts about us are but wands as compared to the giant sequoias of Calaveras and Mariposa Yet she has done enough to impress one most profoundly with the vastness of her conceptions Well it is that the government has sought to res cue this great aviary from the hands of the despoiler for the desecration of the axe and sawmill is in evidence on every side The results of our daily excursions among the warblers and IIOBULLETIN OF THE COOPER ORNITHOLOGICAL CLUB other birds of the deeper forests have been recorded by those veterans in birdcraft Messrs Barlow and Carriger and although every day was replete with pleasant incidents further refer ence to the subject would here be su perfluous Yet after the last days work is done I linger to bid goodbye to the pleasant associations and go out again into the lengthening shadows to witness the coming of the night Seated upon a fallen cedar with a mattress of brown needles at mv feet I examine the treas ures around me To the north a broad sweep of the lowlying valley untram melled by civilization rests languorous and dreamy in the purple haze while beyond rise the gray granite walls and battlements that mark the course of that erstwhile Klondikethe American River To the east the bald granite ridges sweep ever upward until the gleaming fangs of the great divide stand clear and cold against the evening sky On every side the silver stars of mountain misery look up from their beds of feathery foliage and groups of tiny figworts some robed in vestments of white and gold and others in im perial purple are scattered over the soft carpet Near them a snowy iris stands like a chaste nun guarding her worldly flock A dead cedar thrusts its tapering spire far up into the blue ether and on its pinnacle an Olive sided Flycatcher assumes his solitary watch uttering now and anon his pe culiar note In adjacent thickets the warblers and vireos are completing their evening repast and their gentle gossip falls on the evening stillness like baby prattle of birdland The low happy notes of the Chickadee are heard from every side while from the slant ing branch of a spruce a grosbeak lifts up its voice in anthem so earnest and joyous that its influence is infectious The dawn of night is around us swiftfooted and silently she treads the lower valleys and her cool balmy breath permeates the forest The clam orous birds are hushed in her mysteri ous presence She pauses a little in her upward flight while the lingering sun throws a parting kiss to the eastern hills which blush responsive to the greeting The silence that invokes the children of imagination is over the landscape and the peace which pass eth all understanding seems to enfold the hills The groves were Gods first temples is a sentiment written on every hill and whispered in every wan dering breeze What simplicity is here where the whole world may come un questioned and leave its burdens in Gods own sanctuary What glorious absence of narrow creeds of pompous caste and petty cliques and all the empty formalities of fashionable de votions No gloved and perfumed usher with scrutinizing glance suggest ive of credentials No salaried choir to taint the holy anthems with stains oi commerce and no tenthousanddollar exponent of humility to throw bouquets of empty rhetoric No ostentatious ap peals to God to manifest His divine presence are ntecessary He is here if anywhere and you know it These are His temples and His silent sermons are written on every side More masterful than the creations of men are these majestic columns and eternal naves More beautiful than the frescoes of St Peter are these cloud swept vaults and glorious vistas The grandest symphonies of the masters are not more acceptable to the human heart than the sweet anthems of the birds borne upon the deep solemn strains of these mighty windharps No one who exercises thought can pass a twilight in the impressive solemnity of these groves without imbibing in some degree the sentiment which im pelled that broadminded teacher of humanity and humility of mercy and charity to go alone into the solitudes to pray The day is nearly spent and night moves silently while the evening star rises white over the spectral hills The weird call of a creeper is still heard like the mocking taunt of some wood land sprite and as I move to go a faint twitter comes from out the snowy plumes of the deerbrush so soft so in effably sweet that it seems a benedic tion to Natures silent services The day is dead Night threw her sable mantle oer the world And pinned it witha star J M W

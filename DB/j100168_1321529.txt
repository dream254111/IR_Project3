of America comprise In order to answer this question intelligently it is necessary to ascertain the meaning of the term United States First  It is the collective name of the States which are united together by and under the Constitution of the United States and prior to the adoption of that Constitution and subsequently to the Declaration of Independence it was the collective name of the thir teen States which made that Declaration and which from the time of the adoption of the Articles of Confederation to that of the adop tion of the Constitution were united together by and under the former This moreover is the original natural and literal mean ing of the term Between the time of the first meeting of the Con tinental Congress and that of the Declaration of Independence the term United Colonies came into general use2 and upon in T The following article was already planned and in part written when the writer first learned of Mr Randolphs intention to furnish an article on the same general sub ject for the January number of this Review While therefore the writer desires to acknowledge the material assistance which he has derived from Mr Randolphs article he entirely disclaims any intention to answer it or to criticise it 2 It first occurs in the Journal of the Continental Congress under date of June 7 1775 vol I ed of I777 p II4 Resolved that Thursday the 20th of July next be observed throughout the twelve United Colonies as a day of humiliation fasting and prayer and from that time to the date of the Declaration of Independence its use is very frequent It occurs three times in the commission issued to Washington as commanderinchief p I22 six times in the articles of war pp 133 137 138 I39 140 and twice in the Declaration of the United Colonies of North America under date of July 6 1775 setting forth the causes and necessity of their taking up arms366 HAR A RD LA W REVIEW dependence being declared as the thirteen colonies became the thirteen States the term was of course changed to United States In the Declaration of Independence both terms are used W hen the Articles of Confederation were framed United States of America was declared to be the name and style of the confedera tion created by those articles2 This however had no other effect than to confirm the existing practice and to increase the use of the term in the sense which it had already acquired and accordingly during the whole period of the Confederation United States meant the same as the thirteen United States and the primary reason for using either term was to save the necessity of enumerating the thirteen States by name Indeed the Articles of Confederation were merely an agreement between the thirteen States in their corporate capacity or more correctly an agreement by each of the thirteen States with all the others There were therefore thirteen parties to the confederation and no more and the people of the different States as individuals had directly no relations with it Accordingly it was the States in their corporate capacity that voted in the Continental Congress and not the individual members of the Congress and hence the voting power of a State did not at all depend upon the number of its dele gates in Congress and in fact each State was left to determine for itself within certain limits how many delegates it would send3 Hence also each State had the same voting power4 Even the style of the Continental Congress was The United States in pp 143 145 Sometimes the number of United Colonies was specified and some times it was not The colony of Georgia did not unite with the other twelve and so was not represented by delegates in Congress until the thirteenth of September 1775 p I97 Prior to that date therefore the term used was either the United Colonies or the twelve United Colonies while after that date it was either the United Colonies or the thirteen United Colonies While this term was making its way to the front it had a competitor which was even earlier in the field in the term Continent or Continental which was also much used during the war of the Revolution Perhaps an attentive study of the Jour nal of Congress would show that Continent or Continental was not precisely synonymous with United Colonies or United States but it certainly was very nearly so 1 4 United Colonies is used once namely in the concluding paragraph and United States is used twice namely in the title and in the concluding paragraph 2 Art i 3 By the fifth article of Confederation no State was to be represented by less than two delegates nor by more than seven 4 Namely each State had one vote Fifth Article of ConfederationTHE STATUS OF OUR NEW TERRITORIES 367 Congress assembled not as the present style would suggest The Delegates of the United States in Congress assembled and if the style had been  The Thirteen United States in Congress assembled the meaning would have been precisely the same Evidence to the same effect as to the sense in which the term United States was used prior to the time of the adoption of the Constitution is furnished by the treaties made during the period of the Confederation Thus the Treaty of Alliance made with France February 6 I778 begins 1 The Most Christian King and the United States of North America namely New Hampshire etc enumerating the thirteen States So the Treaty of Amity and Commerce made with France the same day begins2 The Most Christian King and the thirteen United States of North America New Hampshire etc So the Treaty of Amity and Commerce made with Holland October 8 I782 begins  Their High Mightinesses the StatesGeneral of the United Netherlands and the United States of America namely New Hampshire etc So the Treaty of Amity and Commerce made with Sweden April 3 I783 begins The King of Sweden and the thirteen United States of North America namely New Hampshire etc Lastly the Definitive Treaty of Peace with England September 3 I783 by which our independence was established after a recital pro ceeds thus  Art i His Britannic Majesty acknowledges the said United States namely New Hampshire c to be free sove reign and independent States that he treats with them as such and relinquishes all claims to the government propriety and territorial rights With the adoption of the Constitution there came a great change for the Constitution was not an agreement but a law  a law too superior to all other laws coming as it did from the ulti mate source of all laws namely the people and being expressly declared by them to be the supreme law of the land6 At the same time however it neither destroyed nor consolidated the States nor even affected their integrity and though it was estab lished by the people of the United States yet it was not estab lished by them as one people nor was its establishment a single act but on the contrary its establishment in each State was the act of 1 8 U S Stats 6 2 Page 12 3 Page 32 4 Page 6o P Page 8o 0 Art 6 sect 2368 HARVARD LAW REVIEW the people of that State and if the people of any State had finauy refused to ratify and adopt it the consequence would have been that that State would have ceased to be one of the United States Indeed the Constitution and the Articles of Confederation differ from each other in respect to the source of their authority in one particular only namely that while the former proceeded from the people of each State the latter proceeded from the Legislature of each State In respect to their effect and operation also the two instruments differ from each other in one particular only namely that while the Articles of Confederation merely imposed an obli gation upon each State in its corporate and sovereign capacity in favor of the twelve other States the Constitution binds as a law not each State but all persons and property in each State These differences moreover fundamental and important as they un doubtedly are do not nor does either of them at all affect either the meaning or the use of the term United States and there fore the conclusion is that the meaning which that term had the day after Independence was declared it still retains and that this is its natural and literal meaning Regarded then as simply the collective name of all the States do the United States comprise territory Directly they certainly do not indirectly they do comprise the territory of the fortyfive States and no more That they comprise this territory only indi rectly appears f om the fact that such territory will always be iden tical with the territory of all the States in the aggregate  will increase as that increases and diminish as that diminishes Secondly  Since the adoption of the Constitution the term United States has been the name of a sovereign and that sove reign occupies a position analogous to ti at of the personal sove reigns of most European countries Indeed the analogy between them is closer at least in one respect than at first sight appears for a natural person who is also a sovereign has two personalities one natural the other artificial and legal and it is the latter that is sovereign It is as true therefore of England for example as it is of this country that her sovereign is an artificial and legal per son i e a body politic and corporate and therefore never dies The difference between the two sovereigns is that while the former consists of a single person the latter consists of many persons each of whom is a member of the body politic In short while the former is as corporation sole the latter is a corporation aggregateTHE STATUS OF OUR NEW TERRITORIES 369 Who then are those persons of whom the United States as a body politic consists and who constitute its members Clearly they must be either the States in their corporate capacity i e artificial and legal persons or the citizens of all the States in the aggregate and it is not difficult to see that they are the former Indeed the latter do not form a political unit for any purpose The citizens of each State form the body politic of that State and the States form the body politic of the United States The latter therefore consisted at first of the original thirteen States just as the Confederation did but as often as a new State was admitted a new member was received into the body politic  which there fore now consists of fortyfive members It will be seen there fore that while the United States in its second sense signifies the body politic created by the Constitution in its first sense it signi fies the members of that body politic in the aggregate A conse quence is that while in its first sense the term United States is always plural in its second sense it is in strictness always singular The State of New York furnishes a good illustration of the two senses in which the term  United States is used under the Constitution for the style of that State as a body politic is The People of the State of New York and the members of that body politic are the citizens of the State The term people therefore in that State means first all the citizens of the State in the aggre gate i e the members of the body politic and secondly the body politic itself and while in the former sense it is plural in the latter sense it is singular The term United States is used in its second sense whenever it is used for the purpose of expressing legal or political relations between the United States and the particular States or between the former and foreign sovereigns or states or legal relations between the former and private persons while it is used in its first and original sense whenever it is desired to designate the particular States collectively either as such or as members of the body politic of the United States It is also used in that sense when ever it is used to designate the territory of all the States in the aggregate As a substitute for the term United States when used in its second sense the term Union is often employed The original difference between United States and Union was that while the former was concrete the latter was abstract and hence it is370 HARVARD LAW REVIEW that the latter cannot be substituted for the former when used in its original sense When used in its second sense it is plain that the term United States has no reference to extent of territory either directly or in directly Regarded as a body politic the United States may and does own territory and may be and is a sovereign over territory but to speak of its constituting or comprising territory would be no less absurd than to predicate the same thing of a personal sovereign though the absurdity would be less obvious Thirdly  Since the treaty with England of September 3 I783 the term United States has often been used to designate all terri tory over which the sovereignty of the United States extended The occasion for so using the term could not of course arise until the United States acquired the sovereignty over territory outside the limits of any State and they first acquired such territory by the treaty just referred to For although as has been said that treaty was made with each of the thirteen States yet in fixing the boundaries the thirteen States were treated as constituting one country England not being interested in the question how that country should be divided among the several States Moreover the boundaries established by the treaty embraced a considerable amount of territory in the Northwest to which no State had any separate claim and which therefore belonged to the United States and the territory thus acquired was enlarged from time to time by cessions from different States until at length it embraced the entire region within the limits of the treaty and west of Penn sylvania Virginia North Carolina and Georgia as the western boundaries of those States were afterwards established with the exception of the territory now constituting the State of Kentucky Then followed in succession the acquisitions from France Spain Texas and Mexico Out of all the territory thus acquired twenty eight great States have been from time to time carved and yet there has never been a time since the date of the treaty before referred to when the United States had not a considerable amount of terri tory outside the limits of any State I The term Union is used three times in the Constitution namely in Art i sect 8 subsect 15 Congress shall have power to provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union suppress insurrections and repel invasions in Art 2 sect 3 the President shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the Union c and in Art 4 sect 3 subsect i new States may be admitted by the Congress into this UnionTHE STA TlS OF OUR NEW TERRITORIES 371 It is plain therefore that for one hundred and fifteen years there has been more or less need of some word or term by which to des ignate as well the Territories of the United States as the States themselves and such word or term ought moreover to have been one signifying directly not territory but sovereignty sovereignty being the only thing that can be predicated alike of States and Ter ritories The same need was long since felt by England as well as by other European countries and the word empire was adopted to satisfy it and perhaps we should have adopted the same word if we had felt the need of a new word or term more strongly Two peculiarities have however hitherto characterized the terri tory held by the United States outside the limits of any State first such territory has been virtually a wilderness secondly it has been looked upon merely as material out of which new States were to be carved just as soon as there was sufficient popu lation to warrant the taking of such a step and hence the need of a single term which would embrace territories as well as States has not been greatly felt At all events no such new term has been adopted and hence  United States is the only term we have had to designate collectively either the States alone or the States and Territories and accordingly while it has always been used for the former of these two purposes it has also frequently been used for the latter It is very importarnt however to understand that the use of the term  United States to designate all territory over which the United States is sovereign is like the similar use of the word empire in England and other European countries purely con ventional and that it has therefore no legal or constitutional significance Indeed this use of the term has no connection whatever with the Constitution of the United States and the occa sion for it would have been precisely the same if the Articles of Con federation had remained in force to the present day assuming that in other respects our history had been what it has been The conclusion therefore is that while the term United States has three meanings only the first and second of these are known to the Constitution and that is equivalent to saying that the Con stitution of the United States as such does not extend beyond the limits of the States which are united by and under it  a proposition the truth of which will it is believed be placed beyond doubt by an examination of the instances in which the term United States is used in the Constitution372 HARVARD LAW REVIEW Its use first occurs in the preamble1 in which it is used twice The first time it is plainly used in its original sense i e as the col lective name of the States which should adopt it If the words had been We the people of the thirteen 2 United States respec tively the sense in which United States was used would have been precisely the same Nor is there any doubt that it is used in the same sense at the end of the preamble Of course there is a very strong presumption that when a constitution is made by a sovereign people it is made exclusively for the country inhabited by that people and exclusively for that people regarded as a body politic and so having perpetual succession and the same thing is true mutatis mutcandis of a constitution made by the people of several sovereign States united together for that purpose The preamble however does not leave it to presumption to determine for what regions of country and what people the Constitution of the United States was made for it expressly declares that its purposes and objects are first to form a more perfect union i e among the thirteen States or as many of them as shall adopt it Then follow four other objects which though in terms indefinite as to their territorial scope are by clear implication limited to the same States 3 and lastly its purpose and object are We the People of the United States in order to form a more perfect Union es tablish justice insure domestic tranquillity provide for the common defence promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our posterity do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America 2 To have stated the number of States in the preamble would however have been inconvenient because it was uncertain when the Constitution was framed how many States would adopt it It was provided by Art 7 that as soon as it was adopted by nine States it should become binding upon the States adopting it nine being within a fraction of threefourths of the whole and the assent of nine States having been required by the Articles of Confederation for the doing of all acts of prime importance See Art g last paragraph but one and Arts io and ii In fact only eleven States partici pated in the first election of Washington as President and only that number was rep resented in Congress during the first session of the first Congress 3 Moreover the usage of the times furnishes positive proof that the terms com mon defence and general welfare were used in the preamble with exclusive refer ence to the thirteen States for the words common and general were familiarly used to distinguish what concerned the United States from what concerned the several States as such and that too at a time when United States could not possibly mean anything else than the thirteen United States Thus the 3d Article of Confedera tion provides as follows The said States hereby severally enter into a firm league of friendship with each other for their common defence the security of their liberties and their mutual and general welfare So also the 5th Article contains the follow ing For the more conivenient management of the general interest of the United States delegates shall De annually appointed    to meet in Congress So also inTHE STATUS OF OUR NEW TERRITORIES 373 declared to be to secure the blessings of liberty to the people by whom it is ordained and established and their successors for though the word used is posterity it is clearly not used with literal accuracy but in the sense of successors According to the preamble there fore the Constitution is limited to the thirteen States which were united under the Articles of Confederation and it is by virtue of Art 4 sect 3 subsect i and in spite of the preamble that new States have been admitted upon an equal footing with the original thirteen In the phrases Congress of the United States 2 Senate of the United States 3 President

which the term United States is used in the Constitu tion had no existence prior to the time of the adoption of the Constitution it follows that whenever the Articles of Confederation use the term in

Congress of the United States In most cases however in which the term United States in its second sense or the term Congress or Congress of the United States would be used in the Con stitution the phrase United States in Congress assembled is used in the Articles of Confederation That phrase occurs in those articles a great number of times and whenever it occurs United States is used in its original sense This is clearly brought out by the following words in Art 5 Each State shall maintain its own delegates in any meeting of the States also by the following words in Art iO the voice of

general welfare of the United States 1 it seems to be used in its first or original sense especially as common defence and general welfare are taken from the preamble2 Certainly there is no pretence for saying it is used in its third sense In the phrase throughout the United States 3 there is believed to be no doubt that it is used in its original sense4 though it may be claimed that it is used in its third sense5 That it is used in its original sense in one instance is certain 6 and when the same phrase is used in different parts of the Constitution a strong presumption arises that it is always used in the same sense In the phrase resident within the United States 7 there can be no doubt that United States is used in its original sense the meaning being the same as if the words had been resident in one or more of the United States The phrase one of the United States affords a good instance of the use of United States in its original sense8 In the phrase shall not receive any other emolument from the United States or any of them 9 it is certain that United States is used in its second sense though it is also certain that the draughts man supposed he was using it in its original sense10 1 Art i sect 8 subsect i 2 See supra page 372 and notes i and 3 3 Art i sect 8 subsects i and 4 Art 2 sect i subsect 3 4 It has been seen supra p 365 n 2 that the first time the term United Col onies occurs in the Journal of Congress it is in the phrase thrbughout the twelve United Colonies The phrase throughout the United States is also used in two instances in the gth Article of Confederation the United States in Congress assem bled shall have the sole and exclusive right and power of fixing the standard of weights and measures throughout the United States    establishing or regulating Post Offices from one State to another throughout all the United States in neither of which can it possibly have any other meaning than throughout the thirteen United States Can any reason then be given for supposing that the authors of the Constitu tion attached a wholly different meaning to the same phrase namely throughout all the territory within the sovereignty of the United States It is believed that there cannot and yet the question depends entirely upon intention For the reader should bear in mind the fact that while the term United States may have its second mean ing in the Constitution though it was previously used in the same phrase with its original meaning and that too without any change of intention it cannot in the Constitution or elsewhere have its third meaning in a phrase in which it had previously had its first meaning without a corresponding change of intention See infra page 38I 6 Art 2 sect I subsect 4 The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors and the day on which they shall give their votes which day shall be the same throughout the United States  7 Art 2 sect i subsect 5 8 Art 2 sect I subsect 7 9 iith Amendment 10 At page 374 note I2 will be found an extract from the 4th Article of Confedera376 HARVARD LAW REVIEW In the phrase all persons born or naturalized in the United States  it seems clear that United States is used in its original sense for first it is either used in that sense or in its third sense and as the latter is not a constitutional or legal sense there is a presumption that the term is not used in that sense in an amend ment of the Constitution secondly it is declared that the same persons shall be citizens of the State in which they reside and this shows that the authors of the amendment contemplated only States for if they had contemplated Territories as well they certainly would have said citizens of the State or Territory in which they reside thirdly the whole of the I4th Amendment had reference exclusively to the then late war and was designed to secure its results  in particular to secure to persons of African descent certain political rights and to take from the States respectively in which they might reside the power to deprive them of those rights Moreover the amendment consists mainly of prohibitions and these are all with a single exception which need not be mentioned aimed exclusively against the States It was no part of the object of the amendment to restrain the power of Congress which its authors did not distrust and hence there was no practical reason for extending its operation to Territories in which all the power resided in Congress What is the true meaning of United States in the phrase under consideration is certainly a question of great moment for on its answer depends the question whether all persons hereafter born in any of our recently acquired islands will be by birth citizens of the United States The foregoing comprise all the instances but one in which the term United States is used either in the original Constitution tion in which occurs the phrase the United States or either of them and also an extract from the 6th Article in which occurs the phrase the United States or any of them and while these phrases are perfectly correct where they stand yet a transfer to the Constitution of the passages containing them would have made the same phrases incorrect as such transfer would have changed the meaning of United States On the other hand a transfer to the Constitution of an extract in the same note from Art 9 containing the same phrase would it seems have caused no change in the meaning of United States and hence the phrase in question would have been cor rect notwithstanding such transfer I1I4th Amendment sect i All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States nor shall any State de prive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the lawsTHE STATUS OF OUR NEW TERRITORIES 377 or in any of its amendments The other instance is found in the I3th Amendment in which United States is plainly used in its original sense if the words which follow it are to have any meaning and yet if the authors of that amendment had under stood that the term United States when used in the Constitution to express extent of territory had its third meaning they would have omitted the words or any place subject to their jurisdiction If a broader view be taken of the Constitution and its amend ments it will be found that the only portions of it which indicate the slightest intention to extend their operation beyond the limits of the States are the clause authorizing the admission of new States2 the clause providing for the government of territories3 and the I3th Amendment The Constitution of the United States like other constitutions is mainly occupied with the creation and organization of the three great departments of government the legislative the ex ecutive and the judicial Accordingly the first three articles comprising about sixsevenths of the whole are entirely occupied with these three departments respectively The last three sections of Art i namely the 8th gth and ioth Sections are however peculiar to the Constitution of the United States as a federal con stitution and will therefore be excluded from view for the present Of the remainder of Art i and of the whole of Arts 2 and 3 it may be affirmed that not one word in either has any reference or any application to any territory outside the limits of the States As to Arts i and 2 the correctness of this view has never been questioned and as to Art 3 its correctness is established by the uniform practice of the legislative department 4 of the govern 1 Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted shall exist within the United States or any place subject to their jurisdiction 2 See supra page 370 note i 3 Art 4 sect 3 subsect 2 4 For example the entire judicial power in the Territories has always been vested by Congress in one set of courts regardless of the dual system which exists in all the States by virtue of Art 3 of the Constitution Moreover these courts have always been termed Territorial courts not United States courts and have always been so re garded the statutes by which they have been created and governed are wholly separate and distinct from those creating and governing the courts of the United States within the States their judges have generally held office only for a term of four years whereas all judges appointed under Art 3 of the Constitution hold office during good behavior and originally there was no appeal from any Territorial court to the Supreme Court378 HARVARD LAW REVIEW ment and by a uniform course of decisions in the judicial department A distinction must however be made between those articles of the Constitution by which the several departments of the govern ment were respectively created and organized and those depart ments themselves for the reasoning which is applicable to the former is not necessarily applicable to the latter nor is the same reasoning necessarily applicable to all of the latter It does not follow because a department of the government is created and organized by the Constitution with reference solely to a given ter ritory that therefore the power of that department and its sphere of action are limited to that territory It may or may not be true and it may be true of one department and not true of another department In fact it is true of the judicial department but it is not true of either the legislative or the executive department How is it then that one of these three departments can differ so materially from the other two when no such difference is indicated by the Constitution which created and organized them all It is because the difference depends not upon the Constitution but upon the nature of the departments themselves The legislative anmd executive departments are sovereign in their nature and there fore their power and sphere of action are coextensive with the sovereignty of the United States of which sovereignty they con stitute the vital part  of which in fact they constitute all that has been delegated It is by them alone that the sovereignty of the United States can without changing or overthrowing the pres ent Constitution either speak or act i e either declare its will or execute that will when declared The judicial department on the other hand is not the depositary of any portion of the sov ereign power its function is simply to judge it cannot even enforce its own judgments without the support of both the legis lative and executive departments it could have no existence other than theoretical since the latter alone can appoint judges and the former alone can provide them with salaries It is true that the judicial department sometimes disregards what the legislative de partment has declared to be the sovereign will but that is not because of the nature of the judicial office  it is rather in spite I Sere v Pitot 6 Cr 332 Am Ins Co v Canter I Pet 5II Benner vr Porter 9 How 235 Clinton v Englebrecht 13 Wall 434 Reynolds v U S 98 U S 45 The City of Panama IoI U S 453

ment but because the judicial department has held that it cannot do otherwise than disregard an act of the legislative department which is in violation of the Constitution without itself incurring the guilt of violating the Constitution and also it may be added because the legislative department and the people have acquiesced in that view While therefore the power of the legislative and executive de partments is coextensive with the sovereignty the judicial depart ment can exercise only such jurisdiction as has been delegated to it and hence its jurisdiction would still be limited to the original thirteen States had not the Constitution provided for the admission of new States There is therefore no room for any question as to where either the legislative the executive or the judicial power in our new ter ritories resides for the legislative power clearly resides in the Congress of the United States and the executive power in the President of the United States and the power of establishing the judicial department also resides in Congress though Congress cannot itself exercise the power belonging to that department In the legislative and executive departments therefore is vested all the sovereign power in our new territories that has been delegated by the people and the real question is in what character and sub ject to what limitations if any do they hold this power Does Con gress for example hold the legislative power there as it does in the States i e subject to all the limitations and restrictions imposed by the Constitution or does it hold that power in the new terri tories without any other limitation than that imposed by the I3th Amendment namely that it shall not establish slavery in any of them or does the truth lie somewhere between these two extremes And this brings us to the question whether the limita tions and restrictions imposed upon Congress by the Constitution are operative outside the States These limitations and restrictions are found chiefly in the 8th and gth sections of Art i and in the first ten Amendments The 8th Section of Art i owes its existence entirely to the fact that the Constitution of the United States while it is a true consti tution and creates a true sovereign is yet a federal constitution By it the people of each State vested a portion of the sovereignty380 HARVARD LAW REVIEW of that State in the new sovereign created by the Constitution i e they made a partition of the sovereignty of the State between the State and the United States and the 8th section of Art i contains that partition The mode of making it was by granting to the new sovereign those branches of sovereignty which are enumerated in the respective subsections of Section 8 That section therefore so far as regards its main object and scope can have no application to any territory beyond the limits of the several States for no partition was to be made of the sovereignty over any such territory A strong presumption therefore arises that no part of the section was intended to extend beyond the limits of the States as it cannot be supposed that any incidental objects were in tended to have a more extensive operation than the main object What were the incidental objects of the section One was to provide security that the United States in exercising those branches of sovereignty which had been granted to it should treat all the States alike for if no such security were provided a majority of States might at any time combine to oppress a minority Accordingly subsection i having granted to Congress the power to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and excises it is added but all duties imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States So also subsection 4 grants to Congress the power to establish an uniform rule of naturaliza tion and uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies through out the United States Reasons have already been given for believing that the term United States in both these sub sections is used in its original sense and we now find another argument in favor of the same view in the scope and object of Section 8 As it would be absurd to hold that the grant of power in these subsections had any reference to territories as distin guished from States since Congress has full legislative powers in the territories without any grant from the States so it would be absurd to hold that the limitation of the power has a more exten sive operation than the power itself Moreover if all other argu ments fail it is at least true that those subsections contain nothing whatever to overthrow the presumption in favor of their being limited in their operation to the States There is a dictumn by Chief Justice Marshall in Loughborough v Blake which is opposed to the view insisted upon in this article L 5 Wheat 3I7THE STATUS OF OUR NEW TERRITORIES 38I It is however only a dictum as the learned Chief Justice himself admits The circumstances of the case were these Jan 9 I8I5 Congress passed an Act  laying an annual direct tax of 6ocoooo upon the United States which sum it proceeded to apportion among the eighteen then existing States Feb 27 i8I5 Congress passed another Act2 which in effect extended the first Act to the District of Columbia The plaintiff having refused to pay his share of the tax imposed upon the District by the second Act claiming that the Act was unconstitutional his property was seized and he brought trespass against the officer making the seizure The plaintiffs claim admitted of a very short answer namely that by Art i of the Constitution Section 8 subsection I7 Congress had all the power within the District that it had in any State plus the power of the legislature of that State and therefore had an unqualified power of taxation Still the Chief Justice thought it desirable for what reason is not very apparent to show that Con gress also had the power to impose the tax under the same grants of power by which it was authorized to pass the first Act Accord ingly he said first the power given to Congress to lay and col lect taxes was in terms without limitation as to place secondly the power to lay and collect taxes had the same extent as to place as the power to lay and collect duties imposts and excises thirdly the latter power was required to be exercised uniformly tk oughout the United States and it could not be so exer cised unless it extended throughout the United States and this brought him to the question what was meant by United States in the phrase throughout the United States Does this term said he3 designate the whole or any particular portion of the American Empire Certainly this question can admit of but one answer It is the name given to our great republic which is composed of States and Territories The District of Colum bia or the territory west of the Missouri is not less within the United States than Maryland or Pennsylvania If this dic turm be taken as simply giving one of the meanings of the term United States and without reference to the Constitution its cor rectness cannot be questioned but it seems not to have occurred to its learned author that while the meaning which he attributed to the term was one of its meanings it had other meanings also 1 C 21 3 Stats I64 2 C 60 3 Stats 2I6 7 5 Wheat 319382 HARVARD LAW REVIEW that it had been used in another sense in the first 1 of the two Acts of Congress which gave rise to the litigation in question and that his argument therefore required him to show that the mean ing which he attributed to the term rather than one of the others was its true meaning in the clause of the Constitution upon which he was commenting Perhaps it will not be thought unreasonable to place against the dictum in question the dictum of Webster in another case2 also decided by Chief Justice Marshall It is true that he was arguing for a client but then it was not his habit even as counsel to state propositions of law which he did not believe to be true and the truth of which he was not prepared to maintain He said  What is Florida It is no part of the United States How can it be How is it represented Do the laws of the United States reach Florida Not unless by particular provisions The Terri tory and all within it are to be governed by the acquiring power except where there are reservations by the treaty    Florida was to be governed by Congress as she thought proper What has Congress done  She might have done anything  she might have refused a trial by jury and refused a legislature    Does the law establishing the court at Key West come within the re strictions of the Constitution of the United States If the Con stitution does not extend over this territory the law cannot be inconsistent with the national Constitution It may be added that the decision was in Websters favor that not a word was said by the Chief Justice in disapproval of the passage just quoted that Loughborough v Blake was not cited either by counsel or judge that it has seldom been cited by any member of the court by which it was decided and that the dictum under consideration has it is believed never been so cited One other observation may be made upon Loughborough v Blake namely that the District of Columbia differs materially from a Territory that the former is within the limits of a State was once a part of a State and therefore the Constitution once 1 Which enacts sect i that a direct tax of 6oooooo be and is hereby annually laid upon the United States and the same shall be and is hereby apportioned to the States respectively in manner following To the State of New Hampshire I9358674 etc enumerating the eighteen then existing States Plainly therefore  United States is here used in its original sense 2 Am Ins Co v Canter i Pet 5II 3 I Pet 538THE STA TUS OF OUR NEW TERRITORIES 383 extended over it and it may not be easy to show that it has ever ceased to extend over it The object of the gth Section of Art i is to prohibit Congress from doing certain things which it would otherwise have had the power to do under the several grants in the 8th section Its object was therefore the same as that of the limitations contained in Section 8 and hence it would be as irrational to give Section 9 a more extensive operation in respect to territory than Section 8 has as it would be to give to the limitations upon the power of Congress imposed by Section 8 upon the grants contained in that section a more extensive operation than the grants themselves have An examination of the different subsections of Section 9 other than subsection i which having ceased to be operative may be passed over will lead to the same conclusion Thus subsection 2 provides that the writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended except under special circumstances subsection 3 that no bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed subsection 4 that all capitation or other direct taxes which shall be laid shall be apportioned among the States according to the respective num bers of their inhabitants i e shall neither be laid upon property without reference to State lines nor apportioned among the States according to their property 1 subsection 5 that no tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any State subsection 6 that no preference shall be given by any regulation of commerce or revenue to the ports of one State over those of another and that no vessel bound to or from one State shall be obliged to enter clear or pay duties in another subsection 7 that no money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law and a regular statement and account of the receipts and expenditures of all public money shall be published from time to time and subsection 8 that no title of nobility shall be granted by the United States and that no person holding any office of trust or profit under them shall accept of any present emolument office or title from any King Prince or foreign State Of these seven subsections no one discloses any intention to make it operative over a greater extent of territory than any of the others and it must therefore be assumed that the intention was 1 By Article 8 of the Confederation the amount of money required by Congress to be raised from time to time was to be apportioned among the States according to the aggregate value of the land in the States respectively exclusive of crown lands384 HARVARD LAW REVIEW in that respect the same as to all and hence it follows that they must all receive the same construction in respect to the extent of territory over which they shall be operative at least so far as their construction in that respect depends upon intention Moreover subsections 5 and 6 show conclusively upon their face that they are to be operative only within the States and subsection 4 shows the same intention with sufficient clearness Subsection 4 has also the same raison dtre as the limitations in subsections i and 4 of Section 8 i e it was designed to secure a minority of wealthy States against the risk of having the whole burden of government thrown upon them by the less wealthy majority and therefore it is absurd to suppose that it was intended to be operative in terri tories  which were never to have any voice in Congress and as to which therefore no such precaution was necessary Subsection 8 of Section 9 is more doubtful as to the territorial extent of its operation than any other part of the Constitution  not because of any intention that can be justly attributed to its authors but because of the language in which it happens to be couched Thus it provides in effect that no title of nobility shall ever be granted by the United States as a sovereign and that no person holding office under the sovereignty of the United States shall accept any present etc Fortunately however this subsec tion is of little importance and any doubt that may exist as to its true construction as it arises from accident can have no influence upon the construction of other parts of the Constitution In respect to the first ten Amendments of the Constitution it seems scarcely necessary to say more than to refer briefly to the circumstances under which they were adopted They were pro posed by the first Congress and at its first session and were a concession to the party which had opposed the adoption of the Con stitution and which had thus far prevented its ratification by two of the States namely Rhode Island and North Carolina Some of the States also which had ratified it had done so only because they had been induced to believe that it would be amended at the earliest opportunity In respect to the nature and objects of the amendments adopted it may be said that they are in the nature of a bill of rights i e they were designed still further to limit and restrict the powers of the new government under the grants contained in the first three articles of the Constitution and especially those contained in theTHE STA TUS OF OUR NEW TERRITORIES 385 8th section of Art I It would be very surprising therefore if they should disclose any intention to extend their operation be yond the limits of the States and in fact they do not disclose any such intention If any doubt exists as to the extent of territory over which any of them are operative it is only as to the ist Amendment and it arises not from any doubt as to the intention of its authors but from the same cause as in subsection 8 of Section 9 of Art i As to the remaining first ten Amendments the utmost that can be said against the view now urged is that the language in which they are couched is so broad and general as to make them susceptible of an indefinite extension in respect to ter ritory but that is far from being sufficient to overcome the pre sumption which exists in favor of their being limited to the States Moreover it is as true of the first ten Amendments as it is of the 9th Section of Art i that the intention of their authors was the same as to all of them so far as regards the extent of territory over which they were to be operative and yet it is certain that some of them are limited in their operation to the States Thus the 6th Amendment provides that all criminal trials shall be by a jury of the State and district in which the crime shall have been committed 2 and by district is here meant either an entire State or a subdivision of a State So the 7th Amendment perpetuates the right to trial by jury in commonlaw actions and declares that no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise reexamined in any court of the United States than according to the rules of the common law It is assumed therefore that the common law of England will be the law of the land in every place where this amendment will be operative More over the operation of the amendment is expressly limited to courts of the United States i e courts exercising some portion of the judicial power conferred upon the United States by Art 3 of the Constitution and it is only within the States as has been seen3 that such power can be exercised or such courts can exist Lastly the ioth Amendment provides that the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution i e in its first three articles nor prohibited by it to the States i e in Section io 1 Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibit ing the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances 2 U S v Dawson I5 How 467 3 See supra page 378386 HARVARD LAW REVIEW of Art i are reserved to the States respectively or to the people i e the people of the respective States and there could not well be a stronger proof that the sole object of the first ten amendments was to limit the power of the United States in and over the several States Nor should the fact be lost sight of that these ten amend ments as a whole are so peculiarly and so exclusively English that an immediate and compulsory application of them to ancient and thickly settled Spanish colonies would furnish as striking a proof of our unfitness to govern dependencies or to deal with alien races as our bitterest enemies could desire It may be added that Art 3 Section 2 subsection 3 is of the same nature as the first ten Amendments and yet that subsection is limited like the 7th Amendment to the courts of the United States and so to the several States and that too not only for rea sons applicable to the whole of Art 3 but because it is expressly provided that all trials for crimes shall be held in the State where the crime was committed and though it is added that when not committed in any State the trial shall be at such place as Congress by law directs yet a crime not committed in a State can come within that subsection only when it is committed on the high seas or in some place which is without an organized government and so without the means of administering justice It must be admitted that the provisions both of the original Constitution and of the amendments securing the right of trial by jury have several times been subjects of discussion in the Supreme Court and that opinions have been expressed by members of that court that these provisions extend to Territories But in the recent case of the American Publishing Co v Fisher2 the ques tion was treated as still an open one and though in the still more recent case of Thompson v Utah3 the court professedly decided that the provisions in question extended to the former territory of Utah yet it seems clear that the question was not involved in the decision The only question directly involved was whether the clause in the constitution of Utah providing that per sons accused of felonies not capital should be tried by a jury of eight persons was ex post facto as to a felony committed while I See U S v Jones I37 U S 202 Cook v U S I38 U S I57 i8x It seemrs clear also that the Constitution intended that Congress in directing the place of trial of a crime not committed in any State should select a place within the limits of somne State as otherwise the trial could not be in a United States court 2 I66 U S 464 3 170 U S 343THE STATUS OF OUR NEW TERRITORIES 387 Utah was a territory and therefore inoperative and that question was decided in the affirmative and for the reason that the law of the Territory as it was when the crime was committed required any person accused of such a crime to be tried by a jury of twelve persons But if such was the law of the Territory it seems to have been immaterial how it was established  whether by the Constitution of the United States or by Act of Congress or by Act of the territorial legislature and in fact such was the law of the Territory by virtue of an Act of the territorial legislature and there fore it was not necessary for the accused to invoke the aid of the Constitution of the United States2 It may aid us in determining the status ot our new territories to inquire what their status would be if the United States instead of being a confederation of States were a single State organized sub stantially as our several States are or if it were a monarchy either absolute or constitutional The mere acquisition by one country A for example of the sovereignty over another country B for example produces no other legal effect upon the latter than to give it a new sovereign and consequently to substitute the legislature and the chief execu tive of A for those of B but A and B will still be in strictness foreign to each other each having its own government laws and institutions and though the legislature and chief executive of each will be the same yet they will act in an entirely different capacity when acting for B from that in which they act when act ing for A3 If any greater change than this is wrought it will be because A has done something more to B than to acquire the sovereignty over her She may do with B whatever she pleases assuming the sovereignty which she has acquired over her to be absolute She may for example incorporate B so completely with A that Bs own government institutions and laws will cease to 1 See I70 U S 345 Moreover by the Act of Sept 9 I850 C 5I S I7 9 Stats 435 458 for organizing the Territory of Utah it was enacted as follows The Constitution and laws of the United States are hereby extended over and declared to be in force in said Territory of Utah so far as the same or any provision thereof may be applicable And though it was not within the power of Congress to extend the Constitution over territory to which it did not extend by its own force yet Congress could give it the effect of a statute in such territory and that was the effect of this provision 2 In Am Ins Co v Canter i Pet 5II 538 Webster arguendo said Congress had the power to refuse trial by jury to the Territory of Florida See supra page 382 3 Hence no statute made by the legislature of A as such will affect B unless it ex pressly declare that it shall extend to B See supra page 382388 HARVARD LAW REVIEW exist and even she herself will cease to exist as a separate country or A may keep the two countries entirely separate and distinct and yet reduce the inhabitants of B to a condition of servitude But if B be incorporated with A or the inhabitants of B be reduced to a condition of servitude it will not be because of the acquisition by A of the sovereignty over B but because of the action taken by A consequent upon the acquisition of such sovereignty If indeed A have a written constitution by which her government was created and organized and under which it acts and the powers of such gov ernment are subject to limitations imposed by the constitution and such limitations are made by the constitution to apply to all future acquisitions of territory and so are applicable to B of course it will follow that the government of A will be subject to the same limita tions when acting for B as when acting for A and A can get rid of these limitations in respect either to herself or B only by changing or overthrowing her constitution Does then the fact that the United States is a confederation of States make any difference It is conceived that it makes no dif ference whatever as to the foregoing principles but it does sug gest two observations which affect their application first that as all the limitations imposed upon the United States by the Consti tution have reference primarily to the States and owe their exist ence primarily to the fact that the sovereignty over the territory of each State is divided between the State and the United States there is a strong presumption that such limitations have no appli cation to territory which is subject to no State sovereignty and in which the United States can exercise all the power which can be exercised within a State either by the State or by the United States secondly that there is but one known mode of incorporating nexly acquired territory into the United States namely by admitting it as a State Much confusion of ideas has been caused as to the effect of the acquisition of new territory by the United States by the constant use of the word annexation a word which has no constitu tional or legal meaning It first came into general use in connec tion with the agitation for and against the acquisition of Texas Whether its use was by design or accident may not be certain The acquisition of Texas was peculiar in this namely that it was the first instance as it is still the only instance of the acquisition of foreign territory by admitting it as a State For this reason theTHE STA TUS OF OUR NEW TERRITORIES 389 word admission may have been thought objectionable that word having become associated with the practice of admitting as States territory already within the sovereignty of the United States The acquisition of Texas was peculiar also in another respect namely that it was the acquisition of an independent State with her own consent In this respect the case of Hawaii is similar to that of Texas and this may account for the fact that Hawaii was acquired by the process so called of annexation But however this may be the mode in which Hawaii was acquired does not at all affect her status when acquired nor make it different from that of the Spanish islands which have been acquired by conquest and by treaty with Spain What has been the practice of Congress in respect to those branches of legislation which the Constitution 2 requires to be uni form throughout the United States and does such practice indicate that Congress has held itself bound by the Constitution to make such legislation uniform throughout all territory within the sover eignty of the United States First the undoubted fact that there has been hitherto no want of uniformity in the taxes duties im posts and excises laid and collected by Congress nor in the rules of naturalization or the laws on the subject of bankruptcies estab lished by Congress proves nothing for there has not hitherto been the slightest reason why legislation upon each of these subjects should not be uniform throughout all the territory over which it extended nor have there been even two opinions upon the ques tion Secondly the earliest legislation respecting duties upon imports and tonnage was limited in its operation to the States This however may not have involved any constitutional question as it did not follow that there was to be free trade between the territories and foreign countries but rather that foreign goods could not enter the territories at all for want of any ports of entry4 1 Another point of similarity between Texas and Hawaii is that both were acquired by joint resolution The resolution of March i I845 by which Texas was acquired 5 Stats 797 is entitled Joint Resolution for annexing Texas to the United States but neither the verb annex nor the noun annexation occurs in the resolution itself The resolution of July 7 I898 by which Hawaii was acquired is entitled  Joint Reso lution to provide for annexing the Hawaiian Islands to the United States and the resolution itself declares that the said Hawaiian Islands and their dependencies be and they are hereby annexed as a part of the territory of the United States and are subject to the sovereign dominion thereof 2 Art I sec 8 subsects I and 4 3 Acts of July 31 1789 ch 5 i Stats 29 and Aug 4 1790 ch 57 i Stats I45 4 There was however early legislation imposing excise duties and this was also390 HARVARD LAW REVIEW The earliest legislation respecting naturalization  and bankruptcy 2 was also limited in its operation to the States and it seems that this was in violation of the Constitution if United States as used in Art i Section 8 subsection 4 includes the territories for a consequence was that no person residing in a territory could be naturalized and that neither any debtor residing in a territory nor the creditors of any such debtor could have the benefit of the bankrupt law Thirdly all naturalization acts except the first and all bankrupt acts except the first have been extended to the terri tories but it by no means follows that Congress regarded itself as bound by the Constitution so to extend them So also the Act of March 2 I7993 to regulate the collection of duties on imports and tonnage was extended to the then existing territories i e the latter were divided into collection districts and this is true also of all similar acts which have since been passed and of all territories which have since been acquried and if Congress had not taken this course it must have either prohibited the importation of foreign goods into territories or it must have admitted all foreign goods free of duty or it must have established for the territories a revenue system of their own Moreover there were many reasons in favor of the course adopted and none in favor of either of the other three First all the different parcels of territory acquired by the United States from time to time with the unimportant exception of Alaska were contiguous either to existing States or to terri tory previously acquired secondly none of them differed more widely from the States in soil and climate than the States differed from each other thirdly they were all virtually without inhab itants and were expected to be peopled by immigrants from the States from the British Islands and from Western Europe fourthly they were all expected at an early day to be formed into States and as such to be admitted into the Union fifthly none of them produced to any extent dutiable articles which if admitted into the United States free of duty would either deprive the government of revenue or compete with home products or produce both of these effects sixthly they all bordered upon navi limited to the States See Act of March 3 1791 ch 8i I Stats I99 It seems there fore that such legislation was in violation of Art I of the Coilstitution Sec 8 subsect i if  United States as used in that subsection includes territories as no excise duties were imposed upon the latter Act of March 26 1790 ch 29 I Stats 103 2 Act of April 4 i8oo ch i9 2 Stats I9 a I Stats 627THE STA TUS OF OUR NEW TERRITORIES 391 gable waters through which the products of all foreign countries could easily be imported into them and if admitted free of duty could be smuggled thence into the States1 With the acquisition of Hawaii and the Spanish islands however all these conditions are radically changed None of these islands have been acquired with a view to their being admitted as States and it is to be sincerely hoped that they never will be so ad mitted i e that they will never be permitted to share in the gov ernment of this country and especially to be represented in the United States Senate Their agricultural capabilities are very great their products enter almost wholly into commerce and all or nearly all of them are dutiable under our tariff Some of them consist of articles from which the government raises a great amount of revenue and most of them if admitted free of duty will compete ruinously with home products of the same kind Lastly none of these islands are manufacturing countries nor are likely to become such and none of them import articles which compete with their home products and therefore duties should be levied on articles imported into them only for purposes of revenue The strongest possible reasons therefore exist for abandoning totally in respect to our new territories the practice which has hitherto prevailed of extending to territories the revenue system of the United States and for giving to each of them a revenue system of its own2 This is required as well in justice to them as in justice to this country for while the admission of sugar and tobacco for example from those islands into this country free of duty would ruin the producers of those articles in this country and would make it necessary for the government to resort to new and oppressive modes of raising revenue the extension to those islands of our tariff on imports would compel their people to buy I On the i4th of August 1848 the then military governor of California wrote to the War Department as follows If all customs were withdrawn and the ports thrown open free to the world San Francisco would be made the depot of all the foreign goods in the North Pacific to the injury of our revenue and the interests of our own mer chants See Cross v Harrison I6 How 164 183 2 Congress seems to have taken it for granted that the revenue system of the United States was to be extended to the Hawaiian Islands for the resolution by which those islands were acquired declares that until legislation shall be enacted extending the United States customs laws and regulations to the Hawaiian Islands the existing cus toms relations of the Hawaiian Islands with the United States and other countries shall remain unchanged392 HARVARD LAW REVIEW imported articles not as their interests but as our interests dictate If we are to undertake the government of dependent countries with any hope of gaining credit for ourselves we must enter upon the task with a single eye to promoting the interests of the people governed and we must content ourselves with such material advrantages as may accrue to us incidentally from a faithful dis charge of our duty Does the Constitution of the United States prevent our attempting such a r6le If it does one will be driven to the conclusion that the authors of that instrument were either less successful in saying what they meant or else were less sagacious and farsighted than they have had the reputation of being C C Langdell NOTE TmE numerous editions of the Constitution of the United States vary somewhat in their mode of dividing the different sections into paragraphs and in numbering the paragraphs For example in Art i Section 9 some editions print in one paragraph the matter which in the preceding article is treated as constituting subsec tions 5 and 6 and this of course changes the numbering of the remaining paragraphs So in Art 2 Section i some editions do not number the third paragraph it having been superseded by the i2th Amendment Some editions also print and number the form of oath at the end of the section as a separate paragraph In the preceding article the third paragraph is regarded as numbered and the form of oath is not regarded as a separate paragraph and hence the section is referred to as containing eight subsections

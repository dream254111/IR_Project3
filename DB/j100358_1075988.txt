j100358,The School Review,1075988,The Status of Greek,i244644,THE STATUS OF GREEK A A TREVER The University of Chicago The waning interest in Greek as a staple subject of collegiate instruction is universally admitted by the apostles of culture as well as by the Philistines The actual extent of this tendency however is perhaps scarcely realized even by the classicists them selves The following results of an investigation made a few months ago may help to arouse the friends of Greek to the real situation and to suggest the lines upon which the battle must be fought if the passing of the noblest of the humanities is to be prevented The investigation included twentytwo institutions of college grade in the following states Michigan Wisconsin Minnesota South Dakota Iowa Illinois and Indiana Since the names of the colleges may not be given a general summary of the results obtained must suffice We shall present this summary under three main heads I Number of students II Obstacles to gaining and holding students III Greek courses in English I As to the number of students taking Greek the following facts were obtained i Fourteen colleges have less than twenty Greek students each Two colleges have less than ten Greek students each Three colleges have large departments ranging from ninety to one hundred students In these three however special conditions obtain In two of them Greek is still required for the AB degree while the other has about eight hundred students an exceptionally large percentage of whom are expecting to enter the ministry It may be further stated that onehalf or more of all the Greek students in these three institutions are in elementary Greek Aside from the three institutions just mentioned only one of the 254THE STATUS OF GREEK twentytwo colleges has thirty students in its Greek department In this college however nearly twothirds of the number are in elementary Greek and only four are pursuing a fourth year The investigation also revealed that in this institution Greek enjoyed the moral support of the president and faculty a condition very rare in the West In addition to the two colleges previously referred to only one institution still requires Greek for the AB degree and in this instance the requirement has not resulted in a thriving department 2 Ten colleges have no students pursuing a fourth year of Greek four colleges have only one such student each while six others have fourthyear classes ranging from two to five students Thus twenty of the twentytwo colleges have either no fourth year Greek class or else a very small one while four institutions do not even secure any students for a third year 3 Six colleges have no Greek students who began Greek in high schools and nine others have only one or two such students Only three of the twentytwo colleges have more than five students whose preparatory Greek was done in the high school and in nine of the institutions considered onethird to onehalf of the Greek stu dents did not begin the study until the Sophomore year or even later 4 Seven colleges have had only from 5 to io per cent of Greek students in their graduating classes for the past five years five others have had from IO to 20 per cent Even this low percentage however is really somewhat deceptive for it is generally recognized that for some reason which it might be interesting to consider Greek students are more likely to continue their course until graduation than are other students The reports also showed conclusively that the percentage of Greek students in the classes of I9IO was considerably below the average for the past five years The exact figures on this point cannot be given as several of the colleges did not report in detail 5 In six colleges practically no Greek students are pursuing courses in college Latin and in four others the percentage of such students is very smallnot more than from 5 to 15 per cent On the other hand in fifteen of the colleges only io per cent or less of those who are specializing in Latin are taking Greek 255THE SCHOOL REVIEW II The chief obstacles to securing Greek students and to hold ing them for more than two years were stated somewhat as follows i Greek not taught or encouraged in high schools 2 The free elective system and the great multiplicity of elect ive courses 3 The modern craze for the practical interpreted by the breadandbutter standard 4 Ignorance and prejudice in home high schools and even in college faculties More than one college teacher of Greek gives as his reason for the difficulty the influence of my colleagues against Greek 5 The demand for short cuts and snap courses and the common satisfaction with mediocrity 6 The lack of students to inspire the teacher making it diffi cult to interest the classes and to arouse a healthy competition 7 The inherent difficulty of Greek and its disappearance from the high schools Greek is not given an equal chance especially with Latin and the modern languages III Fifteen of the twentytwo colleges offer one or more Greek courses for English students such as Greek literature in transla tions Greek art Greek history Greek social life and Greek mythology The number of students in such courses ranges from five to twentyfive but the most frequent number reported was about fifteen This report of the status of Greek in twentytwo of the repre sentative colleges of the Middle West is certainly not very encour aging to worshipers at the shrine of Hellas In spite of the awaken ing of classical teachers during the past decade in spite of the fact that in most colleges Greek is being taught by improved and more vital methods it seems almost impossible to hold college students for a fourth year of Greek Indeed fifteen of the twentytwo colleges considered have only three students or less in the third year of the language However the facts of the report dark as they appear serve to suggest the lines upon which we may work to effect an amelioration of the condition 256THE STATUS OF GREEK i A determined effort should be made to persuade the college teachers of Latin to take a more positive attitude in favor of Greek What is the situation In many a Western college Greek finds Latin to be its most discouraging competitor instead of its friend and ally Since Latin is taught in every accredited high school while Greek is found in but few many highschool students are turned toward Latin and come to college with the purpose of con tinuing their study in the language They are further attracted to specialize in it since it offers fair opportunities for highschool teaching Moreover the college Latin departments in the effort to secure as many advanced students as possible practically require prospective teachers to take so much Latin that it is almost impos sible for them to take up Greek Instead of positively influencing their best students to balance their classical preparation by a knowl edge of the Greek language and literature they often discourage this by demanding all the students time in Latin thus producing a narrow and onesided teacher It thus results as the report shows that only io per cent or less of the Latin specialists in fifteen of the colleges are taking Greek Now the college teachers of Latin must be aroused to the fact that the cause of Greek is their own cause that in the long run Greek and Latin stand or fall together above all that the teacher of Latin in the high school must be circumscribed and visionless in his teaching indeed that he must fail to appreciate much in the literature life institutions and language he teaches without a fair knowledge of things Greek It should be needless to remind the teachers of Latin of the truth already trite to them concerning the intimate relation of Latin and Greek It would sometimes seem however that they need such a reminder and at any rate a brief statement of the facts may not be amiss for the uninitiate Greek and Latin have a multitude of rootwords common to both languages Their inflections are very similar as is also much of their syntax Without Greek the Latinist is utterly unable to explain or appreciate numberless points of etymology syntax and inflection many of which demand explanation even in the teach ing of elementary Latin 257THE SCHOOL REVIEW But this is not all Latin is largely a borrowed literature from Greek originals Greek literature was the very breath of life to the Roman writers Vergil had his Homer and Theocritus Horace and Catullus their Greek lyrists Cicero his Isocrates Demos thenes and Plato Plautus his Menander and so on throughout almost the entire catalogue of Latin authors They were close students of Greek literary style They imitated Greek models and their imagination was kindled by a spark from the Greek fire They copied Greek figures and idioms appropriated Greek plots in epic and drama employed Greek rhythms and meters imitated Greek feeling in their lyrics parroted Greek philosophy accepted the Greek orators and rhetoricians as their masters Indeed every Roman classical writer drank deep of the Pierian spring and this fact is so evident on almost every page of Latin literature that he who runs may read Almost every Latin classic can be traced back to a Greek classic of greater genius In the face of such facts what shall we think of a preparation for Latin instruction even in the high schools that does not take account of Greek literature from which the Latin drew not only its inspiration but even the tools and materials for its product  What must be the limitation of that Latinist who cannot look beyond the Latin imitations to the Greek originals Is it any wonder when so many of our highschool Latinists are strangers to Greek literature that much of their teaching is dead and visionless a mere languagegrind devoid of any quickening to the imagination But not only are Greek and Latin cognate languages not only are Greek thought and style so interwoven into Latin literature as to make this often unintelligible without a knowledge of Greek but the Greeks and the Romans had multitudinous points of con tact in life institutions and history Numberless references on the pages of the Latin classics are opaque to him who is a stranger to the civilization whose torch was the light of the Roman world To prove this one need only turn the pages haphazard of any annotated edition of a Latin author One will find explanatory ref erences to Greek life institutions and ideas abundant everywhere It is high time then that the friends of classical learning begin to demand more unitedly and insistently that our instructors in 258THE STATUS OF GREEK highschool Latin shall have at least a modicum of Greek Every college teacher of Latin both for the sake of selfpreservation and for the sake of vital and intelligent Latin instruction should insist that every prospective teacher in his department have at least two years of Greek as a prerequisite for a recommendation to teach Latin Then not only would our college department of Greek be increased by the entrance of prospective Latin teachers but many highschool graduates would come to college determined to seek out the fountain of Greek genius whence their teachers drew their inspiration and it would not be long before there would arise a new impetus to the teaching and study of the classics in the high schools 2 The friends of the classics should endeavor to secure for Greek an equal chance with the modern languages Under the present arrangement in most colleges Greek has almost no chance at all The modern languages are so much easier that a student must be entirely unafraid of work in order to choose the much more diffi cult subject for the same credit A much fairer method would be that which is I believe in vogue in some institutions of counting credits instead of hours as the requirement for graduation Let all the courses of the curriculum be standardized in accord with a certain two or three studies accepted as fundamental Then some studies though given the same number of hours a week will count more credits than others because of their inherent difficulty Moreover such a method would do away with one of the great evils of the free elective systemthat of seeking after snap courses Whatever may be said to the contrary it is still a notorious fact that by the very nature of the subject some courses are neces sarily harder and require more brain sweat than others and this in spite of all that the instructor can do For example a course in Lowells poems cannot possibly be made as difficult as calculus or philosophy sociology cannot demand the time required for the mastery of a course in elementary chemistry Spanish and French cannot by any method known to man be made as difficult as Greek Indeed most Greek teachers themselves are offering courses for English students which in no way compare in difficulty with the regular classical studies The list of examples might be indefinitely lengthened and far more absurd comparisons might 259THE SCHOOL REVIEW be made as for instance when courses in choral singing athletics or kitchen mechanics are given equal credit hour for hour with the most difficult courses in the curriculum The elective system with all its benefits must continue to work great evils and unfair ness to students and teachers alike until it is placed upon a rational foundation by some such method of standardization of studies as the one proposed The superficial objection that such standardi zation would be impossible is the answer of the unprogressive and standpat teacher Though it would doubtless involve many problems yet there is no inherent reason why it should be impossible of attainment and surely the present system should be odious to all college men who seek fairness or intellectual thoroughness 3 The teachers of Greek must conceive their subject in afar broader way than formerly They must realize that they are set to teach not a language merely but a literature and a life Their business is to keep bright the flame of Greek inspiration in their own breasts and thus to kindle it in others While conserving carefully the interests of thorough scholarship and linguistic attainment they must steer clear of the rock of pedantry and mere dryasdust language grind It is a pleasure to note as is indicated in the above report that many of the teachers of Greek in the colleges of the Middle West have awakened to this need Fifteen of the twentytwo colleges considered are offering courses in one or more phases of Greek civilization for English students and though in many of the institu tions such courses are still new and but meagerly attended yet this is a step in the right direction These courses are bound to grow in popularity and attendance for Hellas has abundant wealth to offer all who are devoted to the ideal They can of course never take the place of a firsthand knowledge of the Greek genius through the language itself Yet in this day when worship of the bread andbutter practical has invaded even the temple of learning itself it were well to dispense freely the diluted wine wherever there is no appetite for the unmixed draught These courses will not turn the thoughts of students away from Greek and make them think that the study of translations and compilations is enough 260THE STATUS OF GREEK Rather will they open the eyes of the students to the existence of this wonderful civilization to which all modern life owes so great a debt The students will realize inevitably too under compe tent teachers the entire inadequacy of the translations and the necessity of a knowledge of the originals if they would gain the key to unlock those doors of the treasurehouse where the costliest gems lie hidden Above all giving such courses is sure to quicken the imagination and vitalize the teaching of the professors of Greek themselves who too often in the past have permitted their great task to degenerate into a mere perfunctory exercise in translation and grammar These are a few of the points suggested by the results of the above investigation Several others might well be considered as for instance just what is the rational basis for giving Latin the preference in high school and college when as is generally con ceded Greek has so much more of intellectual wealth to offer the student However this and other questions of interest must be left for future consideration Suffice it to say that the case of Greek is not yet closed as the Philistines would have it and it need not be if only the friends of classical learning will sink all jealousies and get together in the determined attempt to attain such ends as are outlined in this paper 26I

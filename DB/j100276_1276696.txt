conveyance valid Defendant together with her husband entered into an executory contract with plaintiff to convey her real estate No privy exam ination of the wife was had In an action against her for damages for failure to convey held two justices dissenting that she was liable War ren v Dail N C I915 87 S E I26 The prevailing opinion in construing Chapter Io9 of Public Laws of I9II puts undue emphasis upon that portion thereof which reads every married woman shall be authorized to contract and deal so as to affect her real and personal property in the same manner as if she were unmarried but fails to observe the latter portion of the same statute which provides that no conveyance shall be valid unless made with the written assent of her hus band    and her privy examination as to the execution of the same taken The dissenting opinion points out that the deed or contract of a married woman charging her real estate    is a nullity unless she be privily examined Scott v Battle 85 N C I84 39 Am Rep 694 Farthing v Shields Io6 N C 289 0 S  E 998 Council v Pridgen 153 N C 443 69 S E 404 Smith v Burton 137 N C 9 49 S E 64 If the feme defendant had attempted to perform the executory contract to sell the performance would have been a nullity It is an anomaly that she should be held liable in damages under these circumstances INSURANCESTOPPBL AND WAIVER o CONDITION IN BRNEMIT POLICY The South Carolina Code provides that wlhere a fraternal insurance or beneficiary society has lodges members of which are required to pay pre miums to local officers to transmit the same to the general office such local officers collecting the premiums shall be deemed agents of the general order it also provides that no subordinate body or any of its officers shall have power to waive any of the provisions of the laws and constitution of the association The constitution and Ibylaws of the Woodmen of the World provide that no officer of the Sovereign Camp or any Camp shall have power to waive any of the conditions on whicih beneficiary certificates are issued that a members failure to pay an assessment for over a month would work a suspension of such member and that a member so suspended must make warranty that he is in good health before he can be reinstated Held that the clerk of a local Camp by collecting assessments so long overdue that a suspension has resulted may bind the society even though the delinquent member had not made the necessary warranty Crumley v Sovereign Camp of Woodmen of the World S C I915 86 S E 054 The decision of the court is placed on two grounds that the waiver of the condition precedent to the reinstatement by the agent binds the insurer and that the insurer is estopped to deny the act of the agent and to contend that the member who died in the interim was suspended The reinstate ment is in effect a contract which is wholly executed by the oither party and the insurerhaving had the benefit of the performance of itcannot set up its own wrong this is in short an application of the doctrine of estoppel to set up an ultra vires defense Williamson v Assn 54 S C 582 424MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW Eastern B  L Assn v Williamson I89 U S 122 The fact that the local clerk is designated as an agent is sufficient to take the case from the effect of the statutory provision regarding local lodges or officers waiving condi tions and for that reason the act of the clerk in waiving the condition is binding on the Sovereign Camp in the first instance with powler in its part however within a reasonable time to review the act of the agent The agent in making the report of the reinstatement neglected to state that the warranty had been received and the Sovereign Camp being responsible for the failure of the agent to discharge his duties the estoppel results nat urally Vought v East B  L Assn 172 N Y 508 INSURANCEFORFEITURE BY TRANSFER OF PROPERTYWhere property is insured against loss by fire wilth a clause forfeiting the policy if any change in the title interest or possession of the insured takes place and a convey ance by insured to another is made held that the policy is not void in the absence of a declaration of forfeiture if the property is subsequently trans ferred again to the insured who holds and owns it at the time the loss occurs in the same manner as at the time the contract was made Germania Fire Ins Co v Turley Ky I915 179 IS W IO59 This point has been before the courts many times and several courts hold the policy to be Void basing the result on tlhe theory that when the transfer is made by the insured the contract at once is forfeited and the subsequent transfer placing the property again in the hands of the insured has no effect in reviving the contract Cockerill v Cincinnati Mut Ins Co 16 Oh St I48 Farmers Ins Co v Archer 36 Oh St 608 Mulville v Adams I9 Fed 887 Home Ins Co v Hauslein 6o Ill 52I Bemis v Har borcreek Ins Co 200 Pa St 340 The contrary view in accord with the principal case is asserted in German Mut Fire Ins Co v Fox 4 Neb 833 Power v Ocean Ins Co I9 La 28 Hitchcock v N W Ins Co 26 N Y 68 Stearman v Niagara Fire Ins Co 46 N Y 526 Worthington v Bearse 12 Allen Mass 382 Schloss v Westchester Fire Ins Co I41 Ala 566 Born v Home Ins Co IIo Ia 379 The theory underlying the principal case and the view it supports is that the violation of the policy merely sus pends the insurance during the violation and when the insured reacquires the title the policy is renewed and the insurer again becomes liable This rule seems to be grounded on the policy of not favoring forfeitures and of strictly construing any clause which works a forfeiture of the policy Three states have also reached this same result by statutory provisions North Dakota Rev Code 1899  4457 South

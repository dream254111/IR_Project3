synonymis  locis natalibus adjectis aliis quibusdam quae in insulis Maderae Bar bados Nieves  Sancti Christophori nas cuntur seu prodromi historiae naturalis Jamai cae pars prima Autore Hans Sloane M D Coll reg Med Lond nec non Soc Reg Lond Soc Londini Impensis Dan Brown ad In signe Cygni  Biblioram extra portam vulgo dictam Templebar 1696 in 8 with some Remarks on it by John Ray A M  F R S T H E Author of this Catalogue doth not present the Reader with Titles of Plants Collected out of other Mens Writings or of which he had seen only dryed Specimens but of such as himself saw growing in their Native Places Among which there are a great Multitude of New and Nondescript Species in one Genus alone viz Those called Capillaries no less then Threescore besides those lately Published by F Plumier in his first Volume of Descriptions of American Plants which our Author had observed and described long be fore that Book came out and these not small and con temptible ones or hardly distinguishable from the Plants of that kind already described but of eminent Stature and Beauty and some of them of so strange and exotick Form that if delineated they could not X x but294 but invite and gratefully entertain the Spectators Eye For First Who would not be delighted to see an arbo rescent Fern of a single Woody Stem streight and undivided bearing leaves only at the top like a Palm Tree Capillaries of almost all kinds creeping on Trees or Rocks or the Ground with Wires after the manner of Strawberries Or Thirdly Capillaries the tip of whose leaves turning downwards and touching the Earth takes Root and puts forth a new Plant so Pro pagating their kind Or Fourthly Capillaries putting forth from the middle Stem of their Leaves two shoots each bearing a Spike of Flowers and Seeds I confess when I first saw the Authors stock of dryed Plants colle cted in Jamaica and some of the Caribee Islands I was much surprised and even astonished at the number of the Capillary kind not thinking there had been so ma ny to be found in both the Indies I might say much of the other Generabut I refer the Reader to the Book it self Secondly The Author in this Catalogue hath done great Service to at least the inferior Ranks of Herba rarists in reducing and cutting short the number of Species which were unnecessarily multiplied For ob serving that those who have published Itineraries or Descriptions of the several parts of America for want of sufficient Skill in Botanicks and not being versed in Describing Plants have given us such lame imperfect and obscure Descriptions of such as they took Notice of and of the same Tree or Herb many times under different Names that the Compilers of general Histories of Plants meeting with these Descriptions and having no other knowledge of such Plants then what they derived from themhave repeated one and the same Species found in far distant Countries by various Observers and differently described once twice thrice may some great Au thors sometimes even nine times over for different kinds295 kinds Now the Number of Plants being in Nature so vast its pity to add to it more then there are in Na ture making two or three of one thereby both deter ing and confounding the Learner To clear up these diffi cultiesand to reduce all to their proper kinds no man can be well qualifiedbut he that hath a Comprehensive Know ledge of such Plants as grow wild or are commonly Cul tivated in Gardens here in Europe and hath seen the non descript Americans or such as are here less known grow ing in their natural places and hath read considered and compared what hath been written of them either by such who have lived some time in those Countries and published Descriptions or natural Histories of themor by such as have only made Voyages thither and given us Relations and Accounts of their Travels and what they observed during their short stay there All which quali ties occur in our Author Thirdly This Work is of great use to those that are delighted in reading the Relations and Accounts of Navi gators and Travellersto and in those partsto inform them concerning the Names of American and Indian Plantsthey shall therein meet with to what Plants they belong and where they may find exact Descriptions or Characteri stick Notes of them The Author having with infinite Pains and Patience read the most part of the Books of Voyages and Travels extant referred the Plants he met with therein named or described to their proper Genera or Titlesunder which they are Ranked and by which they are denominated and Characterized by the most Learned and Skilful Herbarists of the present or imme diately precedent Age Fourthly The Author in this Work hath cleared up and resolved many Doubts and Difficulties and informed us of what Plants are signified by many Names frequent in the Mouths and Writings of our own Countreymen of296 of which before we were either Ignorant or in some doubt For Example He hath informed us that the Dumb Cane so called which being tasted inflames the Tongue and Jaws in that manner that for a while it takes away the use of Speech is not properly any Species of Reed or Cane but of Arum or WakeRobin which quality indeed agrees very well to the Nature of an Arum which is very Acrimonious but not to any sort of Cane That Logwood is not as we conjectured the Ligno Brasiliano simile seu Lignum Sapou la nistingendis percommodum of Caspar Baubine but Lignum Cam pechianum so called from Campecbe a Province of the Con tinent of America where they Fell Yearly grear Store of these Trees and bring them to Jamaica and our other Plan tations to be Transported hither for the use of Diers That the Dildoetree is the same with the Cereus or TorchPlant Caeterum Dildoe nonnullis Priapum fictitium significat quo effrae nis lascivae mulierculae abuti solent ad nefariae quoddam libidinis genus seu coitum umbratilem exercendum I might add to these the ToddyTree the Pricklypear the SowerSop Bonavists and many others whose Significations may be found in this Ca talogue Besides We are assured by this Work that there are some Plants common not only to Europe and America but even to England and Jamaica notwithstanding the great distance of Place and difference both of Longitude and Climate But here it is to be noted that the greatest part of these common Plants are such as grow in the Water or Wateryplaces there being it seems a greater agreement between the tem per of the Waters then of the Air in these remotely distant Countries

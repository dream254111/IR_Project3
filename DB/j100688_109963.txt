the Suns Rays Abstract,i207044,135 the cylinder being flattened so as to yield to the expansion of the water forced in By weighing this instrument full of water before and after it had been submitted to the pressure the quantity of water forced in was ascertained whence it appeared that under a pressure of 326 atmospheres the water had sustained an increase of 39 per cent In a future communication the author proposes to detail the results of a new set of experiments on the compressibility of water which he hopes will be susceptible of greater precision Astronomical Observations By Stephen Groombridge Esq FRS Read June 29 1820 Phil Trans 1820 p 330 In the present improved state of astronomical observations it is material to possess the readiest and most accurate means of finding the apparent time The right ascension of certain fixed stars having been precisely obtained relatively with each other and with the equi noctial points during the course of many years affords the direct method of ascertaining the right ascension of the midheaven hence the convenience of having the corrections of these stars in the fotm of tables that the same may be taken out at one view with the ar guments of the suns longitude and of the moons node For this purpose the mean diurnal motion is adapted to the longitude of the sun as found in the Nautical Almanac at the time the star passes the meridian The mean epoch is reduced to the vernal equinox less four seconds in order to render the corrections additive which being an universal period the same applies to all parts of the world To these tables Mr Groombridge has subjoined some observations of the planets at and near the oppositions also of the solstices of the last two years and of the comet of 1819 On the Black Rete Mucosum of the Negro being a Defence against the Scorching Efect of the Suns Rays By Sir Everard Home Bart FRS Read November 9 1820 Phil Trans 1821 p 1 The use of the black rete mucosum of the negro is a subject which has fruitlessly engaged the attention of the physiologist The authors mind was directed to this inquiry by the circumstance of a silver fish having its back scorched in consequence of the removal of some trees which shaded the pond in which it lived this recalled to Sir Everards recollection the circumstance of his having suffered severely from the scorching sun of the tropic upon parts of the body protected from the direct rays of the sun by thin white linen and led him to suspect that the noxious effects were derived not as has commonly been sup posed from the mere heating power of the suns rays but from the joint agency of heat and light he therefore made certain experi ments detailed in this paper which show that the face and hands may be exposed to a temperature of 1000 to 120 without producing pain provided light be excluded but that if the same or even an inferior degree of heat be produced by the direct light of the sun it136 scorches and elevates the cuticle in blisters this effect is prevented by covering the hand or face with thin black kerseymere and the same purpose is attained by the black rete mucosum of the negro In these cases perspiration comes on which it does not in the former and the surface though actually hotter is uninjured Nature has provided a similar defence from the injury of light by placing a black pigment at the bottom of the eye of those animals who are exposed to the intensity of the suns rays whereas in the inhabitants of shady and dark situations the pigment is either pale or altogether wanting The author concludes this paper by ascribing the beneficial effects which he has shown to result from the black matter in the negros skin and at the bottom of the eyes in certain animals to the power which black surfaces possess of converting the radiant matter of the sun into sensible heat On the Magnetic Phenomena produced by Electricity In a Letter from Sir Humphry Davy Bart FRS toW H Wollaston MDPRS Read November 16 1820 Phil Trans 1821 p 7 In repeating the experiments of Oersted Sir Humphry found that with a voltaic battery of 100 pair of 4inch plates the south pole of a magnetic needle placed under the communicating wire of platinum the positive end of the apparatus being on the right was strongly attracted by the wire which was shown to be itself magnetic by its power of attracting steel filings and of communicating permanent magnetism to steel bars attached to it transversely while similar bars placed parallel to the wire were only magnetic during its connection with the voltaic apparatus The actual contact however of the steel wire with that of platinum or other metal forming the voltaic con ductor is not necessary for magnetism was communicated to a needle placed transversely to it but at some distance Sir Humphry Davy next details some experiments showing that the magnetic power is proportionate to the quantity of electricity passing through a given space without any relation to the trans mitting metal and that the finer the wires the stronger their mag netism He found an analogous effect produced by the discharge of a Leyden phial through a wire and by passing the discharge of as Leyden battery of 17 square feet through a silver wire with a steel bar transversely attached to it of two inches in length the latter be came powerfully and permanently magnetic The same effect was produced at a distance of five inches through air water and even through thick plates of glass When several wires parallel to each other form part of the same circuit each becomes similarly magnetic to the single wire and the opposite sides of such wires are in different magnetic states and con sequently attract each other By arranging two voltaic batteries parallel to each other the positive end of the one being opposite to thei egative end of the other and transmitting their clectricities

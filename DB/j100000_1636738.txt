j100000,Science,1636738,Glacial Excursion of the Canadian Geological Congress,i296281,MAY 9 1913 SCIENCE must be sought the key to much of the early history of the Titicaca depression The Tia huanaco Valley and its celebrated ruins will be studied in relation to the supposed ancient levels of Lake Titicaca and the limits of food production in the valley today Professor Bowmans results will be pub lished in preliminary form in the Bulletin of the American Geographical Society and in final form in a volume entitled  The Central Andes GLACIAL EXCURBSION OF THE CANADIAN GEOLOGICAL CONGRESS SEVERAL of the excursions in connection with the twelfth International Geological Congress held in Canada next summer will go from Toronto to Vancouver Then an ex cursion C8 August 29 to September 22 under the leadership of R G McConnell and with guidance of R W Brock D D Cairnes and W W Leach will traverse the fiords of British Columbia ascend the Skeena River valley from Prince Rupert to Aldermere by rail visiting the silverlead mines and coal mines and continuing to Skagway by steamer There will be stops at the copper mines on Portland Canal and the Treadwell gold mine on the Gastineau fiord at Juneau The excursions will then cross the Canadian Coast Range by the White Pass and Yukon Railway to Whitehorse stopping at the copper deposits there and the coal mines at Tantalus descending the Yukon River to Dawson and the Klondike gold field in the driftless in terior plateau near latitude 64 north After the return to Skagway an excursion under the direction of Lawrence Martin of the University of Wisconsin will be made on a special steamer to the Malaspina Glacier Yakutat Bay and Muir Glacier where Rus sell Wright Reid Gilbert and Tarr have done worldrenowned work This glacial ex cursion will last five days with a possibility of two days more in case of cloudy weather The first day will afford an opportunity of seeing the Fairweather and St Elias Ranges 16000 to 18000 feet high and covered by snowfields and glaciers These ice tongues in clude the La Perouse Malaspina and many smaller glaciers The front of the great pied mont ice sheet of Malaspina Glacier will be followed affording an opportunity of seeing the tidal ice front of the Guyot lobe west of Yahtse River the moraineveneered ice cliff of the Seward lobe at Sitkagi Bluffs and the forestcovered terminus of the Marvine lobe near Point Manby On the second day something will be seen of the eastern border of Malaspina Glacier in Yakutat Bay and the forested terminal mo raine of the Yakutat Foreland Landings will be made in Disenchantment Bay in con nection with various glacial phenomena such as the shrubcovered ablation moraine upon the ice of Variegated Glacier the streams en gaged in carrying and depositing outwash gravels the calving of icebergs from Hub bard and Turner glaciers the cirque vacated by a fallen glacier and the beaches rock benches sea cliffs and islands which were up lifted from 7 to 47i feet during the earth quakes of September 1899 The third day will be spent on and near the Nunatak Glacier in Russell Fiord Here the hanging valleys the tillveneered overridden outwash gravels and the tidal landending and cascading glaciers will be visited and studied as well as the phenomena of glacial erosion in the barren area from which the ice has recently retreated and of fault scarps made during the 1899 earthquake Some of these scarps are vertical and are 4j to 8 feet high The fourth day will afford an opportunity of seeing the morainic and glaciofluviatile phenomena about the terminus of the Hidden Glacier which advanced 2 miles between 1906 and 1909 as a result of the earthquake avalanching in 1899 which has subsequently caused 9 ice tongues of Yakutat Bay to move forward After this landing something will be seen of a fiord with submerged hang ing valleys submarine moraines buried for ests shorelines depressed in 1899 and the high strand lines of a former glacial lake Part of the fifth day will be devoted to 703N S VOL XXXVII No 958 Glacier Bay where there has been a recession of 82 miles at Muir Glacier from 1899 to 1911 A landing will be made in Muir Inlet to see the buried forests the vertical ablation of over 1200 feet of ice in 12 years and many other phenomena The rapid recession of Grand Pacific Glacier in Reid Inlet at the head of Glacier Bay now places part of this fiord in Canada The glacier melted back 50007400 feet in two months during the summer of 1912 as was determined by N J Ogilvie of the Canadian Boundary Survey At the International Boundary there is now dry land and open fiord where the ice was at least 1750 feet thick as recently as 1894 Sixty miles of Glacier Bay have been opened to the ocean by glacier recession since 1794 making an arm of the sea as long as Hardanger Fiord in Norway The National Geographic Society of Wash ington has made a grant of money to Pro fessor Martin to enable him to make detailed studies at Grand Pacific and Muir Glaciers while the excursion is in the Klondike He will a measure the recession of several ice tongues in Glacier Bay b look for advances of glaciers c study the exhumed forests in relation to former glacial oscillations and d make soundings in Canadas new harbor and other uncharted waters recently vacated by the glaciers to see the effects of ice sculp ture

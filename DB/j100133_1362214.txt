BREWSTER 1 WITH DRAWINGS BY I A FUERTES A LTHOUGH Dr C W Townsend has given us a recent and admirable ac count2 of the manner in which the males of the American Goldeneye pay court to the females this subject is still comparatively novel and so very full of interest that I am tempted to offer some observations of my own regarding it They were noted briefly on loose slips of paper when I was making them and written out more fully in my journal only a few hours later As the journal de scription records them exactly as they impressed me at a time when they were fresh in my mind and recollection I shall quote from it almost literally making indeed no changes save such as seem absolutely liecessary The figures illustrating some of the poses assumed by the birds when showing off have been kindly drawn for me by Mr Fuertes from rough sketches in my note book The journal runs as follows Back Bay Basin Boston Massachusetts Feb 27 o909 I saw and heard today for the first time under exceptionally favorable conditions the courting ac tions and love notes of the American Goldeneye Clangula clangula americana Dr C W Townsend gave me some account of them last year just after he had witnessed them in February or March On February 24 of the present year he was kind enough to notify me that the birds had already begun to perform on the 22nd I think I have therefore taken advantage of the first favorable opportunity to learn something of the matter at first hand When I left our house about nine oclock this morning the sky was cloudless but a thin mist or haze obscured distant objects The air had a sharp frosty tang although the thermometer had already risen from 26 to 340 Fahrenheit There was a light easterly wind but it began to die away soon after I reached my 1 Read before the American

Harvard Bridge No birds of any kind were then visible above i e to the northwestward of the bridge but just below it I at once saw fifty or sixty Goldeneyes scattered about singly in pairs and in small flocks on the slightly ruffled water Walking down the roadway at the rear of the line of houses that front on Beacon Street I came to a pile of lumber on the recently filled parkway land about one hundred yards from the bridge and at the very edge of the river Here I found a comfortable seat on which I remained for over an hour watching the birds through my glass and taking down brief notes of their behaviour from time to time The lumber screened me somewhat from their view but I doubt if this made any particular difference for they did not seem to notice me when I stood up and walked about Those nearest at hand were within shotgun range those farthest removed not over two hundred yards away the others were dispersed over the intermediate space occurring most numerously perhaps about midway between its outer and inner confines one hundred yards or so from where I sat As many of them kept diving and shifting under water from one group to the next it was impossible to count them accurately but the total number was not far from sixty There were about thirty fully adult males perhaps ten immature males showing only a little white on cheeks and scapulars and some twenty females Most of the females appeared to have uni colored and dark brown or blackish bills but one showed a conspicuous bar of golden yellow on the culmen just behind the nail and a well marked dusky band crossing the white on the wing This bird was evidently closely similar to one that I sent to Professor Baird in December 1871 which he pronounced to be an example of Bucephala IcelandicaI but which I afterwards concluded was an aberrant spec men of americana Another female had a short abruptly tapering bill which appeared to be almost wholly of a rich chrome yellow color The white on its wings was crossed by a conspicuous black bar and the brown of its head and neck was at least two shades deeper than in any of the other females while its head had a purplish sheen which showed every time the sunlight struck it at just the right angle All this I saw most plainly for the bird was twice within forty yards of me and for half an hour within one hundred yards moreover it was repeatedly joined by one or more females of the common Goldeneye with which I was thus enabled to directly compare it Although I do not claim to have positively identi fied it I have really no doubt that it was a perfectly typical representative of Bar rows Goldeneye Dr C W Townsend tells me that he observed a similar look ing female near the same place on February 22nd The one seen by me on the morning of the 2th kept by itself for the most part but occasionally it joined or was joiged by some of the American Goldeneyes and once it swam a long dis tance in company with the female having the yellow bar on the bill both birds being followed and most assiduously courted by seven or eight fullplumaged Whistler drakes who moreover continued to devote themselves to the female Barrows Goldeneye after the other bird of the same sex the aberrant americana had left the group I had not been long at the lumber pile when the wind died away completely During the next half hour the entire Basin was almost without a ripple and shin ing in the sunlight like a burnished mirror The haze too had nearly disap peared As the sun was behind me its light aided rather than interfered with my observation of the Goldeneyes The females were comparatively inconspicu ous partly because of their sober coloring but also I thought because they habit 1 cf Brewster Auk xxvI Apr 1909 pp 154155Jan 1911 COURTSHIP OF THE AMERICAN GOLDENEYE 25 ually sank themselves deeper in the water than did the drakes The latter whether adult or immature floated very lightly showing the greater part of their bodies above the surface Those in full nuptial plumage were handsome birds whose strongly contrasting black and white coloring made them conspicuous under all conditions and at long distances When they were near at hand I could see the greenish iridescence on their big fluffy heads glint and shimmer in the sunlight Evidently they were quite conscious of their personal attractiveness and devoted themselves to bringing it to the attention of the females by a variety of odd and interesting motions some of which were calculated to display it to the best advan tage They kept calling also uttering a queer strident note wholly new to me While thus engaged they were incessantly swimming to and fro shifting from one group of birds to another and ever seeking or following the females with tireless persistence but without haste and with a decorous restraint of manner most unus ual in courting birds and very interesting to behold By no means all the fully mature drakes took part in these proceedings There were at least five or six of them who remained apart from the others either in solitary state or each in com pany with a female apparently its mate and who busied themselves during the entire time I had them under observation in diving for food or floating idly on the glassy surface preening their feathers every now and then The others while actively employed in showing off in the presence of the females indulged as I have said in a variety of movements gesticulations and postures all more or less grotesque and probably most of them peculiar to the season of lovemaking if not also characteristic of the ceremonial of Whistler courtship I saw them all re peated many times under conditions very favorable for close and accurate observa tion For convenience of treatment in describing them I shall first designate them by the following terms which if somewhat fanciful are I trust at least helpfully suggestive GESTICUIATIONS 1 The nodmade with the head 2 The kickmade upward with one or both  feet 3 The forward thrustof the head and neck 4 The upward thrustof the head and neck 5 The back thrustof the head and neck FIXED AND PECUIIAR ATTITUDES 1 The crouching pose 2 The wounded duck pose 3 The bowsprit pose 4 The masthead pose 5 The folded duckskin pose To these should be added for purposes of comparison 6 The normalposeie the position ordinarily taken by birds of both sexes when floating or swimming about The love note to which I have alluded may be known as the bleat I do not like this term for it is not accurately suggestive of the sound but it comes nearer being so than anything else I can think ofhence its adoption After hearing it hundreds of times this morning I should describe it as a short flat vibrant faaaf not unlike that of the Woodcock but a trifle more prolonged and also less harsh and incisive It reminded me somewhat of the blast of a penny trumpet less forcibly of the wheezy quack of a drake Black Duck It did not26 THE CONDOR Vol XIII seem loud when uttered within fifty yards of me yet I could hear it distinctly at four or five times that distance when the air was still It was sometimes doubled fiaaafifiaaafi and occasionally trebled faafifiaafaa I suspected at first that these doubled and trebled notes were produced by two or three birds calling nearly together but on studying the sounds closely I found that their component parts or syllables were each shorter than the normal single call and otherwise slightly dif ferent This led me to conclude that the compound notes were probably made by single birds Negative evidence supporting this inference was furnished by the fact that whenever I was able to watch several drakes performing in company I noticed that they always called in orderly succession at distinctly separate inter vals and that their notes were of normal length and form The intervals how ever were ofteni very brief and when nine or ten birds were engaged at once their voices produced a volume of sound well nigh continuous and lasting perhaps for half a minute or more This softened by distance and coming over the glassy sunlit water from just where it would have been difficult to determine had not its author been plainly visible was by no means unpleasing in its general effect But when the faaajf was heard near at hand and critically regarded it did not impress me so favorably Indeed it is essentially unmusical and decidedly less attractive in quality than the hummingtop sound made by the wings in flight to which the Whistler owes its familiar name and which was much in evidence this morning whenever the birds were moving from place to place They rose from the water with great apparent ease and almost as quickly as Black Duck despite the absence of wind When they alighted they often struck the water almost at full speed just after closing their wings sending the spray flashing up into the sunshine and ploughing furrows yards in length as they slid over the surface before losing the impetus of flight Besides the bleat and the whistling of wings I heard them make no other sound Just as the Paaaf was utteredor perhaps a fraction of a second latera slen der shower or spurt of water not unlike that emanating from an oldfashioned metal garden syringe vigorously used might often but by no means in variably be seen rising immediately behind the bird to a height of one or two feet Sometimes it was thrown almost straight upwards but oftener it followed a long elliptical or bowshaped backward curve the heavier drops falling to the surface within a yard of the bird the lighter ones striking two or three yards at its rear This jetlike puff of mingled drops and spray was sometimes conspicuous at a dis tance of fully a quarter of a mile It was produced without question by a vigor ous and obviously most dextrous upwardkick of the Whistlers broad webbed feet which indeed I saw plainly more than once jerked out of water just as the last drops were ascending into the air When as occasionally happened the jet was doubled in volume and also apparently somewhat divided at the base I thought that the bird had made simultaneous use of both feet but of this I could not be sure for I never actually saw more than one of them Owing to its force and direction the kick caused the hinder portions of the birds body to sink perceptibly in the water for an instant after which these parts bobbed still more obviously upward before recovering the position usual to the floating or swimming bird The crouching posture This was usually assumed directly from the normal swimming attitude and by an almost instantaneous movement the head being thrust forward well above the surface the neck deeply curved the back somewhat humped After remaining in this posture absolutely motionless for two or three seconds the Whistler would either resume its normal attitude or change to The wondled duck posture In this the bird would lie with head and exJan1911 COURTSHIP OF THE AMERICAN GOLDENEYE 27 tended neck flat on the surface and with its body so deeply immersed that from bill to tail it showed no part much higher than the rest looking indeed like a stick or reedstem partly submerged I have freqently seen a wounded Black Duck or Bluewinged Teal do nearly if not exactly the same thing when trying to escape observation The Goldeneyes maintained this posture anywhere from one or two to eight or ten seconds at a time Forward thrust of head and neck ending in the bowsprit posture The drakes assumed this attitude by suddenly thrusting their heads and necks forward and upward from the normal position this was evidently the usual way or by raising them more slowly from the crouching or the woundedduck posture I saw them take it a dozen times or more On each occasion the bird remained absolutely motionless for several seconds with its neck elongated to the utmost and held perfectly straight and rigid at an angle with the water of about 450 suggest ing the bowsprit of a vessel of ancient type Although this pose is apparently taken less frequently than some of the others it appears to be not less deliberate and pronounced than the rest and equally expressive of emotions due primarily to sexual excitement During its continuance the feathers of the head were some times fluffed out but oftener pressed down so very flat that the head looked scarce thicker than the neck which because of its unusual elongation appeared abnor mally slender The bill was only slightly opened As a rule the bird kept silent when in this position but twice I saw as well as heard it bleat In one of these instances it kicked up water just as it uttered the Paaaif in the other this action was omitted When the head was raised to the bowsprit posture from the crouch ing or the woundedduck pose the movement was not especially rapid but when it was thrust directly forward and upward from the normal position the action was so swift and abrupt that my eye could scarce follow it Although I witnessed the bowsprit posture a number of times it was assumed less often than either of the two fixed positions which I am about to describe Upward thrust of head and neck ending in the masthead posture Ordinarily this movement was complete in itself and made directly fromas well as back tothe normal position Occasionally however it closely preceded or immediately followed a still longer backward swingyet to be described In the pose to which it commonly ledi e the masthead fosethe Whistlers neck might be elongated and straightened as in the bowsjfrit fosture and held stiffly erect or it might be so shortened and curved that the occiput almost touched the back between the shoulders In either case the bill was invariably well opened and pointed skyward for several seconds during which the head and neck were kept perfectly rigid At the close of this brief period of inaction the bird fre quently uttered its faaaif and kicked up spray but oftener than not I heard no sound and saw no water fly Back thrust of head and neck ending in the fbolded duckskin fosture Some times made from the masthead posture but far oftener directly from the normal position by a single uninterrupted upward and backward swing of the head and neck this movement was so swift and sudden that I often failed to follow it even when watching for it with my attention concentrated on a bird which I felt confi dent was about to make it At its termination the neck lay extended along the back and so very flat and close that it was scarce noticeable The head showed conspicuously enough resting apparently on the occiput at a point anywhere be tween the middle of the back and the rump with the widelyparted mandibles pointing straight upward When in this posture the bird bore a ludicrously close resemblance to a duck skin prepared after the style so much in vogue thirty or28 THE CONDOR Vol XIII forty years ago that is to say with the neck folded over on the back In the skin however the head was differently disposed being placed on its side to save as much vertical space as possible in the cabinet drawer The living bird would ordinarily remain in the attitude just described from half a second to a full second or perhaps two seconds but rarely longer than that At the close of this brief period of inaction the head and neck would swing forward usually less rapidly and abruptly than when carried backward sometimes pausing for a moment when the masthead posture might be taken but as a rule continuing to move without decided halt until the normal position was resumed Rather oftener than not this entire performance was unaccompanied by any sound that reached my ears even when the birds were near at hand but not infrequently the faaaf was heard As nearly as I could ascertain it was given only when the head was raised above the back or shoulders and either moving slowly forward or fixed for an instant perhaps in the masthead position but it was difficult to be sure about this for allowance had to be made for the time required for sound to travel one or perhaps two hundred yards It is possible therefore that the note was occasion ally uttered when the occiput of the bird was still resting on its back or rump but if so I failed to satisfy myself that such was ever the case The best evidence as to the precise instant when the call was emitted was afforded I thought by the shower of water that the bird usually but by no means invariably kicked into the air when calling As nearly as I was able to determine this action either accom panied or very closely followed the production of the vocal note It may be how ever that the interval between the two is longer than my observations have led me to suppose The Whistler drakes often indulged in forms of gesturing or posturing more or less nearly akin to some of those already described yet different in certain re spects Thus they would sometimes take the bowsprit or topmast posture without becoming rigid in it or maintaining it for more than a fraction of a second Fre quently they would dip their bills in the water and then extend them as far for ward or upward as they could well reach at the same time opening and closing their mandibles and quivering their throats as if swallowing rather violently On closely approaching one another or one of the females they often bobbed their heads up and down two or three times in quick succession This seemed to be a form of polite salutation but it may have had a different meaning During most of the more pronounced movements of the head and not infrequently when it was held at rest its feathers were alternately raised or fluffed and depressed or flattened down so that at one instant it looked almost twice and at the next barely one half its usual size This was probably done to show the plumage of the head to the best advantage At least I so concluded as I watched its greenish sheen flash and glimmer in the sunlight and then disappear to blaze out again with renewed lustre a moment later The changes in the adjustment of the feathers of the head resulted also in striking and very interesting variations in its apparent shape When two or more males were showing off in the presence of the females they seemed to perform in a spirit of friendly or at least dispassionate rivalry Not once during the entire morning did I see one of them exhibit any trace of ani mosity or unfriendliness towards another There were no threatening or intimid ating gestures and no apparent desire to interfere with one another in any way even when several males were grouped about a single female Indeed they appeared to be almost wholly absorbed in their attentions to the females and to maintain to wards one another an air of cool yet perfectly polite indifference or aloofness This apparent absence of any sexual jealousy on their part struck me as being very reJan 1911 COURTSHIP OF THE AMERICAN GOLDENEYE 29 markable I wonder if it continues to be absent later in the season when sexual intercourse is near at hand The more elaborate of the ceremonials of courtship above described were seldom if ever performed this morning by solitary males even when accompanied by females nor did they occur when females were absent or far removed Indeed I witnessed them only when at least two or three oftener four or five and some times as many as nine drakes were in rather close association with one or more females Often the males would collect about a female in a rather scattered group and entertain her for minutes at a time by their grotesque actions and peculiar love calls Whenever this happened the female remained for the most part compara tively inactive and apparently quite indifferent to the attentions of her showy ad mirers although she might occasionally single out and obviously encourage one of them by approaching him closely and bobbing her head up and down a few times To this salutation he would immediately respond by a corresponding action before beginning his more elaborate performances again Sometimes the female would suddenly assume the crouching posture which would be instantly imitated by one or more of the males Once I saw a bird which was unquestionably a female first nod next crouch and then take the bowsprit pose This behaviour on her part created intense excitement among the attendant drakes who to the number of at least five or six crowded close about her for a moment but were quickly dispersed I thought by some aggressive movement on her part although the whole thing occurred so quickly that I could not see exactly what happened at the end For nearly half an hour a picturesque line of birds consisting of nine full plumaged males and two females paraded on the glassy water well off shore and about two hundred yards from where I was sitting They swam back and forth over a perfectly straight course three hundred yards and more in length moving slowly but steadily in single file the females close together and ever in the lead the proud drakes following them and each other at intervals varying from six or ten to fifteen or twenty feet Although this orderly procession seldom halted even for an instant the males were almost incessantly posing and bleating and kicking up the little jets of water at their sterns as they glided sedately over the calm surface of the bay Apparently they performed by turns not in any regular order nor at uniform intervals but wholly at haphazard as far as sequence was concerned although each bird seemed to take pains not to begin until his imme diate predecessor had nearly or quite finished The females swam slowly on in ad vance without once turning their heads or giving other evidence that they noted what was happening behind them nevertheless it probably did not escape their close and critical attention for ducks like many other birds can see well enough to the rear when their bills are pointing straight ahead I watched this scene with ab sorbing interest because of its novelty and picturesqueness A small group of Goldeneyes which for a shorter time paraded in a similar manner nearer at hand included three drakes in full nuptial dress and two in immature plumage The latter birds were distinguishable from the single female to which they were paying attention only by their much larger size and by the presence of a few white feathers among their scapulars and on their heads Yet they posed and bleated to her quite as ardently as did the older drakes seeming indeed to have already mastered all the arts and graces of Whistler courtship When not absorbed in watching the courting birds I paid some rather close attention to those which were diving for food As far as I could see and they were very near me at times their wings were always kept tightly closed or folded as long as they remained in sight Their tails were invariably spread to the utmost30 THE CONDOR Vol XIII possible width just as they disappeared As a rule the downward plunge was made without much apparent effort the bird simply immersing its head and then vanish ing with surprising if not mysterious quickness Occasionally however it would spring upwards and forward in the manner of a Grebe or Merganser sometimes showing not only the entire outline of the lower parts of the body above the surface but also the whole of the legs and feet just before reentering the water This may be done to give greater impetus to the descent but I observed that the same bird would sometimes alternate one method with the other during a succession of dives made over exactly the same spot

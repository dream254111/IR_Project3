the burden is upon the wife to show by clear and satisfactory evidence the bona fides of the trans action The presumptions are in favor of the creditors and not in favor of the wife In the case in judgment the wife did not sustain the burden imposed on her Appeal from several decrees pronounced by the Circuit Court of Tazewell county in a suit in chancery wherein the appellee was the complainant and the appellants were the defendants Affirmed The opinion states the case Fulton  Coulling for the appellants Douglas H Smith for the appellees HARRISON J delivered the opinion of the court This appeal is from three decrees of the Circuit Court of Taze well county dated respectively September 8 1899 December 12 1900 and May 27 1901 The court is of opinion that there is no error in the decree of September 8 1899 This litigation had its origin in a contract be tween John G Watts J W Baker and J M Beavers of the first part and C G Hollana of the second part whereby the parties of the first part sold to Holland options upon certain coal lands Two thousand dollars was paid in cash upon condition that if the title was unsatisfactory to Holland it was to be refunded The title did prove unsatisfactory and Holland in an action at law recovered judgment against the parties of the first part for the 2000 he had paid them This judgment in favor of Holland was reviewed by this court and affirmed See lWatts v Holland 86 Va 999 11 S E 1015 In 1896 John G Watts who had been compelled to pay the whole of this judgment filed his bill in the Circuit Court of Tazewell county alleging his payment of the entire judgment the joint and equal liability of J W Baker and J M Beavers to share that bur den with him and asking that he be substituted to all the rights of510 9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Oct C G Holland the judgment creditor and that those equally re sponsible with him be required to make an equitable contribution toward the satisfaction of their joint liability J W Baker and J M Beavers who were made parties defendant to this bill filed a joint and separate answer in which they admit tPe payment by John G Watts of the judgment but deny his right to contribution from them upon the following grounds That some time before the sale of the option to Holland respondents having secured a number of options upon coal lands entered into a parol contract or partnership with the complainant Watts by which he undertook and agreed to sell the options they then had and such as they might thereafter secure to examine and perfect the titles to the lands covered by their options and that each was to have one third of the profits if any arising from the sales made Respon dents aver that complainant failed to perform his part of the con tract by not making reasonable and proper effort to sell the options and by neglecting to have the titles examined and perfected that if complainant had performed his part of the contract the itles would have been satisfactory to C G Holland and that tihe negli gence and default of complainant occasioned the judgmrnt in favor of Holland asserted in the bill and prevented the sale to Holland be ing consummated Respondents further aver that complainant during the con tinuance of the contract or partnership with them without their knowledge or consent formed another partnership of the same kind which directly antagonized and ruined the prospects and suc cess of their contract or partnership that complainant and his new partners are now the owners of valuable coal lands which came into their possession through the labor options and information fur nished by respondents in pursuance of their contract or partner ship that complainant by thus using for the benefit of himself and others options and information furnished by respondents was much more than reimbursed all sums paid to respondents or used in the business growing out of the contract or partnership between them that soon after the refusal of Holland to take the property sold him the same could have been sold to others at a profit sufficient to refund Holland the 2000 cash payment and to have paid respon dents for their time and trouble in securing control of the property but that instead of managing the affairs of the partnership so as to make a profit complainant had used the same for the benefit of19031 BAKER V WAT 511 himself and others whereby he made for himself and occasioned a loss to respondents of a much greater sum than they are indebted to complainant by contribution or by any other means Upon the filing of this answer a motion by the plaintiff for an is sue before a jury to assess the damages claimed by the defendants as an offset was overruled and the cause was referred to a commis sioner to take the evidence and state the necessary accounts to en able the court to determine the issue made by the bill and answer On the 9th day of December 1898 the commissioner filed his re port and with it a mass of evidence much of which was conflicting in which he says From a careful consideration of all the testimony taken and filed in the cause your commissioner is of opinion that the complainant J G Watts is entitled to recover from the de fendants the amounts claimed by him in his pleading On the 8th day of September 1899 the learned judge of the Circuit Court upon mature consideration held that the complainant was en titled to be suibrogated to the lien of the judgment in the bill men tioned overruled the exceptions to the commissioners report con firmed the same and gave a decree in favor of the plaintiff against the defendants for the several sums ascertained by the commissioner to be due from each and gave leave to the plaintiff to amend his bill for the purpose of enforcing his liens From this decree the defendants applied for an appeal and after careful consideration of the record this court being of opinion that the decree appealed from was plainly right refused the appeal The decree of September 8 1899 having settled and determnined the issue between the parties as to the right of the appellee to be subrogated to the lien of the Holland judgment against the appel lants J W Baker and J M Beavers to the extent of their liability to him and this court having affirmed that decree by refusing an appeal therefrom upon the ground that it was plainly right that question is at rest and cannot be reopened The court is further of opinion that there is no error in the de cree of December 12 1900 After an appeal was refused from the decree of September 8 1899 the appellants J W Baker and J MI Beavers presented their joint and separate petition for a rehearing of the lastnamed decree upon the ground of afterdiscovered evi dence It is an established rule that before allowing a petition for re hearing or bill of review to be filed on the ground of afterdis512 9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Oct covered evidence the court must be satisfied that the evidence relied on is new and could not by ordinary diligence have been discov ered prior to the date of the decree complained of Craufurds Admnr v Snmiths Exr 93 Va 628 23 S E 235 25 S E 657 A petition to rehear a chancery suit which does not allege the dis covery of new and imiportant testimony not known or accessible to the petitioner before the former hearing and which points out no error upon the face of the former decree should be dismissed Woods v Early 95 Va 307 28 S E 374 In the case at bar the petition undertakes to review the evidence upon which the decree of September 8 1899 is based and closes with this single allegation with respect to afterdiscovered evidence Your petitioners now here state that the element of profit lacking in the evidence in this cause cannot be supplied and that after said cause was submitted to your honor the complainant your petition ers are advised believe and charge sold said properties to one T B Houston at the rate of 15 per acre and that a large part of the purchase price has been paid to the complainant There is no allegation in the petition that the evidence suggested by the language quoted was not known and could not by the exer cise of reasonable diligence have been discovered before the date of the decree sought to be reheard This was necessary under the authorities and leave to file the petition was properly denied The court is further of opinion that there is no error in the de cree of May 27 1901 That decree is based upon the amended bill and the proceedings thereunder leave to file which was reserved to the appellee by the decree of September 8 1899 for the purpose of enabling him to enforce the lien of the Holland judgment to which he had been subrogated The amended bill alleged that the de fendants had since the date of the Holland judgment in order to hinder delay and defraud the complainant in the enforcement of his lien made certain alienations of their property and asked that such alienees be made parties defendant and the property of the judgment debtors be subjected to the satisfaction of his lien There are but two questions arising under these proceedings that we are called upon to notice The appellant Fannie E Baker wife of defendant J W Baker complains of the action of the court in decreeing a sale of five shares of stock in the Tazewell Improvement Company wllich had been transferred to her by her husband J W Baker and directing the proceeds of such sale to be applied to the1903 PEERY V ELLIOTT 513 debt of the complainant Transactions between husband and wife must be fair and honest and not mere contrivances resorted to for the purpose of placing the husbands property beyond the reach of his creditors and in a contest between the creditors of the husband and the wife the burden of proof is upon her to show by clear and satisfactory evidence the bona fides of the transaction In all such cases the presumptions are in favor of the creditors and not in favor of the wife Flynn v Jackson 93 Va 341 25 S E 1 Spence v Repass 94 Va 716 27 S E 583 In the case at bar Mirs Baker has not sustained the burden the law imposes upon her The evidence does not establish that the five shares of stock were purchased with her means on the contrary it appears to have been an assignment to the wife without consideration and the stock was properly subjected to the husbands debt There was no error in the action of the court in decreeing a sale of part of the real estate claimed by the defendant J W Baker as a homestead This assignment of error has not been pressed in ar gument and it satisfactorily appears from the evidence that the homestead claim was largely in excess of the value allowed by statute and that the value of the property remaining in the hands of the defendant is the full measure of his rights as a homestead claimant For these reasons the decrees complained of must be affirmed 4ffirmed

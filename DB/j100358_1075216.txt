j100358,The School Review,1075216,French as a Substitute for Latin,i244566,FRENCH AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR LATIN BEHIND the endless discussion of courses textbooks and methods lurks the fundamental problem too often overlooked by zealous disputants What is the proper place of our study in the system of education in what way is it to benefit the pupil The general question applies to Germanor in fact to any other topicas well as to French but the answer differs more or less according to the nature of the subject In our case the reply to the inquiry is by no means obvious We may dismiss at once the familiar utilitarian response and we may do so without engaging in the farreaching debate as to whether our secondary schools should afford apprenticeship in the arts and crafts French is no more practical than Greek Even under the most favorable conditions the linguistic attain ments of ordinary scholars are absolutely worthless from the commercial standpoint And were they much higher than they are what would be the native youths chance of success in com petition with the hosts of bilingual hyphenated Americans The plea that the possession of a strange tongue is essential to the enjoyment of travel or that it is often convenient for inter course with foreigners at home is too frivolous to merit consid eration On such grounds a better case could be made for dancing as a highschool study nearly all pupils are likely to have opportunities to dance but not one in fifty will see Europe or be called upon to entertain a European If we wish to be taken seriously we must point to real advantages and if we can find none let us at least save our selfrespect by withdrawing from the contest The inferior position occupied by French in the educational world is due to its constant association with trivialities For some two thousand years the worlds greatest minds have been formed by the discipline of Latin All through the Middle Ages the Renaissance and in modern times almost down to our own recollection Latin grammar was the one instrument of 462FRENCH AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR LATIN 463 mental training Latin literature the chief aesthetic stimulant When we look back over the centuries and consider all the mighty intelligences that fed upon this sturdy diet we begin to waver in our acceptance of latterday substitutes and to demand that the pedagogical Grape Nuts and Sunny Jims show us some thing more convincing than advertisements Nothing however is more evident than that the good old meat is little by little to be discontinued The marvelous expansion of knowledge the transformation of life and thought have already relegated Greek so far to the background that the word Attic to the new generation suggests only the musty unexplored recesses of the storeroom And however bitterly we regret it no matter how fiercely our heroic broom oppose the rising tide we are destined as far as human foresight can discernto see Latin slowly dislodged to make room for new and untried idols Let us look to it that the new gods be not too inferior to the old That they shall at once be equal is not to be expected we must resign ourselves for some time to come to the prospect of youth inadequately trained The three leading aspirants to Latins ferule are mathematics natural science and modern languages The first member of this pantheon is not altogether a stranger Mathematics is a timehonored handmaid to the classics and in this capacity has done good service inculcating accuracy and concentration More than this it cannot do Its narrowness its remoteness from human interest unfit it for a leading part The best conceivable mathematician we are dis cussing of course only the elementary branches is a machine and a study whose highest object is mechanical perfection while most useful as an ancillary discipline is dehumanizing if per mitted to usurp the central place The most we can wish for mathematics is that it keep its traditional honorable position What are the claims of natural science It trains the eye the hand it makes us familiar with natural forces and the lower forms of life it brings us into close communion with the macrocosm that surrounds us in other words it develops those powers and instincts that are characteristic of the savage Now it may be that mankind has grown too bookish too introspective464 THE SCHOOL REVIEW that a partial reversion to barbarism is not untimely So much one may willingly admit But a return to savagery can hardly constitute the whole onward march of civilization The pursuit of natural science however interesting and wholesome it may be can never to the slightest degree replace the humanities With the incursion of scientific subjects into the curriculum the old type of college graduate disappears and the distinction between the educated and the illiterate ceases to be apparent The purely  scientific  university man can sometimes command a higher salary than his unlettered brother but his speech manners and interests are apt to be essentially those of the rude mechanical No one would dream of asserting that the scientific expert is necessarily devoid of cultivation  hundreds of examples could instantly be cited in rebuttal but he seeks and finds the refining influence outside of his specialty While we cannot without reversing our whole ideal of edu cation make natural science the backbone of our system we may be certain it will henceforth remain a conspicuous member Man is both flesh and spirit and we can no longer close our eyes to the importance of the material universe The excessively monastic character of the old erudition will doubtless be corrected by an infusion of healthy realism Another study of great and growing popularity which how eyer has not yet clamored for pedagogical hegemony obtains due recognition in the modern curriculum history is doubly assured of permanence through its intrinsic interest and through its affinity to literature it is an indispensable concomitant both to the classics and to modern languages It is now becoming evident that the leading discipline what ever be its nature will never enjoy the exclusive rights nor hold the despotic sway so long exercised by Latin In fact the new education will be invertebrate it will lack the closely knit harmonious symmetrical structure of the old school Some compensation for this lost consistency will perhaps be found in broadened sympathy and a firmer grasp of reality However this may be it cannot be denied that unless we are prepared to change utterly our conception of civilization we must look toFRENCH AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR LATIN 465 some study for a part at least of the peculiar benefits heretofore conferred by Latin and it is equally true that these can be afforded neither by mathematics nor by natural science nor it may be added by history If for lack of a worthier competitor the mantle of the classics seems likely to fall upon modern languages let it be worn with dignity and a becoming sense of responsibility Our first duty is to ascertain what may be expected of us what may be the duties of our new office The inquiry must be addressed to the late incumbent What did Latin do for the boy which no other study could accomplish Aside from the admirable mnemonic exercise afforded by inflections and vocabulary Latin grammar teaches observation and judgment Latin style develops the artistic instinct Latin literature reveals the nobler aspects of human nature The functions of case tense and mood form an ample course in philosophy there can be no better lesson in logic than the disentangling of a Latin period classical art is the basis of our aesthetic ideals Roman history is the worlds fountainhead of patriotism ancient literature has been for ages our chief textbook of psychology How much of all this can a modern language impart Not all but a large share and if it has never been done hitherto the failure has been due not to the subject but to the teacher The modern language to be sure labors under a grave disadvantage It has not the authority with which ancient privilege invests the classics The introduction to Goethe and Victor Hugo is accompanied by none of the glorious circumstance with which the boy is ushered into the awful pres ence of Virgil or Cicero On the other hand the living tongue profits by the keen interest attaching to anything that is alive it is besides more easily approached and better understood At this point the question arises Which of the two languages French and German is the more competent to take the place of an ancient tongue On the mnemonic side German offers the superior attractions In grammar too at first sight it seems more akin to Latin but on closer consideration French with its greater delicacy its finer distinctions and its subtler logic appears better adapted than the more crudely mechanical German to466 THE SCHOOL REVIEW genuine intellectual exercise Furthermore the German alpha bet besides unduly taxing the eyes forms a vexatious and utterly unprofitable obstacle to the beginner It must be admitted how ever that French is far more difficult to teach In literature there can hardly be a comparison while German has a copious store of pretty and wholesome tales for children and cain boast of a few great books for older minds French the most artistic of modern languages presents as soon as the elementary stage is passed an abundance a variety a consecutive stream of mas terpieces which we should seek in vain on the other side of the Rhine It should be remembered too that excepting the period of the early Renaissance France has been from the birth of the vulgar tongues the literary center of Europe more than any other land it inherits the prestige of ancient Greece and Rome Nevertheless the choice will doubtless always be determined largely by local and personal considerations Whichever be the foreign language selected both its labors and its responsibilities will be shared by English Especially on the literary and aesthetic side the mothertongue will be an invaluable ally for strictly disciplinary purposes it is ill adapted Between the two languages there must be constant and hearty cooperation it is only through a genuine union of these two instruments that we can hope to rival the pedagogical success of Latin After the preliminary stagedevoted to pronunciation and the rudiments of vocabulary inflections and syntaxshould come a thorough course in comparative grammar the relation between thought and its modes of expression the real significance of case tense and mood the logic of construction the philosophy of idiom should be minutely and intelligently examined in the two languages and the pupil should be led to see how the same object is attained in different ways in the speech of different countries When the student is far enough advanced careful translation to and fro should be used to illustrate not only the correspondences and the divergences of grammar and idiom but also the niceties of expression and the canons of style The French or German reading should be so chosen as to supple ment the scholars literary work in English it should all be ofFRENCH AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR LATIN 467 a character to arouse and cultivate the artistic sense and at the same time afford the substantial meat upon which growing minds ought to feed An intelligent properly equipped French teacher who really respects his office if allowed a fair opportunity in the way of time and books is bound to accomplish something that will make his subject worthy of respect He will constantly ask himself whether he is doing the thing that will be of most lasting benefit to his pupils He will compare his results not with those of the linguistic mountebank but with those of the best classical instruc tion Slovenliness halfknowledge intellectual sloth will be the objects of his unremitting warfare His measure of accomplish ment will not be the number of pages covered but the extent and value of the information and experience which his pupils have obtained If we can secure such teaching as thishalf sub merged though we be under the present wave of materialism we need not be too despondent about the future something of the old discipline will survive and the international brotherhood of educated men which once found its expression in the use of a common tongue will reveal itself in mutual understanding and mutual sympathy C H GRANDGENT HARVARD UNIVERSITY Cambridge Mass

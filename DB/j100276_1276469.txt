notice was not raised but the point was confined to whether the restriction was inserted for the benefit of the plaintiffs lots Such an intention may appear from the nature of the restriction or from the situation of the property and the surrounding circumstances Peck v Conway 119 Mass 546 Peabody Heights Co v Wilson 82 Md 186 Coughlin v Barker 46 Mo App 54 Muzzarelli v Hulzhizer 163 Pa St 643 Such an intention will be presumed if it appears that the lots were laid out to be sold under a general building scheme with the grantor retaining none of the land Nottingham Pat Brick  Tile Co v Butler i6 Q B Div 778 Parker v Nightingale 6 Allen Mass 341 Spicer v Martin 14 App Cas 12 Sharp v Ropes supra In the instant case the court found that there was no general plan or building scheme The principal case is not the or dinary situation where the owner of a tract of land sells part of it subject to restrictions and the purchaser of the part retained seeks to enforce the restriction but the land sold subject to the covenants has been divided and sold to different purchasers some of whom now seek to enforce the re strictions against another Winfield v Henning 21 N J Eq I88 seems to be the only case allowing the plaintiff to enforce restrictions on such a state of facts It has been declared to be bad law Dana v Wentworth iii Mass 29I and is probably wrong According to the weight of authority there is no cause of action in such a situation Dana v Wentworth supra Jezwll v Lee 14 Allen Mass 145 Korn v Campbell 192 N Y 490 Gra ham4 v Hite 93 Ky 474 Wille v St John L R I9IO I Chan 84 DIVORCEATTACHMENT OF PERSON FOR COSTS AND ATTORNEYS FEESSuit for divorce by husband against wife was dismissed with counsel fee and costs and defendant moves to attach petitioner for nonpayment Held counsel fee and costs allowed in a final decree may be enforced by a process of attachment for contempt Letts v Letts N J Eq I9I6 96 Atl 887 The practice of requiring the husband to provide his wife with means to defend a divorce suit and to support her while it is pending had its origin in the principle that at common law the husband having by the marriage contract the control of the wifes property she was destitute of means for her own protection The general rule has been modified by state statutes giving to married women property rights but the quality of the duty upon which it arose is undiminished Marker v Marker II N J Eq 256 This allowance may be enforced by attachment for con tempt or execution or when the husband is plaintiff the court can make the payment a condition to the further prosecution of the suit Waters v Waters 49 Mo 385 Ormsby v Ormsby I Phila Pa 578 This allow ance is in the nature of alimony and the means open to enforce alimony are available to enforce the order for costs and expenses The grounds for these allowances are indeed indistinguishable whether made for sup port solely or to carry on or defend the suit Both are equally within the discretion of the chancellor and subject to his sole power of enforce 686RECENT IMPORTANT DECISIONS ment BIDDLE DIVORCE I70 In Kentucky the court held that the attorneys fees and other costs ordered to be paid in divorce proceedings made abor tive by the wifes death could be enforced in a summary way by attach ment and imprisonment Ballard v Caperton 59 Ky 412 In New York it is held that the costs of an action for divorce cannot be collected by proceedings to punish for contempt Jacquin v Jacquin 36 Hun N Y 378 Weil v Weil Io N Y Supp 627 Branth v Branth 13 N Y Supp 360 These cases are all based upon the Civil Code of Procedure of that state and they appear to be in conflict with the case of Park v Park 80 N Y 156 affirming Park v Park I8 Hun N Y 466 wherein it is said that the claim that the attachment should be vacated because it was based upon the refusal of the defendant to pay the costs of the suit is sufficiently answered by the fact that it was issued for disobedience of the order of the court In many of the states statutes have been passed permit ting the court to enforce the payment of its decrees for alimony coun sels fees and costs by orders and executions and proceedings as in case of contempt See Staples v Staples 87 Wis 592 and note thereto in 24 L R A 433 439 collecting the statutes and decisions thereunder EXECUTORS AND ADMINISTRATORSRIGHT OF SETOFFIn an action by the administrators of the insolvent estate of the deceased against a bank for the amount of money which the deceased had on deposit to his credit Held That the bank could set off against this claim the amount of a note of the deceased held by it although the note had not yet matured Conquest v Broadway National Bank Tenn I916 183 S W I6o SHANNONS CODE  4137 provides that in cases similar to the principal case the defendant might plead a setoff of whatever amount is due him from the deceased in an action by the administrator But at the time this action was brought there was no amount due from the deceased to the bank A strict construction of the statute would therefore lead to a different result from that reached in the principal case It is true that the deceased was admittedly insolvent

matter but failed to obtain any very definite information According to the reports of the common people many caverns were explored by Lund and his assistants in person for the express purpose of collecting fossils while others were worked by the people of the vicinity for saltpetre who under instructions from Lund and probably as far as possible under his supervision saved the fossils disinterred in their operations I could learn nothing as to the conditions under which the human skull now in the museum at Rio de Ja neiro and stated to have been found with remains of extinct mammals was met with More definite and apparently reliable information was given in regard to a complete human skeleton which was one of a lot sent to Copenhagen A workman in one of the saltpetre caves at some distance from Lagoa Santa found the skeleton in his work and to gain the reward offered took it to Lund who gave him the sum of forty milreis about twenty dollars This man is still alive but from lack of time I was unable to see him It is said that on his recent visit to Minas the emperor had an interview with him on the subject Recently while in New York I had the good fortune to meet Mr Nicholas Brandt son of the late Prof P A Brandt who was for many years the secretary and companion of Dr Lund Mr Brandt who had spent some time at Lagoa Santa in company with his father and Dr Lund kindly gave me the follow ing note The remains of the prehistoric man discovered by Dr Lund in Minas before I came to Brazil and about which the professor sent his memoirs to the Instituto historico e geographico of Rio de Janeiro in January 1842 and April 1844 were often the subjects of our conversation The doctors opinion was positive that the skeletons be longed to the same period as the fossil fauna with which he enriched the knowledge of natural history to such a large extent The opinion of Cuvier and Humboldt Dr Lunds friends was fully justified in urging the doctor to go to Brazil and use his energies in the service of this branch of science The doctor was of course a pure follower of his friend Cuvier Darwin and Darwinism were at that time hardly heard of as his Blikpaa Braseliens Dyreverden fully shows Mr Brandt adds that but for the loss of all his private papers including his Brazilian journal and many letters from his father and Dr Lund in the Atlantic disaster some years ago he would have been able to give a much more definite and detailed ac count of Lunds life and work at Lagoa Santa ORVILLE A DERBY LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Solar constant THIS term is becoming prominent and its use has given rise to some confusion I find some au thorities taking the value given by Forbes give 282 calories while others give 282 calories Since a ca lorie is the definite amount of heat required to raise a kilogram of water 1 C it is evident that one of these is in error Professor Young in his Sun p 263 defines the solar constant as the amount of heat received per minute by one square metre exposed perpendicularly to the suts rays at the upper surface of the atmos phere No mention is made of the substance receiving the heat In correspondence with Professor Young I have received the following equation the solar con NCE VOL I No 19 Ew t stant s X  in which w  mass of water s  surface t  quantity of heat m  unit of time On this basis we may define the solar constant as the amount of heat received in a unit of time by a unit of mass spread upon a unit of surface exposed as above In this equation however we may divide w by s and obtain d  depth and we shall have the dx t solar constant    ie the solar constant equals the quantity of heat received from the sun at the limit of the earths atmosphere by a unit of depth of water in a unit of time We may express this numerically as follows take a square metre and spread upon it a kilogram of water it will lie 1 mm deep Since the kilogram is the unit used in defining the calorie we may say using Forbess value that the solar constant 282 ca lories is the amount of heat received by 1 mm depth of water exposed as above The use of the term  ca lorie seems unfortunate and we might adopt as more satisfactory a centimetre as the unit of depth and degrees as expressing heat We would then have the solar constant equal to 282 Centigradecentimetre minute degrees or 282 ccm0 ie the suns heat falling upon a centimetre depth of water would raise it 282 C in one minute This will be recognized as of the same form of ex pression as adopted by Herschel who describes the suns heat as sufficient to melt a coating of ice an inch thick in 2 h 13 m nearly H A HAZEN Spanish folklore In the account of folklore in Europe in SCIENCE for May 25 I see no notice of Spanish efforts in that field My acquaintance with the subject is but slight yet it has extended to the important and interesting works of Antonio de Trueba who in 1873 spoke of himself as almost the only writer of our country who has given himself with any diligence to this task the collection of popular stories especially now that the illustrious Fernan Caballero rests from his most glorious labors The method of Trueba dif fers from that of the brothers Grimm for example in that he adds the polish of his admirable style to the rough form of the stories as they fall from the mouth of the people such a process being necessary he maintains in order to fit them for a place among the products of the literary art I subjoin a list of his publications in this department Cuentos de color de rosa Cuentos campesinos

times large seals have been seen or taken on the coast of Massachusetts and although in no case positively identified presumed to be exam ples of the crested seal Cystophora cristata mainly because a specimen of this species described long since by Dr DeKay was taken in 1824 in a small creek emptying into Long Island Sound at East Chester about fifteen miles from NewYork City As two other large seals  the gray seal Halichoerus grypus and the bearded seal Erignathus barbatus are almost as likely to occur on the NewEngland coast as this one it is some satisfaction to be able to record the capture of a wellidentified example of the crested seal in Newburyport harbor May 2 1882 Mr E C Greenwood of Ipswich by whom the specimen was secured and mounted informs me that yJUNE 15 1883 SCOIE it was a fine adult male eight feet in length weigh ing very nearly one thousand pounds The speci men was purchased by Dr G E Manigault for the museum at Charleston SC where it is now pre served That this species is prone to wander far from its usual haunts the icefields eastward of Newfound land and northward  is attested by its capture not only near NewYork City but also at Cambridge Md in an arm of Chesapeake Bay as recorded some twenty years ago by Professor Cope The present record however is the first of the capture of a posi tively identified example of any seal on the New England coast other than the common small harbor seal Phoca vitulina J A ALLEN Flight of the flyingfish On a recent trip from New York to Galveston with the weather at the start cold and chilly wind northeast and ending in the Gulf with clear sunny days and summer breezes there was every oppor tunity afforded for watching the flight of flyingfish The first fish were seen two days out of New York and on every day thereafter save on one when off the coast of Florida numerous brown pelicans were observed Probably the flyingfish found the atmos phere a trifle heavy flitting about with pelicans for interested spectators and attended strictly to their domestic duties The act of flying is somewhat startling the fish emerging with much energy and from the very start buzzing its wings like ahummning bird and in no instance did the buzzing cease until the fish disappeared in the sea at the end of its flight The longest flight observed continued without any contact with the water for nine seconds estimated distance six hundred to eight hundred feet In some cases the flight was nearly horizontal in most cases however it was arched vertically Flying across the wind it was noticed that contact with the water did not apparently retard the movement of the fish in the air Some of them made four contacts before finishing the flight The wind had some effect upon the direction and character of the flying but fish were noticed going with the Wilnd and cross ing it in every direction and a few flying directly B L  A 3 A B A B A against it A being the startingpoints B the end and the line of

SCIENCE p 395 to the assumption that the dissi pation of solar energy from loss of lieat diminishes the supply of sunheat received by the earth has NCE 543 overlooked the very important factor of the variable area of the contracting sun To make this clear let Q Quantity of heat incident normally on a unit surface in a unit of time at the earths dis tance from the sun B Radiating or heatemitting power of each physi cal point of the sun A Area of projected surface emitting heat normally  Area of great circle of sun regarded as a sphere Then evidently at a given distance we have Q varies as R x A hence taking the example cited from New comb as A varies directly as the square of the suns diameter if the temperature of the condensed gas eous mass is doubled by contraction to onehalf its primitive diameter its area or A would be reduced to onefourth its original area so that notwith standing the assumed augmentation of temperature of the sun the supply of heat received by the earth or RxA would not be increased unless B aug mented in a ratio greater than the square of the temperature It is difficult to assign precisely what function B is of the temperature of the radiating body some physicists Rossetti make it propor tional to the square of the absolute temperature while others Stephan make it as high as the fourth power of the absolute temperature JOHN LECONTE Sphere anemometer I am rather amused to see in SCIENCE p 228 that Dr Sprung of Hamburg has reinvented an ane mometer well known but not used in this country viz HEwletts Dr Sprung and all who wish to help forwards our knowledge of windforce should begin by making themselves acquainted with what has already beern done In the Quarterly journal of the meteorological society viii p 161 will be found an Historical sketch of anemometry and anemometers by J K Laughton MA FRGS president mete orological society and in it will be found notices of about two hundred patterns The full description of HIIowletts is given in the Proceedings British meteoro logical society iv p 161 but even Howlett was not the first to use the sphere for in Mr Laughtons address he remarks  The sphere as a pressureplate at the end of a swinging rod had been suggested and possibly used many years before Mr IHowletts time as a rude anemoscope It is mentioned vaguely by Hiilse  Allgemeine maschinen encyclopddie under anemometer in 1841 and is said by Mr Bender Proc inst civil engineers March 14 1882 to have been used by Parrot but this I have not been able to verify G J SYMoNS FRS 62 Camden

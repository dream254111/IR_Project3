j100195,The Jewish Quarterly Review,1450969, The ryan Words in the Old Testament IV ,i263209,THE ARYAN WORDS IN THE OLD TESTAMENT BY W ST CLAIR TISDALL Bedford Beds England IV WE now come to Persian words in the HebrewAramaic text which haveor seem at first sight to haveas their first element the prefixes fra and ham Having dealt with these we shall be able to go on to consider certain other supposed Persian vocables which in reality are not such I Infra Avestic and Achaemenian  Greek 7rpo Lat pro German vor Eng fore there seems to occur only the word 1ln in Dan I 3 6 Esther  3 6 9 The B D B Lexicon rightly regards this as the plural of the word which in Avestic isfratema foremost superlative of fra As a noun it means chief leader In Achaemenian the word is fratama first fratamna mnartiyd  leading men Dahvyundm fratemodhdto in Yasht X x8  praepositus praefectus provinciarum  The certainty of this derivation has recently been proved by the occurrence of the com parative of the same word fra in the Elephantine papyri Fratama fratema Skt pralama is the superlative of fra and its comparative in Avestic is fratara In Sachaus Drei aramdische Papyrus Urkunden I 5 occurs lnnm which would befrataraka in either dialect of Old Persian The ka is an adjectival termination compare prathamaka  foremost in Sanskrit not here a diminutive and the word is rendered prefect VOL IV 97 HI98 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW II In ham Avestic hcm c Skt sam Gk evv rvv Lat cum together with we find three words 7n wn and Knlrn i The first of these WDn occurs in the plural Aram of Dan 2 5 3 29 and is rightly explained in B D B as from the Persian word which in Mediaeval times was handam and is now andam It now means the body but it formerly meant also a limb But we can trace the word farther back In the Avesta it is handdma a limb It does not occur in the Achaemenian inscriptions as yet found The word comes from ham together and da to put make Skt sam dha It was taken into Syriac as well as into Aramaic and is there hadddma limb haddem to dismember In Arabic it comes to mean symmetry stature handam The assimilation of the n to the d in Syr and Aram is common enough in other words In Modern Persian andam zadan or anddm anddm kardan in Armenian andam hoshel means to dismember just as the equivalent phrase in Daniel does 2 The word I Dan 5 7 x6 29 is variously read The received text has zin and ir7 Ginsburg gives also the Ketib form KTr Andreas reads tsn The Syriac word is hamnkd and the Targ has 1D In the Talmud the forms qnt pI and P occur The latter word is borrowed from the Greek form MAavatdKrY used in Dan by the LXX and Theodotion MavLaKrs is used by Polybius to denote the Celts torques armlet necklet  The meaning of the word in Dan is evidently necklace as has long been known but what is its etymology The B D B Lexicon suggests that the word in its simple and indefinite form should be read hamydnak and that it is a diminutive of the Persian hamydn But hamydn isTHE ARYAN WORDS IN OLD TESTAMENTTISDALL 99 merely the modern Persian pronunciation of the modern Arabic himynn which is a genuine Arabic derivative of the Arabic verb hama to fall c and means i a loin cloth 2 a girdle 3 a purse hanging from the girdle Arabic words taken into modern Persian do very occasion ally take the Persian diminutive ak But we lack proof that Arabic vocables had won an entrance into Old Persian and there undergone such a change The derivation of Tnn however is really quite clear In Avestic we have a word maini Skt mant an ornament and specially a necklace In the Avesta a vulture with a golden collar zarenumaini is mentioned Combining this with the prefix ham  together we should have in Avestic hammaini which in Achaemenian would be hammani The ka termination is usual enough not always having a diminutive sense see above Hence the Achaemenian form of the word used in Daniel would be hammanika a collection of necklets a neckchain probably therefore pn or Tan in the Masoretic text is right The Targ form 13 is derived from the same word mani maini with the ka but without the prefix In Armenian the word maneak a necklace occurs this being the natural form of the vocable in that tongue From this came the Greek loanword AavLrKis also tzaviaKov The other forms in Greek Ldvvos dAvoS Flovos are possibly loanwords from Persian or possibly original like the Latin monile In any case they are from the same root as mani In Avestic the forms mina and minu necklace also occur hence the derivative verb manel to twist spin weave in Armenian 3 The third word snns is the proper name of a city H2I00 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW but none the less the same prefix ham enters into its composition It has a prosthetic N the n is an early error for n and a final t is lost All this is clear from comparing the different forms in which the name is found The Peshitta has Ahmdtan the LXX AuaOda Tiglath Pileser about 1100 BC writes it Amaddna and the Talmud has tpi This is of course the city of Hamadan in Persia Dr Driver and some others write it with the hard Arabic h equivalent to the Heb n But I have never met it so written in Persian Hamdan with the h is the name of an Arabian tribe the Ban Hamdan having no connexion with 3nr Darius Besitun Inscription II 768 writes the name Hangmatdna It comes from ham together the root gam to go and a termination denoting the place where anything is done hence it means the place of holding a hangama modern anjuman or assembly The formn Ay3adrava used by Herodotus is more correct than the more common Greek EK37rava III This is perhaps the best place to deal with two proper names of men Haman and Hammedatha though they have no connexion with the root ham i Haman trn Esther 3 I c c The B D B Lexicon says that the etymology is dubious but on Jensens authority suggests that the word is the name of the Elamite god IHumban or Humman Surely we should not accept such a most unlikely derivation until we are quite certain that no simple Persian source can be found from which the name can come In this case however the explanation and derivation are quite evident Haman is the Avestic word human nom sing from hu Skt su Gk ev well and man to think Achaemenian Sanskrit and Avestic alike whence Lat mens Gk vos Skt Zmaas cTHE ARYAN WORDS IN OLD TESTAMENTTISDALL IOI Hence zhmanE means welldisposed Skt sumaznas Gk EvuEvrj As an appellation in its Greek form the word is fairly well known In the Masoretic text only the vowels need be changed 2 Hamans fathers name was Hammedatha nlnl Esther 3 i c The B D B Lexicon suggests that this is from maha a month and ddta given  i e Moongiven  and compares the forms Masbdrnj Mabaras MasbrnT But it would be difficult to account for the first syllable in this wayin fact impossible The name is doubtless Homadata which in Avestic would be Haomaddta Skt Somadatta  created by Haoma Haoma was the yazata of the haoma plant which corresponds in the form of its name to the Sanskrit Sormaplant Somadatta is a name which not unfrequently occurs in Sanskrit With Haomaddta compare Mithradcta MLOpaBaTdr created by Mithra The ao in Avestic presupposes an au or o in Achaemenian Persian hence doubtless Homadata is the name we need in the nom Homaddto would be a common form That the haoma or its Genius should be thus honoured will not seem strange to students of the Avesta compare the worship of the Soma in Vedic times Tradition says that Zoroaster Zarathustra was born to reward his father Pourushaspa for making copious libations of haoma IV We come now to deal with some words which are not really Persian though they have been thought to belong to that language Perhaps we should here remind our readers that loanwords in the HebrewAramaic text of the Bible if derived from Persian cannot have come from the shortened and corrupted forms in use in the modern language for these were not yet in existence at the time when the Biblical books were written They must have102 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW been derived from either Avestic or Achaemenian Persian Hence it is unscientific to compare modern Persian words with them unless we are sure that these have not been altered since ancient days The modern word Shah a king was in Achaemenian times Khshyaiythiya hence to suggest that any Biblical word comes from the form Shah would be absurd just as it would be to say that the Italian selvatico is taken from the French sauvage or the Arabic kamns from the French chemise instead of from the Latin silva and camisia respectively i Bearing this in mind let us examine the proposed etymology of the word 1n  found in the plural n5l in Nahum 2 4 Heb It is now usually rendered steel The B D B says its origin is dubious but doubtfully gives Lagardes suggestion that it comes from the Persian pzlad with that meaning But this derivation is impossible for the simple reason that pulad is a corruption of an older and longer form and did not exist in its present shape when Nahum wrote In Armenian steel is poghopat poghovat Now gh in Armenian represents an antique 1 so we get the old forms polopat and polovat From either of these especially the latter the Modern Persian pilad is derived unless both languages take the word from an ancient Persian word In the latter case as Old Persian had no I another rea son against Lagardes proposed etymology the word would probably be pourupat or pouruvat the a being short or long Pouru in Avestic isparu in Achaemenian Greek 7roAi Sktpuru Germ voll ourfull pat may be from the same root as the Sanskrit patu sharp or from the root pat found in Avestic and Sanskrit with such meanings as to fall to fly c cf 7reTavvvtz petere Vat may be the Avestic root vad vadh Skt vadh to wound toTHE ARYAN WORDS IN OLD TESTAMENTTISDALL 103 hurt whence Avestic vadare weapon blow Very sharp or much smiting might describe steel not amiss However this may be the fact that steel in Nahums time was not called pulad in Persian but pJourupat puruvat or in Achaemenian if we may similarly reconstruct the word parupat paruvat shows that Nahums n15Z cannot come from pulad whatever its etymology may be But is there any need for such a search Is it not simpler to suppose that n13 is for either ninB agreeing with tWK or ninb referring to n In either case this amounts merely to the suggestion that Nahum substitutes 5 for I in a wellknown Hebrew verb He indulges in several departures from the usual practice in vv 4 and 5 in any case If with Wellhausen and Nowack we read eNO for W3 we may render n nS W32 like fire flash the chariots as the Russian version does Or reading nflb we have like flashing fire are the chariots In Assyrian the root Nnt means to be bright while paradu means to be impetuous to hasten This seems better than to invent a word to mean steel for which no proper etymology can be found The puzzle afforded by n2S is an ancient one The LXX guessed that it meant reins fjviat and the Vulgate follows suit The Peshitta conjectured that the word should be nm torches but this occurs just below The Mesidot Davd takes the same view Rashi mentions this idea but admits he does not know what rnif means The Targum has lM llnnn 5mn Nnftf which seems to mean with fire are the elephants of their warchariots prepared truly a remarkable idea It may be noted that though 51 is usually masc sing yet Nahum makes the collective noun plural feminine by104 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW his use of thefern plur pronominal suffix in ver 5 nap  teir appearance This justifies our suggestion that nM5T should be punctuated nhSi as a fer plur present Participle It may be noticed that Luthers version completely agrees with this view rendering Seine Wagen leuchten wie Feuer There is really no necessity however to change the Masoretic w into t3 for the former suits the sense quite as well z In Deut 33 2 occurs the strange word which in the Masoretic text is read nIM and which used to be rendered a fire of law a fiery law This rendering took n1 for the Old Persian data which occurs in later books but would hardly be expected in Deut The B D B Lexicon admits that this is erroneous and gives various suggested correc tions of the text which we need not discuss According to Ginsburg the Ket7b has n  We need not try to trace an Aryan etymology for the word but it may not be out of place to investigate its meaning and derivation There seem to be two possible derivations each of which appears to give a not unsuitable sense i Ancient Egyptian has the word ist seat throne place which comes from a Semitic root w1 whence in Arabic we have isadah asadah  cushion wisadah wasadah cushion pillow couch throne and in the Targum in i Kings o1 I9 nTw stays arms of a throne is used for the Heb n1iF If derived from this root nrw in Deut would mean  seat throne and we should render At His right hand there is a seat for them cf the Heb lt founda tion in Assyrian isdu 2 The other possible derivation is the root which in Aramaic is 1e to pour out It occurs in Syriac too where edd dma means effusion of blood In Assyrian from this root comes adietu MussTHE ARYAN WORDS IN OLD TESTAMENTTISDALL IO5 Arnolt p IoI7 grace favour If we accept this view we should render the text At His right hand there is grace for them In either case there seems to be no need of deeming the text corrupt and adopting conjectural emendations The ancient versions and commentators render no real help The Targum has The book of His right hand gave us instruction from the midst of the fire The LXX have CK betLv avrov ayyeXoLt FrE avrov The Peshitta renders And with Him from myriads of His saints at His right hand He gave to them The Vulgate has a fiery law and even Ibn Ezra and Rashi accept

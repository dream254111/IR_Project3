Pittsburgh District I C WHITE The Appalachian coal field begins near the northern line of Pennsylvania and ex tends in a canoeshaped trough 900 miles southwestward ending in western Ala bama Pittsburgh is situated near the cen ter of the northern end of this great basin and has therefore easy access to all of the coal formations To one of these beds the great Pitts burgh seam which overlooks the city from an elevation of 350 feet and extends up the Monongahela for 200 miles the indus trial supremacy of the region is largely due Several years ago the gifted Blaine pre dicted that the Pittsburgh district would in time become the manufacturing center of the world because of its command of cheap fuel This prophecy has become a reality within less than a decade of its ut terance The Monongahela formation of which the Pittsburgh coal is the basal member caps all the hills around the city and stretches away to the south up the river which gave the beds a name to be in turn covered up by the Dunkard formation at  Pittsburgh Pa July 1 to 3 1902 258 SCIENCESCIENCE the summit of the Carboniferous column and probably of Permian age The city itself is located mostly on the Conamaugh formation or the old Barren Series of Rod gers the central red beds of which crop along all the railroads which enter the city and give no end of trouble from landslides slips and caves These red beds enclose one of the most interesting deposits of the entire Carboniferous column viz the Ames or Crinoidal limestone It marks the end of marine life in the Carboniferous waters of the Appalachian field and is a most important key rock Coming as it does 300 feet below the Pittsburgh coal bed and at an equal interval above the Upper Freeport seam it has been traced from central West Virginia around through western Pennsylvania across Ohio and back into southern West Virginia near Huntington Within easy access from Pittsburgh the geologist may see all of the Carboniferous and on the crest of the great Chestnut Ridge arch above Connellsville get a peep deep down into the Devonian This however has been given in the dia gram before you which represents the rocks under Pittsburgh as revealed in the deepest oil boring ever made in America and with one exception the deepest in the world This record we owe to the intelli gent interest in pure science of Mr W J Young of Pittsburgh now at the head of the great producing interests of the Standard Oil Co At an expense of many thousands of dollars Mr Young drilled this well near West Elizabeth Pa to a depth of 5575 feet and gave to Professor Hallock of Columbia University the op portunity to make his important contribu tions to earth temperatures This is but one of numerous examples of encouragement to pure science given by the officers and agents of that muchabused organization 259 But interesting as are the stratified rocks of the remote past in the Pittsburgh region the surface deposits tell for many a still more attractive story The clays silts sands gravels and cobbles which rest upon the ancient river bottoms and mantle up the slopes to 300 feet above the present streams unfold a most interesting history They reveal a river during Tertiary time flowing with its bed immediately under the site of the Carnegie Institute 200 feet above the present streams descending with gentle fall only one third the rate of the present rivers and at Beaver instead of turning southward down the Ohio keeping northward and joining the St Lawrence system in the region of Lake Erie Then in Quaternary time this north wardflowing river was met by a great mass of southwardmoving ice and other glacial ddbris which effectually impounded the Allegheny and Monongahela drainage and caused their waters to intermingle across the East Liberty valley and finally to cut a new pathway to the sea along what is now the Ohio River This great inland lake is marked by a series of deposits of clay sand boulders and other transported materials upon all except steep surfaces up to a little more than 1000 feet above tide over the entire basin of the two rivers Mr Campbell of the U S Geological Sur vey has recognized the character of these upland deposits as having been made in a lakelike body of water but has erro neously referred them to a local ice dam The one great dam which we know existed just north from Beaver

geography during the period A New Meteorite from Algoma Kewaunee County Wisconsin WILLIAM HERBERT HOBBS The Algoma meteorite which was plow ed up near Algoma Wis in 1887 was rec ognized in March of the present year as a true meteorite It is almost unique among meteorites because of its peculiar shape and surface markings Whereas most meteor ites are quite irregular in form this me teorite is in the shape of a thin shield or disk with convex and concave sides Con trary to common notions it is quite clear that this body when it entered the atmos phere of the earth presented its convex surface to the front and was in part by the erosion of the air given its present form and its convex surface was deeply eroded From a central smooth elliptical area upon the front radial and slightly spiral groov ings proceed to the circumference of the meteorite It seems clear that these groov ings and ridges are the result of fusion and erosion by the compressed air the deadair area in front of the center pre venting a similar grooving there Although not generally appreciated it appears that there have been other disk like meteorites and from the principles of mechanics it is clear that they like the Algoma meteorite must have moved through the atmosphere with their broad side on The Algoma meteorite shows well the Widmanfstatten figures produced by etch ing and also numerous crystals of schreib ersite The Meteorites of Northwestern Kansas OLIVER C FARRINGTON Of the thirteen meteorites known from Kansas six have been found within an area 115 miles long by 85 miles broad in the northwestern part of the State As these all resemble each other in outward appearance the question has been raised as to whether they belong to a single fall In deciding the question the probable course of a meteor and the structure and compo sition of the meteorites should be dis cussed It is shown that the probable course of the meteor would have been from southeast to northwest and not from south west to northeast as would be required if the meteorites belonged to a single fall As regards structure and composition three of the meteorites have been studied while the other three have not Results of studies of two of the latter Long Island and Frank linville are given and the Long Island me teorite shown to be in several respects re markable The conclusion is reached that two of the meteorites may belong to one fall but that the others are single individ ual falls The Mohokea Caldera on Hawaii C H IHITCHCOCK The eruptions from Mauna Loa upon the southwest side are different from those upon the northeast chiefly in being of the explosive type The new map of Hawaii develops the interesting facts of the exist ence of an immense depression analogous to a caldera a few miles back from Punu luu It is of larger dimensions than the celebrated calderas of Mauna Loa and Kilauea Ellipsoidal Structure in the preCambrian Basic and Intermediate Rocks of the Lake Superior Region J MORGAN CLEMENTS The greenstones of preCambrian age in the Lake Superior region have very com SCIENCE 260AUauST 15 1902 monly developed in them a structure which since the masses separated by this struc ture are ellipsoidal is designated ellip soidal structure This structure was de scribed and illustrated by means of lantern slides A review of the ideas held by various observers concerning the origin of this structure was given and the conclusion was reached that the ellipsoidal was an orig inal structure due to the breaking up of a viscous lava while it was being extruded The structure is of widespread occurrence especially in the greenstones of the Lake Superior region The desirability of using the term ellip soidal  instead of spheroidal in referring to this structure is urged in view of the fact that it is an original structure and that the bodies formed by this structure are ellipsoidal whereas the spheroidal struc ture in the rocks is of secondary nature and is due to exfoliation caused by weather ing Vermilion District of Minnesota J MOR GAN CLEMENTS The Vermilion district occurs in north eastern Minnesota extending from Vermil ion lake N 70 E to Gunflint lake on

north by the Archean granite and on the south by the Huronian granite Keweenawan gabbro with the Upper Huronian slates coming in for a short distance The ores are high grade hematites averaging 63 per cent of iron and 05 per cent of phosphorus and they are found in structural basins Since this district began to ship ore in 1884 it has sent out some 17000000 tons of ore and the greater part of this came to Pitts burgh As regards the origin of the iron it ap pears to come first from preexisting rocks and then it is deposited to form the sedi mentary ironbearing formations In the case of the Archean Soudan the most eco nomically important ironbearing forma tion of this region the iron comes from the Archean greenstone basic and intermedi ate intrusives and volcanics Later after the folding the iron is leached from the ironbearing formation chiefly and after being carried down by descending meteoric waters is precipitated as the oxide in places favorable for its accumulation thus

physiography of the coastwise SCIENCE 261N S VOL XVI No 398 mountains of British Columbia and Alas ka The term Pacific Mountains which was used by Powell as a designation for the westernmost ranges of the United States was extended to apply to the moun tain ranges contiguous to the Pacific Ocean from Lower California to the Alaskan peninsula North of the United States the moun tains are generally flattopped and their uniform summits are considered to repre sent uplifted peneplains Back of them the plateaus of the interior are of similar origin Reasoning from the antecedent character of the rivers which head in the inland plateau and cross the coastal mountain belts and also from local mer ging of interior and mountain plateaus it was shown that the peneplains of the vari ous regions can be correlated A great sea wardsloping surface of erosion was pro duced in Eocene time and upon it the pre cursors of the present drainage systems were developed Since the completion of this peneplain all of the existing moun tains have been formed mainly by differ ential uplift attendant upon the general elevation of northwestern North America Development of the Southeastern Missouri Lowlands C F MARBUT Abstract read by W M Davis The lowland region of southeastern Mis souri consists of two broad belts of flat lowland with a discontinuous ridge between them One of the lowland belts is an aban doned valley of the Mississippi river the other is the valley of the Ohio The Mis sissippi river has gained its existing valley by two successive changes abandoning first about 200 miles of its original valley and later about twenty more It was led to abandon its valley because of a shorter and steeper course having been offered it by the Ohio The Ohio drainage first cap tured some of the small tributaries of the Mississippi and later the Mississippi turned itself into these valleys in succession by sapping the ridge between Since the cap ture of the Mississippi several of the small er rivers of the region have abandoned their older valleys NOTEThe above papers were presented through the Geological Society of America and for more complete accounts of the same see Bul letin G S A Vol

title Possible Effects of the Glacial Period upon the Land Levels of Central Asia G FREDERICK WRIGHT That northern and central Asia has ex perienced an extensive subsidence in recent geological time is proved by a variety of evidence 1 Stadling reports gravel terraces con taining fresh pieces of wood several miles back from the lower part of the Lena river 650 feet above it In some cases these ter races contain the bones of the mastodon and are resting upon solid ice 2 On the south shore of the Black sea at Trebizond and Samsun and upon the north shore around the Crimea there are fresh gravels which are evidently beach de posits hanging upon the sides of cliffs indicating a recent subsidence of that whole region to the extent certainly of 750 feet 3 In the Dariel pass on the north side of the Caucasus mountains a few miles above Vladikavkas there are extensive re cent water deposits with the finer material at the bottom and the coarser material at the top which could have accumulated only when the gradient of the incline was very SCIENCE 262AUGUST 15 1902 much less than it is now These accumula tions are sometimes more than 200 feet thick and are beyond the reach of any glaciers which ever extended down the north side of the range While these do not indicate a depression below the surface of the ocean they do necessitate a depres sion to the south such as would change the relative level of the valley occupied by the upper part of the Terek river 4 The existence of arctic seal Phoca annelate in Lake Baikal is best explained on the theory of a recent depression per mitting the sea to extend inwards to all the points now marked by that level The lake is 1561 feet above the sea and fully 2000 miles distant as the river runs The presence of the seal in the lake is readily explained by this supposition of a recent subsidence of the region but is not satis factorily explained by any other theory Reaching the enclosure while it was an arm of the sea the seal would find a favorable habitat and when on reelevation of the land the basin became cut off from direct communication with the sea the water would still be salt and would grow fresh so gradually that the species could adjust itself to the slowly changing conditions and remain a permanent inhabitant The same seal is also found in the Caspian sea and was formerly found in the Aral sea 5 The distribution of the loess around the base of the Alatau and other immense mountain masses of central Asia is such as to indicate a temporary water level from 2500 to 3000 feet higher than now What ever may have been the ultimate origin of this peculiar soil its distribution in north ern China in Turkestan about the base of Mount Ararat at the southern base of the Caucasus mountains and over the plains of southern Russia is unaccountable except by the assistance of water action while the occurrence of the bones of postPliocene animals and the remains of man under neath it both in Russia and in Siberia to gether with the small amount of erosion that has taken place in it indicates that the change of level was approximately con temporaneous with the glacial period both in America and in northwestern Europe The result of observations in eastern Mongolia Manchuria Transbaikalia and along the base of the Tian Shan range in Turkestan was to show that during the glacial period there was no extension of ice anywhere in Asia south of the sixtieth degree of latitude at all corresponding to that in America and in Europe therefore the weight of ice could not explain the de pression of the Asiatic continent But the removal of 6000000 cubic miles of water from the ocean bed to form the glaciers of Europe and America which would be equal to 24000000000000000 tons would naturally so disturb the bal ance of forces that a continental mass like Asia with mountains rising from 25000 to 30000 feet above the sea would sink down by its own weight Recent Geology of the Jordaqn Valley G FREDERICK WRIGHT West of the Jordan the descent from Jerusalem to Jericho is something more than 3000 feet in about fifteen miles and the underlying rock is all Cretaceous the strata dipping to the east even more rapidly than the road descends A fault of some 4000 to 5000 feet occurs along the Jordan valley so that the abrupt wall which forms the western face of the mountains of Moab has at its base Nubian sandstone strata which underlie the Cretaceous the Creta ceous rocks appearing near the summit where the elevation is about 4000 feet above the Dead sea or nearly the same as that of Jerusalem and the surrounding hills of Judea SCIENCE 263N S VOL XVI No 398 Approximately the grand movements producing this fault may be fixed as be ginning in the Middle Tertiary period since Lower Tertiary rocks consisting of nummulitic limestone are found on Mounts Carmel Ebal and Gerizim and on some of the heights in the vicinity of Jerusalem and to the south of Hebron The extensive postTertiary deposits of silt extend as high as 750 feet above the Dead sea showing that up to arecent time the water was 750 feet higher than now producing a lake several times larger than the Dead sea and extending southward about forty miles beyond the Dead sea in which were deposited hundreds of feet of fine sediment where side streams came in and one hundred feet or more over the en tire valley In the wady Zuweiya where it enters the depression near the south end of the Dead sea one can see the fine laminae of this sediment as it has gradually accumulated to a depth of between 200 and 300 feet just below the 750foot line and where it has been exposed by subsequent erosion The Jordan valley throughout all its lower portion occupies a narrow gorge which it has cut out of this sedimentary deposit The river is constantly under mining its banks now on one side and now on another leaving pretty generally per pendicular walls of the sedimentary depos its separated from the river by a flood plain of varying width averaging about a quarter of a mile As a consequence the river is extremely muddy as it enters the Dead sea Notwithstanding the vigor of these ero sive agencies only a relatively small por tion of the sediment has been washed away and the Dead sea is still unfilled which is a witness to the recentness of its forma tion The drainage basin of the Jordan valley is more than 10000 square miles in extent while the immediate valley itself is scarcely one fifteenth as large All the wash of this large drainage area finally lodges in the valley If we estimate the rate of erosion in the drainage basin of the Jordan at one foot in 2000 years the age of the Jordan fault must be reckoned in tens of thousands of years rather than in hundreds of thou sands thus confirming the shorter geolog ical chronology of the physicists History of the Discoveries and Discussions Concerning the Glacial Terraces in the Upper Ohio and its Tributaries G FREDERICK WRIGHT Szbmerged Valleys in Sandusky Bay E L MOSELEY Tilting of the earths crust is causing a depression of the land at the southwest ex tremity of Lake Erie as compared with the outlet at Buffalo The effect of this is shown in the vicinity of Sandusky by the extension of the water over the low ground as evidenced by surveys submerged stumps slack water in the lower course of all the streams and submerged stalagmites in the caves of Putin bay It is also shown by the fact that from the mouth of each stream entering Sandusky bay a val ley now filled with mud can be traced out through the bay These valleys show a rise of the water of at least forty feet Some Geological Notes in Honduras Cen tral America J FRANCIS PATCHLE BARON Read by title The main geological features of Hondu ras are volcanic

metamorphosed The Great Canyon of the Euphrates River ELLSWORTH HUNTINGTON Although the Euphrates river is known by name to every one certain parts of its upper course are still almost unexplored One of the least known sections is where the river after the junction of its two larg est branches flows over great rapids through the Taurus mountains in an im mense canyon In 1883 the great German general von Moltke floated down this part of the stream on a raft of inflated sheepskins manned by Kurds but the rapids are so formidable that for over sixty years no other Euro peans visited the region In the spring of 1901 Professor T H Norton U S Consul at Harput Turkey and the writer made the same journey using a raft of inflated sheepskins manned by Armenian fishermen For the first hundred miles no great diffi culties were met although at one place the Kurds threatened the party with their guns because the strangers floated past the place where a Kurdish lord had the right of ferriage In another place a crowd of Turkish villagers stoned the raft because the Armenian fishermen had no fish to sell In both cases the natives refrained from further violence out of respect for the fact that the travelers wore hats and so must be men of consequence Two small canyons were traversed the second of which nearly 2000 feet deep was the picturesque home of large herds of ibex Below this is a holy mountain with several shrines at one of which rises an immense square altar of rough stone all covered with the gore of the numerous goats and sheep which are here offered in sacrifice by both Christian Armenians and Mohammedan Turks The main canyon is cleft through the mountains to a depth of from 2000 to 5000 feet and the contracted stream thunders over rapid after rapid between towering walls of frowning basalt or cas tellated buff limestone In many ways it resembles the grand canyon of the Colo rado with its exceedingly swift current ob structed here and there by fans of detritus brought in from the sides its steep walls of naked rocks and its raging rapids In some places the main stream has cut its gorge so fast that the smaller tributaries could not keep pace with it and so fall over the walls into the river in a series of cascades All these facts and many others show that the Euphrates is very young geologically The real difficulties of the voyage began in the great canyon At the first big rapid a whole day was spent in making a portage of two miles involving a climb of 1200 feet over an almost impassable road in an other place while the raft was being let down past a rapid with ropes a raft of logs floated by on which were two almost nude Kurds with tridents for paddles and SCIENCE 265N S VOL XVI No 398 strings of dried gourds around their waists for preservers The difficulties became greater and great er as the party floated swiftly into the wild er parts of the canyon where rapids were shot far larger than those where portages had been made a day or two earlier The raftsmens nerves were so completely un strung one night that they dared neither shoot the rapids nor climb the mountain side to get help from the Kurds in making a portage Next day the wildest of all the rapids was reached The raftsmen dared not shoot it and a portage was out of the question so the Americans decided to shoot it alone in spite of the entreaties of the servants who fell on their knees and with tears in their eyes begged the for eigners not to go to certain death The raft shot into the rapids over a long smooth tilting sheet of water there was a wild exhilarating slide and the great waves broke over the explorers time and time again wetting them through to the skin the raft whirled round and round Soon the danger was passed and the raft safely moored The journey lasted seven days because of the numerous portages although the actual time occupied in float ing on the river was but thirtyseven hours The youthfulness of the deeper part of the canyon seems to be due to a recent re vival of deformation which has caused the streams to incise deep steepsided V shaped young valleys in the bottoms of broad Ushaped older valleys Systematic Geography W M DAVIS Observations of geographical matters by travelers and explorers are usually incom plete in one respect or another largely be cause there is no maturely developed and generally

a silver mine Its surrounding is now a cornfield with a black vegetable soil of some two yards in thickness In this soil we found the great meteorite deeply imbedded Its surface was but a little below the surface of the ground The general form of the mass seen from the side was that of one ramus of a huge jaw The surface was entirely covered with pittings very regular in size and about two to three inches across shallow but with welldefined walls There were no areas which showed the devastation of deep rust a fact due both to the dryness of the soil and to the large alloy of nickel in the iron On one side there was a deep crack running horizontally through half the length of the mass At one end this crack was too narrow to insert a knife blade at the other end it was nearly three inches wide Over the area the vegetable soil was from three to four feet deep while below it was a porphyry rock common in this part of the country much broken up by natural cleavages and decomposed in situ Immediately around the meteorite we had dug much lower leaving the great iron mass poised on a pillar or pedestal of the undisturbed rock It needed little me chanical aid to make the mass turn over

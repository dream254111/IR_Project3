passes under the control of strong groups of individuals creates one of the most serious problems of modern times The larger the organization and the more diversified its character the more easily does it seem to lend itself to manipulation The political economist appreciates the gravity of a situation where capitalistic groups gain constantly larger powers over widely divergent enterprises The problem is complex it is difficult to define cause or to suggest remedy The evil of cen tralization has so insidiously permeated our financial industrial and commercial life that every serious attempt at decentraliza tion menaces the prosperity of the country The statement has been made with some semblance of accuracy that a single group of bankers have power to make or destroy any enterprise of great magnitude in the United States It has also been said that no large organization however meritorious has any chance to secure the capital it requires if the business of that organiza tion seriously threatens any property which these great interests either own or have under their immediate protection It is no longer necessary to buy up legislatures as capital can do better by managing political parties through banking interests It is no longer necessary to eliminate competition by absorbing or destroying as was done in the early days of the Standard Oil Company for the maintenance of prices with a reduction of output is more economical and less brutal Corporations are created upon the presumption that control should rest in a majority of the stock It usually takes much less than a majority interest to dominate corporations if the stock is widely distributed The ownership of twenty per cent of the stock of some of the great corporations of this country may carry control of the whole corporation The facility with 48EVILS OF CORPORATION CONTROL which corporate organizations can be managed has encouraged their use for personal and selfish purposes In certain types of corporations men use their power as if they were handling their own personal property and in certain sections of the country business practise gives tacit consent if not approval to these methods  To the victor belong the spoils is a rule not uni versally but frequently applied to the management of corpora tions in America As distinguished from such usual methods we find on the contrary many corporations conducted by men of strictest probity and in accordance with the highest stand ards of business ethicsa fact indicating that abuses of power are not universal or necessarily permanent This brings us to a consideration of the final phase of our subject Granting the need of investment opportunity for the masses the existence of ample fields for the safe and profitable employment of money and the practicability of the above plan for distribution of securities what will be the outcome of such a scheme on the evils of control Will it facilitate control by powerful individuals or will it make it more difficult Will it tend to accentuate or lessen the abuses of such control In considering the subject we should keep clear the distinction between control and the abuses of control By our plan con trol may conceivably be made more difficult while the abuses of control are made easier and safer on the other hand the facility of control may not be affected while the evils arising from such control are eradicated The best answer to these questions can be derived from a study of the history of corporations analogous in character to the one here contemplated If it can be shown that corpora tions in which men of small means have a substantial interest exhibit none or few of the abuses generally prevailing it is a fair presumption that the same conditions will ultimately prevail in any other class of business in which the small investor is educated to place his savings Let us take our first illustration from the savings banks They are the only large financial organizations in this country in which the small investor has an interest in his investment at the same time direct simple and intelligible to him During 49CAFITAL AND LABOR UNIFIED the past thirty or forty years a code of legal regulations has come into existence guarding the interests of the management and of the investor to a degree of perfection almost without parallel in modern law This development has come about gradually almost unconsciously as a recognition of the respon sibility which is taken by those selected for the guardianship of the savings of the poor The standards are partly selfassumed by the men selected for the management of savings banks but they have also grown out of the fact that every depositor is vitally interested in the protection of his property It is but fair to assume that gradually the same measure of protection will come into existence in connection with corporations engag ing in other lines of business when the ownership of such cor porations is sufficiently distributed among the same class of in vestors Life insurance is another illustration somewhat more complex in character and less simple as an example The policy holder is an instalment purchaser but ordinarily speaking he is much more concerned in life insurance than in investment The in vestment feature of a lifeinsurance policy is incidental At the time of the great insurance investigations the first thing the lifeinsurance companies did was to bring forth indisputable evidence as to their solvency This was the immediate concern of the policy holder and once satisfied on that point he lost in terest owing to the complex character of the investment feature in this policy No matter how brazenly the heads of the great lifeinsurance companies have used their power for personal ends it has rarely been to the extent of jeopardizing the solvency of the business Under present conditions the management of such companies leaves little to be desired and it is fair to be lieve that the most prosperous companies in the country will be those making the best record for clean business and satisfactory earnings The most conspicuous example of the working out of a national policy controlling the minute distribution of property is to be found in France where all grades of society are in the habit of investing in approved securities of every kind where the acquisition of property in fact has become almost a national VOL II 50EVILS OF CORPORATION CONTROL passion Surrounding investments under French methods we find an almost ideal fabric of protective measures both social and legal To become bankrupt in France is equivalent to social suicide The Frenchman is jealous of his reputation for conservatism because such a reputation is essential to any kind of business success If the personal control of great corpora tions in France is possible such control is subject to safeguards beyond our conception The minority interests in French cor porations have rights which are entirely unknown in this country It is not important whether these laws have grown up as a re sult of the habit of investing in securities by people of small means or whether the acquisition of such securities has been the sequence of good law The two are now coexistent a part of a whole making for the prosperity of the French nation The vital fact is that if men of small means are in the habit of utilizing their savings for any type of purchase laws come into existence which give them ample protection Give the small saver a simple and definite right in any kind of property and he will see that his right is safeguarded A capitalist of fair social standing may manipulate stock of a Wallstreet corpora tion with impunity when he would hesitate a long time before facing the indignation of a mob of savingsbank depositors The effort of the United States Steel Corporation to distribute stock among employes is commendable though badly handled but the lesson to be learned is neither the spirit nor the method but the result upon the management of a diversified ownership of a corporation by its own employes Every protection is thrown about these investors to safeguard them against loss or discontentment It is an illustration of the attitude of the man of right instincts and liberal training when dealing with the funds of the masses In America the distribution of investment securities among people of small means has been in the hands of those who fear neither social ostracism nor the arm of the law But let men of reputation make plans for the distribution of securities among the common people and we shall find automatically growing an increasing sense of responsibility and mutual respect between the investor and the management with all necessary legislation to protect both It would therefore No I 552 CAPITAL AND LABOR UAIFIED seem reasonable to suppose that whether or not control of cor porations would be made more difficult by our plan the flagrant abuses of control which now prevail because they are to a cer tain extent looked upon as a part of the gambling game would be quickly reduced and in the end substantially eliminated

BAKERIAN LECTUREON A METHOD OF METEOROLOGICAL REGISTRATION OF THE CHEMICAL ACTION OF TOTAL DAYLIGHT BY HENRY ENFIELD ROSCOE BA FRS PROFESSOR OF CHEMISTRY IN OWENS COLLEGE MANCHESTER RECEIVED NOVEMBER 8READ DECEMBER 22 1864 IN THE LAST MEMOIR ON PHOTOCHEMICAL MEASUREMENTS PRESENTED TO THE ROYAL SOCIETYFT PROFESSOR BUNSEN AND I DESCRIBED A METHOD FOR DETERMINING BY SIMPLE OBSERVATIONS THE VARYING AMOUNT OF CHEMICAL ACTION EFFECTED BY THE DIRECT AND DIFFUSE SUNLIGHT ON PHOTO GRAPHIC PAPER FOUNDED UPON A LAW DISCOVERED BY US VIZ THAT EQUAL PRODUCTS OF THE INTENSITY OF THE LIGHT INTO THE TIMES OF INSOLATION CORRESPOND WITHIN VERY WIDE LIMITS TO EQUAL SHADES OF TINTS PRODUCED ON CHLORIDEOFSILVER PAPER OF UNIFORM SENSITIVENESSSO THAT LIGHT OF THE INTENSITY 50 ACTING FOR THE TIME 1 PRODUCES THE SAME BLACKENING EFFECT AS LIGHT OF THE INTENSITY 1 ACTING FOR THE TIME 50 FOR THE PURPOSE OF EXPOSING THIS PAPER TO LIGHT FOR A KNOWN BUT VERY SHORT LENGTH OF TIME A PENDULUM PHOTOMETER WAS CON STRUCTED AND BY MEANS OF THIS INSTRUMENT A STRIP OF PAPER IS SO EXPOSED THAT THE DIFFERENT TIMES OF INSOLATION FOR ALL POINTS ALONG THE LENGTH OF THE STRIP CAN BE CALCULATED TO WITHIN SMALL FRACTIONS OF A SECOND WHEN THE DURATION AND AMPLITUDE OF VIBRATION OF THE PEN DULUM ARE KNOWN THE STRIP OF SENSITIVE PAPER INSOLATED DURING THE OSCILLATION OF THE PENDULUM EXHIBITS THROUGHOUT ITS LENGTH A REGULARLY DIMINISHING SHADE FROM DARK TO WHITE AND BY REFERENCE TO A TABLE THE TIME NEEDED TO PRODUCE ANY ONE OF THESE SHADES CAN BE ASCERTAINED THE UNIT OF PHOTOCHEMICAL INTENSITY IS ASSUMED TO BE THAT OF THE LIGHT WHICH PRODUCES UPON THE STANDARD PAPER IN THE UNIT OF TIME ONE SECOND A GIVEN BUT ARBITRARY DEGREE OF SHADE TERMED THE NORMAL TINT THE RECIPROCALS OF THE TIMES DURING WHICH THE POINTS ON THE STRIP HAVE TO BE EXPOSED IN ORDER TO ATTAIN THE NORMAL TINT GIVE THE INTENSITIES OF THE ACTING LIGHT EXPRESSED IN TERMS OF THE ABOVE UNIT ACCORDING TO THIS METHOD THE CHEMICAL ACTION OF THE TOTAL DAYLIGHT I E THE DIRECT SUNLIGHT AND THE REFLECTED LIGHT FROM THE WHOLE HEAVENS HAS BEEN DETERMINED BY MEANS OF OBSERVATIONS MADE AT FREQUENT INTERVALS THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND CURVES REPRESENTING THE VARIATION OF DAILY CHEMICAL INTENSITY AT MANCHESTER HAVE BEEN DRAWN THE LABOUR OF OBTAINING A REGULAR SERIES OF SUCH DAILY MEASUREMENTS OF THE CHEMICAL ACTION OF DAY LIGHT ACCORDING TO THIS METHOD IS HOWEVER VERY CONSIDERABLE THE APPARATUS REQUIRED  IT IS TO BE CAREFULLY BORNE IN MIND THAT NO ABSOLUTE MEASUREMENT OF THE MORE REFRANGIBLE SOLAR RAYS FALLING ON THE EARTHS SURFACE IS POSSIBLE EXCEPT BY THE EXPRESSION OF THEIR HEATPRODUCING EFFECT AND THAT ALL METHODS OF MEASURING THE INTENSITY OF THESE RAYS DEPENDING UPON THE ACTION WHICH THEY PRODUCE ON ANY SINGLE CHEMICAL COMPOUND GIVE RESULTS WHICH ARE ONLY TRUE FOR THE PARTICULAR RAYS AFFECTING THE COMPOUND SELECTED AS THE STANDARD OF COMPARISON T PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 1863 P 139  IBID 1863 P 160 MDCCCLXV 4 OPROFESSOR ROSCOE ON A METHOD OF METEOROLOGICAL IS BULKY THE OBSERVATIONS CAN ONLY BE MADE IN CALM WEATHER AND THE QUANTITY OF SENSI TIVE PAPER NEEDED FOR A DAYS OBSERVATIONS IS LARGE THE AIM OF THE FOLLOWING COMMUNICATION IS TO DESCRIBE A VERY SIMPLE MODE OF DETER MINING AT ANY MOMENT THE CHEMICAL ACTION OF THE WHOLE DIRECT AND DIFFUSE SUNLIGHT AS MEASURED BY CHLORIDEOFSILVER PAPER ADAPTED TO THE PURPOSE OF REGULAR METEOROLOGICAL REGISTRATION AND FOUNDED UPON THE PRINCIPLES LAID DOWN IN THE MEMOIR ABOVE ALLUDED TO ACCORDING TO THIS METHOD A REGULAR SERIES OF DAILY OBSERVATIONS CAN WITHOUT DIFFICULTY BE KEPT UP AT FREQUENT INTERVALS THE WHOLE APPARATUS NEEDED FOR EXPOSURE CAN BE PACKED INTO VERY SMALL SPACE THE OBSERVATIONS CAN BE CARRIED ON WITHOUT REGARD TO WIND OR WEATHER AND NO LESS THAN FORTYFIVE SEPARATE DETERMINATIONS CAN BE MADE UPON 36 SQUARE CENTIMETRES OF SENSITIVE PAPER STRIPS OF THE STANDARD CHLORIDEOFSILVER PAPER TINTED IN THE PENDULUM PHOTOMETER REMAIN AS THE BASIS OF THE MORE SIMPLE MODE OF MEASUREMENT NOW TO BE DESCRIBED TWO STRIPS OF THIS PAPER ARE EXPOSED AS USUAL IN THE PENDULUM PHOTOMETER ONE OF THESE STRIPS IS FIXED IN HYPOSULPHITEOFSODIUM SOLUTION WASHED DRIED AND PASTED UPON A BOARD FURNISHED WITH A MILLIMETRESCALE THIS FIXED STRIP IS NOW GRADUATED IN TERMS OF THE UNFIXED PENDULUM STRIP BY READING OFF WITH THE LIGHT OF A SODAFLAME THE POSITION OF THOSE POINTS ON EACH STRIP WHICH POSSESS EQUAL DEGREES OF TINT THE POSITION OF THE NORMAL TINT UPON THE UNFIXED STRIP BEING ASCERTAINED FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE GRADUATION THE FIXED STRIP THUS BECOMES IN EVERY RESPECT EQUIVALENT TO THE UNFIXED STRIP UPON THIS COMPARISON WITH THE UNFIXED PENDULUM STRIP DEPENDS THE SUBSEQUENT USE OF THE FIXED STRIP IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE CHEMICAL ACTION OF DAYLIGHT CAN BE MEASURED BY HELP OF THIS FIXED AND GRADUATED STRIP LET US SUPPOSE IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT WE HAVE ASCERTAINED THE POSITION OF THOSE POINTS UPON THE FIXED STRIP WHICH POSSESS AN EQUAL DEGREE OF TINT TO POINTS ON THE UNFIXED STRIP SITUATED AT REGULAR INTERVALS SAY 10 MILLIMS FROM EACH OTHER BY REFERENCE TO TABLE I OF THE ABOVEMENTIONED MEMOIR GIVEN BELOW WE THEN FIND THE RELATION BETWEEN THE TIMES OF EXPOSURE NECESSARY TO EFFECT THE TINTS IN QUESTION WHEN THE INTENSITY OF THE LIGHT REMAINS CONSTANT LET US SUPPOSE IN THE SECOND PLACE THAT THE POSITION ON THE UNFIXED STRIP OF WHICH THE SHADE CORRESPONDS TO THAT OF THE NORMAL TINT HAS BEEN FOUND AND THAT THE TIME OF EXPOSURE PLACED OPPOSITE TO THIS POSITION IN TABLE I HAS BEEN NOTICED IF NOW THE VARIOUS TINTS ON THE STRIP HAD BEEN PRODUCED IN ONE AND THE SAME TIME BY LIGHTS OF DIFFERENT INTENSITIES INSTEAD OF BEING EFFECTED BY LIGHT OF THE SAME INTENSITY ACTING FOR DIFFERENT TIMES THE LAW ABOVE ALLUDED TO SHOWS THAT THE NUMBERS FOUND IN THE TABLE WOULD REPRESENT THE RELATION OF THESE DIFFERENT INTENSITIES SO THAT IN ORDER TO EXPRESS THIS RELATION IN TERMS OF THE UNIT OF INTENSITY EMPLOYED IT IS ONLY NECESSARY TO MULTIPLY THE NUMBERS THUS OBTAINED BY A CONSTANT VIZ THE RECIPROCAL OF THE NUMBER FOUND IN COLUMN II OF THE TABLE OPPOSITE TO THE POSITION IN COLUMN I GIVING THE POINT ON THE UNFIXED STRIP EQUAL IN SHADE TO THE NORMAL TINT AN EXAMPLE MAY SERVE TO MAKE THIS CALCULATION PLAIN 1 THE POSITION ON THE UNFIXED STRIP EQUAL IN SHADE TO THE NORMAL TINT WAS FOUND TO BE 112 MILLIMS 2 THE POSITIONS ON THE

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE APPARATUS EMPLOYED AND OF THE METHODS OF PREPARING AND GRADUATING THE STRIPS WILL BE GIVEN UNDER SEPARATE HEADINGS 4O2PROFESSOR ROSCOE ON A METHOD OF METEOROLOGICAL THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS MUST BE FULFILLED IN ORDER THAT THIS METHOD CAN BE ADOPTED AS A RELIABLE MEASUREMENT OF THE CHEMICAL ACTION OF LIGHT 1ST THE TINT OF THE STANDARD STRIPS FIXED IN HYPOSULPHITE MUST REMAIN PERFECTLY UNALTERABLE DURING A CONSIDERABLE LENGTH OF TIME 2ND THE TINTS UPON THESE FIXED STRIPS MUST SHADE REGULARLY INTO EACH OTHER SO AS TO RENDER POSSIBLE AN ACCURATE COMPARISON WITH AND GRADUATION IN TERMS OF THE UNFIXED PENDULUM STRIPS 3RD SIMULTANEOUS MEASUREMENTS MADE WITH DIFFERENT STRIPS THUS GRADUATED MUST SHOW CLOSE AGREEMENT AMONGST THEMSELVES AND THEY MUST GIVE THE SAME RESULTS AS DETERMINATIONS MADE BY MEANS OF THE PENDULUM PHOTOMETER ACCORDING TO THE METHOD DESCRIBED ON PAGES 158 159 OF THE LAST MEMOIR I PREPARATION OF THE STANDARD FIXED STRIPS FOR THE PURPOSE OF PREPARING THE FIXED STRIPS SHEETS OF GOOD WHITE PHOTOGRAPHIC PAPER ARE SALTED IN A SOLUTION CONTAINING 3 PER CENT OF CHLORIDE OF SODIUM EXACTLY ACCORDING TO THE DIRECTIONS GIVEN IN THE LAST MEMOIR P 155 FOR THE PREPARATION OF THE STANDARD PAPER THE SALTED PAPER AFTER DRYING IS CUT INTO PIECES 16 CENTIMETRES IN LENGTH BY 15 CENTIMETRES IN BREADTH AND SILVERED ON A BATH CONTAINING 12 PARTS OF NITRATE OF SILVER TO 100 PARTS OF WATER AFTER DRYING ONE OF THESE PAPERS IS FIXED AT THE CORNERS UPON A BOARD COVERED BY A WELLFITTING LID OF SHEET ZINC SO MADE THAT IT DOES NOT TOUCH THE PAPER THE PAPER IS THEN BLACKENED BY EXPOSURE TO THE ACTION OF LIGHT IN THE PENDULUM APPARATUS FOR THIS PURPOSE THE THIN ELASTIC SHEET OF THE BLACKENED MICA USUALLY EMPLOYED IS REPLACED BY A PIECE OF THIN SHEET ZINC 16 CENTIMETRES BROAD THE FRAME CARRYING THE PAPER IS CLAMPED ON TO THE HORIZONTAL PLATE OF PENDULUM PHOTO METER AND THE SHEET OF BLACKENED ZINC PLACED OVER IT THE COVER IS THEN WITHDRAWN AND THE PAPER EXPOSED BY ALLOWING THE PENDULUM WITH THE SHEET OF ZINC ATTACHED TO IT TO VIBRATE UNTIL THE REQUIRED TINT HAS BEEN ATTAINED THE COVER IS THEN REPLACED THE FRAME OPENED IN THE DARK ROOM THE PAPER WASHED TO REMOVE EXCESS OF NITRATE OF SILVER FIXED IN A SATURATED SOLUTION OF HYPOSULPHITE OF SODIUM AND WELL WASHED FOR THREE DAYS AS THE TINTS OF THE FOXYRED COLOUR WHICH THE PAPER POSSESSES AFTER FIXING CAN BE ACCU RATELY COMPARED WITH THE BLUISHGREY TINT OF THE FRESHLYEXPOSED PAPER BY MEANS OF THE MONOCHROMATIC LIGHT OF THE SODAFLAME THE USE OF A TONINGBATH WAS SPECIALLY AVOIDED AS LIKELY TO RENDER THE PAPER LIABLE TO FADE EACH SHEET THUS PREPARED IS CUT INTO FOUR STRIPS 160 MILLIMS LONG AND 30 MILLIMS BROAD WHICH ARE THEN PRESERVED FOR GRADUATION IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER THESE FIXED STRIPS UNDERGO ANY ALTERATION IN TINT BY EXPOSURE TO LIGHT OR WHEN PRESERVED IN THE DARK TWO CONSECUTIVE STRIPS WERE CUT OFF FROM SEVERAL DIFFERENT SHEETS AND THE POINT ON EACH AT WHICH THE SHADE WAS EQUAL TO THAT OF THE STANDARD TINT SEE LAST MEMOIR P 157 WAS DETERMINED BY READING OFF WITH THE LIGHT OF THE SODAFLAME BY MEANS OF THE ARRANGEMENTS FULLY DESCRIBED ON P 143 OF THE ABOVECITED MEMOIR ONEHALF OF THESE STRIPS WERE CAREFULLY PRESERVED IN THE DARK THE OTHER HALF EXPOSED TO DIRECT AND DIFFUSE SUNLIGHT FOR PERIODS VARYING FROM FOURTEEN DAYS TO SIX MONTHS AND THE POSITION OF EQUALITY OF TINT WITH THE STANDARD TINT FROM TIME TO 608REGISTRATION OF THE CHEMICAL ACTION OF TOTAL DAYLIGHT TIME DETERMINED IT APPEARS FROM A LARGE NUMBER OF SUCH COMPARISONS A FEW OF WHICH ONLY ARE GIVEN BELOW THAT IN ALMOST ALL CASES AN IRREGULAR AND IN SOME INSTANCES A RAPID FADING TAKES PLACE IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE STRIPS HAVE BEEN PREPARED AND THAT THIS FADING CONTINUES FOR ABOUT SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS FROM THE DATE OF THE PREPARATION IT IS HOWEVER SEEN THAT AFTER THIS LENGTH OF TIME HAS ELAPSED NEITHER EXPOSURE TO SUNLIGHT NOR PRESER VATION IN THE DARK PRODUCES THE SLIGHTEST CHANGE OF TINT AND THAT FOR MANY MONTHS FROM THIS TIME FORWARD THE TINT OF THE STRIPS MAY BE CONSIDERED AS PERFECTLY UNALTERABLE 1 EXPERIMENTS SHOWING THE ALTERATION OF TINT ENSUING INMMEDIATELY AFTER PREPARATION EACH NUMBER

SOME INSTANCES ARISE FROM UNAVOIDABLE EXPERIMENTAL ERRORS OF VARIOUS KINDS II GRADUATION OF THE FIXED STRIPS IN TERMS OF THE STANDARD PENDULUM STRIPS THE VALUE OF THE PROPOSED METHOD OF MEASUREMENT ENTIRELY DEPENDS UPON THE POSSI BILITY OF ACCURATELY DETERMINING THE INTENSITIES OF THE VARIOUS SHADES OF THE FIXED STRIPS IN TERMS OF THE KNOWN INTENSITIES OF THE STANDARD STRIPS PREPARED IN THE PENDULUM PHO TOMETER TWO MODES OF EFFECTING THIS GRADUATION AND OF COMPARING THE ACCURACY OF THE GRA DUATION OF ONE STRIP WITH THAT OF ANOTHER WERE EMPLOYED THE FIRST OF THESE METHODS CONSISTS IN DETERMINING BY DIRECT COMPARISON THE POINTS ON THE FIXED STRIP HAVING EQUAL INTENSITIES TO POINTS ON THE PENDULUM STRIP FOR THIS PURPOSE THE POSITION OF THE STANDARD TINT UPON THE PENDULUM STRIP WAS FIRST OBSERVED CIRCULAR PIECES OF THIS STRIP SITUATED 20 MILLIMS APART WERE THEN STAMPED OUT WITH A PUNCH 5 MILLIMS IN DIAMETER AND HALF OF EACH CIRCLE PASTED ON TO THE WOODEN READING BLOCK FIG 4 OF

ONE OBSERVATION WAS MADE EVERY HALFHOUR FREQUENTLY HOWEVER WHEN THE OBJECT WAS EITHER TO CONTROL THE MEASURE MENTS OR TO RECORD THE GREAT CHANGES WHICH SUDDENLY OCCUR WHEN THE SUN IS OBSCURED OR APPEARS FROM BEHIND A CLOUD THE DETERMINATIONS WERE MADE AT INTERVALS OF A FEW MINUTES OR EVEN SECONDS SOMETIMES WHEN THE SKY WAS OVERCLOUDED OR WHEN NO GREAT CHANGES IN THE LIGHT OCCURRED THE

IRREGULAR CHANGES IN THE CHEMICAL ACTION ARE HOWEVER OBSERVED ON SOME DAYS AS ON MARCH 19 1864 FIG 16 ON WHICH THE SUN SHONE CONTINUOUSLY AND THESE ARE TO BE MAINLY ATTRIBUTED TO THE VARIATION IN THE AMOUNT OF CLOUD PASSING AT THE TIME OF OBSERVATION IN SEVERAL CASES WHEN NO APPARENT CHANGE IN THE AMOUNT OF LIGHT AS AFFECTING THE EYE COULD BE NOTICED A CONSIDERABLE AND SUDDEN ALTERATION IN THE CHEMICAL INTENSITY OCCURRED THIS WAS CLEARLY SEEN ON SEPTEMBER 26 620REGISTRATION OF THE CHEMICAL ACTION OF TOTAL DAYLIGHT 1864 WHEN THE WHOLE SKY WAS APPARENTLY UNCLOUDED THROUGHOUT THE DAY AT 9H 25

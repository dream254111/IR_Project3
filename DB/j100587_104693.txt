ARTHUR DOBBS ESQ TO CHARLES STANHOPE ESQ F R S CONCERNING BEES AND THEIR METHOD OF GATHERING WAX AND HONEY CASTLEDOBBS OCT 22 1750 SIR SINCE MY VIEW OF DOING GOOD BY MAKING DISCOVERIES OF THE GREAT WORLD HAS BEEN DISAPPOINTED UPON MY RETIREMENT INTO THIS LITTLE CORNER OF IT IRELAND AMONGST OTHER RURAL AMUSEMENTS I HAVE BEEN CONTEMPLATING THE INHA BITANTS OF THE LITTLE WORLD PARTICULARLY THAT MOST USEFUL AND INDUSTRIOUS SOCIETY OF BEES AND HAVE HAD TIME TO REVISE THE CURIOUS INGENIOUS AND ENTER TAINING ACCOUNT GIVEN BY M REAUMUR OF THAT IN IMITABLE INSECT WITH HIS CURIOUS REMARKS AND REA SONING ABOUT THEM SINCE HE HAS BEEN INDEFATIGABLE IN HIS EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THEM AS WELL AS OF MOST OTHER INSECTS I THINK IT THE DUTY OF EVERY PERSON WHO HAS HAD TIME TO MAKE ANY OB SERVATIONS WHICH MAY CONTRIBUTE TO COME AT THE TRUTH AND COMPLETE HIS NATURAL HISTORY OF INSECTS TO THROW IN HIS MITE TOWARDS IT READ NOV 8 1750 I HAD LEISURE AND OPPORTUNITIES MANY YEARS AGO TO MAKE SOME OBSERVATIONS ABOUT BEES AND ALL THAT I MADE CONFIRM HIS GENERAL THEORY AS WELL FROM HIS MICROSCOPICAL OBSERVATIONS AS THOSE MADE BY MEANS OF GLASS HIVES IN WHICH HE HAD MUCH GREATER AND BETTER OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE OBSERVATIONS THAN I HAVE HAD HOWEVER AS THERE ARE TWO THINGS IN WHICH MY OBSERVATIONS ARE DIFFERENT FROM HIS I THINK 1537 THINK IT BUT JUSTICE TO THE CURIOUS AND LEARNED WORLD TO MENTION THEM THAT M REAUMUR IN CASE HE BE ALIVE AND STILL ABLE TO FOLLOW HIS OBSERVATIONS OR IF HE IS NOT THAT SOME OTHER CURIOUS PERSON MAY MAKE FUTURE REMARKS TO KNOW WHETHER THOSE I HAVE MADE ARE TRUE AS I MUST OWN MYSELF DIFFIDENT OF MY OWN OBSERVATIONS WHEN THEY DIFFER FROM SO ACCURATE MINUTE AND CAREFUL AN OBSERVER AS HE HAS SHEWN HIMSELF TO BE THROUGHOUT HIS WHOLE THEORY OF INSECTS IN GENERAL AND MORE PARTICULARLY OF THE SOCIETY OF OUR GARDENBEE I THEREFORE BEG LEAVE TO LAY THE FEW REMARKS I HAVE MADE BEFORE YOU SIR THAT IF YOU THINK THERE IS ANY THING IN THEM WORTH COMMUNICATING YOU MAY LAY THEM BEFORE THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF WHICH YOU ARE A WORTHY MEMBER OR COMMUNICATE THEM TO M REAUMUR IF HE BE STILL ALIVE AND FOL LOWS HIS OBSERVATIONS THAT IN CASE MY OBSERVA VATIONS ARE FOUND TRUE HE MAY SO FAR ALTER HIS RE MARKS AND IF THEY ARE NOT CONFIRMD I SHALL WIL LINGLY SUBMIT TO HIS FUTURE OBSERVATIONS THE ONLY TWO THINGS IN WHICH I DIFFER FROM M REAUMUR ARE THAT I APPREHEND HE SAYS THE BEES RANGE FROM FLOWERS OF ONE SPECIES TO THOSE OF AN OTHER SPECIES WHILST THEY ARE GATHERING ONE LOAD SO THAT THE FARINA OR CRUDE WAX LOADED UPON THEIR LEGS IS FROM DIFFERENT SPECIES OF FLOWERS WHICH IS CONTRARY TO WHAT I HAVE OBSERVED THE OTHER THING THAT I DIFFER WITH HIM IN IS THAT HE SAYS THE WAX IS FORMED IN THE BEE FROM THE CRUDE WAX OR FARINA SO FAR I AGREE WITH HIM BUT BY HIS OB SERVATIONS HE SAYS AFTER DIGESTION IT IS DISCHARGED UPWARDS BY THE MOUTH WHEREAS BY MY OBSERVATIONS IS538 IT IS THE FOECES HUSKS OR SHELLS OF THE FARINA OR CRUDE WAX AFTER DIGESTION DISCHARGD BY THE ANUS AS TO THE FIRST I HAVE FREQUENTLY FOLLOWD A BEE LOADING THE FARINA BEEBREAD OR CRUDE WAX UPON ITS LEGS THROUGH A PART OF A GREAT FIELD IN FLOWER AND UPON WHATSOEVER FLOWER I SAW IT FIRST ALIGHT AND GATHER THE FARINA IT CONTINUED GATHERING FROM THAT KIND OF FLOWER AND HAS PASSD OVER MANY O HER SPECIES OF FLOWERS THO VERY NUMEROUS IN THE FIELD WITHOUT ALIGHTING UPON OR LOADING FROM THEM THO THE FLOWER IT CHOSE WAS MUCH SCARCER IN THE FIELD THAN THE OTHERS SO THAT IF IT BEGAN TO LOAD FROM A DAISY IT CONTINUED LOADING FROM THEM NEGLECTING CLOVER HONEYSUCKLES VIOLETS C AND IF IT BEGAN WITH ANY OF THE OTHERS IT CONTINUED LOADING FROM THE SAME KIND PASSING OVER THE DAISY SO IN A GAR DEN UPON MY WALLTREES I HAVE SEEN IT LOAD FROM A PEACH AND PASS OVER APRICOTS PLUMS CHERRIES C YET MADE NO DISTINCTION BETWIXT A PEACH AND AN ALMOND NOW M REAUMUR IN HIS MEMOIR UPON THE BEES MAKING HONEY MENTIONS ARISTOTLES OBSERVATION OF THE BEES LOADING OR GATHERING FROM ONE SPECIES OF FLOWER WITHOUT CHANGING NOT QUITTING A VIOLET TO GATHER FROM A COWSLIP WHICH HE SAYS IS NOT JUSTLY FOUNDED FOR HE HAS OBSERVED FREQUENTLY A BEE ON A LARGE BORDER GATHERING FROM FLOWERS OF DIFFERENT SPECIES IF M REAUMUR ONLY MEANS THAT WHEN THE BEE GATHERS HONEY IT TAKES IT INDIFFERENTLY FROM ANY FLOWER I CAN SAY NOTHING AGAINST IT BUT IF HE INTENDS IT TO MEAN THE BEES LOADING THE FARINA UPON ITS LEGS THEN MY OBSERVATION DIRECTLY CONTRA DICTS IT WHAT539 WHAT FURTHER CONFIRMS MY OBSERVATION IS THIS THAT EACH LOAD UPON THE LEGS OF A BEE IS OF ONE UNI FORM COLOUR THROUGHOUT AS A LIGHT RED AN ORANGE A YELLOW A WHITE OR A GREEN AND IS NOT UPON DIF FERENT PARTS OF THE LOAD OF A DIFFERENT COLOUR SO THAT AS THE FARINA OF EACH SPECIES OF FLOWERS WHEN COLLECTED TOGETHER IS OF ONE UNIFORM COLOUR THE PRESUMPTION IS THAT IT IS GATHERD FROM ONE SPECIES FOR IF FROM DIFFERENT KINDS PART OF THE LOAD MIGHT BE OF ONE COLOUR AND PART OF ANOTHER ANOTHER OBSERVATION TO CONFIRM THE SAME FACT IS THAT BEES IN THE HEIGHT OF THE SEASON RETURN TO THEIR HIVES WITH LOADS OF VERY DIFFERENT MAGNITUDES SOME HAVING LOADS AS GREAT AS SMALL SHOT WHILST OTHERS HAVE VERY SMALL LOADS IT CANNOT BE CON CEIVD THAT THIS DIFFERENCE IS FROM THE INACTIVITY OR SLOTH OF THE BEE IN COLLECTING ITS LOAD BUT RATHER FROM THE SCARCITY OF THE FLOWERS UPON WHICH IT FIRST BEGAN TO LOAD NOW IF THE FACTSARE SO AND MY OBSERVATIONS TRUE I THINK THAT PROVIDENCE HAS APPOINTED THE BEE TO BE VERY INSTRUMENTAL IN PROMOTING THE INCREASE OF VEGETABLES BUT OTHERWISE MIGHT BE VERY DETRI MENTAL TO THEIR PROPAGATION AND AT THE SAME TIME THEY CONTRIBUTE TO THE HEALTH AND LIFE OF THEIR OWN SPECIES FROM THE LATE IMPROVEMENT MADE BY GLASSES AND EXPERIMENTS MADE IN OBSERVING THE WORKS OF NA TURE IT IS ALMOST DEMONSTRABLE THAT THE FARINA UPON THE APICES OF FLOWERS IS THE MALE SEED WHICH EN TERING THE PISTILLUM OR MATRIX IN THE FLOWER IM PREGNATES THE OVUM AND MAKES IT PROLIFIC IT IS OFTEN NECESSARY TO HAVE WIND AND DRY WEATHER TO Z Z Z WAST540 WAST THIS FARINA TO THE PISTILLUM AND FROM FLOWER TO FLOWER TO MAKE THE SEED PROLIFIC AND WE FIND IN WET SEASONS THAT GRAIN NUTS AND FRUIT ARE LESS PROLIFIC BY THE FARINAS NOT BEING PROPERLY CON VEYD TO THE PISTILLUM AND ALSO IN VERY HOT DRY WEATHER FROM CLAMMY HONEYDEWS OR MORE PRO PERLY SWEET EXSUDATIONS FROM THE PLANTS THEMSELVES WHICH CLOGS THE FARINA AND CAUSES BLASTS AND MIL DEWS NOW IF THE FARINA OF SPECIFICALLY DIFFERENT FLOWERS SHOULD TAKE THE PLACE OF ITS OWN PROPER FARINA IN THE PISTILLUM LIKE AN UNNATURAL COITION IN THE ANIMAL WORLD EITHER NO GENERATION WOULD HAPPEN OR A MONSTROUS ONE OR AN INDIVIDUAL NOT CAPABLE OF FURTHER GENERATION NOW IF THE BEE IS APPOINTED BY PROVIDENCE TO GO ONLY AT EACH LOADING TO FLOWERS OF THE SAME SPE CIES AS THE ABUNDANT FARINA OFTEN COVERS THE WHOLE BEE AS WELL AS WHAT IT LOADS UPON ITS LEGS IT CAR RIES THE FARINA FROM FLOWER TO FLOWER AND BY ITS WALKING UPON THE PISTILLUM AND AGITATION OF ITS WINGS IT CONTRIBUTES GREATLY TO THE FARINAS ENTERING INTO THE PISTILLUM AND AT THE SAME TIME PREVENTS THE HETE ROGENEOUS MIXTURE OF THE FARINA OF DIFFERENT FLOW ERS WITH IT WHICH IF IT STRAYD FROM FLOWER TO FLOWER AT RANDOM IT WOULD CARRY TO FLOWERS OF A DIFFERENT SPECIES BESIDES THESE VISIBLE ADVANTAGES IT MAY BE OF GREAT BENEFIT TO THEIR OWN SPECIES AND SOCIETY FOR AS THIS FARINA IS THE NATURAL AND CONSTANT FOOD OF THE BEES DURING ONE HALF OF THE YEAR AND FROM THIS DIGESTED AS IT IS ACCURATELY OBSERVED BY M REAUMUR IS THE BOUILLEE AND JELLY FORMED WHICH IS LODGD FOR THE FOOD OF THE YOUNG BEES UNTIL THEY BECOME NYMPHAE541 NYMPHAE IT IS ALSO NECESSARY THAT STORES OF IT SHOULD BE LODGD IN THE CE LS ADJOINING TO THE HON Y FOR THEIR WINTER PROVISION WITHOUT WHICH MR REAU MUR OBSERVES THEY WOULD BE IN DANGER OF DYING OF A LOOSENESS THEIR MOST DANGEROUS MALADY IT SEEMS THEREFORE HIGHLY REASONABLE TO BELIEVE THAT DIFFERENT KINDS OF FARINA MAY HAVE DIFFERENT PHYSICAL QUALITIES SO THAT BY MAKING COLLECTIONS OF THE SAME KIND IN EACH CELL THEY MAY HAVE PRO PER REMEDIES FOR THEMSELVES AGAINST AILMENTS WE HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF WHICH OTHERWISE THEY WOULD NOT HAVE IF THEY WERE FILLED AT RANDOM FROM ALL KINDS OF FLOWERS THESE FURTHER ADVANTAGES DI RECTED TO THEM BY PROVIDENCE SEEM TO ADD WEIGHT TO MY OBSERVATIONS AND ARE A PRESUMPTIVE PROOF THAT THEY ARE TRUE THE ONLY THING BESIDES THE FORMER WHEREIN MY OB SERVATIONS DIFFER FROM MR REAUMUR IS IN THE MANNER THE WAX IS MADE AND EMITTED BY THE BEE I ABSO LUTELY CONCUR WITH HIM THAT THE WAX IS FORMED BY DIGESTION IN THE BODIES OF THE BEES AND IS EMITTED BY THEM AND THEN BECOMES WAX AND THAT IT IS ALMOST IMPRACTICABLE TO FORM WAX ANY OTHER WAY UNLESS THE WAX EXTRACTED FROM THE MYRTLEBERRIES IN AME RICA BY BOILING BE AN EXCEPTION FROM IT BY M REAUMURS OBSERVATIONS HE FORMS HIS OPI NION THAT AFTER THE BEE HAS FED UPON THE FARINA OR BEEBREAD AND IT HAS PASSD THROUGH THE FIRST STO MACH WHICH IS THE RESERVOIR WHERE THE HONEY IS LODGD FROM WHENCE IT IS DISCHARGD UPWARDS BY ITS MOUTH INTO THE CELLS IT IS CONVEYD INTO THE SECOND STOMACH AND YET WHEN THERE GREAT PART OF IT CON TINUES IN ITS SPHERICAL OR OVAL FORM STILL UNDIGESTED Z Z Z 2 AS542 AS VIEWD BY HIM WITH HIS GLASSES AND CONSEQUENTLY MUST BE CONVEYD FURTHER BEFORE IT BE THOROUGHLY DIGESTED AND THE PARTICLES BROKE YET THIS HE SUP POSES IS RECONVEYD UPWARDS THROUGH BOTH THE STO MACHS AND IS EMITTED BY ITS MOUTH AND FORMS HIS JUDGMENT FROM HIS OBSERVATION THAT THE BEE WHEN WORKING AND FINISHING THE CELLS NIPS WITH ITS TEETH THE WAX WHERE IT IS TOO THICK OR WRONG LAID AND HAS OBSERVED A MOTION OF ITS TONGUE AS IT WERE SMOOTHING OR LAYING ON MORE MATERIALS WHICH HE THINKS MUST BE THEN DISCHARGD FROM THE STOMACH BY ITS MOUTH WHAT MAKES ME DISAGREE WITH HIM IN HIS OPINION AND OBSERVATIONS IS FROM THE REMARKS I HAVE MADE THAT THE FAECES OF THE BEE DISCHARGD BY THE ANUS AFTER THE FARINA IS DIGESTED IS THE TRUE WAX WE MAY WITH TRUTH BELIEVE THAT THE FARINA WHICH IS THE MALE SEED OF ALL VEGETABLES CONSISTS OF A SPIRIT OR MOVING PRINCIPLE FLOATING IN A SWEET OIL SUR ROUNDED BY AN EXTERIOR COAT OR SHELL IN WHICH IS THAT MONADE THAT IMPREGNATES THE GRAIN OR FRUIT AND MAKES IT PROLIFIC THAT UPON SEPARATION OR DI GESTION THIS SPIRIT AND SWEET OIL BECOMES THE NOU RISHMENT OF THE BEE WHICH SPIRIT IS OF THE SAME NATURE WITH THE ANIMALCULES IN SEMINE MASCULINO OF ANIMALS AND BECOMES THE ANIMAL SPIRITS IN THE BEE AND OTHER ANIMALS AND PERHAPS THE TRUE HONEY IS THE SWEET OIL INCLUDED IN THE FARINA AND AS ALL VEGETABLES ABOUND WITH THESE VEGETABLE VIVIFYING ATOMS SINCE FROM MANY EVERY BUD IS CAPABLE OF INCREASING EACH SPECIES SO THE TRUE HONEY BREAKING THROUGH ITS SHELL BY GREAT HEAT OCCASIONS THOSE HONEY DEWS OBSERVD IN HOT WEATHER UPON THE LEAVES AND FLOWERS543 FLOWERS OF MOST VEGETABLES WHICH IS NO MORE THAN AN EXUDATION FROM THE LEAVES AND BLOSSOMS OF THESE VESSELS THAT BREAK WITH THE HEAT BESIDES THOSE THAT APPEAR ON THE APICES OF FLOWERS WHICH AFTERWARDS IMPREGNATES THE FRUIT OF THIS INWARD SUBSTANCE OF THE FARINA DILUTED WITH WATER AFTER DIGESTION IS FORMED THE BOUILLEE AND JELLY WHICH THE BEES DISCHARGE UPWARDS BY THE MOUTH INTO THE CELLS TO NOURISH THE YOUNG BEES UNTIL THEY BECOME NYMPHAE WHILST THE HUSK OR OUTER COAT IS DISCHARGD BY THE ANUS AND BECOMES THE GENUINE WAX I HAVE FREQUENTLY WHEN BEES HAVE BEEN SWARMING HAD THEM ALIGHT UPON MY HANDS AND CLOATHS AND MANY AT DIFFERENT TIMES HAVE DISCHARGED THEIR FAECES THEREUPON THIS I HAVE TAKEN OFF AND FOUND IT OF THE CONSISTENCE OF WARM WAX WITH THE SAME GLUTI NOUS ADHERING QUALITY NOT CRUMBLING LIKE THE FARINA I HAVE ALSO DISTINGUISHD IT BY THE SMELL TO BE WAX BUT IT HAD A HEAVIER STRONGER SMELL AS IT WAS FRESH AND WARM FROM THE BEE WHAT FURTHER CONFIRMED ME IN THIS FACT WAS FROM MY OBSERVATION OF THE BEES WHEN WORKING UP THEIR COMB IN A GLASS HIVE WHERE I HAVE CONSTANTLY SEEN AND MUST BELIEVE IT IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO BE OBSERVED BY SO ACCURATE AN OBSERVER AS M REAUMUR THAT SEVERAL BEES SOON AFTER ONE ANOTHER HAVE BY HASTY STEPS WALKD ALONG A COMB THEN FORMING FOR THE LENGTH OF TWO OR THREE CELLS BENDING THEIR TAILS TO THE COMB AND STRIKING IT WITH A WRIG GLING MOTION FROM SIDE TO SIDE IN A ZIGZAG WAY WHICH I WAS CONVINCED WAS DISCHARGING THEIR FAECES OR THE WAX AGAINST THE BORDER OF THE CELLS AS THEY544 THEY RAN ALONG AND REPEATED IT AS LONG AS THEY HAD ANY TO DISCHARGE AND THEN QUIT IT WHICH IS THE REASON WHY THE OUTWARD BORDER OF THE CELLS IS SO THICK AND STRONG AND IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS OTHER BEES CAME ALONG THE CELLS AND WITH THEIR FORE FEET RAISD UP THE BORDERS LIKE PASTE AND THINNING IT WHILST OTHER BEES WERE RIPPING OFF WITH THEIR TEETH AND PRUNING AWAY ANY IRREGULAR EXCRESCENCES SO AS TO MAKE THE DIVISIONS OF THE CELLS VASTLY THINNER THAN THE BORDERS OR EDGES WHICH WERE ALWAYS THICK AND STRONG FROM THE DISCHARGING THE FAECES OR WAX UPON THEM M REAUMUR HAS VERY JUSTLY OBSERVED THAT BESIDES THE THREE TRANSPARENT SMOOTH EYES WHICH THE BEE HAS PLACED IN A TRIANGLE BETWIXT THE ANTENNAE ON THE TOP OF ITS HEAD THE BEE HAS ALSO ON EACH SIDE OF ITS HEAD AN EYE OR RATHER A MULTITUDE OF EYES FORMD BY A NUMBER OF DISTINCT LENSS SURROUNDED EACH WITH SHORT HAIRS WHICH ARE CONFIRMD TO BE EYES BOTH FROM SWAMMERDAM AND HIS OWN EXPERIMENTS TO DETERMINE IT AND THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THESE LENSS ARE LIND WITH A DARK OPAQUE SUBSTANCE YET THEY ASSIST SO MUCH THEIR VISION THAT WHEN DARKENED BY PAINT LAID OVER THEM THE BEES COULD NOT FIND THEIR WAY TO THEIR HIVE THO AT A SMALL DISTANCE BUT SOARD DIRECTLY UPWARDS NOR COULD THEY FIND THEIR WAY WHEN THE THREE SMOOTH EYES WERE DARKENED BUT THERE IS ONE OBSERVATION WHICH I DONT FIND HE HAS MADE WHICH MAY HAVE DETERMINED THE GAR DEN BEES TO MAKE ALMOST ALL THEIR CELLS IMPERFECT HEXAGONS THE OBSERVATION IS THIS THAT THESE OPAQUE EYES ON EACH SIDE OF THE HEAD CONSIST OF MANY LENSS EACH OF WHICH IS A PERFECT HEXAGON AND THE WHOLE 1545 WHOLE EYE WHEN VIEWD IN A MICROSCOPE APPEARS EXACTLY LIKE A HONEYCOMB NOW AS THE EYES COM POSD OF THESE HEXAGONAL LENSS ARE IN FULL VIEW TO THE OTHER BEES DOES IT NOT SEEM THAT PROVIDENCE HAS DIRECTED THEM SO AS TO BE A PATTERN SET BEFORE THEM FOR THE BEES TO FOLLOW IN FORMING THEIR COMBS IS IT NOR ALSO REASONABLE TO BELIEVE FROM THE DISPRO PORTION OF THE CONVEXITY BETWIXT THE THREE SMOOTH TRANSPARENT EYES AND THE LENSS OF THE DARK ROUGH EYES THAT THEY ARE APPOINTED FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES WHY MAY IT NOT BE THOUGHT THAT THE LENSS ARE GREAT MAGNIFIERS TO VIEW THINGS NIGH AT HAND AND BY MANY REFLEXIONS TO CONVEY LIGHT INTO THE DARK HIVES WHERE LIGHT IS STILL NECESSARY AND THAT THE THREE OTHER EYES ARE TO OBSERVE OBJECTS AT A GREAT DISTANCE SO AS TO CONDUCT THEM ABROAD TO FIELDS AT A DISTANCE AND BACK AGAIN TO THEIR HIVES I AGREE WITH M REAUMUR IN THE FORM AND USE OF THE FANG OR TROMP OF THE WORKING BEE AND OF THE USE OF THE MOUTH WITHIN THE TEETH OF THE BEE SO THAT IT DOES NOT SUCK BUT LAPS OR LICKS WITH ITS ROUGH FANG OR TROMP LIKE A DOG BUT I HAVE NE VER OBSERVED THE BEE NIPPING OR BREAKING OPEN THE APICES OF FLOWERS TO LET OUT THE FARINA WHEN IT IS NOT FULLY BLOWN OR OPEN BUT HAVE OFTEN WITH PLEASURE OBSERVED THE BEE GATHERING THE FARINA UPON ITS FANG BY LICKING IT OFF THE APICES AND LAYING IT UPON THE FIRST PAIR OF LEGS WHICH CONVEY IT TO THE SECOND PAIR AND THESE LODGE IT UPON THE PALLET OF THE THIRD PAIR WITH SURPRISING BRISKNESS SO THAT BY THE TIME THE SECOND PAIR HAS LODGD IT UPON THE THIRD PAIR THE BEE HAS GATHERD MORE AND LODGD IT ON THE FORE LEGS SO THAT ALL ARE IN CONSTANT MOTION FROM546 FROM THE CURIOUS OBSERVATIONS MADE BY M REAUMUR UPON THE STRUCTURE AND BEHAVIOUR OF THE QUEEN OR MOTHER BEE THE DRONE OR MALE BEE AND THE WORKING OR MULE BEE WHICH IS OF NEITHER SEX FROM THE QUEEN BEES BEING SO EXCEEDINGLY PROLIFIC AS TO LAY FROM 30 TO 40000 EGGS OF WORKING BEES IN A SEASON BESIDES THE EGGS OF 800 MALE BEES AND OF EIGHT OR TEN QUEEN OR MOTHER BEES AND FROM THE COLDNESS OF THE MALE BEE WHO SO LONG RESISTS THE CARESSES OF THE QUEEN OR FEMALE BEE AND ALSO FROM THE INDEFATIGABLE LABOUR AND OECONOMY OF THE WORKING BEE TO NOURISH THE YOUNG BEES MAKE UP THE COMBS AND LAY IN STORES OF FARINA AND HONEY FOR WINTER I THINK VERY GOOD REASONS MAY BE GIVEN WHY THE QUEEN SHOULD HAVE A SERAGLIO OF SOME HUNDREDS OF MALE BEES AND WHY THE WORK ING BEE SHOULD DESTROY THE MALES WHEN NO LONGER NECESSARY TO IMPREGNATE THE EGGS OF THE MOTHER BEE IT IS EVIDENT FROM THE OECONOMY OF THE GARDEN BEE THAT PROVIDENCE HAS APPOINTED THAT THEY SHOULD SHARE THEIR STORE WITH MANKIND BY MAKING THEM SO INDUSTRIOUS IN EVERY CLIMATE AS TO PROVIDE IN TOLERABLE SEASONS A STORE OF HONEY AND WAX DOU BLE OF WHAT IS NECESSARY FOR THEIR SUBSISTENCE DURING THE WINTER AND OF COMBS FOR THE QUEENS LAYING HER EGGS IN SPRING BEFORE NEW WORK CAN BE MADE FROM THE VAST NUMBER OF EGGS WHICH THE QUEEN LAYS IN A SEASON IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE A GREAT STORE OF MALE SPERM TO IM PREGNATE HER EGGS AND AS THE EGGS ARE NOT SENSIBLY LARGE IN HER BODY FOR 6 MONTHS AFTER HER COITION WITH THE MALES WHO DIE OR ARE KILLED IN AUGUST AND SHE DOES NOT BEGIN TO LAY FROM THAT TIME TILL FEBRUARY547 FEBRUARY OR MARCH IT IS THEREFORE NECESSARY THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE A GREAT STORE OF MALE SPERM WITHIN HER TO IMPREGNATE ALL THE EGGS SHE LAYS FROM THAT TIME UNTIL JUNE OR JULY WHEN YOUNG DRONES OR MALES ARE HATCHD WHO ARE NOT DESIGNED FOR HER USE BUT FOR THE YOUNG QUEENS WHO GO OFF WITH THE SWARMS OR FOR THE YOUNG QUEEN WHO SUCCEEDS THE OLD ONE IN THE OLD HIVE SINCE THE DRONES ARE GREAT FEEDERS AND NO WORKERS AND ARE OF NO USE BUT TO GIVE A SUF CIENT STORE OF SPERM TO THE MOTHERBEE AS THE WORK ING BEES HAVE SO MANY ENEMIES TO DEPRIVE THEM OF THEIR STORE THEY CANT BE MAINTAIND DURING THE WINTER EVEN IF THEIR LIFE SHOULD LAST SO LONG AND AS IT IS PRO BABLE EACH MALE HAS BUT ONE ACT OF COITION WITH THE QUEEN AS THEY ARE SO COLD AND TAKE SO MUCH CARESSING BEFORE THEY ACT AND BY M REAUMURS OBSERVATION DIE SOON AFTER THE ACT IS OVER WHEN PROBABLY THEIR WHOLE STORE OF SPERM IS EXHAUSTED IN THAT ACT AS SOON AS THE QUEEN HAS GOT AS MUCH SPERM LODGD IN THE PROPER RESERVOIR AS IS SUFFICIENT TO IMPREGNATE ALL HER FUTURE EGGS THE MALES ARE NO LONGER OF USE AND IF THOSE WHO HAVE ACTED DIE THOSE WHO HAVE NOT BEING OF NO FURTHER USE ARE KILLED BY THE WORKING BEE OUT OF OECONOMY TO SAVE THEIR WINTER STORE WHEN PROBABLY BY NATURE THEY COULD LIVE BUT FEW DAYS MORE AS WE FIND THE SILKWORM MOTH DIES SOON AFTER THE EGGS ARE LAID AS WELL MALES AS FEMALES IT SEEMS THEREFORE NECES SARY THAT THE QUEEN SHOULD BREED SO MANY MALES AS BY ONE ACT OF COITION FROM EACH MAY IMPREGNATE ALL HER EGGS AND THAT THE WORKING BEE SHOULD DIS PATCH THEM AS SOON AS THAT IS OVERAND A STORE IS LODGD A A A A THERE548 THERE ARE TWO VESSELS DESCRIBD BY SWAMMERDAM IN THE MOTHERBEE WHOSE PLATE M REAUMUR HAS GIVEN IN HIS MEMOIRS ONE OF WHICH IS PLACED BE TWIXT THE TWO LOBES OF THE OVARIUM WHICH HE SUP POSES TO BE A BLADDER TO CONTAIN AIR THE OTHER IS A SPHERICAL VESSEL SEATED CLOSE BY THE COMMON DUCT IN WHICH THE EGGS FALL FROM THE LOBES OF THE OVA RIUM WHICH HE SUPPOSES IS TO OOZE OUT A JUICE TO MOISTEN THE EGGS IN THEIR PASSAGE I TAKE ONE OF THESE BUT MOST PROBABLY THE LAST TO BE THE RESER VOIR AND REPOSITORY OF THE MALE SPERM WHEREIN IT IS LODGD FROM THE ACT OF COITION UNTIL THE EGGS ARE INLARGD AND PASS THRO THE ADJOINING DUCT FROM THE TWO LOBES OF THE OVARIUM SINCE THE PRESERVATION AND INCREASE OF BEES ARE EVI DENTLY BENEFICIAL TO THE PUBLIC I APPROVE VERY MUCH OF M REAUMURS INSTRUCTIONS IN DRIVING BEES FROM A FULL HIVE INTO AN EMPTY ONE IN CASE IT CAN BE DONE TIME ENOUGH TO HAVE NEW WORK SUFFICIENT FOR THE QUEEN TO LAY HER EGGS IN IN SPRING SINCE THEY CAN BE FED AT VERY LITTLE EXPENCE IF CARE BE TAKEN TO KEEP THEM IN A MIDDLE STATE OF STUPEFACTION NEITHER TOO HOT NOR COLD DURING THE WINTER BUT I APPROVE MUCH MORE OF HIS CASTRATING OR SHARING THE COMBS WITH THE BEES BY TAKING THE COMBS BEST STORD WITH HONEY AND LEAVING THOSE WHEREIN ARE THE NYMPHAE AND BEE BREAD BUT THINK IN TAKING THE COMBS A SAFER AND EASIER WAY MAY BE TAKEN THAN HE DIRECTS HIS ME THOD IS TO STUPEFY THE BEES WITH SMOKE TO OBLIGE THEM TO CROUD TOGETHER IN THE CROWN OF THE HIVE AND THEN TURNING UP THE HIVE AND CUTTING OUT THE COMBS FILLD WITH HONEY NOW I THINK THAT TURN ING UP THE FULL HIVE AND SETTING AN EMPTY HIVE UPON IT549 IT AND DRIVING THE BEES INTO IT IS PREFERABLE TO SMOKING FOR THEN A VERY FEW BEES WILL REMAIN IN THE FULL HIVE AND THOSE FEW MAY BE STUPEFIED AND THE BEES IN THE EMPTY HIVE BEING PUT ON A TABLE THE COMBS MAY BE TAKEN OUT AND SELECTED AT LEISURE WITHOUT HAZARD AND AFTERWARDS THE EMPTY HIVE MAY BE TURND UP AND THEIR OLD HIVE SET OVER THEM SO THAT THEY WILL GO UP WITHOUT SCRUPLE INTO THEIR FORMER HIVE AND REPAIR THEIR WORK BY MAKING NEW COMBS AND IF THE QUEEN HAD NOT QUITTED THE OLD HIVE AS IS OFTEN THE CASE THEN THEY WOULD RETURN TO THEIR QUEEN AND THE SOCIETY WOULD NOT BE LOST AS IS SOMETIMES THE CASE IN DRIVING INTO AN EMPTY HIVE THESE SIR ARE THE FEW REMARKS I HAVE MADE ON REVISING M REAUMURS CURIOUS OBSERVATIONS ON BEES WHICH I THOUGHT INCUMBENT UPON ME TO SEND YOU TO LAY BEFORE YOUR LEARNED SOCIETY IF IT MAY CON TRIBUTE TOWARDS FINISHING THE NATURAL HISTORY OF BEES I SHALL TAKE UP NO MORE OF YOUR TIME THAN TO AS SURE YOU THAT I AM WITH THE GREATEST REGARD S I R YOUR MOST OBEDIENT AND MOST HUMBLE SERVANT

Ameri can Association for the Advancement of Sci ence during convocation week and that in consequence the usual Thanksgiving meeting at Chicago would be omitted ERNEST MERRITT Secretary THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY NORTH EASTERN SECTION THE seventyeighth regular meeting of the section was held at the Richardson Hotel Lowell Mass on October 25 at 730 PM VicePresident F G Stantial in the chair Fortytwo members and guests were present Professor Louis A Olney of the Lowell Textile School president of the section pre sented a paper upon  Standard Methods of Determining and Recording the Relative Per manency or Resistance of Coloring Matters to the Common Color Destroying Agencies In general the value of a dyestuff depends upon its resistance to the ordinary color weakening or destroying agencies or to use the terms of the trade upon its fastness Other properties must also be considered in the ultimate valuation of a dyestuff namely its solubility its affinity for fibers and its equalizing power The qualities demanded of any particular coloring matter depend upon the conditions to which its uses will necessarily subject it there fore the requirements vary greatly Taking any dyestuff at random we may find it to be particularly well suited for one branch of textile work and wholly unfit for another With the numerous variations in require ments the question of fastness becomes of great importance and much responsibility rests with the textile colorist in the selection of the proper dyestuffs in any particular case  If standard methods could be established whereby the relative fastness of dyestuffs to the common color destroying agencies could be determined and the results recorded in such a manner as to permit of their being used as standards of general reference the problem could be very much simplified and the reports given in regard to the properties of dyestuffs more reliable It was the purpose of the paper to show that the establishment of standard methods was by no means an impossibility and to make cer tain suggestions which had resulted from work carried on at the Lowell Textile School during a period of five years with the object of formulating such methods While the speaker was by no means ready to offer such a718 SCIENCE N S VOL XXVI No 673 series of tests in what he could call a per fected form he did wish to present for the consideration of the members certain phases of the work which had been done The principal colordestroying or changing agencies toward which the fastness of dyestuffs are usually tested may be enumerated as fol lows Fastness to light fastness to weather fastness to washing fastness to scouring fast ness to milling including felting and fulling fastness to alkalies fastness to acids fastness to chlorine fastness to sulphur dioxide fast ness to rubbing fastness to ironing and calendering fastness to steaming fastness to perspiration fastness to urine The paper then went into detail concerning the methods of determining the fastness of dyestuffs to the above agencies and also the methods of recording the same To make the record of a color complete certain other data were also recorded namely Its name dyestuff concern manufacturing or selling samples of the textile material dyed full shade and in various percentages to indicate its coloring value a detailed recipe of the process used in making the dyeings that are tested its solu bility color of its solution action of its solu tion with acids action of its solution with alkalies and finally three samples of dyed cotton and wool union material to indicate its affinity for the two important fibers and to give some idea as to its value for union dye ing The paper was accompanied by many dyed and tested samples which indicated the manner in which all of the above tests and determina tions of an individual color could be easily recorded upon a single folder of the proper size for an ordinary letter file In conclusion it was said that the tests de scribed had been formulated with the constant aim to make them as comparable as possible with the actual conditions of practise and that they had been revised each time that it was thought that any change would make them approach nearer to this desired condi tion In the opinion of the speaker they were subject to still further change and modifica tion but as he looked back to the series of tests made four and five years ago he felt that great improvement had been made He was inclined to believe that all of the members present who were directly interested in textile coloring would agree with him that great ad vances could be made if color dealers and textile manufacturers in general would agree upon certain standards of fastness and adopt uniform methods for making the various tests which at the present time are often so valueless because of lack of information as to how they were made Much could be accomplished by cooperation and it was sincerely hoped that the future would see an organized effort upon the part of those interested toward the establishment of such methods The paper was discussed at some length by members and guests At the close of the meeting a vote of thanks was passed to the Lowell members of the section for the enjoy able and instructive program and visits of the afternoon and evening and to the managers of the several industrial plants where visits were made for their courtesy and attention to the comfort and enjoyableness of the visits Preceding the meeting the members of the section were provided with a tempting lunch at the Lowell Textile School after which the various departments of the school were visited and the students observed at their work At 230 PM parties were formed to visit a the Bigelow Carpet Works b the Lawrence Hosiery Mill c the Lowell Gas Light Com pany d the Merrimack Print Works At all of these industrial plants the members were shown many interesting and instructive processes FRANK H THORP Secretary

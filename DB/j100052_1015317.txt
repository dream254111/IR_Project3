J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1015317,CAPITAL SHALL WE EXPORT IT OR USE IT FOR AMERICAN BUSINESS,I242687,CAPITAL SHALL WE EXPORT IT OR USE IT FOR AMERICAN BUSINESS BY GEORGE M REYNOLDS CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS CONTINENTAL AND COMMERCIAL NATIONAL BANK CHICAGO OREIGN TRADE FOR THE UNITED STATES IS BOTH NECESSARY AND DESIRABLE THERE IS NO DISAGREEMENT ON THIS POINT AMONG BANKERS BUSINESS MEN ECONOMISTS STATESMEN HOW EVER IN SEEKING A LEAD FOR THE REVIVAL OF AMERICAN BUSINESS ATTENTION SHOULD NOT BE FOCUSED ON FOREIGN TRADE TO THE EXCLUSION OF DOMESTIC BUSINESS AMER ICAN EXPORTS HAVE CONSTITUTED ONLY SOME SIX TO EIGHT PER CENT OF THE TOTAL SALES OF THIS COUNTRY DURING THE PERIOD OF MAXIMUM EXPORTS THE DOMESTIC MARKET IS DEFINITELY UNDER AMERICAN CONTROL TO BE REVIVED IF PROPER THOUGHT AND ACTION ARE TAKEN A CLEAR RAY OF HOPE OFFERS IN THE THOUGHT THAT MEAS URES LOOKING TOWARD BUSINESS REVIVAL CAN BE TAKEN AT HOME AND AT ONCE THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT FOREIGN TRADE PARTICULARLY IN CERTAIN COMMODITIES IS NOT IMPORTANT IT DOES MEAN THAT THE KEY TO BUSINESS REVIVAL LIES IN THE DOMESTIC MARKET AND A MORE NORMAL FOREIGN TRADE THAN THAT OF THE CALENDAR YEARS 19151920 THE PLACE OF FOREIGN TRADE IN AMERICAN BUSINESS THE BASIC FACTORS WHICH DETERMINE THE CHARACTER AND SCOPE OF A COUNTRYS FOREIGN TRADE WILL OPERATE TO CAUSE THE UNITED STATES TO SEEK OUT CERTAIN COM MODITIES NEEDED AND TO EXPORT COM MODITIES IN THE PRODUCTION OF WHICH THE UNITED STATES HAS THE GREATEST COM PARATIVE ADVANTAGES THE CLIMATE OF THE UNITED STATES PREVENTS THE PRODUCTION OF CERTAIN COMMODITIES NEEDED SUCH AS TEA COFFEE RAW SILK RUBBER COCOA SISAL JUTE THESE MUST BE BOUGHT IN THE COUNTRIES WHERE THEY CAN BE PRODUCED IT SO HAPPENS THAT THE PRODUCTS DENIED THE UNITED STATES BY CLIMATIC CONDITIONS ARE FOUND IN TROPICAL COUNTRIES WHICH WANT AND DO NOT PRODUCE THE COMMOD ITIES THIS COUNTRY CAN AND DOES PRODUCE DIRECT TRADING WITH SUCH COUNTRIES IS THEREFORE NATURAL THE UNITED STATES CAN EXPORT GOODS IN THE PRODUCTION OF WHICH IT HAS THE GREATEST COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGES DUE TO CLIMATE NATURAL RESOURCES AND THE GENIUS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FOR ORGANIZATION AND QUANTITY PRODUCTION IN RESOURCES THE UNITED STATES EXCELS IN IRON SILVER LUMBER COPPER AND OTHER WELLKNOWN BASIC MATERIALS SOIL AND CLIMATE COMBINE TO GIVE AN ADVANTAGE IN THE PRODUCTION OF SUCH GOODS AS GRAIN COTTON MEAT AND DAIRY PRODUCTS THE GENIUS OF AMERICANS HAS FOUND CHARACTERISTIC EXPRESSION IN THE MASS PRODUCTION OF STANDARDIZED ARTICLES PARTICULARLY OF IRON AND STEEL IT ALSO HAS FOUND EXPRESSION IN SUCH DEVICES AS CASH REGISTERS ADDING MACHINES TYPE WRITERS SEWING MACHINES AND MANY SIMILAR ARTICLES OF CLEVER INVENTION IT SEEMS REASONABLY CLEAR THAT WHAT EVER IS THE PECULIAR PRODUCT OF THE CLIMATE OF THE UNITED STATES MAY BE SOLD EVERYWHERE BY AMERICANS IN THE FACE OF ANY COMPETITION WHATEVER PRODUCT IS BENEFITED BY PECULIARITY OF AMERICAN RESOURCES EITHER GREAT SUPPLY OR ACCESSIBILITY MAY LIKEWISE BE SOLD AGAINST COMPETITION IT IS PROBABLY NOT TOO STRONG A STATEMENT TO SAY THAT WHATEVER IS THE PECULIAR PRODUCT OF AMERICAN GENIUSWHETHER GENIUS FOR 1THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY INVENTION MASS PRODUCTION OR BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONMAY BE SOLD BY AMERI CANS IN THE FACE OF COMPETITION THESE INFLUENCES NOT ONLY MAKE POSSIBLE BUT EVEN COMPEL THE EXPORT OF CERTAIN GOODS IN SUM THE UNITED STATES CAN SELL IN ANY OPEN MARKET THE COMMODITIES IN THE PRODUCTION OF WHICH IT EXCELS THERE WILL BE AN INTERCHANGE OF GOODS WITH THOSE COUNTRIES WHICH CAN SUPPLY PRODUCTS NEEDED AND REQUIRE AMERI CAN GOODS THERE WILL BE A CONTINUING PRESSURE TO EXPORT GOODS TO EUROPE THOUGH THE TOTAL VALUE OF EXPORTS TO EUROPE HAS SHRUNK THE UNITED STATES WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK TO EUROPE TO PURCHASE COTTON AND OTHER PRODUCTS WHICH HAVE SO LONG BEEN MARKETED THERE INDEED IT SEEMS REASONABLY CERTAIN THAT THE UNITED STATES WILL HAVE A FAVORABLE BALANCE OF TRADE WITH EUROPE FOR SOME TIME THOUGH APPRE CIABLY LESS THAN INDICATED BY EXPORT FIGURES FOR THE WAR AND AFTERWAR PERIOD IT SCARCELY NEEDS TO BE SAID THAT FOREIGN MARKETS MUST BE AVAILABLE IN THE YEARS AHEAD FOR THOSE COMMODITIES WHICH HAVE COMPRISED THE MAJOR POR TION OF THE EXPORT TRADE OF THE UNITED STATES DURING THE PERIOD 19141920 HEADING THE LIST OF THESE COMMODITIES ARE RAW AND MANUFACTURED COTTON MANUFACTURES OF IRON AND STEEL BREAD STUFFS MEAT AND DAIRY PRODUCTS AND MINERAL OIL IT SEEMS LIKELY HOWEVER THAT THIS EXPORT TRADE OF THE UNITED STATES WILL CONFORM MORE AND MORE TO THE VALUE VOLUME AND TREND OF SUCH TRADE DURING THE PERIOD 19001913 RATHER THAN TO THE EXPORT TRADE BUILT UP THROUGH WAR CONDITIONS IN DETERMINING THE PLACE OF FOREIGN TRADE IT IS JUST AS IMPORTANT TO EMPHA SIZE THE POINT THAT FOREIGN TRADE IS BOTH NECESSARY AND DESIRABLE FOR THE UNITED STATES AS IT IS TO EMPHASIZE A SECOND POINT WHICH SEEMS SOMETIMES TO BE OVERLOOKED THAT A CONTINUATION OF ABNORMAL EXPORTS CANNOT BE EXPECTED AMERICAN EXPORTS MOUNTED BOTH IN VALUE AND VOLUME TO UNPRECEDENTED PROPORTIONS PARTICULARLY DURING THE YEARS 19151920 BUT ONCE THE STIM ULATION OF EXTRAORDINARY DEMAND AND DIRE NECESSITY WERE WITHDRAWN THERE WAS A NOTICEABLE DRIFT BACK TO TRADE MORE IN ALIGNMENT WITH PREWAR TRENDS ANY NOTION THAT THE UNITED STATES CAN GO ON INDEFINITELY SELLING ALL KINDS OF GOODS IN ALL MARKETS AT FANCY PRICES FINDS NO CONFIRMATION IN THE VIEWS OF EXPERTS WHO HAVE STUDIED CONDITIONS OR IN FOREIGN TRADE STATISTICS THE PROSPECT FOR THE REVIVAL OF AMER ICAN BUSINESS LIES IN THE INCREASE OF BUSINESS IN THE DOMESTIC MARKETS AND IN A FOREIGN TRADE MAINTAINED ALONG MORE NATURAL LINES AND DEVELOPED IN A MORE NORMAL WAY THAN IS SOMETIMES URGED BY THE PROPONENTS OF PLANS FOR THE ARTIFICIAL STIMULATION OF FOREIGN TRADE ULTIMATELY OF COURSE IF ALSO WHEN AND AS EUROPEAN COUNTRIES PAY THE INTEREST DUE THE UNITED STATES ON THEIR BORROWINGS AND TRY TO AMORTIZE THEIR DEBTS THESE PAYMENTS WILL BE MADE LARGELY IN GOODS AND AN UNFAVOR ABLE TRADE BALANCE OR STREAM OF MER CHANDISE IMPORTS IN EXCESS OF MERCHAN DISE EXPORTS MUST BE EXPECTED ANY LONG TIME APPRAISAL OF FOREIGN TRADE SOLELY IN TERMS OF EXPORTS IS FAULTY CLOSE THINKING MUST COMPASS THE PROB LEM OF IMPORTSAND TARIFFS IN APPROACHING THE PROBLEM OF BUS INESS REVIVAL IT IS TRUE THAT ACCOUNT MUST BE TAKEN OF THE FACT THAT ALTHOUGH THE EXPORT TRADE OF THE UNITED STATES HAS CONSTITUTED ONLY SOME SIX TO EIGHT PER CENT OF TOTAL SALES DURING THE YEARS WHEN EXPORTS WERE AT THEIR HEIGHT THIS COMPARATIVELY SMALL VOLUME OF SALES HAS A DISPROPORTIONATE SIGNIFICANCE PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO THOSE COM MODITIES IN THE PRODUCTION OF WHICH THE UNITED STATES ENJOYS DISTINCT ADVAN TAGES EXPORT TRADE CONFORMING MORE 2SOME MORE THAN OTHERSMUST DO ALL THESE THINGS BUT MORE THEY MUST PUT SUCH RESTRICTIONS ON IMPORTS AS TO BAR OUT GOODS THAT ARE NOT VITALLY NECESSARY FOR THEIR REHABILITATION IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE EUROPEAN COUN TRIES WORK TAX SAVE RESTRICT IMPORTS TO NECESSITIESAND ABOVE ALL REVERSE THE MAD POLICY OF PRINTING BANK NOTES ON THESE POINTS ECONOMISTS ARE IN AGREEMENT IF CONTINENTAL EUROPE DOES NOT SHOW A DISPOSITION TO PUT HER HOUSE IN ORDER IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO SUGGEST THAT BRITISH AND AMERICAN FINANCIERS AS WELL AS THE GOVERNMENTS OF GREAT BRITAIN AND THE UNITED STATES SHOULD EXERT AT LEAST MORAL PRESSURE TO BRING ABOUT THIS RESULT THE UNITED STATES COULD EVEN LAY DOWN AS A CONDITION PRECEDENT TO ITS FINANCIAL COOPERATION OR AID SERIOUS AND INTELLIGENT EFFORTS AT FINAN CIAL AND MONETARY REHABILITATION BY THE COUNTRIES OF EUROPE IT IS NOT AMISS TO NOTE THAT EFFORTS TO CORRECT THE ILLBALANCED FINANCIAL POSI TION OF EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WILL AFFECT THE VOLUME OF AMERICAN EXPORTS TO EUROPE THESE EXPORTS ARE NOW DI MINISHING BECAUSE OF THE HIGH PREMIUM THE DOLLAR COMMANDS IN OTHER CURREN CIES THE POINT SHOULD NOT BE LOST SIGHT OF THAT ONE OF THE CHIEF INFLUENCES AFFECTING EXCHANGE RATES ARE DIFFER ENCES IN THE PRICE LEVELS IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES IT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN FACT AS IN THEORY THAT THE PARITY OF EXCHANGE BETWEEN TWO COUNTRIES IS AFFECTED BY THE PURCHASING POWER OF THE MONIES OF THOSE TWO COUNTRIES IF INFLATION IS NOT CHECKED OR APPRECIABLY REDUCED EXCHANGE RATES MUST OBTAIN WHICH WILL OPERATE AS A BARRIER TO THE EXPORTATION OF AMERICAN GOODS TO EUROPE IF FRANCE FOR INSTANCE MAKES NO SERIOUS EFFORT AT DEFLATION AND AMERICA IS SUCCESSFUL IN ITS DEFLATIONARY PROCESS THE RATIO BETWEEN THE PRICE LEVELS IN THE TWO COUNTRIES WILL SHOW AN CLOSELY TO THE DOCTRINE OF COMPARA TIVE COSTS IS AS INEVITABLE AS IT IS DESIRABLE BEFORE DEVELOPING THE REMAINING POINTS IN THIS PAPER THAT EUROPE SHOULD TAKE STEPS TO HELP HERSELF AND THAT THE EXPORT OF CAPITAL HAS A DISTINCT EFFECT ON BUSINESS REVIVAL IT IS NECESSARY TO SOUND THE WARNING THAT SUCH ARGU MENTS SET UP NO BRIEF AGAINST THE POSI TION THAT NATURAL TRENDS OF FOREIGN TRADE ARE NECESSARY FOR THE UNITED STATES WHAT EUROPE SHOULD DO THE WORLD AS A COMMUNITY OF NA TIONS ENGAGED IN TRADE IS IN AN ILLBAL ANCED FINANCIAL POSITION THE UNITED STATES AND IN MUCH LESS DEGREE GREAT BRITAIN ARE THE ONLY COUNTRIES WITH AN APPRECIABLE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL FOR EXPORT FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAINTAIN ING THEIR OWN FINANCIAL SOLIDITY THESE TWO COUNTRIES CAN ILLAFFORD TO SUPPLY CONTINENTAL EUROPE WITH FUNDS SECURED THROUGH BANK EXPANSION IN FACT THEY CAN PROPERLY URGE THAT THE CON TINENTAL COUNTRIES TAKE STEPS TO STRAIGHT EN OUT THEIR FINANCES AS A MATTER OF GOOD FAITH IF NOTHING MORE BEFORE SEEKING EXTENSIVE FINANCIAL AID REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE NATIONS OF CONTINENTAL EUROPE HAVE MADE SMALL PROGRESS IN BALANCING THEIR BUDGETS DEFICITS HAVE ACCUMULATED THESE NATIONS MUST MAKE SERIOUS EFFORTS TO IMPROVE PUBLIC FINANCES THIS COURSE INVOLVES STRINGENT MEASURES IN THE WAY OF DEFLATING INFLATED PAPER CURRENCIES IT ALSO INVOLVES TAXATION OF THE MOST RIGOROUS CHARACTER THERE MUST BE RE TRENCHMENT IN PUBLIC EXPENDITURES INTERNAL FUNDING LOANS OF GREATER PRO PORTIONS WILL DOUBTLESS BE NECESSARY TO REDUCE FLOATING DEBTSPARTICULARLY TO REDUCE DEBTS TO THE STATE BANKS OF ISSUE SO AS TO BRING ABOUT A REDUCTION IN THE VOLUME OF OUTSTANDING BANK NOTES IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT EUROPEAN NATIONS CAPITAL 3THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY EVEN WIDER DISPARITY AND BUYING BY FRANCE IN AMERICA WILL BE INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT IT IS PROBABLY SAFE TO SAY THAT VARIATION IN PRICE LEVELS MONETARY STANDARDS AND POLITICS NOW HAVE A MAJOR INFLUENCE ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE A GREATER INFLUENCE THAN TRADE BALANCES ONE OF THE CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR NORMAL TRADING BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE IS THEREFORE THAT EUROPEAN COUNTRIES SHALL THEMSELVES TAKE CLEARLY DEFINED STEPS TO STRENGTHEN THEIR EXCHANGE POSITION MOREOVER EUROPE SHOULD FIRST HELP HERSELF BEFORE SEEKING LARGE AMOUNTS OF NEW CAPITAL IN THE AMERICAN MARKET THIS IS NECESSARY AS A MATTER OF GOOD FAITH AS A COMMON SENSE WAY OF STRENGTHEN ING HER POSITION WITH REGARD TO MAKING SECURITIES ATTRACTIVE IN THE AMERICAN MARKET RHE EXPORT OF AMERICAN CAPITAL THE EXTENT TO WHICH EUROPEAN NATIONS HAVE BEEN SECURING CAPITAL IN THE AMERICAN MARKET MAY NOT BE FULLY COMPREHENDED DURING THE PE RIOD 19151920 FOREIGN LOANS FLOATED THROUGH AMERICAN BANKERS AGGREGATED SOME FIVE BILLION DOLLARS DIRECT LOANS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO EURO PEAN NATIONS AMOUNTED TO SOME TEN BILLION DOLLARS AT THE PRESENT TIME THE UNFUNDED DEBT OF EUROPE PROBABLY AMOUNTS TO SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THREE AND ONEHALF AND FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN ALL THESE FIGURES REPRESENT AN EXPORT OF SOMETHING LIKE NINETEEN BILLIONS OF CAPITAL TO SHOW THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE FIGURES A COMPARISON MAY BE NOTED DURING THE PERIOD 19151920 THE TOTAL REPORTED ISSUES OF SECURITIESRAILROAD AND TRACTION INDUSTRIAL MUNICIPAL AND STATE AND THOSE PUT OUT BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENTAMOUNTED TO FORTYTHREE AND ONEHALF BILLION DOLLARS OF THAT TOTAL FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS WENT TO EUROPE EUROPEANS RECEIVED THREE BIL LIONS MORE THAN WERE GIVEN TO ALL AMER ICAN RAILROADS TRACTION COMPANIES AND INDUSTRIES COMBINED THEY RECEIVED AS MUCH AS THESE WITH STATE AND MUNIC IPAL ISSUES ADDED JUSTIFICATION FOR PROPOSALS TO FURNISH EUROPE WITH EVEN MORE CAPITAL IS SOUGHT IN THE PLEA THAT THE FORTUNES OF THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES ARE TIED UP WITH THOSE OF EUROPE FAILURE DISTRESS AND DISASTER THERE WILL MEAN FAILURE DISTRESS AND DISASTER HERE THE VIEW IS URGED THAT AMERICAN GOODS PARTICULARLY RAW MATERIALS MUST BE SOLD TO EUROPEANS NOT ONLY IN ORDER TO RELIEVE THE AMERICAN MARKET BUT ALSO TO FURNISH EUROPE THE MATERIALS ON WHICH TO WORK IN THE PROCESS OF ECO NOMIC REHABILITATION ANY PROPOSAL TO FURNISH EUROPE WITH MORE CAPITAL SHOULD RECEIVE THE CLOSEST SCRUTINY IN MANY STATEMENTS REGARDING THE SUBJECT OF EXPORTING CAPITAL THE IDEA SEEMS TO BE PREVALENT THAT MONEY IS THE ONLY FORM OF CAPITAL IF THE UNITED STATES MAKES LOANS TO FRANCE AND THE PROCEEDS OF THE LOANS ARE EXPENDED IN THE UNITED STATES IT IS FELT THAT AMER ICANS WILL BE SAFE BECAUSE THE MONEY IS STILL HERE BUT IN SUCH CASE THEY HAVE PARTED WITH CAPITAL GOODS WHICH HAVE BEEN PAID FOR WITH THEIR OWN FUNDS THEY WILL RECEIVE FOR THESE CAPITAL GOODS THE CUSTOMARY EVIDENCES OF DEBT BONDS OR NOTES WHICH DRAW INTEREST THIS IS AS TRULY AN EXPORT OF CAPITAL AS IF GOLD HAD BEEN SENT ABROAD AND AMERICANS HAVE IDENTICAL EVIDENCE IN EITHER CASE AMERICAN CAPITAL RESOURCES HAVE BEEN DEPLETED TO THE SAME EXTENT IN EITHER CASE IT IS IMMATERIAL WHETHER THE RECENT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR FRENCH LOAN WAS MADE IN GOODS OR IN GOLD SO FAR AS THIS COUNTRYS CAPITAL ACCOUNT IS CONCERNED THINKING ABOUT THE EXPORT OF CAPITAL SHOULD NOT BE CONFUSED BY CENTERING ATTENTION ON MONEY AND FORGETTING THE FACT THAT CAPITAL GOODS ARE EXPORTED EVEN THOUGH 4CAPITAL THE MONEY MAY BE SPENT IN THIS COUNTRY MUCH THE SAME SITUATION UNDERLIES THE PLAN FOR THE PROPOSED HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR FOREIGN TRADE FINANC ING CORPORATION IT IS A PLAN TO EXPORT SOME PART OR ALL OF A BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF CAPITAL CHIEFLY TO EUROPE IT IS A PLAN TO STIMULATE EXPORTS BUT IT INVOLVES THE EXPORT OF CAPITAL GOODS IN RETURN FOR WHICH AMERICANS WOULD RECEIVE INTEREST BEARING PROMISES TO PAY THE RELUCTANCE OF MANY OF THE LARGER BANKS TO FURNISH CAPITAL FOR THE ORGAN IZATION OF THIS CORPORATION IN SUCH LARGE AMOUNTS AS HAVE BEEN ASKED IS NO DOUBT DUE TO THE KNOWLEDGE BANKERS HAVE OF THE ENORMOUS LOSSES SUSTAINED BY FOREIGN FINANCING COMPANIES DURING THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND THE FURTHER KNOWLEDGE OF THE FACT THAT ALMOST EVERY FOREIGN DOCK HAS BEEN FILLED WITH GOODS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN ACCEPTED BY FOREIGN BUYERS IT IS A MATTER OF COMMON KNOWLEDGE THAT EUROPEAN NATIONS OWE THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT ABOUT TEN BILLION DOLLARS PAYMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT IS REGARDED IN SOME QUARTERS AS PROBLEMATIC PAYMENT OF THE INTEREST CHARGES HAS BEEN DEFERRED BUT IF PAYMENT IS MADE OF BOTH PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST SUCH PAYMENT MUST BE MADE LARGELY IN GOODS THAT IS THE BALANCE OF TRADE OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS MUST RUN IN FAVOR OF THE OBLIGATED NATIONS AND BE UNFAVORABLE TO THE UNITED STATES UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES IT IS POSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND THE ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF THE CANCELLATION OF THE DEBT OWED BY EUROPEAN NATIONS TO THE FEDERAL GOV ERNMENT HOWEVER IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT ANY SUCH PROPOSAL CAN BE SERIOUSLY ENTERTAINED BOTH BECAUSE IT IS CONTRARY TO THE TREND OF PUBLIC OPINION IN THE UNITED STATES AND BECAUSE IT MIGHT NOT BE ACQUIESCED IN ABROAD THEREFORE THE LONG RUN VIEW OF THE EFFECT OF CAPITAL ADVANCES TO EUROPE AND THE PAYMENT OF INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL MUST COMPASS THE QUESTION OF IMPORTS AND ULTIMATE UNFAVORABLE TRADE BALANCES EVEN IF PROPOSED PLANS FOR FINANCING EUROPE ARE NOT BROUGHT TO THE POINT OF EXECUTION THE PREVENTION OF FOREIGN RAIDS ON AMERICAN CAPITAL RESOURCES IS WORTHY OF SERIOUS THOUGHT THE GER MAN WAR INDEMNITY BONDS ARE AN ILLUSTRATION IT IS REPORTED THAT ON JULY 1 SERIES A OF THE GERMAN WAR INDEMNITY BONDS TO THE AMOUNT OF THREE BILLION DOLLARS WILL BE ISSUED SERIES B NINE BILLIONS IN AMOUNT WILL BE ISSUED NOVEMBER 1 NEXT THE INTEREST RATE WILL BE FIVE PER CENT SERIES C BONDS WILL AMOUNT TO TWENTYONE BILLION DOLLARS AND WILL BE ISSUED UNDER DETAILED PROVISIONS WHICH NEED NOT NOW BE CONSIDEREDL THE UNITED STATES WILL RECEIVE NONE OF THESE BONDS NOR INDEMNITY PAYMENTS OF ANY KIND NEVERTHELESS THE GOV ERNMENTS THAT DO RECEIVE THE BONDS WILL PROBABLY TRY TO MARKET THEM IN THE UNITED STATES AS IT IS THE ONLY GREAT UNRESTRICTED INVESTMENT MARKET EURO PEAN NATIONS WILL COMMAND NEW AMER ICAN CAPITAL TO THE EXTENT THAT THE BONDS ARE BOUGHT BY AMERICAN IN VESTORS IN ANY DISCUSSION OF AMERICAS PART IN EUROPEAN REHABILITATION THE QUES TION OF THE EXPORT OF CAPITAL FROM AMER ICA IS A PRIMARY NOT A SECONDARY MAT TER THIS FACT HAS ALREADY BEEN SHOWN BY THE LARGE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL FUR NISHED EUROPESOME NINETEEN BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THE PROMOTERS OF THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR FOREIGN TRADE FINANCING CORPORATION HAVE URGED THAT THE UNITED STATES IS MORALLY BOUND TO HELP EUROPE AND SELFISHLY CONCERNED IN DEVELOPING EXPORT TRADE IF IT WOULD MAINTAIN OR REVIVE DOMESTIC FOR A DETAILED STATEMENT REGARDING THE IS SUANCE OF THE GERMAN INDEMNITY BONDS SEE THE ARTICLE BY MR MCDONALD IN THIS VOLUMEED 5THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY PROSPERITY BUT NO PLAN HAS YET BEEN PROPOSED THAT DOES NOT IN EFFECT PROVIDE MERELY FOR THE WHOLESALE GRANTING OF COMMODITY CREDITS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS OR OTHER PRO POSALS TO FURNISH EUROPE WITH CAPITAL IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT PERSISTENT REFUSAL TO COOPERATE IN ANY WAY WITH EUROPE WOULD HAVE A SERIOUS REACTION ON INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED STATES ABOUT THIS POINT THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT HOWEVER THE UNITED STATES OWES TO EUROPE AS WELL AS ITSELF THE DUTY OF KEEPING ITS HOUSE IN ORDER IF THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT DO THE BEST IT CAN WITH ITS OWN RESOURCES IT WILL DO LESS THAN IS POSSIBLE FOR EUROPE IN CONSIDERING FOREIGN TRADE AND THE EXPORT OF AMERICAN CAPITAL NOT ONLY THE NEEDS OR DEMANDS OF EUROPE MUST BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT BUT ALSO THE CAPACITY OF AMERICANS TO EXPORT CAPI TAL WITHOUT SERIOUSLY AFFECTING DOMESTIC INDUSTRY EUROPE WOULD NOT GAIN IN THE LONG RUN FROM THE IMPAIRMENT OF AMERICAN RESOURCES AND CAPITAL TOO MUCH EMPHASIS CAN BE PLACED ON WHAT AMERICA CAN DO FOR EUROPE AND NOT ENOUGH ON WHAT EUROPE CAN AND MUST DO FOR HERSELF EUROPEAN COUNTRIES OWE AMERICA THE DUTY OF RIGHTING THEIR ECONOMIC POSITION BY STRONG ADHERENCE TO SOUND AND SANE RULES OF FINANCING TAXATION AND FISCAL OPERATIONS IT IS IMPORTANT THAT ATTENTION BE GIVEN THE NEEDS OF EUROPE FOR CAPITAL BUT IT IS NECESSARY ALSO TO CONSIDER AMERICAN NEEDS AMERICAS NEED OF CAPITAL NO RECOURSE TO STATISTICS IS REALLY NECESSARY TO CONFIRM THE TRUTH OF THE STATEMENTS SO OFTEN MADE THAT AMERI CAN RAILROADS HAVE NOT RECEIVED FOR SEVERAL YEARS ADEQUATE ADDITIONS TO THEIR CAPITALADDITIONS WHICH WERE NECESSARY TO EFFICIENT TRANSPORTATION SERVICE IT IS COMMON KNOWLEDGE THAT RENEWALS ADDITIONS AND BETTERMENTS ARE NEEDED SOME IDEA OF THE SITUA TION HOWEVER CAN BE GAINED FROM THE FACT THAT REPORTED ISSUES OF RAILROAD AND TRACTION SECURITIES FROM 1909 TO 1914 AVERAGED ALMOST ONE BILLION DOL LARS EACH YEAR WHILE FROM 1917 TO 1920 INCLUSIVE THE AVERAGE WAS LESS THAN FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IT SEEMS A REASONABLE INFERENCE THAT THE EXPORT OF AMERICAN CAPITAL TO EUROPE MUST HAVE HELPED TO STAY RAIL ROAD PROGRESS AND DEVELOPMENT SIM ILARLY THE EXPORT OF AMERICAN CAPITAL MUST HAVE HAD AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON BUILDING OPERATIONS AND MUST HAVE BEEN A CONTRIBUTING CAUSE TO THE PRESENT HOUSING SHORTAGE CAPITAL NEEDS FOR BUILDING ARE PROBLEMATIC ESTIMATES RANGE FROM ONE TO FIVE BILLION DOLLARS EVEN THE MOST CONSERVATIVE FIGURES HOWEVER SHOW THE NEED FOR CAPITAL IN THE UNITED STATES IF BUILDING IS TO PLAY ITS FULL PART IN THE RESTORATION OF DOMES TIC PROSPERITY INDEED IN EVERY FIELD OF DOMESTIC ENDEAVOR THE SHORTAGE OF CAPITAL EVIDENCED BY HIGH INTEREST RATES HAS BEEN MORE OR LESS SERIOUSLY FELT AND ALTHOUGH THE UNITED STATES IS NOW A CREDITOR NATION IT MUST BE RE CALLED THAT AT NO TIME IN ITS HISTORY PRIOR TO THE WAR HAVE THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES ACCUMULATED ENOUGH CAPITAL FOR AMERICAN NEEDS THE UNITED STATES WAS REGULARLY A DEBTOR NATION INTEREST RATES BUSINESS MEN IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN GREATLY DISTURBED OVER HIGH INTEREST RATES BANKERS HOWEVER ARE NOT TO BE CHARGED WITH THE RESPONSI BILITY FOR THIS CONDITION THERE HAS NOT BEEN ENOUGH CAPITAL TO MEET THE DEMAND AT LOW INTEREST RATES BIDDING FOR THE AVAILABLE SUPPLY OF CAPITAL HAS BEEN VIGOROUS AND ALWAYS IN COMPETI TION WITH HARDPRESSED EUROPEAN COUN TRIES THE PROSPECT OF LOWER INTEREST RATES IS REMOTE UNLESS THE DEMAND FOR 6INCOME MAY BE MUST COME ALL EXPENDI TURES FOR COMFORTS LUXURIES TAXES AND ALSO CAPITAL WHETHER FOR AMERICAN INDUSTRY OR FOR FOREIGNERS OR BOTH IN CONSIDERING THE POSSIBLE SAVINGS OF THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES IT IS HELPFUL TO DIVIDE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF FAMILIES INTO INCOME GROUPS FAMILIES WITH INCOMES OF 1500 OR LESS CAN SAVE PRACTICALLY NOTHING FAMILIES WHOSE INCOMES RANGE FROM 1500 TO 5000 ARE DISPOSED TO SPEND RATHER THAN SAVE AFTER MAKING THEIR CUSTOMARY INVEST MENTS IN INSURANCE AND HOMES FAM ILIES WITH INCOMES ABOVE 5000 HAVE HAD THEIR RESOURCES EATEN INTO BY INCOME AND SURTAXES WHILE THE GREATER PRO PORTION OF CAPITAL ACCUMULATIONS DURING THE PERIOD 1900 TO 1910 CAME FROM THE LAST NAMED GROUP AND FROM COR PORATION SURPLUSES INCOME AND PROFITS TAXES HAVE CUT HEAVILY INTO WHAT MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN INDUSTRIAL CAPITAL IF THE TAX PROGRAM OF THE UNITED STATES COULD BE RADICALLY REVISED THIS SOURCE OF CAPITAL WOULD BE RESTORED BUT IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT SUCH MODIFICATION OF TAX RATES WILL BE MADE AS TO RESTORE THE POSITION OF THE WELLTODO OR COR PORATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THIS MATTER OF FURNISHING CAPITAL WITH THE SAVINGS POWER OF THE HIGH INCOME GROUP SERI OUSLY IMPAIRED AND THE LOW INCOME GROUP WITHOUT FINANCIAL LEEWAY DE PENDENCE FOR CAPITAL RESTS MORE LARGELY ON THE MIDDLE INCOME GROUPFAMILIES WITH INCOMES FROM 1500 TO 5000 A YEAR IF SAVINGS CANNOT BE INDEFINITELY INCREASED THE QUESTION ARISES TO WHAT USE SHALL CAPITAL ACCUMULATIONS BE PUT SHALL THEY BE TURNED IN LARGE MEASURE TO EUROPE OR PUT TO WORK IN THE UNITED STATES SINCE SAVINGS ARE NOT INDEFI NITELY EXPANSIBLE A DECISION IS NECESSARY AS TO WHETHER THEY SHALL BE SPENT HERE TO FURNISH EUROPEANS WITH CAPITAL GOODS OR SPENT HERE TO FURNISH AMER ICAN INDUSTRIES WITH SUCH CAPITAL GOODS CAPITAL SUBSIDES TO A GREAT EX TENT OR UNLESS CAPITAL ACCUMULATIONS ARE GREATLY INCREASED WITH EUROPE STILL BIDDING FOR CAPITAL INTEREST RATES ARE NOT LIKELY TO TAKE A MARKED AND IMMEDIATE DOWNWARD TREND PRIOR TO THE WAR THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF NEW SECURITIES ISSUED RECORDED AND UNRE CORDED IS ESTIMATED AT THREE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR DURING AND SINCE THE WAR IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THESE ISSUES HAVE AVERAGED SIX BILLIONS AND YET APPARENTLY THEY HAVE NOT BEEN SUFFI CIENT TO MEET CAPITAL DEMANDS AT A LOW RATE OF INTEREST WITH A LOWER AND LOWERING PRICE LEVEL DOMESTIC CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS SHOULD DIMINISH BUT THERE WILL ALSO BE A DIMINUTION IN CAPITAL ACCUMULATIONS MEASURED IN TERMS OF DOLLARS THE PROBABLE TREND OF INTEREST RATES SO CLOSELY RELATED TO THE EXPORT OF AMERICAN CAPITAL RAISES THE QUESTION OF THE CAPACITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO SAVE SAVINGS NOT INDEFINITELY ELASTIC IF THE SAVINGS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE INDEFINITELY ELASTIC THERE WOULD BE NO PROBLEM CONNECTED WITH THE EXPORT OF AMERICAN CAPITAL THERE WOULD BE NO PARTICULAR PROBLEM OF INTEREST RATES THE HARD FACT HOW EVER IS THAT SAVINGS ARE NOT INDEFINITELY EXPANSIBLE THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL ACCUMULATED DEPENDS ON THE NATIONAL INCOME AND THE CAPACITY AND DISPOSI TION OF THE PEOPLE TO SAVE ANY NATIONS INCOME HAS LIMITS FOR 1917 THE BEST ESTIMATES FIXED THE TOTAL INCOME OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AT FIFTY TO SIXTYFIVE BILLION DOLLARS AS SUMING TWENTY MILLION FAMILIES AT THAT TIME AND A BARE SUBSISTENCE COST OF LIVING FOR EACH AT A THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS WERE NEEDED FOR WHAT MAY BE CALLED A HUMAN MAINTENANCE FUND THIS FUND IS CERTAINLY NOT LESS TODAY OUT OF THE REMAINDER OF WHATEVER THE NATIONAL 7 CAPITALTHE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OR PERHAPS THE QUESTION SHOULD BE PUT THUS TO WHAT EXTENT SHALL AMERICAN SAVINGS BE USED TO FURNISH EUROPE WITH CAPITAL GOODS AND TO WHAT EXTENT USED TO FURNISH CAPITAL GOODS FOR THE REHABIL ITATION OF AMERICAN INDUSTRIES ONE THING AT LEAST SEEMS CLEAR THE UNITED STATES CANNOT EXPORT ITS CAPITAL AND HAVE IT TOO THE EVIDENT PURPOSE OF THE PROPO NENTS OF THE VARIOUS PLANS FOR FINANCING EUROPE IS TO SELL AMERICAN GOODS HENCE THE SUGGESTION THAT CAPITAL ADVANCES BE CONDITIONED ON THE EX PENDITURE OF THE FUNDS IN AMERICAN MARKETS THUS ANY REAL OR SUPPOSED SURPLUS OF GOODS CAN BE REDUCED OR DIS POSED OFAT A PRICE THIS PLAN WAS FOLLOWED DURING THE WAR WITH THE RESULT THAT THERE HAS BEEN AN ACCUMULATION OF EUROPES OBLIGATIONS IN THIS COUNTRY ON WHICH INTEREST CHARGES MAY BE PAID BUT THERE IS NO GENERAL AND CONFIDENT EXPECTATION OF THE PROMPT REPAYMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL THE POINT MUST NOT BE LOST SIGHT OF THAT IF PAYMENT IS MADE IT WILL BE MADE CHIEFLY IN GOODS EUROPES PURPOSE IN SEEKING AMERICAN CAPITAL IS PROBABLY TO BUY NOT MANU FACTURED PRODUCTS BEYOND IMMEDIATE NEEDS BUT RATHER RAW MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT WITH THESE HER LABOR CAN PRODUCE FINISHED PRODUCTS TO BE SOLD BACK TO THE UNITED STATES OR TO OTHER COUNTRIES PERHAPS IN COMPETITION WITH AMERICA THE SCHEME OF FINANCING SALES TO EUROPE WOULD BE MORE ALLURING IF A REVIVAL OF BUSINESS ON THE HIGH PRICE LEVEL OF THE FIRST PART OF 1990 COULD BE FORESEEN BUT THE MAINTENANCE OF SUCH A PRICE LEVEL IS NEITHER POSSIBLE NOR DESIRABLE IT HAS ALREADY BEEN LOWERED EVERYWHERE THE REVIVAL OF AMERICAN BUSINESS ON THE BASIS OF LOWER PRICES IS INEVITABLE IF THE PRICE OF GOODS IS TO BE LOWER COSTS MUST BE LOWERED ENOUGH TO GIVE A REASONABLE MARGIN OF PROFIT THIS APPLIES NOT ONLY TO PRODUCTION FOR THE DOMESTIC MARKET BUT PRODUCTION FOR FOREIGN MARKETS THE LOWERING OF COSTS DE MANDS A HIGHER DEGREE OF EFFICIENCY IN PRODUCTION THIS HIGHER EFFICIENCY MUST BE FOUND IN CAPITAL AS WELL AS LABOR THERE MUST BE THE USE OF ADE QUATE AND EFFICIENT CAPITAL EQUIPMENT AMERICAN TRANSPORTATION IN PARTICULAR HAS CAPITAL NEEDS THAT MUST BE MET IT IS IMPORTANT THEREFORE IN FACT OF MAJOR IMPORTANCE THAT THE QUESTION OF BUSINESS REVIVAL BE CONSIDERED IN RELA TION TO THE PROBLEM OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH AMERICAN CAPITAL SHOULD BE EXPORTED THE REVIVAL OF AMERICAN BUSINESS THE MAIN THREAD OF THE ARGUMENT IN THIS PAPER IS THAT THE REVIVAL OF AMER ICAN BUSINESS WILL BE WORKED OUT ON THE BASIS OF THE DOMESTIC MARKET AND A MORE NORMAL FOREIGN TRADE IN TURNING ATTENTION TO DOMESTIC TRADE THE QUES TION OF CAPITAL NEEDS AT HOME MUST RECEIVE ATTENTION IN CONSIDERING AMERICAN EXPORT TRADE DUE REGARD MUST BE HAD NOT ONLY FOR SCHEMES FOR FINANCING THAT TRADE BUT ALSO FOR THE DOCTRINE OF COMPARATIVE COSTS FULL THOUGHT MUST LIKEWISE BE GIVEN TO THE CORRECTION OF MONETARY CONDITIONS IN EUROPE THROUGH DEFLATION TAXATION AND ECONOMY THE FACT MUST NOT BE OVER LOOKED THAT EUROPEANS MUST RESTRICT IMPORTS IF EUROPEAN NATIONS ARE TO DEFLATE THEIR CURRENCIES PAY TAXES AND WORK THEY WILL HAVE LESS DEMAND FOR ANYTHING FROM THE UNITED STATES OTHER THAN WHAT AIDS THEM TO MANUFACTURE GOODS AND SELL THEM CHIEFLY IN THE AMERICAN MARKET IF CERTAIN OF THE EUROPEAN NATIONS ARE IMPOVERISHED THEIR POSITION WILL NOT BE GREATLY IM PROVED BY AMERICAS FINANCING SALES OF GOODS WITHOUT ADEQUATE CONSIDERA TION OF THE RISK INVOLVED OR THOUGHT OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH CAPITAL SHOULD BE EXPORTED IF EUROPE IS IMPOVERISHEDAMERICAN TRENDS IN FOREIGN TRADE IMPROVEMENT OF THE CONDITION OF HER PEOPLES WILL NOT BE BROUGHT ABOUT BY FORCING AMERICA TO THE SAME CON DITION FOREIGN TRADE HAS BEEN EMPHASIZED TO SUCH A DEGREE OF LATE THAT THOUGHT OF BUSINESS REVIVAL IS LARGELY IN TERMS OF EXPORTS AND FOREIGN FINANCING IF IT WERE NECESSARY FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES TO AWAIT THE REHABILITA TION OF EUROPE BEFORE THEY COULD ENJOY A FULLER MEASURE OF PROSPERITY THEY MIGHT HAVE TO WAIT A VERY LONG TIME JUST HOW LONG NO ONE KNOWS SUCH A PROSPECT IS FAR FROM COMFORTING AT A TIME WHEN GLOOM ENOUGH ENGULFS AMERICAN BUSINESS IT WAS IN THE HOPE THAT A SHIFT OF EMPHASIS FROM FOREIGN TO DOMESTIC TRADE WOULD CARRY A MESSAGE OF ENCOURAGEMENT THAT THIS PAPER WAS PREPARED AN AMERICAN PERSPECTIVE SHOWS THAT MEASURES AT HOME CAN AND SHOULD BE TAKEN THERE NEED BE NO PARALYSIS OF ACTION WITH THE WORLDS GREATEST DOMESTIC MARKET AT HAND AND CONTROLLABLE TO EMPHASIZE THIS POINT AN EXAGGERATED STATEMENT MIGHT ALMOST BE RISKED THAT IF WE TAKE CARE OF OUR NINETYTWO OR NINETYTHREE PER CENT OF DOMESTIC BUSINESS THE SEVEN PER CENT OF FOREIGN BUSINESS WILL TAKE CARE OF ITSELF THIS IS CALCULATED TO BE A MESSAGE OF COMFORT AND CHEER TO ALL WHO HAVE NOT LOST THE POWER OF SELFHELP WHAT IS NEEDED IS COURAGE STRAIGHT THINKING THE RESTORATION OF A SOUND MORAL CODE BUT ABOVE ALL ACTION AMERICAN TRENDS IN FOREIGN TRADE BY F E ST AUSTELL CONTINENTAL AND COMMERCIAL NATIONAL BANK CHICAGO THE UNITED STATES IS FACING EX TRAORDINARY CONDITIONS WITH RE SPECT TO FOREIGN TRADE AND FINANCE BUT BENEATH THESE EXTRAORDINARY CONDI TIONS MAY BE SEEN INDICATIONS OF THE WORKING OF NATURAL TENDENCIES FOR EIGN TRADE CANNOT INDEFINITELY REMAIN ABNORMAL WHEN A MOVEMENT TO CAPTURE FOREIGN MARKETS WAS STARTED THERE WERE A FEW MALIGNED AUTHORITIES WHO ADVISED CAUTION A POLICY OF CAREFUL PROGRESS RATHER THAN HASTY PLUNGING INTO THE INTRICACIES OF FOREIGN TRADE BY THOSE WHO WERE NOT SUFFICIENTLY EQUIPPED WITH PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE CONDUCT OF THAT TRADE BRITISH AND EUROPEAN PAPERS DID NOT SCOFF AT AMERICAN EFFORTS TO CAPTURE MARKETS MANY OF THEM HOWEVER DID POINT OUT THAT THE UNITED STATES WOULD SHOW WISDOM IN ADHERING TO THE DEVELOP MENT OF FOREIGN COMMERCE ALONG LINES WITH WHICH IT WAS FAMILIAR THE HIS TORY OF ENGLANDS OVERSEAS COMMERCE PROVES THAT FOREIGN TRADE IS OF SLOW AND TEDIOUS GROWTH NOT SPRINGING OVER NIGHT INTO FULL BLOOM AS MANY AMERI CAN MERCHANTS AND MANUFACTURERS APPARENTLY EXPECTED THE FOREIGN TRADE OF THE UNITED STATES DURING THE YEARS OF THE WAR AND IN FACT UNTIL THE LATTER PART OF 1919 WAS NOT DEPENDENT ON REAL TRADING OR SALESMANSHIP GOODS WERE ASKED FOR AND SUPPLIED THE MAIN OBJECT BEING THE SATISFACTION OF DEMANDS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SUCH TRADING IS NOT NORTNAL INDIRECT OR TRIANGULAR TRADING IF IT COMES AT ALL IS LIKELY TO BE OF LONG AND SLOW DEVELOPMENT THE TREND OF FOR EIGN TRADE OF THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN DIRECT ENGLISH SHIPPING HAS A LARGE PROPORTION DEVOTED TO TRAMP TRADING A PROPORTION ESTIMATED AT MORE THAN FIFTY PER CENT OF ITS MERCAN 9

offerings to Professor Pelli grino Strobel at Parma HENRY W HAYNES Boston Feb 1 The moons atmosphere I would be glad if James Freeman Clarke would explain the projection of a planet on the moons face by the refraction of an atmosphere as implied in his letter to Science of Jan 8 Would not the rays from the planet pass through the atmosphere in a curve and reach the eye of the observer in a tangent to that curve at the point where it leaves the atmos phere  If so then as this tangent would lie without the moons disk the planet could not by refraction appear projected upon it W G BLISH Niles Mich Jan 21 After reading the question by Mr Blish in regard to the phenomenon described by me viz of the pro jection of the disk of Jupiter on the face of the moon at the moment of occultation I addressed notes to Prof Edward C Pickering of Harvard observatory and Prof B A Gould asking for their opinions in the matter Both have kindly answered me and I transmit a portion of their letters for publication It will be seen that they agree in the main with Mr Blish that refraction by a lunar atmosphere can hardly explain the phenomenon JAMES FREEMAN CLARKE Jamaica Plain 3Mass Feb 1 From Professor Pickering A homogeneous and quiet lunar atmosphere would pretty certainly not account for the apparent projection of a star or planet on the disk of the moon although a disturbance in the atmosphere either of the moon or of the earth might momenta rily confuse the images viewed through it I should prefer explaining the phenomenon by the physiologi cal effect of irradiation which increases the apparent size of bright objects and so might make two disks seem to overlap each other when they were merely tangent From Professor Gould The phenomenon which you observed is I am inclined to believe by no means an uncommon one although as is natural the published accounts of it relate chiefly to bright fixed stars rather than to planets I fear that refraction by a hypothetical atmos phere would not explain the phenomenon adequately although it seems to me that Mr Blish has overstated his case and that the ray emerging from the atmos phere would not necessarily be tangent to the curve at the point of emergence Turning to Herschels  Outlines of astronomy a convenient though not altogether trustworthy book  I find the same phe nomenon mentioned in a footnote to art 414 He speaks of it as an  optical illusion which perhaps it is but calling it by that name does not explain it I myself have seen it and believe that it has been noted by most observers of occultations and I have seen attempts to explain it by  irradiation  and by indentations in the moons limb but I have never seen any explanation which has appeared to me satisfactory It belongs to the same class of phe nomena as the black ligament seen when an in ferior planet transits the solar disk This has never VOL VII No 157 to my knowledge been satisfactorily explained either Festoon clouds of a tornado The clouds so termed by your recent correspondent were more strikingly exhibited than I remember ever to have seen them on the 17th of June 1882 They formed the under surface of the high advanced sheet overhanging the memorable tornado that destroyed Iowa college and onethird of the town of Grinnell Other terms referred to by your correspondent more properly describe the appearance such as sandbags droplets mammillary cloud or they might be spoken of as innumerable filled pockets hanging from the under surface of the sheet It was first seen by me in the western sky at 7 PM after a bright sultry day Near 8 PM the whole west was filled with heavy clouds transfused with gold A fierce thunder storm followed and passed by Immediately after this there was a dead calm for a brief time and then at 845 PM the sudden destructive funnel cloud It was a local storm traced a hundred miles more or less Since then I have watched every threatening sky and have noticed the same phenomenon less strik ingly shown in at least a dozen instances alike in local or limited thunder gusts widely extended storms and in rainless skies overspread by wild looking clouds A splendid exhibition of the last mentioned was seen at sunset last summer The whole sky was overcast by gilded cloud showing the  sandbag feature but in larger bags either abso lutely so or because drifting at a medium cloud height and overhead No evidence of rain nor any unusual surface winds preceded attended or followed on this occasion H W P Grinnell Io Deathrates among college graduates The recent death of Charles W Sanborn of New Hampshire is the occasion for calling attention to a remarkable fact His death is the first that has occurred in the Dart mouth college class of 1872 Sixtynine men gradu ated and for thirteen and one half years their num ber has continued unbroken by death The Chandler scientific class of the same year early lost one man from eleven who graduated The deaths in the two preceding and nine succeed ing classes to 1872 are recorded as follows Class No graduated Deaths since graduation 1870 50 11 1871 68 9 1873 71 4 1874 63 5 1875 48 1 1876 69 4 1877 54 2 1878 74 3 1879 46 3 1880

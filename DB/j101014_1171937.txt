MORROW New York City M OST of the discussion of labor legislation is from the point of view of the laborer I propose to talk about it for a few minutes from the point of view of the em ployer In this as in most other things what helps the laborer probably also helps the employer and what helps the employer probably also helps the laborer The theory of the workmens compensation legislation is to abolish the employers commonlaw liability for negligence and to substitute therefore a definite payment irrespective of negli gence which shall reach the workman or his dependents quickly and with small expense I believe the most enlightened managers of corporations are heartily in sympathy with the change from the employers lia bility theory to the workmens compensation theory In fact a great many of them are working under the workmens com pensation theory today In the case of large corporations with a great many employes it is surprising to find how rarely they consult their counsel with reference to their legal liability in cases of accident They are not so much interested in the theoretical question as to where the legal liability rests as they are in the question whether or not they can get a fair settlement without the great waste of time and money which litigation in volves This is partly from a desire to maintain cordial rela tions with their workmen and it is partly a business proposition A policy of fair settlement is cheaper than one of litigation Let us assume that 15  of the accidents which occur in the business of a large manufacturing corporation are attributable to the negligence of the employer At first blush it may seem I Read at the joint meeting of the Academy of Political Science and the New York Association for Labor Legislation November Io I9II 132WORKMENS COMPENSATION LEGISLATION that a change in the law which will make the employer liable for IOO  instead of for 15  of the accidents will place upon the industry an intolerable burden There are however two important offsetting considerations In the first place if the maximum amount which the employer is required to pay under the new system is smaller than the average amount which he is now required to pay in those cases in which he is legally liable obviously he will be able to distribute the gross amount of his present payments over a wider number of people In the second place no intelligent employer could conduct a business under the old law under the assumption that he is put to no expense for the 85 o of the accidents for which he is not legally liable Every manager of a large corporation realizes that whether or not he is technically liable for an accident every accident costs him something Most large corporations aim therefore to settle every case promptly irrespective of their legal responsibility There are now in the United States I believe about ten workmens compensation acts We are also about to have a federal law applying to interstate carriers These laws differ widely They range all the way from a simple adoption of the workmens compensation principle to elaborate schemes for state insurance I should like to speak briefly about the prin cipal features of four laws those of New Jersey New Hamp shire Massachusetts and Washington I take these four laws because they represent a gradation away from the common law The New Jersey act simply substitutes for the employers commonlaw liability for negligence a liability in all cases except where the injury or death of the workman is intentionally selfinflicted or is caused by intoxication The maximum pay ment in case of death is three thousand dollars spread over three hundred weeks and in case of total disability four thousand dollars spread over four hundred weeks Specific payments are required to be made for specific injuries There is nothing to compel the employer to insure To protect the workman however the right to compensation is given a preferred lien on the assets of the employer This act applies to every employer in the state The act is optional but the state makes an effort to compel employers to adopt the new law by abolishing certain I3382 BUSINESS AND THE PUBLIC WELFARE VOL II commonlaw defenses Several of the largest manufacturing corporations in the state have voluntarily come under the law I understand that those who have accepted the act estimate that it will add to their accident expense This additional payment they are glad to make in the belief that substantially all of their disbursement will go to their workmen instead of a substantial portion being lost in transmission The New Jersey act has been criticized as being unfair to the small employer of labor expecially to the householder Such an employer if he comes under the new law is unable to insure himself He must insure in a casualty company and the casualty rates have been made surprisingly high when examined in view of the data of those large corporations who insure themselves Some relief may possibly be expected when the casualty companies get accurate data as to the cost of the new law The act of New Hampshire like the New Jersey law is op tional It however applies only to selected employments in which the hazard is believed to be great There is no require ment to insure but the employer who accepts the act must sat isfy the commissioner of labor of his financial ability or must file a bond to discharge any liability incurred under the act The Massachusetts law is also optional but any employer de siring to come under the act is required to insure in a state em ployers insurance association The governing body of this association is in the first instance appointed by the state but is later to be chosen by the subscribers to the fund The fixed rates of compensation which the act provides are paid out of the fund The maximum payment is three thousand dollars spread over three hundred weeks in case of death and spread over five hundred weeks in case of total disability The law provides however that if an employer prefers he may insure in any liability insurance company authorized to do business in the state The law passed by the state of Washington and recently held constitutional by the supreme court of that state is a compulsory law applicable only to certain industries defined as hazardous Under the law employers in the industries covered by the act pay into a state insurance fund the premiums fixed by the law and out of this fund a fixed compensation is paid to injured 134No 2 WORKMENS COMPENSATION LEGISLATION workmen It will be seen at once that this is a much further break from the old system than the Massachusetts law Under the Massachusetts law the employer is required to insure if he would get the benefit of the new act but he insures in a mutual company or private company that he himself selects In Wash ington however he must insure with the state An industrial insurance commission is created to administer the law This commission has its main office at the state capital with power to establish branch offices It has power to appoint assistants in cluding a traveling auditor to whom the books records and pay rolls of the employers shall at all times be open It may also employ one or more physicians in each county of the state Whether Washington can find the men to run this complicated machinery may fairly be considered open to doubt I was rather disappointed to hear Mr Dawson say in his very able address that the governor of New Jerseyor as Mr Daw son puts it the most prominent candidate for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States was already dissatisfied with the New Jersey law and was in favor of a law that goes the whole length of the Washington law I am in clined to doubt whether Governor Wilson has gone this far I have read his criticism of the high charges of the insurance companies and I think that this criticism is in a measure just The fact that the New Jersey law applies to everybody in the statenot only to hazardous industries but to every house holderhas made it an unpopular law and it is the people who have had to pay very high insurance rates who are objecting I was also interested to hear Mr Dawson say that the gov ernor of Washington and the governor of Massachusetts who attended the recent conference of governors had not expressed at that conference any dissatisfaction with their laws Perhaps it may have have had some bearing upon their attitude toward their own laws that neither of those laws had gone into effect at the time the conference of governors took place The Wash ington law went into effect October ISt and the Massachusetts law does not go into effect until January 1st next The New Jersey law however had already been in effect at the time of the governors conference though only for a period of about I35 8384 BUSINESS AND THE PUBLIC WELFARE VOL II two months All of us can remember other laws that reached their greatest popularity before they were put into operation It was a sound statement of Mr Shermans in his address that we must not object to these laws merely because we find faults in them You will find faults in any one of the nine or ten workingmens compensation laws that have already been passed in this countryvery serious faults because we are all experimenting with this question I shall read with great interest the full paper of Mr Dawsons in which he suggests a plan by which this question will be dealt with nationally I shall read this paper carefully because of Mr Dawsons wide experience and wellknown and deep interest in the whole subject but I shall be sorry if Mr Dawsons plan or any other mans plan is adopted for the whole United States In a year or two we may have twenty or thirty state laws in ad dition to those that have already been passed In addition we shall have the federal law dealing with interstate carriers the preliminary outline of which was presented by Senator Suther lands committee the other day I prefer to see the people of the United States working with this problem in thirty or forty laboratories instead of in one What we all want is to find a practical method of doing away with the frightful waste of our present accident system We are interested in state accident insurance projects only in so far as they are necessary to help solve the problem To accomplish the desired result we may be driven to state insurance I believe however that those laws have the best chances of success which aim to accomplish the purpose with the least change in the habits of the people A law that fits a highly organized manufacturing state like Ger many after twentyfive years of experience may be very ill suited to a western agricultural state There is one more point that I should like to emphasize in closing Our goal should be the saving of the life the leg or the arm and not the payment for them after they are gone Our laws should be framed if possible to lead to the preven tion of accidents In this connection we may perhaps learn something from the German statistics however doubtful may be their applicability to a country like ours As you all know 136No 2 WORKMENS COMPENSA TION LEGISLATION it is now about twentyfive years since Germany adopted the general principle of workingmens compensation Each ten years the imperial insurance office makes a report classifying the industrial accidents compensated under the new system In a recent bulletin published by the United States Bureau of Labor the German reports for I897 and I907 are compared These figures show that there has been a great increase in the percentage of accidents during the decade The following figures show the sources of accidents in two years a decade apart x897 1907 Due to fault of the employer   1681  1206 Due to fault of workmen  2989 4I26 Due to fault of both employer and workmen   466 91 Due to fault of fellowworkmen or third party 528 594 Due to general hazard of the industry   4205 3765 Other causes    13 2 I8 It will be noted that in the decade the accidents due to the fault of the employer decreased from I6817 to 12066 In the same period the accidents due to the general hazard of the industry decreased from 4205 to 3765 This would indi cate that the law was operating to make employers more care ful On the other hand the accidents due to the fault of the workmen increased from 2989 to 4126 In classifying the time when the accidents occurred it appeared that a larger percentage of accidents fall on Monday than on any other day of the week and that of those that occur on Monday a larger percentage come in the morning than in the afternoon hours The editors of the report suggest that this may be partly caused by the use of alcohol on Sunday and the fatigue following The great increase in the percentage of accidents under the German system and the increase in the percentage attributable to the workmens fault raises a serious problem Many people believe that the rate of accident is bound to continue to increase with the increased use of machinery We may be compelled to accept this conclusion but we should do so reluctantly Meanwhile the American states that have already passed work mens compensation laws are in a fair way to make a contribu I3786 BUSINESS AND THE PUBLIC WELFARE tion to this subject which Germany has not been able to make We all recognize that mere negligence on the part of the em ploye should not bar him from recovery if the workmens com pensation theory is adopted A great number of those acci dents which are attributable to the negligence of the workman are undoubtedly cases in which a certain amount of relaxation or inattention is to be expected from any ordinary human being There are cases however where the workman is not merely negligent but commits an affirmative act of misconduct such as wilfully declining to use a particular safety device For example take the case of the workman washing windows in a tall building who declines to use the safety strap How shall such accidents be treated Under the New Jersey law the workman receives his compensation unless the injury is self inflicted or the workman was intoxicated and under the Ohio law the compensation applies except where the injury was per sonally selfinflicted In California Massachusetts New Hamp shire and Wisconsin however the workman is disentitled if guilty of serious or wilful misconduct The vital distinction between these two classes of laws will be noted at once The states last referred to are trying to put an inducement upon the workman to refrain from misconduct It is to be said against such a course that it may do away with one of the main advan tages of the new system by making each accident still the subject of dispute and litigation It is to be said in favor of such a course however that it may have the desirable effect of keeping down the accident rate It is in the working out of the details of these laws that we should see the great advantage of our form of government With so many states each dealing with its own local affairs but each watching the other and all watching the operation of a federal law applicable to interstate carriers it may well be that we can do something for ourselves and for the world that Ger many has not been able to do That is what I mean when I say that we shall soon be working in thirty or forty laboratories Is it too much to hope that the work will be done in the spirit of the laboratory worker in the spirit of the scholar and with the scholars patience 138

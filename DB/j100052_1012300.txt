J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1012300,THE POSSIBILITY OF COMPETITION IN COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY,I242627,THE POSSIBILITY OF COMPETITION IN COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY BY JOHN BATES CLARK LLD PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL ECONOMY COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY NEW YORK OUR INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM HAS BECOME WHAT IT IS AS A RESULT OF COM PETITION AND OUR ENTIRE POLICY IN DEALING WITH IT DEPENDS ON THE QUESTION WHETHER COMPETITION WILL OR WILL NOT CONTINUE IF IT DOES NOT CONTINUE THE SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC WILL DEPEND ON A REGULATION OF PRICES BY OFFICIALS OF THE STATE THE OBJECTIONS TO THIS MEASURE ARE LITTLE APPRECIATED THE COMPLEXITY AND DIFFICULTY OF THE WORK OF FIXING PRICES BY AUTHORITY AND THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE RESULTS ARE SELFEVIDENT NOT QUITE SO SELFEVIDENT ARE THE CHECKS WHICH THE POLICY WOULD PUT ON TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENT AND THE PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE OF SUCH IMPROVEMENT PRICES AS FIXED BY A COMMISSION WOULD DOUBTLESS BE BASED IN THE MAIN ON THE COST OF PRODUCTION AND A REASONABLE RETURN FOR THE PRODUCER ON SUCH A BASIS A GREAT TRUST MIGHT BE ABLE TO MAKE AS MUCH WITH ANTIQUATED APPLIANCES AS WITH MODER ONES AND IT WOULD NATURALLY REBEL AGAINST THE NECES SITY OF SACRIFICING CAPITAL BY THROWING AWAY THE MACHINERY IT HAS SO TO SPEAK IT WOULD MAKE NO ADEQUATE USE OF A JUNK HEAP AND INVENTION WOULD STAGNATETHAN WHICH IF IT BECAME A GENERAL CONDI TION NO GREATER EVIL OF AN ECONOMIC SORT IS CONCEIVABLE ON THE OTHER HAND IF COMPETITION SHOULD CONTINUE ANOTHER MEASURE WOULD COME INTO VIEW AS A POSSIBILITY AND IT NEEDS TO BE EXAMINED IN ADVANCE IT IS A CERTAIN RESTRICTION OF THE SIZE OF COR PORATIONS IF THEY WERE LARGE ENOUGH TO DO ALL THE BUSINESS IN THEIR SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS AND WERE ACTUALLY DOING IT OF COURSE COMPE TITION OF AN ACTIVE SORT WOULD BE EXTINCT BUT COMPETITION OF A POTENTIAL KIND MIGHT THEORETICALLY REMAIN IT IS ALL IMPORTANT TO DETERMINE WHETHER THIS CONDITION IS OR IS NOT A SATISFACTORY ONE POTENTIAL COMPETITION IS A REGULATOR OF PRICES AND IS THE PRODUCT OF NATURAL LAW RATHER THAN LEGISLATION IT ONCE GAVE PROMISE OF BEING IN ITSELF POWERFUL ENOUGH TO KEEP PRICES WITHIN A SHORT DISTANCE OF THEIR PROPER LEVEL IN THE EIGHTIES A NUMBER OF THE GREAT TRUSTS UNDERWENT REORGANIZATION IN CONSEQUENCE OF DISREGARDING THIS IN 63THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY FLUENCE THEY RAISED PRICES TOO HIGH AND THE POTENTIAL COMPETITOR WHO MIGHT HAVE REMAINED AS A LATENT FORCE PROMPTLY MATERIALIZED AS AN ACTIVE COMPETITOR AND BROKE THE PRICES DOWN IT WAS AN OBJECT LESSON INSPIRING A SALUTARY RESPECT FOR THE POWER OF COMPETITION AND SOME OF THAT RESPECT REMAINS THOUGH NOT ALL THE LIMIT ON PRICES WHICH MERELY POTENTIAL COMPETITION NOW FURNISHES IS NOT A CLOSE ONE AND THE REASON FOR THIS IS THE POWER OF THE GREAT PRODUCER TO SLUG THE SMALL ONE WHEN HE ACTUALLY APPEARS IN THE FIELD BY PREFERENTIAL RATES OF TRANSPORTATION BY LOCAL DIS CRIMINATION IN THE PRICES OF GOODS BY THE FACTORS AGREEMENT AND BY OTHER MEASURES THE GREAT PRODUCER HAS MAINTAINED HIS MONOPOLY BY DRIVING HIS RIVAL FROM THE FIELD AND HAS DONE IT BY UNFAIR PLAY WHICH CAN BE RULED OUT BY LAW IT IS AS IF IN A GAME OF CHESS A BULLY COULD ARBITRARILY PICK OFF HIS OPPONENTS QUEEN AND DEFY HIM TO RESTORE IT OR AS IF IN A GAME OF WHIST HE COULD APPROPRIATE TRUMPS OR ACES AD LIBERTUM IT IS AS IF IN A FOOTBALL GAME HE COULD FOULLY DISABLE HIS OPPONENT IN DEFIANCE OF UMPIRES IN THE ECONOMIC FIELD MERE SIZE DOES NOT IN ITSELF GUARANTEE SUCCESS IN THE CONTEST OF SURVIVAL THE VICTORY GOES UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS TO ESSENTIAL EXCELLENCE AND THAT TRAIT MAY BE POSSESSED BY THE SMALLER COMPANY RATHER THAN BY THE GREAT ONE EXCELLENCE AS A PUBLIC SERVANT NORMALLY ENABLES ANY PRODUCER TO THRIVE AND GROW AND IF THIS IS MADE TO BE THE ACTUAL TEST AS WELL AS THE NATURAL AND RIGHT ONE THE ENTIRE QUESTION OF THE CONTINUANCE OF COMPETITION WILL BE TRANSLATED TO A HIGHER PLANE THE EXCELLENT SERVANT WITH A SMALL CAPITAL WILL HAVE AN INDEFINITELY BETTER CHANCE THAN HE NOW HAS FOR SURVIVAL AND UNTIL THIS CONDITION IS CREATED IT IS UNINTELLIGENT TO DRAW THE CONCLUSION THAT COMPETITION IS MORIBUND THIS MEANS THAT WE CANNOT KNOW WHETHER EFFECTIVE COMPETITION WILL SURVIVE OR NOT TILL WE HAVE TAKEN MEASURES TO PREVENT IT FROM BEING KILLED BY FOUL BLOWS SOME OF THOSE MEASURES HAVE LONG BEEN WELL KNOWN AS A MAT TER OF THEORY AND SOME EFFORT HAS BEEN MADE TO PUT THEM INTO PRAC TICE THERE IS LESS FAVORITISM IN TRANSPORTATION THAN THERE ONCE WAS LOCAL PRICE DISCRIMINATIONS AND THE FACTORS AGREEMENT ARE THINGS WHICH CAN BE REPRESSED THE MONOPOLIZING OF RAW MATERIALS CAN BE PREVENTED AND IN A GENERAL WAY A CONDITION CAN BE CREATED IN WHICH ANY PRODUCER CAN THRIVE IF ONLY HE RENDERS TO SOCIETY A SERVICE WHICH ENTITLES HIM TO DO SO WHEN THAT HAS BEEN DONE 64THE POSSIBILITY OF COMPETITION IN COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY 65 IT WILL BE TIME TO PRONOUNCE A FINAL JUDGMENT ON THE FUTURE OF COM PETITION BEFORE IT HAS BEEN DONE IT WOULD BE AN ABSURDITY TO DO SO POTENTIAL COMPETITION IS NOW BY NO MEANS EXTINCT IN THE CASE OF EVERY TRUST HOWEVER POWERFUL IT HAS SOME INFLUENCE ON PRICES BUT ITS INFLUENCE IS NOT WHAT IT SHOULD BE IT IS BY NO MEANS WHAT IT WILL BE WHEN THE FOUL BLOWS OF WHICH IT IS NOW IN DANGER SHALL BE RULED OUT IT IS ALL IMPORTANT THAT WE SHOULD HAVE CLEAR EVI DENCE OF ITS EXISTENCE AND ITS EFFICIENCY AND THE ONLY EVIDENCE WHICH IS CONCLUSIVE IS THE PRESENCE OF A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ACTIVE COM PETITION WHERE PRICES ARE HIGH ENOUGH TO AFFORD A HANDSOME PROFIT TO A NEW PRODUCER AND HE ACTUALLY DOES NOT APPEAR THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG IN THE SITUATION THE EVIDENCE THAT HE CAN APPEAR WILL BE FURNISHED IF HE SOMETIMES DOES SO IN INDUSTRIES WHERE TRUSTS ARE EXTREMELY POWERFUL THERE ARE USUALLY SOME INDEPENDENT PRODUCERS IF THEY ARE TOLERATED ONLY BY GRACE OF THE TRUST AND CAN OPERATE ONLY IN SMALL AND SHARPLY DEFINED FIELDS THEY AFFORD NO EVIDENCE THAT COMPETITION IS REALLY FREE THERE MAY BE A POLICY IN LETTING THEM LIVE AS A MEANS OF HOODWINKING THE PUBLIC AND AS THE BASIS OF THE CLAIM BEFORE THE COURTS THAT NO MONOPOLY EXISTS IF THEIR EXISTENCE IS NOT A MATTER OF TOLERANCE BUT OF NECESSITY IF THE TRUST CANNOT CRUSH THEM WITH OUT UNFAIR BLOWS AND IS NOT ALLOWED TO RESORT TO THESE THEN A CERTAIN FREEDOM OF COMPETITION DOES EXIST IT WILL ALWAYS BE FOR THE INTEREST OF A GREAT CORPORATION TO POS SESS ITSELF OF THE WHOLE OF ITS FIELD IF IT CAN DO SO WITHOUT DANGER AS HAS BEEN SAID THE GOVERNMENT CAN MAKE THAT DANGEROUS BUT IT CAN DO MORE THAN THIS NAMELY IT CAN REDUCE THE TEMPTATION TO RESORT TO EVIL PRACTICES BY MAKING IMPOSSIBLE THE GAINS THAT NOW COME BY MEANS OF THEM IT CAN PREVENT A CORPORATION FROM ABSORBING A RIVALS BUSINESS AS THE RESULT OF A SUCCESSFUL WAR UPON HIM WE ARE LIVING UNDER THE SHERMAN LAW AND THERE IS NO PROB ABILITY THAT IT WILL BE ESSENTIALLY CHANGED THERE IS AT PRESENT GOOD REASON WHY IT SHOULD NOT BE IT IS TO BE HOPED AND EXPECTED THAT CORPORATIONS DOING INTERSTATE BUSINESS WILL BE REQUIRED TO ACT EITHER UNDER A FEDERAL LICENSE OR A FEDERAL CHARTER AND THAT AN INDUSTRIAL COMMISSION OF SOME KIND WILL DECIDE WHO SHALL RECEIVE SUCH CHARTERS IN PERFORMING THIS DUTY THE COMMISSION WILL BE THE SUPREME PRO TECTOR OF THE PUBLIC AND IF IT IS ABLE AND FAITHFUL IT WILL NEVER LICENSE A COMPANY WHICH IS IN POSSESSION OF THE WHOLE FIELD OF ITS SPECIALTHE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY INDUSTRY IT WILL IMPOSE ON EVERY CORPORATION A BURDEN OF PROOF FIRST THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE THE WHOLE FIELD SECONDLY THAT RIVALS MAINTAIN THEMSELVES BY THEIR OWN EXCELLENCE AND ARE NOT TOLERATED AS A BLIND FOR THE PUBLIC THIRDLY THAT THERE ARE ENOUGH OF THEM TO AFFECT THE STANDARDS OF PRICE IN THE WHOLE INDUSTRY AND FOURTHLY THAT THE WAY IS SO OPEN FOR THE ENTRANCE OF MORE THAT PRICES CANNOT BECOME EXTORTIONATE IT WILL BE SEEN THAT THIS AMOUNTS TO PUTTING SOME RESTRICTION ON THE SIZE OF CORPORATIONS IF WE CALL IT A DEFINITE REGULATING OF THE AMOUNT OF THEIR CAPITAL WE USE A SOMEWHAT MISLEADING EXPRESSION FOR THE POLICY DOES NOT INVOLVE DETERMINING IN A STATUTORY WAY WHAT FRACTION OF THE TOTAL CAPITAL OF AN INDUSTRY A PARTICULAR COM PANY SHALL CONTROL TO SAY THAT A CORPORATION SHALL NEVER BE ALLOWED TO HAVE MORE THAN FIFTY OR SEVENTYFIVE PER CENT OF THE TOTAL CAPITAL OF THE INDUSTRY WOULD LEAD TO PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES AND THOUGH IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO SURMOUNT THESE IT IS MUCH EASIER TO AVOID THEM IF WE REFUSE FEDERAL CHARTERS OR LICENSES TO CORPORATIONS WHICH CAN NOT SHOW THAT ACTIVE COMPETITION EXISTS AND THAT POTENTIAL COMPETI TION IS FREE AND EFFECTIVE WE ACCOMPLISH THE PURPOSE IN VIEW AND IT IS THEN LESS IMPORTANT WHETHER THE FIELD IS IN THE POSSESSION OF ONE COLOSSAL COMPANY AND MANY SMALLER ONES OR IN THAT OF ONE COMPANY WHICH IS VERY LARGE AND A NUMBER OF OTHERS OF MODERATE SIZE IF THIS WERE THE PLACE TO ARGUE THE QUESTION I WOULD MAIN TAIN THAT UNDER SUCH A SYSTEM TOLERANT COMPETITION AS DISTINCT FROM CUTTHROAT COMPETITION IS PROBABLE THE MOTIVE FOR A FIERCE WAR OF PRICES IS A DESIRE TO ABSORB A RIVALS BUSINESS AND IT WILL BE REMOVED IF THAT ABSORPTION ITSELF IS RENDERED IMPOSSIBLE IT IS AN UNTHINKING JUDGMENT THAT ASSUMES AT ONCE THAT EVEN SUCH A DIVI SION OF A TRUST AS SHOULD MAKE TEN CORPORATIONS OUT OF ONE WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY A WAR OF EXTERMINATION BETWEEN THEM AND THAT THE NECESSITY FOR A FUTURE UNION WOULD SO REVEAL ITSELF WE CAN DIVIDE AN ENORMOUS TRUST INTO TEN FRAGMENTS IF WE WISH TO DO SO AND CAN PROBABLY ESCAPE THE DIREFUL WAR OF PRICES WHICH MANY PERSONS ANTI CIPATE NEVERTHELESS THE VIEW HERE ADVOCATED IS THAT SUCH DRASTIC DIVISIONS ARE PROBABLY UNNECESSARY WHAT MAY BE SAID WITH CER TAINTY IS THAT THE NEED OF THEM HAS NOT BEEN PROVED SHORT OF THAT IT IS IN OUR POWER TO GIVE TO COMPETITION COMPLETE VIGOROUS LIFE AND THUS TO RETAIN IN OUR INDUSTRY THAT PRINCIPLE OF PROGRESS ON WHICH THE VALUE OF THE SYSTEM AND THE HOPES OF ALL THAT LIVE BY MEANS OF IT DEPEND 66

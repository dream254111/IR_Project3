j100358,The School Review,1075383,Secondary Education in the English Popular Schools,i244555,SECONDARY EDUCATION IN THE ENGLISH POPULAR SCHOOLS THERE are many interesting comparisons between English and American schools The two systems show certain similari ties for they have come from the same root and are sensitive in greater or less degree to modern life but they also show some striking contrasts One of the most interesting of these con trasts appears in the provisions of the two systems for anything beyond elementary education School sentiment in England is still very imperfectly devel oped We are not more than half in earnest as to education said a prominent master  half of us believe in it half do not The higher classes do not seem to be united in educational efforts for the masses It is equally manifest that the masses are not fully interested for themselves at least above a crude mini mum of education teachers in all quarters speak of this attitude There are some who think that in the easier circumstances of recent years they are not so rampant in these matters as they were some years ago when industrial conditions were harder There is a strong tendency to withdraw pupils from school as soon as government requirements are satisfied So little breadth of interest is manifested in education that parents in some cases take children from school the moment the given limit is reached without regard to completeness of the work One teacher told me that thirtyone pupils had left a single class during the year and this was in a school possessed of one of the finest build ings that came to my notice and situated in a district whose physical conditions apparently removed it far from the poorest Like some daylaborers when the hour has struck the pupils dropped the scholastic shovel and attended to matters that appealed more to them or to their guardians Again school boards frequently adopt an attitude of indifference or skepti cism or are chary of the rates so that school support lags 361THE SCHOOL REVIEW behind school needs and parallel conditions may probably be found among churchschool managers A phase of this school sentiment is seen also in the attitude toward technical education There is a prejudice in certain quarters on the part of employers and particularly on the part of workmen against the technically educated expert The old apprentice system is better in their eyes The principal of a new technical school in a great industrial centera man who is acquainted with technical education in Europe and the United Statessaid that the apathy and indifference toward such train ing were maddening Not all communities have this same atti tude but it is a condition to be reckoned with In consonance with this lack of interest in education is the impression which one can hardly escape that the view of edu cation is largely utilitarian and this naturally comes out in the aims of the teachers as a sudden question reveals them to the visitor More teachers speak of fitting pupils to fill their places than of developing character and forming for citizenship The idea of education as a force working beyond rather narrow utilitarian ideals seems to find little popular recognition In this whole discussion however it must be remembered that the terms of life in England are harder than here The earnings of children are more generally an important factor in the family income Not only may children be withdrawn early from school but while attending school they are frequently employed during free hours and sometimes at unseasonable hours to add pence and shillings to the home funds As the pressure is greater there than here we see that the slow growth of educa tional sentiment may have at least some excuse This same cir cumstance will account in part for the small amount of home work in connection with the popular schools On the other hand a prominent educator said to me that even where there is no money pressure people are glad to get children away from school The main causes of indifference evidently lie deeper In view of these conditions it is not surprising that popular secondary education has had little development notwithstand ing the strong indorsement which the popularschool idea has 362SECONDARY EDUCATION IN ENGLISH SCHOOLS received in some quarters Still there are not a few opportuni ties for such education It has not been supported by the united sentiment of the country but it has made a good beginning and pupils of popular schools are taking advantage of it  There are two forms of secondary education  I that which may be called private or aristocratic secondary education which has grown out of the old cathedral and monastic schools and traces its lineage back to the earliest times when secondary educa tion was the only formal education given 2 the secondary education which has sprung from simple forms and represents a growth from elementary foundations upwardthe expanding and advancing force in education From the first a large part of the population would be barred by the size of tuition fees To the second pupils are admitted without charge or on the payment of a merely nominal fee The latter is the more recent develop ment in secondary education It is this form with which we are particularly concerned in speaking of the popular schools A few words as to its evolution will be in place here Until very recently popular education in England has been an expression of church activity or of private benevolence As a rule it has been closely associated with the church Early in the last century church schools were systematized somewhat by the formation of two societiesthe National Society of the Established Church and the British Society representing the Dissenters With the help of the monitorial system the source of the present pupilteacher system their schools spread rapidly These societies have been joined by others which have brought in their own series of schools As a result of these movements there are now more than I4000 church or  voluntary  schools in England and Wales most of them connected with the Church of England After 1833 they were supported by voluntary con tributions tuition fees and government grants In I870 owing to the general inadequacy of existing school facilities and in part perhaps to a desire for unsectarian education new schools known as  board schools came into existence and were estab lished in large numbers where school accommodations were lacking There are 5797 of these schools now in operation 363THE SCHOOL REVIEW They are managed by locally elected school boards and are supported by taxes fees and grants These schools therefore correspond more closely to our public schools England has thus had two series of schools and will continue to have them under the new bill though there will be much greater unity in administration These popular schools have had a striking growth and have made marked progress in educational standards but there are still great deficiencies The board schools are by far the stronger of the two series They have had the most favorable condition for growth for they have invited and required more cooperation on the part of the school public So progressive have they been that they have materially affected standards in some of the endowed schools In connection with these elementary schools a typical cur riculum has been developed which it is important to keep in mind as we proceed It is this religious instruction English including reading recitation composition and practical gram mar arithmetic lessons including objectlessons on geogra phy history and common things drawing for boys needle work for girls singing physical training Not all these sub jects however are required either in all classes or in all schools The only really obligatory or standard subjects seem to be read ing writing and arithmetic But all the studies mentioned have the force of the boards recommendation and as a matter of fact are found quite generally in the schools In many cases the curriculum is stronger than the official one But popular education can never be confined within ele mentary grades So vigorous are its lifeforces that it is bound to take on new functions and new meaning English popular education has done this It is significant that the English code not only outlines a typical elementary course but suggests a long list of optional subjects from which the elementary course may draw as conditions warrant Thus elementary schools add differentials to their simple program But aside from this popular education has developed some new school forms which in one degree or another have to do with secondary work and 364SECONDARY EDUCATION IN ENGLISH SCHOOLS have already had such influence that they have excited some jealousy in the old secondary schools which had in a way pre empted secondary ground These special forms we must now consider i The highergrade elementary school or highergrade school as it is calledA few specimen curricula will show much as to the nature of these schools and will furnish an objective basis for description and criticism No i Elementary course plus algebra botany French and advanced art work No 2 Elementary course plus algebra a little additional elementary science a little French and art work No 3 Elementary course plus algebra Euclid French Latin for special calls physics chemistry art work Also a special scholarship class in which trigonometry is added and more advanced work is done in science and art No 4 Elementary course plus algebra French Latin English literature shorthand mensuration No 5 Elementary course plus algebra French geometry No 6 Elementary course plus algebra mensuration Some of these secondary additions seem very meager but it should be said that in the case of 4 5 and 6 the schoolgroup contains also a school of science which offers secondary subjects after standard VI or VII and that most if not all of the schools represented in the list give opportunity for manual work and housewifery It appears then that if to an ordinary elementary curriculum are added certain socalled secondary subjects varying in num ber from two or three to seven or eight the sum may be a higher grade course and is such if local ambition supported by the authority or the board so denominate it The standard is therefore a very indefinite one An elementary school which has added French and algebra and gives special force to the work above the fourth standard making itself perhaps a kind of finishing school may be designated a highergrade school Another school under the same local board doing equally creditable work and offering substantially the same subjects may be called an elementary school only The distinctive See above We might perhaps for our purpose here add drawing as a general subject and some elementary science 365THE SCHOOL REVIEW character of the school appears to be determined by the work above the fourth standard In fact this part of the school is further distinguished sometimes by being organized as a sepa rate school unit while the lower standards are grouped into what is called the junior school Highergrade elementary schools are rather common but it is evident that they have no uniform significance as to secondary education Some of them hardly need be considered in this connection The few that have broader scope and are more definitely organized for their purpose however give pupils a decided taste of secondary work and leave them well on the way to a full secondary course 2 Higher elementary schoolThis is a new term in English school terminology The school so designated is not however a really new one It represents an attempt by the government to make a definite standard for and bring system into the higher grade schools Certain requirements and conditions have therefore been established which must be fulfilled before a school can be accepted as a higher elementary school I Admission is granted only to qualified pupils who are at least ten years old The course thus begins at the fifth standard 2 Pupils are allowed to remain only till the close of the year in which they are fifteen 3 The school must be organized and equipped to give a good fouryear course of study approved by the central school authority The teaching force must conform to special qualifications 4 The number of pupils in a school must not exceed three hundred and the number of pupils to a teacher is limited to forty in the first two years and thirty in the last two 1The English schools are organized in groups I An infant school for children from three to six years old divided into two or three classes according to conditions 2 A school for older children from six to fourteen The sexes are regularly sepa rated particularly in schools for older pupils When these latter schools are again divided into junior and senior departments the school group may consist of six schools each with its own quarters and its own staff of teachers Finally there may be attached to the group several departments for manual work and housewifery and a department for defectives The regular course for older pupils is divided into 7 standards each representing a years work A given standard however must be xeckoned as hardly equivalent to our grade of corresponding number Frequently an exseventh standard is added for the benefit of those who can continue beyond the regular limit Oftener perhaps a school offers nothing beyond the fifth or sixth standard 366SECONDARY EDUCA ION IN ENGLISH SCHOOLS The school is therefore more definitely and carefully organ ized and extends its curriculum one year in time beyond the ordinary elementary program It thus affords a more extensive course of study A curriculum of one of these schools will give some idea of the work offered It includes the basal elementary course and these secondary subjects French algebra Euclid trigonometry theoretical and practical physics and chemistry art and manual work At present very few schools have been recognized as higher elementary schools The BlueBook of 1902 gives the number as ten of which nine are connected with the board schools The number of pupils on the registers for the first years work is 999 for the second 927 for the third 935 and for the fourth 379 The falling off in that year of the course which represents the addition in time to the ordinary elementary course is thus very striking 3 The school of scienceThis school is the creation of the science and art department one of the coordinate departments of the board of education It represents the nearest approach to our public high school A few extracts from the regulations of the department will show something of its aim and scope A school of science must provide a thorough and progressive course of education in science combined with literary or commercial instruction adapted to students whose education is such as would fit them to enter Standard VII of the English Code for a Public Elementary School It does not however follow that a school must admit students thus qual ified One school which I visited required the completion of the seventh standard for admission This department has to do more particularly with secondary education Its work has been generously interpreted to include any secondary subject except Latin and Greek In reality however it has had much to do with elementary education in the line of science and art The department is interested in other schools besides the school of science It is anxious to advance its subjects It may be proper to say here that while it is acknowledged that it has done good service for science there is some complaint that it has made the work fragmentary The various subjects under its patronage are promoted by means of grants As the amount of grantmoney which a school receives depends on the number of subjects taken as well as on the quality of the work there is a temptation to take a minimum amount of several subjects rather than a substan tial amount of one 367THE SCHOOL REVIEW Students whom the Inspector reports to be unfitted to benefit by the course and students under twelve years of age  unless specially allowed by the Inspector must be excluded In a school of science every student upon whom the variable grant is claimed must be presented to the Inspector in the obligatory subjects of science and art in at least one foreign language and in such other subjects of instruction as have been approved in the timetable submitted to the Board Not less than thirteen hours per week must be allotted to instruction in the obligatory science and art subjects Not less than eight hours must be devoted to obligatory subjects other than mathematics Not less than ten hours must be given to the other approved subjects which must include English subjects The attendance and variable grants are not payable for more than two years in the Elementary Course or for more than four years in all on account of any one student The limit of the course is therefore fixed but its length is indefinite The school of science may thus extend its work two three or four years beyond the limit of the elementary school The department outlines a minimum preliminary course in mathematics science and art to which must be added the literary and commercial subjects already referred to It also outlines advanced courses in physical science mechanics and biology from which a selection may be made by individual schools but the line of work chosen for the second advanced year must be a continuation of the work of the first There is thus considerable opportunity for specialization Finally it arranges special courses suited for rural schools Two or three specimen curricula will show the application of these recom mendations to the schools No i Mathematics physics and chemistry theoretical and practical mechanics manual instruction commercial arithmetic drawing with design Frehch bookkeeping shorthand English housewifery dress making No 2 English arithmetic geography history mathematics 2 French drawing inorganic chemistry theoretical and practical mechanics heat magnetism and electricity practical plane and solid geometry manual instruction cookery The studies are given here and in the following lists in the order in which they are named in the prospectus 2Mathematics in this curriculum must be taken as referring to algebra This appears to be a not uncommon interpretation of the term 368SECONDARY EDUCATION IN ENGLISH SCHOOLS No 3 The prospectus of this school gives a program arranged for three years From information as to attendance given me at the school however I think that a fouryear course is now offered First year Scripture practical plane and solid geometry drawing mathematics including commercial arithmetic elementary chemistry and physics theoretical and practical manual instruction dressmaking French or Latin English geography bookkeeping shorthand Second year Scripture practical plane and solid geometry machine drawing mathematics theoretical mechanics advanced magnetism and electricity practical and theoretical advanced chemistry practical and theoretical manual instruction practical dressmaking French or Latin English bookkeeping shorthand Third year Scripture practical plane and solid geometry advanced mathematics mechanics solids and fluids advanced magnetism and electricity theoretical and practical advanced sound light and heat advanced inorganic chemistry theoretical and practical Latin English The present arrangements for science schools date from 1895 but the movement is much older Scores of these schools have been established They are not confined to the board and voluntary series but may be attached to endowed schools which fulfil the conditions They evidently afford a good opportunity for testing the educational persistence of the popular school pupils so that figures as to attendance will be especially interesting here In one of the schools the report was that about 35 per cent of the pupils continue two years o per cent three years and IO per cent four years This school does not receive pupils till they have finished Standard VII so that the third and fourth years represent so much advance in time beyond the elementary course In a second school 50 per cent of the pupils continue two years and a very small percentage perhaps 8 or 10 per cent take a third year In this case as pupils enter the science school from the sixth standard the second and third years correspond to the first and second of the previous school These figures are of course not conclusive but in connection with other statistics they add cumulative evidence as to the point in question 4 The pupilteacher centerThis school as its name indicates has to do particularly with pupilteachers who spend part of their time in observing and assisting in the elementary schools 369THE SCHOOL REVIEW and a part in study It offers a fouryear course which affords training in elementary subjects and also prepares for the Kings scholarship examination or for this in connection with university matriculation2 Because of this latter alternative there must of course be some differentiation in part of the course On passing the Kings scholarship examination which is the only end in view in most cases students are qualified to enter a training college or they may be accepted as assistant or in exceptional cases as provisionally certificated teachers To meet the needs of such students the center must offer considerable secondary work In fact it has many elements of our public highschool course as a specimen curriculum will show Arithmetic algebra to binomials Euclid four books trigonometry to solution of triangles reading recitation composition penmanship Eng lish literature including a university extension  course French and Latin taken by all for two years later pupils specialize according to the end in view geography school management history needlework physiology and hygiene physical geography biology elementary geology theoretical and practical chemistry music general knowledge But pupilteacher centers vary Not all give a program like the one just outlined though that would probably give a fair idea of the course in many schools Here is another curriculum from a center connected with a group of church schools English arithmetic history geography method music Because these centers minister to a special class their rela tions are not as broad as those of others in the list Again they are naturally confined to the larger communities and as the name would indicate are not numerous since each must supply a whole district But however limited their field they claim a place in any enumeration of facilities for secondary education connected with the popular schools 5 The evening continuation schoolAt the beginning of their history evening continuation schools were evidently The proportion varies Sometimes their time is equally divided between the two occupations Oftener however the larger part of the week must be given to school service The government fixes the maximum time for this service at twenty hours per week and many schools live faithfully up to this maximum Sometimes pupilteachers have no responsibility in the schools and are not entrusted with a regular class Often however they are in fact though not in name a regular part of the teaching force 2Universityadmission requirements however are much less severe than with us The contrast is a striking one 37oSECONDARY EDUCATION IN ENGLISH SCHOOLS intended for those who were deficient in elementary education Today however they are to a large extent secondary institu tions and are open to all who are fourteen years of age and over and are not connected with a day school They have had a large growth in the more thickly settled communities and now number more than 5ooo The London school board alone has 395 schools while the Manchester board has more than Ioo They are taught principally by teachers from the elementary day schools who take this means of increasing their moderate stipends By this means they probably secure a better teaching staff than might otherwise be possible but they do it at the expense of the day schools because of divided force and interest A few specimen curricula will show something as to the nature and scope of these schools The first

work both theoretical and practical is offered 2 that the culture idea is far from prominent This latter feature might readily be anticipated from the name and history of the school In fact it is consonant with the general spirit of the popular schools and the general attitude toward education 6 Finally for the sake of completeness mention should be made of various technical schools and courses under the county councils which offer secondary work applied in a special field  Slight differences appear in the curricula of individual schools 2One school offers practically the whole list or its equivalent others offer gen erous selections 372SECONDAR Y EDUCA TION IN ENGLISH SCHOOLS These then are the schools which add to the popular school series certain elements of secondary education The amount of secondary education varies from what we often find in our seventh and eighth grades to a fouryear course of study From this more or less detailed description of the different schools I pass to some general features which are needed to show their nature and relations We have so long associated the idea of popular school and free school that at first one may be inclined to look for a similar association in other systems This association does not hold in England though there is an approximation to it Fees have always played a part in the elementary schools They have now however disappeared in most of the  board schools and they remain in only oneseventh of the  voluntary  schools In the secondary form they may possibly not be found more gen erally but they are higher and though perhaps not more than 6d or 7d per week they suggest a condition to be con sidered But we are concerned with the how as well as with the what in these schoolswith method of teaching as well as with curricula And here one meets one of the most striking charac teristics of English schools The method of teaching is mar velously uniform Briefly outlined the plan is this I oral presentation 2 supplementary readingbooks also a sumbook in arithmetic and algebra and a chartbook in geography 3 reproductions in an exercisebook books are corrected some times there is a conference with the teacher 4 questions on the subject at the next class period 5 work done mostly in school a little home work under favorable home conditions Of course there are variations in proportion and order and even in elements but this is the typical method and in its essential features is found everywhere The oralpresentation method has great possibilities but it may be doubted whether in English schools it is always objec tive and inductive It certainly is not well supported by the supplementary use of books for training pupils in selfreliance and independent work Books are scarce in English schools 3737iHE SCHOOL REVIEW Referencebooks are almost an unknown quantity The pupils therefore depend mostly on the teacher American schools have gone to one extreme in the matter of books which as used have often been a most unpedagogical element in school method English popular schools have gone to the other and it must be confessed less dangerous extreme Inductive work followed by a pedagogical use of books promises the best results in present ing new topics but inductive work is not a fixed quantity it takes various forms according to age and individuality for it adapts itself to all stages of development Now this typical method which has been outlined above overflows into the secondaryschool forms There is this differ ence however that there is more tendency here to use text books Complaint as to the inability of highergrade pupils to manage books emphasizes the deficiencies of the lower schools It is probable too that the method is better employed in these schools because of higher average qualifications on the part of teachers It may be noted also that in science which is so com mon in highergrade curricula the elements of method are those we are familiar with in our schools illustrative talk individual experiment and individual notebook work really textbook making though they do not always come in this order This plan however is generally related to the one previously described The ordinary point of view in education or rather the direc tion in education would seem to be from the subject to the childwhich reverses psychological order Everything in popu lar education tends to make the subject dominant In this con nection reference should be made to the omnipresent examinations for scholarships and exhibitions which while emphasizing quality also emphasize subjects and amounts of subjects and thus complicate method It sometimes seems as though exami nations in English schools were the sum and end of things In the same line is the quest for grants already mentioned Outside of the circle of the highergrade schools which have been described lie the endowed secondary schools both old See p 17 for further reference 374SECONDARY EDUCATION IN ENGLISH SCHOOLS and new for the middle classes Some of these schools would undoubtedly be open to the popularschool pupils for they wish patronage and there is no strict class distinction in them but they require tuition fees of five guineas and upward and further more require time which is equal to money and is a most important factor with the common people All but the most daring among the poorest classes would find these effectual barriers while many of those in more comfortable circumstances already have a sufficient barrier in the general educational sentiment This brings me to the consideration of a final means for securing secondary education It is not a school but it makes school possible for a good many who would not otherwise be attracted I refer to the numerous scholarships and exhibitions or in plain English money prizes which are won by exami nations They help pupils toward some of the education repre sented in some of the six schools described and also to the fuller courses in the endowed schools The process by which these ends are attained may be illustrated as follows A boy in an elementary school wins a scholarship or exhibition which gives him means for going a little highersay to the full course of a highergrade school or a school of science Here he wins another prize which takes him to some endowed secondary school for the middle classes where fees of five guineas or more are required Here he may win a third scholarship taking him to the university It may be of interest here to give a brief description of an endowed school which comes near to the common people and hence might attract popularschool pupils whom ambition or scholarship or both urge on to higher attainments and higher In recent years various old endowments whose objects had become obsolete and perhaps others which had been diverted from their main object have been reorganized and put to work in more fruitful lines One old endowment which came to my notice had originally been established for the purpose of buying the fagots with which to burn heretics Another was given in the form of land in I66o for sup porting two scholars at a certain college but it had grown out of all conceivable rela tion to its original object The movement of reorganization has probably taken two forms I increasing old endowments 2 founding new schools In this way secondary education has been materially advanced 375THE SCHOOL REVIEW industrial efficiency Such a school is the Central Foundation School of London a fiveguinea school It was established at the time when the great cry arose as to the dearth of secondary education for the lower middle classes but it draws from various classes It receives boys between the ages of eight and seven teen and prepares them for business higher industrial or tech nical work and the civil service or for the university and polytechnic institute In the division of the school we meet with a new term What a grade is in our schools or a standard in the board schools here goes under the name of form The school is apparently divided into six forms but As and Bs and special forms raise the number to its first or second multiple so that various individual conditions can be met both as to rate of advancement and as to interest The course seems to be a uniform one up to about the fifth form or the adolescent age Then the boys specialize by taking work leading to the special ends in view it is thus a specialization in course rather than in studies The regular curriculum is natur ally a combination of elementary and secondary studies It is as follows The ordinary curriculum offers reading writing arithmetic grammar composition literature history geography mensuration Euclid algebra mechanics trigonometry French German elementary and advanced chem istry and physics theoretical and practical drawing various departments bookkeeping shorthand drill and gymnastics vocal music manual training In addition there are special classes in Latin Greek Hebrew higher mathe matics science etc which make it possible to meet requirements not pro vided for in the regular curriculum It is interesting to note that there is a school of science within this school which holds a position similar to that of the school of science which we found in connection with board and voluntary schools though more liberty seems to be allowed in this case Other schools like the old Manchester Grammar School the new Hulme Grammar School and the Manchester High School for Girls deserve a word in this connection They all prepare for the university but the majority of their graduates apparently enter professional life business life etc or take up technical work They are all well equipped to give good secondary courses and they give prominence to the continuous presenta 376SECONDARY EDUCATION IN ENGLISH SCHOOLS tion of great subjects Their organization is similar to that of the Central Foundation School though sometimes it is more elaborate and sometimes the age limits are higher Because of higher fees which range from nine to fifteen guineas 47 to 80 their relations to the popular schools cannot be intimate and they claim consideration here only as possible trainingground for scholarship students Such then are the facilities for popular secondary education Two deductions may here be made from this study I The children of the English popular schools have on the whole but meager opportunities for secondary education This state of things is further emphasized by the fact that a part of popular secondary education has been left without legal basis by the now famous Cockerton decision and is at present contin ued on sufferance Again what secondary education there is is plainly in a very unorganized state 2 English children fail to make fulluse of such opportunities as they have This is shown by the striking decrease in num bers in the years which mark the timeadvance beyond the ele mentary course Apathy in secondary education is apparent This is one side of the picture On the other side we should consider the fact that the aggregate number of pupils who are getting a taste of secondary education is large though compara tively very small and that interest in secondary education had power enough back of it to force a favorable amendment to the new bill Secondary education is not to be a waning factor in English popular education Compare all these conditions with those which prevail in our states where even the university is open to all who qualify themselves and imagine the restiveness which the English situ ation would cause in communities of highly developed educa tional sentiment and of independent spirit One need not go far among English boys and girls to find the pathos of the situa tion there From all that has been said it is evident that a selective prin There seems to have been a tacit understanding that the newer schools should graduate students into the older As this has not been faithfully carried out jealousy has arisen between them 377THE SCHOOL REVIEW ciple is operative in the English schools which form the subject of this article It may be said and is said that it brings out the bright boys and gives scope for individual initiative It does select the bright ones but it does so with a vengeance It punishes the many while rewarding the few Furthermore there is no guarantee that in the selective process it brings out the strongest I suspect the probability is that it does not At any rate it is a very narrow selective process and appropriates only a minimum of the nations best among the classes which we are considering Any system of higher education is select ive Our own system of free education is eminently such But it selects freely from the whole body of children and brings out a multitude of the best instead of a few This has its advan tage not merely through numbers but through the greater ver satility wider interest and larger power discovered in the num bers It is true such a system brings into higher education some weak subjects but it may do so with great advantage to the weak and to the community There are always natural limits but whenever a nation sets artificial limits to the growth of the individual it checks the growth of society and social feeling and eventually reaches a static condition or even retrogrades Eng land today faces a commercial and industrial situation which can be traced at least in appreciable degree to her educational organizations She has not a sufficient body of trained experts to meet the emergency and build up the industries she is losing to two or three nations which have been training these experts Happily the lines of education are not hard and fast in England They will give way according to proverbial English logic in meeting pressing conditions FRANK WEBSTER SMITH UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA 378

not discussed elaborately in the Di gest of the census but incidentally the views of Mr Ibbetson as to the close relation of occupation tribe religion and caste are sus tained by the unnamed official who prepared the Digest Among the 200 pages of tables one table shows  Class and name of caste Hereditary occupation ratios occupied in certain general pursuits and under  Remarks more definitely the numbers actually occupied in pursuits not hereditary The largest caste is the Kunbi or cultivators of the Maratha dis tricts and next the Mahar and Dhed unclean castes village servants Brahmans and Raj puts lead socially Over 830 castes are rec ognized the fortypage index for which unfor tunately was not bound in the copy of the Digest at hand Mr Bourdillon Bengal avoids discussion of caste farther than it was necessary for general tabulation of caste enu meration He quotes the instructions of the census committee of India in this  We have no hesitation in saying that there is no part of the work of compilation which presents so many difficulties involves so much labor and at the same time is so unsatisfactory when completed as the workingup of the caste tables The committee did not encourage minute research as to caste and it is only by a sort of crossexamination that we can trace Mr Bour dillons views as compared with Mr Ibbet sons Under caste however he speaks of  the interest of the caste question being much more ethnological than statistical the race idea The Bengal tables deal only with  JIin du castes  but Mr Bourdillon tells us under  Religions that The term  Hindu  now denotes neither a creed nor a race neither a church nor a people but is a general expression devoid of precision and embracing alike the most punctilious disciple of pure Vedantism the agnostic youth who is the product of western educa tion and the semibarbarous hillman who eats with out scruple any thing   and is as ignorant of the Hindu theology as the stone which he worships in times of danger And he quotes approvingly from Mr Bev erley   So does the Hindu religion in Bengal assume a Protean form from the austere rites practised by the shaven pundits of Nuddea to the idolworship of the semibarbarous Boona The Bauris    are prob ably all of aboriginal extraction but have adopted as their religion a form of Hinduism and can scarcely be classed as other than Hindus VOL IV No 98 In chapter ix after stating that the Gwalla or the cowherd caste is largest Brahmin sec ond in numbers Kaibartha husbandmen of lower Bengal third Mr Beverley says The Koch who occupy the fourth place afford a striking example of the way in which Hindu ism is replenished and goes on to explain how a people once with a language and a re ligion as well as a oovernment of its own has been absorbed by Islamism and Hinduism in which latter the converts are to all intents and purposes lowcaste EHindus Many names are given that are to be interpreted as occupation or as castes interchangeably and heredity of caste and of occupation is distinctly named Under  Religion Mr Beverley gives a general statement of absorption of aboriginal tribes into Hinduism their ruling classes being ab sorbed into the warrior caste while the com mon people became lowcaste Hindus The principal point on which there may be a diversity of view as to caste between the census officers is as to its existence among nonHindu peoples There is no evidence of antagonism in their general views and it is not clear that there would not be essential harmony if each wrote fully on the subject Other provincial census reports should short ly be received from India to aid our investi gations Meantime we may recognize some suggestions of caste in the relations of race occupation and social position among western nations In more than one locality in the United States a lady finds that her cook will not make a bed the chambermaid will not dress the infant the nurse will not broil a steak and with a houseful of servants no one will clean the clothes which are sent to a washerwoman Actual scavengers have hardly higher social rank in America than in India where distinction varying here with daily changes of wealth and of occupation become moulded into family and religious permanence Mr Ibbetson reminds us that  William Priest John King Edward Farmer and James Smith are but the survivals in England of the

curiously like an honest intent this book is a piece of absurd claptrap  utterly irrelevantSCIENCE deductions from monstrous assumptions affec tations of impossible learning mingled with a mass of mere jargon calculated to sound like science to the vulgar The whole makes such a farrago as might of itself send its writer to the lunaticasylum in which he would certainly prove a distinguished ornamentthat is if he is honest in his madness Still those who are minded to find  sermons in stones and good in every thing may get useful matter for re flection from it First he may learn that the palmist art of divination is one of the oldest and most wide spread as well as the longest to survive of superstitions It is perhaps natural that men should try to make some interpretations of the curiously varied lines of the human hand It would be easy for a primitive people to frame a fancy that the likeness and at the same time the variety of the lines in the hands of men had something akin to the like and the unlike elements of all mens lives It was perhaps from the everpresent longing for light on the great mystery that some one of old hit on the conjecture that these lines that toil gives to the hand were prophecies of the life that the mortal was to lead There at once sprang up systems of interpretation less apparently scien tific than those of the astrologers yet quite as credible and winning as much credence in the olden time as did the predictions of the star science There was a great mass of supersti tion of this same general nature afloat among all early peoples Astrology from the largeness of its claims and the dignity of its pretended subjectmatter the action of the stars has always held the first place in the hierarchy of humbugs Next comes the interpretation of dreams then divinations by signs then palm istry and at last a variety of less determined means of divination  the flight of birds the aspect of their entrails etc Where these notions have taken any strong hold upon the people they have certain common features that show them one and all to be the bastard brothers of true science They all rest upon that idea of likeness in nature which precedes the understanding of cause and effect Man is always ready to find the unexplored clouds of nature  very like a whale or  backed like a camel at the bidding of any one who will affect superior discernment and promise him to rend the futures veil The more remote the likeness the more undisciplined men will strain to note it and noting the more implicit their belief in it Such books as this mark the remains of the old truthsearching impulse which in its first 559 active shape gave us superstitions but which finally united with a critical spirit gave us true learning They indicate a stronger survival of the old spirit of superstition than is commonly supposed to continue in educated communities Divination has a higher place in the common mind than most welltrained men are disposed to believe even in our best educated commu nities it is still as of old a wellpaid profes sion In the leading paper of Cambridge Mass published within a stones throw of the university a professed divinator has kept for years a large businesslike and soberly worded advertisement of his services The circulation of this paper is not among the lower classes on the contrary its principal clientele is among the more intelligent people The present writer is informed that a good many speculators base their  futures on the predictions they obtain from these wizards We have managed to varnish our American people with an appear ance of modernisi  but our school system with its imperfect scientific training makes no efficient battle against these pernicious relics of the past It leaves the child without that sense of natural law which alone can overthrow such superstitions We cannot dismiss these indications of a low state of mind with the grin with which one is disposed to treat them That a consid erable part of our people still believe in witch craft is indeed a serious matter The machinery of our modern society rests on the theory that men are guided by a common sense of cause and effect In any serious turn of affairs when action must rest on the general ration ality of the people those who support these wizards will prove unfit for trust Our system of education should be shaped to meet this evil Children should be forced to see that they live under a reign of law to leave them longer with nothing to check this strong inher ent tendency to base superstition is to leave rotten timber in the ship of state NOTES AND NEWS THE coldwave flag whose use has been inau gurated by the signalservice during the past autumn is intended to be displayed not only at the regular stations of the signalservice but also at as many railwaystations and postoffices as possible in order to spread the widest notice of the coming change of weather The service cannot at present undertake to provide the flags or to pay for special telegrams to numerous local displaystations but the cost of the flags white six feet square with a twofoot black square in centre is moderate and

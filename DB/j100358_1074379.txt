J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1074379,ELECTIVE STUDIES WHERE,I244508,ELECTIVE STUDIESWHERE  PERMIT ME TO SAY BY WAY OF INTRODUCTORY EXPLANATION THAT THE SUBJECT AS PRINTED ON THE PROGRAMME IS HARDLY AN EXACT STATEMENT OF THE SUBJECT WHICH I WAS INVITED TO DISCUSS OR WHICH I AM TO DISCUSS THE QUESTION OF ELECTIVE COURSES IS NOT AT LEAST IN MICHIGAN AN OPEN ONE ALMOST IF NOT QUITE ALL HIGH SCHOOLS PROVIDE TWO OR MORE COURSES FROM WHICH THE PUPIL MAY CHOOSE WITH THE QUESTION OF ELECTIVE COURSES I SHALL DEAL IF AT ALL ONLY INCIDENTALLY THE TOPIC I AM TO CONSIDER IS THAT OF OPTIONAL OR ELECTIVE STUDIESNOT COURSESIN THE HIGH SCHOOL WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE WHERE OF SUCH OPTIONS PROVIDING THEY ARE OFFERED AT ALL BUT YOU WILL PARDON ME IF AT THE OUTSET I SUPPLEMENT WHAT PRINCIPAL SMITH HAS SO EXCELLENTLY SAID WITH A FEW CONSIDERATIONS ON THE LARGER AND MORE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION OF THE ADVISABILITY OF OPTIONSA QUESTION WHICH IS LOGICALLY ANTECEDENT TO THE MORE RESTRICTED INQUIRY THAT HAS BEEN SET BEFORE ME AND UPON THE ANSWER TO WHICH MUST DEPEND THE VERY EXISTENCE OF MY SUBJECT FOR TO DENY THE VALIDITY OF THE ARGUMENTS FOR THE USE OF OPTIONS IS TO LEAVE ME AND MY QUESTION ALIKE WITHOUT A PEG TO STAND UPON NO OPTIONS NO WHERE SAYS A WRITER IN THE NOVEMBER NUMBER OF THE EDUCATIONAL REVIEW IT CAN HAVE ESCAPED NO OBSERVANT EYE THAT A RATIONAL INTRODUCTION OF FREEDOM INTO THE HIGH SCHOOL IS RAPIDLY TAKING PLACE THE GROWING APPRECIATION OF THE PRACTICAL AND EDUCA TIONAL VALUE OF A LARGE GROUP OF NEWER SUBJECTS RENDERS IT IMPOS SIBLE LONGER TO MAINTAIN A HARDANDFAST COURSE OF STUDY IN THE SECONDARY SCHOOLS THE ELECTIVE SYSTEM IS GAINING GROUND AND SUPERINTENDENT SEAVER OF THE BOSTON MASS SCHOOLS IN THE OCTOBER NUMBER OF THE SAME MAGAZINE AFTER SPEAKING AT SOME LENGTH ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH SCHOOLS IN MASSACHU PAPER READ BEFORE THE MICHIGAN SCHOOLMASTERS CLUB 567THE SCHOOL REVIEW SETTS AND ESPECIALLY OF THE ADDED FUNCTIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED THEM BY REASON OF THE INCREASED RECOGNITION OF THE PLACE AND VALUE OF SOCALLED NONCLASSICAL STUDIES GIVES EXPRES SION TO THE FOLLOWING VIEWS WHAT WOULD MOST IMPROVE OUR PRESENT COURSE OF STUDY IN THE HIGH SCHOOLS IS A MUCH LARGER USE OF OPTIONS MOST OF THE STUDIES NOW REQUIRED SHOULD BE MADE ELECTIVE FROM AN AUTHOR IZED LIST OF ELECTIVE STUDIES THE PUPILS SHOULD CHOOSE EACH YEAR UNDER THE ADVICE OF PARENTS AND TEACHERS THOSE STUDIES WHICH APPEAR BEST SUITED TO THEIR SEVERAL NEEDS  CERTAIN STUDIES CONSIDERED TO BE ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL MIGHT BE REQUIRED OF ALL PUPILS ALIKE BUT SUCH STUDIES WOULD OCCUPY A RELATIVELY SMALL PART OF THE TIME THE OFFICIAL COURSE OF STUDY WOULD THEN BE A MERE INVENTORY OF THE STUDIES AUTHORIZED TO BE PURSUED IN THE HIGH SCHOOLS EACH DEFINED AS TO THE AMOUNT OF GROUND TO BE COVERED THE TOTAL ALLOWANCE OF TIME THEREFOR AND THE DEGREE OF PROFICIENCY TO BE REACHED THEREIN AS A CONDITION OF THE PUPILS RECEIVING A CERTIFICATE MR SEAVER THEN GOES ON WITH A SOMEWHAT EXTENDED ARGUMENT FOR THE USE OF ELECTIVE STUDIES WHICH IT WOULD BE WELL WORTH THE WHILE OF THOSE INTERESTED IN THE SUBJECT TO READ IT OCCURRED TO ME IN THE PRELIMINARY STAGES OF PREPARING THIS PAPER THAT IT WOULD BE OF GENUINE INTEREST TO THE CLUB AND ADD GREATLY TO THE VALUE OF THE DISCUSSION TO SECURE THE VIEWS OF SOME OF OUR BEST KNOWN EDUCATORS UPON THE QUESTION IN HAND WITH THIS IN MIND I WROTE TO FIVE OR SIX OF OUR MOST PROMINENT WORKERS AND OBTAINED THE REPLIES WHICH I NOW TAKE PLEASURE IN READING THE QUALITY WILL I THINK COMPENSATE FOR ANY LACK OF QUANTITY THE FIRST IS FROM DR NICHOLAS MURRAY BUTLER EDITOR OF THE EDUCATIONAL REVIEW AND WHILE SHORT IS TO THE POINT AND COVERS THE QUESTION AT STAKE THE SECOND LETTER IS FROM THE HON GEORGE B AITON STATE INSPECTOR OF HIGH SCHOOLS IN MINNESOTA WHOSE ADDRESS A YEAR AGO BEFORE THIS CLUB WE ALL REMEMBER WITH SUCH PLEASURE THE THIRD IS FROM DEAN C H THURBER OF THE MORGAN PARK ACADEMY EDITOR OF THE SCHOOL REVIEW THE FOURTH IS FROM PRINCIPAL W H SMILEY OF THE DENVER 568ELECTIVE STUDIES WHERE COLO HIGH SCHOOL ONE OF THE LEADING SECONDARY SCHOOLMEN IN THE COUNTRY THE LAST IS FROM SUPERINTENDENT A F NIGHTINGALE OF CHI CAGO WHO WRITES IN HIS USUAL VIGOROUS AND STRAIGHTFORWARD STYLE IN ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTIONS I BEG TO SAY THAT I BELIEVE IN A LIMITED USE OF OPTIONS IN THE HIGH SCHOOL I MAY EXPAND THIS ANSWER SUFFICIENTLY TO SAY THAT WHAT I HAVE IN MIND IS NOT AN OPTION THAT WOULD PERMIT THE STUDENT TO DESTROY THE SYMMETRY OF HIS SECONDARYSCHOOL COURSE BY OMITTING SOME INTEGRAL ELEMENT OF THAT COURSE SUCH AS LANGUAGE OR SCIENCE OR HISTORY BUT MERELY AN OPTION BETWEEN LANGUAGES SCIENCES OR TOPICS OR PERIODS OF HISTORICAL STUDY IN ANSWER TO YOUR SECOND QUESTION I WOULD SAY THAT THESE OPTIONS MAY PROFITABLY EXTEND I THINK THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE SECONDARYSCHOOL COURSE THEY MAY CERTAINLY BE USED TO ADVANTAGE IN THE LATTER HALF OF IT NICHOLAS MURRAY BUTLER GENERALLY SPEAKING OPTIONAL COURSES ARE ABOUT ALL THE LATITUDE WHICH CAN BE ALLOWED IN SCHOOLS OF SMALLER SIZE AND EVEN THEN THE FEWER THE COURSES THE BETTER FOR THE SCHOOL IN GENERAL IN FACT I DO NOT SEE HOW OPTIONAL SUB JECTS CAN BE PERMITTED UNLESS THE CLASSES ARE LARGE ENOUGH TO SECTION THE CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL OF MINNEAPOLIS HAS OVER FOUR HUNDRED FRESHMEN IN SUCH A BODY OPTIONAL SUBJECTS WOULD CREATE NO EMBARRASSMENT WHATEVER GENER ALLY SPEAKING SECONDARY STUDENTS ARE SO IMMATURE CORPS ARE SO SMALL AND OPTIONAL COURSES AFFORD SO LARGE A DEGREE OF FREEDOM THAT OPTIONAL SUBJECTS ARE NOT DESIRABLE TO US IN MINNESOTA AT LEAST THE QUESTION OF OPTIONAL SUBJECTS HAS AT PRESENT NO SIGNIFICANCE GEO B AITON IN GENERAL I AM IN FAVOR OF OPTIONS I CONSIDER THEM DESIRABLE AND PRACTICABLE BUT THEY MUST BE CAREFULLY GUARDED AS THE INTRODUCTION OF AN ELECTIVE SYSTEM INVOLVES A VAST AMOUNT OF CONSULTATION ON THE PART OF THE PRINCIPAL WITH THE PUPILS AND OFTEN WITH THE PARENTS WE PRACTICALLY HAVE THAT SYSTEM HERE AND I KNOW THAT THE TIME GIVEN TO CONSULTATION WITH STUDENTS IS GREATER THAN IN MOST SCHOOLS DETAILED OPINIONS ON THE VARIOUS POINTS YOU MAKE I DO NOT FEEL LIKE GIVING WITHOUT MORE THOUGHT THAN THE LIMITED TIME NOW AT MY COMMAND PERMITS CHAS H THURBER OUR SCHOOL HAS A TOTAL ENROLLMENT THUS FAR THIS YEAR OF ABOUT EIGHT HUN DRED AND TWENTYFIVE WE OFFER BUT TWO COURSES KNOWN AS THE GENERAL AND CLASSICAL COURSES THE GENERAL COURSE PROVIDES FOR FOUR YEARS INSTRUCTION IN EACH OF FOUR LINES OF WORK VIZ MATHEMATICS SCIENCE HIS TORY AND ENGLISH AND LANGUAGES THE CHOICE BEING BETWEEN LATIN AND GER 569THE SCHOOL REVIEW MAN THOSE WHO DESIRE FOR EXAMPLE THOSE CONTEMPLATING AN ADVANCED SCIENTIFIC COURSE MAY SUBSTITUTE FRENCH FOR HISTORY ENGLISH OR SCIENCE IN THE THIRD OR FOURTH YEARS OR FRENCH OR SPANISH FOR MATHEMATICS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS IN FHE LAST YEAR THOSE WHO CAN SHOW GOOD REASON FOR THE ELECTION MAY SUBSTITUTE A YEAR IN BIOLOGY FULL LABORATORY WORK FOR THE GEOLOGY AND ASTRONOMY WHICH ARE THE USUAL FOURTH YEAR SUBJECTS IN THE GENERAL COURSE THOSE WHO EXPECT TO PREPARE FOR COLLEGE ALTHOUGH THE SUBJECTS FOR ALL PUPILS ARE IN THE MAIN THE SAME DURING THE FIRST YEAR MAY TAKE GERMAN AND LATIN INSTEAD OF THE ELEMENTARY ZOOLOGY AND BOTANY OF THE FIRST YEAR THE PURPOSE OF THIS PERMISSION IS TO SECURE FOR THOSE WHO MUST HAVE A MODERN LANGUAGE IN ADDITION TO LATIN AND GREEK A YEAR MORE OF PREPARATION THAN IS SECURED BY TAKING UP FRENCH IN THE THIRD YEAR IT SHOULD BE REMEMBERED THAT IN THIS DISTRICT IS A THOROUGHLY EQUIPPED MANUAL TRAINING HIGH SCHOOL WITH A THREE YEARS COURSE STUDENTS MAY TAKE AN ADDITIONAL YEAR IF THEY DESIRE AND ALL GRADUATES OF THE EIGHTH GRADE HAVE FREE ELECTION BETWEEN THAT SCHOOL AND THIS THE ENROLLMENT IN THE LOWEST CLASS THERE IS ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY HERE TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THE ONLY OPTIONS ALLOWED ARE AS FOLLOWS FIRST YEAR LATIN OR GERMAN SECOND YEAR ENGLISH OR LATIN OR GERMAN THIRD YEAR ENGLISH OR LATIN OR GERMAN OR FRENCH IN PLACE OF MATHEMATICS OUR CLASSICAL COURSE PREPARES FOR HARVARD OR YALE AND DIFFERS LITTLE FROM THE USUAL METHOD PURSUED OUR PROGRAMME IS PROBABLY MORE CONSERVATIVE IN THE MATTER OF OPTIONS THAN MOST SCHOOLS OF ITS SIZE AND I SHALL ADVOCATE AN EXTENSION OF SUCH LIBERTY WHEN I CAN SECURE THE ADDITIONAL TEACHERS THAT SUCH EXTENSION WOULD RENDER NECESSARY WE HAVE FOUR YEARS OF ONE SUBJECT KNOWN AS HISTORY AND ENGLISH ROUGHLY SPEAKING IT CONSISTS OF HALF A YEAR EACH OF HISTORY AND ENGLISH I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HISTORY STAND SIDE BY SIDE WITH ENGLISH FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS EACH STUDY BEING GIVEN FOUR PERIODS PER WEEK AND CONTINUED FOR THE FULL YEAR A FULL YEAR IN POLITICAL ECONOMY SHOULD BE OFFERED IF SUCH COURSES COULD BE OFFERED THEN I BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE LARGE FREEDOM OF ELECTION SOME WOULD TAKE MORE OF HISTORY SOME OF ENGLISH SOME OF SCIENCE AND I THINK THERE WOULD BE STRONGER WORK IN EACH SUBJECT WM H SMILEY I SHOULD BE VERY MUCH SURPRISED AND ALARMED TO KNOW THAT MOST OF THE LARGER HIGH SCHOOLS HAVE NOT ADOPTED OPTIONS IN THE HIGHSCHOOL COURSE I DO NOT MEAN OPTIONS BETWEEN COURSES BUT OPTIONS IN STUDIES ABOUT ONE HALF OF THE WORK IN THE CHICAGO HIGH SCHOOLS IS REQUIRED THE OTHER HALF IS OPEN TO SELECTION BY THE PUPILS I INCLOSE YOU OUR COURSE OF STUDY YOU WILL SEE THAT FULL WORK IS TWENTY HOURS PER WEEK IN THE FIRST YEAR TWENTY FOUR HOURS ARE GIVEN THE SECOND YEAR THIRTYFOUR HOURS THIRD YEAR THIRTY EIGHT HOURS FOURTH YEAR FORTY HOURS SINCE IN EACH YEAR BUT TWENTY HOURS ARE REQUIRED FOR THE FULL COURSE YOU WILL AT ONCE OBSERVE THAT THERE ARE MANY OPTIONS YOU WILL NOTICE ALSO THAT WE HAVE BUT ONE COURSE OF STUDY AND THE 570ELECTIVE STUDIES WHERE PUPILS DIFFERENTIATE ACCORDING TO THEIR PURPOSES IF THEY ARE GOING TO COLLEGE THEY MUST MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE COLLEGE THEY EXPECT TO ENTER IF THEY ARE NOT GOING THEY HAVE A VERY LARGE CHOICE ON PAGES 21 AND 22 YOU WILL SEE WHAT WE ABSOLUTELY REQUIRE FOR GRADUATION OF COURSE THE SMALL HIGH SCHOOLS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE MORE THAN ONE COURSE AND PUPILS MAY BE REQUIRED TO TAKE IT WHERE IF THE SCHOOL IS LARGE ENOUGH AND THE PEOPLE WISE ENOUGH TO GIVE PARENTS AN OPPORTUNITY OF SELECTING FOR THEIR CHILDREN IT CERTAINLY OUGHT TO BE DONE IN CHICAGO WE SHALL HAVE MORE RATHER THAN FEWER OPTIONS I AM AN ARDENT ADVOCATE OF CLASSICAL STUDY BUT I AM THOROUGHLY CONVINCED OF THE TRUE STATEMENT THAT  WHAT IS ONE MANS MEAT IS ANOTHER MANS POISON AND SINCE THE HIGH SCHOOLS ARE THE SCHOOLS OF THE PEOPLE WE MUST AIM TO ACCOMMODATE THE PEOPLE WITHIN THE LENGTHS OF ALL REASONABLE DEMANDS A F NIGHTINGALE I HAD HOPED TO SECURE A LETTER ALSO FROM PROFESSOR HANUS OF HARVARD BUT AS HE IS IN EUROPE IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO HEAR FROM HIM BEFORE THE MEETING OF THIS CLUB IN AN EFFORT TO GIVE THE DISCUSSION A PRACTICAL AND DEFINITE TURN AND TO PRESENT IN A CONCRETE FORM THE QUESTION OF WHERE SUCH OPTIONS MAY ADVANTAGEOUSLY APPEAR IN A HIGHSCHOOL PRO GRAMME I HAVE OUTLINED A COURSE WITH LARGE OPTIONS DESIGNED TO PREPARE FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN IN PARTICULAR AND AS WELL TO OFFER SUCH ADDITIONAL AND OPTIONAL STUDIES AS MAY SERVE AS A SUITABLE PREPARATION FOR LIFE IN CASE THE STUDENT IS UNABLE TO ENTER COLLEGE AS BY FAR THE LARGER PROPORTION OF HIGHSCHOOL PUPILS ARE INCLUDED IN THIS LAST CATEGORY I AM SURE I NEED OFFER NO APOLOGIES FOR HAVING AN EYE TO THEIR INTERESTS AND GOOD A PROPOSED HIGHSCHOOL COURSE WITH OPTIONS FIRST

GIVEN TO THAT SUBJECT PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY MAY VERY WELL BE REQUIRED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES TO FILL UP THE REQUISITE NUMBER OF HOURS ALTHOUGH THERE ARE BUT NINE 9 HOURS OF PRESCRIBED WORK IN THE FIRST HALF OF THIS GRADE APPARENTLY ALLOWING TWO 2 ELECTIONS IT IS NOT SO DESIGNED THE TRANSITION FROM THE GRAMMAR GRADE TO THE HIGH SCHOOL IS SO TRYING TO MANY PUPILS THAT IT IS THOUGHT FOURTEEN 14 HOURS SHOULD BE ALL THAT ARE REQUIRED 572ELECTIVE STUDIES WHERE 2 IN CASE A COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY MAKES CHEMISTRY INSTEAD OF BOTANY THE SECOND REQUIRED SCIENCE AS MANY COLLEGES DO BOTANY MAY BE PLACED IN THE LIST OF ELECTIVES OF THE FIRST YEAR AND CHEMISTRY BE PUT IN THE PRESCRIBED LIST BEGINNING WITH THE SECOND HALF OF THE THIRD YEAR OR THE FIRST HALF OF THE FOURTH 3 WHEREVER IT IS FOUND NECESSARY TO GIVE MORE THAN TWO YEARS TO THE PREPARATORY WORK IN GREEK THAT OPTION MAY BE ALLOWED IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE SECOND YEAR 4 WHERE FRENCH AND GERMAN CAN BE TAUGHT FOR TWO YEARS ONLY THE LANGUAGE OPTIONS WILL HAVE TO BE LESSENED UNLESS BEGINNING CLASSES BE AGAIN ALLOWED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD YEAR IN PREPARING THIS I TOOK THE FOUR GROUPS OF ADMISSION REQUIRE MENTS AS PUBLISHED IN THE LAST CALENDAR OF THE UNIVERSITY AND SELECTED THE STUDIES COMMON TO ALL FOUR GROUPS I FOUND THESE TO BE ENGLISH PRESUMABLY CONTINUING THROUGH THE WHOLE FOUR YEARS HISTORY ONE YEARS WORK MATHEMATICS INCLUDING A YEAR EACH OF ALGEBRA AND GEOMETRY SCIENCE INCLUDING A YEAR OF PHYSICS AND A HALF YEAR OF BOTANY AND FINALLY AS THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT TWO YEARS OF WORK IN SOME FOREIGN LANGUAGE AS THERE IS REALLY AN OPTION HOWEVER IN THIS LAST REQUIREMENTTHE PUPIL HAVING A CHOICE AS BETWEEN LATIN FRENCH GERMAN AND GREEK AND AS THERE ARE MANY PUPILS NOT PREPARING FOR COLLEGE OF WHOM NO FOREIGN LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT IS DEMANDED THE ONLY BRANCHES PLACED IN THE PRESCRIBED COLUMN ARE ENGLISH HISTORY MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE TO THE EXTENT OUTLINED ABOVE THE WORK IN THESE FOUR LINES IS TO BE DONE BY ALL WHETHER PRE PARING FOR COLLEGE OR NOT FROM THE LARGE RANGE OF STUDIES PRESENTED IN THE ELECTIVE COLUMN A SUFFICIENT NUMBER MUST BE CHOSEN TO ANSWER THE REQUIREMENTS FOR GRADUATION VIZ A TOTAL OF 137 HOURS OF RECITA TION WORK DIVIDED AS FOLLOWS FIRST YEAR 31 HOURS SECOND YEAR 34 HOURS THIRD YEAR 36 HOURS FOURTH YEAR 36 HOURS THAT THE PROPOSED COURSE GIVES ALL OR NEARLY ALL THAT SHOULD BE ABSOLUTELY IMPOSED UPON THE PUPIL IS WE BELIEVE CLEARLY DEMONSTRABLE IN THE INSISTENCE UPON THE STUDY OF ENGLISH FOR AN AVERAGE OF THREE PERIODS A WEEK FOR THE FOUR YEARS WE ARE EXACTING FROM THE PUPIL ONLY THE TRIBUTE DUE TO HIS MOTHER TONGUE  A TRIBUTE WE ARE SURE OF WHICH ALL WILL ADMIT THE JUS 573THE SCHOOL REVIEW TICE AND WHICH ALL WILL WILLINGLY PAY NO PUPIL SHOULD BE GRAD UATED FROM THE HALLS OF THE HIGH SCHOOL WHO HAS NOT FORMED SOME MEASURE OF ACQUAINTANCESHIP WITH THE GREAT THINKERS OF OUR RACE AND SOME APPRECIATION OF THE BEAUTIES OF HIS OWN LITERA TURE AND GAINED SOME EVEN INADEQUATE CONCEPTION OF THE UNTOLD WEALTH THAT LIES AT HIS FEET NO JUSTIFICATION WILL BE DEMANDED AND NO APOLOGY WILL BE NECESSARY THEREFORE FOR THE INSERTION OF THE STUDY OF ENGLISH AMONG THE INDISPENSABLE CONCOMITANTS OF A HIGHSCHOOL EDUCATION AS TO MATHEMATICS THERE MAY NOT BE QUITE THE UNANIMITY OF OPINION THAT THERE IS AS TO THE PLACE OF ENGLISH BUT STILL THE VAST MAJORITY OF EDUCATORS WILL I BELIEVE BE FOUND TO DEFEND ITS CLAIM TO AN UNDISPUTED POSITION IN THE PROPERLY CONSTRUCTED CURRICULUM AND TO QUESTION THE DISCIPLINARY AND EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF THE COURSE WHICH FAILS TO PRESCRIBE IT IT STILL HOLDS AN UNRIVALED PLACE AMONG THE STUDIES DESIGNED TO CULTIVATE THE POWER OF LOGICAL AND EXACT REASONING AND WE DOUBT MUCH WHETHER ANY EDUCATION IS ADEQUATE TO THE END IN VIEW WHICH SHIFTS IT FROM ITS HONORED POSITION IT IS TRUE THAT THE GENERAL COURSE WHICH PRINCIPAL GOODWIN OF NEWTON MASS DESCRIBES IN THE EDUCATIONAL REVIEW FOR FEBRU ARY I893 DOES NOT INCLUDE MATHEMATICS AMONG THE REQUIRED STUDIES BUT TO THAT EXTENT I MUST HOLD HIS COURSE IS DEFICIENT AND OPEN TO THE CRITICISM WHICH OPPONENTS OF THE OPTIONAL SYS TEM WILL BE ONLY TOO QUICK TO BRING VIZ THAT ITS TENDENCY IS TO LOWER THE EDUCATIONAL STANDARD AS TO SCIENCE THERE WILL PROBABLY BE LITTLE IF ANY CRITICISM UPON THE CLAIMS WHICH IT ADVANCES FOR SOME MEASURE OF RECOG NITION AS A PRESCRIBED STUDY THE FACT THAT A YEAR AND A HALF OF SCIENCE WORK APPEARS IN ALL FOUR ADMISSION GROUPS IS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE OF A RECOGNITION OF ITS RIGHTS IT MAY BE AN OPEN QUESTION WHETHER THE ELEMENTS OF CHEMISTRY IS NOT THE SECOND SCIENCE TO BE INSISTED UPON AND DEMANDED OF THE PROPERLY TRAINED PUPIL BUT THAT IS A QUESTION WHICH SCIENTIFIC EXPERTS MUST SETTLE AMONG THEMSELVES AND IT IS NOT IN ME TO BE SO RASH AS TO VEN TURE WHERE ANGELS FEAR TO TREAD THAT POINT HOWEVER IS A SEC ONDARY ONE AND HAS NO DIRECT BEARING UPON THE LEGITIMACY OF 574ELECTIVE STUDIES WHERE  THE CLAIMS FOR SOME SCIENTIFIC STUDY ON THE PART OF THE WOULDBE GRADUATE THE MARVELOUS ACHIEVEMENTS OF SCIENCE IN THE PAST FIFTY YEARS ITS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE WELLBEING OF MANKIND ITS WONDERFUL POSSIBILITIES ITS EDUCATIVE AND DISCIPLINARY VALUE WHEN PROPERLY TAUGHT AND STUDIEDALL THESE FURNISH ABUNDANT REASONS WHY SCIENCE SHOULD HAVE A PRESCRIBED PLACE IN THE SEC ONDARYSCHOOL COURSE AS TO HISTORYTHE STORY OF THE PROGRESS OF THE RACEWHO WOULD OMIT IT FROM ANY WELL CONSTRUCTED OR RIGHTLY BALANCED COURSE INDEED I MAY BE CRITICISED FOR NOT PLACING AMERICAN HISTORY IN THE LIST OF PRESCRIBED STUDIES BUT MY EXCUSE IS FIRST THAT IT IS NOT ONE OF THE BRANCHES COMMON TO THE FOUR GROUPS OF ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS AND SECOND THAT IT SHOULD BE TAUGHT IN THE GRAMMAR GRADES AND THEREFORE NEED ONLY BE GIVEN IN THE HIGH SCHOOL TO THOSE WHO WISH TO STUDY THE SUBJECT SOMEWHAT MORE FULLY AND CAREFULLY THE CASE FOR PRESCRIBED STUDIES IS IN AND WHILE NO DETAILED ARGUMENT HAS BEEN OFFERED OR ATTEMPTED BY WAY OF JUSTIFYING THEIR PRESENCE ENOUGH HAS BEEN SAID I TRUST TO INDICATE THE MAIN GROUND FOR THEIR RIGHT TO THE CLAIM OF PRESCRIBED STUDIES I FEAR LESS CRITICISM ALONG THE LINE OF THE PRESCRIBED STUDIES THAN I DO REGARDING THE POSITION OF SOME STUDIES PLACED IN THE OPTIONAL OR ELECTIVE COLUMN IT MAY BE ASKED WHY THE LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT IS NOT PLACED IN THE PRESCRIBED COLUMN SO THAT ALL STUDENTS WHETHER PREPARING FOR THE UNIVERSITY OR NOT SHOULD HAVE SOME LINGUISTIC TRAINING OF COURSE ALL PUPILS LOOKING FORWARD TO A COLLEGE COURSE WILL TAKE AT LEAST TWO YEARS OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE WORK THE QUESTION IS SHALL THOSE WHO HAVE NO HOPE OF GOING TO COLLEGE BE REQUIRED TO TAKE A CORRESPONDING AMOUNT OF LATIN GERMAN OR FRENCH BEFORE THEY ARE ALLOWED TO GRADUATE ON THIS POINT I AM INCLINED TO GRANT SOME LIBERTY OF CHOICE AND IN SPITE OF A VIVID APPRECIATION OF THE VALUE OF THE STUDY OF A FOREIGN TONGUE TO HOLD THAT IT IS BETTER TO GIVE SOME FREEDOM ALONG THIS LINE THAN TO LOSE THE PUPIL ALTOGETHER FROMTHE SCHOOL THIS IS THE ATTI TUDE IN EFFECT OF ALL SCHOOLS THAT OFFER A SOCALLED ENGLISH OR COMMERCIAL COURSE SO THAT NO STRANGE DOCTRINE IS HERE ADVANCED 575THE SCHOOL REVIEW THERE ARE MANY PUPILS IN A HIGH SCHOOL TO WHOM LINGUISTIC WORK OF ANY KIND IS HOPELESSLY DIFFICULT AND DEPRESSINGLY DISCOURAGING AND WHETHER THEY MIGHT NOT BETTER BE GIVEN SUCH FOOD AS IS ATTUNED TO THEIR MENTAL STOMACHS THAN TO LOSE ALTOGETHER WHAT A HIGHSCHOOL EDUCATION MAY GIVE IS A VERY SERIOUS QUESTION AND NOT TO BE ANSWERED TOO AIRILY FOR MYSELF I AM INCLINED TO ERR IF IT IS TO ERRON THE SAFE SIDE AND TO GIVE BY EVERY REASON ABLE CONCESSION THE BENEFITS OF A HIGHSCHOOL EDUCATION TO ALL WHO WILL AVAIL THEMSELVES OF IT GIVEN A WELLEQUIPPED HIGH SCHOOL AND A PROGRESSIVE AND INSPIRING CORPS OF TEACHERS YES GIVE ONLY THE LIVE AND CULTURED TEACHER AND NO STUDY WILL BE WITHOUT VALUE AND NO PUPIL WILL PASS FROM HIS INFLUENCE WITHOUT RECEIVING AN UNMEASURED STORE OF GOODINSPIRATION TASTES HABITS THAT MAY ENRICH A LIFETIME IN A LAND WHERE EDUCATED AND TRAINED CITIZENSHIP IS OF SUCH TRANSCENDANT IMPORTANCE IN A LAND WHOSE VERY EXISTENCE DEPENDS UPON THE INTELLIGENCE AND SOBERMINDEDNESS OF ITS CITIZENS IN A LAND WHERE THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF OUR FELLOWCITIZENS HAVE ATTAINED SUCCESS AND VIGOROUS MENTALITY LET US NOT BE TOO INSISTENT UPON THIS OR THAT SPECIFIC BRANCH OF STUDY BUT LET US RATHER DO ALL THAT IS REASON ABLE IN BROADENING THE HORIZON DEEPENING THE CULTURE STRENGTH ENING THE INTELLECT AND ENNOBLING THE IDEAS OF AS MANY AS WE CAN BRING WITHIN THE REACH OF OUR INFLUENCE J H HARRIS 576

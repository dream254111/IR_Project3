J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1012374,GOOD OPPORTUNITIES FOR PRISON LABOR,I242631,III GOOD OPPORTUNITIES FOR PRISON LABOR BY HARRIS R COOLEY COMMISSIONER OF CHARITIES CLEVELAND O THE CORRECTION FARM OF CLEVELAND IS A PART OF A GREAT TRACT OF NEARLY TWO THOUSAND ACRES OR MORE THAN THREE SQUARE MILES ON WHICH ARE THE TUBERCULOSIS GROUP THE ALMSHOUSE GROUP AND ALSO AN EXTENSIVE MUNICIPAL CEMETERY TO BE GRADED AND DEVELOPED BY PRISON LABOR THE AREA IS SO LARGE AND DIVERSIFIED THAT THE ALMSHOUSE GROUP IS A MILE AND A HALF FROM THE CORRECTION GROUP AND TWO HUN DRED FEET HIGHER EACH OF THE FOUR DIVISIONS IS DISTINCT ON ITS OWN ESTATE OF FIVE HUNDRED ACRES IN SEVEN YEARS OVER EIGHT THOUSAND MEN HAVE SERVED TIME OUT ON THE FARM WE HAVE FOUND IT AN ESPECIAL ADVANTAGE THAT THE CORRECTION FARM IS A PART OF A GROUP OF FOUR ESTATES COMPRISING THE TWO THOU SAND ACRES IT SECURES THE ABSOLUTE CONTROL BY THE CITY OF A VAST ENVIRONMENT OF MORE THAN THREE SQUARE MILES IN THE COLONY OR ALMSHOUSE GROUP AND THE TUBERCULOSIS GROUP THERE ARE MANY WHO CAN ONLY DO LIGHT WORK IF THERE IS TO BE FURNISHED A LARGE OPPOR TUNITY FOR LIGHT WORK IN THE FIELDS AND GARDENS AS A BASIS FOR THIS THERE MUST ALSO BE A LARGE AMOUNT OF ROUGH HEAVY WORK THIS CAN READILY BE SUPPLIED FROM THE STRONG HARDY MEN OF THE HOUSE OF CORRECTION THUS THE INSTITUTIONS SUPPLEMENT EACH OTHER IN THE FULLEST DEVELOPMENT OF THE FARM IF THERE COMES AS A PRISONER AN EXPERT CARPENTER WE CAN SET HIM TO WORK IN THE LIGHT AIRY SHOPS OF THE CORRECTION BUILDINGS MAKING MISSION CHAIRS AND TABLES FOR THE OLD PEOPLE HE IS WORKING AT HIS BEST WHICH IS GOOD FOR HIM IN ADDITION HE IS CONSCIOUS OF ADDING TO THE COMFORT OF SOME AGED OR CRIPPLED OR SICK RESIDENT OF THE FARMS IN THE SPRING OF 1905 WE BEGAN IN CLEVELAND THE OUTDOOR TREAT MENT OF CRIME BY TAKING TRUSTIES AND OTHER PRISONERS FROM THE CITY WORKHOUSE TO OUR FARMS AND LODGING THEM IN THE OLD SCATTERED HOUSES OUR FARMER NEIGHBORS WERE FRIGHTENED OUR FRIENDS PRO PHESIED THAT THE PRISONERS WOULD ALL RUN AWAY BUT THE PLAN WORKED MOST OF THE MEN COMPLETED THEIR SENTENCES GIVING FAITHFUL AND 92GOOD OPPORTUNITIES FOR PRISON LABOR WILLING SERVICE WE OURSELVES HAVE BEEN SURPRISED AT TIMES AT THE RESULTS OF SOME OF OUR VENTURES WITH THESE MEN THE CONFIDENCE PLACED IN THEM THE USEFUL WORK IN GARDEN AND FIELD THE TONIC OF THE SKY AND TREES DEVELOPED A NEW SENSE OF HONOR AND A COMMON SENTI MENT THAT IT IS A MEAN AND COWARDLY THING TO RUN AWAY FROM THE FARM A VISITING JUDGE SAID TO ME IT IS SO FINE OUT HERE I SHOULD BE AFRAID SOME OF THE PRISONERS WOULD WANT TO STAY NEARBY A GROUP OF THE MEN WERE SHOVELING DIRT INTO A GRADING WAGON I SAID TO HIM JUDGE YOU SEE THOSE MEN AT WORK THEY ARE DRINKING AN ABUNDANCE OF PURE WATER THEY EAT HEARTILY THEY SLEEP WELL THEY SAY TO THEMSELVES THIS IS NOT MADE WORK THIS IS REAL GENUINE WORK FREE MEN RIGHT OVER THERE ARE GETTING A DOLLAR AND A HALF A DAY FOR DOING THIS THE OLD PRISON CELL THE FOOD THE CONFINEMENT OF THEIR LABOR TENDED TO DEPRESS THEM AND TO MAKE THEM HOPELESS THIS TREATMENT QUICKLY BRINGS THEM TO THEMSELVES AND AROUSES THE NORMAL MAN THERE IS A PSYCHOLOGICAL ELEMENT WHICH YOU HAVE NOT THOUGHT OF AND WHICH WE DID NOT FULLY FORESEE WHICH MAKES THESE MEN MORE ANXIOUS TO GO BACK AND AGAIN TAKE THEIR PLACES IN SOCIETY AND INDUSTRY AT THE EXPIRATION OF THEIR SENTENCES THEY GO OUT WITHOUT THE PRISON PALLOR STRONGER IN THE FACE OF TEMPTATION AND READY AT ONCE TO DO A FULL DAYS WORK THERE IS A MARKED DIFFERENCE IN THE FEELING OF THE PRISONERS THEY WORK MUCH MORE HEARTILY SOME OF THEM TAKE GREAT INTEREST IN THE ANIMALS AND THE GROWING FRUITS VEGETABLES AND GRAINS THEY ARE FREER FROM JAIL SULLENNESS AND HANGDOG WAYS WHEN THE CONTRACTOR WAS READY TO START ON OUR CORRECTION SQUARE THERE DEVELOPED AN UNEXPECTED SCARCITY OF WATER WE BUILT A CON CRETE DAM DUG OUT THE EARTH FOR A POND LAID OVER A MILE OF TWO INCH PIPE AND IN FIVE AND A HALF DAYS HAD AN ABUNDANCE OF WATER WITH FORTY POUNDS GRAVITY PRESSURE THE WORKHOUSE MEN ENTERED INTO THIS EMERGENCY WORK WITH AS MUCH EARNESTNESS AND ENTHUSIASM AS IF IT WERE THEIR OWN THIS SPRING OUT OF A GROUP OF FOURTEEN PRISONERS WE ASKED FOR FOUR MEN TO VOLUNTEER TO WORK ON SUNDAY IN THE SUGAR CAMP THE ENTIRE FOURTEEN FREELY OFFERED THEIR SERVICES IN THE SAVING OF A LARGE RUN OF SAP THE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE WHICH WE OF NECESSITY PLACE IN THEM CALL FORTH THE REMNANT OF MANLINESS WHICH ASSERTS ITSELF ITS WHOLE TENDENCY IS TO DEVELOP IN THEM A SPIRIT OF HONOR TO DO ONES WORK 93THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY AND TO PUT AWAY THE THOUGHT OF ESCAPE THEIR LANGUAGE ABOUT IT CHANGES TO BREAK OUT OF THE OLD PRISON IS A GETAWAY TO RUN AWAY FROM THE FARM IS TO TAKE A SNEAK THEY HAVE BETTER AIR TO BREATHE AND BETTER FOOD TO EAT AND LIKE THE REST OF US THEIR DISPOSITIONS ARE THEREFORE MORE AGREEABLE THEY HAVE AN ABUNDANCE OF FRESH VEGETABLES IN SEASON FOR THEY RAISE THEM BY THEIR OWN LABOR IN THEIR GARDENS OF THESE OPPORTUNITIES FOR USEFUL WORK ONE OF THE MOST PROMIS ING IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CEMETERY WHEN DEVELOPED THIS WILL BE A MAGNIFICENT MUNICIPAL CEMETERY OF FIVE HUNDRED ACRES WHICH WILL BRING BACK SEVERAL MILLIONS INTO THE CITYS TREASURY THE DEVELOPMENT IS LARGELY IN THE NATURE OF WALKS AND DRIVES AND THE PLANTING OF TREES AND SHRUBS ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT STATISTICS PRISON LABOR IS MOST EFFECTIVE IN BUILDING ROADS THESE ROADS ARE PRIVATE AND ARE THUS FREE FROM THE OBJECTIONS OF THE PUBLIC HIGH WAY AGAIN WORKING IN THE CEMETERY MAY HAVE SOME MORAL EFFECT ON THE PRISONERS ALLOWING MORE THAN HALF THE ACRE FOR DRIVES AND PLANTING THERE WOULD BE IN EACH ACRE TWENTY THOUSAND SQUARE FEET STILL TO BE SOLD AS LOTS FIFTY CENTS PER SQUARE FOOT IS A MODERATE AMOUNT TO BE PAID FOR A BURIAL LOT IN A LARGE WELLKEPT CEMETERY THIS WOULD AMOUNT TO 10000 AN ACRE THIS AMOUNT OF COURSE IS NOT REALIZED AT ONCE AND MUST INCLUDE AND PROVIDE FOR FUTURE MAINTENANCE BUT TO THOSE MUNICIPALITIES WHICH MAINTAIN CEMETERIES IT PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PROFITABLE USE OF PRISON LABOR IT IS GOOD FOR THE PRISONERS TO WORK IN THE OPEN AND BECAUSE OF ITS RETURNS IT WILL JUSTIFY THE MUNICIPALITY IN PAYING AT LEAST A PART OF WHAT THE PRISONERS EARN TO THEIR FAMILIES THERE ARE LIMITATIONS OF COURSE TO THE OUTDOOR METHOD OF TREAT MENT NOT ALL OF THE MEN COMMITTED CAN BE TRUSTED TO WORK IN THE FIELDS BESIDES THOSE WHO ARE LOCKED IN WE HAVE TWO CLASSES THE TRUSTIES AND THE SEMITRUSTIES THE SEMITRUSTIES WORK IN GANGS OF TWENTY OR THIRTY WITH GUARDS OR RATHER FOREMEN ALWAYS PRESENT THEY ARE KEPT IN THE ENCLOSURE SUNDAYS AND HOLIDAYS WE SELDOM HAVE A MAN DROP HIS TOOLS AND RUN THE TEMPTATION COMES WHEN NOT WORKING THE TRUSTIES WORK ON THE FARM SOMETIMES ENTIRELY ALONE WITH THIS METHOD I AM CONFIDENT THAT ONEHALF THE MEN CAN WORK UNDER THE OPEN SKY NEAR THE CLOSE OF THEIR SENTENCES IT IS 94GOOD OPPORTUNITIES FOR PRISON LABOR USUALLY SAFE TO ASSIGN OUTSIDE WORK EVEN TO THE MORE SERIOUS OFFEND ERS ALL OF THE MEN CAN AT LEAST BE ALLOWED THE FREEDOM OF THE GREAT OPEN COURT IN CLEVELAND WE HAVE MANY PRISONERS SENT TO THE HOUSE OF COR RECTION FOR VAGRANCY SOME OF THEM ARE SELFCOMMITTED IT IS NEEDLESS TO ENFORCE THE STRICTEST DISCIPLINE IN THESE CASES IF THE MEN RUN AWAY AND TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES THE PURPOSE OF THE LAW HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED IF THEY DISAPPEAR THE RESULT IS MUCH THE SAME AS WHEN THE COURT ORDERS THEM TO LEAVE TOWN IF THEY ARE REALLY SEEKING WORK THEY STAY WITH US AS WE CAN HELP THEM TO FIND EMPLOYMENT THESE CASES MAKE OUR REPORTS OF ESCAPES WHICH ARE TEN PER CENT SEEM LARGE BUT IT HAS PROVED THE BEST METHOD OF DEAL ING WITH OUR PROBLEM A PENITENTIARY OR STATE REFORMATORY MUST OF COURSE BE ORGANI IZED AND MANAGED DIFFERENTLY THE GENERAL METHOD HAS BEEN TRIED IN MANY PLACES AT WITZWILL SWITZERLAND IS A LARGE TRACT OF NEARLY TWO THOUSAND ACRES WITH TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PRISONERS UNDER SENTENCES FOR AS LONG AS FIVE YEARS AT MERXPLAS TWENTYFIVE MILES FROM ANTWERP IS A GREAT ESTATE WITH FIVE THOUSAND PRISONERS SOME OF THEM WITH SENTENCES AS LONG AS SEVEN YEARS THESE FIVE THOUSAND IRREGULARS AND UNFORTUNATES ARE CONTROLLED AND DIRECTED BY A STAFF OF ONLY EIGHTY WARDENS OUT OF A BARREN WASTE THEY HAVE MADE A MILLIONDOLLAR ESTATE IN THE BERLIN LABOR HOUSE AT RUMMELSBURG OUT OF TWO THOUSAND PRISONERS ONE THOUSAND WORK OUTSIDE ON THE GREAT SEWAGE FARMS OWNED BY THE MUNICIPALITY IN FRANCE HOLLAND HUNGARY AND ITALY THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE SUCCESSFUL EXPERIMENTS WITH THE COLONY SYSTEM FOR THE TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS ON THIS SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC IN THE PROVINCE OF ONTARIO IN COLORADO IN MISSOURI IN CALIFORNIA AND IN THE CITY OF WASHINGTON A SIMILAR WORK IS CARRIED ON OF NECESSITY MUCH DEPENDS ON THE PERSONALITY OF THE WARDEN AND HIS ABILITY TO HAVE HIS SUBORDINATES OF LIKE SPIRIT TOO MUCH EMPHASIS CANNOT BE GIVEN TO THE ATTITUDE AND THE PERSONALITY OF THOSE IN CHARGE WITH THE RIGHT SPIRIT AND WISDOM IN THE OFFICIALS THERE IS NO REASON WHY THIS OUTDOOR METHOD MAY NOT BE ADAPTED TO ALL OF OUR PENAL INSTITUTIONS THE GROWING FEELING OF INTEREST ON THE PART OF THE PUBLIC IN THE WORK OF THE FARM AND THE FACT THAT THE MEN ARE REALLY DOING USEFUL WORK ARE NOW RAISING THE QUESTION WHETHER SOCIETY OUGHT NOT 95THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY TO ALLOW THE FAMILY OF THE PRISONER AT LEAST A PART OF WHAT HE EARNS AND ALSO WHETHER HE SHOULD NOT HAVE SOMETHING PAID TO HIM AT RELEASE SO THAT HE WILL BE BETTER FITTED TO TAKE AGAIN A NORMAL PLACE IN LIFE THIS AWAKENED FEELING TOWARD PRISONERS IS EXPRESSING ITSELF IN PROBATION AND PAROLE IN PRISON SCHOOLS IN HOMES AND IN EMPLOY MENT BUREAUS FOR RELEASED MEN IT IS ALSO STRENGTHENING PUBLIC SENTIMENT THAT PRISON MANAGEMENT SHOULD BE UTTERLY DIVORCED FROM PARTISAN POLITICS AT CLEVELAND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THE CORRECTION FARM HAS DEMONSTRATED IS THAT THE CITY HAS BECOME KINDER AND BROADER WITH ITS MORE RATIONAL AND HUMANE TREATMENT OF ITS PRISONERS THE HEART OF CLEVELAND HAS GROWN IN ITS SENSE OF RIGHT AND JUSTICE IN STEAD OF CONTEMPT AND MALICE THERE HAS COME A DESIRE TO KNOW THE PATH UP WHICH THE CRIME HAS COME AND THE GENERAL DISPOSITION TO GIVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR NORMAL LIVES THE REFLEX INFLUENCE IS REALLY THE LARGER PART OF THE BENEFIT FOR ITS OWN SAKE SOCIETY CANNOT AFFORD TO BE CRUEL AND BRUTAL TO ITS MEANEST AND MOST UNWORTHY MEMBER RUSSIA IS TO REAP A MORE BITTER HARVEST THAN HER EXILES LOVE YOUR ENEMIES IS A GOOD SOCIAL LAW EVEN THOUGH ALL THE PRISONERS DO NOT AT ONCE RESPOND TO THIS TREATMENT AND MAKE GOOD THIS DOES NOT DESTROY TO SOCIETY THE QUALITY OF THIS MERCY OLD METHODS OFTEN MADE INSTITUTIONS OF DETENTION BREEDING PLACES FOR DISEASE AND SCHOOLS FOR CRIME RECENT RESEARCH HAS BROUGHT TO LIGHT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE THREE TIMES AS MUCH TUBERCULOSIS AMONG OUR PRISONERS AS IN OUR GENERAL POPULATION THE MORAL CONTAGION IS REVOLTING THE VILEST DEEDS LIKE POISON WEEDS BLOOM WELL IN PRISON AIR IT IS ONLY WHAT IS GOOD IN MAN THAT WASTES AND WITHERS THERE CIVILIZATION AND PROGRESS NO LONGER HALT AT THE PRISON DOORS WINSTON CHURCHILL DECLARED IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS THAT THE ATTITUDE OF THE PUBLIC IN REGARD TO THE TREATMENT OF CRIME AND CRIMI NALS IS ONE OF THE BEST TESTS OF THE CIVILIZATION OF ANY COUNTRY THE GENERAL MOVEMENT OF WHICH THE COLONY IS A PART IS BOTH TIMELY AND WISE 96

mistake as to the extent of the employees injuries is not a ground for setting aside the latter Dotson v Proctor  Gamble Mfg Co 102 Kan 248 169 Pac 1136 But it would seem that as to arbitral awards the converse is true See dictum in Weathers v Kansas City Bridge Co 99 Kan 632 162 Pac 957 A release given in full settlement of all claims under the Workmens Compensation Act and approved by the Industrial Accident Board will not bar an action by the injured employee to recover additonal compen sation to which he is entitled under the Compensation Act where the employer and his insurer fail to report to the Board the full extent and nature of the injury sustained Green v Buick Motor Co Mich 166 N W 1028 MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONSINVALID BONDSLIABILITIES TO HOLDERSThe City of Henderson by its

statute are invalid Central Branch Union Pacific R Co v Smith 23 Kan 745 Whaley v Gail lard 21 S C 560 But where one in good faith lends money to a mu nicipal corporation to be used for a corporate purpose and takes bonds therefor he is entitled to recover it in an action in assumpsit if the bonds prove to be void for want of power in the corporation to issue them Fernald v Town of Gilman 123 Fed 797 And a purchaser from the person who innocently takes the invalid paper from the munici pality is entitled to recover the money paid by the latter for the bonds Chelsea Savings Bank v City of Ironwood 66 C C A 230 130 Fed 410 Fernald v Town of Gilman supra If a municipal corporation has authority to issue bonds and it does issue bonds which are void for some hidden defect the consideration for the loan thus failing the corporation will be held liable on an im plied contract to repay the purchase price with interest thereon Lou isiana v Wood 102 U S 294 See Read v Plattsmouth 107 U S 568 In such a case the city with legislative authority to borrow is in the market in the capacity of a borrower and receives the money in that char acter even though the transaction assume the form of a sale of its securities Louisiana v Wood supra Hoag v Town of Greenwich 133 N Y 152 30 N E 842 The action by the holders of the bonds against the city is justified under the forms of the common law on the ground that it is an action for money of the plaintiff had and received by the city being money paid upon a consideration which happens to fail or money paid by mistake or money got through imposition See Louis 136RECENT DECISIONS iana v Wood supra and Clark v Board of Commissioners 9 Neb 516 4 N W 246 Where in fact the municipality has received no money for the is sue of the bonds no action by the purchaser or holder of the bonds will lie for there does not exist the foundation for an action to recover a debt owing by the municipality etna Life Insurance Co v Middle port 124 U S 534 Travelers Insurance Co v Mayor of Johnson City 40 C C A 58 99 Fed 663 Parkersburg v Brown 106 U S 487 Again where the city has no statutory authority to purchase certain articles or its agent has no authority to do so or where a contract entered into for services rendered in the construction of improvements is beyond the authorty of the municipality to make the city is not liable for bonds issued for these purposes on the ground that a due regard for the protection of the taxpayers of the municipality demands that the city should be held strictly to its statutory authority in the making of contracts and the expenditure of public funds Floyd County v Allen 137 Ky 575 126 S W 124 J I Case Threshing Machine Co v Common wealth 177 Ky 454 197 S W 940 Thus where a city clerk without authority purchased insect exterminator powder which was used by the city but the body with sale power to bind the city promptly rejected the bill it was held that the city was not liable Worell Manufacturing Co v City of Ashland 159 Ky 656 167 S W 922 The soundness of these decisions is unquestioned but they differ from the instant case in an important particular In the cases cited though the city got the benefit of the materials no funds went into the treasury of the municipality and if it were made liable for the ma terials the treasury would be drawn on without a corresponding amount having gone into it Hence the amount to be paid would not be paid with a corresponding sum previously paid by the plaintiff but with money furnished by the taxpayers In the instant case on the other hand the money had been previously paid into the treasury of the municipality and a recovery is allowed upon the principle of the broad obligation to do justice which rests on all persons natural and artificial See Marsh v Fulton County 10 Wall 676 And the party purchasing the void bonds from the city is entitled to recover the pur chase price paid even though he does not restore or offer to restore the bonds delivered to him Paul v City of Kenosha 22 Wis 266 Con tra City of Ironwood v Wickes 93 App Div 164 87 N Y Supp 554 Where a municipal corporation has legislative authority to issue ne gotiable instruments dependent only upon the adoption of certain pre liminary proceedings such as popular election the bona fide holder has a right to assume that such preliminary proceedings have been regu larly taken if the fact be certified on the face of the instruments or on the face of the bonds from which negotiable coupons are detached by the officers whose duty it is to ascertain it The recital estops the corporation from contesting it as against such holder and the latter is not bound to ascertain the truth or falsity of such recital County of Warren v Marcy 97 U S 96 Commissioners v Bolles 94 U S 104 Town of Coloma v Eaves 92 U S 484 Supervisors of Cumberland County 137138 VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW v Randolph 89 Va 614 16 S E 722 And this principle of estoppel ap plies even though the bonds be nonnegotiable De Voss v City of Richmond 18 Gratt Va 338 The recital in bonds issued by a mu nicipal corporation that they were issued in pursuance of an act of the legislature of the State and ordinances of the city council of said city passed in pursuance thereof does not put a purchaser upon in quiry as to the terms of the ordinance under which the bonds were is sued nor as to the citys compliance with the conditions precedent to an issue of bonds prescribed in the legislative act Evansville v Den nett 161 U S 434 Where a property owner without protest allows the city to make street improvements in accordance with an ordinance passed under the authority of an unconstitutional statute and requir ing that the cost be taxed against the abutting property owners the city cannot enforce payment of assessments levied under the void or dinance City of Henderson v Liebers Executor 175 Ky 15 192 S W 830 And it seems that if collections be made of such assessments the payments can be recovered back See dictum in City of Henderson v Liebers Executor supra The holding in the instant case seems sound upon reason and prin ciple and is supported by the overwhelming weight of modern author ity

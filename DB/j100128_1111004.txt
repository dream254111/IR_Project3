to the benefit conferred The result reached by the Indiana courts therefore seems adequate to safeguard the inter ests of both the general public and of the municipality and to furnish a logical application of the requirement of equivalent benefits in local assessments DISSOLUTION OF JUDIOIAL LIENS UPON EXEMPT PROPERTYThe ex clusive power to determine what property of the bankrupt is exempt under the state laws is vested in the federal courts of bankruptcy In the exercise of this power the courts jurisdiction has often been re garded as limited to the determination of the validity of the claim to exemption and to the segregation of the exempt property2 Neverthe less there has been a distinct tendency to enlarge this jurisdiction along two lines On the one hand by an analogy to cases where the court decides whether the bankrupt has lost his right to an exemption by his fraud3 it is deemed permissible to inquire whether for any other reason the right cannot be exercised and thereby to pass judgment upon conflicting liens and claims4 A similar exercise of jurisdiction on the other hand has been justified upon the ground that the admin istration of exempt property on behalf of those holding waivers of exemption entails no disposition of exempt property since it is not really exempt as to such creditors5 As a result of their varying exercise of jurisdiction over exempt property the lower federal courts are in conflict as to their ability to invoke the operation of  67fS to dissolve as preferences all liens upon exempt property which were acquired within the four months period  2 II Bankruptcy Act Lucius v CawthonColeman Co I905 196 U S I49 McGahan v Anderson C C A I902 113 Fed 115 A state court cannot review the decision of a federal court as to what is an

against a person who is insolvent at any time within four months prior to the filing of a petition in bankruptcy against him shall be deemed null and void in case he is adjudged a bankrupt and the property affected by the levy judgment attachment or other lien shall be deemed wholly discharged    61One view declaring that exempt property passes to the trustee only for identification7 denies that such liens can be set aside as prefer ential on the theory that the language of  67f indicates that it applies only to such property as is transferred to the trustee for administra tion8 In further support of this conclusion it is urged that the sole purpose of this provision is to protect all the other creditors from a preferential transfer obtained by one creditor at the expense of the rest0 No other creditors suffer however since they cannot in any event reach the exempt property and the setting aside of a preference acquired upon exempt property does not benefit them for such prop erty will not thereupon pass into the corpus of the estate to be dis tributed The opposite view proceeds upon the ground that since  67e expressly excepts from its operation exempt property the failure to include a similar exception in  67f clearly indicates that its opera tion was not intended to be limited to property which passes into the bankrupts estate for administration on behalf of the creditors10 This result rests upon the theory that the policy of  67f is not only to secure strict equality among all the creditors but also to protect the bankrupt by giving him a new start with his exempt property free from all liensl The latter view received the sanction of the Supreme Court in the novel case of Chicago Burlington  Quincy B R v Hall 1913 33 Sup Ct Rep 885 The bankrupt sought to obtain his wages which were exempt under the laws of Nebraska where he resided free from liens obtained within four months of the bank ruptcy by judicial proceedings in Iowa where such wages were not exempt The court set aside the liens and ordered the employer of the bankrupt to pay him the wages Since however an exemption is a personal privilege of the bank rupt12 the policy which prohibits depriving him of his exempt prop erty under judicial process without his consent does not equally mili tate against his making a voluntary disposition of such property Thus the Supreme Court in Lockwood v Exchange Bank13 declared that a lien acquired by contract or waiver upon exempt property was not invalid under  67f The distinction between these cases must be found in the policy of the Bankruptcy Act to protect the bankrupt for the language of the Act does not suggest such a difference between voluntary and involuntary disposition of the property The federal courts moreover have repeatedly held that they will aid the holder of a lien acquired after a voluntary waiver of exemptions by staying the See Lockwood v Exchange Bank I903 I90 U S 294 In re Durham D C I9oo I04 Fed 23r

the state courts so that it will not be affected by the discharge14 To consistently observe the distinction indicated by the principal case the court must be prepared to refuse such relief to a creditor who is enforcing a lien obtained without the bankrupts consent A thorough protection of the bankrupts exemption it seems would require the administration by the Bankruptcy Court of all the bankrupts prop erty whether subject to the claims of creditors or exempt CONTINGENT REMAINDERS AS ASSETS IN BANKRUPTCYThe Bank ruptcy Act provides that all property which the bankrupt could by any means have transferred or which might have been levied upon and sold under judicial process against him shall pass to his trustee in bankruptcy The first description practically includes the second2 so that transferability is the broad test of the trustees title and this in turn cannot be reduced to any uniform rule since it depends upon the law of the jurisdiction in which the property is located3 At common law because of their speculative and uncertain char acter contingent remainders were regarded not as estates but mere possibilities4 If the contingency were only as to the happening of an uncertain event the remainderman was said to have a possibility coupled with an interest and he could grant and devise it freely5 But if the uncertainty were as to the persons who should ultimately take as in a devise to the survivors of a class after a life tenancy the right of each of those presumptively entitled was so shadowy that like the interest of an heir apparent in the estate of his ancestor it was considered inalienable6 This proposition was subject to the fol Iit re Hatch D C I900 4 Am Bankr Rep 349 see In re Wells D C 900o 5 Am Bankr Rep 308 In re Brumbaugh D C

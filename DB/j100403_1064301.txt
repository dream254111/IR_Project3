ACCRUED DAMAGES CAN BE RECOVERED WHICH DO NOT IN FACT SO HOLD AMONG THE AUTHORITIES CITED IN THE PRINCIPAL CASE AS SUPPORTING THIS DOCTRINE ONE AT LEAST SEEMS TO HOLD CONTRA HASSEL V NUTT 14 TEX 260 AND IN OTH ERS ALTHOUGH THE COURTS HELD THAT NO DAMAGES COULD BE RECOVERED EX CEPT THOSE ALREADY ACCRUED THE DECISIONS WERE BASED ON LACK OF EVI DENCE OR OTHER GROUNDS THAN THAT PRINCIPLE WHICH THEY WERE CITED TO SUPPORT MEADE V RUTLEDGE 11 TEX 44 WVACO TAP  R CO V SHIRLEY 45 TEX 355 HEARNE V GARNETT 49 TEX 626 IT SEEMS THAT THE WEIGHT OF AUTHORITY AS WELL AS THE BETTER PRINCIPLE SUPPORTS THE DOCTRINE THAT FUTURE DAMAGES FOR THE BREACH ARE RECOVERABLE ALTHOUGH THERE MAY BE DIFFICULTY IN ASSESSING THE DAMAGES AND ALTHOUGH THEY BE UNCERTAIN YET THERE IS CERTAINLY SOME DAMAGE SUFFERED WHICH OUGHT TO BE RECOMPENSED BY THE WRONGDOER AND THE UNCERTAINTY IS NO GREATER THAN IN THE CASE OF DEATH BY WRONGFUL ACT WHICH GIVES THE COURTS NO TROUBLE CUTTER V GILLETTE SUPRA MASTER AND

language libeling the plaintiff After the testators death the will was duly probated The plaintiff brought an action against the testators estate grounded on the libel published in the will Held the action will lie Harris v Nashville Trust Co Tenn 162 S W 584 It seems clear that the publication made by probating the will was a publication by the testator Qui facit per alitrm facit per se Since the right of action did not accrue until after the death of the testator the case presents a very limited field for the operation of the maxim actio personalis moritur cum persona The origin of and reason for this maxim are veiled in obscurity The rule of the ancient common law seemed to be that the death of a party discharged any obligation Bracton fol 101 It seems that it was not until the time of Elizabeth that the maxini was limited in its applica tion and confined to actions ex delicto Finley v Chirney L R 20 Q B 494 The modern doctrine confines it to torts that are not against property Phillips v Homfray L R 24 Ch Div 439 U S v Daniel 6 How U S 11 The rule is one of precedent that cannot be reconciled with the accepted modern legal principles Therefore it seems that it should not be applied in cases of novel impression The denial of a right of action in the principal case would open the door to the publication of false and malicious statements of every kind especially as the wrongdoer in such cases is no longer amenable to the deterrent effects of criminal punishment On the other hand it seems that punitive damages should not be awarded as the penalty inflicted would fall upon the innocent beneficiaries alone But the injured party should be compensated on the principle that wherever a right has been violated the law will afford a remedy Kujeck v Goldman 150 N Y 176 44 N E 773 55 Am St Rep 670 34 L R A 156 It seems that the persons concerned with the actual probate of the will are not liable as they are performing a legal duty and so their acts should be privileged A nisi prius court has held that an action as in the principal case would lie COOLEY TORTS students ed 249 citing Gallaghers Estate 10 Pa Dist Ct 733 MASTER AND SERVANTBREACH OF CONTRACTDAMAGES RECOVERABLEThe plaintiff was employed by the defendant for one year at a fixed compen sation per month After five months the defendant discharged the plain tiff without cause Held the plaintiff has an immediate right of action for the breach of contract but that only such damages as have already accrued at the time of the trial can be recovered Louisiana Rio Grande Canal Co v Quinn Tex 161 S W 375 As a general rule when a servant has been wrongfully discharged he may choose any one of three courses He may treat the contract as rescinded and recover at once on a quantum meruit Fowler v Armour 24 Ala 194 Brinkley v Swicegood 65 N C 626 He may wait until the end of the term and recover the full amount contracted for less any sum which the defendant may have the right to set off Holloway v Talbott 572RECENT DECISIONS 573 70 Ala 389 Such defendant may include in the setoff whatever the plaintiff could have earned if he had made an honest effort to find other work it being against the policy of the law to encourage idleness How ard v Daly 61 N Y 362 He may sue at once for the breach of con tract G A Kelly Plow Co v London Tex 125 S W 974 If the plaintiff adopts the third course it is settled that he may recover the damages which have accrued from the breach up to the date of the trial Blair v Laflin 127 Mass 178 Davis v Dodge 126 App Div 469 110 N Y Supp 787 But as to whether or not he can recover damages for the loss of the future benefit which would have accrued to him un der the contract there is some conflict It has been held that when a servant who has been wrongfully discharged brings his action before the expiration of the contract period he can only recover damages which have accrued at the time of the trial Gordon v Brewster 7 Wis 355 Fowler v Armour supra The courts which hold this view usually assign as a reason that future damages cannot be assessed with sufficient certainty to justify their award The weight of authority however seems to support the doctrine that when the wrongfully discharged servant brings his action before the end of the term he can recover full damages for the breach of contract as well as wages already accrued Cutter v Gil lette 163 Mass 95 39 N E 1010 Inland Steel Co v Harris 49 Ind App 157 95 N E 271 Webb v Depew 152 Mich 698 116 N W 560 Davis v Dodge supra A number of cases are cited as holding that only accrued damages can be recovered which do not in fact so hold Among the authorities cited in the principal case as supporting this doctrine one at least seems to hold contra Hassel v Nutt 14 Tex 260 And in oth ers although the courts held that no damages could be recovered ex cept those already accrued the decisions were based on lack of evi dence or other grounds than that principle which they were cited to support Meade v Rutledge 11 Tex 44 WVaco Tap  R Co v Shirley 45 Tex 355 Hearne v Garnett 49 Tex 626 It seems that the weight of authority as well as the better principle supports the doctrine that future damages for the breach are recoverable although there may be difficulty in assessing the damages and although they be uncertain yet there is certainly some damage suffered which ought to be recompensed by the wrongdoer and the uncertainty is no greater than in the case of death by wrongful act which gives the courts no trouble Cutter v Gillette supra MASTER AND

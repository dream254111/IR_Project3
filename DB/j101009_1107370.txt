6368 IWHEN IS A JUDGMENT SUSTAINING A VERDICT OR SETTING IT ASIDE AS CONTRARY TO THE EVIDENCE PLAINLY WRONG OR WITHOUT EVI DENCE TO SUPPORT IT Section 6363 of the Code of 1919 provides that When a case at law Civil or Criminal is tried by a jury and a party excepts to the judgment or action of the court in granting or refusing to grant a new trial on a motion to set aside the verdict of a jury on the ground that it is con trary to the evidence or when a case at law is decided by a court or judge without the intervention of a jury and a party excepts to the decision on the ground that it is con trary to the evidence and the evidence not the facts is certified the judgment of the trial court shall not be set aside unless it appears from the evidence that such judg ment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it The revisors of the Code in their note to this section state As this section stood before the revision 1 the latter part of it provided that the rule of decision in the appellate court in considering the evidence in the case shall be as on a demurrer to the evidence by the appellant except that when there have been two trials in the lower court in which case the rule of decision shall be for the appellate court to look first to the evidence and proceedings on the first trial and if it discovers that the court erred in setting aside the ver dict on that trial it shall set aside and annul all proceedings subsequent to said verdict and enter judgment thereon Under the present section the judgment of the trial court shall not be set aside unless it appears from the evidence that such judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it The effect of this change is to abolish the rule of decision as on a demurrer to the evidence in such a case and to substitute therefor a much simpler rule 1 Code 1887 sec 3484 as amended by Acts 188990 p 36 and Acts 18912 p 9627 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S While it may be conceded that once having determined the precise effect 2 of the new rule the revisors are probably cor rect in stating that it is simpler than the old yet the ascertain ment of this effect seems not such a very simple matter in view of the language that has been used by the court and by text writers in construing Sec 3484 of the old Code Indeed with these expressions in view it might be plausibly argued that the revised section has effected no change at all in the rule of deci sion in these cases The rule of decision as upon a demurrer to the evidence in deed seemed clear enough viz that the demurrant here the appellant admitted the truth of all his adversarys evidence together with all inferences that might be fairly drawn there from and waived the benefit of all of his own evidence that had been in any manner contradicted or impeached and all infer ences that did not necessarily flow from his unimpeached and uncontradicted evidence and further that if on this view of the evidence a jury might have found for the demurree here the appellee the court must do so However Judge Burks in his authoritative work on Pleading and Practice thus explains the effect of the old rule3 If however the certificate be one of evidence then the 2 In considering the effect of Sec 6363 we are met at the thresh hold by a difficulty or inaccuracy in its wording The phrase a party excepts to the judgment or action in granting or refusing to grant a new trial on a motion to set aside the verdict etc is open to the objection that under Sec 6251 the trial court ordinarily does not grant new trials where it believes the verdict to be contrary to the evidence but sets it aside and enters final judgment on the merits It is believed that the reference to a new trial should probably have been omitted so that the phrase just quoted would read a party ex cepts to the judgment or action of the court    on a motion to set aside the verdict etc As the phrase stands if strictly con strued it would seem to limit the operation of Sec 6363 to the comparatively few cases in which the court would be unable to enter final judgment under Sec 6251 This of course would be contrary to the obvious intent of the revisors and accordingly it has not been so construed and the point seems not to have been raised See P Lorillard Co v Clay Va 104 S E 385 3 BURKs Pt  PR 1st Ed Sec 384 322  Sept1921  RULE OF DECISION IN APPELLATE COURT plaintiff in error goes up as on a demurrer to the evidence and the verdict and the judgment thereon of the trial court will not be disturbed unless it is plainly contrary to the evidence or is without evidence to support it If the evi dence is conflicting on material points the judgment of the trial court sustaining the verdict of the jury will be af firmed Italics supplied This language is almost identical with that used in the new section and similar expressions may be found in many of the cases bearing on this point Thus in Reusens v Lawson4 it is said This court will not under these circumstances set aside the verdict of a jury except where the jury has plainly de cided against the evidence or without evidence although the judges of this court upon the evidence as it is presented to them in the record if they had been on the jury might have rendered a different verdict We cannot under re peated decision of this court set aside the verdict of a jury merely in a doubtful case WXe can only do so where the verdict is a plain deviation upon the evidence from right and justice or where there is a palpable insufficiency of evidence to sustain it Italics Supplied And again in Richmond College v ScottNuckolls Co  In orler to justify a reversal on that ground the verdict must be plainly against the evidence or zithout evidence to support it Italics Supplied It nlight be argued that since such language had been used in these and other cases6 where there could be no question as to the application of the rule of decision as upon a demurrer to the evidence therefore the adoption of similar larnguage in the Code of 1919 adopted witli it the construction with which it had been heretofore used i e as identical with the old rule And in further support of this theory it might be urged that where the judgment is without evidence to support it it would clearly be set aside under the demurrer to the evidence rule as well as under the new section and that where it is plainly wrong or plainly contrary to the evidence the same result would also 4 96 Va 285 293 5 124 Va 333 6 See Pettyjohn v Basham 126 Va 72 and many others 3237 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S ensue under both rules since it might be argued the appellate court cannot say that it is plainly wrong where there is evi dence however slight to support the appellees theory at every mnaterial point the jury being privileged to accept as true any evidence that he may produce no matter how overwhelming the countervailing evidence may be and in cases where evidence was lacking to sustain the appellees theory on any material point the verdict would equally be set aside under the old de murrer to the evidence rule and under the new rule as being without evidence to support it However it is believed that this argument is fallacious The revisors undoubtedly intended to change the rule and it is be lieved that they have done so and further that the change is both material and beneficial And this seems settled by the lan guage of the Supreme Court of Appeals in several recent cases in which however the court has not undertaken to define very precisely the extent and effect of the change Thus Judge Burks in P Lorillard Co v Clay7 Formerly a plaintiff in error stood in this court in the posi tion of a demurrant to the evidence but this has been changed Now in stating a case in this court which has been tried by a jury it must be stated as the jury may have viewed it remembering always that the jury are the sole judges of the weight to be given to the testimony of the witnesses and also bearing in mind the weight attached to the verdict of a jury which has received the approval of the trial judge 8 Italics Supplied To determine the true effect of this change 9 it is well to ask 7 Supra 8 So too in Graham v Cor 127 Va 808 We have under Code 1919 Sec 6363 carefully considered all of the evidence in the case and upon giving the weight to the de cision of the jury upon the matters of fact dependent upon the ev idence which is conflicting and which involves the credibility of wit nesses etc See also U S Fidelity etc Co v Country Club Va 105 S E 686 and other recent cases cited infra 9 In determining the effect of this change we are confined to a discussion based upon the theoretical principles with such light as can be thrown upon them by earlier rulings in this state None of the Codes of other states to which the writer has access contain 324  Sept1921  RULE OF DECISION IN APPELLATE COURT without reference to prior rules When is such a judgment plainly wrong or without evidence to support it To answer this we must go back to the trial court and consider the circum stances under which that court should set aside a verdict as contrary to the evidence It is believed that the language above adverted to as seeming to identify the old rule with the new applies more accurately to the rule which should guide the trial court in these cases than to the former rule of decision in the appellate court with reference to which it was uttered In other words the rule is believed to be that the trial court should not set aside a verdict unless it is plainly contrary to the evi dence or without evidence to support it Furthermore in in terpreting the phrase plainly contrary to the evidence the rule appears to be that the trial court may set aside a verdict which has some slight evidence to support it where this evidence is badly impeached or contradicted by strong and overwhelming ezvidence on the other side To state an extreme case if the jury has rendered a verdict for a party who has produced only one witness and he of slight reputation for veracity and this witness has been directly contradicted by twenty or more repu table witnesses for the losing party that verdict should be set aside1 Yet such a verdict would be sustained if viewed as upon a demurrer to the ezvidence Thus as said in Wadkins v Damascus Lumber Col The position of a plaintiff is more favorable upon a demurrer to the evidence by the defendant than upon a motion to set aside a verdict in his favor It follows then that the trial court had greater freedom in setting similar provisions the judicial construction of which might be con sidered as adopted with the adoption of this section Nor does a limited examination of some of the cases from other iurisdictions reveal any similar statute though the rules arrived at in other states without the aid of statutes appear to be much the same as those believed to be adopted in Virginia by the new Code 4 C J 833 856

court had declined to do so And therefore it might have happened under this procedure that a trial court might err in not setting a verdict aside where the countervailing evidence was overwhelming and yet the appel late court reviewing the evidence as upon a demurrer thereto would have been powerless to reverse the erroneous judgment of the lower court Under the new rule it is believed however that the appellate court stands so to speak in the shoes of the trial court It will examine all of the evidence12 and if in its opinion the trial court should have set aside the verdict dr erred in doing so as the case may be it will reverse the lower court 13 and enter final judgment itself under Sec 6365 However in case of 12 When all bf the evidefce is not certified the appellate court will presume that there was some testimony not set out which justi fied the verdict especially where it is approved by the trial judge Adams v Hays 86 Va 153 9 S E 1019 McArter v Grigsby 84 Va 159 4 S E 369 But the rule was formerly otherwise Indeed it has been repeatedly held that when a bill of exceptions is so indefinite as not to show whether an instruction or evidence was proper of not the judgment should be reversed Brooke v Young 3 Rand 106 McDowell v Crawford 11 Gratt 398 This gave the remarkable result that a plaintiff in error might have any judgment reversed by merely mak ing his bill of exceptions defective as by failing to state all the evidence Old Father Antic the Law This rule of course could not last But after all it is understandable when we remember that in theory the bill of exceptions was made out by the judge Reversal was the penalty for making out a defective bill 13 It is believed that this sets foth the correct interpretation of the section However if this be true a constitutional question at once arises Under Secs 6251 and 6365 when verdicts are set aside in either the lower court or the appellate court final judgment is now usually rendered upon them without any new trial Does this de prive the party whose verdict has been set aside of his constitutional right of trial by jury Formerly the questiojn did not arise for when his verdict was set aside he was given his opportunity at a second trial Under the new section it would seem to arise only when a verdict supported by slight evidence on all material points has been set aside as contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence for if the party who had gained the verdict had failed to bring for 326 r Sept1921  RULE OF DECISION IN APPELLATE COURT doubt the action of the lower court will be sustained for to justify reversal such action must be plainly wrong14 It might seem at first glance that this rule would operate harshly upon an appellant who had won the verdict of the jury in the court below only to have it set aside by the trial court For the requirement that the judgment of the trial court be not reversed unless plainly wrong might appear not to allow suffi cient weight to the verdict of a jury where it had been o3 set aside This objection however is really groundless for when the lower court has disagreed with the jury it will be much easier for the appellate court to say that its judgment is plainly wrong than it will in those cases in which the court has sus tained the verdict of the jury The change upon the whole will be seen to be favorable to the appellant although it is improbable that very many more judgments will be reversed under the new provisions than un der the old For while it is true that under the old rule no mat ter how strong a case the appellant may have made on the trial he could not succeed in his appeal when the appellee had main tained his case by any evidence however slight as to all its ma terial points still today he should not prevail on the lower court to set the verdict aside unless he have an overwhelming preponderance of the evidence or his opponents be lacking on some vital point and failing to have the verdict set aside in the lower court he must have still a stronger case to secure relief would no more deprive him of his right to a jury trial than would a decision against him on a demurrer to a defective pleading The constitutional questions thus raised are however beyond the scope of this article 14 Formerly it was settled that As a general rule a stronger case must be made in order to justify an appellate court in disturbing an order granting a new trial than where a new trial has been refused the reason usually assigned for this rule being that the refusal to grant a new trial operates a final adjudication of the rights of the parties while the granting of a new trial simply invites further in vestigation Vaughn v Mayo Milling Co 127 Va 148 However since the trial judge in setting aside a verdict as a rule no longer grants a new trial but enters such judgment as he deems correct under Sec 6251 this principle would seem to be no longer applicable in the usual case 3277 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S in the appellate court since it will resolve every doubt in favor of the decision of the lower court15 These conclusions will be strengthened it is believed by a brief consideration of the rule of decision in these cases prior to the enactment of the Code of 1887 and an inquiry into the effect of the rule adopted by that Code as amended a few years later upon the classes of cases to which it was applicable The history of the rule was ably sketched by Judge E C Burks in an article in 9 Va Law Journal p 257 and again by the court in Muse v Stern6l just prior to the passage of the Code of 188717 Judge Burks thus lays down the law as it stood at that time his conclusion being based upon cases in which the trial court had refused to disturb the verdict On such review the court will not reverse the judgment unless after rejecting all the oral evidence of the excepting party and giving full force and credit to the evidence of the adverse party the judgment still appears to be wrong The same rule was applicable to criminal cases at this time1 It will be observed that this rule was even more stringent than the demurrer to the evidence rule since under the latter the appellant waived not all of his evidence as under this rule but merely that which had been impeached or contradicted 15 As said in Cardwell v Norfolk etc R Co 114 Va 500 No attempt has been made so far as we are advised by the courts or the law writers to formulate a rule defining the limit to which the trial court or the appellate court may go in reviewing the evidence to ascertain and to determine whether or not a verdict of a jury is plainly against the evidence or without evidence to support it In deed it would be a task difficult if not impossible of performance to prescribe with circumstantial precision the extent to which the trial court or the appellate court may properly examine the evidence with the view of determining whether or not the verdict of the jury thereon should be disturbed 16 82 Va 33 3 Am St Rep 77 17 In England no appeal was allowed in such cases In Virginia it was allowed at first only where the judge certified the facts Later it was settled that if he was unable to certify the facts he might if he chose certify the evidence Finally the rule was established that if he could not certify the facts he might be compelled to certify the evidence See article by Judge Burks cited supra 18 Finchims Case 83 Va 689 328  Sept1921  RULE OF DECISION IN APPELLATE COURT For cases in which the court had disagreed with the jury and set aside the verdict none of which appear to have been decided in the appellate court under a certificate of the evidence at the time of Judge Burks article the court shortly afterwards in Muse v Stern supra laid down the following rule as stated in the reporters syllabus Where evidence is conflicting and involves credibility and the verdict is set aside and the evidence is certified this court will look at the whole evidence and sustain the verdict un less it be against the law or the evidence or without evi dence This rule seems to be substantially that which has been adopted by the new Code for all cases Still a different rule prevailed where the case was submitted to the court without a jury an appeal being taken on the ground that the decision was contrary to the evidence Here despite some difference of opinion it seems that the appellant was re garded as in the position of a demurrant to the evidence 19 the rule later adopted by the Code of 1887 for this and other cases The effect of the enactment of that Code upon the several rules above stated and consequently the change made by the Code of 1919 will be found to vary more or less as applies to 1 Civil or Criminal cases 2 cases tried by a jury or those sub mitted to the judge and 3 cases in which the trial court re fused to set aside the verdict or those in which it granted the motion20 19 Hodges Exor v First Natl Bank 22 Gratt 51 56 9 VA L J 263 20 To a certain extent the rule was affected by the question of whether the burden of proof in the lower court had been upon the appellant or upon the appellee Consider the case in which a ver dict against the party upon whom rested the burden of proof was found by the jury and sustained by the court In such case upon appeal under the Code of 1887 the appellant was regarded as in the position of a demurrant to the evidence despite the fact that in this case he had himself been carrying the burden of proof In any state except Virginia and West Virginia this would be nonsense or another way of stating that there was no appeal in such cases For in all these other jurisdictions the demurrant waives all of his 3297 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S I CIVIL CASES Trial by JuryA civil case in which there has been a trial by jury and verdict approved by the trial judge seems to be the most usual type that arises under the statute And it is to this class that the preceding discussion has been mainly addressed some of it being clearly inapplicable to other classes Here the rule of decision as upon a demurrer to the evidence was simple of application at least where the verdict was in favor of the party carrying the burden of proof and strictly speaking under the statute only the evidence should have been considered Practically however the approval of the trial judge was given great weight in doubtful cases the decisions abound ing in expressions to that effect The new Code appears plainly to allow such weight to be given the trial judges opinion and yet reversal is easier than formerly for as above stated the appellate court will set aside the verdict wherever the trial court should have done so which seems not to have been true in all cases heretofore21 own evidence and hence the party carrying the burden of proof cannot demur to the evidencefor there could be nothing left un waived to which he might demur In Virginia and West Virginia however it is well settled that the demurrant waives only such of his evidence as has been impeached or is in conflict with the de murrees and accordingly it has been held in Virginia that the party on whom rests the burden of proof may demur to the evidence Bonos v Ferries Co 113 Va 495 75 S E 126 Wood v Phillips 117 Va 878 86 S E 101 The result is a sort of inverted demurrer the question being whether the demurrants own evidence is sufficient to support the verdict after waiving all of it that is impeached or is in con flict with the demurrees evidence It will be seen that this places a very onerous burden upon the demurrant yet as applied to ap appeals while the evidence to be examined was somewhat different where the party carrying the burden of proof was the appellant the effect was after all very much the same See Abernathy v Emporia Mfg Co 122 Va 406 21 Recent cases of this type are Norfolk etc R Co v Fentress 127 Va 87 Norfolk etc R Co vz Simmons 127 Va 419 WVashington etc R Co v Warren 124 Va 452

221 Craddock Lumber Co v Tenkins 330  SeptRULE OF DECISION IN APPELLATF COURT But where in a civil case tried by a jury the verdict of the jury was set aside by the trial court and a new trial granted under the old procedure there seemed to be considerable doubt as to the correct rule of decision if the case finally reached the appellate court after the second trial The code as amended distinctly stated that in such case the appellate court should look first to the evidence and proceedings on the first trial and if it discovers that the court erred in setting aside the verdict on that trial it shall set aside and annul all proceedings subse quent to said verdict and enter judgment thereon The ques tion remained however whether in looking at the evidence on the first trial the court should do so as on a demurrer by the appellant thereto The question was considered at some length by Judge Card well in Cardwell v Norfolk etc R Co22 the conclusion being reached that the evidence was not to be considered as upon a demurrer thereto The other judges however though concur ring in the result in that particular case stated that in their opinion it was unnecessary in view of the facts of that case to decide what the rule of decision under Sec 3484 of the Code of 1887 was and whether there was any conflict in the previous cases on that subject and they further said that they did not concur in all that was said in Judge Cardwells opinion as to the rule of decision under that section And in Marshalls Admr v Valley Ry Co23 it is distinctly stated that the case was heard as upon a demurrer to the evidence 124 Va 167 Manor  Others v Hindman 123 Va 767 Lynchburg Traction etc Co v Gordon 123 Va 198 Aetna Ins Co v Aston 123 Va 327 Virginia Ry etc Co v Boltz 122 Va 649 Virginia Portland

Pont Co v Brown Va 105 S E 660 Tucker Sanatorium v Cohen Va 106 S E 355 22 Supra 23 Supra 331 1921 7 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S However in numerous other decisions both before and since these cases it has been flatly stated that where there have been two trials the appellate court in reviewing the evidence on the iirst trial does not regard it as upon a demurrer thereto24 and the same position is taken by Judge Burks in his work on Plead ing and Practice25 It is believed that these cases established the rule that where there had been two trials the appellate court in looking to the proceedings on the first trial would consider all of the evidence of both parties just as the trial court should have done in determining whether the verdict should have been set aside and then giving due weight to the opinion of the trial judge will sustain the verdict unless it was contrary to the evi dence or without evidence to support it This being so it will be seen at once that the rule under the new Code is precisely the same as it was under the old section where there had been two trials26 Case Submitted to JudgeWhen a civil case is submitted to the judge as to matters of both law and fact without the intervention of a jury the rule of decision in case of appeal on the ground that the judgment was contrary to the evidence was by the express terms of the Code under the old procedure the same as in cases of trial by jury i e as upon a demurrer to the evidence by the appellant While in terms the rule was the same here in both cases its effect was more severe upon the losing party where the case had been submitted to the judge For in case of trial by jury as shownabove the lower court might have set aside the verdict where it was plainly contrary to the great weight of the evidence even though the opposing party 24 Palmer v Showalter 126 Va 306 Shiveleys Adm v Norfolk etc R Co 125 Va 384 Carter v Washington etc R Co 122 Va 458 Thompson v Norfolk etc Traction Co 109 Va 733 Citizens Bank v Taylor 104 Va 164 25 BURKS PL  PR lst Ed Sec 384 26 Of course under Sec 6251 there is now ordinarily only one trial in the lower court Recent cases of this class are Commander v Provident Relief Association 126 Va 455 Palmer v Showalter supra Southern Amusement Co v Ferrell 125 Va 429 IShiveleys Adm v Norfolk etc R Co supra Carter v Washington etc R Co supra 332  Sept333 1921  RULE OF DECISION IN APPELLATE COURT had made a case strong enough to stand the test of the demurrer to the evidence rule But where the jury had been waived there was no tribunal clothed with this authority and the appellate court was bound to uphold the lower court if there was any evidence at all supporting it on each material point Thus in effect the decision of a judge in such cases was given greater weight than the verdict of a jury in similar cases since the verdict of the latter might be set aside where it was plainly contrary to the evidence as well as where it was without evi dence to support it while the decision of the judge in a case submitted to him could be reversed on appeal only when with out evidence to support it i e when the evidence was insuf ficient when viewed as upon a demurrer thereto Here the new Code has apparently made a sweeping change It is believed that the appellate court now stands in precisely the same position with regard to reversing such judgments that the lower courts have always stood with regard to setting aside ver dicts of juries They will be set aside where plainly contrary to the evidence Furthermore this implies that they will be set aside more freely than verdicts rendered by juries and sustained by the trial courts under the new procedure Before the trial court can set aside a verdict it must appear that the jury was plainly wrong And before the upper court can reverse the trial court for not setting it aside it must be shown both that the jury was plainly wrong and also that the trial court was plainly wrong in failing to so hold In other words a verdict of a jury might conceivably be plainly zwrong and yet so near the border line that the action of the trial court in refusing to set it aside while wrong would yet not be plainly wrong so as to justify re versal on appeal To show that a verdict was plainly wrong and that a trial court was plainly wrong in not seeing and de claring it to be so requires a very clear case indeed Under the new Code the appellate court now looks at a judgment of the trial court in cases submitted to it in the same light in which the trial court looks at the verdict of a jury and in so doing it would seem not to require so strong ashowing to enable the appellate court to declare that judgment to be plainly wrong as it would7 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S to enable it to declare that a verdict was plainly wrong and the lower court plainly wrong in not setting it aside27 II CRIMINAL CASES In criminal cases the change while apparently precisely the same as in civil cases in which a verdict found by the jury had been approved by the lower court seems to be even more de sirable than in those cases For in criminal cases it must be remembered that the jury should not convict unless convinced of the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt Yet under the old practice if the Commonwealth made a prima facie case by any sort of evidence no matter how feeble the accused upon conviction could have no relief by appeal from the refusal of the trial court to grant him a new trial even though the over whelming weight of the evidence may have been favorable to him The new rule changes this and the appellate court will now set aside the verdict whenever the lower court should have done so And the rule in the lower court is the same in criminal cases as in civil cases i e the verdict will be set aside when plainly contrary to the evidence or without evidence to support it28 It might be thought that in view of the requirement that the jury be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt before rendering a verdict of guilty a stronger case would have to be made out by the Commonwealth in order to justify the lower court in refusing to disturb a verdict of guilty than would be required of the successful party in a civil suit In other words since greater certainty is required for conviction when that degree of certainty does not appear to have been attained the trial court might set the verdict aside even though in its opinion the evidence might have been sufficient to have sustained a ver dict in a civil cause where less certainty is reqliired This how 27 Recent cases of this type are Town of Appalachia v Mainous 126 Va 419 Pettyjohn v Basham supra Hilliard v Union Trust Co 123 Va 724 SmithGordon Co v Snellings Va 107 S E 651 F W Stock  Sons v Owen  Barker Va 105 S E 587 28 Grayson v Cor 6 Gratt 712 Vaiden v Cor 12 Gratt 717 Read v Corn 22 Gratt 924 944 Nicholas v Corn 91 Va 741 21 S E 364 334  Sept1921  RULE OF DECISION IN APPELLATE COURT ever does not appear to be the rule For in Vaiden v Corn29 the following language which seems never to have been over ruled or disapproved was used And in passing upon the case as presented by the evidence we must be governed by the same rules and conform to the same principles which prevail in civil cases In the latter it is true the jury are to weigh the evidence and to decide according to its preponderance while in criminal cases it has been usual for the courts to advise the jury to require clear and satisfactory proof of the guilt of the prisoner before they bring in a verdict of conviction and if they entertain a reasonable doubt of his guilt to give him the benefit of the doubt and bring in a verdict of ac quittal But this is a matter for the guidance of the jury in the performance of their especial and peculiar function of responding to the questions of fact involved and not for the government of the court before which the trial is had in reviewing the action of the jury and still less for that of this court in reviewing the action of that court This court can only inquire whether the verdict is warranted by the evidence before it it certainly cannot enter upon an enquiry whether the jury should not have entertained a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the prisoner and set aside the verdict or suffer it to stand according to the supposed result of such an enquiry From the above statement it will be seen that a prisoner con victed despite a clear preponderance of the evidence in his favor would still have no relief either from the trial court or upon an appeal in case there was sufficient evidence to support the ver dict according to the principles applicable in civil cases30 But under the new Code he will at least be able to secure a new trial 29 Supra 30 See however Williams v Cor Va 107 S E 655 and Hender son v Corn Va 107 S E 700 where the appellate court set aside convictions stating that the evidence iseemed to be at least equally consistent with the theory of innocence as with that of guilt These cases may possibly be considered as overruling Vaiden v Cor supra and establishing the rule that the court will enter upon an enquiry whether the jury should not have entertained a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the prisoner and will set aside the verdict if the evidence appears to be plainly insufficient to extinguish

J100438,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY,1004835,DESCRIPTIONS OF THE SPECIMENS OF INFERIOR MAXILLARY BONES OF MASTODONS IN THE CABINET OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY WITH REMARKS ON THE GENUS TETRACAULODON GODMAN C,I241962,317 ARTICLE IX DESCRIPTIONS OF THE SPECIMENS OF INFERIOR MAXILLARY BONES OF MASTODONS IN THE CABINET OF THE MERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY WVITH REMARKS ON THE GENUS TETRACAULODON GODMAN 4C BY ISAAC LHAYS MD READL MAY 20 1831 MY FRIEND THE LATE DR GODMAN COMMUNICATED TO THE SOCIETY ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS SINCE AN ACCOUNT OF AN EXTINCT FOSSIL ANIMAL CLOSELY RESEMBLING THE MASTODON IN MOST OF ITS CHARACTERS BUT DIFFERINLG FROM IT IN POSSESSING TUSKS IN THE LOWER JAW THIS DIFFERENCE DR GODMAN THOUGHT OF SUFFICIENT IMPORTANCE TO CONSTITUTE A NEW GENUS TO WHICH HE GAVE THE NAME OF TETRACAULODON THE IMMEDIATE SUBJECT OF DR GODMANS DESCRIPTION HAVING BEEN A YOUNG ANIMALT A DISTINGUISHED NATURALIST OF NEW YORK SUGGESTED THE OPINION THAT THE TETRACAULODON WAS NOTHING BUT THE YOUNG OF THE GI GANTIC MASTODON AND THAT THE TUSKS WERE MERELY MILK TEETH WHICH WERE LOST AS THE ANIMAL BECAME ADULT THE SAMNE OPILNION HAS SINCE BEEN CONFIDENTLY ADVANCED BY OTHERS 1 HAD DR GODMAN BEEN ABLE TO EXAMINE THE SPECIMENS IN OUR CABI NETS WITH HIS OWN EYES INSTEAD OF BEING OBLIGED TO RELY UPON THOSE OF OTHERS HIS OWN MEMOIR WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE CONTAINED ALL THE PROOFS NECESSARY FOR REFUTING THE OPINION THAT HE HAD COMMITTED THE ERROR OF  SEE VOL III N S P 478 T DR GODMAN STATES HOWEVER THAT THERE ARE TWO ADULT JAW BONES OF THE SAME ANIMAL IN THE CABINET OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA VOL III N S P 484  WILLIAM COOPER ESQ  SEE SILLIMANS JOURNAL VOL XIX P 159 160 OCTOBER 1330 11 SEE FERUSSACS BULLETIN FOR AUGUST 1830 C VOL IV4 E318 DESCRIPTIONS OF INFERIOR MAXILLARY BONES DESCRIBING AS A IIEW ANIMAL THE YOUNG OF A KNOWN SPECIES THE ACCOUNT OF THE TETRACAULODON WAS HOWEVER WRITTEN BY THE AUTHOR LITERALLY ON HIS DEATH BED THERE IS NO NEED OF THE SOCIETYS BEING REMINDED OF THE GENEROUS AND LOFTY AMBITION BY WHICH DR GODMAN WAS ALWAYS ACTUATED OR THAT HE WAS COMPELLED THROUGH LIFE TO STRUGGLE AGAINST DIFFICULTIES WHICH NO ORDINARY MAN COULD HAVE OVERCOME AND THEY WILL AT ONCE UNDERSTAND HIS EXPRESSION TO HIS FRIENDS ON ANNOUNCING THAT HE WAS PREPARING AN ACCOUNT OF A NEW FOSSIL ANIMAL I HAVE ALL MY LIFE SAID HE  BEEN COMPELLED TO LABOUR FOR BREAD I SHALL NOW DO SOMETHING FOR MY FAME THESE REMARKS WILL ACCOUNT FOR SUCH IMPERFECTIONS AS MAY HAVE OCCURRED IN DR GODMANS MEMOIR AS ALSO EXPLAIN MY ANXIETY TO SECURE TO HIM THE CREDIT WHICH APPEARS TO ME TO BE HIS DUE IT IS NOT MY PURPOSE TO INQUIRE INTO THE VALUE OF THE TUSK IN THE LOWER JAW AS CONSTITUTING A GENERIC DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE MASTODON AND TETRACAULODONT GENERIC DIVISIONS IN SCIENCE ARE FOR THE MOST PART AS YET TOO ARBITRARYTHE CHARACTERS UPON WHICH THEY ARE FOUNDED TOO ILL DETERMINEDANID OUR MATERIALS AT PRESENT TOO SCANTY TO INDUICE US TO VENTURE ANY REMARKS UPON THIS SUBJECT EVEN HAD WE NOT DETER MINED TO RESTRICT OURSELVES TO A DETAIL OF FACTS A MORE IMPORTANT SUBJECT OF INQUIRY IS WHETHER THE TETRACAULODON IS MERELY THE YOUNG OF THE GIGANTIC MASTODON AND THE TUSKS IN ITS LOWER JAW ONLY MILK TEETH WHICH ARE LOST WHEN THE ANIMAL BECOMES ADULT AND ARE NEVER REPLACED FORTUNATELY THE CABINET OF THE SOCIETY FURNISHES US WITH MATERIALS FOR AT ONCE SETTLING THIS QUESTION IT CON TAINS PORTIONS OF THREE LOWER JAWS WHICH I HAVE THE HONOUR OF EXHIBIT ING AND WHICH WILL BE PARTICULARLY DESCRIBED HEREAFTER THE FIRST IS THAT OF A YOUNG MASTODON M GIGANTEUM PLATE XX ENTIRELY DESTITUTE OF TUSKS OR ALVEOLI FOR TUSKS THE TWO OTHERS APPERTAIN TO AGED ADULT ANIMALS PLATES XXVIII AND XXIX AND EXHIBIT DISTINCT SOCKETS FOR TUSKS A MORE COMPLETE REFUTATION THEN OF THE ASSERTION THAT THE TETRA  DR GODMAN DIED BEFORE THE NUMBER CONTAINING HIS MEMOIR WAS PUBLISHED T MR TITIAN R PEALE WHO WAS THE FIRST NATURALIST BY WHOM THE TETRACAULODON WAS SEEN SUGGESTED TO DR GODMAN THAT THE TUSKS IN THE LOWER JAW MIGHT BE MERELY A SEXUAL CHARACTER IT IS IMPOSSIBLE IN THE EXISTING STATE OF OUR KNOWLEDGE AND WITH OUR PRESENT MATERIALS EITHER TO CONFIRM OR POSITIVELY REFUTE THIS SUGGESTIONOF MASTODONS5 WITH REMARKS ETC 319 CAULODON IS ONLY THE YOUNG GIGANTIC MASTODON IS HARDLY POSSIBLE AND THE MERIT OF HAVING CONTRIBUTED TO THE FAUNA OF THIS COUNTRY ONE OF ITS LARGEST ANTEDILUVIAN ANIMALS IS CONFIRMED TO DR GODMAN THE OBJECT WHICH ORIGINALLY PROMPTED THIS COMMUNICATION BEING THUS ACCOMPLISHED I MIGHT HERE CLOSE IT BUT FROM THE GREAT NUMBER OF SPECIMENS WHICH I HAVE BEEN SO FORTUNATE AS TO HAVE HAD OPPOR TUNITIES OF EXAMINING ABOUT FORTY LOWER JAWS AND UPWARDS OF TWO HUNDRED TEETH SOME FACTS HAVE BEEN PRESENTED TO WHICH INY FRIENDS ATTACH SO MUCH INTEREST AS TO INDUCE ME TO LAY AN ACCOUNT OF THEM BE FORE THE SOCIETY THE FIRST SPECIMEN I SHALL DESCRIBE IS A FRAGMENT OF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE LOWER JAW CONSISTING OF THE RAMUS CHIN AND PORTION OF THE CORONOID PROCESS PLATE XX FIG 1 AND Q THIS FRAGMNENT IS SIXTEEN INCHES LONG AND WEIGHS NINE POUNDS THE TEETH AS WELL AS THE LOOSE TEX TURE OF THE BONE SHOW IT TO HAVE BELONGED TO A YOUNG ANIMAL THE CONDYLOID PROCESS AND ANGLE OF THE JAW ARE DEFICIENT AND THE CHIN IS SLIGHTLY BROKEN SO THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT HAD THE FOLIATED TERMINATION SO CONSPICUOUS IN THE ADULT PLATE XXIII S THE CORONOID PROCESS RISES NEARLY PERPENDICULARLY AS IN THE GIGANTEUM BUT THE RAMUS OF THE JAW IS RATHER MORE CYLINDRICAL THAN IN THE ADULT OF THAT SPECIES THIS FRAGMENT CONTAINS TWO TEETH THE POSTERIOR ONE PLATE XX D HAD JUST COMMENCED TO PIERCE THE GUM ITS CROWN IS PERFECT BUT ITS ROOTS ARE NOT YET FORMED THIS TOOTH IS FOUR INCHES AND ONETENTH LONG AND TWO INCHES AND SEVENITENTHS BROAD IT HAS THREE WEDGE SHAPED DENTICULES EACH OF WHICH IS DIVIDED BY A LONGITUDINAL GROOVE INTO TWO PROCESSES THE INNER OF WHICH IS SOMEWHAT THE WIDER AND EACH OF THESE PROCESSES IS SUPERFICIALLY DIVIDED INTO TWO OR MORE POINTS THE EXTERIOR POINTS BEING THE LARGEST THE ANTERIOR TOOTH PLATE XX C RESEMBLES THAT JUST DESCRIBED IN ITS GENERAL CHARACTERS ITS CROWIN IS HOWEVER SOMEWHAT WORN PARTICULARLY ITS ANTERIOR POINTS ITS LENGTH IS THREE INCHES AND THREETENTHS ITS BREADTH IS TWO INCHES AND FIVETENTHS  ALL THE MEASURES WERE TAKEN WITH CALLIPERS320 DESCRIPTIONS OF INFERIOR MAXILLARY BONES ANTERIOR TO THIS TOOTH ARE THREE ALVEOLAR DEPRESSIONS PLATE XX M N O WHICH MARK THE PLACE OF TEETH WHICH HAVE BEEN LOST BENEATH THE ANTERIOR SOCKET IS A FORAMEN FOR THE PASSAGE OF BLOOD VESSELS AND NERVE PLATE XX FIG R AT THE ANTERIOR PORTION OF THE CHIN ARE TWO FORAMINA FOR THE SAME PURPOSE THAT ON THE LEFT SIDE IS LOWER AND LARGER THAN THE OTHER PYRAMIDAL AND AT A SHORT DISTANCE BI FURCATES A FINE NEEDLE MAY BE PASSED SOME DISTANCE INTO EACH OF THESE DIVISIONS IN ONE OF THE LOWER JAWS OF AN ADOLESCENT MASTODON IN THE FINNEL COLLECTION AT NEW YORK THE FORAINEN IN THE CHIN IS TWO LINES IN DIAME TER AND PASSES DIRECTLY INTO THE LARGE FORAMEN IN THE RAMUS OF THE JAW OCCUPIED BY THE MAXILLARY NERVE AND BLOODVESSELS THE NEXT SPECIMEN TO BE NOTICED IS A FRAGMENT OF THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE INFERIOR MAXILLARY BONE OF AN ADOLESCENT GIGANTIC MASTODLON PLATE XXI BELONGING TO THE SPLENDID WISTAR MUSEUM OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA THLIS FRAGMENT IS TWO FEET FIVE INCHES LONG THE GENERAL FORM OF THIS JAW IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE GIGANTIC MASTODON REPRESENTED IN PLATE XXIII BUT THE RAMUS IS RATHER MORE CYLINLDRICAL IN WHICH RESPECT IT RESEMBLES THE SPECIMEN JUST DESCRIBED PLATE XX THE UPPER PORTION OF THE CORONOID AND THE CONDYLOID PROCESSES ARE DE FICIENT AS ALSO THE ANGLE THE CHIN IS ALSO BROKEN BUT THERE ARE MANIFEST INDICATIONS OF AN EXPANSION SIMILAR TO THAT REPRESENTED IN PLATE XXIII S JUST ABOVE THE BASE OF THE RAMUS INITERNALLY ARE A NUMBER OF CIRCULAR DEPRESSIONS PROBABLY FORMED BY THE LOBULES OF THE INFERIOR MAXILLARY GLAND THIS FRAGNMENIT CONTAINS TWO TEETH AND ANTERIOR TO THESE A PORTION OF THE ALVEOLUS OF A THIRD TOOTH THE ANTERIOR TOOTH PLATE XXI E HAS THREE DENTICULES WITH TWO POINTS EACH IT IS FIVE INCHES AND EIGHT TENTHS LONIG AND THREE INCHES AND SEVENTENTHS BROAD THE POSTERIOR TOOTH PLATE XXIF HAS FIVE DENTICULES OR PAIRS OF POINTS AND A TRIFID HEEL THIS TOOTH IS EIGHT INCHES AND ONETENTH LONG AND FOUR INCHES AND THREETENTHS BROAD THE CABINET OF THE SOCIETY DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY SPECIMEN OF THE LOWER JAW PRESENTING ALL THE CHARACTERS OF THE MASTODON GIGANTEUM EXCEPT A SMALL FRAGMENT REPRESENTED IN PLATE XXII THIS FRAGMENT IS TWELVEOF MASTODONS WITH REMARKPC ETC 321 INCHES LONG AND CONSISTS OF A PORTION OF THE RAMUS OF THE JAW WITH THE BASE OF THE CORONOID PROCEQS IT CONTAINS ONE TOOTH THE POSTERIOR MO LAR THIS TOOTH HAS FIVE DENTICULES WITH TWO POINTS EACH AND A HEEL IT IS SIX INCHES AND NINETENTHS LONG AND THREE INCHES AND EIGHTTENTHS BROAD I LHAVE THE PLEASURE HOWEVER OF EXHIBITING TO THE SOCIETY ONE OF THE MOST PERFECT SPECIMENS OF THE LOWER JAW OF THIS SPECIES THAT HAS AS YET BEEN OBTAINED PLATE XXIII THIS JAW BELONGS TO THE BALTI MORE MUSEUM IT IS THE ONE DUG UP BY THE LATE MR PEALE ON THE FARM OF PETER MILLSPAW TWENTY MILES WEST OF THE HUDSON WHICH IS DESCRIBED BY MR REMBRANDT PEALE IN HIS  NARRATIVE OF THE DISCOVERY AND EXHUMATION OF THE SKELETON OF THE MASTODON AND DRAWINGS AND A DESCRIPTION OF WHICH WERE COMMUNICATED BY MR PEALE TO BARON CU VIER AND FROM WHICH THE LATTER DREW MANY OF HIS CHARACTERS OF THIS INTERESTING ANIMAL WHEN FOUND THIS JAW WAS PERFECT BUT ABOUT TWO YEARS SINCE IT WAS UNFORTUNATELY BROKEN BY ACCIDENT THE LARGEST FRAGMENT CONSISTINIG OF THE WHOLE RIGHT SIDE OF THE JAW THE CORONOID AND CONDYLOID PROCESSES THE CHIN AND NEARLY TWO INCHES OF THE LEFT SIDE ALL IN A REMARKABLY FINE STATE OF PRESERVATION ARE REPRESENTED IN PLATE XXIII THE LENGTH OF THIS JAW IS TWO FEET SIX INCHES AND A HALF THE HEIGHT OF THE CORONOID PROCESS ABOVE A LINE DRAWN ALONG THE BASE OF THE JAW FOURTEEN INCHES AND A HALF THE ARTICULATING SURFACE OF THE CONDYLOID PROCESS IS DIVIDED BY A SUPERFICIAL GROOVE X AT ABOUT TWOTHIRDS OF THE DISTANCE FROM ITS INNER EDGE THE DIRECTION OF THE CONDYLE IS INWARDS AND RATHER FORWARDS THE CORONOID PROCESS RISES NEARLY PERPENDICULARLY THE UPPER PART CURVES SOMEWHAT OUTWARDS IT IS ONE INCH AND A HALF HIGHER THAN THE CONDYLOID PROCESS JUST BELOW THE CONDYLE A RIDGE T COMMENCES WHICH AFTER PASSING DOWNWARDS AND A LITTLE FORWARDS A SHORT DISTANCE BECOMES NEARLY HORI ZONTAL AND ABOVE THIS IS A CONSIDERABLE DEPRESSION AN INCH IN DEPTH AT ITS DEEPEST PART THAT PORTION OF THE JAW WHICH IS COVERED BY THE MASSETER MUSCLE IS MUCH FLATTENED AND ROUGH THE ANGLE IS ALSO VERY ROUGH  COPIED IN GODMANS AMERICAN NATURAL HISTORY VOL II P 211 VOL IV4 F322 DESCRIPTIONS OF INFERIOR MAXILLARY BONES THE RAMUS OF THE JAW IS SLIGHTLY FLATTENED ON ITS EXTERNAL ASPECT AND SOMEWHAT EXCAVATED ON ITS INTERNAL ONEI THE ANTERIOR MAXILLARY FORAMINA ARE TWO PLATE XXIII FIG 1 P Q THERE ARE SEVERAL SMALLER FORAMINA NEAR THE CHIN FOR THE PASSAGE OF THE BLOOD VESSELS ANID NERVES THE CHIN TERMINATES IN A REMARKABLE EXPANSION THE EDGES OF WHICH ARE EXCEEDINGLY ROUGH PLATE XXIII 8 THERE ARE NO ALVEOLI FOR TUSKS NOR ANY TRACE OF THERE EVER HAVING BEEN ANY THIS JAW CONTAINED BUT ONE TOOTH IN EACH SIDE THE SOCKETS FOR THE MOLARS ANTERIOR TO THESE ARE COMPLETELY FILLED UP THE TOOTH WHICH RE MAINS THE LAST MOLAR WAS SOMEWHAT INJURED BY THE ACCIDENT TO WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY REFERRED BUT IT APPEARS TO HAVE HAD TEN POINTS AND A HEEL THE DIRECTION OF THIS TOOTH IN THE JAW IS OUTWARD ANTERIORLY AS IS SEEN FROM FIG 2 THE FORAMEN FOR THE INFERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE AND BLOOD VESSELS IS JUST BELOW THE CONDYLE INTERNALLY FIG 2 Y AND IS ONE INCH AND A QUAR TER IN DIAMETER ON THE UPPER SURFACE OF THE RAMUS JUST AT THE BASE OF THE CORONOID PROCESS IS THE COMMENCEMENT OF A SMALL GROOVE WHICH IMMEDIATELY DIVIDES AND DIVERGES IT IS EVIDENTLY CAUSED BY A BLOOD VESSEL AND WE MENTION IT BECAUSE A SIMILAR GROOVE OCCURS IN THE FRAGMENT REPRE SENTED IN PLATE XXII IT IS NOT TO BE FOUND IN ANY OTHER SPECIMEN IN THE COLLECTION  THE LOWER JAW REPRESENTED IN PLATE XXIV DIFFERS CONSIDERABLY IN ITS FORM FROM THE JAWS OF THE M GIGANTEUM WE HAVE DESCRIBED ITS BASE IS MORE CURVED ANTEROPOSTERIORLYTHE EXTERNAL ASPECT OF ITS RAMUS IS MORE FLATTENED AND THAT PORTION OF THE JAW COVERED BY THE MASSETER MUSCLE LESS SO THE GROOVE FOR THE TONGUE IS DEEPER AND NARROWER AND THE CHIN APPEARS POINTED BUT THE SPECIMEN BEING PARTLY WORN IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE EXACT FORM OF THIS PART  THERE IS IN THE CABINET OF THE LYCEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY OF NEW YORK A FRAGMENT OF AN INFERIOR MAXILLARY BONE WHICH AGREES IN ALL ITS CHARACTERS WITH THAT JUST DESCRIBED EXCEPT THAT THE DIRECTION OF ITS CONDYLE IS INWARDS AND BACKWARDS AND THAT ITS POSTERIOR MOLAR HAS BUT FOUR DENTICULES THIS BONE WAS FOUND IN NEW JERSEY AND IS FIGURED IN MITCHELLS EDITION OF CUVIERS THEORY OF THE EARTH AND COPIED INTO CUVIERS OSSEMENS FO33ILE39 GRAND MASTO DONTE PLATE III FIG 5OF MASTODONS WITH REMARKSX ETC 323 THE POSTERIOR MOLAR PLATE XXIV F HAS BUT EIGHT POINTS AND THE HEEL IS BROAD WHILST IN OUR SPECIMENS OF THE M GIGANTEUM THE POSTERIOR MOLAR HAS TEN POINTS AND A MAMMILLAFORM HEEL THE DIRECTION OF THE TEETH IS ALSO VERY DIVERGENT ANTERIORLY ARE THESE DIFFERENCES SUFFICI ENT TO INDICATE ITS BELONGING TO A DIFFERENT SPECIES FROM THE M GIGANW TEUM  THERE IS IN THE CABINET OF THE SOCIETY A PORTION OF ANOTHER JAW CONSISTING OF THE LEFT RAMUS CONTAINING TWO TEETH AND THE CHIN WHICH IS ENTIRELY SIMILAR TO THE ABOVE IN ITS CHARACTERS BUT SOMEWHAT DIS TORTED NO DOUBT FROM INJURY WHEN THE ANIMAL WAS YOUNG THERE IS ANOTHER SPECIMEN RESEMBLING THE ABOVE IN ITS GENERAL CHARACTERS AMONG THE LOWER JAW BONES OF MASTODONS BELONGING TO J P WETHERILL ESQ AND WHICH ARE DEPOSITED IN THE VALUABLE CABINET OF THE ACADEMY OF NATU RAL SCIENCES OF THIS CITY THIS FRAGMENT HOWEVER HAS HAD THE TEETH BROKEN OUT THE CABINET OF OUR SOCIETY CONTAINS A PORTION OF AN INFERIOR MAX ILLARY BONE PLATE XXV WHICH DIFFERS IN ITS FORM FROM ANY OF THOSE HITHERTO DESCRIBED THIS FRAGMENT CONSISTS OF THE CHIN THE RIGHT RAMUS WITH THE POSTERIOR MOLARES AND A PORTION OF THE LEFT RAMUS THE ANTERIOR MOLAR PLATE XXV E HAS THREE DENTICULES WITH TWO POINTS EACH THE POSTERIOR FIG F HAS FOUR DENTICULES WITH TWO POINTS EACH AND A RIDGE POSTERIORLY LTHE RAMUS OF THIS JAW IS STRAIGHTER AND MORE CYLINDRICAL THE HEIGHT FROM THE BASE TO THE EDGE OF THE AL VEOLE IS LESS THE GROOVE FOR THE TONGUE BROADER AND SHALLOWER AND THE DIRECTION OF THE TEETH LESS DIVERGING THAN IN THE MAXILLA FIGURED IN PLATE XXIV THE CROWNS OF THE TEETH ARE ALSO LESS ELEVATED IN THE FORMER THAN IN THE LATTER IN THE COLLECTION DEPOSITED BY MR WETHERILL IN THE CABINET OF THE ACADEMY OF NATURAL SCIENCES THERE IS A FRAGMENT OF A LOWER JAW WHICH EXHIBITS THE SAME CHARACTERS AS THE ONE JUST DESCRIBED THIS FRAGMENT CONSISTS OF THE CHIN ABOUT EIGHT INCHES OF THE LEFT AND TWELVE INCHES OF THE RIGHT RAMUS THE ALVEOLAR PROCESSES ARE MUCH BROKEN AND THE TEETH ARE LOST  THIS JAW WAS EXHIBITED TO THE SOCIETY324 DESCRIPTIONS OF INFERIOR MAXILLARY BONES THE INFERIOR MAXILLARY BONE DESCRIBED BY DR GODMAN IS VERY ACCURATELY REPRESENTED IN PLATE XXVI FIG 1 AND 2 THE CHIN THE RIGHT RAMUS AND A PORTION OF THE CORONOID PROCESS AND ABOUT THREEFOURTHS OF THE LEFT RAMUS ARE PERFECT THE MENTAL RIDGE EACH SIDE OF THE LABIAL GROOVE IS SHARP AND SMOOTH WITHOUT THAT REMARKABLE FOLIATED EXPANSION SO CONSPICUOUS IN THE M1 GIGANTEUM PLATE XXIII S IN THE LEFT RAMUS THERE IS STILL THE FIRST DECIDUOUS TOOTH PLATE XXVI FIG 2 A ON THE RIGHT SIDE THE CORRESPONDING TOOTH HAS FALLEN OUT AND ITS SOCKET IS PARTLY OBLITER ATED THIS TOOTH FIG 2 IS ONE INCH AND FIVETENTHS LONG AND ONE INCH AND ONETWENTIETH BROAD ITS SURFACE IS CONSIDERABLY WORN MOST SO AN TERIORLY IT HAD FOUR POINTS ANTERIORLY THERE IS A FOLD OF ENAMEL WHICH COMMENCING AT THE EXTERNAL EDGE OF THE BASE OF THE CROWN AND PASSING UPWARDS AND INWARDS TERMINATES IN A POINT POSTERIORLY THERE IS A SOME WHAT SIMILAR AND RATHER BROADER FOLD OF ENAMEL ANTERIORLY THE CROWN IS ROUNDED POSTERIORLY IT IS FLATTENED FROM CONTACT WITH ITS SUCCESSOR ITS GRINDING SURFACE IS CONSIDERABLYWORN IT HAS TWO ROOTS ONE ANTE RIOR THE OTHER POSTERIOR WE HAVE SEEN IN THE CABINET OF WILLIAM COOPER ESQ OF NEW YORK A FRAGMENT OF A LOWER JAW CONTAINING ONIE OF THESE TEETH EXCEEDINGLY PERFECT ITS POINTS ARE SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLY WORN ANOTHER SPECIMEN IS IN THE CABINET OF THE ACADEMY OF NATURAL SCIENCEST THE SECOND TOOTH PLATE XXVI C IS ONE INCH AND EIGHTTENTHS LONG AND ONE INCH AND ELEVENTWENTIETHS BROAD THIS TOOTH LIKE THE PRECED ING HAD TWO DENTICULES WITH TWO POINTS EACH ON THE ANTERIOR OF THE CROWN THERE IS A FLAT FOLD OF ENAMEL SIMILAR TO THAT ON THE FIRST TOOTH THIS TOOTH HAS ALSO A HEEL WHICH RISES HIGHEST TOWARDS ITS INNER ASPECT FORMING A SMIALL FIFTH POINT THE GRINDING SURFACE OF THIS TOOTH IS CONSIDERABLY WORN THIS TOOTH LIKE THE PRECEDING ONE HAS TWO ROOTS ONE ANTERIOR THE OTHER POSTERIOR IN THE FINNEL COLLECTION THERE IS ONE OF THESE TEETH IT IS ONE INCH AND SEVENTENTHS LONG AND ONE INCH AND FIVETENTHS WIDE  VOL III P 478 T THIS TOOTH IS DESCRIBED IN THE  FAUNA AMERICANA AS APPERTAINING TO A NEW SPECIES OF TAPIR TO WHICH THE NAME T MASTODONTOIDEUS IS GIVEN MR WILLIAM COOPER WAS WE BELIEVE THE FIRST TO DETECT THIS ERROR WE HAVE CAREFULLY EXAMINED THE TOOTH AND THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT OF ITS BEING THE FIRST MILK TOOTH OF THE ANIMAL WE ARE DESCRIBINGOF MASTODONS WITH REMARKS ETC 325 THE THIRD TOOTH PLATE XXVI C IS THREE INCHES AND ONETENTH LONG AND TWO INCHES AND TWOTENTHS BROAD THIS TOOTH HAS THREE DENTICULES WITH TWO POINTS EACH ON THE ANTERIOR SURFACE OF THE CROWN IT HAS A FOLD OF ENAMEL RISING UIP IN A SMALL POINT AIND ALONG THE BASE OF THE CROWN POSTERIORLY THERE IS AN HORIZONTAL RIDGE CONSISTING OF A NUMBER OF VERY SMALL MAMINILLAFORM PROCESSES THIS TOOTH HAS THREE ROOTS COR RESPONDING TO ITS DENTICULES THE FOURTH TOOTH I IS THREE INCHES AND SEVENTENTHS LONGAND TWO INCHES AND EIGHTTENTHS BROAD IT HAS THREE DENTICULES EACH OF WHICH IS DIVIDED BY A DEEP GROOVE INTO TWO RATHER FLATTENED POINTS OF WHICH THE INNER IS THE BROADER EACH OF THESE IS AGAIN SUPERFICIALLY DIVIDED BY A SLIGHT GROOVE AT THE BASE OF THE CROWN BOTH ANTERIORLY AND POSTERIORLY THERE IS A RIDGE OF VERY SMALL MAMMILLAFORM POINTS EACH DENTICULE HAS ON ITS EXTERNAL POINTBOTH ON ITS ANTERIOR AND POSTERIOR SUR FACE A RIDGE OF ENAMEL WHICH COMMENCES AT THE BASE OF THE PROCESS NEAR THE CENTRAL GROOVE AND PASSES UPWARDS AND OUTWARDS THIS RIDGE APPEARS TO EXIST ON ALL THE TEETH UNTIL IT IS WORN DOWN BY USE AND WE FIND TRACES OF IT ALSO IN THE TEETH OF THE M GIGANTEUM THE CROWNS OF ALL THE TEETH RISE ON THEIR INNER SURFACE NEARLY PERPENDICULARLY BUT ON THE OUTER SIDE THEY SLOPE OBLIQUELY INWARDS THE TUSK BELONGING TO THIS JAW IS SO ACCURATELY DESCRIBED BY DR GOD MANI ANID SO CORRECTLY REPRESENTED IN THE PLATE TO HIS PAPER THAT THERE IS NO NECESSITY FOR MY DOING MORE THAN TO REFER TO IT SEE VOL III N S PLATE XVIII FIG P2 THE TUSK REPRESENTED IN PLATE XXVI FIG 3 IS THAT OF AN ADULT ANI MAL IT IS ELEVEN INCHES LONG AND ITS LARGEST DIAMETER IS TWO INCHES ITS SECTION IS OVAL THIS TUSK CONSISTS OF A CENTRAL COLUMN COMPOSED OF THIN PLATES NEARLY PARALLEL TO ITS BASE THE WHOLE COVERED WITH A COAT OF ENAMEL WHICH BECOMES VERY THICK TOWARDS ITS PROJECTING EXTREMITY THE ENAMEL IS EINTIRELY WORN OFF TO THE TERMINATION OF THIS TUSK AND EVEN THE CENTRAL BONY COLUMN IS EVIDENTLY WORN DOWN AND SMOOTH AS IF FROM USE BY THE ANIMAL IT IS ALSO WORN AT ONE SIDE THIS TUSK BELONGS TO THE COLLECTION OF J P WETHERILL ESQ  THERE IS IN THE CABINET OF THE ACADEMY OF NATURAL SCIENCES DEPOSITED BY MR J FISHER BY WHOM IT WAS OBTAINED AT BIGBONE LICK A TUSK MUCH SMALLER THAN THE ONE WE HAVE DE SCRIBEDIT IS ALSO MUCH LESS PERFECT VOL IV4 G326 DESCRIPTIONS OF INFERIOR MAXILLARY BONES THE NEXT SPECIMEN WE SHALL DESCRIBE IS THE RIGHT SIDE OF AN INFERIOR MAXILLARY BONE IN A REMARKABLY PERFECT STATE OF PRESERVATION BELONGING TO THE CABINET OF THE SOCIETY PLATE XXVIII THE CONDYLOID PROCESS IN THIS JAW IS CONSIDERABLY HIGHER THAN IN THE M GIGANTEUM PLATE XXIII THE DIRECTION OF THE CONDYLE ALSO DIF FERS BEING INWARDS AND BACKWARDS THE CORONOID PROCESS APPEARS TO HAVE RISEN NEARLY PERPENDICULARLY BUT ITS ANTERIOR EDGE AND TERMINATION ARE BROKEN THE SEMILUNAR NOTCH WAS EVIDENTLY DEEPER IN THIS THAN IN THE M GIGANTEUM THOUGH ITS EXACT FORM CANNOT BE DETERMINED IN ITS PRESENT INJURED CONDITION THE POSTERIOR ANGLE IS MUCH ROUNDER THAN IN THE M GIGANTEUM THE OUTER SURFACE WHERE THE TEMPORAL MUSCLE WAS INSERTED IS VERY ROUGH BEING OVER A CONSIDERABLE SPACE QUITE TUBERCULATED AND THERE IS A DISTINCT SEMICIRCULAR RIDGE OF THESE ROUGH ELEVATIONS AS WILL BE SEEN ON REFERENCE TO THE DRAWING PLATE XXVIII FIG 1 T T T IM MEDIATELY ANTERIOR TO THIS SEMICIRCULAR RIDGE THERE IS AN EXCAVATION DISTINCTLY STRIATED WITH MUSCULAR IMPRESSIONS A THE RAMUS IS REMARKABLY CYLINDRICAL AND ITS BASE MUCH MORE CURVED THAN THAT OF THE MI GIGANTEUM PLATE XXIII THE ANTERIOR MENTAL FORAMEN Q IS SMALLER AND NEARER TO THE UPPER EDGE OF THE JAW THAN IN THE OTHER SPECIMENS AND THE POSTERIOR MENTAL FORAMEN IS LARGER THAN IN ANY OF THE SPECIMENS HITHERTO DESCRIBED ITS LARGEST DIAMETER BEING NEARLY NINETENTHS OF AN INCH THE RIDGE AT THE SIDE OF THE LABIAL GROOVE IS BROKEN BUT IT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN EXPANDED WHETHER OR NOT AS IN THE M GIGANTEUIN AND WITH IRREGULAR TERMINATIONS IT IS OF COURSE IMPOSSIBLE TO DIVINE THIS SPECIMEN CONTAINS BUT A SINGLE TOOTH THIS TOOTH IS SIX INCHES LONG AND THREE INCHES AND FOURTENTHS BROAD IT HAS FOUR DENTI CULES WITH TWO POINTS EACH THE ENAMEL ON THE POSTERIOR FACE OF THE CROWN IS BROKEN OFF AND THE CHARACTERS OF THE HEEL CANNOT CONSE QUENTLY BE DETERMINED THE GRINDING SURFACE OF THE CROWN IS SOME WHAT WORN AND PRESENTS THE SAME ARRANGEMENT OF ENAMEL AS IN THE MA GIGANTEUM IN THE CHIN THERE IS A SMALL PART OF THE ALVEOLE OF THE TUSK REMAINING THE DIRECTION OF THIS ALVEOLE IS OUTWARDS AND CONSIDERABLY DOWNWARDS IT HAS BEEN FOUND IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE A GOOD VIEW OF THIS ALVEOLE IN THE PLATE BUT ITS POSITION IS MARKED BY THE DOTTED LINES REPRESENTING A TUSKOF MASTODONS WITH REMARKS ETC 327 IN THE CABINET OF THE SOCIETY THERE IS ANOTHER FRAGMENT OF A LOWER JAW BUT OF THE LEFT SIDE IN ALL RESPECTS SIMILAR TO THE PRECEDING THOUGH MUCH LESS PERFECT THE UPPER PARTS OF BOTH THE CONDYLOID AND CORO NOID PROCESSES ARE DEFICIENT BUT THE ANTERIOR EDGE OF THE LATTER IS MORE PERFECT THAN IN THE PRECEDING SPECIMEN AND RISES NEARLY PERPENDICULARLY FROM THE RAMUS THE CHIN IN THIS SPECIMEN IS ENTIRELY DEFICIENT AS IS ALSO THE WHOLE OF THE INNER TABLE OF THE RAMUS SO THAT THE MNAXILLARY CANAL IS LAID ENTIRELY OPEN THIS BONE MUST HAVE BELONGED TO AN ANIMAL NEARLY OF THE SAME AGE AS THE PRECEDING OR PERHAPS SOMEWHAT YOUNGER THE LAST MOLAR AS IS SEEN FROM THE ALVEOLE FOR THE TOOTH IS WANTING NOT HAVING AD VANCED BY UPWARDS OF AN INCH AS FAR FORWARD AS THAT IN THE FORMER JAW WHETHER OR NOT THE SPECIMEN DESCRIBED BY DR GODMAN AND THE JAWS LAST NOTICED BELONG TO THE SAME SPECIES CANNOT BE DETERMINED POSITIVELY WITHOUT FURTHER SPECIMENS THE JAW NEXT TO BE DESCRIBED HOWEVER EXHIBITS DIFFERENCES WHICH WOULD JUSTIFY THE SUSPICION THAT IT IS SPE CIFICALLY DIFFERENT FROM EITHER THIS SPECIMEN IS REPRESENTED IN PLATE XXIX IT CONSISTS OF A PORTION OF THE RIGHT RAMUS OF THE LOWER JAW TWENTYTWO INCHES AND A HALF LONG IT CONTAINS A SINGLE TOOTH THE POSTERIOR MOLAR TRHE EXTERIOR ASPECT OF THIS JAW AT ITS ANGLE IS ENTIRELY SMOOTH WITHOUT ANY OF THE RUGOSITIES PRESENTED IN THE TWO PRECEDING SPECIMENS BE TWEEN THE POSTERIOR MOLAR AND THE CORONOID PROCESS THERE IS A LARGE SMOOTH EXCAVATION X THE RAMUS OF THIS JAW IS MUCH LESS CYLIN DRICAL THAN THAT OF THE SPECIES FIGURED IN PLATE XXVIII IT IS MUCH FLATTENED ON ITS EXTERIOR ASPECT AND ITS BASE IS ALMOST STRAIGHT THE POSTERIOR MENTAL FORAMEN IS EXCEEDINGLY LARGE UPWARDS OF ONE INCH AND A QUARTER IN DIAMETER THE POSTERIOR MOLAR IS SEVEN INCHES AND TWO TENTHS LONG AND FOUR INCHES AND ONETENTH WIDE IT HAS EIGHT POINTS AND A BROAD HEEL CONSISTING OF A ROW OF SMALL MAMMILLA FOUR OF WHICH ON THE INSIDE ARE VERY DISTINCT THIS TOOTH DIFFERS IN VARIOUS PARTICULARS FROM THE POSTERIOR MOLAR BELONGING TO THE SPECIMEN FIGURED IN PLATE XXVIII IT IS ONE INCH AND A BALF LONGER AND SEVENTENTHS OF AN INCH WIDER THE DENTICULES ARE HIGHER AND THE INNER POINTS MUCH HIGHER ABOVE THE EX TERIOR ONES THUS IN THE FORMER THE SECOND DENTICULE PLATE XXVIII V RISES ONE INCH AIND EIGHTTENTHS FROM ITS ROOT AND THE INNER ONE TWO INCHES AND TWOTENTHS WHILST IN THE LATTER PLATE XXIX V THE CORRESPONDING328 DESCRIPTIONS OF INFERIOR MAXILLARY BONES EXTERIOR POINT RISES TWO INCHES AND THREETENTHS FROM THE ROOT AND THE INNER ONE THREE INCHES AND THREETENTHS MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN THE FORMER OF HALF AN INCH AND IN THE LATTER OF ONE INCH AND ONETENTH THE CHIN IN THIS SPECIMEN CONTAINS ABOUT ONE HALF OF THE ALVEOLE FOR THE EXSERTED TUSK FIG 2 Z THIS ALVEOLE IS RATHER MORE THANI TWO INCHES IN DIAMETER ITS DIRECTION IS OUTWARDS AND DOWNWARDS LESS DOWNWARDS HOWEVER THAN IN THE PRECEDING SPECIES INDEED THERE IS A DISTINCT DIFFERENCE IN THE POSITION OF THESE SOCKETS IN THE TWO SPECIMENS THE BASE OF THE SOCKET IS SMOOTH AND FLAT AND ITS POSITION SOMEWHAT OBLIQUIE SO THAT IT IS RATHER DEEPER TOWARDS THE EXTERIOR THAN TOWARDS THE INTERIOR IT IS PERFORATED BY TWO SMALL FORAMINA FOR THE NUTRIENT ARTERIES AND THE NERVES OF THE TUSK IT IS TO BE LAMENTED THAT LITTLE POSITIVE CAN BE ASCERTAINED AS TO THE LOCALITIES IN WHICH THE BONES BELONGING TO THE SOCIETY AND WHICH WE HAVE JUST DESCRIBED WERE FOUIND THEIR POSITION IN THE SOIL C ALL THAT CAN BE COLLECTED IS THE PROBABILITY THAT THEY ARE FROM THE BIGBONE LICK AND THAT THEY ARE THOSE PRESENTED BY OUR LATE PRESIDENT THOMAS JEFFERSON ESQ AND WHICH ARE NOTICED IN THE COMMUNICATION OF PROFESSOR WISTAR IN VOL I N S P 376 OF THE TRANSACTIONS DENTITION OF THE MASTODON THE SPECIMENS WE HAVE JUST DESCRIBED FURNISH SOME INTERESTING IN FORMATION RELATIVE TO THE DENTITION OF THE MASTO8LON WHICH WE SHALL NOW PROCEED TO LAY BEFORE THE SOCIETY THE FORM ANID DIFFERENCES SUCCESSION AND NUNMBER OF THE TEETH ARE ALL SUBJECTS OF GREAT INTEREST ALND IN DESCRIB ING THEM WE SHALL FOLLOW CUVIER ADDING SUCH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AS OUR INVESTIGATIONS HAVE BROUGHT TO LIGHT THE CROWN OF THE TEETH MORE OR LESS APPROACHES THE RECTANGULAR FORM SLIGHTLY INCLINED HOWEVER TO RHOMBOIDAL AND RATHER NARROWER ANTERIORLY THAN POSTERIORLY IT CONSISTS OF TWO SUBSTANCES THE INTERIOR OSSEOUS THE EXTERIOR ENAMEL THE CROWII IS DIVIDED BY DEEP FURROWS INTO A NUM BER OF RIDGES OR DENTICULES AND THESE DENTICULES ARE SUBDIVIDED BY ONE OR MORE SUPERFICIAL AND NARROW PROCESSES OR TUBERCLES THE OUTER FACE OF THE CROWN RISES NEARLY PERPENDICULARLY THE INNER FACE RISES OB LIQUELY INWARDS IN THE LOWER JAW THE OUTER POINT IS HIGHER THAN THEOF MASTODONS WITH REMARKS ETC 329 INNER IN THE UPPER JAW IT IS THE REVERSE AS THE TEETH ARE USED THEIR POINTS BECOME WORN DOWN AND THE ENAMEL PRESENTS A LOZENGE FORM WITH BONE IN THE CENTRE THE ROOTS OF THE TEETH ARE FORMED AFTER THE CROWN WITH THE REMAINS OF THE ANIMAL DESCRIBED BY DR GODMAN THERE WERE FOUND A NUMBER OF POINTS EVIDENTLY PARTS OF VERY YOUNG TEETH OF WHICH THE BODIES BY WHICH THEY WERE TO HAVE BEEN CONNECTED TOGETHER HAD NOT YET BEEN FORMED THESE POINTS ARE NOW IN THE MUSEUM OF MR RUBENS PEALE NEW YORK THE NUMBER OF THE ROOTS MAY BE SAID TO CORRESPOND TO THE NUMBER OF THE DENTICULES IN THE TEETH WITH TWO DENTICULES THE TWO ROOTS ARE DISTINCT IN THOSE WITH MORE THAN TWO DENTICULES THE ANTERIOR AND SOME TIMES THE SECOND ROOT ARE DISTINCT THE OTHERS ARE UNITED BUT MARKED BY DISTINCT GROOVES THE ROOTS ARE FLATTENED ANTERIORLY AND POSTERIORLY EXTERNALLY THEY ARE SLIGHTLY AND INTERNALLY DEEPLY GROOVED THE UPPER TEETH MAY BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THOSE OF THE LOWER JAW BY THEIR ROOTS BEING MORE DIVERGENT LATERALLY AND BY THEIR CROWNS BEING BROADER THE TEETH DIFFER FROM ONE ANOTHER PRINCIPALLY IN THEIR SIZE AND IN THE NUMBER OF THEIR DENTICULES IN THE SPECIES OF MASTODON WHICH INHABITED THIS COUNTRY THERE ARE THREE KINDS OF TEETH THE FIRST NEARLY SQUARE AND HAVINIG TWO DENTICULES THE SECOND RECTANGULAR WITH THREE DENTICULES THE THIRD LONGER GENERALLY CONTRACTED POSTERIORLY AND HAVING FOUR OR FIVE DENTICULES AND A HEEL OF VARIOUS FORMS THE FIRST MENTIONED TEETH ARE ALWAYS ANTERIOR NEXT FOLLOW THOSE WITH THREE DENTICULES AND LASTLY THOSE WITH FOUR AND FIVE DENTICULES BUT WE HAVE NEVER SEEN THOSE WITH FIVE DISTINCT DENTICULES IN THE UPPER JAW THEY APPEAR TO BELONG EXCLUSIVELY TO THE LOWER IN THE YOUNG JAW DESCRIBED BY DR GODMAN WE FIND 1ST A SMALL SQUARE TOOTH WITH TWO DENTICULES 9D ONE RECTANGULAR WITH TWO DEN TICULES 3D A TOOTH WITH THREE DENTICULES 4TH ONE RATHER LARGER ALSO WITH THREE DENTICULES IN THE UPPER JAW THERE ARE CORRESPONDING TEETH EACH OF THE TWO ADULT LOWER JAWS HAVING TUSKS PLATES XXVIII AND XXIX CONTAINS A TOOTH WITH EIGHT POINTS AND IT IS MANIFEST THAT THERE WAS A CORRESPONDING TOOTH IN THE UPPER JAW THE WHOLE NUMBER OF TEETH POSSESSED BY THE ANIMAL DESCRIBED BY DR GODMAN TETRACAULO DON IS THEN AT LEAST TWENTY AND WE THINK THAT IT IS AT LEAST PROBABLE VOL IV4 H330 DESCRIPTIONS OF INFERIOR MAXILLARY BONES THAT THE ANIMAL POSSESSED AN INTERMEDIATE TOOTH BETWEEN THE SECOND TOOTH WITH THREE DENTICULES PLATE XXVI D AND THAT WITH FOUR DENTI CULES PLATE XXIX F FOR WE CANNOT BELIEVE THE FORMER TOOTH COR RESPONDS WITH THAT REPRESENTED IN PLATE XXVII E SHOULD WE BE CORRECT IN OUR VIEWS THIS ANIMAL POSSESSED THREE TEETH WITH THREE DEN TICULES IN EACH SIDE OF EACH JAW MAKING THE WHOLE NUMBER OF TEETH TWENTYFOUR BUT TO RENDER THIS CERTAIN WOULD REQUIRE SPECIMENS OF INTERMEDIATE AGES TO THOSE HITHERTO DESCRIBED CUVIER ATTRIBUTES TO THE GIGANTIC MASTODON BUT SIXTEEN TEETH EIGHT IN EACH JAW OF THESE TEETH HE SAW THE THREE POSTERIOR ONLY OF EACH SIDE  BUT HE INDICATES THE FOURTH FROM AN ALVEOLE IN THE YOUNG SPECIMEN PRE SENTED TO THE FRENCH MUSEUM BY MR JEFFERSON AND HE ASKS WHETHER THIS TOOTH HAD TWO OR THREE DENTICULES IN THE YOUNG SPECIMEN BELONG ING TO THE CABINET OF OUR SOCIETY THERE ARE TWO TEETH WITH THREE DENTICULES EACH AND ANTERIORLY AN ALVEOLE WITH THREE DEPRESSIONS PLATE XX FIG Q M N O WAS THERE IN THIS ALVEOLE A TOOTH WITH THREE DENTICULES OR WERE THERE TWO TEETH WITH TWO DENTICULES EACH OF WHICH THE ANTERIOR TOOTH HAVING SOMETIME PREVIOUSLY FALLEN OUT THE ALVEOLE FOR ITS ANTERIOR ROOT HAS BEEN OBLITERATED WE ARE INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT THE LATTER WAS THE FACT IT MAY ALSO BE ASKED WLHETHER THE TOOTH REPRESENTED IN PLATE XX FIG 1 D CORRESPONDS WITH THAT IN PLATE XXI E IN PLATE XXIV E AND IN PLATE XXV E WE THINK NOT CUVIER IT IS TRUE CONSIDERS THE TOOTH WITH THREE DENTICULES IN THE ADULT JAW REPRESENTED IN PLATE III FIG 1 GRANDE MASTODONTE TO CORRESPOND WITH THE POSTERIOR TOOTH WITH THREE DENTICULES IN THE YOUNG JAW REPRESENTED IN THE SAMNE PLATE FIG S AND 4 BUT THE DIFFERENCE IN THE SIZE OF THESE TWO TEETH AND EVEN IN THEIR SHAPE THE FORMER BEING PROPORTIONABLY BROADER IS VERY STRIKING IN ALL THE JAWS WE HAVE EXAMINIED THIS CHARACTER IS CONSTANT THUS COMPARE THE TOOTH REPRESENTED IN PLATE XX D WITH THAT IN PLATE XXI E PLATE XXIV E AND PLATE XXV E IT WOULD THEREFORE SEEM THAT THE MASTODON HAS THREE TEETH WITH THREE DENTICULES BUT TO RENDER THIS CERTAIN WILL REQUIRE FURTHER SPECIMENS THE SUCCESSION OF THE TEETH IN THE MASTODON TAKES PLACE AS FOLLOWS IN ALL THE JAWS THE ANTERIOR TEETH WILL BE OBSERVED TO BE MOST WORN AS THE ANTERIOR TEETH ARE WORN DOWN OTHERS ARE FORMED POSTERIOR THE ANTERIOR TEETH SUCCESSIVELY FALL OUT THEIR ALVEOLES ARE OBLITERATED AND  RECHERCHES SUR LES OSSEMENS FOSSILES TOM I PARIS 1831OFMASTODONS WITH REMARKS ETC

WAS USUALLY NOT MORE THAN EIGHT AND IN OLD AGE ONLY FOUR THE FACT OF THE JAWS REPRESENTED IN PLATES XXVIII AND XXIX HAVING BELONGED TO ADULT ANIMALS IS THUS CONCLUSIVELY ESTABLISHED ALL THE TEETH

ACADEMY OF NATURAL SCIENCES OF THIS CITY WE FEEL PERSUADED THAT IT DOES NOT APPER TAIN TO THAT SPECIES THE DENTICULES HAVING NO LONGITUDINAL COMMISSURE IT PROBABLY BELONGS TO A NEW SPECIES AND WE WOULD SUGGEST THE PROPRIETY OF DEDICATING IT TO PROFESSOR BORSON UNDER THE NAME OF M BORSONI IF THE DIFFERENCES PRESENTED BY THE SPECIMENS WE HAVE DESCRIB ED BE CONSIDERED AS SUFFICIENT TO INDICATE A

COLLECTION A FRAGMENT OF THE ANTE RIOR PORTION OF A LOWER JAW WITH THE CHIN ROSTRATED SOMEWHAT LIKE THAT OF THE TETRACAULODON BUT MORE EXPANDED AND WITHOUT ALVEOLI IT CONVEYED THE IDEA TO SOME OF THE NATURALISTS WHO HAD EXAMINED IT OF ITS BEING THE ADOLESCENT STATE OF THE ANIMAL DESCRIBED BY DR GOD MAN THE TUSKS HAVING FALLEN OUT AND THEIR ALVEOLI BEING JUIST OBLITER ATED WE CANNOT HOWEVER CONSIDER SUCH A VIEW AS THE CORRECT ONE THE FACT SHOWN BY OUR SPECIMENS THAT THE TUSKS EXIST IN ALL AGES OF THE ANIMAL IS A SUFFICIENT DISPROVAL OF IT I MUST NOT CLOSE THIS COMMUNICATION WITHOUT EXPRESSING THE OBLI GATIONS I AM UNDER TO VARIOUS GENTLEMEN FOR THE LIBERALITY WITH WHICH THEY HAVE FACILITATED MY INVESTIGATIONS AND EVEN PLACED AT MY DISPOSAL SUCH SPECIMENS AS I WISHED TO COLLECT TOGETHER FOR THE PUR POSE OF MINUTE COMPARISON TO THE LIBERALITY OF THE TRUSTEES OF THE BALTIMORE MUSEUM I AM INDEBT ED FOR THE USE OF THE SPLENDID JAW OF THE M GIGANTEUM BELONGING TO THAT COLLECTION J P WETHERILL ESQ WITH HIS CLHARACTERISTIC LIBERALITY HAS ALSO PLACED AT MY DISPOSAL HIS VALUABLE COLLECTION DEPOSITED IN THE CABINET OF THE ACADEMY OF NATURAL SCIENCES AND THE MOST INTERESTING SPECIMENS BELONGING TO WHICH ARE SUBMITTED TO THE INSPECTION OF THE MEMBERS MR RUBENS PEALE THE PROPRIETOR OF THE REMAINS OF THE ANIMAL DESCRIBED BY DR GODMAN HAS ALSO PLACED AT MY DISPOSITION THOSE REMAINS AND THE INFERIOR MAXILLARY IS NOW IN THE CABINET OF THE SOCIETY TO THE TRUSTEES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA AND DR HORNER I AM IN DEBTED FOR THE OPPORTUNITY OF FIGURING AND DESCRIBING A VERY FINE FRAG MENT OF A LOWER JAW BELONGING TO THE WISTAR MUSEUM THE PRO PRIETORS OF THE MAGNIFICENT COLLECTION OF BONES RECENTLY DISINTERRED AT BIGBONE LICK BY CAPTAIN FINNEL AND NOW EXHIBITING AT NEW YORK LIBERALLY AFFORDED ME THE GREATEST FACILITIES IN EXAMINING THAT COLLECTION AND EVEN ALLOWED ME THE LOAN OF A HIGHLY INTERESTING TOOTH BELONGING TO ITT X THE TRUSTEES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA SUBSEQUENTLY ALLOWED THIS JAW TO BE DEPOSITED FOR SEVERAL MONTHS IN THE CABINET OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY T IN THIS COLLECTION THERE ARE PORTIONS OF FOURTEEN INFERIOR MAXILLARY BONES OF THE MASTODON ABOUT ONE HUNDRED TEETH SOME ENORMOUS TUSKS AND THE MOST PERFECT CRANIUM THAT HAS EVER YET BEEN DISCOVERED336 DESCRIPTIONS OF INFERIOR MAXILLARY BONES TO WILLIAM COOPER ESQ OF NEW YORK I AM INDEBTED FOR THE OPPOR TUNITY OF EXAMINING THE VALUABLE COLLECTION OF MASTODON BONES IN THE CABINET OF THE LYCEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY OF THAT CITY AND STILL FUR THER FOR HIAVING COMMUNICATED TO ME SONME HIGHLY INTERESTING SPECI MENS BELONGINLG TO HIS PRIVATE CABINET THIS LIBERALITY WILL BE AT ONCE APPRECIATED BY THE NATURALIST WHEN IT IS STATED THAT MR COOPER HAS HIMSELF BEEN LONG ENGAGED IN THE INVESTIGATION OF THE HISTORY OF THE MASTODON  THAT HE HAS VISITED BIGBONE LICK FOR THE PURPOSE OF OB TAINING MATERIALS AND THAT UPWARDS OF A YEAR SINCE HE COMMUNICATED TO THE LYCEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY NEW YORK SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE DENTITION OF THAT ANIMALT WE HAVE REASON FURTHER TO HOPE THROUGH THE EXERTION OF OUR FRIEND PROFESSOR PATTERSON OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA TO BE ABLE TO EXHIBIT TO THE SOCIETY THE LOWER JAW BELONGING TO THE MUSEUM OF THAT UNIVER SITY NOTICED BY DR GODMAN AND ALSO TO PRESENT A DESCRIPTION AND DRAWING OF THAT BONE IT MAY BE ALLOWABLE HERE TO ADD THAT GREAT CONFIDENCE MAY BE PLACED IN THE ACCURACY OF THE DRAWINGS WHICH ACCOMPANY THIS PAPER AND WHICH WERE ALL TAKEN WITH THE AID OF A CAMERA LUCIDA BY MR DRAY TON WHOSE SKILL AND ACCURACY IN HIS ART THE TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY BEAR AMPLE EVIDENCE SINCE I HAD THE HONOUR OF SUBMITTING TO THE SOCIETY IN MAY LAST THE PRECEDING COMMUNICATION I HAVE BEEN FAVOURED BY THE LIBERALITY OF THE VISITERS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA WITH THE LOAN OF THE INFERIOR MAXILLARY BONE OF THE TETRACAULODON ALLUDED TO BY THE LATE DR GOD MAN IN HIS MEMOIR PUBLISHED IN THE THIRD VOLUME PAGE 478 OF OUR  THE SOCIETY MAY EXPECT TO RECEIVE FROM MR COOPER SOME OF THE RESULTS OF THESE RE SEARCHES AND WE HAVE NO DOUBT THAT HE WILL SUPPLY MANY OF THE DEFICIENCIES IN THIS MEMOIR HE WILL ALSO PROBABLY DESCRIBE MANY BONES OF THE MASTODON WHICH IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN US TOO FAR FROM OUR MAIN PURPOSE WHICH WAS TO REFUTE THE BELIEF THAT DR GODMANS ANIMAL WAS ONLY THE YOUNG OF THE GIGANTIC MASTODON TO DESCRIBE T THESE HAVE NOT BEEN PUBLISHED THE AUTHOR BEING UNABLE TO SATISFY HIMSELF IN RELATION TO SOME POINTS WHICH WE HAVE BEEN SO FORTUNATE AS TO ESTABLISH FROM THE SPECIMENS IN THE CABINET OF OUR SOCIETYOF MASTODONS WITH REMARKS ETC 337 TRANSACTIONS AND I HAVE NOW THE GRATIFICATION OF EXHIBITING IT TO THE SOCIETY AND OF PRESENTING TO THEM THE ACCOMPANYING DESCRIPTION AND DRAWINGS THIS SPECIMEN CONSISTS OF THE RIGHT HALF OF THE LOWER JAW TWO TEETH THE CHIN AND A PORTION OF ONE TUSK WITH THE SOCKET FOR THE OTHER ITS LENGTH IS TWO FEET THREE INCHES HEIGHT FROM THE BASE OF THE RAMUS TO THE UPPER EDGE OF THE ALVEOLAR PROCESS SIX INCHES IN GENERAL FORM THIS BONE CORRESPONDS IN THE MOST MARKED MANNER WITH TWO OF THE SPECIMENS BELONGING TO THE SOCIETY AND ONE OF WHICH IS REPRESENTED IN PLATE XXVIII THE MUSCULAR IMPRESSIONS AND TUBER OSITIES AT THE OUTER AND POSTERIOR PORTION OF THE JAW ARE HOWEVER LESS STRONGLY MARKED IN THE FORMER AS WAS TO BE EXPECTED FROM THE DIFFERENCE IN AGE OF THE ANIMALS IT WILL BE ALSO OBSERVED THAT THE ANTERIOR AND UPPER EDGE OF THE CORONOID PROCESS PROJECTS FORWARD IN THE LATTER BUT IT MUST BE RECOLLECTED THAT THAT PART IS MUTILATED IN THE JAW REPRESENTED IN PLATE XXVIII THE CONDYLOID PROCESS IS DEFICIENT AND THE UPPER EDGE OF THE SEMI LUNAR NOTCH AND OF THE CORONOID PROCESS IS SLIGHTLY MUTILATED THE POSTERIOR TOOTH IS CONTAINED IN A BONY CAVITY AT THE BASE OF THE CORONOID PROCESS BUT IS VISIBLE AT THE INNER ASPECT OF THE JAW IT HAS EIGHT POINTS AND A LARGE TALON IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FROM ITS POSITION IN THE JAW TO OBTAIN CORRECTLY ITS ADMEASUREMENTS ANTERIOR

STILL REMAIN BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE TEETH ARE LOST HAD THEY BEEN STILL IN THE JAW IT WOULD HAVE ENABLED US TO SETTLE THE POINT RESPECTING THE NUMBER OF TEETH POSSESSED BY THE ANIMAL THE ANTERIOR SURFACE OF THE CHIN IS SLIGHTLY MUTILATED THE PLATE OF BONE FORMING THE BASE OF THE SOCKETS FOR THE TUSKS IS DEFICIENT THE LEFT ALVEOLUS IS EMPTY THE RIGHT CONTAINS A FRAGMENT OF A TUSK THIS TUSK

Professors Bagley and Judd on Enlarging the American Elementary School in the May number of School Review is a most valuable contribution to the movement for a better adjustment of the school to the needs of the children and of American society However there is one shortcoming in the statement it seems to me to which attention should be called Whether542 THE SCHOOL REVIEW the needs of the retarded children were omitted because of oversight or because this was one of the points on which the joint authors could find no common ground I know not But every junior high school every seventh eighth and ninth grades worthy a place in a deomocratic school system con tains a large number of overage children The statement fails in two ways a It does not call attention to the fact that the school if developed to meet the needs of adolescent children must accept all mentally normal adolescents since it cannot be of maximum help to children who never reach it b It must make its instructional program so worthwhile that these pupils will remain in school to deny vocational preparation to fourteen fifteen and sixteen year old children is undemocratic and inefficient in the extreme For overage children do leave school in the seventh eighth and ninth grades in disconcerting numbers Offering honest vocational preparation keeps many of them in school where the school organization the teachers and at least part of the curriculum are powerful influences to preserve and increase socially valuable characteristics and resources of these boys and girls who dont like books It is unthinkable that the authors of the statement would continue to force these overage adolescent children out of school in the name of democracy That would be down right stupid One must face the actual situation and then this academic danger of social castes turns out not to exist And if it did exist would the sensible way to meet it be to drive out of school all but the upper caste No one who actually develops a democratic junior high school and follows up the pupils who drop out of school would be willing to say to his overage pupils If you want special training you cant have it here Youll have to go to the private business college the trade school enter an apprenticeship For the man in the work knows that his overage children who leave school do not all continue their education TheCOMMUNICATIONS 543 boy who enters trade school or an apprenticeship loosed from the schools influence often drops out to take a more immedi ately desirable job which he leaves for another more alluring one and soon he may appear around the school at dismissal time and one may find on inquiring that he works in the poolroom nights This is what happens in real life situations Professor Davis excellent article on Junior High Schools of the North Central Territory 191718 in the same issue of School Review shows p 330 that nearly 68 per cent of the principals felt that some adaptation to individual needs was the chief reason for establishing the reformed school yet P 333 only 51 I per cent I5 schools had any distinctive trade instruction Surely a good deal of a strawman to be cudgelling Wont someone whose voice and pen are more potent who can command a respectful audience please start a crusade for common sense in this alleged contention of democracy vs trade preparation for overage children Wont he point out that the admission of children to the junior high school at least one full year before the legal age for leaving school is fundamental and that the next most fundamental thing is that the school having admitted them must do all in its power to keep them that this means in some schools that the regular junior high school commercial elective must be paralleled by a vocational preparation in officepractice filing typewriting posting etc in some schools that the manual training elec tive must be paralleled by preliminary training in bricklaying electricwiring etc in some schools that the home economics elective must be paralleled by a trade training in machine operation in dress altering in millinery that these practical opportunities must be open to all overage pupils that this is to be done not so pupils will leave school but because this training keeps them in school not so as to develop castes but so as to prevent castes not to make the school undemocratic but to make it serve Democracy the open road for oppor tunity that the school which lets its children drop out and544 THE SCHOOL REVIEW does not follow them up that knows not apparently cares not where they have gone will not be tolerated when its criminal negligence is appreciated The greatest credit is due F E Spaulding who said in the 190o Newton Report In brief we are transforming a system of education which set up a fixed and arbitrary standard of selection and rejection a standard which few or no children can perfectly fit which very many can fit scarcely at all which did its utmost to make alike those children that survived the test into a system that welcomes seeks all children fits work and methods to individual needs and strives to send children out into the world just as individually diverse as nature designed them to be and as the diversity of service which awaits them requires Let me end as I began the joint article is timely and valu able and a debt of gratitude is due the authors for this terse clearcut statement on Enlarging the American Elementary School Great progress is made when possible contentions between our prophets are dissolved May we not hope that this mis understanding concerning trade training opportunities for overage children in the junior high school will some time disappear PHILIP W L Cox Ben Blewett Junior High

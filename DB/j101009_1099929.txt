per Annum Single Numbers 50 Cents Communications with reference to CONTENTS should be addressed to the EDITOR at Richmond Va BUsINESs communications to the PUBLISHERS Legal periodicals have begun again to discuss the whipping post and the states of Maryland and Delaware are once more coming in for their share of odium which is attached to this relic of bar Th Whipping barism Few writers on the subject agree that Post the whipping post has any place among a civilized Post people and even those who admit its efficacy would coonfine its use to punishment for wife beating President Roosevelt in his recent message indicates that some forml of cor poral punishment shouLld be meted out to a man who strikes the woman whom11 he lias promised to love and protect hut it occurs to us that is is not so important to use this method of puinishment for particular crimes as it is to use it for that class of criminals upon whom other modes of punishment have proven ineffectual Punisl ment is not inflicted for vengeances sake but that the ofTender may be reformed and others may be deterred from committing crime When the person neither reforms nor deters it has failed in its pur pose Could there be any good reason why the whipping post should not be used in the case of a criminal upon whom imprisonment has been tried in vain  Our city jails are filled with men supported at public expense who tirmie after time have been sentenced to impris onment for crime and yet their punishment seems not to have had the slightest deterring effect Criminals are of varied tempera ments and the whip would ofteni restrain where confinement has no terrors Why should Vilrginia puit herself to thle great ex pense of suipporting in jail these habitual crimiiiahs when the laslh would not only relieve the state of the expense but would often acconmplish the more important result of causing the criminal to cease his career of lawlessness We do not claim that the whipping post would in all cases be effectual hut we do claiin that after a man who has been repeatedly imprisoned commits ant736 10 viRGuffwA LAw RBGrER Dee other crime the time has come at least to try some other form of punishment The judges and justices of the commonwealth ought to have the discretion after a criminal has been imprisoned three or more times to order him to be whipped Why continue to in flict upon a man that kind of punishment which has proven in his ease to be without avail We agree that the whipping post should be used only in extreme cases and after milder means have been exhausted but we are in clined to think that those to hold that the lash should never be used are governed more by a mere sentimentality than by consideration of the greatest good to the state and the criminal Pursuant to our desire to makIe the REGISTER as useful as possible to the busy practitioner we have determined to give in this and succeeding issues the following matter 1 A list of Virginia cases annotated in the Americen State Re ports 2 A list of Virginia cases annotated in Lawyeris A New Reports Annotated 3 A list of Virginia cases anno Feature tated in Virginia Law Register 4 A list of Virginia cases overruled by later decisions 5 A list of Virginia cases overruled by statutes The usefulness of these features will be greatly increased if the practitioner will have the reference noted in his Virginia Reports on the margin of the page where the case is reported He may then in using his reports ascertain at a glance whether a case has been commented on in any of the works above enumerated or whether it has been overruled by a later decision or statute In the study of a given case it is obviously of great value to know whether it has been annotated and if so to avail oneself of the collection of similar cases fotnd in the notes as well as of the comments of the anno tator We can not hope to make a complete list of overruled cases but we will publish such as we have collected and will ask the bar to point us to others Thus we hope in time to gather a reasonably complete list The importance of such a list will be readily recog nized by those of us who have suffered the agonies of mortification which comes to one who in the midst of his argument boldly rests his cause on the most able and cogent opinion in v only to be informed by opposing counsel or the court that the case1904 EDITORIAL 737 has been overruled by a later case or by statute Then it is that we feel like the foolish man who built his house upon the sand In this issue we give the list of cases annotated in the American State Reports Sec 1105a 2 Va Code Anno provides that the names of com panies incorporated under that section shall be such as to distinguishn them from any other corporation engaged in asimilar business etc Under this provision the application for incorpor The Names of ation by the Bank of Richmond was resisted by Corporations the Savings Bank of Richmond on the ground that the former name was not such as to dis tinguish it from the latter The commission decided against the complainant and the question now arises whether an appeal lies from the decision of the commission or wvhether the complainant is put to its common law remedies Under the Constitution the conm mission has only to ascertain whether the applicants for the charter have by complying with the requirements of law entitled themii selves to a charter and to issue or refuse the same accordingly Va Const sec 154 Thus it would seemi that while the Constitution has made the duty of the commission purely ministerial yet the duty seemingly im posed by the statute towit the decision of the question of whether the name of one corporation is such as to distinguish it from an otlier involves the exercise of a function in its nature judicial We are indebted to Justice Lamar of the Supreme Court of Georgia for an interesting piece of history which perhaps explains the existence in our state Constitution of sec 52 requiring that the object of an act shall be expressed in its title The Gen Title of eral Assembly of Georgia after the Revolution passed Acts an act for the payment of the late state troops The act which contained a provision voting away a large portion of the public lands was smuggled through the Legislature without its true purpose having been discovered This act known as the Yazoo Act was attacked as unconstitutional but the Su preme Court of the United States in Fletcher v Beck 6 Cranch 87 upheld the law This resulted in the provision inserted in the Georgia Constitution of 1798 that no law should be passed con738 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Dec taining any matter different from what is expressed in the title thereof It seems that this was the first provision of the kind to be found in any state constitution Neither the Constitution of the United States or the older constitutions of the thirteen original colonies contain any such restriction although nearly all of the more recent constitutions of the old as well as the new states have the same or an analogous provision Hence there has naturally grown up around the provision a mass of learning to which the courts of many states have contributed and which will be valuable in determining the not infrequent question of whether acts of our General Assembly comply with the constitutional provision referred to The Virginia decisions on this point are gathered by our asso ciate Mr Garnett in his article on p 106 June number The proprietors of the REGISTER have made arrangements with Mr Henry A Minor of the Lynchburg bar to edit an index volume for the first ten volumes of the LAw REGISTER General Index to We believe Mr Minors work will prove of spe the Register cial value to the Virginia practitioner for the volumes of the LAW REGISTER under the Burks Graves Lile and Bryan were great storehouses of useful informa tion and observations concerning Virginia law The tenth volume will be completed with the April issue and the index will follow shortly thereafter No more just nor timely statute has been recently passed than that making it a misdemeanor to desert without just cause or to wilfully neglect to provide for the support of a wife or minor children in destitute circumstances Statutes of NonSupport similar nature have long existed in some of the other states Those who have the management of the almshouse in larger cities of the state and those engaged in charity work especially among children know of the surprisingly large number of ablebodied men who leave their wives aind children to scuffle as best they may or to be supported bv the charity of others Such men should be taught the duty which they owe to their families and to the state and the statute is already doing valiant work

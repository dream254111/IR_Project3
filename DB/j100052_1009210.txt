and Charity in Massachusetts in its Nineteenth Annual Reportt recommends that the care of all indigent and neglected children be entrusted to the state irrespective of the question of their city or town settlement As a matter of fact the majority of pauper children are now state charges The exceptions are cases due to loss of parents or to parents poverty where the settlement of parents is known It is certain that the minority looked after by overseers of the poor will be much more wisely cared for if they are transferred It is interesting by the way to note that the relative percentages of children under state care who are in institutions selfsupporting in families or at board in families remains about the same as in 1896 The percentages for the last three years are significant 1895 I896 1897 In Institutions  I6 I6 15 In Families without board  56 55 55 In Families with board  28 29 30 It would thus appear that the necessary use of institutions has been minimized about as far as it can be under present conditions Of course it must be remembered that juvenile delinquents who must in nearly all cases be given at least a short training in institu tions before being placed out or returned to their families are included in this 15 per cent The board also recommends that the city and town pauper insane be transferred to state institutions and state control At present these unfortunates may be boarded at town expense in the state asylums but the overseers may if they chose board them in fami lies or keep them in city and town almshouses Thus in I897 there were 907 in the almshouses The boarding in families is coming to be recognized as a very good way of dealing with certain classes of insane But it is doubtful if the overseers have sufficient scientific knowledge to exercise a wise control in this matter and certainly the use of almshouses for confinement is an unmixed evil The fact that a reform of this sort has come so late in so progres sive a state as Massachusetts is probably another bit of evidence of the survival of the old New England town idea  Contributed by Mr F H McIean Fellow in Sociology University of Penn svlvania t I897 Boston Pp 229 lxxxii I57158 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY For those interested in laws of settlement the following will be of moment The board recommends that the statutes be so amended that any adult living in any place in the state for three consecutive years shall gain a settlement that legitimate children shall follow the settlement of their parents and that all persons absent from the state for ten consecutive years shall thereby lose their settlements Abuses in New York CharitiesIn its report for the year 1897 lately transmitted to the legislature the State Board of Charities gives credence to a statement which has been going the rounds for some time to the effect that probably nearly 50 per cent of the popula tion of New York City obtain practically free medical treatment The volume of work carried on by dispensaries is indicated in figures like these In the borough of Manhattan there are 66 or more dispensaries and from 57 of these the board has received re ports for the past year These reports show I043428 cases treated and 1674280 prescriptions furnished an average of I8305 cases and 29373 prescriptions to each dispensary The reason why the board cannot definitely fix the number of dispensaries is because some of them are not incorporated and do not therefore come to the notice of the board The board is still continuing its efforts for legislation which will give it control over dispensaries throughout the state Till then gross abuse of medical charities will probably continue Apparently there is also a considerable overgrowth of institutions for children for the board states that there are now probably 4000 vacant beds in such institutions within New York City Of course money for the establishment of juvenile institutions can probably be obtained with greater ease than for many other charities But the waste indicated in the above figures is certainly a striking one when it is remembered that there is a dearth of homes for the aged in the same city The boards control does not extend beyond incorporated chari ties or those applying for incorporation It has begun to recognize that some charities who do not come into this category are carrying on unwise work Therefore it has very pertinently asked the ques tion Should unincorporated charities be permitted to exist The report thus argues Charitable organizations voluntarily seek to perform a quasipublic service when they undertake to relieve the poor and when their work is wisely planned and properly directed they are frequently capable of doing much good If the contrary Contributed by Mr F H McLean Fellow in Sociology Universitv of Penn sylvauiaSOCIOLOGICAL NOTES be true however as often proves to be the case their efforts com monly serve to aggravate and increase the very evils they are intended to alleviate thus adding to the burden of taxation which falls upon the industrious and lowering the character of the states citizenship Obviously under these circumstances the state is directly interested to a very marked extent and possesses the power and the right to seek out and apply reasonable and adequate remedies  But perhaps the worst abuses which the board has discovered during the year are those connected with the placing out of chil drenabuses which have induced it to champion a bill making it unlawful for either public or private corporations institutions or societies or private persons to place out in families or in private or other homes in this state or elsewhere from this state by indenture or otherwise any orphan abandoned or destitute child except such child be so placed out in accordance with rules and regulations to be established by the State Board of Charities  A special committee of the board made an investigation of the subject during the year and from the testimony adduced it appears that not only are a number of wellmeaning philanthropic societies engaging in the work with more or less intelligence and care but there are also some individuals who are conducting it as a pure matter of business The latter take the children from those responsible for their care for a money consideration and of course do not care par ticularly where they place themr It is apparent how under such conditions gross abuses will rise If the board does not obtain full control of the matter by adequate legislation it is probable that this system of caring for pauper children in New York will be greatly discredited by the discovery and public revelation of bad cases of cruelty neglect and immorality At the time of this writing a compromise bill has been finally passed and is awaiting the veto or approval of the governor It provides for the general regulating of placing out In general it decrees that individuals incorporated societies and noncharitable incorporated societies engaged in this work must be licensed by the State Board of Charities and that incorporated charitable societies who abuse their privileges may be prohibited further activity in this direction such prohibition being subject to review by tlle Supreme Court The bill regulating dispensaries was finally buried in an assembly committee The Development of the Poor Law in England since i885 Under this title Dr P F Aschrott the author of that excellent and widely used book entitled The English Poor Law System has I59i6o ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY recently published in Schmollers Jahrbuclh fur Gesetzgebung a review of the discussion and legislation on this subject in England during the past ten years Probably no period in the history of the English Poor Law has been more fruitful of active and farreaching discussion on this subject certainly not since the two decades pre ceding the adoption of the law of 1834 Dr Aschrott occupies a high position in the administrative system of Germany as Landge richtsiat in Berlin He has moreover spent considerable time in England studying not merely the details of the English administra tive system but also its social conditions and his opinion of the significance of recent changes especially the changes in the attitude of the general public toward the poor law in England is therefore of interest to many persons Naturally his monograph is intended chiefly to inform his own countrymen of the conditions in England with a view to suggesting their bearing upon German conditions Ie begins with some account of the way in which the fundamental principle of English poor law as laid down in the fundamental law of 1834 has been attacked on all sides especially by socialists and collectivists in recent years and he views with evident satis faction the result namely that although several commissions have investigated the matter and have printed long and valuable docu mentary testimony the results as embodied in legislation have merely remedied evils connected with the administration of the older laws and have not in any way modified the fundamental prin ciple of the English poor law He calls particular attention to the way in which special demands for relief particularly those arising from periods when nonemployment was more general than usual were met by such temporary facilities as the Mansion House Relief Fund He finds that this distribution of relief as is usually the experience elsewhere in similar cases was very poorly executed and did very considerable harm He also calls attention to the fact that after careful consideration of the Elberfeld system in the various cities of Germany that the local government board decided that the results did not justify any general introduction of such a system into England Many of the important points brought out in the report of the Poor Relief Commission of I888t and in the report of the Royal Commission on the Aged Poor t constitute an invaluable source of information for all students not merely of poor relief questions but also of existing social conditions in England Speaking in general

introduced in consequence Dr Aschrott considers a most important gain to have been the enlarged work which women are permitted to do in connection with the administration of the poor law They are not only now permitted to vote for poor relief offi cers but are eligible for election to most of the local boards and also to appointment as relief officers In the second part of his monograph Dr Aschrott has discussed at some length the minor administrative changes of recent years grouping them under the following heads i The workhouse principle and outdoor relief 2 administration of workhouses 3 provision for poor children 4 provision for the sick poor 5 the casual poor These divisions correspond with divisions in the authors larger book and will enable those who use that work either in the original German edition or in the English translation to have the material brought down to date In the third and clos ing section some half dozen pages are devoted to recent statistics of various kinds of poor relief in England and some little discussion of the fundamental aspects of the present laws Improved HousingThe Board of Directors of the City and Suburban Homes Company in New York City presented its Second Annual Report on May 5 I898 in which it shows a very considerable activity and a generally prosperous condition in the affairs of the company Five per cent interest was paid to shareholders on March i upon instalments on account of subscription to the capital stock Of the total amount of stock allotted in January I897 five thousand shares of the par value of Io each were reserved for the benefit of persons who might desire them but who had not previously sub scribed This was done with a view to extending the number of stockholders and thus interesting a wider public in the affairs of the company Of this amount of reserve stock all but 193 shares have been recently allotted The company also proposes to increase its capital stock to 2oooooo and this amount was approved at a meet ing held on April 25 The first block of homes constructed by the company are known as the Alfred Coming Clark Buildings and cover nineteen city lots on West Sixtyeighth and Sixtyninth streets between Amsterdam and West End avenues New York City This site is on the outskirts of the tenement region of the upper west side It commands good transportation facilities and is within six blocks of the most densely crowded tenement block in the whole city The following statement will give some idea of the arrange ment of these buildings and of the methods adopted in their man agement The buildings contain in all three hundred and seventythree r61162 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY apartments four stores and an office Seventyfour apartments are of two rooms two hundred and thirtysix of three rooms sixtyone of four rooms and two of five rooms Every apartment is a complete home in itself has an abundance of light and air with thorough ventilation and with partitions between the different dwellings deafened Each apartment has its own watercloset well venti lated and with water supply from tank stationary washtubs and sink of large size hot water supply from a central boiler system gas fixtures and gas attachment to stove or range closets or ward robes and dresser and mantel shelves Dust chutes have been placed on each floor a number of spray baths free for the use of tenants on the first story and in the basement laundries with set tubs to which hot and cold water are supplied and steamheated drying chambers also free for tenants and wood and coal closet and storagerooms Staircases and stair walls are entirely fire proof as are likewise the walls of the first story and the dividing walls between each group of apartments Halls and stairways are well lighted and steamheated The best sanitary principles have been considered in the con struction of these city homes The use of good materials a perfect system of drainage abundance of light air and water avoidance of dark rooms and passages wide clean and airy halls and stair ways make them healthy comfortable and desirable for families who wish to live privately and respectably at moderate rents The comfort and welfare of tenants are sought by providing a thoroughly competent management It is believed that the dis agreeable features of ordinary tenement life will through this means be avoided A few general rules have been established for the good of all Applicants for apartments must furnish at least two satis factory references as well as evidence that they have been accus tomed to pay rents regularly This group is divided into nine buildings One of the build ings comprising about forty apartments was thrown open for occupancy on February 15 last another about March I another about March I5 two more about April I and the remainder about April Io The builders did not fully complete their work until April 23 On April 30 two hundred and seventy of the three hun dred and seventythree apartments and three stores had been let a remarkable showing considering that the tenants are selected under strict rules as to reference and previous rent paying enjoined by the management The total possible rental of occupied apart ments up to April 30 last was 363866 and of this amount 3625 i6 was paid leaving but 1350 of arrears Of this latter sum 3 wereSOCIOLOGICAL NOTES irrecoverable arrears the balance 1o5o representing simply a fail ure to pay in advance Rents are collected weekly in advance collection being made in the apartments by a woman rentcollector and her assistant Up to April 30 there had been four changes of tenancy one was brought about by the death of the tenants wife another by removal from the city a third by a notice to quit and the fourth by voluntary removal All of the apartments were im mediately relet The rentals charged are less per square foot than are asked but without the same conveniences and sanitary advantages in the adjoining neighborhood and slightly lower than the rates obtain ing on Amsterdam avenue in the immediate vicinity The two room and fiveroom apartments are fully let and a waiting list is on file All but ten of the fourroom apartments have been rented Ninetythree of the one hundred and three unoccupied apartments are of three rooms but this is not remarkable considering the very large proportion of this size Applications are being steadily received and undoubtedly in a short space of time the buildings will be full The expenses of management have not exceeded original calcu lations so that when apartments are fully occupied the returns will be sufficient to pay a five per cent dividend upon the capital cost and to provide a safe surplus  A suburban colony of homes is being developed on the vast estate known as Homewood in the Thirtieth ward of the borough of Brooklyn Here a tract comprising five hundred and thirty city lots is owned and the following statement from the report gives an idea of the nature and extent of the work planned for and partially con structed in that section A survey has been made streets and an avenue cut through and graded and sewers water and gas fully laid The work of mac adamizing the streets laying gutters curbs and sidewalks and planting trees and hedges is now proceeding When completed Homewood will be an ideal suburban village IHomewood enjoys excellent transportation facilities two lines of trolley cars running directly to Park Row Manhattan The fare is five cents Homewood maintains a sewerage plant constructed on Colonel Warings system of sewage disposal by bacterial oxida tion so that cesspools the bugbear and danger of suburban residence have been dispensed with Sixtyfive cottages have been erected fiftyfour of which have been sold to purchasers on the twentyyear instalment plan with life insurance These houses have been built by the Sturgis and164 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY Hill Company from designs prepared by Mr Percy Griffin They are either entirely of brick or firststory brick and second story stucco and half timber or entirely of stucco There are no frame buildings The style of architecture is exceedingly tasteful unified without being uniform A wellknown real estate editor has de scribed Homewood as a Shakespearean village The aptness of his characterization technically considered is complete The architect and the builders deserve recognition for their good work The company has made such favorable contracts that houses can be profitably erected and sold for less than ordinary rates Current inquiry and demand seem to indicate that Homewood is likely to develop rapidly and to yield the company substantial returns The average price of cottages already sold is 3ioo This in cludes cost of land buildings grading paving curbing mac adamizing sewers and all improvements The average monthly instalment paid by purchasers is a little over 25 This sum in cludes paying back the principal in twenty years with interest at six per cent upon deferred payments and the premium on a life insurance policy Up to April 30 last one hundred and twenty of the five hundred and thirty lots had been built upon The four hundred and ten lots which remain cost the company about two thirds the price at which fairly well situated property in the neigh borhood without improvements is now being sold The company owns other tracts of land which will be improved in time as its business expands and the demand seems to warrant Many persons interested in similar work are watching this experi ment conducted as it is under the skilled supervision of Dr E R I Gould the president of the company in the hopes that it will prove a model that can be easily adapted to local conditions else where than in New York City Municipal and County Charities in the United StatesThe recent quartercentennial meeting of the National Conference of Charities and Correction which was held in New York City in May one of the sections of which Mr Homer Folks Secretary of the State Charities Aid Association of New York was chairman pre sented a report on Municipal and County Charities including Public Outdoor Relief In addition to a general statement concerning recent experience in dealing with the problems of char ity in large cities the report contains an account of the charitable activities of the seventythree cities in the United States which according to the census of I89o each had a population of more than 4oooo These reports from the various cities contain many items of  Pp 79 Boston Geo H Illis 1898SOCIOLOGICAL NOTES general interest concerning both the methods of administration and the actual outlay for some of the more important items of expendi ture In the general report Mr Folks has devoted himself very largely to municipal charities although three topics were assigned to the committee namely municipal charities county charities and pub lic outdoor relief The restriction of the topic was due to the fact that in the past the conference has devoted considerable attention and published many valuable papers on public outdoor relief and on county charities while the administration of charity in the larger cities has been generally treated with less fullness Mr Folks says So far as charity has become a distinctly municipal undertaking it has shared the general character of the administration of the municipality The cities that have been notorious for inefficiency and corruption have had corrupt and inefficient departments of charities and untold sufferings have thus been inflicted upon the recipients of socalled public charity which in some cases might more truly have been called public cruelty  Then follows some reference to a few of the more notable public scandals in the administration of charities and continuing Mr Folks adds But if municipal charities have shared in the evils of our cities they also share in that wonderful revival of interest in city government which we have witnessed in the last few years In several cities this has passed beyond the realm of discussion and comprehensive movements for the organization of municipal charities upon a more rational basis have been carried to success Speaking of the two recent experiments of special interest namely the reorganization of charities in New York and Boston the following statement is made In one respect at least there is uniformity in these movements Everywhere the tendency is toward a differentiation of the different classes cared for at public expense and the placing of each distinct class under the manage ment of a separate official responsibility The lack of classification one of the evils pointed out in I888 is being corrected The desti tute the insane and the criminal are the three generally recognized classes of public dependents During the past three years New York City has made an absolute division of these three classes In the place of its former Department of Charities and Correction it has a Department of Public Charities and a Department of Correction and has turned over its insane to the care of the state More recently Boston has adopted a somewhat similar plan but has carried the subdivision still farther It has five departmentsfor adult paupers for destitute children for the insane for criminals and ai66 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY separate department for investigation registration etc The City Hospital of Boston it is to be remembered has long been under an administration entirely separate from that of the almlshouse and they are thoroughly dissociated in the public mind Chicago or rather Cook County as we have already seen has its almshouse insane asylum and county hospital under one management and as if that were not bad enough asks the same Board of Commis sioners to build roads and bridges and to perform other important duties As to what constitutes the most efficient governing authority ot a charities department there are two distinct tendenciesonelook ing toward administration by a board of unpaid trustees from five to nine in number similar to boards of trustees of state institutions the other looking toward a concentration of responsibility in the hands of one or at most three salaried commissioners bringing this department into line with most other city departments Phila delphia with its board of five unpaid commissioners Boston with its three boards each of seven unpaid trustees Baltimore with its newly authorized board of nine unpaid supervisors of charities and San Francisco with its unpaid health department in charge of its charities have chosen the former of these two plans New York with its three salaried commissioners with separate and sharply defined administrative jurisdiction in different boroughs St Louis with its four charitable institutions under the control of a salaried health commissioner and Cleveland with its salaried director of charities and correction have chosen the latter plan Each of the two plans has its evident advantages and its peculiar dangers Either plan will secure good results if administered by persons of character and intelligence who have knowledge of and interest in the subject of charity Either plan will fail miserably in the hands of incompetent indifferent or dishonest administrators The merit of either plan lies largely in its influence upon the char acter of the appointments that are likely to be made under it One very important advantage claimed for the unpaid board of trustees is that it lessens the probability of partisan appointments If the unpaid board were certain to accomplish this result there could be no doubt as to its desirability Experience has shown however that unpaid boards have not always proved a sure means of escape from the spoils system There have been unpaid boards of trustees that there were neither wise highminded nor nonpar tisan In fact of all administrations that of an unpaid committee or board composed of party workers whose political service had to receive some slight recognition is the weakest flabbiest and leastSOCIOLOGICAI NOTES effective Accepting the positions for the patronage and public notice involved such appointees receiving no salary do not often feel called upon to give much service in return But while the unpaid board does not offer a sure means of escape from politics it probably does make good appointments more probable A few administrations are so hopelessly political that they will appoint none but party workers even to unpaid places A few mayors there are may their tribe increase who will appoint the best men to either unpaid or paid positions Between these two extremes there are doubtless many appointing powers who would feel that they could safely appoint persons of special fitness to un paid positions but who would fear that they could not make a satisfactory explanation to the party leaders if the positions carried salaries Another advantage of the unpaid board is its presumably wider knowledge and greater wisdom in passing upon the delicate and complicated questions involved in the administration of charity The dangers of the unpaid board arise from a division of respon sibility which too frequently leads to inaction or to hesitation and halfway measures There is also a very real danger of placing in the hands of volunteers duties more arduous and exacting than they can be expected to perform for any considerable period of time The advantages of concentrating power and responsibility in the hands of one salaried official are evidently promptness and the opportunity for executive ability to reap its full fruition without let or hindrance The plan is in line with the general system of muni cipal government in this country so far as we have any system though directly opposed to that of Great Britain and the Continental cities In our cities we have freely abolished boards and commit tees have curtailed the powers of boards of aldermen and common councils as to appointment and confirmation of heads of depart ments and have concentrated responsibility in the hands of a mayor and his appointees It may be a mistake but it has been our general policy up to this time It frankly accepts the risks of partisan appointments and relies for its ultimate success upon the virtue of holding the one responsible official face to face with his responsibility from day to day week to week and month to month TlTe practical operations of the plan adopted by New York in 1895 and of that adopted by Boston in 1897 will be watched with very great interest and may afford data for a more definite conclu sion than can now be reached as to their comparative merits For the present we may profitably withhold decision and each use his best efforts to make the system under which he finds himself work ing bear its best fruits 167i68 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY It would be easy however to lay too much emphasis upon the particular form of organization of the department and too little upon the extent of public interest in its work The recent reorgani zations in Boston and New York have led to many desirable results but is this not due in some measure to an increased public interest aroused in the process of securing the legislative reforms and result ing in a more general willingness to give personal service to public institutions In fact almost any change that is brought about by an enlightened public sentiment breaking through the force of tra dition and precedent is bound to be beneficial Whatever makes the community better informed about a municipal department makes that community more exacting in its demands and more willing to approve liberal expenditures However much municipal charities have suffered from poor organization from the commingling of diverse and unrelated interests they have suffered most of all from lack of a widespread intelligent earnest persistent wisely directed public sentiment Convict Labor and Employment of ForeignersThe General Court of Massachusetts at its session in 1897 passed an order direct ing the General Superintendent of Prisons to examine the various methods of employing prisoners on public works and lands and to submit a special report on this subject to the General Court of 1898 This report which has just been published under the title of  Special Report of the General Superintendent of Prisons in Massachusetts upon the Various Methods of Employing Prisoners on Public Works and Lands  makes just the sort of pamphlet that students of this subject will want to consult in order to find in brief space a general summary of what has been done in this line Mr F G Pettigrove the General Superintendent of Prisons has not attempted an ex haustive inquiry but has succeeded in furnishing a very readable document He refers to other sources of information on this sub ject namely the Second Annual Report of the United States Com missioner of Labor issued in I897 and more especially a document relating to road work done by convicts which was issued by the United States Department of Agriculture under the title of Notes on the Employment of Convicts in Connection with Road Build ing  prepared in I895 by General Roy Stone Mr Pettigroves report contains several fine illustrations and discusses convict work under three heads I Farming 2 Road Work and 3 Public Works in General In the first section par ticular attention is given to the state of affairs in North Carolina where under specially favorable conditions agricultural employ  1898 Boston Pp oSOCIOLOGICAL NOTZS ment can be relied upon to furnish full occupation for convicts but of course for only part of the year The work in Georgia is also discussed and the reasons for the proposed change in the system of hiring out convicts as has been suggested by the Governor of Georgia The most successful road work seems to have been done in North Carolina and the most extensive employment of convicts on public works in general in foreign countries The difficulties in applying any of these suggestions to certain of the Northern States especially in Massachusetts are discussed at some length and the opinion of the General Superintendent seems to be that so far as Massachusetts is concerned the most advisable steps would be in the direction of preparing the material for roadbuilding and in reclaiming waste lands He also discusses the question of building a ship canal across Cape Cod which proposition meets with his approval The Pulpit and Social ProblemsThis is the title of a new pub lication devoted to social and economic questions especially in their ethical relations It is a monthly

j100128,Columbia Law Review,1112165,Vendor and Purchaser Innocent Misrepresentation Rescission of Contract Specific Performance,i246346,RECENT DECISIONS 523 on the ground that the excessive rate consists of payment both for the use and for the risk of the sum advanced as for example bottomry contracts Thorndike v Stone 1831 28 Mass 183 and life annuities In re Naish 1830 7 Bing 150 But in every case there must be a reasonable chance that the principal may be lost or the courts will construe the transaction as one intended to evade the usury laws See Missouri etc Trust Co v Krumseig 1899 172 U S 351 19 Sup Ct 179 The question in the principal case is whether a contract which risks only the legalized return on the loan is within the usury laws when it provides for a rate greater than that allowed by law upon a contingency As a matter of strict interpretation the older decisions holding such contracts to be usurious seem correct since the only risk involved is the return of the legal rate of interest which is really no risk for the amount represented thereby was never advanced by the lender Roberts v Trenmayne 1618 Cro Jac 507 Smith v Nich olas 1837 35 Va 330 But the modern authorities have taken the opposite position where there is no actual intention to evade the usury statute Clift v Barrow 1888 108 N Y 187 15 N E 327 see Rich ardson v Hughett 1879 76 N Y 55 From the point of view of good commercial policy which has for its object an unhampered exchange of money the decision in the principal case overruling a former hold ing Hall v Eagle Ins Co 1912 151 App Div 815 136 N Y Supp 714 affd 211 N Y 507 is commendable The result reached may be thus analyzed the principal advanced plus the maximum rate of inter est becomes a new legalized principal the risking of which in its entirety or in part takes it out of the laws of usury in the absence of a factual intention to evade those laws VENDOR AND PURCHASERINNOCENT MISREPRESENTATIONRESCISSION OF CONTRACTSPEOIFIO PERFORMANCEThe plaintiff in a suit for the return of deposit money and the rescission of a contract for the pur chase of realty had bid on lots A and B relying on an innocent mis representation made by the auctioneer in regard to lot B Held although the plaintiff had contracted to buy lot A only because of his expectation of buying lot B the misrepresentation concerning lot B was not ground for the rescission of the contract to buy lot A since the contracts were not complicated but it would defeat the defendants counterclaim for specific performance Holliday v Lock wood 1917 2 Ch 47 It is commonly accepted that a misrepresentation of a material fact innocent or otherwise inducing a contract for the sale and pur chase of land will be ground either for interference by equity in allowing a rescission of the contract or for a refusal to grant specific performance See Bigham v Madison 1899 103 Tenn 358 52 S W 1074 15 Columbia Law Rev 187 But as an exception to this if the mistake is due to the carelessness of the one resisting the performance of the contract and will not work great hardship specific performance will be granted Tamplin v James 1880 L R 15 Ch 215 However since the exercise of the power of specific performance unlike the jurisdiction over suits to rescind contracts is entirely discretionary equity may refuse to grant the vendor specific performance because of the resulting hardship even though denying the vendee the right to rescind see Rudisill v Whitener 1907 146 N C 403 59 S E 995 Welch Pub Co v Johnson Realty Co W Va 1916 89 S E 707 and therefore an innocent misrepresentation may not be sufficient to 285COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW allow the vendee to rescind but sufficient to defeat the vendors bill for specific performance See Welch Pub Co v Johnson Realty Co supra Fry Specific Performance 5th ed  652 This principle is illustrated by the instant case where a misrepresentation in one of two uncomplicated contracts one contract not conditioned upon the other did not give rise to a right to rescind the other but was sufficient to defeat specific performance because of the unfairness and hardship which would result in granting this kind of relief to the party in the wrong Some courts conveniently escape the difficulty presented by the uncomplicated contracts by fastening upon any suggestion which would combine the two contracts and thereupon allowing a rescission Dykes v Blake 1838 4 Bing N C 463 cf Monds v Birchell 1908 59 Misc 287 112 N Y Supp 249 VENDOR AND PURCHASERVENDORS LIENENFORCEMENT AGAINST SUR VIVING TENANT BY THE ENTIRETYThe plaintiff conveyed land by the entirety to the defendant and her husband and took the husbands note for the purchase price The husband died leaving the note unpaid and the plaintiff seeks to enforce his vendors lien against the wife who defends on the ground that she did not participate in the contract of purchase Held the lien could be enforced Moore v Cary Tenn 1917 197 S W 1093 Where the purchase price for land has not been paid upon con veyance nor security taken for its payment the courts in some juris dictions will ordinarily imply an equitable lien 2 Jones Liens 3rd ed  1061 It would not be profitable to make any further general statements since the decisions involving such questions as in what manner in whose favor and against whom this lien operates are in hopeless conflict 3 Pomeroy Eq Juris 3rd ed  1251 each case being governed by its particular equities See Fisk v Potter N Y 1865 2 Abb App Dec 138 140 The indefiniteness in scope of this lien is to a great extent due to the uncertainty of its origin It has been held to arise out of considerations of natural equity see Fisk v Potter supra or out of the implied intention of the parties Wendell v Pinneo 1906 127 Il App 319 or to rest upon inadequacy of legal remedy since at common law land was immune from attachment See Ahrend v Odiorne 1875 118 Mass 261 The right is not an estate in land but a right to a lien in equity see Berger v Berger 1899 104 Wis 282 80 N W 585 Marchand v Railroad 1910 147 Mo App 619 127 S W 387 3 Pomeroy op cit  1234 and is enforceable against all but

Jones op cit  1081 Bayley v Greenleaf 1822 20 U S 46 but see Lissa v Posey 1887 64 Miss 352 1 So 500 Since the wife in the instant case was in the position of a volunteer she took the land subject to

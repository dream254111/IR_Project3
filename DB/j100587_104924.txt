OBSERVATIONS UPON THEM BY JOHN WARD LL D RHET PROF GRESH AND V P R S,I206914,XXXI AN ACCOUNT OF FOUR ROMAN IN SCRIPTIONS CUT UPON THREE LARGE STONES FOUND IN A PLOUGHED FEILD NEAR WROXETER IN SHROPSHIRE IN THE YEAR 1752 WITH SOME OBSERVATIONS UPON THEM BY JOHN WARD LL D RHET PROF GRESH AND V P R S B E F O R E I ATTEMPTED TO OFFER MY THOUGHTS UPON THESE INSCRIPTIONS I JUDGED IT NECESSARY TO GET THE BEST INFORMATION IN MY POWER WITH REGARD TO THE PLACE AND MANNER IN WHICH THE STONES THAT CONTAINED THEM WERE FIRST DISCOVERED TOGETHER WITH SOME OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH ATTENDED THEM AT THAT TIME FOR THIS PURPOSE I APPLIED MYSELF TO THE REVEREND MR WILLIAM ADAMS MINISTER OF ST CHAD IN SHREWSBURY BY WHOSE MEANS THE DRAUGHTS OF THESE INSCRIPTIONS WERE COMMUNICATED TO THIS SOCIETY 1 AND THAT GENTLE MAN WAS SO OBLIGING AS TO PROCURE FOR ME A VERY PARTICULAR ACCOUNT CONCERNING THEM IN A LETTER FROM THE REVEREND MR ROBERT CARTWRIGHT VICAR OF WROX ETER THE SUBSTANCE OF WHICH IS AS FOLLOWS THE STONES 1 SEE TAB V READ MAY 15 1755197 STONES WERE FOUND IN A FEILD NEAR A MILE FROM WROXETER FORMERLY A ROMAN STATION CALLED URI CONIUM 1 IN THE MONTHS OF SEPTEMBER AND OCTO BER 1752 THE FIRST OF THEM WAS DISCOVERED BY MR JOHN DIAS THE OWNER OF THE FEILD WHOSE PLOUGH STRUCK AGAINST IT AS HE WAS AT WORK IT LAY WITH THE FACE DOWNWARD ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YARDS FROM THE FOUNDATION OF THE OLD WALLS ON THE NORTH EAST SIDE TOWARDS WATLINGSTREET ROAD THE INSCRIPTION UPON THIS STONE WAS FIRST TAKEN NOTICE OF BY MR CARTWRIGHT HIMSELF AND THE REPORT OF IT SOON AFTER INGAGED SOME GENTLEMEN FROM SHREWSBURY AND PARTICULARLY GEORGE EDWARDS ESQUIRE BOTH TO GO AND VIEW IT AND MAKE A FURTHER SEARCH WHEN BY SPITTING THE GROUND THE OTHER TWO WERE DISCOVERED NOT FAR FROM THE FIRST IN THE LIKE SITUATION THE FIRST AND LAST LAY SEPARATE FROM THEIR BASES WHICH BE ING TAKEN UP SEVERAL BROKEN PEICES OF URNS AND DUST OF A GREYISH COLOUR WERE FOUND WITH THEM WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE THE APPEARANCE OF ASHES THEY ARE NOW ALL REMOVED TO AN OLD CHANCEL IN WROXETER CHURCH IN ORDER TO BE ERECTED THERE AGAINST THE WALL THIS ACCOUNT APPEARS SO FULL AND DISTINCT THAT I SHALL NOW GO ON TO GIVE A SHORT DESCRIPTION OF THE STONES WITH THE READING OF THEIR SEVERAL INSCRIPTIONS IN THE ORDER THEY ARE PLACED IN THE TABLE AND THEN ADD SOME FURTHER OBSERVATIONS AS WELL WITH REGARD TO THE STONES THEMSELVES AS THE INSCRIPTIONS UPON THEM NUMBER 1 IS BY THE SCALE SIX FEET EIGHT INCHES HIGH AND ABOUT TWO FEET THREE INCHES WIDE ABOVE THE 1 IN THE YEAR 1701 A ROMAN SUDATORY WAS DISCOVERED AT THIS PLACE A

IN HORSLEY THO NOW IT IS GENERALLY PRETTY MUCH DEFACED THE ROSE LIKEWISE IS VERY COMMON ON SUCH OCCASIONS HORS LEY HAS ALSO GIVEN US A SEPULCHRAL MONUMENT WITH A LION PLACED ON EACH SIDE OF THE FASTIGIUM OR PEDI MENT 2 WITH REGARD TO THE INSCRIPTION THE NAME SECUNDUS STANDS THERE FOR THE COGNOMEN WHICH AT FIRST WAS A PRAENOMEN DENOTING THE SECOND SON AS PRIMUS DID THE FIRST AND TERTIUS THE THIRD BUT AFTERWARDS IT WAS MADE A COGNOMEN AND WHAT WAS BEFORE THE COG NOMEN BECAME HEREDITARY AND SERVED TO DISTINGUISH DIFFERENT BRANCHES OF THE SAME FAMILY AS I HAVE FORMERLY SHEWN ELSEWHERE 3 THE NEXT WORD POL LENTINUS COMES FROM POLLENTIA THE PLACE OF HIS BIRTH BUT AS THERE WERE ANTIENTLY THREE ROMAN CITIES OF THAT NAME IT IS UNCERTAIN WHICH MIGHT BE INTENDED HE IS CALLED MILES LEGIONIS VICESIMAE WHICH WAS ONE OF THOSE LEGIONS AS HORSLEY OBSERVES 4 THAT CAME 1 TOM V PLATE 28 33 38 AND 62 2 CUMBERL XXXIX MR CARTWRIGHT IN HIS LETTER OBSERVES THAT THE TONGUES OF THE LIONS CUT UPON THIS STONE HANG OUT OF THEIR MOUTHS BELOW THEIR UNDER JAWS WHICH HAS BEEN OMITED IN THE DRAUGHT HERE GIVEN OF THEM 3 PHILOS TRANS N 476 PAG 357 4 PAGE 83 OVER200 OVER INTO BRITAIN IN THE REIGN OF CLAUDIUS BUT IN ALL THE BRITISH INSCRIPTIONS HITHERTO PUBLISHED WHERE THE READING IS CERTAIN THE TITLES VALENS VICTRIX DENOTED BY THE INITIAL LETTERS V V ARE ADDED TO THE NAME OF THIS LEGION  AND HOW THEY CAME TO BE OMITED HERE UNLESS THRO NEGLECT OF THE WORKMAN MAY BE DIFFICULT TO APPREHEND FOR TO IMAGINE THIS INSCRI PTION WAS MADE BEFORE THE LEGION RECEIVED THOSE TITLES WOULD BE MERE CONJECTURE WITHOUT ANY AUTHORITY TO SUPPORT IT THE LAST LINE BUT ONE HAS BEEN READ BE EFICIARIUS LEGIONIS PRAEFECTI AND WE FIND INDEED THE TITLE PRAEFECTUS LEGIONIS IN SOME OF GRUTERS IN SCRIPTIONS BUT THIS SEEMS NOT TO HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED TILL PRETTY LATE WHEN EACH LEGION HAD ITS LEGATUS WHO IS SOMETIMES ALSO CALLED PRAEFECTUS 2 BUT IF THAT WAS TO BE TAKEN HERE FOR THE GENUINE READING IT WOULD BRING THIS INSCRIPTION TOO LOW FOR THE FORM OF THE LETTERS WHICH SEEMS VERY WELL TO AGREE WITH THE TIMES OF THE HIGHER EMPIRE I HAVE THEREFORE GIVEN ANOTHER READING OF IT ABOVE WHICH WAS PROPOSED BY A LEARNED FRIEND NAMELY BENEFICIARIUS LEGATI PRIN CIPALIS SINCE IN ONE OF GRUTERS 3 INSCRIPTIONS WE MEET WITH PRINCIPALIS BENEFICIARIUS TRIBUNI WRITEN IN WORDS AT LENGTH 2 AS TO NUMBER II THE HUMAN FACE WITH TWO SNAKES UNDER IT MIGHT PROBABLY BE DESIGNED TO REPRE SENT HECATE A NAME GIVEN TO DIANA AS A DEITY OF THE INFERNAL REGIONS A FIGURE SOMEWHAT LIKE THIS 1 SEE BRIT ROM NORTHUM LXXVIII CHES I AND  III

PUBLISHED BY MR CHISHULL 1 INDEED THE TRIGLA OR MULLET IS SAID BY MYTHOLOGISTS TO HAVE BEEN CON SECRATED TO HECATE 2 BUT THERE IS NO ACCOUNTING FOR ALL THE DIFFERENT FANCIES OF SCULPTORS IN HORSLEY WE FIND TWO DOLPHINS PLACED IN A CONTRARY ATTITUDE WITH THEIR HEADS UPWARDS ONE ON EACH SIDE OF A HUMAN FIGURE AND A PINE APPLE OVER IT 3 AND AS GARLANDS WERE A COMMON ORNAMENT OF SUCH MONU MENTS ONE HANGS ACROSS EACH PANEL OF THIS STONE ABOVE THE INSCRIPTIONS IN THE FIRST OF THESE INSCRIPTIONS THE FORM OF THE EXPRESION CONJUX TRIGINTA ANNORUM IS WHAT I DO NOT REMEMBER TO HAVE MET WITH ELSEWHERE  AND THE POINT ON EACH SIDE THE LETTER I AFTER THE ABBREVIATED WORD CON MUST I PRESUME BE ASCRIBED TO AN ERROR OF THE WORKMAN AND LIKEWISE IN THE SECOND IN SCRIPTION THE DIVISION OF THE WORD DEVCCVS BY A POINT IN THE MIDDLE THE OMITING THE LETTER A IN THE ABBREVIATED WORD AG FOR AGENTE AND AFTERWARDS INTERLINING IT AND THE IMPERFECT LETTER R FOR P IN THE WORD PATRE MAY BEST BE ACCOUNTED FOR IN THAT WAY THE THIRD PANEL MIGHT BE LEFT VACANT IN ORDER TO INSERT SOME OTHER INSCRIPTION AFTERWARDS AND THE LOWER PART OF THE STONE IS NOW WANTING BELOW THE IN SCRIPTIONS III IN NUMBER III THE ORNAMENTAL PART OF THE STONE HAS NOTHING IN IT THAT REQUIRES OBSERVATION 1 ANTIQ ASIAT PAR ALTER PAG 1 2 SEEVOSS DE IDOLOLATR L II C 29 P 167 3 DURHAM IV V O L 49 D D AND202 AND AS TO THE INSCRIPTION THE ABBREVIATED WORD VIC MAY DOUBTLESS STAND FOR VICSIT THE LETTER X BE ING RESOLVED INTO CS AND SO WE FIND THE WORD VIC SIT FOR VIXIT WRITEN AT LENGTH IN HORSLEY 1 BUT THE NAME OF THE LEGION HERE MENTIONED WHICH IS CALLED QUARTADECIMA GEMINA MAY SEEM TO BE ATTENDED WITH NO SMALL DIFFICULTY THE STONE HAPPENS TO BE CRACKED QUITE THRO JUST ACROSS THE NUMERAL FIGURES WHICH EXPRESS THE NUMBER OF THE LEGION BUT IN SUCH A MANNER AS NO WAYS TO DEFACE OR OBSCURE THEM NOW WE LEARN FROM TACITUS THAT FOUR ROMAN LE GIONS WERE SENT INTO BRITAIN IN THE REIGN OF THE EM PEROR CLAUDIUS TWO OF THESE WERE THE TWENTIETH AND THE FOURTEENTH BOTH WHICH ARE MENTIONED IN THESE INSCRIPTIONS AND THE FORMER OF THEM REMAINED HERE THE GREATEST PART OF THE TIME AT LEAST THAT THE ROMANS CONTINUED IN POSSESSION OF THE ISLAND BUT THE LATTER WAS ORDERED HENCE BY NERO THEN SENT BACK BY VITELLIUS AND BEING RECALLED AGAIN AT THE BEGINING OF VESPASIANS REIGN DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE RETURNED ANY MORE  AND THAT HAPPENING AS HORSLEY OB  SERVES BEFORE THE OPPORTUNITY OR HUMOUR OF ERECT  ING INSCRIPTIONS OBTAINED IT IS NOT TO BE WONDERED  AT THAT WE DO NOT FIND THIS FOURTEENTH LEGION  MENTIONED IN ANY INSCRIPTION 2 HOWEVER THIS WROXETER STONE GIVES US BOTH THE NAME OF THAT LE GION AND AN ADDITIONAL TITLE OF GEMINA SUBJOINED TO IT THE ORIGIN OF WHICH TITLE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN OWING TO POMPEY WHO HAD AS CAESAR SAIS AMONG 1 CUMBERL LXX 2 PAGE 80 HIS203 HIS OTHER LEGIONS OF ROMAN CITIZENS UNAM EX SICILIA VETERANAM QUAM ACTAM EX DUABUS GEMELLAM APPELLA VIT 1 THAT THERE WAS A LEGION WHICH BORE THE TITLE OF QUARTADECIMA GEMINA IS EVIDENT FROM SEVERAL OF GRUTERS INSCRIPTIONS BUT THEY ALL RELATE TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND NOT ONE OF THEM TO BRITAIN IT IS MENTIONED ALSO BY DION AS BEING IN HIS TIME THAT IS UNDER THE REIGN OF SEVERUS STATIONED IN PANNONIA 2 BUT IT APPEARS LIKEWISE FROM CAESAR THAT HE HIMSELF HAD THE LEGIO QUARTADECIMA WITH HIM IN SPAIN NOT LONG AFTER THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE CIVIL WAR 3 BEFORE THE TITLE GEMELLA WAS INTRODUCED BY POMPEY AND THEREFORE HAD THE TITLE GEMINA BEEN GIVEN TO THE FOURTEENTH LEGION EITHER BEFORE OR WHILE IT WAS IN BRITAIN IT CAN SCARCE BE SUPPOSED THAT TACITUS WHO SO OFTEN MENTIONS AND EXTOLS THAT LEGION FOR ITS GREAT SERVICES DONE HERE SHOULD INTIRELY HAVE OMITED IT ESPECIALLY AS HE GIVES THAT TITLE TO THE LEGIO TERTIADE CIMA 4 SIR HENRY SAVILE INDEED RECKONS THE LEGIO QUARTADECIMA AMONG THOSE OF GALBA AND ASCRIBES TO IT THE TITLE OF GEMINA 5 BUT HE PRODUCES NO OTHER AUTHORITY FOR IT THAN THE PASSAGE BEFORE MENTIONED FROM DION WHO THERE SPEAKS OF THIS LEGION AS HAVING THAT TITLE IN HIS OWN TIME WITHOUT ANY INTIMATION WHEN IT FIRST RECEIVED IT BESIDES THAT IT DID NOT RE CEIVE THE TITLE OF GEMINA DURING ITS RESIDENCE IN BRI TAIN SEEMS FURTHER EVIDENT FROM HENCE THAT WE FIND 1 B C LIB III CAP 3 2 LIB LV PAG 564 EDIT LEUNCLAV 3 B C LIB 1 CAP 44 4 HIST LIB III CAP 7 5 TRANSLATION OF TACITUS SUB FIN P 218 D D 2 NO204 NO OTHER LEGION HERE AT THAT TIME WITH WHICH IT COULD HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED FOR THE OTHER THREE WHICH CONTINUED LONGER AMONG US NAMELY THE LEGIO SE CUNDA AUGUSTA LEGIO NONA AND LEGIO VICESIMA VALENS VICTRIX REMAINED DISTINCT AFTERWARDS AND ARE ALL PAR TICULARLY MENTIONED BY THOSE DIFFERENT NAMES I SHALL ONLY OBSERVE FURTHER THAT AS THERE ARE TWO LEGIONARY SOLDIERS NAMED IN THIS AND THE FIRST INSCRI PTION MENTION IS THERE MADE OF THE TRIBE TO WHICH EACH OF THEM BELONGED AS ROMAN CITIZENS WHEREAS IN HORSLEY WE HAVE THE MONUMENTS OF THREE SOLDIERS OF THE LEGIO SECUNDA AUGUSTA WITHOUT ANY MENTION OF THEIR TRIBES 1 THERE IS INDEED AT BATH AN INSCRI PTION OF ANOTHER SOLDIER SAID TO HAVE BELONGED TO THE LEGIO SECUNDA ADJUTRIX WHOSE TRIBE IS THERE EXPRESSED BUT AS THAT LEGION DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE EVER BEEN IN BRITAIN HE MAY BE SUPPOSED TO HAVE COME HITHER FOR HIS HEALTH FOR WHICH REASON IT MIGHT BE THOUGHT PROPER TO MENTION THAT CIRCUMSTANCE AND PERHAPS THE MOST PROBABLE WAY OF ACCOUNTING FOR THE SAME THING IN RELATION TO THE PERSONS NOMINATED IN THE FIRST AND LAST OF THESE INSCRIPTIONS NOW UNDER CONSIDERA TION MAY BE TO SUPPOSE THAT THE CHARACTER HERE GIVEN OF THE FORMER AS BENEFICIARIUS LEGATI PRINCIPA LIS MIGHT OCCASION THAT REGARD BEING PAID TO HIS ME MORY IN THIS FUNERAL MONUMENT AND THE LATTER MIGHT COME OVER ON SOME PARTICULAR OCCASION NOT HERE MENTIONED WHILE THE LEGIO QUARTADECIMA GEMINA TO WHICH HE BELONGED WAS STATIONED ELSEWHERE BUT SEVERAL GENTLEMEN IN THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD DESIGNING 1 SCOTL XXXIII MONUM I MIDD I SHORTLY205 SHORTLY AS I AM INFORMED TO RENEW THEIR SEARCH  AND NEAR THE PLACE WHERE THESE INSCRIPTIONS WERE FOUND IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT SOME FURTHER LIGHT MAY BY THAT MEANS BE GAINED FOR THE CLEARING UP THESE DIFFICULTIES XXXII

j100358,The School Review,1075123,How Shall Pupils Be Taught to Estimate Themselves,i244578,HOW SHALL PUPILS BE TAUGHT TO ESTIMATE THEMSELVES i PRESIDENT W J TUCKER Hanover N H I believe that it is a part of the function of the school in the devel opment of character to teach or to help pupils to think rightly about themselves but I do not quite like to call this part of our work the art of selfestimation Nothing as we very well know is more delicate than training in character and the most sensitive if not the most elusive part of this training begins when we try to bring the mind of the individual scholar to bear upon himself You can say to one Do this or  Do that and trust to the effect of the doing upon character but you cannot say to one Think so and so about yourself and expect a like tangible result You are dealing in the one case within the fixed region of duty you are dealing in the other case within the free realm of personality which even in a child quickly asserts its freedom I do not mean that we must act in such a matter as this vaguely but I do mean that we must act under restraints and limitations We cannot plan to take this part of the kingdom of heaven by violence We must at least stop short of the state of mind of the man variously located in the bustling towns of the frontier We havent got round to culture yet but when we do get round to it well make culture hum There are two periods in life of which we feel the charmthe period of unconsciousness and the period of simplicity Unconscious ness is the birthright of the child simplicity is the final result possible to a man Unconsciousness and simplicity are very far apart in timethe whole struggle of a lifetime may intervene but they are very much alike in their effect upon us When we are in the presence of persons who have passed beyond all affectation and assumptions  Read at the Conference of Elementary and Secondary Schools at Dartmouth College 597598 THE SCHOOL REVIEW and all excitements of impatience into the repose of power as expressed in manner and in speech we are as much at home with them as we are with children The charm of their simplicity is upon US Now the period of unconsciousness cannot be indefinitely pro longed any more than one can expect to prolong the stage of mere innocence As soon therefore as we are obliged to part company in any degree with the unconsciousness of the child we must begin it seems to me to train toward simplicity The end may be a long way off and it may be reached only through a good many inconsisten cies and contradictions but there is no other end worth striving after as the expression of the individual life especially of its power and virtue Unconsciousness is the divine hint of that far greater end which we are to work out each for himself as the expression of his nature How shall we effect or begin to effect the transition from uncon sciousness to simplicity  As we take those coming to us who have never thought much about themselves but who are being forced in so many ways to think of themselves how shall we gradually teach them so to think that they may reach that expression of themselves so much greater than unconsciousness namely simplicity  Apparently this is a problem peculiar to modern education The supreme fact of modern life is publicity The life of the home is open The nursery is anywhere in the house or on the piazza The child knows everybody and is known of everybody within the ordinary social range of the family The school represents the next course in publicity not simply because it brings so many together but because it has become one of the easier places to exploit Our schools are within immediate reach of the press Reporters have their school assignments Nothing which is unusual and therefore interesting to the public is allowed to escape And the usual thing if of interest like athletics has its regular space I am not calling up this fact of publicity to denounce it or to complain of it but to state it as the circumstance in which we must train for character As between modern publicity with all its glare and mediaeval privacy as it was then or as it may still linger with its dank atmosphere I prefer to take my chance as a teacher andPUPILS TAUGHT TO ESTIMATE THEMSELVES 599 as a parent in the world of today But we may make too many concessions to publicity we are making too many concessions to it perhaps I should say in many cases sacrificing to it The doctrine which I would have preached up and down through our schools and colleges to all within is Accept yourselves not Assert yourselves The chief mark of academic power from the least unto the greatest ought not to be that it is most in evidence and the chief aim of academic striving ought not to be to be most in evidence What is the immediate object which we are to keep in view from first to last in teaching our pupils how to think rightly of themselves  I will answer the question negatively because the negative aspect of the question is nearer and more urgent than the positive We are to strive by all means to prevent them from falling into the habit of thinking of themselves in terms of second values We have to meet here an almost inevitable tendency It is the secondary estimates of personal life with which the child becomes familiar at the outset They are the estimates which most of the people whom the child knows are entertaining In many homes they are the sufficient and satisfying estimates I think that the greatest moral function of our public schools and of our great private schools is the correction of social standards which if not corrected will declare themselves in the reduced or perverted lives of the children of the nation I believe that the average school is more critical of standards of character than the average home In the first place the aierage teacher thinks more about the development of character than the average parent His mind is more steadily occupied with thoughts which are germane to character He is not so immediately concerned with questions of material or social success In the second place the teacher deals with standards where the parent deals with situations He is not called upon to make so many practical variations from his standards which in the end become demoralizing And in the third place the school has the decided advantage over the home in the way of moral impression in the fact that you can impress the one through the many better than you can impress one alone The moral sentiment of a school once created is a constant and a saving force It comes nearer than anything of which I am aware to realizing the idea of  salvation by fellowship600 THE SCHOOL REVIEW The school then can do much to stay the tendency of its pupils to think of themselves in terms of second values By its command of their time it can prevent many of them from committing themselves to insufficient and unsatisfying employments Probably onehalf of those who remain in school till eighteen or twenty make very differ ent decisions in regard to their lifework from those which they were ready to make at fourteen and in nearly every case the delay is immensely to their advantage as well as to the advantage of society The natural growth of ideals within this period is away from the superficial I think that success even is not quite so big a word at twentyone as it is at some earlier stages or if it be still the ruling word it has to do with objects of larger and more enduring values Meanwhile what is the process through which this advance in the right estimation of self is made if it is normal and genuine  Certainly it is not at the beginning through introspection Intro spection wherever it still exists within the limits of school life is a relic of mediaevalism It does not start out of the conditions of the modern world It is still true as Tennyson sings that Selfreverence selfknowledge selfcontrol These three alone lead life to sovereign power but they are not realized today through introspection The world of the average schoolboy or schoolgirl is altogether an objective world with the great objective virtues in the foregroundreverence obe dience honor generosity charity I think that Mr Rhodes has expressed the modern spirit in its moral aspect in two of the personal requirements for the Rhodes scholarship After prescribing pro ficiency in scholarship and in athletics he adds III qualities of manhood true courage devotion to duty protection of the weak kindliness unselfishness and fellowship and IV the exhibition during school days of moral force of character and of instincts to lead and to take an interest in his schoolmates for those latter attributes will be likely in afterlife to guide him to esteem the per formance of public duties as the highest aim There are three influences coming out of school life through which in the order of today the schoolboy is learning how to think of himself These influences we can direct or modify and in so doing we contribute I think our most effective aid in developing the artPUPILS TAUGHT TO ESTIMATE THEMSELVES 6i0 of selfestimation These three influences are first the reflex influence from association to the degree of comradeship second the reflex influence from work and third the direct influence of the teacher growing out of his estimation of the individual scholar First the reflex influence from companionship I have spoken of the sentiment of a school as a factor in the development of individ ual character I note a change which has taken place in this regard largely within the past decade that whereas the school of the earlier times was repressive of individuality the school of the present time stimulates individuality The change is healthful but it requires on the part of the master more careful and tactful dealings with some scholars The change has led some boys and girls to the premature announcement of themselves usually in uncomfortable sometimes in bad ways A position is taken from which it is difficult to recede School reputation is quickly made and then as elsewhere one has the reflex influence from it The word is attributed to Lord Byron I have never been able to verify it Men took me to be what I said I was and I came to be what they thought I was A wise master of course never takes a prematurely bad boy at his word nor is he too eager to take school rumors about bad boys Anyone who has made a false estimate of himself and has established a reputation upon it has greatly complicated his case as a matter of school discipline but he is still entitled to treatment according to the insight of the teacher The reflex influence from companionship rests upon the principle that our estimate of ourselves is determined largely by our behavior toward others This at least is the way the principle works through good behavior A man who acts with courtesy comes to think of himself as a gentleman as being that is under the obligations of a gentleman Unfortunately a man who does brutal things does not thereby come to think of himself as a brute It is enough however that the principle works toward the good And the school is the place above all others where the principle works for the good most effectively I think that a sensitive and honorable schoolboy grows upon himself through the growing thought of himself faster than any other person The more he thinks of himself in relation to others the more he scorns the mean or careless thought of himself602 THE SCHOOL REVIEW which lets in the mean or careless act Gradually he becomes in a perfectly simple and natural way representative of the best things for which the school stands He almost seems to be responsible for its best life I had a charming illustration a little time ago of this representa tive and responsible quality in a boys life I was the guest at the recent inauguration of Dr Alderman at the University of Virginia of a family in which there were two boys eight and six years old The little fellows each in his own way played the part of host simply naturally sincerely I was their guest as much as I was the guest of their father and mother They were thoroughly imbued with the spirit for which the home stood that of a most gracious hospitality It is entirely possible for the spirit of a school to possess a boy as naturally as the spirit of the home possessed these two little southern gentlemen Mr Goschen said at the unveiling of the statue of Thomas Hughes at Rugby He was the most distinguished school boy that ever lived It was the fine distinction of Thomas Hughes that he made that same distinction possible to the schoolboys of England and America School life is full of opportunity Think of the immediate opportunity in athletics School and college senti ment has given the athlete the place of honor He has displaced the scholar the debater every other type of the superior fellow What return can he make for so great a recognition  He can try to think of himself in absolute terms of honor and integrity He can put aside all claims for any other kind of reward He can refuse to lend himself to any dishonorable or questionable practices He can do what rules cannot dohe can make athletics perfectly clean and free from all commercialism by simply thinking of himself only in terms of absolute honesty and honor In passing from the reflex influence of companionship to the reflex influence from work we see at once that the influence from work is less active and much more subtle but it is very real Take the mat ter of the quality of work referred to so vividly by Professor Adams Is it not clear that a boy who forms the habit of doing twothirds of a boys work will in time come to think of himself as twothirds of a man at least for all practical purposes  Will he not find himself saying when the chance of a full man comes to him No I am not equal to it that is I am not the full man PUPILS TAUGHT TO ESTIMATE THEMSELVES 603 But we are concerned especially with the effect of the change in the subjectmatter of school work upon school ideals Every child today is educated as a modern Even among the relatively small number trained in the subjectmatter of the ancient classics the method of training is so essentially modem that the subjectmatter becomes secondary The child of today no matter what he is studying is no longer a child of the past His ideals are not there Plutarchs heroes are not his heroes His daily work lacks at least that kind of idealism It does not stimulate him to think of himself in the larger terms of other mens lives Modern education waits the distinctly idealizing process and therefore the distinctly idealizing influence The new subjectmatter is in large degree the raw material of knowledge not having passed through the alchemy of time devoid of sentiment lacking in those associations which make up the moral increment of knowledge It represents literatures which have not reached the final form sciences which run straight to application rather than to philosophical conclusion and theories of society and government which are too serious and urgent to be held in academic discussion But the new subjectmatter of knowledge is powerful nevertheless subtle enough to create an atmosphere and tangible enough to create an enviroment Mr A J Balfour has used a term which expresses with rare exactness one of the relations of the new knowledge to our thinking It has created he says a new mental framework I quote the brief passage which holds this definition In an address upon The Nineteenth Century he remarks that it is not the dis tinction of this century that it has witnessed a prodigious and unexampled growth in our stock of knowledge Something much more important than this has happened Our whole point of view has altered The mental framework in which we arrange the separate facts in the world of men and of things is quite a new framework The spectacle of the universe presents itself now in a wholly changed perspective we not only see more but we see differently Yes we are seeing differently way down to childhood and as I believe we are beginning to see with clearer and I hope with finer vision but we are not yet getting the reflection of ourselves as we must have it for the best knowledge of ourselves If we are to get personal results out of science we must make science a culture as604 THE SCHOOL REVIEW well as a utility I do not say this in the language of academic snob bery We must go on in our work of the schools creating the child of the shop and the child of the marketplace but we may also if we are capable create out of this same child of the shop and of the marketplace the child of nature and of the new humanity I come to the direct influence of the teacher the master at this one point namely in aiding the pupil to estimate himself How direct and continuous and cumulative is the influence of the teacher It passes from point to point as the pupil advances never lessening never losing its obligation never satisfied but expressing itself in new and more delicate forms First to awaken to satisfy the old pro phetic definition of master and scholarhim that awaketh and him that answereth then to interpret to translate action and thought back into terms of personal values and then to define to take part with the pupil in this work of selfestimation How necessary it is for the master to carry on his work in the scholar to some fit conclu sion Suppose that he stops with the awakening of the mind What does the pupil really know of the new and strange stirrings of power within him Who shall tell him what these things mean what they mean to him  Who shall teach him how to judge of those increments or reductions of personal power of which he is conscious even though they may follow manifestly from his own industry or from his own neglects  Here comes in the most responsible because it is the final office of the teacher I do not say that it is always to be exercised Perhaps in the majority of cases it is better that we should not tell our pupils what we think of them Our judgment may be premature it may be an overestimation which may work harm it may be a misjudg ment for want of insight or for want of data But when the fit time comes and the sure judgment may be uttered then it is wrong to withhold the estimate which may make the career if not the life itself Where there is no counsel purposes are disappointed a word in due season how good it is I doubt if the majority of great men became great entirely of their own motion It was a keenerinsight than their own which read the first signs of power It was a stronger faith than their own which announced the future If it were not for the encouraging service ofPUPILS TAUGHT TO ESTIMATE THEMSELVES 605 the teachers of our elementary and secondary schools in this process of selfestimation we should have a vast increase in the amount of arrested development I cannot put too great a value upon this supplementary work of the teacher for the scholarthis carrying him over into his own future usually by giving him some vision of it What is the profit of communicating knowledge upon knowledge to those whom we do not help to know themselves  How long will the outer knowledge last without the inner knowledge  I said in the beginning that it was a part of the function of the school to aid in the transition from unconsciousness to simplicity to start the movement that way and I have tried to show how this is best accomplished by wise aids in the delicate art of selfestimation Let us keep the end in view though our chief work may be at the beginning Let us be patient with all necessary divergence from our task or interference with it Let us never for a moment suppose that simplicity means any suppression or reduction of power It may mean the laying aside or getting rid of superfluous things As an oldtime professor once criticised one of my college classmates who had delivered an eloquent oration Blank if you would lay aside your eloquence you would make a fine speaker But we must be patient even with eloquence with exuberance of any kind even unto waywardness if it is the result of power Power we must have to make simplicity Simplicity is the resultant of many powers coming at last into harmonious action As unconsciousness expresses the full child simplicity expresses the full man It expresses the man in his unitynothing left out nothing lost by the way nothing denied its legitimate freedom above all things nothing sacrificed to selfishness When a man once a scholar comes to that fine and powerful conclusion and men ask how it all came about for a teacher to be able to say to himselfto himself not to othersI know the way I had a part in the result is not that the teachers reward

American Society of Naturalists will soon discuss Genotypes or pure lines of Johannsen It is not stated who is responsible for this use of the word genotype or whether it has everbeen em ployed before in this sense In any case it should be pointed out that the word geno type first proposed in your own pages by Dr C Schucherte has since been used by syste 1April 23 1897 p 639 matic biologists in everincreasing number to denote the typespecies of a genus The con fusion of thought caused in the past by di verse uses of the word  type in biology must not be perpetuated hence I confidently appeal to those who want a single word for the  pure lines of Johannsen to leave  genotype alone with its usual significance and indeed to avoid any word with the syllable type in its composition It may save possibly trouble to point out that the concept of the pure line differs not only from that of the genotype as hitherto used but also from that of the genusnorm2 F A BATHER BRITISH MUSEUM N HI November 11 1910 QUOTATIONS ACADEMIC AND INDUSTRIAL EFFICIENCY Our colleges and universities have been so long under fire and in so many ways that it is truly surprising that the fundamental trouble with them has remained so long unrevealed But now thatthanks to the report made by a mechanical engineer to the Carnegie Founda tionthe light of modern industrial methods has been thrown upon them there will no longer be any excuse for their persistence in evil It may take a little time to be sure to put the new standards and ideals into effective operation but that is merely a detail The new day has dawned and the only question that remains is what institutions will be fore most in gaining the favor of farsighted and broadminded men of wealth by conforming their ways to the principles of industrial effi ciency Studenttimeunits per professor number of pages of standardized lecture notes coordination of janitorwork with teaching time and a score of other measurements of efficiency which will occur to every competent college president will take the place of those vague and intangible ways of estimating the merits of our institutions of learning that have hitherto prevailed To argue the merits of the change would be a waste of words In this age of industrial and commercial advance 2 Bather SCIENCE May 28 1897 p 844 SCIENCE 953

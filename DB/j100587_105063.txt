GREAT HUMANITY AS YOU HAVE BEEN PLEASED TO THINK THOSE FOR 1740 AND 1741 NOT UNWORTHY OF A PLACE IN YOUR PHIL TRANS THAT TREASURY OF ALL SORTS OF ERUDITION FROM THE YEAR 1741 TO 1746 WE MADE BUT FEW OBSERVATIONS FOR MY PREDECESSOR FATHER IGNATIUS KOGLER WAS THEN BROKEN WITH AGE AND I WAS WHOLLY TAKEN UP WITH LEARNING THE CHINESE LANGUAGE AND LET TERS YET POSSIBLY EVEN THESE FEW OBSERVATIONS MAY APPEAR SOME TIME OR OTHER WITH A LONG SERIES OF OTHERS WHICH THE AFORESAID FATHER MADE FROM 1718 TO 1745 AND SET DOWN IN LOOSE PAPERS WHICH I HAVE BROUGHT INTO ORDER AND WROTE INTO ONE VOLUME IN THE ORDER OF YEARS AND PLANETS AND WISH I HAD LEISURE TO TRANSCRIBE THAT VOLUME HOWEVER BOTH HE AND I WENT AS FAR AS WE COULD FOR TO SAY IT BY THE BYE THOSE BULKY MACHINES OF OUR ROYAL OBSERVA TORY HERE THO MAGNIFICENT AND OF SOLID BRASS DO NOT COME UP TO THE ACCURACY OF THE PRESENT TIME AND THE ASTRONOMICAL APPARATUS OF OUR HOUSE THAT WE CAN DEPEND UPON ALMOST INTIRELY CONSISTS OF A MICROME TER A PENDULUMCLOCK AND A TWOFOOT QUADRANT TO WHICH MAY BE ADDED A TRANSITINSTRUMENT WHICH WE HAVE RECEIVED A FEW DAYS AGO BY THE COURTESY OF DR ANTONIO RIBEYRO SANCHEZ A PORTUGUESE AND FIRST PHYSICIAN TO THE COURT OF RUSSIA TO WHICH IF A GOOD QUADRANT SUCH AS ARE MADE NOW WERE ADDED THEN WE MIGHT ATTEMPT GREATER THINGS FOR LET THE OBSERVA TIONSPHILOS TRANS VOLXLVIITABXIV P321 J MYNDE 321 TIONS MADE WITH ONLY A MICROMETER AND PENDULUM BE EVER SO ACCURATE THEY ARE RARE AND CANNOT ALWAYS BE MADE IN THE MEAN TIME WE WILL PLACE THE TRANSIT INSTRUMENT AND USE IT AS FAR AS ITS USE EXTENDS FOR A QUADRANT WE APPLY TO THE COURT OF LISBON BE CAUSE WE HAVE IT NOT IN OUR POWER OT PURCHASE ONE AND INDEED THE REPORT OF THE WEALTH OF THE JESUITS AT PEKIN IS A MERE FABLE WE HAVE NOT YET HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE HERE AT PEKIN TO SEE AN ACCURATE FIGURE OF THE MALE MUSK ANIMAL THE FIGURE HERE INCLOSED IS THAT OF THE FEMALE AND IT IS NOT THIS BUT THE MALE THAT IS SAID TO BEAR THE MUSK THIS FIGURE WAS DRAWN IN OUR HOUSE BY FATHER IGNATIUS SICHELBARTH FROM A DEAD ANIMAL AS IT WAS BROUGHT TO US THE CHINESE WHO HAVE SEEN THE MALE SAY THAT IT IS NOT MUCH UNLIKE THIS FIGURE EXCEPTING THAT IT HAS LARGER TEETH AND SOMETIMES TUSKS LIKE THOSE OF A BOAR ON SOME OTHER OCCASION WE WILL TAKE CARE TO SEND YOU ITS FIGURE IN FINE THE CHINESE CALL BOTH THE MALE AND FEMALE HIAM CHAM SU WHICH MEANS THE LITTLE ODORIFEROUS DEER DAMULA ODORIFERA WE CAREFULLY KEEP THE SYLLABUS OF OTHER THINGS OF WHICH YOU DESIRED TO BE INFORMED AND SHALL USE OUR ENDEAVOURS TO SATISFY YOU ON THESE HEADS AND ANY OTHER THAT MAY GIVE YOU PLEASURE AS TO GEOGRA PHICAL MAPS AND PLANS OF CITIES IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT AT PRESENT EITHER TO OBTAIN OR MAKE ANY BUT THOSE ALREADY PUBLISHED IN EUROPE UNTIL A MORE FAVOURABLE AIR FROM THIS COURT BREATHES ON US LAST YEAR I AND FATHER FELIX DE ROCHA TRAVELLED INTO NORTH TARTARY BEYOND THAT VAST WALL WHICH SEPA RATES OR AT LEAST SEPARATED THE CHINESE FROM THE TARTARS WHERE BY THE EMPERORS ORDER WE DREW A S S CHOROGRAPHICAL322 CHOROGRAPHICAL MAP OF THE COUNTRY INTO WHICH THIS OUR MONARCH MAKES AN EXCURSION GENERALLY EVERY THIRD YEAR IN ORDER TO TAKE THE DIVERSION OF HUNTING AND KEEP HIS COURT AND ARMY IN EXERCISE PURSUANT TO A CUSTOM ESTABLISHED BY HIS GRANDFATHER TO PRE VENT THE TARTARS FROM GROWING ENERVATED BY IDLENESS AND YET THEY DAILY GROW SO MORE AND MORE AND AS THEY ARE NOW MORE EFFEMINATE THAN THE VERY CHINESE IT IS NOT WITHOUT REASON THAT THEY ARE UNDER GREAT AP PREHENSIONS I WOULD SEND YOU GENTLEMEN A COPY OF THIS MAP IF WE HAD BEEN ALLOWED TIME ENOUGH TO MAKE IT MORE ACCURATE THE WORK WAS INDEED PLEASING TO THE EM PEROR AND UPON OUR RETURN HE GAVE US A MOST GRA CIOUS RECEPTION AND ASKED US MANY QUESTIONS CON CERNING THAT COUNTRY IT IS ONE DEGREE IN LENGTH AND ONE IN BREADTH SITUATED BETWEEN 41 30 AND 42 30 ITS WESTERN LIMIT IS IN THE SAME MERIDIAN WITH THE CITY OF PEKIN WHICH THE CHINESE TAKE FOR THE FIRST MERIDIAN BOTH IN ASTRONOMY AND GEOGRAPHY THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS ONE CONTINUED CHAIN OF MOUN TAINS AND VALLEYS WITHOUT INHABITANTS BUT FULL OF WILD BEASTS AS DEER BOARS BEARS TYGERS THE PAS SAGES OF THE VALLEYS ARE GUARDED BY TROOPS ALL AROUND AND NO BODY IS ALLOWED TO PASS THRO THEM CHINESE VOCABULARIES WHICH INTERPRET THE CHINESE WORDS IN LATIN OR ANY OTHER EUROPEAN LANGUAGE ARE VERY SCARCE AND FOR THE MOST PART VERY DEFECTIVE NOR IS THERE ANY ONE AS YET BROUGHT TO A SUFFICIENT DEGREE OF PERFECTION TO DESERVE PRINTING OR THE EX PENCES ATTENDING IT THOSE WHICH WE USE THE FIRST YEARS AFTER OUR ARRIVAL WERE EITHER LEFT BY OUR PRE DECESSORS OR WRITTEN WITH OUR OWN HANDS WITH INFINITE LABOUR323 LABOUR AND EVEN THESE ARE NOT OF ANY GREAT USE TO US EXCEPT THE FIRST TWO OR THREE YEARS TO READ AND UNDERSTAND SOME EASY BOOKS OF THE CHRISTIAN DOC TRINE COMPOSED BY OUR FATHERS FOR IN ORDER TO READ THE MORE DIFFICULT CHINESE BOOKS AND ESPECIALLY THEIR CLASSICS WE MAKE USE OF CHINESE VOCABULARIES WHICH EXPLAIN THEIR CHARACTERS AND HARD WORDS IN THE CHINESE TONGUE BUT IN A PLAIN AND EASY MANNER MUCH AS THE LATIN DICTIONARIES OF STEPHENS NIZO LIUS C IF WE COULD BE INFORMED THAT SUCH CHI NESE VOCABULARIES WOULD PROVE AGREEABLE TO YOU GEN LEMEN WE COULD EASILY SEND THEM AS TOUCHING SPECIMENS OF BUTTERFLIES INSECTS SHELLS C FATHER DINCARVILLE A FRENCHMAN IS THE MOST KNOWING AMONGST US IN THESE MATTERS AND AS HE HAS THE CARE OF SENDING SUCH THINGS TO FRANCE HE UNDER TAKES TO SEND YOU AT THE SAME TIME SPECIMENS OF WHATEVER HE CAN PROCURE AND INDEED HE SENT SOME THE LAST YEAR 1749 I AM THE ROYAL SOCIETYS IN GENERAL AND IN PAR TICULAR

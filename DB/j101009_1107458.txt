OCTOBER 1917 No 6 THE VIRGINIA INCOME TAX LAW AS APPLIED TO COR PORATIONS ENGAGED IN INTERSTATE OR FOREIGN COMMERCEITS CONSTI TUTIONALITY INTRODUCTORY The law imposing the income tax in question is Schedule D Section 10 of the tax bill as amended March 22nd 1916 and is as follows SCHEDULE D Tax on income Sec 10 As amended by act approvedMarch 22 1916 The classification under schedule D providing for the taxa tion of income shall be as follows towit The aggregate amount of income of each person or cor poration whether received or due but not received within the year next preceding the first of January in each year subject to the deductions and exemptions herein below re cited The next section although it sets out in detailthe elements of income that are subject to the tax makes no provision nor does any other part of the law make provision for an appor tionment of income for purposes of taxation in the case of cor porations only a part of whose business is done in the State of Virginia Nevertheless we understand that it is the practice of foreign corporations of this class to make an apportionment in filing their returns upon the theory they are liable for taxation on only so much of their income as accrues from business done in the State We also understand that returns showing on their face that they were made up on such a basis have in some in stances and perhaps generally been accepted by the taxing au thorities Statutes of this general class have become popular since the enactment in 1909 of the federal corporation excise tax law and3 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S of the enactment in 1913 of the federal income tax law as applied to both individuals and corporations a development that is ex plainable on the theory of suggestion as well as by considerations of expediency and convenience For instance the State of New York has such a law applicable to manufacturing and mercantile cbrporations only and which instead of providing a separate scheme from that of the federal system requires that returns made under it shall set forth the amount of income shown by the last report to the federal government The tax is based on this report with proper provision for apportionment in the case of corporations either domestic or foreign whose business is partly within the State of New York and partly elsewhere We have seen statements to the effect that Connecticut Missouri Montana and West Virginia also have laws imposing income taxes on corporations We have not examined these laws and do not know whether they follow the model of the New York statute or that of the Virginia statute The circumstance is mentioned as showing the growing popularity of this form of taxation DOES IT BURDEN INTERSTATE COMMERCE It has been suggested that this income tax law is unconstitu tional as applied to corporations engaged in interstate or foreign commerce on the theory that the tax would impose an unwar ranted burden on such interstate or foreign commerce These laws being of modern origin there is no direct prece dent in the United States Supreme Court as to their constitu tionality Questions of a very similar character however have frequently been before that court respecting both public service companies on the one hand and private manufacturing mining or mercantile companies on the other between which classes some distinction has been made DECISIONS RESPECTING PUBLIC SERVICE CORPORATIONS One of the earlier cases that has been mentioned as impugn ing the constitutionality of such an income tax is that of Phila delphia Steamship Company v Pennsylvania 122 U S 326 30 L Ed 1200 The statute there involved was a Pennsylvania law laying a tax of 810 of one per cent on the gross receipts of the company from tolls and transportations The company com 402  Oct1917  VIRGINIA INCOME TAXCONSTITUTIONALITY plaining was a Pennsylvania corporation The decision is im portant from several standpoints Dealing with the question of burden upon interstate commerce the court said The tax in the present case is laid upon the gross receipts for transportation as such Those receipts are followed and causel to be accounted for by the Company dollar for dol lar It is those specific receipts or the amount thereof which is the same thing for which the Company is called upon to pay the tax They are taxed not only because they are money or its value but because they were received for transportation This is only a small part of the discussion on this specific point which resulted in a condemnation of the statute The entire opinion may be read with profit In this opinion the court also theorized to some extent about state income tax laws and also discussed the power of a state over its own corporations their remarks on these subjects being quoted a little later herein In the case of MIeyers z Wells Fargo Express Company 223 U S 298 56 L Ed 445 there was involved an Oklahoma stat ute levying a gross revenue tax on public service corporations on the basis of gross income with an apportionment for com panies doing business partly in the State and partly outside of the State The statute was condemned the court saying p 300 The plaintiffs receipts are largely from commerce among the States and it also receives large sums as income from investments in bonds and lands all outside the State of Ok lahoma So that it is evident that if the tax is what it calls itself it is bad on the former ground and that whatever it is it is bad on the latter Fargo v Hart 193 U S 490 48 L Ed 761 Although this statute provided for an apportionment the scheme of apportionment was deemed objectionable because it included receipts from foreign investments as well as from for eign transportations On the next page the court said We may add in this connection that this requirement as to the total gross receipts shows that it is impossible to save the constitutionality of the act by construing it as referring only to the receipts from commerce wholly within the State 4033 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S On the same day that the opinion in the foregoing case was handed downv the court decilel the case of U S Express Com pany v Minnesota 223 U S 335 56 L Ed 459 where the tax imposed was a socalled property tax consisting of 6 on the gross receipts from business done wholly within the state and from the express companys portion of income derived from in terstate shipments in conjunction with other carriers the portion of the service lerformed by the U S Express Company being wholly within the State of Minnesota The validity of this law was upheld notwithstanding the fact that it imposed a tax on the State portion of an interstate shipment The courts con clusion was as follows Upon the whole we think the statute falls withinthat class where there has been an exercise in good faith of a legiti mate taxing power the measure of which taxation is in part the proceeds of interstate commerce which could not in it self be taxed and does not fall within that class of statutes uniformly condemned in this court which show a manifest attempt to burden the conduct of interstate commerce such power of course being beyond the authority of the State The court also laid a good deal of stress on the fact that the tax was in lieu of all property taxes a circumstance that is not without its bearing in the instant case where the tax not only is not in lieu of property taxes but is in addition to a heavy tax on capital employed in the state and in its application exceeds the capital tax in that the latter applies only to capital employed within the state while the income tax by its terms covers income derived from all sources The court also laid stress on the fact that no tax was levied on any part of an interstate shipment all of which was executed by one carrier saying p 341 Taxes are not claimed or collected upon shipments of express matter in the classes named where the same express com pany performs the transportation service both within and without the State of Minnesota We find it difficult to reconcile the action of the court in dis tinguishing between interstate shipments where only one carrier is involved and those involving carriage by more than one car rier the line of one of which lies wholly within the state Indeed 404  Oct1917  VIRGINIA INCOME TAXCONSTITUTIONALITY its action in this respect apparently runs directly counter to the conclusion reached by the court in the case of Galveston H and S A Railway Company v Texas 210 U S 217 52 L Ed 1031 the syllabus of which reads as follows page 1031 The state cannot impose the tax levied by Texas act of April 17 1905 upon railway companies whose lines lie wholly within the state equal to 1 per centum of their gross re ceipts where a part and in some cases much the larger part of these gross receipts is derived from the carriage of pas sengers and freight coming from or destined to points with out the state The only line of distinction between the two cases is that in the Minnesota case the tax was in lieu of a property tax while in the Texas case there was a property tax in addition In the case of Williams v Taladega 226 U S 404 57 L Ed 275 the court while recognizing the right of a municipality to levy a license tax on the Western Union Telegraph Company for the privilege of doing local business upset the particular tax law be fore it because the license tax applied to revenue from Govern ment messages as well as those from general business done in the State In the case of New York v Sohmer 235 U S 549 59 L Ed 355 the tax involved was 510 of one per cent upon gross earn ings from transportation originating and terminating within the state The validity of the law was attacked on the ground that the shipments of the company while originating in New York City and terminating at New York ports on the Hudson passed for a part of the way over New Jersey waters This view was rejected because of the doctrine that shipments beginning and terminating in the same state are intrastate commerce even if the route is partially within another state There have been many other decisions of the United States Supreme Court on these questions a clear cut review of the more important of which is found in Mr Justice Whites concurring opinion in Pullman Co v Kansas 216 U S 56 54 L Ed 378 at p 387 and in Mr Justice Harlans opinion for the court in Western Union Tel Co v Kansas 216 U S 1 54 L Ed 355 Italics ours as also in all quotations in this note unless otherwise stated 4053 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S The foregoing citations however are sufficient to give a line upon the views of the United States Supreme Court with re spect to companies whose business is itself commerce that is transportation companies telegraph companies and the like Pri vate manutfacturing and mining companies have been viewed a little differently DECISIONS RESPECTING MANUFACTURING COMPANIES From the beginning the court has not been without its ap preciation of the practical difficulties involved in following the strict logic of interstate commerce theories which explains we believe their method of deciding a great many cases almost as original propositions though they may have had many points of contact with cases previously decided For instance in the Gal veston case supra 52 L Ed at page 1037 the court said It appears sufficiently perhaps from what has been said that we are to look for a practical rather than a logical or philo sophical distinction The state must be allowed to tax the property and to tax it at its actual value as a going con cern On the other hand the state cannot tax the interstate business The two necessities hardly admit of an absolute logical reconciliation Yet the distinction is not without sense When a legislature is trying simply to value prop erty it is less likely to attempt or to effect injurious regu lation than when it is aiming directly at the receipts from interstate commerce A practical line can be drawn by tak ing the whole scheme of taxation into account That must be done by this court as best it can This attitule has been evidenced in several cases involving manufacturing companies as well as in the transportation case above referred to and other commerce company cases The case of New York v Roberts 171 U S 658 43 L Ed 323 in volved the constitutionality of a law taxing manufacturing and mercantile corporations both foreign ard domestic on the basis of capital employed in the state and granting a total exemption in favor of those corporations whose entire capital was employed in the State It was urged that much of the capital of the cor porations consisted of imlorted gools still in the original pack age and the familiar original package doctrine was invoked to defeat the tax Speaking of the case of Brown v Maryland 12 U S Express Co v Minnesota 223 U S 335 56 L Ed 459 406  Oct1917  VIRGINIA INCOME TAXCONSTITUTIONALITY Wheat 419 6 L Ed 678 which is a leading original package case the court said But that case is inapplicable Here no tax is sought to be imposed directly on imported articles or on their sale This is a tax imposed on the business of a corporation consist ing in the storage and distribution of various kinds of goods some products of their own manufacture and some imported articles From the very nature of the tax being laid as a tax upon the franchise of doing business as a corporation it cannot be affected in any way by the character of the property in which its capital stock is invested Then speaking of the Western Union Telegraph Adaims Ex press and the Pullman Car and other cases of public service cor porations the court further said It is not necessary in this case to enter into a subject so dif ficult but the cases are referred to as showing the distinc tion between corporations organized to carry on interstate commerce and having a quasipublic character and corpo rations organized to conduct strictly private business The cases of Paul v Virginia 8 Wall 168 19 L Ed 357 holding that a state may unconditionally exclude a foreign in surance company because its business is not commerce and Horn Silver Mining Company v New York 143 U S 305 36 L Ed 164 were then approved The latter case involved a similar statute of New York The distinction between public service corporations and private corporations was further developed and emphasized in the case of Baltic Mining Company v Massachusetts 231 U S 68 58 L Ed 127 This case was heard along with that of S S White Dental Manufacturing Company v Massachusetts and a single opinion delivered in the two cases Each of the dompanies was a foreign corporation with respect to the State of Massachusetts The tax involved was a franchise or excise tax imposed on for eign corporations as a condition to doing business in the state and consisted of 150 of one per cent of the par value of its authorized capital stock with a maximum limit of 2000 exigible of any one corporation in any one year The court said page 133 A resort to the receipts of property or capital employed in 407408 3 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S  Oct p rt at least in interstate commerce when such receipts or capital are not taxed as such but are taken as a mere meas ure of a tax of lawful authority within the State has beea sustained Argumentatively at least this statement favors the unconstitu tionality of the statute under investigation since the statute is in name and in fact an income tax law and is essentially a law im posing a tax on receipts as such and that too irrespective of their source whether from interstate commerce or from purely local transactions Speaking of the construction placed by the highest court of Massachusetts on the statute the court said page 134 It is held not to apply to corporations whose business is inter state commerce or who carry on interstate and intrastate business in such close connection that the intrastate business cannot be abandoned without serious impairment of the in terstate business of the corporation And the statute it is held does not apply to corporations which have places of business for the transaction solely of interstate commerce Atty Gen ex rel c v Electric Storage Battery Co 188 Mass 239 The tax is levied on the privilege of Jarryinql on business zwithin the State and not upon propely zwhich is otherwise taxed Here again emphasis is laid upon the distinction between pub lic service corporations and private corporations and also between the levying of a tax on the privilege of carrying on business and of one upon property that is otherwise taxed The court then further distinguished the cases of public service corporations and speaking of its decisions with respect to them said at page 134 In the Kansas cases the business of both complaining com panies was commerce the same instrumentalities and the same agencies carrying on in the same places the business of the companies of state and interstate character In the Western U Teleg Co case the company had a large amount of property permanently located within the state and be tween 800 and 900 offices constantly carrying on both state and interstate business The Pullman Company had been running a large number of cars within the State in state and interstate business for many years There was no attempt to separate the interstate business from the intra state business by the limitations of state lines in its prose cutions1917  VIRGINIA INCOME TAXCONSTITUTIONALITY Further distinguishing between public service and private cor porations the court continuing said In the cases at bar the business for which the companies are chartered is not of itself commerce True it is that their products are sold and shipped in interstate commerce and to that extent they are engaged in carrying on interstate com merce and are entitled to the protection of the Federal Con stitution against laws burdening commerce of this char acter Another argument in support of the tax was found in the dis tinctively local character of the business done in the state the court saying From the statement of facts it is apparent however that each of the corporations in question is carrying on a purely local and domestic business quite separate from its interstate transactions That local and domestic business for the priv ilege of doing which the State has imposed a tax is real and substantial and not so connected with interstate commerce as to render a tax upon it a burden upon the interstate busi ness of the companies involved But the statute did not tax the receipts from interstate com merce as instance In these cases the ultimate contention is not that the re ceipts from interstate commerce are taxed as suchbut that the property of the corporations including that used in such commerce represented by the authorized capital of the cor porations is taxed and therefore interstate commerce isun lawfully burdened by a State statute And again the relative lightness of the tax and the fact that though measured by the authorized capital it did not in the instant cases reach the entire capital is noticed page 135 While the tax is imposed by taking a percentage of the au thorized capital the agreed facts show that the authorized capital is only a part of the capital of the corporations respectively one of them 2500000 authorized and 10776000 actual other 1000000 authorized 5711 71829 actual assets Further the Massachusetts statute limits the tax to a maximum of 2000 Continuing the court reached conclusions that we submit are not very closely knit with the argument made by it It concluded The conclusion therefore that the authorized capital is only 409410 3 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S  Oct used as a measure of a tax in itself lawful without the neces sary effect of burdening interstate commerce brings the leg islation within the authority of the State So if the tax is as we hold it to be levied upon a legitimate subject of tax ation it is not void because imposed upon property beyond the States jurisdiction for the property itself is not taxed In so far as it is represented in the authorized capital stock it is used only as a measure of taxation and as we have seen such measure may be found in property or in receipts from property not in themselves taxable Here the court seems to have made its furthest departures from theory and legal logic in favor of supposedly practical con siderations and while on the one hand practical solutions of legal problems are in general to be commended yet too wide de partures from legal bases leave the profession somewhat at sea as to the solution of a given case The court had at an earlier period indicated the existence in its mind of a question whether an income tax could be imposed on corporations engaged in interstate commerce having said in the Philadelphia and Southern Mail Steamship case supra 122 U S 326 30 L Ed page 1024 There is another point however which may properly deserve some attention Can the tax in this case be regarded as an income tax And if it can does that make any difference as to its constitutionality We do not think that it can prop erly be regarded as an income tax It is not a general tax on the incomes of all the inhabitants of the state but a special tax on transportation companies    It is unnecessary therefore to discuss the question which would arise if the tax were properly a tax on income It is clearly not such but a tax on transportation only The corporation franchises the property the business the income of corporations created by a State may undoubt edly be taxed by the State but in imposing such taxes care should be taken not to interfere with or hamper directly or by indirection interstate or foreign commerce or any other matter exclusively wzithin the jurisdiction of the Federal Government This language anticipates numerous limitations several of which it is believed the state has overstepped RATIONALE OF APPORTIONMENT RIGHT ACCORDED TO FOREIGN CORPORATIONS As has already been stated we understand that the taxing au1917  VIRGINIA INCOME TAXCONSTITUTIONALITY thorities concede that the state has no right to impose an income tax Qn the entire income of foreign corporations only a part of whose business is done in the State and that they have accord ingly permitted such companies to make returns disclosing only the income derived from sources within the state The statute itself is as silent as the tombs on the subject of alpportionment The reason for its allowance must be sought elsewhere Presum ably the theory is that to do otherwise would exceed the states right over foreign corporations and well it may be so pre sumed for it is almost inconceivable that each of the forty eight states could impose a 1 tax on the entire earnings of a corporation like the Stanlard Oil Company and yet if any one of the fortyeight has this right so equally have all the others But it cannot be said that absence of right in the state to impose the full burden of this tax on foreign corporations arises solely or even at all because they are foreign corporations On the con trary the states power to impose conditions on as a corollary to its power to exclude foreign corporations is absolute subject only to the two limitations that such conditions shall not inter fere with interstate commnerce or with governmental agencies Pullman Company z Kansas 216 U S 56 54 L Ed 379 p 386 In the case just cited MIr Justice White in his concurring opinion quoted as follows from the case of Horn Silver Mining Co v New York 143 U S 305 36 L Ed 164 at p 67 L Ed 386 Only two exceptions or qualifications have been attached to it in all the numerous adjudications in which the subject has been considered since the judgment of this court was an nounced more than half a century ago in Bank of Augusta vz Earle 13 Pet 519 10 L Ed 274 One of these qualifi cations is that the state cannot exclude from its limits a cor poration engaged in interstate or foreign commerce estab lished by the decision in Pensacola Teleg Co v Western U Teleg Co 96 U S 1 12 24 L Ed 708 711 The other limitation on the power of the state is where the corporation is in the employ of the general governmentan obvious exception first stated we think by the late Mr Justice Brad ley in Stockton v Baltimore  N Y R Co 1 Inters Com Rep 411 32 Fed 9 14  The gist of the matter therefore lies not in any line of dis 4113 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S tinction between foreign corporations and those operating under domestic charter but in the principle that states may not inter fere with the commerce of the nation It being conceded that the state may not impose a tax on the entire income of a foreign corporation because to do so violates the commerce clause of the constitution it necessarily follows that a violation of the com merce clause may not be effected through or by means of the power of states over their own corporations This has been ex pressly held by the United States Supreme Court which in the Philadelphia Steamship case supra 122 U S 326 30 L Ed 1200 involving a Pennsylvania corporation said It certainly could not have been intended as a tax on the cor porate franchise because by the terms of the Act it was laid equally on the corporations of other states doing busi ness in Pennsylvania If intended as a tax on the franchise of doing business which in this case is the business of trans portation in carrying on interstate and foreign commerce it would clearly be unconstitutional And further on in the case the opinion reads The corporation franchises the property the business the income of corporations created by a state may undoubtedly be taxed by the state but in imposing such taxes care should be taken not to interfere with or hamper directly or by in direction interstate or foreign commerce or any other mat ter exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Federal Gov ernment So also in the Galveston case supra 210 U S 217 52 L Ed 1031 the opinion similarly states Of iourse it does not matter that the plaintiffs in error are domestic corporations or that the tax embraces indiscrim inately gross receipts from commerce within as well as out side of the state The action of the state in thus balking at exacting the full measure of the statute from foreign corporations but emphasizes the force of the view that the statute in its present form is ob noxious to the commerce clause RESUME From the foregoing citations it will be seen that the tendency 412  Oct r1917  VIRGINIA INCOME TAXCONSTITUTIONALITY of the court has been to follow the guide of practical considera tions so far as possible in preference to satisfying in all casys the strict logic of the law that a distinction has been made and frequently recognized between public service corporations and private corporations that franchise taxes otherwise untenable have been upheld where although the measure of the tax was the entire capital stock it was stated to be and was in fact in lieu of property taxes the court sometimes emphasizing in this connection the low rate of the tax that distinction has also been made between taxes imposed on corporations as a condition of their being or as a condition to doing business by foreign cor porations or socalled occupation taxes as contrasted with in come taxes applicable to individuals and to foreign and domestic corporations indiscriminately also that the application of the law to domestic corporations only does not enlarge the power of the state if the statute in question does infact impose a bur den on interstate commerce and finally that taxing schemes re garded by the courts as in fact burdening interstate commerce have in all cases been condemned In the light of these considerations the statute under investiga tion shows the following aspects in favor of its constitutionality namely a The disposition of courts generally to uphold the consti tutionality of an act where doubt on the question exists they having not infrequently sustained statutes on no more satisfac tory reasoning than upon the whole case we think the law should be sustained or words of that import U S Express Co v Minnesota 223 U S 335 56 L Ed 459 b A solution from practical rather than strictly philosophical considerations especially in view of the number of states that have followed the scheme Galveston H  S A R Co v Texas 210 U S 217 52 L Ed 1031 at p 1037 c The circumstance that the tax does not apply to companies whose business is commerce thus making the burden if any on interstate commerce less direct New York v Roberts 171 U S 658 43 L Ed 232 Baltic Mining Co v Massachusetts 231 U S 68 58 L Ed 127 d The comparative lightness of the tax as to which how 4133 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S ever there may well be difference of opinion Baltic Mining Co v Massachusetts supra e The fact that as to foreign corporations the act has been construed to cover only such proportion of their income as is derived from business done in the state This doubltess renders the act free from objection on the part of foreign corporations but may well be urged by domestic corporations as invalidating the tax in its entirety since a discrimination is thus wrought against them and their interstate commerce Philadelphia Steam ship Co v Pennsylvania 122 U S 326 30 L Ed 1200 Gal veston H  S A R Co v Texas 210 U S 217 52 L Ed 1031 at p 1038 On the other hand as showing the imlosition of a burden on interstate commerce and consequently against the constitution ality of the act may be urged a The fact that it is a direct tax on receipts as such cover ing indiscriminately what is derived from intrastate and inter state commerce Philadelphia Steamship Co v Pennsylvania 122 U S 326 30 L Ed 1200 Galveston H  S A R Co v Texas 210 U S 217 52 L Ed 1031 Meyers v WellsFargo Express Co 223 U S 298 56 L Ed 445 Baltic Mining Co v Massachusetts 231 U S 68 58 L Ed 127 b It cannot be upheld as an occupational tax or a corpora tion franchise or excise tax since it applies equally to corpora tions and individuals Philadelphia Steamship Co v Pennsyl vania 122 C S 326 30 L Ed 1200 New York v Sohmer 235 U S 549 59 L Ed 355 New York v Roberts 171 U S 658 43 L Ed 232 c It is not a property tax or in lieu of it but is in addition to property taxes and in every way bears earmarks of a genuine income tax which it is in terms designated to be Hence it is not such a tax as may be upheld on the ground that income or receipts are used merely as the gauge of a tax on a legitimate subject of taxation Baltic Mining Co v Massachusetts 231 U S 68 58 L Ed 127 U S Express Co v Minnesota 233 U S 335 56 L Ed 459 d If the tax is obnoxious on the foregoing grounds or any of them its constitutionality is not saved insofar as it affects do 414  Oct1917  VIRGINIA INCOME TAXCONSTITUTIONALITY mestic corporations If such a law as applied to foreign corpora tions is a burden on commerce it is equally so as applied to do mestic corporations Philadelphia Steamship Company v Penn sylvania 122 U S 326 30 L Ed 1200 Galveston H  S A R Co v Texas 210 U S 217 52 L Ed 1031 CONCLUSIONS While the arguments on each side of the proposition have con siderable force it is believed that the considerations that rightly may be urged against the constitutionality of the act outweigh those susceptible of being presented on the other side Furthermore the law in its present form is like the national income tax law as applied to American corporations operating abroad vicious in principle in that domestic corporations not only must pay a tax on business in which the state has had no hand but must pay a tax that is not demanded and cannot be demanded of a foreign corporation that avails of Virginias hos pitality The time was when the passage by a state of discrim inating laws in favor of its own industries was deemed the part of wisdom but laws openly favoring the outsider are an inno vation Yet neither class of laws satisfies the modern ideal the central concept of which is co6perationbetween state and na tion among the several states and between the individual and the government whether state or federal Co6peration in turn is based on what is fair and equitable It is fair and equitable that foreign and domestic corporations similarly situated should bear an equal burden of taxation It is distinctly unfair that discrim ination against the domestic corporation should be tolerated Hence the legislature in anticipation of judicial condemna tion or even irrespective of the question of constitutionality would be bringing Virginias tax system in line with constitu tional requirements and at the same time modern standards by amending the law so as to impose no heavier tax on domestic corporations than by administrative construction is exacted of foreign corporations under the law as it now stands A H BURROUGHS Nezv York N Y August 23 1917 415

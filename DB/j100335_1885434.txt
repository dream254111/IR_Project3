j100335,The Quarterly Journal of Economics,1885434,The Supply Price of Labor,i332435,NOTES AND MEMORANDA THE SUPPLY PRICE OF LABOR PROFESSOR TAUSSIG concludes his critique of my book on Profit and Wages with a significant suggestion Accepting in large part my objections to the timepreference and ab stinence theories but rejecting my theory of the supply price of labor he indicates that what we  perhaps  must come to is an  agnostic doctrine If we give up the notion of a regulating rate of timepreference or the similar one of a minimum return necessary to induce abstinence and saving we have no  normal  rate of interest And if we give up also the notion of any natural wages settled by a standard of living what have we left  Without considering the effect of these suggestions on the entire theory of distribution let us note what is implied in regard to the supply of capital and labor The importance of this factor cannot be denied All that seems to be in doubt is the possibility of a definite yet simple general theory of the factors which determine it Is not a  first approximation impracticable where so many unmeasurable forces are at work  Certainly the clearness of graphic or of mathemat ical exposition is not to be attained And yet we need not become agnostic to the extent of proclaiming a final  ignora bimus All that is necessary is to recognize that extended and patient description and analysis may make plain what cannot be expressed in the neat crisp formulae of a general theory Such probably is the feeling of a large number of econ omists In regard to the supply price of capital the classical school were by no means confident and protest against the 1 In the issue of this Journal for August 1917 400NOTES AND MEMORANDA 401 notion of supply as uniformly regulated by the rate of interest was not lacking among earlier writers A really clearcut theory of the supply price of capital is a recent development and is far from being generally accepted It seems indeed rather too obvious that the larger part of our present supply of capital is piled up without reference to a definite rate of return The conscious decision to save or not to save what Arturo Labriola jocularly refers to as the birth control of capital2 is of trifling significance In regard to the factors governing the supply of labor on the other hand there seems to be less readiness to formulate definite propositions among modern writers than among the classical school In fact the whole theory of wages is often left in vague diffuse terms while writers of a realistic cast of mind have gone so far as to deny the validity of any general theory Now contrary to the prevailing tendency I venture to argue that the formulation of a fairly brief and definite theory of the supply price of labor is a possibility and is much easier and more defensible than any corresponding formulation for capital It must however be set against a different back ground from that generally given Classical doctrine as sumed a closed economic area an isolated state or nation  legitimately enough at a time when immigration of labor and capital were inconsiderable Modern theory also presup poses a closed area or market Perhaps unconsciously it is often taken to lie within national boundaries Note for instance the term national dividend A wider range would obviously be more appropriate But any definite general formulation of the factors determining the supply price of labor such for instance as the subsistence theory of wages with its Malthusian presuppositions becomes impos sible when it is based on the idea of a closed area whether national or international Let us examine two of the conceptions underlying Ricardos subsistence theory They are first a great stability of the standard of living of the working class and second a wage at which population would remain stationary  the nat 1 Fot instance Richard Jones 2 Riforme e Rivoluzione Sociale402 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS ural price of labor Granting for the moment the truth of the first reflection on the second suggests that there is only one rate of wages which will bring forth a definite supply of labor and which can therefore be a point of equilibrium be tween the forces of demand and supply Any wage above this  natural  rate as long as it was maintained would cause a continued increase of the working population any wage below it if maintained long enough would result in a de crease of population even to the extinction of the race The labor supply called forth by any but the unique  natural rate of wages would vary therefore according to the length of time the rate in question is kept up It would set no final goal to supply Nor could any supply curve that has yet been devised picture such unstatic conditions If the supply of labor is to be thought of as a matter of population there can be no definite scale of supply prices When however the idea of such a scale is applied to different degrees of exertion or efficiency on the part of an existing population as is done by Marshall it is less open to objection altho it is obvious that the elasticity of such supply is within narrow limits It was the impossibility of maintaining the conception of a fixed standard of living which proved the stumbling block of Ricardos theory that and the slowness of any considerable change in the total supply of labor through changes in mar riage birth and death rates Not that the idea of a standard of living was given up altogether or its influence on the birth rate denied Unstable as any such standard may be it exerts an influence on the birth rate while it lasts and therefore ultimately on the supply of laborers What must be re jected is the notion that any of these temporary standards with their long delayed effects on the size of population can become a point of equilibrium for demand and supply If the conception of a cost of production for labor power is at all per missible we may argue that wages always and necessarily include a quasirent positive or negative The whole problem appears in a different light if we give up the assumption of a closed area for the play of the forces of demand and supply Just as it is permissible for economicNOTES AND MEMORANDA 403 theory to accept without explanation the operation of factors that have come down from precapitalistic times so we may accept conditions obtaining in regions outside of the capital istic when those regions are important sources of labor supply for capitalistic industry In the backward agricultural regions of Europe from which the larger part of the unskilled labor in American industries is derived there is a great fixity of standards of living To that extent the Ricardian reason ing may apply to these regions In my book on Profit and Wages I ventured the statement that  if we had only these old world conditions to consider the classical doctrine of wages adjusted to cost of subsistence might be allowed as a rough approximation of the actual forces at work It must be confessed it is a very rough one indeed But for a theory of wages applicable to modern industry it is not necessary to give a complete account of the factors determining wages in those old world noncapitalistic areas from which so much of our labor supply has come The theory of wages propounded in my book merely affirms that the scale of wages found in these noncapitalistic regions no matter what it be or how explained is part of the supply price of labor to be paid by capitalistic industry Add to that wage  a differential or premium resulting from the expenses of immigration and perhaps the deterrent effect of distance and unfamiliarity  to borrow Professor Taussigs phraseology and we have the complete supply price for unskilled labor The larger the supply desired the greater must be the premium The familiar curve representing supply subject to increasing cost is applicable Moreover an increase of supply through immi gration can come about as quickly as an increase of demand due to growth of capital An equilibrium between demand and supply may be reached and static theory comes to its own For higher grades of labor the starting point of the supply price is the wages paid to the unskilled To this must be added a premium to induce development out of the lower grade into the higher But there the explanation becomes somewhat tenuous and theory may do less violence to the facts if it assume the supply of the higher grades as fixed404 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS To countries with a small influx of immigrants such as Great Britain and Germany this theory may appear alto gether inapplicable The question however is whether they have within their own boundaries precapitalistic areas of low and stable standards of living and of wages determined inde pendently of capitalistic industry To some extent this is still true tho it must be admitted that such regions are rapidly losing their old time character The precapitalistic areas of Great Britain and Germany and indeed those of Europe generally are becoming merged into the modern industrial system Perhaps soon they will be too inconsider able to be regarded as sources of a marginal supply of labor Then my theory of the supply price of labor will be with out support in fact I concede prophetic truth to Professor Taussigs judgment that the outcome of my reasoning about the supply of labor and of capital is that of an impassive unregulated impact  between them with no  normal  re turn for either wages or the profit of capital G A KLEENE TRINITY COLLEGE HARTFORD CONN

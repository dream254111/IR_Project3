j101009,The Virginia Law Register,1100727,Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Appeals Sec 3455 Va Code 1904,i245929,1048 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER March CORRESPONDENCE JURISDICTION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF APPEALSSEC 3455 VA CODE 1904 To the Editors of Virginia Law Register In investigating recently the changes made in the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals by the Constitution of 1902 I find that the annotations to sec 3455 of the Code fail to note two changes which seem to me to be of sufficient importance to deserve attention In the cases of Prison Association v Ashby 93 Va 367 Price v Smith 93 Va 14 Barnett v Meredith 10 Gratt 650 Page v Clopton 30 Gratt 415 and Gresham v Newell 84 Va 784 the court held that see 2 Art 6 of the Constitution of 1869 did not proprio tigore confer jurisdiction upon the court but that it simply in vested the court with capacity to receive jurisdiction in the enumerated cases in the event that the legislature saw fit to confer it The doctrine of these cases is given on page 1838 of the Code of 1904 but no mention is made of the effect thereon of see 88 of the Constitution of 1902 That section provides  Subject to such reasonable rules as may be prescribed by law as to the course of the appeal the limitation as to time the security required if any the granting or refusing of appeals and the procedure therein it shall by virtue of this Constitution have appellate jurisdiction in all cases involvinig the constitutionality of a law as being repugnant to the Constitution of this State or of the United States or involving the life or liberty of any person and it shall also have appellate jurisdition in such other cases withlin the limits hereinafter defined as may be prescribed by law From this language it seems clear that the present Constitution does proprio myore confer appellate jurisdiction upon the Supreme Court in all cases involv ing the constitutionality of a law or the life or liberty of a person In all other cases the rule seems to remain as before In the case of Price v Smith above the court says This section 3455 prohibits an appeal    where the judgment or decree is for a matter less in value than five hundred dollars unless there be drawn in question a freehoid or franchise or the title or bounds of land or some other matter not merely pecu niary The words or some matter not merely pecuniary which appear in the Act are not found in the Constitution Art 6 sec 2 1869 hence those words as used in the statute mean only such  matters not merely pecuniary as are enumerated in the Constitution A reference to the present Constitution sec 88 will show that the words or some other matter not merely pecuniary are used in connection with and iinme diately after the enumerated matters in the Constitution so that now sec 3455 of the Code and sec 88 of the Code are in entire consonance In accordance with the rule in such cases therefore it would appear that under the present law if a judgment or decree involves any matter not merely pecuniary whether one of the matters enmbraced in the constitution or not an appeal will lie irre spective of the amount involved and that in this respect also the decision in Price v Smith is superseded Richmond Va Feb 24 1905 W M JUSTIS JR

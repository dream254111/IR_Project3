J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1012895,THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF MARKETING,I242644,THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF MARKETING BY SELDEN O MARTIN HARVARD UNIVERSITY CAMBRIDGE MASSACHUSETTS THE WORDS SCIENTIFIC AND PRINCIPLES ARE MUCH HEARD IN BUSINESS TODAY IN ITS PRACTICE AND ESPECIALLY IN ITS TEACHING SOME YEARS AGO IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN PROPER TO DISCUSS THE POSSIBILITY OF TEACHING BUSINESS AND THE EXISTENCE OF PRINCIPLES IN BUSINESS TIME HAS ANSWERED BOTH QUERIES BUSINESS IS BEING TAUGHT AND PRINCIPLES OF BUSINESS ARE BEING DISCLOSED BUSINESS PRINCIPLES ARE SOMETIMES CONFUSED WITH BUSINESS SAWS EARLY TO BED AND EARLY TO RISE AND SAVE YOUR PENNIES OR EVEN GOODS WELL BOUGHT ARE HALF SOLD COULD BY NO STRETCH OF THE IMAG INATION BE CALLED BUSINESS PRINCIPLES IN THE SCIENTIFIC SENSE OF THE WORD PRINCIPLE SCIENTIFIC CONNOTES A BASIS OF ORGANIZED KNOWLEDGE AND PRINCIPLE CONNOTES AT LEAST A FAIRLY DEFINITE RELATION BETWEEN ANTECEDENTS AND RESULTS ON THE OTHER HAND SUCH GENERALIZATIONS ASTHE NEARER AN INVENTORY IS TO ITS RAW MATERIAL STAGE THE BETTER BASIS OF CREDIT IT IS OR WHEN STOCKTURNS ARE FEWER DEPRECIATION COST IS APT TO BE GREATERARE NEARER OUR UNDERSTANDING OF PRINCIPLES WHEN ENOUGH PRECEDENTS OF MARKETING ARE ACCUMULATED TO SHOW THAT WITH SOME FACTS ASCERTAINED AS TO WHETHER AN ARTICLE IS A SPE CIALTY OR A STAPLE WHAT ITS UNIT OF SALE IS WHAT ITS CAPACITY FOR REPEAT ORDERS IS AND SO ON CERTAIN BROAD POLICIES AS TO THE METHODS OF MARKETING THIS ARTICLE CAN BE LAID DOWN THEN CERTAINLY AN APPROACH IS BEING MADE TO AN ORGANIZED BODY OF KNOWLEDGE AND IF IT IS POSSIBLE TO GO STILL FURTHER IN THE FIELD OF MARKETING AND IN THE DIVI SION KNOWN AS RETAILING SHOW BY INDUCTIVE STUDY THAT ONE OF THE FIRST ROUGH TESTS OF EFFICIENCY IN A RETAIL STORE IS THE ANNUAL SALES OF THE AVERAGE SALESPERSON AND STILL FURTHER ESTABLISH THAT AT PRESENT IN THE RETAIL SHOE BUSINESS IN A CITY OF MORE THAN 100000 POPULATION THIS ANNUAL AVERAGE SHOULD BE ABOUT 10000 AND FURTHERMORE THAT THE RENT SHOULD NOT EXCEED 5 PER CENT AND CAN BE REDUCED TO AT LEAST 3 PER CENT OF THE NET SALES THEN INDEED THERE IS BEING PROVIDED A STILL MORE DEFINITE BODY OF KNOWLEDGE FROM WHICH PRINCIPLES CAN BE ESTABLISHED 77THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY THE TWO GREAT DIVISIONS OF BUSINESS ARE THE MAKING OF THINGS AND THE BUYING AND SELLING OF THINGS THESE ARE THE CENTRAL ACTIVI TIESPRODUCTION AND MARKETING THE OTHER FUNCTIONS OF BUSINESS FOR EXAMPLE ACCOUNTING BANKING TRANSPORTATION INSURANCE ARE FUNCTIONS AUXILIARY TO THESE CENTRAL ACTIVITIESIMPORTANT MOST IMPORTANT BUT AUXILIARY IN THE FIELD OF PRODUCTION OF COURSE THE BODY OF KNOWLEDGE IS ON THE WHOLE BETTER ORGANIZED AND MORE PRECISE THE VARIOUS SYSTEMS OF MANAGEMENT RELATE MORE TO PRODUCTION THAN TO MARKETING THOUGH A VAST FIELD FOR RESEARCH MARKETING HAS HAD COMPARATIVELY LITTLE SCIENTIFIC STUDY IT HAS NOT SEEMED PARTICULARLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO SCIENTIFIC STUDY IT ABOUNDS IN THE HUMAN EQUATION THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT MUCH ABILITY HAS NOT BEEN EXPENDED ON THIS FIELD NOT ONLY IN STUDYING AND INCITING DEMAND BUT ALSO IN RECORDING PERFORMANCE MAP AND TACK SYSTEMS QUOTAS AND BONUSES SELLING COSTS AND CAREFULLY PREPARED STATISTICS OF VARIOUS KINDS HAVE FOR A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD BEEN EMPLOYED BY THE MOST PROGRESSIVE SELLING ORGANIZATIONS THESE INTERNAL STATISTICS HAVE ALSO BEEN ACCOM PANIED BY EXTERNAL STATISTICS AFFECTING AND REFLECTING MARKET CONDITIONS BUT IN THE LAST ANALYSIS THE FIGURES FINALLY USED IN MARKETING HOWEVER OBTAINED ARE BASED ON THE LAW OF AVERAGES FREQUENCY OR PROPORTION THE STANDARDS SET NO MATTER HOW CAREFULLY AND SPECIFICALLY ADJUSTED ARE IN THE LAST ANALYSIS AVERAGES MODES OR PROPORTIONS AND APPLY EN MASSE RATHER THAN IN DETAIL AGAIN THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT THESE DATA ARE NOT REGARDED AS MOST VALUABLE AS INDEED THE LATER STATEMENT OF RESEARCH WORK WILL SHOW A GREAT PROBLEM IN MARKETING IS TO GET DOWN BENEATH THE LAW OF AVERAGES AND TYPES PRODUCTION IS SO MUCH MORE SPECIALIZED AND STANDARD IZED SO MUCH MORE PRECISE THAN MARKETING THAT IT IS POSSIBLE GIVEN CERTAIN FACTS OF MATERIAL DIMENSION AND DESIGN TO SET A MAXIMUM TIME FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF ACERTAIN SPECIFIC OPERATION THE APPLIERS OF SCIENTIFIC MANAGEMENT HAVE FURTHERMORE SHOWN THE POS SIBILITY OF DETERMINING A MINIMUM TIME FOR THIS OPERATION WITH CON DITIONS CONTINUING THE SAME AND OF PRESCRIBING THE MEANS WHEREBY THIS MINIMUM TIME NEED NOT BE EXCEEDED IN OTHER WORDS THE SCIENTIFIC MANAGER IN PRODUCTION CAN NOT ONLY TELL WILLIAM JONES HOW LONG HE SHOULD BE IN MACHINING A CERTAIN PART BUT CAN FURNISH HIM WITH THE BEST FEEDS AND SPEEDS TO EMPLOY IN DOING THE WORK IN THE TIME SPECIFIED AND IF THE METHODS AND TIME APPLY IN PHILADELPHIA 78THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF MARKETING IT IS PRESUMED THAT THEY WILL ALSO APPLY IN BOSTON BUT IN MARKET ING NO MANAGER NO MATTER HOW ABLE AND EXPERIENCED WOULD AT TEMPT TO TELL THOMAS SMITH HOW LONG HE SHOULD BE IN SELLING A PAIR OF SHOES TO WILLIAM JONES NOR TO GIVE MORE THAN GENERAL IN STRUCTIONS AS TO THE BEST WAY IN WHICH TO DO THE SELLING ABOUT THE BEST THIS MANAGER HAS BEEN ABLE TO DO IS TO SAY THAT IN A WEEK ON THE AVERAGE AND ACCORDING TO THE SEASON THOMAS SMITH SHOULD SELL SO MANY DOLLARS WORTH OF SHOES IN MACHINING THE PART THE CONDITIONS ARE MORE STANDARDIZED THE OPERATION MORE SPECIALIZED THE HUMAN FACTOR IS LESS AND IS MORE UNDER CONTROL IN SELLING THE SHOES THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE IN PRODUCTION THE TIME FOR AN OPERATION CAN BE MEASURED BY MINUTES AND LESS IN MARKETING I HAVE ENCOUN TERED NO PRACTICAL USE BEING MADE OF UNITS OF LESS THAN ONE WEEK THIS WARRANTS THE CONSIDERATION FOR A MOMENT OF CERTAIN FUNDA MENTAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PRODUCTION AND MARKETING BRINGING OUT WHY IN BUSINESS SOME MEN GROW UP ON THE SELLING SIDE AND SOME ON THE MANUFACTURING SIDE THESE DIFFERENCES MAY BE BALANCED AGAINST EACH OTHER AS FOL LOWS IN PRODUCTION MEN MEET ONLY AS MEMBERS OF THE BUSINESS AS SUBORDINATES PEERS OR SUPERIORS NEITHER THE CUSTOMER NOR THE COMPETITOR IS ENCOUNTERED DIRECTLY IN MARKETING ON THE OTHER HAND MEN ARE IN CONTACT NOT ONLY WITH THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE BUSINESS BUT ALSO WITH THE CUSTOMER TO SERVE AND THE COMPETITOR TO MEET IN PRODUCTION THE PROBLEMS ARE LIKELY TO BE MORE THOSE OF COST MATERIAL LABOR AND OVERHEAD IN MARKETING THE ATTENTION IS MORE FOCUSSED ON PRICE KNOWLEDGE OF COST IS NOT PARTICULARLY ESSENTIAL THE MARKET IS FIXING VALUES OUTSIDE OF THE BUSINESSES CONTROL EMPHASIS IS ALSO LIKELY TO BE LAID ON QUALITY AND SERVICE IN PRODUCTION THE PROBLEMS ON THE WHOLE ARE INTERNAL IN MARKETING THE PROBLEMS ON THE WHOLE ARE EXTERNAL COMPETITION IN ALL THE FOREGOING THE DIFFERENCES CITED ARE MORE DIFFERENCES IN LARGE DEGREE THAN NARROWLY IN KIND FOR EXAMPLE TIME STUDIES ARE THEMSELVES USUALLY MODES OR AVERAGES OR BOTH AND ALLOWANCES HAVE TO BE MADE ACCORDING TO THE CHARACTER OF LABOR OF A COMMUNITY AND IN MARKETING ON THE OTHER HAND THE PRACTICE IN LARGE MARKETS OF HAVING SALESMEN SAY NOTHING ABOUT THE GOODS BUT SIMPLY ANSWER AND SERVE AND THE ABOLITION OF THE SALES SLIP IN THE 5 AND 10 CENT STORE ARE STEPS TOWARD PRODUCTION METHODS IN MARKETING DESPITE THESE THEORETICAL SIMILARITIES THE DIFFERENCES IN FACT IN OPERATION AND RESULT BETWEEN PRODUCTION AND MARKETING ARE AS STATED 79THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY IS ON EVERY HAND THE MARKET IS TO BE ANALYZED IN PRODUCTION THERE IS PROBABLY FOR THE INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS A POSSIBILITY OF GREATER INDEPENDENCE OF ACTION MARKETING IS PROBABLY MORE HEDGED ABOUT BY THE CUSTOMS OF THE TRADE IN OTHER WORDS AS SAID BEFORE MAR KETING ABOUNDS IN THE HUMAN EQUATION ANOTHER ILLUSTRATION OF THESE DIFFERENCES CAN BE TAKEN OUT OF THE SHOE INDUSTRY FROM THE MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING SIDES RESPECT IVELY IN THE MANUFACTURE OF SHOES IN GENERAL THE UNIT OF MEASURE EMPLOYED IN DETERMINING THE OUTPUT OF THE WORKMAN IS THE PAIR OR MULTIPLES OF THE PAIR THAT IS A PHYSICAL UNIT A QUANTITATIVE UNIT IS EMPLOYED IN THE MARKETING OF SHOES WHOLESALE OR RETAIL IN GENERAL THE UNIT OF MEASURE EMPLOYED IN DETERMINING THE OUTPUT OF THE SALESMAN IS THE DOLLAR THE VALUE OF THE SALES THAT IS A UNIT OF VALUE A QUALITATIVE UNIT IS EMPLOYED IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED HOWEVER THAT THE PROPER UNIT ON WHICH TO CALCULATE THE RETAIL SALESMANS EFFICIENCY AND WAGES AS WELL AS OTHER EXPENSE IS ALSO THE PAIR AND THIS HAS BEEN FURTHER SUPPLEMENTED BY ONE WITH EXPERIENCE IN PRODUCTION WHO SAYS THAT MARKETING IS BUT A CONTINUATION OF PRO DUCTION ONLY WITH THE ADDITION OF UTILITIES MORE IN THE NATURE OF PLACE AND SERVICE THAN OF FORM AND THAT THE STORE SALESMAN MAKES SALES JUST AS THE FACTORY WORKER MAKES SHOES THE TEST OF EFFICIENCY OF THE SALESMAN HE SAYS IS THE NUMBER OF SALES JUST AS THE TEST OF THE EFFICIENCY OF THE FACTORY WORKER IS THE NUMBER OF PAIRS AND WHEN ASKED IF SALESMAN A SELLING 15 PAIRS OF 3 SHOES OR 45 WORTH WERE MORE EFFICIENT THAN SALESMAN B SELLING 10 PAIRS OF 5 SHOES OR 50 WORTH IN THE SAME PERIOD AT ONCE ANSWERED YES THE TRUE ANSWER IS THAT IN THE LAST ANALYSIS PROBABLY BOTH THE WORKER AND THE SALESMAN ARE PAID ACCORDING TO THE VALUE CONTRIBUTED BY EACH TO THE SHOES ONLY THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE WORKER TO EACH PAIR CAN BE SO EXACTLY MEASURED THAT THE PAIR AND MULTIPLES OF THE PAIR BECOME THE MORE CONVENIENT ACCOUNTING UNIT BUT THE SALES MANS OPERATION HAS NOT BEEN SO STANDARDIZED GREETING THE CUS TOMER LEARNING HIS WANTS FINDING THE SHOE FITTING THE SHOE CLOSING THE SALE STARTING THE ACCOUNTING ON THE SALE AND THE DELIVERY OF THE GOODS ARE A WHOLE SERIES OF OPERATIONS MORE COMPLEX THAN SKIVING A SHANK OR NAILING A LIFT FURTHERMORE IN THE LATTER OPERATIONS THE MATERIAL AND THE MACHINE HAVE NO PERSONALITYTHE OPERATOR ONLY WHEREAS IN THE CASE OF THE SALESMAN THERE IS NOT ONLY THE UNKNOWN 80THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF MARKETING QUANTITY OF THE PERSONALITY OF THE CUSTOMER TO RECKON WITH BUT ALSO THE UNKNOWN INTERACTION OF THE TWO PERSONALITIES SO FOR THE OP ERATIONS OF THE SALESMAN THE DOLLAR WHICH IN ITSELF IS A COMMON DENOMINATOR BECOMES THE MORE CONVENIENT ACCOUNTING UNIT AND THIS VERY DIFFERENCE IN UNITS BRINGS OUT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY THE DIFFER ENCE BETWEEN PRODUCTION AND MARKETING SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH THEN IN MARKETING IS EVIDENTLY NOT AN EASY TASK ESPECIALLY IF SCIENTIFIC BE GIVEN THE SAME STRICT DEFINITION THAT IT HAS IN PRODUCTION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SUBJECT MARKETING HOWEVER THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION AS A FEW FACTS WILL SHOW FORTY PER CENT OF THE PRICE PAID BY THE ULTIMATE CONSUMER FOR A PAIR OF SHOES IS CONSUMED IN GETTING THE SHOES TO HIM FROM THE MANUFACTURER EXCLUSIVE OF THE MANUFACTURERS PROFIT THAT IS IN MARKETING THEM FOR LESS STAPLE COMMODITIES THIS PERCENTAGE IS YET HIGHER AND EVEN ON SO STAPLE A COMMODITY AS GROCERIES THE MARKETING MARGIN RANGES FROM TWENTYFIVE TO FORTY PER CENT THE IDEA IS NOT THAT THIS MARGIN IS EITHER PROPER OR IMPROPER BUT SIMPLY THAT IT IS A PREGNANT SUBJECT TO INVESTIGATE IT ACCORDINGLY WAS IN THE FIELD OF MARKETING THAT THE HARVARD BUREAU OF BUSINESS RESEARCH SET TO WORK IT DECIDED TO WORK BY COMMODITIES AND FOR THE FIRST COMMODITY SELECTED SHOES AS A STAPLE REGULARLY MARKETED BY VARIOUS METHODSMANUFACTURER TO WHOLE SALER TO RETAILER TO CONSUMER MANUFACTURER TO RETAILER TO CON SUMER MANUFACTURER TO CONSUMER DIRECTLY BY MAIL OR THROUGH OWNED RETAIL STORES IN THE MARKETING OF SHOES THE DIVISION RETAIL ING WAS BEGUN THE FIRST CONCRETE TASK WAS TO ASCERTAIN THE COST OF RETAILING BY SECURING AS MANY INDIVIDUAL RETAIL COSTS AS POSSI BLE DEARTH OF ADEQUATE RECORDS IN MANY RETAIL SHOE STORES AND VARIATIONS IN BOOKKEEPING IN ALL OF THEM NECESSITATED THE DRAFTING OF A UNIFORM ACCOUNTING SYSTEM WHICH HAS BECOME STANDARD IN THE SHOE TRADE THUS WAS THE ACCOUNTING VARIANT REMOVED THE GREAT PROBLEM HAS BEEN OF COURSE TO REMOVE AS MANY VARIANTS AS POSSIBLE AND GET THE MARKETING UNITS ON AS NEAR A COMPARABLE BASIS AS POSSIBLE THAT IS TO APPLY THE STANDARDIZATION OF PRODUCTION SO FAR AS APPLICABLE WITH THE RECORDS OF FIRST 130 AND THEN 650 STORES ADJUSTED TO THIS SYSTEM IT HAS BEEN POSSIBLE TO PREPARE NORMAL AND STANDARD FIGURES SOME OF WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN REFERRED TO THE MORE 81THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY IMPORTANT FIGURES WERE SUMMARIZED IN THE BUREAUS BULLETIN NUM BER 1 AS FOLLOWS SUMMARY TABLE OF IMPORTANT FIGURES FROM THE RETAIL SHOE BUSINESS NET SALES 100 PER CENT PERCENTAGE ABOUT LOWEST HIGHEST PERCENTAGE ABOUT WHICH WHICH A CONCENTRA ITEMPERCENTAGE PERCENTAGE DATA CENTRE NOT AN TION IS SUFFICIENT PERCENTAGE

TWO COLUMNS MODES FOR THESE FIGURES NOT AVERAGES THE THIRD COLUMN CONTAINS THE MODE FOR THE WHOLE GROUP AND THE FOURTH COLUMN THE MODE FOR AN EFFICIENT GROUP LARGE ENOUGH TO BE SIGNIFICANT THE THIRD COLUMN THEN MAY BE SAID TO PROVIDE A NORMAL FIGURE AND THE FOURTH COLUMN A STANDARDSOMETHING TO AIM FOR THAT THESE FIGURES HAVE SERVED AS STANDARDS FOR SHOE RETAILERS RESULTING IN REDUCTION OF EXPENSE THE BUREAU HAS CONCRETE INSTANCES THIS IS NOT HARD TO UNDER STAND WHEN IT IS REMEMBERED THAT PROBABLY NEVER BEFORE HAVE THE GREAT MAJORITY OF SHOE RETAILERS HAD ANY CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE IF THEIR RENT AMOUNTED TO 7 PER CENT OF THEIR NET SALES THAT IT SHOULD BE 5 PER CENT AND COULD BE 3 PER CENT IN CITIES OF OVER 100000 POPULATION 82THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF MARKETING OR THAT MORE THAN 8 PER CENT OF THE NET SALES IS TOO MUCH TO PAY FOR SALESFORCE EXPENSE AS DEFINED BY THE HARVARD SYSTEM OF ACCOUNTS FOR SHOE RETAILERS IT IS FURTHERMORE EVIDENT THAT THERE ARE VARIATIONS IN THE OPERATING EXPENSE OF RETAIL SHOE STORES OF NEARLY 100 PER CENT 1835 PRELIMINARY STUDIES OF THE RETAILING OF OTHER COMMODITIES ESPECIALLY GROCERIES HARDWARE CLOTHING AND DRUGS INDICATE PRACTICALLY AS WIDE A VARIATION JUST HOW FAR SOCIETY AS REPRESENTED BY THE CONSUMER IS BENEFITED BY INCREASED RETAIL EFFICIENCY IT IS HARD TO SAY BUT IT DOES SEEM FROM OBSERVATION IN THE RETAIL SHOE TRADE THAT A PART OF THE SAVING IN EXPENSE GOES TO THE CONSUMER IN REDUCED PRICES EVEN IF THE CONSUMER DOES NOT BENEFIT FOR THE STOCK OF CAPITAL OF SOCIETY AS A WHOLE IT IS BETTER TO HAVE THIS SAVING GO INTO THE RETAILERS PROFIT THAN TO HAVE IT LARGELY CONSUMED IN MARKETING FRICTION WITH STILL FURTHER DATA OBTAINED FROM SHOE RETAILERS THE BUREAU EXPECTS FURTHER TO CLASSIFY AND REFINE THE ABOVE FIGURES TO DETECT THE INFLUENCE IF POSSIBLE OF THE IMPORTANT FACTORS OF THE POPULATION OF THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH THE STORE MAY BE LOCATED THE GRADE OF BUSINESS OF THE STORE AND ITS VOLUME OF BUSINESS AT THE SAME TIME THE RESEARCH IS BEING PUSHED BACK TO THE SHOE WHOLESALERS AND THE SHOE MANUFACTURERS WITH OR WITHOUT STOCK DEPARTMENTS ALSO WITHIN A YEAR AN INVESTIGATION OF THE MARKETING OF GROCERIES HAS BEEN BEGUN IN A WAY GENERALLY SIMILAR TO THE SHOE STUDY AND ALREADY THOUGH THE SAME ACCOUNTING SYSTEM IS BEING EMPLOYED CONDITIONS STRIKINGLY DIFFERENT IN THE RETAILING OF THESE TWO COMMODITIES HAVE BEEN FOUND SOME REFERENCE TO THOSE RELATING TO STOCKTURN AND DEPRECIATION COST WILL APPEAR SHORTLY IN A BULLETIN ON DEPRECIATION IN MERCANTILE BUSINESSES WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE RETAIL SHOE BUSINESS COSTS ARE NOT THE ONLY SUBJECT OF STUDY IN FACT IT MIGHT BE SAID THAT JUST AS THE ACCOUNTING SYSTEM WAS AN INCIDENTAL NECESSITY TO THE SECURING OF COSTS SO THE COSTS ARE AN INCIDENTAL NECESSITY TO THE SECURING OF THE BEST PRACTICE WHAT FOR EXAMPLE IS THE BEST RETAIL SHOE PRACTICE SHOULD A SHOE RETAILER BUY FROM MORE OR FEWER SOURCES SHOULD THESE SOURCES BE MANUFACTURERS OR WHOLESALERS OR BOTH HOW MUCH STOCK SHOULD HE CARRY AND HOW SHOULD HE DETER MINE IT IN OTHER WORDS CANNOT SHOE RETAILING BE MADE MORE SCIENTIFIC AND ECONOMICAL AND HOW CAN IT BE MADE SO SIMILAR WORK WILL BE DONE WITH THE WHOLESALER AND OTHER AGENCIES 83THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF MARKETING AND EVENTUALLY WITH NOT ONLY SHOE AND GROCERIES BUT WITH OTHER COMMODITIES2 BUT AFTER ALL THE MATERIAL THAT HAS SO FAR BEEN OBTAINED AND IS SO FAR BEING SOUGHT BY THE BUREAU IS REALLY MODES WHETHER OF SPECIFIC FIGURES OR OF GENERAL PRACTICE THE BUREAUS SCHEDULE FOR SHOE RE TAILERS STATES THAT APART FROM THE FIGURES DESIRED THE OBJECT OF THE GENERAL QUESTIONS IS TO BRING OUT THE CHARACTER EXPERIENCE POLICIES AND TENDENCIES OF EACH STORE THE MODE OF THE PRACTICES OF STORES WITH THE MOST EFFICIENT RECORDS WOULD BE THE BEST PRACTICE FURTHER MORE THESE MODES ARE BASED ON A UNIT OF TIME OF NOT LESS THAN SIX MONTHS AND FREQUENTLY A YEAR IS A STILL SOUNDER FOUNDATION AND ALTHOUGH A STANDARD SO BASED CAN BE APPLIED BEFORE THE RESULTS IT IS MEASURING ARE SIX MONTHS OLD STILL A CONSIDERABLE LAPSE OF TIME IS NECESSARY BEFORE FRUITFUL COMPARISON CAN BE ASSURED IN OTHER WORDS THE BUREAU LIKE THE ADVANCED SELLING ORGANIZA TIONS IS STILL DEALING WITH AVERAGES AND TYPES ALTHOUGH THROUGH ITS NONCOMPETITIVE CONFIDENTIAL POSITION IT HAS ACCESS TO A MUCH GREATER VARIETY OF EXPERIENCE THIS WORK IS WORTH WHILE IT CAN EVEN BE CALLED SCIENTIFIC IN THE SENSE THAT IT IS CONSTRUCTING AN ORGANIZED BODY OF KNOWLEDGE BUT IT IS BY NO MEANS SCIENTIFIC TO THE DEGREE OF THE SCIENTIFIC MANAGEMENT OF PRODUCTION HOW FAR CAN THE SCIENTIFIC MANAGEMENT OF PRODUCTION BE APPLIED TO MARKETING IN PRODUCTION THE GREAT FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM IS TO DETERMINE THE PROPER TASK THE STORING THE ROUTING THE GREATER STANDARDIZATION THE TIME STUDIES THE IMPROVED METHODS AND PROC ESSES ALL RELATE FUNDAMENTALLY TO THE TASK AND THIS TASK ONCE DETER MINED CAN BE DEFINITELY RECKONED ON AS LONG AS THE CONDITIONS REMAIN UNCHANGED AND THESE CONDITIONS EITHER DO NOT CHANGE OR IF THEY DO THEIR CHANGE CAN BE MEASURED AND ALLOWED FOR SIMILARLY IN MARKETING TASKS ARE BEGINNING TO BE SEARCHED FOR AND SET BUT A VERY MUCH LONGER UNIT OF TIME IS NECESSARY AND THE GIVEN CONDITIONS CHANGE AND THE CHANGE AND ITS EFFECT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE IF THE BUREAU WERE TO PURSUE THE METHODS OF SCIENTIFIC MANAGEMENT IN EXACT ANALOGY IT WOULD TAKE COMPLETE CHARGE OF A SHOE STORE MEASURE EVERY DIMENSION KEEP CAREFUL RECORDS OF STOCK 2 FURTHER MATERIAL OF THE HARVARD BUREAU OF BUSINESS RESEARCH WILL BE FOUND IN ITS OWN BULLETINS 14 AND SOME ACCOUNT OF IT HAS ALSO APPEARED IN THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW OF DECEMBER 1913 AND IN PAPERS AND PROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERI CAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION MARCH 1915 84THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF MARKETING AND SALES OF SALESMEN AND CUSTOMERS CORRELATE THE SELLING MORE WITH BUYING MAKE THE BEST SELLING STOCK MOST ACCESSIBLE TO THE FEWEST STEPS TAKE TIME STUDIES OF SALES TO VARIOUS CUSTOMERS AND SO ON AS A RESULT IT MIGHT REDESIGN AND RELOCATE THE STORE AND CHANGE ITS BUYING AND SELLING METHODS MUCH COULD BE DONE MUCH COULD BE LEARNED HOW MUCH WOULD THAT KNOWLEDGE APPLY TO ANOTHER STORE AND HOW MUCH TO THE SAME STORE A YEAR LATER WHAT SPECIALIZATION AND STANDARDIZATION ARE POSSIBLE IN MAR KETING HOW FAR CAN THE EXPERIENCE OF ONE SECTION BE APPLIED TO THE METHODS OF ANOTHER HOW MUCH OF THE MARKETING PROBLEM IS HUMAN AND HOW MUCH OF THIS HUMAN FACTOR IS DETERMINABLE AND MEASURABLE MUST MARKETING ALWAYS HAVE ITS PRACTICE GUIDED BY GENERAL DATA AVERAGES MODES PROPORTIONSMASS PHENOMENA WHAT REORGANIZATION IS DESIRABLE AND POSSIBLE IN THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF MARKETING OR IS A NEW SYSTEM DEVELOPING THESE ARE ABSORBING QUESTIONS SOCIETY HAS PERMITTED A LARGE MARGIN FOR MARKETING COST AND NOW SOCIETY IS INVESTIGATING TO SEE HOW THIS MARGIN IS USED HERE IS A TREMENDOUS FIELD FOR RESEARCH ITS POTENTIALITIES ARE HARD TO OVERESTIMATE 85

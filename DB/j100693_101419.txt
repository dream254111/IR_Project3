MEDITERRANEAN,I206866,41 A RELATION OF THE ADVICE GIVEN BY MONSIEUR PETIT INTENDANT OF THE FORTIFICATIONS OF NORMANDY TOUCHING THE CONJUNCTION OF THE OCEAN AND MEDITERRANEAN THIS INTELLIGENT GENTLEMAN MONSIEUR PETIT HAVING BEEN CONSULTED WITH TOUCHING THE CONJUNCTION OF THE OCEAN AND MEDITERRANEAN DELIVERS FIRST THE PROPOSITION AND THEN GIVETH HIS THOUGHTS UPON IT THE PROPOSITION IS THAT THERE BEING ABOUT TWO LEAGUES BE LOW CASTRES IN LANGUEDOC A RIVOLET CALLED SOR PASSING TO RE VEL THERE MAY BY THE MEANS THEREOF BE MADE A COMMUNICATION OF THE TWO SEAS BY JOYNING THE WATERS OF THIS RIVOLET BY A CHANNEL TO BE KEPT FULL ALL THE YEAR LONG WITH THOSE OF ST PAPOUL AND OTHERS WHICH FALL INTO FRESQUEIL ANOTHER SMALL RIVER THAT RUNS INTO THE AUDE BELOW CARCASSONE AND GO TOGE THER TO NARBONNESITUATED UPON THE MEDITERRANEAN HAVING GIVEN THE PROPOSITION HE ADDS SOME PARTICULARS TO ILUSTRATE THE SAME BEFORE HE DECLARES HIS JUDGMENT UPON ITFOR HE RELATETH THAT THERE IS BUT ONE WAY AFTER THE DIVISION OF THE WATERS TO PASS TO THE MEDITERRANEAN WHICH IS BY A RIVOLET CAL LED FRESQUEIL THAT IS CONJOYND WITH THE AUDE BUT TO PASS TO THE OCEAN THERE ARE THREE ONE BY RIEGE ENTRING INTO THE GA ROME ABOVE THOLOUSE THE OTHER BY LERS PASSING ON THE SIDE AND BELOW THE SAME TOWN AND THE THIRD BY SOR FALLING IN TOTHE RIVER AGOUST UNDER CASTRES AFTERWARDS INTO THE TARNE AND THENCE TO MONTAUBAN AND LASTLY INTO THE GARONNE AND THAT TO COMPASS THIS DESIGN ALL THESE RIVERS AND RIVOLETS ARE FIRST TO BE MADE NAVIGABLE UNTO THEIR SLUCES THAT OF AUDE AND FRESQUEIL FOR THE MEDITERRANEAN AND ONE OF THE OTHERS SUCH AS SHALL BE CHOSEN FOR THE OCEAN HE ADDETH THATAS TO THE SEVERAL WAYS PASSING TO THE OCEAN ALL OF THEM COMMENDED AS PROPER AND CONVENIENT AND THE THREE COUNTRIES CONCERNED THEREIN SPEAKING EVERY ONE FOR THEIR ADVANTAGE THOSE OF CASTRES AND F MONTAUBAN42 MONTAUBAN ARE FOR THE RIVER AGOUST THOSE OF THOLOUSE FOR RIEGE AND THE REST FOR LERS NOW CONCERNING HIS OPINION UPON THIS PROPOSITION HE THINKS THAT ALL THAT HATH BEEN REPRESENTED TOUCHING THIS MATTER CAN SIGNIFY VERY LITTLESEEINGTHAT THE MAIN THING ISWANTINGWHICH IS THE ASSURANCE AND CERTAIN AND POSITIVE MENSURATION OF THE HEIGHT AND QUANTITY OF THE WATERS NECESSARY TO FALL INTO BOTH THE CHANNELS OF THE AUDE AND GARONNE THAT THERE MUST BE PLEN TY OF THAT TO FURNISH AT ALL TIMES AND ALWAIES THE HIGHEST AND FIRST SLUCES SINCE WHAT ONCE ISSUES THENCE DOTH NEVER ENTER AGAIN INTO THEM AND AFTER SOME BOATS ARE PASSED IF THERE SHOULD NOT BE A SUFFICIENT SUPPLY FOR THOSE THAT COME AFTER EITHER TO GO UP OR TO GO DOWN ALL WOULD STAND DRYAND MERCHANTS AND THEIR COMMODITIES WOULD STAY LONG ENOUGH EXPECTING THE SUPPLY OF RAINS TO THEIR GREAT DETRIMENT HE CONCLUDETH THEREFORE THAT NO KNOWING AND DISCREET PERSON IS ABLE IN MATTERS OF THIS NATURE TO GIVE A POSITIVE ANSWER WITHOUT HAVING BEFORE HIM A LARGE AND EXACT TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP OF THOSE PLACES AND OF THE SOURCES OF ALL THE RIVOLETS THAT ARE TO SUPPLY THE WATER TO THE HEAD OF THE PRETENDED CHANNEL TOGETHER WITH A FULL AC COUNT OF THE SURVEY AND MENSURATION OF ALL THE PLACES THROUGH WHICH IT IS TO PASS OF THE NATURE OF THE GROUND WHETHER IT BE STONY SANDY ROCKY C OF THE EXACT LEVEL OF ALL THE PLACES WHERE IT IS TO BE MADEAND OF THE SEVERAL RISINGS AND DEPRESSIENS THEREOF TO BE ASSURED THAT THE WATER MAY BE CONVEYED TO THE GREATEST RISING AND TO THE HIGHEST SLUCE AND LASTLY OF THE QUAN TITY THAT MAY BE HAD AT HIGH MIDDLE AND LOW WATER TO HAVEE NOUGH FOR ALL TIMES THAT ALL THESE THINGS BEING FIRST MADE OUT TIS THEN TIME ENOUGH TO JUDGE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THE THINGAND TO CALCULATE THE CHARGES NECESSARY FOR EXECUTION THIS ARTIST HAVING THUS PRUDENTLY WAVED THIS PROPOSITION DI VERTS HIMSELF WITH REFLECTING UPON SEVERAL OTHERS OF THE LIKE NA TURE AMONG WHICH HE INSISTS CHIEFLY UPON TWO WHEREOF ONEIS THAT SO MUCH CELEBRATED IN EGYPT THE OTHER OF GERMANY AND HE IS OF OPINION THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL IS THAT OF CON JOYNING THE RED SEA BY THE NILE WITH THE MEDITERRANEAN WHICH HE LOOKS UPON AS THE MOST EXCELLENT CONVENIENCY TO GO INTO THE EASTINDIES WITHOUT DOUBLING THE CAPE OF GOODHOPE AND YET IT COULD43 COULD NOT BE EXECUTED BY THOSE GREAT KINGS OF EGYPT THAT RAI SED SO MANY STUPENDIOUS PYRAMIDS ALTHOUGH IN HIS OPINION THE REASONS ALLEGED BY HISTORIANS TO JUSTIFIE THEM FOR HAVING A BANDONED THAT UNDERTAKING ARE OF NO VALIDITY AND THAT THE RED SEA CANNOT BE AS THEY FEARED HIGHER THAN THE NILE AND THEREFORE NOT INDANGER THE INUNDATION OF EGYPT THE OTHER PROPOSITION WAS MADE TO CHARLES MAGNE ANNO 793 FOR JOYNING THE EUXINE SEA AND THE OCEAN TOGETHER BY A CHAN NEL WHICH WAS BEGUN FOR THAT END AND DESIGNED TO BE 2000 PACES LONG AND 100 PACES BROAD BETWIXT THE RIVER ALTMULL FALLING INTO THE DANUBE ABOVE RATISBONE AND THE RIVER ROTT PAS SING AT NURENBERG AND THENCE RUNNING INTO THE MAIN AND SO INTO THE RHINE BUT YET THIS ALSO PROVED ABORTIVE THOUGH THERE WAS GREAT APPEARANCE OF SUCCESS AT FIRST

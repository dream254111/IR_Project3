of some Particulars iserved during the late Eclzfise of tbe Sun By William Herschel LLD F R S Read January 9 zy94 IT will be proper to remark that my attention in obseraring this eclipse was not directed to the time of the several parti culars which are usually noticed in phnomena of this kirld siuch as the beginning the end and the digits eclipsed I was very well assured that the care of other astronomers would render my endeavours in that respect perfectly unnecessary The only view I had was to avail myself of the power alld distinctness of my telescopes in order to see whether any ap pearances would arise that might deserare tc be recorded and the following particulars will at least serve to point out the way for similar observations to be made irz other eclipses where diffierent circumstatlces may chance to affiord an oppor tunity for gathering some addition to our kllowledge with re gard to the nature alld condition ofthe moon or of thessun and perhaps of both these heaverlly boclies Sept  1y9S 8h 40t g by the clock My attention beiI1g directed to the place where I supposed the first impression would be made I perceived two mountains of the moon enter the disk of the sun as delineated at a b fig 1 Tab VII Tl1e By account my sidereal timepiece was abollt 5 IJ7 too forward butJ as no aransits had been tately takenX there may be an escs of some sesondsD

now acute remain perictly sharp One of theln indeedn was disEgured a little while ago by the erltranceof a mountaul of the moon but is now restored to its sharpness   loh  I delineated the appearance of the limb of the moon upon the sun and found its luountains as in fig 2 At a was a large table mountain as it may be called from its flat appear ance S at b and c were elevated ointed rocks  Their

for on dranwing seve ral of tllem upon the seginent of a large circle so as to look like what they appeared ahthen projected upon the sunf I found them to be from the 1Sbodth to the 2000dth part of the dia meter of that circle ThenS putting the moons liameter7 aS M rE LA LANDE states it aft 782 Frencll leagues or 21Sl English milesn we find the 1 Soodth part of this to be less than one mile and

fig  and suspected sometimes a little lending of the cusps outwards as espressed at b in fig 4 but upon long alad attentive inspectiona I could not satisfy my self of itS Teality If there ras a bending it did probably llOt amount to one secolld of a degree for having formerly been much in the habit of measuring the moons mountains the quantity of one second on its disk was still famxiliar ellough to me to estimate it pretty exactly loh z5t I looked out with the llatural eye for the planet Venus and soon perceived her In the telescope with 28yo she appeared very sharp alzd well defilled and sras a little    gl bbous It suay seem perhaps extraordlnary that in tlze trial above mLentioneda the eye should be able to ascersain the proportion of a quantity so little as the fifteen hundredth or twio thou sandth part of the diameter of the moon but the experiment may be easily repeated in the following nanner Uporz a line six or eight  inches long drawll on a sheet of paper make several small marks representing tnountains on the progected circumference of a large globe The paper beX ing thell placed in a proper light and situation witlldraw the   eye to the distarlce of 7 8 or 9 feet alld take notice which of the marks appear of the sanze size and distinctness with rhe  Irl the years 1779 1780 and 178X I did not measure I suppose less tharl ar hundred 1nountains of the moon in which I used three different methods the projec tion of the tops of these mountains beyond the enlightened part of the disk the length of their shadow on the surface of the moon and their perpendiculalz projection on the full edge of the moons li1nb Some of these observations are contained in a former pwer see Phil Trans Vol EX PartII page 507 but most of them remain uncalculated in my journal till some proper opportunity MDCCIG 15Je GDr HERSCHEL s Account ofn Sc 2 mountains they represent Then from the known angular magnitude of the moon calculate its diameter at the distance of your situation this multiplied by the power of the tele SCOpe7 gives the diameter of a circle to the circumference of which belongs thelineS upon which are placed the marks above descriloed Now tneasure the elevation of these marks above tlaat lin and you will obtain the proportion they kear Xo the diameter of the circle In lny experiment I found that I could plainly see some smclll protuberances at g feet distance which were no higller tharl the oth part of an inch Then putting the diameter of the  moon at gotg we have the sum of the logarithms of the tazgent of 3o X of the povvzer 287 and of the otlls of an inch contained in g feet which taken from the logarithm of theP diameter of the moon in milesg gives the logaritllm of 16 By svhich we findf that so stnall a

J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,106888,ACCOUNT OF SOME PARTICULARS OBSERVED DURING THE LATE ECLIPSE OF THE SUN BY WILLIAM HERSCHEL LL D F R S,I206949, 39 2 VI ACCOUNT OF SOME PARTICULARS ISERVED DURING THE LATE ECLZFISE OF TBE SUN BY WILLIAM HERSCHEL LLD F R S READ JANUARY 9 ZY94 IT WILL BE PROPER TO REMARK THAT MY ATTENTION IN OBSERARING THIS ECLIPSE WAS NOT DIRECTED TO THE TIME OF THE SEVERAL PARTI CULARS WHICH ARE USUALLY NOTICED IN PHNOMENA OF THIS KIRLD SIUCH AS THE BEGINNING THE END AND THE DIGITS ECLIPSED I WAS VERY WELL ASSURED THAT THE CARE OF OTHER ASTRONOMERS WOULD RENDER MY ENDEAVOURS IN THAT RESPECT PERFECTLY UNNECESSARY THE ONLY VIEW I HAD WAS TO AVAIL MYSELF OF THE POWER ALLD DISTINCTNESS OF MY TELESCOPES IN ORDER TO SEE WHETHER ANY AP PEARANCES WOULD ARISE THAT MIGHT DESERARE TC BE RECORDED AND THE FOLLOWING PARTICULARS WILL AT LEAST SERVE TO POINT OUT THE WAY FOR SIMILAR OBSERVATIONS TO BE MADE IRZ OTHER ECLIPSES WHERE DIFFIERENT CIRCUMSTATLCES MAY CHANCE TO AFFIORD AN OPPOR TUNITY FOR GATHERING SOME ADDITION TO OUR KLLOWLEDGE WITH RE GARD TO THE NATURE ALLD CONDITION OFTHE MOON OR OF THESSUN AND PERHAPS OF BOTH THESE HEAVERLLY BOCLIES SEPT  1Y9S 8H 40T G BY THE CLOCK MY ATTENTION BEII1G DIRECTED TO THE PLACE WHERE I SUPPOSED THE FIRST IMPRESSION WOULD BE MADE I PERCEIVED TWO MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON ENTER THE DISK OF THE SUN AS DELINEATED AT A B FIG 1 TAB VII TL1E BY ACCOUNT MY SIDEREAL TIMEPIECE WAS ABOLLT 5 IJ7 TOO FORWARD BUTJ AS NO ARANSITS HAD BEEN TATELY TAKENX THERE MAY BE AN ESCS OF SOME SESONDSD  R HERSCHELVS ACCOUNT OF TH 4O TIME OF THEIR BEGINNING TO APPEAR WHEN I SAW THEM FIRST MIGHT BE ONE OR TWO SECONDS PAST GH 5T 7FEET REFLECTOR POWER 87 THE INTERNAL LUMINOUT ANGLE MADE ON THE SUN BY THE INTERSECTION OF THE LIMB OF THE MOON NVHLCH IS NOW BUT LITTLE MORE THAN A RECTANGLEY IS PER FECTLY SHARP UP TO THE VERY POINT IT TIS NOT IN THE LEAST DISS GURED HY THE REFRACTION OF THE LUNAR ATMOSPHERE THE PRESENT SHAPE OF THE ANGLE HOWEVER IS NOT FAVOURABIE FOR SHEWING THE ESECTS OF THAT ATMOSPHERE W    9X 17TH7 THE LUMI NCUS ANGLES OF THE SUNVS PRECEDING AND FOL 10WING LIMBSN WHICH ARE NOW ACUTE REMAIN PERICTLY SHARP ONE OF THELN INDEEDN WAS DISEGURED A LITTLE WHILE AGO BY THE ERLTRANCEOF A MOUNTAUL OF THE MOON BUT IS NOW RESTORED TO ITS SHARPNESS   LOH  I DELINEATED THE APPEARANCE OF THE LIMB OF THE MOON UPON THE SUN AND FOUND ITS LUOUNTAINS AS IN FIG 2 AT A WAS A LARGE TABLE MOUNTAIN AS IT MAY BE CALLED FROM ITS FLAT APPEAR ANCE S AT B AND C WERE ELEVATED OINTED ROCKS  THEIR AP PEARANCE CHANGING PRETTY FASTN NOPGREAT ACCURACY CAN BE EX PECTEDIN THEIR EXPRESSD RELATIVE SIDTUATION I SUPPOSE THE HEIGHT OF THE MOST ELEVATED OF THESE MOUN TAINS NOT TO EXCEED A MILE AND AN HALF FOR ON DRANWING SEVE RAL OF TLLEM UPON THE SEGINENT OF A LARGE CIRCLE SO AS TO LOOK LIKE WHAT THEY APPEARED AHTHEN PROJECTED UPON THE SUNF I FOUND THEM TO BE FROM THE 1SBODTH TO THE 2000DTH PART OF THE DIA METER OF THAT CIRCLE THENS PUTTING THE MOONS LIAMETER7 AS M RE LA LANDE STATES IT AFT 782 FRENCLL LEAGUES OR 21SL ENGLISH MILESN WE FIND THE 1 SOODTH PART OF THIS TO BE LESS THAN ONE MILE AND AN HALF FOR TLLE HIGHEST AND THE 2CROODTH PARTN NOT QUITE ONE MILE AND A TENTLL FOR THE LOWESTLATE ECLIPSE OF TBE X TT I ATTENDED ALL THIS TIME TO THE APPFEARALLEE OF THE SLEARP LIMB A B C OF THE SUN  FIG  AND SUSPECTED SOMETIMES A LITTLE LENDING OF THE CUSPS OUTWARDS AS ESPRESSED AT B IN FIG 4 BUT UPON LONG ALAD ATTENTIVE INSPECTIONA I COULD NOT SATISFY MY SELF OF ITS TEALITY IF THERE RAS A BENDING IT DID PROBABLY LLOT AMOUNT TO ONE SECOLLD OF A DEGREE FOR HAVING FORMERLY BEEN MUCH IN THE HABIT OF MEASURING THE MOONS MOUNTAINS THE QUANTITY OF ONE SECOND ON ITS DISK WAS STILL FAMXILIAR ELLOUGH TO ME TO ESTIMATE IT PRETTY EXACTLY LOH Z5T I LOOKED OUT WITH THE LLATURAL EYE FOR THE PLANET VENUS AND SOON PERCEIVED HER IN THE TELESCOPE WITH 28YO SHE APPEARED VERY SHARP ALZD WELL DEFILLED AND SRAS A LITTLE    GL BBOUS IT SUAY SEEM PERHAPS EXTRAORDLNARY THAT IN TLZE TRIAL ABOVE MLENTIONEDA THE EYE SHOULD BE ABLE TO ASCERSAIN THE PROPORTION OF A QUANTITY SO LITTLE AS THE FIFTEEN HUNDREDTH OR TWIO THOU SANDTH PART OF THE DIAMETER OF THE MOON BUT THE EXPERIMENT MAY BE EASILY REPEATED IN THE FOLLOWING NANNER UPORZ A LINE SIX OR EIGHT  INCHES LONG DRAWLL ON A SHEET OF PAPER MAKE SEVERAL SMALL MARKS REPRESENTING TNOUNTAINS ON THE PROGECTED CIRCUMFERENCE OF A LARGE GLOBE THE PAPER BEX ING THELL PLACED IN A PROPER LIGHT AND SITUATION WITLLDRAW THE   EYE TO THE DISTARLCE OF 7 8 OR 9 FEET ALLD TAKE NOTICE WHICH OF THE MARKS APPEAR OF THE SANZE SIZE AND DISTINCTNESS WITH RHE  IRL THE YEARS 1779 1780 AND 178X I DID NOT MEASURE I SUPPOSE LESS THARL AR HUNDRED 1NOUNTAINS OF THE MOON IN WHICH I USED THREE DIFFERENT METHODS THE PROJEC TION OF THE TOPS OF THESE MOUNTAINS BEYOND THE ENLIGHTENED PART OF THE DISK THE LENGTH OF THEIR SHADOW ON THE SURFACE OF THE MOON AND THEIR PERPENDICULALZ PROJECTION ON THE FULL EDGE OF THE MOONS LI1NB SOME OF THESE OBSERVATIONS ARE CONTAINED IN A FORMER PWER SEE PHIL TRANS VOL EX PARTII PAGE 507 BUT MOST OF THEM REMAIN UNCALCULATED IN MY

YOUR SITUATION THIS MULTIPLIED BY THE POWER OF THE TELE SCOPE7 GIVES THE DIAMETER OF A CIRCLE TO THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF WHICH BELONGS THELINES UPON WHICH ARE PLACED THE MARKS ABOVE DESCRILOED NOW TNEASURE THE ELEVATION OF THESE MARKS ABOVE TLAAT LIN AND YOU WILL OBTAIN THE PROPORTION THEY KEAR XO THE DIAMETER OF THE CIRCLE IN LNY EXPERIMENT I FOUND THAT I COULD PLAINLY SEE SOME SMCLLL

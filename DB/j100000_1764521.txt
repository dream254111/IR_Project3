used the methods of sensitizing and the trays and dishes used for the purpose and describes various forms of printingframes He then proceeds to describe the numerous processes that have been suggested and states their advantages and disadvantages Formulae which were found not practical but which are recom mended by reliable authorities have also been given The patented processes are included although they cannot be used generally in order to give a complete review of the subject treated The first thousand copies of the book are accompanied by ten specimens of heliographic prints among which the uranium and carbon prints deserve special mention The first chapters in which the methods of sensitizing and printing are described are accompanied by nu merous figures illustrating the instruments and processes When Age Grows Young By HYLAND C KIRK New York Dillingham I6 50 cents THE author of this work published a few years ago a speculation on the possibility of not dying in which he undertook to maintain that it was possible to prolong human physical life indefinitely and now in accordance with the fashion of the time he comes before us with a romance in which he maintains the same view The story has no very consistent plot but contains a considerable variety of incident of a more or less interesting character The principal personage in the story however who is known as Daniel Ritter and who is the advocate of the theory of physical immor tality is by no means an agreeable character He has some pleas ing traits and is gifted with the power of telepathy on which some of the main incidents of the story are made to turn But he wishes to obtain twenty thousand dollars in order to marry the girl he loves and gets it by defrauding an insurance company As for the possibility of not dying which  Ritter  maintains it depends we are told on certain conditions The first is  to believe it pos sible  the second  to be in accord with the Will of the Universe the third to make the cause of humanity your own  and  the final step is the triumph of love in life whatever that may mean Now without entering into the biological objections to such a theory we would remark that the first of these conditions seems to be the most difficult of attainment We are told by the prophet of an older gospel that if we have sufficient faith we can remove mountains but the difficulty with most people is to get the faith and we apprehend that Mr Kirks doctrine will encounter the same obstacle However if any one wishes to learn about the theory he will take an interest in reading this book for it has at least the literary merit of being written in a good style The Battle of the Swash and the Cafpture of Canada By SAMUEL BARTON New York C T Dillingham I6 50 cents THIS little book is of the Battle of Dorking class It pur ports to be an account of an attack upon New York by a British fleet in the year 1890 together with other exciting events including the capture of Canada which occurred in the same year The reason for the books existence and the keynote of the authors rather lively tune may be found in the dedication of the volume which runs as follows   To the senators and exsenators members and exmembers of past andpresent Congresses of the United States of America who by their stupid and criminal neglect to adopt ordinary defensive precautions or to encourage the reconstruction of the American merchant marine have rendered all American seaport towns liable to such an attack as is herein but faintly and imperfectly described this historical forecast is dedicated with much indignation and contempt and little or no respect The author  makes his title clear  by explaining to those of his readers not familiar with New York waters that the Swash is a straight channel forming a sort of hypothenuse to the two sides of the main shipchannel which bends almost at right angles at the southwest spit in the outer bay The admiral of the British fleet selected this channel as his base of operations against New York  Blinding buoys torpedoes and torpedoboats dynamite guns and gunboats submarine boats and various other devices played a I3 more or less important part in defending the city against the enemy But the most effective work was done by two insignificantlooking boats  evidently invented by the author  which involved a new principle of marine warfare as applicable to harbor defence These boats carried no arms or ammunition excepting a hollow steel ram containing two tons of dynamite Almost completely submerged and travelling at a speed of thirty miles an hour they made for two of the most formidable of the British ironclads When so close to their victims that there was no risk of mi3sing the mark the pilots of the boats the only men remaining aboard quietly dropped overboard to be afterward picked up The rams penetrate the sides of the ironclads two explosions follow and there is nothing left of either but fragments Notwithstanding all this the British fleet enters the upper bay and at the end of two days bom bardment the Brooklyn navyyard the East River bridge and the lower part of New York City are utterly destroyed But the book must be read to be appreciated It is well written and interesting and puts into striking form the essence of the many arguments advanced from time to time for restoring our merchant marine strengthening our coast defences and the navy and supplementing the latter by a naval reserve More about the Black Bass By JAMES A HENSHALL MD Cincinnati Robert Clarke  Co I2 150 THIS volume is a supplement to the  Book of the Black Bass by the same author who is an expert angler and an eminently practical writer on black bass and bassfishing He has thought it best to issue this supplement in a separate volume letting the origi nal edition remain intact the chapters in both volumes being so arranged as to agree in number and caption The plan pursued in the original book of illustrating the tools and tackle by engravings especially prepared for manufacturers to illustrate their different lines of specialties has been adhered to in the supplement The book is divided into three parts The first part treats of the scientific history nomenclature and morphology general and spe cial features coloration geographical distribution habits and intel ligence and special senses of the black bass and on stocking inland waters with them Fishing rods reels lines hooks artificial flies artificial and natural baits and miscellaneous implements receive attention in the second part The third part is devoted to the philosophy of angling conditions governing the biting of fish the black bass as a gamefish flyfishing casting the minnow still fishing trolling and skittering and bobbing The volume will be welcomed by every genuine angler who  loves angling for its own sake while even the potfisher who  likes fishing for the spoils it brings may find in it valuable hints that will increase his income AMONG THE PUBLISHERS AT last we are treated to a novelty in the way of almanac making Dr J C Ayer  Co the wellknown manufacturers of Ayers sarsaparilla Lowell Mass send us their  Almanac for I889 in the shape of a goodsized book embracing editions in English calculated for the various sections of the United States the Dominion of Canada India South Africa and Australia also editions in nine other languages The volume contains also specimen pages of pamphlets issued by the company in eleven languages not represented by the almanacs including Greek Tur kish Armenian Chinese Burmese and Hawaiian twentyone languages in all From the preface we learn that no fewer than fourteen millions of these almanacs are printed yearly A copy of this favorite almanac may be had at your druggists It is a species of yellow covered literature of value Never without some papers which are sterling contributions to political and social science The Atlantic for January has in this

Characteristics and by John Fiske on  Washingtons Great Campaign of 1776 JANUARY 4 I88914 SCIENCE The most important article in the  Political Science Quar terly for December is by Professor Theodore W Dwight on The Legality of Trusts  The writer considers the common law doctrine respecting restraint of trade and other principles bearing on the question and reaches the conclusion that trusts are partnerships like any others and that unless they can be shown to have been formed wilh the intent of raising prices unduly or for some other distinctly unlawful purpose they are lawful under the law as it now stands He then goes on to maintain that the con stitutional provision that no man shall be deprived of liberty with out due process of law forbids the State to interfere with them  or in his own words if the trust  is now lawful as a reasonable and proper element in production it cannot properly be made un lawful by legislative acts of a stigmatizing character which seems rather singular doctrine The sale of intoxicating liquors is now lawful in the State of New York but is the Legislature for bidden by the Constitution to prohibit it  Besides this paper of Professor Dwights there is an article by Professor Hadley on  Public Business Management that is worthy of attention The writer considers the question in various aspects and with reference to recent examples and reaches the conclusion that the manage ment ot business enterprises by the State or the city has not thus far proved very successful On the other hand Mr William Clarke in discussing Socialism in English Politics maintains the opposite view and predicts the rapid growth of State socialism in England Professor Burgess treats of the law recently passed regulating the electoral count by the Houses of Congress and pronounces it nothing but a makeshift The concluding essay in the review is by two English writers on  The Ballot in England and gives both a history of the subject and an account of the kind of ballot now in use there At the present time when the ques tion of ballot reform has become important in America this article will be found useful  The Worthington Co have ready  Our Presidents by Vir ginia F Townsend giving the lives of the twentytwo Presidents of the United States enlivened by anecdotes and romantic incidents in the lives of the men who received the highest honor in the gift of their countrymen The fine steel portraits of these men are the work of H B Hall  Sons and are executed with great care In these days of all sorts and conditions of reproduction processes it is a rest to the eyes to see the solid steel engravings of former days once more The publishers get out this timely work in an diztion de luxe limited to five hundred copies with portraits printed on In dia

was fifty thousand copies of which forty thousand went to the United States Ameri cans that is have bought four times as many copies of the best English encyclopaedia as the English themselves have America has in fact absorbed a million quarto volumes of this great work These figures we presume refer only to the editions handled in this country by Little Brown  Co and Charles Scribners Sons and

Kennan in an article entitled  The Life of Administrative Exiles presents some of the most astounding facts gathered by him in Siberia The article is without illustrations The writer says in introducing it that to present a large number of closely related facts concerning this branch of the subject in the chronological order in which they were obtained would be to scatter them through half a dozen arti cles and thus deprive them of much of their cumulative force and significance He therefore groups these facts in a single paper which necessitates a brief interruption of the

just been issued by the United States Geological Survey It covers the calendar year 1887 The statis tical tables contained in the former volumes have been brought for ward but repetition of descriptive matter has been avoided wher ever possible The result of Professor Days careful investigations shows an aggregate value of 538o56345 for the mineral indus tries of the United States This is nearly 73000000 more than the product in I886 and considerably more than Ioooooooo in I5 excess of the year I885 Of many items which have contributed to this result all the metals increased in quantity except gold and the minor metal nickel and nearly all increased in price The signifi cance of this is seen in the increased production of the fuels neces sary for reducing these metals and preparing them for use All of these fuels including natural gas show a marked increase The value of buildingstone increased considerably but this appar ent advance is principally due to a more careful canvass of this in dustry than has been possible in previous years Professor Day does not consider it probable that the great total recorded for I887 will be equalled in the present year  A Course of

pp 267 268 for Mr Gilberts ingenious hypothesis that birds in soaring utilize the varying velocities and directions of the horizontal aircurrents at different levels one might perhaps add this that the inclined planes of the circles described should be observably related to the direc tion etc of the wind at the earths surface and of the clouddrift above For instance if the upper current relatively to the lower was from the north we might expect the higher side of the circle to be the north side or else to be that side along which the bird was flying southward JANUARY 4 I889

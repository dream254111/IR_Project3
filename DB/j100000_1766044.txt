concluded to find out if I could the character of the termination of the column of the crinoid Heterocrinus suberassus Having a lower silurian slab with about one hundred specimens of the calyx with a great profusion of the columns diverging in every direction I selected a culumn attached to its calyx and followed it by uncovering until I was rewarded by discovering the column diverging into welldefined roots length of column from calyx 12 inches about 1 inches under the sur face At that time I believed that the genus Glyptocrinus were float ers and devoid of bases or roots About eighteen months ago something caused me to doubt that idea and I commenced the investigation of the terminations of their columns and now after a great deal of work and after many discouragements I have been able to so far develop roots on the terminations of the columns of Glyptocrinus neali Glypt dyeri and Glypt baeri that I have a specimen of each species show ing the calyx column and roots intact on the slab one slab of Glypt baeri having on its surface several specimens of that character One character of the specimens surprised me the diversity of the length of the columns between calyx and roots in the speci mens just mentioned the column of Glypt neali from two to four or five inches Glypt baeri from onehalf an inch to six or eight Glypt dyeri from one to four or five inches between calyx and roots I have also found a specimen of Heterocrinus simplex showing calyx column and inverted saucerlike base attached to another column DR D T D DYCHE Lebanon 0 Professor Parkers Further Studies on the Apteryx IN No 435 of Science the writer invited attention to the very valuable contributions to our knowledge of the morphology of Apteryx that had been made by Professor T J Parker FRS of the Otago Museum New Zealand Those investigations have been continued on more extensive material and the London Royal Society have just published in their Transactions 1892 the results in a paper entitled Additional Observation on the Development of Apteryx  11 pages two col lith plates of 19 figs Professor Parker has kindly sent me a copy of this work and I desire to say in the present connection in continuation of what already has been noted by me in my former review that more advanced em bryos of the bird under investigation stage F1 show  the pollex is unusually large and the forelimb has the characters of the wing of a typical bird Better figures are given than in the first paper showing structures of the brain and skull and also that one specimen exhibits an unusual mode of termination of the noto chord In other figures stage G the final form of the chondro cranium before the appearance of cartilage bones is shown and what is a very interesting fact  that in A oweni there is always a solid coracoid region to the shouldergirdle while in A australis as far back as stage F there is a coracoid fenestra and a liga mentous procoracoid Finally it is worthy of note that in addition to the elements described in the corpus an intermedium may be present  As I have already said the working out of these anatomical characters in such an important form as Apteryx will most certainly prove to be of the highest importance and use to the general comparative anatomist the world over There could be no safer hand to accomplish it for us than that of the distin guished biologist of the Otago Museum R W SHUFELDT Takoma DC July 24 VOL XX No 495 A Satellite of the Moon I HAVE seen accounts of an attempt to discover whether the moon has a satellite and the accounts that have reached me seem to show one serious fault in the procedure While I am not thor oughly conversant with all the points involved it does seem to me that in taking a photograph of the region in which such a satellite would be found if it exists the apparatus should be arranged with reference to stellar motion and leave the moon out of ques tion Of course the moon would be blurred but we are not con cerned about that The fixed stars would appear plainly on the plate while any one that had a motion different from theirs es pecially a rapid motion such as a satellite of the moon must have would appear blurred on the plate in which case only the blurred stars if such occurred need be examined with any hope of finding a satellite of the moon C P MAXWELL Dublin Tex July 20 Auroral Display ON Saturday night July 16 1892 I was returning to my home in Rockville Indiana from Clinton Indiana sixteen miles south west Mr Harry McIntosh a young man of this place who had been helping me make a survey near Clinton was riding with me in my buggy We amused ourselves looking at a most beautiful sunset as we rode over the Lafayette and Terre Haute road along the foot of the high hills east of the Wabash River When we turned eastward over the hills toward Rockville it began to grow dark and most of the clouds that showed up so beautiful at sunset began to vanish till only a few streaks of stratus clouds remained As we were descending the west hill at Iron Creek five miles southwest of Rockville we saw in front of us what we supposed was the new electric light at Rockville thrown upward and reflected from a cloud or mist As we were ascending the hill on the east side of the creek and near its sum mit we saw in our front the reflection of a great light from behind us It was so noticeable as to cause us both to turn about on our buggy seat and look backward There at a bearing S 60 W that is the bearing of the road with which the light was in alinement we saw a great white light radiating from a point at the horizon where it was brightest right left and upward to a height of 10 to 15Q weakening in brilliancy as it radiated and terminated in a dark band or segment of rainbow shape some 10 wide The light seemed to radiate from a point a halfradius above the centre of the circle which the black segment would indicate Above the dark segment another segment or band of light not so bright as the one at the horizon formed a rainbow or arch some 10 to 150 wide Above that second band of light was a light haze or mist through which the stars could be easily distinguished Some 10 up in that mist and directly over the centre of the light at the horizon was a light about as large as a man would appear to be if suspended from a balloon a thousand feet distant It was about four times as long vertically as wide horizontally Young Mcintosh saw it first and called my atten tion to it as I was watching the bright light at the horizon When I first caught sight of it it had the appearance of the head of a comet only it was long vertically When young Mcintosh first saw it it seemed to be a blaze such as a large meteor appears to carry at its front We halted and watched it about ten min utes during which time it the small light slowly faded till only its locality could barely be noticed then suddenly loomed bright almost to a white blaze then slowly faded as before It would loom up in five seconds and consume five minutes in fading away It kept the same position all the time for we watched its position with relation to the stars to see if it moved At this second appearance I decided to commit the general appearance to memory so I could sketch it afterward This little light loomed up and faded four times when the big light under it faded also and made it dark there I am not sure we saw this light the first time it appeared but think we did The small light above looked as the moon does when shining through a thin cloud except as to the oblong shape vertically When the fir4s or southwestern light faded nearly out a light

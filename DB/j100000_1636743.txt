ago prompted its adop tion as will be evident from the following quotations from various textbooks and geo logical papers selected somewhat at random  Manual of Geology Dana 4th ed p 366 The ridges of the Great Basin    have been assumed to be each limited by faults    and to have become in effect monoclinal orographic blocks1 Elements of Geology LeConte 5th ed p 239 The strata are broken into prismatic blocks The slipping of these blocks has given rise to cliffs An Introduction to Geology Scott 2d ed p 5 Rocks are divided into still larger masses or blocks by    fissures and planes of dislocation or faults Pp 464 and 465 The plateau of basalt has been fractured into a series of blocks which are tilted    Exploration of the Colorado River of the West and Its Tributaries Powell p 184 The faults    divide the district under con sideration into long belts or blocks  In ex amining the downthrow of these blocks it is observed     Geology of the Henry Mountains G K Gilbert p 23 The strata of the upper part of the arch of Mt Ellsworth are divided by faults into a number of prismoid blocks The Geology of the Eastern Portion of the Uinta Mountains by J W Powell pp 16 17 When the blocks into which a district of country has been broken by faults are greatly tilted    the uplifted edges of such blocks often form long mountain ridges  In this region many zones are found to be divided into small blocks by faults Fig 4 is a birdseye view of the blocks mentioned Fig 5 is a diagram of the same region showing the blocks into which it is severed 1Italics here and below by the writer of this note   Many other areas far more complex than these have been discovered where a zone has been broken into blocks and these blocks tipped and con torted    The Ore Deposits of New Mexico Lind gren Graton and Gordon Professional Paper 68 U S Geological Survey p 25 The principal disturbances    are marked by a series of    ranges of apparently tilted blocks Bulletin of the University of Texas No 93 A Sketch of the Geology of the Chisos Country p 80 It the Chisos country covers a part of a sunken block which measures about 39 miles from east to west and which has settled from four to six thousand feet below the level of the terranes on either side SCIENCE N S Vol XXXVII No 945 p 226 Keyes speaks of the socalled faultblock mountains and refers to a statement by Spur that no one has ever seen the faultlines blocking out the desert ranges It will be seen from these quotations that block is a term which has long been in use and which is being used at the present time with a definite meaning similar to that pro posed It seems to be needed If retained and used in the same sense as heretofore it will aid in giving greater precision to the geological nomenclature We need the term segment for a slightly different use as already stated J A UDDEN UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS CRITICAL CRITERIA ON BASIN RANGE STRUCTURE CHARLES R KEYES in a recent number of SCIENCEt presents a note entitled as above in which he expresses in general terms his lack of belief in Basin Range Structure so called and suggests deflative agencies rather than local tectonic displacement as the im portant factor in the formation of such ranges The writer has no desire at this time to de fend the hypothesis of basin range structure though he is thoroughly convinced of the 1N S Vol 37 No 945 p 226 710 SCIENCEMAY 9 1913 SCIENCE soundness of this tenet but only to right any misconception which may arise from the slightly ambiguous statement made by Mr Keyes in which the writers name is men tioned To be explicit Mr Keyes says  The present sharp meeting of mountain and plain is now explained by causes other than dislocation through ordinary stream corro sion according to Paige The writer wishes to say that in the paper from which the idea above is drawn2 the proc ess under discussion was the formation of cer tain sloping planated rock surfaces which though likely to originate on the borders of enclosed desert basins do not in the process of their formation vitiate in any way the hypoth esis of basin range structure In fact such surfaces may be used to prove by their ele vated positions the very existence of such faults as are needed to establish the basin range structure They are but an incident in a long series of changes of which basin range structure itself is but a minor part After all there is nothing inherently antagonistic in processes of deflation stream erosion or block faulting All have operated and are operating today and any explanation of physiographic forms or account of physiographic history which would ignore any one of them is open to obvious criticism SIDNEY PAIGE AN INVESTIGATION OF A  HAUNTED HOUSE CALLED by telephone a few days ago to examine a large and handsome house in the Back Bay district of Boston for the reason that it was acquiring an unfortunate and annoying reputation as being haunted the writer found a really serious state of affairs The trouble centered in the third and fourth stories which were occupied by the children and servantsthe slumbers of whom were disturbed by strange sensations It was said to be a common occurrence for servants to awake in the night with a sensation of oppres sion  as if some one were tapping upon me or with a  creeping feeling going all over me with a feeling of being paralyzed  Sounds 2Rockcut Surfaces in the Desert Ranges Journal of Geology Vol 20 No 5 1912 were also said to be heard as if some one were walking about the house or overhead These sensations often continued after the sleeper was thoroughly awake and even after the lights had been turned on The children of the family who also slept on the upper floors were similarly affected A little boy for ex ample awoke one night and inquired of his nurse why she had been lying on him and persisted for some time in his delusion An other child rushed screaming into the nurses room crying that a man was waking him up and asking why she let the man frighten him so The children appeared sluggish in the morning and pale even cold water losing its power to enliven them These and other symptoms were well defined and often repeated and had extended over the period of about two months during which the family had occupied the house as tenants Upon inquiry it appeared that previous ten ants had been troubled in the same way mat ters having reached the point where the servants actually talked of seeing walking apparitions The present occupant although not entertaining any vitalistic theory of the phenomena was fully alive to the reality and gravity of the situation and anxious to find the underlying cause A comparatively simple and mechanistic solution of the problem soon appeared It had been suspected that the trouble might have its origin in undetected leaks of illuminating gas and the writer was called in to verify this theory It developed however that the large amount of  furnace  gas escaping from a viciously defective hotair furnace was quite sufficient to cause the trouble In this fur nace the separation between the fire box and the hot air ducts upon which the hygienic integrity of the apparatus depends was badly broken and as a result the inhabitants of the house were bathed in an atmosphere of diluted flue gases To make matters worse a small boiler for a steamheating system had been placed within the fire box directly over the fire the effect being to cool the top of the fire and so promote incomplete combustion 711

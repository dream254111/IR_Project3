against the defendant trust com pany to recover a deposit made by it therein The defendant moved to interplead a third party who sued it for the same deposit Held that the Kingdom of Roumania having voluntarily brought suit waived its immunity as a sovereign power and was subject to an interpleader Kingdom of Roumania v Guaranty Trust Co of N Y D C S D N Y 1917 244 Fed 195 Reversed but not yet reported C C A See 58 N Y L J 1187 It is well established that an independent state may neither be sued in the courts of another state DeHaber v Queen of Portugal 1851 17 Q B 196 nor its property seized or made the subject of judicial process Vavasseur v Krupp 1878 9 Ch D 351 Schooner Exchange v MFaddon 1812 11 U S 116 Parlement Beige 1880 42 L T R N s 273 Nor may a sovereign be sued in another state though a citizen of that state for acts done in his sovereign capacity in his own country Duke of Brunswick v King of Hanover 1848 2 H L C 1 And even where a sovereign residing in another state has entered into a contract under an assumed name as a private indi vidual he will nevertheless be allowed to set up his sovereignty as a defense to a suit brought against him on that contract Mighell v Sultan of Johore 1894 1 Q B D 149 However a sovereign state may avail itself of the courts of a foreign jurisdiction to redress a wrong done it in respect to its property Emperor of Austria v Day  Kossuth 1861 3 DeG F  J 217 238 But where a state has submitted to jthe courts jurisdiction it may not subsequently raise an objection to the jurisdiction Richardson v Fajardo Sugar Co 1916 241 U S 44 36 Sup Ct 476 and it must conform to the rules of practice of the court King of Spain v Hullet  Widder 1833 1 Cl  F 333 So a sovereign is subject to a cross bill Rothschild v Queen of Portugal 1839 3 Y  C 94 and must if required give security for costs Moreover the defendant in an action begun by a sovereign may assert a lien United States v Wilder 1838 28 Fed Cas No 16694 or contract rights United States of America v Prioleau 1865 2 Hem  M 559 which he has acquired with regard to the property claimed While it is suggested that a counterclaim might be allowed see Strousberg v Republic of Costa Rica 1880 44 L T R N s 199 it is settled that no affirmative judgment may be rendered against the sovereign United States v Eckford 1867 173 U S 484 South African Republic v Compagnie FrancoBeige etc 1898 1 Ch 190 In all the cases where the defendant has been allowed to assert Fights there would seem to have been a waiver by the sovereignty of its im munity from suit And as illustrated by the cases involving counter claims the courts will protect rights which have not been waived In the principal case it seems clear that in bringing its action the Kingdom of Roumania did not in any way waive its immunity from suit by the party sought to be impleaded and the interpleader should not be allowed LARCENYEVIDENCE OF POSSESSIONUNIDENTIFIED GOODSIn a prose cution for larceny evidence that the defendants when arrested had in their possession various articles of jewelry not identified as the prop erty of the prosecuting witness was held admissible as tending to show property in the hands of the accused subsequent to the alleged larceny Commonwealth v Coyne et al Mass 1917 117 N E 337 175COLUMBIA LAW REVIE W As a general rule evidence of other crimes committed by the defend ant to prove the particular offense for which he is being tried is inadmissible on the ground that the admission of such evidence would unduly influence the jury against him People v Molineux 1901 168 N Y 264 61 N E 286 2 Columbia Law Rev 39 However evidence of a former offense is admissible to prove the specific crime when it tends to show motive Thompson v United States C C A 1906 144 Fed 14 or intent Mitchell v State 1904 140 Ala 118 37 So 76 or the identity of the accused People v Jennings 1911 252 Ill 534 96 N E 1077 or a common scheme embracing the

defendant had recent possession of the property for the larceny of which he is being tried is always admissible 1 Wigmore Evidence  152 Moreover there is a division of authority as to the effect of such evidence Wigmore op cit  2513 some jurisdictions holding that it raises a presumption in law of the guilt of the defendant State v Court 1910 225 Mo 609 125 S W 451 and others holding that it is such evidence from which the jury might infer the guilt of the accused if he cannot explain possession Thompson v State 1909 58 Fla 106 50 So 507 Moreover evidence is admitted to show that the defendant had no money before the alleged larceny and an unexplained sum of money after the specific offense in question State v Bruce 1890 106 N C 793 11 S E 475 State v Thompson 1893 87 Iowa 670 54 N W 1077 People v Kelly 1901 132 Cal 430 64 Pac 563 contra Williams v United States 1897 168 U S 382 18 Sup Ct 92 on the ground that such a sudden change of circumstances is a sus picious fact which the jury has a right to consider in connection with other evidence which points strongly to the defendants guilt See Commonwealth v Montgomery 1846 52 Mass 534 The court in the principal case apparently admitted the evidence in question on this ground But it would seem that the decision is a further encroachment on the general rule that evidence of other crimes is inadmissible For if any inference of guilt can be drawn from the testimony admitted it would seem to be that the defendant had gained possession of the unidentified collection of jewelry in the commission of other larcenies than the one charged There would seem to be no such inference as is drawn from the sudden possession of money since money might well be the proceeds of a recent larceny It is submitted that the evidence in the principal case should have been excluded NEGLIGENCERECOVERY BY INVITED GUEST IN AUTOMOBILE FOR PERSONAL INJURYThe plaintiff having been invited by the defendant to ride in her automobile while a guest in the latters home was injured in an accident due to the negligence of the chauffeur In a tort action for damages held in the absence of evidence of gross negligence on the part of the defendant the plaintiff could not recover Massaletti v Fitzroy Mass 1917 56 Banker  Tradesman 875 The courts have by a number of decisions stated that the status of one invited to take an

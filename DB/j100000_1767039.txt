j100000,Science,1767039,The Neanderthal Skull,i300671,SCIENCE In every aspect of the matter the senseorgan must be present before its nerve can have a separate existence The terms utricularis and  saccularis are in all respects suitable and descriptive of the things to be named Both of the nerves to which they are applied supply parts of the same organ complex which forms a well differentiated structure and since both parts must have very similar functions it is certainly unadvisable to leave out of the designation all reference to the accepted idea as to the f unction which they subserve Consequently I hold that the names which I used in my memoir on the ear are the most suitable and the best grounded terms yet proposed for a revised nomenclature The names may be used in full as Nervus acusti cus utricularis and Nervus acusticus saccularis or abbreviated to N ac utric and N ac sac or since they are not liable to be come confused with other nerve names we may write simply N utric and N sac For the branches of each of these nerves we may write respectively ramus cristee anterioris N utric   externee   maculae utriculi ramus cristre posterioris N sac   cochlearis  maculie sacculi HOWARD AYERS The Lake Laboratory Milwaukee Wis Mar 20 1893 The Neanderthal Skull I HAVE waited in the hope that some one more competent than myself would take up this matter but this failing I am induced to send a short note on the enquiry into the reality of our ven erable troglodyte Dr Brinton quotes very high authority in his letter few higher than Virchow could be found But it appears to me that the whole story was not given We are all concerned to know the exact truth and value of these old relics of prehistoric man But just now the iconoclasts are abroad in the land and they may as they have done in days past go too far on that side The Neanderthal skull has never been unequivocally accepted as a type chiefly because it stood so long alone But a race has been namned after it by some anthropologists provisionally at leastthe Canstadt etc The evidence in favor of its authenticity has been before the world for many years almost unchallenged and with all respect to the eminent men engaged in the controversy I submit that it is not quite in accord with logic or with scientific method to base an objection against the positive testimony of the discoverer on the mere recollection of his surviving widow nearly forty years after the discovery was made Waiving all other considerations we know how treacherous is the memory of an event in which we were not deeply interested and which we only in part comprehended after half a lifetime has passed since it occurred And that Frau Fuhlrott was in this mental condition is obvious from Professor Virchows own ad mission that she made this statement to him in entire uncon sciousness of the weighty results involved This of itself is suffi cient to greatly reduce its value But there is yet another important element in the problem to be considered In Sir C Lyells  Antiquity of Man he thus describes the place I I visited the spot in 1860 in company with Dr Fuhlrott sic who had the kindness to come from Elberfeld expressly to be my guide and who brought with him the original fossil skull The spot is a deep and narrow ravine The cave occurs on the precipitous southern or left side of the winding ravine about sixty feet above the stream and a hundred feet be low the top of the cliff He then gives a sectional view show ing an opening to the surface and adds  Through this passage the loam which covered the floor and possibly the human body to which the bones belonged may have been washed into the cave below  There was no stalagmite overlying the mud in which the human skeleton was found The loam which was five feet thick was removed and the human skull was noticed near the entrance the other bones lying farther in on the same IgI horizon The skull and bones had lost so much of their animal matter as to adhere strongly to the tongue agreeing in this re spect with the ordinary condition of fossil bones of the postplio cene period The loneliness of the Neanderthal skull has been much relieved by later discoveries especially by that of Professors Lohest and Fraipont at Liege but waiving this and keeping to the main point it is not easy to understand how testimony so direct and explicit can be at once overthrown by a recollection of an unin terested party after 35 years interval It will be at once seen how widely Sir C Lyells description of the ground written by an eyewitness differs from that given in the first letter on the subject in Science Moreover Lyells description shows that not the skull alone but other bones and probably the whole skeleton were present Our lowbrowed palaeolithic  ancestor has still enough material left to make out a good case E W CLAYPOLE Akron O March 29 Prehistoric Coil Pottery IN the dim past when primeval men occupied this continent no one knows for how long a period they raised mounds dwelt in caves or built towns that are now below the surface of the earth In all this longera they used flint or stone implements for all edged tools hammers axes spears etc At the same time having no COIL POTTERY metal pots or kettles a rough earthen ware was used for cook ing and for all other uses for which we now use iron tin and wooden vessels There is somewhat of a resemblance in many of the stone implements all over the world It is only recently that it has been discovered that there is a similar resemblance in much of the pottery of this early age especially in the coil pottery This pottery was made by rolling clay into long strings like cord and while soft beginning with one end to coil it round and round increasing the size of the bottom till it assumed the desired dimensions then shaping it up the sides just as straw hats are made till the required form and size was attained see illustration The most extraordinary part of the investigation is that this ware made in the same manner is found in the mounds of Florida and Ohio in the cliffdwellings of New Mexico and Arizona in the buried cities of the cafnons of these terri tories also in the Connecticut Valley and under the ancient shell heaps of Cape Cod Mass What a long period of time it must have taken to have this art disseminated over so vast a territory at this early age According to the uses these pots were in tended for so were they made large or small thick or thin and of various shapes It was a common practice to use some sharp instrument to dint or work up some fanciful designs without ob literating the lines of the coil in some cases they are beautifully marked looking like carved black oak others made of light colored clay in very fine coils prettily indented forming neat de signs Some of the best ware is handsomely smoothed and rubbed to almost a polished surface before baking All are smoothed inside before they were dry probably some of those APRIL 7 I893

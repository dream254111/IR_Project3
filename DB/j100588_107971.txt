Experiments,i206987, 399  XIX On the Correction of a Pendulum for the Reduction to a Vacuunm together with Remarks on some anomalies observed in Pendulum experiments By F BAILY Esq FRS 8c Sfc Sc Read May 31 1832 THE great importance which has of late years been attached to experiments on the pendulum is evinced not only by the repeated and valuable labours of several of the most distingtlished mathematicians and experimentalists of the present age but also by the numerous scientific voyages that have been un dertaken by several of the European Governments with a view to ascertain and compare the results of different pendulum experiments made in various parts of the globe and thence to determine the true figure of the earth These results or the number of vibrations which are made in a mean solar day whether made by the same or by different pendulums were considered till within these few years as strictly comparable with each other by means of certain well known corrections whereby they were reduced 1 to arcs inde finitely small 2 to a common standard of temperature 30 to a vacuum and lastly to the level of the mean height of the sea M BESSEL however has recently proved that the formula for the reduction to a vacuum is very defective and Dr YOUNG has shown that the formula for the reduction to the level of the sea is in many cases too great whilst Cap tain SABINE has in a paper recently published in the Transactioils of this So ciety shown that there is reason to suspect the accuracy of the usual formula for the reduction to indefinitely small arcs This latter gentleman had pre viously in another workt pointed out the discordant results arising from the use of different agate planes with the same knife edge and had also stated his decided opinion on the powerful effect of certain geological strata in the  Phil Trans for 1831 pages 467469 t An Account of Experiments to determine the figure of the earth 4to London 1825 pages 190 and 371 3 2MR BAILY ON THE CORRECTION OF immediate neighbourhood of the pendulum and has even imagined that the results may be affected by an increase of buildings in the vicinity But to whatever cause the observed anomalies may be owing I must confess that I have myself during a long course of experiments on various pendulums at different seasons of the year and under a variety of circumstances frequently met with discordancies that have baffled every attempt at explanation by any of the known laws applicable to the subject and I believe that other persons also who have had much practice in pendulum experiments have occasionally met with anomalies for which they have been unable to account satisfactorily As it is desirable however that these difficulties should be cleared up if pos sible and as every information connected with so important a subject founded on such delicate experiments must add to our means of removing them I trust I need not apologize for drawing the attention of this Society to the re sults of some experiments made with pendulums of various forms and con struction immediately bearing on the discordancies in question In fact till we can construct two pendulums that will always tell precisely the same tale cleared of all these discordancies the important problem of the determination of the length of the seconds pendulum cannot be considered as fully solved neither can the observations of different experimentalists in dif ferent parts of the globe with different pendulums be strictly and directly comparable with each other It is true that we have two pendulums in form and construction totally different from each other whose results have been closely compared viz BORDAS pendulum and KATERS convertible pendulum But although the great accordance in those results by two such different means evince the talent and skill of the distinguished persons engaged in making the experiments yet it should now be borne in mind that the reduc tions to a vacuum were in both cases made agreeably to the old formula and that since M BESSELS important investigations on this subject which indicate the necessity of revising the computations of all preceding experi ments no rigid comparison of the results has yet been repeated The amount of the additional correction for the two respective cases varies materially as I shall more fully show in the sequel so that we are in fact at the present moment totally ignorant whether the results of any two pendulums that have ever yet been constructed are in strict and reasonable accordance with each 400A PENDULUM FOR THE REDUCTION TO A VACUUM other And until this is practically accomplished and can be practically re peated I do not think that the true length of the seconds pendulum can be considered as satisfactorily determined Reduction to a vacuum M BESSEL has shown in his very interesting work on the pendulum  that the usual formula for the reduction to a vacuum as far as the specific gravity of the moving body is concerned is very defective and by no means expresses the whole of the correction which ought to be applied in fact that a quan tity of air is also set in motion by and adheres to the pendulum varying according to its form and construction and thus a compound pendulum is in all cases produced the specific gravity of which will be much less than that of the metal itself He states page 32 that  if we denote by m the mass of a body moving through a fluid and by m the mass of the fluid displaced  thereby the accelerating force acting on the body has since the time of NEWTON been considered equal to  This formula is founded on the m presumption that the moving force which the body undergoes and which is  denoted by m  m is confined to the mass m But it must be distributed not only over the moving body but on all the particles of the fluid set in motion k by that body and consequently the denominator of the expression denotinlg  the accelerating force must necessarily be greater than n M BESSEL then enters into a mathematical investigation of the principles from which the results of his experiments are deduced and at length comes to the following important conclusion viz  that a fluid of very small density surrounding a pendulum has no other influence on the duration of the vibrations than that it diminishes its gravity and increases the moment of inertia When the in  crease in the motion of the fluid is proportional to the arc of vibration of the 6 pendulum this increase of the moment of inertia is very nearly constant in all other cases it will depend on the magnitude of that arc The obvious inference from those experiments and researches is that the amount of the correction will not only vary according to the length magni tude weight density andfigure of the pendulum but also that in the case of  Untersuchungen iiber die Lange des einfachen Secundenpendels von F W BESSEL Berlin 1828 4to This work forms part of the Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Berlin for 1826 401MR BAILY ON THE CORRECTION OF the convertible pendulum except perhaps in that particular instance when it makes the least number of vibrations possible the correction will not be the same for the two knife edges and consequently that a pendulum which has been made convertible in air will no longer be so when tried in a vacuum It becomes therefore of importance to know how far the differently con structed pendulums made use of by various experimentalists are affected by this newly discovered principle in order that their results may be strictly comparable with each other The amount of the required correction how ever cannot according to our present knowledge of the subject be deter mined by calculation but must in every case be ascertained by actual expe riment The most direct method of effecting this appears to be as M BESSEL states page 37 by swinging the pendulum in a vacuum although he him self on account of some doubts which he entertained of this method but which he has not explained adopted another and a very different plan The mode adopted by M BESSEL was of two kinds The first and principal one was by swinging in air two spheres of equal diameter about 2 14 inches but of very different specific gravity viz brass and ivory suspended by a fine steel wire the other which was not commenced till the subsequent year was by swinging the same sphere brass first in air and afterwards in water The result of the experiments by both these methods showed that the usual cor Irection for the reduction to a vacuum was much too small and that the true correction was nearly double what has been generally assumed The first method gave 1 946  and the second 1625 as the factor by which the old correction must be multiplied in order to obtain the true correction These values differ materially from each other but M BESSEL prefers the former as his investigations are founded on the theory that the vibrations are made in a medium of very small densityt Being desirous of ascertaining by a different process the true value of the correction for the numerous and various pendulums in my possession as accu rately as experiments of this kind will decide the fact and considering the  In a paper subsequently inserted in the Astronomische Nachrichten No 223 M BESSEL has in creased this value to 1956 t M BESSEL also swung a hollow brass cylinder alternately in air and in water and has deduced some results which appear to be astounding but I shall show in the sequel that the discordancy in the results stated by him will be removed by the assumption of a different specific gravity of the moving body from that which he has adopted 402A PENDULUM FOR THE REDUCTION TO A VACUUM subject to be otherwise of importance in a scientific point of view I resolved to devote some time to its examination and for this purpose caused a vacuum apparatus to be fitted up at my own house where I could pursue the subject at leisure This vacuum apparatus is very different in its form and con struction from that which is erected at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich and described by Captain SABINE in the Philosophical Transactions for 1829 page 207 It consists of a brass cylindrical tube  about five feet long and six inches and a half in diameter rounded at the bottom and soldered at the top to a thick iron frame on which the agate planes rest This frame is firmly screwed and fastened to solid mahogany beams which  are securely wedged between two fourteeninch  walls in the corner of a room which is remark able for preserving an uniformity of temperature during the day throughout the different seasons of the year The upper surface of this iron frame is ground perfectly plane and is surmounted with a moveable glass top in the manner described by Captain SABINE The brass tube has two small openings or windows cut on opposite sides at   a proper distance from the top which are cover ed with plate glass for the purpose of observing the arc of vibration and the coincidences with the clock which is placed behind The lower part of the tube is secured also by cross beams in order to prevent any lateral motion in the tube itself during the vibrations of the pendulum As the whole of the experiments about to be related are comparative only it will be unnecessary to enter more minutely into a description of this apparatus the form and construction of which will be best understood from the annexed sketch The flexible metallic pipe communicating with an air pump enters the tube immediately under the upper beams and a brass wire passing through a stuffingbox for the purpose of setting off the pendulum at any given are enters the tube just below the glass window 403MR BAILY ON THE CORRECTION OF I ought however here to mention that the agate planes are not as in Cap tain SABINES experiments screwed to the iron frame but are attached to an other solid frame of brass three quarters of an inch thick and having three footscrews for the purpose of levelling the planes These screws merely rest on the iron frame one of them in a conical hole another in a groove and the third on the flat surface of the iron frame by which means the same position is always preserved without any strain on the screws I believe that this method which was suggested by Mr TROUGHTON is as secure as where the agate planes are screwed to the frame and the application of Mr HARDYS inverted pendulum does not detect the least motion But this is a question that need not here be discussed since as I have just stated the experiments about to be adduced are only comparative The weight of this brass frame is upwards of seventeen pounds and a quarter troy The usual correction of the number of vibrations for the reduction to a vacuum has hitherto been deduced from the relative weights of the air and of the pendulum by means of the following formula viz 1 3 1 Nx s X 2 S  1 X P 1  t T t X I  t  where N denotes the number of vibrations made by the pendulum in a mean solar day S the specific gravity of the pendulum a the specific gravity of air p the expansion of mercury and ca the expansion of air for one degree of the thermometer P the height of the barometer r the temperature of the mer cury t the temperature of the air during the experiments 3 the height of the barometer and t the temperature of the air assumed as standards for the spe cific gravity If we suppose that the temperature of the mercury in the barometer is the same as that of the air surrounding the pendulum which may generally be assumed as the case in experiments of this kind without the risk of any per ceptible error the above formula may be rendered more convenient as fol lows viz  N   X 1   t 1  See M MATHIEUS paper on this subject in the Con des Tems for 826 page 288 404A PENDULUM FOR THE REDUCTION TO A VACUUM But here it will be proper to remark that S does not denote the specific gravity of the pendulum as determined in the usual manner when at rest unless the mass be homogeneous for in all other cases where the pendulum consists of several parts whose specific gravities are different we must com pute the vibrating specific gravity of the mass in the following manner Let d d di c denote the distance of the centre of gravity of each body re spectively from the axis of suspension w w w c the weighlt in air of each body s s s c the specific gravity of each body determined in the usual manner Then will the required vibrating specific gravity of the pen dulum bet w d  w d  w d  c S  wd wfd tt tt d  2 7t 7  c And it is in this manner that I have deduced what may be called the vibrating specific gravity for all those pendulums which in the following experiments consist of substances of different specific gravities With respect to the other quantities involved in the above formula 1 there are two modes which have been pursued for expressing them numerically viz one by assuming Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGHS determination of the relative weights of air and water as stated in the Philosophical Transactions for 1777  1 that is a  S   2927 and t  53 and the other by assuming the more recent determination of MM ARAGO and BIOT that is a  7  3  299218 and t  32 The former has been adopted I believe by most English experi mentalists but as I conceive the latter to be the more accurate determina tion I shall adopt it in all the present reductions They differ from each other about 1bth part of the whole correction the French result being the greatest in amount The expansion of mercury is generally assumed equal to 0001 for each de gree of FAHRENHEITS thermometer but the expansion of air is not quite so  When the body is below the axis d is plus when above it is minus t I am indebted to Professor AIRY for this formula which although of considerable importance in all investigations relative to the pendulum has not as far as I am aware been alluded to by any writer on the subject except BESSEL MDCCCXXXII 3 G 405MR BAILY ON THE CORRECTION OF well agreed upon It has generally been taken at Ath of its bulk or 002083 for each degree of FAHRENHEIT but this value applies more particularly to air rendered perfectly dry for the purpose of the experiments from which such value has been deduced The expansion of common atmospheric air impreg nated as it generally is with a certain degree of moisture is supposed by M LAPLACE to be 1uth of its bulk or 002222 for each degree x I have as sumed this latter value and consequently make a  p  0023 Whence the numerical expression for the formula in question will be 1 X 1 N x S x 770 1 99 1x  t3 3 3 If we make 3  1 and f  32 we might readily obtain for each pendulum a constant quantity  o o00 17016 CNx s  199 4 for one inch pressure of the atmosphere at the freezing point of water whence the value of the correction at any other pressure 3 and at any other tempera ture t would be denoted by c xi  03 66 o 5 This is the old correction which is so far erroneous that no account is taken of the effect of the air set in motion by and accompanying the pendulum as if adherng thereto and which is now found to influence the result very ma terially This formula however will still be of considerable service to us since not only M BEssECLS experiments but also those about to be detailed in this paper have for their object the determination of thefactor by which the quantity C must be multiplied according to the form and construction of the pendulum in order to produce the true correction this being one of the most convenient forms of showing the relative value and amount of this new in fluence I have already stated that the mode proposed to be pursued in the following experiments for the determination of this factor was to swing the pendulum under the full pressure of the atmosphere and also in a highly rare  Syst me du Monde 5th edition 1824 page 89 See also BIOTS Traitd dAstronomie Physique vol

which formula I have deduced the value of C in the experiments about to be detailed Now the value of C is always greater than C and in order to determine thefactor by which C must be multiplied in order to produce the true correc tion which factor will vary according to the form and construction of the pen dulum we must make C  n C whence we obtain for the factor required C C 8 and it is in this manner that the value of the factor n has been deduced in the following experiments And it may be proper to state that the quantity which is here denoted by n M BESSEL expresses by 1  k

CORRECTION OF of suspension or some other influential property and comprise almost every variety of pendulum that is ever likely to be made the subject of experiment In order to prevent confusion in occasionally referring to them I shall here arrange them in numerical order and class them according to their form No 1 2 3 4 are spheres of platina lead brass and ivory all of the same diameter which is somewhat less than 1 inch The platina sphere No 1 which has been kindly lent to me for the occasion by the Astronomer Royal is of French manufacture and about 144 inch in diameter which is the same size as that used by M BIOT in his pendulum experiments and in fact appears to have been formed from the same model  It is furnished with a copper calotte and also with a knife edge attached to a frame capable of being brought to a state of synchronism with the pendulum with which it is used by means of a screw in the manner described by M BORDA in the Base du Systeme M6trique vol iii page 338 Its specific gravity I found to be 21042  and it weighed 8963 grains The copper calotte weighed 87 grains and was firmly attached to the platina sphere by means of shelllac as the ordinary mode by greasing the parts failed in the present experiments I un fortunately attempted the usual nmethod in the first instance not recollecting that the adhesion is caused principally by the pressure of the atmosphere and that when that pressure is removed the sphere would no longer be sup ported This proved to be the case and the platina sphere in its fall re ceived a slight cut against the sides of the vacuum apparatus but not of suf ficient importance to impair its accuracy in any future experiments It cer tainly cannot affect the present ones which are merely comparative The vibrating specific gravity of the mass including the iron wire to which I shall presently allude was computed to be 20745 The leaden sphere No 2 the brass sphere No 3 and the ivory sphere No 4 were ordered to be made of the same size as the platina one but they are somewhat larger being 146 inch They have no calotte but were tapped for the purpose of inserting a brass screw perforated with a small hole for the insertion of the wire by wllich they were suspended The screw weighed 192 grains and the same screw has served for all the experiments where it was required except for the platina sphere The wire employed in these and all the subsequent cases unless otherwise expressed was of iron about lith of an inch in diameter and  Base du Syst6me Metrique vol iv page 449 408A PENDULUM FOR THE REDUCTION TO A VACUUIM weighed about 11 grains  its specific gravity I found to be 7666 I was un willing to use a finer wire except with the ivory sphere for fear of accidents the issue of which could not be easily remedied in the vacuum apparatus In each of these experiments the wire was attached at its upper end to the shank 155 inch long of the knife edge on which the vibrations were made in the manner described by MM BORDA and BIOT and the adjustment of this knife edge apparatus to a state of synchronism with the pendulum was always attended to The specific gravity of the leaden sphere including the brass screw I found to be 11 250 and they weighed 4648 grains of the brass sphere and screw 7660 and they weighed 3217 grains and of the ivory sphere and brass screw 1864 and they weighed 776 grains t but in all the cases where the pendulum has consisted of more than one metal or even of two pieces of the same kind of metal but of two different specific gravities the vibrating specific gravity of the mass has been deduced from the formula 2 The wire by which the ivory sphere was suspended was the finest silver wire that would sustain it with safety and weighed little more than half a grain As these three spheres are not of precisely the same dia meter I shall designate them as the 12 inch spheres No 5 6 7 are spheres of lead No 5 brass No 6 and ivory No 7 all ordered to be made of the same diameter viz 206 inches which was intended to be and is nearly the same size as the spheres used by M BESSEL  These spheres were tapped in the mnanner already described for the purpose of in serting the screw above mentioned and the same knife edge and iron wire as those above described were used in all the experiments The specific gravity of the leaden sphere and the brass screw I found to be 11281  and they  As a new piece of wire was occasionally found necessary I have given what I consider the average weight t In obtaining the specific gravities of the different substances alluded to in this paper I would observe here once for all that I used not distilled water but river water that had been filtered and boiled The values deduced are the results of two and sometimes three different weighings on different days and are sufficiently accurate for the comparisons intended They are all reduced to the freezing point of water and to 299218 inches of barometric pressure  This is the exact size of the engraving of the sphere in M BESSELS work where it is stated to be the true size but on subsequently examining the detail of the experiments I found that the correct ize is 214 inches The plate had probably shrunk in its dimensions since it had been printed 409MR BAILY ON THE CORRECTION OF weighed 13019 grains the specific gravity of the brass sphere and the screw I found to be 7995 and they weighed 9302 grains and the specific gravity of the ivory sphere and the brass screw I found to be 1747 and they weighed 20661 grains I shall designate these three spheres as the 2inch spheres No 8 9 are the same leaden and ivory spheres as No 5 and 7 but 4 the vibrations instead of being made on the knifeedge above men tioned were made by causing the wire to pass over a steel cylinder about one fifteenth of an inch in diameter in a manner somewhat similar to that adopted by M BESSEL in some of his experiments The wire used with the leaden sphere was the same iron wire as in the former experiments but that used with the ivory sphere was fine silver wire rather thicker than that used with No 4 and weighed 2 grains The experiments made with these spheres and with this mode of sus pension are not I fear entitled to much credit for reasons which I will presently explain No 10 is a solid brass cylinder 206 inches in diameter and 206 inches high in order to correspond in dimensions with the brass sphere It was tapped with a screwhole on its flat side and was supported by the same iron wire and knife edge as above described Its specific gravity with the screw I found to be 8174 and they weighed 14190 grains No 11 is the same solid brass cylinder tapped with a screwhole on its circular side but as it was liable to turn on its axis when suspended by the iron wire I was obliged to support it with a rod or piece of thick brass wire 0185 inch in diameter and 37A long  the upper end of which was attached to the knife edge above mentioned on which the T whole vibrated The rod weighed 2050 grains and its specific gravity was somewhat greater than that of the cylinder The I computed specific gravity of the whole was 8202 This pendulum was swung with its cylindrical side opposed to the line of its motion No 12 is the same solid brass cylinder supported by the same brass rod and in the same manner as in the preceding case except that it was now swung with its flat side opposed to the line of its motion No 13 is the same solid brass cylinder supported by the same F 410A PENDULUM FOR THE REDUCTION TO A VACUUIM brass rod screwed into its flat side as in No 10 an experiment made for the purpose of determining the difference in the results when suspended by the brass rod and by the iron wire See the preceding figure which exhibits this pendulum No 14 is a cylinder of lead 206 inches in diameter and 4 inches long tapped with the screwhole on its flat side and supported by the same iron wire and knife edge as above mentioned It should here be remarked how ever that this cylinder was nbt wholly of lead since it was formned of a thin brass tube filled with lead and this tube was made to slide into an outer cylinder of brass having the dimensions above described as will be more fully explained in the next article The specific gravity of the whole I found to be 10237 and it weighed 34500 grains No 15 16 17 18 are cylindrical tubes of brass 206 inches in diameter on the outside 4 inches long and 013 inch thick These however are not different tubes but consist of one and the same cylindrical outer piece and is in fact the tube into which the leaden cylinder is made to slide as men tioned in the preceding article This cylindrical outer piece is capable of being varied in the four following ways by means of an inner sliding tube No 15 is when both the ends are open with the exception of a narrow cross piece at the top to which the screw is attached No 16 is when the top is still left open but the bottom closed No 17 is when the top is closed and the bottom left open And No 18 is when both ends are closed In all the cases the tube was suspended by the same kind of iron wire as that already described and from the same knife edge The specific gravity of the metal I found to be 8453 but here it may be proper to remark what I shall again advert to in the sequel that when a hollow body is swung as a pendulum we must take into account the quantity of air contained within the moving body which in the present case is computed to be 3050 grains and diminish the specific gravity of the metal accordingly Proceeding on this principle I  Cases of this kind appear to admit of two distinctions one where the hollow body is herme tically sealed the other where the included air communicates freely with the surrounding atmo sphere and consequently escapes under the action of the airpump But in the case of a cylindrical tube like that in question there will be no difference in the result as from the similarity of distri bution of the masses of metal and of air at least in the case of the tube open at both ends and ap 411MR BAILY ON THE CORRECTION OF have calculated the specific gravities of each of these hollow pendulums as follows to which also I have annexed the weights No Spec grav Grains 15  2536   8497 16  2623   8922 17  2561  8622 18  2649  9048 After the experiments with these tubes were completed I caused the inner sliding tube to be filled with lead as mentioned in the preceding article and this solid cylinder could be readily put into and taken out of the outer tube at pleasure And when the experiments with this solid cylinder were com pleted a new top piece was made to the outer tube which was closely sol dered on a new bottom piece was also made to screw on and off which by the application of an oiled leather to the screw might at any time be rendered hermetically sealed No 19 is the tube thus hermetically sealed The inner sliding tube having been taken away the weight was reduced to 7250 grains the specific gravity I found to be 2233 The hollow portion of the cylinder now contains 3255 grains of air No 20 is a lens of lead 206 inches in diameter 1 inch thick in the middle and having a flat circumference about a quarter of an inch wide This lens was tapped with a screwhole on one of its protuberant sides and was supported by the same iron wire and knife edge as above described the position of the lens was consequently horizontal Its specific gravity with the screw I found to be 11 254 and they weighed 6505 grains proximately so in the other cases the centre of oscillation of the included air will coincide with that of the metal and the centre of oscillation of the compound mass will therefore coincide with that of the metal alone  When the bottom piece of this tube was loosely screwed so as to admit the free passage of the air under the exhausted receiver it might be considered as a pendulum similar to No 18 with the specific gravity of 2233 and when the bottom piece was wholly taken away it might be considered as a pendulum similar to No 17 Experiments were made with the tube under these circumstances to which I shall allude in the sequel fully confirming the results of the former ones In the latter case when the bottom piece was taken away the weight was reduced to 6744 grains and the spe cific gravity was computed to be 2042 The solid sliding cylinder is also adapted to this new state of the tube but at present I have not made use of it in this way 412A PENDULUM FOR THE REDUCTION TO A VACUUM No 21 is a solid copper cylindrical rod 041 inch in diameter and 588 inches long This pendulum was invented by Mr TROUGHTON and was made by him about 16 years ago when the Commissioners were appointed by Government for determining the length of the seconds pendulum It would take up some time to describe the mode in which this pendulum was originally intended to be mounted and swung and would be irrelevant to the present subject but as great part of the apparatus could be dispensed with on the present occasion the results being comparative only I shall merely state that I at first attempted to swing it by suspending it at one end with a piece of steel wire drawn close up to the cylinder mentioned in No 8 and 9 But I found the discordancies to which I shall afterwards have occasion to allude so enormous that I was obliged to abandon this mode and I ultimately fast ened it by means of an adjusting screw to the knife edge used in the pre ceding experiments As I had no means of determining the specific gravity of the rod I have assumed it as equal to that of the copper bar No 27 viz 8629 its weight is 16810 grains No 22 is KATERS invariable brass pendulum Several pendulums of this kind have been made for our own and for other Governments and for public bodies and all from the same model which is that described by Captain KATER in the Philosophical Transactions for 1819 page 341 I have two now in my possession numbered 10 and 11 belonging to the Admiralty and are those that were taken out by the late lamented Captain FOSTER in his voyage of experiment They are formed of a bar of brass 18 inch wide and rather less than ith of an inch thick At the top of this bar is a knee piece also of brass about three tenths of an inch thick to which a steel knife edge is firmly screwed and at about 40 inches from this knife edge is fastened a flat circular bob of solid brass about 6 inches in diameter and 14 inch thick but tapered at the edge Below this bob the bar is reduced to about uths of an inch in width and is continued about 161 inches thus forming what is called a tail piecea most unnecessary and inconvenient appendage since the arc of vibration which this tail piece was intended to indicate can be as readily observed by means of the edge of the bar above the bob As my vacuum apparatus was not sufficiently large to receive the bob of this pen dulum I shall deduce the results from the experiments made by Captain MDCCCXXXII 3 H 413MR BAILY ON THE CORRECTION OF SABINE on two similar pendulums with the vacuum apparatus at Greenwich as described by him in the Philosophical Transactions for 1829 page 235 The specific gravity of this pendulum I have assumed equal to 84 Captain KATER states that the specific gravity of the first pendulum which he made of this kind was 8V61 See Philosophical Transactions for 1819 page 354 but this is greater than that of any brass that I have yet found and greater I believe than what is usually met with it is even considerably more than the specific gravity of his convertible pendulum mentioned in the following arti cle which was formed of nearly similar materials and which was only 8248 Captain SABINE relying on this single experiment of Captain KATERS has assumed 86 as the proper specific gravity for a pendulum of this kind and as the results therefore which I have deduced from his experiments will not exactly agree with those that he has given it was necessary here to state the principal cause of the discordancy I estimate the weight of this pendulum at 90500 grains from the mean of the weights of two similar pendulums in my possession All the pendulums above described can be swung only in one position I now come to those which are furnished with two or more knife edges and which are of the kind called convertible pendulums The knife edges of these pendulums at least all those hitherto constructed are placed at unequal distances from the centre of gravity and consequently the same pendulum when swung with that knife edge placed uppermost which is furthest from the centre of gravity will set in motion a different quantity of air anld as far as the subject of the present inquiry is concerned produce a different result from that which would be produced when the pendulum is swung from the other knife edge I shall therefore consider these knife edges which I shall designate respectively A and B as two separate and independent pendulums the term A being applied to that knife edge which is the most distant fromn the centre of gravity and the term B to the knife edge at the other end of the pendulum No 23 24 are the two knife edges A and B of KATERS convertible pen dulum described by him in the Philosophical Transactions for 1818 page 37 the first of these letters designates the pendulum when the great weight is below and the other when the great weight is above This pendulum having 414A PENDULUM FOR THE REDUCTION TO A VACUUM been successively altered by Captain SABINE furnishes us with four separate and independent results according to its form when it was swung 1 with the wooden tail pieces 17 inches long with which it was originally furnished 2 with those wooden tail pieces reduced to the length of 64 inches 3 with brass tail pieces 7 inches long instead of the wooden ones and 4 without any tail pieces whatever and moreover deprived of the small sliding weight In this last case it was reduced to nearly the same figure and dimensions as the invariable pendulum No 22 just described but without its tail piece As my vacuum apparatus was not sufficiently large as already mentioned for a pendulum of this kind I have deduced the results from the experiments made by Captain SABINE with the same pendulum in the several states above alluded to as detailed by him in the Philosophical Transactions for 1829 page 331 c and for 1831 page 459 c With respect to the specific gra vities I must take that of the first case which was the original construction of the pendulum as equal to 7373 which is the value stated by Captain KATER in the Philosophical Transactions for 1819 page 415 But this is the specific gravity of the body when at rest deduced in the usual manner and not the vibrating specific gravity of the mass deduced from formula 2 above given and as the weights and distances of the several parts from the axis of vibration are not stated and are now completely destroyed by the alterations in the pendulum I have no means of ascertaining how far the results might be affected by this view of the subject As to the second case where the wooden tail pieces were reduced to 64 inches I have computed the specific gravity on the assumption that 7373 in the former case was correct as equal to 7909 With respect to the remaining two cases as the pendulum here con sists wholly of brass I have computed the specific gravity from the data given by Captain KATER in the Philosophical Transactions for 1818 page 63 and make it equal to 8248 Captain KATERS result is 8469 but I apprehend there must be some error in his computation The weight of the pendulum is somewhere about 66900 grains but there appears to be some confusion in the weighings In the Philosophical Transactions for 1818 page 63 the brass parts alone are stated to weigh 957 pounds which on the presumption that these are avoirdupois pounds will be equal to 66990 grains troy But in the Philosophical Transactions for 1819 page 415 the weight of the whole 3 H 2 415MR BAILY ON THE CORRECTION OF pendulum including the wooden tail pieces which would probably weigh 500 or 600 grains is stated to be only 66904 grains No 25 26 are the two knife edges A and B of a convertible pendulum formed of a plain brass bar 2 inches wide 3ths of an inch thick and 622 inches long The form and construction of this pendulum will be best  seen from the annexed sketch which is taken from the description given of the two following ones in the Philosophical Magazine for August 1828 page 137 At 5 inches from one end of the bar is placed one of the knife edges A fastened to knee pieces in the usual manner and at 394 inches therefrom is placed the other knife edge B The adjustment to synchronism is coarsely effected by filing away from the requisite end and ultimately to great exactness by means AB of a small screw inserted at the end B reduced to a weight proper for such purpose Its specific gravity as obtained from a piece of brass  said to be from the same casting I found to be 8034 its weight is 121406 grains No 27 28 are the two knife edges A and B of a copper bar similar to the last except that it is  an inch thick and 625 inches long Its specific gra vity as obtained in the manner described in the preceding pendulum I found to be 8629 its weight is 155750 grains No 29 30 are the two knife edges A and B of an iron bar similar to the copper one except that it is 621 inches long Its specific gravity as ob tained in the manner described above I found to be 7686 its weight is 140547 grains These two lastmentioned pendulums have been already described  A by me in the Philosophical Magazine as above stated They belong to the Royal Astronomical Society and are the same that were taken  out by Captain FOSTER in his late scientific voyage No 31 32 33 34 are the four knife edges A B C D of a brass bar similar to the three lastmentioned ones except that it is ths of an inch thick and 62 inches long The position of the knife edges will be best understood from the annexed diagram which is taken from the Philosophical Magazine for February 1829 page 97 where this pendulum is more fully described It may e suficient hee to this pendulum is more fully described It may be sufficient here to 416A PENDULUM FOR THE REDUCTION TO A VACUUM state that the knife edges A and C are rendered synchronous or nearly so and that B and D are also rendered synchronous or nearly so It follows therefore that each pair when properly red uced should give the same result for the length of the simple pendulum But the discordancies which they ex hibit have been already described by me in the work just quoted and have given rise to three separate papers on the subject by Captain EVEREST Mr GOMPERTZ and Mr LUBBOCK  The specific gravity of the pendulum deducedc from a piece of metal said to be from the same casting I found to be 8060 its weight is 231437 grains No 35 36 37 38 are four of the knife edges or rather planes A C a c of a brass cylindrical tube or rather tubes for it is formed of 7 different tubes drawn closely one within the other so that their joint thickness which is very firm and compact and appears as one solid body is about 013 inch The diameter is 1 inch on the outside and it is 56 inches long the ends are not closed The specific gravity of the metal I found by LA weighing a piece of the tube itself to be equal to 8406 but as the included air must be taken into account the diminished specific gravity of the moving body deduced agreeably to what is stated in page 411 will be 3034 Its weight is 81047 grains This pendulum is of a totally different construction from any hitherto made for instead of being fitted up with steel knife edges that vibrate on agate planes it is furnished with steel planes that vibrate on a pair of agate knife edges which is common to all the planes The mode of suspen K sion therefore is in this case reversed The pendulum has six planes but as two of them B and 6 have not yet been used I shall confine my remarks to the four above enumerated At the distance of 4 inches from each end of the tube is placed one of the planes fastened to a brass collar firmly fixed to the tube At 12 inches distance fromn each of these towards the centre is placed another plane  thus forming four in the whole  In this lastmentioned paper which is inserted in the Phil Trans for 1830 page 201 Mr LUB BocK has shown the effect on the number of vibrations of a given pendulum corresponding to given deviations in the position of the knife edges And the result is that no error of any considerable or even appretiable magnitude can arise from such causes when the artist uses even the most ordinary precaution in fixing the knife edges in their proper position The discordancies I believe arise from irregularities in the knife edge or planes as I shall more particularly allude to in the sequel 417MR BAILY ON THE CORRECTION OF The two planes B and b not here enumerated lie between the other pairs as will be best seen in the preceding figure The vibrations on the planes A and a are rendered synchronous or nearly so and also on the planes C and c The length between each synchronous pair of planes is as nearly as possible equal to the standard yard This completes the list of pendulums hitherto proposed or adopted for the purpose of any physical inquiry and it embraces almost every variety that has been suggested I took advantage however of the favourable opportunity that was presented for trying the effect of the pressure of the atmosphere on a few clock pendulums In these cases the pendulum was suspended by a spring in the same manner as when it is attached to the clock I shall not stop to in quire whether the arcs on these occasions diminished in a geometric ratio because as the experiments were carried on nearly under the same circum stances in each case the comparative results will be but little affected by such a consideration No 39 is a mercurial pendulum such as is now generally attached to astro nomical clocks The pendulum actually employed by me on this occasion was one that Mr HARDY was about to attach to an excellent clock which he had just made for His ROYAL HIGHNESS the President of this Society and is the first that has ever been submitted to so rigid a test It is constructed in the usual manner and similar to one described by me on a folmer occasion  except that the rod and sides of the stirrup are half an inch wide which I con sider an improvement The whole is rivetted together in a very firm manner and finished in a very superior style The height of the mercury in the glass cylinder when I swung it was 68 inches The vibrations were made as I have already observed on its own spring and not on a knife edge The weight of the mercury was 82960 grains the weight of the glass cylinder was 6463 grains and the weight of the steel parts was 13565 grains The specific gra vity of the glass I found to be 3300 and I have assumed that of mercury to be 13586 and of steel to be 7800 the vibrating specific gravity therefore of the mass deduced agreeably to the formula 2 I find to be 10591 No 40 is another clock pendulum formed of a cylindrical rod of deal about ths of an inch in diameter passing at its lower end through a cylinder of lead  Memoirs of the Astronomical Society of London vol i p 409 418A PENDULUM FOR THE REDUCTION TO A VACUUM 18 inch in diameter and 135 inches long in the manner described by me in the paper just alluded to The specific gravity of the lead I have assumed as equal to 11300 but on account of the cylindrical hole made in it and the wooden rod inserted therein I estimate the vibrating specific gravity of the mass as equal to 1 113 only No 41 is the same cylinder of lead attached to a flat rod of deal 1 inch in width and about 0 14 inch thick in the middle of its width but bevilled to a thin edge The cylindrical hole was as in the preceding case completely filled with the rod which was designedly constructed in that form at its lower end in order to exclude the air which would otherwise remain in the cylinder and thus alter its specific gravity The vibrating specific gravity of the mass is therefore the same as the preceding and it was also suspended by the same spring It was swung with its thin edge opposed to the line of motion The weight of the leaden cylinder is 93844 grains Results of the Experiments Having thus given a description of the several pendulums employed in the following experiments I shall now proceed to state the results obtained from each of themn respectively dividing them into different sets according to the form and construction of the pendulum And here I would remark that the number annexed to each result denotes the number of the experiment as given in numerical order in the Appendix to this paper where all the necessary information for obtaining the result is given in detail this mode of reference being considered preferable to an interruption of the narrative in this part of the paper I would also previously observe that in conducting these compa rative experiments I have always made them in pairs on the same day and immediately succeeding each other whereby any discordancy arising from an alteration of temperature of the room or the rate of the clock is in a great measure avoided and in continuing any series the order of proceeding has been alternately reversed which is an additional check against any error arising from a progressive but unperceived and conseqiuently unrecorded variation in the rate of the clock or the temperature of the room Thus when four experiments have been successively lade which is the smallest number employed I have swung the pendulum first in free air then after 419MR BAILY ON THE CORRECTION OF pumping out the air and the lapse of a given interval for the equalization of the temperature which is always disturbed by this process but without touch ing any part of the apparatus I have taken the second series in vacuo these two sets form one comparison On the conclusion of this series everything remaining the same and no part of the apparatus being in any way disturbed or handled I have immediately taken the third series in vacuo then after letting in the air and suffering everything to remain undisturbed as before for a given time I have taken the fourth series in free air which is compared with the experiment immediately preceding and thus forms a second com parison These four experiments thus compared give two results which are in general sufficient for the determination of the quantity sought But I have frequently repeated the process and taken four other consecutive sets in which case I have usually talen off the glass top and turned the knife edge end for end for a reason which I shall more particularly allude to in the sequel and have then conducted the new series precisely in the same man ner as the former ones The pendulum has generally been set off as nearly as possible to the same arc of vibration and continued for nearly the same length of time In short I have endeavoured as much as was in my powel to make each pair of experiments which are compared together as nearly as possible under the same circumstances in order to avoid the chance of any error or discordancy arising from any unforeseen cause First setResults with the 1 2inch Spheres I lr iCCIILCCc CcClorc oc CclCIT 1 Platina 2 Lead 3 Brass 4 Ivory Exp n Exp n Exp n

this subject are taken from my observation books in the order in which they were made 420A PENDULUMI FOR THE REDUCTION TO A VACUUM 421 The results of all these pendulums agree very well together except the brass one and seem to show that in pendulums of equal length and of simi lar construction the factor for this additional correction depends on theorm and magnitude of the moving body and is not affected by its weight or spe cific gravity The mean of the whole makes n  1864 I am unable to account for the discordancy of the brass sphere from the others unless it be in the determination of the specific gravity which is certainly less than that of any brass I have yet examined it being only 7660 from a mean of three different weighings on three different days and agreeing very well with each other If the specific gravity be assumed equal to 78 or 79 which is still small the result of this pendulum would agree with the others but I could never make it exceed 767t Second setResults

these results which though slight are worthy of notice For instance in the experiments with the lead sphere No 1720 are almost identical and so likewise are No 2124 yet differing from the former Also in the experiments with the brass sphere No 912 are almost identical and so likewise are No 1316 yet differing from the former These and other cases of a like kind are trifling anomalies for which I cannot give any satisfactory explanation t Some persons have supposed that if the ball be greased the results might be affected and if so the present discordancy may have arisen from some accidental circumstance of this kind It is pro bable also that the results may vary according to the state of moisture or dryness of the atmosphere or from some other unknown cause On these points there is certainly a wide field of inquiry open but on which at present I have not leisure to enter The true cause however of the present dis cordancy I suspect to arise from some internal cavities in the sphere indicated by the smallness of its specific gravity which are connected with the screwhole and thus suffer the escape of the included air when submitted to the action of the air pump This contingency cannot be allowed for in the computation although it may be appreciable in the result MDCCCXXXII 3 IMR BAILY ON THE CORRECTION OF If we reject the two results from the cylinder which I shall show in the sequel cannot be depended upon we shall have the mean of the rest equal to 1748 thus confirming the remark just made that the factor for this addi tional correction in pendulums of equal length and of similar construction seems to depend on the form and magnitude of the moving body and is not affected by its weight or density This result certainly does not accord with that deduced by M BESSEL from his experiments with brass and ivory balls of nearly the same size as the present ones which result I have already stated to be 1946 M BESSELS experiments appear to have been conducted with very great care and with all that accuracy and all those powerful talents for which he is so highly distinguished At the same time however I would remark that I have carefully revised all my own experiments and have not been able to discover any source of error in fact the general result is corro borated by the uniformity in the results of the experiments with the other pen dulums The subject therefore is still open for further elucidation In all M BESSELS experiments he used wires of two different lengths one being about the length of the seconds pendulum and the other differing from it the exact length of the French toise or in round numbers about 39 inches and 116 inches The value of the factor which he has deduced appears to be that which he considers common to both but it perhaps may be a question whe ther pendulums differing so much in their lengths give precisely the same value for the factor Third setResults with the 2inch solid Brass Cylinder Flat sides

very consistent with the assumption that in pen dulums of equal length and of similar construction the factor for the addi tional correction depends on the form and magnitude of the moving body Fourth

rod or wire the greater would be the value of n But it will be seen from some additional experi ments made since this paper was read and which will be given in the sequel that this is not always the case and that the present results can be satisfactorily accounted for on a totally different as sumption t The experiments with the top closed and bottom open and with both ends closed similar to those of pendulums No 17 and 18 were repeated after the inner sliding tube had been taken away and a new top to the outer cylinder had been soldered on as mentioned in page 412 and the results were as follow Top closed and bottom open Both ends closed 1977 2111 1963 2094 Mean  1970 Mean  2102 which agree very well with the preceding results I will also take occasion here to observe that having

ends be loosely closed and a free com munication left between the internal and external air due regard being had in all these cases to the correct determination of the vibrating specific gravity of the body When both ends of the cylinder are left open the effect of the air appears to be the least as in the pendulum 15 and it is increased when either the top or bottom pieces are replaced as in pendulums 16 and 17 which seems to show that some slight modification of the results is caused by leaving the ends open to the circumambient air I would observe that with the ex ception of No 14 and 19 the specific gravities of the cylinders could not be practically determined but were computed only and from assumptions rela tive to the contents of the cylinder which could not be completely verified But they are probably very near the truth and the comparative results cannot be materially affected by any error that is likely to have occurred The repe tition of three of the experiments as stated in the preceding note after the cylinder had been altered and its contents subjected to a new computation shows the degree of accordance that may be attained in these experiments If the results of the experiments with these hollow cylinders be compared with those made by M BESSEL with a hollow brass cylinder of a sonlewhat similar form vibrating in air and in water there will be found a very con siderable and remarkable difference inasmuch as he makes the value of n equal to 9 00  But on examining the steps of the process by which he deduces this value it will be easy to discover the source of this apparent dis cordancy The specific gravity of the brass of which the cylinder was formed is stated to have been 83 but by reason of the included air the specific gra interior of the cylinder in the experiment with pendulum 19 when the vacuum tube was exhausted I repeated the experiment and found the following result 2076 2160 Mean  2118 But here also from some appearances round the screw of the bottom piece I had again reason to suspect the escape of some of the air from the interior of the cylinder which may perhaps account for the slight discordancies apparent in the partial results The whole however are very satisfactory  See his work page 67 He makes the value of k from two experiments equal to 799 and 821 mean  8 100 to which unity must be added in order to obtain the value of n The diameter of M BESsELs cylinder was 284 inches and its height 320 inches 424A PENDULUM FOR THE REDUCTION TO A VACUUM vity of the moving mass was reduced to 29079 and this is the value which M BESSEL employs in deducing the results from the first set of experiments where he swings the cylinder closed first in air and afterwards in water which result gives n 1754 In the second set of experiments he takes away the bottom piece of the cylinder and having swung it first in air where the diminished specific gravity was nearly the same as before then immerses it in water whereby he says  the specific gravity of the brass about 83 is restored With this assumed specific gravity the value given by M BESSEL is certainly correct But if we suppose that the specific gravity of the moving mass is not restored to the specific gravity of the metal by suffering the tube to be filled with water and that the pendulum can be considered in no other light than as consisting of a cylinder filled with water instead of a cylinder filled with air the specific gravity of which instead of being 83 will probably not be so much as 28 the value of the result will be materially altered In fact if the specific gravity were only 25 the value of n would be only 1P85 which differs very little from the value deduced by M BESSEL froml the experiments with the closed cylinder Now I find from the data furnishled by M BESSEL that the specific gravity of the cylinder when filled with water and with the bottom piece annexed is about 28 but it is evident that when the bottom piece is taken away the specific gravity will not be so much and by the assumption of such diminished specific gravity the discordancy noticed by M BESSEL would be considerably reduced if not wholly eliminated  Fifth setResults with the 2inch Leaden Lens No 20 Exp n 105106 1614 107108 1546 Mean 1580 M BESSEL remarks that in this experiment there was a more than usual motion of the water arising from a portion of the fluid flowing out of the cylinder to supply the vacuum caused by the motion of the cylinder and the reverse But the effect of this on the general result would I appre hend be very slight In my experiments with hollow cylinders above detailed we observe but a trifling difference when the ends of the cylinder are left open 425MR BAILY ON THE CORRECTION OF The whole of the experiments with the preceding 20 pendulums were made for the purpose of determining the additional correction due to bodies sus pended by a fine wire or by a very thin rod this being one of the forms in which pendulums are constructed for the purposes of physical inquiry In the present experiments the pendulums were all nearly of the same length or about 39 inches and the results tend to show that the value of n in pen dulums of equal length and of similar construction depends entirely on the external form and magnitude of the pendulum and is uninfluenced by its weight or specific gravity But whether any portion of this result and if any how much of it is to be attributed to the wire or suspending rod  or whether it is caused wholly by the sphere or cylinder or whether the effect would be greater or less with longer or shorter pendulums or in what ratio they would be affected by such alterationsmust be left to be determined by future expe riments undertaken with a view to such special

determine some of the points here alluded to which by permission of the Council are added to this paper and will be given in the sequel They tend to open a new view of the subject inasmuch as they show that in pendulums suspended in the manner mentioned in the text the value of the factor n is affected not only by the magnitude of the sphere or cylinder but also by the magnitude and length of

of air and water whereas I have preferred in all these reductions the more recent determinations of MM ARAGO and BIOT and secondly which is the principal cause of the difference he has assumed the specific gravity of the pendulum equal to 8600 whereas I do not consider that it can be correctly assumed greater than 8400 as I have already stated in page 414 Captain SABINE made use of two different pendulums marked No 12 and 13 and the results of each accord very well together With respect to the convertible pendulum it is clear that the first deter nmination of the values of n viz 2

enumerated consisting of a lenticular shaped bob of some heavy metal suspended either by a single rod or by several comnpensation rods in which latter case it is called the gridiron pendulum As my vacuum apparatus was not sufficiently large to receive a pendulum of this kind I cannot throw any light on the pro bable value of n in these cases But as the bob of such a pendulum is not much unlike the convertible pendulum of Captain KATER when deprived of its tail pieces see the description of the pendulum No 23 in this arrangement we may form some estimate of the probable value of n when the pendulum is suspended by a single rod In the case of the gridiron pendulum however it may be a matter of doubt whether the air between the vertical rods may not diminish their specific gravity when considered as a vibrating body With respect to the leaden cylinders attached to the wooden rods it will be seen from the experiments with the pendulums No 40 and 41 that in the case of the thin flat rod the factor is greater than with the cylindrical rod contrary perhaps to what might have been anticipated e This is confirmed by a repetition of the experiment with the same cylinder and with rods of the same form as the present ones but of different materials The difference was as in the present case about 200 430A PENDULUM FOR THE REDUCTION TO A VACUUM Gezeral view of the preceding Results Having thus given the detail of the several experiments I shall bring the inean results of the whole into one general view in the following Table where I shall first give the value ofhe old corrtion for the e reduction to a vacuum for each pendulum on the assumption that the barometer stands at 30 inches that the thermometer is at 32 and that the number of vibrations in a mean solar day is in each case exactly 86400 then the value of n or the factor by which such correction must be multiplied in order to obtain the new cor rection which new correction as deduced from the preceding experiments is given in the next column To which I have added in the last column the weight of air adheriing to and dragged by the pendulum in consequence of the air put in motion thereby when vibrating in the mean state of the atmosphere above mentioned or rather the quantity of air which if applied tQ the centre of gyration of the pendulum would produce the retardation shown by the experiment This view of the subject was suggested by Professor AIRY who at the same time favoured me with the following investigation and formula for the computation of the weight of adhesive air required  Let N denote the nunmber of vibrations made by a pendulum in a mrean 6 solar day when swung in air and let v be the additional number which it  makes when swung in vacuo Also let w be the weight of the pendulum  in grains troy S its vibrating specific gravity and a the specific gravity of  the air Now since the force of gravity diminishes in the ratio of N  y2 to N2 or in the ratio nearly of I   to 1 it follows that when the pen dulum vibrates in air it is as if retaining the inertia of its weight w it  had the gravity of only w X N   w 1 N nearly or as if it had  lost the weight w X  But the weight which it has really lost from the  displacement of a quantity of air is w X T Consequently ttle portion  which is not accounted for by the mere displacement of the air is w v  T9 3K2 431432 MR BAILY ON THE CORRECTION OF  and which may be considered as the additional weight gained by the pen  dulum or rather the addition to its inertia when moving in air supposed c to be applied to the centre of gyration  This is the value given in the last column of the following Tablet Its weight is expressed in grains troy and the air is supposed to be reduced to the temperature of 32 and to the pressure of 299218 inches and its specific gravity is assumed equal to 001299   The inertia of the whole pendulum in resisting angular motion is the same as if it were collected at the centre of gyration The immediate result of the experiment and formula above  given is that the inertia of the whole pendulum ought to be increased in the proportion of 1 to  1  N s or that instead of supposing the inertia w applied at the centre of gyration the  inertiaw   N S ought to be applied there The addition to the inertia is therefore w N j  applied where that of the whole pendulum may be supposed to be applied that is  at the centre of gyration t In all the computations however instead of using the approximate value s I have taken the correct value N  v2  N2 The difference is unimportant unless the specific gravity of the penr dulum be very smallA PENDULUM FOR THE REDUCTION TO A VACUUM 433 A comparison of the Old and New Corrections fobr the reduction to a vacuum with the

page 427MR BAILY ON THE CORRECTION OF It appears from this Table that in the case of spheres whose diameters are rather less than li inch which is about the size of that used by M BORDA and by M BIoT in their experiments on the length of the seconds pendulum suspended by a fine wire the value of n may in pendulums of such length be assumed equal to 186 but that if the diameter of the sphere be increased to about 2 inches as in M BEssELS experiments the value of n will be dimi nished to 175 I regret that my vacuum apparatus is so constructed that it will not admit of my making experiments on either larger or smaller spheres or on longer or shorter pendulums otherwise I should have pursued this inquiry further in order to discover the law by which the results of pendulums so constructed are governed It will be seen likewise from a comparison of the pendulums No 10 and 13 that the size of the suspending wire or rod has a perceptible although in those particular cases not a very material effect on the results increasing the value of n as the size of the wire increases The value of n is affected also by the form of the rod as may be seen by a compa rison of No 40 and 41 to which I shall again presently allude The solid cylinder 2 inches long gives the value of n equal to 1 86t another of the same diameter and double the length gives 203 and the cylindrical tube 56 inches long gives only about 23 whilst the small cylin drical rod not much more than 4 tenths of an inclh in diameter gives upwards of 29 Other apparent anomalies will present themselves on a more minute examination and comparison of the values given in the Table which can only be cleared up by future experiments It appears also from this Table that the additional number of vibrations to be applied to the results from experiments with a platina sphere simnilar to that made use of by M BIOT will be 2395 whereas the additional number to be  I have made some alterations in my pendulum apparatus since this paper was read which has enabled me to extend the scale of my experiments as I shall subsequently state more at length t Since this paper was read before the Society I have seen the account of M BESSELS additional experiments on the pendulum in the Ast Nach No 223 From those experiments M BESSEL deduces the value of n for a cylinder very similar to that mentioned in the text equal to 1755 In this experiment the length of the wire was nearly the same as mine But for his long pendulum he makes the value of n equal to 1952 He has also slightly increased the value of n as adduced from his former experiments making it equal to 1956 instead of 1946 as already mentioned in page 402  Although this is the value to be applied to the pendulum used by M BIOT it does not follow that it would be correct to apply the same value to that used by M BORDA which was a two seconds pendulum unless it should be found that the factor is the same for long and short pendulums of this construction 434A PENDULUM FOR THE REDUCTION TO A VACUUM applied to the results from the experiments with Captain KATERS convertible pendulum knife edge A will on the assumption that the specific gravity as taken by him is correct be 8726 See page 415 So that these two pendu lums which were considered to be nearly in accordance when the old cor rection was applied for the reduction to a vacuum will now differ 6 331 vibra tions in a mean solar day from each other or T1Yth of an inch in the length of the seconds pendulum In each of these computations the pendulum is assumed as making exactly 86400 vibrations in a mean solar day It appears from the general Table of comparisons above given that the long cylindrical copper rod No 21 is the most affected by this newly discovered principle even more so than any of the spheres or cylinders suspended by wires or than the thick brass bar No 31 which presents a flat surface of i of an inch in width to the line of motion We find also that the small spheres are more sensibly affected than the larger ones which agrees with what M Du BUAT observed in the experiments made by him to which I shall presently allude But the relation between the results of the other pendu lums does not appear to me at present to be satisfactorily accounted for or to be referable to any known principle and in order to determine the effect which is produced in the results they must in all cases be made the subject of actual experiment We may however draw this inference from the whole that we cannot strictly compare the results of any invariable pendulums that have been swung in various parts of the globe without subjecting them or their prototypes to this rigid test The English pendulums have generally been made after one fashion which is that of No 22 in the above enunlera tion but I have seen some French ones of a different form where the bob has been much thicker and suspended by a cylindrical rod and which would probably give a very different value of n if subjected to actual experiment The rods of the pendulums taken out by MM FREYCINET and DUPERREY were cylindrical and about i an inch in diameter and it may be a matter of doubt whether the results with those pendulums are strictly comparable with the results obtained by pendulums of Captain KATERS construction I have already shown in the experimnents with the pendulums No 40 and 41 that a similar difference in the form of the rod only the bob continuing the same causes a difference in the result amounting to upwards of 12 vibration in a day and there may probably be other sources of discordancy which can be 435MR BAILY ON THE CORRECTION OF ascertained only by actual experiment I fear therefore that in deducing the true figure of the earth from pendulum experiments hitherto made we can compare together only those experiments which are made with precisely the same kind of pendulums If we examine the new correction for the Mercurial clock pendulum which is the pendulum now generally adopted for astronomical purposes we shall find that a difference of one inch pressure of the atmosphere should produce an alteration in the daily rate of the clock equal to Os414  which is more than double the quantity hitherto assumed as depending on the change of the barometer and which therefore can no longer be overlooked by the astro nomer In order to obviate this effect of a variation in the atmospheric pres sure on the rate of the clock at the Observatory at Armagh Dr ROBINSON has recently attached a syphon barometer to the rod of the mercurial pendulum so placed that the variations in the height of the column of mercury in the barometer may exactly compensate the effect produced by the change of atmospheric pressure Mr DAVIES GILBERT in the Supplement to a paper inserted in the Quarterly Journal vol xv has shown that the same compen sating effect may be produced by a proper selection of the arc of vibration since the effect produced by the difference of density in the atmosphere will in such case be exactly counterbalanced by the effect arising from the differ ence in the arc of vibration caused by such difference of density And pro ceeding agreeably to the formula which he has there given for finding the value of such arc and on the assumption of the accuracy of the new cor rection above mentioned I find that the value of the required arc should be 2 45 on each side of the vertical line or a total arc of 5 degrees I believe that the semi arc of vibration in astronomical clocks is seldom more than 2 degrees which produces only one half of the compensating effect above alluded to so that assuming Mr GILBERTS theory to be correct there still remains an effect on the daily rate of the mercurial clock by a difference of one inch pressure of the atmosphere of more than 2ths of a second which corresponds with the recent determinations of Dr ROBINSON from observations made expressly for that purpose  The attention of astronomers will probably in future be more particularly directed to this subject The values in the last column of the Table denoting the weight of air  See the Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society vol v p 125 436A PENDULUM FOR THE REDUCTION TO A VACUUM adhering to the pendulum supposed to be applied to the centre of gyration follow a very different march from the values of the factor n and lead to a more satisfactory explanation of the effect of the air on the motion of the pendulum For it evidently appears that the weight of air dragged by a pen dulum in mnotion depends principally on the magnitude of the moving body the inflnence of which however seems to be affected by other circumstances at present unknown so that the exact law of the variation of this influence is not sufliciently apparent from the examples adduced and further experiments are requisite to clear up this difficult but important point  Difference in the two ends of a convertible pendulum If we examine the results of the several convertible pendulums given in the above Table we shall find that the factor n is not the same for the two knife edges This has been already noticed by M BESSEL in his work so frequently alluded to and also by M POSSON in his recent paper in the Con des Tems for 1834 both of whom seem to consider that the factor ought to be greater when the heaviest end is above the axis of suspension than in the reversed position of the pendulum This however does not appear to be universally the case as will be seen by the following Table where I have given the factors for the two knife edges of the several convertible pendulums used in the pre ceding experiments together with the ratio between those factors assuming as unity the factor for the knife edge A or that position of the pendulum when the greatest weight is below the axis of suspension Factors for the correction of a convertible pendulum for the reduction to a vacuum with the ratio between the corrections for the

of this paper before the Society will be given in page 438 c MDCCCXXXII 3 L 437MR BAILY ON THE CORRECTION OF From these comparisons it appears that although in the cases of the first four pendulums the correction for the knife edge B exceeds that of the knife edge A yet in the case of the thick brass bar No 31 the corrections for the two knife edges are nearly equal and in the case of the brass tube No 35 the correction for the knife edge B is smaller than that for the knife edge A contrary to what takes place in the other pendulums and contrary to the assumed theory on the subject  M BESSEL has suggested as one of the modes of rendering the two knife edges of a convertible pendulum synchronous to make the figure symme trical but the mass not so which may be effected by making one part of the pendulum hollow In such case however we must consider the hollow portion of the pendulum as a substance of a different specific gravity and compute its effect on the vibrating mass accordingly The results also in such a case will probably differ according as the hollow portion is hermetically sealed or com municates freely with the circumambient air Additional Experiments Since this paper was read before the Society I have made a number of addi tional experiments on other pendulums of different forms and construction and have varied and combined some of the preceding pendulums in several new modes with a view to clear up the anomalies apparent on the face of the preceding experiments and to throw some light on the manner in which the air operates on the pendulum when in motion and affects the time of its vibra tions As the COUNCIL have given me permission to annex the substance of these experiments to the present paper I shall briefly state the results obtained together with such explanation relative thereto as may be requisite for under standing the mnode pursued and the consequences deduced but I have not considered it necessary to encroach on this indulgence by giving the full de tail of those experiments which however it may be proper to state have been conducted on the same principles and with the samie regard to accuracy as those already given in this paper Indeed it will be seen that there is less  Probably the position of the two additional knife edges with their kneepieces in the bar No 31 and ofe four additionalanes with th aeir collars in the tube No 35 may have some influence in producing this apparent discordancy 438A PENDULUM FOR THE REDUCTION TO A VACUUM occasion for entering so minutely into the particulars of these experiments since it will be found that the most material inferences deduced therefrom do not depend on nice shades of difference in the results of the experiments but that the cases are marked by broader lines of distinction where the probable errors of observation and of computation would not make any appreciable dif ference in the results or in the consequences to be deduced from them More over it will be seen that there is a regular march in the results of the several sets of experiments which confirms the general accuracy of the whole and it may be proper to state once for all that every value adduced is the result of at leastfour different experiments I believe it has generally been considered by persons who have paid atten tion to this subject that in all funipendulous bodies in motion the principal effect of the ail in adding to the inertia is exerted on the body attached to the wire by which it is suspended and that the wire itself which is generally the finest that can be used with safety has little or no influence in producing any alteration in the time of vibration  and consequently all their experiments and investigations have been conducted under this view of the subject This probably is not far from the truth in the most usual cases which occur and have been considered  but as it is desirable that the direct effect of the air on each portion of the pendulum should be separately and distinctly ascertained as accurately as possible for all cases that are likely to occur I instituted some new experiments with a view to determine this point In the pursuit of this inquiry I have found the suggestion and recommenda tion of Professor AIRy c to ascertain the weight of air adhering to each pen  dulum of experiment of very essential service as it has enabled me not only to mark the direct influence of the atmosphere on the pendulum much more accurately and distinctly than by merely deducing the value of the factor n but likewise to distinguish its influence on the several parts of the pendu lum In many of the following experiments the march of the values indicating such influence appears at first sight very complicated and anomalous for in some of them see the 14th set the weight of adhesive air seems to be less when the spheres are attached than when the bare rod is used and in otlers see the 19th set the weight of adhesive air dragged by a thin disc appears to increase in a most extraordinary manner merely by changing its position on 3 L2 439MR BAILY ON THE CORRECTION OF the rod But I have been favoured by Professor AIRY with the following in vestigation and remarks on this subject which will clear up these and other seeming discordancies I It appears that the phenomena to which you allude may generally be ex cc plained by supposing a quantity of air depending on the figure of the body c to adhere to it whilst it is moving and to add to its inertia without altering  its gravitation In the experiments on bodies of a simple shape the quan c tity of air is found whose inerti supposing it to adhere to the centre of gyration would account for the retardation of the pendulum see page 431 If then a compound body C consist of two parts A and B the distances of their centres of gyration from the axis of motion being respectively c a b and if  the air adhering to the centres of gyration of A and B respectively were a  and  then the compound pendulum C must be supposed loaded with the C inertia of a at the distance a and of  at the distance 6 The effect of these f a ja23 hP  would be the same as if the inertia of  were applied at the distance c If then we find as the result of experiment with the compound pendulum  C that it has from the action of the air the inertia y adhering to its centre a2  p b of gyration we obtain the equation y Whence the inertia due to B alone or 7 b   ab  10 will be the correct measure of the adhesive air dragged by that body alone We thus obtain a method of exhibiting separately the effect of the air on a sphere cylinder or other body B fastened to a rod A at any distance from the point of suspension In the subsequent Tables therefore I have annexed another collateral column indicating in each case the effect of the air or the increase of inertia due to the suspended body alone without regald to the rod deduced agreeably to the above formula I shall now proceed to the de tail of the experiments commencing with those which deternmine the effect due to the rods alone It will be seen that amongst the preceding experiments there are some made on a long brass cylindrical tube No 3538 and on a long copper cylindrical rod No 21 and that the former which is 19 inch in diameter 440A PENDULUM FOR THE REDUCTION TO A VACUUM gave a less value for the factor n than the latter which is little more than 4 tenths of an inch in diameter Conceiving therefore that I might be enabled to determine the law by which such values were governed I was induced to try other cylindrical rods supported in the same manner as the copper one above mentioned and of nearly the same length but much smaller in diameter I accordingly procured a brass rod or wire only 0 185 inch in diameter in fact it was a piece of the same kind of wire as that which was used with the solid brass cylinder No 11 mentioned in the preceding part of this paper page 410 I also caused one to be made about the same length still smaller in dia meter but as brass was not exactly suitable to such purpose when so small I procured one of steel only 0072 inch in diameter  The length of the brass rod was 564 inches it weighed 3106 grains and its specific gravity I found to be 8444 The length of the steel rod was also 564 inches its weight including a small brass screw attached to the end was 433 grains and its specific gra vity I found to be 7687 Each of these when in use was screwed into the shank of the knife edge apparatus which was 155 inch long as already described in page 409 The results are contained in the following short Table where I have continued the numbers of the pendulums from the preceding Table in page 433 for the sake of a convenient reference  No 42 being No 21 in the former list

wire such as is genlerally used in experiments with the pendulum the value of n  This was just 5 times the tliickness of the iron wire used in the preceding experiments with the pendulums No 120 t I ought not to omit stating that tllis is the mean of eight different experiments made with two different rods at two different periods Four of them viz two double ones were made with the wire here alluded to on June 14tll and the others on August 2nd with another piece of exactly the 441MR BAILY ON THE CORRECTION OF would be considerably increased But to what limit this might extend I had no means of ascertaining since the above steel wire was the finest that I could operate with for on account of its small weight a pendulum of this kind soon comes to rest and in order to guard against any probable error arising from this source I took the mean of three consecutive sets of experiments in de termining each separate result It also appears from these experiments that the quantity of adhesive air decreases as the diameter of the rod diminishes For a rod about 59 inches long and whose diameter is about 4 tenths of an inch drags with it nearly 5 grains of air whilst another rod of nearly the same length and little mnore than one sixth of the diameter drags with it scarcely half a grain But although the thicker rod drags more air than the smaller one yet the effect on the latter is much more considerable than on the former For the 4904 grains of air added to the weight of the copper rod would reduce the specific gravity of the vibrating mass from 8629 to 2939 only whilst the 0 479 grain of air added to the weight of the steel rod would reduce the specific gravity of the vibrating mass from 7687 to 1024 And these are the respective specific gravities which if used in the computations for the reduction to a vacuum would cause n to vanish  Having thus ascertained the fact that the influence of the air is greater upon small rods than upon large ones increasing considerably as the diamneter of the rod diminishes I next tried what effect would be produced by affixing various bodies to the ends of these rods For this purpose I made use of the two brass spheres No 3 and No 6 already described in the preceding part same kind of wire and having precisely the same specific gravity but about half an inch longer The results differ from each other more than I could have imagined although each set is consistent in itself for we have June 14 Aug 2 4232 3975 4179 3947 Mean 4206 Mean  3961 Weight of air  1536 Weight of air  1431 I have examined all the steps of each experiment and of the computations connected therewith but cannot detect ally source of error In fact it is one of those perplexing anomalies which occasionally occur in our researches after such minute quantities  I cannot trace the exact law of the variations in the three values in the column indicating the weight of adhesive air dragged by each rod but the nearest approximation is that the numbers are nearly in the ratio of the square root of the cubes of their diameters 442A PENDULUM FOR THE REDUCTION TO A VACUUM of this paper to which I added a third 3 inches in diameter weighing 29114 grains and whose specific gravity I found to be 8020 The ends of the brass and steel rods were screwed into the several spheres but the copper rod was attached by means of an adapting screw The re sults are given in the following Table where it will be seen that in each of the three rods the value of n is diminished by appending either of the spheres thereto The march of these values however does not appear to be very regular Indeed the conducting of the experiments when the spheres were attached to the ends of the rods required great attention on account of the slowness of the vibrations and the conse quent frequency of the coincidences with the mean solar clock with which they were compared and they may consequently be subject to some little uncertainty  In the case of the brass and steel rods the intervals of the coincidences did not exceed eleven seconds but on the other hand I sometimes took a mean of several thousand of them for the result Fourteenth setResults with the

by altering the rate of the mean solar clock which I was unwilling to disturb during the course of the present experiments t The values in the first line are the same as those given in the preceding Table and are here in serted in order to show their relative values as compared with the results when the spheres are attached to the rods This plan will be pursued in the subsequent experiments  These two experiments with the pendulums No 50 and 51 are very unsatisfactory and are marked as such in my journal It was consequently my intention to have repeated them  but the subject was overlooked till it was too late I should propose their being rejected altogether 443MR BAILY ON THE CORRECTION OF Now although there is enough on the face of the above experiments to con firm the leading principles we are in search of yet for the reasons already mentioned I should not select them as the most proper for the deduction of any very minute results when compared with others made under mlore favour able circumstances If we examine the values denoting the weight of adhesive air dragged by the compound pendulums formed of the spheres ahtached to the ends of the several rods they will be found to exhibit some apparent anomalies more especially in the case of No 45 and 48 where the weight of adhesive air seems to be less when the spheres are applied than with the plain lod But it must be borne in mind that the deduced weight of adhesive air for each pendulum is in each case supposed to be applied to the centre of gyration which is a dif ferent point of the rod in each pendulum and therefore requires correction The collateral column showing the weight due to the sphere alone agreeably to the formula in page 440 will exhibit more accordance in the results and denotes more distinctly the quantity we are in search of With a view of obtaining greater accuracy on the points in question I resolved to try the effect of placing the spheres at or near to the centre of oscillation of the rods whereby the abovementioned inconve nient change in the intervals of the coincidences would be avoided and the results rendered more trustworthy For this purpose I  divided the brass and steel rods into two unequal parts at or near to the centre of oscillation so that by screwing the longest of the two parts into the upper portion of the spheres and the shortest into the lower portion I might accomplish this object But as the whole length of the pendulum from end to end would in such case X be longer than the rods by the diameter of the inserted sphere I  cut off one inch from each part in order that the length of the pen dulum from the knife edge to its extreme end might when thus used with the different spheres be more nearly the length of the rods prior to the alteration The two parts therefore of the rods thus reduced were 364 and 180 inches respectively The copper rod was the property of Mr TROUGHTON and could not be thus divided The following are the results with the spheres thus placed 444A PENDULUM FOR THE REDUCTION TO A VACUUM Fifteenth setResults with the spheres at the centre of oscillation of the long rods Brass rod Steel rod Diameter of the

the rods also the value of n is diminished and there is moreover a greater regularity in the march of the values as the intervals of the coincidences were much more adapted for correct observation They consequently filrnish us with the means of deducing with a greater probability of accuracy the quantity of air adhering to or dragged by each of the spheres independent of the rod These values are given in the preceding Table and have been deduced agreeably to the for mula to which I shall presently allude on the assumption that the weight of air dragged by the brass and steel rods is

AIRY  Let r denote the weight of adhesive air dragged by one inch of the rod  equal in the present cases to 5 of the whole quantity dragged by these  rods as found in the 13th set of experiments  and

is the same as if the whole quantity of  air r y x r y had been attached at the distance 3    which in  fact is the distance of the centre of gyration of that rod from the axis of motion The effect of the air adhering to several such rods will be repre sented by 3 y  x3 Therefore the ratio which such quantity will bear  to that carried by a rod of the length of the whole rod if in one uninter  rupted piece from end to end of the given pendulum will be as  2 y3 3 to T Y3  X3 where X and Y are the distances from the knife edge of  the extremities of the whole rod whence the weight of adhesive

experiments and in general for the lively interest which he has taken in this inquiry without which encouragement I certainly should not have extended the subject to its present length F It is in this manner that I have computed the weight of adhesive air due not only to the spheres in this set of experiments but also to the cylinders and discs in the 7th 18th and 19th sets of experimentsA PENDULUM FOR THE REDUCTION TO A VACUUM The values above given are nearly although not exactly in proportion to the cubes of the diameters but it is possible that some other element at present unknown may affect the results and indeed some portion of the air may adhere to or be dragged by the sides of the sphere As the exact measure of these three brass spheres was however a matter of importance in this inquiry I exa mined them more minutely and found them to be 1465 2065 and 3 030 inches respectively So that the weight of adhesive air for the last two spheres will be almost exactly as the cubes of their diameters and for the first two not materially differing therefrom In fact if the weights of air were 387 1084 and 39422 grains respectively the whole would agree precisely with this hypo thesis It is worthy of remark that in the case of the spheres No 1 to 7 sus pended by a wire see the Table in page 433 and No 66 in the following set if we consider the weight of air dragged by the wire alone as equal to 0 10 grain and deduct this value successively from the mean weight of air dragged by the 146 and the 206 inch spheres respectively as there given and by the 303 inch brass sphere as given in the following set of experiments we shall have 0373 1040 and 3A444 grains for the weight of air dragged by the spheres alone So that on the whole I consider the hypothesis adduced as not far from the truth and that the general expression for the quantity of air dragged by a pendulum consisting of a sphere suspended by a rod or wire will be as follows viz grains n  0123 X d3 where d denotes the diameter of the sphere in inches and R the quantity of air dragged by the rod or wire And if in the case of a sphere suspended by a fine wire of the length of the seconds pendulum we suppose R to be as already stated equal to 010 grain this formula will become 002564  123 d3 where I denotes the length of the wire in inches These values do not differ materially from those obtained by the same spheres attached to the ends of the long rods as given in the 14th set of expe riments but I have already stated that those results were obtained under less favourable circumstances and are not to be relied on with the same degree of confidence as the present set They will be found however to accord more 3M2 447MR BAILY ON THE CORRECTION OF nearly with the following set of experiments where the spheres are attached to the ends of the short rods I next took away the lower rod from the spheres and they were then at tached to the upper rod only whereby the pendulums became nearly of the same length as No 3 and No 6 mentioned in the preceding part of this paper with the results of which it was my object to compare them And as the 3 inch brass sphere had not yet been swung with the iron wire I now made some experiments with this mode of suspension for the express purpose of the comparison The following are the results Sixteenth setResults with spheres at the

shall find that as far as the value of n is concerned it is with one slight exception greater in long pendulums than in short ones but the difference appears to depend chiefly on the relative magnitudes of the spheres and of the rods With respect to the weight of adhesive air I regret that I could not conveniently swing these short rods without the spheres attached thereto which would have enabled me to ascertain agreeably to the formula in page 440 whether the weight of air adhering to or dragged by each sphere respec tively is the same in this set of experiments as in the preceding set But if we suppose that the weight of air dragged by these short rods is proportional to their lengths and employ such quantities in the formula above mentioned  The iron wire used with this heavy sphere was 023 inch in diameter or about one third of the thickness of the steel rd and nearly tice he thickness of the wire used in the experiments wit the pendulums No 1 to No 20 It weighed 26 grains 448A PENDULUM FOR THE REDUCTION TO A VACUUM we shall find that the weight due to the spheres alone when attached to the brass and steel rods will be as stated in the preceding Table The values annexed to the spheres when suspended by the iron wire are deduced frotn the assumption that the weight of the air dragged by the wire is equal to 010 grain as already stated These values like most of those deduced from the 14th set of experiments agree very well with those which result from the spheres when annexed at the centre of oscillation and the whole show that the effect of the air on a pendulum consisting of a sphere suspended by a fine rod or wire although principally due to the sphere is partly owing to the wire also  but that this influence of the wire diminishes with its diameter and when extremely fine probably becomes a small constant quantity of nearly equal value in the most usual cases that occur In order to place the subject of this inquiry in a clearer point of view with respect to other bodies I caused three additional brass cylinders to be made which with the cylinder No 10 described in the preceding part of this paper were proposed to form the subject of a new set of experiments The diameters of all these cylinders were ordered to be made exactly alike viz 206 inches and their respective heights or thicknesses were 206 inches 100 inch 050 inch and 0 18 inch This latter thickness was chosen on account of its being precisely the diameter of the brass rod The 1 inch cylinder weighed 6611 grains and its specific gravity I found to be 7805  the r inch cylinder weighed 3352 grains and its specific gravity I found to be 8116 and the 18 inch cylinder weighed 1266k grains and its specific gravity I found to be 8 145 The other cylinder has been already described All these cylinders were tapped in the circumference with two screw holes opposite to each other for the purpose of affixing thereto the two unequal portions of the rods above mentioned whereby the cylinders became placed nearly in the centre of oscil lation of the whole length of the rod The cylinders thus placed were swung with their flat sides vertical and opposed to the line of motion similar to the  This appears from the slight difference in the quantity of adhesive air dragged by the steel rod and iron wire in this set of experiments which is very small And moreover in the case of the ivory sphere No 4 which was suspended by a very fine silver wire the result is precisely the mean of the other spheres which were suspended by the much coarser iron wire 449MR BAILY ON THE

increase in the value of n as the thickness of the cylinder diminishes till it approaches nearly equal to the thickness of the rod itself when the effect of the cylinder on the value of n is eliminated and the result is the same as if no cylinder were attached to the rod Pass ing this point and the thickness of the cylinder becoming equal to or less than the diameter of the rod the effect of the cylinder becomes positive and the value of n is now greater than when the rods are swung without any thing attached thereto Setting aside however the value of n and confining our attention to the quantity of air adhering to or dragged by these pendulums we find that it varies with the thickness of the cylinders And pursuing the same steps as in the case of the spheres see page 446 we obtain the values above given for the weight of air due to the cylinders alone and which are more conveniently arranged in the following form viz  See the first note in page 443 It must be noted here that in the first horizontal line no cylin der is supposed to be attached to the rod and therefore these values are not directly comparable with the rest 450A PENDULUM FOR THE REDUCTION TO A VACUUM The djfferences between these mean values would indicate the quantity of air dragged by the sides of a cylinder of this diameter according to its thickness but which does not appear to be very regular in its march since the thin cylinders drag more in proportion than the thicker ones Till this fact is more fully ascertained we cannot deduce a correct general formula for determining the quantity of air dragged by cylinders of different diameters and thicknesses swung in the manner above mentioned The next set of experiments were made with thin circular discs of brass having about the same thickness as common thick post paper Twenty pieces screwed together in a vice measured 08 inch consequently the thick ness of each of the brass discs may be assumed equal to 004 inch One of these discs was intended to be 206 in diameter in order to correspond with the cylinders above mentioned but it is in fact somewhat larger being 207 and weighs 28 grains the second was 301 inches in diameter and weighed 575 grains and the third was 4 inches in diameter and weighed 1065 grains Their specific gravity I found to be 8450 The long brass rod above mentioned was then tapped with a screw hole at 38 inches from the knife edge and the three discs in succession were respectively fastened thereto and swung with their flat sides opposed to the line of motion The long steel rod could not be used on this occasion not only because the discs could not be conveniently attached thereto but also on account of its coming to rest so soon  This was the second brass rod 5669 inches long mentioned

of the disc increases If we examine the values in the last column in computing which the quantity of air dragged by the rod has been assumed of a different value in each case or proportionate to the length of the rod minus the diameter of the disc we shall find that the quantity of air dragged by these thin discs is also nearly in the ratio of the cubes of their diameters and the general expression for the amount of the same will be nearly grains R  0149 d3 R and d denoting the same quantities as before With a view of following up this inquiry relative to the discs I caused the same brass rod to be tapped with 3 other screw holes one at 51 inches from the knife edge being the highest point to which I could fix anything another at 300 inches from the knife edge or near the centre of gravity of the rod and the other at 573 inches from the knife edge or near the lower end of the rod The thin brass disc 207 inches in diameter was then successively fast ened to the rod at each of these distances and swung in the same manner as in the preceding set with the flat sides opposed to the line of motion The following are the results including that of No 75 given in the preceding set

weight of adhesive air appear at first sight very ano malous especially when we consider that the vibrating specific gravity of the mass and the weight of the pendulum are exactly alike in each case But it should be remembered that these weights of adhesive air are supposed by the formula in page 431 to be applied to the centre of gyration and if we wish to determine the effect due to the disc alone we must have recourse to the for mula in page 440 It is in this manner that I have obtained the results given in the last column of the preceding Table under the head of  Weight due to the disc alone The mean of the last three values gives the weight of air due to the disc alone equal to 1387 grain I have not included the case where the disc was only 51 inches from the knife edge since no dependence can be placed on the result on account of the magnitude of the multiplier In fact if the weight of adhesive air at that point of the rod were only 1466 instead of 1523 the weight due to the disc alone would correspond with the mean of the rest As I was desirous of varying these experiments as much as possible I next tried the effect of two of the thinnest of the cylinders above mentioned having the same diameter as the disc used in the preceding set of experiments whose thickness was respectively 018 and 050 inch in order to see whether they would exhibit the same law The cylinders

but here I should repeat the remark already alluded to in page 444 In fact on referring to the observation book I find that the intervals of the coincidences were only 14 seconds and I fear that a sufficient number of theni were not taken to insure that degree of accu racy which is requisite in such minute inquiries I should therefore give the preference to the preceding set of experiments The next and last class of experiments was necessarily very limited as from the construction of my vacuum apparatus I could not conveniently ex tend them so far as I could wish They were instituted for the purpose of determining the difference between the results of the brass cylinders and the thin brass discs swung edgeways and the results when swung in the manner already described namely with theirftat sides opposed to the line of motion The two cylinders used in the preceding set and the two discs respectively 207 and 301 inches in diameter were chosen for this purpose The two cylin ders were screwed as before to the end of the long brass rod in order to compare their results with the preceding set but the two discs were screiwed to the brass rod at 38 inches from the knife edge in

the moving body drag with them very little of the air which has so remarkable an effect on the pendulum In this last set the discs were placed as in the 18th set at 8 tenths of an inch above the centre of oscillation In making the computations for the weight due to the disc alone this has been allowed for and I wvould also observe that the whole effect of the rod has been used in those computations as it is evident that the position of the disc does not obstruct any part of its action on the air General results of the Additional Experiments I must here close the account of these additional experiments which have been pursued up to the latest moment that could be conveniently spared by the printer as I was desirous of communicating at once all the information I could procure on this interesting subject and which consequently leaves me only time to offer a few brief remarks on the results obtained  See the first note in page 443 3N2 455MR BAILY ON THE CORRECTION OF It appears then that all these results accord with the theory that a quantity of air adheres to every pendulum when in motion and by thus forming a portion of the moving body diminishes its specific gravity or rather adds to its inertia This adhesive air is confined almost wholly to the two opposite portions of the pendulum which lie in the line of its motion similar to what takes place with a body moving through still water and very little of it ad heres to or is dragged by the sides of the pendulum The shape of this coat ing of air will consequently partake in some measure of the form of the pen dulum subject probably to some slight modifications with the nature of which however we are at present unacquainted The quantity of air dragged by a pendulum seems to depend on the extent and form of surface opposed to its action and is not affected by the density of the body In the case of a sphere 1 inch in diameter suspended by a fine wire the weight of air dragged by the sphere alone appears to be about 0123 grain troy and for spheres of any other diameter in nearly the direct ratio of the cubes of their diameters The weight of air dragged by the wire of the length of the seconds pendulum may amount to 010 grain but probably does not exceed that quantity and perhaps is nearly constant for alljine wires of that length so that with small sphieres less than 1 inch in diameter the weight of air dragged by the wire is nearly the same as that dragged by the sphere With respect to cylinders suspended by rods and swung with their flat sides opposed to the line of motion the law of the variation is not so manifest as we are at present ignorant of the precise effect caused by the edge of the cylin der Neither have we obtained sufficient data to develope the effect of the air on cylinders suspended by rods or wires and swung with their flat sides in a horizontal position similar to the pendulums No 10 and 14 In these cases see page 433 the 4 inch cylinder drags much more than double the quantity of air adhering to the 2 inch cylinder although they have precisely the same diameter And these are the only experiments which I have made connected with this branch of the subject With respect to very thin cylinders or discs swung with their flat sides opposed to the line of motion the weight of air dragged by a disc of 1 inch in diameter appears to be about 0149 grain and for discs of any other dia meter nearly in the direct ratio of the cubes of their diameters Whence it appears that a thin disc drags more air than a sphere of the same diameter 456A PENDULUM FOR THE REDUCTION TO A VACUUM As the quantity of air dragged by spheres is proportionate to the cubes of their diameters I was induced to examine whether the quantity dragged by a sphere and by a cylinder of the same diameter and height would be propor tionate to their solid contents or in the ratio of 1 to 12 But from a com parison of pendulums No 6 and 10 see page 433 it appears that the cylinder drags more than that proportion by about th part of the whole If we compare the results of pendulums No 10 and 13 see page 433 the difference in the quantity of air dragged would appear to be that which is due to the difference in the effect produced by the wire and the rod But we must bear in mind what has been stated in page 440 relative to bodies suspended at the end of a rod or wire and reduce them by the formula there given to the same point in which case the weight of adhesive air due to the cylinder alone would be very nearly alike in both experiments From a review of the whole it appears that even when a pendulum is formed of materials having the same specific gravity yet if it be not of an uniform shape throughout each distinct portion must be made the subject of a separate computation in order to determine the correct vibrating specific gravity of the body since each part will be variously affected by the circumambient air As an example take the case of the pendulum No 3 where the iron wire and the brass sphere have almost exactly the same specific gravity viz 766 If we suppose the sphere drags 0A40 grain of air and the wire 0 10 grain or about 4 of that dragged by the sphere we shall have the specific gravity of the sphere with its coating of ailr educed to about 443 and that of the wire with its coating of air to about 014 Whence the vibrating specific gravity of the whole pendulum deduced agreeably to the formula 2 in page 405 will be about 421  which would give the reduction to a vacuum equal to 13380 seconds differing very little from the true correction given in the Table in page 433 If the effect of the air on the wire had been neglected this value would have been diminished about one second which shows that in making experiments on pendulums of this kind in water the whole of the wire should be immersed in the fluid in order to deduce correct results In concluding these experiments I cannot flatter myself that no error has escaped me especially when I consider the vast number of computations which have been employed in these investigations The major part of them 457MR BAILY ON THE CORRECTION OF however have been revised especially those which exhibited aniy remarkable anomaly and I trust that no error of importance will be found to exist During the progress of the experiments the apparatus has been from time to time altered in order to suit the circumstances of the case and trifling differ ences of specific gravity and of comparative lengths and weights arising there from may consequently have passed unnoticed and unobserved Indeed the subject has been altogether so new that in commencing a set of experiments I was not always aware of the precise points to which it was most necessary to direct the attention and which were not sufficiently apparent till after the result was obtained Should it however be desirable to repeat any of these experiments in a manner that may be considered likely to lead to more accu rate results I shall be happy to resume the enquiry The Chevalier Du BUATS Experiments During the course of these enquiries it will be seen that I have all along considered M BESSEL as the first discoverer of that peculiar property of the moving pendulum which it has been the object of this paper to elucidate  and undoubtedly he is entitled to the merit of havingfirst applied those principles which he has investigated with so much accuracy and with such great ability to the modern pendulum and thus rendered it a more powerful and delicate instrument in the hands of the practical and theoretical philosopher But it hlas recently been found that this same property of the penduluin was known inearly fifty years ago and distinctly treated by the Chevalier Du BUAT in his Principes dHydraulique In that work the second edition of which appeared in 1786  the author has stated the results of a number of experiments on pen dulums of various kinds swung in air and in water from which he was led to infer that a quantity of the fluid in which the pendulum oscillates is dragged with it in its motion and thus retards its vibrations He remarks that  if a  denotes the length of a pendulum making any number of vibrations in vacuo  Ithe length of a pendulum nmaking the same number of vibrations in the  fluid p the weight of the moving body in the fluid P the weight of the fluid  The first edition 1779 does not contain the experiments here alluded to 458A PENDULUM FOR THE REDUCTION TO A VACUUiM  displaced by the body then p  P will express its weight in vacuo and   will be the ratio of gravity in the two cases whence we obtain laX p  dragged with it  He then proceeds to show page 229 that if n be any i constant number such that n P expresses in all cases the weight of the fluid  displaced and also that of the dragged Jfluid the mass when in motion or its weight in vacuo is no longer p  P but is represented byp  n P  whilst  its weight in water is always expressed by p The correct formula therefore  will be la X P pnP whence we deduce n  P   I M Du BUAT then gives the result of 44 experiments made by swinging pen dulums formed of spheres of lead glass and wood of different weights and sus pended by lines of different lengths and the conclusion at which he arrives is that the value of n which in his experiments varies with only 4 slight ex ceptions from 167 to 145 may be assumed equal to 1585 f This certainly agrees with the fact much more nearly than might be expected from the rough manner in which those enquiries were conducted as compared with more modern experiments And although it cannot be placed in competition with the more rigid investigations of M BESSEL or the results detailed in this paper yet it evinces the great talent and zeal of the author in being able to extract so near an approximation from such a mode of procedure M Du BUAT then gives the result also of a vast variety of similar experiments on cylinders prisms cubes c and found in each of them a complete confirma tion of his opinion relative to the dragging of the fluid in which the vibrations  Edition 1816 vol ii page 226 t Ibid page 257 459M1R BAILY ON THE CORRECTION OF were made And although he remarks that the above mean value of n is given as generally suitable to all cases of spheres yet he suspects that the quantity of drraggedfluid is rather less with large spheres than with small ones and also that it is rather less for short pendulums than for long ones  But is it not a remarkable circumstance in the history of this subject that these important and apparently conclusive experiments of M Du BUAT which were made by the order and at the expense of the French Government which were examined at the request of the Minister of War by the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris and by them favourably reported on which were first published in the year 1786 little more than 10 years prior to the experiments of M BORDA on e e the length of the pendulum t and which excited so much interest that they led to the subject for the Prize re Essay proposed by the Academy in the follow ing year and which not being answered was repeated in the year 1791 with the offer of a double rewardexperiments which attracted at that time so much public attention that another edition of the work appeared in 1816 just about the time when the subject of the pendulum was revived in the different states of Europe which has not only been translated into the German lan guage T and praised in the highest terms by some of their principal writers on that subject but has been also largely quoted in many English works and freely commented on in this country is it not singular that such experiments should have been so soon and so completely lost sight of and forgotten that not one of the many distinguished individuals actually engaged in those pursuits and in the investigation of this subject should have had the least idea or remem brance of the additional correction for the reduction to a vacuum so clearly pointed out by M Du BUAT and that until the rediscovery of this principle by M BESSEL as detailed in his valuable paper on the pendulum no one should  The first suspicion is verified by th2 present experiments at least in the light in which M Dv LTJAT viewed the subject For though the quantity of dragged fluid is greater with large spheres than with small ones yet the factor n which he appears to have considered its index is less The second suspicion is also confirmed not only by some of the present experiments but likewise by those of M BESSEL alluded to in the note in page 434 f I am unable to fix the precise date of M BORDAS experiments for although the month and the day as well as the exact time to the nearest second are minutely recorded I have not been able to detect the year in which they were made  By J F LEMPE Leipsic 1796 See also the works of LANGSDORF and others 460A PENDULUM FOR THE REDUCTION TO A VACUUM have thought of verifying the suspicion of NEWTON that such an effect was pro bable X M PRONY in his Nouvelle Architecture Hydraulique and Dr YOUNG in his Lectures on Natural Philosophy both of whom have taken an active part in the investigations relative to the pendulum make frequent allusions to Du BUATS work yet neither of these distinguished mathematicians appears to have recollected the singular facts recorded by that author And even in M POISSONS late excellent memoir inserted in the Connaissance des Tems for 1834 although in the Appendix thereto the authors attention has been called to M Du BUATS experiments by a notice fiom another quarter yet it is evi dent that when that distinguished mathematician commenced his paper he was not aware of the facts stated in M Du BUATS work as he frequently and very justly alludes to M BESSEL as the first person who had directed the attention of the public to the true correction And it certainly is but a poor consolation to the practical philosopher who thus devotes so much of his time to the elucidation of any particular branch of science to find that his labours may be so soon forgotten and probably lost sight of for ever Suspension over a Cylinder The principal portion of M BESSELS experiments on the pendulum were made by suspending the sphere by means of a wire over a steel cylinder not more than 088 of an inch in diameter Being desirous of pursuing the same plan with respect to some of the pendulums which are the subject of this paper I suspended the lead and ivory spheres No 8 and 9 in this manner the results of which have been already stated I proceeded in a similar manner with some of the other pendulums but in the course of the experiments I dis covered some anomalies for which I could not at first satisfactorily account and at length found that they proceeded altogether from the mode of suspension In the long cylindrical rod No 21 the discordancies were the most apparent for not only would the intervals of consecutive coincidences differ from one another as much as 60 70 and in one case as much as 90 seconds plus and minus but the arc also would be continually varying in magnitude in a similar manner alternately diminishing and increasing With a view to discover the cause of these singular anomalies I erected an apparatus for more minutely  Principia lib ii prop 27 cor 2 MDCCCXXXII 3 o 461MR BAILY ON THE CORRECTION OF observing and watching the otion of the tpendulum during its vibrations and I found that when the sphere was suspended by a wire over a cylinder the motion of the ball although set off in a straight line soon became ellip tical  that the eccentricity of the ellipse was continually diminishing and that the major axis was continually shifting its position with respect to the points of the compass circumstances which were sufficient to account for all the appearances above described and to destroy all confidence in experiments conducted in such a manner And although I have retained the experiments with the penduluns No 8 and 9 above alluded to which were made in this way yet it has been more to show the near accordance which may sometimes be accidentally attained by an incorrect method and that we cannot examine too minutely into every step of so delicate an inquiry I wish it however to be fully understood that these remarks do not apply to M BESSELS experiments since there is this important distinction to be made between his mode of proceeding and mine viz that his wire at the part where it passed over the cylinder was purposely made flat probably with a view of avoiding this very difficulty whereas mine was round as generally sold in the shops I have not yet tried theflat wire but have thought it right to point out the inaccuracies that may attend the use of the round wire in order that others may not adopt it without the precaution of first ascertaining how far the results of any experiments may be affected by the anomalies above alluded to In conclusion I would add that in the knife edge suspension the vibra tions of the ball were uniformly preserved in a straight line during the whlole time it was in motion and no anomalies were discoverable Confined space of the Vacuum apparatus It has been suggested by some persons that the results of experiments of the kind mentioned in this paper may probably be affected by the confined space of the tube in which the oscillations of the pendulum are made M PoIssoN in his valuable memoir above alluded to has justly stated that in all the analy tical investigations the oscillations are supposed to be made in a fluid which extends indefinitely in all directions a circumstance however which cannot practically take place in experiments of this kind But he imagines that when the pendulum is small in comparison with the dimensions of the inclosed 462A PENDULUM FOR THE REDUCTION TO A VACUUM space the results are not sensibly affected and that they are least so when the surface of the confining body is curved In the Greenwich vacuum apparatus where the tube is about 13 inches in diameter Captain SABINE did not find any difference in the results of some experiments instituted for the express purpose of ascertaining the same although the bob of his pendulum was 6 inches in diameter In my own apparatus also I have found the results of numerous experiments with the bar pendulums within the tube agree very well with those in free air before the vacuum apparatus was erected and cer tainly no discordance has been observable sufficient to warrant any material alteration in the results of the present experiments In the Greenwich appa ratus the glass cylinder is formed of three separate pieces which may be easily taken apart and the pendulum may thus be at any time exposed to the free air whereby the experiments may be alternately made in the confined cylin der and in the free air But my apparatus consists of one uniform brass tube and is not adapted to such a change of experiments Anomalies of the knife edge suspension It has been shown by Captain SABINE in his Account of Experiments c page 195 that in a pendulum with knife edges a considerable difference may arise in the results if they be used with different planes but it does not appear to have occurred to any one versed in these experiments that a much greater difference than that which he has recorded may arise from using the same knife edge with the same plane This fact has probably hitherto escaped de tection from the peculiar manner in which pendulum experiments are usually conducted for on examining the detail of most of those experiments it will be found that after the pendulum at any one station has been placed in its Ys it has never been removed therefrom but merely raised and lowered again as occasion may require till it has been ultimately dismounted and packed up for another station  whereby any anomaly that might otherwise have occurred is thus avoided and consequently escapes detection Experiments however of this kind ought to be varied in every possible way in order to guard against any unsuspected source of error When Captain BASIL HALL returned from his voyage to the Pacific Ocean where he had undertaken to swing the penidulum at various places it was 3 o 2 463MR BAILY ON THE CORRECTION OF found that the number of vibrations which the pendulum made on his arrival again in London differed by 097 or not quite a second of time in a mean solar day from the number of vibrations nlade by the same pendulum previous to his departure and various causes were assigned for what was called so great and so singular a discordance  for I believe at that time the results with the invariable pendulum were considered almost as infallible It is true that we have a few instances of a contrary nature where the pendulums on their return home have told precisely the same story as they did when they were sent off and in the case of the two pendulums that were taken out by Captain SABINE their coincidence during the whole of the voyage was very re markable since the greatest variation from the mean did not exceed 032 at any one of the stations  but these I consider rather as singularly favourable circumstances in his particular case than as tending to invalidate the results of other experiments In the voyage of Captain FREYCINET who took out three separate pendulums we find a variation in the difference between them amounting to several seconds in a day Thus at the Isle of Guam the differ ence between pendulums No 1 and No 2 was 1180 162 vibrations whereas at the Isle of Rawak the difference was only 1173693  being a variation of 6A469 vibrations At the Isle of France the difference between pendulums No 2 and No 3 was 1012326 vibrations whereas at the Isle of Rawak the difference was only 1008557 being a variation of 3769 vibrations And at the Isle of France the difference between pendulums No 1 and No 3 was 164948 vibrations whereas at the Isle of Guanm the difference amounted to 169833 being a variation of 4885 vibrations in a mean solar day  Captain DUPERREY also who took out two of these same pendulums No 1 and No 3 in a subsequent voyage found the difference between them at the Malouine Islands to be 169931 vibrations whereas on his return to Paris the difference was only 168235  being a variation of 1P696 vibration 9 Now in all these cases there ought to be little or no variation in the difference between any two of the pendulums neither would there be if we could insure the making of the experiments precisely under the same circumstances and no blame can  Phil Trans for 1823 page 287 t Account of Experiments c page 189  Voyage autour du Monde par M FREYCINET Observations du Pendule

for carrying on such delicate experiments In fact amongst the multitude of experiments that I have myself made I have seldom found after I had dismounted a pendulum and then replaced it even on the same day under all the favourable circumstances of equality of temperature c and with all the conveniencies of manipulation that I could make it tell the same story in the next series of experiments Even the same pendulum furnished with two different knife edges rendered synchronous or nearly so similar to those described in the above enumeration as convertible pendulums No 25 38 where the trifling difference in the results of each pair of knife edges ought after proper reductions to be a constant quantity will frequently differ by an amount much greater than can be attributed to the errors of obser vation The fact I believe to be that the pendulum furnished with a knife edge and agate planes as at present constructed is a very inadequate instrument for the delicate purposes for which it was originally intended and a more rigid exa nmination and adjustment of that part of the instrument are requisite before we can depend on the experiments made with it either for the determination of the length of the seconds pendulum or even for the comparison of results obtained in different parts of the world The knife edge is seldom or never perfectly straight the planes are seldom or never perfectly true at least I have never found one so amongst the number of those on which I have experi mented The consequence is that as there is generally a little play in the Ys the knife edge is not always let down on the same parts of the agate plane This may be best detected by holding a lighted candle behind the knife edge when it is resting on the plane by which method the smallest inequalities in the points of contact are readily discernible But the fact is rendered still more evident by reversing the pendulum in the Ys when a sensible difference in the result generally takes place Amongst the numerous pendulums in my possession I have not met with more than one that does not differ in the results by an appreciable quantity when the pendulum is reversed in the Ys or turned half round in azimuth If the knife edge and planes were perfectly correct and true there ought not to be any difference in the results whichever side of the pendulum is placed fronting the observer how then are we to 465MR BAILY ON THE CORRECTION OF account for a difference of upwards of two vibrations in a day which actuallv occurs in one of the pendulums above alluded to  The following Table how ever will set this matter in a clearer point of view and show the real differ ences which I have found to take place in the results merely by reversing the face of the pendulum The numbers in the first column have reference to the enumeration of the pendulums in the preceding part of this paper The brass bar 3 of an inch thick was swung on two different agate planes and the

experiments here alluded to were made for the express purpose of detecting any discordance arising from the position of the knife edges on the agate planes they were at first followed up as far as each pendulum is con cerned in immediate succession alternately turning the face of the pendu duin at the end of each experiment It is needless to swell this paper with a detail of the whole of the experiments that were made on these occasions but as the 10th case above enumerated the iron bar No 30 knife edge B affords so remarkable a discordance I trust I may be excused for putting on record the steps of the process by means of which the results may be verified at pleasure The magnitude of the discordance like the case already mentioned in page 461 was the cause of its detection which may therefore be considered as accidental but the discovery of the anomaly led me to suspect that it 466A PENDULUM FOR THE REDUCTION TO A VACUUM might also take place in other pendulums which from repeated trials as above stated I found to be the case And this furnishes us with another proof of the propriety of varying such experiments in all manner of ways in order to guard against the effect

86220465 86222503 It may here be stated that the knife edges of all the convertible pendulums in my possession are marked on both sides of the pendulum on one side with the capital letters A B and on the reverse side with the small letters a b Therefore the column in the above Table designated as the knife edge B denotes the results obtained when the side of the pendulum marked B is next to the observer and the other column denotes the results when the pendulum is turned half round in azimuth and consequently the side marked b is next to the observer The mean difference in the results will be found as already stated equal to 2038 vibrations in a mean solar day If we compare the several results we shall find the partial differences somewhat greater than what generally occur in a regular series of experiments but these have arisen froni designedly varying the position of the knife edge on the agate plane with a view to the discovery of the cause of the principal discordance and which I can attribute to no other source than inequalities in the knife edge or agate plane or both but which are not immnediately perceptible to the eye From 467MR BAILY ON THE CORRECTION OF a review of the whole question however it is clear that different experiments even with the same pendulum are not strictly comparable with each other unless we can either ensure t f the perfect accuacy of the knife edges and planes or provide a method of making the vibrations in all cases from the same part of the knife edge and from the same part of the plane or in other words that the knife edge and plane shall in all cases touch each eaother at the same points of contact This I conceive would not be difficult and it must be attended to in all future experiments We must deal with the experiments already made in the best manner we can Correctionfor the Arc of Vibration In a recent volume of the Transactions of this Societyt Captain SABINE has stated that the usual formula for the reduction of the vibrations of a pendu lum to indefineitely small arcs is eroneous inasmuch as it does not agree with the result of his observations which require that the hitherto assumed corrections should in the case of the convertible pendulum tried by him when the heaviest end is below the axis of suspension be multiplied by 1P12 and when it is above the axis of suspension be multiplied by 140 As this view of the subject was somewhat at variance with what I had imagined to be the case in my own experiments I determined on making a few trials in order to ascertain more minutely the difference which arises from the use of large and small arcs and for this purpose I took the brass bar convertible pendulum No 25 above enumerated Two series were made in the vacuum apparatus and at about one inch pressure of the atmosphere on the knife edge A and two on the knife edge B and each of these series was divided into three por tions  in the first of which the arc was taken from about 1i00 to about 0060 in the second from 0060 to about 038 and in the last from 0038 to about 0020 and 010 The first series on the knife edge A showed that the usual correction ought to be increased about Lth which accords very nearly with  Since this was written I have caused my agate planes to be slightly rounded so that a very fine thread of light can be seen under the knife edge on each side of the small line where it touches the curve By this method I have got rid of the discordancy in the pendulum No 2526 which is the only one I have yet tried in this way t Philosophical Transactions for 1831 page 461 c 468A PENDULUM FOR THE REDUCTION TO A VACUUM Captain SABINES determination but the second series on the same knife edge indicated that it ought to be diminished by nearly the same quantity I con sider therefore these two series as neutralizing each other and that the dif ferences observed come within the errors of observation With respect to the knife edge B both series showed that the correction should be increased Yth which is only one half the amount indicated by Captain SABINES experiments Further inquiries therefore are requisite to clear up this point not only as to the cause of the anomaly whether it arises from a sliding of the knife edges on the agae planes in which case it may differ in different pendulums and wholly vanish in M BESSELS mode of suspension but also as to the accuracy of the assumed data on which the generally received formula is founded When the aris very large the fomula will not lead as toe the l otrue result this has been already noticed by more than one author But whether the dif ference arises from a defect in the formula or fiom a sliding of the knife edges or from the variable effect of the air on the pendulum or from all three re mains still to be demonstrated Should any experiments for determining this point be commenced it would perhaps be better that the vacuum apparatus should not be used for the purpose but that a heavy sphere cylinder or lens suspended by a wire be swung in free air first on the knife edge and after wards over a steel cylinder due care being taken in the latter case that the wire befiat at that portion of it which passes over the cylinder A body of this kind will continue its vibrations for a sufficit lengenth of time for such experiments which was in act the reason for adopting the vacuurn apparatus for this purpose but which may present difficulties of another kind since it is difficult to prevent a leakage in the vacuum apparatus which has a material effect on the arc of vibration and moreover the proximity of the pendulum to the sides of the tube when swinging in large arcs mayinfluence the results But whatever be the cause of the discordancy it is evident that in the pre sent state of the subject we cannot strictly compare the results of experiments where the arcs eminployed have been widely different The initial arc ought in no case to exceed one degree in my own experiments I have generally com menced with an arc of about 09 or 0O8 but this I think is still too large and were I again to undertake any delicate experiments on the pendullum I should probably make the initial arc about half a degree only In the experiments MDCCCXXXII 3 p 469MR BAILY ON THE CORRECTION OF on the invariable pendulum made by the English the initial arc has been about 102 or 1 3 but in those made by MM FREYCINET and DUPERREY the initial arc has sometimes amounted to upwards of 3 degrees and Mr RuM KER in his experiments on the length of the seconds pendulum has in one instance commenced with an arc of 11 degrees On Captain SABINES recent determination of the length of the seconds pendulum at Greenwich In the volume of the Philosophical Transactions just quoted Captain SABINE has also given what he considers the true length of the seconds pendulum at Greenwich and which he makes equal to 39 13734 inches as deduced from his own observations there It is not my intention to make any remark on those observations which indeed appear to have been made with all due regard to accuracy but I trust I may be allowed whilst treating on a sub ject of this kind to express my dissent from the mode in which he has deduced the result in question In all cases of the convertible pendulum either the perfect synchronism of the two knife edges or which will answer the same purpose the difference in the results of the two knife edges ought to be well established by an equal weight of evidence for each knife edge This is indis pensable and unless it be accomplished the problem cannot be considered as strictly solved Each knife edge is independent of the other and each ought to have equal weight in the determination of the result It is true that the knife edge A or that position of the pendulum where the great weight is below the axis of suspension will in case of any difference always give a result nearer to the true value than the knife edge B but the proper cor rection to be applied to make them synchronous can only be determined by first giving to B an equal weight in the experiments Now perfect synchro nism I consider unattainable or at all events not worth the trouble it would cost to pursue it since the small difference which arises in these cases will always enable us to apply the proper correction from the known principles of the pendulum and which are a more sure guide on such occasions than any partial determination of the correction from actual experiment where in these minute inquiries the errors of observation are sure to baffle us in our object  Memoirs of the Astronomical Society vol iii page 289 470A PENDULUM FOR THE REDUCTION TO A VACUUM Captain SABINE however has preferred trusting to actual experiment for this minute correction and considering that the result shown by the knife edge A is the nearest to the truth he has rested on the establishment of that result without the requisite corroboration by an equal number of trials from the other knife edge which are in fact equally essential to the establishment of the accuracy of the whole Thus he has swung the pendulum 188 hours on the knife edge A and only 54 hours on the knife edge B But had this latter knife edge been employed during a longer period it might probably have tended to correct the anomaly that occurs on the face of the observations For it appears that when the slider was moved about 133 inch it caused an increase of 010 vibration in a day on the knife edge A whilst it caused a decrease of 112 vibration on the knife edge B But this is contrary to the known principles of the pendulum since the effect of a slider of this sort is to cause an alteration of the same kind in each knife edge differing only in degree the relative proportions of which may he ascertained by determining the di stance of the centre of gravity from each knife edge  In the state of the pen dulum in question when last used by Captain SABINE for the experiments here alluded to tthe tail pieces being wholly removed the distance of the centre of gravity from the knife edge A I found by actual measurement to be 26223 inches and from the knife edge B 1321 inches We have therefore 132 1985 as the factor by which any alteration in the results of knife edge A must be multiplied in order to show the corresponding alteration produced in the knife edge B which will be both positive or both negative And if this is not shown by the experiment we may reasonably suspect somne error in the obser vations Also we have 23  3L  1015 as the factor by which the dif ference in the number of vibrations between A and B must be multiplied to obtain the correction that should be applied to A in order to ascertain the number of vibrations that the pendulum would make if rendered perfectly synchronous and which is the quantity to be used in determining the length  The truth of this would have been shown and the absolute amount easily determined had Cap tain SABINE moved the slider through a larger space one or two inches for instance so as to have produced a decided and powerful effect on the number of vibrations sufficient to counterbalance the unavoidable errors of observation 3 2 471MR BAILY ON THE CORRECTION OF of the seconds pendulum In all such cases however it is presumed that the two knife edges are adjusted very nearly to synchronism If we apply these principles to Captain SABINES results we shall have the following values for the number of vibrations if the pendulum were rendered perfectly synchronous Slider A B AB If synchronous 1500 8606900 86070o26 126 86067 72 1566 X 6904 6961 0o57 6846 1633 6910 6914 0004 6906 There is a difference in these three values of 6 and 7 tenths of a vibration  and if one is to be preferred to the other it should be that which is the result of the greatest number of experiments which appears to be the second value here given But they all want the requisite corroboration of the knife edge B Method of observing and of reducing the Observations Before I conclude this paper it may be proper to say a few words on the method employed in making the experiments above alluded to and of the data used in the reduction of the observations in order that the circumstances under wlich each experiment has been made may fully appear and that each step of the computations may be verified at pleasure The clock used for observing the coincidences is an excellent one made by MOLYNEUX having a mercurial pendulum with a long tail piece furnished with two circular segments of gilt paper which reflect a very brilliant light the distance between these segments is variable at pleasure in order to suit the size of the different pendulums under experiment The rate of the clock is ascertained by a daily comparison with another clock made by HARDY regu lated to sidereal time the rate of which is determined by means of a 30inch transit instrument Both these clocks go very well and with respect to the experiments detailed in this paper which are merely conmparative do not afford the source of any appreciable error The clock used with the experiments and which I shall for the sake of distinction call the Pendulumclock has been in all the cases regulated to mean solar time except when used with the long cylindrical rod No 21 and with the long brass tube No 3538 where it was necessary to alter the length of the clock pendutlu in order to obtain con 472A PENDULUM FOR THE REDUCTION TO A VACUUM venient intervals for the coincidences The daily rate of the pendulum clock has always been kept very low for veryobvious reasons it has in no case exceeded 0880 in a day  Let t denote the total interval of time expressed in seconds employed in any given series as shown by the pendulum clock making 86400  r vibra tions in a mean solar day r being the daily rate of the clock which will be minius when losing and let n denote the number of coincidences always in cluding the first that have taken place during that interval Then will nI be the time of the mean inaterval of the coincidences expressed in seconds of the clock which I shall denote by m  and the number of vibrations N made by the pendulum of experiment in a mean solar day will be N 86400  r  86400 r  where the upper sign is to be taken when the pendulum of experiment goes faster than the clock and the lower sign when it goes slower All the pen dulums enumerated in this paper from No I to No 20 inclusive go faster than the clock and consequently the upper sign must be used in the compu tations All the bar pendulums from No 25 to No 34 and the pendulums No 40 and 41 go slower than the clock and therefore the lower sign must be adopted in those cases In all my reductions however I have made N equal to m 86400 only and have afterwards applied r 1   as a sepa rate correction for the rate of the clock For the long cylindrical rod No 21 a special computation was made and in the case of the cylindrical tube No 3538 the pendulum clock was adjusted so as to make 90000 vibrations in a day and the correction for the variation from that rate applied afterwards In noting the coincidences I adopt the plan suggested by Professors AIRY and WHEWELL and always observe the first and last disappearance and the first and last reappearance of the luminous disc the mean of the four is the  A sudden change may sometimes be noticed between some of the series of observations but this has occurred when the pendulum of experiment has been changed and when it was necessary to stop the clock in order to alter the luminous disc In some cases where the variation in the daily rate has been an appreciable quantity I have proportioned it in the different experiments during the day according to the intervals 473MR BAILY ON THE CORRECTION OF true time of the coincidence This is obviously the most correct mode of proceeding more so than by observing only one disappearance and one reappearance and much more so than by observing the disappearance only or the reappearance only It has also this convenience that it obviates the necessity of attending to the minute adjustment of the diaphragm and the eye is not in such case obliged to wander from one side of the pendulum to the other doubting on which side the disappearance or reappearance will take place I consider this part of the experiment as perfect and that no appre ciable error can occur when this mode of observing the coincidences is adoptedt In the detail of the experiments the two moments of disappear ance are written one over the other with a line between similar to a fractional quantity and the same with the reappearances the mean of the four is annexed in the subsequent collateral column Much has been said about the inutility of observing more than one of these phlenomena at which I must confess I have been somewhat surprisedt It is perhaps possible that if the same person always made the observations always under the same circum stances always with the same magnitude of the disc always with the same ex tent of the arc and that not very small and always with precisely the same quantity of light no great difference might be found in the results But as these are cases never likely to occur in practice and from the nature of the subject must be perpetually varying it is better to adopt a general and sure guide for determining the moment of coincidence and had I not pursued this plan I should in many instances have been led into considerable error The arc of vibration has always been observed by means of a diagonal scale affixed to the clock case and the divisions can be easily read off to the hun dredth part of a degree The scale is 7 inches distant from the pendulum  The experiments with the long cylindrical rod No 21 form an exception as in this case only one side of the rod could be seen in the vacuum tube t I have also adopted another suggestion of Professors AIRY and WIEWELL by removing the dia phragm from the inside of the telescope and placing it between the pendulum of experiment and the clock pendulum It is in fact attached to the clock case and is not only capable of being moved in every direction for the purpose of adjustment but also of being enlarged or contracted to suit the different pendulums employed  See Philosophical Transactions for 1826 page 4 c and the same volume Part II page 2 c containing Lieut FOSTERS experiments on the pendulum See also contra Captain SABINES Account of Experiments pages 217233 474A PENDULUM FOR THE REDUCTION TO A VACUUM and a proper correction has in each case been applied to the arc for the pro portion which this distance bears to the distance of the telescope from the pen dulum The values in the Table are the readings thus corrected All the pendulums have been reduced to a commorn standard of temperature which I have assumed equal to 62 As I had no means of determining the expansion of the different metals I have adopted such as I have considered most worthy of confidence Any error arising from this source can be but trifling as no considerable change of temperature has ever occurred during any two consecutive experiments In the suspension by the iron and silver wire I have taken into account the small piece of brass rod about 1 inch attached to the knife edge and also the radius of the sphere The following are the assumed rates of expansion for 1 of FAHRENHEITS thermometer viz Iron wire c  000006666 Iron bar  000006850 Copper bar  000009444 Brass bar  000010000 Silver wire c  000010600 The rate of expansion being denoted bye the formula for the correction of the number of vibrations on account of the temperature will be N X e t 62 where t denotes the mean height of the thermometer during the interval of the coincidences The mercurial pendulum No 39 and the wooden rod pendulums No 40 and 41 being compensation pendulums do not require any correction for temperature For determining the temperature I have always used two excellent standard thermometers made under Mr TROUGHTONS immediate inspection These are placed inside the vacuum apparatus one of them on a level with the axis of suspension and the other on a level with the centre of oscillation of the inclosed pendulum the lower one can be read through the glass window of  In a few of the experiments before I had contrived a method of suspending the lower thermo meter in the inside of the tube it was placed in a similar position as to the centre of oscillation on the outside The inner thermometer however has in all such cases been used in the reductions adding 05 to the mean height this being half the quantity by which the outer thermometer ex ceeded the other 475MR BAILY ON THE CORRECTION OF the tube When the air is exhausted from the tube I have in computing the corrections for temperature added 075 to the mean of the thermometers to compensate for the effect produced on the thermometers by the removal of the pressure of the atmosphere as indicated by Captain SABINE in the Philo sophical Transactions for 1829 page 214 this being the amount by which these thermometers were also affected by such removal In the detail of the experiments inserted in the Appendix to this paper the readings of the ther mometer are given without this correction In recording the barometer the correction for capillarity is always included but when the vacuum tube is exhausted a syphon gauge is employed to indicate the pressure of the atmo sphere and no correction is required The subjoined Appendix consists of two Tables in the first of which is given a detail of all the particulars copied from the Observationbooks requisite for deducing the corrections and in the second of which is given the amount of those corrections under their respective heads Table I shows the time of the first and the last coincidence the magnitude of the arc of vibration and the height of the barometer at those times respectively the highest and lowest readings of the two thermometers and the daily rate of the clock during the interval of each experiment the number and date of which are always annexed Table II contains 1 the corresponding number of each experi ment in the preceding Table for the sake of a convenient reference 20 the total interval of the experiment 3 the number of coincidences minus unity that have occurred 4 the mean interval expressed in seconds of the pendu lum clock 5 the amount of the corrections for the arc the thermometers and the daily rate of the clock and lastly the number of vibrations N or N according as the experiments were made in air or in vacuo in a mean solar day exclusive of the correction for the pressure of the atmosphere which is the quantity sought in the present inquiries In the latter part of this Table however viz from experiment 205 to 230 both inclusive the correction for the barometer is added and the last column then contains the true number of vibrations in a mean solar day including the correction for the pressure of the atmosphere for these experiments are of a totally different kind and aIe inserted to show the effect produced merely by

collars which are attached to be stated with reference to the pendulum No 3538 that to the tube and on which the pendulum swings are divided on their outer circumference into 16 equal parts thus making 8 several diameters numbered from 1 to 8 on which the vibrations of the pendulum may be varied I have also got 3 separate pairs of agate knife edges differing from each other in sharpness for the purpose of ascertaining whether the results are affected by such an alteration of this part of the apparatus But at present I have not made any experiments with this view

are reasonable the conventional assumption is that courts and commissions are not concerned with the creation of a policy They are supposed to give practical effect to one already enunciated by the Fourteenth Amendment and discovered there by the United States Supreme Court That policy is supposed to be expressed unequivocally in the formula that rates must be sufficient to cover reasonable operating expenses plus a proper allow ance for depreciation plus a fair return upon the value of the property The commission or court in each case is supposed to ascertain that value just as a tax commission or a jury might ascertain value the problem is supposed to call for research not policy Its ascertainment however in the words of the Supreme Court is not a matter of formulas but there must be a reasonable judgment having its basis in a proper con sideration of all relevant facts 2 Facts relevant to what to some other fact or to some policy to the measurement of a value whose meaning is taken for granted in the statement of the constitutional rule or to the choice of some standard to which the word value shall be attached The courts language gen erally implies the former But difficulties arise What is the meaning of value as the court uses it in this connection The court does not in practice protect a fair return upon the value in the ordinary sense of exchange valuethe sense in which the term is used in proceedings before tax commissions and juries The exchange value is a capitaliza tion of the net earnings anticipated under existing rates and those earn ings must of necessity constitute a fair return upon that value any reduction whatsoever in the net earnings would be held unconstitutional were a fair return on the exchange value to be effectively protected3 The value upon which a fair return is in fact permitted whatever the courts theory is not the exchange value Nor according to the courts dicta is it the original costthat might have been extravagant4 nor is it original cost even when not extravagantthe value on which rates The substance of a paper read at the Round Table on Public Utilities at the meeting of the Association of

be based may be found to be more than the original cost nor is it the reproduction cost new or reproduction cost less depreciation The Des Moines Gas Company was not allowed a return on the repro duction cost when that included the hypothetical cost of cutting through municipally laid paving to install the mains0 The socalled value upon which a return is required by the Fourteenth Amendment is none of the things enumerated above yet it is apparently something on which they all throw light But there is nothing unless it is exchange value whose size can be judged by a consideration of original cost reproduction cost and the other familiar items Some figure can be found it is true after considering all those items but what will it repre sent A figure can be derived from a consideration of a the number of soldiers who fought in France b the aggregate railroad mileage in the United States and c the tonnage of the Japanese navy but no such figure indicates the magnitude of any conceivable reality No more does the figure derived in the composite value casesunless it represents exchange value If it does and does so with accuracy it nullifies the power to reduce The reasonable judgment then which must be exercised is not a judgment as to the size of some value whose definition can be taken for granted How can a commission exercise judgment as to the measure ment of something when it does not know what it is that it is to measure The commission can exercise its judgment only as to the choice of a standard to which as a matter of policy the exchange value should be made to conform7 Even so the policy might conceivably be not the commissions own to be threshed out and formulated but a policy im posed on the commission from withouteither by statute or constitu tion or by a court of superior jurisdiction or by some universally recognized principle of economics or morals If the policy is imposed from without the commission need not consider its merits but only the means for effectuating it At first the Supreme Court found no mandatory policy at all in the Fourteenth Amendment8 Subsequently Mr Justice Brewer found the policy that property values must not be reduced by rate regulation9 The formula calling for a fair return on the value was originally adopted as a method of effectuating that policy This it succeeds in doing only if value means exchange value and if all reductions of net earnings are forbidden But they are not If Willcox v Consolidated Gas Co 1909 212 U S 19 52 29 Sup Ct 192 Minnesota Rate Cases supra footnote 2 p 454

follow any policy dictated to them from without it is not that found by Mr Justice Brewer Some can be found who contend that the policy of the Fourteenth Amendment is to protect all physical as distinct from intangible values from reduction In this view the courts occasional statements that franchises are property entitled to protectionl0 are to be accepted with reserve or at any rate in a sense which does not include the entire intangible element Assuming it to be possible to segregate the physical from the intangible part of the value of the property which is a highly doubtful assumptionl2 such a policy unlike that of Mr Justice Brewer is at any rate capable of application without defeating all utility regula tion Yet in any case where high earnings increase the value of physical property rather than of intangible the public would get no protection under this policy Such was the situation in MIunntt v Illinois where it was nevertheless held that the public was entitled to protectionl3 In that case the warehouses owed their monopoly entirely it seems to their strategic location The right to own lard in a particular strip was what carried with it the monopoly Whatever excessive earnings the warehouses could obtain therefore would add to the value of the land not to any intangible To reduce the earnings however high they might be would leave less than a fair return on the former value of the land and would thus diminish that value If the constitutional policy is to protect the value of physical property from confiscation then the effect of Mi unn v Illinois is to say that whenever the warehousemen shall be getting too much from their customers their rates may be reduced but in reducing them the conclusive presumption is that the existing rates are legitimate You may cut out the mans heart provided you draw no blood If commissions and courts in valuation cases are merely to execute a policy derived from without that policy is not then the one of pro tecting all property values or even all physical property values What is it Perhaps it is one derived by intuition from the institutions of the land Some rate bodies profess to feel an obligation to refuse to reduce the value of property affected with a public use below the level which similar property would have if used in a competitive business14 Under modern conditions it may be thought some industries because of 10 E g Willcox v Consolidated Gas Co supra footnote 5 p 44 11 See Hale Valuation and Rate Making The Conflicting Theories of the Wisconsin Railroad Commission 1918

special favors at the expense of the rest of the community The rest are on some sort of equality with one another brought about perhaps by competition The function of regulation is to put the favored ones on a level with the rest Commissions need not consider the wisdom or unwisdom of unearned increments or anything else Interest on capital and unearned increments may accrue to anyone under competi tion they must be allowed to accrue to the same degree but no more to the utility companies To fail to allow the utilities as much would not put them on an equality with the rest but would put them in an inferior position The above policy may perhaps be derived by intuition from some highly respectable sourcethe Fourteenth Amendment or the genius of our institutions or Herbert Spencer or the Fourteen Points But it is incapable of application The advantages which various businesses possess cannot be classified into those peculiar to utility companies on the one hand and those common to everyone else on the other There is scarcely a single advantage possessed by a business affected with a public use which cannot be matched in the case of some unregulated concern Neither intangible values nor virtual monopolies are confined to con cerns now subject to regulation On the other hand there is not a single incomeyielding property right inside or outside the utility field which can be enjoyed on equal terms by everyone To speak of equal rights of property is ridiculous Is the right of property of some unemployed tramp equal to the right of property of the owner of the La Salle Hotel If all have equal property rights why are the courts so occupied with dis putes over the title to property  Perhaps it is meant that all have equal rights to acquire property But what is the nature of a right to acquire property It is not an enforceable right One cannot get a decree of conveyance against any one else on the mere ground that the plaintiff has a right to acquire property Nor is it a permissive right a privilege in the Hohfeldian sense one who goes about acquiring property without regard to anyone else will soon find that he had a duty not to do so True one may acquire property by consent of a previous owner The government gen erally puts no restriction on this sort of acquisitionno restriction other than the very important veto power of the existing owner It restricts or not at his pleasure Again it may be asserted that anyone may acquire title to property by producing it But here again it is not law ful for most persons to handle the apparatus and materials essential for the production of any given kind of property without first getting con sent and that consent is frequently attainable only on condition of aban doning all claim to title in the product But as a practical matter it will be said the consent of previous owners is obtainable by all on equal termsby paying the market price 212RATE MAKING There are two flaws in this reasoning The payment of the market price is not an equally practical matter for all any more than an equally practical burden is imposed on all when the law in its majestic equality forbids rich and poor alike to sleep under the bridges or on the park benches to quote from Anatole France Moreover a greater inequal ity lies in the fact that there are some whom the law has enabled to acquire the title without paying the market price One man bought land very cheap around which a city has subsequently grown up an other inherited valuable property by will or by intestate succession Will it be contended that the generality who have to buy these objects at the market price or go without are on a practical level with the fortunate ones named above It can be argued even here that everyone had the same opportunity before the law to acquire property in these wayseven that everybody had the same right to be born the son of an intestate millionaire But such arguments can scarcely be called practical Perhaps sufficient has been said to demonstrate the fallacy in the assumption that all outside of utility companies have equal rights or equal practical opportunities of acquiring property It follows that a ratemaking body cannot successfully pursue a policy of bringing about an equality between utility companies and the owners of other property A thing cannot be made equal to a number of other things which are not equal one to another The truth which most rate bodies lack the courage to face is that in regulating the rates of utilities the law is trying the experiment in one limited field of turning its back on the principles which it fol lows elsewhere The experiment may perhaps be extended to other fields if successful We are experimenting with a legal curb on the power of property owners In applying that curb we have to work out prin ciples or working rulesin short a new body of law Those principles will necessarily differ from the ones upon which the law acts in other fieldsfor in other fields it acts on the assumption that whatever income a property owner can get without fraud by virtue of his ownership is legitimately his In the utility field standards of what it is proper for an owner to get out of his ownership have to be worked out de novo Because therefore the law permits various kinds of income outside the regulated field it does not follow that similar forms are to be approved within the regulated field15 The revision of property rights worked out within the utility field may very well serve as a model wherever applica ble for the revision of other property rights but what the law still allows elsewhere is no proper guide in formulating this new code 1 The utility company of course must be allowed whatever earnings may be necessary to attract capital in competition with less restricted bidders there for This does not however require that they be put on a level with the most favored owners in the unregulated field as the writer has attempted to show elsewhere The Physical Value Fallacy in Rate Cases supra footnote 3 pp 72526 213COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW We have already observed that there is no equal right to acquire property Let us analyze the legal nature of property somewhat more closely The right of ownership in a manufacturing plant is to use Hohfelds terms a privilege to operate the plant plus a privilege not to operate it plus a right to keep others from operating it plus a powert to acquire all the rights of ownership in the productsl0 The analysis is not meant to be exhaustive Having exercised his power to acquire ownership of the products the owner has a privilege to use them plus a much more significant right to keep others from using them plus a power to change the duty thereby implied in the others into a privilege coupled with rights7 This power is a power to release a pressure which the law of property exerts on the liberty of the others If the pressure is great the owner may be able to compel the others to pay him a big price for their release if the pressure is slight he can collect but a small income from his ownership In either case he is paid for releasing a pressure exerted by the governmentthe law The law has dele gated to him a discretionary power over the rights and duties of others8 Ownership is an indirect method whereby the government coerces some to yield an income to the owners When the law turns around and cur tails the incomes of property owners it is in substance curtailing the salaries of public officials or pensioners Frequently the owner can only exercise his power of coercion as a result of having rendered in the past some service in the production of wealth or of having abstained from consuming all the wealth which he might lawfully have consumed For this and other reasons of policy it would be as bad to abolish all incomes arising from ownership as it would be to abolish all salaries and pensions On the other hand it would be as absurd to justify any particular utility values on the ground that theirlegitimacy is generally recognized in other fields as it would be for a municipal administration to justify a salary of a sinecure on the ground that some other administration of some other city still pays that sort of salary Any value which is still to 1 A privilege or liberty or permissive right is that sort of right in popular parlance which implies no duty on the part of anyone else A right in the strict Hohfeldian sense or an enforceable right implies a duty on the part of others A power is the ability to alter the rights privileges etc of other people regardless of their consent For a detailed analysis of these and other terms which in popular legal usage are all loosely grouped under the name right see Wesley N Hohfeld Fundamenrtal Legal Conceptions 1919 The analysis also appeared in 1913 23 Yale Law Journ 16 and 1917 26 Yale Law Journ 710 1 It should be noted that when an owner is required by law to furnish service to all applicants who pay a prescribed price and when he is forbidden to serve any at less than that the owners immuntity from having the duty of outsiders changed into a privilege has been distroyed He still has a right to exclude others but also a liability to lose that right if they exercise their corresponding power to deprive him of it This they can exercise by tendering the price Only those possessed of sufficient money to pay that price have this power of course 18 For a more detailed exposition of this point of view see Hale Law Making by Unofficial Mintorities 1920 20 COILUMBIA LAW REv 451 214RATE MAKING AND PROPERTY be allowed to a utility company must be justified on some independent ground of policy Commissions and courts however are reluctant to cut loose from the familiar To avoid doing so they make flimsy distinctions When a gas company has laid its mains at low cost cutting through a dirt street there is no apparent reason as the courts see well enough for allowing it a value greater than would otherwise be allowed merely because if it were to lay its mains today it would have to undergo the more expensive process of cutting through pavement which was laid at the expense of other people If this reasoning is sound it leads to the conclusion that a company should not be given a value greater than would otherwise be allowed merely because if it were to buy its land today it would have to pay more than what it in fact did have to pay Yet to reach this conclusion would suggest a question as to why the familiar privately enjoyed increments should be permitted Fearing to make this suggestion Judge Miller of the New York Court of Appeals sought to distinguish the twochiefly on the ground that the paving did not in crease the cost to the company of producing gaso The argument plainly fails to distinguish the paving from the land increment which likewise does not increase the cost to the company of producing gas20 To take another example the Wisconsin Commission sought in one case to avoid the question of the legitimacy of private increment by asserting that land increment is not the result of unreasonable rates2 This also fails to distinguish from values which admittedly may be reduced In the Esch Cummins Act it is specifically recognized that an income may be exces sive though there are particular reasons for not reducing the rates Inasmuch as it is impossible    to establish uniform rates upon competitive traffic which will adequately sustain all the carriers which are engaged in such traffic and which are indispensable to the communi ties to which they render the service of transportation without enabling some of such carriers to receive a net railway operating income sub stantially and unreasonably in excess of a fair return upon the value of their railway property    it is hereby declared that any carrier which receives such an income so in excess of a fair return shall hold such part of the excess as hereinafter prescribed as trustee for and shall pay it to the United States 22 It may similarly be that a private landowner is not clarging excessive rates or prices yet that social policy requires him to pay part of what he collects by the aid of the government back to the government for wider distribution Into the merits of the unearned increment socalled it is not 19People ex rel

Jolurnal Printing Co v MAadisoil Gas  El Co supra footnote 14 p 579 22 Interstate Commerce Act  15a 5 Amendment of 1920 41 Stat 489 215COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW proposed to enter here It is probably true that a certain amount of increment is necessary but not nearly all that accrues today23 All that is contended here is that the merits of this and of all property rights ought to be thoroughly canvassed by courts and commissions in rate cases Their failure to do so is an evasion of the real issues To do so would be to work out a body of law for the revision of property rights where they need revision and for their preservation where they need preserving then when the power of taxation is added to that of price reduction as a method of revising property rights this body of law might be gradually extended The result might be radical if so it would be because on a piecemeal and candid review many of the inci dents of property would prove themselves to be without justification If property is not revised methodically by its friends it is likely to be revised unmethodically by its enemies with disastrous results Courts may be too busy and may possess too little flexibility of mind to attempt the task There is much to be said for Mr Hendersons proposal24 that the courts return to the dictum in the Munn case and leave the mat ter to legislatures and commissions within much wider limits than at present The commissions on the other hand have as a rule been as evasive as the courts of the real issue of policy This might perhaps be avoided however if the courts particularly the United States Su preme Court would repudiate the metaphysics which has hitherto misled the commissions and would redefine the issues Whether the ultimate determination of this important policy ques tion ought to rest in the hands of small bodies of men not chosen pri marily because of their views of policy is another question It raises the whole problem of representative government and involves interna tional complications at times It might be better for some official or un official body to draft a detailed report on the revision of the entire institu tion ofproperty Meantime the fact remains that the immediate if not the ultimate determination of this policy is in the hands of courts and com missions Nothing is to be gained by their failing to make a candid re examination of the functions of ownership The man at the steering wheel regardless of his personal qualifications has to use his own best judgment where to steer pending definite instructions from the boss He who expects the present generation of judges and commissioners however to deal constructively with the problems presented to them in these cases instead of continuing to evade them is indeed an optimist

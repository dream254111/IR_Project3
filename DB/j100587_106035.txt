the Royal Academy at Portsmouth to Charles Morton M D Sec R S inclosing some Account of a Solar Eclipse observed at Georges Island by Captain Wallis and several Astronomical Observations made at Portsmouth To Cha Morton Sec R S c S I R I Beg the favour of you to lay before the Royal Society an extract of a letter to me from Captain Wallis containing an ob servation of a solar eclipse which happened during his stay at Georges Island from which I have cal culated the difference of meridians between that place and Greenwich Read Feb 13 1771 To this I have subjoined some astronomical ob servations which have been made here by Mr Brad ley and myself both before and since the building of the Observatory belonging to the Academy which if they should prove acceptable to the Royal Society will induce us to take every opportunity of V O L LXII F con34 continuing to transmit them as we shall always esteem it a peculiar happiness to be able to contri bute any thing that may be deemed worthy of their notice I am S I R Your most obedient humble servant G Witchell Royal Academy Portsmouth August 9 1771 Extract of a Letter from Captain Wallis June 20th 1771   Saturday July 25th 1767 being at  anchor in his Majestys ship Dolphin in harbour  went on shore on a low point of land not above  four feet higher than the sea and observed an  eclipse of the Sun as below Latitude by the  mean of many observations 17 30 South lon  gitude by various observations of the distance of  the Sun from the Moon between 149 30 and  149 50 West from London  By35 h   h    By the masters watch at 7

eclipse by the masters watch at 8 1 48 A M 8 1 0  By my watch at 7 59 0  Duration 1 9 10  We were not certain of the instant of the beginning of the eclipse from a little negligence but  very certain of the end R E M A R K As the Suns altitudes are given without any correction I suppose they were taken by bring ing down the image of the Sun till it appeared bisected by the visible horizon I have therefore recomputed the time by allowing for the dip and refraction which together amount to 8 This correction makes the apparent time of the beginning 6h 51 12 and the end 8h 0 37 hence the du ration of the eclipse was 1h 9 25 but by a care ful computation from Mayers new Tables the du ration should have been 1h 13 2012 which is al most about 4 longer than the observation affords but as it is remarked that the beginning was not exactly taken and the Moon entering very obliquely on the Sun the defect in 4 would be but little It seems most reasonable to attribute the whole of the error to the beginning of the eclipse I have there fore deduced the longitude from the end and F 2 make36 make it to be 9h 55 55 West from Greenwich or 148 5834 which is 4114 less than the mean result of the lunar observations which considering all circumstances is not in my opinion a very great difference for the first observations that were ever made upon this island Astronomical Observations made at the Royal Aca demy Portsmouth 1769 May 9th at 8h 13 9 apparent time Mr Bradley observed the immersion of  IIorum by the Moon uncertain to a few minutes on account of the strong twilight The emersion was not taken The transit of Venus and solar eclipse next morn ing were both observed here but having then no better instrument for determining the going of the clock than an indifferent Hadleys sextant I do not think the observations worthy of being laid before the Society and for the same reason omit the observations of the comet 1770 April 7th at 11h 23 33 apparent time by Mr Bradleys observation the Moon occulted  is My time was within 2 or 3 the same but we did not observe the emersion This oc cultation was observed both at Greenwich by Mr Maskelyne and at Oxford by Professor Hornsby by comparing which it appears that this place is West of Greenwich 4 2412 of time and that Oxford is West of Greenwich 4 5812 1 177037 1770 April 28 at 9h 48 13 apparent time Mr Bradley and I both at the same instant observed the immersion of  i by the Moon The emer sion was not taken By comparing this with Mr Maskelynes observation our longitude comes out 4 2334 West from Greenwich 1770 July 21st is marked for an eclipse of Jupiters fourth satellite in the Nautical Almanac but the Connoissance des Temps notes it as a conjunction only and remarks that the satellite would rase the shadow without disappearing which we found to be true for we both saw the satellite the whole time which is marked for its dura tion though at the middle it appeared extremely faint These observations were made before our Obser vatory was finished but that being completed in the month of September and furnished with an excel lent though small mural quadrant and transit in strument both made by that eminent artist Mr John Bird we began to observe meridian transits from which I shall select those that were made for deter mining the solstices and the oppositions of the three superiour planets which I shall transcribe just as they were taken excepting only making the ne cessary allowance for the error of the line of col limation Observations38 Observations for determining the Solstices App zen

observations were chiefly taken by Mr Bradley Those which follow are what I took about the time of the late oppositions of the superior planets in which as well as the preceding observations the apparent zenith distances are those which were taken by the 96th arc on which we chiefly depend though the difference between the two arcs seldom arises to more than three or four seconds For39 For

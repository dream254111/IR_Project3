HAPPENED DURING HIS STAY AT GEORGES ISLAND FROM WHICH I HAVE CAL CULATED THE DIFFERENCE OF MERIDIANS BETWEEN THAT PLACE AND GREENWICH READ FEB 13 1771 TO THIS I HAVE SUBJOINED SOME ASTRONOMICAL OB SERVATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE HERE BY MR BRAD LEY AND MYSELF BOTH BEFORE AND SINCE THE BUILDING OF THE OBSERVATORY BELONGING TO THE ACADEMY WHICH IF THEY SHOULD PROVE ACCEPTABLE TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY WILL INDUCE US TO TAKE EVERY OPPORTUNITY OF V O L LXII F CON34 CONTINUING TO TRANSMIT THEM AS WE SHALL ALWAYS ESTEEM IT A PECULIAR HAPPINESS TO BE ABLE TO CONTRI BUTE ANY THING THAT MAY BE DEEMED

BEING AT  ANCHOR IN HIS MAJESTYS SHIP DOLPHIN IN HARBOUR  WENT ON SHORE ON A LOW POINT OF LAND NOT ABOVE  FOUR FEET HIGHER THAN THE SEA AND OBSERVED AN  ECLIPSE OF THE SUN AS BELOW LATITUDE BY THE

ECLIPSE BY THE MASTERS WATCH AT 8 1 48 A M 8 1 0  BY MY WATCH AT 7 59 0  DURATION 1 9 10  WE WERE NOT CERTAIN OF THE INSTANT OF THE BEGINNING OF THE ECLIPSE FROM A LITTLE NEGLIGENCE BUT  VERY CERTAIN OF THE END R E M A R K AS THE SUNS ALTITUDES ARE GIVEN WITHOUT ANY CORRECTION I SUPPOSE THEY WERE TAKEN BY BRING ING DOWN THE IMAGE OF THE SUN TILL IT APPEARED BISECTED BY THE VISIBLE HORIZON I HAVE THEREFORE RECOMPUTED THE TIME BY ALLOWING FOR THE DIP AND REFRACTION WHICH TOGETHER AMOUNT TO 8 THIS CORRECTION MAKES THE APPARENT TIME OF THE BEGINNING 6H 51 12 AND THE END 8H 0 37 HENCE THE DU RATION OF THE ECLIPSE WAS 1H 9 25 BUT BY A CARE FUL COMPUTATION FROM MAYERS NEW TABLES THE DU RATION SHOULD HAVE BEEN 1H 13 2012 WHICH IS AL MOST ABOUT 4 LONGER THAN THE OBSERVATION AFFORDS BUT AS IT IS REMARKED THAT THE BEGINNING WAS NOT EXACTLY TAKEN AND THE MOON ENTERING VERY OBLIQUELY ON THE SUN THE DEFECT IN 4 WOULD BE BUT LITTLE IT SEEMS MOST REASONABLE TO ATTRIBUTE THE WHOLE OF THE ERROR TO THE BEGINNING OF THE ECLIPSE I HAVE THERE FORE DEDUCED THE LONGITUDE FROM THE END AND F 2 MAKE36 MAKE IT TO BE 9H 55 55 WEST FROM GREENWICH OR 148 5834 WHICH IS 4114 LESS THAN THE MEAN RESULT OF THE LUNAR OBSERVATIONS WHICH CONSIDERING ALL CIRCUMSTANCES IS NOT IN MY OPINION A VERY GREAT DIFFERENCE FOR THE FIRST OBSERVATIONS THAT WERE EVER MADE UPON THIS ISLAND ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS MADE AT THE ROYAL ACA DEMY PORTSMOUTH 1769 MAY 9TH AT 8H 13 9 APPARENT TIME MR BRADLEY OBSERVED THE IMMERSION OF  IIORUM BY THE MOON UNCERTAIN TO A FEW MINUTES ON ACCOUNT OF THE STRONG TWILIGHT THE EMERSION WAS NOT TAKEN THE TRANSIT OF VENUS AND SOLAR ECLIPSE NEXT MORN ING WERE BOTH OBSERVED HERE BUT HAVING THEN NO BETTER INSTRUMENT FOR DETERMINING THE GOING OF THE CLOCK THAN AN INDIFFERENT HADLEYS SEXTANT I DO NOT THINK THE OBSERVATIONS WORTHY OF BEING LAID BEFORE THE SOCIETY AND FOR THE SAME REASON OMIT THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE COMET 1770 APRIL 7TH AT 11H 23 33 APPARENT TIME BY MR BRADLEYS OBSERVATION THE MOON OCCULTED  IS MY TIME WAS WITHIN 2 OR 3 THE SAME BUT WE DID NOT OBSERVE THE EMERSION THIS OC CULTATION WAS OBSERVED BOTH AT GREENWICH BY MR MASKELYNE AND AT OXFORD BY PROFESSOR HORNSBY BY COMPARING WHICH IT APPEARS THAT THIS PLACE IS WEST OF GREENWICH 4 2412 OF TIME AND THAT OXFORD IS WEST OF GREENWICH 4 5812 1 177037 1770 APRIL 28 AT 9H 48 13 APPARENT TIME MR BRADLEY AND I

JULY 21ST IS MARKED FOR AN ECLIPSE OF JUPITERS FOURTH SATELLITE IN THE NAUTICAL ALMANAC BUT THE CONNOISSANCE DES TEMPS NOTES IT AS A CONJUNCTION ONLY AND REMARKS THAT THE SATELLITE WOULD RASE THE SHADOW WITHOUT DISAPPEARING WHICH WE FOUND TO BE TRUE FOR WE BOTH SAW THE SATELLITE THE WHOLE TIME WHICH IS MARKED FOR ITS DURA TION THOUGH AT THE MIDDLE IT APPEARED EXTREMELY FAINT THESE OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE BEFORE OUR OBSER VATORY WAS FINISHED BUT THAT BEING COMPLETED IN THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER AND FURNISHED WITH AN EXCEL LENT THOUGH SMALL MURAL QUADRANT AND TRANSIT IN STRUMENT BOTH MADE BY THAT

j100403,Virginia Law Review,1063584,The Proposed Treaty between the United States and the Republic of Colombia,i243794,PROPOSED TREATY BETWEEN U S AND COLOMBIA 247 THE PROPOSED TREATY BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA ON JUNE 14th 1914 the President of the United States transmitted to the Senate for ratification a treaty be tween the United States of America and the Republic of Co lombia which had been signed by their respective plenipoten tiaries on April 6th 1914 at Bogota the capital of Colombia This treaty is generally known and designated as the Thom sonUrrutia Treaty to distinguish it from other treaties nego tiated between the United States and Colombia since the Pan ama Incident of November 3rd 1903 all of which however have heretofore failed of ratification by one or the other of the contracting parties Mr Thaddeus A Thomson was the en voy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the United States to the government of Colombia and Francisco Jose Ur rutia was minister of foreign affairs of Colombia PREAMBLE The purpose of this treaty is set forth in the preamble as follows The United States of America and the Republic of Co lombia being desirous to remove all the misunderstand ings growing out of the political events in Panama in November 1903 to restore the cordial friendship that formerly characterized the relations between the two coun tries and also to define and regulate their rights and in terests in respect of the interoceanic canal which the gov ernment of the United States is constructing across the Isthmus of Panama have resolved for this purpose to con clude a Treaty and have accordingly appointed as their Plenipotentiaries  ARTICLE I It is not the purpose of this short article to discuss the mis understandings growing out of the political events in PanamaVIRGINIA LAW REVIEW in 1903 but it is to be limited to that part of this proposed treaty defining and regulating the rights and interests in re spect of the interoceanic canal of the Republic of Colombia and the United States Article I of this treaty with which we have no concern in this discussion is in the nature of a diplo matic disposition of distressing differences albeit that these differences arose out of events which swept away the obstruc tions of a haggling cupidity to one of the greatest achieve ments of mankind This article is as follows The Government of the United States of America wish ing to put at rest all controversies and differences with the Republic of Colombia arisng out of the events from which the present situation in Panama resulted expresses in its own name and in the name of the people of the United States sincere regret that anything should have occurred to interrupt or to mar the relations cf cordial friendship that had so long subsisted between the two na tions The Government of the Republic of Colombia in its own name and in the name of the Colombian people accepts this declaration in the full assurance that every obstacle to the restoration of complete harmony between the two countries will thus disappear ARTICLE II Article II contains an enumeration of the rights and interests of Colombia in the Panama Canal divided into five paragraphs as follows The Republic of Colombia shall enjoy the following rights in respect to the interoceanic Canal and the Panama Rail way 1 The Republic of Colombia shall be at liberty at all times to transport through the interoceanic Canal its troops materials of war and ships of war even in case of war between Colombia and another country without paying any charges to the United States 2 The products of the soil and industry of Colombia pass ing through the Canal as well as the Colombian mails shall be exempt from any charge or duty other than those to 248PROPOSED TREATY BETIVEEN U S AND COLOMBIA 249 which the products and mails of the United States may be subject The products of the soil and industry of Co lombia such as cattle salt and provisions shall be ad mitted to entry in the Canal Zone and likewise in the is lands and mainland occupied or which may be occupied by the United States as auxiliary andt accessory thereto with out paying other duties or charges than those payable by similar products of the United States 3 Colombian citizens crossing the Canal Zone shall upon production of proper proof of their nationality be exempt from every toll tax or duty to which citizens of the United States are not subject 4 During the construction of the interoceanic Canal and afterwards whenever traffic by the Canal is interrupted or whenever it shall be necessary for any other reason to use the railway the troops materials of war products aind mails of the Republic of Colombia as above mentioned shall even in case of war between Colombia and another country be transported on the Railway between Ancon and Cristobal or on any other Railway substituted there for paying only the same charges and duties as are im posed upon the troops materials of war products and mails of the United States The officers agents and em ployees of the Government of Colombia shall upon pro duction of proper proof of their official character or their employment also be entitled to passage on the said Rail way on the same terms as officers agents and employees of the Government of the United States The provisions of this paragraph shall not however apply in case of war between Colombia and Panama 5 Coal petroleum and seasalt being the products of Co lombia passing from the Atlantic coast of Colombia to any Colombian port on the Pacific coast and vice versa shall be transported over the aforesaid Railway free of any charge except the actual cost of handling and transporta tion which shall not in any case exceed onehalf the ordi nary freight charges levied upon similar products of the United States passing over the Railway and in transit from one port to another of the United States A more detailed study of each of these paragraphs or divi sions of Article II seems necessaryVIRGINIA LAW REVIEIV THE FIRST PARAGRAPH This paragraph extends to the Republic of Colombia the privilege at all times of transporting through the Panama Ca nal its troops materials of war and ships of war even in case of war between Colombia and another country without pay ing any charges to the United States therefor In order to un derstand this paragraph as well as those which follow it a short incursion into the interesting historical background of in teroceanic communication across the Isthmus of Panama will prove helpful For more than three hundred years a tortuous trail across the Isthmus of Panama paved with rounded stones was the royal road for the transportation of the vast wealth of gold wrung by the Spanish Conquistadores from the Incas of Peru But with the settlement in 1846 of the Oregon boundary dis pute and the acquisition by the United States in 1848 from Mexico of that great undeveloped territory bordering on the Pacific the demand and necessity for more expeditious com munication between the two seaboards than then afforded by a treke across the great American Indianinfested desert or a perilous trip of twelve thousand miles around Cape Horn or even a four days muleback ride over a rough and ofttimes im passable trail through impenetrable jungles and a land of pes tilential fevers became more and more insistent In Decem ber 1848 William H Aspinwall John L Stevens and Henry Chauncey of New York secured a concession from the Re public of New Granada to construct a railroad across the Isth mus of Panama In 1849 the legislature of the state of New York passed an act incorporating the Panama Railroad Com pany and in June 1850 a formal contract was entered into be tween the Republic of New Granada and the Panama Railroad Company for the construction of the railroad within the space of six years The right of the company was an exclusive one and this contract defined in great detail the relative rights and duties of the parties thereto Article 33 of this contract is as follows 250PROPOSED TREATY BETWEEN U S AND COLOMBIA 251 No taxes or contributions national provincial munuicipal nor of any other kind shall be imposed upon the railroad or upon its warehouses furniture machines or other works property and effects belonging to it and which in the judgment of the Executive Power are necessary for the service of the said railroad or its dependencies and in compensation it is expressly stipulated that in every case and notwithstanding any provisions of this contract to the contrary the troops warlike stores arms clothing and other effects of the Government of the Republic and persons coming to it as new settlers on account of the State shall be transported gratuitously over the railroad at the charge and cost of the Company and without the Government or such troops or colonists having to pay any thing for freight cr any other cause It is from the above article of the Contract of 1850 that we must trace the origin of the first paragraph of Article II of the proposed treaty However the Republic of Granada subse quently became the United States of Colombia and the con tract of 1850 was modified in 1867 1876 1880 and 1891 In the contract of 1867 the transportation of troops is provided for in Article 19 much as it had been in Article 33 of the con tract of 1850 Article 19 is as follows In compensation for these exemptions the Company binds itself to transport gratuitously and without the Govern ment having to pay anything either for freight or for any other cause the troops chiefs and officers and their equip age ammunition armament clothing and all similar ef fects that may belong to are or may be destined for the Republic or of the State of Panama as also their officials in service or in commission and those individuals who with their families and baggage may come to the country in the character of emigrants and of new settlers with the permanent character of such for account of the Govern ment up to the number of 2000 annually The Executive Power shall dictate the provisions as it may deem proper in such cases in order to prevent those passengers whose entry into Cclombian territory may be purely accidental from availing themselves of this concession Article 17 of this Contract of 1867 permitted the Railroad Company to bring into the Isthmus without the payment ofVIRGINIA LAW REVIEW any duty therefor all things intended for the use of the rail road and the provisioning of the workmen employed on it Article 18 exempted from national state and municipal taxa tion of every kind the property of the Railroad Company These are the exemptions referred to in Article 19 quoted above relative to the free transportation of troops etc of Co lombia This article remained in this form throughout the sub sequent modifications of the contract and was in force and ef fect when the United States Government acquired all of the stock of the Panama Railroad Company after 1903 The concession secured by Lucien Napoleon Bonaparte Wyse in 1878 from the Colombian Government for a ship canal across the Isthmus under which the Universal Inter oceanic Canal Company or the first French Canal Company operated contaihed a clause almost identical to that in the con tracts of the Panama Railroad Company relative to troop transportation It was as follows Article VI The United States of Colombia reserve to themselves the right to pass their vessels troops ammu nition of war at all times and witlout paying any dues whatever The passage of the cana is strictly closed to war vessels of nations at war and which may not have acquired by public treaty with the Colombian Govern ment the right to pass by the Canal at all times In passing it may be observed that this French Canal Com pany concession contemplated a canal in any part of the Isth mus and contained a clause requiring an amicable arrange ment with or indemnity to the Panama Railroad Company if the location of the canal should be west of Cape Tiburon or Garachine Point because within this territory of the Republic the Railroad Company had an exclusive concession Not only was it required in all the various contracts between the Panama Railroad Company and in the French Canal Coni pany concession by the sovereignty of the soil through which the railroad or canal passed that the troops munitions etc of such sovereignty should pass through such canal and be transported over such railroad free of charge but when the treaty between the United States and the Republic of Pananma 252PROPOSED TREATY BETWEEN U S AND COLOMBIA 253 was entered into in November 1903 this treaty contained a similar requirement in favor of the new sovereign of this strip of land Article XIX of the treaty is as follows The Government of the Republic of Panama shall have the right to transport over the canal its vessels and its troops and munitions of war in such vessels at all times without paying charges of any kind The exemption is to be extended to the auxiliay railway for the transpor tation of persons in the service of the Republic of Pan ama or of the police force charged with the preservation of public order outside of said Zone as well as to their baggage munitions of war and supplies It is also to be noted that this article of the Panama treaty applies such free transportation not only to the transisthmian railroad but to the canal as well and adds to the list of things to receive such free transportation the vessels of the Govern ment of the Republic of Panama This requirement is similar to that imposed upon the French Canal Company in its conces sion This right to free transportation up to the present time has inhered in the government which has had sovereignty over the Isthmus of Panama that is New Granada and Colombia and after 1903 the Republic of Panama By the ThoinsonUrrutia Treaty it is proposed to extend this privilege to Cololmbia who no longer has any sovereign rights in and to the Isthmus of Panama unless this proposed treaty be interpreted as a recog nition of present sovereign rights in Colombia to the Canal Zone in derogation and in diminution of the rights recognized now by all the world as pertaining to Panama and the United States THE SECOOND PARAGRAPIH The setond paragraph of Article II of the proposed Thom sonUrrutia Treaty exempts Colombian mails and the products of the soil and industry of Colombia passing through the Canal from any charge or duty other than those to which the products and mail of the United States may be subject In so far as the mails are concerned it is probable that this paragraph has its origin in Article XXX of the contract ofVIRGINIA LAW REVIEW 1850 between the Panama Railroad Company and New Gran ada whereby the former undertook    to transport by the railroad free of charge all the mails of New Granada but this was then agreed to by the Railroad Company in com pensation for the privilege extended to it by New Granada of contracting with and charging foreign governments for trans porting their mails across the Isthmus Carrying the mails free was more than compensated for by being allowed to di rectly charge foreign governments for carrying their mails Colombia does not and cannot now make any such concession to the United States That part of this paragraph relating to products of the soil and industry of Colombia harks back to the Railroad Com panys contract of 1867 which contained the following article Colombian productions shall be fransported by the railroad during the first twenty years of this contract paying only onehalf of the rates of freight or transportation pre viously fixed by the company for foreign products of the same class but this term being concluded they shall pay a charge or freight not exceeding twothirds of that pre viously fixed in the tariff of the Companytariff rates which the Company cannot increase in the future in re gard to Colombian productions and to Article 1 of the amendment to this contract made in 1891 which is as follows From and after July 1st 1892 Colombian products pass ing over the Panama Railroad shall pay only half of the rate of freight established by the company for foreign products of the same class These references to the Panama Railroad contract give us an insight into the origin of the verbiage used in the Thomson Urrutia Treaty but the practical effect to be given this second paragraph under conditions existing today is most difficult to determine The paragraph refers first to charges or duty for Colombian products and mails passing through the Canal and second to the charges or duty upon the entry of such products into the Canal Zone and auxiliary lands and waters There is no charge or duty for articles passing through the Canal now 254PROPOSED TREATY BETWEEN U S AND COLOMBIA 255 whatever their origin The only charge made is a tonnage charge against the vessel passing through the Canal whetlier it carry mails Colombian products or products of tlhe United States or any other country What are the charges or duty paid by the United States upon its products and mails What does this paragraph mean Its meaning would seem to be cloulded in ambiguity and this indeed is a most potent reason why this treaty in its present form should not be ratified As to charges or duty for entry into the Canal Zone there is no charge or duty of any kind for anything that is to be used in the construction operation maintenance sanitation or protec tion of the Canal and its auxiliary works For such articles as are not for canal purposes duties are imposed and paid to the Republic of Panama as well upon American products as upon those of any other nationality This part of the proposed treaty is equally ambiguous THE THIRD PARAGRAPH The third clause of Article II exempts Colombian citizens crossing the Canal Zone from any toll tax or duty to which citizens of the United States are not subject There are no tolls taxes or duties imposed upon any one crossing the Canal Zone and there is no apparent reason why such a clause should be inserted in the treaty THE FOURTH PARAGRAPH This clause requires that whenever traffic by the Canal is in terrupted or whenever it may be necessary for any other rea son to use the railway then the troops materials of war pro ducts and mails of Colombia shall be transported on the rail way for the same charges and duties imposed upon like things for the United States What does this mean Tle Paanam Railroad Company is a corporation but every known share of stock is owned by the United States The United States pays its railroad the Panama Railroad Company for hauling their troops materials of war and mails Of course it is only a mat ter of taking money out of one pocket and putting it into an other Special agreements have existed and presumably still 3VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW exist whereby the Panama Railroad Company charges the United States or the government of the Panama Canal a lump sum monthly or annually upon the basis of a maximum or min imum tonnage It was not practicable or desirable to pay freight upon each shipment of freight and yard of dirt incident to the enormous volume of canal business Under this proposed treaty is Colombia to pay anything for transportation over the rail road Lecause in effect since the United States owns the rail road it pays nothing for its transportation or is Colombia to have the same rate that the United States pays for transporting its own productj to be used in and about its own service Un ler Article XIX of the Treaty with Panama sutpra this serv ice is rendered Panama free in return for value received by way of concessions from Panama to the United StaLes The officers agents and employees of Colombia are to be transported on the railroad upon the samne terms as officers agents and employees of the Government of the United States Many of the officers agents and employees of the United States are given free transportation on the railroad in the form of annual passes and monthly trip passes By employees these passes have been considered as a part of their compensation from the government They enable the employees to attend and take part in amusements and celebrations intended to make employ ees far away from their homes contented and happy How do these reasons apply to officers agents and employees of Colom bia and why should these privileges be extended to tlhem THE FIFTH PARAGRAPH This article requires that all coal petroleum and sea salt pro duced in Colombia and being transported from one coast to the other shall be transported over the railway free of any charge except the actual cost of handling and transportation provided that such charge shall not in any event exceed onehalf of what is charged for transporting the same products of the United States from one coast of the United States to the other This is a most aiiornalousiy conceived paragraph The United States Government at an enormous cost reconstructed the entire line of the Panama Railroad and yet it now agrees to transport a 256PROPOSED TREATY BETWEEN U S AND COLOMBIA 257 ton of coal passing from Barranquilla on the Atlantic seaboard to Buenaventura on the Pacific across the Panama Railroad for just onehalf of what it can charge for a ton of coal en route from Norfolk to San Francisco It is inconceivable that the United States through the Panama Railroad has ever charged or can ever charge for transporting coal petroleum and salt from the United States across the railway twice as much as the actual cost of the transportation therefore under this proposed treaty Colombian coal petroleum and salt must be transported across the Panama Railroad at a loss to the United States Vho can today safely estimate what this may mean fifty years from now when the vast natural resources of Colombia are opened up and developed This is a mortgage on the future which not only can never be paid off or discharged but which in all probability will grow larger and larger with the passing years Curiously enough one of the amendments to the conces sionary contract of the Panama Railroad Company agreed to in 1891 with Colombia related to transportation of salt over the railroad Salt from the Colombian Salt Pits on the Atlantic Coast intendcd for the National ports of the Pacific shall be transported by the same railroad company at the follow ing rates A quantity of not exceeding six million of kilograms each year and which in no case shall exceed one thousand tons per month at the rate of 200 gold per ton without any deduction Shipments of the salt referred to that may ex ceed the quantity above stated shall pay the rate that is es tablished for the other Colombian products in the previous Article The previous article establishes a onehalf rate for Colombian products This concession in actual practice never placed any heavy burden on the Panama Railroad Company but the pro posed treaty adds coal and petroleum to the products to be trans ported at half rate which were not mentioned in the Panama Railroad concession Why Why this indefinite and indeter minate mortgage upon the future of the Panama RailroadVIRGINIA LAW REVIEW GENERAI CONSIDERATIONS AS TO ARTICLE 1I In the early days of railroad constructionl in the United States it was quite the usual and customary thing to grant free passes to property owners over whose lands the ntew railroad rightof way passed This custom may have served its purpose fifty years ago but today it has no place in the business world Not so many years ago passes by the thousands were issued by the railroads to State and County officials but the aroused public conscience of recent years has condemned this practice There would seem to be no more reason why the government of the United States in the operation of great public service facilities should disregard the sound business practice of the industrial world and adopt a justly discarded system There is no an swer to these objections upon the theory that treatymaking in volves questions of diplomacy rather than business Diplomacy has fallen into disrepute for the very reason that it has not been modernized The purpose of a treaty is to eliminate difficulties and remove all causes of friction between the contracting parties and not to create such difficulties The granting of rights in ambigu ous terms or leaving for future determination the nature and extent of the rights granted is not eliminating difficulties is not removing differences but above all else is leading the way to iievitable misunderstandings This treaty was not prepared by any one on behalf of the United States who has been intimately associated with the practical administration of such grants in similar contracts or treaties Indeed from the quotations supra it is to be clearly seen that the language of contracts and treat ies has been copiel apparently without a knowledge of the ap plicability of such language to present conditions Those who have been connected with the Panama Railroad Company know too well the thousands of dollars each year in free transporta tion which has been given formerly to the Government of Colombia and latterly to the Republic of Panama If this free transportation has in the past amounted to thousands of dollars annually when the country was sparsely settled and largely un developed what is the amount of the mortgage which we are 258PROPOSED TREATY BETWEEN U S AND COLOMBIA 259 placing on the Panama Canal to be borne by future generations for the benefit of the Government of Colombia however pop ulous and well developed may become its territory In consid ering this mortgage on the future it might also be borne in mind that the benefits of free transportation are net to be lim ited to the present territorial boundaries of the Republic of Colombia but will extend under the language of the proposed treaty to the Government of Colombia and undoubtedly to its successors no matter what political upheavals may bring about by way of enlargement or realignment of territorial boundaries It is well to remember that all of the territory now embraced within the limits of Venezuela Ecuador and Colombia orig inally formed but one country and government New Granada a very much greater area than now comprised within the politi cal limits of the Republic of Colombia and that at various times in its revolutionravaged history independent govern ments have been set up by the constituent departments or states of the Republic of Colombia There may be new federations or enlargements of territory when transportation facilities ren der possible the binding together of weak and debtridden States or Republics into a wellknit and powerful governmental en tity Are we granting rights by this treaty of unknown value Do we know just what is this birthright with which we are bar gaining Indeed if one were gifted with prophetic powers he might well say that in that day of social and industrial awaken ing which must come in no distant day to these countries oc cupying the northern part of South America there will develop that community of interest which aided by racial homogeniety will result in a Republic of continental poportions ARTICLE III Article III of this treaty is as follows The United States of America agrees to pay to the Repub lic of Colombia within six months after the exchange of the ratifications of the present treaty the sum of twenty five million dollars gold United States Money As a question of policy this clause may give rise to great di versity of opinion There is no statemenlt of why this paymentVIRGINIA LAW REIIEW is made or what it is supposed to represent or why the United States is under any pecuniary liability to Colombia There is nothing to indicate just how such a sum is arrived at The theory has been advanced that under the contracts be tween the Panama Railroad Company and Colombia that Co lombia has a reversionary interest in the Panama Railroad Com pany whose relinquishment the United States must purchase becatse the independence of Panama did not extinguish this interest It is true that the period of the concession to the Panama Railroad Company was 99 years from August 16 1867 and that at the expiration of this period the entire prop erties of the company were to revert to Colombia But this was a contract made with the then sovereign of the soil upon which the railroal concession was operative When Colombias sovereignty over the Isthmus of Panama ceased its rights in this contract were automatically extinguished It was not a personal covenant but a covenant running with the soil and inhering at all times in the owner of the soil The Republic of Panama recognizes this principle in its treaty with the United States by specifically renouncing in Article XXII any rights which under the concession might have reverted to it and con firms and grants these rights to the United States as the new owner of the land or territory to which such rights inherently attach It is said that we desire the restoration of the traditional friendship which existed between the United States and Colom bia before the Panama Incident This indeed is a most worthy object and if its accomplishment can thus be procured and the existing estrangement be blanketed with gold it would not seem to be a sum disproportionate to the object intended There certainly however must be a very grave fear among any of our own people with experience in LatinAmerican countries that the author of this idea was somewhat surfeited with am bitious optimism We undoubtedly are willing to sacrifice our dollars to really achieve friendship but would we be quite so willing if the beneficiary of our bounty could only find therein further reason for scoffing at our venality Friendship with nations as with individuals is a growth resulting from intimate 260PROPOSED TREATY BETWEEN U S AND COLOMBIA 261 business and social relationship with common ideals and aspira tions It is not to be conferred as may be a gift of gold The Latin temperament is peculiarly fitted to appreciate that that individual is capable of the highest friendship whose strength of character persists in adhering to a line of action conceived in principle and not hate and who is not given to be apologiz ing by reason thereof ARTICLE IV Article IV of the proposed treaty is a recognition by Colom bia of the Indepenednce of Panama and a delimitation of its boundaries Colombia has never recognized the independence of Panama and still regards it as one of the States of the confed eration composing the Republic of Colombia In this Article the Government of the United States also agrees that it will take the steps necessary to obain from the Governmcnt of Panama the dispatch of a duly accredited agent to negotiate and conclude a Treaty of Peace and Friendship with Colombia with a view to bringing about regular diplo matic relations and adjustment of all questions of pecuniary liability between the two countries The latter part of this arti cle is an unusual undertaking The independence of Panama has been specifically recognized by the United States and even more than that the United States guarantees and will main tain that independence of the Republic of Panama according to Article I of the Treaty of 1903 This proposed article seems to speak the language of a proprietary owner of a property which can be disposed of by him at will and would seem to be peculiarly inappropriate in the face of our solemn obligations to Panama It smacks of the coercive and any attempt on our part to force Panama into a compliance with the proposals of this treaty could only result in alienating the good will of our foster child A treaty proposing to remove differences with one country is of doubtful propriety if it must result in creating dif ferences with another country Colombia doubtless claims that Panama should assume some part of Colombias national debt to be apportioned in proportion to wealtl On the other hand Panama would probably claim an enormous indebtedness to herVIRGINIA LAW REVIEW from Colombia on account of the years of exploitation by Co lombia of the territory of Panama for the benefit of other parts of Colombia and for the failure of Colombia to give to Panama any fair share of the national revenues realized in Panama In other words the United States says in effect that it will cause Panama and Colombia to agree upon the differ ences which led to about half a hundred revolutions in as many years in Panama and ultimately separated it from Colombia and resulted in its independence Could any proposal seem more futile CONCLUSION This treaty has been submitted by the President of the United States to the Senate for its ratification The Senate Com mittee on Foreign Relations to which the treaty was referred has returned it to the Senate with a majority report recom mending that clause 1 of Article I be amended to read as fol lows The Government of the United States of America and the Republic of Colombia in their own names and in the names of their respective peoples wishing to put at rest all con troversies and differences between them arising out of the events from which the present situation on the Isthmus of Panama resulted express sincere regret that anything should have occurred to interrupt or to mar the relations of cordial friendship that had so long subsisted between the two nations that the following New Article be added viz That neither the making of this convention nor any of the stipulations herein contained shall be considered to cast any doubt or shadow upon the title of the United States to the Panama Canal which title the Government of Colombia recognizes as entire absolute and complete in the United States of America and that the treaty as thus amended be ratified by the Senate A minority report has recommended that the proposed treaty be not ratified The only difference between the original Arti cle I and Article I as amended is the inclusion of the Government of Colombia and its people in the expression of regret that anv 262PROPOSED TREATY BETWEEN U S AND COLOMBIA 263 thing should have occurred to interrupt or mar the long subsist ing relations of cordial friendship between the two nations This expression of regret came only fromi the Government of the United States and its people in the original draft of Article I The treaty as amended does not meet the objection which we have been discussing and any treaty containing tle same or similar grants of rights to Colombia is objectionable and should neither be negotiated or ratified The spirit of this treaty is the restoration to Colombia of sovereign rights in the Panama Canal Riglits are granted equal to those enjoyed by the United States and in some re spects greater rights than the United States enjoys The na ture and extent of these rights are undetermine in some cases and in many others are ambiguous Such a treaty does not ac complish its expressed purpose of putting at rest all controversies and differences It passes them on for solution tomorrow in an equally difficult form if not more difficult It embodies false economic and business principles It places a lerletual mort gage burden upon the future operation of the Panama Canal and its auxiliary railway It violates the spirit of our word pledged in a solemn treaty to Panama and can only create dis sension and strife If the United States is indebted to Colom bia in any sum let us immediately set about determining its amount anl discharge our obligations Let tis so settle this account that it is final and there may be no calls one upon the other But above all else let us i1ot settle it by creating re ciprocal and paramount rights in the Canal Zone which are an encumbrance and mortgage upon it in perpetuity Il illiamt K Jackson JACKSONVILIE FLORIDA

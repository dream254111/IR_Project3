J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1015045,MENTAL HYGIENE PROBLEMS OF NORMAL ADOLESCENCE,I242688,MENTAL HYGIENE PROBLEMS OF ADOLESCENCE MENTAL HYGIENE PROBLEMS OF NORMAL ADOLESCENCE BY JESSIE TAFT PHD DIRECTOR CHILD STUDY DEPARTMENT CHILDRENS BUREAU AND CHILDRENS AID SOCIETY OF PHILADELPHIA  ORMAL ADOLESCENCE IS A COM BINATION OF TERMS WHICH MAY PERHAPS BE CONSIDERED CONTRADICTORY IF BY NORMAL ONE MEANS AVERAGE AND AT THE SAME TIME IMPLIES PAINLESS ADOLESCENCE OR ADOLESCENCE WITHOUT CONFLICT THEN CERTAINLY THERE IS A CON TRADICTION FOR THE ADOLESCENCE WHICH OCCURS WITHOUT STRESS AND STRAIN IS TOO UNUSUAL TO BE CALLED NORMAL AND IF SUCH WERE THE USUAL THING IT WOULD OFFER NO PROBLEMS OF MENTAL HYGIENE WHAT WE ARE OBLIGED TO MEAN THEREFORE ARE THE MENTAL HYGIENE PROBLEMS THAT ARISE IN PRACTICALLY ALL ORDINARY LIVES AT ADOLES CENCE DISREGARDING THOSE EXTREMES OF MALADJUSTMENT WHICH SEEM TO POINT TOWARDS SERIOUS MENTAL BREAKDOWN IF ONE THINKS OF HUMAN LIFE AS THE CONTINUOUS STRUGGLE OF A SEGMENTAL ORGANISM SO TO ORGANIZE ITS VARIOUS NEEDS AND INTERESTS WITH RELATION TO A SOCIAL AND PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT THAT IT MAY GO FORWARD SUCCESSFULLY SATISFY ING ITSELF AND WINNING SOCIAL APPROVAL AT THE SAME TIME IF ONE CONCEIVES OF LIFE AS THE EFFORT TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN A DYNAMIC SAFETY ATTAINED BY COURAGEOUS INTELLIGENT ACTION AND A STATIC SAFETY WHICH MEANS REGRESSION AND AVOIDANCE OF ACTION AND TO SUBSTI TUTE AS FAR AS INTELLIGENCE PERMITS EX PRESSION FOR REPRESSION INDEPENDENCE FOR DEPENDENCE OBJECTIVE FOR SUBJECTIVE AND CONCRETE INTERESTS FOR DREAMSTHEN ADOLESCENCE INEVITABLY PRESENTS A CRISIS A PLACE WHERE THE STRUGGLE MUST NEC ESSARILY BE MORE AGGRESSIVE AND EFFORT FUL IF IT IS TO RESULT ADVANTAGEOUSLY FOR THE ORGANISM IDEAL ADJUSTMENT THE IDEAL OF ADJUSTMENT WHICH MENTAL HYGIENE HOLDS BEFORE US MIGHT BE STATED IN THIS WAY THE ORGANISM IS ABLE TO COORDINATE ITS OWN CRAVINGS IN ORDER THAT THEY MAY BE EXPRESSED SATISFACTORILY AND OBJECTIVELY IN WAYS SOCIALLY APPROVED THIS IMPLIES THAT ORGANISMS USE THEIR INTELLECT OR INTELLI GENCE IN MEETING THE FACTS OF EVERY SITUATION SQUARELY AND WORK OUT THEIR SATISFACTIONS IN TERMS OF THOSE FACTS THEY USE NO INDIRECT EVASIVE OR SUB JECTIVE MEANS TO ESCAPE THE PROBLEM OF WRESTING BIOLOGICAL SUCCESS FROM THE WORLD OF MEN AND THINGS AS THEY AC TUALLY ARE IN OTHER WORDS THE HEALTHY ADJUSTMENT IS THE SCIENTIFIC ADJUSTMENT WHICH CONTROLS SITUATIONS BY MASTERING THE FACTS IN THE CASE AND MANIPULATING THEM WITH INTELLIGENCE AND SKILL TO CARRY OUT THE ENDS OF THE INDIVIDUAL IT IS NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT SITUATIONS WHICH THE HUMAN BEING HAS TO MEET ARE SOCIAL AND THAT THE FACTS HE HAS TO UNDERSTAND AND WORK WITH FOR THE SOLUTION OF HIS PROBLEMS ARE SOCIAL TOO THE WAY OTHER HUMAN ORGANISMS BEHAVE IS AS IMPORTANT FOR HIM AS HIS REACTIONS TO HIS PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT THERE IS NO MORAL REASON WHY THE ORGANISM MAY NOT USE ANY CONTROL IT CAN WORK OUT BUT AS A MATTER OF FACT NO THOROUGHGOING CONTROL CAN BE ATTAINED ON ANY OTHER THAN A REALISTIC BASIS ALL OTHER METHODS ARE SUB JECTIVE AND ILLUSORY AND BREAK UNDER THE STRAIN OF LIVING IF THE MENTAL HYGIENE GOAL FOR HUMAN BEINGS IS BIOLOGICAL FULFILMENT SUCCESS OBJECTIVE EXPRESSION OF THE GREAT HUMAN INTERESTS INDEPENDENCEIN SHORT FULL GROWN ADULT INDIVIDUALITY WHICH FACES LIFE IN A POSITIVE CONSTRUC TIVE MANNERTHEN WE MUST EXAMINE ADOLESCENCE TO SEE WHEREIN IT PRESENTS 61THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY PECULIAR AND UNUSUAL OBSTACLES TO ALL YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE ATTAINMENT OF SUCH AN IDEAL WHY SHOULD LIFE BECOME MORE DIFFICULT AT THAT POINT AND HOLD SO MANY POSSIBILITIES OF DISASTER ADOLESCENCE SEEMS TO BE A CRUCIAL POINT WHICH TESTS OUT THE WHOLESOME NESS OF THE PREVIOUS DEVELOPMENT IT IS THE POINT AT WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL TAKES ON TWO SELVES TO ADULTS AROUND HIM HE IS STILL A CHILD WHEN THEY WISH HIM TO CONFORM TO THEIR DESIRES WHEN HE FAILS TO ACCEPT AUTHORITY AND BRINGS DOWN CONDEMNATION FOR HIS BEHAVIOR HE IS REPROACHED BY THE ADULT IN TERMS OF HIS AGE AND APPROACHING MANHOOD JIMMIE IS ALMOST A MAN DOESNT HE KNOW A MAN DOESNT DO THAT BUT WHEN JIMMIE ASSERTS HIS INDEPEND ENCE HE IS QUICKLY DELIVERED BACK TO THE UNFREE STATE OF CHILDHOOD INSIDE OF JIMMIE A SIMILAR CONFLICT RAGES AT TIMES HE FEELS HIMSELF A FREE INDE PENDENT INDIVIDUAL WHO CAN GO FORTH COURAGEOUSLY INTO THE WORLD LEAVING THE OPPRESSIVE WEIGHT OF FAMILY AUTHOR ITY AND INTERFERENCE BEHIND HIM BUT THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN HE SEEMS SO HELPLESS AND ALONE IN AN UNCHARTED COUNTRY THAT NOTHING SHORT OF HIS MOTHERS REASSURING PRESENCE BRINGS ANY RELIEF WHETHER JIMMIE WILL BE ABLE TO KEEP HIS FACE TURNED STEADILY FRANKLY COURAGEOUSLY TOWARD THE WORLD OF INDEPENDENCE AND RESPONSIBILITY AND SLOWLY BUT SURELY DEPRIVE HIMSELF OF THE COMFORTABLE PROTECTION OF THE FAMILY AND MATERNAL SOLICITUDE DE PENDS UPON EVERYTHING THAT HAS GONE INTO THE MAKING OF JIMMIE UP TO THIS POINT THERE ARE TWO LINES OF INQUIRY WE SHOULD HAVE TO MAKE TO DETERMINE WHAT JIMMIES CHANCES ARE AND WHAT HIS PROBLEMS ARE LIKELY TO BE FIRST AS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIS WORK OR PLAY LIFE SECOND AS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIS LOVE AND SEX LIFE WE WANT TO KNOW WHETHER JIMMIE HAS CARRIED BOTH HIS WORK AND LOVE INTERESTS BEYOND THE SUBJECTIVE AUTOEROTIC STAGE OVER INTO AN OBJECTIVE FULFILMENT AS FAR AS HIS ABILITY AND ENVIRONMENT HAVE PER MITTED DEVELOPMENT OF WORK OR PLAY LIFE ON THE WORK SIDE IS HE OCCUPIED FOR THE MOST PART WITH REALIZING CONCRETELY HIS WORK OR IF YOU WISH HIS PLAY INTERESTS IF HE WANTS A WAGON WILL HE CRY OR SULK OR HAVE A TANTRUM UNTIL HIS FATHER GIVES IN WILL HE STEAL A WAGON WILL HE BROOD OVER IT DREAM ABOUT THE WONDERFUL THINGS HE COULD DO WITH IT BUT MAKE NO EFFORT TO SECURE IT OR WILL HE APPLY HIMSELF ENERGETICALLY TO SOME PLAN FOR EARNING THE MONEY OR BUILDING A WAGON OUT OF HOMEMADE MATERIALS HOW DIFFICULT IS IT FOR JIMMIE TO PUT HIS DESIRES INTO EFFECTIVE ACTION HOW DIFFICULT IS IT FOR HIM TO GET WHAT HE WANTS IN TERMS OF THE FACTS AS THEY ARE WITHOUT EVA SION ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOR OR SUBSTITU TION OF DAYDREAM FULFILMENT MORE OVER ONE MUST ASK HOW INTERESTED IS JIMMIE IN WORK AND PLAY HAS HE A PLENTIFUL SUPPLY OF INTERESTS AND HAVE MOST OF THESE INTERESTS DEFINITE CON CRETE WAYS OF GETTING EXPRESSED THAT IS HAS JIMMIE BOTH THE DRIVES AND THE DEVELOPED TECHNIQUES FOR REALIZING THEM WHETHER OR NOT HE HAS WILL DEPEND NOT ON JIMMIE ALONE BUT ON THE ENTIRE BACKGROUND TO WHICH JIMMIES BEHAVIOR HAS BEEN A RESPONSE IF JIMMIE HAS BEEN UNDER A STRONGLY REPRESSIVE DISCIPLINE IF ALL OF HIS AT TEMPTS HAVE BEEN DISCOURAGED OR SUB JECTED TO RIDICULE IF ENVIRONMENT HAS LIMITED TOO GREATLY HIS OPPORTUNITIES IF HEALTH HAS PREVENTED AGGRESSIVE OR EFFECTIVE ACTION IF SOME INFERIORITY REAL OR IMAGINED PHYSICAL MENTAL OR SOCIAL HAS DEVELOPED A HABIT OF NON AGGRESSIVENESS A FEAR OF ATTACKING A NEW PROJECT A HESITANCY TO GO OVER INTO 6EMENTAL HYGIENE PROBLEMS OF ADOLESCENCE POSITIVE ACTION A TENDENCY TO EVADE RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE OF FEAR OF FAILURE OR EXPOSURE OF WEAKNESS THEN WE MAY EXPECT TO FIND ADOLESCENCE PRODUCING THE MOST CRITICAL PROBLEMS A CHILD WHO HAS GROWN UP ON THE SUBJECTIVE PLAN WHO HAS NEVER LEARNED TO DEAL SQUARELY WITH FACTS OR TO WIN APPRO BATION BY LEGITIMATE EFFORTS OR WHO HAS GONE INTO COMPENSATORY ACTIVITIES OF AN ANTISOCIAL OR AUTOEROTIC CHARACTER HAS BEEN ABLE TO PUT OFF THE RESULTS OF SUCH METHODS OF MEETING REALITY BE CAUSE OF HIS CHILDHOOD THE FAMILY EVEN THE SCHOOL OR THE FOSTER FAMILY WILL ACCEPT MANY SUCH BAD ADJUSTMENTS WITHOUT REALIZING HOW SERIOUS THEY ARE AS A PART OF CHILDHOOD WITH ADOLES CENCE HOWEVER COMES A POINT WHEN LIFE LOOMS UP AND EVEN THE FAMILY CAN NOT CONTINUE TO PROTECT THE CHILD FROM HIS GROWING YEARS HE MUST BEGIN TO GET THE COMEBACK FROM HIS HABITS OF POOR ADJUSTMENT THE PATTERNS HE HAS BEEN USING WILL NOT WORK IN A WORLD OUTSIDE FAMILY PROTECTION IF HE HAS NOT BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO FINDING ACTIVE CONCRETE EXPRESSION FOR HIS INTERESTS THE SUDDEN FLOOD OF NEW ENERGY THE WIDENING OF THE HORIZON THE SOCIAL IMPETUS THAT YOUTH RECEIVES WILL SWAMP HIS MOTOR APPARATUS HE HAS NO TECHNIQUES DEVELOPED AND HAS NOT THE HABIT OF TRYING TO DEVELOP THEM FOR EVERY NEW INTEREST THESE VAGUE BUT POWERFUL FORCES COMING IN UPON THE OLD SITUATION ARE DIFFICULT ENOUGH TO HARNESS INTO ACTUAL ACHIEVEMENT EVEN WITH THE BEST EF FORTS OF ADOLESCENCE THEY IMPLY THE SUBTLE ELUSIVE COMPLICATED TECHNIQUES OF SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS AND COMMUNITY LIFE THE CREATIVE EXPRESSIONS OF ART THROUGH TECHNIQUES WHICH TAKE A LIFE TIME TO MASTERTHE COMPLICATED PROC ESSES OF ALL THE VARIOUS ENTERPRISES OF AN ADULT WORLD THEY INVOLVE NOT ONLY DIFFICULT TECHNIQUES BUT THE WILLINGNESS TO FREE ONES SELF FROM THE ECONOMIC SUPPORT OF THE FAMILY AND TAKE ON RESPONSIBILITY FOR ONES OWN LIVING THERE COMES A TREMENDOUS FEAR TO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE THOUGHT OF ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE NO MONEY TO FALL BACK ON UNLESS ONE IS ABLE TO EARN IT SUPPOSING ONE SHOULD LOSE HIS JOB NO FATHER WITH OPEN POCKET BOOK TO HELP OUT NO COMFORTA BLE HOME TO DROP INTO WHEN WORK GETS UNPLEASANT WHEN THAT REALIZATION IS SUDDENLY FORCED UPON THE ADOLESCENT THERE IS OFTEN REAL TERROR BEHIND IT AND IT REQUIRES A GENUINELY HEALTHY COUR AGEOUS HABIT OF MEETING THE PROBLEM ATIC SITUATIONS IN LIFE TO MAKE THE ADJUSTMENT WITHOUT EVASION A VERY UNSTABLE GIRL OF EIGHTEEN WHO HAS BEEN FORCED TO WORK SINCE SHE WAS FIFTEEN BECAUSE SHE HAS NO FAMILY BACK OF HER RESISTS WORK AND CHANGES JOBS FREQUENTLY BUT IS OBSESSED BY FEAR AS SOON AS SHE IS WITHOUT WORK SHE HAS CONTEMPLATED PROSTITUTION AND HAS GONE SO FAR AS TO GO WITH ONE OR TWO MEN FOR THE SAKE OF AN EVENINGS ENTER TAINMENT BUT HER FEAR WHEN SHE IS NOT WORKING IS TOO GREAT TO ALLOW HER TO DEPEND ON MEN FRIENDS COMPLETELY AND SHE RESISTS THE LOOSE LIVING UNLESS SHE HAS A GOOD JOB HER DISLIKE OF WORK HER FEAR OF GROWING UP ARE SO GREAT THAT THE NECESSITY FOR WORKING HAS BEEN REGISTERED ALMOST AS A COMPULSION NEEDLESS TO SAY SHE ALSO FEARS ADULT SEX LIFE AND IS HELD BACK BY THAT THIS PARTICULAR GIRL WHOM WE SHALL CALL ALICE ILLUSTRATES THE ADOLESCENT CONFLICT WHEN THERE IS TOO GREAT A PULL BACK TOO MANY OBSTACLES ON THE SIDE OF NORMAL GROWTH HER EARLY HOME LIFE TURNED HER AGAINST MEN AND SEX BE CAUSE HER FATHER WAS AN ABUSIVE DRUNK ARD UNABLE TO SUPPORT THE FAMILY HER MOTHER PUT ALL OF HER LOVE AND DESIRE INTO THE INDULGING AND SPOILING OF HER DAUGHTER ALICE WAS TAUGHT TO DRESS ABOVE HER STATION AND FEEL HERSELF BETTER THAN OTHERS SHE WAS THE 63THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY PETTED ADORED ONLY CHILD THEN THE MOTHER DIED LEAVING ALICE TO AN UN SYMPATHETIC OVERWORKED OLD GRAND MOTHER WHOM THE GIRL HAS NEVER CEASED TO BLAME FOR HER LOST CHILDHOOD AND ITS PLEASURES ALICE SUBMITTED BUT NEVER ACCEPTED THIS CHANGE OF LIVING SHE NEVER CEASED TO LONG FOR HER MOTHER AND THE DELIGHTS OF ADORA TION DRESS AND PLEASURE OBTAINED WITHOUT EFFORT THEN THE GRANDMOTHER DIED LEAVING ALICE WITHOUT ANYONE PENNILESS AND WITH NOT EVEN A COMMON SCHOOL EDUCA TION INEVITABLY SHE WENT TO WORK WITHOUT SKILL OR TRAINING HATING THE GRANDMOTHER AND EVEN HER MOTHER FOR DYING AND LEAVING HER TO SUCH A FATE SHE HAD NEVER DEVELOPED THE KIND OF INITIATIVE AND PERSISTENCE THAT WOULD ENABLE HER TO GET EDUCATION BY NIGHT WORK SHE WAS NOT STRONG SHE CRAVED PLEASURE SHE BLAMED OTHER PEOPLE AND FATE FOR EVERY MISFORTUNE SHE DEVELOPED AN EVASIVE WAY OF MEETING EVERY UNPLEASANTNESS EVERY FAILURE OF HERS ON A JOB NOW SHE IS OFTEN LATE TO WORK SHE RESENTS CORREC TION CHILDISHLY SHE IS UNRELIABLE STAYS AWAY IF SHE HAS THE SLIGHTEST PAIN WANTS A LOT OF ATTENTION HAS NO IDEA OF BUSINESS ETIQUETTE WHEN SHE LOSES A JOB THE EMPLOYER OR A FELLOW EMPLOYE IS TO BLAME ADOLESCENCE INCREASES THE YEARNINGS FOR A HOME FOR A MOTHER TO FALL BACK ON THE ONLY OTHER OUTLET SHE CAN SEE LEADS TO THE PLEASURES WHICH MEAN SEX CABARET MOVIE DANCE HALL ALICE IS AFRAID OF SEX SHE RESISTS THE IDEA OF MARRIAGE WHAT DOES SHE WANT WITH CHILDREN LOOK HOW HER MOTHER SUF FERED AND IN THE END HAD HERSELF AND BABY TO SUPPORT SO ALICE IS CAUGHT WITH NO DEVELOPED INTERESTS NO TECHNIQUES NOTHING TO STABILIZE OR INHIBIT THE REGRESSIVE IM PULSES WHEN ONE TALKS WITH HER ONE GETS THE FULL FORCE OF THE ADOLESCENT YEARNINGS SHE WANTS TO BE SOMEBODY TO DO GREAT THINGS TO BE SUPERIOR IN HER GOOD MOODS SHE IS OVERWHELMED WITH DREAMS OF ACCOMPLISHMENT SHE PINES TO USE GOOD ENGLISH TO BE A REAL LADY THERE IS PATHOS IN HER INQUIRY AS TO WHAT YOU SAY WHEN A BOY INTRODUCES YOU TO HIS MOTHER AND HOW YOU BEHAVE IN A FASHIONABLE HOTEL DINING ROOM SUCH QUESTIONS HAVE AN IMPORTANCE THAT IS ALMOST GREATER TO HER THAN THE PROBLEM OF HOW TO KEEP STRAIGHT SEX UALLY WINNING OF SOCIAL APPROVAL IS AN EVERPRESENT BURNING DESIRE BUT SHE HAS NO PATTERNS NO HABITS NO CONTROL OVER THE DAILY DETAILS OF THE PROCESS WHEREBY THIS IS GAINED WHEN ONE TRIES TO PLACE HER IN A GOOD ENVIRON MENT WITH GIRLS OF A BETTER CLASS SHE REACTS WITH A DEEPENED SENSE OF INFE RIORITY EXPRESSED IN MORE OPEN BOAST FUL WILDNESS SHE INVENTS ADVENTURES WITH MEN TO DAZZLE THESE VIRTUOUS SUPERIOR MAIDENS THE CRAVING FOR PLEASURES AND SOMETHING TO MAKE HER FORGET INCREASES WHAT ONE WOULD DO IF IT WERE POSSI BLE IS TO HOLD ALICE LONG ENOUGH TO SEE HER THROUGH THE LEARNING OF SOME SKILL OR TECHNIQUE IN WHICH SHE COULD BE REALLY SUPERIOR AND BY WHICH SHE COULD EARN A DECENT LIVING THE DIFFICULTY IS THAT OWING TO THE AMOUNT OF INSTABILITY SHE HAS DEVELOPED IT REQUIRES ALMOST CONSTANT SUPERVISION JUST TO KEEP HER IN ONE PLACE PHYSICALLY AS WELL AS TO HOLD HER TO THE DAILY EFFORT OF MASTERING A HARD TASK IT ALSO TAKES A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY TO FLOAT THIS PROJECT FOR WHICH NO GUARANTEE OF SUCCESS CAN BE HELD OUT IT IS NOT STRANGE THAT YOUTH FINDS IT HARD TO BUCKLE DOWN TO CONCRETE AC COMPLISHMENT THE URGE OF LIFE IS SO INTENSE THE DREAMS SO QUICK AND GLORI OUS THE ACTUAL PROCESS SO SLOW DORO THY A YOUNGSTER WHO BY TEMPERAMENT AND EVERY HANDICAP OF ENVIRONMENT HAD LEARNED TO DEPEND ALMOST ENTIRELY UPON DAYDREAM FULFILMENT FOUND HER 64MENTAL HYGIENE PROBLEMS OF ADOLESCENCE SELF AT SEVENTEEN FACING THE PROBLEM OF EARNING A LIVING SHE HAD NOT ONE SIN GLE WORKEDOUT PROCESS TO MAKE HER USEFUL TO ANY HUMAN BEING SHE WAS UNSTABLE IMAGINATIVE IMPATIENT UNDE VELOPED TO THE NTH DEGREE IT LOOKED LIKE A HOPELESS PROPOSITION ALL THE AUTHORITIES PREDICTED ULTIMATE BREAK DOWN AND FAILURE ONE FAITHFUL WORKER HOWEVER TOOK HER INTO HER OWN HOME PROVIDED A STABLE BACKGROUND AND CON CENTRATED ALL HER EFFORTS ON HOLDING THE CHILD TO LEARNING ONE TECHNIQUE BY WHICH SHE COULD BECOME SELFSUPPORT ING THERE WERE UPS AND DOWNS SHE RAN AWAY SHE STAYED OUT ALL NIGHT SHE MADE LIVING A STORMY AFFAIR FOR HER FRIENDS SHE QUARRELED WITH EVERY COMPANION SHE HAD TO BE HELD DOWN TO STUDYING HER LESSONS AT NIGHT BY THE CONSTANT ATTENTION OF AN OLDER PERSON HER COURSE IN STENOGRAPHY WAS INTER RUPTED BY ABSENCES AND BAD BEHAVIOR IN THE END THE WORKER ON THE CASE TRIUMPHED THE CHILD COMPLETED THE COURSE AND TOOK A JOB SHE HAD DEVELOPED A GENUINE SKILL ALTHOUGH HER WORK RECORD FOR A LONG TIME CON SISTED OF ONE JOB AFTER ANOTHER IN RAPID SUCCESSION THE FACT THAT SHE KNEW HOW TO DO ONE THING WELL ALWAYS BROUGHT HER BACK TO WORKING AND ITS POSSIBILI TIES THE PERIODS OF KEEPING ONE JOB GREW LONGER THE UPSETS LESS DAMAGING TO WORK FRIENDS HELD ON AFTER THREE YEARS WHEN SOME OF THE ADOLES CENT CONFLICT HAD ABATED AND THE GROWING SKILL AS STENOGRAPHER HAD BEGUN TO HAVE ITS EFFECT WE FIND OUR UNSTABLE GIRL STEADIED DOWN INTO A WELL PAID RELIABLE WORKER WHOSE EMOTIONAL UPSETS ARE UNDERSTOOD AND ADJUSTED BY HER WITHOUT GIVING UP WORK WE HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THE DEVELOP MENT OF THE PLAY AND WORK INTERESTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND TRYING TO SHOW HOW A SUBJECTIVE REGRESSIVE DEVELOPMENT OR CALL IT A LACK OF DEVELOPMENT IF YOU WISH LEADS TO GREATLY HEIGHTENED CON FLICT AT ADOLESCENCE BECAUSE OF THE INCREASED PRESSURE OF INTERNAL AS WELL AS EXTERNAL FORCES DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIAL RELATION SHIPS ON THE SIDE OF THE LOVE INTERESTS THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS WHICH CAN BE SEPARATED FROM THE WORK SIDE ONLY ARBITRARILY WE FIND A SIMILAR SITUATION THE INDIVIDUAL WHOSE LOVE LIFE AND SOCIAL INTERESTS HAVE BROADENED PROGRESSIVELY AND HAVE TAKEN ON A MORE AND MORE OBJECTIVE CHARACTER MEETS THE EFFORT REQUIRED OF ADOLESCENCE TO FACE ADULT SEX AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY WITH COURAGE AND POSITIVE STRIVING THE INDIVIDUAL WHO BECAUSE OF SOME INFE RIORITY REAL OR IMAGINED PHYSICAL OR MENTAL HAS TENDED TO DEPEND UPON MOTHER LOVE OR FAMILY TOLERANCE AND HAS AVOIDED THE POSSIBLE CRITICISM OF AN OUTSIDE WORLD BY SHUTTING HIMSELF AWAY FROM OTHERS AND COMPARISON WITH THEM WILL EASILY FIND IN ADULT LOVE AND HETEROSEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS SOME THING TOO DIFFICULT TO BE FACED HE WILL EITHER DESIRE TO REMAIN IN THE SHELTERED FAMILY SITUATION WHERE HE IS LOVED NO MATTER WHAT HE DOES OR IS AND WHERE AS A CHILD HE CAN CLING AND DEPEND AND FEEL NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR LOVING BACK AGAIN OR HE WILL FIND IN THE WORLD SOMEONE WHO WILL ACCEPT HIM ON THE SAME BASIS AND ALLOW HIM TO RE MAIN INFANTILE OR CHILDISH IN HIS LOVE NEEDS SUCH A CONDITION IS OF COURSE OFTEN PRODUCED NOT BY ANY ESSENTIAL WEAK NESS OF THE INDIVIDUAL BUT BY A COM BINATION OF CIRCUMSTANCES AN INFANTILE OR UNSATISFIED FATHER OR MOTHER USING THE CHILD IN A SELFISH WAY TO APPEASE HIS OR HER OWN LOVE NEEDS PREVENTING IT FROM GROWING AWAY FROM THE PARENTAL ATTACHMENT AS IT NORMALLY SHOULD THE WIDOWHOOD OF THE MOTHER FORCING THE BOY TO TAKE THE FATHERS PLACE AND ATTACHING HIS LOVE FOR LIFE THE HANDICAP 65THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF A LONG PHYSICAL ILLNESS OR EXTREME DELICACY REINFORCING THE ORDINARY RE SISTANCE TO GOING OVER FROM THE CER TAINTY OF MOTHER LOVE TO THE WINNING OF HETEROSEXUAL LOVE UNDER CONDITIONS OF RIVALRY AND POSSIBLE DEFEAT THE ACCIDENT OF CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH DE PRIVES THE GIRL OR BOY OF CONTACT WITH THE OPPOSITE SEX AT A TIME WHEN THE TRANSFER OF LOVE INTEREST IS READY TO BE MADE AND CONDITIONS HIM OR HER TO HOMOSEXUAL OR AUTOEROTIC EXPRESSION THE REPRESSION WHICH PURITANICAL ADULTS TEACHERS PARENTS SCHOOLS ORPHANAGES PUT UPON THE NORMAL HETEROSEXUAL IMPULSES OF ADOLESCENCE WHEN ONE CONTEMPLATES ALL THE INFLUENCES THAT ARE AT WORK TO PREVENT THE COURAGEOUS OBJECTIVE DEVELOPMENT OF LOVE AND SEX ONE WONDERS WHY ADOLESCENCE EVER FOLLOWS A NORMAL BIOLOGICAL COURSE ALICE ILLUSTRATES ALMOST ALL OF THESE INFLUENCES SHE IS HELD BACK FROM MATURITY BY THE PULL OF CHILDISH CRAV INGS FOR MOTHER LOVE AND PROTECTION WHAT SHE WANTS IS NOT THE OBJECTIVE ADULT LOVE OF ONE INDEPENDENT INDI VIDUAL FOR ANOTHER BUT SUBJECTIVE SATISFACTION SHE IS NOT LOOKING FOR THE KIND OF MAN WHOM SHE CAN LOVE WITH A REAL APPRECIATION OF HIS QUALITIES AND A SHARING OF HIS INTERESTS SHE IS LOOKING FOR ANYONE WHO WILL GIVE HER THE SENSE OF SECURITY THE SPOILING AND INDULGENCE THE MOTHER SUPPLIED ALICE SEEKS NOT A MATE BUT SOMEONE TO DEVOUR SHE WILL CONSUME HER LOVE OBJECT SHE IS NOT MOTIVATED BY ANY DREAMS OF HOME AND CHILDREN HER HUNGER IS FOR A PLEASUREFUL CARE FREE EXISTENCE IN WHICH SHE IS RESPONSIBLE NEITHER FOR WORK NOR FOR LOVE EVEN ON THE PHYSICAL SIDE OF SEX ALICE HAS NO DESIRE FOR ADULT EXPRESSION SHE HAS ALL OF THE REPRESSIONS WHICH HER MOTH ERS HATRED OF MEN HER FATHERS BE HAVIOR AND CONVENTIONAL SEX TABOOS COULD PRODUCE THEORETICALLY SHE IS AS PRUDISH AS ANY CAREFULLY GUARDED VIRTUOUS MAIDEN BUT HER PRACTICE AND HER THEORY ARE AS SEPARATE AS THE POLES ALICE SINS BUT SHE REFUSES TO EMBRACE HER SIN PHYSICAL SEX IS A DISGUSTING FACT OF LIFE TO WHICH SHE YIELDS BECAUSE IT BUYS THE PLEASURES WHICH ARE ESSEN TIAL HER CONFLICT IS NONE THE LESS REAL FOR ITS INCONSISTENCY HOW TO MEET PROBLEMS OF ADOLES CENCE WHAT CAN WE DO PRACTICALLY TO MEET THE COMPLICATED PROBLEMS OF ADOLES CENCE HOW CAN WE LESSEN THE STRUG GLE OR LEND STRENGTH TO THE FORWARD LOOKING INTERESTS AND IMPULSES IF WE WAIT UNTIL ADOLESCENCE HAS BEGUN WE SHALL HAVE A DIFFICULT TASK BUT GRANT ING THAT MOST OF THE ADJUSTMENTS SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE EARLIER AND TAKING ADOLESCENCE AS WE ACTUALLY FIND IT WHAT IS POSSIBLE WE CAN SURROUND YOUTH WITH EN COURAGEMENT THERE NEED BE NO SNEERING SUPERIORITY NO RIDICULE NO TYRANNICAL AUTHORITY NO DOGMATIC OVER RULING NOTHING TO UNDERMINE THE CONFIDENCE AND ASSERTION THAT ARE NECESSARY TO APPROACH WORK AND LOVE ON AN ADULT BASIS WE CAN HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE AS FREE AS POSSIBLE TO DEVLOP THEIR OWN INTERESTS FREE TO DISCOVER FOR THEMSELVES TO EXPERIMENT EVEN TO MAKE MISTAKES WE CAN GIVE THEM FREEDOM TO EXPERIMENT IN THE ORDERING AND CONTROL OF THEIR OWN GROUP LIFE AS WELL AS THEIR INDIVIDUAL INTERESTS WE CAN RECOGNIZE AND SUPPLY THE NEED OF YOUTH FOR INTERPRETATIONS OF LIFE ETHICS RELIGIONS PHILOSOPHY SCI ENTIFIC AND SOCIAL THEORY SOMETHING GENERAL ENOUGH TO BE MASTERED VERBALLY AND USED TO REDUCE THE CHAOS OF A NEW WORLD TO A KNOWN AND FAMILIAR THING SOMETHING TO MAKE LIFE A SAFER MORE MANAGEABLE AFFAIR ADOLESCENCE CRAVES A UNIFYING THEORY TO USE AS A STEPPING STONE FROM THE SAFE LIMITS OF CHILDHOOD 66BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS OF ATYPICAL CHILDREN TO A BOUNDLESS UNIVERSE OTHERWISE TOO STRANGE TO BE FACED PARENTS AND SCHOOLS CAN SEE TO IT THAT YOUTH IS SUPPLIED WITH DEFINITE SKILLS AND TECHNIQUES THAT POTENTIAL INTERESTS GO OVER INTO ACTION THEY CAN SHOW YOUNG PEOPLE HOW TO GAIN OBJECTIVE HAPPINESS IN CREATIVE WORK THEY CAN SO EQUIP ADOLESCENCE THAT IT WILL NOT BE LEFT DEFENSELESS IN THE FACE OF AN ADULT WORLD WITH ONLY DREAMS TO OFFER THE FAMILY CAN REDUCE THE PULLBACK OF CHILDHOOD BY ENCOURAGING ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE BREAKING AWAY FROM HOME GOING AWAY TO COLLEGE WIDENING THE SOCIAL INTERESTS TO EXTEND BEYOND THE FAMILY CIRCLE THE PARENTS CAN KEEP THEIR LOVE FOR THE CHILD OBJECTIVE AND UNSELFISH AND WELCOME HIS GROWING INDEPENDENCE AND HETEROSEXUAL INTER ESTS LAST AND MOST IMPORTANT IF WE ARE WISE ENOUGH AND GROWN UP ENOUGH OURSELVES WE CAN GIVE THE ADOLESCENT AN INTERPRETATION OF SEX AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR WHICH WILL ENABLE HIM TO FACE FRANKLY HIS OWN CRAVINGS AND INFERIORI TIES REAL OR IMAGINED AND ADJUST TO THEM IN A POSITIVE CONSTRUCTIVE SPIRIT SEX INSTRUCTION AS NOW PROVIDED IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL IS NOT EQUIVALENT TO ASSISTING YOUTH TO A HAPPY EMOTIONAL ADJUSTMENT LIKE ALICE ONE MAY KNOW THE FACTS OF SEX AND HATE THEM CAN WE PROVIDE PARENTS AND TEACHERS SO WELL ADJUSTED AND UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY CAN TAKE THE ADOLESCENT AT THE CRITICAL MOMENT AND THROUGH THEIR OWN COUR AGEOUS AND POSITIVE ATTITUDES SHOW HIM THE WAY FOR NOT ONLY DOES HE NEED TO FACE SEX AND LEARN TO LOOK FORWARD TO LOVE AND MARRIAGE HE NEEDS EVEN MORE TO ACCEPT HIMSELF HONESTLY AND FRANKLY TO RECOGNIZE INFERIORITIES AND ABILITIES AND LEARN THE LESSON OF COMPEN SATION THE BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS OF ATYPICAL CHILDREN BY FREDERIC H KNIGHT PHD SUPERINTENDENT OF NEW ENGLAND HOME FOR LITTLE WANDERERS AND DIRECTOR OF ITS DEPARTMENT OF CHILD STUDY THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO SUGGEST CERTAIN PRACTICAL METHODS OF DEALING WITH ATYPICAL CHILDREN IN DETERMINING WHAT IS MEANT BY AN ATYPICAL CHILD WE MAY APPROACH A DEF INITION FROM THE STANDPOINT OF CERTAIN PHYSICAL AND MENTAL TESTS OR WE MAY REACH A DEFINITION BY A STUDY OF THE CHILDS CAREER IN THE WORLD THUS FAR THE DEFINITION REACHED BY THE FIRST PROC ESS IS AS FOLLOWS AN ATYPICAL CHILD IS ONE WHO UPON EXAMINATION IS FOUND TO BE SERIOUSLY DEFICIENT IN ONE OR MORE OF THE ABILITIES ESSENTIAL TO SOCIAL FITNESS THE DEFINITION REACHED BY THE SECOND METHOD IS AN ATYPICAL CHILD IS ONE WHOSE SOCIAL REACTIONS INDICATE THAT HE IS SERIOUSLY DEFICIENT IN THAT WHICH EX PERIENCE SHOWS IS ESSENTIAL TO SOCIAL FITNESS FOR OUR PURPOSE WE SHALL FOLLOW PORTEUS AND INCLUDE IN THE TERM SOCIAL FITNESS EARNING CAPACITY AND LEARNING CAPACITY WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO SELFSUP PORT TEMPERAMENT DISPOSITION JUDG MENT AND COMMON SENSE WHICH ARE FAC TORS IN SELFMANAGEMENT INHIBITIONS OF ANTISOCIAL INSTINCTS AND IMPULSES WHICH LEAD TO SELFCONTROL IN OUR OWN WORK WE HAVE GIVEN EX HAUSTIVE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL EXAMINA TIONS AND HAVE PAID CAREFUL ATTENTION TO THE SOCIAL HISTORY OF EVERY CHILD THE MINIMUM STAFF REQUIRED FOR THE PROPER STUDY OF A CHILD IN OUR OPINION IS AS FOLLOWS A COMPETENT SOCIAL 67

DOLLARS 10000 THE WIFE AGREES TO TAKE THE COMMUTED VALUE OF HER DOWER WHAT SUM FORMS THE BASIS FOR ASCERTAINING THE VALUE OF SUCH DOWER QUESTION ON RECENT BAR EXAMINATION IN VIRGINIA SEC 2269 OF VIRGINIA CODE READS AS FOLLOWS  WHERE LAND IS BONA FLE SOLD IN THE LIFETIME OF THE HUSBAND TO SATISFY A LIEN OR ENCUMBRANCE THEREON CREATED BY DEED IN WHICH THE WIFE HAS UNITED OR CREATED BEFORE

BE ENTITLED TO DOWER IN SAID 8URPLUS AND A COURT OF EQUITY HAVING JURISDICTION OF THE CASE MAY MAKE SUCH ORDER AS MAY SEEM TO IT PROPER TO SECURE HER RIGHT THE QUESTION THEREFORE BECOMES ONE OF INTERPRETATION OF THIS STATUTE DOES THE WORD DOWER AS HERE USED MEAN ONETHIRD OF 8AID SURPLUS FOR LIFE OR DOES IT MEAN ONETHIRD OF THE PROCEEDS OF SALE FOR LIFE PAYABLE OUT OF THE SURPLUS IT MAY BE CONTENDED IN SUPPORT OF THE LATTER VIEW THAT THE WIFE BY JOINING IN THE DEED OF TRUST DOES NOT RELINQUISH ABSOLUTELY HER RIGHT OF DOWER BUT MERELY PLEDGES IT AS SECURITY FOR HER HUSBANDS DEBT IN OTHER WORDS THAT SHE BECOMES SURETY FOR HER HUSBAND THAT THE LAND WHEN SOLD HAVINOG SATISFIED THE DEBT AND HAVING LEFT SUFFICIENT SURPLUS TO PAY HER DOWER SHE IS THEREBY SUBROGATED TO THE RIGHTS OF A SURETY AND ENTITLED TO EXONERATION OUT OF SAID SURPLUS APPLYING THE ORDINARY RULE FOR THE INTERPRETATION OF STATUTES HOWEVER IT MAY BE SEEN THAT THIS POSITION IS UNTENABLE AND THAT IT IS ONLY BY AN INGENIOUS CONSTRUCTION OR MISCONSTRUCTION OF THE STATUTE THAT IT CAN BE SUSTAINED A BORIEF REVIEW OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THIS STATUTE WAS PASSED WILL SHOW FURTHERMORE THAT WE ARE NOT CONFINED TO THE USUAL RULES OF INTERPRETATION TO ASCERTAIN THE LEGISLATURES INTENT BUT ARE GIVEN WITH THE STATUTE A PRACTICAL ILLUSTRATION OF ITS MEANING BY REFERENCE TO THE REPORT OF THE REVISORS OF THE VIRGINIA CODE OF 1849 IT MAY BE SEEN THAT THIS STATUTE WAS PASSED AS A RESULT OF166 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER JULY THE CASE OF WILSON V DAVISSON AND WAS INTENDED TO ACCORD WITH THE OPINION OF THE DISSENTING JUDGE IN THAT CASE2 THE COURT IN THIS CASE FOLLOWING THE COMMON LAW DOCTRINE HELD THAT THE WIFE HAVING JOINED IN THE DEED OF TRUST WAS ENTITLED TO NO DOWER EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS A SURPLUS AFTER PAYMENT OF DEBT SE CURED THIS WAS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLE THAT BY THE SALE THE LAND WAS CONVERTED INTO PERSONALTY AND SHE HAVING RELINQUISH ED HER DOWER RIGHT IN THE LAND COULD NOT BE ENDOWED OUT OF THE SURPLUS WHICH BY THE SALE HAD BECOME PERSONALTY JUDGE ALLEN HOWEVER DISSENTED FROM THIS OPINION AND SUSTAINED THE LOWER COURT IN ALLOWING HER DOWER OUT OF THE SURPLUS I E ONETHIRD OF THE SUR PLUS FOR LIFE AS A BASIS FOR COMMUTING THE VALUE OF HER DOWER FOLLOWING THE DECISION OF THE MAJORITY IN THIS CASE THE REVISORS OF THE CODE SUBMITTED THE FOLLOWING STATUTE TO THE LEGISLATURE  WHERE LAND IS BONA FIDE SOLD IN THE LIFETIME OF THE HUSBAND TO SATISFY A LIEN OR ENCUMBRANCE THEREON CREATED BY DEED IN WHICH THE WIFE HAS UNITED OR CREATED BEFORE MARRIAGE OR OTHERWISE PARAMOUNT TO THE WIFE SHE SHALL HAVE NO RIGHT TO BE ENDOWED IN SAID LAND THE LEGISLATURE HOWEVER ADDED THE FOLLOWING CLAUSE SO AS TO CONFORM THE LAW TO THE OPINION OF JUDGE ALLEN IN THAT CASE  BNT IF A SURPLUS OF THE PROCEEDS OF SALE REMAIN AFTER SATISFYING THE SAID LIEN OR ENCUMBRANCE SHE SHALL BE ENTITLED TO DOWER IN SAID SURPLU AND A COURT OF EQUITY HAVING JURISDICTION OF THE CASE MAY MAKE SUCH ORDER AS MAY SEEM TO IT PROPER TO SECURE HER RIGHT SINCE JUDGE ALLEN HOWEVER SUSTAINED TIIE LOWER COURT IN ALLOW ING HER ONETHIRD OF THE SURPLUS FOR LIFE AS DOWER IN SAID SURPLUS WE MAY REASONABLY CONCLUDE THAT THE LEGISLATURE INTENDED TO LIMIT HER TO THIS AMOUNT AND DID NOT MEAN TO GIVE HER COMMUTED DOWER IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE VALUE OF THE LAND SOLD THE QUESTION SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN RARELY RAISED IN THIS STATE SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THIS ACT AND IN THE RECENT CASE OF LAND V SHIPP3 IS REFERRED TO BY THE COURT AS AN UNSETTLED QUESTION WHERE IT HAS BEEN INVOLVED HOWEVER THE INTERPRETATION OF ONE THIRD OF

HOLDING THAT THE WIFE IS ENTITLED TO DOWER IN THE WHOLE AMOUNT OF THE SALE AFTER HAVING JOINED IN THE DEED OF TRUST IT IS SETTLED THEREFORE ON AUTHORITY THAT THE FORMER IS THE CORRECT VIEW AND IT SEEMS EQUALLY TRUE ON PRINCIPLE LOOKING AT THE MATTER IN THE ABSTRACT MERELY AS A QUESTION OF IN TERPRETATION OF A STATUTE THE SAME CONCLUSION WILL BE REACHED TAKING THE WORD DOWER IN ITS ORDINARY ACCEPTATION WE FIND THAT SINCE ITS FIRST INTRODUCTION INTO THIS COUNTRY WHEN DISCOVERED IN SOME LOOSE MANUSCRIPTS OF THE GRAND ASSEMBLY AT JAMES CITY IN SEPTEMBER 1664 IT HAS BEEN USED SYNONOMOUSLY WITH THE WORD THIRD17 AND SO JUST AS BY DOWER OUT OF ALL LANDS OF WHICH HUS BAND IS SEISED DURING COVERTURE IS MEANT ONETHIRD OF SUCH LANDS SO DOWER IN SAID SURPLUS MEANS ONETHIRD OF SUCH SURPLUS FOR LIFE THE CONTEXT PLAINLY SHOWS THAT NO MORE WAS INTENDED SINCE THE STATUTE EXPRESSLY PROVIDES THAT SHE SHALL HAVE NO RIGHT TO BE EN DOWED IN SAID LAND BUT ADDS THAT IF THERE BE A SURPLUS SHE SHALL BE ENTITLED TO DOWER IN SAID SURPLUS AGAIN LOOKING AT THE REASON AND SPIRIT OF THE LAW IT WAS MANI FESTLY NOT TNE INTENTION OF THE LEGISLATURE TO DO AWAY WITH THE POS SIBILITY OF SURRENDER OF WIFES DOWER WHICH WOULD BE THE INEVITABLE RESULT OF SUCH CONSTRUCTION BUT SIMPLY TO SAVE TO HER THAT WHICH SHE DID NOT INTENTIONALLY RELINQUISH TO WIT DOWER IN THE SURPLUS AND LASTLY AS TO THE EFFECTS AND CONSEQUENCES OF THE ADOPTION OF THE OHIO RULE IF IT BE HELD THAT BY JOINING IN THE DEED OF TRUST THE WIFE MERELY PLEDGED HER DOWER RIGHT AS SECURITY FOR HER HUSBANDS DEBT AND THAT SHE IS TO BE TREATED

TO BE CONFINED TO THE SURPLUS FROM THAT PARTICULAR SALE SHOULD SHE NOT NECESSARILY BE ENTITLED TO GO AGAINST ANY OTHER PROPERTY THAT HER HUSBAND MIGHT HAVE AND SO HER RELINQUISHMENT BE MERELY FORMAL AND OF NO EFFECT SO FAR AS HER CLAIM AGAINST HER HUSBANDS ESTATE IS CONCERNED SUCH BEING THE CASE SHE MIGHT IN SOLIDO OR FROM TIME TO TIME RELINQUISH HER DOWER RIGHT IN TWOTHIRDS OF HIS PROPERTY AND RETAIN THE REMAINING ONE THIRD FOR LIFE AGAINST THE CLAIMS OF ALL PERSONS WHATSOEVER IN ADDITION TO THE INJUSTICE WHICH WOULD THEREBY RESULT TO OTHERS HAVING CLAIMS AGAINST HER HUSBANDS ESTATE SUCH A CONSTRUCTION WOULD LEAD TO INTERMINABLE CONFUSION IN THE EXAMINATION OF TITLES AND SO PROVE A SERIOUS BAR TO THE FREE ALIENATION OF PROPERTY FOR EXAMPLE SUPPOSE A TO BE SEISED OF THREE FARMS OF EQUAL VALUE AND TO HAVE CONVEYED TWO IN TRUST FOR SECURITY OF DEBTS HIS WIFE UNITING SHOULD THE FARMS THUS CONVEYED IN TRUST WHEN SOLD BRING ONLY AN AMOUNT SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY THE DEBTS SECURED THE WIFES DOWER CLAIM AGAINST THE REMAINING FARM ASSUMING A TO BE SEISED OF NO OTHER REALTY WOULD BY THIS PROCESS OF SUBROGATION BE INCREASED FROM ONETHIRD INTEREST FOR LIFE TO A LIFE ESTATE IN THE WHOLE AND A PURCHASER THE VENDORS WIFE NOT JOINING WOULD TAKE SUBJECT TO THIS RIGHT INSTEAD OF TO THE USUAL DOWER RIGHT OF ONETHIRD FOR LIFE AND SO IN EVERY CASE WHERE THE WIFE JOINED IN A DEED OF TRUST HER DOWER CLAIM AGAINST THE REMAINING ESTATE OF HUSBAND WOULD BE INCREASED IN WEXAMINATION OF TITLES THEREFORE IT WOULD BECOME NECESSARY TO ASCER TAIN WHAT PROPERTV HAD BEEN MORTGAGED OR CONVEYED IN TRUST THE WIFE UNITING THE SURPLUS LEFT AFTER SATISFACTION OF DEBTS SECURED AND THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF UNINCAMBERED PROPERTY IN ORDER TO DETER MINE BY MINUTE CALCULATION THE DOWER INTEREST OF WIFE IN PROPERTY TO BE PURCHASED IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW THE THEORY OF WIFES SURETYSHIP CAN BE SUSTAINED IN ANY EVENT IN ORDER TO BE A SURETY ONE OR TWO CONDI TIONS MUST NECESSARILY EXIST THE WIFE MUST EITHER BE PERSONALLY BOUND OR ELSE MUST PLEDGE SOME PROPERTY AS SECURITY SHE IS CLEARLV UNDER NO PERSONAL OBLIGATION TO PAY THE DEBT OR TO MAKE UP ANY DEFICIT SHOULD THE LAND SELL FOR LESS THAN THE DEBT AND IT IS WELL SETTLED THAT A CONTINGENT DOWER RIGHT IS NOT PROPERTY AS SAID IN SCRIBNER ON DOWER 18  IT IS NOT EASY SAYS A DISTINGUISHED JURIST TO DEFINE THE RIGHT OF DOWER BEFORE THE DEATH OF THE HUSBAND    IT IS NOT ONLY AN INCHOATE RIGHT BUT CON 18 VOL 1 P 21902 DOWER IN SURPLUS WHERE WIFE JOINS IN DEED 169 TINGENT IT DEPENDS UPON THE DEATH OF THE HUSBAND IF HE SURVIVES HIS WIFE SHE HAS NO RIGHT TRANSMISSIBLE TO HER HEIRS NOR DURING THE LIFE OF THE HUSBAND CAN SHE GIVE IT ANY FORM OF PROPERTY TO HER ADVANTAGE     SO LONG AS THE HUSBAND SHALL LIVE IT IS ONLY A RIGHT IN LEGAL CONTEMPLATION DEPENDING UPON THE GOOD CONDUCT OF THE WIFE AND THE DEATH OF THE HUSBAND UNTIL THE DEATH OF THE HUSBAND THE RIGHT IF IT MAY BE CALLED A RIGHT IS SHADOWY AND FICTITIOUS AND LIKE ALL RIGHTS WHICH ARE CONTINGENT MAY NEVER BECOME VESTED  SIMILAR LANGUAGE IS EMPLOYED IN THE CASE OF MOORE V CITY OF NEW YORK IT IS THERE SAID THAT THE INCHOATE INTEREST OF THE WIFE IS A RIGHT TO CLAIM FOR DOWER CONTINGENT UPON HER SURVIVING HER HUSBAND SUCH A POSSIBILITY MAY BE RELEASED BUT IT IS NOT IT IS BELIEVED THE SUBJECT OF GRANT OR ASSIGNMENT NOR IS IT IN ANY SENSE AN INTEREST IN REAL ESTATE SEE TO

WHERE THIS QUESTION HAS BEEN INVOLVED AND IN VIEW OF THE EFFECTS AND CONSEQUENCES OF THE INGENIOUS INTERPRETATION SUGGESTED IT IS SAFE TO SAY THAT THE PROPER BASIS FOR COMMUTING THE WIFES DOWER IN

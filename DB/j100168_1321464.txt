in 5 HARVARD LAW REVIEW 148 has been finially adjudicated by the Court of Appeals of New York in favor of the defendant The bill was for an injunctionL to prevent the defenidanits from completing a statue of a deceased lady of whom the plainitiff was the nephew and stepson and from dlisplaying it first at the Worlds Fair under the title of rThe rypical Plilanitlhropist and then in the roomiis of the Ladies Art Association in New York Mr Justice Peck ham in clistmissing the bill took especial care to say that the decision could not be takeni as a denial of the right to privacy or of that altogether inde penlent riglht which the next ofkin of a deceased person might have in the privacy of that persons past life and he put the decision upoIn the ground that in the case in question there were nio circulmstances wlhich gave the plaintiff good reason to pray for an inijuinction The reasoning was that tlle deceased could not lhave shrunk from the anticipation of a publicity after herNOTES 355 death however much she might have done so had it been attempted during her life and that consequently no evidence of her desire to avoid publicity could be relevant to the plaintiffs case Further and in general the statue was not to be used in any way which could give a  sane and reasonable person  any complaint on his owii account though he were her nearest relative Reduced to its formal parts the decision would therefore seem to be a denial only of equitable jurisdiction and not of the plaintiffs legal right It may be fairly said that the court admitted that a tort was proposed by the defendant but found no sufficient reason for giving the extraordinary remedy of a court of equity and left the plaintiff to hiis remedy at law The case is quite new in its particular features since the injuinctions previously granted e g against the reproduction of photographs publication of letters and the like were all cases where the defendant proposed to give a publicity for his own profit regardless of whether it was calculated to do honor to the plain tiff or not Moreover this was a case where equitable jurisdiction cannot be said to flow necessarily from the facts as in the case of a proposed tort to land but is rather analogous to a bill for the recovery of a chattel in specie depending upon its particular circumstances for equitable jurisdiction In the exercise of its discretion in cases of this sort a court has such latitude that it is impossible or at least presumptuous to say it has come to a wrong decision unless that be obviously absurd and unreasonable So in this case the decision of the court must be held to be justified even by those who might disagree with the result had it been their place to decide the case for there is surely nothing preposterouis or absurd in saying that here the plaintiffs loss could be sufficiently compensated by money damages But the reasoning of the court with all respect to the learned judge who delivered the opinion is not altogether satisfactory Since the question be fore them was not to be governed by the decisions of the lower courts and their position was not that of reviewing the decision of an independent tri bunal e g the verdict of a jury there was no occasion to hold that no  sane and reasonable person  could uphold the decision of those lower courts and it was a statement which their very unanimity in combination with the vigorous dissent ini the Court of Appeals itself ought to have effectually disproved Further the line of reasoning by which the plaintiffs evidence of the deceaseds dislike of publicity was excluded as irrelevant to his own proof of damages can be assented to with difficulty It is surely a mistaken view of the ordinary facts of human feeling to say that a naturally retiring person can tolerate the anticipatioin of a publicity after his death from which he would shrink painfully during his life Surely a person to whom privacy is of any value whatever must contemplate a futuire publicity with almost as much chagrin as a present one Could the learned judge for example bear for an instant the thought of a public representation or description of his couirtship after his death Now if this is so the knowledge of how great annoyance would have been caused to the deceased had slhe lhad knowledge of the defendants proposition was a very material element in the plaintiffs damages for surely it is a source of pain to every normal person to know that that is contemplated which would have caused suffering to any one dear to himn who is now dead Indeed it is unnecessary to give proofs of that feeling they are so obvious Finally the case seems a good instance of the ill effects of the loose sys356 HA R VAR D LAZ W RE EVIE W tem of pleading used in New York It is doubtful whether the decision would lhave been received by the press in general as it has been as a denial of the right to piivacy were the juirisdictions of law and equity distinguislhed ancI certainly it would have been more easily limited to its proper scope As has been intimated it cannot fairly be complained of hlowever much some of the reasoning of the opinioni may seem to need further exegesis to gain acceptance

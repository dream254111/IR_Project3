 XXIX Sequel to a paper on the Reduction of the Thiermmetrical Observations ade at the Apartments of the Roya Society By JAM ES GLAISHER Esq F RS of the Royal Observatory Greenwich Received December 14 1849Read February 28 1850 IN a paper which the Royal Society did me the honour to publish in the last volume of its Transactions I gave the results found from all the thermometrical observations whichl have been taken at the Apartments of this Society and I stated that I had made some progress in the connection of this series of results with those deduced from the observations at the Royal Observatory Greenwich Since that time I have reduced the two series of observations to one and the same series and I have now the honour to lay the results from their combination before the Society In my former paper I stated that no observations had been taken between the years 1781 and 1786 Had the particulars of these years been about their average values their omission would not have materially affected the final results but on examination I found that those years were distinguished by very severe weather and that their omission would have a sensible effect I have therefore supplied these par ticulars as detailed below I also stated that it was doubtful whether the temperatures as determined for So mnerset House were influenced by local causes I have endeavoured to collect in formation upon this subject and of which I shall speak presently I shall adopt the same plan in the arrangement of the final results which I pursued in my former paper and present them for month ly quarterly and yearly periods The numbering of the Tables is continued from the former paper It may tend to clearness if I speak of each preliminary investigation separately Determination of the Mean Temperature of the Air at Lyndon in Rutlandshire the longitude of which place is 00 3 East of Greenwich and the latitude is 520 32 Northfor every month in the years fronz 1771 to 1799 The results of meteorological observations taken by THOMAs BARKER Esq at Lyn don in Rutlandshire and which seems to have been taken with care were published in the volumes of the Philosophical Transactions for the years 1772 to 1799 From these papers I have determined the nean monthly temperatures of the air and which are shown in the following Table MDcccL 4 D570 MR GLAISHER ON THE THERMOMETRICAL OBSERVATIONS

gentleman on my request to furnish me with the monthly means of his observations for comparison with those of this Society most promptly and obligingly sent me the monthly mean from twentyeight years

GREENWICH 575 By taking the mean of the numbers in each column of differences we find that the temperature of the air at the Apartments of the Royal Society in 0 January was higher than at Epping

reduced to the same level by 02 November was higher than at Epping reduced to the same level by  1 iDe ember was higher than at lEpping reduced to the same level by  PS And the mean temperature of the whole period was nearly of the same value at both places Having obtained these results and finding that during the timne the sun was situated north of the equator the temperature at the Apartments of the Royal Society was lower than at Epping and that it was higher during the time the sun had south declination I requested Mr SQUIRE to furnish me with full particulars with respect to the position of his instrument to the sun and to surrounding objects the follow ing is the information he gave me The thermometer hangs near the north angle of a small projecting pier of a wall nearly close to the brickwork facing the NE and an open country At the back of thie wall is a grapevine and when in leaf it so shades the wall that its tem perature is not much affected by the suns rays but before the vine is in leaf it may raise the temperature a trifle yet from some casual observations scattered over my journal as tests I do not find that the said thermometer is sensibly influenced by the heat of the sun at 8 AM the time of reading the instrument On the 13th of May 1847 1 moved the thermometer a few feet from its former position on the wall with the same aspect but at the back of this part of the wall there is a sort of grotto or summerhouse which is covered by thatch and completely interrupts the suns rays from the wall hence its present situation may perhaps be considered more eligible for a mean temperature than its former position but I do not find any difference worth notice  The general fact however of a higher winter temperature and of a lower summer temperature at the Apartments of the Royal Society is satisfactorily proved by both sets of comparisons and it is evident that the same cause has been in operation at both times and to the same amount There can be no doubt that this cause is the vicinity of the river Thames to the locality of the observations576 MR GLAISHER ON THE THERMOMETRICAL OBSERVATIONS TAKEN AT Determinahiton of the M1onthly Mean Temperature of the water of the Thames by night and by dayfrom the year 1846 to the yeai 1849 The observations to determine the temperature of the Thames water are made by Lieut SANDERS RN The instruments consist of one maximum thermometer and of one minimum thermometer suspended from the sides of the Dreadnought Hospital Ship in a perforated trunk placed at about 2 feet below the surface of the water The range of temperature during the day is usually about 20 and the simple arithmetic mean of the readings of the maximum and mminiutn thermonmeters shows the mean temperature of the water TABLE XIIIMean

415 420 439 405 422 403 368 386 By comparing the means of these numbers for the four years with the means of the readings of the maximum and minimum thermometers in air at the Royal Ob servatory for the satme months we find that the mean lowvest readings of the water were higher in the twelve months respectively by 309  40 6 707  1203 1 105  1607 1204 1004 jq07 608 603 and 409 than the mean of

are very large and will fully account for the little higher temperature possessed by places in the vicinity of the river and these differences of temperature are probably the fruitful source of the London fogs Mr SANDERS at my request has taken daily observations of the temperature of the air at 32 feet above the water of the Thames at the hours of 6 AM and 6 PM during the years 1847 and 1848 and at the hours of 9 Am and 9 PM in the year 1849 The result of these observations compared with Simultaneous observations taken at the Royal Observatory is as followsthat the temperature of the air 32 feet aboveTHE ROYAL SOCIETY AND AT THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY GREENWICH 577 the water exceeds that at the observatory at 6 AM by 106 i0 V 008 003 00 6 07 0 9 008 002 0O and 00 SS in the twelve months

by 004 May by 202 June by 004 and in October by 005 that it was of a lower temperature in July by 007 August by 005 and in September by 001  that at 9 PM it was always of a higher temperature the excesses were 001 003 007 003 109 209 105  302 102 and 103 respectively From these numbers it seems that during the night hours at all seasons of the year the temperature of the air at the Dreadnought Hospital Ship is higher than at the Observatory and that it is below only during the midday hours At times of extreme temperature the effect of the water upon the temperature of the air is very great On February 12 1847 the temperature of the air at my house which is situated about one mile and a half from the rivet was 600 the lowest reading 322 feet above the water of the TIatmes was 1600 the temperature of the water was 330 its heating effect upon the air in its immediate vicinity amounted to 10 at the Observatory the reading was 1005 and the heat of the water of the Thames seems to have influenced the temperature of the air at the Observatory to the amount of 40 Some time since on comparing the temperatures of the air as recorded in the Philosophical Transactions in the year 1814 with corresponding tenm peratures as observed at Greenwich I doubted the accuracy of the former in many instances on account of their much higher values these investigations have now led me to believe that the temperatures as recorded in the Philosophical Transactions for that year are correct TABLE XIVComparison of the mean temperature of the Air at St Johns Wood and at the Royal Observatory

40S 1 420 115 4E 2580 MR GLAISHER ON THE THERMOMETRICAL OBSERVATIONS TAKEN AT By taking the means of the numbers in each column of differences we find that the temperature of the air at the Apartments of the Royal Society was Higher than at the Royal Observatory Greenwich in January bv   P6 Higher than at the Royal Observatory Greenwichl in February by  1P4 Higher than at the Royal Observatory Greenwich in March by   1 Higher than at the Royal Observatory Greenwich in April by   1 Higher than at the Royal Observatory Greenwich in May by    1 Higher than at the Royal Observatory Greenwich in June by    09 Higher than at the Royal Observatory Greenwich in July by    10 Higher than at the Royal Observatory Greenwich in August by   13 Higher than at the Royal Observatory Greenwich in September by  11 Higher than at the Royal Observatory Greenwich in October by   13 Higher than at the Royal Observatory Greenwich in Novernber by  13 Higher than at the Royal Observatory Greenwich in December bv  14 And upon the whole year the excess of temperature at Somerset House was 102 and to reduce readings taken at Somerset House to those at Greenwich it is necessary to subtract the preceding numbers from them  and it is necessary to increase the read ings of the Royal Observatory by the above numbers to make them comparable with those taken at the Royal Society One part of these differences is owing to the difference of elevation and which will amount to about 003 the greater part of the remaining difference is most probably owing to the vicinity of the water of the Thames whose temperature during the night hours at all seasons of the year is several degrees higher than that of the air see remarks following Table XIII The general result of the preceding investigations with respect to the temperatures of London and the country is that those parts of London situated near the river Thames are somewhat warmer upon the whole year than the country but that those parts of London which are situated at some distance from the river do not enjoy higher temperatures than those due to their latitudes I proceed now to reduce the results at Somerset House to those of the Royal Ob servatory Greenwich by applying the numbers following the preceding Table to the nuinlers in Table I of my former paper and to those in Table X till the year 1840 After this date the numbers are extracted from the several volmines of the Greenwich Meteorological ObservationsTHE ROYAL SOCIETY AND AT THE ROYALJ OBSERVATORY GREENWICH 581 TAB9LE XVIIShoWinDg the mea n temperature of ceach month

may be as large as 200 and of the summer months of l 10 or 120 By taking the means of the numbers in the Table in different groups of years the next Table is formed TABLE XIXShowing the mean

temperature is greatest in the winter months its mean value in January is 301  in both February and March is 206 in April is 203 in May and June is 200 in the months of August September and October whose tem peratures are the steadiest it is 109 in November it is 200 and in December it is 301 as iii January The numbers in the preceding Table very clearly show that causes exist at different times which raise or depress the temperature and which continue through long periods As in the distribution of the positive and negative signs in the space of seventy nine years we perceive a gradual increasing preponderance of the positive signs over the negative signs it seems that the temperature of the climate during this period has increased As the mean results from so long a series of observations may be considered as true having the advantage of being free from errors of observation and from those arising from imperfect instruments we may really consider the numbers in the above Table as abnormal values yet as it seems most desirable to have those at the beginning of the series confirmed by the description of each year made without instrumental means for this purpose as well as for the comparison of the character of the climate at the beginning and at the end of the series I have collected the following brief particulars of every year till that of 1800 after this time the general characters of the years are well known 1771There were frequent and very sharp frosts till April 20 On February 12 the reading of the thermometer was as low as 40 the month of May was warm the summer was cool and dry October was a wet and windy month and the weather was mild to the end of the year The severe weather of the beginning of the year caused a bad seed time and the harvest was very late 1772The beginning of the year was mild  from the middle of January frosts and great snows were frequent and continued to the middle of March The summer was very fine the autumn was mild but wet and there was no frost till December 22 1773With the exception of the latter part of February which was stormy and wet there was much fine weather till the beginning of May then many mornings were frosty after which heavy rain fell frequently till June The summer was fine the autumn was wet There were sharp frosts at the end of November and at the beginning of December 1774The year began with severe frost and for nearly two months the ground was frostbound  occasionally there were great rains or snow the weather was more moderate in April the summer was cool with heavy rains The autumnal months were wet particularly in September Some snow fell in November and beginning of December This year was remarkably wet 1775rrhe weather was mild at the beginning of the year The summer was dry MIDCCCL 4 F586 IMR GLAISHER ON THE THERMOMETRICAL OBSERVATIONS TAKEN AT and hot thunderstorms were frequent in autumn The year was very fine and grain was cheaper than it had been for many years past 1776In January there fell a greater quantity of snow than had fallen for some years and the frost was supposed to have been the most severe since 1740 The frost went away at the beginning of February and the weather following was mild and wet it became hot about the middle of April May was cold and dry with north winds after this the weather was mostly fine till the end of December when there was a sharp frost 1777The year began with a sharp frost and heavy falls of snow continued till towards the end of February for a few days about the end of March the weather was unusually hot the reading of the thermometer being nearly 700 after this the weather was windy and cold till June The latter part of the summer and autumn was fine The year ended with frost and snow 1778There were frost and snow at the beginning of the year the beginning of April was fine The summer was fine and hot supposed at the time to have been as fine a summer as that of 1762 if not as fine as the summer of 1750 Frosty mornings began in September but were less frequent afterwards On the last day of this year there was a violent storm supposed by some to have been as violent as that of 1703 1779After the beginning of January there was no frost the spring months were remarkably warm In February wall fruit flowered the middle of April was quite hot as was the summer and autumn about the middle of November there was a little frost and again on December 22 there was much sickness this year 1780This year began with a frost almost as severe as that in 1772 there was not much snow and the weather continued severe till near the end of February The month of March was warm it was hot from July to September and mostly mild till Christmas when a frost set in The year was sickly 1781There was a little frost at the beginning of the year the spring was mild the summer was hot and the ground was much burned Autumn was fine and plea sant and there were only a few frosty mornings during the remainder of the year 1782The beginning of the year was mild but in February it was frosty and the remainder of the winter was severe the spring was cold nearly 12 inches of rain fell in April and May the weather was fine in June but bad afterwards the autumn was cold it was severe in November and during the first half of December 1783The spring was pleasant with frosty mornings very constant till near April A remarkable haze was prevalent all over Europe during the summer The autumn was fine and the weather was mostly mild till the last week in December when a great fall of snow took place 1784There was steady frost with snow till February 21 and till the end of March the mornings were frosty and at the end of March there were cold winds with snow This weather continued till the middle of April and till the first week in May frosty mornings were fiequent and the remainder of May was exceedingly hot ThereTHE ROYAL SOCIETY AND AT THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY GREENWICH 587 were a few hot days in July but the weather was precarious throughout the autumn and in December the frost was as severe as it was in January 1785The severe frost of the preceding month broke early in January but on the last day of that month a second very severe frost set in and continued till the middle of March This winter was most severe The summer and part of autumn were showery a heavy fall of snow took place at Christmas with severe frost 1786The frosts at the beginning of the year were of short duration From the beginning of March there was a severe frost of a fortnights duration and cold E and NE winds were prevalent with frosty mornings till the beginning of May June and July were moderately fine August was cold and showery and from this time to the end of the year there was a great deal of rain 1787The year began with open weather April was cold with N winds and vegetation was stopped during April and May frosty mornings were frequent and there was a sharp frost on the morning of the 7th of June it was a cold summer the autumn was mild and there was a heavy fall of snow and a weeks frost at the end of the year 1788January and February were mild the latter month being wet there was a fortnights frost in March there were several periods of hot weather in April May and June The summer was in general dry autumn was fine there was a gentle frost at the beginning of December then an exceedingly severe frost set in with heavy falls of snow which continued to the end of the year This year was remarkable for abundance of fruits c 1789Very heavy storms of wind and snow took place till the middle of January and large rivers were frozen over there was a great loss of fish in ponds from the severity of the cold After the frost broke the weather was mild but windy and wet During March there were nearly constant N winds and heavy falls of snow were frequent with sharp frost The summer was mostly wet August was fine after which it was again wet and continued so to the end of the year with scarcely any frost 1790The weather was mild and open till April when the first snow fell in the year and the weather during the beginning of this month was the most severe during the winter The summer was cool cloudy and windy autumn was fine and pleasant December was stormy with very changeable weather 1791Till January 6th there was frost after this the weather was mild till to wards the end of April there were many frosty mornings with cold NE winds in May The former part of the summer was cold frosty mornings were frequent till the middle of June the latter part of summer and autumn During November and December there were frequent storms and falls of snow and frost 1792There were frequent sharp frosts till March with stormy and wet weather the beginning of March was mild after this there was a frost of a weeks durations The summer was wet and cold the autumn was wet and December was cloudy with very little frost This year was very wet 4rF2588 MR GLAISHER ON THE

frost which continued till the end of JanuaryI February was very mild the spring was warm till May which was cold July was hot the autumn was wet but mild as was the first part of December but the wea ther during the latter half of the month was severe with heavy snow 1795The frost began about the middle of December 1794 was excessively severe in January and continued till the end of March There were very large falls of snow and the consequent floods were so great that nearly all the bridges in England were injured Some snow fell in April The summer was cold with frequent frosty morn ings till June there were some hot days in July but it was generally cold after this the weather was fine till autumn In December much injury was done to shipping by the strong S and SW winds there was no frost 1796January was remarkably warm with occasional thunderstorms there was no frost till March and then of no long duration The summer was cool the autumn was fine with a few frosty mornings at the end of November in December a severe frost set in and the reading of the thermometer in many places on the 24th was below zero of FAHRENHEITS scale 1797During a few days in January the frost continued after this till the end of March scarcely any rain fell and the weather was fine with frequent frost From April to September there were frequent heavy rains The summer was cold there was some warm weather in July the autumn in general fine and the weather con tinued open till the end of the year 1798With the exception of a few slight frosts which occasionally occurred till March the weather was open and mild The summer was fine as was autumn and the beginning of December  after this a very severe frost set in and the reading of the thermometer was as low as 5O 1799The severe frost which set in about the middle of the preceding month continued to the middle of January and again set in towards the end of the month with much snow which continued during the first week in February some Snow fell in March and the mornings were frosty till the end of the month From April to the middle of November was wet December was foggy and after the 17th a severe frost set in with snow falling The whole year was remarkably cloudy If we compare the character of the preceding years with the abnormal differences shown for the samne year s in Table XX the agreement is most satisfactory and leaves no doubt upon the correctness of the numbers at the beginning of this series I do not think it necessary to describe the years from that of 1800 as most of them are well described by LUKE HOWARD in

average and the sign  denotes that it was above the average These numbers do not at all confirm the idea that a hot summer is either preceded or followed by a cold winter or vice versd on the contrary it would see n that any hot or cold period has been mostly accompanied by weather of the same character The cold year of 1771 was followed by two cold years The hot year of 1779 was preceded by one warm year and followed by two others In 178f the extreme cold of January was more than counterbalanced by the extreme heat of March The cold year of 1782 was followed by a long series of cold years The very cold year of 1799 was followed by a cold autumn and winter The warm year of 1806 was preceded by a warm winter rThe very cold year of 1814 the last very cold year we have had was preceded by a cold summer autumn and winter The hot vear of 1818 as pre ceded by a mnoderate winter and was followed by a warm one The hot year of 1822 was preceded by a warm winter and was followed by a

those of the air at Greenwich but of less amount and they indicate the gret influence the presence of a tidal river has upon the meteorological elements of the district through which it passesTHE ROYAL SOCIETY AND AT THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY GREEN wiCH 607 The subjects of this paper are the determination of mean numerical values and the establishment of the laws of periodic variation from the long series of observa tions which were taken under the direction of this Society combined with that still being made at Greenwich I have not attempted to deduce any rules for nonperiodic variations It is most fortunate that through all reports this series of observations continued unbroken for so many years and that it did not cease till that at Greenwich had been in operation for two or three years The number of observations treated of in this paper exceeds 200000 spread nearly equally over seventynine years and the results generally are important additions to science I consider the determination of the mean temperature at Greenwich as a real addition it is probably the best determination of this element of any spot on the globe and it will help to an accurate knowledge of the mean temperature of its sur face I may however here remark that none of the mean results in this paper could have been calculated if observations at equal intervals had not been taken throughout the twentyfour hours and continued for a few years The observations at Greenwich have supplied this want It was upon them taken for five years I based my deter minations of curve of hourly mean temperature and by this means have made all the observations available As it is difficult to have instruments read more frequently than twice or thrice in a day yet to make these available it is necessary that the laws of diurnal changes of temperature be known and where such is riot the case an effort should be made in all countries to have a series of hourly or bihourly observations made for a few years so as to be able to deduce useful results Such series of frequent observations need not be made near each other as it is found that the observations made over a con siderable extent of country are subject to the same general laws

 XXIX SEQUEL TO A PAPER ON THE REDUCTION OF THE THIERMMETRICAL OBSERVATIONS ADE AT THE APARTMENTS OF THE ROYA SOCIETY BY JAM ES GLAISHER ESQ F RS OF THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY GREENWICH RECEIVED DECEMBER 14 1849READ FEBRUARY 28 1850 IN A PAPER WHICH THE ROYAL SOCIETY DID ME THE HONOUR TO PUBLISH IN THE LAST VOLUME OF ITS TRANSACTIONS I GAVE THE RESULTS FOUND FROM ALL THE THERMOMETRICAL OBSERVATIONS WHICHL HAVE BEEN TAKEN AT THE APARTMENTS OF THIS SOCIETY AND I STATED THAT I HAD MADE SOME PROGRESS IN THE CONNECTION OF THIS SERIES OF RESULTS WITH THOSE DEDUCED FROM THE OBSERVATIONS AT THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY GREENWICH SINCE THAT TIME I HAVE REDUCED THE TWO SERIES OF OBSERVATIONS TO ONE AND THE SAME SERIES AND I HAVE NOW THE HONOUR TO LAY THE RESULTS FROM THEIR COMBINATION BEFORE THE SOCIETY IN MY FORMER PAPER I STATED THAT NO OBSERVATIONS HAD BEEN TAKEN BETWEEN THE YEARS 1781 AND 1786 HAD THE PARTICULARS OF THESE YEARS BEEN ABOUT THEIR AVERAGE VALUES THEIR OMISSION WOULD NOT HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED THE FINAL RESULTS BUT ON EXAMINATION I FOUND THAT THOSE YEARS WERE DISTINGUISHED BY VERY SEVERE WEATHER AND THAT THEIR OMISSION WOULD HAVE A SENSIBLE EFFECT I HAVE THEREFORE SUPPLIED THESE PAR TICULARS AS DETAILED BELOW I ALSO STATED THAT IT WAS DOUBTFUL WHETHER THE TEMPERATURES AS DETERMINED FOR SO MNERSET HOUSE WERE INFLUENCED BY LOCAL CAUSES I HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO COLLECT IN FORMATION UPON THIS SUBJECT AND OF WHICH I SHALL SPEAK PRESENTLY I SHALL ADOPT THE SAME PLAN IN THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE FINAL RESULTS WHICH I PURSUED IN MY FORMER PAPER AND PRESENT THEM FOR MONTH LY QUARTERLY AND YEARLY PERIODS THE NUMBERING OF THE TABLES IS CONTINUED FROM THE FORMER PAPER IT MAY TEND TO CLEARNESS IF I SPEAK OF EACH PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION SEPARATELY DETERMINATION OF THE MEAN TEMPERATURE

METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS TAKEN BY THOMAS BARKER ESQ AT LYN DON IN RUTLANDSHIRE AND WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN TAKEN WITH CARE WERE PUBLISHED IN THE VOLUMES OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS FOR THE

THE SUN AT 8 AM THE TIME OF READING THE INSTRUMENT ON THE 13TH OF MAY 1847 1 MOVED THE THERMOMETER A FEW FEET FROM ITS FORMER POSITION ON THE WALL WITH THE SAME ASPECT BUT AT THE BACK OF THIS PART OF

FOR A MEAN TEMPERATURE THAN ITS FORMER POSITION BUT I DO NOT FIND ANY DIFFERENCE WORTH NOTICE  THE GENERAL FACT HOWEVER OF A HIGHER WINTER TEMPERATURE AND OF A LOWER SUMMER TEMPERATURE AT THE APARTMENTS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY IS SATISFACTORILY PROVED BY BOTH SETS OF COMPARISONS AND IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE SAME CAUSE HAS BEEN IN OPERATION AT BOTH TIMES AND TO THE SAME AMOUNT THERE CAN BE NO

DECEMBER BV  14 AND UPON THE WHOLE YEAR THE EXCESS OF TEMPERATURE AT SOMERSET HOUSE WAS 102 AND TO REDUCE READINGS TAKEN AT SOMERSET HOUSE TO THOSE AT GREENWICH IT IS NECESSARY TO SUBTRACT THE PRECEDING NUMBERS FROM THEM  AND IT IS NECESSARY TO INCREASE THE READ INGS OF THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY BY THE ABOVE NUMBERS TO MAKE THEM COMPARABLE WITH THOSE TAKEN AT THE ROYAL SOCIETY ONE PART OF THESE DIFFERENCES IS OWING TO THE DIFFERENCE OF ELEVATION AND WHICH WILL AMOUNT TO ABOUT 003 THE GREATER PART OF THE REMAINING DIFFERENCE IS MOST PROBABLY OWING TO THE VICINITY OF THE WATER OF THE THAMES WHOSE TEMPERATURE DURING THE NIGHT HOURS AT ALL SEASONS OF THE YEAR IS SEVERAL DEGREES HIGHER THAN THAT OF THE AIR SEE REMARKS FOLLOWING TABLE XIII THE GENERAL RESULT OF THE PRECEDING INVESTIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE TEMPERATURES OF LONDON AND THE COUNTRY IS THAT THOSE PARTS OF LONDON SITUATED NEAR THE RIVER THAMES ARE SOMEWHAT WARMER UPON THE WHOLE YEAR THAN THE COUNTRY BUT THAT THOSE PARTS OF LONDON WHICH ARE SITUATED AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE RIVER DO NOT ENJOY HIGHER TEMPERATURES THAN THOSE DUE TO THEIR LATITUDES I PROCEED NOW TO REDUCE THE RESULTS AT SOMERSET HOUSE TO THOSE OF THE ROYAL OB SERVATORY GREENWICH BY APPLYING THE NUMBERS FOLLOWING THE PRECEDING TABLE TO THE NUINLERS IN TABLE I OF MY FORMER PAPER AND TO THOSE IN TABLE X TILL THE YEAR 1840 AFTER THIS DATE THE NUMBERS ARE

DENOTE THAT IT WA ABOVE THE AVERGETHE ROYAL SOCIETY AND AT THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY GREENWICH 585 BY TAKING THE MEANS OF THE NUMBERS IN EACH COLUMN WITHOUT RESPECT TO SIGN WE FIND THAT THE VARIABILITY OF

WHOSE TEM PERATURES ARE THE STEADIEST IT IS 109 IN NOVEMBER IT IS 200 AND IN DECEMBER IT IS 301 AS III JANUARY THE NUMBERS IN THE PRECEDING TABLE VERY CLEARLY SHOW THAT CAUSES EXIST AT DIFFERENT TIMES WHICH RAISE OR DEPRESS THE TEMPERATURE AND WHICH CONTINUE THROUGH LONG PERIODS AS IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SIGNS IN THE SPACE OF SEVENTY NINE YEARS WE PERCEIVE A GRADUAL INCREASING PREPONDERANCE OF THE POSITIVE SIGNS OVER THE NEGATIVE SIGNS IT SEEMS THAT THE TEMPERATURE OF THE CLIMATE DURING THIS PERIOD HAS INCREASED AS THE MEAN RESULTS FROM SO LONG A SERIES OF OBSERVATIONS MAY BE CONSIDERED AS TRUE HAVING THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING FREE FROM ERRORS OF OBSERVATION AND FROM THOSE ARISING FROM IMPERFECT INSTRUMENTS WE MAY REALLY CONSIDER THE NUMBERS IN THE ABOVE TABLE AS ABNORMAL VALUES YET AS IT SEEMS MOST DESIRABLE TO HAVE THOSE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SERIES CONFIRMED BY THE DESCRIPTION OF EACH YEAR MADE WITHOUT INSTRUMENTAL MEANS FOR THIS PURPOSE AS WELL AS FOR THE COMPARISON OF THE CHARACTER OF THE CLIMATE AT THE BEGINNING AND AT THE END OF THE SERIES I HAVE COLLECTED THE FOLLOWING BRIEF PARTICULARS OF EVERY YEAR TILL THAT OF 1800 AFTER THIS TIME THE

ROYAL SOCIETY AND AT THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY GREEN WICH 607 THE SUBJECTS OF THIS PAPER ARE THE DETERMINATION OF MEAN NUMERICAL VALUES AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE LAWS OF PERIODIC VARIATION FROM THE LONG SERIES OF OBSERVA TIONS WHICH WERE TAKEN UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THIS SOCIETY COMBINED WITH THAT STILL BEING MADE AT GREENWICH I HAVE NOT ATTEMPTED TO DEDUCE ANY RULES FOR NONPERIODIC VARIATIONS IT IS MOST FORTUNATE THAT THROUGH ALL REPORTS THIS SERIES OF OBSERVATIONS CONTINUED UNBROKEN FOR SO MANY YEARS AND THAT IT DID NOT CEASE TILL THAT AT GREENWICH HAD BEEN IN OPERATION FOR TWO OR THREE YEARS THE NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS TREATED OF IN THIS PAPER EXCEEDS 200000 SPREAD NEARLY EQUALLY OVER SEVENTYNINE YEARS AND THE RESULTS GENERALLY ARE IMPORTANT ADDITIONS TO SCIENCE I CONSIDER THE DETERMINATION OF THE MEAN TEMPERATURE AT GREENWICH AS A REAL ADDITION IT IS PROBABLY THE BEST DETERMINATION OF THIS ELEMENT OF ANY SPOT ON THE GLOBE AND IT WILL HELP TO AN ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE MEAN TEMPERATURE OF ITS SUR FACE I MAY HOWEVER HERE REMARK THAT NONE OF THE MEAN RESULTS IN THIS PAPER COULD HAVE BEEN CALCULATED IF OBSERVATIONS AT EQUAL INTERVALS HAD NOT BEEN TAKEN THROUGHOUT THE TWENTYFOUR HOURS AND CONTINUED FOR A FEW YEARS THE OBSERVATIONS AT GREENWICH HAVE SUPPLIED THIS WANT IT WAS UPON THEM TAKEN FOR FIVE YEARS I BASED MY DETER MINATIONS OF CURVE OF HOURLY MEAN TEMPERATURE AND BY THIS MEANS HAVE MADE ALL THE OBSERVATIONS AVAILABLE AS IT IS DIFFICULT TO HAVE INSTRUMENTS READ MORE FREQUENTLY THAN TWICE OR THRICE IN A DAY YET TO MAKE THESE AVAILABLE IT IS NECESSARY THAT THE LAWS OF DIURNAL CHANGES OF TEMPERATURE BE KNOWN AND WHERE SUCH IS RIOT THE CASE AN EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE IN ALL COUNTRIES TO HAVE A SERIES OF HOURLY OR BIHOURLY OBSERVATIONS MADE FOR A FEW YEARS SO AS TO BE ABLE TO DEDUCE USEFUL RESULTS SUCH SERIES OF FREQUENT OBSERVATIONS NEED NOT BE MADE NEAR EACH OTHER AS IT IS FOUND THAT THE OBSERVATIONS MADE OVER A CON SIDERABLE EXTENT OF COUNTRY ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME GENERAL LAWS

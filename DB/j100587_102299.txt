THAT ISLAND,I206884,225 II A LETTER FROM SIR WILLIAM BEESTON GO VERNOUR OF JAMAICA TO MR CHARLES BER NARD CONTAINING SOME OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE BAROMETER AND OF A HOT BATH IN THAT ISLAND JAMAICA APRIL THE 8TH 1696 S I R BY THE RUBY MAN OF WAR IN DECEMBER LAST I GAVE YOU THE BEST ACCOUNT I COULD OF THE COMET THAT APPEARED HERE IN OCTOBER BUT THE WEATHER AT THAT TIME WAS OFTEN CLOUDY I HAD NO INSTRUMENTS NOR CELE STIAL GLOBE AND AM NOT PERFECTLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE SOUTHERN CONSTELLATIONS FOR WHICH REASONS THE RELATION WAS BUT INDIFFERENT NOW HAVING NO ACQUAINTANCE WITH ANY OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY I HAVE SOME OTHER REMARKS TO MAKE TO YOU WHICH I REFER TO YOU TO ACQUAINT SOME OF THEM WITH OR NOT AS YOU THINK IT MAY BE WORTH THEIR NOTICE WHEN I CAME FROM ENGLAND I CAUSED MY BAROMETER WHICH HAD WROUGHT VERY WELL IN ENGLAND SOME YEARS TO BE CAREFULLY PUT UP WITH INTENT TO TRY IF THE AIR HAD THE SAME EFFECT ON THE  HERE AS IN ENGLAND BUT BY SOME MISFORTUNE WHEN I CAME TO TAKE IT OUT MY TUBE WAS BROKEN AND I COULD NEVER PROCURE ANOTHER TILL ABOUT CHRISTMAS LAST THEN I MET WITH ONE OF 36 INCHES AND CLEANSED ALL MY FRAME AND THE TUBE VERY WELL PUT MY  THROUGH DOUBLE CLOTH AND MADE THAT FINE AND SET IT UP WITH ALL THE EXACTNESS I COULD WHEN IT WAS FIRST IN THE CISTERN THE  STOOD ONE DEGREE BELOW CHANGEABLE I DILIGENTLY OBSERVED IT EVERY DAY AND FOUND THAT IN THE MORNINGS BEFORE THE  AROSE IT WOULD BE THERE AND AS THE HEAT ENCREASED WITH THE DAY IT SUNK TO WITHIN ONE DE M M GREE226 GREE ABOVE RAIN THERE IT CONTINUED SEVERAL DAYS AND NEVER ALTERED ABOVE THREE DEGREES THO SOMETIMES FAIR SOMETIMESRAINAND SOMETIMES CLOUDY AND ONE MORNING LEAVING OPEN MY WINDOW AND THE  HAVING SOUTH DE CLINATION IT SHONE IN ON THE VISIBLE PART OF THE TUBE AND IN HALF AN HOUR IT SUNK 3 DEGREES WHICH I NEVER OB SERVED IT TO DO WITH HEAT IN ENGLAND I PRESENTLY SHUT THE WINDOW AND IN ONE HOUR IT AROSE AGAIN TO WITHIN ONE DEGREE OF CHANGEABLE AFTER IT HAD KEPT THIS COURSE IN SEVERAL WEATHERS FOR SIX WEEKS TOGETHER I BEGAN TO DOUBT IF IT WERE WELL ADJUSTED AND THEREFORE TOOK IT DOWN NEW FILLED THE TUBE TURND IT THREE OR FOUR TIMES UP AND DOWN TO LET OUT THE AIR AND PUT IT UP WITH GREAT CARE AND EVER SINCE IT CONTINUES THE SAME NEVER BY ONE DEGREE TO CHANGEABLENOR DOWN BY ONE DEGREE TO RAIN SO THAT THE WHOLE PROGRESS OF THE  IS BUT 310 OF AN INCH WHETHER THE AIR HERE BE SO MUCH HIGHER AND SO MUCH MORE CONSTANT FROM VICISSITUDES THEN IN COLDER CLIMATES I MUST LEAVE TO THE MAGI TO CONSIDER ANOTHER THING I HAVE TO TELL YOU IS THAT FOR MANY YEARS PAST IT HAS BEEN KNOWN THAT HERE IS A VERY HOT SPRING OF MINERAL WATER BUT BEING AN UNCOUTH WAY FOR ABOUT SIX MILES FROM ANY USUAL ROADS AND AMONGST HILLS WOODS AND ROCKS IT HAS NOT BEEN FREQUENTED BUT ACCIDENTALLY BY HUNTERS WHO ARE A LABORIOUS PEOPLE AND MAKE FEW REMARKS EVER SINCE I CAME HITHER I HAVE BEEN PROMPTING PEOPLE TO TRY IT BUT THE DISTANCE AND TROUBLE HAS HINDRED TILL THIS LAST MONTH TWO THE ONE VERY MUCH MACERATED WITH THE BELLYACH AND ANOTHER WITH THE POX AS IS SUPPOSED WENT TO IT CARRID CLOTHS BUILT A HUT TO KEEP THEM FROM THE RAIN AND SUN AND BOTH PRESENTLY BY DRINKING AND BATHING FOUND SUCH EASE THAT IN ABOUT TEN DAYS THEY RETURND PERFECTLY CURED IT COMES OUT OF A ROCK IN A FRESH CURRENT NEAR TO A FINE RIVULET OF GOOD COOL WA TER227 TER BUT IS SO HOT THEY ALL AFFIRM IT SOON BOYLS EGGS SOME SAY CRAWFISH CHICKENS AND EVEN A TURKEY BUT PERHAPS THIS LAST WANTS GOOD CONFIRMATION HOW EVER ITS CERTAIN THAT NEAR WHERE IT COMES FORTH THERE IS NO ENDURING ANY PART OF THE BODY BUT IT TAKES OFF THE SKIN IT CURES ULCERS AND CONTRACTED NERVES AND SI NEWS IN A FEW DAYS TO A MIRACLE COLONEL BECKFORD WHO WAS GIVEN OVER BY THE PHYSICIANS WITH PAINS IN HIS BOWELS VERY ACUTE THAT HAD WORN HIM OUT AND ANOTHER FOR THE VENERAL DISEASE AND ONE FOR THE BELLY ACH ARE NOW GONE UP AND PERHAPS BEFORE I SEAL THIS WE MAY HEAR FROM THEM AND IF IT CURES THEM IT MUST BE OF THAT VIRTUE AND EFFICACY THAT PERHAPS THERES NOT THE LIKE KNOWN IN THE WORLD WE ARE IN HOPES IT WILL ALSO DO FOR THE GOUT AND IF IT HAS ALL THESE QUALITIES IT WILL BRING THE SPANIARDS AND ALL THE NATIONS ABOUT US FOR CURE AND MAKE THE ISLAND FAMOUS IT HAS BEEN TRYD WITH GAULS IN MY SIGHT AND IT MAKES THE WATER IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS LOOK ONLY LIKE CANARY OR OLD HOCK BUT WE HAVE A FINE LARGE RIVER RUNS BY THE SIDES OF THIS TOWN WHICH SERVES ALL THE PEOPLE FOR DRINKING AND OTHER USES AND WAS BY THE SPANIARDS CALLD RIO COBRE OR THE COPPER RIVER THIS NOW OUR CU RIOSITY HAS LED US TO TRY WITH GAULS AND IN ONE NIGHT THE WATER TURNS TO A DEEP GREEN MORE ENCLINING TO BLACK DEEPER COLOURED THEN ANY EMERAULD I EVER SAW WHICH MAKES ME DOUBT THE COPPER MINES IN IT ARE NOT ENOUGH DIGESTEDAND THAT ITS UNWHOLSOMEBUT WERE THE  MORE REFINED AND EXCELLENT IT WOULD BE A SALUBRIOUS WA TER THIS WILL PUT US UPON TRYING MOST OF THE WATER WE DRINK OF IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IS ABUNDANCE OF SPRINGS AND RIVERS BUT I BELIEVE MOST OF THEM IMPREGNATED WITH SOME MINERAL OR OTHER M M 2 SIR228 SIRITS NOW THE 18TH OF APRILSINCE THAT ABOVE COL BECK FORD IS FINELY RECOVEREDAND THE OTHER ALMOST CURED OF HIS ULCERS SO THAT THE WATER IS BEYOND DOUBT AND MANY ARE RESORTING TO IT AND SINCE THAT TIME I HAVE TRYED SEVERAL WATERSPRINGS AND RIVERS HEREABOUTS AND FIND THEM ALL TINGD WITH SOME METAL OR OTHER MORE OR LESS SO THAT WE KNOW NOT THE RICHES THAT MAY BE IN THE EARTH NOR THE VALUE OF THE VEGETABLES AND ITS PITY SOME IN GENIOUS PEOPLE ARE NOT IMPLOYED TO ENQUIRE INTO THEM WHETHER THIS BE WORTH YOUR READING OR NO I KNOW NOT HOWEVER I PRAY YOU TO ACCEPT OF IT FROM YOURS C III

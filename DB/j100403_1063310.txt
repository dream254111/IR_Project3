intent there can be no will5 The Virginia case of McBride v McBride6 is cited as not being opposed to such a construction of the letter as a will but that case cites and affirms a dissenting opinion by Judge Cabell in Sharp v Sharp7 which reads A paper is not to be established as a mans will merely by prov ing that he intended to make a disposition of his property similar to or even identically the same with that contained in the paper It must satisfactorily appear that he intended the very paper to be his will This quotation undoubtedly condemns calling an instrument a will just because it may express what the testator would have done in his will had he made one but until he makes it then such wishes cannot be given effect That is the case at bar The soldier by his letters showed he wished his wife to have his property upon his death and thought she would get it by arrangements previously made but he never intended this letter to operate as a will or even to pass any property at his death He evidently thought he had formerly arranged the matter of his property The leniency of the courts towards the wills of active service men has directed its work rather to waiving technical formalities 8 than trying to construe as a will some writing that was not in tended as testamentary The animus testandi is a fundamental prerequisite and cannot be supplied by any other than the testator himself But when once shown it is well for the courts to show favor to soldiers and sailors by waiving formalities of execution However when our courts begin to construe as done anirmo testandi what is really not so done they may be doing justice in that par ticular case but they are laying down as a precedent something that will make even more chaotic our present law of wills with the re sult that the will chosen for a soldier by the courts may not be the instrument he actually made animo testandi While on this subject it may be interesting to read these two ar ticles Odd

for the first time arisen in Virginia An infant representing that he was of full age and having the appearance of full age executed a deed of trust which contract the defendant was induced to enter believing the infant to be of age Upon coming of age the infant brought an action in equity to have the contract set aside on the grounds of infancy Held Infant es topped to deny his infancy Since the decisions are not in accord on this question it may be of interest and of value to briefly note the conflicting doctrines and the reasons assigned for the various holdings In England the courts of equity almost universally hold in ac cord with the doctrine as laid down by the Virginia Court and de clare that an infant cannot take advantage of his own fraud2 In America there are two classes of cases where estoppel may arise The first as in the instant case where the infant is seeking to recover the property or reassert title and second where he sets up his infancy as a defense Where the infant seeks affirmative relief and goes into equity to have the contract set aside it is held by sounder reasoning based on equitable principles that the infant should be estopped when guilty of fraud This view is supported by the great weight of au thority8 But the contrary is held in a few jurisdictions the deci sions being based on the ground that one under the disability of minority has no power to remove the disability by a representation and that his representations cannot be of greater force than the contract itself4 In the second class of cases where the infant sets up his infancy as a defense the weight of authority holds that estoppel does not apply5 But some jurisdictions hold that even in this case that eq uitable estoppel can be invoked6 Although as will be seen there exists a conflict on this question it would seem that the doctrine as laid down by the Virginia Court of Appeals is more in accord with equity and good conscience and that the protection which the law affords an infant should not be used to perpetrate a fraud For as said by Judge Prentis in deliv ering the opinion of the Court in the instant case    we prefer to follow in this conflict in

court of eq uity to consummate such a fraud7 T S SALESRESERVATION OF TITLE RECORDED UNDER VIRGINIA CODE 1919 SECTION 5189SHIFTING STOCK OF GOODSBONA FIDE PUR CHASERThe following are the facts in the case of Rudolph v Farmers Supply Co 1 The plaintiff sold to private citizens not dealing in automobiles an automobile reserving title to secure the payment of notes given in consideration for the sale The memorandum of the contract was recorded in the clerks office as required by the Virginia Code 1919  5189 Later the purchasers sold the car to a dealer in sec ond hand automobiles to become a part of his shifting stock of goods The plaintiff had no knowledge that the car in question was in the hands of the dealer for sale and a part of his stock This dealer later sold it to a bona fide purchaser A bill was filed by the plaintiff to enforce its vendors lien Held Lien enforceable against the bona fide purchaser The general rule is well settled in Virginia that where a chattel mortgagee or owner stands by and permits a seller who is a li censed or recognized dealer in such goods to hold himself out to the world as owner treat the goods as his own place them with other similar goods in a public show room offer them indiscrimi nately for sale or do other acts which are inconsistent with the mortgage and tending to show complete ownership such mort gagee or owner is estopped to assert his ownership against a pur chaser for value without notice and such constructive notice as is furnished by due recordation is insufficient in these cases2 This is a well recognized exception to the doctrine that a vendor can transfer no better title than is vested in him3 When one considers the character of the sales and transactions of an ordinary retail merchant the necessity for this exception becomes apparent in or der to afford protection to the public and to prevent a paralysis of business In a recent case the Virginia Court decided that the bulk or value of the article mortgaged did not prevent the application of this exception4 The following extract from the opinion by Judge 7 Stallard v Sutherland supra Va 108 S E 638 1921 2 Addington v Etheridge 53 Va 436

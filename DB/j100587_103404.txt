BY THE REV MR DERHAM PREBENDARY OF WINDSOR F R S,I206896,121 XI AN ACCOUNT OF A LARGE QUANTITY OF ALCALIOUS SALT PRODUCED BY BURNING ROTTEN WOOD BY MR ROBIE OF  COLLEGE IN CAM BRIDGE NEWENGLAND COMMUNICATED BY THE REV MR DERHAM PREBENDARY OF WINDSOR F R S A WHITE OAK TREE ABOUT TWO FOOT DIAMETER IS IN CAMBRIDGE OF SO WONDERFUL A NATURE AS THAT ALTHOUGH ABOUT A THIRD OF IT WAS DECAYD AND SEEMD REALLY TO BE ROTTEN WOOD YET THIS DECAYD PART IN BURNING WOULD TURN ALMOST WHOLLY INTO A GOOD WHITE ALKALI AND IT WOULD RUN DOWN INTO HARD LUMPS WHITE AND CLEAN SUCH A LUMP WAS BROUGHT US AT COLLEGE TO KNOW WHAT IT WAS WE TASTED IT AND FOUND IT TO BE SALT AND VERY STRONG WE DISSOLVED IT IN CLEAN WATER AND UPON DECANTATION AND EVAPO RATION WITHOUT ANY FILTRATION WE PRODUCED A VERY CLEAN WHITE SALT EXCEEDING IN STRENGTH AND WHITENESS ANY TO BE BOUGHT AT THE SHOPS WE TRIED IT MANY OF THE WAYS OF PROVING THE GOODNESS OF AN ALKALI NOW AL THOUGH ALKALIS MAY BE EXTRACTED FROM COMMON ASHES YET WHAT WAS PECULIAR IN THIS IS 1 THAT WHILE IT WAS BURNING THE WOOD IT SELF WOULD MELT AND RUN DOWN INTO HARD LUMPS OF SALT AND NONE OF THE WOOD THAT WAS SOUND WOULD DO THIS BUT ONLY THAT WHICH WAS DECAYD AND WHAT WAS MOST DECAYD WOULD YIELD THE GREATEST QUANTITY OF SALT AND 2 WHEREAS122 2 WHEREAS ALL OTHER ALKALIS OF WOOD MADE THUS BY INCINERATION ARE BLACKISH AT FIRST AND A LIXIVIUM MADE OF THEM ALTHOUGH OFTEN FILTRED WILL YET BE TINGED WITH A BROWN COLOUR OCCASIONED FROM A KIND OF COAL OR ASHES SO INCLOSED OR CLOSELY UNITED TO THE ALKALI IN BURNING AS NOT EASILY TO BE SEPARATED BY FILTRATION THOUGH OFTEN REPEATED YET THIS ALKALI WAS VERY WHITE EVEN BEFORE SOLUTION AND WHEN DISSOLVED THE LIXIVIUM WAS NOT IN THE LEAST TINGED BUT CLEAR LIKE PURE WATER ONLY A VERY SMALL QUANTITY OF ASHES SUBSIDED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE VESSEL IN WHICH THE SOLUTION WAS MADE THE LIXIVIUM THENCE DECAN TED NEEDED NO FILTRATION BUT WHEN BOILED UP TO DRY NESS THE SALT REMAINED FINE AND WHITE AND 3 THAT IN THE BURNING OF THIS WOOD AS THE HEAT OF THE FIRE GREW MORE INTENSE THE WOOD DID AS IT WERE MELT AND CLODDER TOGETHER IN GREAT LUMPS AND DID VISIBLY BUBBLE AND BOIL WITH AN HISSING NOISE LIKE THE FRYING OF FAT IN A PAN 4 THAT WHEREAS THE WEIGHT OF THE ALKALISALT PRO DUCED FROM OTHER WOOD IN THE COMMON WAY OF IN CINERATION IS VERY INCONSIDERABLE IN PROPORTION TO THE WEIGHT OF THE WOOD PRODUCING IT YET THIS SALT NEARLY EQUALLED IN WEIGHT THE WOOD FROM WHENCE IT WAS TAKEN 5 WHEREAS THE ASHES OF OTHER WOOD ARE NEVER SO REPLETE WITH SALT AS THAT SALT CAN BE SEEN OR IN THE LEAST CAUSE THE ASHES TO LUMP OR CLODDER TOGETHER YET THIS THE WHOLE OF IT WOULD GATHER INTO HARD AND SOLID LUMPS OF WHITE SALT AS EASILY TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM ASHES THO WHITE AS THE PUREST SALT OF TARTAR MADE WITH NITRE WOULD BE 6 THAT ALTHOUGH FROM OTHER ROTTEN WOOD MUCH LESS OF AN ALKALI CAN BE PRODUCED THAN FROM SOUND WOOD YET HERE IT IS QUITE CONTRARY THE DECAYD PART OF THIS TREE123 TREE YIELDING IN QUANTITY AS AFORESAID AND THE OTHER OR SOUND PART YIELDING NO MORE THAN OTHER WOOD HAVING THUS GIVEN YOU A TRUE AND FULL ACCOUNT OF THIS STRANGE AND UNUSUAL PRODUCTION WE SHALL GIVE YOU OUR THOUGHTS RESPECTING THE SOLUTION OF IT WHICH WE SHOULD NOT ATTEMPT BUT THAT BEING ON THE SPOT WE HAVE EXAMINED THE TREE AND CONSIDERED WHAT BY THE MARKS FOUND ON IT HATH IN ALL PROBABILITY HAP PENED TO IT AND THEREFORE SUPPOSE OURSELVES IN SOME MEASURE CAPABLE OF GIVING AS TRUE OR TRUER JUDGMENT CONCERNING IT THAN WISER AND MORE INGENIOUS MEN CAN BE WHO HAVE NOT HAD THOSE ADVANTAGES ALL WHICH WE DO WITH HUMILITY AND MODESTY SUBMIT TO YOUR CENSURE AND WE WOULD FIRST PREMISE THAT THE TREE IN ALL PROBABILITY WAS STRUCK WITH LIGHTNING MANY YEARS SINCE IT BEING TORN FROM THE TOP OF ITS TRUNK TO THE BOTTOM ON THAT SIDE WHICH IS NOW DECAYD AND WHICH YIELDED THE AFORESAID SALT THERE BEING A CHAN NEL FROM TOP TO BOTTOM ABOUT FIVE INCHES WIDE AS WE SUPPOSE AT FIRST WHICH THE LENGTH OF TIME HAD CLOSED AND UNDER THIS BARK THE WOOD NEXT TO IT WAS BLACK WHICH WE SUPPOSE WAS CAUSED BY THE LIGHT NING FROM WHICH THINGS WE CONJECTURED THAT THE WOOD HA VING BEEN THUS EXPOSED TO THE AIR AND WATER FOR SO LONG A TIME THIS WAS THE OCCASION OF ITS BECOMING DEFECTIVE IN THAT PART AND THAT THE LIGHTNING HAVING PENETRATED THE WOOD HAD SO ALTERED AND DISPOSED THE PARTS AND PORES OF IT THE FIGURE AND TEXTURE OF THE PARTS APPEARING MUCH DIFFERENT FROM OTHER ROTTEN WOOD TO ATTRACT RECEIVE IN AND RETAIN THE NITROUS SALT OF THE AIR WHICH THROUGH SO LONG A SPACE OF TIME COULD NOT BUT BE IN GREAT ABUNDANCE EVEN AS SALT OF TARTAR OR OTHER ALKALIS BEING EXPOSED TO THE AIR FOR SOME CON SIDERABLE SPACE OF TIME WILL BE WHOLLY REDUCED TO A S NITROUS124 NITROUS SALT AS GLAUBER SAYS AND ITS QUANTITY ALSO IN CREASED VERY CONSIDERABLY NOT THAT THE LIGHTNING HAD SO CALCINED THE WOOD AS TO REDUCE IT TO A PERFECT SALT BUT YET BY PENETRATING OF IT IT HAD CALCINED IT IN SUCH MEASURE AS TO GIVE IT A LIKE PROPRIETY OR DISPO SITION OF ATTRACTING THE NITROUS SALT OF THE AIR AS AFORE SAID ALKALIS OF WOOD THAT HAVE BEEN FULLY CALCINED NOW IF IT SHOULD BE OBJECTED THAT THE NITRE IN THIS WOOD BEING VOLATILE WOULD FLEE AWAY IN THE BURNING OF THE WOOD WE ANSWER THAT ALTHOUGH NITRE CANT BE FIXED AND REDUCED TO AN ALKALISALT BY CALCINING IT PER SE YET IT MAY SO BY THE ADDITION OF THE POWDER OF CHARCOAL AS CHYMISTS TEACH US AND HERE WE SUP POSE THE WOOD SO ALTERED BY LIGHTNING IN WHICH THIS NITROUS SALT WAS LODGED AS SERVED INSTEAD OF COAL IN THE BURNING OF IT F I N I S L O N D O N PRINTED FOR W AND J INNYS

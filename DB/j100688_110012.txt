appearance which the blood sometimes assumes after its coagulation and which has been termed  buff has been referred by Mr Hewson to its increased tenuity and slow coagulation Dr Davy is inclined to ascribe the separation of the colouring matter from a part of the coagulum or diminished viscidity to the former rather than the latter cause for he has remarked that blood drawn in several inflammatory diseases coagulates with its usual rapidity and yet forms the buffy coat its specific gravity also rather exceeds than falls short of that of healthy blood Dr Davy next adverts to the opinion that the age of the morbid adhesions which on dissection are often found to connect together serous membranes is proportionate to their strength but as he has found strong adhesions formed in twentyfour hours between surfaces of the pleura in consequence of inflammation artificially excited and as he has remarked a peculiar tenacity in the coagulable lymph of the blood enabling it to be drawn out into bands and fibres which become solid and opake and thus represent ordinary adhesions he is inclined to doubt the correctness of the above opinion Lastly the author mentions the supposed pouring out of serous fluids into certain cavities after death and cites experiments to show that under ordinary circumstances no such effusion or exu dation of serum takes place On the Mechanism of the Spine By Henry Earle Esq FRS Surgeon to the Foundling and Assistant Surgeon to St Bartholo mews Hospital Read April 25 1822 Plhil Trans 1822 p 276 In examining the structure of the vertebrw in different animals the author was particularly struck with the mechanism of the spine and spinal canal in birds by which great motion is gained in the neck without injury to the spinal marrow The cervical vertebrme in birds vary from 9 to 24 in number they differ considerably from each other and are articulated by complex joints in some respects resem bling the articulation of the olecranon with the humerus in the human subject but admitting also of lateral motion The varying positions of the articulating surfaces are favoured by the interposition of a car tilage adapted to the surface of each bone and inclosed between reduplications of sinovial membrane each joint is thus double alnd resembles the articulation of the human lower jaw The canal of each vertebra is contracted in the centre and enlarges above and171 lbelow In front it is closed by the bodies of the vertebrae  but in the skeleton its posterior part is imperfect being filled up in the re cent state by membrane and protected by the ligamentum nuchae The author then describes the appearance on dissection of the membranes of the spinal marrow and of the mechanism by which its compression in the various and extensive motions of the neck is prevented he also adverts to the exact correspondence between the extent of motion permitted and the size and form of the canal in the human spine and to some pathological consequences connected with such structure Drawings of some of the cervical vertebrae in birds with a de scription of their different parts are annexed to this paper Of the Nerves which associate the Muscles of tlhe Chest in the ac tions of Breathing Speaking and Expression Being a Continuation of the Paper on the Structure and Functions of the NVerves By Charles Bell Esq Communicated by Sir Humphry Davy Bart LLD PRS Read May 2 1822 Phil Trans 1822 p 284 This paper forms the continuation of that printed in the last vo lume of the Societys Transactions by the same author In tho present communication the author proceeds to show that the office of the respiratory apparatus is not confined to the changes produced upon the blood but that the same actions are employed in subservi ence to other organs and that they perform a variety of functions as in the natural voice in articulate language and in the expression of passion as well as in the more familiar acts of smelling coughing sneezing c Having established the proofs of the necessity of a number of re mote parts being joined in the performance of these functions he proceeds to show that there is a distinct class of nerves for this pur pose That these nerves depart from the same column of the spinal marrow and diverge to all the parts of the frame which are drawn into consent in the action of respiration Proceeding to show the difference betwixt the calm and uniform breathing for the purposes of circulation and the excited and more irregular actions as in speaking singing coughing and sneezing he proves the necessity of certain powerful muscles being brought in as accessories and aids to the common muscles of respiration He nexts shows that the respiratory nerves are entirely distributed to these accessory muscles After tracing these nerves and disengaging them from their in tricate relation with the other nerves he proceeds by comparative anatomy and by experiments to show that they are respiratory nerves and that their division cuts off the parts to which they are respectively distributed from participating in the act of respiration He takes occasion to show that authors have attended too ex clusively to the par vagum or eighth pair of nerves which is only the principal or central nerve of an extensive class of nerves which

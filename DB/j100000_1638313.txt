over two million dollars Some of the states are exceedingly generous to their colleges and universities and in such cases the national governments contribution is only a small fraction of the total Illinois meets the governments 80000 with nearly two million dollars from state funds and there are several other states that are similarly liberal Most of the states give to higher education a greater sum than they receive from the United States government On the other hand a few states depend to a considerable extent upon Uncle Sams bounty The state of Delaware provided 22000 last year for Delaware Col lege to accompany the 70000 received from federal funds in Maryland the state itself furnished 36000 for the Agricultural Col lege against 80000 received from the federal government New

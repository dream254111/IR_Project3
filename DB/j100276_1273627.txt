employers of which the surety company had notice by which he was given ninety days in which to pay the sums embezzled which time had not expired when the prosecution was commenced In an action for malicious prosecution brought by the agent against the surety company the lower court ignored the evidence of extension of credit to the agent and instructed the jury that if they believed that the surety company was informed of the agents shortage by his employers there was probable cause for the prosecution Held that this omission was fatal error on the part of the lower court Boush v Fidelity and Deposit Company 1902  Va  42 S E Rep 877 The position of the court was that it is permissible for the court to instruct the jury that certain facts and circumstances if they exist are sufficient to constitute probable cause But it is not permissible for a court to submit the question of the existence or nonexistence of such facts and circumstances to a jury either upon a partial examination of them or upon a part only of the evidence relevant to the issue It is well settled that in the consideration of the question of probable cause in cases of this kind the province of the jury is to find the facts and of the court to say whether these ascertained facts con stitute probable cause But the manner in which the court is to bring the facts before the jury differs in various jurisdictions In some stales it is cus tomary to instruct the jury as to what is probable cause and allow them to decide whether or not probable cause existed Landa v Obert 45 Tex 539 Cole v Curtis 16 Minn 182 In Kansas the court is supposed to group the facts in its instructions and it has been held error when it did not do so A T  S F R R Co v Watson 37 Kans 773 In some jurisdictions the jury are given hypothetical statements of facts Bulkeley v Keteltas 6 N Y 384 and in others this is discouraged Ball v Rawles 93 Cal 222 MARRIAGECOMMON LAWPRESENT CONSENTThe contracting parties were joined by the sealing ceremony of the Morman church whereby they agreed and were declared by a duly authorized church official to be married for time and eternity The parties never lived together but secured a Morman church divorce Held that the ceremony created a valid marriage Hilton v Roylance 1902  Utah 69 Pac Rep 660 This case is of interest chiefly as emphasizing the position of the Michi gan courts upon this question In Lorimer v Lorimer 124 Mich 631 the court held that present consent was not sufficient to constitute a common law marriage but must be followed by cohabitation BISHOP MAR DI AND SEP  317 saysthe mutual present consent lawfully expressed makes a marriage what is called consummation adds nothing to its legal effect This is clearly in accord with the weight of authority in the United States Dumaresly v Fishly 10 Ky 3 A K Marshall 1198 368 Rose v Clark 8 Paige 574 State v Walker 36 Kan 297 Dickerson v Brown 49 Miss 357 Richard v Brehm 73 Pa 140 Hantz v Sealy 6 Binn 405 MASTER AND SERVANTASSUMPTION OF RISKNEGIECT OF STATUTORY DuTYPlaintiff was a coal miner in the employ of defendant company A statute of the state required all owners of coal mines to keep timbers in the mines sufficient to support the ceiling The supply had been exhausted and the plaintiff so informed the mine boss The boss replied that the timbers had been ordered and directed the plaintiff to continue work No immediate danger was apparent and the premises looked reasonably safe The plaintiff resumed work and shortly afterward was seriously injured by falling rock which would have been prevented by timbering the mine as the statute required Held that the assumption of risk as a defense could not be 414RECENT IMPORTANT DECISIONS pleaded since the defendant had violated a statutory duty and it mattered not that the plaintiff continued work knowing of the violation of the statute Green v Western American Co 1902  Wash  70 Pac Rep 310 The plaintiff should have recovered irrespective of statute under the com mon law ruleThat an employee who notifies the master of a defect in the place of work and remains in the employ relying upon a promise to repairs has a right of action if injury results from the defect while he is waiting for the repairs and has reasonable grounds to expect it The court however based its decision upon the principle that there can be no assumption of risk where there is a violation of statutory duty Upon this question there is little satis faction from the cases Most of them involve contributory negligence or arise under the Employers Liability Act and are therefore not directly in point The case of Na ramore v C C C  St Louis Ry Co 96 Fed Rep 298 37 C C A 499 48 L R A 68 is reliedupon and the reasoning of the court approved The theory is that the doctrine of assumption of risk rests upon contract express or implied Therefore the courts will not recognize or enforce as against the servant any agreement on his part to waive performance of a statutory duty of the master since to do so would defeat the object of the statute and be opposed to public policy In support of this view are Badde ley v Granville 19 Q B Div 423 Quackenbush v Wis  Minn Ry Co 62 Wis 111 Durant v Coal Mining Co 97 Mo 62 In the case of Grand v Ry Co 83 Mich 564 the court said Failure to comply with provisions of the statute would render the company liable had not the employee been guilty of contributory negligence MASTER AND SERVANTASSUMPTION OF RISKNEGLECT OF STATUTORY DUTYA city ordinance prohibited trains from running within the corporate limits at a speed exceeding six miles an hour The defendant company habit ually violated this ordinance Knowing of this violation a man entered its service as brakeman Seven months later while the train was running at a rate of speed in violation of the ordinance the brakeman was killed His representatives bring suit Held that the deceased assumed the risk of danger incident to the violation of the ordinance Martin v C R I  P R Co 1902  Iowa  91 N W Rep 1034 The court recognized that the negligence in this case consisted in the vio lation of an ordinance the primary purpose of which was to protect the public in the other case it was the violation of a statute enacted for the express pur pose of protecting the servant No importance is attached to this distinction Referring to the case of Narramore v C C C  St Louis Ry Co follow ed by the Washington case above mentioned the court contends that the assumption of risk is not purely a matter of contract in the ordinary sense of the term but a contract that arises not from any agreement of the parties but implied from the relationship of the parties and has none of the incidents of technical contracts Having undertalren work under certain conditions so long as the conditions remain unchanged no duty on the part of the mas ter has been omitted To say that the employee cannot waive the protection of the statute as against public policyis untenable This follows what seems to be the general rule in England and in Mass though in the latter places the cases arose under the Employers Liability Act Thomas v Quartermain 18 Q B Div 685 OMaley Gaslight Co 158 Mass 135 Goodridge v Wash Mills Co 160 Mass 234 also Fleming v St Paul Ry Co 27 Minn 111 6 N W 448 Knisley v Pratt 148 N Y 372 42 N E 986 32 L R A 367 Higgins Carpet Co v OKeefe 25 C C A 220 79 Fed Rep 900 It seems however that where the object of the statute is to protect the employee the rule followed in the Washington case above mentioned is the more prac tical as well as the more logical and satisfactory 415

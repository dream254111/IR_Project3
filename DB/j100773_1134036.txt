VERNIER AND WILLIAM G HALE FROM WILLIAM G HALE CONSTITUTIONAL LAW People v Jones 117 N E 417 Ill Intoxication at railroad station Hurds Rev Statutes 19 1516 c 38 par 539 providing for the punishment of any person who drinks intoxicants or who is intoxicated in or about any railroad station or platform is not violative of the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal Constitution or the Constitution of Illinois Art 2 sec 32 11 as establishing an arbitrary classification or the provision Art 4 sec 22 against the passage of local or special laws The Court cannot say that making a distinction between intoxication at railroad stations and elsewhere is arbitrary It was the judgment of the Legislature that there was a reason able distinction between the two The Court quotes from Missouri Kansas  Texas Ry Co v May 194 U S 267 as follows When a State Legis lature has declared that in its opinion policy requires a certain measure its action should not be disturbed by the courts under the Fourteenth Amend ment unless they can see clearly that there is no fair reason for the law that would not require with equal force its extension to others whom it leaves untouched    Great constitutional provisions must be administered with caution Some play must be allowed for the joints of the machine and it must be remembered that Legislatures are ultimate guardians of the liberties and welfare of the people in quite as great a degree as the courts DISPENSING DRUGS People v Hoyt 166 N Y S 953 Construction of statute Delivery of heroin by physician to patients agent The defendant a physician was convicted of violating the Public Health Law sec 246 as added by Laws 1914 c 363 and amended by Laws 1915 c 327 It was held in reversing the case 1 that the physician is not required by the law to examine his patient each time anew before supplying him with a narcotic drug as a medicine an examination within a reasonable time before being sufficient and 2 that it is not a violation of the law to deliver the drug to the patients agentin this case the patients wife DISORDERLY HOUSE Commonwealth v La Pointe 117 N E 345 Mass Construction of the statute The defendant was convicted of knowingly permitting a building under her control to be used for purposes of prostitution The complainant in the case had charged that the defendant did knowingly permit the building to be used for such purposes The Court instructed the jury that if the defendant rented the premises with knowledge that they were to be so used they might fiud the defendant guilty The statute under which the prosecution wasJUDICIAL DECISIONS   brought provided for the punishment of one who owns or controls a building and 1 knowingly lets it to be used for purposes of prostitution or 2 knowingly permits it to be so used or 3 after due notice of such use omits to eject the tenant Held that the instruction given was erroneous since it permitted conviction under the first provision of the statute whereas the defendant was charged specifically with the violation of the second pro vision The acts specified are separate and distinct and one does not include the other and by virtue of constitutional guaranties No subject shall be held to answer for any crime or offense until the same is fully and plainly sub stantially and formally described to him EVIDENCE Patterson v State 117 N E 169 Ohio Larceny of automobile Proof of other4 thefts Defendant was indicted for stealing the automobile of one W as the aider and abbetor of one X The evidence showed that defendant and X were cooperating in the business of stealing automobiles Testimony was given and objected to that they had also stolen the car of one C The objection was based on the ground that defendant had previously been tried and acquitted of the charge of stealing Cs car Held This evidence properly received The stealing of all the cars referred to including Cs car was part of a common scheme or plan Testimony concerning the theft of Cs car does not violate defendants right not to be put in jeopardy twice for the same offense LARCENY People v Bremreauer 116 N Y S 801 Possession Variance The defendant was a salesman for the Gurney BallBearing Company Before leaving the companys employ he took from the office certain valuable blue prints Upon an examination of the evidence it was held that the defendant at most had the custody of the prints while the possession was in the master and that where the defendant carried them away with felonious intent he had committed the crime of larceny at common law It was also held that since the indictment charged the defendant with common law larceny he could not be convicted of larceny by false pretenses or by embezzlement under the Penal Law sec 1290 MANSLAUGHTER People v Falkovitch 117 N E 398 Ill Involuntary manslaughter by reckless driving of an automobile The defendant was charged with unlawfully feloniously recklessly and negligently driving motorvehicle over the deceased The accident happened on one of the main thoroughfares of the City of Rock Island The rate of speed was stated to be 25 miles an hour Three grounds of error were alleged 1 That the lethal instrument was not described with sufficient definiteness 2 that the killing was not alleged to have been wilfull and 3 that there was a failure to set forth the specific acts relied upon as constituting the crime The judgment of conviction was affirmed The following points made in the decision are of interest a There are no words or special provisions of our statutes with reference to manslaughter either in the definition of the crime itself or elsewhere in the statute that 761762 JUDICIAL DECISIONS require that the indictment shall charge that the killing was both felonious and willful although it is common practice to employ both words in drawing indictments b Motor vehicle is a proper designation of an automobile The instrument of harm need not be more specifically described c It is provided by statute that No person shall drive a motor vehicle or motor bicycle upon any public highway in this State at a speed greater than is reasonable and proper having regard to the traffic and the use of the way or so as to endanger the life or limb or injure the property of any person It is further provided in the statute that a rate of speed in excess of 10 miles an hour in the business district or 15 miles in a residence district of a city or village shall be prima facie evidence of unreasonable speed It was error for the Court to instruct the jury that proof of a rate of speed in excess of that prescribed by statute would be proof of negligence since by the statute it is made only prima facie negligence But it was harm less error because it was otherwise made clear that the jury must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was running his automobile in reckless disregard of human life and that negligence to become criminal must be reckless wanton and of such a character as shows an utter disregard of the safety of others under circumstances likely to cause injury Moreover the facts in this case clearly support the verdict FROM C G VERNIER APPEAL People v Mooney Calif 167 Pac 696 Consideration of stipulated facts Under Const art 6 sec 4 limiting the Supreme Courts jurisdiction on appeal from the Superior Courts to questions of law alone where judgment of death has been rendered evidence discovered after appeal by the defendant from a conviction of murder cannot be considered by the Supreme Court Const art 6 sec 412 providing that the Supreme Court may not set aside a judgment or grant a new trial for any error of law unless after an examination of the entire cause    the Court shall be of the opinion that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarrage of justice further limits the power of the Supreme Court the words entire cause meaning only the cause as presented by the record Stipulations of the Attorney General with one appealing from a conviction of murder do not give this court authority to consider evidence discovered after the appeal or any matter outside the record ATTEMPT Cole v State Okla 166 Pac 1115 Is solicitation to commit adultery an attempt Mere solicitation to commit adultery cannot be prosecuted under the law as an attempt to commit adultery An information which charges only a solicitation to commit adultery does not state facts sufficient to constitute a public offense under he attempt statute Leverett v State Ga 93 S E 232 Attempt to manufacture intoxicating liquor a An instruction by the court authorizing the jury to find the accused 762 JUDICIAL DECISIONSJUDICIAL DECISIONS 763 guilty of an attempt to commit the crime of manufacturing alcoholic spirit uous malt and intoxicating liquors was proper b There was some testimony tending to show that the crime had been not only attempted but consummated but despite the inhibition of the Penal Code against a conviction of an attempt to commit an offense when it shall appear that the offense attempted was actually perpetrated by the defendant in pursuance of such attempt Penal Code of 1910 sec 19 and notwithstanding the evidence that a considerable quantity of whisky was found near the still which the accused was apparently attempting to operate the jury were not compelled to conclude that he had assisted in the manufacture of the completed product but was authorized to find that he was then attempt ing to manufacture intoxicants and may have entertained a reasonable doubt that he had been interested in the manufacture of the completed product dis covered or may have believed that he had but recently connected himself with the illicit enterprise and was attempting for the first time and with all the necessary equipment to engage in the manufacture of intoxicants CONSTITUTIONAL LAW State v Fabbri Wash 167 Pac 133 Prohibiting manufacture of liquor for personal use Laws 1915 p 3 sec 4 making an offense the manufacture of intoxicating liquor by any person solely for his own personal use is not violative of Const U S Amend 14 providing that no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States and that no state shall deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law etc or of Const Wash art 1 secs 3 and 7 providing that no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law and that no person shall be disturbed in his prvate affairs or his home invaded without authority of law Valdez v United States 37 Sup Ct Rep 725 Confronting with witnesses View of scene of crime An inspection of the scene of a homicide made by the trial judge in the presence of counsel for the accused but in the absence of the accused him self did not infringe the right to meet the witnesses face to face secured to an accused by the Act of July 1 1902 32 Stat at L 692 chap 1369 sec 5 enactng a Bill of Rights for the Philippine Islands where the judge in his inspection of the scene was not improperly addressed by anyone and did no more than visualize the testimony of the wtnesses Clarke J and White C J dissenting State v Owen Wash 166 Pac 793 Legalty of indictment under initia tive statute Whether amendment 7 to the state constitution providing for the initia tive and referendum is in violation of Const U S art 4 sec 4 guaranteeing to every state a republican form of government is a federal question and the federal Supreme Court has held the constitutional guaranty is a political matter beyond jurisdiction of courts The claim that amendment 7 to the state constitution is in violaton of Const U S art 4 sec 4 guaranteeing to every state a republican form of government has been foreclosed by Congress to which the matter is ex JUDICIAL DECISIONS 763764 JUDICIAL DECISIONS clusvely committed by admitting thereto senators and representatives of this state since the adoption of the amendment EXTRADITION In re Whittington Calif 167 Pac 404 Is one compelled to leave the state a fugitive One is not a fugitive from justice from the state of Texas so as to be subject to extradition thereto where having been arrested in that state for an offense there committed he was with permission of its authorities taken on process under extradition to the state of California there to answer to a charge of having committed a crime though the latter charge was later dismissed FALSE PRETENSES Knepper v People Colo 167 Pac 779 Note in hands of maker Other valuable thing Under Rev St 1908 sec 1849 providing that if any one knowingly and designedly by false pretenses obtains from any person any chose in action money goods or other valuable thing whatever with intent to defraud the offender shall be deemed a cheat and in view of sec 5540 defining per sonal property to include everything the subject of ownership whether tangible or intangible a note reduced to possession by a swindler is per sonal property and a thing of value even in the hands of the maker Garrigues J dissenting GRAND JURY People v Lensen Calif 167 Pac 406 May women serve on grand jury The word men as used in Code Civ Proc sec 190 defining a jury as a body of men and section 192 providing that a grand jury is a body of men did not include women notwithstanding Pen Code sec 7 providing that words used in the masculine gender include feminine hence an indictment presented by a grand jury of 11 men and 8 women prior to the amendments approved May 29 1917 St 1917 p 1282 was not found as prescibed in this Code within the meaning of Pen Code sec 995 providing that such indict ments be set aside IMMUNITY People v Fryer Calif 167 Pac 382 Construction of Immunity Statute Under Pen Code sec 1324 providing for immunity to a witness whose testimony may incriminate himself where defendant charged with murder had been called as a witness on preliminary examination of another and had been sworn and testified incriminating himself without a word of instruction as to his rights the statute not having been read to him defendant was there after immune from prosecution Angelloti C J and Lawlor and Lorigan J J dissenting The statute reads No    person shall be exempt from indictment presentment by information prosecution or punishment

evidence documentary or otherwise where such person so testifying or so producing evidence documentary or otherwise does so 764 JUDICIAL DECISIONSJUDICIAL DECISIONS 765 voluntarily or when such person so testifying or so    fails to ask to be excused from testifying or so producing evidence on the ground that his testimony or such evidence documentary or otherwise may incriminate him self but in all such cases the testimony or evidence documentary or other wise so given may be used in any criminal prosecution or proceeding against the person so testifying or producing such evidence documentary or other wise Any person shall be deemed to have asked to be excused from testify ing or producing evidence documentary or otherwise under this section un less before any testimony is given or evidence documentary or otherwise is produced by such a witness the judge foreman or other person presiding at such trial hearing proceeding or investigation shall distinctly read this sec tion of this code to such witness and the form of the objection by the wit ness shall be immaterial if he in substance makes objection that his testi mony or the production of such evidence documentary or otherwise may incriminate himself and he shall not be obliged to object to each question but one objection shall be sufficient to protect such witness from prosecution for any offense concerning which he may testify or for or on account of any transaction matter or thing concerning which he may testify or produce evi dence documentary or otherwise upon such trial hearing proceeding or investigation  INDICTMENT AND INFORMATION People v Griesheimer Calif 167 Pac 521 Failure to allege cause in charge of false pretenses Under Const art 6 sec 42 providing that no judgment shal be seta aside or new trial granted for error as to pleading unless the court is of the opinion thit it resulted in a miscarriage of justice an alleged defect in an information charging the crime of obtaining money by false pretenses in that it failed to show the causal connection between the pretense and the surrender of the money is not a ground for reversal Henshaw Melvin and Lorigan J J dissenting INSTRUCTIONS State v Turnage S Car 93 S E 182 Leaving community as ground for inferring guilt In a murder case leaving a community and fight are not synonymous words since flight is the evading of the course of justice by a mans volun tarily withdrawing himself and where a defendant left the community after a crime but denies that he was evading arrest flight or evasion of arrest is a question for the jury hence it was error to charge that an inference might be drawn against the defendant from the fact that he left the community Hydrick and Gage J J dissenting JUDICIAL DECISIONS

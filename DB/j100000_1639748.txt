distribu tion of plants and animals on the surface of the earth may be expressed The first is in terms of countries or provinces or their sub divisions To this there are several objec tions a The boundaries of a country or province or county are frequently very irregu lar and do not follow any definite direction These areas are moreover as a rule very un equal in size b The boundaries of countries which have a different form of government are unstable and are liable to change This has frequently happened already within the mem ory of men still living and is likely to happen again in the near future c The method is only applicable to land areas It can not be applied to the fauna and flora of the oceans Ihe second method is one which has not been much used so far but is much more scien tific and exact It is that of indicating the range of a plant or animal in terms of lati tude or longitude However important inter national boundaries may be from the human standpoint they have no meaning to plants and animalsunless indeed they should happen to coincide with some natural boundary such as a mountain range or an expanse of water But the parallels of latitude and the merid ians of longitude are so numerous that it is difficult to remember the particular countries traversed by any one of these in its course While most people know that the fortyninth parallel forms the northern boundary of the western half of the JUnited States very few indeed could name the states traversed by the fortieth parallel The method suggested here is a modifica tion of the second of the above It is proposed to divide the whole earths surface into a series of areas bounded by the parallels and merid ians Each ofthese areas will be more or less rectangular but only two of the four sides will be actually parallel The size of the areas will gradually diminish towards the poles but those within the same latitude will be of equal area Each  merosphere  will have a definite number attached to it and will be capable of division into smaller areas each of these ulti mate units measuring one degree of latitude by one degree of longitude The size of these proposed primary areas or merospheres as I have called them will be a matter for legit imate discussion If too small they will be so numerous as to have no advantage over the method of expressing distribution in terms of latitude and longitude If on the other hand they are too large they will be useless for indi cating distribution The actual size proposed here measures six degrees of latitude by nine degrees of longitude The reason for the adoption of these figures is twofold It is true in a general sense that isotherms or lines of equal mean temperature run for the most part east and west unless where deflected by mountain chains or sheets of water when they may run in any direction even north and south It is also true in a general sense that the temperature falls steadily from the limits of the tropical region towards the limits of the polar regions While there are wide varia tions in different continents I have taken the rate of fall as being on the average about 1 F for every parallel of latitude Six degrees of latitude will therefore correspond to about 9 F or 5 C If the width of the proposed areas were 6 of longitude instead of 9 these areas in the neighborhood of the equator would be approxi mately squares but would be narrow towards the poles By making the width of the pro posed areas 9 instead of 6 squares will occur about midway between the equator and poles and the number of areas or merospheres will be proportionately reduced The details of the proposed scheme are as follows Beginning at the equator the north ern half of the earth is divided into fifteen parallel belts each comprising 6 of latitude These are numbered consecutively from N 1 to N 15 The southern hemisphere is divided similarly into belts S 1 S 2 etc Each belt is divided into 40 divisions beginning at the meridian of Greenwich the numbers running consecutively westwards until the meridian of Greenwich is again reached As mentioned above each division comprises 9 of longitude 366 SCIENCESEPTEMBER 17 1915 The belt number can conveniently be distin guished from its division numbers by a dot placed between them Thus the state of Georgia would be included for the most part in N 610 with the extreme eastern area in N 69 The island of Tasmania would be comprised in S 717 and S 817 Subdivided in the above manner the United States would be comprised in belts N 5 to N 9 and would be contained in 29 divisions The abovedefined areas though large are sufficient to indicate in a general way the dis tribution of plants and animals But where greater exactitude is required as for example where it is desired to indicate the most south erly point reached by a typical northern spe cies or vice versa they are rather vague Ac cordingly each merosphere may be again divided into smaller areas each consisting of one degree of latitude and one degree of longi tude As will be seen from the annexed figure the east and west subbelts are numbered from 1 to 6 and the nine strips running north and south are marked from A to I By the com 90 81 36 l l  r     X  a 30 I r I H G F E D C B A FIG 1 bination of a number and letter the position of each of the 54 subdivisions can be indi cated thus N6105E will include the north west corner of Georgia One advantage pos sessed by the system of numbered areas herein described is that it can be used alone or in conjunction with the name of the state or province where fuller information is desired Thus Georgia N693I will indicate the area around Savannah Altogether this state con tains twentyfour of these smaller subdivisions If some such scheme of uniform subdivisions were adopted in the case of a flora which deals with a single state or country the sepa rate units of adjacent states or countries could readily be grouped into the larger areas men tioned It must of course be borne in mind that some such scheme as the above is intended to indicate only the geographical range of spe cies The division of the earths surface into biological provinces each with its characteris tic assemblage of plants and animals is a dif ferent matter Before we can divide the earth satisfactorily into biological areas we must know first the actual limits of distribution of each species as well as something of the clima tology in the widest sense of the proposed areas At present we have not amassed suffi cient data to enable us to make these wide generalizations though several persons have made the attempt with varying success The need for some such division of the earths surface as I have attempted to out line above is not so evident in the United States as it is further north Such terms as Labrador Alaska and Ontario referring as they do to very large areas are too indefinite to indicate with exactness the distribution of the fauna and flora Labrador formerly had a different meaning from what it has at pres ent the greater part of the territory formerly called by that name being now part of the province of Quebec and even yet the boundary line is not properly delimited The distribution of a certain species is given in the North American Flora as Nova Scotia to Georgia Tennessee and Michigan Presumably it occurs in Ontario as a line drawn from Nova Scotia to Michigan will pass through the province of Ontario But it is not by any means certain whether the species occurs in the southern parts of New Bruns wick or Quebec According to the method outlined above the distribution would be N69 10 N7810 N8810 Another species is mentioned as extending from Newfoundland to Florida Alabama and the Mackenzie As this river has a course of over 1000 miles in length it will be SCIENCE 367368 evident that it is a somewhat inde dary line To express the distribution of ar ought to be sufficient to enumerat ional numbers of the areas in whi and its ultimate limits to the nort and in an easterly and westerl Range of altitude in each divisior rate in each belt is of as much in range in latitude

done to further the ly species it interests of the abler students in their under e the divis graduate careers In using the phrase  abler ch it occurs students the subcommittee had in mind the h and south upper twenty to thirty per cent of the classes y direction In order to find out what was done in the a or at any various colleges and universities of the United iportance as States a circular was sent out to about forty which were considered representative of the J ADAMS various systems of instruction throughout the country This circular inquired what facilities were provided for the more able amongst the undergraduates for furnishing them with a ON FO F better and more rapid training than the ordi vIENCE nary student If such facilities were offered inquiry was made as to what form these IE SELECTION facilities took It was also asked whether any RESEARCH money rewards were given for high attain ttee of One ments and whether the institution had any ion of Scien knowledge of the results obtained from these hairman was facilities About thirty of the forty selected ittee on the institutions sent replies sufficiently detailed for 3nts for Re the subcommittee to obtain a fair idea of what d the follow was being done throughout the country in rper Colum this connection It appears that five univer arrison Yale sities have specially organized courses in tt Princeton which the

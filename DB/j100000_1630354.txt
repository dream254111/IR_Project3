now live both in Texas and in Mlontana it is hardly necessary to call in climatic changes to ac count for the facts In California there are extensive tracts of similarly appearing mounds vulgo hog wallows  in the San Joaquin valley but here not only can their winddrift origin be sub stantiated by ocular demonstration during any of the frequent sandstorms when the sage brush clumps are often left two feet above the general level because their roots resist the eroding action by holding the sand but the winddrift origin of the general soil surface can mostly be verified even when as fre quently happens the bushes thus left high and dry die out in the course of time and subsequent aqueous erosion increases the height and a gradual consolidation of the material occurs Hogwallows of quite different origin oc cur in Washington on the gravelly lands south of Tacoma city e g on Yelms prairie Here in the land of almost daily heavy rains during certain seasons water erosion has removed the sand and smaller gravel from variously shaped areas surrounding one or several larger blocks erratics the channels between ad jacent mounds being lined with cobbles left behind by the water Yet while the general aspect of the surface is similar to that of the hogwallows of California and the mounds of the Calcasieu prairie there is clearly no genetic relation between the three kinds of mounds however similar in their external conformation E W HILGARD BERKELEY CAL March 10 1905 PROGRESS IN THE STUDY OF THE KELEP THE existence of an efficient insect enemy of the boll weevil having been ascertained it became necessary to determine also the extent if any to which it could be utilized in the United States Since the last published re port on the subject many additional data  Report on the Habits of the Kelep Bull 49 Bureau of Entomology U S Department of Agri culture 1904 N S VOL XXI No 536 have accumulated but there are three fea tures worthy of special notice The Kelep in Western GuatemalaRecent letters from Mr W R Maxon report the ex istence of the kelep in the cotton fields of the Retalhuleu district of western Guatemala Mr Maxon has also sent to the Department of Agriculture seeds and dried bolls of an upland cotton of a variety evidently similar to that grown by the Kekchi Indians of Alta Vera Paz The three nectaries inside the bracts appear to be even larger than in the Kekchi cotton The pair of inner stipular bracts which subtend each of these nectaries are the largest yet known and have their margins fringed with long hairs as though to increase their efficiency in holding the nectar to attract the keleps inside the in volucre This west Guatemalan or socalled Pachon cotton is also an annual crop and is said to ripen in five months or in even less time than the Kekchi Following the analogy of other plants these varieties if they can be accli matized in the United States may be ex pected to mature in a still shorter period which gives them distinct agricultural in terest The effectiveness of the plan of miti gating the injuries of the boll weevil by cul tural means depends upon the shortening as far as possible of the growing season of the cotton plant Other things being equal a shortseason variety will also be an early variety of course but the simultaneous plant ing of quickgrowing varieties is likely to prove a better measure of protection than un certain and desultory early planting because the weevils are much more likely to perish by starvation after the weather is warm enough to bring them to the condition of activity than while they are kept by the cold in a torpid hibernating state It is thus not impossible that these shortseason varieties of cotton which are cultivated in Guatemala by the help of the kelep may prove to be of value in the United States even without their insect guard ians It may be repeated too that both of the dwarf kelepprotected varieties of Guate mala belong to the upland type and produce fiber of good length and qualitySCIENCE Breeding Habits of the KelepThe con tinued study of the kelep in Guatemala as well as in the United States makes it possible to outline the breeding habits of the insect which are in many respects different from those of the true ants and very much more suited to the purposes of domestication Pop ular language affords only the one word  ants for all the wingless social insects Even the termites are everywhere called wood ants or white ants though having no affinity or sim ilarity with the true ants apart from their social habits and the winglessness of the worker castes The kelep furnishes another chapter of the same kind of history It has apparently little or nothing to do with the true ants Its social economy does not follow the monarchical sys tem of the ants and termites but represents an entirely different system more like that of the honeybees in that new colonies are found ed by the subdivision of the workers of older communities instead of by solitary queens The keleps indeed have carried the principle of organization a step further than the bees for they do not depend upon the queen to lead the swarm but take her by the jaw and carry her over to the new burrow in case she fails to go voluntarily The new establish ment is also equipped with eggs and larvae brought over from the old so that the found ing of a new colony does not involve any inter ruption of the domestic activities This mobile organization of the keleps suggests to a slight extent the social habits of the nomadic driver ants and as with these the queens are sta tionary and probably never leave the nest ex cept when carried by the workers in migrating to the new home Males are to be found in the kelep nests throughout the year and cross fertilization is probably accomplished by the wandering of these from one to another of the closely adjacent not unfriendly communities The kelep queens have wings at first but prob ably never use them In some of the related genera the queens are quite wingless as among the drivers Ability to Withstand ColdA cold storage experiment made in Washington last August showed that the keleps would be able to with 553 stand low temperatures and the colonies which have been left in the Texas cotton fields through the winter have lived long enough to show that cold weather is not likely to be the insurmountable obstacle which will pre vent the establishment of this species in the United States Recent advices indicate however that none of the field colonies which have received no food or care of any kind since they were placed in the ground last July will survive to the cotton planting season A sufficient cause for this mortality is doubtless to be found in starvation though other contributing factors are apparent now that the social organ ization of the inisects is better understood The season has been as is well known one of unusual severity both in drought and cold The colonies were planted in the fields so late in the season that it seemed necessary to look for the dampest places in order to give them a fair chance to dig but this has exposed them to special danger from flooding which appears to have been the immediate cause of death in several instances and possibly in all The fields in the vicinity of Victoria where most of the colonies were located were completely and repeatedly denuded of their foliage flowers buds and young bolls by the leaf worms Al though the keleps readily captured and made use of these when the successive broods were in the larval condition and even broke into the pupae there were intervals when food was almost entirely lacking and even boll weevils became extremely scarce There are also two important social causes of demoralization The colonies were brought from Guatemala under the impression that the keleps were true ants and would be able to replenish themselves if the queens were se cured Our artificial nests were mostly very small no jars of suitable size being obtainable in that part of Guatemala The complement of workers was therefore usually very much below the normal It has since been learned by repeated observation that the keleps are like the honeybees in that the reduction of the colonies below the normal size induces dis couragement dejection and aberration of in stincts Neither did we take pains to include APRIL 7 1905554 SCIENCE with all the colonies eggs larvae and pupse The queens lay freely in captivity but a break in the normal succession of forms may be dis astrous because nurse duty is performed by the young lightcolored workers the preda ceous hunting instincts appearing with greater maturity The neglect of the young in some colonies and a frequent tendency to cannibal ism may be ascribed to this deficiency of keleps of proper age though even in colonies other wise normal some of the larvae are occasionally killed and fed to the others especially if there has been a deficiency of other animal food Detailed reports on the social organization and other features will be made but in the meantime it is apparent that a fair experiment to determine whether the kelep can maintain itself in the United States will require the planting of fullsized colonies early in the season and in sufficient numbers if possible to protect the field of cotton from the leaf worms as well as from the boll weevils That the kelep is not a true ant and that its habits differ so greatly from those of any other in sects previously known are facts that show how impracticable it would have been to de termine its possibilities in advance by the application of analogies drawn from insects of other families O F COOK NEW ORLEANS March 16 1905 QUOTATIONS THE SANITATION OF THE PANAMA CANAL ZONE DR CHARLES A L REED chairman of the legislative committee of the American Medical Association and lately president of this the representative organization of the medical pro fession throughout the United States a man capable in every way of forming just conclu sions and with the courage and capacity vig orously to express his convictions has at the request of the Secretary of War submitted a report of the sanitary or unsanitary condi tions in the Panama Canal Zone and in the towns of Panama and Colon placed by treaty under the management of the United States commission If the report of this gentleman is correct N S VOL XXI No 536 and it must be accepted as such until it is proved that he has made misstatements the sanitary department of the Panama commis sion has been in great measure paralyzed by circumlocution and red tape and the mis guided interference of those who have been placed in authority over the medical corps In certain quarters Dr Reeds report has been classified as frenzied literature but if one tenth of the criticisms which he has made were justified sanitary affairs on the Isthmus are in such deplorable shape that the presi dent should compel an immediate change in a disgraceful and dangerous situation There is but one commonsense solution of this problem and sooner or later it will be applied but the chief magistrate should not wait to take this matter in hand until the graveyards of Panama are filled with the vic tims of red tape As an illustration of the absurd methods employed Dr Reed says in substance that if the surgeon in charge of the Ancon Hospital makes a requisition for supplies it must go to the chief sanitary officer for approval then to the governor of the zone then to the chief dis bursing officer and thence to the commission at Washington It must there wait for ad vertised bids and when the award is made the requisition is filled under the supervision of a purchasing agent often not properly quali fied to select medical supplies The material is then shipped to the Isthmus the disbursing officer is notified he notifies Col Gorgas and he in turn must notify the surgeon in charge of the hospital who then applies to the quarter master for transportation and finally so much of the material as in the judgment of the governor and chief disbursing officer and the commission ought to be allowed to the superintendent arrives at the hospital There are cited numerous other instances of this ridiculous routine which in the light of a recent experience are a reflection upon the intelligence and conscience of the American people We refer to Cuba where Major Reed and Col Gorgas practically had carte blanche to do what in their judgment was best for the sanitation of Havana and

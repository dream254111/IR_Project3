should be addressed to the EDITOR at University Station Charlottesville Va BUSINESS communications to the PUB LISHERS IN Patterson v Crawford the opinion in which will be found else where in this number the court decides in accordance with the prin ciple established in Walker v Commonwealth 18 Gratt 13 that where a debtors property has been subjected for the payment of his debts but after sale the fund perishes while in the hands of the law by reason of the default of the officer in whose possession the fund is the debt is satisfied pro tanto and the loss falls upon the creditors It was further held without citation of authority that where there are priorities among the several creditors at whose suit the property is subjected and a portion of the fund is saved the same preference is to be observed as if there had been no lossin other words the loss must be borne in the inverse order of the priorities and equality is not equity in such case The decision seems right on principle We have a somewhat shadowy impression that a similar decision on the latter point has been made in Virginia but are unable to cite the case We shall be glad if some subscriber will send us the reference if there be such a case Hurst v Leckie found among the cases reported in full elsewhere was briefly commented upon in our December number Among other interesting questions discussed in the opinion the court deals at length with the question of the sufficiency of a certificate of acknowledgment which is irregular in certifying the official character of the officer making it The conclusion reached is that in Virginia since the adoption of the statute prescribing the form of such certificate the official character of the officer must appear on the face of the certifi cate and cannot be shown by parol But that such official character does sufficiently appear when the officer describes himself as a  com missioner in chancery for the city of Buena Vista in the State of Vir ginia  though he fail to state of what court he is commissionersincethe court judicially knows that there is but one court for that city the corporation court It would seem that even had the certificate been fatally defective and the registry of the deed of trust invalid the rights of the trustee and those claiming under the deed would have been superior to those of the attacking creditors at large so far as concerned the personal property in the actual possession of the trustee at the time of suit brought Though the deed be void for lack of registry the transac tion may still operate as a valid pledge of the personal property actu ally delivered to the trustee Clark v Ward 12 Gratt 440 Whether creditors who have no liens may attack a conveyance of the debtors property solely on the ground of such nonregistry is we believe an open question in this State Professor Minor expresses the opinion that an unregistered conveyance stands in this respect on the same footing as a fraudulent one and is therefore subject to attack by creditors at large 2 Minors Inst 4th ed 963964 Sed quere THE opinion in Marshall v Valley R Co which we publish in full is chiefly devoted to a discussion of facts and therefore calls for no special comment There is a single expression in the opinion to which attention is called lest it prove misleading In discussing the liability of the rail road company defendant for the condition of the temporary road con structed by it under permission of the county authorities the court says It is true that a traveller injured upon a public highway has in this State no right of action against the county authorities The court doubtless meant to say that the traveller had no cause of action against the countya proposition established in this State in Fry v Albemarle County 86 Va 195or the court used the expression county au thorities as representing the county in its corporate capacity It is believed that there has been no decision in this State upon the question whether a county official is or is not individually responsible for injury to a traveller caused by the negligence of the official It is generally held however that where the duties of the road overseer or other official are by statute specifically defined and he has the means or is able to procure them for carrying out those duties he is liable at the suit of private individuals for injuries arising from his official neglect Hoover v Barkhoof 44 N Y 113 County Comrs v Duckett 20 Md 468 83 Am Dec 557 and note collecting the authorities Robinson v Chamberlain 34 N Y 389 90 Am Dec 713 and note 1900 631 EDITORIALVIRGINIA LAW REGISTER THE decision of the Virginia Court of Appeals in Edmunds v Hobbie Piano Co published elsewhere in full is well worth the at tention of the bar The court for the first time construes that pro vision of section 2877 of the Code known as the Trading as Agent  statute declaring that if any person transact such business i e as a trader in his own name without any such addition as  agent factor and company etc all the property etc acquired or used in such business shall as to the creditors of any such person be liable for the debts of such personsave that this shall not apply to an auctioneer or commission merchant doing business under a license as such The ruling is that where goods are shipped to or left with an ordi nary trader not a regularly licensed auctioneer or commission mer chant to be sold for account of the owner such goods become at once subject to be seized on execution against the trader to whose possession they are entrusted And it may be added as clearly deducible from the statute that it is immaterial whether the creditors have knowledge of the real situation or not The decision seems to be clearly within both the letter and spirit of the statute The principle thus established while working a hardship in individual cases will serve a valuable purpose in defeating attempted frauds upon creditorsin one direction by preventing traders from securing false credit upon the show of assets not their own and in another by obviating fraudulent collusion between the trader who in fact owns the goods levied upon and third persons intervening as claimants in confederation with him Another ruling in the same case is that personal property hired to such a trader or left on storage with him is not  property acquired or used in such business and is therefore not liable to be taken for his debts WE observe from press reports of the proceedings of the Virginia legislature now in session that a bill has been introduced to repeal the existing law regulating admission to the bar and to restore the law to the miserable condition in which it was previous to the adoption of the present excellent regulations The existing statute has done so much for the advancement of the profession in this State and has met with such cordial and widespread endorsement from bench and bar that it is inconceivable that any intelligent lawyer in the legislature or out of it could bring himself to the support of such a measure as that now 632 Janproposed The present statute requiring candidates for admission to the bar to possess some acquaintance with the elementary principles of the lawand the judges of the Court of Appeals who constitute the exam ining board have rnver required moreis intended for the protection of the public against ignorant and corrupt attorneys and is not designed as uninformed laymen believe to limit the number of practitioners for the benefit of those already admitted No intelligent person lawyer or lay man will deny that the unscrupulous shyster ranks among the dan gerous elements in a community and it is no less true that the shyster is not the educated lawyerhe is the offspring of professional ignorance and an unenlightened conscience As the public school system is based upon the idea that the education of the people is the remedy for sup pression of crime for the cultivation of patriotism and the virtues that constitute good citizenship so in the narrower circle of professional life professional education is the safeguard against shysterism and its attendant evils of trickery and thievery in the ranks of the legal pro fession We do not believe such a bill as that proposed needs any opposition outside of the halls of the legislature itself but lest the nonprofessional members of that body be led into support of the measure by misunder standing the purpose and effect of present regulations members of the bar throughout the State should see to it at once that their local rep resentatives shall be fully informed on the subject THE case of N  W R Co v Stevens reported in full elsewhere establishes a new principle in Virginia in connection with the masters liability for the personal safety of his servant The present court has time and again affirmed the established rule that the cardinal duties of the master touching safe appliances a safe place to work competent fellowservants etc cannot be assigned to another sc as to relieve the master of liability for the omission or the negligent performance of such duties The principal case establishes a striking exception to this rule towit that these duties or at least that of providing proper appliances may be delegated to an independent contractor provided such delega tion is usual among those engaged in a similar business and due care has been exercised in employing a reputable contractor The decision is doubtless sound as applied to the particular facts But the principle is a dangerous one and should not be extended further If a railroad company may rid itself of liability to its servants in the matter of suffi 1900 633 EDITORIALVIRGINIA LAW REGISTER cient bridges by delegating the duty of erecting bridges to an inde pendent contractor why may it not likewise escape liability for the condition of its entire track and rolling stock by committing the care of these to an independent contractor  The answer would be as gath ered from the opinion that such duties as keeping the track in con dition and the inspection and repair of rolling stock are not ordinarily delegated to independent contractors while the erection of bridges is This may suggest to the present age of trusts and combinations that railroad companies may by convention extend the custom of employ ing independent contractors to the maintenance of the track and the inspection and repair of locomotives cars and appliances generally and thus escape any liability whatsoever for personal injuries to their employees due to insufficient appliances The established rule is that one cannot escape liability for neglect of a duty imposed upon him by law by delegating that duty to an inde pendent contractor This principle was strikingly enforced in the bal loon case Richmond etc St Railway Co v Moore 94 Va 493 where the present court held that if the independent contractor under took to perform a duty which the law imposed as a personal duty upon the employer the negligence of the contractor was the negligence of the employer If the defendant in that case had offered proof that it was customary for street railway companies when employing Teronauts to make balloon ascensions in parks under control of such companies to permit such reronauts to make ascensions in their own way as inde pendent contractors and had thus sought to escape the liability which the law exacts of those who invite others upon their premises doubt less the court would have listened with scant patience to such defense How the principle case is to be reconciled with the balloon case or precisely where the line is to be drawn between those duties which may be assigned to an independent contractor and those which may not it is not easy to affirm It is unfortunate that the court in the principal case did not go more deeply into this interesting and important ques tion It is probable that the true distinction is or should be this Where the particular duty is one which those engaged in business of that character do not ordinarily perform and are not ordinarily equipped to performas for example the original construction of appliances such as the building of locomotives and bridges which are generally furnished ready made by special manufacturing companies and are outside the operations of ordinary railroad companiesthen the con 634 Janstruction of such appliances may be delegated to independent con tractors and the railroad company if itself guilty of no negligence in the selection of the contractor or otherwise is not liable for the negligence of the contractor But where the duty is of such a char acter that its proper performance is within the resources of those en gaged in that business as ordinarily conductedsuch as the inspection and repair of track and rolling stock the selection and oversight of fellowservants the making and enforcement of proper rulesthen the duty cannot be delegated to an independent contractor so as to relieve the employer of liability for its negligent performance If a railroad company purchases a locomotive from a reputable man ufacturer and exercises due care in its selection no responsibility could attach to the company for the death of an engineer employed to operate it caused by the explosion of the boiler though due to negli gent construction The same result ought to follow though the loco motive were built by the manufacturer on the special order of the companyassuming of course that the only negligence proved be that of the manufacturers In each of these cases the railroad com pany has exercised the ordinary care required of it If this be so then equally free from negligence is the same company when it em ploys a reputable contractor to construct a bridge over which its trains are to run Yet it is apprehended that if as a part of the contract of purchase of the locomotive and of the erection of the bridge the contractor engages to properly inspect and keep them in repair during a particular period and a servant of the company is injured by reason of a neglect of this duty the principle thus established by the court would not re lieve the railroad company of liability It is to be hoped that when this question again comes before the court the doctrine will not only not be extended beyond the narrow confines of the actual decision in the principal case but that the court will announce some definite rule on the subject for the guidence of the bar and the trial courts 19001 EDITORIAL 635

J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,108513,OBSERVATIONS ON THE RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS OF INSECTS,I207010,139  V OBSERVATONS ON THE RESPIRATRY MOVEMENTS OF INSECTS BY THE LATE WILLIAM FREDERICK BARLOW FRGS ARRANGED AND COMMUNICATED FY JAMES PAGET FRS RECEIVED AUGUST 20READ NOVEMBER 16 1854 THE FOLLOWING ESSAY CONTAINS THE GREATER PART OF A SERIES OF OBSERVATIONS MADE BETWEEN 1845 AND 1850 BY ONE WHOSE RECENT DEATH DEPRIVED PHYSIOLOGY OF ONE OF ITS MOST EARNEST TRUTHLOVING STUDENTS THE PAPERS AS LEFT BY THEIR AUTHOR AND COMN MITTED TO ME BY HIS FATHER CONTAINED LITTLE MORE THAN A RECORD OF THE OBSERVATIONS I HAVE ARRANGED THEM TO ILLUSTRATE CERTAIN GENERAL FACTS AND HAVE ADDED SOME OF THE CONCLUSIONS WHICH THEY PLAINLY INDICATE I HAVE FELT THE MORE JUSTIFIED IN MAKING THESE ADDITIONS BY THE BELIEF THAT MY INTIMATE FRIENDSHIP WITH MR BARLOW WOULD ENABLE ME TO WRITE WHAT HE WOULD HAVE WRITTEN HAD HIS LIFE BEEN SPARED AND IN COMMUNICATING HIS RESEARCHES TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY I BELIEVE I AM FULFILLING THE DESIGN WITH WHICH NOT LONG BEFORE HIS DEATH HE WAS PREPARING THEM FOR PUBLICATIONJ P NATURAL RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS OF THE DRAGONFLY LIBELLULA FROM NEARLY ALL THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS IT MAY BE GATHERED THAT THESE MOVE MENTS CONSTANTLY VARY IN BOTH RATE AND FORCE VOLITION AND EMOTIONS CHANGES OF TEMPERATURE AND OF LIGHT ACCOUNT FOR MANY OF THESE DIFFERENCES AND IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN INFERRED THAT ON THESE DISTURBING CAUSES BEING REMOVED THERE WOULD BE A GREAT UNIFORMITY IN THE MODE OF BREATHING IF CARE WERE TAKEN THAT OBSERVATIONS SHOULD BE MADE WITH STRICT REGARD TO SAMENESS OF CIRCUMSTANCES IT IS NOT SO HOWEVER THE RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS BECOME MUCH MORE EQUAL BUT THEY ARE VERY FAR FROM MAINTAINING TRUE EQUALITY OF RATE AND FORCE EVEN WITHIN A SHORT GIVEN PERIOD THEY HAVE TIMES OF ACCELERATION AND OF DECREASE WHICH IT IS HARD TO ACCOUNT FOR WITHIN THREE OR FOUR MINUTES EVEN THEIR SPEED AND STRENGTH WILL VARY ALTHOUGH THE INSECT BE KEPT IN UNBROKEN QUIET AND IF DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS BE COMPARED IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT THE VIGOUR OF EACH INSECT OR THE PROBABLE LENGTH OF ITS LIFE CAN BE CAL CULATED BY THE FORCE OF THE RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS ONE OF MANY SIMILAR OBSERVATIONS MAY ILLUSTRATE THESE STATEMENTS EXPERIMENT I MAY 19 1848I WATCHED A DRAGONFLY LIBELLULA DEPRESSAY WHICH HAD BEEN CAUGHT THE DAY BEFORE JUST BEFORE ITS CAPTUPEIT WAS PURSUING ITS PREY AND FLYING VERY SWIFTLY IN ALL DIRECTIONS IN THE SUNSHINE THE TEMPERATURE WAS MODERATE AND THERE WAS A SLIGHT BREEZE STIRRING THE RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS CORRE SPONDED WITH THE ACTIVITY OF THE INSECT AND WERE VERY QUICK AND VIGOROUS I PLACED IT UNDER A GLASS AND NOTED ITS STATE ON THE FOLLOWING MNORNING TTHE INSECT HAD140 MR W F BARLOWS OBSERVATIONS ON THE BEEN FREE FROM ANY SOURCE OF DISTURBANCE THE ROOM WAS BUT FAINTLY LIGHTED THE TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR WAS 520 FAHR CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH WOULD HAVE LED ME TO ANTICIPATE THAT IT WOULD BE IN A VERY SLUGGISH CONDITION I FOUND IT COMPLETELY QUIET AND MAKING NO RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS WHICH WERE VISIBLE ON MY FIRST NOTING IT A TOUCH AROUSED IT SOMEWHAT AND IT BEGAN TO RESPIRE VISIBLY AND TO MOVE VOLUNTARILY FOR A TIME OR TWO BUT IT SOON SEEMED LIKE A THING HALF TORPID AND CEASED TO MOVE I CONTINUED TO OBSERVE ITAT ONE TIME IT MADE PLAIN RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS THEN THE FORCE OF THESE DIMINISHED AND THEY APPEARED TO CEASE AND THIS TRAIN OF CIRCUM STANCES WAS REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES ALTHOUGH GREAT CARE WAS TAKEN TO MAINTAIN UNCHANGED ALL THE EXTERNAL CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE INSECT WAS PLACED I AFTERWARDS PROCEEDED TO TRY THE EFFECTS OF MECHANICAL IRRITATION OF THE INSECT ON TOUCHING IT WITH A FEATHER BETWEEN THE POINTS WHERE THE WINGS ARE ATTACHED THE WINGS MOVED RAPIDLY SEVERAL TIMES I THINK IN AN INVOLUNTARY INANNER FOR I HAVE PRODUCED PRECISELY SUCH MOVEMENTS BY SIMILAR MEANS IN THE DECAPITATED DRAGON FLY AT THIS TIME THE RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS WERE LIVELY AND POWERFUL BUT THEY REMAINED SO FOR ONLY A FEW SECONDS I COUNTED ELEVEN IN A QUARTER OF A MINUTE BUT ONLY THREE OR FOUR VERY FEEBLE ONES IN THE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING HALFMINUTE THEN THEY BECAME A LITTLE ACCELERATED BUT WERE VERY SOON AGAIN IMPAIRED AND COULD NOT BE PERCEIVED ANY MORE FOR SOME TIME AN HOUR LATER I AGAIN WATCHED THE INSECT WHICH HAD BEEN KEPT COVERED WITH A GLASS BASIN SOMETIMES THE RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS WERE UNSEEN SOMETIMES THEY WERE VERY SLOW AND FEEBLE SOMETIMES THEY WERE QUICK AND STRONG THOUGH ALL THE WHILE THE INSECT DID NOT STIR THE INFLUENCE OF EXCITEMENT AND MENTAL EMOTION MENTIONED IN THIS OBSERVATION WAS AGAIN NOTED IN MANY OF THE FOLLOWING IN ALL CASES VOLUNTARY EFFORTS AND AGITA TION OF WHATEVER KIND PROVOKE THE RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS WHEN THEY ARE TOO FAINT TO BE OBSERVED AND ACCELERATE AND STRENGTHEN THEM WHEN THEY ARE ALREADY EVIDENT BUT THAT VARIATIONS OF THE MOVEMENTS ARE NOT WHOLLY DUE TO THOSE OF THE MENTAL STATE WILL APPEAR FROM THE EXPERIMENTS THAT SHOW SIMILAR VARIATIONS IN DECAPITATED INSECTS IN LIKE MANNER THE VARIATIONS IN THE RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS ACCORDING TO THE TEM PERATURE OF THE INSECT THE ACCELERATIONS WITH THE RISE AND THE RETARDATIONS WITH THE FALL OF TEMPERATURE MAY BE OBSERVED IN SOME MEASURE IN THOSE THAT ARE DECAPITATED INFLUENCE OF DECAPITATION ON THE RESPIR ATORY MOVEMENTS THE EFFECTS OF DECAPITATION INVOLVING THE REMOVAL OF THE SUPRA AND SUBCESOPHAGEAL GANGLIA THE ANALOGUES OF THE BRAIN AND MEDULLA OBLONGATA OF THE INSECT VARY ACCORDINGLY AS THE HEAD IS REMOVED BY A SHARP INSTRUMENT OR IS SUDDENLY CRUSHED IN THE LATTER CASE THE INFLUENCE OF  SHOCK IS ADDED TO THAT OF THE REMOVAL OF THE GANGLIA IN THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS THE HEAD WAS SEVERED WITH AS LITTLE VIOLENCE AS POSSIBLE EXP II SEPT 1 1845I TOOK A RECENTLY CAUGHT DRAGON FLY AND TWRICE COUNTEDRESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS OF INSECTS 141 ITS RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS THEY WERE AT THE RATE OF SIXTYFOUR IN A MINUTE I THEN SEPARATED THE HEAD OF THE INSECT WITH A SHARP KNIFE THERE ENSUED CONVULSIVE MOVE MENTS OF THE BODY AND GASPINGS OF THE HEAD THE RESPIRATIONS WERE FIFTY IN THE MINUTE BUT AFTER THE LAPSE OF FOUR MINUTES THEY WERE REDUCED TO THIRTYEIGHT AND AFTER FOUR MORE MINUTES TO THIRTYFIVE THE RESPIRATION WAS PERFORMED MORE FEEBLY THAN JUST AFTER THE HEADS REMOVAL AND IN TEN MINUTES IT WAS REDUCED TO THIRTYONE TIMES IN THE MINUTE DURING ALL THIS TIME THE INSECT WAS STILL UNLESS IT WAS TOUCHED THEN MOVEMENTS OF THE WINGS ENSUED FAECES WERE SPONTANEOUSLY PASSED I NOW LEFT THE INSECT AND ON RETURNING IN AN HOUR FOUND THE RESPIRATIONS IN NUM BER AS BEFORE AND QUITE AS POWERFUL IT LAY IN A TRANQUILLITY IN WHICH NO MOTIONS BUT THOSE OF ITS BREATHING COULD BE SEEN AND TO ONE UNOBSERVANT OF THE REMOVAL OF THE HEAD IT WOULD HAVE SEEMED AS IF SLEEPING FAECES WERE OCCASIONALLY PASSED FOUR HOURS LATER THE BREATHING WAS FEEBLER ITS NUMBER BEING THE SAME THE GASP1INGS OF THE SEPARATED HEAD WHEN IT WAS TOUCHED HAD LESS VIGOUR ON MY DRAWING A FEATHER LIGHTLY OVER THE SURFACE THE LEGS RETRACTED SLIGHT MOVEMENTS OF THE WINGS ALSO COULD BE THUS OCCASIONED FOURTEEN HOURS ELAPSED BEFORE I RENEWED MY OBSERVATIONS THE INSECT WAS NOW RESPIRINGAT THE RATE OF TWENTYSIX IN THE MINUTE REFLEX MOVEMENTS COULD BE YET EXCITED IN THE BODY BUT THE HEAD WAS QUIET IN SPITE OF STIMULUS IN SIX HOURS MORE THE RESPIRATORY MOVEMTIENTS WERE STILL TWENTYSIX AND REGULAR EIGHTEEN HOURS LATER THEY WERE STILL DISCERNIBLE THOUGH VERY FAINT EXP III OCT 2I COUNTED THE RESPIRATIONS OF A DRAGONFLY WHEN IT WAS TRAN QUIL AND FOUND THEM 1 08 IN THE MINUTE I REMOVED THE HEAD AND FOUND THEM FORTY TEN MINUTES AFTERWARDS THEY WERE FOURTEEN  THEY WERE QUITE EQUABLE AND CONTINUED AT THIS RATE FOR SOME TIME LONGER EXP IVTHE RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS OF ANOTHER INSECT WERE SIXTY ON THE HEAD BEING REMOVED THEY WERE TWENTYFIVE AND MOST REGULAR TEN MINUTES PASSED AND THEY WERE FIFTEEN  HALF AN HOUR LATER THEY WERE SEVENTEEN AND FEEBLER IN ANOTHER INSTANCE THEY WERE REDUCED ON DECAPITATION FROM SIXTYSIX TO TWENTYNINE THE FOREGOING EXPERIMENTS SHOW THAT THE EFFECT OF DECAPITATION IS ALWAYS TO DIMI NISH THE FREQUENCY OF THE RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS OF THE INSECT THEY ARE CONFIRMED BY THOSE WHICH FOLLOW BUT THESE PROVE OTHER FACTS ALSO AND FIRST THAT THE IRREGULA RITIES IN THE MODE AND RATE OF BREATHING WHICH ARE NOTED IN THE NATURAL RESPIRATION OF THE INSECT ARE EQUALLY OBSERVED AFTER DECAPITATION AND ARE THEREFORE NOT TO BE ASSIGNED TO THE WILL OR ANY MENTAL STATE EXP V ON A DAY WHEN THE TEMPERATURE WAS 590 FAHR I COUNTED THE RESPIRATIONS OF A CRICKET IN SEVERAL MINUTES WITH INTERVALS OF A QUARTER OF A MINUTE BETWEEN EACH TWO THEY WERE 84 106 79 64 59 90 ON THE HEAD BEING REMOVED THEY WERE 19 27 28 20 19 14 AND WERE LESS VIGOROUS EXP VIIN A TEMPERATURE OF 52 1PAHR THERESPIRATIONS OF ANOTHER WERE COUNTED LIKE THOSE OF THE LAST AND WERE 90 7073 72 A50 62 AND UNEQUAL IN FORCE AS WELL AS MDGCCLV X142 MR W F BARLOWS OBSERVATIONS ON THE IN RATE THE HEAD WAS REMOVED AND THEY BECAME 29 20 14 11 11 14 AND WERE CONSIDERABLY REDUCED IN FORCE IN ANOTHER INSECT THEY WERE REDUCED FROM 56 37 46 40 37 36 TO 20 14 12 11 9 6 EXP VIII COUNTED THE RESPIRATIONS OF A DRAGONFLY ELEVEN TIMES IN AS MANY MINUTES WITH INTERVALS OF A QUARTER OF A MINUTE BETWEEN EACH TWO THEY WERE 100 101 98 100 1 10 106 108 108 108 108 106 I THEN REMOVED THE HEAD AND NUM BERED THE RESPIRATIONS IN THE SAME MANNER AGAIN AND FOUND THEM 55 61 70 70 66 70 68 67 70 70 62 THEEVIDENCE OF ALL THE FOREGOING OBSERVATIONS PROVING THE DIMNINUTION IN BOTH RATE AND FORCE OF THE RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS WHEN THE HEAD IS REMOVED MAY SERVE TO ILLUSTRATE THE ADMITTED CORRESPONDENCE OF THE SUPRACESOPHAGEAL AND SUBCESOPHAGEAL GANGLIA OF THE INSECT WITH THE BRAIN AND MEDULLA OBLONGATA OF THE VERTEBRATE ANIMAL BUT THAT THESE MOVEMENTS SHOULD BE ONLY DIMINISHED AND SHOULD NOT CEASE AS THEY DO WHEN IN A VERTEBRATE ANIMAL THE MEDULLA OBLONGATA IS DESTROYEDTHIS MAY BE REGARDED AS INDICATING THAT THERE IS IN THE INSECT A MULTIPLICATION AND DIFFUSION OF THE NERVOUS CENTRES FOR THE RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS CORRESPONDING WITH THE PLAN OF MULTIPLICITY IN THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS TLHE SAME CONCLUSION MAY BE DERIVED FROM EXPERIMENTS WHICH WILL BE RELATED OF THE EFFECTS OF DIVIDING THE BODY INTO SEGMENTS INFLUENCE OF SHOCK ON THE RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS EXP VIII MAY 11 1848WISHING TO ASCERTAIN THE EFFECTS OF SHOCK UPON THE RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS I TOOK A DRAGONFLY LIBELLULA DEPRESSA WHICH HAD BEEN CAUGHT THE DAY BEFORE AND WAS BREATHING PRETTY VIGOROUSLY BETWEEN FORTY LAND FORTY FIVE TIMES IN THE MINUTE AND CRUSHED ITS HEAD COMPLETELY AND SUDDENLY THERE FOL LOWED PERFECT STILLNESS THE RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS WERE QUITE INDISCERNIBLE UNTIL BETWEEN THREE AND FOUR MINUTES HAD PASSED THEN THEY COULD BE JUST SEEN BUT THEY SOON CEASED AGAIN AFTER ABOUT FOUR MINUTES MORE HAD ELAPSED THE RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS WERE MARKED WITH RATHER MORE POWER AND PERSISTED BUT THEY WERE AS YET VERY FAINT AND UNEQUAL IN TWO HOURS THOUGH THEY CONTINUED THEY WERE STILL WITHOUT VIGOUR AND SO THEY REMAINED TWENTYFOUR HOURS LATER EXP IX MAY 13 1848 TEMPERATURE 64I TOOK A DRAGONFLY WHICH WAS BREATHING AT THE RATE OF THIRTYSIX AND CRUSHED THE HEAD AND UPPER PART OF THE THORAX THE RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS CEASED BUT IN LESS THAN A MINUTE WERE RESUMED THEY WERE HOWEVER VERY FEEBLE AND SO REMAINED IN ABOUT EIGHT MINUTES FROM THE INFLICTION OF THE SHOCK THE MOVEMENTS WERE AT THE RATE OF THIRTYNINE BUT THEIR POWER WAS EXCEEDINGLY DIMINISHED AND THEY REQUIRED MINUTE WATCHING TO OBSERVE THEM PROPERLY EVP XI CRUSHED THE BEAD AND THORAX OF A DRAGONFLY THE RESPIRATORY MOVE MENTS CEASED FOR TWO MINUTES AT THE SAME TIME ANOTHER WHILE IN FULL ACTIVITY WAS STRUCK A SHARP BLOW WHICH INFLICTED A LIKE INJURY THE RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS STOAPPED INSTANTLY WERE SUSPENDED FOR MANY MINUTES AND NEVER RECOVERED ANY DEGREE OF POWERRESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS OF INSECTS 143 EXP XI MAY 22TO ANOTHER DRAGONFLY WHOSE RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS WERE SIMILARLY FEEBLE AFTER RECOVERING FROM THE SHOCK OF CRUSHING THE HEAD I APPLIED STIMULUS BY HOLDING IT OVER WATER OF THE TEMPERATURE OF 1850 FAHR AND THE STRENGTH AND FREQUENCY OF THE MOVEMENTS WERE GREATLY INCREASED EXP XIIIN A DRAGONFLY WHICH HAD BEEN DECAPITATED AND WAS BREATHING DISTINCTLY AT THE RATE OF SIXTYTHREE I CRUSHED THE LAST TWO ABDOMINAL SEGMENTS FOR A MINUTE AND AL HALF THE RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS WERE BUT DIMLY VISIBLE THEN THEY REVIVED GRADUALLY THIS SHOWS THE RETROGRADE INFLUENCE OF SHOCK THESE EXPERIMENTS WHILE THEY CONFIRM THOSE WHICH ILLUSTRATE THE INFLUENCE OF MERE DECAPITATION PROVE ALSO THAT THE INFLUENCE OF SHOCK I E OF SUDDEN VIOLENT DESTRUCTION OF A PART IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME IN THE INSECT AS IN THE VERTEBRATE ANIMAL THEY SHOW THAT THE SEPARATION AND EVIDENT DISTINCTNESS OF NERVOUS CENTRES DO NOT SO DISSOCIATE THE PARTS WITH WHICH THEY ARE SEVERALLY CONNECTED AS TO PLACE ANY OF THEM BEYOND THE INFLUENCE OF THE INJURIES INFLICTED ON THE REST AND YET WHILE THESE EFFECTS OF SHOCK MAY PROVE THE MUTUAL RELATIONS OF THE SEVERAL GANGLIA THE FOLLOWING EXPERIT MENTS ON THE DIVISION OF THE BODY INTO SEGMENTS MAY SHOW HOW EACH GANGLION IS THE CENTRE FOR THE RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS OF ITS OWN SEGMENTS RESPIRATION IN THE SEPARATE SEGMENTS OF THE INSECT EXP XIII SEPT 7 1845I DECAPITATED A DRAGONFLY WHICH WAS BREATHING VIGOR BUSLY AT THE RATE OF FIFTYFIVE IN A MINUTE IN FIVE MINUTES THE RESPIRATORY MOVE MENTS WERE FORTYTWO AND CONSIDERABLY LESS FORCIBLE THAN BEFORE THE DECAPITATION EIGHT MINUTES LATER THEY WERE THIRTYNINE I NOW DIVIDED THE ABDOMEN OF THE INSECT INTO THREE SEGMENTS WITH CARE TO PRODUCE AS LITTLE SHOCK AS POSSIBLE AT FIRST I COULD DISCERN RESPIRATORY CONTRACTIONS IN THAT DIVISION ALONE WHICH WAS ATTACHED TO THE THORAX AND I WAITED AS LONG AS SEVEN MINUTES BEFORE I COULD DISTINGUISH THEM IN THE REMAINING SEGMENTS AND NOW IN ALL THEY WERE VERY WEAK IN COMPARISON WITH THOSE IN THE THORAX AND STILL MORE SO IN COMPARISON WITH WHAT HAD BEEN NOTED IN THE PER FECT INSECT HAD THIS BEEN OWING TO SHOCK THEY WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN RESTORED BUT TWENTY MINUTES LATER THEY WERE STILL INDISTINCT AND AT TIMES IMPERCEPTIBLE THE SUPERIOR DIVISION CONTINUED TO RESPIRE BY FAR THE MOST STRONGLY ON PLACING THE MIDDLE SEGMENT IN MY HAND THE MOVEMENTS BECAME IN ABOUT A MINUTE VERY DISTINCT AND INCREASED TO THE RATE OF 100 IN THE MINUTE BUT ON REPLACING IT ON THE TABLE THEY BECAME AGAIN OBSCURE AND SOON IMPERCEPTIBLE THREE HOURS AFTER THE OPERA TION NO RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS WERE OBSERVABLE NOR COULD ANY BE EXCITED THOUGH THE LEGS OF THE INSECT COULD BE EXCITED TO RETRACTION EXP XIV OCT 14 1845I TOOK A SMALL DRAGONFLY WHICH WAS BREATHING POWER FULLV AT THE RATE OF 116 PER MINUTE THE MOVEMENTS BEING POSSIBLY QUICKENEDBY EMOTION ON REMOVING THE HEAD THEY WERE DIMINISHED IN ONE MINUTE TO FIFTYEIGHT JUST HALF THE FORMER FREQUENCY AND WERE MUCH WEAKER I DIVIDED THE ABDOMEN INTO TWO EQUAL PARTS THE RESPIRATORY ACTIONS CEASED AWHILE BUT THE EFFECTS OF THE144 MR W F BARLOWS OBSERVATIONS ON THE SHOCK BEGINNING TO SUBSIDE THEY BECAME APPARENT IN TEN MINUTES THEY WERE MORE FEEBLE BUT PLAIN AND COULD BE OBSERVED IN BOTH DIVISIONS I COULD NOT SUCCEED IN COUNTING THOSE IN THE UPPER HALF BUT FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER THEY WERE FIFTY IN THE LOWER HALF TWO HOURS AND A HALF AFTER THE SEGMENTATION THE RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS WERE STILL VISIBLE EXP XV OCT 14I COUNTED THE RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS OF A DRAGONFLY OF THE SAME KIND AND SIZE AS THE LAST THEY WERE ONLY SIXTY AND THE DIFFERENCE IS CURIOUS FOR THE TWO INSECTS WERE CAUGHT TOGETHER AND EXAMINED IN THE SAME MANNER AND IN THE SAME HOUR ON REMOVING THE HEAD THE RESPIRATIONS WERE REDUCED TO FORTY AND BECAME MUCH LESS DISTINCT THE ABDOMEN WAS BISECTED AND THE RESPIRATORY MOVE MENTS CEASED IN IT IN TEN MINUTES THEY WERE RENEWED BUT MOST FAINTLY AND SLOWLY AND IN THE LOWER HALF ALONE ON BREATHING ON THE UPPER HALF IT CONTRACTED LANGUIDLY FOR A FEW MOMENTS AND THEN BECAME MOTIONLESS AGAIN EXP XVI JUNE 29 1846AT A QUARTER BEFORE 2 PM I ASCERTAINED THE RESPIRATIONS OF A DRAGONFLY WHILE IT WAS CALM AND AT REST TO BE THIRTYTWO THEN I REMOVED THE HEAD AND INVOLUNTARY MOVEMENTS OF THE BODY WINGS AND LEGS WERE NOTICED WHICH IN A LITTLE WHILE CEASED BUT WERE RENEWED AT PLEASURE BY EXCITATION IN FIVE MINUTES THE RESPIRATIONS WERE REDUCED TO TWENTYEIGHT AND WERE LESS POWERFUL THE ABDOMEN WAS NOW DIVIDED INTO THREE EQUAL PARTS TWO COMPLETE SEGMENTS BEING IN EACH THE RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS WERE WELLMARKED IN BOTH THE UPPER DIVISIONS MOST STRONGLY IN THE UPPERMOST IN THE LOWEST OR CAUDAL DIVISION THEY WERE NOT OB SERVABLE IN THE UPPERMOST DIVISION OF THE ABDOMEN THE RESPIRATIONS WERE AT THE RATE OF THIRTYTWO IN THE MIDDLE DIVISION AT THE RATE OF FORTYEIGHT IN THE MINUTE IN THE CAUDAL DIVISION THEY WERE NOT EXCITED EVEN BY BREATHING ON IT AT HALFPAST TWO THE RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS IN THE PARTS OF THE ABDOMEN WERE FEEBLER IN THETHORACIC DIVISION THEY WERE STILL TWENTYEIGHT IN THE MIDDLE DIVISION FIFTYTWO AT HALFPAST THREE THE ONLY RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS DISCERNIBLE WERE THOSE OF THE UPPER DIVISION BUT THEY WERE MUCH WEAKER AND ONLY TWENTYFOUR POWERFUL RESPIRATORY CONTRACTIONS WERE EXCITED BY VERY LIGHTLY DRAWING A SHARP POINT DOWN THE DARK MESIAL LINE OF THE ABDOMEN AND AN INCURVATION OF THE BODY AND A PECULIAR MROVEMENT OF THE LEGS TOWARDS THE PART IRRITATED WERE OBSERVED AT A QUARTER PAST SEVEN THE RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS HAD CEASED BUT WERE RENEWED THOUGH FAINTLY BY BREATHING ON THE UPPER DIVISIONS OF THE ABDOMEN IT WAS NOT EASY TO SAY WHY THE CAUDAL DIVISION DID NOT RESPIRE FOR ITS EXCITOMOTORY POWER WAS NOT EXTINGUISHED IT COULD BE EXCITED TO MOTION AND FIECES WERE EXPELLED BY IT EXP XVIITHE SUBJECT OF THIS EXPERIMENT WAS A LIVELY DRAGONFLY WHICH BREATHED AT THE RATE OF THIRTYFIVE THE HEAD WAS REMOVED AND THE RESPIRATIONS WHICH DID NOT PAUSE PERCEPTIBLY WERE FORTYTWO IN FIVE MLINUTES THE RESPIRATIONS BEING AT THE SAME FREQUENCY THE ABDOMEN WAS DIVIDED INTO THREE NEARLY EQUAL PARTS THE CAUDAL DIVISION BREATHED POWERFULLY THE THORACIC FEEBLY THE MIDDLE ONE NOT AT ALL I PLACEDL THIS MOTIONLESS PART IN MY HLAND IN TEN MINUTES IT REVIVED AND BREATHED ATRESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS OF INSECTS 145 THE RATE OF FORTYEIGHT IT WAS LAID ON THE TABLE AND IN TEN MINUTES IT CEASED TO RESPIRE IN THE OTHER SEGMENTS THE BREATHING WENT ON LANGUIDLY AND SOON CEASED ENTIRELY THE FOREGOING EXPERIMENTS ON THE EFFECTS OF DIVIDING THE ABDOMEN OF THE INSECT ARE CONFIRMED IN THEIR EVIDENCE OF THE SEVERAL GANGLIA BEING THE CENTRES EACH IN ITS OWN SEGMENT OF THE RESPIRATORY AS WELL AS OF OTHER INVOLUNTARY MOVEMENTS BY SOME THAT SHOW THE INFLUENCE OF CHLOROFORMS AND ETHER HAVING ASCERTAINED THAT THE COMPLETE IMMERSION OF INSECTS IN THE VAPOUR OF CHLO ROFORM OR SUILPHURIC ETHER QUICKLY SUSPENDS THE POWER OF VOLUNTARY AND THEN OF THE RESPIRATORY AND OTHER INVOLUNTARY MOVEMENTS I WISHED TO LEARN THE INFLUENCE OF THESE LIQUIDS APPLIED IN A MORE LIMITED MANNER EXP XVIIIIN A DRAGONFLY LIBELLULA VULGATA WHICH WAS RESPIRING VIGOROUSLY I COMPLETELY SUSPENDED THE RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS BY MOISTENING THE UNDER SURFACE OF THE ABDOMEN WITH A CAMELSHAIR BRUSH DIPPED IN CHLOROFORM THE INSECT REMAINED QUITE LIVELY AND THOUGH SO MUCH OF ITS RESPIRATORY MOVEMENT WAS THUS CHECKED YET NO DIFFERENCE COULD BE OBSERVED IN THE STRENGTH OR ACTIVITY OF ITS VOLUNTARY ACTIONS IN ANOTHER I SUSPENDED THE ABDOMINAL RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS BY A SIMILAR APPLICA TION OF CHLOROFORM BUT IT WAS SO LITTLE AFFECTED IN ITS GENERAL MOTOR POWER THAT IT TOOK FLIGHT ON BEING RELEASED FROM THE HAND IN ANOTHER I SUSPENDED THE RESPIRATORY MOTION OF THE TWO UPPER SEGMENTS OF I THE ABDOMEN BY APPLYING CHLOROFORM TO THEM ALONE THE OTHER SEGMENTS REMAINED IN ACTION TILL BY SIMILARLY MOISTENING THEM SEGMENT AFTER SEGMENT I GRADUALLY STAYED THE ACTION OF THEM ALL THESE EFFECTS WERE NOT DUE TO THE TRACHEE BEING FILLED WITH LIQUID NONE LIKE THEM WERE PRODUCED BY IMMERSING DRAGONFLIES IN WATER FOR IN THIS LIQUID THE RESPI RATORY MOVEMENTS CONTINUE VIGOROUS AND ARE ACCELERATED WHEN THE WATER IS OF HIGH TEMPERATURE ON THE OTHER HAND THE SAME SUSPENSION OF RESPIRATORY MNOTIONENSUES WHEN ONLY THE VAPOUR OF CHLOROFORM IS LOCALLY APPLIED I PUT ABOUT FIVE DROPS OF CHLOROFORM INTO A GLASS BOTTLE AND TIED A PIECE OF WHITE LEATHER TIGHTLY OVERIT AND THEN THROUGH A SMALL HOLE IN THE LEATHER I PASSED ONLY THE ABDOMEN OF THE INSECT INTO THE BOTTLE WHEN IN A MINUTE I WITHDREW IT THE RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS HAD ALTOGETHER CEASED BUT THE INSECT REMAINED CONSCIOUS AND COULD BE READILY EXCITED PRESENTING THEN THE CURIOUS SPECTACLE OF THE LEGS AND WINGS QUICKLY MOVING WHILE NOT A BREATHING MOVEMENT COULD BE SEEN IN A FEW MINUTES VERY SLIGHT RESPIRATORY ACTIONS BECAME VISIBLE AND THEY WERE GRADUALLY RESTORED TO NEARLY THEIR FORMER RATE AND POWER I THEN REPEATED THE EXPERIMENT WITH THE SAME RESULT IT MIGHT BE CERTAINLY ANTICIPATED FROM THESE EXPERIMENTS THAT DESTRUCTION OF ALL THE GANGLIA WOULD ABOLISH ALL RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS BUT IT SEEMED RIGHT TO DETER MINE THE POINT BY EXPERIMENT EXP XIXI DECAPITATED A DRAGONFLY LIBELLULA VULGATA THERE WERE STILL VIGOROUS RESPIRATORY MNOVEMENTS THIRTY IN THE MINUTES AND THE MOST LIVELY REFLEX ACTIONS WRERE146 MR W F BARLOWS OBSERVATIONS ON THE PRODUCED BY MECHANICAL IRRITATION ESPECIALLY BY IRRITATING THE LAST SEGMENT OF THE ABDOMEN OI CUT OFF THIS SEGMENT AND THEN INTRODUCED A LONG PIN WHICH I MOVED UP AND DOWN CAUTIOUSLY WITH THE VIEW OF DESTROYING THE GANGLIA TAKING CARE NOT TO INJURE THE ABDOMINAL WALLS THE RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS CEASED ENTIRELY AND WERE NOT RENEWED IT BECAME IMPOSSIBLE ALSO TO OCCASION REFLEX ACTIONS BY IRRITATING THE ABDOMEN THIS EXPERIMENT I LEAVE TWICE REPEATED WITH THIE SAME RESULTS INFLUENCE OF TEMPERATURE AND GALVANISM ON THE RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS THE RESPIRATIONS OF THE DRAGONFLY PRESENT THE SAME VARIATIONS IN VIGOUR AS DO THE OTHER MOVEMENTS AND THE WHOLE APPARENT LIFE ACCORDING TO THE TEMPERATURE OF THE MEDIUM IN WHICH IT IS PLACED A KIND OF SLEEP OVERCOMES THE INSECT IN THE COLD NIGHTS OF AUTUMN AFTER WHICH IT IS FOUND NUMB AND MOTIONLESS UPON HEDGES APPEAR ING AS IF DEAD BUT EASILY REVIVED BY THE SUNS HEAT OR BY ARTIFICIAL WARMTH AT THESE TIMES ITS BREATHING IS PROBABLY OFTEN SUSPENDED FOR A LONG PERIOD AND WERE IT NOT THAT AS THE FOLLOWING AMONG MANY EXPERIMENTS SHOW THE MOVEMENTS CAN BE RE NEWED AFTER LONG SUSPENSION THE INSECT WOULD BE MUCH MORE SHORTLIVED AND WOULD PERISH AT ANY CONSIDERABLE FALL OF TEMPERATURE EXP XXI PUT A DRAGONFLY LIBELLULA DEPRESSA WHICH WAS BREATHING AT THE RATE OF ABOUT FORTYFIVE IN THE MINUTE INTO WATER OF THE TEMPERATURE OF 10 F THE RESPI RATORY MOVEMENTS INCREASED TO 110 ON REMOVING THE INSECT AND EXPOSING IT TO THE AIR THEY WERE REDUCED TO FIFTY ON REPLACING IT IN WATER OF THE SAME HEAT THE RESPI RATION AGAIN BECAME GREATLY ACCELERATED BUT VERY QUICKLY CEASED AND WAS NOT RE NEWED FOR A LONG TIME ANOTHER DRAGONFLY BREATHING AT THE RATE OF THIRTYFIVE WAS PUT INTO WATER AT 900 AND ITS RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS WERE RAISED INSTANTLY TO SEVENTY LXP XXII PUT A DRAGONFLY INTO A FREEZING MIXTURE AT 330 AND KEPT IT IN FOR THIRTY SECONDS WHEN TAKEN OUT IT WAS NOT RESPIRING BUT IN LESS THAN 4 MINUTE BEGAN TO RESPIRE AT THE RATE OF THIRTYFIVE IN THE MINUTE I AGAIN IMMERSED IT FOR NEARLY THREE MINUTES THE RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS THIS TIME CEASED MUCH LONGER AND WERE MORE GRADUALLY RENEWED THE GENERAL ACTIVITY OF THE INSECT WAS ALSO MORE DEEPLY AFFECTED AT FIRST IT SEEMED NEARLY INSENSIBLE AND ITS VOLUNTARY MOVEMENTS WERE FEW AND SLUG GISH BUT BY DEGREES IT BECAME ACTIVE WHEN IT WAS BREATHING FAINTLY AND IRREGU LADLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF ITS EXPOSURE TO THE COLD I PUT IT INTO WATER OF THE TEMPERA TURE OF 980 THE RESPIRATIONS ROSE TO 108 BUT THEY WERE STILL FEEBLE AND THE INSECT SHOWED CONSIDERABLE EXCITEMENT EXP XXIITHE TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR BEING 700 F I PUT A DRAGONFLY WHICH WAS BREATHING VIGOROUSLY INTO WATER AT 340 AFTER TWO MINUTES I REMOVED IT AND ALL MOVEMENT HAD ENTIRELY CEASED BUT IN A FEW MINUTES THE RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS WERE RENEWED AND IT QUICKLY RECOVERED I IMMERSED IT AGAIN WITH THE SAME RESULT AFTER WARDS HAVING LET IT REMAIN FOR HALF AN HOUR I GALVANIZED IT WHILE IT WAS PERFECTLYRESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS OF INSECTS 147 MOTIONLESS AND INSENSIBLE AND PRODUCED BOTH RESPIRATORY MOTIONS AND MOVEMENTS OF THE LEGS AND WINGS THE DRAGONFLY IS VERY SUSCEPTIBLE OF GALVANISM BUT IF THE WIRES BE APPLIED TO THE OUTER SURFACE OF THE INSECT THEY PRODUCE LITTLE EFFECT BECAUSE IT IS SO BAD A CONDUCTOR IN ALL THE EXPERIMENTS THEREFORE FROM WHICH I HAVE DRAWN ANY CONCLUSIONS I FIRST REMOVED THE HEAD OF THE INSECT AND THEN PLACING ITS UNDER SURFACE UPPERMOST PASSED A PIN THROUGH THE CENTRE OF THE MOST ANTERIOR PART OF THE THORAX AND ANOTHER THROUGH THE LAST SEGMENT OF THE ABDOMEN AND THEN FIXED THE INSECT TO A TABLE OR FLAT PIECE OF WOOD I THUS OBTAINED A READY CONDUCTION FOR THE GALVANIC CURRENT WHEN THE HEADS OF THE PINS WERE TOUCHED WITH THE WIRES OF THE BATTERY AND HAD THE INSECT IN A CON VENIENT POSITION FOR OBSERVING ITS MOVEMENTS IN REGARD TO THE INFLUENCE OF GALVANISM ON THE RESPIRATORY MOTIONS TO WHICH ALONE AS IN THE FORMER OBSERVATIONS I SHALL HERE REFER ITS ALMOST CONSTANT EFFECT IS TO ACCELE RATE THEM I HAVE BY ITS INFLUENCE INCREASED THE RESPIRATIONS FROM THIRTY TO 150 IN THE MINUTE BUT A LESS INCREASE E G FROM THIRTY TO FIFTY WAS MORE USUAL SOME TIMES WHILE GALVANISING IN THE METHOD DESCRIBED ABOVE I HAVE OBSERVED AN ALMOST PERSISTENT RESPIRATORY CONTRACTION SO LONG AS THE CURRENT WAS CONTINUED AND ON BREAKING THE CURRENT THE RESPIRATORY RELAXATIONS AND CONTRACTIONS ALTERNATED AS BEFORE THE EFFECTS OF GALVANISM ON THE RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS ARE WELL SEEN WHEN THE IN SECT HAS BEEN INFLUENCED BY CHLOROFORM FOR EXAMPLE I EXPOSED A RECENTLY CAUGHT DRAGONFLY TO CHLOROFORM VAPOUR SOON SENSIBILITY AND ALL MOTIONS CEASED INCLUDING THE RESPIRATORY I TRIED MANY PLATES OF A TROUGH EXCITED FIRST BY WATER AND THEN BY ACID BUT EQUALLY WITHOUT EFFECT BUT HAVING WAITED TILL THE RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS WERE RESUMED I AGAIN EMPLOYED THE SAME POWER AND EXCITED THE CONTRACTIONS AS OFTEN AS I CHOSE MAKING THEM MUCH MORE POWERFUL THAN THEY WERE WHEN NOT THUS STIMULATED THE FOLLOWING CHIEF CONCLUSIONS MAY BE DRAWN FROM THE SERIES OF OBSERVATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN RELATED 1 THE RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS OF DRAGONFLIES AND PROBABLY OF OTHER INSECTS ARE NATURALLY SUBJECT TO CONSIDERABLE AND FREQUENT VARIATIONS IN FORCE AND RATE THE CAUSES OF MANY OF THESE VARIATIONS BEING AS YET UNKNOWN 2 THE RESPIRATIONS ARE ALWAYS QUICKENED BY EXERCISE EMOTION RISE OF TEMPERATURE GALVANISM AND MECHANICAL IRRITATION AND THE LAST THREE AGENTS QUICKEN THEM IN THE DECAPITATED AS WELL AS IN THE PERFECT INSECT 3 THE RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS OF EACH SEGMENT OF THE TRUNK ARE IN SOME MEASURE  IN THESE EXPERIMENTS THE CHANGES OF TEMPERATURE WERE PRODUCED BY SUBMERSION IN WATER BUT MANY OTHERS SHOWED THAT SUBMERSION IN WATER OF THE SAME TEMPERATURE AS THE AIR PRODUCED NO SIMILAR EFFECTS AND THAT THOSE HERE DESCRIBED WERE EQUALLY PRODUCED IN AIR OF SIMILARLY VARIED TEMPERATURE148 MR W F BARLOW ON THE RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS OF INSECTS INDEPENDENT OF THE REST THEY MAY BE PERFORMED IN SEPARATE SEGMENTS PROVIDED THEIR NERVOUS GANGLIA AND CORDS ARE ENTIRE AND NOT PARALYSED BY SUCH INFLUENCE AS THAT OF CHLOROFORM OR ETHER 4 THE REMOVAL OF THE HEAD INCLUDING THE SUPRA AND SUBCESOPHAGEALTGANGLIA DOES NOT LIKE THE REMOVAL OF THE MEDULLA OBLONGATA OF THE VERTEBRATE ANIMAL PUT A STOP TO THE RESPIRATORY IMOVEMENTS BUT DIMINISHES THEIR FREQUENCY AND FORCE AND DEPRIVES THEM OF ALL INFLUENCE OF THE WILL AND OF MENTAL EMOTIONS 5 THE SHOCK INFLICTED IN THE SUDDEN DESTRUCTION OF THE HEAD OR OF THE TERMINAL PART OF THE ABDOMEN GENERALLY STOPS ALL THE RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS FOR A TIME AND GREATLY ENFEEBLES THEM DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE INSECTS LIFE 6 THE GENERAL TENDENCY OF THE OBSERVATIONS IS TO CORROBORATE THE OPINION OF THE SELFSUFFICIENCY OF THE SEVERAL GANGLIA FOR THE MOVEMENTS OF THEIR APPROPRIATE SEG MENTS AND THUS FAR OF THEIR ESSENTIAL INDEPENDENCE AT THE SAME TIME THEIR MUTUAL RELATION AND INFLUENCE ARE PROVED BY THE COORDINATE SIMILAR MOVEMENTS OF THE SEG MENTS AND BY THE DIFFUSED INFLUENCE OF SHOCKS

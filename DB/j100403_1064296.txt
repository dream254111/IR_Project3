applies to the case where the larceny was in one county and the indictment in another both counties being in the same state State v Bartlett 11 Vt 650 Worthington v State 58 Md 403 42 Am Rep 388 1 BISHOP CRIM LAW 8 ed 76 Other cases hold that the accused can be indicted only in the state in which the crime was committed People v Schenck 2 Johns N Y 479 Lee v State 64 Ga 203 37 Am Rep 67 Strouther v Cone 92 Va 789 22 S E 852 A dis tinction has sometimes been made when the property was stolen in one state and carried into another and when it was stolen in a foreign country and brought into one of the states Thus it was held that one who stole goods in a foreign country and brought them into Massa chusetts was not guilty of larceny there Commonwealth v Upirichard 3 Gray Mass 434 63 Am Dec 762 But there is authority to the con trary People v Burk 11 Wend N Y 129 In the case where larceny is committed in one state and the goods are taken into another the weight of authority seems to support the principal case but there is much conflict andthe better rule would seem to be to deny the courts of the state into which the goods have been taken the right to punish the thief because he is certainly guilty and liable to punishment in the state in which he committed the larceny and it seems unjust to follow a rule by which a single crime may be punished twice The rule against double jeopardy which prevents more than one punishment in the same state does not apply as be tween two states MINOR CONFL LAWS 503 EMINENT DOMAINDE FACTO CORPORATIONSThe state applied for an injunction to stay condemnation proceedings on the ground that the defendant was not a corporation de jure Held a de facto corporate ex istence is sufficient to give the right of eminent domain Roaring Springs Townsite Co v Paducah Telephone Co Tex 164 S W 50 This is the rule adopted by the majority of the courts Oregon etc R R Co v Postal Tel Co 49 C C A 663 111 Fed 842 Central Ry Co v Union Springs Ry Co 144 Ala 639 39 So 473 But as the power to exercise the right of eminent domain must be expressly given by legislative authority if the enabling statute gives the right only to legally incorporated corporations then a de jure existence is essential in order to exercise the right See MORAWETZ PRIV CORP  768 Total lack of corporate existence can be shown as a defense to eminent do main proceedings Atkinson v Marietta R R Co 15 Ohio St 21 King ston R R Co v Stroud 132 N C 413 43 S E 913 But a failure to per form a condition subsequent cannot be shown in defense by the owner of the land to be condemned since the corporate existence continues until destroyed by the state in direct proceedings Briggs v Cape Cod Co 137 Mass 71 Cluthe v Evansville etc Ry Co 176 Ind 162 95 N E 543 Contra where nonperformance of the condition destroys the cor porate existence ex proprio vigore Re Brooklyn etc Co 125 N Y 434 dictum It has been held that the expiration of the corporate charter cannot be shown collaterally thus relegating the applicant forRECENT DECISIONS relief to his right to compel the state by mandamus to test that ques tion in quo cwarranto proceedings People v Wayman Il11 99 N E 941 This seems incorrect as after its charter has expired there is no longer even a corporation de facto EVIDENCEPROOF OF FOREIGN LAwAn action was brought to recover damages for personal injuries the plaintiff basing his right to recover on a statute of another state Held the statute must be pleaded and proved Atlantic Coast Line Ry Co v Barton Ga 80 S E 530 As to causes of action arising in one of the thirteen original states in the absence of evidence to the contrary it is universally presumed that the common law is applicable and that the foreign law is the same as the common law existing in the forum Dunn v Adams 1 Ala 527 35 Am Dec 42 Mountain Lake Land Co v Blair 109 Va 147 63 S E 751 But where the cause of action is based on a foreign statute the weight of authority is that such foreign statute must be pleaded and proved Schultz v Howard 63 Minn 196 56 Am St Rep 470 Union Cent L Ins Co v Pollard 94 Va 146 26 S E 421 64 Am St Rep 715 36 L R A 271 Because of the tendency towards uniformity in the statute laws of the various states the courts now lean towards the presumption that the statutory law of the foreign state is the same as that of the forum

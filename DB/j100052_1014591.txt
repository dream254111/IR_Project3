J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1014591,ETHICS OF THE ELECTRICAL ENGINEER,I242692,S6 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY ETHICS OF THE ELECTRICAL ENGINEER BY CARL HERING DSC CONSULTING ELECTRICAL ENGINEER PHILADELPHIA PENNSYLVANIA PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS DEAL PRIMARILY WITH THE FORCES OF NATURE AND ARE THEREFORE GOVERNED IN THEIR WORK BY THE LAWS OF NATURE AS MOTHER NATURE DEMANDS AND INSISTS UPON ABSOLUTE OBEDIENCE TO HER LAWS FROM WHICH THERE IS NO APPEAL AND WHICH CANNOT BE CIRCUMVENTED THE ENGINEER IS BY THE VERY NATURE OF HIS PROFESSION BROUGHT UP TO RESPECT AND OBEY THE LAWS WHICH ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO HIS WORK ANY VIOLATION OF THESE LAWS IS CERTAIN TO BRING ITS OWN PUNISHMENT WITH IT EVEN WITHOUT A TRIAL EITHER IN SHOWING THE IGNORANCE AND THEREFORE UNFITNESS OF THE VIOLATOR OR WHAT IS WORSE THE DELIBERATE PRACTICE OF WHAT HE KNEW WAS WRONG MOREOVER MANY HUMAN LIVES ARE OFTEN AT STAKE WHEN AN ENGINEERING STRUCTURE FAILS HENCE THE ENGINEER REALIZES THAT HIS RESPONSIBILITY IN MANY CASES IS VERY GREAT AS HAS OFTEN BEEN SAID BY WAY OF COMPARISON THE PHYSICIAN CAN BURY HIS MISTAKES SIX FEET UNDER THE GROUND THE LAWYER CAN PASS THE BLAME TO THE JURY COURT OR WITNESSES AND THE MINISTER CAN OFTEN FIND A QUOTATION FROM THE BIBLE WHICH TAKEN LITERALLY MAY SEEM TO UPHOLD HIM IN A MISTAKE HE MAY HAVE MADE BUT WHEN THE ENGINEER MAKES A MISTAKE OR VIOLATES THE LAWS WHICH ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO HIS PROFESSION HE CANNOT HIDE THE BLAME OR PASS IT TO OTHERS SINCE THEN THERE IS GENERALLY NO QUESTION WHO IS RESPON SIBLE AND NO ESCAPE FROM CENSURE HE MUST BE DOUBLY SURE OF WHAT HE DOES AND HOW HE DOES IT HIS PROFESSION IS THEREFORE BY ITS VERY NATURE ON A HIGH PLANE AS FAR AS IT CONCERNS OBEDIENCE TO THE LAWS OF NATURE A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF HIS BRANCH OF LEARNING WHICH INVOLVES A HIGHER EDUCATION EXTENDING OVER MANY YEARS CONSCIEN TIOUSNESS AND REGARD FOR THE EFFECT OF HIS WORK ON OTHERS TRAINING IN SUCH AN ATMOSPHERE CANNOT FAIL TO HAVE AN IMPORTANT BEARING ON THE ETHICS OF ENGINEERING CONDUCT THE RECORDS OF THE PROFES SIONAL LIVES OF MANY NOTED ENGINEERS BEAR THIS OUT AS DOES ALSO THE RUINATION PROFESSIONALLY AS ENGINEERS OF THOSE WHO HAVE VIOLATED THE PRINCIPLES OF A HIGH CODE OF ETHICS THE ENGINEERS INTELLECTUAL RELATIONS WITH HIS SUBJECT INVOLVE A CONTACT WITH NATURE AND HER LAWS THAT BREEDS STRAIGHT THINKING AND DIRECTNESS OF CHARACTER AND FOR THESE THE WORLD IS CONSTANTLY ACCORDING HIM A HIGHER AND MORE HONORABLE PLACE 1 ENGINEERING AS A PROFESSION THAT ENGINEERING IS RECOGNIZED AS ONE OF THE SOCALLED LEARNED PROFESSIONS AND AS SUCH IS IN A CLASS WITH THE MEDICAL LEGAL AND OTHER PROFESSIONS IS PROBABLY NOW GENERALLY CONCEDED AT LEAST WHEN THE NATURE OF THE WORK IS LIMITED TO TRUE ENGINEERING AS DISTIN GUISHED FROM COMMERCIAL WORK AND IS BASED ON HIGH EDUCATIONAL QUALIFICATIONS ACQUIRED AT A COLLEGE OF GOOD STANDING SUPPLEMENTED BY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AND TRAINING AND THE INTELLIGENT APPLI CATION OF SUCH KNOWLEDGE THE RE QUIREMENTS IN EDUCATIONAL QUALIFICA TIONS AND TRAINING ARE QUITE AS GREAT IF NOT GREATER THAN FOR SOME OF THE OTHER PROFESSIONS BUT TO THE MIND OF THE PUBLIC UNFORTUNATELY THE TERM ENGINEER OFTEN MEANS THE MECHANIC WHO OPERATES A LOCOMOTIVE OR SOME OTHER FORM OF ENGINE THE PRECEDING STATEMENTS APPLY TO THE PROFESSION OF ENGINEERING IN GENERAL 1 GANO DUNNETHICS OF THE ELECTRICAL ENGINEER 87 EMBRACING FOUR MAIN DIVISIONS ELEC TRICAL MECHANICAL CIVIL AND MINING WITH MANY SUBDIVISIONS THOUGH THE PAR TICULAR CODES OF ETHICS OF THE VARIOUS BRANCHES MAY DIFFER SOMEWHAT OWING TO THE DIFFERENCES IN THE NATURE OF THE WORK IN GENERAL THEY ARE BASED ON THE LEADING CENTURIESOLD PRINCIPLE DO UNTO OTHERS AS YOU WOULD BE DONE BY AND NOT ON THAT MODERN VERSION OF IT USED BY SOME BUSINESS MEN DO OTHERS OR THEY WILL DO YOU THE CODE OF PRINCIPLES OF PRO FESSIONAL CONDUCT ADOPTED BY THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL EN GINEERS IS PUBLISHED ELSEWHERE IN THIS VOLUME2 THE PRESENT ARTICLE WILL BE LIMITED TO REPLIES TO SOME OF THE QUES TIONS WHICH THE AUTHOR HAS BEEN ASKED CONCERNING HIS PROFESSION THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS ORGANIZED IN 1884 AND HAVING A MEMBERSHIP OF BETWEEN 12000 AND 13000 IS THE ONLY LARGE NATIONAL SOCIETY OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS INCLUDING IN ITS MEMBERSHIP ALL THE LEADING MEN OF THIS DIVISION OF THE ENGINEERING PROFESSION IT MAY BE SAID TO BE THE LAWMAKING ORGANIZATION OF THIS DIVISION AND ITS HIGH MOTIVES MAY BE RELIED UPON IT IS SUPPORTED BY MEMBERSHIP DUES AND HAS THREE GRADES OF MEMBERS OF WHICH THE MUCH COVETED HIGHEST GRADE THAT OF FELLOW IS RESTRICTED TO THOSE WHO HAVE CERTAIN HIGH QUALIFICATIONS YOUNG MEN HAVE EASY ACCESS TO ASSOCIATE MEMBERSHIP FOR THE ADVANCEMENT TO FULL MEMBER SHIP DEFINITE REQUIREMENTS ARE NECES SARY REFERRING CHIEFLY TO THE APPLICANTS RECORD AND TO THE REPUTATION HE HAS GAINED BY HIS WORK IN THE PAST THERE ARE MANY OTHER SOCIETIES AND ORGANIZ TIONS DEALING WITH SPECIAL BRANCHES AND THEY MAY HAVE THEIR OWN CODE OF ETHICS BUT THIS IS THE SENIOR OR PARENT INSTITUTION FOR THE ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING PROFESSION THAT ITS MEMBERS HAVE RESPECT FOR HIGH PRINCIPLES OF PROPER PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT IS INDICATED BY THE FACT THAT NO MEMBER HAS EVER YET BEEN EXPELLED THOUGH IN ONE CASE A MEMBER WHOSE CONDUCT WAS BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE COMMITTEE ON PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT RESIGNED BEFORE THE CASE WAS CONCLUDED AND HIS RESIGNATION WAS PROMPTLY ACCEPTED A SMALL NUMBER OF OTHER CASES HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED BY THIS COMMITTEE FROM TIME TO TIME AT PRESENT A RECOMMENDATION IS UNDER CONSIDERATION THAT A BRIEF STATEMENT OF SUCH CASES AND THE ACTIONS TAKEN BE PUBLISHED IN THE MONTHLY PUBLICATION OF THE INSTITUTE WITHOUT GIVING ANY NAMES THE CLAUSE IN THE CONSTITUTION GOVERNING THE SUBJECT OF EXPULSION IS AS FOLLOWS SEC 15 UPON THE WRITTEN REQUEST OF TEN OR MORE FELLOWS MEMBERS OR ASSOCIATES THAT FOR CAUSE STATED THEREIN A FELLOW MEMBER OR ASSOCIATE OF THE INSTITUTE BE EXPELLED THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS SHALL CONSIDER THE MATTER AND IF THERE APPEARS TO BE SUFFICIENT REASON SHALL ADVISE THE AC CUSED OF THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM HE SHALL THEN HAVE THE RIGHT TO PRESENT A WRITTEN DEFENCE AND TO APPEAR IN PERSON OR BY DULY AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE BEFORE A MEETING OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF WHICH MEETING HE SHALL RECEIVE NOTICE AT LEAST TWENTY DAYS IN ADVANCE NOT LESS THAN TWO MONTHS AFTER SUCH MEETING THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS SHALL FINALLY CONSIDER THE CASE AND IF IN THE OPINION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS A SATISFACTORY DEFENCE HAS NOT BEEN MADE AND THE ACCUSED MEMBER HAS NOT IN THE MEANTIME TENDERED HIS RESIGNA TION HE SHALL BE EXPELLED THE NEED FOR PRINCIPLES OF ENGINEERING CONDUCT FROM THE NATURE OF THE DIFFERENT ENGINEERING BRANCHES DIFFERENCES ARISE WHICH HAVE SOME BEARING ON PRO FESSIONAL CONDUCT UNDER THE BROAD TERM OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS THERE ARE INCLUDED SALESMEN CONTRACTORS MANU 2 SEE APPENDIX PAGE 97488 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY FACTURERS ADMINISTRATORS ORGANIZERS FINANCIERS PROMOTERS ETC MANY OF WHOM MAY HAVE STARTED AS COLLEGEBRED ENGINEERS BUT HAVE BRANCHED OFF INTO THESE OTHER VOCATIONS FOR WHICH THEY WERE OFTEN VERY WELL FITTED BY REASON OF THEIR ENGINEERING TRAINING THEIR INTERESTS ARE HOWEVER SOMETIMES DI RECTLY OPPOSED TO MANUFACTURERS AND THOSE ENTRUSTED WITH THE SELLING OF A PRODUCT OR PROJECT THE EXIGENCIES OF SELLING ARE SO CONSTANTLY FORCED UPON THEM THAT IT PRODUCES IN THEIR CIRCLES A COMMERCIAL ATMOSPHERE QUITE AT VARIANCE WITH STRICT PROFESSIONAL VIEWS TO QUOTE FROM A LEADING ENGINEERING JOURNAL TECHNICAL JOURNALS THEM SELVES MAY NOT ALWAYS BE FREE FROM THE INFLUENCE OF THEIR ADVERTISERS ANOTHER TECHNICAL JOURNAL LAST YEAR SAID EDI TORIALLY IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT THE YEAR 1921 WILL SEE REAL PROGRESS IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CODES OF ETHICS IN THE VARIOUS ENGINEERING SOCIETIES OR BETTER THE ESTABLISHMENT OF GENERAL FUNDA MENTAL PRINCIPLES OF ENGINEERING ETHICS ON WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL SOCIETIES MAY BUILD STILL ANOTHER TECHNICAL JOURNAL ASKS IS ENGINEERING A PROFESSION OR A BUSINESS AND IMPLIES THAT IT MUST BE ONE OR THE OTHER STATING THAT VWE ARE AT THE PARTING OF THE WAYS THIS DISTINCTION REFERS TO THE MODERN LARGE ORGANIZATIONS AS DISTINGUISHED FROM THE INDIVIDUAL ENGINEER IN CON DUCTING ENGINEERING WORK IT IMPLIES THE OLD SAYING THAT CORPORATIONS HAVE NO SOULS THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE ETHICS OF SUCH LARGE ORGANIZATIONS AND OF THE INDIVIDUAL ENGINEER IS A SUBJECT OF DISCUSSION WHICH SPACE DOES NOT PERMIT GOING INTO HERE WITHIN THE NEAR PAST ANOTHER DE PARTURE OF A SOMEWHAT PSYCHOLOGICAL NATURE HAS BEEN ADDED TO THE ENGINEER ING PROFESSION THAT OF THE SCIENCE OF DEALING WITH MEN AS EXEMPLIFIED IN THE LEGEND IN THE GREAT NATIONAL ENGINEERING LIBRARY IN NEW YORK CITY WHICH STATES AS A CONCEPTION OF ENGINEERING ENGINEERINGTHE ART OF ORGANIZING AND DIRECTING MEN AND OF CONTROLLING THE FORCES AND MATERIALS OF NATURE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE HUMAN RACE THE LAST PART OF THIS LEGEND WAS FORMERLY ONE OF THE DEFINITIONS OF AN ENGINEER THE FORMER CLAUSE HAS MORE RECENTLY BEEN ADDED THOUGH NOT BY UNANIMOUS CONSENT IN THE OPINION OF SOME THE TERM ENGINEERING IS BEING BROADENED TOO FAR IT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO DRAW SHARP LINES BETWEEN THE MANY DIFFERENT PRACTICES AS TO WHERE TRUE ENGINEERING BEGINS AND ENDS THE TITLE OF EN GINEER IS A COVETED ONE AND RIGHTLY SO AS LONG AS IT IMPLIES A LONG AND DIFFICULT COURSE OF EDUCATION AND TRAIN ING AND IT IS THEREFORE NATURAL THAT ITS APPROPRIATION IS BROADENING A CODE OF ETHICS IS NATURALLY A DIFFERENT MATTER FOR ONE WHO DEALS WITH THE APPLICATION OF NATURES LAWS OF MATTER AND ENERGY FOR THE BENEFIT OF MANKIND THAN FOR ONE WHO DEALS MERELY WITH GETTING THE LARGEST NUMBER OF DOLLARS THOUGH OF COURSE THE TRUE ENGINEER MUST OF NE CESSITY ALSO CONSIDER THE COST OF PROJECTS FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE PRESENT ARTICLE HOWEVER THE TERM PROFESSIONAL EN GINEER MAY BE SUPPOSED TO APPLY TO THOSE WHO OCCUPY THEMSELVES EX CLUSIVELY WITH THE TRUE PROFESSION OF ENGINEERING IN ITS OLDER SENSE OF AP PLYING THE LAWS OF MATTER AND ENERGY TO THE BENEFIT OF MANKIND BY THE DESIGN CONSTRUCTION AND USE OF EN GINEERING STRUCTURES THE STATEMENT OF FRANCIS BACON IN THE PREFACE TO HIS MAXIMS OF THE LAW APPLIES TO PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS AS WELL I HOLD EVERY MAN A DEBTOR TO HIS PRO FESSION FROM THE WHICH AS MEN OF COURSE DO SEEK TO RECEIVE CONTENANCE AND PROFIT SO OUGHT THEY OF DUTY TO ENDEAVOR THEMSELVES BY WAY OF AMENDS TO BE A HELP AND ORNAMENT THEREUNTO89 THE ENGINEER AND PUBLIC SERVICE AS THE PROGRESS OF THE WORLD THE COMFORTS OF MAN AND HIS ABILITY TO PRODUCE ARE SO VERY LARGELY DUE TO THE WORK OF THE ENGINEER HIS WORK IS OF THE VERY GREATEST IMPORTANCE HE THEREFORE NATURALLY INTERESTS HIMSELF ALSO IN THE PUBLIC WELFARE IN BEHALF OF WHICH LIE SHOULD BE READY TO APPLY HIS SPECIAL KNOWLEDGE SKILL AND TRAINING FOR THE USE AND BENEFIT OF MANKIND AND WITH LOYALTY TO HIS COUNTRY EVIDENCE OF WHICH WAS SHOWN IN THE RECENT WAR WHICH TO A GREATER EXTENT THAN EVER BEFORE WAS DEPENDENT ON THE SKILL OF THE ENGINEER IN CONNECTION WITH TESTIMONY BY ENGINEERS IN LEGAL CASES A CLAUSE IN ONE OF THE ENGINEERING CODES SAYS TO RENDER REPORTS OR TESTIMONY INTENDED TO DECEIVE IS HIGHLY UNPROFESSIONAL A MAXIM WHICH CONTRASTS WITH THE GUIDING PRINCIPLE OF SOME LAWYERS WIN THE CASE WIN IT HONESTLY IF YOU CAN BUT WIN IT THE ENGINEERS WORK IS OFTEN CON NECTED WITH SOME FORM OF PUBLIC SERVICE AND HE IS THEREFORE CONCERNED WITH THE PUBLIC AND WITH PUBLIC WELFARE HIS OBLIGATIONS TO SERVE THE PUBLIC CON SCIENTIOUSLY TO THE BEST OF HIS ABILITIES ARE THEREBY INSTILLED INTO HIM HIS NATURAL REPUGNANCE TO ACT AGAINST THE INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC OR OF THOSE IN HIS CHARGE WHEN URGED TO DO SO BY HIS LESS SCRUPU LOUS SUPERIOR OFFICER PERHAPS A POLITI CIAN A CONTRACTOR OR A FINANCIER HAS COST MANY AN ENGINEER HIS POSITION UNTIRING EFFORTS ARE MADE BY THOSE OF EXPERIENCE IN THE PROFESSION TO ADVANCE THE STANDARDS OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF THE RISING GENERATION OF ENGINEERS IN THE SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES THE SUBJECT IS FREQUENTLY DISCUSSED AT THE SESSIONS OF THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS BETWEEN THOSE WHO KNOW WHAT IS NEEDED IN ACTUAL PRACTICE AND THOSE WHO DO THE TEACHING AND TRAINING BOTH WILLINGLY COBPERATE TO THE GREAT ADVANTAGE OF THE STUDENT ANY SPECIAL RECRUITING FOR THE PRO FESSION OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING SEEMS HARDLY NECESSARY AS THE GREAT INTEREST TAKEN BY MANY YOUNG MEN IN THIS BRANCH OF ENGINEERING SEEMS TO BE SUFFICIENT AN EMPLOYMENT SERVICE IS CONDUCTED BY THE INSTITUTE IN GENERAL ANY FORM OF SERVICE PERTAINING TO ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING EITHER TO ITS MEMBERS THE PROFESSION THE PUBLIC OR THE GOVERNMENT WHICH IS OF SUCH A NATURE THAT IT CAN BEST BE DONE BY THIS LARGE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION INCLUDING IN ITS MEMBERSHIP ALL THE LEADING ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS OF THE COUNTRY AND MANY IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES IS WILLINGLY UNDER TAKEN AND INTELLIGENTLY CARRIED OUT IN MANY INSTANCES THE INSTITUTE HAS SET AN EXAMPLE TO OTHERS

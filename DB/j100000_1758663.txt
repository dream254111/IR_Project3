tllhat of thle Ilistory of the de veloplenlt of tlie different bralnl ies If mathematical scieiice in coinnectioni with tile older physical sci encees  astronomy and mechlanics The matlhemlnati cal

llydrostatics Ilis dictum about the lever hlis  Eiprpca and the story of tlie defenIce of Syracuse are well known Following these we have a worthy series of nanims inclhuding the astrono mers Ilipparcluts IC 150 anld Ptolemy AD 125 and ceniing say with Pappus AI 400 but coin tinued by their A rablialln ommllentators and the Ital ian and other European geometers of the sixteenth century and later wlio pursued the Greek geometry The Greek arithmuetic was from the wanit of a plroper notation siiigularly ctiumbrous and lifficult and it was for astronollmlical purposes sutperseded by the sexagesimial arithmietic attributed to Ptolemy but probably known before Ihis time The use of the present socalled Arabic figures became genleral among Arabian writers on arithml etic allnl astronomy about the middle of the tenth century but it was inot introduced into Europe until about two centuries later Algebra among the Greeks is represented almost exclusively by tile treatise of Diophantus AD 150  in fact a work on the theory of nunm bers containing questions relating to square andl cube numberg and other properties of ntumbers with their solutions This lhas nio historical connection withli tlihe later algebra introduced into Italy from tie east by Leonardl Bonacci of Pisa AD 12021208 and successftully cultivated in tile fifteenth and six teciutlh centuries by Lucas Paciolus or le Burgo Tartaglia Cardan adltl Ferrari Later on we have Vieta 154016003 Ilarriot already referred to WaVl lis andiI otlhers Astronomy is of coiurse inItimnately connected with geometry Tlhe Iost simlple facts of observation of tile heavenly bodies can oiily be slated ill geolnetri cal language for instance tlhat tli stars describe circles ablout tIle Polestar or tliat tIle difelreit posi tions of the st1n amiong the fixed stars in tlte course of the year form a circle For astrolomical calcula tioiis it was fountd neIcessary to deterllille tie arc of a circle by meancs of its chord Tle Ilotion is as old as IIipparchllus a work of whloim is referredl to as consisting of twelve books on tlie clhords of circular arcs We Ilave AD 125 Ptolemys Almagest tile first book of whilich contains a tabile of arcs and chords witli tile mllethod of constructionl and among other theorems on thle subject he gives there the theorem afterwards inserted in Euclid book vi prop I relating to the rectangle contained by tile diagonals of a quadrilateral inscribed in a circle Tlie Arabians mnade the improvelnent of using in place of the cliord of an arc the sine or half chord of double tile arc and so brought tlIe theory into tlie form in which it is used in modern tri gonometry The before mentioned theorem of Ptolemlly  or ratlher a par ticular case of it  translated into the notation of sines gives the expression for tile siine of the sum of two arcs in terms of the sines and cosines of tile compolnent arcs and it is thus tlie fundamental tlheoremL0 on the subject We lhave in the fifteenth and sixteenth ceilturies a series of Imathemnaticianls wlio with woiiderful enthusiasm and perseverance calculated tables of tile trigonomletrical or circu lar functions  Purbach Miiller or Regiomontalus  SCIENCE Copernicus Reinhold Maurolycus Vieta and many others The tabulations of the functions tangent and secant are due to Reinhold and Maurolyculs re spectively Logarithms were invented not exclusively with reference to the calculation of trigonomnetrical tables but in order to facilitate numerical calculations gen erally The invention is due to John Napier of Mer chiston who died in 1618 at sixtyseven years of age The notion was based upon refined mathematical rea soning on the comparison of the spaces described by two points  the one moving with a uniform velocity the other with a velocity varying according to a given law It is to be observed that Napiers logarithms were nearly but not exactly those which are now called sometimes Napierian but more usually hy perbolic logarithms those to the base e and that the change to the base 10 the great step by which the invention was perfected for the object in view was indicated by Napier but actually made by Henry Briggs afterwards Savilian professor at Oxford d 1630 But it is the hyperbolic logarithm which is mathematically important The direct function e or exp x which has for its inverse the hyperbolic log aritllm presented itself but not in a prominent way Tables were calculated of the logarithms of numbers and of those of the trigonometrical functions The circular function and the logarithm were thus invented each for a practical purpose separately and without any proper connection with each other The functions are connected through the theory of im aginaries and form together a group of the utmost importance throughout mathematics but this is math ematical theory the obligation of mathematics is for the discovery of the functions Forms of spirals presented themselves in Greek architecture and the curves were considered mathe matically by Archimedes The Greek geometers in vented some other curves more or less interesting but recondite enough in their origin A curve which might have presented itself to anybody that described by a point in the circumference of a rolling carriage wheel was first noticed by Mersenne in 1615 and is the curve afterwards considered by Roberval Pascal and others under the name of the roulette other wise the cycloid Pascal 1C2362 wrote at the age of seventeen his  Essais pour les coniques  in seven short pages full of new views on these curves and in which he gives in a paragraph of eight lines his theory of the inscribed hexagon Kepler 15711630 by his empirical determination of the laws of planetary motion brought iiito con nection with astronomy one of the forms of conic the ellipse and established a foundation for the theo ry of gravitation Contemporary with him for most of his life we have Galileo 15641642 the founder of the science of dynamics  and closely following upon Galileo we have Isaac Newton 16431727 The Philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica known as the Principia was first published in 1687 The physical statical or dynamical questions which presented themselves before the publication of the Principia were of no particular mathemati 503 cal difficulty but it is quite ot erwise with the crowd of interesting questions arising out of the theory of gravitation and which in becoming the subject of mathematical investigation have contributed very much to the advance of mathematics We have the problem of two bodies or what is the same thing that of the niotion of a particle about a fixed centre of force for any law of force we have also the problein mathematically very interesting of the motion of a body attracted to two or more fixed cen tres of force  then next preceding that of the actual solar system the problem of three bodies This has ever been and is far beyond the power of mathemat ics  and it is in the lunar and planetary theories re placed by what is mathematically a different problem  that of the motion of a body under the action of a principal central force and a disturbing force or in one mode of treatment by the problem of disturbed elliptic motion I would remark that we have here an instance in which an astronomical fact the ob served slow variation of the orbit of a planet has directly suggested a mathematical method applied to other dynamical problems and which is the basis of very extensive modern investigations in regard to systems of differential equations Againl imniedi ately arising out of the theory of gravitation we have the problem of finding the attraction of a solid body of any given form upon a particle solved by Newton in the case of a homogeneous sphere but which is far more difficult in the next succeeding cases of the spheroid of revolution very ably treated by Maclau rin and of the ellipsoid of three unequal axes There is perhaps no problem of mathematics which has been treated by so great a variety of methods or has given rise to so much interesting investigation as this last problem of the attraction of an ellipsoid upon an interior or exterior point It was a dynam ical problem that of vibrating strings by which Lagrange was led to the theory of the representation of a function as the sum of a series of nmultiple sines and cosines and connected with this we have the expansions in terms of Legendres functions Pn sug gested to him by the question just referred to of the attraction of an ellipsoid The subsequent investiga tions of Laplace on the attractions of bodies differing slightly froni the sphere led to the functions of two variables called Laplaces functions I have been speaking of ellipsoids  but the general theory is that of attractions which has become a very wide branch of niodern mathematics Associated with it we have in particular the names of Gauss LejeuneDirichlet and Green and I must not omit to mention that the theory is now one relating to ndimensional space Another great problem of celestial mechan ics that of the motion of the earth about its centre of gravity in the most simple case that of a body not acted upon by any forces is a very interesting one in the mathematical point of view I may mention a few other instances where a prac tical or physical question has connected itself with the development of mathematical theory I have spoken of two map projections the stereographic dating from Ptolemy and Mercators projection in OCTOBER 12 1883504 S CIE vented by Edward Wright about the year 1600 Each of these as a particular case of the orthomorphic pro jection belongs to the theory of the geometrical rep resentation of an imaginary variable I have spoken also of perspective and in an omitted paragraph of the representation of solid figures employed in Monges descriptive geometry Monge it is well known is the author of the geometrical theory of the curvature of surfaces and of curves of curvature He was led to this theory by a problem of earthwork  from a given area covered with earth of uniform thickness to carry the earth and distribute it over an equal given area with the least amount of cartage For the solution of the corresponding problem in solid geometry he had to consider the intersecting normals of a surface and so arrived at the curves of curvature see his Me6moire sur les deblais et les remblais Mem de lacad 1781 The normals of a surface are again a particular case of a doubly infi nite system of lines and are so connected with the modern theories of congruences and complexes The undulatory theory of light led to Fresnels wavesurface  a surface of the fourth order by far the most interesting one which had then presented it self A geometrical property of this surface that of having tangent planes each touching it along a plane curve in fact a circle gave to Sir W R Hamilton the theory of conical refraction The wavesurface is now regarded in geometry as a particular case of Kummers quartic surface with sixteen conical points and sixteen singular tangent planes My imperfect acquaintance as well with the mathe matics as the physics prevents me from speaking of the benefits which the theory of partial differential equations has received from the hydrodynamical the ory of vortex motion and from the great physical theories of electricity magnetism and energy It is difficult to give an idea of the vast extent of modern mathematics This word extent is not the right one I mean extent crowded with beautiful de tail not an extent of mere uniformity such as an objectless plain but of a tract of beautiful country seen at first in the distance but which will bear to be rambled through and studied in every detail of hillside and valley stream rock wood and flower But as for any thing else so for a mathematical the ory beauty can be perceived but not explained As for mere extent I might illustrate this by speak ing of the dates at which some of the great ex tensions have been made in several branches of mathematical science And in fact in the address as written I speak at considerable length of the extensions in geometry since the time of Descartes and in other specified subjects since the commencement of the century These subjects are the general theory of the function of an imaginary variable the leading known func tions viz the elliptic and single thetafunctions and the Abelian and multiple thetafunctions the theory of equations and the theory of numbers I refer also to some theories outside of ordinary mathematics the multiple algebra or linear associative algebra of the late Benjamin Peirce the theory of Argand War NCE VOL II No 36 ren and Peacock in regard to imaginaries in plane geometry Sir W R Hamiltons quaternions Clif fords biquaternions the theories developed in Grass manns  Ausdehnungslehre with recent extensions thereof to nonEuclidian space by Mr Homersham Cox also Booles Mathematical logic and a work connected with logic but primarily mathematical and of the highest importance Shuberts Abzahlende geometrie 1878 I remark that all this in regard to theories outside of ordinary mathematics is still on the text of the vast extent of modern mathematics In conclusion I would say that mathematics have steadily advanced from the time of the Greek geome ters Nothing is lost or wasted The achievements of Euclid Archimedes and Apollonius are as admir able now as they were in their own days Descartes method of coordinates is a possession forever But mathematics has never been cultivated more zealous ly and diligently or with greater success than in this century  in the last half of it or at the present time The advances made have been enormous The actual field is boundless the future full of hope In regard topure mathematics we may most confidently say   Yet I doubt not through the ages one increasing purpose runs And the thoughts of men are widened with the process of the suns THE ENDOWMENT OF BIOLOGICAL RESEA R CH1 IT has become the custom for the presidents of the various sections of this association to open the pro ceedings of the departments with the chairmanship of which they are charged by formal addresses In reflecting on the topics which it might be desirable for me to bring under your notice as your president on the present occasion it has occurred to me that I might use this opportunity most fitly by departing somewhat from the prevailing custom of reviewing the progress of science in some special direction dur ing the past year and that instead of placing before you a summary of the results recently obtained by the investigations of biologists in this or that line of inquiry I might ask your attention and that of the external public who are wont to give some kindly consideration to the opinions expressed on these oc casions to a matter which is even more directly con nected with the avowed object of our association namely the advancement of science I propose to place before you a few observations upon the pro vision which exists in this country for the advance ment of that branch of science to which section D is dedicated namely biology I am aware that it is usual for those who speak of men of science and their pursuits to ignore altogether such sordid topics as the one which I have chosen to bring forward A certain pride on the one hand and a willing acquiescence on the other hand usually prevent those who are professionally concerned with 1 An address to the biological section of the

Northrup Company Inc By MORRIS E LEEDS President SUCH phrases as industrial democ racy and the democratic control of industry have in the past few years come into wide use in connection with a great range of economic experiments all of which have in a general way as motive a wider sharing of the control and rewards of industry among those engaged in it However there does not seem to be any common agreement as to how the conception of democracy taken from the realm of politics shall be given an industrial translation In political life we think of democracy as a form of government in which all who attain the status of voters have equal authority but among writers on in dustrial subjects few if any seem to have that conception of it They do not suggest as a program for the present or even a goal for the future that every one engaged shall have an equal vote in electing the management and I cannot find that there is in this country any large group of people who believe that such a program should be an ideal future goal Thoughtful representatives of organized labor in common with all others who know the complexities of modern industry inti mately recognize the fact that those who have the responsibility of manage ment have to deal with great ranges of problems which require such special ized training and talents that there are comparatively few who are competent to pass judgment on their capabilities THE KEYNOTE OF INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY Equality of opportunity is another expression of democratic idealism is which may be contrasted with equality of power and is one which it seems to me is much more reasonably appli cable to industry I suggest that it should be the ideal of democracy in in dustry to insure equality of opportu nitynot equality of power or equal ity of reward but an equal chance for each to rise to that level of reward and power for which he is qualified To illustrate this conception of democracy in industry I shall outline two elements of the organization of the Leeds and Northrup Company which is engaged in the manufacture of pre cision instruments and employs some four hundred and fifty people INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION The first element is that which has to do with the executive group using that word in its wide sense as applying to all the minor as well as the major executives This element of the exper iment is based on the belief that our modern capitalistic industrial system evolved during the past one hundred and fifty years with its great and beneficent wealth producing powers has been in spite of its glaring faults a tremendous advantage to our civiliza tion The conviction that no sug gested substitute for it promises any thing like equal advantages and that therefore it is fundamentally impor tant that it be conserved and devel oped and that this can be done only under the management of competent executives In order to conserve the hard won experience of the past and on that firm foundation build a structure for theTHE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY future even more socially useful the executives must not only be competent but must also have a social sense of responsibility for the welfare of all those engaged in the enterprise as well as for that of the public In the belief that there is no other single factor that will contribute so much to this viewpoint we make it obligatory that the con trolling power shall be vested only in those actively engaged in the business and that the executives shall be the real owners of the voting stock and not responsible to absentee capitalists Voting Privileges The plan provides that only those who are holders of a form of employees shares shall have voting rights These employees shares may be sold only to such employees as have been with the company for at least five years and who receive a salary of at least 1500 per year but they are not sold by a set plan to anything like all of these At any time that there is to be a new issue the trustees who are the qualified repre sentatives of the holders of employees shares decide to what individuals new stock may be issued and how much shall be issued to each it being the in tention that this most qualified group shall select those who are most likely to contribute to the future welfare of the undertaking When a holder of employees shares goes out of the busi ness for any cause his holding is auto matically converted into a form of investment shares which draw a fixed and preferred dividend but do not have a vote except in the contingency of the dividend not being earned The em ployees shares are sold not given to those to whom they are assigned Their value is ascertained by a fixed method depending on the earnings of the business for a number of years pre ceding the time of sale It will be noted that this arrangement makes it possi ble to allow any employee of experience to become a holder of the controlling stock and further that it intends to place the major holdings of this stock in the hands of those who are most competent to exercise control wisely Such arrangements as these have much more influence in securely at taching to an organization an able group of executives than would at first thought be expected A man has a much greater incentive to stay when he is assured that he has an opportu nity to succeed to such portion of the management as his abilities and service may justify and he is under much less temptation to go out and take part in a competitive enterprise than when the form of organization makes it reason ably sure that the control will succeed to some fortunate inheritor of a major ity interest The experience of the Leeds and Northrup Company seems to indicate that executives chosen under this plan naturally come to regard themselves as important ele ments of an organization which has large responsibility for the welfare of all engaged in it and distinct obliga tions of service to the public The Cobperative Association Naturally the group of actual and potential executives is a minor fraction of the employees and no scheme of or ganization could reasonably call itself democratic that did not take into ac count a very much larger group To meet this situation the Cooperative Association was organized a few years ago and includes in its membership all of the employees of the company from the latest comer to the president This association belongs perhaps in the general family of shop committees but differs from most of such committees in its allinclusive membership The formation of this association was a deliberate and democratic procedure 14DEMOCRATIC ORGANIZATION IN INDUSTRY The project was discussed in the first instance by a comparatively small group of people who approved it and began to give it a definite form then by a larger group of some sixty of the older employees who also approved it and further contributed to its definite ness and following that by a group representing all of the employees It worked for something over a year with a provisional constitution during all of which time it had a constitution committee under appointment As a result the constitution in its present form embodies a considerable amount of actual experience The Cooperative Association has for its objectquoting from the constitution To preserve and strengthen the traditional bonds of coiperation between the company and its employees to the end that through understanding and just deal ing with one another they may pro mote their mutual welfare and may jointly render effective service to the users of scientific instruments and to the public When the association was first formed there was no consideration of limiting its members to a particular group of workers Later on the ques tion was raised as to whether it should not be limited to manual workers be low the grade of foremen with possi bly other associations or committees representing other grades of workers The question was thoroughly dis cussed and there was unanimous agreement that the best interests of all would be served by recognizing the essential unity of interest of all em ployees and by having them all repre sented in one association rather than by having two or three associations representing limited groups with lim ited viewpoints The association functions through a board of councillors which is elected at large by the proportional system of representation each employee having one vote unless he has been with the company more than three years in which case he has two votes experi ence being thereby given additional weight This additional weight was considered important by the older em ployees and has not so far as known caused any dissatisfaction among the newer ones The Two Purposes of the Co6perative Association The name cooperative is properly descriptive of the activities of the asso ciation in two ways The first purpose of the association is cooperation among the employees in a wide variety of activ ities in which they can be mutually help ful Among these may be mentioned athletics entertainments such as dances dramatic clubs etc lecture courses accident and sick relief associa tions coiperative store oversight of dispensary and lunch room and the pub lication of apaper The second manner in which the work is cooperative is in relation to the problems that have to do more directly with the business and in which the employees have a vital in terest Among these are the good or der of all parts of the building and grounds convenience and comfort of work places locker rooms washrooms etc plans for the most rapid possible assimilation of newcomers hours of work overtime pay lateness and ab sence arrangements holidays proce dure in safeguarding employees in case of discharge and wages The association has active commit tees on all of these subjects Those which have to do purely with the activ ities of the employees as a group of people mutually associated such as athletics and entertainments function without any contact with the manage ment of the business Those which have to do with the second group of 15THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY subjects such as wages work in cobp eration with committees on the same subject appointed by the management In other words these committees are joint committees Most of them are standing committees Through the agency of these committees a large range of subjects of the class men tioned has had very frank and thor oughgoing discussion and many of them are still under discussion Just now the wages committee is a particu larly important one as it is endeavor ing to evolve a definite payment policy and in addition has under consideration all such questions as vacation arrange ments hours of work and overtime pay Only after many years of experience with an association like this under varying business conditions and with a changing personnel would one be justi fied in pronouncing it a success or fail ure The Leeds and Northrup Coop erative Association has been organized only long enough for us to have had experience with two councils but dur ing that time we have gone through the vicissitudes incident to a great rush of war work a sudden slackening at the signing of the armistice and during the past few months a rapid increase in business These conditions have intro duced many important problems which have been discussed by the company with the council The net result of all this discussion is a strong feeling that the interests both of the employees and of the company have been dis tinctly furthered by this frank mutual discussion In all of the subjects under the second group such as wages and hours of work in which the council gives active assistance in forming the com panys policy it does not have any actual power The final authority rests with the management There is always however an earnest effort on the part of both sets of members form ing the joint committees to arrive at conclusions that will be acceptable both to the employees and to the man agement Anyone who has dealt with similar situations will recognize that the council has in its power to consider these subjects and to call for joint dis cussion of them with representatives of the management very real if not formal powers for the management could not lightly turn down recommen dations arrived at after such careful discussion Experience has shown that the rank and file of the employees elect to coun cil a considerable number of represent atives of the grade of foremen and sub foremen in spite of the fact that their very much larger numbers would enable them to make up a council com posed entirely of people below these grades The fact that the council has in it representatives of all departments of the business including the sales department and representatives of varying grades results in a much more satisfactory discussion of questions than would be likely otherwise to take place With a council thus made up I believe there is much less likelihood of a onesided viewpoint becoming crys tallized and therefore difficult to adjust than would be the case with a less representative council Among its minor advantages service on the council and its committees is an admirable means of discovering and training people of executive capacity I hope that this brief sketch of these two elements of our organization may have given a fairly clear impression of the ideas and ideals underlying our experiments in industrial democracy Through the many activities of the Co6perative Association and its nu merous committees which in one way and another touch a wide range of employee interests we hope that the employees may acquire a continually 16DEMOCRATIC ORGANIZATION IN INDUSTRY growing knowledge based on real experi ence of the conditions under which groups of people can work together for their mutual good and may come to see how closely their interests are bound together with the welfare of the company and how both depend on worthy service to our customers We can see that the association is bringing about these advantages We hope that the contacts typified by work on common committees may keep the management in sympathetic touch with all classes of employees and keenly alive to their needs as men and women who if industry is to perform its proper function must be enabled to lead the selfsupporting selfrespecting lives of good citizens The manage ment has profited by these contacts and fully expects to continue to do so We hope that the full discussion of the wage problem may lead toward the fundamental basis of high wages namely large production and fair treatment of the public and that satis factory methods may be worked out for giving payment to each worker whether with the hand or brain that is justly proportioned to his contribu tion On this problem we can report but little progress as yet but we be lieve that there is a substantial basis for that hope Through various forms of educa tional work and the activities of the personnel department we try to see that each worker is helped to advance as rapidly as his capabilities and the opportunities above him permit We always seek to fill new positions by ad vancing our own people whenever there are any who are at all qualified and thus keep the path of progress open to them In all this there is nothing radical perhaps nothing that is even new in the sense that it has not been used else where although the particular com bination of elements that make for democracy in the sense of equality of opportunity is probably unique It is not part of mypurpose to attempt an estimate of a possible wider appli cation of these particular plans nor would I have it inferred that I believe that any form of organization can in itself make much of a contribution to the solution of industrial troubles In order to be useful an organization must be the expression of a right spirit in in dustry a real desire to do justice among all of those who are employed in it and to render worthy service to the public In closing I must acknowledge obli gation to the published information in regard to the Dennison Company to the Filene Company for most valuable advice and information in connection with the Co6perative Association and finally I must pay a particular tribute to the works of Ernst Abbe and his establishment of the Carl Zeiss Foun dation to manage the famous optical works at Jena Although we have copied little if anything from that or ganization his splendid idea of dedi cating his industry to the welfare of the totality of its coworkers to the advancement of the art and science of optics and to the good of the public so magnanimously conceived so firmly based on sound practice and so mag nificently successful long after his death has been most inspiring 17

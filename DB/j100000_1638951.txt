EVIDENCE PROVING THAT THE BELLY RIVER BEDS OF ALBERTA ARE EQUIVALENT WITH THE JUDITH RIVER BEDS OF MONTANA ON the twentyfourth of last July a paper of mine appeared in SCIENCE in which I took the ground that the Dog Creek Beds of Montana were equivalent to the Edmonton Beds of Al berta and that the Cow Island Beds of Mon tana should be correlated with the Belly River series of Alberta with the Fort Pierre de posits between I thus took the early views of Professor E D Cope that the Judith River Beds were on top of the Pierre Judging from memory I was unable to believe that the Fort Pierre was on top of the Judith River forma tion I concluded therefore that the sequence of rocks in Montana would be the same as those in Alberta where the Belly River series is below the Pierre and the Edmonton is above Last July however with Mr D B Dowling a senior geologist of the Geological Survey of Canada and my son Charles M who took most of the photographs I spent ten days in the Judith River country going over the same region I walked over in 1876 as Professor Copes assistant I was soon forced by incon testable evidence to change my opinions and accept without reservations the conclusions of Hatcher and Stanton in their fine work on the  Geology and Paleontology of the Judith River Beds We actually added to the weight of the evidence they had gathered by the dis covery as I believe for the first time of some sixty feet of Bear Paw shales on top of the Judith River Beds on the head of Taffy Creek an easterly fork of Dog Creek Also heavy masses on top on the south side of the river near Cow Island Mr R G McConnell deputy minister and director of the Geological Survey of Canada has kindly allowed me to present this paper in a private capacity Mr Dowling being the mouthpiece of

the arrangement of the strata as they have been tilted in all direc tions and at all angles In one place great masses of the rocks often acres in extent have been lifted higher than newer rocks or dropped below them Then the stratigraphical characters of the Claggett shales resemble those of the Pierre so closely it is difficult at first view to tell them apart Last July we followed up the valley of Dog Creek on the road to a sheep ranch on the prairie A couple of miles above where the creek enters the canyon we came to a strip of Claggett shales lifted up besides the Eagle Sandstone and Judith River Beds the shale disintegrating into rather steep slopes over which our road lay We climbed the steep as cent to the ridge some 600 feet above the Mis souri River and followed the divide between the Badlands of the Missouri and of Dog Creek We camped on Taffy Creek an eastern branch of Dog Creek We made a very thorough study of this region making large collections of invertebrates from all the hori zons and secured Myledaphus and sharks teeth from the Eagle Sandstones which with the Claggett shales I am informed forms the base of the Belly River series of Canada On the south side of Taffy Creek below a large timbered Hog Back I found a locality in the gray sandstone of the Judith River Beds that may possibly be the type locality from which we got collections on that memo rable expedition in 1876 when we found the first horned dinosaurs of the United States a blow out as it is called in the west where quite an area in a bed of sandstone had been denuded I found quantities of the teeth of horned plated duckbilled and carnivorous dinosaurs and of Myledaphus bipartitus Cope scales of ganoid fishes vertebrae of Champso saurus and many fragments of turtle shells Trionx etc and what delighted me more a complete footed ischium with most of the illium and pubis of one individual of a hooded trachodont evidently Lambes Stephanosaurus marginatus from the Belly River series of Red Deer River Alberta It was difficult for me not to believe I was in a Red Deer bone bed as the same material was strewn around here in Montana In the Edmonton however the bones have the appearance of having once beenflotsam along a sea shore at the limit of high tide I only found a couple of fragments of turtle shells there while they are very abundant in this bonebed on Taffy Creek Everywhere in this region are two veins of coal on top of the Judith River Beds and im mediately below the Bear Paw shales Above each vein is an oyster bed often three or four feet thick In the Bear Paw shales south of camp with the aid of a sheepherder Mr Dow ling found a fine new Mosasaur evidently a Clidastes as the chevrons are anchylosed to the centra of the vertebras and the end of the tail is expanded into a fin We secured the mandibles with teeth a lot of dorsal vertebrae and nearly 15 feet of the tail We also col lected some fine Ammonites and Baculites as well as a couple of specimens of a Plesiosaur resembling Cimoliosaurus These fossils can not be distinguished from similar ones we procured from the Fort Pierre above the Belly River series in Dead Lodge Canyon on the Red Deer River Alberta But for the uplift ing of the rocks the stratigraphical record would be quite simple A little observation however enabled one to detect the different horizons readily On the ground it would be impossible for one to doubt the sequence of the rocks as given by Hatcher and Stanton in the order beginning at the bottom Eagle Sandstone Claggett shales Judith River Beds and Bear Paw shales on top of all We followed the same trail first traveled by Professor Cope down the prairie level to near Cow Island getting water at Lone Tree spring as in 1876 and camped near our old camp on the Missouri River We found the Bear Paw shales on top of the Judith River Beds on the south side of the river three miles below Cow Island The only difference between the formation here and Dog Creek is the absence of the Eagle Sandstones and Clag gett shales The sculpture and lithological characters of the bad lands approached more 132 SCIENCESCIENCE nearly those of the Dead Lodge Canyon on the Red Deer River Two things have especially impressed me First the close resemblance between the Judith River Beds and the Belly River series in the Dead Lodge Canyon where the Fort Pierre on top and Belly River series below are nearly 500 feet thick Towards its lower end a sandstone like the Eagle is ex posed The second is the finding of a footed ischium of a trachodont in the same bed from which the type of Trackodon mirabilis of Leidy was discovered the same teeth to which he gave the name lying around the ischium That evidently belongs to Lambes Stephano saurus marginatus a crested trachodont My party has already discovered three trachodonts in the Belly River series two with footed ischia and one Lambes Gryposaurus notabilis has an uncrested head We have only found among our forty tons of fossil dinosaurs col lected there a single species of Trachodon The one we mounted from the Edmonton is certainly one Is it possible then that Leidys Trachodon mirabilis was a crested duckbill This is a question impossible of solution as the type tooth might have come from one of three or four of the Trachodonts of the Belly River series Then the use by Marsh of two horn cores to found the genus Ceratops on and the family Ceratopsia rests on a shaky foundation along with Copes Monoclonius These horns of Marsh might have come from any of the horned dinosaurs of that time ex cept Centrosaurus and in spite of the splendid and complete skulls of horned dinosaurs we have secured from the Belly River series we know nothing of Monoclonius except what little if anything can be learned from the types Then the richness of the fauna in genera and species both of duckbilled plated horned and carnivorous dinosaurs was at high tide during Belly River time The formation therefore must have covered a wide area and it is not surprising to know that Brown got a Gryposaurus skull in New Mexico A thor ough exploration of the beds in Montana will doubtless yield rich returns It is also inter esting to note that I got a plated dinosaur 133 some years ago in the Niobrara Chalk of Kan sas described by Weiland doubtless a near relative of Lambes Europlocephalus from the Red Deer River Evidently then the Cre taceous dinosaurs continued to live and thrive through Cretaceous time in the west but few bones found lodgment in the ocean sediment of thousands of feet of Dakota Fort Benton Niobrara Fort Pierre and Fox Hills groups It appears evident too that the life of the Pierre ocean was continuous with the Belly River whose shores were only raised a few feet above tide water Many Plesiosaurs found entrance to the freshwater lakes and mingled their bones with the reptilian fauna Hatcher himself once told me he believed all the beds of the Judith River region were Pierre from top to bottom though I suppose land fresh water and marine beds will always be known by different names CHARLES H STERNBERG THE TRAVERTINE RECORD OF BLAKE SEA AN outlying mass of fragmental granite projects from a spur of the Santa Rosa Moun tains into the Cahuilla basin in southeastern California the crest of the rocks rising above the ancient shore line of Blake Sea which filled the basin to a level something above that of present high tide in the Gulf of California1 This cape is designated as Travertine Point in our publications as the surface of the granite boulders is covered to a varying depth with dendritic and lithoid tufa2 Some marks and figures presumably carved by Indians in the travertine have long been known and were seen by us on our first visit to the place in 1906 In the continuation of our work on the Salton Sea it was realized that these figures might possibly yield some evi dence as to the duration and variations in level of the ancient Blake Sea and of the smaller modern Salton Lake A visit to the formation was accordingly See Plate 1 The Salton Sea MacDougal et al Publ Carnegie Institution of Washington No 193 1914 2

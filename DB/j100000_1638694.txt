resigned the professor ship of chemistry in Washburn College to accept an associate professorship of chemistry in charge of organic chemistry in the Uni versity of Kansas PROFESSOR KARL PEARSON FRS has been appointed to be the first occupant of the chair of eugenics in the University of London es tablished by the legacy bequeathed for that purpose by the late Sir Francis Galton DR ERHARD SCHMIDT professor of mathe matics at Erlangen has been called to Breslau DISCUSSION AND CORRESPONDENCE THE AIR WE BRrATHE IN BUILDINGS To THE EDITOR OF SCIENCE In a recent num ber of SCIENCE Dr Gulick asks several ques tions with regard to the behavior of aqueous vapor in the air and particularly as to the reason why air when heated becomes drier All of his questions could be answered by any competent physicist or could be resolved by reference to any good textbook of physics or of meteorology But unfortunately in these days of overspecialization the language is apt to be too technical or in the textbooks the information too scattered to be readily found and comprehended by the general reader Hence the following explanations may be of some use to him and others in a like position There are two popular misconceptions which it is necessary first to dispel To begin with few people seem to understand why water is wet They think moreover that be cause water is wet the same is true of ice and of aqueous vapor Now this is not the case Both ice and aqueous vapor are themselves dry They become wet only when they turn to water ice when it melts aqueous vapor when it condenses Hence of the three water is alone wet and all real moisture is due to the presence of water So dry is aqueous vapor that it will dry any moist object that it comes in contact with just as would superheated steam or a dry gas which in fact are only other names for the same thing Only we give the name superheated steam to the vapor when the temperature and pressure are much above those of the atmosphere as in the case of a steam boiler Of course we must distin guish between the vapor itself which is a true gas dry and transparent and the cloud or mist into which it condenses on issuing from a locomotive Hence it is strictly speaking in correct to talk of the moisture or humidity in the air There never is any moisture or hu midity in the air unless it be such cloud or mist The described fallacy therefore consists in identifying things which are different and distinguishing things which are the same identifying moisture humidity and water vaporand distinguishing watervapor super heated steam and dry gaswhich are the same The second misconception consists in speak ing of the air as moist or dryan error not likely to be dispelled by the language of the textbooks which include sections on the Hygrometric Condition of the Atmosphere Dr Gulick falls victim to this misconception when he seeks to explain the apparent drying of the air on heating as due to some action of the air on the contained moisture Thus he says p 327 that on heating the air from 320 to 700 It appears that one of two things must have happenedeither the heat must have contracted the existing moisture or the capacity of the air for moisture has been vastly increased by the rise in temperature As a matter of fact neither happened and moreover the air had nothing whatever to do with the matter The same thing would have occurred if the air had been entirely absent h naOueous vapor alone present That is to say aqueous vapor which at 32 seemed rela tively moist would become apparently drier if heated to 70 whether the space filled by it were simultaneously occupied by air or not This independence of the substances was first deduced theoretically by Dalton afterwards established experimentally by Regnault at least with a high degree of approximation Hence it is a change in the condition of the aqueous vapor not of the air to which the 150 SCIENCEAUGUST 4 1911 SCIENCE apparent drying is due and it is the nature of this change which I must now endeavor to ex plain I have said that aqueous vapor is always dry How then can it be at times apparently drier than at others The reason is that we judge of the wetness or dryness of a place by the rate at which evaporation occurs therein This depends upon the elevation of the tem perature of the vapor above its dewpoint or that temperature at which it would condense Suppose we had a hollow vessel enclosing a perfect vacuum Now introduce a small amouit of aqueous vapor at 32 temperature The vapor will immediately expand until it fills the whole space and by the heat vibration of its molecules will exert a certain pressure against the sides of the vessel If now we introduce some more vapor the latter will likewise expand and the pressure will be in creased But at 32 the vibrational energy of the molecules is limited If we keep on add ing vapor we shall presently so increase the density that this energy can no longer keep the molecules separate Some of the vapor will condense There is then a maximum density or pressure which so long as the temperature remains at 32 can not be ex ceeded The vapor is then said to be satu rated Suppose when we arrive at this point we raise the temperature to 70 The heat energy of the molecules is thereby increased and we shall find that we can now putinr con siderably more vapor before the limiting den sity and pressure are reached Hence the latter rise with the temperature or what is the same thing the dewpoint or boilingpoint increases with the pressure Now a moist body must be considered as a source of aqueous vapor If such a body is put into our saturated vapor at 32 no evaporation from it will take place If the temperature is raised to 70 the vapor becomes superheated and more vapor is required to saturate it The moist body be comes the source of that vapor Evaporation takes place the more rapidly the greater the degree of superheat or in direct proportion as the amount of vapor actually present is in defect of that required for saturation The ratio of the former to the latter is technically known as the relative humidity Thus the ap parent dryness of a place depends solely upon the condition of the aqueous vapor therein and not at all upon that of the air Whenever air is heated for a building it should be moistened whenever cooled it should be dried This is generally appreci ated but unfortunately the arrangements pro vided are usually inadequate A very consid erable amount of moistening is required The Sturtevant Company however manufactures a heating apparatus in which steam is blown into the hot air current from one of their fans by means of a nozzle which finely atomizes the steam This insures good mixing It is found that with such an apparatus a much lower temperature suffices for comfort and is also more healthful In Europe where the winters are in general moister than ours lower house temperatures are habitual I spent three winters in Italy and can vouch for the fact that when the temperature in my study reached 65 I found it uncomfortably warm A certain Italian lady who considered 55 in her own country a comfortable temper ature and 60 too warm finds 70 in this climate insufficient The fact that air when cooled increases in dampness is much more noticeable It is a serious impediment to the use of refrigerating apparatus for cooling houses Air which at 90 has a relative humidity of only 65 per cent becomes saturated at 70 If air thus cooled were admitted to a room moisture would condense on the walls Such conditions would naturally be very disagreeable Though the above explanations are only a rehash of wellknown principles I hope they may be of some use In return I wish some one would explain to me just what is the danger of the open window Why is a little sneaking draught in the house a source of colds and grippe while a high wind outof doors a pleasure and a benefit This is a problem that has long puzzled me but perhaps it is a foolish question M MOTT SMITH WATERVILLE ME 151

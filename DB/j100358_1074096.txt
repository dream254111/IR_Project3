J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1074096,CURRENT EDUCATIONAL LITERATURE,I244451,THE SCHOOL REVIEW THE COMPILERS OF SELECTIONS FOR MEMORIZING  HAVE AIMED ES PECIALLY AT MAKING A BOOK THAT SHOULD CONTAIN MATTER ADAPTED FOR EACH OF THE THREE GRADES ORDINARILY FOUND IN SCHOOLS PRIMARY IN TERMEDIATE AND HIGH SCHOOL THEIR AIM HAS BEEN TO PRESENT MATTER THAT IS GOOD LITERATURE INCULCATES GOOD MORALS AND TEACHES PATRIOTISM WITH THEIR STATEMENT OF BELIEF THAT WHEN THE CUSTOM OF HAVING DECLAMATIONS IN SCHOOLS DIED OUT SOME THING WAS LOST THAT WAS WELL WORTH SAVING MANY EXPERIENCED TEACHERS WILL HEARTILY AGREE THE SELECTIONS FOR THE PRIMARY GRADES HAVE RECEIVED SPECIAL CARE THE WORK OF TWO SUCH EX PERIENCED EDUCATORS CANNOT FAIL TO BE OF GREAT USEFULNESS IN THIS LINE MISS YONGES BOOK OF GOLDEN DEEDS IS SO WELL AND FAVORABLY KNOWN THAT IT NEEDS NO INTRODUCTION OR COMMENDATION FIRST PRINTED IN THE FAMOUS GOLDEN TREASURY SERIES IT HAS BEEN RE PRINTED BY MESSRS MACMILLAN  CO IN THEIR SCHOOL LIBRARY AS A BOOK FOR SUPPLEMENTARY READING IT IS WORTHY OF A PLACE IN EVERY SUCH COLLECTION THE STORIES OF MORAL AND PERSONAL HEROISM ARE SUCH AS DELIGHT AND INSPIRE YOUNG READERS CURRENT EDUCATIONAL LITERATURE THE TRAINING OF SECONDARY TEACHERS IN GERMANYTHE LON DON JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR DECEMBER PRINTS A LONG PAPER BY MR J J FINDLAY ON PROFESSIONAL TRAINING IN GERMANY WHICH IS TO BE FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER PAPER OF SUGGESTIONS FOR ENGLAND HE SUMMARIZES IN CONVENIENT FORM THE GERMAN REQUIREMENTS AND SHOWS THAT WHAT IS GENERALLY REPORTED AS THE GERMAN STANDARD IS IN REALITY THE MINIMUM AND DOES NOT FULLY REPRESENT THE OPPORTU NITIES OFFERED FOR PEDAGOGICAL STUDY FOR FIFTY YEARS PREVIOUS TO 1890 EVERY SECONDARY TEACHER IN GERMANY HAD TO STUDY FOR FOUR YEARS TO ATTEND A SATISFACTORY NUM BER OF LECTURES TO PASS A PUBLIC EXAMINATION AND THEN TO WORK IN A SCHOOL UNDER A HEADMASTERS DIRECTION FOR A YEAR PROBEJAHR WITHOUT FEE AT THE END OF THIS YEAR IF THE HEADMASTER REPORTED FAVORABLY HE WAS ACCEPTED AS A QUALIFIED TEACHER AND COULD TAKE A POST IF HE COULD GET ONE HE BECAME ENTITLED ALSO TO THE USUAL PRIVILEGES PENSION ETC ENJOYED BY ALL CIVIL SERVANTS IN I890 A SERIOUS CHANGE WAS INTRODUCED INTO PRUSSIA AND INTO SAXEWEIMAR IT WAS FOUND BY EXPERIENCE THAT THE PROBEJAHR DID NOT GIVE THE NECESSARY PRACTICAL TRAINING HENCE THE ESTABLISH MENT OF SOCALLED  GYMNASIAL SEMINARS OR AS WE SHOULD CALL THEM DAY TRAINING CLASSES ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN GRAMMAR SCHOOLS  AT THE REQUEST OF THE MINISTER OF EDUCATION SOME SIXTY SEE BOOKS RECEIVED 56CURRENT EDUCATIONAL LITERATURE HEADMASTERS OF UPPER SCHOOLS VOLUNTEERED TO UNDERTAKE THE TRAIN ING OF YOUNG TEACHERS IN A PROPERLY CONDUCTED SEMINAR WITH CRIT ICISM LESSONS DISCUSSIONS ETC TO QUALIFY FOR THE OFFICE OF OBERLEHRERONE MUST PURSUE THE FOLLOW ING COURSE  I FOUR YEARS STUDY AND ATTENDANCE AT UNIVERSITY LECTURES 2 AN EXAMINATION PARTLY WRITTEN BUT MAINLY ORAL A IN ONE OR MORE SPECIAL BRANCHES OF KNOWLEDGECLASSICS SCIENCE GEOGRAPHY OR THE LIKE THESE MAY BE MULTIPLIED AND MOD IFIED IN MANY DIRECTIONS B IN GENERAL STUDIES WHICH ARE MADE TO INCLUDE PSYCHOLOGY AND ETHICS AND PEDAGOGICS 3 AFTER THIS EXAMINATION A YEAR OF TRAINING IN A COURSE ATTACHED TO A SCHOOL SEMINARJAHR 4 FINALLY A YEAR OF TRIAL IN WHICH THIS TRAINING MAY OR MAY NOT BE CONTINUED PROBEJAHR IF HERETOFORE THE TENDENCY IN GERMAN PROFESSIONAL TRAINING HAS BEEN TOO MUCH TOWARDS THE THEORY THERE IS A FEELING NOW THAT THE TWO YEARS OF PRACTICE ARE NOT ALWAYS NECESSARY A YEAR UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF AN EFFICIENT HEADMASTER COUPLED WITH THE STUDY REQUIRED AND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR BOTH SEEING AND TAKING PART IN CLASS WORK SHOULD RENDER THE PROBEJAHR UNNECESSARY MR FINDLAY DESCRIBES AT SOME LENGTH THE METHODS FOLLOWED AT JENA AT HALLE AND AT GIESSEN IN TEACHING GENERAL PEDAGOGICS AS DISTINGUISHED FROM THE PRACTICAL WORK OF THE SEMNINARJAHR AND THE PROBEJAHR THE WORK THOUGH LARGELY THEORETICAL IS PRACTICAL IN THAT STUDENTS OBSERVE AND CRITICISE ACTUAL TEACHING IN REAL SCHOOLS THE SCHOOLS ARE SMALLOFTEN A PRIVATE PUPIL SUFFICESAND THE FULLEST OPPORTUNITY IS GIVEN FOR DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE HEAD TEACHER AND THE STUDENTTEACHERS BUT AT PRESENT MUCH IN A PRAC TICAL WAY IS EXPECTED FROM THE YEAR OF APPRENTICESHIP FOLLOWING THE UNIVERSITY COURSE  IT IS TOO SOON TO SAY HOW FAR THESE GYMNASIAL SEMINARS ARE LIKELY TO BE ACCEPTED AS A SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM OF SECONDARY TRAINING IN GERMANY BUT THE FACT OF THEIR ESTABLISHMENT IS THE MAIN CONSIDERATION FOR US AT THIS MOMENT J E R WHEREIN POPULAR EDUCATION HAS FAILEDIN THE FORUM FOR DECEMBER PRESIDENT CHARLES W ELIOT POINTS OUT THAT  AT THE END OF TWO GENERATIONS OF SINCERE AND STRENUOUS IF SOMETIMES MISDIRECTED EFFORT  THE LOOKEDFOR RESULTS OF POPULAR EDUCATION HAVE NOT BEEN REALIZED THERE IS A GENERAL DISCONTENT AMONG AIL CLASSES AND PUBLIC HAPPINESS IS THEREBY REPRESSED SKEPTICAL OB SERVERS COMPLAIN THAT FREE EDUCATION IS MADE TO SUBSERVE PERSONAL AND SELFISH ENDS THAT LAWLESS VIOLENCE CONTINUES TO BREAK OUT JUST AS IT DID BEFORE COMMON SCHOOLS WERE THOUGHT OF THAT COR RUPTION IN POLITICS GOES ON UNCHECKED THAT THE  DISTINCTIONS BE TWEEN RICH AND POOR ARE NOT DIMINISHED BUT INTENSIFIED THAT THE HORRIBLE WASTE AND CRUELTY OF WAR ARE NOT ABOLISHED OR EVEN ABATED AND THAT DISHONESTY IN LABOR DISLOYALTY MUTUAL JEALOUSLY AND DISTRUST BETWEEN EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYED HAVE INCREASED 57THE SCHOOL REVIEW THESE INDICTMENTS AGAINST UNIVERSAL EDUCATION AS A CURE FOR ANCIENT WRONGS AND EVILS ARE CERTAINLY FORMIDABLE BUT THEY EX AGGERATE EXISTING EVILS AND LEAVE OUT OF SIGHT GREAT IMPROVEMENTS IN SOCIAL CONDITIONS WHICH THE LAST TWO GENERATIONS HAVE SEEN  BUT UNIVERSAL EDUCATION IS NOT A PANACEA FOR ALL ILLS THERE WAS A TIME WHEN IT WAS HELD THAT A TRUE AND UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED RELIGIOUS BELIEF WOULD BRING WITH IT AN IDEAL STATE OF SOCIETY  THE BELIEF IN THE INFALLIBILITY OF MODERN REPRESENTATIVE INSTITU TIONS AND LATER IN UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE HAS PROVED DELUSIVE  PUBLIC EDUCATION SHOULD MEAN THE SYSTEMATIC TRAINING OF ALL CHILDREN FOR THE DUTIES OF LIFE IF TOO MUCH HAS BEEN EXPECTED THERE IS YET CAUSE FOR THINKING IT HAS FALLEN SHORT OF WHAT MAY JUSTLY BE REQUIRED  LET ME THEREFORE PRESENT HERE IN SOME DETAIL THE MAIN PRO CESSES OR OPERATIONS OF THE MIND WHICH SYSTEMATIC EDUCATION SHOULD DEVELOP AND IMPROVE IN AN INDIVIDUAL IN ORDER TO INCREASE HIS GENERAL INTELLIGENCE AND TRAIN HIS REASONING POWER THE FIRST OF THESE PROCESSES OR OPERATIONS IS OBSERVATION  THAT IS TO SAY THE ALERT INTENT AND ACCURATE USE OF ALL THE SENSES   FOR THE TRAINING OF THIS POWER OF OBSERVATION IT DOES NOT MATTER WHAT SUBJECT THE CHILD STUDIES SO THAT HE STUDIES SOMETHING THOROUGH LY IN AN OBSERVATIONAL METHOD  NEXT IN ORDER IS  THE FUNCTION OF MAKING A CORRECT RECORD OF THINGS OBSERVED THIS IMPLIES A CAREFUL AND CRITICAL USE OF LANGUAGE SPOKEN AND WRITTEN THE NEXT MENTAL FUNCTION IS THE FACULTY OF DRAWING CORRECT IN FERENCES FROM RECORDED OBSERVATIONS    IT IS OFTEN A LONG WAY FROM THE PATENT FACT TO THE JUST INFERENCE FOR CENTURIES THE PHOENICIAN AND ROMAN NAVIGATORS HAD SEEN THE HULLS OF VESSELS DIS APPEARING BELOW THE BLUE HORIZON OF THE MEDITERRANEAN WHILE THEIR SAILS WERE VISIBLE BUT THEY NEVER DREW THE INFERENCE THAT THE EARTH WAS ROUND   FOURTHLY EDUCATION SHOULD CULTIVATE THE POWER OF EXPRESSING ONES THOUGHTS CLEARLY CONCISELY AND COGENTLY THIS POWER IS TO BE PROCURED ONLY BY MUCH PRACTICE IN THE MOTHER TONGUE AND THIS PRACTICE SHOULD MAKE PART OF EVERY CHILDS EDUCATION FROM BEGINNING TO END  IN THE PRIMARY SCHOOLS WHERE NINETY PER CENT OF SCHOOL CHILDREN RECEIVE THEIR ENTIRE TRAINING READING SPELLING WRITING GEOGRA PHY AND ARITHMETIC ARE THE STAPLES OF INSTRUCTION AS COMMONLY TAUGHT THEY TRAIN ONLY THE MEMORY IN THE SECONDARY SCHOOLS FAR TOO MUCH TIME IS GIVEN TO THE STUDY OF LANGUAGES THE ORDINARY TEACHING OF A FOREIGN LANGUAGE LIVING OR DEAD CULTI VATES IN THE PUPIL LITTLE BESIDES MEMORY AND A CURIOUS FACULTY OF ASSIGNING THE FORMATION OF A WORD OR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A PHRASE TO THE RIGHT RULE IN THE GRAMMARA RULE WHICH THE PUPIL MAY OR MAY NOT UNDERSTAND    I NEED NOT SAY THAT THESE SUBJECTS ARE IN THEMSELVES GRAND FIELDS OF KNOWLEDGE AND THAT ANY ONE OF THEM MIGHT FURNISH THE SOLIDEST MENTAL TRAINING IT IS THE WAY THEY ARE USED THAT CONDEMNS THEM 58CURRENT EDUCATIONAL LITERATURE  IF NOW WE RISE TO THE COURSE WHICH SUCCEEDS THAT OF THE HIGH SCHOOL OR ACADEMY THE COLLEGE COURSE WE FIND ESSENTIALY THE SAME CONDITION OF THINGS IN MOST AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS THE CULTIVATION OF THE MEMORY PREDOMINATES THAT OF THE OBSERVING INFERRING AND REASONING FACULTIES IS SUBORDINATED STRANGEST OF ALL FROM BOTTOM TO TOP OF THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM THE ART OF EX PRESSING ONES THOUGHT CLEARLY AND VIGOROUSLY IN THE MOTHER TONGUE RECEIVES COMPARATIVELY LITTLE ATTENTION  WHAT THEN ARE THE CHANGES IN THE COURSE OF POPULAR EDUCA TION WHICH WE MUST STRIVE AFTER IF WE WOULD DEVELOP FOR THE FILTURE MORE SUCCESSFULLY THAN IN THE PAST THE RATIONALITY OF THE POPULATION  INTHE FIRST PLACE WE MUST MAKE PRACTICE IN THINK ING OR IN OTHER WORDS THE STRENGTHING OF REASONING POWER THE CONSTANT OBJECT OF ALL TEACHING FROM INFANCY TO ADULT AGE NO MATTER WHAT MAY BE THE SUBJECT OF INSTRUCTION    ONE PUPIL CAN BE INDUCED MOST EASILY TO EXERCISE STRENUOUSLY HIS POWERS OF OBSERVATION AND DISCRIMMINATION ON THE FACTS OF A LANGUAGE NEW TO HIM ANOTHER ON THE PHENOMENA OF PLANT LIFE AND ANOTHER ON THE EVENTS OF SOME HISTORICAL PERIOD  BUT FROM THE KINDERGARTEN THROUGH THE UNIVERSITY THERE SHOULD PREVAIL SUCH STUDIES AS WILL ENABLE THE LEARNER TO THINK MORE WISELY OF THE CONDITIONS OF HIS DAILY LIFE AND TO DRAW SOUNDER CONCLUSIONS FROM HIS OBSERVATIONS J E R REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE LENSEIGNEMENT NOVEMBER 1892 NEARLY ONE HALF THE SPACE OF THIS NUMBER IS GIVEN TO A DISSERTA TION ON THE LIFEWORK OF RENAN WHICH THOUGH WHOLLY IN PLACE IN A REVIEW DEVOTED TO SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION HAS NATURALLY OUTSIDE OF FRANCE A LITERARY RATHER THAN A PEDAGOGIC INTEREST THIS CAN NOT BE SAID OF THE ADDRESS DELIVERED BY PROF BROCHARD AT THE SORBONNE TO THE STUDENTS IN THE FACULTY OF LETTERS AT THE OPENING OF THE COURSES NOV 5TH THIS ADDRESS IS A PLEA FOR A GREATER FREEDOM OF INTELLECTUAL INTERCOURSE AMONG STUDENTS PURSUING AS WELL DIFFERENT AS SIMILAR LINES OF STUDY AND SEEMS TO BE AIMED AT A PRESUMED TENDENCY TO INTELLECTUAL ISOLATION IN THE INTEREST OF ORIGINALITY THE ORATOR URGES THE BENEFITS TO BE GAINED BY THE FREE COMPANIONSHIP OF DIFFERENT UNITS CAPABLE OF PRESERVING EACH ITS OWN INDIVIDUALITY THROUGH THE INSPIRATION OF FRIENDLY DISCUSSION THROUGH KEEN GLANCING CRITICISM PROMPTING TO ADDED REFLECTION ON FAVORITE IDEAS THROUGH HAPPY SUGGESTIONS STRUCK OUT IN ANIMATED CONVERSATION AND THROUGH THE COLLISION OF IDEAS WHEREBY THEIR SOLIDITY IS TESTED THE DANGERS TO ORIGINALITY WHICH ARE FEARED FROM PROMISCUOUS MENTAL COMMERCE ARE CLEVERLY RIDICULED AN ORIGINALITY WHICH COULD SO EASILY BE DESTROYED WOULD BE LITTLE TO BE REGRETTED HUMAN SOULS ARE NOT LIKE PEBBLES WHICH LOSE THEIR SHAPE BY THE ACTION OF THE WAVES THEY CLASH WITH EACH OTHER BUT EACH STILL RETAINS ITS OWN PROPER 59THZE SCHOOL REVIEW FORM BEING ONLY POLISHED BY THE CONTACT FINALLY SIGNALIZING THE GRAVITY OF THE SOCIAL POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS PROBLEMS IN WHOSE SOLUTION THE STUDENTS OF TODAY WILL SOON BE CALLED ON TO BEAR A PART THE PROFESSOR EXHORTS HIS YOUTHFUL HEARERS TO NEGLECT NOTHING WHETHER BY ARDENT STUDY OR BY STUDENT INTERCOURSE  TO SPEED THE TIME WHEN THE IDEAS AND RESOLVES WHICH ARE NOW IN GERM WITHIN THEIR SOULS SHALL TAKE DEFINITE FORM TO RIPEN AND TO FORTIFY THAT YOUTHFUL SPIRIT WHICH IS SOON TO BE THE SOUL OF FRANCE THE REVIEW WHICH FOLLOWS OF THE EDUCATIONAL ARTICLES IN THE GREAT ENCYCLOPEDIA NOW IN COURSE OF PUBLICATION AND FORM ING ALREADY THOUGH UNFINISHED TWENTYEIGHT VOLUMES OF I200 PAGES EACH CLEARLY INDICATES THAT THESE ARTICLES REINFORCED BY DOCUMENTS AND INSPIRED BY A PEDAGOGIC SENSE AS HEALTHY AS IT IS PROGRESSIVE ARE OF A NATURE TO INTEREST AND ENLIGHTEN ALL FRIENDS OF EDUCATION OF THE MATTERS TREATED IN THE CHRONIQUE DE LENSEIGNEMENT THE STATISTICS OF SECONDARY INSTRUCTION IN PRUSSIA FOR THE SCHOOL YEAR I89O91 WILL BE LIKELY TO HAVE THE GREATEST INTEREST TO AMERICAN EDUCATORS AND THEY ARE HERE GIVEN THEY ARE TAKEN FROM THE SEMESTER IN EACH CASE THAT HAD THE LARGEST NUMBER OF TEACHERS AND PUPILS AND REMEMBERING THAT THE POPULATION OF PRUSSIA IS ABOUT 28000O000 THEY MAY BE FOUND USEFUL FOR COMPARISON NO OF NO OF TEACHERS PUPILS GYMNASIEN 4875

ADDRESS OF PROF VON CHRIST AS RECTOR OF MUNICH UNIVERSITY IN THE OCTOBER NUMBER CAN HARDLY FAIL TO IN TEREST ALL WHO ARE ENGAGED IN SECONDARY AND UNIVERSITY INSTRUC TION IT DEALS WITH THE QUESTIONS OF UNIVERSITY METHODS AND OF THE BEST MODES OF INTRODUCING YOUNG MEN TO ORIGINAL WORK BUT MANY OF ITS CONSIDERATIONS ARE EQUALLY PERTINENT TO HIGHER SECOND ARY INSTRUCTION THE BENEFICIAL CHANGES THAT HAVE GRADUALLY TAKEN PLACE IN UNIVERSITY METHODS WITH THE GROWTH OF SUBJECTS OF LIVELY HUMAN INTEREST ARE DESCRIBED AS INTRODUCTORY TO OTHER CHANGES WHICH THE RECTOR THINKS WOULD BE IMPROVEMENTS CHIEF OF THESE CHANGES IS THAT THE CURRENT LECTURE SYSTEM SHOULD BE LARGELY SUPPLEMENTED BY CONFERENCES BY ORAL DISCUSSIONS AND BY THE WRITTEN PRESENTATION OF THE IDEAS THAT STUDENTS HAVE GAINED 60CURRENT EDUCATIONAL LITERATURE OR CONCEIVED AS THE RESULT OF LECTURES IN ALL SUBJECTS THAT ADMIT OF APPLICATION THE STUDENT SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO DO AS WELL AS KNOW AND HENCE SHOULD NOT ONLY BE ENCOURAGED TO DO INDE PENDENT WORK BUT SHOULD RECEIVE WISE DIRECTION IN HIS FIRST EFFORTS THE ADDRESS CLOSES WITH A SKETCH OF THE SEMINARY WORK IN MUNICH S G WILLIAMS IN DECIDED CONTRAST WITH PRESIDENT ELIOTS RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POPULAR EDUCATION IS PROFESSOR PATRICKS ARTICLE IN THE DECEMBER EDUCATIONAL REVIEW THE ONE COMPLAINS THAT MOST OF OUR TEACH ING REQUIRES LITTLE MORE THAN MEMORIZING THE OTHER CLAIMS THAT A CENTURY OF NEGLECT UNDER THE NEW EDUCATIONAL IDEAS SHOWS A LOSS IN THE POWER OF MEMORY SCHOLARS USED TO KNOW WHAT THEY KNEW NOW WHAT THEY KNOW THEY KNOW WHERE TO FIND IN THEIR LIBRARIES MR PATRICK MAINTAINS THAT THE NEW EDUCATION IS ESSENTIALLY THE EDUCATION OF THE CRITIC THE EDUCATED MAN IS A SPECIALIST BUT BY NO MEANS A SCHOLAR  IF WE HAD GOOD MEMORIES WE MIGHT BE SPECIALISTS AND STILL BE SCHOLARS TOO MUCH TIME IS DEVOTED TO RELEARNING WHAT HAS BEEN FORGOTTEN A SMALL INCREMENT OF SUCH WASTED EFFORT WOULD IF JUDICIOUSLY AP PLIED SO TRAIN OUR MEMORIES THAT WHAT WE ONCE LEARN WOULD BE RETAINED HITHERTO WHEN ANY ATTENTION AT ALL HAS BEEN GIVEN TO MEMORYTRAINING IT HAS BEEN INDIRECTLY IN CONNECTION WITH OTHER WORK   ABSOLUTE THOROUGHNESS IN A CERTAIN LIMITED DEFINITE AMOUNT OF MEMORYWORK IS THE THING OF PRIME IMPORT ANCE J E R THE PRIVATE SCHOOLMASTERS OF ENGLAND ARE GETTING VERY NERVOUS OVER THE POSSIBLE REINTRODUCTION AND PASSAGE OF MR ACLANDS BILL RELATIVE TO THE SECONDARY SCHOOLS THEY HAVE FORMED AN AS SOCIATION FOR THE PROTECTION OF THEIR INTERESTS AND THE PRESIDENT MR J VINE MILNE ISSUES IN THE EDUCATIONAL TIMES LONDON A CALL FOR AID HE DECLARES THAT THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION IS UNJUST AND SUPPORTS HIS VIEW BY THIS ARGUMENT  PRIVATE SCHOOLMASTERS HAVE SHOWN IN THE PAST THAT THEY FEAR NO LEGITIMATE COMPETITION BUT NO PROFESSION OR TRADE EITHER CAN HOLD ITS OWN AGAINST RATE SUPPORTED COMPETITORS J E R ENGLANDS PROBLEM IN SECONDARY EDUCATIONTHE EDUCATIONAL TIMES LONDON GIVES A FULL ACCOUNT OF THE SPEECH OF THE RT HON ARTHUR ACLAND M P AT THE OPENING OF A SCHOOL AT BIRMING HAM IT IS OF DECIDED INTEREST IN VIEW OF THE BILL TO PROMOTE SECONDARY EDUCATION IN ENGLAND  WHICH IT IS EXPECTED THAT MR ACLAND WILL INTRODUCE WHEN PARLIAMENT MEETS HE EXPRESSED SATISFACTION THAT THE SCHOOL WAS TO BE FREE  NOTHING SEEMED TO HIM MORE DANGEROUS IN EDUCATION THAN THAT SCHOOLS AS THEY GOT HIGHER BEGAN TO CHARGE FEES THAT MEANT THAT THE FEES BEGAN EXACTLY AT THE MOMENT WHEN PARENTS WANTED ENCOUR AGEMENT TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL AND WHEN FOR THIS PURPOSE FEES IF ANY WERE CHARGED AT ALL SHOULD CEASETHE SCHOOL REVIEW TO BE CHARGED HE WAS GLAD TO SEE THAT IT PROVIDED A DE PARTMENT FOR THE TRAINING OF GIRLS THERE WERE SOME PARTS OF THE COUNTRY SOME ANCIENT SEATS OF LEARNING WHEREHE FEARED BY SOME WHO OUGHT TO KNOW BETTERTHE EDUCATION OF WOMEN WAS LOOKED UPON IN A SOMEWHAT GRUDGING SPIRIT   THE GREAT NEED OF THE PRESENT TIME WAS EFFECTIVE ORGANIZATION OF EDUCATION ABOVE WHAT WAS ORDINARILY CALLED THE ELEMENTARY SPHERE ES PECIALLY IN THE LESS POPULATED DISTRICTS THE GREAT NEED WAS FOR IM PROVED MUNICIPAL ORGANIZATION AND WITH IT PROPER EDUCATIONAL ADVANTAGES HE URGED  MORE EFFECTIVE COOPERATION BETWEEN THE TEACHERS OF ALL CLASSES AND ALSO BETWEEN THEM AND THE GOVERNING BODIES OVER THEM HE POINTED OUT THAT SCOTLAND WALES AND MOST OF THE CONTINENT WERE FAR AHEAD OF ENGLAND IN THESE RE SPECTS THE SECONDARY EDUCATION WAS TO BE A WIDE EDUCATION WITH A WIDE CURRICULUM EMBRACING SCIENCE ART LITERATURE HIS TORY LANGUAGESAS BROAD AND GENEROUS AN EDUCATION AS THEY MIGHT DESIRE BUT WHY SHOULD THE STATE INTERFERE IN MUNICIPAL OR COUNTY AFFAIRS  WELL HE DID NOT WANT TO INTERFERE AT ALL BUT HE WAS NOT SURE THE OPINION WAS NOT GROWING THAT THE STATE HAD A WORK TO DO IN ADVISING IN COUNSELLING IN LETTING ONE PART OF THE COUNTRY KNOW WHAT WAS BEING DONE IN ANOTHER PART WHICH INSTEAD OF INTERFERING WAS ASSISTANCE OF THE BEST AND MOST IM PORTANT KIND THE INTERESTS OF THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS WHICH WERE OF A MORE EXTENSIVE CHARACTER MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO INTERFERE WITH THE ORGANIZED EDUCATION WHICH WAS TO BE BOTH POPULAR AND CHEAP AND AVAILABLE IN ALL THE DIFFERENT DISTRICTS OF THE COUNTRY WHICH REQUIRED IT    IF HE WISHED TO SEE TEACH ERS MORE CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH ONE ANOTHER BY DEGREES UNTIL THEY GOT REAL EDUCATIONAL COUNCILS IN THE GREAT CENTRES AND ULTI MATELY A GREAT EDUCATIONAL COUNCIL AT THE CENTRE IT WAS BECAUSE HE IN HIS TURN WANTED A LITTLE FOSTERING CARE THE GREAT MISTAKE IN THE PAST HAD BEEN THAT THE DEPARTMENTS WHICH WERE SO CON STANTLY ABUSED SAW TOO LITTLE OF THEIR ABUSERS WHAT WAS WANTED WAS THAT THOSE WHO WERE CONSTANTLY ENGAGED IN THE WORK OF EDU CATION SHOULD FROM TIME TO TIME IN SOME METHODICAL MANNER GIVE TO THE AUTHORITIES AT WHITEHALL AND SOUTH KENSINGTON THE BEST ADVICE THEY COULD GIVE IF THE STATE HAD SOMETHING TO DO IN THE WAY OF ADVICE AND COUNSEL HE WAS PERFECTLY CERTAIN ALSO THAT THOSE AT HEADQUARTERS WERE MUCH BETTER FOR VISITS AND ADVICE AND THAT VERY OFTEN THEY DID NOT GET THE VISITS AND ADVICE FROM THOSE MOST FITTED TO ADVISE THEM HE HOPED THE TIME WAS NEAR WHEN THE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AUHORITIES WOULD NOT LOOK UPON THE NATIONAL RE SOURCES AND ON THEMSELVES AS SO MANY SPONGES A CONVENIENT SUMMARY OF THE PRINCIPLES UPON WHICH THE GOUIN METHOD OF TEACHING LANGUAGES IS FOUNDED IS GIVEN IN THE EDUCA TIONAL TIMES AS FOLLOWS THAT LANGUAGE IS CHIEFLY CONCERNED WITH THE TONGUE THAT EXERCISES IN LANGUAGE SHOULD BE SENSE NOT 62BOOKS RECEIVED NONSENSE THAT WORDS ARE NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF LAN GUAGE THOUGHTS PRESENTING THEMSELVES IN A SERIES OF MENTAL PICTURES THAT IN THE PROCESS OF ORGANIZATION THE BASIS IS THE VERB AND FINALLY THE PRINCIPLE OF ELIMINATION OF EVERYTHING THAT WAS NOT WITHIN THE RANGE OF IDEAS OF THE PUPILS TO BE INSTRUCTED THE

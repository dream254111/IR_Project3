and points out several other possible errors in Pasteurs de ductions THE UNSEEMLY WRANGLE that has been caused by the Quarterly review article on Mr Edward Gosse has greatly excited the literary men at the universities Whatever be the merits of the case from this distance we can only see that the whole proceeding is derogatory to the dignity of men of literary reputation and culture Journalistic quarrels are usually of no benefit and questionable taste but it would be bad indeed if the outcome of this one should be as one English critic insinu ates to prove that at one university is a profes sor who is not a scholar and at the other one who is not a gentleman THE AMERICANISTS THE sixth session of the Congress international des Americanists was lield in September last at Turin It may not be amiss to say that the pre vious meetings were held at Nancy 1873 Lux emburg 1877 Brussels 1879 Madrid 1881 and Copenhagen 1883 The sixth session would have been held last year had not the cholera pre vented The congress held its meetings in the old chamber in the Carignan palace where the deputies of the Sardinian kingdom held their meet ing while the capital of that kingdom remained at Turin M Desire Charnay opened the real business of the meeting with an address complain ing that too little attention was given in Europe to the study of American history and too much to that of the east I Why said he men care more for the discovery of a finger of Venus or a toe of Mercury than they do for the finding of a whole city in America He instanced especially the apathy with which Maudslays work was re ceived in England saying that it took the direct ors of the Kensington museum three months to make up their minds as to whether they would accept a monolith as a gift The first discussion arose on a paper read by M Guido Cora on the Zeni Brothers The speaker delared that the wellknown map which goes under the name of the Zeni map was the best au thority in the case He recognized the Faroe Islands in Frislanda Iceland in Islanda Green land in Engronelant and portions of North America in Estotiland and Drogeo M Beauvois thought that the Zeni explored Newfoundland while M V Schmidt argued that Engronelant I cJsodE VoL VIln No 201 corresponded to the modern Angramanlant and Norway M Jiminez followed with a very long and de tailed communication on the migrations of the Carib race In his opinion that movement was by the Amazon and Orinoco rivers Then M le Baron de Baye presented a note by the Marquis of Monclar with regard to a trepanned skull from the upper basin of the Amazon and M Pigorini a memoir of M Strobel upon picturewriting of South America M Grossi finally read a paper upon coins of the old and new worlds The next day M Schmidt presented in behalf of Dr H Rink a paper describing the Eskimo tribes of the extreme west and east He gave very detailed statements of the manners customs houses dress social order myths and traditions of those tribes Dr Rink agrees with Captain Hohn that the Eskimos have occupied the coasts of Greenland on all sides A description purporting to have come from Mr A S Gatschet of the ethnological bureau at Washington of the Maya dictionary was then read Without doubt it is of the greatest impor tance in the study of this ancient language and the deciphering of the old inscriptions in that lan guage The dictionary or rather vocabulary forms part of the CarterBrown library in Provi dence The dictionary is in two parts each form ing a small quarto volume Part i contains the MayaSpanish part part ii the SpanishMaya part It was probably composed between 1590 and 1600 It is named after the monastery where the author lived Motul The author is unknown and the copy in question is not the original manu script but a copy According to a somewhat minute calculation it was estimated that the vol ume contained about 15400 terms Others have thought the number higher It gives us the Maya tongue as it existed at the time or shortly after the conquest A vote was passed asking the government of the United States to publish the dictionary at its own expense The congress soon after adjourned after providing for another meet ing at Berlin in 1888 ARCHEOLOGICAL ENIGMAS THE meeting of the Anthropological society of Washington on Nov 16 was devoted to the read ing of two papers bearing on the antiquity of man in America Mr G K Gilbert chief geologist of the U S geological survey described minutely the finding of an ancient hearth on the southern shore of Lake Ontario at the bottom of a well about thirty feet deep The formation at the base of which the hearth was discovered is one of aSCIENCE series of shoredeposits left by the receding ice of the last glacial epoch Mr Gilbert described minutely the manner in which these old beaches were built up by moving gravel one after another by a series of inverted imbrications or overlap pings and relegated the hearth in question to one of the first of them laid down in this particular series roughly estimating the time at about seven thousand years ago Mr Gilbert was followed by Mr W J McGee who described the finding of an obsidian spear head or knife four inches long and beautifully chipped in Walker River Canion Nevada The greatest care was taken in removing this find and all the intelligent forethought which a trained geologist could exercise was used to mark the exact conditions of the case Not the slightest evidence of intrusive burial or bank veneering ap peared and Mr McGee was convinced that the weapon was deposited when the stratum contain 33  i THRESHINGSLEDGE ing it was laid down the time being approxima tively that of Mr Gilberts find Mr John Murdoch reported at the same meeting the discovery of a pair of wooden snowgoggles from the glare of the sun aiid driving snow in a shaft which his party dug at the depth of twenty seven feet below the surface Mr Murdochs dis covery made an interesting connecting link in the interpretation of Mr Gilberts hearth Two of these finds were neolithic of the most advanced type and located at the close of the last glacial epoch they certainly start ten times more questions than they answer The national museum has lately acquired two specimens from different parts of the world Which introduce an element of confusion into archeologi cal speculations Both of them represent the use of stone implements of the very rudest type by peoples above savagery One of these specimenss a tribuluhim or thresh ingsledge from Tunis It is a low sledge or drag made of two planks seventy inches long nineteen inches wide and ten inches thick turned up inches wide and ten inches thick turned up 529 slightly at the front and narrowed like a square toed shoe Three stout battens across the upper side are securely nailed down On the under side just where the flat portion commences are seven teen strips of iron like dull knifeblades ar ranged in two rows quincuncially Along each margin of the under side are four similar dull blades All the remainder of the bottom is occu pied with sixteen rows of stone teeth sixteen in a row arranged quincuncially and projecting about an inch These teeth are nothing but bits of jagged quartz and if picked up independently of their environment would hardly be regarded as wrought by human hands The other paleolithic civilized implement is a Spanish Rallador or grater from British Hon duras It consists of a plank of hard wood eigh teen inches long and ten inches wide into which have been driven nearly two thousand bits of quartz no larger than tiny arrowheads only they are not chipped in the least and are less shapely With such material as the Gilbert hearth the McGee spearhead the Murdoch spectacles the Tunis tribulum and the Honduras grater accumu lating around us every day the question does not seem to be as to the antiquity of man but whether or not archeology will help us in ascertaining his pristine condition on this continent Dismissing the tribulum the stone furniture of one of them would stock an African paleolithic cabinet we have evidence which would satisfy some minds that at the end of the glacial epoch there lived men who built fires chipped obsidian most beauti fully and wore snowgoggles while in the nine teenth century AD men were still in the lowest story of the stone period 0 T MASON THIE HEALTH OF NETW YORK DURING OCTOBER TIIE health department estimates that on the 1st of October the population of the city of New York was 1449958 Of this number 2977 died during the month which was an increase of 210 as compared with September 1275 of these deaths occurred among children under five years of age There was a marked reduction of deaths from diarrhoeal diseases The maximum mor tality from this cause was in the month of July when no less than 1382 deaths took place in August this was reduced to 705 in September to 479 and in October to 234 only about one sixth the mortality of July Fiftyeight more deaths are chargeable to consumption than in the preceding month although the average for October is about that of other months of the year But 18 persons died from scarletfever  a

J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107462,A FEW FACTS RELATIVE TO THE COLOURING MATTERS OF SOME VEGETABLES,I206973, 110 VI A FEW FACTS RELATIVE TO THE COLOURING MATTERS OF SOME VEGE TABLES BY JAMES SMITHSON ESQ F R S READ DECEMBER 18 1817 1 BEGAN A GREAT MANY YEARS AGO SOME RESEARCHES ON THE COLOURING MATTERS OF VEGETABLES FROM THE ENQUIRY BEING TO BE PROSECUTED ONLY AT A PARTICULAR SEASON OF THE YEAR THE GREAT DELICACY OF THE EXPERIMENTS AND THE GREAT CARE REQUIRED IN THEM AND CONSEQUENTLY THE TROUBLE WITH WHICH THEY WERE ATTENDED VERY LITTLE WAS DONE I HAVE NOW NO IDEA OF PUR SUING THE SUBJECT IN DESTROYING LATELY THE MEMORANDUMS OF THE EXPERIMENTS WHICH HAD BEEN MADE A FEW SCATTERED FACTS WERE MET WITH WHICH SEEMED DESERVING OF BEING PRESERVED THEY ARE HERE OFFERED IN HOPES THAT THEY WILL INDUCE SOME OTHER PERSON TO GIVE EXTENSION TO AN INVESTIGATION INTERESTING TO CHEMISTRY AND TO THE ART OF DYING TURNSOL M FOURCROY HAS ADVANCED SOMEWHERE THAT TURNSOL IS ESSENTIALLY OF A RED COLOUR AND THAT IT IS MADE BLUE BY AN ADDITION OF CARBONATE OF SODA TO IT AND HE SAYS THAT HE HAS EXTRACTED THIS SALT FROM THE TURNSOL OF THE SHOPS IF TURNSOL CONTAINED CARBONATE OF SODA ITS INFUSIONS SHOULD PRECIPITATE EARTHS AND METALS FROM ACIDS I DID NOT FIND AN INFUSION OF TURNSOL IN WATER TO HAVE THE LEAST EFFECT ON SOLUTIONS OF MURIATE OF LIME NITRATE OF LEAD MURIATE OF PLATINA OR OXALATE OF POTASHMR SMITHSON ON THE COLOURING C ITS TINCTURES OR INFUSIONS CONSEQUENTLY CONTAIN NEITHER ANY ALKALI NOR ANY LIME NOR PROBABLY ANY ACID EITHER LOOSE OR COMBINED THIS IS UNFAVOURABLE TO THE OPINION OF URINE BEING EMPLOYED IN THE PREPARATION OF TURNSOL I PUT A LITTLE SULPHURIC ACID INTO A TINCTURE OF TURNSOL THEN ADDED CHALK AND HEATED AND THE BLUE COLOUR WAS RESTORED IT APPEARS THEREFORE THAT THE NATURAL COLOUR OF TURNSOL IS NOT RED BUT BLUE SINCE IT IS SUCH WHEN NEITHER DISENGAGED ACID OR ALKALI IS PRESENT NO ADDITION OF CHALK BROUGHT THE COLD LIQUOR BACK TO A BLUE COLOUR THE CARBONIC ACID ABSORBED BY IT DURING THE EFFERVESCENCE OF THE CARBONATE OF LIME BEING SUFFICIENT TO KEEP IT RED SOME TURNSOL WAS PUT INTO DISTILLED VINEGAR AN EFFERVES CENCE AROSE AND AFTER SOME TIME THE ACID WAS BECOME NEU TRALIZED ON EXAMINING THE MIXTURE WITH A GLASS THERE WERE SEEN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE VESSEL A MULTITUDE OF GRAINS LIKE SAND IT WAS FOUND ON TRIAL THAT THESE GRAINS WERE CARBONATE OF LIME PROBABLY OF SLIGHTLY CALCINED CARRARA MARBLE WHEN TURNSOL IS TREATED WITH WATER TILL THIS NO LONGER ACQUIRES ANY COLOUR WHATEVER THE REMAINING INSOLUBLE MATTER IS NEARLY AS BLUE AS AT FIRST ACIDS MADE THIS BLUE INSOLUBLE MATTER RED BUT DID NOT EXTRACT ANY RED TINCTURE CARBONATE OF SODA DID NOT AFFECT IT IF THE VEGETABLE PART OF THIS BLUE RESIDUUM IS BURNED AWAY OR IT IS WASHED OFF WITH WATER A PORTION OF SMALT IS OBTAINED ON EXHALING ON A WATER BATH A TINCTURE OF TURNSOL9 THE LOLOURING MATTER IS LEFT IN A DRY STATE 11IMR SMITHSON ON THE COLOURING THIS MATTER HEATED IN A PLATINA SPOON OVER A CANDLE TUME FIED CONSIDERABLY AS MUCH AS STARCH DOES BECAME BLACK AND SMOKED BUT DID NOT READILY INFLAME NOR DID IT BURN AWAY TILL THE BLOWPIPE WAS APPLIED IT THEN BURNED PRETTY READILY LEAVING A LARGE QUANTITY OF A WHITE SALINE MATTER THIS SALINE MATTER SATURATED BY NITRIC ACID AFFORDED CRYSTALS OF NITRATE OF POTASH AND SOME MINUTE CRYSTALS LIKE HYDROUS SULPHATE OF LIME IS THIS POTASH MERELY THAT PORTION OF THIS MATTER WHICH EXISTS IN ALL VEGETABLE SUBSTANCES  OR IS THE COLOURING MATTER OF TURNSOL A COMPOUND ANALOGOUS TO ULMIN OF A VEGETABLE PRINCIPLE AND POTASH  ITS LOW COMBUSTIBILITY GIVES SOME SANCTION TO THIS IDEA OF THE COLOURING MATTER OF THE VIOLET THE VIOLET IS WELL KNOWN TO BE COLOURED BY A BLUE MATTER WHICH ACIDS CHANGE TO RED AND ALKALIES AND THEIR CARBONATES FIRST TO GREEN AND THEN TO YELLOW THIS SAME MATTER IS THE TINGING PRINCIPLE OF MANY OTHER VEGETABLES  OF SOME IN ITS BLUE STATE OF OTHERS MADE RED BY AN ACID IF THE PETALS OF THE RED ROSE ARE TRITURATED WITH A LITTLE WATER AND CARBONATE OF LIME A BLUE LIQUOR IS OBTAINED ALKA LIS AND SOLUBLE CARBONATES OF ALKALIS RENDER THIS BLUE LIQUOR GREEN AND ACIDS RESTORE ITS RED COLOUR THE COLOURING MATTER OF THE VIOLET EXISTS IN THE PETALS OF RED CLOVER THE RED TIPS OF THOSE OF THE COMMON DAISY OF THE FIELDS OF THE BLUE HYACINTH THE HOLLY HOCK LAVENDER IN THE INNER LEAVES OF THE ARTICHOKE AND IN NUMEROUS OTHER FLOWERS IT LIKEWISE MADE RED BY AN ACID COLOURS THE SKIN OF SEVERAL 11QMATTERS OF SOME VEGETABLES PLUMBS AND I THINK OF THE SCARLET GERANIUM AND OF THE POMEGRANATE TREE THE RED CABBAGE AND THE RIND OF THE LONG RADISH ARE ALSO COLOURED BY THIS PRINCIPLE IT IS REMARKABLE THAT THESE ON BEING MLERELY BRUISED BECOME BLUE AND GIVE A BLUE INFUSION WITH WATER IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE REDDENING ACID IN THESE CASES IS THE CARBONIC AND WHICH ON THE RUPTURE OF THE VESSELS WHICH ENCLOSE IT ESCAPES INTO THE ATMOSPHERE OF SUGARLOAF PAPER THIS PAPER HAS BEEN EMPLOYED BY BERGMAN AS A CHEMICAL INSTRUMENT IAM IGNORANT OF WHAT IT IS COLOURED WITH SULPHURIC MURIATIC NITRIC PHOSPHORIC AND OXALIC ACIDS MAKE IT RED TARTARIC AND CITRIC ACIDS MADE RATHER YELLOW SPOTS THAN RED ONES DISTILLED VINEGAR AND ACID OF AMBER HAD NO EFFECT ON IT CARBONATE OF SODA AND CAUSTIC POTASH DID NOT ALTER THE BLUE COLOUR OF THIS PAPER WATER BOILED ON THIS PAPER ACQUIRED A VINOUS RED COLOUR CARBOINATE OF LIME PUT INTO THIS RED LIQUOR DID NOT AFFECT ITS COLOUR NOR DID CARBONATE OF SODA OR CAUSTIC POTASH CHANGE IT TO BLUE OR GREEN COLD DILUTE SULPHURIC ACID EXTRACTED A STRONG YELLOW TINC TURE FROM THIS BOILED PAPER CARBONATE OF LIME PUT TO THIS YELLOW TINCTURE MADE IT BLUE BUT ON FILTERINGTHE LIQUOR WHICH PASSED WAS OF A DIRTY GREENISH COLOUR AND SULPHURIC ACID DID ROT MAKE IT RED A BLUE MATTER WAS LEFT ON THE FILTER WHICH WAS NOT MADE RED BY ACETOUS ACID BUT WAS SO BY SULPHURIC DCCCXVIII Q 113MR SMITHSON ON THE COLOURING AFTER THIS TREATMENT THE PAPER REMAINED BROWN SEEM INGLY SUCH AS IT WAS BEFORE BEING DYED BLUE IT SHOULD SEEM THAT THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO COLOURING MATTERS IN THIS PAPER ONE RED WHICH IS EXTRICABLE FROM IT BY WATER THE OTHER BLUE WHICH REQUIRES THE AGENCY OF AN ACID TO EX TRACT IT ITS INSOLUBILITY IN WATER AND LOW DEGREE OF SENSIBILITY TO ACIDS DISTINGUISH THE BLUE MATTER FROM TURNSOL TO WHICH ITS NOT BEING AFFECTED BY ALKALIS OTHERWISE MUCH APPROXIMATE IT ITS EASY SOLUBILITY IN DILUTE SULPHURIC ACID AND BEING REDDENED BY IT AND SEVERAL OTHER ACIDS SHOW IT NOT TO BE INDIGO OF THE BLACK MULBERRY THE EXPRESSED JUICE OF THIS FRUIT IS OF A FINE RED COLOUR CAUSTIC POTASH MADE IT GREEN WHICH GRADUALLY BECAME YELLOW CARBONATE OF SODA DID NOT MAKE IT GREEN BUT ONLY BLUE CARBONATE OF AMMONIA CHANGED IT TO A VINOUS RED RATHER THAN TO BLUE AND THIS REDNESS INCREASED ON STANDING CAUSTIC AMMONIA MADE IT BLUER THAN ITS CARBONATE BUT ON STANDING THE MIXTURE BECAME OF THE SAME VINOUS RED THE MULBERRY JUICE MIXED WVITH CARBONATE OF LIME BECAME PURPLE ON FILTERING A RED LIQUOR PASSED AND THE CARBONATE OF LIME LEFT ON THE FILTER WAS BLUE AN ADDITION OF WHITENING TO THE RED FILTERED LIQUOR DID NOT ALTER ITS COLOUR NOR DID THIS SECOND PORTION OF WHITENING BECOME BLUE HEATING DID NOT AFFECT THE RED COLOUR OF THIS LIQUOR SO THAT IT WAS NOT OWING TO CARBONIC ACID DISENGAGED FROM THE CARBONATE OF LIME CAUSTIC POTASH INSTANTLY MADE THIS RED LIQUOR A FINE GREEN AND GRADUALLY YELLOW 114MATTERS OF SOME VEGETABLES SULPHUREI ACID RENDERED ALL THE ABOVE MIXTURES FLORID RED IT IS REMARKABLE THAT THE MIXTURES WITH AMMONIA AND CARBO NATE OF AMMONIA WHICH WERE BECOME QUITE VINOUS RED BY STANDING WERE MADE A PERFECT BLUE BY THE SULPHURIC ACID BEFORE THEY WERE REDDENED BY IT IT WOULD HENCE SEEM THAT THE RED COLOUR CAUSED BY THESE ALKALIS WAS OWING TO AN EXCESS OF THEM AND THAT IN A LESS QUANTITY THEY WOULD HAVE PRODUCED A BLUE THE FILTER INTO WHICH THE MIXTURE OF MULBERRY JUICE AND CHALK LHAD BEEN THROWN WAS BECOME TINGED BLUE WATER DID NOT REMOVE THIS COLOUR SULPHURIC ACID MADE THIS PAPER FLORID RED CAUSTIC POTASH DID NOT ALTER ITS BLUE COLOUR BUT PUT ON THE PLACES IHADE RED BY SULPHURIC ACID IT RESTORED THE BLUE COLOUR BUT DID NOT PRODUCE GREEN FUTURE EXPERIMENTS MUST DECIDE WHETHER THIS BLUE MATTER IS THE SAME AS THAT OF TURNSOL OR AS THE BLUE MATTER WHICH THE EXPIRIMENTS ABOVE HAVE INDICATED IN SUGARLOAF PAPER THE JUICES OF MANY OTHER FRUITS AS BLACK CHERRIES RED CUR RANTS THE SKIN OF THE BERRIES OF THE BUCKTHORN ELDER BERRIES PRIVET BERRIES C SEEM TO BE MADE ONLY BLUE BY MILD FIXED ALKALIS BUT GREEN BY CAUSTIC PUZZLING ANOMALIES HOWEVER OCCASIONALLY PRESENT THEMSELVES WHICH SEEM TO SHOW A NEAR RELATION BETWEEN THE SEVERAL BLUE COLOURING MATTERS OF VEGE TABLES AND THEIR EASY TRANSITION INTO NE ANOTHER THE CORN POPPY THE PETALS OF THE COMMON RED POPPY OF THE FIELDS RUBBED ON PAPER STAIN IT OF A REDDISH PURPLE COLOUR SOLUTION OF CARBONATE OF SODA PUT TO THIS STAIN OCCASIONED BUT LITTLE CHANGE IN IT I 15MR SMITHSON ON THE COLOURING CAUSTIC POTASH MADE IT GREEN CAUSTIC AMMONIA SEEMED NOT TO HAVE MORE EFFECT ON IT TLIAN CARBONATE OF SODA SOME POPPY PETALS BEING BRUISED IN A MIXTURE OF WATER AND MARINE ACID FORMED A FLORID RED SOLUTION A SUPERABUN DANCE OF CHALK ADDED TO THIS RED LIQUOR DID NOT MAKE IT BLUE BUT TURNED IT TO A DARK RED COLOUR EXACTLY LIKE PORT WINE SOME POPPY PETALS BRUISED IN A WEAK SOLUTION OF CARBONATE OF SODA AND THE MIXTURE FILTERED THE LIQUOR WHICH CAME THROUGH WAS NOT AT ALL BLUE BUT OF A DARK RED COLOUR LIKE PORT WINE CAUSTIC POTASH MADE THIS RED LIQUOR GREEN WHICH FINALLY BECAME YELLOW SOME DRIED POPPY PETALS OF THE SHOPS GAVE A STRONG OBSCURE VINOUS TINCTURE TO COLD WATER THIS RED TINCTURE HEATED WITH WHITENING DID NOT ALTER TO BLUE BUT PRESERVED ITS RED COLOUR THESE VERY IMPERFECT EXPERIMENTS MAY PERHAPS SUGGEST THE IDEA THAT THE COLOURING MATTER OF THIS FLOWER IS THE SAME AS THE RED COLOURING MATTER OF THE MULBERRY OF SAP GREEN THE INSPISSATED JUICE OF THE RIPE OR SEMIRIPE BERRIES OF THE BUCKTHORN CONSTITUTE THE PIGMENT CALLED SAP GREEN BY THE FRENCH VERT DE VESSIE THIS SPECIES OF GREEN MATTER IS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FROM THE COMMON GREEN MATTER OF VEGE TABLES IT IS SOLUBLE IN WATER CARBONATE OF SODA AND CAUSTIC POTASH CHANGED THE SOLU TION OF SAP GREEN TO YELLOW PAPER TINGED BY SAP GREEN IS A SENSIBLE TEST OF ALKALISMATTERS OF SOME VEGETABLES SULPHURIC NITRIC AND MARINE ACID MADE IT RED CARBONATE OF LIME ADDED TO A REDDENED SOLUTION RESTORED THE GREEN COLOUR WHICH THEREFORE APPEARS TO BE THE PROPER COLOUR OF THE SUBSTANCE THE GREEN COLOUR WHICH THE LAST INFUSIONS OF GALLS PRESENT APPEARS TO BE DIFFERENT BOTH FROM THE USUAL GREEN OF VEGE TABLES AND FROM SAP GREEN SOME ANIMAL GREENS A GREEN PUCERON OR APHIS BEING CRUSHED ON WHITE PAPER EMITTED A GREEN JUICE WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY MADE YELLOW BY CARBONATE OF POTASH WRONGLY CALLED SUBCARBONATE THERE ARE SMALL GNATS OF A GREEN COLOUR CRUSHED ON PAPER THEY MAKE A GREEN STAIN WHICH IS PERMANENT NEITHER MURIATIC ACID NOR CARBONATE OF SODA ALTERED THIS GREEN COLOUR IT IS CONSEQUENTLY OF A DIFFERENT NATURE FROM THE FOREGOING 117

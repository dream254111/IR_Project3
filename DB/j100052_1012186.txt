J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1012186,EFFECT OF STATE REGULATION OF PUBLIC UTILITIES UPON MUNICIPAL HOME RULE,I242638,EFFECT OF STATE REGULATION OF PUBLIC UTILITIES UPON MUNICIPAL HOME RULE BY J ALLEN SMITH DEAN OF THE GRADUATE SCHOOL UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON THAT SOME FORM OF PUBLIC CONTROL MUST BE EXERCISED OVER THE PRIVATELY OWNED AND OPERATED UTILITIES IN CITIES IS NO LONGER AN OPEN QUESTION IT IS NOW GENERALLY RECOGNIZED THAT PRIVATE CORPORATIONS SUPPLYING SUCH NECESSITIES OF PRESENT DAY URBAN LIFE AS GAS ELECTRIC LIGHT AND POWER TELEPHONE SERVICE AND STREET RAILWAY TRANSPORTATION MUST BE REGULATED BY PUBLIC AUTHORITY IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE AGAINST POOR AND INADEQUATE SERVICE AND EXCESSIVELY HIGH RATES THE ONLY QUESTION ABOUT WHICH WE HAVE NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO REACH AN AGREE MENT PERTAINS TO THE CHOICE OF A REGULATING AGENCY WOULD ADEQUATE REGULATION BE BEST SECURED BY LEAVING THE INITIATIVE IN SUCH MATTERS IN THE HANDS OF THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES DIRECTLY INTERESTED WITH SUCH GENERAL AND SUPERVISORY POWER IN THE STATE GOVERNMENT AS MAY BE DEEMED NECESSARY TO PROTECT ALL INTERESTS INVOLVED OR WOULD IT BE BETTER TO TAKE THIS POWER TO REGULATE ENTIRELY OUT OF THE HANDS OF CITIES AND GIVE TO THE STATE GOVERNMENT EXCLUSIVE CONTROL OVER SUCH LOCAL UTILITIES IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE PRESENT TENDENCY IS STRONGLY IN THE DIRECTION OF EXCLUSIVE STATE REGULATION NO OTHER PROPOSED REFORM IN RECENT YEARS HAS HAD SO MUCH INFLUENTIAL SUPPORT OR ENCOUNTERED SO LITTLE OPPOSITION FROM THE SOURCES WHICH USUALLY OFFER MORE OR LESS DETER MINED AND EFFECTIVE RESISTANCE TO EVERY LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL DESIGNED TO INCREASE POPULAR CONTROL OVER CORPORATIONS OF THIS SORT BUT THE FACT THAT THE CORPORATIONS SUBJECT TO REGULATION FAVOR STATE AS OPPOSED TO CITY CONTROL IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THIS PLAN OF DEALING WITH THE PROB LEM WILL BENEFIT THE PUBLIC IF IT HAS ANY SIGNIFICANCE IT DOUBTLESS MEANS THAT THE REPRESENTATIVES OF SUCH INTERESTS EXPECT LESS EXACTING TREATMENT AT THE HANDS OF THE STATE THAN UNDER A POLICY OF LOCAL CONTROL THE ADVOCACY OF EXCLUSIVE STATE REGULATION IS NOT CONFINED HOW EVER TO THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PUBLIC UTILITY INTERESTS MANY WHO DESIRE EFFECTIVE REGULATION BELIEVE THAT COMPLETE STATE CONTROL 85THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OFFERS THE BEST SOLUTION OF THIS DIFFICULT PROBLEM THIS CONVICTION IS PARTLY DUE TO THE BELIEF THAT CITIES AS MERE LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL UNITS DO NOT HAVE AND CAN NOT BE EXPECTED TO HAVE THE POWERS NEEDED FOR EFFECTIVE CONTROL EVEN WHEN THE PRINCIPLE OF LOCAL SELFGOVERNMENT IS FULLY RECOGNIZED BY THE STATE THE RAMIFICATIONS OF SUCH CORPORATIONS OFTEN EXTEND IT IS SAID BEYOND THE LIMITS OF A GIVEN CITY AND THERE FORE MAKE THE QUESTION OF REGULATION MORE THAN A MERELY LOCAL ONE THAT THIS IS TRUE IN MANY CASES MUST BE ADMITTED IT IS ALSO CLAIMED THAT MUNICIPAL CONTROL OVER THESE MATTERS HAS NOT BEEN A CONSPICUOUS SUCCESS THIS CONTENTION MAY HOWEVER BE ADMITTED WITHOUT CONCURRING IN THE BELIEF THAT EXCLUSIVE STATE CONTROL WOULD BE MORE ADVANTAGEOUS THAN OR EVEN AS ADVANTAGEOUS AS A POLICY UNDER WHICH CITIES EXERCISE SUBSTANTIAL POWERS OF REGULATION THERE ARE OBVIOUS REASONS FOR THE FAILURE OF LOCAL CONTROL IN THE PAST IN THE FIRST PLACE MUNICIPAL AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN TOO MUCH RESTRICTED IN THE EXERCISE OF SUCH POWERS THE FAILURE OF LOCAL REGULATION MUST TO THIS EXTENT BE PLACED WHERE IT PROPERLY BELONGS UPON THE STATE GOV ERNMENT THE ATTITUDE OF BOTH STATE LEGISLATURES AND COURTS HAS NOT BEEN SUCH AS TO GIVE MUCH ENCOURAGEMENT TO THE HOPE THAT EXCLU SIVE STATE CONTROL WILL BE AN ENTIRELY SATISFACTORY SOLUTION ANOTHER REASON FOR THE FAILURE OF LOCAL REGULATION IN THE PAST HAS BEEN THE LACK OF WHAT MAY BE CALLED MUNICIPAL DEMOCRACY CITIES HAVE NOT HAD A FORM OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT ADAPTED TO LOCAL NEEDS THEIR ORGANIZATION FOR GOVERNMENTAL PURPOSES HAS BEEN CUMBERSOME AND NOT DIRECTLY RESPONSIVE TO LOCAL PUBLIC OPINION FOR THIS SITUATION ALSO THE STATE GOVERNMENT IS LARGELY TO BLAME THE PEOPLE OF AMERI CAN CITIES HAVE HAD TO MAKE A LONG AND OFTEN DISCOURAGING FIGHT TO SECURE FROM THE STATE GOVERNMENT PERMISSION TO EXERCISE POWERS NEEDED FOR THEIR PROTECTION AND THE RIGHT TO ADOPT A TYPE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT SUITED TO LOCAL NEEDS IT IS AN INTERESTING COINCIDENCE THAT JUST AT THE TIME WHEN CITIES ARE BEING REORGANIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES A NATIONWIDE MOVEMENT SHOULD BE INAUGURATED TO DEPRIVE THEM OF ALL PARTICIPATION IN THE CONTROL OF LOCAL PUBLIC UTILITIES IT IS ALSO SIG NIFICANT THAT THIS MOVEMENT THOUGH OSTENSIBLY DESIGNED TO GIVE CITIES MORE EFFECTIVE PROTECTION AGAINST PUBLIC UTILITY ABUSES HAS NOT HAD ITS ORIGIN IN ANY POPULAR DEMAND FROM URBAN COMMUNITIES THE INITIA TIVE IN THIS MATTER SEEMS TO HAVE COME VERY LARGELY FROM THE PUBLIC UTILITY INTERESTS 86EFFECT OF STATE REGULATION BUT WHATEVER THE FACTS MAY BE AS TO THE ORIGIN OF THIS MOVEMENT IT CAN HARDLY BE DENIED THAT LOCAL PARTICIPATION IN PUBLIC UTILITY CONTROL HAS NOT HAD SUFFICIENT TRIAL UNDER CONDITIONS AFFORDING A FAIR TEST OF ITS MERITS TO WARRANT THE CONCLUSION WHICH IS IMPLIED IN THE DEMAND FOR EXCLUSIVE STATE CONTROL IF EXPERIENCE IS THE CRITERION BY WHICH WE SHOULD BE GUIDED IN THIS MATTER THERE IS MUCH THAT MIGHT BE SAID AGAINST THE POLICY OF EXCLUSIVE STATE CONTROL EVEN WITH RESPECT TO MATTERS THAT VITALLY CONCERN THE ENTIRE STATE STATE REGULATION HAS NOT BEEN ALWAYS OR EVEN GENERALLY A CONSPICUOUS SUCCESS WHETHER CITIES SHOULD HAVE AN ACTIVE PART IN REGULATING LOCAL PUB LIC UTILITY CORPORATIONS OR WHETHER THIS POWER SHOULD BE LODGED WHOLLY IN THE STATE GOVERNMENT IS A QUESTION THAT SHOULD BE DECIDED IN FAVOR OF THAT AGENCY WHICH SEEMS MOST LIKELY IN VIEW OF ALL THE FACTS AND FORCES INVOLVED TO GUARANTEE ADEQUATE CONTROL IF IT COULD BE SHOWN BY THE ADVOCATES OF EXCLUSIVE STATE CONTROL THAT A STATE COMMISSION IS NOT ONLY BETTER ABLE BUT ALSO AS LIKELY TO EXERCISE ITS POWERS TO SECURE EFFECTIVE REGULATION IN THE INTEREST OF THE LOCAL PUBLIC A STRONG POINT WOULD BE MADE IN FAVOR OF STATE CONTROL NOR COULD CITIES CLAIM UNDER ANY REASONABLE INTERPRETATION OF THE DOCTRINE OF LOCAL SELFGOV ERNMENT THE RIGHT TO EXERCISE A FUNCTION THAT WOULD BE MORE EFFICIENTLY EXERCISED BY THE STATE IT IS NOT HOWEVER MERELY A QUESTION OF PLACING THIS FUNCTION IN THE HANDS OF THAT GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY WHICH HAS MOST POWER AND PRESTIGE BEHIND IT FOR THE POWER TO EXERCISE A PARTICULAR FUNCTION IS OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE UNLESS THERE IS AN ADEQUATE GUARANTEE THAT SUCH POWER WILL BE EXERCISED IN THE INTEREST OF THE LOCAL PUBLIC FOR WHOSE PRO TECTION IT IS DESIGNED HERE IS WHERE WE FIND THE WEAK POINT IN THIS NEW PROGRAM OF EXCLUSIVE STATE CONTROL A STATE APPOINTED COMMIS SION THEORETICALLY RESPONSIBLE TO THE ENTIRE STATE MAY BE AS SATIS FACTORY A DEVICE AS IT IS POSSIBLE TO SECURE FOR THE PURPOSE OF REGULATING UTILITIES IN WHICH THE ENTIRE STATE HAS A DIRECT INTEREST BUT WHEN SUCH A COMMISSION IS CLOTHED WITH THE POWER TO REGULATE UTILITIES THAT ARE PURELY LOCAL IN CHARACTER THIS GUARANTEE IS IN LARGE MEASURE LACK ING A STATE COMMISSION IN EXERCISING THE POWER TO REGULATE LOCAL UTILITIES CAN NOT BE REGARDED AS RESPONSIBLE TO THE STATE IN THE SENSE THAT IT IS RESPONSIBLE WHEN EXERCISING A POWER IN WHICH THE WHOLE STATE IS DIRECTLY AND VITALLY INTERESTED IN THE FORMER CASE THE COMMISSION IS VERY LARGELY IN THE POSITION OF AN IRRESPONSIBLE AUTHORITY THE COMMUNITY OR COMMUNITIES DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY ITS ACTS LACK THE POWER 87THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY TO CONTROL IT IT IS A WELL ESTABLISHED PRINCIPLE OF POLITICAL SCIENCE THAT TO ENSURE AN EFFICIENT EXERCISE OF A GIVEN POWER IT SHOULD BE LODGED IN SOME GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE TO A CON STITUENCY THAT WOULD BE BENEFITED BY HAVING IT ENFORCED IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT EXCLUSIVE STATE CONTROL OF LOCAL UTILITIES FAILS TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF DEMOCRACY IN SO FAR AS IT SUBSTITUTES AN IRRE SPONSIBLE FOR A RESPONSIBLE CONTROL IT STRIKES AT THE FOUNDATION OF THAT ESSENTIAL OF DEMOCRACYLOCAL SELFGOVERNMENT SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS ADVANCED IN SUPPORT OF THIS POLICY OF EXCLUSIVE STATE CONTROL INDICATE AN ATTITUDE OF MIND MORE OR LESS UN FRIENDLY TO MUNICIPAL DEMOCRACY THE SUGGESTION THAT PUBLIC UTILITY CORPORATIONS CAN NOT EXPECT FAIR TREATMENT AT THE HANDS OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES WHICH THEY SERVE IS VIRTUALLY AN ASSERTION THAT THE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF POPULAR GOVERNMENT IS WRONG IF THE PEOPLE OF A LOCAL COMMUNITY ARE TO BE DENIED ALL POWER TO REGULATE LOCAL PUBLIC UTILITY CORPORATIONS MERELY BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE BENEFITED BY EFFECTIVE REGULATION IT WOULD ALSO BE TRUE THAT THE STATE AS A WHOLE SHOULD NOT BE TRUSTED WITH THE POWER TO REGULATE CORPORATIONS IN THE CONTROL OF WHICH THE PEOPLE OF THE ENTIRE STATE ARE INTERESTED THE SAME LINE OF ARGUMENT WOULD DENY TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE POWER TO REGU LATE RAILWAYS AND TRUSTS IT IS IN REALITY A DEMAND THAT THE POWER TO REGULATE IN SO FAR AS IT APPLIES TO LOCAL PUBLIC UTILITIES BE PLACED BE YOND THE CONTROL OF THE LOCAL PUBLIC THE QUESTION MAY PROPERLY BE ASKED IN REPLY TO THIS SUGGESTION WHETHER THE FACTS CONCERNING LOCAL REGULATION SUPPORT THE CONTENTION THAT A LOCAL COMMUNITY SUCH AS A CITY CAN NOT BE DEPENDED UPON TO DEAL JUSTLY WITH ITS PUBLIC UTILITY CORPORATIONS INDEED IT MAY BE SAID THAT IF SUCH POWER AS LOCAL COMMUNITIES HAVE HAD IN THIS RESPECT HAS BEEN UNWISELY EXERCISED THE MISTAKES HAVE BEEN THOSE OF LENIENCY AND UNDUE CONCESSION OF PRIVILEGES RATHER THAN THOSE OF UNJUST AND UNREASONABLE REGULATION BUT EVEN IF LOCAL SENTIMENT SHOULD INSIST UPON UNREASONABLE REGU LATION LOCAL PUBLIC UTILITY CORPORATIONS WOULD NOT BE EXPOSED TO ANY REAL DANGER INASMUCH AS THERE IS ALWAYS AN APPEAL FROM THIS LOCAL AUTHORITY TO THE COURTS JUST WHY SO MUCH EMPHASIS IS PLACED UPON THIS ALLEGED TENDENCY ON THE PART OF A LOCAL REGULATING AGENCY TOWARD UNJUST TREATMENT OF SUCH CORPORATIONS IS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT ITS ACTS ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE THERE IS LITTLE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT A BELIEF THAT OUR STATE SU 88EFFECT OF STATE REGULATION PREME COURTS ARE INCLINED TO UPHOLD ACTS OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES WHICH HAVE THE EFFECT OF UNJUSTLY RESTRICTING THE RIGHTS OF PUBLIC UTILITY COR PORATIONS IN VIEW OF ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES IT IS DIFFICULT TO RESIST THE CONCLUSION THAT PUBLIC UTILITY CORPORATIONS ARE OPPOSED TO THE PAR TICIPATION OF THE LOCAL PUBLIC IN THE EXERCISE OF REGULATION NOT BECAUSE THEY FEAR INJUSTICE BUT RATHER BECAUSE THEY HOPE TO SECURE THROUGH EXCLUSIVE STATE CONTROL ADVANTAGES WHICH IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN IF THE INITIATIVE IN SUCH MATTERS REMAINED WITH ANY AUTHORITY WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE TO LOCAL PUBLIC OPINION ONE FACT WHICH SHOULD BE REFERRED TO IN THIS CONNECTION IS THE DISPROPORTIONATELY SMALL REPRESENTATION IN THE LEGISLATURE GIVEN TO THE LARGE CITIES UNDER SOME OF THE STATE CONSTITUTIONS THIS IS INDICATIVE OF AN ATTITUDE TOWARD THE CITY ON THE PART OF THE STATE WHICH HAS SOME BEARING UPON THE QUESTION OF STATE CONTROL IF A STATE GOVERNMENT IS REALLY IN THE POSITION OF AN IRRESPONSIBLE AUTHORITY WHEN IT EXERCISES A FUNCTION THAT DIRECTLY AFFECTS ONLY THE POPULATION OF A SINGLE CITY THAT IRRESPONSIBILITY IS MADE MORE PRONOUNCED WHEN BY THE CONSTI TUTION OF THE STATE THE CITY IS DENIED ITS PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF REPRE SENTATION IN THE STATE GOVERNMENT IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO SEE WHY PUBLIC UTILITY CORPORATIONS OPERATING UNDER FRANCHISES FROM CITIES SHOULD DESIRE IMMUNITY FROM LOCAL REGU LATION THE PROGRESS WHICH HAS RECENTLY BEEN MADE TOWARD MUNICIPAL DEMOCRACY IS AN INDICATION THAT SUCH POWERS AS MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS ARE ALLOWED TO HAVE WILL BE EXERCISED MORE LARGELY FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE PEOPLE THAN THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST THE EASY INDULGENT ATTITUDE ON THE PART OF IRRESPONSIBLE MUNICIPAL AUTHORITIES WHICH HERETOFORE HAS REDOUNDED SO GREATLY TO THE ADVANTAGE OF PUBLIC UTILITY CORPORATIONS IS GIVING PLACE TO A MORE SOLICITOUS REGARD FOR THE IN TERESTS OF THE MUNICIPAL PUBLIC THE PERIOD HAS NOW PRACTICALLY PASSED WHEN CORPORATIONS CAN SECURE FROM LOCAL AUTHORITIES FRANCHISES WITHOUT PROVISIONS SAFEGUARDING THE RIGHTS OF THE PUBLIC OR EXPECT LAX LOCAL REGULATION HAVING SECURED PRIVILEGES UNDER CONDITIONS SUCH AS THESE IN THE PAST PUBLIC UTILITY CORPORATIONS ARE NOW SEEKING TO EVADE THE CONSE QUENCES OF DEMOCRATIC CONTROL NO GENERAL OPPOSITION ON THE PART OF THESE CORPORATIONS TO LOCAL PARTICIPATION WAS IN EVIDENCE DURING THE TIME THAT MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT WAS AMENABLE TO CORPORATE INFLUENCE IT IS ONLY SINCE THE APPEARANCE OF RESPONSIBLE MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT THAT PUBLIC UTILITY INTERESTS HAVE BEEN SO ACTIVELY OPPOSED TO LOCAL 89THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY REGULATION THIS MAY BE REGARDED AS MERELY ONE MANIFESTATION OF THAT DISAPPROVAL OF LOCAL SELFGOVERNMENT WHICH HAS SO OFTEN FOUND EXPRESSION IN LEGISLATIVE ACTS AND IN COURT DECISIONS IT IS BUT NATURAL THAT THE PRESENT ATTITUDE OF PUBLIC UTILITY CORPORATIONS TOWARD LOCAL REGULATION SHOULD REFLECT TO SOME EXTENT THE OLD DISTRUST OF POPULAR GOVERNMENT EFFICIENT DEMOCRATIC ORGANIZATION NECESSARILY MEANS THE STRICT REGULATION OF SUCH CORPORATIONS WITH THE PROGRESS OF DEMOCRACY IN CITY AND STATE THERE IS LESS OPPORTUNITY THAN HERETOFORE FOR THE DIRECT CONTROL OF POLITICAL AGENCIES BY CORPORATE INTERESTS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THOSE IDENTIFIED WITH THE MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC UTILITIES POPULAR GOVERNMENT IS A DANGER AS REAL AS CLASS GOVERN MENT WAS TO THE MASSES WHEN THE LATTER HAD LITTLE DIRECT VOICE IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS THEY ARE THEREFORE AS MUCH INTERESTED IN LIMITING EFFECTIVE POPULAR CONTROL AS THE PEOPLE WERE FORMERLY IN RESTRICTING CONTROL BY A CLASS IT IS NOT EASY TO ACCOMPLISH THIS HOWEVER BY AN OPEN AND DIRECT ATTACK UPON THE PRINCIPLE OF POPULAR CONTROL AS THE SENTIMENT IN FAVOR OF DEMOCRACY BECOMES MORE INTELLIGENT AND ACTIVE THE EFFORTS TO THWART DEMOCRATIC CONTROL MUST IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THEIR PURPOSE EMPLOY MEANS THAT ARE LESS OBVIOUSLY AT VARIANCE WITH THE PREDOMINANT TENDENCY OF THE TIME IT IS FOR THESE REASONS IN PART AT LEAST THAT SO MUCH IMPETUS HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THE MOVEMENT TO TAKE THE CONTROL OF PUBLIC UTILITIES ENTIRELY OUT OF THE HANDS OF CITIES TO ESTABLISH A PLAUSIBLE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE POLICY ONE WHICH CAN BE RECONCILED WITH THE IDEA OF DEMOCRACY AN ATTEMPT IS MADE TO SHOW THAT LOCAL PARTICIPATION IN SUCH CONTROL RESULTS IN NO REAL BENEFIT TO CITIES THAT THE GREATEST ADVANTAGE TO CITIES THEMSELVES LIES IN THE DIRECTION OF EXCLUSIVE STATE REGULATION BUT BEHIND THIS ARGUMENT AND ONLY PARTIALLY CONCEALED FROM VIEW IS THE FEAR THAT MUNICIPAL CONTROL WILL BE TOO LARGELY EXERCISED FROM THE VIEW POINT OF THE LOCAL PUBLIC AND NOT SUFFICIENTLY REGARDFUL OF THE INTERESTS OF THE CORPORATIONS SUBJECT TO ITS AUTHORITY TO TRANSFER A FUNCTION WHICH IS PROPERLY A LOCAL ONE TO THE STATE GOVERNMENT IS TO MAKE THE EXERCISE OF THAT POWER IRRESPONSIBLE AND TO DEFEAT TO THAT EXTENT THE PURPOSE OF GOVERNMENT BY THE PEOPLE CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THROW SOME LIGHT UPON THE ORIGIN OF THIS MOVEMENT FOR EXCLUSIVE STATE CONTROL IF GENERAL PRICES HAD CONTINUED TO DECLINE AS WAS THE CASE THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD FROM 1873 TO 1897 IT IS UNLIKELY THAT FRANCHISE HOLDING CORPORATIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN INTERESTED TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY NOW ARE IN SECURING IMMUNITY 90EFFECT OF STATE REGULATION FROM LOCAL REGULATION WHEREVER A FRANCHISE FIXES A MAXIMUM PRICE WHICH THE COMPANY MAY CHARGE IT HAS BEEN TREATED AS A CONTRACT UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY HAS THE RIGHT TO CHARGE UP TO THAT AMOUNT FOR SERVICE DURING THE PERIOD THAT GENERAL PRICES WERE DECLINING PUBLIC UTILITY CORPORATIONS OPERATING UNDER FRANCHISES OF THIS SORT WERE IN A PECULIARLY ADVANTAGEOUS POSITION AS AGAINST THE GENERAL PUBLIC THE LEGAL RIGHT TO CHARGE A FIXED PRICE WHILE PRICES IN GENERAL WERE FALLING WAS IN EFFECT THE RIGHT TO AN INCREASING RATE FOR SERVICE BUT WHEN AFTER 1897 THE PURCHASING POWER OF MONEY BEGAN TO DE CREASE THIS ADVANTAGE DISAPPEARED SUCH CORPORATIONS WERE NOW CONFRONTED BY INCREASING COST OF OPERATION ALONG WITH A CHARGE FOR SERVICE WHICH WAS FIXED IN TERMS OF MONEY ONE CAN EASILY SEE THAT IF PRICES SHOULD RISE SUFFICIENTLY SUCH CORPORATIONS MIGHT FIND THEM SELVES IN FINANCIAL STRAITS UNLESS THE EFFECT OF RISING PRICES ON COST OF OPERATION COULD BE OVERCOME BY INCREASE IN THE VOLUME OF BUSINESS OR BY MORE ECONOMICAL AND EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT OF COURSE IT DOES NOT FOLLOW MERELY BECAUSE THE CHARGE FOR SERVICE HAS BEEN AUTOMATICALLY REDUCED THROUGH THE DECREASE IN THE PURCHASING POWER OF MONEY THAT THE PRICE FOR SERVICE AS FIXED IN THE FRANCHISE IS TOO LOW IT MAY STILL BE HIGHER THAN IS SUFFICIENT WITH EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT TO ENSURE A REASON ABLE RETURN ON THE ACTUAL INVESTMENT IT IS TRUE HOWEVER THAT SUCH COMPANIES HAVE LOST A VERY REAL ADVANTAGE THE CHANGE IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAS CONVERTED WHAT WAS IN EFFECT A CONSTANTLY INCREASING CHARGE FOR SERVICE INTO ONE THAT IS NOW DECREASING IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT CORPORATIONS THUS OBLIGATED TO SUPPLY SERVICE ON THE BASIS OF A FIXED MONEY CHARGE SHOULD SEEK SOME MEANS BY WHICH TO AVOID THE CONSEQUENCES OF RISING PRICES IT IS DOUBTLESS LARGELY DUE TO THIS DE SIRE TO SAFEGUARD THEIR INTERESTS THAT THE REPRESENTATIVES OF PUBLIC UTILITY CORPORATIONS ARE SO ACTIVELY PUSHING THE MOVEMENT FOR EXCLUSIVE STATE CONTROL THEY REALIZE THAT CITIES MAY NOT EASILY BE CONVINCED THAT A FRANCHISE PROVISION WHICH PROTECTED THE COMPANY AGAINST RE DUCTION IN THE PRICE FOR SERVICE WHEN ALL OTHER PRICES WERE FALLING SHOULD NOT ALSO PROTECT THE PUBLIC AGAINST AN INCREASE IN THE CHARGE WHEN ALL OTHER PRICES ARE RISING IF THE FRANCHISE IS IN THE NATURE OF A CONTRACT AS HAS BEEN HELD BY THE COURTS THEN BOTH PARTIES ARE ENTITLED TO HAVE IT ENFORCED FOR THEIR PROTECTION IF A PARTICULAR PROVISION IS ENFORCED WHEN IT IS ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE COMPANY AND DISADVANTAGEOUS TO THE PUBLIC THE QUESTION NATURALLY ARISES WHY UNDER CHANGED CONDITIONS IT SHOULD NOT ALSO BE ENFORCED WHEN IT IS ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE PUBLIC 91THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY AND DISADVANTAGEOUS TO THE COMPANY ANY OTHER VIEW OF THE MATTER WOULD JEOPARDIZE THE RIGHTS OF THE LOCAL PUBLIC THERE IS ALTOGETHER TOO MUCH TENDENCY TO REGARD A FRANCHISE AS A CONTRACT ONLY IN SO FAR AS IT PROTECTS THE INTERESTS OF THE GRANTEE INDEED THIS SEEMS TO BE ONE OF THE CHIEF DANGERS OF STATE CONTROL THE PUBLIC UTILITY CORPORA TIONS AT THE SAME TIME THAT THEY ARE SEEKING IMMUNITY FROM MUNICIPAL REGULATION ARE CLAIMING WHATEVER LEGAL RIGHTS AND ADVANTAGES THEY HAVE SECURED FROM LOCAL FRANCHISE GRANTS THERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE ANY INDICATION THAT PUBLIC UTILITY INTERESTS NOW IN FAVOR OF STATE CONTROL ARE WILLING TO RELINQUISH ANY OF THE ADVANTAGES WHICH ARE SE CURED TO THEM BY HAVING A FRANCHISE REGARDED AS A CBNTRACT BUT WHILE RETAINING THESE THEY HOPE TO SECURE RELIEF FROM SUCH FRANCHISE PRO VISIONS AS HAVE BECOME BURDENSOME IT WOULD DOUBTLESS BE TOO MUCH TO EXPECT THAT A RESPONSIBLE MU NICIPAL GOVERNMENT WOULD TAKE KINDLY TO THIS VIEW OF THE MATTER IT IS MORE LIKELY TO ACT ON THE THEORY THAT IF THE FRANCHISE BINDS THE CITY IT ALSO IMPOSES A LIKE OBLIGATION UPON THE COMPANY FOR IN NO RESPECT IS LOCAL CONTROL MORE SENSITIVE TO LOCAL PUBLIC OPINION THAN WHEN IT CON CERNS THE QUESTION OF ADVANCING THE PRICE FOR A PUBLIC UTILITY SERVICE ABOVE THE MAXIMUM FIXED IN THE FRANCHISE A CHANGE SUCH AS THIS IM POSING AS IT WOULD AN ADDITIONAL AND OBVIOUS BURDEN UPON THE PUBLIC COULD NOT SECURE POPULAR APPROVAL UNLESS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE REQUIRED TO ASSUME IT WERE FULLY CONVINCED OF ITS JUSTICE THE MOST SERIOUS OBJECTION TO STATE CONTROL FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF MUNICIPAL HOME RULE IS THE EFFECT IT MAY HAVE UPON PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES THE EFFORTS NOW BEING MADE WHEREVER PUBLIC OWNERSHIP EXISTS TO BRING MUNICIPALLY OWNED PLANTS UNDER STATE CON TROL MAY BE DUE ONLY IN PART TO PUBLIC UTILITY INFLUENCE BUT THEY ARE CERTAINLY IN LINE WITH THE POLITICAL PROGRAM OF THE PUBLIC UTILITY IN TERESTS LET THE STATE DETERMINE THE PRICE TO BE CHARGED FOR SERVICE BY MUNICIPALLY OWNED PLANTS AND PRIVATE CORPORATIONS WILL HAVE LESS TO FEAR FROM PUBLIC OWNERSHIP THIS WOULD BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY OF CHECKING THE INCREASING TENDENCY TO MUNICIPALIZE SUCH INDUSTRIES IT IS NOW TOO SOON AFTER THE INAUGURATION OF THE MOVEMENT FOR EXCLUSIVE STATE CONTROL TO PERMIT ANY SWEEPING CONCLUSION AS TO ITS RESULTS THESE WILL DEPEND UPON THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE URBAN COM MUNITIES WITHIN A STATE CAN MAKE THEIR INFLUENCE FELT IN THE STATE GOV ERNMENT AND ESPECIALLY UPON THE ATTITUDE OF THE JUDICIARY STATE AND FEDERAL TOWARD FRANCHISES AND FRANCHISE LEGISLATION UNLESS THE COURTS 92EFFECT OF STATE REGULATION COMPLETELY ABANDON THE IDEA THAT A FRANCHISE IS A CONTRACT THE NEW POLICY OF EXCLUSIVE STATE CONTROL IS FRAUGHT WITH DANGER TO THE PUBLIC THE POWER TO AUTHORIZE A LOCAL PUBLIC UTILITY CORPORATION TO INCREASE THE RATE CHARGED FOR SERVICE ABOVE THE AMOUNT FIXED IN ITS FRANCHISE IS ONE OVER WHICH SUCH CORPORATIONS WOULD HAVE MOST INFLUENCE WHEN IT IS TAKEN ENTIRELY OUT OF THE HANDS OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND UN LESS THIS POWER TO RAISE RATES IS ALSO ACCOMPANIED BY THE POWER TO RE DUCE THEM BELOW THE MAXIMUM PERMITTED BY THE FRANCHISE CITIES HAVE MUCH TO FEAR AND LITTLE TO GAIN FROM STATE CONTROL BUT EVEN IF EXCLUSIVE STATE CONTROL OF PUBLIC UTILITIES SECURED BET TER AND CHEAPER SERVICE IT WOULD STILL BE A QUESTIONABLE POLICY AN ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE SUCH AS THIS MIGHT BE SECURED AT TOO GREAT A PO LITICAL SACRIFICE THE PROBABLE EFFECT OF STATE CONTROL UPON THE ATTITUDE OF THE PEOPLE TOWARDS AND THEIR INTEREST IN MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT IS OF MUCH MORE CONSEQUENCE THAN ANY POSSIBLE MATERIAL ADVANTAGE THERE IS NO PROBLEM IN WHICH THE PEOPLE OF AMERICAN CITIES ARE MORE ACTIVELY AND VITALLY INTERESTED THAN THAT OF PUBLIC UTILITIES TO TAKE FROM THEM ALL POWER TO DEAL WITH THIS IMPORTANT LOCAL MATTER WOULD NECESSARILY WEAKEN THEIR INTEREST IN MUNICIPAL POLITICS IT IS TOO MUCH TO EXPECT AN ALERT AND ACTIVE GENERAL INTEREST IN MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT UNLESS IT CAN BE USED TO ACCOMPLISH IMPORTANT LOCAL RESULTS THE FAIL URE ON THE PART OF THE STATE TO GRANT CITIES ADEQUATE POWERS OF LOCAL SELFGOVERNMENT HAS BEEN IN NO SMALL DEGREE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE APATHY AND INDIFFERENCE OF THE PUBLIC TOWARDS CORRUPTION AND IN EFFICIENCY THE PROGRESS IN RECENT YEARS TOWARDS MUNICIPAL DEMOCRACY HAS MADE PUBLIC OWNERSHIP A MORE ADVANTAGEOUS METHOD OF DEALING WITH THE PUBLIC UTILITY PROBLEM WITH THE EXTENSION OF MUNICIPAL ACTIVI TIES IN THIS DIRECTION LOCAL GOVERNMENT WOULD ACQUIRE AN IMPORTANCE WHICH IT HAS NOT HAD IN THE PAST THE EFFORT NOW BEING MADE BY PRI VATE CORPORATE INTERESTS TO TIE THE HANDS OF CITIES IN RELATION TO PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES WILL IF IT SUCCEEDS BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE BLOW YET DI RECTED AT THE PRINCIPLE OF MUNICIPAL HOME RULE 93

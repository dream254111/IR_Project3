R S to the Right Honourable Sir Joseph Banks K B P R S c Read February 19 1807 MY DEAR SIR AN extraordinary diversity of opinion appears to have pre vailed among naturalists respecting the production and sub sequent state of the bark of trees According to the theory of MALPIGHI the cortical sub stance which is annually generated derives its origin from the older bark and the interior part of this new substance is annually transmuted into alburnum or sap wood whilst the exterior part becoming dry and lifeless forms the exterior covering or cortex The opinions of GREW do not appear to differ much from those of MALPIGHI  but he conceives the interior bark to con sist of two distinct substances one of which becomes albur num whilst the other remains in the state of bark he how ever supposes the insertments in the wood the utriculi of MALPIGHI and the  tissu cellulaire of Du HAMEL to have originally existed in the bark HALES on the contrary contends that the bark derives its existence from the alburnum and that it does not undergo any subsequent transformation The discoveries of Du HAMEL have thrown much lighto14 Mr KNIGHT on the Formation on the subject but his experiments do not afford any conclu sive result and some of them may be adduced in support of either of the preceding hypotheses and a modern writer MIRBEL has endeavoured to combine and reconcile in some degree the apparently discordant theories of MALPIGHI and HALES He contends with HALES that the alburnum gives existence to the new layer of bark but that this bark subse quently changes into alburnum though not precisely in the manner described by MALPIGII So much difference of opinion amongst men so capable of observing sufficiently evinces the difficulty of the subject they endeavouredto investigate and in a course of experiments which has occupied more than twenty years I have scarcely felt myself prepared till the present time even to give an opinion respecting the manner in which the cortical substance is generated in the ordinary course of its growth or repro duced when that which previously existed has been taken off Du HAMEL has shewn that the bark of some species of trees is readily reproduced when the decorticated surfaceof the alburnum is secluded from the air  and I have repeated similar experiments on the apple the sycamore and other trees with the same result I have also often observed a similar reproduction of bark on the surface of the alburnum of the Wych elm Ulmus montana in shady situations when no covering whatever was applied A glareous fluid as Du HAMEL has stated exudes from the surface of the alburnum this fluid appears to change into a pulpous unorganised mass which subsequently becomes organised and cellular and the  Traite dAnatomie et de Physiologie vegetalesof the Bark of Trees o matter which enters into the composition of this cellular substance is evidently derived from the alburnum These facts are therefore extremely favourable to the theory of HALES but other facts may be adduced which are scarcely consistent with that theory The internal suface of pieces of bark when detached from contact with the alburnum provided they remain united to the tree at their upper ends much more readily generate a new bark than the alburnum does under similar circumstances a similar fluid exudes from the surfaces of both and the same phenomena are observable in both cases The cellular sub stance however which is thus generated though it presents every external appearance of a perfect bark is internally very imperfectly organized and the vessels which contain the true sap in the bark are still wanting and I have found that these may be made by appropriate management to traverse the new cellular substance in almost any direction When I cut off all communication above and on one side between the old bark and that substance I observed that the vessels proceeded across it from the old bark on the other side taking always in a greater or less degree an inclination downwards and when the cellular substance remained united to the bark at its upper end only the vessels descended nearly perpendicularly down it but they did not readily ascend into it when it was connected with the bark at its lower extremity only the result of similar experiments when made on different species of trees was however subject to some variations Pieces of bark of the walnuttree which were two inches MDCCCVII PMr KNIGHT on the Formation broad and four long having been detached from contact with the alburnumexcept at their upper ends and covered with a plaister composed of beeswax and turpentine in some in stances and with clay only in others readily generated the cellular substance of a new bark and between that and the old detached bark very nearly as much alburnum was depo sited as in other parts of the tree where the bark retained its naturalposition which I think affords very decisive evi dence pf the descent of the sap through the bark Similar pieces of bark under the same mode of treatment but united to the tree at their lower ends only did not long remain alive except at their lower extremities  and there a verylittle alburnum only was generated Other pieces of bark of the same dimensions which were laterally united to the tree continued alive almost to their extremities and a considera ble portion of alburnum was generated particularly near their lower edges the sap appearing in its passage across the bark Ito have been given a considerable inclination down wards probably owing to an arrangement in the organiza tion of the bark that I have noticed in a former memoir which renders it better calculated to transmit the sap towards the roots than in any other directiont I have in very few instances been able to make the walnut tree reproduce its bark from the alburnum though under the samI m management I rarely failed to succeed with the syca more and appletree Pieces of the bark of the appletree will also live and generate a small portion of alburnum thoughonly attached to the tree at their lower extremities  Philsophical Transactions of 8o4 1o6of the Bark of Trees probably owing to a small part of the true sap being carried upwards by capillary attraction when the proper action of the cortical vessels is necessarily suspended The preceding experiments and the authority of Du HAMEL having perfectly satisfied me that both the alburnum and bark of trees are capable of generating a new bark or at least of transmittinga fluid capable of generating a cellular substance to which the bark in its more perfectly organized state owes its existence my attention was directed to discover the sources from which this fluid is derived Both the bark andthe alburnum of trees are composed principally of two substances one of which consists of long tubes and the other is cellular and the cellular substance of the barkl is iii con tact with the similar substance in the alburnum and through these I have long suspected the true sap to pass from the vessels of the bark to those of the alburnum The intricate mixture of the cellular and vascular substances long baffled my endeavours to discover from which of them in the pre ceding cases the sap and consequently the new bark pro ceeded but I was ultimately successful The cellular substance both in the alburnum and birk of old pollard oaks often exists in masses of near a line in width and this organization was peculiarly favourable Xt6 my purpose I therefore repeated on the trunks of trees of this kind experiments similar to those above mentioned Which were made on the walnuttree Apparently owing to the small quantity of sap which the old pollard trees contained their bark was very imperfectly reproduced but I observed a fluid to ouze from the cellular  Phil Trans 1805 page 14 P2 107io8 Mr KNTGHT on the Formation substance both of the bark and alburnum and on the sur face of these substances alone in many instances the new bark was reproduced in small detached pieces I have endeavoured to prove in former communications that the true sap of trees acquires those properties which dis tinguish it from the fluid recently absorbed by circulating through the leaf and that it descends down the bark where part of it is employed in generating the new substances annually added to the tree and that the remainder not thus expended passes into the alburnum and there joins the ascending current of sap The cellular substance both of the bark and alburnum has been proved in the preceding experiments to be capable of affording the sap a passage through it and therefore it appears not very improbable that it executes an office similar to that of the anastomosing vessels of the animal economy when the cellular surfaces of the bark and alburnum are in contact with each other and when detached it may be inferred that the passing fluid will exude from both surfaces because almost all the vessels of trees appear to be capable of an inverted action in giving motion to the fluids which they carry As the power of generating a new bark appeared in the preceding cases to exist alike in the sap of the bark and of the alburnum I was anxious to discover how far the fluid which ascends through the central vessels of the succulent annual shoot is endued with similar powers Having there fore made two circular incisions through the bark round the stems of several annual shoots of the vine as early in the summer as the alburnum within them had acquired sufficient  Phil Trans i80o S805 and I8o6of the Bark of Trees og maturity to perform its office of carrying up the sap I took off the bark between these incisions and I abraded the surface of the alburnum to prevent a reproduction of it The albur num in the decorticated spaces soon became externally dry and lifeless and several incisions were then made longitu dinally through it The incisions commenced a little above and extended below the decorticated spaces so that if the sap of the central vessels generated a cellular substance as I concluded it would that substance might come into contact and form a union with the substance of the same kind emitted by the bark above and below The experiment succeeded perfectly and the cellular sub stances generated by the central vessels and the bark soon united and a perfect vascular bark was subsequently formed beneath the alburnum and appeared perfectly to execute the office of that which had been taken off the medulla appeared to be wholly inactive I have already observed that the vessels which were gene rated in the cellular substance on the surface of the alburnum of the sycamore and the appletree traversed that substance in almost every direction and the same thing appears to occur beneath the old bark when united to the alburnum For having attentively examined through every part of the spring and summer the formation of the internal bark and alburnous layer beneath it round the bases of regenerated buds which I had made to spring from smooth spaces on the roots and stems of trees I found every appearance perfectly consistent with the preceding observations A single shoot only was suffered to spring from each root and stem and from the base of this in every instance the cortical vesselsMr KNIGrHT on the Formation dispersed themselves in different directions Some descended perpendicularly downwards whilst others diverged on each side round the alburnum with more or less inclination down wards4 and met on the opposite side of it The same pulpous and cellular substance appeared to cover the surfaces of the bark and alburnum when in contact with each other as wheti detached and through this substance the ramifications of the vessels of the new bark extended themselves appearing to receive their directionfrom the fluid sap which descended from the bark of the young shoots and not to be in any degree influenced in their course by the direction taken by the cortical and alburnous vessels of the preceding year Whenever the vessels of the bark which proceeded from different points met each other an interwoven texture was produced and the alburnum beneath acquired a similar orga nisation and the same thing occurs and is productive of very important effects in the ordinary course of the growth of trees The bark of the principal stem and of every lateral branch contains very numerous vessels which are charged with the descending true sapand at the juncture of the lateral branch with the stem these vessels meet each other A kind of pedestal of aiburnumthe texture of which is much interwoven is in consequence formed round the base of the lateral branch which thus becomes firmly united to the tree This pedestal though apparently a partof the branch derives a large portion of the matter annually added to it from the corticalvessels of the principal stem and thence inthe event of theof thdethof the Iteral branch it always continues to live But it not unfrequently happens that a lateral branh forms a very acute angle with the principal stem and in this case 110of the Bark of Trees  x the bark between them becomes compressed and inactive no pedestal is in consequence formed and the attachment of such a branch to the stem becomes extremely feeble and in secure Instead of the reproduced budsi of the preceding experiment buds were inserted In the foregoing summer or attached by grafting in the spring and when these succeeded though they were in many instances taken from trees of dif ferent species and even of different genera no sensible diffe rence existed in the vessels which appeared to diverge into the bark of the stock from these budsand from those repro duced in the preceding experiments It appears therefore probable that a pulpous organisable mass first derives its matter either from the bark or the alburnum and that this matter subsequently forms the new layer of bark for if the vessels had proceeded as radiclest from the inserted buds or grafts such vessels would have been in some degree different from the natural vessels of the bark of the stocks and it does not appear probable even without referring to the preceding facts that vessels should be extended in a few days by parts successively added to their  The advantages which may be obtained by pruning timber trees judiciously appear to be very little known I have endeavoured to ascertain the practicability of giving to trees such forms as will render their timber more advantageously conver tible to naval or other purposes The success of the experiments on small trees has been complete and the results perfectly consistent in every case with the theory I have endeavoured to support in former memoirs and I am confident that by appro priate management the trunks and branches of growing trees may be moulded into the various forms best adapted to the use of the shipbuilder and that the growth of the trees may at the same time be rendered considerably more rapid without any expense or temporary loss to the proprietor t Darwins Phytologia112 tMr KNIGHT on the Formation extremities from the leaves to the extremities of the roots which are in many instances more than two hundred feet distant from each other I am therefore inclined to believe that as the preceding facts seem to indicate the matter which composes the new bark acquires an organisation cal culated to transmit the true sap towards the roots as that fluid progressively descends from the leaves in the spring but whether the matter which enters into the composition of the new bark be derived from the bark or the alburnum in the ordinary course of the growth of the tree it will be extremely difficult to ascertain It is however no difficult task to prove that the bark does not in all cases spring from the alburnum for many cases may be adduced in which it is always generated previously to the existence of the alburnum beneath it but none I believe in which the external surface of the alburnum exists previ ously to the bark in contact with it except when the cortical substance has been taken off as in the preceding experi ments In the radicle of germinating seeds the cortical ves sels elongate and new portions of bark are successively added to their points many days before any alburnous sub stance is generated in them and in the succulent annual shoot the formation of the bark long precedes that of the alburnum In the radicle the sap appears also evidently to descend through the cortical vesselst and in the succulent annual shoot it as evidently passes up through the central  Phil Trans i805 and 1806 t I wish it to be understood that I exclude in these remarks and in those con tained in my former Memoirs all trees of the palm kind with the organisation of which I am almost wholly unacquaintedof the Bark of Trees vessels which surround the medulla In both cases a cel lular substance similar to that which was generated in the preceding experiments is first formed and this cellular sub stance in the same manner subsequently becomes vascular whence it appears that the true sap or blood of the plant produces similar effects and passes through similar stages of organisation when it flows from different sources and that the power of generating a new bark properly speaking belongs neither to the bark nor alburnum but to a fluid which pervades alike the vessels of both I shall therefore not attempt to decide on the merits of the theory of MALPIGHI or of HALES respecting the repro duction of the interior bark but I cannot by any means admit the hypothesis of MALPIGHI and other naturalists rela tive to the transmutation of bark into alburnum and I propose to state my reasons for rejecting that hypothesis in

j100693,Philosophical Transactions 16651678,100913,Epistle Dedicatory,i206872,TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE ARTHUR EARL of ANGLESEY One of the LORDS of His Majesties most Honourable Privy Counsel c My Lord YOUR Lordships many favours towards me and mine own engagements to record the modern Resuscitations and Advancements of the Philosophical Sciences for which you have alwaies shewd a more than Ordinary propension do in all respects both oblige and encourage me to dedicate this Volume of Philosophical Transactions to your Lordship My Lord it hath been reported that Philosophy and all kinds of polite Literature have commonly retired to the obscurest recesses for shelter from the noise of War and have expired or been almost extin guisht by publick Calamities But these our Generous Philosophers whom I have devoted my services to held out in all the Combustions of our former Wars when our potent Neighbors assaulted us on all sides and when the Pestilence and Fire had wasted our Mother City And they brought in not a few additions of Materials and Aids to all that had been essayd in former Ages or had been invented or pro secuted by the modern enterprizes of those admirable Men our Gil bert Galilaeus our Lord Bacon Peyreske Torricellius  DesCartes Harvey and many others worthy of everlasting monu ments These were bright Stars of the first magnitude yet their great est Designs were lately illustrated enlarged methodized and some way or other improved to more maturity and perfection as may be seen in the History of the RSociety and Sometimes more particu larly in the rude Miscellanies of these Transactions So much have the noblest Arts flourisht amongst us ever since His Majesties most anspicious Restauration partly by the recovery of An tiquities partly by recent aides and successful Inventions even in these roughest times of publick conflicts that it may remain for a suffi cient proof that this Practical Philosophy is not an effeminate or effete  studystudy but efficaciously serviceable under the heaviest incumbrances as well for the defence of our King and Country against hostile Inva sons and Encroachments and for supply of necessaries for life health and strength in War as for Accommodations Elegancies and Ornaments in times of Peace and Prosperity Tis manifest that the Mathematical and Mechanical Arts are no less seasonable in these our Collisions for the skill and security of Navi gation and for Naval Architecture for Engins Fortifications Ar tillery and the modern Tacticks Medicine and Chirurgery for the recovery of decayed health and the healing of lost or wounded limbs Agriculture for sustenance and in remembrance of the old Heroes I may add Martial Music to excite Courage and other Old and New Inventions proper to surnish other advantages Then softer Delicacies are fit for treatments satisfactions and political endearments in the establishment of safe and peaceable Government An Archimedes may as justly diserve applause for his stout defence of Syracusa as Phidias for the tender touches of his Chisel in fashioning the Pour traitures of Jupiter and Minerva And tis by the Intelligent acknowledged That there are at this day a great number of more excellent Artificers in almost all kinds of Works which are deduced from the Ingennous Arts for strength and beauty and for all necessaries and all curiosities than I think mere ever before seen in England and that these Arts coud not have grown so soon to such height if his Majesties extraordinary Magnificence and the Public Exigences had not concurrd to excite almost an Uni versal Industry By the divine conduct immediately after His Maje sties return his Countenance and his own great Example in Repairing and Adorning his Royal Places and in strengthning and increasing his Navy and his Royal Grant of a Charter to establish the Royal So ciety according to Ciceros sentence Honos a lit artes All these en couragements made the way and propard skilful Masters and Guides to survey direct and promote all splendid Structures and Embellish ments which are now so conspicuous in the chief places of this King dom and the abundance of goodly Ships which do now ride in all our navigable Rivers and in all our Seas But I must decline a Task too hard for my pen and too great for my leisure and shall humbly present before your Lordships eye a closer and shorter veiw of some particulars containd in this small Volume Astro nomy and other chief parts of the Mathematicks and a diligent search into the depths of nature into the nature of AnimalsVegetables and all Simples

Tangents for many uses Algebraical additions and a Body of Algebra under hand Music opend Philosophically Mathematically and Practically Opticks gave us the advantage above our Ancestors for the view of things present and at remotest distance Here we are offerd fresh accomp ishments of Opticks and Perspective and a Refle cting Telescope which promi eth and is like to perform more than has hitherto been attained by any approaching Proportion of Measure Light and Colors shew us all the beauty of this our world much hath been done lately with great success to indicate the nature of both be yond

published in this Journal in January 19061 In that article the fluctuation of minimal cutaneous and minimal visual stimuli was discussed The absence of fluctuation for cutaneous stimuli was demon strated by a series of experiments upon a number of observers with liminal pressure and electrical stimuli2 The fluctuation 1C E Ferree An Experimental Examination of the Phenomena usually Attributed

previous results are confirmed On the score of method it may be noted that a very thin narrow strip of highgrade wrapping foil does better service than Christmas tree foil and that the tongue should not be protruded but allowed to lie6o FERRREE of minimal visual stihpuli was explained as a phenomenon of adaptation The thesis was maintained first that adaptation is rendered intermittent chiefly through the influence of invol untary eyemovement and secondly that eyemovement inter feres with adaptation in two ways it reduces the time of stimu lation and by shifting the retina into a region of different stimulation it causes the restoration of the adapted elements The first of the effects just mentioned is obvious but the second demands explanation That eyemovement does restore the adapted retina can in the present state of our knowledge of the phenomenon scarcely be questioned but why a single eyemovement consuming but a fraction of a second or even a group of eyemovements is able to restore a color or bright ness that required a much longer time for adaptation is not readily understood and needs to be investigated Both the fact and its explanation have been the subject of much discussion in the history of visual theories This discussion will be touched upon only briefly It is not our purpose here to give a detailed ac count of visual theories That will be attempted in a later paper The object at this time is briefly to state such phases of visual theory as will be sufficient to introduce our problem We find in general two main types of theory the one represented by Fechner2 Helmholtz8 Fick and Giirber etc called the theory of fatigue and the other represented by Plateau4 Hering5 G E MUiller and others usually called the theory of antag onistic visual processes or when the aftereffect of stimulation is more especially regarded the oscillatory theory naturally upon the floor of the slightly opened mouth with its edges pressing lightly against the lower teeth

eye movement any direct influence upon adaptation As formulated by Plateau 183335 it was primarily intended to explain the occurrence of the positive and negative afterimages the fluc tuation of the negative afterimage and the flight of colors Every light stimulation arouses two processes in the retina the one corresponding to the positive visual impression and the other to the negative afterimage When the eye has been stimulated by light and the stimulus is removed the retina attains to its normal state only after a series of oscillations be tween these opposing processes When the aftereffect of stimulation is observed in an illuminated field of vision the positive phases of the oscillating processes are obscured by the general illumination Hence we have the phenomenon of the negative afterimage and its fluctuation the phases of invisi bility of the negative afterimage corresponding to the recur rence of the obscured positive afterimage When however the observation is made in a darkened field of vision all the changes are noticeable The changes thus observed in after images of certain brightly luminous stimuli have been denomi nated the flight of colors The phenomenon of adaptation was not discussed in this early form of the theory It was taken into account only when the cardinal features of Plateaus theory the antagonistic nature of the visual processes and the oscillatory aftereffect of stimulation were later made the basis of a group of visual theories of which the Hering theory may be taken as the type These theories were called upon to explain not only how the eye becomes adapted to a given stimulus but also how when once adapted it is restored to its normal state In general they account for the restoration of the adapted retina by the conception of antagonistic processes every visual process car ries with it its corrective process All factors extrinsic to the processes themselves are declared to be unimportant It is said e g that the eye does not become permanently adapted to a given set of stimuli or condition of illumination first be cause of the tendency toward correction inhering in the nature of the opposing processes and secondly because the stimula tion of the eye is continually changing owing to changes in position of body and head movement of eyes blinking etc But these latter factors are on no account to be considered as exerting a direct influence on the retinal processes They merely give the corrective tendency inhering in the sets of processes a better chance to operate It will be seen that the above mentioned provision explains the relief of adaptation only in a general way and also inade quately For without taking into consideration extrinsic in62 F1RREE fluences it cannot account for the comparatively large measure of restoration brought about in the short intervals of relief from stimulation afforded by the involuntary eyemovements which occur under the conditions of normal fixation or by voluntary eyemovements of short duration away from the stimulus and back again The intervals are much too short for correction to take place to such a degree of its own accord As these disturbances in adaptation cannot be explained they are denied to be of any considerable importance Invol untary eyemovement under the conditions of normal fixation or voluntary eyemovement away from the stimulus and back again is said to exert no noticeable effect upon the restoration of the adapting stimulus or upon its obverse aspect the nega tive afterimage The interval during which the retina is shifted away from a given stimulus must in point of time alone account for the progress it has made towards regaining its normal condition On the other side however the representatives of the theory of fatigue attribute a direct influence to eyemovement in re storing the stimulated retina to its normal state This influence is inferrpd more particularly from the effect of eyemovement upon th6 negative afterimage The argument is as follows A voluntary eyemovement or a noticeable involuntary eye movement causes the afterimage momentarily to disappear The negative afterimage may be taken as the index of retinal fatigue hence whatever is able thus profoundly to disturb the cause of the afterimage must also function in the recovery of the fatigued retina2 According to Fechner opp citt eyemovement causes the afterimage to disappear because of mechanical disturbances in vascular and nervous influences on the retina temporary vas cular congestion etc Helmholtz says that eyemovement causes the afterimage to disappear by producing changes in the illumination of the retina Both writers apparently have practically disregarded the effect of eyemovement upon the total duration of the afterimage although as will be shown later this must be considered a much more important factor in a study of the restoration of the adapted retina than are the momentary disappearances or fluctuations of the afterimage Of the more recent writers Fick and Giirber contend that eyemovement changes the lymphstream in a way that facili tates the removal of the fatigue products and the delivery of 1 Hering opp citt 8 See especially Pick and Gilrber v Graefes Archiv XXXVI 2 189o 246 8 Physiol Optik 1896 51oINTERMITTENCE OF MINIMAL VISUAL SENSATIONS 63 new material to the fatigued areas Hering1 replying to Fick and Giirber denies to eyemovement any peculiar power to re lieve adaptation He asserts that movement of the field of vision for example answers the purpose equally well Hess op cit contends that an adapted stimulus steadily fixated is not recovered but does not explain how eyemovement re stores the adapted retina Finally MacDougall opp citt explains the effect of eyemovement upon the reappearance of minimal visual stimuli on the basis of innervation This is the condition in which we find the problem at the present time The oscillatory theory makes no provision for any noticeable effect of eyemovement upon adaptation nor can it explain the afterimage results which we ourselves have obtained Fechner and Helmholtz aseribe to eyemovement a direct influence upon adaptation but their hypothesis as to the way in which this effect is produced can be shown to be unten able MacDougalls position has already been discussed by the writer2 while Hering as will be shown later did not carry his observations far enough While however the literature does not furnish a satisfac tory solution of the problem it strongly suggests a method of investigation It is evident that we cannot adequately study recovery while the stimulus is acting We can only note the coincidence of eyemovement or what not with recovery What goes on in the small interval for recovery afforded by a single eyemovement defies observation or experimental analysis Fortunately however the aftereffect of stimulation affords an easy and obvious point of attack Here we can study recovery in isolation and may hope to determine the factors that influence it the factors that cause the fluctuations and affect the duration of the afterimage In accordance with this plan a series of experiments on the negative afterimage was begun in the Cornell University laboratory in the spring of 1904 The results of these experiments will form the sub jectmatter of this and the following papers The material may be classified under the following heads I Relation of the negative afterimage to adaptation II Fluctuation of the negative afterimage III Duration and fluctuation of the negative afterimage with reference to its bearing upon the intermittence of minimal visual stimuli This the logical order of treatment will however be changed for the sake of convenience of discussion The determination 1 v Graefes Archiv XXXVII 3 1891 22 2 This Journal XVII 19o6 89 3 Fick and Giirbers hypothesis although too indefinite and too speculative seems to be the most promising of any of the historical hypotheses It will be discussed later64 FERREE of the relation of the negative afterimage to adaptation de pends in part upon the results of the two succeeding inqui ries and can therefore be most conveniently taken up at the end of the series We shall accordingly begin with a discus sion of the cause of the fluctuation of the afterimage and of the factors influencing its duration In terms of theory these must constitute the factors that work for the restoration of the stimlated retina for whatever theory is held of the adaptation and afterimage phenomenonwhether it be ascribed to fa tigue to antagonism of retinal processes or what notthe factors that work against the afterimage operate to restore the stimu lated retina to its normal condition To make our position more secure however we shall report in a second paper adap tation experiments which show that the experimental varia tions that increase the frequency of fluctuation of the after image and decrease its duration increase the time required for a stimulus to adapt and conversely that the devices that de crease the frequency of fluctuation and increase the duration of the afterimage increase the time required for a stimulus to adapt The tests thus established will then be applied to the fluctuation of liminal stimuli It will be shown that whatever increases the fluctuation of the afterimage and decreases its duration increases the phase of visibility and decreases the phase of invisibility of the liminal stimulus and conversely that whatever decreases the fluctuation of the afterimage and increases its duration decreases the phase of visibility and in creases the phase of invisibility of the liminal stimulus as should be the case if the fluctuation of liminal stimuli is an adaptation phenomenon Thus the chain of identification will be rendered complete The intermittence of minimal visual stimuli will have been made to answer to the tests for adapta tion from both its obverse and its reverse sides Moreover in the progress of the work an answer will be found to the question how eyemovement is able to relieve adaptation The whole course of the work which we have undertaken on the fluctuation of minimal visual stimuli may be summarized as follows First an examination of the phenomenon was made for the ascertainment of its possible causal factors These were found to be disturbances in accommodation adaptation which is found to be intermittent with normal fixation fluc tuation of attention and physiological disturbances in the vis ual centre due to the function of other brain centres such for 1 This result follows directly from the adaptation experiments just referred to For whatever increases the fluctuation and decreases the duration of the negative afterimage increases the time required for a given stimulus to adapt the phase of visibility when the stimulus is liminal and so onINTERMITTENCE OF MINIMAL VISUAL SENSATIONS 65 example as the respiratory and circulatory centres Secondly we eliminated by experimental process all of these factors with the exception of adaptation Thirdly we have been able to identify fluctuation with intermittent adaptation from both its obverse and its reverse sides And fourthly we have deter mined the factors that disturb adaptation II THE FLUCTUATION OF THiE NEGATIVIC AFT1RIMAGEC There is a strong interest in the fluctuation of the negative afterimage independently of its bearing upon our special problem It is generally recognized as one of the important problems in psychological optics and one not as yet adequately taken into account by visual theories We find for example Plateau Aubert Hering Ebbinghaus and others holding that periodicity is grounded in the nature of the afterimage process the followers of Fechner and Helmholtz contending for acci dental influences of various kinds which operate upon the fa tigued retina and Exner maintaining that eyemovement causes the afterimage to disappear because it distracts from clear perception The question then is still open The evi dence is such that unless prejudiced in favor of some particular explanation one cannot subscribe to any without further in vestigation Thus von Kries writing in 19o5 testifies to the lack of decisive results as follows Die Frage ob das Schwin den einer lokalen Umstimmung sich iiberhaupt in dieser Form eines allmlhlichen Abklingens vollziehe ist ohne messende Versuche viel diskutiert und mehrfach in verschiedenem Sinne beantwortet worden 1 i Hering and Exner In our consideration of the various theories those which deny causal relation between eyemovement and fluctuation Herings and Exners will be examined first The hypotheses which seek to explain the effect of eyemovement on fluctua tion Fechners Helmholtz and Fick and Giirbers will be deferred until a later point in the inqniry It is convenient to begin with Hering a Herings discussion of the effect of eyemovement on the fluctuation of the negative afterimage 1891 grew out of a controversy regarding the effect of eyemovement upon the restoration of the fatigued retina to its normal condition In this discussion he has not kept the two subjects formally sep arated so that there must be more or less crossreference be tween them in our review although the centre of interest for us at this stage is the fluctuation of the negative afterimage 1 Nagel Handbuch d Physiol des Menschen III 216 JOURNAL566 FPRREE The whole question of the influence of eyemovement on the visual processes was raised by the representatives of the theory of fatigue They sought to explain first why the eye fatigued by a particular stimulus recovers as quickly as it does and secondly why it does not become progressively fatigued by light stimulation in general during the twelve hours or more of its exposure to light in the course of a day The explana tion was given chiefly in terms of the changes brought about in the fatigued retina by eyemovement As has been stated above p 62 Fechner asserted that these changes are of the nature of mechanical disturbances in vascular and nervous in fluences while Helmholtz attributed them to the more or less continual changes in the illumination of the retina due to eye movement in connection with blinking frowning etc Obvi ously neither hypothesis is adequate to explain the facts in question Fick and Giirber 189o taking up the problem at this point were concerned first to furnish a more extended experi mental demonstration of the fact that eyemovement is effective to relieve the fatigued retina and secondly to explain more adequately than had been done by Fechner and Helmholtz how this relief is accomplished The first point will not be discussed here The explanation may be summarized as fol lows eyemovement restores the fatigued retina by influencing the metabolic changes that take place in the fatigued area it both facilitates the removal of the fatigue products from this area and augments the delivery of new nutrient material to it Replying to Fick and Giirber Hering denies that eyemove ment affects the visual processes and explains the absence of progressive fatigue by his conception of assimilative and dis similative processes which are mutually corrective He bases his denial that eyemovement is a factor in restoring the stimu lated retina to its normal condition upon four experimental proofs all adduced to show that it neither causes the negative afterimage to disappear nor produces any other noticeable dis turbance in its temporal course These four proofs are as fol lows I After continued fixation of a stimulus the after image does not disappear when the eyes are rapidly moved away from the stimulus and back again 2 Movement of the background causes the afterimage to disappear hence eye movement can possess no peculiar power to produce its dis appearance 3 Nearlying afterimages due to successive stimulations do not fluctuate together 4 Eyemovement does not cause the afterimage to disappear when it is observed in a darkened field of vision These points will be taken up in the order given i The demonstration is as follows If a disc or square ofINTERMITTENCE OF MINIMAL VISUAL SENSATIONS 67 dead black paper is laid on a white background and its centre fixated for some time and if the observer then moves his eyes quickly out to some nearlying point and back again to the neighborhood of the stimulus the afterimage is not found to have disappeared as a result of the movement Hering does not draw any specific conclusions from this ex periment alone It will be remembered however that by means of it and of the succeeding experiments he wishes to establish the thesis that eyemovement does not cause the dis appearance of afterimages or otherwise noticeably interfere with their temporal course and that it does not factor in the restoration of the fatigued retina It seems fair to add as an obvious corollary to this thesis that it does not cause the fluctuation of the negative afterimage Now it is evi dent that the experiment is of little or no value in the pres ent connection a For to conclude from it that eyemove ment does not cause afterimages to disappear would be to generalize from a very special case namely from an after image of high intensity The result is very different when the afterimage is weaker eyemovement readily brings less intensive afterimages to disappearance In general after images obtained with so long or even with a less long period of stimulation must dim to some extent the amount depending upon the time of stimulation before eyemovement can cause them to disappear b To conclude from it that eyemove ment does not factor in the restoration of the fatigued retina to its normal condition would be to apply a test that is over strict It is not necessary that the afterimage disappear A dimming of the afterimage should indicate partial restora tion of the fatigued retina In fact the writer has shown in the rough by a series of experiments to be described in a later paper that the restoration of the adapted retina is proportional to the loss of intensity in the afterimage The disappearance of the afterimage corresponds to complete restoration of the adapted retina and should not be required as evidence that partial restoration has taken place To demonstrate then that eyemovement factors in the restoration of the retina it need be shown only that the afterimage has lost in intensity and proof of this is easy however strong the stimulation Observations made with reasonable care give the uniform re sult that afterimages of whatever intensity are dimmed by eyemovement c To conclude from it that eyemovement is not a causal factor in fluctuation would be to ignore certain relevant facts Afterimages of such intensity do not fluctuate Just as they must dim to some degree before voluntary eye movement can cause their disappearance so must they dim before fluctuation begins If therefore the argument from68 FPRREE analogy is to be used at all the investigator must first deter mine at what intensity afterimages begin naturally to fluctu ate and at what intensity voluntary eyemovement of a suitable range begins to cause disappearance and may then ask whether a rough correspondence obtains between the two points This procedure was followed by the writer with a number of obser vers and the results show uniformly an exceedingly close cor respondence A description of the method used and a statement of the results are given further on p 1o3 ff Obviously then nothing can be derived from this experiment that will aid in demonstrating either the Hering thesis or its corollary 2 In his second observation Hering is concerned to dis prove Fick and Giirbers theory that eyemovement facilitates metabolic change in the retina Even if disappearance does follow movement of the eyes he says it is not necessarily im plied that eyemovement possesses any peculiar power to cause disappearance for movement of the background yields the same result The effect of moving the background is ex plained as follows Dies hat seinen Grund in der Wechsel wirkung der Sehfeldstellen und zum Theile auch darin dass die Augenmedien nicht ganz homogen sind und daher immer mehr oder weniger Licht von der Bahn abirrt die wir ihm the oretisch zuschreiben The explanation would seem to give up the whole controversy for as it stands precisely the same effect should be produced by moving the eyes as by moving the background However we let this point pass and pro ceed to consider the statement that movement of the back ground causes disappearance That is true It is possible within limits to duplicate by movement of the background any fluctuation series that may be produced by voluntary eye movement In all such cases however the eye is tempted to movement by the moving background At any rate when the eye is held steady movement of the background does not cause the afterimage to disappear This may be demonstrated as follows a Use for the background the mottled surface presented by the darker side of enginegray cardboard Pro ject the afterimage Let it become sufficiently dim and move the cardboard in any direction Disappearance takes place Now place a fixation point immediately in front of the back ground e g a black knot in a taut vertical white cord Fix ate this steadily Movement of the background scarcely dims the afterimage b The following method is probably not so fair a test of Herings position as that just described since he asserts that a change in the illumination of any part of the retina acts reciprocally on other parts Hence the maximal ef fect would be produced we may suppose by movement of the whole background and not by movement of the particular areaINTrRMITTENC14 OF MINIMAL VISUAL SENSATIONS 69 upon which the afterimage is projected However the facts may speak for themselves Use the same mottled enginegray cardboard for the background Place just in front of it a sheet of same kind of cardboard with a hole of the exact size and shape of the afterimage to be observed Looking through this hole project the afterimage upon the background Move this in any direction Now that the major portion of the field of vision is steady the shifting of the area upon which the afterimage is projected does not noticeably disturb fixation and correspondingly does not cause the afterimage to disap pear Instead of a sheet of cardboard a disc mounted upon a colormixer may be placed behind the opening When the afterimage is projected upon it the disc may be rotated at any chosen rate of speed without sensibly dimming the image 3 Herings third demonstration is as follows Place a short broad strip of colored or dark paper on a white back ground 5 mm to the left of a fixation point Observe for 10 sec Quickly remove it and place a similar strip parallel to the position of the first 5 mm to the right of the fixation point Observe for Io sec Remove this and replace the first strip for o0 sec Then remove the first and replace the second strip for o0 sec Thus the eyes have been exposed to both strips for 20 sec with an intermission for each of 1o sec The object of this arrangement was apparently twofold first by successive stimulation to start the afterimages in different phases of oscillation and thus to cause them to fluctuate suc cessively and secondly by causing them to fluctuate succes sively to show that eyemovement cannot have been responsi ble for their fluctuation but rather that oscillation is grounded in the nature of the visual processes With regard to the first point however it can be shown that there is no especial virtue in successive stimulation to produce successive fluctuation in afterimages situated on different parts of the retina If two stimuli not too large are placed at a certain distance apart and allowed to act simultaneously their afterimages rarely fluctu ate together This is one of the common phenomena of fluc tuation whatever the temporal character of the stimulation and it is in nowise essentially dependent upon successive stim ulations With regard to the second pointthat if eyemove ment had anything to do with the fluctuations the afterimages should have fluctuated together and not independently of each otherwe urge that the conclusion does not by any means follow from the premisses It is true as is pointed out by Hering that both areas of the retina had been stimulated for the same length of time and that so far the afterimages should have been affected alike by eyemovement But Hering overlooks the fact that the one afterimage had been fading for io sec70 FERREE before the stimulus to the other was removed It had thus run a large part of its course before the other began and hence might be expected to disappear under a range of movement that would scarcely dim the other We cannot only say that eyemovement may have been the cause of the independent fluctuation but we can go farther and say that the afterimages behaved precisely as they should have done if eyemovement were the cause of their fluctuation But farther Herings result as well as his conclusion must be called in question The writer has tried the experiment upon himself and a number of observers and so far from find ing Herings results invariable or even typical has rarely met with a case in which after the first couple of fluctuations the one strip disappeared as a whole while the other remained in tact Instead of that the whole area formed by the two broad strips and the narrow contrast strip between fluctuated either as a whole or in parts as all afterimages of a certain magni tude do When the fluctuation was in parts now a corner of the area would drop away now a strip across the top now an irregular patch here followed by an irregular patch there etc etc When the area fluctuated as a whole first the two outside strips would spread over the intermediate space the whole area becoming dim in consequence then the entire image would disappear When observation was made on the closed lids this experiment furnished an excellent demonstration of the relation of the streaming phenomenon to fluctuation Herings arrangement failed to give successive fluctuation for the reason that the strips were too large for their distance apart In this zone of the retina the zone of fluctuation in parts the area included in each disappearance was not large enough to include the whole strip Had the strips been placed farther apart or made smaller and placed as Hering directed the successive fluctuations aimed at would have been uni formly obtained but their occurrence it is plain would in no wise have demonstrated the intrinsically oscillatory character of the underlying visual processes Still better results however would have been obtained if the stimuli had been smaller and also placed farther apart A square or rectangular afterimage large enough to include the stripareas would also have fluctu ated successively in parts the fluctuating area now and then corresponding to or including the two stripareas in turn All these fluctuation phenomena are due to variation in the 1 For a description of this phenomenon see below p 114 and for an explanation of its relation to the afterimage p 123 The stream could be plainly seen to diffuse the color or gray of the two outside strips over the intermediate strip and finally to blot out the whole imageINTERMITTENC0E OF MINIMAL VISUAL SENSATIONS 7I area of the retina involved and have nothing to do with suc cessive stimulation Over a certain range of areas fluctuation in parts is the invariable occurrence whatever the temporal character of the stimulation We may now sum up the discussion of this experiment So far from showing by his special device of successive stimula tions that eyemovement cannot be the cause of fluctuation and so far from throwing any difficulty in the way of the eye movement hypotheses Hering has succeeded rather in making it easier to explain by eyemovement the results which he ob tained In other words he has produced the phenomenon of fluctuation in parts in the only way known to the writer in which it admits of ready explanation by the theories of Fech ner Helmholtz and Fick and Giirber In terms of any eye movement hypothesis the difference in intensity of the two afterimages is amply sufficient to explain why a given eye movement should not affect both of them alike Herings re sults would have been more difficult to explain had he used simultaneous stimulation It is much more difficult e g to say in terms of eyemovement why afterimages of a cer tain area fluctuate in parts or why small afterimages due to simultaneous stimulation of different parts of the retina fluctuate independently of one another The fluctuation in the case both of simultaneous and of successive stimulation is however of the same nature and its cause must evidently be assigned upon other grounds than those here given by Hering 4 As a final step in his argument Hering maintains that in order to a final decision of the question whether eyemove ment exerts any influence upon the disappearance of the after image other than by causing changes in the illumination of the retina the course of the afterimage must be traced in a darkened field of vision He maintains that under these con ditions eyemovement does not noticeably alter the natural course of the afterimage much less cause it to disappear A few sentences further on however he qualifies this statement by the remark that when observing in a darkroom he was never able entirely to blot out an afterimage that was at all distinct or intensive by moving the eyes  In den ersten Paragraphen meiner Mittheilungen zur Lehre vom Lichtsinne habe ich eine Reihe von Erscheinungen besprochen welche man an Nachbildern im geschlossenen und verdunkelten Auge be obachtet Ich hatte bei solchen Versuchen reiche Gelegenheit fest zustellen dass Augenbewegungen den gesetzmiissigen Verlauf dieser Nachbilder gar nicht merklich beeinflussen Auch habe ich zahl reiche Versuche in einem Zimmer angestellt welches vdllstandig ver dunkelt werden konnte nachdem ich mir das Nachbild erzeugt hatte Hier hatte ich den Vortheil die Augenbewegungen bei ebenfalls offenen Augen ausfiihren zu k6nnen Nie war es m6glich ein irgend72 FERR1E4 Apparently there is here a tacit admission that eyemove ment causes weaker or less distinct afterimages to disappear If so the argument against it as a causal factor is materially weakened for as has been stated earlier in the discussion intensive afterimages do not fluctuate at all They must be come sufficiently dim if fluctuation is to set in In any event however observation is the court of final appeal We must determine first whether eyemovement does cause afterimages weak or strong to disappear when they are observed in a darkened field of vision and secondly whether the point at which fluctuation begins roughly coincides with the point at which eyemovement first causes the afterimage to disappear A series of experiments was conducted to this end Many stimuli were used colored and gray and the afterimages were observed under the following conditions with the eyes closed and carefully covered by a black cloth in the darkroom with the eyes both open and closed and in the blackness cylinder In every case eyemovement caused disappearance when the af terimage had become sufficiently dim and this point roughly corresponded with the point at which fluctuation began The following results which are typical have been selected for publication In this case the stimulus was a square of Hering white paper 5 by 5 cm on a background of Hering gray no 31 and the afterimage was observed with the eyes closed and covered with a black cloth Miss Alden a graduate student in psychology in the University of Colorado acted as observer The time of stimulation was 40 sec and the distance of the observer from the stimulus was 75 cm The recording appa ratus consisted of kymograph telegraph key and electromag

from the experimenter It may be well to add that the results showing the closest approxima tion have not been chosen for publication In the case selected too much eyemovement was prescribed The after image began to fluctuate at a greater intensity than in the companion series of natural fluctuations There were more frequent fluctuations and the average phase of visibility was shorter Erring as they do however on the side of making eyemovement too effective these results tell more strongly against Herings assertion that eyemovement does not cause disappearance in a darkened field of vision

bergehend verschwindet sondern dass sich zwischen sein Ver schwinden und eventuelles Wiedererscheinen eine schwache positive Phase einschiebt die freilich oft genug iiberhaupt nicht merklich wird1 It is difficult to determine whether this statement means that the weak positive phase occupies all of what usually passes for the phase of disappearance or only a part of it If it occupies the whole time there is of course no intermission in the afterimage process The disappearance usually observed is merely an artifact produced by observation with the retina illuminated In view of this uncertainty it seemed worth while to repeat the experiments Hering says that the recurrence of the positive phase may be observed if one fixates a bright object on a dark ground for Io 20 or 30 sec and then watches the afterimage in a darkened field of vision A square of white paper on a dark ground was taken as stimulus This gave as negative aftereffect a black square with a distinct contrast border of brilliant white on a very light gray ground The black square fluctuated frequently but there was never left in its place not did there ever appear anything that resembled a square of white or light gray When it disappeared however some part of the contrast border at times remained momentarily visible and often could be seen to 10p cit I874 FERREE reappear slightly in advance of the black squarex but this phe nomenon could scarcely be mistaken for a weak phase of the positive afterimage A small irregular patch of slightly luminous haze is also frequently noticed about the point of regard2 But this occurs just as frequently during a phase of in visibility when the eye has been exposed to a colored or white stimulus or in the darkened field of vision when the retina has undergone no local stimulation at all hence it cannot be a positive aftereffect of stimulation In order to make the testconditions still more favorable to Hering we substituted for the dark gray background pre scribed by him a light gray Hering no 15 Under the original conditions the positive phase must have been difficult to distinguish had it occurred The negative aftereffect now obtained was a black square upon a ground of gray such that not only would the lighter positive phase have been easily dis tinguishable if it occurred but that it would also have been considerably intensified by contrast Still the positive phase could not be detected during the periods of invisibility of the negative phase When the stimulus is luminous Hering says that the positive phases are plainly present alternating with the negative As before two experiments were made upon this point by our ob servers the one with the background light but not so bright as the stimulus and the other with the background dark In the first experiment the suns disc and Colorado daylight served as stimulus and background The bright background intensified the darkened field of vision in the aftereffect and thus as far as brightness was concerned favored by contrast the observation of the positive phase of the afterimage The eye was stimulated probably from I to 3 sec The observa tions were made in mid summer near the middle of the day The sky was cloudless and the light very intensive While now it is difficult to decide what is positive and what nega tive in the color changes that follow exposure to a brightly This of course is merely an instance of fluctuation in parts The area that was swept out by the stream or complex of streams did not at first include this particular part of the contrast border but soon owing to the spread of the area of commotion the contrast border be came involved in the disappearance The reappearance of a part of the border in advance of the remainder of rthe afterimage is a phe nomenon of the reverse order The border was cleared of the stream ing material before the rest of the image 2 Close observation shows this to be a centre of activity of a stream ing area It also occurs but less noticeably in other parts of the field of vision more remote from the point of regard Such patches are usually found to be the foci or places of intersection of narrow swiftly moving streamsINTETRMITTENCR OF MINIMAL VISUAL SENSATIONS 75 luminous stimulus still our observers reported here as in the former experiments unquestionable well defined phases of dis appearance Voluntary eyemovement also produced disap pearance when the afterimage had reached the dimness at which fluctuation begins When exposed to the suns disc the eye was purposely moved in order that the afterimage might be jagged and ir regular This was of some advantage for observation because the limbs of the afterimage owing to their less intensive stim ulation passed through the color changes slightly in advance of the body The afterimage was observed with the eyes closed and covered with a black cloth The following report is typical There was first a momentary lasting over of the stimulus in the body of the afterimage while the edges were a deep red The body then changed to a light blue The red border in the meantime had been gradually extending inwards especially in the limbs of the image1 The edges of the central blue patch next began to change to a yellowgreen While this change was going on the outer mar gin of deep red was encroaching more and more upon the centre When the central portion had become almost entirely yellowgreen the marginal red had taken on a border of deep blue2 All the cen tral portion next became yellowgreen The red border encroached still farther upon the centrejand was in turn encroached upon by its border of dark blue The centre then showed a tendency to become light blue again Finally the whole image became a deep red with a dark blue margin This stage lasted for a comparatively long time and disappearances were frequent Next the dark blue of the margin spread gradually over the entire image There were later a few faint recoveries following disappearances of a lighter blue then came in order a light redviolet a violetblue and a dull dark yellow In these last fainter stages complete disappearances were especially frequent The fluctuations observed in this experiment were not dif ferent from those occurring under the usual conditions The 1At this stage there was a very noticeable effect of perspective The red seemed to be projected farther into the background than the blue farther back even than the general field of vision as if it were sunk or seared into the field The blue seemed a detached and float ing patch which was now and then swept away by a stream changing its shape as it went and dissolving in the stream body 2These changes were not all gradual or continuous Sometimes the central patch would change from light blue to the next stage yellow green and back again at times it would go from blue to the deep red and back to blue again and sometimes it would disappear en tirely frequently repeating in its reappearance all the color stages in their inverse order Sometimes it would come back suddenly to the color from which it fluctuated and very occasionally the order would be irregular These changes were always connected with the streaming phenomenon Light streaming apparently caused the changes from color to color while heavy streaming blotted out the image entirely Recovery came with the clearing away of the streaming material76 FERREE afterimage fluctuated as a whole and in parts as all after images do Now one of the limbs would drop off now the lower part now the upper now the image would disappear across the centre and again it would disappear completely In fact this experiment so far from furnishing evidence against fluctuation gives owing to the long duration of the after image an unusually good demonstration of the various phe nomena that characterize fluctuation Experiments were also made with a dark background Here as before observation showed clearly marked periods of disap pearance The intermission was absolutc No part of the in terval was occupied by anything that could be identified with a recurrence of the positive phase at low intensity Further details appear needless as the conditions already described were more favorable than those of the dark ground for the observa tion in question It is logically impossible then to conclude from the forego ing experiments as Hering does that eyemovement is ineffec tive in the disappearance of the afterimage or that fluctuation is merely the alternation of negative with weak positive phases of the afterimage It is obvious rather that eyemovement is able to cause the diappearance of any afterimage that will fluctuate b Exner argues against the view that intermittence is grounded in the nature of the afterimage process It is a well known fact he says that eyemovement will cause an afterim age to disappear Nor does eyemovement affect the afterimage process The eye moving in some particular direction causes the field of vision to travel across the retina in the opposite direction This moving field of vision by distracting from the perception of the afterimage which is stationary upon the re tina causes it to drop out of clear consciousness When the eye comes to rest the distraction is removed and the after image reappears Now this explanation accounts at best only for our inability to see the afterimage while the field of IExner and Hering thus agree though from different points of view that there is no particular virtue in eyemovement to cause the disap pearance of the afterimage Movement of the background works just as well It is worthy of notice however that while Hering uses the statement as an argument for the oscillatory theory Exner uses it as an argument against Exner thinks it evident that movement of the visual field distracts from the clear perception of the afterimage just as it distracts from the clear perception of objects actually in the external visual field and explains the whole effect of movement of the background in this way It is an easy step then to infer that the disappearances produced by voluntary eyemovement are to be similarly explained and to refer the fluctuations occurring under the conditions of normal fixation to involuntary eyemovement rather than to oscillation of visual processesINTERMITTENCE OF MINIMAL VISUAL SENSATIONS 77 vision is in motion It does not account for the invisibility of the image after the eye has come to rest There are how ever two cases of this inability to see the afterimage while the field of vision is in motion In the one the afterimage is vaguely seen throughout but cannot be seen clearly so long as the eye is in rapid movement It comes out at once when the motion lags or ceases This corresponds to Exners distraction phenomenon but it is not what is ordinarily meant by disappearance The other is a case of true disappearance The afterimage goes out absolutely It does not reappear as the motion lags and is still invisible after the eye has ac curately regained its fixation In the writers experiments upon fluctuations produced by voluntary eyemovement a dis appearance was not recorded unless the afterimage remained invisible after the observer had accurately regained his fixation Disappearances of this sort were evidently not due to distrac tion for distraction had ceased before the record began Although Exner thus seems to be mistaken in his view of the disappearance produced by eyemovement his theory will be put to experimental test A direct corollary from it is that the effect of eyemovement upon the disappearance of the afterimage bears an inverse relation to the uniformity of the projection field There are three sets of conditions under which this relation should obtain a disappearance under the conditions of ordinary fixation b disappearance produced by voluntary eyemovement and c disappearance caused by movement of the background It certainly does not obtain under the first conditions The afterimage fluctuates with equal readiness when projected upon lettered surfaces upon mottled enginegray cardboard upon either the dull or the glazed surface of milk glass than which there is probably no more uniform background and upon the Hering gray papers Nor does it seem to make any difference which of the above backgrounds is used when the disappearance is caused by vol untary eyemovement The inverse relation does however seem to hold within limits when the disappearances are caused by movement of the background the mottled backgrounds have apparently more effect than the uniform Now it is evident that the mottled background travelling across the retina could distract no more from the perception of the after image in this case than in the other two It would however in proportion to its irregularity distract from steady fixation Thus the difference is to be explained in terms of increased eyemovement and again the argument against eyemovement upon more careful investigation is converted into an argument for some sort of eyemovement hypothesis As the matter stands then with regard to Hering and Ex78 FICRR4EE ner eyemovement must still be taken into account in the explanation of the fluctuation of the negative afterimage ii Demonstration of causal connection between eyemovement and fluctuation as against the theory of intrinsic oscillation a Results in generalIn order that the thread of the ar gument may not be lost in the tables and details that follow a brief general statement of results is here given i tluctuation occurs only within a limited range of after image areas It is a matter of common laboratory report that fluctuation does not take place in the aftereffect of general adaptation The aftereffect dies away gradually There are none of the intermittent variations of intensity that characterize the aftereffect of local adaptation to stimuli of certain areas This fact is brought out in practically all the recordbooks kept by members of the junior training course at Cornell University Careful tests have also been made with the same result by the help of observers trained to work with just noticeable differ ences by whom even slight variations in intensity would have been noticed We turn to the aftereffect of local adaptation Here we find that fluctuation occurs only within a comparatively limited range of afterimage areas varying somewhat for the different colors used and for different observers Large afterimages do not fluctuate at all small afterimages little if at all after images of mean area alone fluctuate readily If a curve of fre quency were plotted with the areas laid off along the ordinate and the frequency of fluctuation along the abcissa the curve would start close to the abcissa rise gradually until a certain area was reached and then bend down rather more sharply to the abscissa This result is apparently incompatible with the hypothesis of intrinsic oscillation Absence of fluctuation for a single area would tell strongly against that theory and such a range of variation as is expressed in the curve of frequency would seem to condemn it absolutely The shape of the curve of frequency together with the fluctuation in parts of after images of certain areas is the most difficult problem that the fluctuation of the afterimage presents to theory That eye movement acting in cooperation with streaming offers a satis factory explanation of all the variations resulting from change in area will be shown in detail in its proper place 2 Whatever renders fixation unsteady increases the fre quency offluctuation and decreases the duration of the afterimage The converse is also true whatever aids fixation decreases the frequency of fluctuation and increases the duration of the afterimage Various methods were used to disturb and to control fixation In every case records of eyemovement wereINTERMITTENCE OF MINIMAL VISUAL SENSATIONS 79 taken that showed both the range and frequency of the move ments and the total time during which the eyes were in motion A quantitative comparison could thus be instituted between these movements on the one hand and the frequency of fluctua tion on the other The results show a high degree of correla tion 3 The form of the stimulus affects the frequency offluctua tion Experiments were made with squares and with narrow strips of equal area The latter showed a much greater liabil ity to fluctuation This result can hardly be explained on the theory of intrinsic oscillation the oscillatory character of the retinal processes must be sensibly the same within a square as within a narrow oblong area There is however good reason to believe that eyemovement differs in the two cases for when the strip is observed the introspective reports of the observers bear witness to a strong conscious tendency to look towards the ends to see what is happening there The tendency to increased movement with the stripimages is shown also in the eyemovement records Eyemovement then is a factor in the result Another and as we shall see later a very impor tant factor is the retinal distribution of the zones of streaming 4 The arrangement of the stimulus with reference to the direction of greatest eyemovement affects the frequency offluctua tion and the duration of the afterimage A strip afterimage placed with its breadth in the plane of the greater range and frequency of eyemovement fluctuates more frequently and has a shorter duration than in the inverse arrangement The greater frequency of fluctuation is due to the action of the greater amount of eyemovement upon the lesser dimension of the afterimage The point may be demonstrated as follows Let the disappearance be produced by voluntary eyemovement If these movements are in the horizontal plane disappearance is more frequent when the breadth of the strip is in the horizontal than when it is in the vertical plane Conversely if the eye movements are in the vertical plane disappearance is more frequent when the breadth of the strip is in the vertical than when it is in the horizontal plane An explanation will be given in Section iii c Were a periodicity grounded in the nature of the afterimage process extraneous influences like the form and arrangement of the stimulus ought not thus to affect the frequency of fluctuation 5 The results grouped under z 3 and 4 can be roughly duplicated if voluntary eyemovement is brought in to cause fluctuation In the experiments under this heading the same squares were used as in I the same strips and squares as in 3 and the same strips and arrangements with reference to the direction of greatest eyemovement as in 4 The cor8o FERRE respondence in the results of the two series of experiments is extremely high Here then is a strong indication that eye movement is a causal factor in fluctuation Another factor however is required for the complete explanation of the results The methods employed in I and 3 were especially devised to vary the amount of involuntary eyemovement from observa tion to observation Yet their results were approximated by the introduction of voluntary eyemovement the amount of which was kept constant from one observation to another Obviously therefore a second factor is at work which is affected by eyemovement and which in turn acts upon the afterimage A more complete explanation is given later in terms of streaming 6 An increase of the time of stimulation increases the num ber offluctuations of the afterimage The time of stimulation ranged for the different observers from Io to Ioo sec Increase of the time of stimulation brought with it an increase in the intensity of the afterimage an increase in eyemovement shown by the records and an increase in the fluctuation of the afterimage It cannot of course be determined offhand which of the first two variations is the cause of the third From the evidence already at hand it seems probable that eye movement is responsible for the increase of fluctuation More over there is no obvious reason why a more intensive after image on the ground of its intensity alone should begin to fluctuate sooner at a greater intensity or should fluctuate more frequentiy after it does beginas happens uniformly under the present conditions The problem is however capa ble of definite experimental analysis Increase of intensity can be obtained by a method which does not cause an increase of eyemovement namely by increase of the intensity of the stimulus In this case there is no increase of the number of fluctuations We thus have new and positive evidence that eyemovement is a causal factor in fluctuation A long period of fixation increases involuntary eyemovement and this again increases the frequency of fluctuation apparently in the same proportion 7 The observers most sensitive to the methods used to distrib ute fixation showed the widest range of variability of fluctuation and duration The observers ranged from very stable to very sensitive The tables show a variation in results from individ ual to individual corresponding to the differences in sensitiv ity to disturbances of fixation Thus B and A were very sen sitive W much less sensitive and M the least sensitive of all Correspondingly Bs and As results are very different for the different variations Ws less and Ms still less different This correlation it is clear furnishes evidence in favor of eyemoveINTRMITTENC OF MINIMAL VISUAL SENSATIONS 8I ment as clearcut and decisive as that to be drawn from the changes in result produced by the different methods in the case of a single individual 8 Increase of practice in fixation brought with it a decrease in the frequency offluctuation and an increase in the duration of the afterimage Towards the close of the semesters work it became clear from the eyemovement records that there was an increased ability to fixate on the part of all the observers There was also a corresponding decrease in the frequency of fluctuation The pitch of the curve of frequency for the method of areas e g was lessened At both ends of the series areas that had fluctuated earlier would not now fluctuate at all and areas that formerly fluctuated readily now underwent fewer fluctuations The effect of practice was especially marked in the case of M There was also as the work advanced a de creased sensitivity to the methods used to disturb fixation With practice fixation became progressively more stable A general straightening of the frequency curves for all the meth ods employed was the result b General description of method and appfaratus All methods were ruled out as ineffective that did not produce changes in result markedly greater than the variations occurring from time to time without change of experimental conditions Ex periments were planned in series to be finished at a single sit ting Results obtained at different sittings were never com pared directly nor were the results from broken or interrupted series included in the general averages The order of presenta tion of the members of a series was changed from time to time in order to rule out time and practice errors Care was taken in the selection of Os to get a random sampling of types both as to visual organization and as to experience As little as possible was left to the uncontrolled introspection of the Os The analyses were provided for in the experimental variations and the Os were asked only for the simplest judgments and were kept in entire ignorance of the problem and plan of ex perimentation The recording apparatus used throughout consisted of kymo graph telegraphkey and electromagnetic recorder with electro magnetic timemarker regulated by a chronometer set to half seconds The experiments were conducted in a long optics room lighted at the one end by two windows reaching from near the floor to the ceiling The O head in rest was seated between these windows so that the light coming from either side and above fell upon the projectionfield of enginegray card board 75 cm in front The time of stimulation unless other wise stated was 40

Arizona during the year 19056 in the laboratory of the University of Colorado during the fall semester of 19067 in the Cornell University laboratory during the spring semester of I9067 and finished in the laboratory of Bryn Mawr College during the fall semester of 19078 The results have been verified both in drill courses and in re search with a wide range of observers of diverse training and experience The present section of the work was done for the most part in the laboratory of the University of Colorado A part of it has been repeated in the laboratory of Bryn Mawr College The following persons served as observers Professor J H Bair B the Misses Alden A Walter W Mont gomery M and Wright Wr students in his laboratory and Miss Stout S a student in the laboratory of Bryn Mawr College In the tables account is taken of the following points the number of fluctuations the first phase of visibility the average of the phases of visibility the sum of the phases of visibility the average of the phases of invisibility the sum of the phases of invisibility and the sum of the phases of visibility and in visibility One less than the number of phases of visibility has been taken as the number of fluctuations The last disappear ance has not been counted in estimating the number of fluctua tions This number is of value to us as a measure of the disturbance in the afterimage process A still better measure however is the frequency of fluctuation expressed by the average of the phases of visibility The length of the first phase of visibility is of importance as indicating at what inten sity the afterimage begins to fluctuate In general the stronger the operation of disturbing factors the greater should be the intensity at which the afterimage begins to fluctuate Accordingly then we should expect an increase of eye movement to decrease the first phase of visibility and a decrease of eyemovement to increase it The conventional use of the term duration has been departed from in this discussion By duration is here meant the sum of the phases of visibility This use of the term is in the first place strictly accurate so far as we have any immediate pres entation to consciousness of the afterimage process and so considered it has in the second place more direct bearing upon the problem of the restoration of the adapted stimulus No especial significance is attributed to the phases of invisi bility They are included in the tables merely that a complete account of the temporal course of the afterimage may be given I Fluctuation occurs only within a limited range of areasINTERMITTENCE OF MINIMAL VISUAL SINSATIONS 83 This statement holds of all the colors used Hering standard red green blue and yellow The result varied somewhat however for the different colors The red afterimage showed itself throughout to be the most instable It fluctuated most frequently had the shortest duration and was most affected by the various disturbances At the other extreme was the yellow afterimage It proved the most stable of all For this reason since space does not permit of giving results from all the stimuli the yellow image derived from Hering blue as stimulus has been selected for the following tables it affords the most rigid test of the effect of eyemovement on the tem poral course of the afterimage in general Areas ranging from5 by 5 cm to 61 by 50 cm the latter being the dimensions of a single sheet of Hering paper and viewed at a distance of 75 cm were employed A still larger area was required for some observers if no fluctuation was to ensue This increase in size was obtained by moving the stim ulus nearer to the observer It will be noticed from the tables that with small areas little or no fluctuation occurs Then there is increase up to a certain point namely 1020 cm square when decrease begins Fluctuation disappears entirely in the neighborhood of 6o65 cm square If we ask how far eyemovement is to be regarded as a causal factor in the increased fluctuation from small to medium areas and its consequent decrease we find the following evidence Over the range of areas showing increase of fluctuation the observers spoke of a strong conscious tendency to look away from the fixation point in order to see what was happening towards the margins This tendency constituted a distracting factor for fixation With small areas the whole afterimage lay within the field of direct observation consequently there was nothing to distract fixation With the next set of areas the edges passed into the field of indirect observation but were still noticeable Hence they disturbed fixation in various ways In the first place they broke the uniformity of the field of vision and in the second place the observer was instructed to register only total disappearances disappearances over the whole area The margins were not clearly visible and so tempted the eyes to a readjustment which would bring them into the field of clear vision and thus make observation easier With the third set of areas the margins had passed so far from the field of direct observation as to be of little concern to the observer The field was of an uniform color and bright ness and the margins did not compel attention The eyemovement records confirm these introspections There is increase of movement through the range of areas84 FERREE TABL

fixation was chosen as a measure of the eyemovements taking place This method had the disad vantage that the eyemovement could not be recorded while fluctuation was going on However by using only experi mental variations that produced marked changes in the steadi ness of fixation by alternating eyemovement with fluctuation records and by taking a large number of records for each experimental device this objection was practically obviated more especially as only comparative results were desired The method too has the very great advantage of sensitivity When e g the observer is stationed I meter from the stimu lus a shift of the afterimage i mm to either side represents an eyemovement measured by the chord of the arc of approximately o07 mm1 The sensitivity of this method is directly proportional to the distance of the observer from the stimulus and is limited only by the range of distinct vision Under favorable conditions exceedingly slight tremors can be detected In fact as a gauge for small eyemovements the method is far more sensitive than the methods of photography and of mechanical registration In the second method the afterimage was projected without a fixation point and a record was made of the time during which it was moved and of the time during which it was still This method was somewhat defective because the range of movement a very important factor in the causing of fluctua tion could be indicated only roughly by the introspective Calculation is made from the average of the first and second princi pal focal distances of the normal eye as estimated by Listing see Helmholtz Physiol Optik go86 FERREEC reports of the observers as to whether the afterimage moved rapidly or slowly However it proved a valuable supplement to the former method since by it the eyemovements were registered while the fluctuations were actually going on One could thus tell at once whether disappearance came as a direct effect of eyemovement i e whether it came while the eye was moving or immediately after it had moved or whether it came in an interval of rest The effect of vigorous quick movements could also be compared with that of weaker and slower movements Two forms of this second method were employed In the one the eyemovement and the phases of appearance and dis appearance of the afterimage were both recorded in the other the eyemovements alone were recorded The first form gave a direct tracing of the effect of eyemovement upon fluctuation The recording was done as follows The afterimage was pro jected without a fixation point and the key was held down as long as the afterimage was in motion and released when it came to rest When the afterimage disappeared the key was given two quick pressures and then released until the after image returned when the record of movement went on as before until the next disappearance A certain complication arose with this form of the method The effort to record both eyemovement and fluctuation seemed to interfere with the course of the afterimage so that fluctuation occurred more frequently than when fluctuations alone were recorded How ever the change was merely a general rise in the scale of fre quency The variations from device to device stood out just as plainly as when the alternative method was used The reason of the more frequent fluctuations is probably that the divided attention necessitated or rather that the rapidly alternating direction of attention resulted in a less steady fixation On this account the records that were meant to show simply the variation in eyemovement due to the various devices were taken according to the second method eyemovement alone was recorded Only these results will be given here since the others cannot be adequately stated in tabular formand space forbids the separate publication of every set The statement must suffice that causal connection between eyemovement and fluctuation is directly evident upon the inspection of the results in question For the investigation of the effect of variation of area upon eyemovement the second method second form was used The afterimages were projected without aid from fixation and the key was held down as long as they were in continuous motion and released during the intervals in which they were at rest The following results were obtainedINTERMITTENCE OF MINIMAL VISUAL SENSATIONS 87 TABLEU

was a square of standard Hering blue 3 by 3 cm fastened upon a large square of enginegray cardboard A square of the same cardboard was used as a background upon which to trace the course of the afterimage The effectiveness of the methods employed to disturb fixation was determined by records which showed the range and frequency of the eye movements produced and the total time during which the eyes were moving The methods themselves were five in number a The stimulus was fixated at its centre and the after image was projected without a fixationpoint b The stimulus was fixated at its

observed by help of a fixationpoint All the observers with one exception found the point of service for holding the afterimage steady The exception was Dr Bair for whom any effort at muscular control resulted in involuntary twitch ings In his case therefore the eyemovement records showed a greater unsteadiness of regard when effort was made to fixate the point than when the image was traced upon the blank surface of the cardboard c When the afterimage was projected without a fixationpoint it tended uniformly to move off in some particular direction varying with the observer Whatever be the explanation of this phenomenon it may possi bly be due to a faulty centering of the image upon the retina itself the result of some maladjustment of the visual mechanism movement resulting as a reflex tendency to more accurate fixation advantage may be taken of it to exaggerate or to correct eyemovement In order to exaggerate the movement the direction of the tendency was carefully determined at the beginning of the experimental series The stimulus was then fixated at a point placed in the line determined by this ten dency to movement but in the opbosite direction from the centre of the stimulus Part or all of the stimulus was thus thrown into indirect vision and the tendency of the after image to move was increasedseemingly in proportion of its displacement from the central portion of the field of vision The reflex movement which tends to centre the afterimage in the field of vision added to the natural tendency to movement and the afterimage projected without a fixation point moved off rapidly in the direction planned d To correct the tendency to movement the stimulus was fixated at a point placed in the line of the movement but in the same direction from the centre of the stimulus The consequent displaceINTERMITTENCE OF MINIMAL VISUAL SENSATIONS 89 ment of the afterimage set up a tendency to movement which counteracted the natural tendency By careful adjustment it was possible to obtain a fair balance of the two factors so that the afterimage was held steady when projected with out a fixation point Even under the rough conditions of our experiments this adjustment proved for some observers the best method of controlling fixation that we could de vise e For some observers the best aid to fixation was found to be a square drawn on the cardboard of exactly the same size and shape as the afterimage with a point placed at its centre When the eye moved the afterimage was ob served to slip from the square frame and the observer was thus able to correct the movement before it had attained any consid erable range With the combination of square and central point the observer had the double advantage of the aid to fix ation and the conscious check upon movement With the point alone there is little or no conscious control of move ment for the point has to move so far into the field of indirect observation that it is recognized as occupying a different posi tion before the control is operative and the eye can refixate The distraction to fixation presented by the sides of the square was probably little because the figure was small enough to be included practically as a whole in the field of direct observa tion At all events it did not offset the advantage in the cases of M A and Wr For A the afterimage projected without aid to fixation first moved off slowly to the left but soon turned sharply and moved much more quickly up and to the right the latter being the stronger component in the movement All fluctuations occurred during the second phase Hence the drift to the left was disregarded in the methods used for correction and exag geration To exaggerate the movement the fixation point was placed 9 mm below and 12 mm to the left of the centre of the stimulus To correct it was placed 9 mm above and 12 mm to the right of the centre For B the afterimage moved up and to the right To ex aggerate this movement the fixation point was placed 125 mm below the centre of the stimulus and 105 mm to the left To correct it was placed 85 mm above the centre and 85 mm to the right For W the afterimage tended to move up and to the right 1 The direction of the tendency to movement for the different ob servers will be stated in the discussion of the tables For the students passing through the junior laboratory course it seems most frequently upward or upward and to the right The dominant component appears to determine the observers type as to frequency and range of movement in the horizontal and vertical planes90 PFERRRE TABLU

fluctuation was considerably increased if the observer made no particular effort to hold the eyes steady The following results illustrate this point This method showed more plainly than any other the effect of a variation in the amount of eyemovement upon the fre quency of fluctuation For this reason the eyemovements resulting from the various devices employed were studied with some care Three cases were made of this determination specimen results will be given from each one   In order to compare the movements occurring first when a point is given for fixation and secondly when there is no such aid we had recourse to the shift of the afterimage from a col ored strip Strips of Herings standard yellow 5 by 50o mm were pasted on a background of white cardboard with the shorter dimension in the plane in which the eyemovement was to be investigated To determine frequency it was then neces sary simply to record the appearance of the afterimage to right or left above or below the stimulus Separate series were taken for each plane For the determination of range of movement narrow strips of paper of the same brightness as the background were pasted successively 2 4 6 8    mm from the stimulus and only those movements were re corded that shifted the image up to or beyond them While the strips were inconspicuous so that the eye was not drawn away from the fixation point it was not difficult to observe when the image reached or passed them The strips were also used when frequency alone was to be determined in order that the same experimental conditions might obtain throughout The record was made as follows When the objects of investi gation were the frequency of eyemovement and the total times during which the eyes maintained and lapsed from their proper fixation the observer pressed the key as the image ap peared to either side of the strip and held it down until the image was again superposed upon the stimulus Then the key was released and soon Since the eyes may be said to have been in motion for practically the whole period during which the im age was not superposed upon the stimulus the method gives a record of the total time for which the eyes were still and of the total time for which they were moving When again the range of movement was investigated the key was held down only while the image was out as far as or beyond the strips which served as range indicators These records therefore show only the times for which the point of regard was shifted a given distance from the fixation point and for which it was notINTERMITTENCE OF MINIMAL

within the field of direct observation they could thus exert no influence to increase eyemovement and we should expect a minimal disturbance of the afterimage The strips on the other hand were made 1The introspections as to rate of movement have not been incor porated in the other sets of eyemovement tables In general when the ratio time moving  time still is increased the rate of movement is also increased JOURNAL798 VERRRE TABLA XXI A1 Showing the effect upon eyemovement of the fixation devices used in Table XI Time Time Time Time Moving Rate of Variation Ob Mov StillMovement served ing

so that as their areas were equal to those of the squares their ends were thrown into the field of indirect ob servation and the tendency was towards increased eyemove ment Thus maximal disturbance of fixation was obtained for the given area and correspondingly a maximal disturbance of the afterimage was expected To illustrate a strip 5 x 5 cm had as its equivalent area a square of I5 cm a strip 5 x Io cm a square of 22 cm a strip 5 x 20 cm a square of 3 I cm and a strip 5 x 4o cm a square of 44 cm Only the squares of 22 3 I and 44 cm fluctuated at all while the strips showed a rapid increase in fluctuation until 5 by 40 cm was reached when a slight de crease occurred A strip 5 x 20 cm e g gave for A 8 fluctua tions with an average phase of visibility of 73 sec while its equivalent square gave no fluctuations at all av vis 715 sec No record was taken of fluctuation in parts only total disap pearances were registered Thus the actual disturbance suf fered by the stripimage was taken account of only in part It may be deduced from the following tables that the shape of the curve of frequency obtained by increasing the length of the strips is somewhat different from that obtained by increas ing the area of the squares Tables IIIV If a curve were plotted by laying off the lengths of the strips along the abscissa and the frequency of fluctuation along the ordinate the curve would start on or near the abscissa rise fairly steeply until a length of 2040 cm was reached and then bend downward slightly It would not reach the abscissa since with the lengths of strip used fluctuation did not cease as it did with increase of area when squares were used The reason of this difference between the results of the two sets of experiments will be given later in our discussion of the streaming phenomenonINTERMITTENCE OF MINIMAL VISUAL SENSATIONS 99 TABLE XXII A Form of stimulus afects frequency offluctuation of afterimage Results showing that fluctuation is more frequent when

 3 and 4 can be roughly duplicated by using voluntary eyemovement to cause the disappearances The voluntary eyemovement was regulated throughout in the following manner The afterimage was observed with the aid of a fixation point A second point was placed I2 cm to the right of this At a signal given every 3 sec by the ex perimenter the observer moved his eyes quickly out to this point and back again He was told to record as a disap pearance only a case in which the afterimage failed to reappear after the eyes had regained their normal fixation Thus noth ing but genuine disappearances were taken account of Possible visual synaesthesia attending eyemovement distraction etc were guarded against by the directions under which the observer worked The afterimages were blotted out as com pletely as afterimages ever are in the case of natural fluctua tion There is not a shadow of doubt on this point The more uniform side of enginegray cardboard was used as back ground for both stimulus and afterimage Hence there was no danger of disturbance by possible distractions due to move ment of the eye over an irregularly marked surface i Fluctuation occurs only within a limited range of areas Just as when the observation is made under the conditions of ordinary fixation the aftereffect of general adaptation does not fluctuate under the influence of voluntary eyemovement Nor do afterimages fluctuate beyond a comparatively limited range of areas Within this range the results are very similar to those obtained in the case of natural fluctuation Large images do not fluctuate at

General that in crease in the time of stimulation gave three results it increasedINTERMITTENCE OF MINIMAL VISUAL SENSATIONS III the intensity of the afterimage the amount of involuntary eyemovement and both the number of fluctuations and the intensity at which fluctuation began In order to determine positively which of the two first is the cause of the third it was necessary to study the effect of increase of intensity in isolation i e to increase intensity without increase of invol untary eyemovement Since increase in involuntary eye movement is found to follow increase in time of stimulation the increased intensity must be secured without increase of stimulation time This was done as follows Heringgray no 31 was used as stimulus background Squares 5 by 5 cm of Hering grays 15 and 7 and of Hering white were used in turn as stimuli The intensity of the stimulus in this case is measured by its difference from the background Thus the intensities roughly at least stood in the relation 16 24 31 A square of Hering gray no 15 was used as the background upon which to project the afterimages This shade of gray was selected because it corresponded approximately to the aftereffect of the stimulus background Thus the projection background was kept constant until the afterimage whose fluctuations were being observed finally disappeared This precaution may not have been necessary but it seemed well to plan the experiment as carefully as possible The time of stimulation was 40 sec throughout All these conditions were the same for the different stimuli A typical set of averages has been selected for publication It will be observed that increase of intensity without increase in time of stimulation does not increase either the number of fluctuations or the intensity at which fluctuation begins Hence these results when obtained with increase in time of stimulation must be due to increase of eyemovement TABLE XLVII A Results showing that increase in

of variability in fluctuation and duration This will be seen by a comparison of the eye movement with the afterimage tables for each of the observers and for the various methods used Dr Bair B and Miss Alden A were the most sensitive the Misses Montgomery M and Wright Wr the least and Miss Walter W was of intermediate sensitivity 8 Increase ofpractice in fixation brought with it a decrease in the frequency of fluctuation and an increase in the duration of the afterimage Space does not permit us to show in detail this falling off in sensitivity of the different observers as the work progressed It will be sufficient to say that it was quite marked iii How does eyemovement cause the fluctuation and shorten the duration of the afterimage  a It is evident that neither Fechners nor Helmholtz theory is adequate to the results given in the preceding Sec tions Changes in illumination Helmholtz do not account for the shape of the curve of frequency for variation of area Nor do they explain the fluctuation of the afterimage in parts or the effect produced upon fluctuation by variations in the form and arrangement of the stimulus Fechners theory that eyemovement arouses vascular and nervous disturbances which in turn react upon the afterimage is first of all too indefinite We are not told how these disturbances work and no tangible evidence is adduced that eyemovement produces them In the second place even if the disturbances are granted it is difficult to understand why they take place in this and that part of the retina while the remainder is not affected fluctuation in parts why they are effective in the case of certain areas and not at all in that of others effect of variation of area on fluctuation and still more why the form of the stimulus and its arrangement with regard to the direction of greatest range and frequency of eyemovement etc affect the fluctuation and duration of the afterimage as powerfully as they are found to do Fick and Giirber follow a different course They study the relief of adaptation not like Helmholtz and Fechner from the side of the negative afterimage but from the positive side They show in various ways that the color or brightness of a stimulus to which the eye has been adapted is restored by eye movement They contend that adaptation is a phenomenon of fatigue and that eyemovement relieves it chiefly by facili tating the removal of the fatigue products from the retina less importantly by increasing the delivery of new material to theINTERMITTENCE OF MINIMAL VISUAL SENSATIONS 113 fatigued endorgans This hypothesis though perhaps the most promising of all the eyemovement theories is at the same time scarcely less speculative than the others The passage of lymph to and from the retinal elements is a necessary postulate of metabolism but Fick and Giirber give no direct or positive proof that eyemovement facilitates the exchange nor has the proof been brought by any subsequent investigator Vascular disturbances in the retina are alleged as indirect evidence The following authorities may be cited upon this point On the nega tive side we find A Coccius TJeber die Anwendung des Augenspiegels etc 1853 20 who was the first to investigate the matter asserting that the disturbances are not present in the case of quick short eye movements 0 Becker Archiv f Ophthalmol XVIII I 1872 242 contends that eyemovement exerts no especial influence since he finds fluctuations in the caliber of the retinal vessels when the eye muscles are paralyzed by atropine On the positive side A v Graefe Archiv f Opthalmol I 2 1855 387 establishes the general principle that eyemovement causes an increase of pressure in the vitreous humor hence every change of fixation is followed by an increase of vascular pulsation in the retina Michell Lehrbuch der Augenheil kunde I Aufl 547 observed that eyemovement causes a paling of the retinal capillaries W Dobrowolsky Centralblatt f d medic Wissensch 1870 20o and 21 working on a dog observed frequent changes in the calibre of the retinal capillaries These changes dis appeared however when motor paralysis was produced by curare the capillaries also became paler when the eyemuscles were electri cally stimulated Fick and Giirber themselves working both on the human eye and on the eyes of dogs were able in some cases to observe the effect of eyemovement on the calibre of the retinal vessels They found e g in the case of the human eye that when the eyes are held steadily upon some distant object vascular changes are not noticeable but that noticeable changes occur when the eyes are moved They believe that these changes are not normal pulsations due to the hearts action but are directly caused by the eyemovements The natural pulse they say is not observable for various reasons thus it may possibly be obscured by the rapidity of the hearts action This sup position seems to receive confirmation from the results of experiments on dogs When the dogs were put under the influence of chloral or morphine and all the eyemuscles severed a rhythmical change in the calibre of the retinal vessels was plainly noticeable Since eye movement could not operate to produce this rhythm they regard it as that of the natural retinal pulse now rendered observable through the slowing of the hearts action by the drugs used On the whole however and having regard both to their own work and to that of others Fick and Giirber did not consider the evidence that eye movement influences retinal circulation to be entirely satisfactory Moreover if we look at the problem from the side of the negative afterimage the hypothesis can apparently be of ser vice only in explaining the effect of eyemovement upon the total duration of the afterimage Facilitation of the removal of fatigue products does not account for fluctuation for if the fatigue material is carried away so completely as to cause the disappearance of the afterimage there is no satisfactory or plausible reason why it should accumulate again and cause the JOURNL8114 FERRE afterimage to reappear when the eye has in the meantime un dergone no additional stimulation Since then the hypothe sis cannot explain a simple case of fluctuation it manifestly cannot account for the variations in the phenomenon discussed in the foregoing pages and failing in this regard it mani festly has not taken into consideration all the factors that operate to relieve adaptation b Much to our surprise the solution of the problem came with the observation of a phenomenon which for want of a better term will be called the streaming phenomenon We turn to its consideration with the reluctance that a writer must feel in pointing out a new phenomenon in a field so old and so minutely canvassed as that of vision but nevertheless with a full sense of responsibility The phenomenon was first ob served in 19o5 and since that time has been carefully investi gated by the writer with the aid of nine observers seven stu dents of psychology and two laymen All were sceptical at the outset but later independently of one anothers and of the writers observations were able to describe the phenomenon in detail and to sketch the more prominent of the multitude of stream patterns I A brief description is difficult When one sits with lightly closed lids which must be kept from quivering before a bright diffuse light such as that of a partly clouded sky I Fick and Gtirber do not treat their problem from the side of the negative afterimage nor are they primarily concerned with this as pect of adaptation especially with the fluctuation of the negative afterimage at the same time they offer an explanation of this fluctuation The explanation however does not account for the vari ous cases and types of fluctuation and its basis is both hypothetical and in terms of the results of our own observers contrary to fact It runs as follows Augenbewegungen und Accommodation quetschen die Netzhaut gleichsam aus das negative Nachbild verschwindet Aber nicht aus der ganzen Netzhaut werden die Stoffwechselproducte entfernt sondern nur aus der empfindlichsten Schichte darum taucht das negative Nachbild in demselben Masse wieder auf in dem sich die Stoffwechselproducte wieder iiber die empfindlichste Netzhautschi chte verbreiten Archiv f Ophthalmol XXXVI 300 Observation shows rather that instead of the waste material being forced from the afterimage area by eyemovement and returning to it when the intra ocular pressure is relieved just the reverse movement of material takes place That is eyemovement causes a wash of material from some part of the surrounding retina over the afterimage area As long as this streaming material is passing over the area the after image cannot be seen When it has passed beyond it the image re appears 2 It is not clear e g why the waste material forced from the after image area does not return to cause the reappearance of large and small afterimages as it does so readily in the case of afterimages of medium area Similar difficulties too obvious to need separate men tion are encountered in the other cases discussed aboveINTERMITTENCE

steadied slowly moving swirls These swirls have the appearance of streams of granules moving in broad curves now this way now that seemingly without order unless a noticeable eyemovement occurs or is

Such painstaking precautions are necessary however only until the ob server has once seen the phenomenon Afterwards there is no diffi culty In fact like the entoptic and circulation phenomena the streaming may even become troublesome by its insistence The plane of fixation is a matter of peculiar consequence One must look through and beyond the shifting changing indefinite haze that occu pies the visual foreground of the closed eyes No better direction can be given than that the observer try to resolve this haze to find out what lies in and behind it He must gaze intently and pene tratingly Since the smoothest part of the closed lid lies above the centre of the eye it is of advantage to look slightly upward instead of directly forward The steady field of vision should reveal the streaming but voluntary eyemovement by increasing its activity frequently facilitates the observation If one moves the eye sharply and intently watches the field of vision in the trail of the movement one sees sometimes immediately following and sometimes lagging behind a stream which takes the general direction of the movement By way of final caution we cannot emphasize too thoroughly the need of persistence and patience in observing An unpractised ob server should not expect to see the phenomenon in less than 25 min utes after closing his eyes The field of vision must clear and settle and the observer must grow accustomed to the unusual conditions of observation 2 The real movement of the streaming is in the opposite direction to that of the retina The apparent motion of the eye is the movement of its anterior portion This is opposite to the movement of the retina hence the streaming material seems to pass across the field of vision in the direction in which the eye is moving It might of course be expected that a mobile material on the retina would move under the influence of eyemovement as the streaming material is thus found to do116 FERREE rents moving at varying rates of speed Now and again a heavy stream will sweep across this channeled surface from one direction or another taking up the minor swirls as sharply curving tributaries and so on through manifold changes Various patterns can be picked out and a particular swirl may be traced in its deviations for a time but as a whole the phenomenon cannot be adequately described After practice on the closed lids the observers became able to trace the streaming on any dull or rough surface with the eyes open It may also be observed under the conditions of observation of the entoptic and circulation phenomena but just as one must look beyond the false scotomata to see the moving corpuscles and interspaces so must one look beyond them to see the streaming So competent did certain observers become with the eyes open that records were made in the experiments with minimal stimuli of the time that heavy streaming lasted during the phases of invisibility 2 In casting about for a physiological explanation of the streaming phenomenon we have been led to believe that it is caused by a streaming over the retina of some material which is capable of directly affecting the processes that condition visual sensation First on the negative side we find that it cannot be a circulation entoptic or tearfilm phenomenon or any of the shadow phenomena for it is seen in the dark as well as in the light In fact the best way to observe it with the eyes open is in the dark room or in a carefully muffled black ness cylinder Secondly on the positive side we have three facts to consider The streaming occurs as we have just men tioned in the dark as well as in the light It is seen in the dark as a streaming and swirling of the intermingled blackness and luminous haze that compose the visual field Here it must directly excite the blackwhite process Again the streams carry with them the quality of the background from which they proceed This fact may be demonstrated as follows Get upon the retina a large square blue afterimage having through its centre a vertical strip of yellow Projected upon the field of vision afforded by the closed lids in daylight this image will be seen as a strip of reddish yellow on a back ground of purple A heavy stream in passing across the strip will sweep the purple with it across the yellow and will de posit traces of the yellow in irregular patches on the further side In other cases where a heavy swirling takes place over the strip area the yellow will break up irregularly traces and The phenomenon comes out with remarkable clearness with open eyes in the blackness of the dark room The field of slightly lumin ous haze that there confronts one for some minutes at a certain dis tance streams and swirls with convincing distinctnessINTERMITTENCE OF MINIMAL VISUAL SENSATIONS 117 patches of its color being borne out in different directions and the background swept in In yet other cases the swirl will form outside the image and sweep across it much as a swirl of snow is carried before the wind In all of these variations of streamtype however it is the unfailing rule that the qual ity of the background is carried by the stream from point to point in its course Lastly the streaming has a characteristic effect upon the afterimage Gentle streaming dims the after image apparently in proportion to its vigor provided that it comes from an area of different visual quality but heavy streaming blots it out absolutely This occurrence once seen can never be doubted The observation is positive 3 The effect of streaming is the same whether the eyes are open or closed It is true that the stream is not so clearly seen to sweep over the afterimage when this is projected on a back ground with the eyes open as when it is projected on the field of the closed lids Nevertheless the instant that the image disappears streaming can always be plainly seen over the area which it occupied If the background is a rough dull surface the stream can even be seen to form and pass across the image Most of our observers readily noticed this phenomenon and some reported it before they had discovered streaming in the field of the closed lids so that it formed their first observation of streaming1 We have further indirect evidence of the identity of fluc tuation under the two conditions of projection in the striking 1 A word of explanation here may prevent misunderstanding What was observed with the eyes open was that the background seemed to sweep over this or that part of the afterimage area and that as the stream advanced the color disappeared The stream seemed decid edly to sweep the color out or at least to be causally connected with its disappearance The phenomenon is naturally less striking than it is when the afterimage is seen on the field of the closed lids For one thing the image is now projected on a field some distance away the streams are thus magnified and accordingly rendered vague and diffuse less distinct in form and outline For another thing the brightness of daylight illumination tends to obscure the phenomenon And other factors in the result could probably be mentioned Many of the brief disappearances of visual stimuli especially those of positive stimuli of considerable intensity are seen to be caused in the same way by streaming The stream sweeps over them and blots them out as it passes off they reappear from behind slightly farther back The latter phenomenon is especially noticeable in the case of the shadows cast by a false scotoma on the retina Similar observations may be made in the course of adaptation ex periments Lay e g a fairly dark disc of Hering gray on a back ground of Hering gray several shades darker While the disc is leveling down to the background this or that portion of it will be repeatedly swept out by streams moving across it in a curve Many of the writers laboratory students at different colleges have reported this phenomenonIIS 8FRREE correspondence which obtains between the types of disappear ance when the image is observed as is ordinarily done on a cardboard or other background and when it is traced on the field of the closed lids in conjunction with streaming Parallel series of experiments were carried out with afterimages in the form of strips squares and crosses large and small projected both upon a background of cardboard and upon the field of the closed lids The result was that if a sufficient number of cases is considered every type of disappearance found in the one series can be found also in the other The following paired observations

spread in the direction in which the disappearance of the strip was taking place The phenomenon was very clear e g when a corner bottom or what not went out and the disappearance spread finally involving the whole image This type of disappearance when observed on the closed lids generally showed a swirling stream which spread centrifu gally until the whole afterimage area was swept over 4 The effect of streaming on the flight of colors is three fold First a gentle streaming may merely dim the color Secondly more intensive streaming advances the color changes one or more stages When the change is advanced only one stage the image sometimes does and sometimes does not re turn to the preceding stage when the stream has passed over When the change is advanced two or more stages the image apparently always returns to the initial stage or to the initial stage but one when the stream has cleared away Thirdly when the streams are strong and heavy the image is blotted out completely returning to the initial stage when the stream has passed on either abruptly or quickly through the series of color changesmost frequently in their inverse order but sometimes in irregular order These effects cannot be due to a shadow cast by the stream upon the retina for shadows like any reduction of the illumination of the retina push the color change in the inverse direction Hence we have here addi tional evidence that the locus of the physiological condition of streaming is not anterior to the retina The following is a description of the effect of streaming on the flight of colors An account of the phenomenon as it 1 All the phenomena described in connection with streaming areINTERMITTENCE OF MINIMAL VISUAL SENSATIONS 121 appears under still better conditions has been given above afterimage from the suns disc The stimulus was afforded by a triangular opening i by 2 ft in a curtain near the ceiling of a closely curtained room 0 was seated about io ft from this opening and looked up through it directly at the brightly illuminated sky The sash of the window was lowered In line with the centre of the opening was a patch of bright fleecy clouds Thus the stimu lus consisted of a brilliant blue triangle with a bright white patch at its centre When stared at for a long time e g for 5 min the triangle underwent the following qualitative changes The white patch at its centre became gradually dim mer Finally it became completely overcast with the sur rounding blue This was concomitant with intensive streaming of the swirling type It cleared somewhat then the whole triangle changed to a deep saturated pink After remaining in this stage for a short time it changed again to blue and finally once more to pink Here the observation ceased When the afterimage was to be traced 0 fixated the centre of the opening for about 20 sec and then covered the closed eyes with a black cloth The observation was thus made in a welldarkened field of vision The report is as follows Afterimage developed as light faintly reddish blue Fluctuated several times between this and yellowish green Thus far as it hap pened the streaming was not intensive Finally settled into yellow ish green Heavy streams frequently swept across carrying it com pletely out On reappearing it came directly back to yellowish green once The remaining times it reappeared first as deep red then quickly changed into yellowish green The yellowish green area grew smaller as fluctuation went on leaving a growing border of deep red Next fluctuation began from yellowish green to deep red as a result of less intensive streaming The yellowish green area was swept off as if it were an upper layer leaving the purplish red under neath and further back One could see the yellowish green streaming raggedly beyond the afterimage This was very plain at times Once a narrow stream was observed to cut a channel through the yellowish green near the toe of triangle exposing the deep red appar ently beneath Disappearances also took place at this stage as result of heavy streaming Afterimage finally settled down into deep red This layer seemed to be noticeably farther back in the field of vision than the other color layers Disappearances were quite frequent and were plainly the result of streaming This stage lasted relatively a long time Next faint stages respectively of dark blue and dull dark yellow were noticeable Fluctuations were frequent and disappear ances long There was the usual connection between fluctuation and streaming noticeably plainer when the observation is made in the higher alti tudes Whether this result is due solely to the condition of illumina tion there found which facilitates observation especially when made in daylight on the field of the closed lids and conceivably induces a more or less special retinal state or whether indirect physiological influences are at work the writer has no means of deciding122 FERREE The following is a variation of the streaming phenomenon not observed in connection with afterimages It is given as possibly throwing some light on the physiological condition of streaming from a slightly different angle The observation was made out of doors in Colorado early in October near the middle of a cloudless day The light stimulation was very intensive Sometimes when the eyes having been exposed to the bright diffuse light were closed and the field of vision had settled one saw scat tered over it here and there and fairly close together islands or patches slightly darker than the background presenting a porous appearance due to a peculiar mottling of lighter and darker gray These patches were not afterimages They were however readily seen to be carried along and broken up by the streams the parts taking the velocity of the stream current Streams could be seen to cut channels through groups of the patches The patches themselves seem to be conditioned by some mobile material which shares in the general streaming Another phenomenon which seems to indicate that there is even a mass mobility of the material which conditions visual sensation is described as follows The observation was made under the same conditions as the last When one has two or more afterimages of the suns disc close to gether they will often be seen soon to merge into one Sometimes a channel cuts across from the one to the other and the two gradually draw together into a more or less circular form Again the one will be seen to move bodily towards the other finally uniting with it 5 That there is a dependence of streaming upon eyemove ment cannot be doubted This dependence is shown in two ways First when an eyemovement is noticeable or is made voluntarily a heavier stream is started in the apparent tangle of swirling in the direction of the eyemovement Secondly whenever involuntary eyemovement is increased as by previous long fixation by a faulty centering of the afterimage upon the retina etc greater commotion is noticeable over the streaming area That there is a movement of this material independent of the effect of eyemovement is also probable but the heavy streams that intermittently blot out the afterimage are doubt less determined by eyemovement1 What the nature of the streaming material is we shall not attempt to decide further than to point out that the results show it to be visu ally active Metabolism requires that there be a diffusion of lymph over the retina We might then identify the streaming material with this metabolic substance making it the vehicle of both catabolic and anabolic processes The anabolic material is conceivably in part dis integrated visual substance which retains for a time its power to con dition visual sensation as is shown by the streams bearing with them the visual quality of the region from which they come Thus by weakening the afterimage through hastening metabolic change and by setting up strongly the sensation of the region from which theINTERMITTENCE OF MINIMAL VISUAL SENSATIONS 123 c When once we have established the connection between fluctuation and eyemovement on the one hand and eyemove ment and streaming on the other explanation goes compara tively smoothly The results obtained by varying the steadi ness of fixation and by increasing the time of stimulation present no especial problem There is in these cases merely an increase or decrease of eyemovement and a corresponding increase or decrease in the streaming activity with a resultant increase or decrease in fluctuation With the remaining meth ods however the situation is different They will be consid ered in turn I We have found that fluctuation occurs only within a limited region of afterimage areas Probably the most difficult problem that fluctuation sets to theory is this effect of variation of area Before it the oscillatory theory seems to break down absolutely Considered with regard to area afterimages naturally fall into four classes small images which fluctuate little or not at all for our observers images with an area of 15 by 15 cm and less larger images which fluctuate over their whole area still larger images which fluctuate in parts and quite large images which do not fluctuate at all Now this grouping is just what we might expect from the nature of the streaming phenomenon It derives directly from the following facts that streaming does not cause disappearance unless the stream comes from a part of the retina undergoing different stimulation that the streams have a more or less definite form i e that they sweep across this or that part of the afterimage preserving pretty clearly defined borders that vigorous streaming appar ently occurs only over a somewhat limited region about the point of regard and that the centre of the field of vision is always in a state of more or less violent swirling Here the streams are narrow and swiftmoving 1 as we pass towards streams come heavy streaming may temporarily obscure the after image It is however useless to work out in detail what with our present knowledge of visual processes can at best be but a mere con jecture We desire to lay stress upon nothing except the observed facts 1The direction of streaming is as we have seen determined or mod ified by eyemovement The lines of direction described by all the points on the moving retina for the various directions in which the eye moves crowd together in its central portion hence all the streams since their directions are determined by the moving retina converge towards its centre This accounts for the narrowing of the streams and the consequent more rapid motion of the streaming ma terial More or less continuous commotion at the centre must also result from these conditions and the twisted swirling tangled pat terns are produced by the manytimes compounded motions The centre of the retina is thus least liable to adaptation and afterimage124 FERREE the periphery the swirling becomes more diffuse and the streams are broader and more widely separated both in space and time For convenience of discussion therefore the retinal field may be divided into four zones each one of which usually but not always contains different stages of the same stream The streams form near the periphery of the retina and tend to move towards its centre In the first or central zone streaming is practically continuous Here the streams are narrow swift and often crowded together The second zone is made up in part of crosssections of the streams found in the first and in part of streams whose directions have been changed before they reached the first zone Here the streams are broader and less swift and vigorous The streaming at any given point is dis continuous a given segment of the zone is streamed over at irregular intervals In the third zone are found in general the source and the upper courses of the streams passing across the first and second zones The streaming here is still more discontinuous and the streams are still broader and more sluggish The fourth zone lies beyond the area of observable streaming The infrequency or entire absence of fluctuation of the small images of the first group is explained by the fact that they lie wholly within the first zone the region of most active commo tion Hence when they have once reached the dimness at which disappearance begins there is not sufficient lull in the streaming for reappearance to occur The records show less eyemovement for the images of the first than for those of the second group Here we come upon an exception to the general law of the effect of eyemovement upon fluctuation for this re duction of eyemovement favors rather than decreases the fluctuation of these small images It is however readily in telligible that a more continuous eyemovement by causing more continuous streaming would give even less opportunity for reappearance The images of the second group extend beyond the limits of the central zone and the continuous streaming of this region does not cause them to disappear since to do so the streams must come from a region of different stimulation They lie however within the second zone where the streaming is still vigorous though not continuous A broad heavy stream sweeps in from the outside and may either blot out the whole image at once this depends upon the relative sizes of stream effects This conclusion tallies with wellknown facts of vision The centre of the retina is the region of clearest vision adaptation there takes place less quicklyand the correlated afterimages develop more slowlyINTERMITTENCE OF MINIMAL VISUAL SENSATIONS 125 and image or may at first efface only a part Then as the stream compounds with other streams the whole image will become involved When the commotion subsides the image reappears remaining until blotted out by another stream or streamsystem Since we are now in a region of only occasional streaming increase of eyemovement must increase the frequency of fluctuation by increasing the number of streams that sweep across the image There is however sufficient intermission in the streaming for reappearance to take place Continuous voluntary eyemovement would probably produce continuous streaming over this region but under the conditions of ordi nary fixation we have a fluctuation which is proportional to the frequency and range of eyemovement The images of the third group are still included in the region of streaming They lie within the borders of the third zone but are too large to have their whole area involved at one time by a single stream or streamsystem So we have the phe nomenon of fluctuation in parts As in the previous case in crease of eyemovement increases streaming and accordingly increases frequency of fluctuation The images of the fourth group cover the whole area of effective streaming Their borders lie in the fourth zone and consequently fluctuation does not occur The streams that twist about over the surfaces of these images do not come from a region of different stimulation consequently do not blot them out1 2 We found that the form of the stimulus affects the fre quency of fluctuation and the duration of the afterimage The stimuli used were strips and squares of equivalent areas We now have to explain first the shape of the curve of fre quency for the stripimages An increased length of strip while it produces practically the same effect on eyemovement as increased area of square does not give the same shape to the curve With the squares the curve after reaching its maximal height bends down rather sharply to the abscissEe 1 The explanation in this and the following sections may seem somewhat complicated but the facts are themselves complicated The results of observation are recorded as they were obtained in no wise modified to suit the needs of theory The phenomena of stream ing and the phenomena of fluctuation were investigated independently and at different times The details of streaming its patterns zones etc were worked out and in part verified a full year before the re sults on fluctuation given in the foregoing tables were obtained After those results had been obtained however for variations in size form arrangement etc of stimulus the present investigations were begun with projection of the images on the field of the closed lids in order to determine the relation of the various types of fluctuation to the various types of streaming Thus our theory is in reality a de scription of what actually takes place in observation126 FERREE with the strips it dips down very little The explanation is that the squares as they grow larger come to include the whole of the noticeable streaming area while the strips do not The strips can accordingly always be swept across by streams coming from a region of different stimulation They can be blotted out while the squares cannot The shape of the curve for the strips is very like that for the squares until the maximal height is reached up to this point streaming affects both strips and squares alike We have to explain secondly the fluctuation of strips and the partial absence of fluctuation of squares of equivalent area The explanation lies in the difference of the retinal zones The squares fall within the first and the innermost part of the second zone The strips in proportion as they are in cluded within the first second and third zones show the phe nomena of fluctuation characteristic of these regions 3 We found that the arrangement of the stimulus with reference to the direction of greatest eyemovement affects the frequency of fluctuation and the duration of the afterimage Narrow strips of varying length undergo more frequent fluc tuations and have a shorter duration when the direction of greatest range and frequency of eyemovement is across 1he strip than when the inverse arrangement obtains The reason is clear the streams must be more effective to produce disap pearance when they sweep across the narrow afterimage than when they traverse its length Suppose e g that a narrow strip is placed with its length first in the vertical and then in the horizontal plane Let the eyemovement in both cases take place in the horizontal plane The vertical strip can be more effectively swept by streams coming from a region of different stimulation than can the horizontal strip Accord ingly we find greater frequency of fluctuation and a shorter duration of the image in the former case than in the latter Conversely when the movement is in the vertical plane and the strip is arranged first vertically and then horizontally the opposite effect should be produced The tables show that this is the case In the experiments on natural fluctuations the greater range and frequency of eyemovement for all observers were in the horizontal plane Hence greater frequency of fluctuation and shorter duration should have been observed when the strip was arranged with its length in the vertical plane The tables show that this expectation was realized 1 The character of the disappearance is somewhat different accord ing as it is due to voluntary eyemovement or to natural fluctuation In the former event it is more abrupt and more nearly covers the whole length of the image In natural fluctuation the image usuallyINTERMITTENCE OF MINIMAL VISUAL SENSATIONS 127 4 Having thus ascertained the part played by streaming in the determination of the duration and fluctuation of the afterimage we can understand how it is that results ob tained when the fluctuations were produced by involuntary eyemovement varying in amount from method to method could be duplicated by results obtained when the fluctuations were produced by voluntary eyemovement constant from method to method There are two possible reasons First there was present in both cases a variable amount of involun tary eyemovement and secondly there was in both cases the same distribution of the zones of streaming There can be no doubt that voluntary eyemovement while it lessened did not entirely prevent involuntary movement In the variation of this latter from method to method we might find a basis for the variation in results obtained and therefore an explanation of the duplication On the other hand there is strong evidence that the concomitant involun tary eyemovement was not the direct cause of fluctuation The disappearances always followed directly upon the volun tary movements which must therefore be regarded as the immediate cause of fluctuation The involuntary movefnents could have functioned only indirectly by way of weakening the afterimage under certain experimental conditions and thus rendering it more liable to obliteration by the voluntary movements Obviously then the distribution of the zones of streaming is the more important factor It is not difficult to see how these two factors cooperated to produce our results If there were no variation of involuntary eyemovement from method to method strict duplication should result when the fluctuations are produced by voluntary eye movement If it were not for the identical distribution of the zones of streaming duplication could not result at all A con sideration of the two factors together enables us to explain the results obtained 5 The peculiarities of fluctuation in indirect vision are readily explained as a result of the distribution of the zones of goes out in successive parts quickly until it has disappeared The difference reflects the nature of the eyemovement The voluntary movement is a single sweep out and back of considerable strength and range A broad current of the streaming material is thus carried across the image in the direction of the eyemovement and blots it out at once The involuntary movements occurring in the case of natural fluctuation are irregular in direction range and frequency and usually come in groups They therefore start a number of streams in different directions and usually in quick succession One stream is often seen to sweep across this part another across that until finally the whole image becomes involved before any part has had time to clear128 FERREE streaming When a small afterimage is observed first in the central part of the field and then successively farther and far ther out from the centre there is first an increase in fluctua tion then a decrease and finally an entire cessation Now we have seen that an image in the central zone of streaming once it has disappeared is kept from reappearing by the continuous commotion there present As it passes from the central zone outward into the region of occasional streaming fluctuation must increase up to a certain point probably the limits of the second zone and thereafter decrease ceasing entirely when the image passes beyond the range of noticeable streaming 6 Fechner1 Helmholtz and others maintain that blinking and movement of the head as well as movement of the eyes cause the afterimage to disappear Both of these movements however result in eyemovement and hence may be supposed to be only indirectly causes of disappearance With regard to blinking 0 Weiss says3 Beim Lidschluss zeigt sich eine Bewegung des Bulbus erst nach oben innen dann nach oben aussen This is called Bells phenomenon The movement can easily be felt when one presses the finger with moderate firmness on the lids above and to the temporal side of each bulb and blinks vigorously Von Michel thinks that this movementcomplex is controlled by the cortex while Nagel6 believes it to be a reflex due to the pressure of the edges of the lids upon the cornea However this may be there is distinct eyemovement in at least two directions with every closing and opening of the lids that is to say there is ample ground for considering eyemovement to be the more imme diate cause of the disappearance of the afterimage Again even if the eye were stationary in its socket move ment of the head would affect the streaming phenomenon very much as movement of the eyes does The streaming material would traverse the retina in the opposite direction to that of the movement But the eye is not thus stationary movement of the head results either in a movement of the eye in the oppo site direction or in this together with a readjustment of the eye in accordance with the changed position of the head And there is further a rotation of the eye about its horizontal axis which according to Donders opposes the rotation of the head 1 Ann d Phys u Chem L 184o 221 2Phys Optik 510 8 Nagels

direction as the movement of the field of vision the converse of what happens with eyemovement The effect on the afterimage however would be essentially the sameINTERMITTENCE OF MINIMAL VISUAL SENSATIONS 129 and is of equal amount in both eyes In the case of a sudden inclination of the head Mulder found a momentary torsion of 20o His conclusions as regards permanent torsion bear out those of Skrebitzky2 Nagel found that movements of torsion occur if the head or the head and body together are passively moved In fine then the effect upon the afterimage of blinking and of movements of the head presents no especial problem to theory in both cases definite and measureable eyemovements take place Eyemovement as determining or modifying the streaming phenomenon explains fluctuation under these con ditions as readily as it explains the fluctuations which occur under the conditions of normal fixation III CONCLUSIONS AND RESTATEMENT OF THESIS The conclusions to be drawn from the foregoing experiments with regard to the fluctuation and duration of the negative afterimage are as follows I The fluctuation of the nega tive afterimage represents a real intermission of sensation It is not an artifact due to observation under the conditions of light adaptation for it occurs as readily in a darkened as in a light field of vision 2 Fluctuation is not grounded in the nature of the afterimage process It is caused chiefly by in voluntary eyemovement 3 Eyemovement causes the fluc tuation and decreases the duration of the negative afterimage by conditioning or modifying the streaming over the retina of some material capable of affecting the visual processes Enlarged and restated in the light of these conclusions our thesis is this i The intermittence of minimal visual sensa tion is a phenomenon of adaptation 2 Adaptation is ren dered intermittent chiefly through the influence of eyemove ment 3 Eyemovement interferes with adaptation in three ways a It decreases the total time of stimulation The more eyemovement there is the less intensive will be the im pression made upon the retina b It affords time for the afterimage to die away or in terms of adaptation it gives opportunity for restoration proportional to the length of time during which the stimulated area is relieved And c more immediately it determines or influences the washing or stream ing over the retina of some material capable of directly affect ing the visual processes Further evidence for this thesis will be adduced in later papers 1Archiv f Opthalmol XXI I 1875 68 2 Archiv f Opthalmol XVII

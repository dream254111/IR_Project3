PlatesIVVIII BY THOS H MONTGOMERY JR PHD ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF ZOOLOGY UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA PHILADELPHIA Read January 18 1901 I INTRODUCTION The present study is practically a continuation of previous work of mine upon sper matogenesis in the Arthropods It was undertaken primarily to correct certain errors of interpretation and observation in my work on Pentatoma Euchistus But many mor phological problems arose in connection with this reexamination such as the significance of the changes in the synapsis stage the significance of the chromatin nucleoli the reasons for a reduction division the significance of the sequence of the stages of the germinal cycle and the question as to why different species have different numbers of chromosomes Thus my investigations given here are essentially on the history of the chromosomes during the germinal cycle It is impossible to answer these problems by an examination of a single species and accordingly there are presented here the results of a comparative study of the spermato genesis of some fortytwo species of Hemriptera heteroptera belonging to twelve different families This comparative study has brought to light certain wholly unexpected phe nomena and none less anticipated than the discovery of four species with an uneven normal number of chromosomes this discovery has furnished facts for explaining how the chromosomal numbers may change with the evolution of the species and how the chromatin nucleoli may have originated And only such a comparative study could furnish facts to show that in the synapsis stage bivalent chromosomes are formed by the union of paternal with maternal chromosomesi e that this is the stage of conjugation of the chromosomes The comparative method in Cytology cannot be overestimated hough of course careful detailed examinations of single objects should be carried on at the same time For a single object is rarely capable of serving as the basis of explanaA STUDY OP THE CHROMOSOMES OF THE GERM CELLS OF METAZOA tion ioof all the roblems an inestigation of a number of forms always shows that some are more favorable than others for answering certain questions and then there is the chance that a wholly unexpected discovery may be made that may have great signifi cance So the plea is made here for the comparative method in Cytology and Cytology should not be ranked as a line of work separate from othersit is all Morphology in the broad sense of the term and it only happens that in Cytology we use higher magnifica tion powers of the microscope than in other lines If one form shows phenomena that seem inexplicable after careful work then the proper method the one that would promise a surer reaching of results is not to reexamine this form again and again but to compare other forms in the search for the explanation In the present paper the part containing the general conclusions may appear dispro portionally great to the record of the observations These observations are to great extent on the number and valence of the chromosomes and chromatin nucleoli from the time of the last generation of the spermatogonia up to the formation of the spermatids But the determination of these numbers is very difficult large numbers of sections have to be examined in order to find the necessary stages and the number of the chromosomes of each stage have to be counted in a considerable number of cells of each species in order to insure accuracy The counting has been done in all cases by selecting those cells in which the chromosomes are most loosely grouped being sure at the same time that all the chromosomes are in the plane of the section drawing the chromosomes carefully with the camera lucida then counting their number on the drawings This demands much patience and time necessitating also constant reexaminations and study of new material though the results may be tabulated in a very small space Of course the difficulties are most pronounced where the chromosomes are numerous and small The material was collected by me at two localitiesin the vicinity of Philadelphia Pennsylvania and in the neighborhood of Woods Holl Massachusetts Great care was taken to insure accurate identification of the species and my specimens were directly compared by me with the collections in the museums of the Wagner Institute of Science and of the Academy of Natural Sciences of this city these collections had been labeled by Dr P R Uhler of Baltimore our foremost American authority on this group of Insects and I must also acknowledge my indebtedness to Dr Uhler for kindly identify ing a number of species which were not represented in the collections just mentioned To my friend Mr C W Johnson curator of the Wagner Institute my tlhanks arealso due for aid in identification The differences of the spermatogenetic phenomena of different species shows how important it is to secure accurate identification The testes were removed as rapidly as possible from the living animals and immedi ately placed in the fixing fluids Flemmings chromoacetoosmic acid mixture the 155MONTGOMERYA STUDY OF THE CHROMOSOMES stronger solution Hermanns chromoacetoplatinic chloride mixture and a picroacetic mixture recommended y Prof Conklin 100 parts saturated aqueous solution of picric acid 100 parts distilled water 6 parts glacial acetic acid being used Of these the mixtures of Flemming and Hermann proved the best for the chromosomal structures for the picroacetic mixture while giving an excellent preservation of the actromatic spindle structures swells the chromosomes very considerably so that on pole views of monaster stages they generally appear closely apposed to one another which makes it difficult to count them Where the species is small it is necessary to remove the testes in the fixa tive under a dissecting microscope The sections were stained either by the ironheema toxylin method of Heidenhain or by the saffraninegentian violet method of Hermann II OBSERVATIONS PENTATOMIDTE 1 Euchistus variolarius Pal Beauv This is the species the spermatogenesis of which I described under the name of Pentatoma  in a former paper 1898 twentyeight testes were studied from adult individuals of all seasons except the winter months In my former paper 1 c I did not find chromatin nucleoli in the spermatogonia I concluded that there was no stage of longitudinal splitting of the chromosomes during the growth period and I concluded that the second maturation division was a reduction mitosis like the first Shortly afterward appeared the papers by Paulmier 1898 1899 on the spermatogenesis of Anasa tristis wherein he showed that there are two chromatin nucleoli his small chromosomes  in the spermatogonia and that these unite in the spermatocytes to form one bivalent one that the chromosomes undergo a longitudinal splitting in the growth period and that the second maturation division is equational In those points wherein I differed from Paulmier I find that Paulmier is correct and that I gave a wrong interpretation to the phenomena in Euchistus I find nothing to correct in the matter of the other points described in my earlier account and here give briefly merely the necessary emendations to my former paper SpermatogoniaIn the resting spermatogonium there are in the nucleus beside the true nucleolus of which there may be more than one two small chromatin nucleoli of rounded form Plate I Fig 1 N 2 With the saffraninegentian violet stain of Her mann when properly used these stain bright red the true nucleolus a faint bluish the chromatin proper a deep violet careful staining and thin sections are necessary to show them plainly Sometimes one or both of them are attached to a true nucleolus In the prophases of mitosis the clromatin nucleoli are easily recognizable by being much smaller 156OF THE GERM CELLS OF METAZOA and more spherical than the chromosomes In the monaster stage in favorable cases where the chromatic elements are not too densely arranged are seen fourteen larger elements the chromosomes proper and two smaller ones regularly rounded in form which are the chromatin nucleoli Figs 2 3 N 2 Sometimes the chromosomes are rounded but since they frequently appear slightly elongate on pole view of the spindle their division in metakinesis must be an equational one In the metakinesis all sixteen elements the fourteen chromosomes and the two chromatin nucleoli are divided so that each daughter cell first spermatocyte receives sixteen elements Thus there are two chromatin nucleoli in the spermatogonia and the chromatin nucleolus of the spermatocystes is not as I had previously described formed by a modifi cation of one of the fourteen chromosomes of the spermatocytes but is derived from the two of the spermatogonia My error was perhaps excusable since in restudying the preparations which were used for my former paper I find that they are not suitably stained to show the chromatin nucleoli in the spermatogonia Growth period of the spermatocytes anaphases of the last spermatogonic division synapsis postsynapsis telophase and restThe fourteen chromosomes in each daughter cell first spermatocyte pass toward the pole of the spindle and become irregular in contour and form Then each becomes longitudinally split Figs 411 This splitting cannot be clearly seen in all preparations and is by no means as clear as in Anasa and certain other Hemiptera the preparations of my former paper were too deeply stained to show it The split commences in the early synapsis stage Fig 4 and is most marked in the postsynapsis Fig 9 and is clearly a single longitudinal split Never do the split halves separate widely from one another as Paulmier found for Anasa but always appear to remain close together and approximately parallel at the most there is a divergence only at the ends of the chromosomes On deep staining the split may be easily over looked The two chromatin nucleoli do not become loose in texture retain their charac teristic red stain with saffranine and join together in the early synapsis to form one dumbbellshaped bivalent one N 2 Figs 4 5 8 10 they do not become longitudi nally split like the chromosomes proper In the early synapsis they are frequently very irregular in form as I showed in my previous paper but the apparent fragmentation of them which I then describeda fragmentation of a single long one into twois not a fragmentation at all but a stage before the two have joined to form one bivalent one Reduction in number of the chromosomesIn my earlier paper I showed that the number of chromosomes is reduced onehalf during the synapsis periodi e long before the maturation divisions I then considered it probable that the reduction in number was effected by a union of chromosomes end to end but was unable to prove this point Since then I have been able to demonstrate that this numerical reduction is effected in 157MONTGOMERYA STUDY OF THE CHROMOSOMES the synapsis by the union into seven pairs of the fourteen chromosomes each of the seven bivalent chromosomes pairs being composed of two univalent chromosomes joined end to end Figs 511 Where the ends of two univalent chromosomes come together is seen a connecting band of linin each bivalent chromosome during the synapsis and postsynapsis is U or Vshaped and the bend or angle of the U or V marks the point of union of two univalent chromosomes the arms of the U or V are longitudinally split In each bivalent chromosome only one end of each univalent chromosome is thus closely connected with one end of the other the opposite ends of the univalent chromosomes having no such linin connections It has been already mentioned that the two chromatin nucleoli come together likewise to form one bivalent one and it can be seen that they are connected by a band of linin In a paper on the spermatogenesis of Peripatus 1901 I showed that it is a particular end of one univalent chromosome which unites with a particular end of another these ends are the ones which point nearest to the pole of the spindle in the anaphase of the last spermatogonic mitosis the  central ends as I have called them in distinction to the opposite or distal ends In Euchistus on the contrary I am unable to determine positively whether it is similar ends of chromosomes which unite because in this form the chromosomes have a much more irregular position within the nucleus the polarity of the nucleus is not so well marked as in Peripatus In the cell body the polarity is as in Peripatus that pole with the greatest amount of cytoplasm and containing the idiozome mass is the distal pole the one which in the dyaster stage of the last spermatogonic division was in the equator of the cell This polarity of the cell body is shown in Figs 4 5 and 8 I figured it also in a number of cases in my previous paper but then errone ously supposed the idiozome mass to occupy that point where the spindle pole had previ ously been whereas I am now able to determine positively that this pole is situated directly opposite namely where the least amount of cytoplasm is situated Now it would appear in Euchistus though not nearly so regularly as in Peripatus that it is the openings of the U or Vshaped bivalent chromosomes that are directed toward the distal pole of the cell body toward the pole where the idiozome mass is placed Figs 4 5 and 8 show this for certain of the chromosomes while other ones as two in Fig 5 may have their openings in opposite directions Thus in Euchistus there is more irregularity in the positions of the axes of the chromosomes so that I have been unable to determine whether it is as in Peripatus only particular ends of the univalent chromosomes which unite with particular ends of others Throughout the growth period can be seen two kinds of linin threads 1 thicker threads which connect the ends of the chromosomes and 2 more delicate ones which join chromatin granules with the nuclear membrane Apparently as I have shown for 158OF THE GERM CELLS OF METAZOA Peripatus the former together with the linin contained in the chromosomes axial threads together constitute a single continuous linin spirem in the nucleus Rest stage of the spermatocytesA rest stage in the growth period preceding the prophases of the maturation mitoses is well marked in Euchistus Fig 12 and Figs 95100 of my preceding paper  though I can confirm Paulmiers observation that such a stage does not occur in Anasa It is characterized by a huge true nucleolus by a rather diffuse and scattered distribution of the chromatin so that chromosomal boundaries are practically indistinguishable and by the diffuse arrangement of a great amount of idiozome substance all around the nucleus so that an idiozome mass with sharp outlines is not present the idiozome mass in the synapsis stage Figs 4 5 8 on the contrary had a sharp and distinct outline The bivalent chromatin nucleolus has now become nearly rounded in form rarely showed a dumbbell shape so that its component parts are very closely apposed It lies peripheral in contact with the nuclear membrane while the true nucleolus lies nearer the centre of the nucleus Sometimes a much smaller rounded body staining like the chromatin nucleolus is also found in the nucleus but what its origin is I have not been able to determine for I have not found it in the spermatogonia though it might well escape detection there on account of its small size As to the terminology adopted by me in my former paper 1898 for the series of stages of the growth period which has been criticised by McClung 1900 the term  metaphase  was I grant used by me incorrectly for I used it for the commencement of the anaphase whereas it is really Strasburgers stage comparable to Flemmings  meta kinesis However the exact use of these terms was explained by me 1898 p 20 In the stages leading up to the resting spermatocyte I distinguished early anaphase  synapsis postsynapsis and telophase as easily recognizable stages in the growth period of Euchistus which need to be characterized by terms for purposes of description McClung I c considers the appearances of the synapsis stage as artefacts it is hardly necessary to reply to this criticism since in all Metozoa where the spermatogenesis has been carefully examined with the exception of certain Amphibia the dense massing of the chromosomes in the synapsis stage has been shown to be a perfectly normal phenome non As to my use of telaphase Heidenhains 1894 p 524 definition is Unter dem Namen Telokinesis beschreibe ich gewisse Bewegungen des Kerns und des Mikrocen trums welche gegen das Ende der Mitose hin stattfinden  iDie zugehorigen Stadien der Mitose bezeichne ich als Telophasen Since Heidenhain employed it for the stage just preceding rest in leucocytes I was warranted in using it for the stage just before the rest stage in the spermatocytes of Euchistus It must be borne in mind in the descrip tion of the changes of the growth period of the germ cells that a peculiar stage the synapsis occurs not found elsewhere in mitosis and that this stage modifies to greater or A P SVOL XX U 159MONTGOMERYA STUDY OF THE CHROMOSOMES less extent according to the object the stages which precede and those which succeed It results from this that the stages of mitosis of the growth period cannot be exactly compared with those of other cells and hence the terms anaphase and telophase can here have a significance only approximately similar to that of other mitoses The maturation divisionsIn the early prophases the longitudinal splitting of the chromosomes is well marked clearer than in preceding stages Figs 13 14 Each chromosome is as before the rest stage clearly bivalent formed of two longitudinally split univalent chromosomes joined so as to make an angle together Figs 1315 and at the bend of the angle is a connecting linin thread These forms of the bivalent chromo somes were clearly figured in my earlier paper except that then I had overlooked the longitudinal split The chromosomes gradually become closer shorter with smoother out lines the longitudinal split gradually becomes hidden and the definitive chromosome with the form of a dumbbell results Figs 1618 In the definitive chromosome there is usually no trace of the longitudinal split except occasionally as a slight indentation at the free end of a univalent component The constriction of the dumbbell marks the point of union of two univalent chromosomes which is effected by a linin band which gener ally never becomes quite hidden In the late prophases just before the disappearance of the nuclear membrane and when the centrosome pairs have reached opposite poles of the nuclear surface a remark able condition of the linin threads is found Fig 17 it was also shown in Figs 152 and 153 of my earlier paper The linin previously in the form of fibres or strands now takes the form of chains of small globulesquite as Van Beneden 1883 had figured for Ascaris I cannot explain this condition but I have found it always at this stage and at this stage only In the first maturation division there are seven bivalent chromosomes and one bival ent chromatin nucleolus and all these elements are divided transversely in metakinesis being placed in the monaster stage so that their constrictions lie in the plane of the equator Fig 18 shows a monaster stage with all these elements on lateral view Fig 19 on pole view this stage was accurately described by me in my former paper so that I have no additions to make to that description Whole univalent chromosomes are separated in the ensuing metakinesis and the univalent components of the chromatin nucleolus are also separated When the daughter chromosomes separate in the anaphlase a constriction or indenta tion appears on them Figs 193201 of my preceding paper This I am now able to prove in agreement with Paulmiers observations on Anasa is the reappearance of the longitudinal split this indentation or constriction becomes placed in the equatorial plane of the monaster stage of the second maturation division so that the latter division divides 160OF THE GERM CELLS OF METAZOA the chromosomes equatorially In the anaphase of the first maturation division the con striction of the chromosomes generally has the appearance shown in Fig 195 of my former paper while Fig 196 which I then considered to represent the typical condition I now from the study of more abundant material find to be an unusual condition That is to say the appearance of the chromosomes shown in Fig 196 of my preceding paper is really atypical since in this case their constrictions appear at right angles to the long axis of the spindle whereas in most other cases the planes of these constrictions coincide with planes passing through the long axis of the spindle In this second maturation division the chromatin nucleolus is not always divided 2 Euchistus tristigmus Say Four testes of this species were studied In the rest stage of the spermatogonium there are two small chromatin nucleoli generally attached to the surface of the true nucleolus In the spermatogonic mitosis there are fourteen chromatin segmenlts in the equatorial plate P1 I Fig 20 the twelve larger usually somewhat elongate ones are chromo somes and the two smallest rounded ones are chromatin nucleoli All these elements are halved in metakinesis In the synapsis stage the twelve chromosomes unite to form six bivalent chromo somes The two chromatin nucleoli sometimes unite to form a bivalent one which is clearly dumbbellshaped in earlier stages but in the resting spermatocyte becomes rounded and has a peripheral position Fig 22 or quite as frequently they remain separate from one another during the growth period and are seen to be of unequal vol umes Fig 21 The chromatin nucleoli in the growth period are rarely attached to the true nucleolus In the first maturation division there are always six clearly bivalent dumbbell shaped chromosomes and either one dumbbellshaped bivalent chromatin nucleolus or apparently more frequently two univalent chromatin nucleoli of more or less rounded form and different volume lateral view shown in Fig 25 N 2 Accordingly on pole views of the monaster stage there are seen either seven chromatin elements Fig 24 which are six bivalent chromosomes and one bivalent chromatin nucleolus or there are eight namely six bivalent chromosomes and two univalent chromatin nucleoli Fig 23 in this figure one of the chromatin nucleoli can be distinguished by its smaller size but which of the remaining seven elements is the other chromatin nucleolus is not easily dis cernible on pole views since the larger of the two chromatin nucleoli has a diameter equal to that of one of the smaller chromosomes All the six chromosomes are halved by a reduction division in metakinesis so that 161MDONTGOMERYA STUDY OF THE CHROMOSOMES in the monaster stage of the second division there are six univalent chromosomes the constrictions of which represent the reappearance of the longitudinal split Fig 26 there are also in the same equatorial plate two nonconstricted bodies of different volumes which are not joined together These are the chromatin nucleoli which are regularly halved in the first maturation metakinesisthat is they are the halves of univalent ones Thus the bodies marked N 2 in Fig 26 are the halves of those similarly marked in Fig 25 The second maturation division is equatorial and the spermatid receives six chro mosomes arranged in an outer circle around a single central chromatin nucleolus Accordingly in this second division one chromatin nucleolus passes undivided into one daughter cell spermatid the other undivided into the other daughter cell As in Euchistus variolarius two follicles of the testis contain spermatocytes of a much larger size than those in the four other follicles 3 Podisus spinosus Dall Five testes of this species were studied In the spermatogonic rest stage there are two small chromiatin nucleoli of more or less rounded form attached to the surface of a true nucleolus In the spermatogonic monaster there are sixteen chromatin segments P1 I Fig 27 two of which probably correspond to the chromatin nucleoli of the previous rest stage In the synapsis the fourteen chromosomes unite to form seven bivalent chromosomes The two chromatin nucleoli also come together to make one bivalent one in the growth period of the spermatocytes Fig 28 the chromatin nucleolus lies close to the nuclear membrane and to its inner surface the true nucleolus is regularly attached In the first maturation monaster there are eight chromatin elements namely sevell chromosomes and one chromatin nucleolus all bivalent and dumbbellshaped on lateral view the chromatin nucleolus has about the same volume as the smaller ones of the chromosomes and so cannot be distinguished from them with certainty 4 Mormidea lugens Fabr Five testes were studied In the rest stage of the spermatogonia there are two chromatin nucleoli P1 I Fig 30 N 2 which may be equal or unequal in size they may be attached together which is apparently the general rule or may be separated and one or both of them may be apposed to the true nucleolus In the spermatogonic monaster there are sixteen chromatin segments two of these 1i62OF THE GERM CELLS OF METAZOA which are smaller than the others and more rounded are the chromatin nucleoli Fig 31  2 In the synapsis the fourteen chromosomes unite to form seven bivalent ones and the two chromatin nucleoli to form one bivalent chromatin nucleolus The latter is periph erally placed in the nucleus and not attached to the true nucleolus Fig 32 In a pole view of the monaster stage of the first maturation division are found eight chromatin elements Fig 33 lateral view shows all are bivalent and dumbbellshaped seven are chromosomes and one easily recognizable by its much smaller size in the chro matin nucleolus Fig 33 N 2 5 Peribalus limbolaris Stal Two testes of this species were studied In the rest stage P1 I Fig 34 and prophases of the spermatogonia are found two chromatin nucleoli of unequal size N 2 and sometimes apparently three they are generally not in mutual contact though they are often apposed to the true nucleoli of which there are frequently two or three In the spermatogonic monaster Fig 35 are sixteen chromatin segments of which the two smallest rounded ones are the chromatin nucleoli the fourteen chromosomes are notably elongated In thle synapsis the fourteen chromosomes unite to form seven bivalent ones and the two chromatin nucleoli to form one bivalent chromatin nucleolus in the rest stage of the spermatocytes Fig 36 the chromatin nucleolus N 2 is usually rounded and peripher ally placed and generally unattached to the relatively very large true nucleolus some times there are two true nucleoli as in Fig 36 rarely three In the rest stage of the spermatocytes there is a smaller chromatin nucleolus in addition to the larger one already described and this smaller may correspond to the third of the chromatin nucleoli found sometimes in the rest stage of the spermatogonia In the monaster stage of the first maturation division there are eight chromatin seg ments Fig 37 namely seven bivalent dumbbellshaped chromosomes and one much smaller bivalent dumbbellshaped chromatin nucleolus 6 Cosmopepla carnifex Fabr Five testes of this species were studied In the monaster stage of the spermatogonia PI I Fig 38 are found eighteen chromatin segments two of these are smaller than the others and so by analogy with other species of this family probably represent chromatin nucleoli N 2 Fig 38 the sixteen other segments are then true chromosomes 163MONTGOMERYA STUDY OF THE CHROMOSOMES In the synapsis stage of the growth period the sixteen chromosomes unite to form eight bivalent chromosomes and the two chromatin nucleoli to form one bivalent chro matin nucleolus The latter is in the rest stage of the spermatocytes rounded and peripheral in position and is not attached to the larger true nucleolus Fig 39 both the nucleolus and the chromatin nucleolus may contain a large clear vacuole which in the former is excentric Pole views of the monaster stage of the first maturation division show nine chroma tin elements Fig 41 and lateral views Fig 40 of the same stage show that all are bivalent and dumbbellshaped The smallest of these elements is the chromatin nucleolus N 2 7 Nezara hilaris Say Five testes of this form were studied There are in the rest stage and early prophases of the spermatogonia two chromatin nucleoli which are comparatively large and usually more or less unequal in size P1 I Figs 42 43 N 2 They are generally peripheral in position and in mutual contact but usually arenot apposed to the true nucleolus N In the spermatogonic monaster there are sixteen chromatin segments Fig 44 of which two can be always recognized by their small size and rounded form as the chroma tin nucleoli the fourteen chromosomes are generally elongated In the synapsis the two chromatin nucleoli unite to form one bivalent one and apparently also the fourteen chromosomes join to make seven bivalent chromosomes but I cannot state this with certainty In the telophase of the spermatocytes Fig 45 the chromatin nucleolus N 2 is peripherally placed and clearly bivalent and usually not in connection with the very large true nucleolus N which is also peripheral In the testes examined all from individuals secured in the month of September were stages only from the resting spermatogonia to the telophase of the spermatocytes all later stages in the spermatogenesis were absent so that the number of the chromosomes in the maturation divisions could not be determined The longitudinal split in the chromosomes during the growth period is unusually distinct in this species 8 Brochymena sp Three testes of this species were studied In the rest stage of the spermatogonia P1 I Fig 46 are two small chromatin nucleoli N 2 which are peripheral in position of nearly equal size generally mutually apposed and seldom attached to the true nucleolus In the spermatogonic monaster stage P1 I Fig 47 are sixteen chromatin segments of which two are smaller and rounded and are the chromatin nucleoliOF THE GERM CELLS OF METAZOA In the synapsis stage the fourteen chromosomes unite to form seven bivalent ones and the two chromatin nucleoli to form one bivalent chromatin nucleolus The latter in the stages following the synapsis is rounded and peripheral in position N 2 Fig 48 P1 II and only occasionally attached to the true nucleolus N Pole views of the first maturation monaster P1 II Fig 49 show eight chromatin segments of which one easily distinguishable from the others by its smaller size is the chromatin nucleolus N 2 Lateral views of this stage show that all eight of these elements are bivalent and dumbbellshaped 9 Perillus confluens HS Two testes of this species were examined The rest stage of the spermatogonia P1 II Fig 50 shows two small rounded chromatin nucleoli of unequal size which are always attached together and may be either close to the nuclear membrane or apposed to the surface of a true nucleolus N In the monaster stage of the spermatogonic divisions are sixteen chromatin segments Fig 51 The fourteen largest are chromosomes the two smallest are chromatin nucleoli N 2 the latter are more minute than in the correspoiinding stage of any other Pentatomid examined by me and on account of their small size cannot always be seen i e in cases where they are closely apposed to the chromosomes In the synapsis stage the fourteen chromosomes unite to form seven bivalent ones and the two chromatin nucleoli to make one bivalent chromatin nucleolus The latter is dumbbellshaped in the earlier stages of the growth period but in the rest stage N 2 Fig 52 becomes oval in outline and it is then attached to the surface of the larger true nucleolus N 2 the two occupying a more or less central position within the nucleus Pole views of the monaster stage of the first maturation division show eight chromatin segments of varying diameter Fig 53 one of these probably the smallest is the chromatin nucleolus lateral views show that all these elements are bivalent and dumb bellshaped 10 Conus delius Say Three testes of this species were studied In the rest stage of the spermatogonia there are two chromatin nucleoli with irreg ular outlines P1 II Fig 54 N 2 and they are situated usually close together In the spermatogonic monaster stage Fig 55 there are fourteen chromatin seg ments the two smallest of which are probably the chromatin nucleoli N 2 leaving twelve chromosomes In the synapsis stage the twelve chromosomes unite to form six bivalent ones The 165MONTGOMERYA STUDY OF THE CHROMOSOMES two chromatin nucleoli found in the spermatogonia also unite to form one bivalent chromatin nucleolus this is clearly bilobed in the earlier stages but more rounded in the later stages of the growth period of the spermatocytes the larger of the bodies designated N 2 in Figs 57 58 63 there is attached to it usually a small true nucleolus Fig 58 Besides this large bivalent chromatin nucleolus there is also found in the spermatocytes most clearly seen in the rest stage another much smaller one of rounded form the smaller of the bodies marked N 2 in Figs 57 58 63 this is almost always apposed to one of the true nucleoli N of which there are generally two large ones besides the small one attached to the large chromatin nucleolus quite frequently the small chro matin nucleolus lies between the large one and a large true nucleolus Fig 63 This small chromatin nucleolus is difficult to see in the synapsis stage when the chromosomes stain deeply and since I was also unable to find it in the monaster stage of the sperma togonia I could not determine whether it is bivalent or univalent or what its earlier history is It might well be present however in the spermatogonia but be there so minute as to escape detection Pole views of the monaster stage of the first maturation division show sometimes only seven chromatin segments Fig 62 and then these are six bivalent chromosomes and the large bivalent chromatin nucleolus or they show eight segments Figs 59 60 of which the smallest is the small chromatin nucleolus of the growth period That is to say in the equatorial plate there are always six bivalent chromlosomes and the large bivalent chromatin nucleolus while the small chromatin nucleolus may be present or may be absent The lateral view of this stage given here Fig 61 shows seven large dumb bellshaped elements ot which six are chromosomes and one the bivalent chromatin nucleolusthough which one it would be hard to say for all of these elements are of approximately equal size and similar form while the smallest eighth element marked N 2 in this figure is the small chromatin nucleolus When the latter persists into this stage it appears to be halved in the following metakinesis II Trichopepla semivittata Say Four testes of this species were studied In the nucleus of the resting spermatogonium are seen clearly two rounded chro matin nucleoli N 2 Fig 64 P1 II of different volumes one or both frequently apposed to a larger true nucleolus N In the monaster stage of the spermatogonia are found sixteen chromatin segments of which fourteen are elongate chromosomes and two which are smaller and rounded are the chromatin nucleoli N 2 Fig 65 which here as in the preceding rest stage are unequal in size 166OF THE GERM CELLS OF METAZOA In the following synapsis stage the fourteen chromosomes join to form seven bivalent ones The two chromatin nucleoli likewise unite to form one bivalent one of which the two components are unequal in size Fig 66 N 2 In the telophase and rest stage of the spermatocytes the chromatin nucleolus loses its earlier bipartite form and becomes rounded the larger of the bodies marked N 2 in Fig 67 and only occasionally is it apposed to the larger true nucleolus N Sometimes the two chromatin nucleoli derived from the spermatogonia do not unite together but remain separated During the growth period its later stages at least can be seen in each nucleus three or four much smaller rounded bodies which stain like the chromatin nucleoli some of them are often attached to the surface of the true nucleolus Fig 67 the three smaller bodies designated N 2 There are certainly three of them and in some nuclei apparently four I was unable to determine with certainty these small chromatin nucleoli in the rest and division stages of the spermatogonia though they might well be present there but escape observation on account of their minuteness The monaster stage of the first maturation division Figs 68 69 shows eight larger bivalent dumbbellshaped chromatin segments of which seven are chromosomes and one the large chromatin nucleolus N 2 of the figures Of the seven chromosomes one is always longer and more voluminous than the others Figs 68 69 and is probably the derivative of the two largest chromosomes found in the spermatogonic divisions Fig 65 Besides these eight large elements of the monaster stage of the reduction division there may be seen on pole view usually one Fig 68 sometimes two much smaller granules which evidently represent the small chromatin nucleoli found in the growth period SCUTELLARIIDE 12 Eurygaster alternatus Say Three testes of this form were studied from individuals taken in July and August Each testis was filled with spermatocytes and spermatids but contained no spermatogonia In the spermatocyte in the rest stage one bilobed and hence probably bivalent chromatin nucleolus N 2 Fig 70 PI II which is peripheral in position and separated from the usually smaller true nucleolus N Sometimes the two components of this chromatin nucleolus do not join together in the synapsis but remain separated through the growth period In the monaster stage of the first maturation division Fig 71 pole view are found seven dumbbellshaped and hence probably bivalent chromatin segments of which the smallest is undoubtedly the chromatin nucleolus N 2 so that here there would be six bivalent chromosomes A P sVOL XX v 167MONTGOMERYA STUDY OF THE CHROMOSOMES COREIDE 13 Anasa tristis De G Twentyone testes of this species were studied In regard to the chromosomal numbers my observations confirm those of Paulmier In the rest stage of the spermatogonium PI II Figs 72 73 there are two chro matin nucleoli N 2 which are much smaller than the true nucleoli N to which they are generally apposed They have definite irregularly rounded or oval outlines as examined with Hermanns saffraninegentian violet stain and are not  hazy  or  indefi nite  as Paulmier 1899 described Both may be attached to the same nucleolus or they may be joined to separate nucleoli Sometimes each one may separate into two pieces as is the case with one in Fig 72 They are best seen on iron haematoxylin preparations so strongly destained that the chromatin reticulum does not appear In the monaster stage of the spermatogonia Fig 74 are twentytwo chromatin seg ments namely twenty larger chromosomes and two much smaller chromatin nucleoli N 2 In the synapsis stage the twenty chromosomes unite to form ten bivalent ones and the two chromatin nucleoli to form one bivalent one The latter is clearly bipartite in the synapsis but later shows an oval outline Fig 75 it is peripheral in position often contains a central clearer vacuole as in the Pentatomidce and is as a rule separated from the true nucleolus N In the monaster stage of the first maturation division pole view Fig 76 are found eleven bivalent dumbbellshaped chromatin segments of which the central smallest one is the chromatin nucleolus N 2 I am able to confirm Paulmiers 1899 account of the two maturation divisions 14 Anasa armigera Say One testis of this species was studied The spermatogenesis seems to be very similar to that of the preceding species but as I had no preparation stained with saffraninegentian violet I was unable to determine the relations of the chromatin nucleoli in the rest stage of the spermatogonia Fig 77 P1 II shows a pole view of a monaster stage of the spermatogonia with twenty chromosomes and two chromatin nucleoli N 2 it is very similar to the corre sponding stage in Anasa tristis Fig 74 In the synapsis are formed ten bivalent chromosomes and one bivalent chromatin inuleolus In the monaster of the first maturation division Fig 78 are ten bivaleat chromo 168OF THE GERM CELLS OF METAZOA somes and one bivalent chromatin nucleolus Fig 78 is a pole view but in it those elements which appear dumbbellshaped are seen from the side 15 Anasa sp Of this undetermined species which was collected for me at Berryessa in California I examined nine testes The resting spermatogonium shows two chromatin nucleoli P1 II Fig 79 N 2 which are comparatively large and rather loose in texture generally irregular in outline occasionally attached to the true nucleolus N and more or less central in position In the monaster stage of the spermatogonia Fig 80 are twentytwo chromatin segments namely twenty larger chromosomes and two smaller chromatin nucleoli N 2 In the synapsis the chromosomes unite to form ten bivalent ones and the chromatin nucleoli to form one bivalent one In the rest stage of the spermatocytes Fig 81 the chromatin nucleolus N 2 is seen to be somewhat elongate in form is peripheral in position and not attached to the true nucleolus NI In the monaster stage of the first maturation division are eleven bivalent elements of which the smallest is the chromatin nucleolus N 2 Fig 82 in this figure we do not have strictly pole views of all the chromosomes Fig 83 shows four of the bivalent chromosomes on lateral view in a paratongential section of a cell in the stage of the first maturation monaster It is given here because it is the clearest case I have noticed in any Hemipteron of the quadripartite nature of these chromosomes for while the transverse split may generally be seen at this stage the longitudinal split is generally hidden The poles of the spindle not in the plane of this section but seen in the next one to it are situated at the upper and lower portions of the figure respectively and it is hardly necessary to add that the first maturation division coincides with the plane of the transverse split the second with the plane of the longi tudinal split 16 Metapodius terminalis Dall Eleven testes were studied of this species which is very favorable on account of the large size of the cells one should examine testes from individuals taken in June or early July before the time of copulation In the rest stage of the spermatogonia P1 II Fig 84 are two chromatin nucleoli N 2 of very small size and smooth outlines generally close together on the surface of a true nucleolus N In the spermatogonic monaster Fig 85 are twentytwo chromatin segments of which the two smallest are chromatin nucleoli N 2 and easily recognizable 169MONTGOMERYA STUDY OF THE CHROMOSOMES In the synapsis the twenty chromosomes unite to form ten bivalent ones and the two chromatin nucleoli to form one bivalent one The latter is in later stages of the growth period bilobed N 2 Fig 86 is peripheral in position and not opposed to the larger true nucleolus N In the monaster stage of the first maturation division are eleven chromatin segments Fig 87 of which the smallest centrally placed one is the chromatin nucleolus N 2 all these elements are bivalent and on lateral view they all show the dumbbellshape 17 Chariesterus antennator Fabr Two testes of this form were examined In the rest stage of the spermatogonia I could not be certain of the presence of chro matin nucleoli for my preparations were not very well stained to demonstrate them There were also no spermatogonic monasters favorable enough for determining the num ber of chromosomes In the synapsis stage there is a bivalent chromatin nucleolus but sometimes its com ponent parts are widely separated In the telophase of the spermatocytes PI II Fig 88 the chromatin nucleolus N 2 is peripheral in position sometimes its two univalent components still separated but that is not the case in Fig 88 The true nucleolus N is sometimes central sometimes peripheral in position and occasionally it is apposed to the chromatin nucleolus In the monaster of the first maturation division Fig 89 lateral view Fig 90 pole view are found thirteen chromatin segments of which the smallest centrally placed one is the bivalent chromatin nucleolus N 2 Of the twelve chromosomes at least eleven would seem to be bivalent having the characteristic dumbbellshape but in the lateral view here given Fig 89 it will be noted that the chromosome nearest the lefthand side does not appear dumbbellshaped This may be a bivalent one seen obliquely or it may be a univalent one which is the case I cannot determine since there were few satisfactory lateral views on the preparations and since the number of chromosomes in the spermatogonia could not be determined 18 Alydus pilosulus H S Four testes of this species were studied The chromatin nucleoli in the rest stage of the spermatogonia N 2 Fig 91 P1 II are two in number and rounded they are very small usually close together and may be or not be attached to the true nucleolus N In the spermatogonic monaster stage Fig 92 are fourteen chrolnatin segments two 170OF THE GERM CELLS OF METAZOA of which easily distinguishable from the others by their small size are chromatin nucleoli N 2 In the synapsis stage the twelve chromosomes unite to form six bivalent ones and the two chromatin nucleoli to form one bivalent one In the late stages of the growth period Figs 93 94 the chromatin nucleolus N 2 is rounded and peripheral in posi tion and usually apposed to the true nucleolus even when they are separated the latter is usually peripheral 1N Fig 94an unusual position for it in spermatocytes of Hemiptera In the monaster stage of the first maturation division Fig 95 are seven elements namely six bivalent chromosomes and one bivalent chromatin nucleolus the smallest of the seven elements N 2 all these are dumbbellshaped on lateral view and though Fig 95 is a pole view of the spindle two of its chromosomes are seen from the side 19 Alydus eurinus Say One testis of this species was studied In the rest stage of the spermatogonia I could not determine chromatin nucleoli probably on account of their small size Numerous monaster stages of spermatogonia were examined and all showed thirteen chromatin elements P1 III Fig 96 two of these which are readily recognizable from the others by their minute size are chromatin nucleoli the two small granules shown in Fig 96 the eleven large elements are chromosomes and have mostly an elongated form In the synapsis the two chromatin nucleoli unite to form one bivalent one which in the telophase of the spermatocytes N 2 Fig 97 is relatively small peripheral in posi tion and quite frequently apposed to the larger true nucleolus N Of the eleven uni valent chromosomes derived from the spermatogonium ten unite to form five bivalent pairs while one the eleventh does not unite with any of the others but remains uni valent In the first maturation division are found seven chromatin elements Fig 98 pole view the smallest of these is bivalent dumbbellshaped and is the chromatin nucleolus N 2 the six larger elements are chromosomes Now a careful study of numerous monaster stages seen on lateral view shows that only five of these chromosomes are dumb bellshaped and so bivalent on analogy with what is known for the other femiptera while one of them is never dumbbellshaped approximately half the volume of the others and is univalent Fig 99 is a lateral view of the spindle of the first maturation division showing three of the five dumbbellshaped chromosomes and most to the right the univalent chromosome In all cases where the chromosome plates of this stage can 171MONTGOMERYA STUDY OF THE CHROMOSOMES be seen on lateral view one chromosome is always found to be of about half the size of the others and not dumbbellshaped on pole views this chromosome can be distin guished by its lesser depth So in Alydus eurinus there is an uneven number of chromosomes in the spermato gonia namely eleven the reduction in number is effected then in the synapsis by ten combining to form five bivalent ones while one remains univalent and uncombined because there is no mate with which it can unite In the monaster of the second maturation division there are either six or seven chromatin elements In Fig 100 of this stage are shown seven of which the smallest is probably the chromatin nucleolus five are halves of the originally bivalent chromosomes and one probably the half of the originally univalent chromosome In the spermatid we find either six Fig 102 or five Fig 101 chromatin elements of approximately equal volume Now these elements are too large to be derivatives of the chromatin nucleolus of the spermatocyte of the first order N 2 Fig 98 so that the five or six elements of the spermatids would not seem to represent portions of this chro matin nucleolus very probably the latter is so small in the spermatids or generally so closely applied to the surface of one of the chromosomes that it escapes observation If we then eliminate the possibility of any of the elements shown in the spermatids Figs 101 102 representing chromatin nucleoli or their derivatives then we must conclude that the five or six elements here are chromosomes But why is their number sometimes five in other cases six Now we know that in all other Hemiptera in which attention has been given to this point that each spermatid receives onequarter of each of the bivalent chromosomes present in the spermatocyte of the first order Accordingly it would be probable by analogy that in Alydus eurinus the spermatid receives onequarter of each of the original five bivalent chromosomes Then in the case of Fig 101 all five elements would be such derivatives in Fig 102 five of the six elements The sixth element of Fig 102 is then probably the original univalent chromosomes of the first maturation division which in either the first or the second maturation division could not have been divided but must have passed undivided into one of the daughter cells this would explain why sometimes there are only five sometimes six chromosomes in the spermatid for as I have explained none of the elements of Figs 101 and 102 can be regarded as chromatin nucleoli Of course the preceding is only an attempt at a right interpretation I have not been able to follow the univalent chromosome with precision in regard to its behavior in the maturation divisions 20 Corizus lateralis Say Four testes of this species were studied I could not determine whether there are chromatin nucleoli in the rest stage of the 172OF THE GERM CELLS OF METAZOA spermatogonia and none of the cases of spermatogonic monasters in my preparations were sufficiently favorable to allow accurate counting of the chromatin elements In the growth period of the spermatocytes a comparatively small bivalent chromatin nucleolus which in the rest stage N 2 Fig 103 P1 III has a peripheral position and rounded form and is not apposed to the true nucleolus N Besides this chromatin nucleolus one or two much smaller rounded ones can sometimes be seen in the nuclei of tle resting spermatocytes and these stain like the large one with the double stain of Hermann In the monaster stage of the first maturation division are always found at least seven chromatin elements when there are eight the eighth is a small granule Fig 105 the smaller of the bodies marked N 2 and this small element which frequently cannot be seen at this stage probably represents one of the minute chromatin nucleoli of the growth period Of the seven larger elements the smallest centrally placed one is the bivalent chromatin nucleolus N 2 Fig 104 and the larger of the elements marked N 2 in Fig 105 this chromatin nucleolus often has its component halves separated except for a joining linin band before the period of metakinesis Fig 106 The remaining six elements are chromosomes and of them four are of approximately equal volume while one is always much larger and one always much smaller than these four pole views Figs 104 105 lateral view Fig 106 The five largest chromosomes are clearly dumbbellshaped on lateral view and accordingly by analogy with the corre sponding elements of other Hemiptera may be considered bivalent even though the number in the spermatogonia was not determined But the smallest chromosome puzzled me at first with regard to its valence for it is not more than half the volume of the other five and sometimes it does not appear dumbbellshaped so that I considered the possi bility of its being univalent but a careful study of it in numerous cells of the first maturation division resulted in showing in a number of clear cases that it is transversely constricted even before it becomes arranged in the plane of the equator so that there can hardly be a doubt as to its being bivalent Fig 106 shows such a case in an oblique lateral view of the spindle before the chromosomes have become arranged all in one plane with a wellmarked constriction of the smallest chromosome The first maturation division is a reduction division and always halves the six chro mosomes and the bivalent chromatin nucleolus 21 Harmostes reflexulus Stal Thirteen testes of this species were studied In the rest stage of the spermatogonia there are two rounded chromatin nucleoli N 2 Fig 107 PI III of which one or both may be apposed to the true nucleolus NV 173MONTGOMERYA STUDY OF THE CHROMOSOMES In the monaster stage of the spermatogonic divisions can always be counted thirteen chromatin segments on favorable pole viewsi e in such cases where these elements can be seen all in one plane and where they are not too closely apposed to one another Figs 108110 Two of these elements are always distinguishable from the others by their smaller size and rounded shape and these are the chromatin nucleoli N 2 they may lie close together Fig 110 but more usually are more separated in position Figs 108 109 The remaining eleven elements which are of large size and elongate form are chromosomes There can be no doubt that this is the actual number of these chro mosomes for no exceptions to it were found and in fourteen clear cases from four different testes the number eleven was obtained with great clearness these chromosomes are larger than the spermatogonic chromosomes of any other Hemipteron examined Sometimes one or more of the chromosomes may show a slight transverse constriction but this is not a constant appearance In the synapsis the two chromatin nucleoli derived from the spermatogonium unite to form one bivalent one in the rest stage which is very complete of the spermatocyte it is elongate N 2 Fig 111 peripheral in position and not attached to the true nucleolus the latter is larger N Fig 111 frequently peripheral in position and sometimes two true nucleoli are present During the synapsis stage ten of the eleven chromosomes join to form five bivalent chromosomes while the eleventh remains univalent as will become evident from the following description In the first maturation division are found either seven chromatin elements or eight chromatin elements these two conditions may be described successively When there are seven elements Fig 112 pole view of the monaster stage Fig 113 lateral view one may always be distinguished by its smaller size and central position and by its history from the rest stage of the spermatocyte to the stage under discussion this is found to be the chromatin nucleolus N 2 this we have already learned to be bivalent and in Fig 113 its univalent components are seen to be separating The six larger elements are chromosomes Five of these as Fig 113 shows are clearly dumbbell shaped and bivalent The sixth however x never shows a dumbbell shape before the metakinesis but is always distinguishable from the others by its oval form From these appearances we must conclude that this sixth chromosome is univalentrepresents the odd eleventh chromosome of the spermatogonic monaster stage which had no mate with which to unite during the following synapsis stage It was in this species that I first found spermatogonia with an uneven number of chromosomes so that I first concluded they must be abnormal cases for heretofore in all objects the spermatogonic normal number has been described as an even one I immediately sectioned testes of other 174OF THE GERM CELLS OF METAZOA individuals to determine this point but as has been already stated in the four of the thirteen testes which contained spermatogonic divisions exactly eleven chromosomes were found to be always present Obviously all of the eleven chromosomes cannot unite into pairs during the synapsis one must remain unmated and this must be necessarily that one of the first maturation division which does not appear bipartite Now in those cases where there are eight chromatin elements present in the sperma tocytes the question becomes more complicated Figs 114116 Here as in the cases where there are seven elements one is central in position and distinguishable from the others by its smaller volume namely the bivalent chromatin nucleolus N 2 Figs 114116 in the last figure its univalent components separated the remaining seven elements are then chromosomes As the lateral view Fig 116 of the spindle shows four of these are bivalent the ones not marked by lettering One x is oval in form show ing no constriction or splitting and so is probably comparable to the univalent chromo some of those cells which contain but seven chromatin elements i e to x in Fig 113 There then remain the two elements marked a in Fig 116 and each of these I conclude must be a univalent chromosome which in cases where there are only seven chromatin elements in the spindle would have combined with the other to form one bivalent chromo some if this be so then tle transverse constriction of the lefthand chromosome marked a in Fig 116 would not be the line of separation between two univalent chromosomes Another reason for looking upon these two chromosomes as univalent is because they are of approximately the same volume as the chromosome marked x which we have shown to be univalent by comparison with the chromosome x of Fig 113 But there is a still better reason for considering the elements a of Fig 116 to be univalent chromosomes A pole view of a corresponding stage with eight chromatin elements shows the seven chromosomes frequently equidistant from one another as in Fig 115 But often we find on pole view two of the seven chromosomes close together and connected by a band of linin a Fig 114 the two together constitute a virtual bivalent chromosome which however differs from the other bivalent ones in having its long axis parallel to the plane of the equator of the spindle Let the band of linin which connects these chromosomes a become stretched out and as a result we would have a bivalent chromosome lying parallel to the plane of the equator and with its univalent halves widely separatedi e the condition that maintains for the chromosomes a of Fig 116 To summarize we find two conditions in the spermatocytes 1 there are seven chromatin elements namely one bivalent chromatin nucleolus five bivalent chromo somes and one univalent chromosome and 2 eight chromatin elements namely one bivalent chromatin nucleolus four bivalent chromosomes one univalent chromosome corresponding to that of condition 1 and two other univalent chromosomes which A P SVOL XX W 175VIONTGOMERYA STUDY OF THE CHROMOSOMES together would correspond to the fifth bivalent chromosome of condition 1 To deter mine which of these conditions is the more usual I counted the number of chromatin elements seen on pole views of the monaster stage of the first maturation division These counts were made on spermatocytes from five different testes and may be condensed into the following table PREPARATION NO EIGHT ELEMENTS SEVEN ELEMENTS 86 4 33 238 6 12 408 2 1 410 1 9 356 0 23 Total  13 78 Thus those spermatocytes with seven chromatin elements would seem to be the more frequent condition In both cases there is one univalent chromosome which represents the odd chromosome of the spermatogonia but why in cells of the second condition two chromosomes should remain separated instead of combining to form a bivalent one as they do in the first condition I cannot explain unless perhaps the presence of the odd uni valent chromosome may in some way disturb the union into pairs of the ten other chro mosomes during the synapsis In those cases where there are seven chromatin elements in the equator of the first maturation spindle the Inetakinesis results in the division of all the elements this is a reduction transverse division of the bivalent chromatin nucleolus and of the five bival ent chromosomes but in what plane the univalent chromosome divides could not be de termined Only one case was seen where the univalent chromosome was left undivided in the equator after the daughter elements of the six other elements had reached opposite poles of the spindle Thus it would seem that in this division in the cases where there are seven elements present all the elements become divided how it is in the cases where there are eight elements could not be determined In the spermatid are found either six chromosomes Fig 117 and one chromatin nucleolus N 2 or five chromosomes and one chromatin nucleolus This would show that the chromatin nucleolus and five chro mosomes the derivatives of the original five bivalent ones divide in thle second matura tion division but that the sixth chromosome the derivative of the originally univalent one does not divide but passes undivided into one of the two spermatids Thus the valence of the seven elements in these generations would be first spermatocyte one bivalent chromatin nucleolus five bivalent chromosomes one univalent chromosome 176OF THE GERM CELLS OF METAZOA second spermatocyte one univalent chromatin nucleolus five univalent chromosomes one semivalent chromosome spermatid one semivalent chromatin nucleolus and either five or six semivalent chromosomes 22 Protenor belfragei Hagl Five testes of this exceedingly interesting species were studied from individuals that had just completed their last ekdysis In the rest stage of the spermatogonia P1 III Fig 118 are two rounded chroma tin nucleoli which are usually attached to the surface of a much larger true nucleolus N Pole views of the monaster stage of the spermatogonic mitosis show with great dis tinctness exactly thirteen chromatin elements Figs 119123 This number was found in thirteen cells of one testis in about sixteen cells of a second in six cells of a third and in two cells of a fourththese being all the favorable cases found and all these testes had been fixed with Flemmings fluid the stronger mixture The fifth testis sectioned had been fixed in picroacetic acid and in it the number of chromosomes could not be counted because of the swelling action which this reagent exerts upon the chroma tin These chromosomes are unusually large and on suitable preparations can be counted with exactness In only two of the cells in which they were counted was there observed a fourteenth element this was a minute granule t Fig 121 which on accounlt of its being present so rarely in these monaster stages and on account of there being no element to represent it in the later history of the spermatogenesis need not be taken into account it seems to be very inconstant and might possibly represent either a portion of chromatin which had become separated from one of the chromosomes or a chromatin nucleolus transmitted from some distant parentand now nearly reaching disappearance Which two of the elements in the spermatogonic monaster represent the chromatin nucleoli of the previous rest stage I am unable to determine but that two of them do represent these bodies there can be no doubt from what has been determined for the suc ceeding stages judging by analogy with the case in all other Coreidce examined they would probably be the two smallest elements Now Figs 119123 show what is to be seen very distinctly in all cases namely that there are three chromatin elements much larger than the ten remaining One of these three that designated x in Figs 119123 imposes by its relatively very large volume this has in most cases the form shown in Figs 120 and 121 but in a few cases it was noticeably elongated as in Figs 122 and 123 The last figure shows it to have a transverse constriction around thle middle and this case together with the fact of its great volume would show it to be equal potentially to at last two chromosomas for purposes of description we shall call this the  chromo some x The two other chromosomes which can always be recognized by their relatively 177MONTGOMERYA STUDY OF THE CHROMOSOMES large volume are those designated by the letter k in Figs 119123 these two are of approximately equal volume and each has about half the volume of the chromosome x There are accordingly present in the spermatogonic monaster thirteen chromatin elements of which two probably the smallest represent the chromatin nucleoli of the eleven chromosomes three are much larger than the others namely the one marked x and the two marked k in the Figs 119123 In the metakinesis all these elements are halved longitudinally In the following synapsis stage we find a small chromatin nucleolus composed of two parts which in every way is comparable to the bivalent chromatin nucleolus of the growth period of other Coreidce this is marked N 2 in Figs 124 129 130 This chromatin nucleolus is peripheral in position and only occasionally has a true nucleolus apposed to it Fig 130 Generally its two univalent halves are not closely apposed but more or less separated often widely separated N 2 Fig 131 but the two always come close together to form a dumbbellshaped bivalent body before the monaster stage of the first maturation division Certainly its two components must represent the two univalent chromatin nucleoli of the rest stage of the spermatogonia N 2 Fig 118 During the synapsis stage also ten out of the eleven chromosomes derived from the spermatogonium combine to form five bivalent chromosomes as will be shown in treating of the maturation divisions The odd one of the eleven chromosomes does not combine with any other during the synapsis stage and this is the largest of the chromosomes of the spermatogonium namely the chromosome x This element has a remarkable history in the growth period Through the whole growth period it acts like a chromatin nucle olus in preserving a compact form and in continuing to take the saffranine stain with the use of the double stain of Hermann while the other chromosomes take the violet stain It will be remembered that this chromosome x becomes distinguishable first in the sperma togonic mitoses Figs 119123 while in the preceding spermatogonic rest stage it cannot be distinguished for then it takes the violet stain like the other chromosomes and takes part in the formation of the nuclear riticulum just as they do accordingly it can be concluded that it commences to behave differently from the other chromosomes at the beginning of the growth period of the spermatocyte In the early synapsis Fig 124 it has the same general shape as in the spermatogonic monaster stage compare the ele ment marked x in Fig 124 with the corresponding one in Figs 120 121 but it has greatly increased in volume as a comparison of these figures show since it will be recalled that the chromosome x of the spermatccytes is a half of the chromosome x of the sperma togonia Later in the growth period the chromosome x elongates into the form of a bent rod Figs 125130 which usually lies close to the nuclear membrane in this point also resembling a chromatin nucleolus throughout the growth period it keeps its com 178OF THE GERM CELLS OF METAZOA pact structure and smooth outline When it is beginning to elongate a faintlymarked clear line can be seen in its long axis Figs 125 129 and this is evidently a longitudi nal split comparable to that of the bivalent chromosomes this split cannot be seen in the telophase nor at any period of the maturation divisions About coincidently appears a transverse split this may be a simple annular constriction or a clear con necting bridge of linin as in Fig 128 This transverse constriction pointing to a bipartite nature would show that the chromosome x is bivalent but it must have been already bivalent in the spermatogonia where also a transverse constriction can some times be seen Fig 123 for it does not unite with any other chromosome in the sperma tocytes I can find no other explanation for its occasional bipartite appearance during the synapsis In the later period of the synapsis stage in the telophase and in the early prophases of the first maturation division the chromosome x undergoes considerable changes in form The slightly bent rod Figs 125 129 of the early synapsis bends at its middle point where the transverse constriction was apparent into the form of a U or V Figs 126 127 130 or even the form of an S Fig 127b The end result of these bendings seems always to be a horseshoeshape Fig 130 or a nearly closed ring Fig 127c From the early synapsis stage until the beginning of the prophases of the first maturation mitosis a true nucleolus of varying form is attached to the surface of the chromosome x N Figs 124 125 127130 occasionally this true nucleolus may be separated into two or three parts all of them attached to the chromosome In the prophases of the first maturation division the nucleolus becomes detached from the chromosome rapidly decreases in size and becomes lost before the nuclear membrane disappears In the early prophases of the first maturation division Figs 131 132 are found the following elements 1 five bivalent chromosomes of which all five are shown in Fig 132 only four in Fig 131 all these seen on lateral view all these show at this stage a wellmarked longitudinal split often of circular or oval outline and a trans verse split which marks the point of union of two univalent chromosomes the mode of formation of these elements is very similar to that described by Paulmier 1899 for Anasa 2 The bivalent chromatin nucleolus the two parts of which may be in close contact V 2 Fig 132 or may still be widely separated N 2 Fig 131 And 3 the large chroniosome x the largest of all the elements which now has decreased some what in volume owing to the greater condensation of its substance seen from the side it gives the appearance of a thick horseshoe or a nearly closed ring x Fig 131 Of the five bivalent chromosomes one is always much larger than the others K 2 Figs 131 132 and this was evidently formed by the union of the two large chromosomes K of the spermatogonic mitoses Figs 119123 179MONTGOMERYA STUDY OF THE CHROMOSOMES In the later prophases Figs 133 134 the five bivalent chromosomes condense into the form of dumbbells or sometimes of rings the large chromosome K 2 Fig 133 passing through these stages more slowly than the others so that it often retains loose texture and roughened outlines after the four others have become compact with smooth outlines The bivalent chromatin nucleolus now has its univalent components generally in rather close apposition N 2 Figs 133 134 The chromosome x is very compact in structure and when seen from the side has squarish form x Fig 133 an indentation at one end of which marks the point of apposition of the ends of the primitive horse shoe formwhich latter in some cases Fig 134 may still be seen at this late stage Usually the chromosome x is longer than broad and the clear line sometimes found in its long axis does not then represent the primitive longitudinal split of which there seems no trace at this stage but the space separating the two arms of the horseshoe In the monaster stage of the first maturation mitosis Figs 135137 there are accordingly seven elements in the cell from which Fig 136 was drawn one of the bivalent chromosomes lay out of the plane of the section These are the bivalent chromatin nucleolus N 2 the smallest of all the chromosome x x the largest of all and five bivalent chromosomes of which one is almost always recognizable by its greater volume K 2 and this is the bivalent chromosome formed by the synapsis of the two larger chromosomes Kof the spermatogonia The five bivalent chromosomes and the chromatin nucleolus become divided transversely in the metakinesis reduction division The chromosome x for successive stages in its division Figs 136 138 which has its long axis coinciding with the plane of the equator becomes divided into two along its median axis This would appear at first sight to be a longitudinal equational division but it is not for we have learned that this peculiar chromosome had first the form of a straight rod which then bent at its middle point into a U or V then the arms of the U or V laid themselves parallel to and close together so that a division along the median axis results now in the separation of these arms and is accordingly a reduction division A view of the second spermatocyte before its chromatin elements have definitely arranged themselves in the plane of the equator of the spindle shows also seven elemnents Fig 139 one univalent chromatin nucleolus N 2 one chromosome larger than tlhe others a half of the original chromosome x x 1 and five univalent chromosonmes one K larger than the others and directly comparable to one of the large chromosomes K of the spermatogonia In the metakinesis following Fig 140 the five univalent chromo somes are divided equationally and the univalent chromatin nucleolus N 2 is also divided but in what plane was not determined The chromosome x 1 however never becomes divided in this mitosis but passes undivided into one of the daughter cells Fig 180OF THE GERM CELLS OF METAZOA 140 and in the dyaster stage of the second maturation division Fig 141 we see in each daughter cell spermatid the chromosomes densely apposed forming together a rounded irregular mass and in only one of the two daughter cells the chromosome x  The reduction of the number of chromatin elements in Protenor belfragei is accord ingly as follows Spermatogonium two univalent chroinatin nucleoli ten univalent chromosomes one chromosome x first spermatocyte one bivalent chromatin nucleolus five bivalent chromosomes one chromosome x second spermatocyte one univalent chromatin nucleolus five univalent chromosomes onehalf chromosome x spermatid one semivalent chromatin nucleolus five semivalent chromosomes and either present or absent onehalf chromosome x This chromosome x is the odd one of the spermato gonia it does not unite with any other one in the synapsis stage of the spermatocyte yet since it sometimes appears bipartite in the synapsis and undergoes a transverse divi sion in the first maturation mitosis it may perhaps be looked upon as bivalent in both spermatogonium and spermatocyte If this is a correct conclusion then the uneven number of chromosomes in the spermatogonia would be the result of two univalent ones remaining there united instead of separatingthis compound bivalent one being the chromosome x This chromosome as we have seen behaves in the rest stage of the spermatogonia like the other chromosomes but in the growth period of the spermatocytes it acts in many ways like a chromatin nucleolus LYGAEIDiE 23 Cymus augustatus Stal Six testes of this species were studied There was no mnaterial at my service fixed with Flemmings or Hermanns fluids so not being able to use the triple stain of Hermann I was unable to determine the relations of the chromatin nucleoli in the rest stage of the spermatogonia The preparations also showed no favorable cells for counting the chromosomes in this generation In the synapsis stage there is a rather small dumbbellshaped and so probably bivalent chromatin nucleolus which becomes spherical in the following complete rest stage of the spermatocyte There were no pole views of the chromosomal plate of the first maturation division but two pole views of the succeeding dyaster are here given P1 IV Fig 143 showing the chromosomes before taking their definite position in the spindle while in Fig 144 they occupy this position and are seen from their ends here can be counted twelve chromosomes and one smaller body N 2 probably the chromatin nucleolus very small ini Fig 144 On lateral views of the first maturation monaster Fig 142 which how ever shows only nine of the elements all the chromosomes usually appear dumbbell 181MONTGOMERYA STUDY OF THE CHROMOSOMES shaped and so would be bivalent Sometimes one of them appears rounded or oval instead of dumbbellshaped this may be a bivalent one seen obliquely or it might possibly be a univalent one the lack of knowledge of the spermatogonic number does not permit us to decide which 24 Ichnodemus falicus Say Five testes of this species were studied Chromatin nucleoli were not determined in the rest stage of the spermnatogonia But they are very probably present there because two small rounded ones can be seen in the late spermatogonic prophases whether more than two I could not determine All the testes examined had been fixed with picroacetic acid causing such a swelling and consequent juxtaposition of the chromosomes that in only one case were they sufficiently separated to be counted P1 IV Fig 145 and here fourteen chromatin elements were present Since in the first maturation spindle there are always seven bivalent chromo somes I should think that the fourteen elements of Fig 145 are univalent chromosomes and that in this monaster the chromatin nucleoli are hidden In the monaster stage of the first maturation division are seen on pole views Figs 147 148 always seven larger elements which on lateral view are found to be all dumb bellshaped and so are probably bivalent All these seven elements are presumably chromosomes corresponding to the fourteen found in the spermatogonia Fig 145 Besides these are to be seen at this stage and also in the preceding prophases Fig 146 two or three smaller elements which are presumably chromatin nucleoli Generally three of these are found N 2 Figs 146 147 and generally the case is as in Fig 146 two larger and one smaller The two larger being generally of approximately equal volume Figs 146 148 it is quite probable that taken together they may represent one bivalent chromatin nucleolus with separated components The smaller one some times appears transversely constricted as in Fig 146 so this one may also be bivalent if this is the case then there should be four univalent ones in the spermatogonia But the number of them could not be determined in the spermatogonia and in the growth period of the spermatocytes the stain was not favorable for showing their relations 25 Peliopelta abbreviata Uhl Five testes of this species were studied In a pole view of the spermatogonic monaster PI IV Fig 149 the only clear case observed are found sixteen chromatin segments ten of which are larger and more elongate than the others while six are rounded and smaller The two smallest N 2 are probably chromatin nucleoli by analogy with other species of the Lygceidce 182OF THE GERM CELLS OF METAZOA In the growth period of the spermatocytes there is one clearly bivalent chromatin nucleolus which is frequently apposed to the larger true nucleolus In the monaster stage of the first maturation division Fig 150 pole view there are eight elements the smallest of which is the chromatin nucleolus N 2 on lateral view all these elements appear dumbbellshaped and hence are bivalent Fig 151 Of the seven chromosomes of this stage two are very small and five much larger the two small ones in Fig 151 being designated as a 2 and b 2 while in the figure only three of the large ones are shown Apparently the two small chromosomes of the spermatocyte cor respond to the four small chromosomes of the spermatogonium thus the bivalent chromosomes a 2 and b 2 of Fig 151 would correspond respectively to the univalent chromosomes a and b of Fig 149 and the five large bivalent chromosomes of the spermatocyte to the ten large univalent ones of the spermatogonium It is very evident that in the synapsis stage one of the small univalent chromosomes derived from the spermatogonium never unites with one of the large for the two univalent components of each small bivalent chromosome of the spermatocyte have approximately the same vol ume This speaks of course very strongly for the maintenance of the individuality of the chromosomes during these generations 26 Edancala dorsalis Say Four testes of this species were studied In the rest stage of the spermatogonium are present two chromatin nucleoli of rounded form N 2 Fig 152 P1 IV these are sometimes attached to one another sometimes to the true nucleolus N In the spermatogonic monaster there are thirteen chromatin elements present exactly this number being found in all of nine clear cases Two of these which are rounded and much smaller than the others are the chromiatin nucleoli N 2 Figs 153 154 the remaining eleven elements are relatively large elongated chromosomes All these elements are halved in the metakinesis In the synapsis stage the two chromatin nucleoli combine to form one bivalent one and even up to the rest stage of the spermatocyte Fig 155 it remains dumbbellshaped with a bridge of linin connecting its univalent components it is attached to the surface cf the true nucleolus N Fig 155 and the double nucleolus  so formed usually lies close to the nuclear membrane In the first maturation division there are seven chromatin elements Fig 156 pole view of monaster stage of which the smallest usually centrally placed one is the biva lent chromatin nucleolus N 2 Of the six chromosomes five when seen on lateral view are dumbbellshaped and so bivalent but the sixth is oval in outline without any A P SVOL XX X 183MONTGOMERYA STUDY OF THE CHROMOSOMES transverse constriction about the size of a univalent component of one of the bivalent chromosomes This is the chromosome marked x in Fig 157 in this figure is shown also the chromatin nucleolus N 2 but only two of the five bivalent chromosomes This sixth small chromosome is univalent and unipartite and evidently is the odd eleventh chromosome of the spermatogonium which had no fellow to combine with during the synapsis It is always recognizable on lateral views Fig 157 by its peculiar volume and form and even on pole views of the chromosomal plane is recognizable by its lesser depth Fig 156 x The first maturation division halves all seven elements Fig 158 anaphase being a transverse reducing division of the five bivalent chromosomes and of the chromatin nucleolus but in what plane the univalent chromosome x divides could not be deter mined on account of its nearly spherical form Apparently also in the second matura tion division all the six chromosomes become divided since in the spermatid six chroma tin elements can frequently be counted but I am not certain that the sixth chromosome does become divided in this mitosis The reduction in the number of chromosomes for this species is accordingly Spermatogonium two univalent chromatin nucleoli eleven univalent chromosomes first spermatocyte one bivalent chromatin nucleolus five bivalent chromosomes one univalent chromosome second spermatocyte one univalent chromatin nucleolus five univalent chromosomes one semivalent chromosome 27 Oncopeltus fasciatus Dall Eight testes of this species were studied The rest stage of the spermatogonium P1 IV Fig 159 shows usually one com paratively large elongate chromatin nucleolus N 2 which is generally peripheral in position this apparently represents two joined end to end for sometimes two separate ones can be seen In the spermatogonic monaster there are sixteen chromatin elements Fig 160 Fourteen are chromosomes and two are chromatin nucleoli as the relations in the sperma tocyte mitoses will demonstrate But it is difficult to determine which two are the chromatin nucleoli all sixteen elements being of approximately equal size though judging by analogy with the other species of the family they are probably the smallest two N 2 Fig 160 In the synapsis the fourteen chromosomes unite to form seven bivalent ones But there is never any very close union of the two chromatin nucleoli and in the rest stage of the spermatocytes the following conditions are found 1 the chromatin nucleoli apposed to one another and to the true nucleolus Fig 161 2 apposed to one 184OF THE GERM CELLS OF METAZOA another but separated from the nucleolus Fig 162 3 the chromatin nucleoli sepa rate from one another and only one in contact with the nucleolus Figs 163 165 4 the chromatin nucleoli separate from one another and from the nucleolus 5 the chromatin nucleoli separate from one another but both attached to the nucleolus Fig 164 These conditions do not appear to be stages in position but rather individual variations Whenever the two chromatin nucleoli are mutually apposed it is never an intimate appositioni e they never fuse to form one large rounded one such as is the general rule in the Pentatomidce Through the rest stage of the spermatocytes each chromatin nucleolus remains elongate they appear round only when seen from the end Sometimes each shows a trace of a transverse constriction and in one case Fig 165 one of them was separated into two parts Through the prophases of the first maturation mitosis the chromatin nucleoli remain separate from one another and each is elongate in form Fig 166 N 2 showing also all seven bivalent chromosomes on lateral view Pole views of the monaster stage of the first maturation division show in most cases nine chromatin elements Fig 167 the seven larger ones are chromosomes all bivalent and on lateral view dunbbellshaped Fig 166 the two smaller centrally placed ones are the two chromatin nucleoli N 2 Fig 167 In one case ten elements were seen on pole view Fig 168 this is very unusual but it may probably be explained by the assumption that there are here two chromatin nucleoli six bivalent chromosomes and two univalent chromosomes formed by the precocious separation of the parts of a biva lent chromosome A lateral view of the spindle is given Fig 169 showing the two chromatin nucleoli but only two of the seven bivalent chromosomes In the metaphase of this mitosis all seven chromosomes become transversely divided reduction division and each of the chromatin nucleoli becomes also divided in a plane perpendicular to its long axis compare Figs 169 and 170 in each of which only two of the seven chromosomes are shown A pole view of one cell of the dyaster stage follow ing Fig 171 shows the two daughter chromatin nucleoli N 2 and the seven daughter univalent chromosomes the apparent transverse constrictions on them representing tlle reappearance of the original longitudinal split compare the lefthand chromosome of Fig 170 The behavior of the chromatin nucleoli is thus different from that of the othler Hemiptera examined in the following regards 1 their large size in the spermatogonic monaster Fig 160 so that they can hardly be distinguished in volume from the chromosomes 2 the phenomenon that they remain more or less separate from one another during the growth period of the spermatocytes Figs 161165 and prophases of the first maturation division Fig 166 3 the fact that one or both may appear 185MONTGOMERYA STUDY OF THE CHROMOSOMES bipartite in the growth period Fig 165 and 4 the fact that they remain separate from one another in the first maturation division and that each divides transversely Figs 167 169 170 N 2 The last mentioned point deserves particular consideration for a transverse division of a chromatin element in the Ilemiptera always means a reduc tion divisioni e a separation of two whole univalent components of one already biva lent element From these facts we are led to the conclusion that here the chromatin nu cleoli are virtually bivalent in the spermatogonia and that since the spermatogonic division gives a longitudinal half of each of them to the spermatocytes that each is already bivalent in the spermatocytesa bivalence then produced before the synapsis stage of the growth period This conclusion would explain all their peculiarities listed above In the spermatogonium accordingly there would be virtually four chromnatin nucleoli twice the number found in the other species of the Lygceidcr with possibly the exception of the not fully explained Ichnodemus falicus CAPSIDlE 28 Leptopterna dolabrata Linn Three testes of this species were studied There were no spermatogonia on any preparations taken from adults in the last in star before copulation In the rest stage of the growth period of the spermatocytes are found the following relations for the chromatin nucleoli There are two chromatin nucleoli which 1 are attached to one another but separate from the true nucleolus Plate IV Fig 172 2 they are attached together and to the true nucleolus Fig 173 3 they are separated from one another but both attached to the true nucleolus Fig 175 often at opposite poles of the latter Fig 174 In almost all cases they are attached to the true nucleolus so that Fig 172 represents an unusual case Each chromatin nucleolus is probably a univa lent one for it never shows a bipartite appearance and is usually rounded so that in Figs 172 and 173 the two together would constitute one bivalent chromatin one but there cannot be certainty on this point until the number in the spermatogonia is determined Pole views of the monaster stage of the first maturation division Fig 176 show seventeen chromatin elements one of which centrally placed is always much larger than the others On lateral view all appear dumbbellshaped and so are probably biva lent Probably one of these elements represents the bivalent chromatin nucleolus de scribed for the growth period then the sixteen remaining would be chromosomes 186OF THE GERM CELLS OF METAZOA 29 Calocoris rapidus Say Three testes of this species were studied The number of chlromatin nucleoli in the rest stage of the spermatogonia was not determined In the most favorable pole view of a spermatogonic rnonaster were counted about thirty chromatin elements Plate IV Fig 177 but these elements were densely grouped so that I could not be positive as to the exact number Since there are in the sper matocytes fourteen bivalent chromosomes two bivalent chromatin nucleoli and one that is probably univalent there would be probably in the spermatogonia twentyeight univalent chromosomes and five univalent chromatin nucleoli a total of thirtythree elements In the telophase and rest stages of the spermatocytes there is a large true nucleolus which is remarkable in being flattened against the nuclear membrane N Figs 178 179 it appears sickleshaped on cross section and has irregularly lobular outlines on surface view In these stages there are five small chromatin nucleoli N 2 Fig 178 one of these is larger than the others and always spherical in form the larger one of Figs 178 and 179 and since it never appears bipartite is presumably univalent it is frequently attached to the true nucleolus The four other chromatin nucleoli are arranged in two pairs the two components of a pair being connected by a band of linin Figs 178 180 only one of the pairs shown in Fig 179 Each one of these four is very small and spherical and accordingly probably univalent and each pair would then be bivalent Thus there would appear to be in the spermatocytes one larger univalent chromatin nucleolus and two bivalent ones in each of the latter the univalent components being not closely apposed Pole views of the monaster stage of the first maturation division show always sixteen chromatin elements Figs 185 186 Three of these are always distinguishable by their much smaller size N 2 Figs 185 186 These three probably represent the three chromatin nucleoli of the preceding growth period two of them appear dumbbellshaped on lateral view Fig 181 and one of the two is shown in Fig 184 obviously representing the two bivalent ones of the growth period while the third one always appears rounded and never dtumbbellshaped Fig 181 the lowest of the elements designated N  and on lateral view of the spindle lies nearer one pole of the spindle than the other N 2 Fig 183 this one obviously representing the univalent chromatin nucleolus of the growth period Figs 181184 represent oblique lateral views of the spindles so that in each case only one spindle pole is shown such oblique views giving the best views of the chromatin elements The thirteen remaining larger elements of the first spermatocytes are chromo somes and lateral views show that twelve of these are dumbbellshaped and hence prob ably bivalent but the thirteenth is quadrivalent composed of two bivalent dumbbell 187MONTGOMERYA STUDY OF THE CHROMOSOMES shaped placed side by side with their long axes parallel This quadrivalent chromosome shows its nature plainly on lateral view t Figs 182 183 on pole view it may always be told by its greater volume t Figs 185 186 sometimes even on pole view it appears slightly constricted Fig 186 t the constriction then denoting the plane of appo sition of the two bivalent chromosomes of which it is composed it is placed in the spindle so that the tranverse constriction of each of its component chromosomes lies in the plane of the equator Figs 182 183 There are accordingly in the first spermatocyte two bivalent chromatin nucleoli one univalent chromatin nucleolus twelve bivalent chromosomes and one quadrivalent chromosome in all sixteen chromatin elements In the spindle of the second spermatocyte are found either fifteen chromatin elements Fig 188 or sixteen Fig 187 This disparity in number is produced by the unival ent chromatin nucleolus not dividing in the first maturation mitosis but passing undivided into one of the two daughter cells second spermatocytes for it will be remembered that in the monaster stage of the first mitosis it always lies a little outside of the plane of the equator nearer one pole of the spindle than the other Fig 183 N 2 The rest of the chromatin elements of the second spermatocyte are univalent halves of those in the first spermatocyte the first maturation division is a reluction division namely halves of the two bivalent chromatin nucleoli of the twelve bivalent chromosomes and of the one quadrivalent chromosome The latter element can be recognized in the second spermato cytes by its greater size t Figs 187 188 and it here consists of two univalent chromo somes placed in apposition in the spindle of the first maturation mitosis Figs 182 183 it was so placed that each of its bivalent chromosomes underwent a transverse reduction division just as was the case with the other bivalent chromosomes 30 Pcecilocapsus lineatus Fabr Six testes of this species were studied There were no spermatogonic mitoses on my preparations and I could not determine the relations of the chromatin nucleoli in the rest stage of the spermatogonia In the rest stage of the spermatocytes are found two chromatin nucleoli N 2 Fig 189 P1 IV in one testis two additional very minute chromatin nucleoli seemed to be present but I could not find them on the other preparations One of the chromatin nucleoli is very large and clearly bilobed Fig 189 so that it would seem to be bivalent the other is considerably smaller and apparently always rounded so that it may be uni valent These two chromatin nucleoli are sometimes but not usually in mutual contact Pole views e mne e of the monaster stage of the first maturation mitosis show always eighteen chromatin elements Fig 190 One of these is much smaller and one much larger than 188OF THE GERM CELLS OF METAZOA the others Probably two of the eighteen elements correspond to the two chromatin nucleoli of the growth period but I cannot determine which two they are if this is so then there would be here sixteen chromosomes all apparently bivalent judging from their dumbbellshape on lateral view and one bivalent and one univalent chromatin nucleolus But there can be no surety in regard to these valences without a knowledge of the num bers in the spermatogonia 31 Pecilocapsus goniphorus Say Four testes of this species were studied There were no spermatogonic mitoses on my preparations all from adult individuals In the rest stage of the spermatocytes there are present four bipartite chromatin nucleoli N 2 Figs 192195 P1 V in one single case there were five Fig 191 The largest of the four is composed generally of two rods placed side by side this is shown in lateral view in Figs 191 194 in end view in Figs 192 193 195 the lateral view of this one the lower of the large ones of Fig 191 sometimes shows that each of its com ponent rods may be transversely constricted which might imply that each of the rods is bivalent and hence that the whole is quadrivalent In each of the three small bipartite chromatin nucleoli the univalent components may be closely apposed to one an other Figs 191 192 or may be more or less widely separated Figs 193195 Of the four chromatin nucleoli the largest and the smallest are generally attached to opposite poles of the true nucleolus N 2 Figs 191194 though the relative positions vary con siderably as shown by the figures and it is the two which are generally not so attached which have their component parts most widely separated Thus there are at least four possibly five bivalent chromatin nucleoli in the sperma tocytes Pole views of the monaster stage of the first maturation mitosis show either seventeen chromatin elements of approximately equal volume Fig 197 and this was the rule in two of the testes examined while in a third testis in the majority of cases there was present a smaller element in addition to the seventeen larger ones t Fig 196 possibly this small element may always be present but frequently escape observation by being closely apposed to one of the larger elements All these elements appear dumbbellshaped on lateral view Fig 198 and so are probably bivalent How may of these eighteen elements are chromosomes and how many are chromatin nucleoli I cannot determine since the number in the spermatogonia was not ascertained Possibly the small element t of Fig 196 may represent the largest chromatin nucleolus of the preceding growth period and the seventeen remaining be chromosomes or if all four chromatin nucleoli are represented in the first maturation division then there would remain fourteen chromosomes 189MONTGOMERYA STUDY OF THE CHROMOSOMES PHYMATID2E 32 Phymata sp P wlffii Stal Nine testes of this species were studied In the rest stage of the spermatogonium there are two chromatin nucleoli N 2 Fig 199 P1 V usually unequal in size frequently one or both of them is in contact with the true nucleolus N In the spermatogonic monaster are seen on pole view Fig 200 thirty chromatin elements two of these certainly represent the chromatin nucleoli but they offer no pecu liarities by which they can be distinguished from the twentyeight small chromosomes In the synapsis stage the twentyeight chromosomes unite to form fourteen bivalent ones and the two chromatin nucleoli to form one bivalent one The latter is in the telo phase and rest stage of the spermatocyte Fig 201 clearly transversely constricted show ing its bipartite nature and is always apposed to the surface of the larger true nucleolus Fig 201 N Pole views of the monaster stage of the first maturation division Fig 202 always show exactly fifteen chromatin elements namely fourteen chromosomes and one chroma tin nucleolus All these elements are found to be dumbbellshaped on lateral view Fig 203 showing eight of them so that all are bivalent The chromatin nucleolus cannot be distinguished in size from the chromosomes NABIDLE 33 Coriscus ferus Linn Three testes of this species were studied The relations of the chromatin nucleoli were not determined in the small nuclei of the spermatogonia and the spermatogonic mitoses were not favorable for counting the small rounded chromosomes In the growth period of the spermatocytes there is usually one large bivalent chromatin nucleolus with its component parts in close apposition N 2 Fig 205 P1 V attached to the true nucleolus N Sometimes its component parts which are of equal volume are separated from one another and then both may be attached to the same true nucleolus Fig 204 or they may be apposed to separate nucleoli or only one of them may be apposed to a nucleolus of which there are generally two sometimes three Be sides the large bivalent chromatin nucleolus can be seen in most nuclei a much smaller chromatin nucleolus Fig 205 which stains like the larger one it is generally close to the nuclear membrane but is occasionally apposed to a true nucleolus In the first maturation division there are ten chromatin elements Fig 206 in which 190OF THE GERM CELLS OF METAZOA five are seen on lateral view and five on pole view all these elements not having taken their definite position in the equator of the spindle All are bivalent as is proved by their bipartite appearance on lateral view One of them is smaller than the others and may represent the large bivalent chromatin nucleolus of the growth period N 2 Fig 206 while the nine remaining elements are probably chromosomes if this interpretation be correct then the small univalent  chromatin nucleolus found in the growth period would not be represented in the first maturation division REDUVIIDAE 34 Acholla multispinosa De G Eight testes of this species were studied The relations of the minute chroinatin nucleoli could not be determined in the rest stage of the spermatogonia In the most favorable pole view of a spermatogonic monaster P1 V Fig 207 could be counted thirtyone chromatin elements The twentyfour larger elements seen here are univalent chromosomes the seven smallest are chromatin nucleoli sonme of them very minute Of the latter there are six arranged in three pairs and one that is isolated Now we shall find that in the spermatocytes there are four bivalent chromatin nucleoli Figs 208211 so that in the spermatogonia there should be eight and accordingly though only seven are to be seen in Fig 207 we are justified in concluding that an eighth must be present there but hidden from view by one of the chromosomes Thus there would be in the spermatogonium in all probability twentyfour chromosomes and eight chromatin nucleoli in all thirtytwo elements In the synapsis stage of the growth period the twentyfour chromosomes unite to form twelve bivalent ones The eight chromatin nucleoli likewise combine to form four bivalent ones which near the close of the growth period Figs 208 209 are seen to be small bodies attached to the surface of the true nucleolus N Each is dumbbellshaped usually with its component univalent parts in close apposition but occasionally the latter are more or less separated from one another Pole views of the moinaster stage of the first maturation division Fig 210 show six teen elements namely twelve larger bivalent chromosomes dumbbellshaped on lateral view and four much smaller chromatin nucleoli N 2 All these elements are halved in the following metakinesis which is a transverse reduction division and pole views of the daughter cells second spermatocytes Fig 211 show twelve larger univalent chromo somes and four smaller univalent chromatin nucleoli N 2 A P SVOL xx Y 191MONTGOMERYA STUDY OF THE CHROMOSOMES 35 Sinea diadema Fabr Two testes of this species were studied The relations of the chromatin nucleoli in the rest stage of the spermatogonia could not be determined There were on my preparations only a few spermatogonic monaster stages and none of these were favorable for determining the number of chromosomes the chromosomes are small densely grouped and particularly minute elements among them might be chromatin nucleoli In the rest stage of the spermatocyte are present four small chromatin nucleoli N 2 Figs 212 213 PI V all of them attached to the surface of a large true nucleolus N One is larger than the others and appearing on lateral view to be always transversely con stricted Fig 213 is probably bivalent and as one of the three smaller ones is some times found to be bipartite this too would be bivalent The two remaining are appar ently always spherical and not transversely constricted so that they would seem to be univalent If this interpretation is correct there would be here two bivalent chromatin nucleoli each with its component parts closely apposed and one bivalent one with its components separated that is three bivalent ones in all and in the first maturation divi sion there are three chromatin nucleoli present Figs 214 215 which would corroborate this conclusion But since it could not be determined how many there are in the sperma togonia the relations in the spermatocytes cannot be considered positively demonstrated Pole views of the monaster stage of the first maturation division Figs 214 215 show always three minute chromatin elements which are chromatin nucleoli N 2 and apparently thirteen larger chromosomes But a careful examination of these larger elements shows that in every case four bivalent chromosomes form together a plurivalent one all four being closely apposed and with their long axes parallel to one another This is best seen on lateral view of the spindle Figs 217 218 where the four chromo somes marked t are always found to be grouped close together in Fig 216 only these four chromosomes with their mantle fibre attachments are seen on lateral view Of the four chromosomes thlus grouped together the two middle ones stand in the closest apposi tion Fig 216218 and on pole views these two middle ones may be so closely apposed as to appear as one long one t Fig 214 or a slighttransverse constriction marks the division line between them t Fig 215 It follows accordingly that the three elements seen on pole view and marked t are really four bivalent chromosomes the two central ones being so closely apposed as to appear generally as one long one A comparison of the elements designated t in Figs 214 and 215 with the corresponding elements in Figs 216 218 makes this evident Accordingly there are really fourteen bivalent dumbbellshaped 192OF THE GERM CELLS OF METAZOA chromosomes present four of which are always grouped together to form a particular group The metakinesis halves each of the fourteen bivalent chromosomes transversely reduction division Figs 217 218 but the four which together form the group that has been described divide later than the others as can be seen from the figures given and it is at this metaphase that this group of four can be most easily recognized Such a group of four closely united bivalent chromosomes has not been found by me in any other Hemipteron 36 Prionidus cristatus Linn Four testes of this species were studied In the rest stage of the spermatogonium there are apparently five chromatin nucleoli N 2 Figs 220222 PI V two of which are generally considerably larger than the others and some or all of which may be attached to the true nucleolus N Figs 221 222 But it is difficult to be sure of the exact number for sometimes not more tha four can be seen Fig 221 In the spermatogonic monaster on pole views Figs 223 224 are seen twentysix chromatin elements three of which N 2 are always much smaller and by analogy with the other species of the Reduviidce would probably represent the three small chromatin nucleoli of the preceding rest stage Two of the twentysix chromatin ele ments are elongate in form and much larger than the others these may be chromosomes which would be more probable or they might represent the large chromatin nucleoli of the rest stage of the spermatogonium If there are really five chromatin nucleoli in the spermatogonia then there would be these five elements and twentyone chromosomes present in the spermatogonic mitosis In five pole views I could count exactly twenty six chromatin elements in two there were either twentysix or twentyseven and in one either twentyfour or twentyfive but in all these cases three particularly small and two particularly large elements could be distinguished In the rest stage of the spermatocyte Fig 225 are found four chromatin nucleoli N 2 attached to the true nucleolus N One of these is longer than the others and rodshaped and may represent the two larger chromatin nucleoli of the spermatogonium joined into one bivalent one the three smaller ones may appear rounded or slightly elongate and these may represent the three small chromatin nucleoli of the spermato gonium occasionally two of the small ones are apposed together There were no maturation mitoses on my preparations from adults taken in the month of September 193MONTQOMERYA STUDY OF THE CHROMOSOMES 37 lMilyas cinctus Fabr In the single testis of this species studied an individual of the month of September there were no mitoses In the rest stage of the spermatocytes Figs 226228 are found one long rod shaped chromatin nucleolus and two or three smaller ones N 2 all apposed to the true nucleolus N The long one is certainly bivalent since it frequently shows a transverse constriction Fig 228 or is bent at the middle point Fig 227 on account of the length of each of its component parts it might be concluded that each of them is biva lenti e that the whole element is quadrivalentbut neither of the parts appear bipar tite so that this long chromatin nucleolus would more probably be bivalent In those cases where only two smaller chromatin nucleoli are present Fig 228 each of them is clearly transversely constricted bipartite and hence bivalent where three are present we find that one is bipartite and accordingly bivalent Fig 227 the other two are spherical and hence univalent By comparing Figs 227 and 228 we find that the two spherical chromatin nucleoli of the former would together represent one of the small bivalent chromatin nucleoli of the latter Thus we may conclude that there are three bivalent chromatin nucleoli present in these spermatocytes though the two components of one of them may be separated LIMNOBATIDE 38 Limnobates lineata Say Of this small species I was able to procure the testes of only one adult individual The only stages of spermatogenesis present were spermatocytes in the growth period In the large spermatocytes in the rest stage PI V Fig 219 is found a large chromatin nucleolus N 2 usually apposed to the true nucleolus N in such a manner that the chromatin nucleolus touches with one pole the nuclear membrane with the other the true nucleolus HYDROBATIDE 39 Hygotrechus sp Twelve testes were studied of this species from the vicinity of Philadelphia The relations of the chromatin nucleoli in the rest stage of the spermatogonia could not be determined since the nuclei are very small at this stage The speriatogonic mlonaster shows on pole view P V Fig 229 exactly twenty chromatin elements of which the eighteen largest are chromosomes and the two smallest N 2 probably chromatin nucleoli In the synapsis stage of the spermatocyte Fig 230 are seen two small chromatin 194OF THE GERM CELLS OF METAZOA nucleoli N 2 which are not closely apposed the true nucleolus N is much larger In the rest stage the chromatin nucleoli are usually widely separated from one another and on account of their small size are difficult to discovei In the growth period they do not stain bright red with the saffraninegentian violet stain of Hermann but deep violet even on excellently stained preparations Such a staining reaction as this I have not found for the chromatin nucleoli of other Hemiptera for in all the other forms examined the chromatin nucleoli take the red saffranine stain intensely even while the chromosomes have taken the violet stain in the rest stage Perhaps in Hygotrechus the chromatin nucleoli differ chemically less from the chromosomes than in the other Hemiptera and undergo in the growth period changes parallel to those of the chromo sonies Pole views of the monaster stage of the first maturation division Fig 231 show always exactly eleven chromatin elements On account of the number in the spermato gonia twenty I would interpret these as nine bivalent chromosomes and two univalent chromatin nucleoli which are not combined into one bivalent one This is very probable since the two univalent chromatin nucleoli are often widely separated in the growth period and on lateral views of the monaster stage of the first maturation division there are found two bodies which are spherical and not dumbbellshaped On no lateral view of this monaster stage could I see all the nine chromosomes clearly but in one case I saw eight of them all clearly dumbbellshaped bipartite so that probably all nine are bivalent The first maturation division is reductional as in the other Hemiptera 40 Liminotrechus marginatus Say Two testes of this species were studied There were no spermatogonic monaster stages present and I could not determine the relations of the chromatin nucleoli in the rest stage of these cells In the rest stage of the spermatocyte P1 V Fig 232 is found a large true nucleo lus N and separated from it usually close to the nuclear membrane a rounded chromatin nucleolus N 2 Pole views of the first maturation monaster Fig 233 show eleven chromatin ele ments sometimes one appears much smaller than the others and it may represent the chromatin nucleolus NAUCORIDL 41 Pelocoris femorata Pal Beauv Fourteen testes of this species were studied from adult and halfgrown individuals of different seasons of the year There were an abundance of rest stages of spermato gonia and of spermatocytes in the growth period but no maturation mitoses present 195MONTGOMERYA STUDY OF THE CHROMOSOMES The chromosomes were counted in a number of pole views of the monaster stage of the spermatogonia but in most cases they were so densely grouped as to make the numbers obtained very uncertain In the most favorable case P1 V Fig 234 appa rently twenty chromatin elements are present but I could not be certain of this number The relations of the chromatin nucleoli in the growth period are very puzzling On preparations stained with Hermanns saffraninegentian violet there appear to be a variable number of rounded bodies of different volume which stain bright red some times they are arranged in pairs sometimes in long chains sometimes they show no regular arrangement whatsoever One nuclear body much larger than the others and generally irregular in outline may be a true nucleolus If all the redstaining bodies are chromatin nucleoli they would seem to be present in an unusually large number in this species A study of further material will be necessary to explain the nature and relations of these bodies BELOSTOMATIDE 42 Zaitha sp There are two species of this genus known in the vicinity of Philadelphia where I collected my material namely Z fluminea Say and Z aurantiacum Leidy but which species it was that I collected I omitted at the time to determine Ten testes were examined In the rest stage of the spermatogonium Fig 235 are present two small chromatin nucleoli N 2 apposed to a large true nucleolus N Pole views of the spermatogonic monaster stage Figs 236 237 show twentyfour chromatin elements of which the smallest two N 2 represent the chromatin nucleoli and the remaining twentytwo are chromosomes Of the chromosomes four are always elongate and much larger than the others t Figs 236 237 In the synapsis stage of the growth period the twentytwo chromosomes unite to form eleven bivalent ones In the rest stage of the spermatocytes there are two univa lent chromatin nucleoli sometimes joined to make a bivalent one attached to the surface of the true nucleolus Pole views of the moiiaster stage of the first maturation division Fig 238 show  In my  Note on the Genital Organs of Zaitha  American Naturalist Vol xxxiv 1900 I described the structure of these testes To the text figure B given in that paper I would add now that the earlier stages of spermatogenesis are to be found in what I called the terminal fibres  at the proximal end of the testis these fibres being five long and much convoluted slender tubes which interlace together and form a rounded whitish mass at the extreme proximal end of the testis they were not correctly represented in the figure cited In adult individuals it is only in this portion of the testis that the earlier spermatogenetic stages occur all the rest of the testis being filled with spermatozoa It is necessary to collect individuals in the month of May shortly before the copulation in order to obtain the stages of the maturation divisions 196OF THE GERM CELLS OF METAZOA always thirteen chromatin elements Two of these are much smaller than the others N 2 and are obviously the univalent chromatin nucleoli which at this stage do not make up a bivalent one The eleven large elements are chromosomes and since all of them appear dumbbellshaped on lateral view they are all bivalent Two of the eleven chromosomes have a markedly greater volume than the others t 2 Fig 238 and these correspond to the four large chromosomes of the spermatogonia t Figs 236 237 that is to say in the synapsis the four large chromosomes derived from the spermatogo nia unite together to form two bivalent ones and a large one never appears to unite with a small one The first maturation mitosis is a reduction division and each daughter cell second spermatocyte receives eleven whole univalent chromosomes III GENERAL CONCLUSIONS T The process of spermatogenesis in the Hemiptera and the individuality of the chromosomes In the enemiptera heteroptera we find as generally elsewhere in the Metazoa a number of generations of spermatogonia in each of which all the chromatin elements are halved in metakinesis apparently in all cases equationally the last generation pro ducing spermatocytes of the first order These spermatocytes enter upon a growth period of long duration which is followed by the first maturation division resulting in the formation of spermatocytes of the second order and in the second maturation division the spermatocytes of the second order are divided into spermatids There are always exactly two maturation divisions and no more The metamorphosis of the spermatids into the spermatozoa has not been studied by me and has not the broad com parative interest of the preceding stages but it has been described by Henking 1890 and Paulmier 1899 The growth period of the spermatocytes is of the greatest interest for here are a remarkable series of changes not found in any other generation of the germ cells nor so far as is known in any somatic cells And the most important of these changes are found in the synapsis stage of the growth period The synapsis stage is wellmarked in all the Hemiptera examined by me without exception characterized by a dense grouping of the chromatin loops the citations given by me in my study on Peripatus 1901 show that it seems to be present in almost all if not all the Metazoa in which the spermatogenesis and ovogenesis has been carefully examined The dense grouping of the chromosomes in this stage is not an artifact produced by faulty fixation methods as McClung 1900 has recently maintained for exactly the same appearances are to be 197MONTGOMERYA STUDY OF THE CHROMOSOMES found after the action of most diverse fixatives The dense and interlacing grouping of the chromosomes that is so characteristic for the synapsis of Insects Copepods Ascaris and some other forms is however not found in all thus it does not appear to occur in Salamandra Meves 1896 Moore 1895 first gave the name synaptic phase to that stage in the growth period of Elasmobranchs when the reduction in the number of the chromosomes takes place Accordingly the criterion of the synapsis stage is first of all the combination of univalent chromosomes to form bivalent ones whether thle chromosomes are then densely grouped or not is of secondary importance A special chapter of the present paper is given to the broader significance of this stage In all the Hemiptera examined and also in Peripatus I have found that bivalent chromosomes are formed in the synapsis by a union end to end of every two univalent chromosomes All other writers on this stage with the exception of Brauer have been unable to determine how the univalent chromosomes become united together Brauers 1893 b careful study of the growth period in the spermatogenesis of Ascaris rendered it very probable that it is a union end to end but his figures do not prove it absolutely Certain writers state that the reduction of the number in chromosomes is effected by the chromatin spirem segmenting into only half the normal number of chromosomes This is however an incorrect statement inasmuch as the reduction in number is occasioned in some cases Hemiptera Peripatus before the spirem stage of the first maturation division and inasmuch as in most cases if not all there is no continuous chromatin spirem found at any time during the growth period and prophases of the first maturation mitosis Accordingly in the Hemiptera the reduction in number of the chromosomes is effected in the synapsis stage a long while before the maturation divisions by a union end to end of every two chromosomes During the synapsis stage the chromosomes become split longitudinally as was first shown by Paulmier 1898 1899 for Anasa a process that I had overlooked in my former paper 1898 Each bivalent chromosome is thus both transversely and longitudinally split before the inaturation mitoses the transverse split represented by the band of linin joining the approximated ends of the two univalent chromosomes At the close of the growth period there is a welldefined rest stage in most Hentiptera when chromosomal boundaries are practically indistinguishable but in the Coreidce and Redu viidcw there appears to be no such stage and accordingly such a stage would appear to have no broad significance In the early prophases of the maturation divisions the chromosomes are bivalent but quadripartite each one being transversely and longitudinally split in the later pro 198OF THE GERM CELLS OF METAZOA phases up to the monaster stage of the first mitosis the longitudinal split generally closes temporarily The definitive form of these chromosomes in all the Hemiptera examined is that of a dumbbell which may be either straight or bent ring forms are more infre quent but are occasionally found in all species In the Hemiptera as in Peripatus each ring may be conceived as a dumbbell whichl has become bent until its ends meet and accordingly the hollow of the ring is not the longitudinal split but a space sepa rating the univalent chromosomes That is to say generally only one end of one univalent chromosome is joined to one end of the other but in the ring form both ends of the one are joined with both ends of the other In all bivalent chromosomes that have not the ring form a longitudinal axis can be plainly determined and generally each univalent chromosome is elongated in the same line the constriction perpendicular to this long axis is a true transverse division and is the band of linin joining the ends of the two univalent chromosomes This orientation of the axes of the bivalent chromo somes allows the positive determination of the manner in which the chromosomes are halved in the maturation divisions In the first maturation division in all the Hemniptera examined the bivalent chromo somes are transversely divided i e whole univalent chromosomes are separated in the anaphase of this division the longitudinal split of the univalent chromosomes reappears and in the second maturation mitosis the univalent chromosomes are halved through the plane of this split equation division The valences of the chromosomes in the successive generations are accordingly spermatogonium univalent first spermatocyte bivalent second spermatocyte univalent spermatid semivalent The classing of the chromosomes as semivalent in the spermatid may appear surprising for they have always been consid ered univalent but they must be considered semivalent with reference to the number in the spermatogonia in those cases as in all the Hemniptera examined where the second maturation division follows immediately upon the first without any indication of an inter mediate rest stage Thus in the Hemiptera as in Peripatus the maturation divisions do not accomplish the reduction in number of the chromosomes for this takes place long before in the growth period the first maturation division separates entire univalent chromosomes pseudoreduction Riickert 1894 the second halves each univalent chromosome equation ally and thus halves the chromatin mass Though the chromosomes of the spermatid are logically semivalent with reference to those in the spermatogonia yet they are potentially univalent on account of the increase in mass of the chromatin during the growth period where at least a doubling of the mass occurs In my study on Peripatus 1901 it was shown that the individuality of the chromo somes is maintained from the last spermatogonic mitosis up to and through the maturation A P SVOL XX Z 199MONTGOMERYA STUDY OF THE CHROMOSOMES divisions and in that paper I have referred to the observations of other workers cor roborative of the individuality of the chromosomes so that they need not be recalled here In such Hemiptera as the Coreidce there is no true rest stage in the growth period so that definite chromosomal outlines can be determined throughout the growth period And even in those Hemiptera where a rest stage does occur in this period in which the chromosomes become reticular and practically indistinguishable from one another all evidence renders it probable that the chromosomnal individuality is retained through this periodi e that a particular univalent chromosome of the maturation mitosis represents a particular one of the spermatogonia This evidence is as follows The chromatin nucleoli which are only modified chromosomes retain their compact form and so are readily distinguishable throughout all periods of these generations Then in those cases where there is an uneven nunmber of chromosomes in the spermatogonia and the odd one remains univalent in the spermatocytes this odd one can always be distinguished in the maturation mitoses Then where two of the spermatogonic chromosomes are particularly large there is always found in the first maturation mitosis one particularly large bivalent chromosome which can only correspond to those two Further after a rest stage there is always the same number of chromosomes as were present before that rest stage All this evidence speaks for a chromosome of a spermatogonium corresponding to a chromosome of a spermatocyte and if in these generations there is a maintenance of chromosomal individuality there is a probability that there is such a maintenance through all generations of the germinal cycle But this conclusion by no means implies that a chromosome of one generation is actually the same as a chromosome of another For we know that each chromosome is halved in an equation division and that each daughter chromosome so produced must increase to a volume equal to that of the mother chromo some before it enters upon a second mitosis Thus new substance must continually be elaborated by the chromosomes during the rest stages and in the course of this elaboration the old substance of the chromnosomne and its physical form are correspond ingly changed There is no evidence that chromosomal substance remains unchanged from generation to generation for all evidence shows that it undergoes metabolic change and growth in the rest stages But nevertheless it seems very probable that a chromo some of one generation is a derivative of a particular chromosome of the preceding genera tion and that the chromosomes may thus be said to maintain themselves as entities through successive generations There are many cases where chromosomal boundaries are indistinguishable in the rest stages so that in such cases it has been argued that the chromosomes show no indi viduality But these are negative examples and positive cases that speak for the main tenance of the chromosomal individuality must be considered as the decisive ones No 200OF THE GERM CELLS OF METAZOA other assumption can so well explain the maintenance of a constant number The fact that the chromosomes build up new substance at one stage and give off waste products at another does not invalidate our conclusion Those who deny the maintenance of chromosomal individuality on the basis of a study of objects where the chromosomes do not appear to be continuous from generation to generation are not justified in conclud ing that there is never a maintenance of the individuality until they have examined the positive cases And since there have been shown to be positive cases we must conclude 1 either that in all normal mitoses of the germinal cycle the chromosomal individuality is maintained or 2 that it is preserved in some cases but not in others The fact that it has been demonstrated for some cases renders it probable that is maintained in all cases even though it cannot be demonstrated in all 2 The chromatin nucleoli The term chromatin nucleolus was applied by me 1898 to the remarkable chromatin element in form like a nucleolus but in behavior and staining reactions like a chromosome in the nuclei of spermatocytes of Euchistus Pentatomna the name was given in order to denote this double similarity though I fully realized that this structure was in all essentials a modified chromosome A special monograph 1899 b was devoted by me to the true nucleolus plasmosome Ogata of Metazoan cells and in a lecture at the Woods Holl laboratory 1898b I classified the other nucleolar structures as  karyosomes which are merely thickened nodal points of the chromatin reticulum further what I shall term the chromatinnucleus typographical error for chromatin nucleolus which is found in certain spermatocytes and then various structures which stain neither like the true nucleolus nor the chromatin and to which such terms as Paramcleoli Nebennucleoli and Pseudonucleoli have been applied It is one of the most difficult questions to determine the nature and correspondence of the latter structures  But from the cases studied by me it would appear that some of these structures in Metazoa probably must be placed within the category of true nucleoli and be regarded as true nucleoli of a different chemical nature    our criterion of nucleoli probably should not be based as much upon chemical as morpho logical facts The chromatin nucleolus is a modified chromosome as both my earlier and the present observations show The term may have been injudiciously chosen since I myself showed that it has nothing in common with a true nucleolus except sometimes in the form and in containing vacuoles In its stead McClung 1899 has given the name accessory chromosome and Paulmier 1899 the name small chromosome But McCluns term is not satisfactory in not being at all definite and Paulmiers term is not 201MONTGOMERYA STUDY OF THE CHROMOSOMES applicable to those cases where it is as large as the other chr6mosomes Hence I con sider that confusion in terminology would be best avoided by retaining my original term  chromatin nucleolus In my first description of the spermatogenesis of Euchistus 1898 a I stated that I could not find chromatin nucleoli in spermatogonia and that one appeared for the first time in the spermatocyte by a metamorphosis of one of the fourteen chromosomes this was an error that I have corrected in the present paper for in Euchistus just as Paulmier 1899 correctly described for Anasa there are two chromatin nucleoli in the spermatogonium and these unite in the spermatocyte to form one bivalent one And in all the Hemiptera examined by me the larger chromatin nucleoli of the spermatocytes are derivatives of chromatin nucleoli of the spermatogonia except the remarkable  chromosome x of Protenor to which we shall return As far as I have been able to determine the chromatin nucleoli are always halved in the mitoses of the spermatogonia a General Characteristics The chromatin nucleoli are morphologically chromosomes undergoing division in mitosis like the other chromosomes but differing from them in the rest stage by preserv ing a definite usually rounded form There is also another difference which is of great use in their study by the use of the double stain of Hermann saffranine and gentian violet the chromosomes proper stain red only in mitosis and violet in tlle rest stage while the chromatin nucloli stain red in the rest stage also and so can be sharply dis tinguished from the chromatin of the chromosomes Thus the chlromatin nucleoli of the Hemiptera seem to retain at all stages the stain characteristic for the substance of the chromosomes when in the height of mitosis In the Hemiptera examined the true nucleoli never takes this red stain but take the violet so that they may in this way be easily distinguished from the chromatin nucleolif With ironhaematoxylin staining the chromatin nucleoli stain more intensely than the chromosomes in the rest stage but with this stain the true nucleoli generally stain deep black like the chromatin nucleoli so that it is far less satisfactory than the preceding method for differentiating these two structures With the triple stain of EhrlichBiondiHeidenhain the chromatin nucleoli  The only exception to this staining reaction was found in the spermatocytes ot Hygotrechus where in the rest stage the chromatin nucleoli always take the violet stain t However in cells of many other Metazoa I have found that the true nucleoli show a particular electivity for the saffranine so that chemical reactions are not tests for true nucleoli nucleoli may differ chemically from one another even in the same cell at the same stage or at different stages and no better case of this may be mentioned than the ovocytes of the growth period of Gryllus In the Hemiptera the true nucleoli are generally much larger than the chromatin nucleoli more or less irregular in outline and they usually occupy a more or less central position in the nucleus though I have mentioned two or three exceptions while the chromatin nucleoli in the spermato cytes are generally in contact with the nuclear membrane 202OF THE GERM CELLS OF METAZOA and chromosomes in the rest stage are green the true nucleoli red with Delafields htematoxylin and eosin the chromatin nucleoli and chromosomes stain blue the true nucleolus red with both these methods the chromatin nucleoli stain more intensely than the chromosomes in the rest stage In the spermatogonia the chromatin nucleoli are generally small often very minute and difficult to distinguish They are apparently always halved in the spermatogonic mitoses though I have not been able to determine this for all species They always increase in volume during the growth period of the spermatocytes  the relative amount of this increase varies in different species but it is a number of times greater than in the spermatogonia During this increase in mass there can be found in most cases a clear vacuole in the chromatin nucleolus so that the increase would appear to be not so much one of the proper substance of the chromatin nucleolus as of an intussusception of fluid from without I have not figured these vacuoles in the present paper but showed them in a preceding one 1898a In the prophases of the first maturation division the chromatin nucleolus decreases very considerably in volume until when the monaster stage is reached its volume may be very little greater than in the spermatogonia It is possible that its increase in mass during the growth period may be due in part to a decon densation of its substance but in some part at least it is due to the abovedescribed taking in of fluid substance from without In the spermatogonia they are irregular in position sometimes close together some times separated but usually not in contact with the nuclear membrane in these cells they are very frequently in all species apposed to the true nucleoli In the growth period of the spermatocytes they are more regular in position thus they are separated from the true nucleoli and then always in contact with the nuclear membrane in Euchistus Mormidia Peribalus Cosmopepla Nezara Brochymena Trichopepla Eury gaster Metapodius Anasa Chariesterus generally Corizus Harm ostes Calocoris Hygo trechus Limnotrechus they are as a rule apposed to the true nucleoli in Podisus Perillus Cownus Alydus Protenor Peliopelta not always Edancala Oncopeltus not always Leptopterna Pwcilocapsus Phymata Coriscus the Reduviidc Lirnobates and Zaitha We shall refer again to the significance of this apposition A chromatin nucleolus and a true nucleolus closely attached together constitute a  double nucleolus  it remains to be shown whether the  double nucleoli  of certain cells of other Metazoa as e g in the cells of Sertoli of Salamandra and lfus as described by Hermann and others may also be cases of apposed chromatin nucleoli and true nucleoli It is very characteristic of the chromatin nucleoli of the spermatocytes in the growth period to be closely apposed to the nuclear membrane And when they are apposed to true nucleoli  In the spermatogonia there are in all species an irregular number of true nucleoli but in the spermatocytes of most of the species examined there is regularly one large one 203MONTGOMERYA STUDY OF THE CHROMOSOMES they retain this position if they are of comparatively large size as in most Pentatomidce but do not when they are of comparatively small size as particularly in the Reduviidw Now the true nucleolus is rarely in contact with the nuclear membrane when it is not apposed to a chromatin nucleolus so that when the two are mutually apposed it appears to depend upon their relative volumes whether they will be peripheral or central in positiona very large chromatin nucleolus pulling to the periphery the true nucleolus a small chromatin nucleolus being pulled by the true nucleolus toward the centre of the nucleus That the chromatin nucleoli are morphologically chromosomes is shown particularly in mitosis when they simulate in form and divide like chromosomes an examination of the chromatin nucleoli designated N 2 in the plates of the present paper demonstrate this point The univalent chromatin nucleoli of the spermatogonia generally unite to form bivalent ones in the synapsis stage just as do the chromosomes and generally the number of them in the spermatocytes is just half of that in the spermatogonia certain exceptions shall be considered later In the first maturation division each bivalent chromatin nucleolus is halved transversely reduction division just as are the bivalent chromosomes Thus the chromatin nucleoli are essentially chromosomes but chromosomes which preserve a compact form and dense structure throughout the rest period b Number and Valence It is most frequently the case that there are two univalent chromatin nucleoli in the spermatogonia as in the Pentatomidce Eurygaster Coreidce Peliopelta Edancala Phy mata Coriscus  Hygotrechus Zaitha In these cases the two chromatih nucleoli join together to form one bivalent one in the growth period but in Edchistus tristigmus and Chariesterus the two frequently remain separate in the growth period yet this is not a complete separation for there would seem to be a linin connection between the two since they generally become more closely approximated at the time of the first maturation division when such a linin connection may be seen But in some of these species Peri balus COnus Trichopepla Coriscus besides the bivalent one are found one or two three or four in Trichopepla much smaller ones which appear to be univalent in the sperma tocytes whether these are represented in the spermatogonia or whether they arise in the spermatocytes for the first time I could not determine on account of their minuteness In Cyinus and Ichnodemus I could not determine the number in the spermatogonia but since here there is one bivalent one in the spermatocytes there would probably be two univalent ones in the spermatogonia The same would probably be true for Corizus and Leptopterna The Reduviidce and certain Capsidae show a larger number of chromatin nucleoli 204OF THE GERM CELLS OF METAZOA Thus in Acholla there are eight in the spermatogonia which form four bivalent ones in the spermatocytes in Sinea and Milyas there are three bivalent ones in the spermato cytes and accordingly probably six in the spermatogonia  in Prionidus there are appar ently five in the spermatogonia two of which unite in the spermatocytes to make one bivalent one while the three others remain univalent In Calocoris there are in the spermatocytes two bivalent and one univalent in Pecilocapsus lineatus one bivalent and one apparently univalent in P goniphorus certainly four and possibly five bivalent chromatin nucleoli in the spermatocytes In these forms one or more of the chromatin nucleoli may have their component parts more or less widely separated but these sepa rated components generally come together before the first maturation mitosis Bivalent chromatin nucleoli which have their components in close mutual apposition appear always to be transversely divided in the first maturation division reduction divi sion for the behavior of those which are univalent I refer to the chapter on  Observa tions Oncopeltus affords the interesting case where the two chromatin nucleoli of the spermatogonia are apparently each bivalentbivalent elements in a generation where all the chromatin elements are usually supposed to be univalent c The Peculiar Chromosome of Protenor In Protenorfor the details compare the description in the chapter on Observa tions there are two chromatin nucleoli in the spermatogonia which in the spermatocytes unite to form a bivalent one as we have just seen to be quite generally the rule in Hemiptera But the largest of the chromosomes of the spermatogonic mitoses the  chromosome x does not behave in the growth period of the spermotocytes like the other chromosomes but is similar to a chromatin nucleolus in preserving a compact form and in retaining the saffranine stain This is the odd chromosome the eleventh which does not combine with any other during the synapsis stage and which cannot be distinguished in the rest stage of the spermatogonia because there it behaves exactly like the other chromosomes and takes part in the formation of the nuclear reticulum This is the only case in the Hemiptera where one chromosome becomes differentiated into a chromatin nucleolus for the first time in the spermatocyte generation unless the minute chromatin nucleoli of Peribalus Ccenus Trichopepla and Coriscus may be found to have a similar history d Function All the observations show that the chromatin nucleoli are modified chromosomes which behave essentially like the chromosomes in mitosis but quite differently in the rest stage Paulmier 1899 has suggested that they are degenerate chromosomes This would 205MONTGOMERYA STUDY OF THE CHROMOSOMES seem to be true to some extent but not wholly correct for the following reasons In a large number of the species examined the chromatin nucleoli are regularly closely apposed to the surfaces of true nucleoli Now it seems probable that the true nucleoli are masses of substances formed by the metabolism of the cell probably waste substances Montgomery 1899 b When we find accordingly the mutual apposition of them to chromatin nucleoli it would be permissible to conclude that the chromatin nucleoli are chromosomes which are especially concerned with nucleolar metabolism And this I think would be the correct interpretation The chromatin nucleoli are in that sense de generate that they no longer behave like the other chromosomes in the rest stages but they would appear to be specialized for a metabolic function Thus it might be that in the Insects the chromatin nucleoli are those chromosomes which either exert a greater meta bolic activity than the other chromosomes or which carry out some special kind of meta bolism and from this point of view they would certainly seem to be much more than degenerate organs As to their origin compare the chapter on the  Number of Chromo somes Like the chromosomes the number of chromatin nucleoli in the germ cells appears to be a fixed one for the species In somatic cells they are often more numerous than in the germ cells however but that somatic difference will not be discussed in this paper which concerns itself with the germinal cycle e Occurrence Chromatin nucleoli were found by me in all the Hemiptera examined and I have found them also in Coleoptera Harpalus and Orthoptera Gryllus Ceutophilus McClung 1899 1900 has described them in various Orthoptera in some forms of which they are larger than the chromosomes Finally my student Miss Wallace 1900 has found them in the spermatogenesis of a spider Agalenid Accordingly they would seem to be present in the Insects and Arachnids but are apparently absent in the Crustacea and I have shown 1901 that they are not present in Peripatus It is however quite possible that they will be discovered in other forms if proper attention is paid to them The question of their ontogenetic origin will be considered later compare the section on the  Significance of the uneven number  of chromosomes 3 The Number

Whenever there is an even number of univalent chromosomes in the spermato gonia they unite in the synapsis to produce exactly half this number of bivalent chromosomes When there is an uneven number in the spermatogonia Alydus eurinus Harmostes Protenor Edancala all but one of the chromosomes unite in the synapsis to form bivalent chromosomes while the odd one remains single a Number and Genetic Relationship At the outset of the present study I was particularly interested to determine whether the numbers of chromosomes might afford clues to the relationship of the group of the Hemiptera heteroptera that is to learn if possible whether the number would afford a taxonomic criterion Most of the families of the Hemiptera are very rich in species however and I have been able to procure only a few species for study so that the present beginning must be continued on many more species before any conclusion can be reached In the Pentatomidce counting the chromosomes in the spermatogonia and not including the chromatin nucleoli we find the number varies between twelve and sixteen fourteen being most usual in the Coreidm we find twenty in Anasa and Jetapodius in Alydus eleven and twelve in Harmostes and Protenor eleven In the Lygceidce fourteen in Ichnodemus Peliopelta and Oncopeltus eleven in Edancala and probably twenty four in Cymus These were the three families of which the most species were examined From these numbers it will be seen that there is considerable variation in number for the different species of one and the same family Accordingly we must conclude either 1 that the number of chromosomes is easily modified and changed so that it has littleOF THE GERM CELLS OF METAZOA taxonomic value or 2 that the families of the Hemiptera heteroptera as they are at present defined are artificial and not natural groups I would incline to the latter view since all our facts would show that chromosomes are very conservative structures and that the germinal cycle is conservative probably the soma may be modified by the action of the environment to considerable extent before any such action would produce a change in the number of chromosomes If this standpoint is correct then the number of the chromosomes would be a very important consideration in d ciding the relationship of species thus the Coreidce would have to be subdivided into a subgroup with twenty to twentyfour chromosomes Anasa Jetapodius Chariesterus and into one with eleven or twelve chromosomes Alydus Corizus Harmostes Protenor But it would be a reductio ad absurdum to say that all forms with twelve chromosomes must be related or all forms with twenty the relative boundaries of a family must still be determined from the standpoint of broad comparative anatomy and then within a group so defined the chromosomal number might be used as a basis for further subdivision b Factors Determining the Number A problem of great importance and one that would seem to lie close to the root of all nuclear phenomena is that concerning the factors which determine the number of chromosomes The germ cells of each species have a fixed number of chromosomes but different species show a very different number from Ascaris megalocephala univalens with 2 up to Artemia with about 180 What is it that determines this numerical differ ence A consideration of the various thinkable factors allows us to limit the problem somewhat by excluding certain ones which are not real factors Here we may consider in what relation to chromosomal number stand centrosomes and achromatic spindle elements number of nucleoli mass of nucleus and cell body form of cell volume and form of chromosomes The size number and specific peculiarities of the centrosomes seem to have no connec tion with the number of the chromosomes The definite number of chromosomes appears in the prophases of mitosis while the nuclear membrane is still intact and when the cen trosomes are only commencing to exert an influence upon the other cell constituents Even the longitudinal splitting of the chromosomes would appear to be an automatic move ment on their part The centrosomes may well be centres of movements which produce the separation of the daughter chromosomes but there appears to be no correlation between the centrosomes and the chromosomal number And this seems also to be the case with regard to the spindle fibres Central spindle fibres and polar radiations may vary in their phenomena in different generations of the same species but the number of the chromosomes remains constant in all generations of the germ cells for the apparent 209MONTGOMERYA STUDY OF THE CHROMOSOMES halving of the number just before the maturation mitoses is not a real halving of the normal number but only a grouping into pairs And the mantle fibres those whicll connect the centrosomes with the chromosomes seem in fact to have their number deter mined to some extent by the number of the chromosomes and not to determine that number for the definite number of chromosomes appear in mitosis before the mantle fibres arise The number of the connective fibres those which connect corresponding daughter chromosomes in the anaphase is certainly determined by the number of the chromosomes for these fibres are stretchedout portions of the linin matrices of the chromosomes Thus the centrosomes and the achroinatic spindle structures may play a part in the dis tribution of the chromosomes but apparently have no pArt in the determination of their number As for the true nucleoli their number volume and position seem to be in no way regulative of the chromosomal number The nucleolar number in one species is gener ally variable and correlatively also the volume and position while the chromosomal number is constant in the paternal germ cells the number of nucleoli is frequently different and generally smaller than that in the maternal cells of a species but in both kind of cells the number of chromosomes is the same The mass of the nucleus or of the cell body or the relative mass of the two might seem a priori to stand in connection with the chromosomal number yet an examination of the facts shows this is probably not the case For instance in one species the huge ovocytes and the much smaller spermatocytes have the same number of chromosomes and a small ovogonium has the same number of chromosomes as a large ovocyte And in the case of the ovocyte the volume of the nucleus is relatively small in the spermatocyte rela tively large in proportion to the mass of tlle cell body yet the number of the chromo somes is the same The mass of the chromatin substance may be more or less proportion ate to the volume of the nucleus but the number of the chromosomes appears not to be the large number of chromosomes in Artemia as determined by Brauer is not correlated with a large nucleus and as the figures of the present paper show cells of approximately the same size from different species may show very different chromosomal numbers The form of the cell is regulated to great extent by external influences and variations in the form produce no modification of the chromosomal number The volume of the chromosomes in mitosis is dependent upon their number since the volume of the chromatin stands in more or less direct ratio to the volume of the nucleus The form of the chromosomes is more or less dependent upon their number inasmuch as long ribbonshaped chromosomes occur only where there are a small number and rounded ones where there are a larger number present Yet in all the Hemiptera with their considerable differences in chromosomal number the form of the chromosomes 210OF THE GERM CELLS OF METAZOA remains quite constant each univalent chromosome being generally slightly elongate Thus the form is not wholly dependent upon the number but particular groups of Jletazoa appear characterized by particular forms of chromosomes as e g the MIollusca with their rodshaped chromosomes Then the form of bivalent chromosomes is dependent upon the mode of junction of the component univalent elements In no sense however can the form of the chromosomes be said to determine their number So far our considerations lead to only negative results centrosomes and achromatic spindle structures nucleoli absolute and relative mass of nucleus and cytoplasm cell form and chromosomal form seem not to be factors determining the number of chromosomes As I attempted to show in a preceding paper on Peripatus 1901 the chromosomes must be regarded as individuals of a lower grade than what I termed the  nuclear element namely the linin spirem with the chromosomes arranged upon it The problem is really then why does this nuclear element show in one species a certain number of chromatin segregations in another species a different number  The more recent chemicophysio logical studies would tend to show that the chromosomes are centres of metabolic activity and accordingly the problem of the factors governing the chromosomal number may be closely connected with the phenomena of metabolism the number of the chromosomes may be dependent upon the nature of the metabolism as upon either the chemical nature of the chromosomes themselves or upon that of the cell nutriment The latter might be experimentally tested by changing the food of a species and observing whether differ ences in the number of the chromosomes might thereby be obtained But to conclude that the number of the chromosomes is dependent upon the nature of the metabolism does not solve the problem but only states it more precisely Another question which arises in this connection is whether a small or a large number of chromosomes is to be regarded as the primitive condition A priori it would appear probable tlhat at an early phyletic period the number of chromosomes was not fixed for the species but variable and that by a process of natural selection the number gradually became fixed But as a species gradually changes into another form the num ber of chromosomes may also be changed as will be shown in the next section so that we may speak of an evolution of the number of chromosomes On the principle of the law of greater condensation of organs in progressing evolution it might be that a large number of chromosomes represents a more primitive condition than a smaller number Within such a group as the Hemiptera heteroptera for instance forms like the Belosto matidse Reduviidce Capsidce and Phymatidce would be primitive in possessing a larger number of chromosomes while the Pentatomidce Scutellariidce and Lygcwidce in possess ing a smaller number should be regarded as more specializedmore highly developed From such a standpoint as this the chromosomal number would be of taxonomic 211MONTGOMERYA STUDY OF THE CHROMOSOMES valueit would be a signboard of degree of specialization within the group From such a point of view it might even be possible to construct a cellular classification which would have great value in that it would employ truly conservative structures The cen trosomes and central spindles have been considered phyletically in this way by Biitschli Lauterborn Heidenhain Calkins and others but so far the chromosomes have not been considered from such a standpoint although they in many respects appear more conserv ative than centrosomes and achromatic spindle structures Accordingly though the present study has not given a solution to the problem of the factors governing the number of chromosomes except in showing that it must be sought in the phenomena of metabolism yet it would show that chromosomal number may be employed as a criterion of relationship if it be used with caution and with due consid eration of a broad comparative treatment of other structures And the reason is because the chromosomes seem to be highly conservative their number constant for the species and because in a certain sense they represent the most important vital structures We should not conclude that all forms with e g ten chromosomes should be ranked as closely related all with e g twentyfour as composing another natural group But within a certain group which has been defined on a broadly comparative basissuch a group as the Hemiptera heteropterafor instance the chromosomal number would perhaps be a clue to the relative degree of specialization of the species c Significance of the uneven normal number One of the most unexpected results of this investigation was the discovery that in some species there is an uneven number of cllromosomes in the spermatogonia i e an uneven normal number whereas heretofore all observation and assumption has been that the normal number is always an even one Of the Hemiptera studied four species show an uneven number of chromosomes in the spermatogonia namely Alydus eurinus Har mostes reflexulus Protenor belfragei and CEdancala dorsalis in all of these the number is eleven and in the synapsis stage one chromosome remains univalent while the ten re maining combine to form five bivalent chromosomes What is the significance and origin of this uneven number  Now as far as our facts go it seems that the number of the chromosomes is constant for the species and that the paternal and maternal germ cells of a species have the same number this appears to be one of the points in the correspondence of the ovogenesis and spermatogenesis first determined by Henking 1890 and 0 Hertwig 1890 Whenever there is this correspondence in number and valence then in fertilization when the paternal chromosomes are added to the maternal an even number of chromosomes should result and if the chromosomes maintain their individuality through the succeed 212OF THE GERM CELLS OF METAZOA ing generations there should be an even number in the spermatogonia and ovogonia The uneven number discovered in the four species mentioned may have arisen in one of two ways through bastardization or through a mitotic abnormality each of which possibilities may now be considered In the case of bastardization of a germ cell with one chromosomal number by a germ cell from another species with a different number the uneven number eleven might be secured if a paternal germ cell of a species A with the normal chromosomal number twelve fertilizes a maternal germ cell of a species B with the normal number ten In species A the reduction in number of the chromosomes would give six univalent chromo somes in the spermatid and in species B five univalent chromosomes in the matured ovum conjugation of the two cells would then result in 6  5  11 univalent chromo somes In this way an uneven chromosomal number may have arisen by the conjugation of the germ cells of species with different numbers of chromosomes But the objection to this view lies in the fact that hybridization of distinct species is generally infertile and species which would have different chromosomal numbers would probably be quite distinct More probably then the uneven number may have originated through abnormalities of mitosis and there would be many possibilities for such an occurrence 1 It may have arisen in a spermatogonic mitosis in a species where the ancestral normal number is twelve by the chromatin of the spirem segregating abnormally into only eleven chromo somes so that one of these chromosomes would be virtually bivalent This would seem to have been the origin of the large odd chromosome x of Protenor belfragei which ap pears bipartite in the spermatogonia and also in the spermatocytes though in the latter it does not conjugate with any other chromosome Such a case would be a deficiency in the segregation of the chromatin in the prophases of mitosis 2 Or the uneven chromo somal number may have arisen by an unequal distribution of the chromosomes in the anaphases of mitosis so that the daughter cells would not receive equal numbers Now whether the uneven chromosomal number had originated through bastardiza tion or what would be more probable through abnormality in mitosis it is interesting to determine how this number can perpetuate itself through different generations of the species for my observations show that in the species where it is found it occurs in all individuals The following table gives in condensed form the mode of reduction of the chromosomal number and valence in the four species in question the chromatin nucleoli being omitted for the sake of simplicity 213214 MONTGOMERYA STUDY OF THE CHROMOSOMES SPECIES SPERMATOGONIUM

considered univalent as I have explained in an earlier portion of this paper however they must be regarded as semivalent on account of the absence of a rest stage between the maturation mitoses though they are virtually univa lent on account of their increase in mass during the growth period Protenor belfragei differs from the three other species in showing a bivalent chromosome in the spermatogo nium which chromosome is consequently bivalent in the first spermatocyte eventlthough it unites with no other during the synapsis stage All four species have in common the phenomenon that the odd chromosome does not conjugate with any other during the syn apsis stage but remains separate In Alydus eurinus Harmostes reflexulus and Protenor belfragei this odd chromosome does not divide in the second maturation mitosis but passes undivided into one of the two spermatids In Edancala dorsalis I was unable to deter mine its behavior in this mitosis though I have no reason to suppose that here it behaves differently from the other species This unequal distribution of the odd chromosome in the second maturation mitosis is evidently in some way dependent upon its not having united with a fellowchromosome during the preceding synapsis stage What concerns us particularly at present is the fact that in these species with an uneven normal number of chromosomes unlike those with an even number one chromosome the odd one is not divided in the second maturation mitosis but passes undivided into one of the daughter cells spermatids half of the spermatids then have six chromosomes and half have only five Bearing this point in mind let us see how the uneven chromosomal number may be perpetuated from individual to individual This may be occasioned by one of two possi bilities 1 The paternal germ cells having eleven chromosomes in the spermatogonia and either five or six in the spermatids there is the probability that the maternal germ cells ova may have a corresponding number of chromosomes If a spermatozoon withOF THE GERM CELLS OF METAZOA five or six chromosomes conjugates with an ovum with five or six so that each of the conjoints has the same number an even number would result in the fertilized ovum But if a spermatozoon with five or six chromosomes unite with an ovum with six or five the conjoints having then different numbers of chromosomes the fertilized ovum would have the uneven number eleven the uneven number would then be perpetuated from individual to individual so long as the conjugating cells have different numbers of chro mosomes and so long as the odd chromosome does not divide in one of the maturation mitoses 2 Or germ cells from individuals with an uneven normal number of chromo somes by conjugating with germ cells from individuals with an even number would occa sion an uneven number in the fertilized ovum Either of these possibilities would suffice to explain the te transference of the uneven number from individual to individual though the first possibility would appear the more probable So far we have considered the origin of the uneven chromosomal number and the mode by which it is perpetuated from individual to individual We have now to discuss its significance Most of the Hemiptera examined by me show an even normal number of chromosomes only four showed an uneven number and in no other Metazoa has an un even number to my knowledge been found The uneven number would accordingly appear to be unusual It seems to me probable that the uneven number represents a transition stage between a higher number and a lower or the converse and it is unusual because the transition stage is probably shorter than the earlier and the later stages The number of the chromosomes varies quite considerably in the different species of the Hemip tera heteroptera but we cannot suppose that the number was constant for each species from the beginning any more than we can consider that the species have always remained unchanged there must have been an evolution of the chromosomal number as there has been of the species It is quite possible that an even number of chromosomes as e g twelve may have changed into an even number ten without first passing through the stage of the uneven number eleven This might take place by the number ten appearing simultaneously in both paternal and maternal germ cells through some abnormality or deficiency in mitosis But it is far more probable that such a mitotic abnormality would not occur coincidently in both kinds of cellsmore probable eg that a paternal germ cell acquiring an abnormal number of chromosomes by some fault in the process of mitosis would conjugate with a maternal germ cell with the normal number the result of such a union would be of course an uneven number On this argument when the chromo somal number changes the period of change would be characterized by an uneven num ber of chromosomes Ultimately an even number of next lower or next higher order would be reached and that number must persist longer than the uneven number in view of the fact that uneven numbers are comparative rarities If both paternal and maternal A P SVOL XX BB 215MONTGOMERYA STUDY OF THE CHROMOSOMES germ cells gradually acquired the same uneven number of chromosomes then by conju gation of such cells similar numbers of chromosomes being added together a new even number would result But there is still another possibility by which the uneven number could pass into an even one The odd chromosome at least in the cases here described does not divide in the second maturation division and so behaves abnormally Now such an abnormally behaving chromosome might in time become differentiated from the other chromosomes and I venture the view that such odd chromosomes are on the way to be come chromatin nucleoli The main fact on which this conclusion is based is that in Protenor belfragei it is the odd the eleventh chromosomethe chromosome xwhich in the spermatocytic growth period evinces the phenomenmea of a chromatin nucleolus Then another correspondence is that the chromatin nucleoli in most Hemiptera act like the odd true chromosome in usually not dividing in the second maturation division Here we have an explanation for the origin of those peculiarly modified chromosomes the chro matin nucleoli thoroughly in accord with the facts I have described for them the chro matin nucleoli are modified chromosomes in point of origin the odd chromosomes which appear in the period of transition from a higher or a loer to a lower or higher even normal chromosomal number And there are generally two chromatin nucleoli in the spermatogonia because the odd chromosome in those cases where there is an uneven nor mal number had probably been formed in most cases as it certainly appears to have orig ignated in Protenor belfragei as a union of two univalent chromosomes which had failed to separate from one another in the spirem stage of the spermatogonic mitosis This also explains why the two chromatin nucleoli are generally placed close together in the monas ter stage of the spermatogonium they having been originally contiguous in the spirem thread Such an explanation of the origin of the chromatin nucleoli from the odd chromosomes seems to be in accord with all the facts and so far may be considered a true explanation rhe chromatin nucleoli are modified chromosomes and it is the odd chromosomes which become thus modified Conversely we should expect that chromatin nucleoli would be formed whenever the chromosomal number in changing from a higher to a lower one or the converse passes through a transition period of an uneven number Now as has been shown in the descriptive part of this paper and tabulated on page 207 all the Hem2iptera axamined have two chromatin nucleoli but some have a larger number Wherever there is a larger number we find generally that they are of different volumes and the question arises why this difference in volunie  The explanation might be that the largest ones are those most recently formed the smallest those which had been evolved at earlier periods and which are smaller because they are perhaps diminishing through a gradual degeneration If the chromatin nucleoli when once formed should always preserve their 216OF THE GREM CELLS OF METAZOA original size there should be no gradations in volumeno degeneration on their partso that in a given species we could determine by their number how many times the chromo somal number had changed But when new chromatin nueleoli are formed the older ones would seem to degenerate in the order of their formation This assumption would explain the occurrence of very minute chromatin nucleoli found in cells of certain Hemiptera along with much larger ones the minute ones would represent chromatin nucleoli formed at earlier periods now on the way to total degeneration and disappearance We might ex plain the general occurrence of one pair in the spermatogonia or of one bivalent one in the spermatocytes on the conclusion already reached in an earlier part of this paper that the chromatin nucleoli are metamorphosed for a special function different from that of the other chromosomes and so necessary for the nuclear activity and the reason for their de generation when new ones are formed in that a single pair would generally appear to be sufficient for this function so that not more than one pair would remain in functional activity at one time Thus we find that the unexpected discovery of an uneven chromosomal number in the spermatogonia opens the way to an explanation of certain phenomena and suggests others not anticipated It suggests that there is a gradual evolution in the numbers of chromosomes that they have not been fixed from the start but that with the evolution of the species the chromosomal number changes and at each change probably passes through a period with an uneven number In the Hemiptera this would seem to be in the forms examined a change from higher to lower numbers and in such a change the odd chromosome becomes metamorphosedbecomes a metamorphosed chromatin nucleolus If attention be given to these points in other groups of animals there can be little doubt that there too will be found occasional examples of uneven normal chromosomal num bers and probably also in some of these cases the production of structures comparable to the chromatin nucleoli of the Insects There is great need first of all however to deter mine for the Hemiptera whether in such cases there is a close correspondence between the spermatogonesis and ovogenesisthat correspondence I have assumed since I have not studied the ovogenesis 4 Considerations on the Cycle of the Germ Cells Here shall be considered in succession some points of broader interest which have arisen in the course of my studies on spermatogenesis a Ihe sequence of the stages of the cycle In the germ cells of the Metazoa there may be seen regular cycles of generations following upon one another In each cycle may be noted a stage of conjugation of ma 217MONTGOMERYA STUDY OF THE CHROMOSOMES ternal and paternal cells or stage of fertilization upon this follow a number of ovogonic or spermatogonic generations the exact number of which has not yet been determined for any metazoon the last generation of the ovogonia or spermatogonia give rise to ovocytes or spermatocytes of the first order and these are characterized by the synapsis stage and growth period when the reduction in the number of chromosomes is effected the synapsis stage being evidently coincident in all forms with the commencement of the growth period and finally occur two maturation divisions which result in the formation of ovo tids or spermatids The spermatids undergo an elaborate metamorphosis to become sper matozoa but since such a metamorphosis is not found in the ovotids we may disregard this stage which evidently is far less conservative than the others fronm the comparative standpoint the metamorphosis of the spermatozoon is of much less morphological signifi cance than the preceding stages of spermatogenesis and would appear from the recent investigations to be far more variable Thus each germinal cycle shows the following wellmarked stages conjugation or fertilization a stage of a number of ovogonic or spermatogonic generations the synapsis stage coincident with the growth period and the stage of the two maturation divisions Each such cycle is succeeded by a similar one and so on indefinitely for an indefinite number of cycles Now it is unthinkable that a cycle should be without a beginning it must have been gradually evolved and some particular stage in it must have been the starting point What was this first stage An answer is necessary before we can enter into the discussion of the meaning of the synapsis stage It appears to me most probable that the stage of conjugation of the germ cells must be considered the starting point For from the studies of R Hertwig and Maupas on Infusoria it appears probable that conjugation or fertilization is essentially a pro cess of rejuvenation cells may divide and reproduce for a number of generations asexually but there comes a period when the cellular vitality diminishes so that no further reproduction is possible except after rejuvenation afforded by conjugation with another cell When thus rejuvenated by admixture of substances from the other conjoint the cell starts upon a new period of generationthe period of conjugation thus being tlhe commencement of a cycle As we shall see the synapsis stage is really a delayed part of the process of conjugation and the growth period is induced by the synapsis of the chro mosomes Having determined the starting point of the germinal cycle we may now con sider the meaning of the synapsis stage b The phylogeny of chromosomes and the significance of the synapsis stage In the considerations that follow I assume that through the germinal cycle the chro mosomes preserve their individuality from generation to generationi e that a particular 218OF THE GERM CELLS OF METAZOA chromosome of one generation is represented in a particular one of a preceding so that chromosomes are not produced de novo in each generation The evidence for this assump tion as regards the Hemiptera has been already stated above cf the heading  The process of spermatogenesis in the Hemiptera  other evidence was shown in my study on Peripatus 1901 and there also the observations of other workers was considered in some detail so it is not necessary at this point to enter into these particulars Without this assumption which is an actuality as I have shown in some cases it would be very diffi cult to determine the meaning of the stages of the germinal cycle while on this assump tion much becomes clear and the phenomena of the synapsis stage alone are strongly corroborative of this assumption Now in the cycle of the germ cells there is a chromosomal peculiarity which has been described by other investigators but its significance has not been understood I referred to it in my study of Peripatus 1901 In the anaphases of the male and female pro nuclei as in the anaphases of the early cleavage cells it is characteristic that each chro mosome becames vesicular so that at this stage each daughter nucleus appears composed of as many such vesicles as there are chromosomes Each vesicle has its own limiting wall and not infrequently the different vesicles may be only loosely connected together ultimately however when the complete rest stage is attained the boundaries between the vesicles disappear so that the nucleus appears a whole without separated parts Riickert 1895 supposes the chromosomal vesicles to represent a shortened anaphase occasioned by the rapid sequence of the mitoses in the blastomeres that this is hardly a correct explanation is seen from the following considerations From the list of cases just mentioned in the footnote it will be seen that anaphases with vesicular chromosomes are found in the pronuclei and in the earlier cleavage cellsi e in nuclei at the beginning of the germinal cycle I have never seen such vesicular stages in the last generations of ovogonia and spermatogonia nor to my knowledge has any one else but in these later  This vesicular stage of the chromosomes in the anaphases of mitosis has been described by the following workers though this is probably not a complete list Remak 1855 cited by Henneguy 1896 blastomeres of

generally no such vesicular stage during the anaphaseit is then characteristic of embryonal cells of those at the commencement of the generative cycle An explanation of a possible reason for the chromosomal vesicles maintaining their independence was given in my paper on Peripatus 1901 where I referred it to the breaking of the linin spirem effected by the reduction mitosis and maintained that no continuous chromatin spirem could be formedi e no close juxtaposition of the chromosomes be effected until the linin spirem had become restored Probably the chromosomal individuality is maintained through all the generations of the cycle but the chromosomes seenm to show their independence most markedly in the early stages where it is strikingly evinced by their vesicular phenomena Each vesicle appears to be potentially a little nucleus with its ova wall its chromatic reticulum and caryolymph and sometimes with its own nucleoli This is very suggestive of the possi bility that each chromosome may represent from the phyletic point of view a nucleus and a metazoan nucleus would then be a symbiotic union of as many nuclei as there are chromosomes Such a conclusion might explain why the chromosomes pass through vesicular phases resembling nuclei in the earlier periods of the cycle So far we have seen that in the earlier portion of the germinal cycle the chromosomes remain more disconnected from one another than at later periods in the later periods those e g of the last generations of the spermatogonia and ovogonia they no longer show vesicular nuclearlike appearances in the anaphases and appear to be more dependent upon one anotherless independent Now another line of facts may be considered in this regard Van Beneden 1883 1887 first showed that in the fertilized egg of Ascaris the paternal and maternal chromosomes remain separated from one another so that in the prophases of the first cleavage mitosis a paternal and a maternal chromatin spirem is formed thus Van Beneden concluded a maintenance of the individuality of the pro nuclei Then Rickert 1895 found in the cleavage cells of Cyclops that the paternal and maternal chromosomes form two separate groups throughout the mitosis and that even in the rest stage there is a double nucleus half paternal and half maternal in the prophases there is a paternal chromatin spirem distinct from the maternal one Up to about the 32cell stage Riickert was able to find these double nuclei but found that in later cleavage stages they gradually decrease in number But Ruickert is probably in error when he concludes that the separation of the paternal and maternal chromosomes is retained even up to the time of the first maturation mitosis first pole spindle He bases this conclusion on the discovery that in the equatorial plane of the spindle at this stage the chromosomes are arranged ausnahmslos into two groups Now here the chromo 220OF THE GERM CELLS OF METAZOA somes are bivalent and eleven in number so that each group cannot have the same num ber Thus out of the cases examined by him in twelve cases the chromosomes were in groups of relatively equal number relation of six to five in two cases one group had four the other group seven chromosomes in three cases they were arranged in groups of three and eight respectively and in one case in groups of two and nine respectively Thus though there may be at the period of the first maturation mitosis an arrangement of the chromosomes into two groups yet the variable discrepancy in the number of the chromosomes composing te two groups shows th gat it is impossible that one group has only paternal chromosomes and the others only maternal for the reason that at the start in the fertilized egg paternal and maternal chromosomes are equal in number Accordingly Rickert has shown for Cyclops that the maternal and paternal chromosomes form separate groups up to about the 32cell stage when the separateness of these groups gradually disappears and his own descriptions and figures would show that at the time of the first maturation mitosis there is no longer a paternal group of chromosomes separate from a maternal group There could also be mentioned the observations of other authors to the effect that the paternal and maternal chromosomes compose separate groups in the early cleavage cells as especially the observations of my colleague Prof Conklin on the eggs of Crepidula Accordingly we have seen that in the earlier period of the germinal cycle at the time of fertilization and the immediately following generations paternal and maternal chromosomes remain separated from one another and also that the individual chromo somes show a remarkable degree of independence as evinced by their vesicular phenomena in the anaphases In the later stages of the germinal cycle on the contrary paternal and maternal chromosomes appear no longer to be arranged in separate groups and the chro mosomes themselves are no longer vesicular in the anaphases Now for the bearing of all this on the question of the significance of the synapsis stage At the commencement of the germinal cycle the stage of conjugation of the germ cells the chromosomes are more distinct from one another than at any later stage this distinctness gradually disappears as the cycle progresses and at the time of the synapsis stage the chromosomes actually join together to form half the normal number of bivalent chromosomes What chromosomes are these which unite to form pairs  Does a paternal chromosome unite with a paternal and a maternal with a maternal or does a paternal chro mosome unite with a maternal one The following considerations show that the latter view is probably the true one First of all in Ascaris megalocephala univalens there is the normal number of two chromosomes as Brauer 1893 b has demonstrated one of these is paternal the other maternal in origin since these two unite to form one bivalent one in the synapsis stage 221MONTGOMERYA STUDY OF THE CHROMOSOMES this would be a union of a paternal with a maternal chromosome Also in the Hemiptera whenever there are in the spermatogonia two chromosoiles which are distinguishable from the others by their greater size as in several species described in this papere g Protenor belfrageithese two especially large ones always unite together in the synapsis to form one bivalent one much larger than the other bivalent ones and one ot the large ones does not unite with a small one now it can be shown that one of these large chromosomes is paternal and the other is maternal For calling the two large chromosomes of the sper matogonia a and b respectively they unite in the synapsis to form the bivalent chromo some ab the first maturation mitosis here a reduction division gives a to one daughter cell second spermatocyte and b to the other the second maturation division of the one of these daughter cells gives to each spermatid a the corresponding division of the other daughter cell ib to each spermatid What we find in each of these spermatids is only one especially large chromosome and not two Accordingly in order for there to be two in the spermatogonia the egg cell must furnish one and then that one together with the one furnished by the spermatozoon in fertilization would make up the two Then of the two particularly large chromosomes of the spermatogonium one would be paternal and one maternal and since these two unite in the synapsis stage this would be a union of a paternal chromosome with a maternal chromosome A case where two particularly large chromosomes are distinguishable in the spermatogonia was selected for discussion because these two on account of their peculiarity in size can be recognized through the matura tion divisions but if the conclusion be true that one of the large chromosomes is paternal and one maternal and that these two join together in the synapsis then it would be very probable that each of the other bivalent chromosomes of the spermatocytes represents a univalent paternal chromosome united with a univalent maternal one This case as the one of Ascaris megalocephala univalens may be considered very positive cases in favor of the union of paternal with maternal chromosomes in the synapsis stage There is still another point of view which makes this conclusion very probable As we have seen whenever there is an even number of chromosomes in the spermatogonia exactly half that number of bivalent chromosomes are formed in the synapsis thus in Euchistus variolarius there are fourteen univalent chromosomes in the spermatogonia and seven bivalent ones in the first spermatocytes Now seven of these chromosomes are paternal and seven ma ternal since the spermatids have only seven The regular formation of seven bivalent chromosomes in the synapsis stage would be only possible if maternal chromosomes united with paternal ones For if on the contrary paternal chromosomes united with paternal and maternal with maternal then of the seven paternal chromosomes three bivalent ones could be formed but there would be left an ununited odd one and similarly of the seven maternal chromosomes there would remain an ununited univalent odd one But since 222OF THE GERM CELLS OF METAZOA in the first spermatocytes of Euchistus all the chromosomes are united into pairs so that there are no chromosomes remaining univalent it follows that in this case it is impossible that only chromosomes of like parentage should unite together These considerations render it very probable that in the synapsis stage is effected a union of paternal with maternal chromosomes so that each bivalent chromosome would consist of one univalent paternal chromosome and one univalent maternal chromosome This conclusion allows us to consider the synapsis stage in an entirely new light and gives an important significance to this stage The synapsis stage then which is characterized by the union of chromosomes into bivalent pairs may be considered the stage of the con jugation of the chromosomes When the spermatozoon conjugates with the ovum there is a mixture of cytoplasm with cytoplasm of karyolymph with karyolymph possibly also an internmixture of other substances but there is then no intermixture of chromatin for the chromosomes then as we have seen remain more separated from one anotlher than at any other stagein fact the paternal chromosomes seem to show a repulsion for the maternal inasmuch as they are arranged in two separate groups But after this begin ning stage of the germinal cycle the repulsion of the paternal for the maternal chromo somes gradually diminishes is generally no longer recognizable in the last of the spermato gonic and ovogonic divisions and in the synapsis stage instead of a repulsion we find a posi tive attraction between the paternal and maternal chromosomes The reason for the final union of these chromosomes is obvious it is evidently to produce a rejuvenation of the chromosomes From this standpoint the conjugation of the chromosomes in the synapsis stage may considered the final step in the process of conjugation of the germ cells It is a process that effects the rejuvenation of the chromosomes such rejuvenation could not be produced unless chromosomes of different parentage joined together and there would be no apparent reason for chromosomes of like parentage to unite At the same time the socalled reduction in the number of the chromosomes is effected but this is probably not primal but rather a necessary result of the conjugation of the chromosomes And here the point may be made that really there takes place no reduction in the number of the chromosomes in the germinal cycle but  reduction in number is simply a conveni ent phrase for expressing that in the synapsis the chromosomes unite to form pairs no chromosomes have been lost there is in the strict sense no reduction in number So we find that the synapsis stage has a very broad and important significance of all the stages in the germinal cycle second only to the initial stage of conjugation of the germ cells In the synapsis stage we see the final process in the conjugation of the germ cells namely the conjugation of the chromosomes Now following immediately upon the syn apsis stage comes the growth period of the spermatocytes and ovocytesthat period when the germ cells attain volumes greater than at any other period in the germinal cycle A P SVOL XX CC 223MONTGOMERYA STUDY OF THE CHROMOSOMES Very evidently this great increase in volume is effected by that rejuvenescence of the chro mosomes secured by their conjugation For the chromosomes are centres of metabolic activity by conjugation of paternal with maternal chromosomes in the synapsis stage their metabolic functions are rejuvenated and this rejuvenation finds its expression in the great changes of the growth period So this explanation of the synapsis stage would seem to be in accord with all the facts known at present It is quite possible that at an earlier period in the phylogeny the conjugation of the chromosomes may have taken place at the time of the conjugation of the germ cells and not have been separated from that stage by a number of generations as in the modern Metazoa But the determination of the original time of occurrence of the conjugation of the chromosomes is highly speculative and so will not be entered upon here It is generally stated eg Von Rath 1893 Rlickert 1894 that the bivalent chro mosomes of the spermatocytes and ovocytes of the first order are produced  by the spirem segmenting into only half the normal number of chromosomes This is not a correct statement since in the prophases of the first maturation mitosis there is as I have shown in my paper on Peripatus no stageof a continuous chromatin spirem Further this general statement is not at all explanatory of the formnation of bivalent chromosomes for it does not express any reason why the chromosomes should be joined into pairs It is to Moore 1895 that we owe the first clear characterization and estimation of the synapsis stage he divided the germninal cycle into the  first period conjugation of germ cells spermatogonic and ovogonic divisions the  synaptic phases  coincident with the growth period and the  second period  maturation divisions It will be seen that my own classification of the stages is somewhat more detailed than Moores though it is not necessarily any better The important characteristic of the synapsis stage is of course the union of chromosomes into bivalent pairs the exact details of this process which appear to differ in different groups are of secondary significance c The significance of the maturation divisions The two maturation divisions of the Metazoa represent the terminal stages of the germinal cycle In the Copepods Hacker 1895 Riickert 1894 the Isopods Oniscus in a just finished paper by my student Miss Louise Nichols in the Insects Von Rath 1892 Henking 1890 Montgomrery Paulmier 1899 McClung 1900 and in Peripatus Mont gomery 1901 there are well demonstrated cases that one of the maturation divisions is a reduction division pseudoreduction Riickert 1894 in that it accomplishes a separation of entire univalent chromosomes from one another Such a reduction division a trans verse splitting of the chromosomes is not known for any other generation of the germinal cycle nor for any somatic generation 224OF THE GERM CELLS OF METAZOA But in Ascaris Brauer 1893 b in Salamandra Meves 1896 in the Rat Len hossek 1898 in Selachii Moore 1895 and in Amphiuma McGregor 1899 the au thorities cited agree that both maturation divisions are equational Now it does not seem a priori probable that in some Metazoa a reduction division should occur and in othlers not The case of Ascaris would seem to show no sign of a reduction division for Brauers careful study apparently shows that each bivalent chromosome becomes split longitudi nally twice yet Sabaschnikoffs more recent study 1898 would show that another inter pretation of the phenomena is possible but not proved namely that the chromatin microsomes may become rearranged into fours in such a way that one of the maturation divisions may be reductional In the Salamander Flemming 1887 showed that the mitosis of the first generation of spermatocytes has remarkable peculiarities so that he named it a heterotypic mitosis The most remarkable of its characteristics is that the chromosomes are longitudinally split in shape like horseshoes and that they open up into the forms of rings the ends of the daughter horseshoes retaining their mutual connection Such a heterotypic mitosis was corroborated by Meves in his description of the spermato genesis of Salarnandra and it has been shown to be characteristic of the first maturation division in Selachii the Rat and Aimphiuma by Moore Lenhossek and McGregor respec tively All these writers show that the heterotypic mitosis results in a longitudinal division of the chromosome and there can be no reasonable doubt of the correctness of their descriptions But I think they are mistaken in concluding that because the hetero typic division is a longitudinal division of the chromosomes that therefore it is an equa tion division For the chromosomes of these spermatocytes are bivalentthere are just half as many in the spermatocytes as in the spermatogonia Since there is no loss of chromosomes in the spermatocytes there must take place a union of univalent chromo somes into pairs during some part of the growth periodi e in the synapsis stage I venture the view that in the Vertebrates either 1 the bivalent chromosomes are formed by every two univalent chromosomes becoming apposed to one another side to sidei e along their whole length so that the two would compose a double horseshoeor 2 by the two ends of one univalent chromosome becoming closely connected with the two ends of the other so that the whole would have the form of a ring From what has been described for these bivalent chromosomes we know that the longitudinal split does not divide their ends but the ends are unsplit Accordingly it would appear probable that the essential process in the formation of these bivalent chromosomes is that the two ends of one univa lent chromosome become united with the two ends of another while it would be of secon dary importance whether the two chromosomes might be apposed along their whole lengths or not Moore states that the second maturation division is also heterotypic but his figures do not prove his point which needs reexaminationc 225MONTGOMERYA STUDY OF THE CHROMOSOMES But from tbis it would follow that the heterotypic mitosis of the first spermatocytes of the Vertebrates is really a reduction division and results in the separation of whole univalent chromosomes Then the longitudinal split of such bivalent chromosomes would be really the space between two univalent chromosomes Thus though these chromosomes may appear in the prophases longitudinally split yet a separation of the daughter chromo somes along the line of this split would not be an equational division The workers on vertebrate spermatogenesis have indeed shlown that the bivalent chromosomes are split longitudinally but since none of them have succeeded in demonstrating how the bivalent chromosomes are formed in the synapsis stage they could not show the significance of this longitudinal split For Peripatus and the Hemiptera I have shown that a bivalent chromosome is produced by one end of one univalent chromosome uniting with one end of another while in the Vertebrata if my interpretation is correct a bivalent chromosome would be produced by the union of both ends of one univalent chromosome with both ends of anotherthe spermatogonic chromosome is Ushaped the spermatocytic chromo some is ringshaped since it represents two such Ushaped elements with their ends coil nected Also in Peripatus and the Hemiptera there are occasionally ringshaped chro mosomes similar to the heterotypic chromosomes of Vertebrates and they are formed by the two ends of one univalent chromosome being joined with the two ends of another instead of one end being joined simply with one end This interpretation explains and the process has never been satisfactorily explained before why one of the maturation mitoses in Vertebrates is heterotypic it is a reduction division separating entire univalent chromosomes and it differs from all other mitoses of the germinal cycle because it is the only one of them which does separate entire chro mosomes If this view is true then probably all JWetazoa would have in common the occurrence of one reduction division and we should no longer be confronted by the dis crepancy between Jfetazoa with and those without a reduction division The occurrence of a reductioin division is actually proved for the Copepoda Insecta Oniscus and Pcri patus I shall not mention other objects where it has been rendered probable but not thoroughly proven a priori we should expect that one would occur in the Vertebrates also and in thle Vertebrates there does occur a peculiar heterotypic division which as we have seen can be satisfactorily explained as a reduction division Accordingly the term  heterotypic mitosis might be applied to any mitosis which results in the separation of whole univalent chromosomes irrespective whether it divides the bivalent chromosome transversely or longitudinally the term  heterotypic  is indeed most excellent in that it expresses a mitosis  of a type of a different kind one differing from all other mitoses of the germinal cycle Of very secondary importance then would be the form of the chromosomesnot the form but the way in which the chronmosomes divide should be 226OF THE GERM CELLS OF METAZOA taken as the criterion of the heterotypic mitosis This signification would be different from that originally defined by Flemming 1887 but it would certainly be a step toward greater clearness to use  heterotypic division in the place of the promiscuously used reduction division Now that we have seen that a reduction division occurs in the Copepoda Insecta Onis cus and Peripatus and that the heterotypic division of the Vertebrata may be interpreted as a reduction division also we liave to try to explain why such a reduction division occurs In the synapsis stage there is a conjugation of paternal with maternal chromosomes for the purpose of rejuvenation of the chromosomes as metabolic centres and this rejuvenation is exemplified in the great metabolic activity of the growth period Now R Hertwig and Maupas have shown for the Infusoria that the two conjoints remain for only a certain period in apposition and that when the interchange of nuclei necessary for rejuvenation has been accomplished the conjoints separate Of course it is not a true analogy to com pare conjugating Infusoria i e whole cells with conjugating chromosomes i e por tions of cells But still it is very probable that two chromosomes unite temporarily for the same reason that two Infusoria do that is for an interchange of substances and when the chromosomes have accomplished this interchange there would no longer be any necessity for continued apposition so they tend to separate from one another It is the reduction division in Metazoa which accomplishes the complete separation though it may commence in the prophases of this division It is conceivable that the conjugated chro mosomes might separate as they had come together without the intervention of a mitosis But in the Metazoa so far as we know they become separated only by the agency of a mitosis and that is the reduction mitosis At the beginning of the germinal cycle there is a repulsion of paternal and maternal chromosomes for one another during the synapsis a strong attraction and at the end of the germinal cycle a repulsion again but not a re pulsion so strong as to distribute the chromosomes into two groups in the sperinatid and ovotid Only by a reduction division can paternal and maternal chromosomes become wholly separated for only then do the interchromosomal linin fibres persisting portions of the linin spirem compare my paper on Peripatus become broken The question is complicated because another maturation division occurs an equa tional division in the Insecta Oniscus Peripatus and the Vertebrates the reduction division precedes the equational in the Copepoda according to Riickert 1894 the re verse is the case It is not difficult to explain why an equation division should occur at this time for the cell has increased in volume very greatly during the growth period and great increase in volume increase beyond thle individual mass would appear to be a main factor in inducing cell division With this increase in volume of the cell the chromo somes also increase in volume though by no means in a direct ratio and each univalent 227MONTGOMERYA STUDY OF THE CHROMOSOMES component of a bivalent chromosome divides into two longitudinally equationally this being the usual mode of division of a chromosomein fact the only known method of re production of univalent chromosomes From this standpoint the growth period would be the inducer of the equational maturation mitosis and this mitosis would be strictly comparable physiologically to any other equation mitosis of the germinal cycle But at the time that the cell is preparing for this equation division paternal and maternal chromosomes having accomplished the purpose which occasioned their conjugation show a tendency to repulsion for each other and so evince the need of becoming disconnected The cell already started into mitotic activity would offer mechanical possibilities to effect the separation of the maternal from the paternal chromosomes so that instead of a single mitotic process there are two in rapid succession sometimes with not a trace of a rest stage in between one separating entire univalent chromosomes the other separating the halves of each univalent chromosome It would be very enticing to enter here into the me chanics of this mitosis which would be practically a determination of the points of appo sition of the mantle fibres on the chromosomes but such an inquiry is hardly germane to the present discussion The point to be made is that in the AJetazoa there follows after the growth period an equation mitosis because in the growth period the cell has in creased beyond the normal size and that a reduction division occurs about the same time in order to affect a complete separation from one another of the paternal and maternal chromosomes which having accomplished the purpose for which they conjugated show again a repulsion for each other The growth period is the inducer of the equation di vision the mutual repulsion of chromosomes of different parentage the inducer of the reduction division The chromosomes in the late anaphases after the maturation divis ions become vesicular and so show a great degree of mutual independence because the reduction division had severed their linin connections In conclusion it would be very interesting to enter into the question of the parallel ism of the germinal cycle in ftetazoa and Protozoa as has been done by Henking and Moore 1895 However it would be well first to have ascertained the significance in the cycle of the Metazoa as far as that can be done without reference to the states in the Protozoa The chromosomes are the cell components on which the problem can be best studied 228OF THE GERM CELLS OF METAZOA 229 IV LITERATURE

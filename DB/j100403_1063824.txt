mandamus does not lie to compel a private corporation to register on its books a transfer of corporate stock Spangenberg v Western etc Iron Co Cal 135 Pac 1127 A transferee of shares of capital stock may always maintain an ac tion at law for damages when the corporation wrongfully refuses to register the transfer Baltimore Ry Co v Sewell 35 Mo 238 6 Am Rep 402 Protection Life Ins Co v Osgood 93 Ill 69 On the ground that damages at law afford an inadequate remedy courts of equity have taken jurisdiction to compel a corporation to register the transfer For various reasons the shares themselves often furnish the motive of the purchase Feckheimer v Nat Exch Bank 79 Va 80 Cushman v Thayer Mfg Co 76 N Y 365 31 Am St Rep 437 Scherk v Montgom ery 81 Miss 426 33 So 507 Madison v Price 79 Kan 289 100 Pac 280 By the weight of authority mandamus is not the proper remedy Ship ley v Mechanics Bank 10 Johns N Y 484 Stackpole v Seymour 127 Mass 104 Freon v Carriage Co 42 Ohio St 30 31 Am Rep 794 State ex rel Galbraith v Peoples Association 43 N J L 389 Contra in some juris dictions where the duty to register a transfer is specially prescribed by law and an ordinary action for damages would afford incomplete re lief Slemmons v Thompson 23 Ore 215 31 Pac 514 Dennett v Acme Mfg Co 106 Me 476 76 Atl 922 Amnidon v Elevator Co S D 132 N W 166 A distinction has been made between quasipublic and purely private corporations holding that mandamus may be issued to an officer of the former as he is in a sense a public officer The State ex rel Townsend v Mclver 2 S C 25 This distinction would seem un sound because in either case the duty owed the transferee is equally private In Georgia it is held that mandamus will lie where the shares have been sold at a judicial sale to compel the president of the corpora tion to transfer them to the purchaser on the books of the company on the ground that he is an officer of the court pro hac vice Bailey v Strockecher 38 Ga 259 Under other circumstances the writ is de nied Bank of Ga v Harrison 66 Ga 696 In no case will mandamus lie where the legal right to the shares is not clear and undisputed Townes v Nichols 73 Me 515 Burnsville Turnpike Co v State ex rel McCalla 119 Ind 382 20 N E 421 POLICE POWERSTERILIZATION LAWSVALIDITYA statute provid ing for the sterilization of feebleminded persons indluding idiots imbeciles and morons epileptics rapists certain criminals and de fectives confined in the public institutions of the state Held invalid because an unreasonable classification Smith v Board of Examiners of FeebleMinded N J 88 Atl 963 In this case the court without passing on the power of the state to subject its citizens to surgical operations to render procreation by them impossible declared the statute invalid because by its terms it embraced only such individuals of the class named as were confined in the public institutions of the state such being an arbitrary classifi cation bearing no reasonable relation to the object of such police 414RECENT DECISIONS regulation and accordingly denying to the persons included the equal protection of the laws A statute providing for the sterilization of rapists has been held not to impose a cruel or unusual punishment State v Feilen 70 Wash 65 126 Pac 75 41 L R A N S 418 Here however the sole question decided was the legality of sterilization as a mode of punishment Sterilization laws are more properly placed under the police power The principal object of such laws is not to punish but to promote the health welfare and good order of the state by preventing procreation by certain classes of its citizens on the theory that heredity plays an important part in the transmission of feeblemindedness criminal tendencies and other defects It would seem though that the principle of heredity is still open to question and that all the phases of the subject are by no means fully known See 4 JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL LAW AND CRIMINOLOGY 326 Has the state then the power to enact such legislation Vasectomy the operation for the sterilization of men is a simple operation hardly more serious than vaccination Salpingectomy the corresponding operation for women is a serious operation requiring anaesthetics and endangering the life of the patient Has the state the power to risk the life of a citizen for the sake of a theoretical future benefit Either of these operations is such an interference with the liberty of the individual as to call for careful consideration Compulsory vaccination laws are upheld Jacobson v Massachusetts 197 U S 11 The effects of vaccination though are well known the operation is not dangerous nor does it result in any change of the constitution of the subject Reasonable restrictions on the right to marry based on the future benefit to the health and well being of the community are upheld Thus in the case of a statute prohibiting marriage with an epileptic Gould v Gould 78 Conn 242 61 Atl 604 It is suggested that such laws open a danger ous field of legislation though the good might outweigh the evil were they confined within certain limits Thus it would seem that the theory of heredity is well proven in cases of insanity But such laws do not stop here They generally include criminals also and the heritability of criminal tendencies is by no means an undisputed proposition It might be possible to extend this policy so as to embrace persons whose heritable qualities are undesirable or unpopular Such statutes though are widely enacted The following states have passed such laws though they have been before

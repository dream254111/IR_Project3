InvitedWhere plaintiff about nighttime called at defendants house for the purpose of seeing de fendants wife on a matter of business and entered a side door which was customarily used and passed into a vestibule from which sev eral doors opened and she knocked at one of them whereupon de fendants wife who was in the house without ascertaining where plaintiff was knocking called to her to Come in and opening the dcor plaintiff fell into the cellar and sustained injuries defendant was notliable Error to Circuit Court Elizabeth City County Action by Ernstein Fehlhaber against Reuben 0 Clark Judg ment in favor of plaintiff and defendant brings error Re versed demurrer to the declaration sustained and cause dis missed S Gordon Cumming and S J Dudley for plaintiff in error Ashby  Read for defendant in error WHITTLE J The defendant in error was the plaintiff in the lower court and brought an action against the plamtiff in error to recover darhages for personal injuries sustained by the plain tiff in falling down a flight of steps leading into a cellar under the dwelling house of the defendant There was a demurrer to the declaration which the court over ruled whereupon the defendant pleaded not guilty and upon trial of that issue a jury having been waived the court assessed the plaintiffs damages at 750 and rendered judgment accordingly To that judgment the defendant brings error The gravamen of the declaration is that the plaintiff conducted a dressmaking establishment in the town of Phoebus that the wife of the defendant became a customer of the plaintiff and engaged her services to do certain work at her shop that in con nection with that employment it became necessary for the plain tiff to call at the residence of the defendant that though there is a front entrance to the defendants premises it is customary for a person going there on a mission such as the plaintiffs to enter by the side or back entrance that this is expected and the premises are so arranged as to give visitors notice of that fact that on the evening of the accident about nighttime the plaintiff approached the defendants dwelling by the route in dicated and entered an open vestibule or hallway in the building and observing several doors opening on the vestibule which 382  SeptCLARK 7J FEIHLIABER seemed to lead into the house but not knowing through which door she was expected to enter knocked upon one of the said doors which she took to be the right one and which led con spicuously off of the said open entrance and thereupon the de fendant from the inside of the house without attempting to as certain where the plaintiff was so knocking instructed her to Come in and that the plaintiff acting wholly upon such invita tion and reasonably believing that she was knocking at a door which led into the said house attempted to go through the said door when she was suddenly precipitated forward headlong down a steep flight of stairs into a cellar of the existence of which she was ignorant and sustained the injuries on which her action is founded If we assume as we must ssume on demurrer to the declara tion that the plaintiff went upon the premises of the defendant lawfully and by implied invitation inasmuch as her errand con cerned the business of the defendants wife the law is well set tled that it was the duty of the defendant to exercise ordinary care to have the premises in reasonably safe condition for the visit Cooley on Torts 718 Shear  Red on Neg 3d Ed 499a Beach on Cont Neg 3d Ed 79 80 R  M Ry  Morris Admr 94 Va 493 27 S E 70 37 L R A 258 But the defendant was in no sense the insurer of the safety of the plaintiff and all she was entitled to demand or expect was that while exercising reasonable care for her own safety the de fendant would likewise use ordinary care not to expose her to danger Ordinary care then in this instance was the measure of the defendants duty to the plaintiff and the law imposed no higher degree of responsibility upon him There is no rule of law which denies to the defendant the right to have a cellar under his residence nor was there any such defect in connection with the location or construction of the entrance to the cellar in question as would fix upon the de fendant want of ordinary care with respect to it The opening was guarded by a closed door and in the exercise of ordinary care the defendant could not have anticipated that a person un acquainted with the locality and casually visiting the premises would open a closed door in the dark and precipitate herself down the cellar steps nor can he be responsible for such mis chance Kaiser v Hirth 46 How Prac N Y 161 To hold the defendant liable the injury must have been the natural and probable result of his conduct and one which in the light of surrounding circumstances he ought reasonably to have foreseen might probably occur Simmons z McConnell 86 Via 494 10 S E 838 R  D R Co v Yeamans 90 Va 752 19 S E 787 1907 383384 13 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Sept Nor is the pretension of the plaintiff strengthened by the fact that the defendant while in another room entering on the vesti bule in response to her knock bade her enter His invitation was not for the plaintiff to enter the cellar but the room in which he was The accident was manifestly the result of a misapprehension on the part of both plaintiff and defendant and to which both innocently contributed the defendant by failing to accurately locate the source of the plaintiffs rap and the plaintiff to cor rectly determine whence the responsive invitation to enter pro ceeded In other words the injury was proximately occasioned by mutual misunderstanding responsibility for which if any body was in fault attached to both alike In such case the law cannot undertake to apportion the blame but must leave the parties where it finds them The rule is thus stated If the proximate cause of an injury was negligence of both plaintiff and defendant concurring and cooperating together plaintiff is not entitled to recover Rich mond Traction Co v Martins Admr 102 Va 209 45 S E 886 Richmond P  P Co v Gordon 102 Va 498 46 S E 772 In the case of Newport News etc Elec Co v Clark 105 Va 205 52 S E 1010 the following quotation is made from the decision of Judge Cooley in Sjogren v Hall 53 Mich 274 18 N W 812 The fact that it the accident was avoidable does not prove that there was fault in not anticipating and providing against it If a farm laborer falls from the haymow the fall does not demonstrate that the farmer was culpable for not railing the mow in A man stumbling in a blacksmith shop might have his hand or even his head thrown under the trip hammer but it would not follow that there had been any neglect of duty on the part of the blacksmith in leaving the hammer ex posed So far as there is a duty resting upon the proprietor in any of these cases it is a duty to guard against probable dangers and it does not go to the extent of requiring him to render ac cidental injury impossible    If the fact that prevention was possible is to render the employer liable then he may as well be made an insurer of the safety of those in his service in express terms for to all intents and purposes he would in law be insurer whether nominally so or not The cases of Hilsenbeck v Guhring 30 N E 580 131 N Y 674 and Ryerson v Bathgate 57 L R A 307 67 N J Law 337 51 Atl 708 are very much in point In the former case Guhring who was the guest of Hilsenbeck at his home in the city of Brooklyn descended from the upper floor of the dwelling where the defendant and his wife resided to the first floor toCLARK V FEHLHABER make use of the watercloset The stairs terminated in a hall in which the watercloset was located The hall at the time was dark receiving no other light than came from a window over the street door and as the day was dark this was insufficient to clear the darkness from the hall There were three doors in the hallone leading into the saloon the next to the basement and the third to the watercloset The basement door was partially open and the plaintiff supposing that to be the door of the watercloset passed through it and fell down the stairs into the basement below breaking his leg A gas jet was main tained in the hall but was not at the time lighted All the judges present concurred in the opinion that there could be no recovery In the second case the plaintiff Mrs Ryerson went upon the defendants premises at their request to deliver a domestic cat which she had given them For that purpose she made two visits to the defendants As the plaintiff arrived the first time the cat jumped from her arms and ran home A few days later she returned and on entering the establishment she told one of the proprietors that he must put the cat in a closet or else she would run away again whereupon he walked to the opposite side of the room opened a door and said Put her in here Plaintiff supposing it to be a closet as she had requested him to put the cat in a closet and the door being only partially opened she ran in with the cat in her arms It was scratching her and she stooped to put it down and fell down a flight of stirs leading to the cellar and was injured She did not see beyond the door partly be cause it was dark there and partly because a butchers frock was hanging on the door The court in part observed The plaintiffs injury did not result from any defect in the doorway or in the staircase So far as the case shows there was no such defect She was injured because she inferred that the door way led to a closet and thereupon attempted to enter without taking observations herself or making further inquiries Was she justified in doing so The case presents an instance of express invitation In order to discover its extent the words used by Silvernail are to be considered with reference solely to the plaintiffs expressed purpose and the act which accompanied his response She said to Silvernail You must put her the catl in a closet or she will run away again He said You put her in here and partially opened the door This amounted to a decli nation of her request that he should take the cat and put it in a closet It did not even amount to a representation that the place indicated was a closet in the ordinary acceptation of that term By what he said and did he merely represented that the door opened into a place which when the door was promptly closed 4 1907 385386 13 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Sept again would securely detain the cat She had expressed no pur pose to enter with the cat Held plaintiff could not recover We are of opinion that the law on the demurrer to the decla ration is with the defendant and that it ought to have been sustained The judgment must therefore be reversed and this court will make such order as the circuit court ought to have made sus taining the demurrer and dismissing the case Note One who invites another expressly or by implication to come upon his premises must use ordinary care and prudence to render the premises reasonably safe for the visit Richmond etc R Co v Moore 94 Va 493 27 S E 70 Nichols v Washington

by it thereby invites the public to visit it and witness its ascension and is liable in damages for an injury to a visitor resulting from negligently permitting the falling of a pole used in preparing for said ascension It is immaterial whether the person making the ascent is an independent contractor or not or whether the visitor went to the park on the city cars or by some other mode of copveyance The gist of the action is the negligent failure of the defendant to use proper care to protect the visitor from a danger on its premises while there at defendants invitation Where the direct and usual path to a railroad companys depot lies over a switch on which often stand freight cars with an opening left between two of them so as to leave the path unobstructed and this path is habitually used by the patrons and employees of the company with the knowledge and without the disapproval of the officials it may be assumed that the company invites persons having business at the depot to use that path between the cars to go there and in using it for that purpose such persons are not guilty per se of negligence and if by a sudden unsignaled act of the companys servants the cars are run together thereby crushing such a person the company is liable in damages for the injury Nichols v Washington etc R Co 83 Va 99 5 S E 171

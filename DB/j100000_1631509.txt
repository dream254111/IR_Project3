Agassis approving the correctioll but in view of the confusion that might arise I propose to retain the name Gonzonem7ls originally given the genus by Professor Agassiz and would like to urge that future writers use this form  I2 ZIURBACH IETROIT 1WIC1I BOTAXlCAL YOTES MOSSES DR A J G1l0UT has just published  Mosses with HalldLens and Bicroscope Part I as a quarto pamphlet of 86 pages This is a tnontechnical handbook of the more com mon mosses of northeastern Uni1ed States and is the outgrowth of  Mosses with a Hand Lens published by the same author a few years ago After a brief introduction chapters are given dealing with classification and nomen clature collection and preservation mounting tand methods of mallipulation The life his tory and structure of the 1u0 plant are then given in some deail Since the peristome is of considerable importance in indicating the Telationships of mosses the discussion of its structure is given due prominence in this sec tion An illustrated glossary of bryological terms constitutes a valuable feature of the work After listing the more important works on mosses for American studetts the author takes up the systematic study of the more common forms The key to the families is followed by the treatment of the Sphagnaceae Andreacese Georgiaceae PolytriGhacese Bus baumiacese Fissidentaceae and Dicranacee in part leaving the remainder of the tvwenty searen families recognized for treatment in subsequent parts four to five parts in all will be issued The classification adopted does not deviate very much from that given in Iixon and Jamesons IIandbook of British Mosses In the matter of changes in nomen elature the author has been quite conservative The work is illustrated with a considerable number of figures in the text besides ten full page plates The fact that the latter are reproductions from  Recherches sur les Mousses by Schimper Bryologia Europea and Sullivants  Icones BLuscorum  is suffi cient guarantee for their excellence The purpose of the work is best given in the words of 1he author  To give by drawings and descriptions the information necessary to en able any one interested to become acquainted with the more common mosses with the least postible outlay of time patience and money but we doubt if the authors prediction  that it luakes the mosses as easy to study as the flowering plants will ever be realized The beginning student will find Dr Grouts pululication a very valuable aid and by those who do not have the more exhaustive treatises at their command it will be especially prized ATORPEOLOGY OF ANGIOSPERMS STUDENTS of morphology will welcome the appearance of lWorphology of Angiosperms by Dr J M Coulter and Dr Chas J Cham berlain from the press of D Appleton  CO It is worthy of note that this work is not issued as Part II of the  Morphology of Spermatophytes as was the intention when its companion volume dealing with the Gym nosperms was published in 1901 This may be taken as a protest against considering the Spermatophytes as a group coordinate with the Pteridophytes The present volume to use the authors words  Has grown out of a course of lectures accompanied by laboratory work given for several successive years to classes of graduate students preparing for research It seeks to organize the vast amount of scattered ma terial so that it may be available in compact and related form ASter a brief introduction the following sequence of chapters is taken up The flower the microsporangium the mega sporangium the female gametophyte the male gametophyte fertilization the endo sperm the embryo The chapter on the micro sporangiuln ends with the formation of the mothercells and with their division the his tory of the male gametophyte is enteredSEPTEMBER 18 1903  SCIENCE 376 This line of separation is supported by the argulnents of Strasburger but even Stras burger has been known to ohange his opinions To begin the gametophyte with the germina ting spore certainly gives us a much clearer eonception of the alternation of generations The history of the megasporangium is like wise terminated by the ormation of the mothercells for their division is a reduction division which is used as the bZasis of separa tion of sporophyte and gametophyte In the history of the male gametpphyte the view that the tubecell is the antheridium wall that develops a tubular outgrowth  while the generative cell and its products is the sperma togenous part of the antheridium  is given the preference A careful reading of the chapter on the female gametophyte shows that the germination of the megaspore and forma tion of the gametophyte is not such a uni form process as most of our standard te2ats describe In dealing with fertilization  double fertilization  is given due prominence and the authors object to the use of the term as they consider it far from established that a real fertilization takes place hence they prefer to speak of it as  triple fusion The disputed centrosolne question is touched upon and the authors views may perhaps be gained from the following quotation  To say that all the figures that have been drawn have been mere products of the imagination would be a radical statement and one doubtless very far rom the truth In the discussion of the en dosperm its morphological character is touched upon and while its exact nature is not con sidered established the view that it is  belated vegetative tissue of the female gametophyte stimulated in a general way to develop by the act of fertilization is held as the most probable although the possibility that it is a second sporophyte is admitted Partheno genesis and polyembryony are treated in the chapter on the embryo and recent investiga tions seem to indieate that both are much more common than was ormerly supposed In connection with each chapter there is a bibliography of the most important literature An idea of the number of original papers consulted may be gained from the literature cited in the ellapter on the female gameto phyte whiGh ineludes 122 separate artieles The masterly way in which the vast amount of ehaotie material has been handled is a commendable feature of the work and we are inelined to thKink that the authors of some of our standard tests might consult it with profit Several chapters are given on classifica tion and it is enepuraging to note that the authors have not found it necessary to develop a classification of their own but have been eontented to adopt the classification of iEngler and Prantl as given in  Die Naturlichen Pflanzenfamilien7 as the best expression of our present knowledge as applied to the whole of the Angiosperms The fact that  this has not been pressed to the dreary details of minor groups but that gelxeral principles have been emphasized makes these chapters of special vallle to the morphologist Separate chapters are given to geographic distribution fossil Angiosperms and phylogeny of Angiosperms The work closes with two chapters on the comparative anatomy of Gym nosperms and Angiosperms eontributed by Professor iE D Jefrey of Harvard Univer sity Only a brief outline of the subject is attempted and perhaps some students will feel that a more estended treatment would have been advisable The whole work is illustrated with some thing over a hundred figures taken in large part from the original artieles cited The book is an admirable presentation of the sub ject and should be in the hands of every work ing botanist F D IIEALD UNIVERS1TY OF NEBRASKA INVESTIGATIOA7S IN PROGRESS AT

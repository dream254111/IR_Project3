J100688,ABSTRACTS OF THE PAPERS PRINTED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,109681,ON PLATINA AND NATIVE PALLADIUM FROM BRAZIL ABSTRACT,I207043,330 THER BY LIGAMENT AND FORMING A TUBE COMMUNICATING FROM ONE EX TREMITY OF THE SPINE TO THE OTHER THIS SPECIES OF INTERVERTEBRAL JOINT WHICH THUS APPEARS COMMON TO THE FISH TRIBE IS NOT FOUND TO OBTAIN IN THE WHALES AS THEIR STRUCTURE IN THIS AS IN MANY OTHER RESPECTS IS THE SAME AS THAT OF QUADRUPEDS BUT IS MORE DISTINCTLY VISIBLE FROM THE VAST SIZE OF THE PARTS IN THEM THE INTERVERTEBRAL SUBSTANCE IS ARRANGED IN CONCENTRIC CIRCLES CON NECTED BY TRANSVERSE FIBRES THE EXTERNAL LAYERS BEING VERY FIRM AND COMPACT BUT THE INTERIOR BECOME SUCCESSIVELY SOFTER TILL IN THE CENTRE THERE IS A SOFT PLIANT SUBSTANCE MORE LIKE JELLY THAN AN ORGANIZED BODY CORRESPONDING IN ITS USE TO THE INCOMPRESSIBLE FLUID IN FISH IN THE BULLOCK SHEEP DEER MONKEY AND MAN THE STRUCTURE COR RESPONDS WITH THAT OF THE WHALE BUT IN THE HOG AND RABBIT A CAVITY WAS OBSERVED WITH A SMOOTH INTERNAL SURFACE EXTENDING THROUGLI HALF THE DIAMETER OF THE VERTEBRAE SO THAT THE STRUCTURE IN THESE ANIMALS IMITATES THAT OF FISHES THOUGH NOT FOR ANY OBVIOUS PURPOSE IN THE ALLIGATOR THE SEVERAL JOINTS ARE REGULARLY ARTICULATED WITH CAPSULAR LIGAMENTS AND ARE LUBRICATED WITH SYNOVIA IN THE SNAKE THERE IS A REGULAR BALL AND SOCKET JOINT BETWEEN EVERY TWO VERTEBRAE SO THAT THE MEANS EMPLOYED FOR THE MOTION OF THE BACKBONE IN DIF FERENT ANIMALS COMPREHENDS ALMOST EVERY SPECIES OF JOINT MR HOMES PAPER HAS ANNEXED TO IT AN APPENDIX BY MR WILLIAM BRANDE GIVING AN ACCOUNT OF THE CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF THE FLUID CON TAINED IN THE INTERVERTEBRAL CAVITY OF THE SQUALUS MAXIMUS ITS SPECIFIC GRAVITY WAS FOUND TO BE 1027 IT WAS NOT COAGULATED BY HEAT NO PRECIPITATION WAS OCCASIONED BY INFUSION OF GALLS OR OF CATECHU NOR WAS ANY CHANGE PRODUCED BY ALCOHOL BUT OXYMURIATE OF MERCURY MURIATE OF TIN NITRATE OF SILVER AND ACETATE OF LEAD THREW DOWN COPIOUS PRECIPITATES FROM THE EFFECT OF THESE REAGENTS IT APPEARS TO 1MR BRANDE THAT THE FLUID CONTAINS NEITHER GELATINE NOR ALBUMEN BUT WHEN THE FLUID WAS EVAPORATED TO HALF ITS BULK PELLICLES BEGAN TO FORM ON THE SUR FACE INDICATING THE PRESENCE OF A VARIETY OF ANIMAL MATTER WHICH THE AUTHOR CONSIDERS AS MUCUS OR MUCILAGE BUT WHICH UNDER CERTAIN CIR CUMSTANCES OF EVAPORATION IS CAPABLE OF BEING CONVERTED INTO A MO DIFICATION OF GELATINE OR ALBUMEN ON PLATINA AND NATIVE PALLADIUM FROM BRAZIL BY WILLIAM HYDE WOLLASTON MD SEC RS READ MARCH 22 1809 PHIL TRANS 1809 P 189 UNTIL A PORTION OF PLATINA WAS LATELY DISCOVERED BY M VAUQUELIN IN SOME SILVER ORES FROM ESTREMADURA THE WHOLE OF THE PLATINA KNOWN IN EUROPE WAS DERIVED FROM THE SPANISH POSSESSIONS IN SOUTH AME RICA AND HAD VERY UNIFORMLY THE SAME APPEARANCE DIFFERING SOLELY IN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE GRAINS A THIRD VARIETY HAVING LATELY BEEN RECEIVED FROM BRAZIL THE AUTHOR331 THOUGHT IT DESERVED PARTICULAR EXAMINATION ALTHOUGH THE QUANTITY WHICH HE COULD OBTAIN WAS TOO SMALL FOR ACCURATE ANALYSIS THE APPEARANCE OF THIS MINERAL IS WHITER THAN PERUVIAN PLATINA THE GRAINS ARE ROUGHER AND MORE ANGULAR BEING EVIDENTLY FRAGMENTS OF LARGER MASSES VERY LITTLE WORN AT THEIR SURFACES WHEN EXAMINED BY SOLUTION AND PRECIPITATION THE GREATEST PART OF THE GRAINS APPEARED TO BE PLATINA NEARLY PURE AS THEY ARE FREE FROM IRON WHICH FORMS A CONSIDERABLE PART OF THE PERUVIAN ORE AND APPARENTLY FREE FROM THE SEVERAL METALS WHICH HAVE WITHIN THESE FEW YEARS BEEN DISCOVERED IN THAT MINERAL BUT THEY CONTAIN ON THE CONTRARY A SMALL QUANTITY OF GOLD WHICH IS NOT CONTAINED IN THE GRAINS OF PERUVIAN PLATINA THE AUTHOR DISCOVERED ALSO AMONG THE GRAINS OF NATIVE PLATINA A FEW FRAGMENTS OF NATIVE PALLADIUM WHICH HE DESCRIBES AS RESEMBLING IN THE WHITENESS OF THEIR COLOUR THE GRAINS OF PLATINA BUT DIFFERING FROM THEM IN PRESENTING AN APPEARANCE OF FIBRES DIVERGING FROM ONE EXTREMITY THESE GRAINS ARE READILY DETECTED BY THEIR SOLUBILITY AND BY THE RED COLOUR OF THE SOLUTION THAT THEY CONSISTED OF PALLADIUM WAS PROVED BY PRECIPITATION WITH PRUSSIATE OF MERCURY OR GREEN SUL PHATE OF IRON AS WELL AS BY THEIR FUSIBILITY BY ASSISTANCE OF SULPHUR IT IS REMARKED HOWEVER THAT THESE GRAINS ARE NOT ABSOLUTELY PURE BUT CONTAIN A VERY SMALL QUANTITY OF PLATINA WHICH BY ITS REDNESS WHEN PRECIPITATED SEEMS TO BE CONTAMINATED BY IRIDIUM ON A NATIVE ARSENIATE OF LEAD BY THE REV WILLIAM GREGOR COM MUNICATED BY CHARLES HATCHETT ESQ FRS READAPRIL 13 1809 PHIL TRANS 1809 P 195 THE MINERAL OF WHICH THIS ACCOUNT IS GIVEN WAS RAISED IN A VERY RICH COPPERMINE CALLED HUELUNITY IN THE PARISH OF GWENNAP HAVING BEEN FOUND AT THE DEPTH OF FIFTY FATHOMS AT THE JUNCTION OF TWO SMALL LODES OR VEINS THIS ORE IS MIXED WITH SOME NATIVE COPPER VERY RICH GRAY COPPER AND BLACK COPPER ORE IT CRYSTALLIZES IN THE FORM OF A HEXAHEDRAL PRISM TERMINATED IN GENERAL BY A PLANE BUT SOMETIMES BY A TAPER SIXSIDED PYRAMID RHE COLOUR IS GENERALLY A SHADE OF YELLOW BUT SOMETIMES WINE YELLOW LIKE THE BRAZILIAN TOPAZ AND SOMETIMES AS DARK AS BROWN SUGARCANDY THE HARDNESS VARIES AND IS SOMETIMES SUFFICIENT TO SCRATCH FLINTGLASS THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY AT 500 TEMPERATURE IS 641 BEING EXPOSED TO HEAT UPON A GOLD SPOON IT MELTS INTO A BROWNISH YELLOW MASS AND REMAINS UNALTERED IN A STATE OF IGNITION BUT IF HEATED UPON CHARCOAL IT IS RAPIDLY DECOMPOSED ARSENICAL VAPOURS BEING EXTRICATED WHILE THE LEAD IS REDUCED TO ITS METALLIC STATE THE MODE OF ANALYSIS ADOPTED BY THE AUTHOR CONSISTED IN REDUCING THE ORE TO A FINE POWDER AND DECOMPOSING IT BY A SOLUTION OF PURE POTASH WITH DUE PRECAUTION TO AVOID THE SOLUTION OF LEAD BY THE ALKALI ALONG WITH THE ARSENIC ACID THE ARSENIATE OF POTASH WAS DE COMPOSED BY NITRATE OF LEAD WHICH GAVE AN ARSENIATE OF LEAD CON SISTING OF KNOWN PROPORTIONS FROM WHICH THE QUANTITY OF ARSENIC ACID IN THE ORE WAS FOUND TO BE 264 PER CENT

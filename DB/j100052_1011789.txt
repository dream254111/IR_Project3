CUZCO CUZCO PERU THERE CAN BE LITTLE DOUBT THAT THE GREATEST PROBLEM CONFRONTING PERU TODAY IS THE ORGANIZATION AND EXTENSION OF PUBLIC INSTRUC TION1 THE COUNTRY IS IN A FAIR WAY TOWARDS SETTLING ITS BOUNDARY CONTROVERSIES WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF THE TACNA AND ARICA QUESTION PENDING WITH CHILE HENCE THE BOUNDARIES NEED NO LONGER BE THE CENTRAL THEME OF DISCUSSION AND AGITATION BY THE LARGE MAJORITY OF PERUVIAN CITIZENS AS A BACKGROUND FOR THE DISCUSSION OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROBLEM IN PERU IT SEEMS EXPEDIENT TO STATE BRIEFLY SOME OF THE OBSTACLES WHICH IMPEDE RAPID PROGRESS TO THE BEST INTERESTS OF EDUCATION IN THE FIRST PLACE THE PHYSIOGRAPHY OF THE COUNTRY MERITS CONSIDERATION WITH AN AREA APPROXIMATELY ONE AND A HALF MILLION SQUARE KILOMETERS AND A COUNTRY PRACTICALLY DIVIDED INTO THREE MORE OR LESS INDE PENDENT SECTIONS PERU IS SEVERELY HANDICAPPED IN CARRYING ON THE FUNCTIONS OF GOVERNMENT THE COASTAL REGION EXTENDS ALONG THE WESTERN PART OF THE REPUBLIC IN A STRIP AVERAGING LESS THAN A HUN DRED MILES IN WIDTH IT IS GENERALLY DEVOID OF RAINFALL THE YEAR ROUND IT OCCUPIES ABOUT TEN PER CENT OF THE AREA OF THE REPUBLIC THE SIERRA OR MOUNTAINOUS REGION LIES TO THE EASTWARD AND IS THE SEAT OF THE PLATEAUS AND HIGH PEAKS OF THE ANDES ROUGHLY SPEAK ING IT OCCUPIES ABOUT TWENTYFIVE PER CENT OF THE AREA OF THE REPUB LIC THE MOUNTAINS ARE LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CLIMATIC CONDI TIONS OF THE COUNTRY STILL FARTHER TO THE EAST IS AN IMMENSE TRACT OF LAND EXCEEDINGLY RICH IN FLORA AND FAUNA IT OCCUPIES ALMOST TWO THIRDS OF THE AREA OF THE COUNTRY AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF TWO OR THREE SMALL DISTRICTS IS PRACTICALLY UNKNOWN LOCATED IN THE UPPER REGIONS OF THE AMAZON BASIN IT IS A LAND OF PRESENT SURPRISES AND OF GREAT PROMISE FOR THE FUTURE AT PRESENT IT IS SPARSELY SET TLED AND INDEED INHABITED IN PART BY AN UNCIVILIZED RACE I HEREBY DESIRE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE COURTESY OF SEVERAL PERSONS WHO HAVE SO KINDLY SUPPLIED ME WITH THE NECESSARY DATA ALL OF WHICH IS OF AN OFFICIAL CHARACTER I REFER TO DR MATIAS LEON EXMINISTER OF INSTRUCTION DR H E BARD ADVISER TO THE MINISTER OF INSTRUCTION DR JUSTUS PEREZ FIGUEROLA DIRECTORGENERAL OF INSTRUC TION MR AURELIO GAMARRA Y HERNANDEZ CHIEF OF THE BUREAU OF SECONDARY AND HIGHER EDUCATION AND DR VINCENTE DELAGADO CHIEF STATISTICIAN OF THE DEPARTMENT OF INSTRUCTION 663THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY THE SECOND OBSTACLE TO THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF A RATIONAL EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM MAY BE CONSIDERED UNDER THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION OF THE COUNTRY AS IN THE UNITED STATES THERE IS A GREAT MIXTURE OF RACES THE MAIN DISTINCTION IN A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES HOWEVER LIES IN THE FACT THAT IN THE FORMER COUNTRY THE WHITE ELEMENT PREDOMINATES NUMERICALLY CONSIDERED WHEREAS IN THE LATTER THE INDIAN OR CHOLO ELEMENT I E THE DESCENDANTS OF THE INCAS COMES FIRST MOST OF THE WHITE AND MESTIZO OR MIXED WHITE AND RED BLOOD IS FOUND ALONG THE COAST IT IS THE CENTER OF INFLUENCE OF THE SPANIARD THE OTHER TWO REGIONS ARE SETTLED CHIEFLY BY THE MESTIZO ELEMENT THE NEGRO ELEMENT IS ALSO PRESENT AND IS CONCENTRATED CHIEFLY IN THE COASTAL REGION ALLOWING FOR EXCEPTIONS THERE IS NATURALLY A DIFFERENCE IN THE INTELLECTUAL CAPACITIES OF THESE RACE MIXTURES THIS DIFFERENCE COMES OUT MORE CLEARLY IN AN IN VESTIGATION OF THE LOCATION AND WORK OF SECONDARY AND HIGHER INSTI TUTIONS OF LEARNING WHICH ARE CONCENTRATED CHIEFLY IN THE COASTAL REGION YET THIS REGION HAS ONLY ABOUT TWENTYFIVE PER CENT OF THE THREE AND A HALF MILLION INHABITANTS OF THE COUNTRY MORE MIGHT BE ADDED WITH REFERENCE TO THE INFLUENCE OF CLIMATE RACIAL ASSIMILATION AND THE EFFECTS OF SPANISH COLONIZATION UPON THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BUT NONE OF THESE PRESENTS INSURMOUNTABLE OBSTACLES TO THE ADVANCE MENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION POLITICAL DRAWBACKS ALSO EXIST AND THEY ARE MOST IN EVIDENCE IN AFFECTING THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF THE COUNTRY PERU HAS A CABINET OR MINISTERIAL FORM OF GOVERNMENTAS IN FRANCE THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE INSTRUCTION AND RELIGION WHO IS ONE OF THE SIX MINISTERS OF STATE HAS CHARGE OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION UNDER THE MINISTER IS A DIRECTORGENERAL OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTIONA POSITION WHICH WAS CREATED LAST JANUARY2 THE DIRECTORGENERAL THEREFORE HAS ALL THE ADMINISTRATIVE WORK OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IN HIS HANDS UNDER HIM ARE THE FOLLOWING CHIEFS AT THE HEAD OF THEIR RESPECTIVE BUREAUS THESE INCLUDE THE CHIEF OF SECONDARY AND HIGHER EDUCATION OF THE PERSONNEL AND GENERAL ADMINISTRATION AN IMPORT ANT POST UNDER THE PRESENT ORGANIZATION OF EQUIPMENT AND SUP PLIES OF STATISTICS AND ARCHIVES ASIDE FROM THESE BUREAUS UNDER PREVIOUSLY THERE WAS A DIRECTORGENERAL OF JUSTICE PUBLIC INSTRUCTION AND RELIGION BUT BY DECREE THAT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED SEPARATELY LEGALLY THE WORK OF SECONDARY AND HIGHER EDUCATION WAS LEFT IN THE HANDS OF THIS DIRECTOR AND PRIMARY EDUCATION IN THE HANDS OF ANOTHER DIRECTOR 664 86PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IN PERU 87 THE DIRECTORGENERAL THE MINISTER HAS AN EXPERT ADVISER IN MATTERS APPERTAINING TO EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION CONCERNING THE PRESENT ORGANIZATION IT WOULD SEEM HIGHLY DESIRABLE TO MAKE THE WORK OF ALL OF THESE OFFICIALS FREE FROM POLITICAL INFLUENCE EXCEPT THAT OF THE MINISTER THERE IS ALSO A SUPERIOR COUNCIL OF EDUCATION BUT IT HAS HAD A RATHER CHECKERED CAREER IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT THERE BE A SEPARATE MINISTER FOR EDUCATION BUT THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO THIS QUESTION3 THE CONSTITUTION OF PERU GUARANTEES THE EXISTENCE AND DIFFU SION OF PRIMARY INSTRUCTION WHICH SHALL BE FREE AND OBLIGATORY4 THE PRESENT LAW OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION PRIMARY SECOND AND HIGHER INSTRUCTION WAS PASSED BY CONGRESS IN I9OI THE PORTION DEALING WITH PRIMARY INSTRUCTION WAS REMODELED IN DECEMBER I905 UPON THESE TWO LAWS ARE BASED NUMEROUS EXECUTIVE DECREES AMPLIFYING THE SYSTEM OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION PRIMARY INSTRUCTION ELEMENTARY EDUCATION IS OBLIGATORY FOR BOYS BETWEEN THE AGES OF SIX AND FOURTEEN AND FOR GIRLS BETWEEN THE AGES OF SIX AND TWELVE PRIMARY SCHOOLS ARE OF TWO CLASSES I ELEMENTARY 2 CENTROS IT WILL BE NOTED THAT PERU HAS BEEN SECURING FOR SOME YEARS FROM TIME TO TIME FROM GERMANY BELGIUM SWITZERLAND AND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TEACHERS FOR THE NATIONAL COLEGIOS THE DUTIES OF THESE TEACHERS HAVE BEEN CONFINED ENTIRELY TO TEACHING IN THESE SCHOOLS OR IN A FEW INSTANCES TO DIRECTING THEM IT WAS ONLY A YEAR AGO THAT IT WAS REALIZED THERE WAS NEED OF WELLTRAINED AND EXPERIENCED MEN IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE BRANCH OF EDUCATION DR MANUEL V VILLARAN WHO HAD MADE A THOROUGH STUDY OF THE EDUCATIONAL SITUATION REVISTA UNIVERSITARIA AFIO III VOL II NO 23 PP 121 AND NO 24 PP 105130 SEPT AND OCT 1908 UPON BEING CALLED TO THE CABINET WITH THE PORTFOLIO OF JUSTICE INSTRUCTION AND RELIGION DECIDED TO ENGAGE FROM THE STATES A DIRECTOR GENERAL AND FOUR DEPARTMENTAL INSTRUCTORS OF PRIMARY INSTRUCTION AND A DIRECTOR AND NUMBER OF SPECIAL TEACHERS FOR THE NATIONAL COLEGIOS AND FOR NORMAL INSTRUCTION DR VILLARANS PLANS WERE ONLY PARTIALLY CARRIED OUT WHEN A CHANGE OF CABINET BROUGHT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INSTRUCTION A NEW MINISTER WHO DID NOT FIND HIMSELF ENTIRELY IN SYMPATHY WITH THE PLANS OF HIS PREDECESSOR BEFORE THIS TIME HOWEVER FOUR OF THESE MEN WERE ON THEIR WAY TO PERU THEY WERE MEN ESPECIALLY PRE PARED BY PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE AS WELL AS BY LARGE ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL TRAINING FOR THE WORK THEY WERE TO DO THEY ARE NOW RENDERING IMPORTANT SERVICE OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE CHARACTER THE FULL VALUE OF WHICH WILL RECEIVE RECOGNITION ONLY IN TIME DR H E BARD WHO IS ADVISER TO THE MINISTER OF INSTRUCTION HAD FOR SOME YEARS BEFORE COMING TO PERU GIVEN SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES AND PARTICULARLY TO THE SCIENCE OF EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION HE HAD HAD VALUABLE PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE ALSO IN THIS FIELD IN THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS SOME FARREACHING REFORMS HAVE ALREADY BEEN EFFECTED THROUGH HIS INITIATIVE IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE WORK OF THESE MEN WILL DEMONSTRATE THE NEED OF OTHERS LIKE THEM AND IN THIS WAY WILL ONE OF PERUS GREATEST EDUCATIONAL NEEDS BE MET 4ARTICLE 24 SEE CONSTITUTION OF LATINAMERICAN REPUBLICS PUBLISHED BY THE INTERNATIONAL UNION OF AMERICAN REPUBLICS 665ESCOLARES OR LITERARY SCHOOL CENTERS KINDERGARTEN SCHOOLS ARE ALSO PROVIDED IN TWO OR THREE INSTANCES THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS TAKE UP THE STUDIES OF THE FIRST TWO YEARS

PREVIOUSLY THERE WERE OVER ONE HUNDRED SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN EACH OF THESE DISTRICTS IS AN INSPECTOR WHO SEES THAT THE SCHOOL REGULATIONS OF THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT ARE CARRIED INTO EFFECT THERE IS AN EXCEPTION IN THE CASE OF LIMA AND CALLAO WHERE TWO INSPECTORS ARE PROVIDED ONE FOR BOYS SCHOOLS THE OTHER FOR GIRLS AND MIXED SCHOOLS5 IN THE PAST THE INSPECTORS HAVE NOT ALWAYS PROVED EFFICIENT VISITING THE SCHOOLS INFREQUENTLY AND KNOWING OR CARING LITTLE ABOUT THE REQUIREMENTS OF THEIR POSITION CONSEQUENTLY THERE HAS BEEN A RECENT DECREE PROVIDING QUALIFICATIONS WHICH MAY RESULT IN A BETTER SYSTEM OF INSPECTION THE NEW DECREE HOWEVER HAS ONE SERIOUS DEFECT IN THAT IT REQUIRES THE INSPECTOR TO TELEGRAPH THE FACT OF HIS INTENDED VISIT TO THE DIRECTORGENERAL IN LIMA AND TO THE SUBPREFECT OF THE PROVINCE WHICH HE EXPECTS TO VISIT BY THIS MEANS THE SCHOOL AUTHORITIES MAY SECURE ADVANCE NOTICE AND BE PREPARED AN IN SPECTOR WILL NOW BE REQUIRED TO HAVE I A DEGREE BACHELOR OR DIPLOMAS FROM THE NORMAL SCHOOL 2 THE INSPECTORS NOW IN OFFICE MUST TAKE AN EXAMINATION WITHIN NINETY DAYS TO PROVE THEIR COMPE TENCE OTHERWISE NEW INSPECTORS ARE TO BE APPOINTED6 FURTHERMORE THE

SIXTY PER CENT WITH THE PUPILS IN PRIVATE SCHOOLS LESS THAN ONEFIFTH OF A MILLION OF CHILDREN WERE RECEIVING PRIMARY EDUCATION THROUGHOUT THE REPUBLIC7 THIS APPEARS TO BE A SMALL PROPORTION FOR A

RACIAL PROBLEM TO SETTLE FROM THE EDUCATIONAL POINT OF VIEW JUST AS WE HAVE IN THE UNITED STATES IT WOULD SEEM PLAUSIBLE THAT THE INTRODUCTION OF AMERICAN TEACHERS AND AMERICAN METHODS FROM SECTIONS WHERE THE EDUCATION OF MIXED RACES IS PROMINENT SHOULD BE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF PERUL THE TEACHERS IN THE PRIMARY SCHOOLS ARE WOMEN IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES ALTHOUGH SUPPOSED TO HAVE A DIPLOMA THE MAJORITY OF TEACHERS ARE NOT SO PROVIDEDL2 THUS OUT OF 2944 TEACHERS 1225 MEN 1719 WOMEN TWOTHIRDS DID NOT POSSESS A DIPLOMA AT PRESENT THERE ARE THREE NORMAL SCHOOLSONE FOR MEN AND TWO FOR WOMEN TWO ARE LOCATED IN LIMA AND A COMPARATIVELY SMALLER ONE FOR WOMEN IN AREQUIPA PREVIOUSLY THERE WERE MORE BUT FINANCIAL AND OTHER DIFFICULTIES HAVE CAUSED THE CLOSING OF THE OTHERS THE

APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION FORM ONLY A PART OF THE REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES WHICH HE CONTROLS NEVERTHELESS TO INSURE AT LEAST A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF REVENUE WHICH WOULD NOT DEPEND ENTIRELY UPON THE ACTION OF CONGRESS A LAW WAS PASSED PROVIDING SPECIAL SOURCES OF INCOME ALL TOLD THE REVENUES FOR PRIMARY INSTRUCTION ARE DERIVED FROM THE FOLLOWING SOURCES A A SPECIAL TAX OR MOJONAZGO ON ALCOHOLIC DRINKS AND MINERAL WATER INSOFAR AS MONEY FROM THIS SOURCE DOES NOT FURNISH MORE THAN FIFTY PER CENT OF THE TOTAL REVENUE OF ANY MUNICIPALITY B LOCAL TAXES CREATED BY SPECIAL ACTS OF CONGRESS C SPECIAL FUNDS AND REVENUES FROM PROPERTY D THIRTY PER CENT OF THE DEPARTMENTAL REVENUES DEDUCTING FROM THIS THE SUBVENTIONS ASSIGNED TO SECONDARY INSTRUC TION ON THE BASIS OF THE

PRIMARY EDUCATION AS LATE AS I860 DR FRANCISCO CALDERON IN HIS EXCELLENT DICCIONARIO DE LA LEGISLACION PERUANA STATED THAT THE COUNTRY STILL FELT THE LAMENTABLE CONSEQUENCES OF THE REPRESSIVE SYSTEM OF EDUCA TION WHICH HAD BEEN PROVIDED BY THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT DURING THE COLONIAL PERIOD15 ALTHOUGH MOST OF THESE CONSEQUENCES HAVE DISAPPEARED TODAY SOME STILL REMAIN A TEMPORARY DECREE BEARING ON PUBLIC INSTRUCTION HAD BEEN PROMULGATED IN I855THE FIRST GENE RAL DECREE UP TO THAT TIME IT REMAINED IN FORCE UNTIL 1876 ALTHOUGH ATTEMPTS HAD BEEN MADE IN THE MEANWHILE TO CHANGE IT BY THE LATTER DECREE ISSUED MARCH I9 THE SYSTEM OF PUBLIC INSTRUC TION WAS DECENTRALIZED ESPECIALLY AS REGARDS PRIMARY INSTRUCTION THE DEPARTMENTAL AUTHORITIES WERE INTRUSTED WITH SECONDARY THE MUNICIPAL COUNCILS WITH PRIMARY EDUCATION I E SO FAR AS THE FINAN CIAL POWERS WERE CONCERNED THE DIRECTIVE BODY WAS A SUPERIOR COUNCIL OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IT SOON BECAME EVIDENT THAT THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES DID NOT OR WOULD NOT PROVIDE SUITABLE FUNDS AND MAT TERS WENT FROM BAD TO WORSE UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES CONGRESS ENACTED A LAW IN I9GO CENTRALIZING THE ADMINISTRATION TO A LARGE EX TENTA WORK WHICH HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT MORE THOROUGHLY BY THE ACT OF I905 FOR THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT WAS GIVEN FULL CONTROL OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION16 THE MAJORITY OF THE REPORTS OF THE MINISTERS OF INSTRUCTION THROUGHOUT THIS PERIOD ASIDE FROM THE QUESTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE CENTRALIZATION EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF PRIMARY EDUCATION YET ALMOST INVARIABLY THESE SAME REPORTS STATE THAT PRIMARY EDUCA TION WAS IN A CONDITION FAR FROM SATISFACTORY THE COMPLAINTS USUALLY TAKE THE FORM OF LACK OF MONEY LACK OF SCHOOLS AND EQUIP MENT DEARTH OF SUITABLE TEACHERS AND THE NEED OF BETTER SALARIES AND MORE PUNCTUAL PAYMENT OF TEACHERS THUS IN HIS REPORT FOR 1893 THE MINISTER OF INSTRUCTION PLEADS FOR A BROADER BASIS OF PRIM ARY EDUCATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONSTITUTION AND COMPLAINS OF THE COMPARATIVELY LARGE SUM SPENT

EDUCATION WHEN THE MAJORITY OF THE CHILDREN OF THE COUNTRY DID NOT EVEN KNOW HOW TO READ OR WRITE WHEN MANY OF THE PROVINCES DID NOT HAVE TEACHERS NOR SCHOOL BUILDINGS NOR ANY INCOME FOR THE MOST INDISPENSABLE EQUIPMENT HE BLAMED THESE CONDITIONS LARGELY UPON THE DECENTRALIZED SYSTEM OF ADMINISTRATION17 UNFORTUNATELY THE DEFECTS WHICH EXISTED UNDER THE DECENTRALIZED SYSTEM OF ADMINISTRA TION HAVE BY NO MEANS DISAPPEARED WITH SEVERAL EXCEPTIONS THEY ARE JUST AS GLARING AS BEFORE THE MAIN DEFECTS LIE IN THE ADMINISTRA TION ITSELF AND THE LACK OF SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO CARRY OUT A PROGRESSIVE PROGRAM OF REFORMS THE ADMINISTRATIVE MACHINERY NEEDS REMODEL ING BUT SHOULD UNDOUBTEDLY REMAIN CENTRALIZED THE FINANCIAL PROB LEM IS CONSIDERED VERY SERIOUS AT PRESENT BUT EVEN HERE THERE IS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THE EXPENDITURE OF THE MONEY VOTED BY CONGRESS FOR SCHOOLS THE STATE COULD REALLY SPEND PROFITABLY FIVE TIMES THE SUM VOTED FOR THIS YEAR IT WOULD THEN BE IN A MUCH BET TER POSITION TO CARRY OUT THE PROVISION OF THE CONSTITUTION PROVIDING OBLIGATORY PRIMARY EDUCATION THIS APPLIES WITH ADDED FORCE TO THE EDUCATION OF GIRLS BY PUBLIC AUTHORITY AS ONE PROMINENT PERUVIAN WRITER PUTS IT SO LONG AS THE INTELLECTUAL AND SOCIAL LEVEL OF THE FAMILY IS NOT RAISED BY THE EDUCATION OF THE MOTHER OUR PEOPLE WILL FORGE AHEAD VERY SLOWLY THAT TASK THE REALIZATION OF WHICH IS OF NATIONAL IMPORT

WAS INTENDED TO PROVIDE INSTRUCTION ADAPTED TO AGRICULTURE COMMERCIAL EDUCATION AND MINING AND MECHANICAL ARTS IN ORDER THAT PUPILS MIGHT ACQUIRE THE KNOWLEDGE INDISPENSABLE FOR DEDICATING THEMSELVES

A SECRETARY THE PROFESSORS INSPECTORS AND THE OFFICE PERSONNEL THE DIRECTOR IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE RECEIVED A UNIVERSITY DEGREE BUT THIS PROVISION IS NOT ALWAYS ENFORCED HE IS EXPECTED TO RESIDE IN THE

THE CALLING OF FACULTY MEETINGS AND FOR THE ANNUAL REPORT SHOWING CERTAIN DETAILS WITH REFERENCE TO MATRICULATION AND EXAMINATION OF STUDENTS EQUIPMENT ETC THE SUBDIRECTOR HAS TO DO MORE DIRECTLY WITH

COLEGIOS IS PRESUMABLY FROM THIRTEEN TO SEVENTEEN THE FORMER DECREE RQUIRED THE PUPILS TO HAVE COMPLETED THE TWELFTH YEAR BUT IN PRACTICE THIS HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN INSISTED UPON THE NEW DECREE REQUIRES PUPILS OF THE FIRST YEAR TO BE BETWEEN THE AGES OF TWELVE AND FIFTEEN ADMISSION TO THE COLEGIO MAY BE BY EXAMINATION OR UPON SATISFACTORY COMPLE TION OF PRIMARY INSTRUCTION THE LATTER METHOD PREVAILS ALMOST ENTIRELY THERE WERE TWENTYEIGHT NATIONAL COLEGIOS IN PERU IN I908 WITH A TOTAL OF 3289 PUPILS THE LARGEST AND MOST IMPORTANT BY FAR IS GUADALUPE COLEGIO IN LIMA WITH OVER FIVE HUNDRED PUPILS IN FACT THIS COLEGIO SERVES AS THE MODEL FOR THE OTHERS AND HAS A BUILDING COSTING ALL TOLD ABOUT HALF A MILLION DOLLARS IN I904 THERE WERE TWENTYTHREE COLEGIOS WITH A TOTAL OF 204I PUPILS ONLY THREE OF THE NATIONAL COLEGIOS ARE FOR GIRLS WITH A TOTAL OF ABOUT 200 PUPILS THESE THREE COLEGIOS ARE LOCATED IN CUZCO AYACUCHO AND TRUJILLO SUPPLEMENTING THE NATIONAL COLEGIOS ARE THE PRIVATE COLE GIOS LOCATED CHIEFLY IN CUZCO AND LIMA AND DIRECTED BY THE CHURCH OR AS BUSINESS VENTURES THESE PRIVATE COLEGIOS NUMBERED THIRTY FOUR IN I908 OF WHICH TWENTY WERE FOR BOYS AND FOURTEEN FOR GIRLS THE NUMBER OF BOYS WHO ATTENDED TOTALED IOI6 OF GIRLS 275 THE LAW PROVIDES THAT PUPILS MAY BOARD IN THE COLEGIO THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SUCH PUPILS IS DETERMINED BY THE SUPERIOR COUNCIL OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION ACCORDING TO THE LAW BUT NOT IN PRAC TICE MANY PUPILS BOTH IN NATIONAL AND PRIVATE COLEGIOS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS PROVISION OF THE LAW THE EXPENSE OF A PUPIL IN GUADALUPE COLEGIO MAY BE TAKEN AS REPRESENTATIVE THE CHARGES HERE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING MATRICULA TION FEE I FOR ANNUAL EXAMINATIONS 2 TUITION 20 PER YEAR FOR PUPILS IN THE PRIMARY GRADES WHICH HAPPEN TO BE GIVEN IN THIS COLEGIO AND FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF SECONDARY INSTRUCTION AND 30 FOR THE 676 98PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IN PERU LAST TWO YEARS OF SECONDARY INSTRUCTION BOARD AND LODGING FOR THE YEAR I05 FEES FOR THE USE OF EQUIPMENT 3 ALTHOUGH THIRD AND FOURTHYEAR STUDENTS PAY 250 ADDITIONAL FOR THE USE OF THE LABORA TORIES LAUNDRY CHARGES FOR THOSE WHO CARE TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THE OPPORTUNITY AMOUNT TO I50 PER MONTH IN IGOG GUADALUPE COLEGIO PROVIDED BOARD AND LODGING FOR 175 PUPILS AND IN ADDITION BOARD FOR OVER 200 ADDITIONAL PUPILS THIS YEAR THE NUMBER WAS ALMOST DOUBLED OWING TO EXTENSIONS AND IMPROVEMENT TO THE BUILDING STILL UNDER WAY PRACTICALLY EACH DEPARTMENT GIVES SCHOLARSHIPS TO A LIMITED NUMBER OF PUPILS MANY OF WHOM ARE SENT TO GUADALUPE COLEGIO SUCH A SCHOLARSHIP PROVIDES ALL TUITION AND LIVING EXPENSES THE STUDENTS ARE NOT ACCUSTOMED AS A GENERAL RULE TO DO MUCH IF ANY SCHOOL WORK AT HOME SCHOOL HOURS ARE FROM 8 TO II IN THE MORNING AND I TO 5 IN THE AFTERNOON SIX DAYS PER WEEK AS THE CURRICULUM PROVIDES LESS THAN THIRTY HOURS OF CLASSROOM WORK THE OTHER HOURS ARE UTILIZED FOR STUDY PHYSICAL TRAINING AND MILITARY DRILL IRREGULARITY OF ATTENDANCE ON THE PART OF PUPILS AND EVEN OF PROFESSORS IS ONE OF THE MARKED DEFECTS OF ADMINISTRATION WHICH MERITS RIGOROUS CORRECTIVE MEASURES EXAMINATIONS AND PRIZES MENTION MUST BE MADE OF THE SYSTEM OF PRIZES EXISTING IN ALL BRANCHES OF EDUCATIONPUBLIC AS WELL AS PRIVATE MEDALS BOOKS AND OTHER USEFUL OBJECTS ARE DISTRIBUTED FOR THE MERITORIOUS AT THE CLOSE OF THE SCHOOL YEAR THE ANNUAL EXERCISES CORRESPOND TO OUR HIGH SCHOOL COMMENCEMENT ONLY HERE THE EXERCISES COME AT THE CLOSE OF THE YEAR THE PREFECT OF THE DEPARTMENT OR IN LIMA THE MINISTER OF INSTRUCTION AND PERHAPS EVEN THE PRESIDENT AND OTHER SCHOOL AUTHORITIES ATTEND THE EXERCISES AT THE NATIONAL COLEGIO THE SYSTEM OF EXAMINATIONS IS WORTHY OF SPECIAL ATTENTION AT THE CLOSE OF EACH OF THE FOUR YEARS THERE IS AN EXAMINATION IN EACH SUBJECT IN THE OFFICIAL PROGRAM OF STUDIES THE TERM WORK COUNTS ONETHIRD OF THE GENERAL AVERAGE THE WRITTEN EXAMINATION USUALLY LASTING LESS THAN ONE HOUR COUNTS ONETHIRD AND THE ORAL EXAMI NATION USUALLY FIVE TO TEN MINUTES FOR EACH PUPIL THE OTHER THIRD FOR NATIONAL COLEGIOS SPECIAL EXAMINING BOARDS OF THREE MEMBERS EACH ARE APPOINTED BY THE DIRECTOR THE PROFESSOR OF THE CLASS 677 99THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY ACTS AS PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD FOR PRIVATE COLEGIOS WHOSE PUPILS DESIRE TO PRESENT THEMSELVES FOR THE EXAMINATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE OFFICIAL PROGRAM THREE SPECIAL EXAMINING BOARDS ARE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR LIMA THEY ARE APPOINTED BY THE MINISTER FOR THE DEPARTMENTS BY THE PREFECTS THESE BOARDS EXAMINE IN LET TERS SCIENCES AND LANGUAGES RESPECTIVELY IT WAS MY PRIVILEGE TO ACT AS PRESIDENT OF THE LAST MENTIONED BOARD FOR LIMA DURING I909 THE EXAMINING BOARDS FOR PRIVATE COLEGIOS RECEIVE A FEE FOR EVERY STUDENT WHO IS EXAMINED REGARDLESS OF WHETHER HE PRESENTS HIMSELF OR WHETHER HE PASSES THE EXAMINATION FOR NATIONAL COL EGIOS ONE COPY OF THE MARKS IS SENT TO THE MINISTER OF INSTRUCTION FOR PRIVATE COLEGIOS ONE IS SENT TO THE MINISTER ONE IS LEFT IN THE COLEGIO ITSELF AND THE THIRD IS SENT TO THE NATIONAL COLEGIO OF THE DEPARTMENT IN WHICH THE PRIVATE COLEGIO IS LOCATED THE EXAMINING BOARDS FOR PRIVATE COLEGIOS ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO PREPARE A REPORT FOR THE MINISTER RELATIVE TO THE PEDAGOGICAL CONDITIONS EXISTING IN EACH COLEGIO WHICH HAS BEEN VISITED THIS BOARD CAN ONLY EXAMINE IN THE COLEGIOS WHICH HAVE PREVIOUSLY SENT TO THE MINISTER A REQUEST FOR SUCH EXAMINATION INCLUDING IN THIS REQUEST THE LIST OF STUDENTS WHO ARE TO BE EXAMINED PRACTICALLY ALL PRIVATE COLEGIOS DO THIS A METHOD OF EXAMINATION SOMEWHAT SIMILAR PREVAILS IN THE UNIVERSI TIES THE SYSTEM IS NOT ONLY CUMBERSOME AND TIMECONSUMING BUT IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AT LEAST IT IS SUBJECT TO LOGROLLING METHODS MOREOVER THE ACTUAL EXAMINATIONSORAL AND WRITTENNEED MODI FICATION EVEN MORE SERIOUS DEFECTS MIGHT BE NOTED AS REGARDS THE EXAMINATIONS FOR PRIVATE COLEGIOS A COMPETENT NATIONAL EXAM INING BOARD OR PERHAPS EVEN SEVERAL DEPARTMENTAL BOARDS SHOULD PROVIDE UNIFORM EXAMINATIONS BASED ON THE OFFICIAL CURRICULUM INCOME AND EXPENDITURES THE INCOME OF NATIONAL COLEGIOS CONSISTS I OF THE SUM VOTED BY CONGRESS 2 ANY SUM VOTED BY THE DEPARTMENT 3 SPECIAL IN COME ASSIGNED TO A COLEGIO 4 FEES OF STUDENTS 5 RENT FROM PROPERTY OWNED BY THE SCHOOLUSUALLY INSIGNIFICANT THE BUDGET OF EACH COLEGIO IS MADE UP TOWARD THE CLOSE OF THE SCHOOL YEAR BY AN ECONOMIC COUNCIL THIS COUNCIL CONSISTS OF THE DIRECTOR THE TREAS URER A PROFESSOR OF THE COLEGIO AND TWO FATHERS WHOSE SONS ARE ATTENDING THE SCHOOL THE COUNCIL MEETS SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE 678 IOOPUBLIC INSTRUCTION IN PERU YEAR TO CONSIDER FINANCIAL MATTERS OF THE COLEGIO AND TOWARDS THIS END IT IS GENERALLY CONVENED BY THE DIRECTOR FOR THE TWENTYEIGHT COLEGIOS IN I908 THE TOTAL INCOME AMOUNTED TO 3IOOOO ABOUT TWENTYFIVE PER CENT OF WHICH CAME FROM TUITION FEES IT WAS SPENT IN LARGE PART FOR SALARIES A SMALLER SUM WAS SPENT FOR MAINTENANCE OF THE SCHOOL BUILDINGS EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES ON THE WHOLE THERE SHOULD BE MORE MONEY APPRO PRIATED FOR SECONDARY EDUCATION ALTHOUGH IT SHOULD AT THE SAME TIME CONSTITUTE A SMALLER PROPORTION OF THE TOTAL SPENT ON PUBLIC INSTRUC TION THAN IS THE CASE AT PRESENT THE OBJECTS TOWARDS WHICH THIS INCREASE COULD BE DEVOTED ADVANTAGEOUSLY INCLUDE I ADEQUATE BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT 2 PAY OF PROFESSORS 3 EXTENSION OF COMMERCIAL EDUCATION IN VARIOUS NATIONAL COLEGIOS THERE IS NEED FOR GREATER ELASTICITY IN THE COURSES OPEN TO STU DENTS IN THE COLEGIO THE LAW OF 190O IN PROVIDING THE LICEOS SOUGHT TO ATTAIN THIS END THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COUNTRY HOWEVER DOES NOT JUSTIFY SEPARATE SCHOOLS SEPARATE DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THE COLEGIO SHOULD BE PROVIDED ALONG THE LINES OF THE ORGANI ZATION IN OUR HIGH SCHOOLS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COMMERCIAL DEPARTMENT IN THE LEADING COLEGIO OF THE COUNTRY IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AFTER THE ADOPTION OF A WELLCONSIDERED PLAN PROVIDING SEPARATE DEPARTMENTS FOR THE COLEGIO THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD MAKE AN EARNEST EFFORT TO ENCOURAGE A LARGER PROPORTION OF THE STUDENTS TO ATTEND THE NATIONAL COLEGIOS THAN IS THE CASE AT PRESENT AS IT IS THE NATIONAL COLEGIO IS SUPERIOR TO THE PRIVATE COLEGIO FROM ALMOST EVERY POINT OF VIEW AND YET FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER ABOUT FORTY PER CENT OF THE TOTAL NUM BER OF STUDENTS ARE ATTENDING PRIVATE COLEGIOS IT IS A FACT OF SOME SIGNIFICANCE THAT THERE IS NO NATIONAL COLEGIO FOR GIRLS IN LIMA AND THAT THERE ARE ONLY THREE IN THE COUNTRY HIGHER EDUCATION THE UNIVERSITIES OF PERU INCLUDE THE UNIVERSITY OF ST MARK IN LIMA FOUNDED I571 BY PIUS X AND ROYAL DECREE OF PHILIP II AND THE MINOR UNIVERSITIES OF CUZCO AREQUIPA AND TRUJILLO THESE WERE ESTABLISHED IN I692 I835 AND 1824 RESPECTIVELY THE UNIVER SITY OF CUZCO WAS CLOSED TEMPORARILY LAST YEAR OWING TO CERTAIN IRREGULARITIES THE OCCASION GAVE RISE TO A SHARP DISCUSSION AT THE 679 IOITHE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY RECENT REGULAR SESSION OF CONGRESS AND THE EXECUTIVE WAS GIVEN POWER TO PROVIDE FOR THE REORGANIZATION OF THE UNIVERSITY IT WILL PROBABLY BE A MATTER OF TWO OR THREE YEARS WHEN CONGRESS WILL RE VISE THE LAW AFFECTING HIGHER EDUCATION THE UNIVERSITY OF ST MARK HAS SIX FACULTIESTHEOLOGY JURIS PRUDENCE MEDICINE NATURAL AND MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES LETTERS AND POLITICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES THE UNIVERSITY OF CUZCO HAS FACULTIES OF JURISPRUDENCE LETTERS POLITICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES AND A SECTION OR PARTIAL FACULTY OF NATURAL SCIENCE THE OTHER TWO HAVE THESE SAME FACULTIES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE LAST MENTIONED UNIVERSITY INSTRUCTION IS CONTROLLED BY THE STATE BUT THERE IS MORE AUTONOMY IN HIGHER EDUCATION THAN IN SECONDARY OR PRIMARY IN STRUCTION THE ADMINISTRATION OF EACH UNIVERSITY IS UNDER THE IM MEDIATE JURISDICTION OF A UNIVERSITY COUNCIL ITS DUTIES ARE SIMILAR IN NATURE TO THOSE OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES IN OUR LARGE PRIVATE UNI VERSITIES FOR LIMA IT CONSISTS OF THE RECTOR THE VICERECTOR THE SECRETARY THE DEANS OF THE VARIOUS FACULTIES AND ANOTHER DELEGATE FROM EACH FACULTY THE DELEGATES ARE ELECTED BY THE PROFESSORS OF THE RESPECTIVE FACULTIES IN THE OTHER UNIVERSITIES THE COUNCIL IN CLUDES ALL OF THE PROFESSORS THE COUNCIL ADMINISTERS THE

FORMER TWO INSTITUTIONS ALSO HAS A PREPARATORY SECTION WITH THE VIEW TO REVIEW ING THE WORK OF THE PRIMARY EDUCATION HIENCE IN REALITY THIS SCHOOL CANNOT PROPERLY BE CLASSED AS AN INSTITUTION OF SUPERIOR EDUCATION AFTER THE PREPARATORY WORK SPECIALIZED WORK IS GIVEN ALONG LINES OF MANUAL TRAINING AND INDUSTRIAL ARTS SPACE WILL NOT PERMIT A REVIEW OF THE VARIOUS PROBLEMS WHICH NEED ATTENTION IN A REVISION OF THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF THE COUNTRY SOME OF THE DEFECTS HAVE BEEN MENTIONED IN THE ARTICLE BUT WHAT IS ESPECIALLY NEEDED IS A CHANGE IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE MACHINERY UNDER A NEW LAW OF CONGRESS WHICH SHALL REORGANIZE THE WORK OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION ON A PERMANENT BASIS THE COUNTRY IS READY FOR THIS CHANGE AND A SPECIAL COMMISSION ESTABLISHED BY SUPREME DECREE LAST APRIL WILL PRESENT A PROJECT TO CONGRESS IT IS CERTAIN THAT IT WILL CONTAIN RADICAL CHANGES BUT IT IS NOT SO CERTAIN THAT CONGRESS WILL ACCEPT THESE 682 I04

Cuzco Cuzco Peru There can be little doubt that the greatest problem confronting Peru today is the organization and extension of public instruc tion1 The country is in a fair way towards settling its boundary controversies with the possible exception of the Tacna and Arica question pending with Chile Hence the boundaries need no longer be the central theme of discussion and agitation by the large majority of Peruvian citizens As a background for the discussion of the educational problem in Peru it seems expedient to state briefly some of the obstacles which impede rapid progress to the best interests of education In the first place the physiography of the country merits consideration With an area approximately one and a half million square kilometers and a country practically divided into three more or less inde pendent sections Peru is severely handicapped in carrying on the functions of government The coastal region extends along the western part of the Republic in a strip averaging less than a hun dred miles in width It is generally devoid of rainfall the year round It occupies about ten per cent of the area of the republic The Sierra or mountainous region lies to the eastward and is the seat of the plateaus and high peaks of the Andes Roughly speak ing it occupies about twentyfive per cent of the area of the repub lic The mountains are largely responsible for the climatic condi tions of the country Still farther to the east is an immense tract of land exceedingly rich in flora and fauna It occupies almost two thirds of the area of the country and with the exception of two or three small districts is practically unknown Located in the upper regions of the Amazon basin it is a land of present surprises and of great promise for the future At present it is sparsely set tled and indeed inhabited in part by an uncivilized race I hereby desire to acknowledge the courtesy of several persons who have so kindly supplied me with the necessary data all of which is of an official character I refer to Dr Matias Leon ExMinister of Instruction Dr H E Bard Adviser to the Minister of Instruction Dr Justus Perez Figuerola DirectorGeneral of Instruc tion Mr Aurelio Gamarra y Hernandez Chief of the Bureau of Secondary and Higher Education and Dr Vincente Delagado Chief Statistician of the Department of Instruction 663The Annals of the American Academy The second obstacle to the rapid development of a rational educational system may be considered under the social organization of the country As in the United States there is a great mixture of races The main distinction in a comparison between the two countries however lies in the fact that in the former country the white element predominates numerically considered whereas in the latter the Indian or Cholo element i e the descendants of the Incas comes first Most of the white and mestizo or mixed white and red blood is found along the coast It is the center of influence of the Spaniard The other two regions are settled chiefly by the mestizo element The negro element is also present and is concentrated chiefly in the coastal region Allowing for exceptions there is naturally a difference in the intellectual capacities of these race mixtures This difference comes out more clearly in an in vestigation of the location and work of secondary and higher insti tutions of learning which are concentrated chiefly in the coastal region Yet this region has only about twentyfive per cent of the three and a half million inhabitants of the country More might be added with reference to the influence of climate racial assimilation and the effects of Spanish colonization upon the social organization but none of these presents insurmountable obstacles to the advance ment of public instruction Political drawbacks also exist and they are most in evidence in affecting the administration of the public schools of the country Peru has a cabinet or ministerial form of governmentas in France The Minister of Justice Instruction and Religion who is one of the six Ministers of State has charge of public instruction Under the minister is a directorgeneral of public instructiona position which was created last January2 The DirectorGeneral therefore has all the administrative work of public instruction in his hands Under him are the following chiefs at the head of their respective bureaus These include the chief of secondary and higher education of the personnel and general administration an import ant post under the present organization of equipment and sup plies of statistics and archives Aside from these bureaus under Previously there was a DirectorGeneral of Justice Public Instruction and Religion but by decree that of Public Instruction has been established separately Legally the work of secondary and higher education was left in the hands of this Director and primary education in the hands of another Director 664 86Public Instruction in Peru 87 the directorgeneral the minister has an expert adviser in matters appertaining to educational administration Concerning the present organization it would seem highly desirable to make the work of all of these officials free from political influence except that of the minister There is also a Superior Council of Education but it has had a rather checkered career It has been suggested that there be a separate minister for education but there are two sides to this question3 The constitution of Peru guarantees the existence and diffu sion of primary instruction which shall be free and obligatory4 The present law of public instruction primary second and higher instruction was passed by Congress in I9oI the portion dealing with primary instruction was remodeled in December I905 Upon these two laws are based numerous executive decrees amplifying the system of public instruction Primary Instruction Elementary education is obligatory for boys between the ages of six and fourteen and for girls between the ages of six and twelve Primary schools are of two classes I elementary 2 centros It will be noted that Peru has been securing for some years from time to time from Germany Belgium Switzerland and other European countries teachers for the national colegios The duties of these teachers have been confined entirely to teaching in these schools or in a few instances to directing them It was only a year ago that it was realized there was need of welltrained and experienced men in the administrative branch of education Dr Manuel V Villaran who had made a thorough study of the educational situation Revista Universitaria Afio III Vol II No 23 pp 121 and No 24 pp 105130 Sept and Oct 1908 upon being called to the Cabinet with the portfolio of Justice Instruction and Religion decided to engage from the States a director general and four departmental instructors of primary instruction and a director and number of special teachers for the national colegios and for normal instruction Dr Villarans plans were only partially carried out when a change of Cabinet brought to the department of instruction a new Minister who did not find himself entirely in sympathy with the plans of his predecessor Before this time however four of these men were on their way to Peru They were men especially pre pared by practical experience as well as by large academic and professional training for the work they were to do They are now rendering important service of an administrative character the full value of which will receive recognition only in time Dr H E Bard who is adviser to the Minister of Instruction had for some years before coming to Peru given special attention to the administrative sciences and particularly to the science of educational administration He had had valuable practical experience also in this field in the Philippine Islands Some farreaching reforms have already been effected through his initiative It is expected that the work of these men will demonstrate the need of others like them and in this way will one of Perus greatest educational needs be met 4Article 24 See Constitution of LatinAmerican Republics published by the International Union of American Republics 665escolares or literary school centers Kindergarten schools are also provided in two or three instances The elementary schools take up the studies of the first two years work of primary educa tion From the following curriculum it will be seen that in these two years reading writing arithmetic the metric system notions of geography and history of Peru the Christian doctrine and physical exercises are provided The executive decree of June 20 I906 makes a conscious effort to provide primary education in a com prehensive way but in practice the results have not been perfectly satisfactory The curriculum for the five years of primary instruction follows First Year Second Year 1 Reading Reading and and writing writing 2 Arithmetic Arithmetic Third Year Reading

chemical nomenclature acids bases salts The fifthyear course in arithmetic includes mental operations the decimal system prime numbers maximum and minimum divisor proportion metric system weights measures and money systems bookkeeping commercial documents Executive decrees provide for the division of the country into sixty school districts for the purpose of primary education although previously there were over one hundred school districts In each of these districts is an inspector who sees that the school regulations of the central government are carried into effect There is an exception in the case of Lima and Callao where two inspectors are provided one for boys schools the other for girls and mixed schools5 In the past the inspectors have not always proved efficient visiting the schools infrequently and knowing or caring little about the requirements of their position Consequently there has been a recent decree providing qualifications which may result in a better system of inspection The new decree however has one serious defect in that it requires the inspector to telegraph the fact of his intended visit to the directorgeneral in Lima and to the subprefect of the province which he expects to visit By this means the school authorities may secure advance notice and be prepared An in spector will now be required to have I a degree bachelor or diplomas from the normal school 2 the inspectors now in office must take an examination within ninety days to prove their compe tence otherwise new inspectors are to be appointed6 Furthermore the Minister of Public Instruction has another check on the work of the schools in the special inspectors visitadores who may be 6The latest decree is dated January 22 1910 EExecutive decree of January 22 1910 The previous decree provided for departmental provincial and district inspectors The present plan therefore according to the claims of its advocates effects an economy in the number of in spectors increases their efficiency reduces the amount of official routine and saves money 667 89The Annals of the American Academy appointed from time to time by the minister in order to make special investigations In general at least one elementary school giving the work of the first two years of primary instruction must be established for every two hundred inhabitants The departmental capital must have at least two primary schoolsone for boys the other for girls the provincial capital must have at least one primary school even if the population should not be large enough Public schools are estab lished by decree The last annual report of the Minister of Instruction shows that the number of schools in actual operation school year I907 was 2262 or about one hundred less than there should have been Of these over ninety per cent gave instruction for the first two years of primary education only840 were for boys 677 were for girls and 745 were mixed schools for boys and girls Instruction was given to I6I660 pupils during the year twothirds of whom were boys and only 5450 of these received instruction in the upper classes of the primary school The average daily attendance was about sixty per cent With the pupils in private schools less than onefifth of a million of children were receiving primary education throughout the Republic7 This appears to be a small proportion for a population estimated at more than 3500000 inhabitants8 The following table will furnish the details Receive Do not receive Could Could Could Could instruction instruction read not read write not write

Peru 5644 blacks Unfortunately it is impossible to make comparison of this data by the three physiographic divisions since it is given only for the twentyone departments of the Republic For the de partment of Lima which includes the capital and a few small towns and plantations there were IIo38 whites 26664 indigenous or native 12468 mestizos and 2432 blacks In a way therefore Peru has its racial problem to settle from the educational point of view just as we have in the United States It would seem plausible that the introduction of American teachers and American methods from sections where the education of mixed races is prominent should be carefully considered by the government of Perul The teachers in the primary schools are women in the majority of cases Although supposed to have a diploma the majority of teachers are not so providedl2 Thus out of 2944 teachers 1225 men 1719 women twothirds did not possess a diploma At present there are three normal schoolsone for men and two for women Two are located in Lima and a comparatively smaller one for women in Arequipa Previously there were more but financial and other difficulties have caused the closing of the others The act of Congress March 1901 provided at least three normal schools for men and three for women In the normal school for men the curriculum provides three years of study which differs somewhat from that provided for the womens normal school In the normal school for women in Lima the course of studies is as follows First year Spanish grammar and literature penmanship arithmetic geography history religion object lessons domestic economy and hygiene manual training French or English vocal music physical exercises attendance upon model classes in the School of Practice Second year general notions and anthropology and infant psychology pedagogy history general hygiene domes tic economy religion elocution and composition manual training French or English music physical exercises

Americant Academy music physical exercises daily teaching in the School of Practice pedagogical conferences The courses at the normal school for women in Arequipa are most limited The government pays all expenses of most of the pupils in the normal schools in Lima and in exchange requires them to teach in the primary schools of the respective departments from which the students come for a certain number of years They are guaranteed a minimum salary per month for this work13 During the school year I907 the mens normal school had fiftythree students the womens normal school in Lima fortyfour and in Arequipa sixty threel4 A total of about Iooooo was expended during I906 for salaries equipment and other expenses and twentyfive students were graduated These figures fairly represent the work of preced ing years Revenue and Expenditure for Primary Education The Minister of Instruction has the portfolios of Justice and Religion in addition to that of Education Consequently the con gressional appropriations for the Department of Education form only a part of the revenues and expenditures which he controls Nevertheless to insure at least a certain amount of revenue which would not depend entirely upon the action of Congress a law was passed providing special sources of income All told the revenues for primary instruction are derived from the following sources a A special tax or mojonazgo on alcoholic drinks and mineral water insofar as money from this source does not furnish more than fifty per cent of the total revenue of any municipality b local taxes created by special acts of Congress c special funds and revenues from property d thirty per cent of the departmental revenues deducting from this the subventions assigned to secondary instruc tion on the basis of the departmental appropriation of I905 e five per cent of the national revenues f fines imposed for infractions of the law and decrees relating to primary instruction In I9o6 these revenues amounted to 1I50775 in I907 they were slightly higher in I908 they amounted to I309090 Owing to the eco nomic crisis the sum voted by Congress for I9I0 has been reduced 1SDecrees of April 4 1907 and January 1910 Report of the Minister of Instruction 1908 Vol II p 338 670 92Public Instruction in Perut considerably so that less than a million dollars were available this year Some Defects in the System of Primary Education As late as I860 Dr Francisco Calderon in his excellent Diccionario de la Legislacion Peruana stated that the country still felt the lamentable consequences of the repressive system of educa tion which had been provided by the Spanish government during the colonial period15 Although most of these consequences have disappeared today some still remain A temporary decree bearing on public instruction had been promulgated in I855the first gene ral decree up to that time It remained in force until 1876 although attempts had been made in the meanwhile to change it By the latter decree issued March I9 the system of public instruc tion was decentralized especially as regards primary instruction The departmental authorities were intrusted with secondary the municipal councils with primary education i e so far as the finan cial powers were concerned The directive body was a Superior Council of Public Instruction It soon became evident that the local authorities did not or would not provide suitable funds and mat ters went from bad to worse Under these circumstances Congress enacted a law in I9go centralizing the administration to a large ex tenta work which has been carried out more thoroughly by the act of I905 for the central government was given full control of public instruction16 The majority of the reports of the Ministers of Instruction throughout this period aside from the question of administrative centralization emphasize the importance of primary education Yet almost invariably these same reports state that primary educa tion was in a condition far from satisfactory The complaints usually take the form of lack of money lack of schools and equip ment dearth of suitable teachers and the need of better salaries and more punctual payment of teachers Thus in his report for 1893 the Minister of Instruction pleads for a broader basis of prim ary education in accordance with the Constitution and complains of the comparatively large sum spent for secondary and higher Vol II p 324 6Exposiclon sobre el Estado de la Instrucci6n Pfiblica en el Peri enviado al Congreso PanAmericano de Chile pp 46 671 93The Annals of the American Academy education when the majority of the children of the country did not even know how to read or write when many of the provinces did not have teachers nor school buildings nor any income for the most indispensable equipment He blamed these conditions largely upon the decentralized system of administration17 Unfortunately the defects which existed under the decentralized system of administra tion have by no means disappeared With several exceptions they are just as glaring as before The main defects lie in the administra tion itself and the lack of sufficient funds to carry out a progressive program of reforms The administrative machinery needs remodel ing but should undoubtedly remain centralized The financial prob lem is considered very serious at present but even here there is room for improvement in the expenditure of the money voted by Congress for schools The State could really spend profitably five times the sum voted for this year It would then be in a much bet ter position to carry out the provision of the Constitution providing obligatory primary education This applies with added force to the education of girls by public authority As one prominent Peruvian writer puts it So long as the intellectual and social level of the family is not raised by the education of the mother our people will forge ahead very slowly That task the realization of which is of national import ance belongs to man who should make it a reality Women cannot at one and the same time attempt the problem propose the remedy and bring to pass the miracle The task belongs to man The surest way is to multiply the centers of instruction and provide for the better education of woman 18 Secondary Education Administration and Curriculum Secondary education is under the direction of the Minister of

given in a sixyear course The change to four years was based in large part upon the French reforms of I90219 Although the de crees have provided the full course of studies in secondary education it has not always followed that each years work has been given in full in each colegio Last year the government had also approved a plan of com mercial education for Guadalupe Colegio which I had the honor to formulate It gives the student a chance to get secondary education which will put him more in harmony with his economic environment There is great need for such education owing to the

of schoolsthe colegio and the liceo The work of the for mer can be determined by referring to the curriculum already given The colegio was intended to be a steppingstone to higher education The liceo was intended to provide instruction adapted to agriculture commercial education and mining and mechanical arts in order that pupils might acquire the knowledge indispensable for dedicating themselves to industries dependent on those branches of instruction Colegios were to be established in places where universities were located and in departmental capitals at the discretion of the Supe rior Council of Public Instruction Liceos according to the law were to be established in provincial capitals IOI provinces in Peru by the same Council As yet liceos have not been established nor is there any likelihood of such action taking place The course of studies was to be formulated by the Council as the basis for an executive decree and instruction in the colegio or the liceo was to last six years No plan of studies could be modified during a period of five years Yet by decree of I904 the course of studies was cut down to four years in the colegio the only institutions of secondary instruction in existence and the amount of work per year in creased Vhatever advantages may have been produced by cutting down the course to four years this action illustrates one of the defects from which the educational work suffers I refer to the 20Decree of January 29 1910 674 96Public Instruction in Peru plethora of decrees introduced by rapidly changing ministers Some of the decrees moreover are evidently a violation of the spirit if not the letter of the laws of Congress The Director and the Professors In each colegio and liceo the law of I9OI made provision for a director a subdirector a secretary the professors inspectors and the office personnel The director is supposed to have received a university degree but this provision is not always enforced He is expected to reside in the colegio He is responsible for the carrying out of laws and other regulations for the discipline of the school for the work of the employees for the proper accounting of the revenues of the school for the calling of faculty meetings and for the annual report showing certain details with reference to matriculation and examination of students equipment etc The subdirector has to do more directly with discipline and aids the director He is also expected to live in the school building if there are any students boarding at the institution The professors are classed as full professors and assistant adjunto professors The former may hold their position for ten years as a result of a competitive examinationa position which may be made permanent if the professor has written a meritorious scientific work within this limit The Superior Council of Pub lic Instruction decides on the merits of the case Less than a dozen positions of this type exist today in a total teaching staff for all national colegios of more than 400 The appointment of professors is by the Director or by the government directlydepending on the subjects to be taught Salaries are by no means uniform in the colegio Moreover many professors simply teach part of the time in a national colegio and devote the rest of their time in private colegios or engage in other work Complaints have been made on this score as well as regards the salary which may be said to aver age about five dollars per month for one hour of instruction per week The adjunto professors simply replace the regular profes sors in case of absence of the latter Quite a number of foreign teachers chiefly German Belgium and Swiss have been teaching in the national colegios during the last three or four decades It must be added however that they are 675 97The Annals of the American Academy by no means looked upon with favor by the native teachers The professor is aided by inspectors in maintaining discipline in the classroom This system of discipline has its counterpart in few educational codes of other countries it certainly does not offer any real advantages Students in Secondary Institutions The school age of pupils attending the colegios is presumably from thirteen to seventeen The former decree rquired the pupils to have completed the twelfth year but in practice this has not always been insisted upon The new decree requires pupils of the first year to be between the ages of twelve and fifteen Admission to the colegio may be by examination or upon satisfactory comple tion of primary instruction The latter method prevails almost entirely There were twentyeight national colegios in Peru in I908 with a total of 3289 pupils The largest and most important by far is Guadalupe Colegio in Lima with over five hundred pupils In fact this colegio serves as the model for the others and has a building costing all told about half a million dollars In I904 there were twentythree colegios with a total of 204I pupils Only three of the national colegios are for girls with a total of about 200 pupils These three colegios are located in Cuzco Ayacucho and Trujillo Supplementing the national colegios are the private cole gios located chiefly in Cuzco and Lima and directed by the church or as business ventures These private colegios numbered thirty four in I908 of which twenty were for boys and fourteen for girls The number of boys who attended totaled IoI6 of girls 275 The law provides that pupils may board in the colegio The maximum number of such pupils is determined by the Superior Council of Public Instruction according to the law but not in prac tice Many pupils both in national and private colegios take advantage of this provision of the law The expense of a pupil in Guadalupe Colegio may be taken as representative The charges here include the following Matricula tion fee I for annual examinations 2 tuition 20 per year for pupils in the primary grades which happen to be given in this colegio and for the first two years of secondary instruction and 30 for the 676 98Public Instruction in Peru last two years of secondary instruction board and lodging for the year I05 fees for the use of equipment 3 although third and fourthyear students pay 250 additional for the use of the labora tories Laundry charges for those who care to avail themselves of the opportunity amount to I50 per month In Igog Guadalupe Colegio provided board and lodging for 175 pupils and in addition board for over 200 additional pupils This year the number was almost doubled owing to extensions and improvement to the building still under way Practically each department gives scholarships to a limited number of pupils many of whom are sent to Guadalupe Colegio Such a scholarship provides all tuition and living expenses The students are not accustomed as a general rule to do much if any school work at home School hours are from 8 to II in the morning and I to 5 in the afternoon six days per week As the curriculum provides less than thirty hours of classroom work the other hours are utilized for study physical training and military drill Irregularity of attendance on the part of pupils and even of professors is one of the marked defects of administration which merits rigorous corrective measures Examinations and Prizes Mention must be made of the system of prizes existing in all branches of educationpublic as well as private Medals books and other useful objects are distributed for the meritorious at the close of the school year The annual exercises correspond to our high school commencement only here the exercises come at the close of the year The prefect of the department or in Lima the Minister of Instruction and perhaps even the President and other school authorities attend the exercises at the national colegio The system of examinations is worthy of special attention At the close of each of the four years there is an examination in each subject in the official program of studies The term work counts onethird of the general average The written examination usually lasting less than one hour counts onethird and the oral exami nation usually five to ten minutes for each pupil the other third For national colegios special examining boards of three members each are appointed by the Director The professor of the class 677 99The Annals of the American Academy acts as president of the board For private colegios whose pupils desire to present themselves for the examination in accordance with the official program three special examining boards are appointed by the government For Lima they are appointed by the Minister for the departments by the prefects These boards examine in let ters sciences and languages respectively It was my privilege to act as president of the last mentioned board for Lima during I909 The examining boards for private colegios receive a fee for every student who is examined regardless of whether he presents himself or whether he passes the examination For national col egios one copy of the marks is sent to the Minister of Instruction for private colegios one is sent to the Minister one is left in the colegio itself and the third is sent to the national colegio of the department in which the private colegio is located The examining boards for private colegios are also required to prepare a report for the Minister relative to the pedagogical conditions existing in each colegio which has been visited This board can only examine in the colegios which have previously sent to the Minister a request for such examination including in this request the list of students who are to be examined Practically all private colegios do this A method of examination somewhat similar prevails in the universi ties The system is not only cumbersome and timeconsuming but in the public schools at least it is subject to logrolling methods Moreover the actual examinationsoral and writtenneed modi fication Even more serious defects might be noted as regards the examinations for private colegios A competent national exam ining board or perhaps even several departmental boards should provide uniform examinations based on the official curriculum Income and Expenditures The income of national colegios consists I of the sum voted by Congress 2 any sum voted by the department 3 special in come assigned to a colegio 4 fees of students 5 rent from property owned by the schoolusually insignificant The budget of each colegio is made up toward the close of the school year by an Economic Council This council consists of the Director the treas urer a professor of the colegio and two fathers whose sons are attending the school The council meets several times during the 678 IOOPublic Instruction in Peru year to consider financial matters of the colegio and towards this end it is generally convened by the Director For the twentyeight colegios in I908 the total income amounted to 3Ioooo about twentyfive per cent of which came from tuition fees It was spent in large part for salaries A smaller sum was spent for maintenance of the school buildings equipment and supplies On the whole there should be more money appro priated for secondary education although it should at the same time constitute a smaller proportion of the total spent on public instruc tion than is the case at present The objects towards which this increase could be devoted advantageously include I adequate buildings and equipment 2 pay of professors 3 extension of commercial education in various national colegios There is need for greater elasticity in the courses open to stu dents in the colegio The law of 190o in providing the liceos sought to attain this end The financial condition of the country however does not justify separate schools Separate departments within the colegio should be provided along the lines of the organi zation in our high schools The establishment of a commercial department in the leading colegio of the country is a step in the right direction After the adoption of a wellconsidered plan providing separate departments for the colegio the government should make an earnest effort to encourage a larger proportion of the students to attend the national colegios than is the case at present As it is the national colegio is superior to the private colegio from almost every point of view and yet for one reason or another about forty per cent of the total num ber of students are attending private colegios It is a fact of some significance that there is no national colegio for girls in Lima and that there are only three in the country Higher Education The universities of Peru include the University of St Mark in Lima founded I571 by Pius X and royal decree of Philip II and the minor universities of Cuzco Arequipa and Trujillo These were established in I692 I835 and 1824 respectively The univer sity of Cuzco was closed temporarily last year owing to certain irregularities The occasion gave rise to a sharp discussion at the 679 IOIThe Annals of the American Academy recent regular session of Congress and the executive was given power to provide for the reorganization of the university It will probably be a matter of two or three years when Congress will re vise the law affecting higher education The University of St Mark has six facultiestheology juris prudence medicine natural and mathematical sciences letters and political and administrative sciences The University of Cuzco has faculties of jurisprudence letters political and administrative sciences and a section or partial faculty of natural science The other two have these same faculties with the exception of the last mentioned University instruction is controlled by the state but there is more autonomy in higher education than in secondary or primary in struction The administration of each university is under the im mediate jurisdiction of a University Council Its duties are similar in nature to those of the board of trustees in our large private uni versities For Lima it consists of the rector the vicerector the secretary the deans of the various faculties and another delegate from each faculty The delegates are elected by the professors of the respective faculties In the other universities the Council in cludes all of the professors The Council administers the property of the university approves the annual budget authorizes special expenditure provides for auditing of accounts acts upon the propo sals of the rector for the better administration of the institution formulates the bylaws creates or changes courses and professor ships proposes to the Superior Council of Public Instruction changes deemed essential in granting university degreesbachelor or doctor The rector of the university must have a doctors degree and although appointed as a rule for four years may succeed himself He and the vicerector are normally elected by the University Coun cil except the University of St Mark where only the deans of the faculties make the selection The rector is responsible for the administration and progress of the university and acts as the inter mediary in communication with the Minister of Education Each faculty elects its own dean and subdean formulates its budget which it submits later to the University Council examines candidates for degrees approves the outline of studies for each course author izes payment by the dean of sums exceeding 50 and makes sug gestions with reference to the curriculum There are two grades of 680 I02Public Instruction in Peru professors viz principal or active professors and adjunct profes sors who replace the former in case of leave of absence The lat ter receive a salary only during the time that they teach The active professors are of two classes and include those who are named ad interim and those who secure the position through competitive exam ination They must have the doctors degree As a rule they have less than ten hours of actual teaching per week moreover they are almost invariably engaged in other lines of activity outside of uni versity circles The courses within a given faculty are usually ar ranged in groups and the professor must teach all the subjects within a given group No professor is permitted to give courses in more than two of these groups At the University of Arequipa for example one group includes courses on diplomacy private in ternational law and history of the treaties of Peru The law of I9OI provides the courses which are to be given the arrangement in groups is left to administrative authority Students can matriculate in the University upon graduating from the colegio To secure a degree in the faculty of theology requires six years of study in jurisprudence five years medicine seven years sciences letters or political and administrative sciences three years These are required for both degrees viz bachelor and doctor A student is permitted to register in several faculties under certain restrictions In order to matriculate in the faculties of jurispru dence and political sciences a student must have completed two years in the faculty of letters For example he may matriculate in the faculty of political and administrative sciences as a regular student and also in the faculty of letters to pursue special or regular advanced courses21 With the exception of the University of St Mark the univer sities have little property of their own from which they may secure revenue Hence most of their income comes from the state sub ventions In I908 the income for all four universties amounted only to a third of a million dollars Of this total matriculation fees furnished sixteen per cent of the total income of the University of St Mark fifteen per cent in the University of Arequipa twentyfive per cent in the University of Cuzco and thirty per cent in the Uni S1Annual Report Minister of Education 1908 68i I03The Annals of the American Academy versity of Trujillo In other words about onefifth of the total in come comes from tuition fees Besides the four universities there are three other national in stitutions of superior instruction viz the Engineering School the Agricultural College and the School of Industrial Artsall located in Lima The first of these institutions has the following depart ments a preparatory section requiring two years with emphasis on natural and mathematical sciences b department of civil engineering 3 years c of mining engineering 3 years d of mechanical engineering 3 years e of electrical engineering I year The Agricultural and Veterinary College also has a preparatory section of one year with special emphasis on natural sciences The regular work of the Agricultural College requires three more years of study In addition to these studies there is a special Grange School giving a twoyears course along specialized lines The School of Industrial Arts as in the case of the former two institutions also has a preparatory section with the view to review ing the work of the primary education HIence in reality this school cannot properly be classed as an institution of superior education After the preparatory work specialized work is given along lines of manual training and industrial arts Space will not permit a review of the various problems which need attention in a revision of the educational system of the country Some of the defects have been mentioned in the article but what is especially needed is a change in the administrative machinery under a new law of Congress which shall reorganize the work of public instruction on a permanent basis The country is ready for this change and a special commission established by supreme decree last April will present a project to Congress It is certain that it will contain radical changes but it is not so certain that Congress will accept these 682 I04

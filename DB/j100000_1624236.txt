j100000,Science,1624236,University and Educational News,i295431,146 SCIENCE MR JOHN MILNE has recently advocated an earthquake survey of the world He states that for 5000 twenty observatories willing to co operate can be provided with the necessary in struments and calls attention to the important theoretical and practical problems that can thus be solved One of the recent earthquakes in Japan was recorded about 16 minutes after its occurrence in Mr Milnes observatory on the Isle of Wight and showed that there had been an error in telegraphic transmission to the news papers of two days whilst another gave an ac curate account of a catastrophe the details of which were not known until mails arrived some three weeks later An absence of records from the Isle of Wight seismographs has on more than one occasion shown that telegrams have exag gerated seismic effects and in one instance at leastreferring to a recently reported disaster in Kobeindicated that the sender regardless of the alarm he might create was without foundation for his widelypublished message The immediate benefits derived by observatories at which instruments were installed over and above the speedy announcement of great catas trophes in distant places would be that the records of earth movements would throw light upon some of the otherwise unaccountable de flections shown in diagrams from magneto graphs barographs and other instruments sensible to slight displacements whilst diurnal and other changes in level affecting astronomical observations would be countinuously recorded MR BENNETT who is acting as British Con sulGeneral at Galatz has prepared says the London Times a report on the petroleum in dustry in Rumania where he thinks it is likely to play an important part in future com mercial development Petroleum exists in abundance in Rumania in the zone stretching from TurnSeverin on the western frontier along the foot of the Carpathians towards Bu kowina and Galicia It is found throughout the whole of this region but especially in the Olt Dimbovitza Prahova Buzeu and Tazlan valleys It is said also to be found in the whole of the plains down to the Danube There are about fifty borings and eight hundred wells dug by hand in the five districts above mentioned but these are all shallow and N S VOL V No 108 the output in 189495 reached 800000 tons Although petroleum has been worked in Ru mania for 25 years the industry is evidently in its infancy still The greater part of the land is owned by the state and large holders who reside in the towns and will not invest money in industrial enterprise grain has monopolized the energy and capital of the Rumanians and the forests and mineral wealth of the country are neglected Thus it was not until 1895 that a mining law was passed and up to that date the ownership of land below the surface had never been determined Nor is there a body of native mining engineers About a third of the crude oil is taken from the wells of four firms while the remainder comes from the workings of numerous small proprietors who heve not the capital necessary for proper de velopment of the deposits UNIVERSITY AND EDUCATIONAL NEWS THE Johns Hopkins University has published the twentyfirst annual report of President Gilman The report itself presented to the trustees on November 21st extends to sixteen pages only but there are two appendices One of these contains the reports on the chief branches of study prepared by the principal in structors in the several departments together with statements regarding the library the press the State Weather Service The State Geological Survey and the marine laboratory In conclusion there is given an interesting ret rospect of the twenty years now completed by the University The important service per formed by the Johns Hopkins University for education and science in America is adequately witnessed by the fact that nearly half of its students have become teachers The following institutions have on their staff more than ten students from the University Johns Hopkins University 67 Chicago 23 Wisconsin 19 Bryn Mawr 18 Leland Stanford Jr 17 Michigan 17 Pennsylvania 16

on January 13th elected Professor James M Crafts of the chemistry department chairman pro tern of the faculty pending the election of a successer to the late Gen F A Walker as President MR G A HOBART VicePresident elect has given 5000 to Rutgers of which he is a graduate DISCUSSION AND CORRESPONDENCE A NATIONAL DEPARTMENT OF SCIENCE To THE EDITOR OF SCIENCE I have just seen in the current number of SCIENCE Dr Dabneys discussion of this subject and feeling that the natural inferences most persons un acquainted with government work would draw from it must be not only inaccurate but mis chievous I feel obliged to point out that there are at least two sides to the question and it is extremely doubtful whether the establishment of such a department would be beneficial to science economical or efficient to a degree war ranting the change With much that Dr Dabney has written I am in accord it is his conclusions and the inferences to be drawn from his manner of presenting the facts that demand further examination It is nothing new for people to assume that the proposal of a new set of well chosen names a new classification of well known facts or a cleverly drawn scheme of organization of pre viously distinct agencies has in itself added something to knowledge or possesses an in herent power of some undefined sort to make things easier cheaper or better Such assump tions are at the basis of nearly all cranky theories as well as occasional good ones No scientific man should accept such hypotheses without a thorough investigation of the facts I take it that the object of a scientific bureau is to gather digest and disseminate facts in re gard to matters with which it is officially charged If this work is done promptly effi ciently and accurately at a reasonable cost the bureau justifies its existence and not otherwise It is of no consequence whatever to the bureau and its work whether it is attached to one de partment or another or to none if the bureau is conducted by a competent person on scientific principles and with a view simply to getting 147 the best possible results The origin and suc cess of our scientific bureaus has been due as Dr Dabney points out to the fact that they are inthe main the crystallized result of individual effort exerted in a particular field and with the object of attaining certain definite ends The men to whom we owe our best scientific agencies under government worked and often gave their lives prematurely not to get offices or titles or salaries or to add a new name to the lists of bureaus in the blue books but to promote research and benefit the nation by its results This too has been the object of their successors in conscientious devotion The danger and difficulty which has threatened the bureaus and never more than at the present time has been the intrusion of politics or per sonal interest in appointments and the stifling of individual initiative by an excess of red tape imposed generally in good faith by Congress with the idea of preventing abuses From Dr Dabneys account it might be sup posed that a number of bureaus were to a greater or less extent duplicating each others work and the inference is direct from his argument that this duplication might and should be pre vented by a consolidation of the various bureaus The supposition is I believe quite erroneous and the inference wholly fallacious The bureaus exist to do work and the advis ability of any change in organization must be measured by its capacity for increasing results improving efficiency and promoting economy without lessening the product measured in re sults If consolidation would diminish results impair efficiency and do away with individual responsibility to any marked degree it would be dearly bought That this would be the case under present conditions there can be hardly any doubt and the coolness with which the proposition which is by no means new has been met in Congress is I am convinced due to the fact that the more influential members as good business men recognize that the hy pothesis is without the essentials of a workable scheme At present most of the bureaus are attached to some department The head of that depart ment has many divisions to supervise In gen eral even if not specially interested in science JANUARY 22 1897

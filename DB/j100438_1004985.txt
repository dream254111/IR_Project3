thefe have been at tended with flattering profpeas of utility By a cheap and eafy procefs water tolerably frefli may be diflilled from common faltwater fo as to help materially in a cafe of fcarcity or want on board a fhip of good equipment The names of Hales Lind and Irvine are remembered to their honour for their exertions in this work To furnith needy men with the means of eating and drinking is certainly a noble difcovery But there is another operation fcarcely lefs neceflary to the preferva tion of health than eating and drinking and that is wahing as applied to the human body and more par ticularly to the clothing which it befouls In a commti nication to profeffor Duncan which has been publifhed in the Edinburgh Annals of Medicine for I 799 and in the third volume of the NewYork

in140 OBSERVATIONS ON THE in a letter I wrote to Timothy Pickering late Secre tary of State to the American Government in November 1799 I recommended barilla or foda as a ftibilance by xvhich the faltwater of the ocean could be fo foftened and altered in its qualities as to become fit for wafhing the clothes of feamen A feaveffel is peculiarly fitted for concentering foul and corrupting things and for converting them into pefti lence and poifon This is one of the moft common ac cidents in failing to the latitudes where there is lheat enough to promote corruption and to exalt feptic fub flances into vapour One of the moft difgufting fights during a voyage is the perfonal naflinefs of many of the crew It is pre tended that much of this is neceffarily conneated with the fervice that the work is dirty and efpecially thiat frefh water cannot be fpared from the veffels ftores to wafh the companys clothing that foap cannot be ufed with oceanwater that faltwater alone will not get them clean and that therefore they are under a neceffity of being un comfortably nafty on long voyages efpecially toward the latter part of them NSow naftinefs of a mans perfon and garments is neceffarily conneaed with a fimilar con dition of hiis bed bedding hammock and bertlh and moft commonly of every thing he handles or has ought to do with If a feaman has firength of conftitution to keep about and do duty his feelings are neverthelefs very un comfortable he is thereby predifpofed to difeafe and in danger vevry moment of becoming fick and if this fhoild really happen hiis chance of recovery is exceed iingly leffened by the filth with which every thing that touches him is impregnated and the venom into which that filth is inceffantly changing Thhus the great difficulties with which a feaman has to fIruggle are iff the unfitnefs of oceanwater to wafi withWATER OF THE OCEAN 141 with and 2d the inutility of foap to aid that fluid in cleanfing his clothes If thefe can be furmounted he will have no excufe for his uncleannefs If after this he becomes uncomfortable or fickly from that caufe it will be owing to his own lazinefs or negligelnce Few fubjeds have been difcuffed with more folicitude than the one How did the ocean acqLire its faltnefs Whether that mafs of waters derived its briny quality gradually by diflolving firata of falt or whether it was furnifhed by its Creator with a due quantity of that ma terial from the beginning are quefliQns not neceffary now to be anfwered It is ftifficient to obferve that it is kept fweet and guarded againft offenfivenefs and corrup tion by the great quantity of ALK ALINE matter it con tains The ocean may indeed be confidered as contain ing fome portion of every thing which water is capable of containing or diffolving and its water is therefore found to furnifh different refults on analyfis when taken up from different depths and in different latitudes Yet various as the compofition of oceanwater is it al ways contains foda magnejia and lime in quantity con fiderable enough to be eafily deteated Of thefe foda is the moft abundant Magnefia is next in quantity And lime though plentiful is believed to exifl in fmaller pro portion than either The alkaline matter fo plentifully difperfed through the water of the ocean exerts its cuftomary neutralizing power after the fame manner and according to the fame laws which govern its feveral kinds on the land and in other places The acids commonly prefent in oceanwater are the fulphuric the fepitc and the uriatic The former of thefe exifts apparently in fmall quantity and is only men tioned becaufe in fome axperiments it has been faid to have been obtained from it in the form of a fulphate of VOL V U limnex42 OBSERVATIONS ON THE line th3ugh1 according to the law of attraaibons we miglht exped to find in it fulphate of foda Tshe vaft amounit of animal matter exifting in the fea would lead Onle a priori to a perfuafion that in certain cafes particu larly along marfhes and fhores where the ftagnating water was muclh heated putrefaCtion would engenderfepiic acid and that this would in fome meafure mingle with the water in its vicinity and not fly away wholly in vapour The quiantity of tthis acid is fo confiderable in fome coves and blays where falt works have been eftablifhed that a quLantity of it adheres to the muriate of foda or common falt and vitiates its quality And this happens in fome fituations to fo high a degree that Neumman Chemical Works by Lewis p 39a takes notice of it obferving  that fea water often contains a nitrous matter the ACID SPIRIT DISTILLED FRaM SEA SALT PROVING A EiENSTRUUM FOR GOLD which the marine acid by itfelf never does anid which nothing but the nitrous will enable it to do Though however this is frequently the cafe it is not always I have examined marine falt whofe acid had no aCtion upon goldAs to the muriatic acid whethler it is as fome of the older chemifls fuppofe a mo dification of the fulphuric and the nitrous or as certain of the moderns believe but a compound bafis of fulphuric and hydrogene there is evidence enough of its exiftence in the ocean in very great plenty On the whole it may be concluded that feawater always contains muriatic acid jfreuentlyfteptic andfometimesfiduphurc There are thus three predominating alkalies and as many acids in the ocean and by the intervention of water they are liquefied and put in a condition to aft each upon the other Confequently the foda in the firft place as the fironger alkali attaches and neutralizes the acids in the order of chemical affinity and forms fulphate feptate and muriate of foda But as the two former are com parativelyWATER OF THE OCEAN paratively rare or fcarce the latter is the predomiinating compound When there is any acid in the watcr beyond the capacity of the foda exifting there to neutralize that part is attraaced by the two earths and according to the force of their refpeafive combinations forms fulphates feptates and muriates of lime and magnefa T hefe falts with earthy bafes in which the muriatic acid is by far more abundant than the other two acids conftitute the bittern and fcratch or flack of the falt makers Thefe falited earths attra6t water fo ftrongly that it is difficult or impoffible to make them cryflallize but wherever they are they keep up a dampnefs and refufe to dry When chemifts fpeak of fea falt they wifh to be un derflood as miieaning  the pure muriate of foda This neutral compoutnd however in its pure ftate is a great rarity Perhaps indeed there is no ftuch thing Expe tience ffiews it is always mingled with greater or lefs quantities of the deliuueflcent falts with earthy eJafes And thefe are fo abundant in fomne forts of falt that they render it unfit for the prefervation of animal provifions Beef and even pork are not guarded by falt fo adulter ated from becoming tainted and putrid That fea falt of this impure quality fhould befit for curing provifilons it ought to undergo a particular refining operation to rid it of its foreign admixtures For want of fuch a procefs fome forts of fea falt though fair to the eye do not poffefs an intire and undivided antifeptic power but fo far as the muriate of foda in the mafs is alloyed by the middle falts of magnefian and calcarious compofition thofe parcels of common falt fo vitiated become unfit for oppofing completely the procefs of putrefaaion And fo far they make a departure from the antifeptic power of pure muriate of foda the manner of whofe aaion I endeavoured to inveftigate in a

This kind of falt is known to abound with the eartlhy falts with whiclh oceani water is charged Dr Percivals experimnents on fea falt have a tendency to hlcw that the feptic quality afcribed by the

render it fit for wafling with It has been afcertained long ago by Profeffor Home in his experiments on bleaching thlat neither fea falt nor any other of the perfedi neutral falts compofed of an acid and an alkali give any bardnzs to water that the common forts of fea falt mnake water hard by means only of the heterogeneou3 falts they retain from the hitlern and that alkalies by precipitating the

thereupon becomesoft or in other words fit for waffhing goods I find146 OBSERVATIONS ON THE I find on experiment that carbonate of foda thrown into ocean water itnmediately renders it turbid the lime and magnefia inflantly turning milky on their difengage ment from their refpeaive portions of acid To make the water fit for waffhing fo much foda muift be added as not only to effedt a complete precipitation of thefe earths but to render the water fufficiently lixivial or alkaline It will then exert its detergent and purifying powers Having entertained doubts at firif whether the water ought not to be decanted off after the lime and magnefia had fettled to the bottom or whether it would not re quire firaining or filtering to render it fit for ufe I con vinced myfelf by experiment that fouil linen could be rendered clean and white by being waffled in alkalized ocean water which contained its whole quantity of pre cipitated earth diffufed through it I rathier think the fmall quantity of thofe impalpable and white particles which adhere to the linen worn uipon the body will be advantageous and wholefome as the fhirts and otlher garments will thereby be enabled to neutralize a portion of the acid and oftentimes noxious matter forined from the fweat and other excretions of the ikin c Thus they will be rather ferviceable than otherwife and as both are in their carbonated flate having borrowed fixed air from the foda they cannot do any harm The general inferences from the whole of the preceding reafoning are thefe i Alkaline fubftances fuch as mag niefia and more powerfully lime and foda are plentifuilly diftributed throtugh the ocean to keep it from becoming foul unhealthy and uninhabitable which doubtlefs would be the cafe if the fulphuric feptic andi muriatic acids abounding in it were not neutralized 2 Where either of thefe acids is but imperfealy faturated as happens when they are united to magnefia and lime they decom poundWATER OF THE OCEAN

j100010,The American Historical Review,1835076,The Childrens Crusade,i304883,THE CHILDRENS CRUSADE THE expeditions which are generally known as the Childrens Crusade made a strong impression upon the contemporaries Com paratively few events of the thirteenth century were recounted by more chroniclers and in more various fashions The accounts con sist frequently of only a few words such as  Eodem anno fuit iter stultortim puerorum Multitudo infancium ab hereticis traditur Saracenis 2 or Eodem anno peregrinacio puerorum 8 But there are also long narratives especially the one by Alberic4 in which he gives from hearsay evidence a story of what happened to the chil dren across the sea Some of the accounts are in rude verse form such as Annis millenis bis centenis duodenis Est cruce signata puerorum multa caterva 5 Annis millenis duodenis adde ducentos Tunc multi pueri sunt effecti peregrini O Anno milleno bis centeno duodeno Cum pueris pueri currunt loca sancta tueri7 Res fit mira nimis puero ductore marinis Sedibus innumeri conveniunt pueri8 Others by their form and wording betray the fact that their material is drawn from an original in verse These two classes of sources indicate that the childrens pilgrimage had early become a theme of popular songs which were widely known On the other hand such men as Vincent of Beauvais and Roger Bacon writing a few decades later felt that the expedition was of sufficient intrinsic importance to justify a mention of it in their learned works9 In the thirteenth century legends soon clustered about a subject of such popular interest Probably there was no account of the movement written by any participant Some chroniclers had known something of the beginnings others had seen the bands on their march no one knew the facts for the whole movement conse 1 Ann Ellenhardi  MGSS XVII Ioi 2Ann Heimburg MGSS XVII 714 3  Cont Claustroneoburg tertia  MGSS IX 634 4MGSS XXIII 893 5 Flores Temp MGSS XXIV 240 6  Chron Elwacen MGSS X 37 7

to follow their own fancy in explaining the points concerning which they had no knowledge Those who were strictly contemporary or who were writing under the glamor of the enthusiasm excited by the children were inclined to ascribe the origin of the movement to divine inspiration0 or to the message of an angel1 or to a vision2 Writers who had known something of the failure of the children conceived of the movement as the work of the devil 1B this opinion gained ground steadily and colored all the later accounts By no one of the chroniclers however was it more naively expressed than by Thomas Fuller who wrote four hundred years later in his Holy War It was done saith my author M Paris by the instinct of the devil who as it were desired a cor dial of childrens blood to comfort his weak stomach long cloyed with murdering of men4 Naturally these legends and beliefs obscured the truth to some extent both then and since For while there is a wealth of material to be gleaned from about sixty writers of the thirteenth century of whom at least sixteen left independent accounts worthy of credence in whole or part modern historians have been influenced by the romantic phases of the movement and have not followed the critical methods which they employ in describing other events Even R6hricht who was generally so sober and matteroffact and in his Geschichte des Kinigreichs Jerusalem wrote such uninspiring although extremely useful chronological summaries of events when he tells of the Childrens Crusade15 accepts uncritically legendary statements of Alberic in order to piece out his tale Janssens whose account16 is on the whole the best did not know all the sources and used his material equally uncritically apparently seeking the pic turesque and striking The same

interesting little book was not a trained historian and consequently it is not surprising to find him using good bad and indifferent sources with equal con fidence In his bibliography of thirty titles he cites as a contemporary a man who died before the movement began he quotes the same account under two different names in three instances and he has many other errors518 9 C Munro Grande Encyclopedie Consequently it has seemed worth while to set forth the facts about this subject There were two movements in I2I2 one of French the other of German children if they were in any way connected as seems prob able such connection cannot be proved from the extant sources For the French children the most trustworthy sources are the anony mous chroniclers of Laon18 Mortemer9 Jumieges20 and Andres2 All of these writers are evidently describing the same movement but there are only a very few facts which are vouched for by more than one From their brief accounts the following story can be gleaned In the month of June I21222 a shepherd boy named Stephen from the village of Cloyes near Vend6me said that the Lord had appeared to him in the guise of a poor pilgrim had accepted bread from him and had given him a letter to carry to the King of France He went to S Denis with shepherd lads of his own age and there the Lord wrought many miracles through him as many have testified There were also very many other boys who were held in great reverence by the vulgar throngs in very many places so that they also were believed to have worked miracles A multitude of chil dren joined them as if they were about to go under their leadership to the holy boy Stephen whom they all recognized as their master and prince23 The bands composed of boys and girls with some youths and older persons marched in procession through the cities castles towns and villages carrying banners candles and crosses and swinging censers singing in the vernacular Lord God exalt Christianity Lord God restore to us the true cross They sang not only these words but many others because there were various processions and each one made such variations as it chose24 When they were asked by their parents or others where they wished to go they replied one and all as if they had been moved by one spirit To God 25 The children could not be restrained at first but according to the annals of Jnmieges they were finally compelled by 18 Bouquet XVIII 715 9 MGSS VI 467 20 Generally called  Anon cont App Roberti de Monte  MGSS XXVI 5I0 21 Bouquet XVIII 574 Andres is near Calais 22 Chronicle of Laon There is no doubt that the year was I2I2 The Chroni cle of Mortemer gives 12I3 but the context indicates why the mistake was made 23 All thus far is from the Laon chronicle The annals of Jumieges also state that the movement started from Vendome 24 Chronicle of Mortemer The accounts from Andres and Jumieges also mention the cities castles etc 25 Chronicle of Andres Cf the annals of Jumieges for their answer To God The Childrens Crusade 519 hunger to return home According to the Laon chronicle the king at last consulted the masters of the University of Paris concerning the matter and at his command the children returned home The other two chroniclers say nothing about the ending With regard to the extent of the movement one says the children came from diverse parts of Gaul another that the movement extended through almost all Gaul a third that it was in the Kingdom of the French the fourtl that the children came from different cities castles towns and villages It is to be noted that Jumieges and Mortemer are near Rouen and Andres near Calais Consequently the places to which our information extends were included roughly in the territory be tween Paris Laon Calais and Rouen with the possibility that the movement started from Vend6me and that it may have extended nmuch more widely All the four sources indicate that the partici pants were many one says an infinite multitude the Laon chronicle gives the number with Stephen as 30000 It is significant that only one of these sources mentions Stephen or indicates that the movement had any unity or purpose except going  to God  Later accounts naturally were prone to fill out the gaps The Laon chronicle says that it seemed to many that the Lord was about to do some great and new thing through these innocents spontaneously gathered together but it turned out very differently The chronicle of Mortemer believed that it was a presage of future events namely of those which happened the next year when the Roman legate signed a multitude with the cross for a new crusade  This idea may well have been fostered by the indefinite statement of the chronicler at Andres that the children  were hastening toward the Mediterranean But not one of these four who are the best authorities hints that the children were thinking of a crusade or even a pilgrimage Yet the movement was connected with the crusades in the minds of those who wrote a little later The Annals of Soissons26 state that the infants and children said they were going across the sea to seek the holy cross and the Chronicle of Barnwell27 that it is reported that the children when asked what they proposed to do said that they were about to recover the cross of Christ The opinion soon became general that the French chil Iren had planned a crusade Later writers added more details An unknown author added to the chronicle of Matthew of Paris an account of the march toward the Mediterranean The leader rode in a chariot surrounded by armed guards and was reputed so holy that anyone counted himself fortunate who could procure a hair 26 MGSS XXVI 521 27 Written about I227 in England520 D C Munro from his head or a thread from his garments But all perished either on land or sea28 In the compilation which formerly passed as the work of Albericus Trium Fontium a long account is given to which reference has already been made At first they came from the neighborhood of Vend6me to Paris When they were about 30000 in number they proceeded to Marseilles as if they were about to cross the sea against the Saracens There two merchants Hugo Ferreus and William Porcus offered to carry them across the sea without charge They filled seven great vessels with the infants two were shipwrecked and all on board were drowned The other five vessels went to Bugia and Alexandria and the children were sold to the Saracens The caliph bought four hundred all clerics among whom there were eighty priests This same caliph had form erly studied at Paris in the garb of a cleric Eighteen of the children were tortured to death because they refused to renounce their Chris tian faith but not one of the others became an apostate One of the clerics escaped and reported these facts and added that eighteen years after the expedition the ruler of Alexandria still held 700  no longer infants but men of ripe age  It is a satisfaction to learn from this account that the two merchants were detected in other villainy and hung29 This story rests upon the evidence of the one clerk who claimed to have returned and is full of manifest improb abilities such as the facts that eighty of the infants were priests and that the Moslems tortured the children to make them apostatize Other later writers repeat some of these statements and add some accounts of miracles but not one chronicle mentions the band of children at any place between Paris and Marseilles And not a single chronicle written south of the Loire mentions the movement at all It is very clear that the contemporaries were right and that the children returned home after marching around and singing in processions for a time For the German children the material is more ample anid their undertaking may well be called a crusade It is true that no one of the chroniclers deplicts ithe whole movement and that each one can be trusted only for a few facts But several entirely independent writers give separate dates and geographical indications which dove tail neatly and enable us to follow some portions of the crusade with great accuracy and furthermore they corroborate one another with regard to some details The best of these accounts were written at 28 M Paris Chron Maj ed Luard II 556 cf preface p x 29 MGSS XXIII 893The Childrens Crusade 521 Cologne30 Treves31 Spires32 Marbach33 in Alsace

years after I2I2 or else contain statements which suggest that the account was given by an eyewitness Neglecting for the pres ent the many other less valuable accounts the story of the expedi tion can be reconstructed from these nine or ten independent sources The leader of the German movement was a boy from Cologne named Nicholas 39 where it began is uncertain although possibly it was in or near the Rhine valley40 The year was I2I241 and probably the time was between Easter and Pentecost42 The participants are said to have been very numerous43 and to have come from a wide extent of territory44 There were men and women boys and girls43 even balbes at the breasts 46 the majority were young and appear to have been mainly from the agricultural classes as it is recorded that they left their ploughs carts or herds47 and hastened to join the bands which were marching through the country Some evil men and women were attracted by the excitement or by the opportunity for plunder and vice48 Just when and where the various bands49 came together and marched under the leadership of Nicholas cannot be ascertained buit there seems to have been only one company when they first entered Italy and proceeded to Genoa 30 Two separate accounts  Cont II iMIGSS XXIV I7I8  Cont III ibid XVII 826 Less trustworthy than some of the others 31 MGSS XXIV 398399 32 Ibid XVII 84 33 Ibid p

a cross in the shape of a Greek Tau but the chronicler at Treves says it was not easy to tell what it was made of The pilgrimage was looked upon with favor by the people except possibly the parents and friends5 and food was gladly given to the children Opposition on the part of some of the clergy was attributed ito their jealousy52 Their general route was up the Rhine valley over the Alps and down into Italy 53 their presence is mentioned at Spires through which some of them probably passed on July 2554 and at Piacenza which Nicholas reached on August 20 or 2 I5 On Saturday August 25 they arrived at Genoa where in the opinion of good men the pilgrims numbered more than seven thousand men women boys and girls 56 On the following Sunday they left the city but many men women boys and girls of their number remained at Genoa57 Some are said to have gone to Marseilles58 others to  Vieneiam which is a city near the sea and there some were taken on board vessels and carried off by pirates to be sold to the Saracens 59 still others vent to Brindisi where the bishop detecting the plot did not permit them to embark for they had been sold to the heathen by the father of Nicholas60 Evidentlv from these accounts the band was breaking up and seeking at various ports to cross over to the Holy Land61 When they first entered Italy they had all declared  with one heart and one voice that they would pass through the seas on dry land and would recover the Holy Land and Jerusalem 62 Finally all seem to have become discour aged many perished of hardships hunger and thirst in the forests 50 Ogerius  51 Chron reg Colon Cont II 52 Ann Marbac 53 Cf  Chron reg Colon Cont II It is possible that there were various bands which followed different routes Some of the statements in the chronicles written in parts of Germany remote from the Rhine valley can be understood more easily by this hypothesis but the indications are too scanty to justify its assertion 54 Ann Spir MGSS XVII

undertaking went to Rome65 and the young children and old people were released from their vow to go on a crusade the others were not freed but were allowed to post ponie the fulfillment of their vow The few who returned home went back ignominiously singly or in little groups silently and sadly The people who had so gener ously supplied their wants on their triumphant progress now turned a deaf ear to their entreaties anid pointed in derision at the maidens wvho had gone forth as virgins and now returned in shame66 It is recorded that Nicholas afterwards fought bravely at Acre and in the siege of Damietta and returned unharmed67 Naturally the imagination of the contemporaries seized upon the obscurity attending the end of the movement and fanciful accounts and explanations were soon believed The most interesting of the tales invented to account for the origin of the crusade ascribed it to the desire of the Old Man of the Mountains to obtain a choice band of young warriors68 R6hricht in the account already mentioned connects the tale of the Pied Piper of Hamelin with the Childrens Crusade He states that the original of the tale is dated in 1284 and that it records that the ratcatcher by magic attracted hundreds of children to follow him He thinks that it is significant that the legend after relating the disappearance of the children in the moun tain nmakes them reappear on the Road of Charles the Great the traditional route of crusaders on their way to the Holy Land69 While this crusading movement is of comparatively little impor tance it is of great interest for the light which it throws upon the mental attitude of the contemporaries Many of the statements which have been quoted from the chronicles illustrate this It must also be remembered that somewhat similar undertakings by children are recorded in I237 and in I45870 It is easy to understand why the 63 Chron reg Colon Cont III G4  Ann Admunt 65  Chron reg Colon Cont II Ann Marbac 66 Chron

and the favorable opinion of the crusade apparently held by learned clerics One writer puts into the mouth of the great Innocent III the exclamation  These children put us to shame because while we

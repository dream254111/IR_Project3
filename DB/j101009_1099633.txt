with reference to CONTENTS should be addressed to the EDITOR at University Station Charlottesville Va BUSINES communications to the PUB LISHERS IN the recent case of Burt v Union Central Life Insurance Co 23 Sup Ct 139 the rather novel question was presented as to whether under a life policy of which the estate of the insured was the beneficiary a recovery may be had where the insured was capitally executed under a conviction of murder and there was no clause in the policy invalidating it for that cause It was held that no recovery could be had In the same case the plaintiffs offered evidence to prove that the conviction of murder was wrongful and not justified by the testi monybasing their right to contradict the judgment of conviction on the ground that the judgment was not conclusive as to them since they were not parties to the criminal prosecution The court held however that although not barred of any right by the prin ciple of res judicata it was contrary to public policy to permit in surance against a miscarriage of justice which would be sanctioned by permitting the impeachment of the judgment of conviction A CONTRADICTION of the proverb that what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander is presented in the recent case of Hartford Fire Ins Co v Wilson 23 Sup Ct 189 The court held a few months ago in Northern Assurance Co v Grandview etc Assoc 183 U S 308 contrary to the view prevail ing in the majority of the State courts that the familiar clause in fire policies prohibiting proof of stipulations conditions or waivers of any kind unless indorsed in writing on the policy must if brought home to the insured be complied with and that no oral stipulation contrary to the terms of the policy could be set up by the assured In the principal case the situation was reversed Here the insurance company undertook to show that a policy com plete on its face and delivered to the insured was in fact delivered on an oral condition not fulfilled The insured relied on the former1903 EDITORIAL 749 ruling in Northern Assurance etc Co v Grandview etc Assoc and maintained that proof of the oral unindorsed condition should be excluded The lower court excluded the proof accordingly hold ing that while it is well settled that written contracts including insurance policiessee Catt v Oliver 6 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER 465 and note are subject to oral proof of conditional delivery yet in this case such proof was excluded by the express language of the policy as construed in the former case But this view was overruled on appeal and it was held that the terms of the policy did not exclude and were not meant to exclude oral proof of conditions the performance of which was precedent to the existence of the contract that the provisions of the policy on this subject were meant to become operative only in case the policy itself became operative as an executed contract and hence such provisions did not exclude parol evidence to establish the fact that no complete contract ever existed between the parties THE famous Syrup of Figs case to which allusion has here tofore been made has at last reached a final decision in the Supreme Court of the United States Clinton E Worden  Com pany v California Fig Syrup Co 23 Sup Ct 161 In the original effort by the Fig Syrup Company to protect itself against infringements it laid claim to the term Fig Syrup or Syrup of Figs as a trade mark The defense met this by the contention obviously sound that the words were de scriptive and could not be exclusively appropriated as a trade mark In response the plaintiff let the cat completely out of the bag by replying that while the terms seemed to be descriptive they were not so in fact since the essential ingredients of the preparation were senna leaves and sugar and that there was little or no fig syrup in it Fatal admission If that be true rejoined the defense then deceit is being practised on the public and you are asking a court of equity to assist you in enjoying a monopoly in the fraud You have not come in with clean hands Right you are said the court and the plaintiff went thereof without day with a decree against it for the defendants costs about their suit in that behalf expended After suffering several similar reverses in the lower Federal courts with affirmances in the Circuit Court of Appeals the plain tiff company finally succeeded in convincing the Federal court in750 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb its home State of California that it was entitled to continue to practise the fraud as a monopoly and curiously enough secured an affirmance of this decree in the Circuit Court of Appeals of that circuit But it is a far cry from California to Washington and but one Californian is on the bench of the Supreme Court Seven of the learned justices concurred in the opinion of iMr Justice Shiras reversing the findings of the Circuit Court of Appeals and remanding the case with directions to dismiss the billthe court agreeing with the conclusion reached by the other Federal courts that the use of the name Syrup of Figs in con nection with a preparation which had no fig syrup in it was a fraud on the public toward the continued perpetration of which a court of equity would not lend its aid Mr Justice McKenna of California dissented The California Fig Syrup Company may at least take comfort from the circumstance that its home judges were faithful to the end SINCE Mr Bryans article on the subject of attachments against national banks published ante p 327 the Court of Appeals of New York in Reed v Peoples Na t Bank Jan 20 1903 28 N Y L J 1639 has again given full consideration to the question as applicable to solvent national banks and again denies the right of attachment whether the bank be solvenit or insolventfollowing its previous ruling in Bank of Montreal v Fidelity Nat Bank 112 N Y 667 which in turn was based on the authority of Pacific Nat Bank v Mixter 124 U S 721 Besides these the following additional cases are cited as supporting the decision Freeman ilMfg Co v Nat Bank of the Republic 160 Mass 398 Planters Loan  Sav Bank v Berry 91 Ga 264 First Nat Bank of Kas son v La Due 39 Minn 415 Dennis v First Nat Bank of Seattle 127 Cal 453 Stafford v First Nat Bank of Plattsburg 61 Vt 373 Rosenhein Real Estate Co v Southern Nat Bank 46 S W Tenn 1026 Garner v Second Nat Bank of Providence 66 Fed 369 The point was made in the principal case that the provisions of Rev Stat sec 5242 prohibiting attachments against national banks had been qualified by the Act of Congress of July 12 1882 22 U S Stat at Large ch 290 see 4 of which provides that the rights and privileges as well as the duties and liabilities of any1903 EDITORIAL 751 banking association extending the period of its succession in ac cordance with the act are preserved with this proviso That the jurisdiction for suits hereafter brought by or against any associa tion established under any law providing for national banking associations except suits between them and the United States or its officers and agents shall be the same as and not other than the jurisdiction for suits by or against banks not organized under any law of the United States which do or might do banking business where such national banking associations may be doing business when such suits may be begun And all laws and parts of laws of the United States inconsistent with this proviso be and the same are hereby repealed It was argued that if the defendant had been a foreign state bank with funds in New York the courts of that State might have acquired jurisdiction by an attachment and hence that the same jurisdiction existed over the funds of a foreign national bank The couit declined to adopt this view however since it is mani festly violative of the spirit of all the legislation on the subject when read as a whole We agree said the court with the Appellate Division that the Act of 1882 was intended to prescribe the forum for litigations by and against national banks and does not relate to provisional remedies to be had in such actions It was designed to prescribe the place where and the courts in which such actions may be prosecuted but it was not intended to regulate the procedure in such actions when brought Nor we might add continued the court was it intended to so regulate the method of commencing an action as to enable a State court to ac quire jurisdiction over the property of a national bank without acquiring jurisdiction of the bank itself THE rights of members of a communistic society were recently the subject of consideration by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Schwartz v Duss decided October 27 1902 The questions raised were entirely aside from the beaten paths of the law in point of novelty and interest The society in question was the famous Harmony Society of Economy Pennsylvania founded about 1804 by one George Rapp who with his son and others came from the kingdom of Wurtemburg to the United States Its members were associated by the common belief that the government of the patriarchal age united to the community752 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb of property adopted in the days of the apostles would conduce to promote their temporal and eternal happiness The cardinal principle of the society was selfabnegation A formal contract modified in later years in accordance with the changed conditions and desires of the members was entered into among themselves by which each subscriber thereto delivered up renounced and remitted for himself his heirs and descendants all of his or her property of every kind as a free gift or donation for the benefit and use of the community They further pledged obedience and submission to the society and agreed never to demand any reward for labor or services which they declared should be a voluntary service for our bretheren In consideration of this renunciation and dedi cation Rapp and his associates promised to supply the subscriber with all the necessaries of life in health or sickness youth or old age and to provide for the subscribers family after his death A provision in the first contract for the refunding to withdrawing members of the value of the property brought in by them was stricken out in 1836 and another adopted by which all agreed to part finally and irrevocably with their contributions that with drawing members or the heirs of deceased members shall be en titled to claim nothing from the society as a matter of right though the superintendent might in his discretion make what allowance he should choose as a donation This agreement was pronounced by the Supreme Court of Penn sylvania to be unobjectionable in law policy or morals Schriber v Rapp 5 Watts 351 30 Am Dec 327 and its validity was not questioned by the Federal Supreme Court in Baker v Nachtieb 19 How 126 and other cases In the course of years owing to the wise management of its officers and the industry and exemplary conduct of the members the property of the society increased enor mously in value but one by one the members died until at the time of the suit they were only eight in number six of them women aged or ignorant Practically Duss was the last sur vivor and as such claimed the ownership of the entire estate Schwartz and Koterba as children of parties to the original agreement filed their bill in equity alleging that if the property had ever been imprsssed with a trust which they denied such trust had wholly ceased and the assets of the association which they further alleged had been further dissolved by its merger with a corporation entirely foreign in nature to the spirit of the original1903 EDITORIAL 753 and amended agreements reverted to the donors thereof whose rights survived to their children The Supreme Court overruled this contention and held that the adoption of the plan was not the creation by the members of a trust in the property for the benefit of the society as such which on the doctrine of resulting trusts conferred on the descendants of members who had contributed no property but only labor and services any such proprietary right or trust as to entitle them to share in its property or have an accounting Mr Justice Gray and Mr Justice Shiras took no part in the decision Mr Chief Justice Fuller with whom concurred Mr Justice Brewer dissented in an opinion the spirit of which is con tained in the following extracts It is inconceivable that the creators of the trust contemplated any such result when they sought to perpetuate Christian fellow ship by the renunciation of their property The titles held by the trustees in this case were held for the benefit and use of the society in the maintenance of its principles When the purposes of the trust failed the property reverted not because of special provision to that effect but because that was the result of the termination of the trusts The judgment in the case is certainly encouraging to members of clubs and social and fraternal organizations to admit no new members but simply persevere

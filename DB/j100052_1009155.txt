of Social Progress No I33 He said My paper will be an elaboration of the following propositions First all rational human life is a product of social conditions and all ethical personality conceived as a well unified selfconscious mental life harmonious within itself and capable of indefinite expansion is a product of those social conditions that we call progress Ethical doctrine can be worked out therefore only in terms of a theory of social progress Second all social progress costs something There can be no developmental increase and transformation of human activities except at the price of an absolute increase of social evils that involve suffering though if the progress is real the absolute will not be also a relative or proportionate augmentation of evil More over these costs of progress are unequally distributed The good of those who gain in material and moral wellbeing is bought with vicarious suffering Third a rapid rate of social change especially an extreme intensity of industrial activity exceeding the rate of creative reorganization necessarily magnifies social evil and converts much of it into moral evil The end would be social disintegration but for a reaction which sets in The ethical consciousness of the 627Ioo ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY community is aroused and unified A public and private philanthropy is created and tends towards a unified policy Fourth but all such reform or philanthropic work is itself a phase of progress and like all other phases has its cost in effort and suffering Therefore if philanthropic reform is hurried or pursued by too radical methods it may convert the absolute increase of evil which progress costs into a relative increase and so wholly defeat itself The demonstration of these propositions is twofold They are corollaries of mental and physical laws of the conser vation of energy and the conditions of evolution They are verified by historical and statistical facts The suffering which progress costs is incidental to the destruction of valued relationships of property and of occupations made neces sary by social growth and change The essential fallacy of socialism is the assumption that these destructive changes might be prevented in a developing world Poverty there fore can never wholly disappear because men and women can never be alike creative resourceful versatile and so capable of quick readjustment to changing conditions Great numbers of men and women will always be practically unfree not legal slaves as in former times but actually subject to task work under mastership Ancient slavery was not a product of tyrannical oppression it was the only economic disposition that could be made of those elements of the pop ulation that has failed in the first great creative tasks of civilization The men and women in economic bondage today are miserable because the only services they know how to render have ceased to be of value in a civilization which is moving on to new methods and larger achievements Society does not oppress them it tries in crude imperfect ways to utilize and support them Socialism could only substitute the public for the individual master  It does not follow that laissez faire is the last word of social science nor that society has no moral responsibility for the costs of its own advancement Under the intense strain of modern competition due to the accelerating rate of 628MINUTES 101 social change population is concentrating in cities faster than wholesome conditions can be created and millions of ignorant people are entering upon migrations that have no definite destination Under such circumstances the strug gle for success results in an appalling moral wreckage Statisticians have long recognized that suicide is a phenome non of civilization Mendsley finds in the extreme passion for getting rich a chief predisposing cause of moral degen eracy and insanity in offspring Crime is no longer attrib uted by the wellinformed to poverty since rich and poor contribute in proportion to their numbers to the total crimi nal population What then is the ethical duty of individuals and of society  It is first of all to admit frankly that in progres sive society one portion of the community should be regarded practically as in Christian doctrine as free from the law while another portion is under bondage to the law  because the one is creative resourceful capable of selfmastery and selfdiscipline while the other can be made useful comfort able and ultimately free only by being brought under mas tership and discipline for a time We habitually ignore this distinction in all matters save the separation of the criminal from the law abiding We accept laissez faire as good for all men and all industries alike or denounce it as bad for all alike We advocate socialistic methods for the entire field of industry or pronounce them impracticable for any part We denounce compulsory education for any class in the community or insist upon forcing it by state machinery on all classes In all this we confound distinct things and show ourselves irrational in the last degree This paper was discussed by Rev S D McConnell DD Rev William I Nichols and Mr Hugo Bilgram Dr McConnell said  With the latter part of the paper I am in almost entire accord With the fundamental thesis that the ethical faculty in man is a faculty which has been developed in the course of ages by the interaction of individual human beings upon each other in society I am 629102 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY not sure that I agree That the ethical faculty has been produced in this way that it has no sanction except what comes from that source the recollection of utilities in the pastis this true  I for myself do not think it is true I believe right here is an area in which evolutionists have unadvisedly set up their flag The attempt to express all the phenomena of conscience another way of saying ethics in terms of social order is as essentially unscientific as it would be to attempt to express intellectual processes in terms of physics That they are very intimately joined together that they act and react upon each other is beyond all ques tion The expression of the intellectual faculty is condi tioned upon the physical nature the expression of the ethical faculty is conditioned upon the social order Those who are unable to conceive of the mind as an entity dis tinguishable from the body are the same persons who cannot conceive of the ethical faculty as separate from the social order It has been said there is nothing in the intellect which was not previously in the senses except the intellect itself It might with equal truth be said there is nothing in the ethical faculty which was not in the social order except the faculty itself It is true that the action and the reaction of the ethical faculty upon the social organism has to an enormous extent modified them both but the thing which cannot be explained in terms of the social organism is the faculty itself The weakness of the theory is the impossibility of establishing it I believe it is possible to show the absolute independence in function of the ethical faculty from the social organism as Mr Fiske has shown the absolute independence in function of the understanding from the brain They move in correlated lines but that the relation of cause and effect subsists between them I do not believe  To refer conscience to social progress as a cause is to empty it of all binding force The practical objection to the whole way of thinking upon which this paper is based is that it provides no sufficient motive If the distinction 630MINUTES 103 between right and wrong is one which rests ultimately on human experience and has no sanction except the good of society then I am constrained to feel toward society as did another about posterity What has posterity ever done for me that I should do for posterity If the sanctions of the conscience are to be sought for solely in social experience and in the good or evil which will flow from my actions to the social order that will serve me very well so long as I need neither motive nor restraint  I was deeply interested in the distinction between integ rity and utility which the essayist made keeping himself to the etymological force of the words But he drew therefrom what seems to me a false conclusion that wherever conflict arises utility must go to the wall because the mans sense of integrity of wholeness will compel him to stand up for his integrity at the sacrifice of utility But utility always masquerades as integrity The distinction which is drawn is not valid outside of the closet in everyday life  It is more true that social progress is due to ethics than the reverse I was deeply interested in the essayists treat ment of the continuity of moral evil he does not expect that evil will disappear from the world I could not help thinking that there was a confusion in the argument which so clearsighted a man would not have fallen into but for his as it seems to me false premises If there is no sanction and no ground for ethical faculty or rule except in social progress the stream can never rise higher than its fount The vice of this whole way of thinking seems to me to be that students of ethics are not compelled to deal with ethical problems in the concrete but only in the abstract The fundamental thesis seems to me without motive power This conception of ethics might produce a Plato or perhaps a John the Baptist it could not produce a St Paul and a Sister of Charity is a fool in the presence of it  But ethical progress has always outrun the material or social progress of the world The moral progress of the 63 Io4 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY century now drawing to a close has been fivefold as great as either the physical or material progress The moral judg ment of a gallery god at a theatre in Philadelphia tonight is a more accurate moral judgment than that of many a philosopher of the last century an accurate ethical standard has been generally diffused He was followed by Rev William I Nichols who said   Society exists not for itself alone but also exists for the individual and in that sense we may say that morality is the result of social progress It seems to me that the keynote of the address is that social progress involves cost and we cannot have anything without paying for it I think that that law which goes through all society applies also in the matter of civilization and with knowledge there does come increase of evil I agree with the essayist again that we cannot expect the elimination of evil or suffering from the world but we can make indefinite progress  Then it was said by the last speaker that moral progress has been far greater than social progress I understand that there has been vast progress in morality Still I feel that we who attempt to be leaders of morality ought to feel put to shame by those great men who have been leaders in the material progress of the world the relative improve ment in the moral standard has been far less than could be expected  I agree with the address throughout except perhaps as to the matter of immigration The essayist seemed to think that each nation ought to bear the burden of its own evil I feel that we cannot shut ourselves up and feel that we are simply going to enjoy ourselves in this nice island of a Con tinent I believe we have to be ready to accept as a price of our progressive happiness here this cost I do not believe the evils in the nation can be attributed to the immi grants they come here and find the evils that cause them to be dangerous We should take away from them the dangerous weapon of strong drink that makes them a 632MINUTES 105 menace to society I believe this is part of our mission to be uplifters of those who come to us  No people have a right to live in luxury in one part of a city or country and let the wretched go their miserable way While I agree with the suggestions of the essayist and believe them to be excellent I think he fell just short of the highest and best remedy This remedy is the expression of a Chris tian spirit that those who are strong ought to be willing to bear the infirmities of the weak We are all members one of another I believe we shall go on making indefinite pro gress in proportion as we make men believe this  Time was when the strongest men physically were kings and rulers No longer do we gain by physical superiority but by mental power But this does not give us the right to use whatever privileges we have acquired to the injury of others Nothing is ours to keep all things are ours only to elevate mankind We are always compelled to come back to those principles set forth so sweetly and beautifully in the ethics of the New Testament  these are the principles that make for the moral regeneration of the universe SEVENTEENTH SESSION The Seventeenth Scientific Session of the Academy was held in Philadelphia on Thursday January 12 I893 at the Drexel Institute at 8 P M The secretary announced that the following papers had been submitted to the Academy since its last session 134 By Ellis Paxson Oberholtzer Norristown Pa Home Rule for our American Cities 135 By E V Robinson Schoolcraft Mich The Nature of the Federal State 136 By L S Merriam

Wright Cleveland O A Study of the South ern Mountain Population 145 By Horace White New York City National and State Banks Printed in the current number of the ANNALS Professor E J James then introduced Mr Horace White editor of the New York Evening Post who read the principal paper of the evening on National and State Banks No 145 Hon William L Trenholm exComptroller of the Cur rency was then introduced by the President He said in substance  There can be no doubt as to the soundness of the princi ples set forth in Mr Whites paper Unfortunately in our country there are a great many people who have not studied the subject and they are not all of them outside of the two Houses of Congress It is not to be expected that the rep resentatives of a free people should as a rule know very much more on any subject than the average of their constituents and therefore if we find a great many members of both Houses who have failed to study this question we are entitled to consider that this is because in the constituency from which they come there is a decided majority who have themselves not studied it either and therefore who find it no disadvantage to their own interests in being represented in Congress by those ignorant of the subject Now when I said that there were those in Congress who had not studied this question I did not mean by that to cast a reflection upon any member of that body We must re 634JMINUTES 107 member that these monetary questions have come up recently Nearly all the members of Congress in both Houses have obtained their prominence upon other issues Therefore while it is an unfortunate thing for the country that it does not come in the way of most of the influential statesmen to investigate the subject fully it cannot be made a reproach to them for not having done so But there is one way in which the people can make their repre sentatives study this matter and that is by taking it up themselves And if there is any question which touches every man woman and child in this country more nearly than any other it is the question as to what sort of money we are going to be dependent upon for carrying on our busi ness and obtaining the fruits of our labor The people of the United States are an industrial people There is no population of equal size in the world in which there are so many actively engaged in industrial pursuits or so many who are dependent wholly upon those who are thus engaged Whether it is in manual labor or labor in directing or in the application of capital it is all industrial effort The vast industrial products of this country must be ex changed and transported  and banks must be managed by which these exchanges and transportations are alone ef fected Now that which promotes all this great machinery of industry is the money that is in circulation among the people As long as that money is absolutely good in the estimation of those who receive it and pay it out the whole machine proceeds without jar or creaking But if there is doubt in the minds of the public as to whether the dollar they take today is going to bring them back as much in value to morrow or next week as they are giving for it in their labor or their property or their products then there is an obstruction an interruption to the progress of industry and as the number of those who have this doubt increases so do the points multiply at which friction arises and a retard ing of the whole industrial machinery results 6351Io8 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY It has been fortunate that during the time covered by the experience of most of those who are now living and carry ing on this great industrial machine that the money that we have had has been all good money It is true that up to 1879 the greenback and the National banknote was not worth as much as gold coin and the gold notes of the country because there was at that time a depreci ation of the paper currency It was not felt however as a very serious inconvenience among the people at large because there was a general confidence that it only required a certain amount of time to enable so great and prosperous and intelligent a people as this to bring its currency up to its full intrinsic value in gold but the process by which that end was accomplished was a costly and tedious one and between the time that the Resumption Act was passed and the time at which resumption was actually accomplished all industry was more or less hampered all credit more or less curtailed and to use a familiar expression Times were hard It was a long steep hill up which the country had to toil from the low level of a depreciated currency to the high honest level of a currency equal in value to its nominal gold equivalent Now that experience should make us very uneasy as to anything that threatens to disturb the present position of our currency on the gold level If it should fall again as it did during the war we shall have that same tedious hill to climb because there is a commercial necessity there is a natural law stronger than any statutes we ever passed stronger than the whole of our community which makes it an absolute necessity that a great commercial nation like this must have its money of the best that is obtainable or else it must suffer intolerable inconvenience and burdens We are in danger of letting down the gold standard and every man and every woman in this country should if pos sible be made to understand that if this happens it will cost us years of sacrifice years of toil years of tribulation to get back to it 636MINUTES o09 This is considered a dry subject by those who look at it only from a speculative point of view but it is a subject of the profoundest interest to those who will once satisfy themselves that the future of what they possess as individu als and families  the value of what they are going to leave behind them to their children will depend upon the legisla tion of Congress in respect to this monetary question A life insurance policy a pension derived from the Govern ment an investment in lands a permanent salary an annuity under a bequest may all be reduced in value by inconsiderate and improper legislation A man who has labored sacrificed and stinted himself to leave some thing to his children must find that that little which he leaves them is greatly reduced in value because of a law passed by Congress to which he gave very little attention at the time The money that we use measures the value of everything we do and everything we possess If that money is itself of constant value then we know that the dollars that have cost us so many days labor will save our children a like num ber of days labor or what is equivalent will supply them with a like amount of the necessities of life But if by act of Congress or by the failure of Congress to act the dollars that we are now toiling for and are putting into property by which our labor and our sacrifices are measured hereafter fall to a lower value then our children will get less although they may get the same number of dollars That is the thing that we have to keep in our minds that is the thing we have to explain to those whom we desire to influence  that is the thing that if brought home to every man and every woman will impress itself strongly on their minds It is not the dollars that we work for it is the dollars worth Now if you let Congress reduce the value of that dollar you will all be having your labor your income your efforts whatever they may be professional or otherwise measured by a false weight a false value or measured by false rules and you will all suffer 637I 10 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY There are men whose situation in life whose experience in business whose opportunities are such as to enable them to take advantage of a depreciating currency and become rich while the rest of the community are becoming poor but those are not the masses of the community those are not the farmers the artisans the clerks the hardworking profes sional men who have no time for these considerations who are intent only upon doing their quota of work and obtain ing the recompense for it They may go on month after month receiving their pay in a depreciated currency without knowing it is depreciated and depreciating The bankers and astute men will know and they will take measures by which they will indemnify themselves against the deprecia tion The people must suffer the losses and bear the burdens and then when the bottom is reached the hill has to be climbed again The experienced can take care of themselves the masses are those who will be irretrievably injured by Congress therefore if we want to prevent this we must get at the masses who vote for members of Congress and urge them not to allow their Representatives to remain ignorant upon so important a subject The President saidThe discussion will be continued by Hon Michael D Harter of Ohio Mr Harter spoke in substance as follows In regard to most of the things that have been said I sympathize very closely indeed with the principal speaker of the evening It could scarcely be otherwise from the fact that I have been in many ways a kind of humble disciple of Mr White since the year 1872 and yet I cannot help feeling as a practical banker that possibly another course is easier of adoption would appeal more strongly to the country today and can be ren dered more quickly effectual The great difficulty in dealing with a question like this in practical legislation is that owing to the composition of Congress and it is no reflection upon that body made up  Compare Mr Harters paper in the current number of the ANNALS 638MINUTES III as it is almost exclusively of professional men with a sprinkling only of business men this kind of subject can not be approached and the dictates of logic followed as they might be followed either in an assembly made up of phil osophers and students of this subject or in a bank parlor filled with men who had had many years of practical and theoretical experience in this branch of business You discover the kind of ignorance referred to in the most unexpected quarters For instance just at this moment in the minds of most people the vital question is how shall the purchase of silver with the public credit be quickly stopped  If you have followed the utterances of distinguished public men you have probably observed that in speaking of the difficulty of repealing such portions of the Sherman act as provide for the purchase of silver bullion they invariably wind up their remarks by saying it would be a contraction measure and so far no substitute has been provided for it Now so long as it is impossible for the leading legislators of the country to understand how the stoppage of silver pur chases at this time would become an inflation measure of the most wholesome character rather than one of contraction we see the practical difficulties which lie in the path of the wisest action Therefore we come to the conclusion that that which is nearest at hand should be adopted provided there are no great objections to it In this country and in the world at large there are several systems of banking The one outlined by Mr White is almost identical with that of our neighbors in Canada and in speaking of this it would only be a eulogy perhaps on the system recommended by Mr White to say that the system in our sister country has been a very successful one indeed The French system is under the immediate control of the Government in a way which is not practicable in a country so extended as ours where legislative action is so extremely slow when it is most necessary it should be speedy Hence any system of banking which we may adopt for general use 639112 ANNALS OF THIE AMERICAN ACADEMY must not depend for its safety on anything important or essen tial which implies prompt action by Congress You have an example of it just now The people those in business life at any rate consider that the present course of buying a large quantity of silver bullion every month which we do not need is tending towards bankruptcy towards a crisis towards commercial distress towards disaster in business circles and disaster in every home yet you see how slowly Congress moves even under these circumstances When the men in the country are assured of a crisis and when they can feel the tremor of the coming earthquake how impossi ble it is to induce Congress under these serious circumstances to take any quick prompt action upon this question There fore I say we must have a banking system when it is once finally adopted which will under any circumstances permit of prompt positive relief Now I am one of those who believe to the fullest extent and in the heartiest manner possible that if we were to provide any facilities for the increase of banking circula tion but made no provision for the increase of money circulating in trade we should always have enough and the very best kind of money for all purposes Our goods would be sold and as Mr White says would bring to the country the best kind of money in the world The earlier some action can be taken on the banking system the better but it seems to me that no head way can be made in Congress until we can point to a banking system as a source from which the circu lation of the country can be increased You must understand in this kind of legislation that we are obliged to meet the conditions as they exist before you can get a great body of men in Congress to favor continuously at any rate any kind of wise legislation You must provide a banking system which does promise to supply the money infallibly when it is needed You will remember when we undertook to reduce the Greenback circulation from four hundred millions at the very 640MINUTES I13 moderate rate of four millions a monthwhich was done by Sec retary McCullough before we had proceeded eleven months the people of the United States stopped the operation The result is our progress in that direction produced a reduction of only fortyfour millions of dollars And this point is con stantly urged Therefore I say it is very essential in this matter that we should make some progress in the direction of a banking system which the country will deem sufficient and which will go on developing furnishing the people good money which the business interests of the country de mand Now we cannot reach that quicker than by follow ing as closely as may be the system established in 1838 in New York and afterwards copied by all or nearly all of the banking systems of the country because this system has the unlimited confidence of the people of the country It is very easy to supplement that which we have already in operation and how shall we do that I think everybody agrees with me that at this time the question of bank legis lation would in no sense be a burning one if a supply of Government bonds were to remain upon which to base the circulation The question is whether government bonds cannot be supplemented If they can be it seems to me that the whole question is solved Confessedly if a government bond could be carried on favorable terms in unlimited quantities there would be no question of the purchase of silver or any artificial methods of increasing the currency It seems to me a class of securities adapted to the pnrpose is right at hand This country is rich in collateral securities for banking circulation and competent men can throw such necessary safeguards around them as to remove from them all their danger Let me speak then of a kind of securities which every body is more or less familiar with one that is in all respects as good as those which the Government has issued Nor would these securities for the purpose of maintaining 641114 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY the banking circulation excite prejudice against the national banks This would break out with tenfold more force if it were seriously proposed either to in crease or continue the debt of the United States in order that bankers might profit by it It would not suf fice to allay the prejudice of the country if you were to point out that the very low rate of interest put on the United States bonds left no considerable profits to the banks The class of bonds I allude to are those of the railway companies the best securities in existence in the world I have never been a believer in the idea that the ultimate securities of a bank note should be based upon either gold or silver the current security the power to redeem it day by day and the power of continual redemption which should go on should be based upon gold of course But the ultimate redemption of a bank note ought not to depend upon gold or silver deposited as security for the note because that becomes the most wasteful kind of security and the most unprofitable because it locks up funds which could be profitably employed in the active business of the country It is not so with the bond bearing interest if that bond is laid aside for security for circulation it does not diminish in value or earning power and therefore it becomes the choicest kind of security Suppose that this had been the law can you not judge the future by the past Since 1865 you have had bank after bank failing and bank ruptcy after bankruptcy under your railroad act you have had reorganization after reorganization and vast sums have been lost in these enterprises and investments but if these secur ities under such restrictions as this had been adopted from 1863 and had continued down to this day with the United States as endorsers upon the bank note circulation for the people as holders of this circulation the people would not have lost a penny But there is a step further we could stop here but the people represented in Congress are unwilling they say we are not content with a national system we are not content 642MINUTIES 115 with a tax law upon the statute books which was not in tended for revenue which was intended to oppress the busi ness interest in the various States which was intended to give the central Government control over what rightfully belongs to the State Government This is a potent factor in the arguments used by a majority of the Representatives in Congress  they are not content to increase the kinds of secur ities which may be deposited for the security of circulating notes of National Banks They demand that the tax be taken off from the State Bank circulation Now the fact is a majority of these people would I believe be content to see a removal of that tax with a condition and that condition would be that notes of State Banks should be secured in the same manner as those of the National Banks were by law secured The present House is not willing and it is not at all probable that in the course of a year or two it will be willing to have any restriction whatever placed upon the circulation of State Banks Personally I do not think that it is a very important matter but it seems to alarm a great many people through the country Visions of red dog  stump tail  and shin plaster circulation disturb the people I confess I never had this kind of fear I know it is a wellestablished principle that the Gresham law is as unavoidable as the law of gravitation but it never seemed to me a fair application of the Gresham law to claim that an inferior bank circulation would crowd out a better It is true if both were legal tender and that a creditor were obliged to take either that a debtor presented to him the law would apply with the same force to a more worthless credit which would drive out the other but where two currencies are neither legal tender then the operation of the law is naturally reversed and the better will inevitably drive out the poorer In other words I believe today that if I were given permis sion to open a shop on Chestnut or Fourth Street and if I were authorized to issue circulating notes signed by myself under the present conditions it would not be 6431Si6 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACAD1EMY a very profitable grant to me I scarcely know exactly how I should get those notes beyond my doorstep and if I got them out I do not know of any way in the world by which I could keep them out and remain in Philadelphia There is no danger or not much that you will ever have a large number of State banks under any circumstances issu ing State notes There are three or four reasons for it look ing at it from the point of view of a banker and business man The first is that very few of the States at this time would cumber themselves when an efficient and popular national system was in existence I think very few of the States in the Union would pass laws in conformity with the law of the United States and if they did not their banks would not be enabled to issue money The next reason is a very good business reason It rests on the principle that a large business can be conducted at a smaller expense than a smaller one and the result of this would be that the taxation of banks organized under a national system would be at a lower rate than any other State could fix upon a State bank if they were to be maintained profitably Then thirdly the credit of a national bank would be greater than that of a State bank and the profit on banking especially in circulation depends very largely upon credit and as the credit of the National banks would go arm in arm with the greater profit under the National banking system it naturally follows that State banks would be discouraged There is still another reason which appeals to me as a banker and I think this point has occurred to a great many people in the United States viz the provision which makes the circulating notes of one bank a legal tender not to indi viduals it is true but to other banks And so long as this requirement exists it would secure for the national banks a wider and cheaper circulation and make redemption much more infrequent and therefore less expensive and leave a larger margin of profit As a precedent to organizing a good banking system we ought not to rest until we have established the whole cur 6441MINUTs  I17 rency system of the United States upon gold as the sole standard of value with the determination that the Govern ment when it furnishes the country with a dollar in gold shall aim to put as much gold into it as will sell in the mar ket for a dollar You will provide silver money and subsid iary coin intended for circulation and paper money as well which at all times must be redeemable in gold and without any interest cost or expense to the people I really believe that were gold a standard firmly established it would not be necessary to have any bank circulation I do not believe that a bank note circulation would be an abso lute necessity I believe if you were to once establish the principle that gold was the sole

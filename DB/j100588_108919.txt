Rifled Projectiles By CHARLES W MERRIFIELD FRS Principal of the Royal School of Naval Architecture Received March 19Read April 23 1868 AT the beginning of this month LieutColonel H R HALFORD applied to me to obtain for him the law of atmospheric resistance resulting from his experiments in shooting with METFORDS matchrifle a smallbore with increasing pitch I found the resistance to vary as the cube of the velocity As the calculations and experiments were all made without any notion of the resulting law and without any knowledge of the work already done by Professor HMLJE and Pro fessor BASHFORTH they afford a remarkable confirmation of the results obtained by those gentlemen This is the more worthy of notice as their data belong to pieces of large calibre and mine to smallbore bullets The experimental data originally submitted to me were simply the elevations found necessary to give the different ranges of every 100 yards from 100 to 1100 These were as follows Yards range Elevation 100 9 30 200 20 300 31 30 400 44  500 57 30 600 1 12 700 1 27 30 800 1 44 900 2 130 1000 2 20 1100 2 39 30 I was informed that these were the means derived from a great number of selected trials bad shots being of course discarded The laws of the motion were arrived at tentatively I began the calculations from an assumed velocity of 1360 feet per second which is seen by the shorter ranges to be very nearly true of necessity I then found that the law of the squares did not fit the results at all but that the law of the cubes very nearly did so and a slight alteration in the assumed velocity made them do so with exactness dv The method used was to determine the coefficient of resistance mo in dtenmy which MDCCCLxvIII3444 MR C W MERRIFIELD ON THE LAW OF THE gives m 2tv  s v being the initial velocity s the actual range and 0 the inclina 0 tion The time t was that of the range in vacuo due to the supposed initial velocity and given elevation It was assumed first that the vacuum time might be taken to represent the real time and second that the horizontal resistance might be taken to vary as the cube of the horizontal velocity The result is given in the following

range has no sensible variation thus proving that the facts are exactly met by the law that the resistance varies accord ing to the cube of the velocity with a coefficient of resistance for this particular bullet of 000000 02723 This is subject to the assumptions previously mentioned It is further either involved or assumed that the bullet presents an invariable aspect in a horizontal direction These assumptions are sufficiently right for such a very low trajectory as is given by 2 40 for 1100 yards giving a vacuum height of 64 feet I got out a graphical solution of the resisted time of a bullet thrown with a velocity of 64 feet per second which cor responds to that height and with a coefficient of 0 000001 and I found the variation in time too small to detect in fine curves carefully drawn with ordinates of nearly 2 feet in length I consider this as amounting to proof that the difference between real and vacuum time is insignificant in this problem The second assumption as to the hori zontal resistance varying as the cube of the horizontal velocity is justified by the low trajectory On the question of aspect my present knowledge does not authorize me to form any decided opinionRESISTANCE OF THE AIR TO RIFLED PROJECTILES 445 The graphical method mentioned above was devised to evade the arithmetical difli culties of the question and I hope shortly to be able to publish an account of it Colonel HALFORD has since been so obliging as to communicate to me the following notes of the experimental data These are as follows The means by which the angles of METFORDS matchri1es were arrived at The rifles were shot at 121 yards to get the zero on the tangentscale This distance is taken because with a radius of 12 yards 8 of an inch is one minute of angular space an easy quantity to deal with Corrections made for height of fore sight above axis of bore and for fall of bullet at 12 yards taken as one minute The tangentscale is then carefully cut for radius between the sights to read to minutes with a vernier It can be read to 15 by careful inspection The Table of angles is then made from careful registers of shooting in all weathers but especially calm weather at different distances but chiefly at 200 yards 500 600 800 900 and 1100 yards Nine times out of ten the angles will be found to be perfectly correct i calm weather Difference of barometrical pressure will make a slight difference The Table furnished i e of elevations corresponding to ranges was drawn out by Mr METFORD and has been very heavily tested by myself and tallies exactly with my experience The angles have been compared with those used by other men using similar rifles and have been found to tally making slight allowance for the little differences of speed which different barrels will giveusually not more than is due to 0 2 of elevation in 1000 yards I must have fired from 8000 to 9000 shots I have most of my shots registered I should say that the Tables have been worked out from results given by at least 30000 shots Ranges Elevations Elevations Elevations g Table No1 Table No2 Table No3 Yards 0  O      100 915 9 30 10 30 200 19 30 20 20 30 300 30 45 31 30 32

perfect in itself it is a Table used occasionally with a head wind and has not been so carefully worked out as the others a head wind is so disturbing in its effects that practically it is almost impossible to verify it The other Tables are reliable within very small fractions  This has since appeared in the Philosophical Magazine for June 186S446 ON THE LAW OF THE RESISTANCE OF THE AIR TO

paraboloidal head not pointed These notes were not given to me until after my calculations had been made It will be observed that the data originally supplied and from which I worked are those of Table 2 This appears to be the most reliable being very near the mean of the other two On the whole I consider myself singularly fortunate in having had such a very good series of experiments fromwhich to calculate It will not fail to be noticed that the velocity of sound is intermediate between the initial and final velocities of the bullets at the longer ranges Xote added 3rd August 1868For the sake of comparison with other results I give the reduction of this coefficient of resistance to the standard of one pound weight avoir dupois and one inch transverse section on the doubtful assumption that the coefficient varies inversely as the weight and directly as the transverse section Coefficient reduced to 1 lb weight and to one square inch section 0 00000 01267 Ditto and to one circular inch section 000000 00995

hymenopterous parasites of the family Belytidae by J J Kieffer 47 pp 3 plates MAJOR THOS L CASEY has issued No 1 of a  Memoirs on the Coleoptera 205 pp 1910 This number contains two articles New Spe cies of the Staphylinid Tribe Myrmedoniini and Synonymic and Descriptive Notes on the Pasderini and Pinophilini He has described 365 new species only a very few being identi fied with known forms Most of the species are in the genera Atheta which he divides into many subgeneraSableta Datomicra Colpodota and Strigota Many of the species are from the eastern states MR H B STOUGH is the author of a detailed study of the external morphology of one of the jumping plant lice Besides the structure of the body he takes up the wingvenation and colorpattern He finds that the media and cubitus in nymphal wings are distinctly sepa rate From the structure of mouth and geni talia he concludes that the Psyllidse are more closely related to the Aleurodidae than to any other family of insects DR G ALESSANDRINI has made some experi ments with the larve of Piophila casei known as the cheeseskipper2 These larvae can pass through the digestive tract of man or dog without greatly delaying development In a dog the larvse produced lesions of the intestine which facilitated the entrance of pathogenic germs The larvae can resist the action of many chemical agents but the ultraviolet rays retard development The lifecycle occu pies about fifty days E WASMANN continues his observations on The hackberry Psylla Pachypsylla celtidis m mmcn Riley A Study in Comparative Insect MOrphology Kans

contains the species of Camponotus Formica and Poly ergus There is a large amount of biological matter about each species but the plates which are photographs do not well illustrate the structure of the species THE fifth volume of Theobalds mono graph of the Culicidee or mosquitoes of the world has been issued by the British Museum It contains 646 pp 6 pls and 261 text figures There are 392 species recorded since volume four was issued not many of them new most of the additions are from Africa or Australia none from the United States W WESCHE has made a new subfamily of craneflies the Ceratocheilinae4 It is based on two new genera of small flies from Africa The proboscis is very long and thin with short palpi inserted near its apex the antennae are short and the second joint subglobular The wings are similar to Ptychoptera the claws are simple One genus Ceratocheilus bears peculiar bifid hairs on the legs ABOUT 1892 to 1894 Dr H V Nassonov published in the Russian language several large papers on the curious insects known as Strepsiptera A translation has now been printed in German6 In an appendix is a re view of the literature on the group since Nassonovs

genera Libellula and Perithemis and allied forms Libellula is used in a broad sense including Plathemis and Ladona The forms of Perithemis do mitia are considered as species our common one thus becoming P tenera Say MR F NEERACHER has made many interest ing studies on the insects of the Rhine River that form an instructive paper7 He has found 13 species of Perlidae 19 of Ephemeridae and 31 Trichoptera He gives descriptions of the species and of the larvae of many of them There are notes on male dimorphism length of adult life duration of generations com parative abundance and the date of first ap pearance for three consecutive years He finds that the species with long life as adults appear in the spring while those of a very short life appear in great numbers and in midsummer VOLUME V of  Fauna Arctica Jena 1910 contains two entomological articles one by J C H de Meijere is on Die Dipteren der arktischen Inseln pp 1572 The Nemocera Anthomyidae and Scatomyzidee are numerous but other flies are scarce and but two species of mosquitoes The other article is by B Poppius Die Coleopteren des artischen Ge bietes pp 289447 He considers the tree limit as the southern boundary of the arctic fauna The Carabidae and Staphylinidea are particularly well represented There is a chapter on the geographic distribution of arctic beetles A NEW entomological journal is the Bulletin of Entomological Research apparently a quar terly and devoted to the economic entomology of tropical Africa It is edited by a commit tee of English entomologists and pathologists Mr Guy A Marshall being

published a system of classification of the hemipterous family Capsidse Now he has issued a new arrangement8 He has modified his previous classification in various details and made nine subfamilies He gives a list of the genera placing most of theW in the proper subfamily The article also includes a review of the classi fications of the Heteroptera and a new one in which he arranges the 40 families in 12 superfamilies There are tables to these fam ilies and to the groups of the Oapsidse One of the new features is the elevation of Piesma to family rank NATHAN BANKS SPECIAL ARTICLES THE SELECTIVE ELIMINATION OF ORGANS ONE of the monuments erected to Charles Darwin on the hundredth anniversary of his birth might have been a bibliographic index to the literature of organic evolution But it is very much easier to pen a series of ad dresses on Darwins method Darwins real opinion Darwins influence than it is to com pile a comprehensive bibliography and an alyze it with the thoroughness and detail and wisdom necessary to make it a really useful aid to the investigator it would have taken a very plucky librarian with wealthy friends and a genius for interesting them in his undertakings to carry it through As his card manuscript for the subject in xdex approached completion he would have found that several drawers in his cabinet were required for the cards bearing the cap tion natural selection These cards would have been a key to everything that can be said in a theoretical way about natural se lection The student who would take these cards and attempt conscientiously to cover the field would be ready after a years floun dering about in the morass of rhetoric to be 8 Neue Beitrige zur Phylogenie und System atik derMiriden Acta Soc Soi Fenn XXXVII No 3 1910 pp 171 lieve that all the argumentsfor and against have been presented in all their possible permutations That no solid foundation for a scientific superstructure is to be found in this polemic quagmire has often been recognized at pres ent natural selection is out of fashion among biologists Other problems are in the search light It is quite natural that a theory which has been so much talked about but as little in vestigated should cease to be attractive at a time when concrete experimental proof is so much in demand But can not such proof be adduced for natural selection Is it not pos sible that the biologist of today with the powerful tools of statistical analysis at his service may be able to demonstrate the exist ence of natural selection just as by the use of these tools he has been able to measure the strength of heredity Fortunately a beginning has already been made for if the index were brought well up to date probably over a dozen of the cards in the drawers devoted to natural selection would bear titles of papers embodying the results of serious attempts to measure the intensity of the selective death rate in some organism In the selection theory of evolutionthe pure Darwinian theory as popularly con ceivedthere are three factors which must be not only existent but coexistent if there is to be any shift in the characteristics of suc ceeding generations of any organism These factors are variation inheritance and selective elimination If any one of these be absent or its force counterbalanced by some other fac tor Darwinian evolution in that species can not be taking place at the moment in ques tion Now a great mistake of most of the men who have written on organic evolution has been that they have tried to solve the whole problem Lacking data or having only a modicum of data they have invoked as sumptions and logic and having proved their assumptions by their logic have proceeded to generalizations In dealing with a problem SCIENCE 519

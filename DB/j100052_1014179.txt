J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1014179,A LABOR ATTITUDE TOWARD PRODUCTIONAN ENGLISH POINT OF VIEW,I242680,A LABOR ATTITUDE TOWARD PRODUCTIONAN ENGLISH POINT OF VIEW BY W A APPLETON SECRETARY GENERAL FEDERATION OF TRADE UNIONS ENGLISH PRESIDENT INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF TRADE UNIONS VW HAT DO WE MEAN BY LABOR WHAT IS THE AIM OF PRODUCTION IS MAXIMUM PRODUCTION INJURIOUS TO THE WORKERS ONE HAS ONLY TO READ THE NEWSPAPERS TO LISTEN TO THE POLITICAL ORATORS OR TO STUDY THE ORIGIN AND AIMS OF STRIKES TO REALIZE HOW CONFUSEDLY AND HOW CARE LESSLY MOST MEN THINK ABOUT THESE QUESTIONS ARE THE COMMON CONCEP TIONS CONCERNING THEM JUSTIFIED WHEN WE SPEAK OF LABOR DO WE CONSCIOUSLY MEAN ONLY THAT MANUAL LABOR EMPLOYED UPON A PIECE OF METAL OR A PIECE OF WOOD WHEN WE THINK OF PRODUCTION DO WE CONSIDER ONLY ITS EFFECT UPON THOSE PROFITS WHICH CAN BE STATED IN CASH PERCENTAGES DO WE REALLY REGARD MAXIMUM PRODUCTION AS NECESSARILY CREATING AN UNEMPLOYED AND DEVITAL IZED PROLETARIAT WHAT IS LABOR WHAT IS LABOR THE ANSWER GIVEN BY THE MARXIAN SOCIALIST IS EUPHONIC BUT NOT CONVINCING GRANDILOQUENTLY HE REPLIES THAT LABOR IS THE SOURCE OF ALL WEALTH IS IT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT THE ALMIGHTY HAD LITTLE TO DO WITH THE CREATION OF WEALTH UN LESS THE GEOLOGISTS AND THE PHYSIOGRA PHISTS ARE ALTOGETHER WRONG HE PRECEDED THE CAPITALIST THE MINER THE BRICK MAKER THE CARPENTER AND EVEN THE AGRICULTURALIST THE MARXIAN IS WRONG OF COURSE LABOR IS THE OPERATING FORCE RATHER THAN THE SOURCE OR CREATIVE AGENCY THIS IS PROVED BY THE EXIST ENCE IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD OF IMMENSE RESERVES OF WEALTH WHICH NEITHER CAPITAL NOR LABOR HAVE YET TOUCHED THE EXACT DEFINITION OF A TERM WHICH INCLUDES INFINITE POSSIBILITIES IS DIFFICULT HE WHO ESSAYS DEFINITION MAY INVOLVE HIMSELF IN A MORASS IN MAKING THE ATTEMPT I FULLY REALIZE THE DANGER DEFINITION HOWEVER IS NECESSARY IF CLARITY IS TO BE OBTAINED IT APPEARS TO ME THAT LABOR IS THAT INVENTIVE INITIATIVE CONSTRUCTIVE AND MANIPULATIVE CAPACITY WHICH APPLIED TO MATERIALS CONDITIONS AND REQUIRE MENTS EXTRACTS MAKES AND DISTRIBUTES THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL TO HUMAN EXISTENCE ENLIGHTENMENT AND HAPPINESS SUCH A DEFINITION MAY BE IMPERFECT BUT IT TAKES COGNIZANCE OF THE INVENTIVE LABOR OF A WATTS OR AN EDISON AND THE EFFORTS OF THOSE WHO CONCEIVE BUSINESSES PROVIDE CAPITAL ERECT BUILD INGS ORGANIZE MANIPULATIVE AND TECH NICAL PERSONNEL AND DISCOVER AND EX PLOIT MARKETS IT PROVIDES ALSO A NICHE FOR TECHNICAL STAFFS FOR SALESMEN AND AGENTS IT RECOGNIZES MANUAL LABOR BOTH SKILLED AND UNSKILLED WHETHER IT IS EMPLOYED IN FASHIONING MATERIALS OR DISTRIBUTING THEM IT DOES NOT IGNORE THE POSSIBILITY OF EXTENDING CREDIT TO THAT POLITICAL EFFORT WHICH KEEPS OPEN OR SHOULD KEEP OPEN NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL HIGHWAYS AND OPPORTUNITIES THIS CONCEPTION OF LABOR IMMEDIATELY CHALLENGES MANY POPULARLY ACCEPTED THEORIES IT ALSO INVITES COMPARISON AS TO VALUE AND REMUNERATION 76A LABOR ATTITUDE TOWARD PRODUCTION THE MANUAL WORKER SHOULD EACH FACTOR IN THE SCHEME OF PRODUCTION BE TREATED EQUALLY IF THERE IS DIFFERENTIATION IN WHOSE FAVOR SHOULD IT OPERATE SHOULD THE IN VENTOR THE CAPITALIST THE ORGANIZER OR THE MANUAL WORKER HAVE PREFERENCE EACH WILL ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS AC CORDING TO HIS UNDERSTANDING AND HIS CIRCUMSTANCES TO ME IT SEEMS JUST THAT THE MANUAL WORKER SHOULD BE FAVORABLY PLACED THAT HIS SHARE OF THE PROFITS OF PRODUCTION SHOULD BE GENEROUS AND ASSURED AND THAT HIS SOCIAL OBLIGATIONS TO HIS FAMILY AND TO HIS FELLOWS SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED WHEN HIS SHARE IS DETERMINED THERE IS ONE ETERNAL AND IMMUTABLE STIPULATION THE MANUAL WORKER MUST PRODUCE VALUE IN RETURN FOR THE VALUE HE RECEIVES WHETHER HIS SHARE IS PAID IN WAGES OR IN GOODS IS IMMATERIAL TO THE QUESTION HE MUST REPLACE THIS SHARE BY PRODUCING WHAT WILL BALANCE HIS PERSONAL ACCOUNT REPLACE WASTE PROVIDE RESERVES AND MAINTAIN THE STATE IF THE MANUAL LABORER COOPER ATING WITH HIS FELLOW LABORERS DOES THESE FOUR THINGS THE FACE VALUE OF THE WAGES HE RECEIVES AND THE HOURS HE WORKS ARE OF LITTLE MOMENT HE CAN HAVE A HUNDRED POUNDS PER DAY FOR A TWOHOUR DAY PROVIDED THE VALUE OF THE HUNDRED POUNDS TO THE COMMU NITY IS PRODUCED EVERYTHING DEPENDS UPON PRODUC TION STANDARDS OF LIVING CANNOT BE RAISED NOR CAN EXISTENCE BE MAIN TAINED UNLESS MANKIND ACCEPTS THIS CONTENTION ELOQUENCE RHETORIC OR LEGISLATIVE ACTION WHETHER ACTING SEP ARATELY OR COLLECTIVELY CANNOT MAKE THE CORN GROW OR BUILD HOUSES OR FEED CHILDREN OR CLOTHE HUMANITY ONLY WORKING AND THINKING CAN PROVIDE THE THINGS ESSENTIAL TO LIFE AND COMFORT THE DEGREES MAY DIFFER BUT THE FACT REMAINS CONSTANT MANUAL WORKERS WILL INDIVIDUALLY ADMIT THIS BUT THERE IS NO MISTAKING THEIR FEAR OF THE EFFECTS OF WHAT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS OVERPRODUCTION TO THIS THEY HAVE BEEN TAUGHT TO AT TRIBUTE UNDEREMPLOYMENT AND POV ERTY PRODUCE TOO MUCH AND CAPITAL HAS NO FURTHER USE FOR US IS THE PHRASE WITH WHICH THEY DEFEND CA CANNY DOES OVERPRODUCTION CAUSE UNEMPLOYMENT IS IT TRUE THAT OVERPRODUCTION CREATES UNEMPLOYMENT HAS THERE EVER BEEN OVERPRODUCTION OF THOSE THINGS MANKIND REALLY NEEDS HAVE WE REALLY PRODUCED TOO MANY HOUSES TOO MANY BOOTS TOO MUCH FOOD ARE WE NOT RATHER CONFUSING PRODUCTION WITH CAPACITY TO PURCHASE SHOE MAKERS HAVE BEEN WALKING ABOUT UN EMPLOYED WHILE THEIR CHILDREN WENT TO SCHOOL BAREFOOTED GARMENT WORKERS FREQUENTED THE LABOR EXCHANGE WHILE THEIR CHILDREN WERE ILLCLOTHED AND OTHER OCCUPATIONS WERE SIMILARLY SUFFER ING IF THE CONSUMERS WHO ARE THE WHOLE PEOPLE HAD BEEN ABLE TO BUY THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO UNEMPLOY MENT HERE LIES THE GREAT DANGER OF TODAY TAXATION IMPERFECT METHODS HUMAN MISUNDERSTANDINGS HAVE INCREASED THE COST OF PRODUCTION AND CORRESPONDINGLY DECREASED THE CAPACITY TO PURCHASE THE EXTENT OF THIS DECREASE IS NOT YET APPARENT RESERVES HAVE BEEN EN CROACHED UPON CURRENCY HAS BEEN INFLATED AND CREDIT HAS BEEN EXPLOITED IN THE VAIN HOPE OF ESCAPING THE FACT THESE DEVICES HAVE CLOTHED THE PROBLEM AS WITH A MIST BUT THEY HAVE LEFT IT UNSOLVED IT CAN ONLY BE SOLVED BY ALL THE MEN WHO WORK FACING ECONOMIC FACTS AND COMBINING TO PRODUCE WHAT ALL MEN NEED CAN THEY DO THIS SAFELY WILL THOSE WHO CONCEIVE ORGANIZE AND CAPITALIZE DO THEIR PARTS WILL THEY ADOPT METH 77THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY ODS OF PRODUCTION WHICH GIVE MAXI MUM RESULTS IN GOODS OR SERVICES WITH MINIMUM STRAINS UPON MEN AND WOM EN WILL THEY ARRANGE THAT THE INDUSTRIES FOR WHICH THEY ARE RESPONSI BLE SHALL BEAR THE COST OF ACCIDENT OF SICKNESS AND OF UNEMPLOYMENT WHICH UNDER ANY SCHEME MUST SOMETIMES BE UNAVOIDABLE AS FOR EXAMPLE WHEN CHANGES OF METHOD ARE INTRODUCED OR CHANGING DEMANDS NECESSITATE CHANGED COMMODITIES THERE IS PLENTY OF IDLE TALK ABOUT THE REMUNERATION OF CAPITAL THIS ARISES PARTLY FROM THE HABIT OF ADVER TISING PROFITS AND INTERRING LOSSES ONE HEARS OFTEN OF THE FORTUNES MADE BUT SELDOM OF THE FORTUNES LOST THERE IS THE ADDED ERROR OF STATING PROFITS IN AGGREGATES INSTEAD OF IN PER CENTAGES OF CAPITAL EMPLOYED CAPITAL DOES HOWEVER SOMETIMES RECEIVE REMUNERATION OUT OF ALL PRO PORTION TO THE SERVICE IT RENDERS SOMETIMES IT IS FORESIGHT WHICH MAKES THESE LARGER PROFITS SOMETIMES IT IS SHEER LUCK IN EITHER CASE THE EFFECT UPON THE IMAGINATION OF THE MASS IS A BAD ONE TO REMOVE MISUNDERSTANDING AND TO SECURE IMMEDIATE PRODUCTIVE RE SULTS SHOULD BE THE AIMS OF EVERY MAN INTERESTED IN HUMAN WELLBEING RI VALRY AND ANTAGONISM BETWEEN MANUAL WORKERS AND OTHER WORKERS AND CAPITAL MUST BE REPLACED BY THAT INTELLIGENT UNDERSTANDING WHICH COMES FROM JOINT AND HONEST HANDLING OF DIFFICULT PROB LEMS THE ALTERNATIVE IS FAMINE AND SUFFER ING SUCH AS THE WORLD HAS NOT YET SEEN NOT ONLY WILL THE AREA AND NUMBERS INVOLVED BE GREATER BUT THE PEOPLE ARE MORE NERVOUSLY DEVELOPED AND CONSEQUENTLY LESS ABLE TO BEAR CALAM ITY IT HAS BEEN AN APPRECIATION OF THIS DANGER WHICH HAS LED ME TO IGNORE THE PERSONAL DANGER AND DURING THE PAST FIVE YEARS TO POINT OUT THE FUTILITY OF NOMINAL WAGES AND WHILE PLEADING FOR A FAIR DAYS PAY TO INSIST UPON A FAIR DAYS WORK 78

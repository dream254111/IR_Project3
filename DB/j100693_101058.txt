you with the following Experiment of ve ry late date The first instant it froze the wind at North the Frost and Wind continued some little Snow now and then fallingthe 2d3d4th5th6thuntil the 7th in the mor ning when the wind came about to the SouthEast and the weather broke up a pace the Sycamores bled not all this while but the seventh about noon all Trees of that kinde bled very freely both at the Twigs and Body and I struck above a dozen At this same Critical season I was willing to repeat the Experiment upon other Trees and to this end I forthwith struck the Hamthorn Hazel WildRose GooseberryBush Apple Tree CherryTree BlatherNut Apricock Cherrylaw rel Vine Walnut yet none bled but the last namd and that but faintly in comparison of the Sycamore This is consonant to our former Experiments And if it did hap pen as I said in one of my former Letters  that these Sycamores bled not all this Winter afore at the wounds made the first of November I do now think that if new wounds had been still made at every breach of Frost some signes at least of our Yorkshire bleeding  might have been discovered be fore now But I affirm no more than I have seen and tried  See No 68 p 2068  See the ground for this di distinction in the same Numb 68p 2067 2068 In all the Monuments of the Ancients collected by the great industry of Pliny I finde but few instances of this nature Amongst those few there is one that is registred with two or three remarkable circumstances to our pur pose He tells us that the Physicians of old when they had a mind2121 a mind to draw the juyce of the Mulberrytree were wont to strike it skindeep only and that about two hours after Sunrise This Experiment is twice mentiond by him and in both places as a strange Phaenomenon We might make our Comment upon those places but for this time are content only to transcribe the Texts Lib 16 cap 38 Mirum hic cortex in Moro Medicis succum quaerentibus fere hara diei secunda lapide incussus manat altius

our Experiments concerning the motion of the Sap in Trees Febr 11th all was here coverd with a white Frost betwixt 9 and 11 in the morning The weather changing I made the Experiments which follow upon the Sycamore Walnut Maple A twig cut asunder would bleed very freely from that part remaining to the Tree and for the part separated it would be altogether dry and shew no signs of moisturealthough we held it some prety time with the cut end downwards But if this sepa rated twig was never so little tippd with a knife at the o ther end it would forthwith shew moisture at both ends The same day late in the afternoon the weather very open and warm a Twig cut off in like manner as in the morning would shew no moisture at all from any part These Experiments we repeated very many times with constant and like success on all the Trees abovementio ned I enterd this Experiment with these Quaeries for the next opportunity 1 Whether a Twig or the small part of a Root cut asunder will not bleed faster upon the breaking up of a Frost from the part remaining to the Tree than from the part separated and whether the part separated will bleed at all and shew no more signes of moi sture than a Twig cut from the top of the Tree unless that small Root be likewise cut off at the other end also 2 Whether when it shall happenthat a Sycamore shall be found to bleed upon the setting in of a great Frost the top X x 2 twig2122 twigs and small roots will not both of them bleed freelier from the parts separated in proportion to their bigness 3 And if it shall not so prove in the Tryal that in cold weather the Sap moves inwards from Root and Branch to the Trunk and that upon the breaking of a Frost the Sap moves outward from the Trunk to the extremities of both Root and Branch I say if this prove not so whe ther there be any different motions of Sap at a time in the divers parts of one and the same Tree and where such motions of Sap begin and whither they tend 4 Whether the Sap when it will run moves longer in the Branches than in the Roots or whether it begin not to move in all parts of a Tree at a time and rest every where at a time 5 When it restswhether it retires to the Body of the Tree from the Roots and Branches or sinks down to the Root or is any way spent by insensible steams or is quiet and lodged in every part of the Tree in proportion I shall long to hear the success of your Experiments in the Question of the Circulation of the Sap I have many years been inclind to think that there is some such motion in the Juyces of Vegetables The reasons which induced me are 1 Because I finde that all the Juyce of a Plant is not extravasate and loose and like Water in a Spunge but that there are apparent Vessels in Plants analagous to Veins in Animals which thing is most conspicuous and clear in such Plants whose Juyce is either White or Red or Saffron colourd for instance in each kind of Juyce we propose Lactuca Atractilis Chelidonium majus 2 Be cause that there are very many Plants and these last na med are of the number whose Juyce seems never to be at rest but will spring at all times freely as the Blood of A nimals upon Incision The way of Ligature by Metalline Rings by you men tiond is an Expedient I have not used but other Liga tures I have upon a great number of our English Plants not without the discovery of many curious Phaenomena The success of an Experiment of this Nature upon Catapu tia minor Lobel was as followes I tied a silkthread upon one2123 one of the Branches of this Plant as hard as might be and not break the skin there followd no greater swel ling that I could discern on the one side of the silk than on the other although in often repeating the Experiment some silks were left hours and dayes unloosed and yet the dimple which the thread had made in the yielding branch es had a little raised the immediate sides but both alike the Plant in like manner would bleed very freely both a bove and under the Tye This was also I thought very remarkable amongst other things in this Experimentthat in drawing the Rasour round about the branch just above or below the Tye the Milky Juyce would suddenly spring out of infinite small holes besides the made orifice for more than half an inch above and below the Tye which seems to argue that though there was no Juyce intercep ted in appearance from any turgescence as in the process upon the members of a Sanguineous Animal yet the Veins were so overthronged and full that a large orifice was not sufficient to discharge the sudden impetus and pressure of a someways streightend Juyce I have endeavourd many wayes to discover the Confi guration of the Veins of Vegetables and their other consti tuent parts and Texture but enough of this in one Letter 4 March 17 167 01 York To the end that I might satisfie my self about some of the doubts I sent you I have been most concernd according to former thoughts and inclinations in examining the Truth of these Quaeries viz Whether Saps are not to be found at all seasons of the Year in a much like Consistence and Quanti ty in the respective parts of a Vegetable and what Communica tion one part of a Plant may have with another in relation to the Ascent and Descent of Sap Now because Sap is then said to Ascend from the Root when it is found to move in Tapping I loppd off certain Branches of a Sycamore the morning betimes of a hard Frost Febr 21 before they would bleed or shew any signe of moisture This I did to vary the Efficient not willing to wait the Change of the Weather and the Suns heat2124 heat but brought them within the Air of the Fire And by and by as I expected they bled apace without being sensibly the warmer The Experiment repeated afforded me divers Phaenome na which follow and proved almost an Universal way of Bleeding all sorts of Trees even those which of themselves would not shew any signes of moisture 1 Poles of Maple Sycamore and Walnut cut down in open weather and brought within the warmth of the Fire did bleed in an instant Also Willow Hazel Cherry Wood bind Blathernut Vine Elder Barbery Apple tree Ivy c Whicking and Egge berry Tree ie Padus Theophrasti tried in the same manner in Craven 2 Briar and Rasberryrods were more obstinate Ash utterly refused even heated hot 3 Branches that is Poles with their tops entire and un cut bleed also when brought to the Fire side but seem not so freely to drink up their Sap again when inverted as when made Poles 4 The same WillowPoles left all night in the grassspot and returnd the next day to the Fireside bleed afresh 5 Maple and WillowPoles bleed and cease at pleasure a gain and again if quickly withdrawn and balanced in the hand and often inverted to hinder the Falling and Expence of Sap Yet being often heated they will at length quite cease though no Sap was at any time sensibly lost And when they have given over bleeding that is shewing any moisture by being brought within the warmth of the Fire the Bark will yet be found very full of Juyce 6 An hard Ligature made within a quarter of an inch of the end of a Wood bind rod did not hinder its bleeding at all when brought within the warmth of the Fire 7 Maple and WillowPoles c quite bared of Bark and brought to the Fire will shew no moisture at all in any part 8 One Barbery or Pipridgepole bared of its Bark brought to the Fire did shew moisture from within the more inward Circles though not any from the outward 9 Maple and Willowpoles c half bard of Bark woud bleed2125 bleed by the Fire from the half onely of those Circles which lay under the bark 10 Maple and Willowpoles split in two and planed would not shew any moisture on the planed sides but at the ends only 11 A Pole of Ivy did of it self exudate and shew a li quid and yellowish rosin from the bark and near the pith but when brought to the Fire side it bled a dilute thin and colourless Sap from the intermediat wood Circles 12 A Pole of Willow for Example bent into a bow will ouse its Sap freely as in bleeding either spontaneously or by the Fire Extract of a Letter Written to the Publisher by Francis Wil loughby Esq from his House at Middleton in Warwick shire March 16 167 relating to some particulars above mentiond in M Lysters Communications of Feb 15167 SIR My business and want of time to prosecute Experi ments I hope will plead my excuse for not answering yours of Feb 18 sooner Since that we have reviewd our old notes and made some few Experiments and finde that Branches of Willow Birch and Sycamore cut off and held perpendicularly will bleed without tipping and that the cuting off of their tops does not sensibly promote the blee ding We have not yet made trial in Maple and Walnut the weather having been such that those Trees have not run freely since the receipt of your Letter We doubt not of Mr Lysters diligence and veracity and wonder our Experi ments should differ The Tri als we have made this year con firm those we communicated to you formerly viz The Sycae more bleeds upon the first considerable Frost after the Leaf is fallen as it did plentifully the 16th of November last And both that Walnut and Maple bleed all Winter long after frosts when the weather relents and the Sun shines out but Walnut and Maple begin not so soon as the Sycamore The Birch will not bleed till towards the Spring This year it began something sooner than ordinary about the begin ning of February  See this difference remo ved below by Mr Lister him self We2126 We cut off pretty big branches of Birch and having tippd the ends inverted them and fastend a Limbus or ring of soft wax to the great ends which we held upwards making with the plane of the end a Vessel of about an inch deep whereinto we powred water which in a few minutes sunk into the pores of the wood and running quite through the length of the branch droppd out of the ends conside rably fast continuing so to do as long as we powrd on wa ter The like Experiment we made by fastening such rings of wax to the lesser ends and powring in water which run through the wood and droppd out of the greater ends as fast or faster This we tried once upon a Sycamore without success Extract of a Letter of the abovementioned Mr Lister writ ten to the Publisher from York April 8 1671 both in re lation to the further Discovery of the Motion of Juyces in Vegetables and removing the difference noted in the next foregoing Letter SIR Yours of the 4th instant came safe to my hands This last Month hath been a busie time with me in my private concerns so that I have but a few things to return to what you have been pleased to communicate to me in relation to the further discovery of the Motion of Juyces in Vegeta bles And I must acquaint you that these Notes follow ing are above 14 dayes old for I have scarce busied my head or put my hand to any Experiment of later date One or both ends of the pith of a Willowpole seald up with hard wax will yet freely bleed by the warmth of the Fire This was tried when the last Experiments I sent you were and were then I think omitted March 24th was the greatest Frost and Snow we have had this Winter in these parts about York Some Twigs and Branches of the very same Willowtree as for merly and likewise of many other Willowtrees taken off this morning March 23th when brought within the Air of the Fire would shew no moisture at all no not when hea ted warm and often and long turnd March 24th the same Willowbranches which yesterday would not bleed and were thrown upon the Grassspot all night2127 night did both they and others new cut down by the Fire side freely shew moisture and bleed this morning upon the breaking up of the Frost Ashpoles and branches this day nor yesterday would by the Fire be no more moist than when I formerly tried them The same morning March 23th a Twig of Maple which had had the top cut off the 7th of February last past and which then bled this day being quite taken off from the Tree and brought within the Air of the Fire and held with the formerly cutend downwards did not run at all at the end but held on in that posture it did run apace at the other newcut end up permost so as to spring and trickle down Note That this doth well agree with my Experiments made the last year at Nottingham where I observd wounds of some months standing to bleed apace at the breaking up of every hard FrostFor firstin these parts there hath been no hard Frost this yearnot comparable to the last year Again those Notting hamtrees I wounded in the Trunk and they stood against a Brickwall and the wounds were on the side next it and be sides had Horsedung stoppd in all of them for some reasons which things did undoubtedly defend them much from the Air and Windsand keep the wounds still green and open Wher as the tops of these Mapletwiggs spoken of in the last Experi ment were exposd in an open hedge to the Air and Winds as also the two Sycamores here at York mentiond in my former Let ter to have been wounded in November last and not to have shewd any signes of moisture for that very cause that they were not fresh struck at Bleeding times Concerning the Bleeding of Poles and entire Branches held perpendicular Mr Willoughby is in the right and some Experi ments in my last to you of March 17th confirm it Yet it is very true what I observd though the Cause I did not then well take notice of when I first made the Experiment and sent you an accompt of it For I held the Twigs which I had cut off a slope joyning and holding up the cuts together in my left hand that I might the better observewhich part or cut would bleed or not bleed the faster and because I found that the cut of the separated Twig did not in that posture holding it up wards as I said for the advantage of my eye bleed at all when as the Cut of the Branch remaining to the Tree did freely bleed Yy I2128 I therefore inverted the separated Twig and held it perpendi cular with the cut end downward and found that that little they were exposd to the Air in an upright posture had so ve ry much checkd the motion of the Sap that I concluded they would not bleed at all and yet striking off their tops and ma king Poles of them I found some of them if not allthat I chancd to try as I remember would shew moisture But I am convin ced sincethat it was rather some unheeded accident as violent ly bending them or perhaps the warmth of my hand and fea son or place which caused this new motion of Sap than meer ly the striking off their Tops

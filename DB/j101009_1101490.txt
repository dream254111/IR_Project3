England and America prosecution for crimes was left to counsel employed by private parties except in cases where the state was directly interested Now however statutes giving to public prosecutors exclusive control of prosecution except for certain minor offenses are universal throughout the United States An interesting question arising out of this change was recently discussed in the Montana courts It was held that a district attorney may during the trial receive assistance from counsel privately employed and compensated State v Tghe 71 Pac Rep 3 One judge dissented on the ground that The private attorneys client is a stranger to the action The private attorney repre sents vengeance The states attorney paid by the people is expected to repre sent justice Some courts agreeing with this dissenting opinion maintain that to allow privately employed assistants to appear for the State is inconsistent with our theory of criminal prosecution besides being impliedly prohibited by statutes forbidding the taking of private fees by district attorneys Biemel v State 71 Wis 444 The weight of authority however even where suchi statutes exist is clearly in accord with the principal case State v Bartlett 55 Me 200 Keyes v State 122 Ind 527 Under the old law compensation necessarily came from private sources in many cases The private employment of assistant prosecutors was thus proper formerly and there has been no express prohibition of the practice since The only ques tion then is whether the change in our system of prosecution for crime has impliedly excluded all private interference and aid Criminal prosecution is now strictly an affair of the state It is and always must be under the control of counsel employed by the government and they as public officers cannot delegate their power The ideal it may be said toward which our law is tending is the elimination of the idea of individual vengeance The prosecuting attorney should seek the conviction and punishment of the prisoner not for the satisfaction of the injured persons but for the protection of society and the effect on the criminal himself As a representative of the state he seeks the promotion of justice and occupies a position similar to that of the judge In the management and with drawal of prosecutions he has important discretion That he mav be free to act in accordance with justice and the public interests he must remain independent and free from all obligation to the parties interested in securing convictions The private employment of an assistant it is urged will inevitably introduce into the prosecution an undesirable element of partizanship In such an argument there is undoubtedly much force If however the official public prosecutor himself is forbidden to receive compensation from private par ties and is left in full control the policy underlying the statutes would seem to be well satisfied The interest of the state will then be the paramount influence All that the private attorney can do is to help forward that interest and so inci dentally to satisfy his client It is desirable that the states attorney should be allowed to receive all necessary aid that he may successfully prosecute the guilty Justice is best promoted niot by a judicial impartiality on his part but by a vigorous and carefully prepared presentation of his side of the case It is doubtful1903 MISCELLANY 255 also whether the theorv that the state is the sole party in interest is sound The injured parties as individuals have surrendered their natural right of punishment to the state but it would seem that they retain an interest in the states enforce ment of that right In some measure then the prosecutor represents them aind is under an obligation to accept their aid that their wrongs may be requited and their future protection secured Such participation cannot be demnanded as an absolute right but it seems desirable that the court should have discretion to allow it at the request of the district attorneyHarvard Law Review NEGLIGENCEAUTOMOB1LECARE REQUIRED OF AN OPERATORThies v Tlhomas 77 N Y Supp 276 Supreme Court 1902 A little boy six years old while playing in the street was run over by the defendants automobile Suit is here brought in negligence for the accident The court defined the law of negli gence applicable to the case negatively by describing the duty of care legallv equired of an operator Its language is as follows  An operator of an auto mobile is bound to anticipate that he may meet persons at any point in the public streets and must keep a proper lookout for them and have his machine under such control as will enable him to avoid a collision with another also using proper care and caution and if necessary must slow up and even stop This is his ordinary duty of care The court goes on to say  Where the operator meets children of tender years he is required to exercise more than ordinary care to avoid a col lision But the fact that the accident occurred between blocks and not at a street crossing was admitted as evidence for the jury on the question of the negli gence of the operator This is the first and as far as our research has revealed the only decision of a higher court in which the law of negligence has been applied to the case of an automobile As the world has progressed different modes of conveyance have been usedhorses wagons and carriages stage coaches tramlines railroads horse cars elevated railroads electric cars bicycles and now steam and electric automobiles As each of these came into use the law of negligence was enlarged and modified to apply to them Especially in the case of the railroad and to a lesser degree in tne case of the trolley car has the law been applied to changed conditions The rapidly increasing number of automobiles demands of the courts a further interpretation of the law of negligence as applied to these new condi tions This is a question of real interest today Therefore a decision of au thority upon this subject must be considered worthy of attention and careful examination In the English case of Boss v Litton 5 Car  Payne 407 1832 Chief Justice Denman defines the rights of travellers on the highways He says All per sons paralytic as well as others have a right to walk in the road and are entitled to the exercise of reasonable care on the part of persons driving carriages alonig it Viewed from the standpoint of later cases this is an extreme statement of the rights of a pedestrian on a public way As the traffic upon city streets has become greater and the speed of travel has increased bv reason of the introdtuction of electric railways public policy has required the courts to limit the rights of pedestrians This has been accomplished not so much by change in principle as by change in the interpretation of the old terms  reasonable and ordinary No courts go so far as to say pedestrians have no rights on the highway but they256 9 VIRGINqIA LAW REGISTER July do demand a high degree of care of any person using the street Drivers of ve hicles are excused where this high degree of care is not exercised by footpassen gers upon the ground of contributory negligence Some states make a difference between the rights of ordinary teams and of cars on a street railway A pedestrian and a private team have nearly equal rights upon the highway The case of Rahn v Singer Company 26 Fed Rep 912 1885 states the general law The court said  Travellers on foot and teams have equal rights on public highways but both are required to exercise the care and diligence that the circumstances demand at the time So too in the case of Stringer v Frost 116 Indiana 477 1888 it was said  The plaintiff has a right to cross the street at a crossing or elsewhere exercising such caution and prudence as the circumstances demanded to avoid being injured while the defendant had the right to ride along the street on horseback observing such watchfuilness for footmen and having his animal under such control as would enable him to avoid injury to others who had corresponding and reciprocal rights in the street The law thus holds the driyer of a horse to as strict a duty of care as it does the pedes trian each must be equally on the lookout for the other to prevent collision On the other hand street cars are in some states given a superior right of way In Pennsylvania this doctrine of superior rights has been firmly implanted in the law It is expressed in the case of Elhrisman v RBilway Company 150 Pa 180 1892  Street railways have not this exclusive right of steam railroads Their tracks are used in common by their cars and the travelling public While this common use is conceded and is unavoidable in towns and cities the railway com panies and the public have not equal rights Those of the railway companies are superior Their cars have the right of way and it is the duty of the citizen whether on foot or in vehicles to give unobstructed passage to the cars This results from two reasonsfirst the fact that the car cannot turn out or leave its track and secondly for the convenience and accommodation of the public These companies have been chartered for the reason in part at least that they are a public accommodation The convenience of an individual who seeks to cross one of their tracks must give way to the convenience of the public This case has been affirmed as late as 1898 in the case of Smith v Traction Company 187 Pa 110 Other states refuse to recognize such a doctrine and hold strictly to the old doctrine that the highway is for all equally with a reciprocal duty of care In these states a reasonable degree of care on the part of both rider anld pedestrian is required but there is no attempt made to apply the strict  stop look and listen rule to the pedestrian as is done in Pennsylvania The case of Laufer v Traction Company 68 Conn 475 1897 takes this view of the law It declares that  elec tric cars have no superior rights on the highway The right to use the highway is common to all travellers and is to be to exercised by each that the just rights of the others are not unreasonably interfered with Though apparently giving a higher right to pedestrians than does th Pennsylvania doctrine the results are practically the same in most cases It does not seem necessary to discuss the correctness of either of the conflicting opinions with regard to street railways The reasons for allowing street cars a superior right of way and peculiar privileges do not apply to the case of automo biles The latter are private conveyances and in no sense different from horses1903 MISCELLANY 257 and carriages in their use of the highway They are not a public means of rapid transit and do not serve the great body of citizens They are merely for the con venience of individuals Again they are not confined to any definite track but may turn to right or left at will Indeed they are more quickly and more easily guided than horses and carriages This freedom of motion is one of the reasons that makes them particu larly dangerous to the pedestrian Instead of as formerly a single line of track to watch he rnust now watch the whole street Instead of certain streets upon which are laid car tracks all streets alike will demand of him a high degree of care The increased speed and comparative noiselessness add to his peril Coxthmon sense would seem to require of the operators of automobiles a very high degree of care upon city streets higher than that of drivers of other vehicles Rapid transit for the benefit of the public may be excused but a racing speed for the pleasure of individuals should not be tolerated The foot traveller has been subjected to sufficient danger already by the street railways Unless some restric tion is placed upon the use of the highway by this new kind of conveyance he will be practically excluded from the streets The great number of negligence cases in our courts bear witness to the injurious effects of a high speed in thickly populated districts And these accidents occur in spite of the fact that persons are put on their guard by the presence of tracks With automobiles speeding up and down every street the dangers of the highway will be infinitely increased It is for these reasons we believe the Supreme Court correct in its decisions in ap plying strictly the duty of care required of drivers of horses to the new conditions A careful consideration of the question can lead but to this conclusion A progress which would endanger the lives of so many of our citizens is not progress and surely cannot excuse any innovation in the law Qf negligenceAmerican Law Register CORPORATIONS AS GUARANTORSI While there is considerable conflict among the authorities as to the application of the doctrine yet it seems to be firmly established as a principle of law that a corporation has no power to guarantee the contract of any other person or corporation unless 1 the power to give such guaranty is expressly granted by its charter or 2 the giving of such guaranty is an essential part of some transaction which is clearly within the authorized powers of the corporation An illustration of the first kind of cases is the case of Green Bay  M R R Co v Union Steamboat Co 107 U S 98 where it was held that a railroad corporation whose charter authorized it to make suich con tracts with any other person or corporation as the management of its railroad and the convenience and interest of the corporation might in the judgment of the directors require had power under its charter to niake an agreement with a steamboat line which connected with its road by which it guaranteed that the gross earnings of each boat of said line would amount to a certain sum for two years while an illustration of the second kind of cases may be found in the case of Broadway National Bank v Baker 176 Mass 294 in which it was held that a loan and trust company selling a bond given by another corporation had implied power to guarantee to the pujrchaser the payment of such bond at maturity II One of the most common forms of guaranteeing the contract of another consists in the execution of accommodation paper This method of helping ones258 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER July neighbor is however forbidden to corporations since it is clearly settled under the authorities that the making and endorsing of accommodation paper are not within the scope of ordinary corporate business Pick Bloch  Joel v Ettinger 66 Ill App 570 Patk Hotel Co v Fourth Nat Bank 86 Fed Rep 742 National Park Bank v GermanAmerican M1 W  S Co 116 N Y 281 Steiner v Steiner L  L Co 120 Ala 128 26 So Rep 494 Blake v Domestic Mfg Co N J 38 Atl Rep 241  It is a well established rule that a corporation cannot ordinarily be bound by its signature to or indorsement or guaranty of the note or paper of another person for the accommodation of the latter The directors are authorized by the stock holders to do business for corporate purposes but are not authorized to use the corporation to perform acts of friendship or accommodation to others The general rule is that the accommodation indorsement signature or guaranty of the corporation is illegal and cannot be enforced Cook on Corporations 4th Ed sec 774 citing many cases In the case of Murphy v Arkansas  L L  I Co 97 Fed Rep 723 it was held that a private corporation which owes no debts may execute accommoda tion paper provided all the stockholders and directors assent thereto but this was denied in the case of Steiner v Steiner L  L Co 120 Ala 128 26 So Rep 494 where it was held that accommodation paper could not be executed by a corporation even by the unanimous consent of all its stockholders In Lyon Potter  Co v First National Bank 85 Fed Rep 120 122 the court said  It is ultra vires of a commercial corporation and its officers to make ac commodation paper or to guarantee the payment of obligations of others  An endorsement of this character however is not malum in se is not prohibited by statute and is not beyond the general scope of the powers of such a corpora tion It is merely an excessive exercise of one of those powers an excessive exercise of the power which it has in proper cases to make and endorse com mercial paper Where such an endorsement has been apparently made for the benefit of the corporation and has been in fact made partly for its own benefit and partly for the accommodation of another and the corporation has received and retained the benefits of the endorsement the contract is not void because it is no defense for a private corporation against the enforcement of an executed contract whose benefits it holds that while its execution was within the general scope of its powers it involved an excessive exercise of one of them While such a corporation retains the benefits of such a contract it silently affirms and must not be permitted to deny its validity The opinion cites numerous au thorities upon both branches of this proposition In Rogers v Jewell Belting Co 184 Ill 574 reversing 84 Ill App 249 it was held that a business corporation had no power to become suirety on the note of another corporation It was also held in this case that since the corporation could not execute a note as suirety because that was not a legitimate corporate purpose the fact that an extensiotn was given to the principal which under ordinary circumstances would be sufficient consideration to support the promise of a surety would make no difference And on the same principle it has been held in Iowa that a corporation whose business was the transfer of freight had no power to become surety for another company Lucas v White Line Transfer Co 70 Ia 541 30 N W Rep 7711903  MISCELLANY 259 III Many of the cases of corporate guaranties arise out of the efforts of cor porations to promote the interests of their customers and thereby increase their own business An illustration of this is the case of a brewing company guaran teeing the lease of a saloon keeper who is a customer of the company It has been repeatedly held that such a giaranty is within the power of the brewing company Standard Brewery v Kelly 66 Ill App 267 272 Fuld v Burr Brewing Co 18 N Y Supp 456 Holm v Lipsius Brewing Co 47 N Y Supp 518 Koehler v Reinheimer 49 N Y Supp 755 reversing 45 N Y Supp 327 Aaronson v Mayer Brewing Co 56 N Y Supp 387 Winterfield v Cream City Brewing Co 96 Wis 239 71 N W Rep 101 Contra Filon v Mliller Brewing Co 15 N Y Supp 57 But in the case of Best Brewing Co v Klassen 185 111 37 reversing 85 Ill App 464 it was held that a corporation organized to manufacture and sell beer had no implied or express power to become surety on an appeal bond in a forci ble detainer suit between third parties where it was not shown that such an act was reasonably necessary to accomplish the end for which the corporation was formed It was also held in this case that if the person for whom the appeal bond was given was a customer of the brewing company and the bond was given for the purpose of enabling him to continue his business and make further pur chases of beer from the company the benefits to accrue to the corporation there from would be so precarious and remote as not to constitute a valuable considera tion In Kelley Mau  Co v OBrien Varnish Co 91 Ill App 287 the same doctrine was announced upon a similar state of facts And in the case of Humboldt Mlining Co v American M Hf  M Co 62 Fed Rep 356 361 it was held that a corporation organized for the purpose of mak ing iron work for mining plants had no power to guarantee the performance of anothers contract for the erection of a mining plant although the guarantee would secure to the corporation the sale of the iron work to be used in the plant and it was also held that the performance of such contract on the part of the party guaranteed did not estop the corporation from denying its power to give the guaranty It was said in this case that the general rule in this country and England impliedly prohibited any corporation from guaranteeing the contract or debt of another and many cases were cited by the court in support of that pro positionNational Corporation Reporter QUESTIONS PROPOUNDED BY THE COURT OF APPEALS ON THE BAR ExAMINA TION AT

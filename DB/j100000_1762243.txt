Kretzschmar of Brooklyn read a paper at the recent meeting in Albany of the New York Medical Society on the use of alcohol in certain forms of fever He be lieved that in some diseases alcohol if properly administered was not only instrumental in prolonging life but was frequently a most potent factor in preserving it Alcohol possesses the qualities of both food and medicine It is one of the best antiseptics and the most reliable remedy we have in the treatment of diphtheria He regarded alcohol as beneficial in the treatment of phthisis espe cially when the temperature of the patient was increased In the discussion which followed Dr Castle advised that stimulants be kept in several small bottles as when exposed to the air they lost valuable medicinal properties BOVINE TUBERCULOSIS  Dr Brush of Mount Vernon discussed at the Albany meeting the subject of bovine tuberculosis Of all do mesticated animals the bovines are the most subject to tuberculosis Five per cent of the cattle in England are affected with tuberculosis and it is said that twenty per cent of the cattle in some of the thoroughbred Jersey herds in the Northern States are similarly affected He believed that more human beings were not infected because the normal temperature of the human race was so much lower than that of the bovine 985QF in the one and 101o to 103 F in the other this latter temperature being necessary for the growth of the germ of the disease The cultivation of tuberculosis in animals confirms this view as resistance to the dis ease decreased as the normal temperature of the animal increased Thus in the dog resistance was good while in the common fowl it was niz Dr Brush thought that the Federal Government would do better to spend its money in the investigation and suppression of this disease than to appropriate five hundred thousand dollars to stamp out pleuropneumonia which did not affect the human race He believed that if bovine tuberculosis were eradicated it would soon become eliminated from the human race and he thought that physicians should strive to procure laws which would accom plish this ELECTRICAL SCIENCE Secondary Batteries IT has been for many years the dream of inventors to perfect some apparatus by which energy could be stored to be used when occasion required The secondary battery accomplishes this better than any thing else that has been invented but it has limitations and defects that it is well to point out The two principal uses with a great number of minor applica tions to which secondary batteries can be put at present are the distribution of energy for electric lighting and their use in driving streetcars As for the first of these it is well known that the direct system of constant potential distribution cannot be employed at any considerable distance from the central station owing to the heavy investment in copper necessary If storagebatteries could be eco nomically used however they could be distributed at different points through the district to be lighted and charged by a high potential current allowing comparatively small conductors to be used and employing the electric plant during the day when it would otherwise be idle The advantages for streetcar work are apparent each car carries vithin itself the energy necessary for running it a breakdown of one car does not affect the rest of the system Compared with other electrical systems the advantages are that it can be used in crowded streets with no danger from high potential currents and VOL XI No 265 where a large number of cars are used it is much simpler than any other plan Compared with cables it gives a greater economy of power a less first cost and the impossibility of one accident dis abling the whole line The disadvantages of secondary batteries are the cost the waste of energy the deterioration and the weight for a given capacity and rate of discharge The type of storagecell most generally in use is some modifica tion of the Faure cell generally of the FaureSellonVolkmar type In it the plates are made of cast lead supports or  grids into which is pasted a mixture of red lead and sulphuric acid The grid has in it square hourglass shaped holes the contraction in the middle being intended to prevent the active material from falling out The plates pasted with red lead are put into dilute sulphuric acid alter nate plates are connected together and an electric current is sent between the two sets changing them into pure lead and lead per oxide Plates thus formed are put into cells with dilute sulphuric acid a number of lead or negative plates and peroxide or positive plates in each cell This is very briefly the general method of manufacture Now suppose we have one of these cells fully charged  all of the positive plate peroxide all of the negative plate lead  and dis charge it through a resistance At first the electromotive force is over 2 volts This will rapidly run down to about 195 to 2 volts where it will remain constant provided we do not discharge the cell too fast for a considerable time when it will begin to fall and if we continue the discharge it will finally become zero If now the plates be analyzed it will be found that the positive plate has in it peroxide and sulphate of lead the latter perhaps fifteen to twenty per cent of the whole active material The negative plate will consist of pure lead and sulphate If we charge the cell the plates will be changed to pure lead and peroxide again the electro motive force will gradually rise to 225 volts and when the charge is nearly complete oxygen will be given off from the positive plate There are two very important things to be noticed If we charge and discharge the cell a number of times we will find that the en ergy we get out of the cell is less than the energy we put in by an amount that varies with the rate of discharge the efficiency being less as the discharge rate is greater the average efficiency for the present storagecell is something near seventy per cent Another point even more important than the first is that if we greatly in crease the discharge rate the electromotive force of the cell will fall rapidly  and if we persist in this the plates will corrode and buckle and the plugs of active material will fall out of the holes in the plates There is one more disadvantage besides these and that is the fact that the life of the cell especially that of the positive plates is limited Under favorable conditions the positive plates will last on the average two years the negative plates will last inuch longer For lighting the most important disadvantages are the cost the loss of energy and the deterioration The fact that the cells can not be discharged at more than a certain rate does not greatly affect their usefulness in ordinary cases And storagebatteries have reached such a state of development that it is safe to say that if they were sold and repaired at reasonable prices they would have at once a great field of usefulness for electric lighting even with their present defects The principal cost of a storagecell is for material the cost of the labor is comparatively small and when the plates have given out at least a part of the material is left But for tractionwork the greatest disadvantage is in the slow discharge rate permissible At present from three thousand to four thousand pounds of storagebatteries are required to drive an ordinary car the storage capacity being enough for a run of from forty to sixty miles This great weight increases the power neces sary to run the car the wear of the track and the deterioration of the car Besides it means a considerable first investment and a large battery to be kept in repair If we could discharge the bat tery at any rate we wished we could make a round trip with seven hundred and fifty to one thousand pounds of battery We would have to charge our batteries oftener of course but we would greatly decrease our items of first cost depreciation wear of roadbed and cars and even of power expended It has been variously estimated that the difference of expense beMARCH 2 1888 SCIE tween horses and the storagebattery including every thing but the deterioratjon of the battery is from one to three dollars per car per day in favor of the battery Taking a wellknown form of battery as a type supposing fifty per cent over the cost of manufacture is charged for the cells and estimating the cost of horsepower for one of the New York streetrailways the difference of cost of the two systems is roughly two dollars and a half per car per clay Now whether the repairs of the battery will cost this much is a matter that only experience can settle but on roads where the grades are slight it is very probable that the batteries will be most economical The matter at present stands thus only about fourteen per cent of the possible storage capacity of storagecells is utilized their discharge rate is limited so that even this comparatively small capacity is great in comparison to it the cells deteriorate so that a large item of expense is in repairs the efficiency of the cells is not greater than seventy per cent Even with these disadvantages storagebatteries can be largely applied for lighting and traction work It seems impossible with the number of investigators work ing on the subject and the great possibility of improvement that the next few years will not see a great increase in the economy storage capacity and discharge rate of storagecells and a very moderate increase in any of these especially the latter will throw the balance decidedly in their favor for tractionwork For lighting their field is equally extended PRIMARY AND SECONDARY CURRENTS IN INDUCTIONCOILS The relations between the primary and the induced secondary currents in inductioncoils have been investigated mathematically by several writers the clearest and most satisfactory treatment be ing probably that of Mascart and Joubert Since the experiments of Ewing on the magnetization of iron it has been clear not only that the assumptions hitherto made have not accurately represented the facts but that any rigorous mathematical treatment would with our present knowledge be impossible The work of Prof Galileo Ferraris in this connection is important as showing the ex tent of the modification that can take place He has determined experimentally the difference of phase between the primary and secondary currents in an oldtype Gaulard anl Gibbs transformer and comparing them with theoretical deductions of his own finds the agreement satisfactory The objections to his work seem to be that the apparatus he experimented on is obsolete and is not of the type at present universally used the old transformers having an open magnetic circuit while now the magnetic circuit is always closed The work is important however as showing the inade quacy of the at present accepted treatment ETHNOLOGY Notes on the Kwakiool of Vancouver Island DR GEORGE M DAWSON gives in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada for I887 a very interesting sketch of the Kwakiool a people inhabiting the central part of the coast of Brit ish Columbia He describes the numerous tribes of this nation and their several villages but the most interesting part of the paper is a description of their mode of life traditions and language They live in large wooden houses the front of which is painted with de signs representing the fabulous thunderbird whales snakes or salmon while the posts and beams supporting the roof are carved in similar forms The children are for a long time kept tied into the cradle When they leave it the cradle and the bedding must be deposited at a place reserved for this purpose Then a great festival is celebrated and the child is given a name On this occasion the father has to give away a great part of his property Dawson gives very valuable information on this givingaway of property which was well known to be practised by the tribes of the northwest coast but the meaning of which was not clearly under stood He says   The rules governing the Potllatch as this festival is called in the Chinook jargon and its attendant ceremonies have grown to be so complicated that even those persons most familiar with the natives can scarcely follow it in all its details and it is sometimes difficult for the natives themselves to decide certain points The custom was formerly almost entirely confined to the recognized chiefs but of late years it has extended to the people generally and become very ITCE 105 much commoner than before It is regarded as a means of acquir ing and maintaining prestige and power but it has nowadays spread to all classes of the community and become the recognized mode of attaining social rank and respect As a particular instance of the custom let us suppose that a man of one tribe has collected together as his own or obtained control of say five hundred blankets and wishes to make a fiol latch to some other tribe He goes to its village and makes known his intention of distributing a thousand blankets at a certain date He begins by lending out his stock of five hundred blankets giving largernumbers to those who are well off This loan is reckoned a debt of honor to be paid with interest at the proper time It is usual to return two blankets for every one borrowed Thus the stranger obtains the thousand blankets for his fotlatch which with the ac companiment Of much bombastic speechmaking and excitement are distributed in exact proportion to the social position of those taking part Those who receive presents at such a festival become debtors of the man who gives the feast These feasts are celebrated at a mar riage ceremony or when a man wishes to take a new name In connection with the remarks on the potllach Dawson refers to the actual condition of this people and emphasizes the fact that the best way to civilize them will be the establishment of industries among them The report on the legends of the people is of great interest and so is the vocabulary of about seven hundred words which is of great importance as our knowledge of that language is very scanty BOOKREVIEWS Great Waterfalls Calaracls and Geysers By JOHN GIBSON New York T Nelson  Sons I6 125 ChizAs from the Earths Crzsts By JOHN GIBSON New York T Nelson  Sons 16 125 THESE two publications present in a readable form certain phe nomena of physical geography the former treating of famous cata racts and geysers the latter with a variety of geological phenome na such as obtrude themselves upon the attention of the reading public The book on waterfalls and geysers is well illustrated and the author has described almost exclusively those cataracts of which he was able to give an illustration The papers of which the  Chips from the Earths Crustconsist were originally contributions to the Scotsman newspaper Eruptions of volcanoes great landslides tornadoes discoveries of new goldfields the fall of a meteor earth quakes and similar phenomena have given occasion to writing these papers and we think the author has well accomplished his task to write in an agreeable form to suclh people as have no time and occasion for systematic study but want to know what has been discovered regarding the history of the earth and the cause and true character of current geological events The book contains a considerable number of illustrations Mineral Resources of the Unzzted Slates By DAVID T DAY Washington Government 8

issued We find in this volume which is the fourth of the series a minute and exhaustive report on the production and economic value of minerals in the United States The arrangement is according to materials and under each heading the total production re cently opened mines technical improvements imports and exports are treated The statistical tables of the preceding volumes have been brought forward to the close of I886 Besides the report on the annual production the volume contains a brief and interesting review on the American iron industry from its beginning in I6I9 to I886 by James M Swank and an elaborate paper on the iron ores east of the Mississippi River by John Birkinbine to which are added analyses of foreign iron ores smelted in this country The volume is very exhaustive not only treating of metals coal petro leum etc but giving also a review of the production of structural materials fertilizers precious stones the last by George F Kunz in short of all minerals of any economic value

persistent attacks upon the administration of justice by the courts The courts of the nineteenth century were unyielding in their faith that justice must be administered in accordance with fixed rules which could be applied by a rather me chanical process of logical reasoning to a given state of facts and made to produce an inevitable result1 One phase of the reaction against this I See Pound Mechanical Jurisprudence 8 COL L REV 605NOTES 973 kind of legal administration appears in the creation of administrative boards and tribunals for handling special problems such as deter mining  reasonable  rates and reasonable  service by a public service company fixing the amount of compensation under Workmens Com pensation acts etc  for which it was conceived the ordinary judicial machinery was too cumbersome or too dilatory2 Another phase of the movement appears in the creation of juvenile courts domestic relations courts and even municipal courts which while preserving the name and many of the characteristics of courts yet adopt the methods of executive rather than judicial justice3 In other words as compared with ordinary courts all these tribunals proceed more by the application of a trained intuition to the facts of a particular case and less by articulate reasoning from stated premises in the form of legal rules or principles4 It is perhaps too early to make a confident evaluation of the effects of these tendencies upon American legal administration Yet one may feel sure that the ultimately satisfactory solution lies in overhauling and read justing our legal machinery to meet the present social demands in a careful study of these new demands and of the means by which to satisfy them rather than in haphazard blows at the legal institutions which the experience of the past has given us In this connection it is interesting to note the attempts at legal reform made by Mr Justice James E Robinson of the Supreme Court of North Dakota His actions in giv ing to the press a weekly letter as to the doings of the court the number of times each judge is absent from the court and his manner of writing decisions have been commented upon elsewhere5 and Mr Justice Robin son has made a reply to these criticisms which indicates that he is acting in good faith6 Mr Justice Robinsons bete noire is the doctrine of stare decisis He rarely cites authorities in his more recent opinions7 and he expresses a preference for deciding every case in accordance with law reason and justice Thus in BoveyShute Lumber Co v Farmers and Merchants Bank of Leeds8 he dismissed in a few sentences and without citation of authority the contention of a banking corporation that a contract of guaranty made by its cashier was ultra vires and void Mr Justice Robinson says When it the bank takes a loan on land and on crops it must have a right to improve the land and to care for the crops In this case the bank had a perfect right to bargain as they did for the construction of a house and granary It was good business and it should 2 See Winslow A Legislative Indictment of the Courts 29 HARV L REV 395 Pound Executive Justice 55 Am L REG N S 137 3 See Pound

the bank but how about the depositors who were not paid for any such risktaking and whose interests would be jeopardized if the bank engaged extensively in the business of building houses and granaries for its borrowers The learned justices opinion shows clearly one of the chief dangers of administrative justice of justice by discretion rather than of justice by rule namely the tendency to take snap judgment upon the basis of more obvious and pressing in terests to the neglect of those which are more subtle and farreaching Granting for the moment that the decision is supportable the reason ing  of the court 9 should not have ignored the judicial experience of the past in solving the problem of ultra vires acts of banking corporations10 Brevity in the statement of facts by the court so that any child may read and understand it 1 is another point on which Mr Justice Robin son insists Thus in Froelich v Northern Pacific Railway Co12 an action for personal injuries by a railroad employee Mr Justice Robinson writ ing for the court stated the facts so briefly and simply that one had diffi culty upon reading his statement in seeing why the plaintiffs attorneys were so foolish as to bring an action at all and still greater difficulty in seeing why a jury gave a verdict and a judge gave a judgment for the plaintiff in the trial court But upon a rehearing the court in a Per Curiam opinion gives a statement of the facts twice as long as that of Mr Justice Robinson Thus Mr Justice Robinsons method of stating facts did not save the people or the lawyers of North Dakota anything in the way of printing or printpaper after all But something far more important than saving printpaper is in volved in the courts statement of facts A full clear and impartial statement of facts by the court is necessary in order that the legal pro fession and the public may determine whether the judge has decided the case in accordance with the law or in accordance with his individual caprice It is not only an important safeguard against the exercise of an arbitrary discretion by a court of last resort3 but also an essential part of the decision as a precedent for future guidance Another of Mr Justice Robinsons vagaries is his insistence upon a wide use of judicial notice Thus in Ingmundson v Midland Continental Railroad Co14 the court reversed a judgment for defendant in an action for damages caused by an alleged nuisance due to the running of defend 9 The decision was unanimous but two of the justices concurred in the result only 10 See for example Bowen v Needles etc Bank 94 Fed 925 i899 Citizens National Bank v Appleton 2i6 U S i96 i9io See also CooK CORPORATIONS 7 ed  68i 11 See Mr Justice Robinsons Reply 88 CENTRAL L J I55 i56 12 I73 N W N D 822 I9I9 13 Thus in the case just cited granting that the decision was proper no one could tell from reading Mr Justice Robinsons opinion that the jury had upon special in terrogatories found the defendant negligent and the plaintiff not negligent that there was some evidence upon which to base these findings and that the real issue in the case was whether or not this evidence was sufficient to go to the jury See the dissenting opinion of Mr Justice Bronson In this connection see also Wingen v Minneapolis St Paul  SSM Ry Co I3 N W N D 832 IgIg It is not meant to be denied that courts have in many instances written statements of facts which are unduly prolix and cited authorities needlessly There is no need for going to either extreme 14 I73 N W N D 752 I9I9NOTES 975 ants trains over a right of way adjoining plaintiffs premises Mr Justice Robinson dissenting says The complaint not only fails to state a cause of action but also it shows that plaintiff has no cause of action    In reading such a complaint the court must take judicial notice of such facts as are commonly known to intelligent persons within the jurisdiction of the court We must take judicial notice of the fact that defendant does operate a little railroad running south from James town with small engines and light trains and not with any such mogul engines and trains as pass over the main line of the Northern Pacific Railway    In sofar as the complaint asserts mere exaggerations which are known to be untrue it should be disregarded 15 In England v Town ley6 a suit for libel Mr Justice Robinson dissenting maintained that the complaint did not state a cause of action saying The people are paying less and less regard to such newspaper stuff so that no one suffers from it and the courts are no longer disposed to regard mere exaggera tions which are manifestly untrue7 Judicial justice implies a right to be heard which in turn implies a right to be confronted with the facts upon which the tribunal relies in denying ones claim and to be given an opportunity to rebut them While an exception is made in the case of facts which are notorious8 this does not extend to a judges personal observation of the particular facts of a case9 If the tribunal relies upon its own private knowledge it in effect prejudges the plaintiffs case and denies him due process of law20 Here again the dangers of discretion untrammeled by rule are obvious In fairness however it must be said that Mr Justice Robinsons methods sometimes find their appropriate field Thus in questions of fact in divorce cases2 and in questions of procedure22 the exercise of judicial discretion within broad limits such as due process appears at its best In the case just cited the court said The rule of stare decisis is especially applicable to decisions on matters of procedure and prac tice Mr Justice Robinson said I do strenuously dissent to the building of error upon error I concur in the result but not in the reason ing of the court or the stare decisis It is submitted with deference that if there is any field in which the doctrine of stare decisis is least important it is in the field of procedure No man can acquire a vested right in his opponents procedural error On the whole one who is in warm sympathy with legal reform may 15 Italics ours Note the way in which Mr Justice Robinson after laying down the rule as to facts of common knowledge applies it to facts derived from his personal observations 16 I74 N W N D 755 758 i919 17 The appeal was from an order overruling a demurrer to the complaint

be accomplished by hap hazard attempts to break away from justice according to rule Before rejecting utterly the experience of the past legal reformers should make a careful study of the ends to be attained and of the fields in which rule or discretion as the case may be will conserve the most and sacrifice the least of the interests which the law has to secure Only thus can the courts follow  the path of the law23 23 See Oliver Wendell Holmes The Path of the Law io HARV L REV 457

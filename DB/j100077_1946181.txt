of their residence Such a statute supersedes an ordinance subjecting nonresidents to the requirement Operation of constitutional provisions State v Brodigan Nevada Feb 28 1914 138 Pac 914 The article of the constitution of Nevada providing for referendum and initiative declares that it shall be self executing It fails however to impose upon the Secretary of State any duties regarding the filing of referendum petitions for submission of a law to the voters of a county Held that provision for such filing should be made by statute and that in the absence of a statutory provision the Secretary of State will not be required by mandamus to file the same Legislative Power Delegation statewide referendum Hudspeth v Swayze New Jersey Jan 23 1914 89 Atl 780 The provision of the socalled chancellorsheriff jury act by which its operation is made to depend upon a favorable vote of the people does not con stitute a delegation of legislative power to be exercised directly by the people It is a perfect piece of legislation the effect of which is conditioned upon the happening of the contingency Since the popular vote was affirmative it is not necessary to con sider whether the power to reject would have constituted an uncon stitutional delegation of the power to repealNEWS AND NOTES 485 While the trend of authority is against the validity of such delega tion the affirmative view is supported by such eminent authority that the legislature had the right to form its own judgment Legislative Power Delegation local option Ex parte Francis Texas Jan and Feb 1914 165 S W 147 A local option provision in a statute making its operation in any county dependent upon the result of an election therein does not violate the provisions of the constitution restricting the power to suspend

zona Feb 18 1914 1138 Pac 781 Under the constitution the cor poration commission has full power to fix classifications rates and charger of public service corporations and the legislature has therefore no powes to require such corporations to selltheir products by meter measurement Judicial Power State v Summers South Dakota Dec 30 1913 144 NW 730 An act providing for referendum on municipal ordi nances upheld In our judgment the time has come when courts should decline the task of attempting by construction to add to defective legislation or to eliminate or limit provisions which work public or private injury They should interpret the law as it is written and not otherwise Due Processright of appeal Cullins v Williams Kentucky Nov 21 1913 160 SW 733 An act permitting the commitment of de pendent children fails to provide for a right of appeal This does not invalidate the statute since the right of appeal is purely a matter of legislative discretion However in proper cases parties aggrieved may resort to the writ of habeas corpus or of prohibition486 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW Due Processsummary proceedings against defaulting tax collectors Gaulden v

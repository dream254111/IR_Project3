blastblase wie ich den primaren Epiblastv von dem sich durch Abspaltung der Epi blast des Fruchthofes nach innen abhebt zu benennen vorschlug Again in the article on the placentation of Ertnaceus in Vol 30 Pt 3 1889 of the Quart Journ of Microsc Science where the definition was reproducedT it is insisted upon p 298 that the use of the name trophoblast will render unnecessary such circumlocutory expressions as outer epiblastic layer of the blastocyst priini tive exochorion  etc  Further argu mentation on p 299 in which the allan toidean and the omphaloidean trophoblast is defined leaves not the faintest doubt as to what the name trophoblast has originally stood for Five years later 1894 in an article Spolia nemoris which appeared in Vol 36 of the Quart Journ of Micr Science I again insisted p 111  that  new and valid reasons are thus aecumulated for designating the outer layer of precociously segregated epiblast cells that form the wall of this vesiclb the early mammalian blasto cyst by a separate name for which I have proposed the name of trophoblast  Somewhat further is added p 112 in Tupaja and Tarsius portions of the tropho blast undergo very active proliferating rocesses preparatory to the placentary fixation of the blastocyst whereas in my former papers I have described the same activity for Wrinaceus and Sorex Finally in 1895  Verhandl der Kon Akad v Wetenschoppee

the Anatomical Congress at Wurzburg in 1888 and its earliest definition is found in the report of that meeting in Nos 17 and 18 of the Anatomqscher Arwzeiger Bd III We there read concerning a very early stage of the hedgehog p 510  Die aussere Wand der Keimblase ist verdickt drei bis vierschichtig und be sitzt wabige Ijacunen Fur diese aussere epiblastische Schicht sei der Name Tro phob1vast

SCIENCE N S VOL XX NO 507 die von mir Trophoblast genannte Keim schicht ist    die aussere schicht der Saugethierkeimblase welche vor der defini tiven Ausbildung des formativen Epiblastes dieses sowie die Hypoblastanlage umhullt und an der Bildung des Embryos uber haupt keinen Antheil nimmt In this last paper I have for the first time asserted that in my opinion the Sauro psidan arrangement as well as that of the Ornithodelphia can not possibly be looked upon as aneestral to what we find in the monodelphic and didelphie mammalia and that on the eontrary the trophoblast 1 c p 57 No 7 is a

and the  Deek sehieht  in amphibian development and have also drawn attention to those eases where remnants of a trophoblastie layer eould be deteeted in the Sauropsida Only in 1902 however have I gone yet further baek and leaving the reeent am phibia out of the aneestral line I have attempted to draw a eomparison between the trophoblast and the other etal mem branes eoexistent with it of the Amniota and larval envelopes of invertebrate prede eessors Ver7wand1 der Koqw A7cld v Wet erbschJappeqt te Amsterdant Vol VIII No 6 1902 p 53  Alinea  It has now been shown that sinee the first introduetion oE the name tropEoblclst sixteen years ago my own definition and interpretation of it has not undergone any alteration although ad vanees have been made in the appreeiation of its theoretieal signifieanee And it is for this reason diffieult or me to understand that the name has been mis understood both by embryologists and by gynseeologists even to sueh an extent that the writing of the present artiele seems neeessary to prevent further eonfusion So for example Charles S Minots defi nition of the trophoblast on p 100 of his  Ijaboratory Textbook of Ernbryology  1903 as a special layer of cells developed on the outer surface of the ectoderm of the mammalian blastodermic vesicle  is both wrong and misleading Several statements in the same paragraph on p 107 e g that the trophoblast is sometimes developed only later that it disappears when the placenta is being formed etc are likewise in com plete disaeeordance with the original de nition such as it was substantiated by the different quotations given above In attempting to explain for myself how Alinot ean have fallen into this error from which eonsultation of the papers above quoted would have withheld him I ean not but suppose that Bonnets  Grundriss der Entwekelung der Haus saugethiere  must have led him astray In this we find on p 31 a woodeut Fig 17  in whieh the trolhoblast Bonnet s primarer Ectoblast is represented as a separate layer outside of the eetoderm of the monodermic blastoeyst of the hedge hog and whieh woodeut is marked naeh Hubreeht  although I never published anything of the kind nor in my writings haye ever as we have seen above given the slightest justfieation to an interpretation so entirely ineonsistent with my own views whieh have repeatedly been expressed with out any ambiguity Already on p lf of my paper of 1895 have I ealled atten tion to the faet that E3ounets wooldeut was a misrepresentation of my wn views and have on Plate IV Fig 81

quotations may dispel eventual doubtsabout thesignifieanee of the term trolphoblast I have now to eonsider the applieation of that term in gyneeology more especially its applieation to the plaeentation of man and of other mammals I find that its use has beeome more general vvith English and Ameriean than with German authors and at the same time it would seem as if also in this ease a bendeney to misunder stand the real signifieance of the term has sprurlg up This tendeney is very naturally ex plained when we eonsi4er how important a faetor for the proeess of plaeentation the proliferation of trophoblast eells has been shown to be This proliferation is espe eially very lusurious in wnan Siegenbeek van Heukelom Peters in the hedgehog Iffubreeht whereas in many other in seetivora and rodents its multiform compli eations are exeeedingly varied In eonse qtlenee many investigetors have been led to believe that the name trophoblast was originally restrieted to those proliferating iregions whereas we have demonstrated above that this has never been so Add to this that the proliferation of eells eon tributing to the formation of the plaeenta yet in another way is apt to lead to eonfu sion because such proliferation is in no way limited to embryonic cells but is also noticed sometimes tto a more considerable extentin maternal cells belonging to the epithelial lining of the uterus or to the subepithelial maternal tissues In this way debates have arisen between Strahl and370 SCI13NCE N S VOLXX NO 507 Ijusebrink on one side and Duval van Beneden and myself on the other of which debates the object was to make out in how far the material of the proliferating pla centa should be looked upon as maternal and in how far as embryonie trophoblastic tissue These debates will no doubt in the course of time as the number of carefully ob servesd cases inereases lead to a unanimous interpretation As it was I have myself for sheer diffldence of attributing too prom inent a part to trophoblastic proliferation of which I was nevertheless together with Duval the first advocate  in one case stopped short of the real solution and have for the hedgehog restrieted the extent of the trophoblast more than was necessary Since then I have corrected this in a doetor dissertation of one of my pupils Resink 1903  but there is no doubt that I am myself thus responsible for a certain amount of vagueness  and misrepresenta tion which has prevailed in the application of the term trophoblast to different pla centas more particularly of man and the monkeys where the question arose in how far certain syneytial tissues should be looked upon as maternal or as embryonie Even for pathological anatomy this proved to be a momentous question in so far as the deciduoma malignum if traced to remains of trophoblast cells would be very different from other deciduomse that found their origin in maternal tissue Now that the placentation of Tarstus Txpaja Forex Vesperttlto Cercocebus Talpa GaleopttSecus Scturus Lepus a o has been more carefully examined tropho blastic proliferation having been figured by Selenka as early as 1887 for one of the Didelphia Opossum  divergence of opin ion will in a few years hence have been replaced by unanimity also on this head And then the appliGation of the name trophoblast to those placental elements that arise from the embryonic layer originally designated by that name will be in no vvay confusing but will on the contraxy con tribute to keep before our eyes the intimate relation between the facts as they take place under our eyes and their phylogenetic   orlgln Vith perfect justifieation Strahl has pro tested Hertwigs Handbuch der Ent wickelungslehre der Wirbelthiere I 2 p 311 against a misapplication of the term inology which I have attempted once more to explain in this artiele when authers who have insuffieiently studied the subject even D0 SO far as to speak of a maternal tropho 13last beside the embryonic  I hope that this paper may henceforth render misinterpretations such as are dis eussed in it impossible A A W HUBRECHT U1NIVERSITY 0F UTRECHT SCII3NTIFlC BOOKS reograpitc InAliences tn

enter the government service while others will become instructors in institutions of learning or be engaged as experts in private capacity This will avoid competition with other institutions will give most valuable training and practical experience to stu dents and will be especially helpful to in structors in educational institutions who might wisely be sent for six months or a year to Washington as at present some are sent abroad There should be no thought of providing a general or liberal course of education Coming as student assistants there should be opportunities and encour agement only on clearly defined lines of study and investigation There are many large and small problems to be worked out by the officers of the Washington Memorial Institution but with the skilled educator and organizer now at its head as director their successful solution is only a matter of time It is anticipated that the Wash ington Memorial Institution will under the direction of Dr Gilman begin its work by November 1 1901 The Governments part in the work when once under successful headway will be to enlarge the quarters of the various bu reaus concerned This will be necessary eventually even if no student assistants are provided for The Government has done its part nobly so far It is now for the edu cational institutions of the country to come forward and assist by setting a high stand ard of scholarship for admission to the privilege of becoming a student assistant in the Government bureaus Only students of the type of those who win fellowships or excel in ability should be certified or accepted The Washington Memorial Institution should and I believe will maintain a standard that will meet the approval of our colleges and universities It should occupy a most important place in the great educa tional work of the country With the hearty cooperation of our collegiate institu tions and of the officers of the Government there is little question that it will ulti mately become the federated head and clearinghouse of all the higher educational interests of the country The relations of the National Govern ment to higher education and research are intimate and complex but the complexi ties are already partially resolved the present is auspicious and the future out look is most promising Long ago the na tion recognized its obligation to promote a higher and more extended policy than is embraced in the protection of the temporal interests and political rights of the indi vidual The action of Congress in the present year in opening the Government bureaus at Washington for study and re search is a long stride forward and if carried out in good faith must result in another and higher standard for American endeavor CHARLES D WALCOTT U S GEOLOGICAL SURVEY THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF CANADA THE twentieth general meeting of the Royal Society of Canada was held in Ot tawa May 21 22 and 23 1901 This is essentially a national institution It was founded in 1882 by the Marquis of Lorne now His Grace the Duke of Argyll The Society is divided into four sections I French Literature History and allied subjects II English Literature History and allied sub jects III Mathematical Physical and Chemical Sciences IV Geological and Biological Sciences The Society met this year under the presi dency of Dr Louis Honor6 Fr6chette CMG who delivered his inaugural ad dress Race and Language Problem in 1015SCIENCE Canada on the evening of Tuesday May 21 before a large audience The various sections met for the transaction of business and reading of papers Delegates from affiliated literary scientific and historical societies throughout Canada presented their reports and many of them took part in the deliberations of the Society The report of Council for 1901 presented by the Honorary Secretary Sir John George Bourinot KCMG historian besides con taining an account of the business affairs of the Society regarding the election of four new fellows the diplomas of fellowship the death of the Queen and the accession of King Edward VII the associated societies and the proposed meeting in Toronto in 1902 dealt a heavy blow upon the circula tion of yellow journals of the United States and in general The question of establishing public libraries the care of the Dominion archives the Canadian Marine Biological Station Nova Scotian and New Brunswick archives tidal investigations together with the question of publishing historical memoirs and diaries received at tention as well as the question of preserv ation of places of scenic and historic inter est including the site of Louisbourg and the Plains of Abraham The report also contained biographical sketches of the late fellows Hon F X Marchand and Dr George Mercer Dawson In accordance with a suggestion con tained in the honorary secretarys report of last year to prepare a record of Canadian publications embraced under the several sections of the Royal Society the following committee of Section IV which was ap pointed in May 1900 reported viz For ge ology and paleontology Dr H M Ami for general zoology exclusive of entomology Dr J F Whiteaves entomology Dr C J

in 1900 This memorial of the first president of the Royal Society of Canada was read by title and ordered to be printed in extenso together with Dr Amis completed List of Writings of Sir William Dawson The Carboniferous Basin in New Brunswick R W ELLS LLD of the Geological Sur vey of Canada The Carboniferous rocks in New Bruns wick embrace an area of not far from 12000 square miles They occur in a roughly tri angularshaped basin which extends from the Gulf of St Lawrence on the east as a base nearly to the southwest boundary of the province At a number of points beds of coal are found but these in so far as yet ex amined are thin ranging from a very few inches to about two feet in thickness Bor ings have been made from time to time for over sixty years to ascertain the presence of thicker or more workable beds but owing to various causes such attempts have not yet been successful The greater portion of the area however has not yet been proved The paper will briefly state some of the principal conclusions arrived at regarding the structure of this basin during the last thirty years and will indicate the rela tions of the Carboniferous sediments to the rocks of the underlying formations In the discussion which followed Dr Bailey pointed out that the Legislature of New Brunswick had granted a subsidy for the purpose of developing the coalbearing areas of the Grand Lake District Dr Matthew maintained that there was con siderable chance of discovering suitable coal seams in New Brunswick and argued that something should be done to ascertain their possible existence Dr Ami stated that within the Carboniferous Basin of New Brunswick he would include the strata called  fernledges Lancaster formation or  Little River Group which held a flora and fauna of Carboniferous age Notes on Some of the Silurian and Devonian Formations of Eastern Canadaand their Faunas and Floras H M AMI MA DSc FGS From recent studies carried on by the author the succession of the sedimentary formations of both the Silurian and the De vonian Systems in Eastern Canada needs revision and elucidation There are several distinct geological horizons which consti tute as many distinct formations that are as yet unplaced and unnamed in the Cana dian succession and a discussion of the re lations which exist between the different 1017 SCIENCEN S VOL XIII No 339 formations or members of these systems in different portions of Canada was presented The subdivision of the Silurian succession at Arisaig in Antigonish County Nova Scotia those of Gasp6 Anticosti and On tario are included and are based upon the faunas determined by the late Mr Billings and Professor Hall as well as from mate rial in the hands of the author for some years past The subdivisions of typical De vonian formations are also given These will form a basis for the classification of the terranes in eastern Canada according to latest and most approved methods Acrothyra and Hyolithesa comparison With a description of a new species of Hyo lithes G F MATTHEW LLD The comparison was made for the pur pose of seeing how far the muscular system of one genus corresponds to that of the other Theventralvalveof Acrothyra was compared with the tube of Hyolithes and the dorsal valve of the former genus with the operculum of the latter The Iyolithes described is a slender species from the base of the Paradoxides bed at St John On some Modes of Occurrence of the Mineral Albertite Professor L W BAILEY LLD of New Brunswick University Since the closing of the celebrated Albert Mines in Albert county New Brunswick the ownership of which for a time hinged upon the determination of whether the mineral which thence derived its name should be regarded as coal or asphalta number of interesting observations have been accumulating which have a direct bear ing upon this question The present paper narrates and discusses some of these ob servations and is accompanied by speci mens illustrating the occurrence of the mineral with widely different associations and in rocks of quite different geological horizons e g in PreCambrian slates in calcareobituminous shales in gray Car boniferous sandstones in snow alabaster in admixtures of calcite and pyrite and cementing crystals of selenite The vein like nature of the mineral and its originally fluid or semifluid condition are strongly emphasized In the discussion which fol lowed Dr Ells Dr Ami and Mr Poole took part Dr Ells places the Albert shales in the Devonian System Dr Ami argued for the EoCarboniferous age as shown by fish remains and plants JacquesPhilippe Cornuti Notes pour servir a histoire des sciences au Canada Par MGR LAFLAMME Cornuti a public a Paris en 1635 un volume qui renferme la description dun bon nombre de

et la nomenclature actuelle On some Geological Correlations in New Brunswick Professor BAILEY LLD of New Brunswick University While the geological age of the rock for mations in New Brunswick has in most in stances been determined upon satisfactory evidence much uncertainty has existed re garding certain groups of strata and espe cially those which consisting largely of slaty rocks border the great central granite axis which traverses the central part of the province in the counties of York Carleton Northumberland and Gloucester For though regarded originally as Cambrian by Gesner Robb Logan Hind and others and subsequently colored and described though only provisionally in the maps and reports of the Geological Survey as Cambro 1018 SCIENCESCIENCE Silurian the only fossils found therein at widely separated points were with a single exception where an Ordovician fauna oc curs such as to indicate a much more re cent Silurian or Devonian horizon In the investigation of the problems arising from this fact and in the effort to deter mine upon behalf of the Geological Survey more exact knowledge as to what systems were actually present and their relative limits the author of this paper was during the past summer fortunate in being able to obtain evidence in the discovery of cer tain graptolitic strata tending to confirm the original view that large portions of the belts in question are really of Cambrian age with a probability that other large areas are still older representing either the Etcheminian formation so called of Mat thew or the Huronian of other writers The facts relating to these observations which have a bearing upon questions of a farreaching character in relation to Acadian geology are in this paper briefly summar ized and discussed On the Subdivisions of the Cambrian System in Canada H M AMI MA DSc FGS of the Geological Survey of Canada This paper discusses the various geolog ical formationds which naturally fall under the Cambrian system in British North America An attempt is made to present a systematic table giving the succession of the different faunas of this system and the different formations under which each falls The main object of this paper is to bring the nomenclature of this system to date with a view of classifying the organic re mains comprised within its linits with a brief discussion as to these limits A Backward Step in Paleobotany G F MATTHEW LLD This is a review of the attempt made to claim the plant beds in the Little River Group and their flora and so the whole 1019 terrane as Carboniferous This claim is made on Paleobotanical grounds by Messrs D White R Kidston and H M Ami The article recites the stratigraphical and physical objections to this view and in this connection two sections near St John are given showing the relation of this terrane to the lower Carboniferous The fauna of the plant beds is reviewed and it is sug gested that even from this point of view there is not sufficient evidence to overthrow the result arrived at by those who had previously studied the flora and the stra tigraphy Dr Bailey Dr Ells Mr H S Poole and Dr Ami took part in the discussion which followed the reading of this paper The first three gentlemen brought forth all the arguments possible bearing on the De vonian age of the plant beds in question Dr Ami pointed out the synchronism exist ing between these beds and the Carbonifer ous strata of other parts of North America and Europe Notes on Some Butterflies from Western Canada Dr JAMES FLETCHER Donminion Entomologist This paper described

Value of Nature Study in Practical Edu cation Dr JAMES FLETCHER Dominion Entomologist to the Central Experimental Station at Ottawa In his opening remarks Dr Fletcher said that he was thankful that the educators of the youth in every province of Canada have shown that they keenly appreciate the value of natural history studies as an integral and effective part of a practical education He would appeal more especially now to the educated classes of Canada amongst whom it must be acknowledged there is an appal ling and unnecessary ignorance upon many useful branches of knowledge some infor mation upon which would make them far better citizens and more efficient competi tors in whatever branch of work they may have adopted as the means of obtaining a livelihood There is no profession trade or occupation in which definite or exact knowledge is not daily required with regard to subjects the consideration of which comes within the scope of some branch of natural science The last halfdecade has seen a bright awakening to the realization of the value of nature studies as a means of cul tivating the faculties of the youth of every land where progress is made To teach the child the beginnings of things the elements of knowledge through the common things about us will lead it to want to see to know and understand and hence think carefully with a view of drawing right conclusions The flowers birds and insects furnish as many and useful objects for the grandest the simplest and best lessons in educating the youth of our land Whether they are beneficial or injurious and why so will lead the observing student to find out their uses and recognize whether they have or have not as yet been recognized Sym pathy and kindness are the outcome of na ture studies likewise healthful enjoyment Principles of perfection appear wherever nature has not been interfered with A perfect method and system is revealed and well may those entrusted with the educa tion of others turn to these natural models to inculcate those principles so necessary to developthe mind Amongst the interesting exhibits shown during the meetings of the Royal Society was a plan of the new museum known as the Victoria Memorial Museum to be erected in Ottawa at once Through the kindness and courtesy of the Honorable Mr Tarte Minister of Public Works the plans were placed on exhibition in the Normal School building where the Royal Society was holding its meetings The building has a frontage of 322 feet and is 188 feet deep with a tower dome in the center It is intended to accommo date the collections at present stored in the unsafe building occupied by the Geological Survey Department on Sussex Street Ot tawa comprising minerals ores fossils plants trees and other natural history objects as specimens illustrating the natural resources of Canada also the Fishery ex hibit now on OConnor Street and the paint ings in the Art Gallery A resolution passed by the Royal Society of Canada and transmitted to the Government of Canada congratulated the latter on its wise action On May 22 a resolution was passed ap proving and supporting Capt F Bernier of Quebec City who is taking charge of the expedition to the North Pole An inter esting discussion followed in which many Fellows took part including G H Parkin CMG Sir Sandford Fleming Dr R Bell 1020 SCIENCEJUNE 28 1901 FRS and

London Act 1898 and the statutes and regulations framed in pursuance thereof the longstanding con troversy as to the form and organization of the London University was finally disposed of The various colleges and other institu tions doing university work within the met ropolitan area have been coordinated under a strong and representative senate which is charged with the duty of providing for the six millions of inhabitants within a ra dius of 30 miles from the University build ing every kind of instruction of university type To enable the reorganized London University to cope with this gigantic task the Chancellor of the Exchequer frankly  From the London Times confesses his inability to do more than pro vide the office expenses If London wants a teaching university London says the Chancellor must pay for it In the special financial circumstances of the moment this appeal to publicspirited Londoners can scarcely be considered unreasonable The task of equipping and endowing a University can never be a small one and the extent and variety of the needs of Lon don might daunt the munificence even of an American millionaire Fortunately we do not have to start quite from the begin ning The organization and constitutional framework are completed and stand ready to start A large part of the materials for a University worthy even of the capital of the Empire only await the hand of the master builder What is wanted is first a comprehensive survey of the field and an appreciation of the amount and variety of the work to be done Upon this must follow the motive power of money The new university is organized in eight faculties namely theology arts music law medicine science engineering and economics and political science includ ing commerce and industry But though provision is thus made for all branches of University study old and new it is already clear that London University will have a character of its own The distinctive note of the University is evidently destined to be that of applied science or the concrete application to every branch of industrial and social life of the discoveries and laws of the various sciences It is this side of university organization that we must there fore first consider In physical science the London Univer sity holds an honorable tradition as hav ing been the first to create a science degree At present the University includes three  schools  of science for men and two more Bedford and Halloway for women only Of these the Royal College of Science fully SCIENCE 1021

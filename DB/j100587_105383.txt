LYNCURIUM OF THE ANCIENTS BY WILLIAM WATSON M D F R S TO DETERMINE THE SUBSTANCE DENO MINATED LYNCURIUM BY THE ANCIENTS HAS BEEN THE OCCASION OF MUCH CONTROVERSY AMONG THE MORE MODERN NATURALISTS SOME OF WHOM AS LATE DR WOODWARD BELIEVED IT TO BE A SPECIES OF THE BELEMNITES OTHERS AS THE LATE  M GEOFFROY CONSI DERED IT AS AMBER BUT IT IS EVIDENT FROM  THEOPHRAS TUSS DESCRIPTION OF THE LYNCURIUM WHICH IS THE MOST COMPLETE THAT HAS BEEN HANDED DOWN TO US THAT NEI THER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER OF THE BEFOREMENTIONED SUBSTANCES COULD BE WHAT HE INTENDED HIS WORDS ARE                      FROM HENCE WE LEARN THAT THE LYNCURIUM WAS A STONE  USED FOR ENGRAVING SEALS ON THAT IT WAS VERY HARD  THAT IT WAS ENDOWED WITH AN ATTRACTING POWER LIKE  AMBER AND THAT IT WAS SAID AND BY DIOCLES  AMONG THE REST TO ATTRACT NOT ONLY STRAWS AND  SMALL PIECES OF WOOD BUT ALSO COPPER AND IRON IF  BEATEN VERY THIN THAT IT WAS PELLUCID AND OF A  MATER MED VOL I P 165 DE SUCCINO IDEM ET LYNCURIUM QUOQUE DICITUR  THEOPHRASTUS     DEEP READ DEC 20 1759395  DEEPRED COLOUR AND REQUIRED NO SMALL LABOUR TO  POLISH IT THE REST OF THEOPHRASTUSS DESCRIPTION IS TAKEN UP WITH THE FABULOUS ACCOUNT OF THE GENERA TION OF THIS STONE THAT IT IS FORMED BY THE URINE OF  THE LYNX WHICH THE ANIMAL AS SOON AS IT PARTS  WITH IT HIDES AND SCRAPES THE EARTH TOGETHER OVER  IT AND THAT THE STONES VARY ACCORDING TO THE SEX  AND DISPOSITION OF THE ANIMAL DIOSCORIDES  IN HIS HISTORY OF THE LYNCURIUM GIVES US ONLY THE FABULOUS HISTORY OF ITS GENERATION BEFORE MENTIONED BY THEOPHRASTUS AND SUBJOINS THAT IT IS CALLED BY SOME   THAT IS AMBER WHICH ATTRACTS FEATHERS TO IT PLINY IN HIS HISTORY  DISBELIEVES BOTH THE FABU LOUS ACCOUNT OF THE GENERATION OF THE LYNCURIUM AS WELL AS ITS ATTRACTIVE QUALITY RELATED BOTH BY DIOCLES AND THEOPHRASTUS AND CONSIDERS THE WHOLE AS A FALSITY THOUGH HE IS CANDID ENOUGH TO CONFESS THAT NEITHER HIMSELF NOR ANY ONE ELSE IN THAT AGE HAD SEEN A GEM OF THAT APPELLATION THEOPHRASTUS THOUGH MORE ANCIENT IS IN MOST PARTICULARS MORE TO BE DEPENDED UPON THAN EITHER DIOSCORIDES OR PLINY HE OUGHT TO BE CONSIDERED MUCH MORE OF AN ORIGINAL AUTHOR AND ONE WHO WROTE FROM HIS OWN KNOWLEGE THAN THE OTHERS WHO VA LUABLE AS THEY ARE MUST BE REGARDED IN MOST RESPECTS AS COMPILERS HIS ACCOUNT THEN OF THE APPEARANCE AND PROPERTIES OF THE LYNCURIUM MUST BE CONSIDERED IN ORDER TO EXAMINE IF ANY SUBSTANCE KNOWN IN OUR  LIB II CAP C  PLIN HIST LIB XXXVII CAP III EGO FALSUM ID TOTUM ARBI TOR NEC VISUM IN AEVO NOSTRO GEMMAM ULLAM EA APPELLATIONE E E E 2 TIME396 TIME ANSWERS HIS DESCRIPTION BUT FIRST IT IS PLAIN THAT DR WOODWARDS HYPOTHESIS OF THE BELEM NITES BEING THE LYNCURIUM WAS ILL FOUNDED INAS MUCH AS THE BELEMNITES IS NEITHER PELLUCID NOR FIT FOR ENGRAVING SEALS UPON ON ACCOUNT OF THE FRIABILITY OF ITS TEXTURE NEITHER CAN IT BY ANY MANAGEMENT BE MADE TO ATTRACT STRAWS CHIPS OF WOODS OR OTHER LIGHT BODIES NOR IS GEOFFROYS OPINION LESS LIABLE TO EXCEPTION AS AMBER THOUGH IT HAS THE ATTRACTIVE POWER MENTIONED BY THEOPHRASTUS YET IT HAS BY NO MEANS THE FIRM TEXTURE REQUISITE TO HAVE SEALS ENGRAVED UPON IT NEITHER IS IT SO VERY HARD AS IS EXPRESLY SAID BY THIS AUTHOR CONCERNING THE LYNCURIUM AS TO RE QUIRE GREAT LABOUR IN POLISHING IT ADD TO THESE THAT THEOPHRASTUS HAS GIVEN A PARTICULAR ACCOUNT OF THE HISTORY AND PROPERTIES OF AMBER  SEPARATELY IN THE BEFOREMENTIONED WORK IF AFTER WHAT HAS BEEN SAID I MAY BE PERMITTED TO GIVE MY THOUGHTS CONCERNING THE LYNCURIUM OF THE ANCIENTS I MAKE NO SCRUPLE TO THINK IT TO BE EXCEED INGLY PROBABLE THAT WHAT WE NOW CALL THE TOURMA LINE WAS THE LYNCURIUM OF THEOPHRASTUS AS IT AGREES WITH THAT AUTHORS DESCRIPTION IN ALL ITS SENSIBLE QUA LITIES TO WIT THAT IT IS A VERY HARD PELLUCID STONE OF A DEEPRED COLOUR THAT IT IS VERY PROPER TO ENGRAVE SEALS UPON THAT IT ATTRACTS LIKE AMBER NOT ONLY STRAWS AND LIGHT PIECES OF WOOD BUT FILINGS OF IRON AND BRASS AS HAS BEEN LATELY EVINCED BY MANY EXPE RIMENTS AND WHAT WILL GIVE SOME WEIGHT TO THIS  VIDE THEOPHRAST       OPI397 OPINION IS THAT THIS STONE THOUGH NOT MUCH ATTENDED TO BY US TILL VERY LATELY IS VERY COMMON IN SEVERAL PARTS OF THE EAST INDIES AND MORE PARTICULARLY IN THE ISLAND OF CEYLON WHERE IT IS CALLED BY THE NATIVES TOURNAMAL THE FIRST ACCOUNT WHICH WE HAVE HAD OF LATE YEARS AT LEAST OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY STONE WAS IN THE HI STORY OF THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF PARIS FOR THE YEAR 1717 WHERE WE ARE TOLD THAT MR LEMERY EXHIBITED A STONE WHICH HE SAID WAS NOT COMMON AND CAME FROM CEYLON THIS STONE ATTRACTED AND REPELLED LITTLE LIGHT BODIES SUCH AS ASHES FILINGS OF IRON BITS OF PAPER AND SUCH LIKE THE PUBLISHER OF THAT HISTORY THEN PROCEEDS TO GIVE SOME REASONS FOR THESE PHAENOMENA LINNAEUS IN HIS PREFACE TO THE FLORA ZEYLANICA MENTIONS THIS STONE UNDER THE NAME OF LAPIS ELECTRICUS AND TAKES NOTICE OF M LEMERYS EXPERIMENTS BEFOREMENTIONED NOTWITHSTANDING THIS NO FURTHER MENTION WAS MADE OF THIS STONE AND ITS EFFECTS TILL VERY LATELY THE DUKE DE NOYA IN HIS LETTER TO M DE BUFFON WHICH WAS PRESENTED TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY A FEW MONTHS AGO INFORMS US THAT WHEN AT NAPLES IN THE YEAR 1743 THE LATE COUNT PICHETTI SECRETARY TO THE KING ASSURED HIM THAT DURING HIS STAY AT CONSTANTINOPLE HE HAD SEEN A SMALL STONE CALLED A TOURMALINE WHICH ATTRACTED AND REPELLED ASHES THIS ACCOUNT THE DUKE DE NOYA HAD QUITE FORGOT BUT BEING LAST YEAR IN HOLLAND HE SAW AND PURCHASED TWO OF THESE STONES WHICH ARE THERE CALLED ASCHENTRIKKER THE MAKING EXPERIMENTS WITH THESE CALLED TO HIS REMEMBRANCE WHAT FORMERLY HAD BEEN TOLD HIM BY COUNT PICHETTI WITH THESE STONES HE MADE IN COMPANY WITH MES SIEURS398 SIEURS DAUBENTON AND ADANSON A GREAT NUMBER OF EXPERIMENTS OF WHICH THE DUKE HAS FAVOURED THE PUBLIC WITH A PARTICULAR ACCOUNT IN THE YEAR 1757 THERE WERE TWO ACCOUNTS PUB LISHED UPON THIS SUBJECT THE ONE IS A MEMOIR OF M AEPINUS READ TO THE ROYAL ACADEMY AT BERLIN IN TITULED DE QUIBUSDAM EXPERIMENTIS ELECTRICIS NOTABI LIORIBUS THE OTHER IS A TREATISE IN QUARTO PRINTED AT ROSTOCK INTITULED DISPUTATIO DE ELECTRICITATIBUS CONTRARIIS AUCTORE JOANNE CAROLO WILKE SINCE WHICH TIME DR HEBERDEN WHO IS EVER DESIROUS OF EXTENDING THE BOUNDS OF SCIENCE HAVING PROCURED SOME OF THESE STONES FROM HOLLAND A GREAT NUMBER AND VARIETY OF EXPERIMENTS WITH THEM HAVE BEEN MADE HERE PARTICULARLY BY THE INGENIOUS MR WILSON AN ACCOUNT OF WHICH HE HAS VERY LATELY COMMUNICATED TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY

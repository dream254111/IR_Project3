Method of Computing Its Amount,i207049,440 V  On the Effect of Local Attraction upon the Plumbline at stations on the English Arc of the Meridian between Dun nose and Burleigh Moor and a Method of computing its Amount By the Venerable Archdeacon PRATT Com municated by the Rev J CHALLIS FRS Received June 5 1855 The author states that in a former communication he had pointed out a method for calculating the deflection of the plumbline at sta tions on the Indian arc caused by the attraction of the Himalayas and of the vast regions beyond with a view to the correction of the astronomical amplitudes of the measured subdivisions of the arc before they are applied to the determination of the ellipticity of the earth The same subject is taken up in the present paper but in refer ence to the English arc between Dunnose and Burleigh Moor and a different method of calculating the attraction is given The paper consists of three parts In the first the ellipticity of the English arc is calculated without taking account of attraction The arc is divided into five parts and the lengths and amplitudes assigned to them in Mudges Trigonometrical Survey of England vols ii and iii are made the basis of the calculation These por tions of the arc are compared two and two and ten values of the 1 ellipticity thence deduced the mean of which is T438687 The ten values of which this is the mean differ considerably among each other indicating that there is some distuirbing cause like local at traction affecting the plumbline and therefore the apparent lati tudes The variations of the observed amplitudes are then dis cussed and the necessity of calculating the local attraction pointed out In the second part a formula is obtained for calculating the at traction The method is different from that given by the author in his first communication The curvature of the earth is neglected as this would have no sensible effect on the results in the British Isles The attracting mass is divided into a number of smaller masses standing on rectangular bases at the sealevel and the height of each441 is taken equal to the average height of the surface above the sea level The dimensions of the bases may differ from each other and are determined by the contour of the surface in such a way that the average height in each mass may not depart materially from the height of any part of it The investigation leads to the following Rule for determining the horizontal attraction deflection of theplumb line caused by any one of these Tabular Masses as the author calls them RULETake the origin of coordinates at the station where the plumbline is Let the plane of xy be horizontal and the axis of x in the vertical plane in which the amount of deflection is to be found Write down the coordinates XY xy of the furthest and nearest angles of the Tabular Mass from the origin Y is always to be considered  ve and y  ve or ve accordingly Form four ratios by first dividing each ordinate by the abscissa not belonging to it and then by dividing each ordinate by its own abscissa vzz Y y Y y Look in a Table of Tangents for the four angles of which the tan gents equal the above ratios Form four more angles by adding subtracting if they be negative half of each of these angles just found to orfrom 45 From the sum of the logtangents of the first two of these angles subtract the sum of the logtangents of the second two 1It This result multiplied by H feet and by 369 will give the required deflection of the plumbline in seconds of a degreeH 1being the height of the Tabular Mass above the sealevel and its density being taken equal to half the mean density of the earth which is that of granite The only restriction to be attended to in the application of this Rule is that the ratio of the height of the attracted station above the sea to each of the horizontal coordinates of the nearest angle of the Tabular Mass must be so small that its square may be neglected If any part of the attracting mass is nearer to the station than this it must be divided into vertical prisms and the attraction of each found for which the author gives a formula in a note442 In the third part the Rule is applied for the purpose of illustra tion to obtain an approximate value of the deflection of the plumb line at Burleigh Moor the north station of the arc under considera tion situated on the north coast of Yorkshire The deflection is found to be 3644 to the south The data upon which this calcula tion is based are gathered by the author from the Map wlhich accom panies General Mutdges account of the English Survey and the heights marked down on that map The deflection at several other stations is deduced from this result of calculation by using the amplitudes given in Mudges work and also in Captain Yollands IAstronomical Observations made with Airys Zenith Sector published in 1852 and by supposing the cur vature of the meridian to be the mean curvature of the whole globe as laid down by Mr Airy in his article on the Figure of the Earth Thus the deflection at Black Dowin on the Dorsetshire coast one of the places mentioned in Captain Yollands volume the author finds to be 5f 886 to the north a quantity which tallies well with the de flection assigned to Burleigh Moor on the Yorkshire coast if the re lative heights of the two coasts are compared This affords a satis factory evidence of the correctness of the principles laid down in the paper and as the author thinks makes the subject well worthy the attention of those who are interested in the English Survey and who have it in their power to furnish the most accurate data for the application of the Rule he lays down The subject is also no less important to the mathematician in his investigation of the figure of the earth In a Postscript the author makes the following remarks upon the Astronomer Royals method of accounting for the large amount of deflection on the Indian arc deduced by the author in his former communication Since the above was written I have had the opportunity of see ing a notice of the communication of the Astronomer Royal on the Density of Tablelands supposed to be supported by a dense fluid or semifluid mass and the use he makes of his suggestions to remove the discrepancy pointed out in my first communication between the values of the deflection of the plumbline in India as determined by calculating the attraction of the Himalayas and as indicated by the results of the Great Trigonometrical Survey The following diffi443 culties occur to me in the way of this highly ingenious and philoso phical method of removing the discrepancy  1 It assumes that the hard crust of the earth is sensibly lighter than the fluid or semifluid mass imagined to be a few miles below the surface But I know of no law except the unique law of water and ice which would lead us to suppose that the fluid mass in con solidating would expand and become lighter One would rather expect it to become denser by loss of heat and mutual approxima tion of its particles  2 There is moreover every reason to suppose that the crust of the earth has long been so thick that the position of its parts relatively to a mean level cannot be any longer subject to the laws of floatation If the elevations and depressions of the earths surface have always remained exactly what they were at the time when the laws of floatation ceased to have an uncontrolled effect then the same reasoning would no doubt apply in our case as if they still had their full sway But geology shows that other laws are in constant operation arising most probably as Mr Babbage has suggested from the expansion and contraction of the solid materials of the crust which change the relative levels of the various parts of the earths surface quite irrespectively of the laws of floatation If Mr Hopkinss estimate of the thickness of the crust be correct viz at least 1000 miles these laws of change in the surface must have been in operation for such an enormous interval of time as quite to obliterate any traces of the form of surface which the simple prin ciples of hydrostatics would occasion Indeed it seems to me highly probable that the elevation of the Himalayas and the vast regions beyond may have arisen altogether from the slow upheaving force arising from this cause el I am inclined to think that the only explanation of the discre pancy between my calculations and the results of the Indian Survey is to be found in the greater curvature of the Indian Arc VOL VI 2 T

corporations to facilitate trans fers of shares of their stocks at markets distant from their home offices and to protect themselves against fraudulent overissues of their stocks erroneous duplications of outstand ing certificates and unwarranted transfers of shares of stock has resulted in the very general custom of appointing trust com panies and banks as transfer agents A transfer agent acts for a corporation in the matter of making transfers of the owner ship ofstock of the corporation from one holder to another This involves passing upon the legality and regularity of the as signments of title noting the transactions upon the books of the corporation canceling the old certificates and issuing new cer tificates in their places The fact that competing State corpo rations very generally exercise this important function has led to a desire on the part of many national banks to do the same and for some time it has been a mooted question whether na tional banks may act as transfer agents National banks derive their powers from two main sources The National Bank Act 2 and the Federal Reserve Act3 The National Bank Act 4 authorizes each national bank To exercise by its board of directors or duly authorized of ficers or agents subject to law all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking by discounting and negotiating promissory notes drafts bills of exchange and other evidences of debt by receiv ing deposits by buying and selling exchange coin and bullion by loaning money on personal security and by In publishing this article the writer wishes to acknowledge the very valuable assistance of the late R Keesee Blakey in digesting the many cases relating to the meaning of the terms fiduciary capacity fiduciary relation

the powers expressly granted and those necessarily incidental5 The provision of the Federal Reserve Act which is pertinent to this discussion is Section 11 k which broadened the pow ers of national banks by permitting them under certain condi tions to exercise certain socalled trust company powers and thus to meet the competition of State corporations which trans act a trust company business in addition to a regular banking business IMPLIED POWER It has been suggested that national banks may act as transfer agents without any specific statutory authority on the ground that to do so is incidental to their banking business In an early Pennsylvania case decided in 18466 it was held that banks although not specifically authorized to do so have implied power to act as transfer agents on the ground that such power is within the necessary implication of all bank char ters since long and unquestioned usage and custom prove that it is a necessary or usual function in the transaction of a bank ing business In a suit by the Bank of Kentucky against the Schuylkill Bank to recover for fraudulent issues of stock by the respondent while acting as transfer agent of the complainant the respond ent sought to repudiate the contract of employment as transfer agent on the ground that it was ultra vires The court overruled the contention and held that the respondent had implied power to act as transfer agent In the course of a long and learned opinion the President of the court said The counsel of the defendants claiming to represent the cor poration repudiate such a contract as a thing pertaining to none of the proper facilities of a bank and as discrepant with the spirit of its charter which interdicts the corpora 5 Logan County National Bank v Townsend 139 U S 67 6 Bank of Kentucky z Schuylkill Bank 1 Pars Eq Cas Pa 180 595VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW tion from buying or selling merchandise or stock It is compared to a general mercantile agency which the bank confessedly could not lawfully execute    What is a transfer agency It is a very harmless thing It amounts to nothing more than the witnessing of the con veyance by one person to another of personal property viz stock of an incorporated company and in this case also to furnishing the purchaser a certificate of ownership of such stock on the surrender of a previous certificate of like char acter held by the seller This is very simple business in volving little or no risk or hazard requiring nothing but ordinary care and fidelity in its performance If the neces sities of one bank require its stock to be transferable in an other place whether in the state of its creation or out of it why cannot it ask aid of a correspondent bank that does all its other business in such a place And why cannot such correspondent bank afford the aid required In the char ter of the Schuylkill Bank there is found nothing in terms forbidding the execution of such a friendly office either to another bank of our own or of a sister state For let it be remembered that if it is unlawful for a bank to act as trans fer agent for another it is immaterial whether that other is a bank of our own or of another state It is the want of congruity with banking functions that must make such a contract illegal not the locality of the corporation for which the business is done If not expressly forbidden any implied interdiction must spring from not being a con tract necessary or usual in the course of banking business To this extent the implied power of making contracts resi dent in all corporations goes Angell  Ames 200    So far as respects the corporation of the Schuylkill Bank the material question is whether a contract entered into by her directory agreeing to accept such an agency for an other bank was an usual and accustomed contract among banks that maintain general business relations with each other Such usages spring out of necessities and are the best evidence of them As the customs and usages of trade are part and parcel of every mercantile contract so a course of uniform usage in favor of a particular course of busi ness prevailing among all banks foreign and domestic known to every business man never called in question by government never repudiated by stockholders is stringent evidence of such a course of business being within the nec essary implications of all bank charters    596NATIONAL BANKS AS TRANSFER AGENTS After reviewing testimony showing that banks in Philadel phia and New York commonly acted as transfer agents for other banks without their power to do so ever being questioned the learned Judge continued    At this time the Philadelphia Bank is acting as transfer agent of the debt of the United States without we presume any idea being entertained by the bank direc tors that they have forfeited their charter by the acceptance of such an agency or by the government that the corporate funds of the institution are not responsible for any fraud or neglect in the execution of the trust   In this connection the fact may be referred to that the original and late Bank of the United States acted as a Commissioner of Loans for the government and that the Bank of Pennsylvania is by law the transfer agent of the State stock These duties were indeed imposed on these institutions as charter duties by government but this manifests the general impression of the congruity of such functions with bank operations In the face of an usage so broad and general prevailing alike at home and abroad it would be a harsh rule that would now declare such con tracts void and the charters of these banks forfeit which have entered into them in good faith resting on the uni versality of such contracts among banks and the general acquiescence of government in this regularity    In a case so circumstanced if the court doubted this ques tion which they do not they would follow the prudent pre cedent of Chancellor Kent in the Silver Lake v North and leave the government to determine whether a forfei ture should be executed rather than in a collateral way de cide a question of misuse by setting aside a just and bona fide contract       We have thus progressed in this investigation until we have ascertained that the contract for the creation of the Philadelphia agency of the Bank of Kentucky was if in fact entered into a perfectly lawful contract in both contracting parties inconsistent with no law of either state and perfectly within the legitimate scope of author ity possessed by the directors of both banks    Whilethe bank involved in that case was not a national bank and therefore the case might not be considered sufficient au thority to justify the conclusion that the power to act as trans 597VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW fer agent is a power which is necessarily incidental to the pow ers specifically conferred upon national banks by the National Bank Act yet the case would seem at least sufficient to justify the conclusion that acting as transfer agent is a function which has been commonly performed by banks for many years and the performance of which is not at all incongruous with the ordinary business of banking EXPRESS POWER UNDER THEI EDERAL RESERVE ACT As will be demonstrated however it is one of the functions of transfer agents to provide additional safeguards with refer ence to the transfer of stocks and to render more certain the de termination of who has title to shares of stock so transferred In view of this fact it is important that the right of a corpora tion selected as transfer agent to act in that capacity should not be open to question and it is very desirable that it should have express power to do so Without deciding whether national banks have implied power to act as transfer agents therefore it is desirable to determine whether they may acquire the power to act in that capacity under the provisions of section 11 k of the Federal Reserve Act HISTORY AND PURPOSE Before attempting to construe that provision it is believed ad visable to review very briefly its history and general purpose7 When Congress was considering the enactment of the Fed eral Reserve Act it found it to be very desirable if not necessary in order to accomplish the purposes of the Act to permit State banks and trust companies to become members of the Federal Reserve System Such institutions however possessed so much broader powers than national banks that they already enjoyed great advantages over national banks and it was feared that if they were afforded the added advantages and prestige of mem bership in the Federal Reserve System national banks would no longer be able to exist in competition with such State institu tions This was fully discussed by the writer in an article entitled Fiduciary Powers of National Banks 6 VA LAW REV 301 598NATIONAL BANKS AS TRANSFER AGENTS One of the most important advantages over national banks which State banks and trust companies enjoyed was the power to transact a trust business in addition to the ordinary banking business Not only was the trust business itself very profitable but their broader powers and complete facilities to handle a great variety of financial business attracted to them many cus tomers They also obtained the banking business of many per sons with whom they came into contact in administering trusts Many of the States had already found it necessary to permit State banks to exercise trust powers in order to meet the com petition of trust companies and for some time it had been rec ognized that national banks were at a distinct disadvantage in not having been granted the same privilege In order to compensate national banks therefore for the ad vantages gained by State banks and trust companies on being admitted to the Federal Reserve System and in order to enable national banks to continue to exist in competition with such State institutions Congress decided to do unto national banks as some of the States had already done as to State banks and to permit them to exercise some of the more important fiduciary powers commonly exercised by trust companies In carrying out this purpose Congress authorized the Federal Reserve Board 8 To grant by special permit to national banks applying there for when not in contravention of State or local law the right to act as trustee executor administrator or registrar of stocks and bonds under such rules and regulations as the said Board may prescribe When the constitutionality of that provision was questioned the Supreme Court of the United States upheld it on the ground that Congress could confer such powers upon national banks in order to enable them to continue to exist in competition with State trust companies and State banks exercising trust powers9 The court further expressed the opinion that the States could not confer trust powers upon corporations which compete with national banks and at the same time deny the right of Congress 8 Sec 11 k of the original Federal Reserve Act o Bank v Fellows 244 U S 416 599600 VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW to enable national banks to meet that competition by exercising the same powers In pursuance of this idea Congress amended Section 11 k so as to enable national banks to act not only in the capacities above mentioned but also as guardians of estates assignees receivers committees of estates of lunatics and in any other fiduciary capacity in which competing State corpora tions are permitted to act under the laws of the State in which the particular national bank is located10 Congress further amended the Act so as to authorize the Federal Reserve Board to permit national banks to act in these fiduciary capacities where competing State corporations are permitted to do so even though the State law expressly forbids national banks to act in such capacities In view of these facts and in view of the general language of the Act as amended it is clear that it was the purpose of Con gress in enacting Section 11 k and in so amending it to put national banks upon an equality with competing State corpora tions so far as the exercise of fiduciary powers is concerned That such was the purpose is further shown by the following statement by Representative Phelan who introduced the bill to amend Section 11 k11 We have endeavored by this amendment to make provision whereby national banks shall be put upon precisely the same footing with reference to these fiduciary powers so far as that can be done by our law with State banks trust conm panies and other competing corporations The Act as amended therefore is clearly a remedial provi sion enacted for the purpose of broadening the powers of na tional banks so as to enable them successfully to meet the com petition of State banks and trust companies and it should be construed liberally in order to effect that purpose Competing State corporations are commonly authorized to act as transfer agents and through the exercise of this privilege ob tain an advantage over national banks in their competition for commercial business Large corporations often place their bank accounts with the banks or trust companies which act as their 10 Act of September 26 1918 1 56 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD 5576NATIONAL BANKS AS TRANSFER AGENTS transfer agents It would seem therefore to be clearly within the spirit of the Act to permit national banks to act as transfer agents and it would seem that the Act should be held to author ize them to act in that capacity if its language is reasonably sus ceptible to that construction CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION 11K Obviously the Board had no power under Section 1lk as originally enacted to authorize a national bank to act as transfer agent since that provision conferred upon the Board power to authorize national banks to act only in four specific capacities as trustee executor administrator and registrar of stocks and bonds and transfer agent was not one of those four capaci ties Expressio unius est exclusio alterius The Board therefore ruled that it had no power under the Act in its orig inal form to authorize national banks to act as transfer agents12 Section 11k of the Federal Reserve Act as amended by the Act of September 26 1918 authorizes the Board To grant by special permit to national banks appying there for when not in contravention of State or local law the right to act as trustee executor administrator registrar of stocks and bonds guardian of estates assignee receiver committee of estates of lunatics or in any other fiduciary capacity in which State banks trust companies or other corporations which come into competition with national banks are permitted to act under the laws of the State in which the national bank is located Inasmuch as the capacity of transfer agent is not one of the capacities specifically mentioned in Section 1lk as amended national banks can act in that capacity under authority of Sec tion 1lk only if it comes within the designation any other fiduciary capacity in which State banks trust companies or other corporations which come into competition with national banks are permitted to act under the laws of the State in which the national bank is located To come within this designation it is necessary that it be 1 a fiduciary capacity within the meaning of Section 1 k and 2 a capacity in which compet 2 2 Fed Res Bulletin 456 601602 VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW ing State corporations are permitted to act under the laws of the State in which the national bank is located The laws of many of the States expressly authorize trust com panies and State banks which are in active competition with na tional banks to act as transfer agents As to those States the whole problem narrows itself down to the question whether or not transfer agents act in a fiduciary capacity within the meaning of Section 1lk MEANING OF FIDUCIARY CAPACITY An extensive search has failed to disclose any case in which it was decided whether or not a transfer agent acts in a fiduciary capacity A study of the authorities however discloses many definitions of the terms fiduciary fiduciary relation fiduci ary character fiduciary capacity etc and many cases decid ing whether or not persons occupying certain positions were act ing in fiduciary capacities or standing in fiduciary relations Upon first examination of such authorities the decisions ap pear to be so

LAW REVIEW there had been a breach of confidence or trust to the injury of the complainant Pomeroy in his work on Equity Jurisprudence14 said The term fiduciary or confidential relation as used in this connection is a very broad one It has been said that it exists and that relief is granted in all cases in which in fluence has been acquired and abusedin which confidence has been reposed and betrayed The 6rigin of the confi dence and the source of the influence are immaterial The rule embraces both technical fiduciary relations and those informal relations which exist whenever one man trusts in and relies upon another The only question is does such a relation in fact exist In Beach v Wiltonl5 where a real estate man trading with a woman seventy years old was held to occupy a fiduciary rela tion Judge Carter said The fiduciary relation exists between parties where there is a relation of trust and confidence between them that is where confidence is reposed by one party and a trust ac cepted by the other    The rule embraces both technical fiduciary relations and those informal relations which exist whenever one man trusts in and relies upon another In Meyer v Reimer 16 it was said A person is said to stand in a fiduciary relation to another when he has rights and powers which he is bound to ex ercise for the benefit of that other person   And generally whenever from the position of the two persons one of them reposes and has a right to repose confidence in the other a fiduciary relation is thereby created and exists And in McKinley v Lynch 17 Judge McWhorter quoted Bige low on Frauds 18 as follows It is difficult to define the term fiduciary relation but it will probably be safe without excluding other possible v Gillespie 59 Mo 220 Simpson v Simpson 80 N

trust continuous or temporary is specially reposed in the skill or integrity of another or the property or pecuniary in terest in the whole or in part or the bodily custody of one person is placed in the charge of another It was pointed out in Studybaker v Cofield 19 that There are certain technical relations that are readily compre hended as fiduciary such as guardian and ward attorney and client priest and communicant etc but there are other relations not falling in either of those specified classes that are in fact fiduciary and conversely it is not every guardian attorney etc quia eo nomine who is to be adjudged to hold a fiduciary relation with the party in regard to a particular subject It is in each case a question of fact And in Smith v Oglivie 20 it was explained that A general definition of the word fiduciary cannot well be given which is sufficiently comprehensive to embrace all cases    It embraces trust confidence and refers to the integrity the fidelity of the party trusted rather than his credit or ability and contemplates good faith rather than legal obligation Pomeroy sums up the situation as to the scope of the term fiduciary relation as used in connection with such equitable remedies as follows 21 Courts of equity have carefully refrained from defining the particular instances of fiduciary relations in such a manner that other and perhaps new cases might be excluded It is settled by an overwhelming weight of authority that the principle extends to every possible case in which a fiduciary relation exists in fact in which there is confidence reposed on one side and the resulting superiority and influence on the other The relation and the duties involved in it need not be legal It may be moral social domestic or merely personal The use of the term fiduciary relation in cases arising out of misrepresentations or deceits by persons standing in such re 19 159 Mo 596 61 S W 246 250 a2 127 N Y 143 27 N E 807 808 1 2 POMEROY EQUITY JURISPRUDENCE p 956 605VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW lation is explained by Judge Engerud in Beare v Wright 22 as follows To avoid any misapprehension from the use of the term fiduciary relation in speaking of the special circumstances under which a misrepresentation as to cost or value may constitute deceit we will say that we do not use that term in its technical sense We apply it to any situation where trust and confidence are reposed by one party in another under such circumstances as to impose on the person trusted the obligation to act in good faith The meaning given to the term fiduciary or fiduciary rela tion in those cases is so very broad and indefinite and the nature of those cases is so different from the subject under con sideration that the above definitions obviously cannot be consid ered as controlling the meaning to be given to the term fiduci ary capacity as used in Section 11k It is important to note however that the same idea seems to run through all those decisionsthat as explained in Smith v Ogilvie23 the word fiduciary implies trust and confidence and relates to the integrity and fidelity of the person trusted rather than his credit or ability and contemplates good faith rather than mere legal obligation STATUTES AUTHORIZING ARREST FOR FIDUCIARY DEBTS The term fiduciary capacity has been construed also in a number of New York cases which arose under a statute author izing the arrest of a factor agent broker or other person in an action for money received in a fiduciary capacity One of the leading cases of this class is Stoll v King24 In that case after explaining that the decision necessarily depended upon the construction to be given to the words fiduciary ca pacity Justice Harris said The term fiduciary as I understand it involves the idea of trust confidence It refers to the integritythe fidelity of the person trusted rather than his credit or ability It con templates good faith rather than legal obligation as the a2 14 N D 26

money he receives is not his own He holds it on a spe cial trust to pay it over to his principal Money received under such circumstances is received in a fiduciary capac ity The principal has confided in the man rather than his ability to pay If he abuses that confidence the law withholds from him the privileges it confers on other debt ors and declares that he shall be liable to arrest    After some further discussion the learned Justice prescribed the following criterion which he considered applicable in all cases of this kind    I think the criterion in every such case is to de termine whether the specific moneys received ought in good faith to have been kept and paid over to the employer or whether the defendant upon receiving such moneys had the right to use them as his own holding himself account able to his principal for the debt thus created In the lat ter case he would not be liable to arrestin the former he would This criterion was quoted with approval and made the basis for the decision in Decatur v Goodrich25 and is believed to have strongly influenced the court in a number of other cases In Goodrich v Dunbar 2 the defendant was consignee and general charge of the ship pay all expenses relating to her sell agent of a ship owned by the plaintiffs His duties were to take her and pay the expenses of the sale and then account to the plaintiffs as their debtor for the balance he might owe them after deducting all payments previously made by him and the balance due him from the plaintiffs on a former account The court held that the defendant was not liable to arrest under the New York law saying The Code allows the arrest of any person for money re ceived by any factor agent broker or other person in a fiduciary capacity Code Sec 179 The term in a fiduciary capacity tends to show what is meant by factor agent broker viz one in whom a trust is reposed such as is usually reposed in those persons in their ordinary or reg ular business that is a trust that they will sell and immedi 607 25 N Y 44 Hun 3 I N Y 17 Barb 644VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW ately account for the balance after deducting their commis sions not that they shall take a general charge of their principals business pay various debts of theirs and assume liabilities for them and then sell their property In Schudder z Shiells 27 it was held that a commission mer chant who receives butter to sell on a commission acts in a fi duciary capacity within the meaning of the New York statute and is liable to arrest on failure to pay over the net proceeds after the sale Justice Campbell quoted the above language of the opinion in Goodrich v Dunbar and then added the follow ing comment of his own     That is where a trust is reposed and not a credit givenwhere confidence is reposed in the integrity of the man rather than in his pecuniary ability In Obregon v De Mier 28 the defendant was held liable for arrest under the New York statute where a specific sum of money was intrusted to him to be invested in a particular way The court did not discuss the meaning of the phrase fiduciary capacity but took pains to point out that the plaintiffs did not repose any trust in the pecuniary responsibility of the defendant but did repose confidence in his personal integrity While the use of the term fiduciary capacity in the New York statute is much more similar to its use in Section 11k of the Federal Reserve Act than is the use of the term fiduciary relation in the equity cases discussed above yet the specific enumeration immediately preceding the phrase in the New York statutefactor agent brokeris so different from that in Sec tion 11ktrustee executor administrator etcand the sub jectmatter of the two statutes is so very different that it is be lieved that the actual decisions under the New York statute are of little ifany value as precedents in construing Section 11k It will be noted howeverand it is believed to be significant that in all the cases discussed above both the equity cases and those arising under the New York statute the courts seem to agree that the word fiduciary implies trust and confidence re posed in personal integrity rather than credit or financial re sponsibility 27 N Y 17 lHow Prac 420 421 2 N Y 52 How Prac 356 608NATIONAL BANKS AS TRANSFER AGENTS BANKRUPTCY CASES The term fiduciary capacity has been construed most fre quently in cases interpreting the Bankruptcy Acts It origi nally occurred in the first section of the Bankruptcy Act of 184129 which provided that upon compliance with the require ments of that Act all persons whatsoever residing in any state territory or district of the United States owing debts which shall not have been created in consequence of a defalcation as a public officer or as executor administrator guardian or trus tee or while acting in any othcr fidutciary capacity should be entitled to a discharge under the Act It will be noted at once that the language of the provision is strikingly similar to the language used in Section 1lk of the Federal Reserve Act which we are attempting to construe In view of that fact it would seem at first that the cases constru ing that provision of the Bankruptcy Act necessarily would con trol the construction to be given to the language of Section 1lk Upon a study of such cases however it is found that the decisions were influenced largely by considerations of ex pediency and by the necessity of construing the language so as to carry out the policy of the Bankruptcy Acts which is not at all similar to the policy of the Federal Reserve Act The leading case involving the construction of the term fi duciary capacity as used in the Bankruptcy Act of 1841 was Chapman v Forsyth30 In that case the Supreme Court of the United States held that a balance due from a mercantile factor to his principal arising out of the ordinary dealings between them was not a fiduciary debt within the meaning of that Act Justice McLean in delivering the opinion of the court said The second point is whether a factor who retains the money of his principal is a fiduciary debtor within the act If the act embrace such a debt it will be difficult to limit its application It must include all debts arising from agen cies and indeed all cases where the law implies an obliga tion from the trust reposed in the debtor Such a construc tion would have left but few debts on which the law could  Act of August 19 1841 5 Stat L 440 0O 2 How 202 609VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW operate In almost all the commercial transactions of the country confidence is reposed in the punctuality and integ rity of the debtor and a violation of these is in a com mercial sense a disregard of a trust But this is not the relation spoken of in the first section of the act The cases enumerated the defalcation of a public officer executor iadministrator guardian or trustee are not cases of implied but special trusts and the other fiduciary capacity mentioned must mean the same class of trusts The act speaks of technical trusts and not those which the law implies from the contract A factor is not therefore within the act This view is strengthened and indeed made conclusive by the provision of the fourth section which declares that no merchant banker factor broker underwriter or marine insurer shall be entitled to a discharge who has not kept proper books of accounts In answer to the second ques tion then we say that a factor who owes his principal money received on the sale of his goods is not a fiduciary debtor within the meaning of the act It will be noted that the learned Justice did not base his deci sion solely on the language of the Act but was strongly influ enced by the fact that If the act embrace such a debt it will be difficult to limit its application and that Such a construction would have left but few debts on which the law could operate His conclusion was influenced also by the fact that there was a provision in Section 4 of the Act which related specifically to brokers At this point it may be well to remark that it has been sug gested that if the term any other fiduciary capacity as used in the Federal Reserve Act were held to include transfer agents it would be difficult to limit its scope and it might be claimed that any ordinary mercantile agency comes within the act As will be shown however transfer agents unlike factors may be dis tinguished quite easily from the ordinary mercantile agents and act in a capacity which is very similar to one of those specifi cally enumerated in Section 11k Furthermore under the specific language of Section 11k a national bank may act in only such other fiduciary capacities as competing State banks and trust companies are permitted to act under the laws of the State in which the national bank is located 610NATIONAL BANKS AS TRANSFER AGENTS The Bankruptcy Act of 1867 31 varied in its language from that of 1841 It provided that no debt created by the fraud or embezzlement of the bankrupt or his defalcation as a public officer or while acting in any fiduciary character should be dis charged The enumeration of the specific capacities executor administrator guardian or trustee which preceded the words in any other fiduciary capacity in the Act of 1841 and which were considered to be of such significance by Justice McLean in Chapman v Forsyth were omitted Under this provision it was clear that trustees of technical special or express trusts such as executors administrators guardians etc were not relieved by a discharge from debts or obligations incurred by them while acting in such capacities32 A decided diversity of opinion resulted however as to the status of agents factors commission merchants etc One line of decisions treated the implied trust arising from such relation ships as fiduciary within the meaning of the Act on the ground that the Act of 1867 was conceived in terms so much broader and more general than the Act of 1841 that there was no chance to make any difference between special and implied trusts33 In the other line of cases the doctrine of Chapman v Forsyth was followed and the term was held to apply only to specific or express trusts and not to implied trusts34 The lat ter view is now conceded to be correct The corresponding provision35 of the present Bankruptcy Act 36 reads as follows A discharge in bankruptcy shall release a bankrupt from all of his provable debts except such as    were cre ated by his fraud embezzlement misappropriation or de falcation while acting as an officer or in any fiduciaryv ca pacity 31 Act of March 2 1867 14 Stat L 533 U S Rev Stat  5117  Laramore v McKinzie 60 Ga 532 Crisfield v State 55 Md 192 In re Maybin 16 Fed Cas 1221 Cromer v Cromer 29 Gratt 280 38

that trustees of express trusts admin istrators executors etc whose relations to their cestuis que tristent arise from express or special trusts act in fiduciary ca pacities within the meaning of this provision37 There has been quite a contest however as to whether the exception is limited in its application to that class of trustees or whether it includes also trusts implied from the relation of agents brokers factors etc to their principals It is now well settled that the term fiduciary capacity as used in the present Bankruptcy Act as well as when used in the Acts of 1841 and 1867 relates only to special technical or express trusts and not to those trusts which the law implies from the contract between the parties and which form an element in every mercantile agency and in a large proportion of all commercial transactions It is confined to technical trusts and the fiduciary character is not that which the debt gives rise to but must exist independently of it38 As intimated above it is believed that the strict construction given to the term fiduciary capacity as used in the Bankruptcy Act is entirely inapplicable to that term as used in the Federal Reserve Act While the Bankruptcy Act like Section 1lk of the Federal Reserve Act is a remedial provision yet the term fiduciary capacity as used in the Bankruptcy Act occurs in a provision limiting the operation of that Act so that a liberal in terpretation of the Bankruptcy Act as a whole requires a strict interpretation of the term fiduciary capacity In other words as intimated in the opinion of Chapman v Forsyth a liberal in terpretation of the term fiduciary capacity as used in the Bankruptcy Act would have greatly restricted the class of per sons eligible for discharge under that Act In Section 11k of the Federal Reserve Act the term fiduciary capacity oc curs in the main enabling clause which authorizes the Federal Reserve Board to confer additional powers on national banks for the purpose of enabling them to meet successfully the com 37 Ruff v Milner 92 Mo App 620 Stickney v Parmenter 74 Vt 58 52 Atl 73 38 In re Basch 97 Fed 761 American Agricultural Chem Co v Berry 110 Me 528 87 Atl 218 Inge v

612NATIONAL BANKS AS TRANSFER AGENTS petition of the State banks and trust companies and it is obvi ous that in order to construe that provision liberally it is nec essary to give the term fiduciary capacity a liberal rather than a strict construction It should be noted however that the special or technical trusts which are specifically enumerated in the Bankruptcy Act of 1841 as well as those which are held to be included in the term other fiduciary capacity as used in the various Bank ruptcy Acts are all fiduciary in the sense that trust and con fidence is reposed in the personal integrity or fidelity of the trus tee rather than in his mere financial responsibility RESULTS OF STUDY OF THE CASES A study of the many cases in which the terms fiduciary fiduciary character fiduciary relation and fiduciary ca pacity have been construed discloses therefore that in their narrowest sense as used in the Bankruptcy Acts they relate only to special technical or express trusts while in their broad est sense they are applicable to every relation in which trust and confidence is reposed in the integrity and fidelity of the person trusted rather than in his credit or ability Inasmuch as the strict and narrow construction given to the term fiduciary capacity as used in the Bankruptcy Acts was in duced largely by considerations of expediency and was neces sary in order to give a liberal construction to that Act as a whole the broader meaning given to the word fiduciary is believed to be its ordinary meaning This is indicated by the fact that it is the meaning given by the dictionary 39 to the adjective fi duciary 1 Holding held or founded in trust 2 Of the nature of a trust involving confidence or trust confidential as in a fiduciary capacity 3 Resting upon public confidence for value or currency said of fiat money and the like It is believed however that no definition of the term fiduci ary capacity could be framed which would be sufficiently com 3 WEBSTER NEW INTERNATIONAL 6136VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW prehensive to embrace all cases in which it might be used and yet sufficiently restrictive to be properly applicable to any par ticular case that might arise Indeed it appears that it is a rela tive or generic term the precise meaning of which in any par ticular case depends largely upon the connection in which it is used THE EJUSDEM GENERIS RULE In order to determine the precise meaning of the phrase any other fiduciary capacity as used in Section 1lk therefore it is necessary to consider carefully the other words with which that phrase is associatedwe must resort to the doctrine nos citur a sociis Referring to the text of the law it is noted that the phrase immediately follows a specific enumeration of certain capaci ties in which national banks may be authorized to act ie trus tee executor administrator registrar of stocks and bonds guardian of estates assignee receiver committee of estates of lunatics This at once suggests the familiar rule of statutory construction known as the ejusdem generis rulethat where general words follow an enumeration of persons or things by words of a particular and specific meaning such general words are not to be construed in their widest extent but are to be held as applying only to persons or things of the same general kind or class as those specifically mentioned40 Thus a statute which provided that any railroad company express company or other common carrier or any other person who in connection with the transportation etc of intoxicating liquor shall collect the purchase price or act as the agent of the buyer or seller shall be fined excludes banks ordinary collec tors and all persons who are not members of the general class of carriers41 And where a statute imposed a forfeiture for forbidden acts of the goods of any owner importer consignee agent or other person it was held that the words other per son did not include a stranger to the goods but was limited to some one of the same general class as those described by the 4 BLACK INTERP LAWS 2d ed p 203 4 First National Bank v United States 206 Fed 374 46 L R A N S 1139 614NATIONAL BANKS AS TRANSFER AGENTS words with which it is associated 42 Similarly it was held that a statute giving a right of action for wrongful death caused by the negligence or carelessness of the proprietor owner char terer or hirer of any railroad steamboat stagecoach or other vehicle for the conveyance of goods or passengers gave no right of action for wrongful death caused by the negligence of the driver of a wagon used for purely private purposes43 though it had been held that such statute gave a right of action for wrongful death resulting from negligence in the operation of a passenger elevator44 The particular words are presumed to describe certain spe cies and the general words to be used for the purpose of includ ing other species of the same genus The rule is based on the obvious reason that if the legislature had intended the general words to be used in their unrestricted sense they would have made no mention of the particular classes The words other or any other following an enumeration of particular classes are therefore to be read as other such like and to include only others of Jike kind or character 45 Applying the doctrine of ejusdem generis to the case in hand it would seem that national banks can act in only such other fi duciary capacities as are of the same general kind or class as trustees executors administrators registrars of stocks and bonds guardians of estates assignees receivers and commit tees of estates of lunatics 42 United States v 11502 Pounds of Celluloid 82 Fed 627 3 Pulom v Jacob Dold lPacking Co 182 Fed 356 359 4 Farmers  Mechanics Nat Bank v

follows When an author makes use first of terms each evidently confined and limited to a particular class of a known species of things and then after such specific enumeration subjoins a term of very ex tensive signification this term however general and comprehensive in its possible import yet when thus used embraces only things ejusdem generisthat is of the same kind or specieswith those comprehended by the preceding limited and confined terms Ex p Leland 1 iNott and McC S C 460 462 Pulom v Jacob Dold Packing Co 182 Fed 356 359 615VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW APPLICATION OF ABOVE CONCLUSIONS Applying to the term fiduciary capacity its ordinary mean ing as limited by a consideration under the ejusdemn generis rule of the words with which it is associated it would seem nec essary to reach the conclusion that in order for any particular capacity to be a fiduciary capacity within the meaning of Sec tion 1lk of the Federal Reserve Act 1 It must be a capacity in which trust and confidence is re posed in the integrity or fidelity of the person occupying it rather than in his credit or financial responsibility and 2 It must be of the same general kind or class as the ca pacities which are specifically enumerated in Section 1lk In order to determine whether the capacity of transfer agent meets these requirements it will be necessary to examine a lit tle more closely into the nature and functions of transfer agents And inasmuch as the capacity of registrar of stocks and bonds which is one of the enumerated capacities is very similar to and very closely connected with the capacity of transfer agent it will be convenient to consider it at the same time REGISTRARS AND TRANSFER AGENTS As explained above a transfer agent acts for a corporation in the matter of making transfers of the ownership of stock of the corporation from one holder to another This involves pass ing upon the regularity and legality of the assignments of title noting the transaction upon the books of the corporation can celing the old certificates and issuing new certificates in their places46 A registrar of stocks and bonds registers or records the issue of certificates of stock after they have been issued by the transfer agent and his function is to prevent an overissue of stock47 In practice the transfer agent makes the transfer and issues the new certificates The new certificate the old canceled cer tificate and any separate proof of the right to transfer are then sent to the registrar The registrar records the transfer by M HERRICK TRUST COMPANIES p 346 47 Id p 358 616NATIONAL BANKS AS TRANSFER AGENTS crediting the total authorized issue with the amount of the stock canceled and debiting securities issued and outstanding with the amount of the stock issued The registrar then signs the new certificate which completes its execution48 It is obvious that transfer agents are very similar to and very closely associated with registrars49 Indeed the two capacities are so very similar that they are often confused with each other Can it be imagined that Congress intended to authorize national banks to act as registrars of stocks and bonds but to withhold from them the right to act in the intimately related and exceed ingly similar capacity of transfer agent REGISTRARS AND TRANSFER AGENTS AS FIDUCIARIES The system of having separate registrars of stocks independ ent of the issuing corporation resulted from a fraudulent over issue of stock by a railroad president who was also transfer agent of the corporation50 To guard against such frauds in the future the New York Stock Exchange in 1869 adopted a rule requiring all active stocks listed on the Exchange to be regis tered by an agency approved by it5 The function of a regis trar therefore is to operate as a check upon any error or irreg ularity on the part of the transfer agent or the officer of the cor poration issuing stock and to see that not more than the author ized amount of stock is issued52 In other words when it was found unsafe to trust to the integrity of an officer of a corpora tion issuing stock the investing public demanded a disinterested S4 SEARS TRUST ICOMPANY LAW p 134 49 This is further indicated by the language of many of the statutes which authorize State corporations to act in such capacities Thus Section 185 of the Nev York Banking Law Consolidated Laws Chap 2 Laws of 1914 Chap 369 authorize trust companies To act as the fiscal agent of the United States or of any state municipality body politic or corporation and in such capacity to receive and disburse money to transfer register and countersign certificates of stock bonds or other evidences of indebtedness And Section 710158 of the Ohio Banking Code approved April 11 1919 provides that A trust company may act as agent or trustee for the purpose of reg istering countersigning or transferring the certificates of stock bonds or other evidences of indebtedness of a corporation association municipality state or public authority 60 The socalled Schuyler Frauds disclosed in 1863 b1 HERRICK TRUST COMPANIES p 358 62 Id p 143 617VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW third person to afford a check upon the other officers issuing the stock and to meet this demand the office of registrar was cre ated In view of this fact it would seem clear that trust and confidence is imposed in the integrity of the registrar as a dis interested third party and not in his financial responsibility especially since the corporation issuing the stock itself is very often sufficiently responsible financially53 Likewise one of the chief purposes in appointing independent transfer agents is to furnish an additional safeguard to prevent an overissue or a fraudulent duplication of stock or any falsi fication of evidence as to the truth of a certificate of a share of stock or registered bond which may fall into the hands of an innocent purchaser for value54 This being so it would seem that trust and confidence is reposed in the integrity of the trans fer agent as well as in that of the registrar and not merely in his financial responsibility Indeed a greater measure of trust and confidence is reposed in the skill and integrity of the transfer agent than in that of the registrar While the registrar only has to keep account of the total amount of stock outstanding and usually keeps his own private accounts and records for that purpose the transfer agent has to possess and exercise a very high degree of skill in passing upon the regularity and legality of assignments of title to shares of stock and is necessarily intrusted with the stock books the seal of the issuing corporation and a supply of blank stock cer tificates Both the investing public and the issuing corporation must rely upon the skill and integrity of the transfer agent in passing upon assignments of title It is clear that the trans fer agent has very important rights and powers which he is bound to exercise for the benefit of others and all the circum stances clearly impose upon him the obligation to act in the ut most good faith In view of these considerations it would seem that there can 3 It has been held by the courts

permitting overissues of stockin the absence of fraud or gross negligencehas never been finally settled and is a mooted ques tion See HERRICK TRUST COMPANIES pp 348 359 and authorities cited 5 See SEARS TRUST COMPANY LAW p 129 618NATIONAL BANKS AS TRANSFER AGENTS be no doubt that a transfer agent acts in a fiduciary capacity within the ordinary meaning of that term SAMt GENERAL KIND OR CLASS Having found that transfer agents clearly act in a fiduciary capacity within the ordinary meaning of that term it only re mains to determine whether the capacity of transfer agent is of the same general kind or class as the capacities specifically enu merated in Section 11k What is the general kind or class of capacities or functions which Congress had in mind when it amended Section 11k so as to authorize the Federal Reserve Board to grant to na tional banks the right to act as trustee executor administra tor registrar of stocks and bonds guardian of estates assignee receiver committee of estates of lunatics or in any other fi duciary capacity in which competing State banks and trust companies are permitted to act Remembering the language of the Bankruptcy Act of 1841 which withheld from the operation of a discharge in bankruptcy debts created in consequence of a defalcation as a public offi cer or as executor adnministrator guardian or trustee or while acting in any other fiduciary capacity and the now settled rule that the phrase any other fiduciary capacity as used in that Act relates only to the technical or special trusts it might be argued that the phrase or any other fiduciary capacity as used in Section 11k of the Federal Reserve Act likewise relates only to technical or special trusts were it not for the fact that the provision in which that term occurred in the Bankruptcy Act had to be strictly construed while section 11k of the Fed eral Reserve Act must be liberally construed in order to carry out the purpose of Congress Furthermore the specific enumeration in Section 1lk in cludes registrars of stocks and bonds which are not special or technical trustees since no estate interest or power in or affect ing property is vested in them for the benefit of others Inas much as the capacities specifically enumerated in Section 11k therefore do not all relate to technical or special trusts the 619VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW phrase or in any other fiduciary capacity cannot be limited to that class The most obvious point of similarity between all the enumer ated capacities is found in the fact that they are capacities in which trust companies have been acting for yearsie they are all well recognized trust company functions And that this is the general kind or class of capacities or functions which Con gress had in mind is verified by the fact that the very purpose of Congress in enacting the law was to enable national banks to meet the competition of trust companies by exercising those functions which gave trust companies such an advantage over national banks in competing for banking business Congress was not seeking to remedy a situation which existed in any one particular State but a condition which existed gen erally over the country and in nearly every State of the Union Congress therefore did not have in mind the powers which were enjoyed by trust companies in any one particular State but such powers as trust companies in general commonly ex ercise55 It cannot be disputed that the capacity of transfer agent is similar to all the enumerated capacities in that it is a capacity in which trust companies commonly act since the laws of most of the States expressly authorize State trust companies to act as transfer agents56 Furthermore the learned judge who ren 55 The purpose of Congress in imposing the additional limitation that national banks could exercise only such other fiduciary powers as com peting State corporations are permitted to exercise under the laws of the State in which the national bank is located was to avoid offending the public policy of any State by permitting national banks within its borders to exercise any fiduciary power which it would be in contraven tion of State or local law for any corporation to exercise 5 Colorado Act April 12 1915 Sec 1 Connecticut Public Acts 1913 Ch 194 See 8 as amended Laws of Florida Ch 6155 Sec 3 Revised Code of Idaho Sec 5224 Bank Laws

v Schuylkill Bank 7 demonstrated that as early as 1846 it was customary for banks to act as transfer agents CONCLUSION To recapitulate Under a general permit issued by the Fed eral Reserve Board under section 11k of the Federal Reserve Act a national bank may act in any particular capacity which is not specifically mentioned in Section 1lk only if 1 It is a capacity which is fiduciary in the sense that trust and confidence is reposed in the integrity or fidelity of the person occupying it rather than in his mere credit or financial responsibility and 2 It is of the same general kind or class as the capacities specifically enumerated in Section 1 ki e a generally recognized trust company function and 3 It is a capacity in which competing State corporations are permitted to act in the particular State in which the na tional bank is located These requirements are believed to be sufficient to elimi nate the objection that if the capacity of transfer agent is held to be a fiduciary capacity within the meaning of Section 11 k it will be difficult to limit the application of the term and that it will be necessary to construe it to include all the ordinary mercantile agencies such as factor broker insurance agent etc as well as such capacities as surety guarantor and insurer Even if the former class of capacities are fiduciary they are not of the same general kind or class as the capacities specifi cally enumerated in Section 11k The latter clearly are not fiduciary since dependence is placed only in the credit or fi nancial responsibility of sureties guarantors and insurers It has been demonstrated that the capacity of transfer agent is fiduciary within the ordinary meaning of that term and in the sense only that all the capacities specifically mentioned in the Act are fiduciary and it is of the same general kind or class Dakota Revised Code 1919 Sec 9047 Texas Banking Law Ch 2 Sec 16 Vt Laws Sec 5347 Virginia Code Sec 4148 Washington Banking  Tr Co Laws Sec

J100403,VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW,1064309,RIGHT OF NATIONAL BANKS TO ACT AS TRANSFER AGENTS,I243814,VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW RIGHT OF NATIONAL BANKS TO ACT AS TRANS FER AGENTS A DESIRE ON THE PART OF CORPORATIONS TO FACILITATE TRANS FERS OF SHARES OF THEIR STOCKS AT MARKETS DISTANT FROM THEIR HOME OFFICES AND TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AGAINST FRAUDULENT OVERISSUES OF THEIR STOCKS ERRONEOUS DUPLICATIONS OF OUTSTAND ING CERTIFICATES AND UNWARRANTED TRANSFERS OF SHARES OF STOCK HAS RESULTED IN THE VERY GENERAL CUSTOM OF APPOINTING TRUST COM PANIES AND BANKS AS TRANSFER AGENTS A TRANSFER AGENT ACTS FOR A CORPORATION IN THE MATTER OF MAKING TRANSFERS OF THE OWNER SHIP OFSTOCK OF THE CORPORATION FROM ONE HOLDER TO ANOTHER THIS INVOLVES PASSING UPON THE LEGALITY AND REGULARITY OF THE AS SIGNMENTS OF TITLE NOTING THE TRANSACTIONS UPON THE BOOKS OF THE CORPORATION CANCELING THE OLD CERTIFICATES AND ISSUING NEW CER TIFICATES IN THEIR PLACES THE FACT THAT COMPETING STATE CORPO RATIONS VERY GENERALLY EXERCISE THIS IMPORTANT FUNCTION HAS LED TO A DESIRE ON THE PART OF MANY NATIONAL BANKS TO DO THE SAME AND FOR SOME TIME IT HAS BEEN A MOOTED QUESTION WHETHER NA TIONAL BANKS MAY ACT AS TRANSFER AGENTS NATIONAL BANKS DERIVE THEIR POWERS FROM TWO MAIN SOURCES THE NATIONAL BANK ACT 2 AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE ACT3 THE NATIONAL BANK ACT 4 AUTHORIZES EACH NATIONAL BANK TO EXERCISE BY ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS OR DULY AUTHORIZED OF FICERS OR AGENTS SUBJECT TO LAW ALL SUCH INCIDENTAL POWERS AS SHALL BE NECESSARY TO CARRY ON THE BUSINESS OF BANKING BY DISCOUNTING AND NEGOTIATING PROMISSORY NOTES DRAFTS BILLS OF EXCHANGE AND OTHER EVIDENCES OF DEBT BY RECEIV ING DEPOSITS BY BUYING AND SELLING EXCHANGE COIN AND BULLION BY LOANING MONEY ON PERSONAL SECURITY AND BY IN PUBLISHING THIS

5136 594NATIONAL BANKS AS TRANSFER AGENTS OBTAINING ISSUING AND CIRCULATING NOTES ACCORDING TO THE PROVISIONS OF THIS TITLE IT HAS BEEN HELD THAT UNDER THIS PROVISION A NATIONAL BANK CAN EXERCISE ONLY THE POWERS EXPRESSLY GRANTED AND THOSE NECESSARILY INCIDENTAL5 THE PROVISION OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE ACT WHICH IS PERTINENT TO THIS DISCUSSION IS SECTION 11 K WHICH BROADENED THE POW ERS OF NATIONAL BANKS BY PERMITTING THEM UNDER CERTAIN CONDI TIONS TO EXERCISE CERTAIN SOCALLED TRUST COMPANY POWERS AND THUS TO MEET THE COMPETITION OF STATE CORPORATIONS WHICH TRANS ACT A TRUST COMPANY BUSINESS IN ADDITION TO A REGULAR BANKING BUSINESS IMPLIED POWER IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT NATIONAL BANKS MAY ACT AS TRANSFER AGENTS WITHOUT ANY SPECIFIC STATUTORY AUTHORITY ON THE GROUND THAT TO DO SO IS INCIDENTAL TO THEIR BANKING BUSINESS IN AN EARLY PENNSYLVANIA CASE DECIDED IN 18466 IT WAS HELD THAT BANKS ALTHOUGH NOT SPECIFICALLY AUTHORIZED TO DO SO HAVE IMPLIED POWER TO ACT AS TRANSFER AGENTS ON THE GROUND THAT SUCH POWER IS WITHIN THE NECESSARY IMPLICATION OF ALL BANK CHAR TERS SINCE LONG AND UNQUESTIONED USAGE AND CUSTOM PROVE THAT IT IS A NECESSARY OR USUAL FUNCTION IN THE TRANSACTION OF A BANK ING BUSINESS IN A SUIT BY THE BANK OF KENTUCKY AGAINST THE SCHUYLKILL BANK TO RECOVER FOR FRAUDULENT ISSUES OF STOCK BY THE RESPONDENT WHILE ACTING AS TRANSFER AGENT OF THE COMPLAINANT THE RESPOND ENT SOUGHT TO REPUDIATE THE CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT AS TRANSFER AGENT ON THE GROUND THAT IT WAS ULTRA VIRES THE COURT OVERRULED THE CONTENTION AND HELD THAT THE RESPONDENT HAD IMPLIED POWER TO ACT AS TRANSFER AGENT IN THE COURSE OF A LONG AND LEARNED OPINION THE PRESIDENT OF THE COURT SAID THE COUNSEL OF THE DEFENDANTS CLAIMING TO REPRESENT THE COR PORATION REPUDIATE SUCH A CONTRACT AS A THING PERTAINING TO NONE OF THE PROPER FACILITIES OF A BANK AND AS DISCREPANT WITH THE SPIRIT OF ITS CHARTER WHICH INTERDICTS THE CORPORA 5 LOGAN COUNTY NATIONAL BANK V TOWNSEND 139 U S 67 6 BANK OF KENTUCKY Z SCHUYLKILL BANK 1 PARS EQ CAS PA 180 595VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW TION FROM BUYING OR SELLING MERCHANDISE OR STOCK IT IS COMPARED TO A GENERAL MERCANTILE AGENCY WHICH THE BANK CONFESSEDLY COULD NOT LAWFULLY EXECUTE    WHAT IS A TRANSFER AGENCY IT IS A VERY HARMLESS THING IT AMOUNTS TO NOTHING MORE THAN THE WITNESSING OF THE CON VEYANCE BY ONE PERSON TO ANOTHER OF PERSONAL PROPERTY VIZ STOCK OF AN INCORPORATED COMPANY AND IN THIS CASE ALSO TO FURNISHING THE PURCHASER A CERTIFICATE OF OWNERSHIP OF SUCH STOCK ON THE SURRENDER OF A PREVIOUS CERTIFICATE OF LIKE CHAR ACTER HELD BY THE SELLER THIS IS VERY SIMPLE BUSINESS IN VOLVING LITTLE OR NO RISK OR HAZARD REQUIRING NOTHING BUT ORDINARY CARE AND FIDELITY IN ITS PERFORMANCE IF THE NECES SITIES OF ONE BANK REQUIRE ITS STOCK TO BE TRANSFERABLE IN AN OTHER PLACE WHETHER IN THE STATE OF ITS CREATION OR OUT OF IT WHY CANNOT IT ASK AID OF A CORRESPONDENT BANK THAT DOES ALL ITS OTHER BUSINESS IN SUCH A PLACE AND WHY CANNOT SUCH CORRESPONDENT BANK AFFORD THE AID REQUIRED IN THE CHAR TER OF THE SCHUYLKILL BANK THERE IS FOUND NOTHING IN TERMS FORBIDDING THE EXECUTION OF SUCH A FRIENDLY OFFICE EITHER TO ANOTHER BANK OF OUR OWN OR OF A SISTER STATE FOR LET IT BE REMEMBERED THAT IF IT IS UNLAWFUL FOR A BANK TO ACT AS TRANS FER AGENT FOR ANOTHER IT IS IMMATERIAL WHETHER THAT OTHER IS A BANK OF OUR OWN OR OF ANOTHER STATE IT IS THE WANT OF CONGRUITY WITH BANKING FUNCTIONS THAT MUST MAKE SUCH A CONTRACT ILLEGAL NOT THE LOCALITY OF THE CORPORATION FOR WHICH THE BUSINESS IS DONE IF NOT EXPRESSLY FORBIDDEN ANY IMPLIED INTERDICTION MUST SPRING FROM NOT BEING A CON TRACT NECESSARY OR USUAL IN THE COURSE OF BANKING BUSINESS TO THIS EXTENT THE IMPLIED POWER OF MAKING CONTRACTS RESI DENT IN ALL CORPORATIONS GOES ANGELL  AMES 200    SO FAR AS RESPECTS THE CORPORATION OF THE SCHUYLKILL BANK THE MATERIAL QUESTION IS WHETHER A CONTRACT ENTERED INTO BY HER DIRECTORY AGREEING TO ACCEPT SUCH AN AGENCY FOR AN OTHER BANK WAS AN USUAL AND ACCUSTOMED CONTRACT AMONG BANKS THAT MAINTAIN GENERAL BUSINESS RELATIONS WITH EACH OTHER SUCH USAGES SPRING OUT OF NECESSITIES AND ARE THE BEST EVIDENCE OF THEM AS THE CUSTOMS AND USAGES OF TRADE ARE PART AND PARCEL OF EVERY MERCANTILE CONTRACT SO A COURSE OF UNIFORM USAGE IN FAVOR OF A PARTICULAR COURSE OF BUSI NESS PREVAILING AMONG ALL BANKS FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC KNOWN TO EVERY BUSINESS MAN NEVER CALLED IN QUESTION BY GOVERNMENT NEVER REPUDIATED BY STOCKHOLDERS IS STRINGENT EVIDENCE OF SUCH A COURSE OF BUSINESS BEING WITHIN THE NEC ESSARY IMPLICATIONS OF ALL BANK CHARTERS    596NATIONAL BANKS AS TRANSFER AGENTS AFTER REVIEWING TESTIMONY SHOWING THAT BANKS IN PHILADEL PHIA AND NEW YORK COMMONLY ACTED AS TRANSFER AGENTS FOR OTHER BANKS WITHOUT THEIR POWER TO DO SO EVER BEING QUESTIONED THE LEARNED JUDGE CONTINUED    AT THIS TIME THE PHILADELPHIA BANK IS ACTING AS TRANSFER AGENT OF THE DEBT OF THE UNITED STATES WITHOUT WE PRESUME ANY IDEA BEING ENTERTAINED BY THE BANK DIREC TORS THAT THEY HAVE FORFEITED THEIR CHARTER BY THE ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH AN AGENCY OR BY THE GOVERNMENT THAT THE CORPORATE FUNDS OF THE INSTITUTION ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY FRAUD OR NEGLECT IN THE EXECUTION OF THE TRUST   IN THIS CONNECTION THE FACT MAY BE REFERRED TO THAT THE ORIGINAL AND LATE BANK OF THE UNITED STATES ACTED AS A COMMISSIONER OF LOANS FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND THAT THE BANK OF PENNSYLVANIA IS BY LAW THE TRANSFER AGENT OF THE STATE STOCK THESE DUTIES WERE INDEED IMPOSED ON THESE INSTITUTIONS AS CHARTER DUTIES BY GOVERNMENT BUT THIS MANIFESTS THE GENERAL IMPRESSION OF THE CONGRUITY OF SUCH FUNCTIONS WITH BANK OPERATIONS IN THE FACE OF AN USAGE SO BROAD AND GENERAL PREVAILING ALIKE AT HOME AND ABROAD IT WOULD BE A HARSH RULE THAT WOULD NOW DECLARE SUCH CON TRACTS VOID AND THE CHARTERS OF THESE BANKS FORFEIT WHICH HAVE ENTERED INTO THEM IN GOOD FAITH RESTING ON THE UNI VERSALITY OF SUCH CONTRACTS AMONG BANKS AND THE GENERAL ACQUIESCENCE OF GOVERNMENT IN THIS REGULARITY    IN A CASE SO CIRCUMSTANCED IF THE COURT DOUBTED THIS QUES TION WHICH THEY DO NOT THEY WOULD FOLLOW THE PRUDENT PRE CEDENT OF CHANCELLOR KENT IN THE SILVER LAKE V NORTH AND LEAVE THE GOVERNMENT TO DETERMINE WHETHER A FORFEI TURE SHOULD BE EXECUTED RATHER THAN IN A COLLATERAL WAY DE CIDE A QUESTION OF MISUSE BY SETTING ASIDE A JUST AND BONA FIDE CONTRACT       WE HAVE THUS PROGRESSED IN THIS INVESTIGATION UNTIL WE HAVE ASCERTAINED THAT THE CONTRACT FOR THE CREATION OF THE PHILADELPHIA AGENCY OF THE BANK OF KENTUCKY WAS IF IN FACT ENTERED INTO A PERFECTLY LAWFUL CONTRACT IN BOTH CONTRACTING PARTIES INCONSISTENT WITH NO LAW OF EITHER STATE AND PERFECTLY WITHIN THE LEGITIMATE SCOPE OF AUTHOR ITY POSSESSED BY THE DIRECTORS OF BOTH BANKS    WHILETHE BANK INVOLVED IN THAT CASE WAS NOT A NATIONAL BANK AND THEREFORE THE CASE MIGHT NOT BE CONSIDERED SUFFICIENT AU THORITY TO JUSTIFY THE CONCLUSION THAT THE POWER TO ACT AS TRANS 597VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW FER AGENT IS A POWER WHICH IS NECESSARILY INCIDENTAL TO THE POW ERS SPECIFICALLY CONFERRED UPON NATIONAL BANKS BY THE NATIONAL BANK ACT YET THE CASE WOULD SEEM AT LEAST SUFFICIENT TO JUSTIFY THE CONCLUSION THAT ACTING AS TRANSFER AGENT IS A FUNCTION WHICH HAS BEEN COMMONLY PERFORMED BY BANKS FOR MANY YEARS AND THE PERFORMANCE OF WHICH IS NOT AT ALL INCONGRUOUS WITH THE ORDINARY BUSINESS OF BANKING EXPRESS POWER UNDER THEI EDERAL RESERVE ACT AS WILL BE DEMONSTRATED HOWEVER IT IS ONE OF THE FUNCTIONS OF TRANSFER AGENTS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARDS WITH REFER ENCE TO THE TRANSFER OF STOCKS AND TO RENDER MORE CERTAIN THE DE TERMINATION OF WHO HAS TITLE TO SHARES OF STOCK SO TRANSFERRED IN VIEW OF THIS FACT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE RIGHT OF A CORPORA TION SELECTED AS TRANSFER AGENT TO ACT IN THAT CAPACITY SHOULD NOT BE OPEN TO QUESTION AND IT IS VERY DESIRABLE THAT IT SHOULD HAVE EXPRESS POWER TO DO SO WITHOUT DECIDING WHETHER NATIONAL BANKS HAVE IMPLIED POWER TO ACT AS TRANSFER AGENTS THEREFORE IT IS DESIRABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY MAY ACQUIRE THE POWER TO ACT IN THAT CAPACITY UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 11 K OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE ACT HISTORY AND PURPOSE BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO CONSTRUE THAT PROVISION IT IS BELIEVED AD VISABLE TO REVIEW VERY BRIEFLY ITS HISTORY AND GENERAL PURPOSE7 WHEN CONGRESS WAS CONSIDERING THE ENACTMENT OF THE FED ERAL RESERVE ACT IT FOUND IT TO BE VERY DESIRABLE IF NOT NECESSARY IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THE PURPOSES OF THE ACT TO PERMIT STATE BANKS AND TRUST COMPANIES TO BECOME MEMBERS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM SUCH INSTITUTIONS HOWEVER POSSESSED SO MUCH BROADER POWERS THAN NATIONAL BANKS THAT THEY ALREADY ENJOYED GREAT ADVANTAGES OVER NATIONAL BANKS AND IT WAS FEARED THAT IF THEY WERE AFFORDED THE ADDED ADVANTAGES AND PRESTIGE OF MEM BERSHIP IN THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM NATIONAL BANKS WOULD NO LONGER BE ABLE TO EXIST IN COMPETITION WITH SUCH STATE INSTITU TIONS THIS WAS FULLY DISCUSSED BY THE WRITER IN AN ARTICLE ENTITLED FIDUCIARY POWERS OF NATIONAL BANKS 6 VA LAW REV 301 598NATIONAL BANKS AS TRANSFER AGENTS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ADVANTAGES OVER NATIONAL BANKS WHICH STATE BANKS AND TRUST COMPANIES ENJOYED WAS THE POWER TO TRANSACT A TRUST BUSINESS IN ADDITION TO THE ORDINARY BANKING BUSINESS NOT ONLY WAS THE TRUST BUSINESS ITSELF VERY PROFITABLE BUT THEIR BROADER POWERS AND COMPLETE FACILITIES TO HANDLE A GREAT VARIETY OF FINANCIAL BUSINESS ATTRACTED TO THEM MANY CUS TOMERS THEY ALSO OBTAINED THE BANKING BUSINESS OF MANY PER SONS WITH WHOM THEY CAME INTO CONTACT IN ADMINISTERING TRUSTS MANY OF THE STATES HAD ALREADY FOUND IT NECESSARY TO PERMIT STATE BANKS TO EXERCISE TRUST POWERS IN ORDER TO MEET THE COM PETITION OF TRUST COMPANIES AND FOR SOME TIME IT HAD BEEN REC OGNIZED THAT NATIONAL BANKS WERE AT A DISTINCT DISADVANTAGE IN NOT HAVING BEEN GRANTED THE SAME PRIVILEGE IN ORDER TO COMPENSATE NATIONAL BANKS THEREFORE FOR THE AD VANTAGES GAINED BY STATE BANKS AND TRUST COMPANIES ON BEING ADMITTED TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM AND IN ORDER TO ENABLE NATIONAL BANKS TO CONTINUE TO EXIST IN COMPETITION WITH SUCH STATE INSTITUTIONS CONGRESS DECIDED TO DO UNTO NATIONAL BANKS AS SOME OF THE STATES HAD ALREADY DONE AS TO STATE BANKS AND TO PERMIT THEM TO EXERCISE SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT FIDUCIARY POWERS COMMONLY EXERCISED BY TRUST COMPANIES IN CARRYING OUT THIS PURPOSE CONGRESS AUTHORIZED THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD 8 TO GRANT BY SPECIAL PERMIT TO NATIONAL BANKS APPLYING THERE FOR WHEN NOT IN CONTRAVENTION OF STATE OR LOCAL LAW THE RIGHT TO ACT AS TRUSTEE EXECUTOR ADMINISTRATOR OR REGISTRAR OF STOCKS AND BONDS UNDER SUCH RULES AND REGULATIONS AS THE SAID BOARD MAY PRESCRIBE WHEN THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THAT PROVISION WAS QUESTIONED THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES UPHELD IT ON THE GROUND THAT CONGRESS COULD CONFER SUCH POWERS UPON NATIONAL BANKS IN ORDER TO ENABLE THEM TO CONTINUE TO EXIST IN COMPETITION WITH STATE TRUST COMPANIES AND STATE BANKS EXERCISING TRUST POWERS9 THE COURT FURTHER EXPRESSED THE OPINION THAT THE STATES COULD NOT CONFER TRUST POWERS UPON CORPORATIONS WHICH COMPETE WITH NATIONAL BANKS AND AT THE SAME TIME DENY THE RIGHT OF CONGRESS 8 SEC 11 K OF THE ORIGINAL FEDERAL RESERVE ACT O BANK V FELLOWS 244 U S 416 599600 VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW TO ENABLE NATIONAL BANKS TO MEET THAT COMPETITION BY EXERCISING THE SAME POWERS IN PURSUANCE OF THIS IDEA CONGRESS AMENDED SECTION 11 K SO AS TO ENABLE NATIONAL BANKS TO ACT NOT ONLY IN THE CAPACITIES ABOVE MENTIONED BUT ALSO AS GUARDIANS OF ESTATES ASSIGNEES RECEIVERS COMMITTEES OF ESTATES OF LUNATICS AND IN ANY OTHER FIDUCIARY CAPACITY IN WHICH COMPETING STATE CORPORA TIONS ARE PERMITTED TO ACT UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE IN WHICH THE PARTICULAR NATIONAL BANK IS LOCATED10 CONGRESS FURTHER AMENDED THE ACT SO AS TO AUTHORIZE THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD TO PERMIT NATIONAL BANKS TO ACT IN THESE FIDUCIARY CAPACITIES WHERE COMPETING STATE CORPORATIONS ARE PERMITTED TO DO SO EVEN THOUGH THE STATE LAW EXPRESSLY FORBIDS NATIONAL BANKS TO ACT IN SUCH CAPACITIES IN VIEW OF THESE FACTS AND IN VIEW OF THE GENERAL LANGUAGE OF THE ACT AS AMENDED IT IS CLEAR THAT IT WAS THE PURPOSE OF CON GRESS IN ENACTING SECTION 11 K AND IN SO AMENDING IT TO PUT NATIONAL BANKS UPON AN EQUALITY WITH COMPETING STATE CORPORA TIONS SO FAR AS THE EXERCISE OF FIDUCIARY POWERS IS CONCERNED THAT SUCH WAS THE PURPOSE IS FURTHER SHOWN BY THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT BY REPRESENTATIVE PHELAN WHO INTRODUCED THE BILL TO AMEND SECTION 11 K11 WE HAVE ENDEAVORED BY THIS AMENDMENT TO MAKE PROVISION WHEREBY NATIONAL BANKS SHALL BE PUT UPON PRECISELY THE SAME FOOTING WITH REFERENCE TO THESE FIDUCIARY POWERS SO FAR AS THAT CAN BE DONE BY OUR LAW WITH STATE BANKS TRUST CONM PANIES AND OTHER COMPETING CORPORATIONS THE ACT AS AMENDED THEREFORE IS CLEARLY A REMEDIAL PROVI SION ENACTED FOR THE PURPOSE OF BROADENING THE POWERS OF NA TIONAL BANKS SO AS TO ENABLE THEM SUCCESSFULLY TO MEET THE COM PETITION OF STATE BANKS AND TRUST COMPANIES AND IT SHOULD BE CONSTRUED LIBERALLY IN ORDER TO EFFECT THAT PURPOSE COMPETING STATE CORPORATIONS ARE COMMONLY AUTHORIZED TO ACT AS TRANSFER AGENTS AND THROUGH THE EXERCISE OF THIS PRIVILEGE

TRANSFER AGENTS AND IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE ACT SHOULD BE HELD TO AUTHOR IZE THEM TO ACT IN THAT CAPACITY IF ITS LANGUAGE IS REASONABLY SUS CEPTIBLE TO THAT CONSTRUCTION CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION 11K OBVIOUSLY THE BOARD HAD NO POWER UNDER SECTION 1LK AS ORIGINALLY ENACTED TO AUTHORIZE A NATIONAL BANK TO ACT AS TRANSFER AGENT SINCE THAT PROVISION CONFERRED UPON THE BOARD POWER TO AUTHORIZE NATIONAL BANKS TO ACT ONLY IN FOUR SPECIFIC CAPACITIES AS TRUSTEE EXECUTOR ADMINISTRATOR AND REGISTRAR OF STOCKS AND BONDS AND TRANSFER AGENT WAS NOT ONE OF THOSE FOUR CAPACI TIES EXPRESSIO UNIUS EST EXCLUSIO ALTERIUS THE BOARD THEREFORE RULED THAT IT HAD NO POWER UNDER THE ACT IN ITS ORIG INAL FORM TO AUTHORIZE NATIONAL BANKS TO ACT AS TRANSFER AGENTS12 SECTION 11K OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE ACT AS AMENDED BY

WHETHER THE SPECIFIC MONEYS RECEIVED OUGHT IN GOOD FAITH TO HAVE BEEN KEPT AND PAID OVER TO THE EMPLOYER OR WHETHER THE DEFENDANT UPON RECEIVING SUCH MONEYS HAD THE RIGHT TO USE THEM AS HIS OWN HOLDING HIMSELF ACCOUNT ABLE TO HIS PRINCIPAL FOR THE DEBT THUS CREATED IN THE LAT TER CASE HE WOULD NOT BE LIABLE TO ARRESTIN THE FORMER HE WOULD THIS CRITERION WAS QUOTED WITH APPROVAL AND MADE THE

STRIKINGLY SIMILAR TO THE LANGUAGE USED IN SECTION 1LK OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE ACT WHICH WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO CONSTRUE IN VIEW OF THAT FACT IT WOULD SEEM AT FIRST THAT THE CASES CONSTRU ING THAT PROVISION OF THE BANKRUPTCY ACT NECESSARILY WOULD CON TROL THE CONSTRUCTION TO BE GIVEN TO THE LANGUAGE OF SECTION 1LK UPON A STUDY OF SUCH CASES HOWEVER IT IS FOUND THAT THE DECISIONS WERE INFLUENCED LARGELY BY CONSIDERATIONS OF EX PEDIENCY AND BY THE NECESSITY OF CONSTRUING THE LANGUAGE SO AS TO CARRY OUT THE POLICY OF THE BANKRUPTCY ACTS WHICH IS NOT AT ALL SIMILAR TO THE POLICY OF THE FEDERAL

MADE CONCLUSIVE BY THE PROVISION OF THE FOURTH SECTION WHICH DECLARES THAT NO MERCHANT BANKER FACTOR BROKER UNDERWRITER OR MARINE INSURER SHALL BE ENTITLED TO A DISCHARGE WHO HAS NOT KEPT PROPER BOOKS OF ACCOUNTS IN ANSWER TO THE SECOND QUES TION THEN WE SAY THAT A FACTOR WHO OWES HIS PRINCIPAL MONEY RECEIVED ON THE SALE OF HIS GOODS IS NOT A FIDUCIARY DEBTOR WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE ACT IT WILL

LIMIT ITS APPLICATION AND THAT SUCH A CONSTRUCTION WOULD HAVE LEFT BUT FEW DEBTS ON WHICH THE LAW COULD OPERATE HIS CONCLUSION WAS INFLUENCED ALSO BY THE FACT THAT THERE WAS A PROVISION IN SECTION 4 OF THE ACT WHICH RELATED SPECIFICALLY TO BROKERS AT THIS POINT IT MAY BE WELL TO REMARK THAT IT HAS BEEN SUG GESTED THAT IF THE TERM ANY OTHER FIDUCIARY CAPACITY AS USED IN THE FEDERAL RESERVE ACT

INTERESTED THIRD PARTY AND NOT IN HIS FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ESPECIALLY SINCE THE CORPORATION ISSUING THE STOCK ITSELF IS VERY OFTEN SUFFICIENTLY RESPONSIBLE FINANCIALLY53 LIKEWISE ONE OF THE CHIEF PURPOSES IN APPOINTING INDEPENDENT TRANSFER AGENTS IS TO FURNISH AN ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARD TO PREVENT AN OVERISSUE OR A FRAUDULENT DUPLICATION OF STOCK OR ANY FALSI FICATION OF EVIDENCE AS TO THE TRUTH

INTEGRITY OF THE TRANSFER AGENT THAN IN THAT OF THE REGISTRAR WHILE THE REGISTRAR ONLY HAS TO KEEP ACCOUNT OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF STOCK OUTSTANDING AND USUALLY KEEPS HIS OWN PRIVATE ACCOUNTS AND

FIDUCIARY CAPACITY CANNOT BE LIMITED TO THAT CLASS THE MOST OBVIOUS POINT OF SIMILARITY BETWEEN ALL THE ENUMER ATED CAPACITIES IS FOUND IN THE FACT THAT THEY ARE CAPACITIES IN WHICH TRUST COMPANIES HAVE BEEN ACTING FOR YEARSIE THEY ARE ALL WELL RECOGNIZED TRUST COMPANY FUNCTIONS AND THAT THIS IS THE GENERAL KIND OR CLASS OF CAPACITIES OR FUNCTIONS WHICH CON GRESS HAD IN MIND IS VERIFIED BY THE FACT THAT THE VERY PURPOSE OF CONGRESS IN ENACTING THE LAW WAS TO ENABLE NATIONAL BANKS TO MEET THE COMPETITION OF TRUST COMPANIES BY EXERCISING THOSE FUNCTIONS WHICH GAVE TRUST COMPANIES SUCH AN ADVANTAGE OVER NATIONAL BANKS IN COMPETING FOR BANKING BUSINESS CONGRESS WAS NOT SEEKING TO REMEDY A SITUATION WHICH EXISTED IN ANY ONE PARTICULAR STATE BUT A CONDITION WHICH EXISTED GEN ERALLY OVER THE COUNTRY AND IN NEARLY EVERY STATE OF THE UNION CONGRESS THEREFORE DID NOT HAVE IN MIND THE POWERS WHICH WERE ENJOYED BY TRUST COMPANIES IN ANY ONE PARTICULAR STATE BUT SUCH POWERS AS TRUST COMPANIES IN GENERAL COMMONLY EX ERCISE55 IT CANNOT BE DISPUTED THAT THE CAPACITY OF TRANSFER AGENT IS SIMILAR TO ALL THE ENUMERATED CAPACITIES IN THAT IT IS A CAPACITY IN WHICH TRUST COMPANIES COMMONLY ACT SINCE THE LAWS OF MOST OF THE STATES EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZE STATE TRUST COMPANIES TO ACT AS TRANSFER AGENTS56 FURTHERMORE THE LEARNED JUDGE WHO REN 55 THE PURPOSE OF CONGRESS IN IMPOSING THE ADDITIONAL LIMITATION THAT NATIONAL BANKS COULD EXERCISE ONLY SUCH OTHER FIDUCIARY POWERS AS COM PETING STATE CORPORATIONS ARE PERMITTED TO EXERCISE UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE IN WHICH THE NATIONAL

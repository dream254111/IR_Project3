j100602,The Journal of the Royal Geographical Society of London,1797975,Address to the Royal Geographical Society of London,i303881, xxXv  A D D R E S S T0 THE ROYAL GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON Delivered at the Annzversary Meeting on the 23rd May 1842 BY WTTXTTS 1 RICHARD HAMILTON ESQ FRS C PRESIDENT GEN TLE MEN DURING the two years which have elapsed since I had the honour of addressing you from this chair the Science of Physical Geography has made large and rapid strides but is still very far from the goal to which we all look Immense tracts of land in enery quarter of the globe sorne even surrounded by populous and comparatively well knolvn districts still only deserve to be described as terra incognital to the geographer the historian and the traveller But still the sciellce which we profess to cultivate and which we are proud to say we have cultivated not without success for the last ten or twelve years has advanced is advancing and promises to advance in an increasing ratio The commercial adventurer prompted by views of interest the travel ler in pursuit of knowledge the politician seeking to combine his projects vf ambition with the welfare well or ill understood of his own country the pioneer by land or by water who precedes and the warrior who follows for conquest or for loss for fame or for defeat all equally conspire to aid our views all imperceptibly addto our stores and whilst as in other worldly matters each individual each mass of indivi duals each body corporate is struggling for its own narrow purposes by the happy dispensation of Providence the uhole is brought sooner or laterinto one focuswhich howeser large and comprehensive in its details will in its turn form but one unit in the further progress the human kind is perhaps destined to make towards universal science c 2S2XV1 Mr HAMILTON s Anniversary Addfess I have said that large portions of the surface of our globe are still terrcz incognite to us We must not be surprised at this I speak of regions far distant from European civilization but if we look nearer home close even to our own doors we shall find that we are still very far from our boasted accuracy that maps which half a century ago were thought or at least were designated as nearly perfect are now proved to be utterly fullacious and in many instances require to be recomposed What thenw can we expect beyond approximate certainty for the uncivilized portions of the earth  The seeds however are sown the soil is kindly whatever the willds that blow and from whatever quarter the storm threatens we are sure of an abundant harvest if we do not sleep over our work we lack no reapers to bring home the produce be it ours to house it well and to do our best in order to spread it amongst those who come to receive what we can distribute and above all to take care that we separate the wheat from the chaff and that we give only sound and wholesome nourishmellt to our guests I have said that war trade and the spirit of discovery are our princi pal allies in these pursuits But as they will generally act together and support each the other so will they at times thwart and counteract one another Sometimes as formerly in America SQ now in China and the East they go hand in hand and throw back the limits of geographical knowledge At other times too great ardour in the pursuit of it and a want of prudence in displaying too openly its results will by exciting jealousies and leading to acts of violence and outrageS annihilate in one moment the labours of months But I Inust not take up your time in abstract generalizations we deal in matters of fact and to them we must return iand in compliance with former practice our first attentions are due to the honoured dead OBITUA RY The early and violent death of one of our most distinguished mem bers Sir Alexander Burnes who fell a victim by assassination in the outbreak at Caboul early in November last has occupied so many fears and has been a subject of such universal regret that I should not be justiSed ixl dwelling upon this event longer than it may be necessury to add the expressions of sorrow felt for the loss by The Royal Geo graphical Society a body which was amongst the first to stamp upon Burness career in the pursuit of science the most solid mark of approbatioll in their power to bestow It is now eight years since this ralued and lamented officer received the royal premium in these rooms from the hands of the present MasterGeneral of the OrdnanceObituary   XXXVll then your president This proof of your admiration for his talents and of your confidence in what those talents were further capable of bringing about was bestowed for the ardour zeal ability and judgment evinced by Sir Alexander Burnes in conducting the first European expeditiors which had ever encountered the stream of the Indus from its mouth to its souTce and also for the exemplification of the same high qualities during his journey from the banks of the Indus through Caboul across the Hindu Koosh by Balk and the Transoxiana to Bokhara and into Persia luring a life of unremitted activity and most valuable services to the East India Company Sir Alexander Burnes was a second time employed to ascencl the Indus on this occasion the river was more accurately surveyed by Lieutenant Wood and a work which may be said to be a posthumous publication has recently appeared which has added very materially to our knowledge of the countries adjacent to that river and which will add to the fame of an officer whom all his countrymen in the east and the west hal hoped would long have been spared to us for the completion of still more important labours Captain Bird AllenX RN was one of the victims of the late un fortunate expedition up the Niger when he had the command of the Soudan He was also a member of our Society and the last volume of our Journal contains a sketch of the eastern coast of Central America compiled by this oEcer from the notes of Captain N Owen and the officers of the  Thunder  and  Lark The survey was pro secuted from Cape Catoche the N E point of Yucatan 21 31 N lat in a southerly direction for 37 miles along the eastern shore oi that pe ninsula including the shores of Spanish Yucatan and the British settle ment of Honduras thell in an easterly direction 350 miles to Cape Gracias a lios comprising part of the coast of Guatemala and Mos quitia and lastly again to the south for 2S0 miles to the Colorado river in lat 1047N long 83 37 W being the remainder of tbe coast of Mosquitia3 and fortyfive miles of the coast of Nicaragua The most remarkable geographical feature of this coast Captain Bird Allen observes is the chain of coral reefs and small islets at an avcrage distance of 15 miles from the mainland of Belise with a clear navigat ing passage within them from four to eight miles wide within this natural breakwater ships and boats navigate in all weathers by night and day Its sea boundary is a perpendicular coral wall of very great depth We have also to deplore the death of another member of the Society Captain William Cornwallis Symonls eldest son of Sir William Symonds Surveyor of the Navy and hilnself Deputv SurveyorGeneralXXXVii Mr HAMILTON Annirersary Jlddress of New Zealalld This meritorious young officer was unfortunately drowned in November last by the upsetting of a boat in which he was crossing the Bay of Avito on a duty of friendly benevolence An ac count of his first explorations in New Zealand has been read at one of our evening meetings and we were expecting a detailed memoir of his labours together with maps CaptaiII Symonds was zealous and irl defatigable in the pursuit of his duties and in his death which is a very great and immediate loss to the interest of a rising colony the Society are bereft of an ardent and able cooperator in the cause of geographical science Amongst the members whose loss the Society has suffered during the last year is Commander Michael Atwell Slater RN an officer who had earned for himself a distinguished reputation in the scientific brallch of his proSession His peculiar taste for hydrographical pursuits led him from the ordinary duties of the service illtimes of peace and in 1Ei16 five years after he entered the navy we find him assisting in the extensive and wellknown surveys of Captain W H Smyth in the Mediterranean After the conclusion of tllat vast work an ample field was offered to his esertions on the shores of his own country in conduct ing the survey of the eastern coast of England and Scotland To this service he was appointed by the Lords Commissioners of the Adrniralty previus to 1830 and he surveyed the coasts of Durham Northurnber land and Scotland from Hartlepool to Fort William with a degree of accuracy which coull not be surpassed His drawings are remarkable for their faithful detail and the neatness of their execution and so ell tirely was his whole mind devoted to the important duty with which he was intrusted that not only did he spare no personal exertion that could forward it but expended much of his own private resources on this laudable object It was in the midst of such useful labours that Commander Slater was cut off in the prime of life on the 2rld of February last by falling illtO the sea over the cliff called Holburn Head on the eastern extremity of Scotland Geography has likewise experienced a very severe loss in the Ull timely death of Dr Lord the companion of Burnes and of Wood who had done most valuable service in the course of their navigation up the Indus and who was killed at Parwan in the last action of our troops with Dost Mahommed on the 2nd of November 1840 Sir Alexander ii3urnes in his  Caboul gives two of Dr Lords letters from Khoondooz dated December 1837 which as he says cannot be read without deep interest and with a melancholy regret at the death of their ener getic and accomplished writer I shall hereafter have occasion to mention the circumstances underOlvituery XXX1X which the cause of geotraphy has lost one of its most ardent followers in the person of Dr Forbes who had just completed a tour of observation amongst the countries watered by the Helmund in the west of Afghanistan The late distinguished officer of the French marine and one of her most celebrated circumnavigators Admiral Dumont dUrville was one of the unfortunate victims of the railway accident which took place on the 8th inst at Meudon He was President of the Geogra phical Society of France Captain dUrville left France on his first voyage to the South Seas in 1826 and returned in 1829 having visited New Zealand New Holland New Guinea the Carolinas c His second voyage was commenced in September 18307 and he again returned to France in 1840 having reached 66 30 of south lat in long 138 21 During this voyage he discovered IJa Terre Adele and Clarie and he received the honorary distinction of the medal of the Geo graphical Society of Paris in 1841 I regret to have to announce to you the death of General Campana who by birth a Neapolitan was the Director of the Austrian Military Geographical Institute at Vienna where he died on the 8th of June lastyear General Campana was oIle of our foreign honorary mem bers it was by this distinguished geographer that the proposition was made to the Emperor of Austria to construct a chorographical map of all Italy on the scale of 3 lines to 1000 toises in consequence of which Austriall ellgineers have commenced their operations in the Papal states The Bombay Geographical Society one of our earliest affiliations have had to deplore the loss of Dr Heddle their late Secretary who fillex3 also the same office in the Horticultural Society of that presi dency this gentleman had made himself eminently useful in the organization and general proceedings of both these establishments and their members have come eagerly forward on the occasion to testify their conviction of the superior acquirements enlightened views and un wearied exertions which Dr Heddle had always estinced in guidin and cooperating with their endeavours to extend the boundaries of geo graphical knowledge and to call forth the agricultural and commercial resources of India As geographers we are bound more particularly to lament the loss of Dr Heddle who was always ready to give instructions to any one who expressed a wish to contribute papers on geographical sllbjects for the meetings of the Society Russia has lost lurinO this year Mr Boethling a aoung man of very promising talents who had made a geognostic tour into Russian Lapland Mr Sokolowsky author of an elementary treatise on Geography for the Military Schools 3 vols 8vo 183941 and Mr Bienimann author ofgl Mr HAMILTONS Snniversary Address a Geographical Notice orl the Governments of Esthonia Linronia and Courland PROGRESS OF GEOGRAPHY EnglandThe maritime surveys of the coasts and islands of Great Britain and of her foreign possessions are still carried on with the same zeM and talent which have erer characterized this department as well as every otherof our naval service The following are those which especially invite our notice 1 Captain BullockS of H M S Fearless having completed the survey of the river Thames from London Bridge to the Nore on such a scale that all future changes in the banks will be detected is now employed in the mouth of the river and is uniting his own work with the Survey of the North Sea 2 Captain Washington of H M S Shearwater whose energies and devotionto the cause of geography almost all who hear me have for several years witnessed and admired within these walls has been for the last year employed in carrying on the survey of the North Sea between the lat of 52 10 and the Dutch and Belgic coasts a large portion of which had been completel by the late Captain Hewitt and published by the Board of Admiralty In order to accelerate the completion of this great undertaking Captain Washington has the command of a steamvessel and arl accompanying tender both well adapted to the service 3 On the north coast of Scotland the more easterly parts of the sur vey had been nearly finished and the party had reached Thurso when on the death of Commander Slater the highly skilful and zealous con ductor of the survey Lieutenant Otter who had been some time under his orders was appointed to continue the service 4 The survey of the west of Scotland has already advanced north ward from the Solway Firth to the Firth of Clyde and it will probably be completed in the ensuing season 5 Mr George Thomas of H M S Masti is still engaged on the eurvey of the Shetland and Orkney Islands the shortness of the season and the severity of the weather in that climate make a veIy rapid ad vance quite impracticable 6 Commander Sherringham of H M S Sylviaa having last year finished a very minute chart on a large scale of Spithead is now ex tendinz his work to St Helens and the Owers 7 The Irish Challnel has long been very imperfectly explored A survey of this sea under the direction of Captain Beechey of H M S Lucifer and which has already made considerable progress will greatlyIrogrers of GeographyEngland xli increase the confidence of those by whom it is navigated and will ulti mately by the judicious use of its soundings enable the mariner to tra verse it with nearly equal security at night or in a fog as by day light 8 The east coast of Ireland from Donegal Bay to Dublin Bay surveyed by the late Commander Mudget has been published and Comnander Frazer is now proceeding southward towards Wexford after examining that dangerous series of rocks which almost denied access to this most vital part of Her Majestys dominioils 9 The survey of the ShanIlon having been completed from Limerick to Fergus Bay is now under the direction of Lieutenant Wolfe rapidly advancing towards the entrance of that river 10 Commanders Graves and Brock of H M ships Beacon and Mag pie have thoroughly examined the western shores of Asia Minor Deep and wide gulfs little visited since the days of Athenian supremacy or Roman conquest in those seas have been charted and numerous cities on those classic shores have been rescued from oblivion by their labours Captain Graves is now about to undertake the survey of the coasts of Crete and Cyprus when these are completed he will proceed to the shores of Syria and Palestine and if aIl opportunity offers he has been instructed to carry a set of chronometers to the temple of Jerusalem 11 The river St Lawrence from Montreal to the island of Anticosti and the northern shore of the gulf of that name through the strait of Belleisle have been surveyed by Captain Bavfield irl the hired vessel Gulnare This indefatigable officer has since been employed upon the southern shore of the gulf along the coast of New Brunswick and he is now surveying that of Prince Edwards Island 12 Commander Barnett and Mr Lawrence of H M ships Thllnder and Luck have been for some years engaged alternately according to the season alollg the coast of Mexico and amoIlg the Bahama islands The details of these last were till recently quite unknown and their lngitllde in some places erroneous by a whole degree I3he minute examination of the many dangerous shoals and bays and coral banks which are found in tnese seas has been followed by real benefit Commander Barnett will now press forward into the Gulf of Mexico he has already laid down some dangerous reefs off the coast of Campeche 13 Captain Belcher and Commander Hellett of H M ships Sulphur and Starling having laboured for four or five years on the west coast of America were returning home by China but being detained on the Chinese coast in consequence of the war their enterprising activity as seamen and their skill as pilots hase been of the utmost service during1   Xlll tIr H AMILTON S Anniversary SddSress the operations of EIer Majestys land and sea forces engaged in that part of the globe The Sulphur being nearly worn out in the service is zlow on her way home but the Starling is so useful an addition to the fleet on an imperfectly known coast that the Admiral has determined to retain her under his coinmand 14 Much of the hitherto unknowll northwest coast of Australia has been recently explored by Captain Wickhanz of H M S Beagle and since that able officer was obliged tv invalid and come home Lieutenant Stoke who was appoillted as acting Commander in his absence has dis covered some navigable rivers etnptying themselves into the Gulf of Carpentaria wehope sonn to receive further details of this very inte resting fact The survey in those seas will be continued hy Captain Blackwood and Mr Yule of H M ships F1v awnd BrambleX which have lately left our shores their main objects will be the examination of the great barrier reef which extends from 25 south lat to Torres Strait the survey of the passage through that strait and the estension of their researches along the south coast of New Guinea and the Louisiade 15 The Falkland Islands were partially examined by Captain FitzRoy in 194 and since in more detail by Leutenant Robinson of the Arrow but this officer having been obliged from ill health to relin quisll the survey the corltinuation of it has been made over to Com mander Sulivan of H M S Philomel 16 Captain Vidal havinb returned from the esamination of the ground llear the Azores where it nvas suspected that shoals might have been formed by the recent earthquake is now about to proceed to the survey of the central group of thoe islands Besides thcse important maritime surveys which during the last twelxre months have occupied much of the attention of the Hydrographic Office of the Admiraltf this active institution has engaved and published 105 charts of various parts of the globe exclusve offour of our own seas and inland waters Copies of all these works are deposited by the liberality of the Lords Cornmissioners of the Admiralty in the collection of maps and charts belonging to this Societnr where they are at all times open to the inspection of the melnbers and of all others who nuay wish to consult them Ordnrlce SurveysThe latest account we have of the progress of the great ordnance map of England is up to the 31st of March at that time all to the south of a line drawn east and west through Leeds had been published with the exceptiorl of three sheets then in the hands of the engravers The surveying is going on in Lancashire and Yclrkshire a part of which counties together with AVestmoreland CumProgress of Geography Russia xliii berland Durham and Northumberland were all that remailaed to com plete the survey of England The six northern counties of England together with Scotland will be on a scale of 6 inches to the mile Towns having a population exceeding 4000 souls are laid down on a scale of 5 feet for a mile Of the Irish surarey all the counties have been published except seven four of which are in the hands of the engraver Of 115 Irish cities and towns 74 have been surveyed on a scale of 5 feet to a nzile 22 upon smaller scales and 19 plans of towns have not yet beell received Of the large town maps of Ireland one sheet only has yet been published viz the Castle Sheet Dublin The Ordnance geoloical maps of Cornwall Devon and West Somer set are completed and an Sso TolumeX containin3 a report of the geological structure of the same district with a detailed account of its economic geology was published by order of the Lords Commissioners of Her Majestys Treasury Another 8vo volume describin its organic remains has also appeared under the same authority Tlle Ordnance geological survey of Great XBritain is nonv engaged on the district comprising South Wales Monmouthshire Herefordshire Glou cestershire and East Somerset The maps of these districts are in a forward state and when published will be accompanied by special reports The importance of the undertaking both in a scientific and economic point of view is too selfevident for me to dwell upon it and confided as it is to so experienced a geologist as Sir H T de la Beche we are justified in reposing a most perfect confidence on the veracity of its details RussiaIn 1828 the Russian government directed that a survey vf the coasts of the Baltic within its territories worthy of the advanced state of the science of geodesy should be undertaken Sinlilar operations had previous to that time been carried into efEect on their respective coasts by the governments of Sweden Prussia and Denmark It was resolved to begin by measurilag a chail of triangles along the Russiarl coast alld over the slands in the Gulf of Finland for the purpose of determining a number of points and then to fill up the outline by soundings and other nautical operations The observations were to be adjusted to the accu rate trigonometrical operatlons of Generals Schubert alld Tenner and to the meridian measurement of Struse wherever these reached the coast The trigonometrical and astronomical operations were begun in 1829 and completed in 1838 One basis was measured at Revel and another at Aland in Finland Upwards of 600 points were trigollome trically determined and for greater accuracy the elelratioll of the pole and azlmuths svere taken by observation at tell points Theodolites byxliv Mr HAMILTON s Snniversary ilddress Ertel were used in measrlring angles and a twelveinchuniversal instru ment by the same master was employed in the astronomical observa tions The triangulation is connected at one extremity across the Aland Haaf vith the trigonometrical measurement of Professor Gronstrandt in Sweden alld is linked to the operations of 13essel in Prussia through the medium of General Tenners measurement irl Courland The chrnome trical expedition of LieutenantGeneral Schubert in the Baltic in 1833 Journal of the Royal Geographical Society Vol VI p 413 was insti tuted with a view to contribute greater accuracy to these operatins These preliminary labours having been compIeted the detailed survey of the coast of Finlalld was commenced in 1833 Ron1vboats were employed to take the soundings within the reefs and 10 versts seawards and to ensure accuracy the surface of the sea was divided into squares having a verst to each side by means of flagbuofiJs the exact positions of which avere ascertained by trigonometrical observation Four or five brigs and schooners were placed at the disposal of Captain Reinecke 7ho commanded the expedition for the purpose of taking the sounlings at greater distances from the coast By these means the soundings were taken in summer with as much accuracy as has been attained at Cronstadt and Revel in winter by drawing lines on the ice and sinking the lead at intervals along them The survey of the Gulf of Finland from St Petersburg to Hongoudd is completed and the charts on a scale of 1 inch to 400 yarls are in the course of preparation some are already in the hands of the engraver Operations were commenced in the Gulf of Riga in the spring of 1840 The expedition to which this part of the task has been allotted is at present engaged upon the passage into the gulf between Swalferort and tile coast of Courland A steamboat has been placed at the disposal of Baron Wrangell who commands the expedition with a view to ensure greater accuracy in taking soundings at a distance from the coast and lofty signalposts have been erected on shore for the purpose of determin ing with precision at all times the position of the steamer As this coast affords no shelter from storms to ships or boats the nautical part of the operations is exposed to many kazards and difficulties which will call into esercise all the approved perseverance skill and zeal of the chief and of the officers under him Baron Wrangell is already knowr to the scientific world as Struves assistant in his meridian measurement Amollgst other hydrographical works in progress under the direction of the Imperial government an atlas of the coasts of the Black Sea is being engraved the materials have been collected during a series of years by Captain Marganard and other naval officers by directiorl of Admiral GreigP ogress og GeograyhyEussia xlv In the autumn of 1 S39 two Russian miners Kowolewsky and Gerngross were sent to Bokhara at the Khans request to search for usefulmineris in his territory On reaching the sea of Aral they were obliged to return to Orenburg on account of the relations then existing between Russia and Bokhara In the summer of 1841 the Russiarl government despatched a second mission at the head of which was placed Butenieff superintendent of mines He was accompanied by Bogolowsky who also held an appointment in the mining service and the naturalist Zehman According to the most recent intellitence Butenieff was still at Bokhara Bogolowsky and Zehman under the protection of the government of Bckhara had reached Samarcand and penetrated from that city into the Alpine country beyond On this excursion they have discovered veins of coal In the beginning of 1840 the Russian Government dispatched Dr Schrenk to the Altai to inquire into the natural history of that tract of country On his journey Dr Schrenk made several geognostic observa tions the most important of which relate to the islandhill Araltuabe in the lake Alakuli betmreen Semipalatinsk and Tchugutchak or Tarba gatai This hill has hitherto been assumed to be of volcanic origin and Asiatic travellers have even pretended to have seen flames proceed from its summit Schrenk however visited the island and found that it con sisted of granite and clayslate Thonschiefer The geognostic observations of lr Ruprecht in the peninsula of Kanin are interesting They pronte that the same formations which extend over a wide space in Northvest and Central Russia predominate there also Ruprecht brought from the Indega the TsheskajaGaba and some other localities petrifactions of the mountainlimestone Bergkalk and Jura limestone in good preservation In the peninsula of Kanin the moun tainlimestone is found in contact with rocks the collstituent parts of which are crystallille The measures adopted b the Academy of St Petersburg for insti tuting exact observations on the temperature of the frozen soil at dif ferent depths in the well at Jakutzls the details of which were coln municated in the JourrAal of the Royal Geographical Society Vol VIII p 401 were frustrated by the removal of Mr Schergin from that place and his subsequetlt death Tt has now been resolved to fit out an ex pedition for the express purpose of corlducting these observations and examining at the same time the natural history of the most northern district of Siberia the peninsula between the rivers Pjassida and Cha tanga This regioll has only once been visited by men of scientific acqliirements and that more than 100 years ago by rlaval officers under the Empress Anne of whose reports some extracts alonc have beenxlvi Mr HAMILTON s Arniversaqy Hddress published Since their time no one has visited ie Pjassida or Chatanga or even penetrated to the north of Turuchansk except the student Sujews sent by Pallas to navigate the Jenissei to the sea who turned back before he had fully accomplished hs mission The im portance of a journey in that imperictly known country had for Eome time engaged the attention of the Academy but it sras necessary to procure information from Turuchansk before any arrangements could be made The observations on the well at Jakutzk were postponed until this preliminarv information should be obtailled under an impression that it would be advisable to intrust the two investigations to the same expeditioll The result of the inquiries brwarded to Turuchansk which was re ceived in ffie eourse of last summer clearly showed that it is all but impossible for a numerous party to traverse the regions between the Chatanga and tjassida and penetrate to the seacoast in summer and ffiat even for a small party the difficulties are such as can only be over come by great capacity for the endurance of continuous toil both of mind and body It is evident that with these qualifications must be com birled extensive and staried information and a keen interest in the pro motion of sciences to ensure results of sufficient salue to repay the cost and labour of the expedition All these qualities the Imperial Academy has found ullited in Professor von MiddendorS of the lSniversity of Kiew ffie companion of Professor Baer on his journey to Lapland mrho Teadily undertook the expedition The plan presented by the Academy has received the sanction both of the Emperor and the ministers and although the professional engagements of MiddendorS have rendered some delay inevitable he is expected tQ be in St Petersburt in the course of the summer and hopes are entertained that he will be able to reach Turuchansk or Jakutzk before e end of nest winterr The objects of the expedition areI To collect information re specting the statistics ethnography and natural history of the country between e Ejassida and Chatanga to reach the coast at one point at least and to renlain there some time it the purpose of acquiring a knowledge of the matine productions at a central point on the shores of the Frozen Ocean Il To investigate the phenomena cxf the tem perature of the groundice penetrated by the well at Jakutzk to collect inbrmation from other districts respecting the eXtent thickness and formation of the groundice of Siberia to measure the degrees of warmth to which the soil above the groundice is raised in summer by the sunS and the wmer deposited from the atmosphere to determine the vege tation developed by means of this warmth to tzamine theW relations existing between springs and the groundice and in short to contributeProgress of GeographyRus3i  S 11 as much as he can to complete our knowledge of the groundice and throughout the journey to give instructions to competent persons how to make observations in districts which the traveller is unable to visit in person The iourney is expected to occllpy three years the details of the plan are left to be modified by Professor von MiddendorS as local circumstances shall render necessary He will sink a number of ther mometers at different depths in the side of lhe wells at the close of svinter during the summer he will either sail down the Lena or proceed to Ochotsk leaving behind him an instructed observer whose observatons he will check on his return Whether the excursion to Jakutzk or that to the Chatanga be the first ulldertaken will be decided in Siberia It would be out of place to notice here the ulterior objects of tbis expedition It ought however to be mentioned that a journey to the northern regions of Western Siberia will be commenced at the same time under the commanl of M Sjogen a member of the Academy the chief object of which is to collect ethnographical and philological information but which will not omit to procure intelligence respecting the groundice Both expeditions will make a point of directing the attention of intelligent persons to the most important questions bear ing upon the phenomenon of groundice with a view to procure information from them either during tlle course of the journey or at some later period Instructions how to make the necessary observa tions have been circulated already and will be more widely dispersed by the travellers In his widelyextended efforts to classify and bring into comparison with our wellknown deposits in this part of Europe the strata of European Rllssia Mr Murchison President Qf the Geological Society has by his own labours and those of his companaons Count Keyserling and M de Verneuil been able to contribute several data on the physical geography of that country which will serve to modify certain pre conceived views Count Keyserling has determined by barometrical observations the relative altitudes of naore than lO0 places in the interior of Russia in Europe varying fronl 150 to 1000 feet above the level of the Baltic A broad and comparatively elevated zone of an average height of about 600 feet with summits reaching to 900 and 1000 feet extends from Lisonia to Koursk and dies away to the SE bevond Voroneje It is the southern portion of this plateau lvhich lMr Murchison and his friends unexpectedly discovered to constitute a dome of very ancient stratified deposits separating Western Russia into two very distinct mineralogical north and south basIns The previous journey of Mr Murchison to the northern golTernmentsxlviii Mr HAMILTON iInntrersary Address Of Russia and to the White Sea had shown that the old yet prevalent idea of the Waldai hills between St Petersburg and Moscow being con nected by a line of high lands with the Ural Moulltains i e by the supposed Great Ourall of the learned Henry Muller is a baseless hapothesis for the higher grounds in Vologda c which never exceed 600 feet trend to the N E and not eastwards towards the Ural whilst the watershed between the N and S flowing streams united by the famous line of canal projected by Peter the Great is occupied by marshes and has in llO respect the character of a continuous ridge  Of the Ural Mountains in examining which Mr Murchison spent three months he will shortly communicate to the Society some remarks explanatory in great part of a beautiful map of the S Ural prepared for his use by General Perowski in pursuance of the orders of His Im perial Majesty This memoir and map accompanied by a dissertation by M Khanikoff will serve to explain many physical features of a tract which occupied by Bashkirs and containing little mineral wealth in comparison with N Ural has been less examined by competent geo graphers Baron Meyendorff brother to the author of the  Voyage to Bucharia has written a geographical memoir on European Russia which together with a nzap has been presented to the French Academy of Sciences Aleoutean Islands If the few natives of these distant islands seem at first sight to possess but little interest for us nevertheless as mem bers of the great human family whose history is now engaging so much attention the knowledge of their language superstitions and manners may throw considerable light upon the origin of tribes their communi cations their dispersions c Mr P Fohn VenaiminofE a Russo American who has spent ten years in the Fox Islands has published a grammar of the Aleoutean language and a description in Russian of the people some account of which will be found in the  Bulletin de la Socifdte de Geographie of Paris I have becn ansious to enter more at length into the details of these geographical expeditions to Russia because they relate to parts of the world amongst the least known to those who hear me because the objects to which they are directed are highly interesting to the physical geo grapher and because they reflect honour on the enlightened awnd spirited Gourernment by whom they are promoed M Beguly a learned Hun garian who has travelled through Lapland Finland and Esthland for the purpose of compaTing the Magyar language with the Finnish dia lects is at present at St

its physical geography as rigid geo graphers we still know comparatively little But at every step our tra vellers make in that favoured part of the ancient world they are sure to reap a rich harvest of topographical geographical and archeeological knowledge I must not be deterred on private considerations whilst enumerating those to whom we are most indebted for information of this llature from inviting your attention to the Travels sn Asia Minor by Mr W J Hamilton in the years 1836 and 1837 This traveller hdS brought home a large rnass of Greek inscriptions many of them indicative of anciellt sites In his way to Cars an Anni Oll the confines of Turkish Armenia and Georgia he visitel the silver mines of Guinesh Khalla On his return along the south coast of the Black Sea he identified some of the cities mentioned by Xenophon alld others the abode of the Chalybes east of the Thermodon the jurletion of the Iris and Lycus the rocksalt mines oll the confines of Pontus and

late been lled and maintained on tlle degree of depression of the Dead Sea below the level of the Med terranean but it is now placed beyond doubt having been aseertaiIlcd by the boiling of water by barometrical and by trigonometrical opera tions Messrs Moore and I3eek xsere the first to draw attention to the sllbject in the spring of 1837 theyconcludedfromthe temperattre at which lvater beilel that the Dead Sea was between 50 alld 600 feet beloxY the Mediterranean Professor Schubert of Munich in the same yeara anade the depression 598  5 feet bybarometricalmeasurement Mr Russiger an Austrian naturalist made it 1400 feet also by baro metrical measurement M Berthou states it from llis barometrical ob servations to be 1332 46 feet while calculations from the data furnished by the late Sir Dazid Wilkie make it 1200 feet It will be perceived that while all these statements confirtn the fact of a great depression they state its amount very diSerently Indeed as Dr Robinson very justly observes in his  Biblical Researches in Palestiole 4 the question could never be decided with exactness but by means of a line of trigo nometrical levels between the two seas Fortunately this has ow leen effected by Lieutenant Symonds of the Royal Engineers This oEcer during the course of last year carried a line of levels across from JafEs to tlle Dead Sea by two diXerent routes and the results correspondint to within an insignificant fraction give 1311t9 feet for the depressioIl of the iIead Sea belonv the leel of the Mediterranean being a very few feet less than that given by M Berthou Lieutenant Srmonds by the same operations found the level of the lake sof Tiberias to be only 328 feet belolv that of tlle Mediterranean making an inclination of nearly 1000 feet between this lake and the Dead Sea a distance of about 70 miles this latter tract has never been explored We may shortly expect to receive the further details of Lieutenawnt Sylnondss triangulations through this important tract of country In the mean time it may be interesting to the Society to learn that the district portioned out to Lieutenant Symonds had been the part of Syria south of Cape Bianco near Soor to Djezir Jashoob ia Saffet He was furnished with an excellent seveninch theodolite and after revisitlg with it the triangulation of the northern district which he had commenced with a fi tinch instrumentX he went south and measured a base from the Martyrs Tower near RalBleh on the plain vf Jaffa on which he foundedProgress of GeographyAsicz lsi hiB triangulation for the south portion of his district and finding the instrument sufficiently nicely divided in its vertical arc he was enalJled to ascertain the relative levels of his various points with great accuracy He then worked with his triangulation towards the head of the Dead Sea taking at every station a very accurate series of vertical angles the mean of which he worked on making the necessary allowances for refraction and curvatule but owing to the want of another instrumellt and a com petent person to take simultaneous observations he could llot ascertain what the former was and had to assume it at 7 of the subtended angle from the earths centre which he considers to be very near the truth Lieutenant Sf monds completed the levels in this manner by two differellt lines from JaSa to Nebi Samuel the highest point of the Jerusalem range the one checking the other and found the difference but trifling From thence he started on thesame plan to the Dead Sea and witl early as good success the two levels differing from 11 to 12 feet Owing to the unfavourable nature of the ground about tTerusalem anl the cliSs overhanging the plain of Jericho Lieutenant Symonds could not carry the two lines of level independently of each other to the required spot which might have been done ill spite of the natural diEculties had he had better assistance than he could procure from Bedouins The work occupied him nearly ten weeks though the distance traversed was not more than 47 miles the direct distance from JaSa to the Dend Sea though round by Nebi Samuel Jerusalem cit lvill be nearly 52 miles Ara1wia The Society has been favotlred by Baron Koller with an account of a new and but little known route from hIount Sinai to Akabah with a map As the paper has been read to the Society I need not here enter into its details A

on this as on all precedillg occasions The chief difilculties encountered were from the strengtll of the current caused by different parapet walls constructed in the river to raise the waters for the pllrpose of irrigation but which might be partially or uholly removed at certain places so as to make the navigation as well suited for commercial purposes as it is elsewhere Captain Lynch found the

to the value of Dr Robinsons Researches in Palestine We are also indebted to another enterprising and zealous American gentleman Dr Asahel Grant for some valuable information respecting that part of the mountains of Kurdistan which is inhabited by the Nestorian Christians In the course of his journey through this country from Mosul and the ruins of Nneveh to Ooroomiah west of the lake of that name Dr Grant sisited Akra and Amadieh Baineriza and Julamrk on the banks of the upper Zab and BashkaIa in the country of the Hakkary Dr Grants principal object in the course of this e2Qpedition having lbeen to visit the Nestorian Christtans scattered over the mountains of Kur distan and to ingratiate himself with the inhabitants by the practice of medicine amongst them he was unwilling to create jealousies lv paying too great attention to the physical geography of the country But in an ethnological point of view his book is highly aluable he describes the Yezidis between the fBumedias or Havri the Zab and Tigris rivers with a system of worship composed of Sabianism Judaism and Manicheism as kind alld hospitable to him as a Christian But Dr Grant chiefly dwells on the present and past state of the Nestorians and he has displayed considerable powers of historical and philological criticism in bringing together a variety of arguments to prove that they are the lineal and direct descendants of the Ten Tribes of the Captivity Tk points of resemblarlce which are most successfully brought fornvard are lst The locality being identical with that ill which we learn from the

indirectly we are sure to receive from them very important accessions to geographical antl ethnological science We arc much illdebted to the very learned Professor HX H Wilson allthor of  Ariana Antiqua containing a descriptive account of thc antiquities ansl coins of Afghanistan for a full and satisfactory mernoir on the successive fortunes and the comparative geography of the country lying betweell Persia Proper and the Indus It isfull inasmuch as it llaces in juxtapositioll the most authentic recent accounts of Afthanistan in its most estended sense both with the earliest Oriental authorities and with the data given to us by allcient writers and it is as scltivfactowy as can be expected under the twofold disadvantage of none of the writers of antiquity whose works are now extant having had any personal knoxvledge of the countrf and of the partial and imperfect manner in which modern travellers have as yet explored it This last source of information is still limited to a certain llllmber of routes more or less accurately laid down and we must I fear have to wnit many years before this very interesting portion of the Asiatic continent can be thoroughly investigated The same observations apply with still more force as all contemporary documents have perished to the latter portion of Prnfessor Wilsolls Ancient Notices of Ariana in which he has thrown much light on the line of Alexanders march from the Caspian Gates or the Gaduk Pass at the SE angle of the Caspian throu3h Hyrcania and larthiana to Meshed and through Asia Proper to Herat or Ale2ndria in Aris thence avoiding the Tugged and difficult cOuntry through Parapomisus or the hilly district of the Hazares southward to thc great lake of Zara in which the Helmund loses its waters along the banles of

of the Osus or at least one branch of the Oxus emptying itself into the Caspian Sea alld he is of opinion from a careful comparison of the authorities cited in Strabo and in Pliny with the most authentic recent accounts of the great desert between the Atrek river and the lake of Aral that in ancient times a southern branch of the Oxus was conveyed through this said district in a line south of Kwarizm into the aspian north of the gulf of Balkan and that thus credit may in great part be givell to the assertion of Strabo on the authority of Aristobulus that the Oxus was one of the great channels of communication for the purposes of trade and war for a large tportion of the rlute between the Indus and the Black Sea Seistan Major Rawlinson already so well known for his valuable contributions to our Journal has availel himself of his residence as political agent at Candahar to commission Dr F Forbes in the summer of 1841 to visit the province of Seistan the lake of Zurrah and the lower hasin of the Helmund river the Hermandus or Etymander of the ancients From the scanty information we have hitherto received of the result of the expedition it appears tllat Dr Frbes was apparently received and welcomed in the most friendly and hospitable manner by the several chiefs of the districts through which he passed but the too open and undisguised manner in which he collected information and in which he required from the inhabitants the most millute geographical and statistical details ultimately excited so strong a conviction of the sinister purposes for which they supposed he was visiting their country and this connected with the recent advances of the Indian almy into various districts of Beloochistan and Cabool that at the verv moment of recrossing the Seistan frontier he was barbarously murclered by lbrahim khan of Ichanabad and up to the presetlt period we have no accoullt of any of his memoranda or drawings having been rescued from the hands of his despoilers We are glad to learn however from Major Rawlilzson that the accumulation of materials of positive geography in the countries west of the Inlus was going OI1 steadily and satisfactorily

mouth of the Wiger consistillg of three steamvessels of light draught of water construeted for the pur pose and placed under the command of Captain Hexlry Trotter The main object of the expedition was to open a communication with the chiefs in that part of Africa with a view to the establishment of a friendly and commercial intercourse with the inhabitants which might lead to the extinctioll of the traflic in slaves Instructions were given to take the steamvessels up the Niger and its tributary streams as far as they should prove to be navigable anci afterwards to visit irl open boats or by land journeys the countries which could be conveniently reached and to send explorers in any direction which might be thought advisable Much was therefore naturally anticipated in the way of geographical discovery particularly in an easterly direction towards the sollrces of the Tschadda But the disastrous sickness which unhappily visited the expedition commenced when it had only been a feaN days in the Niger and arrested its progress before it had arrived as far as had previously been ascended by steamvessels under Lalider anl Becroft Egga about 340 miles from thc sea was the farthest point reached on the lKiger and there was no opportunity of reaching the Tschadda The banks of the river above tlle delta were proved to be less fertile than was expected A favourable spot however was found on the right bank immediately opposite to the confluence of the two rivers where a party of civilized blacks from Sierra Leone were landed under the superintendence of an experienced planter from the West Indies and a small farm establishment was erected at the expense of some gentlemen in London for the purposes of stimulating the natives to improvement in agriculture and of ascertaining the capabilities of the soil Should this little band of colonists who have been left here with a small vessel for tlieir protection have determined to remain and be able to maintainProgress of GeogrgAy Africa  Z1S their footing and keep up an intercourse with the coast we may hope that ere long the settlement will be a point from which the Tschadda may be fully traced and further discovery nlade Above the torn of EJDoe or Ibq or rather Abdh  which last is the proper name of the town as well as of the country in which it is situated the only diverging branch to the sea was a very small one 2 or 3 miles above that place said to lead to Bonny and believed to be only navigable by canoes The two principal branches to the sea may therefore be considered one by the Nunn falling into the Bight of Benin and the other soto the Bight of Benin near the town of Warra which latter branch was navigated as far as that place by Captain Becroft of the Ethiope The King mountains or rather hills through which the united streams of the Niger and Tschadda flow to the sea were estimated not to have an elevation of more than 1200 or 1500 feet above the river and they appeared to be in groups rather than to form a range chain It may be remarked that the Niger was not called Quorra or Kowarra between Egga and the sea the usual appellation beillg the native word for water according to the dialect of the place At Iddah the Niger was called the white water and the Tschadda the dark water in allusion probably to the muddy appearance of the one and the comparative clear ness of the other at particular seasons of the year The best chart map of the Quorra or Niger river is still that by Captain William Allen which has been published by the Admiralty This Captain Allen previously to accompanying the late expedition as Commander of the Wilberforce had been up the river with Lander in 18334 when he made a survey of the Quorra and Tchadda under very great disadvantages but which proved on this occasion to be very correct tYestern Coast Through the kindness Or Messrs Jatnieson of Liverpool we have received an account of Benin as described by Messrs MofEat and Smith it appears however to be neither extensive nor important Cottonwool is said to be itldigenous to Benin and is spun and wove into cloth by the women Sugarcane is also of good quality the soil is laid out in square plots producing yams plantairls cassada and Indian corn The country between Gatto and Benin is finely wooded and in some places is very beautiful Of greater ill terest is Captain Becrofts

is ruled by an independellt soveleignlxs Mr HAMI LTONS ilnniversary jl ddress was effected in 1840 have not lefore been made public Mr Becroft first ascended the Formosa a fine told river which divides into two branches each of which was traced up one for a distance of 50 nziles and the other 70 miles when farther progress was rendered impossible by the impenetrable nature of the aquatic vegetation From the clear ness of the water compared with that of the Niger before visited by Mr Becroft he judged them to be different rivers Foiled in the attempt to reach the NiOer by the Formosa Mr Becroft tried what is called the Warru branch and succeeded in reaching the Niger a little below Ebu From this point he ascended as high as New Bajibo in about 9 40 and within two hours of Lever to proceed was impossible on account of the strength of the current The ressels therefore returlled by the Warru Throughout the six months sojourn in the Niger the party was received in the most friendly manner by kings chiefs and people The country above the town Iddah some 200 miles from the coast is represented as very beauti ful the soil fertile and the climate agreeable the natives peaceable an3 desirous of commerce Cotton and indigo are indigenous pro ductions the latter well prepared and of good quality Mr Becroft was directed by his emplowTers to remain in Africa during the year 1841 in order to ascend and trade upon the Old Calabar and Cross rivers but the prosecution of his purpose was delayed till late in the season and it was just when on the point of commencing it that his most timely assist ance was required for and zealously afforded to H M S Albert in distress up the Niger and his sllecess in bringing this vessel to Fernando Po is well known He zevertheless asceilded the Old Calabar which he says is of no importance heyond the influence of the tides The Cross river was ascended as far as a town of considerable popula tion called Ommann distant about 70 miles in a N W by N course This town is otl an island and supplies the people of Old Calabar largely with oil and live stock I cannot quit the subject of this expedition to the Niger without mentioning the llame of Dr Stanger surgeon of H M S Albert who when the other officers were entirely disabled from sickness suc ceeded in navigating tlle Albert part of the way down the river with no other knowledge of steam machinery than what he acquired irl the urgency of the moment from the study of Tredgolcls work on the steam engine EgyptSir Gardner Wilkinson has availed himself of his recent return to a country which has already been so much illustrated by his geographical and antiquarian labours to make a minute and accurate survey of the valley of the Natron Lakes and of a part of the Bahr elPrOgreSS OS GeOYrtWAY XfrSC6t 1XX1 farg otherwise lsnown as the Bahr bela ma This wady runs towards E1 AIaghra or the wady SUIr1ar on the Siwall road on oIve side and to the back of the mountains at the western end of the lake MwerisX on the other and a brarlch also estends to the valley of the Nile a little below Abooroash six or seven miles north of the Pyramids of Gizeh Sir Gardner is decidedly of opinion that this wady has never been the bed of a river Tnuch less what some have called itS the old bed of the Wile It bears no alluvial deposit and it is interrupted by numerous projecting ridges Its sides abound like many other parts of the desert with petrified wood The wady oz valley of the Natron Lakes is 22 miles long its greatest breadth being 51 feet from the brow of the hill the bottom beirlg 2 miles broad In some of the lakes are springs of fresh water illfiltrated throllh the sands from the shore of tile Nile the process is very slow the water of the lakes not risint till three mallths after that of the river Not a11 the lakes produce natroll though muriate of soda or salt is foulld in all these substances are found at the bottom after the surface water has been evaporated the salt in a layer of about 18 inches thick and the natron about 27 inches Sir Gardner has also sent to the Society a mSlp of tllis district the result of observed latitudes by the measurernerst of a base and triangles AbyssiniaDr Beke in addition to information communicated by him on brmer occasions has sent home since our last anniversary several reports of his journeys and observations in Abyssinia which have been kindly made known to us by the gentlemen under whose avlsfiices Dr Beke has hitherto been travelling Of these the first is from Fiahr 14th January 1841 orl his route to Allkober The country round Tajurah as far as lake Assal is volcanic beyond which there are no traces of anf thitlg of the sort The greatest elevation he had observed was 1342 feet at Arabdera But the most remarkable fact stated by the traveller is the depression of Lake Assal lhich like the Dead Sea has its level X onsiderably below that of the ocean By the boiling of water this depression of the lake which is only about 20 miles from the sea was found to be 760 feet The next communication from the same traveller was dated Ankober 3rd March In this paper Dr BeVe gives the latitude of Angolalla and the relative situation and distance of seseral places He says that Messrs Combes and Tamisier had been at Shoa and nere consequently the first Euroean visitors since the time of the Portuguese Jesuits Mons Dufe a Frenchman came next he died at Jidda then Isemberg and Krapf Germalls thell Rochet dHericourt and finally himself being the first Englishman Mr Airton had diedlxxii Mr HAMILTON s Annilersclty Address as also Messrs Fain and Kielmaer lr Beke states Angolalla to be 8400 feet above the sea and Ankober 8200 The Chakka moun tains form the watershed between the Nile and the Hawash The Beresa is a tributary of the Hawash The vegetation about Allkober strongly reminded the traveller of England and he adds there is exTery variety of climate il the coulltry At Angolalla 29th May Dr Beke met with a native of Narea who gave him some valuable information relating to the existence there of a great river the Godjob which flows it is said into the Indian Ocean either by the river Quilimani in lat 3 S or by the river Tebee at Lamu or more likely by the Rio dos Fogos at Juba a little south of the equator Be this as it may the existence of a large river coming down to the coast in this part of Africa is an object of con siderable importance as forming a line of watercommunication with the interior which may ultimately be turned to good account It is represented as being three miles broad and navigated by large canoes each scooped out from a single tree and capable of containing 50 or 60 persons But the most valuable paper in a geographical point of view received from Dr Beke was dated Ankoler the 12th June In this communicatiotl Dr Beke details his route from Ankobers the capital of Shoa to Kok Fara in the province of Gedem never before visited by any Europeasl and thence back to Ankober by a more westerly route In the course of this excursion Dr Beke first crossed the numerous headwaters of the Hawash flowing eastward and on his return several streams running westward to the Abai He has thus determined that important point the position of the watershed between these two rivers which near Sebcha in 10 11 N is a swanlpy moor with low moun tain peaks on either side Dr Beke describes the country he traversed as varyin in character from the most absolute sterility to the most lusuriant vegetation He speaks of large plantations of capsicums and of excellent cotton of rich cornfields alld fertile meadows the whole studded with trees and divided by hedgerows of jasrxline roses and honeysuckle The rivers are subject to be suddenly swelled by rain so that what has just been forded becomes almost instantl aol impe tuous and devastating torrent It is greatly to be regretted that although Dr Beke took with him the necessary instruments for making observa tions the weather totally precluded his making any use of them He has however mapped his route by bearings and distances and ascer tained the heights of many points by the temperature of boiling water Tile last news from this zealous traveller is of the 24th August Iy which we are informed that he was pTeparing for an expedition toProgress of GeographyAfrica av xs ll the westward and even contemplated a journey across the continent to join the Niger expedition of the fate of which he was of course ignorant when he wrote He says he had found fron on his way to Gedem and had received aluminous slate from Bulga He supposes that coal will be found near it and hopes that Captain Harris will be able to ascertain the fact Coal he adds has not been found near Tajurah as had been asserted In speaking of Abyssinia we cannot omit to mention the mission of Captain Harris It left Tajurah on the 24th May and consisted besides Captain Harris well known for his adventtlres in Africa of Captain Graham Captain EIorton of H M 74th Regiment Lieutenant Barker I N Dr Wirk Dr Scott and Dr Inapey geologist and botanist and a draughtsman with a Elltopean guarl of honour From such

Featherstonhaugh and Mudge This document which was commu nicated to the legislature in the year 1840 accompanied with a detail of the observations on which it was compiled contains a large mass of information on the physical character of the highlancRs dividing tne waters of the St Lawrence from those of the Atlantic and as soon as the general physical features of the country which it describes

Bulletin of the French Geographical Society British GuclyanaMr Greenough in his last anniversary address in formed the Society that Mr Schomburgk had beell sent on a special mis sion to British Guayana and that he had safely reached Demerara on the 24th of Janllary of the last year It was also stated that Her MajestysProyasess of Geoy aplySouth Smereccr 1   J XN ll Goverlement in conseqllence of a reqvlest fronz the Council of the Society had permitted him to endeavour to discover the source of the Orinoco Since that time two memoirs from Mr Schomburgk the one on the mouths of the rivers Barima and Waini and the other on the ascent of the former of those and other rivers of British Guayalla have been commulaicated to us by the Secretary of State for the Colonial Depart ment With regard to the Waini Mr Schombvkrgk says that though free from shallows and sandbanks it is not qvlalified as a resort for large ves sels it may be navigated by those of small size there being at high water 12 or 14 feet over the bar and a greater depth in the channel It is a tidal river and fresh water procurable only at the distance that can be made by a boat with one tide ill its favour The Barima was entered by a natural channel of communication which joins this river with the Waini and here the Barima was 700 feet wide subject to tidal influ ence and its waters of a dark colour The party having gone otl to Gumaka its correct geographical position was determined and therlce they surveyed the river first downward to its mouth and subsequently higher up At its mouth the Barima has the same disadvantages as the Waini but when once entered there is anuninterrullted navigation for vessels of 250 or 300 tons up to the junction of the Aruka indeed says Mr Schomburgk a finer liver for steamers could not be desired the fish of both the Waini and Barima is abundant and valuable alld if fresh water could be procured for the fishingstations the fisheries of these rivers might become a useful branch of nternal commerce Mr Schomburgk describes the soil and vegetation of this region and the gigantic trees which serve the Warrans for their canoes and from the branches of which the aromatic varlilla hangs in large festoons perfum ing the air with its fragrance With regard to the Orinoco Mr Schomburgk is of opinion that the river Mocajahi is the only one by which the sources of that great river can be reached The part of British Guayana exalrsined by Mr Schomburgk is an intr cate wilderness of anastamosing streams whose direction hitherto most erroneously set dowll in our maps is now correctly ascertained while the resources of thc collntry have been well examined In Mr Schomburgks second report he started from Cumaka on the Aruka reentered the Barima which he ascended to its source and found it navigable for steamers of considerable size as high up as the first falls Having redescended the stream he quitted it at the settlement of Manari and going overland in a southerly direction reached the Baramaw at Cariacu running here in a direction nearly parallel with the Barimalxxviii Mr H A M I LTO N S Snniversary X ddress andultimately joining the Waini The Barama was ascended for four daJs and the character ofthis river itself and the veetation on it3 hanks are described 88 very similar to those of the Barima At no great distance from the source of the Barama the party quitted the river and following the valle of one of its tributaries the Aunama arrived at Haiowa on the Cuyuni descending which river and its dangerous cata racts WIr Schomburgk retllrned to George Town The result of this interesting expedition which occupied three months and a half is that notwithstanding the very unfavourable state of the weather twentyone points have been astronomically determined and a true knowledge has been gained of the course of therivers Waini Barima Amacura Barama and Cuyuni all of which never having been before visited by any competent traveller are very erroneously laid down upon our maps Gest CoastThat there have been great changes in the configllration of the earths surfce is well known and however slow and gradllal the nature of her operations Nature is still at work upon her task of modi fying the forms of our globe mountains incline their heads valleys raise their levels watercourses change their direction lakes become dry by desiccation or bv upheaving and while the sea recedes from the land in one place it encroaches in another A comparisoll of what is with what has been leaves no dollbt of these mutations but they are generally sensible only after a long lapse of years In some cases however the changes are more rapid and we have an instarlce of this in a note communicated by General Millar on the rise of the western coast of South America  There was he says c at Valdivia in 1820 only 2 feet water where 60 or 70 years previous sis Dutch line ofbattle ships had anchored The rivers Bir Bir asld Imperial are

Captain George Grey now Goverllor of South Australia has given to the world a journal of two expeditions in Western Australia Australia SouthEast cornerThe exploration of Count Streletsky is well knosn to the Society and it will be remembered that in speaking of the several rivers rhich he crossed the Count described them as fall ing directly into the sea This was however merely cojectural fromProgress of GeografphyAust czlia lxxix the direction of their courses wllere he crossed thern and from the gene ral direction of the slopes of the country Mle have however since received the copy of a report from Mr John Orr to Governor La Trobe by which it appears that the course of the La Trbe river is not southwest as laid down by Cotlnt Streletskv but is due east and in its progress it receives the rivers Macorlochie Barney and Dunlop which rivers were at first supposed to empty themselves directly into the sea The La Trobe increased by these tributaries falls into a large lake described as beillg 20 miles long from east to s est and 6 miles broad and which also receives the Perry This lake was named Wellington Australia SouthThe importance of the Murray river to the colo

22 tons and drawing 6 feet water has been warped into the sea mouth of this river Australia the Interior Ollr curiosity respecting the interior of this great islarld still remains unsatisfied but our knowledge of the seabord is constantly increasing It will be remembered that after the enterpris ing Mr Eyre had found hi3 intended progress northward from the head of Spencers Gulf intercepted by that extraordinary geographical feature of the country the great Horseshoe Lake Torrens he directed his steps towards Streaky Bay in the hope of finditlg to the west of the lake the means of resuming his original clirection Mr Eyre left Fowlers Bay on the 25th February accompanied by an overseer and three native bos and proviled with horses and provisions for nine weeks and reched King Georges

in the flats and valleys and abundarlce of water There was howevere no timber but the tl atree Fronz the Salt Lagoon the country crossed onTer was very bar ren About 16 miles northeast from Cape Reche the travellers fell ill with a considerable saltwater river from the WNW which appeared to join the sea at a gap left by Flintlers in the coastline On the banks of this river were some Casuarina3 teatrees Eucalypti and a little grass Inlanl from where the river was crossed the country seemed to improve and good runs for sheep and cattle might perhaps be found in that direction Farther westward

made of fresh Bater being taken up from the side by the prahhs in the Gulf of Carpentaria at a con siderable distance from the shore This would naturally induce the supposition that a large body of fresh water rwust flow into the gulf and in eXect we have recently received an account from Acting Cmmander Stokes of two rivers discovered bt him falling into the Gulf of Car pentaria to which he had given the name of Albert and Flinders rivers They are said to be small but there is eviderlce of their being greatly swollen at certaill times of the year as rushes grass c were found adhering to the branches of the trees twents feet above the present level of the water In connexion mtith Australia I nzay mention that Depuch Islanal one of the Forestier group lying on the west coast of that continent has been lately visited by Captain Wickham who describes it as a large pile of greenstone rocks rising 514 feet above the level of the sea while the opposite coast only one mile distant is quite flat It has no other vegetation than a few stunted gumtrees and a coarse wiry grass The islands of Forestiers group re visited by the natives of the main fur fish and turtle There is a aiery good and well sheltered anchorage off the sandy beach on the NE side of Depuch Islands and a trifling supply of firewood may be ottained but water is not to be depended upon at all seasons The most

Naturalist to the ex pedition of the Beagle under Captain Robert Fitzroy this work which is a monograph of considerable interest to physical geographyX is en titled On the Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs These e2ctraordinary phaenomena in the construction of the worlds surface as abundant in tWe tropical as they are rare in the extratropical re gions are divided by Mr Darwin into Atoles or Lagoon Islands  Barrier or Encircling Reefs and Fringing or Shore Reefs They sometimes penetrate to very great depths and present to the soundingline the appearances of precipitous cliSs collsequently firom the limited depths to which it is supposed that reefbuilding polypifers can flourish and from other circumstances it may be pre sumed that the foundation on which the coral has primarily attached has subsiled alld tliat during this downward movement the reefs have grown upwards This conclusion Mr Darwin thinks satis factorily explains the outliIle and general form of the reefs as well as the peculiarities of their structllre The distriblltion likewise of the different kinds of coral reefsX and their position with relation to the areas of recent elevation and to the points subject to volcanic eruptions agree with this theory of their origin Besides a variety of these reef islands which are particularised in two annexed plates there is also a map embracing the

It will be finished nest yeal hen we are promised a detailed account of it In our own country Mr Bielfield has produced a papiermache relief of the Pyrelees and some others and more recently SIr

mecllanical alplications f imlrovements in art and science to the extellsion of geograplicll kno ledge from an ansiety to lose llo opportunity of making more generally knon whatever may contribute to render our pllrsuits popular and to increase thelr tItility but in doing so GentlemeI I fear that I have detained 5OU too long I llave but a single word to add Tlle study of geography is the most natural as it is the most useful of all human pursuits The momellt se step beyond our own threshold ne are entering on a world comparatively unknown to us and this is the case as we go oll New scenes are continually unfolcling themselves before v1s historical poetical practical bute see nothingme understand nothing we invent llothing we seek for and we find nothing unless e comprehend in our minds eye a locus in quo a locus ad quem a loc2xs a quo lVhere we are whither we are poing whence me conze all enter into our daily actions and are all geogralhical questions The first looks we real Homer for instance Livy the Bible are all based on geugrdphical and topograIhical identificatiolls hence we begin and to these re must return I have observed before that though geography may be devoid of the charms of other ststematic sciences though it does not lend itself to brilliant tlleorics tllough it scarcely atlmits of the most irlnocent speculations tbougll it treats merely of dry mattersMiscellaneotls lxxxis of fact yet has geography other and perhaps superior claims upon your regarcl It looks alone to truth as its object and not to a fleeting abstract ideal truth but one which is at once intelligible solid alld im perishable the absolute and relative positions of definite and fixed places these once agreed upon no further doubt or discussion are required the object is gained you have got what you were in search of and you instantly set out in pursuit of other game equally tangible and as accessible as that from which you start Of the extent of our sciellce there cannot be two opinions It embraces the whole globe on and in which we live and have our being all the interests all the occu pations of men are more or less dependent upon it It is the main spring of all the operations of war and of a11 the negociations of a state of peace and in proportion as any one nation is the foremost to extend her acquaintance with the physical conformation of the earth alld the water which surrounds it will ever be the opportunities she will possess and the responsibility she will incur for extending her commerce for enlarging her powers of civilizing the fet henighted portions of the globe and for bearing her part in forwarding and direct ing the destinies of mankind VOL XII

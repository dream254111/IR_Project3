J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,108166,ON A NEW EQUIATOMIC COMPOUND OF BICYANIDE WITH BINOXIDE OF MERCURY,I206994, 113  VIII ON A NEW EQUIATOMIC COMPOUND OF BICYANIDE WITH BINOXIDE OF MLERCURY Y JAMES F W JOHNSTON ESQ MA FRS PROFESSOR OF CHEMISTRY AND MLIINE RALOGY IN THE UNIVERSITY OF DURHAM RECEIVED MARCH 21READ APRIL 11 1839 WHEN HYDROCYANIC ACID OF CONSIDERABLE STRENGTH 10 TO 20 PER CENT IS AGITATED WITH RED OXIDE OF MERCURY IN LARGE EXCESS A WHITE COMPOUND IS OBTAINED INTERMIXED WITH THE RED OXIDE ON WHICH COLD WATER HAS VERY LITTLE ACTION IF THE MIXTURE BE COL LECTED ON THE FILTER AND TREATED WITH BOILING WATER THE NEW COMPOUND IS SEPARATED FROIM THE EXCESS OF OXIDE AND AS THE SOLUTION COOLS IS DEPOSITED ON THE SIDES OF THE VESSEL IN THE FORM OF A WHITE INCRUSTATION ADHERING STRONGLY AND CONSISTING OF AN AGGREGATION OF COLOURLESS TRANSPARENT FOUR SIDED ACICULAR PRISMS IN FAVOURABLE CIR CUNMSTANCES I HAVE OBTAINED IT IN SUCH PRISMS HALF AN INCH IN LENGTH BUT NOT SUFFI CIENTLY PERFECT TO ADMIT OF MEASUREMENT THIS SALT IS REMARKABLY DISTINGUISHED FROM THE BICYANIDE BY ITS SPARING SOLUBILITY IN COLD WATER BY THE STRONG ALKALINE REACTION EXHIBITED BY ITS SOLUTION AND BY ITS RELATIONS TO HEAT HEATED GENTLY IN THE AIR IT BLACKENS SLIGHTLY AND THEN EXPLODES WITH LITTLE NOISE BUT IF IT BE HEATED IN LARGER QUANTITY 5 TO 10 GRS AND IN A CLOSE TUBE IT EXPLODES WITH A LOUD DETONATION AND SHIVERS THE TUBE INTO FIRAGMENTS IT DOES NOT EXPLODE UNDER THE BLOW OF A HAMMER BURNED WITH BICHROMATE OF POTASH OR OXIDE OF COPPER IT GIVES OFF A GAS WHICH CON SISTS OF NITROGEN AND CARBONIC ACID IN THE PROPORTION OF ONE VOLUME TO TWO THUS 1 131 VOLS TREATED WITH CAUSTIC POTASH LEFT  47 239 VOLS TREATED WITH CAUSTIC POTASH LEFT   79 2 122 VOLS TREATED WITH

IN DILUTE MURIATIC ACID AND GENTLY HEATED IT EMITS THE ODOUR OF PRUSSIC ACID IF SULPHURETTED HYDROGEN BE PASSED THROUGH THE SOLUTION IN WATER A PIRECIPI TATE AT FIRST WHITE AND AFTERWARDS BECOMING BLACK IS THROWN DOWN TO THE SOLUTION FILTERED AND HEATED TO DRIVE OFF THE EXCESS OF HYDROSULPHURIC ACID SULPHATE OF IRON AND AFTERWARDS CAUSTIC POTASH WERE ADDED WHEN A PRECIPITATE OF PRUSSIAN BLUE FELL THE SALT THEREFORE CONTAINS MDCCCXXXIX QMR JOHNSTON ON A NEW EQUIATOMIC COMPOUND 1 CYANOGEN SINCE ITS SOLUTION WHEN DECOMPOSED BY HYDROSSLPHURIC AND HYDRO CHLORIC ACID GIVES HYDROCYANIC ACID 2 ITS ALKALINE REACTION INDICATES AN EXCESS OF MERCURY 3 THAT THIS EXCESS IS IN THE STATE OF OXIDE IS SHOWN BY THE DETONATING PROPERTY OF THE SALT THE SUDDEN DECOMPOSITION BEING DUE TO THE ACTION OF THE OXYGEN ON A PORTION OF THE CARBON OF THE CYANOGEN HEATED TO INCIPIENT DECOMPOSITION THE SALT LOSES NO WEIGHT IT IS THEREFORE ANHY DROUS 29275 GRAINS DISSOLVED IN HYDROCHLORIC AND PRECIPITATED BY HYDROSULPHURIC ACID GAVE 29245 GRAINS OF BISULPHURET OF MERCURY  86191 GRAINS OF METALLIC MERCURY PER CENT 2927 GRAINS GAVE 2915 GRAINS BISULPHURET  85933 HG PER CENT 3493 GRAINS GAVE 3468 GRAINS

CARBON PER CENT THE SMALL QUANTITY OF WATER OBTAINED IN THE FIRST ANALYSIS WAS OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTAL AND THEREFORE THE WATER WAS NEGLECTED IN THE SECOND AND SINCE THE NITROGEN IS TO THE CARBON AS ALREADY SHOWN IN THE PROPORTION OF ONE VOLUME OR ATOM TO TRWO 5203 CARBON THE RESULT OF THE TWO VERY APPROXIMATE ONES WHICH SHOULD BE NEAREST THE TRUTH INDICATES 6025 OF NITROGEN SINCE 152875  177036

PROTOXIDE AND A LITTLE METALLIC MERCURY THAT IS A PORTION OF IT IS DECOMPOSED PROBABLY ACCORDING TO THE FOLLOWING FORMULA HGCY2 HGO2  3 HO  HGCY  HGO  NH3 2 C 02 THE REDUCTION OF THE MERCURY BEING THE CONSEQUENCE OF A SECOND REACTION 2 CAUSTIC AMMONIA THROWS DOWN FROM A COLD SOLUTION OF THIS SALT A COPIOUS AND BULKY WHITE PRECIPITATE FROM A HOT SOLUTION THE PRECIPITATE IS SLIGHTLY YELLOWISH THE SUPERNATANT LIQUID ON EVAPORATION GIVES PURE BICYANIDE OF MERCURY THE PRE CIPITATE WHEN DRIED AT 212 FAHR AND HEATED IN A CLOSE TUBE OVER A LAMP GIVES OFF AMMONIA WATER AND METALLIC MERCURY IT IS PROBABLY THE SAME COMPOUND WHICH IS OBTAINED BY DIGESTING RED OXIDE OF MERCURY IN CAUSTIC AMMONIA AND WHICH IS SUP POSED TO BE REPRESENTED BY ONE OR OTHER OF THE FORMULE 3 HG  4 NH3 8 H OR HG  2 HG  2 N H2  12 H 3 A SOLUTION OF SAL AMMONIAC THROWS DOWN A YELLOW PRECIPITATE THE SUPERNATANT LIQUID HAVING A STRONG ALKALINE REACTION ON HEATING THE PRECIPITATE IS REDISSOLVED AMMONIA IS GIVEN OFF AND THE ALKALINE REACTION DISAPPEARS THE DIRECT ACTION HERE IS THE CHANGE OF THE BINOXIDE INTO BICHLORIDE AND THE LIBERATION OF AMMONIA ACCORDING TO THE FORMULA HG CY2  HG 02  2 N H4 C1  HG CY2  HG C12  2 N H 0 THE WHITE PRECIPITATE IS A SECONDARY RESULT DUE TO THE ACTION OF THE FREE AMMONIA AS ABOVE MENTIONED AND WHICH CONSEQUENTLY DISAPPEARS WHEN THE AMMONIA IS DRIVEN OFF BY HEAT IN THIS CASE HOWEVER SINCE BICHLORIDE IS PRESENT THE WHITE PRE CIPITATE WILL NOT BE THE SAME AS IS PRODUCED BY THE ACTION OF AMMONIA ON THE NEW SALT 2 BUT MAY CONSIST IN PART OR IN WHOLE OF THE LONGKNOWN HYDRARGYRUM PRECI PITATUM ALBUM THE TRUE COMPOSITION OF WHICH HG C12  HG  2 N H112 HAS BEEN RE CENTLY ESTABLISHED BY DR KANE THIS REACTION IS REPRESENTED BY THE FORMULA 2 HG CI2  4 N H3  HG C12  HG  2 N H2  2 N H4 CLI 4 THE FIXED ALKALINE CHLORIDES RENDER THE SOLUTION OF THE NEW SALT MILKY AND THROW DOWN A SMALL QUANTITY OF A WHITE PRECIPITATE THE LIQUID BECOMING MORE STRONGLY ALKALINE IN THIS CASE ALSO THE CHLORIDE GIVES UP ITS CHLORINE TO THE MERCURY AND THE FREE ALKALI CAUSES THE INCREASED CAUSTICITY OF THE SOLUTION THE MILKINESS I ATTRIBUTE TO THE PRESENCE IN SMALL QUANTITY EITHER OF AMMONIA OR OF SOME NEUTRAL SALT FOR MIATE  OF MERCURY THE DECOMPOSITION OF WHICH BY THE ALKALINE CHLORIDE CAUSES THE FORMATION OF AN EQUIVALENT PORTION OF CALOMEL IT IS KNOWN HOW READILY FORMIC ACID AND AMMONIA ARE PRODUCED AT THE EXPENSE OF CYANOGEN WHEN WATER IS PRESENT AND IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THE ACTION OF HEAT UPON THIS NEW DOUBLE SALT IN WATER VERY FRE QUENTLY GIVES RISE TO THESE PRODUCTS IN TREATING WITH BOILING WATER THE MIXTURE OF  THE REACTION IS THUS REPRESENTED N C  4 H O  H CL 03  N H3 Q2 115MR JOHNSTON ON A NEW EQUIATOMIC COMPOUND OXIDE OF MERCURY AND THIS SALT WHICH IS PRODUCED ON DIGESTING PRUSSIC ACID WITH THE LATTER IN EXCESS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE SALT IN SOLUTION COPIOUS BUBBLES OF GAS ARE EVOLVED THE SMELL OF AMMONIA BECOMES PERCEPTIBLE AND MUCH METALLIC MERCURY IS PRECIPITATED ON CONCENTRATING THE SOLUTIONS ALSO DECOMPOSITION TAKES PLACE WITH DEPOSITION OF METALLIC MERCURY AND WHEN THE CRYSTALLIZED SALT IS DISSOLVED IN BOILING WATER A BLACK SEDIMENT IN GREATER OR LESS QUANTITY IS GENERALLY OBSERVABLE IN THE SOLUTION THEREFORE WHEN COLD THE PRESENCE EITHER OF A TRACE OF A FORMIATE OR OF ANY AMMONIACAL SALT WOULD ACCOUNT FOR THE SLIGHT DEPOSIT WHICH OCCURS WHEN CHLORIDE OF POTASSIUM IS ADDED TO IT WHEN CHLORIDE OF MAGNESIUM IS EMPLOYED THE MILKINESS IS MORE SPEEDY AND MORE DISTINCT A LIGHT BULKY HYDRATE OF MAGNESIA BEING THROWN DOWN AS IS TO BE EXPECTED WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT ON PARTING WITH ITS CHLORINE THE NLAGNESIUM IS OXIDIZED AND SET AT LIBERTY IN A LIQUID WHICH CAN RETAIN VERY LITTLE OF IT IN SOLUTION IF THE SALT BE ADDED IN SUCCESSIVE QUANTITIES TO A CONCENTRATED BOILING SOLUTION OF CHLORIDE OF POTASSIUM IT IS LARGELY DISSOLVED AND ON COOLING THE BEAUTIFUL PEARLY SCALES OF THE COMPOUND OF BICYANIDE OF MERCURY WITH CHLORIDE OF POTASSIUM FALL DOWN THE SUPERNATANT LIQUID CONTAINS BICHLORIDE OF MERCURY AND CAUSTIC POTASH A SOLUTION OF IODIDE OF POTASSIUM PRODUCES ANALOGOUS COMPOUNDS AND REACTIONS AS DOES ALSO A SOLUTION OF CYANIDE OF POTASSIUM 5 THE SOLUTION OF THIS NEW SALT OXYCYANIDE AS HAS BEEN ALREADY STATED HAS A STRONG ALKALINE REACTION IF IT BE ADDED TO A VERY DILUTE SOLUTION OF NITRIC ACID TILL THE SOLUTION CEASES TO REDDEN LITMUS IT WILL BE FOUND TO DISSOLVE WITH GREAT EASE AND IN LARGE QUANTITY THE SOLUTION BY CAREFUL EVAPORATION GIVES LONG DELICATE TRANSPARENT COLOURLESS QUADRANGULAR PRISMS OR HEXAGONAL PLATES AND PEARLY SCALES AND CRYSTAL LIZES TO THE LAST DROP AT 212 FAHR THESE CRYSTALS LOSE NOTHING AND THEREFORE CONTAIN NO WATER OVER THE LANP IN THE OPEN AIR THEY DECOMPOSE WITH A FLASH OF WHITE LIGHT GIVING OFF ME TALLIC MERCURY AND LEAVING A YELLOW RESIDUE IN A CLOSE TUBE THEY ARE DECOMPOSED WITH A SLIGHT DETONATION AND WITH THE EMISSION OF RED FUMES 38334 GRAINS OF THE OXYCYANIDE CAUTIOUSLY TREATED IN THIS WAY GAVE BEAUTIFUL CRYSTALS WEIGHING 4053 GRAINS EQUAL TO AN INCREASE OF 5728 PER CENT THE NEW COMPOUND THEREFORE CONSISTS OF CALCULATED FOUND ONE EQUIVALENT OF OXYCYANIDE HG CY2  HG 02   5923 94285 94272 ONE HALF EQUIVALENT OF NITRIC ACID 2 N 0     338 5715 5728 6261 100 100 THIS SALT IS READILY SOLUBLE IN WATER WHAT IS CHIEFLY INTERESTING IN REGARD TO ITS CON STITUTION AND PROPERTIES IS THAT THE ALKALINE REACTION OF TH T E OXYCYANIDE SHOULD BE FULLY  THIS SECOND REACTION IS DUE TO THE DECOMPOSITION OF THE FORMIATE OF AMMONIA BY THE AGENCY OF THE BINOXIDE OF MERCURY THUS H CQ O  N H3  HG 0O  N H  C 02  C O  HG 116OF BICYANIDE WITH BINOXIDE OF MERCURY DESTROYED BY SO SMALL A QUANTITY OF NITRIC ACID THIS FACT WOULD SEEM TO SHOW THAT THE BICYANIDE OF MERCURY AND CONSEQUENTLY OTHER COMPOUNDS OF THE SAME CLASS DO REALLY POSSESS SORNETHING OF THE CHARACTERS OF THE TRUE ACIDS HAVING THE POWER IF NOT OF COMPLETELY NEUTRALIZING A METALLIC OXIDE AT LEAST OF SO FAR MODIFYING ITS BASIC CHA RACTER AS MATERIALLY TO WEAKEN ITS NEUTRALIZING ACTION ON THE OXYGEN ACID 6 THIS IS FURTHER ILLUSTRATED BY THE ACTION OF ACETIC ACID ON THE OXYCYANIDE A WEAK SOLUTION OF THIS ACID DISSOLVES IT IN LARGE QUANTITY AND IF CAREFULLY SATURATED THE SOLUTION GIVES ON EVAPORATION A WHITE SALT LHAVING THE ODOUR OF ACETIC ACID WHICH LOSES NOTHING AT 220 FAHR BULT WHEN HEATED IN A CLOSE TUBE BLACKENS AND GIVES OFF CYANOGEN METALLIC MERCURY AND A STRONG ODOUR OF ACETIC ACID IN PREPARING THIS SALT IT IS DIFFICULT SO PERFECTLY TO NEUTRALIZE THE ACETIC ACID THAT DURING THE EVAPORA TION ANY EXCESS THAT MAYBE PRESENT SHOULD NOT AS IT BECOMES CONCENTRATED DECOM POSE SOME OF THE BICYANIDE WHICH THE SOLUTION CONTAINS ON THE FOLLOWING RESULTS THEREFORE I DO NOT PLACE NMUCH RELIANCE THOUGH THEY SERVE TO SHOW BY HOW SMALL A QUANTITY OF THIS ACID THE OXYCYANIDE MAY BE PERFECTLY NEUTRALIZED INCREASE 49 GRAINS OF OXYCYANIDE GAVE 4994 OF THE NEW SALT  1918 PER CENT 34567 GRAINS OF OXYCYANIDE GAVE 3536 OF THE NEW SALT

YET I WOULD BE UNDERSTOOD AS REPRESENTING THE CONSTITUTION ABOVE GIVEN FOR THIS SALT AS OPEN TO FUTURE CORRECTION I HAVE TRIED ALSO SEVERAL OTHER ORGANIC ACIDS AND HAVE FOUND THAT WITH THE BENZOIC AND CITRIC ACIDS SOLUBLE AND CRYSTALLIZABLE SALTS MAY BE OBTAINED AND WITH TARTARIC ACID A COMPOUND WHICH AFTER BEING CRYSTALLIZED IS DECOMPOSED BY WATER INTO A SOLUBLE AND AN INSOLUBLE PORTION OXALIC ACID GIVES A WHITE PRECIPITATE AND THE FILTERED SO LUTION ON EVAPORATION TWO SALTS ONE IN WHITE PRISMS THE OTHER IN YELLOWISH CRYSTALS I HAVE NOT SUBJECTED ANY OF THESE COMPOUNDS TO ANALYSIS 7 WHEN AN ACID SOLUTION OF NITRATE OF SILVER IS POURED INTO A HOT SATURATED SOLU TION OF THE OXYCYANIDE A SHOWER OF BEAUTIFUL PURE WHITE PRISMATIC CRYSTALS FALLS  WHEN A SOLUTION OF THE BICYANIDE IS HEATED WITH

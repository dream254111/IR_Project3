prosperity eludes a specific answer The tariff is but cne of a thou sand factol s affecting the countrys welfale and lDy no means among the most important Its eSects are so covered and hidden by the etTects of other causes that it is practically impossible to tfollow them out to their end There is no subject on which so much unwarranted nonsense is talked on both sides as on the 3uestion of protection He svho approflches it with so cocksure an air as Mr Thompson and tells us glibly about the beneficent teffect ezrery high tariff has exelcised and about  the general em barrassment which followed low duties i5 on the face of it in competent to tell us any thing worth listenillg to NOTES AND NEWS THE third number of the Irtergcrztzonclles 24ocAzzar FtJogo Zogie is full of interesting material The journal llas rapidly be come the principal source of information to those svhose stuclies refer to ethnological collections Each numer contains beautifully engraved colorplates showing interesting specimens The text gises elaborate descriptions of these plates and reports of numer ous museums descriptions of important accessions of the organi zation of the collections and information regarding smaller collec tions which srould otherwise be inaccessible to the student The last tlumber contains a description of the extensive collection made by Adrian Jacobsen among the Golds and Gilyaks and a description of the native tribes of Liberia Besides this it contains interestin reports of curlent literature recent extplorations and new coilec tions The second annual

that whole region ihe cost is estimated at I0000000 The work would occupy 2sE0000 men for five yearse  D1 M Eschenhagen in a recent number of Petervzassgs MZtteSGZGngeS calls attention to an attempt to explain the magnetic polarity o the earth and the situation of the magnetic poles The theory was first propounded by Dr Menzzer He assumes that electrical currents flowing from east to xvest cause the magnetic po larity of the earth If the surface of the earth were solid tllese cur rents snhichdepend upon the rotation of the earth would run exactly sleast by west This is approximately the case in the strata lying be low the average depth of the ocean In the highest layers hovfever the distribution of land and water affects these currents When entering the ocean they cause a locomotion of the water and thus the geographical features of the earths surface affect the polarity of the globe Eschenhagen shows by a simple construction what this effect would be on the southern hemisphere He assumes that there are no electrical currents whatever in the ocean and cornputes the influence of those of the continents accorcling to the size shape and position of the latter The result of this cormputa tion sllows that the magnetic pole would be situated in latitude 76 50 south and longitucle I8348 According to Ross its position is latitude 75 6 south and longitude I7I 50 As the influeruce of tlle Antarctic continent has not been included in this computation the result must be consiclered very satisfactory and encouraging to further work on Menzzers hypothesis The PoAzZgcS Sczegre Qgarfer for September contains three articles on constitutional questions the most important of them be ing that by Sydney G Fisher on the  Suspension of Gabeas CorXis during the B7ar of the Rebellion Mr Fisher reviews the action of President Lincoln in suspending the Sabeas corSisgs by his own fiaty and after considering the arguments on both sides comes to the conclusion that such action by the executive authoritv was wholly unwarranted The Constitution in his opinion gises the power to suspend the writ to Congress ancl not to the President and with this opinion we cordially agree The subject is one of great importance and it is unfortunate that the Supreme Court has never had the opportunity of passing judgment upon it so as to settle the question authoritatively lUr William A Dunning has a someN7hat rambling article on the  Inequality of the States in which he expresses the opinion that owing to certain conditions imposed by Congress at the time of reconstruction some of the Southern States are not on an equality with their sisters Mr Doughertys paper on the  Constitutions of the State of New York is the first of a series and will interest the people of the State and students of institutions elsewhere Prof R M Smith concludes his discussion of the immigration question expressing himself strongly in favor of restriction yet he has little to propose in the way of restrictive measures beyond the more rigid enforcement of existing laws The article in the QvarSerdy that will be likely to attract most attention is the opening one by George Gunton on the  Economic and Social Aspect of Trusts in which he takes the ground that these colossal combinations of capital  are the natural consequence of modern industrial differentiation and in their nature are economically wholesome and politically and socially harmless He confines himself mainly to the economic aspect of the subject and overlooks some important facts connected with it but his essay will be useful as a corrective of extravagant and un intelligent views on the other side of the question On the whole this number of the QvtrferSy is one of the best that has yet appeared Harper  Brothers

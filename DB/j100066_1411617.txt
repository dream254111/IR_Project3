explanation but simply aim to establish a fenv steps in that direction The il lusion is that so well marked in figure 1 first described by Zollnerl In this figure the main lines appear very far from

in a variety of ways whatpart they played in the total effect it will be more acceptable to substitute for this rather laborious process an exposition beginning with the simplest type of the under lying illusion and building it up step by step to its most com plicated form When viewing two lines separated by a space we are able to connect the two mentally and determine whether they are or are not continuations of one another but if we add to one of the lines another meeting it so as to form an angle the lines which seemed continuous no longer appear so and those c A 8 FIG 2 nvhich were not continuous may ap pear so In Fig 2 the continuation  of the line A appears to fall below the  line B and similarly the continuation  of C apparently falls to the right of D  But in reality A is continuous with  B and C with D If we cover the D line C A and B seem colltinuous ffius indicating that the illusion is due to the angle What is true of obtuse angles is true though to a less estent of right angles and of acute angles in brief the degree of this illusion of discontinuity increases and decreases as the angle increases anf1 decreases The figures to prove this the reader can easily supply further illustration thereof will appear later This is the simplest form of a sense deception that underlies ver many familiar but more elaborate figures The principle therein involved we generalize as follows Calling the direc tion of an allgle the direction of the line that bisects it and is pointed toward the apes then the dtrection of the stdes of an angle wtl be devtated toward the dtrectzon of the angte A very important corollary of this main generalization emphasizes the point that just as the deviation of direction is greater with obtuse than with acute angles so also whenSTUDIES FROM UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN 383 obtuse and acute angles are so placed as to lead to opposite kinds of deviatioll the former will outweigh the latter and the illusion will appear according to the direction of the ob tuse angle We proceed to notice a few of the means by which the illusion may be varied and tested A relatively large dis tance between the lines the continuity of which is to be judged produces a more marked illusion than a relatively small distance The appropriate figures the reader can read ily supply In other words opportunity must be given for the eye to lose itself in passing from the one line to the other The degree of illusion may be increased by increasing the number of angles in various ways We may draw a series of koblique lines parallel to the line C in Fig 2 and joining the  EEs 3 line A Or again we may draw a line parallel to C from the lefthand end of line B This gives Fig 3 in which the two horizontal lines seem to be on entirely diSerent planes The direction of the deviations induced by these angles being op posite in tendency the result is quite marked Againwe may add a second line parallel to the real continuation which will be the apparent continuation and we may further strengthen the tendency to regard the noncontinuous line as the true tcontinuation by shading them alike or otherwise differentiat ing them Again we may draw this second line slightly  B    FIGE 4 oblique instead of parallel with the first line with good suc cess this is done in Fig 4 Both of these tests can be made384 JASTROW accurate by measuring the masimum deviation between the parallels or between the parallel and the adjacentoblique line which the eye will tolerate and still retain the illusion of the false continuation or again the angle alone might be drawn and the error measuredwhich the subject would make in add ing what appears to him a true continuation of the sides 0n the basis of the general principle above enunciated we may proceed to the e2rplanation of a series of more complet figeres We trn to Fig 6 Efere the effect of the obtuse D  R    I  I  G FIG S angle ACD is to make the continuation of the line AB fall belowo the line FG1 nvhile the eSect of the acute angle is just the reverse but by our corollary the former preponderates over the latter and directs the illusion The line EC ailde nothing essential to the figure for it simply introduces two angles ECB and ACE which reinforce the angles ACD and BCD Like wise the line BC might be omitted or covered and leave the iJlasion essentially unaltered In Fig 6 we observe a slightly    CIG 6 different form of the illusion the confinuation of each line ap pearing to run below that of the other so that these oont inua tions would meet at an obtuse angle A11 theee variations fol lomr from the dietum that ffie direction of ffie side of an angle is deviated toward the dtrection of the angle We mayfurther notethose cases in which theefectof each angle is counteracted by that of another resulting in the dis appearance of all illusion this occure when all the angles are equaJ that is are right angles This appears in Fig 7 and would appear equally well

rightf the left hand line toward the left i e they are likewise deviated toward the directions of their angles This tendency of the sides of an angle to be deviated towawd the direction of the angle may result not only    I 1S  FIG 8 in lnaking conOuous liIles appear discontinuons but also in making parallel lines appear to diverge from psllelism We may further illustrate tle re   lation of divergence from colltinui   V  ty to divergence from parallelism    by rotating the right half of Fig   3 through 180 and placing it under    t   the left half In this way we obtain   Fig 8 which shows that the same      angles as readily produce light devi   ation from parallelism as from con    v    tinuity To strengthen this illusion       we multiply the number of oblique   lines and thus of obtuse angles In    i   SQ doing we unavoidably introduce       acute angles but as before their    effect is outrweighted by tat of       the obtuse angles We thus ob       tain Fig 9 in which the paral   lel lines diverge markedly above   FIG 91 The oblique lines have been made shorter but this does not add any thing essentially diffierent It keeps the flgure compact and thus readlly allows the judgment of parallelism 386 J A STROW and converge below If we now carrsr the diagonal lines across the vertical ones the illusion remains and it is clear from our dictum that it should v

JASTROW ence and divergence of the lines is greatly emphmized The points at which the apparent change of direction occurs are Vlso emphasized by cross lines Fig 17 adds the further lll Fso 17  principle that the extent of the apparent deviation varies di rectly with the size of the angle for as each successive angle increases or decreases the deviation increases or de creases so that the straight line becomes a line with a con tinuous change of direction that is a curve as before the obtuse angles are the significant ones Eelmholtz finds a similar illusion in which motion is involved and which Prof James thus describes Fig 18  Let A B be a line drawn on paper a D E the tracing made over this line by the point of a compass steadily followed by the eye as it moves As the compass point passes from C to D the line appears to move downward as it passes from D to E the line appears to move upward at the same time the whole line seems to incline itself in the direction F G during the first half of the compasss movement and in the direction E I during the last half the change from one in clination to another being quiX distinct as the compass point passes over D The line formed by the movement of the compass points acts as two oblique lines crossing the horizon tal one Curved lines produce the same illusion as may beSTUDIES FROM UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN 389 seen in Fig 19 by the apparent sagging of the lines at the centre The illusioll is here strengthened by the presence of several curves 1  PIG 19 1 Wundt figures two illusions which apparently are exceptions to our generalization and nvhich accordingly demaud attelltion In Fig 20 the horizontal iine appears as two lines tipping slightly dowaward E   Fs 20 from the centre Our flrst impulse would be to regard the illusion as due to the angles ACE and BCF and we should according to our dictum expect thelinesto tilt upward slightly But remembering the greater effect of obtuse angles we should view the figure as composed of Fig 6 in which the two horizontal lines are approached to one another until theymeet when by the eXect of the angle iICF EC is tipped down and by the action of BCE aB is tipped down That such is really the natural way of looking at it will be evident from Fig 14 at the centre of the upper line we have the very same arrangement of lines producing the same effect anl immediately in conjunction with the effective obtuse angles Wundts ne2rt figure is more difflcult to explain Fig 21 There the IE X cJ   FIG 21 lines tip up at the ends and there are apparently no angles which nvould malre them do 80 We have come to the view that this figure is a modifica tion of Fig 22 Eiere the obtuse angles are present and determine the FIG 22 illusion The oblique lines need not join to produce the effiect and the short vertical line as in the other cases simply brings out the point at which its change of direction takes place We judge the tipping of the lines by reference to a horizontal which we carry with U8 or have sug gested by the line of the page or the many horizontal objects we behold WVe must likewise infer that the tipping in Fig 21 is due to the obtuse angle formed by one side really present and another suggested ollly by the continuation of CE and CF The following considerations may serve to remove the artificiality of this explanation 1 we do frequently judge by reference to imagined lines e g our horizontal and vertical 2 we use suggested lines in illusions 3 the centre of Fig 5 above presents Fig 21 as the end term of a series and in conjunction with the efFective obtuse angle 4 the illusion increases as this imagined obtuse angle increases but deereases as the real atute angle increases390 JASTROW The last illusion to which we shall attempt to apply our dictum is the familiar one whereby a square enclosed within a circle seems to bend in the circle at the four points of con tact That the circle contributes no essential part to the illusion can be shown in Fig 23 in which the rectangle in F   g L I X PEs 23 scribed in the hexagon bends in the sides of the hexagon at the points of contact Furthermore the fact that the he2r agon shows the illusion even better than the square suggests that the larger angle is the more effective This illusion we regard as a complicated form of Fig 20 inverted From our former ezrplanation it is already clear why we should have a large obtuse angle at the point of contact instead of the act ual continuous line The portion of the curve adjoining the point of contact acts as a straight line as it also does in Fig 19 The effective angles are thus the angles of which ABCT and DBF are types The application of our generalization toS forms of illusion not taken into account in the formulation is a very gratifying indezr of its value We turn finally to a brief account of the literature of the topic Zollner accidentallynoticedthe illusion on a pattern designed for a print for dress goods Ee established the following points 1 the illusion is greatest when the main parallel lines are inclined 45 to the horizontal 2 the illu sion disappears when viewed at a slight angle as by holding one corner of the figure up to the eye 3 it vanishes when held too far from the eyes to clearly see the cross striatons 4 the illusion is as good for one eye as for two 5 theSTUDIES FROM UNIVERSITY OF WdSCONIN strength of the illusion varies with the inclination of the oblique to the vertical lines In later studies he determined that 6 the angle between oblique and vertical lines at which the illusion is greatest is 30 degrees 7 the illusion appears under the illumination of an electric spark quite as strongly as otherwise 8 viewing it through red glass weakens it He also answers criticisms by lIelmholtz and lIering His e2rplanation is curious and in its details unintelligible lIe draws an analogy between these and illusions of motion and makes all depend on the view that it takes less time and is easier to infer divergence or convergence than parallelism 1 Why the illusion should vary with the angle under this theory he does not ezrplain the fact that it is greatest at 45 he regards as the result of less visual ezrperience ill oblique directions Apart from the fact that this theory does not ex plain and is not applicable to many of the figures it can be experimentally disproved by a figure similar to Fig 1 but with the lines actually inclined but apparently parallel as suggested by Hering Eere really diverent lines all seem parallel showing that the illusion does not consist of the inference of parallelism or nonparallelisIal but of a certain angular distortion of the real relations of lilles Eering Beitrage zur Physzotogte 186l pp 69 80 added several of the figures above noticed Figs 141519 Ee bases his explanation upon the curvature of the retina and the resulting difference in the retinal images of arcs and circles Ee figures this explanation for the square enclosed in a circle and applies it to the rest Ee criticises Zollner and dismisses the fact that the illusion is strongest in oblique direetions as irrelevant In a later article Eermann III p 373 he brings in the additional statement that acute angles appear relatively too large and obtuse ones too small 1 It is well to note that Poggendorf called Zollners attention to a further illusion in his figure This was printed in deep black linesZ and the two parts of the oblique line crossing it seemed not quite con tinuous i e the illusion of Fig 10 with a broad black line for the rectangle Zollner regarded this as unrelated to the other and accredYlted it to astigmatism 41 Sundt cited by Aubert attempted to get an experimental proof of Herings view but his results at close distances which alone are rel evant7 failed to cotroborate the theory Sundt also determined the relation between the size of the figure and the ditance from the eye at which the illusion disappeared 392 JASTROW Ee also prints a figure Fig 24 based upon the fact of greater illusion in oblique directions This figure as Aubert has pointed out clearly refutes Eerings theory for it shows I S SN   qg  it g E M  SS  X i m S   g Di I   FIG 24 a variation in the strength of the illusion while the retinal image remains the samel A ubert Physiologie der NetzAaut 1865t pp 270272 con fines his attention to a notice of the results and views of others closing with the sentence  I am unable to give any explanation of Zollners illusion  In a later workt fPhysi ologische Optik 1876 pp 629631 he practically repeats his former statements and mentions that Volkmann ex plained it by an apparent alteration of the plane in which the oblique lines appeared i e they appeared in a plane in clined to that of the paper and the inclination of the long parallel lines to this plane appears as inclination toward one another Classen fPhysiologie des Sesichtssinns after disagreeing with all previons theories gives his own explanation in these words  Now the cause of the illusion is clear in recogniz ing the directions of the converging and diverging oblique lines we judge them by their relations to the vertical ones These recede from the oblique lines where they diverge and approach them where they converge and thus the directionSTUDIES FROM UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN 393 of the verticals is regarded as a separation toward the side of convergence alld an approachillg toward the side of diverg ence Classen noticed that the illusion appeared as soon as a pair of parallels was crossed by a pair of oblique lilles which formed an acutallgle at their junction He insists that a pair of lines of opposite direction is necessary to pro duce the illusion and leads one to infer that if this were not Bo his theory would be disproved This can be shown in various ways e g by drawing only the left half of Fig 9 and substituting a parallel line for the right half the illusion remains though not so distinctly Lipps Grbndthatsachen des Seetenlebens 1883 pp 526 530 regards the illusion as primarily psychical whatever parts the movements of the eyes play being determined by the attention lIe says  If we draw Fig 25 the line pqn P m b a m b FIG 25 upon the line ab and follow the latter with our eye we shall on reaching the point m tend for a moment to slip off at and to follow mp without distinctly realizing that we are not still on the main line This makes us feel as if the remainder mb of the main line were but a little away from its original di rection The illusion is apparent in the shape of a seeming approach of the ends bb of the two main lines Prof James whose words we have been quoting adds This to my mind would be a more satisfactory explanation of this class of illusions than any of those given by previolls authors were it not again for what happens in the skin Prof James thinks that this class of illusions belongs to the field of sensation rather than of unconscious inference lIoppe Physzotogtsche Optzk 188l pp 73 83 gives a careful and critical digest of the views of others which he finds it difflcult to understand His own is no less so but seems to be that our eyes and our attention are drawn to those lines that do most to fill out space and that we run out the oblique lines until they meet from this imagined point of junction the real parallels look divergent Whell we care fully fixate the parallel lines the illusion is avoided Or394 JASTROW againt  we follow the fitled middle space according to the aourse of the oblique lines and neglect the black parallel straight lines or because the latter are thus less noticed and viewed from a greater distance we strengthen the ap pearance of their separation by the iAdirect view we obtain of them2 The illusion is not retinal because it vanishes in the after image it is intellectual in origin It is difficult to see how Lippss view would be espressed so as to apply to Fig 2 or why the illusion should disappear in Fig 7 Hoppes view is open to the same obJection as Classens and is re futed by the same figures Wundt Phystotogische Psychologtet 3d ed II pp 124 132 although bringing in other facbrs as well makes his main argument rest upon the view that we tend to overesti mate acute and underestimate obtuse angles Ee gives no proof of this fact if fact it be nor explains in what manner the error appears Ee seems to mean that in judging of the direction of the sides of an anglet we view acute angles as larger than they really are If this be sot there mut be some angle at which the illusion disappears and this would seem to be the right angle however we get the illusion with right angles Again in Fig 5 and many similar figures that we could construct the acute angle judged by the same means would appear to be smaller than it really is and in many respects acute and obtuse angles are affected alike In com mon with others Wundt regards the increase of the error at 45 as due to a less esact visual experience Pisco Licht und Farbe 2d ed 1876 p 268 gives no e2rplanationX but adds the beautiful Fig 16 Helmholtz PAysiotog Optzk pp 564574 presents a peculiar view of the subject He begins with the illusion of the deviation in direction of the two parts of an obliqlle line separated by a rectangle and regards the particular cause of this illusion to be the aurving in of the oblique lines as they meet the sides of the rectangle or heavy vertical lines More over this is especially true of small figures in which as a whole the illusion is more marked This deviation then at least in small figures is due to irradiation IIe supple ments this explanation with one that will apply to large figures and to Zollners illusion He says We may con sider these illusions as new earamples of the law above indi aated according to which acute angles being small in size and clearly limited appear in general as too large when com pared with right or obtuse angles DIoreovert movement plays a large part in at least some of the figures and in these the illusion disappears under precise fisation and the electric spark This effect of movement is illustrated by the instance395 STUDES FROM UNIYEITY OF WISCONSIN gited above and leads to a sort of contrast whereby a clearer aiffsrence seems a larger one Besides the general obJection that so many principles are brought in to explain facts so clearly belonging to one sphere and the further objections which have already been advanced against the alleged over estimation of acute angles several detailed criticisms might be made In the first place Helmholtz has not shown that small figures present the illusion better than large ones in his figures he has drawn less than half as large an acute angle in the small figure as in the large one and this is the cause of the difference he observes iEtegarding the alleged urvature of the lines it is difficult to see it and it as well as the possibility of irradiation may be eliminated by drawing aLll the lines light and not allowing the oblique line to quite meet the vertical onesunder such circumstances the illusion persists Eelmholtzs chief argllment for the effect of fisation is drawn from the heavilydrawn form of Zollners figure in which he looks at the white bands with oblique lines running out like the feathers on an arrow and sees thern parallel but this is precisely what nzust occhr from the position of the angles the effect of each angle being compensated by another The two modes of drawing the figure make two figures of it The arguments from the electric spark experiments are cer tainly questionable both in fact and inference and it must be axlmitted that the entire treatment is unsatisfactory It will be seen that the field we have entered is a very complez one and that a most important problem Why do we deviate the sides of an angle toward the direction of an angletremains to be solved Eow far does this depend on eye movements how far upon inference and the liket The chief defect of former attempted explanations seems to us to consist in theorizing UpOIl too limited a range of facts What is true of one group of figures fails to apply to others Before an explanation can be satisfactory we must know precisely what it is that we are to explain and this necessitates a cor rect and comprehensive generalization of the facts this it is that we have attempted to supply Our study of these illusions leads us to regard them as esseIItially psychological in origin they are illusions of jlldg ment and not of sensation Furthermore we would regard 1hem as an outcome of the general principle that we are prone to judge relatively rather than absolutely that our perceptions differ atcording to their ensironmeIIt that a sense impression is not the same when presented alone and when in counec tion with other relaXd senseimpressioIIs s line presented396 3ASTROW by itself is a different object from a line as a part of an angle or of a figure However much we desire to consider the line independently of the angle we are unable to do so We have the direction of an angle and the direction of the lines that form the angle and we are unable to consider the latter abso lutely without reference to the former The more nearly the directions of the angle and of the sides coincide i e the smaller the angle the smaller will be the error induced by this relative mode of viewing the lines The whole series of illusions would thus be subsumed under the law of contrast or better of relativity and the different variations and degrees of the illusion would find their explanations in the readiness with which they suggest and enforce misleading comparisons In order to effiibit a tsope of illusions most readily explica ble from this point of view as well as to esemplify the sug gestiveness of the latter we will consider aIl allied group of usual illusions Just as the presence of angles modifies our judgment of the directions of their sides so too the angles will modify the apparent tengths of lines This form of contrast is most strikingly exhibited in Fig 26 and best by comparing I and IV i e cover up II and III It seems almost incredible that the horizontal portions of I and IV are of equal length and yet such is the case II and III supply the intermediate steps and in comparing the four figures the horizontal por tions seem to becomesuccessively shorter from I to VI while  I     III IV   FIG 26 in reality they are all one length lIere again the greater the angles formed at the extremities the

between the oblique lines It also shows very well by cutting the figures out of paper either as they are or as truncated pyramids by joining the ends of the oblique lines by a lme parallel to the horisontal one and viewing them against an appropriate background We may also be tempted to judge of tsro areas by their justaposed lines thus regarding one of two equal areas as larger than the other This is shown in Fig 27 which also l W I  L        v FIG 27 shows very well when the figures are cut out and moved about to assume various positions The upper figure seems larger because its long side is brought into contrast with the shorter side of the other figure Similarly 3 square resting on a cor ner seems larger than one restingon a sidebecause we then con trast the diagonal with the side Fig 28 on the following page presents another illustration of the same principles the lowver figure seems to be distinctly the larger and the contrast is emphasized because it is thrown entirelzy to one side of the figure In judging areas we cannot avoid taking into ac count the lengths of the lines by which the areas are limited and a contrast in the lengths of these is cartied over to the aomparision of the areas We Judge relatively even when we most desire to judge absolutely Relative distinctions and398 JASTROW the perception of relation seem to be more natural and sig nificant than absolute ones We cannot view the part as unrelated to the whole This is a widely applicable princi S   tS FIG 28 ple and is suggested as a convenient guiding principle by which the study of such illusions of sense may be profitably directed A STUDY OF INVOLUNTARY MOVEMENTS With the assistance of HELEN WEST The dictum that thought is repressed action most readily finds illustration in conditions of the nervous system varying somewhat from the normal It is easier to detect the 3ction of not definitely recognized lass in extreme forms than in average ones The modern view of morbid action however emphasizes the close relation of the abnormal to the normal there exists in the latter in germ and to a limited extent what is full grown and characteristic in the former If under great excitement and extreme fascination of the attention and in farrorably constituted individuals the involuntary moare ments are pronounced the rudiments of these mourements should be demonstrable in the average individual under nor mal conditions For this purpose delicate apparatus may be requisite and a variable amount of success is to be e2rpected The question of apparatus is of importance and our present study aims to do little more than describe the apparatus and illastrate what results may be obtained therewith399 STUDIES FROM UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN The apparatus is so simple that a brief description will doubtless be sufflcient to convey a clear idea of its mode of action There is first a piece of plate glass see Fig 29 S  E F1G 29 fiifteen inches square resting in a stout wooden frame this frame is mounted on three adjustable brass legs raising it an inch or so from the table By means of the screwadjust ments of the legs the plate glass is brought into exact level Three brass balls which must be very peRectly turned and polished spheres about threefourths of an inch in diameter are placed in the form of a triangle upon the plate upon these balls rests a very light crystalplate glass fourteen inches square mounted in a light wooden frame On the upper sur face of this plate is placed a piece of paper to hide the balls and on the paper we lightly rest the fingertips of our hand It is almost impossible to keep the plate from all motion for more than a few seconds the slightest movement of the hand slides the upper plate upon the balls To maintain the ap paratus in working order it is necessary to keep the glass and balls well polished by rubbing with a cloth and a little oil The recording of the movement is equally simple To the light frame is attached a slender rod about ten inches long bearing at its end a cork piercing this cork is a small glass tube and in the tube there is a glass rod snugly fitting the tllbe and drawn to a fine point The point of the rod traces the movement of the hand with great accuracy and not being rigidly fi2red can accommodate itself to all irregularities of movement or of the writing surface A piece of smoked paper stretched over a glass plate upon which a record is400 JASTROW made and a large screen to prevent the subject from seeing the record complete the apparatlls This apparatus enables us to record all movement in the horizontal plane and inas much as its chief purpose is to write slight involuntary move ments we have given it the name of the automatograph and may speak of such a record as an automatogram The type of an experiment is the following The subject places the fingertips of his estended right hand upon the glass he is told to hold the arm still and pay no attention to it Ee is asked to read some lines or colors or to count the beats of a metronome this naturally engages his attention When a11 is in readiness the operator drops the glass rod into the tube and the record begins When the subject has been occupied in this way for a minute or so we have as a ralet a very clear record of the direction of his attention in the au tomatogram Tn order to have a test by which to compare the relative Ssensibility of different persons for movements of this kind we arranged to have a number of persons go through a series of tests a typical result of each of which will be figured Each experiment occupied from about threefourths to two minutes and when possible we noted the progress of the record for each 15 or 30 seconds A series of patches of color 5X20 mm were placed in hori zontal rows on a vertical wall about ten feet distant The subject was required to read aloud the names of the colors The general tendency is for the hand involuntarily to move toward the colors with a variable degree of constancy rapid ity and directness An average result is shown in Fig 30 We have another record lasting but 45 seconds but covering 6 inches which in estent and directness is the most remark able of our records The appearance of the line is similar to that of Fig 30 but with several points at which the line is almost directly toward the colors 11  FIG 30

solve this problem the result seems to varywith individuals and with the sense organ engaged A s a prelimi nary result it may be worth recording that a number of measurements yielded an average rate of movement of about two inches to the minute toward the object thought of Of great importance is the nature of the individual difler ences in these experiments Our normal experience would naturally anticipate a diXerence about as characteristic at least as that of handwriting Any minute discussion of the point would be obviously premature but in general it seems possible to arrange these differences in types We should distinguish between those who move rapidly and directly and those who move slowly and circuitously between those in whom the movement quite exactly follows the line of attention and those in whom it does so only ap proximately or irregularly Instances of such distinctions have already been indicated We add Fig 40 which may be contrasted in regard to the FIGE 40

curve with Fig 31 the latter shows directness of movement and great estent the tracing rarely becoming confused by the hesitancy of the subject while in Fig 40 the movement is slow and the record involved by continual retracings of the path of movement Another important dis tinction relates to the time at which the most significant movements occur and mainly whether the first impulse is toward the obJect of attention followed by much hesitation of movement or whether at first there is little movement fol lowed after fatigue by the movement determined by the at tention We have many more of the former type than of the latter one of the former is presented in iFig 41 Figs 33 E  R     FIG 41 Counting beats of metronome IlllLstrates first impulse toward object of att8nu0h fol lowed by

it only here and there These types may possibly suggest what kinds of involun tary movements best subserve the purposes of the muscle reader all alike illustrate the general line of tendencies which he utilizes A very natural query relates to the possible induence of the position of the arm and body and also of such other facs lors as the pulse and respiration upon the character of the tracing The main distinction in regard to the position is whether the arm is 1 held straight outfromtheshoulderina line with the trunk or 2 at 90 from this position7 or 3 in an intermediate position In the first of these movements toward the front are obviously easier to make than move ments toward the rear and in both 1 and 2 movements toward the body are easier than those away from the body By changing the position of the object to which the attention was given we could thus favor or interiere with the tendency to involuntary movement in certain directions In our es periments we allowed the subject to assume a natural and comfortable position which was usually an intermediate one407 STUDIES FROM UNIVERSITY OF WlSCONSIN with the arm not fully extended This position allows move ment in a11 directions though it is still true that movements toward the front and toward the body are favored above move ments toward the rear and away from the body The direc tion of the attention is thus sometimes partially obliterated in some subjects but in most of them it appears in spite of this tendency This factor deserves a more special investigation While respiration may have some effect we are inclined to regard it as very small and the pulse as not entering into con sideration at all for in order to get the tracing of pulse and respiration by other apparatus with equal distinctness we had to magnify them very considerably The question of the precise significance of these movements is largely dependent in the testimony of the subjects While there are individual diSerences in this as in a11 other respects the consensus of the verdicts might be thus expressed at times we become aware that our hand has moved but rarely of the direction of its movement the movements are some times unconscious but always involuntary there is often great surprise at the result The one objective test we could apply was to intentionally simulate these movements and the result was measurably different from the genuine involuntary record It is hardly necessary to enlarge upon the bearings of these experiments upon the processes of muscle reading and kindred phenomena They indicate the close connection of mind and muscle and in demonstrating the extent of record able automatic movements suggest the many other and subtler means by which we may give to others some notion of what is going on in our own minds OBSERVATIONS ON THE ABSENCE OF THE SENSE OF SWrFJTT With the assistance of THEODORE KRONSHAGE The subject of our observations is a Mr E aged 21 years a student of this University who is deprived of all the sense of smell The defect is probably congenital and of nervous origin A s AIr Es knowledge of his defect was denied from such occasions as would occur in every day life our first step was to test the degree and estent of the anosmia We ap proached various substances to his nose asking him to inhale them and report the result we tried in this way strong liquid solutions of wintergreen bitter almonds ether alcohol ammonia cinnamon camphor etc Camphor produced very slight if any sensation and the same is true of wintergreen and cinnamon Bitter almonds ether and most markedly ammonia produced a sharp more or less stinging sensation 5408 JASTROW in the nose Alcohol was described as sweetish like per fllmes We ne2rt tried several substanees in pairs to deter mine how far wvhen first told which was which not by name butby calling one A and the other B he could distinguish between them and as a check against unconscious bias es periments in which one of the pair was distilled water were introducel This precaution was quite necessary for it happened that when bitter almonds and water were compared in this wayhe mistook them three times in five trials though professing te get some sensation from the bitter almonds when presented alone The water however was frequently recognized by its entire absence of any sensation of smell Such distinctions therefore as are perceived by him are by no means altogether clear With the pair ether and water eleven trials resulted in eleven correct answers the point of distinction being that ether opens up the throat like pep permint With wintergreen and bitter almond the latter yielding the distinctive effect there were only 3 errors in 18 trials With ether and ammonia both giving decided sensa tions but of somewhat different nature there were 2 errors in 8 cases this may however have been due to over stimula tion as the substances used were so strong that neither of us could take them to the nosewith comfort Ammoniawas described as immediately affecting the nose ether as going back to the throat and afEecting it With wintergreen and cinnamon neither yielding any definite sensation the result proved to be mere guesswork and the same is true of cinna mon and camphor Inasmuch as the sensation arising from the inhalation of alcohol was described as similar to that of perfumes alcohol being an ingredient of these we ascertained how far the pres ence or absence of alcohol could serve as a means of confu sion or indentification of substances We made a strong solution of wintergreen and of cinnamon in alcohol and from each of these Mr E obtained a similar but pronounced effect The attempt to distinguish between the two however resulted in as many failures as successes We next compared pure alcohol with wintergreen dissolved in 31cohol and no differ ence except of intensity was observed To complete the proof we made a solution of wintergreen in water and in alcohol The latter gave a distinct sensation the former almost nothing In all the eight trials the two were correctly distinguished The next point tested was whether distinctions of intensity within a perceived range of sensations were obtained We tried strong and weak alcohol with the result that in all cases eight they were correctly distinguished from oneSTUDIES FROM UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSH 409 znother the sensation was described as a  sweetish taste in the mouth In the above results indications were given that Mr E was less than normally sensitive to irritants To measure this difference we determined how many drops of very strong ammonia must be added to 100 cc of water 1 to produce a sensation 2 to make it objectionably strong We obtaimed the characteristic effect with but one drop in 200 cc and even one in 300 cc while Mr E needed 2 drops in 100 cc 13ight drops in 100 cc made it very objectionable to U8 but he said it was like some perfumes and it took 23 to 25 drops to pro duce an objectionably strong sensation We ne2rt tested the sense of taste A preliminary survey served to show that the sense was present and presumably in a normal degree To complete the test we compared his taste with ours for sugar acetic acid and quinine We found about the same measure of sensitiveness for Mr E and for us and found nothing differing from the normal in any respect We proceeded to investigate those mixtures of smells and tastes which make up most of the sensations obtained during eating We took the ordinary flavoring syrups of commerce lemon vanilla currant orange strawbexry and raspberry From all these Mr E obtained only a general sweetish sen sation with no distinction between them except from the lemon which was in the main distinguished by the misture of sweet and sour Ee could in part tell them by their different degrees of sweetness but when presented in proportions in which they seemed to us equally sweet all distinctions were zmpossible to him The tests showed as many wrong as right answers It so happened that some of these substances fermented and these he could at once detect as different from the others and also the more fermented ones from the less so A series of candies with some of the above flavors yielded aorrohorating results It should be understood that all these substances were tasted Next a series of spices was tried with the following results Mustard a sharp sensation on the end of the tougue not recognized Pepper same efEect but stronger Cee not recognized a slight taste Ctnnamon recognized sweet and sharp vroma swee  Ctoves recognized taste distinct but nof describable Thyme sharp bitter something like cloves Tec6 no effect at a11410 JASTROW Antse sharp bitter unpleasant Caraway Seed mild sweetish and salt GHnger not recognized burns Mustard Seed burns decidedly Cttron recognized by its feeling on the tongue sweet In brief some were recognized by secondary qllalities but those that we recognize by flavor were not differentiated A separate series was tried witll tea and coffee and one with ginger and cloves Neither of either p3ir was distinguished frons the other the latter were both called sharp but with no distinction between them Wealso tested BIr Es temperature sense at about 15 30 and 60 B At all these points his sensibility was as good as ours differences of 1 being everywhere recognized The test was made by taking a mouthful of water heated to the required temperature and then throwing it out The great importance of these observations lies in the analysis they enable us to make of the comples of sensations obtained in the mouth and nose In Mr Es case taste is normal the temperature sense is normal the tactile sensi bility is present though as far as irritants are concerned to a diminished extent  while smell alone is absent Accordingly we may conclude that sucll distinctions as Mr E fails to make are in llS dlle to the sense of smell and such as he makes are due to other senses The 2esults conclustrety show that a great many of the mouthsensattons chich we ordtn aity syea7c of as tastes are reatty due to smett The distinc tions between tea and coSee between all the various flavors that make the difference between candies and sugar between various syrups and so on all these are lost That the absence of marked sensations during eating should lead to a relative neglect of such sensations is natural Mr E is per haps on this account less sensitive to other mouth sensations SIr Es defect was observed by members of his family as soon as the sense of smell could be tested IIe has no recol lection of ever having smelled alld his family agree that he never gave evidence of such sensation It is certain that he could not smell when a very small boy He gets no sensa tions froln flowers perceives no difference in the taste of his food when afflicted with a cold and observes no distinctions in the various kinds of sweet things of which he is fond IIe perceives no distinction between tea coffee and hot water flavored with milk and sugar and has come to take the latter as his everyday drink Mr Es case is especially interesting because his mother has a similar defect Mrs E however at one time possessed the sense of smell and distinctly remembers the sensations411 STUDIES FROM UNIVERSITY OF WISOONSIN derived from odors and her use of odorous substances She seems to tlave lost the sense when about 13 or 14 years of age It is definitely established that she is the first and only one of her family or her husbands family to show this defect She has two sons and two daughters besides Mr 3 all of whom are normal as regards the sense of smell Some of the more typical experiments performed upon Mr E were also tried by Mr3 B with strongly corroborative results Am monia alone had a marked effect the same confusions were made by Mrs E as by her son She is likewise deficient in distinguishing  by taste  between flavoring extracts and similar substances CLASSIFICATION TIME With the assistance of GEORGE TV MOOREHOUSE Fellow in Psy chology and MILDRED HARPER An extremsely frequent and important mental process con sists in the reference of some item of knowledge to some familiar class The assimilation of knowledge involves the appreciation of the relation of the new fact to the general body of acquired knowledge In order to maintain in an orderly and accessible fors our mental acquisitions it is nec essary to view each item of information as belonging to such and such classes Psychologists have variously analyzed this process some express their views by picturing the mind as possessing a number of apperceptive instruments and using now one and now another of these according to the nature of the object to be assimilated or again as a series of lanterns each of which has its own focus and field of illumination lIowever we may view the process it is clearly essential to the acquisition of knowledge and it is strange that the study of the timerelations of this process has been hitherto so largely overlooked The present contribution considers the time of a special form of such classification As a distiIletive and readily studied form of such reaction we selected the reference of a common word to its gramrnati cal class We further limited the problem by selecting the fol lowing ten nouns ten verbs and ten adjectives and confining our reactions to calling the proper part of speech to which one of these words belonged house cat book ship ant sun lake doll man girl push have cut mis go die look sit jump touch tough wet good blue low bad high thin hot black These words were chosen as familiar distinctive and mono sylabic representatives of their classes The full list of words which he might be called upon to classify was always read to the subject before each kind of experiment We reacted to a412 JASTROW spoken word by a spoken word The apparatus by which this was accomplshed consisted of a bit of wood held between the teeth connected with one arm of a lever the other arm of which bore a metallic point for electrical contact A spring connectd with the lever tended to pull the bit from between the teeth and according to the adjustment to make or break an electric circuit Both subject and observer used an instu ment of this kind the instruments being so connected with the cllronosedpe that the release of the bit from the mouth of the observer started and a similar action from the subject stopped it The necessary act of separating the teeth that accompanies articulation is here taken as the point of measure ment The apparatus is fairly satisfactry and so long as the results are used mainly for relative purposes the error in volved in its llse may be neglected A perfect apparatus whereby the utterance of a word will start or stop a chrono scope is still a desideratum The entire process may be viewed as consisting of the fol lowing steps 1 the hearing of the sound uttered 2 the recognition of the word 3 the reference of the word to its class 4 the summoning of the term describing that class 5 the muscular innervation accompanying the utterance of the term In order to determine the time of the purely men tal process involved in e2rpressing the fact that a certain one of ten words is a noun or verb or adjective it was necessary to measure separately the time of the mechanical steps The simple reaction involved evidently consists of steps 1 and 5 This time for each of the three subjects we found to be 190 195 and 199 respectively It is naturally somewhat long for a simple reaction because the muscular contractions by which it is signalled that the impression has been received are complicated and because the moment at which the chrono scope starts may slightly precede that at which the sound wave reaches the subjects tympanum In all these simple reactions both observer and subject used what seemed to be the easiest vocalutterance it consisted of a violent expira tiont the result resembling the sound eh We further need iM order to measure step 3 in which we are particularly interested a process involving steps 2 and 4 as well as the simple reaction It seemed impossible X devise any simple process of the kind but the process of repeating a word sufficiently approximates it for our present purpose This process clearly involves in addition to the simple reaction the recognition of a word and the summoning and utterance of a word The only question would be whether the summoning of a term denoting a grammatical class is of equal difficulty with the repetition of a recognized word butSTUDIES FROM UNIVERSITY OF WISCoNSIN 413 as both are very familiar and somewhat mechanical processes their time relations can hardly be very different The repeti tion time for the three subjects was as follows 367 280 333ff The experiments in which words were referred to grammati cal classes were of the following kinds 1 the subject was to tell whether the word was a noun or verb 2 the same distinction regarding nouns and adjectives t 3 the same distinction regarding verbs and adjectives 4 the same dis tinction regarding nouns verbs and adjectives Experimellts are grouped in sets of twenty each In fact from 22 to 25 ob servations were taken and those most divergent from the average of all were discarded until 20 were left A new average of these 20 was entered The following table gives for each of the three subjects the average time of the several reactions together with the number of sets of which it is the average t  s  A i z   z e J J 190

Combining the results of the three observers we obtaill as the result the fact that with a reaction time of 195 and a repetition time of 327 it kes 603 to determine whether one of a set of words belongs to one or the other of two grammati cal classes the mental portion of this process consuming 276ff and that it takes 645 to refer a word to one of three gramTnatical classes It hardly seemed worth while to calculate the mean varia tion of ffiese observations but to satisfy ourselves regarding the regularity of the results we calculated it for the three most typical sets under each kind of reaction Expressing414 JASTsOW the mean variation for these three sets as a percentage of the general average time for the kind of reaction we obtain the following table  e  04we  W t  C c  MYX 5 J J

markedly in the case of M L lI and to some estent in the case of G W M the sariation for the simple reaction is large This is clearly due to the fact that experimentation began with the simple reaction alone so that this sariation indicates absence of practice in reaction work The results are however effected by inequalities of practice This is particularly true of the time for Noun VerbAdjective distinctions which observations were made last and were therefore most benefitted by the practice gained in the former distinctions It is probable therefore that the difference in time 42 between the two processes is too small This appears more clearly in considering the re sults for each subject For J J who began with most prac tice in this kind of observation and whose time for the three classes of distinction NounVerb  Noun A djective and VerbAdjective show greatest constancy the diiierence in question is largest 71ff For G W M who began with some practice in reaction e2periments the difference is inter mediate 43G and would be greater were it not for the special and temporary difficulty he encountered in distinguishing verbs from adjectives the difference between the average of the NounVerb and NounAdjective and the 4NounVerb Adjective being likewise 71ff While for M L E who began with no practice and showed steadily decreasing time for each successive kind of reaction attempted the difference in question is but 12ff It is probable then that the time415 STUDIES FROM UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN for J J 71a is a more typical result than the general aver age 42a The relative difficulty of the three pairs of distinctions NounVerb NounAdjective and VerbAdjective proba bly varies with different individuals in the present study it is also affected by differences of practice on the whole how ever our results favor the view that the three are of practi cally equal difflculty The increase in time in passing from two distinctions to three is an interesting illustration of the effect of the mental attitude on reaction times The process involved is the same in both cases to decide for example that nan is a noun but this decision requires more time when the word in question may belong to one of three grammatical elasses than when it may belong to one of only two Our results indicate that all of these processes are quite complicated and that their timerelations depend upon the accessibility of very familiar items of knowledge Regarding possible differences between the several words they may vary with individllals extended results would be needed to clearly show theil existence It is interesting however to observe that taking the average reaction of each word in all the three kinds in which it occurs we find among nouns ship was most

difficul ties of recognition alld pronunciation FINDINGTIME  With tbe assistaxlce of VINIFRED SERCOMBE and LUCY M CHURCHILL MRS FRAN K T BALDWIN  We have employed the term  findingtime  to denote the time occupied in the process of finding a given object within a given field we recognize with what different facility and rapidity different persons perform such tasks and even in the same individual the time is subject to sariation We have all e2rperienced the difEculty of finding an object even when it is plainly in sight and have wondered at the long time necessary to find a quotation in a volume and the like In this process we carry with us a mental picture of the object sought and we react when the subjective corresponds to the objective picture The ability to recognize one of a number of objects as the one desired is certainly a useful trait and416 J A STROW may perhaps be a convenient test of mental alertness It is this process that we desired to study and to measure The difficulty of finding an object varies with several factors the most important of which may be thus summarized 1 the number of objects amongst which one is sought 2 the nature of the object 3 the minuteness or complexity of the differences by which the one object is distinguished from the others 4 the degree of probability which may amount to certainty that the object sought is within the given area In our study the objects sought were the letters of the alphabet the method of finding them was as follows The letters plain capitals about 4 dioptrics or in the average 65 mm square and very closely conforming to the Snellen types were gummed on a card which was in turn fastened on a block and were seen through square openings in a black screen These openings 25 in number were 11 mm square and were each separated by 195 mm above and below and to each side from the neighboring opening this screen was laid on a glass plate mQanted in a square frame that slipped over the block and inside was about 15 mm larger each way than the block The block contained four alphabets distrib uted by a chance arrangement and according as the frame was moved to the upper left hand the upper right hand the lower right hand or the lower left hand corner one or an other of these alphabets was seen through the openings in the screen The arrangement may be made clear by reference to the letters below Eere each different kind of type repre sents an alphabet and it will be clear from this how a simple movement was sufficient to bring to view through the openings in the screen another alphabet In the original all the letters are of course alike and distributed by a chance arrangement Connected with the frame by means of two iron uprights was C S X O R L T M O T F I R C o G 4 R e H

stereoscope against which the subject rested his head and through two openings in which he viewed the letters Across these openings is a hard rubber lap which may be quickly withdrawn by bring ing into action a strong spring As this flap opens it closes an electric circuit and thus starts the chronoscope 1 An observation was conducted as follows the frame is set for a certain alphabet the operator announces the letter to be found this also serves as a signal and shortly there after he pulls a cord releasing the spring and allowing the subject a view of the letters As soon as the desired letter is seen the subject presses a key and stops the chronoscope To test whether the subject knows where the letter is situated he keeps a record of each answer The positions were indicated by lettering the double rows A B a D E and the columns 1 2 3 4 5 so that Al would indicate the upper lefthand corner D5 the lower right hand corner and C3 the centre letter n the first experiments 25 letters were thus shown Q was omitted but this could be reduced to a foursquare 16 letters by covering over either the row A or iE together with either column 1 or 5 Throughout the experiments es cept

see that it took on the average 569 to find one of 25 letters and 381 to find one of 16 letters The process is thus quite complicated and is very difficult at first the stage of initial practice being quite marked and the first few sets yielding very long times Considerable of this time is con sumed in the process of accommodating the eyes to the plane of the letters and bringing them clearly into vies We coll sidered that this time would be measured by measuring the time needed to see what letter occupied a certain position amongst the twentyfive Instead of calling a letter and react ing when its position was seen a position was called for example A1 C3 etc and the subject reacted when the letter occupying that position was recognized The subject here knows just where to look and although this time includes the recognition of the letter as well we should remember that it is probably fair to exclude this element from the time of find ing letters the finding time strictly applying only to the process of search While therefore only an approsimate elimination of the mechanical process is obtained by sub tracting the  placing time  as we shall call this latter step from the  findingtime yet this diflerence very fairly represents the distinctive part of the finding process and is remarkably alike in the three subjects 273a 275 and 285ff The effect of the number of objects amongst which one is to be sought and of the larger field is illustrated in the difference of time between finding one out of 16 and one out of 25 letters this is on the average 188 and in the individuals 169a 183 and 212ff The ratio of the times to find one out of 25 and one out of 16 letters thus increases in the proportion of 155 to l which is just the ratio of 25 to 16 In placing a letter that is in recognizing what letter occupies a certain position it is obvious that the time should be little if at all affected by the number of places and the slight difference between the values found for placing one of 16 or one of 25 letters 260a and 291 is probably due to the fact that the former sets represent a more advanced stage of practice than the latter The nest variation presents an interesting difference 16 letters are present and as before these change with every ob servation but instead of calling only for those letters that are present any one of the 25 letters may becalled for and if not present the subject reacts as soon as he is convinced of its absence The average result of all the experiments per formed in this manner is 775ff this however is not as signif icant as the result we obtain by considering separately those eases in which the letter to be found was present and those419 STUDIES FROM UNIVERSITY O WISCONSIN cases in which it was absent That it should take longer to go through a series of 16 letters and determine that a certain one is absent than to determine its presence is to be expected the difference is certainly great whether we compare it with the finding time of ond of 25 letters or more properly with the find ing time of one of 16 letters It takes 571 longer or 2l2 times as long to determine that a given letter is not among a group of 16 than to find it if it is present But while it takes 381 to find one of 16 letters when the subject knows it is there it takes 693 to perform precisely the same process when there is a chance strictly when there are 36 chances in a 100 that the letter he is seeking may be absent This result most strikingly illustrates the effect of the foreknowledge of the subject upon the time of mental processes the apparently simple process of comparing an objective with a subjective image varies its character according to the underlyirlg con nection by which the process is accompanied This result too appears in the fact that while in finding letters all of which are known to be present an error is exceedingly rare when the letters may be absent Errors are quite nutnerous and consist in declaring a letter that is present to be absent In certain processes it is relatively easier and quicker to do two things together than to perform them separatelv this being due to an overlapping of the mental processes There is a divi sion of the attention among the several mental tasks so that the time needed for the whole is considerably less than the sum of the times needed to do each separately In other cases the attempt to perform processes together seems to result in a mutual inhibition or confusion and a loss of time and energy As a small contribution to an investigation of this problem we determined in two subjects how long it takes to find two letters among 25 and to note their positions The two letters were announced beforehand and as soon as both were found the subject reacted This proved to be a very difficult and often confusing process it took on the average 1640 which for the two persons under consideration is 418 longer than twice the time needed to find one letter This may serve as an indes of the loss of energy in attempting to have two pro cesses before the mind simllltaneously While our results are not sufficiently numerous or free from greaS variation to warrant detailed inferences yet there are two such questions of detail the importance of which justifies even the mention of the imperfect information we are able to give The first relates to the difference in ease in recognizing the various letters That such differences occur has been shown by more suitable methods Our results show considerable varialtion for one subject the range is from393 for W to 557a for T for another from 487a for S to 719 for L On the whole the three letters most quickly found were 8 O and W and the four least quickly found L J H and T If we ventured to divide the alphabet into three groups of easy medium and difficult letters our lists would read t S O W X D CD 2 I 2 X B Z G M Y A R B 3 E IJ F V T E J L It must be remem bered however that no great weight is to be placed in this detailed result The second question involves the query whether the letters nearer the centre of the block are more readily found than those away from the centre Our results are unfortunately not recorded in such form as to readily allow of the determination of this point but we compared the times for all the letters found in positions B3 D3 C2 and C4 that is in a diamond about the central letter C3 with those for finding the four positions furthest removed from the centre A 1 A 5 iEDI E5 Our result showed a slight excess of time for finding the peripheral letters an excess too slight perhaps to be recorded were it not for its constancy in all three individuals This first atempt to gain a deeper insight into the mental process of finding certainly leaves untouched the larger number of important and suggestive queries attached to it and yet the results obtained are sufficiently clear and con sistent to justify the promise of future investigation SOME A NTHROPO1WETRIC AND PSYCHOLOGIa TESTS ON COL LEGE STUDENTSA PRELIMIN A RY SURVEY With the assistance of GEORGE OREHOUSE Fellow in Psychology During the fall of 1890 it was decided to ask the students in the general class in Psychology to lend themselves to series of physical and psychological tests with a view of interesting the students in such tests as well as acquiring a body of statistical material which when sufficiently estended and properly compared with other statistics might prove of considerable value The experiments were not estensive in character but they served to bring out the difflculties in this line of work and the publication of the present fragmentary results t is ventured in the hopes of furthering similar observations elsewhere The tables given below require more or less explanation and comment The physical measurements of the men are in the 1 Simple and few as the tests were they required about 50 minutes for each student If the tests could be arranged so that several persons might be tested together without interference a great saving of time would result 420 JASTROWSTUDIES FBOM UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN 421 main those regarded a most important by Mr GSalton and were made with the intention of correlating mental with phys ical characteristics The apparatus employed was very simple and hardly needs description The dynamometer is of the Fere pattern made by Cullin Paris Similar measure ments for the women were obtained through the courtesy of Miss Ballard in charge of the Ladies Gymnasium but were too few in number to warrant tabulation In four case the measurements made by Mr Galton upon miscellaneous Englishmen are exactly repeated upon these college students and the results indicate in so far as such few results can indicate a superiority in favor of the college students The sensibility tests were selected to quickly yield a few typical results Like all such observations the chief difficalty lies in the fact that the subjects are not used to accurately ob serving their sensations so that a relatively brief practice would in many cases alter the result The sthesiometer em ployed was that described in this JOURNAL Vol I p 552 It appears that the distance at which two points could be felt as two on the back of the hand was 164 mm and on the finger tip 163 mm the former result being strikingly small as compared with Webers tables The sensitiveness of the palm was tested by determining the minimum height from which the fall of a bit of cardboard could be perceived These bits of cardboard weighed 9 mgr and were cut in rectangles of 1 by 2 mm from a sheet of millimeter paper pasted upon the cardboard The apparatus used for testing the pressure sense was a modification of Fairbanks postofflce balance in which the weights were placed upon the scale pan thus eserting an upward pressure upon the finger resting upon a cushioned plate at the end of the beam A comfortable and firm posi tion was secured and an attachment provided by which fatigue was prevented Twosevenths of the weight on the scale pan acted upon the finger The table records that additional weight to the nearest 25 gr  which could be correctly dis tinguished about 3 or 4 times from an initial weight of 500 gr But few observations were taken and the result is only approsimate The general result is that a difference of about T or 7 of the initial weight may be correctly appreciated We also attempted to measure sensitiveness to pain For this purpose we used a light hammer weight 983 gr  pivoted at aj point 200 mm from the center of its iron head and allowed it to fajll on the tip of the forefinger of each hand The back of the hajnd ajs well ajs the finger struck wajs supported The table records the minimum number of degreesthrough which the hammer must fall in order to caiuse a pain ful sensation While this is naturallynot a clearly defined point still its constancy wais surprising The left hand aip pears to be more sensitive tha the right A s few falls of the hammer as possible should be used in this test as the skin raipidly fatigues We take up nest ai description of the tests of vision The printed page was first placed beyond the subjects vision then gradually moved toward him along a sliding scale until he could just read it The column of the table gives the distaince at which with the maximum strain the page could be read The size of the type is that in which this article is printed The same page was then held as close to the eye as possible and yet have the subjet able to read it We next record the smallest size of print in dioptrics that could be read at 25 feet For the next test we prepared a large white disc with small black sectors ranging from 1 to 15 aind proceeding by half degrees up to 5 When this was rotated there appeared a series of concentric rings of various light shades of gray each ring being 10 mm wide and separated by 5 mm from its neighbors The subject counted as many concentric rings as he could see and the result was then read off in degrees The acuteness of vision was tested in several ways A by finding the distance at which ai series of black lines 1 mm wide and separated by spaces of 1 mm could be recognized and the spaces between the lines clearly discerned B by ai similar determination with a checkerboard pattern both black and white squares being 4 mm square and C by the dis tance at which either 7 or 8 11 or 12 and 15 or 16 dots 2 mm in diameter and irreguialXly arranged in a rectangle of 25x40 mm could be counted The results are recorded in inches Our next test related to color and we attempted a the same time to detect any color defects and to get some measurement of the rapidity and accuracy of color distinctions Each student was required to match as rapidly as possible 30 colored ovals of a BIagnusJefiries Color Shart as published by Prang We also noted irregularities in matching The average time shows about si2r seconds for each color The strength of vision we tested by noting the smallest size of letter readable at 25 ft through one and through two thick nesses of common cheesecloth No student could see the letters at all up to 50 dioptrics through three thicknesses The result is recorded in dioptrics l  The only test for hearing that we attempted was to determine from what height a shot we7ghing 10 mgnm must be dropped upon a glass plate to have the sound lleard bythe subject at a distance of 25 ft The 422 JASTROW423 STUDIES FROM UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN We also made a few tests of the rapidity of movement This was done by arranging two keys so that the closure of the one would start a Hipp Chronoscope and of the other would stop it The distance between the keys was in the one case 38 inches and in the other case 3 inches With the keys 38 inches apart the subject was first told to touch them in suceession not as fast as possible but at any rate which seemed natural to him He next made a movement of the same extent as well as one of 3 inches as fast as possible This was done separately for the right and left hands and the average time of about 5 movements is recorded in the table The movement must be somewhat accurate in order that the key shal be struck at each end The results for the masimum movements enables us to deter mine that the movement alone was at the rate of about 8 feet per second It had been our intention to meet each student a second time and with this intention we inaugurated a series of tests of sensejudgment only a very small portion of which was completed namely those relating to pressure and one relating to the space sense of the skin The subJectwas first required to pour as much shot in the palm of his right hand as he thought would weight an ounce The average weight of the shot thus estimated to weigh an ounce was 37 gm or an exaggeration of 13  men 47 gm an exagger ation 65 women 22 gm an underestimation of 21 IIe was next asked to pour as much shot into a box 3is31x4 in made of  in pine as he thought necessary to have shot and boxweigh one ounce In this case the average result was 97 gm or an exaggeration of 242 men 100 gm exaggeration 252 women 925 gm exaggeration 226 The illusion involved in this test is the well known fact that a stimulus spread over a larger area seems much less intense than a like stimulus confined to a more limited area The result in the two cases given above measures the degree of the illusion IIe next repeated the operation with the inten tion of making the bo2r and shot weigh one pound The average restllt was 548 gm an esaggeration of 28qf0 men 605 gm an exaggeration of 34 women 463 an exaggeration of 2 We find here a smaller percentage of esaggeration than in case of the ounce Ee was then given the bos which he regarded as one pound and irrespective of its actual weight was asked to put enough shot into another box to make it average result 278 mm is inaccurate owing to the impossibily of secur ing absolute and constant quiet It is interesting to note that the hear inE of the women was more acute than that of the men the results bemg 17 and 3B mm respectively 6424 JASTROW weigh double the first The average result was 879 gr or an underestimation of 20 men 940 gr underestimation 23  women 789 gr underestimation 15    The spacetest consisted simply in spreading the points of the aesthesiometer on the back of the subjects hand until he regarded the distance between the points to be one inch The average result was 306 mm an esaggeration of 20 men 31 mm  exaggeration 22  women 30 mm  exaggera tion 18  It is interesting to note that in all these tests of sense judgment the women are more correct than the men In addition to this a few tests on bilateral symmetry of motion were made upon 17 of the ladr students They were asked to move the forefingers of the two hands outward from a common point along horizontal bars of a wooden cross the intention being to move the two arms to an equal distance The movementls were first made wvith the fingers at all points resting Oll the bar and were further subdivided into fast movements and slow movements and again into large move ments and small movements All these variations were also gone through with for movements in which the fingers were lifted up into the air and brought down upon the bar at the end of the movement free movements The table shows the result from each of tElese variations It appears that in each case the right hand malKes the larger movement the excess on the average amounting to 155 mm Regarding the estent of the excess of the prefea red hand it is necessary to note that one student is markedly lefthanded and another nearly ambidextrous In both these cases the left hand makes the larger excursions and thus the average excess of the preferred hand becomes 167 mm or 2 Of an inch It appears that the most influential of the distinctions made is that between the guided and the free movements the average excess of the preferred harld in the case of the guided movements being 101 mm and in free movements 234 mm The size of the movement is of some influence upon this excess it being on the average 213 mm for the large move ments and 121 mm for small movements In slow move ment the excess of the preferred hand is more marked than in fast movements being 199 mm in the former and 135 in the latter Individuals show considerable difference in the amount of tlhis excess of the preferred hand the average excess for the 17 different individuals being as follows 543 307 30S 25l 226 206 176 170 128 126 109 107 left 99 90 80 80 left and 39 mm In addition to the measurements given above we placed before them a series of miscellaneous questions in regard to425 STUDIES FllOM UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN personal and family characteristics From the answers to these questions we collect the following data the average age was 21 yrs It mo 31 men 22 yrs 4 mo 22 women 21 yrs 4 mo

free from a11 such 13 9 men and 4 women were troubled with headache and 7 with other complaints 46 of 52 students 27 men and 19 women called their sleep regular and the rest irregular and 33 of 46 students 23 men and 10 women spoke of their sleep as sound and the rest as  light The average duration of sleep was just 8 hours It will be interesting to compare as far as possible the records of the men with those of the women The general result regarding dermal sensations is that womell have finer sensibility than men This is true for each one of the tests made but the diflerences are comparatively slight except for the absolute sensitiveness of the palm and the sensitiveness to pain The greater sensitiveness in women in both of these cases indicates freedom from rough usage As regards vision the differences on the whole are so small as to prove no superiority in the one case or in the other To this there is but one exception and that is in the accuracy and rapidity of color perception in which the women are clearly better than the men Finally regarding the rate of movement the normal move ments that is those adopted when no special direction is given are quicker in women than men while the masimum movements particularly in case of the longer movements are faster in men All these differences are consistently related to well recognized differences in the two se2res regarding the use and development of the different sensesTABLE I Physical Measurements of 31 Men in mm Height Height Span of Chest lIead Strength Standing Seat of ahair Arms Girtll Girth of Squeeze

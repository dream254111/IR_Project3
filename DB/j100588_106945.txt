1795 SIR Naples August z2th iy94 EVERY day produces some new publication relative to the late tremendous eruption of mount Vesuvius so that the va rious phenomena that attended it will be found on record in either one or other of these publications and are not in that danger of being passed over and forgotten as they were for merly when the study of natural history was either totally neglected or treated of in a manner very unworthy of the great Author of nature I am sorry to say that even solate as in the accounts of the earthquakes in Calabria in 1783 printed at Naples nature is taxed with being malevolent and bent upon destruction In a printed account of another great eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 1631 by ANTONIO SANTORtLL1 doctor of medicine and professor of natural philosophy in the university of Naples and at the head of the fourth chapter of his book are these words Se questo incendio sia opera de dee monii Whether this eruption be lthe work of devils The account of an eruption of Vesuvius in 1737 published at Naples by Doctor SERAO is of a very different cast and does great ho nour to his memory All great eruptions of volcanoes must MDCCXCV 74 Sir WILLIAM HAMILTONs Account of naturally produce nearly the same phenomena and in SERAO5 book almost all the phameomena we have been witness to dur ing the late eruption of Vesuvius are there admirably de scribed and well accounted for The classical accounts of the eruption of Vesuvius which destroyed the towns of Hercu lanleum and Pompeii and many of the existing printed ac counts of its great eruption in 1631 although the latter are mixed with puerilities might pass for ali account of the late eruption by only changing the date and omitting that circum stance of the retreat of the sea from the coast which happened in both those great eruptions and not in this and I might content myself by referring to those accounts and assuring you at the same time that the late eruption after those two appears to have been the most violent recorded by history and infinitely more alarming than either the eruption of 1767 or that of 1779 of both of which I had the honour of giving a particular account to the Royal Society Howvever I think it my duty rather to hazard being guilty of repetition than to nreglect the giving you every satisfaction in my power relative to the late formidable operation of nature You know Sir thatfwith the kind assistance of the Father ANTONIO PIAGGI of the order of the Scole Pie who has re sided many years at Resina on the very foot of Mount Vesu vius and in the full view of it I am in possession of an exact diary of that volcano from the year 1779 to this day and which is also accompanied with drawings It is plain from some remarks in that diary previous to this eruption that a great one was expected and that we were apprehensive of the mischief that might probably attend the failling in of the cra ter which had been much contracted within these two yearsthe late Eruption of Mount Vesuviu 7 past by the great emission of scoriax and ashesi from time to time and which had alsoincreased the height of the volcano and nearly filled up its crater Tlie frequent slight eruptions of lava for some years past have issued from near the sumimit and ran in small channels in differentl directionis down the flanks of the mountain and from running in covered chaii nels had often an appearance as if they came immediately out of the sides of Vesuvius but such lavas had not sufficient force to reach the cultivated parts atthe foot of the mountain  In the year 1779 the whole quantity of the lava in fusion having been at once thrown up with violence out of the crater of Vesuvius and a great part of it falling and cooling on its cone added much to the solidity of the walls of this huge natural chimney if I may be allowed so to call it and has not of late years allowed of a sufficient discharge of lava to calm that fermentation which by the subterraneous noises heard at times and by the explosions of scorin and ashes was known to exist within the bowels of the volcano so that the eruptions of late years before this last have as I have said been simply from the lava having boiled over the crater the sides being sufficiently strong to confine it and oblige it to rise and overflow The mountain had been remarkably quiet for seven months before its late eruption nor did the usual smoke issue from its crater but at times it emitted small clouds of smoke that floated in the air in the shape of little trees It was remarked by the Father ANTONIO DI PETRIZZI acapuchin friar who has printed an account of the late eruption from his convent close to the unfortunate town of Torre del Greco that for some days preceding this eruption a thick vapour was seen to surround the mountain about a quarter of a mile L  276 Sir WILLIAM HAMILTONS Account of beneath its crater as it was remarkedby him and others att the same time that both the sun and the moon had often am unusual reddish cast The water of the great fountain at Torre del Greco began todecrease some days before the eruption so that the wheels of a cornmill worked by that water moved very slowly it was necessary in all the other wells of the town and its neigh bourhood to lengthen the ropes daily in order to reach at the water and some of te wells became quite dry Althoughl most of the inhabitants were sensible of this phlenomenon not one of them seems to have suspected the true cause of it It has been well attested that eight days before the eruption a man and two boys being in a vineyard above Torre del Grecol and precisely on the spot where one of the new mouths opened from whence the principal current of lava that de stroyed the town issuled were much alarmed by a sudden puff of smoke that came out of the earth close to therm and was attended with a slight explosion Had this circumstance with that of the subterraneousnoises beards at Resina for two days before the eruption with the ad ditional one of the decrease of water in the wells as above mniomned been communicated at the time it ould have required nogreat foresight to have been certain that an erup tion of the volcano was near at hand and that its force was directed particularly towards that part of the mountain On the 12th of June in the imorning there was a violent f1al of rain and soon after the inhabitants of Resina situated direct over the ancient town of Herculaneum were sensible of a rumbling subterraneous noise which was not heard at Naplesthe late Eruption of Mount Vesuvius 77 From the month of January to the month of May last the atmosphere was generally calm andd we had continued dry weather In the month of May we had a little rain but the weather was unusually sultry For somne days preceding the eruption the Duke DELLA TORRE a learned and ingenious noblemans of this country and who has published two letters upon the subject of the late eruption observed by his electro meters that the atmosphere was charged in excess with the electric fluid and continued so for several days during the eruption there are many other curious observations in the dukes account of the late eruption About ii oclock at night of the 12th of June at Naples we were all sensible of a violent shock of an earthquake atheun dulatory motion was evidently from east to west and appeared to me to have lasted near half a minute The sky which had been quite clear was soon after covered with black clouds The inhabitants of the towns and villages which are very nu merous at the foot of Vesuvius felt this earthquake still more sensibly and say that the shock at first was from the bottom upwards after which followed the undulation fromr east to west This earthquake extended all over the Campagna Fe lice  and their Sicilian Majesties were pleased to tell me that the royal palace at Caserta which is 15 miles from this city and one of the most magnificent and solid buildings in Europe the walls being i8 feet thick was shook in such a manner as to cause great alarm and that all the chamber bells rang It was likewise much felt at Beneventum about 3o miles from Naples  and at Ariano in Puglia which is at a much greater distance both these towns have been often afflicted with earthquakes78 Sir WiLLIAM HAMILToNS Account of  On sunday the i5th of June soonkafter ic clock at night another shock of an earthquake was felt at Naples but did not appear to be quite so violent as that of the 12th nor did it last so long at the same moment a fountain of bright fire at tended with a very blkck smoke and a loud report was seen to issue and rise to a great height from about the middle of the cone of Vesuvius soon after another of the same kind broke Iout at some little distance lower down then as I suppose by the blovwing up of a covered channel full of redhot lava it had the appearance as if the lava had taken its course directly up the steeppcone of the volcano Fresh fountains succeeded one another hastilyand all in a direct line tending for about a wmile and a half downf towards the towns of Resina and Torre del Greco I could count 15 of them but I believe there were sothers obscured by the smoke It seems probable that all these fountains of fire from their being in such an exact lin proteeded from One and the Same long fissure down the flanks Of the mOuntain and that the lava and other volcanic matter forced its way out of the widest parts of the crack and formed there the little mountains and craters that will be described in their proper place It is imPossible that any description can give an idea of this fiery scene or of the hOrrid noises that attended this great operation of nature It was a mixture of the loudest thunder with incessant reports like those from a qlmimerous heavy artillery accompanied by a continued hollow murmur like that of he f the ocean during a violent storm and added to these was 4nother blowing noise like that of the going up of a large flight of skyrockets and which brought to my mind also that noise which is produced by the action of the enormous bellows on the furnace of the Carronte late Eruption of Mount VesuviuS 79 iron foundery in Scotland and which it perfectly resembled The frequent fallingof the huge stones and scoriae whichwere thrown up to an incredible height from some of the new mouths and one of which having been si nce measured by the Abbe eTATA who has published an account of this eruption wsgas 10 feet high and  in fcircumference contributed un doubtedly to the concussion of the earthl and afir which kept all the houses at Naples for several hours in a constant tre mor every door and window shaking and rattling inces santly and the bells ringing This was an awful moment The sky fromp a bright full moon and starlight began to be obscured the mobn had presently the appeararice of being in an eclipse and soon after was totally lost in obscurity The murmur of the prayers and lamentations of a numerous popi lace forming various processions and parading in the streets added likewise to the horror As the lava did not appear to me to have yet a sufficient vent and it was now evident that the earthquakes we had already felt had beenr occasioned by the air and fiery matter confined within the bowels of theb mountain and probably at no small depth considering the extentof those earthquakes I recommended to the com pany that was with me who began to be much alarmed ra ther to go and view the mountain at some greater distance and in the open air than to remain in the house which was on the sea side and in the part of Naples that is nearest and most exposed to Vesuvius We accordingly went to Posilipo5 and viewed the conflagration now become still more consi  derable from the sea side under that mountain but whether from the eruption having increased or from the loud reports of the volcanic explosions being repeated by the mountain8o Sir WILLIAM HAMILTONS Account of behind us the noise was much louder and more alarming Dthan that we had heard in our first position at least a mile tearer to Vesuvius After some time and which was about two oclock in the morning of the 1itth having observed that the lavas ran in abundance freely and with great velocity having made a considerable progress towards Resinla the town which it first treatened and that the fiery vapours which had been confined had now free vent through many parts of a crack of more than a mile and a half in length as was evident from the quantity of inflamed matter and black smoke which continued to issue from the new mouths abovementioned with out any interruption I concluded that at Naples all danger from earthquakes which had been my greatest apprehension was now totally removed and we returned to our former station at S Lucia at Naples All this time there was not the smallest appearance of tire or smoke from the crater on the summit of Vesuvius but the black smoke and ashes issuing continually from so many new mouths or craters formed an enormous and dense body of clouds over the whole mountain and which began to give signs of being replete with the electric fluid by exribiting flashes of that sort of zigzag lightning which in the vol canic language of this country is called ferilli and which is the constant attendant on the most violent eruptions From what I have read and seen it appears to me that the truest judgment that can be formed of the degree of force of the fermentation within the bowels of a volcano during its erup tion would be fromn observing the size and the greater or less elevation of those piles of smoky clouds which rise out of the craters and form a gigantic mass over it usually in thethe late Eruption qf Mount Vesuvius form of a pine tree and from the greater or less quantity of theferilli or voicanic electricity with which those clouds ap pear to be charged During thirty years that I have resided at Naples awnd in which space of time I have been witness to manyeruptionsof Vesuvius of one sort or other I never saw the gigantic cloud abovementioned replete with the electric fire except in the two great eruptions of 1767 that of 1779 and during this more formidable one The electric fire in the year 1779 that played constantly within the enormous black cloud over the crater of Vesuvius and seldom quitted it was exactly similar to that which is produced on a very small scale by the con ductor of an electrical machine communicating with an insu lated plate of glass thinly spread over with metallic filings cC when the electric matter continues to play over it in zig zag lines without quitting it I was not sensible of any noise attending that operation in 779  whereas the discharge of the electrical matter from the volcanic clouds during this erup tion and particularly the second and third days caused explo sions like those of the loudest thunder  and indeed the storms raised evidently by the sole power of the volcano resembled in every respect all other thunderstorms the lightning falling and destroying every thing in its course The house of the Marquis of BERIo at S Iorio situated at the foot of Vesuvius during one of these volcanic storms was struck with lightning which having shattered many doors and windows and damaged the furniture left for some time a strong smell of sulphur in the rooms it passed through Out of these gi gantic and volcanic clouds besides the lightning both during this eruption and that of 179 I have with many others MDccGcV MSir WILLIAM HAMILTONS Account of seen balls of fire issue and some of a considerable mag nitude which bursting in the air produced nearly the same effect as that from the airballoons in fireworks the electric fire that came out having the appearance of the serpents with which those firework balloons are often filled The day on Which Naples was in the greatest danger from the volcanic clouds two small balls of fire joined together by a small link like a chainshot fell close to my casino at Posilipo they separated and one fell in the vineyard above the house and the other in the sea so close to it that I heard a splashin the water but as I was writing I lost the sight of this phxno menon which was seen by some of the company with me and related to me as above The Abb6 TATA in his printed ac count of this eruption mentions an enormous ball of this kind which flew out of the crater of Vesuvius whilst he was stand ing on the edge of it and which burst in the air at some dis tance from the mountain soon after which he heard a noise likethe fall of a number of stones or of a heavy shower of hail During the eruption of the i5th at night few of the inha bitants of Naples from the dread of earthquakes ventured to go to their beds The common people were either employed in devout processions in the streets or were sleeping on the quays and open places the nobility and gentry having caused their horses to be taken from their carriages slept in them in the squares and open places or on the high roads just out of the town For several days whilst the volcanic storms of thunder and lightning lasted the inhabitants at the foot of the volcano both on the sea side and the Somma side were often sensible of a tremor in the earth as well as of the concussions3the late Eruption of Mount Vesuvius 83 in the air but at Naples only the earthquakes of the 12th and Ith of June were distinctly and universally felt this fair city could not certainly have resisted long had not those earth quakes been fortunately of a short duration Throughout this eruption which continued in force about ten days the fever of the mountain as has been remarked in former eruptions shewed itself to be in some measure periodical and generally was most violent at the break of day at noon and at mid night About four oclock in the morning of the 1ith the crater of Vesuvius began to shew signs of being open by some black smoke issuing out of it and at daybreak another smoke tinged with red issuing from an opening near the crater but on the other side of the mountains and facing the town of Ottaiano shewed that a new mouth had opened there and fromn which as we heard afterwards a considerable stream of lava issued and ran with great velocity through a wood which it burnt  and hlaving run about three miles in a few hours it stopped before it had arrived at the vineyards and cultivated lands The crater and all the conical part of Vesuvius was soon in volved in clouds and darkness and so it remained for several days  but above these clouds although of a great height we could often discern fresh columns of smoke from the crater rising furiously still higher until the whole mass remained in the usual form of a pine tree and in that gigantic mass of heavy clouds theferilli or volcanic lightning was frequently visible even in the day time About five oclock in the morn ing of the i6th we could plainly perceive that the lava which had first broke out from the several new mouths on the south M84 Sir WILLIAM HAMILTONS ACCount of side of the mountain had reached the sea and was running into it having overwhelmed burnt and destroyed the greatest part of Torre del Greco the principal stream of lava having taken its course through the very centre of the town We ob served from Naples that when the lava was in the vineyards in its way to the town there issued often and in different parts of it a bright pale flame and very diffirentrfrom the deep red of the lava this was occasioned by the burning of the trees that supported the vines Soon after the beginning of this Eruption ashes fell thick at the foot of the mountain all the way from Portici to the Torre del Greco and what is remark able although there were not at that time any clouds in the air except thoe of smoke from the mountain the ashes were wet and accormpanied with large drops of water which as It have been well assured were to the taste very salt the road which is paved was as wet as if there had been a heavy shower of rain Those ashes were black and coarse like the sand of the sea shore whereas those that fell there and at Naples some days after were of a lightgrey colour and as fine as Spanish snuff or powdered bark They contained many saline particles as I observed when I went to the town of Torre del Greco on the i7th of June that those ashes that lay on the ground exposed to the burning sun had a coat of the whitest powder on their surface which to the 0taste was extremely salt and pungent In the printed account of the late eruption by EMANUEL SCOTT I dotortof physic and pro fessor of philosophy in the university of Naples he supposes which appears to be highly probable that the water which accompanied the fall of the ashesat the beginningi of the eruptthe late Eruption of Mount Vesuvius tion was produced by the mixture of the inflammable and de phlogisticated air according to experinents made by Doctor PRIESTLEY and Monsieur LAVOISIER By the time that the lava had reached the sea between five and six oclock in the morning of the i6th Vesuvius was so com pletely involved in darkness that we could no more discern the violent operation of nature that was going on there and so it remained for several days but the dreadftil noise wve heard at times and the red tinge on the clouds over the top of the mountain were evident signs of the activity of the fire under neath The lava ran but slowly at Torre del Greco after it had reached the sea and on the 17th of June in the morn ing when I went inl my boat to visit that unfortunate town its course was stopped excepting that at times a little rivulet of liquid fire issued from under the smoking scoria into the sea and caused a hissing noise and a white vapour smoke at other times a quantity of large scoring were pushed off the surface of the body of the lava into the sea discovering that it was red hot under that surface and even to this day the centre of the thickest part of the lava that covers the townre tains its red heat The breadth of the lava that ran into the sea and has formed a new promontory there after having de stroyed the greatest part of the town of Torre del Greco having been exactly measured by the Duke DELLA TORRE is ofEnglish feet 12c4 Its height above the sea is 1 2 feet and as many feet under water so that its whole height is 24 feet it extends into the sea 626 feet I observed that the sea water was boiling as in a cauldron where it washed the foot of this new formed promontory and although I was at least an hun dred yards from it observing that the sea smoked near my86 aSir WILLIAM HAMILTONS  Accounto boat I put mny hand into the water which was literally scalded and by this timr e my boatmen observed that the pitch from the bottom of the boat was melting fast and floating on the surface of the sea and that the boat began to leak we therefore retired hastily from this spot and landed at some dis tanrce from the hot lava The town of Torre del Greco con ta i ed about it30ao inh bitants all of which exept about Ad ho Vrom either age for ini rmity could not be moved and were overwhelmed by the lava in their houses escaped either to Castelamare which was the ancient Stabioe or to Naples but the rapid progress of the lava was such after it had al tered its course from Resina which town it first threatened and had joined a fresh lava that issued from one of the new mouths in a vineyard about a mile from the town that it ran like a torrent over the towvn of Torre del Greco allowing the unfortunate inhabitants scarcely time to save their lives their goods and effects were totally abandoned and indeed several of the  inhabitants whose houses had been surrounded with lava whilst they remained in  themn escaped from them and saved their lives the following day by coming out of the tops of their houses and walking over the scorix on the surface of the red hot lava Five or six old nuns were taken out of a convent in this manner oa the i6th of June and carried over the hot lava as Ias informed by the friar who assisted them andt who told me that their stupidity was such as not tohave been the least alarmed or sensible of their danger he f  d one of upwards of go years of age actually warming herself at a point of ridhot lava which touched the windowv of her cell and which she said weas very comfortable and though now apprized of their danger they were still very unwilling to leavethe late Eruption of Mount Vesuvius 87 the convent in which they had been shut up almost from their infancy their ideasbeing as limited as the space they in habited Having desired them to pack up whatever they had that was most valuable they all loaded themnselves with bis cuits and seetmeats and it was bat by acidentthatC the friar discovered that they had left a sum of money behind them which he recovered for them and these nuns are now in a convent at Naples At the time I landed atTorre del Greco on the 17th I found some few of its inhabitants returned and aendeavouring to recover their effects from such houses as had not been thrown down or were not totally buried under the lava but alas what wasthir cruel disappointment when they found that their houses had been already hvoke open and com pletely gutted of every thing that was valuable and I saw a scuffle at the door of one house between the proprietors and the robbers who had taken possession of it The lava had passedover the centre and best part of the tovn no part of the cathedral remainedabove it except the upper part of a square brick tower in which are the bells and it is a cuiious circu nastance that those bells although they are neither cracked or melted are deprivedof their tone as much as if tfl y had been cracked I suppose by the action of the acid andt vitriolic vapcurs o 0 the lava Some of the inhabitants of Torre del Greco told me that when the lava first entered the sea it thrown up the water to a prodigious height and particularly when two points of lava met and inclosed a pool of water that then that water was thrown up with great violence and a loud report they likewise told me that at this time as well as the day after a great many boiled fish were seen floating88 Sir WILLIAM HAMILTONS Account of on the surface of the sea and I have since been assured by many of the fishermen of Portici Torre del Greco and Torre dell Annunziata all of which towns are situated at the foot of Vesuvius that they could not for many days during the eruption catch a fish within two miles of that coast which they had evidently deserted When this lava is cooled sufficiently which may not be uin til some months hence I shall be curious to examine whether the centre or solid and compact parts of the lava that ran into the sea has taken as it probably may the prismatical form of basalt columns like many other ancient lavas disgorged into the water The exterior of this lava at present like all others offers to the aeye nothing but a confused heap of loose scoria The lava over the cathedral and in other parts of the town is upwards of 40 feet in thickness the general height of the lava during its whole course is about 12 feet and in some parts not less than a mile in breadth I walked in the few remaining streets of the town and I went on the top of one of the highest houses that was still standing although sur rounded by the lava I saw from thence distinctly the whole course of the lava that covered the best part of the town the tops of the houses were just visible here and there in some parts sand the timbers within still burning caused a bright flame to issue out of the surface in other parts the sulphur and salts exhaled in a white smoke from the lava forming a white or yellow crust on the scorix round the spots where it issued with the most force Often I heard little explosions and saw that they blew up like little mines fragments of the scoria and ashes into the air I suppose them to have been occasioned eitherby rarefied air in confined cellars or perhapsthe late Eruption of Mount Vesuvius 89 by small portions of gunpowder taking fire as few in this country are without a gun and some little portion of gun powder in their houses As the church feasts are here usually attended with fireworks and crackers a fireworkmaker of this town had a very great quantity of fireworks ready made for an approaching feast and some gunpowder all of which had been shut up in his house by the lava a part of which had even entered one of the rooms yet he actually saved all his fireworks and gunpowder some days after by carrying them safely over the hot lava I should not have been so much at my ease had I known of this gunpowder and of several other barrels that were at the same time in the cellar of another house inclosed by the lava and which were afterwards brought off on womens heads little thinking of their danger over the scoriae of the lava that was redhot underneath The heat in the streets of the town at this time was so great as to raise the quicksilver of my thermometer to very near ico degrees and close to the hot lava it rose much higher but what drove me from this melancholy spot was that one of the robbers with a great pig on his shoulders pursued by the proprietor with a long gun pointed at him kept dodging round me to save him self I bid him throw down the pig and run which he did and the proprietor satisfied with having recovered his loss ac quainted me with my danger by telling me that there were now thieves in every house that was left standing I thought it therefore high time to retire both for my own safety and that I might endeavour to procure from Naples some protection for the doubly unfortunate sufferers of this unhappy town Ac cordingly I returned to Naples in my boat and immediately acquainted this government with what I had just seen myself i wccxcvV Ngo Sir WILLIAM HAMILTONS Account of in consequence of which a body of soldiers was seht directly to their relief by sea the road by land having been cut off by the lava I remarked in my way home that there was a much greater quantity of the petroleum floating on the surface of the sea and diffusing a very strong and offensive smell than was usual for at all times in calms patches of this bituminous oil called here petroleum are to be seen floating on the surface of the sea between Portici and Naples and particularly opposite a village called Pietra Bianca The minute ashes continued falling all this day at Naples the mountain totally obscured by them continued to alarm us with repeated loud explosions  the streets of this city were this day and the next constantly filled with religious and penitential processions composed of all classes and nothing was heard in the midst of darkness but the thunder of the mountain and ora pro nobs The sea wind increasing at times delivered us from these ashes which it scattered over different parts of the Campagna Felice On Wednesday the 18th the wind having for a very short space of time cleared away the thick cloud from the top of Vesuvius we discovered that a great part of its crater particu larly on the west side opposite Naples had fallen in which it probably did about four oclock in the morning of this day as a violent shock of an earthquake was felt at that moment at Resina and other parts situated at the foot of the volcana The clouds of smoke mixed with the ashes which as I have before remarked were as fine as Spanish snuff so much so that the impression of a seal with my coat of arms would re malin distinctly marked upon them were of such a density as to appear to have the greatest difficulty in forcing their pas sagelout of the nQw widely extended mouth of Vesuvius whichfbe late Erufption 0f Mount Vesuvius 91 certainly since the top fell in cannot be much short of two miles in circumference One cloud heaped on another and succeeding one another incessantly formed in a few hours such a gigantic and elevated column of the darkest hue over the mountain as seemed to threaten Naples with immediate de struction having at one time been bent over the city and apm pearing to be much too massive and ponderous to remain long suspended in the air it was besides replete with the ferilli or volcanic lightning which was stronger thaii common light ning just as PLINY the younger describes it in one of his letters to TACITUS when he says fulgoribus ille et simles et majores erant Vesuvius was at this time completely covered as were all the old black lavas with a thick coat of these fine lightgrey ashes already fallen which gave it a cold and horrid appear ance and in comparison of the abovementioned enormous mass of clouds which certainly however it may contradict our idea of the extension of our atmosphere rose many miles above the mountain it appeared like a molehill although as you know Sir the perpendicular height of Vesuvius from the level of the sea is more than three thousand six hundred feet The Abbe BRACCINI as appears in his printed account of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 1631 measured with a quadrant the elevation of a mass of clouds of the same nature that was formed over Vesuvius during that great erupm tion and found it to exceed thirty miles in height Doctor SCOTTI in his printed account of this eruption says that the height of this threatening cloud of smoke and ashes measured but he does not say how from Naples was found to be of an elevation of thirty degrees All I can say is that to my eye N292 Sir WILLIAM HAMILTONS Account of the distance from the crater of Vesuvius to the most elevated part of the cloud appeared to me nearly the same as that of the island of Caprea from Naples and which is about 25 miles but I am well aware of the inaccuracy of such a sort of mea surement At the time of its greatest elevation I engaged Signor GATTA successor to the late ingenious Mr FABRIS to make an exact drawing of it which he did with great suc cess and a copy of that drawing on a small scale is inclosed Tab VII and will I hope give you a very good idea of what I have been describing I must own that at that moment I did apprehend Naples to be in some danger of being buried under the ashes of the volcano just as the towns of Herculaneum and Pompeii were in the year 79 The ashes that fell then at Pompeii were of the same fine quality as those from this eruption having often observed when present at the excavations of that ancient city that the ashes which I suppose to have been mixed with water at the same time had taken the ex act impression or mould of whatever they had inclosed so thatthe compartments of the wood work of the windows and doors of the houses remained impressed on this volcanic tufo although the wood itself had long decayed and not an atom of it was to be seen except when the wood had been burnt and then you found the charcoal Having once been present at the discovery of a skeleton in the great street of Pompeii of a person who had been shut up by the ashes during the eruption of 79 I engaged the men that were digging to take off the piece of hardened tufo that covered the head with great care and as in a mould just taken off in plaster of Paris we found the impression of the eyes that were shut of thethe late Eruption of Mount Vesuvius 93 nose mouth and of every feature perfectly distinct A similar specimen of a mould of this kind brought from Pompeii is now in his Sicilian Majestys museum at Portici it had been formed over the breast of a young woman that had been shut up in the volcanic matter every fold of a thin drapery that covered her breast is exactly represented in this mould and in the volcanic tufo that filled the ancient theatre of Hercu laneum the exact mould or impression of the face of a marble bust is still to be seen the bust or statue having been long since removed  Having observed these fine ashes issuing in such abundance from Vesuvius and having the appearance of being damp or wet as you may perceive by the drawing Tab VII that they do not take such beautiful forms and volutes as a fine dry smoke usually does but appear in harsh and stiff little curls you will not wonder then that the fate of HIercu laneum and Pompeii should have come again strongly into my mind  but fortunately the wind sprung up fresh from the sea and the threatening cloud bent gradually from us over the mountain of Somma and involved all that part of the Cam pagna in obscurity and danger To avoid prolixity and repetition I need only say that the storms of thunder and lightning attended at times with heavy falls of rain and ashes causing the most destructive torrents of water and glutinous mud mixed with huge stones and trees torn up by the roots continued more or less to afflict the inhabitants on both sides of the volcano until the 7th of July when the last torrent destroyed many hundred acres of cultivated land between the towns of Torre del Greco and Torre dell Annunziata Some of these torrents as I have been credibly assured by eye witnesses both on the94 Sir WILLIAM HAMILTSOS Account of sea side and the Somma side of thy mountain came down with a horrid rushing noise and some of them after hav ing forced their way through the narrow gullies of the moun tain rose to the height of more than 20 fret and were near half a mile in extent The mud of which the torrents were composed being a kind of natural mortar has completely cased up and ruined for the present sQme thousand acres of rich vineyards for it soon becomes so hard that nothing less than a pickaxe can break it up I say for the present as I imagine that hereafter the soil may be greatly improved by the quantity of saline particles that the ashes fro m this eruption evidently contain A gentleman of the British fac tory at Naples having filled a plate with the ashes that had fallen on his balcony during the eruption and sowed some pease in them assured me that they came up the third day and that they continue to grow much faster than is usual in the best common garden soil My curiosity or rather my wish to gratify that of ouri re spectable Society induced me to go upon Mount Vesuvius as sooh as I thought I might do it with any degree of prudence which was not luntil the 3ath of June and then it was attended Wvith some risk as will appear in the course of this narrative The crater of Vesuvius except at short intervals had beeti continually obscured by the volcanic clouds ever since the 16th and was so this day with frequent flashes of lightning playing in those clouds and attended as usual with a noise like thunder and the fine ashes were still falling on Vesuyius but still more on the mountain of Somma I went up the usual way by Resina attended by my old Cicerone of the mountain BARTOLOMEO Pubao with wh m I have beenthe late Eruption of Mount Vesuvius sixtyeight times on the highest point of Veuvius I observed in my way through the village of Resiha that many of the stones of the pavement had been loosened and were deranged by the earthquakes particularly by that of the i8th which attended the falling iti of the crater of the volcano and which as they told hti there had been so violent us to throw many people down aind obliged all the inhabitants of Resina to quit their houses hastily and to which they did not dare return for two days The leaves of all the vihes were burnt by the ashes that had fallen on them and Many of the vines thenrielves were buried under the ashes and great branches of the trees that supported them had been torn off by their weight In short nothing but ruin and desolation was to be seen The ashes at the foot of the mountain were about Io or 12 inches thick on the surface of the earth but in proportion as we as cended their thickness increased to several feet I dare say not less than 9 or lo in some parts so that the surface of the old rugged lavas that before was almost impracticable was now become a perfect plain over which we walked with the greatest ease The ashes were of a lightgrey colour and ex ceedingly fine so that by the footsteps being marked on thein as on snoW we learnt that three small parties had been up be fore us We saw likewise the track of a fox that appeared to have been quite bewildered to judge from the many turns he had made Even the traces of lizards and other little animals and of insects were visible on these fine ashes We ascended to the spot front whence the lava of the i5th first issued and we followed the course of it which was still very hot although covered with such a thick coat of ashes quite down to the sea at Torne del Greco which is more than five miles A pair96 Sir WILLIAM HAMILTONS Account of of boots to which I had for the purpose added a new and thick sole were burnt through on this expedition It was not possible to get up to the great crater of Vesuvius nor had any one yet attempted it The horrid chasms that exist from the spot where the late eruption first took place in a straight line for near two miles towards the sea cannot be imagined They formed vallies more than two hundred feet deep and from half to a mile wide and where the fountains of fiery matter existed during the eruption are little mountains with deep craters Ten thousand men in as many years could not surely snake such an alteration on the face of Vesuvius as has been made by nature in the short space of five hours Except the exhalations of sulphureous and vitriolic vapours which broke out from different spots of the line abovementioned and tinged the surface of the ashes and scoriae in those parts with either a deep or pale yellow with a reddish ochre colour or a bright white and in some parts with a deep green and azure blue so that the whole together had the effect of an iris all around us had the appearance of a sandy desert We went on the top of seven of the most considerable of the newformed mountains and looked into their craters which on some of them appeared to be little short of half a mile in circumfe0 rence  and although the exterior perpendicular height of any of them did not exceed two hundred feet the depth of their inverted cone within was three times as great It would not have been possible for us to have breathed on these new moun tains near their craters if we had not taken the precaution of tying a doubled handkerchief over our mouths and nostrils and even with that precaution we could not resist long the fumes of the vitriolic acid were so exceedingly penetrating and oftAe late Eruption of Mount suviUS 97 such a suffocating qualityg We found in one a double crater like two funnels joined toetherand Jin all there wts some little smokes anddepositions of salts and sulphurs of the va rious colours above mentioned just as is commonly seen ad h ering to the inner walls of the principal crater of Vesuvius Two or three days after we had been here one ofthe new rmouths into which wee had looked suddenly made a great explosion of stones smoke and ashes which would certainly have proved fatal to any one who might unfortunately have been there at the time of thee explosion We read of a like acci dent having proved fatal to more than twenty peoplewho had the curiosity to look into the crater of the Monte Nuovo near Pozzuoli a few days after its formation in the year i58 The i5th of August 1 saw a sudden explosion of smoke and ashes thrown to an extreme height out of the great crater of Vesu vius that must have destroyed any one within half a mile of it and yet on the i9th of July a party not only had visited that crater but haddescended 7 feet within it Whilst we were on the mountain two whirlwinds exactly like those that form waterspouts at sea made their appearance and one of them that was verynear us made a strange rushing noise and having taken up a great quantity of the fine ashes formied them into an elevated spiral column which with a whirling motion and great rapidity was carried towards the mountain of Somma where it broke and wasdispersed As there were evident signs of an abundance of electricity in the air at this time I have no doubt of this having been also an electrical operation One of my servants employed in collecting of sul phur or sal amnmoniac which crystallizes near the fumaroli as they are called here and which are the spots from whence Hujccxcv QV98 Sir WILLIAM HAMILTON S Account of the hot vapour issues out of the fresh lavas found to his great surprise an exceeding cola wind issue from a fissure very near the hotfumaroli abovementioned upon his leg I put my hand to the spot and found the same but it did not surprise me as before on Mount Vesuvius on the mountain of Somma onI Mount Etna and in the island of Ischia I had met witb on particular spots the like currents of extreme cold air issuing from beneath the ancient lavas and which being constant to those spots are known by the name of ventoroli In a vine yard not in the same line with the newformed mountainsjust described but in a right line from them at the distance of little more than a mile from Torre del Greco are three or four more of these newformed mountains with craters out of which the lava flowed and by uniting with the streams that came from the higher mouths and adding to their heat and fluidity enabled the whole current to make so rapid a pro gress over the unfortunate town as scarcely to allow its inha bitants sufficient time to escape with their lives The rich vineyards belonging to the Torre del Greco and which pro duced the good wine called Lacrima Christi that have been buried and are totally destroyed by this lava consisted as I have been informed of more than three thousand acres but the destruction of the vineyards by the torrents of mud and water at the foot of the mountain of Somma is much more extensive I visited that part of the cpu ntry also a few days after I had been on Vesuvius not being willing to relate to you any one circumstance of the late formidable eruption but what I had reason to believe was founded on truth The first signsof a torrent that I met with was near the village of the Madonnathe late Eruption qf Mount Vesuvius S dell Arco and Ipassed several others between that and the town of Ottaiano the one near Trochia and two near the town of Somma were the most considerable and not less than a quarter of a mile in breadth and as several eye witnesses assured me on the spot were when they poured down from the mountain of Somma from o0 to 3o feet high it was a liquid glutinous mud composed of scoriap ashes stones some of which of an enormous size mixed with trees that had been torn up by the roots Such torrents as you may well imaW gine were irresistible and carried all before them  houses walls trees and as they told me not less than four thousand sheep and other cattle had been swept off by the several tor rents on that side of the mountain At Somma they likewise told me that a team of eight oxen that were drawing a large timber tree had been carried off from thence and never were more heard of The appearance of these torrents when I saw them was like that of all other torrents in mountainous countries except that what had been mud was become a perfect cement on which nothing less than a pickaxe could make any impression The vineyards and cultivated lands were here much more ruined and the limbs of the trees much more torn by the weight of the ashes than those which I have already de scribed on the sea side of the volcano The Abbe TATA in his printed account of this eruption has given a good idea of the abundance the great weight and glutinous quality of these ashes when he says that having taken a branch from a figtree still standing near the town of Somma on which were only six leaves and two little unripe figs and having weighed it with the ashes attached to it he 0 2100 Sir WILLIAM HAMILTONS Account of found it to be 31 ounces when having washed off the Volca nic matter it scarcely weighed 3 ounces I saw several houses on the road in my way to the town of Somma with their roofs beaten in by the weight of the ashes In the town of Somma I found four churches and about se venty houses without roofs and full of ashes The great da mage on this side of the mountain by the fall of the ashes and the torrents happened on the i8th l9th and 2oth of June and on the 12th of July I heard but of three lives that had been lost at Somma by the fall of a house The l9th the ashes fell so thick at Somma as they told me there that un less a person kept in motion he was soon fixed to the ground by them This fall of ashes was accompanied also with loud reports and frequent flashes of the volcanic lightning so that surrounded by so many horrors it was impossible for the inhabitants to remain in the town and they all fled the darkness was such although it was midday that even with the help of torches it was scarcely possible to keep in the high road in short what they described to me was exactly what PLINY the younger and his mother had experienced at Mi senum during the eruption of Vesuvius in the reign of TITUS according to his second letter to TACITUS on that subject I found that the majority of people here were convinced that the torrents of mud and water that had done themso much mis chief came out of the crater of Vesuvius and that it was sea water but there cannot be any doubt of those floods having been occasioned by the sudden dissolution of watery clouds mixed with ashes the air perhaps having been t6o much rare fied to support them and when such clouds broke and fell heavily on Vesuvius the water not being able to penetratethe late Eruptionof Mount Vesuvius 104 as usual into the pores of the earth which were then filled up with the fine ashes of a bituminous and oily quality nor hav ing free access to the channels which usually carried it off ac cumulated in pools and mixing with more ashes rose to a great height and at length forced itsway through new chanle nels and came down in torrents over countries where it was least expected and spread itself over the fertile lands at the foot of the mountain From what I have seen lately I begin to doubt very much if the water by which so much damage was done and so many lives were lost during the terrible eruption of Vesuvius in 1631 did really as was generally supposed come out of the crater of the volcano sentiments were divided then as they are now on that subject and since in all great eruptions the crater of the volcano must be obscured by the clouds of ashes as it probably was then and certainly was during the violence of the late eruption therefore it must be very difficult to ascertain exactly from whence that water came The more extraordinary a circumstance is the more it appears to be the common desire that it should be credited from this principle one of his Sicilian Majestys gardeners of Portici went up to the crater of Vesuvius as soon as it was practicable and came down in a great fright declaring that he had seen it full of boiling water The Chevalier MACEDONIO intendant of Portici judged very properly that to put an end to the alarm this report had spread over the country it was neces sary to send up people he could trust and on whose veracity he might depend Accordingly the next day which was the t6th of July Signor GuISEPPE SACCo went up well attended and proved the gardeners assertion to be absolutely false there being only sorme little signs of mud from a deposition of theSir WILLIAM HAMILTONS Account of rain water at the bottom of the crater According to SACCOS account which has been printed at Naples the crater is of an irregular oval form and as he supposes not having been able to measure it of about a mile and an half in circumference by my eye I should judge it to be more the inside as usual in the shape of an inverted cone the inner walls of which on the eastern side are perpendicular but on the western side of the crater which is much lower the descent was practicable and SACCO with some of his companions actually went down 176 palms from which spot having lowered a cord with a stone tied to it they found the whole depth of the crater to be about eoo palms But such observations on the crater of Vesuvius are of little consequence as both its form and apparent depth ame subject to great alterations from day to day These cu rious observers certainly ran some risk at that time since which such a quantity of scorie and ashes have been thrown up from the crater and even so lately as the i5th of this month as must have proved fatal to any one within their reach The 22d of July one of the new craters which is the nearest to the town of Torre del Greco threw up both fire and smoke which circumstance added to that of the lavas re taining its heat much longer than usual seems to indicate that there riay still be some fermentation under that part of the volcano The lava in cooling often cracks and causes a loud explosion just as the ice does in the Glaciers in Switzerland such reports are frequently heard now at the Torre del Greco and as some of the inhabitants told me they often see a va pour issue from the body of the lava and taking fire in 4ir fall like those meteors vulgarly called falling starsthe late Eruption of Mount Vesuvius 103 The darkness occasioned by the fall of the ashes in the Campagna Felice extended itself and varied accordingto the prevailing winds On the i9th of June it was so dark at Caserta which is 15 miles from Naples as to oblige the in habitants to light candles at midday Vand one day during the eruption the darkness spread over Beneventum which is 3o miles from Vesuvius The Archbishop of Taranto in a letter to Naples and dated from that city the i8th of June said We are involved in a thick cloud of minute volcanic ashes and we imagine that there must be a great eruption either of Mount Etna or of  Stromboli The bishop did not dream of their having pro ceeded from Vesuvius which is about 250 miles from Taranto We have had accounts also of the fall of the ashes during the late eruption at the very extremityof the province of Lecce which is still farther off and we have been assured likewise that those clouds wererepletewith electrical matter at Martino nearTa ranto a house was strick and much damaged by the lightning from one of these clouds In the accounts of the great erup tion of Vesuvius in 1631 mention is made of the extensive progress of the ashes from Vesuvius and of the damage done by the ferilli or volcanic lightning which attended them in their course I must here mention a very extraordinary circumstance ill deed that happened near Sienna in the Tuscan state about i8 hours after the commencement of the late eruption of Vesu vius on the i5th of June although that pharnomenon may have no relation to the eruption and which was communicated to me in the following words by the Earl of Bristol bishop of Derry in a letter dated from Sienna July 12th  1794  Int04 eSr WILLIAM4HAMILTONs Account of the midst of a most violent thunderstorm about a dozen stones of varibus weights and dimensions fell at the feet of different people men women and children the stones are of a quality not found in any part of the Siennese territory they fell about i8 hours after the enormous eruption of Ve  suvius which circumstance leaves a choice of difficulties in the solution of this extraordinary phaenomenon either these stones have been generated in this igneous mass of clouds which produced such unusual thunder or which is equally incredible they were thrown from Vesuvius at a distance of at least 250 miles judge then of its parabola The philoso phers here incline to the first solution I wish much Sir to  know your sentiments My first objection was to the fact  itself but of this there are so many eye witnesses it seems impossible to withstand their evidence and now I am re duced to a perfect scepticism His lordship was pleased to send me a piece of one of the largest stones which when en tire weighed upwards of five pounds I have seen another that has been sent to Naples entire and weighs about one pound The outside of every stone that has been found and has been ascertained to have fallen from the cloud near Sienna Hi evidently freshly vitrified and is black having every sign if having passed through an extreme heat when broken the inside is of a lightgrey colour mixed with black spots and some shining particles which the learned here have decided to be pyrites and therefore it cannot be a lava or they would have been decomposed Stones of thesame nature at least as ar as the eye can judge of them are frequently found on Mount Vesuvius and when I was on the mountain lately I searched for such stones near the new mouths but as the soilthe late Eruption of Mount Vesuvius ho round them has been covered with a thick bed of firne ashes whatever was thrown up during the fore of the eruption lies buried under those ashes Should we find similar stones with the samevfitrifiedcoat onthem onMount Vesuvius as I told Lord BR iSTOL inmy answer to his letter the question would be decided in favour of Vesuvius unless it could be proved that there had been about the time of the fall of these stones in the Sanese territory some nearer opening of the earth at tended with an emission cif volcanic matter which might very well be as the mountain of Radicofani within 50 miles of Sienna is certainly volcanic I mentioned to his lordship ano ther idea that struck me As we have proofsduring the late eruption of a quantity of ashes of Vesuvius having been car ried to a greater distance than where the stones fell in the Sanese territory might not the same ashes have been carried over the Sanese territory and mixing with a stormy cloud have been collected together just as hailstones are sometimes into lumps of ice in which shape they fall and might not then exterior vitrification of those lumps of accumulatedand hard ened volcanic matter have been occasioned by the action of the electric fluid on them The celebratedl Father AMBRoGIO SOLDANI professor of mathematics in the university of Sienna i printing there his dissertation upon this extraordinary phve nompenon wherein as I have been assured he has decided that those stones were generated in the air independantly of volcanic assistance Until after the 7th of July when the last cloud broke over Vgsuvius and formed a tremendous torrent of mud which took ists course across the great road between Torre del Greco and tlee Torre deli Annunziata and destroyed nany vineyards 4wcxclV P1o6 Sir WILLIAM HAMILTONS Account of the late eruption could not be said to have finished although the force of it was over the 22d of June since which time the crater has been usually visible The power of attraction in mountains is well known but whether the attractive power of a volcanic mountain be greater than that of any other mountain is a question all I can say is that during this last eruption every watery cloud has been evidently attracted by Vesuvius and the sudden dissolution of those clouds has left such marks of their destructive power on the face of the coun try all round the basis of the volcano as will not soon be erased Since the mouth of Vesuvius has been enlarged I have seen a great cloud passing over it and which not only was attracted but was sucked in and disappeared in a moment After every violent eruption of Mount Vesuviuswe read of damage done by a mephitic vapour which coming from under the ancient lavas insinuates itself into low places such as the cellars and wells Qf the houses situated at the foot of the volcano After the eruption of 1767 I remember that there were several instances as in this of people going into their cellars at Portici and other parts of that neighbourhood having been struck down by this vapour and who would have expired if they had not been hastily removed These occasional vapours and which are called here mofete are of the same quality as that perma nent one in the Grotta del Cane near the lake of Agnano and which has been proved to be chiefly fixed air The vapours that in the volcanic language of this country are calledfuma roli are of another nature and issue from spots all over the fresh and hot lavas whilst they are cooling they are sulphu reous and suffocating so much so that often the birds that are flyinfg over them are overpowered and fall down dead ofthe late Eruption of Mount Vesuvius 107 which we have had many examples during this eruption par ticularly of wood pigeons that have been found dead on the lava These vapours deposite a crust of sulphur or salts par ticularly of sal ammoniac on the scoriae of the lava through which they pass and the small crystals of which they are composed are often tinged with a deep or pale yellow with a bright red like cinnabar and sometimes with green or an azure blue Since the late eruption many pieces of the scoriae of the fresh lava have been found powdered with a lucid sub stance exactly like the brightest steel or iron filings The first appearance of the mofete after the late eruption was on the 17th of June when a peasant going with an ass to his vineyard a little above the village of Resina in a narrow bollow way the ass dropped down and seemed to be expiring the peasant was soon sensible of the mephitic vapour himself end well knowing its fatal effects dragged the animal out of its influence and it soon recovered From that time these vapours have greatly increased and extended themselves There are to this day mnany cellars and wells all the way from Portici to Torre dell Annlrnziata greatly affected by them This heavy vapour when exposed to theopen air does not rise much more than a foot above the surface of the earth but when it gets into a confined place like a cellar or well it rises and fills them as any other fluid would do having filled a well it rises above it about a foot high and then bending over falls to the earth on which it spreads always preserving its usual level Wherever this vapour issues a wavering in the air is perceptible like that which is produced by the burning of charco4l and when it issues from a fissure near any plants or vegetables the leaves of those plants are seen to move as if P P1c8 Sir WILLIAM HAMILTONS Account of they were agitated by a gentle wind It is extraordinary that although there does not appear to be any poisonous quaa lity in this vapour which in every respect resembles fixed air it should prove so very fatal to the vineyards some thou sand acres of which have been destroyed by it since the late eruption when it penetrates to the roots of the vines it dries them up and kills the plant A peasant in the neigh bourhood of Resina having suffered by the mefete which destroyed his vineyards in the year 1767 and having ob served then that the vapour followed the laws of all fluids made a narrow deep ditch all round his vineyard which com municated with ancient lavas and also to a deep cavern under one of them the consequence of his well reasoned opera tion has been that although surrounded at present by these nOXiOUS vapOters aid which lie constantly at the bottom of his ditch they have never entered his vineyard and his vines are now in a flourishing state whilst those of his neighbours are perishing Upwards of thirteen hUndred hares and many pheasants and partridges overtaken by this vapour have been found dead within his Sicilian Majestys reserved chases int the neighbourhood of Vesuvius and also many domestic cats who in their pursuit after this game fell victims to the mofete A few days ago a shoal of fish of several hundred weight hav ing been observed by some fishermen at Resina in great agita tion on the surface of the sea near some rocks of an ancient lava that had run into the sea they surrounded them with their nets and took them all with ease and afterwards disco vered that they had been stunned by the mephitic vapour which at that time issued forcibly from underneath the ancient lava into the sea I have been assured by many fishermenthe late Eruption of Mount VesuLvius Iog that during the force of the late eruption the fish had totally abandoned the coast from Portici to the Torre dell Annun ziata and that they could not take one in their nets nearer the shore than two miles The divers there who fish for the an cin which we call sea eggs and other shell fish likewise told me that for the space of a mile from that shore since the erup tion they have found all the fish dead in their shells as they suppose either from the heat of the sand at the bottom of the sea or from poisonous vapours The divers at Naples comn plain of their finding also many of these shell fish or as they are called here in general termsfrutti di mare dead in their shells I thought that these little well attested facts might contri bute to show the great force of the wonderful chemical opera tion of nature that has lately been exhibited here The mjefte or fixed air vapours must certainly have been generated by the action of the vitriolic acid upon the calcareous earth as both abound in Vesuvius The sublimations which are visibly ope rating by the chemistry of nature all along the course of the last lava that ran fromn Vesuviuseqand particularly in and about the new mouths that have been formed by the late eruption on the flanks of the volcano having been analyzed by Signor DoMENIcO TOMAsO an ingenious chemist of Naples and whose experiments and the result of them are now published have been found to be chiefly sal ammoniac mixed with a small quantity of the calx of iron but not to betray my ig norance on this subject and pretending to nothing more than the being an exact ocular observer I refer you to the work itself which accompanies this letter Many hundred weight of the Vesuvian sal ammoniac have been collected on the mountain since the late eruption by the peasants and sold atit o Sir WILLIAM HAMILTONS Account of Naples to the refiners of metals  at first it was sold for about six pence a pound but from its abundance the price is now reduced to half that money and a much greater quantity must have escaped in the air by evaporation The situation of Mount Vesuvius so near a great capital and the facility of approaching it has certainly afforded more opportunities of watching the operations of an active volcano and of making observations upon it than any other volcano on the face of the earth has allowed of The Vesuvian diary which by my care has now been kept with great exactness and without interruption for more than 15 years by the worthy and ingenious Padre ANTONIO PIAGGI as mentioned in the beginning of this letter and which it is my intention to de posite in the library of the Royal Society will also throw a great light upon this curious subject But as there is every reason to believe with SENECA that the seat of the fire that causes these eruptions of volcanoes is by no means superficial but lies deep in the bowels of the earth and where no eye can penetrate it willi I fear be ever much beyond the reach of the limited human understanding to account for them with any degree of accuracy There are modern philosophers who propose with as great confidence the erecting of conductors to prevent the bad effects of earthquakes and volcanoes and who promise themselves the same success as that which has at tended Doctor FRANKLINS conductors of lightning for as they say all proceed from one and the same cause electricity When we reflect how many parts of the earth already inha bited have evidently been thrown up from the bottom of the  cc Non ipse ex sQ est sed in aliqua inferna

there being a much greater portion under the same predicament as yet un explored the vain pretensions of weak mortals to counteract such great operations carried on surely for the wisest purposes by the beneficent Author of nature appear to me to be quite ridiculous Let us then content ourselves with seeing as well as we can what we are permitted to see and reason upon it to the best of our limited understandings well assured that whatever is is right The late sufferers at Torre del Greco although his Sicilian Majesty with his usual clemency offered them a more secure spot to rebuild their town on are obstinately employed in re building it on the late and still smoking lava that covers their former habitations and there does not appear to be any situa tion more exposed to the numerous dangers that must attend the neighbourhood bf an active volcano than that of Torre del Greco It was totally destroyed in 1631 and in the year 737 a dreadful lava ran within a few yards of one of the gates of the town and now over the middle of it nevertheless such is the attachment of the inhabitants to their native spot although attended with such imminent danger that of 18ooo not one gave his vote to abandon it When I was in Calabria during the earthquakes in 1783 I observed in the Calabrese the same attachment to native soil some of the towns that were totally destroyed by the earthquakes and which had been ill situated in every respect and in a bad air were to be rebuilt and yet it required the authority of government to oblige the inhabitants of those ruined towns to change their situation for a much betterSir WILLIAM HAMILTON S Account of Upon the whole having read every account of the former eruptions of Mount Vesuvius I am well convinced that this eruption was by far the most violent that has been recorded after the two great eruptions of 79 and 1631 which were un doubtedly still more violent and destructive The same pha nomena attended the last eruption as the two former above mentioned but on a less scale and without the circumstance of the sea having retired from the coast I remarked more than once whilst I was in my boat an unusual motion in the sea during the late eruption On the 18th of June I observed and so did my boatman that although it wasa perfect calm thbe waves suddenlyrose and dashed against the shore causing a white foam but which subsided in a few minutes On the i5th the night of the great eruption the corks that support the nets of the royal tunny fishery at Portici afd which usually float upon the surface of the sea were suddenly drawn under water and remained so for a short space of time which indi cates that either there must have been at that time a swell in the spa or a depression or sinking of the earth under it From what we have seen lately here and from what we read of former eruptions of Vesuvius and of other active vol canoes their neighbourhood must always be attended with danger with this consideration the very numerous popula tion at the foot of Vesuvius is remarkable From Naples to Castelamare about 15 miles is so thickly spread with houses as to be nearly one continued street and on the Somma side of the volcano the towns and villages are scarcely a mile from one another so that for thirty miles which is the extent of the basis of Mount Vesuvius and Somma the population may be perhaps more numerous than that of any spot of a likethe late Eruption of Mount Vesuvius 113 extent in Europe in spite of the variety of dangers attending such a situation With the help of the drawings that accompany this account of the late eruption of Vesuvius and which I can assure you to be faithful representations of what we have seen I flatter myself I shall have enabled you to have a clear idea of it and I flatter myself also that the communication of such a variety of well attested phxnornena as have attended this formidable eruption may not only prove acceptable but useful to the cu rious in natural history I have the honour to be c WM HAMILTON IN a subsequent letter from Sir WILLIAM HAMILTON to Sir JOSEPH BANKS dated Castelamare anciently Stabic Sept 2 1794 are the two following remarks

by accident falling into a well there that was dry but full of the mephitic vapour was immediately suffocated there were no signs of any hurt from the fall as the well was shallow This cir cumstance called to my mind the death of the elder PLINY who most probably lost his life by the same sort of mephitic vapours on this very spot and which are active after great eruptions of Veesuvius 2 Mr JAMES

Signor XAVERIO GATTA successor to Signor PIETRO FABRIS Tab IX Is a drawing made by the Padre ANTONIO PIAGGI at Resina during the force of ithe eruption of the L5th at night and being within a mile and a half of the mountain shews many particulars that escaped us so much farther off at Naples but he was interrupted by the imminent danger of his situation and his drawing is incomplete it was with diffi culty that his friends carried him off alive being upwards of 80 years old in the midst of a shower of heavy cinders and sulphureous ashes an hour after the beginning of the eruption nor was he able to return to his house for many days T No thing is necessary to be added to his Latin references to the drawing but that Turris VIII is Torre del Greco and Retina now Resina A Montis vertex

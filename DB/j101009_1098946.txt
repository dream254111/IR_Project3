No 8 contains in the two cases of Southern Railway Co v Carnegie Steel Co Limited p 347 and Lacka wanna Iron  Coal Co v Farmers Loan  Trust Co p 363 a valuable exposition of the law as to the preference that claims against the current income of a railroad have over a mortgage debt In the Carnegie Steel Co case a claim for steel rails furnished eleven months prior to the appointment of a receivership over the rail road the rails being necessary to keep the road in running order was given preference over the claims of mortgage creditors The law as to this was settled in the case of Fosdick v Schall 99 U S 235 on grounds so logical and eminently just that its authority is unquestionable But in the present case the time limit of six months the extreme time yet set within which claims must be created in order to acquire this preference is broken in upon for the first time Turner v Indianapolis 8 Biss U S 315 The principle of Fosdick v Schall is that cer tain claims are of such a nature that the creditors look to the current earnings of the road for their payment Current earnings are matters of at least yearly com putation It would seem therefore that the eleven months allowed in the present case is about the limit within which such claims can be created and priority given to them Debts older than this raise at least the presumption that they rely more upon tile general credit of the company for satisfaction than upon the current earnings When such is the case the principles of Fosdick v Schall hardly apply Thomas v Peoria R R 36 Fed 808 The principles to be drawn from the pres ent decisions of the Supreme Court seem to be briefly these In order to give preference to the claims of material men over mortgage creditors 1 such claims must be created within some limited time to be settled by the circumstances of each case 2 they must be against the current earnings of the road not against its general credit 3 they must not be secured by collateral security 4 they must be for such repairs to the road as are required to put it in safe condition and not so extensive as to amount to practical reconstruction 5 they must be for a special kind of material and labor These principles should be kept clearly in mind for some State courts have gone so far as to say that almost every claim of material men against a railroad must be paid before the mortgagee Such a decision is undoubtedly wrong not only being unjust to him who has lent the railroad his money but also giving a greater security to some creditors than they deserve The principle of Fosdick v Schall is undoubtedly good law within the limits that seemed well established prior to this Carnegie Steel Co case and while the change made by this case seems proper and just a limit has now been reached by this decision which it would seem cannot be overstepped with impu nity Yale Law Journal BILLS AND NOTESIMPLIED AUTHORITY TO FILL UP BLANKSMoore v Henshaw 55 N E 236 1899 This was a suit on a note of which one Elwood Moore was the maker The appellant defendant was Moores surety on the note the appellee plaintiff was the payee The note in question was given to June 124satisfy three other notes which Moore was unable to meet All the parties to the instrument including the appellant agreed that the note should bear eight per cent interest but after the note was executed it was discovered that the rate of interest had not been specified Then Moore the maker inserted the figure 8 being requested to do so by the appellee This insertion was made without con sulting the appellant surety but it was apparently in pursuance of the previous agreement to which he was a party The lower court did not believe that under these circumstances the surety had a good defence but he appealed and in the present case the lower court was reversed and judgment given for the appellant The ground of the decision was that there had been material alteration of the note which released the appellant from liability The case does not seem reconcilable with the authorities The court cites a number of cases in support of its decision but upon examination it is found they do not support They are all in affirmance of a proposition which while it is un deniably good law is not applicable to the point in question because prior to the application it presumes a state of facts which is not present here That is that the alteration be made without authority After saying that a material alteration will avoid a note the court says  It is a material alteration to add an nterest clause     and proceeds to cite cases Hart v Oehler 80 Ind 83 1881 held that crossing out the words Interest on this note has been paid to maturity  discharged the defendant upon his previously made contract of indorsement There was no express or implied consent to the alteration In Shalnks v Albert 47 Ind 461 1874 Schwind v Hacket 54 Ind 248 1876 and Brown v Mitchell 79 Ind 84 1881 the facts were the same even as to the rate of interest inserted In each case the holder inserted the words  at 10 per cent int which would seem to be a popular proceeding in Indiana The judges held very unanimously and very properly that this innocent pleasantry upon the part of the holder released the maker from all liability upon his instrument With a pleasant sense of variety we note that in the case of Boustead v Cuyler 116 Pa 551 1887 the rate inserted was six per cent   with interest at six per cent until paid while in Hart v Clouser 30 Ind 210 1868 the holder de cided upon the rate of eight per cent It was decided in both cases that the notes were avoided releasing in the former case the maker in the latter the surety In citing these cases the court apparently lost sight of a great distinguishing feature between them and the case under its consideration i e the previous agreement In no one of the cases cited was there any authority to make the alteration either express or implied But what was done in the present case Moore had authority to do implied from the previous agreement to which the appellant was a party By filling in the blank Moore made the instrument con form to the true intention of all the parties as evidenced by the agreement His right to do this is supported by many cases Without more than mentioning the distinction to be taken between making an alterationin the cases cited inserting an entire interest clauseand merely fill ing in a blankhere inserting the figure 8 in an already existing clause although the distinction by no means unimportant  Vosher v Webster 8 Cal 109 we pass to the consideration of two other cases cited by the court which although open to the same objection as those already mentioned as far as their 1900 125 MISCELLANY126 6 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER June bearing upon the present case is concerned yet deserve more than mere mention because of the suggestion in each of the principle upon which Moore v Henshaw should have been decided In Palmer v Poor 121 Ind 136 1889 the insertion of the figure 8 without the knowledge or consent of the maker was held to be such a material alter ation that no recovery could be had It is quite plain from the opinion of the court that if there had been any such prior agreement as in Moore v Henshaw the decision would have been different Says the court in speaking of the case of 3Iarshall v Drescher 68 Ind 359 and distinguishing it from the case then de ciding      there the circumstances were such as to create the implica tion that the holder of the note had authority to fill the blank left in the instru ment and it was upon this ground that the note there under consideration was held valid Thus clearly showing that if any such implied authority had been present in Palmer v Poor the result would have been different The other case is De Pauw v Bank 126 Ind 553 25 N E 705 1890 There the note was complete in all its terms It was indorsed in blank by the defendant The decision was that the maker had no authority implied from the fact that the indorsement was in blank to agree with the payee that the indorser should be liable as surety How this case supports the decision in Moore v Henshaw it is somewhat difficult to see Indeed in one part of the opinion it is said It is undoubtedly the law that where one    leaves blanks in a note neces sary to be filled    he thereby clothes the holder with implied author ity to fill those blanks There was stated the principle of law which should govern Moore v Henshaw In Herveyv Hervey 15 Maine 357 1839 it was said that the holder of a bill has the right to alter it and correct mistakes if he thereby makes the instrument con form to what all parties to it agreed or intended it should have been McCraven v Chilser 53 Miss 542 1876  Where an alteration iq a promissory note con forms to true intention of the parties and is honestly made  it will not vitiate the note The law will presume assent Duker v Franz 7 Bush 273 1870 Holder of a note may make an alteration to correct a mistake if he make the instrument conform etc See also Fisher v Webster 8 Cal 109 1857 and Cole v Hills 44 N H 227 1862 Connor v Routh 8 Miss 176 1843 The insertion of words and figures which have been left out is no defence This note was payable 24  after date Holder was allowed to insert the word months Ames v Colburn 11 Gray 390 1865 Alteration was made in date of a note which had been antedated This was allowed as making the note con form to the true intention of the parties Boyd v Brotherson 10 Wendell 93 1832 A note was for eight  dollars The holder was allowed to insert  hundred on proof that that was intent of parties Hansom v Hfnsom 41 Ga 303 1869 Maker of a note upon which the defendant was surety in troduced a clause making it payable in gold Whether this invalidated the note was said to depend upon whether such was the original understanding A mere reduction to writing by the principal of what was in fact the agreement of the parties would not be a change of contract See also Clute v Small 17 Wendell 238 Hunt v Adams 6 Mass 519 Am and Eng Enc of Law 1 ed vol 2 p 339 2 ed vol 4 p 153 N 1 Lownes v Freer 4 111 App 547 Parsons on Bills and Notes p 569 Mistakes in a bill or note may be corrected and thealteration will not vitiate    The insertion of either words or figures left out by mistake is no defenceAmerican Law Register LIABILITY OF STREET RAILWAY TO ASSESSMENTS FOR STREET IMPROVE MENTSThere are some important questions by no means yet generally appre ciated respecting the basis and extent of the liability of a street railway company for street improvements In the recent case of Shreveport v Prescott 51 La Ann 1895 46 L R A 193 the court declares that the uniform current of judicial opin ion affirms the principle that the right of occupancy of a portion of the streets of a municipality by a street railway corporation is property which is benefited by a street improvement to the extent of the space occupied by its roadbed and tracks and therefore liable with the property of abutting owners to its proportionate share of the cost and also that the company is bound to pay all the expense for that portion of the work lying between the rails of the tracks and for two feet on each side thereof A note to this case in 46 L R A 193 collates the decisions on this subject They show that the courts have usually sustained the liability of street railways to such assessments But they have by no means clearly defined the principles which govern and limit the liability of the street railway to such assessments The doctrine that local assessments can be sustained only on the basis of special benefits is clearly shown in the note to Re Bonds of Madera Irriga tion District Cal 14 L R A 755 to be sustained by most of the authorities thougn denied by a few But that principle is finally and fully established by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Norwood v Baker 172 U S 269 43 L ed 443 which holds that an assessment not based on benefits is in violation of the Federal Constitution The benefit received by a street railway company from the pavement of a street especially when the cars are operated by electricityseems to be very little On the constitutional basis of benefits it is therefore impossible to hold a street railway company liable for any considerable part of the cost of paving Certainly the assessment must be limited to the actual benefit received by the property from the street improvement however small that benefit may be unless the company is liable for some other reason or on some other basis than that of the ownership of the property in the street The only basis on which street railway companies can be held liablq under the Federal Constitution for a street improvement beyond the amount of benefits which the property of the company receives by reason of the improvement is that of an express or implied contract It may be that by an express provision in the contract under which the company is given a franchise to use the streets it agrees to pay the cost of such improvements It may be that it takes its franchise under statutes which expressly provide for such liability and the provisions of which constitute by implication a part of the franchise contract But unless the com pany is in some way bound by contract to pay the expense of such improvements there seems to be no escape from the conclusion that its liability for them is lim ited to the actual benefit it receives from them however small that may be It is quite possible that some street railway companies may therefore escape the liability to which they ought to be subjected It is unfortunate that the earlier decisions rendered on the subject did not more clearly establish the principles governing the liability in such cases Their failure to do so is doubtless traceable to the 1900 127 MISCELLANY6 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER theory which was long tacitly if not expressly adopted by many courts that property owners must submit to any assessments however arbitrary which local authorities might impose As a result of this serious mistake it is to be feared that many street railway franchises have been given without any provision that will bind them to pay for street improvements and that until these franchises are extinguished such companies will have a substantial exemption from street assess mentsCase and Comment EXCLUSIVE PRIVILEGES GRANTED BY A CARRIERA recent decision in Min nesota involves an important question as to the rights of a common carrier to exploit its passengers for its own profit The defendant a terminal company contracted with the proprietor of a livery stable that he should have the exclusive privilege of soliciting patronage within the station The plaintiff a rival hack man having insisted upon soliciting within the station was ejected by the de fendant It was held that the grant of such an exclusive privilege was lawful Godbout v St Paul Union Depot Co 81 N W Rep 835 Minn By the great weight of authority a railroad company may not allow any par ticular hackman or expressman to occupy a favored portion of its platform to the exclusion of all others who wish to solicit trade on the ground that it is virtually subjecting the traveling public to a monopoly On the other hand it is settled law that a common carrier may lawfully grant exclusive privileges of furnishing refreshments papers and the like within its station and of soliciting patronage upon its trains In regard to such things the railroad is under no obligation to the public and consequently it may sell them out to the highest bidder Con cerning matters necessarily connected with its public employment of transporta tion a carrier may not itself make a profit at the expense of the convenience of its passengers for that is a violation of its duty to the public Clearly it is a part of the duty of a railroadand a terminal company though not a common carrier is under a similar public dutyto furnish its passengers with free ingress and egress to and from its trains Nor can it be said to have provided an unrestricted exit when the most convenient part of the platform is occupied by one favored hack man for a passenger if not forced is at least persuaded to employ that particular one by reason of the greater difficulty attendant upon procuring the services of rival hackmen The traveling public therefore loses its right to the advantage of free competition and is practically subjected to a monopoly Indeed that is the very purpose of the restriction Such a regulation would consequently seem to be unlawful State v Reed 76 Miss 211 McConnell v Pedigo 92 Ky 465 7 Harvard Law Review 494 Of the few cases to the contrary there is but one in a court of last resort Railroad Co v Tripp 147 Mass 35 The English cases on the subject are not applicable as they are governed by the Railway and Traf fic Act In the principal case the court sought to draw a distinction because although one man was given the exclusive privilege of soliciting trade within the station all were allowed the same platform facilities outside therefore it was urged the circumstances were similar to the case of soliciting upon the train Yet this does notseem to be true While upon the train the passenger is under no necessity of providing for further transportation and the carrier owes him no duty in that regard As soon as he reaches the station however this need arises and he hires 128 June1900 MISCELLANY 129 a cab as soon as he sees a cabman without waiting until he reaches the cabs out side of the station Hence the greater facilities for employing the favored hack man create that virtual monopoly which is the ground of objection On principle and authority therefore the case might better have been decided the other way Harvard Law Review LOST WILLSWILL LAST KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN IN POSSESSION OF A THIRD PERSONIn an editorial note to the opinion of the court in the case of In Re Augur Probate Court of New Haven Conn in which was involved the ques tion of the legal effect of evidence showing that a lost will was last known to have been in the possession of a third person the Yale Law Journal says This case is interesting for the reason that it deals with substantially a new point of law i e the legal effect of evidence showing that a lost will was last known to have been in the possession of another than the testator Practically all the cases deal with the presumption of revocation arising where a lost will was last known to have been in the possession of the testator In the very few cases where the lost will was out of the testators possession it is generally clearly shown that the will was so entirely out of the testators possession that he could not destroy it animo revocandi and remained so until his death In none of the cases does the court carefully consider the question of the legal effect of proving that a lost will was last known to he in the possession of another than the maker and in none of them do the counsel appear to discuss it See the cases cited in the body of the opinion  As might be inferred from the opinion the counsel for the proponent at the trial of the case claimed that the rule of law was as stated in Jarman on Will I 133 Woerners American Law of Administration I 91 Greenleaf on Evi dence II sec 681 and Thornton on Lost Wills sec 64  These authorities state the rule to be that If a will once executed is not found at its makers death it is presumed revoked but that if the will is traced out of the deceaseds custody it is incumbent on the party asserting the revocation to prove that the will came again into such custody or was destroyed by his direc tion Jarman as cited On this point Jarman cites Colvin v Fraser 2 Hagg Eccl Rep 327 Wynn v Heveningham 1 Coll 638 639 Greenleaf cites Jarman Minkler v Minkler 14 Vt 245 Helyar v Helyar 1 Lee 472 Lillie v Lillie 3 Hagg 184 Loxley v Jackson 3 Phillim 126 and Jackson v Betts 9 Cowen 208 Woerner and Thornton apparently rely on the case of Dawson v Smith 3 Houst Del 335 Jarmans citation of Colvin v Fraser on this point would seem to be due to a note to the case of Lillie v Lillie in the 3d of Haggard which states the law in this way and gives Colvin v Faser as authority In that case the will was known to have been for nine years before he died in the testatorss possession In Wynn v Heveningham the will was found mutilated and having been proved at all times to have been in the hands of a custodian it was found by the court not the work of the testator The other cases cited by Jarman Woerner Greenleaf and Thornton will all be found to have been decided on another point except Dawson v Smith This as indicated in the opinion above is merely a charge to a jury and the judge says the whole matter is a question of fact Thus it is seen that the exception to the rule as stated has a very slender130 6 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER June foundation in authority Much apparently has been inferred from the statement that the presumption of revocation arises where the will has been traced into the testators possession The opinion shows that in its bald form it cannot be correct The main rule or presumption as stated in the opinion and by Chancellor Walworth in the case of Betts v Jackson 6 Wend 173 has its foundation in ex perience which teaches that the absence of a will is presumptive evidence of its revocation This presumption however may be overcome by showing in any of a variety of ways that it is improbable that the will was revoked This may be done by showing that the will was destroyed without the testators knowledge Brown v Brown 10 Yerg 84 by showing that the testatorss circumstances did not change after the making of the will and that he seemed satisfied with the disposition he had made of his property Legarre v Ashe 1 Bay S C 464 MIcBeth v McBeth 11 Ala 596 Fosters Appeal 87 Pa

St 343 Collagan v Burns 57 Me 449 Scroggins v Turner 98 N C 135 Eekersley v Pratt L R 1 P D 281 Minkler v Minkler ut sup by showing that it was out of the testators pos session that he could not destroy it see cases cited in the opinion and finally by showing generally that the probability is that the will was not revoked see cases above cited and Welch v Phillips 1 Moore P C 299 In effect the rule might be stated that the will is presumed revoked unless satisfactorily accounted for or unless it is shown in some other way that the probability is it wasnt de stroyed by the testator The famous case of Sugden v Lord St Leonards ut sup amounts to this See also the opinion in Southworth v Adams ut sup  The effect of the presumption is this if there is no evidence to the contrary the absence of the will establishes a prima facie case that it was destroyed animo revocandi if there is evidence to the contrary then the presumption is a page from the experience of the judges to be borne in mind by the trier in weighing tlhe evidence see Thayer Evidence at the Common Law pp 336 346  If this is the true scope of the presumption the exception cannot be correctly stated by these textbooks It would then be stronger than the rule If it is not true that in all cases under all circumstances the absence of the will throws on the proponents the duty of showing the existence of the will at the testators death or its destruction without his knowledge and consent before his death it cannot be true that merely to trace the will out of the testators possession is enough to throw on the contestants the duty of showing its destruction by the testator or that it came again into his possession In many cases as in the present the tracing of the will into the possession of another might not raise any proba bility that the testator never got it again or that he did not revoke it The cus todian might be in daily intercourse with the testator and other facts might de velop which on the proponents own evidence would so counteract the effects of the testimony as not to leave it weight enough to rebut the main presumption Moreover any rule as to the effect of such evidence would seem needless It needs no experience in dealing with wills to appreciate its weight If a testator couldnt get at his will he couldnt destroy it That is common sense Law on the subject is unnecessary The only case really out of harmony with the law as above stated is the case1900 MISCELLANY 131 of Sprigge v Sprigge L R 1 P D 608 where it is held that if the maker of a will becomes insane before death and at his death a will known to have been made by him cannot be found those contesting its probate must show its destruc tion while he was sane This would seem inconsistent with the trend of the law and a broader statement than the case requires It is easy to imagine cases in which its application would work hardship See Shacklett v Roller 97 Va 639 5 Va Law Reg 616 UNIFORM DIVORCE LAWSWe received some months ago from the Committee on Publication of the Conference of State Commissioners for the promotion of Uniformity of State laws the subjoined copy of bills drawn by that Committee looking to uniformity of divorce laws The failure heretofore to publish these in the REGISTER is due to inadvertence We also print the copy of the brief report of the Committee accompanying the proposed bills The officers of the Conference are Lyman D Brewster President Danbury Conn D L Withington VicePresident San Diego Cal Albert B Henschel Secretary 214 Broadway New York and J Moss Ives Assistant Secretary Danbury Conn We have not given the substance of these proposed bills sufficient attention to be able to express an opinion as to the wisdom of the proposed legislation So far as their form goes no alteration seems desirable in order to fillfill the require ments of the Virginia Constitution If adopted in Virginia a careful schedule of the sections of the Virginia Code superseded by this legislation should be made and an express repealing clause added We are suffering in Virginia now from a failure to append such a schedule and repealing clause to the Negotiable Instruments Law adopted by the legislature of 189798 BRIEF REPORT BY THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLICATION OF THE CONFERENCE OF COMMISSIONERS ON UNIFORM STATE LAWS OF THE DOINGS OF THE CONFER ENCE AT THE NINTH ANNUAL MEETING THEREOF HELD AT BUFFALO AU GUST 25 26 AND 28 1899 Inasmuch as it is intended to make the ninth annual report of the Conference somewhat more full and elaborate than has hitherto been attempted and as it will take some months for its preparation it was voted on motion of Mr Lewis N Dembitz of Kentucky that the acts prepared on divorce considered at that con ference with a brief statement of the reasons therefor be at once prepared and sent by the committee to all the commissioners At the Ninth Annual Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws held at Buffalo on the 25th 26th and 28th days of August 1899 the time of the con ference was exclusively taken up with the question of uniformity in the divorce laws of the various States In most of the States creating commissions this is the first subject the commissioners are instructed to cousider Its consideration pre viously had been necessarily deferred until a sufficient number of States was rep resented to obtain the views and knowledge of commissioners from all parts of the Union Of the two bills submitted herewith it is first to be noticed that the Act on divorce procedure is the carefully studied result of the three days conference after going over the draft reported by the committee on divorce It goes over for132 6 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER June final action another year as is usual with all the recommendations of the confer ence that it may be submitted to the commissioners who were not present at the meeting Of course it is subject to change at the next conference if found un adapted in expression to the jurisdictions not represented at Buffalo Otherwise it is put out as a finished bill embodying the decision of the conference on that branch of the subject It hardly needs saying that this uniform law on divorce procedure if generally adopted seemed to the commissioners adapted to prevent in some degree migra tory divorces by which the laws of one State are practically nullified by a tempo rary residence in another State to render less easy frauds on the courts to give the respondent fuller opportunity of defense and especially to make the final effect of a divorce the same all over the Union On the other hand the proposed bill on the causes of divorce has not in any sense been adopted or passed upon by the commissioners but is simply the report of the committee on divorce presented by them for consideration and after a slight discussion continued over to the next meeting for further action The committee reported that the five causes enumerated in the bill are at pres ent the specified existing causes in about forty States Several other causes refer ring to conditions at or before marriage are of course not enumerated in a bill referring only to causes arising afte marriage With the exception of omnibus clauses such as those allowing divorce for any reasons satisfactory to the court or for any cause defeating the purposes of the marriage relation this is now the law substantially in a great majority of the States The committee believed that these omnibus clauses were not only liable to abuse but gave the court a latitude of discretion unjust to respondents and incompatible with the theory of a government by fixed laws The two States which occupy the anomalous position of recognizing but one cause or no causes for absolute divorce would probably be unaffected by the bill except as their citi zens were divorced in other States It is especially and urgently requested that all the commissioners not present at the Buffalo meeting and all committees on uniform State laws send a statement of their views on the proposed bills to the assistant secretary and in particular 1 whether the act of procedure is constitutional in their States or 2 properly phrased to correspond with their statutory methods and 3 whether it is advisa ble to recommend a bill on causes of divorce LEWIS N DEMBITZ E BURRITT SMITH DAVID L WITHINGTON August 31 1899 Committee

continuous cram And just having stood the Supreme Court exam Methought that I stood in the courtroom deserted The lawyers all gone and the judges departed And witnessed indeed a most curious sight Two weirdlooking spectres engaged in a fight While hundreds of others galloped up with a shout To see what the battle was waging about I eagerly scanned them and quite overjoyed Discovered they were terms that Id often employed There were Pleas in Abatement and Contracts and Bailments And long Bills in Equity for all kinds of ailments Respondeat Ouster and Rents of all sorts Judgments and Motions and numerous Torts And each of the rivals I knew like a brother Non Assumpsit was one Non IEst Factum the other The former was large broadshouldered blueeyed The latter was small with dark eyes flashing

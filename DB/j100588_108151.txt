ORGAN,I206997, 173  XI AN APPENDIX TO A PAPER ON THE NERVOUS GANGLIA OF THE UTERUS WITH A FURTHER ACCOUNT OF THE NERVOUS STRUCTURES OF THAT ORGAN BY ROBERT LEE MD FRS COLL REG MED SOCIUS RECEIVED JUNE 16READ JUNE 16 1842 FROM THE FUNCTIONS OF THE HUMAN UTERUS GALEN INFERRED THAT IT MUST BE SUPPLIED WITH NERVES BUT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO PROVE THAT GALEN OR ANY OF THE CELEBRATED ANATOMISTS WHO FLOURISHED BEFORE THE MIDDLE OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY EVER TRACED THE GREAT SYMPATHETIC AND SACRAL NERVES INTO THE UTERUS OR DISCOVERED THAT ITS NERVES ENLARGE DURING PREGNANCY THIS WAS FIRST DONE BY DR W HUNTER WHO DESCRIBES THE HYPOGASTRIC NERVE ON EACH SIDE AS PASSING TO THE GRAVID UTERUS BEHIND THE HYPOGASTRIC VESSELS AND SPREADING OUT IN BRANCHES LIKE THE PORTIO DURA OF THE SEVENTH PAIR OR LIKE THE STICKS OF A FAN WITH MANY COMMUNICATIONS OVER THE WHOLE SIDE OF THE UTERUS AND VAGINA AS DR HUNTER NEVER EXAMINED THE NERVES OF THE UNIMPREGNATED UTERUS AND SAW THE NERVES OF THE GRAVID UTERUS DISSECTED ONLY IN ONE SUBJECT HE DID NOT CERTAINLY KNOW THAT THEY INCREASED AFTER CONCEPTION  I CANNOT HE OBSERVES TAKE UPON ME TO SAY WHAT CHANGE HAPPENS TO THE SYSTEM OF UTERINE NERVES FIOMN UTEROGESTATION BUT I SUSPECT THEM TO BE ENLARGED IN PROPORTION AS THE VESSELS MR JOHN HUNTER DENIED THAT THE NERVES OF THE UTERUS EVER ENLARGED DURING PREG NANCY  THE UTERUS IN THE TIME OF PREGNANCY HE SAYS  INCREASES IN SUBSTANCE AND SIZE PROBABLY FIFTY TIMES BEYOND WHAT IT NATURALLY IS AND YET WE FIND THAT THE NERVES OF THIS PART ARE NOT IN THE SMALLEST DEGREE INCREASED THIS SHOWS THAT THE BRAIN AND NERVES HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ACTIONS OF A PART WHILE THE VESSELS WHICH ARE EVIDENT INCREASE IN PROPORTION TO THE INCREASED SIZE IF THE SAME HAD TAKEN PLACE WITH THE NERVES WE SHOULD HAVE REASONED FROM ANALOGYT DR WILLIAM HUNTER LEFT NO PREPATATIONS OF THE NERVES OF THE UTERUS NOR DID MR J HIUNTER IN SUPPORT OF THEIR CONFLICTING STATEMENTS AND AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR 1838 I BELIEVE THERE WERE NO PREPARATIONS IN THIS COUNTRY SHOWING THE NERVES OF THE UTERUS DISSECTED EITHER IN THE UNIMPREGNATED OR GRAVID STATE SIR ASTLEY COOPER THEN MAINTAINED THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE NERVES OF THE UTERUS OR THE NERVES OF ANY OTHER ORGAN TO INCREASE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES IN 1822 PROFESSOR TIEDEMANN PUBLISHED A DESCRIPTION OF THE NERVES OF THE UTERUS WITH TWO ENGRAVINGS IN THE FIRST THE SPERMATIC NERVES ARE REPRESENTED ON BOTH SIDES ACCOMPANYING THE SPERMATIC ARTERIES TO THE OVARIA THE SPERMATIC VEINS AND THE  AN ANATOMICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE HUMAN GRAVID UTERUS LOND 1794 P 21 T THE WORKS OF J HUNTER VOL III P 117 AD 1837DR LEES FURTHER ACCOUNT OF NERVES WHICH FOLLOWED THEM ARE NOT SEEN A FEW SMALL BRANCHES OF NERVES FROM THE HYPOGASTRIC PLEXUS ARE SEEN RAMIFYING ON THE POSTERIOR AND INFERIOR SURFACE OF THE UTERUS WITH THE UTERINE ARTERIES THE WHOLE OF THE SUPERIOR PART OF THE UTERUS IS CO VERED WITH PERITONEUM IN THE SECOND PLATE SOME SMALL BRANCHES FROM THE LEFT HY POGASTRIC NERVE BEFORE IT ENTERS THE GREAT GANGLION AT THE CERVIX ARE SEEN ACCORN PANYING THE LEFT UTERINE ARTERY ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE LOWER PART OF THE UTERUS FROM PR1OFESSOR TIEDEMANNS WORK IT MIGHT JUSTLY BE INFERRED THAT THE HUMAN GRAVID UTERUS IS MORE SPARINGLY SUPPLIED WITH NERVES THAN ANY OTHER ORGAN IN THE BODY IN 1823 PROFESSOR LOBSTEIN STATED THAT THE UTERUS BEFORE AND AFTER CONCEPTION HAD A VERY SCANTY SUPPLY OF NERVES RARISSIME IN UTERI SUBSTANTIAM TURN VACUI TUM GRAVIDI SESE IMMITTERE VIDENTUR NERVORUM SURCULI IN 1829 PROFESSOR OSIANDER AFFIRMED TLLAT THE NERVES OF THE HUMAN UTERUS HAD NEVER BEEN SEEN EITHER BY HIMSELF OR BY ANY OTHER ANATOMIST AND THAT HE HAD BEEN DECEIVED BY THE AUTHORITY OF SCIENTIFIC PERSONS WHEN HE STATED THAT NERVES WERE SPREAD OVER THE WHOLE UTERUS ON THE 8TH OF APRIL 1838 WHILE DISSECTING A GRAVID UTERUS OF SEVEN MONTHS I AC CIDENTALLY OBSERVED THE TRUNK OF A LARGE NERVE PROCEEDING UPWARD FROM THE CERVIX TO THE BODY OF THE UTERUS ALONG WITH THE RIGHT UTERINE VEIN AND SENDIING OFF BRANCHES IN ITS COURSE TO THE POSTERIOR SURFACE OF THE UTERUS SOME OF WHICH ACCOMPANIED THE RA MIFICATIONS OF THE VEIN AND OTHERS WERE INSERTED INTO THE PERITONEUM A BROAD BAND RESEMIBLING A PLEXUS OF NERVES WAS SEEN EXTENDING ACROSS THE POSTERIOR SURFACE OF THE UTERUS AND COVERING THE NERVE MIDWAY BETWEEN THE FUNDUS AND THE CERVIX ON THE LEFT SIDE THE SAME APPEARANCES WERE SEEN AND SEVERAL BRANCHES OF THE NERVES ACCOM PANYING THE UTERINE VEIN WERE DISTINCTLY CONTINUOUS WITH BRANCHES OF THE GREAT PLEXUS CROSSING THE BODY OF THE UTERUS THE PREPARATION WAS PLACED IN THE MUSEUM OF ST GEORGES HOSPITAL ON THE 1ST OF OCTOBER 1838 SEVERAL EMINENT ANATOMISTS TO WHOM I SHOWED THE PREPARATION THOUGHT THAT I HAD BEEN MISLED BY APPEARANCES AND THAT THEY WERE ABSORBENT VESSELS ACCOMPANYING THE VEINS AND TENDINOUS FIBRES SPREAD ACROSS THE POSTERIOR SURFACE OF THE UTERUS THEY ALL ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THEY HAD NEVER SEEN NOR DISSECTED THE NERVES OF THE UTERUS EITHER IN THE HUMAN SUBJECT OR IN ANY OF THE LOWER ANIMALS I RESOLVED WHEN ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY SHOULD PRESENT TO FOLLOW THE SYMPATHETIC INTO THE GRAVID UTERUS WITH THE UTMOST CARE THAT I MIGHT DISCOVER IF POSSIBLE THE NATURE OF THE GREAT PLEXUSES COVERING ITS SURFACE ON THE 18TH OF DECEMBER 1838 A WOMAN IN THE SIXTH MONTH OF PREGNANCY DIED IN ST GEORGES HOSPITAL A FEW HOURS AFTER THE FOETUS AND ITS APPENDAGES HAD BEEN EXPELLED THE UTERUS WAS REMOVED WITH ALL ITS BLOODVESSELS AND NERVES REMAINING CONNECTED WITH IT AND THE GREAT SYMPATHETIC AND SACRAL NERVES WERE TRACED TO THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE UTERUS WHILE THE PREPARATION WAS UNDER ALCOHOL IN A COMMUNICATION TO THIS SOCIETY WHICH WAS READ ON THE 12TH OF DECEMBER 1839  TABULAE NERVORUM UTERI FOL HEIDELBERGAE 1822 T DE NERVI SYMPATHETICA HUMANI FABRICA C PARIS 1823 P 31 174THE GANGLIA AND NERVES OF THE UTERUS I DESCRIBED THE APPEARANCES DISPLAYED IN THESE DISSECTIONS AND REPRESENTED BY FIGURES THE SPERMATIC HYPOGASTRIC AND SACRAL NERVES PASSING INTO FOUR GREAT PLEXUSES UNDER THE PERITONEUM OF THE BODY OF THE UTERUS FROM THE FORM COLOUR VASCULARITY AND GENERAL DISTRIBUTION OF THESE PLEXUSES AND FROM THEIR BRANCHES ACTUALLY COALESCING WITH THOSE OF THE GREAT SYMPATHETIC I INFERRED THAT THEY WERE TRUE NERVOUS GANGLIONIC PLEXUSES AND FORMED THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OF THE UTERUS SOME ANATOMISTS OF REPUTATION FORMED A DIFFERENT OPINION AND CONCLUDED THAT THEY WERE NOTHING BUT BANDS OF ELASTIC TISSUE GELATINOUS TISSUE OR CELLTLAR MEMBRANE CONNECTING THE PERITONEUM WITH THE MUSCULART COAT OF THE UTERUS ALL WHO EXAMINED THE DISSECTIONS ADMITTED THAT THE PLEXUSES WERE ACCOMPANIED WITH ARTERIES AND WERE CONTINUOUS WITH THE SPERMATIC AND HYPO GASTRIC NERVES NONE ATTENIPTED TO SHOW IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE BODY BANDS OF ELASTIC TISSUE ASSUMING A SIMILAR PLEXIFORM APPEARANCE ACCOMPANIED WITH ARTERIES OR CONTINUOUS WITH NERVES THE COMMUNICATION WAS WITHDRAWN FROM THE ROYAL SOCIETY I CONTINUED THE INVESTIGATION OF THIS SUBJECT DURING THE WHOLE OF 1840 AND 1841 AND DISCOVERED THE GREAT NERVOUS GANGLIA AT THE NECK OF THE UTERUS A DESCRIPTION OF WHICH IS CONTAINED IN THE LAST VOLUME OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS BUT THESE GANGLIA WHICH EXCEED IN SIZE THE SEMILUNAR GANGLIA OF THE GREAT SYMPATHETIC CON STITUTE ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OF THE HUMAN UTERUS I PROPOSE NOW BRIEFLY TO DESCRIBE OTHER NERVOUS STRUCTURES OF FAR GREATER SIZE AS DISPLAYED IN THE DISSECTION OF A GRAVID UTERUS AT THE END OF THE NINTH MONTH ONH F PREGNANCY IN THIS PREPARATION THE GREAT SYMPATHETIC NERVE SENDS NUMEROUS BRANCHES FROM BOTH ITS CORDS TO THE TRUNK OF THE INFERIOR MESENTERIC ARTERY WHICH FORMN A GREAT PLEXUS AROUND IT THESE NERVES ACCOMPANY ALL THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THE ARTERY BUT THE GREATER NUMBER PROCEED WITH THE HEMORRHOIDAL ARTERY TO THE RECTUM THE TWO CORDS OF THE GREAT SYMPATHETIC AFTER GIVING OFF THESE BRANCHES TO THE INFERIOR MESENTERIC ARTERY PASS DOWN BEFORE THE AORTA NEARLY TWO INCHES BELOW ITS BIFURCATION WHERE THEY ARE UNITED BY SEVERAL FINE NERVOUS FILAMENTS BUT THE CORDS CONTINUE DISTINCT AND SOON SEPARATING EACH PASSES DOWN BEHITND THE HYPOGASTRIC BLOODVESSELS TO THE SIDE OF THE NECK OF THE UTERUS AND THERE TERMINATES IN THE CORRESPONDING HYPOGASTTIC OR UTEROCERVICAL GANGLION THE LEFT CORD OF THE GREAT SYMPATHETIC OR AS IT IS USUALLY CALLED THE HYPOGASTRIC NERVE ENLARGES GREATLY AS IT APPROACHES THE HYPOGASTRIC GAN GLION THIS GANGLION IS NEARLY TWO INCHES IN BREADTH AND COVERS A GREAT PART OF THE CERVIX UTERI IT APPEARS TO CONSIST OF SIX OR SEVEN SMALLER GANGLIA WHICH ARE UNITED TOGETHER BY NERVOUS CORDS EACH OF THESE GANGLIA IS A THICK SOLID NERVOUS MASS OF AN ORANGE WHITE COLOUR INCLINED TO BROWN ARTERIES WHICH HAVE BEEN INJECTED PASS THROUGH THESE SMALLER GANGLIA AND ACCOMPANY THE VARIOUS NERVOUS FILAMENTS WHICH PROCEED FROM THEM INTO THE WHOLE OUTER SURFACE OF THE LEFT HYPOGASTRIC GAN GLION NUMEROUS BRANCHES FROM THE THIRD SACRAL NERVE ENTER AND BEHIND THERE IS A GREAT CONNECTION FORMED BETWEEN THE GANGLION AND THE BRANCHES OF THE LEFT HEMOR RHOIDAL NERVE THE VAGINAL NERVES ARISE FROM THE INFERIOR MARGIN OF THE GANGLION AND THE VESICAL FROM ITS ANTERIOR BORDER SOME OF THESE NERVES PASS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE 175DR LEES FURTHER ACCOUNT OF URETER TO ENTER THE MIDDLE VESICAL GANGLION AND OTHERS PASS ON THE INNER SURFACE OF THE URETER TO THE ANTERIOR PART OF THE NECK OF THE UTERUS FROM THE SUPERIOL AND ANTERIOR PART OF THE LEFT HYPOGASTRIC GANGLION A PLEXUS OF NERVES ACCOMPANIED BY AN INJECTED TORTUOUS ARTELY PROCEEDS UPWARD ALONG THE WHOLE BODY OF THE UTERUS NEAR TE LEFT SIDE TO THE TRK OFTO THE LEFT SPERMATIC VEIN AND THERE TERMINATES IN A DENSE REDDISH BROWN COLOURED MASS CONSISTING OF FIBRES FIRMLY INTERLACED TOGETHER AND WHICH HAS ALL THE CHARACTERS OF A TRUE NERVOUS GANGLION FROMN ITS VICINITY TO THE PRINCIPAL SPMAIC RTERAT Y AND VEIN WHICH IT PARTLY SURROUNDS AND THE LIGAENT OF THE OVARY IT MAY BE CALLED THE LEFT SPERMATIC GANGLION BETWEEN THIS GANGLION AND THE LEFT HYPOGASTRIC GANGLION AN ARTERY EXTENDS WHICH IS CLOSELY EMBRACED BY A PLEXUS OF NERVES AND A DIRECT NERVOUS COMMUNICATION IS THUS ESTA BLISHED BETWEEN THESE REMOTE GANGLIA THE NERVES ADHERED SO FIRMLY TO THE ARTERY THROUGH ITS WHOLE COURSE THAT BEFORE THEY WERE SEPARATED THEY PRESENTED THE APPEAR ANCE OF TWO WHITE LINES ON ITS SIDES WITH FILAMENTS CROSSING OVER THE VESSEL FROM THESE NERVES EXTENDING BETWEEN THE LEFT HYPOGASTRIC AND SPERMATIC GANGLION BRANCHES WITH ARTERIES ARE GIVEN OFF IN THEIR WHOLE COURSE TO THE SUBPERITONEAL GANGLIA AND PLEXUSES ON THE POSTERIOR SURFACE OF THE UTERUS AND ALSO BRANCHES TO TH E PLEXUSES ON THE ANTERIOR SURFACE ON APPROACHING THE SPERMATIC GANGLION THESE NERVES WITH THEIR ARTELRY PASS UNDER OR BETWEEN THE BRANCHES OF THE LEFT SUBPERITONEAL PLEXUSES AND FIFEQUENTLY COMMUNICATE WITH THEN BY FINE NERVOUS FILAMENTS THE ARTERY CAN BE READILY TRACED THROUGH THE SUBSTANCE OF TLE SPERMATIC GANGLION BUT THE NERVES WHICH ACCOMPANY IT FROM THE HYPOGASTRIC GANGLION IMMEDIATELY DISAPPEAR ON ENTER ING THE MASS NUMEROUS LARGE BRANCHES OF NERVES FROM THE LEFT SUBPERITONEAL PLEXUS LIKEWISE TERMINATE IN THE LEFT SPERMATIC GANGLION BUT SOME OF THEM PASS UNDER IT AND PROCEED TO THE ROUND LIGAMENT AND OTHERS ARE CONTINUED UPWARD GRADUALLY DIMINISHING IN SIZE AS THEY APPROACH THE RENAL PLEXUS ALONG THE SPERMNATIC BLOOD VESSELS FROTM THE UPPER BORDER OF THIS GANGLION LARGE FLAT NERVES PROCEED TO RAMIFY ON THE FUNDUS UTERI AND PASS WITH THE VESSELS INTO THE MUSCULAR COAT THE TRUNK OF THE SPERMATIC VEIN AND ARTERY IS ALMOST COMPLETELY SURROUNDED WITH THIS GANGLION AS THE TRUNLKS OF THE UTERINE AND VAGINAL ARTERIES AND VEINS ARE INCLOSED WITHIN RINGS OF NERVE CONNECTED WITH THE HYPOGASTRIC GANGLION IN THIS DISSECTION THERE ARE NERVOUS STRUCTURES DISPLAYED ON THE ANTERIOR AND POS TERIOR SURFACES OF THE UTERUS OF STILL GREATER MAGNITUDE THESE FROM THEIR SITUATION MAY BE CALLED THE SUBPERITONEAL GANGLIA AND PLEXUSES OF THE UTERUS OVER THE MIDDLE OF THE LOWER PART OF THE BODY OF THE UTERUS BEHIND IMMEDIATELY BENEATH THE PERITONEUM IS SITUATED THE POSTERIOR SUBPERITONEAL GANGLION WHICH IS CONSIDERABLY LARGER THAN THE LEFT HYPOGASTRIC GANGLION IT PRESENTS THE APPEARANCE OF A LAYER OF DENSE STRUCTURE COMPOSED OF FIBRES STRONGLY INTERLACED TOGETHER HAVING A YELLOWISH BROWN COLOUR IT ADHERES FIRMLY TO THE PERITONEUM BUT BETWEEN ITS LOWER SURFACE AND THE MUSCULAR COAT OF THE UTERUS THERE IS INTERPOSED A THICK SOFT LAYER OF CELLULAR SUBSTANCE THROUGH WHICH FILAMENTS OF NERVES AND BRANCHLES OF CON 176THE GANGLIA AND NERVES OF THE UTERUS SIDERABLE SIZE PASS TO THE MUSCULAR COAT OF THE UTERUS THE MIDDLE PART OF THE GANGLION IS MORE THAN TWO LINES IN THICKNESS BUT IT BECOMES EVERYWHERE THINNER TOWARDS THE CIRCUMFERENCE AND PARTICULARLY AT THE INFERIOR BORDER WHERE ITSENDS OFF MANY NERVES TO THE BACK PART OF THE VAGINA FROM ITS LEFT LOWER ANDLATERAL PART IT SENDS OFF TWO LAYERS OF BROAD NERVES ONE OF WHICH ADHERES TO THE PERITONEUM AND THE OTHER CLOSELY INVESTS THE MUSCULAR COAT AND BLOODVESSELS OF THE UTERUS BETWEEN THESE LAYERS THERE IS PLACED A VERY THICK MASS OF SOFT CELLULAR MEMBRANE THROUGH WHICH INNUMERABLE BRANCHES OF NERVES PASS BETWEEN THESE LAYERS THE HYPOGASTRIC GANGLION AND THE PLEXUS OF NERVES WITH THE INJECTED ARTERY EXTENDING BETWEEN THE HYPOGASTRIC AND SPERMATIC GANGLIA MANY OF THE SUPERFICIAL NERVES PASS DOWN UNDER THE PERITONEUM AND TERMINATE IN THE UPPER BORDER OF THE LEFT HYPOGASTRIC GANGLION AND UPON THESE SUPERFICIAL NERVES THERE IS FORMED ANOTHER GANGLION OF CONSIDERABLE SIZE BETWEEN WHICH AND THE HYPOGASTRIC NERVE NUMEROUS BRANCHES OF SOFT NERVES EXTEND THIS GANGLION FORMED ON THE NERVES UNDER THE PERITONEUNM NEAR THE EDGE OF THE UTERUS IS THICK AND SOLID AND CONSISTS OF A YELLOWISH BROWN SUBSTANCE WITH WHITE NERVOUS FILAMENTS INTERLACED AND ARTERIES OF CONSIDERABLE SIZE PASSING THROUGH IT FROM ITS LOWER BORDER LARGE NERVES EXTEND TO THE UPPER EDGE OF THE HYPOGASTRIC GANGLION AND INNUMERABLE SOFT NERVES ENTER THE WHOLE INNER SURFACE OF THE HYPOGASTRIC GAN GLION WHICH TAKE THEIR ORIGIN FROM THE LOWER PART OF THE GREAT SUBPERITONEAL GANGLION THE UPPER PART OF THIS GANGLION BECOMES FIRMLY ADHERENT BOTH TO THE PERITONETUM AND MUSCULAR COAT OF THE UTERUS WHICH IT COVERS AS HIGH AS THE FUNDUS LARGE BROAD NERVOUS PLEXUSES SULPERFICIAL AND DEEP EXTEND FROM THE UPPER PORTION OF THE SUBPE RITONEAL GANGLION ACROSS THE BODY OF THE UTERUS TO THE SPERMATIC GANGLION AND BLOOD VESSELS AND THE ROUND LIGAMENT AROUND WHICH THEY FORM A SHEATH OF NERVES IN AN ELABORATE DRAWING BY MR JOSEPH PERRY ALL THE GANGLIA AND PLEXUSES ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE UTERUS NOW DESCRIBED HAVE BEEN REPRESENTED WITH THE GREATEST FIDELITY AS THE ARTERIES AND VEINS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE UTERUS ARE ONLY PARTIALLY INJECTED THE NERVES EXTENDING BETWEEN THE HYPOGASTRIC AND SPERMATIC GANGLIA HAVE NOT BEEN SO MINUTELY TRACED BUT THAT THERE IS A SIMILAR NERVOUS CHAIN CONNECTING THESE GREAT GANGLIA OF THE FUNDUS AND CERVIX AND THE SUBPERITONEAL GANGLIA AND PLEXUSES DOES NOT ADMIT OF DOUBT AND HAS BEEN CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED BY OTHER DISSECTIONS AT AN EARLIER PERIOD OF PREGNANCY OVER THE MIDDLE OF THE ANTERIOR AND LOWER PART OF THE BODY OF THE UTERUS THERE IS SITUATED A NERVOUS AND VASCULAR MASS OF GREAT EXTENT AND SIMILAR IN STRUCTURE TO THE SUBPERITONEAL GANGLIA DESCRIBED ON THE POSTERIOR SURFACE IT ADHERES TO THE PERITO NEUM FIRMLY BUT ON BEING DIVIDED LONGITUDINALLY IT IS ALSO OBSERVED TO BE SEPARATED FROM THE MUSCULAR COAT OF THE UTERUS BY A SOFT STRATUM OF CELLULAR MEMBRANE FROM THE LOWER PART OF THIS ANTERIOR SUBPERITONEAL GANGLION NERVES ARE SENT DOWN TO TIHE CERVIX UTERI AND VAGINA AND NUMEROUS BRANCHES PASS OFF ON BOTH SIDES TO THE HYPO GASTRIC GANGLIA SUPERFICIAL AND DEEP PLEXUSES OF NERVES ARE LIKEWISE SENT OFF FROM ITS SUPERIOR LATERAL BORDERS WHICH PROCEED ACROSS THE UTERUS SENDING BRANCHES INTO MDCCCXLII 2 A 1177DR LEES FURTHER ACCOUNT OF THE MUSCULAR COAT AND UNITING WITH ALL THE GANGLIONIC PLEXUSES ON THE POSTERIOR SUR FACE THE APPEARANCES PRESENTED BY THE ANTERIOR SUBPERITONEAL GANGLIA AND PLEXUSES IN THE FOURTH MONTH OF PREGNANCY HAVE BEEN DISPLAYED IN THE SECOND ENGRAVING WHICH ILLUSTRATED THE PAPER ON THE NERVOUS GANGLIA OF THE UTERUS AT THAT PERIOD THE GAN GLION SEEMED NOTHING BUT A THIN NERVOUS AND VASCULAR MEMBRANE IMBEDDED IN SOFT CELLULAR SUBSTANCE THROUGH WHICH THE DELICATE NERVOUS FILAMENTS ACCOMPANIED WITH ARTERIES PROCEEDED TO THE SUPERIOR ANGLES OF THE UTERUS ON COMPARING THIS DISSEC TION WITH THAT NOW DESCRIBED IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO AVOID BEING STRUCK WITH THE ENOR MOUS DEVELOPMENT OF THESE NERVOUS STRUCTURES DURING THE FOUR LATTER MONTHS OF PREG NANCY OR TO RESIST THE CONCLUSION THAT THESE ARE FORMED FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUPPLYING THE UTERUS WITH THAT NERVOUS POWER WHICH IT REQUIRES DURING LABOUR THESE DISSECTIONS PROVE THAT THE HUMAN UTERUS POSSESSES A GREAT SYSTEM OF NERVES WHICH ENLARGES WITH THE COATS BLOODVESSELS AND ABSORBENTS DURING PREGNANCY AND WHICH RETURNS AFTER PARTURITION TO ITS ORIGINAL CONDITION BEFORE CONCEPTION TAKES PLACE IT IS CHIEFLY BY THE INFLUENCE OF THESE NERVES THAT THE UTERUS PERFORMS THE VARIED FUNCTIONS OF MENSTRUATION CONCEPTION AND PARTURITION AND IT IS SOLELY BY THEIR MEANS THAT THE WHOLE FABRIC OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM SYMPATHISES WITH THE DIFFERENT MORBID AFFECTIONS OF THE UTERUS IF THESE NERVES OF THE UTERUS COULD NOT BE DEMONSTRATED ITS PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY WOULD BE COMPLETELY INEXPLICABLE EXPLANATION OF THE PLATE PLATE XIV EXHIBITS THE GANGLIA AND NERVES ON THE POSTERIOR AND LEFT SIDE OF THE GRAVID UTERUS AT THE END OF THE NINTH MONTH OF

ISAAC N SELIGMAN CHAIRMAN PRO TEMPORE NATIONAL CHILD LABOR COMMITTEE NEW YORK CITY IT IS A GREAT PRIVILEGE FOR ME FORMALLY TO OPEN THESE INTERESTING SESSIONS AND I BRING TO YOU ALL A MESSAGE OF CHEER AND ENCOURAGE MENT FROM THE EAST THE HONOR OF ADDRESSING YOU TODAY FALLS ON MY SHOULDERS AS TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN OUR CHAIRMAN PROFESSOR FELIX ADLERTHAT VALIANT CHAMPION IN ALL MOVEMENTS FOR THE BETTERMENT OF HIS FELLOWBEINGSHAS BEEN CALLED TO BERLIN UNIVERSITY WHERE HE IS NOW DELIVERING A COURSE OF USEFUL LECTURES IT WAS HE WHO FROM THE VERY FIRST MEETING FOR THE ORGANIZATION OF THE NATIONAL CHILD LABOR COMMITTEE HAS GIVEN IT ITS BEST IDEALS AND FROM HIM OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND WORKERS THROUGHOUT THE SEVERAL STATES RECEIVED CONSTANTLY FRESH IN CENTIVE AND INSPIRATION IN THE PERFORNMNCE AND CONTINUANCE OF THE WORK I AM ACTIVELY INTERESTED IN MANY FIELDS OF SOCIAL WORK BUT I VENTURE TO SAY THAT FEW IF ANY OF THEM HAVE AFFORDED ME KEENER PLEASURE OR MORE THOROUGH SATISFACTION THAN MY ASSOCIATION WITH THE CHILD LABOR MOVEMENT IT IS CUSTOMARY IN FORMALLY OPENING PROCEEDINGS TO RENDER AN ACCOUNT OF OUR STEWARDSHIPWHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED WHAT GOAL IT WAS HOPED TO ACHIEVE WHEREIN OBSTACLES HAVE BEEN ENCOUNTERED TO REVIEW THE OPERATIONS OF LAST YEAR AFFORDS A PLEASING RETROSPECT THE COMMITTEE HAS PRACTICALLY NO FLOATING DEBT IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT IT IS MUCH SIMPLER TO FINANCE A SURPLUS THAN A DEFICIT THE COM MITTEE DEPENDS FOR ITS FINANCIAL SUPPORT ON VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS A DOZEN OR MORE GENTLEMEN DEEPLY INTERESTED SUBSCRIBE ANNUALLY SUMS FROM IOO TO 500 BUT THE COMMITTEE DEPENDS CHIEFLY ON REGULAR ANNUAL MEMBERSHIP WHICH COMPRISES SUSTAINING MEMBERS PERSONS CONTRIBUTING 25 OR MORE AND ASSOCIATE MEMBERS PERSONS CONTRIBUTING 2 OR MORE THESE SUBSCRIBERS TO THE NUMBER OF NEARLY 3000 HAVE ENROLLED AS ANNUAL CONTRIBUTORS THUS MANIFESTING THEIR SYMPATHY IN THE WAGING OF WAR AGAINST THE EVILS OF CHILD LABOR I TRUST THAT ALL THOSE PRESENT AND THOSE ABSENTEES WHO ARE INTER I 5THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY ESTED IN THE WORK OF THE NATIONAL CHILD LABOR COMMITTEE WILL ENROLL THEMSELVES AS MEMBERS THEREBY HAVING THE PLEASURABLE SAT ISFACTION OF ANNUALLY CONTRIBUTING THEIR MITE TO THE SAVING OF CHILD LIFE AND KEEPING OPEN IN THIS FAIR LAND OF OURS THE DOOR OF OPPOR TUNITY FOR EVERY CHILD THE WORK OF THE SOCIETY CAN BE MORE EFFECTIVELY INCREASED AND GREATER RESULTS CAN BE ACHIEVED IF IT COULD DEPEND ON AN ANNUAL INCOME OF IOOOO TO I5000 IN SURVEYING THE WORK ACCOMPLISHED BY THE NATIONAL CHILD LABOR COMMITTEE WE CAN HONESTLY AFFIRM THAT GREAT PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE GOETHE THE GERMAN POET AND PHILOSOPHER LAID DOWN THREE AXIOMS AS A TEST FOR THE VALUE OF ALL UNDERTAKINGS I WHAT DOES ONE PROPOSE DOING 2 IS IT WORTH DOING 3 HAS IT BEEN WELL DONE I THINK WE MAY FAIRLY CLAIM AFTER YOU HAVE LISTENED TO THE ABLE SPEAKERS WHO WILL ADDRESS YOU ON MANY INTERESTING SUBJECTS THAT YOU WILL SAY TO YOURSELVES THE WORK IS WORTH DOING AND HAS BEEN WELL DONE THE SUBJECT ASSIGNED TO ME THIS EVENING IS A PARTICULARLY AGREEABLE ONEDUTY OF A RICH NATION TO TAKE CARE OF HER CHILDREN THE SUBJECT IS A VAST ONE AND HOURS COULD BE PRO FITABLY EMPLOYED IN DISCUSSING THIS PROBLEM WHAT IS THE DUTY OF A WEALTHY NATION TO ITS WARDS TO WHAT EXTENT AND IN WHAT MANNER SHALL A NATION GUARD ITS WEAK SICK OR SUFFERING THERE MAY BE HONEST DIFFERENCES OF OPINION AS TO THE DUTY OF THE STATE OR THE NATION OR PRIVATE CAPITAL BEING ENLISTED TO ERECT HOSPITALS HOMES OR INSTITUTIONS BUT THERE CANNOT BE ANY DIFFERENCE OF VIEWS AS TO THE NECESSITY OF THE NATION PASSING SUCH LAWS AS WILL PRO TECT THE LIVES OF OUR TENDER CHILDREN WORKING IN ANY PATH OF LIFE I HAVE ALWAYS MAINTAINED THAT IN SPITE OF THE PRODIGALITY AND LIBERAL ITY OF OUR GOVERNMENT IN MANY DIRECTIONS IT HAS BEEN REMISS IN DOING SO LITTLE FOR THE NEEDY SICK AND POOR THE LARGE MAJORITY OF INSTITU TIONS THROUGHOUT OUR LAND HAVE BEEN ERECTED AND ARE MAINTAINED BY PRIVATE SUBSCRIPTIONS AND ENDOWMENTS IN ENGLAND FRANCE AND GERMANY IN FACT IN MOST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES THE ASYLUMS FOR THE YOUNG HOSPITALS CONVALESCENT HOMES AND SO ON ARE BUILT AND ARE CON DUCTED MORE LARGELY UNDER SUPERVISION OF THE GOVERNMENT THE PUB LIC IS NOT ASKED TO ERECT OR MAINTAIN SUCH HOMES IN OUR COUNTRY THE MAJORITY OF HOSPITALS CONVALESCENT HOMES INSTITUTIONS OF ALL I6DUTY OF RICH NATION TO CARE FOR CHILDREN KINDS ALTHOUGH FREQUENTLY AIDED BY STATE FUNDS MUST FIND THE WHERE WITHAL TO SUBSIST THROUGH PRIVATE CHARITY OPINIONS MAY DIFFER AS TO WHICH SYSTEM IS MOST PRODUCTIVE OF GOOD RESULTS BUT IT APPEARS TO ME THAT THE EUROPEAN SYSTEM IS SOUNDER AND WISER AND IS LESS LIABLE TO CRIPPLE THE USEFULNESS OF SUCH INSTITUTIONS AT TIMES WHEN THE COUNTRY SUFFERS FROM FINANCIAL DIS TURBANCES ALREADY GERMANYS POLICY IN ESTABLISHING THE OLDAGE PENSION SYSTEM HAS BEEN TAKEN UP BY FRANCE AND ENGLAND PERHAPS IN TIME SUCH A SYSTEM WILL BE FOLLOWED IN OUR OWN COUNTRY IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT IS THE PARAMOUNT DUTY OF THE STATE OR NA TION TO TAKE CARE OF OR AID THOSE WHO BY MISFORTUNE OR ACCIDENT ARE DISABLED FROM EARNING THEIR LIVING PRIVATE CHARITY SHOULD NOT BE CONTINUALLY CALLED UPON TO DO WHAT IS CLEARLY THE DUTY OF THE CITY STATE OR NATION THERE ARE MANY OTHER DIRECTIONS IN WHICH PRIVATE CHARITY CAN BE USEFULLY DISPENSED IF THE STATE OR CITY RELIEVED THE PUBLIC OF THE FINANCIAL BURDEN OF BUILDING REPAIRING AND MAINTAINING HOSPITALS AND INSTITUTIONS WE MUST REALIZE THAT THE SOCIALISTIC SPIRIT IS EVERYWHERE SPREADING WE HAVE LATELY SEEN IN MANY EUROPEAN COUNTRIES THE POLICY ADOPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT GIVING WORK AND DEVISING UNDERTAKINGS FOR THE UNEMPLOYED DURING TIMES OF DISTRESS CONCESSIONS ARE BEING CONTINUALLY MADE BY THE PARTY IN POWER MORE THOROUGHLY TO SATISFY THE MIDDLE AND POORER COMMUNITY IF THE GOVERNMENT FEELS THE NECESSITY OF GIVING WORK TO THE POOR IS IT NOT MORALLY BOUND TO MAINTAIN THOSE UNABLE TO WORK  THE NATURAL LIBER ALITY OF THE AMERICAN TO DEVOTE HIS MEANS OR PRIVATE FORTUNE TO SOME USEFUL END AND HIS PROMPT CHIVALRIC AND SUBSTANTIAL ANSWER TO THE APPEALS FROM THE POOR AND NEEDY HAVE APPARENTLY STIFLED THE GOVERN MENTS STATES OR CITYS READINESS TO PERFORM ITS CLEAR DUTY IN DOING ITS SHARE IN PROPER RELIEF IT IS TRUE THAT THERE ARE QUITE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THAT CHARITIES AND RELIEF OF THE AGED INFIRM AND SUFFERING CAN BE MORE EFFECTUALLY MANAGED BY PRIVATE CHARITIES THAN THROUGH THE DIRECT INSTRUMENTALITY OF THE STATE I WILL CONCEDE THAT IN MANY INSTANCES PRIVATE MANAGEMENT MAY PROVE MORE SATIS FACTORY BUT THE SPECTACLE OF SOME HOSPITALS AND INSTITUTIONS BEING FORCED TO CLOSE THEIR DOORS OR RESTRICT THEIR USEFULNESS FROM WANT OF FUNDS IS DEPLORABLE SUCH A CONDITION OF AFFAIRS CANNOT OCCUR ABROAD UNDER STATE CONTROL HOWEVER YOUR VIEW OF THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE FOR THE RELIEF OR PROTECTION OF THE ADULT MAY DIFFER FROM MINE I AM SATISFIED THAT THERE CAN BE NO DISSENTING VOICE AS TO THE IMPERA 17THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY TIVE DUTY AND MORAL OBLIGATION OF A NATION AND IF RICH THE GREATER THE OBLIGATION TO GUARD AND WATCH ITS YOUNGER CHILDREN AND SUR ROUND THEIR TENDER LIVES WITH SUCH SAFEGUARDS AS WILL BETTER PROTECT THEIR HEALTH AND LIVES THUS DOING ITS SHARE TO ENABLE THEM IN TIME TO BECOME HONEST DECENT AND USEFUL CITIZENS OMITTING FROM THE DISCUSSION THE OBLIGATION OF THE STATE AND NOT PRIVATE CHARITY TO ERECT AND MAINTAIN ORPHAN ASYLUMS PRO TECTORIES FOR CHILDREN HOMES FOR LITTLE WAIFS THERE IS THE OVERPOWER ING MORAL DUTY OF THE STATE AND NATION TO PASS LAWS TO REGULATE THE NUMBER OF HOURS OF EMPLOYMENT FOR CHILDREN SAY UNDER SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE AND TO PREVENT THEM FROM WORKING IN OCCUPATIONS DIS TINCTLY HURTFUL TO THEIR HEALTH AND MORALS AND TO PROHIBIT ABSOLUTELY ANY CHILD UNDER FOURTEEN YEARS OF AGE BEING EMPLOYED FOR WAGES THE VARIOUS STATES THROUGH THE MINISTRATION AND INSPIRATION OF THE NATIONAL CHILD LABOR COMMITTEE ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THIS HU MANE AND NOBLE TASK WE HAVE NOW TWENTYSIX STATE AND LOCAL CHILD LABOR COMMITTEES WHOSE EFFORTS ARE COORDINATED AND SUPPLEMENTED BY OUR NATIONAL COMMITTEE AND WE ARE CONSTANTLY RECEIVING APPEALS FROM MANY STATES TO AID THEM IN SECURING BETTER LAWS FOR THE COM ING YEAR THESE ARE ENCOURAGING SIGNS IT SHOWS THAT PUBLIC INTEREST AND SYMPATHY IN THIS GREAT WORK HAVE BEEN AWAKENED DO YOU REALIZE THAT ONE IN EVERY TWENTY OF ALL THE CHILDREN IN THE COUNTRY FROM THE AGE OF TEN TO SIXTEEN YEARS IS WORKING IN A FACTORY COAL MINE TRADE OR TRANSPORTATION MAILY OF THEM SLAVING IN THE NIGHT IN GRIMY WORKSHOPS IN BIG CITIES DEPRIVED IN MOST CASES OF ELEMENTARY EDUCATION AND FORCED IN MANY INSTANCES TO ASSOCIATE WITH VILE AND EVIL COMPANIONSHIP  THESE ARE THE CRYING EVILS WHICH THE NATIONAL CHILD LABOR COMMITTEE IS TRYING TO RECTIFY AND THESE ARE THE EVILS WHICH OUR NATION MUST SUPPRESS MANY DIFFICULTIES ARE ENCOUNTERED IN LOCATING AND ASCERTAINING THE SOURCE OF THE EVILS THE OWNERS OF FACTORIES EMPLOYING CHILD LABOR ARE IN MANY CASES LOATH TO GIVE INFORMATION AND EVEN THE PARENTS OF THE CHILDREN WORK ING IN UNDESIRABLE OCCUPATIONS AND SURROUNDINGS FALSIFY THE AGES OF THEIR CHILDREN IT HAS BEEN HUMOROUSLY SAID THAT A FACTORY CHILD PASSES FROM THE AGE OF ELEVEN TO THE PRESCRIBED AGE OF FOURTEEN YEARS WITHOUT ANY DUE REGARD TO THE GREGORIAN CALENDAR THE NATIONAL CHILD LABOR COMMITTEE HOPES TO SECURE AT AN EARLY SESSION OF CONGRESS THE PASSAGE OF A BILL FOR A FEDERAL CHIL DRENS BUREAU THE OBJECT OF THE BILL BEING TO INVESTIGATE QUESTIONS I8DUTY OF RICH NATION TO CARE FOR CHILDRENZ OF INFANT MORTALITY THE BIRTH RATE PHYSICAL DEGENERACY JUVENILE DE LINQUENCY AND JUVENILE COURTS DESERTION ILLEGITIMACY EMPLOYMENT OF CHILDREN IN DANGEROUS OCCUPATIONS AND ALL LEGISLATION BEARING ON THE HEALTH EFFICIENCY CHARACTER AND TRAINING OF CHILDREN THIS WILL AFFORD THE COMMITTEE AND THE PUBLIC VALUABLE INFORMATION AND AM MUNITION TO COPE BETTER WITH THE EVILS OF CHILD LABOR CHILD LABOR MEANS MORAL IMPAIRMENT AND PHYSICAL DESTRUCTION AND IT IS THE DUTY OF THE STATE TO PROTECT THE TENDER CHILDHOOD AND NOT ALLOW THE YOUNG LIVES TO BE SACRIFICED AT THE ALTAR OF GREEDY EM PLOYERS OR EVEN BY SELFISH PARENTS AS HAS BEEN NOBLY SAID  THE CHILD MEANS MORE TO THE COMMUNITY THAN ANY MATERIAL GAIN I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT WHEN WE HAVE ESTABLISHED IN ALL THE STATES OF THE UNION PROPER AND RESTRICTIVE LAWS TO SAVE CHILD LIFE WE SHALL HAVE ACCOMPLISHED A GREAT ACHIEVEMENT KIPLING HAS TRULY SAID THAT WE MUST TEACH PEOPLE TO LIVE BEFORE WE TEACH THEM TO LEARN WHEN WE AS A NATION HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THIS BENEFICENT END WE SHALL HAVE CONFERRED ON OUR COUNTRY A LASTING BLESSING AND SHALL HAVE LEFT TO GENERATIONS TO COME A NOBLE LEGACY WHEREOF WE MAY JUSTLY FEEL PROUD GIVE US YOUR WARM SYMPATHY AND ACTIVE SUPPORT AND WE PLEDGE YOU THAT WE WILL NOT SHRINK OR RETIRE FROM THE BATTLEFIELD UNTIL WE HAVE WON THE FIGHT I9

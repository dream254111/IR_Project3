perseverance The only account of it yet received is contained in the simple narrative of the gentlemen who con ducted this expedition which was with much kinclness immediately communicated to the Geographical Society by the Governor of the lIudsons Bay Company Fort Norman 5th September 1837 HONOURABLE SIRSWe have now the honour to report the complete success of the expelition this susnmer to the westward of Mackenzies River Our arrangenlents up to the leparture of the expedition from Fort Chipewyan were stated in full to Governor Simtson and the Northern Council who no doubt communicated them to your Honours we shall therefore present a brief detail of our subse quent operations On the 1st June we quitted Fort Chipewyan with two small seaboats accompanied by a luggageboat and a party of hunters for Great Bear Lake xisited the salt plains and arrived at Great Slave Lake on the 10th where we were letained ly ice until the ilst The same cause prolonged our passage across that inland sea and having been for two days stopped by a strong contrary wind at the head of Mackenzies River it was the 1st July when we reached Fort Norman Our Indians cast up on the following day and the crews and cargoes were finally divided and arranged Our toatbuilder John Ritch received his instructions to pro ceed immediately with a fisherman two other labourers and the hunters to Great Bear Lake and at its northeastern extremity to erect our winterquartels and lay in a stock of provisions against our return from the coast We therl took our departure and on the 4th reached Fort Good Hope There we found an assem blage of ffare Indians and Loucheux The latter informed us that three of their tribe had been killed and a fourth severely wouncled by the Esquimaux in the preceding xnonth which at once put an end to our intention of procuring an interpreter from among them although several volunteered to accompany us in that capacity They at the same time earnestly cautioned us to beware of the treacherous arts of their enemies On the 9th July we reachel the ocean ly the most vvesterly mouth of the Mackenzie which Sir John Franklin sought for in vain It is situated in lat 68 49L N long 136 37 W and perfectly answers the de scription which the Esquimaux messengers gave of it to that officer when they came to apprise him of the intended attack by the lTountain Indians We had proceedel but a short distarlce to seaward when a party of nineteen men came oS to us from Tent Island We gave each of them a small present a practice which we continuedof he Recent Jrctic Discoveries throughout the voyage and employed our vocalJularies to the best of our alility and to their great surprise to explain the friendly feeling of the whites towards their tribe Being a lively and com municative people we in the course of the season acquired some facility in our intercourse with them and when words failed signs supplied their place so that we seldom experienced much diffi culty in making ourselves understood or in comprehending their meaning When indulged however they always became daring and excessively troublesome and they were ever on the lookout for plunler On this first meeting they made several unsuc cessful attempts in that way and it was no easy matter to induce them to return to their camp after we had finished our business with them They said they wished to accompany us to our encampment where they would have soon been joined by fresh parties and we had a shoal and langerous navigation lJefore us that night We therefore peremtorily ordered them back lout it was not until we fired a ball over their heads that they put about and paddled of A storm soon after arose but we made the land in safety the following morning at Shingle Point in lat 69 where we were detained until the 11th The thermometer had already fallen to 48 Fahr being 30 lower than on the evening we left the Mackenzie River antl instead of the bright and beautiful weather we enjoyed in our descent of that noble stream we were now doomed to travel in cold dense fogs which en velopel us during nearly the whole of our progress along the coast But although they perplesed and retarded us we never allowed them to arrest our course nor did we ever throughout the voyage encamp but when compelled to dv so by ice or contrary winds to which line of conduct may under Providence be ascribed the early andsuccessful accomplishment of our undertaking In the afternoon of the 11th July we reached Point Key where we were detained by a comact body of ice occupying Phillips Bay until the 14th There we were visited by another party of Esquimaux whose tents were pitched at no great distance from us They live in the country bordering on Babbage River and informed us that except when flooded by the melting of the mountain snows it is an insignificant stream not fifty yards in breadth of this we had ocular proof in a clear day on our return A handsome flora was collected in this neighbourhood Having found a passage through the ice in Phillips Bay we reached Herschel Island the same evening 14th July and had intercourse with other parties of the natives who were pretty numerous along this part of the coast We found on the island the skull of a whale eight feet in brealth and whalelJone is everywhere an article in extensive use among the natives especially for the making of their nets

at Barter Island and that we missed them on our return from the circumstance of their being then dispersed along the rivers lakes and in the skirts of the mountains hunting the reindeer From thence the coast turned suddenly of to the WNW It presented nothing to the eye but a succession of low banks of frozen mud The ice was heavy all along but there were rwarrow channels close to the shore the soundings on these averaged one fathom on sandy bottom In the evening we passed the mouth of a considerable riser which was named after William Smith Esq From thence for about six miles the coastline is formed of gravel reefs near the extremity of which at Point Pitt called after another member of your Honourable Board the land trenls more to the westward The ice lay much closer here numerous masses adhered to tile bottom under the water which obliged us to search for a passage out from the shore The night was dark and stormy and we were in considerable danger one of the rudders gave way but we at length eSected a landing on a place near an immense reindeer pound This was inge niously formed by the Esquimaux with double rows of turf set up on a ridge of grounl enclosing a hollow four miles by two the end farthest from the beach terminating in a lake into which the unsuspecting animals are driven and there despatched with spears The vegetalle soil in this vicinity was barely four inches in depth beneath which the clay was frozen as hard as rock so that our tent pickets could not be driven home The men had to go a gool mile to find a log or two of driftwood for fuel the scarcity of which essential article is doubtless the chief cause of the want of inhabitants along so great a portion of the coast We were detained at this place till the following afternoon 27th when the ice opening a little enalled us to resume our route It blew a cutting blast from the northeast and tlle salt water froze upon the oars anl rigging  Point Drew called after Richard Drew Esq seven miles distant from our last encampment is the commencement of a bay of consideralule size but extremely shal low and much encumlJered with ice in pushing through which the boats receivel several llows and we had on this as on many other occasions to admire their excellent workmanship To sea ward the ice was still smooth and solid as in the depth of a sun less winter At milnight ve reachel a narrow projecting point across which the peaks of some high icebergs appeared and were from a distance mistaken for lollges of the natises This point we namel  Cape George Simpson as a mark of respect for our worthy governor It was lestined to lze the limit of our boat na ngation for luring the four following days we were only alzle to advance as many miles The weather was foggy and dismallyof the

in lat 71 3t N long 154 26 W variation of the compass 42 E Under the above cireumstances Mr Thomas Simpson under took to complete tile journey on foot and accordingly started on the 1st of August with a party of five men They carried with them their arms some ammunition pemmican a small oiled can vas canoe for the crossing of rivers the necessary astronomical in struments and a few trinkets for the natives It was one of the worst days of the whole season anl the fog was so dense that the pedestrians were under the necessity of rigidly following the tortuous outline of the coast which for twenty miles formel a sort of irregular inland bay being guardel without by a series of gravel reefs the shore of wl1ich was almost on a level with the water and intersected by innumerable salt creeks through which they waded besides three considerable rivers or inlets which they traversed in their portable canoe They found at one place a great many large wooden sledges joined mrith whalebone anl strongly shol with horn wTHr Simpson conjectures that these vehicles were left there ly the western Esquimaux already spoken of on their eastward journey to be resumed again on their re turn when winter sets in The tracks of reindeer were erery where numerous Next day the weather improved and at noon the latitule 7 10 was observed The land now inclined to the southwest and continued very low muddy and as on the pre ceding day abounding in salt creeks whose waters were at the freezing temperature The party had proceedeel about ten miles when to their dismay the coast sualdenly turned off to the south ward forming an inlet extending as far as the eye could reach at the same moment they descried at no great distance a small camp of the western Esquimaux to which they immediately directed their steps The men were absent hunting and the women and chillren took to their boats in the greatest alarm leaving behind them an infirm man who was in an agony of fear A few words of friendship removed his apprehensions and brought back the fugitives who were equally surprised and klelighted to behold white men They set before the party fresh reindeer meat and sealoil and besought them for toleacco tawaccah of which men women and even children are inordinately fond Mr Simpson now determined to adopt a more expeditious mode of travelling and apzlied for the loan of one of their  oomiaks or family canoes to convey the party to Point Barrow with which from a chart drawn ly one of the most intelligent of the women it appeared that these people were acquainted The request was Q

one shore is just visible from the other in the clearest weather It noxv again llew strongly from the northeast bringing back the cold dense fog but the traverse was eff8ected by ail of the compass The waves ran high and the skin boat surmountel them with a buoyancy which far surpassel tllat of our boastel north canoes The party encamped on the west side of the inlet The banks there were of frozen mud ten 01 twelve feet high the country within was erfectly flat aboundel in small lakes and produced a very short grass but nowllere hal the thaw penetrated more than two inches be neath the

the coast trenxled Inore westerly for ten miles until the party canle to what appearel a large bay where they stopped for two or three hours to await the clispersion of the fog not knowing which way to steer In the evening their wish was gratified and from that time the vea ther became comparatively fine Tlle bay was now ascertained to lJe only four miles in wilth the lepth half way across was one fathom and a half on a bottom of sanl that of Deases Inlet was afterwards found to be two fathoms mudtly lsottom being the greatest deth between Return Reef and Point Barrow es cet at ten miles southeast from Cal e Halkett where three fathoms on sanl were sounded on our return After crossing Mackenzies Bay the coast again trended for eight or nine miles to the WNW A compact body of ice extended all along and beyond the reach of vision to seaward but the party carriel their light vessel within that formilable barrier and male their way through the narrow channels close to the shore At mid night they passed the mouth of a fine eleep river a quarter of a mile wile to which Mr Siirlpson gave the naxne of rhe Bclle Vue and in less than an hour afterwards the rising sun gratifiel

ice has forced up into numerous mounds tllat viewed from a distance assume the appearance of huge boulder rocks At the spot where the party lalldel it is only a quarter of a mile across but is broader towards its termi nation rhe first oleject that presented itself on looking round the lanlingplace was an immense cemetery The bodies lay exposel in the most horrille and distusting manner anel many of them appeared so fresh that some of the men became alarmel that tlle cholera or some other dreadful disease was raging among the natives Two considerable camps of the latter stool at no great distance on the Point but none of the inmates ventured to approach till our party first visited them and with the customary expressions of friendship dissipated their apprehensions A brisk traffic then commenced after which the nomen forIned a circle and dancel to a variety of airs some of which were pleasing to the ear rhe whole conduct of these people was friendly in the extreme they seemed to be well acquainteel writh thc character if not the persons of white men were assionatelyfond of tobacco and when any of the younger people were too forward the seniors restrained them using the French phrase cest assez which like  tawaccah they must have learned from the Russian traders They designate the latter  Noonatagmun ancl a respectable looking old man readily took charge of a letter addressed ly Mr Simpson to them or to any other whites on the western const con taininb a brief notice of the proceedings of the expedition To the northwarl enormous icelzergs covered the ocean but on the western side there was a fine open channel which the Esquimaux assured the party extendel all along to the southward anl so in viting was the prospect in that lirection that hael such been his object Mr Simpson would not have hesitated a moment to pro secute the votage to Cooks Inlet in his skin canoe The natives informed him that whales were numerous to the northward of the Point and seals were everyxvhere sporting among the ice These Esquimaux were well clothed in seal and reindeer skins the men all usel mouth ornaments and the  tonsure on the crown of the heal was universal among both men and boys the women had their chins tattooed Iut did not wear the lofty topknots ofMessrs DEASE and SIMPSON s Account hair which are fashionable to the eastward They were very inS quisitive about the names of our party and equally communicative of their own A number o their worls were taken down some of which are diXerent from the corresponding terms given by Sir Edward Parry but the greater part are either the same or dissi milar only in their terminations They lay their lead on the ground with their heals all turnetl to the north There was nothing else either in their manners or habits remarked as differ ing from the wellknown characteristics of the tribe except an ingenious anal novel contrivance for capturing wild fowl It con sists of sis small perforatell ivory lJalls attached separately to cords of sinew three feet long the enels of which being tied to gether an expanding sling is thus formell which dexterously thrown up at the birds as they fly past entangles and larings them to the ground Mr Simpson could not learn that there had been any unusual mortality among this part of the tribe and is of opinion that the concourse of natives whe frequent Point Barrow at diSerent periods of the year couplel with the colulness of tlle climate sufficiently account for the numerous renlains already noticed It was lligh water between one and two oclock AM and PM the rise of the tide was fourteen inches anl the flood came from the westward Observations were obtained which determined the position of the landingplace to be in lat 71 2312 N  long 156 GO W agree ing closely with the observations of Mr Elson Then bidding adieu to their goodhumoured and admiring entertainers the party set out on their return They were arrested that evening by the ice but next morning August 5 it opened and allowed them to proceed At a late hour they reached the camp of the Esquimaux in Deases Inlet and after liberally recompensing them for the loan of their canoe directed some of the men to follow to Boat Extreme where it woukl be left for thexrl Then continu ing their route all night at five AM on the 6th the party rejoined the main body of the expelition We commenced our return the same afternoon and being fa voured by a light wind anl an almost open sea mTe sailed all night and next day Aug 7 at noon reached Cape Halkett We then steered across Harrisons Bay the wind increasing to a gale we shipped much water but persevering under treble reefed sails at three P M  of the Sth lre landed safely at  Fawn River within view o the point where our survey com mencel The position of this encampment was ascertainel by gool observations to be in lat 70 2a N long 148 iS W The gale having moderated we reembarked the following after noon and running without intermission before afresh breeze weof the lBecent Jrctic Discoveries reached Demarcation Point to lJreakfast on the 11th Several showers of snow fell during this run and it was piercingly clld The RomanzoW and British mountains had assumed the early livery of another winter The ice in Camlen Bay was still very heavy but it protected us from the dangerous swell to which we became exposed after passing Barter Island Soon after leaving Demarcation Point the ice became so closel7 wedged that we coud no longer purslle our way through it The following day August 12 it opened a little and the weather becoming fine we put out and advanced for a few hours when the mountainous swell and heavy ice obligel us to seek the shore which we reached with some difficulty between Backhouse River and Molant Cony beare There we were detained until the 15th The icebergs which begirt the coast were of great size and of every imaginable shape but from the summit of a hill six miles inland we had an unbounded prospect of the blue ocean stretching to the north The pasture in the leep valleys among the mountains was luxuriant hercls of reindeer were browsing there and we procured some venison In the night of the 14th the stars and aurora borealis were first visible The following morning we resumed our route and the weather continuing nearly calm we reached the western mouth of tlle AIackenzie on the 1 7th and there encamped The first Eskimaux seen during our return from Boat Extreme were at Beaufort Bay but from thence to the vicinity of the Mackenzie we vwTere continually faling ill with small parties snany of whom we had seen on the outward voyage We lnaintained a friendly intercourse with them all and they were very anxious to know whether we were soon to visit them again The habitations on Tent Island were abandoned in consequence we understood of an alarm that the Loucheux meditated a descent to revenge the murder of their friends We have but few general remarlis to add to the foregoing nar rative The tides all along the coast were semidiurnal the flood coming from the westward The rise however was strongly aSected by the winds and iee and our opportunities of observing were but few At Boat Ixtrenle the average rise was fifteen inches high water from one anl to two oclock AM and PM The rise generally lecreased to the eastwarl and at Point Kay it vfas only eight or nine inches That the main sea is clear and naxi gable by ships during the summer months the long rolling swell we encountered on our return and the view obtained from the mountains furnish tolerable proof We likewise saw some whales on our return The prevalence of east alld northeast windg during the early part of the summer is a remarkable fact We were indeed favoured by a westerly wind for five dtays Ot1 our2S4 IesSIs 1EAS13 and SIMPSON s 4ccou7Xt return but this was almost the only exception At a more ad vanceel eriod of he season howelrer the winds blew more from the west and

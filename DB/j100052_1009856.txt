AMONG STUDENTS OF EDUCATION AND AMONG SOCIAL WORKERS AND OTHER OBSERVERS OF INFLUENCES WHICH AFFECT HUMAN CHARACTER THAT MANY OF THE DEFECTS WHICH CHAR ACTERIZE OUR SOCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL INSTITUTIONS AND MANY OF THE DEFECTS WHICH SO MAR HUMAN CHARACTER ITSELF ARE TRACEABLE TO A MISTAKEN CON CEPT AS TO WHAT SHOULD BE SOUGHT IN LIFE IMPLANTED IN US BY OUR TEACHERS AND UNTIL RECENTLY EMPHASIZED QUITE UNIVERSALLY IN OUR EDU CATIONAL SYSTEMS THE SCHOOLS OF THE PAST AND MOST OF THOSE OF TODAY HAVE DEVOTED THEMSELVES TO THE TASK OF GIVING CHILDREN SUCH KNOWL EDGE AS WOULD ENABLE THEM TO ENGAGE SUCCESSFULLY IN THE CUSTOMARY VOCATIONS AND PERSONAL SUCCESS HAS BEEN THE GOAL EVER HELD BEFORE THE YOUTHFUL MIND UNTIL RECENTLY IT APPEARS TO HAVE ESCAPED PUBLIC NOTICE THAT THIS CONSTANT EMPHASIS UPON THE IMPORTANCE OF PERSONAL SUCCESS UNLESS SAFEGUARDED BY SUITABLE ETHICAL TRAINING TENDS SUBTLY TO THE DEVELOP MENT OF SELFISH PROPENSITIES THAT LEAD THE INDIVIDUAL TO DISREGARD OR SUBORDINATE THE INTERESTS OF OTHERS IN THE FURTHERANCE OF PERSONAL ENDS AND THAT LEAD TO UNSOCIAL ATTITUDES AND TO UNFRIENDLY RIVALRIES AND ILLFEELINGS AND TO WRONGDOINGS OF EVERY KIND THE CONSTANT ENCOURAGEMENT GIVEN TO PERSONAL AMBITION FOR PERSONAL TRIUMPH AND PERSONAL REWARD TENDS TO DEVELOP A DESIRE SIMILAR TO THAT POSSESSED BY THE CRIMINAL OFFENDER WHO IN SEEKING HIS PERSONAL GRATIFICATION GIVES NO PROPER REGARD OR CONSIDERATION TO THE RELATION OF HIS ACTS OR OF HIS COURSE TO THE WELFARE OF OTHERS OR TO THE WELFARE OF THE COM MUNITY TO THE DESIRE FOR PERSONAL ADVANTAGE OR GRATIFICATION REGARDLESS OF THE WELFARE OF OTHERS OR REGARDLESS OF THE WELFARE OF THE SOCIAL WHOLE NEARLY ALL AND PERHAPS ALL EVIL IS DUE AND FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS DESIRE IN THE FORM OF PURELY SELFCENTRED AMBITIONS THE TEACHERS OF CHILDREN WHETHER IN THE SCHOOLS THE HOMES OR THE STREETS HAVE BEEN IN LARGE MEASURE RESPONSIBLE THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTEREST IN ONE ANOTHER IS PERHAPS AS IMPORTANT AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTEREST IN SELF IF GREED AND INJUSTICE ARE TO BE PREVENTED AND IF JUSTICE AND FAIRDEALING ARE TO PREVAIL IT HAS BECOME EVIDENT THAT THE IMPOR 457THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY TANCE OF DEVELOPING THE SOCIAL NATURE OF THE CHILD HAS BEEN INSUFFI CIENTLY CONSIDERED THE DEVELOPMENT OF SELFISH TENDENCIES MUST BE FORESTALLED AND PREVENTED BY THE AWAKENING OF SOCIAL INTERESTS AND OF THE SPIRIT OF FAIRNESS AND RIGHT AND THROUGH AWAKENING RECOGNITION ON THE PART OF EACH OF THE CONSIDERATION DUE HIS NEIGHBOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE DESIRABLE ATTRIBUTES AND ATTITUDES CAN BE FURTHERED BY DEVELOPING WIDER FRIENDSHIPS AND THROUGH THE WIDER SHARING OF COMMON PLEASURES JOYS AND OCCUPATIONS AS WHOLESOME COMMON INTERESTS ARISE THE SOCIAL NATURE DEVELOPS AND WITH IT THE SPIRIT OF FAIRPLAY AND EQUITY WHEN WE ENJOY THINGS TOGETHER OR COOPERATE GLADLY WITH ONE ANOTHER WE FOR THE TIME BEING SHARE SIMILAR THOUGHTS AND EMOTIONS AND THE MORE OFTEN WE SHARE SIMILAR THOUGHTS AND EMOTIONS THE MORE UNIFIED IN THOUGHT AND FEELING WE BECOME AS COMMON INTERESTS ARISE AND AS THE SOCIAL NATURE AWAKENS THE INDIVIDUAL BECOMES UNWILLING TO TAKE UNFAIR ADVANTAGE OF HIS NEIGHBOR AND PERSONAL AMBITIONS BECOME SO DE VELOPED OR READJUSTED AS TO BE CONFORMABLE TO THE PUBLIC WELFARE AND AS TO CONDUCE TO HARMONY AND PROGRESS IT IS WHEN WE THINK AND FEEL BY AND FOR OURSELVES ALONE THAT INJUSTICE SPREADS AND WITH IT THE ILLFEELING AND BITTERNESS THAT SEPARATE PEOPLE FROM ONE ANOTHER AND THAT DEVELOP GROUP ANTAGONISMS THAT SPREAD DISCORD AND DISORDER THE OPPORTUNITIES WHICH THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS CAN PROVIDE FOR THE AWAKENING OF SOCIAL INSTINCTS AND SOCIAL INTERESTS AND FOR THE AROUSING OF SOCIAL SPIRIT AND FOR THE LAYING OF FOUNDATIONS FOR HEALTHY SOCIAL RELATIONS ARE SO VAST THAT IN THE LEADING CITIES OF THE COUNTRY MOVE MENTS ARE ALREADY WELL ADVANCED LOOKING TO THE EXTENSION OF THE FUNCTIONS OF THE SCHOOLS UNTIL THEY BECOME EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS IN A FAR BROADER SENSE THAN HITHERTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOCIAL NATURE IS NO LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INTELLECTUAL FACULTIES EDUCATION OF THE HEAD IN DISREGARD OF THE MORAL OR SOCIAL SENSE LEADS TO THE GROSSEST CRIMES AND TO THE MOST FARREACHING INJUSTICE THERE IS PERHAPS NO OTHER FORM OF IMMORALITY MORE DIS ASTROUS IN ITS EFFECTS UPON THE INDIVIDUAL AND UPON THE COMMUNITY THAN INTELLECTUAL SELFISHNESS NEARLY EVERY EVIL OF WHICH SOCIETY AND THE INDIVIDUAL ARE VICTIMS IS TRACEABLE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO SELFISH ACTS THAT THE MERE INTELLECT OF THE OFFENDER EXCUSES INTELLECT DIVORCED FROM THE SOCIAL NATURE IS A DANGEROUS TOOL THE MIND 458 50PUBLIC SCHOOLS AS SOCIAL CENTRES SWAYED BY RAMBLING PASSIONS MAKES THE SOUL AS HELPLESS AS THE BOAT WHICH THE WIND LEADS ASTRAY UPON THE WATERS BHAGAVAD GITA II THE SOCIAL NATURE MUST BE SO DEVELOPED AS TO AVAIL OF THE MIND FOR THE FURTHERANCE OF HUMAN WELFARE AND MUST NOT BE DRIVEN BACKWARD BY IT CRIMINALITY HAS BEEN INSTANCED AS A FAR TOO PREVALENT CONSE QUENCE OF SELFISH DESIRE OF DESIRE FOR SATISFACTION OR GRATIFICATION REGARDLESS OF THE INJURIES ENTAILED POVERTY IS IN LARGE MEASURE DUE TO SICKNESS OR VICIOUS HABITS BUT IN STILL LARGER MEASURE TO INEQUITABLE INDUSTRIAL CONDITIONS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT THROUGH THE EXERCISE OF SELFCENTRED DESIRES FOR PERSONAL WEALTH REGARDLESS OF THE INTERESTS OR DF THE WELFARE OF MANY OF THOSE ENGAGED IN ITS PRODUCTION VICE AND VICIOUS HABITS ARE BUT PRODUCTS OF SELFCENTRED DESIRES FOR IMMEDIATE GRATIFICATION REGARDLESS OF CONSEQUENCES WHETHER TO SELF OR TO OTHERS SICKNESS CAN BE TRACED IN MOST CASES EITHER TO UNSANITARY OR OTHERWISE DEFECTIVE ENVIRONMENT OR TO NEEDLESSLY IMPOVERISHED CONSTITUTION THE LATTER BEING CONSEQUENT EITHER UPON THE ENVIRONMENT OR ELSE UPON IGNORANCE OF THE LAWS OF HEALTH AND BLIND UNHYGIENIC STRIVING FOR LIFE AND ITS GRATIFICATION ON THE PART OF THE INDIVIDUAL OR HIS PROGENITORS EVEN UNHYGIENIC ENVIRONMENTS ARE USUALLY DUE TO THE SELFISHNESS OF INDIVIDUALS OR TO THEIR INDIFFERENCE TO THE WELFARE OF OTHERS INDIVIDUALS OWN THE SLUMS AND ANTAGONIZE REMEDIAL LEGIS LATION DESIGNED TO SECURE BETTER TENEMENT CONDITIONS OR TO ELIMINATE CENTRES OF PHYSICAL OR MORAL FOULNESS AND INFECTION IT IS INDIVIDUALS WHO PERPETUATE EVIL CONDITIONS AND PERMIT OTHER INDIVIDUALS TO SUFFER AND DIE FOR THE SAKE OF THE PROFITS TO BE DERIVED BY SELF FROM THE CONTINUANCE OF THE CONDITIONS THE PERPETUATION OF BAD ENVIRONMENTS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF DEFECTIVE CONSTITUTIONS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE HUMAN SELFISHNESS OR INDIFFERENCE THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR BOTH CAN OBVIOUSLY BE PREVENTED BY THE DEVELOPMENT THROUGH SCHOOL INFLUENCES AND OTHERWISE OF SOCIAL INSTINCTS AND OF REGARD ON THE PART OF EACH FOR HIS FELLOW AND BY PROPER SOCIAL COOPERATION IN SUPPORT OF REMEDIAL SANITARY AND INDUS TRIAL MEASURES AND OF MEASURES DESIGNED TO ELIMINATE FROM OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS OR TO BRING UNDER ADEQUATE CONTROL THOSE INFLU ENCES IN THE SCHOOLS WHICH TEND TO MAKE THE INDIVIDUAL SELFCENTRED AND PREDOMINANTLY SELFSEEKING TO LIVE AND TO PRODUCE AND TO ENJOY IN WAYS CONFORMABLE TO THE PUBLIC WELFARE AND CONDUCIVE TO 459 5ITHE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY HUMAN PROGRESS SHOULD BE THE AIM OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE REALIZATION SHOULD BE AWAKENED IN EACH THAT IT IS ONLY THROUGH THE SOCIAL LIFE AND THROUGH PERSONAL SERVICE TO OTHERS THAT THE HIGHEST WELFARE OF THE INDIVIDUAL HIMSELF CAN BE ATTAINED IN THE INTEREST OF ORDINARY MORALITY IT IS DESIRABLE THAT THE SOCIAL INSTINCTS OF THE PEOPLE BE GIVEN ADEQUATE OPPORTUNITY FOR EXPRESSION IN WHOLESOME WAYS IT IS NATURAL FOR PEOPLE TO DESIRE RECREATION AND PLEASURE SOME DEGREE OF RECREATION AND PLEASURE IS PERHAPS ESSENTIAL TO HEALTH AND TO CHARACTER AND IT IS NATURAL FOR MEN AND WOMEN AND FOR BOYS AND GIRLS TO DESIRE TO ASSOCIATE TOGETHER IN MANY DISTRICTS AND COMMUNITIES OPPORTUNITIES FOR HARMLESS ENJOYMENT ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN WHERE OPPORTUNITIES FOR DECENT PLEASURES CANNOT BE FOUND INDECENT PLEASURES WILL BE HAD IT IS NEITHER REASONABLE NOR JUST TO DENOUNCE VICE AND ITS VICTIMS WHERE OPPORTUNITIES FOR WHOLE SOME ENJOYMENT AND FOR WHOLESOME RELATIONS BETWEEN BOYS AND GIRLS AND BETWEEN YOUNG MEN AND YOUNG WOMEN ARE ALTOGETHER LACKING IF WE WOULD FORESTALL THE DEVELOPMENT OF VICIOUS HABITS AND OF THE UNSOCIAL ATTITUDES THAT LEAD TO WRONGDOING OF EVERY KIND WE MUST SEE TO IT THAT OPPORTUNITIES ARE PROVIDED THAT SHALL MAKE POSSIBLE THE ENJOYMENT OF A WHOLESOME SOCIAL LIFE THE MOVEMENT LOOKING TO THE USE OF SCHOOLS AS SOCIAL CENTRES FOR THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS IS OF BUT A FEW YEARS GROWTH THE MOVEMENT IN NEW YORK STARTED OR FIRST RECEIVED CONCRETE EXPRESSION ABOUT SEVEN YEARS AGO IN 1897 MISS WINIFRED BUCK OF THE UNIVERSITY SETTLEMENT SECURED PERMISSION TO OPEN SOME BOYS CLUBS IN PUBLIC SCHOOL NO 20 AND IN ORGANIZING AND SUPERVISING THE EXPERIMENT HAD THE COOPERATION OF A NUMBER OF THE MEMBERS OF ONE OF THE OLDER BOYS CLUBS OF THE SETTLEMENT TWO YEARS LATER SIMILAR CLUBS WERE OPENED IN PUBLIC SCHOOL NO I6O AND GRADUALLY THE MOVEMENT HAS SPREAD TO VARIOUS PARTS OF THE CITY UNTIL AT PRESENT TWENTYONE OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL BUILDINGS ARE OPEN AFTER SCHOOL HOURS UNDER SUITABLE RESTRICTIONS AND SUPERVISION FOR THE USE OF BOYS AND GIRLS CLUBS AND FOR OTHER FORMS OF YOUTHFUL SOCIAL LIFE OR RECREATION IN 128 OF THE BUILDINGS LAST YEAR FREQUENT INFORMAL LECTURES ON POPULAR TOPICS ILLUSTRATED WITH STEREOPTICON VIEWS WERE GIVEN TO ADULTS IN THE EVENINGS AND IN SEVERAL SCHOOLS VERY SUCCESSFUL CONCERTS AND MUSI CALES WERE GIVEN ALSO THE POPULARITY OF THESE FEATURESWHICH WERE BOTH RECREATIONAL AND EDUCATIONAL IN NATUREIS ATTESTED BY THE VERY 460 52PUBLIC SCHOOLS AS SOCIAL CENTRES LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO AVAILED OF THEM THE AGGREGATE ATTEND ANCE AT THE INFORMAL LECTURES LAST YEAR AMOUNTED TO 12042I I IN ONE OF THE LARGER SCHOOL BUILDINGS P S NO I47 ACCOMMO DATIONS WERE PROVIDED LAST YEAR FOR SEVENTYSIX BOYS AND YOUNG MENS CLUBS THIRTYSIX OF THESE GIVING CONSIDERABLE TIME ON MEETING NIGHTS TO LITERARY EXERCISES OR TO DISCUSSIONS OF TOPICS OF INTEREST THE REMAIN ING FORTY BEING ORGANIZED FOR PURPOSES OF SOCIAL FELLOWSHIP IN ATHLETICS IN PUBLIC SCHOOL NO I60 TWENTYFIVE CLUBS WERE IN SESSION AND THERE THE EXCEEDINGLY INTERESTING EXPERIMENT WAS SUCCESSFULLY TRIED OF ORGANIZING ONE OF THE REGULAR EVENING SCHOOL CLASSES INTO A CLUB THE MEMBERS MEETING AS A SCHOOL CLASS FOUR NIGHTS IN THE WEEK AND AS A CLUB FOR SOCIAL PURPOSES THE FIFTH NIGHT THAT SCHOOL AND VARIOUS OTHERS WERE OPEN BUT FIVE NIGHTS A WEEK IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT SIMILAR EXPERIMENTS WILL BE TRIED ELSEWHERE FOR AFTER ALL MERE INSTRUCTION IN THE ELEMENTARY BRANCHES OF LEARNING CONSTITUTES BUT A POOR AND DEFECTIVE KIND OF EDUCATION THE MERE INCULCATION OF FRAG MENTARY KNOWLEDGE DOES NOT NECESSARILY DEVELOP THE QUALITIES THAT LEAD TO GOOD CITIZENSHIP OR TO USEFUL LIFE FOR THE MEMBERS OF A SCHOOL CLASS TO ORGANIZE AS A CLUB TO MEET ONE EVENING EACH WEEK FOR GAMES OR WHOLESOME RECREATION OF ANY KIND AND FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF CLOSER INTIMACIES AND SYMPATHIES THAN THE FORMALITIES OF THE CLASS ROOM USUALLY ALLOW AND FOR THE COMMON ENJOYMENT OF THE THOUSAND AND ONE INTERESTS THAT SUCH CLUBS AROUSEALL THIS TENDS WHOLESOMELY TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOCIAL NATURE AND TO THE FAVORABLE DEVELOP MENT OF CHARACTER FROM THE STANDPOINT OF MERE ECONOMY IT IS DESIRABLE THAT THE SCHOOL BUILDINGS BE NOT LEFT IDLE AND UNUSED THROUGHOUT THE MAJORITY OF THE DAY IT WAS FOUND IN NEW YORK LAST YEAR THAT THE AMOUNT OF TIME DURING WHICH THE SCHOOL BUILDINGS WERE IN USE DAILY AVERAGED LESS THAN FIVE HOURS THE VAST CAPITAL INVESTED IN LANDS BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENTS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES LAY IDLE AND UNPRODUCTIVE DURING MORE THAN TWOTHIRDS OF THE TIME BETWEEN EIGHT IN THE MORNING AND TEN AT NIGHT AND MEANWHILE THE SETTLEMENTS AND VARIOUS CLUB BUILDINGS IN MANY PARTS OF THE CITY WERE OVERWHELMED WITH REQUESTS FROM ORGANIZED AND UNORGANIZED GROUPS OF PEOPLE FOR THE USE OF THEIR ROOMS FOR SOCIAL AND RECREATIONAL PURPOSES AND FOR MEETINGS TO DISCUSS MATTERS OF SPECIAL LOCAL INTEREST THE UNIVERSITY SETTLEMENT ALONE WITH SIXTY OR MORE CLUBS AND SIMILAR ORGANIZATIONS IN ITS BUILDING 46I 53THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY WAS OBLIGED LAST YEAR TO REFUSE REQUESTS FROM MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED OTHER GROUPS FOR PERMISSION TO USE ITS ROOMS THE DESIRE FOR SOCIAL LIFE AND FOR LARGER SOCIAL RELATIONS HAS ARISEN ON EVERY HAND SHALL THIS DESIRE BE THWARTED AND DISCOURAGED AND COMPELLED TO SEEK EXPRES SION AMID THE DEMORALIZING CONDITIONS THAT CHARACTERIZE CHEAP DANCE HALLS AND SALOONS OR SHALL THE SCHOOL BUILDINGS THAT ARE IDLE AND UNUSED DURING THE LATTER PART OF THE AFTERNOONS AND USUALLY DURING THE WHOLE OF THE EVENINGS BE MADE AVAILABLE AFTER SCHOOL HOURS FOR OTHER SOCIAL USES OF THE PEOPLE IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT THE STRUCTURAL ARRANGEMENTS IN A SCHOOL BUILDING ARE SUCH AS TO RENDER IT AS A RULE UNSUITED FOR ORDINARY SOCIAL USES THE DESKS AND CHAIRS ARE SCREWED TO THE FLOOR UGLY BLACKBOARDS COVER MUCH OF THE WALLS FURNITURE CANNOT EASILY BE INTRO DUCED THAT WILL BE SUITABLE FOR BOTH SCHOOL AND INFORMAL SOCIAL PUR POSES DOUBTLESS THE EQUIPMENT OF MANY SCHOOLS IS NOT OF A KIND TO RENDER THE SCHOOLROOMS CONVENIENT FOR ANY OTHER THAN MERE CLASS ROOM USE BUT IN OTHER SCHOOLS AND IN SOME OF THE BEST AND MOST SUCCESSFUL DESKS AND CHAIRS ARE BEING INTRODUCED OF SUCH PATTERNS THAT THEY CAN EASILY BE REMOVEDPUSHED OR CARRIED TO ONE SIDE BY THE PUPILS THEMSELVESAND THE FLOOR CLEARED FOR GAMES OR THE SEATS REARRANGED FOR LECTURES CONCERTS OR OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT WHERE FLOOR SPACE IS VERY LIMITED AND ORDINARY DESKS EVEN IF MOVED TO ONE SIDE OCCUPY TOO MUCH ROOM TO ADMIT OF LARGE AUDIENCES OR OF CONVENIENT DANCING OR OF SUCH LARGE GATHERINGS AS WOULD SOMETIMES BE DESIRED THE USE OF DESKS OF THE TYPE DEVISED BY COLONEL PARKER OF THE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION OF CHICAGO WOULD OFTEN AFFORD A SIMPLE WAY OUT OF THE DIFFICULTY DESKS OF THIS TYPE HAVE FLAT TOPS READILY ADJUSTABLE TO ANY INCLINATION DESIRED AND BROAD BASES AND SUITABLE RUBBERTIRED CASTORS THAT PERMIT SIDEWAYS MOTION ONLY SUCH DESKS CAN EASILY BE PLACED ONE UPON ANOTHER IF NECESSARY IN THE REAR OF THE ROOM OR ELSEWHERE OUT OF THE WAY THE PATTERN OF MUCH MODERN SCHOOL FURNITURE IS SO GOOD THAT ITS RETENTION IN THE CLASSROOM WOULD SELDOM BE FOUND TOO OBJECTIONABLE FROM THE AESTHETIC STANDPOINT EVEN THOUGH THE DESKS WERE OCCASIONALLY PLACED UPON ONE ANOTHER AS SUGGESTED OF COURSE FOR ORDINARY TABLE GAMES SUCH AS CHESS CARDS OR MANY OF THE SIMPLE GAMES THAT SO DELIGHT CHILDREN THE FLATTOP DESK IS AS WELL SUITED AS AN ORDINARY SMALL TABLE BY COMBINING THE USE OF EASILY MOVED FURNITURE WITH THE USE OF THE BETTER TYPES OF 462 54PUBLIC SCHOOLS AS SOCIAL CENTRES EASILY REMOVED PARTITIONS AS IS ALREADY DONE IN NUMEROUS SUCCESSFUL SCHOOLS A WHOLE FLOOR CAN BE CONVERTED QUICKLY AND EASILY INTO A LARGE ASSEMBLY ROOM IN MANY SCHOOLS ONE OR MORE ROOMS COULD ADVAN TAGEOUSLY BE SET APART REGULARLY AFTER SCHOOL HOURS FOR ORDINARY READINGROOM PURPOSES AND SUPPLIED WITH NEWSPAPERS MAGAZINES AND PERIODICALS THE BLACKBOARD DIFFICULTY I3 EASILY OVERCOME LARGE SHEETS OF GROUND GLASS AFFIXED TO THE WALLS THE UNGROUND BACKS OF THE SHEETS PAINTED ANY DARK SHADE OR TONE DESIRED AFFORD PERFECT SUBSTI TUTES FOR BLACKBOARDS AND ARE FAR MORE DURABLE AND NO LESS SERVICEABLE THE JUDICIOUS COLORING OF BLACKBOARDS AND WALLS AND THE INTRO DUCTION OF SUITABLE PICTURES AND INEXPENSIVE CASTS AND PERHAPS SOME PLANTS OR SIMPLE FLOWERS AND THE SUBSTITUTION OF NEW FOR OLD TYPE FURNITURE WILL MAKE THE ROOMS AS ATTRACTIVE AS ORDINARY SOCIAL USAGE REQUIRES AS SCHOOL ROOMS BECOME MORE ATTRACTIVE AND AS THE SCHOOLS FUNCTIONS BROADEN AND AS THE BUILDINGS BECOME MORE LARGELY SOCIAL CENTRES FOR THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS THE ANTAGONISMS SO OFTEN EXISTING BETWEEN SCHOLARS AND SCHOOL DIMINISH AND TRUANCY LESSENS AND THE DIFFICULTY OF INTERESTING CHILDREN IN THEIR SCHOOL WORK BECOMES REPLACED BY THE FAR GREATER DIFFICULTY OF PROVIDING ADEQUATE ACCOMMODATIONS FOR ALL WHO EAGERLY SEEK ADMISSION THE MODERN SCHOOL WITH ITS SOCIAL FEATURES IS EAGERLY SOUGHT BOTH IN WINTER AND IN SUMMER BOTH FOR LESSONS AND FOR PLAY DURING THE SUMMER VACATION LAST YEAR IT WAS NO UNCOMMON THING IN ONE OF THE NEW YORK SCHOOLS TO SEE FRONM I200 TO I500 CHILDREN SWARMING UP SIX FLIGHTS TO THE ROOF IN THE EVENINGS TO PLAY THEIR SIMPLE GAMES THERE OR TO DANCE TO THE SIMPLE MUSIC AND FREQUENTLY MOTHERS AND FATHERS WOULD TRUDGE UP THE LONGS STAIRS TOO MANY OF THEM CARRYING THEIR BABIES TO WATCH THE ENJOYMENT OF THE CHILDREN AND TO PARTICIPATE WITH THEM IN THEIR HAPPINESS SURELY IT IS A GOOD THING WHEN THE PARENTS AND CHILDREN OF A NEIGHBORHOOD HAVE OPPOR TUNITY TO ENJOY REST AND RECREATION TOGETHER IN THE CROWDED DIS TRICTS ESPECIALLY SUCH WHOLESOME RELATIONS BRING PEACE AND HAPPINESS AND GOODWILL THE MORE WIDELY SUCH AND SIMILAR OPPOR TUNITIES ARE PROVIDED THE BETTER WILL IT BE FOR THE COMMUNITY AND FOR THE HARMONY AND WELFARE OF ALL J G PHELPS STOKES UNIVERSITY SETTLEMENT NEW YORK CITY 463 55

3 XVII Observations on the Measurement of three Degrees of the Meridian conducted in England by Lieut Col William Mudge By Don Joseph Rodriguez Communicated by Joseph de Mendoza Rios Esq F R S Read June 4 1812 THE determination of the figure and magnitude of the earth has at all times excited the curiosity of mankind and the his tory of the several attempts made by astronomers to solve this problem might be traced to the most remote antiquity But the details of the methods pursued by the ancients on this subject being extremely vague and their results expressed in measures of which we do not know the relation to our own in fact give us very little assistance in learning either the figure or dimensions of our globe It was not till the revival of science in Europe that the two great philosophers HUYGHENS and NEWTON first en gaged in the consideration of this question and reduced to the known laws of mechanics the principles on which the figure of the earth should be determined They demonstrated that the rotatory motion should occa sion differences in the force of gravity in different latitudes and consequently that parts of the earth in the neghbourhood of the equator should be more elevated than those near the poles The most simple hypothesis which first presented itself toDon J RODRIGUEZS Observations on the their imagination was that which supposed the earth to be throughout composed of the same kind of matter and its sur face that of a spheroid generated by revolution round its axis This hypothesis adopted by NEWTON only as an approximation to the truth is in fact perfectly consistent with the equilibrium to which particles in a state of paste or of tardy fluidity would arrive in a short time after their present motion was impressed and the eccentricity derived from this hypothesis is at least not very remote from that which actually obtains in the pre sent state of consistence and stability which the earth has since acquired But the homogeneity of the matter of which the earth con sists is at variance with all geological observations which prove evidently that at least 50oo toises of the exterior crust is formed of an immense mass of heterogeneous matters vary ing in density from each other and upon the supposition of a state of fluidity of the whole it should follow that the strata should successively increase in density from the surface to wards the centre that the more dense would accordingly be subjected to less of centrifugal force and consequently that the spleroidical form resulting from this cause would be less eccentric than would arise from a state of perfect homoge neity The most simple as well as the most effectual means of verifying the hypothesis respecting the figure of the earth is to measure in the two hemispheres several arcs of its meri dians in different latitudes at some distance from each other On this subject it must be allowed that the Academy of Sciences at Paris set the example in giving the original im pulse to the undertaking and not only commenced but putMeasurement of three Degrees of the Meridian 32 in execution those parts of the plan which were most difficult and most decisive The results of the first measurements made of different arcs on the meridian of different parts of the world were found to be perfectly conformable to the expectations of HUYGHENS and of NEWTON and also with experiments made on the vibration of the pendulum in different latitudes and they left no doubt that the earth was in fact flattened at the poles establishing thereby one point extremely interesting in natural philosophy These results however did not correspond with sufficient accuracy for ascertaining with precision the degree of eccen tricity or even the general dimensions of the earth as might naturally be expected when we consider the necessary imper fection of the means then employed in these operations and the great difficulties that are to be encountered For the purpose of making a nearer approximation to the true dimensions of the earth and of verifying former mea surements it is necessary in some instances to repeat them and also to make others in different situations which may be expected to be improved in proportion to the progress that is made in the means of perfecting the several departments of science At the commencement of the French revolution men of science took advantage of the general impulse which the hu man mind received in favour of every species of innovation or change and they proposed making a new measurement of an arc of the meridian in France for the purpose of establishing a new system of weights and measures which should be per manent as being founded on the nature of things342 Don J RODRIGUEZS Observations on the A commission composed of some of the most distinguished members of the Academy of Sciences was charged to form the plan of these operations which were to serve as the basis of the new system They invented new instruments new methods new formulx and in short almost the whole of this important undertaking consisted of something new in science Two celebrated astronomers DELAMBRE and ME HAIN were engaged to perform the astronomical and geodetical observa tions and these they continued as far as Barcelona in Spain The details of their operations observations and calculations were subsequently examined by a committee of men of science many of whom were foreigners collected at Paris who con firmed their results and by the sanction of such an union of talents gave such a degree of credit and authenticity to their conclusions as could scarcely be acquired by other means Since that time in the year 1806 Messrs BIOT and ARAGO members of the National Institute were sent into Spain for the express purpose of carrying on the same course of opera tions still further southward from Barcelona as far as For mentera the southernmost of the Balearic islands Fortunately this last undertaking which forms a most satisfactory sup plement to the former was completed by the month of May 1808 at a period when political circumstances would not ad mit of any further operations being pursued as a means of verifying the results by measuring a base which should be independent of those formerly obtained in France In the year 180o the Swedish Academy of Sciences encou raged by the success of the operations conducted in France sent also three of its members into Lapland to verify their former measurement taken in 1736 by new methods and byMeasurement of three Degrees of the Meridian the use of new instruments similar to those which had recently been used in France and of which the National Institute made a handsome present to the Swedish Academy The results of this new undertaking which terminated in 180g were drawn up by M SVANBERG and are highly interesting by their ex actness by the perspicuity of the details and even a certain degree of novelty given to the subject by the arrangement adopted by the learned author M SVANBERG These new measures were found to confirm in a remark able manner the general results of those which had preceded and gave very nearly the same proportion for the eccentricity and other dimensions of the globe so that there would not have remained the smallest doubt respecting the figure of the earth being flattened at the poles had there not been a fourth measurement performed in England at the same time as that undertaken in Lapland the results of which were entirely the reverse This measurement which comprised an arc of 2 5o was undertaken by Lieut Col MUDGE Fellow of the Royal Society with instruments of the most perfect construction that had ever yet been finished by any artist contrived and executed for that express purpose by the celebrated RAMSDEN The details of the observations and other operations of Lieut Col MUDGE may be seen in the volume of the Philosophical Transactions for the year 1803 and one cannot but admire the beauty and perfection of the instruments employed by that skilful observer as well as the scrupulous care bestowed on every part of the service in which he was engaged Bengal lights were employed on this occasion as objects at the several stations and their position appears to have been determined with the utmost precision by thetheodolite of RAMSDEN which MDCCCXII U u 325Don J RODRIGUEZS Observations on the reduces all angles to the plane of the horizon and with such a degree of correctness that the error in the sum of the three angles of any triangle is scarcely in any instance found to exceed three seconds of a degree and in general not more than a small fraction of a second Accordingly the geodetical observations were conducted with a degree of exactness which hardly can be exceeded and even if we suppose for a moment that the chains made use of in the measurement of the bases may not admit of equal precision with the rods of platina employed in France never theless the degree of care employed in their construction in the mode of using them and the pains taken to verify their measures was such that no error that can have occurred in the length of the base could make any perceptible difference in the sides of the series of triangles of which the whole ex tent does not amount to so much as three degrees Nevertheless the results deduced by the author from this measure alone would lead to the supposition that the earth instead of being flattened at the poles is in fact more elevated at that part than at the equator or at least that its surface is not that of a regular solid For the measures of different degrees on the meridian as reduced by Lieut Col MUDGE increase progressively toward the equator The following table of the different measures of a degree in fathoms is given by the author in his Memoir Latitude 52 50 30 60766 52 38 56 60769 52 28 6 60794 S2 20 Qo 6082o SS6Measurement of three Degrees of the Meridian 327 Latitude 51 51 4 60849 51 25i 18 60864 51 13 18 60890 51 2 54 60884 The singularity of these results excites a suspicion of some incorrectness in the observations themselves or in the method of calculating from them The author has not informed us in his Memoir what were the formulae which he employed in the computations of the meridian but one sees by the arrange ment of his materials that he made use of the method of the perpendiculars without regard to the convergence of the me ridians and although this method is not rigorously exact it can make but a very few fathoms more in the total arc and will have very little effect on the magnitude of each degree It is therefore a more probable supposition that if any errors exist they have occurred in the astronomical observations But it is scarcely possible to deteimine the amount of the errors or in what part of the arc they may have occurred excepting by direct and rigorous computation of the geodetical measure ment I have therefore been obliged to have recourse to cal culations which I have conducted according to the method and formulae invented and published by M DELAMBRE The means generally employed for finding the extent of a degree of the meridian consists in dividing the length of the total arc in fathoms by the number of degrees and parts of a degree deduced from observations of the stars but if these observations are affected by any error arising from unsveadi ness of the instrument from partial attractions or from atny other accidental causes then the degrees of the meridian will Uu2l8 Don J RODRIGUEZS Observations on the be affected without a possibility of discovering such an error in this mode of operating It is consequently necessary in such a case to employ some other method which may serve as a means of verifying the observations themselves of de tecting their errors if there be any or at least of shewing their probable limits My object therefore is to communicate the result of calcu lations that I have made from the data published by Lieut Col MUDGE in the Philosophical Transactions and I hope to make it appear that the magnitude of a degree of the meridian corresponding to the mean latitude of the arc measured by this skilful observer corresponds very exactly with the results of those other measurements that have been above noticed In M DELAMBRES method nothing is wanting but the sphe rical angles that is to say the horizontal angles observed corrected for spherical error Moreover for our purpose we have no occasion for the numerical value of the sides of the series of triangles but only for their logarithms Thus the logarithm of the base measured at Clifton as an arc gives us that of its sine in feet or in fathoms so that by means of this latter logarithm and the spherical angles of the series of tri angles we obtain at once and as easily as in plane trigonome try the logarithms of the sines of all their sides in fathoms After this it is extremely easy to convert them into loga rithms of chords or of arcs for the purpose of applying them to the computation of the arcs on the meridian or azimuths I give the preference to taking the logarithms of the sides as arcs because the computations become in that case much more simple and expeditious Near to Clifton which is the northern extremity of the arcMeasurement of three Degrees of the Meridian 329 in a situation elevated 35 feet above the level of the sea a base was measured of 263427 feet in length the chains being supposed at the temperature of 62 FAHRENHEIT or 13 REAUMUR For reducing this base to toises we have the proportion of the English foot to that of France as 4 4263 so that if pbe taken to express the fractional part of the French foot corres ponding to English measrre then log p  99723446587 and then log of 263427  44go6602860 and hence the log of the base in toises will be found equal to 36148536943 and the number of toises corresponding is 41195 taken at the same temperature which corresponds to 162 of the centigrade thermometer This base we must consider as an arc of a circle and it is easy to reduce it to the sine of the same arc according to the method given in a note at the end of this memoir The logarithm of the sine of the base in toises is found to be 361485358oo With this quantity as base and by means of the spherical triangles given by Lieut Col MUDGE in his paper I have found the logarithmic sines in toises of all the sides of his series of triangles and have subsequently reduced them to logarithmic arcs of the same which enable me to complete the rest of the calculation With these we may compute any portions of the meridian or successive intervals of different stations expressed in toises and in parts of the circle or their respective azi muths having regard always to the relative convergence of different meridians The author has made observations for determining the lati tude of the two extremities of his arc and has also determinedDon J RoDRIGUEZSz Observations on the the azimuths of the exterior sides in his series of triangles by means of the greatest elongation of the pole star In the calculations that I have made I began at Clifton in Yorkshire the northern extremity of the arc and for this purpose the following are the data furnished by Lieut Col MUDGE Latitude of Clifton reduced to the centre of the station 53 27 3662 Azimuth of Gringley seen from Clifton and reckoned from the north toward the west 256 17 25 Azimuth of Heathersedge seen from Clifton and reckoned in the same direction 18 8 881 With these data and the two tables of spherical triangles and the logarithms of their sides expressed in arcs the inter vals between Clifton and the two stations Gringley and Hea thersedge were found in toises and in seconds of a degree as well as all the corrections to be made on the first azimuths increased by 180 as azimuths of Clifton seen on the horizon at these latter places The same process was continued for the following stations in succession all the way to Dunnose in the Isle of Wight which is the southernmost extremity of the series In this manner we have the latitudes and azimuths of each station by means of two or three preceding stations and con sequently we have a verification of all the calculations that have been before made by Lieut Col MUDGE The results of my calculations are contained in the two fol lowing tables So30Measurement of three Degrees of the Meridian 833 First Table of Distances in Toises and in Seconds of a Degree on the Meridian comprised

tables we have for measures of the entire arc comprised between the stations of Clifton and Dunnose the following quantities 16205732 toises and 10221972 seconds of a degree or 20 50 21972 By dividing the former of these by the second we get the measure of a degree corres ponding to the mean latitude of the whole arc equal to 5707374 toises or 6082654 fathoms at the temperature of 161 of the centigrade thermometer the latitude being 52S I 20 The station at Arbury Hill happens to be very nearly in the meridian of Clifton and Dunnose and divides the interval between them into nearly equal parts The measures of that part of the arc which lies between Arbury and Dunnose is by the tables 9167947 toises and 978334 seconds or i36 2334 of the common division of the circle The mean lati tude of the arc is 51 25 21 And the measure of 1 degree corresponding to it is 5706841 toises In the same manner the measure of the arc comprised be tween Arbury Hill and the northern extremity at Clifton is 7037785 toises and 443863 seconds or 10 1 5863 Its mean latitude is 52 50 32 And we have for one degree of the meridian corresponding to this latitude 5708070 toises Hence if we divide the entire arc into two equal parts we deduce the following values of a degree corresponding to the middle of the whole and of its parts Latitudes 51 25 20 O 57068 52 2 20 57074 52 50 30 57o81 33st4easurement of three Degrees of the Meridiain 333 These values are as appears perfectly in conformity with the theory and with the results of other measures that have been taken in different parts of the northern hemisphere but in order to place that agreement in a more distinct point of view I shall show how nearly these estimates agree with the elliptic hypothesis by comparing them with those measures of a degree on which we can place the greatest reliance for exactness Now if we compare the results of these calculations with those deduced by Lieut Col MUDGE from his observations we shall see the probable source of those errors which it appears to me have led him to false conclusions It has already been observed that the station at Arbury Hill divides the whole arc into two parts nearly equal and that it is also nearly in the meridian of the two extremities at Dunnose and Clifton It was in all probability this circumstance which determined the author to observe the latitude of Arbury Hill as he would then have two partial arcs independent of the whole and of each other For determining the angular extent of these arcs Lieut Col MUDGE observed the zenith distances of several stars on the meridian above the pole by means of a large zenith sector constructed by RAMSDEN with the same pains that he had bestowed upon the theodolite Lieut Col MUDGE paid all possible attention and took all such precautions as might na turally be expected from an observer of his experience and address Nevertheless the results of his observations made on different stars differ no less than 4 seconds from eacl other But by taking a mean of all the dimensions of the three arcs reduced to the centre at each station are as follows IMDCCCXI  X x334 Don J RODRIGUEZS Observations on the Between Clifton and Dunnose 2 50 235 Clifton and Arbury 1 14 3 40 Arbury and Dunnose i 36 19 95 The extent of the first arc in linear measure is 1o36339 feet English and when this is reduced to toises we have for the lengths of the three arcs from Lieut Col MUDGES mea sures From Clifton to Dunnose 162o673 Clifton to Arbury 7038o2 Arbury to Dunnose 916871 These last values exceed those resulting from my compu tations the first by 0 toises the second by 2 the third by 8 toises and these differences arise from the convergence of the meridians which the author thought might safely be neg lected and in fact it does not make a difference that is percep tible in the value of a degree upon the meridian For the difference of 8 toises in the distance between Dunnose and Arbury makes but 5 toises difference in the value of a degree upon that arc and the difference of o1 in the whole distance from Dunnose to Clifton makes 3j in the measure of each degree on that arc So that as far as this source of disagree merit is concerned the authors results and mine would not be found to differ materially from each other But if we attend to the angular dimensions of the several arcs as deduced from observation and from calculation these will not be found to agree so nearly The following table will shew the differences in each in stanceMeasurement of three Degrees of the Meridian 2f 50 23 85 observed Clifton and Dunnose 0 23 observed 2 50 21 97 calculated Difference  1 38 l 14 It 84o observed Clifton and Arbury 1 4 4 observed 1 13 58 63 calculated Difference  4 77 r 1 36 1995 observed Arbury and Dunnose 36 1995 obeed 36 23 34 calculated Difference  39 These differences are really considerable and are capable of producing important errors in the results dependent on them In the first place we see that the southernmost arc between Dunnose and Arbury is smaller than it would appear by com putation by as much as 34 and when this deficiency is combined with an excess of 8 toises in the linear dimensions of the same arc it makes as much as 40 toises difference in the estimated length of a degree The reverse of this occurs in the northern portion of the arc comprised between Clifton and Arbury Hill This is larger than it ought to be by 477 and hence the value of a degree on the meridian turns out too small by about 62 toises in its linear dimensions Fortunately however the excess of the total arc is extremely small as it does not exceed 138 so as to make but 5 or 6 toises differ ence in the length of a degree observed on the meridian and corresponding to the mean latitude of the arc examined XxDon J RODRIGUEZS Observations on the From what has been above stated it seems almost beyond a doubt that it is to errors in the observations of latitude that the appearance of progressive augmentation of degrees towards the equator as represented by Lieut Col MUDGE in his paper are to be ascribed and that it is especially at the intermediate sta tion at Arbury Hill that the observations of the stars are erro neous nearly 5 seconds notwithstanding the goodness of the instruments and the skill and care of the observer But be fore I insist farther on this head I will answer one objection that may be made to the principles of the method that I have pursued in this Memoir Those astronomers who have hitherto undertaken the mea surement of degrees of the meridian have deduced their measures by simply dividing the linear extent by the nunmer of degrees and minutes found by observation of the fixed stars taken at the two extremities of the arc This is indeed the most simple that can be adopted and it has the advantage of being independent of the elliptic figure of the earth especially in arcs of small extent The elements dependent on this figure are too uncertain to be employed in calculating the angular intervals in the short distances between successive stations even as a means of verification without risk of com mitting greater errors than those to which astronomical ob servations can be liable Accordingly one cannot safely make any use of it in cases where great accuracy is required I must admit the justness of this objection and must there fore shew the extent to which it really applies to the present subject In the first place I may suppose that in consequence of some fault in the instrument with respect to vertical position 336MIeasurement of three Degrees of the Meridian construction or some accidental derangement there is an error of some seconds in the observations of the fixed stars How is this to be discovered  This is not to be done by com paring the value of a degree on the meridian as deduced from these observations with the results of other measurements in distant parts of the globe For if we find that these degrees so taken do not agree in giving the same ellipsoid we are not to attribute all the differences to irregularities of the earth without supposing any error on the part of the observer of his instrument or of other means employed in his survey But this in fact is what has generally been done It must however be acknowledged that the majority of observers have not been in fault as they could do nothing better but too much reliance has been placed on the goodness of their instruments their means and other circumstances It is true that irregularities of the earth and local attractions may occa sion considerable discrepancies which are even inevitable but before we decide that these are the real source of disagree ment we ought carefully to ascertain that there are no others But to return to our subject of the English measurement If the uncertainty which yet subsists with respect to the exact figure of the earth and its dimensions occasions some small errors in the calculation of the series of triangles the sum of these errors will be found in the estimate of the entire arc and will increase in proportion to the extent of the arc mea sured Now in the English measurement we find exactly the reverse of this For the difference between the results of calculation and observation is only 138 on the whole arc but is even as high as 477 on one of the smaller arcs So that whatever error we may suppose to have been introduced 337Don J RoDRIGrEzZs Observations on the into the calculation by assuming a false estimate of the sphe roidity d o ifthea r heor of thr elements employed in the

computation and of observations of the fixed stars It appears therefore that these elements are by no means to be neglected as a method of verification and in fact the quantity of 38 is so small that it is extremely dif ficult to ascertain this quantity with the very best instruments Of this we shall find further proof hereafter but as this dis cussion is not without its use I shall enter into some details on this subject The measurement in Lapland was performed by means of a double metre and with a repeating circle of BOnDA sent by the National Institute of France In order to see to what degree of accuracy the arc computed would agree with that obtained by observations of the pole star above and below the pole I assumed an oblateness of 7 and as logarithm of radius I had 65147500 expressed in toises and in round num bers With these elements and with the data to be found in the work of M SVANBERG we have by the western series of triangles 584o196 and 584o138 by the eastern So

toises excess in the linear extent One can never depend upon quantities so small as this so that the agreemtent between the results of computation and actual observation proves not only the skill of the observers and the accuracy of which their in struments admit but also that the elliptic elements employed in the calculation are a sufliciently near approximation to the truth to be deserving of confidence In the 8th volume of the Asiatic Researches published by the Society at Calcutta are contained the details of another measurement performed in 1802 by Major WILLIAM LAMB TON in Bengal on the Coromandel coast In this undertaking which was executed with great skill and attention Major LAMBTON employed Bengal lights as signals chains for the linear measures and a theodolite and a zenithsector made by RAMSDEN The base measured was 6667740 fathoms reduced to the level of the sea and to the temperature of 62 FAHRENHEIT and the stations were so chosen that four of the sides of the triangles were almost in the same line and nearly parallel to the meridian at the southern extremity of the arc so that their sum but little exceeds its whole extent The lengths of these arcs in fathoms reduced to the meridian are thus given in the Memoir of Major LAMBTON AB so75813 north latitude of A 1 1 44 559 BC 17481245 CD 2223704 north latitude of E 13 19 49ol8 DE 3524643 From these

the meridian at the extremity A 60861noo fathoms or 571065 toises Now these values are precisely what we find on the elliptic hypothesis with an oblateness of 320 or 30 and in short the correspondence between the hy pothesis and the measures of Major LAMBTON is as complete as can be wished Major LAMBTON indeed finds the degree on the perpendicular too great by 200 fathoms but this arises from a mistake in his calculation Lastly I shall apply the same method and see how nearly the elliptic hypothesis agrees with tile last measures taken in France which merit the highest degree of confidence both with respect to the observers who have executed it and the means which they had it in their power to employ I have taken only the arc between Dunkirk and the Pantheon at Paris from the data published by the Chevalier DELAMBRE in the 3d Vol of the Measurement of the Meridian I employed the same elements and similar calculations to those made on the English arc The oblateness of  3 gives the difference between the parallels equal to 7883615 seconds by the east ern series of triangles and 7883617 by the western series The mean of these 7883616 may be taken as the true extent of the total arc The two other elements give for this quantity 788362t 342Measurement of three Degrees of the Meridiazn M34 nd 7883493 or 9 11 136 nd 349 as the calculated extent of the arc But the arc observed was  11 1983 according to M DELAMBRE and 2 11 2085 according to M MECHAIN so that the least difference between the cal culation and the observations will be 264 M DELAMBRE is of opinion that the latitude of Dunkirk which is sup posed to be 51  90 should be diminished and in fact the distance between the parallels of Dunkirk and Green wich which is 252419 toises gives by the mean of the three assumed ellipticities 6 323 for the difference of latitude After deducting this quantity from 51 28 4 the supposed latitude of Greenwich there remains 51 2 77 or 8 for that of the tower at Dunkirk If from this again we deduct the calculated arc 2 11 235 we have 48 50 445 for the latitude of the Pantheon while according to the observations of M DELAMBRE it is 4937 or 4835 by those of M ME CHAIN If various circumstances with regard to unfavourable weather and also others of a different kind connected with the revolution and of which M DELAMBRE complains with much reason have occasioned some uncertainty with respect to the observations at Dunkirk still the numerous observa tions made at Paris both by him and by M MECHAIN at a more favourable season and in times of perfect tranquillity render the supposition of an error of 4 seconds in the latitude of the Pantheon wholly inadmissible It is however too true that such errors are possible and it is only by careful perse verance and by repeated verification that they are to be dis covered and removed as we have seen to be highly probable with respect to the station at Arbury Hill But the same celebrated observer M MECHAINwho handled YyN44 Don J RIODRIGUEZS Observations on the instruments with great delicacy and was possessed of peculiar talents for this species of observation has given us an instance of singular irregularity in the observations made at Montjui and at Barcelona The latitude of Montjui determined by a very long and regular series of zenith distances is full g24 less than that deduced from a similar series of observations made at Barcelona with the very same instruments and with equal care Moreover there is reason to think from other obser vations that the latitude of Barcelona which is supposed to be 45 ought to be diminished still one second so that the difference between the observations at Montjui and at Barce lona will probably amount to as much as 4 Local attractions are supposed to have been the cause of this irregularity but then the latitude as deduced from observations made at Bar celona should have been less than it appeared by those made at Montjui itself for the deviation of the plumbline or of the spirit contained in a level could only be occasioned by the little chain of land elevated to 1o0 or i30 toises which passes to the north of Barcelona in a northeasterly direction Now since the deviations arising from this source would be north ward the zenith distance of circumpolar stars would be aug mented by that deviation and consequently the latitude deduced therefrom would be diminished by just so much But here the contrary occurs for the latitude of Montjui deduced from the observations at Barcelona is 4823 whilst that obtained by direct observations at Montjui is only 145 Hence it seems probable that the cause of tlis irregularity must be sought elsewhere and that it is not likely to be discovered without repeating over again the same observationsMeasurement of three Degrees of the Meridian 45 Moreover it does not follow that the latitudes of two places are correct because the declinations of the stars deduced from them correspond for the deviations caused by local attrac tions or from any other source are made to disappear in cor recting the declination but remain uncorrected in the latitude of each LieutCol MUDGE is also of opinion that the irregularity in the value of his degree may be ascribed to deviation of the plumb line occasioned by local attractions This is certainly very possible and may be decided by an examination of all circum stances on the spot But if there be really an error of 1 in the extent of the whole arc this should rather be ascribed to some defect in the observations themselves than to any ex traneous source for the observations of different stars give results that differ more than 4 seconds from each other I shall now conclude this Memoir by expressing a wish which men of science in England have it more in their power than any others to gratify I mean by making new measure ments in the southern hemisphere Those whichl have been made hitherto in the northern hemisphere are extremely sa tisfactory by their agreement and give us great reason to presume that the general level of the earths surface is ellip tical and very regularly so and hence we might expect the opposite hemisphere to be equally so and to be a portion of the same curve Nevertheless the degree measured at the Cape of Good Hope by LACAILLE in latitude 33i 8 appears to indicate an ellipse of less eccentricity or of greater axis for the linear extent of 57037 toises corresponds to the mvea sure of a degree in latitude 47 47 in the northern hemisphere If now we calculate the arc as before with an oblateness ofDon J RODRIGUEZS Observations on thi 3  and with the sides of LACAILLES triangles reduced to tie meridian we find it greater by io than it was found to be by observations of the stars An error of io seconds by an astronomer so skilful and scrupulous as LACAILLE is too ex traordinary to be admitted as probable It is true that there was a greater error well ascertained to have occurred in the measurement in Lapland amounting to 13 seconds but the academicians engaged in this undertaking were by no means equally conversant with observations as LACAILLE There remains therefore but one method of removing all doubt on this subject and this is to repeat and verify the mea surement at the Cape and if possible to extend it still farther to the north The same Major LAMBTON who has succeeded so well in Asia and is in possession of such perfect instru ments for the purpose would be singularly qualified for a similar undertaking in Africa and would furnish us with a measurement in the other hemisphere as much to be relied upon as the former He would have the glory of deciding two important questions by his own observations first the similarity and magnitude of the two hemispheres and se condly the degree of reliance to be placed on the elliptic hypothesis It might be still further desirable if other measurements could also be undertaken either in New Holland or in Brazil for though neither of these countries differs much in latitude from the Cape of Good Hope they are so remote in longitude that a correspondence of measures so taken would nearly establish the similarity of all meridians S46Measurement of three Degrees of the Meridian 347 Note I shall now explain the formulae employed in deducing the results to which I have come in the foregoing Memoir The demonstration of them is to be found in the work of M DE LAMBRE on the Meridian In the first place let a be the radius of the equator e the ec centricity 4 the latitude of one extremity of a side or arc in any series of triangles and 0 the azimuth of that side The radius of curvature of this arc will be expressed by I  I  cos J cos s  i el an   1 I I e  sin 4    and    i R R a Hence we see that R is the radius of the arc at right angles to the meridian One may in general neglect the azimuth and take the last radius for the radius Ri Now in compu ting the arc between Clifton and Dunnose I have supposed the oblateness to be  or e 3 and log a 5147200 expressed in toises expressed in toises The latitude of the southern extremity of the base is the same as that of Clifton and its azimuth if we choose to attend to it is nearly 335  This base considered as an arc of a circle is reduced to its sine by the formula E  log e u Ks K being the modules of the table of logarithms so that log K  96377843 By means of the logarithmic sine of the base and the angles  IDon J RoDRIGUEZS Observations on the of the triangles considered as spherical the logarithmic sines of the sides in the series were next computed and then reduced to logarithms of the arcs themselves by the formula K  sin log  log sin e  6  For the purpose of making this last reduction it is sufficient to take a single value of R corresponding to the mean lati tude of the entire arc 5 2 20 It was thus that the table was formed of logarithmic sides considered as arcs Let m be one of these arcs and let us represent by 34 and  its value reduced to the meridian the one in toises the other in seconds of a degree and we shall have the following formulae  mIsco   tamsin  g   sinO mcos 0 4 mcos  2R

If P be put for the difference of longitude between two points distant by an arc which measures m we have sin P sin m  sin 6    m K I m to 1   sin min0 log sin m  log R  KR   log si   sin P a48Measurement of three Degrees of the Meridian 349 The arc of the meridian between Greenwich and For mentera is so fortunately situated that its middle point is in latitude 45 Its whole extent measures 12 48 44 and the distance between the parallels in linear measure was found to be 7304307 toises Hence the mean degree correspond ing to the latitude of 45 41 18 is 570105 toises and if we multiply this number by go we get onefourth part of the meridian of the earth The correction to be deduced for oblateness is 58 59 or 61 toises according as it is assumed to be 3 j0 or 3O and if we take the mean of these we have the fourth part of the meridian Q  5130886 toises and hence the metre 44330867 lines so that the value of the metre turns out to be almost entirely independent of the elliptical form of the earth The radius of the equator is derived from the expression log a  log   K  E     E3g being the oblateness and Xr the periphery of a circle  31416 In order to compare any degrees measured with those ob tained on the elliptic hypothesis we have a very simple for mula Let m and m be the values of two degrees on the meridian of which the mean latitudes are 4i and 2 in com paring the analytic expressions for these two degrees deve loping them and then making  45 we have m  m  1 p o cos o2  g cos 222 m 570105 toisesp 3 a  t e sin Io andg 4 sin 20n  e l   el andg e  si And then we shall find that the oblateness 2j gives 5707566 and 5719238 toises for the degrees in England and Lapland I shall here subjoin one reflection more which appears of MDCCCXII Z zDon J RoxMslGEzs Observations Xn the imrtportance The oblhteness of the earth is a quantity which varies considerably by the least difference in the elements on which it depends Accordingly it is not surprising that its value fluctuates between two proportions which differ sensibly from each other To illustrate this let p be the function which serves to determine the oblateness of the earth so that  I p When this equation varies  s   3p Now the coefficient ae being very great we see why the least variation in the elermens of the function p occsions so considerable a variation in the denominnator of the oblateness This is precisely what happens in the lunar equations depen dent won the figure of the earth anit which M LAPLACE has deduced from his beautiful theory Thus for example in the inequality that depends on the longitude of the moons node which he has determined analytically with so much precision the numerical coefficient found by BURG gives 30 for the oblateness but if this coefficient be diminished by o665 then the oblateness becomes 3 so that a variation even to this small amount in the coefficient augments the denominator of the oblateness nearly 2 part The same happens with regard to the pendulum vibrating seconds for supposing its length at 45 to have been cor rectly ascertained by M M BIOT and MATHIEU if we wish to know the length of a seconds pendulum at the equator corresponding to an oblateness ofro we find it to be 4391810 lines Now this length differs from that determined by Bou GUER only by 0029 of a line and M LAPLACE even thinks that the result of BOUGUER should be diminished by about double this quantity We see from hence how much these little differences whether produced by errors of observation s5oMeasurement of three Degrees of the Meridian SS3 or irregularities in the earth itself are liable to affect the de nominator of the fraction expressing the oblateness Fortunately it seems probable that the utmost latitude of our present uncertainty is between the limits of 330 and 310 and the mean of these may be considered as a very near ap proximation to the truth Z z B

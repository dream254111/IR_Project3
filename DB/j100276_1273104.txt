Rep 381 This decision is based on the doctrine of continuing nuisance the court arguing that because the buildings were frame and such as could readily have been removed by the use of modern machinery the nuisance could not be regarded as permanent The conclusion of the court seems to be unquest ionably in line with the present tendency to regard nuisances as continuing if possible This general tendency is shown in the cases of Schlitz Brewing Co v Compton 142 Ill 511 34 Am St Rep 92 32 N E 693 Mechems Cases on Damages p 134 Nashville v Comar 88 Tenn 415 12 S W 1027 7 L R A 465 Uline v Railway Co 101 N Y 98 4 N E 536 54 Am Rep 661 Mechems Cases on Damages 140 In these cases the courts have so enlarged the doctrine of continuing nuisance that it would be difficult to imagine a nuisance which all would hold to be permanent In Nashville v Comar supra the court says that no nuisance is permanent which may be removed by the expenditure of labor or money The Iowa court has formerly been regarded as adhering strongly to the doctrine of permanent nuisance and has gone farther perhaps than any other court in holding certain classes of nuisances as permanent See Powers v Council Bluffs 45 Iowa 652 24 Am Rep 792 Stodghill v Ry 53 Iowa 341 5 N W 495 Mechems Cases on Damages 128 Hodge v Shaw 85 Iowa 137 52 N W 8 39 Am St Rep 290 These cases apply the doctrine of Troy v Cheshire R Co 3 Fost 83 55 Am Dec 177 that a nuisance is permanent if it will remain without change from any cause but human labor Thus in Hodge v Shaw supra a brick building obstructing an easement was regarded as a permanent nuisance Although the court expressly denies the intention to question its previous decisions it is clear that the effect of the decision is to substantially modify the Iowa doctrine and it does not seem probable that the Iowa court will attempt to reconcile Hodge v Shaw with the principal case on the ground that in the one the building was composed of brick and in the other of lum ber See North Vernon v Voegler 103 Ind 314 and Hay v City of Lexing ton 1903  Ky  71 S W 867 MASTER AND SBRVANTLIABILITY OF PARTY FOR PROCURING BREACH OF CONTRACTPlaintiffs were owners of collieries employing about 100000 men most of whom were members of defendant Federation The men were paid according to amount and price of coal mined The speculation of inde pendent coal dealers resulted in depressions of the market and the consequent reduction of wages In order to restrict the production of coal and thus pro tect themselves against these middlemen the miners authorized the Federa tion to declare certain stopdays involving a breach of contract The Fed eration did so and the plaintiffs bring this action for damages Held that the Federation was not liable notwithstanding the damage sustained by the plaintiffs Glamorgan Coal Co v South Wales Miners Federation 1903 1 K B 118 The ground of the decision was the absence of malice and that the Federa tion was acting for the best interests of the men What constitutes justifica tion is an interesting question In Read v Friendly Society 1902 2 K B 732 ante p 594the defendant pleaded in justification a prior contract inconsist ent with that of employer Held no justification From the English cases it appears that justification is largely dependent upon motive damage suffered plus malicious intent of other party in general creating a cause of action In the principal case the breaking of the contract regardless of motive was an unlawful act The advice under the circumstances was almost equivalent to compulsion It seems reasonable to say that such conditions might give 602RECENT IMPORTANT DECISIONS as good a cause of action as where malice is present But late American cases are opposed to the English doctrine Brown Hardware Co v Ind Stove Works 1902 Tex Civ App  69 S W Rep 805 1 MICHIGAN LAW REV 333 MINIES AND MININGEXTRALATBRAI RIGHTSDEEDSCONSTRUCTION The owner of two adjoining mining claims deeded to plaintiff an irregularly shaped portion of one of them with end lines not parallel to those of the original claim and describedias a part of the Johnstown quartz lode mining claim Later he granted to the defendant all his interest in the remainder of this and the adjoining claim In a suit to enjoin defendants trespass Held that the injunction should be granted Montana etc Co v Boston etc Co 1902 Mont  70 Pac R 1114 The court says In determining the effect of these conveyances regard must be had    to the character of the property granted    The deed plaintiffs omits any reference to the veins or the dips spurs angles thereof but it is apparent therefrom that the parties were dealing with the property as quartz mining property that is a definite portion of the Johns town quartz lode mining claim  Hence the conclusion was that the plain tiff was entitled to extralateral rights as to all veins having their apices within the end lines of the conveyed portion and that such rights were bounded by planes drawn parallel to the end lines of the original location passing through the points where such veins cross the end lines of the portion conveyed Plaintiff in support of his claim cited Boston etc Co v Montana Co 89 Fed R 529 In this case Judge De Haven construing the same deed held that plaintiffs extralateral rights were bounded by planes parallel to the actual end lines of the conveyed portion which diverged from each other on the dip of the vein thus giving plaintiff much greater rights He cited in support of his position Richmond Min Co v Eureka

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW  TAXES AND LICENSESMandamus to compel the treasurer of the city of Auburn to place certain funds collected by the city under an ordinance at the disposal of the officers of the Auburn school district The question for the court to determine was whether the moneys collected were license moneys within the meaning of Art VIII Sec 6 of the constitution of Nebraska which provided All such fines penalties and license moneys shall be appropriated exclusively to the use and support of common schools in the respective subdivisions where the same may accrue Held that the moneys collected were taxes and the mandamus proceedings were dismissed State ex rel Auburn School Dis trict v Boyd 1902  Neb  89 N W Rep 416 58 L R A 108 The object of the ordinance was to impose an occupation tax on certain occupations or business By one section it was unlawful for any person to engage in certain occupations or business until he had paid the tax and the same was evidenced by a receipt Another section provided for penalties for the violation of the ordinance The majority of the court argued that inas much as it was clearly the intention to exercise the taxing power and as the municipality had such power the imposition was a tax even though the pay ment of the tax was made a condition precedent to the right to engage in these occupations They also contended that as the city charter provided for the enforcement of ordinances by fines and other punishments the section pertaining to penalties was valid In his minority opinion Judge Holcomb asserted that by a proper construction of the form as well as the substance of 603

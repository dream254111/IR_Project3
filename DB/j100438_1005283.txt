j100438,Transactions of the American Philosophical Society,1005283, A Memoir on the Extinct Dicotylin of America ,i241970,ARTICLE XXIII A Memoir on the extinct Dicolylinw of America By Joseph Leidy M D Read May 21 1852 The genus Dicotyles so far as our knowledge extends appears always to have replaced the genus Sus upon the American continent The two existing species of Dicotyles inhabit all the tropical partsof America and even extend into Texas The larger is the D labiatus the other the D torquatus I have not been able to find any authiority who gives the distinct osteological characters of the head of the two species except Dr Rengger in his Naturgeschichte der Siiugethiere von Paraguay p 329 De Blainville in his Osteogfraphie Article Sus has given three views in Plate V of the skull of D labiatus which he has named D torquatus although he has represented an undoubted entire skeleton of the latter in Plate III The differences observed between a specimen of the head of D labiatus and five speci mens of the head of D torquatus preserved in the collection of the Academy of Natulral Sciences are as follow The narrow portion of the cranium produced by the approach above of the temporal fosse is not only relatively but absolutely longer in D torquatus than in D labiatus The lower portion of the face is relatively broader in the latter produced by a promi nence commencing on the inner side of the infraorbitar foramen advancing and gra dually increasing to the canine alveolus The prominence slopes outwards from its upper part to its lower margin where it ceases abruptly and overhangs the anterior premolar alveoli and the edge of the hiatus in advance of the latter so as to conceal them in viewing the skull from above It encroaches on the transverse diameter of the infra orbitar foramen and thus gives it a semioval form It is hollow and accommodates a large portion of the inferior scroll of the turbinated bone In D torquatus the promi nence does not exist and its position is occupied by a concavity proceeding from the in fraorbitar foramen which in this species is oval Moreover the latter foramen in D tor quatus is above the third premolar while in the other species it is above the first true molar324 A MEMOIR ON THE EXTINCT The upper part of the face is broad and relatively inoderately convex in D labiatus but narrow and strongly arched in D torquatus In the direction of the length of the ossa nasi in the latter it is slightly convex but in the former in the same direction slightly concave The anterior free extremity of the nasal bones in D labiatus is relatively long and sub acute short and convex in D torquatus The external face of the malar bone below the orbit in the latter species is more de pressed than in the other and its inferoexternal margin forms an acute ridge continuous upon the superior maxillary bone shelving outwards from above advancing obliquely over the infraorbitar foramen and disappearing in a slight prominence in a position corre sponding to the bottom of the canine alveolus The face below this ridge to the alveolar margin is concave In D labiatus the ridge of the maxillary bone corresponding to the inferior margin of the malar bone curves much more upwards than in D torquatus and ceases a very considerable distance posterior to its termination in the latter species Be neath and within this ridge the face is more deeply and vertically depressed than in D torquatus The face just in advance of the orbits is less nearly vertical in the latter than in D la biatus In the lower jaw the most striking difference between the two species is the strong bend inwards of the angle in D torquatus and its nearly vertical condition in D labiatus Remains of extinct species of Dicotylina are frequent upon the American continent Lund first announced the existence of such remains in the Danske videnskab Selskabs naturvid Afhandl volumes 8 and 9 for 18412 He observes they are often found in numerous caves of Brazil and in the tables accompanying his memoirs enumerates five extinct species of Dicotyles but does not describe the specimens upon which they are established In Bronns Index PalaBontologicus part first p 422 is given the name Dicotyles major Lund as described by Clausen in the Neues Jahrbuch fur Mineralogie etc 1843 but to this work I have not had access In the American Journal of Science for 1848 Dr J L Le Conte published an account of a collection of mammalian remains found in the lead region of Illinois Most of the remains are referrible to Dycotylinae of which the author proposed three new species and genera Platygonus compressus Hyops depressifrons and Protochcerus prismaticus The former of these Dr Le Conte afterwards described in detail in the Memoirs of the Ame rican Academy of Science and Arts for 1848t Subsequently in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences for 1852t the fragments upon which was proposed Hyops depressifrons were referred to the genus Di cotyles and a few additional remarks given upon Protocheerus prismaticus  New series vol v p 102 Notice of five new species of Fossil Mammalia from Illinois t New series vol iii p 257 On Platygonus compressus a new fossil Pachyderm I Vol vi p 3 Ibid p 5DICOTYLINE OF AMERICA 325 In the same work Dr Le Conte notices a fossil Dicotyles from Benton county Mis souri found in association with bones of the Mastodon for which the name Dicotyles cos tatus is proposed My friend Le Conte with his usual liberality has presented to the Academy of Natural Sciences the specimens upon which the species and genera just mentioned have been founded Of these I propose to examine in the succeeding pages only the more characteristic not only for the purpose of determiniing as far as possible the distinct species and genera they indicate which alone is a subject of greater importance to Palaeontology than the unrid ding to which animal every fragment belongs but more particularly for the sake of conm parison with an almost perfect head of an extinct animal found in a saltpetre cave in Ken tucky belonging to the American Philosophical Society and deposited by this body in its desire to advance the interests of Science in the Cabinet of the Academy of Natural Sci ences The specimens of Dr Le Contes collection are very imperfect brittle and mutilated and their investigation has by no means proved an easy one nor have the results turned out so satisfactory as are desirable The most characteristic fossil for which the name Platygonus without doubt must be retained is the fragment of lower jaw presenting the peculiarity fromn which the animal derives its name The specimen consists of the hinder portion of the right half of the lower jaw of a mid dleaged adult It is mluch broken and contains the two posterior molars also broken and fragments of the two in advance P1 38 Fig 3 Accompanying the specimen and apparently belonging to the same individual are the crowns of the posterior two true mo lars and premolars of the left side and the last true molar and the inner lobes of the second and the three prenmolars of the right side of the upper jaw The fragment of lower jaw P1 38 Fig 3 is relatively deeper than in Dicotyles and the angle is not only directed mnore downwards but it curves very much outwards P1 37 Fig 9 The condyle broken at its inner side has its articular surface a little more convex than in Dicotyles and externally is not so prominent and exhibits a small depres sion for the attachment of the external lateral ligament The coronoid process is broken away The fossa posterior to the latter process has the same form as in Dicotyles buit is relatively deeper The two teeth preserved in the specimen P1 37 fig 10 are considerably worn the dentine being exposed in lobate patches upon all the dental lobes except the posterior and the internal of the middle pair of the last molar These teeth are intermediate in size to those of the two existing species of Dicotyles and are constructed on the same type but their triturating surfaces have none of the wrinkled appearance existing in Di cotyles and reaching its excess in Sus and the principal lobes are more prominently de veloped and relatively much longer and the lesser or accessory lobes of Dicotyles disap pear or exist only as continuous portions of the principal lobes From trituration the principal lobes of the teeth in the fossil have become combined into transverse pyramidal  Vol vi P 5326 A MEMOIR ON THE EXTINCT ridges separated by deep angular transverse valleys causing the teeth to assume a re inarkably taperoid appearance and indicating a movement in the lower jaw of Platygonus less rotary and more simply ginglymoid than exists in Dicotyles for at the same stage of trituration of the teeth in the latter the principal lobes would be worn down to a level with the bottom of the interlobular fissures approaching more in this respect the Hog than the Tapir In the last molar the fifth or posterior lobe broken in the specimen is simple and demiconoidal or flattened before and convex behind Between it and the internal of the second pair of lobes is a slight tubercle a constituent portion of the basal ridge In neither teeth of the specimen do constituent portions of the basal ridge exist inter nally between the lobes but externally portions unite the bases of the latter The upper true molars PI 37 fig 13 present the same striking peculiarities which distinguish thenm from Dicotyles as the lower ones that is to say the principal lobes are very robust and prominent the accessory lobes have disappeared and the former and the basal ridge are unwrinkled These teeth are quadrate constricted at the middle laterally have convex sides and are surrounded by a basal ridge open at the bases internally of the inner lobes The latter are trilobate as in Hippopotamus or expand before and behind where they come in contact with the outer lobes which are simply conoidal In the specimens the expan sions just mentioned are worn away leaving the transverse pairs of principal lobes associ ated as prominent pyramidal ridges separated by deep and wide transverse valleys as in the case of the corresponding teeth of the lower jaw The basal ridge is best developed anteriorly and posteriorly and though worn smooth to some degree yet appears never to have been so wrinkled or tuberculated and foveated as in the Peccary In the last molar posteriorly it is prominently convex and at the niddle rises in a simple short accessory tubercle associated with the posterointernal lobe The second and third premolars PI 37 fig 12 are like one half of the true molars They are quadrate with rounded sides and angles and narrowest and most convex inter nally and have a single transverse pair of lobes like those of the true molars surrounded by a cingulum open for a short space internally and externally at the bases of the cor responding lobes The cingulum or basal ridge is nearly twice as thick posteriorly as anteriorly The crown of the first premolar P1 37 fig 12 is trilateral with rounded angles and the apex forwards and consists of a single conical lobe surrounded at its inner fourfifths by a strong basal ridge best developed posteriorly Found in the same crevice with the specimens just described was a fragment of the face of a young animal containing upon the left side the three permnanent premolars which hiad not yet protruded the fangs of the canines and a single lateral incisor P1 38 fig 2 This specimen Dr Le Conte referred to Platygonus compressus in his memoir on the latter but subsequently from comparison with the cave head alluded to was led to suspect it belonged to Dicotyles depressifrons From more prolonged compa  Pr Acad Nat Sci vi 57DICOTYLINY OF AMERICA 327 rison hlowever I am inclined to believe Dr Le Conte was riglht in reftrring it to Platy gonus compressus for thie form of the fragment of face is very different from tlhe corre sponding portion of that specimen upon which Dicotyles depressifrons was characterized And fuirther the premolars contained in the fragment P1 37 fig II have the same form and size as those just described P1 37 fig 12 which with very little doubt be longed to the same individual as the fragment of lower jaw characteristic of Platygonus In both the first premolar possesses but a single conical lobe which is a very different condition of the tooth as it exists in Dicotyles or the cave head hereafter to be described The fragment of a face under consideration which most probably belongs to Platygonus compressus is constituted by portions of the superior maxillary bones the right inter maxillary bone and a portion of the right nasal bone It appears narrower or more com pressed laterally than in Dicotyles torquatus arising principally from the absence of the r idge so conspicuous in the latter proceeding fromi the inferior margin of the malar bone The nasal bone is a little less convex transversely than in Dicotyles torquatus but is about as much so longitudinally The crescentic ridge of the canine alveolus rises higher relatively than in Dicotyles and in its course forwards runs into the margin of the nares rThe intermaxillary bone appears to be unusually long its upper end being over three inches posterior to the sum mit of the canine alveolar ridge Its lateral surface at the upper extremity presents di rectly outwards but at the lower half inclines at an angle of abotut 50 The upper part of the superior maxillary bone about three inches posterior to tlle canine alveolar ridge is protuberant but presents no indication of possessing the acute ridge proceeding from the malar bone and characteristic of Dicotyles The permanent premolars P1 37 fig 11 preserved in the specimen from being unworn exhibit better their characters in detail than those described As before mentioned they have the same size and form of those just alluded to Their basal ridge is tuberculate and foveate The principal lobes in the hinder two premolars are confluent at the middle of their basal twothirds The hiatus between the first premolar and the canines is about one and three quarter inches The canines have about the same degree of divergence from each other as in Dicotyles but they appear to project a little tnore forward A detached upper canine tooth P1 37 fig 16 undoubtedly belonging to the same species and having the crown perfect and but little worn exhibits the same form and about the same degree of lateral compression as in Dicotyles torquatus The hiatus between the anterior margin of the canine and the lateral incisor is about ten lines The latter tooth in the specimen is one of the permanent incisors and it had not yet entirely protruded Its crown is but little more than half the size of that of D torquatus and its form is more simple being short and slightly compressed inammillary with the apex imipressed by an 0 shaped disk with a slightly prominent tubercle in its centre It is convex both anteriorly and posteriorly in the latter position being concave in Dicotyles VOL X59328 A MEMOIR ON THE EXTINCT In Dr Le Contes collection there is a second premolar Pl 37 fig 14 and the first and second true molars fig 15 of the superior left side which have been referred to Di cotyles depressifrons but which correspond so closely in size and formn with the teethi described of Platygonus that I think they belonged to another and younger individual only of the latter ADMEASUREMENTS OF PLATYGONUS Fragment of Lower Jaw

Fragment of an os calcis The most important specimen upon which the genus Hyops was proposed consists of the uipper portion of a cranium and face much fractured P1 3S Fig 1 The size of the fragment is such as to indicate the existence of an animal a little larger than the Dicotyles labiatus but possessing relatively a little shorter and broader forehead and a longer and broader but shallower face The lateral mnargins of the forehead and the upper part of the inion are broken away but it appears as if the length of the former had a little exceeded its breadth The forehead is also a little more depressed on eacl side The face slopes from the position of the orbitofrontal foramina more abruptly down wards and forwards than in Dicotyles and after two inches of its course rather abruptly ceases to incline so much downwards That portion of the ossa nasi posteriorly and outside of the groove leading from the orbitofrontal foramina is prominently convex and on a level with their median line The frontonasal suture formls the outlinie of a de pressed cone with rounded apex two and a half inches wide at base and thirteen lines in depth Anteriorly the ossa nasi are about as convex transversely as in D labiatus The orbitofrontal foramina are thirteen lines apart The upper extremity of the ossa intermaxillaria alone preserved in the specimen inclines at an angle only of about 350 and the distance of its point from the suture connecting the nasal process of the superior miaxillary bone with the os frontis is two inches one and a half lines The nasal process of the superior maxillary bone slopes from the ossa nasi laterally at an angle of about 350 A prominent acute ridge appears to have existed at the side of the superior maxillary bones proceeding forwards from the inferior margin of the malar bone in the existing species of Dicotyles and more especially like that in D labiatus but the specimen is too much mutilated to determine its exact extent and character The anterior extremity of the malar bone is broad not more depressed than in D labi atus and inclines at about the same angle as the contiguous portion of the superior mnaxil lary bone The fractured condition of the specimen permits the extensive sinuses to be seen which every where occupy a position between the tables of the cranial bones and communicate freely with the ethmnoidal and nasal sinuses From what has been stated in regard to this fragment it will have been perceived not to possess a single character which would separate the animal fromn the genus Dicotyles to which Dr Le Conte considered it belonging subsequently to its being first ascribed to IIyops  Pr A N S vi 3330 A MEMOIR ON TIHE EXTINCT Sdmeasurements of the Fragment of Cranium of Dicotyles depressifrons Length

Dicotyles depressifrons there also was found a fragment of the left side of the lower jaw contain ing a portion of the corresponding canine tooth and the distal extremity of a left canine possibly belonging to the same individual as the former The specimens indicate a larger species than those recent and both belonged to an old individual The fragment of jaw along the course of the canine alveolus externally is very convex and just posterior to the symphysis is ten lines thick and from the base to the edge of the hiatus a little posterior to the position of the mental foramen measures fifteen and a half lines The portion of the fang of the canine remaining in the alveolus at its broken extremity has the dental cavity nearly obliterated In transverse section the fang of the tooth is quadrilateral with its longest diameter anteroposterior anteriorly it is narrow est and convex externally it presents a projecting longitudinal ridge posteriorly a longi tudinal groove and internally is convex posteriorly but longitudinally depressed ante riorly The distal fragment of tooth presents the same relative proportions and form as the fragment of fang retained in the alveolus It of course becomes in section trilateral as in existing species of Dicotyles The end only of the specimen which in curve is two ani three quarter inches long has enamel upon it internally for about one inch externallv for ten lines and the body of the tooth with the exception of a remaining portion of tlhe pulp cavity about onetlhird of a line in diameter is a solid rod of dentine The greatest anteroposterior measurement of the fang is eight lines and that transverse six lines Other fragments probably belonging to Dicotyles depressifrons Some other specimens presented by Dr Le Conte to the Academy which may be coi sidered as belonging to Dicotyles depressifrons are as follow 1 Distal extremity of both ossa humeri slightly more robust than in Platygonus 2 Left os femoris like that of Dicotyles torquatus but larger its length being seven inches and its circumference at the middle of the shaft two inches and a quarter Besides these there are fragments of the second right metacarpal left os innominatum and left tibia also a scaphoid and cuboid and two first phalanges and one second phalanx The specimens upon which Dr Le Conte proposed the Protochberus prisinaticust consist of an inferior canine and a first true and a portion of a last molar of the right side most M lem Am Acad Arts and Sciences vol 3 pl iv fig 25 26 t Am JouLrn Sci 2d series vol V p 105 Proc Acad Nat Sci vol VI p 5DICOTYLINA OF AMERICA 33i probably of that above They were found under circumstances simnilar to those already described but in another locality fifteen miles distant The three teeth probably belonged to the same individual which had passed the middle of adult life as the specimen of the first true molar which is about the size of that of the collared Peccary has its characteristic triturating surface nearly obliterated The most characteristic specimen is the fragment of the last molar P1 37 fig 18 which in outline resembles more the lower than the corresponding upper tooth of the Peccary but its proper position has been rather determined by comparison with the teeth in the cave head In the robustness of its lobes it approaches more that of Platygonus than tthat of the Peccary and from their prominent prisiimoid character the specific name which has been applied to the animal is quite appropriate Its admeasurements are as follow Estimated anteroposterior diameter      10 lines Breadth at middle        6  The first true molar measures six lines anteroposteriorly and four and tlhree quarter lines in breadth The inferior canine was rather smaller than that of the cave head and it evidently be longed to an old individual as the enamelled portion of the crown is worn away to a lengtl of about sixteen lines while the remaining portion of the fang about ten lines long is somewhat gibbous and is solid except a pulp canal in the centre about half a line in dia meter In section the fang is oval but impressed posteriorly The external and inter nal faces of the crown are smooth and convex It is not possible at present to determine whether the teeth ascribed to ProtochoeruLs do not belong to the same animal characterized fromn a crainial fragment under the name of Dicotyles depressifrons If they should be proved hereafter to do so then both thle teeth and cranial fragment must fall back into the genuts Hyops previously proposed to Protochcorus for the posterior molar tooth described of the latter evidently is generically distinct from that of the recent Dicotyles Dicotyles costatus was established by Dr Le Conte from a fragment of the symplysis of the lower jaw in connexion with the right inferior canine tooth The specimen was found in Benton county Missouri in association with bones of the Mastodon The toothl is larger than that of Dicotyles labiatus and the anterior margin of the crown is more acute than in any of the specimens of recent Dicotyles which have come under my notice Its inner side is smooth and convex and its outer side presents a prominent longitudinal ridge from which the species is named but which is sometimes even better developed in the Dicotyles torquatus The specimen probably indicates a species larger than either of those existing ddmeasurements Greatest breadth at the base of the enamelled crown of the inferior canine 5 lines Anteroposterior diameter   7 66 On the occasion of the removal of the collection of Mammalian Remains deposited by the American Plhilosophical Society in the cabiniet of the Academy of Natural Sciences332 A MEMOIR ON THE EXTINCT I observed an apparently recent skull labelled Peccary presented by Dr Samuel Brown December 1805 It struck me as being unusually large which led me to compare it with the heads of the Dicotyles torquatus and D labiatus when it proved without doubt to be very distinct from either But how the head of a third species of existing Peccary should be preserved in the cabinet of our Society for fortyseven years and the animal be entirely unknown puzzled me On examining the minutes of the society for 1805 to find out the locality from whence the specimen was obtained the mystery was solved At a meeting of the Philosophical Society December 20th 1805 The bones of the head of a new animal found in a saltpetre cave and a specimen of pure native saltpetre were presented by Dr Brown of Kentucky In the course of the same meeting the head was referred to DrWistar for examination who at the meeting of January 7th 1806 reported that the head of what was supposed to be a new animal presented by Dr Brown proved to belong to the Peccary of South Arnerica as described by Daubenton in Buffons work Dr Harlan refers to this skull in a foot note to page 222 of his Fauna Americana and observes it certainly belonged to the recent Peccari The remarkable condition in which the specimen has been preserved no doubt favoured the impression of those who examined it that it belonged to the recent Peccary The texture remains entirely unchanged and it looks as fresh as if prepared but a few years ago and had become ochreous yellow from being kept out of the influence of light With in the open fangs of several of the molars I noticed a few snmall pieces of adhering adipo cire Its state of preservation however is not so remarkable as in the case of thie bones of the Megalonyx laquieatus Harlan contained in the Cabinet of the Academy of Natural Sciences and fouind under sirnilar circumnstances namely in a cave in Tennessee These bones not only retain their original texture but also have attached shreds of fibrous tissue portions of articular cartilage and upon one os unguis nearly the entire nail With the exception of the greater portion of the ossa nasi one upper canine and all the incisors but one inferior lateral the cave head uinder consideration is almost perfect P1 35 36 The animal to which it belonged had not yet reached adult age altlhough many of th sutures of the skull are nearly obliterated The suimmits only of the anterior lobes of the last molars of both jaws have just protruded and the deciduous molars had not been shed The latter are preserved on the left side of the upper jaw but all those of the lower jaw and of the right side above except one are lost The general form of the cave head is most like that of the recent Peccary but differs strikingly in the great relative breadth of the forehead and the more abrupt narrowing andl greater degree of prolongation of the face The upper part of the occiput in the fossil is relatively broader and shorter tlhan in tlle Peccary and the lateral margins instead of being nearly parallel as in the latter fornm with the summit a semicircle The inferolateral portions of the occiput on the same plane with the mastoid portions of the ossa tempora present nmore outwardly or are more bent forwards The occipital foramen has the same form as in the Peccary but the superior marain projects more posteriorly The condyles have the same relation to the foramen anll thle paramastoid pilocesses thle samel formn and directionDICOTYLINY OF AMERICA 333 The top of the cranium or forehead considered as extending from the inion to the root of the nose is broader at the postorbitar processes than it is long but in the Peccary the length greatly exceeds the breadth It is also more convex anteroposteriorly but mnuclh less so transversely being nearly flat The orbitofrontal foramina and the vasculoneural grooves leading fromn them to the side of the face hold the same position as in the Peccary From the depression of the forehead the orbit appears more elevated than in the latter the lachrymal tubercle being only eight lines below the level of the forehead in the fossil while it is one inch below it in D torquiatus The temporal fossa has the same form as in the latter but its surface extends more outwardly in the direction of the postorbitar processes Its length is absolutely not greater than in D torquatus buit it gains in depth and extent by the increased depth of the zygomatic process The malar bone is of extraordinary depth relatively very much miore than in the Pec cary Its outer side is not depressed as in the latter but is anteroposteriorly convex and the inferior mnargin rises much more upwardly The masseteric surface of origin instead of being directed downwards as in the Peccary presents more outwards as in the Hippopotamus and the acute margin bounding it externally ceases at the maxillary suture while in the Peccary it is continuouis with a highly characteristic promninent acute ridge of the maxillary bone advancing anterior to the position of the infraorbitar forainen rThe maxillary bone in the fossil immnediately in advance of its conjunction with the ma lar bone is elevated into a protuberance upon the same level as the outer surface of the malar bone The latter rises mnuch higher upon the face than in the Peccary reducing the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone into a relatively narrow strip and aiding in the elevation of the orbit anteriorly The transverse diameter of the orbit is greater than the vertical and its direction obliquely upwards and forwards but in the Peccary the former is the shorter diameter and its direction downward and forward The face anterior to the temporal fossa is relatively very long compared to that of the Peccary It is also relatively narrower principally fromn the absence of the ridge of the maxillary bone continuous with the mialar bone in the latter which also renders it nearly vertical from the edges of the ossa nasi at its anterior twothirds The central part of the sides of the face over the position of the infraorbitar foramen is concave and is most deeply so just anterior to the latter foramen which is oval in its form and situated above the interval of the third and fourth miolars The alveoli have a more advanced position in the face than in the Peccary in which the last molar is on a line with the antorbital margin but in the fossil is placed an inch anterior to it The upper part of the face as constituted by the ossa nasi is for the most part broken away in the fossil Its posterior part is broad and only a little convex transversely while its anterior threefourths judging from a small remaining fragment appears to have been as convex as in D torquatus The anterior extremity of the face is more pointed than in the Peccary from the ad334 A MEMOIR ON THE EXTINCT vancement of the intermaxillaries several lines beyond the alveoli of the central incisors indicating probably a more prolonged upper lip thaan in the animal just mentioned The basilar process instead of being nearly horizontal and plane as in the Peccary ascends obliquely is carinated inferiorly and terminates on each side anteriorly in a rela tively very large prominent tuberosity serving as an abutment fo the post sphenoidal body Just in advance of the condyles it is depressed on each side into a deep pit for muscular insertion The ossa tympanica have the same form and construction as in the Peccary The guttural region exhibits some of the most remarkable features of the cave head The postsphenoidal body in the Peccary ascends at a very obtuse angle from the basi lar process but in the fossil ascends vertically from the line of the palate and curves for ward continuous in the latter direction with the antsphenoidal body The surface of the postsphenoidal body presents directly forward and is concave on each side and that of the antsphenoidal body is directed downwards and is deeply concave upon each side of the azygous process Compared to the Peccary a relatively very deep and capacious fossa with concave sides exists in the fossil between the posterior nares and the post sphenoidal body It is divided anteroposteriorly by the middle prominence of the latter and the azygous process of the antsphenoidal body Its sides are constituted by thle anterior portion of the roots of the external pterygoid processes dilated or bulging out wardly in conjunction with a lateral expansion of the antsphenoidal body where it de scends to form the internal pterygoid process The comnmunication below is trilobate the corresponding position in the Peccary being cordiformii The ossa palati early unite with the superior maxillary bones as in the Peccary so that the transverse palate suture is no more visible In the Peccary the palate bones where they unite rise posteriorly in the form of a deep angular groove to the inferior edge of the nares but in the fossil their palate plates are transversely concave and form between the extremities of the internal pterygoid processes a sharp crescentic edge between which and the inferior margin of the nares is a remarkable ctuldesac divided into two unequal portions by a vertical partition on the left side of the median line The space in which this culdesac is situated is eleven lines high from the palatal to the naral margin and the bottom of the sac extends about onefourth of an inch anterior to the palatal margin An enormous cellular dilatation of an oval form apparently protrudes from between the maxillary and palate bones and extends backwards to the anterior margin of the external pterygoid process Its interior communicates anteriorly with the cavity of the nose ex ternally it is convex and on its inner surface forming the lateral parietes of the posterior nares is concave It is about two inclhes long and at the middle about ahn inch deep and threefourths of an inch wide It appears to be formed by the palate bone but of this I am not sure as its sutural connexions are for the most part obliterated A simi lar but stnaller dilatation exists in Dicotyles labiatus but in the specimen I have under comparisoni its sutural connexions are also entirely obliterated One of thie most remarkable characters of the cave head is the excessive cellular dilata tion of the bones about the middle of the face In addition to the larger dilatations justDICOTYLINA OF AMERICA 335 described between the posterior nares and temiiporomaxillary fossa the mialar bones are very much dilated and cellular the cells cormimunicating with the interior of the maxillary bones The latter also are not only very much dilated in advance of the malar bones but between these and the palate bones above the alveoli they extend backward in a cellular cavity closed behind by the os unguis at least an inch from the last molar tooth The foramina at the base of the cranium have the same arrangement and relations as in the Peccary The glenoid cavity is a little more anteroposterior in its long diameter than in the lat ter and instead of being upon a level at bottom with the os tympanica is removed from it obliquely downwards and forwards for nearly an inch by the unusual prolongation in this direction of the zygoma The meatus auditorius externus is placed in the same relative position as in the Peccary and is the extraordinary distance of two and a half inches from the glenoid articulation The hiatus anterior to the molars is relatively longer than in the Peccary Its mnargin is rounded and out of it rises a linear ridge proceeding to the back of the canine alveolus Above it the face exhibits an obtuse low ridge proceeding fromn just below the infraorbitar foramen forward and expanding the whole length of the crescentic ridge of the canine alveolus so conspicuous a character in the Peccary The latter ridge at its upper part turns inwards and forwards to the anterolateral edge of the nares as formed by the in termaxillaries and expands gradually downwards and vanishes uponi the incisive alveoli The notch included by the canine alveolar ridge for the receptioni of the crown of the lower canine when the jaws are closed is about one and a fourth inches high and as wide at bottom as the hiatus between the canine and lateral incisor The infraorbital canal commences immediately above the last molar alveolus The suprapalatine foramen as it should be called instead of sphenopalatine because the sphenoid bone does not always enter into its composition is placed above and to the inside of the former is bounded above by the large cellular dilatation of the poste rior nares and is continuous upwards and outwards with the fissure between the latter and the superior maxillary and lachrymnal bones The posterior palatine canal commences at the bottom of a vertical fissure passing from the last designated foramen downwards between the vertical plate of the palate bone and the tuberosity produced by tlle last molar alveolus Its exit upon the surface of the hard palate is near the middle of the hiatus an terior to the molars a couple of lines within its margin and is continuous with a groove advancing to the nasopalatine foramina as in the Peccary The relative position of the molars canines and incisors is the same as in the latter The true molars of the recent Peccary P 37 figs 14 appear to be constructed on the type of the Hog whereas in the cave head they partake more of the character of the lhippopotamus In the former the crowns present two pairs of principal short conoidal wrinkled tubercles with constituent portions of the basal ridge wrinkled and tuberculate The last lower molar as in all Pachyderms has its additional lobe In the latter the principal lobes are relatively very long prismoid not wrinkled but constricted at the sides and opposed to one another as in the Hippopotamus so that when the summits are worn off VOL X 6336 A MEMOIR ON THE EXTINCT they present a slight trefoil appearance The basal ridge where it exists is more foveate less wrinkled and more prominently tuberculate Indeed the true molars of the Peccary have the appearance as if they lhad been cast of some soft substance in the same mouild as those of the cave head and had become contracted in bulk and wrinkled in drying The three superior true molars P1 37 figs 5 6 of the cave head decrease in size from the last to the first the external lobes are smaller than the internal and a broad basal ridge surrounds them open only at the bases internally of the inner lobes and external part of the base of the anteroexternal lobe of the last tooth In the latter the posterior pair of lobes is shorter than the anterior and that posteroexternal is the shortest lobe of those of any of the teeth The external lobes are simply conoidal the inner ones are shaped like those of Hippo potamus or expand anteriorly and posteriorly where they come in contact with the for mer In the Peccary and Hog these expansions are more or less isolated appear ing as accessory wrinkled tubercles In the cave head the posterior expansion or fold of the anterointernal lobe comes in contact at its lower part with the anterior of the postero internal lobe and thus divides the transverse interlobular fissure The anterior fold of thle formner lobe and the posterior of the latter divide the basal ridge anteriorly and posteriorly and are confluent with it The basal ridge of the superior true molars anteriorly is thick delicately folded and finely denticulate at the free margin Posteriorly it has nearly the same appearance except in the last tooth where it is much thicker includes two small foveae with wrinkled sides and is divided by a fissure into two unequal tuberculoid portions Externally in the last tooth the ridge is continuous round the base of the posteroexternal lobe to the pos terior part of the lobe anterior is thick folded and crenulate at margin and between the lobes includes a fovea containing several minute tubercles On the other two molars externally the basal ridge is thinnest and between the lobes includes a fovea with wrinkled sides Internally in all the upper true molars constituent folded portions of the basal ridge connect the bases of the inner lobes and enclose foveae with wrinkled sides The inferior true molars P1 37 figs 7 8 have a greater anteroposterior diameter than those corresponding above but are narrower and their lobes also in pairs are mnore nearly equal and longer Constituent portions of the basal ridge exist anteriorly posteriorly and between the bases of the lobes externally and internally where it is how ever relatively feebly developed compared with its condition in the upper molars The teeth also decrease in size from the last to the first The lobes are elongated conoidal those internal sending a fold backward where they come in contact with the external lobes and the latter sending a like fold forwards The anterior fold of the posteroexternal lobe joins the posterior of the anterointernal lobe The posterior fold of the posterointernal lobe is relatively very slight to the others The basal ridge posteriorly rises into a prominent pyramidal tubercle most so in the last where it constitutes the fifth lobe and least in the first true molar Between this tubercle and the posterior pair of principal lobes in the last molar a second and smaller compressed tubercle exists Anteriorly the basal ridge is nearly horizontal and denticuDICOTYLINiE OF AMERICA 337 late Between the lobes externally it forms a small simple tubercle Internally in the same position it is hardly developed except in the last molar where it is also a simple tubercle In the latter tooth posteriorly on each side of the fifth lobe it is constituted by a simple tubercle The superior deciduous molars preserved in the cave head P1 37 fig 17 regularly decrease in size from the permanent true molars to the first of the former The third and second superior deciduous molars closely resemble the permanent teeth behind except that the anterior part of the crown of the second is narrower The first deciduous molar pos sesses but a single transverse pair of tubercles and its crown is trilateral From the trituration to which the deciduous teeth have been subjected trefoillike tracts of dentine are exposed upon the inner lobes atid simple transverse oval ones upon the summits of the outer lobes Judging from thie wearing of these teeth the relative length of the lobes of the permanent molars and the depth of their intervening valleys the movements of the lower jaw in the animal to which the cave head belonged were rather more restricted ginglymoid in their character than in Dicotyles but perhaps in a less de gree than in Platygonus In the Peccary the superior premolars P1 37 figs 1 2 still present the sanme general construction as the true molars The posterior two present very distinctly the four cha racteristic wrinkled conoidal lobes but the posterointernal is reduced in size in the third prernolar and is very feebly developed in the second The crown of the first is trilateral and still presents four distinct tubercles but only one is strikingly prominent In the cave head the three superior permanent premolars Pl 37 figs 5 6 present each a transverse pair of permanent lobes like those of the true molars surrounded by a basal ridge The latter anteriorly and posteriorly is very thick and denticulate at the margin In the posterior two premolars the hinder portion encloses four small irregular foveae with wrinkled sides the anterior portion two similar btut larger foveae In the first premolar the basal ridge forms a cup with wrinkled sides from the bottom of which project the two characteristic lobes The inferior premolars Pl 37 figs 7 8 of the cave head resemble those of the D torqua tus P1 37 figs 34 with the principal lobes much exaggerated They decrease successively anteriorly and are much more nearly equilaterally quadrate than in thle Peccary The pos terior two premolars of the fossil are more like the second than the third of the Peccary but are relatively broader Each has a transverse pair of principal lobes very long and shaped like those of the true molars and bounded behind by a very thick basal ridge rising in an aniteroposterior prominence at the middle and enclosing on each side of the latter a large fovea with wrinkled sides Anteriorly also the basal ridge exists but is feeble whether contrasted with the posterior portion or that corresponding to it in the D tor quatus The first premolar is square or relatively very broad contrasted with that of the Peccary and the basal ridge forms a cup with wrinkled sides out of the bottom of which rises a transverse pair of short conoidal lobes In Dicotyles the exserted portion of the upper unworn canine is enveloped in enamel ceasing by a sinuous margin at its base and deeply notched anteriorly Trhe inferior338 A MEMOIR ON TIlE EXTINCT canines also when unworn are enveloped in enamel even deeply into the alveoli except on the posterior concave surface where a long angular notch extends upwards into the enamel covering As the animal advances in life a little after adult age the enamel is completely worn off from the posterior face of the latter tooth and at a later period the enamelled portion of the tooth becomes completely exserted from the alveolus the per inanently growing dentinal portion alone occuipying the latter In the cave head we have been partictularly engaged in examining the canine teeth do not differ in construction fromn those of the existing Dicotyles and their form also is very nearly the same They are a very little larger thian those of D torquatus The superior canine is compressed to about the same degree as in the former but it is a little narrower more convex externally and to a trifling extent less so internally The lower canine is relatively more exserted than in either existing species of Dicotyles is convex and smooth internally and externally and exhibits only a slight disposition to the forma tion of a ridge at the lower part of the enamelled crown externally As before stated the incisors are not preserved in the cave head except one P1 37 fig 19 of those inferior and lateral This is smaller than in D torquatus is enclosed within the alveolus and appears as if it would have always remnained concealed Its crown is simply nmammillary very sliglhtly compressed anterointernally Having described this interesting specimen in comparison with the two existing species of Dicotyles we have next to ascertain whether it differs from any of those Dicotylinae whose former existence has been established by Dr Le Conte From the fragment of lower jaw of Platygonus compressus the corresponlding portion of the cave head differs in its being relatively less deep and in its angle not being produced so much downwards and instead of curving outwards as is so rermarkably the case in Platygonus it is nearly vertical The postcoronoid depression is also considerably less deep rThe posterior two molars are a little larger than those remaining in the specimen of Platygonus and in the last molar a large accessory lobe is introduced between tlle fiftl and middle pair of lobes no trace of which exists in the latter A good deal of similarity exists between the fragment of the face of Platygonus and the corresponding portion of the cave head In both they present about the same degree of lateral compression the acute ridge of the superior nmaxillary bone proceeding from the inalar bone as in Dicotyles is absent the crescentic ridge of the canine alveolus has about the same extent and course and in the same relative position in advance of the malar bone superiorly the upper maxillary bone is protuberant But in the cave head the face is relatively longer while its intermaxillaries are broader and very much slhorter being 21 inches in length from the lateral notch of the nares while in Platygonuis they are one inch longer The posterior two premolars have nearly the same form but the basal ridge is less strong in Platygonus and is not so deeply foveated The first premolar in tthe cave head is quadrate and hias two prominent principal lobes like the two posterior lpremolars and possesses a strong basal cingulum open for a short space only internally in Plat gonusDICOTYLINXA OF AMERICA 339 the first premolar is trilateral with one principal lobe and has its basal ridge open ex ternally The last superior true molar of the cave head is trilateral with its rounded apex posterior while in Platygonus it is broader quadrate has its constituent portions of the basal ridge laterally less developed and has its posteroexternal lobe better developed Ilaving said enough to prove the cave head is not only specifically but generically dis tinct from Platygonus compressus we have next to compare it with the specimens referred to Dicotyles depressifrons With this purpose in view the first thing which strikes us in examining the fragment of skull of the latter is the evident existence of the acute ridge on the side of the superior maxillary bone proceeding from the inferior margin of the malar bone as in recent species of Dicotyles but which loes not exist in the cave head In the fragment of the skull of Dicotyles depressifrons as before stated the forehead appears to have been longer than broad as in recent species of the genus but in the cave head the breadthl greatly exceeds the length The face is very much broader in Dicotyles depressifrons than in the latter and has probably been slhorter for in the fragment the distance from the upper end of the inter maxillaries to the sututre of the nasal process of the superior maxillary bones witlh the frontal is a little over two inches while in the cave head from the same points the distance is one and a quarter inches greater In Dicotyles depressifrons the nasal process of the upper maxillary bone is broader and more rapidly divergent anteriorly than in the cave head The upper extremity of the intermaxillaries initthe former incline 350 while in the latter it is nearly vertical and the face behind these bones still sloping in the Dicotyles depressifrons to the margin of the maxillomalar ridge is veitical in the cave head until it begins to dilate posteriorly Other but more trifling differences exist but it is evident from the comparison which has been made that the cave head without doubt distinct from Dicotyles also evidently could not have belonged to the same animal characterized by the cranial fragment as Dicotyles depressifrons The only specimen among those referred to Protochcerus prismaticus sufficiently cha racteristic for comparison with the cave head is the fragmient of a last upper molar The first upper true molar of the cave head has about the same size and if worn down to the samne extent would probably have the same appearance as that ascribed to Protochoerus which however would also be the case witlh the mnuch worn tooth of Dicotyles The lower canine also of the cave head if much worn down would present about the same size and proportions as that of Protochoerus and this also would be the case with thlat of the collared Peccary under the same circumstances The last upper molar of the cave head is in a trifling degree broader than that of Pro tochcerus and the posteroexternal lobe is relatively to the others less developel The basal ridge in the former posteriorly forms three short tubercles enclosing as many fovem but in the fragment of tooth in the same position forms a prominent lobe larger than the fifth lobe of the last lower molar of the cave head and to the anteroexternal side of this forms another and smaller tubercle the two enclosingf a single fovea Tese characters of comparison which have been presented between the corresponding340 A MEMOIR ON THE EXTINCT last molar tooth of Protochoerus and the cave head nmay be variable in the same species but of this we must renmain in doubt until further discovery of more miaterial and until further evidence can be brougicht to prove the cave head belonged to Protochoerus it will be at least of advantage in the way of reference to consider the former as distinct and I therefore propose for the animal to which it belonged the name of Euchaerus macrops In conclusion in answer to what may be urged by some naturalists that the characters given of Platygonus Protochoerus and Euchoerus are not sufficient to rank then as dis tinct genera from Dicotyles I must add that it will be admitted that the recognised species of the latter present characters in common not possessed by any of the preceding genera and therefore these should be distinct and among these new genera differences exist quite as important as those separating them from Dicotyles Those who acknowledge the distinc tion between Machairodus and Felis Ovibos and Bos Acerotherium and Rhinoceros etc will readily admit this reasonirng and with such naturalists who are so precise as to con sider Bison Bubalus Bibos etc distinct from Bos or Alces Tarandus Cariacus Mega aceros and Strongyloceros etc from Cervus the matter is beyond dispute Comnparative ldmeaeuremente of the head of

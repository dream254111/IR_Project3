J100438,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY,1005283, A MEMOIR ON THE EXTINCT DICOTYLIN OF AMERICA ,I241970,ARTICLE XXIII A MEMOIR ON THE EXTINCT DICOLYLINW OF AMERICA BY JOSEPH LEIDY M D READ MAY 21 1852 THE GENUS DICOTYLES SO FAR AS OUR KNOWLEDGE EXTENDS APPEARS ALWAYS TO HAVE REPLACED THE GENUS SUS UPON THE AMERICAN CONTINENT THE TWO EXISTING SPECIES OF DICOTYLES INHABIT ALL THE TROPICAL PARTSOF AMERICA AND EVEN EXTEND INTO TEXAS THE LARGER IS THE D LABIATUS THE OTHER THE D TORQUATUS I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY AUTHIORITY WHO GIVES THE DISTINCT OSTEOLOGICAL CHARACTERS OF THE HEAD OF THE TWO SPECIES EXCEPT DR RENGGER IN HIS NATURGESCHICHTE DER SIIUGETHIERE VON PARAGUAY P 329 DE BLAINVILLE IN HIS OSTEOGFRAPHIE ARTICLE SUS HAS GIVEN THREE VIEWS IN PLATE V OF THE SKULL OF D LABIATUS WHICH HE HAS NAMED D TORQUATUS ALTHOUGH HE HAS REPRESENTED AN UNDOUBTED ENTIRE SKELETON OF THE LATTER IN PLATE III THE DIFFERENCES OBSERVED BETWEEN A SPECIMEN OF THE HEAD OF D LABIATUS AND FIVE SPECI MENS OF THE HEAD OF D TORQUATUS PRESERVED IN THE COLLECTION OF THE ACADEMY OF NATULRAL SCIENCES ARE AS FOLLOW THE NARROW PORTION OF THE CRANIUM PRODUCED BY THE APPROACH ABOVE OF THE TEMPORAL FOSSE IS NOT ONLY RELATIVELY BUT ABSOLUTELY LONGER IN D TORQUATUS THAN IN D LABIATUS THE LOWER PORTION OF THE FACE IS RELATIVELY BROADER IN THE LATTER PRODUCED BY A PROMI NENCE COMMENCING ON THE INNER SIDE OF THE INFRAORBITAR FORAMEN ADVANCING AND GRA DUALLY INCREASING TO THE CANINE ALVEOLUS THE PROMINENCE SLOPES OUTWARDS FROM ITS UPPER PART TO ITS LOWER MARGIN WHERE IT CEASES ABRUPTLY AND OVERHANGS THE ANTERIOR PREMOLAR ALVEOLI AND THE EDGE OF THE HIATUS IN ADVANCE OF THE LATTER SO AS TO CONCEAL THEM IN VIEWING THE SKULL FROM ABOVE IT ENCROACHES ON THE TRANSVERSE DIAMETER OF THE INFRA ORBITAR FORAMEN AND THUS GIVES IT A SEMIOVAL FORM IT IS HOLLOW AND ACCOMMODATES A LARGE PORTION OF THE INFERIOR SCROLL OF THE TURBINATED BONE IN D TORQUATUS THE PROMI NENCE DOES NOT EXIST AND ITS POSITION IS OCCUPIED BY A CONCAVITY PROCEEDING FROM THE IN FRAORBITAR FORAMEN WHICH IN THIS SPECIES IS OVAL MOREOVER THE LATTER FORAMEN IN D TOR QUATUS IS ABOVE THE THIRD PREMOLAR WHILE IN THE OTHER SPECIES IT IS ABOVE THE FIRST TRUE MOLAR324 A MEMOIR ON THE EXTINCT THE UPPER PART OF THE FACE IS BROAD AND RELATIVELY INODERATELY CONVEX IN D LABIATUS BUT NARROW AND STRONGLY ARCHED IN D TORQUATUS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE LENGTH OF THE OSSA NASI IN THE LATTER IT IS SLIGHTLY CONVEX BUT IN THE FORMER IN THE SAME DIRECTION SLIGHTLY CONCAVE THE ANTERIOR FREE EXTREMITY OF THE NASAL BONES IN D LABIATUS IS RELATIVELY LONG AND SUB ACUTE SHORT AND CONVEX IN D TORQUATUS THE EXTERNAL FACE OF THE MALAR BONE BELOW THE ORBIT IN THE LATTER SPECIES IS MORE DE PRESSED THAN IN THE OTHER AND ITS INFEROEXTERNAL MARGIN FORMS AN ACUTE RIDGE CONTINUOUS UPON THE SUPERIOR MAXILLARY BONE SHELVING OUTWARDS FROM ABOVE ADVANCING OBLIQUELY OVER THE INFRAORBITAR FORAMEN AND DISAPPEARING IN A SLIGHT PROMINENCE IN A POSITION CORRE SPONDING TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CANINE ALVEOLUS THE FACE BELOW THIS RIDGE TO THE ALVEOLAR MARGIN IS CONCAVE IN D LABIATUS THE RIDGE OF THE MAXILLARY BONE CORRESPONDING TO THE INFERIOR MARGIN OF THE MALAR BONE CURVES MUCH MORE UPWARDS THAN IN D TORQUATUS AND CEASES A VERY CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE POSTERIOR TO ITS TERMINATION IN THE LATTER SPECIES BE NEATH AND WITHIN THIS RIDGE THE FACE IS MORE DEEPLY AND VERTICALLY DEPRESSED THAN IN D TORQUATUS THE FACE JUST IN ADVANCE OF THE ORBITS IS LESS NEARLY VERTICAL IN THE LATTER THAN IN D LA BIATUS IN THE LOWER JAW THE MOST STRIKING DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO SPECIES IS THE STRONG BEND INWARDS OF THE ANGLE IN D TORQUATUS AND ITS NEARLY VERTICAL CONDITION IN D LABIATUS REMAINS OF EXTINCT SPECIES OF DICOTYLINA ARE FREQUENT UPON THE AMERICAN CONTINENT LUND FIRST ANNOUNCED THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH REMAINS IN THE DANSKE VIDENSKAB SELSKABS NATURVID AFHANDL VOLUMES 8 AND 9 FOR 18412 HE OBSERVES THEY ARE OFTEN FOUND IN NUMEROUS CAVES OF BRAZIL AND IN THE TABLES ACCOMPANYING HIS MEMOIRS ENUMERATES FIVE EXTINCT SPECIES OF DICOTYLES BUT DOES NOT DESCRIBE THE SPECIMENS UPON WHICH THEY ARE ESTABLISHED IN BRONNS INDEX PALABONTOLOGICUS PART FIRST P 422 IS GIVEN THE NAME DICOTYLES MAJOR LUND AS DESCRIBED BY CLAUSEN IN THE NEUES JAHRBUCH FUR MINERALOGIE ETC 1843 BUT TO THIS WORK I HAVE NOT HAD ACCESS IN THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE FOR 1848 DR J L LE CONTE PUBLISHED AN ACCOUNT OF A COLLECTION OF MAMMALIAN REMAINS FOUND IN THE LEAD REGION OF ILLINOIS MOST OF THE REMAINS ARE REFERRIBLE TO DYCOTYLINAE OF WHICH THE AUTHOR PROPOSED THREE NEW SPECIES AND GENERA PLATYGONUS COMPRESSUS HYOPS DEPRESSIFRONS AND PROTOCHCERUS PRISMATICUS THE FORMER OF THESE DR LE CONTE AFTERWARDS DESCRIBED IN DETAIL IN THE MEMOIRS OF THE AME RICAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCE AND ARTS FOR 1848T SUBSEQUENTLY IN THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF NATURAL SCIENCES FOR 1852T THE FRAGMENTS UPON WHICH WAS PROPOSED HYOPS DEPRESSIFRONS WERE REFERRED TO THE GENUS DI COTYLES AND A FEW ADDITIONAL REMARKS GIVEN UPON PROTOCHEERUS PRISMATICUS  NEW SERIES VOL V P 102 NOTICE OF FIVE NEW SPECIES OF FOSSIL MAMMALIA FROM ILLINOIS T NEW SERIES VOL III P 257

WITH BONES OF THE MASTODON FOR WHICH THE NAME DICOTYLES COS TATUS IS PROPOSED MY FRIEND LE CONTE WITH HIS USUAL LIBERALITY HAS PRESENTED TO THE ACADEMY OF NATURAL SCIENCES THE SPECIMENS UPON WHICH THE SPECIES AND GENERA JUST MENTIONED HAVE BEEN FOUNDED OF THESE I PROPOSE TO EXAMINE IN THE SUCCEEDING PAGES ONLY THE MORE CHARACTERISTIC NOT ONLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINIING AS FAR AS POSSIBLE THE DISTINCT SPECIES AND GENERA THEY INDICATE WHICH ALONE IS A SUBJECT OF GREATER IMPORTANCE TO PALAEONTOLOGY THAN THE UNRID DING TO WHICH ANIMAL EVERY FRAGMENT BELONGS BUT MORE PARTICULARLY FOR THE SAKE OF CONM PARISON WITH AN ALMOST PERFECT HEAD OF AN EXTINCT ANIMAL FOUND IN A SALTPETRE CAVE IN KEN TUCKY BELONGING TO THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY AND DEPOSITED BY THIS BODY IN ITS DESIRE TO ADVANCE THE INTERESTS OF SCIENCE IN THE CABINET OF THE ACADEMY OF NATURAL SCI ENCES THE SPECIMENS OF DR LE CONTES COLLECTION ARE VERY IMPERFECT BRITTLE AND MUTILATED AND THEIR INVESTIGATION HAS BY NO MEANS PROVED AN EASY ONE NOR HAVE THE RESULTS TURNED OUT SO SATISFACTORY AS ARE DESIRABLE THE MOST CHARACTERISTIC FOSSIL FOR WHICH THE NAME PLATYGONUS WITHOUT DOUBT MUST BE RETAINED IS THE FRAGMENT OF LOWER JAW PRESENTING THE PECULIARITY FROMN WHICH THE ANIMAL DERIVES ITS NAME THE SPECIMEN CONSISTS OF THE HINDER PORTION OF THE RIGHT HALF OF THE LOWER JAW OF A MID DLEAGED ADULT IT IS MLUCH BROKEN AND CONTAINS THE TWO POSTERIOR MOLARS ALSO BROKEN AND FRAGMENTS OF THE TWO IN ADVANCE P1 38 FIG 3 ACCOMPANYING THE SPECIMEN AND APPARENTLY BELONGING TO THE SAME INDIVIDUAL ARE THE CROWNS OF THE POSTERIOR TWO TRUE MO LARS AND PREMOLARS OF THE LEFT SIDE AND THE LAST TRUE MOLAR AND THE INNER LOBES OF THE SECOND AND THE THREE PRENMOLARS OF THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE UPPER JAW THE FRAGMENT OF LOWER JAW P1 38 FIG 3 IS RELATIVELY DEEPER THAN IN DICOTYLES AND THE ANGLE IS NOT ONLY DIRECTED MNORE DOWNWARDS BUT IT CURVES VERY MUCH OUTWARDS P1 37 FIG 9 THE CONDYLE BROKEN AT ITS INNER SIDE HAS ITS ARTICULAR SURFACE A LITTLE MORE CONVEX THAN IN DICOTYLES AND EXTERNALLY IS NOT SO PROMINENT AND EXHIBITS A SMALL DEPRES SION FOR THE ATTACHMENT OF THE EXTERNAL LATERAL LIGAMENT THE CORONOID PROCESS IS BROKEN AWAY THE FOSSA POSTERIOR TO THE LATTER PROCESS HAS THE SAME FORM AS IN DICOTYLES BUIT IS RELATIVELY DEEPER THE TWO TEETH PRESERVED IN THE SPECIMEN P1 37 FIG 10 ARE CONSIDERABLY WORN THE DENTINE BEING EXPOSED IN LOBATE PATCHES UPON ALL THE DENTAL LOBES EXCEPT THE POSTERIOR AND THE INTERNAL OF THE MIDDLE PAIR OF THE LAST MOLAR THESE TEETH ARE INTERMEDIATE IN SIZE TO THOSE OF THE TWO EXISTING SPECIES OF DICOTYLES AND ARE CONSTRUCTED ON THE SAME TYPE BUT THEIR TRITURATING SURFACES HAVE NONE OF THE WRINKLED APPEARANCE EXISTING IN DI COTYLES AND REACHING ITS EXCESS IN SUS AND THE PRINCIPAL LOBES ARE MORE PROMINENTLY DE VELOPED AND RELATIVELY MUCH LONGER AND THE LESSER OR ACCESSORY LOBES OF DICOTYLES DISAP PEAR OR EXIST ONLY AS CONTINUOUS PORTIONS OF THE PRINCIPAL LOBES FROM TRITURATION THE PRINCIPAL LOBES OF THE TEETH IN THE FOSSIL HAVE BECOME COMBINED INTO TRANSVERSE PYRAMIDAL  VOL VI P 5326 A MEMOIR ON THE EXTINCT RIDGES SEPARATED BY DEEP ANGULAR TRANSVERSE VALLEYS CAUSING THE TEETH TO ASSUME A RE INARKABLY TAPEROID APPEARANCE AND INDICATING A MOVEMENT IN THE LOWER JAW OF PLATYGONUS LESS ROTARY AND MORE SIMPLY GINGLYMOID THAN EXISTS IN DICOTYLES FOR AT THE SAME STAGE OF TRITURATION OF THE TEETH IN THE LATTER THE PRINCIPAL LOBES WOULD BE WORN DOWN TO A LEVEL WITH THE BOTTOM OF THE INTERLOBULAR FISSURES APPROACHING MORE IN THIS RESPECT THE HOG THAN THE TAPIR IN THE LAST MOLAR THE FIFTH OR POSTERIOR LOBE BROKEN IN THE SPECIMEN IS SIMPLE AND DEMICONOIDAL OR FLATTENED BEFORE AND CONVEX BEHIND BETWEEN IT AND THE INTERNAL OF THE SECOND PAIR OF LOBES IS A SLIGHT TUBERCLE A CONSTITUENT PORTION OF THE BASAL RIDGE IN NEITHER TEETH OF THE SPECIMEN DO CONSTITUENT PORTIONS OF THE BASAL RIDGE EXIST INTER NALLY BETWEEN THE LOBES BUT EXTERNALLY PORTIONS UNITE THE BASES OF THE LATTER THE UPPER TRUE MOLARS PI 37 FIG 13 PRESENT THE SAME STRIKING PECULIARITIES WHICH DISTINGUISH THENM FROM DICOTYLES AS THE LOWER ONES THAT IS TO SAY THE PRINCIPAL LOBES ARE VERY ROBUST AND PROMINENT THE ACCESSORY LOBES HAVE DISAPPEARED AND THE FORMER AND THE BASAL RIDGE ARE UNWRINKLED THESE TEETH ARE QUADRATE CONSTRICTED AT THE MIDDLE LATERALLY HAVE CONVEX SIDES AND ARE SURROUNDED BY A BASAL RIDGE OPEN AT THE BASES INTERNALLY OF THE INNER LOBES THE LATTER ARE TRILOBATE AS IN HIPPOPOTAMUS OR EXPAND BEFORE AND BEHIND WHERE THEY COME IN CONTACT WITH THE OUTER LOBES WHICH ARE SIMPLY CONOIDAL IN THE SPECIMENS THE EXPAN SIONS JUST MENTIONED ARE WORN AWAY LEAVING THE TRANSVERSE PAIRS OF PRINCIPAL LOBES ASSOCI ATED AS PROMINENT PYRAMIDAL RIDGES SEPARATED BY DEEP AND WIDE TRANSVERSE VALLEYS AS IN THE CASE OF THE CORRESPONDING TEETH OF THE LOWER JAW THE BASAL RIDGE IS BEST DEVELOPED ANTERIORLY AND POSTERIORLY AND THOUGH WORN SMOOTH TO SOME DEGREE YET APPEARS NEVER TO HAVE BEEN SO WRINKLED OR TUBERCULATED AND FOVEATED AS IN THE PECCARY IN THE LAST MOLAR POSTERIORLY IT IS PROMINENTLY CONVEX AND AT THE NIDDLE RISES IN A SIMPLE SHORT ACCESSORY TUBERCLE ASSOCIATED WITH THE POSTEROINTERNAL LOBE THE SECOND AND THIRD PREMOLARS PI 37 FIG 12 ARE LIKE ONE HALF OF THE TRUE MOLARS THEY ARE QUADRATE WITH ROUNDED SIDES AND ANGLES AND NARROWEST AND MOST CONVEX INTER NALLY AND HAVE A SINGLE TRANSVERSE PAIR OF LOBES LIKE THOSE OF THE TRUE MOLARS SURROUNDED BY A CINGULUM OPEN FOR A SHORT SPACE INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY AT THE BASES OF THE COR RESPONDING LOBES THE CINGULUM OR BASAL RIDGE IS NEARLY TWICE AS THICK POSTERIORLY AS ANTERIORLY THE CROWN OF THE FIRST PREMOLAR P1 37 FIG 12 IS TRILATERAL WITH ROUNDED ANGLES AND THE APEX FORWARDS AND CONSISTS OF A SINGLE CONICAL LOBE SURROUNDED AT ITS INNER FOURFIFTHS BY A STRONG BASAL RIDGE BEST DEVELOPED POSTERIORLY FOUND IN THE SAME CREVICE WITH THE SPECIMENS JUST DESCRIBED WAS A FRAGMENT OF THE FACE OF A YOUNG ANIMAL CONTAINING UPON THE LEFT SIDE THE THREE PERMNANENT PREMOLARS WHICH HIAD NOT YET PROTRUDED THE FANGS OF THE CANINES AND A SINGLE LATERAL INCISOR P1 38 FIG 2 THIS SPECIMEN DR LE CONTE REFERRED TO PLATYGONUS COMPRESSUS IN HIS MEMOIR ON THE LATTER BUT SUBSEQUENTLY FROM COMPARISON WITH THE CAVE HEAD ALLUDED TO WAS LED TO SUSPECT IT BELONGED TO DICOTYLES DEPRESSIFRONS FROM MORE PROLONGED COMPA  PR ACAD NAT SCI VI 57DICOTYLINY OF AMERICA 327 RISON HLOWEVER I AM INCLINED TO BELIEVE DR LE CONTE WAS RIGLHT IN REFTRRING IT TO PLATY GONUS COMPRESSUS FOR THIE FORM OF THE FRAGMENT OF FACE IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM TLHE CORRE SPONDING PORTION OF THAT SPECIMEN UPON WHICH DICOTYLES DEPRESSIFRONS WAS CHARACTERIZED AND FUIRTHER THE PREMOLARS CONTAINED IN THE FRAGMENT P1 37 FIG II HAVE THE SAME FORM AND SIZE AS THOSE JUST DESCRIBED P1 37 FIG 12 WHICH WITH VERY LITTLE DOUBT BE LONGED TO THE SAME INDIVIDUAL AS THE FRAGMENT OF LOWER JAW CHARACTERISTIC OF PLATYGONUS IN BOTH THE FIRST PREMOLAR POSSESSES BUT A SINGLE CONICAL LOBE WHICH IS A VERY DIFFERENT CONDITION OF THE TOOTH AS IT EXISTS IN DICOTYLES OR THE CAVE HEAD HEREAFTER TO BE DESCRIBED THE FRAGMENT OF A FACE UNDER CONSIDERATION WHICH MOST PROBABLY BELONGS TO PLATYGONUS COMPRESSUS IS CONSTITUTED BY PORTIONS OF THE SUPERIOR MAXILLARY BONES THE RIGHT INTER MAXILLARY BONE AND A PORTION OF THE RIGHT NASAL BONE IT APPEARS NARROWER OR MORE COM PRESSED LATERALLY THAN IN DICOTYLES TORQUATUS ARISING PRINCIPALLY FROM THE ABSENCE OF THE R IDGE SO CONSPICUOUS IN THE LATTER PROCEEDING FROMI THE INFERIOR MARGIN OF THE MALAR BONE THE NASAL BONE IS A LITTLE LESS CONVEX TRANSVERSELY THAN IN DICOTYLES TORQUATUS BUT IS ABOUT AS MUCH SO LONGITUDINALLY THE CRESCENTIC RIDGE OF THE CANINE ALVEOLUS RISES HIGHER RELATIVELY THAN IN DICOTYLES AND IN ITS COURSE FORWARDS RUNS INTO THE MARGIN OF THE NARES RTHE INTERMAXILLARY BONE APPEARS TO BE UNUSUALLY LONG ITS UPPER END BEING OVER THREE INCHES POSTERIOR TO THE SUM MIT OF THE CANINE ALVEOLAR RIDGE ITS LATERAL SURFACE AT THE UPPER EXTREMITY PRESENTS DI RECTLY OUTWARDS BUT AT THE LOWER HALF INCLINES AT AN ANGLE OF ABOTUT 50 THE UPPER PART OF THE SUPERIOR MAXILLARY BONE ABOUT THREE INCHES POSTERIOR TO TLLE CANINE ALVEOLAR RIDGE IS PROTUBERANT BUT PRESENTS NO INDICATION OF POSSESSING THE ACUTE RIDGE PROCEEDING FROM THE MALAR BONE AND CHARACTERISTIC OF DICOTYLES THE PERMANENT PREMOLARS P1 37 FIG 11 PRESERVED IN THE SPECIMEN FROM BEING UNWORN EXHIBIT BETTER THEIR CHARACTERS IN DETAIL THAN THOSE DESCRIBED AS BEFORE MENTIONED THEY HAVE THE SAME SIZE AND FORM OF THOSE JUST ALLUDED TO THEIR BASAL RIDGE IS TUBERCULATE AND FOVEATE THE PRINCIPAL LOBES IN THE HINDER TWO PREMOLARS ARE CONFLUENT AT THE MIDDLE OF THEIR BASAL TWOTHIRDS THE HIATUS BETWEEN THE FIRST PREMOLAR AND THE CANINES IS ABOUT ONE AND THREE QUARTER INCHES THE CANINES HAVE ABOUT THE SAME DEGREE OF DIVERGENCE FROM EACH OTHER AS IN DICOTYLES BUT THEY APPEAR TO PROJECT A LITTLE TNORE FORWARD A DETACHED UPPER CANINE TOOTH P1 37 FIG 16 UNDOUBTEDLY BELONGING TO THE SAME SPECIES AND HAVING THE CROWN PERFECT AND BUT LITTLE WORN EXHIBITS THE SAME FORM AND ABOUT THE SAME DEGREE OF LATERAL COMPRESSION AS IN DICOTYLES TORQUATUS THE HIATUS BETWEEN THE ANTERIOR MARGIN OF THE CANINE AND THE LATERAL INCISOR IS ABOUT TEN LINES THE LATTER TOOTH IN THE SPECIMEN IS ONE OF THE PERMANENT INCISORS AND IT HAD NOT YET ENTIRELY PROTRUDED ITS CROWN IS BUT LITTLE MORE THAN HALF THE SIZE OF THAT OF D TORQUATUS AND ITS FORM IS MORE SIMPLE BEING SHORT AND SLIGHTLY COMPRESSED INAMMILLARY WITH THE APEX IMIPRESSED BY AN 0 SHAPED

DISTANCE OF ITS POINT FROM THE SUTURE CONNECTING THE NASAL PROCESS OF THE SUPERIOR MIAXILLARY BONE WITH THE OS FRONTIS IS TWO INCHES ONE AND A HALF LINES THE NASAL PROCESS OF THE SUPERIOR MAXILLARY BONE SLOPES FROM THE OSSA NASI LATERALLY AT AN ANGLE OF ABOUT 350 A PROMINENT ACUTE RIDGE APPEARS TO HAVE EXISTED AT THE SIDE OF THE SUPERIOR MAXILLARY BONES PROCEEDING FORWARDS FROM THE INFERIOR MARGIN OF THE MALAR BONE IN THE EXISTING SPECIES OF DICOTYLES AND MORE ESPECIALLY LIKE THAT IN D LABIATUS BUT THE SPECIMEN IS TOO MUCH MUTILATED TO DETERMINE ITS EXACT EXTENT AND CHARACTER THE ANTERIOR EXTREMITY OF THE MALAR BONE IS BROAD NOT MORE DEPRESSED THAN IN D LABI ATUS AND INCLINES AT ABOUT THE SAME ANGLE AS THE CONTIGUOUS PORTION OF THE SUPERIOR MNAXIL LARY BONE THE FRACTURED

LABELLED PECCARY PRESENTED BY DR SAMUEL BROWN DECEMBER 1805 IT STRUCK ME AS BEING UNUSUALLY LARGE WHICH LED ME TO COMPARE IT WITH THE HEADS OF THE DICOTYLES TORQUATUS AND D LABIATUS WHEN IT PROVED WITHOUT DOUBT TO BE VERY DISTINCT FROM EITHER BUT HOW THE HEAD OF A THIRD SPECIES OF EXISTING PECCARY SHOULD BE PRESERVED IN THE CABINET OF OUR SOCIETY FOR FORTYSEVEN YEARS AND THE ANIMAL BE ENTIRELY UNKNOWN PUZZLED ME ON EXAMINING THE MINUTES OF THE SOCIETY FOR 1805 TO FIND OUT THE LOCALITY FROM WHENCE THE SPECIMEN WAS OBTAINED THE MYSTERY WAS SOLVED AT A MEETING OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY DECEMBER 20TH 1805 THE BONES OF THE HEAD OF A NEW ANIMAL FOUND IN A SALTPETRE CAVE AND A SPECIMEN OF PURE NATIVE SALTPETRE WERE PRESENTED BY DR BROWN OF KENTUCKY IN THE COURSE OF THE SAME MEETING THE HEAD WAS REFERRED TO DRWISTAR FOR EXAMINATION WHO AT THE MEETING OF JANUARY 7TH 1806 REPORTED THAT THE HEAD OF WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A NEW ANIMAL PRESENTED BY DR BROWN PROVED TO BELONG TO THE PECCARY OF SOUTH ARNERICA AS DESCRIBED BY DAUBENTON IN BUFFONS WORK DR HARLAN REFERS TO THIS SKULL IN A FOOT NOTE TO PAGE 222 OF HIS FAUNA AMERICANA AND OBSERVES IT CERTAINLY BELONGED TO THE RECENT PECCARI THE REMARKABLE CONDITION IN WHICH THE SPECIMEN HAS BEEN PRESERVED NO DOUBT FAVOURED THE IMPRESSION OF THOSE WHO EXAMINED IT THAT IT BELONGED TO THE RECENT PECCARY THE TEXTURE REMAINS ENTIRELY UNCHANGED AND IT LOOKS AS FRESH AS IF PREPARED BUT A FEW YEARS AGO AND HAD BECOME OCHREOUS YELLOW FROM BEING KEPT OUT OF THE INFLUENCE OF LIGHT WITH IN THE OPEN FANGS OF SEVERAL OF THE MOLARS I NOTICED A FEW SNMALL PIECES OF ADHERING ADIPO CIRE ITS STATE OF PRESERVATION HOWEVER IS NOT SO REMARKABLE AS IN THE CASE OF THIE BONES OF THE MEGALONYX LAQUIEATUS HARLAN CONTAINED IN THE CABINET OF

DEVELOPED AND HAS ITS POSTEROEXTERNAL LOBE BETTER DEVELOPED ILAVING SAID ENOUGH TO PROVE THE CAVE HEAD IS NOT ONLY SPECIFICALLY BUT GENERICALLY DIS TINCT FROM PLATYGONUS COMPRESSUS WE HAVE NEXT TO COMPARE IT WITH THE SPECIMENS REFERRED TO DICOTYLES DEPRESSIFRONS WITH THIS PURPOSE IN VIEW THE FIRST THING WHICH STRIKES US IN EXAMINING THE FRAGMENT OF SKULL OF THE LATTER IS THE EVIDENT EXISTENCE OF THE ACUTE RIDGE ON THE SIDE OF THE SUPERIOR MAXILLARY BONE PROCEEDING FROM THE INFERIOR MARGIN OF THE MALAR BONE AS IN RECENT SPECIES OF DICOTYLES BUT WHICH LOES NOT EXIST IN THE CAVE HEAD IN THE FRAGMENT OF THE SKULL OF DICOTYLES DEPRESSIFRONS AS BEFORE STATED THE FOREHEAD APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN LONGER THAN BROAD AS IN RECENT SPECIES OF THE GENUS BUT IN THE CAVE HEAD THE BREADTHL GREATLY

QUARTER INCHES GREATER IN DICOTYLES DEPRESSIFRONS THE NASAL PROCESS OF THE UPPER MAXILLARY BONE IS BROADER AND MORE RAPIDLY DIVERGENT ANTERIORLY THAN IN THE CAVE HEAD THE UPPER EXTREMITY OF THE INTERMAXILLARIES INITTHE FORMER INCLINE 350 WHILE IN THE LATTER IT IS NEARLY VERTICAL AND THE FACE BEHIND THESE BONES STILL SLOPING IN THE DICOTYLES DEPRESSIFRONS TO THE MARGIN OF THE MAXILLOMALAR RIDGE IS VEITICAL IN THE CAVE HEAD UNTIL IT BEGINS TO DILATE POSTERIORLY OTHER BUT MORE TRIFLING DIFFERENCES EXIST BUT IT IS EVIDENT FROM THE COMPARISON WHICH HAS BEEN MADE THAT THE CAVE HEAD WITHOUT DOUBT DISTINCT FROM DICOTYLES ALSO EVIDENTLY COULD NOT HAVE BELONGED TO THE SAME ANIMAL CHARACTERIZED BY THE CRANIAL FRAGMENT AS DICOTYLES DEPRESSIFRONS THE ONLY SPECIMEN AMONG THOSE REFERRED TO PROTOCHCERUS PRISMATICUS SUFFICIENTLY CHA RACTERISTIC FOR COMPARISON WITH THE CAVE HEAD IS THE FRAGMIENT OF A LAST UPPER MOLAR THE FIRST UPPER TRUE MOLAR OF THE CAVE HEAD HAS ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AND IF WORN DOWN TO THE SAMNE EXTENT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE THE SAME APPEARANCE AS THAT ASCRIBED TO PROTOCHOERUS WHICH HOWEVER WOULD ALSO BE THE CASE WITLH THE MNUCH WORN TOOTH OF DICOTYLES THE LOWER CANINE ALSO OF THE CAVE HEAD IF MUCH WORN DOWN WOULD PRESENT ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AND PROPORTIONS AS THAT OF PROTOCHOERUS AND THIS ALSO WOULD BE THE CASE WITH THLAT OF THE COLLARED PECCARY UNDER THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES THE LAST UPPER MOLAR OF THE CAVE HEAD IS IN A TRIFLING DEGREE BROADER THAN THAT OF PRO TOCHCERUS AND THE POSTEROEXTERNAL LOBE IS RELATIVELY TO THE OTHERS LESS DEVELOPEL THE BASAL RIDGE IN THE FORMER POSTERIORLY FORMS THREE SHORT TUBERCLES ENCLOSING AS MANY FOVEM BUT IN THE FRAGMENT OF TOOTH IN THE SAME POSITION FORMS A PROMINENT LOBE LARGER THAN THE FIFTH LOBE OF THE LAST LOWER MOLAR OF THE CAVE HEAD AND TO THE ANTEROEXTERNAL SIDE OF THIS FORMS ANOTHER AND SMALLER TUBERCLE THE TWO ENCLOSINGF A SINGLE FOVEA TESE CHARACTERS OF COMPARISON WHICH HAVE BEEN PRESENTED BETWEEN THE CORRESPONDING340 A MEMOIR ON THE EXTINCT LAST MOLAR TOOTH OF PROTOCHOERUS AND THE CAVE HEAD NMAY BE VARIABLE IN THE SAME SPECIES BUT OF THIS WE MUST RENMAIN IN DOUBT UNTIL FURTHER DISCOVERY OF MORE MIATERIAL AND UNTIL FURTHER EVIDENCE CAN BE BROUGICHT TO PROVE THE CAVE HEAD BELONGED TO PROTOCHOERUS IT WILL BE AT LEAST OF ADVANTAGE IN THE WAY OF REFERENCE TO CONSIDER THE FORMER AS DISTINCT AND I THEREFORE PROPOSE FOR THE ANIMAL TO WHICH IT BELONGED THE NAME OF EUCHAERUS MACROPS IN CONCLUSION IN ANSWER TO WHAT MAY BE URGED BY SOME NATURALISTS THAT THE CHARACTERS GIVEN OF PLATYGONUS PROTOCHOERUS AND EUCHOERUS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO RANK THEN AS DIS TINCT GENERA FROM DICOTYLES I MUST ADD THAT IT WILL BE ADMITTED THAT THE RECOGNISED SPECIES OF THE LATTER PRESENT CHARACTERS IN COMMON NOT POSSESSED BY ANY OF THE PRECEDING GENERA AND THEREFORE THESE SHOULD BE DISTINCT AND AMONG THESE NEW GENERA DIFFERENCES EXIST QUITE AS IMPORTANT AS THOSE SEPARATING THEM FROM DICOTYLES THOSE WHO

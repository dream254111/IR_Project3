of Criminal Law and Criminology,i247505,THE MODERNIZATION OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE1 PRELIMINARY SUGGESTIONS FOR A REPORT OF COMMITTEE D OF THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CRIMINAL LAW AND CRIMINOLOGY BY ROBERT W MILLAR2 In view of the need for eventual formulation of a comprehensive set of procedural principles upon which the Institute can take its stand it will be proper at the outset to recall the recommendations made by predecessors in office of the present committee The draft report of the committee for 1910113 prepared by three of the six members of the committee dealt first with the mode of accusation and secondly with the elimination of unnecessary techni cality in relation to appeals On the first question it recommended that I It should be made permissible in all jurisdictions to prosecute any and every species of offender by information after examination and commitment by a magistrate permitting also prosecution by indict ment with or without such examination and commitment II Amendment of indictments and informations should be al lowed 1 as to all formal matters in any court at any time 2 in order to prevent variance by the trial court before or during trial upon such terms as will afford to the accused reasonable notice and opportunity to make his defense 3 after trial to conform to the proofs either in the trial court or in a court of review where the variance was not expressly brought to the attention of the trial court when the evidence was offered and the trial proceeded without claim by the accused that he was not properly notified of the case actually made against him III The office of an indictment or information should be 1 to give the accused notice of the crime with which he is charged and of the case on the facts which will be made against him 2 to set out the facts constituting the alleged offense with sufficient exactness to support a plea of former conviction or former acquittal as the case 1The body of this paper was read before the annual meeting of the Amer ican Institute of Criminal Law and Criminology at Indianapolis Sept 17 1920 2Professor of Law in Northwestern University SJournal of Criminal Law and Criminology Vol 1 p 584CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 345 may be The further office of providing a formal basis for the judg ment of conviction so that the indictment or information must set forth everything which is necessary to a complete case on paper no longer serves any useful end produces miscarriages of justice and should be done away with As to the second point its recommendations were I Rules of procedure intended solely to provide for the orderly dispatch of business saving of public time and maintenance of the dignity of tribunals should be distinguished carefully from rules in tended to secure to the accused a fair opportunity to meet the case against him and a full opportunity to present his own case rulings upon the former class should be reviewable only for abuse of discre tion and nothing should depend on or be obtainable through the latter class except the securing of such opportunity II No prosecution should be thrown out solely because brought in or taken to the wrong court or wrong venue but if there is one where it may be brought or prosecuted it should be transferred thereto and go on there all prior proceedings being saved III Questions of law conclusive of the controversy or of some part thereof should be reserved and a verdict should be taken subject thereto if the questions are at all doubtful with power in the court and in any other court to which the cause may be taken for review to enter judgment either upon the verdict or upon the point reserved as its judgment upon such point reserved may require IV Any court to which a cause is taken for review should have power to take additional evidence by affidavit deposition or reference as rule of court may prescribe for the purpose of sustaining a verdict wherever the error complained of is lack of proof of some matter capable of proof by record or other incontrovertible evidence defective certification or failure to lay the proper foundation for evidence which can in fact without involving some question for a jury be shown to have been competent V No conviction should be set aside or new trial granted for error as to any matter of procedure unless it shall appear to the review ing court that the error complained of has a resulted in a conviction not authorized by substantive law or b deprived the accused of some right given by adjective law to insure a fair opportunity to meet the case against him or a full opportunity to present his own The report of the committee for 1912134 was to the following effect Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology Vol 3 p 566 CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 345346 ROBERT W MILLAR I It concurred expressly in the first and substantially in the second recommendation of the previous committee It followed with the further recommendations II That such legislation be had as will give to the trial judge the right to charge juries orally and to limit exceptions to such charge to the specific objections made by counsel at the time of the charge in the presence of the jury and before it has retired from the bar the committee however recording its opinion that it would be unwise to give to the trial courts the right to comment to the jury favorably or unfavorably upon the weight of the evidence or the credibility of witnesses III That such legislation be enacted in the several states as shall limit the right of appeal to such defendants as shall secure from the trial judge a certificate reciting that the cause is one which contains some doubtful or uncertain question of law or fact or that for some other reason it is one which should be reviewed by the court of appeal Failing to secure such certificate such defendant could then apply to the court of review for the right to appeal and such court shall grant such appeal only when it shall be of the opinion that the case is one where an injustice has been done IV That not only should courts of criminal appeal have the power to reduce or increase penalties without reversing causes where in their judgment such a course is proper but likewise have the power to set aside the judgment and sentence of the court and pass such other sentence as is warranted by the evidence having due regard for the rights of all parties involved V That such legislation be enacted as will give to courts of review the power to examine the accused under oath and to hear the evidence of such other witnesses offered on behalf of appellant as the court may elect VI That such legislation be enacted as will give to both sides in a habeas corpus proceeding the right to apply to an appellate court for a review of the judgment either by appeal writ of error cer tiorari exceptions or by a certification of questions of law A minority report also appears expressing the dissent of one member from the second and fourth recommendations5 The report of the committee for 1914156 was of a different char acter consisting of a complete draft of an indictments act This draft proposed a system of criminal pleadingsubstantially like prevailing Journal of Law and Criminology Vol 3 p 577 Id Vol 5 p 827 346 ROBERT W MILLARCRIMINAL PROCEDURE 347 in Massachusetts since 1899the principle of which is thus summar ized in the introductory part of the report The first pleading on the part of the state be it an indictment niformation or some other formal pleading need only state the offense which is to be proved against the person accused If this be stated such pleading is sufficient to give the court jurisdiction and if the accused requests no further information it is sufficient to warrant and sustain a trial and judgment If however the defendant does request information as to the transaction to be proved e g if he wishes to know the name of his vicitim or description of property taken or in jured the first pleading may be supplemented by another or other pleadings known as bills of particulars The problems thus dealt with are of tremendous importance in the determination of an efficient system of criminal procedure But there are many imperfections of general prevalence which the preced ing recommendations have necessarily left untouched As a step there fore toward the declaration of principles ultimately desirable on the part of the Institute it is submitted that the deliberations of the exist ing committee extend at least to the ten questions hereafter appearing Some of these have been suggested by members of the committee for others the chairman accepts the present responsibility I Where the act or omission occasioning the criminal offense also gives rise to a cizil liability should not provision be made at the election of the person aggrieved for determining both the criminal and civil liability in a single proceeding This is a form of procedure which apart from the English statute later to be mentioned apparently does not exist in more than germ in any AngloAmerican jurisdiction Originating in France it has taken root in Belgium Italy Spain Holland Norway Hungary and elsewhere on the Continent and according to the chairmans informa tion is embodied in the draft code of criminal procedure of the Re public of China Of the institution in France which may be taken as typical Sir James Fitzjames Stephens says In every French crim inal proceeding from the most trifling to the most important any person injured by the offender may make himself partie civile In certain cases he may by doing so be made liable in damages to the accused A French criminal trial may thus be also a civil proceeding for damages by the party injured by the crime and at the same time an action by the accused for what we should call a malicious prosecu tion7 The Code dInstruction Criminelle provides that the civil 71 History of Criminal Law p 524 347 CRIMINAL PROCEDURE348 ROBERT W MILLAR action may be prosecuted at the same time and before the same judges as the public action but may be prosecuted independently in which case it is suspended until the termination of any criminal action begun prior to or during its prosecution8 It further requires a formal declaration of damage on the part of the injured person before he can be considered partie civile this may be interposed at any stage of the case down to the close of the trial arguments9 We found this institution in the Philippines and Porto Rico as a legacy of Spanish dominion and have wisely left it undisturbed In the case of the former it was preserved by the following provision of General Orders No 58 1900 of the Military Governor issued in modification of the former system of criminal procedure The privileges it was pro vided now secured by law to the person claiming to be injured by the commission of an offense to take part in the prosecution of the offense and to recover damages for the injury sustained by reason of the same shall not be held to be abridged by the provisions of this order but such person may appear and shall be heard either individually or by attorney at all stages of the case and the court upon conviction of the accused may enter judgment against him for the damages occa sioned by his wrongful act It shall however be the duty of the promotor fiscal to direct the prosecution subject to the right of the person injured to appeal from any decision of the court denying him a legal right0 The great argument in favor of such a plan is of course the economy of time and effort which it is calculated to effect Where a civil action follows upon the heels of a private prosecution we do in two actions what might easily have been done in one When the same act is both a crime and a tort it is from the mouths of the same witnesses that we must ascertain the facts in either kind of liability Why not therefore make one hearing of the witnesses suffice It may be urged that the presence of the counsel for the injured person as an active auxiliary of the public prosecutor would make the odds too heavy against the accusedthat the energy and skill of the private counsel which under existing conditions counts against the accused only in the civil action would materially aid in the convic tion But assistance of the prosecution by private counsel is no novelty in current practice And when a civil action is contemplated it is probably not unusual for the aggrieved persons counsel to cooperate with the public prosecutor in the preparation of the states case It is 8Art 5 9Arts 66 67 loPenal Code of the Philippine Islands 1911 Appendix p 307 348 ROBERT W MILLARCRIMINAL PROCEDURE 349 not likely that the innovation would cause any great difference from the present system in the matter of equality of legal representation Another objection might be placed on the ground that adoption of this procedure would make the effectuation of the civil right more or less dependent on the competence and activity of the public prose cutor But in any legislation on the subject the control of the prose cutor over the civil action could be reduced to a minimum and the complainant should be at liberty to introduce such relevant and com petent evidence as he chooses without hindrance from the prosecutor as well as to dismiss his action without prejudice down to the time of the jury leaving the bar Moreover it should always be optional with the complainant whether to join or not in the first place It has been suggested that the difference in the rules as to burden of proof obtaining in criminal and civil proceeding stands in the way Undoubtedly it presents a difficulty Under the established rule the act or omission looked at as a crime must be proved beyond a reason able doubt looked at as a tort it need not only be proved by a pre ponderance of the evidence It would unquestionably be too academic a practice to ask the jury to apply that double standard The simplest way therefore would be to require both issues to be established beyond a reasonable doubt That is to say the jury would be in structed as they are today that the evidence must satisfy them beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the act in question If there is any prospect that the responsibility of the de fendant cannot be so proved then the complainant under the optional character of the procedure may refrain from joining and have as now his action at law But as to any fact required to be proved on the civil and not the criminal issue such as the amount of damages suf fered it would be feasible to gauge proof of this by the ordinary civil standard The different standards being in this instance applied to different themes of proof an intelligent jury would be in no more danger of confusion than if it had heard a civil case immediately fol lowing a criminal one Nor can there be any objection on the ground that this institution tends to confuse the boundaries of civil and criminal justice The two actions remain distinct All that is done is to join them for procedural convenience For that matter the principle here involved is not alto gether a new one in our law When the criminal court in a case of theft makes an order for the restitution of the stolen property as has been competent for it since the 2nd Henry VIII c 1111 what else Bishop New Criminal Procedure 2nd ed Vol 3 sec 756 CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 349350 ROBERT W MILLAR is it doing but ascertaining and determining a civil liability collateral to the criminal liability which it has fixed by its sentence In England indeed there has been even a further approach to the Continental idea By the Forfeitures Act 1870 33 and 34 Vict c 23 it was provided that the criminal court if it shall think fit upon the application of any person aggrieved and immediately after the conviction of any person for felony to award any sum of money not exceeding one hundred pounds by way of satisfaction or compensation for any loss of property suffered by the applicant through or by means of the said felony and the amount awarded for such satisfaction or compensation shall be deemed a judgment debt etc No doubt the fact that a majority of offenders are persons of no financial responsibility has had much to do with our acceptance of the present condition But it is nevertheless true that there are many cases where the innovation suggested is urgently needed The case for instance of the motorist found guilty of assault or manslaughter occasioned by culpably negligent driving is one in point It would seem to be in accord with practical justice that the same jury which found him guilty of the criminal offense should assess the civil damages II Should not the defendant in all cases be required by way of plea or otherwise to give the prosecution notice of the natwre of his defense At common law every kind of defense was admissible under the plea of not guilty except former acquittal or conviction or pardon Many states have done away with these exceptions and leave the defendant free to show all defenses under not guilty On the other hand some jurisdictions have introduced the requirement that the pros ecution be given notice of an intended defense of insanity at the time of commission of the offense As appears from the report of Com mittee B of the Institute for 1911 this is true of New York Alabama Louisiana and Washington12 Why should not we go further and require reasonable notice to the state of the character of the defense in all cases A chief need in this regard concerns the defense of alibi That the manufactured alibi is one of the main avenues for escape of the guilty needs no demonstration Moreover the amount of perjury that is annually committed in this connection forms a most considerable item in the mass of unpunished crime This would be checked and the fabricated alibi rendered most difficult if the accused were to be required to give the prosecution such notice of the intended defense as would enable it to confirm or refute the accuseds assertion Such is 12Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology Vol 3 p 890 Vol 4 p 67 350 ROBERT W MILLARCRIMINAL PROCEDURE 351 the practice in Scotland where a defendant is not permitted to prove an alibi unless he pleads it as a special defense In so doing he must specify the place where he intends to show he was at the time in question3 In the Scottish criminal procedure special notice must be given also of the defenses of insanity at the time of the offense selfdefense that the defendant was asleep at such time or that the crime was com mitted by another person named1 If it is not desirable to require notice of the nature of the defense in all cases certainly it should be required in the cases of alibi self defense and insanity at the time of the act Moreover former acquittal or conviction should be the subject of such notice as at common law The statute of limitations also is a defense which should come in this class it being presupposed that the rules relating to the indictment or information relieve the prosecution from the duty now illogically imposed upon it of negativing such defense in advance So far as the defenses of former jeopardy and statute of limitations are con cerned it would be more in accord with sound principle to make these the subject of special pleas as were former acquittal and conviction under the common law practice Notice of the other defenses men tioned viz insanity selfdefense and alibi should more appropriately come by way of a written specification under the plea of not guilty as is now the rule in New York with reference to insanityl5 The method last indicated would be the one to follow however broad is made the requirement of notice If the defense is one by way of confession and avoidance a special plea would be proper if essen tially a denial then the vehicle of notice should be a written specifica tion under not guilty III Should it not be open to the prosecution to comment on the failure of the defendant to testify in his own behalf The right not to incriminate oneself is something that most of us would be unwilling to disturb although there are some like Mr Moor field Story who would do away with it altogether Still it is a fair question whether we have not gone too far in seeking to avoid the natural inferences arising from the defendants silence A common provision of constitution or statute is that the failure of the accused to testify shall create no presumption against him Washington and Nevada make it the duty of the court to instruct the jury that no such 3Wood and Renton Criminal Procedure pp 73 319 140p cit p 73 Millar Reform of Criminal Pleading in Illinois Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology Vol 8 p 336 CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 351352 ROBERT W MILLAR presumption arises In a large number of jurisdictions there is an express prohibition of comment to the jury on the failure Iowa has probably the most extreme provision in this regard It declares that the fact of failure to testify shall have no weight against the defendant nor shall the attorney or attorneys for the state during the trial refer to the fact that the defendant did not testify on his own behalf and should they do so such attorney or attorneys will be guilty of a mis demeanor and the defendlant shall for that cause alone be entitled to a new trial16 If the verdict of the jury were final there would be little to be said on the present subject For in spite of every interposition of the law the jury as has been frequently pointed out will assuredly draw the forbidden inferences It can hardly be otherwise than that as reason able men they should draw from the silence of accused what Mr Moorfield Story aptly describes as all the inferences which men inevitably draw from silence where one would naturally speak17 But when the case is appealed the situation assumes a different complexion If the prohibition against comment has been contravened the result even in the absence of an explicit provision like that of Iowa will often be a reversal For it will be said that a presumption of error arises from the comment and if there is nothing before the court to rebut this it is of no moment how guilty in point of fact the defendant actually is It is consequently a very pertinent question as to whether the real as distinguished from the technical benefit to the defendant proceeding from the prohibition is such as to compensate for the frequent mis carriages of justice which it effects One jurisdiction has answered this question in the negative The Constitution of Ohio adopted in 1914 after guaranteeing to the defend ant the privilege of not being compelled to testify against himiself provides that his failure to do so may be considered by the court and may be made the subject of comment by counsel8 It is clear that reversals because a prosecuting attorney has directed the attention of the jury to a circumstance which no intelligent person could help taking into consideration of his own accord should have no place in any well ordered system of criminal procedure It may be that to accomplish this a following of the Ohio example is necessary An alternative suggestion offered by one member of the committee would grant to the court alone the right to make such comment on the s6Compiled Code of Iowa 1919 sec 9464 17Some Practical Suggestions as to the Reform of Criminal Procedure Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology Vol 4 p 495 18Art 1 sec 10 352 ROBERT W MILLARCRIMINAL PROCEDURE 353 ground that comment by counsel would tend to be partisan and unfair But if it should be concluded that comment by counsel is advisable it would seem that abuse here could be checked and controlled by a com petent court quite as well as it could be in any other part of the argument IV So far as consistent with the preservation of the accuseds right of confrontation should not the rights of the prosecution and defense be on a parity with reference to the introduction of evidence taken on deposition of a witness who is dead sick insane or absent from the jurisdiction at the time of trial Independently of statute depositions taken on commission were unknown both in civil and criminal proceedings Where at the time of trial the witness himself was unavailable resort might be had at com mon law under some circumstances to his testimony given on a former trial involving the same issue or to his deposition before the committing magistrate in the same case provided that the accused had had the opportunity of crossexamining any adverse witness19 So far as the defendant is concerned statutes have nearly everywhere given him in criminal as in civil proceedings the right to resort to depositions taken on commission where the witness is dead or otherwise unavailable A few jurisdictions still withhold it Notable among these is Illinois when it was held in 1914 that inasmuch as the statutes had made no provision for depositions in criminal cases the court had no power to require the prosecution to consent to the introduction of a deposition on behalf of the defendant on pain of postponement of the trial20 With respect to the prosecution however the lawmakers of the several states have been much less generous Most of the jurisdictions which have conceded this right to the defendant make no grant of it in any form to the state It is not unusual however to find a provision to the effect that either side may introduce a deposition taken by the defendant A few states make the right of the state to take depositions contingent upon consent of the defendant One jurisdiction at least Oregon has a provision whereby as a condition precedent to obtain ing a continuance the defendant may be required to consent to the tak ing of a deposition on behalf of the state A provision occurring in Massachusetts and Michigan is to the effect that the prosecuting officer may join in a commission granted the defendant to take the testimony of material witnesses residing out of the jurisdiction and name any material witnesses to be examined on behalf of the state In New 9Bishop New Criminal Procedure 2nd ed Vol 2 secs 1194 et seq 20People v Turner 265 Ill 594 CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 353354 ROBERT W MILLAR York California Colorado Arizona Utah and perhaps elsewhere there may be a conditional examination on behalf of the state of a witness who is unable to find security for his appearance California limits this right to cases other than homicide but has a further pro vision enabling the state as well as the defendant to take the deposition of any material witness who is about to leave the state or is so sick or infirm as to afford reasonable ground for apprehension that he will be unable to attend the trial Both in this and the preceding case the deposition may be read at the trial upon a showing that the presence of the witness cannot be had21 The great obstacle of course to the allowance of depositions on behalf of the prosecution has been the necessity of observing the con stitutional guaranty that the defendant shall be confronted by the wit nesses against him This necessity may be met to a very large extent by providing opportunity for the defendant to be present and cross examine the witnesses in question California requires that examina tion of the witness unable to find security must be by question and answer in the presence of the defendant or after notice to him if on bail and conducted in the same manner as the examination before a committing magistrate is required by this code to be conducted22 Its provision in this regard as to the other kind of conditional examina tion is that the defendant has the right to be present in person and with counsel at such examination and if the defendant is in custody the officer in whose custody he is must be informed of the time and place of such examination and must take the defendant thereto and keep him in the presence and hearing of the witness during the examination28 Recent legislation on this subject in Ohio also deserves attention rhe Constitution of 191224 declares that provision may be nmade by law for the taking of the deposition by the accused or by the state to be used for or against the accused of any witness whose attendance cannot be had at the trial always securing to the accused means and the opportunity to be present in person and with counsel at the taking of such deposition and to examine the witness face to face as fully and in the same manner as if in court Accordingly in 1913 the existing law on the subject of depositions in criminal cases was amended so as to provide for the granting of a commission to the prosecuting attorney as well as the defendant to take the deposition of a witness who resides 2lDeerings Penal Code 1915 secs 1335 1336 1345 22Ibid sec 882 28Ibid sec 1340 24Art 1 sec 10 354 ROBERT W MILLARCRIMINAL PROCEDURE 355 out of the state is sick or infirm or is about to leave the state or is confined in prison Provision was made for confrontation substantially in the language of the constitution25 By a further amendnient adopted in 1917 there was imposed a very proper restriction dictated by the exigencies of confrontation namely that no such deposition was to be taken outside of the state if the defendant was in confinement26 If the extension of the use of depositions indicated in the question be deemed a proper measure of reform it could be effected by the general adoption of statutes based on the California and Ohio pro visions But in addition to the classes of witnesses enumerated in these enactments there would seem also to be need of provision for the conditional examination at the discretion of the prosecutor even of witnesses who are able to give security for their appearance The necessity for this if newspaper accounts be correct is well illustrated by the recent Enright murder case in Chicago where according to these accounts the trial of those charged as principals was rendered impossi ble by reason of the inability of the state to find its two main witnesses who had been released on bail If the depositions of these two wit nesses had been available this unfortunate result would have been averted No harm can possibly be done by the adoption of such a practice for if the witness presence can be had at the trial use of the deposition naturally would be prohibited V Should not less than a unanimous vote of the jury be suf ficient for conviction at least in other than capital cases The common law requirement of unanimity in the verdict is one which can probably be relaxed even in cases of felony without impair ing the protection of the accused As a result of the existing rule the presence of a single irrational biased or corrupt juror may cause a disagreement and tend to prevent ultimate conviction notwithstanding overwhelming evidence of guilt For the effect of a disagreement reaches beyond its purely legal incidence It is but a commonplace to say that it means scattering of the witnesses and general discourage ment of the forces of prosecution It is generally agreed that a case can never be tried as well the second time as the first the search for the truth is rendered more difficult Often of course the prosecution will overcome these handicaps and finally secure conviction of a guilty offender but disagreements nevertheless count most significantly among the causes of thwarted criminal justice There is tooc general a tendency to look upon the common law 25Laws of Ohio 1913 pp 443 444 26Laws of Ohio 1917 pp 451 452 CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 355356 ROBERT W MILLAR institution of trial by jury with a blind admiration Too generally do we penetrate the veil of tradition which surrounds it only to see its conceded virtues of its faults we remain oblivious Most of us look upon it as the only method of criminal trial consonant with free institu tions and to all its incidents including the unanimous verdict we yield the same unquestioning allegiance Yet if we look abroad at those countries on the Continent where the jury has Ibeen adopted as part of the machinery of the criminal courts we shall find no requirement that the verdict be unanimous In Scotland with its jury of fourteen a simple majority decidesand whatever may be said about criminal justice on the Continent surely none can impugn its quality in Scot land But even in our own country some departures have already been made from the traditional forms of jury trial Florida since 1877 has lived under the provision that twelve men shall constitute a jury to try all capital cases and six men shall constitute a jury to try all other criminal cases27 Many states provide that civil cases may be decided by a threefourths majority of the jurors Arizona Colorado Connecticut Idaho Mississippi Missouri Nevada Oklahoma South Dakota Utah and Washington have all taken this step Idaho provides for a verdict by fivesixths of the jury in misdemeanor cases as does perhaps one or two other Western states Oklahoma fixes three fourths as the necessary majority in misdemeanor cases and Montana provides that the verdict may be twothirds in civil cases and criminal cases not amounting to felony Utah is content with a jury of eight in courts of general jurisdiction except in capital cases It is in Louisiana however that the farthest departure has been made The Constitution of 1913 declares that the accused in cases where punish ment is not necessarily imprisonment at hard labor or death may be tried by the court without a jury or by a jury of less than twelve28 and by a subsequent provision directs that where the punishment cannot be hard labor trial may be by the judge where it must be hard labor by a jury of five all of whom must concur where it is necessarily hard labor by a jury of twelve nine of whom must concur and where it may be capital by a jury of twelve all of whom must concur29 Such a system as that obtaining in Louisiana is probably too com plicated to commend itself for general adoption There undoubtedly is need however for some change in the generally existing require ment of unanimity Just what number should be fixed upon as the necessary majority is a matter upon which individual opinions will 27Compiled Stat 1914 Vol 2 sec 3910 28Art 9 Bill of Rights 29Art 116 Bill of Rights 356 ROBERT W MILLARCRIMINAL PROCEDURE 357 differ as is also the question whether or not the present requirement should be preserved in capital cases Perhaps the most desirable recom mendation could be one to the effect that a threefourths majority should be sufficient for conviction in other than capital cases VI Should not the state have a right to appeal on questions of law equal to that of the defendarnt The various juiisdictions exhibit a wide diversity as to the right of the state in reference to review of criminal proceedings In all except Connecticut observance of the provision against double jeopardy has either denied the state any right in this regard made it an academic one or else restricted it within narrow limits Mr Clark in his Criminal Procedure thus summarizes the situation At common law the state cannot appeal or sue out a writ of error to review a judgment for the defendant in a criminal case even on demurrer much less on a verdict of acquittal  By statute in many of the states a writ of error or appeal is allowed the state from an adverse judgment or motion to quash a demurrer or motion in arrest of judgment or where a statute has been held unconstitutional and it is also allowed by statute in case of an acquittal by the jury on the facts for the purpose of determining and settling questions of law but not for the purpose of obtaining a new trial30 It would be impracticable to attempt here a review of the multi form provisions of the several states on this subject We may note however that the case of Connecticut apart the farthest stage reached is exemplified by such a statute as that obtaining in California and with or without certain differences in other Western states It pro vides that An appeal may be taken by the people 1 From an order setting aside the indictment or information 2 From a judgment for the defendant on a demurrer to the indictment accusation or information 3 From an order granting a new trial 4 From an order arresting judgment 5 From an order made after judgment affecting the substantial rights of the people3 The Federal Criminal Appeal Act of 190732 should also be noted This gives the United States the right to appeal by means of a writ of error From a decision or judgment quashing setting aside or sus S0Criminal Procedure p 393 31Deerings Penal Code sec 1238 8234 Stat 1246 3S7 CRIMINAL PROCEDURE358 ROBERT W MILLAR taining a demurrer to any indictment or any count thereof where such decision or judgment is based upon the invalidity or construction of the statute upon which the indictment is founded From a decision arresting a judgment of conviction for insuf ficiency of the indictment where such decision is based upon the inva lidity or construction of the statute upon which the indictment is founded From the decision or judgment sustaining a special plea in bar when the defendant has not been put in jeopardy Statutes such as these however fall far short of equalizing the right of the state with that of the defendant This cannot be accom plished with a revisal of the generally obtaining notion of jeopardy Connecticut at least has here pointed the way A statute passed in 1886 provided that appeals from the rulings and decisions of the Superior Court upon all questions of law arising on the trial of criminal causes may be taken by the state with the permission of the presiding judge to the Supreme Court of Errors in the same manner and to the same effect as if made by the accused In the celebrated case of State v Lee33 after acquittal of the defendant the state appealed on the ground that the trial court had improperly excluded certain evidence The appellee contended that the acquittal barred the states right of appeal inasmuch as the defendant had been in jeopardy In negativ ing this contention the court said The principle nemo bis vexare pro eadem causa gives protection against a second judicial proceeding and in the event of such pro ceeding gives to a party the right in criminal cases to the plea of autrefois acquit or autrefois convict and in civil cases to the plea of res judicata but the principle does not control the question whether the judgment pleaded in bar is in fact a legal and final judgment and has no legitimate relation to the question whether existing procedure provides for correction of errors occurring in the trial And again Judicious legislation for securing a full fair and legal trial of each criminal cause is not in derogation but in protection of individual right and is in full accord with the principle that no man shall twice be put in jeopardy for the same offense This maxim is based on the truth that a judicial proceding lawfully carried on to its conclusion by a final judgment puts the seal of finality on the controversies determined by that judgment and is not based on a theory that a person accused of crime has any natural right of exemption from those regulations of s365 Conn 265 358 ROBERT W MILLARCRIMINAL PROCEDURE 359 a judicial proceeding which the state deems necessary to make sure that the conduct and final result of that proceeding shall be in accordance with law And so the putting in jeopardy means a jeopardy which is real and has continued through every stage of one prosecution as fixed by existing laws relating to procedure while such prosecution remains undetermined the one jeopardy has not been exhausted The rational view of jeopardy thus adopted finds strong support in the dissenting opinion of Mr Justice Holmes in the case of Kepner v U S84 In that opinion concurred in by White and McKenna J J it was said    It seems to me that logically and rationally a man cannot be said to be more than once in jeopardy in the same cause however often he may be tried The jeopardy is one continuing jeopardy from its beginning to the end of the cause Everybody agrees that the prin ciple in its origin was a rule forbidding a trial in a new and independent case where a man had already been tried once But there is no rule that a man may not be tried twice in the same case    If a statute should give the right to take exceptions to the government I believe it would be impossible to maintain that the prisoner would be protected by the constitution from being tried again He no more would be put in jeopardy a second time when retried because of a mistake of law in his favor than he would be when retried for a mistake that did him harm  If what I have said is norrect no addi tional argument is necessary to show that a statute may authorize an appeal by the government from the decision by a magistrate to a higher court as well as an appeal by the prisoner    For the reasons which I have stated already a second trial in the same case must be regarded as only a continuation of the jeopardy which began with the trial below If this construction of the term double jeopardy were to find general acceptance the problem of appeal by the state would present no difficulty The opposite view however is very firmly intrenchedso firmly as to appear almost impossible of dislodgment But it ought to be dislodged and the Institute can if it chooses do here a work of exceptional value By insistence and iteration it can preach the true doctrine of double jeopardy and make plain to the public that the only obstacle to putting the state on an equal footing with the defendant in the present regard is one which lies in a comparatively narrow compass The means of correction of course will be a special problem in each jurisdiction In most it will probably require a constitutional amend 34195 U S 100 359 CRIMINAL PROCEDURE360 ROBERT W MILLAR ment to change the long settled course of decision under the jeopardy clause But no state will be able to lay claim to a really satisfactory system of criminal procedure until that correction is accomplished With it accomplished a simple statute like that of Connecticut will suffice to give the state the right to which it is entitled VII Should not the rule vwhich obtains in nearly all the states to the effect that jeopardy attaches as soon as a jury is impanelled and szworn be changed so as to postpone the attaching of jeopardy until the rendition of a verdict on the merits By a further construction of the double jeopardy clause the courts in most of the states hold that jeopardy is incurred by the accused the instant a jury is sworn Some exception is variously made for the case of disagreement of the jury and certain other causes of mistrial The case of a new trial granted on the accuseds motion is also excepted on the ground that he himself has waived the jeopardy But if the prose cutor should be obliged to enter a nolle prosequi because e g of inabil ity to find a material witness there is no help for it the accused stands acquitted and cannot again be tried for by the swearing of the jury he has been in jeopardy To illustrate A soldier in the American Expeditionary Forces in France was charged with attempt to commit rape and placed on trial before a court martial When the complain ing witness took the stand she testified that the accused had succeeded in his purpose and that a sense of shame had prevented her from dis closing this before The offense therefore was rape and not an attempt to commit rape If this case had occurred in any one of most of the state jurisdictions the offender would have gone unpunished since under the rule mentioned and the further principle that one who is tried for a lesser included offense is in jeopardy for the whole he would have been able on a subsequent prosecution for the completed crime suc cessfuly to plead that he had been once in jeopardy As far as may be judged without an exhaustive examination of their decisions Maine Vermont New Hampshire and Maryland take the view that rendition of a verdict is necessary to constitute jeopardy35 There are indications that the Supreme Court of the United States has leaned in the same direction36 In some states the double jeopardy clause appears as a prohibition of a second trial after acquittal This is true of New Jersey Rhode Island New Hampshire Michigan Missouri and Oklahoma But in the first of these only does it seem to 35State v Elden 41 Me 165 State v Chamipeau 52 Vt 513 State v Hodgkins 42 N H 474 Anderson v State 86 Md 479 36U S v Perez 9 Wheat 579 Dreyer v Illinois 187 U S 71Lovato v New Mexico 242 U S 199 360 ROBERT W MILLARCRIMINAL PROCEDURE 361 make jeopardy dependent upon acquittal or conviction37 The Missis sippi Constitution of 1890 however marks a notable advance It couples the double jeopardy clause with the provision but there must be an actual acquittal or conviction on the merits to bar another prose cution38 And this qualification has been given full effect It changes fundamentally the old rule says the Supreme Court of Mississippi in Roberts v State39 and wisely puts an end to the unmeritorious escape of persons charged with crime who had been only technically and not really tried Whether the interpretation so generally placed upon the double jeopardy maxim is in conformity with the common law admits of serious question Certainly it does not appear to be accepted in modern English practice40 In England says Mr Wharton it is settled that the maxim that a man cannot be put in peril twice for the same offense means that man cannot be tried again for an offense upon which a verdict of acquittal or conviction has been given and not that a man cannot be tried again for the same offense where the first trial has proved abortive and no verdict given41 And at all events it utterly fails to respond to present day needs A rule can never be other than unsatisfactory which under any circumstances permits a criminal to regain his freedom simply because a jury has been sworn to try him Nothing short of a verdict on the merits should suffice That a strong case can be made against the proposed change is not to be gainsaid It finds expression in the objection voiced by Mr Bishop42 Should the legislature direct what the court might as well do without the direction that whenever the evidence appeared to the judge to be insufficient to convict he should discharge the jury without taking a verdict and hold the defendant to answer before another jury no protection against any number of trials and any amount of harassment would be afforded to defendants But on the other hand no one doubts that the case may be nolle prossed at any time before the jury is sworn without causing the accused to incur jeopardy Why then should the mere swearing of the jury produce a difference Why to be concrete should there be no jeopardy at 11 a m and complete jeopardy say at 1102 a m just because the jury has been sworn in the interim The harassment which Mr Bishop 37Snmith v State 41 N J L 498 38Art 3 sec 22 3972 Miss 728 40See Archbold Criminal Pleading and Practice 23d ed pp 139141 169174 412 Criminal Procedure 10th ed p 1891 note 6 42New Criminal Law 8th ed Vol 1 sec 1019 CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 361362 ROBERT W MILLAR speaks of would be different only in degree from that which the defend ant is exposed under the present rule for theoretically that permits nolle prossing ad infinitum until a jury has been sworn It would be no greater than that experienced by the defendant in a civil cause where under the general rule the plaintiff may take a nonsuit at any time down to the retirement of the jury to consider its verdict And when we set over against the possible inconvenience which might thus be occasioned an innocent defendant the harm which is continually being inflicted on society by the chance of technical acquittal which the pres ent rule extends to the guilty we are forced to conclude that change is imperative The Institute it is submitted should earnestly advocate the adoption where necessary of a constiutional provision like that of Mississippi VIII Should there not be an abrogation of the rule prevailing in certain jurisdictions which confines the scope of a new trial granted at the defendants instance to the particular offense of which he was convicted on the first trial notwzithstanding that he stands charged with a higher degree of that offense A still further aspect of the double jeopardy rule is here involved By the weight of authority says Mr Clark if a person is convicted not of the highest offense charged but of a minor offense included in the charge as of manslaughter on an indictment for murder or simple assault on an indictment of an aggravated assault this is an acquittal of every higher offense of which he could have been convicted and in obtaining a new trial he cannot again be tried for the higher offense43 But a considerable number of jurisdictions take the opposite view44 Included among the dissentient courts is the Supreme Court of the United States which in Trono v U S45 by a vote of five to four upheld the action of the Supreme Court of the Philippines in reversing a con viction in a lower court and holding the accused guilty of a higher degree of the same offense In our opinion said the court the better doctrine is that which does not limit the court or jury upon a new trial to a consideration of the question of guilt of the lower offense of which the accused was convicted on the first trial but that the reversal of the judgment of conviction opens up the whole controversy and acts upon the original judgment as if it had never been The accused by his own motion has obtained a reversal of the whole judg ment and we see no reason why he should not upon a new trial be proceeded against as if no trial had previously taken place We do 43Criminal Procedure p 392 44See the cases cited by Mr Clark and in 16 Corpus Juris pp 260262 45199 U S 521 362 ROBERT W MILLARCRIMINAL PROCEDURE 363 not agree to the view that the accused has the right to limit his waiver as to jeopardy when he appeals from a judgment against him As the judgment stands before he appeals it is a complete bar to any further prosecution for the offense set forth in the indictment or of any lesser degree thereof No power can wrest from him the right to so use that judgment but if he chooses to appeal from it and to ask for its reversal he thereby waives if successful his right to avail himself of the former acquittal of the greater offense contained in the judgment which he has himself procured to be reversed This it is submitted expresses what ought everywhere to be the law If the finding of the jury by the defendants appeal is cancelled and obliterated for one purpose it should be for every purpose Other wise we have the anomaly of a verdict which in its expression has been set aside and in its implication has been suffered to stand Only by the most bizarre reasoning can we conceive of an implication exist ing without an expression Apart from its inherent unsoundness the majority rule gives the defendant an unfair advantage over the state encourages unfounded appeals and stands in the way of a correct administration of the criminal law Many jurisdictions repudiate the rule under criticism purely as a matter of judicial decision Others have attained the like result by leg islative aid A statute providing that the granting of a new trial places the parties in the same position as if no trial had been had finds place in New York Indiana Kansas and Kentucky46 In Missouri a modification of the double jeopardy clause of the constitution so as to permit a new trial on a proper indictment after arrest of judg ment for insufficiency of the indictment or error of law effected the repudiation47 Arizona is more explicit Section 1104 of its penal code provides that if a defendant prosecuted for an offense which includes within it lesser degrees be convicted of an offense lower than that for which he is charged and a new trial granted him or the judgment be arrested upon his motion the verdict upon the first trial shall not be considered an acquittal of the higher offense but he may upon a second or subsequent trial be convicted of the offense for which he was charged or any offense included thereon It is believed however that a statute of a general character such as the one which obtains in New York and elsewhere as above noted would be a satisfactory form of enactment to urge upon those jurisdictions which have not yet departed from the mistaken rule 46Note to People v Trono supra 4 A  E Ann Cas 779 47State v Simms 71 Mo 538 4 A  E Ann Cas 780 363 CRIMINAL PROCEDURE364 ROBERT W MILLAR IX Should not admission to bail aftcr conviction be prohibited in cases of felony This may appear as a radical suggestion but it is one which in the interest of deterrence of crime is entitled to serious consideration It cannot be doubted that the ease with which an offender in most jurisdictions can regain his liberty pending review is a constant source of evil Speaking of the institution of bail as it exists in Italy and the release of the offender after conviction Baron Garofalo says Is not this sort of thing utterly opposed to reason and common sense Whatever grounds may be urged in justification of such a system there is no gainsaying the fact that it is not natural that it is unsound that it cannot be comprehended by the popular intelligence least of all by that of a Southern nation How is it to be supposed that a people with the meridional characteristics of little foresight of little sensibility to that which is not present and immediate can be impressed by the men ace of an imprisonment which is not to take effect until after the lapse of an indefinite periodone or two years or even more in the event of a new trial being ordered by a higher court Remote menaces of this description may not be without influence upon people of a cold and calculating turn of mind Up to a certain point they are understandable in the North but in the South to apply Spencers expression there must be penalties which are severe prompt and specific enough to be vividly conceived 48 It may be questioned whether the learned Baron has not made undue allowance for the people of the North Certainly in the United States with its mixed population the necessity that pun ishment be capable of vivid conception is just as pressing as it is in Italy And to the extent that the institution of release on bail blurs that conception is it subject to just criticism There is apparently but one state in the Union which does not allow bail pending appealthat is Kentucky which has a statute declaring that after conviction the defendant cannot be admitted to bail49 Elsewhere bail seems to be allowable after conviction under greater or less restrictions In one class of states it is allowable in the discretion of the court where the offense was originally a bailable one This is true probably of the greater number of jurisdictions Another class of states makes it of right where the punishment is by fine and discre tionary in all other except capital cases California Idaho Montana and Nevada follow this rule In other states it is of right except where the punishment is death or life imprisonment This is true of Indiana 48Criminology Modern Crim Science Series pp 3489 49Sec 75 Title V Code of Practice in Criminal Cases Carrolls Kentucky Codes Vol I p 675 364 ROBERT W MILLARCRIMINAL PROCEDURE 365 and Oklahoma Oregon makes it of right except in cases of murder treason or personal injury likely to cause death where if death ensues the offense would be first degree murder In Texas there is a right to bail on appeal only when the punishment does not exceed fifteen years imprisonment Whatever may be said of permitting release on bail after convic tion in the discretion of the court the giving of the defendant an absolute right to it as do some of these jurisdictions where the pun ishment stops short of life imprisonment is little less than playing into the hands of the criminal classes The whole matter of bail in our sys tem if we stop to consider it negatives equality of treatment of defend ants It makes provisional release depend upon possession of property or propertied friends The accused with this advantage escapes the confinement that his less fortunate fellow must endure But we tolerate this essential inequality and will continue to tolerate it pending con viction because of the presumption that the accused is innocent Where however conviction ensues with a sentence of imprisonment should not that presumption be regarded as sufficiently rebutted to restrain the accused of his liberty Clearly it should be so far as regards admission to bail as a matter of right We can and should take steps everywhere as has been done in many states to credit on the defendants term of imprisonment the period spent in confinement pend ing review And with this as the rule there is good reason for con tending that we should go to the full extent and forbid such release even as a matter of judicial discretion The argument here is prin cipally that of Garofalo namely that the returning of the accused to that society which a jury has solemnly said he has outraged conveys to the ignorant the idea that he has successfully flouted the law and that they too may do so with impunity And it may be added even those who are not ignorant cannot escape the impression that the prosecu tion has degenerated into a mere law suit with the state a sort of moot and academic contest To use a current term the proceeding gives rise to the notion that the state has no teeth The fact that if the con viction be affirmed he will be retaken into custody and made to serve his sentence does not mitigate to any appreciable extent the effect thus produced For his return to freedom after conviction had an element of the spectacular which the later circumstance wholly lacks On the other hand there is the danger of injustice being com mitted in the confinement of an accused who is ultimately released by action of the reviewing court While this argument loses some of its force from the consideration that if the accused be unable to give bail 365 CRIMINAL PROCEDURE366 ROBERT W MILLAR he is exposed to the same injustice under the existing system it may nevertheless be strong enough to require a more conservative recom mendation with relation to bail after conviction than that of its total prohibition X Should not the state see to it that a defendant may appeal without advancing costs irrespective of his pecuniary condition Most of the faults of the existing system inure to the benefit of the defendant But there are some which operate to his prejudice Not the least of these is the fact that in various jurisdictions he cannot appeal without a considerable expenditure of money Sometimes he is required to advance clerks costs in order to have his case docketed in the upper court but his chief grievance in this regard concerns the preparation of the record and the expenses of printing incident to appeal Where the burden of paying for these items is cast upon him the effect is a virtual denial of justice A number of states have adopted measures by way of remedy A favorite form of enactment is one which relieves the defendant from some or all of the expenses of appeal upon his showing of inability to pay Iowa Montana Oklahoma Texas Utah and Washington have statutes to this effect50 Arizona Missouri Nebraska Oregon and Virginia are in the same or substantially the same case South Dakota provides that the state furnish a transcript of the proceedings when the court deems it essential to the protection of the defendant In other jurisdictions the clerk of the lower court is required to prepare the record without charge irrespective of the appellants ability to pay This is true for example of Nevada and North Dakota West Virginia provides inter alia for printing the record at the expense of the state Many other provisions on the present subject are to be found in dif ferent jurisdictions the exact effect of which as indeed of at least some of the statutes directing preparation of the record without charge is difficult to estimate in view of the divergencies in appellate procedure Certain it is however that there are still sundry jurisdictions in the same case as Illinois where the defendant who cannot obtain funds to pay for a transcript of the testimony has no alternative but to submit to his sentence however erroneous may have been the trial proceedings The ideal system of criminal appeal of course would be something like that obtaining in the army There every record of trial by general courtmartial goes up to the proper authorities for review Such a review regardless of the defendants volition may not be practically desirable in the criminal justice of civil life but one feature of it com 5017 C J 103 366 ROBERT W MILLAR CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 367 mends itself for universal adoptionthat is the transcribing and cer tifying in all cases of the evidence heard on the trial It would be a distinct advantage to all concerned if a record were thus to be made of the evidence wholly apart from any question of appeal Maine now requires this in murder cases and no doubt there are other jurisdic tions where it is done But it is probably true in the majority of juris dictions that the stenographers notes are not written up at least for official certification until there is need for a bill of exceptions or the equivalent The practice suggested would facilitate the exemption of the defendant from costs for the original transcript itself could be laid before the appellate court It is clear that statutes basing the exemption upon a showing of indigence are neither adequate nor just So long as the state permits a revision of criminal sentences so long should it make good the promise that justice shall be free No legislation can be satisfactory which does not relieve the appealing defendant from advancing costs of any description whether he be pauper or millionaire The enactments of those states which accomplish this should be pressed upon the attention of their backward neighbors

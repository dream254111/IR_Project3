J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,108223,RESEARCHES ON THE TIDES TWELFTH SERIES ON THE LAWS OF THE RISE AND FALL OF THE SEAS SURFACE DURING EACH TIDE,I206995, 255  XIV RESEARCHES ON THE TIDESTWELFTH SERIES ON THE LAWS OF THE RISE AND FALL OF THE SEAS SURFACE DURING EACH TIDE BY THE REV W WHEWELL BD FRS FELLOW OF TRINITY COLLEGE CAMBRIDGE RECEIVED JUNE 13READ JUNE 18 1840 THE SUBJECT OF THE PRESENT COMMUNICATION IS DIFFERENT IN ITS NATURE FROM THOSE OF PREVIOUS MNERNOIRS ON THE TIDES PRESENTED BY ME AND PRINTED BY THE SOCIETY SINCE IT REFERS NOT TO COMPARISON OF THE TIMES AND HEIGHTS OF DIFFERENT TIDES BUT TO THE RATE OF THE RISE AND FALL OF THE SURFACE OF THE WATER IN SUCCESSIVE STAGES OF THE SAME TIDE THIS INQUIRY HAS OFTEN BEEN PROSECUTED AT PARTICULAR PLACES BY NAVAL OBSERVERS AND IS OF VERY MATERIAL IMPORTANCE TO NAVIGATION FOR EVEN SUPPOSING THE TIME AND HEIGHT OF HIGH WATER TO BE KNOWN IT IS STILL OFTEN REQUISITE FOR NAUTICAL PURPOSES TO KNOW THE HEIGHT OF THE WATER AT A GIVEN INTERVAL BEFORE OR AFTER THE MOMENT OF HIGH WATER AND THIS INQUIRY MAY BE THE MORE USEFUL INASMUCH AS THE LAWS OF RISE AND FALL OF THE SURFACE ARE NEARLY THE SAME AT ALL PLACES THE DIFFERENCES BEING FOR THE MOST PART OF SUCH A KIND AS CAN BE ASCERTAINED AND ALLOWED FOR WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY HENCE THESE LAWS ONCE STATED WILL BE APPLICABLE ON EVERY COAST AND THE KNOWLEDGE OF THEM MAY SUPERSEDE THOSE LABORIOUS TRAINS OF OBSERVATION WHICH HAVE OFTEN BEEN INSTITUTED IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN THE LAWS AT PARTICULAR PLACES THE MATERIALS OF THE PRESENT INVESTIGATION WHICH IS PRINCIPALLY FOUNDED UPON OB SERVATION ARE THE FOLLOWINGFIVE MONTHS TIDE OBSERVATIONS MADE AT PLYMOUTH IN WHICH BESIDES THE TIME AND HEIGHT OF HIGH AND LOW WATER THE TIME OF THE SURFACE PASSING TWO LINES ABOVE THE LEVEL OF MEAN WATER WAS CAREFULLY OBSERVED THESE LATTER OBSERVATIONS BEING MADE AT MY REQUEST BY DIRECTION OF THE LORDS COMMISSIONERS OF THE ADMIRALTYTHREE MONTHS OBSERVATIONS TAKEN OUT OF A LARGER SERIES MADE AT LIVERPOOL UNDER THE DIRECTION OF CAPT DENHAM RN IN WHICH THE HEIGHT OF THE SURFACE WAS NOTED EVERY HALF HOURAND TWELVE MONTHS OBSERVATIONS MADE AT BRISTOL BY MR BUNT BY MEANS OF HIS TIDEGAUGE THE LATTER OBSERVATIONS WERE REDUCED BY MR BUNT HIMSELF THE OTHERS WERE DISCUSSED UNDER MY DIRECTION BY MR DESSIOU AND MR ROSS OF THE HYDROGRAPHERS OFFICE

HALFDAY THE HEIGHT OF THIS POINT ABOVE A HORIZONTAL LINE WILL REPRESENT THE HEIGHT OF THE SURFACE OF THE WATER SUPPOSING THE VELOCITY AND THE RADIUS TO BE DULY ADJUSTED BUT THE RADIUS DEPENDS UPON THE TOTAL RISE OF THE SURFACE AND THE VELOCITY DEPENDS ON THE LENGTH OF A TIDAL DAY AND BOTH THESE QUANTITIES ARE DIFFETENT AT DIFFERENT PERIODS OF A LUNATION HENCE OUR LINE OF SINES WILL EVEN THEORETICALLY REQUIRE SOME MODIFICATION LET THE HEIGHT OF THE SURFACE ABOVE A GIVEN ZERO LINE BE Y K  H COS  T WHERE R IS THE LENGTH OF THE TIDAL HALFDAY AND T THE TIME FROM HIGH WATER 2 H THE RISE

PLYMOUTH OBSERVATIONS OF HEIGHT C MUST BE ABOUT  SINCE THE CURVE OF RISE AND FALL AT SPRING TIDES HAS ITS AMPLITUDE THE SMALLEST AND ITS ORDINATE THE LARGEST IT WILL INTERSECT ALL THE OTHERS THE POINTS OF INTERSECTION WILL BE A LITTLE ABOVE MEAN WATER WE HAVE NOW TO INQUIRE WHETHER THESE FEATURES APPEAR IN THE EMPIRICAL LAWS OF THE TIDES AS COLLECTED FROM DISCUSSION OF THE OBSERVATIONS ALREADY SPOKEN OF NAMELY WHETHER THE CURVE OF RISE AND FALL IS THE FIGURE OF SINES AND WHETHER ITS MAXIMUM ORDINATE H AND ITS AMPLITUDE R FOLLOW LAWS RESEMBLING THOSE GIVEN BY THE THEORY IF THIS IS THE CASE THE INTERSECTIONS OF THE CURVES WILL ALSO AGREE WITH THE THEORY 1 THE EMPIRICAL CURVE OF RISE AND FALL AGREES VERY NEARLY WITH THE FIGURE OF SINES AT ALL THE THREE PLACES HERE CONSIDERED THE FIGURE WAS DETERMINED DIFFERENTLY AT THE DIFFERENT PLACES AT LIVERPOOL WHERE THE HEIGHT OF THE WATER WAS OBSERVED EVERY HALF HOUR THE TOTAL CURVE WAS GIVEN EMPIRICALLY AND IS EXHIBITED IN PLATE X FIG 1 THE CURVES BEING THROWN INTO TWO GROUPS ACCORDING TO HOURS OF MOONS TRANSIT TO AVOID CONFUSION AT PLYMOUTH THE TIME AND HEIGHT OF HIGH WATER WERE OBSERVED AND ALSO THE TIME OF PASSING TWO HORIZONTAL LINES M AND N SITUATED NEAR MEAN WATER AT NINE FEET TEN INCHES AND TEN FEET TEN INCHES RESPECTIVELY ABOVE THE ZERO OF THE SCALE BY THIS MEANS FIVE POINTS WERE GIVEN IN EACH CURLVE THE OBSERVATIONS BEING ARRANGED ACCORDING TO THE HOUR OF TRANSIT AND THE CURVES WERE DRAWN BY THE EYE THROUGH THESE POINTS AS MAY BE SEEN IN FIG 2 AT BRISTOL THE TIDEGAUGE DID NOT ALLOW THE RISE AND FALL TO BE OBSERVED MORE THAN HALF WAY DOWN FROM HIGH WATER TO MEAN WATER BUT THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT IN ITS GE NERAL LAW OF VARIATION THE CURVE APPROACHED NEARLY TO THE FIGURE OF SINES 2 BUT IN ALL THESE CASES MORE OR LESS THERE IS A DEVIATION OF THE EMPIRICAL FROM THE THEORETICAL FORM WHICH DESERVES NOTICE INSTEAD OF BEING A SYMMETRICAL CURVE MDCCCXL 2 L 257258 THE REV W WHEWELLS RESEARCHES ON THE TIDES SERIES XII THE RISE AND THE FALL TAKING PLACE AT THE SAME RATE THE EMPIRICAL CURVE OF RISE AND FALL IS UNSYMMETRICAL THE FALL BEING MORE RAPID THAN THE RISE IN GENERAL THOUGH SOME TIMES THE REVERSE OCCURS BY THIS MEANS THE SUMMIT OF THE CURVE OF RISE AND FALL IS DISPLACED AND IS POSITED TO THE RIGHT OR LEFT OF THE POSITION GIVEN BY BISECTING THE INTERVAL OF THE TIMES AT WHICH THE SURFACE IN RISING AND IN FALLINGPASSES SOME LOWER LINE AS THE LINE OF MEAN WATER THIS DISPLACEMENT OF THE SUMMIT I HAVE TAKEN AT LIVERPOOL FOR TWO LINES M AND N AT THE HEIGHTS OF FIFTEEN FEET AND SEVENTEEN FEET ABOVE THE ZERO AT PLYMOUTH FOR TWO LINES M AND N WHICH AS ABOVE STATED ARE AT NINE FEET TEN INCHES AND TEN FEET TEN INCHES ABOVE THE ZERO IN THESE CASES THE LINES M AND N ARE VERY NEAR MEAN WATER AT BRISTOL AS I HAVE SAID THE LOWER OBSERVED HEIGHT WAS HALF WAY FROM MEAN WATER TO HIGH WATER THE DISPLACEMENT OF THE SUMMIT BEING ARRANGED ACCORDING TO THE HOUR OF MOONS TRANSIT THERE IS NO OBVIOUS AGREEMENT IN THE FORM OF THE RESULT FOR DIFFERENT PLACES FIG 3 AND 4 GIVE THE CURVES WHICH EXPRESS THESE RESULTS FOR PLYMOUTH AND LIVERPOOL BRISTOL IS NOT READILY COMPARABLE WITH THESE FROM THE NATURE OF THE OBSERVATIONS 3 THE VARIATIONS IN THE LENGTH OF THE TIDAL HALFDAY FROM LOW WATER TO LOW WATER WERE ALSO EXAMINED IT APPEARED THAT AT LIVERPOOL AND AT PLYMOUTH THE VARIATIONS IN THIS ELEMENT FOLLOWED NEARLY THE LAW INDICATED BY THE THEORY WHICH INDEED MAY BE CONSIDERED AS HAVING BEEN PREVIOUSLY SUFFICIENTLY PROVED BY THE NEAR ACCORDANCE OF THE OBSERVED WITH THE THEORETICAL TIMES OF HIGH AND LOW WATER AN ACCORDANCE WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN ESTABLISHED BY THE DISCUSSION OF THE OBSERVATIONS AT LIVERPOOL LONDON AND OTHER PLACES 4 THE SAME MAY BE SAID OF THE VARIATIONS IN THE HEIGHT OT HIGH AND LOW WATER DURING A SEMILUNATION IT HAD ALREADY BEEN REPEATEDLY SHOWN THAT IF WE ASSUME A PROPER VALUE OF C THESE AS OBSERVED AGREE WITH GREAT ACCURACY WITH THE THEORY AT EVERY PLACE YET EXAMINED 5 HENCE AS I HAVE SAID THE INTERSECTIONS OF THE CURVES OF RISE AND FALL BELONGING TO DIFFERENT HOURS FOLLOW IN THE CURVES GIVEN BY OBSERVATIONS NEARLY THE THEORETICAL LAW THUS THESE INTERSECTIONS ALL TAKE PLACE NEARLY AT MEAN WATER BUT OCCUR A LITTLE HIGHER AND NEARER HIGH WATER THAN THE HEIGHT AND TIME OF MEAN WATER 6 BUT YET THE WANT OF EXACT SYMMETRY IN THE EMPIRICAL CURVES OCCASIONS SOME PECULIAR FEATURES IN THE INTERSECTIONS OF THESE CURVES THUS AT LEAST FOR MANY OF THE HOURS OF TRANSIT THE INTERSECTIONS OF THE CURVES OF RISE AND FALL ARE HIGHER AND NEARER THE TIME OF HIGH WATER IN DESCENDING THAN IN ASCENDING THIS MAY BE SEEN IN THE LIVERPOOL CURVES IN WHICH MANY OF THE ASCENDING INTERSECTIONS FALL VERY NEAR THE LINE M WHILE THE CORRESPONDING DESCENDING INTERSECTIONS FALL NEAR THE LINE N 7 SINCE THE TIME OF ASCENDING IS GREATER AND THE HEIGHT ASCENDED LESS AT NEAPS THAN AT SPRINGS IT IS PLAIN THAT THE VELOCITY OF ASCENT MUST BE GREATER AND THE TIME OF ASCENDING A GIVEN SPACE LESS AT SPRINGS THAN AT NEAPS THE SAME IS THE CASE OF DESCENT AND HENCE THE TIMES OF ASCENDING FROM M TO N VARY AND THIS VARIATION APPEARS EMINENTLY IN THE RATE OF THE SURFACES ASCENDING ORL DESCENDING ABOUT MEANON THE LAWS OF RISE AND FALL OF THE SURFACE WATER I HAVE COMPARED THE TIMES OF ASCENDING A GIVEN SPACE FROM M TO N BOTH AT LIVERPOOL AND AT PLYMOUTH BUT I HAVE NOT THOUGHT IT NECESSARY TO GIVE THE DIAGRAM WHICH EXHIBITS THE RESULT 8 NEAR MEAN WATER THE SURFACE IS RISING OR FALLING WITH THE GREATEST VELOCITY HENCE THE OBSERVATION OF THE TIME AT WHICH THE SURFACE PASSES THE LINE M OR N IS FAR MORE PRECISE THAN THE OBSERVATION OF HIGH AND LOW WATER THE OBSERVATIONS AT PLY MOUTH WERE MADE TO SECONDS AND THE HYPOTHETICAL TIME OF HIGH WATER OBTAINED BY BISECTING THE INTERVAL FROM M RISING TO M FALLING AGREED WITH THE TIME OBTAINED BY BISECTING THE INTERVAL BETWEEN N RISING AND N FALLING GENERALLY WITHIN A MINUTE OR TWO AND OFTEN WITHIN A FEW SECONDS 9 SINCE THIS IS THE CASE IT MIGHT BE MADE A QUESTION WHETHER IT WOULD NOT BE BETTER TO OBSERVE THE TIME OF THE SURFACE PASSING M OR N OR BOTH THAN TO OBSERVE THE TIME OF HIGH WATER AND LOW WATER OF COURSE IT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WOULD STILL BE REQUISITE TO OBSERVE THE HEIGHT OF HIGH WATER AND LOW WATER BUT THIS IS VERY EASILY DONE EITHER BY THE EYE OR BY SELFREGISTERING MACHINERY THERE ARE SOME CIRCUM STANCES WHICH APPEAR TO CONFIRM THE CONJECTURE THAT THIS WOULD BE AN INLPROVEMENT IN TIDE OBSERVATIONS FOR INSTANCE THE DIURNAL INEQUALITY OF THE TIMES OF HIGH WATER AT PLYMOUTH IS MUCH MORE DISTINCTLY SEEN IN THE BISECTED TITNES THAN IN THE OBSERVED TIMES BUT ON EXAMINING THE GENERAL RUN OF THE OBSERVATIONS IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT THE BISECTED TIMES ARE MORE REGULAR THAN THE OBSERVED TIMES SINCE THE EXACTNESS WITH WHICH IT IS POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE BISECTED TIME OF HIGH WATER HAS NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN PRACTICALLY SHOWN I SHALL GIVE AT THE END OF THIS ME MOIR THE COMPARISON OF THE BISECTED TIMNES OBTAINED FROM THE LINES M AND N AT PLY MOUTH WITH EACH OTHER AND WITH THE OBSERVED TIMES OF HIGH WATER 10 AS WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN THE DISPLACEMENT OF THE SUMMIT OF THE CURVES OF RISE AND FALL THAT IS THE TIME BY WHBICH THE OBSERVED TINME OF BIGH WATER DIFFERS FROM THE BISECTED TIME APPEARS TO FOLLOW DIFFERENT LAWS AT DIFFERENT PLACES AND THEREFORE PRO BABLY DEPENDS UPON LOCAL CIRCUMSTANCES IN GENERAL IN THE CASES HITHERTO EXAMINED THE OBSERVED TIME IS LATER THAN THE BISECTED TIME THAT IS THE SURFACE DESCENDS MORE RAPIDLY THAN IT ROSE BUT BOTH AT LIVERPOOL AND PLYMOUTH THIS DIFFERENCE VANISHES VERY NEARLY AT ABOUT SEVEN HOURS TRANSIT THUS AT NEAP TIDES THE CURVE OF RISE AND FALL IS NEARLY SYMMETRICAL 11 THE LAWS WHICH WE HAVE INVESTIGATED HAVE BEEN REFERRED TO THE HOURS OF THE MOONS TRANSIT THESE HOURS BEING RECKONED FROM 1 TO 12 BUT AT PLYMOUTH IF WE REFER THE OBSERVATIONS TO HOURS OF MOONS TRANSIT FROM 1 TO 24 THUS DISTINGUISHING SUPERIOR FROM INFERIOR TRANSITS WE FIND A GREAT DIFFERENCE IN THE EFFECTS BELONGING TO CORRESPONDING TRANSITS AS 6H AND 18H 7H AND 19H AND THE LIKE THIS DIFFERENCE AP PARENTLY ARISES FROM A DIURNAL INEQUALITY AND WOULD DISAPPEAR WHEN THE MOONS NODES CAME INTO ANOTHER POSITION LONDON JUNE 12 1840 2L2 259260 THE REV W WHEWELLS RESEARCHES ON THE TIDES SERIES XII PS I WILL ADD TO THE ABOVE MEMOIR TWO TABLES GIVING THE HEIGHT OF THE SURFACE OF THE SEA AT ANY TIME AS AFFECTED BY THE TIDE AT PLYMOUTH AND AT LIVERPOOL IN CON STRUCTING THESE TABLES I HAVE SUPPOSED THE RISE AND FALL OF THE SURFACE TO FOLLOW THE LAW OF THE SINE OF THE TIME FROM MEAN WATER AS ALREADY EXPLAINED FOR ALTHOUGH THERE EXISTS IN MANY PLACES A DISPLACEMENT OF THE SUMMIT OF THE CURVE OF RISE AND FALL THIS DISPLACEMENT IS SMALL AND WOULD NOT MUCH AFFECT THE HEIGHT AT ANY TIME WHETHER IT ARISE FROM THE COMBINATION OF THE SOLAR WITH THE LUNAR TIDEWAVE OR OF THE DIURNAL WITH THE SEMIDIURNAL WAVE OR FROM THE FORM OF THE CHANNEL AND LOCAL CIRCUMSTANCES IT MAY BE DISREGARDED OR POSTPONED IN A STATEMENT LIKE THE PRESENT THE HEIGHT IS GIVEN IN THESE TABLES ACCORDING TO HOURS BEFORE AND AFTER HIGH WATER THE CURVE BEING SUPPOSED SYMMETRICAL AS WE HAVE SAID THE UNIT OF HEIGHT EX PRESSED IN THE TABLE BY 1000 IS THE HEIGHT OF THE HIGH WATER AT SPRING TIDES ABOVE THE MEAN WATER OR HALF THE TOTAL RISE OF THE SURFACE AT SPRING TIDES THE TABLE MUST BE ADAPTED TO ANY PARTICULAR PLACE BY MULTIPLYING EACH TABULAR NUMBER BY THIS QUANTITY THE HEIGHT OF SPRING TIDE HIGH WATER ABOVE MEAN WATER FOR THE PLACE CUTTING OFF THREE DECIMAL PLACES THE HIGHEST SPRING TIDES AND THE LOWEST NEAP TIDES TAKE PLACE AT DIFFERENT INTERVALS AFTER THE MOONS SYZYGIES AND QUADRATURES AT DIFFERENT PLACES THE INTERVAL VARYING FROM A FEW HOURS TO A FEW DAYS IN LIKE MANNER THE TIDES CORRESPONDING TO THE MOONS OCTANTS WHEN HER TRANSIT TAKES PLACE THREE HOURS AFTER THE SUNS FOLLOW THE TIME OF THE OCTANTS AT DIFFERENT INTERVALS AT DIFFERENT PLACES BUT THEY MAY BE VERY INTELLIGIBLY DESIGNATED AS OCTANT TIDES WHICH TERM IS EMPLOYED IN THE TABLES IN THE TABLE FOR PLYMOUTH THE SPRING TIDE IS TO THE NEAP TIDE AS 5 TO 3 WHICH SUPPOSES THE SOLAR TIDE TO BE ONEFOURTH OF THE LUNAR TIDE IN THE TABLE FOR LIVERPOOL THE SPRING TIDE IS TO THE NEAP TIDE AS 7 TO 3 WHICH SUPPOSES THE SOLAR TIDE TO BE TWO FIFTHS OF THE LUNAR THESE ARE THE PROPORTIONS GIVEN BY OBSERVATION AT THOSE PLACES I WILL ADD AN EXAMPLE OF THE USE OF THE FOLLOWING TABLES LET IT BE PROPOSED TO FJIND THE HEIGHT OF THE SURFACE AT PLYMOUTH 1 HOUR BEFORE HIGH WATER AT OCTANT TIDES THE RANGE OF SPRING TIDES AT PLYMOUTH IS SIXTEEN FEET HENCE THE UNIT OF HEIGHTS IS EIGHT FEET AND AT 11 HOUR BEFORE HIGH WATER THE TABULAR NUMBER BY INTERPOLATION IS 515 HENCE THE HEIGHT ABOVE MEAN WATER IS 412 FEET OR FOUR FEET ONE INCH

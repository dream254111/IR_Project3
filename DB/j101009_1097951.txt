j101009,The Virginia Law Register,1097951,Richmond Union Passenger Railway Company v New York  Sea Beach Railway Company Decided at Richmond December 2 1897,i245847,1898 DIGEST OF OTHER RECENT VIRGINIA DECISIONS BOOKER V DONOHOEDecided at Richmond December 2 1897 Keith P 1 PLEADINGCounts in tort and upon contract in same declarationAction to re cover fees of de facto officer Counts in tort and upon contract cannot be combined in the same declaration but a count which simply sets out the details of an intrusion into an office and claims of a de facto officer the emoluments of an office which have been illegally collected by him and avers an indebitatus assumpsit to the de jure officer cannot be said to be a count in tort 2 PLEADINGAssumpsitDeclarationAccount The bill of particulars or account required to be filed with a declaration in assumpsit is no part of the declaration 3 PLEADINGAssumpsitAction to recover emoluments of officeDe jure office Taking oaths and giving bondCase at barMeasure of damages Assumpsit is the proper remedy for the recovery by a de jure officer of the emoluments of the office illegally collected by a de facto officer A de jure officer is entitled to the emoluments of the office of which he has been deprived from the date on which he was entitled to enter upon the discharge of the duties of the office and it is not necessary as a condition precedent to his right of recovery that he should have qualified himself to discharge the duties of the office by taking the oaths and giv ing the bond required by law In the case at bar the measure of damages of the plaintiff who was deprived of the office of clerk of the county court if he proves the case set forth in the declaration is so much of the exofficio allowance to the clerk as was collected by the defendant and the amount of fees received by him as such clerk less the necessary expense of earning them unless the defendant was guilty of fraud in procuring the certificate of election in which event no deduction should be allowed RICHMOND UNION PASSENGER RAILWAY COMPANY V NEW YORK  SEA BEACH RAILWAY COMPANYDecided at Richmond December 2 1897 Keith P Absent Cardwell J 1 PRocEssService on corporation which has ceased to exist Service of process on the late president of a corporation which has ceased to exist is sufficient though the process might have been served by publication as prescribed by section 1103 of the Code The latter method is simply cumulative 2 PLEADINGGeneral issueSpecial pleas It is not error to refuse to allow special pleas to be filed which set up no defences except such as can be presented under the general issue 3 PRINCIPAL AND AGENTRatification of act of unauthorized agent The act of an unauthorized agent subsequently ratified by the principal is as binding as though previously authorized 4 EVIDENCETo whom credit extendedPlaintiffs book of original entry Where a defendant denies liability on a contract of which he has accepted the benefit on the ground that credit was not extended to him but to his alleged agent the books of original entry of the plaintiff are admissible in evidence to show that the credit was extended to the defendant and that the accounts sued on were charged to him at the time of the contract 41VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER 5 EVIDENcEDealings between two corporationsDeath of agent of one In an action by a corporation against another corporation the death of the agent who negotiated the contract on behalf of the defendant does not disqualify from testi fying an agent of the plaintiff who did not negotiate the contract on its behalf even if it disqualified the plaintiffs negotiating agent A letter signed A by B is As letter 6 EVIDENCEContract for reasonable wagesEvidence of what is reasonable In an action on a contract whereby the plaintiff agrees to furnish to the defendants engineers  at a reasonable rate of wages it is competent for the plaintiff to prove what would be a reasonable charge for the engineers furnished 7 VARIANCEDeclaration and proofAction against one account against two There is no variance between the allegation and the proof where the the declara tion avers a contract with the defendant and the proof shows that the contract was made through an agent who disclosed the defendant as his principal The account filed with the declaration was against the defendant and another and is sufficient the plaintiff having offered to strike out the name of the other and it not having been done because the defendant objected 8 CORPORATrONS  Denial of existence  Sufficiency of afdavit An affidavit which denies the existence of any such corporation as the defendant corporation at the time of the institution of plaintiffs suit but does not deny the existence of such corporation at the time of the contract sued on is not sufficient under section 3280 of the Code to put the plaintiff to proof of the existence of such a corporation 9 PRINCIPAL AND AGENTAgent contracting for disclosed principalPesump tionBurden of proofCase at barPrior suit against agentElection An agent who fully discloses his agency and the name of his principal and contracts only as the agent of his principal incurs no personal responsibility While he may bind himself personally the presumption is otherwise and the burden of proof is on him who undertakes to establish the agents personal liability In the case at bar it is clear that the agent contracted tor a disclosed principal that credit was extended to the principal the benefits of the contract were accepted by the prin cipal and there is no personal responsibility on the agent The mere fact that the plaintiff instituted a suit on the contract against the agent which suit has never been prosecuted cannot relieve the principal from liability on the contract In this case there were not  two concurrent debtors for the same debt NAPIER V PRISON ASSOCIATION OF VIRGINIADecided at Rich mond December 9 1897Harrison J

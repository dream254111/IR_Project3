j100249,The Journal of Religion,1195396,New Books on Early Christianity,i251281,NEW BOOKS ON EARLY CHRISTIANITY Three books of note dealing with the history of early Christianity have recently appeared One of these is the concluding volume of Johannes Weiss Das Urchristentum another is a group of five popular lectures by Kirsopp Lake2 and the third is the initial volume in a pro jected series of elaborate studies edited by F J Foakes Jackson and Kirsopp Lake3 Professor Weiss of Heidelberg died on August 24 1914 less than a year after the publication of the first part of his book But at that time the undertaking had progressed so far that it was found practicable to have an editor complete the work as originally planned In the matter of actual composition pages 555672 come from the hand of the editor but his task has been done so well that probably no reader will feel any break in continuity or any lessening of interest in passing the point where the pen was dropped by the author and taken up by the editor As originally designed this history of early Christianity aimed to be a semipopular presentation embodying the results of years of scientific Das Urchristentum Von

the life and religion of Paul furnish the chief theme and claim the bulk of the space It is in this portion of the subject that the author is at his best He knows how to study Paul not merely as a theologian but as a living and acting individual whose religion was a product of contacts with a real world of immediate experience Account is taken of his debt to both his Jewish and his gentile environment Various and complex factors are recognized as entering into the making of the Christian apostle but all these heritages are thought to have been fused into a unity through Pauls own personal religious experience and ethical sincerity Professor Lakes Landmarks consists of the Haskell Lectures delivered at Oberlin in i9i9 and is in substance only a popularization of the section on Primitive Christianity in the larger work on Beginnings Therefore his contribution to the subject in hand may be ascertained sufficiently from an examination of the latter volume The plan of the series as announced by the publishers assigns three volumes to the interpretation of Acts as follows I The Jewish Gentile and Christian Backgrounds II Literary Criticism of Acts III Text and Commentary The first main division of Volume I is given up to a description of the Jewish world of early Christian times Professors Jackson and Lake writing jointly give an account of Jewish political history Mr C G Montefiore writes a characteristically scholarly and well balanced chapter on the Spirit of Judaism to which the editors add a survey of varieties of thought and practice in Judaism and a sketch of Jewish life in the Diaspora The salient features of Jewish history particularly in its religious aspects are set forth compactly but clearly and in terms of the latest results of scientific research Now and then a novel interpretation is put forth as when it is suggested that according to Josephus John the Baptist at first addressed himself only to ascetics p 102 or that it is incorrect to apply the term Zealots to the followers of Judas of Galilee who were called by Josephus adherents of the Fourth Philosophy Yet it is conceded that Judas propagated the doctrines afterwards adopted by the Zealots in 66 AD p 12 The gentile background for a study of Acts is presented in two sections one by Professor H T F Duckworth of Trinity College Toronto on the Roman system of provincial administration and the other by Professor Clifford H Moore of Harvard University on life and thought within the Roman Empire Each essay is the work of an expert and is concerned with a topic of prime importance for the interpretation of Acts Professor Duckworth gives an array of pertinent informationBOOK REVIEWS 99 regarding the essential features of the provincial system of governunent under which Christians lived in gentile territory Fortunately the operations of the conciliaa subject too often neglected by students of early Christianityhave been described with some detail This infor mation is especially valuable for an understanding of the history of emperorworship and the relations of Christianity to the Roman government Professor Moore has not been so happy in the selection of topics directly contributory to the interpretation of Acts His comparatively lengthy account of the philosophies of the period is in itself excellent but rather remote from the interests of those Christians whose life is reflected in the Book of Acts except perhaps chapter 7  A few valuable pages are devoted to an exposition of the mystery religions but the chapter is not an adequate introduction to the dominant religious interests and activities that made up the everyday experiences of the common man in those particular gentile circles from which the Christian movement drew its converts during the early decades of its history In the third main division of the book under the title Primitive Christianity the editors jointly write four chapters dealing respectively with i the career of Jesus 2 the work of the disciples in Jerusalem and the beginnings of preaching among Gentiles 3 the growth of speculation on the subjects of the spirit the church and baptism and 4 Christology One distinctive phase of these chapters is a disposition to distrust that interpretation of Jewish messianism and eschatology of which Schtirer and Charles are the bestknown modern representatives and to incline instead toward that type of opinion expounded by J Klausner in his dissertation Die messianischen Vorstellungen desjiidischen Volkes im Zeitallter der Tannaiten Perhaps limits of space prevented a sufficiently elaborate display of evidence to effect a convincing solution of so moot a problem but to have the question opened anew may prove well worth while It is interesting to note the drift away from the view current among the modern eschatologists that Jesus identified himself with the Son of Man of Jewish apocalyptic writings or in fact that he claimed messiahship for himself in any sense of the word p 283 As a whole this book is always stimulating and if sometimes more interesting than convincing it is probably only what good Prolego mena should bean accurate statement of matters no longer open to question and an arresting presentation of debatable issues The appearance of future volumes in the series will be eagerly awaited Perhaps it is not out of place in these days of the high cost of printing to congratulate the publishers upon the pleasing form of the book TheIoo THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION attention of the proofreaders should be called to a particular typo graphical error four times repeated in the citation of authorities pp 277 298 325 Landmarks p 20 the promise of a bibliography p 81 to appear at the end of the volume is not fulfilled and apparently the subheading on page 171 should be carried into the margin But all in all the volume is a delight to the eye SHIRLEY JACKSON CASE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO

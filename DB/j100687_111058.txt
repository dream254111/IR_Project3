1  Observations on the Freezing of the Albumen of Eggs By James Paget Esq Professor of Anatomy and Surgery to the Royal College of Surgeons Communicated by Thomas Bell Esq Sec RS c The object of this paper is to illustrate a peculiar property of the albumen of the eggs of birds a property which seems to have its pur pose in preserving them from the injurious effects of very low tem peratures Mr Hunter observed that a fresh egg will resist freezing longer than one which has been previously frozen and thawed and he re ferred this fact to the vital power of the egg in the first case and the destruction of that power by freezing in the second The authors experiments confirm those of Mr Hunter and prove also that when fresh eggs are exposed to very low temperatures and also in the case of eggs which are decayed or putrid or the contents of which have been much altered by mechanical force or by electricity a shorter time is sufficient for the freezing of such eggs than is necessary for the freezing of those which are uninjured An examination of the rates at which heat was lost by the several eggs exposed to temperatures varying from zero to 10 Fahr showed that fresh eggs though they resist freezing longer than any others yet lose heat more quickly and that their resistance to freezing is due to the peculiar property of their albumen the temiperature of which may be reduced to 16 Fahr or much lower without freezing although its proper freezingpoint is at or just below 32 Other than fresh eggs lose heat comparatively slowly but freeze as soon as their temperature is reduced to 32 fresh eggs lose heat more quickly but may be reduced to 16 or lower then at the instant of beginning to freeze their temperature rises to 32 That this peculiarity of fresh eggs is not due to vital properties is proved by experiments which show that certain injuries such as mechanical violence addition of water and others which spoil their powers of resisting freezing do not prevent eggs from being deve loped in incubation By the same and other experiments which are related it is made probable that the peculiarity depends on the me chanical properties of the albumien for whatever makes the albumen more liquid than it is naturally in the fresh egg destroys the power of resisting freezing907 The author could find no other substance possessing this property and in evidence of its adaptation to the purpose of preserving eggs from the loss of their capacity of developement which they would suffer in being frozen he relates experiments in which eggs were kept for a considerable time at temperatures ranging from zero to 10 Fahr yet were afterwards developed in incubation By the same series of experiments it was shown that although freezing renders the effectual developement of the germ impossible yet the intensest cold if freezing does not take place has no similar result 2 A Letter from M Kupffer to LieutCol Sabine For Sec RS On the establishment of a Central Physical Observatory at St Petersburg Communicated by LieutCol Sabine Observatoire Physique Central St Petersbourg ce 21 Juillet 2 Aout 1849 Monsieur et cher amiJe suis heureux le pouvoir vous annoncer que lobservatoire physique central donti le projet a 6te confirme par S M lEmpereur il y a deuxans est achev6 et son activite a com mence des le 1er Juillet Cet 6tablissement est destine comme jai deja eu le plaisir de vous 6crire il y a longtemps a former un point central pour nos observa toires magn6tiques et meteorologiques et en general pour tout ce qui se fait dans l6tendue de lEmpire de Russie pour la mn6torologie et le magnietisme terrestre il y a un emnplacement suffisalmment grand pour contenir plusieurs salles dobservation pour loger le directeur et son secretaire et plusieurs calculateurs pour une bibliotheque et larchive des observations magnetiques et mneteorologiques envoyees de differens points de lEmpire Le directeur de lobservatoire phy sique central exerce lune surveillance active sur toutes les stations magnetiques et m6teorologiques de lEmpire il fait de temps en temps des voyages dinspection les observateurs quon emploie dans ces stations reSoivent leurs instructions de lobservatoire de phy sique les instrumens quon leur fournit sent verifies et compares aux instrumens de lobservatoire des instrumens 6galement verifies et compar6s sont delivres a tous les physiciens faisant partie dex peditions ordonnes par le gouvernement toutes les observations magnetiques et meteorologiques quon fait clans lFtendue de lEmpire sont adressees au directeur de lobservatoire appreciees calculees et imprimees par ses soins on essaie a lobservatoire central toutes les nouvelles methodes dobservation avant de les mettre en pratique on sy occupe de leur perfectionnement enfin on y trouve reunis tous les moyens necessaires pour faire des recherches dans toutes les branches de la physique qui sont dans un rapport plus ou moins direct avec la physique de la terre et qui exigent une exactitude difficile ou impossible a atteindre dans les cabinets de physique ordinaireso Maintenant je nai quun seul voeu B former cest que lexemple de notre gouvernement soit bient6t suivi par le gouvernement anglais qui a deja fait de si grands sacrifices pour le magnetisme terrestre Une longue expferience a du vous apprendre comme elle me a appris quun tel etablissement est une necessit6 lorsquor

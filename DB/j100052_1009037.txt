J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1009037,THE SUBJECTIVE AND THE OBJECTIVE VIEW OF DISTRIBUTION,I242487,THE SUBJECTIVE AND THE OBJECTIVE VIEW OF DISTRIBUTION IT IS MY OBJECT IN THIS PAPER TO SHOW THE WIDE DIVERGENCE WHICH THE THEORY OF DISTRIBUTION PRESENTS ACCORDING AS WE REGARD IT TO DEAL WITH OBJECTIVE OR WITH SUBJECTIVE COSTS AND  UTILITIES AND TO INDICATE THE NATURE OF THE CONNECTION WHICH EXISTS BETWEEN THE OBJECTIVE AND THE SUBJECTIVE DIVI DEND OR SURPLUS BY OBJECTIVE COST HERE IS MEANT THE AMOUNT OF PRO DUCTIVE ENERGY WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR THE MAKING OF A PIECE OF WEALTH MEASURED BY FOOTTONS HOURS OF LABOR OR SOME OTHER OBJECTIVE SOCIAL STANDARD AND INVOLVING NO CONSIDERATION OF THE DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF PAINFUL EFFORT REQUIRED FOR THE GIVEN OUTPUTS OF ENERGY ACCORDING AS THIS MAN OR THAT MAN IS REQUIRED TO DO THE WORK BY OBJECTIVE UTILITY IS MEANT THE TOTAL ADVANTAGE ATTACHING TO THE POSSESSION AND USE OF A COMMODITY REGARDED AS A QUALITY INHERENT IN THIS COMMODITY AND CONSIDERED FROM THE SOCIAL AS DISTINCT FROM THE INDI VIDUAL CONSUMERS STANDPOINT THE LIFESUSTAINING AND PLEASURABLE PROPERTIES OF A COAT A LOAF A PIANO ESTIMATED

WITH THE QUANTITY OF PAIN INVOLVED IN OBTAINING A GIVEN QUANTITY OF OBJECTIVE COST OR PRODUCTIVE ENERGY AND THE QUANTITY OF PLEASURE DERIVED FROM CONSUM ING A GIVEN QUANTITY OF OBJECTIVE UTILITIES THE OBJECTIVE SETTING OF THE PROBLEM OF DISTRIBUTION HAS NOTHING TO DO THE OBJECTIVE SETTING WILL TAKE THE FOLLOWING SHAPE A NUMBER OF UNITS OF OBJECTIVE COST PRODUCTIVE FORCE CONSIST ING OF  SINCE THE WORD INHERENT MAY MISLEAD AS IMPLYING AN ABSOLUTENESS OR PER MANENCY WHICH IS NOT IN ACCORD WITH FACT I MAY BE TAKEN TO FOLLOW JEVONS IN REGARDING IT AS  A CIRCUMSTANCE OF THINGS ARISING OUT OF THEIR

PERSONS WHO EXERT THE FORCES X Y Z IN ORDER TO INDUCE A CONTINUANCE OF THESE NECESSARY EFFORTS THE PROPORTION OF THE DIVIDEND WHICH GOES IN THESE CHARGES AND THE DETERMINATION OF EACH CHARGE ARE GOVERNED DIRECTLY BY CONSIDERATIONS OF SUBJECTIVE COSTTHAT IS BY THE AMOUNT OF PAINFUL EFFORT WHICH MUST BE SUFFERED IN ORDER TO SECURE THE REQUISITE QUANTITY OF UNITS OF EACH KIND OF OBJECTIVE COST IN ORDER AT ANY TIME IN ANY SOCIETY TO INDUCE INDIVIDUALS TO UNDERGO THE NECESSARY AMOUNTS OF PAINFUL EFFORTS A CERTAIN PROPORTION OF THE AGGREGATE OF OBJECTIVE UTILITIES MUST BE ALLOTTED TO THEM ALTHOUGH AT DIFFERENT TIMES AND IN DIFFERENT SOCIAL CONDITIONS DIFFERENT QUANTITIES OF OBJECTIVE UTILITIES WILL BE REQUIRED TO EVOKE THE SAME AMOUNTS OF INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTIVE EFFORT IN RELATION TO THE CONSIDERATION OF A PARTICULAR DIVIDEND THESE MAY BE REGARDED AS FIXED CHARGES IT IS HOWEVER NECESSARY TO CLEARLY SIGNIFY WHAT SERVICES FORM THE BASIS OF CLAIMS TO THESE CHARGES IN ORDER TO REALIZE 379 4344 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY THE AMOUNT AND CHARACTER OF THE OBJECTIVE DIVIDEND WHICH REMAINS FOR DISTRIBUTION BY OTHER LAWS BY A MINIMUM WAGE I MEAN THE LOWEST REAL WAGE NECES SARY TO EVOKE THE EFFORT OF THE MARGINAL LABORER IN EACH CLASS OF LABOR THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY AS PROFESSOR MARSHALL SEEMS TO THINK THE EXACT EQUIVALENT OF A MARGINAL LABORERS PRODUCT IT MAY BE LESS AS WILL BE THE CASE WHERE THERE EXISTS ANY UNEMPLOYED COMPETITORS FOR ANY GRADES OF WORK ABOVE THE LOWEST IT CANNOT BE MORE ASSUMING AN ECONOM ICAL APPLICATION OF CAPITAL REGARDING LABORERS AS DIVIDED INTO A NUMBER OF NON COMPETING GROUPS WE HAVE A NUMBER OF THESE MINIMA FOR DIFFERENT CLASSES OF WORK WHERE PAYMENT IS BY TIME WAGE PURE AND SIMPLE THE SUPERIOR ABILITY OF A LABORER WITHIN HIS CLASS IS NOT REPRE SENTED IN WAGES BUT WHERE PIECE WAGES IN ANY FORM PRE VAIL A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL RENTS OF ABILITY EMERGE FROM EACH SPECIFIC WAGE LEVEL THE SAME GRADATION APPLIES TO VARIOUS KINDS AND DEGREES OF MENTAL PRODUCTIVE EFFORTS WE HAVE MINIMUM EARNINGS OF MANAGEMENT IN SEVERAL CLASSES OF BRAIN LABOR AND ALSO INDIVIDUAL RENTS MEASURING DIFFERENT DEGREES OF ABILITY WITH IN THE CLASS IF THERE EXISTED IN A COMMUNITY ABSOLUTE EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY IN THE SELECTION OF KINDS OF WORK AND THE ACQUI SITION OF KINDS OF SKILL THAT IS TO SAY IF THERE WERE ABSOLUTE FLUIDITY OF LABOR ALL SPECIFIC RENTS WOULD DISAPPEAR INDIVID UAL RENTS ALONE REMAINING THE FORMER ARE DETERMINED BY THE DEGREE OF MONOPOLY OR ABSENCE OF FREE COMPETITION ATTACHING TO THE SEVERAL CLASSES OF WORK SUPPLY OF LABOR THUS LIMITED COMMANDS A HIGHER PRICE IF WE COMPARE AN HOURS LABOR OF A PHYSICIAN WITH THAT OF A PORTER WE FIND THE FORMER IS MORE HIGHLY PAID BECAUSE EVEN ASSUMING FREE COMPETITION AMONG EXISTING PHYSICIANS THE SUPPLY OF PHYSI CIANS OFFERING THEIR SERVICES AT THE WAGE OF THE MOST EFFICIENT PORTER WOULD BE GREATLY BELOW THE DEMAND AT THAT PRICE 380VIEWS OF DISTRIBUTION THAT IS TO SAY UNDER EXISTING CONDITIONS SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR PHYSICIANS WORK WOULD EQUATE AT A MUCH HIGHER MARK THAN FOR PORTERS WORK IT IS THIS MONOPOLY POWER IN ITS VARIOUS DEGREES THAT GIVES RISE TO A NUMBER OF SPECIFIC RENTS OF LABOR OR CLASS WAGES THEY ARE CORRECTLY TO BE REGARDED AS DETERMINED NOT BY THE HIGHER ESTIMATE SET BY SOCIETY UPON A PARTICULAR KIND OF WORK FOR A BAKERS IS ABSOLUTELY MORE NECESSARY THAN A LAWYERS BUT BY CAUSES AFFECTING THE SUPPLY OF LABOR AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM OF TECHNI CAL EDUCATION TOGETHER WITH A REMOVAL OF OTHER BARRIERS WHICH IGNORANCE POVERTY SOCIAL PREJUDICE ETC IMPOSE ON FREE ENTRANCE INTO THE SEVERAL TRADES AND PROFESSIONS WOULD BY PRACTICALLY SECURING FLUIDITY OF LABOR ABOLISH SPECIFIC RENTS OF LABOR WHILE INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES OF WAGE ARE NECESSARY CHARGES ON THE OBJECTIVE DIVIDEND SPECIFIC RENTS OF LABOR ARE NOT THE NEXT CHARGE UPON THE OBJECTIVE DIVIDEND IS A NUMBER OF MINIMUM INTERESTS OF CAPITAL IN VARIOUS CLASSES OF INVEST MENT IF CAPITAL WERE ABSOLUTELY FLUID AND COMPETITION IN INVESTMENTS FREE THERE WOULD BE ONLY ONE RATE OF INTEREST NAMELY THAT NECESSARY TO EVOLVE THE MARGINAL ACT OF SAVING THE LAST SAVING REQUIRED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE FUND OF CAPITAL SOCIALLY NECESSARY TO ASSIST IN PRODUCING WHAT WAS REQUIRED TO KEEP PACE WITH CURRENT CONSUMPTION BUT CAPITAL MAY BE GRADED SIMILARLY WITH LABOR IN REGARD TO THE REMUNERATIVENESS OF ITS SEVERAL KINDS OF EMPLOYMENT ELIMINATING ALL ELEMENTS OF RISK SKILL OF MANAGEMENT ETC IT WOULD BE EVIDENT THAT STATE OR MUNICIPAL PRIVILEGE OR MONOPOLY TRADE SECRETS MONOPOLIES ARISING FROM THE POSSES SION OF LAND CLASS OPPORTUNITY AND LARGE SCALE OF PRODUCTION ENABLING THE NARROWING OF COMPETITION IN VARIOUS SHAPES AND DEGREES ESTABLISHES CLASS DIFFERENCES OF INVESTMENT WHICH RE SEMBLE THE SPECIFIC GRADES OF LABOR HENCE AS IN LABOR SO IN CAPITAL THERE ARE SPECIFIC AND INDIVIDUAL LEVELS OF REMUNERATION THE Y UNITS OF PRODUCTIVE FORCE IN SAVING ARE RECKONED IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL AND MENTAL EFFORT OF THE SAVERS 381 4546 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY THE MARGINAL ACT OF SAVING IS RELATED TO THE MINIMUM INTEREST AS THE MARGINAL LABORERS EFFORT IS RELATED TO THE MINIMUM CLASS WAGE WITH THIS SINGLE DIFFERENCE THAT WHEREAS THE MARGINAL LABORERS WAGE THOUGH NOT EXCEEDING HIS PRODUCT MAY BE MORE THAN SUFFICIENT TO EVOKE HIS EFFORT SUPPOSING NO UNEMPLOYED LABORERS IN HIS CLASS THE MARGINAL INTEREST WILL NOT BE MORE THAN ENOUGH TO EVOKE THE MARGINAL EFFORT OF SAVING UNLESS WE SUPPOSE THE EXTREME CASE OF A SOCIETY WITH A SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CLEAVAGE SO DISTINCT AS TO CONFINE THE POSSIBILITY OF SAVING TO A FEW WHILE THE MANY ARE KEPT CLOSELY DOWN TO A BARE SUBSISTENCE WAGE THE EFFORT OF SAVING I AM DISPOSED TO URGE IS PRODUCTIVE OF WEALTH JUST AS IS ANY OTHER EFFORT AND IS NOT TO BE REGARDED AS EITHER A NEGATIVE FORCE OF PRODUCTION OR AS A CONDITION OF THE EFFECTIVE APPLICATION OF LABOR IN ORDER TO RECOGNIZE THIS TRUTH WE MUST BEAR IN MIND THAT IT IS NOT THE PRELIMI NARY ACT OF PRODUCING SOMETHING NOT DESTINED FOR IMMEDIATE CONSUMPTION THAT CONSTITUTES THE PRODUCTIVE EFFORT OF SAVING BUT THE CONTINUOUS RESTRAINT OF THE DESIRE OF PERSONAL ENJOY MENT OF ONES PROPERTY THIS EFFORT I THINK MAY BE RIGHTLY REGARDED AS THE EFFICIENT CAUSE OF THE FRUCTIFICATION OF FUTURE GOODS INTO PRESENT GOODS WHICH SOME ECONOMISTS OF THE AUSTRIAN SCHOOL APPEAR TO THINK INCONSISTENT WITH A PRODUCTIVITY THEORY OF INTEREST THIS ATTRIBUTION OF ANTAGONISM BETWEEN THE PRODUCTIVITY AND THE TIME THEORY OF INTEREST IS I BELIEVE BASED ON THE SAME MISAPPRE HENSION WHICH HAS ALWAYS DENOUNCED THE PRODUCTIVITY THEORY ON THE GROUND OF THE NEGATIVE CHARACTER OF THE EFFORT OF ABSTINENCE THERE IS NO BASIS FOR THIS DISTINCTION OF POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EFFORT THE FORCE EXERTED IN THE SHAPE OF CONTINUOUS SELFRESTRAINT OF AN OWNER OF CAPITAL IS THE FORCE WHICH ENABLES THE FUTURE GOODS TO PASS INTO PRESENT GOODS IT IS AN EFFORT AS TRULY PRODUCTIVE AS THE EFFORT WHICH LIFTS SO MANY FOOTTONS HENCE THE MINIMUM INTEREST WILL BE A FIXED CHARGE UPON THE OBJECTIVE DIVIDEND BECAUSE IT IS REQUIRED TO EVOKE THE 382VIEWS OF DISTRIBUTION SUBJECTIVE COST OR PAINFUL EXERTION WHICH FURNISHES ONE KIND OF PRODUCTIVE FORCE OR OBJECTIVE COST SINCE IT IS ESSENTIAL TO THE ACCEPTANCE OF THIS ANALYSIS THAT ABSTINENCE AND OTHER FORMS OF SERVICEABLE  SACRIFICE  SHALL BE INCLUDED AS SUBJECTIVE COSTS  FORMING THE BASIS OF CLAIMS UPON THE OBJECTIVE DIVIDEND I MUST HERE TURN ASIDE TO DEAL WITH PROFESSOR PATTENS OBJECTION TO SUCH INCLUSIONS HE OBJECTS TO RANK THE EFFORT OF ABSTINENCE INVOLVED IN SAVING UNDER SUBJECTIVE  COST ON THE GROUND THAT THE THRIFTY MAN  HAS A SURPLUS OF PLEASURE IN SUPPLYING FUTURE WANTS INSTEAD OF A SURPLUS OF PAIN OR TO ADOPT HERBERT SPENCERS TERM THE MANS MIND IS SO POWERFULLY  REREPRESENTATIVE  THAT HE REAPS A NET SATISFACTION FROM HIS ACT OF ABSTINENCE BUT SURELY IF THIS IS A REASON FOR EXCLUDING ABSTINENCE FROM SUBJECTIVE  COST THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS  COST AT ALL FOR THE SAME ARGUMENT WILL EXCLUDE EVERY FORM OF EXERTION EVERY VOL UNTARY EXERTION IS ATTENDED BY A SATISFACTION OR SUBJECTIVE UTILITY THE CONSIDERATION OF WHICH AS A PRESENT MOTIVE MUST OUTWEIGH THE PRESENT PAIN OF THE EXERTION FOR OTHERWISE NO ACTION WOULD BE DONE EVERY FREE CONSCIOUS ACTION IS MOTIVED BY A DESIRE TO OBTAIN THE NET BALANCE OF SATISFACTION WHICH THE IMAGINATION PRESENTS AS THE RESULTANT FROM THE CON FLICT OF PLEASURES AND PAINS WHICH ATTEND THE PERFORMANCE OF THE ACTION IF INSTEAD OF APPLYING THE TERM  COSTS  TO THE PAINS AS THEY OCCUR AND  UTILITIES TO THE PLEASURES AS THEY ISSUE WE CONSIDER ONLY THE RESULTANT THEN NO USE REMAINS FOR THE TERM  COSTS  AT ALL SAVE IN THE CASE OF A MISCALCU LATED ACTION FOR THE RESULTANT OF A REASONABLY ORDERED ACTION WILL ALWAYS APPEAR IN TERMS OF PLEASURE OR SUBJECTIVE UTILITY THIS CONFUSION OF PROFESSOR PATTENS ARGUMENT APPEARS MORE MANIFEST IN HIS ILLUSTRATION OF THE OPERATION OF HUNGER  HUNGER ADDS TO THE PLEASURE OF THE MEAL MORE THAN IT TAKES AWAY FROM IT    CAN WE AT THE SAME TIME SAY HUNGER IS THE BEST SAUCE AND ALSO CALL IT A PAIN  THE SENSATION MAY CONTINUE DISAGREEABLE BUT WE ENJOY THE FEELING IT CREATES IN  COST AND UTILITY ANNALS VOL III P 414 JANUARY I893 383 4748 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY COMPUTING THE SURPLUS OF A MEAL WE SHOULD THEREFORE RECKON THE ANTICIPATED FEELINGS WHICH HUNGER PRODUCES AND THE RESULT ING ADVANTAGES AS A NET GAIN RATHER THAN AN UNCOMPENSATED LOSS  HERE THE ACTUAL PAIN OF HUNGER IS CONFUSED WITH THE PLEASURE ATTENDING THE IMAGINATION OF ITS RELIEF THE PAIN IS NO DOUBT A NECESSARY CONDITION OF THE ATTAINMENT OF THE PLEASURE AND IN CERTAIN CASES THE PLEASURE MAY EVEN OUTWEIGH THE PAIN BUT THE FEELING OF HUNGER IS A PAIN FOR ALL THAT AND MUST RANK AS A SUBJECTIVE COST THE LABOR OF PREPARING THE MEAL TO A HUNGRY MAN MAY BE A PROCESS ATTENDED BY A LARGE SURPLUS OF PLEASURE IN THE WAY OF ANTICIPATION BUT SINCE EVERY LABOR IS UNDERTAKEN UNDER THE PRESSURE OF A SIMILAR MOTIVE THE RECKONING OF SUBJECTIVE  COST DISAPPEARS ALTOGETHER IF WE LOOK ONLY TO THE NET RESULTANT SO LONG AS WE MAINTAIN THE ANTITHETICAL TERMS COST AND UTILITY WE MUST COUNT UNDER THE FORMER ALL FORMS OF SELFASSERTION OR SELFRESTRAINT WHICH OF THEMSELVES AND IN THEIR DIRECT EFFECTS INVOLVE PAIN THE DIFFICULTY CONNECTED WITH THE INCLUSION OF SAVING UNDER PAINFUL EFFORT IS LARGELY DUE TO THE SELECTION OF THE TERM  ABSTINENCE WHICH AS A NEGATIVE EXPRESSION FURNISHES NO CONTENTS OF PAINFUL FEELING THE REAL SACRIFICE OF  SAVING ONCE CLEARLY CONCEIVED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE MARGINAL SAVER AS A CONTINUOUS PAINFUL SELFRESTRAINT OBLIGES US TO ADMIT IT AS A PAIN COMMENSURABLE WITH OTHER PAINFUL EFFORTS OF PRODUCTION I WOULD DEAL IN THE SAME WAY WITH OTHER  SACRIFICES WHERE ANY CHANGE IN METHODS OF PRODUCTION REQUIRES THE ABANDONMENT OF ANY ADVANTAGE PREVIOUSLY ENJOYED SUCH SACRIFICE MUST RECKON AS A COST IN GOING FROM THE COUNTRY TO THE CITY THE WORKMAN GIVES UP PURE AIR FOR BETTER AMUSEMENTS THE EMIGRANT MUST CHANGE HIS DIET AND WHOEVER ACQUIRES REGULAR HABITS OF INDUSTRY GIVES UP A LARGE PART OF THE FREE GOODS HE MIGHT ENJOYHUNTING FISHING ETC T PRO FESSOR PATTEN REFUSES TO COUNT ANY OF THESE SACRIFICES AS  IBID P 415 LIBID P 412 384VIEWS OF DISTRIBUTION COSTS BECAUSE THE CHANGE IS SUPPOSED TO BE ATTENDED BY A NET SURPLUS OF GAIN I SHOULD INSIST THAT THE ABANDONMENT OF THE GOOD AIR AND OTHER ADVANTAGES ONCE ENJOYED SHOULD BE RECKONED UNDER COSTS IT MIGHT HOWEVER BE FAIRLY URGED THAT A DISTINCTION SHOULD BE MADE BETWEEN THE SACRIFICE OF GOOD AIR WHICH IS ASSUREDLY A  PAIN AND THE CHANGE FROM ONE FORM OF DIET SUITED TO COUNTRY LIFE TO ANOTHER FORM SUITED TO CITY LIFE HAVING ALREADY RECKONED THE LOSS OF GOOD AIR AND OTHER PHYSICAL DISADVANTAGES AS PAINS AND COSTS IT MAY BE PLAUSIBLY ARGUED THAT THE CHANGE OF DIET IS NOT A COST I E THERE IS NO  SACRIFICE  IN ABANDONING AN OLD DIET THE USE OF WHICH HAS NOW LARGELY PASSED AWAY AS TO THE OTHER CLASS OF SACRIFICES INVOLVED IN ANY ACCEPTANCE OF ALTERNA TIVE COURSES OF ACTION THEY MAY FAIRLY BE EXCLUDED FROM COSTS IF A LABORER CAN OBTAIN A SURPLUS BY MAKING SHOES OR HATS HE MUST SACRIFICE ONE OF THESE SURPLUSES TO OBTAIN THE OTHER SUCH SACRIFICE I SHOULD NOT COUNT A COST FOR A CHOICE OF ALTERNATIVES DOES NOT INVOLVE ANY NEW PAIN OR THE LOSS OF ANY OLD PLEASURE THE LOSS OF A SETTLED HOME RESULT ING FROM THE EXTENSIVE MOVEMENT OF WORKMEN FROM ONE COUNTRY TO ANOTHER AND FROM COUNTRY TO TOWN MUST HOWEVER BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE SACRIFICES JUST MENTIONED IT INVOLVES IN ITSELF A LOSS OF PLEASURE WHICH MUST BE RECKONED A SUBJECTIVE COST THE SAME LINE OF ARGUMENT MUST APPLY TO THAT  SACRIFICE WHICH PROFESSOR PATTEN SEVERS MOST DISTINCTLY FROM OTHER COSTS THE DAMAGE INFLICTED UPON CONSUMPTION BY AN EXTEN SION OF THE WORKING DAY WHEN THE COST OF SUCH AN EXTENSION IS BEING RECKONED TO THE PAIN OF THE INCREASED PHYSICAL OR MEN TAL EXERTION MUST BE ADDED THE PAIN REPRESENTED BY DAMAGED CONSUMPTION BOTH THESE PAINS WILL BE  POOLED  AS A SINGLE MOTIVE IN THE MIND OF THE WORKER WHO IS CONSIDERING WHETHER OR NOT HE SHALL EXTEND HIS WORKING DAY THE EXPENSE IN MONEY OF INDUCING HIM TO EXTEND HIS WORKING DAY MUST COVER BOTH KINDS OF PAIN BOTH PAINS MUST THEREFORE BE REGARDED AS THE IBID P 412 385 4950 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY SUBJECTIVE BASIS OF OBJECTIVE COSTS FOR CERTAIN PURPOSES IT IS CONVENIENT TO DISTINGUISH THIS SACRIFICE IMPRESSED UPON CONSUMPTION FROM OTHER  COSTS MORE DIRECTLY LINKED WITH THE ENERGY GIVEN OUT IN PRODUCTION FOR EXAMPLE IN CON SIDERING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE EIGHTHOURDAY MOVEMENT IT IS USEFUL TO GIVE SEPARATE ATTENTION TO THE ADVANTAGE WHICH A SHORTER WORKING DAY WILL CONFER BY REASON OF ITS EFFECT UPON CONSUMPTION BUT SINCE AS PROFESSOR PATTEN ADMITS THIS SACRI FICE IS  MEASURED IN TERMS OF COST IT WILL BE SURELY MOST CONVENIENT TO INCLUDE IT ALWAYS UNDER THE GENERIC TITLE  COST RESERVING THE RIGHT TO TREAT IT AS A SPECIES DISTINGUISH ABLE FROM THE OTHER AND MORE DIRECT EFFORTS OF PRODUCTION WHEN IT MAY SEEM GOOD IN THE MAIN SCHEME OF PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION I HOLD IT NECESSARY TO INCLUDE THIS SACRIFICE UNDER COSTS WHERE PROFESSOR PATTEN DISTINGUISHES THE TWO BY URGING THAT COSTS  FORM A BARRIER BELOW WHICH THE RETURN OF THE PRODUCER CANNOT FALL THUS FIXING THE LIMIT TO THE CHANGES IN OBJECTIVE VALUES THROUGH WHICH THE DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH IS EFFECTED SACRIFICES HOWEVER DEPEND NOT ON AN ACT OF PRODUCTION BUT ON HAVING CERTAIN GOODS TO ENJOY WHICH MUST BE GIVEN UP TO EXTEND PRODUCTION  I SHOULD INSIST UPON INCLUDING SACRIFICE UNDER THE  COSTS  OR  PAINS  WHICH FIX THE MINIMUM RETURN IN OBJECTIVE VALUES MOREOVER SINCE EVERY ACT OF PRODUCTION IS AN ACT OCCUPYING TIME AND ABSORBING A PORTION OF VITAL ENERGY I SHOULD NOT ASSENT TO THE DEFINITE DIVORCEMENT OF SACRIFICE FROM ACTS OF PRODUCTION  EVERY ACT OF PRODUCTION INVOKES A SACRIFICE OF CONSUMING TIME AND CONSUMING ENERGY AND EVERY CHANGE IN METHODS OF PRODUCTION WILL AFFECT THIS TIME AND THIS ENERGY IN CONSIDERING THE CAUSES OF THE INCREASE OR DECREASE OF THIS PARTICULAR SPECIES OF COST IT WILL BE USEFUL TO LOOK MORE CLOSELY AND DIRECTLY AT THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE SURPLUS BUT SINCE THE CHANGES IN DISTRIBUTION OF THE SURPLUS ARE CLOSELY RELATED TO CHANGES IN METHODS OF PRODUCTION PROFESSOR PATTEN DOES NOT SEEM JUSTIFIED IN REGARDING THIS  SACRIFICE AS THE  COST AND EXPENSE  ANNALS VOL III P 709 MAY 1893 386VIEWS OF DISTRIBUTION BASIS OF A SEPARATE FUND DISTRIBUTABLE UNDER A DIFFERENT LAW FROM OTHER SUBJECTIVE VALUES THESE  SACRIFICES WHICH ARE RIGHTLY COUNTED AS COSTS MUST BE REGARDED AS COMMENSURABLE WITH OTHER EFFORTS OF PAINFUL EXERTION IN PRODUCTION IN A GIVEN MAN SO MUCH EFFORT OF PAINFUL SELFRESTRAINT IN  SAVING  SO MUCH DEPRIVA TION OF EARLIER FORMS OF PLEASURABLE CONSUMPTION SO MUCH DIMINUTION IN THE FORMS OF PLEASUREABLE CONSUMPTION WHICH ARE RETAINED WILL FIND THEIR EQUIVALENTS IN SO MANY UNITS OF PHYSICAL OR MENTAL EXERTION ALL ARE FORMS OF SUBJECTIVE  COST AND SO FAR AS THEY ARE SEVERALLY NEEDED FOR THE OUT PUT OF OBJECTIVE COST OR PRODUCTIVE ENERGY THEY HAVE FIXED CLAIMS ON THE OBJECTIVE DIVIDEND THE OBJECTIVE VIEW OF DISTRIBUTION REGARDS THE OBJECTIVE DIVIDEND AS DIVISIBLE INTO TWO PARTS ONE IS COMPOSED OF THE MINIMUM WAGES AND INTERESTS NECESSARY TO EVOKE THE DIFFERENT KINDS AND AMOUNTS OF INDIVIDUAL PAIN WHICH FUR NISHES THE PRODUCTIVE ENERGY OF THE COMMUNITY THE OTHER SECTION IS COMPRISED OF ECONOMIC RENTS INCLUDING A A NUM BER OF SPECIFIC AND INDIVIDUAL RENTS OF LAND SPECIFIC RENTS BEING THE MINIMUM RENT FOR WHEATLAND MARKETGARDENS TOPLANDS ETC WH6SE PRODUCE COMPETES IN THE SAME MARKET INDIVIDUAL RENTS MEASURING THE SUPERIORITY OF AN INDIVID UAL PIECE OF WHEATLAND TOPLAND ETC OVER THE LAND WHICH PAYS THE MINIMUM RENT IN EACH SEVERAL EMPLOYMENT B SPECIFIC AND INDIVIDUAL RENTS OF CAPITAL REPRESENTING THE SPECIAL ADVANTAGES ENJOYED BY PARTICULAR CLASSES OF INVEST MENT AND BY INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS WITHIN EACH CLASS ENABLING THE OWNERS OF CAPITAL TO DRAW INTEREST ABOVE THE MINIMUM ECONOMICALLY NECESSARY TO EVOKE SAVING C SPECIFIC RENTS OF LABOR OR CLASS WAGES AS DISTINGUISHED FROM WAGES WHICH MARK THE SUPERIOR ABILITY OF AN INDIVIDUAL WORKER OVER  THESE NECESSARY WAGES AND INTERESTS COMPRISE THE  EXPENSES  OF PRODUCTION EXPENSES AS COMMONLY USED BY ENGLISH ECONOMISTS INCLUDE VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF MONOPOLY RENT PROFESSOR PATTEN IS PUSHED BY HIS EXCLUSION OF SACRIFICES FROM  COSTS  TO ASSOCIATE EXPENSES WITH  REWARD FOR LABORS  AND NOT WITH  COST BUT IF THE USE OF COST ABOVE ADVOCATED IS ACCEPTED EXPENSE WILL MOST REASONABLY BE USED AS THE MONEY EXPRESSION OF OBJECTIVE COSTS 387 5152 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY THE WORST WORKER EMPLOYED IN HIS CLASS OF WORK THESE ECONOMIC RENTS ARE RADICALLY DISTINCT IN NATURE FROM THE MINIMUM WAGES AND INTERESTS IN THAT THEY FURNISH NO INCEN TIVE TO INDIVIDUAL EXERTION THIS WILL BE READILY ADMITTED OF THE ECONOMIC RENT OF LAND AND THAT INTEREST ABOVE THE MAR GIN WHICH WE TERM RENTS OF CAPITAL NO ATTEMPT TO TAX THESE RENTS WOULD PREVENT THE OWNERS OF THESE REQUISITES OF PRODUCTION FROM USING THEM AS BEFORE EVEN AS REGARDS SPECIFIC RENTS OF LABOR IT IS EQUALLY TRUE IN THE LONG RUN THE LONG CONTINUANCE OF A HIGHCLASS WAGE ESTABLISHES A FIXED STANDARD OF COMFORT HIGHER THAN THAT OF COMMON LABOR AND ANY ATTEMPT TO REDUCE THIS IS STOUTLY RESISTED BUT THE RESIST ANCE IS ONLY FOR A TIMEA PERSISTENT ECONOMIC FORCE CAN BEAR DOWN A CLASS STANDARD OF COMFORT AND CAN EXTRACT FROM THE MEMBERS OF THE CLASS THE SAME EFFORT FOR A LESS REWARD IT IS TRUE THAT THERE ARE ECONOMIC LIMITS TO THIS LEVELING PROCESS A HIGHER STANDARD OF COMFORT MAY BE NECESSARY FOR A SKILLED KIND OF WORK TOO MUCH HOWEVER IS MADE OF THIS POINT BY ECONOMISTS LIKE PROFESSOR MARSHALL WHO THINKS THAT A MAN DOING GOOD INTELLECTUAL WORK REQUIRES A FAMILY INCOME OF SOME 5OO00 OR 6OO PER ANNUM TO MAINTAIN HIS EFFICIENCY MUCH OF THIS EXPENDITURE AS INDEED PROFESSOR MARSHALL AD MITS IS OCCASIONED BY THE DEMANDS OF CUSTOM IT IS PROBABLE ENOUGH THAT THE STANDARD OF COMFORT HABITUAL IN THE LOWEST PAID CLASSES OF LABOR IS BELOW THE TRUE STANDARD OF EFFICIENCY BUT IT IS NOT TRUE THAT A SCHOLAR OR A PROFESSIONAL MAN LIVING HIS LIFE REASONABLY AND NOT REQUIRING A HEAVY HOLIDAY FUND TO CURE TEMPORARY EXCESSES OF LABOR NEEDS A MUCH HIGHER INCOME IF WE WERE TO TAKE THE NATIONAL OBJECTIVE DIVIDEND AND TRACE ITS APPORTIONMENT WE SHOULD FIND THAT IT WENT PARTLY AS REWARDS OR STIMULI OF EFFORT PARTLY AS RENTS TO THOSE ENGAGED IN GIVING OUT INDIVIDUAL EFFORT AND TO OWNERS OF THE FORCES OF NATURE IF WE TOOK THE PRICE OF A SINGLE CONSUMPTION GOOD WE COULD SIMILARLY RESOLVE IT INTO A NUMBER OF PAYMENTS MADE FOR  HERE I ASSUME THE TAXATION TO BE THE COMMON ACT OF A WHOLE INDUSTRIAL COM MUNITY THE ATTEMPT TO TAX CERTAIN RENTS OF CAPITAL IN ENGLAND MIGHT LEAD TO THE TRANSFER OF THIS CAPITAL ABROAD 388VIEWS OF DISTRIBUTION EXPENSES AND RENTS AT THE SEVERAL POINTS IN PRODUCTION IF WE CHOOSE TO REGARD THE COMMUNITYS PRODUCTION AS A SINGLE BUSINESS WE CAN SAY THAT AFTER THE NECESSARY CURRENT EXPENSES ARE DEFRAYED THE REST IS PROFIT THIS PROFIT CONSISTING OF ECONOMIC RENTS FORMS THE OBJECTIVE SURPLUS THE LAW OF WHOSE APPORTIONMENT HAS CAUSED NO LITTLE TROUBLE TO POLITICAL ECONOMY IN THE PAST NOW HOWEVER THAT PART OF THE PAYMENTS RECEIVED AS WAGES AND INTEREST AS WELL AS THE WHOLE ECONOMIC RENT OF LAND IS ACKNOWLEDGED TO BELONG TO THIS SURPLUS THE LAW OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF THIS OBJECTIVE SURPLUS IS MORE CLEARLY AND WIDELY RECOGNIZED THE SURPLUS IS DIVIDED BY THE LAW OF  MONOPOLY  THE AMOUNT WHICH FALLS TO EACH OWNER OF A REQUISITE OF PRODUCTION IS GOVERNED BY THE PRICES WHICH LIMIT THE SUPPLIES OF THE SEVERAL REQUISITES ROUGHLY SPEAKING WHERE ONE OF THE REQUISITES IS SHORT IN SUPPLY RELATIVELY TO THE OTHERS THE OWNERS OF THAT REQUISITE TAKE THE WHOLE SURPLUS THIS IS COMMONLY ADMITTED BUT AS THERE NOWHERE EXISTS ABSOLUTE TRANSFERABILITY OF CAPITAL LABOR OR LAND FROM ONE EMPLOYMENT TO ANOTHER CAPITAL WILL BE RELATIVELY SHORT IN SOME INDUSTRIES OR IN SOME PROCESSES LAND AND LABOR IN OTHERS SO THE ACTUAL SURPLUS WILL BE DIVIDED AT DIFFERENT POINTS OF THE INDUSTRIAL MACHINE AS RENTS OF LAND LABOR OR CAPITAL WITH OUT ATTEMPTING TO DISCUSS THE LAW OF MONOPOLY IN ITS DETAILED BEARING UPON THE DISTRIBUTION OF THIS SURPLUS I MAY CALL ATTENTION TO THE FOLLOWING MAIN FORCES WHICH AFFECT THE POSITION OF THE THREE REQUISITES AS CLAIMANTS OF THE SURPLUS A EVERY INCREASE OR DECREASE OF DEMAND FOR COMMODITIES AFFECTS NOT ONLY THE QUANTITY BUT THE PROPORTION OF DEMAND FOR THE SEVERAL REQUISITES AND MAY THEREFORE TRANSFER THE POSITION OF LIMITING REQUISITE FROM ONE TO ANOTHER B SIMILARLY FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF SUPPLY OR PRODUC TION NEW INVENTIONS AND IMPROVED SKILL ACCESSIBILITY OF NEW SUPPLIES WILL A DIRECTLY AFFECT THE RELATION BETWEEN THE QUANTITY OF SUPPLY OF THE DIFFERENT REQUISITES 389 5354 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY B ENABLE ONE REQUISITE TO SUPERSEDE ANOTHER A WILL ALSO AFFECT B IN SEVERAL IMPORTANT WAYS FOR EX AMPLE AN INCREASE IN DEMAND IS OFTEN THE FORCE ENABLING FORMS OF CAPITAL IN THE SHAPE OF MACHINERY TO TAKE THE PLACE OF LABOR SO AS TO BRING ABOUT A CONDITION IN WHICH CAPITAL MAY BECOME THE LIMITING REQUISITE INSTEAD OF LABOR AS HERE TOFORE THE SURPLUS THUS SUBJECT TO APPORTIONMENT IS ONE SURPLUS THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE WHOLE OF IT FALLS UNDER THE OPERATION OF THE SAME SET OF FORCES IT FALLS TO LANDOWNERS TO CAPITAL ISTS TO LABORERS IN PROPORTION AS THE REQUISITE OF PRODUCTION OWNED BY EACH IS IN SHORT SUPPLY OR IN EXCESS THIS OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS GIVES US NO INFORMATION REGARDING HUMAN WELFARE A GIVEN QUANTITY OF OBJECTIVE COSTS MAY OBVIOUSLY BE RELATED TO ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT QUANTITIES OF PAIN ACCORDING AS THEY ARE DIFFERENTLY DISTRIBUTED AMONG PRODUCERS WHILE A GIVEN QUANTITY OF OBJECTIVE UTILITIES MAY BE SIMILARLY RELATED TO ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT QUANTITIES OF PLEASURE ACCORDING AS THEY FALL TO DIFFERENT CONSUMERS IN DIFFERENT PROPORTIONS OBJECTIVE COSTS AND UTILITIES MUST BE REDUCED TO TERMS OF SUB JECTIVITY AND THE RELATION BETWEEN THE LAW OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE OBJECTIVE SURPLUS AND OF THE SUBJECTIVE SURPLUS CLEARLY FORMULATED BEFORE WE CAN HAVE A SCIENCE OF POLITICAL ECONOMY BEARING ANY ASSIGNABLE REFERENCE TO HUMAN HAPPINESS UNTIL THIS IS DONE WE HAVE IDEAS OF WEALTH AND WORK WHICH HAVE NO HUMAN SIGNIFICANCE WE HAVE A STUDY AS FAR REMOVED FROM ANY PRACTICAL INTEREST AS GEOMETRY OF THE FOURTH DIMENSION SUCH A POLITICAL ECONOMY CAN HAVE NO ART ATTACHED TO IT THE PURELY OBJECTIVE TREATLMENT OF POLITICAL ECONOMISTS HAS BEEN IN FACT RESPONSIBLE FOR NEARLY ALL THE CLUMSY ERRORS WHICH ITS EXPONENTS HAVE MADE WLEN INVITED TO DISPLAY THEIR ART IN ADVICE OR PROPHECY UNTIL THE SCIENCE IS THUS SUBJECTIVISED IT CAN BE BROUGHT INTO NO TRUE RELATIONS EITHER WITH ETHICS OR POLITICS AND IS NOT PROPERLY A BRANCH OF SOCIOLOGY AT  FOR A FURTHER ACCOUNT OF THE INTRICATE INTERACTION OF THESE FORCES SEE  THE LAW OF THE THREE RENTS QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS 1891 390VIEWS OF DISTRIBUTION ALL BUT WHAT RUSKIN CALLED IT A BRANCH OF MENTAL GYM NASTICS IN ORDER TO GET AT THE CONCEPTION OF THE SUBJECTIVE DIVI DEND AND THE SUBJECTIVE SURPLUS WE WILL BEGIN BY A COM PARISON OF THE WORKING DAY VIEWED OBJECTIVELY AND THE SAME WORKING DAY VIEWED SUBJECTIVELY TAKING THE SIMPLEST CASE WHERE EACH UNIT OF OBJECTIVE COST IS PRODUCTIVE OF THE SAME AMOUNT OF OBJECTIVE UTILITY WE SHALL GET THE FOLLOWING SETTING HOUR COST UTILITY IST    6   YIELDS 9 2D   8   12 3D    6   9 4TH   4    6 SINCE THERE IS HERE NO REFERENCE TO THE PERSONAL BALANCE OF PLEASURE OR PAIN IN THE WORKER BUT ONLY TO OBJECTIVE EXPRES SIONS OF PLEASURE AND PAIN SOCIALLY MEASURED THERE CAN BE NO NECESSITY FOR THE FOURTH OR LAST HOUR OF LABOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL WORKER TO PRESENT AN EQUAL BALANCE OF COST AND UTILITY NOW IF THIS OBJECTIVE SETTING COULD BE TRANSLATED ITEM BY ITEM INTO SUBJECTIVE TERMS IT MIGHT WORK OUT AS FOLLOWS HOUR PAIN SATISFACTION IST    O   YIELDS IO 2D     8 3D   6 3DI    3    6 4TH   4  4 THIS INDEED IS THE COMMON PRESENTATION OF THE SUBJECT AS A BALANCE OF PLEASURE AND PAIN IN THE ORDINARY ECONOMIC TEXT BOOKS IN THE CASE OF A MAN WORKING UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS HIS WORK IT IS ALLEGED WILL BE TERMINATED AT THE FOURTH HOUR BECAUSE THERE IS A BALANCE OF PAIN AND SATISFACTION DERIVED FROM THE ACTIVITY OF THAT HOUR THIS CONCLUSION IS OBVIOUSLY BASED UPON THE SUPPOSITION THAT WE CAN TREAT EACH HOUR SEPA RATELY IN REFERENCE TO THE BALANCE OF PLEASURE AND PAIN 39I 5556 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY NOW PROFESSOR PATTEN HAS CLEARLY SHOWN THAT IN AN ATTEMPT TO COMPUTE THE WORKING DAY HOUR BY HOUR THE LAST HOUR WILL NOT PRESENT AN EXACT BALANCE OF PAIN AND SATISFACTION BUT WILL YIELD A SURPLUS OF SATISFACTION FOR OTHERWISE THE TIME OF PRODUCTION WILL SO ENCROACH UPON THE TIME OF CONSUMPTION THAT THE FULL SUBJECTIVE UTILITY WILL NOT BE GOT OUT OF THE OBJECTIVE UTILITIES CREATED IN THE EARLIER HOURS IF PRODUC TION WERE CARRIED TO THE POINT WHERE THE FINAL INCREMENT OF EFFORT TAKEN ALONE WERE JUST REPAID BY THE FINAL INCREMENT OF UTILITY THE EARLIER UTILITIES WOULD HAVE BEEN FOUND TO HAVE SHRUNK AND THE CONSIDERATION OF THIS SHRINKAGE WILL CHECK PRODUCTION BEFORE THIS POINT IN A DYNAMIC SOCIETY ACCORD ING TO PROFESSOR PATTENS TREATMENT THE FOURTH OR LAST WORKING HOUR WILL NOT BE FOUR UNITS OF PAIN YIELDING FOUR UNITS OF SATISFACTION BUT RATHER FOUR UNITS OF PAIN YIELDING FIVE UNITS OF SATISFACTION NOW UPON THIS CONSIDERATION I UNDERSTAND PROFESSOR PATTEN TO BASE HIS DISCOVERY OF A SURPLUS DISTINCT AND SEPARATE FROM THE REST OF SURPLUS REVENUE AND SUBJECT TO A SPECIAL LAW OF DISTRIBUTION  IF THERE IS A SURPLUS IN THE LAST INCREMENT OF A NORMAL DAYS LABOR THE THEORY OF DISTRIBU TION WILL BE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT IT WILL BE IF THERE IS NO SUCH SURPLUS IN THE LATTER CASE THE WHOLE DISTRIBUTION DEPENDS UPON THE COST OF THE MARGINAL INCREMENT OF PRODUCTION THE LAW OF DIFFERENTIAL COST OR RENT WILL THEN DETERMINE THE DISTRI BUTION OF THE SURPLUS BUT IF THERE IS A SURPLUS AT THE MARGIN OF PRODUCTION A PART OF THE SURPLUS IS DISTRIBUTED NOT BY A LAW OF COST BUT BY THE LAW OF MONOPOLY THE MOST SLOWLY INCREASING FACTORS OF PRODUCTION BECOME MONOPOLIES AND SECURE THE GREATER PART OF THE SURPLUS PRODUCERS WHO HAVE THE POWER OF RAISING THE OBJECTIVE VALUE OF THEIR COMMO DITIES DO SO AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHER PRODUCERS AND NOT OF CONSUMERS  NOW IF MY STATEMENT OF THE QUESTION OF DISTRIBUTION IS CORRECT RENTS CAN IN NO WAY BE CORRELATED TO THIS SURPLUS ARISING FROM THE LAST INCREMENT OF A DAYS LABOR ASSUMING  COST AND UTILITY ANNALS VOL III P 427 JANUARY I893 392VIEWS OF DISTRIBUTION THIS LATER SURPLUS TO EXIST FOR WHILE RENTS FORM AN OBJECTIVE SURPLUS THE BALANCE OF OBJECTIVE UTILITIES AFTER ABSTRACTING OBJECTIVE COSTS A SURPLUS MEASUREABLE IN MONEY THIS OTHER ALLEGED SURPLUS IS SUBJECTIVE AND OBTAINED BY A COMPARISON OF PLEASURES AND PAINS IN THE OBJECTIVE SETTING I FOUND A SINGLE SURPLUS TO EXIST AFTER ALL COSTS WERE DEFRAYED DISTRI BUTABLE HOWEVER BY A LAW OF MONOPOLY WHICH I FOUND TO BE THE TRUE AND ONLY LAW OF RENT AND WHICH OPERATES IN EXACTLY THE WAY OF THE LAW OF MONOPOLY TO WHICH PROFESSOR PATTEN REFERS THE DISTRIBUTION OF THIS  SUBJECTIVE  SURPLUS IF THEN THIS SURPLUS ARISING FROM THE LAST INCREMENT OF A DAYS LABOR EXISTS AT ALL IT BELONGS TO THE SUBJECTIVE SETTING OF DISTRIBUTION AND CANNOT BE GROUPED AS A SPECIES OF THE SAME GENUS WITH DIFFERENTIAL GAINS WHICH IN SO FAR AS THEY ARE CAUSED BY DIFFERENCES IN NATURE ARE OBJECTIVE QUAN TITIES IT IS HOWEVER THE EXISTENCE OF THIS  SURPLUS VALUE ASSIGNED TO THE LAST INCREMENT OF A DAYS LABOR THAT I WISH TO CALL INTO QUESTION IT SEEMS TO ME TO RESULT FROM AN UNJUSTIFIED RETENTION IN THE SUBJECTIVE SETTING OF DISTRIBUTION OF THAT METHOD OF SEPARATE CONSIDERATION OF EACH HOUR WHICH WAS POSSIBLE IN THE OBJECTIVE SETTING IN THE OBJECTIVE SETTING WE FOUND THAT TO EACH SEPARATE HOUR WE COULD ABSOLUTELY ASSIGN SO MANY UNITS OF COST AND SO MANY UNITS OF UTILITY BUT IT BECOMES QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO TRANSFER THIS OBJECTIVE TABLE INTO A SUBJECTIVE TABLE OF THE SAME KIND BECAUSE AS PROFESSOR PATTEN HIMSELF SHOWS WE CANNOT TREAT EACH HOURS ACTIVITY AND RENTS AS A SEPARATE THING WE ARE IN FACT UNABLE TO MAKE THE FIRST STATEMENT CONTAINED IN THE SUBJECTIVE TABLE SUGGESTED ON P 55 DURING THE FIRST HOUR O PAIN YIELDS IO SATISFACTION BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF UNITS OF SATISFACTION DUE TO THE PAINLESS EFFORT OF THIS FIRST HOUR WILL RETAINING THE HOURBYHOUR TREATMENT BE DIFFERENT ACCORDING TO THE DIFFERENT NUMBER OF WORKING HOURS IN THE DAY IT IS CLEAR THAT AT THE CLOSE OF THE  AS IN PROF PATTENS THEORY OF DYNAMIC ECONOMICS P 95 393 5758 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY FIRST HOUR WE ARE NOT IN A POSITION TO STATE WHAT THE YIELD OF SATISFACTION IS IF WE SPEAK OF IT AS IO THIS IO REFERS NOT TO THE SUBJECTIVE SATISFACTION ONLY CALCULABLE BY REFERENCE TO LATER EVENTS BUT TO SOME OBJECTIVE UTILITY WHICH IS TO YIELD THE SUBJECTIVE SATISFACTION I E WE ARE OBTAINING OUR SURPLUS

HOUR OF LABOR WILL SHOW A SURPLUS OF SATISFACTION OVER PAIN IF THE EFFECT OF A LONGER WORKING DAY IN DIMINISHING THE SUB JECTIVE UTILITY OF EARLIER PRODUCTS BE LEFT OUT OF CONSIDERATION NO SCIENTIFIC OBJECT CAN BE GAINED BY THIS METHOD OF MEASUR ING SEPARABLY THINGS WHICH ARE ORGANICALLY RELATED TO ONE ANOTHER THE NET SATISFACTION OF A 2HOUR AND A 3HOUR DAY IN THE ABOVE SCHEME ARE EQUAL BUT IN THE 2HOUR DAY A LARGER PROPORTION OF THE SATISFACTION IS DERIVED FROM A FULLER CONSUMPTION OF THE OBJECTIVE UTILITIES THAN IN THE 3HOUR DAY WHERE A LARGER NUMBER OF OBJECTIVE UTILITIES ARE LESS EFFEC TIVELY CONSUMED IN TAKING A PURELY SUBJECTIVE VIEW OF THE QUESTION WE MUST CONFINE OURSELVES PURELY TO THE RECKONING OF PAINS AND SATISFACTIONS THERE MAY BE SOME QUESTION WHETHER THE INJURY DONE TO CONSUMPTION BY AN INCREASED WORKING DAY SHOULD BE RECKONED AS DIMINISHED SATISFACTION OR AS INCREASED PAIN BUT THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR MAKING OF IT THE BASIS OF A SPECIAL AND SEPARATE FUND A SURPLUS VALUE DISTRIBUTABLE BY A SEPARATE LAW FROM THAT ACCORDING TO WHICH THE REST OF THE SURPLUS OF SATISFACTION IS DISTRIBUTED TO DO THIS IS TO GO BACK TO THE CONSIDERATION OF OBJECTIVE UTILITIES AND TO CONSIDER THEM AS GROWING AND SHRINKING ACCORDING AS THE TIME TO CONSUME THEM IS LARGER OR SHORTER IN CON SIDERING THE EFFECT OF SHORTENING OR LENGTHENING THE WORKING DAY OF ANY CLASS OF WORKERS THE EFFECT UPON THEIR REAL WAGES BY AN EXTENSION OR A DIMINUTION OF THE TIME OF CONSUMPTION MUST BE CLEARLY KEPT IN VIEW BUT WE ARE NOT JUSTIFIED IN MAKING THIS CONSIDERATION THE BASIS OF A SEPARATE FUND AS A FACTOR AFFECTING THE NET UTILITY OF A WORKING DAY IT MAY BE RANKED WITH OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS THOSE WHICH AFFECT THE INTENSITY OF LABOR OR IMPROVE THE CHARACTER OF LABOR BY INCREASED VARIETY AND INTEREST OF EXERTION OR GIVE MORE VARIETY OR INDIVIDUALITY TO STANDARDS OF CONSUMPTION THE EFFECT OF A SHORTER OR A LARGER WORKING DAY UPON THE NET 395 5960 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY PLUS OF SATISFACTION IS ONLY ONE OF A NUMBER OF CONSIDERATIONS WHICH BY THEIR MUTUAL ACTION AND REACTION DETERMINE THE NET SURPLUS OF SATISFACTION EACH FORCE IS SUBJECT TO SPECIAL LAWS DETERMINING ITS ACTION BUT WHEN IT HAS EXPRESSED ITSELF BY INFLUENCING THE SURPLUS OF SATISFACTION IT IS MERGED IN THIS AGGREGATE WE ARE THUS UNABLE TO FIND WITH PROFESSOR PATTEN A SUR PLUS IN THE LAST INCREMENT OF A NORMAL DAYS LABOR THE EXAMPLE OF A WORKING DAY GIVEN ABOVE WILL MAKE IT EVI DENT THAT FROM A DETACHED VIEW OF THE UNITS OF SUBJECTIVE COST AND UTILITY IN REFERENCE TO PARTS OF THE WORKING DAY WE CAN OBTAIN NO USEFUL RESULTS FOR WE ARE APPLYING AN OBJECTIVE SEPARATIST METHOD TO THINGS THAT ARE SUBJECTIVE AND INSEPARABLE WHEN THE UTILITY PRODUCED IN THE SECOND HOUR IS RECKONED SUBJECTIVELY IT IS UNREASONABLE TO EXCLUDE FROM THE ESTIMATE OF ITS COST THE DEPRECIATION OF THE FIRST SUBJECTIVE UTILITY OCCA SIONED BY THE VERY CONDITIONS TO WHICH THE SECOND UTILITY OWES ITS EXISTENCE THE SUBJECTIVE CONSIDERATION OF COSTS AND UTILITIES OF A WORKING DAY AS A WHOLE WILL THUS YIELD A SINGLE  SURPLUS WHICH WILL RISE AND FALL IN AMOUNT ACCORDING AS THE INCREASING LENGTH AFFECTS THE TOTAL SUBJECTIVE UTILITY INVOLVED IN THE CONSUMPTION OF THE LARGER OR SMALLER OBJECTIVE UTILITY THIS VIEW OF THE SINGLE SUBJECTIVE SURPLUS OF THE INDIVIDUAL MAY BE DIRECTLY TRANSFERRED TO THE LARGER SCALE OF A SOCIETY SO THAT A GIVEN DISPOSITION OF WORKING INDIVIDUALS IN A SOCIETY WILL YIELD A SINGLE AGGREGATE SUBJECTIVE SURPLUS WHICH WILL BE THE REPRESENTATIVE IN SUBJECTIVE TERMS OF THAT AGGREGATE OF RENTS WHICH FORM THE SINGLE OBJECTIVE SURPLUS THE FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE OF CLEARLY TRACING THE RELA TIONS BETWEEN THE OBJECTIVE AND THE SUBJECTIVE SOCIAL SURPLUS IS WHAT MOST ECONOMISTS IN THE PAST HAVE FAILED TO REALIZE THE OBJECTIVE ECONOMIC TREATMENT CONCERNED ITSELF WITH QUANTITIES OF PRODUCTIVE FORCES EMBODIED IN THE FORMS OF OBJECTIVE UTILITIES DIVIDED SIMPLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RESPECTIVE QUANTITIES OF THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF PRODUCTIVE 396VIEWS OF DISTRIBUTION FORCES ENGAGED IT WAS NOT PROPERLY CONCERNED WITH THE QUESTIONS WHO EXERTED THESE FORCES HOW WERE THESE UTILITIES CONSUMED THE ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS MAKE NO DIFFERENCE IN ESTIMATING THE QUANTITY OF OBJECTIVE WEALTH BUT IN THE SUBJECTIVE MEASUREMENT OF WEALTH IT MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE WHOSE PAIN GAVE THE PRODUCTIVE FORCE AND INTO WHOSE PLEASURES THE OBJECTIVE GOODS WERE RESOLVED FOR UPON THIS DETAILED PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE DEPENDS OUR KNOW LEDGE OF THE QUANTITY OF SUBJECTIVE WEALTH THE SAME QUANTITY OF OBJECTIVE UTILITIES WILL REPRESENT A SMALL QUANTITY OF SUBJECTIVE UTILITIES IF THEY EMBODY A LARGE AMOUNT OF PAIN AND YIELD A SMALL AMOUNT OF SATISFACTION AND VICE VERSA THE GIST OF ALL ETHICAL CRITICISM DIRECTED AGAINST ECONOMICS HAS REFERENCE TO ITS NEGLECT TO CLEARLY TRACE THE RELATION BETWEEN THE QUANTITY OF OBJECTIVE AND OF SUBJECTIVE WEALTH IN A COMMUNITY THE CHARGES RAISED AGAINST MODEM METHODS OF INDUSTRIAL DISTRIBUTION REFER TO THE FACT THAT SUCH DISTRIBUTION IS VOID OF ANY SOCIAL GUARANTEE INSURING THAT AN INCREASE OF THE OBJECTIVE SURPLUS SHALL BE ACCOMPANIED BY ANY INCREASE IN THE SUBJECTIVE SURPLUS OR THAT IT SHALL NOT BE ATTENDED BY AN ABSOLUTE DECREASE OF THE SOCIAL SUBJECTIVE SURPLUS WHAT RELATION NATURALLY SUBSISTS BETWEEN THE OBJECTIVE AND THE SUBJECTIVE SURPLUSES THE SEPARATE ORIGIN AND CHAR ACTER OF WHICH I HAVE TRIED TO TRACE  THE LAW EXPRESSING THIS RELATION IS A SIMPLE ONE AND MAY BE SET FORTH IN FAMILIAR PHRASES ANY GIVEN PIECE OF OBJECTIVE WEALTH EXPANDS SUB JECTIVELY ACCORDING AS ITS PAIN OF PRODUCTION IS SMALL AND ITS PLEASURE OF CONSUMPTION GREAT HENCE A PIECE OF WEALTH IN ORDER TO BE MEASURED SUBJECTIVELY REQUIRES ANSWERS TO THE TWO QUESTIONS WHO PRODUCES IT AND UNDER WHAT CONDI TIONS    WHO CONSUMES IT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS   IN ORDER TO ATTAIN ITS MAXIMUM AS A HUMAN GOOD IT MUST BE PRODUCED WITH THE LEAST HUMAN PAIN AND SATISFY THE GREATEST NEED THE PHRASE  FROM EACH ACCORDING TO HIS POWERS TO EACH ACCORDING TO HIS NEEDS EXPRESSES THE IDEAL DISTRIBU TION THUS WOULD THE BENEVOLENT DESPOT STRIVE TO ORGANIZE 39762 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY SOCIETY THUS WOULD THE COMPLETELY CIVILIZED DEMOCRACY STRIVE TO ORGANIZE ITSELF NO COMFORT WOULD BE SUPPLIED UNTIL ALL HAD THE NECESSARIES NO LUXURY UNTIL ALL HAD THE COMFORTS ANY BREACH OF THIS RULE HOWEVER JUSTIFIABLE UPON OTHER GROUNDS SIGNIFIES DIRECTLY THAT AN OBJECTIVE GOOD IS CONVERTED INTO A SMALLER INSTEAD OF A GREATER SUBJECTIVE UTILITY SO ON THE OTHER HAND NO OBJECTIVE COST MUST BE EXTRACTED FROM A WHEN IT CAN BE GOT WITH LESS PAIN FROM B THIS HOWEVER DOES NOT DEMAND ABSOLUTE EQUALITY MEASURED BY OUR ORDINARY IDEAS OF EFFORT AND ENJOYMENT ONE PERSON HAS WHAT WE CALL GREATER CAPACITIES FOR WORK AND FOR ENJOYMENT STRICTLY SPEAKING HE WHO IS CAPABLE OF MOST ENJOYING OR MAKING THE BEST TOTAL USE OF ANYTHING OUGHT TO HAVE IT EVEN THOUGH HE ALREADY HAS A LARGER SUPPLY OF THE COMMODITY THAN ANOTHER SO HE WHO LIKES TO PUT FORTH EFFORT OR LEAST DISLIKES IT SHOULD BE CALLED UPON TO DO SO THE NET ULTIMATE PAIN ON THE ONE HAND AND PLEASURE ON THE OTHER ARE THE TRUE TESTS OF THE IDEAL DISTRIBUTION BUT HERE AGAIN I SHOULD NOT CONSENT TO TAKE THE DIRECT CONSCIOUS PLEASURE OR PAIN AS THE TEST THE POSITIONS INVOLVED IN AN ACCEPTANCE OF PROFESSOR PATTENS DISTINCTION OF POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE UTILITIES HIS VIEW THAT THE CALIBRE OF A MAN OR OF A SOCIETY IS TO BE MEASURED BY THE QUANTITY OF POSITIVE SATISFACTIONS CONSCIOUSLY REFERABLE TO SPECIFIC ACTS OF CONSUMPTION SEEMS TO ME UNTENABLE AND IF ACCEPTED WOULD LEAD UP TO AN IDEAL OF DISTRIBUTION PALPABLY UNJUST AND EVEN SELFDESTRUCTIVE I UNDERSTAND HIM TO CONTEND THAT A LUXURY IS WORTH MORE THAN A NECESSARY BECAUSE WE APPRECIATE IT MORE HIGHLY AND THAT ONLY IN PROPORTION AS WE RISE ABOVE THE CONSCIOUS RELISH OF NECESSARIES DO WE ATTAIN A CIVILIZED LEVEL OF CONSUMPTION PEACHES HAVE A HIGHER  POSITIVE  UTILITY THAN BREAD BECAUSE WE GET A HIGHER CONSCIOUS SATISFACTION FROM EATING THEM PRO FESSOR PATTEN OBJECTS TO THE NEGATIVE METHOD OF ESTIMATING A THINGS  UTILITY  BY THE EFFECT OF ITS WITHDRAWAL BUT HE LAYS STRESS UPON THE IMPORTANT PART OF THE POSITIVE  UTILITY OF A 398VIEWS OF DISTRIBUTION GOOD WHICH ARISES FROM ITS HARMONIOUS COMPOSITION OF OTHER GOODS NOW BREAD AND ANY OTHER FUNDAMENTAL UNIT OF CONSUMP TION MUST BE REGARDED AS INSEPARABLE FROM THE CONSUMPTION OF THE POSITIVE UTILITIES OF WHICH IT IS THE NECESSARY CONDITION THOUGH WE MAY GET LITTLE DIRECT CONSCIOUS PLEASURE FROM EATING BREAD THE VITALITY IT SUSTAINS ENTERS INTO EVERY HIGHER UNIT OF CONSCIOUS ENJOYMENT HENCE THE NECESSARIES YIELD THE LARGEST ENJOYMENT RECKONED IN CONSCIOUSNESS AND MEASURING UTILITY IN CONSCIOUS SATISFACTION THE LARGEST UTILITY IS GIVEN TO A COMMODITY BY ENABLING IT TO SATISFY THE MOST URGENT NEEDS SO REVERSELY CERTAIN PAINS TO WHICH WE HAVE BECOME INURED MUST BE RECKONED AS POSITIVE DISABILI TIES THE HARDWORKING LABORER OFTEN DOES NOT CONSCIOUSLY VALUE A HOLIDAY OR ANY FORM OF REMISSION FROM HIS CUSTOMARY WORK BUT THE OVERWORK IS AN EVIL FOR ALL THAT AND MORE OVER AN EVIL WHICH IN VARIOUS WAYS IS REPRESENTED EITHER IN IMPAIRED PHYSICAL ENJOYMENT OR IN OTHER VITAL LOSSES THE CONSCIOUS ENJOYMENT OF NATURE BOOKS ART AND OTHER THINGS OF WHICH HE IS DEPRIVED BY EXCESSIVE TOIL FURTHER ACCEPTING PROFESSOR PATTENS THEORY OF POSITIVE UTILITIES IT WOULD SEEM TO FOLLOW THAT A SMALL NUMBER OF MEN WITH HIGHLY REFINED AND ELABORATE TASTES WOULD REPRESENT A LARGER QUANTITY OF  POSITIVE UTILITIES  IN THEIR CONSUMPTION THAN A LARGER SOCIETY WHOSE EVENLY APPORTIONED CONSUMPTION CONTAINED A LARGER PROPORTION OF  NEGATIVE UTILITIES DRIV ING THIS TO ITS LOGICAL CONCLUSION IT WOULD APPEAR THAT IN ANY GIVEN SOCIETY A LARGER NET AMOUNT OF POSITIVE UTILITY COULD BE ACHIEVED BY THE ABNORMAL CULTIVATION OF A SINGLE PERSON TO A PITCH OF HIGHEST POSITIVE ENJOYMENT THAN BY ANY OTHER DISPOSITION OF UTILITIES WHATSOEVER THE NEWEST UTILITY IS ADMITTEDLY THE ONE TO WHICH HIGHEST ATTENTION IS GIVEN AND WHICH MUST FIGURE MOST LARGELY IN CONSCIOUSNESS SO THAT A SINGLE MAN CONTINUALLY PLIED WITH NOVEL LUXURIES MIGHT YIELD A LARGER AMOUNT OF  POSITIVE UTILITY  THAN ANY NUM BER OF PERSONS LESS DEVELOPED AND KEPT TO A LOWER HABITUAL STANDARD OF COMFORT I DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT PROFESSOR PATTEN 399 6364 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY WILL ACCEPT THESE CONCLUSIONS BUT THEY CERTAINLY SEEM TO ME TO FLOW LOGICALLY FROM HIS PREMISES MY OBJECTION AGAINST PROFESSOR PATTENS ESTIMATE OF SUB JECTIVE  UTILITY  IS IDENTICAL WITH THAT WHICH I RAISED AGAINST HIS ESTIMATE OF SUBJECTIVE  COST JUST AS IT SEEMED BEST THAT SUBJECTIVE COST SHOULD INCLUDE ALL PAINS DIRECT OR INDIRECT RESULTING FROM THE ACTIVITY WHICH FOUND EXPRESSION IN OBJECTIVE COST SO LIKEWISE SUBJECTIVE UTILITY MUST INCLUDE ALL PLEASURES DIRECT AND INDIRECT MY CHARGE AGAINST PROFESSOR PATTEN IS THAT HE APPEARS TO EXCLUDE FROM HIS POSITIVE UTILITIES  LARGE ELEMENTS OF SATISFACTION WHICH THE SECRET AND COMPLEX PROCESSES OF VITALITY PREVENT THE CONSCIOUSNESS FROM DISTINCTLY REFERRING TO THEIR TRUE SOURCES IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE INDEED IN TREATING THIS SUBJECT IN ORDER TO PREVENT ANY MIS UNDERSTANDINGS ABOUT THE MEANINGS OF PLEASURE AND PAIN TO GO BEHIND THESE TERMS AND TO IDENTIFY  COST  AND UTILITY WITH GAIN AND LOSS OF VITALITY IN HIS MOST VALUABLE ANALYSIS PROFESSOR PATTEN HAS SHOWN HOW THE UTILITY ARISING FROM THE CONSUMPTION OF A PARTICULAR OBJECTIVE UTILITY DEPENDS UPON ITS RELATION TO OTHER UTILITIES FORMING PART OF THE CONSUMPTION OF THE SAME INDIVIDUAL TRACING THE INTRICATE RESULTS WHICH THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW CONSUMABLE WILL HAVE UPON THE GROUP OF COMMODITIES WITH WHICH IT IS BROUGHT INTO CLOSER OR MORE DISTANT RELATIONS E G THE EFFECT OF A NEW FOOD UPON THE TOTAL UTILITY OF THE DIET AND ALSO THE EFFECTS UPON OTHER UTILITIES AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE TOTAL UTILITY OF THE DIET EQUIVALENT EFFECTS MAY BE TRACED ON THE SIDE OF COSTS EACH NEW INCREMENT IN AN OLD CLASS OF PAIN EACH INTRODUCTION OF A NEW PAIN OR COST WILL OPERATE UPON THE OTHER ELEMENTS OF COST WHICH GO TO MAKE UP THE AGGREGATE SUBJECTIVE COST THE SAME LAWS OF HARMONY ETC WHICH PROFESSOR PATTEN SO SKILLFULLY TRACES IN UTILITY WILL HAVE THEIR CORRESPONDING LAWS IN COST THE VIEW OF DISTRIBUTION PRESENTED IN THIS PAPER MAY BE THUS SUMMARISED THERE IS A SINGLE OBJECTIVE SURPLUS CONSISTING OF THOSE GOODS AND SERVICES OR THEIR EQUIVALENT 400VIEWS OF DISTRIBUTION IN MONEY WHICH REMAIN TO BE DISTRIBUTED AFTER ALL THOSE WHO HAVE PUT FORTH PERSONAL EFFORT IN PRODUCTION HAVE RECEIVED WHAT IS SUFFICIENT TO INDUCE THE CONTINUANCE OF SUCH PERSONAL EFFORT I E AFTER THE STRICT EXPENSES OF PRODUCTION HAVE BEEN DEFRAYED THIS SURPLUS IS DISTRIBUTED AS  RENTS  TO THE OWNERS OF SUCH REQUISITES OF PRODUCTION AS ARE RELATIVELY SHORT IN SUPPLY AT THE SEVERAL POINTS IN PRODUCTION THERE IS ALSO A SINGLE SUBJECTIVE SURPLUS WHICH AT ANY GIVEN TIME CONSISTS IN THE AGGREGATE OF HUMAN SATISFACTION RENDERED BY THE CONSUMPTION OF THIS OBJECTIVE SURPLUS DIVIDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF MONOPOLY RENT THE AMOUNT OF SUBJECTIVE SURPLUS RELATED TO A GIVEN QUANTITY OF OBJECTIVE SURPLUS MAY VARY INDEFINITELY PRO DUCED BY THE EXCESSIVE TOIL OF ONE CLASS OF A COMMUNITY AND CONSUMED BY THE EXCESSIVE LUXURY OF ANOTHER CLASS IT REPRE SENTS A MINIMUM OF SUBJECTIVE SURPLUS OR HUMAN WELFARE PRODUCED BY THE EQUAL SACRIFICE OF ALL AND CONSUMED IN SATIS FACTION OF THE EQUAL NEEDS OF ALL IT REPRESENTS THE MAXIMUM SUBJECTIVE SURPLUS THE HISTORY OF THE ACTUAL DISTRIBUTION OF PAINS AND UTILITIES IN CONNECTION WITH A GIVEN QUANTITY OF OBJECTIVE WEALTH IN INDUSTRIAL SOCIETIES PRESENTS AN INFINITE NUMBER OF POSSIBLE STAGES BETWEEN THESE TWO EXTREMES OF FELICITY AND MISERY HOW FAR THE ACTUAL DISTRIBUTION IN A SOCIETY APPROXIMATES TO THE IDEALLY BEST OR THE IDEALLY WORST CONDITION DEPENDS ENTIRELY UPON THE OPERATION OF THOSE FORCES WHICH APPORTION THE CONSUMPTION OF THE OBJECTIVE SURPLUS OR RENTS UNDER PRESENT CONDITIONS IT APPEARS THAT THE APPOR TIONMENT IS RULED BY FORCES SOCIAL POLITICAL ECONOMIC WHICH ASSIGN VARIOUS AND SHIFTING AMOUNTS OF MONOPOLISTIC POWER TO THE OWNERS OF THE REQUISITES OF PRODUCTION AND THAT THE OPERATION OF THESE FORCES IS TO NO APPRECIABLE EXTENT AFFECTED BY CONSIDERATIONS DRAWN FROM ANY ESTIMATE OF THE SUBJECTIVE SURPLUS OR NET GAIN OF HUMAN WELFARE A FINAL RESULT YIELDED BY THIS ANALYSIS IS THE RECOGNITION THAT SINCE THE SUBJECTIVE SURPLUS DERIVED FROM A GIVEN QUANTITY OF OBJECTIVE SURPLUS MAY BE EXPANDED OR CONTRACTED WITHOUT ASSIGNABLE LIMITS BY 401 6566 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY DIMINUTION OF SUBJECTIVE COST BY ENHANCEMENT OF SUBJECTIVE UTILTY OR BY A COMBINATION OF THESE PROCESSES SOCIETY IS NOT SO FAR AS ITS TRUE SATISFACTION OR LIFE IS CONCERNED AT THE MERCY OF MERE QUANTITY OF OBJECTIVE WEALTH OR  MARKET VALUES ECONOMIES OF PAINFUL EFFORT ON THE ONE HAND OF PLEASURABLE USES ON THE OTHER ARE CAPABLE OF SUCH CONTINUOUS ADVANCE AS TO RENDER A SOCIETY INDEPENDENT OF THE NECESSITY OF A CONTINUOUS INCREASE OF OBJECTIVE WEALTH FOR ITS INCREASED HAPPINESS IN OUR ANALYSIS BOTH UPON ITS OBJECTIVE AND ITS SUBJECTIVE SIDE COST HAS BEEN MOST CLOSELY ATTACHED TO THE ART OF PRO DUCTION UTILITY TO THAT OF CONSUMPTION BUT A LARGE PART OF HUMAN PROGRESS WILL CONSIST NOT MERELY IN A DIMINUTION OF THE PAIN OF PRODUCTION AND AN ENHANCEMENT OF THE PLEASURE OF CONSUMPTION BUT IN DRAWING EVEN INTO CLOSER RELATION THE ARTS OF PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION AND WORK ING UNTO NEARER ASSOCIATION THE TWO ACTIVITIES THUS WHILE FOR PURPOSES OF ESTIMATE WE CANNOT DISPENSE WITH THE ANTITHETICAL CHARACTER OF COST AND UTILITY THE PRODUC TION OF A PROGRESSIVE SOCIETY WILL HAVE ITS UNITS OF  UTILITY  IN EVEN CLOSER CASUAL RELATION TO ITS UNITS OF  COST THE CON SUMPTION OF SUCH A SOCIETY BEING LINKED IN DETAILED ORGANIC CONNECTION TO ITS PRODUCTION THE WORK AND LIFE OF THE TRUE ARTIST  BY SUFFUSING EFFORT WITH ENJOYMENT HAS FROM THE INDIVIDUAL STANDPOINT ADVANCED FURTHEST ALONG THIS ROAD BUT ALL PRODUCTIVE WORK HAS IN IT SOME ELEMENT OF ART SOME PART OF THE EFFORT EXERCISES INDIVIDUALITY SO AS TO YIELD A UNIT OF PERSONAL PLEASURE AND REFORMATION OF THE INDUSTRIAL ARTS MAY EXPAND THIS ELEMENT INDEFINITELY IN PROPORTION AS EACH INDUSTRY IS CAPABLE OF THIS TRANSFORMATION INTO AN ART UNITS OF PAINFUL EFFORT MAY BE COMPENSATED OR EVEN SUP PLANTED BY UNITS OF ENJOYMENT SO THAT THE VERY PROCESSES OF PRODUCTION DOMINATED HITHERTO BY COST  MAY GROW MORE AND MORE INTO PROCESSES OF CONSUMPTION DOMINATED BY ENJOYMENT IN A MEASUREMENT OF INDIVIDUAL OR SOCIAL LIFE WE CANNOT DISPENSE WITH THE ANTITHETICAL TERMS PLEASURE 402VIEWS OF DISTRIBUTION PAIN EFFORT UTILITY YET IT WILL BECOME INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO APPLY THE MEASUREMENT TO PARTICULAR CASES OF CONSCIOUS ACTIVITY IN LIFE WHO SHALL SAY WHAT IS  COST  AND WHAT  UTILITY  IN TLLE ACTIVITY OF A GENUINE ARTIST A SOCIETY COMPOSED OF SUCH INDIVIDUALS IS THE NOBLE IDEAL WHICH THAT MOST ENLIGHTENED AND POETIC OF POLITICAL ECONOMISTS JOHN RUSKIN HAS LONG HELD OUT BEFORE OUR EYES COST AND UTILITY LIFE AND WORK WOULD BE WELDED INTO AN INSEPARABLE SYNTHESIS IN THE LIFE OF THE TRUE SOCIETY WHAT MAKES PROGRESS THIS WAY SO SLOW IS THE CRUDE QUAN TITATIVE CONSUMPTION WHICH PREVAILS IN OUR MODERN INDUS TRIAL SOCIETIES WHOSE DIRECTING CONTROL FORCES PRODUCTION TO PARTAKE OF THE SAME CHARACTER THIS WILL CONTINUE SO LONG AND SO FAR AS THE ARTS OF PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION ARE UNNATURALLY SEVERED BY HANDING OVER TO CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS AND CLASSES AN ECONOMIC POWER TO CONSUME WITHOUT PRODUC ING THE POWER OF A RICH MAN TO CONSUME AS THE LAST ITEM OF HIS LEASTPRIZED LUXURY THAT ARTICLE WHOSE PRODUCTION HAS COST THE HARDESTWORKED PRODUCER HIS LAST AND MOST PAINFUL UNIT OF EFFORT MAKES THE CONQUEST OF ART OVER UTILITY IMPOS SIBLE FOR THE PRESENT EVERY EQUALIZATION OF ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY REPRESENTS A DOUBLE GAIN FOR IT NOT ONLY GIVES A HIGHER SUBJECTIVE UTILITY TO EACH UNIT OF CONSUMPTION BUT IT LESSENS THE SUBJECTIVE COST OF EACH UNIT OF PRODUCTION AS IT INCREASES UTILITY AND DIMINISHES COST SO IT ALSO BRINGS TOGETHER THE ARTS OF PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION WHICH MEETING AND FUSING IN EVERY ARTISTIC ACTIVITY OR EFFORT WOULD FIND THEIR IDEAL IDENTI FICATION IN A SOCIETY WHERE WORK WAS LIFE AND WHERE THE ART OF LIVING WAS PERFECTED THIS GROWING IDENTIFICATION OF WORK AND LIFE SHOULD BE REGARDED AS THE MARK AND TEST OF TRUE SOCIAL PROGRESS BECAUSE THE SOCIETY WHICH HAS ADVANCED FURTHEST THIS WAY WILL BE THE SOCIETY WHOSE SURPLUS OF SUB JECTIVE UTILITY OVER COST WILL BE THE LARGEST AND WHICH WILL THEREFORE ENJOY THE LARGEST QUANTITY AND VALUE OF LIFE LONDON JOHN A HOBSON 403 67

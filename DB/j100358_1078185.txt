j100358,The School Review,1078185,The Teachers School Week,i244748,THE TEACHERS SCHOOL WEEK JOHN T GREENAN East Orange Educational Council East Orange New Jersey Much of the current literature in the field of school administra tion opens up ways and means whereby the efficiency of the schools may be increased Our attention is called to better methods of following up student scholarship new cumulative card index systems the elimination of tardiness and absence improving school morale student government extracurriculum activities grouping students according to ability the use of standardized tests and supervised study These are just a few of the many recent develop ments in education which must be made a part of the progressive school system The question naturally arises as to how these things may be most efficiently handled The principal of the school cannot hope to do more than supervise their installation The ideal way would be for the principal to have a sufficient number of well trained office assistants to handle much of the routine clerical work Unfortunately the ordinary taxpayer thinks of a school as a place where men and women merely teach he does not realize that today the modern city school is a very complex organization One could not imagine an industry comprising a superintendent seventy foremen and seventeen hundred workers getting along with an office force of two or three clerks Yet that is exactly what is demanded of the school principal of today Many educators suggest that the pupils can very easily do much of the office work But is it fair to the pupil  If the students can perform these tasks in addition to their daily work our system is wasting much valuable time The faithful student has no time to spare so that such duties usually fall upon the individual who is willing to do almost anything except the required work It is probably nearer the truth to say that the time devoted to such 592THE TEACHERS SCHOOL WEEK 593 clerical work could very much more profitably be spent by the child in actual school work Educational experts say that the able administrator is the one who can delegate these duties to committees of teachers It is generally admitted that the ideal way would be to have more office help but since such help is not available these duties must be assumed by the teacher Because of war conditions most of our teachers are already taxed severely by exceedingly large classes Along with the development of democracy there has come the ideal that the teacher is instructing individuals not classes The ideal teacher today is the one who can see the good in every child and help to develop that desirable quality School life is being changed from a heartless survival of the fittest to a process of helping the unfit to become fit Our publicschool teachers are struggling along under these burdens and are fully capable of bearing them but if the process of delegating administrative duties to teachers continues what will be its effect on the quality of teaching  This problem is a vital one in our public school system today In the hope of getting some light on this problem a question naire was submitted to the teachers of the East Orange High School The principal office assistants and teachers assisted with a fine spirit of cooperation in the attempt to solve a problem in which they were so much interested The questionnaire was left with the teachers for one month during which they were asked to keep a record of the time they gave to the various duties enumerated In order to estimate each teachers school week the number of hours devoted to these duties was added to the number of hours spent in school and from this total was deducted the time allowed the teacher in free periods Fiftythree teachers including commercial domestic science and manual training teachers filled in questionnaires The questionnaire with the minimum the average and the maximum time spent by the fiftythree teachers is presented in Table I Of course not all of the teachers have all of the duties enumerated Before going into a discussion of the results of this investigation a word of explanation is necessary The writer does not claim594 THE SCHOOL REVIEW October that the data are accurate The most that can be said of any questionnaire is that the conclusions drawn are of more value than the usual guesses which are offered A questionnaire is only TABLE I NUMBER OF MINUTES Mini Aver Maxi mum age mum i To what department do you belong Do you have a home room  How many

are approximately correct Any exaggeration entering into the estimates of individual teachers1922 THE TEACHERS SCHOOL WEEK 595 will be more than offset by additional time spent but not included in the questionnaire Question No i was included in order to get some idea of the accuracy of judgment A homeroom teacher having charge of seventy pupils everything else being equal would average higher than a teacher who does not have a home room A practical arts or domestic science teacher would be expected to rate low on the seventh and eighth questions Question No 7 is of especial interest because we frequently hear the complaint of parents that pupils do not get sufficient indi vidual help from teachers after school Table II shows very clearly that the teachers are spending a great deal of time after school helping backward students Under arts department were included teachers of manual arts household arts domestic science practical arts and physical education Under academic were included mathematics languages and the social sciences TABLE II AVERAGE NUMBER OF MINUTES DEPARTMENT PER WEEK SPENT IN HELPING STUDENTS AFTER SCHOOL Arts Commercial Science Academic 0 99  7 0 0 4 loo199  I 4 2

and the work done by manual training teachers in care of shop apparatus Question No 23 in regard to the ideal school week for teachers brought answers varying from thirty to fortyfive hours with an average for all teachers of approximately forty hours The actual time spent in and out of school on school work averaged fortyfour and onequarter hours A fortyhour school week seems very reasonable when we consider that the present tendency among laborers is to demand a fortyfour or fortyeighthour week A596 THE SCHOOL REVIEW October fortyhour week is the customary one required of office employees in most of our large corporations It must be remembered that very nearly all teachers do much reading of professional literature and many are taking university extension courses in addition to their fortyfourhour week These facts are in great contrast to the idea quite common that a teacher works thirty hours a week It may be that the average for East Orange High School is very high because of the great amount of time spent by teachers after school in assisting backward pupils and in supervising extra curriculum activities The school session comprising seven periods begins at 830 and closes at 230 with a twoshift lunch period of twentyfive minutes In this school of seventeen hundred students there are nineteen clubs meeting at the close of school once a week or once in two weeks In addition to the usual athletic teams and musical clubs each of the following organizations is supervised by a faculty adviser the Outing Club four debating clubs the Mathematics Club the Rifle Club the East Orange High School News issued twice monthly Quod and Quoin Club Drama Study Club French Club Spanish Club Scientific Club Chess Club Secretarial Club Short Story Club Student Council General Organization and the Camouflage Club Question No 24 brought the following suggestions for increas ing the efficiency of the system i Seven teachers merely suggested more clerical help in the office 2 Four teachers suggested a book room with a teacher in charge 3 Three teachers suggested that registers report cards and checking of studyhall lists should be done in the office 4 Three teachers suggested that a special teacher be engaged to do tutoring 5 Two teachers stated that a teacher should have energy to develop enthusiasm for her work and not have much of it used up in clerks duties 6 A dean for each year who is free to spend two hours a day advising students 7  Work included under the eleventh fourteenth and fifteenth questionsteacher could be relieved of 75 per cent of19221 THE TEACHERS SCHOOL WEEK 597 the work by extra office force at the special times during the year when this work is done 8 Select efficient students to do some of the clerical work of the teachers 9 Special teachers for studyhall work Io If the school were less crowded and we began new classes at midyear the failing students could be eliminated from class more than at present ii Dropping from school a few of the students who are not making profitable use of their time would lighten our work 12 In regard to No 7 eliminate the shirkers more rigorously and make the students realize that school is a privilege to be respected It is bad pedagogy to carry so much dead weight in after school hours 13 If the building were less crowded so that a teacher could have full use of his classroom in free periods and after school one could work more efficiently 14 In regard to No 2 make the office a clearinghouse for all tardy and absence information excuses and absentee slips including class absences and tardiness 15 Extracurriculum activities should be carried on during the school session in a special period provided for them 16 Less duplication in the process of recording and issuing quarterly marks It seems to the writer significant first that although free opportunity was given to the teachers to criticize the management TABLE III Number of Percentage Hours Teaching  3I1 706 Clerical 36 71 Advisory  3 0 70 Disciplinary  61 152 of the school there were few practical criticisms made It must be remembered that the teachers did not sign their names to the questionnaire Second all of the valuable suggestions point to598 THE SCHOOL REVIEW either insufficient office help or to the burden of helping backward or delinquent students These questions merely give the average amount of time spent by the average teacher in addition to the regular school week It was necessary to add the time spent during the regular school hours Table III shows the distribution of the average teachers time during a week of fortyfour and onequarter hours SUMMARY i The efficient school system of today must be prepared to adopt those new ideas which are being advanced by educational experts 2 These new ideas usually demand additional effort on the part of someone in the school system 3 At present the teacher is being overburdened with non teaching duties and at times is compelled to devote recitation periods to clerical work 4 If this tendency continues the quality of teaching will proportionately deteriorate 5 The teachers of the East Orange High School believe that it is fair to expect from the teacher a fortyhour week not including time spent on professional reading or university extension courses 6 The teachers of the East Orange High School are devoting about fortyfour and onequarter hours to school work not includ ing time spent on professional reading and university extension work 7 Approximately 706 per cent of this time is being devoted to teaching duties After all the primary purpose of the school is to teach and ways and means are being devised to obtain better prepared teachers and to give them adequate buildings and apparatus The fact must not be overlooked that all of this will be in vain if the enthusi asm of the teacher is destroyed by a multiplicity of details which might more efficiently be handled by an adequate office force

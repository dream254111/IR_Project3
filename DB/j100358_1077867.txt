Rhode Island It is a commonplace that history and English admirably supple ment each other but it is open to question whether the greatest possible advantage has been taken of this fact in planning high school courses in the two subjects There is abundant available readingmatter which has historical value as well as literary sig nificance and which is quite as well worth reading as many of the English classics already in the readinglists Indeed some of the books now commonly read may serve the purposes of history as well as of English if read from that point of view Moreover historical material affords excellent subjectmatter for oral and written expression for the pupil has something definite to say and this he must needs learn to state clearly and with precision Fur ther there is ample opportunity in teaching history to help the pupil to establish the desirable habit of reading rapidly intelligently and with discernment The plan of work hereinafter set forth has been adopted in the belief that by making the most of the possibilities of these two subjects a certain number of recitation periods per week can be saved while meeting all legitimate requirements In view of the many subjects which clamor for attention a saving of even two periods a week for one year is worth some consideration In order to forestall obvious criticisms it may as well be stated at once that the validity of the method of procedure here suggested has not been subjected to scientific investigation and is not verified by irrefutable statistical data Nor has it been under observation long enough to draw final conclusions as to its ultimate success The only statement to be made at present is the unscientific one that the plan seems to work well It is therefore offered rather as a suggestion than as a certified specific This however may be 480ANCIENT HISTORY AND ENGLISH 481 said that the present arrangement was not made as the result of sudden impulse but has been a matter of gradual development Three years ago in making some slight rearrangement of the work in English it seemed logical to put the required reading of the Iliad and the Odyssey in the same year as the course in Ancient History to select other readingmatter which should preserve the unity of the years work and to make it all contribute as much as possible to the course in history At the same time the duty of the teacher of history toward training in the vernacular was recognized and definite plans were adopted for cooperation between the teachers of English and of history for maintaining the same stand ards in speech and writing in both classes At the close of the school year the question arose whether in view of the demands upon the curriculum too many hours were being devoted to this particular type of work It seemed clear that the work done in the English class had contributed enough to the history course so that we could well afford to drop one period a week from the latter After another years trial a second period was cut out The time thus saved has been utilized for a twohour course in science following the general science of the preceding year The plan of work now in force is briefly as follows The time set apart for Ancient History and English in a given year has been reduced from seven to five periods a week two of these five recita tions are conducted by the teacher of English three by the teacher of history all of the reading done in connection with the English work is made tributary to the course in history the use of correct English in speech and writing is as much a requirement for the history class as is a knowledge of certain historical facts In both classes a definite effort is made to develop the ability to read rapidly discriminatingly and thoughtfully The years work as a whole must satisfy the demands of both departments for the required work of the given year Since the organization of the school differs somewhat from that of the conventional fouryear high school it is desirable to make clear the program conditions under which this plan has developed and the scope of the English work in the course The school is organized on the basis of a sevenyear elementary and a fiveyear482 THE SCHOOL REVIEW upper school The first year of the upper school corresponds rather closely to the first year of a high school Pupils who have com pleted eight grades of the public schools enter this class and the years work includes among other subjects beginning Latin first year correlated mathematics and general science The modal age of the firstyear class in September 1916 was thirteen years A total of fifteen periods is given to English during the five years of the upper school They are distributed as follows first year four periods second yearthe year under discussiontwo periods third year three fourth year two fifth year four A brief statement of the English course in the first year will serve to indicate the point at which the secondyear work begins Ability to write legibly to spell correctly to use capitals and periods in their proper places is prerequisite to entrance to the upper school In the first year short oral or written themes are prepared weekly Attention is directed toward insuring the habitual use in speech and writing of correct and complete sentences The class is introduced to the use of the topical sentence in its relation to the paragraph and has some practice in making outlines The reading for this year includes three of Shakespeares plays three of Scotts novels selections from English and Scotch ballads and from Malorys Morte dArthur It is done primarily with a view to stimulating the pupils to read in rather large amounts and to read for pleasure Critical analysis of literature is not attempted until the third year As has been said it is in the second year that the courses in English and history are combined In this year the study of paragraphs and the making of outlines are continued Pupils are expected to acqufre a more flexible sentence structure to be able to use the necessary punctuation for such sentences and to make a conscious effort to increase their vocabulary The reading ior the year will be spoken of later The history course for this year covers the period usually included in a highschool course in ancient historynamely from earliest times to 800 AD Pupils who have entered from the lower school already have some familiarity with mythology and with classical names and places through the use of such books as Burts Odysseus Hardings Greek Gods Heroes and Men Bulfinchs AgeANCIENT HISTORY AND ENGLISH 483 of Fable and elementary texts dealing with the European back ground of American history Moreover for the summer following their first year in the upper school they are given a list of prescribed reading which includes A J Churchs Stories from Herodotus and Greek Life and Story and Lyttons Last Days of Pompeii No effort is made in their secondyear work to teach detailed political history or the minutiae of constitutional development but knowl edge of an outline of important events is considered necessary as a framework for the study of specific periods The objective point of the course is a knowledge of the life of mankind in its industrial commercial social and artistic aspects at various times and in different lands A consideration of the conflicts of nations with each other in the process of expansion and of their civil dissensions is not however wholly relegated to the background It would scarcely be possible today even if one wished to ignore the great conflicts of the past and one may according to her temperament emphasize the horrors of war or the ignominy of tame submission In all the work in history a constant effort is made to put in practice the principles of English in which the pupil has been trained by insisting that oral and written recitations be made in good form that complete sentences be used and that ideas be accu rately expressed The pupils are encouraged to make a conscious effort to enlarge their vocabularies by studying the meaning and derivation of new words and by making a point of using them The study of paragraph structure begun in the previous year is carried on both in reading and in writing Outlines are made sometimes in class sometimes as outside work Written work is corrected by the English teacher or by the history teacher or by both In any case it is corrected for both English form and historical accuracy As for the reading which is assigned to the secondyear English class the plan is that the first semester be spent on reading which pertains to Greek history the second on that which pertains to Roman In actual practice there is a tendency to devote more time to the Greek because of the greater interest of the Greek litera ture and because of the fact that few of the class will probably read any of it in the original The first two months are given to reading the Iliad Books ix xiii xiv xv and xvi being omitted A little484 THE SCHOOL REVIEW less time is needed for the Odyssey although only the first four books are omitted The translations of Lang Leaf and Myer and of Butcher and Lang are used For each lesson one or two books are assigned to be read outside of class The story of these books is told in class selected passages are discussed and sometimes read stories of mythology are reviewed and advance work is done by oral or by silent reading When the Iliad and the Odyssey have been completed several Greek plays are read The translations of Jebb Morshead and Murray are used as far as possible Those tragedies are selected which tell the stories of characters who have appeared in the Homeric poems This year the class read the three Aeschylean tragedies of the House of A treus the Philocteles of Sophocles and the Trojan Women Iphigenia in Aulis and Iphigenia in Tauris of Euripides The Antigone the Medea and the Bacchae although not connected with the characters of the Homeric poems were suggested and were read by many of the class The plays are assigned so that each girl reads at least six or seven Some read them all The recitation period during the reading of the plays is devoted to short talks about the different plays given by members of the class and to the informal discussions which such talks naturally arouse From books and pictures the class learns some thing about Greek and Roman theaters and modern reproductions such as those at Berkeley and Detroit The thoroughgoing classicist may think that to read Greek plays in translation is almost desecration while our friends who aspire to prepare the pupil for his lifes work without teaching him one superfluous thing will doubtless consider such reading a waste of time But in our three years trial the pupils have never failed to devour them with such avidity that the program seems justified if only from a hedonistic standpoint While the reading of these translations has been in progress several English poems in classical themes have been assigned for outside reading or have been read in class among them Tennysons Oenone Ulysses The Lotos Eaters and Tithonus Arnolds Palladium and Andrew Langs Helen of Troy If this seems like an overdose of classicism at leastANCIENT HISTORY AND ENGLISH 485 there is justification for it in the enthusiastic response from the pupils Throughout the reading of the epics the attention of the class is drawn continually to the passages which tell how the people of the Homeric Age lived and fought how they sacrificed and buried their dead what they wore what sort of houses they lived in and how they occupied their time The assignment of topics on these points gives material for themes and opportunity for an elementary study of sources The pupils are led to compare the manner of life at this period with what they have learned in their history of the life of the oriental nations and of the Greeks in the Aegean Age and in the great period of Greek history For securing material for comparison they use Baikies Sea Kings of Crete much of which has been assigned for outside reading in connection with the history class and such books as Davis A Day in Old Athens and Gulicks Life of the Ancient Greeks The reading for the second semester which is associated with the study of Roman history has varied somewhat from year to year Macaulays Lays of Ancient Rome are suggested as outside reading for while it must be admitted that they can be classified neither as literature nor as history they are stirring tales and it seems a pity not to have a speaking acquaintance with false Sextus and brave Horatius Shakespeares Julius Caesar is an obvious choice The class finds time in connection with its work in history to read A J Churchs Roman Life in the Days of Cicero together with selected passages from Suetonius Merivale Froude Oman Boissier Momsen and WardeFowler on the characters of Cicero Pompey and Caesar As one of the class exercises this year the pupils were asked to write a theme comparing the conception of Caesar which they gained from the play with that which they gained from the historians and then to add their own personal judgment about him Since more than half the class will read some portions from the works of Caesar Cicero and Vergil in their Latin course it is not thought desirable to give time to them here We tried Plutarchs Lives one year but the class objected to the English style in the only text available which contained the desired Lives so Plutarch was relegated by unanimous486 THE SCHOOL REVIEW consent to the optional list This year the class will read in the last six weeks of the term Tuckers Roman Life in the Days of Nero and St Paul This will be supplemented by Fowlers Roman Life in the Republic While reading these books the class will have the opportunity of comparing the life of republican and of imperial Rome and of recalling what they earlier learned about Greek life The reading of the class is not confined exclusively to books which have attained a position of dignity on the library shelves Articles in current papers and magazines which deal either with ancient times or with events now taking place in those regions which were included in the ancient world are occasionally assigned for outside reading or for class reports The Atlantic Monthly the Geographic Magazine Art and Archeology and the Outlook are among the magazines that have been made use of in this way The pupils take a lively interest in bringing to class clippings from newspapers or quotations from their other reading which contain allusions of any kind to the various matters which they are studying in class To those teachers in the background of whose consciousness always looms the specter of collegeentrance requirements the question will at once present itself whether such a course will meet these demands Will it count for one unit of history or one unit of English or threefifths of one and twofifths of the other  In the latter case what becomes of the required unit of history which the course in ancient history so often satisfies  Is the required ground actually covered For formal accounting it seems best under the present system of credits to count it as one unit of history and to let the English work of the other four years which amounts to twelve periods stand for the required three units of English At frequent intervals this year tests in history have been given similar to the tests given last year and the year before and there has been nothing to indicate that the class is less well pre pared to meet them than formerly Neither does it appear that the pupils are in any way handicapped in English It is permitted to hope that the time will come when instruction and practice in the correct use of the vernacular may be taken for granted legiti mately in connection with all school work and when the hoursANCIENT HISTORY AND ENGLISH 487 required to be devoted exclusively to the study of literary English may be shortened It has been stated that this work is at present divided between two teachers This has the advantage of making the pupil conscious that the two subjects are not isolated in watertight compartments There is something to be gained from having two instructors emphasizing the same things at the same time There is however no reason why it could not be done by one teacher provided she is generally intelligent and has not specialized so extensively that she is unable to see anything beyond her chosen subject It seems not too much to require that everyone who aspires to teach history be able to give instruction in English and have some literary appreciation and that every English teacher have sufficient historical background so that she can at least prepare herself to teach a course of this kind without any great hardship if the occasion arises A firsthand knowledge of Greek and Roman literature on the part of the teacher is obviously desirable If this is too much to hope for she should at least take the advice of competent judges in selecting for class use and for her own reading translations which have recognized literary merit and which have preserved in a large degree the classical spirit

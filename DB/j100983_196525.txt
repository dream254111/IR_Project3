PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY OF THE ANCIENT HOME OF MAN IN CENTRAL AND WESTERN ASIA BY THE REV OWEN STREET We are safe for the present in assuming that the race of man must have originally spread over the earth from a common centre We are equally safe in insisting that the indications of ethnography of language of existing monuments of the early migrations and of history point in a general way to Central and Western Asia Locate this original centre anywhere between the sources of the Euphrates on the west and the sources of the Oxus on the east and it falls within the sweep of the physical changes that are to occupy our attention We may look to the high tableland of Pamir called by the Asiatics  the roof of the world where so many have found the Mount of Paradise and the Ararat that received the ark the Aryaratha of the ancient Arians or we may take our departure from this Asiatic Olympus in the line of the first recorded migra tion t fromn the east into the land of Shinar and there we shall be in the vicinity where others have found the rivers that watered the garden of God or we may look northward to the sunny plains of Iran and find the home of Adam in the bright and fertile region where tradition has fixed the home of Zoroaster or we may find the favoured spot further east in Hyrcania or further west in Armenia and in either case the facts and reasonings now to be stubmitted will have their application We may speak of this whole region from the most eastern limit of the ancient Persian empire to the Mediterranean as in a general sense the early home of man and as the theatre of hiis early achievements There were the fields of enterprise and the fountains of history there was the home of a dominant energy that could rule the world  See a learned and analytical discussion

welcome a suin mons to something better or a resurrectionpower from abroad It is common I am aware to refer all this to the social moral and political forces that have been so long operating there It would be easy to show that these forces have been from a very early day intensely bad and corrupting in their influence over all that fielddemoralizing to the last degree and yet they did not for a long period of time avail to quell the aspirations of the people for intelligence or to keep down enterprise There were bred and traiined conquering armies that could march to the confines of Ethiopia and shatter the walls and monuments of the hundredgated Thebes that could subdue the cities of Asia Minor and penetrate beyond the Bosphorus and beyond the Danube far into the region from which Napoleon so many centuries after ward was compelled to withdraw the wreck of his legions and that could carry the easterni limit of the Persian dominion beyond that which Alexander was able to attain It is pertinent also to call to mind what we have been taught in regard to the early longevity We find hints of this outside of the Pentateuch In the laws of Menu where mention is mnade of the four ages of the world it is said that in these four successive ages the duration of humani life went on decreasing in the proportion of four three two one and Lenormant has pointed out four clearly defined eras of reduction in the Pentateuch which follow this pro portion very nearly First the average of 900 years attained by the earliest generations then the 600 years ascribed to Shem then the 430 to 460 years giving a mean of 445 years ascribed to his first three descendants then the 200 to 240 years assigned to the four succeeding generations giving a mean of 220 years after which the maximum falls away rapidly till it sinks to that which is still attained It will be seen that these numbers are quite near enough to the proportion of four three two one The Persians are said to have had a similar division of the ages aind you will of course recal the ages of gold silver brass and iron so familiar in classic literature  Contemporary Review Vol II No 3 note p 51 article The First Sin as Recorded in the Bible and in ancient Oriental Tradition by Franvois Lenormantcentral and Western Asia 195 This item the early longevity I do not propose to push to the front I introduce it and leave it with only the obviouis suggestion that for those with whom it is an accepted truith it will be all the easier to accept the conclusion to which the different lines of inves tigation we now undertake will converge viz that in the early ages of history the inhabitants of Central and Western Asia enjoyed a more salubrious climate than is found there at the present time I shall take no extreme positions A very few degrees of differ ence in the annuial average of the temperatuire in any country will change the whole face of nature there and revolutionize the habits of the people A recent French writer has estimated that so small a change as the deflecting of the Gulf Stream to the extent of four degrees of longitude away from the European coast would bring back the i3eperiod over France Let me recall to your knowledge as briefly as I may the present climate of the region we are contemplating I have collated from a large nuimber of authors all belonging to the present century a series of statements of which to save time I submit the following summary They tell us of a temperature during the summer months of 115 to 117 in the shade and from 130O to 1700 in the sun Men and animals flee from the direct rays  The following quotations will show something of the uniform tenor of these representations June 12 place about 80 miles north of Shiraz No object appeared to molest us except the almost insupportable sun and under it we continued to march three hours and a half across the mountains without a breath of air moving to cool our scorched skins or a drop of water to slake a thirst that was become intolerable The poor dogs overcome with drouth actually lay down again and again and howled in such apparent agony that I began to fear they would go madSir Robert Ker Porter  Travels Vol I p 483 The heat had now become so intense that my health began to suffer    In the trenches where I daily passed many hours the thermometer generally ranged from 112 to 115 in the shade and on one or two occasions even reached 117 The hot winds swept over the desert they were as blasts from a furnace during the day and even at night they drove away sleep I resolved

of longevity is from 10 to 15 years less than here The winters over large portions of this area are alike extreme in their severityt We consider next the question what reasons can be given for the opinion that this region was once favored with a better climate  We may cite first the general impression that such wiiters as Ilerodotus and Xenophon make upon us by their silence by the absence of positive statements like those of the modern writers to which I have referred They both had opportunity to observe and know for themselves It is especially strange that Xenophon who chronicles every inconvenience in the matter of supplies and the crossing of rivers and the faintheartedness or treachery of indi vidual men should have nowhere alluded to the oppressive heat We should certainly look for some such allusion in his account of the thirteen days march of the army of Cyrus in the month of August from Corsote to Pylae In this march he says many of the beasts of burden perished of hunger for there was nieither grass nor any sort of tree but the whole country was completely bare Yet not a word of any discomfort from the heat A single incident stands out with special significance in the

in St Petersburg One morning about the middle of the month the snow began to fall accom panied by a tremendous wind from the northeast and before evening the whole country was covered for several feet in depth    Owing to the long prevalence of frost the snow became like dust and when the wind llew it was whirled in clouds like the sand of the desert filling up every path hiighroad or hollow in its way This inconvenience is redoubled when the snow already down meets accumulation from above Hence it is considered great rashness to attempt going any distance from the city when either the heavens are loaded or the air is turbulent for to be caught in any of these snowstorms is almost certain destruction Many instances have occurred where not only solitary individuals but whole companies and

out to all whom he met both in Persian and Greek that the king was approaching with a vast army prepared as for battle The remarkable thing about this is not that the horse should be in a sweat but that Xenophon should have told us of it It would be a noteworthy thing now if a horse could be ridden there on the first day of September at a moderate pace and not be in a sweat The failure of Xenophon to speak of the hot dry climate in some such way as all modern writers speak of it may be placed side by side with Arrians account of Alexanders march through the desert of Gedrosia where the great heat does not fail to be distinctly recordedt The Greeks were no such salamanders as not to notice and speak of excessive heat when they encountered it We might compare what is said too of the delightful climate and fertility of Karmania the modein Kerman as Alexander found it on leaviing Gedrosia4 with the accounts that are now given of that country Or take Strabos  enthuisiastic description of the fertility and pro duietions of Hyrcania and compare it with what is found to be true at the present time when barely onetwentieth of the whole kingdom of Persia is under cultivation

too that travelers who have studied the history as well as observed the present condition of the land of Edom have remarked that there has been an entire change of the climate there In the days of Moses and even of the last of the Hebirew kings it had its fields and vineyards its flocks and herds its water for the iiihabitants and their cattle and its armies of thousands of men Now as Dr Thompson remarks it is the great and ever recuirring puzzle to discover by what means these vast flocks and herds could have been kept from perishing with thirst In the present condition of these lands he adds  it could not be done except during the rainy moinths of winter And Dr Payne Smitht remarks that  the Sinaitic peninsula was once a well wooded region To this day the trunks of palm

their statues The way is now open for us to deal directly with the changes in the physical geography of Asia that go far to account for this difference The whole breadth of Asia presents three zones the first or north ernmost of which is the Siberian and is drained into the Polar sea The second or middle zone is drained into inland lakes or deserts The third is drained into the Indian ocean I will preface my account of changes that are believed to have occurred with two or three that are regarded as historically certaini Trhe whole voice of antiquity without a dissenting word affirms that the Oxiis discharged itself into the Caspian sea whereas it   Ancient writers would lead us to suppose that in former times this cele brated river was navigable to a much higher reach than it is at present We can draw no other inference from the accounts given by some of them of the methods in use to convey goods from India to the Black sea Pliny particu larly describes the route Having arrived at Bactra modern Balk he ob serves the merchandize there descends the Icarus Jehon river as far as the Oxus and thence is carried down to the Caspian They then cross that sea to the mouth of the Cyrus the Kur where they ascend that river and on going on shore are transported by land for five days to the banks of the Phasis Rion wlhere they once more embark and are carried down to the Euxine Pliny

the antecedent literature of the world suggests that it may be a creation of the middle ages Humboldt came to the conclusion that in Alexaniders time it was a part of the Caspian sea Upon either theory or upon any theory that respects the uniform testimony of antiquiity we are compelled to admit a physical change here of the highest significance The River Volga which now empties into the Caspian made its way as late as the fifth century of the Christian era into the channel of the Don and contributed its waters to the Sea of Azof And the Persian gulf is found to recede by the filling in of sedi ment from the ShatelArab which receives the rivers of Mesopo tainia at the rate of nearly two miles in a century which carries the gulf back in 25 centuries some 50 miles and makes it certain that the rivers Tigris and Euphrates once entered it by their own distinct and separate channels Such changes as these account for some of the discrepancies and confusion of the early geo graphers and at the same time suggest that they inay not in all cases have been so far from the truth as has been supposed Pompey believed the Caspian sea to be a gulf setting in from the northern ocean And the conclusion that it once had such a con nection is now regarded as established beds since so important a traffi ck as that described could have been carried up their streams to such a height as would make the landcarriage from the one to the other only a journey of five days    From the present compara tively shallow state of these two rivers instead of goods being landed as of old time at a point in the Kur whence they might arrive at an answering navigable point on the Rion after a journey of only five days they would in our times be put on shore so low in the line of the river as to constrain them to traverse a distance of sixteen days travelling    Selencus Nicators project of connecting the Euxine and Caspian seas by a canal by a union of these two rivers could not have been conceived at all unless those rivers then possessed more extensive navigable channels that they do at presentSir Robert Ker Porter  Travels Vol I p 112 et seq It is selfevident that this higher level of the river Kur could not have existed without an equally elevated level of the Caspian   Von Baer has shown that the Caspian was connected with the ocean by way of the White sea and marks of erosion are now visible on racks at an altitude of 80 feet above the present water level These 80 feet correspondedCentral acnd Western Asia 203 We must admit too that Alexander was probably right in the opinion that he adopted after he had made diligent enquiry in Hyrcania that the Caspian sea took a broad sweep around the Caucasus range and became united with the Palus Macotis or Sea of Azof These sharp ambitious military men were pretty apt to get at the truth There is reason moreover to believe that the polar sea for a wide space east of the Ural mountains formerly ex tended its area down to the sixtieth degree of north latitude where it was in communication by means of another strait with the exactly with the present level of the ocean and it is a remarkable fact that no marks of erosion appear between that line and the present level of the waters This shows that the sinking of the waters by evaporation is a process too rapid to leave any records and took place after the severance of its connection with the White seaAm Journal of Science and Arts Nov 1873 p 396 In singular agreement with this Plutarch says in his Life of Alexander He could get no certain information in what manner it the Caspian sea was formed but he conjectured it came from an outlet of the Palus Macotis Yet the ancient naturalists were not ignorant of its origin for many years before Alexanders expedition they wrote that there are four seas that stretch from the mnain ocean into the continent the farthest north of which is the Hyrcanean or the Caspian Plutarchs Lives Langhornes translation p 477 smaller edition Of these gulfs there are four principal the northern called the Caspian by others designated as the Hyrcanean sea  the Persian and Arabian gulfs formed by the southern sea the one being nearly opposite to the Caspian and the other to the Euxine the fourth which in size is much more considerable than the others is called the Internal and Our sea   All these gulfs formed by the exterior sea have a narrow entrance those of the Arabian gulf however and the Pillars of Hercules are smaller than the rest Strabo Book II chap v sec 18 It should be noticed too how the ancient geographers speak of the territory that joins the region of the Caucasus to Armenia as an  isthmus Strabo says of the Caucasus  It is the territory between the Caspian sea and the Euxine bounded on one side by the Don the Exterior ocean and the Sea of Hyrcania on the other by the isthmus where it is narrowest from the recess of the Euxine to the Caspian Observe where he brings in the Exterior ocean viz between the Don and the Sea of Hyrcania   After Humboldts profound investigations in Central Asia we shall not at the present day show too great temerity in assuming that

and Africa was in commu nication with the great ocean The upheaval that excluded the ocean left the waters of this inland sea to their necessary accumu lation from the various rivers that were flowing

Eber the greatgrandson of Shern  Trhere were born unto him two sons and the name of the one was Peleg for in his days was the earth divided Some have referred this to the confusion of tongues but I may be permitted to point to the constant use of the Hebrew noun peleg and of the corresponding verb palag both of which occur in this pas sage  Peleg  means everywhere a channel or watercourse and scholars have found here the root of the Greek 7EAayo sea Following this suggestion which too many writers have hastily dismissed and anglicising a wellknown Greek verb for the occasion we might read the passage thus The name of the one was called Peleg for in his days was the earth pelagized or cut by the sea geological period  the Mediterranean the Black sea and the Caspian were all one body of water The old Paleozoic island was broken up by  a succession of local eruptions so as to form deep valleys in all directions The waters of the Black Sea having been ciit off from the Mediterranean by the formation of the Thracian peninsula rose and had to seek some outlet  They found their waY into one and another of these valleys until they reached the Marmora which was probably then a lake The rise in the Marmora cut through the channel of the Dardanelles  The only thing which makes the problem a difficult one is the existence of the great volcanic domain at the northern extremity of the straits The channel of the Bosphorus passes through this a distance of more than four miles How was this part of the channel formedthe very question that was asked more than 4000 years ago Job xxxviii 25  In the book of Job who is believed by many to have lived in the next generation after Peleg Gen x 29 we find the same verb with precisely this meaning and if the passage had been constructed with special reference to this event the words could not have been better chosen  Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of the waters Job xxxviii 25 The words here inclosed in brackets are all used to represent the simple verb   We might translate it  Who hath clianneled for the overflowing of waters The very passage that is appealed to in support of the moie ordinary inter pretation Ps lv

offending part being put after the manner of the Hebrew psalms for tlle whole as in Ps lii 4 Ps cxx 3 and Ps xxxi 20Central and TWestern Asia 207 Strabo tells us on the authority of Diodorus Siculus that the inhab itants of the island of Samothracia had a tradition of an inundation caused by the sudden rising of the waters of the Mediterranean which compelled the inhabitants to fly for refuge to the summits of the mouintains and long afterwards the fishermens nets used to be caught by the columns that prior to the catastrophe adorned their edifices  It is said he adds  that the inundation originated in a rupture of the chain of mountains which shut in the valley which has since become the Thracian Bosphorus He quotes Eratosthenes as saying of Strato that  he goes more deeply into the causes   and was of the opinion that for merly there was no exit for the Euxine as now at Byzantium but that the rivers flowing into it forced a way through and let the waters escape into the Propontis and thence into the Hellespont and that a like change occurred in the Mediterranean for that sea being overflowed opened a passage at the Pillars of Hercules This higher level of the Mediterranean left no alternative but to conclude that the African desert was also covered with water as It seems not to have been noticed by those who explain Gen x 25 by Gen xi 7 8 9 that they have nothing in common but the single word the earth while Gen xi 7 8 9 and Ps lv 9 which last is pro posed as the crucial test have not in the Hebrew so much as this in common The first king of the second

to Sept life of Peleg from 2714 B C to 2375 BC Giving 15 years in which the two were cotemporaneous The latter probably received his name before he was 15 years old This exactly meets the case  a fissure of the earth  We have in history the tale of many an earthquake and it is not unusual to find somewhere in the record an account of one or more fissures of the earth But where is there another example of this curt way of making the fissure tell the whole story As if the author wished it to be understood that the earthquake was in other respects like all earthquakes but in this case the unique thing without a parallel that which was alone worthy to go into history was the great  fissure of the earth If we were allowed to construct the history and fix the dates to suit ourselves we could not have coined a statement or determined upon figures that would have been more confirmatory of our interpretation208 Changes in the Physical Geography of Erastothenies maintained This writer tells us of fraginents of wrecks that had been found far inland and were said by the inhab itants of the oases to have come through some opening The discussions of the last few years have made us familiar with the fact that a part of the great African desertthe Saharais below the level of the ocean And we know how seriously the ques tion has been debated as to the expediency of opening a channel from some point in the great bay that protrudes into the continent from the Mediterranean southwesterly from the island of Sicily The testimony of ancient literature to the fact of the former ex istence of a great Asiatic Mediterranean which has for the most part disappeared is amply supported by modern discovery We point first to that great area of depression lying inorth of the Cas pian sea which is declared in McCullochs Geographical Dictionary to be  the most remarkable depressiont on the face of the globe We can at once duplicate the area of the Caspian sea with an area of depression here that gives a surface lower than the ocean level Of course it is lower than the Black sea Pierce the northeastern barrier of the Black sea and you would speedily convert all this area inito the bed of a sea again But this is not believed to be by any means the limit of this ancient Asiatic sea Lenormant says  it occupied the whole bed of the Caspian and the Sea of Aral covered a great part of the steppes situated between the Ural mountains anid the Volga as well as the country of the Kalmucks and reached southward to the base of the Caucasus Its eastern limits are uncertain

either that these eastern bodies of water were not continuous with the Hyrcanean sea but separate lakes or else that there has been a remarkable up lifting of this part of the continent Whichever alternative we take the argument as regards climate is the same Richtofen who has brought out for us important treasures of geo graphical knowledge from Chinese sources both ancient and modern and who affirms that the Chinese never put anything into their maps that has not a corresponding reality informs us that the Chinesc name for the desert of Gobi means  the dried up sea This gives us an additional stretch of sea eastward of some 1600 miles with a varying width of from 300 to 700 miles Its range of lati tude is almost identical with that of the Caspian sea This large body of water

include in the sweep of physical causes that doubtless operated within the human period I mean those nlilder conditions of climate in northeastern Siberia in which the trees a foot in diameter which are now washed out from the frozen soil by the river floods were growing there and vast herds of mam moths were roaming through the forests and finding ample suste nance there We must now accept the conclusion as fully sustained that maii was cotemporary with the mammoth And it is well known that tonis of ivory from tusks weighing in some instances 480 pounds each are annually brought into the markets of the world from Siberia and from the islands of New Siberia and Kotelnoi from 130 to 150 miles distant from the coast Indeed there are three dis tinct instances in which the complete carcasses of mammoths have been found disentombed from the soil by the summer freshets in such a state of preservation that the dogs ate their flesh Of course their destruction and burial and thorough refrigera tion must have been in connection with some terrible cataclysm that brought on an era of intense cold after it Some will find this revolution in connection with the Noachian deluge alnd some in connection with a later disturbance perhaps that in the days of Peleg or Deucalion At whatever point we place it it marks the climatic change with sufficient distinctness to call to mind that at onie time mans cotem porary the mammoth found a congenial home and abundant supplies where the average temperature of the entire year is now below the freezing point and in some localities very near to the zero point and where these trees cannot grow now even as stuilted shrubs At Yakutsk 620 north latitude the RussianAmerican company in desert was doubtless the bed of a sea in a recent

change We shall not be charged with extravagance if we distinctly put forth the claim that there was formerly and within the human period a milder climate at the Arctic circle and of course below it than now This alone would settle the point that there must have been a more even climatea climate of less extremesin the region of the old cradle of the human race It takes away the source of those cold boreal blasts that now render the winters of northern Persia so desolate Thus as we go back in time we travel away from those extremes which are so strongly marked in the climate of Central Asia extremes with which though in a far less degree we on the eastern side of this continent are unhappily familiar for as Humboldt has put it New York has the summer of Rome and the winter of Copenhagen and Quebec has the summer of Paris and the winter of St Petersburg and still worse on the eastern side of the Asiatic continent Pekin has in summer the scorching heats of Cairo in Egypt and winters as rigorous as those of Upsala in Sweden Let us put these things together A milder climate in eastern Siberia a vast gulf of the Arctic ocean east of the Ural mountains stretching down below the 60th

the Physical Geography of There is ample time especially if coming discoveries should favor the longer chronologies and the extending of the prehistoric era of mans existence for greater changes than have been now suggested There is no lack of time even if the shorter chronology more familiar to the popular mind be adopted We come now to contemplate those atmospheric laws and con ditions that enter into the question of climatic change It has been said that the cooling of air that has been saturated with moisture has the same effect as the squeezing of a sponge it being a wellknown law that its capacity for moisture increases as its temperature is raised but in a greatly enlarged ratio As the heated air from the south strikes the base of a mountain range it of course ascends the slope to the cooler regions above the pres sure of the current behind forces it up As it rises it parts with its moisture much more rapidly than with its heat In other words it becomes very dry The mountain range becomes a most potent condenser of the water that was held in invisible vapor and senids it down in torrents and rivers to the sea This effect is produced on a large scale by the Himalaya mountains It is also produced by the upward movement of the air iidependently of mountain bar riers Hence the air in the upper regions and especially in the upper Arctic regions descends upon the earth as a very dry air As it inoves toward the south and grows warmer it acquires an intense desiccating power It absorbs moisture and does not give it back to the earth This is especially true as regards the region now undei consideration It is part of  a rainless belt that incluides the whole of northern Africa except Tur1is anid Algeria the northern half of Arabia the most of Syria aiid almost the whole of Persiaa zone of an average breadth of 900 nmiles where rain is altogether absent or of rare occurrence With a nairrow interr uption where the Himalaya chain passes into the Ilindoo Koosh which includes Afghanistan and the Upper Punjab this zone is prolonged northeast through Thibet Upper Tartary and into Mongolia covering the desert of Gobi or Sharno It is tlhus broken into two great rainless districts the one of 3000000 and the other of 2000000 of square miles  Sir J F W Herschell in  Enc Brit eighth edition Vol XVII p 614 Most of this statement in regard to the trade winds is abbreviated from Sir J F W HCenttral tand Western Asia 213 In the great atmospheric movement from Siberia toward the sun when the latter is vertical over the burning plains of Hindoostan and Arabia and the Sahara we may observe that there is a wide sweep a belt of 1600 miles that passes over the desert of Gobi one of the most arid and desolate of all the illconditioned solitudes of the globe fully rivalling all the horrors of the Sahara in Africa  The trade winds as they are called that draw in from the north over this desert in the summer bring no rain On the contrary they are exceedingly dry and have a most intense evaporating power and in the winter the antitrade winds are cut off from affording any rain by the barrier of the Himalaya mountains Henice whatever transverse currents may come from these desert plains and terraces of central and eastern Asia can have no ameliorating effect uipon the great windcurrent that sweeps down across the Aralian and Caspian seas and the desert of Khiva This windcurrent is the potent instrumentality that is working out the deterioration we are contemplating Here we encounter in its incipiency that wind from the north that the Arabs call Shirmal and which so many writers declare to be more like the blast from a furnace than like any air that was made for man to breathea wind the worst quality of which we do not read from the scale of the thermometer We must take account of it in some such way as this It is a wind that drinks up all the water that is poured itito the inniumerable salt lakes and marshes that are not drained into the Arctic ocean and all the water that is poured into the Caspian sea and the Sea of Aral neither of them having any outlet the Caspian sea itself having an area of 180000 square milesan area exceeding that of the States of New York New Jersey Pennsylvaniia Mary land and Virginia with all New England except Maine thrown in a sea extending through nearly 10 degrees of latitude as far as from New York to Savannah and receiving by the rivers that pour into it the drainage of between 600000 and 700000 square miles of territory It is a wind that drinks up all the water that is poured itito the Caspian by the Kuma the Terek the Aras the Kur the Sefid the Attruk the Ural and the Volgathe Volga alone receiv ing in its course of 2000 miles the influx of 37 navigable and 153 unnavigable tributaries and all that is poured into the Aral by the Oxus and the Jaxartes and yet it grows more thirsty as it sweeps214 Chanzges in tlhe Physical Geography of on drinking up all the water that is poured into the Mediterranean from the Nile from the watersheds of Northern Africa Spain France Italy Greece Asia Minor and Syria all that comes from the Black sea and as it is estimated more than twothirds of that which is poured in from the Atlantic through the Straits of Gibraltar And still these winds are not satiated they sweep on across the Sahara to the Atlantic sparing no rain for earth or ocean till they approach the equator and pass by an upward movement to the higher regions of the air The Caspian sea with all its revenue of waters from its many tributaries is said to be steadily diminishing or in other words drying up and it is quite obvious that the process is adequate to account for the disappearance of that great inland sea which still remained after the openiing of the Bosphorus Given these thirsty tradewinds with no adequate compensations aind it must be only a quiestion of time whether Central Asia should become a desert Let us now reconstruct the map of Asia in the light of what the most eminent physicists have taught us let us bring down the Arctic ocean over Western Siberia to the parallel of 60 N lat itude let us fill the great basin north of the Caucasis restore the whole vast Asiatic Mediterranean stretching away to the confines of China and then let us make the final addition of the great African Mediterraniean that skirted the base of the Atlas Mountainsand I need not stop to point out at length the elements of salubrity and physical comfort and strength and longevity which almost inevitably come with the change There would be the difference which there is between the air that comes from the sea and that which comes from a vast surface of land there would be the regulating and equalizing influence of great bodies of water there would be the more ample resouirces of moisture for the air and the consequent dew and rain there would be the salubrity of the sea over vast surfaces where there are now miasms and other unwholesome infltuences of marshes and decaying vegetation In short there would be something of the change which there is in passing from a climate of extrernes to one where the range of temperature falls within moderate limits There would be an approach toward what is called an insuilar climate such as is now enjoyed by a large portion of Europe The differen Ie may be made intelligible by a comparison of Greenland with Lapland the former being colder in latitude 600 than the lattereh tral anct Y estern Asia 215 in latitude 720 and that for the reason that Greenland at 600 N latitude has an immense stretch of frozen territory spreading away toward the north while Lapland borders on a vast surface of water instead To prevent confusion it should be remarked that the argument adjusts itself to a sliding scale of climatic changes but seems to requiire a recognition of two distinct stages which we may designate as the prehistoric and the historic stages In the former we see the climatic factors operating with their most benignant effect an immense surface of water to windward and an atmosphere vastly nearer to the point of saturation with aqueous vapor a close approximation to an insular climate In the latter a diminished and diminishing water area though greatly in excess of what now exists and a corresponding advance in the heat and dryness of the atmosphere Less water surface and a mnore thirsty air yet far enough from the present condition of things to admit of the Mesopotamia the Persia and the ldumea of twentyfive centuries ago Any one who has read what the best observers and the highest scientific authorities have said of the uncertainty of all a priori con clusions drawn from the power of the discovered forces and ingre dients of the atmosphere in any given locality unless sustained by admitted results will at once appreciate the method and strength of an argument that takes in welldefined results on a scale that is more than national and covers a range of a hundred generations With this test of unquestioned history in mind let me say a final word upon the proved tendency of an insular climate in the tem perate latitudes to produce an aspiring and dominant race of men Such was the climate of Greece at the very time that Central Asia was beginning to succumb to the deteriorating process I have described And there was no power to execute the menace of Xerxes in the millions of his armed host no power to conquer the ten thousand led by Clearchus and Xenophon no power to turn back the hardy troops of Alexander After the days of Darius the father of Xerxes the armies of Asia found a Marathon or a Plataea wherever they encountered the Greeks And where shall we look for the center and home of the domin ant forces of our own day  Where dwell the people that have216 Chacnges in the Physical Geography c carved out an empire of hundreds of millions of souls from the con tinent of Asia and are successfully ruling the very realm from which Alexander was compelled to turn away Where dwell the people who have grasped the great Australian empire and rule through all the southerin seas  Where dwell the people that hesitated not to move up their fleets toward Constantinople two years ago and say to the conquering Russians  Hitherto bitt no further the power that is ready any day to take the troublesome Turk off from the hands of Europe and govern him for the benefit of the world  Where dwell the people that come nearest to dominating the whole eastern world and through their descendants are dominating this western world  The answer carries us to that narrow insular realm of less area than the single State of Missoutri or if we take in Scotland and Ireland of less area than the two States of Missouri and Illinois and less than half the dimensions of Texas There is certainly something in that insular climatesomethiing in that atmosphere which so obviously derives its peculiarity more from the water than the landthat imparts a special toughness to the fibre of character and a wonderf tl power of endurance and con trol We have approached something like this as we have travelled back along the line of the geographical and historical ehanges in the heart of Asia This discussion raises many questions of course which we have had no time to consider But it may be modestly hoped that it points in the direction where the key is to be found The lines of history have not runi independently of the changes that have written themselves on the face of the Asiatic continent and made themselves felt in its atmosphere On the conclusion of the foregoing paper a vote of thanks to the Speaker having been moved by Hon Edwards Pierrepont a class mate of the Speaker in Yale College of the class of 1837 and

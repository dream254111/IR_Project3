j100358,The School Review,1078384,Using HomeMade Tests in High Schools,i244747,USING HOMEMADE TESTS IN HIGH SCHOOLS LEE BYRNE University of Iowa Formerly Supervisor of HighSchool Instruction Dallas Texas This paper indicates briefly the ways in which some homemade tests have recently been employed in the high schools of Dallas Texas These are not published standardized tests but sets of questions prepared by the supervisor in the central office and based directly on the content of the local course of study The tests were not directed exclusively toward any one object Rather it was the intention to secure some representative material from the different classes of the same grade in the various high schools and to examine this material with a view to ascertaining by interpretation whatever lessons it might prove to contain The different procedures employed and the kinds of inferences drawn are shown in the following pages To the outside reader the most fruitful procedure will probably be the analyzing of the subjectmatter into its subdivisions and the discrimination between the quality of results attained in the several subdivisions or phases of each subject In every case it was revealed that notably higher results were attained in some aspects of the work than in others In one instance it was discovered that an important phase of the subject was practically untaught graphs in algebra Such results pointed to the desirability of changes in school practice some of which have already been carried out to good advantage THIRDSEMESTER ALGEBRA A general test was given to the twentythree classes in third semester algebra when they were about halfway through the term and toward the end of the term they were given a second test on new topics Each paper received a simple mark and the marks were tabu lated These marks whose positions were rather accidental de 536USING HOMEMADE TESTS IN HIGH SCHOOLS 537 pending on the difficulty of the test and the method of marking were then translated to a standardized or Dallas scale based on the probability curve and the assumption of 70 as the mark separating passing from failing with a range of passing marks from minus i sigma to plus 2 sigma in the distribution In other words the upper fourfifths of the curve was assigned to passing marks and the lower fifth to failing marks The relative position of each class teacher and school as well as the city average was indicated on each scale The averages in the two tests on a standardized scale were compared item by item with the teachers marks for the first and second halves of the term and for the whole term This was done by both tabulation and graphic drawing leading to the inference that certain individual teachers were marking too high or too low as the case might be The Spearman correlation between the first and second tests was 48 between first halfterm mark and second halfterm mark 62 between term mark and the average of the two halfterms 8i between term mark and the average of the two tests 55 between average of the two halfterms and average of the two tests 51 A fair degree of reliability is thus indicated for all of the marks The distribution of correct answers was ascertained for each test showing the number of pupils securing 8 7 6 5 etc correct answers In a sixanswer test the median was 5 and in an eight answer test it was 7 The percentages of wrong answers by topics in both tests were Factoring  i3 Difference of squares  147 Trinomial square   103 x2 ax b 143 Fractions  28 o Addition  622 Multiplcation   266 Division

The addition question was a little too long Inferences were drawn as to the relative difficulty of the different topics Regard ing factoring and literal equations conclusions were reached in harmony with the recommendations of the National Committee on Mathematical Requirements FOURTHSEMESTER ALGEBRA A general test was given to the seventeen classes in the last semester of algebra taught The simple averages for all classes and schools were computed tabulated and ranked The average marks by topics in fourthsemester algebra were as follows Solving quadratics  863 Simplifying radicals  512 Problem involving quadratics Equation correctly formed  157 Complete solution  103 Drawing graph  155 Finding square root  672 The test was too long so that only limited conclusions could be drawn regarding the later questions but practically all of the pupils had time to finish the questions on quadratics and on radicals The average for solving quadratic equations appeared very high and was the result of extensive practice The understanding and manipulation of powers and roots represent a rather advanced type of mathematical thinking As 50 per cent success is not of much value the results in radicals seemed to indicate the desirability of limiting the amount of ground covered in the field of radicals and exponents and increasing the practice in the more restricted field until greater precision is secured This is in harmony with the recommendations of the Commission on the Reorganization of Secondary Education2 and the National Committee on Mathematical Requirements3 I The

was rather difficult in fact it is hard to find problems involving quadratics which are not difficult One might add that real problems are rare While simple equations are applicable to numerous situations in everyday life quadratic equations have few practical applications Only I5 per cent of the pupils had sufficient insight into the problem to form a correct equation and only io per cent reached a final solution Of course these percentages would have been somewhat higher if all of the pupils had reached this problem Nevertheless the meager results in the use of quadratic equations together with the fact that any real uses of them are hard to find seemed to throw doubt on the justification of spending such an extensive amount of highschool time on quadratics as at present The question on graphs revealed the fact that though graphs are theoretically a part of our course of study the teachers are not in general teaching them The advanced text adopted by the state is out of date and practice in making graphs enters in only on the initiative of the teacher The result is that up to this time we have not been doing justice to this very practical and important phase of the subject Graphic treatment and interpretation should be prominent throughout the algebra course Over twothirds of the pupils produced correct results in extract ing square root which is a good record when we take into account the fact that not all of them had time to reach this question The performance on separate topics was also tabulated for the separate schools and the separate classes showing just which teachers were teaching graphs and the high and low performances of each class and on each topic One rough measure of a pupils ability may be found in the average of the marks which he receives in all of his subjects These averages were found and brought into comparison with the averages on the test The ratio of test average to the ability index was com puted and this ratio then formed what McCall would designate as an accomplishment quotient that is the amount of accomplish ment in proportion to ability Classes were then ranked both I W A McCall How to Measure in Education pp 8587 New York Macmillan Co 1922540 THE SCHOOL REVIEW Septembcr ways by their simple performances and by their accomplish ments in proportion to ability It was found that eleven classes remained unchanged in rank four were displaced one rank two were displaced two ranks and the average displacement was only onehalf of a rank That is it made no appreciable difference in appraising these classes whether we used an accomplishment ratio or the simple performance mark The question was asked in another form whether the ranks the classes attained on the test merely reproduced their ability ranks or whether due to teaching the test ranks proved to be different from the ability ranks It appeared that the classes by no means arranged themselves in test ranks in the order that would be expected from their ability indexes Only one class had the same rank in both the others varying from one to ten places with an average discrepancy of 44 places The test results were compared in detail with the teachers final examination marks and with the term marks Inferences were drawn as to variations among teachers with regard to the difficulty of their final examinations and the extent to which the teachers were too high or too low in general marking LAST SEMESTER OF PLANE GEOMETRY A test was given to the ten classes completing plane geometry The usual instruction in geometry and the usual testing consist largely of reproducing demonstrations which are printed in the text book In this test all questions were in the nature of originals or applications of principles learned For this reason the test was very much harder than an ordinary test it was given in this form to ascertain the amount of ability being developed to deal with original situations and to make applications of principles learned The test proved to be too long for the single period in which it was given The test proper consisted of three questions The first required the demonstration or proof of a theorem The second required a geometrical construction The third involved the practical application of a known principle A fourth a problem in computa tion was added for any who might be able to do more in the time allowed than the regular test called for1922 USING HOMEMADE TESTS IN HIGH SCHOOLS 541 The general distribution of marks and the averages for the separate classes and schools were worked out It was found that the amount of ability being developed by pupils in this subject varied greatly Marks on different phases of work were computed for each class and school and for the city The city averages on the differ ent phases of the work follow It should be borne in mind that pupils who did not reach a given question were scored as zero I Demonstration of original theorem  613 2 Problem in construction  355 3 Application of principle  388 4 Application involving computation  8o Only a very few reached the fourth question The best score was made on the demonstration of a theorem and this was the type of work on which they had had the most practice How much higher they would have averaged on the demonstration of a book theorem instead of an original was not determined by this test There was some ability to proceed independently with theorems similar to those in the book but this ability was not as highly developed as is desirable There was less power to deal with problems of construction than with the demonstration of theorems The ability to apply principles already learned wag poor For this the classroom teachers cannot be held wholly responsible as the number of book theorems now required to be taught is too large Apparently the number of book theorems to be learned should be reduced in order to secure more time for practice in applications This statement is in harmony with the report of the National Committee on Mathematical Requirements Test averages and the pupils ability were compared as in the case of the more advanced algebra test In this instance for ten classes the test ranks differed from the ability ranks by an average of 22 places The chance difference would be an average of 46 places Consequently we have here indicated clear connection between the two though by no means complete agreement The Reorganization of Mathematics in Secondary Education chap vi Bureau of Education Bulletin No 32 1921542 THE SCHOOL REVIEW September The papers of this test were first marked by the several teachers in accordance with general directions later they were marked by the supervisor in a somewhat simpler manner The average for the city according to the supervisors marks was within three tenths of I per cent of the average according to the teachers marks With the supervisors average mark as a uniform standard it was then ascertained how much too high or too low each teacher and school appeared to mark FIRSTSEMESTER LATIN Ten classes in beginning Latin took a test on the forms of the language studied up to that time The simple averages and averages on a standardized scale were computed for each class and the general distribution of the pupils marks was ascertained The percentage of errors was calculated for every separate form given in the test The percentage of wrong forms in the second declension was 7 in third declension consonant stems 13 and in third declension istems 16 the average being 12 In the verb forms 26 per cent were wrong in the first conjuga tion and 31 per cent in the second or an average of 29 per cent wrong in all of the conjugation work given From these figures it was evident that the proportion of error on verb forms is very much higher than on nouns the amount of error being nearly 30 per cent on verbs and only 12 per cent on nouns In view of this and taking into account the fact that there are only fifty or sixty standard noun forms while the standard verb forms number six or seven hundred it was inferred that it would be wise to memorize only onethird of the verb forms in the first year namely those of the third person especially as the other persons are not used in the text of Caesar and there is no need of employing them in reading until Cicero is reached in the third year It seemed that a pupil with thorough mastery of the third person would be able to acquire the first and second persons readily when he came to study Cicero Since this policy has been adopted the teachers report improved grasp of inflections in the first year1922 USING HOMEMADE TESTS IN HIGH SCHOOLS 543 SIXTHSEMESTER LATIN A test was given to the three classes just completing their third year of Latin this is the point at which they are doing their last highschool reading in Latin prose literature the next year being devoted to Latin poetry It was desired to ascertain how much power to read Latin prose literature is being developed in the highschool course In the time allowed most of the pupils were able to answer only the first three questions of which the first was a passage for translation the second a series of questions designed to test the extent to which the pupil understood the significance of what he was reading and the third required an exact statement of the inflectional forms of certain words The passage for translation was somewhat overdifficult The questions on the significance of what was read were very searching A few pupils had time to write answers to four other questions one on syntax one on derivatives and two dealing with the relation of Latin to English The averages made on the separate questions by those pupils who had time to answer them each average being expressed on a ioopoint scale are shown in Table I TABLE I Class I Class 2 Class 3 All Classes I Translation  526 340o 683 552 2 Understanding and knowledge 480 567 520 520 3 Inflections  440

passage selected for translation had been read in the early part of the term A more recent selection was not taken because the different schools were not reading exactly the same things at the end of the term this not being required by the course of study All had read though some time previously the oration from which the selection544 THE SCHOOL REVIEW September was taken Marking was rigidly mathematical giving credit for just such fractions of the whole as were right It might seem when a careful marking showed the three schools reaching only 68 per cent 53 per cent and 34 per cent correct translation or an average for the city of 55 per cent that not much is being accomplished in Latin But this depends somewhat on the criterion of judgment We must remember that in mathe matics science etc it is theoretically possible to select and adapt the curriculum material to the degree of maturity of the pupils In Latin however we do not bring the pupil in contact with Latin text especially prepared for him and exactly suited to his degree of maturity Instead the fundamental theory in Latin requires that we shall use real Latin text written two thousand years ago for people whose native tongue was Latin Cicero is used not because the text is easy but primarily because Cicero was the greatest Latin writer Even if a similar test should be given in a modern foreign language which in many ways would be much easier we should be disappointed if we expected a rigid marking to show any close approach to ioo per cent efficiency and accuracy That no such high scores can be expected or attained in Latin classes as ordinarily conducted can be seen by reference to a study by H A Brown of the Latin students in fifteen high schools in New Hampshire Brown made the most extensive study of the results of Latin instruction in high schools which has yet been attempted though it will be surpassed by the investigations now projected by the Classical League One of Browns tests was in the translation of connected Latin The Brown test differed from the Dallas test in the fact that in the former the passage was sight reading while in the latter the passage had been read a couple of months previous to the test On the other hand the Brown test used a passage from Caesar which was distinctly easier than the Cicero passage The marking in the two cases was comparable though not exactly the same In comprehension of meaning as shown by translation the thirdyear pupils of the fifteen high I H A Brown A Study of Ability in Latin in Secondary Schools chap vi Osh kosh Wisconsin State Normal School I9191922 USING HOMEMADE TESTS IN HIGH SCHOOLS 545 schools in New Hampshire with the largest enrolments ranged from 21 per cent to 68 per cent and averaged 45 per cent as compared with a range of from 34 per cent to 68 per cent and an average of 55 per cent for the city of Dallas So far as we can judge the results here are substantially similar to those in the larger high schools of New Hampshire Other aspectsThe second question was intended independently of translation to test the pupils understanding and knowledge of the situation involved in the passage read The scores here would have been higher if the class reading had occurred more recently The marks indicated that the pupils success in grasping the his torical setting and situation was just about the same as their success in translation though the separate classes varied The marks on the inflections question seem very low but this is mainly due to incompleteness rather than error Errors were not very numerous but the pupils often failed to make a complete statement of all of the details implied in the form of the question The answers were marked rigidly on the basis of com pleteness of statement The syntax question was marked with reference to grasp of the essential idea rather than completeness of statement and the scores were somewhat higher than for inflections The questions on English derivatives and on the relation of Latin to English were easy and the scores relatively high There was no indication that the relation of Latin to English was being neglected the lowest scores being in those questions dealing essentially with the Latin itself One of the problems to be considered by the Classical League in its investigation is whether the traditional objective of power to translate classical Latin shall remain the central objective or whether it shall be abandoned in favor of some objective which takes more account of the degree of maturity of the pupils and the probable brevity of their Latin course Results such as those from this test have bearing on the question Comparisons were also made of the test marks with the teachers final examination and term marks and with ability indexes formed by computing each pupils average in all subjects The class546 THE SCHOOL REVIEW making the lowest score on the test was also lowest in ability The ranking in test performance was the same as the ranking in  accom plishment in terms of ability that is the ratio of test performance to ability index SECONDSEMESTER HISTORY A test was given to twenty secondsemester classes studying medieval history Simple averages and averages on a standardized scale were worked out and compared with the teachers marks The test consisted of information questions of fact or

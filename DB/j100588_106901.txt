NEVIT MASKELYNEIDD FRS AXD ASTRONO MER ROYA READ MAY 1S 1794 1 DR HALLEYS METHOD OF COMPUTING THE RATIO BF THE DIA METER OF THE CIRCLE TO ITS CIRCUMFERENCE WAS CONSIDERED BY HIM SELF AND OTHER LEARNED MATHEMATICIANS AS THE EASIEST THE PRO BLEM ADMITS OF AND ALTHOUGH IN THE COURSE OF A CENTURYY MUCH EASIER METHODS HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED STILL A CELEBRATED MATHEMATICIAN OF OUR OWN TIMES HAS EXPRESSED AN OPINION THAT NO OTHER ALIQUOT PART OF THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF A CIRCLE CAN BE SO EASILY COMPUTED BY MEANS OF ITS TANGENT AS THAT WHICH WAS CHOSEN LY DR HALLEY RRIZ THE ARCLL OF 3O DEGREES THIS OPINION WHETHER IT BE JUST OR NOT I SHALL RLOT NOW INQUIRE MY PRESENT DESIGN BEING TO SHOW HONV THE SERIES BY WHICH DR HALLLY COMPUTED THE RATIO OF THE DIAMETER TO THE CIR CUMFERENCE OF THE CIRCLE MAY BE TRANSFORMED INTO OTHERS OF SWIFTER CONVERGELLCY AND WHICH ON ACCOUNT OF THE SUCCESSIVE POWERS OF IIO WHICH OCCUR IN THEM ADMIT OF AN EASY SUMMA TION 2 THIS TRANSFORMATIORL IS OBTAINED BY LNEANS OF

dutyApplication by private person A private person may apply for a mandamus to enforce a public duty not due to the government as such without the intervention of a law officer of the government And in the case at bar the petition is sufficiently full to entitle the petitioner to the writ 3 MANDAMUSOther adequate remedy The adequate remedy which will bar mandamus must be such as reaches the end intended and actually compels the performance of the duty in question It must be equally as convenient beneficial and effective as the proceeding by mandamus The remedy by repeated actions at law to recover damages for a constantly recurring and continued violation of duty is not adequate 4 MANDAMUsPersonal rightsContractual dutiesPublic and official duties Mandamus does not lie to enforce merely private or personal rights or contractual duties Its proper function is to enforce duties growing out of public relations or imposed by statute or in some respect involving a trust or official duty 5 CORPORATIONSCorporate dutiesMandamusCase at bar If an act of in corporation merely confers vitality and corporate existence on a corporation and the terms and conditions on which it is to exercise its

of a statute by implication is not favored and the presumption is always against the intention to repeal where express terms are not used or the late statute does not amend the former Usually the two statutes must be irreconcilable to justify the presumption of an intention to repeal one by the other But where the later statute embraces the whole sub ject of the former and is plainly substituted for it the former will be deemed to be repealed 2 OYSTERSDredging Dredging on private oyster grounds is not a criminal offence and has not been since March 3 1898 JONES V MORRISDecided at Richmond March 30 1899Keith P 1 CRIMINAL LAWIrregularities in warrantWaiverTwice in jeopardy An accused may waive irregularities in the warrant for his arrest and where he has done so and the justice has jurisdiction of his person and of the offence with which he is charged and heals the charge on its merits the judgment of the jus tice is final and conclusive and the guilt or innocence of the accused of that charge can never again be called in question 2 CRIMINAL LAWLarceny Warrant Feloniously Acquittal The omis sion of the word  feloniously from a warrant charging an accused with larceny will not vitiate a judgment of acquittal No objection having been taken to the omission and the charge having been fully investigated the judgment of acquittal is a complete bar to any further prosecution for the same offence 3 INSTRUCTIONSEvidence to support Any evidence tending to prove a fact is sufficient to justify the court in giving an instruction applicable to it if requested so to do even though the evidence be so slight as to be insufficient to support a verdict founded on it 4 GOOD CHARACTERPresumption As it is the duty of the owner of a tug boat to place a man of good character in the position of captain of the boat it is to be presumed in the absence of evidence to the contrary that he exercised that care and discretion which the law imposed upon him as a duty 255

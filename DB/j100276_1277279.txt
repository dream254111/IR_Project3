contrary to the due process clause N Y C R R Co v White 243 U S I88 Where there has been no provision in the act authorizing an award for disfigurement the injured employee has been allowed to recover damages in an action at law Boyer v Crescent Paper Box Co 143 La 368 loss of scalp Shinnick v Clover Farms Co 169 N Y App Div 236 part of ear bitten off by horse Under statutes containing disfigurement clauses separate awards are allowed for disability and disfigurement Stevenson v Illinois Watch Co I86 Ill App 418 In Great Britain the phrase incapacity to work in the statute is con strued to include disfigurement Ball v Hunt  Sons Ltd 1912 A C 496 The court said The recent accident loss of an eye already blind has de stroyed his market though it has left his physical ability to work what it was before Lord Atkinson in Ball v Hunt  Sons Ltd supra This reasoning coincides with the argument of the court in the principal case i e that it would be of little avail to the injured workman that he was as skillful after the accident as before if the result of his disfigurement was to prevent his obtaining or keeping his employment For discussion of general ques tion involved see

pamphlets calling upon workers in ammunition factories to strike to unite for action to keep the armies of the allied countries busy at home They were indicted under the Espionage Act Sec 3 Title I Act of June 15 1917 amended May I6 1918 on counts among others of conspiracy to encourage resistance to the United States in the war with Germany and to incite curtailment of pro duction of things necessary to the prosecution of that war Held there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict of guilty Abrams v United States 40 Sup Ct Rep 17 The expressed purpose of the pamphlets was to create opposition to and interference with the fighting against Soviet Russia not to encourage nor assist German militarism Production of ammunition was decried not be cause it was used against Germany but because it was used against Russia as well Mr Justice Holmes with whom concurred Mr Justice Brandeis dissented from the majority holding on the proposition that the defendants had not the specific intent required by the statute The natural effect of the pamphlets he agreed would be to curtail production of things necessary to the war with Germany and perhaps to cause resistance to that war and the defendants might be presumed to know that such would be the result He further agreed that ordinarily such knowledge of the natural conse quences would be construed as a sufficient intent to produce them whatever might be the primary motive But he contended this effect on the war with Germany was not the motivating idea of the defendants it was not their primary intentionthat being only to weaken the allied ability to fight against Russia This might be disputed but as the majority opinion nowhere contra 236RECENT IMPORTANT DECISIONS dicts it but carefully refers only to our War plans in Europe it may be inferred that the court was agreed on that point The disagreement is as to the intent required by the statute The minority opinion asserts that it re quired a primary and motivating intent to affect the war with Germany the majority assumed that only a subordinate or constructive intent to accom plish that end was required Debs v U S 39 Sup Ct Rep 252 in which Justice Holmes himself delivered the convincing opinion is perhaps dis tinguishable on the ground that while Debs purpose to obstruct the draft was but incidental to his object of eliminating all war yet it was a deliberately intended effect rather than a mere recognized consequence No authority is cited for either opinion and as the issue is one of legislative intent it is obvious that precedent would not be pertinent An analogy however to the dissenting conclusion is found in Rex v Williams I Leach 529 There the defendant was indicted under a statute prohibiting the cutting defacing etc of wearingapparel The evidence showed that the defendant had intended primarily to wound the person of the wearer although he must have known that in so doing he would cut the clothing of the person The court held in view of the particular circumstances under which the statute was passed that a primary intent to deface the clothing was requisite and dismissed the in dictment Somewhat analogous also are People v Cotteral i8 Johns N Y II5 and Delaney v State 41 Tex 6oi On the other hand in Reg v Pem bliton 12 Cox C C 607 a statute was interpreted as dictum not to require a primary intent to do the particular wrong prohibited It is well known that some statutes as interpreted by the courts require no specific intent to break the law at all Corn v Boynton 2 Allen Mass I6o Harper v State 91 Ark 422 Under the interpretation given the statute by the majority those who incited the present coal strike would be liable to 20 years imprisonment were we still prosecuting the war with Germany DAMAGESMEDICAL EXPENSSFUNERAL EXPENSESIn an action by an administrator suing for the death of the intestate caused by the wrongful act of the defendant it was held that he may recover the medical expenses neces sitated by the injuries but he cannot recover the funeral expenses the loss to the estate by reason of that expenditure having been prematurely forced on it being the true measure Df damages Brady v Haw Ia I919 174 N W 331 The question whether medical and funeral expenses may be recovered by an administrator suing under the Death Act has often come before the courts and the cases are not in harmony on this point Since the damages are based solely on the loss due to the death it would seem to follow on principle that medical expenses being caused not by the death but by the injury should not be recoverable under the Death Act Boulter v Webster II L T Rep N S 598 It has frequently been held in this country however that re covery may be had for medical expenses in actions by a parent as adminis trator for the death of a minor child Rains v St Louis Railway 71 Mo 164 As to funeral expenses the courts are divided depending on the courts interpretation of the damage clause of the Death Act The question seems 237

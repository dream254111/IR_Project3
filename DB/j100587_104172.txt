PAGE 218 OF THIS TRANSACTION ,I206907,227 V PART OF A LETTER FROM  OF CAM BRIDGE TO A FRIEND OF THE R O Y A L S O C I E T Y OCCASIONED BY WHAT HAS LATELY BEEN REPORTED CONCERNING THE INSECT MENTIONED IN PAGE 218 OF THIS TRANSACTION NOV 20 1742 THE LAST NEWS FROM PARIS GIVES SOMETHING VERY SURPRISING IN THE ACCOUNT OF MONSIEUR REAUMURS LATE MEMOIR READ IN THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES THERE CONCERNING AN ANIMAL CALLED A POLYPUS IN WHICH LIFE IS SAID TO BE PRESERVED AFTER IT HAS BEEN CUT INTO SEVERAL PIECES SO THAT ONE ANIMAL SEEMS BY SECTION TO BE IMMEDIATELY DIVIDED INTO TWO OR THREE MORE COMPLETE ANIMALS EACH SEPARATELY ENJOYING LIFE AND CONTINUING TO PER FORM THE PROPER OFFICES OF ITS SPECIES READ NOV 25 1742 SUCH AN ACCOUNT WOULD HAVE BEEN LESS REGARDED HAD WE NOT BEEN INFORMED BEFORE THAT TWO  LETTERS HAD BEEN COMMUNICATED TO THE R O Y A L S O C I E T Y SOME MONTHS SINCE FROM GOOD HANDS BOTH WHICH MEN TIONED THE SAME THING AND RELATED IT AS A FACT AVERRED AND CAREFULLY EXAMINED BY ONE OF THE GREATEST JUDGES AND MOST INDEFATIGABLE PROMOTERS OF NATURAL HISTORY AND ESPECIALLY OF THAT PART OF IT WHICH LEADS TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT IS MOST PARTICULAR AND REMARKABLE IN THE INSECT AND REPTILE PART OF THE CREATION SOME OF OUR FRIENDS WHO ARE FIRMLY ATTACHED TO THE GENERAL METAPHYSICAL NOTIONS WE HAVE FOR MERLY LEARNED REASON STRONGLY AGAINST THE VERY POSSIBILITY OF SUCH A FACT BUT AS I HAVE MYSELF FOR  SEE ABOVE P 219 AND 220 G G 2 MERLY228 MERLY OWNED TO YOU ON OTHER OCCASIONS MY DISTRUST OF THE TRUTH OR CERTAINTY AT LEAST OF SOME OF THOSE PRINCIPLES WHICH I NEVER YET HAD A SUFFICIENT UNDER STANDING OF TO GIVE A FULL AND CLEAR ASSENT TO I SHALL NOW MAKE NO SCRUPLE OF ACKNOWLEDGING THAT I HAVE ALREADY SEEN SO MANY STRANGE THINGS IN NATURE THAT I AM BECOME VERY DIFFIDENT OF ALL GENERAL ASSERTIONS AND VERY CAUTIOUS IN AFFIRMING WHAT MAY OR MAY NOT POSSIBLY BE THE MOST COMMON OPERATIONS BOTH OF THE ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE WORLD ARE ALL IN THEMSELVES ASTONISH ING AND NOTHING BUT DAILY EXPERIENCE AND CONSTANT OBSERVATION MAKES US SEE WITHOUT AMAZEMENT AN ANIMAL BRING FORTH ANOTHER OF THE SAME KIND OR A TREE BLOSSOM AND BEAR LEAVES AND FRUIT THE SAME OBSERVATION AND DAILY EXPERIENCE MAKE IT ALSO FAMILIAR TO US THAT BESIDES THE FIRST WAY OF PROPAGATING VEGETABLES FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE FRUIT AND SEED THEY ARE ALSO PROPAGATED FROM CUTTINGS AND EVERY ONE KNOWS THAT A TWIG OF A WILLOW PARTICU LARLY CUT OFF AND ONLY STUCK INTO THE GROUND DOES PRESENTLY TAKE ROOT AND GROW AND BECOMES AS MUCH A REAL AND PERFECT TREE AS THE ORIGINAL ONE FROM WHICH IT WAS FIRST TAKEN HERE IS THEN IN THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM THE VERY THING QUITE COMMON THAT MONSIEUR REAUMURS ME MOIR IS SAID TO GIVE A RARE EXAMPLE OF IN THE ANIMAL THE BEST PHILOSOPHERS HAVE LONG OBSERVED VERY STRONG ANALOGIES BETWEEN THESE TWO CLASSES OF BEINGS AND THE MODERNS AS THEY HAVE PENETRATED FURTHER INTO NATURE HAVE EVERY DAY FOUND REASON TO EXTEND THAT ANALOGY SOME HAVE EVEN WITH GREAT PROBA BILITY229 BILITY TALKED OF A SCALE OF NATURE IN WHICH SHE BY AN INSENSIBLE TRANSITION PASSED FROM THE MOST PER FECT OF ANIMALS NOT ONLY TO THE MOST IMPERFECT AND THENCE TO THE MOST IMPERFECT OF VEGETABLES BUT EVEN THROUGH CORALLINE BODIES AND MINERALS TO THE VERY EARTHS AND STONES WHICH SEEM THE MOST INA NIMATE PARTS OF OUR GLOBE NOW IN SUCH A SCALE WHO IS THE MAN THAT WILL BE BOLD TO SAY JUST HERE ANIMAL LIFE INTIRELY ENDS AND HERE VEGETABLE LIFE BEGINS OR JUST THUS FAR AND NO FURTHER ONE SORT OF OPERATIONS GOES AND JUST HERE ANOTHER SORT QUITE DIFFERENT TAKES ITS PLACE OR AGAIN WHO WILL VENTURE TO SAY LIFE IN EVERY ANI MAL IS A THING ABSOLUTELY DIFFERENT FROM THAT WHICH WE DIGNIFY BY THE SAME NAME IN EVERY VEGETABLE AND MIGHT NOT A MAN EVEN BE EXCUSED IF HE SHOULD MODESTLY DOUBT WHETHER PLANTS AND VEGETABLES MAY NOT THEMSELVES BE CONSIDERED AS A VERY LOW AND IM PERFECT TRIBE OF ANIMALS AS ANIMALS MIGHT IN LIKE MANNER BE CONSIDERED AS A MORE PERFECT AND EXALTED KIND OF VEGETABLES WE SEE THE TWO SEXES OF MALE AND FEMALE RUN THROUGH ALL THE HIGHER PARTS OF THE ANIMAL CREATION YET WOULD HE HAVE GONE A GREAT DEAL TOO FAR WHO SHOULD HAVE THENCE ASSERTED THERE WERE NO EXCEPTIONS TO THIS GENERAL OECONOMY OR THAT THIS WAS ONE OF THE GENERAL AND DISTINGUISHING AFFECTIONS OF ALL THE ANIMAL KIND FOR MODERN DISCOVERIES HAVE INFORMED US THAT THERE IS SOMEWHAT VERY ANALOGOUS TO THIS IN THE VEGETABLE CREATION ALSO AND EVEN IN THE ANI MAL IT HAS BEEN FOUND THAT SNAILS EARTHWORMS AND SOME OTHERS ARE REALLY HERMAPHRODITES HAVING IN THEMSELVES THE ORGANS OF BOTH SEXES WHILST THE WORK ING230 ING BEE IS TRULY OF NO SEX AT ALL NOR ANYWAYS IM PLOYED IN THE PRODUCTION OF THAT SPECIES IT LABOURS SO HARD DAILY TO PROVIDE WITH FOOD BUT WHEREAS IN ANIMALS THE DIVISION OF THE SEXES IS ALMOST GENERAL AND THE UNION OF THEM IN ONE SUBJECT APPEARS BUT IN A FEW INSTANCES CONTRARYWISE IN VEGETABLES ALMOST ALL HAVE THE WHOLE APPARATUS OF GENERATION IN EACH INDIVIDUAL WHILST ONLY A FEW SORTS SEEM TO EMULATE ANIMALS IN WHAT IS ANALOGOUS TO THE DIVISION OF THEM I SEEM PERHAPS TO WANDER TOO MUCH FROM THE POINT FIRSTMENTIONED BUT AS I AM ONLY OFFERING LOOSE HINTS AND SUCH WILD CONJECTURES AS COME IN MY WAY HOPE TO BE EXCUSED THOUGH I YET HAZARD ANOTHER OBSERVATION WHICH IS THAT WHAT APPEARS CHIEFLY TO BE NEW IN THE SUBJECT OF THIS MEMOIR IS THAT THE ANIMAL OR ANIMALS LIVE AND DO WELL AFTER THEIR SEPARATION AND THAT THEY ARE CAPABLE OF REPRO DUCING SUCH PARTS AS THE HEAD AND THE TAIL WHICH SEEMED ESSENTIALLY WANTING I SAY THAT THE ANIMALS LIVING AND DOING WELL AGAIN IS WHAT IS CHIEFLY NEW FOR THAT AN ANIMAL AFTER SE PARATION OF SOME OF THE PRINCIPAL PARTS SEEMS FOR SOME TIME TO RETAIN LIFE IN EACH PART MUST HAVE BEEN OBSERVED BY EVERY BODY  AND THOUGH PEOPLE GENE RALLY  THE ANTIENTS HAVE TAKEN NOTICE OF THIS AND SOME EVEN SEEM TO HAVE HAD NO DOUBT THAT LIFE CONTINUED SOME TIME IN THE PARTS OF A DIVIDED INSECT ARISTOTLE OBSERVES IN THE FOURTH BOOK OF HIS HISTORY OF ANIMALS THAT ALMOST ALL INSECTS LIVE SOME TIME WHEN PULLED ASUNDER WASPS PARTICULARLY AND THAT THOSE LIVE LONGEST WHEN SO SEPARATED WHICH HAVE A LONG BODY AND MANY FEET SO THAT THE SCOLOPENDRA BEING CUT ASUNDER ONE PART MOVES ON FORWARDS AND THE OTHER BACKWARDS BUT A PAS231 RALLY SAY FROM THEIR PREJUDICE IN FAVOUR OF SOME OF THE PRINCIPLES ABOVE HINTED AT THAT TO BE SURE ONLY ONE OF THE PARTS THOUGH THEY KNOW NOT ALWAYS WHICH FEELS AND HAS THE SENSATION OF PAIN YET HAVE ALL I HAVE EVER TALKED WITH ON THE SUBJECT AS FREELY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE PHAENOMENA APPEARED ON THE OTHER SIDE A CHICKEN OR A PIGEON WHOSE HEAD IS SUDDENLY STRUCK OFF SHEWS IN BOTH PARTS IF NO PRECONCEIVED OPINION LED US TO THINK OTHERWISE STRONG SIGNS OF PAIN AND SUFFERING AND THE VERY SAME SIGNS THAT THE RESPECTIVE PARTS OF THE ANIMAL SHEW OF THAT SENSATION WHILST IT IS SURELY LIVING AND INTIRE AND I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY SOME WHO HAVE SEEN THE HEADS OF MALEFACTORS SUDDENLY SEVERED FROM THEIR BODIES THAT THE SAME OBSERVATION HOLDS ALSO IN OUR OWN SPECIES BUT WE HAVE ALL SEEN IT HOLD MUCH STRONGER IN THE MORE IM PASSAGE OF ST AUSTIN IS SO REMARKABLE ON THIS HEAD THAT I CANNOT HELP

PERFECT232 PERFECT ANIMALS AS THEY ARE COMMONLY CALLED SUCH AS WORMS WHERE ON THE SEPARATION OF THE BODY INTO TWO PARTS LIFE HAS CONTINUED SEEMINGLY IN BOTH AND WITH STRONG SIGNS OF IT LONGER THAN WE HAVE HAD THE PATIENCE TO ATTEND AND EXAMINE WE HAVE BEEN IN DEED QUITE UNCERTAIN IN WHICH OF THE PARTS THIS SEEM ING LIFE HAS BEEN MOST CONSPICUOUS AND AS BOTH PARTS HAVE SEEMED TO ENDEAVOUR TO GET AWAY AND HAVE FREQUENTLY SOON AFTER BEEN FOUND MISSING BOYS AND ORDINARY PEOPLE ARE GENERALLY POSSESSED OF AN OPINION THAT THEY UNITE AND GROW TOGETHER AGAIN AFTER THEIR SEPARATION NOW IF IT COULD ONCE BE ALLOWED THAT ANIMAL LIFE AND SENSATION MIGHT SUBSIST BUT AN INSTANT IN BOTH PARTS OF THE CREATURE AFTER ITS SECTION THE WHOLE REMAINING DIFFICULTY WOULD BE ONLY AS TO THE CURE OF THE WOUNDS AND THE REPRODUCTION OF THE NECESSARY ORGANS THAT ARE WANTING AND FOR THE FIRST OF THESE WE KNOW VERY WELL THAT THE MORE IMPERFECT ANI MALS ARE KILLED WITH MUCH GREATER DIFFICULTY THAN THE MORE PERFECT THEIR VITALS BEING MORE DIFFUSED AND THEIR GENERAL ORGANIZATION BEING I SUPPOSE FAR MORE SIMPLE THAN THAT OF THE HIGHER TRIBES AND AS TO THE OTHER I THINK NO ONE WILL SEE ANY IMPOSSIBILITY IN THE REPRODUCTION OF CERTAIN PARTS AFTER WHAT WE HAVE SEEN AND READ OF IN THE LOBSTER AND CRAYFISH KINDS WHO WHEN THEY CHANCE BY ANY MISFORTUNE TO LOSE A CLAW REPRODUCE IT IN A SHORT TIME WITH ALL ITS JOINTS AND THE PROPER MUSCLES FOR MOVING THEM ALL WHICH APPEARS AS DIFFICULT AS THE REGAINING OF A MOUTH AND A TAIL TO SOME OF THE WORMKIND WHOSE GENERAL OR GANIZATION BEING SIMPLE AND CONSISTING CHIEFLY OF ONLY ONE STRAIT GUT OR PASSAGE FROM THE MOUTH TO THE VENT233 VENT THEY SEEM TO WANT LITTLE MORE TO REPRODUCE EITHER THAN A CONTRACTION OF THE WOUND WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE MUSCLES THAT MOVE THE SEVERAL RINGS OF WHICH THE BODY IS COMPOSED AND EVERY ONE OF WHICH IN ITS FIRST AND NATURAL STATE PERFORMS ALMOST THE SAME MOTIONS AS ARE NECESSARY FOR SUCTION OR EJECTION THE LATTER OF WHICH WE HAVE EVEN SOMETIMES SEEN VERY WONDERFULLY SUPPLIED IN OUR OWN SPECIES IN THOSE CASES WHERE GRIEVOUS WOUNDS OF THE INTESTINES HAVE PUT NATURE UPON TRYING TO PERFORM HER OPERATIONS IN A NEW WAY UPON THE WHOLE WE ARE ALL VERY DESIROUS TO SEE MONSIEUR REAUMURS MEMOIR ON THIS CURIOUS SUBJECT WE HOPE IT WILL SOON BE PUBLISHED WHEN AS HIS CURIOUS AND EXACT EXPERIMENTS WILL AFFORD INFINITE ENTERTAINMENT SO HIS JUDICIOUS REMARKS UPON THEM WILL DOUBTLESS BE NO LESS INSTRUCTIVE BUT WILL IN ALL PROBABILITY GIVE A LIGHT INTO THESE MATTERS WE DO NOT YET THINK OF IN THE MEAN TIME I COULD NOT HELP JUST MENTIONING TO YOU WHAT CAME INTO MY OWN HEAD ON THE OCCASION HOPING THAT HOWEVER YOU MAY LOOK ON MY THOUGHTS AS THE DREAMS PERHAPS OF A MAN BEWILDERED IN HIS INQUIRIES INTO NATURE YOU WILL STILL BELIEVE ME TO BE A FIRM AND CONSTANT LOVER OF TRUTH AND READY AT ALL TIMES TO RECEIVE AND EMBRACE WHATEVER IS REALLY SUCH HOWEVER ODD AND SURPRISING IT MAY AT THE FIRST CHANCE TO APPEAR I SHALL THEREFORE ONLY ADD ONE OR TWO FACTS I SHOULD INDEED HAVE MENTIONED BEFORE WHEN I WAS SPEAKING OF THE DIFFICULTY OF KILLING SOME OF THE TRIBES OF INSECTS AND REPTILES WHICH ARE THAT I HAVE MYSELF SEEN THE HEART OF A VIPER CONTINUE ITS REGULAR BEATS MORE THAN SIX HOURS AFTER IT HAD BEEN TAKEN OUT OF H H THE234 THE BODY THAT I HAVE SEEN THAT BODY MOVE AND SEEM ALIVE TO ALL PURPOSES FOR A GREAT PART OF THE SAME TIME AFTER HAVING LOST THE HEART AND THAT I HAVE SEEN WASPS WHOSE HEADS HAD BEEN TAKEN OFF CREEPING IN THE WINDOW THE NEXT DAY AND BUTTERFLIES THAT HAVE LIVED AND ATTEMPTED EVEN TO FLY SEVERAL DAYS AFTER UNDERGOING THE SAME SEVERE OPERATION INSECTS SEEM AT FIRST TO SUFFER BUT LITTLE FROM THE LOSS OF THEIR HINDER PARTS ALTHOUGH THESE CONTAIN MOST OF THEIR VISCERA NOR DOES THE LOSS OF LIMBS SEEM TO AFFECT THEM IN ANY PROPORTION TO THE MORE PERFECT ANIMALS BUT EVEN IN OUR OWN KIND IN INFANCY BEFORE THE PARTS HAVE LOST ALL THEIR SOFTNESS MUCH GREATER WOUNDS MAY BE RECEIVED WITHOUT LOSS OF LIFE THAN AFTERWARDS IF WE GO YET FURTHER BACK TO OUR EMBRYO STATE IT IS VERY PROBABLE THAT YET VASTLY GREATER HURTS ARE RECOVERABLE AND IT IS UPON THAT PRINCIPLE CHIEFLY THAT THE BEST AND MOST LIKELY AC COUNT HAS BEEN GIVEN BY MODERN WRITERS IN ANATOMY OF SOME VERY REMARKABLE MONSTERS THAT HAVE APPEARED IN THE WORLD WHERE EVEN SOME OF THE MOST ESSENTIAL PARTS OF TWO FAETUSS HAVE BEEN SEEN WONDERFULLY UNITED IN ONE AND THE SAME BODY I SHALL NOW DETAIN YOU NO LONGER THAN TO ASSURE YOU THAT I AM WITH TRUTH AND RESPECT S I R YOUR MOST OBEDIENT HUMBLE SERVANT C VI A

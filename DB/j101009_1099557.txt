how differently different courts apply the reasoning contained in decided cases to similar cases before them This is illustrated by reading together the two recent cases of Norfolk etc Ry Co v Tanner 8 Va Law Reg 182 June 1902 editorially approved pp 1934 and Duncan v Maine Cent R Co 113 Fed 508 U S C C Maine Feby 1902 Both Tanner and Duncan were injured while riding on gratuitous passes con taining agreements releasing the carriers from liability for negligence The Virginia court having cited together with certain textwriters Phila etc B Co v Derby N Y Cent R Co v Lockwood Ry Co v Stevens and others and distinguishing Balto etc R as v Voight said We feel that we could rest with safety upon the law as stated by the textWriters and decisions which we have considered    Thus the court held that law to be that such con tracts are void as against public policy irrespective of statute The Federal court took exactly the opposite view contending that there is nothing in those cases authorizing such a cor clusion and that the reasons given by the United States Supreme Court in denying the validity of such contracts between carriers392 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Sept and passengers for hire as Lockwood and Stevens were do not apply to cases of purely gratuitous passengers as Tanner and Duncan were Judge Keith asks Is the State solicitous only for the safety of those who pay their fare How does the fact that the passenger is being transported for hire or as a mere gratuity interest or affect the State Judge Putnam says p 511 Mr Justice Shiras states the principles which justify the courts in holding that as between common carriers and their customers there are certain rules of public policy which require apparent interference with freedom of contract He refers to the importance which the law justly attaches to human life and personal safety and he says that the second fundamental proposition relied on to nullify contracts to relieve common carriers from liability caused by negligence is based on the position of advantage possessed by them over those who are compelled to deal with them He thus refers to what underlies what we have cited from Mr Justice Gray The first topic to which he refers that is the importance which the law attaches to human life and personal safety he evidently does not regard as essential to the issue because in the very case before him he and the court in whose behalf he was speaking rejected all such considerations And on p 513 Moreover if propositions of this character i e the importance which the law attaches to human life forbidding that relaxation of care in the transportation of passengers which might be supposed to be induced by special stipulations relieving the carrier could operate in behalf of the plaintiff they would also have reached R Co v Voight and necessarily have compelled a different conclusion in that case because they are in all respects as applicable there as here And in holding that the gratuitous passenger Duncan did not come within the second fundamental proposition of public policy announced by Mr Justice Shiras Judge Putnam said p 511 Now it is plain that the plaintiff was not within the language of Mr Justice Gray a customer who had no real freedom of choice It is also plain that in the matter of the pass in question he and the defendant stood on a footing of entire equality and that neither had occasion to deal with the other except at his or its absolute option It is also in the same way clear to apply the language of Mr Justice Shiras that in the transaction before us the defendant had no position of advantage over  one who was compelled to deal  with it and that the plaintiff is in no sense one who came within that class described by him as yielding exemptions extorted from customers by duress of circumstances Payne v Terre Haute etc R Co Ind 60 N E 362 cited by the editor as  maintaining the view adopted by the Virginia court has been reversed by the Supreme Court of that State See 11 Am Neg Rep 205 It may be pertinent to ask at this point why does a citizen forfeit his States interest in his personal safety by accepting employment with a travelling circus or the express service or the Pullman service While travelling on such busi ness he is without doubt lawfully on the train and he is carried for hire and in the absence of a contract to the contrary the carrier is a liable to him as to a passenger Hutch Carr secs 5634  Chamberlain v Pierson 31 C C A 164  N  W R Co v Shott 92 Va 34 Brewer v N Y etc R Co 124 N Y 59 yet such contracts with those persons are universally upheld on the ground that the carriage of such persons is not one of the essential duties of a carrier and that it may as to them become a private carrier

Pac Ry Co 115 U S 587 But may it not just as truly be said that a carrier is not a common carrier of passengers on freight trains and that such carriage is not one of its essential duties Yet if it undertakes to carry a passenger on a freight train it is as responsible to him as if he were on a passenger train Hutch Carr sec 538a  So Ry Co v Dawson 98 Va 577 Cent of Ga By Co v Lippman 110 Ga 665

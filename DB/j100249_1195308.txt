j100249,The Journal of Religion,1195308,A Textbook on the Philosophy of Religion,i251290,BOOK REVIEWS A TEXTBOOK ON THE PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION He who prepares a college textbook particularly one on a philo sophical or religious subject is fortunate if he escape the Scylla of didactic dogmatism without falling into the Charybdis of mere listing of uncriti cized facts and theories In his new book Professor Wright steers a skilful pedagogical course The reader is challenged to think for himself Wright nowhere seeks surreptitiously to acquire merit for his own views under the guise of an it is generally held or the modern view is but he honestly and plainly labels them as  the authors opinions The method of treatment is empirical and inductive The book is divided into three parts Part I Religion and the Conservation of Values contains thirteen chapters It consists of crosssections from the history of religion in its primitive and its developed forms Brah manism Buddhism the religions of Greece and Rome Judaism and Christianity are discussed but Confucianism and Mohammedanism are omitted Part II Religion and the Self four chapters is chiefly psychological Wright interprets the religious impulse as a sentiment his treatment of this conception is original and suggestive Religious growth and conversion prayer and mysticism are taken up in some detail Part III Religion and Reality five chapters deals with the metaphysics of religion It tries to answer the question Is religion true  It covers mechanism and teleology belief in God the problem of evil freedom and immortality The author proposes the following definition which is historical not normative Religion is the endeavor to secure the conservation of socially recognized values through specific actions that are believed to evoke some agency different from the ordinary ego of the individual or from other merely human beings and that imply a feeling of depend ence upon this agency p 47 This well combines the contributions of Schleiermacher and H6ff ding with the modern social interest Oddly the author does not mention H6ffdings name still more oddly he states that he includes in conservation     the quantitative increase A Students Philosophy of Religion By William Kelly Wright New York Macmillan Co 1922 xii472 pages 375 437438 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION of values p 443 without noting that H6ffding had already called attention to this same point Wright believes that religion is true and that Christianity is the truest religion p 212 In reply to the muchdiscussed question whether religious values are unique and autonomous the author inclines to a negative opinion p 222 yet his conception of the religious senti ment as having a characteristic object the agency mentioned in the definition would point toward an affirmative answer He should take into account Rudolf Ottos Das Heilige The arguments for a teleo logical and moral universe he regards as adequate to justify faith The facts of evil lead him to join what may be called the neoGnostic or Wellsian movement by denying the creatorship and affirming the finite ness of God pp 373 f 437 Prayer Wright interprets as objective in the light of the divine immanence pp 283 f On immortality he abstains from definite conclusions but evidently inclines to faith in personal immortality p 441 cf pp 426 ff Naturally there is much in such a book to call forth difference of opinion Part I seems to the reviewer at once too long and too short too long in that the treatment of primitive religions and of Christianity might have been condensed too short by virtue of the omission of Mohammedanism and Confucianism in a year of grace when Islam and China loom large on the worldhorizon Resemblances and differences between Christianity and mystery religions are mentioned but the burn ing question of how much the former owes to the latter is not discussed pp 119 f 123 ff 16o ff The psychological part of the book gives no adequate account of the social significance of religious consciousness it suffers also from too much metaphysical interpretation which would have been more appropriate and more intelligible in Part III Some of the usually wellselected bibliographies contain too many references to relatively ephemeral current literature and too few to great standard works In the philosophical part of the book the general arguments for God are clearer and more explicit than the definition and defense of the specific concept of God at which the author arrives Perhaps this defect is a merit in a book intended to stimulate the student Typographically the book is admirable Few misprints occur Capitolanus  p 135 should read  Capitolinus and Thomas Cokel p 190 should read Thomas Coke EDGAR S BRIGHTMAN BOSTON UNIVERSITY H6ffding mentioned it Philosophy of Religion p ii Sorley criticized H6ffding for neglecting it Moral Values and the Idea of God ist ed p I79 and now Wright rediscovers it

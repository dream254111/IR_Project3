J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1014095,SOME FACTS TO BE CONSIDERED IN CONNECTION WITH THE FOOD PROBLEM,I242662,SOME FACTS TO BE CONSIDERED IN CONNECTION WITH THE FOOD PROBLEM BY HOWARD HEINZ CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEE ON FOOD SUPPLY COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC SAFETY OF PENNSYL VANIA DR NANSEN SPOKE ABOUT THE MISFORTUNE OF NORWAY IN LOSING ALMOST ALL HER FINE INHABITANTS AND I WANT TO SAY THAT IT HAS BEEN MY EXPERIENCE THAT IT HAS BEEN THIS COUNTRYS GOOD FORTUNE TO HAVE GAINED THEM I BELIEVE IF EVERY MAN AND WOMAN IN THIS COUNTRY KNEW MR HOOVER AS HE IS THE UNSELFISH WAY IN WHICH HE IS GOING ABOUT HIS JOB THE FACT THAT HE HAS NOTHING TO GAIN NO GLORY IN IT BUT RUNS THE CHANCE OF CRITICISM FROM FARMER FROM DISTRIBUTOR AND FINALLY FROM THE CONSUMERTHEY WOULD STILL BETTER REALIZE THE SIZE AND IMPORTANCE OF THE SERVICE THAT HE IS GIVING TO HIS COUNTRY I SPEAK NOT AS AN EXPERT NOT AS A SCIENTIST BUT JUST AS A PLAIN COMMON CONSUMER WHO IS VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN THE PROBLEM THAT CONCERNS THE PEOPLE OF OUR COMMONWEALTH THE NATION AND THE WORLD AT LARGE OUR FOOD SUPPLY WITH BETWEEN THIRTY AND THIRTYFIVE MILLION MEN IN UNIFORM CONSUMING A DAILY AVERAGE OF AT LEAST 35 TO 40 PER CENT MORE THAN IS THEIR CUSTOM WITH EVERY MAN AND WOMAN IN THIS COUNTRY WHO IS WILLING TO WORK IN A JOB WHICH MEANS ALSO INCREASED CONSUMPTION OF FOOD WE HAVE THE GREATEST DEMAND FOR FOOD THAT THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN WHAT HAVE WE IN SUPPLY IN THE MEAT SUPPLY WE HAVE A WORLD SHORTAGE OF 115000000 MEAT ANIMALS TODAY AND IT IS GROWING EVERY DAY BECAUSE OF THE INABILITY OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT FODDER IN ENGLAND TODAY THEY HAVE DECIDED TO BEGIN KILLING OFF MORE EXTENSIVELY THEIR ANIMALS IN ORDER TO PRESERVE THEIR MAIZE FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION IN THIS COUNTRY WE HAVE TODAY SEVEN MILLION LESS MEAT ANIMALS THAN WE HAD SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO AND OUR POPULA TION IS 26000000 MORE THAN IT WAS AT THAT TIME THUS YOU CAN SEE HOW FAR AWAY WE ARE FROM MEETING EVEN THE HOME DEMAND AND THE 119120 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY REASON FOR THE PRESENT PRICE OF MEAT I THINK IT IS ESTIMATED THAT 43 PER CENT OF MANS LIVING COST GOES FOR FOOD AND NEARLY 50 PER CENT OF THAT ON AN AVERAGE GOES INTO MEAT AND MEAT PRODUCTS HENCE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MEAT SITUATION THE WORLD WHEAT SHORTAGE AMOUNTS TO MILLIONS OF BUSHELS OUR ALLIES HAVE CALLED UPON US FOR BETWEEN 250000000 AND 300000000 BUSHELS OF WHEAT IF WE CAN GET BOATS OVER SAFELY WITH IT AND IF WE CANT GOD PITY OUR ALLIES NOW HOW ARE WE GOING TO MEET THIS QUESTION OF WORLD SHORTAGE IN FOOD SUPPLIES I WANT TO DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION TO WHAT SEEMS TO ME TO BE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT POINTS AND ONE OF THE FIRST TO BE DISCUSSED NAMELY THE QUESTION OF PRODUCTION PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN CITIES AND WHO HAVE TO PAY HIGH PRICES DONT CONSIDER THAT SUFFI CIENTLY WE HAVE TO ENTER INTO A SERIOUS CONSIDERATION OF THE WORLDS PRODUCTION MARKETS TO ENABLE US TO GAIN A PROPER ATTITUDE TOWARD THE PRODUCER THE FARMER IS TOO LITTLE UNDERSTOOD HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANY MILLIONAIRES MADE ON FARMS I HAVENT FORTY PER CENT OF THE FARMS IN THIS STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA ARE OCCUPIED BY TENANTS TODAY DOES THAT INDICATE THAT THERE IS VERY MUCH MONEY IN FARMING IN PENNSYLVANIA DO YOU KNOW THAT THE FARMER IS PAYING FROM 75 TO 150 PER CENT MORE FOR HIS MACHINERY DO YOU KNOW THAT HIS LABOR HAS INCREASED OVER 100 PER CENT HIS SEED HAS INCREASED IN SOME INSTANCES FROM 200 TO 300 PER CENT HIS FERTILIZER WHEN HE CAN GET IT IS AT ALMOST PROHIBITIVE PRICES THE FARMER HAS PROB LEMS THAT WE MUST HELP HIM TO MEET IT MIGHT FOR EXAMPLE BE VERY MUCH BETTER FOR US TO PAY AN INCREASED PRICE FOR MILK AS A MEANS OF DIMINISHING THE NUMBER OF DAIRY CATTLE THAT ARE BEING SOLD FOR SLAUGHTER BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COST OF FEED FOR IF THEY GO ON KILLING OFF DAIRY COWS AT THE RATE THEY HAVE IN THE LAST THREE OF FOUR MONTHS MILK IS MORE LIKELY TO BE TWENTY CENTS A QUART WITHIN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS THAN TO BE LESS IN OTHER WORDS AS A FIRST STEP IN SOLVING THE FOOD PROBLEM WE MUST ENCOURAGE THE PRODUCER AND GIVE HIM AT LEAST A REASONABLE PROFIT IF WE WANT HIM TO CONTINUE IN BUSINESS THE PROPER ENCOURAGEMENT OF PRODUCTION IF WE WILL JUST CARRY IT FAR ENOUGH WILL TAKE US A GREAT WAY TOWARD THE SOLUTION OF THE ENTIRE DIFFICULTY FOR WE CAN TALK ABOUT MARKETING AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT CONSERVATION BUT IF WE DONT PRODUCE WE WONT HAVE ANY THING TO DISTRIBUTE OR TO CONSERVE THE PERPLEXING SUBJECT OF MARKETS AND DISTRIBUTION IS RECEIVINGTHE FOOD PROBLEM 121 MUCH ATTENTION IN WASHINGTON AND BY THE VARIOUS STATES THE MIDDLEMAN WHO IS CONCERNED WITH THIS PHASE OF THE SITUATION IS BLAMED PERHAPS UNJUSTLY FOR MANY OF OUR WOES I DONT BELIEVE THERE IS GOING TO BE ESTABLISHED IMMEDIATELY A NEW METHOD OF MARKET ING THERE WILL BE SOME ATTEMPTS AT IT THAT WILL HELP THE SITUATION BUT A COMPLETE CHANGE OF OUR WHOLE MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTING PROBLEM WILL NOT BE MADE IN A DAY IT HAS TAKEN A GREAT MANY YEARS TO GET US INTO OUR PRESENT CONDITION AND IT WILL TAKE US SOME YEARS TO GET OUT OF IT BUT THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE I THINK THE FEDERAL FOOD ADMINISTRATION LAW AS INTERPRETED AND PUT INTO EXECUTION BY MR HOOVER AND THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH HIM WILL TEND TO ELIMINATE SOME OF THE EXTRA COMMISSION MEN AND BROKERS THAT ARE NOT ONLY NEEDLESS BUT ACTUALLY DETRIMENTAL TO BOTH PRO DUCING AND CONSUMING INTERESTS I THINK TOO THAT MR HOOVERS CONTROL OF PROFITS THE PREVENTION OF HOARDING THE CUTTING OUT OF SPECULATION WILL GO A LONG WAY TOWARD SOLVING THE PROBLEM OF DISTRIBUTION COST WOE BE TO THE FOOD PIRATE WHO FALLS INTO THE CLUTCHES OF THE LAW IT WILL NOT BE VERY HEALTHFUL FOR HIM AND IT SHOULDNT BE FOR WITH THE CONDITION OF THE FOOD SUPPLY OF THE WORLD TODAY FOR A MAN TO BARGAIN TO HOARD TO SPECULATE IN THAT WHICH CONCERNS HUMAN EXISTENCE IS AN OUTRAGE AGAINST HUMAN ITY AND SHOULD BE STAMPED OUT WE ARE TRYING IN PENNSYLVANIA SOME CHANGES FROM THE REGULA TION CHANNELS OF DISTRIBUTION BY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CURB MARKETS THEY HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN A NUMBER OF PLACES AND WE HAVE IN VIEW THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MANY MORE OF THEM THEY BRING THE PRODUCER AND THE CONSUMER IMMEDIATELY TOGETHER THE PRODUCER GETTING MORE FOR HIS PRODUCE THAN HE WOULD THROUGH THE COMMISSION MAN AND THE RETAIL GROCER AND THE CONSUMER GETTING HIS GOODS MORE CHEAPLY ANOTHER FEATURE OF THE DISTRIBUTION PROBLEM THAT DEMANDS REFORM IS THE MATTER OF MERCHANDISING SERVICE FOR MANY YEARS MERCHANTS HAVE BEEN EDUCATING CONSUMERS TO EXPECT SERVICE WITH EVERY PURCHASE AND OF COURSE THE CONSUMER IS CHARGED FOR THE SERVICE WHETHER HE GETS IT OR NOT NOW IF THE CONSUMER WILL GO TO THE STORE AND SHOP FOR WHAT IS THERE PAY CASH AND CARRY IT AWAY WE CAN CUT DOWN THE COST OF DISTRIBUTION CONSIDERABLY ONE GROCER TOLD ME THAT HE COULD AFFORD WITHOUT ANY QUESTION TO REDUCE HIS PRICES PARTICULARLY OF PERISHABLES FROM 10 TO 12 PER CENT IF PEOPLE WOULD COME TO HIS STORE PAY CASH AND TAKE THE THINGS HOME IN REGARD122 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY TO THE QUESTION OF DELIVERIES SOME GRIOCERS ACTUALLY AVERAGE FOUR DELIVERIES PER DAY PER HOUSE SOMEBODY HAS TO PAY FOR THIS AND AS SUCH SERVICE IS ALWAYS UNEQUAL THE POOR WHO NATURALLY RECEIVE THE LEAST SUFFER MOST SUCH PRACTICES MUST STOP IF WE ARE TO HAVE ANY KIND OF A FAIR METHOD OF DISTRIBUTION I HEARD THE OTHER DAY THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE IN A CERTAIN BAKERY TO BAKE BREAD FOR FOUR AND ONEHALF CENTS FOR A FOURTEENOUNCE LOAF BUT THAT WHEN THAT LOAF WAS DELIVERED TO THE FAMILY IT ACTUALLY COST SEVEN AND ONEHALF CENTS NOW THINK OF IT FROM THE BAKERY TO THE GROCERY STORE THROUGH THE GROCERY STORE AND DELIVERED TO THE HOUSE IT WENT UP FROM FOUR AND ONEHALF CENTS TO SEVEN AND ONEHALF CENTS ALMOST 75 PER CENT THAT BAKERY COULD HAVE SOLD ITS PRODUCT AT THE BAKERY DOOR WITH SERVICE ELIMINATED FOR FIVE CENTS THE THIRD THING THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH IN THIS PROBLEM OF FOOD SUPPLY IS THE GREAT ONE OF CONSERVATION THE WOMEN OF PENN SYLVANIA HAVEFOR WE HAVE HAD INVESTIGATIONS MADE WHICH SHOW ITPRACTICED AVOIDANCE OF WASTE TO THE EXTENT THAT SOME OF THE GARBAGE PLANTS OR PEOPLE IN THE FERTILIZING BUSINESS WHO GET THEIR MATERIAL FROM GARBAGE PLANTS HAVE BEEN COMPLAINING OVER THE LACK OF GARBAGE THAT IS BEING COLLECTED RECENTLY IN FOOD CONSERVATION I THINK THE WOMEN HAVE CAUGHT ON TO WHAT IS NECESSARY MANY OF THEM PRACTICED THRIFT LONG BEFORE THIS WAR CAME ON BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY DID SO DOESNT MEAN THAT THERE ISNT A LOT MORE TO DO BECAUSE THERE ARE LITTLE ENDS TO PUT IN HERE AND THERE THAT STILL WOULD MAKE A BIG VOLUME AS APPLIED TO THE WHOLE OF THE COUNTRY BUT THERE IS ONE FACTOR THAT DOESNT KNOW WHAT FOOD CONSERVA TION MEANS AND I AM SORRY TO SAY IT IS MY OWN SEX TAKING HIM AS A WHOLE MAN DOES NOT SEEM TO REALIZE WHAT IS NECESSARY FOR HIM TO DO IN FOOD CONSERVATION THEY SAY THAT THAT IS A WOMANS PROBLEM I HAVE SEEN VERY FEW MEN EATING IN RESTAURANTS WHO HAVE CHANGED THEIR USUAL HABITS THEN I THINK ABOUT 10 PER CENT OF THE POPULATION IN THIS COUNTRY PROBABLY OVEREAT 50 PER CENT AND THAT ANOTHER 25 PER CENT OVEREAT 25 PER CENT THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME WHO DO OVEREAT AND PERHAPS DEPRIVE SOMEBODY ELSE OF NEEDED FOOD AND AT THE SAME TIME HELPING THE CONTINUAL ADVANCE IN PRICES AND I WANT TO SAY TO YOU THAT I FEAR PRICES WILL BE HIGHER BEFORE THEY ARE LOWER THE CROPS ARE NEARLY GARNERED WE KNOW PRETTY NEARLY WHAT WE HAVE GOT AND WE KNOW HOW FAR IT FALLS SHORT OF OUR DEMAND123 THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE DEALING DIRECTLY WITH THE FOOD PROBLEM ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES WHO SHOULD STUDY IT AND OBSERVE THE PRINCIPLES INVOLVED IN IT EVERY MAN WOMAN AND CHILD SHOULD ENTER INTO THE WAR TO THE EXTENT OR REALIZING EACH HIS OWN PERSONAL INDIVIDUAL RE SPONSIBILITY AND SHOULD PLAY HIS PART IF OUR COUNTRY HOPES TO WIN THE WAR FOR DEMOCRACY IT WILL TAKE EVERY BIT THAT EVERYBODY HAS WITH PERFECT TEAM PLAY TO WIN THE BATTLE GOD GRANT THAT WE MAY WIN IT SOON

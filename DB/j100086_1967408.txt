j100086,Annals of Mathematics,1967408,The Gamblers Ruin,i307116,THE GAMBLERS RUIN BY J L COOLIDGE THE various problems which are connected with games of chance have interested mathematicians ever since the time of Pascal In particular the probability that when two men are playing together at a certain game the one will end by mining the other and the probable number of turns before one players ruin has been studied by James Bernouilli DeMoivre Lagrange Laplace and others In all of these works however it is assumed that the amount of the stakes is the same at each turn and the problem of showing that regardless of the amount which is staked the probability of ruin for the one or the other player lies within certain definite limits has not so far as I have been able to discover ever been undertaken In general the mathemati cian assumes without any proof that whoever indulges in a game favorable to his adversary has a very strong chance of being ruined regardless of what system of play he may affect The player on the other hand ascribing to the goddess of fortune a desire which she does not possess to atone for past errors works out a system of play in which he confides It is the object of the present paper to show that no such system can have more than an easily calculable chance of success 1 Unlimited Stakes Let us imagine that two persons called re spectively the player and the banker are playing at a game of chance The effective difference between the two is that the player has the right to settle the amount of the stake each time and also to leave off when he chooses Suppose first that the player has a capital which compared with the bankers may be roughly called indefinitely great Such is in filct approximately the case when the banker conducts a public gaming establishment ready to meet all comers The probability that the player will be ruined is here negligible On the other hand if the player begin by staking the amount of the bankers fortune and doubles his stake every time he loses the probability that he will end by ruining the banker is very large indeed For that reason public gaming establishments habitually set an upper limit to the amount which  See Todhunters History of the Theory of Probability London 1865 181182 COOLIDGEj Uuly may be staked Let us secondly suppose that whereas the player has only a fortune of rn the bankers fortune is quasiinfinite in comparison therewith Let us say that a first game is finished when either the player is ruined or he has doubled his original fortune As in this game his stake is surely less than 2rnz we are under the second case of limited stakes to be treated pres ently and the chance that the player will escape ruin is not over onehalf unless the game is favorable to him as is not the case in public gaming If the player win the first game let him start another which shall terminate when the one side or the other has won 2rn Once more his chance of escaping ruin is j Keeping on thus we see that if the player undertake to play an indefinite number of games the chance that he will never be ruined is o X i X i   indefinitely small If the player and banker have each a finite sum the maximum stake is surely less than their combined fortunes and we are under our second case 2 Limited Stakes Let us assume that the player has a fortune m and that he undertakes to play until either he losses the whole of this or wins the sum n from the banker This is the usual state of affairs in public gam bling although some players being with a very indefinite notion of the value of n which has the effect of making n very large thereby greatly increasing the probability that the player will be ruined When the player has won the sum n we shall for convenience say that the bank has been ruined though the player of ordinary means who should really set n at the amount of the banks funds would do a very foolish thing For the sake of simplicity we shall assume that if the player is so nearly ruined that he cannot afford to stake as much as he wishes then he stakes all that he has whereas if his win nings are so near to n that the residue is less than the banker should put up in order to cover the players usual stake then also we shall assume that the player reduces his stake accordingly As a matter of fact it does not make any great difference how we treat these extreme circumstances unless mn  n is a comparatively small multiple of the amount of the stake or unless the game is grossly unfavorable to one side when either of these cases arises the ruin of the less favored party is almost certain What do we mean by the garnes being favorable or unfavorable to one side  1 r If a man have mutually exclusive chances P1 P2  pr where E pi  1 i1909 THE GAMBLER S RUIN

that he will win This rule is easily extended to any number of persons Suppose next that we have a succession of two fair plays the players and bankers chances and stakes being respectively al Pi bl

reasoning may be continued indefinitely whence Any succession of fair plays will constitute a fair game The commonest games are those where p and q retain constant values let us show that if such a fair game be continued indefinitely the ruin of either player or banker is certain The players fortune is set at m the bankers at n We first suppose that the stakes are constant a and b If v turns be

theorem equally likely to be positive or negative If after v1 turns it be found to be positive after v2 turns more it will have a greater chance of being positive than negative but this dispro portion approaches zero as a limit as V2 increases indefinitely and may be disregarded when v2 is very large The quantities e2   e may be positive or negative and may all have like signs or opposite signs in varying propor tions Let us assume hence that P represents the probability that after v turns the sign of et shall be that of If the probability that in t series of v1 V2 vt turns each the cis shall never after vj turns all have the same sign as K is jt ir and this quantity approaches zero as a limit as t increases indefinitely But when all the es but e1 have the same sign as x the ruin of the one party or the other is even more certain than in the case of constant stakes The ruin of one party or the other being thus assured we may easily cal culate the probability favorable to each Let P be the probability that the player shall ruin the banker and Q  1  P the probability that the banker shall ruin the player As the game is fair the expectation of each is zero hence PnQmO P  Q n 2 It should be noticed that these values are independent of the amounts staked We must now pass to the case of a game which is unfavorable to the player Here pb qaO 3 a and b shall be constant stakes

of modification in this formula in order that it cover the case when one side or the other can not put up the requisite stake This fact is theoretically important but practically insignificant as we have already pointed out When the players fortune has sunk to e  a the chance favorable to him is certainly less than em  n a trivial fraction when n is large compared with a On the other hand when the bankers fortune is reduced to v1  b if the game be nearly fair his chance is but little over nmn  n It is now time to take up the elusive case where the player may alter his stake at will Assuming that a is the largest allowable stake let us imagine that the player leads off with a stake a less than a but constantly plays a thereafter Has he improved or injured his chance The latter is in the present case made up of two parts according as he wins or loses the first play so that it has the value amnb  1 amis P amn 1 q amn 1 7 Subtracting this expression from 5 we get am panb  qama am  1

is less than 7 and a fortiori less than 5 We may pursue this line of reasoning further As it was a mistake for the player to replace his first stake by another smaller stake so it will be a further error for him to replace a in his second stake by a smaller value and so on We have already seen that any series of stakes whatsoever is sure to end in the ruin of the one party or the other and we now see that no other series gives the player such a good chance as he gets by playing the maximum each time We thus reach our fundamental theorem Theplayers best chance of winning a certain sum at a disadvantageous game is to stake the sum which will bring him that return in one play or if that be not allowed to make always the largest stake which the banker will accept1909 THE GAMBLER S RUIN 189 The principal deduction from this is of a moral nature The average gambler will say The plaver who stakes his whole fortune on a single play is a fool and the science of mathematics can not prove him to be otherwise The reply is obvious The science of mathematics never attempts the im possible it merely shows that other players are greater fools Let us make some simple deductions from our formula

player should become frightened and reduce his stake to  hischance would be reduced to 1 aam  1 When a and b are equal a 10 When m is decidedly large the probability that the banker will be ruined is close to an 1 3 The Game of Roulette As an application of the foregoing prin ciples I am going to consider the game of roulette as played at Monte Carlo This game has two advantages the honesty of the banker is above suspicion and the players disadvantage is less than in any other form of gambling with which I am familiar The following description is taken from Sir Hiram Maxim The roulette consists of a large circular basin about two feet in diameter withtheouter rimturned inward The bottom of thebasin whichforms the wheel Monte Carlo Facts and Fancies London 1906 pp 257 if190 COOLIDGE July is of metal quite separate from the rin or sides and is nicely balanced and mounted on a fine pivot so that when set in motion it will spin for a consider able time The outer edge of the wheel is accurately divided into thirtyseven sections of pockets eighteen of which are painted red and eighteen black One is called zero and is neutral in color The pockets are numbered from one to thirtysix The wheel is set in motion and a small ball started rolling around the edge in the opposite direction The game consists in betting on the number or color of the division into which the ball will eventually roll There are fourteen different methods of staking The simplest are red or black even or odd above or below eighteen In each of these cases the player and banker stake equal sums If a player stake upon a number the banker puts up thirtyfive times the amount The upper limit for a simple stake say red or black is twelve hundred dollars a player may not stake more than thirtysix dollars on a number When the ball falls into zero the player on a simple chance may either forfeit one half of his stake or leave the whole in prison till the next turn If he be fortunate at this turn he saves his stake but gets nothing further if he lose the stake is gone forever On the other hand all who have staked on particular numbers or combinations thereof lose their stakes at once on the arrival of zero What are the probabilities of success for a player staking on a simple chance as red or black We may imagine that he plays twelve hundred dollars each time and this sum we shall call one so that mn and n represent the players and the bankers fortunes respectively expressed as multiples of twelve hundred In seventyfour turns the player may expect on an average thirtysix reds thirtysix blacks one zero followed by a loss and one zero followed by a gain which leaves matters just as before and may be counted out We have then 36 37 J  T J7   737 ab1 a 3 The players probability of winning is 37 j 37 mfn1909 THE GAMBLERS RUIN 191 When m and n are equal this becomes 1 37 Let us next suppose that the player stakes upon a number The amount which may be staked is here about one thirtythird of what it was before so that the game is the same as if the stake remained constant and the for tunes of both banker and player were increased thirtythree fold The prob ability for the player will be the same as before if a be equal to the thirty third root of 37 and will be less if a be larger Now the thirtythird root of 37 is 100085 36 To find a we have p  1 q  3 a  1 b  35 a  1  e 1  636  371  e  36  0 1  36 e  630 e2  37  37 e  36  0 1  e 631  10015 This method is therefore somewhat less favorable to the player than the other A third simple game is played by staking on all the numbers but one The maximum allowable here is thirtyfive times thirtysix dollars not far from twelve hundred so that we may call the stake one as before Each time the player wins at this game he sacrifices thirtyfour thirtyfifths of his stake so that b is one thirtyfifth We shall further have 35 2 qapb  7 whereas in the simple game qapb 13192 COOLIDGE which shows that staking on thirtyfive numbers would be an unwise method of play When n is large the chance of ruin for the bank is 1 We have no accurate data as to the amount of wn but apparently as the banks earnings in a year are between five and six million dollars  it is not unreasonable to suppose that the sum of one million two hundred thousand dollars might be produced in a very short time The chance of ruin on red ox black is therefore not abode 36 1000 I 376 792870000000 I conclude with two more quotations from Maxims book The first is from a letter from Baron Czyllak quoted on p 172 The calculation of probabilities by means of which inventors of systems seek to master roulette and also the theory of roulette have for their author the same savant that is to say the celebrated Pascal So does posterity treat the great theologian whose treatise on cycloids is called Histoire de la roulette  The next quotation is from Maxim himself on p 190 and gives the best explanation which I have seen for the fact the people continue to gamble Je me rends parftitement cornpte du desagreable effet que produit sur la majorite de lhumanit6 tout ce qui se rapporte meme au plus faible degfi a des

favorable surfaces for marking and when these were found the double or treble use in some instances was noticed  After having actually gotten on to the rocks and discovered what they were and how to distinguish and copy them it appeared that with the exception of a very few characters recently dug or chipped out by lumbermen or visitors almost always initials the only interesting or ancient portions were scratchings which could be made by any sharp instrument on soft and polished slate The rocks were great drawingslates affording a temptation to any idly disposed person to scratch Happening to have with me an Indian stone arrow which had been picked up in the neighborhood I used that upon the surface and it would make as good scratches as any upon the rocks except the very latest which were evidently cut with metal knives by the whites The time in which I was actually at work in taking copies was very short only parts of two days and then a violent storm arose which continued for several days during which time it was impossible not only to see the faint scratchings which were of interest but even to move over the rocks as they were rendered as slippery as glass by the moisture and then I was forced to leave for Washington  The mode in which I took the copies was by running over and through their outlines with a blue aniline pencil and then pressing a wetted sheet of linen or paper upon them so that the impression was taken as by print Purposely in order to experiment upon a successful mode of getting the copies I made my first work upon those that were of least apparent interest exyiergmentvzn gn corpore vzEw so that I should not by my operations spoil those which were of more importance The main object which I had in the examina tion of the inscriptions was to ascertain whether there were upon these rocks any of the more simple and more probably aboriginal characters that are found in the hieroglyphs of Kauder In the short time that I was at work I discovered certainly two of the characters what were ill Kauders work ESoth of these are similar to but not identical with symbols of the Roman Catholic Church  It still remains undetermined whether those particular charac ters were imitated by Indians during the last two hundred years from religious symbols collected by Kauder or whether those re ligious symbols had been adapted from some characters which had previously been in use A more extensive examination and study of the characters on the rocks of which plobably there are thousands that I did not copy or indeed carefully examine would be necessary before it could be determined to verify my hy pothesis that the scratching of symbols on these rocks would be ex planatory of the Micmac printed hieroglyphs On one point the peculiar multiplication of the characters af fords an index to antiquity beyond mrhat is generally possible The existence of two or three different sets of markings all visible and of different clegrees of distinctness is in itself important but ilu addition to that it is frequently the case that the second and third in the order of time have associatecl with them dates from which the relative antiquity of the faintest and dateless can be to some extent estimated The third and most recent class of dates are English names and are associated with the forms of English let ters the second class are French names and in some cases have French designs  There is an interesting story on this subJect vvXch was corr municated to me from Louis Labrador whose greatgrandfather old Ledore according to his account piloted a body of French tcadians who at the time of the expulsion in I756 were not shipped off with the majority They escaped the English and trarrelled from the valley of Annapolis to Shelbourne at the extreme southeast of the peninsula and were on their way from May to October During that passage they halted for a considerable time to recruit in this beautiful valley along the Kejimkoojik Lake the very spot where these markings appear and which was on the an cient Indian trail It is exceedingly probable that the French would have been attracted to scratch on these fascinating smooth slate surfaces whether or not they had observed previous markings but it seems evident that thev did scratch over such previous mark ings Therefore the latter antedated the middle of the eighteenth century 4One of the printed impressions taken in the manner before mentioned is of a bat between an armed brig and troops or Indians on land which might have been one of the several naval expedi tions against the Acadians as forinstance that of Argall in 16I4 or Cromwells of I654 and which was etched as of historical inter est by the French wanderers at the time mentioned The rig of the vessel has not been used for at least a century and the top where men are shooting at those on shore reminds of the old seafights under the Stuarts The artist has drawn his brig down to the keel without leference to the displacement of water or to perspective and afterwards superposed the shoreline and its de fenders 4 The other impressions copied on linen and presented to show the character of the work on the rocks but by no means its intrin sic value are a peculiarly drawn star appearing many times in Iauders book though fivepointed instead of seven a dragon fly with some fainter characters A grotesque group probably a French caricatureis two eels and two birds perhaps intended for herons  Other impressions taken by me on paper and mounted on card board show a small star of the same character as before given but fivepointed some faint designs resembling those of Iauder but not identical an animal supposed to be a bear an aboriginal head and bust a very artistic moose and a cluster of three trees diMer entiated at their roots and conjectured by comparison with a Pas samaquoddy inscription to signify the first second and third chiefs of the tribe  In connection with the scratchings on the soft and polished surface of the rock which seems to invite them the thought occurs that the art of picturing and subsequently of writing is in all parts of the world determined by the ready and convenient material as for instance the papyrus of the Egyptian and parchments in other parts of the ancient world the hides of deer or buffalo among the hunting tribes of this country But the most tempting and con venient of all material appears to have been the birchbark which is found generally through the whole of the northern Algonkin region This can be used in two entirely distinct modesone in which outlines are drawn by any hardpointed substallce on the inner side of the bark when it is soft and which remains indelibly when dry the other made by scraping on the rougher outer sur face thus producing a difference in GQlqr The New Navat Observatory The contract for the erection of the new Naval Observatory buildings on Georgetown Heights near Washington has been awarded by the secretary of the navy for 3078I I This contract does not cover the piers or the domes svhich are to be built by ex perts under the direct supervision of

small launch to be run by an electromotor supplied with electricity from secondary batterles The launch has no fea tures of especial novelty exceptirg the fact that it is the first boat propelled by stored electricity that has been used in this country A full charge of the battery will take her about eighty miles and she can be more easily controlled than an ordinary launch besides being noiseless and free from heat and dtrt In speed weight and the distance she can go she compares favorably with steam launches of the same size while in point of comfort she would far surpass them There is a field for these boats at present on men ofwar for general use or for torpedoboats for which last purpose their rloiselessness makes them especially valuable They couldfCE in the resistance of the cell so the effect of the light must be to cause a variation in the electromotisre force be used too on larger yachts and for pleasureboats by those who can afforl them and where there are facilities for reaching the battery An important use just at present is to call attention to the possibilities of storagebatteries and to encourage inventors to im prove the present uneconomical and weighty types The launch in question is twentyeight feet long has six feet beam and a depth of three feet The batteries are under a couple of benches running fore and aft The motors are under the deck aft The motors are gover1led by a handle near the steeringwheel With sevenhorse power the hoat is said to make twelve miles with twollorse power about six miles an hour COST OF ELECTRIC TRACTIONThe following

then storagecars would provided the estinAate be cor rect be much cheaper than any other system Fortunately these tig ures will have a practical test since the Jtllien Company is equipping ten storagecars for the line So much for storagecarsj Where overhead wires are permissible there seems llo doubt of the ad xrantages of electric traction The Union Passenger Railway in Richmond with the Sprague system is carrying over 250000 passengers a month at a cost of less than IA cents a carmile the total operating expellses every thing included being only 47 per cent of the receipts 07hat electric railway systems using a conduit between the tracks for their conductor can do remains to be seen For haulage in mines the reports ale most encouraging Mr Shaefer at a meeting of the Engineers Club of Philadelphia stated that the cost per tonmile in the anthracitecoal mines was as follows mules I82 cents steam 6 cent electric motors 4 to 67 cent Consielering the very obvious advantages of electricity as compared with steam in miningwork the figures are strollgly in tEavor of electricity for traction in mines Outside of cost elec tricity presents the advantages of cleanliness and perfect control and the above figures taken in two cases from actual anl continued experience show that when properly applied it is superior in econ omy as well IIGHTNINGFLASHES W Kohlrausch has estimated the cur rent and quantity of electricity in a lightningflash He calculates that it will take 9200 amperes lo melt a copper rod of 25 centi metres diameter Such a current concentrated in a flash would contain from 52 to 270 coulonlbs which would decompose from 5 to 25 milligrams of water and form 9 to 45 cubic centimetres of explosive gas If this energy were stored up and distributed for electriclighting it would requile from 7 to 35 flashes to keep one incandescent lamp lighted ior an hour AN ELECTROCHEMICAL RADIOPHONE The Lonsdon EZec raczan gives an abstract of a communication to the AcadErnie des Sciences by MM Chaperon and Mercadier describing a galvanic cell made by them which is sensitive to the action of light  It consists of a plate of bright silver covered by the electrolysis of sulphate of sodium with a thin layer of sulphide of silver immersed tn some electrolyte other than an alkaline sulphide water contain ang a trace of sulphuric acid being as good as any thing The electromotive force is feeble and variable and the cell polarizes rapidly but its current undergoes an instantaneous change when exposed to daylight or even to weak artificial light The authors investigated the rapidity of action by exposing the cell to the beam of the oxyhydrogen light made intermittent by passing through a revolving wheel pierced with holes A telephone was included in the battery circuit and sounds were produced so high in the scale as to correspond to more than IOOO vibrations a second which showed that the electrochemical effect must be produced in less tthan k of a second No corresponding change was produced EXPERIMENTS ON THE ELECTRIC ARC The fall of potential in the electric arc has been generally held to be due to tnvo causes a resistance increasing with the length of the arc and a counter electromotive force independent of the length This may be ex pressed by the formula E bS where a and b are constants and Z is the length of the arc Dr Lecher in a paper in the Cen traZbZaXtfsgr LEecZroZecAngk describes experiments svhich tend to disprove this view tIe first found that the resistance of the arc does not increase very rapidly when it is extinguished this he showed by putting the primary of an inductioncoil in the arclamp circuit first pulling the carbons apart and second extinguishing the lamp There was a spark in the secondary in the first case but not in the second so the resistance on extinction could not have in creased svith very great rapidity This being the case Dr Lecher placed in the lampcircuit a galvanometer the needle held against a stop for the direct current but free to swing in the opposite direction He then suddenly cut out the feedingcurrent and there was no swing of the galvanometerneedle in the opposite direction so if there was a counter electromotive force in the arc it must have disappeared at the same time the feedingcurrent ceased To see if the difference of potential of the arc depends on the temperature of the carbons they were heated by a blowpipe With a normal difference of 42 volts this rose to 48 volts when the positive and 52 volts when the negative carbon was heated When the carbons are horizontal the potential difference is less than when they are vertical on account of the higher temperature in the latter case When the carbons are cooled the potential difference is less For example representing the difference by abS bG 45S 5 7 sog Carbons horizontal uncooled  33 vertical i  355  horizontal cooled 25 i I 5 VO tS i I5 i3o  To find in what part of the arc the fall of potential really occurred a carbon rod of small diameter was introduced into the arc and the difference of potential between it and the carbon electrodes was taken It was found that the difference of potential between the carbon and azy part of the arc was about 36 volts This being the case it is assumed that the rest of the fall of potential is at the carbon Dr Lecher also experimented on the nature of the cur rent forming the arc but the method used is questiollable He claims that his investigations shosv I The existence of a back electromotive force is doubtful 2 The difference of potential is affected by temperature 3 If the negative electrode is platinum or iron the discharge is discontinuous THE RADIOMICROPHONEMr C Vernon Boys has de scribed before the Royal Society an instrument for measuring very small changes of temperature 6 It is an extremely delicate form of thermopile consisting of a square frame made of one turn of one square centimetre of which three sides are thin copper wire and the fourth is a compound bar of antimony and bismuth each piece being 5 x 5xW mm soldered edge to edge This frame is sup ported by a thin rod to which is fastened a mirror and the whole is hung by a tortion fibre in the field of a powerful magnet When radient energy falls on the centre of the compound bar the frame is deflected and the amount of deflection measures the energy Adopting suitable dimensions and using a very strong field an in strument may be made capable of showing a change of tempera ture of the junction of one thousandmillionth of a degree

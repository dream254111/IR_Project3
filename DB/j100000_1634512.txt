AIMJS IN THE TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY GEOMETRY HISTORIC ALLY CONSIDERED1 THE two educational aims that have stood out distinctly in the history of the teaching of geometry are the practical2 and the logical Of course in the early development of geom etry the term teaching can not be used with its modern significance The practical side of geometry was developed by the Babylonians the Egyptians and the Romans the logical by the Greeks In the medieval universities the little geometry taught was according to Euclid England has followed the same standard to the present day The other European countries for the most part have combined both of these aims and this obtains today with the empha 1See the authors A History of the Teaching of Elementary Geometry Teachers College Con tributions to Education No 23 for the original and secondary sources consulted The present article is not an integral part of the larger work but material from the latter is utilized in the former 23The term practical is used with reference to the applications of geometry within the field of mathematics or in the related fields of science sis on the logical The same is true in the United States A third aim in the teaching of geometry arose when the secondary schools began to assume the character of preparatory schools for the universities The last hundred years have seen this generally brought about and within the last fifty years it has been fully systematized in the various countries In treating these several aims it is impossible to completely separate them The early Egyptians and Babylonians de veloped geometry as a means toward a prac tical end Both nations were interested in astronomy and hence a rudimentary geometry found a place with them The Egyptians em ployed geometric principles in the building of their pyramids and in surveying They meas ured lengths and areas they built solids of regular design they showed some skill in geometric drawing in their mural decorations With all this they experienced the necessary propaedeutics for a developed science yet this development never came Whether it was the lack of Godgiven powers or due to the con servatism of the priestly class that sacredly guarded the learning one can only conjecture The Romans also valued geometry for its utility employing it in architecture and in surveying But unlike the Egyptians they had the learning of other nations to draw upon This development in architecture and surveying was marked in the first century be fore and the first century after Christ Euclid had written his Elements approximately three hundred years earlier Archimedes had already developed geometry as applied to me chanics and Heron of Alexandria who studied and wrote on practical geometry and survey ing lived in the early years of this Roman  period The work of Heron influenced the Roman surveyors but Euclid found little favor with the Romans When the  Ele ments  was recognized at all it was that it might be of aid in the training of the orator which was for the Romans a practical aim In like manner the Hindus and Arabians studied geometry primarily for its practical value although both of these nations were largely dependent upon the Greeks for their knowledge of geometry SCIENCE 701N S VOL XXX No 777 The nations that have been considered thus far emphasized only the practical side of geometry and we find with them no plan of education that provided for its systematic in struction The early Christian schools taught geometry in a small way but the practical was almost entirely neglected The medieval uni versities made provision for the applications of geometry but such work was independent of Euclid The Greeks were the first nation that de veloped and consistently taught a logical sys tem of geometry Although they were inter ested in astronomy and the physical sciences which undoubtedly stimulated their study of geometry yet the practical was completely divorced from the logical as is shown in the text of Euclid The chief function of educa tion according to the old Greek idea was the perfection of the human being body and soul Hence gymnastics and music constituted almost entirely the program of studies for the growing boy When the new education with its philosophy and mathematics entered into the Greek life it served as the completion of an edifice whose foundations had already been laid Hence the logic of geometry thrived in Greece But in the development of this sci ence the Greeks were stimulated by a sort of practical aim in attempting to solve the three famous problems of antiquity the quadrature of the circle the duplication of the cube and the trisection of any angle In the actual teaching of the subject however the Greeks were more interested in the chain of reasoning than in the subjectmatter itself Logical geometry next found a place in the medieval universities Under the influence of monasticism and mysticism the church schools were more interested in religious than in intel lectual things Then scholasticism arose and dominated European education from the eleventh to the fifteenth century It sought  to bring reason to the support of faith and logical inquiry was stimulated The univer sities began their careers under such influences and when Euclid became known to medieval Europe it found a place in the curricula of these institutions where it was taught in the highest class Undoubtedly it was looked upon as the instrument that completed and knit together the logical faculties of the mind The universities did not neglect science In particular the sphaera was studied but it bore no relation to the logical study of geom etry A thing for us to remember is that these institutions followed the example set by the Greeks Geometry and the physical sciences were both studied but the former was devel oped without any reference to the latter In the teaching of geometry the different European countries have held to the strictly logical in varying degree Italy has Euclidean traditions but England above all has taught geometry primarily on the logical basis Euclid has there reigned supreme Until re cent years English higher education has meant the education that fits for the socalled higher callings The public schools which prepare largely for the universities have had this same conception Any training that smacked of trade was not considered to be a part of the education of an English gentleman The result has been that the classical side has been particularly emphasized and practical educa tion has been almost neglected In recent years the modern university movement in England has furthered technical and industrial education and we now find secondary and higher technical schools that are beginning to fill this gap in the English school system Thus far we have mentioned the marked tendencies among certain nations and institu tions to hold either to the practical or the logical in the teaching of geometry With reference to other nations Germany and France for instance have never held to the rigors of Euclid and Russia has begun only in comparatively recent years to emphasize the scientific teaching of geometry Let us look into the aims in some of those countries where the extremes of aim have not been so disasso ciated The Renaissance of the fifteenth and six teenth centuries brought no change in the teaching of mathematics in the universities This result could hardly be expected from a movement entirely classical in its nature It was not until the latter part of the seventeenth century under the influence of realism that 702 SCIENCENOVEMBER 19 1909 the universities began to change the character of their work and modern science was in cluded in the curricula The geometry taught in the secondary schools of Germany up to the seventeenth century was taught largely in con nection with astronomy and surveying copied after the work done in some of the medieval schools The logical aim became more promi nent by the beginning of the eighteenth cen tury when science began to assume its more modern form In Russia geometry was first taught from the practical standpoint The logical aim was long in getting recognition It was not until the end of the eighteenth century that geom etry received any great attention as a science In France the early texts show that the prac tical in geometry was valued as well as the logical In Holland the beginning was prac tical the eighteenth century marking a more logical trend when the teaching was made systematic In the United States the first geometry taught was of a practical nature but the English influence was soon felt and it was not until the first quarter of the nine teenth century that the more practical geom etry of the French began to replace the Eng lish Euclids Another aim has characterized the teaching of geometry an aim different from the two already considered but still not standing apart from them It is associated with the study of geometry as a preparation for advanced work in mathematics This aim is a recent one in the teaching of geometry Before the latter part of the eighteenth century in no strict sense could the secondary schools that have here been considered be called preparatory schools for the higher institutions It was not until 1788 that the Prussian government required an examination from all who entered the universities and it seems that this was not at first rigidly enforced One may safely judge that previous to 1788 the aim of preparing for advanced study was not a dominant one in the gymnasia On the creation of the lyeees in France by INapoleon in 1802 these schools began to assume the character of preparatory schools for the uni versity and the various government schools In England the secondary schools did not be gin to teach Euclid until the early part of the last century and it was not required in gen eral until about the middle of that century It has been only within fifty years that these schools have in any strict sense prepared for the universities In Russia students at first passed from the seminaries and the ecclesias tical academies into the universities but in 1759 the gymnasia began to act as preparatory schools The secondary schools of Holland began to prepare for the university in 1815 but as far as geometry was concerned the re quirements were not strictly defined In the United States the universities did not require geometry for entrance before 1844 Since that date the high schools have assumed more and more the function of preparing students for advanced work in the universities One of the results of this close relation be tween the university and the secondary school has been an improvement in the teaching of geometry from the scientific standpoint but in the United States at least while the teach ing of geometry has been better developed logically its practical side has been corre spondingly neglected in the high schools ALVA WALKER STAMPER CHICo CAL A NEW NAME FOR A NEW SCIEYCE1 THE following list though noticeably brief attempts to include all books and memoirs in which the facts of history of a

FP R S READ MAY 30 1799 XVHE N MR CORSE DID ME THE HONOUR OF PUTTING INTO MY HANDS HIS OBSERVATIONS ON THE ELEPHANTS TEETH AND SHEWED ME THE TEETH THEMSELVES IN THEIR DIFFERENT STAGES OF GROWTH IN ILLUSTRATION OF WHAT HE HAD ADVANCED UPON THE SUBJECT I VERY READILY ENGAGED IN THE PROSECUTION OF SO CURIOUS AN INVESTIGATION I EXAMINED SEVERAL SPECIMENS OF ELEPHANTS TETH PRESERVED IN SPIRIT WHILE IN A GROWING STATE WHICH ARE DEPOSITED IN MR HUNTERS COLLECTION OF COMPARATIVE ANATOMY AND COMPARED THEM WITH THE TEETH IN MR CORSES POSSESSION FROM THESE TWO SOURCES I WAS ENABLED TO PROCURE EVERY INFORMATION THAT WAS REQUIRED TO EXPLAIN THE STRUCTURE OF THE ELEPHANTS TEETH AND TO POINT OUT THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE UPON WHICH ALL TEETH ARE FORMED THAT HAVE THE ENAMEL INTERMIXED WITH THE SUBSTANCE OF THE TEETH A SUBJECT AS FAR AS I AM ACQUAINTED NOT HITHERTO INVESTIGATED THE SUCCESS THAT HAS ATTENDED THIS INQUIRY MAY BE ASCRIBED TO MY OPPORTUNITIES OF CONSULTING MR HUNTERS COLLECTION THIS TRIBUTE I PAY WITH MUCH SATISFACTION AND MENTION IT HERE IN PROOF OF THE VALUE OF THAT COLLECTION WHICH IS NOT CONFINED TO THE DISCOVERIES AND INVESTIGATIONS OF MRM HUNTER BUT EXTENDS MDCCXCIX I I2ET8 MR HOMES OBSERVATIONS ON THE STRUCTURE OF MUCH FURTHER SINCE THE COLLECTION CONTAINS MATERIALS RELATING TO MANY SUBJECTS AT PRESENT BUT LITTLE UNDERSTOOD AND WHICH IF THEY ARE HEREAFTER RENDERED ACCESSIBLE TO THOSE ENGAGED IN SUCH RESEARCHES WILL LEAD TO THE 4DVANCEMENT OF KNOWLEDGE AND TO MANY USEFUL DISCOVERIES AS MR CORSES LABOURS IN INDIA HAVE ENABLED HIM TO GIVE SO CORRECT AND SATISFACTORY AN ACCOUNT OF THE MODE OF GROWTH OF THE ELEPHANTS TEETH I WAS DESIROUS THAT THE FACTS WHICH I HAD DISCOVERED RESPECTING THEIR STRUCTURE SHOULD BE INTRODUCED INTO HIS PAPER TO RENDER THE ACCOUNT TMORE COMPLETETHIS OFFER MR CORSE HOWEVER DECLINED NOT CHOOSIN G TO BRING FORWARD ANY THING THAT WAS NOT WHOLLY HIS OWN I HAVE THEREFORE ADDED THEM IN THIS PLACE AS A PROPER SUPPLEMENT TO MR CORSES PAPER TO MAKE MY OBSERVATIONS ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE COMPLEX TOOTH OF THE ELEPHANT INTELLIGIBLE TO THIS LEARNED SOCIETY IT AP PEARS NECESSARY TO MENTION GENERALLY THE MODE IN WHICH THE MORE SIMPLE TEETH OF THE HUMAN SPECIES AND OF CARNIVOROUS ANI MALS ARE FORMED THIS KNOWLEDGE WILL RENDER THE ACCOUNT OF SUCH ADDITIONAL PARTS AS ARE MET WITH IN THOSE OF THE ELEPHANT MORE EASILY UNDERSTOOD THE TEETH OF CARNIVOROUS ANIMALS ARE FORMED FROM A VASCULAR PULP OF THE SAME SHAPE WITH THE FUTURE TOOTH UPON THE EXTER NAL SURFACE OF WHICH THE SUBSTANCE OF THE TOOTH BEGINS TO GROW AND INCREASES TILL IT IS COMPLETELY FORMED THIS PULP IS INCLOSED BY A CAPSULE THE CAVITY OF WHICH WHILE THE TOOTH IS GROWING IS FILLED WITH A VISCID FLUID SIMILAR TO THE SYNOVIA OF JOINTS  AND THIS FLUID BY THE ABSORPTION OF THE THINNER PARTS BECOMES INSPISSATED TO A PROPER STATE FOR CRYSTALLIZATION SO AS TO FORM THE ENAMEL WHICH ADHERES TO THE SURFACE OF THE TOOTHTHE TEETH OF GRARNINIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS TEETH FORMED IN THIS WAY ARE COMPOSED OF TWO PARTS OF DIS SIMILAR TEXTURE ONE THE ENAMEL WHICH IS STRIATED THE OTHER THE SUBSTANCE OF THE TOOTH WHICH IS LAMINATED LIKE IVORY BE ING MORE COMPACT THAN COMMON BONE AND LESS SO THAN THE ENAMEL BUT DIFFERING FROM BOTH IN THE MODE OF ITS FORMATION BONES ARE FORMED IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS THOSE THAT ARE CYST LINDRICAL HAVE CARTILAGE FOR THEIR BASIS THOSE THAT ARE FLAT EITHER CARTILAGE OR MEMBRANE BUT IN NO INSTANCE IN THE BODY ARE THEY FORMED UPON A PULP THE SUBSTANCE OF THE TOOTH MUST THEREFORE BE CONSIDERED AS DISTINCT FROM BONE AND MAY BE RANK ED BOTH FROM ITS STRUCTURE AND MODE OF FORMATION AS A SPECIES OF IVORY THE TEETH OF THE ELEPHANT DIFFER FROM THOSE JUST DESCRIBED IN BEING COMPOSED OF A GREAT MANY FLATTENED OVAL PROCESSES THESE WHILE GROWING ARE DETACHED BUT WHEN COMPLETELY FORMED THEIR BASES UNITE TOGETHER AND MAKE THE BODY OF THE TOOTH TO WHICH THE FANGS ARE AFTERWARDS ADDED AND AS THE FANGS ARE LENGTH ENED THE TOOTH RISES IN THE JAW THIS IS WHAT MAY BE CONSIDERED AS THE TOOTH ITSELF BEING COMPOSED OF THE SAME MATERIALS AS THE TEETH OF CARNIVOROUS ANIMALS BUT IN ADDITION THERE IS ANOTHER SUBSTANCE WHICH UNITES ALL THE PROCESSES TOGETHER LATERALLY INTO ONE MASS THIS IS SOFTER THAN THE SUBSTANCE OF THE TOOTH AND UPON EXAMINATION PROVES TO BE SIMILAR IN ITS TEXTURE AND FORMA TION TO COMMON BONE  THE TUSKS OF THE ELEPHANT ARE FORMED UPON A PLLP SIMILAR TO TEETH TUMORS ARE SOMETIMES MET WITH IN THE FRONTAL SINUSES OF THE HUMAN BODY HAVING A PERFECT RESEMBLANCE TO IVORY THEY HAVE THEIR ORIGIN IN THE BONY CAVITY OF THE SINUS AND EXTEND THEMSELVES INTO THE ORBIT OF THE EYE OF THESE I HAVE SEEN TWO INSTANCES AND WAS UNABLE AT THE TIME TO ACCOUNT FOR THEM BUT AM NOW INDUCED TO BELIEVE THEY WERE FORMED UPON VASCULAR EXCRESCENCES GROWING FROM THE LININSG OF THE SINUSES SIMILAR IN THEIR ORGANIZATION TO THE PULPS ABOVE MENTIONED I 21240 MR HOMES OBSERVATIONS ON TBE STRUCTURE OF AS TEETH HAVE BEEN HITHERTO CONSIDERED OF THE SAME TEXTURE WITH COMMON BONE IT IS PROBABLE THAT NOTHING BUT THE TWO SUBSTANCES BEING UNITED IN THE SAME MASS COULD HAVE LED ME TO THE DISCOVERY OF THEIR DIFFERING MATERIALLY FROM EACH OTHER ITWILL THEREFORE BE PROPER TO EXPLAIN IN THIS PLACE FHE CI CUMSTANCES WHICH FIRST GAVE ME THE PRESENT VIEW OF THE SUB JECT TO OBTAIN AN ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE ELEPHANTS TOOTH A LONGITUDINAL SECTION WAS MADE OF ONE THAT WAS FULL GROWN THIS SECTION EXPOSED THE LATERAL CONNECTION BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT PROCESSES AND THE INTERMEDIATE SUBSTANCE WHICH UNITES THEM INTO ONE MASS IT ALSO SHOWED THE MODE IN WHICH THE PROCESSES ARE CONTINUED INTO THE BODY OF THE TOOTH AND FANGS THAT THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE MIGHT BE MADE MORE DISTINCT THE SURFACE OF THIS SECTION WAS POLISHED VERY HIGHLY WHICH LED TO THE DISCOVERY OF THE PROCESSES OF THE TOOTH HAVING A MORE COMPACT TEXTURE THAN THE INTERMEDIATE SUBSTANCE FOR ALTHOUGH BOTH HAD THE SAME APPEARANCE AFTER BEING SAWN THE PROCESSES BORE A POLISH WHICH THE OTHER DID NOT AND WERE LAMINATED LIKE IVORY WHILE THE OTHER PARTS WERE POROUS LIKE THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF COMMON BONE THIS LED ME TO EXAMINE PREPARATIONS OF THE ELEPHANTS TEETH IRL A GROWING STATE PRESERVED IN SPIRIT WHICH EXPLAINED THE MODE OF GROWTH OF THESE TWO SUBSTANCES TO BE DIFFERENT IN THESE PREPA  A PORTION OF THE JAW ITSELF BORE THE SAME DEGREE OF POLISH AS THE INTERMEDIATE SUBSTANCE OF THE TOOTH THE CELLS IN THE ELEPHANTS SKULL ARE NO PART OF ITS COMMON STRUCTURE THEY COMMU NICATE FREELY WITH THE CAVITY OF THE TYMPANUM AND ARE THEREFORE APPENDAGES TO THE ORGAN OF HEARING WHICH I SHALL EXPLAIN MORE FULLY ON SOME FUTURE OCCASIONTHE TEETH OF GRAMRNINVOROUS QUADRUPEDS 241 RATIONS IT WAS FOUND THAT THE PROCESSES OF THE TOOTH WHICH MAY BE CALLED IVORY WERE ALL FORMED UPON SO MANY PORTIONS OF ONE COMMON PULP WHICH HAD ITS ORIGIN IN THE JAW AND THAT THE INTERMEDIATE SUBSTANCE WHICH MAY BE CALLED BONE WAS FORMED UPON A SPECIES OF LIGAMENT SITUATED IMMEDIATELY UNDER THE GUM FROM WHICH MEMBRANOUS ELONGATIONS EXTENDED INTO THE SPACES BETWEEN THE PROCESSES OF THE TOOTH AS THIS IS A SUBJECT NOT FAVOURABLE FOR MINUTE DESCRIPTION THE ANNEXED DRAWINGS WILL GIVE A MORE SATISFACTORY IDEA OF WHAT IS MEANT TO BE DESCRIBED THAN CAN READILY BE DONE IN WORDS IN THESE DRAWINGS IS REPRESENTED THE LIGAMENTOUS SUBSTANCE WITH ITS PROJECTING MEMBRANES AND THE VASCULAR PULPS ALSO THE MODE IN WHICH THE OSSIFICATION TAKES PLACE IN THE ONE AND THE FORMATION OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE TOOTH IN THE OTHER THIS STRUCTURE OF TOOTH IS NOT PECULIAR TO THE ELEPHANT BUT COMMON TO THE TEETH OF ALL ANIMALS WHOSE FOOD REQUIRES TO BE GROUND OR MUCH BRUISED BEFORE IT IS SWALLOWED IN THE ELEPHANTS TOOTH FROM THE LARGENESS OF ITS SIZE THE PARTS ARE MORE DISTINCT AND MORE READILY CONTRASTED WITH EACH OTHER BUT IN OTHER ANIMALS EVEN THOSE OF A SMALL SIZE AS THE SHEEP THE DIFFERENT STRUCTURES ARE READILY DETECTED IT IS SINGULARI THAT THIS STRUCTURE SHOULD HAVE ESCAPED THE AC4 CURATE INVESTIGATION OF THE LATE MR HUNTER PARTICULARLY AS THE FORMATION OF THE TEETH WAS ONE OF THE FIRST OBJECTS HE EMPLOYED HIMSELF UPON AND HE CONTINUED TO PURSUE IT TO THE END OF HIS LIFE MARKING THE VARIETIES WHICH OCCUR IN DIFFERENT ANIMALS THE CAUSE OF HIS OVERLOOKING IT WAS THE FOLLOWING IN MAKING PREPARATIONS OF HORSES TEETH TO SHOW THE FIGURED APPEARANCE ON THE GRINDING SURFACE HE RENDERED THEM BLACK BY MEANS OF FIRE WHICH DID NOT AFFECT THE ENAMEL SO THAT THE WHITE LINES OF THEACIS MR HOMES OBSERVATIONS ON THE STRUCTURE OF ENAMEL WERE BEAUTIFULLY DISTINCT ON THE BLACK GROUND BUT THE BONY PART AND THE SUBSTANCE OF THE TOOTH WERE EQUALLY COLOUR ED AND HAD AN UNIFORM APPEARANCE THE EXAMINATION OF THESE PREPARATIONS LED HIM TO BELIEVE THAT THE HORSES TOOTH CONSISTED OF ONLY TWO SUBSTANCES THE TOOTH ITSELF AND THE ENAMEL UNDER THIS IMPRESSION MR HUNG TER EXAMINED THE GROWING TEETH OF THE HORSE AND FOUND THE PULP RISING FROM THE JAW AND THE VASCULAR MEMBRANES PASSING DOWN FROM THE GUM INTO THE SPACES BETWEEN THE PORTIONS OF PULP HE WAS THEREFORE LED TO CONCLUDE THAT THE PULP WAS FOR THE FORMATION OF THE TOOTH AND THAT THE MEMBRANES WHICH CAME FROM THE GUM WERE FOR THE FORMATION OF THE ENAMEL HAVING SO FULLY EXPLAINED IN THE ELEPHANTS TOOTH THE REAL USES OF THESE TWO PARTS IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO SAY MORE IN RE FUTATION OF THIS OPINION WHICH IS PUBLISHED IN MR HUNTERS WORK ON THE TEETH BUT IN JUSTICE TO THE CORRECTNESS OF HIS OTHER OBSERVATIONS I SHALL SUBJOIN HIS ACCOUNT OF THE CIRCUM STANCES UNDER WHICH THE ENAMEL OF THE HUMAN TEETH IS FORMED TAKEN FROM THE SAME WORK HE SAYS  THE PULPS ARE SURROUNDED BY A MEMBRANE WHICH IS NOT CONNECTED WITH THEM EXCEPT AT THEIR ROOT OR SURFACE OF ADHESION THIS MEMBRANE ADHERES BY ITS OUTER SURFACE ALL ROUND THE BONY CAVITY IN THE JAW  AND ALSO TO THE GUM WHERE IT COVERS THE ALVEOLI WHEN THE PULP IS VERY YOUNG AS IN THE FOETUS OF SIX OR SEVEN MONTHS THIS MEMBRANE IS PRETTY THICK AND GELATINOUS WE CAN EXAMINE IT BEST IN A NEWBORN CHILD AND WE FIND IT MADE UP OF TWO LAMELLE AN EXTERNAL AND AN INTERNAL THE EXTERNAL IS SOFT AND SPONGY WITHOUT ANY VESSELS THE OTHER IS MUCH FIRMER AND EXTREMELY VASCULAR ITS VESSELS COMING FROM THOSE THAT ARE GOING TO THE PULP AND BODY OF THE TOOTHTHE TEETH OF GRAMINIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS 243 WHILE THE TEETH ARE WITHIN THE GUM THERE IS ALWAYS A MUCIA LAGINOUS FLUID LIKE THE SYNOVIA IN JOINTS BETWEEN THIS MEM BRANE AND THE PULP OF THE TOOTH  THIS MUCILAGINOUS FLUID I HAVE ALREADY ASSERTED DEPOSITS THE ENAMEL WHICH IS FURTHER CONFIRMED BY THE FOLLOWING EXPERBT MENTS AND OBSERVATIONS THE COMPLEX TOOTH OF THE ELEPHANT BEING COMPOSED OF THREE DIFFERENT STRUCTURES EACH OF WHICH HAS A PECULIAR PROCESS FOR ITS FORMATION LED TO AN INQUIRY WHETHER THE MATERIALS THEMSELVES WERE DIFFERENT OR ONLY DIFFERENTLY ARRANGED TO INVESTIGATE THIS MR CHARLES HATCHETT FROM A ZEAL TO PROMOTE THE PURSUITS OF SCIENCE BY WHICH HE IS DISTINGUISHED OBLIGINGLY GAVE HIS ASSISTANCE AND MADE SOME EXPERIMENTS THE RESULTS OF WHICH ARE AS FOLLOWS IT IS TO BE UNDERSTOOD THAT A COMPLETE ANALYSIS WAS NEVER INTENDED TO BE MADE AS NEITHER MR HATCHETTS TIME ADMITTED OF IT NOR DID IT APPEAR NECESSARY FOR THE OBJECT OF THE PRESENT INQUIRY EXPERIMENT I SOME ENAMEL RASPED INTO A FINE POWDER WAS PUT INTO A MATRASS AND PURE MURIATIC ACID BEING ADDED THE WHOLE WAS SUFFERED TO REMAIN WITHOUT THE APPLICATION OF HEAT DURING ONE HOUR IN THE COURSE OF THIS TIME THE ENAMEL WAS COMPLETELY DISSOLVED WITH A GENTLE EFFERVESCENCE TO THIS SOLUTION SOME SULPHURIC ACID WAS GRADUALLY ADDED TILL ALL PRECIPITATION HAD CEASED THE PRECIPITATE WAS SEPARATED BY A FILTER AND WAS FOUND TO BE SELENITE THE FILTRATED LIQUOR BY EVAPORATION AFFORDED A SMALL ADDITIONAL QUANTITY OF SELENITE WHICH WAS ALSO SEPARATED AFTER WHICH THE LIQUOR BEING EVAPO PORATED BECAME THICK AND VISCID THIS WHEN DILUTED WITH241 MR HOMES OBSERVATIONS ON THE STRACTURE OF WATER PRECIPITATED LIME FROM LIME WATER IN THE STATE OF PHOST PHATE TO ANOTHER PORTION SOLUTION OF ACETITE OF LEAD WAS ADDED AND CAUSED AN IMMEDIATE PRECIPITATION OF A WHITE MATTER WHICH WHEN DRIED AND SPRINKLED ON BURNING CHARCOAL PRODUCED A LIGHT AND SMELL LIKE PHOSPHORUS IT MOREOVER WAS SOLUBLE IN NITROUS ACID AND WAS THUS TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM MURIATE OR SULPHATE OF LEAD EXPERIMENT XI SOME OF THE RASPINGS OF ENAMEL WERE DIS SOLVED BY DIGESTION IN NITRIC ACID AND WHEN THE SOLUTION HAD BEEN DILUTED AND FILTRATED IT WAS SATURATED WITH CARBONATE OF AMMONIAC THE PRECIPITATE THUS PRODUCED WAS COLLECTED AND EDULCORATED IN A FILTER THE SMALL EXCESS OF CARBONATE OF AMMO NIAC IN THE FILTRATED LIQUOR WAS SATURATED WITH ACETOUS ACID AFTER WHICH THE PHOSPHORIC ACID WAS PRECIPITATED BY SOLUTION OF ACETITE OF LEAD UPON EXAMINING THE FIRST PRECIPITATE OR THAT PRODUCED BY THE CARBONATE OF AMMONIAC IT WAS FOUND CONTRARY TO EX PECTATION THAT IT WAS STILL COMPOSED OF LIME COMBINED WITH A PORTION OF PHOSPHORIC ACID INSTEAD OF CARBONIC ACID WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN SUPPOSED TO EFFECT THEREFORE A COMPLETE SEPARATION OF THE TWO INGRE DIENTS LIME AND PHOSPHORIC ACID ACETOUS ACID WAS POURED ON THE PRECIPITATE BY WHICH IT WAS IMMEDIATELY DISSOLVED THE WHOLE OF THE PHOSPHORIC ACID WAS THEN SEPARATED FROM THIS SO LUTION BY ACETITE OF LEAD AFTER WHICH LEST ANY LEAD SHOULD BE PRESENT THE LIQUOR WAS SATURATED WITH PURE OR CAUSTIC AMMONIAC AND THE LEAD WAS SEPARATED BY A FILTER LASTLY THE LIME WHICH REMAINED DISSOLVED WAS PRECIPITATED IN THE STATE OF CARBONATE BY CARBONATE OF AMIMONIAC THE ENAMEL HAS BEEN SUPPOSED NOT A PHOSPHATE BUT A CARTHE TEETH OF GRAMINIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS BONATE OF LIME THIS ERROR MAY HAVE ARISEN FROM ITS SOLUBILITY IN ACETOUS ACID OR DISTILLED VINEGAR BUT THE EFFECTS OF THE ACETOUS ACID ARE IN EVERY RESPECT THE SAME ON POWDERED BONE AS ON THE ENAMEL CONSEQUENTLY WHEN ENAMEL OR BONE IS PUT INTO A GLASS MATRASS CONTAINING ACETOUS ACID PLACED IN A SAND BATH THE PORTION WHICH IS DISSOLVED IS KNOT AS HAS BEEN SUPPOSED CARBONATE BUT PHOSPHATE OF LIME FOR IF TO THE FILTRATED SOLUTION NITRATE OR ACETITE OF LEAD IS ADDED A PRECIPITATE IS PRODUCED OF PHOSPHATE OF LEAD IN THE SAME MANNER AS WHEN NITRATE OR ACE TITE OF LEAD IS ADDED TO URINE THIS MODE OF TREATING SUBSTANCES SUPPOSED TO CONTAIN PHOS PHORIC ACID AS BONE C MR HATCHETT HAS FOUND OF GREAT UTILITY BECAUSE BY THIS MEANS HE CAN DETECT PHOSPHORIC ACID WHEN THE SUBSTANCE IS IN TOO SMALL A QUANTITY TO BE EXAMINED IN ANY OTHER MANNER SIMILAR EXPERIMENTS ON THE SUBSTANCE OF TEETH FORMED ON PULPS AND ON COMMON BONE AFFORDED SIMILAR RESULTS MR HIATCHETT CONSIDERS LIME AND PHOSPHORIC ACID TO BE THE ESSENTIALLY CONSTITUENT PRINCIPLES OF THESE THREE DIFFERENT STRUCTURES AND ANY DIFFERENCE THAT IS MET WITH ONLY SEEMS TO BE THAT WHICH WOULD CONSTITUTE SPECIES OF THE SAME GENUS SIMI LAR TO WHAT IS FOUND IN THE MINERAL KINGDOM UNDER LIMESTONE MARBLE AND CALCAREOUS SPAR  THESE DIFFER ONLY BY A SMALL CHANGE IN THE PROPORTIONS OF THEIR CONSTITUENT PRINCIPLES AND BY A DIFFER RENT ARRANGEMENT OF THEIR INTEGRANT PARTICLES THE HEAD OF A HUMAN THIGH BONE WAS FOUND SOME YEARS AGO WITH A THIN CRUST OF HIGHLYPOLISHED ENAMEL SIMILAR IN SOME RE SPECTS TO THAT OF THE TEETH UPON A PORTION OF ITS SURFACE AN INCH ARND HALF IN LENGTH AND AN INCH IN BREADTH THE CARTILAGE HAVING MDCCXCIX K K246 MRI HOMES OBSERVATIONS  O THE STRUCTURE OF BEEN PREVIOUSLY REMOVED BY DISEASE THIS UNCOMMON APPEAR ANCE AT THE TIME COULD NOT BE ACCOUNTED FOR BUT THE FORE MENTIONED OBSERVATIONS ON THE FORMATION OF THE ENAMEL OF THE TEETH APPEARED TO THROW SOME LIGHT UPON IT AND MR HATCHETT AT MY REQUEST MADE THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENT TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE SYNOVIA IN A HEALTHY STATE CONTAINS PHOSPHATE OF LIME  960 GRAINS OF SYNOVIA BY A GRADUAL EVAPORATION AFFORDED 2 GRAINS OF A SUBSTANCE WHICH RESEMBLED DRIED GLUE THIS BEING COLLECTED WAS PUT INTO A SMALL PORCDIATN CRUCIBLE WHICH PLACED IN A LARGER CRUCIBLE WAS EXPOSED TOA RED HEAT DURING NEARLY AN HOUR THE MATTER IN THE PORCELAIN CRUCIBLE WAS MUCH REDUCED IN BULK AND APPEARED LIKE A GLAZING THINLY SPREAD ON THOSE PARTS OF THE CRUCIBLE WHICH HAD BEEN IN CONTACT WITH IT IN ITS FORMER STATE BOILING DISTILLED WATER WAS DIGESTED ON THE MATTER IN THE CRUD CIBLE FOR SOME TIME THIS WATER AFTERWARDS AFFORDED WITH ACE TITE OF LEAD A COPIOUS PRECIPITATE OF PHOSPHATE OF LEAD BUT NO APPEARANCE OF LIME COULD BE OBTAINED ON THE RESIDUUM IN THE CRUCIBLE ACETOUS ACID WAS DIGESTED WHICH WAS AFTERWARDS DIVIDED INTO TWO PORTIONS TO ONE OF THESE SOLUTION OF ACETITE OF LEAD WAS ADDED AND AS BEFORE AFFORDED A PLENTIFUL PRECIPITATION OFPHOSPHATE OF LEAD TO THE OTHER PORTION WAS ADDED OXALIC ACID BY WHICH A SMALL QUANTITY OF A PRECIPITATE W AS OBTAINED WHICH WAS AN OXALATE OF LIME PHOSPHATE OF LIME IS THEREFORE PRESENT IN SYNOVIA ALTHOUGH BUT IN A SMALL QUANTITY AND AS FROM THESE EXPERIMENTS THERE IS REASON TO BELIEVE THAT MORE PHOSPHORIC ACID WAS OBTAINEDTHE TEETH OF GRAMINIVOROUS QUADRPE DS 47 THAN WAS REQUISITE TO SATURATE THE LIME IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT PART OF IT WAS COMBINED IN THE SYNOVIA EITHER WITH SODA OR AM MONIAC AND THIS ACCOUNTS FOR THE PART DISSOLVED BY THE DISTILLED WATER M MARGUERON IN THE AIINALES DE CHIMIE VOL XIV PAGE 123 ESTIMATES THE PROPORTION OF WATER IN 288 GRAINS OF THE SYNOVIA OF AN OX AT 232 GRAINS THE OTHER INGREDIENTS THERE FORE AMOUNT TO 56 GRAINS BUT BY EVAPORATION MR HATCHETT OBTAINED FROM 96O GRAINS OF SYNOVIA ONLY 21 GRAINS OF RESIDUUMN WHICH PROVES THAT THE PROPORTION OF WATER IS MUCH GREATER FOR 56TO 288 IS AS 1 TO 5  BUT TO 960 IS AS I TO0571 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE PROPORTION OF WATER TO THE OTHER INGRESS DIENTS MAY NOT ALWAYS BE THE SAME M MARGUERON ALSO PROBABLY ESTIMATED THE ALBUMINOUS MATTERI C IN A MOIST STATE FOR WITHOUT ONE OF THESE SUPPOSITIONS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO RECONCILE SUCH A VERY GREAT DIFFERENCE BY THESE EXPERIMENTS OF MR HATCHIETT PHOSPHATE OF LIME WAS ASCERTAINED TO BE PRESENT IN THE SYNOVIA WHICH ABE THOUGH INL A VERY SMALL QUANTITY IN THE NATURAL STATE OF THAT FLUID EXPLAINS THE MODE BYWHICH THE CRUST OF ENAMEL ON THE HEAD OF THE THIGH BONE COULD BE PRODUCED WHEN BY A MORBID ACTION OF THE PARTS THE QUANTITY OF PHOSPHATE WAS PRETERNATURALLY INCREASED A MIXTURE OF BONY MATTER WITH THE ENAMEL AND THE SUB STANCE OF THE TOOTH IS A STRUCTURE AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED NOT CONFINED TO THE ELEPHANT IT IS COMMON TO ALL TRULY GRAMINI VOROUS QUADRUPEDS BUT THE WHOLE NUMBER OF GRINDING TEETH BELONGING TO EACH SIDE OF THE JAW BEING CONFINED INA CASE OF BONE SO AS TO FORM ONE LARGE GRINDING SURFACE AND THE TEETH BEING PUSHED FORWARD FROM BEHIND INSTEAD OF A SECOND SET KK2248 MR HOMES OBSERVATIONS ON THE STRUCTURE OF BEING FORMED IMMEDIATELY UNDER THE FANGS OF THE FIRST AS IN OTHER ANIMALS ARE PECULIARITIES NOT MET WITH IN ANY TEETH HITHERTO DESCRIBED EXCEPT  THOSE OF THE ELEPHANT THESE PECULIARITIES HAVE HOWEVER BEEN ASCERTAINED IN THE COURSE OF THE PRESENT INQUIRY TO BELONG TO THE SUS LTHIOPICUS A SKULL OF WHICH WITH THE TEETH IS PREERVED IN MR HUNTERS COLLECTION THE PARTICULAR SPECIES TO WHICH IT BELONGED WAS DETERMINED BY ITS EXACT SIMILARITY TO A SKULL WITHOUT THE GRIND ING TEETH IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM MARKED IN DR SOLANDERS HANDWRITING SITS ETHIOPICUS FROM GUINEA AS THE GRINDINGTEETH OF THIS ANIMAL HAVE NOT BEEN BEFORE NOTICED FIGURES OF THE HEAD AND TEETH ARE ANNEXED TAB XVIII AND XIX AND AS IT HAS BEEN ASCERTAINED BY DR SOLAN DER TO COME FROM GUINEA THERE IS REASON TO HOPE SO CURIOUS A SPECIES OF THE HOG WILL ATTRACT THENOTICEOF NATURALISTS AND BE THE MEANS OF PERFECT SPECIMENS BEING INTRODUCED INTO THIS COUNTRY FROM THE APPEARANCE OF THE TEETH IN THE PERFECTSKULL THE ANIMAL HAD PROBABLY ARRIVED AT ITS FULL GROWTH AND ONLY ONE GRINDER REMAINED ON EACH SIDE OF THE JAW CONSISTING OF SEVEN DIFFERENT PROCESSES CASED WITH BONE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE ELE PHANT THE GRINDING SURFACE OF THOSE PROCESSES WHICH HAD THEIR POINTS WORN DOWN SUFFICIENTLY TO SHOW A TRANSVERSE SECTION EX POSED THREE OVAL PORTIONS OF TOOTH SURROUNDED BY ENAMEL IN CLOSED IN BONE WHICH IS MORE LIKE THE TOOTH OF THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT THAN THE ASIATIC AND MAKES ANOTHER VARIETY OF FORM OF THESE PROCESSES THE TUSKS OF THE SUIS LTHIOPICUS ARE UNCOMMONLY LARGE AND IN THEIR STRUCTURE RESEMBLE THOSE OF THE ELEPHANT THE SKULL WAS SHOWN TO SIR JOSEPH BANES WHOSE READINESS TO FORWARD THE LABOURS OF THOSE WHO ENGAGE IN THEPURSUITS OFTHE TEETH OF GRAMINIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS 249 SCIENCE BY LIBERALLY COMMUNICATING TO THEM HIS OWN KNOWLEDGE OF THE SUBJECTS CONNECTED WITH THEIR INQUIRIES IS SUFFICIENTLY KNOWN TO THE MEMBERS OF THIS LEARNED SOCIETY HE IDENTIFIED THE SPECIES OF THE GENUS TO WHICH THE SKULL BELONGED IN THE MANNER ABOVE MENTIONED AND BY AN ACCURATE SEARCH AMONG THE SKULLS OF ANI MALS DEPOSITED IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM DISCOVERED A SMALL HEAD IN A DRIED STATE WHICH WHEN PROPERLY MACERATED AND CLEANED PROVEA TO BE THAT OF A YOUNG SUS ZETHIOPICUS WHOSE TEETH WERE IT A GROWING STATE AND ENABLE ME TO EXPLAIN ALL THE NECESSARY CIRCUMSTANCES RESPECTING THIS CURIOUS MODE OF DENTITION THE GRINDING TEETH IN THIS YOUNG HEAD ARE DISTINCT FROM EACH OTHER AND FOUR IN NUMBER ON EACH SIDE OF THE JAW THAT WHICH IS MOST ANTERIOR IS THE SMALLEST AND HAS A GRIND ING SURFACE ONLY EQUAL IN EXTENT TO THAT OF ONE OF THE PROCESSES CONTAINED IN THE LARGE TOOTH OF THE FULL GROWN ANIMAL THE SE COND HAS A GRINDING SURFACE EQUAL TO THAT OF TWO SUCH PRO CESSES THE THIRD IS STILL LARGER ITS SURFACE BEING EQUAL TO THAT OF THREE PROCESSES THESE THREE TEETH IN THEIR GENERAL APPEARANCES RESEMBLE THOSE OF THE COMMON HOG THEY HAVE ALSO THE SAME KIND OF FANGS THEIR ONLY PECULIARITY IS THE ENAMEL BEING INTERMIXED WITH THE SUBSTANCE OF THE TOOTH BUT WITHOUT ANY BONY MATTER SURROUNDING IT THE FOURTH OR LAST TOOTH IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS AND EXACTLY RESEMBLES THAT FOUND IN THE LARGE HEAD ONLY THAT THIS IS IN A GROWING STATE IT IS COMPOSED OF SEVEN PROCESSES UNITED TOGETHER THESE ARE IN DIFFERENT STAGES OF GROWTH FITTING THEN TO COME FORWARD IN SUCCESSIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE ELEPHANT THE TWO FIRST HAVE THEIR GRINDING SURFACE WORN SMOOTH THE POINTS OF THE TWO NEXT HAVE RECENTLY CUT THE GUM  AND THEMR HOMES OBSERVATIONS ON TIE STRUCTURE OF OTHER THREE ARE STILL CONCEALED IN THE JAW NOT BEING COMPLETELY FORMED OF THE LAST OF THESE THE FIRST RUDIMENTS ONLY ARE TO BE SEEN THIS LARGE TOOTH WHICH MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A SECOND SET OF TEETH AS THE CONCEALED PROCESSES ENLARGE ADVANCES FORE WARDS PUSHING THE OTHER TEETH BEFORE IT THE MOST ANTERIOR OF THESE AS SOON AS ITS BODY IS WORN AWAY HAS ITS FANGS REMOVED BY ABSORPTION AND DROPS OUT THE SAME THING TAKES PLACE WITH THE SECOND AND THIRD AND IN THIS WAY ROOM IS MADE FOR THE LARGE ONE TO SUPPLY THE PLACE OF ALL THE OTHERS THE MODE IN WHICH THEY SUCCEED ONE ANOTHER IS ILLUSTRATED BY THE ANNEXED DRAWING OF A SIDE VIEW OF THE JAW TAB XIX IN WHICH THE FANGS OF THE DIFFERENT TEETH ARE EXPOSED AND THE BODY OF THE THIRD TOOTH HAVING BEEN MOVED FORWARD AS THE LAST INCREASED IN SIZE IS DISTINCTLY SEEN THESE PECULIARITIES IN THE TEETH OF THE SUS ITBIOPICUS LED TO THE EXAMINATION OF THE TEETH OF THE OTHER SPECIES OF THE SAME GENUS ALL OF WHICH APPEAR TO RESEMBLE THE HUMAN GRINDERS ONLY THAT THE LAST IN THE JAW HAS A BROADER GRINDING SURFACE THAN THE REST WHICH IS COMMON TO MOST QUADRUPEDS IT IS WORTHY OF REMARK THAT THE NUMBER IN EACH SIDE OF THE JAW IN THE COMMON HOG IS SEVEN IN THE PECARY SIX IN THE BABY ROUSSA FIVE AND IN THE SUS ETHIOPICUS TILL A CERTAIN AGE FOUR IT IS CURIOUS THAT ONE SPECIES OF A GENUS SHOULD DIFFER SO WIDELY FROM ALL THE OTHERS IN RESPECT TO ITS TEETH AND SHOULD BE ALLIED TO THE ELEPHANT IN THE STRUCTURE OF ITS TUSKS THE MODE OF FORMATION OF THE GRINDING TEETH AND THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY SUCCEED ONE ANOTHER FROM THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IT APPEARS THAT THE SUS LETBHIOPICUS IN A NATURAL STATE IS SUPPLIED WITH ATHE TEETH OF GRAMITNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS DIFFERENT KIND OF FOOD FROM THAT OF OTHER HOGS AND IS AN ANIMAL OF GREATER LONGEVITY UPON COMPARING THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE ELEPHANTS TOOTH WITH THAT OF THE HORSE COW AND SHEEP IT WAS FOUND THAT THEY WERE SIMILAR IN HAVING AN INTERMIXTURE OF BONE WITH THE SUBSTANCE OF THE TOOTH BUT THAT THEY DIFFERED MATERIALLY FROM ONE ANOTHER IN THE PROPORTIONS AND SITUATIONS OF THE BONY PORTIONS EACH OF THESE ANIMALS HAVING THE GRINDING SURFACE OF THEIR TEETH ADAPTED FOR PARTICULAR KINDS OF FOOD THE PARTS COME POSING THAT SURFACE ARE VARIOUSLY COMBINED SO AS TO ANSWER THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH THE TEETH ARE INTENDED IN ALLOF THEM THE MODE OF GROWTH IS THE SAME THE SUBSTANCE OF THE TOOTH IS FIRST FORMED AND THE BONY PART IS AFTERWARDS ADAPTED TO THE IRREGULARITIES OF THAT SURFACE IN THE HORSES GRINDING TEETH THE PROCESSES ARE TWO IINI NUMB BER AND IN AN EARLY STAGE OF THEIR GROWTH THEY APPEAR AS WELL AS THOSE OF THE ELEPHANT TO BE SEPARATE TEETH THEY DIFFER HOWEVER EXTREMELY IN THEIR SHAPE FORMING IRREGULAR CYLINDRICAL TUBES THE CENTRAL PART OF WHICH IS FILLED UP BY THE PROJECTING MEMBRANES FROM THE GUMS THAT ARE TO BE CHANGED FOR BONE THIS DIVISION OF THE TOOTH INTO TWO PARTS IS VERY DISTINCT IN THE SHEDDING TEETH BUT NOT IN THE SECOND SET OR PERMANENT TEETHF THESE TWO PORTIONS OF BONE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TOOTH HAVE FREQUENTLY A THOLE IN THEM PROBABLY THE PASSAGE OF A BLOOD VESSEL NEVER COMPLETELY FILLED UP AND THE FOOD GETTING INTO IT AS THE TOOTH IS WORN DOWN CONSIDERABLY INCREASES ITS SIZE BESIDES WHICH THERE IS A PORTION OF BONY SUBSTANCE SURROUNDING A GREAT PART OF THE OUTSIDE OF THE TOOTH IN THE COWS GRINDING TEETH THERE ARE TWO PORTIONS OF BONYOX52 MR HOMES OBSERVATIONS ON TBE STRUCTURE OF SUBSTANCE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TOOTH AS IN THE HORSE IN SHAPE OF CRESCENTS AND A VERY SMALL PORTION IN THE HOLLOWS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE TOOTH BUT NONE ON THE PRO JECTING PARTS IN THE GRINDING TEETH OF THE SHEEP THE MIDDLE PORTIONS OF BONE ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE COW BUT ON A MUCH SMALLER SCALE THERE IS NO PORTION OF BONE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE TOOTH IT IS NOT TO BE WONDERED AT THAT THERE IS SO GREAT A VARIETY IN THE GRINDING SURFACES OF THE TEETH OF DIFFERENT GENERA OF GRAMI NIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS EACH NO DOUBT ADAPTED TO THE KIND OF FOOD THEY ARE IN A STATE OF NATURE DESTINED TO LIVE UPON SINCE THERE IS EVEN A VARIATION BETWEEN THE TEETH OF THE AFRICAN AND ASIATIC ELEPHANTS IN THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT THE PROCESSES OF WHICH THE TOOTH IS COMPOSED ARE NOT FLATTENED OVALS AS THEY HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED IN THE ASIATIC BUT ARE IN THE FORM OF AN OBLONG SQUARE OR PARALLELOPIPEDON SO THAT IN THE MIDDLE LINE OF THE TOOTH THE PROCESSES ARE IN CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER ALTHOUGH AT NO OTHER PART BY THIS MEANS THE MIDDLE LINE OF THE TOOTH IS THE HARDEST THE WHOLE SURFACE THEREFORE DOES NOT WEAR REGULARLY AS IN THE ASIATIC ELEPHANT BUT WITH A RIDGE IN THE MIDDLE AS A DESCRIPTION OF THE GRINDING SURFACE OF THE TEETH OF THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT THE HORSE COW AND SHEEP WOULD BE VERY TEDIOUS TO MAKE IT AT ALL INTELLIGIBLE AND AS THE SURFACES OF THE TEETH CAN BE VERY DISTINCTLY REPRESENTED IN A DRAWING I HAVE PREFERRED THAT MODE OF SHOWING THEIR COMPARATIVE STRUCTURE SEE TAB XVI AND XX HAVING BY THE FOREGOING OBSERVATIONS ESTABLISHED A WELL MARKED CHARACTERISTIC DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE TEETH OF TRULY CARNIVOROUS AND TRULY GRAMINIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS I WAS DESIROUSTHE TEETH OF GRAMINIVOROUS QUCADRUPEDS 25 OF KNOWING HOW FAR THIS GENERAL RULE APPLIED TO QUADRUPEDS AT LARGE AND IF IT DID NOT IN WHAT ANIMALS THE TEETH WERE DIFFE RENTLY FORMED THE TEETH OF THE HIPPOPOTAMUS AND RHINOCEROS ARE FOUND TO DIFFER IN THEIR STRUCTURE FROM THOSE ABOVE DESCRIBED PARTAKING IL SOME MEASURE OF THE PROPERTIES OF BOTH AND FORMING TWO VERY CURIOUS LINKS IN THE CHAIN OF REGULAR GRADATION BETWEEN THE ONE AND THE OTHER THE GRINDING TEETH OF THE HIPPOPOTAMUS ARE MADE UP OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE TOOTH AND ENAMEL ONLY HAVING NO PORTION OF BONE MIXED WITH THE OTHER PARTS BUT WHAT IS I BELIEVE PECULIAR TO THEM THE ENAMREL PERVADES THE SUBSTANCE OF THE TOOTH TO A CONLSIDERABLE DEPTH SO AS TO BE INTERMIXED WITH IT THIS WILL BE BETTER UNDERSTOOD BY REFERRING TO THE FIGURES TFAB XX WHICH REPRESENT THE APPEARANCE OF THE ENAMEL IN DIFFERENT SEC TIONS OF THE TOOTH THE GRINDING TEETH OF THE RHINOCEROS HAVE A PECULIARITY OF A VERY DIFFERENT KIND THEY ALSO ARE ONLY COMPOSED OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE TOOTH AND ENAMEL BUT THE TOOTH IS SO FORMED AS NEARLY TO SURROUND A MIDDLE SPACE WHICH WERE IT FILLED UP WITH BONE WOULD MAKE A TRULY GRAMINIVOROUS TOOTH NOT UNLIKE THOSE ABOVE DESCRIBED THIS MIDDLE SPACE IS LEFT OPEN AND BECOMES FILLED VUP WITH THE MASTICATED FOOD WHICH FALLS INTO IT AND CANNOT AF TERWARDS BE READILY REMOVED SO THAT THE GRINDING SURFACE WILL BE ALWAYS KEPT IRREGULAR AND IN A STILL GREATER DEGREE THAN IN ANY OF THE OTHER TEETH WHICH HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED THE PARTI CULAR FORM OF THIS TOOTH IS REPRESENTED IN TAB XXI IT IS HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT THERE ARE MANY OTHER VARIETIES IN XTHE STRUCTURE OF THE GRINDING TEETH OF QUADRUPEDS BUT THESE WILL MDCCXCIX L I25 4 MR HOMES OBSERVATIONS ON THE STRUCTURE OF BE SUFFICIENT TO ILLUSTRATE THE GENERAL

STEEPED IN THE MURIATIC ACID TO RENDER IT SOFT THAT IT MIGHT BE DIVIDED WITH LESS INJURY TO THE TENDER PARTS THE DIFFERENT PROCESSES WHICH COMPOSE THE TOOTH ARE DIS TINCTLY SEEN BUT THE ENAMEL WHICH SURROUNDED THEM WAS DIS SOLVED IN THE ACID SO THAT THERE IS A VACANT SPACE BETWEEN THEM AND THE BONY SUBSTANCE IN WHICH THEY APPEAR TO BE IMBEDDED THE BONY SUBSTANCE WHICH IS COMPLETELY FORMED ALONG

one of two claimants to an office brought mandamus for his salary Held mandamus would lie even though the title to the office was involved in the issue McKainnay v Horton Cal 1907 i9 Pac 598 Mandimus is the proper remedy for one holding clear title to office to enforce purely ministerial acts Lawrence v Hanley I89g 84 Mich 399 State ex rel Leeds v Atlantic City I889 52 N J L 332 but it is well settled that a disputed title to office may not be directly determined by mandamus since the proper procedure is by quo warranto Kiing v Mayor 1788 2 T R 259 People ex rel Cuthbert v Detroit I809 I8

contestants for the office of mayor but says that it may inquire into it for the determination of the mandamus proceedings But since the relators right to any salary can be established only by determining the title of his appointor it would not seem proper to grant the writ when the courts decision as to it has no legal effect Cf S3mith v Hodgson Ga 1907 59 S E 272 AGENCYTENDER BY

Brown v Dysinger Pa 1829 I Rawle 408 And in the absence of previous authority a ratification by the debtor is easily made out Tacey v Irvin 1873 I8 Wall 549 even by setting up the tender as a defense

witness swears falsely he commits an offense against the public and is punishable for perjury As an action of dis barment involves the protection of the public it seems that the principal case extends

its charter using the name of the Emperor of Austria as part of its corporate name thereby inducing ignorant Austrian immigrants to deal with it under the belief that in this country as in Austria the use of the Emperors name showed that the business was under his special patronage Held that at the suit of the consul under the treaty between the United States and the Em peror of Austria ratified June 27th I871 an injunction would issue against the use of the Emperors name Von Theodorovich v Franz Josef Beneficial Assn 1907 I54 Fed 91I The treaty provides that consuls may in the exercise of

upon the fact of a debt due to the plaintiffs debtor and also upon the theory of property The Georgia Code I895  4712 provides that all debts owing to the defendant or any prop erty in the hands of a third party at the time of process or before answer are subject to garnishment Although a claim arising from tort may be considered as property of the injured party Banks v McCandless 1I9 Ga 793 798 the garnishment of the tortfeasor cannot hold it since the property is not in his hands Code  47I2 supra But the code pro vision is broad enough to include under debts everything becoming due by the

Goddard I835 16 Pick 504 Carthage v Frederick supra But to impose on the abutter the duty of allaying the dust on the street would be pushing the police power to the verge of uncon stitutionality and

JURISDICTIONA bill to foreclose a mortgage on real property was filed by a British subject against citizens of California The N C Investment Trust Ltd also a British subject intervened and filed a crossbill for the foreclosure of a junior mortgage against the above defendants and made one Powell a British subject also a defendant to the crossbill The original defendants de murred to the crossbill Held the demurrer would be sustained Newton v Gage 1907 I55 Fed 598 Where a crossbill brings in new parties who as original parties would have defeated the jurisdiction of the Federal courts on the ground of the nondiversity of citizenship the jurisdiction is thereby ousted Shields v Barrow 1854 17 How U S 130 I45 The court in the principal case notes two exceptions where the new party claims an interest in property or a fund of which the court holds possession Krippendorf v Hyde 1884 IIo U S 276 and where such party represents an interest already before the Court Society of Shakers v Watson 1895 68 Fed 730 736 The meaning of the latter phrase is not clear It may describe the case of an executor who comes in to represent his testator who has died pending the suit or it may refer to an interest of the intervenor which is neces sarily involved in the principal litigation although still separable from that of the original parties so as to permit a decree Society of Shakers v Watson supra or it may mean that the new party possesses an interest which is identical with an interest of one of the principal parties Phelps v Oaks 1886 II7 U S 236 The last is the broadest construction and if applied literally the exception might be used as a device to let in parties barred by the diverse citizenship requirement A qualification is necessary and may be thus stated the intervening party must not be one who was an indispensable party to the original bill Intervention is a different proceeding from that of making parties to the main controversy Gregory v Pike I895 67

enforce a lien upon specific personal property within the state Code  438 sub 5 Held the order was valid Morgan v Mutual B L Ins Co N Y I907 82 N E 438 Assuming that a debt is specific personal property within the meaning of the Code the decision in the principal case involves the remaining point of the situs of the debt The rule that the state which charters a cor poration is its domicil

Osborn v Governors of Guys Hospital 1726 2 Str 728 Dye v Kerr N Y I85I 15 Barb 444 The fact that the intestate had lost capacity to contract because of the accident and therefore could not have made a binding contract for the plaintiffs services does not affect the right to recover since the obligations enforced under the doctrine of quasicontract are those imposed by law irrespective of intention or power to enter into contract Sceva v True 1873 53 N H 627 Sawyer v Lufkin x868 58 Me 308 Trainer v Turnbull I886 14I Mass 527 Earle v Reed Mass 1845 o1 Met 387 REAL PROPERTYDEEDSO0IISSION OF GRANTORS NAMxEA life tenant and two remaindermen of a parcel of land signed and sealed a deed purporting to convey an estate in fee but in which only the life tenant was mentioned as grantor Held the deed conveyed the interests of the remaindermen Sterling v Park Ga I907 58 S E 828 A deed must contain words sufficient to set forth the agreement of the parties Shep T 55 Accordingly the grantor must be described by name as a party to the deed Co Litt35 b Sealing and delivering is not sufficient to make one a party East Skidmore v Vaudstevan I586 Cro Eliz 56 It has been held that where a partys

Ellesdon I69o 2 Vent 141 Lord Say and Seals Case I7Ir o0 Mod 40 But in the principal case there appeared no mention of the remaindermen or of their intention to convey It isdifficult to see therefore how their interests could be held to have passed without a disregard for the essentials of a valid deed This view is supported by the great weight of authority in this country Catlin v Ware I812 9

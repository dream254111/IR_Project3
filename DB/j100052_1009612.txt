J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1009612,REPRESENTATION IN NEW ENGLAND LEGISLATURES,I242502,REPRESENTATION IN NEW ENGLAND LEGIS LATURES THREE CLAUSES IN THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION RAISE TO THE DIG NITY OF NATIONAL INTEREST AND IMPORTANCE ANYTHING AFFECTING REPRESENTATION IN THE STATE LEGISLATURES IT IS ONLY PERSONS DULY QUALIFIED FOR ELECTORS OF THE MORE NUMEROUS BRANCH OF THE LEGISLATURE IN EACH STATE WHO ARE BY VIRTUE OF THAT FACT EN TITLED TO VOTE IN FEDERAL ELECTIONS IT IS THE STATE LEGISLATURES THAT ELECT FEDERAL SENATORS AND AGAIN IT IS THESE SAME ASSEMBLIES THAT DETERMINE THE METHOD BY WHICH PRESIDENTIAL ELECTORS SHALL BE CHOSEN A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY OF REPRE SENTATION IN ALL THE STATE LEGISLATURES WOULD THROW LIGHT ON IMPORTANT LINES OF OUR INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT DIFFER ENCES OF POLITICAL TEMPER AND HABIT WOULD FORCE THEMSELVES INTO VIEW THE ANOMALOUS VARIETY IN THE SUFFRAGE BY WHICH CONGRESS IS ELECTED THE STRIKING DIFFERENCES AMONG THE BODIES BY WHICH FEDERAL SENATORS ARE CHOSEN WOULD STAND REVEALED A STUDY OF SO SMALL AND SO HOMOGENEOUS A GROUP OF STATES AS NEW ENGLAND MUST SACRIFICE MUCH OF THIS NATIONAL INTEREST WHICH WOULD ATTACH TO AN INVESTIGATION OF THE BROADER FIELD IT MAY HOWEVER RETAIN A CLEARNESS OF DEFINITION TOGETHER WITH A MINUTENESS WHICH WOULD BE QUITE IMPOSSIBLE WERE IT ATTEMPTED TO BRING THE FORTYFOUR STATE LEGISLATURES AT ONCE BENEATH THE GLASS I WHO ARE REPRESENTED OR RATHER WHO MAY VOTE FOR MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURES IT IS A CONSERVATIVE ANSWER WHICH NEW ENGLAND GIVES TO THIS QUESTION IN ALL SIX OF THE STATES THERE IS UNANIMITY IN CONFINING THE SUFFRAGE FOR STATE REPRESENTATIVES AND HENCE FOR CONGRESSMEN TO MALES AT LEAST TWENTYONE YEARS OF AGE WHO ARE CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES BY BIRTH OR BY NAT URALIZATION THERE ARE EXCLUDED CRIMINALS PERSONS UNDER 254TEW ENGLAND LEGISLATIVE REPRESENTATION 59 GUARDIANSHIP AND PAUPERS NEEDY SOLDIERS AND SAILORS OF THE LATE WAR HOWEVER ARE NOT DISFRANCHISED AND NEW HAMP SHIRE WITHHOLDS THE BALLOT FROM NO MAN AS A PAUPER UNLESS HE HAS RECEIVED PUBLIC RELIEF WITHIN THE NINETY DAYS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE ELECTION EVEN HE MAY VOTE IF BEFORE APPEARING AT THE POLLS HE TENDERS TO THE PROPER OFFICER A RETURN OF THE AID RECEIVED FORMAL PROPERTY QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE LEGISLATIVE SUFFRAGE NO LONGER EXIST IN ANY OF THE NEW ENGLAND STATES RHODE ISLAND SWEPT AWAY THE LAST OF THESE ONLY SEVEN YEARS AGO THE PAYMENT OF A POLLTAX AS A PREREQUISITE FOR VOTING HAS ALSO FALLEN INTO DISFAVOR IN MASSACHUSETTS IT HAS BEEN ABOLISHED IN NEW HAMPSHIRE PERSONS EXCUSED AT THEIR OWN REQUEST FROM THE PAYMENT OF THEIR TAX MAY NOT VOTE UNLESS THEY FIRST MAKE A TENDER OF THE AMOUNT OF THE TAXA PROVISION WHICH CERTAINLY DOES NOT DISCOURAGE CORRUPTION AT THE POLLS AS TO RESIDENCE QUALIFICATIONS MAINE IS MOST LENIENT INSIST ING ONLY ON A THREE MONTHS PREVIOUS RESIDENCE IN THE TOWN WHERE THE MAN WISHES TO VOTE NEW HAMPSHIRE DOUBLES THIS TERM IN ADDITION TO THIS SIX MONTHS OF LOCAL RESIDENCE ALL THE OTHER STATES INSIST ON A LONGER TERM OF PROBATION WITHIN THE COMMONWEALTH RHODE ISLAND IS THE MOST EXACT ING IN THIS RESPECT NO MAN IS QUALIFIED TO VOTE FOR REPRESEN TATIVE UNTIL HE HAS BREATHED THE AIR OF NARRAGANSETT BAY FOR AT LEAST TWO YEARS OF THE FOUR STATES IN THE UNION WHICH HAVE ADOPTED AN EDUCATIONAL QUALIFICATION FOR THE SUFFRAGE THREE ARE IN NEW ENGLAND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CENTURY MASSACHUSETTS AND CONNECTICUT SET A WORTHY EXAMPLE BY REQUIRING THE CANDIDATE FOR REGISTRATION TO PROVE HIS ABILITY TO READ THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND TO WRITE HIS OWN NAME TWO YEARS AGO MAINE ADOPTED A SIMILAR QUALIFICATION RECENT LEGISLATION HAS AIMED TO MAKE THIS TEST MORE EFFECTIVE AND TO PREVENT THE POSSIBILITY OF COLLUSION BUT NONE OF THESE STATES HAS YET ADDED THE MISSISSIPPI REFINEMENT OF REQUIRING THE WOULDBE 25560 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY VOTER TO INTERPRET THE CONSTITUTION TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE REGISTRAR II WHO ARE THE LEGISLATORS TURNING FROM THE ELECTORS TO THE BODIES WHICH REPRESENT THEM WE FIND SIX BICAMERAL LEGISLATURES DIFFERING WIDELY IN RELATIVE NUMBERS IN QUALIFICATIONS IN PERSONNEL AND IN THE BASIS OF REPRESENTATION ON WHICH THEY ARE CHOSEN IN ALL BUT MASSACHUSETTS AND RHODE ISLAND THE SESSIONS ARE BIENNIAL AND IN BOTH OF THESE CONSERVATIVE STATES CONSTITUTIONAL AMEND MENTS ARE NOW PENDING ABOLISHING THE ANNUAL SESSION IN FAVOR OF THE BIENNIAL THE TABLE ON THE NEXT PAGE PRESENTS SOME OF THE POINTS OF DIFFERENCE AMONG THE LEGISLATURES LARGE AS IS THE IMMIGRANT POPULATION IN SOME OF THE NEW ENGLAND STATES VERY FEW OF ALIEN BIRTH HAVE FOUND THEIR WAY INTO THE LEGISLATURES IN ALMOST EVERY CASE AT LEAST THREE FOURTHS OF THE MEMBERS ARE NATIVES OF THE STATES WHERE THEY NOW RESIDE IN MAINE THIRTYFIVE PER CENT OF THE MEMBERS IN EACH HOUSE WERE BORN IN THE TOWNS WHICH THEY NOW REP RESENT AGRICULTURE CLAIMS MORE OF THE MEMBERS THAN ANY OTHER CALLING A FACT WHICH TOGETHER WITH A TENDER SOLICITUDE FOR THE FARMERS VOTE EXPLAINS MUCH RECENT LEGISLATION IN NEW HAMPSHIRE IT IS REPORTED THAT ALL MATTERS PERTAINING TO AGRI CULTURE BEFORE BEING VOTED UPON IN THE LEGISLATURE RECEIVED A PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATION IN A FARMERS COUNCIL MADE UP OF THE HUNDRED FARMERS IN BOTH BRANCHES OF THE LEGISLATURE THE LARGE PROPORTION OF FARMERS IN THE CONNECTICUT ASSEM BLY IS EXPLAINED BY THE PECULIAR BASIS OF REPRESENTATION TO WHICH THAT STATE STILL CLINGS IN MASSACHUSETTS AND RHODE ISLAND THE MERCANTILE AND MANUFACTURING INTERESTS HAVE A CONSIDERABLE REPRESENTATION THE MASSACHUSETTS

ACADEMY MATION ARE UNOFFICIAL AND ARE BOTH INCOMPLETE AND INACCURATE THERE IS SOME UNANIMITY AS TO WHAT CONSTITUTES A COLLEGIATE EDUCATION BUT  ACADEMIC  IS ALTOGETHER TOO ELASTIC A TERM IT IS A VALUELESS DISTINCTION TO DIGNIFY THE EDUCATION RECEIVED AT AN ENDOWED SCHOOL AS ACADEMIC IN CONTRAST WITH A  PUBLIC SCHOOL EDUCATION OBTAINED IN A HIGH SCHOOL OF THE SAME GRADE IN ALL OF THE STATES IT IS CONSIDERED AN ESSENTIAL QUALIFICA TION THAT THE MEMBER BE AN ACTUAL RESIDENT OF THE TOWN OR DISTRICT WHICH HE REPRESENTS NONE BUT THE MEMBER FROM POMPEY  CAN KNOW THE NEEDS OF POMPEY WELL ENOUGH TO PARTICIPATE INTELLIGENTLY IN STATE LEGISLATION IN THIS RESPECT MASSACHUSETTS AT LEAST HAS ABANDONED COLONIAL PRECEDENTS IN THE EARLY DAYS MEN OF BOSTON AND SALEM OFTEN USED TO STAND FOR MORE REMOTE CONSTITUENCIES BUT TODAY THE REQUIREMENT OF LOCAL RESIDENCE HAS FOUND ITS WAY INTO MOST OF THE CONSTI TUTIONS THUS THE NEW HAMPSHIRE REPRESENTATIVE WHO CEASES TO BE  AN INHABITANT OF THE TOWN PARISH OR PLACE HE MAY BE CHOSEN TO REPRESENT FROM THAT MOMENT CEASES IPSO FACTO TO BE A MEMBER OF THE LAWMAKING BODY EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF STATUTORY REQUIREMENT CUSTOM INSISTS RIGIDLY ON THE LEGISLATORS RESIDENCE WITHIN HIS CONSTITUENCY RHODE ISLAND HOWEVER PROHIBITS THE DIVISION OF ANY TOWN OR CITY INTO DISTRICTS FOR THE CHOICE OF REPRESENTATIVES III WHAT IS THE BASIS OF REPRESENTATION   VOX POPILI MAY BE VOX DEI SAYS SIR HENRY MAINE BUT VERY LITTLE ATTENTION SHOWS THAT THERE NEVER HAS BEEN ANY AGREEMENT AS TO WHAT VOX MEANS OR AS TO WHAT POPULUS MEANS IS THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE THE VOICE WHICH SPEAKS THROUGH SCRUTIN DARRONDISSEMENT OR THROUGH SCRZUIN DE LISLE BY PLEBISCILE OR BY TUMULTUARY ASSEMBLY  IN NEW ENGLAND HOW WAS VOX POPULI TO TRANSLATE ITSELF INTO VOX DEI  ON ONE POINT OUR FOREFATHERS WERE AGREED IT MUST BE THROUGH REPRESENTATION WAS NOT THAT THE VERY THING FOR WHICH THEY HAD BEEN FIGHTING  MOREOVER THAT REPRESENTATION OUGHT SO FAR AS POSSIBLE TO BE EQUAL SO SAID 258NEW ENGLAND LEGISLATIVE REPRESENTATION 63 THE CONSTITUTIONS BUT IN WHAT DOES THIS EQUALITY CONSIST DOES IT REQUIRE THAT THE VOICE OF THE MINORITY SHOULD BE HEARD  THIS WAS ANSWERED UNHESITATINGLY IN THE NEGATIVE DOES EQUALITY MEAN THE SAME NUMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM EACH DISTRICT EACH TOWN  OR REGARDLESS OF THE BOUNDARIES OF POLITICAL UNITS DOES IT MEAN ONE REPRESENTATIVE FOR A CER TAIN QUOTA OF INHABITANTS  OR FOR A CERTAIN QUOTA OF VOTERS  ON THESE QUESTIONS OPINION WAS DIVIDED AND HAS SO REMAINED HERE ARE TWELVE LEGISLATIVE BODIES A IN FIVE OF THE SENATES REPRESENTATION IS BY COUNTIES OR BY DISTRICTS REGARDFUL OF COUNTY LINES IN ALL OF THESE SOME ATTEMPT IS MADE TO PRO PORTION REPRESENTATION TO POPULATION OR TO VOTING STRENGTH RHODE ISLAND IS THE ONLY ONE OF THE SIX STATES THAT BASES SENATORIAL REPRESENTATION ON THE TOWN WITHOUT REGARD TO POPULATION B IN TWO OF THE HOUSES IT IS THE TOWNS AS POLIT CAL UNITS THAT ARE REPRESENTED EACH HAVING THE SAME NUMBER C IN THREE TOWNS ARE REPRESENTED BUT WITH MORE OR LESS ELABORATE AND WORKABLE DEVICES FOR SECURING A DEGREE OF PROPORTIONALITY TO POPULATION D IN ONE REPRESENTATION IS IN PROPORTION TO THE NUMBER OF LEGAL VOTERS TOWNS AS SUCH HAVING NO MINIMUM REPRESENTATION IT WAS THE ORGANIZATION OF A NEW ENGLAND LEGISLATURE THAT IN 787 SUGGESTED THE COMPROMISE WHEREBY THE INTERESTS OF THE LARGE AND SMALL STATES WERE HARMONIZED BY THE CONSTITU TIONAL PROVISION FOR A BICAMERAL CONGRESS EACH HOUSE RESTING ON A DIFFERENT BASIS IN THE NEW ENGLAND ASSEMBLIES TODAY IT IS THE RULE THAT ONE CHAMBERNOW THE HOUSE NOW THE SENATEREPRESENTS POLITICAL UNITS WHILE THE OTHER REPRESENTS POPULATION THE ONLY EXCEPTION IS IN MASSACHUSETTS WHERE FOR BOTH CHAMBERS THE SAME BASIS OF REPRESENTATION HAS BEEN CHOSEN AND CARRIED OUT WITH THE LEAST PRACTICABLE INTERFER ENCE FROM TOWN BOUNDARY LINES IN BOTH HOUSE AND SENATE IT IS NOT TOWNS OR COUNTIES NOT INHABITANTS  OR POPULATION BUT LEGAL VOTERS THAT ARE REPRESENTED AFTER EACH STATE CENSUS THE COMMONWEALTH IS DIVIDED INTO REPRESENTATIVE AND SENATORIAL DISTRICTS EACH OF WHICH SHALL CONTAIN AS 25964 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY NEARLY AS POSSIBLE THE PROPER QUOTA OF LEGAL VOTERS TOWNS OR WARDS OF CITIES MAY NOT BE DIVIDED BUT MAY BE COMBINED IN MAKING UP A DISTRICT THE REPRESENTATION WHICH A COUNTY RECEIVES DEPENDS ENTIRELY UPON ITS VOTING STRENGTH THERE IS NO MAXIMUM OR MINIMUM FIXED BY LAW THUS SUFFOLK COUNTY SENDS NINE SENATORS WHILE BARNSTABLE DUKES AND NANTUCKET COUNTIES CONSTITUTE THE  CAPE DISTRICT AND SEND BUT ONE SENATOR TO BOSTON MAINE NEW HAMPSHIRE AND VERMONT AS WELL AS MASSA CHUSETTS PROVIDE FOR PERIODIC REAPPORTIONMENTS OF THE SENA TORS AMONG COUNTIES OR DISTRICTS CONFORMING TO COUNTY LINES IN PROPORTION TO POPULATION VERMONT INSISTS THAT EACH COUNTY MUST HAVE AT LEAST ONE SENATOR THE NEW HAMP SHIRE CONSTITUTION WHILE DECLARING THAT THE SENATORIAL DISTRICTS SHALL BE AS NEARLY EQUAL AS POSSIBLE DIRECTS THE APPORTIONERS TO  GOVERN THEMSELVES IN THE PROPORTION OF THE DIRECT TAXES PAID BY THE SAID DISTRICTS CONNECTICUT ADMITS THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY TO POPULATION BUT WITH SO LARGE A MINIMUM GUARANTEED TO EACH COUNTY AS TO MAKE IT PRACTICALLY INOPERATIVE SINCE EACH OF THE EIGHT MUST HAVE AT LEAST TWO SENATORS OUT OF THE TWENTYFOUR IT RESULTS THAT TOLLAND COUNTY MADE UP OF SPARSELY SETTLED FARMING TOWN SHIPS WITH A TOTAL POPULATION OF 25O8I HAS 83 PER CENT OF THE REPRESENTATION IN THE SENATE ALTHOUGH ITS POPULATION IS ONLY 33 PER CENT OF THAT OF THE STATE WHILE NEW HAVEN COUNTY CONTAINING 30 PER CENT OF THE POPULATION OF THE STATE ELECTS BUT I66 PER CENT OF THE SENATORS IN OTHER WORDS WITH A POPULATION NINE TIMES THAT OF TOLLAND COUNTY NEW HAVEN COUNTY CAN HAVE ONLY TWICE AS MANY MEMBERS IN THE UPPER HOUSE BUT IN SENATORIAL REPRESENTATION IT IS RHODE ISLAND THAT DOES THE GREATEST VIOLENCE TO THE SPIRIT OF EQUALITY WHILE CLINGING TO ITS LETTER AS IN THE FEDERAL SENATE SO HERE IS FOUND THE SAME REPRESENTATION FOR EACH POLITICAL UNIT FOR EACH TOWN WHATEVER ITS POPULATION AS A RESULT IN THE RHODE ISLAND SENATE JAMESTOWN WITH 707 INHABITANTS STANDS 260NEW ENGLAND LEGISLATIVE REPRESENTATION 65 THE PROUD PEER OF PROVIDENCE WITH A POPULATION OF 132146 NEW YORK AND NEVADA ARE NOT MORE UNEQUALLY MATED AT WASHINGTON IN THE LOWER HOUSES THE IDEA THAT EACH TOWN SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST ONE REPRESENTATIVE FINDS WIDER ACCEPTANCE EVEN IN MASSACHUSETTS WHERE REPRESENTATION IS PERIODICALLY REAPPOR TIONED AMONG DISTRICTS ACCORDING TO VOTING POPULATION CUSTOM WITH THE FORCE OF LAW DETERMINES THAT THERE SHALL BE ROTATION WITHIN THE DISTRICT SO THAT EACH TOWN SHALL HAVE ITS TURN IN SENDING AS REPRESENTATIVE ONE OF ITS OWN RESIDENTS ONCE IN EVERY FEW YEARS AT EACH REAPPORTIONMENT IN MAINE ONE REPRESENTATIVE IS GIVEN TO EACH TOWN OR DISTRICT FORMED BY THE UNION OF SEV ERAL SMALL TOWNS IN ACCORDANCE WITH A COMPLICATED RATIO OF INCREASE PRESCRIBED BY THE CONSTITUTION ADDITIONAL REPRE SENTATIVES ARE APPORTIONED AMONG THE LARGER TOWNS THE REPRESENTATION ADVANCES HOWEVER AT A SLOWER RATE THAN THE POPULATION SO THAT A TOWN OF 26250 INHABITANTS HAS BUT SEVEN REPRESENTATIVES AND THIS IS THE MAXIMUM NEW HAMPSHIRE TAKES THE PEOPLE INTO HER COUNCILS TO THE EXTENT OF GIVING ONE REPRESENTATIVE TO EVERY TOWN OR WARD OF A CITY HAVING 600 INHABITANTS MAKING 1200 THE  COMMON DIFFERENCE  FOR EACH MEMBER ADDED TO THE TOWNS DELEGATION THIS GIVES THE STATE WITH A POPULATION ONESIXTH SMALLER THAN THAT OF BOSTON A HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES LARGER BY OVER A HUNDRED THAN THAT OF ANY OTHER STATE LARGER BY SEVEN THAN THE LOWER HOUSE IN CONGRESS RHODE ISLAND SAFEGUARDS THE INTERESTS OF THE TOWNS BY GIVING TO EACH AT LEAST ONE REPRESENTATIVE AS THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE HOUSE IS LIMITED TO SEVENTYTWO THIS LEAVES A MARGIN OF THIRTYFIVE MEMBERS TO BE APPORTIONED AMONG THE TOWNS ACCORDING TO POPULATION BUT NO TOWN OR CITY MAY HAVE MORE THAN TWELVE THUS PROVIDENCE CAN HAVE BUT ONESIXTH OF THE HOUSE MEMBERSHIP ALTHOUGH CONTAINING ALREADY NEARLY TWOFIFTHS OF THE ENTIRE POPULATION OF THE STATE 26166 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY VERMONT IS THE ONLY STATE TO INSIST UPON ABSOLUTE EQUALITY OF REPRESENTATION IN THE HOUSE FOR ALL POLITICAL UNITS TO EACH OF HER 243 TOWNS IS GIVEN THE CHOICE OF ONE MEMBER BURLINGTON WITH A POPULATION OF 14590 RUTLAND WITH I I 760 SOMERSET WITH 6I AND BALTIMORE WITH 64 ARE ALL OF THE SAME HEIGHT IN THE HOUSE TWO LITTLE TOWNS ARE NOW WITHOUT REPRESENTATION PARTY DISSENSIONS PREVENTED AN ELEC TION IN MATTERS OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW CONNECTICUT DELIGHTS IN THE ANTIQUE RETAINING HER OLD CHARTER AS THE FUNDAMENTAL LAW FOR FORTY YEARS AFTER THE SEPARATION FROM ENGLAND IT WAS NOT UNTIL I8I8 THAT SHE FRAMED A CONSTITUTION FOR HERSELF SO FAR AS REPRESENTATION WAS CONCERNED ITS THEORY WAS THE THING THAT HATH BEEN IT IS THAT WHICH SHALL BE THE NUMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM EACH TOWN WAS FOREVER TO REMAIN THE SAME AS AT THAT DATE ANY NEW TOWN THAT MIGHT BE INCORPORATED HOWEVER WAS TO RECEIVE BUT ONE WHILE THE TOWNS FROM WHICH IT WAS MADE WERE NOT TO HAVE THEIR REP RESENTATIVE DIMINISHED WITHOUT THEIR OWN CONSENT AN AMENDMENT ADDED TWENTY YEARS AGO ALLOWS TWO MEMBERS THE MAXIMUM REPRESENTATION TO ANY TOWN OF 5000 AND OVER EVEN IF IT DOES NOT DATE FROM THE MOST ANCIENT TIMES BUT IT GUARANTEES TO ALL OTHER TOWNS THE REPRESENTATION WHICH THEY THEN HAD TWO YEARS LATER IT WAS PROVIDED THAT THEREAFTER A NEW TOWN SHOULD BE DEEMED TO BE MERELY AN ELECTION DIS TRICT OF THE TOWN FROM WHICH THE GREATER PART OF ITS TERRITORY IS TAKEN UNTIL EACH SHOULD CONTAIN AT LEAST 2500 INHABI TANTS IN THE FACE OF MOST URGENT AND PERSISTENT AGITATION FOR REPRESENTATION BASED ON SOME PRINCIPLE AND IN UTTER DISREGARD OF THE REVOLUTION WHICH EIGHTY YEARS HAVE MADE IN THE LOCALIZATION OF HER POPULATION CONNECTICUT STILL CONTINUES THIS PICKWICKIAN EQUALITY ITS EQUITY MAY BE SEEN BY COMPARING THE RELATIVE CHANGES IN THE POPULATION OF HALF A DOZEN TOWNS DURING THE DECADE PRECEDING THE LAST CENSUS 262NEW ENGLAND LEGISLATIVE REPRESENTATION 67 IS8O I890 NEW HAVEN  62882 86045 HARTFORD  45551 53230 BRIDGEPORT  29148 48866 HARTLAND  643 565 KILLINGWORTH  748 582 UNION   539 43R TO THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY EACH OF THESE TOWNS SENDS EXACTLY THE SAME NUMBER OF MEMBERS FOR THE SIMPLE AND SUFFICIENT REASON THAT IN THE YEAR 18I8 EACH SENT TWO IN NEW HAVEN THE RATIO OF REPRESENTATION FIVE YEARS AGO WAS 43022 INHABITANTS AS HER PEER IN THE HOUSE STOOD UNION WITH A RATIO OF I 215 THE THREE PRINCIPAL CITIES OF THE STATE CONTAINING MORE THAN ONEFOURTH OF ITS ENTIRE POPULATION MORE THAN ONETHIRD OF ITS TAXABLE WEALTH ELECTED SIX REP RESENTATIVES OUT OF 251 BUT EVEN THESE FIGURES DO NOT GIVE A FULL MEASURE OF THE  EQUALITY  OF CONNECTICUT REPRESENTA TION THE GROWTH OF CITIES IN THAT STATE HAS BEEN HARDLY MORE STRIKING THAN THE FALLING OFF IN POPULATION IN THE OLD COUNTRY TOWNS WHILE CONSERVATISM INTERESTED PARTISANSHIP AND THE CLASS FEELING OF THE RURAL POPULATION RESIST ALL ATTEMPTS TO REVISE THE ANTIQUATED CONSTITUTION OF I8I8 NATURAL CAUSES ARE BRINGING THE STATE GOVERNMENT UNDER A TYRANNY OF  THE DESERTED VILLAGE THAT BECOMES EVEN MORE OPPRESSIVE AND ODIOUS PUREMINDED MEN OF ALL PARTIES DEPLORE THE PREVALENCE OF CORRUPTION AMONG THE VOTERS OF CONNECTICUT BUT IT IS NOT AN INDEPENDENT PHENOMENON THE ANOMALOUS SYSTEM OF REPRESENTATION MAKES ALL THE EXTERNAL CONDITIONS FOR VIRTUE  OF THE WEAKEST SO LONG AS THE SECURING OF A MAJORITY IN A TOWN OF EIGHTY AND IN A CITY OF 20000 VOTERS BRINGS THE SAME POLITICAL ADVANTAGE IT NEED CAUSE NO SURPRISE THAT ELECTIONS IN THE COUNTRY TOWNS ARE CLOSE IT IS HERE THAT THE REAL CAMPAIGN IS FOUGHT MORAL SUASION TAKES VARIOUS FORMS MATTEROFFACT RUMOR NAMES I400 AS THE REGULAR PRICE OF VOTES IN ONE OF THE AFORESAID TOWNS WERE IT POSSIBLE TO FRAME DE NOVO A SYSTEM OF REPRESENTA TION FOR THE CONNECTICUT OF TODAY NO ONE WOULD DREAM OF 26368 ANNALS R0 THE AMERICAN ACADEMY ALLOWING ANY GROUP OF 500 INHABITANTS TO SEND TWO DELEGATES TO THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY BUT SO FIRM IS THE ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE INTERESTS OF PARTY AND OF THE COUNTRY TOWNS JEALOUS OF THEIR ANCESTRAL REPRESENTATION THAT THE CHAMPIONS OF REFORM DARE ADVOCATE NOTHING SO RADICAL AS THE DIMINISH ING OF ANY TOWNS PRESENT QUOTA IT IS PALLIATIVES NEW PATCHES UPON OLD GARMENTS THAT THEY URGE THERE IS NOW PENDING IN THE CONNECTICUT HOUSE A BILL INTRODUCED BY A NEW HAVEN MEMBER WHICH PROVIDES THAT  EACH TOWN OF 15000 SHALL BE ENTITLED TO THREE REPRESENTATIVES AND ANOTHER REPRESENTATIVE FOR EACH 5000 ADDITIONAL POPULATION WERE IT POSSIBLE FOR THIS BILL TO PASS IT WOULD INTRODUCE SOME ELASTICITY INTO THE SYSTEM FOR EXAMPLE IT WOULD RAISE THE REPRESENTATION OF NEW HAVEN FROM TWO TO TWENTY AND MAKE PROVISION FOR THE FUTURE EXPANSION OF CITIES BUT SUCH A MEASURE WOULD MAKE THE LEGISLATIVE BODY BUNGLINGLY LARGE ITS IMMEDIATE EFFECT WOULD BE TO RAISE THE MEMBERSHIP TO 300 AND A DECADE OR TWO WOULD MAKE THE HOUSE MORE UNWIELDY THAN THAT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE MOREOVER THIS BILL DOES NOT TOUCH ONE FUNDAMENTAL INJUSTICE WHILE IT MAKES THE CITY RATIO OF REPRESENTATION  5000 IT LEAVES TO THE GHOSTS OF ANCIENT TOWNS SO PREPOSTEROUS A RATIO AS I  200 IV TO WHAT EXTENT DOES EACH STATES SYSTEM OF REPRESENTA TION MAKE THE POLITICAL COMPLEXION OF THE LEGISLATURE VARY FROM THAT OF THE BODY OF THE VOTERS  STATE PARTIES ARE PRACTICALLY UNKNOWN FOR REASONS TOO FAMILIAR TO NEED ENUMERATION HERE NINE VOTERS OUT OF TEN IN A STATE ELECTION CAST THEIR BALLOTS IN UNQUESTIONING ALLEGIANCE TO PARTIES BASED ON TARIFF AND CURRENCY ISSUES HOWEVER SCHOLARS MAY CRITICISE SUCH POLITICAL ACTION AS UNREASONING AND DISASTROUS TO THE BEST INTERESTS OF STATE GOVERNMENT IT IS HARD TO DENY THE JUSTICE OF THE VOTERS CLAIM THAT THE REPRESENTATIVE BODY SHOULD REFLECT THEIR EXPRESSED WILL WITH THE LEAST POSSIBLE DISTORTION FROM THE MEDIA THROUGH WHICH IT PASSES THAT THERE MUST BE A CERTAIN  TOLERANCE NO ONE WILL DENY TO WHAT EXTENT THE ACTUAL DIVERGENCE IS DUE TO 264NEW ENGLAND LEGISLATIVE REPRESENTATION 69 DISTRICT VOTING IS A QUESTION THAT CANNOT BE ANSWERED WITH EXACTNESS STATISTICS GIVING THE TOTAL VOTE FOR ALL CANDIDATES OF THE SEVERAL PARTIES ARE OBTAINABLE FROM ONLY A FEW OF THE STATES SOMETHING OF AN APPROXIMATION MAY BE REACHED BY COMPARING PARTY STRENGTH AS FOUND IN THE LEGISLATIVE BODIES AND AS EXPRESSED IN THE VOTES FOR THE GOVERNORS CHOSEN AT THE SAME ELECTIONS IT MUST OF COURSE BE BORNE IN MIND THAT THE STATE ELECTIONS LAST NOVEMBER WERE BY NO MEANS TYPICAL THAT AN INDIVIDUAL CANDIDATE WHETHER FOR GOVERNER OR FOR LAW MAKER MAY RUN FAR AHEAD OF OR BEHIND HIS TICKET AND THAT THE MINOR POLITICAL PARTIES PUT FORWARD NO CANDIDATES FOR THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY IN MANY CONSTITUENCIES WHERE THEIR GUBER NATORIAL CANDIDATES POLLED

INFLUENCE OF CITIES  IN THE DISCUSSIONS WHICH AROSE OVER THE WORK OF THE RECENT CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION IN NEW YORK THE IMPRESSION SEEMED TO BE PREVALENT THAT SUCH A RESTRICTION AS THAT WHICH PREVENTS THE ELECTION OF MORE THAN ONEHALF OF THE LEGISLATURE BY THE TWO CITIES OF NEW YORK AND BROOKLYN WAS SOMETHING WITHOUT PRECEDENT YET SUCH IS BY NO MEANS THE CASE IN ALL OF THE NEW ENGLAND STATES BUT TWO MASSACHUSETTS AND NEW HAMPSHIRE THE CONSTITUTIONS FIX SOME MAXIMUM OF REPRESENTATION IN ONE HOUSE OR THE OTHER WHICH PUTS A SHARP LIMIT ON THE POLITICAL POWER OF ANY CITY THE ABSOLUTELY EQUAL REPRESENTATION FOR EACH TOWN IN THE VERMONT HOUSE AND IN THE RHODE ISLAND SENATE OF COURSE HAS THIS EFFECT IN CONNECTICUT THE EQUALLY FOSSILIZED BUT LESS SYMMETRICAL SYS TEM OF TOWN REPRESENTATION IN THE LOWER CHAMBER LIMITS TO TWO THE NUMBER OF MEMBERS FROM ANY CITY NO MATTER HOW LARGE IT MAY BECOME IN THE UPPER CHAMBER ALSO THE GIVING OF A LARGE MINIMUM REPRESENTATION TO EACH COUNTY CUTS DOWN THE MARGIN TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT NO COUNTY CONTAINING A LARGE CITY CAN BE REPRESENTED IN PROPORTION TO ITS POPULATION IN THE MAINE HOUSE NO TOWN MAY HAVE MORE THAN SEVEN MEMBERS IN RHODE ISLAND THE LIMIT IS FIXED AT TWELVE IN MAINE AND VERMONT WHERE THE POPULATION IS MOSTLY RURAL AND CHANGES BUT SLOWLYVERMONTS POPULATION GAINED BUT ONEHALF OF ONE PER CENT DURING THE LAST CENSUS DECADE THIS RESTRICTION DOES NOT MAKE ITSELF VERY OPPRESSIVE BUT IN THE LEGISLATURES OF BOTH RHODE ISLAND AND CONNECTICUT SUCH NARROW LIMITS ARE PLACED UPON CITY REPRESENTATION AS TO WORK GROSS INJUSTICE TO THAT PART OF THE POPULATION WHICH IS STEADILY AND RAPIDLY ON THE INCREASE TODAY MORE THAN HALF OF THE INHABITANTS OF CONNECTICUT LIVE IN CITIES OF I5OOO AND OVER YET THESE ELECT LESS THAN ONETENTH OF THE MEMBERS IN THE SOCALLED POPULAR  CHAMBER SUCH FACTS AS THE FOREGOING WOULD SEEM TO SHOW THAT EVEN IN ONE OF THE OLDEST AND MOST HOMOGENEOUS SECTIONS OF THE 266NEW ENGLAND LEGISLATIVE REPRESENTATION 71 COUNTRY THE FEDERAL SUFFRAGE IS CONFERRED ON VERY DIFFERENT TERMS THAT THE ASSEMBLIES WHICH ELECT FEDERAL SENATORS DIFFER WIDELY IN SIZE IN PERSONNEL AND IN THE BASIS UPON WHICH THEY ARE ELECTED AND THAT ALTHOUGH EQUAL REPRESENTATION IS THE IDEAL SET UP BY THE CONSTITUTIONS THERE IS UTTER DISAGREE MENT AS TO WHAT CONSTITUTES EQUALITY OF REPRESENTATION WHILE IN THEIR ATTEMPTS TO REALIZE IT MOST OF THE STATES BY CLINGING TO ITS LETTER HAVE SACRIFICED ITS SPIRIT GEORGE H HAYNES WORCESTER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE

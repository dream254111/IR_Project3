YEAR 1721 BY HENRY BEIGHTON F R S INSCRIBED TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY T H E PRINCIPAL END AND DESIGN OF WRITING OR PUBLISHING SHOULD BE TO CONVEY DOWN SOME USEFUL KNOWLEDGE TO THE REST OF MANKIND SINCE IT IS WHAT WE ARE INDEBTED TO COMMUNICATE OUR TALENTS IN RETURN FOR THOSE HELPS WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM OTHERS WHOEVER WRITES ON ANY OF THE PRACTICAL PARTS OF THE MATHEMATICS HIS CHIEF END AND AIM SHOULD BE AT ONE OR BOTH OF THESE TWO THINGS CERTAINTY AND EXPEDITION WHEREIN CONSISTS THE VERY LIFE AND BEAUTY OF A SCIENCE THAT TIME AND OBSERVATION HAVE PRODUCED BETTER INSTRUMENTS OR IMPROVEMENTS IS A TRUTH NOT TO BE DENIED BUT AT THE SAME TIME THAT THERE MAY BE NEW INSTRUMENTS AND YET WORSE IS EQUALLY TRUE THE EAGER THIRST AFTER AND HUMOUR FOR THINGS NEW AND IN VOGUE HAVE SOMETIMES BEEN THE OCCASION OF REJECT ING SOME OLD INVENTIONS MUCH SUPERIOR TO THE NEW ONES IN PRACTICE WHAT I HAVE TO SAY ON THE SUBJECT AND TO MAKE GOOD WHAT I HAVE BEEN AIMING AT SHALL BE IN THE PRACTICAL PART OF SURVEYING VIZ THE TAKING OF PLANS OR MAPS AND HERE PERHAPS I MAY BE THOUGHT TO NEED AN APOLOGY IN SEEMING TO PROPOSE A NEW INSTRUMENT WHILST I AM BLAMING OTHERS FOR THE SAME THING BUT WHEN I TELL YOU MINE IS AN OLD INSTRU 5 E MENT748 MENT IMPROVED WHERE I HAVE OBVIATED ALL THE DIFFI CULTIES THAT HITHERTO ATTENDED IT AND MADE IT TO ANSWER ALL THE OBJECTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED AGAINST IT AND DEMONSTRATE THAT IT IS SUBSERVIENT TO ALL PARTS OF THE ART FOR WHICH SUCH INSTRUMENTS ARE DESIGNED I MAY IN SOME MEASURE SEEM TO BE JUSTIFIED THE INSTRUMEN TIS WHAT HAS BEEN HITHERTO CALLED THE PLAIN TABLE ONE OF THE CHIEF OBJECTIONS AGAINST IT WAS THE DIFFICULTY IN SHIFTING OF PAPERS FOR YOU WERE ALMOST NECESSITATED WHEN YOU WERE AT WORK ON A SHEET IN THE TABLE TO PUT IN ALL THE WORK THAT IS TO BE CONTAINED THEREON BECAUSE IT IS VERY IMPRACTICABLE TO PUT IT ON THE TABLE IN THE SAME PRECISE POSITION AGAIN AND THIS ALTHOUGH IT WERE WITH THE UTMOST INCONVENIENCY IN PURSUING SOME GRAND STATION ON CIRCUMSCRIBING THE WHOLE THIS IS IN TIRELY OBVIATED AND I HAVE REMEDIED ALL THE OTHER OBJECTIONS AGAINST IT AS MAY BE SEEN HEREAFTER IN A VERY SIMPLE AND EASY MANNER WHICH I CONTRIVED IN THE YEAR 1721 FOR MAKING A CORRECT MAP OF THE COUNTY OF WARWICK BY WHICH WITH GOOD SUCCESS AND EXPEDITION I COMPLETED AND PUBLISHED THE SAME IN THE YEAR 1728 AND CALL THE INSTRUMENT THE PLOTTINGTABLE GRIFF JULY 14 1739 HENRY BEIGHTON A DESCRIPTION OF THE PLOTTINGTABLE IT IS A PLAIN SMOOTH BOARD ABOUT 18 INCHES SQUARE AND THREEQUARTERS OF AN INCH THICK AS T A B I FIG 1 A B C D MADE OF MAHOGANY WALNUT PEARTREE OR NORWAY OAK WELL CLAMPED AT THE ENDS OR749 OR A BRASS FRAME ROUND IT TO PREVENT ITS WARPING AND AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE SHRINKING AND SWELLING WITHIN SIXTENTHS OF AN INCH OF TWO OF ITS OP POSITE SIDES AND PARALLEL TO THEM AND ONE ANOTHER ARE TWO GROOVES E F G H CUT ON THE FACE HALF AN INCH DEEP TO LET IN TWO BRASS HOLDERS IN THE SHAPE OF N O FIG 2 WHICH ARE EACH OF ONE PIECE OF CAST BRASS LIKE TWO BRASS RULERS JOINED TOGETHER AT RIGHT ANGLES THE PERPENDICULAR PART IS ONETENTH AND THREE HUNDREDTH PARTS OF AN INCH THICK AS AT D HALF AN INCH DEEP AND A LITTLE SHORTER AT EACH END THAN THE UPPER PART WHICH IS 17 INCHES LONG THREETENTHS BROAD AND ABOUT EIGHT PARTS OF AN HUNDREDTH OF AN INCH THICK ABOUT TWO INCHES AND AN HALF FROM EACH END OF THE HOLDER ARE THICK PARTS OR BOSSES IN THE UPRIGHT PIECE AS AT P AND Q THROUGH WHICH ARE HOLES TAPPED TO RECEIVE THE SKREWS P S Q R WHICH SCREWS GO EACH THROUGH A BRASS PLATE AS T AND V FIXED BY RIVETS ON THE UNDER SIDE OF THE TABLE AND LITTLE ROUND NUTS AS AT A AND B PUT ON THEM TO CONFINE THEM TO THEIR SHOULDERS IN TURNING IN THE PLATES THAT THEY NEITHER RISE NOR FALL THESE HOLDERS MUST GO EASY IN THE GROOVES TO SINK EASY AND EVEN WITH THE UPPER SURFACE OF THE TABLE THEN WHEN THE SCREWS ENTER THE HOLES OF THE HOLDERS BY TURNING R AND S AT THE SAME TIME FORWARD THE HOLDERS WILL FALL AND PINCH DOWN ANY PAPERS  C THAT ARE UNDER THEM AND TURNING BACKWARD WILL RISE AND RELEASE THEM IN THE MIDDLE OF ONE END OF THE TABLE IS A GROOVE TO RECEIVE THE BRASS W WHICH HAS THE SAME SORT OF SCREW AND FIXING AS THE OTHER TO RAISE OR FALL IT BUT THE GROOVE IS QUADRANTAL THAT THE HOLDER W MAY ON OCCASION BE TURNED SO AS TO LIE ALL ON THE OUTSIDE THE 5 E 2 LINE750 LINE E H AND TO CROSS IT IN CASE OF HIGH WINDS FOR SECURING THE PAPERS DOWN ON THREE SIDES AND A FOURTH MIGHT BE ADDED BUT THERE IS SELDOM ANY OCCASION FOR IT TO THE CENTRE OF THE TABLE UNDERNEATH IS FIXED A BRASS SOCKET SO TRULY MADE THAT THE TABLE MAY WHEN SET TURN ROUND TRULY HORIZONTALLY AND A MA CHINE CASED WITH GLASS IN WHICH A PLUMBET HANGS TO SET THE TABLE LEVEL OR THE PARALLEL PLATES AND GLASS TUBES OF SPIRIT OF WINE MAY BE USED TO SET IT HORIZONTAL AS ANY ONE SEES OCCASION TO FANSY THEM TO ANY ONE OF THE FOUR EDGES UNDERNEATH IS SCREWED A BOX AND NEEDLE SET TO THE VARIATION THERE BELONGS TO THIS INSTRUMENT A STRONG THREE LEGGED STAFF AND AN INDEX WITH PLAIN OR TELESCOPICAL SIGHTS NEAR TWO FEET LONG THE PAPERS OR CHARTS FOR THIS TABLE ARE TO BE EITHER A THIN FINE PASTBOARD FINE PAPER PASTED ON CARTRIDGEPAPER OR TWO PAPERS PASTED TOGETHER CUT AS EXACTLY SQUARE AS IS POSSIBLE EACH SIDE BEING NEARLY 16 INCHES AND AN HALF LONG JUST AS THEY MAY SLIDE IN EASILY BETWEEN THE UPRIGHT PART AND UNDER THE FLAT PART OF THE HOLDERS ANY ONE OF THESE CHARTS WILL BE PUT IN THE TABLE ANY OF THE FOUR WAYS BE FIXED TAKEN OUT AND CHANGED AT PLEASURE ANY TWO OF THEM MAY BE JOINED TOGETHER TRUE ON THE TABLE IF YOU MAKE EACH OF THEM MEET EXACT AT THE LINE L M WHILST NEAR ONE HALF OF EACH WILL HANG OVER INFERREDTHEINFERRED SIDES OF THE TABLE OR BY CRESTING AND DOUBLING EACH THE WHOLE OF THEM WILL BE WITHIN THE TABLE AND IF OCCASION SHOULD HAPPEN AS SELDOM IT DOES BY CRESTING EACH PAPER BOTH WAYS THROUGH THE MIDDLE FOUR OF THEM MAY BE751 BE PUT ON AT ONE TIME MEETING IN THE CENTRE OF THE TABLE EACH CHART IS ALWAYS CROSSED BY RIGHT ANGLES THROUGH THE MIDDLE FOR THE PURPOSE ABOVE AND TO MAKE ANY OF THEM ANSWER TO THE GUIDELINES ON THE TABLE FIG 1 I K L M DRAWN QUITE THROUGH THE CENTRE AND THE WHOLE TABLESO THE GRAND OB JECTION OF SHIFTING PAPERS IS OBVIATED ITS FACILITY AND DISPATCH AS ALSO ITS CERTAINTY COMPARED WITH ANY OF THE MOST CELEBRATED INSTRUMENTS I SHALL NOW BRIEFLY SET FORTH BUT IN ORDER THERETO IT MAY NOT BE IMPROPER TO TO PREMISE OR LAY DOWN AS LEMMATA THESE THREE THINGS 1 THE ESSENTIAL BUSINESS OR AIM IN SURVEYING OF LANDS OR COUNTRIES IS EITHER TO HAVE AN EXACT PLAN OR TO FIND THE AREA IN SOME KNOWN MEASURE 2 EVERY THING THAT IS SUPERFLUOUS OR FOREIGN TO SUCH DESIGN IS BETTER OMITTED THAN TAKEN 3 IF A TRUE SURVEY AND EXACT PLAN BE MADE EVERY PART WILL HAVE ITS JUST PROPORTION AND EVERY ANGLE ITS TRUE OPENING OR QUAN TITY THEN WHAT NEED HAVE WE OF DEGREES MINUTES C THEY ARE NEVER MADE ANY USE OF IN THE PRACTICE OF CASTING UP OR ANY THING RELATED THERETO FOR IF FROM A STATION TWO LINES BE DRAWN BY A GOOD INDEX TO TWO DISTANT OBJECTS WILL IT NOT BE THE752 THE VERY ANGLE AND IDENTICALLY THE SAME AS IF IT HAD BEEN TAKEN BY THE MOST CELEBRATED INSTRUMENT IN DEGREES AND MINUTES AND LAID DOWN BY A PROTRACTOR THE FIRST IS MUCH MORE EXPEDITIOUS EASY AND CER TAIN THAN THE OTHER MORE EXPEDITIOUS BECAUSE THOSE TWO LINES ARE SOONER DRAWN THAN AN ANGLE CAN BE TAKEN WHICH DONE TWO THIRDS OF THE WORK IS BEHIND VIZ WRITING DOWN AND PLOTTING MORE EASY AS DONE WITH ONEFOURTH OF THE TROUBLE MORE CERTAIN BECAUSE ONE MAY BE LIABLE TO MISTAKES IN TAKING THE DEGREES OR MINUTES IN SETTING DOWN AND IN PROTRACTING AND IF IT SHOULD SO HAPPEN THAT ONE NUMERICAL ANGLE SHOULD BE TAKEN SET DOWN  PLOTTED TO THE WRONG COAST WHERE THEY DEPEND ON ONE ANOTHER SO GREAT AN ERROR WOULD ENSUE THAT COULD NOT BE RETRIEVABLE BUT BY GOING ON THE SPOT AND PERFORMING THE OPERATION ANEW NOW THE PLOTTINGTABLE AFTER TWO STATIONS PROVES EVERY THING ON THE SPOT FOR FROM EVERY STATION YOU ARE UPON THE INDEX MUST POINT AT THE SAME TIME TO ANY STATION ON YOUR MAP AND ITS CORRESPONDING OB JECT IN THE FIELD WHICH IS A DEMONSTRATIVE PROOF FOR NOTHING BUT TRUTH WILL AGREE IN SEVERAL BRANCHES OF THE MATHEMATICS IT IS AB SOLUTELY NECESSARY TO TAKE ANGLES IN DEGREES MINUTES AND THEIR SUBDIVISIONS AS ASTRONOMY TRIGONOMETRY NAVIGATION LONGIMETRY INACCESSIBLE HEIGHTS AND DISTANCES C AND ALSO IN TAKING LARGE PLANS TO CALCULATE AND PROVE THINGS BY TRIGONOMETRY WHICH WOULD NOT ONLY BE A WORK OF CURIOSITY BUT VERY COMMENDABLE BUT WHERE THE NATURE OF THE THING WILL ADMIT OF AS GOOD PROOF WITH ONETENTHPART OF THE TROUBLE AND TIME IT WOULD BE LIKE RUNNING THE SO753 SOLUTION OF AN EASY QUESTION INTO A LONG PROCESS OF ALGEBRA OR FLUXIONS WHEN THE PLAIN RULE OF PROPOR TION WOULD JUSTLY ANSWER THE SAME IT IS OBJECTED THAT IN SURVEYING BY THE PLOTTING TABLE THE SHRINKING OR SWELLING OF THE PAPERS ARE A GREAT INCONVENIENCY IN ANSWER TO THIS IT MAY BE SAID THE SAME INCON VENIENCY ATTENDS THE SURVEYING BY ANY OTHER INSTRU MENT SO SOON AS IT IS PLOTTED FOR BOTH VELUMN AND PAPER WILL SHRINK AND SWELL IN THE HOUSE ON THE AL TERATION OF WEATHER AS WELL AS ALL BODIES FOR A LINE OF 48 CHAINS PLOTTED BY A SCALE OF 32 PER INCH IN A HAZY MORNING IN A CLEAR AFTERNOON THE SAME DAY MEASURED BUT 47 AND AN HALF AND THERE ARE VARIOUS SHRINKINGS AND SWELLINGS ACCORDING TO THE WEATHER AND DIFFERENCE OF PAPER C IN THE PLOTTINGTABLE THIS INCONVENIENCY IS IN A GREAT MEASURE REMEDIED FOR IN WHAT STATE SOEVER OF THE WEATHER YOU PUT LINES ON THE CHART THE HOLDERS GIVE MARKS ON THE CHART AS IT THEN STOOD IF IT WAS MOIST AND SWELLED UP IN THE MIDDLE PART YOU MAY WHEN YOU EITHER CAST UP OR MEASURE LINES BY LAYING IT ON A DAMP FLOOR PUT IT IN THE SAME CONDI TION AS IT WAS WHEN YOU PLOTTED THE LINES IF YOU PLOTTED IN DRY HOT WEATHER AND ARE CASTING UP IN DAMP OR MOIST A LITTLE HEATING BY THE FIRE WILL REDUCE IT TO THE SAME STATE AGAIN ANOTHER REMEDY I HAVE LONG USED IS TO PLOT AND MEASURE BY SCALES OF THE SAME PAPER WHICH WILL SHRINK OR SWELL IN PROPORTION AS YOUR MAP DOES BUT IT WILL BE WELL TO OBSERVE HERE THAT THE SHRINK ING AND SWELLING ALTERS THE LINES ONLY AND NOT AT ALL THE ANGLES FOR LET A POLYGON BE NEVER SO MUCH UNI754 UNIFORMLY EXTENDED OR CONTRACTED EACH ANGLE MUST CONTAIN THE SAME NUMBER OF DEGREES AND MINUTES AS BEFORE HENCE THIS OBJECTION FALLS NO HARDER ON THE TABLE THAN ON ALL OTHER INSTRUMENTS AND HERE I INTENDED TO HAVE ENDED THIS DISCOURSE BUT AS I HAVE SOME OTHER SMALL IMPROVEMENTS NOT ONLY IN THE INSTRUMENTAL PART BUT IN A NEW METHOD OF DISPOSING THE MAPS AND BETTER ADAPTING THEM TO ALL SUBSERVIENT USES I PROCEED I SHOULD HAVE SAID BEFORE THAT EACH CHART HAS A FLOWER DE LYS ON ITS NORTH EDGE AND AS THE NEEDLE IS MOVEABLE TO ANY SIDE CARE MUST BE TAKEN THAT THE NORTH END OF THE NEEDLE WHEN IT STANDS SHOULD POINT THE SAME WAY AS THE FLOWER DE LYS ON THE CHARTS I USE A NEEDLE ABOUT FIVE INCHES LONG PLACED IN AN OBLONG WOODEN BOX BUT JUST SO WIDE AS THE NEEDLE MAY PLAY DOUBLE THE DEGREES OF THE VARIATION WEST VIZ 30 IN THE MIDDLE OF ONE END IS THE FLOWER DE LYS AND THE BOX IS BY STUDS AND HOLES ALWAYS PUT ON THE TABLE OBLIQUE TO THE QUANTITY OF THE MAG NETICAL VARIATION I MAKE NO OTHER USE OF THE NEEDLE THAN TO SET THE TABLE IN THE MERIDIAN AND TO PREVENT ANY GREAT MISTAKES IN JOINING OR PLACING THE CHARTS WRONG I HAVE NO MORE THAN HALF AN INCH OF THE NEEDLE THAT APPEARS FROM UNDER THE TABLE FOR THE REASON IT SHOULD NOT BE IN THE WAY OR SO SUBJECT TO BE DAMAGED THE MAKING THE BOX SO NARROW IS TO CHECK ITS PLAY ING THAT IT MAY SOONER HANG STILL OVER THE FLOWER DE LYS THE WOODEN BOX LINED WITH PAPER I FIND PRE FERABLE TO A LARGE BRASS BOX AND LARGE GLASS WHICH IN755 IN COLD AND HAZY WEATHER CONDENSES THE VAPOUR AND AIR SO MUCH AS TO MAKE THE NEEDLE VERY LANGUID AND DULL FARTHER USES BY TAKING A SURVEY IN THE NEW METHOD BY THE PLOTTINGTABLE THE CHARTS THUS TAKEN ARE MORE READILY LAID TO GETHER BY NUMBERS ON THEIR EDGES WHICH TALLY AND MAKE UP THE WHOLE MAP IN ONE PLAN OR VIEW AND ARE IN THESE SQUARES MORE PORTABLE IN THE SECOND PLACE THEY ARE MORE READILY COPIED EXTENDED OR CONTRACTED FOR BY HAVING A FRAME OF WOOD THAT JUST ENCOMPASSES A CHART DIVIDED BY 19 THREADS AT EQUAL DISTANCES AND THE SAME AT RIGHT ANGLES THE OTHER WAY EACH FIVE OR TEN C BE ING DISTINGUISHED BY SILK OF A DIFFERENT COLOUR A REET IS MADE OF 400 GEOMETRICAL SQUARES FROM WHICH HAVING A VELUMN OR PAPER SO DIVIDED BY LESSER OR GREATER SQUARES THEN DRAWING OR COPYING BY HELP OF THE LINES INTO THOSE NEW SQUARES YOU HAVE YOUR TRUE MAP CONTRACTED OR EXTENDED LARGE MAPS OF LORDSHIPS ARE NOT ANY WAYS CON VENIENT OR PORTABLE TO HAVE RECOURSE TO ON THE SPOT OR PLACE THEY REPRESENT BEING SUBJECT TO DAMAGES UNFIT TO BE OPENED IN RAINY WEATHER VERY TROUBLE SOME IN THE WIND AND VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND OUT THE PART YOU WANT TO REMEDY ALL THESE INCONVENI ENCES SOME YEARS AGO I CONTRIVED A NEW METHOD OF DISPOSING THEM IN SUCH MANNER AS MAKES THEM MORE SURE SAFE READY CONVENIENT DURABLE AND PORTABLE THAN ANY OTHER METHOD 5 F AND756 AND THIS IS DONE BY IMITATING THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE WORLD WHICH FIRST GIVES THE WHOLE THEN THE SEVERAL KINGDOMS COUNTRIES PROVINCES AND MINUTER PARTS AND DIVISIONS SEVERALLY AND MORE AT LARGE FIRST IT WILL BE HIGHLY NECESSARY THAT A GENERAL MAP OF THE WHOLE LORDSHIP COUNTRY C BE DRAWN IN ONE SHEET OF PAPER OR VELUMN TO GIVE THE FORM IDEA AND PROPORTION THAT THE PARTS BEAR TO THE WHOLE AND ONE ANOTHER BY WHICH SITUATIONS BEAR INGS OF THE TOWNS VILLAGES ROADS AND REMARKABLE PLACES WILL BE SEEN AT ONE VIEW AND THIS MUST BE REDUCED TO SO SMALL A SCALE AS THE INTENDED SHEET MAY COMPREHEND THE WHOLE A SCALE OF ABOUT 11 OR 12 CHAINS IN AN INCH WILL PLOT A LORDSHIP OF MORE THAN 2000 ACRES IN THE COMPASS OF 16 INCHES AND ONE QUARTER SQUARE WHICH MAY BE A CONVENIENT SIZE TO MAKE TWO LEAVES AND OPEN IN A FOLIO BOOK THIS MAP MAY EXPRESS THE ROADS RIVERS STREETS BOUNDARIES INCLOSURES AND COMMON FIELD LANDS SINGLY IN CASE THEY BE NOT LESS THAN 40 OR 50 LINKS IN BREADTH THE PIECES THAT CONTAIN NOT LESS THAN ABOUT 10 ACRES WILL ADMIT OF ROOM TO WRITE THE OWNERS NAMES AND QUANTITIES IN STATUTE MEASURE AS IN FIG 4 BUT FOR ALL THE SMALL PARTS THERE WILL NOT BE ROOM TO EXPLAIN THEM THEREFORE I DIVIDE THE GENERAL MAP INTO AS MANY GEOME TRICAL SQUARES AS IT TOOK CHARTS IN SURVEYING BY THE TABLE BY RED LINES AS IN FIG 3 HORIZONTALLY AND PERPENDICULARLY AS NOTED BY OOOO C WHICH BY A SCALE OF 32 PER INCH MAY TAKE ABOUT 15 CHARTS IN NUMBER IN THE OPENEST PLACE NEAR THE MIDDLE OF EACH SQUARE IN A SMALL CIRCLE I NUMBER THEM WITH RED FIGURES 123 C CORRESPONDING TO THE ORIGINAL CHARTS757 CHARTS AND IN THE MIDDLE OF EACH OF THEIR SIDES NUMERICAL LETTERS SHEWING HOW THE PARTICULAR MAPS ARE TO JOIN TO EACH OTHER THE PARTICULAR MAPS ARE EACH AS LARGE AS THE GENERAL AND NUMBERED AT THE TOP I II III C CORRESPOND ING TO THE SQUARES IN GENERAL AS FIG 4 WHERE IN THE RIGHT HAND MARGIN IS PUT V AND AT THE BOTTOM IX SHEWING THE FIFTH MAP TALLIES TO THE SIDE AND THE NINTH TO THE BOTTOM OR SOUTH PART THE GENERAL MAP BEING AN INDEX SHEWING HOW THEY JOIN TO EACH OTHER BY THESE PARTICULAR MAPS MAY BE SHEWN ALL THE LESSER QUANTITIES WITH THEIR TENURE OWNERS NAMES AND CONTENTS AND BY THE SCALE ARE CAPABLE OF SHEW ING THE LENGTHS OF ANY LINES AND THE DIMENSIONS SO AS TO DISCOVER ANY ENCROACHMENTS AND RECORD THEIR SHAPE AND EXTENTS TO POSTERITY A MOST VALUABLE USE OF A SURVEY AND MAP ALL THESE MAPS ARE BOUND UP IN ORDER IN A FOLIO BOOK TO OPEN FREELY WHICH WILL BE NOT ONLY VERY PORTABLE BUT USEFUL TO HAVE RECOURSE TO ON ANY OC CASION SECURE FROM DAMAGES OF WEATHER AS WELL AS MORE DURABLE AND ORNAMENTAL THE TERRIERS TO THESE MAPS ARE MADE IN THE FOL LOWING MANNER EITHER BOUND IN A BOOK OF A POCKET SIZE BY THEMSELVES OR ALONG WITH THE MAPS

TOP AND 6 ON THE LEFT SIDE AND IN THE ANGLE OF MEETING OF THOSE SQUARES IS THE HOUSE CLOSE AND SO FOR ANY OTHER THERE IS BUT ONE OBJECTION I CAN AT PRESENT FORESEE THAT CAN BEAR ANY WEIGHT AGAINST THIS METHOD OF DIVIDING THE GENERAL MAP VIZ THAT BY DIVIDING THE SAME INTO GEOMETRICAL SQUARES MANY OF THE PARCELS LANDS AND GROUNDS WILL BE CUT INTO TWO SEPARATE PIECES ONE PART WHEREOF WILL LIE IN ONE PARTICULAR MAP AND THE REST IN759 IN ANOTHER AS IN FIG 4 MAP IV PART OF CALMER AND BROADCLOSE WILL BE IN THE VTH MAP IN THIS CASE IT IS USUAL TO PUT THE OWNERS NAME AND QUANTITY IN THAT WHICH IS THE GREATER PART AND IN THE TERRIER REFER ALSO TO THE REMAINDER WHERE IF THE SHAPE LENGTHS C ARE REQUIRED THEY MAY BE DISCOVERED BUT AS THIS MAY NOT BE SATISFACTORY OR FULLY ANSWER THE OBJECTION THE TWO FOLLOWING METHODS WILL INTIRELY OBVIATE THE DIFFICULTY AND MAKE THEM AS FULLY SUBSERVIENT TO ALL PURPOSES AS ANY LARGE AND INTIRE MAP ON ONE PIECE 1 THE FIRST METHOD IS TO TAKE JUST SO MUCH IN A PARTICULAR MAP AS IS CIRCUMSCRIBED BY SOME KNOWN ROADS LANES BROOKS BOUNDARIES OF PARTICULAR OWNERS OR TENANTS LANDS THIS INDEED WILL OFTEN MAKE THE MAP VERY DISPROPORTIONAL AND IRREGULARLY SHAPED BUT CANNOT BE A MATERIAL OBJECTION BY REASON IN SURVEYS THERE IS SELDOM ANY THING REGU LARLY SHAPED 2 THE SECOND METHOD IS TO HAVE A WIDER MARGIN OR RATHER DRAW THE PARTICULAR MAPS BY A SMALLER SCALE AS FOUR CHAINS IN AN INCH INSTEAD OF THREE CHAINS 20 LINES AND THAT WILL ALLOW ROOM TO ADD THE PARTS OF THE PARCELS SO CUT OFF IN THE MARGIN AS IN FIG 5 THE IVTH PARTICULAR MAP VARIED WHERE THE WHOLE OF BROADMOOR AND CALMER IS DRAWN THEN IN THE VTH AND IXTH PARTICULAR MAP MAY THE SMALL PARTS WHICH ARE IN THE IVTH BE DRAWN IN FULL THEN WILL THEY JOIN BY INDENTING OR TALLYING ONE INTO ANOTHER TOTO REDUCE A SCALE TO FIT EXACTLY YOUR GENERAL MAP FIRST SEE WHAT EXTENT THE WHOLE SURVEY TAKES ON THE CHARTS YOU LAID IT DOWN BY IN THE FIELD VIZ THE GREATEST DEPTH AND BREADTH AS FROM THE SPECIMEN OF THE GENERAL MAP IT MAY APPEAR DEPTH BREADTH ON THE UPPER CHART IS NO 2  10 INCHESNO 8  5 INCHES NO 6 16 14 12 NO 9 16 14 12 NO 11 16 14 12 10 16 14 12 NO 13 10 12 11 16 14 12  7 6 12 THE WHOLE 53 14  THE WHOLE 60 12 12 QR THEN HAVING FIXED ON THE SIZE OF THE GENERAL MAP TO BE 1637 SQUARE I FORM A SCALE OF 60 12 PER INCH THAT MAY JUST EXTEND THE WHOLE BREADTH OF THE 16 37 INCHES BY WHICH YOU MAY FORM ALL THE SQUARES AND PARTS OF SQUARES IN DEPTH AND LENGTH AS ABOVE AND AT FIG 3 IS DIVIDED THE BREADTH OF THE WHOLE MAP BY A SCALE OF 32 IS 6062 INCHES WHICH I WOULD REDUCE INTO THE COM PASS OF 16 14 AND 12  1637 INCHES DIVIDE 6062 BY 1637 GIVES 37 WHICH MULTIPLIED BY 320 MAKES THE PRODUCT 1184 THAT IS 11 CHAINS 84 KINKS IN AN INCH THE SCALE FOR THE GENERAL MAP THUS HAVE I DONE ALL I INTENDED BUT SHALL OBSERVE THAT SEVERAL OF THESE TABLES HAVE BEEN MADE AND AS PEOPLE HAVE FANISED WITH ALTERATIONS AND ADDITIONS BUT ALL VARIATIONS ARE NOT REALLY IMPROVEMENTS THE SETTING IT HORIZONTALLY BY SPIRIT TUBES MAY BE CURIOUS ENOUGH BUT AS THE DIFFERENCE IS VERY INCON SIDERABLE AND INDISCERNIBLE WHEN IT STANDS TWO OR761 OR THREE DEGREES OUT OF THE LEVEL I SHALL NOT TROUBLE MYSELF OR OTHERS ABOUT IT ONLY FURTHER OBSERVE THAT WHEN GROUNDS ARE DECLINING MUCH AND VERY UNEVEN IF THE TABLE STANDS HORIZONTAL UNLESS THE SIGHT OR MARK ON THE LOWER PART IS SO HIGH AS ITS TOP MAKES A LEVEL WITH THE UPPER PART OF THE TABLE WHICH IS SELDOM DONE OR PRACTICABLE I DO NOT SEE WHY SUCH A STRESS SHOULD BE LAID ON THE INSTRUMENTS BEING LEVEL WHEN NEITHER THE VIEW BY THE INDEX NOR THE MEA SURE OF THE LINE EITHER CAN BE OR IS TAKEN HORIZON TALLY IF THE SIGHT OF THE INDEX STAND NEARLY PERPEN DICULAR AT EVERY OBSERVATION IT IS MORE THAN SUFFI CIENT FOR ANY EXACTNESS REQUISITE IN A SURVEY

the power of appointment was not exercised but even with that construction this decision is contrary to the principles in Williams v Mears 2 Disn Ohio 604 and Adams v Guerard 29 Ga 651 76 Am Dec 624 though in accord with the weight of authority The dissenting opinion said that the heirs would have succeeded to the estate by force of the deed of trust without any other conveyance Under this interpretation the estate of the heirs would be legal and the rule in Shelleys Case could not apply KALES FUTURE INTEREST  129 Ryan et al v Allcei I2o Ill 641 F 0 THE RIGHT OF THE GARNISHEE TO DISPOSE OF GOODS IN HIS POSSESSION WHILE THE LITIGATION IS PENDINGThe plaintiffs were rice growers and had delivered a large quantity of rice to a milling company under a contract with the latter to mill and prepare the rice for market and sell the same The plaintiffs were sued and the milling company summoned as garnishee The latter refused to proceed with the milling and sale of the rice believing that the effect of the garnishment summons was to suspend their rights under their contract with the plaintiffs Finally the court ordered the com pany to proceed with the sale but in the meantime the price of rice had de clined and a loss ensued The garnishment proved to be wrongful and the plaintiffs brought suit against the surety on the garnishment bond to recover the amount lost through the decline in the price during the pendency of the garnishment proceedings Held that the milling company was bound to proceed with their contract regardless of the garnishment that the gar nishing creditor was merely substituted to the rights of the principal debtor under the contract that therefore the loss was caused by the failure of the milling company to fulfill its obligation and was not proximately caused by the wrongful garnishment Moore  Bridgeman v United States Fidelity  Guaranty Co I9o8  Tex Civ App  113 S W 947 This case involves a question upon which it is very difficult to find cases directly in point In fact the two cases cited as authority in the principal case Mensing v Engelke 67 Tex 532 4 S W 202 and McClellan v Routh I5 Tex Civ App 344 39 S W 607 appear so far as is disclosed by the report of the principal case to involve a state of facts very different from that here involved The former involved a garnishment where the goods were already subject to a pledge while in the latter equities of a similar nature were involved As to pledges and preexisting mortgages it is held that the rights of the garnishing creditor are subsequent thereto Cooley v Minnesota Etc Ry Co 53 Minn 327 55 N W 141 39 Am St Rep 609 But such is not the question in this case The principal case involves the question whether a garnishee having in his possession goods of another under a contract to prepare and market the same is at liberty to proceed under his contract and dispose of such goods after being summoned as garnishee or whether he shall hold such goods to await the result of the suit and is excused from performance of his contract until the garnishment proceeding is determined Upon this question there is a conflict of authority 421MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW There is a line of cases which hold that the service of a garnishment summons creates no specific lien upon the goods of the debtor in the hands of the garnishee but simply makes the garnishee personally liable in case he disposes of the goods while the proceeding is pending McGarry v Lewis Coal Co 93 Mo 237 6 S W 8I 3 Am St Rep 522 Corning v Records 69 N H 390 46 Atl 462 76 Am St Rep 178 Maxwell v Bank of New Richmond IOI Wis 286 77 N W I49 70 Am St Rep 926 McGarry v Lewis Coal Co supra contains a quotation from DRAKE ATTACHMENT Ed 4  453 that the plaintiff does not acquire a clear and full lien upon the specific property in the garnishees possession but only such a lien as gives him the right to hold the garnishee personally liable for it or its value Then there are cases holding that the service of the garnishment sum mons will not be allowed to interfere with the contractual rights existing between the defendant in the garnishment and the garnishee Wall v Norfolk Etc R Co 52 W Va 485 44 S E 294 94 Am St Rep 948 Baldwin v Great Northern Railway Co 8I Minn 247 83 N W 986 51 L R A O S 640 The former of these two cases might better as it seems to us have been decided on the ground that cars belonging to a rail road company or other property being used in a public or quasipublic business are not the subject of garnishment rather than on the ground on which it was actually decided viz that a traffic arrangement or contract between the railroads could not be interfered with Of course the subject of garnishment is regulated largely by statute and these statutes undoubtedly had some influence on the foregoing decisions but we think that it may be said that these decisions are contrary to the weight of authority and to the majority of statutes on the subject It is often said that a garnishee is in a way an officer of the court and holds the goods of the debtor in his hands as such officer and subject to the control of the court Generally officers of the court have no right or au thority to dispose of property in their hands while the cause is pending and there is no apparent reason why an exception should be made in the case of the garnishee Many cases hold that the goods of the debtor in the possession of the garnishee are from the service of the garnishment summons in custodia legis and that the garnishee has no right to dispose of them but rather should hold them to await the determination by the court of the rights of the parties Brashear v West et al 7 Pet 608 622 Focke et al v Blum et al 82 Tex 436 17 S W 770 Beamer et al v Winter et al 41 Kan 596 21 Pac 1078

Shapleigh 24 Neb 635 39 N W 788 8 Am St Rep 224 RoOD GARNISHMENT  194 Furthermore it has been said that persens do not generally get possession of the chattels of others except by virtue of a contract between them and that if the rights of the parties under the contract are to be held to be superior 422NOTE AND COMMENT to the rights of the garnishing creditor then garnishment amounts to nothing as a remedy These courts accordingly hold that the service of the garnish ment summons relieves the garnishee from his obligation to proceed with the performance of his contract until the rights of the parties are determined by the court Landa v Holck I29 Mo 663 3I S W 900 50 Am St Rep 459 First Nat Bank of Davenport v The Davenport  St Paul R Co 45 Ia i20 Adams v Scott o14 Mass 164 Cook v Coleman I67 Mass 414 45 N E 913 57 Am St Rep 465 Other cases hold that if the garnishee does dispose of the goods in his possession belonging to the debtor then he acts at his peril and must answer for the value of the goods Lee  Anderson v Louisville  N R Co et al 2 Ga App 337 58 S E 520 Aldrich v Woodcock and Trustees Io N H 99 Dow v Taylor 71 Vt 337 45 Atl 220 76 Am St Rep 775 It seems rather inconsistent to say that the garnishee must perform his contract and then say that he must answer for the value of the goods upon the determination of the garnishment proceeding for the contract may have required that the goods be disposed of at a time when their full value could not be realized Yet it would seem that the garnishee must answer for this loss and must account to the garnishing creditor for the full value of the goods In view of the above authorities we think that the better rule and the rule supported by the weight of authority is that the service of the gar nishment summons relieves the garnishee from his obligation to proceed with the performance of his contract until the court shall determine the rights of the parties to the proceeding and that in fact it is the duty of the garnishee to hold the goods in his possession to await the determination of the court J F B THE POLICE POWER BILLBOARDS AND SKY SIGNSThe building code of the City of New York  I44 provides that any sign or advertising device supported or attached over or above any building etc shall be deemed a sky sign and prohibits such signs from being constructed more than nine feet above the front wall of any building at any part The relator sought to erect a sign on a building to a greater height than allowed by the ordi nance and applied for a writ of mandamus to compel defendant the super intendent of streets of the City of New York to consider an application for a permit Held that the ordinance constituted a taking of property with out compensation People ex rel M Wineburgh Advertising Co v Mur phy 113 N Y Supp 855 This decision is in accord with the weight of authority but that there is a good argument on the other side appears from the fact that in the lower court the justice decided in favor of the constitutionality of the ordi nance and in this court the justices are divided three to two that numer ous ordinances of like nature have been passed in other cities and that the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of California decided in favor of the constitutionality of a similar ordinance forbidding 423

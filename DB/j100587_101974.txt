Extract of a Letter from Mr Anthony Van Leuwenhoek S R S to the R Soc containing several Observations on Cinnabar and Gunpowder HAving with the greatest niceness examined native Cinnabar I could discover therein nothing worthy notingwherefore I gave it a very strong Fireupon which it soon began to move many small Particles separating themselves from the rest till they had crept into a cooler place and notwithstanding the great Weight of the Cinnabar yet several considerable Particles as big as Pins Heads rose up from the Fire and got into cooler places When the Heat was encreasd the Cinnabar began to evaporate a black Smoak arising made up of small755 small Globules Examining this Cinnabar when cold I found therein several sixsiided Figures such as is re presented No 1 A of which some were very regular other not they were of different sizes some of the bigness of a small Sand others an hundred times less some were of the Fig B shaped like an Equilateral Tri angle with the Three Points cut off I never found any of these Figures in the Cinnabar till it had been expo sed to a strong Fire which separated them from it not withstanding which it still retained its red Colour only was somewhat browner Some part of the Cinnabar that lay next to the fire appeared as C D some Particles also were like E o thers like F and some with several Points and solid Angles as G H Besides these Figures there was a blackish matter which like Smoak had been separated from the Cinnabar where I found a great number of exceeding small Globules of Qnicksilver and admired at the great quantity thereof contained in the Cinnabar Amongst these Globules lay some which I judged to be Salt Particles but for their extreme minuteness I could not discern their Figure When I burnt the Cinnabar in the open Air there arose a Flame very like that of Brimctone but upon examination I could not find that the inflammable parts thereof were true Brimstone Then I caused the Flow ers of Brimstone to arise which I viewed and found amongst several irregular parts some Globules transpa rent like Oil and the higher they rose from the Firethe smaller were these Globules till in the end they became undistinguishable The Volatile parts of Cinnabar could not be driven very high tho with a great Fire where as those of Brimstone were raised much higher with a small Heat I observed in the Brimstone several Salt Particles constituted as I guessd of many small uni ted Globules For I suppose they were raised in a round E e 2 Figure756 Figure which subsiding shoots into Angles especially if they meet with any Moisture Powdering some Cinnabar I exposed it to the Fire as before and found therein sixsided Figures with some triangular ones whereof some had one others more Angles broken off with other differing Figures with one acute Angle but there were no Squares or Oblongs I often found amongst them a considerable quantity of Oil with some  parts which I took for Salts this Oil lay farthest from the Fire and I judged the Flame which I sometimes observed might be from the burning of these Oily parts I then poured Rainwater on some of this Cinnabar that had been raised by the Fire without flaming and when it had stood in the Air till part was evapora ted I found a great number of Salt Particles of a lon gish Figure as are represented No 2 1 And tho some of these were bigger yet I judged them to be formed of the smaller ones united together Amongst the rest some were pyramidal constituted on a sixsided Basis and ending in a point like little Diamonds There were Salts of some other Figures as Oblongs c So that no estimate can be made of these Salts It is true RainWater affords a Salt but it is in so small a quantity as not to be considered in this Experiment Then I poured Rainwater on beaten Cinnabar and after some Weeks setling and in part evaporated I found therein an inconceivable number of Salt Particles of which I could not discern the Figures they were so small my best Microscope shewing them no bigger than a Sand appears to the Naked Eye only I fancied some were Sexangular Boiling some of this Water and evaporating part of it the aforementioned Salts were to be seen in greater quantity some of the lar est are represented magnified No 2 K L L Having757 Having therefore thought that the Salt Particles which were raised up by the force of the Fire must necessarily be of a Spherical Figure as being softned and melted by the Heat I was willing to be satisfyd herein and remembring some Remarks I had formerly made on Gunpowder I took several clean Glass Vials from 3 to 6 Inches long these I heated to dry them and ra risy the Air and then put therein one or more of the largest Corns of Gunpowder and closed them up to ex clude the common Air and placed them in so great a Heat that the Powder took Fire filling the Glass with a white Smoak some of the Cole and Brimstone stick ing to the sides but putting in more Corns they were carried up much higher so that I could very di stinctly discern the Brimstone from the Nitre for it lay so thick in some places as to exhibit a yellow co lour and might by a good Microscope be seen moving circularly in the white Smoak which was the Nitre tho the Particles thereof were very small which when moving appeared perfect Spheres which leisurely sub sided to the bottom of the Glass Wherefore I laid the Glass along that the Particles of the Nitre might be di stinct from those of the Coal and Brimstone and then I found those Particles which before seemed Globular were when fixed on the sides of the Glass all shot in to sixsided Salts Some were like No 3 M N with others irregular as 0 and some of these ended pyra midally like little Diamonds Some of the Salt peter Particles which lay mixt with the others were long and slender and looked like little bundles of Arrows Besides the forementioned parts I observed a Moi sture in the upper part of the Glass upon the first fi ring of the Powder which I guessd might come from the Nitre and therefore shall call it Oyl of Nitre tho possibly there might be some Oyl of Sulphur mixt therewith for further Satisfaction I put some refined Nitre758 Nitre by it self in a Glass leaving a small hole in the top to prevent its bursting and gave it so great a heat that the Nitre boyled and found in the upper part of the Glass a very transparent fluid matter or Oyl which at another time was curdled together in irregular Fi gures and stuck to the Glass Not fully satisfied herewith I repeated the Experi ments with the powder and immediately after its blow ing up I viewed the Glass with a Microscope and could then discern the very suddain change or shooting of the Globular Particles of the Nitre into Sexangular Salts and that all at once The number of these Salt Peter Particles afforded by one Corn of Powder is in conceivably great besides those of the Sulphur and Coal These were best seen when I fired but one Corn for when there were more fired the greater quantity of Nitre blew up so much of the Sulphur and Coal that the change and shooting of the Salts could not be so well seen If I fired the Powder with Heat from below the Coal and Sulphur would be blown up but if with Heat from above but few Particles of the Coal and yet fewer of the Sulphur would be forced up Next I fired onetwoand three Corns of Powder in se veral closed Glasses and suffering them to cool I opened them some after 4 or 5 days and found always com prest Air therein which flew forcibly out That I might know the quantity of this generated Air I open ed some of them after such a manner that the Air con tained therein issued into a Bolthead with a narrow Neck which was filled with Water which as the Air rushed in was forced out by which Experiment I found the Air compressd eight times what it was before or which is the same thing when at liberty took up eight times the room it did before Not759 Not fully satisfied herewith I put one Corn of Pow der in a Glass and closing it up with a very small hole only at the narrow end which end I placed under the Water in the glass Vessel as before and firing the Pow der so great a quantity of Air was thereby generated as forced out 160 Grains of Water Now 13 Corns of Powder weigh but one Grain wherefore multiply ing 160 by 13 which 2080 we find that Gun powder fired expands it self 2080 times or takes up so many times the Space it did before I observed likewide that the Glass wherein the Pow der was fired would be always filled half full of Water immediately after the Explosion the reason of which I conceived to be the great rarefaction of the Air by the Heat of the Fire and stroke of the Powderwhich up on cooling takes up less Space and the Water enters in to fill up the rest to prevent a Vacuity From this last Observation I concluded that a Bullet cannot be shot with so great a Force out of a very long Canon or other Gun as out of one something short er And discoursing since with a certain Commander upon this Subject he told me he was once present when upon a Wager a Cannon of 14 Foot threw a Ball much farther than one of 18 Foot As to the Reason how so great a quantity of Air comes to be generated tho I thought of several Solu tions yet I could not satisfie my self I sometimes thought that the Particles of the Air were by the violent motion broken and comminuted into smaller and so be tween each Particle a much finer Substance might be placed but this did not answer so great an Expansion Upon the whole I concluded that the greatest Improve ment that can be made in shooting is if possible so to order the matter that all or the greatest part of the Powder be fired at once and when this is effected a much less quantity will serve than is now used To760 To examine yet farther this matter of newmade Air I took one Grain weight of Crabs Eyes to which I poured Wine Vinegar and in 4 hours as much Air was generated as filled the space of 44 Grains of Water and 3 Grains of CrabsEyes produced about three times as much This newmade Air kept its Expansion for 12 hours that I observed it whence it appears to have been true Air

ROMULUS AS WE LEARN FROM  OF   FOR NUMA AS HE  SAIS FIRST DIVIDED THE WHOLE COUNTRY INTO SUCH  PORTIONS AS THEY CALL  OVER EACH OF WHICH  HE APPOINTED AN OFFICER WHOM HE CALLS    AND  THAT IS A PRESIDENT OR  MASTER INSPECTOR AND SURVEYOR HIS BUSINESS WAS  TO SURVEY THE LANDS AND TAKE AN ACCOUNT IN WRI  TING WHETHER THEY WERE WELL OR ILL CULTIVATED  WHICH ACCOUNTS HE LAID BEFORE THE KING WHO  COMMENDED THOSE HUSBANDMEN WHO HAD BEEN  DILIGENT AND TREATED THEM COURTEOUSLY BUT RE  PROVED AND FINED THE INDOLENT IN ORDER TO EXCITE  THEM TO GREATER DILIGENCE Z THE ROMAN TERRITORIES AT THAT TIME WERE CONFINED WITHIN VERY NARROW BOUNDS BUT IN AFTER AGES AS THEY INLARGED THEIR DOMINIONS BY CONQUESTS MANY OF THE COUNTRIES WHICH THEY SUBDUED WERE GIVEN TO THE SOLDIERS AS A REWARD FOR THEIR SERVICE AND AS A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF LAND WAS ALLOTED TO EACH SOLDIER THE DISTRIBUTION WAS MADE BY PERSONS SENT WITH THEM FOR THAT PURPOSE AND THOSE SETTLEMENTSOR COLO X GEORG LIB II 382 Y IN VOC

AFTERWARDS ABOUT THE LIMITS OF THEIR POSSESSIONS THE MAGISTRI PAGORUM WERE IMPOWERED TO ADJUST THEM AND PREVENT ALL INCORACHMENTS OF THAT SORT FOR WHICH END ALSO PUBLIC PROCESSIONS WERE MADE AT CERTAIN TIMES ACCOMPANIED WITH SACRIFICES AND OTHER RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES A IN HONOUR OF THE TUTE LAR DEITY OF THE PLACE THE EXPENSE OF WHICH WAS BORN BY CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE INHABITANTS AS WAS SHEWN IN A FORMER PAPER WHICH I HAD THE HONOUR TO LAY BEFORE THIS SOCIETY B THESE OFFICERS HAD LIKEWISE THE CARE OF THE ROADS WHICH LED FROM ONE TOWN OR VILLAGE TO ANOTHER WITHIN THEIR RESPE CTIVE JURISDICTIONS TO KEEP THEM IN GOOD REPAIR  AND ANOTHER PART OF THEIR DUTY WAS TO PROVIDE AC COMMODATIONS FOR THE ARMIES IN THEIR MARCH AS ALSO FOR THE GOVERNORS OF PROVINCES AND OTHER GREAT PER SONS

THAT SOME REASON SHOULD BE ALLEGED FOR ASSIGNING IT TO THE MAGISTER PAGI IN THIS INSCRI PTION WHERE NO OTHER WORD IS ADDED TO DETERMINE THE PARTICULAR SENSE OF IT AND INDEED I CANNOT PRETEND TO OFFER ANY DIRECT PROOF FOR THIS BUT THE REASONS WHICH INDUCE ME TO THINK SO ARE THESE WHICH FOLLOW BOTH THE DESIGN AND FORM OF THE INSCRIPTION SEEM TO SUIT HIM BEST FOR THE  OF IT BEING THE PERFORMANCE OF A VOW TO THE GODESS FLORA VERY PROBABLY FOR A PROSPEROUS AND FRUITFUL SEASON AS THE EFFECT OF THEIR ADDRESSES TO HER BY WHOM COULD THAT SO PROPERLY BE DONE AS BY THIS OFFICER WHO PRESIDED OVER THE RELIGIOUS AS WELL AS CIVIL AFFAIRS OF THE INHABITANTS BESIDES I CANNOT BUT THINK FROM THE NAME DROSUS WHICH ELSEWHERE IS ALWAYS SPELT DRUSUS THAT THIS INSCRIPTION WAS WRI TEN BEFORE SEVERAL OTHER OFFICERS WERE APPOINTED WHO AFTERWARDS BORE THE TITLE OF MAGISTER WHICH MIGHT RENDER ANY EXPLANATORY WORD UNNECESSARY AT THAT TIME ESPECIALLY IN THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD HIS RESIDENCE THERE ARE INDEED

IN THE SAME MANNER AS WE MEET WITH MAGISTER COLLEGII VICI AND THE LIKE BUT THE FORMER OF THESE WAS AS LATE AS THE REIGN OF TIBERIUS AND THE TIME OF THE LATTER UNCERTAIN SO THAT NOTHING CAN BE CON CLUDED FROM IT AND THERE ARE LIKEWISE SEVERAL INSCRIPTIONS IN WHICH MAGISTER AND MAGISTRI STAND ALONE WITHOUT THE ADDITION OF ANY EXPLANA TORY WORD BUT THEN IT APPEARS EITHER FROM THE DESIGN OF THOSE INSCRIPTIONS THE NUMBER OF PER SONS MENTIONED OR SOME OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE RELA TING TO THEM THAT THEIR OFFICE WAS OF A DIFFERENT NATURE SOME FEW INSTANCES OF WHICH I SHALL PRE SENTLY HAVE OCCASION TO MENTION FROM THESE CON SIDERATIONS THEREFORE I HAVE BEEN LED TO CONCLUDE THAT THE SENSE HERE ASSIGNED TO THE WORD MAGISTER AS IT RESPECTS THIS INSCRIPTION IS THE MOST PROBABLE THAT THE CHARACTERS II STAND FOR ANNI SECUNDI THE DATE OF THE TIME DURING WHICH THIS DROSUS HAD THEN HELD THAT OFFICE IS CONFIRMED BY SEVERAL INSCRIPTIONS PUBLISHED BY GRUTER IN ONE OF WHICH WE HAVE M A G A N N I V I IN ANOTHER M A G I S T R I A N N I V I K AND IN TWO OTHERS M A G A N N I P R I M I L WHERE THE WORD DENOTING THE TIME IS EXPRESSED AT LENGTH AS THESE DIFFERENT WAYS THEREFORE OF EXPRESSING THE TIME RELATE TO PERSONS WHO ALL BORE THAT TITLE THO NOT THE SAME OFFICE I PAG LIV NUM 1 K PAG XXXVI NUM 7 L PAG XXXIII NUM 10 XXXV 5303 AS APPEARS BY THE INSCRIPTIONS THEY PLAINLY SHEW IN WHAT SENSE THOSE CHARACTERS ARE TO BE TAKEN HERE THE CONCLUDING LETTERS V S L M WHICH STAND FOR VOTUM SOLVIT LIBENS MERITO CONTAIN THE USUAL FORM OF DEDICATING VOTIVE MONUMENTS BUT THE THING DEDICATED IS NOT MENTIONED HERE WHICH WAS MOST PROBABLY A STATUE OR AN ALTAR AND I RATHER THINK THE LATTER FROM THE NUMBER OF SUCH INSCRIPTIONS IN GRUTER AND OTHER COLLECTORS OF AN TIENT MONUMENTS TAKEN FROM ALTARS WHEREAS WE HEAR OF FEW IMAGES OF ANY SORT RELATING TO THIS DEITY PLINY INDEED MENTIONS A STATUE OF FLORA AT ROME WHICH WAS MADE BY PRAXITELES M AND MONTFAUCON HAS GIVEN THE DRAUGHTS OF THREE OR FOUR OTHERS WHICH HAVE BEEN THOUGHT TO REPRESENT THAT GODESS N HER HEAD ALSO IS FOUND UPON TWO COINS ONE OF THE CLAU DIAN O AND THE OTHER OF THE SERVILIAN FAMILY P HOW EVER THESE ARE BUT VERY FEW COMPARATIVELY WITH WHAT WE MEET WITH OF OTHER DEITIES BESIDES THE AGE OF THIS INSCRIPTION WHICH SEEMS FURTHER CON FIRMED BY ITS BREVITY AND SIMPLICITY AS LIKEWISE THE PLACE WHERE IT WAS DISCOVERED SUIT MUCH BETTER WITH AN ALTAR FOR ALTARS WERE ERECTED IN ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND VERY EARLY I SUPPOSE THERE FORE THAT THIS PLATE WAS FIXED INTO THE FRONT OF SOME ALTAR CONSECRATED TO FLORA FOR WHICH PURPOSE BOTH M

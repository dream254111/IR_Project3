Water,i206960,155 VII An Account of some analytical Experments on a mineral Production from Devonshire consisting principally of Alumine and Water By Humphry Davy Esq F R S Professor of Chemistry in the Royal Institution Read February 28 1805 1 Preliminary Observations TEHIS fossil was found many years ago by Dr WAVEL in a quarry near Barnstaple Mr HATCHETT Who visited the place in 1796 described it as filling some of the cavities and veins in a rock of soft argillaceous shist When first made known it was considered as a zeolite Mr HATCHETT however con cluded from its geological position that it most probably did not belong to that class of stones and Dr BABINGTON from its physical characters and from some experiments on its solution in acids made at his request by Mr STOCKLER ascer tained that it was a mineral body as yet not described and that it contained a considerable proportion of aluminous earth It is to Dr BABINGTON that I am obliged for the opportu nity of making a general investigation of its chemical nature and that gentleman liberally supplied mne with specimens for analysis X 2156 Mr Davys Account of some analytical Experiments II Sensible Characters of the Fossil The most common appearance of the fossil is in small hemispherical groups of crystals composed of a number of filaments radiating from a common centre and inserted on the surface of the shist but in some instances it exists as a collection of irregularly disposed prisms forming small veins in the stone as yet I believe no insulated or distinct crystal has been found Its colour is white in a few cases with a tinge of gray or of green and in some pieces apparently beginning to decompose of yellow Its lustre is silky some of the specimens possess semitransparency but in general it is nearly opaque Its texture is loose but its small fragments possess great hardness so as to scratch agate It produces no effect on the smell when breathed upon has no taste does not become electrical or phosphorescent byheat or friction and does not adhere to the tongue till after it has been strongly ignited It does not decrepitate before the flame of the blowpipe but it loses its hardness and becomes quite opaque In consequence of the minuteness of the portions in which it is found few of them exceeding the size of a pea it is very difficult to ascertain its specific gravity with any pre cision but from several trials I am disposed to believe that it does not exceed 270 that of water being considered as 100 III Chemical Characters of the Fossil The perfectly white and semitransparent specimens of the fossil are soluble both in the mineral acids and in fixed alka line lixivia by heat without sensibly effervescing and withouton a mineral Production from Devonshire al leaving any notable residuum but a small part remains un dissolved when coloured or opaque specimens are exposed to the alkaline lixivia A small semitransparent piece acted on by the highest heat of an excellent forge had its crystalline texture destroy ed and was rendered opaque but it did not enter into fusion After the experiment it adhered strongly to the tongue and was found to have lost more than a fourth of its weight Water and alcohol whether hot or cold had no effect on the fossil When it was acted on by a heat of from 212 to 6oo0 FAHREN HEIT in a glass tube it gave out an elastic vapour which when condensed appeared as a clear fluid possessing a slight em pyreumatic smell but no taste different from that of pure water The solution of the fossil in sulphuric acid when evaporated sufficiently deposited crystals which appeared in thin plates and had all the properties of sulphate of alumine and the solid matter when redissolved and mixed with a little carbo nate of potash slowly deposited octahedral crystals of alum The solid matter precipitated from the solution of the white and semitransparent fossil in muriatic acid was in no manner acted upon by solution of carbonate of ammonia and therefore it could not contain any glucine or ittria and its perfect solubility without residuum in alkaline lixivia shewed that it was alumine When the opaque varieties of the fossil were fully ex posed to the agency of alkaline lixivia the residuumn never amounted to more than onetwentieth part of the weight of the whole In the white opaque variety it was merely calca reous earth for when dissolved in muriatic acid not in excess158 Mr Davys Account of some analytical Experiments it gave a white precipitate when mixed with solutionwof oxalate of ammonia and did not affect solution of prussiate of potash and iron In the green opaque variety calcareous earth was indicated by solution of oxalate of ammonia and it containedboxide of manganese 5for it was not precipitated by solution of ammo nia but was rendered turbid and of a gray colour by solution of prussiate of potash and iron The residuum of the alkaline solution of the yellow variety when dissolved in muriatic acid produced a small quantity of white solid matter when mixed with the solution of the oxalate of ammonia and gave a light yellow precipitate by exposure to ammonia but after this when neutralized it did not affect prussiate of potash and iron so that its colouring matter as there is every reason to believe was oxide of iron IV Analysis of the Fossil Eighty grains of the fossil consisting of the whitest and most transparent parts that could be obtained were introduced into a small glass tube having a bulb of sufficient capacity to receive them with great ease rfo the end of this tube a small glass globe attached to another tube communicating with a pneuma tic mercurial apparatus was joined by fusion by means of the blowpipe The bulb of the tube was exposed to the heat of an ARGAND lamp and the globe was preserved cool by being placed in a vessel of cold water In consequence of this arrangement the fluid disengaged by the heat became condensed and no elastic matter could be lost The process was continued for half an hour when the glass tube was quite redon a mineral Productionfrom zDevonshire 59 A very minute portion only of permanently elastic fluid passed into the pneumatic apparatus andwhen examined it proved to be common air The quantity ofclear fluid collected when poured into another vessel weighed i 9 grains but when the interior of the apparatus had been carefully wiped and dried the whole loss indicated was 21 grains The 1g grains of fluid had a faint smell similar to that of burning peat it was trans parent and tasted like distilled water but it slightly reddened litmus paper It produced no cloudiness in solutions of muriate of barytes of acetite of lead of nitrate of silver or of sulphate of iron The 59 grains of solid matter were dissolved in diluted sul phuric acid which left no residuum and the solution was mixed with potash in sufficient quatity to cause the alumine at first precipitated again to dissolve What remained undissolved by potash after being collected and properly washed was heated strongly and weighed  its quantity was a grain and quarter It was white caustic to the taste and had all the properties of lime The solution was mixed with nitric acid till it became sour Solution of carbonate of ammonia was then poured into it till the effect of decomposition ceased The whole thrown into a filtrating apparatus left solid matter which when carefully washed and dried at the heat of ignition weighed 56 grains They were pure alumine hence the general results of the experiments when calculated upon indicated for too parts of this specimen Of alumine    70 Of lime    14 Of fluid     26 LoSS    24i6o Mr Davys Account of some analytical Experiments The loss I am inclined to attribute to some fluid remaining in the stone after the process of distillation for I have found from several experiments that a red heat is not sufficient to expel all the matter capgble of being volatiliized and that the full effect can only be produced by a strong white heat Fifty grains of a very transparent part of the fossil by being exposed in a red heat for fifteen minutes lost 13 grains but when they were heated to whiteness the deficiency amounted to 15 grains and the case was similar in other trials Different specimens of the fossil were examined with great care for the purpose of ascertaining whether any minute por tion of fixed alkali existed in them but no indications of this substance could be observed the processes were conducted by means of solution of the unaltered fossil in nitric acid  the earths and oxides were precipitated from the solution by being boiled with carbonate of ammonia and after their separation the fluid was evaporated to dryness and the nitrate of ammonia decomposed by heat when no residuum occurred A comparative analysis of 3o grains of a very pellucid speci men was made by solution in lixivium of potash This specimen lost 8 grains by long continued ignition after which it easily dissolved in the lixivium by heat leaving a residuum of a quarter of a grain only which was red oxide of iron The pre cipitate from the solution of potash m ade by means of muriate of ammonia weighed when properly treated 21 grains Several specimens were distilled in the manner above de scribed and in all cases the water collected had similar proper ties The only test by which the presence of acid matter in it could be detected was litmus paper and in some cases the effect upon this substance was barely perceptibleon a mineral Production found in Devonshire i6i V General Observations I lave made several experiments with the hope of ascer tainihg the nature of the acid matter in the water but from the impossibility of procuring any considerable quantity of the fossil they have been wholly unsuccessful It is however evident from the experiments already detailed that it is not one of the known mineral acids I am disposed to believe from the minuteness of its propor tion and from the difference of this proportion mi different cases that it is not essential to the composition of the stone and that as well as the oxide of manganese that of iron and the lime it is only an accidental ingredient and on this idea the pure matter of the fossil must be considered as a chemical combinaa tion of about thirty parts of water and seventy of alunzine The experiments of M THEODORE DE SAUSSURE on the pre cipitation of alumine from its solutions have demonstrated the affinity of this body for water but as yet I believe no aluini nous stone except that which I have just described has been found containing so large a proportion of water as thirty parts in the hundred The diaspore which has been examined by M VAUQUELIN and which loses sixteen or seventeen parts in the hundred by ignition and which contains nearly eighty of alumine and only three of oxide of iron is supposed by that excellent chemist to be a compound of alumine and water Its physical and chemical characters differ however very much from those of the new fossil and other researches are wanting to ascertain whether the part of it volatilized by heat is of the same kind  Journal de Physique Tom LII p 280 MDCCCV y162 Mr Davys Account of some analytical Experiments c I have examined a fossil from near St Austle in Cornwall very similar to the fossil from Barnstaple in all its general chemical characters and I have been informed that an analysis of it made by the Rev WILLIAM GREGOR some months since proves that it consists of similar ingredients Dr BABINGTON has proposed to call the fossil from Devon shire Wavellite from DrWAVEL the gentleman who discovered it but if a name founded upon its chemical composition be pre ferred it may be denominated Hydrargillite from up water and  ixog clay

J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1010661,BUSINESS AND SCIENCE,I242575,BUSINESS AND SCIENCE BY JAMES T YOUNG DIRECTOR WHARTON SCHOOL OF FINANCE AND COMMERCE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA THE EAGERNESS WITH WHICH AMERICAN BUSINESS MEN HASTEN TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THE NEWEST SCIENTIFIC INVENTIONS AND DISCOVERIES HAS PRODUCED TWO INTERESTING RESULTS FIRST THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN EXTENSIVE SYSTEM OF BYPRODUCT INDUSTRIES SECOND THE CREATION OF A SHARPER DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE UPPER AND LOWER GRADES OF EM PLOYMENT BOTH OF THESE CHANGES HAVE AFFECTED THE FIELD OF UNI VERSITY EDUCATION THE PERFECTION OF INDUSTRIAL CHEMISTRY HAS BROUGHT WITH IT THE BYPRODUCT AND THE BYPRODUCT HAS REVOLUTION IZED MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY THIS IS THE AGE OF ALLIED AND  AUXILIARY  BUSINESSES IN BOTH INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE THE GROWTH OF BYPRODUCTS HAS CAUSED A DEMAND FOR TWO DIFFERENT CLASSES OF MEN TECHNICAL EXPERTS OR SPECIALISTS AND EXECUTIVE AND COMMERCIAL MAN AGERS OR  DEVELOPERS THE POPULAR BELIEF IS THAT THIS IS THE ERA OF SPECIALIZATION BUT THE FIELD OF THE NARROW BUSINESS SPECIALIST IS AT PRESENT NEITHER VERY PROFITABLE NOR EXTENSIVE THE TECHNICAL EXPERT WHO IS EMPLOYED TO SOLVE A LIMITED CLASS OF PROBLEMS IS NOT THE MAN WHO DETERMINES POLICIES OR GUIDES ENTERPRISES HE MAY OR MAY NOT BE WELL PAID BUT HE DOES NOT FURNISH THE HIGHEST NOR THE MOST AP PRECIATED SERVICE TO THE UNDERTAKING THE INDISPENSABLE MAN IS HE WHO CAN USE THE SERVICES OF THE SPECIALIST TO DEVELOP NEW FIELDS AND OPEN NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE BUSINESS THE COMMON FALLACY IS TO SUPPOSE THAT EACH CORPORATION MAKES A SPECIALTY OF ONE BUSINESS THAT THE MORE NARROWLY AND CLOSELY EACH SPECIALIZES THE BETTER AND MORE SALABLE ITS PRODUCT AND THE MORE INTENTLY EACH INDIVIDUAL OFFICER LIMITS AND CONCENTRATES HIS EFFORTS WITHIN A GIVEN SCOPE THE GREATER HIS SUCCESS AND HIS VALUE TO THE CORPORATION  LET THE SHOEMAKER STICK TO HIS LAST IS THE GENERALLY ACCEPTED VIEW IT CORRESPONDS TO A THEORETICAL WORLD IN 28BUSINESS AND SCIENCE WHICH EACH STEP FORWARD IN ECONOMIC PROGRESS IS ACHIEVED BY THE FORMATION OF SOME NEW CONCERN WHICH CONCENTRATES ITS HUGE WEALTH UPON THE PRODUCTION OF A SINGLE ARTICLE A SYSTEM OF EDUCATION BUILT UPON THIS THEORETICAL WORLD AS A BASIS WOULD BE SUBJECT TO PRACTICAL EARTHQUAKES FOR THE MEATPACKERS SELL SOAP THE GAS COMPANY MAKES ROOFING PITCH THE ASPHALT BUSINESS INCLUDES THE MANAGEMENT OF A WINTER HOTEL AND THE OIL INTERESTS SELL BANK CREDITS THE SUCCESS OF THE DEPARTMENT STORE IS A STANDING PROTEST AGAINST THE THEORY OF SPECIALIZATION EACH STORE SUPPLANTS NUMEROUS SPECIAL SHOPS ITS VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS DO NOT SUCCEED BY DEVOTING THEIR ATTENTION TO INDIVIDUAL WARES BUT BY DEVELOPING OR SUGGESTING MANY NEW WANTS THE JEWELRY DEPARTMENT PROFITS FROM ITS RESIDENCE UNDER THE SAME ROOF WITH THE BOOKSTORE AND THE SALE OF NOTIONS IS REIN FORCED BY THE CAFE WHY SHOULD A FIRM SPEND LARGE SUMS IN AD VERTISING TO ATTRACT CUSTOMERS TO ITS ESTABLISHMENT BUT COMPEL THEM TO LEAVE THE BUILDING FOR LUNCHEON WHY SHOULD A SHOPPER LEAVE THE BUILDING AT ALL HENCE THE RESTAURANT THE CONCERT THE LECTURE ON SOME INTERESTING TOPIC THE EXHIBITION OF PAINTINGS AND WAR RELICS THE SLEIGHT OF HAND ENTERTAINMENT AND EVEN THE MINIA TURE CIRCUS PERFORMANCE IN THE DEPARTMENT STORE A SPECIALIZED SHOP CANNOT COMPETE BECAUSE IT IS FOUNDED ON A PRINCIPLE WHICH IS NO LONGER APPLICABLE THE PRODUCTION OF OIL HAS LED TO AN ESPECIALLY INTERESTING SERIES OF AUXILIARY ENTERPRISES CRUDE AND REFINED OIL PETROLEUM JELLY GAS GASOLINE AND LIGHT OILS FINE AND HEAVY LUBRICATING OILS WAX PARAFFINE CHEWING GUM OIL CAKE BARRELS TIN CANS BAGS AND WOODEN BOXES ARE ALL MANUFACTURED IN THE VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS AND PLANTS OF THE INDUSTRY IN ADDITION IT HAS PROVED PROFITABLE TO OWN AND OPERATE BANKS STEAMSHIP LINES AND VARIOUS OTHER COMMERCIAL UNDER TAKINGS THE ASPHALT INTERESTS OWN OR OPERATE ASPHALT BEDS PAVING COMPANIES VITRIFIED BRICK PLANTS PAVINGTOOL AND IMPLEMENT FAC TORIES MINES TROLLEYS TELEPHONES AND RESORT HOTELS IN GAS MANUFACTURE TAR BRIQUETTES LIGHT AND HEAVY OILS DYES CREOSOTE AND COKE ARE RESULTANT BYPRODUCTS LEADING TO THE DEVELOP MENT OF NEW MARKETS AND NEW DEPARTMENTS OF THE BUSINESS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL MEATPACKING CONCERNS HAVE BEEN DIRECTED BY MEN WHO WERE ABLE TO DEVELOP EXTENSIVE ALLIED  INDUSTRIES BESIDES THE USUAL DRESSED FRESH CANNED DRIED AND SMOKED MEATS THE PACK ING INTERESTS MANUFACTURE SOUPS MEAT EXTRACTS SAUSAGES LARD TOILET 29THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY LAUNDRY AND WOOLSOAP GELATINE PEPSIN GLUE FERTILIZER ETC AND OPERATE PRINTING ESTABLISHMENTS CAN BOX AND PAINT FACTORIES EX TENSIVE REFRIGERATOR CAR LINES AND MEAT FRUIT AND VEGETABLE REFRIG ERATING PLANTS IN ADDITION TO THE MANUFACTURING SIDE OF THE BUSI NESS A WHOLESALE ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN BUILT UP WHICH DISTRIBUTES SOME OF THE PRODUCTS THROUGHOUT PRACTICALLY THE ENTIRE DOMESTIC MARKET ANOTHER INSTANCE OF THEFAULTINESS OF THE IMPRESSION THAT BUSI NESS SUCCESS IS WON PRIMARILY BY SPECIALIZATION MAY BE SEEN IN THE FIELD OF RAILWAY MANAGEMENT THE RAILWAY IS COMMONLY SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOST HIGHLY SPECIALIZED UNDERTAKING IN THE UNITED STATES YET IT IS ONE WHICH REQUIRES A GREAT BREADTH OF VIEW AND THE HIGHEST ABILITY TO DEVELOP WIDELY VARYING RESOURCES MANY RAILWAY COM PANIES DEVOTE THE MOST CAREFUL ATTENTION TO THE SETTLEMENT OF NEW BUSINESS ENTERPRISES ALONG THEIR LINES OF TRAFFIC THEY COLLECT AND DIS TRIBUTE INFORMATION CONCERNING THE COST OF LAND TAXATION LABOR MARKETS FREIGHT RATES ETC AS AN EXAMPLE LET US TAKE THE EFFORTS OF SUCH A LINE AS THE ERIE TO DEVELOP NEW BUSINESS IN THE WONDER FULLY FERTILE INDUSTRIAL FIELD BETWEEN NEW YORK AND CHICAGO THIS DISTRICT COMPRISES PARTS OF THE STATES OF NEW YORK NEW JERSEY PENNSYLVANIA OHIO INDIANA AND ILLINOIS THE RAILWAY MUST CON VINCE MANUFACTURERS OF THE UNUSUAL ADVANTAGES PRESENTED BY THIS TERRITORY AS A LOCATION FOR PLANTS TO DO THIS THE COMPANY THROUGH ITS INDUSTRIAL DEPARTMENT HAS ALL THE TERRITORY WHICH IS TRAVERSED BY ITS LINES DISTRICTED IN RELATION TO RESOURCES MARKETS HARD AND SOFT COAL GAS FUEL AND OTHER ADVANTAGES FOR MANUFACTURING ETC IT ADVISES THE MANUFACTURERS AS TO SUITABLE LOCATIONS AND FURNISHES FULL INFORMATION CONCERNING LOCAL CONDITIONS THESE FAMILIAR INSTANCES SHOW THAT WHILE SPECIALIZATION IS NECES SARY TO DEVELOP THE CHEMICAL ENGINEERING OR TECHNICAL SIDE OF INDUS TRY AND COMMERCE AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT KIND OF EFFORT IS REQUIRED ON THE COMMERCIAL AND EXECUTIVE SIDES MANY A BUSINESS WHICH IS POPULARLY THOUGHT TO REST UPON THE BASIS OF SPECIALIZATION IS ON THE CONTRARY BEING DEVELOPED AS A SERIES OF INTERDEPENDENT AND ALLIED INDUSTRIES IT IS AMID THESE NEW CONDITIONS THAT THE MAN OF BROADER VIEW POINT AND SUPERIOR MENTAL TRAINING FINDS HIS MOST FAVORABLE OPPOR TUNITY THE EXPANSION OF THE HORIZON CREATES A DEMAND FOR NEW TYPES OF MEN THOSE WHO ARE NOT PREPARED FOR THE CHANGED CONDIBUSINESS AND SCIENCE TIONS ARE BY NO MEANS USELESS BUT THEY ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE EXECUTIVE AND CREATIVE WORK OF THE LARGER FIELD IN THE EXECUTIVE AND COMMERCIAL DEPARTMENTS OF EACH INDIVIDUAL UNDERTAKING THE DEGREE TO WHICH NARROW SPECIALIZATION IS NECESSARY FREQUENTLY GROWS LESS AS WE MOUNT IN THE ORDER OF OFFICIAL RANK THE MECHANICAL DAYWORKER HAS ONLY THE MOST LIMITED FIELD OF ACTIVITY THE BOOK KEEPER SALESMAN AND CLERICAL HELPER ARE ONLY SLIGHTLY SUPERIOR IN BREADTH OF SCOPE BUT WITH THE SUPERINTENDENTS AND MANAGERS A DIFFERENT KIND OF ACTIVITY IS REQUIRED THE PROBLEM CONFRONTING THESE LATTER OFFICIALS IS HOW TO DEVISE ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE EXPANSION OF THE BUSINESS AND THE REDUCTION OF COSTS THE SPECIALIST IS AS INCAPABLE OF DOING THIS AS THE MAN AGER WOULD BE OF DOING THE SPECIALISTS WORK FROM THIS CHANGED CONDITION OF MODERN INDUSTRY IT FOLLOWS THAT THE YOUNG MAN WHO IS LOOKING FORWARD TO A BUSINESS CAREER SHOULD DECIDE WHETHER HE WISHES TO TAKE UP A TECHNICAL SPECIALTY OR TO ENGAGE IN THE EXECUTIVE OR COM MERCIAL SIDE OF THE ENTERPRISE IF THE FORMER THEN HIS PREPARATION SHOULD BE DIRECTED ALONG THE LINES OF HIS SPECIALTY IN CHEMISTRY ELEC TRICAL CIVIL OR MECHANICAL ENGINEERING IF HIS WORK IS OF AN EXECUTIVE OR COMMERCIAL CHARACTER HE SHOULD BE PREPARED FOR THESE IMPORTANT FIELDS WITH AS MUCH CARE AND THOROUGHNESS AS FOR THAT OF THE TECH NICAL DEPARTMENT THIS LAST THOUGHT SUGGESTS THE SECOND CHANGE WHICH IS TAKING PLACE IN ALL FORMS OF AMERICAN INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE THE GROWTH OF A SHARPER DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE UPPER AND LOWER GRADES OF EM PLOYMENT THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION SOCALLED IS USUALLY PLACED AT THE CLOSE OF THE I8TH CENTURY WHEN A SERIES OF INVENTIONS IN SPINNING AND WEAVING AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF STEAMPOWER INDUSTRY IMPELLED THE LABORER OF THE TIME EITHER UPWARD OR DOWNWARD IN THE ECONOMIC SCALE HE WAS OBLIGED TO CONQUER FOR HIMSELF THE POSITION OF AN INDEPENDENT EMPLOYER OR TO FALL INTO THE LARGE AND GROWING CLASS OF DEPENDENT EMPLOYEES THESE INVENTIONS ULTIMATELY GAVE RISE TO A SEPARATE LABOR CLASS AND DEVELOPED THE LABOR PROBLEM AS WE KNOW IT BUT IN REALITY THIS WAS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF A SERIES OF REVOLUTIONS WHICH HAVE TAKEN PLACE WITH EACH NEW GROUP OF IN VENTIONS IN INDIVIDUAL INDUSTRIES AND ESTABLISHMENTS AND HAVE NOT ONLY WIDENED THE GAP BETWEEN EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE BUT HAVE CREATED SHARP LINES OF DISTINCTION BETWEEN DIFFERENT GRADES OF THE EMPLOYED CLASS THE CHIEF OF THESE DISTINCTIONS IS THAT BETWEEN 3ITHE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY ADMINISTRATIVE OR EXECUTIVE POSITIONS AND OTHER KINDS OF EMPLOY MENT SUCH A DIFFERENCE IS RECOGNIZED IN COUNTLESS WAYSIN RE MUNERATION SOCIAL STANDING PERSONAL VIEWS HOSTILITY OF ORGANIZED LABOR ETC THE ENTIRE ATTITUDE OF MIND AND POINT OF VIEW OF THE BUSINESS EXECUTIVE ARE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF OTHER EMPLOYEES HE MUST HAVE AN OUTLOOK OVER AN ENTIRE DEPARTMENT OF THE BUSINESS THOSE WHO THROUGH SPECIAL ABILITY AND OPPORTUNITY SECURE A FOOTHOLD IN THE UPPER GRADES OF EMPLOYMENT ARE ENABLED TO ADVANEE TO THE HIGHER AND EVEN THE HIGHEST EXECUTIVE POSITIONS WHILST THOSE WHO FAIL TO OBTAIN THIS INITIAL ADVANTAGE ONLY SPAN THE GULF WHICH SEP ARATES THEM FROM THE OTHERS BY SOME UNUSUAL COMBINATION OF EFFORT AND CIRCUMSTANCE FURTHERMORE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO GRADES OF EM PLOYMENT IS INTENSIFIED BY THE ALREADY DESCRIBED SPECIALIZATION IN THE LOWEST ROUNDS OF BUSINESS SERVICE SUCH SPECIALIZATION NOT ONLY PREVENTS EMPLOYEES FROM LEARNING ALL SIDES OF AN UNDERTAKING BUT TOO FREQUENTLY UNFITS THEM FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF A WHOLE DEPART MENT OR ENTERPRISE BY CONFINING AND LIMITING THEIR SPHERE OF ACTION DURING THE PERIOD OF LIFE WHEN A BROADER HABIT OF MIND CAN BE FORMED THE YOUNG MAN WHO NOW ENTERS INDUSTRIAL LIFE WITH EVEN EX CEPTIONAL ABILITY THEREFORE OFTEN FINDS HIS DEVELOPMENT SERIOUSLY RE TARDED BY THE INERTIA OF ROUTINE IN THE LOWER POSITIONS AND BY THE GROWING TENDENCY TO MAKE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN EXECUTIVE AND OTHER WORK THE EMPLOYER CANNOT BE EXPECTED TO TURN HIS ESTABLISHMENT INTO AN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION FOR TEACHING THE BROAD AND FUNDA MENTAL PRINCIPLES OF HIS BUSINESS YET THESE PRINCIPLES MUST BE LEARNED BY THE MEN WHO ARE TO BE THE FUTURE MANAGERS AND DIRECTING HEADS OF THE VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS IN THE CONCERN BANKING DOES NOT CONSIST OF THE OPERATION OF AN ADDING MACHINE OR THE RUNNING OF A LEDGER MERCHANDISING IS NOT THE KEEPING OF A STOCK LIST RAILWAY MANAGEMENT IS NOT THE CARRYING OF A SURVEYORS ROD NOR DOES MANU FACTURING CONSIST SOLELY OF MECHANICAL DRAWING YET SUCH IS THE CHARACTER OF THE ROUTINE WORK WHICH YOUNG MEN ARE VERY PROPERLY REQUIRED TO PERFORM UPON ENTERING INDUSTRIAL OR COMMERCIAL LIFE IT IS FROM THESE CONDITIONS THAT THE NEED ARISES FOR SOME AGENCY WHICH WILL LIFT THE BEGINNER IN BUSINESS FROM THE POSITION OF A ROUTINE AUTOMATON TO THAT OF AN ALERT AND INTELLIGENT THOUGH SUBORDI NATE FACTOR IN THE BUSINESS ORGANIZATION AND RENDER HIM CAPABLE OF 32BUSINESS AND SCIENCE SEIZING OPPORTUNITIES FOR GREATER USEFULNESS AND PROMOTION SUCH AN AGENCY IS OFFERED BY THE UNIVERSITY THE BEGINNER WHO HAS A PROPER UNIVERSITY TRAINING MAY RUN THE ADDING MACHINE OR PERFORM THE OTHER ROUTINE DUTIES WITH NO GREATER SUCCESS AT FIRST THAN THE MAN WHO HAS NOT MADE A PRELIMINARY STUDY OF HIS FIELD BUT THE RELATION OF HIS ROUTINE DUTIES TO THE ENTIRE BUSINESS IS BETTER UNDERSTOOD BY THE FORMER AND THESE DUTIES REPRE SENT TO HIS MIND AN INTELLIGIBLE AND COHERENT PART OF A GREAT BUSINESS ENTERPRISE IN SHORT HIGHER EDUCATION FOR BUSINESS SHOULD PREVENT THE MASS OF NECESSARY ROUTINE FROM OBSCURING THE BUSINESS PRINCI PLES WHICH ARE BEING APPLIED THE MAN WHO RUNS THE ADDING MA CHINE IF HE IS TO BECOME EVENTUALLY AN ACCEPTABLE CANDIDATE FOR PRO MOTION TO HIGHER POSITIONS IN THE BANK SHOULD FAMILIARIZE HIMSELF NOT ONLY WITH THE CHECKS WHICH HE IS HANDLING BUT ALSO WITH THE CLEAR ING HOUSE SYSTEM WITH BANK DEPOSITS THE PRINCIPAL LEGISLATION AFFECT ING BANKS AND TRUST COMPANIES BANK LOANS CIRCULATION ETC EVERY BEGINNER NO MATTER HOW GREAT HIS EDUCATION MUST SERVE AN APPRENTICESHIP IN THE LOWER ROUNDS OF BUSINESS BUT THOSE WHO HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF BUSINESS PRINCIPLES BEFORE ENTERING UPON THE APPRENTICESHIP ARE APT EITHER TO GAIN A COSTLY EXPERIENCE AT THE EX PENSE OF THE UNDERTAKING OR TO BE RELEGATED PERMANENTLY TO ROUTINE WORK IN THE WORDS OF AN OFFICIAL OF ONE OF THE LARGEST RAILWAYS IN THE WEST  NO DOUBT A GREAT DEAL OF THE SHORTSIGHTED RAILWAY CON STRUCTION AND EXPENSIVE ERRORS IN MAINTENANCE AND OPERATION HAVE BEEN DUE TO THE LACK OF PROPER AND SYSTEMATIC TRAINING IN OTHER WORDS RAILWAY OFFICERS HAVE BEEN EDUCATED AT THE COST OF THE PROP ERTY HITHERTO THE APPLICATION OF SCIENCE TO BUSINESS HAS BEEN CONFINED TO THE MECHANICAL OR TECHNICAL SIDES OF MANUFACTURE AND COMMERCE MENS MINDS HAVE BEEN TURNED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY TO THE INVENTION OF MACHINES AND PROCESSES THE PERFECTION OF PLANT AND OTHER PURELY PHYSICAL FEATURES OF PRODUCTION IN THESE FIELDS OF EFFORT THE GREAT TRIUMPHS OF MODERN SCIENCE OVER MATERIAL OBSTACLES HAVE BEEN WON BUT AN EQUALLY GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE APPLICATION OF SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES EXISTS ON THE SIDE OF BUSINESS METHODS AND MANAGEMENT THE NATIONAL AND EVEN INTERNATIONAL SCOPE OF INDUSTRY TODAY RE QUIRES A FAR GREATER DEGREE OF PERFECTION AND ACCURACY IN MANAGE MENT THAN WAS FORMERLY NECESSARY OR POSSIBLE UNDER THE OLD SYSTEM THE EXISTENCE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY SUGGESTS A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION 33THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY ARE THERE INDUSTRIAL COMMERCIAL AND FINANCIAL SCIENCES  OR SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES  CAPABLE OF BEING APPLIED TO THESE BRANCHES OF HUMAN EFFORT IT WILL BE ADMITTED THAT THE RELATION OF THE UNIVERSITY TO THE BUSINESS WORLD DEPENDS UPON THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION IF SUCH BUSINESS SCIENCES DO EXIST AND ARE CAPABLE OF BEING TAUGHT IN OUR INSTITUTIONS OF LEARNING THEN THE SPHERE OF OUR GREAT UNIVERSITIES IS FAR BROADER THAN HAS HERETOFORE BEEN CONCEIVED IF SUCH SCIENCES DO NOT EXIST THE ROLE OF THE COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY IS RESTRICTED SO FAR AS BUSINESS IS CONCERNED TO A SIMPLE GENERAL COURSE THE POSSI BILITY OF TEACHING SUCH SCIENCES IS THEREFORE OF CARDINAL IMPORTANCE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CORPS OF TRAINED MEN FOR THE DIRECTION AND MANAGEMENT OF LARGE INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES WHEN THE MANUFACTURER ESTABLISHES A DEPARTMENT OF ACCOUNTS TRIES TO TRACE HIS EXACT COSTS OF PRODUCTION MAKES CONTRACTS FOR PUR CHASE OR SALE REORGANIZES A DEPARTMENT OF HIS PLANT BORROWS MONEY CONSIDERS MARKET CONDITIONS AND SEEKS FAVORABLE TRANSPORTATION RATES HE CONFRONTS A SERIES OF PROBLEMS WHICH IN SPITE OF THE PREVAILING OPINION ARE NOT EXEMPT FROM THE USUAL LAWS OF CAUSE AND EFFECT BUT ARE GOVERNED BY CERTAIN INFLUENCES AND TENDENCIES WHICH MAY BE STUDIED ARRANGED AND CLASSIFIED HIS DECISIONS ON ALL THESE POINTS ARE NOT MADE BY SOME MYSTERIOUS OR ERRATIC PROCESS OF DIVINATION BUT ARE GOVERNED BY FUNDAMENTAL RULES AND MAXIMS THE MANU FACTURER MAY EVEN OBSERVE THESE PRINCIPLES UNCONSCIOUSLY EITHER FROM HABIT OR BECAUSE HE HAS NEVER VOLUNTARILY AND FORMALLY CODIFIED THEM BUT SUCH RULES AND PRINCIPLES DO EXIST AND ARE FOLLOWED NONE THE LESS THE WORK OF EACH MANUFACTURER IN SOLVING HIS OWN PROB LEMS IS REPEATED COUNTLESS TIMES BY OTHERS WITH SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES OF TIME AND PLACE AND MAGNITUDE SOME CALCULATIONS MUST BE MADE REPEATEDLY IN ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY WHERE SUCH BUSI NESS EXISTS BUT IS THE EXPERIENCE SO GAINED WORTH NOTHING TO OTHERS IS A CORRECT DECISION ON ALL THESE POINTS THE RESULT OF A MERE WHIM OF CHANCE AND MUST EACH SUCCEEDING GENERATION BEGIN ENTIRELY ANEW THE GREAT SCIENTIFIC PROCESS OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION AND MAN AGEMENT INHERITING AND BEQUEATHING NOTHING TOWARD THE PERFECTION OF OUR ECONOMIC SYSTEM CERTAINLY THE VERY STATEMENT OF THESE QUESTIONS AFFORDS THEIR ANSWER THE BUSINESS MAN WORKS OUT AND FOLLOWS DEFINITE WELLESTABLISHED PRINCIPLES THAT THEY MAY BE EXAMINED AND ASCERTAINED IS NO LONGER A MATTER OF QUESTION THE PRINCIPLES OF TRANSPORTATION CREDIT FINANCE BUSINESS LAW ACCOUNT 34BUSINESS AND SCIENCE ING INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT INSURANCE ETC HAVE ALL BEEN ARRANGED IN SYSTEMATIC LOGICAL ORDER AND TAUGHT WITH PRECISION ANOTHER INSTANCE FROM THE FIELD OF ACCOUNTANCY THE ACCOUNT ING DEPARTMENT OF A GREAT UNDERTAKING IS THE INTELLIGENCE BUREAU OF THE INDUSTRIAL ARMY IT GIVES WHAT IS OFTEN THE ONLY RELIABLE IN FORMATION WHICH THE PROPRIETOR CAN SECURE ABOUT HIS AFFAIRS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SUCCESS AND FAILURE IS OFTEN A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GOOD AND BAD ACCOUNTING BETWEEN ACCURATE AND INACCURATE KNOWL EDGE OF THE COSTS OF PRODUCTION IN DIFFERENT BRANCHES OF THE UNDER TAKING ONE OF THE CHIEF PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY OF SECURING ACCURATE RETURNS IS THE PROBLEM OF DEPRECIATION OF PLANT HOW MUCH SHOULD BE CHARGED OFF FOR DEPRECIATION NUMEROUS INSTANCES ARE FAMILIAR TO ACCOUNTANTS IN WHICH THE FAILURE TO RATE THIS AMOUNT PROPERLY HAS LED TO A COMPLETE MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE ENTERPRISE THE DANGER IS MUCH GREATER IN INDUS TRIES IN WHICH THE MACHINERY TOOLS ETC FORM A LARGE OR A VARIABLE PROPORTION OF THE CAPITAL OUTLAY THE THREE METHODS GENERALLY EMPLOYED ARE IST TO CHARGE OFF AN ARBITRARY AMOUNT EACH YEAR 2ND TO RECKON ANNUALLY A FIXED PROPORTION OF THE COST PRICE 3RD TO CHARGE A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THE DIMINISHING VALUE OF THE MACHINERY IN SUCH A WAY THAT AS THE ITEM OF REPAIRS RISES THE DEPRECIATION CHARGE DECREASES THE RELATIVE VALUE OF THESE THREE METHODS CAN ONLY BE ASCER TAINED BY A CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE PRINCIPLES WHICH GOVERN THEIR APPLICATION UNDER WIDELY VARYING CONDITIONS THESE PRINCIPLES HAV ING BEEN DEFINITELY ASCERTAINED FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF ACCOUNTANTS CAN BE SCIENTIFICALLY DISCUSSED IN A UNIVERSITY CLASSROOM AND BROUGHT INTO PROPER RELATION WITH OTHER IMPORTANT PARTS OF THE SUBJECT THE STUDENT WHO EXPECTS TO ENTER EITHER THE MANUFACTURING INDTSTRY OR THE PROFESSION OF ACCOUNTANCY OR WHO AS A BANKER MAY BE ASKED TO LOAN MONEY ON THE BASIS OF THE VALUATION OF A MANUFACTURING PLANT SHOULD CERTAINLY FAMILIARIZE HIMSELF WITH THE PRINCIPLES TO BE APPLIED IN THE SOLUTION OF SUCH A PROBLEM THE PERIODICAL BANK STATEMENT WITH ITS ITEMS OF RESERVES LOANS AND DEPOSITS HAS FOR THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY A SIGNIFICANCE WHICH CAN BE BROUGHT OUT CLEARLY IN THE CLASSROOM THE RELATION WHICH THIS STATEMENT BEARS TO THE AMOUNT OF MONEY AVAILABLE FOR LOANS FOR INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL PURPOSES IS SUCH AS TO MAKE IT A VALUABLE 35THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY INDICATION OF THE CHANGES AND FLUCTUATIONS OF CREDIT IN THE FIELD OF TRANSPORTATION THE VARIOUS RAIL AND WATER SYSTEMS OF THE COUNTRY SHOULD BE STUDIED BY THOSE WHO WISH TO ENTER EITHER THE RAILWAY BUSI NESS OR ANY BRANCH OF INDUSTRY WHICH MAY INVOLVE AN EXTENSIVE MOVEMENT OF FREIGHT NOT ONLY MUST THE LINES OF TRANSPORTATION BE STUDIED BUT ALSO THE ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY OF THE VARIOUS DISTRICTS OF THE COUNTRY WITH THEIR PRODUCTS AND ECONOMIC FACILITIES A MANU FACTURER WITH LARGE RAILWAY INTERESTS IN WRITING OF THE IMPORTANCE OF RAILWAY GEOGRAPHY AND SHIPPING ROUTES SAYS  I HAVE FREQUENTLY NOTICED A LAMENTABLE WANT OF KNOWLEDGE UPON THE PART OF YOUNG MEN IN OFFICES OF THE SIMPLEST MATTERS OF THE KIND COMPARATIVELY FEW YOUNG MEN ENTERING BUSINESS REALLY POSSESS THE MOST SUPERFICIAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE RAILROAD SYSTEMS OF THEIR OWN STATES THE TRANS PORTATION DEPARTMENT OF ANY BUSINESS IS YEARLY BECOMING MORE IM PORTANT AND IS CONDUCTED UPON A MORE SCIENTIFIC BASIS THAN FORMERLY SO THAT IT WOULD SEEM A FITTING COURSE TO BE HANDLED BY AN EDUCA TIONAL INSTITUTION SUCH SHOULD BE THE CHARACTER OF THE TRAINING OF ONE WHO IS TO BE EMPLOYED IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE OR EXECUTIVE WORK OF A BUSINESS ENTERPRISE IN ALL THE FIELDS OF STUDY MENTIONED AND IN MANY OTHERS SCIENTIFIC TREATISES ON THE PRINCIPLES APPLICABLE TO EACH BRANCH OF IN DUSTRY AND COMMERCE ARE APPEARING THE BUSINESS REPORTS ACCOUNTS RECORDS AND OTHER MATERIAL ARE BEING COLLECTED AND SYSTEMATIZED AND THE METHODS OF INSTRUCTION PERFECTED BUSINESS SCIENCE IS NO LONGER THE DREAM OF AN ENTHUSIAST BUT AN ACCOMPLISHED FACT AND ITS RESULTS ARE NOW BEING RAPIDLY BROUGHT TO THE SERVICE OF THE LEADERS OF IN DUSTRY AND COMMERCE FINALLY THE DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION OF BUSINESS SCIENCES AND THEIR INCLUSION IN THE UNIVERSITY CURRICULUM HAVE PLACED US IN A POSITION TO COPE WITH ONE OF THE GREAT PROBLEMS OF MODERN AMERICAN BUSINESS VIZ THE SHORTENING OF THE PERIOD OF ACTIVE BUSINESS LIFE WITH THE CONCENTRATION OF BUSINESS CAPITAL THE APPLICATION OF NEW INVENTIONS AND THE CONSEQUENT DEMAND FOR NEW TYPES OF MEN THERE HAS COME A NEW TENDENCY TO ENTRUST TO YOUNGER MEN THE EXECUTIVE WORK OF LARGE INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL PLANTS THE FIRST FEW NOTA BLE INSTANCES OF THIS CHANGE WERE REGARDED AS PURELY FORTUITOUS BUT THE SAME THING HAS RECURRED IN NEARLY ALL THE LARGE INDUSTRIES OF THE COUNTRY UNTIL IT IS NOW SEEN TO MARK AN ESSENTIAL AND IMPORTANT CHANGE IN CONDITIONS THE NEW SYSTEM HAS OBVIOUS DISADVANTAGES 36BUSINESS AND SCIENCE IT CREATES AN UNSTEADINESS OR UNCERTAINTY OF EMPLOYMENT IN THE HIGHER ROUNDS OF COMMERCIAL LIFE AND LIMITS THE PRACTICAL USEFULNESS OF THOSE WHO HAVE PASSED BEYOND A CERTAIN AGE WE MAY EVEN DOUBT IF THE CHANGE IS A PERMANENT ONE ITS CAUSES HAVE BEEN VARIOUSLY ASCRIBED TO THE GENERAL INABILITY OF MEN WHO HAVE DEVELOPED UNDER ONE INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM TO CONFORM RAPIDLY AND SUCCESSFULLY TO A NEW SET OF CONDITIONS OR TO THE GRADUAL NERVOUS AND PHYSICAL BREAKDOWN OF MEN IN EXECUTIVE WORK INCIDENT TO THE GROWTH IN MAGNITUDE OF BUSINESS ENTERPRISES OR TO THE ANCIENT AND AMUSING BUT HARMLESS DELUSION THAT COMPETITION IN ALL WALKS OF LIFE IS GROWING FIERCER THAN EVER BEFORE  AND THAT ONLY THE YOUNGER MEN CAN STAND THIS NEW STRAIN BUT WHATEVER ITS CAUSES AND DISADVANTAGES THE NEW AGE LIMIT MUST BE RECKONED WITH AS AN IMPORTANT FEATURE OF OUR INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM IF THE PERIOD OF ACTIVE WORK IN EXECUTIVE POSITIONS IS TO BE SHORTENED THOSE WHO ENTER SUCH WORK HAVE IMPERATIVE REASONS FOR STARTING OUT WITH A MORE THOROUGH MASTERY OF THE BUSINESS SCIENCES WHICH ARE APPLICABLE TO THE UNDERTAKING THE SHORTER THE PERIOD OF ACTIVITY THE MORE COMPLETE MUST BE THE PRELIMINARY TRAINING AND EQUIPMENT HERE AGAIN IT MUST BE INSISTED THAT NO AMOUNT OF PRAC TICAL EXPERIENCE CAN BE SUBSTITUTED FOR SUCH A SCIENTIFIC PREPARATION THE RISE OF BUSINESS SCIENCES IN OUR GREAT UNIVERSITIES MEANS PRE CISELY THAT THE FRUITS OF YEARS OF BUSINESS GROWTH AND EXPERIMENTA TION IN THE WIDELY VARYING UNDERTAKINGS OF AN INDUSTRY ARE COLLECTED COMPILED AND CODIFIED THEREFORE IF SUCH SCIENCES ARE TAUGHT AS THEY SHOULD BE TAUGHT THE STUDENT HAS AT HIS COMMAND A REVIEW OF FACTS AND PRINCIPLES SUCH AS IT WOULD TAKE HIM DECADES TO ACQUIRE IN THE ROUTINE WORK OF A BUSINESS HOUSE HERETOFORE IT HAS BEEN THE BELIEF OF MANY BUSINESS MEN THAT THEIR SONS CANNOT AFFORD THE TIME  TO TAKE A COLLEGE COURSE THE ADVENT OF THE UNIVERSITY IN THE FIELD OF COMMERCIAL INDUSTRIAL AND FINANCIAL SCIENCE MEANS THAT A YOUNG MAN CANNOT AFFORD THE TIME TO LEARN BUSINESS IN ANY OTHER WAY 37

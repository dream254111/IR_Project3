J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1008596,THE STANDARD OF DEFERRED PAYMENTS,I242478,THE STANDARD OF DEFERRED PAYMENTS THE WHIRLIGIG OF TIME HAS BROUGHT NO CHANGE MORE STRIK ING THAN THAT WROUGHT IN THE POSITION OF THE GOLD STANDARD MEN THE PASSAGE TO THE GOLD STANDARD WITH SILVER FOR SUB SIDIARY COIN WAS AT FIRST ADVOCATED AS A CONSERVATIVE MEASURE TO COUNTERACT THE RISING TENDENCY OF PRICES THAT APPEARED BETWEEN 1850 AND 1870 IT WAS ARGUED THAT THE RISE IN PRICES OR WHAT IS THE SAME THING THE DEPRECIATION OF THE MONEY UNIT WORKED TO THE DISADVANTAGE OF THE CREDITOR IT PERMITTED DEBTS TO BE DISCHARGED ON THE PAYMENT OF A PART OF THEIR REAL VALUE THIS TENDENCY IT WAS HOPED WOULD DIS APPEAR WITH THE PASSAGE OF WESTERN NATIONS TO THE GOLD STANDARD IT WAS NOT SUPPOSED THAT A REVERSE MOVEMENT WOULD SET IN WHEN SILVER WAS DISCARDED IT WAS BELIEVED THAT THE INCREASED PRODUCTION OF GOLD AND THE MULTIPLICATION OF DEVICES FOR ECONOMIZING THE USE OF MONEY WOULD BALANCE THE GROWTH IN POPULATION WEALTH AND BUSINESS AND SUFFICE TO MAINTAIN PRICES AT ABOUT THE SAME LEVEL THUS SECURING JUS TICE AS BETWEEN DEBTOR AND CREDITOR SUCH WERE THE AIMS AND HOPES OF THE HONEST ADVOCATES OF THE GOLD STANDARD BUT THE UNERRING TESTIMONY OF STATISTICS HAS SHOWN BEYOND THE SHADOW OF A DOUBT THAT THESE HAVE NOT BEEN REALIZED THE UPWARD MOVEMENT OF PRICES HAS NOT ONLY BEEN CHECKED BUT HAS BEEN SUCCEEDED BY A DECLINE THAT PERSISTS TO THE PRESENT DAY AS THIS FACT BECAME CLEARER THERE AROSE THE SCHOOL OF BIMETALLISTSA SCHOOL THAT CLAIMS TODAY MANY ACTIVE AND ENTHUSIASTIC ADHERENTS IN ALL THE LEADING NATIONS THE RAISON DRTRE OF THE BIMETALLISTS WHETHER NATIONAL OR INTERNATIONAL IS THE NEED OF MORE MONEY TO ALL OBJECTIONS ON THE GROUND OF THE EXPENSE THE INCONVENIENCE THE RISK OR THE SHOCK TO BUSINESS HABIT OCCASIONED BY THE RESTORATION OF SILVER BIMETALLISTS HAVE ONE UNFAILING ANSWERTHE DIRE NEED 29338 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF MORE MONEY IN ORDER TO PREVENT INJUSTICE TO THE DEBTOR CLASS THE EXISTENCE OF THIS INJUSTICE IS THE JUSTIFICATION AND THE EXCUSE FOR BEING OF THE BIMETALLIST SCHOOL IF IT DOES NOT EXIST THEN THE REST OF THE REASONING FALLS TO THE GROUND OF WHAT USE TO SHOW THE PRACTICABILITY OF BIMETALLISM OR ITS EFFICIENCY IN ENLARGING THE CIRCULATING MEDIUM IF THE PRESENT GOLD STANDARD DAMAGES NO ONE  THE ARGUMENT SHOWING THE INJURY THE DEBTOR CLASS RECEIVES FROM FALLING PRICES IS THE PRIMARY FUNDAMENTAL ARGUMENT ON WHICH ALL THE OTHER BIMETALLIST ARGUMENTS ARE BUILT BREAK DOWN THIS AND THE WHOLE THEORY FALLS TO THE GROUND THE ARGUMENT USUALLY TAKES THE FOLLOWING FORM  OWING TO THE CONSTANTLY WIDENING USE OF CREDIT AN INCREAS ING PROPORTION OF MONEY PAYMENTS ARE MADE IN PURSUANCE OF TIME CONTRACTS CALLING FOR SPECIFIED FUTURE SUMS OF MONEY THESE TIME CONTRACTS ARE ALWAYS BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE MONEY UNIT THEY VIRTUALLY CONTAIN AN IMPLIED CLAUSE TO THE EFFECT THAT THE FUTURE UNITS CALLED FOR BY THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT SHALL BE OF THE SAME VALUEI E OF THE SAME PUR CHASING POWERAS THE PRESENT UNIT THIS WE MUST SUPPOSE ELSE ONE PARTY OR THE OTHER WOULD REFUSE TO SIGN THE CONTRACT NOW IF DURING THE PERIOD OF THE TIME CONTRACT CHANGE TAKES PLACE IN THE PURCHASING POWER OF THE UNIT THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT ARE EQUALLY CHANGED IF THE UNIT CHEAPENS THE CREDITOR LOSES IN FAVOR OF THE DEBTOR IF THE UNIT APPRE CIATES THE DEBTOR LOSES TO THE CREDITOR NOW WHAT WE CALL APPRECIATION OR INCREASE IN GENERAL PURCHASING POWER IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS FALL IN PRICE THE TERMS DESIGNATE THE SAME PHENOMENON THE ONE EXPRESSING ITS RELATION TO MONEY THE OTHER ITS RELATION TO COMMODITIES FALL IN PRICES MEANS RISE IN PURCHASING POWER AND HENCE INJURY TO THE DEBTOR AND GAIN TO THE CREDITOR NOW A GENERAL FALL IN PRICES HAS OCCURRED DURING THE LAST TWENTY YEARS AND STILL CONTINUES THE AVERAGE FALL PER YEAR HAS BEEN NOT FAR FROM TWO PER CENT THIS MEANS A STUPENDOUS DISASTER TO THE DEBTOR CLASS APPLIED TO THE FARM MORTGAGES ALONE WRITTEN IN FOUR WESTERN STATES BETWEEN 188O AND 189O 2941THE STANDARD OF DEFERRED PAYMENTS 39 IT REPRESENTS AN ARBITRARY TRANSFER FROM DEBTORS TO CREDITORS OF TWENTYTHREE MILLIONS EVERY YEAR A MONETARY SYSTEM IHEN WHICH PERMITS SUCH A FALL IN PRICES IS SELFCONDEMNED AND CANNOT MAINTAIN ITSELF IN THE FACE OF THE PUBLIC CONSCIENCE IT IS DISHONEST AND INIQUITOUS THE GREAT LAW OF JUSTICE DEMANDS THAT THE CIRCULATION BE ENLARGED UNTIL THE FALL IN PRICES CEASES SUCH IS THE GREAT CORNERSTONE OF THE BIMETAL LIST THEORY HOW HAS THE ARGUMENT BEEN MET BY THE GOLD STANDARD MEN  AT FIRST THEY SAVED THEIR REPUTATION FOR SCIENTIFIC SOUND NESS BY DENYING ANY FALL IN PRICES THIS WAS EASY SO LONG AS THE FACTS WERE OVERLAID AND DISGUISED BY OTHER PHENOMENA BUT WHEN AFTER A BRIEF STANDSTILL DURING THE PROSPEROUS TIMES IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES PRICES ONCE MORE EX HIBITED A STEEP DOWNWARD TENDENCY THE TRUTH COULD NO LONGER BE DENIED BUT THE ADMISSION OF THIS TRUTH COM PLETELY ALTERED THE SCIENTIFIC BASIS OF THE GOLD MONOMETALLISTS WHEREAS FORMERLY THEY HAD BEEN STRENUOUS FOR STEADY PRICES AND A CONSTANT PURCHASING POWER THEY MUST NOW DEFEND A STANDARD WHICH SECURED NEITHER IN THIS EMERGENCY VARIOUS MODES OF ESCAPE WERE RESORTED TO SOME DENIED THAT FALLING PRICES INJURED THE DEBTOR BUT WERE SURE THAT RISING PRICES WERE UNFAVORABLE TO THE CREDITOR SOME REPRESENTED THE BIMETALLISTS AS SEEKING TO DEPRECIATE THE STANDARD AND THUS TO ROB THE CREDITOR SOME ECONOMISTS IN THEIR ANXIETY TO JUSTIFY THE GOLD STANDARD TURNED TRAITORS TO THEIR OWN SCIENCE AND DENIED ANY RELATION BETWEEN QUANTITY OF MONEY AND PRICES SOME ADMITTED THE INJUSTICE OF THE GOLD STANDARD BUT POINTED OUT THE DANGER OR IMPRACTICABILITY OF BIMETALLISM FINALLY A FEW MET THE ARGUMENT OF THE BIMETALLISTS FAIRLY AND SOUGHT A SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION OF THE FALL IN PRICES LET US ADDRESS OURSELVES TO THEIR ARGUMENT THE FALL OF PRICES THEY SAY IS NATURAL RATHER THAN ARTIFICIAL NORMAL RATHER THAN ARBITRARY IT IS DUE TO THE ABUNDANCE OF COMMODITIES RATHER THAN TO THE LACK OF MONEY RELATIVE TO POPULATION THE OUTPUT OF COMMODITIES HAS OF LATE YEARS 295140 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY ENORMOUSLY INCREASED OWING TO EXTRAORDINARY IMPROVEMENTS IN PRODUCTION NEW INVENTIONS AND THE PERFECTING OF OLD ONES HAVE CHEAPENED ALMOST ALL MANUFACTURED ARTICLES RAW MATERIALS AND FOOD PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN CHEAPENED PARTLY BY THE OPENING UP OF NEW SOURCES OF SUPPLY PARTLY BY THE WONDERFUL CHEAPENING OF TRANSPORTATION ALL ALONG THE LINE THE ECONOMIES RESULTING FROM ABLER INDUSTRIAL LEADERSHIP BETTER INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION MINUTER DIVISION OF LABOR AND THE INCREASE IN THE PROPORTION OF SKILLED AND SPECIALIZED WORKERS HAVE CONSPIRED TO DIMINISH THE COST OF PRODUCTION NOW CHEAPENING OF PRODUCTION MEANS THAT THE RELATION BETWEEN LABOR AND PRODUCTS BETWEEN HUMAN EFFORT AND ITS ECONOMIC RESULTS HAS ALTERED THE EXCHANGE RATIO IS DIF FERENT IF A DAYS WORK IS MORE EFFICIENTI E PRODUCES MOREIT IS MORE VALUABLE IN TERMS OF COMMODITIES IF COMMODITIES ARE PRODUCED WITH GREATER EASE AND ABUNDANCE THEY ARE LESS VALUABLE IN TERMS OF LABOR LABOR PRODUCES AND HENCE COMMANDS MORE COMMODITIES COMMODITIES REQUIRE AND HENCE COMMAND LESS LABOR BY REASON OF THIS CHANGE IN RELATION THE TWO CAN NO LONGER BEAR THE SAME RELA TION TO MONEY THE PRICE MOVEMENT OF LABOR CANNOT BE JUST THE SAME AS THAT OF COMMODITIES NOW WHAT ARE THE FACTS  THE PRICES OF COMMODITIES HAVE FALLEN HAS THE PRICE OF LABOR FALLEN  IT APPEARS NOT FROM TWO FACTS I WAGES HAVE NOT FALLEN 2 MONEY INCOMES IN GENERAL HAVE NOT FALLEN THIS MEANS THAT LABOR PRODUCES AND THAT CONSE QUENTLY THE EARNINGS OF LABOR COMMAND A STEADILY INCREASING QUANTITY OF COMMODITIES BEARING THESE CONCLUSIONS IN MIND LET US REEXAMINE THE SITUATION OF THE DEBTOR IT APPEARS NOW THAT THE SUM OF MONEY THAT HE REPAYS TO HIS CREDITOR ALBEIT IT REPRESENTS MORE COMMODITIES THAN THE ORIGINAL SUM BORROWED REPRE SENTS NO MORE LABOR TO PROCURE THE MONEY THE DEBTOR MAY HAVE HAD TO SELL DOUBLE THE QUANTITY OF GOODS THE ORIGINAL LOAN WAS WORTH BUT IF AT THE SAME TIME GENERAL INDUSTRIAL EFFICIENCY HAS BEEN DOUBLED BY IMPROVEMENT IN PRODUCTION HE CAN PRODUCE WITH HIS LABOR TWICE THE QUANTITY 296THE STANDARD OF DEFERRED PAYMENTS 41 OF PRODUCTS THE CREDITOR WAS FORMERLY ABLE TO PRODUCE THE CREDITOR WORKED AND SAVED IN ORDER TO LOAN THE ORIGINAL SUM THE DEBTOR WORKS AND SAVES THE SAME LENGTH OF TIME IN ORDER TO REPAY IT SO THE BORROWER BUT RESTORES THE QUANTITY OF LABOR HE RECEIVED THE TRANSACTION IS BUT AN EXCHANGE OF EQUAL SERVICES WITH AN INTERVAL OF TIME BETWEEN AND AS ALL FAIR EXCHANGE ACCORDING TO THE CLASSIC ECONOMISTS AND TO SOME OF THE GREAT SOCIALISTS IS BUT THE EXCHANGE OF EQUAL SERVICES OR OF THE PRODUCTS OF EQUAL QUANTITIES OF LABOR WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT IN THIS CASE THE SCALES OF JUSTICE ARE HELD EVEN THE DEBTOR SUFFERS NO HARDSHIP BY THE FALL IN THE PRICES OF COMMODITIES SUCH IS THE MONOMETALLIST ARGUMENT IT IS NOW THE OBJECT OF THIS PAPER TO EXAMINE THE VALIDITY OF THESE ARGUMENTS AND TO INQUIRE WHAT STANDARD OF DEFERRED PAYMENT IF ANY WILL INSURE JUSTICE TO BOTH DEBTOR AND CREDITOR FOR THE SAKE OF CONVENIENCE THE ARGUMENTS CITED MAY BE HELD TO INVOLVE TWO CONTROVERSIES I AS TO THE ULTIMATE STANDARD OF VALUE 2 AS TO THE DESTINATION OF THE BENEFIT OF INDUSTRIAL PROGRESS I WILL EXAMINE THESE IN THEIR ORDER THE BIMETALLIST CONTENDS THAT BY REASON OF FALLING PRICES THE DEBTOR PLACES THE CREDITOR IN COMMAND OF MORE COM MODITIES THAN THE ORIGINAL LOAN WOULD PURCHASE WHEREAS JUSTICE REQUIRES THAT THE QUANTITY OF COMMODITIES LENT AND THE QUANTITY OF COMMODITIES RESTORED SHOULD BE EQUAL THE MONOMETALLIST CONTENDS THAT OWING TO THE FACT THAT THE PRICE OF LABOR HAS NOT FALLEN THE DEBTOR PLACES THE CREDI TOR IN COMMAND OF NO MORE LABOR THAN THE ORIGINAL LOAN WOULD HAVE PURCHASED AND THIS IS RIGHT FOR JUSTICE REQUIRES THAT THE QUANTITY OF LABOR LENT AND THE QUANTITY OF LABOR RESTORED SHOULD BE EQUAL NOW BOTH PARTIES ADMIT THAT THE QUESTION INVOLVED IS A QUESTION OF JUSTICE AND AS BOTH AGREE THAT ECONOMIC JUSTICE CONSISTS IN THE EXCHANGE OF EQUAL VALUES IT FOLLOWS THAT THE 29742 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY CONTROVERSY FINALLY HINGES ON THE NATUIE OF VALUE THE BIMETALLIST ASSERTS THAT EQUAL QUANTITIES OF GOODS ARE OF EQUAL VALUE THOUGH SEPARATED BY A PERIOD OF TIME THE MONO METALLIST HOLDS THAT EQUAL QUANTITIES OF LABOR ARE OF EQUAL VALUE THOUGH SEPARATED BY A PERIOD OF TIME SINCE THE COM MODITIES THE BIMETALLIST HAS IN MIND ARE IN FACT USUALLY CONSUMPTION GOODS RATHER THAN RAW MATERIALS OR SUBPRO DUCTS WHILE THE LABOR THE MONEMETALLIST HAS IN MIND IS IN FACT PRODUCTIVE LABOR RATHER THAN SERVICES THE ISSUE IS FAIRLY JOINED BETWEEN THE TWO GREAT OPPOSING THEORIES OF VALUE THAT OF LABORVALUE AND THAT OF USEVALUE THE ONE DERIVES VALUE FROM PRODUCTION THE OTHER FROM CONSUMPTION THE ONE LOOKS TO COST THE OTHER TO UTILITY SO THAT THE GREAT TYPICAL FACT OF ECONOMIC LIFE VIZ THAT MAN MAKES A SACRIFICE IN ORDER TO PROCURE A SATISFACTION OFFERS TWO CRITERIA FOR JUDGING A CREDIT TRANSACTION WE CAN SAY THAT EVERY LOAN IS SIMPLY A SACRIFICE MADE BY THE CREDITOR IN BEHALF OF THE DEBTOR AND THAT FULL PAYMENT MEANS THAT THE DEBTOR MAKES A CORRESPONDING SACRIFICE IN RETURN OR WE CAN SAY THAT A LOAN IS SIMPLY A SATISFACTION ENJOYED BY THE DEBTOR AT THE EXPENSE OF THE CREDITOR AND THAT FULL PAYMENT MEANS THAT THE CREDITOR PROCURES A CORRESPONDING SATISFACTION AT THE EXPENSE OF THE DEBTOR WHICH OF THESE TWO THEORIES OF VALUE IS THE TRUE ONE  THE BASING OF VALUE ON SACRIFICE IS RADICALLY WRONG INAS MUCH AS SACRIFICE IS BUT A MEANS TO AN END SACRIFICE POSSESSES IMPORTANCE OR VALUE ONLY BECAUSE IT IS THE PRIMARY CONDITION TO SOMETHING IMPORTANT OR VALUABLE THE PRODUCT OR GOOD STANDING MIDWAY BETWEEN SACRIFICE AND SATISFACTION IS VALU ABLE NOT BECAUSE IT EMBODIES PAST SACRIFICES BUT BECAUSE IT PROMISES FUTURE SATISFACTIONS TO IMPUTE VALUE TO AN ARTICLE ON ACCOUNT OF ITS COST IS LIKE ASCRIBING MERIT TO A MAN ON ACCOUNT OF HIS ANCESTORS THE OLD HABIT OF BASING VALUE ON COST OF PRODUCTION IN LABOR CAPITAL BEING REGARDED AS ACCUMULATED LABOR RECEIVED NO SHOCK SO LONG AS ECONOMISTS OBSERVED ONLY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRIES OF CONSTANT RETURNS BUT THE WIDENING IMPORTANCE 298THE STANDARD OF DEFERRED PAYMENTS 43 OF MONOPOLIZED GOODS AND OF GOODS OF DIMINISHING RETURNS BROUGHT TO LIGHT AN INCREASING NUMBER OF CASES WHERE VALUES ARE NOT PROPORTIONATE TO COST THIS HAS COMPELLED A PRO FOUNDER STUDY RESULTING IN THE DISCOVERY THAT VALUE IS A PARTICULAR UTILITYIS IN FACT MARGINAL UTILITY THE IDEA THROWN OUT BY JEVONS AND ELABORATED BY THE AUSTRIAN ECONOMISTS HAS CHANGED THE FACE OF ECONOMIC THEORY WITHIN A FEW YEARS AND HAS FILLED WITH ENTHUSIASM AND HOPE MANY WHO HAD DESPAIRED OF THE SCIENCE BY FURBISHING UP THE OBSOLETE AND DISCREDITED LABORVALUE THEORY IN ORDER TO BEAT THE BIMETALLISTS THE GOLD STANDARD DEFENDERS HAVE SHOWN THEMSELVES THE BOURBONS OF POLITICAL ECONOMY BY INSISTING THAT THE LABOR STANDARD SHOULD BE ADOPTED FOR THE TRANSACTIONS OF BORROWER AND LENDER THEY VIRTUALLY DEMAND AN EXCEPTION IN THE ECONOMIC ORDER THEY WANT TO MEASURE THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE DEBTOR BY A SPECIAL STANDARD OF THEIR OWN FOR WHERE IN SOCIETY DO WE FIND EXCHANGERS BARTERING EQUAL QUANTITIES OF LABOR WORTH UNEQUAL QUANTITIES OF GOODS IT IS INDEED DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT THE CON TRACTIONISTS ARE SINCERE IN THEIR ARGUMENT EXCEPT ON THE CHARITABLE HYPOTHESIS THAT THEY DO NOT SEE WHITHER THEIR THEORY LEADS THEM FOR IF LABOR OR COST IS THE JUST BASIS OF VALUE THEN WHATEVER EXCEEDS THIS IS ILLEGITIMATE HENCE PART OF THE VALUE OF MONOPOLIZED GOODS RESTING AS IT DOES ON THEIR UTILITY TO THE CONSUMER RATHER THAN ON THEIR COST TO THE PRODUCER IS ILLEGITIMATE PLUNDER RATHER THAN JUST EARNINGS THIS BEING TRUE WE SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND THESE LABORVALUE MONOMETALLISTS FIGHTING WITH TOOTH AND NAIL FOR SUCH LEGISLA TION AS WOULD BREAK DOWN CORNERS COMBINES AND TRUSTS AND NATIONALIZE SUCH NATURAL MONOPOLIES AS THE RAILROAD AND THE TELEGRAPH BUT ON THE CONTRARY WE FIND MANY OF THESE SAME GENTLEMEN VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING THE JUSTICE OF MONO POLY VALUES IN UTTER CONTEMPT OF SCIENTIFIC CONSISTENCY THEY WITH ONE HAND SHIELD THE CREDITOR WITH THE LABORVALUE THEORY WHILE WITH THE OTHER THEY INTERPOSE THE USEVALUE ARGUMENT BETWEEN MONOPOLISTS AND THE WRATH OF AN OUTRAGED PUBLIC THEIR CONSISTENCY IS ONE NOT OF DOCTRINE BUT OF SYMPATHIES 299144 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY WHICH ARE ALWAYS ON THE SIDE OF THE IS AND AGAINST THE TO BE THE CONTROVERSY PERTAINING TO THE NATURE OF VALUE IS THERE FORE DECIDED IN FAVOR OF THE BIMETALLIST LET US NOW TAKE UP THE CONTROVERSY TOUCHING THE PROPER DESTINATION OF THE BENEFITS OF INDUSTRIAL PROGRESS SUPPOSE A MAN LEND A SUM REPRESENTING THE PRODUCTS OF A HUNDRED DAYS LABOR AT THE END OF TWENTY YEARS THE GENERAL IM PROVEMENT IN PRODUCTION HAS BEEN SUCH THAT THE SAME GOODS CAN BE PRODUCED BY SIXTY DAYS LABOR THE BIMETALLIST CON TENDS THAT SIXTY DAYS LABOR OR ITS EQUIVALENT IN COMMODITIES SHOULD SATISFY THE DEBT THE VALUE OF FORTY DAYS LABOR REPRESENTING THE BENEFIT OF INDUSTRIAL PROGRESS REMAINS WITH THE DEBTOR THE MONOMETALLIST CONTENDS THAT ONE HUNDRED DAYS LABOR OR ITS EQUIVALENT IN COMMODITIES SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO SATISFY THE DEBT THE VALUE OF FORTY DAYS LABOR BEING THE PREMIUM DUE TO THE ADVANCE OF INDUSTRY SHOULD THEREFORE BE MADE OVER TO THE CREDITOR IN OUR DISCUSSION OF THE POINT HERE RAISED WE SHALL CONSIDER THREE POSSIBLE CASES R THE CREDITOR REAPS THE BENEFIT 2 THE DEBTOR REAPS THE BENEFIT 3 THE BENEFIT IS SHARED WE SHALL TAKE THESE IN THEIR ORDER IN BEHALF OF THE CREDITORS CLAIM IT MAY BE URGED THAT JUSTICE BETWEEN DEBTOR AND CREDITOR DEMANDS EQUAL SACRIFICES QUITE REGARDLESS OF ANY INCREASE IN THE POWER OF SACRIFICES TO PROCURE SATISFACTIONS THIS ARGUMENT AS WE HAVE SEEN INVOLVES THE LABORVALUE FALLACY AND IS THEREFORE WORTHLESS IT MAY NEXT BE URGED THAT AS THE MAIN IMPROVEMENT IN PRODUCTION COMES THROUGH IMPROVEMENT IN MACHINERY THE SUPPLIER OF CAPITAL SHOULD GET THE BENEFIT THIS ARGUMENT IS UNSOUND FOR SEVERAL REASONS ONLY PART OF THE CAPITAL LENT IS INVESTED IN MACHINERY THEN ONLY A PART OF THE IMPROVE MENT DUE TO INVENTION APPEARS IN MACHINERY THE REST APPEARING IN METHODS AND PROCESSES MOREOVER INVENTION IS ONLY ONE OF SEVERAL CAUSES OF IMPROVEMENT AGAIN THE 300THE STANDARD OF DEFERRED PAYMENTS 45 LENDER SUPPLIES PURE CAPITAL AND HAS NO MORAL CLAIM TO ANY GAIN RESULTING FROM FIXING IT IN USEFUL AND EVER MORE USEFUL FORMS THE LENDER DOES NOT INVENT MAKE SELECT OR RUN THE NEW OR IMPROVED MACHINE FINALLY IT MAY BE SAID THAT THE INCREASING HELPFULNESS OF PURE CAPITAL AS IT IS INVESTED IN BETTER AND BETTER MACHINERY IS ALREADY DISCOUNTED IN THE RATE OF INTEREST PAID SO THE CREDITOR NEED NOT EXPECT A SECOND REWARD A THIRD ARGUMENT FOR THE CREDITOR ASSERTS THAT BY MAKING THE LOAN HE CURTAILED HIS EXPENDITURES AND HENCE DROPPED A GRADE IN SOCIETY NOW AS WITH IMPROVEMENT IN PRODUCTION THE GENERAL SCALE OF EXPENDITURE IN SOCIETY RISES THE CREDITOR IN ORDER TO REGAIN HIS FORMER RELATIVE POSITION AS A CONSUMER MUST RECEIVE FROM HIS DEBTOR AN EXCESS OF GOODS CORRESPOND ING TO THE GENERAL ADVANCE THIS WILL JUST ABSORB THE MARGIN DUE TO THE INCREASED EFFICIENCY OF HUMAN EFFORT THIS ARGUMENT ASSUMES THAT THE CREDITOR HAD HE NOT LENT WOULD HAVE EXPENDED HIS CAPITAL IN MAINTAINING A CERTAIN STYLE OF LIVING BUT BY THUS CONSUMING HIS CAPITAL HE COULD NOT HAVE DRAWN FROM IT AN INCOME IN THE WAY OF INTEREST TO PARALLEL THIS BENEFIT HE MUST INVEST HIS CAPITAL PRODUC TIVELY BUT IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT CONSUME IT AND COULD NOT HAVE MAINTAINED A HIGHER SCALE OF EXPENDITURE THAN AS LENDER HE ACTUALLY HAS MAINTAINED A MONOPOLY OF THE BENEFIT OF PROGRESS BY THE CREDITOR THEREFORE SEEMS UNJUST LET US NOW CONSIDER THE CASE FOR THE DEBTOR IT MAY FIRST BE URGED ON HIS BEHALF THAT EVEN ON THE LABORVALUE THEORY HE IS NOT BOUND TO SURRENDER HIS ADVANTAGE FOR THE TRUE LABORVALUE THEORY INSISTS THAT EQUAL VALUES ARE REPRESENTED BY EQUAL QUANTITIES OF LABOR PROVIDED THE QUALITY IS THE SAME ONLY THE CRUDEST THEORIST COULD ASSERT THAT AN HOURS LABOR OF THE HODMAN IS EQUAL IN VALUE TO AN HOURS LABOR OF THE ENGRAVER OR THE OPTICIAN NOW THE QUALITY OF LABOR MEANS CHIEFLY THE EFFICIENCY OF LABOR AND THIS BEING SO HOW CAN WE SAY THAT THE LABOR OF THE CREDITOR UNDER ONE INDUSTRIAL DISPENSATION IS OF THE SAME QUALITY AS THE LABOR OF HIS DEBTOR UNDER A HIGHER DISPENSATION THE 30146 ANNALS OF THE A MERICAN ACADEMY CREDITOR GROUND FLOUR IN AN OLDFASHIONED NEIGHBORHOOD MILL THE DEBTOR ASSOCIATED WITH 700 OTHERS GRINDS FLOUR IN A PILLSBURY A AT MINNEAPOLIS THE LABOR OF THESE TWO MAY BE OF THE SAME RELATIVE GRADE BUT BECAUSE OF DIFFERENT EFFICIENCY AND HENCE OF DIFFERENT QUALITY WE CANNOT JUSTLY SET A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF THIS LABOR OVER AGAINST AN EQUAL QUANTITY OF THE OTHER AND CALL THEM EQUIVALENT THE DEBTOR HENCE SHOULD ENJOY THE BENEFITS OF INDUSTRIAL PROGRESS RATHER THAN THE CREDITOR SIMPLY BECAUSE AFTER ALL IT IS HIS LABOR THAT IS THE MORE EFFICIENT AND NOT THAT OF THE CREDITOR TO REVERSE THIS WOULD BE WHOLLY ARBITRARY BUT IT MAY BE URGED SECONDLY THAT IN ANY CASE THE DEBTOR IS NOT BOUND TO SQUARE HIS CONDUCT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE LABOR STANDARD TO SEE HOW UNNATURAL AND ABSURD THIS WOULD BE LET US APPLY A TEST THE CLASS OF EXCHANGES BETWEEN DEBTOR AND CREDITOR IS BUT A SPECIES OF A WIDE GENUS OF TRANSACTIONS THIS GENUS INCLUDES ALL EXCHANGES OF LIKE GOODS PRODUCED UNDER DIFFERENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT IS UNDER SYSTEMS OF INDUSTRY DIFFERING IN THE RATIO BOTH GENETIC AND EXCHANGE BETWEEN LABOR AND COMMODITIES IN ALL THESE EXCHANGES THE COMPARING OF QUANTITIES OF LABOR WILL NOT YIELD THE SAME RESULT AS THE COMPARING OF QUANTITIES OF PRODUCTS NOW WE MAY FIND DIFFERENT INDUSTRIAL STAGES IN THE SAME COUNTRY AT DIFFERENT PERIODS OR IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AT THE SAME PERIOD THE DIFFICULTY BETWEEN DEBTOR AND CREDITOR PRESUPPOSES THE FORMER LET US TAKE A CASE RESTING UPON THE LATTER A POOR ESKIMO IN DOING A SERVICE TO A HUDSON BAY TRAPPER LOSES HIS KNIFE THAT KNIFE WAS MADE BY RUBBING A PIECE OF STEEL ON A STONE UNTIL IT BECAME A BLADE IT REPRESENTS THE LABOR OF THREE MONTHS TO BE JUST THE TRAPPER MUST RESTORE EQUAL VALUE DOES THAT MEAN THAT HE IS TO REPLACE THE LOST BLADE WITH A SHEFFIELD KNIFE COSTING HIM HALF A DAYS LABOR OR THAT ACCEPTING THE LABOR STANDARD HE IS TO SURRENDER THE EQUIVALENT OF HIS WAGES FOR THE LAST THREE MONTHS THIS REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM APPLIES AS WELL TO EX CHANGES BETWEEN DIFFERENT INDUSTRIAL PERIODS AS TO EXCHANGES BETWEEN DIFFERENT INDUSTRIAL COMMUNITIES 302THE STANDARD OF DEPFRRED PAYMENTS 47 THE EXISTENCE OF A JUST CLAIM ON THE PART OF THE DEBTOR HAVING BEEN SHOWN WE HAVE NOW TO INQUIRE WHETHER HE SHOULD RETAIN ALL THE BENEFITS ARISING FROM IMPROVEMENT IN PRODUCTION OR SHOULD SHARE THEM WITH THE CREDITOR IN BEHALF OF THE THEORY OF PARTICIPATION IT MIGHT BE URGED THAT AS THE INCREASED EFFICIENCY OF THE DEBTOR IS DUE TO CHANGES MADE IN THE GENERAL INDUSTRIAL CONSTITUTION OF SOCIETY HE SHOULD YIELD THE CREDITOR A SHARE OF THE BENEFITS BUT THIS DOCTRINE THOUGH A FAVORITE OF SOME MONOMETALLISTS IS UN SOUND THE INCREASING EFFICIENCY OF INDUSTRY IS DUE MAINLY TO IM PROVEMENT IN MACHINERY ORGANIZATION OR SKILL NOW THESE IMPROVEMENTS ARE DUE TO THOSE WHO PARTICIPATE IN PRODUCTION AS INVENTORS ENTREPRENEURS OR WORKERS HENCE TO THESE GROUPS CONSTITUTING AS THEY DO THE BODY OF PRESENT PRO DUCERS BELONGS THE REWARD THE CREDITOR AS SUCH IS A PAST PRODUCER THE CAPITAL HE LENT BEING THE PRODUCT OF LABOR AT SOME PAST PERIOD THEN WHY AS PAST PRODUCER SHOULD HE HAVE THE RIGHT TO ENJOY THE SUPERIOR EXCELLENCE OF PRESENT PRODUCTION  SUPPOSE HOWEVER THE CREDITOR HAS BEEN NOT ONLY A CREDITOR AND HENCE AN INTEREST RECEIVER BUT ALSO AN ACTIVE PRODUCER AS INVENTOR ENTREPRENEUR OR WORKMAN IN THIS CASE I REPLY VERILY HE HAS HIS REWARD AS A PARTICIPANT IN PRODUCTION HE GETS HIS SHARE OF THE BENEFITS OF INDUSTRIAL PROGRESS IS THAT NOT ENOUGH  OR SHALL HE AS CREDITOR RE CEIVE A SECOND REWARD FOR HIS PARTICIPATION IN INDUSTRY ON THE SIDE OF PRODUCTION THEN THE CREDITOR HAS NO VALID RIGHT TO SHARE WITH THE DEBTOR BUT LET US VIEW HIS CASE A MOMENT FROM THE SIDE OF CONSUMPTION AVAILING THEMSELVES OF THE NEW DOCTRINE OF VALUE THE MONOMETALLISTS MIGHT CLAIM THAT AS WITH CHEAPENED PRO DUCTION THE ABUNDANCE OF GOODS INCREASES THEIR MARGINAL UTILITIES MUST FALL AND HENCE THEIR VALUE IN ORDER TO RESTORE TO HIS CREDITOR EQUAL VALUE THE DEBTOR MUST INCREASE THE QUANTITY OF GOODS OR COMMAND OVER GOODS SUFFICIENTLY TO OFFSET THE FALL IN MARGINAL UTILITY BUT THIS IS FALLACIOUS INASMUCH AS MARGINAL UTILITIES ARE SIMPLY VALUES AND A 30348 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY GENERAL DECLINE IN MARGINAL UTILITIES IS AS IMPOSSIBLE AS A GENERAL DECLINE IN VALUES LET US TAKE A CONCRETE CASE A MAN HAS SOME VALUABLE OBJECT WHICH CAN BE USED WITHOUT BEING WORN OUT OR CONSUMEDSAY A MIRROR HE USES IT TWENTY YEARS AT THE END OF THIS TIME MIRRORS ARE SO ABUNDANT AND CHEAP THAT THEIR MARGINAL UTILITY HAS SUNKEN ONEHALF SHALL WE SAY THAT THE MAN HAS LOST BY THIS FACT CERTAINLY NOT THE MIRROR YIELDS HIM THE SAME UTILITY AS BEFORE VARY THE HYPOTHESIS SUPPOSE THE MAN RENTS HIS MIRROR FOR TWENTY YEARS RECEIVING ANNUALLY A PAYMENT FOR ITS USE AT THE END OF TWENTY YEARS HE RECEIVES BACK THE ORIGINAL MIRROR UNINJURED SHALL WE SAY THAT THE BORROWER WAS BOUND TO RETURN AN EXTRA MIRROR BECAUSE THE MARGINAL UTILITY OF MIRRORS HAS FALLEN  CER TAINLY NOT HE SHOULD RETURN SIMPLY WHAT HE BORROWED VARY THE HYPOTHESIS AGAIN SUPPOSE THE BORROWER BREAK OR LOSE THE ORIGINAL MIRROR IS HE BOUND TO RESTORE TWO OF THE NEWER AND CHEAPER MIRRORS  CERTAINLY NOT HE NEED MERELY REPLACE THE ORIGINAL MIRROR WITH ONE CAPABLE OF YIELDING THE SAME OBJECTIVE UTILITY DECLINE IN MARGINAL UTILITY I CON CLUDE IS NO GROUND FOR PARTICIPATION WE ARE THROWN BACK UPON OBJECTIVE UTILITIES DO THESE EVER DECLINE  UNDOUBTEDLY AND HERE I THINK WE COME UPON THE ONLY VALID ARGUMENT FOR THE DOCTRINE OF PARTICIPATION FROM ALL THE GOODS THAT YIELD HIM NOURISHMENT WARMTH SHELTER HEALING COMFORT AMUSEMENT INTELLECTUAL AND AESTHETIC ENJOYMENT ETC A MAN CAN DERIVE AS MUCH UTILITY ONE YEAR AS ANOTHER FOR THESE PURPOSES A THOUSAND UNITS OF PURCHASING POWER ARE AS VALUABLE ONE TIME AS ANOTHER BUT FOR THE PROCURING OF SOCIAL ESTEEM THIS DOES NOT HOLD TRUE TEN YEARS AGO I LENT YOU THE PROCEEDS OF A COACH AND FOUR WHICH PROCURED FOR ME AT THAT TIME A CERTAIN SOCIAL DIS TINCTION NOW YOU RETURN ME A COACH AND FOUR BUT THE OBJECTIVE UTILITY IS NOT THE SAME AND I AM THE LOSER OWING TO THE GENERAL INDUSTRIAL PROGRESS AND THE CONSEQUENT ABUN DANCE OF COACHES AND FOUR I MUST NOW HAVE A COACH AND SIX IN ORDER TO ENJOY THE SAME SOCIAL DISTINCTION IN THE WAY OF 304THE STANDARD OF DEFERRED PAYMENTS 49 PROCURING FROM MY FELLOWMEN DISTINCTION FAME INFLUENCE ESTEEM RESPECT ETC EQUAL QUANTITIES OF COMMODITIES ARE NOT OF EQUAL VALUE IT WOULD THEREFORE SEEM BUT JUST THAT THE CREDITOR SHOULD PARTICIPATE IN THE BENEFITS ARISING FROM GENERAL INDUSTRIAL PROGRESS SUFFICIENTLY TO COMPENSATE HIM FOR THE DE PRECIATION OF THAT PORTION OF HIS WEALTH DEVOTED TO SATISFYING THE NEEDS OF HIS SOCIAL NATURE THIS CLOSES OUR EXAMINATION OF THE TWO OPPOSING ARGUMENTS WE PLACED AT THE HEAD OF THIS PAPER WE FIND THE MONOME TALLIST ARGUMENT WHOLLY UNSOUND BUT WE DO NOT FIND THE BIMETALLIST ARGUMENT ENTIRELY RIGHT THE DEBTOR IS NOT TO RETURN A VALUE MEASURED IN LABOR NOR YET A VALUE MEASURED IN COMMODITIES BUT A VALUE MEASURED IN OBJECTIVE UTILITY AND WITH INDUSTRIAL PROGRESS THIS IS SECURED BY A SLIGHT EXCESS OF COMMODITIES DURING INDUSTRIAL PROGRESS THEN A JUST MONETARY STANDARD SHOULD PERMIT THE ALTERATION IN THE RATIO BOTH GENETIC AND EX CHANGEBETWEEN LABOR AND COMMODITIES TO APPEAR IN A RISING PRICE OF LABOR RATHER THAN IN FALLING PRICES FOR COMMODITIES THE MONEY UNIT SHOULD NOT APPRECIATE WITH LABOR BUT SHOULD RATHER DEPRECIATE WITH COMMODITIES THE CIRCULATING MEDIUM SHOULD SUFFICE TO MAINTAIN RETAIL PRICES OF COMMODITIES AT VERY NEARLY THEIR FORMER LEVEL COMPARED WITH THIS IDEALLY JUST STANDARD THE PRESENT GOLD STANDARD IS SEEN TO BE UNJUST AND THE MUCHVAUNTED GOLD DOLLAR APPEARS IN ITS TRUE LIGHT AS A DISHONEST DOLLAR SERVING THE CREDITOR CLASS AS AN INSTRUMENT OF WHOLESALE SPOLIATION AND OPPRESSION EDWARD ALSWORTH ROSS CORNELL UNIVERSITY 3051

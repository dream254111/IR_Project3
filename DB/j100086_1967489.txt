curve Find the position of its axis major and the position of the foci when the angle between the diameter and the axis major of the greater ellipse is a maximum R H Graves SOLUTION It is known that  if any two chords OP OQ of a conic make equal angles with the tangent at 0 the line PQ will cut that tangent in a fixed point See Smiths Conic Sections p 2I I The fixed point is clearly the pole of the normal at 0 It follows that the required foci are the points of intersection of the given ellipse and a right line joining its centre and the pole of the normal at 0 xy The equation to this line

point at which are three coin cident tangents this line passes through the intersection point of the bitangent with the line of junction of the two points of inflexion of the curve F H Loud SOLUTION Writing the equation of the curve 412Y3  ax4  4bX3y t 6cX2y2  4dxy3  ey4 and putting u yx I find for the points of inflexion a  2bu  cu2 0 The coordinates x and y are easily expressed in terms of u and hence the equation x y y y x  x  Pt y  of a line through two given points may be written in terms of the parameters ul and u2 of the two points and becomes x a u14  u24  4buM2 u13  u23  6cU12u22

SOLUTION OF EXERCISES SOLUTION The instantaneous centre is the join of the normal and the parallel to the axis from the point where the tangent cuts the tangent at the vertex This point is the middle point of the normal If the curve be 21 2px the normal at xy is Y y 3 x x f and its extremities are xy and x  p o Its middle point is x 2P 2Y accordingly the required locus is 432 2pX p2 a parabola

curvature at the node of the Folium of Descartes pass through the middle point of the arc of the loop R H Glvzes SOLUTION The equation of the Folium of Descartes in Cartesian coordinates is   3axY  X 3  The form of the equation shows that the curve is symmetrical with respect to an axis which bisects the angle between the original axes If we transform to this by putting x  v and x  yjf in place of x and y we obtain y2b3x X2b X r b7 xA where b 3 12 a The ordinate y having values with opposite signs between x  o and x  it fol lows that the centre of gravity of the loop is on the axis of x Let dS

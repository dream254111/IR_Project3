j101009,The Virginia Law Register,1098827,The Liability of Infants for Torts Connected with Contracts,i245832,VitGitNIA LAW REGISTEZR law An able and lengthy discussion of the doctrine may also be found in Smith v Elliott 1 P  H 307 It is well settled that where it is sought to recover payments of usuri ous interest and in other cases where the law is for the protection of one of the parties against the other the doctrine of in pari delicto has no application See Moseley v Brown 76 Va 419 In most of the Virginia cases hitherto cited this question is also briefly considered In Gray v Roberts Ky 12 Am Dec 383 it is held that money paid for lottery tickets may be recovered when the lottery is prohibited by law the law being for the protection of the purchasers Attention is called to the editors note to this case In Carpenter v McClure 91 Am Dec 370 the Supreme Court of Vermont announced the same rule as that laid down in Harris v Harris supra One of the latest adjudications involving the application of the maxim is Bradtfeldt v Cook Oreg 50 Am St Rep 701 wherein Harris v Harris supra is cited with approval by the court For a good discussion of the rule and its application see note to Collins v Blantern 1 Sm Lead Cas 9 Am ed 662 See also Burtrers v Keran 24 Gratt 42 70 Barnett v Barnett 83 Va 508 Smith v Chilton 84 Va 840 extensive note 3 Am St Rep 727 D 0 DECHERT Harrisonburg Va THE TTARILITY OF INFANTS FOR TORTS CONNECTILD Wll CONTRACTS An infant is liable for his torts  If an infant commit an assault or utter slander said Lord Kenyon  God forbid that he should not be answerable for it in a court of justice But when the tort is connected with a contract the question becomes more complicated for an infants contract is not binding upon him The leading case upon the subject is Vasse v Smith 6 Cranch 226 s c 1 H  W Am Lead Cases 293 In this case it was decided among other things that 1 In an action on the case the declaration shows upon the face that the tort is merely constructive being in effect but a breach of con tract and a plea of infancy is a bar 724 FebLIABILITY OF INFANTS FOR TORTS 2 In trover the liability does not appear from the declaration and it cannot be told whether the action is brought for a pure tort or such merely constructive conversion as consists only in a breach of con tract and infancy cannot as a special plea be a bar It appears then from this case that an infant is not liable when the tort is in effect but a breach of contract Let us examine the authorities on this point Although an infant is liable for his torts he is not liable for the tortious consequences of his breach of contract The tort must be a distinct and substantive wrong in itself to make the infant liable 10 Am  Eng Encyc Law 1st ed 669 and cases cited See 2 Kent 241 Acts however aggravated which merely establish a breach of con tract on the part of the infant manifestly are insufficient Moore v Eastman 1 Hun 578 If an infants wrongful act though concerned with the subject matter of the contract and such that but for the contract there would have been no opportunity of committing it is nevertheless inde pendent of the contract in the sense of not being the act contemplated by it or being the act expressly forbidden by it then the infant is lia ble 10 Am  Eng Encyc Law 1st ed 669 note 4 citing Pollock on Contracts 55  If such tort or fraud consists in the breach of contract then he is not liable therefor in an action sounding in tort because this would make him liable for his contract merelyby a change in the form of action which the law does not permit Where the tort though con nected by circumstances with the contract is still distinguishable from it there he is liable 1 Pars Con 275 See also Chitty Con 149 n 3 2 Kent 241 2 Addis Torts 1126 2 Greenl on Ev sec 368 We think the fair result of the American as well as the English cases is that an infant is liable in an action ex delicto for an act of willful fraud only in cases in which the form of action does not sup pose that a contract has existed but that where the gravemen of the fraud consists in a transaction which really originated in a contract infancy is a good defence Gilsor v Spear 38 Vt 311 There are but few authorities contra Among these may be men tioned Jennings v Rundell 8 T R 331 Wood v Vance 1 N  McC 197 Peigne v Sutcliffe 4 McC 387 People v Kendall 25 Wend 399 And see dicta in Norris v Wait 2 Rich 151 and Evans v Terry 1 Brev 80 where opinions are expressed that the 1897 725VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER plaintiff might maintain an action for the deceit practised on her by the defendant a minor in the breach of his promise of marriage See also Tyler Inf 184 where it is said The contract and the fraud in the contract are distinct things and while not liable for the former the infant if doli capax is responsible for the latter Manifestly however these decisions are erroneous and directly con trary to the general tenor of the authorities which I have cited In Fitts v Hall 9 N H 441 a distinction is suggested of this nature viz that an infant is not liable for a fraudulent affirmation which makes a part of the contract but is liable for fraudulent repre sentations anterior or subsequent to the contract and not a parcel of it as for instance where he induced a party to contract with him by fraudulently representing himself to be of age Tyler on Inf 184 But the law is most assuredly otherwise 1 H  W Lead Ca 323 10 Am  Eng Encyc Law 1st ed 670 Benj Sales 16 2 Kent 241 2 Greenl Ev sec 368 In Sims v Everhardt 102 U S 300 Strong J said An estoppel in pais is not applicable to infants and a fraudulent representation of capacity cannot be an equivalent for actual capacity  A contemporaneous declaration of his right or of his age adds noth ing to what is implied in his deed There seems to be a tendency in equity to hold an infant liable for fraudulent representations as to his age especially where his appear ance bears out his assertions 10 Am  Eng Encyc Law 1st ed 670 Benj Sales sutpra The question of the liability of infants for torts connected with con tracts is an open one in Virginia In Fry v Leslie 87 Va 274 Lewis P said  An infant is liable for his tortthat is an injury not arising oult of a breach of contractjust as an adult is But this is a dictum The law on this subject briefly stated is therefore as follows 1 To make an infant liable for a tort connected with contract the tort must be a distinct and substantive wrong in itself 2 A liability really ex contractu cannot be changed into a liability ex delicto by altering the form of action and 3 While there is a tendency in equity to hold an infant liable for fraudulent representations as to his age the doctrine of estoppel is not applicable to infants and at laiw an infant is not liable for such fraudulent representations DAVID H LEAKE Licking Va 726 Feb

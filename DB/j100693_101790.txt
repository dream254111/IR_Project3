J100693,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 16651678,101790,AN ACCOUNT OF IRONWORKS IN THE FOREST OF DEAN COMMUNICATED BY HENRY POWLE ESQUIRE,I206877,AN ACCOUNT OF THE IRONWORKS IN THE FOREST OF DEAN COMMUNI CATED BY HENRY POWLE ESQUIRE THE FOREST OF DEAN COMPREHENDING THAT PART OF GLOCESTER SHIRE THAT LIES BETWIXT THE RIVERS OF WYE AND SEVERNE CONSISTS GENERALLYY OF A STIFF CLAY WHICH ACCORDING TO THE NATURE OF THOSE SOYLSIS VERY DEEP AND MIRY IN THE WINTERAND IN THE SUMMER AS DRY AND PARCHED THE COUNTRY IS FULL OF HILLS BUT SO AS YOU MAY RATHER CALL IT UNEVEN THAN MOUNTAINOUS THEY BEING NO WHERE HIGH AND RARELY OF A STEEP ASCENT BETWIXT THEM RUN GREAT STORE OF LITTLE SPRINGS OF A MORE BROWNISH CO LOUR THAN ORDINARY WATERS AND OFTEN LEAVING IN THEIR PASSAGE TINCTURES OF RUST THE GROUND IS NATURALLY INCLINED TO WOOD ESPECIALLY HASLE AND OAK OF WHICH LAST SORT IT HATH PRODUCED FORMERLY MOST STATELY TIMBER THOUGH NOW ALMOST TOTALLY DE VOURED BY THE INCREASE OF THE IRONWORKS 6 G 2 UPON932 UPON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH IN MANY PLACES LIE AN ABUN DANCE OF ROUGH STONESSOME OF THEM OF A VAST BULK BUT WHERE THEY SINK THEIR MINES THEY RATHER MEET WITH VEINS OF SCALY STONE THAN HARD AND SOLID ROCKS WITHIN THE FOREST THEY FIND GREAT PLENTY OF COAL AND IRONORE AND IN SOME PLACES RED AND YELLOW OKER WHICH ARE ALL THE MINERALS THAT ARE YET DIS COVERED THERE I HAVE BEEN THE MORE PARTICULAR IN THIS DESCRIPTION BECAUSE I THINK IT NOT IMPOSSIBLE THAT BY AN EXACT COMPARING OF THE NATURE AND PRODUCTIONS OF SUCH SOYLS WHERE MINERALS ARE USUALLY FORMED WE MAY ARRIVE TO A CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE OR AT LEAST A VERY PROBABLE CONJECTURE IN WHAT PLACES WE OUGHT TO SEARCH AFTER THEIR SEVERAL SORTS AND WHEN TO DESIST THE IRONORE WHICH IS THE PRINCIPAL MANUFACTURE HERE AND BY WHICH MOST OF THE INHABITANTS SUBSIST IS FOUND IN GREAT A BUNDANCE IN MOST PARTS OF THE FOREST DIFFERING BOTH IN COLOUR WEIGHTAND GOODNESS THE BEST WHICH THEY CALL THEIR BRUSH ORE IS OF A BLEWISH COLOUR VERY PONDEROUSAND FULL OF LITTLE SHINING SPECKS LIKE GRAINS OF SILVER THIS AFFORDS THE GREATEST QUANTITY OF IRON BUT BEING MELTED ALONE PRODUCETH A METAL VERY SHORT AND BRITTLE AND THEREFORE NOT SO FIT FOR COMMON USE TO REMEDY THIS INCONVENIENCYTHEY MAKE USE OF ANOTHER SORT OF MATERIAL WHICH THEY CALL THEIR CYNDER AND IS NOTHING ELSE BUT THE REFUSE OF THE ORE AFTER THE METAL HATH BEEN EXTRACTED WHICH BEING MINGLED WITH THE OTHER IN A DUE QUANTITY GIVES IT THAT EXCELLENT TEMPER OF TOUGHNESS FOR WHICH THIS IRON IS PRE FERRED BEFORE ANY THAT IS BROUGHT FROM FOREIN PARTS BUT TO UNDERSTAND THIS RIGHTLY IT IS TO BE NOTED THAT IN FOR MER TIMES WHEN THEIR WORKS WERE FEW AND THEIR VENT SMALL THEY MADE USE OF NO OTHER BELLOWS BUT SUCH AS WERE MOVED BY THE STRENGTH OF MEN BY REASON WHEREOF THEIR FIRES WERE MUCH LESS INTENSE THAN IN THE FURNACES THEY NOW EMPLOY SO THAT HAVING IN THEM MELTED DOWN ONLY THE PRINCIPAL PART OF THE ORE THEY REJECTED THE REST AS USELESS AND NOT WORTH THEIR CHARGE THIS THEY CALL THEIR CYNDER WHICH IS NOW FOUND IN AN UNEXHAUSTIBLE QUANTITY THROUGH ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTREY WHERE ANY FORMER WORKS HAVE STOOD AFTER THEY HAVE PROVIDED THEIR ORE THEIR FIRST WORK IS TO CALCINE IT WHICH IS DONE IN KILNS MUCH AFTER THE FASHION OF OUR ORDINARY LIMEKILNS THESE THEY FILL UP TO THE TOP WITH COAL933 COAL AND ORE STRATUM SUPER STRATUMUNTIL IT BE FULL AND SO PUT TING FIRE TO THE BOTTOM THEY LET IT BURN TILL THE COAL BE WASTED AND THEN RENEW THE KILNS WITH FRESH ORE AND COAL IN THE SAME MANNER AS BEFORE THIS IS DONE WITHOUT FUSION OF THE METAL AND SERVES TO CONSUME THE MORE DROSSY PARTS OF THE ORE AND TO MAKE IT FRIABLE SUPPLYING THE BEATING AND WASHING WHICH ARE USED TO OTHER METALS FROM HENCE THEY CARRY IT TO THEIR FURNACES WHICH ARE BUILT OF BRICK OR STONE ABOUT 24 FOOT SQUARE ON THE OUTSIDEAND NEAR 30 FOOTIN HEIGHT WITHIN NOT ABOVE 8 OR 10 FOOT OVER WHERE IT IS WIDEST WHICH IS ABOUT THE MIDDLE THE TOP AND BOTTOM HAVING A NARROWER COMPASS MUCH LIKE THE SHAPE OF AN EGG AS IN THE FIGURE SEE FIG 4 A THE TUNNELC THE FURNACE B THE MOUTH OF THE FURNACE BEHIND THE FURNACE ARE PLACED TWO HUGE PAIR OF BELLOWS WHOSE NOSES MEET AT A LITTLE HOLE NEAR THE BOTTOM THESE ARE COMPRESSED TOGETHER BY CERTAIN BUTTONS PLACED ON THE AXIS OF A VERY LARGE WHEEL WHICH IS TURND ABOUT BY WATER IN THE MANNER OF AN OVERSHOTMILL AS SOON AS THESE BUTTONS ARE SLID OFF THE BELLOWS ARE RAISED AGAIN BY THE COUNTERPOISE OF WEIGHTS WHEREBY THEY ARE MADE TO PLAY ALTERNATELY THE ONE GIVING ITS BLAST ALL THE TIME THE OTHER IS RISING AT FIRST THEY FILL THESE FURNACES WITH ORE AND CYNDER INTER MIXT WITH FUEL WHICH IN THESE WORKS IS ALWAYS OF CHAR COAL LAYING THEM HOLLOW AT THE BOTTOM THAT THEY MAY MORE EASILY TAKE FIRE BUT AFTER THEY ARE ONCE KINDLED THE MATERIALS RUN TOGETHER INTO A HARD CAKE OR LUMP WHICH IS SUSTAINED BY THE FASHION OF THE FURNACE AND THROUGH THIS THE METAL AS IT MELTS TRICKLES DOWN INTO THE RECEIVERS WHICH ARE PLACED AT THE BOT TOM WHERE THERE IS PASSAGE OPEN BY WHICH THEY TAKE AWAY THE SCUM AND DROSS AND LET OUT THE METAL AS THEY SEE OCCASION BEFORE THE MOUTH OF THE FURNACE LIES A GREAT BED OF SAND WHEREIN THEY MAKE FURROWS OF THE FASHION INTO WHICH THEY DE SIRE TO CAST THEIR IRON INTO THESE WHEN THEIR RECEIVERS ARE FULL THEY LET IN THEIR METAL WHICH IS MADE SO VERY FLUID BY THE VIOLENCE OF THE FIRE THAT IT NOT ONLY RUNS TO A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE BUT STANDS AFTERWARDS BOILING FOR A GOOD WHILE AFTER THESE FURNACES ARE ONCE AT WORK THEY KEEP THEM CONSTANTLY EMPLOYED FOR MANY MONTHS TOGETHER NEVER SUF FERING THE FIRE TO SLACKEN NIGHT NOR DAY BUT STILL SUPPLYING THE934 THE WASTE OF THE FUEL AND OTHER MATERIALS WITH FRESH POURED IN AT THE TOP SEVERAL ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO BRING IN THE USE OF SEA COAL IN THESE WORKS INSTEAD OF CHARCOAL THE FORMER BEING TO BE HAD AT AN EASIE RATE THE LATTER NOT WITHOUT GREAT EX PENCE BUT HITHERTO THEY HAVE PROVED INEFFECTUAL THE WORK MEN FINDING BY EXPERIENCE THAT A SEACOAL FIREHOW VEHEMENT SOEVER WILL NOT PENETRATE THE MOST FIXD PARTS OF THE ORE AND SO LEAVETH MUCH OF THE METAL UNMELTED FROM THESE FURNACES THEY BRING THEIR SOWS AND PIGS OF IRON AS THEY CALL THEM TO THEIR FORGES THESE ARE OF TWO SORTS THOUGH STANDING TOGETHER UNDER THE SAME ROOF ONE THEY CALL THEIR FINERY THE OTHER THE CHAFERY BOTH OF THEM ARE OPEN HEARTHS ON WHICH THEY PLACE GREAT HEAPS OF SEACOAL AND BEHIND THEM BELLOWS LIKE TO THOSE OF THE FURNACES BUT NOTHING NEAR SO LARGE INTO THE FINERY THEY FIRST PUT THEIR PIGS OF IRON PLACING THREE OR FOUR OF THEM TOGETHER BEHIND THE FIREWITH A LITTLE OF ONE END THRUST INTO IT WHERE SOFTENING BY DEGREES THEY STIR AND WORK THEM WITH LONG BARS OF IRON TILL THE METAL RUNS TOGETHER INTO A ROUND MASS OR LUMP WHICH THEY CALL A HALFBLOOM THIS THEY TAKE OUT AND GIVING IT A FEW STROKES WITH THEIR SLEDGES THEY CARRY IT TO A GREAT WEIGHTY HAMMER RAISED LIKEWISE BY THE MOTION OF A WATERWHEEL WHERE APPLYING IT DEXTEROUSLY TO THE BLOWS THEY PRESENTLY BEAT IT OUT INTO A THICK SHORT SQUARE THIS THEY PUT INTO THE FINERY AGAIN AND HEATING IT RED HOT THEY WORK IT OUT UNDER THE SAME HAMMER TILL IT COMES INTO THE SHAPE OF A BAR IN THE MIDDLE WITH TWO SQUARE KNOBS IN THE ENDS LAST OF ALL THEY GIVE IT OTHER HEATINGS IN THE CHAFERY AND MORE WORKINGS UN DER THE HAMMERTILL THEY HAVE BROUGHT THEIR IRON INTO BARS OF SEVERAL SHAPES AND SIZES IN WHICH FASHION THEY EXPOSE THEM TO SALE ALL THEIR PRINCIPAL IRON UNDERGOES ALL THE FOREMENTIONED PREPARATIONS YET FOR SEVERAL PURPOSES AS FOR THE BACKS OF CHIMNEYS HEARTHS OF OVENS AND THE LIKE THEY HAVE A SORT OF CASTIRON WHICH THEY TAKE OUT OF THE RECEIVERS OF THE FURNACE SO SOON AS IT IS MELTED IN GREAT LADLES AND POUR IT INTO MOULDS OF FINE SAND IN LIKE MANNER AS THEY CAST BRASS AND OTHER SOFTER METALS BUT THIS SORT OF IRON IS SO VERY BRIT TLE THAT BEING HEATED WITH ONE BLOW OF A HAMMER IT BREAKS ALL TO PIECES THOUGH935 THOUGH THIS FAULT BE MOST FOUND IN THIS SORT OF IRON YET IF IN THE WORKING OF THEIR BEST SORT THEY OMIT ANY ONE PROCESS IT WILL BE SURE TO WANT SOME PART OF ITS TOUGHNESS WHICH THEY ESTEEM ITS PERFECTIONFIG4 A 24 FOOT 28 FOOT 10 FOOT C B

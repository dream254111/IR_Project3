J100587,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 16831775,105987,ON THE NOXIOUS QUALITY OF THE EFFLUVIA OF PUTRID MARSHES A LETTER FROM THE REV DR PRIESTLEY TO SIR JOHN PRINGLE,I206929,90 VIII ON THE NOXIOUS QUALITY OF THE EFFLUVIA OF PUTRID MARSHES A LETTER FROM THE REV DR PRIESTLEY TO SIR JOHN PRINGLE TO SIR J O H N P R I N G L E BARONET D E A R S I R H A V I N G PURSUED MY EXPERI MENTS ON DIFFERENT KINDS OF AIR CONSIDERABLY FARTHER IN SEVERAL RESPECTS THAN I HAD DONE WHEN I PRESENTED THE LAST ACCOUNT OF THEM TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY AND BEING ENCOURAGED BY THE FAVOURABLE NOTICE WHICH THE SOCIETY HAS BEEN PLEASED TO TAKE OF THEM I SHALL CONTINUE MY COMMUNICATIONS ON THIS SUBJECT BUT WITHOUT WAITING FOR THE RESULT OF A VARIETY OF PROCESSES WHICH I HAVE NOW GOING ON OR OF OTHER EXPERI MENTS WHICH I PROPOSE TO MAKE I SHALL FROM TIME TO TIME COMMUNICATE SUCH DETACHED ARTICLES AS I SHALL HAVE GIVEN THE MOST ATTENTION TO AND WITH RESPECT TO WHICH I SHALL HAVE BEEN THE MOST SUCCESSFUL IN MY INQUIRIES REDDE DEO 16 1773 SINCE THE PUBLICATION OF MY PAPERS I HAVE READ TWO TREATISES WRITTEN BY DR ALEXANDER OF EDIN BURGH AND AM EXCEEDINGLY PLEASED WITH THE SPIRIT 1 OF91 OF PHILOSOPHICAL INQUIRY WHICH THEY DISCOVER THEY APPEAR TO ME TO CONTAIN MANY NEW CURIOUS AND VALUABLE OBSERVATIONS BUT ONE OF THE CONCLUSIONS WHICH HE DRAWS FROM HIS EXPERIMENTS I AM SATIS FIED FROM MY OWN OBSERVATIONS IS ILL FOUNDED AND FROM THE NATURE OF IT MUST BE DANGEROUS I MEAN HIS MAINTAINING THAT THERE IS NOTHING TO BE AP PREHENDED FROM THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF PUTRID MARSHES I WAS PARTICULARLY SURPRIZED TO MEET WITH SUCH AN OPINION AS THIS IN A BOOK INSCRIBED TO YOURSELF WHO HAVE SO CLEARLY EXPLAINED THE GREAT MISCHIEF OF SUCH A SITUATION IN YOUR EXCELLENT TREATISE ON THE DISEASES OF THE ARMY ON THIS ACCOUNT I HAVE THOUGHT IT NOT IMPROPER TO ADDRESS TO YOU THE FOL LOWING OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS WHICH I THINK CLEARLY DEMONSTRATE THE FALLACY OF DR ALEXANDERS REASONING INDISPUTABLY ESTABLISH YOUR DOCTRINE AND INDEED JUSTIFY THE APPREHENSIONS OF ALL MANKIND IN THIS CASE I THINK IT PROBABLE ENOUGH THAT PUTRID MATTER AS DR ALEXANDER HAS ENDEAVOURED TO PROVE WILL PRESERVE OTHER SUBSTANCES FROM PUTREFACTION BE CAUSE BEING ALREADY SATURATED WITH THE PUTRID EFFLUVIUM THEY CANNOT READILY TAKE ANY MORE BUT DR ALEXANDER WAS NOT AWARE THAT AIR THUS LOAD ED WITH PUTRID EFFLUVIUM IS EXCEEDINGLY NOXIOUS WHEN TAKEN INTO THE LUNGS I HAVE LATELY HOWEVER HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF FULLY ASCERTAINING HOW VERY NOXIOUS SUCH AIR IS HAPPENING TO USE AT CALNE A MUCH LARGER TROUGH OF WATER FOR THE PURPOSE OF MY EXPERIMENTS THAN I HAD DONE AT LEEDS AND NOT HAVING FRESH WATER N 2 SO92 SO NEAR AT HAND AS I HAD THERE I NEGLECTED TO CHANGE IT TILL IT TURNED BLACK AND BECAME OF FENSIVE BUT BY NO MEANS TO SUCH A DEGREE AS TO DETER ME FROM MAKING USE OF IT IN THIS STATE OF THE WATER I OBSERVED BUBBLES OF AIR TO RISE FROM IT AND ESPECIALLY IN ONE PLACE TO WHICH SOME SHELVES THAT I HAD IN IT DIRECTED THEM AND HAVING SET AN INVERTED GLASS VESSEL TO CATCH THEM IN A FEW DAYS I COLLECTED A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF THIS AIR WHICH ISSUED SPONTANEOUSLY FROM THE PUTRID WATER AND PUTTING NITROUS AIR TO IT I FOUND THAT NO CHANGE OF COLOUR OR DIMINUTION ENSUED SO THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE NOXIOUS I REPEATED THE SAME EXPERIMENT SEVERAL TIMES AFTER WARDS AND ALWAYS WITH THE SAME RESULT AFTER THIS I HAD THE CURIOSITY TO TRY HOW WHOLESOME AIR WOULD BE AFFECTED BY AGITATION IN THIS WATER WHEN TO MY REAL SURPRISE I FOUND THAT AFTER ONE MINUTE ONLY A CANDLE WOULD NOT BURN IN IT AND AFTER THREE OR FOUR MINUTES IT WAS IN THE SAME STATE WITH THE AIR WHICH HAD ISSUED SPON TANEOUSLY FROM THE SAME WATER I ALSO FOUND THAT COMMON AIR CONFINED IN A GLASS VESSEL IN CONTACT ONLY WITH THIS WATER AND WITH OUT ANY AGITATION WOULD NOT ADMIT A CANDLE TO BURN IN IT AFTER TWO DAYS THESE FACTS CERTAINLY DEMONSTRATE THAT AIR WHICH EITHER ARISES FROM STAGNANT AND PUTRID WATER OR WHICH HAS BEEN FOR SOME TIME IN CONTACT WITH IT MUST BE VERY UNFIT FOR RESPIRATION AND YET DR ALEXANDERS OPINION IS RENDERED SO PLAUSIBLE BY HIS EXPERIMENTS THAT IT IS VERY POSSIBLE THAT MANY PERSONS MAY BE RENDERED SECURE AND THOUGHTLESS 3 OF93 OF DANGER IN A SITUATION IN WHICH THEY MUST NE CESSARILY BREATHE IT ON THIS ACCOUNT I HAVE THOUGHT IT RIGHT TO MAKE THIS COMMUNICATION AS EARLY AS I CONVENIENTLY COULD AND AS DR ALEX ANDER APPEARS TO BE AN INGENUOUS AND BENEVOLENT MAN I DOUBT NOT BUT HE WILL THANK ME FOR IT THAT AIR ISSUING FROM WATER OR RATHER FROM THE SOFT EARTH OR MUD AT THE BOTTOM OF PITS CON TAINING WATER IS NOT ALWAYS UNWHOLESOME I HAVE ALSO HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF ASCERTAINING TAKING A WALK ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO IN THE NEIGHBOUR HOOD OF WAKEFIELD IN YORKSHIRE I OBSERVED BUBBLES OF AIR TO ARISE IN REMARKABLY GREAT PLENTY FROM A SMALL POOL OF WATER WHICH UPON IN QUIRY I WAS INFORMED HAD BEEN THE PLACE WHERE SOME PERSONS HAD BEEN BORING THE GROUND IN ORDER TO FIND COAL THESE BUBBLES OF AIR HAVING EX CITED MY CURIOSITY I PRESENTLY RETURNED WITH A BASON AND OTHER VESSELS PROPER FOR MY PURPOSE AND HAVING STIRRED THE MUD WITH A LONG STICK I SOON GOT ABOUT A PINT OF THIS AIR AND EXAMINING IT FOUND IT TO BE GOOD COMMON AIR AT LEAST A CANDLE BURNED IN IT VERY WELL I HAD NOT THEN DISCOVERED THE METHOD OF ASCERTAINING THE GOODNESS OF COM MON AIR BY A MIXTURE OF NITROUS AIR PREVIOUS TO THE TRIAL I HAD SUSPECTED THAT THIS AIR WOULD HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE INFLAMMABLE I SHALL CONCLUDE THIS LETTER WITH OBSERVING THAT I HAVE FOUND A REMARKABLE DIFFERENCE IN DIFFERENT KINDS OF WATER WITH RESPECT TO THEIR EFFECT ON COMMON AIR AGITATED IN THEM AND WHICH I AM NOT YET ABLE TO ACCOUNT FOR IF I AGITATE COMMON AIR IN THE WATER OF A DEEP WELL NEAR MY HOUSE IN CALNE94 CALNE WHICH IS HARD BUT CLEAR AND SWEET A CANDLE WILL NOT BURN IN IT AFTER THREE MINUTES THE SAME IS THE CASE WITH THE RAIN WATER WHICH I GET FROM THE ROOF OF MY HOUSE BUT IN DISTILLED WATER OR THE WATER OF A SPRINGWELL NEAR THE HOUSE I MUST AGITATE THE AIR ABOUT 20 MINUTES BEFORE IT WILL BE SO MUCH INJURED IT MAY BE WORTH WHILE TO MAKE FARTHER EXPERIMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THIS PROPERTY OF WATER IN CONSEQUENCE OF USING THE RAIN WATER AND THE WELL WATER ABOVEMENTIONED I WAS VERY NEAR CON CLUDING CONTRARY TO WHAT I HAVE ASSERTED IN MY PRINTED PAPERS THAT COMMON AIR SUFFERS A DECOM POSITION BY GREAT RAREFACTION FOR WHEN I HAD COLLECTED A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF AIR WHICH HAD BEEN RAREFIED ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED TIMES BY AN EX CELLENT PUMP MADE FOR ME BY MR S M E A T O N I AL WAYS FOUND THAT WHEN I FILLED MY RECEIVERS WITH THE WATER ABOVEMENTIONED THOUGH I DID IT SO GRADUALLY AS TO OCCASION AS LITTLE AGITATION AS POSSIBLE A CANDLE WOULD NOT BURN IN THE AIR THAT REMAINED IN THEM BUT WHEN I USED DISTILLED WATER OR FRESH SPRING WATER I UNDECEIVED MYSELF I THINK MYSELF HONOURED BY THE ATTENTION WHICH FROM THE FIRST YOU HAVE GIVEN TO MY EXPERIMENTS AND AM WITH THE GREATEST RESPECT DEAR SIR YOUR MOST OBLIGED HUMBLE SERVANT LONDON 7 DEC 1773 J P R I E S T L E Y P O S T95 P O S T S C R I P T I CANNOT HELP EXPRESSING MY SURPRIZE THAT SO CLEAR AND INTELLIGIBLE AN ACCOUNT OF MR S M E A T O NS AIRPUMP SHOULD HAVE BEEN BEFORE THE PUBLIC SO LONG AS EVER SINCE THE PUBLICATION OF THE FORTY SEVENTH VOLUME OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSAC TIONS AND YET THAT NONE OF OUR PHILOSOPHICAL IN STRUMENT MAKERS SHOULD ATTEMPT THE CONSTRUCTION THE SUPERIORITY OF THIS PUMP TO ANY THAT ARE MADE UPON THE COMMON PLAN IS INDEED PRODIGIOUS FEW OF THEM WILL RAREFY MORE THAN 100 TIMES AND IN A GENERAL WAY NOT MORE THAN 60 OR 70 TIMES WHEREAS THIS INSTRUMENT MUST BE IN A POOR STATE INDEED IF IT DO NOT RAREFY 200 OR 300 TIMES AND WHEN IT IS IN GOOD ORDER IT WILL GO AS FAR AS 1000 TIMES AND SOMETIMES EVEN MUCH FARTHER THAN THAT BESIDES THIS INSTRUMENT IS WORKED WITH MUCH MORE EASE THAN A COMMON AIRPUMP AND EITHER EXHAUSTS OR CONDENSES AT PLEASURE IN SHORT TO A PERSON ENGAGED IN PHILOSOPHICAL PURSUITS THIS INSTRUMENT IS AN INVALUABLE ACQUISITION I SHALL HAVE OCCASION TO RECITE SOME EXPERIMENTS WHICH I COULD NOT HAVE MADE AND WHICH INDEED I SHOULD HARDLY HAVE DARED TO ATTEMPT IF I HAD NOT BEEN POSSESSED OF SUCH AN AIRPUMP AS THIS IT IS MUCH TO BE WISHED THAT SOME PERSON OF SPIRIT IN THE TRADE WOULD ATTEMPT THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN IN STRUMENT WHICH WOULD DO GREAT CREDIT TO HIMSELF AS WELL AS BE OF EMINENT SERVICE TO PHILOSOPHY IX FARTHER

given below indicates how active a discussion has been taking place of late on cer tain phases of railway administration in Prussia Some ac count of this discussion may be of interest to Englishspeaking students of railway matters and of public business manage ment For convenience in following its course the various publications have been grouped under three heads which rep resent roughly their chronological sequence In the first group are four pamphlets which criticise more or less severely the existing administration In the second are two more impartial in tone commending some things condemning others and suggesting remedies for admitted evils Finally in the third we have some quasiofficial statements from men  1 Zur Kritik der preussischen Staatseisenbahnverzualtung

JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS high in the administrative hierarchy who may be supposed to give the views of the powers that be From one source and another the administration of the state railways of Prussia has been attacked on various points as to the mechanical condition of the railways as to the organization of the working force and the efficiency of the administrative machinery and finally as to the training of the higher officials These complaints run together and can not easily be set forth separately but it is probable that they stand for different sorts of real difficulties and it is at all events helpful to distinguish them in considering the individ ual pamphlets and articles The whole discussion seems to have begun with some arti cles published in the iNational Zeitung of Berlin in the sum mer and autumn of 1891 which were later reprinted in the first pamphlet cited in our list These articles attacked the state railways for inferiority in mechanical matters and for a supposedly detrimental predominance in the general manage ment of administrators having only a legal training As to mechanical defects the brake question received most atten tion Ten or a dozen years ago the state railways adopted the Carpenter brake in preference to the Westinghouse brake The former is now alleged to be ineffective and unsatisfactory and the administration is accused of having made a serious mistake in adopting it That mistake again is said to have been due to insufficient knowledge among the managing offi cials The education of these administrators is chiefly in the law They are JTristen Their training has been exclusively legal and they are unable to form an independent or trust worthy judgment on mechanical matters The second of the attacking pamphlets Die Entwickelung unserer Staatseisenbahnen followed much the same lines as the first but gave more attention to alleged mechanical le fects The writer set forth that the rails were badly con structed and badly laid the whole ober Bau  rails ties and the resttoo weak the rails insecurely supported and un evenly laid the riding rough hence the impossibility of run ning very fast trains The methods of English railways wereRAILWAY MANAGEMENT IN PRUSSIA declared to be much superior and to offer a model which the Prussian roads should imitate at once Further the signal ling methods and station arrangements were said to be inferior to the English Interlocking and automatic signals are little in use The system in Germany a thoroughly vicious one leading to accilents like that at Bergedorf is to rely on punctilious obedience to highly complicated instructions on the part of officials whose attention is absorbed by many and varied duties The locomotives also are said to be inferior to the English The administration adopted at one time standard passenger and freight locomotives to be used on all the state railways at a time when the improvement of locomo tives was progressing fast in England It is true that steps were taken later towards constructing other and larger engines but it is alleged that the better plan would have been to make no attempt at uniformity and to allow each division or Direk tion to work at the problem for itself thus securing some helpful variety and competition When the Stadtbahn was opened in Berlin the engines there put in service were built on the standard type although according to our author they were not adapted to the peculiarities of that service Other complaints on this score are added which need not be further detailed the nature of the criticisms being sufficiently indi cated by those already cited The same writer attacks the existing methods of manage ment on another groundpedantry in examinations and appointments There is an excess of examinations especially among the engineers and technical experts Thus candidates for what we should call the mastermechanics department the Maschinen  techniker must pass at least four examina tions of which but one is said to be practical the rest requir ing mere textbook memorizing In general our critic finds an excessive amount of red tape All this is supposed to be due to the absence of healthy competition and to present a significant contrast to the successes achieved by the Germans in private industries competing in the open market with the English In the third publication on our list Unsere Staatseisen 7980 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS bahnen something more is said by this practical author of the physical condition of the roadbed the track the rails something also of the excessive length and complication of the instructions given to officers the needlessly large amount of writing and reporting required and the mechanical com pliance with rules and regulations demanded It is stated moreover that the required strict compliance with formal regulations leads to the employment of needless numbers of men and of superfluous locomotives cars and yard space all serving to swell operating expenses But more space is here given to the predominance of the Juristen in the higher ranks of the administration and to the undue subordination of the engineers The chief power and the best pay go to officials who enter the railway service by way of the law Next after them come the civil engineersif that term can be taken as an accurate translation of Bautechniker while at the bottom of the list are the mechanical engineers or Maschinentechniker The last named it is said are in fact the best equipped and most competent of all the three and should be given more rapid promotion and a larger share of the higher posts The author emphasizes this point when he sums up his opinions by way of conclusion in two proposi tions first that the unsatisfactory results achieved by the state railways are due to the sway of the lawyers whose practical knowledge and training are insufficient and second that high operating expenses and unsatisfactory safeguards against accidents indicate inefficiency in the operating depart ment again due to the failure to put in charge those who are best equipped The complaints of the rule of the lawyers and of the undue subordination of the engineers prominent in the pamphlet last cited appear again in the fourth pamphlet which though published at a considerably later date may be conveniently noticed here It is an answer to the quasi official utterance of Herr Ulrich presently to be described and gives attention mainly to the position salary and promo tion of the engineers These it is repeated should have a larger share in general administration and an injustice isRAIL WAY MANAGEMENT IN PRUSSIA said to be done them in the slowness of their promotion and the small number of higher positions open to them In some of the later comments on this particular item in the contro versy it was said that its author evidently himself an engineer gave evidence of nothing more than selfish complaint from dissatisfied engineers and deserved no serious attention as a critic of general conditions and certainly the questions of salary and promotion fill much space in his pages We may turn now to the second group and consider briefly the two anonymous pamphlets numbered 5 and 6 which profess to take an impartial position in the controversy While admitting the existence of some engineering and tech nical defects both of them give high praise in general to the administration of the state railways Both assert however that the training of the railway officials is unsatisfactory The engineers it is said have a too exclusively technical training and need a better equipment in matters of administration financial management and economics at large On the other hand those now active in general administration receive a training too exclusively legal not such as to prepare them for an understanding of the concrete questions presented to the railway administrator The path to preferment in the higher places of the railway service it is pointed out is to study law at the university take the assessor examination and then secure an assignment to railway service in other words to take the training traditional for those who wish to enter the inner circle of German bureaucracy Both writers seem to be of opinion that the general principle of this arrangement should be maintained the higher posts should be reserved in the future as in the past for those whose training has been for administration rather than in engineer ing and technology But they admit defects in the narrow training now secured by the Verwaltungsbeamten The friend of these officials indeed who writes the sixth pamphlet presents at the close of his contribution to the dis cussion a very elaborate scheme for a special course of training for railway officials in which the subjects semesters and oppor tunities for practical experience are planned with great detail 8182 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS In the third group of papers and articles by railway officials unquestionably the most important is the careful paper on Die A usbildlung der l h5heren Verwaltungsbeamten by Herr Franz Ulrich an important official in the alinistry of Public Works at Berlin well known as the author of perhaps the best book on railway rates This able and distinguished writer admits the existence of some evils He does not believe indeed that there is ground for deep dissatisfaction and lets it be distinctly understood that in his judgment the higher administrative officials are not to come from the ranks of the engineers or technical experts but to be promoted as in the past from the general candidates for places of distinction in the German bureaucracy The problems with which they have to deal are largely administrative industrial and finan cial for the solution of which the training of the engineers gives little aid But Ulrich admits freely that at present the education of the candidate for this sort of work is inadequate As a measure of immediate reform he proposes that the can didates who now prepare for railway service by studying law at the universities and then taking the assessor examinations shall be given some opportunity for practical experience when they first enter the service and shall have a later opportunity to attend regular lectures and systematic instruction in rail way matters He suggests also a more radical remedy an entire change in the training required of candidates for the railway service by diminishing their legal studies and requir ing greater attention to economics public administration and technical railway questions In fact the training of the rail way official should be a separate one as soon as he enters the university which is to provide a course of study for him as distinct from that of the lawyer as from that of the engineer So far as the engineers themselves are concerned Ulrich in timates that the real difficulty in their case is that there are too many of them the lower ranks of the profession being full and the number of higher places available for them neces sarily small Their promotion therefore is inevitably slow That they should ever have an important place not to say a commanding one in the general administration of the rail ways seems to him of more than doubtful expediencyRAIL IVAY IANAGEMENT IN PRUSSIA Much in the same vein is the discussion of the subject at the hands of another writer even better known to students of economics Professor Cohn of GSttingenwho reviews Ulrichs paper in the Archiv fuir Eisenbahnwesen This dis tinguished scholar points out that the controversy is not a new one The need of some separate training for administra tive officers has often been urged in times past and has be come more prominent now only because of the enormously greater importance of efficient public administration He intimates a doubt whether the initial training of the candi dates in the law should be done away The first two years of their university career can be advantageously given to legal studies if only for intellectual discipline and general ripening of judgment With the spirit of Ulrichs proposals he finds himself in hearty accord and so joins the ranks of those who would welcome some important change in the training of the candidates for administrative positions in the railway service A less cordial reception on the whole is given to the pro posals for innovation by the next two writers on our list both again railway officials now in service HIerr A v d Leyen known to American readers by his discussions of railway experiences in the United States and an official of position in the Prussian service intimates even more distinctly than his colleague Ulrich that the engineers are not to aspire to more and better places than they have had in the past and that the administration of the railways will always require a staff of officials whose training shall be predominantly legal and ad ministrative The explanation of the complaints made for the last few years he finds largely in the personal dissatis faction of certain engineers Some changes in the existing methods of training may be desirable but on the whole lit tle concession is here made to the remonstrants Even less concession is made by Herr Lentze in the articles cited from the Archiv fiur Eisenbahnwesen This official finds indeed that the Assessors are not always employed to best effect in the service as it now is being sometimes set to clerkwork which could be attended to by less highly trained persons 8384 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS But he believes that a thorough and prolonged legal training is needful for higher administrative work and that in this re gard things should remain much as they are Finally quite a different light is thrown on the situation by the article in the Jahrbuch fur GesetzgebuLng for October last Its writer Herr de Terra a railway Direktor at Frankfort agrees with Ulrich in believing that a training in the law does not constitute a satisfactory equipment for the duties of the higher administrative officers of the railways and while differing as to details admits that there should be a separate curriculum beginning at the outset of the university career for candidates looking to the railway service But more in teresting to the foreigner is his presentation of one peculiar cause of inefficiency and expense This he finds in the neces sity of finding employment in the service for military officers and particularly for noncommissioned officers who have served their term in the army and are to be provided for in later years by positions in the railways In order to make the position of noncommissioned officer in the army attrac tive it has been formally provided that they shall have a pref erential right to appointment in various positions on the rail ways Herr de Terra informs us that the work of these men is far from satisfactory their education is insufficient espe cially for responsible positions in larger stations and the fact that they are entitled by right to their places naturally does not render them more eager and active in service Their presence directly and indirectly causes operating expenses to be higher and entails a charge on the railway administration which should properly be set to the military account Even with this assurance of a certain livelihood in later years the noncommissioned officers attracted to military service are said to be of unsatisfactory quality the railways are burdened without the attainment of the desired military advantages The object of the preceding summaries has been mainly to present the pros and cons of the controversy to those students of railway economics who may not have had opportunity to follow it To pass judgment on it is impossible for one notRAIL WA Y MANAGEMENT IN PRUSSIA on the ground and not in close contact with current events The internal evidence is that some at least of the complaints are not without foundation It is true that their anonymous character all the pamphlets in the first and second groups are anonymous has been urged against them in some of the quasi official answers but this hardly deprives them of weight Place and promotion in the German bureaucracy depenl so largely on the good will of the administrative chiefs that a certain stifling of free criticism is inevitable among those en rolled in the service yet they alone are likely to have such an acquaintance with the details of management and operation as would make intelligent criticism possible The general impression left on the outsider is that there have been some engineering and mechanical mistakes in the Prussian administration But doubtless they have been exaggerated and doubtless it would be difficult to make out any clear connection between them and that predominance of the Jecristen from which they are alleged to spring Whether on the whole balancing successes and failures the mechanical operation of the Prussian railways has been faulty there is no satisfactory evidence in the material here under review To reach any helpful conclusion on such a point is at best almost impossible for a layman and in any case would involve a comparison not between methods in Germany on the one hand and England or the United States on the other but between Germany under public management and Germany under private management As to the training of administrative officers and especially of those who look forward to a share in the work of general management it has been admitted in almost all quarters that there is need for improvement So general was the agree ment on this point that a commission was appointed by the ministry to investigate the subject and prepare a scheme for the training of railway administrators But the commission has not reported and apparently is not likely to do so the whole matter seems to have been shelved The question evi dently has wider bearings than those connected with the rail way service alone It touches the unsettled educational prob 8586 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS lems as to the position of the classical gymnasium and of the humanistic training which is the main gate of entry to the bureaucracy and to those branches of public service having the greatest social prestige Herr de Terra in the article cited above has occasion to explain that the scheme of edu cation for railway officers which he proposes will not cause their position to have less of public esteem or of TVornehmheit  an explanation which of itself indicates how important a part this factor in the situation plays On one point there can be no reasonable doubt There has been an excess of red tape a multiplication of officers an un necessary quantity of writing and reporting in the railway administration of the last ten years So much may be gath ered with certainty from the fact that the ministry has pro posed a reorganization of the railway service described in the Denkschrift last enumerated in our list of publications by means of which the services of no less than eighteen hundred administrative officers will be dispensed with The defects of the past doubtless have been due largely to historical causes When the private railways were bought by the state their divisions and boundaries were naturally made the basis of the organization of the state railways As time has gone on and the system of pullic management has got into permanent working order the rearrangement in organization has become feasible and a scheme having this object in view was laid before the Landtag dluring the last spring Blut it may be fairly inferred that in addition to the defects due to the transition from private to public management some of the defects inevitable in public management even at its best have shown themselves A certain unwieldiness a mechanical insistence on obedience to rules and regulations a cumbrous system of checks and counterchecks an excess of formalism not least likely in a bureaucracy like that of Germany a lack of freedom and elasticitythese are the obvious drawbacks of public management and the indications are that they have shown themselves in Prussia All this however is not inconsistent with admitting that the system of public management in Prussia has been on theRAILWAY MANAGEMENT IN PRUSSIA 87 whole unmistakably successful Financially industrially and probably even in the details of administration the Prussians have reason to be proud of the results secured by their body of trained public servants The opponents of public manage ment in countries like England and the United States will doubtless be tempted to find in the current controversy evi dence in support of their assertions as to the general disadvan tages of state ownership But it is significant that even the severest critics in Germany never hint at such a thing as a return to the system of private ownership or suggest that the evils of the present regime outweigh its benefits If some mistakes have been made and if some of the defects inevitable in any system of public mIanagement have been encountered the general result has none the less been one in which the German people and German bureaucracy may take lpride F AV TvAssIG

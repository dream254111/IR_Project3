science reveals two diverse civilizations in that area during the early iron age separated probably rather by a few hundred years of time than by a few hundred miles of space The first is represented by the remarkable cemetery of Hall statt near Salzburg This locality discloses a people skilled in working bronze gold and iron manufacturers of richly decorated and gracefully formed pottery lovers of ornaments of amber glass and agate and accustomed to cremate their dead We may place them 500800 BC The late iron age is the La Tene period one or two centuries before the Christian era deriving its name from a station in western Switzerland By that time the working of iron had reached a singular perfection glass gold silver and precious stones were frequent the dead were buried in stone coffins and a local coinage was for the first time issued in metallic pieces now popularly known by the name  rainbowkeys Recent studies on this period are those of Dr Jakob Heierli of Zurich in the December number of the Proceedings of the Vienna Anthropological Society who describes a La Tene station in eastern Switzerland one by Dr L Niederle in the Report of the International Congress of PreHistory at Moscow discussing the age of iron in Bohemia and an address by Von Troltsch be fore the German Anthropological Society with reference to it in southern Germany Enigmatical Stone Implements In Science Jan 6 Mr Walter Hough describes a form of pol ished stone implement with grooved surfaces and suggests that these utensils were employed in beating out fibrous bark for clothing paper etc This suggestion is not improbable and has been accepted by some curators In the Trocadero Museum Paris these stones are labeled Armatures de maillet a battre les fibres dagave In the University Museum Philadelphia one bears the label  Pounder said to have been used in pounding the agave in making pulque There is no doubt of the correctness of this identification The Mexicans called these implements aamatequini paper beaters from the verb amauitequi Mr Hough is also right in surmising that the Mexican paper was not made from the agave alone Other materials were the bark of the Cardia a tree of the family Boraginaceae and palm leaves hojas de palma which Boturini says made the finest of all An article on the amatequini may be found in La Nature Dec 15 1888 Another strange implement or ornament is the stone yokes or collars which are found in eastern Mexico In the Internat Achiv fiur Ethnographie 1892 Dr Ernst of Caracas has an in teresting article on these He believes them to be memorial tokens of great individual achievements and worn as signs of power and dignity on certain ceremonial occasions Mr Strebel who wrote an article some years ago on the same subject enter tained a similar opinion As they are quite heavy often weigh ing about sixty pounds some have supposed they were intended to fasten the victim to the sacrificial stone the techcatl They are evidently not adapted for this however I would suggest that they were the stones used in the game of ball tlachtli de scribed by the early writers enclosing the aperture through which the ball was to be driven Some are closed with an armature one of which is figured by Dr Ernst They are to be distinguished from the stone yokes from Porto Rico Recent Researches in South American Ethnology South America offers as large an unexplored region as Africa and one with as promising possibilities Strange that it has not attracted more attention from adventurous travellers I One of these M Henri Coudreau has accomplished three expeditions at the instance of the French government into the far interior of Guiana His general results have appeared in various works as La France Equinoxiale  Chez Nos Indiens etc Lately his linguistic collections have been edited by the competent hand of M Lucien Adam in a volume forming Tome XV of the Biblio theque Linguistique Americaine published by Maisonneuve Paris NCE VOL XXI No 527 It contains ample and carefully prepared vocabularies of the Ouayana Aparai Oyampi and Emerillon dialects The first two are shown on abundant evidence to be niembers of the Carib stock while the two latter are Tupi dialects Ernesto Restrepo Tirado is a young and active archaeologist of the Republic of Colombia equally enthusiastic in fieldwork and in historical studies as is well shown in his Estudios sobre los Aborigenes de Colombia the first part of which a volume of 180 pages with a good map was published in Bogota last year It begins with an extraordinary list of the tribes who occupied the territory at the time of the conquest largely drawn from the epic of Juan de Castellanos That Mr Restrepo had the courage to read the 110000 verses which compose this epic is reason enough to entitle him to our profound respect Of course a great part of his study refers to the Chibchas who had the highest culture of any Colombian tribes They were however not the most skilful workers in gold This honor belonged to the Quimbayas upon whom he has written along essay separately published As their wealth led to their early and complete destruction by the Spaniards their ethnic affinity has not yet been determined The University of Zurich possesses the rare treasure of five skeletons of members of the Alakuluf tribe of Tierra del Fuego It seems these wretched islanders were taken to Europe to show in museums and by some strange fatality all died at Zurich of pneumonia Dr Rudolph Martin has worked up their osteology and published his results in the Vierteljahrsschrift der INatur Gesell in Zurich He finds the skulls well shaped rmesocephalic with relatively large cubical capacity 1590 cubic centimetres and the horizontal circumference greater than that of the modern Parisians as reported by Broca The torsion of the humerus was less than in Europeans and two of the humeri showed perforation of the fossa of the olecranon The study is an exact and an in teresting one LETTERS TO THE EDITOR  Correspondents are requested to be as brief as possible The writers name is in all cases required as proof of good faith On request in advance one hundred copies of the number containing his communication will be furnished free to any correspondent The editor will be glad to publish any queries consonant with the character of the journal A Reply to Professor Hathaway I HAVE just read the note of praise and criticism on my books by Professor Hathaway in Science of Feb 17 Kindly allow me a few words in the way of reply Passing over the first part of his note and thanking him for any praise of my books which he has given them I come to what he calls his  illustration of my treatment and use of the method of infinitesimals He says  Thus by trigonometry sin x  dx  cos x  dx  sin x V 2 cos 4  dx  cos x cos dx  cos x sin dx  sin x  cos x  cos x dx since 2 cos d 1 cos dx  1 sin dx  dx Hence d sin x  cos x cos x dx a false result Of course it is a I false result who would expect anything else when the work in it is false  But this is Professor Hatha ways work not mine His statement made above that Vf 2 cos 4i  dx  1 is not true For V 2 cos  dx 1  dx as any mathematician can see Therefore d sin x  cos x  cos x dx  sin x dx a true result Professor Hathaway has given the above illustration as hesays to show how I establish the differentials of the trigonometric functions  though I should have never known it if he hadnt told me and I deny that I should ever have taken this roundabout way I hope that Professor Hathaway will not give the credit of his false result to the infinitesimal method which he says 4 is at best a dangerous one even in the hands of the masters let alone the average student I think on the contrary that the method is a safe one when well understood  In the handsSCIENCE of the average student any method is dangerous In view of Professor Hathaways illustration I do not feel called upon yet to revise my eulogy on infinitesimals E A BOWSER Rutgers College New Brunswick N J Mar 2 A Question of Evidence IN a recent number of Science I ventured to express the hope that a new era was dawning in American archeeologic science and that the department of geologic archbeology especially would experience a needed renaissance I laid particular stress upon the deceptive and meagre nature of the evidence already on record and ventured to point out the demands of the future with respect to certain lines of research Some of my statements relating to the character of the evidence have given rise to sharp comment on the part of defenders of the paleolithic theory I strongly deprecate personalities in scientific discussion and hesitate to refer in a critical way to the legitimate work of other investigators desiring to restrict m Nself to such criticism as is absolutely necessary for sifting the evidence and getting at the truth but the generalized statements by means of which I at tempted to describe the old archaeology are not sufficiently tren chant to he effective more definite and detailed characterization mustitseems be given This can best be accomplished by means of illustrations drawn from the writings of those defenders of the faith who make most vociferous claim to superiority of knowl edge and profundity of research Numerous illustrations are at hand but I will refer only to the work of those who have unfairly reviewed or offensively referred to the positions taken by me Attention has been called in Professor Wrights work The Ice Age to a number of papers bearing on the paleolithic question written by Mr H W Haynes of Boston In these papers twelve in number I have carefully sought references to original observa tions on the glacial arbchaeology of this country and find to my surprise that they are limited to two lines and a quarter of text These lines include also reference to the discoveries of Professor Wright Dr Abbott and two others present on the occasion The record reads as follows  Several implements were taken by the others either from the gravel or the talus on the river bank in my presence and I found five myself 1 The italics are my own and call attention to essential features of the finds and to the fact that Mr Hayness investigations are expressed in five words quite sufficient no doubt for the presentation of the matter since the articles found were probably all modern pieces from the talus Now any one could find these objects in the talus at that day and no one now attaches any value to such finds save three or four advocates of the paleolithic theory in America who hesitate to acknowledge or fail to see the shortcomings of their early work The chances are a hundred to one that all talus finds and all the finds made by Mr Haynes are Indian shoprejects left by native workmen who utilized the argillite bowlders and masses that out cropped in the face of the bluff But whether they were from the talus or not I would call attention to the fact that the lan guage used by Mr Haynes in describing the discoveries indicates practical  ignorance  of the only essential points of the discus sion of fossil man In the first place had he known that the things he picked up either from the gravel or the talus as he states it correspond exactly with the ordinary modern quarry and shoprejects of the Trenton region he would certainly not have ventured to class them with European paleolithic imple ments and to build a monument to American antiquity and to himself upon them and in the second place had he known that the only legitimate proof of the antiquity of such specimens in America is geologic proof he would not have failed to properly discriminate between those articles obtained from the gravels in place  if there were such  and those obtained from the talus From his language it is evident that at that time he had no com prehension of the real problems involved and could not have ap preciated the necessity of the discriminating observation now con sidered essential by scientific men consequently his observations made in archmeologic obscurity and geologic darkness amount to naught and no subsequent patchingup can redeem them 1 Haynes H W Proc Boston Soc Nat Hist Vol XXI p 132 I35 Professor Wright who is vigorously championed by Mr Haynes does not claim to have found any relic of art in the gravels and hence probably knows nothing from his own observation favoring the glacial age of man in America and I was led in a review of portions of his published work to question his judgment in writing so much on the finds of others and accepting all statements that came to hand without apparent attempt at discrimination Mr Haynes has been more successful in his finds having added five unverified turtlebacks to the long list of paleolithic strays He may not have broken Professor Wrights record in number of papers published but he has been less discriminatingin the use of unsound data Having little knowledge of native art and less of geology he has rarely touched the subject of glacial man without adding to its obscurity His most pronounced shortcoming is however in the line of original research when the three lines recording his complete achievements in the American field are cut down to five words as quoted above and these words reduced to their real bearing upon the question of glacial man in America we have only the punctuation left It would be difficult to find within the whole range of scientific writing three lines containing less of science or evincing a greater degree of incompetence to treat of the subject discussed than these Another example of  that half wisdom half experience gives may be cited In a recent publication Mr Haynes avers that I have rashly and wrongly characterized the work of other investi gators yet a hurried glance into his part of that work convinces me not only that I shall be acquitted of this charge but that I may now safely venture farther I am constrained therefore to suggest that perhaps Mr Hayness investigations of paleolithic man in Egyptin the only field in which he can possibly lay claim to having added a single new fact of importance to the data of archeologic science will not require more than five words for their proper record A brief summary of these researches may be given Scattered over the surface of the ground in the valley of the Nile he found several implements of supposed St Acheul type and numerous examples of other flaked objects of ordinary and extraordinary shapes We learn however in his own words that t Quaternary deposits do not occur in the Nile valley so far as I am aware though they have been found in various parts of the Sahara i The  implements of St Acheul type are assumed to be paleo lithic because of their looks This is the evidence  of the ordi nary paleolith hunter and it does not appear of the least conse quence to him that the quaternary deposits which alone could furnish the only real element of proof of antiquity  the geologic element  are not found in the Nile valley at all but are said to exist somewhere in Sahara These enormous leaps from meagre data to fullblown conclusions are characteristic of the past archae ology and awaken feelings of amazement in the minds of practi cal students today Even if analogies of form in implements are allowed to have a definite value in cultural or chronologic correla tions in Europe and adjoining lands it must be insisted that in America until types of flaked objects other than those found commonly in Indian shoprefuse heaps are established the test of antiquity shall be a geologic test The two illustrations given serve to indicate my reasons for raising the question of competency with respect to the evidence relied upon to establish a paleolithic glacial man in America Observations of the class cited howsoever greatly multiplied can never amount to proof demonstrating rather the lack of it My position with respect to this point need not be misunderstood when a single artificial object is found that can be fully and satisfactorily verified geologically I shall gladly join hands with other students in making it a nucleus about which to arrange all that are clearly fellows with it Then and not till then will uncertainty become certainty and not till then can the question of the grade of glacial art be taken up and profitably studied I only ask that the evidence relating to glacial man be properly scrutinized and that meanwhile paleolithic man in America shall bide his time 2 Haynes H W  The Fossil Man Popular Science Monthly Vol XVII p 358 MARCH IO I893

SETTLEMENT NEW YORK More than a quarter of a century has elapsed since a letter written by a passenger on an English railway train as he sat on the bank beside the track waiting for a brokendown engine to be repaired resulted in the founding of the first Social Settle ment The writer was the Reverend Canon Samuel A Barnett then Vicar of St Judes Church Whitechapel in East London and the settlement was Toynbee Hall Mrs Barnett has re cently published an interesting account of the steps that led to the realization of the settlement idea She describes the lack of knowledge of the poor on the part of earnest thinking men when she and her husband took up their work at St Judes and tells of the visits they made to Oxford from time to time to talk to little groups of cultivated serious young college men to get them to care about the poor and their problems Some of these men came to Whitechapel for a visit to see for themselves the condi tions of poverty and occasionally some would take lodgings in East London when they left the university to begin their life work In this way a connection was established between White chapel and the university and discerning spirits were able to see that each side had contributions of value to make to the other It was not strange that when Mr Barnett was asked to give advice to some men at St Johns College Cambridge who were desirous of doing something for the poor and were not quite prepared to start a college mission he should have suggested that men might hire a house where they could come for short or long periods and living in an industrial quarter learn to sup sorrow with the poor This suggestion was made in the letter to which I have referred and that letter says Mrs Barnett founded Toynbee Hall The letter was expanded into a paper read in48 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW November of the same year 1883 at a college meeting at St Johns College Oxford The idea was taken up with enthusiasm and on Christmas Eve 1884 the first settlers took up their resi dence in the new building which had been erected adjacent to St Judes Church The story of the naming of the new enterprise as Mrs Barnett tells it is interesting Arnold Toynbee a rare spirit was one of the group of young men at Oxford who had been deeply interested in the welfare of the poor An intimate friend of the Barnetts he had been a frequent visitor at St Judes vicar age and for a brief period had lived in lodgings in East London But his health never vigorous soon gave way and he was removed by an untimely death Mrs Barnett writes The 10th of March was a Sunday and on the afternoon of that day Balliol chapel was filled with a splendid body of men who had come together from all parts of England in loving memory of Arnold Toynbee on the anniversary of his death Dr Jowett had asked my husband to preach to them and they listened separating almost silently at the chapel porch filled one could almost feel by the aspiration to copy him in caring much if not doing much for those who had fallen by the way or were ignorant of our glorious gains We had often chatted those of us who were busy planning the new Settlement as to what to call it We did not mean the name to be descriptive it should we thought be free from every possible savor of a Mission and yet it should in itself be suggestive of a noble aim As I sat on that Sunday afternoon in the chapel one of the few women among the crowd of strongbrained cleanliving men assembled in reverent affection for one man the thought flashed to me Let us call the Settlement Toynbee Hall To Mr Bolton King the honorary secretary of the committee had come the same idea and it finding favor with the committee was so decided and our new Settlement received its name before a brick was laid or the plans concluded It was two years later that the Neighborhood Guild which subsequently became the University Settlement was founded in New York From these beginnings the movement has spread until in this country alone are now counted some five hundred social settlements If the name is often loosely used imply ing a somewhat vague conception of the essential idea it has ceased to be an unfamiliar term Indeed settlement work is used by many persons as a generic expression to denote such acTHE SOCIAL SETTLEMENT 49 tivities as are usually associated with a settlementthe clubs classes and social gatherings that are so much in evidence in most settlements All this means that the social settlement has gained a certain vogue It has become a popular method of modern philanthropy It has reached a wellestablished place in social amelioration and reform If the name is claimed by organizations which miss the essence of the thing this in itself is an evidence of the settle ments popularity Time was in the early days of the settlement when its friends felt obliged to ask that for a while judgment be suspended The idea was too new perhaps by reason of its breadth it appeared too vague Just because the settlement was designed to touch life at every point to include within its view the whole range of human interests and needs it was not easy to give a concrete and specific statement of its aims and purposes such as would be entirely satisfactory to that somewhat overrated individual the practical man Still the practical man has his rights The settle ment can no longer ask exemption from criticism on the ground of its experimental character In this age of efficiency tests applied not only in the field of industrial and commercial en terprise but also in that of education and charitable effort the settlement cannot hope to escape Nor do its friends desire that it should be exempt from the necessity of rendering an ac count They believe that it has fulfilled a useful function in the community and they are not prepared to agree with those of their critics who while they admit the value of the work accomplished maintain that the method has about reached the limit of its pos sibilities as a factor in social progress It is a fair question to raisethis question as to the relatively permanent value of the social settlement When a certain settlement was closed last winter in New York the impression got abroad that the House was no longer of vital necessity to the neighborhood owing to the extension of social opportunities by the municipality a condition which was generally supposed to be attributable to the influence of the settlement As a matter of fact this view of the case was erroneous but such a situation is quite conceivably possible There is an aspect of the settlement in which its very success in50 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW bringing about a variety of needed local reforms such as the socialization of the public schools the extension of playgrounds and the like might be supposed to put it out of business much as a physician might seem to terminate his usefulness by the success with which he pursued preventive medicine and social hygiene Hence it is high time to inquire what the settlement has accomplished and what promise for the future the method possesses The question is sometimes asked how far the settlement has fulfilled the hopes of those who took the lead in the early days It would be interesting to ascertain what the founders of the work had in mind and to determine how far their expectations have been realized Thus for example Canon Barnett declared long ago that the aim of the residents of Toynbee Hall was first to form friendships and then through friendship to raise the stand ard of living and of life Professor Graham Taylor tells us that the purpose of the founders was to democratize culture and to humanize city politics Writing while the settlement was still young of the subjective pressure towards social settlements Miss Jane Addams distinguished a threefold motive namely the desire to make the entire social organism democratic to extend democracy beyond its political expression then the impulse to share the race life in order to bring social energy and the accumulation of civilization to those portions of the race that have little and finally a feeling that springs from a cer tain renaissance of Christianity especially in its early humani tarian aspects The object of HullHouse is described as being to provide a centre of a higher civic and social life to institute and maintain educational and philanthropic enterprises and to investigate and improve the conditions in the industrial districts of Chicago Somewhat differently phrased is this statement from Chicago Commons We who are at Chicago Commons to share the common lot choose to live for our own and others sake where we seem to be most needed rather than where the neighborhood is supposed to offer the most of social privilege and prestige    We assume the full obligations and claim all the rights of citizenship in a community with whose interests we iden tify ourselves whose conditions we share and for whose homeTHE SOCIAL SETTLEMENT 51 happiness material welfare political freedom and social privilege and progress we try to do our part It will be noted that all of these statements of purpose are concerned not with definite and concrete details but rather with certain broad principles of good citizenship and neighborly ser vice I think it may be said that the early leaders in the move ment did not aim at accomplishing this and that definite object so much as at the expression in the midst of the life about them of which they had voluntarily made themselves a part of the spirit of neighborliness They were thoroughgoing demo crats who sought to make the privileges of the few the oppor tunities of all They set about their task in the scientific spirit seeking to know the facts of the situation with which they were dealing and they brought to it the desire to serve by sharing This has been perhaps one of the distinctive contributions which the settlement has made to the work of social reformthis com bination of the scientific spirit with the humanitarian It is probable that those who struck out on this untrodden way would not have ventured to predict whither it would lead them but the prospects must have been alluring Unforeseen opportuni ties and possibilities were constantly unfolding to the view and now as one looks back over the years it is not difficult to see some marks of progress toward the goal of democracy Just what value to assign to the settlement in the process just how much to claim for it in reviewing the progress that has already been made is more difficult but that it has played an important part no one who is familiar with the movement can doubt Before we attempt to indicate what the settlement has accom plished and to estimate the value of the idea it will be worth while to clear the air of certain misconceptions It is somewhat surprising to find how general at this late day is the confusion of mind regarding the method and the aim of the social settlement There are for example those who confound it with mission work as if it were some new form of religious propagandism others think of it as some fresh departure in organized charity and still others conceive of it as chiefly concerned with educa tional effort Such misunderstanding is after all not so much to be wondered at Just because the settlement sought to touch52 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW life on every side it laid itself open to misunderstanding on the part of the casual observer And most people moreover are slow to grasp a new idea They can think of it only in terms of something they already understand and in association with some institution to which the new idea appears in some way related And those who confounded the social settlement with enterprises of education or undertakings of religion or organized charity were not altogether at fault For the settlement has been brought of necessity into intimate relations with these and other phases of work Settlement workers have always been vitally interested in ques tions of education and nearly every settlement has some educa tional features among its activities such as a kindergarten or library or classes in manual training and household economics But in nearly all cases these features will be found to have been introduced either as supplementary to the educational facilities of the public schools or as experiments whose value must be demonstrated before Boards of Education can be asked to incor porate them in the publicschool system There may also be instances in which sewing or cooking or carpentry is taught either as a means of bringing a personal influence to bear upon the characters of the children or of getting in touch with certain elements of the neighborhood But the settlement does not exist primarily to do a work of education Such educational features as settlements may have included in their programmes are in a sense accidents of the work And yet the subject of public education is very close to the heart of every settlement resident All his experience goes to convince him that the field of education must be broadened and socialized and that whatever of educational opportunity society owes to the individual must be paid for by the people as a whole Some of the most notable work of the settlements has been accom plished in connection with the public schools but of this I shall speak later If it is a mistake to think of the social settlement as an educa tional institution it is still farther from the truth to consider it simply as a fresh departure in charitable work This is not to say that there are not many cases where the lines of settlementTHE SOCIAL SETTLEMENT 53 work and interest run parallel to those of organized charity If for example organized charity is everywhere throwing the empha sis on the importance of preventive work in dealing with the social problem the settlement is in full agreement and hopes no less ardently than organized charity to see the day when poverty shall be abolished and to have some part in bringing that happy day to pass But the settlement is not dealing primarily or as an essential part of its work with the dependent class It is simply a neighbor among neighbors And just as one neighbor lends a helping hand to another neighbor in distress so the settlement tries to bring the needed help to those of its neighbors whose lines have fallen in grievous places This may mean giving tem porary material relief It will more likely mean putting the un fortunate individual or family in touch with the appropriate agency of organized charity No settlement would wish to acquire the reputation of being a centre for the administration of material relief It is true that the modern charityorganization society includes among its functions many things beside the administra tion of relief The field of charity has expanded with the expan sion of social vision and the deepening of the sense of social respon sibility And if thus both in interest and in method charity and the social settlement have drawn closer together the enthusiastic advocate of settlement work might claim with some show of reason that the situation was in a considerable degree due to the reaction of the spirit of the settlement upon the work of charity Doubtless a more temperate statement of the case would be that the settlement is itself one expression of the new social spirit which has profoundly influenced all philanthropic effort There is perhaps no more serious blunder concerning the social settlement than that which confounds it with the mission For there are those even today who conceive of settlement work as only another name for mission worknot to be sure the oldtime sort of mission work but none the less an effort through the preaching of a gospel to save individual souls Now there is a sense in which the settlement idea grew out of the mission idea I do not mean simply that there is a deep religious motive whether it be consciously acknowledged or not underlying the settlement What I have in mind is the fact that when Canon Barnett first54 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW proposed the establishment of a social settlement he took occasion to point out the shortcomings of the then popular college mis sions centres of religious work in the crowded sections of London supported by university men and suggested that university set tlements would better express the idea that these missions sought to realize But those who think of the settlement as a centre of religious propagandism might defend their attitude by citing the fact that not a few settlements are carrying on some sort of defi nite religious activity A recent study of Religious Work in the Settlements of the Borough of Manhattan New York City covering twentyseven houses showed that eleven were maintain ing some form of religious work Nine of these were Protestant in their connections one Roman Catholic and one Hebrew There are of course other organizations directly connected with churches and known as church settlements but of these the study above referred to took no account Now it might be maintained that the settlements which are conducting religious work are very far removed from the traditional mission both in method and spirit In most cases this would be true But in my judgment it is far better for the settlement to leave distinctively religious work to the church and confine itself to the kind of neighborhood work which it is especially fitted to do and which no other organi zation yet devised is so well adapted to accomplish Those settle ments which on the whole have exerted the widest influence have followed this plan not because of any inherent hostility to organ ized religion but because it seemed the wisest course And I am convinced that their policy has proved itself thoroughly sound Any other course must tend to confusion To mix religious activi ties with the work of a settlement is to run a serious risk of imper illing some of the settlements most important interests And it is difficult to see what can be gained by such a course which could not be better accomplished by a church or mission with a thor oughly socialized ministry I think I can make clear what I mean by calling attention to two aspects in which the functions of the church or mission and the settlement are differentiated These points of difference concern first the approach to the neighborhood and secondly the contacts with the neighborhood The mission is established in a given locality for the purposeTHE SOCIAL SETTLEMENT 55 of declaring a messagea gospel that is well developed and clearly defined It has a distinct work of propaganda and it seeks to persuade men to accept its message and act upon it It knows at the outset exactly what it proposes to do for it deals primarily with wellascertained human needs which it believes to be universal In this respect the mission differs radically from the settlement which does not approach its neighborhood with preconceived notions as to what must be done for the neighborhoods regen eration It has no definite propaganda no clearcut social theory to apply It conceives its first duty to be to make the acquaint ance of its neighbors to study its field with a view to knowing the conditions under which the men and the women and the chil dren are living and working Policies remedies gospels must come later and only as a result of this knowledge And further more its method of work is not so much through the preaching of any gospel as through the organization of its neighborhood of all the local forces for good in some cooperative programme for the common welfare The other aspect in which the mission and the settlement differ is found in the character of the neighborhood contacts of the two institutions This is an important difference to bear in mind Obvious as it seems it is often overlooked If a church or mission be located in a given neighborhood and the people invited by the most cordial methods to come and adopt the view of truth con tained in its doctrinal standards and denominational platform it requires little experience to forecast the result One may be sure that the appeal of the mission however broad and genuine will be effective only with a certain class of the people of the neigh borhood Those who like the particular sort of thing for which this particular ecclesiastical organization stands will gather to its support while whole sections of the neighborhood will stand entirely aloof It will be a case of natural selection If the mis sion is supported by Protestant interests it will be vain to ex pect to attract Jews and Catholics if it is a Catholic organiza tion nothing can be hoped for from the Jews and Protestants and if the Jews are the promoters Protestants and Catholics will leave it severely alone This situation is as deplorable as it is56 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW real In the crowded sections of our cities and amongst our immigrant populations serious problems growing out of the very general indifference to religion press for solution Materialism in many forms presents itself and the feeble efforts of religious bodies to cope with the tremendous need are pitiable The situation possesses elements of tragedy One may discern hopeful signs of a growing tolerance in the representatives of the three great religious bodies of the western world but as with neighboring nations between which exists an entente cordiale let one overstep the boundaries of the other or let any conflict of interests arise and cordial relations are abruptly terminated In spite of the broadminded attitude of many religious leaders of different faiths and in spite of the greater tolerance of the present day we have not yet reached the point where all religious men regardless of creed can readily cooperate for the material and spiritual good of all As long as this continues to be the case no church of any faith can hope to make really broad contacts with a neighborhood whose religious and social interests are varied With the settlement however the case is quite different The very first duty of the settlement is to get as far as possible into neighborly relations with every element of the surrounding life Race religion social conditions and class feeling need present no barriers to friendly intercourse between people who live on the same block or in the same district And the settlement resi dent is not satisfied to let such barriers exist between himself and his neighbors He meets the people among whom he lives not on a professional basis but on the basis of neighborliness on the broad basis of a common humanity And I think it may be said that other things being equal a settlement is successful just in so far as it comes into effective relations with Jews and Catholics and Protestants the political leaders the city officials the organized workingmen the socialist group and all other groups that affect the social life of the neighborhood This is the ideal the settlement holds before it and it is an ideal that some settle ments have realized to a considerable degree And there is a distinct value in this when so many influences in our modern life are making for division into social groups and tending only to accentuate class consciousness The settlement stands priTHE SOCIAL SETTLEMENT 57 marily for those influences that unite and that tend to promote social consciousness From what has been said regarding the relation of the settle ment to other social activities it will I think be obvious that the social settlement worker has come to know the life of industrial neighborhoods from a new point of view Others have labored in the same field The teacher the charity worker the mission worker the student seeking data for some task of social research each may claim to be familiar with the neighborhood but the knowledge of each will almost inevitably be limited and qualified by his special interest The settlement worker has in a true sense no special interest He is interested in everything that has any human bearing upon his neighbors He has no special end to serve beyond the simple end of getting acquainted knowing facts about the struggles the difficulties the aspirations of his neigh bors and the conditions under which their work is done and their lives are lived Just because the settlement worker does not profess anything he escapes the narrowing influence of the professional point of view and is not met by that defensive atti tude on the part of his neighbors which the visit of the professional worker calls out When the minister calls unexpectedly the chances are that the mother of the family will hastily throw her apron over the can of beer that stands on the table when the settlement resident calls the chances are that he will be cordially invited to share the contents of the can This may shock the nerves of the reader but one comes to feel on reflection that there is an immense advantage in this frank and open relation ship This knowledge of things as they are of life as it is among that class of the community upon which the burdens of poverty rest this firsthand knowledge of conditions through living in close contact with the conditions is the settlements peculiar treasure That such knowledge could be had by living in neigh borly relations with people and that it was worth having was the settlements discovery a simple and obvious thing as it now seems and yet a discovery that has modified all social work and supplied a necessary corrective to much scientific social inquiry As we come now to discuss certain elements of value in the58 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW settlement method the influence of this knowledge of conditions through acquaintance with ones neighbors will reveal itself For example it fits the settlement to interpret the life of industrial neighborhoods In a democracy nothing but harm can result from a failure to understand and appreciate the conditions under which different sections of the community live and work and the ideals and aspirations which govern them Progress rests upon intelligent public opinion and this is the result of mutual under standing How little the people of some social groups know of the life of those of other groups Here for instance is a vast number of immigrants herded to gether in a corner of a great city alien in race in language in customs yonder is a great group of workingmen strongly or ganized and striving for justice in industrial conditions here again is an active body of earnest men laboring with whole souled devotion to reorganize society and place it upon a so cialistic basis and besides all these are the multitudes of people of moderate means and the smaller number of the rich most of whom fancy when they give the matter any thought that so long as they are comfortable the rest of the world must be except of course the shiftless and criminal who deserve their lot With our population sharply divided into such groups as these each with little vital contact with the other there is abundant opportunity of misunderstanding and prejudice which unfortu nately are all too common Perhaps still more unfortunate is the dense ignorance of one group concerning the most impor tant interests of the other Much social injustice is due to lack of knowledge With persons of intelligence and sympathy to know is commonly to act If for example women generally knew from frequent and neighborly observation the burden of sweated labor under which multitudes of their sisters suffer that the bargain counters may be heaped high the work of the Con sumers League would be considerably simplified Indeed hardly anything seems of more importance just now than that a better and more sympathetic understanding of each others point of view should exist between the widely separated groups of society If there had been such an understanding on the part of the ministers association of Bethlehem Pa and theTHE SOCIAL SETTLEMENT 59 striking steel workers the ministers would not have put this question to the strikers Is it reasonable to expect that by at tacking your employer openly and in secret by trying to destroy his property and his business you can best persuade him to deal generously and magnanimously with you Nor would it have been necessary for the committee appointed by the Commission on the Church and Social Service to use such language concern ing this question as the following There is evidence that the ministers were sincerely desirous to serve the best interest of the workmen including the strikers but the question addressed to them and quoted above is proof positive that they were too far aloof from the workingman to understand him and to win his confidence Nothing could be more exasperating to the work ingman than to assume that he desires to persuade his employer to deal generously and magnanimously with him What he desires and demands is not generosity and magnanimity at the hands of his employer but simple justice Not until ministers get close enough to the workingman to gain his point of view can they hope to influence him to any extent It is safe to assume that none of these Bethlehem ministers had ever enjoyed the privi lege of settlement residence For the settlement resident if he has eyes to see and ears to hear gets the point of view of the labor man and would never have committed such a blunder It is just here that the settlements have rendered an important service They have not only acquired knowledge of the condi tions under which their neighbors live and labor but they have been a medium through which this knowledge has been spread abroad The knowledge which the residents of settlements have gained has been based upon concrete instances of injustice and suffering and need on the part of their neighbors and friends And the knowledge thus gained has been used to mould public opinion and to create a background for intelligent efforts for reform This function of the settlement as an interpreter of the life of the crowded sections of our cities has received its finest expression in the genius of Jane Addams It would be hard to overestimate the value of such work as she has done through her writings and addresses Nothing could be finer than her book The Spirit of Youth and the City Streets as an interpretation of the60 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW environment of the city youth and as an appeal for a more in telligent handling of the question of public recreation It needs of course something more than settlement residence to qualify one to render such service but there are few seasoned settle ment residents who have not in some degree done a similar ser vice They have made valuable contributions to the work of social interpretation through reports and published studies as members of or witnesses before official commissions and as advocates of social legislation before legislative bodies It is perhaps in relation to our immigrant populations that the settlements have been most effective in the exercise of this func tion of interpretation Some of our most difficult social ques tions grow out of the presence of the multitudes of immigrants who crowd into the already congested sections of our cities throng the ranks of unskilled labor and bring with them habits and cus toms of primitive rural life which are illsuited to city dwelling Their presence complicates the problems of sanitation of housing and of industry And yet there are contributions of value which every immigrant race and nationality is capable of making to the sum total of our composite American character If on the one hand we are to profit by these contributions some group of people must have the insight to recognize such elements of value and the skill to draw them forth and preserve them And if on the other hand we are to give to the newcomers something more than material goods something of the best of the spirit of our traditions and institutions some group of people must make it its business to see that this is done with tact and sympathy and judgment To many of our foreignborn neighbors the nightstick of the policeman is the sceptre of authority in America and the first contact with our civic institutions which makes a lasting impression on him is often effected by a liberal application of that same sceptre followed by an arraignment in the policecourt The public schools are doing an important work in americanizing the children of the immigrants but what of the adult Shall we leave his education in civic and moral ideals to the tender mercies of the politician and the saloonkeeper These men take a very practical interest in him and have a corresponding influTHE SOCIAL SETTLEMENT 61 ence over him Through the joint good offices of these worthy citizens the Italian laborer gets a jobwhen he is able to pay for the privilege and the politician obligingly puts him in the way of getting naturalized indeed he is always ready to be his friend if always with the expectation of some suitable quid pro quo I recall the significant inquiry with which a young man was met who was endeavoring to organize a class of Italians for the study of English in a New York settlement As he went from store to store where the men congregated in the evening giving his invitation he was more than once asked Are you from Tam many When he disclaimed any connection with that organi zation they shrugged their shoulders and turned away Appar ently they could not conceive of any other organization or group of citizens taking an interest in their welfare It was an unin tentional rebuke to the settlement which was not lost upon it The settlement worker who is thoroughly at home among his Italian neighbors has an unusual chance to serve both his neigh borhood and the community at large Through a dozen natural channels he comes into friendly contact with his neighbors and with sympathetic understanding helps them to adjust themselves to the new and strange environment and through his contacts with the larger world outside of the Little Italy or the Ghetto the settlement resident has a chance to correct mistaken impressions and to dispel unfounded prejudices concerning the people among whom he dwells Another useful purpose that the social settlements have served has been as initiators of movements for social advance and as experiment stations where new proposals for community welfare could be tried out I know of no other organization which is quite so well fitted by its very nature to perform the service of interpretation And naturally growing out of this is the effort to meet the needs that are discovered In this latter particular the field is less peculiarly the settle ments Other organizations have had a large part in the work of social progress but the settlement has done its share Within recent years large foundations have been established for the purpose of initiating and furthering movements for commu nity welfare Before these great gifts were made leaders in62 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW charitable and correctional activities were demonstrating the pos sibilities of preventive work and setting on foot new enterprises of philanthropy And it is not too much to claim that the social settlement was a potent influence back of much of these more modern efforts Not that the settlement undertook at the out set to accomplish any definite reform It set itself to get ac quainted with people And this simple undertaking produced results which could not possibly have been foreseen That some thing must happen as a consequence of knowing ones neighbors the early leaders felt assured but just what that something would prove to be the most sanguine of them would scarcely have ventured to predict even though they cherished their dreams of what it might be One thing that followed was the influence on all enterprises of philanthropy and religion coming from the settlement method of learning to know peoples needs by sharing their experiences of life and using this knowledge as the basis of reform and preventive work Another thing was the necessity which at times the settlements themselves felt of initiat ing reform and preventive work and of using their facilities for testing the worth of new propositions A concrete case of indi vidual need comes to the attention of a settlement resident and in the attempt to meet the need it is seen to be only a symptom of a larger social need Then follows an effort to meet the larger need and the settlement is the natural place for the effort to be tried out It is in this way that settlements have become experi mentstations in social work Examples may be cited in the field of public health education and recreation The settlements intimate relation to the homes of the neigh borhood has naturally given it a deep though by no means ex clusive interest in the problems of childwelfare Many of the efforts of residents are directed toward securing for the children of the tenements such opportunities for development physical mental and moral as intelligent parents of ampler means consider essential for their children Questions of health naturally come in for a large share of attention where so many influences are at work to retard sound development What for example was more natural than for Miss Wald of the Henry Street Nurses Settle ment in New York with her professional training and intimateTHE SOCIAL SETTLEMENT 63 knowledge of the homes of her neighborhood to see how much could be accomplished by having a trained nurse cooperate with the doctor who was assigned to inspect the children in the public schools The next step was to try out the plan with the consent of the public authorities in the neighborhood of the settlement using the settlement nurses for the experiment The nurse could give general supervision to the cleanliness of the children call the attention of the doctor to cases of special need and follow up in the home or the dispensary any prescribed treatment After a little experimental work the value of the plan is determined and we have our staff of schoolnurses working under the Board of Health later merged as a further development of the idea into the Division of Child Hygiene of the Department of Health Kindergartens and free libraries commonly found a home in the settlements before the community was ready to support them out of public funds When the public was convinced of their value by practical tests they were largely transferred to public administration and support Much of the process of socialization which the public schools have undergone with such beneficent results has been initiated by the settlements Experiments in home and school visiting were being made in the settlements in the ordinary course of the days work long before any one realized that there was enough value in the scheme to organize it and put a tag on it and develop it into a distinct department of social activity The first boys club in a public school in New York was organized by a worker in the University Settlement who had successfully developed the club work of the settlement boys This may be regarded as the entering wedge in the use of schoolbuildings as recreation centres The whole question of public recreation is one which has always come to the front in settlement experience The organization of leisure is a familiar phrase in descriptions of settlement pur pose Not only do many persons need help in utilizing their spare time in a way to minister health to the body and refreshment to the spirit but also the opportunity for safe and wholesome recreation must often be created At present the needs of the community in the matter of recreation are left largely to the64 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW exploitation of those who see in them simply an opportunity of commercial gain Towards many of these enterprises of private business the attitude of the municipal authorities has almost always been repressive and rightly so But the community has offered little to meet in a wholesome way the legitimate public need which the cheap theatre the uncensored motionpicture show the dance hall and the like are meeting for pecuniary profit and at a frightful cost in human character It has remained for the social worker to recognize the immense importance of sane wholesome recreation as a powerful character builder and to move for larger municipal provision for this need of the citydweller The playground has always been a cherished object with the settlement resident and scarcely a settlement can be found in a crowded district which will not have converted its little twobyfour back yard into a pathetic apology for a play ground In the early days of the movement for playgrounds the settlement people were among the most ardent advocates and the most active workers And it is with no small satisfaction that social workers in New York reflect that the present Commissioner of Parks for the Boroughs of Manhattan and Richmond was an old settlement resident and for years has been the foremost pro moter of playgrounds in the city But I have said enough to indicate how the settlements have acted as initiators of movements and served as centres for social experimentation Such things as I have mentioned and others similar to them have been accomplished sometimes under the lead of the settle ments and more frequently in cooperation with other groups of social workers because there were persons of intelligence sym pathy and some leisure living among the people sharing their experiences studying the neighborhood needs and finding out what ought to be done Other uses of the settlement might be mentioned One is tempted to speak of its gettogether character to point out the service it has done in bringing together on neutral ground repre sentatives of different social groups and giving them a chance to meet face to face and to exchange ideas and view difficult problems from each others point of view They have helped in this way to promote a true democracy of feeling The part the settlementTHE SOCIAL SETTLEMENT 65 has played in quickening social consciousness may be difficult to estimate but it has undeniably been large Today for instance we hear much less than a few years ago of the institutional church The social mission of the church is fortunately coming to be taken as a matter of course We expect every live church to be conducting or taking part in some form of social work And I believe that the settlement through its influence in stimulat ing a sense of social responsibility has reacted directly on the churches to produce these results There is a sense in which the settlement in its earlier days acted as a challenge to the churches The churches naturally looked somewhat askance at the settlement which undertook work with a careful avoidance of all religious features in quarters regarded by the church as its own preserves This in itself was enough to arouse suspicion against the move ment on the part of the church but there were further grounds of complaint It was soon apparent that the settlements were ab sorbing many of the more thoughtful young people who had been brought up within the churches Not a few college men and women coming to take up the active work of life and finding little sympathy in the church for their intellectual and social convictions turned with a sense of relief and satisfaction to the opportunity which the settlement offered of practical work in simple genuine human ways This fact did not pass unobserved by the churches and in addition they could not but recognize that the settlements were achieving results in the very districts in which they were compelled to admit utter failure The situa tion stirred the church to action Methods of socalled settle ment work clubs and classes and a variety of social activities were adopted and the institutional church was developed I do not wish to appear to claim that the settlement was the sole in fluence in quickening a sense of social responsibility in the church If the settlement had never been the church could not have failed to feel the touch of the spirit of the age Its social conversion was inevitable Still it remains true that the church and the settlement had too many common interests to escape the effect of mutual reaction Friction was sure to result unless extraordi nary care and forbearance were exercised on both sides It was hardly to be expected that on either side there should66 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW be a conscious effort to allay distrust and promote a good under standing The definition of the institutional church given by one of the leaders in that movement is significant He defined the institutional church as the social settlement plus religion I think one may detect here a hint of the influence of the settle ment upon the social movement within the church and also a suggestion of the churchs estimate of the social settlement Evidently from the point of view of the church the settlement lacked the one thing needful Happily much of this feeling has passed away A more sympathetic attitude has taken its place And yet the feeling still lingers to such an extent in the minds of many persons identified with the church that it may be worth while to add a word concerning the matter If those who today complain that the settlement lacks religion mean thereby that in their judgment it ought to conduct organized religious activities I have already expressed the reasons why I think their point not well taken To do that would be to introduce the very element that prevents the broad neighborhood relations so essen tial to the settlements success It places the settlement in the category of a mission It would be far better to decide at the outset whether to establish a mission or a settlement and then determine the question of religious work accordingly And if this complaint means as it sometimes does that there is anything in the nature of the settlement that makes it intrinsically hostile or even unfriendly to religion I should have again to take issue with the complainant Any doubt about the religious character and value of the settlement is based either upon a misappre hension of the settlement or an extremely narrow view of the significance of religion I believe the present social movement is essentially a religious movement It springs from human sympathy and expresses its sympathy in intelligent practical form for the welfare of mankind If the chief object which the truly religious man holds before his mind is the advancement of the kingdom of God through a life of loving service the social settlement worker can clasp hands with him Some settlement people may prefer to use a slightly different terminology in stating their aimto call things by different namesbut the things are not altered by the difference in the labels And if it is furtherTHE SOCIAL SETTLEMENT 67 urged that religion is concerned with the salvation of the individual as well as with bringing men into right relations with their fel lowmen the settlement can help even in this phase of religious work It does not presume to attempt to convert men in the conventional sense but if individual salvation is understood to include saving mans body and mind as well as his spirit it can make an important contribution to this larger process of redemp tion We are at last coming to realize the need of a sound physi cal basis for a normal moral and spiritual life and the settlement is a force in the readjustment of the physical and moral life of the individual as well as of the environment in which he lives Ser vice is not all of religion but it is an important element and the social settlement is a synonym for service If there is as I believe a better understanding of the settle ment on the part of those who represent the church it is likewise true that settlement workers generally are realizing the need of a closer coordination of all the moral and spiritual and social forces of the community The settlement worker and the social ized churchworker are finding much common standingground Religion is no longer tabooed in settlement circles if it ever was And I believe the churches on their part will come to see that in some neighborhoods at least for the present a settlement with out organized religious work can do a useful work which neither a mission nor even an institutional church can do Must we not rid ourselves of the idea that Christian work is one thing and humanitarian work quite another Does any one doubt that Jesus was fully as religious and quite as much engaged in Christian work when he was ministering to the sick and feeding the hungry as when he was preaching to the multitude or gently revealing the Samaritan woman to herself Both functions are of importance The one must supplement the other Not all organizations doing useful philanthropic and educational work and liberally supported by church people are required or expected to open their meetings with prayer or conduct revival services and it is hard to see why the settlement which is first of all a home should be viewed with misgiving because it concludes that its wisest course is to leave to the church all forms of active religious work68 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW But I believe the settlement will come to see more clearly the value of those spiritual processes and the power of that inspira tion which it is the function of the church to generate and set in motion And thus the church the synagogue and the social settlement will more effectually supplement each others work and bring about a correlation of spiritual and moral forces that will hasten the coming of that day when justice and good will shall rule in all relations between man and man It remains now to consider the question of the future of the settlement There are not wanting those who believe that the settlement will soon have served its generation and ought then to follow the example of the ancient leader of Israel who as we are told under similar circumstances fell on sleep Is this the case Is there sound reason to believe that the settlement method has accomplished about all that can be expected of it and that its days are numbered We are reminded that more and more the activities of the settlement are being turned over to the appro priate departments of the city government and that the settle ments themselves desire this and are constantly endeavoring to promote it we are told that when the process is complete and all activities now carried on by the settlements are municipalized the settlements may take in their signs put up their shutters and close their doors For the sake of argument we may grant that in time all the familiar activities of the settlement will be carried on by the community and we may assume that no new ideas will be evolved to require trying out although that is a somewhat improbable assumption But even so I think the settlement would still have a place of usefulness For one thing it would doubtless be necessary to have a voluntary organiza tion or group of people experienced in social work to cooperate with the city officials who were charged with its social enter prises If politics is to be kept out of the administration and the evils of mechanical methods reduced to their lowest terms by means of intelligent sympathetic human supervision and leader ship some group of private citizens who care about these things must be in close touch with the situation Today we have State Charities Aid Associations Public Education Associations and the like exercising a similar function What group would moreTHE SOCIAL SETTLEMENT 69 naturally take up this matter as its business than the settle ment group At a recent conference it was stated that the social work of the public schools in one of the larger Western cities had been successful only in those sections in which there were settle ments Furthermore is it not worth while to have a group of educated people with social and civic ideals living as citizens and neigh bors in the industrial quarters of great cities It does not re quire an active imagination to conceive of many services such a group could render In all large cities startling changes are tak ing place due to the movements of nationalities and races changes so rapid that often within a few years a neighborhood will under go a complete transformationthe Jews for example crowding out the Irish to be themselves displaced later by the Italians To be a constant factor in the midst of such kaleidoscopic changes the one established neighbor rooted and grounded in the neigh borhood persistently gathering facts supplying leadership and forming a rallyingpoint for all good citizens this is a service no other organization could render so effectively as the social settle ment As to the character of the settlement of the future one hesitates to venture a prediction I think however that one may de tect a tendency to revert to the simplicity of the early days of the movement Much passes today for settlement work and the settlement idea  that is only loosely related to that for which the settlement really stands It began as I have pointed out with a group of people of education and culture making their home in a neglected neighborhood with the idea of being good neigh bors and of sharing the common life From this simple beginning it has developed in most cases to include a large plant a staff of paid workers and a great variety of activities The effect has been to obscure the simplicity of the early idea The institu tional settlement has always been regarded by the friends of the movement as in a measure a necessary evila development which was required by the situation but permitted with regret The tendency now seems to be to a more decided reaction against the institutional type and this tendency gives promise of per manency for the method The older settlements will doubtless70 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW continue to endeavor to meet the needs that arise in their neigh borhoods as long as the municipality lags behind in its enter prises of social service even if this necessitates a further develop ment in the way of institutions But where new settlements are organized their promoters will do well to consider whether their opportunity does not lie in the direction of the simpler residential type Such a settlement could direct its energies chiefly to increasing still further the social usefulness of schools public libraries gymnasiums playgrounds recreationhouses and the like and would take a lively interest in seeing that all such work was efficiently maintained Its residents would not lack neigh borhood work and freed from the exacting duties of much club and class work they would have more time to devote to such im portant services as those which I have mentionedthe interpre tation of life and the initiation of and cooperation with new movements for social welfareservices which the settlement is peculiarly equipped to perform This seems to me to answer as well as it can be answered the question of permanency for it is difficult to believe that the time will arrive within the next few generations when social justice will be so firmly and widely established that such efforts will be altogether out of date When that happy day comes the settlement along with many other forms of philanthropic and charitable effort about which by the way one wonders why the question of permanency is never raised may be cheerfully relegated to the scrapheap of social endeavor In the mean time we may safely conclude that the settlement has a contribution of peculiar value to make to the work of setting up that new order of society which those who follow the lead of the Christ believe shall be eventually realized in the kingdom of God

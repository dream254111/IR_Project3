Earth,i207011, 297  XIV Account of Pendulum Experiments undertaken in the Harton Colliery for the purpose of determining the Mean Density of the Earth By G B AIRY Esq Astronomer Royal Received December 26 1855Read January 24 and 31 1856 SECTION IIntroductory and Historical 1 IN the spring of the year 1826 the idea occurred to me of attempting a deter mination of the Mean Density of the Earth by means of pendulumexperiments at the top and the bottom of a deep mine and rough preliminary calculations which seemed to show that the effect of accidental errors of observation on the ultimate result would probably be less than in the nethods which up to that time had been used confirmed me in the wish to try it The nature of these preliminary calculations was nearly the following 2 Conceive the earth to be a sphere of radius R and mean density D surrounded by a spherical shell of thickness c and density d so that the radius of the external surface is Rc As the attraction of the spherical shell upon a point at or within its inner surface is nothing the attraction at the confines of the inner sphere and shell is represented by 3 2  3 RD and the attraction at the external surface of 4 r R3D R3 Rd the shell is represented by   R c  wlich to the first power of R is 3 R  C2 R 4r RD1 2  D Calling the gravity at those two points respectively G and g  1 3 dD from which D   Considering the fiactions and G as the only quantities in this equation liable to sensible numerical error DR  As the density of the shell or d may be ascertained by actual examination SD D and therefole D R  xamination a jL j J D d G  D 3 In order to give a numerical value to the error of result suppose that 2 R nearly a proportion rather higher than MASKELYNES that 16000 which sup poses the thickness of the shell or the depth of the mine to be a quarter of a mile nearly and that j 432000 which corresponds to an error of 0 1 per day in the 2 R MDCCCLVIMR AIRYS ACCOUNT OF THE HARTON EXPERIMENT aD 16000 1 2 vibrations of a seconds pendulum Then 2  1 or the mean DB 3 432000 o density would be determined with an error not exceeding 16th part of the whole This error I apprehend is far less than those to which CAVENDISnS experiments were liable REICHs and BAILYS experiments had not been made at the date of this investigation but I do not except them from the same remark It is also quite as small as that to which the mere astronomical determination in the Schehallien experiment was subject When other elements of calculation are examined as tie general simplicity in the form of the ground for the mineexperiment and the coln plexity for the mountainexperiment the accurate knowledge of the geology for the mineexperiment and the obscurity for the mountainexperiment the difference becomes still more striking in favour of the mineexperiment as compared with that on Schehallien 4 In a subsequent section means will be given for enabling the reader to judge whether an accuracy like 01 vibration per day in the difference of the rates of pen dulums above and below in the mineexperiment has really been obtained Methods will also be indicated for computing the corrections depending on the irregularities of the earths surface I advert to these at present only to have the opportunity of explaining that the form of computation exhibited above is not final but is merely intended for a preliminary calculation showing the antecedent plausibility of the experiment 5 Upon communicating my views to Mr now Dr WHEWELL then like mnyselfS a resident Fellow of Trinity College Cambridge I found him entirely disposed to join me in undertaking the experiment My first idea had been to ascertain the rate of a clock at the top and the bottom of a mine and the locality whiclh first occurred to me was the Ecton Mine in Staffordshire But it was soon settled on discussion with Mr WHEWELL that detached pendulums would be preferable to clock pendulums and the Ecton Mine having proved on examination to be ill suited to our purpose the Dolcoath Mine near Camborne in Cornwall was selected partly at the suggestion of JOHN TAYLOR Esq The Royal Society and the Board of Longitude most liberally lent to us invariable pendulums clocks and other apparatus sufficient for the simultaneous observation of a pendulum above and one below and the Board of Admiralty lent us box and pocket chronometers to be used principally for the comparison of the upper and lower clocks 6 About the end of May 1826 we proceeded to Dolcoath assisted by the friendly introductions of the late DAVIES GILBERT Esq and of Dr PARIS and we received from the resident authorities of the mine every possible assistance to our experimnent and from the late Lord DE DUNSTANVILLE E W W PENDARVES Esq and other gentlemen of the country the most hospitable attention to our personal comforts And in spite of the labours and misfortunes of the Cornish enterprises I do not doubt that they are regarded by my companion as well as by myself as among the most 298FOR DETERMIINING THE MEAN DENSITY OF THE EARTH interesting in our lives Stations were provided for us at the surface and near the lowest part of the mine the latter being at a short distance from the South Shaft or Harriet Shaft near the junction of the granite and the killas in the 180fathom level the depth being measured from the adit for the discharge of the water pumped from the mine or nearly 1200 feet below the surface This place as is usual in the Cornish mines could only be reached by ladders 7 Our intention was to compare the vibrations of a detached pendulum in each station with the vibrations of a clock pendulumn in the manner whlich has acquired so much celebrity from the labours of KATER and SABINE and to compare the two clocks by means of chronometers carried on the person of an attendant One set of olbservations extending over several hours including if necessary more than one series of coincidences was to be observed each day When this should be carried far enough the pendulums were to be reversed and the observations were to be repeated or the two pendulums were to be compared as might seem best After overconming somne difficulties and with very great personal labour we found on com puting approxitmately the results that the chronometercomparisons were not trust worthy We resumed the work with a modification of the method of using the chro nometers which promised to render the results more accurate We were raising the lower pendulum up the South Shaft for the purpose of interchanging the two pendu lumns when from causes of whIichl we are yet ignorant the straw in which the pendui lurnbox was packed took fire the lashings were burnt away and tthe pendulum with some other apparatus fell to the bottom rThis terminated our operations of 1826 8 In the summer of 1828 we again attempted the experiXment in the sane locali ties and with the same general instrumental means Our personal powers however were far greater than in 1826 We had now the assistance of the Rev R SiHEP the late Rev S JACKSON Our plan principally at the instance of Mr SHEEPSHANKS was so modified as to admrit of incessant observations being made day and night for several days consecutively and this arrangement greatly diminished the injurious effects of chronometererrors A new difficulty now presented itself in the irregular and varying form of the pendulums knifeedges After tedious experiments on these which seemned at last likely to be successful out labours were suddenly stopped by the occurrence of a fall in the mine The lodes or metalliferous veins in the Cornish mines are usually bounded by niearly parallel planes inclined perhaps 30 or 40 to the vertical and the removal of the veinstuff even when as in this case the vacuity has been filled up as much as circumstances permit endangers the falling of the rock which is on the upper side of the lode On this occasion the general fall in consequence of the precautions above described did not exceed a few inches but large masses of rock were detached from their places and interrupted the work ing of the pumps and our lower station was soon flooded by the rise of the water And thus for the second time our attempts were defeated 2 R2 299MR AIRYS ACCOUNT OF THE HARTON EXPERIMENT 9 Many years passed on before sufficient leisure or sufficient motive for again trying the experiment presented itself to me The only great improvement in the application of the pendulum to the measure of gravity was BESSELS discovery reduced to a practical formn as regarded the English construction of the pendulum by Colonel SABINE of the necessity of an increased correction fol the pendulums buoyancy in the atmosphere I had however opportunities of observing the dif ficulties inherent in the CAVENDISH experiment from witnessing tile repetition of that experiment by my late friend Mr F BAILY At length in the year 1854 a new power was placed in my hands The galvanic system was established at the Royal Observatory and in the familiarity which we now possessed with telegraphic appli cations I perceived that the difficulty of comparing the upper and lower clocks would be almost entirely removed The coalmines of the Durham coalfield had been worked much deeper and the facility of access to these mines would materially diminish the labour of the experiment while the intimate acquaintance with the geological character of the country possessed by ttie coalowners and the general regularity of the beds would give great confidence in thfe ultimate calculations of the attraction of the mass of matter principally affecting the experiment After a lapse of twentysix years from the last attempt in Cornwall 1 therefore seriously took up the subject again and proceeded personally to examine the fitness of the coalmines of Durham for the experiment 10 Assisted by the introductions of DAVID LIETCH Esq MD and by the local knowledge of JAMES MATHER Esq I had little difficulty in fixing on a mine The deepest mines in the Durham coalfield are near the coast The deepest of all is thle Monk Wearmouth Colliery but it is so close to the sea its workings in fact extending far under the sea that it seemed probable that more of disadvantage would be intro duced by the complication of the elements of final computations than of advantage by its extreme depth The next in depth I believe is the Harton Pit at the distance of somewhat more than two miles from South Shields and about the same distance from the coast The general circumstances of form of surface c are as favourable as can usually be found Its depth is reputed to be 1260 feet On making known to WILLIAM ANDERSON Esq the principal owner of the coalmine my wish to try the experimtnent in that place I was at once assured that every assistance should be given to me In company with C WV ANDERSON Esq and with G W ARKLEY Esq local viewer and superintendent of the mineworks in 1854 August 5 I examined the buildings on the surface and the workings underground in the  Benshamn seam and stations for the pendulums were speedily chosen The two stations were exactly in the same vertical The upper station was a stable near the Mine Office The lower station was a wide part of a gallery now disused less than 200 yards from the bottom of the shaft in going from the bottom of the shaft to the station one half roughly speaking of the way passed along one of the tramways of the mine and the other half was along the disused gallery and at this distance the sound of 300FOR DETERMINING THE MEAN DENSITY OF THE EARTH the coaltrams c on the tramway was inaudible The Harton shaft is the down cast airshaft for a very extensive series of workings of which the upcast shaft is at the St Hilda pit in the town of South Shields and the lower pendulum station fromn its proximity to the Harton pit was constantly and agreeably ventilated with pure fresh air The owners of the mine immediately proceeded at their own expense to make the following preparations for the pendulums 11 In the stable for the upper station an additional brick wall was built round three sides of the space about 16 feet square intended for the pendulum room and an additional substantial ceiling was constructed above it and an anteroom was constructed on the fourth side so that the room was in fact surrlounded by double walls and ceiling The immediate entrance fromr the external air was into the ante roomn and from the anteroom there were doors into the pendulum room and into a narrow room at one side In this narrow roomt were afterwards placed the galvanic batteries and journeymanclock and the lamp for illutninating the pendulum disk The lamp for illuminating the face of the principal clock was in ttle anteroorn giving its light through a hole in the dividing wall and the observer was stationed in the anteroom his observing telescope being fixed in a hole in the wall From the gasworks of the mine gas was led to a gasstove in the anteroom and also to a writinglamp In order to Inake the support of the pendulum firm the soft earth was retmoved to the depth of 3 feet at which level the hard clay was reached whichl extends about 90 feet lower to the first bed of rock and the cavity was filled with ashllar stones united with mnortar at the joints the surface was paved level with flag stones and bricks 12 In the lower station solme uprighlt shores which had been placed in the space assigned for the pendulum roomn were remnoved and inclined rafters were substituted The rock was cut level and the bricks and flagstones were laid immediately on it Brick walls were built enclosing a trapezoidal room nearly representing a square of 16 feet with an anteroom and a third room and level ceilings were constructed above them 13 For the galvanic communication between the two stations two wires covered with gutta percha were led underground from the stable to the mouth of the pit and were then carried down to the bottom of the pit being supported in the following manner The shaft is divided fiom top to bottom by a wooden partition or brattice At every 100 feet in the descent a wooden peg about 6 inches long and 2 inches in diameter was fixed in the brattice The galvanic wires were wrapped round this peg and were pinched fast by a piece of wood which was screwed to the peg In this nanner the wires were held perfectly steady and no part was strained by an ex cessive weight hanging upon them On reaching the bottom of the shaft the wires were carried horizontally along the top of the galleries protected by boards of wood till they entered the lower station The labour of Telegraph Engineers which was 301MR AIRYS ACCOUNT OF THE HARTON EXPERIMENT requiried for fixing these wires and for other adjustments of the galvanic apparatus was contributed gratuitously by the Electric Telegraph Company the work being done under the direction of their resident agent at Newcastle Mr MATHEWS 14 The local arrangements being thus brought to a very satisfactory state I had next to provide the proper apparatus On my request through Colonel SABINE ireasurer of the Royal Society the Council of the Society immediately placed at my disposal the instruments which they possessed and which applied to my wants These were two invariable pendulums both by THOMAS JONES distinguished by the marlks 1821  and  No 8 respectively which were preserved in the Kew Observatory irton stands for the pendulums accompanied by wooden stands for the comparison clocks pieserved in the Magnetic Office at Woolwich and a clock by SHELTON which I had formerly used in Cornwall and whicht still bore my paper marks upon its pendulum To these I added a clock by EARNSHAW from the east dome of the Royal Observatory a journeymanclock fromn the Royal Obselvatory to be used in signaltiransmission two galvanometers similar to the ordinary speakingneedle of the galvanic telegraph  galvanic batteries barometers thermometers c Every instrument was brought for trial to the Royal Observatory 15 Each iron stand consists of a horizontal triangle of iron bars for base two inclined iron bars in a vertical plane for front their tops being screwed to the sides of an iron boxframe which supports the agateframe on which the knifeedge vibrates and one inclined bent iron bar behind screwed to the back of the same boxframe On erecting one of the iron stands at the Royal Observatory it was found impossible to pass the upper brass block of the pendulums to which the steel knifeedge is screwed through the holes of the boxfiame It was necessary there fore to enlarge the holes by filing and as this weakened thle front of the boxframe the following apparatus was introduced in order to strengthen it A small hexagonal iron frame was prepared consisting of a horizontal base nearly equal in length to the interior measure of the boxframrne two vertical sides nearly half the heighlt of the box frame two inclined sides and a horizontal top about onethird as long as the bottom Screws were tapped through the horizontal base This apparatus was placed in the front opening of the boxframe and when the screws were driven the short horizon tal top was forced up to the upper bar of the boxframe so as to give it all desirable firmness As the weakened stand furnished with this apparatus was evidently firmer than the other stand a similar apparatus was provided for the other stanld 16 The agateplanes and the knifeedges wlhich were much injured by rust were reground and polished by Mr SIMMS with the utmost care the knifeedges being finished to an angle of about 120 On mnounting them at the Royal Observactory it was found that they touched the agateplanes only in a few points and thte singularity of the mode of contact reminded me so strongly of the contact in Cornwall in 1828 thtat I do not doubt that one pendulumrn was the same and affected by the sanme faults A few interchanges c of pendulums showed that the fault was not in the agate 302FOR DETERMINING THE MEAN DENSITY OF THE EARTH planes but in the knifeedges Mr SIMMS on examination found that when the attaching screws were relaxed the bearing on the agateplanes was continuous and perfect It was evident therefore that the fault was in the surface of the brass blocks which carry the knifeedges On filing these it was found easy to bend the knifeedge into any form A surface was at length given to the brass which made the bearing of the knifeedges upon the agates absolutely perfect as far as the eye could discover The upper and lower pendulums when mounted in their proper stations vibrated in parallel planes as nearly as possible in the direction of magnetic East and West The graduated arcs for measuring the extent of vibration were divided to inches with continuous numeration fiomn one end and were placed behind the pendulum tails The thermometers two for each pendulum were suspended in front at about  and  the distances fiom tlle knifeedge to the bob Their indications were found to be all sensibly accordant 17 In fitting up the comparisonclocks a small alteration was made which proved exceedingly convenient The illuminated disk to be concealed by the tail of the invariable pendulum was an inclined section of a small cylindrical block attached by a central screw to the bob of the clock pendulum The inclined surface was covered with goldleaf A hole covered with glass was made in each side of the clockcase and through either of these the light of the illuminating lamp was thrown upon the goldleaf  By shifting the lamp and turning the small cylindrical block a brilliant light was reflected to the observingtelescope the lamp being always in a distant position and in a lateral direction Moreover by slightly turning the clock stand in azimauth the apparent breadth of the inclined disk was altered and it could thus be adapted to disappearance behind the pendulumtail The adjustible aperture through which the disk was seen and which was covered by the pendulumtail in its quiescent position was in front of the clockcase 18 By the side of each clockface a galvanometer was fixed The galvanic wires were led to and from the terminals of the galvanometer not immediately but through the intermediation of a circuitbreaker so that the observer could at any time inter rupt the current 19 The journeymanclock was thus fitted up Two wires were led into it one from the galvanic battery and the other in continuation of the course of the same wire from the journeyman to the next comparisonclock terminating within the journeyman in a pair of springs which performed the duty of circuitbreaker Upon the minutewheel of the journeymnan were four pins which as the wheel revolved pressed the two springs together thus completing the circuit in that part at every 15s of the journeymans time 20 The battery was the ordinary sandbattery of 24 cells The batteries and journeyman were in the sideroom of the upper station 303MR AIRYS ACCOUNT OF THE HARTON EXPERIMENT The wire fromn one end of the battery was led to one terminal of the journeyman From the othe o r terminal of the journeyman a wire was led to the circuitbreaker in connexion with the galvanometer of the upper clock From the other terminal of the galvanometer a wie was led down t eshaft to the necicuitbreaker in con nexion with the galvanometer of the lower clock From the other terminal of this lower galvanometer a wire was led up the mineshaft to the other pole of the battery Tlhus when both the upper and the lower circuitbreakers completed contact and at no other time the journeymanclock made the circuit complete and sent a current through both the galvanometers at every 15s of the journeymans tine 20 Plate XI contains views of the pendulumapparatus nearly in the state in which it was used in the upper station The principal diagram is a front view of the apparatus as mounted at Greenwich taken with the camera lucida and may be trusted for general accuracy The iron bars of the pendulumstand are about 14 inch square The stand of the clock does not touch the pendulumstand in any part The hiexagonal fiane introduced into the boxframe is conspicuous in this view The battey is not the same which wassed at the iine The mountiog at the clower station was exactly similar wanting only the journeymanclock and the battery The firane with agateplanes represented on a larger scale which is planted on the top of the boxframe is supported on three screwfeet the screwstalks ate per forated two are cut with an internal screwthread and long screws are passed upwards through smooth holes in the boxframe and act in these internal screw threads and draw them firmly down the perforation in the third is smooth and the long screw which passes down through it acts in a screwthread cut in the boxframe At the sides of the blocks which carry the agateplanes are notched brass plates turn ing upon pins connected by a stouter piece of brass beyond the pins through which a screw passes that acts in the solid block below by driving this screw the notches are raised and engage with the ends of the pendulumknifeedge and lift it off the agates 21 The system of observations which I proposed was the following One of the invariable pendulums was to be mounted at the upper station and the other at the lower station and the two pendulums were to be observed simultaneously by two ob servers The Swings  or series of vibrations were to follow each other incessantly day and night with no nlore interruption than would be required fol observing the galvanic signals reading thermorneters and making petty adjustments Six Swings each occupying in the gross four hours were to be taken in each day At con certed minutes of time before the first and after the last Swing and between the end of4each preceding Swing and the beginning of that which followed galvanic signals were to be observed Several Coincidences of the vibrations of the detached pendulum with the clock pendulum were to be observed in KATERS manner at the beginning and end of each Swing This system was to be maintained during the whole efficient time of one week then the pendulumrns with their agateplanes and 304FOR DETERMINING THE MEAN DENSITY OF THE EARTH thermometers but with no other apparatus were to be interchanged and a weeks observations were to be madein this state The pendulums were to be interchanged a second time and a thlird time so that in thte whole four series of observations would be taken but I thought it probable that less than a week would suffice for each of these latter series 22 On considering the amount of labour required for carrlying out this plan and considering also that it was not in my power to take an active part I judged that six observers would be necessary With the sanction of the Lords Commissioners of the Admniralty I appointed Mr EDWIN DUNKIN and Mr WILLIAM ELLIS Assistants of the Royal Observatory as two of the observers With the permission of M J JOHN SON Esq I was enabled to solicit and to obtain the services of Mr NORMAN POGSON Assistant of the Oxford Observatory Professor CHALLIS consented to my asking the aid of Mr G S CRISWICK Assistant of the Cambridge Observatory by permission of Professor CHEVALLIER Mr GEORGE RUiMKER Astronomer of the Durham Ob servatory joined the party and finally I was enabled by the kindness of R C CAR RINGTON Esq to avail myself of the services of Mr G 1H SIMMONDS Assistant of the Red Hill Observatory Mr DUNKIN superintended the parly and during the observations contiolled the local operations of every kind Under the admirable management of Mr DUNKIN and the zealous and orderly assistance of all the gentlemen whom I have named the work went on with the most perfect regularity I cannot express how mucht I am indebted to the hearty cooperation of every individual Assistant cluring the whole course of the operations from the beginning to the end Lodgings were provided for the party in the town of South Shields Their com fort during their singular occupation as well as my own on the occasions of my visits were greatly increased by the uniform kindness of the authorities of the mine and by thle hospitable attentions of ROBERT INGHAM Esq MpP JOHN ROBINsoN Esq Mayor of South Shields JAMES MATHER Esq J C STEVENSON Esq of the Jarrow Chemnical Works and other gentlemen resident in the town or neighbourhood Attendants in the mine were selected and placed under the command of the observers by the owners of the mine 23 I may now give a brief journal of the operations

Shields and I explained the nature of the observations to an assembly of the residents of South Shields and its neighbourhood 1854 October 25The instruments were finally dismounted and packed up for return to Greenwich and the party dispersed 24 In terminating this general history of the operation it is proper perhaps that I should briefly allude to the sources from which the expenses were defrayed The Royal Society in granting the loan of their pendulums and clock not only enabled me to undertake the operation with promptitude and with the security of using trustworthy instrutments but also removed one of the most serious causes of expense I have already alluded to the extensive works constructed by the owners of the Harton Colliery and which they made entirely at their own expense and to the liberality of the Electric Telegraph Company who gratuitously gave me their important assistance in the galvanic connexions In transmitting the instruments from the wharfs at Newcastle to South Shields Messrs STEVENSON and Co of the Jarrow Chemical Works gave the use of their rivercraft The Mayor and Corpo ration of South Shields unsolicited caused the surveys to be made which were needed for computation of the attraction of the ground Some parts of the appa ratus galvanometers wires stoves c were so evidently applicable to the pro spective wants of the Royal Observatory that they were not considered as a charge on the Experiment The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty on my laying before them my proposals contributed 100 which defrayed the greater part of the misceL laneous expenses The residual charges were borne by myself SECTION IIComparisons of the Upper and Lower Clocks 25 In the ordinary state the galvanic circuit was interrupted at both circuit breakers At the prearranged minute for commencing signals as nearly as possible each of the observers completed the connexion and then gave his attention to the galvanometer The movement of the needle at intervals of 15s nearly assured each observer that the other was prepared to observe and every observation of the clock titne of the movement of the needle was then efficient for comparison of the two clocks Only it was necessary to know precisely when the time of examining the written record of the timesignals should arrive which were the corresponding obser vations of the same galvanic current For this purpose the following instructions were given After observing the clocktimes of a few signals the upper observer interrupted the circuit during one signal only and then restored the connexion The lower observer after waiting one or two minutes did the same thing After another short delay the upper observer interrupted the circuit during two signals The lower obsrerve after a short delay did the same Then the observations were continued till the upper observer was satisfied withl the number after which he definitively 308FOR DETERMINING THE MEAN DENSITY OF THE EARTH broke the circuit the lower observer then broke circuit and both prepared to observe Coincidences of the pendulums On examining the interruptions of signals no difficulty was found in confronting the corresponding observations In one instance only between Swings 16 and 17 was the comparison totally lost in conse quence of one of the needles sticking fast The observation of the time of the start of the needle is not very delicate and this part of the operation would be made much more exact by catusing each clock to register its own seconds upon a common revolving barrel in the manner of the American transits 26 The observations on each side which had no corresponding observations on the other side being struck out the means of all the tilnes of the remaining observations in each group were taken and the difference of means was formed As a check the differences of the times by the two clocks for each individual signal were formed and the mean of the differences was taken In this manner there were formed for every group mean corresponding times of SHELTON the upper clock and EARNSHAW the lower clock the differences of these from group to group gave the corresponding changes of clockindications by the two clocks during the same period of absolute EARNSHAWS change of indication time and the quotient SHTONS change of indication gave the apparent ratio of rates The logalithm of this ratio was formed by means of CALIETS logarithms to eight decimals 27 A very cursory examination of these ratios showed that there was a consider able personal equation in the observation of the galvanometersignals Though from the nature of the combination to be hereafter described this scarcely produces an appreciable effect on the ultimate result I thought it desirable to ascertain approxi mately its magnitude and to apply the corresponding correction I proceeded as followsIn every instance in which the signalobservations at the beginning and at the end of a Swing were made by different observers I compared the logarithmns of EARNSIIAW apparent rates of SHL duringthat swing with the logarithms for the preceding and following swings in three instances however with only the preceding swing and formed the excess of the logaritihm of the intermediate swing above the mean of the preceding and following logarithmns This numerical excess may be compared with a symbolical formula in which the symbols represent not the actual error in time committed by each observer but the logarithm in 8figure units of the influ ence of his error on rates deduced from comparisons at 4hour intervals Twenty seven equations were thus formed By the method of minimum squares these were reduced to six of which from the nature of the case one was unnecessary their sum being identically equal to zero Assuming D Mr DUNKINS error 0 the others are found by solution of the equations Though the equations are not very favour able they suffice for giving very good corrections and they show in particular that Mr SIMMONDS recorded his times too early by nearly half a second The following 309310 MR AIRYS ACCOUNT OF THE HARTON EXPERIMENT Table exhibits this work the fundamental nlumbers being

DENSITY OF THE EARTH SECTION IIIGeneral System of observing the Pendulums and of reducing the Observations 29 Before describing the observations c I will remark that the pendulutns above and below were mounted in exactly the same manner Each angle of the iron stand in each station rested on a single brick and great care was taken by Mr DUNKIN that the bearing of these bricks should be perfectly solid It was also a subject of Mr DUNKINS special attention to make the supplementary hexagonal iron frame which I have described in article 15 quite firm  and above all to fix firmly at the beginning

pendulums Mr DUNKIN carefully oiled and wiped the knifeedges and their agateplanes At the beginning of every swing the observer raised the knifeedge from contact with the agateplane by the scrlewlifting apparatus and then lowered it gently to a definite line of beariing 30 The pendulum being observed in KATERS manner by using the concealment of the bright disk on the clockpendultmnbob behind the tail of the detached pen dulum when passing the apeirture through which alone the disk can be seen as indica tion of the Coincidence of the two pendulums in the times of passing their respective quiescent points and supposing tthat there are trifling errors in the adjustments of position it is seen in practice or is shown by a very simple investigation that the disk will first disappear in passing from one side suppose the right side towards the centre then will disappear in passing from the left side after which if the errors of adjustment are in the proper direction it will be invisible during several vibra tions then it will reappear on the left side and will finally reappear on the right side Either the mean of the times of the first and fourth phenomenon or the mean of the second and third or the mean of all four may be used as the true time of Coincidence and it was left to the discretion of the observers to adopt which they preferred They chose in every case to observe the first and fourth only This amounts in fact to using only one side of the aperture It is necessary for the success of this observation that the arc of the detached pendulum be less than that of the clock pendulum in fact it was always much less It is indifferent whether the detached pendulum vibrate quicker or slower than the clock pendulum in fact it always vibrated slower 31 Several Coincidences were always observed at thee beginning of a Swing and several at the end These gave the Interval of Coincidences nearly enough to enable me to fix upon the number of intervening Coincidences In general some of the observed Coincidences were rejected so that from two to five Coincidences were retained at the beginning and a number at the end so corresponding that the differ ence of their means would represent an integral number of Intervals thus there might be 3 at the beginning and 5 at the end or 4 at the beginning and 2 at the MDCCCLVI 2T 313314 MR AIRYS ACCOUNT OF THE HARTON EXPERIMENT end The mean of the first retained and the last retained being taken the difference of means divided by the number of Intervals gave a very exact value of Mean Interval In the Intelrval the detached pendulum lost two vibrations on the clock pendulum If then the times of the first and last mean be taken from the clockface and if n be the number of seconds referred to the

tion It is next required to investigate the correction to this logarithm depending on the extent of the arc of vibration  one of the conditions of the data of the probletm being that the arc is observed only at the beginning and the end of the Swing In the first place to compute the correction to the logarithmn supposing the arc of vibration constant Let the whole arc of vibration as seen upon the scale of inches be I For the pendulum 1821 suppose the scale to be placed 1 inch behind the pendulum and for the pendulum 8 18 inch behind the pendulum And suppose the distance of the objectglass of the observing telescope to be 100 inches Then 100 100 the real whole arc of vibration is IX 1o for pendulum 1821 and IX L08 for pen dulum 8 The lengths of the two pendulums from the knifeedge to the indicating point of the tail are respectively 607 and 602 inches Hence the proportion of the 100 real whole arc of vibration to the length of the pendulum is IX lol x 607 for pen 100 dulum 1821 and I x 1018 0 for pendulum 8 in which expressions the factors of I are sensibly the same Call this proportion C Then the number of vibrations C2 1  100 2 observed is to be multiplied by 1

in the comparisons of the clocks The rate of each pendulum upon its clock is either so constant or changes by such uniform degrees in the same direction that there is every reason to presume on the extremne steadiness both of the detactled pendulums and of the clocks Remarking then that when a large variable error is combined with a small variable error the magnitude of the probable error in the combination is scarcely affected by the small error we may treat these irregularities of result as if they were entirely due to irregularities of comparison and we lhave now to investigate the rule to be followed in combining the special results supposed to be erroneous from that cause only in order to obtain a final result whose probable error shall be the smallest possible It is evident that we are not to give equal weights to the 324FOR DETERMINING THE MEAN DENSITY OF THE EARTH different results for we should thus neglect all comparisons except the first and the last 40 Let the comparisons be numbered 0 1 2 3 4 nl n and let the swings be numbered 1 2 3 4 n Let the actual errors of comparison estimated by their effect on a fourhours rate in units of the last figure of 8figure logarithms be Eo E  E 3 E 4 E E4  E  E where E6 is supposed to be taken as if the comparison which was really omitted agreed with that produced by interpolation between the two neighbouring compari sons and let

the successive individual results for the rate of the lower pendulum on the upper pendulum and let A be the adopted value of that rate Now if A were rigorously correct we should have the following

part with an uncertainty of 27 part of the excess The acceleration of a seconds pendulum below is 2s24 per day with an uncertainty of less than Os001 46 But it is to be remarked that this estimate of the amount of uncertainty is obtained fiom the amount of uncertainty in each mean as deduced separately from the discordances of the individual results in the group contributing to that mean In comparing the means we shall see reason to suppose that the ultimate uncertainty is greater Thus though the probable errors of the means of Series 1 and 3 are 104 and 110 the difference of the means is 48 though the probable errors of the means of Series 2 and 4 are 33 and 94 the difference of the mean is 24 It is likely there fore that some cause of irregularity has occurred special to each series The most 330FOR DETERMINING THE MEAN DENSITY OF THE EARTH probable cause is some trifling error or unsteadiness in the manner of fixing the agateplaneframes upon the iron stands It is not a change in either of the pendulums after the Second Series inasmuch as the value of the mnean is altered the same way under the alternation of position of the pendulums Whatever the cause may have been the effect is extremely small There appears to be no reason for altering the concluded ratio of Gravity below to Gravity above The probable error stated in the last paragraph may be doubled but I think that there is no sufficient ground for trebling it The amount of the uncertainty so increased is insignificant for the purposes of this experiment 47 There remains however a serious question whether there may have been any difference in the circumstances of the upper and lower pendulums not included in the corrections applied which can produce an effect similar to that of a change of gravity The first point to be considered is the instability of the mountings The importance of a very firm foundation was perfectly understood by the able practical men by whom the groundwork was arranged and particularly by Mr ARKLEY and I conceive all was done which it was possible to do to make the floors solid The form of the iron stands is particularly well adapted to firmness Any tendency to lateral or other movement is counteracted by the endwise resistance of strong straight iron bars I had at first intended to interchange the iron stands in the middle of the operation but upon contemplating the mechanical firmness ensured by the plan of their construction and the exact similarity of the two stands in every respect I gave up this design being fully convinced that there might be risk of instability in a change but that there could scarcely be any sensible absolute instability and as I believe no sensible relative instability in the stands as they were planted The stands were supported in the same manner at both stations The mere determination of the relative rates of the detached pendulum and the clock pendulum by the method of coincidences is accurate almost beyond conception I do not see how it is possible that an error of OSO01 per day can enter from this cause The observers were so evenly interchanged in the upper and lower stations that no personal peculiarity in the method of reading the thermometers or of taking any other observations can have produced a sensible effect The following Table shows the aggregate number of turns taken by each Initials of observers name C D E P R S Number of turns above 5 5 4 4 5 5 Number of turns below 5 2 5 6 5 48 I will now point out the only cause from which in my judgment any percep tible error can arise It was my intention that the temperature of the upper station should be brought as near as could practically be done to that of the lower station In the first week however Mr DUNKIN was seized with a sudden and severe illness M x2 331MR AIRYS ACCOUNT OF THE HARTON EXPERIMENT and the transmission of the detailed observations to me was in consequence delayed An inequality of temperature which began accidentally was thus allowed to exist too long to admit of correction On comparing the mean of all the upper tempe ratures with the mean of all below I find that the lower station was warmer than the upper by 713 FAHR the upper and lower means being 55075 and 62088 Therefore if the adopted coefficient of thermal correction is erroneous the result of these experiments will be erroneous by the amount of that error on a range of temn perature of 713 There may yet be opportunity of verifying the coefficient of tem perature correction SECTION VIIMeasure of the djiffrence of level of the two PendulumStations sur vey of the neighbouring country and computation of the difference of attraction of the Earths shell on the two pendulums upon an assumed value of density 49 For measuring the depth of the mine Mr SIMMS furnished an iron wire I00 feet long with an attached scale at each end After the operation this wire was returned to Mr SIMMS and was found to have preserved its length sensibly unal tered It was used by Mr ARKLEY to measure the depth in the following manner Mr ARKLEY placed himself on the top of the Cage in which the coaltrams are conveyed from the bottom of the shaft to the top and when it was lowered 100 feet an assistant attached himself to the strong wirerope on which the Cage is suspended The assistant carried the upper end of the measuringwire and in the first instance held it level with the top of the shaft the steamengine used for raising or lowering the Cage being stopped Mr ARKLEY noted the position of the lower end of the wire to which a small stretching weight was attached and fixed a small nail in the brattice opposite to that lower end Then the Cage was lowered 100 feet the assistant held the top of the wire to the nail so fixed and Mr ARKLEY drove a second nail in the brattice opposite the lower end and so on to the bottom the last frac tion of 100 feet being measured with a measuring tape After this the levels of the pendulumstations were referred to the top and bottom of the shaft by the ordinary surveyors levelling operations The following is an abstract of the result ft in Depth of the shaft   1263 6 Rise of

at the 332FOR DETERMINING THE MEAN DENSITY OF THE EARTH upper and lower stations if we refer to the simple investigation in article 2 it will appear desirable to conduct the calculation which is to apply to the earths irregular form in such a manner as to preserve the characteristics of that simpler investigation as closely as possible These characteristics are 1 That a shell may be traced whose inner surface passes through the lower station and whose attraction at that lower station is 0 2 That the attraction of the same shell at the upper station is the same as if its matter were collected at the centre of the earth 3 That the attraction of the inclosed nucleus follows the same law in reference to the difference at the upper and lower stations as if all its matter were collected at the centre of the earth And we are to find how nearly we can approach to these circumstances on the sup position that the eartlhs constitution is irregular both in the neighbourhood of Har ton and in distant regions 51 Now if there are sensible irregularities near the upper station it will be impos sible to satisfy the first and second conditions at the same time For the demon stration of the evanescence of shellattraction at the lower station rests upon this that if chords be drawn through the point L Plate XI fig 1 included within the solid angle aLb as cLFC the portion FC must be equal to Lc and therefore if in the surface ab which may be a very minute field there be an elevation or depres sion there must be a corresponding elevation or depression over the whole AB which will be in extent a large continent and this will disturb the second condition It will be better therefore in the first instance to give no attention to the local irregu larities near the upper station to assume that the surface there is spherical to find with this assumption how we can satisfy the three conditions and afterwards to make allowance for the effect of the irregularities near the upper station 52 In fig 2 then conceive that for some distance on each side of L say twenty or thirty times the depth of L the external surface is sensibly spherical and con ceive that at A B C c there are local irregularities perhaps large in extent as compared with the depth of L but very small as compared with AB in fig 1 Trace the inner surface DEF by making ADLa BELb CFLc c These lines however are to be made geometrically equal only when the density of the matter is the same as that above L if the density about A is less than that above L take the geometrical length AD greater than La in the same proportion Then the attraction of the shell on the point L will be strictly equal to 0 Moreover its attraction on the point U will be sensibly the same as if its formi were free from irregularities For the attractions on U are all added together the irregularities are local and nume rous and are partly additive and partly subtractive and by hypothesis we have excluded all the irregularities near L or U which individually can be important And it may be accepted as a universal principle that when a result is produced by the addition of a great number of small components which are liable individually to 333MR AIRYS ACCOUNT OF THE HARTON EXPERIMENT small irregularities  or  affecting the ratio or multiplier of each the sum of all the components will be sensibly free from the effects of these irregularities 53 In like manner if we divide the nucleus by planes parallel to the tangent at L or U as shown by the dotted lines in fig 2 or indeed in any other way thle attrac tions of the slices thus formed are additive both in their effect on L and in their effect on U Therefore for the nucleus generally by the same reasoning as that above the effect of irregularities in the outline and therefore the effect of the irre gularities in the outline of the earth on which these depend will be as I conceive sensibly evanescent But this does not apply to irregularities in the geological con stitution of the earth at a small distance below L because these irregularities or rather that one irregularity may be sensible in proportion to the whole change of attraction between U and L This is a source of uncertainty from which no expe riments made on the earth itself can be perfectly free We must trust in a great measure to the general regularity of stratification c of the distirict for supporting us in the confidence that ttlere is no great disturbance in the law of attractions of the nucleus upon the points U and L 54 To illustrate in some degree the difference in the attractions and changes of attraction depending on different slices of a sphere I have supposed a homogeneous sphere divided into twenty slices by equidistant planes parallel to the tangent at L and have computed by formulse easily investigated the attraction of each slice upon the point L at the surface and upon a point raised above the surface by Ioth part of the radius Omitting the factor T the iesults are

plane which bisects the radius drawn to L divides the sphere into two segments whose attractions on L are equal 334FOR DETERMINING THE MEAN DENSITY OF THE EARTH These different slices it may be remarked correspond to equal surfaces on the sphere and upon these it is not improbable that the irregularities may mainly depend 55 In much of the preceding reasoning it will be remarked I have tacitly assumed that large continental elevations or large marine depressions as we find them on the earth do not interfere materially with the general law of attraction based on the spherical distribution of matter For the reasons which seem to sustain this assumption I would refer to a paper by me printed in the Philosophical Transactions 1855 on the Attractions of Mountain Masses It will also be remarked that I have not introduced the consideration of the earths rotation I conceive its effects to be extremely insignificant but the fotrmulae applying to it are so unmanageable that I have not pursued it to details Considering now that it is sufficiently shown that on the supposition that the surface in the neighbourhood of U is truly spherical we may use the method of article 2 with no other uncertainty than that explained in article 53 1 shall pro ceed with the corrections for the inequalities of the surface near U 56 First I shall investigate the attraction of the matter included between two horizontal planes figure 3 upon points U and L in these planes whose distance ort the separation of the planes is equal to the distance UL in figure 2 Divide the whole of the matter into cylindrical rings of which UL is the axis let the internal and external radii of one of these rings be g and  Call the azimuth of any part of the ring 0 the endsurface of the prism included between 0 and 080 is gM Let z be the vertical ordinate measured upwards firom the lower plane the solid content of the part of the prism included between z and z is g  z  its attraction on the point L supposing its density to be d is dppz and the resolved dpap 8 zxz part of this in the vertical direction is  Integating wittl respect to z P  z between the limits zO and zcUL we have d22 Integrating  pf c2 Integating with respect to d for the whole circumfelence we have 2xd g PP  Inte grating with respect to g we have 2rdgcg2c2 This is the attraction upwards on the point L The attraction downwards on the point U will be the same and thus the difference of attractions on U and L estimated in the downwards direction will be 4rd f c2 c2 If the planes be continued without limit or g be infinite this expression becomes 4rcd Now the attraction of a shell whose thickness is c computed as in article 2 is 0 for the point at the inner surface of the shell and 4rcd for the point at the outer surface and therefore the difference is 4recd Hence it is indifferent wliether we consider the difference of attractions at the upper and lower stations independent of the change in the attraction of the nucleus caused by the change of distance from it 335MR AIRYS ACCOUNT OF THE HARTON EXPERIMENT as produced by a shell of matter or as produced by the matterbetween two parallel planes of unlimited extent If the extent of the planes be limited their form being circular let gnc then the difference of attractions is 4rcd n 1nA c 4rcd 1  nearly If as in the Harton experiment r mile e3 miles 12c nearly this r 11 23 4rcd 1T nearly Thus it appears that of the effect is produced by the matter within three miles of the pendulumstations It is evident therefore that it is not necessary to give attention to the small inequalities of the ground at any great distance from the pendulumstations 57 The inequalities which we have to consider are entirely at the surface and do not in any case exceed in vertical measure onetenth of the depth of the mine They may therefore be considered as being actually at the surface and if their horizontal extent is not very great each may be considered as collected at its centre of gravity Its effect on the upper station will be 0 its effect on the lower station will be C  cX dx volume where e is the horizontal distance of the centre of gravity An eminence will increase the attraction upwards and a depression will diminish it But as our only object is to find the difference of attractions on the two stations we may estimate the whole with changed sign as an effect on the upper station then an eminence will increase the attraction downwards and a depression will dimi nish it There is however one depression which it is desirable to consider in a different way namely that of the sea The depth of the sea itself is less important than the depression below the tableland wlhich continues with little change of level to the edge of the cliffs and a sufficiently accurate estimate may be formed of the measure of depression including the effect of the attrtaction of the water considered as uni form The line of cliff may be considered as straight Let a be the distance from the pendulumstation to the straight line of cliff measured perpendicularly to that line b the depth of the depression let x be parallel to a and y parallel to

nearly Integrating first with respect to y fiom oo to  co we have  2db c Integrating then with respect to x from a to oo we have dbc These formuloe will suffice for our purpose It is only necessary further to remark that as the unit of measure is absolutely arbitrary and as the numerical and gra phical operations are a little facilitated by using for unit the depth of the mine I have in all the subsequent calculations adopted that quantity 1256 feet as unit 336FOR DETERMINING THE MEAN DENSITY OF THE EARTH of measure In all the preceding formule c must now be made 1 The earths radius

volume other elevation or depression will be  X d where all lineal measures are to be  p 12 referred to the minedepth as unit 58 On my making known that information on the inequalities of the ground would be required for the final calculations the Mayor and Corporation of South Shields directed that the necessary surveys should be made and the execution of this work was entrusted to CHRISTOPHER THOMPSON Esq Surveyor for the Corporation This gentleman entered fully into my views and after the proper surveys for elevation furnished me with a map extending about three miles in all directions round Harton with the elevations above high water in feet marked at numerous points I found that a line might be drawn nearly ten depths distant from the upper station touching the cliffs of Tynemouth and the cliffs southeast of Harton and ranging for some distance along the coast of Durham I therefore drew a line parallel to this at ten depths distance from the upper station and divided the whole country into squares with sides of one depth each whose sides were parallel and perpendicular to this These squares I grouped as appeared most convenient as will be seen in the Map Plate XII fig 4 the principal object being to secure a proper representation of Jarrow Slake and the Valley of the Tyne and adopted for each group the elevation in feet above high water which Mr THOMPSONS elevations of special points suggested The elevation of the upper pendulumstation was 74 feet Consequently the vertical measure which was to be used for computing the volume in the formula above was Elevati2 74 Of this formula a small table was prepared The quantity g was 1256 measured graphically from the map and I21 was formed graphically from it 59 Adopting for the sea so far as its effects are principally

I IMR AIRYS ACCOUNT OF THE HARTON EXPERIMENT 62 Without pretending to extreme accuracy we may consider the thickness and specific gravity of the beds as represented with sufficient accuracy for the present purpose by the following numbers 1211 feet of rocky and shaly beds   specific gravity 256 30 feet of coaly beds   specific gravity 143 15 feet completely worked out  specific gravity 000 From these the mean specific gravity is found to be 250 63 Substituting this for d in the expression at the end of the last Section we get for the mean density of the Earth as determined from these experiments 6566 0182 where the last term expressing the probable error ought to be at least doubled 64 The value thus obtained is much larger than that obtained from the Schehal lien experiment and considerably larger than the mean found by BAILY frotn the torsionrod experiments It is extremely difficult to assign with precision the causes or the measures of the errors of any of these determinations and I shall content myself with expressing my opinion that the value now presented is entitled to conm pete with the others on at least equal terms 342 343  XV Supplement to the  Account of Pendulum Experiments undertaken in the Harton Colliery  being an Account of Experiments undertaken to determine the Correction for the Temperature of the Pendulum By G B AIRY Esq Astronomer Royal Received February 13Read March 6 1856 SECTION IXIntroductory and Historical 65 IN order to remove as far as possible the slight uncertainty in the result of the Harton Experiment depending on the mean difference of temperature of the Pendulums I again borrowed the two Pendulums and the Clock SHELTON from the Royal Society and prepared them for use in the following manner Two rooms were selected at the Royal Observatory which appeared well adapted for a series of pendulum experiments One is the Laundry of the Dwelling louse a room on the basement story almost entirely sunk below the level of the Lawn and Front Court but bordered on two sides by a dry area with stone floor laid immediately upon the solid ground The chimneyopening and other crevices were carefully stopped up and a hotairstove with funnel leading into the chimney was planted in the room by means of this stove the temperature of the room could be maintained with reasonable steadiness nearly to 90FAHR The Pendulum 8 with Clock EARNSHAW were mounted in the usual way in this room A screen was placed between the stove and the pendulum which effectually prevented the pendulum and its thermo meters from receiving any sensible heat by radiation The other room is the Lower Record Room a room with stone floor laid except at its centre upon the solid ground warmed by a heating apparatus below the centre of the floor The Pen dulum 1821 with Clock SHELTON were mounted in one side of this room As a hot airpipe rises in the centre of the room this pipe also was screened to prevent unfair radiation on the pendulum c although here the necessity for such caution was far less pressing than in the Laundry 66 The plan proposed for operations was to compare the clocks by carrying a Solar Chronorneter from one to the other and observing their readings at the time of coincidence of beats a method which admits of extreme accuracy when the clocks are so near together that the chronometer can be carried without risk of disturbance to divide the operations into Four Series numbered in sequence Fifth Sixth Seventh Eighth to make no alteration whatever in the pendulums nor even to dismount them between one series and another but to make Pendulum 1821 hot and 8 cool in the Fifth and Seventh Series and Pendulum 8 hot and 1821 cool in the Sixth and Eighth Series and through the extent of each Series to keep up the Swings inMR AIRYS ACCOUNT OF THE HARTON EXPERIMENT incessant sequence as in the observations at Harton The uncontrolled conduct of the experiments was entrusted to Messrs DUNKIN and ELLIS and I am confident it will be found that they are inferior to none that have ever been made In all cases the fires for warming the rooms were lighted nearly twentyfour hours before the observations began 67 When the pendulumboxes were opened at Greenwich two of the four thermo mreters which had been used at Harton were missing and all attempts to trace them have hitherto failed Two thermometers belonging to the Royal Observatory one by THOMAS JONES and one by TROUGHTON and SIMMS were substituted for them It would have been desirable to use the very same thermometers which were used in the Harton experiment but it is probable that with the considerable range of tempe rature used in these experiments the accidental differences between two thermometers made by makers of repute will not produce any sensible effect on the result 68 The following is the journal of operations Fifth Series Pendulum 1821 in heat 1856 Jan 1Observations commenced a little before noon Mr DUNKIN observed

include an increased range of physical conditions there will always be some doubt as to the propriety of selection of that matllematical function which is assumed to increase proportionally with the indications of the physical measurer I have here assumed that the changes of the logartithms of the temperaturecorrection are simply proportional to the changes of thermometerreading The table below

how the individual results of each Series are to be combined And here it is to be remarked that the principal cause of error is not in these experiments tihe uncertainty of comparisons of clocks which was almost the only source of error in the experiments at the mine It is probable that the amount of uncertainty from this cause is here nearly unappreciable The principal sources of error will lie in the circumstances of the pendulumobservations chiefly perhaps 350FOR DETERMINING THE MEAN DENSITY OF THE EARTH in the insecurity of the indications of the temperature of the pendulums as inferred fromn the readings of the neighbouring thermometers After consideration of these points I have thought it best to give equal weights to the results And for compa rison with the simple mean of these I have taken the simple mean of the thermo meterreadings Thus I obtain Log Rate Pendulum 1821 Temperature of Temperature of Rate Pendulum 8 1821 8 Fifth Series  000072198 8471 4780 Sixth Series

supposed that the material state of the pendulums would be sensibly the same during the whole continuance of the observations and it was expected therefore that the results of the Fifth and the Seventh Series would be in close accordance andc that the results of tte Sixth and the Eighth Series would be in close accordance Now the fact is that the results of the Fifth and Seventh Series agree pretty well when regard is had to the circumstances of forced temperature the discordance 0O00000149 corresponds to 0Os3 per day nearly or to 0072 of tempe rature but the discordance between the Sixth and Eighth is 000000842 which corresponds to 1SP68 per day or to 4009 of temperature It would therefore seem at fitst sight that there is strong reason to suppose that some change took place in one of the pendulums after the Seventh Series 74 As there is no reason whatever for supposing a change before the end of the Seventh Series let us take the mean of the Fifth and Seventh Series and compare it A with the Sixth Series alone B with the mean of the Sixth and Eighth Series and from these comparisons let us in each case obtain a relation between the two pendulumns nearly independent of temperature Thus we shall have Comparison A og Rate Pendulum 1821 Temperature of Temperature of g Rate Pendulum 8 1821 8  Mean of Fifth and Seventh Series  000072273 8906 4904 Sixth Series  000072827

dividing by 2 the effect of the mine is eliminated and that of temperature is sensibly eliminated and we obtain Rate Pendulum 1821 Log Rate Pendulum 000072568 This agrees so nearly with the result of Comparison A as greatly to increase the pre sumption that some change took place in one pendulum after the Seventh Series 75 Let then z be the increase in units of the 8th decimal of the logarithm

reference to thle effect of the Earths rotation and ellipticity in modifying the numerical results of the Hiarton Experiment I was favoured by that gentleman with an investigation which with his permission I subjoin as a valulable addition to my own paper  I shall suppose the surface of the Earth to be an ellipsoid of revolution and will employ the notation made use of in my paper on

exterior to the Earths surface r being measured from the centre and 0 fiom the axis of rotation a is the equatorial radius s the ellipticity w the angular velocity m the ratio of the centrifugal force

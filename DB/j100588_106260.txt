F R S and Astronomer Royal P R A C T I C A L astronomy was much be nefited by the invention of the wire micrometer for measuring differences of right ascension and declination nor did it receive less advantage from Mr SAVERYS most ingenious invention of the divided objectglass micrometer which has been rendered more commodious by the late Mr JOHN DOLLONDS applica tion of it to the objectend of a reflecting telescope or the present Mr PETER DOLLONDS application of it to the objectend of an achromatic refracting one Read Dec 18 1777 But valuable as the objectglass micrometer un doubtedly is some difficulties have been found in the use of it owing to the alterations in the focus of the eye which are apt to cause it to give different measures of the same angle at different times For instance in measuring the Suns diameter the axes of the pencils of rays which come through the two segments of the objectglass from 4 contrary800 Dr MASKELYNES Account of contrary limbs of the Sun crossing one another at the focus of the telescope under an angle equal to that of the Suns diameter the union of the limbs of the two images of the Sun cannot appear perfect unless the eye be disposed to see objects distinctly which are placed at point of intersection But if the eye be disposed to see objects distinctly which are placed nearer the object glass than the intersection is the two limbs will appear separated by the interval of the axes of the pencils in that place and if the eye be disposed to see objects dis tinctly which are placed farther from the objectglass than the intersection is the two limbs will appear to en croach upon each other by the distance of the axes of the pencils after their crossing taken at that place To explain this let ov plate XIX fig 1 represent the centres of the two semicircular glasses of the object glass micrometer separated to the distance ov from each other subtending the angle o a v equal to the Suns dia meter at the point a which is the common focus of the two pencils of rays having o a and v a for their axes namely those proceeding from contrary sides of the Sun and passing through the contrary semicircles and let d be the eyeglass It is evident that if d be properly placed to give distinct vision of objects placed at the point a the rays o a v a as well as all the other rays belonging 5 toa new prismatic Micrometer 801 to those pencils will be collected into one point upon the retina of the eye and consequently the two opposite limbs of the two images of the Sun will seem to coin cide and the two images of the Sun to touch one ano ther externally But if the state of the eye should alter the place of the eyeglass remaining the same the eye will be no longer disposed to see the image formed at the point a distinctly but to see an object placed at ef nearer to or farther from the objectglass distinctly and therefore an image will be formed on the retina exactly similar to the somewhat confused image formed by the rays on a plane perpendicular to their course at ef Con sequently as the two cones of solar rays b o a c v a formed by the two semicircles are separated or en croach upon one another at this point of the axis by the distance ef the two images of the Sun will not seem to touch one another externally but to separate or to encroach upon one another by the interval ef The error hereby introduced into the measure of the Suns diameter will be the angle erf subtended by ef at r the middle point between o and v which is to eaf or oav the Suns ap parent diameter as ae to er or even to ar on account of the smallness of ae with respect to ar These considerations concerning the cause of a prin cipal error that has been found in the objectglass micro V O L LXVII 5 H meter802 Dr MASKELYNES Account of meter led me to inquire whether some method might not be found of producing two distinct representations of the Sun or any other object which should have the axes of the pencils of rays by which they are formed diverg ing from one and the same point or nearly so and it occured to me that this might be done by the refraction of a prism placed to receive part of the rays proceeding from the object either before or after their refraction through the objectglass of a telescope If the prism be placed without the objectglass the rays that are re fracted through it will make an angle with the rays that pass beside it equal to the refraction of the prism and this angle will not be altered by the refraction of the objectglass afterwards Consequently two images of an object will be represented and the prism so applied will enable us to measure the apparent diameter of any ob ject or any other angular distance which is equal to the refraction of the prism But if the prism be placed within the objectglass that is to say betweenthe object glass and eyeglass the angle measured by the instrument will vary according to the distance of the prism from the focus of the objectglass bearing the same ratio to the refraction of the prism as the distance of the prism from the focus bears to the focal length of the objectglass Leta new prismatic Micrometer 803 Let A C B fig 2 represent the objectglass and d the eyeglass of a telescope and P R a prism placed to in tercept part of the rays coming from an object sup pose the Sun before they fall on the objectglass The rays E E proceeding from the Eastern limb of the Sun and refracted through the objectglass A C B without pas sing through the prism will form the corresponding point of the Suns image at e and the rays w w proceed ing in like manner from the Western limb of the Sun will be refracted to form the correspondent point of the Suns image at w But the rays 2F 2E 2W 2W pro ceeding in like manner from the Eastern and Western limbs of the Sun and falling on the prism PR and thence refracted to the objectglass ACB will after re fraction through it form the correspondent points of the Suns image at 2e 2w Let the refraction of the prism be equal to the Suns apparent diameter in this case at whatever distance the prism be placed beyond the object glass the two images of the Sun we 2w2e will touch one another externally at the point e2w for the rays 2w 2w proceeding from the Western limb of the Sun being inclined to the rays EE proceeding from the Eastern limb in the angle of the Suns apparent diame ter will after suffering a refraction in passing through the prism equal to the Suns apparent diameter emerge 5 H 2 from804 Dr MASKELYNES Account of from the prism and fall upon the objectglass parallel to the rays EE and consequently will have their focus 2w coincident with the focus e of the rays EE and therefore the two images of the Sun we 2w2e will touch one another externally at the point e2w and the instrument will measure the angle E C 2 W and that only But if the prism be placed within the telescope the angle measured by the instrument will be to the refrac tion of the prism as the distance of the prism from the focus of the objectglass is to the focal distance of the objectglass or if two prisms be used to form the two images with their refracting angles placed contrary ways as represented in fig 3 and 4 the angle measured will be to the sum of the refractions of the prisms as the distance of the prisms from the focus of the objectglass is to the focal distance of the objectglass For let ACB fig 3 represent the objectglass and d the eyeglass of a telescope and PR RS two prisms interposed between them with their refracting angles turned contrary ways and the common sections of their refracting planes touching one another at R The rays proceeding from an object suppose the Sun will be disposed by the re fraction of the objectglass to form an image of the Sun at the focus but part of them falling on one prism and part on the other will be thereby refracted contrary ways so as to form two equal images we 2w2e which ifa new prismatic Micrometer 805 if the refractions of the prisms be of proper quantities will touch one another externally at the point e 2w Let ECN be the axis of the pencil of rays EE proceeding from the Suns Eastern limb and wco the axis of the pencil of rays ww proceeding from the Suns Western limb and the point N the place where the image of the Suns Eastern limb would be formed and the point o where that of the Western limb would be formed were not the rays diverted from their course by the refractions of the prisms But by this means part of the rays EE which were proceeding to N falling on the prism PR will be refracted to form an image of the Suns Eastern limb at e while others of the rays EE which fall on the prism RS will be refracted to form an image of the Suns Eastern limb at 2e In like manner part of the rays WW which were proceeding to form an image of the Suns Western limb at o falling on the prism RS will be refracted to form an image of the Suns Western limb at 2w coincident with e the point of the image correspondent to the Suns Eastern limb while others of the rays WW which fall on the prism PR will be refracted to form the image of the Suns Western limb at w The two images we 2w2e are supposed to touch one another externally at the point e 2w The ray EFR which belongs to the axis ECN and is refracted by the prism PR to e undergoes the refraction NR e which be cause806 Dr MASKELYNES Account of cause small angles are proportional to their sines and the sine of N R e is equal to the sine of its supplement N R C is to N C R as N C or C e is to N R or R e In like manner the ray W G R which belongs to the axis WCO and is refracted by the prism RS to 2w or e undergoes the refraction OR e which is to O C e as O C or C e is to R O or R e therefore by composition O R N the sum of the refractions O R e N R e is to O C N the sum of the angles O C e N C e or the Suns ap parent diameter as C e to R e that is as the focal distance of the objectglass to the distance of the prisms from the focus of the objectglass Or let the prisms PR RS be placed with their refract ing angles P S turned from one another as in fig 4 the refraction of the prism P R will transfer the image of the Sun from O N to w e and the refraction of the prism R S will transfer the image O N to 2w2e the two images 2w2e w e touching one another externally at the point 2 e w Let E C N W C O be the axes of the pencils of rays proceeding from the two extreme limbs of the Sun and N O the points where the images of the Suns Eastern and Western limbs would be formed by the objectglass were it not for the refraction of the prisms the ray E F R which belongs to the axis E C N and is refracted by the prism R S to 2e undergoes the refraction N R 2e and the ray W G R which belongs to the axis W C O and is refracted bya new prismatic Micrometer 807 by the prism P R to w undergoes the refraction O R w Now N C 2 e part of the angle measured is to N R 2 e the refraction of the prism RS as Rw to Cw and O C w the other part of the angle measured is to O R w the refrac tion of the prism P R in the same ratio of R w to Cw there fore O C N the whole angle measured is to O R N the sum of the refractions of the two prisms as R w to C w that is as the distance of the prisms from the focus of the objectglass to the focal distance of the object glass When the prisms are placed in the manner repre sented in fig 3 the point e of the image w e is illumi nated only by the rays which fall on the objectglass be tween A and F and the point 2 w only by the rays which fall on the objectglass between B and G Now the an gles C R F C R G equal to the refractions of the prisms being constant the spaces F C C G will increase in propor tion as the distances R F R G increase and the spaces A F GB diminish as much and therefore the images at the point of mutual contact e 2 w will be each illuminated by half the rays which fall on the objectglass when the prisms are placed close to the objectglass but will be enlightened less and less the nearer the prisms are brought to the focus of the objectglass But808 Dr MASKELYNES Account of But when the prisms are placed in the manner shewn in fig 4 the images at the point of contact as the prisms are removed from the objectglass towards the eyeglass will be enlightened with more than half the rays that fall on the objectglass and will be most enlightened when the prisms are brought to the focus itself for the point 2e of the image 2w2e will be enlightened by all the rays EE that fall on the objectglass between B and F and the point w of the image we will be enlightened by all the rays ww which fall on the objectglass between A and G But the difference of the illuminations is not very considerable in achromatic telescopes on account of the great aperture of the objectglass as the greatest space FG is to the focal distance of the objectglass as the sum of the sines of the refractions of the prisms is to the radius There is a third way and perhaps the best of placing the prisms so as to touch one another along their sides which are at right angles to the common sections of their refracting planes In this disposition of the prisms the images will be equally enlightened namely each with half the rays which fall on the objectglass wherever the prisms be placed between the objectglass and eye glass Froma new prismatic Micrometer 809 From what has been shewn it appears that this in strument which may be properly called the prismatic micrometer will measure any angle that does not exceed the sum of the refractions of the prisms excepting only very small angles which cannot be taken with it on ac count of the vanishing of the pencils of rays at the junc ture of the two prisms near the focus of the objectglass that it will afford a very large scale namely the whole focal length of the objectglass for the greatest angle measured by it and that it will never be out of adjust ment as the point of the scale where the measurement begins or the point of o answers to the focus of the objectglass which is a fixed point for celestial objects and a point very easily found for terrestrial objects All that will be necessary to be done in order to find the value of the scale of this micrometer will be to measure accurately the distance of the prisms from the focus when the instrument is set to measure the apparent dia meter of any object subtending a known angle at the centre of the objectglass which may be easily found by experiment as by measuring a base and the diameter of the object observed placed at the end of it in the man ner practiced with other micrometers for the angle sub tended by this object will be to the angle subtended by a celestial object or very remote land object when the VOL LXVII 5 I distance810 Dr MASKELYNES Account of distance of the prisms from the principal focus is the same as it was found from the actual focus in the ter restrial experiment as the principal focal distance of the objectglass is to the actual focal distance in the said ex periment It will I apprehend be the best way in practice in stead of one prism to use two prisms refracting contrary ways and so divide the refraction between them as re presented in fig 3 and 4 Achromatic prisms each composed of two prisms of flint and crownglass placed with their refracting angles contrary ways will un doubtedly be necessary for measuring angles with great precision by this instrument and I can add with plea sure that I find by experiment made with this instru ment as it was executed by Mr DOLLOND with achro matic prisms ground with great care for this trial above a twelvemonth ago that the images after refraction through the prisms appear very distinct and that obser vations of the apparent diameters of objects may be taken in the manner here proposed with ease and pre cision Two or more sets of prisms may be adapted to the same telescope to be used each in their turn for the more commodious measurement of different angles Thus it may be very convenient to use one set of prisms for mea 1 suringa new prismatic Micrometer 811 suring angles not exceeding 36 and consequently fit for measuring the diameters of the Sun and Moon and the lucid parts and distances of the cusps in their eclipses and another set of prisms to measure angles not much exceeding one minute and consequently fit for measur ing the diameters of all the other planets This latter set of prisms will be the more convenient for measuring small angles on account of a small imperfection attend ing the use of this micrometer as before mentioned namely that angles cannot be measured with it when the prisms approach very near the focus of the objectglass the pencils of rays being there lost at the point where the prisms touch one another Upon the principles that have been here explained a prisms placed within the telescope of an astronomical in strument adjusted by a plumbline or level to receive all the rays that pass through the objectglass may conve niently serve the purpose of a micrometer and supersede the use both of the vernier scale and the external micro meter and the instrument may then be always set to some even division before the observation Thus the use of a telescope level may be extended to measure with great accuracy the horizontal refractions the de pression of the horizon of the sea and small altitudes and depressions of land objects Time and experience 5 1 2 will812 Dr MASKELYNES Account of will doubtless suggest many other useful applications of this instrument A paper from the learned Abbe BOSCOVICH was read before this Society the ninth of last June describing a similar contrivance as an invention of the Abbe ROCHON in which the Abbe BOSCOVICH himself also claims some share I therefore desire to acquaint this Society that I communicated this invention to Mr DOLLOND and had it executed by him and also shewed the instrument itself so executed to my esteemed friend ALEXANDER AUBERT esq fellow of this Society a gentleman very well quali fied to judge of things of this nature above a twelve month before the communication of the Abbe BOSCO VICHS paper as will appear from their written attesta tions drawn up at my desire describing the particulars of the communication of this invention which I made to them so long ago May I be permitted to remark that this instrument having been executed by my directions in several forms by Mr DOLLOND between the months of March and August 1776 and set up and tried at his house in the presence of several of his workmen could not be considered as an absolute secret concealed from the public However I doubt not that the following attesta tions of Mr AUBERT and Mr DOLLOND will sufficiently prove my title to this invention of the prismatic micro 6 metera new prismatic Micrometer 813 meter and I take this opportunity of exhibiting to the Society the instrument itself mentioned in Mr DOL LONDS letter as executed by himself according to my di rections and sent to the Royal Observatory in the month of August 1776 Greenwich December 11 1777 T O T H E R E V D R M A S K E L Y N E R E V S I R St Pauls Churchyard Nov 22 1777 A C C O R D I N G to your desire I send the following particulars of the experiments which were made by your directions for compleating a new kind of micrometer for measuring small angles About the beginning of April 1776 I received your first directions respecting this mat ter which were to make two prismatic glasses or wedges of such angles that rays of light which passed through them should be refracted about 18 of a degree these were to be placed between the objectglass and eyeglass of an achromatic telescope about 30 inches long The angular edges of the two prismatic glasses were to be placed in contact with each other they were to be moved in a parallel position from the objectglass to the focus814 Dr MASKELYNES Account of focus of the eyeglass and to be of such a size as to cover the aperture of the objectglass when brought close to it By the refraction of these wedges two images were formed in the telescope which were at the greatest dis tance about 36 when the wedges were close to the ob jectglass and approached as they were moved towards its focus where they united so that the whole focal distance of the objectglass was to be the length of the scale for measuring the angular distance of the two images formed in the telescope When these wedges were applied as above described the two images were found to be coloured to a great degree occasioned by the refraction of the wedges This defect you directed me to remove by making the prismatic glasses or wedges achromatic on the same principles as the achromatic objectglasses and after some difficulties this was ef fected the two images formed in the telescope appeared free from colours and distinct The above experiments were made in a rough wooden tube with an inconve nient method of moving the wedges by hand in this state it was when shewn to ALEXANDER AUBERT esq F R S towards the end of May 1776 after which you desired to have it done in a more compleat manner in a brass tube with a means of turning the tube round to take angles in different directions and a method of movinga new prismatic Micrometer 815 moving the wedges with a screw This was completed about the middle of August in the same year and then sent to the Royal Observatory I have the honour to be REVEREND SIR Your obedient humble servant P E T E R D O L L O N D I H E R E B Y certify that in the month of May 1776 the Rev Mr MASKELYNE Astronomerroyal produced to me at Mr DOLLONDS house in St Pauls churchyard and in his presence as a new invention of his own an instrument for measuring small angles con sisting of two achromatic prisms or wedges applied be tween the objectglass and eyeglass of an achromatic telescope about 30 inches long by moving of which wedges nearer to or farther from the objectglass the two images of an object produced by them appeared to approach to or recede from each other so that the focal length of the objectglass became a scale for measuring the angular distance of the two images London Nov 27 1777 A L E X R A U B E R T

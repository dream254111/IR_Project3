ADVANTAGE FROM MR SAVERYS MOST INGENIOUS INVENTION OF THE DIVIDED OBJECTGLASS MICROMETER WHICH HAS BEEN RENDERED MORE COMMODIOUS BY THE LATE MR JOHN DOLLONDS APPLICA TION OF IT TO THE OBJECTEND OF A REFLECTING TELESCOPE OR THE PRESENT MR PETER DOLLONDS APPLICATION OF IT TO THE OBJECTEND OF AN ACHROMATIC REFRACTING ONE READ DEC 18 1777 BUT VALUABLE AS THE OBJECTGLASS MICROMETER UN DOUBTEDLY IS SOME DIFFICULTIES HAVE BEEN FOUND IN THE USE OF IT OWING TO THE ALTERATIONS IN THE FOCUS OF THE EYE WHICH ARE APT TO CAUSE IT TO GIVE DIFFERENT MEASURES OF THE SAME ANGLE AT DIFFERENT TIMES FOR

DISPOSED TO SEE OBJECTS DISTINCTLY WHICH ARE PLACED AT POINT OF INTERSECTION BUT IF THE EYE BE DISPOSED TO SEE OBJECTS DISTINCTLY WHICH ARE PLACED NEARER THE OBJECT GLASS THAN THE INTERSECTION IS THE TWO LIMBS WILL APPEAR SEPARATED BY THE INTERVAL OF THE AXES OF THE PENCILS IN THAT PLACE AND IF THE EYE BE DISPOSED TO SEE OBJECTS DIS TINCTLY WHICH ARE PLACED FARTHER FROM THE OBJECTGLASS THAN THE

OF RAYS BY WHICH THEY ARE FORMED DIVERG ING FROM ONE AND THE SAME POINT OR NEARLY SO AND IT OCCURED TO ME THAT THIS MIGHT BE DONE BY THE REFRACTION OF A PRISM PLACED TO RECEIVE PART OF THE RAYS PROCEEDING FROM THE OBJECT EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER THEIR REFRACTION THROUGH THE OBJECTGLASS OF A TELESCOPE IF THE PRISM BE PLACED WITHOUT THE OBJECTGLASS THE RAYS THAT ARE RE FRACTED THROUGH IT WILL MAKE AN ANGLE WITH THE RAYS THAT PASS BESIDE IT EQUAL TO THE REFRACTION OF THE PRISM AND THIS ANGLE WILL NOT BE ALTERED BY THE REFRACTION OF THE OBJECTGLASS AFTERWARDS CONSEQUENTLY TWO IMAGES OF AN OBJECT WILL BE REPRESENTED AND THE PRISM SO APPLIED WILL ENABLE US TO MEASURE THE APPARENT DIAMETER OF ANY OB JECT OR ANY OTHER ANGULAR DISTANCE WHICH IS EQUAL TO THE REFRACTION OF THE PRISM BUT IF THE PRISM BE PLACED WITHIN THE OBJECTGLASS THAT IS TO SAY BETWEENTHE OBJECT GLASS AND EYEGLASS THE ANGLE MEASURED BY THE INSTRUMENT WILL VARY ACCORDING TO THE DISTANCE OF THE PRISM FROM THE FOCUS OF

APERTURE OF THE OBJECTGLASS AS THE GREATEST SPACE FG IS TO THE FOCAL DISTANCE OF THE OBJECTGLASS AS THE SUM OF THE SINES OF THE REFRACTIONS OF THE PRISMS IS TO THE RADIUS THERE IS A THIRD WAY AND PERHAPS THE BEST OF PLACING THE PRISMS SO AS TO TOUCH ONE ANOTHER ALONG THEIR SIDES WHICH ARE AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE COMMON SECTIONS OF THEIR REFRACTING PLANES IN THIS DISPOSITION OF THE PRISMS THE IMAGES WILL BE EQUALLY ENLIGHTENED NAMELY EACH WITH HALF THE RAYS WHICH FALL ON THE OBJECTGLASS WHEREVER THE PRISMS BE PLACED BETWEEN THE OBJECTGLASS AND EYE GLASS FROMA NEW PRISMATIC MICROMETER 809 FROM WHAT HAS BEEN SHEWN IT APPEARS THAT THIS IN STRUMENT WHICH MAY BE PROPERLY CALLED THE PRISMATIC MICROMETER WILL MEASURE ANY ANGLE THAT DOES NOT EXCEED THE SUM OF THE REFRACTIONS OF THE PRISMS EXCEPTING ONLY VERY SMALL ANGLES WHICH CANNOT BE TAKEN WITH IT ON AC COUNT OF THE VANISHING OF THE PENCILS OF RAYS AT THE JUNC TURE OF THE TWO PRISMS NEAR THE FOCUS OF THE OBJECTGLASS THAT IT WILL AFFORD A VERY LARGE SCALE NAMELY THE WHOLE FOCAL LENGTH OF THE OBJECTGLASS FOR THE GREATEST ANGLE MEASURED BY IT AND THAT IT WILL NEVER BE OUT OF ADJUST MENT AS THE POINT OF THE SCALE WHERE THE MEASUREMENT BEGINS OR THE POINT OF O ANSWERS TO THE FOCUS OF THE OBJECTGLASS WHICH IS A FIXED POINT FOR CELESTIAL OBJECTS AND A POINT VERY EASILY FOUND FOR TERRESTRIAL OBJECTS ALL THAT WILL BE NECESSARY TO BE DONE IN ORDER TO FIND THE VALUE OF THE SCALE OF THIS MICROMETER WILL BE TO MEASURE ACCURATELY THE DISTANCE OF THE PRISMS FROM THE FOCUS WHEN THE INSTRUMENT IS SET TO MEASURE THE APPARENT DIA METER OF ANY OBJECT SUBTENDING A KNOWN ANGLE AT THE CENTRE OF THE OBJECTGLASS WHICH MAY BE EASILY FOUND BY EXPERIMENT AS BY MEASURING A BASE AND THE DIAMETER OF THE OBJECT OBSERVED PLACED AT THE END OF IT IN THE MAN NER PRACTICED WITH OTHER MICROMETERS FOR THE ANGLE SUB TENDED BY THIS OBJECT WILL BE TO THE ANGLE SUBTENDED BY A CELESTIAL OBJECT OR VERY REMOTE LAND OBJECT WHEN THE VOL LXVII 5 I DISTANCE810 DR MASKELYNES ACCOUNT OF DISTANCE OF THE PRISMS FROM THE PRINCIPAL FOCUS IS THE SAME AS IT WAS FOUND FROM THE ACTUAL FOCUS IN THE TER RESTRIAL EXPERIMENT AS THE PRINCIPAL FOCAL DISTANCE OF THE OBJECTGLASS IS TO THE ACTUAL FOCAL DISTANCE IN THE SAID EX PERIMENT IT WILL I APPREHEND BE THE BEST WAY IN PRACTICE IN STEAD OF ONE PRISM TO USE TWO PRISMS REFRACTING CONTRARY WAYS AND SO DIVIDE THE REFRACTION BETWEEN THEM AS RE PRESENTED IN FIG 3 AND 4 ACHROMATIC PRISMS EACH COMPOSED OF TWO PRISMS OF FLINT AND CROWNGLASS PLACED WITH THEIR REFRACTING ANGLES CONTRARY WAYS WILL UN DOUBTEDLY BE NECESSARY FOR MEASURING ANGLES WITH GREAT PRECISION BY THIS INSTRUMENT AND I CAN ADD WITH PLEA SURE THAT I FIND BY EXPERIMENT MADE WITH THIS INSTRU MENT AS IT WAS EXECUTED BY MR DOLLOND WITH ACHRO MATIC PRISMS GROUND WITH GREAT CARE FOR THIS TRIAL ABOVE A TWELVEMONTH AGO THAT THE IMAGES AFTER REFRACTION THROUGH THE PRISMS APPEAR VERY DISTINCT AND THAT OBSER VATIONS OF THE APPARENT DIAMETERS OF OBJECTS MAY BE TAKEN IN THE MANNER HERE PROPOSED WITH EASE AND PRE CISION TWO OR MORE SETS OF PRISMS MAY BE ADAPTED TO THE SAME TELESCOPE TO BE USED EACH IN THEIR TURN FOR THE MORE COMMODIOUS MEASUREMENT OF DIFFERENT ANGLES THUS IT MAY BE VERY CONVENIENT TO USE ONE SET OF PRISMS FOR MEA 1 SURINGA NEW PRISMATIC MICROMETER 811 SURING ANGLES NOT EXCEEDING 36 AND CONSEQUENTLY FIT FOR MEASURING THE DIAMETERS OF THE SUN AND MOON AND THE LUCID PARTS AND DISTANCES OF THE CUSPS IN THEIR ECLIPSES AND ANOTHER SET OF PRISMS TO MEASURE ANGLES NOT MUCH EXCEEDING ONE MINUTE AND CONSEQUENTLY FIT FOR MEASUR ING THE DIAMETERS OF ALL THE OTHER PLANETS THIS LATTER SET OF PRISMS WILL BE THE MORE CONVENIENT FOR MEASURING SMALL ANGLES ON ACCOUNT OF A SMALL IMPERFECTION ATTEND ING THE USE OF THIS MICROMETER AS BEFORE MENTIONED NAMELY THAT ANGLES CANNOT BE MEASURED WITH IT WHEN THE PRISMS APPROACH VERY NEAR THE FOCUS OF THE OBJECTGLASS THE PENCILS OF RAYS BEING THERE LOST AT THE POINT WHERE THE PRISMS TOUCH ONE ANOTHER UPON THE PRINCIPLES THAT HAVE BEEN HERE EXPLAINED A PRISMS PLACED WITHIN THE TELESCOPE OF AN ASTRONOMICAL IN STRUMENT ADJUSTED BY A PLUMBLINE OR LEVEL TO RECEIVE ALL THE RAYS THAT PASS THROUGH THE OBJECTGLASS MAY CONVE NIENTLY SERVE THE PURPOSE OF A MICROMETER AND SUPERSEDE THE USE BOTH OF THE VERNIER SCALE AND THE EXTERNAL MICRO METER AND THE INSTRUMENT MAY THEN BE ALWAYS SET TO SOME EVEN DIVISION BEFORE THE OBSERVATION THUS THE USE OF A TELESCOPE LEVEL MAY BE EXTENDED TO MEASURE WITH GREAT ACCURACY THE HORIZONTAL REFRACTIONS THE DE PRESSION OF THE HORIZON OF THE SEA AND SMALL ALTITUDES AND DEPRESSIONS OF LAND OBJECTS TIME AND EXPERIENCE 5 1 2 WILL812 DR MASKELYNES ACCOUNT OF WILL DOUBTLESS SUGGEST MANY OTHER USEFUL APPLICATIONS OF THIS INSTRUMENT A PAPER FROM THE LEARNED ABBE BOSCOVICH WAS READ BEFORE THIS SOCIETY THE NINTH OF LAST JUNE DESCRIBING A SIMILAR CONTRIVANCE AS AN INVENTION OF THE ABBE ROCHON IN WHICH THE ABBE BOSCOVICH HIMSELF ALSO CLAIMS SOME SHARE I THEREFORE DESIRE TO ACQUAINT THIS SOCIETY THAT I COMMUNICATED THIS INVENTION TO MR DOLLOND AND HAD IT EXECUTED BY HIM AND ALSO SHEWED THE INSTRUMENT ITSELF SO EXECUTED TO MY ESTEEMED FRIEND ALEXANDER AUBERT ESQ FELLOW OF THIS SOCIETY A GENTLEMAN VERY WELL QUALI FIED TO JUDGE OF THINGS OF THIS NATURE ABOVE A TWELVE MONTH BEFORE THE COMMUNICATION OF THE ABBE BOSCO VICHS PAPER AS WILL APPEAR FROM THEIR WRITTEN ATTESTA TIONS DRAWN UP AT MY DESIRE DESCRIBING THE PARTICULARS OF THE COMMUNICATION OF THIS INVENTION WHICH I MADE TO THEM SO LONG AGO MAY I BE PERMITTED TO REMARK THAT THIS INSTRUMENT HAVING BEEN EXECUTED BY MY DIRECTIONS IN SEVERAL FORMS BY MR DOLLOND BETWEEN THE MONTHS OF MARCH AND AUGUST 1776 AND SET UP AND TRIED AT HIS HOUSE IN THE PRESENCE OF SEVERAL OF HIS WORKMEN COULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ABSOLUTE SECRET CONCEALED FROM THE PUBLIC HOWEVER I DOUBT NOT THAT THE FOLLOWING ATTESTA TIONS OF MR AUBERT AND MR DOLLOND WILL SUFFICIENTLY PROVE MY TITLE TO THIS INVENTION OF THE PRISMATIC MICRO 6 METERA NEW PRISMATIC MICROMETER 813 METER AND I TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY OF EXHIBITING TO THE SOCIETY THE INSTRUMENT ITSELF MENTIONED IN MR DOL LONDS LETTER AS EXECUTED BY HIMSELF ACCORDING TO MY DI RECTIONS AND SENT TO THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY IN THE MONTH OF AUGUST 1776 GREENWICH DECEMBER 11 1777 T O T H E R E V D R M A S K

OF MICROMETER FOR MEASURING SMALL ANGLES ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF APRIL 1776 I RECEIVED YOUR FIRST DIRECTIONS RESPECTING THIS MAT TER WHICH WERE TO MAKE TWO PRISMATIC GLASSES OR WEDGES OF SUCH ANGLES THAT RAYS OF LIGHT WHICH PASSED THROUGH THEM SHOULD BE REFRACTED ABOUT 18 OF A DEGREE THESE WERE TO BE PLACED BETWEEN THE OBJECTGLASS AND EYEGLASS OF AN ACHROMATIC TELESCOPE ABOUT 30 INCHES LONG THE ANGULAR EDGES OF THE TWO PRISMATIC GLASSES WERE TO BE PLACED IN CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER THEY WERE TO BE MOVED IN A PARALLEL POSITION FROM THE OBJECTGLASS TO THE FOCUS814 DR MASKELYNES ACCOUNT OF FOCUS OF THE EYEGLASS AND TO BE OF SUCH A SIZE AS TO COVER THE APERTURE OF THE OBJECTGLASS WHEN BROUGHT CLOSE TO IT BY THE REFRACTION OF THESE WEDGES TWO IMAGES WERE FORMED IN THE TELESCOPE WHICH WERE AT THE GREATEST DIS TANCE ABOUT 36 WHEN THE WEDGES WERE CLOSE TO THE OB JECTGLASS AND APPROACHED AS THEY WERE MOVED TOWARDS ITS FOCUS WHERE THEY UNITED SO THAT THE WHOLE FOCAL DISTANCE OF THE OBJECTGLASS WAS TO BE THE LENGTH OF THE SCALE FOR MEASURING THE ANGULAR DISTANCE OF THE TWO IMAGES FORMED IN THE TELESCOPE WHEN THESE WEDGES WERE APPLIED AS ABOVE DESCRIBED THE TWO IMAGES WERE FOUND TO BE COLOURED TO A GREAT DEGREE OCCASIONED BY THE REFRACTION OF THE WEDGES THIS DEFECT YOU DIRECTED ME TO REMOVE BY MAKING THE PRISMATIC GLASSES OR WEDGES ACHROMATIC ON THE SAME PRINCIPLES AS THE ACHROMATIC OBJECTGLASSES AND AFTER SOME DIFFICULTIES THIS WAS EF FECTED THE TWO IMAGES FORMED IN THE TELESCOPE APPEARED FREE FROM COLOURS AND DISTINCT THE ABOVE EXPERIMENTS WERE MADE IN A ROUGH WOODEN TUBE WITH AN INCONVE NIENT METHOD OF MOVING THE WEDGES BY HAND IN THIS STATE IT WAS WHEN SHEWN TO ALEXANDER AUBERT ESQ F R S TOWARDS THE END OF MAY 1776 AFTER WHICH YOU DESIRED TO HAVE IT DONE IN A MORE COMPLEAT MANNER IN A BRASS TUBE WITH A MEANS OF TURNING THE TUBE ROUND TO TAKE ANGLES IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AND A METHOD OF MOVINGA NEW PRISMATIC MICROMETER 815 MOVING THE WEDGES WITH A SCREW THIS WAS COMPLETED ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF AUGUST IN THE SAME YEAR AND THEN SENT TO THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY I HAVE THE HONOUR TO BE REVEREND SIR YOUR OBEDIENT HUMBLE SERVANT P E T E R D O L L O N D I H E R E B Y CERTIFY THAT IN THE MONTH OF MAY 1776 THE REV MR MASKELYNE ASTRONOMERROYAL PRODUCED TO ME AT MR DOLLONDS HOUSE IN ST PAULS CHURCHYARD AND IN HIS PRESENCE AS A NEW INVENTION OF HIS OWN AN INSTRUMENT FOR MEASURING SMALL ANGLES CON SISTING OF TWO ACHROMATIC PRISMS OR WEDGES APPLIED BE TWEEN THE OBJECTGLASS AND EYEGLASS OF AN ACHROMATIC TELESCOPE ABOUT 30 INCHES LONG BY MOVING OF WHICH WEDGES NEARER TO OR FARTHER FROM THE OBJECTGLASS THE TWO IMAGES OF AN OBJECT PRODUCED BY THEM APPEARED TO APPROACH TO OR RECEDE FROM EACH OTHER SO THAT THE FOCAL LENGTH OF THE OBJECTGLASS BECAME A SCALE FOR MEASURING THE ANGULAR DISTANCE OF THE TWO IMAGES LONDON NOV 27 1777 A L E X R A U B E R T

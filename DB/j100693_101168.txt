Saltsmay likewise be affirmd concerning Volatil Salts and Vinous Spirits The for mer are afforded not only by vegetables and Animals but also by some Minerals And altho immediately upon their production or extraction out of the several substances which did yield them they appear sensibly different from each other and are without dispute endowd with very different properties chiefly Medicinial yet they may all by slight artifices be reduced unto such a Simplicity and I dentity as that neither the most acute and faithful Senses nor the mostrational and niceExperimentcan find or makewithout addi taments the least disagreement or discrimination Volatil Salts abound in most Vegetables from which they some times may be extricated by simple Distillation but usually praevi ous Fermentation is required of which operation I have formerly Z rendred170 rendred a particular Accompt This Salt may also be obtaind from Soot Urine the Blood of Men and other Animals from Bones and especially Craniums or Skuls of Men from many sorts of Horns and indeed no subject yields them so copiously as those which are annually cast by Staggs or other Deer from Vipers in great plenty as also from divers other Animals I need not here mention F actitious Salt Armoniackthat being a commixture of seve ral of the mentiond Substances with SeaSalt Also many Minerals and Fossils contain Volatil Salt vast quantities of Salt Armoniack being found in many parts of the East which was probably subli med into those Caverns whence it is extracted by the force of Sub terraneal Fires Which conjecture is sufficiently authorised by the same Substances being gatherd near the Crateres or Mouths of our European Vulcans of AEtna HeclaVesuvius in Campis Phlaegreis in England also near the Mouths of several CoalMines which have been accidentallysiredAnd of recent memory that Torrent of melt ed Minerals which boiled over the Crucible ifI may so speak up on the late Conflagration in Sicily and poured itself into the adja cent Plains This liquid Fireas it cooledcondensingbecame crusty at top and almost every where Stones of Salts were sublimd or thrust forth by the violence and fury of the Heat Some of these Salts resembled thevulgar SeaSaltothersNitersomewereof an Alumi nous an divitriolick naturebut thatwhichwas most copious and uni versal was Armoniackwhich although much discolouredand ren dred very impure in most places by its union with various metal lick and mineral particles yet did chiefly as the Factitious Salt Ar moniack consist of Marine and Volatil commonly calld Urinous Salts as did also the forementiondas many Experiments have in formd me too numerous and tedious to be here inserted Besides these Mineral Substances already mentiond several sorts of Earth Clays and Marle which are fetcht from the Superficial or Corti cal part of the Earth do contain store of Volatil Salts which ap pear upon Distillation And from some of them I myself have fre quently seperated greater quantities than will be easily credited It would waste more time and paper than I am willing to lose andre quire more patience in the Reader than the Subject deserves should I relate or particularly enumerate the peculiar Sensible and Medici nal properties where by the Salts are discriminated which the seve ral forementiond Substances do afford I shall therefore at present only suggest what in my apprehension renders them so multifari ously different from each otherand then discover How theymay be reduced  See Numb 101171 reduced unto the same Common nature and if you please being united become an Uniform and Homogeneous Substance wherein I may challenge the most severe Criticks and experienced Chymists to find a greater variety of Parts and Qualities than what is absolutely necessary to constitute the Essence and Defi nition of a Volatil Salt in the abstract It was long since by the famous Van Helmont judiciously ob servd and by many Experiments confirmed That variety of Sulphurs did chiefly discriminate the Species of Mixt bodies and that most of the considerable changes which were made in or upon them were occasiond by separating their own or super inducing an extraneous Sulphur If this be affirmd of Sul phur a pretended Simple Homogeneous body and the second Principle of the Chymists it is denied But if he intended as is most probable by Sulphur a substance which when separated is usually inflammable and doth ordinarily appear in an Oleagi nous form I esteem his assertion very probable and specious Let us make a short reflection on the Oyles extracted out of Ve getables by the assistance of Common water which areastwere a Compendium of the Vegetables that afforded them being emi nently and manisestly enobled with most of those sensible and those more hidden Qualities that did determinate the Vegetables whilst flourishing Whereas their Salts whether fixt or volatile their Waters and Earths can boast of little which discovers whence they proceeded unless they retain some small portion of their re spective Oyles whose presence occasions those slight differences which discriminate them from each other and being thereof deprived they relapse into their Elementary simplicity The same happens as with Fixed so in Volatile Salts which are different so long as they retain any mixture of those Oyles and Sulphurs wherewith the Concrete that afforded them was imbu cd from which being freed they all agree in one Common essence Although I could confirm this Position by a great number and variety of Experiments I shall for the present aquiesce in some ea sie and obvious operations which will sufficiently manifest that all Volatil Salts being freed from adhering Oyles or Sulphurs become forth with Homogeneal and Uniform Take any Volatil Salt whether Vegetable Animal or Mineral put it into a very tall Glasbody or Bolthead sublime the Salt in Ashes BM in a Lampfurnace or with other equal temperat heat the more remiss the better Repeat this Operation twice or thrice Z 2 Most172 Most of the Oyl remains at the bottom or adheres to the sides of the vessels employed and the Salts will not easily be distinguisht from each other agreeing in most if not all manifest qualities But because this Operation will not so well succeed unless the Vessels be very conveniently shaped and the fire exactly regulated by a Judicious experienced Artist for either skill or due care be ing wanting somesmall portion of the more subtile fugitive Olea ginous or Sulphureous particles will ascend with and infect the Salts which are thereby still in some measure if I may so speak specificated I shall briefly represent a more certain and facile me thod of reducing them into one Common nature and denomination Pour upon the VolatilSalt you would purify a convenient quan tity of wellrectified Spirit of common Seasalt When the Salt is satiated which is discerned by ceasing of the heat ebullition or commotion then with a gentle equal heat abstract the phlegme and with it some small quantity of Volatil Salt which not being closely united is upon the first accession of heat presently dismissed Sublime the remaining dry substance which will become good Ar moniac Salt This being pulverised and mixed with equal parts of a pure and wellcalcined Alcalisate Salt or if you pour thereon a strong lixivium or Solution of any perfect Alcali the Alcalisate Salt combining more closely with the Acid than the Volatile this latter will be elevated by a small degree of heat and appears either immediately or upon rectification in the form of a dry subtile fu gitive Salt perfectly free from the contagion of Oyles or Sulphurs And by this Common method of procedure All volatil Salts al though the Tribes and Concrets that afforded them were exceeding different and distant and they also disagreeing in Sensible and as they are commonly stiled Occult qualities are brought unto a perfect agreement in some few common properties I might add that whatsoever can be effected by Artificial opera tions in order to the Unspecificating of Volatile Salts is more naturally and speedily performd by the Air which is as I could fully demonstrate impreg nated with a Volatil Salt partly sublimed by Subterraneous and extracted by Ce lestial fires partly expired from Ani mals during their life and both from them and Vegetables upon the dissolution or dissociation of their constituent parts in Are sactions and Fermentations These Salts being received into the vast  See Mr Boyles Tract of Suspicions about some Latent Qualities in the Air lately printed and come to my hands when I committed this Discourse to the Press Of which Tract I should have given an Accompt in these Pa pers among other Books but that it is accompanied with some other pic ces that are not yet quite printed off173 vast subtle fluid Expanse are immediately devested of their discriminating properties and become the Instruments of sundry remarkable effects and operations not only in Natural but also Artificial productions Which Salt may be obtaind by sundry methods andout of several substances in its pure simplicity but being once dissolvd in Rain and Dews and thereby infi nuated into the Earth or otherwise caught and conveyed into Vegetables they are soon speciated and by union with the other Principles or Corpuscles of a different nature do degenerate or are exalted which you please and of Simple at least com paritively become Compound substances yet easily again re ducible by Nature or Art unto their primitive Simplicity These are not Dreams of a delirous Chymist but Positions which I could confirm by an entire Series of Experiments pos sibly hereafter to be communicated if upon a strict examen I find them worthy publishing in this Inquisitive and Judicious Age It remains that I should detect the same Identity or Uniformity of nature and properties to reside in all highly rectified Vinous Spirits which we have discoverd in Salts both fixt and volatil That Vinous spirits are only or at least chiefly the more subtle fine Oyles of Vegetables by fermentation broken into lesser parti cles and less branched than those which constitute the Oyles them selves will appear highly probable to him that shall duly consider the Manner of their production and seems demonstrable by divers obvious Experiments For the same quantity ofVegetables which being distilled with water no fermentation preceeding yields Oyl plentifully and little if any Vinous Spirit being distilled after a convenient time of Digestion and the addition of some proper Fer ment they afford store of Vinous spirits and if fully fermented there is little appearance of Oyl Also the same Herb fermented after its Oyl is extricated by the usual method yields a farr less proportion of Vinous spirits than when fermented before it was deprived of its Oyl That portion of the Oyl which is by the fermentation divided into lesser particles although not withstand ing this comminution they are accoridng to the Cartesian Hypo thesis branched enough to continue inflammable yet being mi nute do not affect the Palat after such different manners or make upon it such a variety of impressions as those that are occasio ned by impulses from the more gross Oleaginous particles Now if the smaller and more subtile matter which we shall henceforth calld Vinous Spirits being pressd by heat carry up and convey174 convey along with them some entire unbroken Oily parts or re ceive them that are capable of being elevated with the same de gree of heat by which they were raised these mixtures will retain somewhat of the most remarkable differences in Tast and sometimes Odour whereby the Vegetables themselves on their Oyls were discriminated But upon long frequent Digestions or reiterated Distillations these gross Oreaginous particles are either subdivided and thereby become Vinous spirits or that gentle equal degree of heat which is sufficient to elevate the more active volatil Vinous spirits cannot raise the more slug gish Oyles so that the Results are pure single homogeneous Vi nous spirits which whatsoever the Concretes were from whence they were derived though vastly differing from each other as also their Oyls out of which the Vinous spirits were more immediately produced yet the Spirits themselves thus purified are in Outward appearance similar and perhaps as perfectly simple and homogeneous as most substances in the Universe What I have deliverd is further confirmed by a more visible palpable Conversion of Vegetable Oyles into Vinous Spirits which I have effected in many and by Analogous operations I presume the same change may be superinduced upon all Pour upon an ounce of some common vegetable Essential Oyl two or three pound of Vinous spirit perfectly dephlegmed the greater quantity the more speedily is the transmutation or change performed The Spi rit will immediately upon simple agitation absorbe devour or dissolve the Oyl which by long digestion or reiterated cohobations may be totally devested of all those peculiar properties it en joyed whilst an Oyl and become perfectly Vinous never to be se parated in a distinct form or by any known diacritical sign or artifice to be discriminated from what hath in all appearance converted or transmuted it into its own nature or at least into a substance so like itself as to deserve the same denomination I shall here instead of a Conclusion impart unto you two very odd surprising Experiments which have some though remote relation unto the preceding Discoveries concerning Alcalizate and Volatile Salts Having procured a great quantity of Fernashes I extracted their Salt after the common method with water most of the water being evaporated I obtaind several pounds of Salt the greatest part whereof being first dried I exposed the remainder unto the Air that it might arrest some of the Vapors flitting in the same and thereby175 thereby became fluid which is commonly thoimproperly stiled an Oyl per deliquium The rest of the lixivium which continued fluid being siltered whilst warm was of a very red colour deeper than that of florid Blood or of most Clarets and exceeding pon derous The colour argued it abounding with Sulphureous or Oily parts and the weight that it was highly satiated with the Saline Having put this strong Solution into a capacious glass I either for got or neglected it five or six weeks and then looking after it my Eyes were unexpectedly saluted with a most pleasant spectacle which having arrested did immediately fix detain and employ them in the contemplation of an Object which did at once most charmingly invite and fully requite their greatest attention The Lixivium had deposited a large portion of the Salt it for merly contained part of which subsided I suppose immediately upon its cooling and several weeks of very cold weather ensu ing did occasion the Praecipitation of more So that accord ing to my estimation it was at least 2 inches thick over the bot tom of the Vessel The lowest part of the Salt was of a dark colour as if some earth dirt or dregs were admixt therewith The upper part or surface contiguous to the Liquor was exceeding white and there did arise or spring out of the whole mass of Salt at small di stance from eachother several Ibelieve40 branches which abating the colour did most exactly resemble that sort of Ferne which is single like Polypody and not branched sending out several leaves on each side from one stem Their magnitudes were divers but the figureso allwere were the same without the least variation only some e mitted more leaves from the stem than others which is also usual in the Natural Fern I preservd these Artificial regenerated or resus citated Vegetables many weeks in the same position not moving them they being of so tender a fabrick that the least motion of the Glass did hazard their disappearance Several persons were enter taind with this admirable Phaenomenon and enquiry being made before they were prepossessed with the foregoing Relation what Herb they did apprehend this pretty Phantasm represented did u nanimously refer it unto Fern But this agreeable Scene soonvanish ed for upon my return out of the Country where I then resided unto London although I had used all imaginable care and diligence to preserve them in their pristine beauty and integrity by agitation during the Journey or some other accident these pretty appearan ces were resolvd into the confused Chaos out of which they were educed Obs I176 Obs 1 The Fern was of a middle constitution between green and dry when burnt 2 It was imployed to dry Malt burnt in a Kiln with a close smothering heat 3 Therefore the Ashes yielded a far greater proportion of Salt than when the Herb is very dry and incinerated by a free open fire 4 From the same causes the Salt was not perfectly Alcalizate but plainly Tartareous and abounded with Oyl and Acid particles and therefore might properly enough be called an Essential Salt And upon fusion with a strong firewas much changed from a dark brown becoming white and was by the action of the fire much lessend in bulk the consequence of the avolation of Oyl Acidities and per haps other Substances during the operation of so strong a fire 5 That part of the impure Salt which as I before intimated was set to deliquatedid not as is usual become liquid but a perfect gel ly which could not by any method be afterwards reduced unto its saline form Which recals unto my mind what is deliverd by Kircher of his own personal experience in the Resuscitation of Plants who affirms that at some certain time of the opera tion the prepared Vegetable Substances appear in such a form The other Experiment concerning Volatil Salts succeeded after this manner Having occasion for Volatil Urinous Spirits for some ordinary uses I mixt equal parts of Sal Armoniac and Potashes which lat ter had a very strong sulphureous smell yet did seem to abound with Salt and that considerably Alcalized The mixture being put into a tall Glassbody immediately upon its feeling the heat plenty of a Volatil Salt sublimed from which I expected no unusual appearance having often repeated this operation with out observing any circumstance which deservd peculiar attention Being called from my Laboratory by some Company or Employ ment just as the Salt began to appear at my return I was amazed to see in the Glass head which was as the Cucurbit very spacious or capacious a Forest in perspective so admirably delineated as not to be excelled if imitated by the pencil of the greatest Ma sters in painting They were all not only to my apprehension but also in the Opinion of several Spectators ready to attest it Sha dows Rudiments Adumbrations or Representations of Firrs Pines and another sort of Tree which I cannot easily describe nor have I ever seen it growing wild or in gardens or in any Her bal exactly represented All these Images although very nume rous177 rous very reducible to one of these three species I do not re member that I have ever seen any more transportingly agreeable Appearance in any Chymical operation although it is well known that Chymistry doth daily present those who are very conversant with hera great number and variety of objects highly diverting for their prettiness and curiosity in colour figure and other acci dents But to return unto the forementiond Operation I am not igno rant that Volatil Salts do constantly shoot into variously and beau tifully shaped Crystals but I could never observe them regularor reducible unto a certain number of figures whereas in the Ope ration we have described the figures were first very different from any that ever appeard before or since upon Distillation of Com mixture and distillation of Potashes and SaltArmoniacalthoby me frequently repeated as neither upon the Distillation and Recti fication of Hartshorn Blood Urine Cranium humanum Salt Ar moniac with Lime SaltofTartarandother Alcalies Secondly The Figures were all reduciblein the Apprehension of every Spectator unto threekinds two of them commonly known and some of them were persons not easily bribed by fancy Howsoever had I been considerate and well advised I might have easily silenced doubt and detraction both by preserving the Glass containing this beautiful Scene which was prevented by my astonishment at and too greedy contemplation of so delicious a spectacle whereof to my great grief I was soon deprived by the Sublimationof more Salt which filling up the Intersticesdidtoge ther with the former case the Glass and retain no other Figure than the Concavity thereof allowd of The next day that great Virtuoso Sr Robert Moray whose memory can never be too much cherished nor his loss sufficient ly bewailed honouring me with a visit I acquainted him with the lately recited Accident who scrupled not though a rigid Philosopher to credit my Relation and to confirm me in the be lief that some certain governing principle might contribute towards the production of this Phaenomenon He affirmd that one Davison a famous and experienced Chymist at Paris had fre quently shewd him in a Glass a great company of Firrs and Pines which seemd no less lively and accurate than those produced by Painters are but such suspicions were soon stifled by their speedy disappearance and easie reproduction He also referrd me unto his Book of Chymical Operations where I find he makes mention of it A a as178 as a great artifice as really it was and makes it no less a mystery by concealing the process or manuals whereby it may be effectedon ly that nothing was emploied besides substances afforded by the trees which were represented and that the chief ingredient was Turpentine Herein his operation differd from that which I lately recited in that the substance out of which he raised those shapes was of a more Fixed Nature that which afforded mine Volatil to the highest degree He could constantly and regularly produce these Figures but mine did unexpectedly and fortuitously represent themselves un to my view neither do I ever again expect the like appearance Nor will I contend with him that shall af firm it was a mean Phantasme or a fortuitous Coalition of Salt in to such pretty figures But that they were not really such as I have related the most Satyrical Railleurs or most obstinate Scepticks shall never prevail upon me to recant and deny More Observations from Mr Leewenhookin a Letterof Sept7 1674 sent to the Publisher I Took saith he the Eye of a Cow and having with a great pin pierced the Cornea I found in the Aqueous humor which I took out some few crystallin globuls swimming The darkbrown co lour which I saw in this Eye did consist of dark gray globuls The Chrystallin Humor which in hardness almostresembles a Nut meg preservd I have with a razor cut asunder and observing it in parcels I found it to be made up of orbicular Scaly parts lying upon one another which had their beginning out of the Centerand did all consist of crystal in globuls After I had let this Chrystallin humor dry for three dayesit was grown so hard that when I put the knife to it it burst in pieces as if it had been hard rosin These pieces being by me viewd again I not only found in them the abovesaid or bicularScaly substance but also that every seale was composed again of circular parts and that these circles run contrary to the first like to a Globe made up of pa per to the uppermost part of which may resemble the outermost scale or plate of this Chrystallin substance underwhich uppermost Superfice there lyes another scale and so on continually unto the center of the globe This I take to be like the first orbicular scaly substance of which the Crystallin humor is made up The other round substance of which each scale is composed I see as if up on the mentiond Globe there were drawn lines close by one ano ther the first thereof passing through both poles and the others running along the sides thereof just as if the supersice of the globe were179 were compounded of such small parts as lines could be drawn up on a globe And I found all these particles to consist of crystallin globuls Two or three small pieces of this Crystallin body I have fixed to several pins of my Microscopes which I have laid by to shew them to the Curious upon occasion not being satisfied to see such things myself alone but very willing to present others with the same view although I have already found more than once that some have made their particular advantage by it Dr Swammerdam hath again within this fortnight visited me twiceaccompaniedwithaGentleman to both which I have shewd many of these Microscopical Observations and of such others as I had formerly spoken to him about perceiving that his speculati ons are busy upon this subjectand that probably he will discourse more largely of it than I have done hitherto To proceed having viewd the Vitrious humor lying deeper in the Eye I saw many more globuls than in the Aqueous which I took out from the top of the Eye The transparent Corneaafter I had let it dry for several days I viewd also and found it likewise to consist of crystallin globuls and endeavouring to sever the said tunicle in its thickness I found theglobulsthereofunitedsocloseand compact that the same seemd to consist of manifold sinewy particles crossing one another And how curiously soever I have hitherto endeavourd to view some of the Scaly parts yet I have not yet satisfied myself therein I ob servd only some streaks resembling the scars of a newly whetted rasor Mean time it seemd that this membrane would suffer separation when tis moist I formerly wrote to you that till then I had observd that all transparent and such particles as lye upon one another appeard to our Eye white The same I observe in the abovementiond Cry stallin liquor when dryed hard and then beat to pieces But when tis moist tis then not white In the second Tunicle of the Eye there appeard divers very fine glittering colours and it was blackand consisted also of globuls and viewing the single globuls I found them dark and passing my finger over this colourd membrane and the same being grown dry the colours were gone and the membrane was darker The third Tunicle was exceeding thin and tender and having viewed it I found it also to consist of globuls united I communicated these Observations to Doctor Scravesand and shewd him theCrystallin humor and he mentioning that some A a 2 Ana180 Anatomists affirmd the Optic Nerve to be hollowand that them selves had seen that hollowness thro which they would have the Animal spirits that convey the visible species represented in the eye pass into theBrainI thereupon concluded with myself that if there were such a cavity visible in that Nerve that it might also be seen by me especially since if it be so it must be pretty bigg and the body of it pretty stiff or else the circumjacent parts would press it together And in order to this discovery I sollicitously viewd three Optic Nerves of Cows but I could find no hol lowness in them I only took notice that they were made up of many filamentous particles of a very soft substance as if they only consisted of the corpuscles of the Brain joined toge ther the threds were so very soft and loose They were com posed of conjoined globuls and wound about again with par ticles consisting of other transparent globuls These Observations I likewiseimparted to the lately named Doc tor who thereupon encouraged me to proceed to others which made me to attempt a view of the sixt pair of Nerves calld par vagum cutting it off about the pipe in the Lungs of a Cow and finding it to consist of a very few filamentous particles com posed of globuls joined together which threaddy parts are very strong to which those of the Optic Nerve as to strength are not at all to be compared and they lay as wound about with a mat ter made up of pellucid globuls of which the small threds were composed Further that Nerve within was for the greatest part filled with globuls far bigger than those of which the Nervous parts were made up which filling globuls I can judge to be no thing else but Fatt And betwixt this Fatt and the Nervous fila ments I at first sawnowand then somehollowness which I esteemd might have been caused by the knife This I did with much sollici tude further inquire intowhereupon I found not only one hollow ness but as often as I cut the Nerve asunder the hollowness still continued therein and I found in some places not only one cavity but two or three cavities at once and where the cavity of the nerve was any thing bigg it was lined about with filmes as if they had been purposely contrived there to keep open those cavitys and to keep them from being compressed by the surrounding parts This cavity in the Nerve was also furnisht with a Tunicle asifit hadbeen a great Artery in proportion to the Nerve In the same Nerve I also saw several little Arteries running through But as to its strength that was but very slender not fit for any strong motion forasmuch181 forasmuch as I observd that besides the Tunicle it was in some places provided only with two or three threds and it was more over filled with fatt and had the beforementiond hollowness To pass on to other objects I have observed somewhat about Salt of which I took a little and put it on the brim of a Tin dish and so let it melt in my celler and having exposed that Brim to the hot Air or the Fire I had it turnd into Salt again and then found that some of thoseSaline parts consisted of globulsothers of Conical smooth particles others were pyramidal and smooth some perfectly quadrangular and smooth some longways qua drangular in both of which latter I saw again some very small squares Moreover I have also viewed some of the english Earth which is yellowish and some that is of a deeper yellow then that which is found between Harwich and Londonandwherewith someLand is only as twere coverd Which yellowish Earth our Potters of Porcelanware make use of when they want that Flamish Earth that is got about Tournay This English Earth I found to be made up of very fine globuls which by my estimate I judged to be many thousand times smaller than a common grain of sandafter a Geo metrical computation by which the axis of a grain of Sand is ma ny hundred times bigger than the axis of one of the particles which compose the said English Earth I have likewise examind the lately mentiond Flamish Earth which I found to consist of globuls yet somewhat smaller than those of the English Earth Again viewing that sort of Earth which we call Clay of which there is a great store about this Town of Delst and elsewhere in this Country that is made up of yet smaller globuls than both the fore going sorts and tis by our Porcelanmakers calld Black Earth being of a dark gray colour The globuls of this Earth are not so heavy as those of the described English and Flamish Earth and tis easily changed into Glass and they make very strong Pots of the same But being bakd tis red and therefore not fit for Por celans but tis blended with the English and Flamish Earth to give a strong and good sound to our Porcelan Mean while I did not find this black Earth so pure as the other it being mixt with o ther particles which I did not think to be Earth but rather esteemd them to be rotten wood mixed with sand and sandy particles that were above a hundred times smaller than sand About two Leagues from this Town there lyes an InlandSea called182 called BerkelseSea whose bottom in many places is verymoorish This water is in Winter very clear but about beginning or in the midst of Summer it grows whitishand there are then small green clouds permeating it which the Countrymendwelling near it fay is caused from the Dews then falling and call it Henydew This water is abounding in Fish which is very good and savoury Pas sing lately over this Sea at a time when it blew a fresh gale of wind and observing the water as above described I took up some of it in a Glassvessel which having viewd the next day I found moving in it several Earthy particles and some green streaks spirally ranged after the manner of the Copper or Tinworms used by Distillers to cool their distilled waters and the whole compass of each of these streaks was about the thickness of a manshair on his head Other particles had but the beginning of the said streak all consisting of small green globuls interspersed among all which there crawled abundance of little animals someof which were roundish those thatwere somewhat bigger than others were of an Oval figure On these latter I saw two legs near the head and two little fins on the other end of their body Others were somewhat larger than an Oval and these were very slow in their motion and few in number These animalcula had divers co lours some being whitish others pellucid others had green and very shing little scales others again were green in the middle and before and behind white others grayish And the motion of most of them in the water was so swiftand so variousupwards downwardsand round aboutthat I confess I could not but won der at it I judge that some of these little creatures were above a thousand times smaller than the smallest oneswhich I have hi therto seen in chees wheaten flower mould and the like

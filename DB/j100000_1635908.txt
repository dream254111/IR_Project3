the close of a reign which has prac tically coincided with the first decade of a new century it is natural to look back and summarize the progress of geography dur ing the decade At the beginning of a new reign it is equally natural to consider the future Our new sovereign is one of the most traveled of men No monarch knows the world as he knows it no mon arch has ruled over a larger empire or seen more of his dominions His advice has been to wake up to consider and to act It will be in consonance with this advice if I pay more attention to the geography of the future than to that of the past and say more about its applications than about its origins Yet I do so with some reluctance for the last decade has been one of the most active and interesting in the history of our science The measurement of new and the remeasurement of old arcs will give us bet ter data for determining the size and shape of the earth Surveys of all kinds from the simple route sketches of the traveler to the elaborate cadastral surveys of some of the more populous and settled regions 1Address to the Geographical Section of the British Association for the Advancement of Sci ence Sheffield 1910 have so extended our knowledge of the surface features of the earth that a map on the scale of 1000000 is not merely planned but actually partly executed Such surveys and such maps are the indis pensable basis of our science and I might say much about the need for accurate topo graphical surveys This however has been done very fully by some of my predecessors in this chair in recent years The progress of oceanography has also been great The soundings of our own and other admiralties of scientific oceanograph ical expeditions and those made for the purpose of laying cables have given us much more detailed knowledge of the ir regularities of the ocean floor An inter national map of oceanic contours due to the inspiration and munificence of the prince of oceanographers and of Monaco has been issued during the decade and so much new material has accumulated that it is now being revised A comparison of the old and new editions of Kriimmels Ozeanographie shows us the immense advances in this subject Great progress has been made on the geographical side of meteorology and climate The importance of this knowl edge for tropical agriculture and hygiene has led to an increase of meteorological stations all over the hot beltthe results of which will be of immense value to the geographer Mr Bartholomews Atlas of Meteorology appeared at the beginning and Sir John Eliots Meteorological Atlas of India at the end of the decade Dr Hanns Lehrbuch and the new edition of his Climatology  Messrs Hilde brandsson and Teisserene de Borts great work The Study of the Upper Atmo sphere are among the landmarks of progress The record is marred only by the closing of Ben Nevis Observatory A comparison of the present number and dis 742 SCIENCE743 SCIENCE NOVEMBER 25 1910 tribution of meteorological stations with those given in Bartholomews atlas would show how great the extension of this work is I have not time to recapitulate the in numerable studiesof geographical value issued by many meteorological services observatories and observerspublic and privatebut I may call attention to the improved weather maps and to the excel lent pilot charts of the North Atlantic and of the Indian Ocean published monthly by our Meteorological Office Lake studies have also been a feature of this decade and none are so complete or so valuable as the Scottish Lakes Survey a work of national importance undertaken by private enthusiasm and generosity We have to congratulate Sir John Murray and Mr Pullar on the completion of a great work In geology I might note that we now possess a map of Europe on a scale of 11500000 prepared by international co operation and also one of North America on a smaller scale The thanks and con gratulations of all geographers are due to Professor Suess on the conclusion of his classical study of the face of the earth the first comprehensive study of the main divi sions and characteristics of its skeleton English readers are indebted to Professor and Miss Sollas for the brilliant English translation which they have prepared A new movement inspired mainly by Professor Flahault in France Professor Geddes in this country Professors Engler Drude and Schimper in Germany has arisen among botanists and at last we have some modern botanical geography which is really valuable to the geographer I wish we could report similar progress in zoolog ical geography but that I trust will come in the next decade I pass over the various expensive arbi trations and commissions to settle boun dary disputes which have in many cases been due to geographical ignorance also the importantl and fascinating problems of the growth of our knowledge of the dis tribution of economic products and powers existing and potential and the new geo graphical problems for statesmen due to the industrial revolution in Japan and China It is quite impossible to deal with the exploration of the decade Even in the past two years we have had Peary and Shackleton Stein and Hedin the Duke of the Abruzzi and a host of others returning to tell us of unknown or little known parts of the globe We hope to hear some of the results of latest investigations from Dr Charcot We wish success to Scott and his com panions to Bruce Amundsen Filchner and others British American German or whatever nationality who go to the south or north polar ice worlds to Longstaff Bruce and others exploring the Himalayan regions and to other geographical expedi tions too numerous to mention One word of caution may perhaps be permitted There is a tendency on the part of the public to confuse geographical ex ploration and sport The newspaper re porter naturally lays stress on the unusual in any expedition the accidental rather than the essential and those of us who have to examine the work of expeditions know how some have been unduly boomed be cause of some adventurous element while others have not received adequate popular recognition because all went well The fact that all went well is in itself a proof of competent organization There is no excuse for us in this section if we fall into the journalists mistake and we shall cer tainly be acting against the interests ofN S VOL XXXII No 830 both our science and our section if we do so It was not my intention in this address to raise the question of what is geography but various circumstances make it desir able to say a few words upon it We are all the victims of the geographical teach ing of our youth and it is easy to under stand how those who have retained un changed the conceptions of geography they gained at school many years ago cavil at the recognition of geography as a branch of science Moreover the geography of the schools still colors the conceptions of some geographers who have nevertheless done much to make school geography scientific and educational Many definitions of geography are consequently too much limited by the arbitrary but traditional division of school subjects In schools tra dition and practical convenience have on the whole rightly determined the scope of the different subjects Geography in schools is best defined as the study of the earth as the home of man its limits should not be too closely scrutinized and it should be used freely as a coordinating subject The present division into sections of the British association is also largely a matter of practical convenience but we are told that the present illogical arrangement of sections distresses some minds No doubt there are some curious anomalies The most glaring perhaps is that of combining mathematics with physicsas if mathe matical methods were used in no other subjects There is a universal tendency to sub division and an everincreasing specialism but there is also an evergrowing interde pendence of different parts of science which the British Association is unques tionably bound to take into account At present this is chiefly done by joint meet ings of sections a wise course of which this section has been one of the chief pro moters It is possible that some more sys tematic grouping of sections might be well advised but such a reform should be sys tematic and not piecemeal It is one which raises the whole question of the classifica tion of knowledge This is so vast a prob lem and one on which such divergent opinions are held that I must apologize for venturing to put forward some tentative suggestions It might be found desirable to take as primary divisions the mathematical phys ical biological anthropological and geo graphical groups Statistics might be re garded as a subdivision of mathematics or as a field common to mathematics and any of the other groups In the second might be the subdivisions physics and chemistry Each would devote a certain proportion of time to its applied aspectsor there might be subsections on physics which would in clude engineering and applied chemistry In the biological group there would be botany zoology in both cases including paleontology and embryology and applied biology which would be dealt with in one or other of the ways I have suggested and would inciude agriculture fisheries etc Medicine we leave out at present In the psychological group there would be a new section on psychology with the education section as the practical appendage Mathe matical application would be considered in each of the other sections which use mathe matical notations In the anthropological group there would be the present anthro pology and theoretical economics with ap plied economics and administration In the geographical group there would be geography and geology the practical ap plications of geography being considered in joint meetings or subsectionsfor in stance geography and physics for ques tions of atmospheric and oceanic circula SCIENCE 744NOVEMBER 25 1910 tion geography and economics for ques tions of transportation etc So much then for the classification of geography with reference to the other sciences I should like to say a few words about geographical classification and geo graphical terminology In the scheme of the universe it is pos sible to consider the earth as a unit with its own constitution and history It has an individuality of its own though for the astronomer it is only one example of a particular type of heavenly bodies As geographers we take it as our unit indi vidual in the same way that an anatomist takes a man We see that it is composed of different parts and we try to discover what these are of what they are composed what their function is what has been their history The fundamental division is into land water and air Each has its forms and its movements The forms are more ob vious and persistent in the land They are least so in the atmosphere though forms existsome of which are at times made visible by clouds and many can be clearly discerned on isobaric charts The land is the temporarily permanent the water and atmosphere the persistently mobile the latter more so than the former The stable forms of the land help to control the dis tribution and movements of the waters and to a less extent those of the atmosphere How great the influence of the distribution of land and water is on the atmosphere may be seen in the monsoon region of eastern Asia We can analyze and classify the subdi vision of the land the water and the atmo sphere Each has given rise to a special branch of study Geomorphology deals with the forms of the land and their shapinggeomorph ology oceanography and climatology Three things have to be kept clearly in view i the structure including the composition of the more permanent sub stance of the form ii the forces which are modifying it and iii the phase in the cycle of forms characteristic of such structure acted on by such forms We may say that any form is a function of struc ture process and time The matter is even more complicated for we have in stances e g in antecedent drainage sys tems of the conditions of a previous cycle affecting a subsequent onea kind of heredity of forms which can not be neglected The geomorphologist is seeking for a genetic classification of forms and in the works of Davis Penck Richtofen and Su pan and their pupils are being accumu lated the materials for a more complete and systematic classification of forms As you all know the question of terms for the manifold landforms is a difficult one and apt to engender much more controversy than the analysis of the forms themselves I have long thought that we shall be driven to some notation analogous to that of the chemists I have not yet had time to work such a notation out in detail but it might take the form of using different symbols for the three factors noted above say letters for different kinds of struc ture and say Arabic figures for processes and Roman figures for the stage of a cycle the form has reached Take a very simple set of structures and indicate each by a letter rhomogeneous r horizontal Structure A layered tilted I folded mixed A A B B C C D IY h E If pervious or impervious a p or an i could be addede g a tilted limestone with faults would be Cp SCIENCE 745N S  OLXXXII No 830 Next indicate the commoner erosion processes by Arabic numerals ice 2 Process wind 3 Proces wind  3 sea  4 One process may have followed another e g where a long period of ice erosion has been followed by water erosion we might write 21 where these alternate annually say 21 The phase of the cycle might be denoted by Roman figures A scale of V might be adopted and I III and V used for youth ful middleaged and oldaged as Professor Davis calls them or early middle and late phases as I shall prefer to term them II and IV would denote intermediate stages A scarped limestone ridge in a relatively nmature phase like the Cotswolds would be if we put the process first1i C1 III a highland like the southern Uplands of Scotland would be denoted by the formula 1 21 E1 III This is the roughest suggestion but it shows how we could label our cases of notes and pigeonhole our types of forms and prevent for the present undue quar relling over terms No doubt there would be many discussions about the exact phase of the cycle for example whether ice in addition to water has been an agent in shaping this or that form But after all these discussions would be more profitable than quarrels as to which descriptive term or place name or local usage should be adopted to distinguish it In the case of climatology there is com ing to be a general consensus of opinion as to what are the chief natural divisions and the use of figures and letters to indi eate them has been followed by several authors This should also be attempted for oceanography If any international agreement of sym bols and colors could be come to for sueh things it would be a great gain and I hope to bring this matter before the next inter national geographical congress We have still to come to geography itself What are the units smaller than the whole earth with which our science has to deal When we fix our attention on parts of the earth and ask what is a natural unit we are hampered by preconceptions We recognize species or genera families or races as unitsbut they are abstract rather than concrete units Speaking for myself I should say that every visible con crete natural uniton the earths surface consisting of more than one organic indi vidual is a geographical unit It is a com mon difficulty not to be able to see the wood for the trees it is still more difficult to recognize that the wood consists of more than trees that it is a complex of trees and other vegetation fixed to a definite part of the solid earth and bathed in air The family the species and the race are abstract ideas If we consider them as units it is because they have a certain his torical continuity They have not an ac tual physical continuity as the component parts of an individual have Concrete physical continuity is what differentiates the geographical unit We may speak of a town or state as composed of people but a complete conception of either must include the spacial connections which unite its parts A town is not merely an associa tion of individuals nor is it simply a piece of land covered with streets and buildings it is a combination of both In determining the greater geographical units man need not be taken into account We are too much influenced by the mobil ity of man by his power to pass from one region to another and we are apt to forget that his influence on his environment is 746 SCIENCENOVEMBER 25 1910 747 negligible except when we are dealing with relatively small units The geographer will not neglect man he will merely be careful to prevent himself from being un duly influenced by the human factor in selecting his major units Some geographers and many geologists have suggested that land forms alone need be taken into account in determining these geographical units Every different recog nizable land form is undoubtedly a geo graphical unit A great mountain system such as that of western North America or a vast lowland such as that which lies to the east of the Rocky Mountains is un doubtedly a geographical unit of great im portance but its subdivisions are not wholly orographical The shores of the Gulf of Mexico can not be considered as similar geographically to those of the Arctic Ocean even if they are morpholog ically homologous I wish to lay great stress on the significance of vegetation to the geographer for the purposes of regional classification I do not wish to employ a biological terminology nor to raise false analogies between the individual organism and the larger units of which it is a part but I think we should do well to consider what may be called the life or movement going on in our units as well as their form We must consider the seasonal changes of its atmospheric and of its water move ments as well as the parts of the earths crust which they move over and even slightly modify For this purpose a study of climatic regions is as necessary as a study of morphological regions The low lands of the Arctic area are very different from those at or near the tropics The rhythm of their life is different and this difference is revealed in the differences of vegetation By vegetation I mean not the flora the historically related elements but the veg etable coating the spacerelated elements Vegetation in this sense is a geographical phenomenon of fundamental importance It indicates qualityquality of atmos phere and quality of soil It is a visible synthesis of the climatic and edaphic ele ments Hence the vast lowlands of rela tively uniform land features are properly divided into regions according to vegeta tiontundra pine forest deciduous forest warm evergreen forest steppe and scrub Such differences of vegetation are full of significance even in mountainous areas The search after geographical unity after general features common to recog nizable divisions of the earths surface the analysis of these their classification into types the comparisons between different examples of the typesseem to me among the first duties of a geographer Two sets of maps are essentialtopographical and vegetationalthe first giving the super ficial topography and as far as possible its surface irregularities the latter indicating quality of climate and soil Much has been said in recent years more particularly from this presidential chairon the need for reliable topograph ical maps Without such maps no others can be made But when they are being made it would be very easy to have a gen eral vegetational map compiled Such maps are even more fundamental than geological maps and they can be con structed more rapidly and cheaply Every settled country and more particularly every partially settled country will find them invaluable if there is to be any intelli gent and systematic utilization of the products of the country The geographers task I am assuming is to study environments to examine the forms and qualities of the earths surface and to recognize define and classify the different kinds of natural units into which SCIENCEN S VOL XXXII No 830 it can be divided For these we have not as yet even names It may seem absurd that there should be this want of terms in a subject which is associated in the minds of most people with a superfluity of names I haver elsewhere suggested the use of the terms major natural region natural re gion district and locality to represent dif ferent grades of geographical units and have also attempted to map the seventy or eighty major natural regions into which the earths surface is divided and to classify them into about twenty types These tentative divisions will necessarily become more accurate as research proceeds and the minor natural regions into which each major natural region should be di vided will be definitely recognized de scribed and classified Before this can be done however the study of geomorphology and of plant formations must be carried far beyond the present limits At the opposite end of the scale that is in the geographical study of localities good work is beginning to be done Dr H R Mill one of the pioneers of geography in this country and one of my most distin guished predecessors in this chair has given us in his study of southwest Sussex an admirable example of a geographical monograph proper which takes into ac count the whole of the geographical factors involved He has employed quantitative methods as far as these could be applied and in doing so has made a great step in advance Quantitative determinations are at least as essential in geographical re search as the consideration of the time factor The geomorphologist and the sociologist have also busied themselves with particu lar aspects of selected localities Professor W M Davis of Harvard has published geomorphological monographs which are invaluable as models of what such work should be In a number of cases he has passed beyond mere morphology and has called attention to the organic responses associated with each land form Some of the monographs published under the super vision of the late Professor Ratzel of Leip zig bring out very clearly the relation be tween organic and inorganic distributions and some of the monographs of the Le Play school incidentally do the same At present there is a double need Re search may take the form in the first place of collecting new information or in the second place of working up the ma terial which is continually being accumu lated The first taskthat of collecting new in formationis no small one In many cases it must be undertaken on a scale that can be financed only by governments The ordnance and geological surveys of our own and other countries are examples of government departments carrying on this work We need more of them We need urgently a hydrographical department which would cooperate with Dr Mills rainfall organization It would be one of the tasks of this department to extend and coordinate the observations on river and lake discharge which are so important from an economic or health point of view that various public bodies have had to make such investigations for the drainage areas which they control Such research work as that done by Dr Strahan for the Exe and Medway would be of the greatest value to such a department which ought to prepare a map showing all existing water rights public and private We shall see how serious the absence of such a department is if we consider how our water supply is limited and how much of it is not used to the best advantage We must know its average quantity and the ex treme variations of supply We must also 748 SCIENCENOVEMBER 25 1910 know what water is already assigned to the uses of persons and corporations and what water is still available We shall have to differentiate between water for the per sonal use of man and animals and water for industrial purposes The actualities and the potentialities can be ascertained and should be recorded and mapped In the second direction of researchthat of treating from the geographical stand point the data accumulated whether by government departments or by private initiativework has as yet hardly been be gun The topographical work of the ordnance survey is the basis of all geographical work in our country The survey has is sued many excellent maps none more so than the recently published halfinch con toured and hillshaded maps with colors in layers Its maps are not all above criticism for instance few can be ob tained for the whole kingdom having pre cisely the same symbols It has not under taken some of the work that should have been done by a national cartographic serv icefor instance the lake survey Nor has it yet done what the geological survey has donepublished descriptive accounts of the facts represented on each sheet of the map From every point of view this is a great defect but in making these criti cisms we must not forget a that the treasury is not always willing to find the necessary money and b that the ordnance survey was primarily made for military purposes and that the latest map it has issued has been prepared for mili tary reasons It has been carried out by men who were soldiers first and topograph ers after and did not necessarily possess geographical interests The ideal geo graphical map with its accompanying geographical memoir can be produced only by those who have had a geographical training Dr Mill in the monograph already referred to has shown us how to prepare systematized descriptions of the oneinch map sheets issued by the ordnance survey At Oxford we are continuing Dr Mills work We require our diploma students to select some district shown on a sheet of this map for detailed study by means of map measurements an examination of sta tistics and literature which throw light on the geographical conditions and above all by field work in the selected district Every year we are accumulating more of these district monographs which ought in their turn to be used for compiling re gional monographs dealing with the larger natural areas In recent years excellent examples of such regional monographs have come from France and from Ger many The preparation of such monographs would seem to fall within the province of the ordnance survey If this is impossible the American plan might be adopted There the geological survey which is also a topographical one is glad to obtain the services of professors and lecturers who are willing to undertake work in the field dur ing vacations It should not be difficult to arrange similar cooperation between the universities and the ordnance survey in this country At present the schools of geography at Oxford and at the London School of Economics are the only univer sity departments which have paid atten tion to the preparation of such mono graphs but other universities will probably fall into line Both the universities and the ordnance survey would gain by such cooperation The chief obstacle is the ex pense of publication This might reason ably be made a charge on the ordnance survey on condition that each monograph published were approved by a small corn 1749 SCIENCESCIENCE mittee on which both the universities and the ordnance survey were represented The information which many other gov ernment departments are accumulating would also become much more valuable if it were discussed geographically Much excellent geographical work is done by the admiralty and the war office The meteor ological office collects statistics of the weather conditions from a limited number of stations but its work is supplemented by private societies which are not well enough off to discuss the observations they publish with the detail which these obser vations deserve The board of agriculture and fisheries has detailed statistical in formation as to crops and live stock for the geographer to work up From the board of trade he would obtain industrial and commercial data and from the local government board vital and other demo graphic statistics At present most of the information of these departments is only published in statistical tables Statistics are all very well but they are usually published in a tabular form which is the least intelligible of all Statistics should be mapped and not merely be set out in columns of figures Many dull blue books would be more interesting and more widely used if their facts were properly mapped I say properly mapped because most examples of socalled statistical maps are merely crude diagrams and are often actually misleading It requires a knowl edge of geography in addition to an under standing of statistical methods to prepare intelligible statistical maps If Mr Bosses maps of population of England and Wales in Bartholomews survey atlas are com pared with ordinary ones the difference be tween a geographical map and a carto graphic diagram will be easily appreciated The coming census and to a certain ex tent the census of production and prob ably the new land valuation will give more vraluable raw material for geographical treatment If these are published merely in tabular form they will not be studied by any but a few experts Give a geog rapher with a proper staff the task of mapping them in a truly geographical way and they will be eagerly ex amined even by the man in the street who can not fail to learn from them The presentation of the true state of the coun try in a clear graphic and intelligible form is a patriotic piece of work which the gov ernment should undertake It would add relatively little to the cost of the census and it would infinitely increase its value The double lackthe lacune in the in formation and the absence of adequate geographical treatment of such material as there ismakes the task of studying the huge natural divisions which we call con tinents a very difficult and unsatisfactory one For several years in Oxford we have been trying to gather together the material available for the study of the continents and to make as accurate maps as is possible for geographical purposes We have adopted uniform scales and methods and by using equal area projections we have obtained comparative graphic representa tions of the facts We hope before the end of the year to issue maps of physical fea tures vegetation and rainfall of each con tinent and other maps for the world These are being measured and I hope will yield more reliable quantitative informa tion about the world and its continents than we possess at present With such quantitative information and with a fuller analysis of the major natural regions it ought to be possible to go a step further and to attempt to map the economic value of different regions at the present day Such maps would necessarily be only approximations at first Out of 750 N S VOL XXXII No 830NOVEMBER 25 1910 them might grow other maps prophetic of economic possibilities Prophecy in the scientific sense is an important outcome of geographical as well as of other scientific research The test of geographical laws as of others is the pragmatic one Prophecy is commonly but unduly derided Men delyeff s period law involved prophecies which have been splendidly verified We no longer sneer at the weather prophet Efficient action is based on knowledge of cause and consequence and proves that a true forecast of the various factors has been made Is it too much to look forward to the time when the geographical prospector the geographer who can estimate potential geographical values will be as common as and more reliable than the mining pros pector  The day will undoubtedly come when every government will have its geograph icalstatistical department dealing with its own and other countriesan information bureau for the administration correspond ing to the department of special inquiries at the board of education There is no geographical staff to deal geographically with economic matters or with administra tive matters Yet the recognition of and proper estimation of the geographical fac tor is going to be more and more important as the uttermost ends of the earth are bound together by visible steel lines and steel vessels or invisible impulses which require no artificial path or vessel as their vehicle The development of geographical re search along these lines in our own country could give us an intelligence department of the kind which is much needed If this were also done by other states within the empire an imperial intelligence depart ment would gradually develop Thinking in continents to borrow an apt phrase from one of my predecessors might then become part of the necessary equipment of a statesman instead of merely an after dinner aspiration The country which first gives this training to its statesmen will have an immeasurable advantage in the struggle for existence Our universities will naturally be the places where the men fit to constitute such an intelligence department will be trained It is encouraging therefore to see that they are taking up a new attitude towards geography and that the civil service com missioners by making it a subject for the highest civil service examinations are doing much to strengthen the hands of the universities When the British Association last met in Sheffield geography was the most despised of school subjects and it was quite unknown in the universities It owed its first recognition as a subject of university status to the generous financial support of the Royal Geographical Society and the brilliant teaching of Mr Mackinder at Oxford Ten years ago schools of geography were struggling into existence at Oxford and Cambridge under the auspices of the Royal Geographical Society A single decade has seen the example of Oxford and Cambridge followed by nearly every university in Great Britain the Uni versity of Sheffield among them In Dr Rudmore Brown it has secured a traveler and explorer of exceptionally wide experi ence who will doubtless build up a depart ment of geography worthy of this great industrial capital The difficulty however in all universities is to find the funds nec essary for the endowment equipment and working expenses of a geographical depart ment of the first rank Such a department requires expensive instruments and appa ratus and since the geographer has to take the whole world as his subject it must spend largely on collecting storing and utilizing raw material of the kind I have 751 SCIENCEN S VOL XXXII No 830 spoken of Moreover a professor of geog raphy should have seen much of the world before he is appointed and it ought to be an important part of his professional duties to travel frequently and far I have never been able to settle to my own satisfaction the maximum income which a department of geography might usefully spend but I have had considerable experience of work ing a department with an income not very far above the minimum Till this year the Oxford School of Geography has been obliged to content itself with three rooms and to make these suffice not merely for lecturerooms and laboratories but also for housing its large and valuable collection of maps and other materials This collec tion is far beyond anything which any other university in this country possesses but it shrinks into insignificance beside that of a rich and adequately supported geographical department like that of the University of Berlin This fortunate de partment has an income of about 60001 a year and an institute built specially for its requirements at a cost of over 1500001 excluding the site In Oxford we are only too grateful that the generosity of Mr Bailey of Johannesburg has enabled the school of geography to add to its accom modation by renting for five years a private house in which there will temporarily be room for our students and for our collec tions but where we can never hope to do what we might if we had a building speci ally designed for geographical teaching and research Again Lord Brassey and Mr Douglas Freshfield a former presi dent of this section have each generously offered 5001 towards the endowment of a professorship if other support is forthcom ing All this is matter for congratulation but I need hardly point out that a pro fessor with only a precarious income for his department is a person in a far from enviable position There is at present no permanent working income guaranteed to any geographical department in the coun try and so long as this is the case the work of all these departments will be hampered and the training of a succession of competent men retarded I do not think that I can conclude this brief address bet ter than by appealing to those princes of industry who have made this great city what it is to provide for the geographical department of their university on a scale which shall make it at once a model and a stimulus to every other university in the country and to all benefactors of univer sities A J HERBERTSON UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES WE learn from a report in the New York Evening Post that the Association of Amer ican Universities met at the University of Virginia last week Three papers were pre sented by delegates The first by President Bryan of Indiana University was on  Allow ing Credit for Professional Work to Count toward the Degree of Bachelor of Arts President Bryan is in favor of allowing stu dents to complete requirements for this de gree in a standard college of arts and sciences and in a professional school in seven years where the professional course requires four years and in six years where the professional course requires three also of granting two degrees when the work for them has been done simultaneously but separately Emphasis was laid upon the statement that there should be no discrimination against colleges connected with universities The second paper by Professor Calvin Thomas The Degree of Master of Arts defended the two propositions that work for this degree should require intensive work in one study for at least one year and that the candidate should have a bachelors degree 752 SCIENCE

common law rule Ob viously in states which have adopted the test of reasonable user such an exception finds no place since reasonableness is not deter mined per se but in the light of surrounding circumstances and the rights of other proprietors14 In a recent Vermont case Lawrie v Silsby 1909 74 Atl 94 the court therefore in denying injunc tive relief properly refused to regard interference by one riparian proprietor with the use of the water by another for domestic purposes unreasonable per se The court had previously repudiated the doctrine of an absolute right in the water for domestic purposes15 Ordinarily for the infringement of riparian rights an injunction will issue as of course although such relief will be denied if it will not in fact grant substantial reliefl This certainly should be the result where there is damage or destruction of property and balance of convenience would prevent injunctive relief only if the interfer ence has been merely with comfortable enjoyment This distinction is sometimes drawn where property rights are infringed by a nuis ance18 The cases in which an injunction is denied although damage is proved are possibly reconcilable on this ground9 Apparently to avoid the issuance of an injunction as a matter of right some courts have in the public interest conceded to a city the right to pollute a river with its sewage20 and to a mine owner the right to pollute a stream with mine water 21 without liability in law or equity for the damage resulting to lower riparian proprietors This however seems a judicial expropriation of property and is not looked on with favor by many courts22 In jurisdictions in which reasonable user is the test the primary question is the infringement of the plaintiffs right for which infringement it would seem the plaintiff may secure an injunction However under this test the denial of injunctive relief may often be justified since the balance of convenience in a given case is a potent factor in the determination of the plaintiffs right INCOMPATIBLE AND FORBIDDEN OFFICESIn most states constitu tional or statutory clauses declare that certain offices called for bidden shall not be accepted by incumbents of other offices Such provisions arise from obvious considerations of policy For them to operate the title to the office already held must be de jure and not simply de factol and the fact that a person is holding over and per forming the duties of his office until his successor has qualified does Pitts v Lancaster Mills Mass I847 I3 Metc 156 Lawrie v Silsby supra Atty Gen v Birmingham

LAW REVIEW not in itself disqualify him2 Offices which are purely local in their operation are not affected by such statutes and accordingly municipal offices do not generally fall within the prohibition3 though county offices do4 Where however the municipal office has more than purely local functions or the state officer could control or influence it the concurrent holding of the two offices is forbidden5 The prohibition takes effect not at the election but at the qualification for the forbidden office and it would appear that if the time for qualifying for the second office were after the end of the term of the first its incumbent could hold the second even though the election took place previous to the termination of the first6 Where it is declared that an officer shall not be eligible to a certain office an attempted acceptance of it has no effect and the first office is retained7 but where the statute reads that the two offices may not be held the acceptance of the latter acts ipso facto as a surrender of the former8 This follows the rule of the common law that the acceptance of an incompatible office acts as instantaneous surrender of the first9 and that no proceedings are necessary to vacate it1 although the officer is still its de facto in cumbent whose acts are valid as regards third partiesl1 This rule is applied even where the office surrendered is superior to the one accepted and even though the second office is held under a void election and the title to it has failed13 An appointment however to an office which a person is absolutely ineligible to hold is void and does not work a forfeiture of the first office1 To the general rule that the acceptance of an incompatible office acts as a surrender of the first there is an exception that when the first office is one from which the party cannot resign by his own independent act he must retain the old office and cannot accept the new15 Where however the appointing power is given to the same body which may accept the resignation the general rule appliess The reason for this rule seems to be that by accepting the second office the officer has impliedly made an election to give up the first and this theory is apparently sub stantiated by the cases which hold that a person legally in possession of two offices later made incompatible may choose which he will holdl State v Somers

that a person elected at the same meeting to two incompatible offices takes the one for which he first qualifies1s Logically it would seem that where a state prohibition exists against the concurrent holding of a state and a federal office and a federal officer accepts a state office that this would ipso facto act as a sur render of the federal office it being assumed that it is one from which he could divest himself at his own election As a matter of law and policy however it is generally held that a federal officer is not eligible to accept a state officel0 and that he cannot remove this disqualifica tion by resigning unless such resignation precedes his appointment to the state office20 On the other hand the acceptance by a state officer of a federal office acts at once as a surrender of the state office21 This result is probably reached on principles of public policy and because the state having no jurisdiction over a federal officer could not remove him so that it might become possible for a person to hold without molestation two offices absolutely prohibited by the state constitution22 Where no statutes forbid it offices may be held both under the federal and state governments if not incompatible at common law23 Such incompatibility it has been well settled does not consist in mere physical impossibility to perform24 there must be an incon sistency in functions so that one would hinder or influence the opera tions of the other25 It seems a fair question however whether when the offices are such that they cannot be executed at the same time and no deputy can be appointed they are not so opposed to each other as to be incompatible In a recent case State v Gebert Oh 0 C 1909 54 Oh Law Bull No 48 the court unhampered by any statutes or pro visions of the state constitution held the offices of mayor and federal congressman compatible It therefore followed logically that an ac ceptance of the position of congressman did not deprive the defendant of the

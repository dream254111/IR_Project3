Abstract,i207044,103 Since thoose imeasurements the author has obtained another section extending from Namthabad to Daumergidda in the Nizams do minions which being in latitude 180 3 236 gives a total arc of 90 531 4514 in amplitude From the first of these sections Colonel Lambton finds the length of the degree due to latitude 90 34 44 the middle point of that arc equal to 60472 83 fathoms The second section whose middle point is in latitude 13 2 55 gives the mean degree equal to 60487 56 fathoms and the last section gives the degree equal to 6051278 fathoms due to the latitude of 16 34 42 the middle point of that section The author proceeds to compare eaclh of these degrees first with the French measure then with the English and lastly with the Swedish measure and thence obtains a general mean for the com pression at the poles The first mean of these three degrees used with the French degree gives the compression OT the second mean of the same three degrees used with the English degree gives Tr and the third mean of these three degrees used with the Swedish degree gives T so that the mean of these three means will give the compression 6 or g3 nearly of the polar axis The number of base lines in this extensive arc are five all mea sured with the chain extended in coffers with elevating screws c The author after giving a variety of data proceeds to investigate the formulae which he has employed in his calculations and concludes with a table of the lengths of different degrees for every third degree from the equator to the pole The Croonian Lecture On the Conversion of Pus into Granulations or New Flesh By Sir Everard Home Bart VPRS Read No vember 5 1818 Phil Trans 1819 p 1 The changes which pus undergoes in the formation of new flesh are so analogous to those which take place in the blood and which were discussed in the authors Croonian lecture of last year that he is induced to consider the two fluids as possessed of the same pro perties the colour of the globules being the principal characteristic distinction between them That pus is a transparent fluid in which globules are subsequently formed was proved by the author in 1788 and in July 1817 Mr Bauer observed the same property in the serum of the blood he saw globules forming in that fluid while he was examining it in the field of the microscope Human blood sheeps blood and calves blood presented to Sir Everard similar results the serum of which when warm and fresh was observed in a space covering Ti0oth part of an inch to produce from six to twelve globules in a few minutes two only being observed in the first instance The author after detailing further experiments on the formation of globules in the serum of the blood proceeds to examine the changes which happen in pus upon the surface of a sore having previously104 described the appearancee of the surface immediately under the newly secreted pus It was made up of eminences and hollows the former consisting of clusters of tortuous bloodvessels the latter filled with pus After a few minutes exposure the following changes were ob served a transparent pellicle covered the surface under which glo bules of air made their appearance in different places then horizontal anastomozing canals filled with red blood were seen to form and red spots which were the termination of perpendicular canals were observed under the pellicle Drawings illustrating these appearances accompanv the paper After detailing further proofs and illustrations of the above phe nomena presented by the surfaces of sores covered with pus Sir Everard observes that the carbonic acid originally contained in the tubes is very readily displaced by the blood in consequence of its disposition to absorb that particular gas which forms so large a pro portion of its component parts He thinks that the extrication of carbonic acid is the original cause of the tubularity of pus and that the tubes are then filled with red blood and thus connected with the circulation The succeeding changes are illustrated by Mr Bauers drawing which the author laid before the Society last year Qn the Laws which regulate the Absorption of Polarized Light by Doubly Refracting Crystals By David Brewster LLD FRS Lond and Edinb In a Letter addressed to the Right Hon Sir Jo seph Banks Bart GCB PRS Read November 12 1818 LPhil Trans 1819 p 11 In examining the polarizing structure of acetate of copper the authors attention was drawn to certain changes of colour exhibited by its crystal when exposed in different positions to polarized light and as these were independent of the thickness of the plate and of any analysis of the transmitted pencil he was induced to regard them as a new affection of light ascribable to the absorption of the homogeneous tints forming the compound colour of the crystal Dr Brewster therefore collected a variety of coloured crystals with a view to examine the phenomena which they presented when cut at different angles with the axis and when exposed in different po sitions to polarized light The details of this examination are next given and as the property of transparent bodies by which they detain and assimilate to their own substance a portion of the rays which penetrate them while the rest are freely transmitted is re lated to the axes of double refraction the author first describes the phenomena presented by crystals of one axis and then explains the modifications which they undergo when the number of axes is in creased It appears from these investigations that the colouring particles of crystals instead of being indiscriminately dispersed throughout their mass have an arrangement related to the ordinary anrd extraordinary forces which they exert upon light In some cases the extraordinary

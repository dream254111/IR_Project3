J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107764,ON A METHOD OF COMPARING THE LIGHT OF THE SUN WITH THAT OF THE FIXED STARS,I206984, 19  IVON A METHOD OF COMPARING THE LIGHT OF THE SUN WITH THAT OF THE IXED STARS BY WILLIAM HYDE WOLLASTON MD FRS READ DECEMBER 11 1828 ONE OF THE MOST INGENIOUS CONTRIBUTORS TO THE TRANSACTIONS OF OUR SOCIETY IN THE LAST CENTURY THE REV JOHN MICHELL IN A PAPER INTITULED  AN INQUIRY INTO THE PROBABLE PARALLAX AND MAGNITUDE OF FIXED STARS C HAS PROPOSED IT TO ASTRONOMERS AS AN OBJECT WORTHY THEIR ATTENTION TO DETERMINE WHAT PROPOR TION THE LIGHT AFFORDED US SEPARATELY BY EACH FIXED STAR BEARS TO THE LIGHT WHICH WE RECEIVE FROM THE SUN SINCE FROM OUR INABILITY TO MEASURE THE ANNUAL PARALLAX OF THOSE VERY REMOTE BODIES SUCH A COMPARISON IS THE BEST PERHAPS THE ONLY METHOD WITHIN OUR REACH OF OBTAINING THOUGH NOT CERTAIN YET PRO BABLE ESTIMATES OF THEIR DISTANCES AND THUS FORMING REASONABLE CONJECTURES CONCERNING THE EXTENT OF THE VISIBLE UNIVERSE IN ORDER THAT WE MAY JUDGE WITH THE LEAST CHANCE OF ERROR OF THE MEAN DISTANCE OF THOSE STARS WHICH ARE THE NEAREST TO THE EARTH HE DIRECTS US TO COMPARE THE LIGHT OF THE BRIGLHTEST STARS WITH THAT OF THE SUN AND NEXT TO CALCULATE HOW FAR THE SUN MUST BE RE MOVED TO MAKE THE LIGHT THAT WE SHOULD THEN RECEIVE FROM HIM NOT IMORE THAN EQUAL TO THE MEAN LIGHT OF THE STARS CHOSEN FOR COMPARISON MR MICHELL MADE AS HE SAYS SOME RUDE EXPERIMENTS FOR DETERMINING THE COMPARATIVE BRILLIANCY OF CERTAIN PRINCIPAL STARS BUT HAS NOT SUGGESTED ANY CON TRIVANCE FOR COMPARING A STAR WITH THE SUN HE STATES HOWEVER SO DISTINCTLY THE GREAT OBJECT OF SUCH A COMPARISON AND THE INFERENCES WHICH AN INDUSTRIOUS OB SERVER WOULD THENCE BE ENTITLED TO DRAW CONCERNING THE DISTANCES OF THOSE STARS WHOSE LIGHT HE MIGHT SUCCEED IN MEASURING THAT IT IS SURPRISING THAT NO ASTRONO MER HAS BEEN INCITED BY THESE REMARKS TO DEVISE A METHOD OF MAKING THE REQUISITE OBSERVATIONS AND THAT NOW SO MANY YEARS AFTER MR MICHELLS SUGGESTION WAS MADE PUBLIC SO MUCH REMAINS TO BE EFFECTED IN THIS BRANCH OF PHOTOMETRY  PHIL TRANS 1767 P 234 D 220 DR WOLLASTONS METHOD OF COMPARING THE LIGHT FROM A COMPARISON WHICH I MADE IN THE YEAR 1799 BY A METHOD DESCRIBED IN THE NOTE SUBJOINED OF THE LIGHT OF THE SUN WITH THAT OF THE MOON I SHOULD ESTIMATE THE DIRECT LIGHT OF THE SUN AS BEING NEARLY ONE MILLION TIMES GREATER THAN THAT OF THE MOON AND CONSEQUENTLY THE DIRECT LIGHT OF THE SUN AS VERY MANY MILLIONS TIMES GREATER THAN THAT AFFORDED US BY ALL THE FIXED STARS TAKEN COLLECTIVELY SUCH THEN BEING TO OUR VISUAL ORGANS THE VAST DISPROPORTION IN RADIANCE BETWEEN THE SUN AND THE WHOLE STARRY FIRMAMENT IT IS NOT TO BE EX PECTED THAT WE SHOULD ASSIGN VERY ACCURATELY HOW MUCH GREATER THE LIGHT OF  THE OBSERVATIONS ON WHICH THIS ESTIMATE IS FOUNDED ARE GIVEN IN DETAIL AT THE END OF THE AP PENDIX TO THIS PAPER THE MODE OF MAKING THE OBSERVATIONS WAS THE FOLLOWING THE SUNS LIGHT WAS COMPARED WITH THAT OF A CANDLE BY ADMITTING A BEAM OF IT INTO A ROOM THROUGH A SMALL CIRCULAR HOLE IN A PLATE OF METAL FASTENED IN A WINDOWSHUTTER AND A SMALL CYLINDER OF ANY OPAQUE MATERIAL BEING PLACED IN THE BEAM SO AS TO CAST A SHADOW UPON A SCREEN THE DISTANCE OF A CANDLE FROM THE SAME CYLINDER OR AN EQUAL ONE PLACED AT THE SAME DISTANCE FROM THE SCREEN WAS VARIED UNTIL THE SHADOW IN THE LINE OF THE CANDLE BECAME EQUALLY INTENSE WITH THE SHADOW IN THE LINE OF THE SUN THE DIRECT LIGHT OF THE MOON WAS COMPARED WITH THE LIGHT OF A CANDLE IN THE SAME MANNER THIS METHOD OF COMPARING LIGHTS BY THE INTENSITY OF THE SHADOWS WHICH THEY OCCASION WAS PURSUED ALSO BY COUNT RUMFORD IT APPEARS FROM THE MEAN OF THE OBSERVATIONS GIVEN IN NO V OF THE APPENDIX THAT THE LIGHT OF THE SUN IS EQUAL TO THAT OF 5563 CANDLES PLACED AT THE DISTANCE OF ONE FOOT A RESULT WHICH ACCORDS VERY NEARLY WITH THAT OF BOVGUCER FOR HE STATES THE LIGHT OF THE SUN TO BE EQUAL TO THAT OF 11664 WAX CANDLES AT THE DISTANCE OF 16 INCHES FRENCH WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO 5774 WAX CANDLES AT THE DISTANCE OF ONE FOOT ENGLISH IT APPEARS ALSO FROM MY EXPERIMENTS THAT THE LIGHT OF THE FULL MOON IS EQUAL TO TH PART OF THE LIGHT OF A CANDLE PLACED AT THE DISTANCE OF A FOOT AND HENCE THAT THE SUNS LIGHT IS EQUAL TO 5563 X 144 X MOONS LIGHT  801072 X MOONS LIGHT BOUGUTR WHO DIFFERS GREATLY FROM ME IN THE COMPARISON OF THE MOON WITH A CANDLE STATES THE LIGHT OF THE SUN TO BE  300000 X MOONS LIGHT THE PROPORTION WHICH THE LIGHT OF THE FULL MOON OUGHT TO BEAR TO THE LIGHT OF THE SUN ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT THE MOON GIVES OFF AGAIN ALL THE SOLAR LIGHT THAT FALLS UPON IT HAS BEEN DIFFERENTLY ESTIMATED BY SEVERAL MATHEMATICIANS WHO HAVE COMPUTED IT THE LIGHT OF THE SUN AT THE EARTH BEING REPRESENTED BY UNITY MR MICIELL EXPRESSES THAT OF THE FULL MOON BY SIN2 A DIA METER   EULER IN THE TRANSACTIONS OF THE BERLIN ACADEMY FOR 1750 REPRESENTS THE LIGHT OF THE FULL MOON BY F SIN2 I X DIAMETER WHICH IS ONLY XTH OF THE FORMER EXPRESSION OF MR MICHELL NEITHER OF THESE EXPRESSIONS HOWEVER APPEARS TO BE CORRECT FOR IF WE CONSIDER THAT THE QUANTITY OF SOLAR LIGHT VWHICH FALLS UPON ANY POINT IN THE MOONS SURFACE MUST VARY IF WE REGARD THE SUNS RAYS AS PARALLEL AS THE COSINE OF THE ANGULAR DISTANCE OF THAT POINT FROM THE POINT IN THE MOON OVER WHICH THE SUN IS VERTICAL WE SHALL OBTAIN BY FOLLOWING EULTEIS OWN METHOD THE FORMULA 1  2 SINS  SEMIDIAMETER COS3 C SEMIDIANMETER 1   3 AEE  N DAE  A TO E XPRESS THE QUANTITY OF LIGHT WHICH ON THE GIVEN SUP POSITION WE OUGHT TO RECEIVE FROM THE MOON AND THIS EXPRESSION REDUCED TO NUMBERS  1 THE MOON THEREFORE APPEARS TO GIVE OFF ONLY ABOUT TH OF THE LIGHT WHICH SHE RECEIVESOF THE SUN WITH THAT OF THE FIXED STARS 21 THE SUN IS THAN THAT EXCEEDINGLY MINUTE QUANTITY OF IT WHICH SHINES UPON US FROM ANY ONE EVEN THE MOST BRILLIANT OF THE FIXED STARS IT MAY BE REMEMBERED THAT ON A FORMER OCCASION IN EXAMINING THE CORRECT PERFORMANCE OF A GOOD TELESCOPE I FOUND THAT THE SUNS IMAGE REFLECTED FROM THE SURFACE OF A SMALL SPHERE SUCH AS THAT OF A THERMOMETERBULB FILLED WITH MER CURY AND VIEWED AT A PROPER DISTANCE THROUGH A TELESCOPE IS TO APPEARANCE EXTREMELY LIKE A FIXED STAR AND FORMS IN SUCH EXPERIMENTS AN ADMIRABLE SUB STITUTE FOR ONE IN BEING REALLY FIXED AND THEREFORE WELL ADAPTED FOR DELIBERATE OBSERVATION IT OCCURRED TO ME WHILE ENGAGED IN THIS EXAMINATION THAT BY COMPARING SUCH A REFLECTED IMAGE WITH ONE OF THE LARGER STARS I MIGHT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN SOME GROUNDS FOR ESTIMATING THE LIGHT OF THE STAR IT WOULD BE DESIREABLE THOUGH EXTREMELY DIFFICULT IN CONDUCTING SUCH AN EXPERIMENT TO MAKE A DIRECT COMPARISON BETWEENLL THE STAR AND THE SUNS IMAGE SINCE IN THAT CASE WE SHOULD BE ENABLED TO AVOID THE UNCERTAINTIES INSE PARABLE FROM AN INDIRECT COMPARISON THE CONSEQUENCE OF OBSERVING AT TIMES SO DISTANT THAT THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE INTERVAL HAS UNDERGONE CONSIDERABLE CHANGE AS HOWEVER THE ONLY PRACTICABLE METHOD OF OBSERVING IS THE INDIRECT ONE BY COMPARING THE TWO OBJECTS WITH SOME COMMON STANDARD AT DIFFERENT TIMES WE MUST ENDEAVOUR TO REMOVE THOSE UNCERTAINTIES FROM OUR RESULTS BY REPEATING EACH SERIES OF COMPARISONS SO FREQUENTLY THAT THE AVERAGE OF EACH SERIES MAY BE AFFECTED BY ATMOSPHERIC VICISSITUDES OR MNAY FAIRLY BE PRESUMED TO BE SO IN AN EQUAL DEGREE THE COMMON STANDARD OF COMPARISON WHICH I CHOSE WAS THE IMAGE OF A CANDLE REFLECTED FROM A SMALL THERMOMETERBULB IN MOST TRIALS ABOUT LTH OF AN INCH IN DIAMETER FILLED WITH MERCURY AND SEEN BY ONE EYE THROUGH A LENS OF ABOUT TWO INCHES FOCUS AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE SUNS IMAGE REFLECTED IN THE MANNER ABOVE DESCRIBED FROM A THERMOMETERBULB PLACED AT A DISTANCE OR THE STAR ITSELF WAS VIEWED BY THE OTHER EYE THROUGH A TELESCOPE IN ORDER TO MAKE THE LIGHT OF THE TWO OBJECTS WHEN SEEN THROUGH THE TELE SCOPE AND THAT OF THE CANDLE MORE NEARLY ALIKE IN COLOUR I PLACED TWO YELLOW GLASSES AT THE EYEPIECE AND I THOUGHT IT EXPEDIENT TO HAVE IN VIEW AT THE SAME TIME WITH THE SUBJECT OF COMPARISON TWO CANDLES ONE OF TALLOW THE OTHER OF WAX THAT BY MAKING THE STAR OR THE LITTLE SUN A MEAN BETWEEN TLHE22 DR WOLLASTONS METHOD OF COMPARING THE LIGHT TWO LIGHTS I MIGHT OBTAIN A NEARER APPROXIMATION TO THE TRUTH THE MEASURE TAKEN IN EACH EXPERIMENT WAS THE DISTANCE OF THE TWO CANDLES FROM THE BULB AND EVERY DISTANCE THAT I HAVE REPORTED AMONGST THE OBSERVATIONS WAS THE MEAN RESULT OF SEVERAL TRIALS IN REDUCING THESE OBSERVATIONS WE HAVE TO CONSIDER THAT THOUGH THE IMAGE OF THE SUN WHICH IS HALF THE RADIUS DISTANT FROM THE CENTRE OF THE BULB SUB TENDS AT ITS SURFACE THE SAME ANGLE OF HALF A DEGREE AS THE SUN ITSELF AND THERE FORE TO AN EYE PLACED AT THE SURFACE WOULD APPEAR EQUALLY BRILLIANT WITH THE SUN ITSELF YET THE APPARENT DIAMETER OF THIS LITTLE SUN WILL DECREASE IN PRO PORTION AS THE EYE RECEDES FROM THE BULB SO THAT AT THE DISTANCE OF D INCHES THE APPARENT DIAMETER OF THE IMAGE WILL BE REDUCED IN THE RATIO OF 4TH OF THE DIAMETER OF THE BULB OR OF  TO D AND CONSEQUENTLY THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE 4D 4 D IMAGE WILL BE REDUCED IN THE RATIO OF 1 TO THE SQUARE OF B  IF THE DISTANCE OF THE EYE FROM THE BULB BE SO CHOSEN THAT ON COMPARING THE LITTLE SUN AND THE STAR SEPARATELY WITH THE CANDLES IMAGE THE CANDLE IN THE TWO CASES IS AT UNEQUAL DISTANCES FROM ITS BULB D BEING MADE TO REPRESENT THE CAN DLES DISTANCE FROM THE BULB IN COMPARING IT WITH THE SUN AND 3 THE CANDLES 4 D A DISTANCE FROM THE BULB IN COMPARING IT WITH THE STAR G X  WILL BE THE DI STANCE AT WHICH THE LITTLE SUN WOULD APPEAR OF EQUAL BRIGHTNESS WITH THE STAR AND THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE LITTLE SUN WOULD THEN BE TO THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE SUN ITSELF AS 1 TO L4 XDL IF IN TWO COMPARISONS MADE THE ONE BETWEEN THE CANDLE AND THE SUN THE OTHER BETWEEN THE CANDLE AND A STAR THE CANDLE BE REFLECTED BY BULBS OF DIF FERENT DIAMETERS AND VIEWED WITH LENSES OF UNEQUAL FOCAL LENGTH THE APPARENT DIAMETER OF THE CANDLES IMAGE WILL BE AS THE DIAMETER OF THE BULB DIRECTLY AND AS THE FOCAL LENGTH OF THE LENS INVERSELY AND HENCE IF B BE THE DIAMETER OF THE BULB AND I THE FOCAL LENGTH OF THE LENS IN COMPARING THE CANDLE WITH THE SUN AND 3 BE THE DIAMETER OF THE BULB AND X THE FOCAL LENGTH OF THE LENS IN COM  IF ANY OTHER ARTIFICIAL LIGHT COULD BE FOUND WHICH WOULD AT ALL TIMES BE OF UNIFORM BRILLIANCY AND OF SO WHITE A COLOUR AS TO SUPERSEDE THE NECESSITY OF USING YELLOW GLASSES IT WOULD OF COURSE BE PRE FERABLE AS A STANDARD TO THE LIGHT OF A CANDLEOF THE SUN WITH THAT OF THE FIXED STARS PARING THE CANDLE WITH THE STAR B X  X  X WILL BE THE DISTANCE AT WHICH THE LITTLE SUN WOULD APPEAR OF EQUAL BRIGHTNESS WITH THE STAR AND THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE LITTLE SUN WOULD THEN BE TO THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE SUN ITSELF AS 1 TO B X A X L X  AND IT IS ACCORDING TO THE LATTER FORMULA THAT THE OBSER VATIONS MADE WITH BULBS OF DIFFERENT DIAMETER AND WITH LENSES OF DIFFERENT FOCAL LENGTH HAVE BEEN REDUCED SO AS TO BE COMPARED IN NO IV OF THE APPENDIX THE FIRST STAR THAT I COMPARED WITH THE SUN WAS SIRIUS AND THE OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE AT TIMES WHEN THE ALTITUDES OF THE TWO BODIES BEING NOT VERY WIDELY DIFFERENT THEIR POWERS OF ILLUMINATION MIGHT BE PRESUMED TO BE AFFECTED ON THE AVERAGE IN ALMOST AN EQUAL DEGREE BY THE ATMOSPHERE THE TABLE OF REDUCED OBSERVATIONS NO IV OF THE APPENDIX IN WHICH EACH OF SEVEN OBSERVATIONS OF THE SUN IS COMPARED WITH EACH OF SEVEN OBSERVATIONS OF SIRIUS WILL BE FOUND TO EXHIBIT DISCORDANCES WHICH ARE REFERRIBLE PROBABLY TO OUR VARIABLE CLIMATE AND TO THE SMOKY ATMOSPHERE OF LONDON UNIFORMLY TRANSPARENT SKIES ARE REQUISITE TO GIVE UNIFORMITY TO SUCH EXPERIMENTS AND IN OUR CLIMATE THEREFORE THOUGH THE MEAN OF VERY MANY COMPARISONS WOULD PROBABLY GIVE A RESULT NOT VERY REMOTE FROM THE MEAN OF A MUCH SMALLER NUMBER OF TRIALS MADE UNDER A LESS VARIABLE ATMOSPHERE WE MUST EXPECT THE GREATEST AND LEAST RESULTS TO DIFFER WIDELY FROM ONE ANOTHER THE MEAN OF THE VARIOUS TRIALS SEEMS TO SHOW THAT THE LIGHT OF SIRIUS IS EQUAL TO THAT OF THE SUN REFLECTED FROM THE SURFACE OF A SPHERE OTH OF AN INCH IN DIAMETER AND SEEN AT THE DISTANCE OF ABOUT 210 FEET THE DIAMETER OF SUCH AN IMAGE OF THE SUN IS TO THAT OF THE SUN ITSELF AS 1 TO 100000 AND CONSE QUENTLY THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE IMAGE WOULD BE TO THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE SUN ITSELF AS 1 TO 10000000000  BUT AS NEARLY HALF OF THE LIGHT MUST BE LOST DURING REFLECTION WE ARE NOT WARRANTED BY THESE EXPERIMENTS IN SUPPOSING THAT THE LIGHT OF SIRIUS EXCEEDS A 20000000000TH PART OF THE SUNS LIGHT  AN OBSERVER INTENDING TO PURSUE THIS INQUIRY WOULD DO WELL THEREFORE TO CHOOSE A FAVOURABLE CLIMATE AND FURTHER HE OUGHT TO SELECT SUCH STARS FOR COMPARING WITH THE SUN AS HAVE SEVERALLY AT THE TIMES OF OBSERVATION NEARLY THE SAME ALTITUDE WITH THE SUN THE ACCURACY OF THESE COMPARISONS WITH THE SUN WOULD ADMIT OF RIGOROUS INVESTIGATION BY COMPARING THE SAME STARS WITH ONE ANOTHER STARS HAVING THE SAME 2R MIGHT BE COMPARED AT PLACES HAVING DIFFERENT LATITUDES OR EVEN IN DIFFERENT HEMISPHERES WHEREBY THE UNEQUAL INFLUENCE OF THE ATMOSPHERE AT DIFFERENT ALTITUDES MIGHT BE WHOLLY ELIMINATED 2324 DR WOLLASTONS METHOD OF COMPARING THE LIGHT WERE THE SUN REMOVED TO SUCH A DISTANCE THAT THE LIGHT WHICH WE RECEIVED FROM IT WERE ONLY A TWENTY THOUSAND MILLIONTH PART OF ITS PRESENT LIGHT THAT DISTANCE WOULD BE EQUAL TO 2 X 100000 X ITS PRESENT DISTANCE AND IT WOULD IF STILL SITUATED IN THE ECLIPTIC HAVE A PARALLAX IN LONGITUDE OF NEARLY 3 BUT IF PLACED AT THE SAME ANGULAR DISTANCE FROM THE ECLIPTIC AS SIRIUS SINCE THE PARALLAX VARIES AS THE SINE OF A STARS LATITUDE AND THE LATITUDE OF SIRIUS IS ABOUT 39 IT WOULD HAVE A PARALLAX IN LATITUDE OF ABOUT 16 ASSUMING THE PARALLAX OF SIRIUS TO BE HALF A SECOND AND CONSEQUENTLY ITS DI STANCE FROM THE EARTH TO BE 525481 TIMES THE DISTANCE OF THE SUN FROM THE EARTH SIRIUS IF PLACED AT THE SUNS DISTANCE WOULD SUBTEND 37 TIMES THE SUNS APPARENT DIAMETER AND WOULD AFFORD US AS MUCH LIGHT AS 138 SUNS FROM SIMILAR EXPERIMENTS TO THOSE I MADE ON SIRIUS IT APPEARED THAT THE LIGHT AFFORDED US BY LYRA WAS ABOUT 10 OOOOOOOTH PART OF THE SUNS LIGHT OR ABOUT GTH PART OF THE LIGHT OF SIRIUS WITHOUT EXTENDING THIS METHOD TO A COMPARISON OF THE STARS WITH THE SUN WE MAY CONFINE IT IF WE THINK PROPER TO COMPARING THE STARS WITH ONE ANOTHER SO THAT IN FULFILMENT OF THE WISHES OF MR MICHELL INSTEAD OF DISTRIBUTING THEM AS HAS HITHERTO BEEN DONE INTO A FEW ILLDEFINED CLASSES THEY MAY BE RANKED WITH PRECISION BOTH ACCORDING TO THEIR RESPECTIVE BRIGHTNESS AND THE EXACT DEGREE OF IT IN CONCLUDING THE PAPER WHICH IS NOW SUBMITTED TO THE SOCIETY I REQUEST THEM TO DIRECT THEIR ATTENTION RATHER TO THE RNETHOD THAN TO THE OBSERVATIONS FOR THESE HAVE BEEN MUCH TOO FEW IN NUMBER TO ENABLE ME TO STATE WITH ANY DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE WHAT PROPORTION THE LIGHT OF THE SUN REALLY DOES BEAR TO EITHER OF THE STARS COMPARED WITH IT IT WAS MY INTENTION HAD MY HEALTH PER MITTED IT TO HAVE PROCEEDED WITH THIS INQUIRY UNTIL BY MULTIPLIED OBSERVATIONS I HAD ASCERTAINED HOW NEARLY THE MEAN OF ONE EXTENSIVE SERIES OF COMPARISONS ACCORDED WITH THE MEAN OF ANOTHER SERIES AND HOW FAR THEREFORE THE METHOD ITSELF WAS DESERVING OF CONFIDENCE BUT SINCE I HAVE NOW NO PROSPECT OF BRING ING THE SUBJECT TO PERFECTION I SUBMIT THE METHOD ITSELF TO THE CONSIDERATION OF INDUSTRIOUS OBSERVERS WHO WILL SOON BE ABLE TO JUDGE OF THE EXPEDIENCY OF CON TINUING THE INQUIRY  PHIL TRANS 1767 P 241OF THE SUN WITH THAT OF THE FIXED STARS APPENDIX I OBSERVATIONS OF A REFLECTED IMAGE OF THE SUN COMPARED WITH A SIMILAR IMAGE OF A CANDLE

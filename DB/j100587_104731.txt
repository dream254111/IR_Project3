EARTHQUAKES W H E N SO GREAT AND UNUSUAL A PHAENOMENON AS AN EARTHQUAKE AND THAT REPEATED HAPPENS AMONG US IT WILL NATU RALLY EXCITE A SERIOUS REFLECTION IN EVERY ONE THAT IS CAPABLE OF THINKING AND WE CANNOT HELP CONSIDER ING IT IN A PHILOSOPHICAL AS WELL AS RELIGIOUS VIEW ANY MIND WILL TAKE THE ALARM WHEN WE PERCEIVE A MOTION THAT AFFECTS THE EARTH THAT BEARS THE WHOLE CITY OF LONDON AND SOME MILES ROUND AND AT THE SAME TIME WHILST IT GIVES US SO SENSIBLE A SHAKE SO GENTLY SETS US DOWN AGAIN WITHOUT DA MAGE TO ANY BUILDINGS AND WITHOUT A LIFE LOST IN THE WORKS OF NATURE AND PROVIDENCE THERE ARE NO DEGREES OF GREAT AND LITTLE COMPARISONS ARE INCOMPATIBLE NEVERTHELESS WE OURSELVES ARE N N N N MORE  THIS PAPER IS PUBLISHED SEPARATELY BY THE AUTHOR IN A PAM PHLET AT LONDON 1750 IN 8VO READ MARCH 22 1749642 MORE AFFECTED WITH WHAT SEEMS GREAT IN OUR OWN APPREHENSIONS BUT AN O M N I P O T E N T P O W E R ADMITS OF NO DISTINCTIONS AND WHILST PRODIGI OUS EFFECTS ARE PRODUCD FROM CAUSES IMPERCEP TIBLE IT RIGHTLY CLAIMS OUR SERIOUS ATTENTION AS WELL AS WONDER NOR NEED WE LOSE SIGHT OF THE THEOLOGICAL PURPOSE OF THESE AMAZING ALARMS WHILST WE ENDEAVOUR TO FIND OUT THE PHILOSOPHY OF THEM PERMIT ME THEN TO THROW IN MY THOUGHTS ON THE CAUSE OF EARTHQUAKES I DID NOT ENTER INTO THE COMMON NOTION OF STRUGGLES BETWEEN SUBTERRANEOUS WINDS OR FIRES VAPOURS OR WATERS THAT HEAVD UP THE GROUND LIKE ANIMAL CONVULSIONS BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS AN ELECTRICAL SHOCK EXACTLY OF THE SAME NATURE AS THOSE NOW BECOME VERY FA MILIAR IN ELECTRICAL EXPERIMENTS WHEN WE REFLECT ON THE UNUSUAL WINTER NOW PAST BEYOND WHAT OCCURS TO ANY ONES MEMORY THAT IT HAS BEEN DRY AND WARM TO AN EXTRAORDINARY DEGREE THE WIND GENERALLY SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST AND THAT WITHOUT RAIN WE MAY WITH MUCH REA SON IMAGINE THAT THE EARTH HAS BEEN IN A STATE OF ELECTRICITY READY FOR THAT PARTICULAR VIBRATION WHEREIN ELECTRICITY CONSISTS AND THAT IT HAS BEEN SO WE MAY FURTHER CON CLUDE FROM THE EXTRAORDINARY FORWARDNESS OF VEGE TATION FROM THE FREQUENCY OF THE NORTHERN LIGHTS AND ESPECIALLY OF THAT CALLED AURORA AUSTRALIS WHICH ARE WITH US IN REQUENT AND TWICE REPEATED JUST BE FORE THE EARTHQUAKES BEING OF SUCH COLOURS AS WE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE AND REMOVED SOUTHWARD QUITE CONTRARY TO THOSE COMMON WITH US ADD643 ADD TO THIS THAT SOME FOREIGNERS AMONG US FROM ITALY AND THOSE PARTS WHERE EARTHQUAKES ARE FREQUENT OBSERVING THESE LIGHTS AND THE PARTICULAR TEMPER OF THE AIR DID ACTUALLY FORESCE THE EVENT OF AN EARTHQUAKE ALL THESE MATTERS CONCUR IN SHEWING THAT THE EARTH WAS IN A STATE OF ELECTRICITY BEYOND WHAT HAS EVER BEEN IN OUR MEMORY ADMITTING THIS THERE IS NOTHING WANTING TO PRO DUCE THE WONDERFUL EFFECT OF AN EARTHQUAKE BUT THE TOUCH OF ANY NONELECTRIC BODY AND THAT MUST NECESSARILY BE HAD AB EXTRA FROM THE REGION OF THE AIR OR ATMOSPHERE WE HAD LATELY A VERY PRETTY DISCOURSE READ HERE FROM MR FRANKLYN OF PHILADELPHIA  CONCERNING THUNDERGUSTS LIGHTS AND LIKE METEORS HE WELL SOLVES THEM BY THE TOUCH OF CLOUDS RAISD FROM THE SEA WHICH ARE NONELECTRICS AND OF CLOUDS RAISD FROM EXHALATIONS OF THE LAND WHICH ARE ELEC TRIFYD THAT LITTLE SNAP WHICH WE HEAR IN OUR ELECTRICAL EXPERIMENTS WHEN PRODUCD BY A THOUSAND MILES COMPASS OF CLOUDS AND THAT REECHOED FROM CLOUD TO CLOUD THE EXTENT OF THE FIRMAMENT MAKES THAT THUNDER WHICH AFFRIGHTENS US FROM THE SAME PRINCIPLE I INFER THAT IF A NON ELECTRIC CLOUD DISCHARGES ITS CONTENTS UPON ANY PART OF THE EARTH WHEN IN A HIGHELECTRIFYD STATE AN EARTHQUAKE MUST NECESSARILY ENSUE AS A SHOCK OF THE ELECTRIC TUBE IN THE HUMAN BODY SO THE SHOCK OF MANY MILES COMPASS OF SOLID EARTH MUST NEEDS BE AN EARTHQUAKE AND THAT SNAP FROM THE CONTACT BE THE HORRIBLE UNCOUTH NOISE THEREOF N N N N 2 I HAVE  READ NOV 16 1749 PUBLISHD WITH OTHER TRACTS ON ELECTRI CITY BY MR PETER COLLINSON F R S LONDON 1750 8VO644 I HAVE BEEN INFORMED BY THOSE WHO WERE UP AND ABROAD THE PRECEDING NIGHT AND EARLY IN THE MORNING THAT CORUSCATIONS IN THE AIR WERE EX TREMELY FREQUENT WHICH CONFIRMS US IN THE NOTION OF THE EARTHS BEING THEN IN AN ELECTRIFYD STATE AND THAT A LITTLE BEFORE THE EARTHQUAKE A LARGE AND BLACK CLOUD SUDDENLY COVERD THE HEMISPHERE WHICH PROBABLY OCCASIOND THE SHOCK BY DISCHARGE OF A SHOWER IT MAY BE SAID THAT IF THIS WERE THE CASE EARTHQUAKES WOULD HAPPEN MUCH OFTENER THAN WE FIND THEM IT MAY BE ANSWERD THAT THEY PRO BABLY DO MUCH OFTENER THAN OBSERVD BUT SLIGHT ONES BECAUSE OF THE EARTHS BEING SLIGHTLY ELECTRI FIED AND SUCH A WINTER AS THIS HAS NOT BEEN KNOWN BEFORE TO WHICH WE ATTRIBUTE THE PRESENT EARTHQUAKE THE REASON IS OBVIOUS WHY EARTHQUAKES ARE NOT SO FREQUENT WITH US AND THE NORTHERN REGIONS IN GENERAL AS IN ITALY AND MORE SOUTHERN CLIMES AND A DUE CONSIDERATION OF IT CONFIRMS OUR REASONING ALL ELECTRICITY REQUIRES GREAT DRYNESS AND WARMTH AND I DOUBT NOT BUT EARTHQUAKES OF A SMALL DEGREE HAVE AND DO FREQUENTLY HAPPEN AND MANY PEO PLE NOW RECOLLECT THAT THEY HAVE BEEN SHAKEN IN THEIR BEDS THO THEY TOOK NO NOTICE OF IT THEN HAVING HAD NO EXPERIENCE OF AN EARTHQUAKE ALL THAT WE HAVE SAID UPON THE SUBJECT RECEIVES GREAT STRENGTH FROM THIS PARTICULAR THAT WATER STRENGTHENS AND CONVEYS THE FORCE OF ELECTRICITY FROM WHENCE WE MAY ACCOUNT FOR THAT OBSERVA TION THAT THE MOST DREADFUL EFFECTS OF EARTHQUAKES ARE ALWAYS FELT IN MARITIME TOWNS AS PORTROYAL IN645 IN JAMAICA LIMA IN PERU MESSINA IN SICILY C AND HERE WE FIND PLAINLY THAT THE SHOCK WENT ALONG THE RIVER BOTH UPWARDS AND DOWNWARDS FAR THER THAN BY LAND LIKE THE BOTTLE OF WATER HELD IN THE HAND IN ELECTRICAL EXPERIMENTS WE ARGUE THE SAME FROM THE SICKNESSES PAINS IN THE JOINTS AND BACK RHEUMATIC HYSTERIC NERVOUS CASES HEADACH COLICS AND THE LIKE WHICH MANY PEOPLE ESPECIALLY OF THE WEAKER CONSTITUTIONS FELT FOR MORE THAN ONE DAY AFTER JUST AS AFTER ELECTRIFICATION BUT FROM HENCE IT IS HIGHLY WORTHY OF REMARK THAT THE FINGER OF P R O V I D E N C E IS NOTORIOUSLY DISCERNIBLE HEREIN  OF H I M WHO GUIDES THE THUNDER AND DIRECTS THE STORM THO IT OPERATES BY NATURAL CAUSES YET IT IS THAT WHICH GIVES THEM THEIR DESTINATION FOR THO THE COASTS OF THE SEA ARE MOST LIABLE TO AND SUSCEPTIBLE OF THIS MIGHTY SHOCK WHICH WE CALL AN EARTH QUAKE YET THE CHASTENING ROD IS DIRECTED TO TOWNS AND CITIES WHERE ARE INHABITANTS THE OB JECTS OF ITS MONITION NOT TO BARE CLIFFS AND AN UNINHABITED BEACH AND THERE CANNOT BE A MORE DIRECT PROOF THAT EARTHQUAKES ARE DIVINE JUDGMENTS THAN THIS OBSERVATION FOR IN ALL ANTIENT HISTORY EARTHQUAKES ARE EVER FOUND IN GREAT CITIES A D 17 NO LESS THAN 12 FLOURISHING CITIES IN ASIA MINOR WERE DESTROYD IN ONE NIGHT IN A D 1456 AT NAPLES 40000 PEOPLE PERISHED BY AN EARTHQUAKE IN 1531 IN THE CITY OF LISBON 1400 HOUSES WERE THROWN DOWN WE646 WE SEE AND ADMIRE THE EFFECTS OF ELECTRICITY AND ITS STUPENDOUS PROPERTIES EVERY DAY WHICH SEEMS AS IT WERE AN ANIMATING SOUL TO MATTER THE ANTIENTS HAD A NOTION THAT THE EARTH WAS A GREAT ANIMAL PROBABLY FROM SOME OBSERVATIONS OF ELECTRICITY BUT CERTAINLY WHEN IN OUR DAYS WE FEEL THESE UNUSUAL AND EXTRAORDINARY CONVULSIONS OF NA TURE IT IS A LESSON TO US TO DO OUR DUTY TOWARD THAT GREAT BEING WHO BY A DROP OF WATER CAN PRODUCE EFFECTS SO PRODIGIOUS MARCH 13 WILLIAM STUKELY 174950 XXV

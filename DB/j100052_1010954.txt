PRESIDENT OF THE GENERAL FEDERATION OF WOMENS CLUBS THE HISTORY OF THE WOMANS CLUB MOVEMENT BY MRS J C CROLY JENNIE JUNE CONTAINS THIS PASSAGE IN ONE OF THE OPENING CHAPTERS THE WOMAN HAS BEEN THE ONE ISOLATED FACT IN THE UNIVERSE THE OUTLOOK UPON THE WORLD THE MEANS OF EDUCATION THE OPPOR TUNITIES FOR ADVANCEMENT HAD ALL BEEN DENIED HER  THE OPPORTUNITY CAME WITH THE AWAKENING OF THE COMMUNAL SPIRIT THE RECOGNITION OF THE LAW OF SOLIDARITY OF INTERESTS THE SOCIOLOGIC AD VANCE WHICH ESTABLISHED A BASIS OF EQUALITY AMONG A WIDE DIVERSITY OF CONDITIONS AND INDIVIDUALITIES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL CAPABLE OF USING THEM THIS GREAT ADVANCE WAS NOT CONFINED TO A SOCIETY OR A NEIGHBORHOOD IT DID NOT REQUIRE SUBSCRIPTION TO A TENET OR THE GIVING UP OF ONES MODE OF LIFE IT WAS SIMPLY THE CHANGE OF A POINT OF VIEW THE OPENING OF A DOOR THE STEPPING OUT INTO THE FREEDOM OF THE OUTER AIR AND THE SWEET SENSE OF FELLOWSHIP THAT COMES WITH LIBERTY AND LIGHT THE DIFFERENCE WAS ONLY A POINT OF VIEW BUT IT CHANGED THE ASPECT OF THE WORLD THIS NEW NOTE WHICH MEANT FOR THE WOMAN LIBERTY BREADTH AND UNITY WAS STRUCK BY THE WOMANS CLUB TO THE TERM  CLUB  AS APPLIED TO AND BY WOMEN MAY BE FITLY REFERRED THE WORDS IN WHICH JOHN ADDINGTON SYMONDS DEFINES  RENAISSANCE THIS HE REMARKS  IS NOT EXPLAINED BY THIS OR THAT CHARACTERISTIC BUT AS AN EFFORT FOR WHICH AT LENGTH THE TIME HAD COME TO REHEARSE EVEN IN THE MOST CURSORY MANNER THE HISTORY AND GROWTH OF THE WOMATS CLUB MOVEMENT WOULD BE OUT OF PLACE IN A PUBLICATION OF THIS KIND SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT FROM THE SMALL BEGINNING OF THE UNION OF A FEW SCATTERED LITERARY CLUBS CALLED TOGETHER BY SOROSIS OF NEW YORK IN I889 CAME THE I99THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY 2 FOLLOWING YEAR THE ORGANIZATION OF THE GENERAL FEDERATION OF WOMENS CLUBS THE GREAT STATE FEDERATIONS SOMETIMES NUMBER ING FORTY THOUSAND IN MEMBERSHIP AND THE WONDERFUL INCREASE IN INDIVIDUAL CLUB ORGANIZATION TODAY THE GENERAL FEDERATION HAS A MEMBERSHIP OF APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND WOMEN EX TENDING INTO ALMOST EVERY TOWN AND CITY IN OUR OWN LAND AND EMBRACING IN ITS UNION CLUBS IN NEARLY EVERY FOREIGN COUNTRY IT WAS SOON EVIDENT TO THE LEADERS AND STUDENTS OF THIS RENAISSANCE SO EAGERLY EMBRACED SO INSTANTLY GRASPED SO GREED ILY ABSORBED THAT LITERARY STUDY AND MUTUAL AND SELFIMPROVEMENT ALONE AS A FOUNDATION WOULD NOT BUILD A PERMANENT STRUCTURE GRADUALLY BUT SURELY AND SANELY THE WOMEN OF THE FEDERATION ARE COMING TO BELIEVE THAT THIS UNION OF FORCES IS HERE NOT A HAP PENING NOT FOR A FEW YEARS BUT THAT IT IS A PART OF THE PLAN OF THE WORLD THAT IT IS A GREAT HELPFUL UPLIFTING INFLUENCE FOR THE MAKING OF THE KINGDOM THE KINGDOM OF ENLARGED OPPORTUNITIES OF HIGHER IDEALS OF THE REDEEMING SPIRIT WHICH CAN HAVE NO BETTER WORD EXPRESSION THAN THE MOTTO OF THE FEDERATION UNITY IN DIVERSITY AT THE PRESENT TIME A STAGE OF EVOLUTION HAS BEEN REACHED BY WHICH THE OUTSIDE WORK OF THE FEDERATION IS CARRIED ON BY TWELVE STANDING COMMITTEES TO ENUMERATE ALL THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE GENERAL FEDERATION THRU THESE COMMITTEES WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE BUT A GLANCE AT A FEW OF THEIR ACTIVITIES MAY NOT BE WITHOUT INTEREST THE ART COMMITTEE HAS SENT HUNDREDS OF PICTURES OVER THE COUNTRY FOR SCHOOLS LIBRARIES AND INTO REMOTE AND LONELY HOMES GREAT PRACTICAL SERMONS HAVE BEEN PREACHED BY LOAN EXHIBITIONS OF ORIGINALS BY CLASSES UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE CLUBS BY PREACHING THE DOCTRINE OF GOOD ART OR NO ART IN THE DECORA TION OF PUBLIC BUILDINGS THE ERECTION OF MONUMENTS PARK GATES DRINKING FOUNTAINS ETC PERHAPS THE MOST FARREACHING WORK IN SPIRED BY THE FEDERATION HAS BEEN THE PLACING OF WORKS OF ART UPON THE WALLS OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND THE FORMATION OF SCHOOL ART LEAGUES IN ONE SMALL TERRITORY WHERE DISTANCES WERE GREAT AND EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES MOST LIMITED EVERY SCHOOL RECEIVED TWO FINE PICTURES THROUGH THE GENEROUS EFFORTS OF THE CLUB WOMEN OF THE TERRITORY ONE LARGE DEPARTMENT CLUB IN A WESTERN CITY HAS EXPENDED TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN SCHOOLROOM DECORATION EXAM 200MEANING OF THE WOMANS CLUB MOVEMENT PLES OF THIS KIND COULD BE GIVEN IN GREAT NUMBERS THE NEXT STEP ASKED OF CLUBS AND FEDERATIONS WILL BE THE ENDEAVOR TO HAVE A MUNICIPAL ART COMMISSION IN EVERY SMALL TOWN TO SERVE WITHOUT SALARY TO BE COMPOSED OF MEN AND WOMEN OF EXPERIENCE AND CULTIVATION SO THAT THE ADORNMENT OF MUNICIPALITIES MAY BE IN THE HANDS OF EXPERTS AND NOT LEFT TO THE SELECTION OF SUPERVISORS OR ALDERMEN WHO MAY HAPPEN TO BE IN OFFICE UPON THE CREST OF A PARTISAN WAVE THIS WILL BE THE KEYSTONE IN THE LAYING OF A FOUN DATION TO MAKE AMERICA ARTISTIC AS A NATION UNDER THE HEAD OF CIVICS  THERE IS ALMOST NO LIMIT TO THE WORK DONE BY CLUBS AND FEDERATIONS IN BEAUTIFYING STREETS IN STUDYING AND CARRYING OUT SANITARY MEASURES IN ESTABLISHING PARKS AND MUNICIPAL PLAY GROUNDS IN PRESERVING SACRED HISTORICAL SPOTS AND NATURAL GLORIES TWO NOTABLE EXAMPLES OF THE WORK OF THE CLUBS IN THE LATTER INSTANCE ARE THE PROTECTION OF THE PALISADES AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE  MESA VERDE  NATIONAL PARK BY THE PRESENT CONGRESS FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THE CLIFF DWELLINGS IN COLORADO PERHAPS THE BEST RESULT OF THE CIVICS COMMITTEE WORK IS THE KNOWLEDGE AC QUIRED BY HYGIENIC CONDITIONS WHICH HELPS US TO BETTER OUR HOMES AS WELL THIS IS A GLIMPSE OF THE WORK OF THE CIVIC COMMITTEES THE THIRD COMMITTEE ON CIVIL SERVICE REFORM IS COMPARATIVELY NEW IT IS NOT PROPOSED TO TAKE UP THE GREAT UNSOLVED QUESTIONS OF NATIONAL AND MUNICIPAL CIVIL SERVICE BUT THE SCOPE OF THIS COMMITTEE IS TO BRING TO CITIZENS A CAREFUL STUDY OF THE INSTITUTIONS IN WHICH ARE HOUSED THE DEPENDENT THE DELINQUENT AND THE DE FECTIVE  THE HELPLESS MEMBERS OF THE BODY POLITIC HUNDREDS OF WOMEN AND MEN AS WELL HAVE GIVEN OF THEIR LEISURE AT THE INSTIGA TION OF THIS COMMITTEE TO LOOK INTO THE CONDITION OF THEIR STATE INSTITUTIONS TO ASK THRU THE PRESS AND PUBLIC THAT ONLY MERIT SHALL BE CONSIDERED IN THE APPOINTMENTS AND THAT THESE HELPLESS SISTERS AND BROTHERS SHALL NO LONGER BE VICTIMS OF THE SPOILS SYS TEM MUCH IMPROVEMENT AND LASTING INTEREST HAS ALREADY BEEN THE RESULT THE EDUCATIONAL COMMITTEE IS INDUCING A CAREFUL STUDY OF THE CONDITIONS NOT OF YOUR CHILD AND MINE BUT OF ALL CHILDREN IT HAS FOUND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO EDUCATIONAL ADVANTAGES IN THIS GOOD LAND OF OURS AND IS WORKING TO ROUSE PUBLIC OPINION TO MEET THIS MIGHTY PROBLEM THE EDUCATIONAL WORK IN THE CLUBS HAS BROUGHT INTO LOVING RELATIONS TEACHER AND PARENT BEEN THE 201 3THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY MEANS OF PLACING WOMEN UPON SCHOOL BOARDS OF OBTAINING RIGHT FUL UNPAID TAXES TO MAINTAIN SCHOOLS OF ESTABLISHING SCHOLARSHIPS AND OF MUCH OTHER WONDERFUL WORK THE FIFTH COMMITTEE CALLED HOUSEHOLD ECONOMICS HAS ENDEAV ORED TO INTEREST THE WOMEN OF THE FEDERATION IN THE PRACTICAL PROBLEMS CONFRONTING THE HOUSEKEEPER THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE MEMBERS OF THE CLUBS AND FEDERATIONS ARE THE HOMEMAKERS THE THOUGHTFUL EARNEST MOTHERS AND WIVES WHO ARE GIVING THEIR BEST EFFORTS TO THE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEMS OF THEIR OWN AND THEIR CHILDRENS LIVES THEY ARE THE GRAND ARMY THE MAJORITY THE NINETY PER CENT WHO MAKE THE SPLENDID STURDY AMERICANISM WHICH MUST BE THE HOPE OF THE FUTURE THE PURE FOOD COMMITTEE NUMBER SIX IS ALSO OF RECENT BIRTH BUT IF ITS LIFE SHALL CONTINUE TO BE AS VIGOROUS AS HAS BEEN ITS EARLY PROMISE IT WILL INDEED BE SAID OF IT THAT IT IS  BORN WELL AND WELL BORN EVEN THE MOST ABSOLUTE UNBELIEVERS IN THE PUBLIC WORK OF WOMEN HAVE ADMITTED THAT THE WORK OF THE FEDERATION THROUGH ITS CENTRAL AND STATE COMMITTEES HAS BEEN OF POTENT INFLUENCE IN PASSING THE FEDERAL MEASURE KNOWN AS THE PURE FOOD BILL THE NEXT STEP WILL BE AN EFFORT FOR SIMILAR LEGISLATION IN THE RESPECTIVE STATES IN ORDER TO MAKE THE NATIONAL LAW EFFECTIVE THE FORESTRY COMMITTEE HAS A CORRESPONDENT IN EACH STATE FEDERATION OF WHICH THERE ARE NOW FORTYSIX SO VALIANT AND IN CREASING HAS BEEN THE WARFARE WAGED IN THIS CAUSE THAT AT THE PRESENT TIME NEARLY EVERYSTATE IS AROUSED TO THE NEED OF LEGISLATION AND WORK FOR THE PROTECTION OF THESE NECESSARY ADJUNCTS TO CIVIL IZATION AND HAPPINESS THE WOODS AND FORESTS THE INDUSTRIAL AND CHILD LABOR COMMITTEE DESERVES AN ENTIRE ARTICLE IF WE WOULD TELL HOW IT HAS GONE INTO THE LIVES OF THE WORKERS INVESTIGATING HELPING GIVING A GENUINE UPLIFT IN HUNDREDS OF CASES COMING NOW TO DEMAND A CENSUS OF CONDITIONS FROM THE NATION ITSELF PERHAPS THE MOST EFFECTIVE WORK DONE BY THIS COMMITTEE HAS BEEN THE AWAKENING OF MANY STATES TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE CON DITIONS OF WORKERS WITHIN THEIR BORDERS STATE PRIDE ENTERS SO LARGELY INTO THE COMPOSITION OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT IT HAS BEEN A LONG AND ARDUOUS TASK TO EVEN OBTAIN AN ADMITTANCE TO THE IDEA THAT LIKE COMMONWEALTHS INDIVIDUALS HAVE GRIEVOUS DISTEM PERS AND NEED AT TIMES EVEN THE SURGEONS KNIFE THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE OTHER COM 202 4MEANING OF THE WOMANS CLUB MOVEMENT MITTEES HAS FOUGHT HEROICALLY FOR THE JUVENILE COURT LAWS WHICH NOW PREVAIL IN TWENTYFIVE STATES FOR HUMANE LEGISLATION FOR THE ENACTMENT OF JUST PROPERTY LAWS FOR WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND FOR THE STATUTES WHICH SHALL PROTECT THE HOME AND PURIFY COMMUNITY AND STATE THE LIBRARY EXTENSION COMMITTEE PERHAPS AT THIS MOMENT THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND BOOKS BEING SENT OVER THIS LAND BOOKS TO THE LONELY BOOKS TO THE IGNORANT BOOKS TO HELP AND INSTRUCT AND REVIVE IN NUMBERS OF CASES THE INCEPTION OF A CARNEGIE LIBRARY BUILDING HAS BEEN THE SMALL WOMANS CLUB FREE LIBRARY IN THE TOWN OR CITY IN ONE SMALL STATE FEDERATION OF FORTY CLUBS IN MEMBERSHIP THIRTY HAD FOUNDED FREE LIBRARIES GIVING TIME MEANS AND MOST UNSELFISH SERVICE IN MAINTAINING THEM NO GREATER ADVANCE CAN BE MADE IN THE GROWTH OF A NATION THAN BY WORK OF THIS NATURE FOR THE DISSEMINATION OF GOOD LITERATURE MEANS THE OVERCOMING OF IGNORANCE AND ITS TRAIN OF DISASTER AND DYNA MITE A NEW COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AT THE RECENT BIENNIAL WILL BE CALLED THE  OUTLOOK  COMMITTEE TO WHOM SHALL BE REFERRED FOR INVESTIGATION NEW WORK OR PLANS PROPOSED TO THE FEDERATION WE CAN GIVE ONLY THIS GLANCE AT THE WORK OF THE GENERAL FEDERATION OF WOMENS CLUBS OMITTING AS IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE THE MIGHTY STIMULUS GIVEN TO LITERARY STUDY AND WORK BY MEANS OF THE RESPECTIVE LITERARY CLUBS AND LITERATURE COMMITTEES NOT EVEN GLANCING AT THE WONDERFUL LIVING VALUE OF THE FEDERATION IN BRINGING TO WOMEN THE COMMUNITY IDEA THE FELLOWSHIP WHICH ROUNDS AND DEVELOPS CHARACTER THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE STUDENT HABIT THEREBY KEEPING THE MOTHER ABREAST OF HER CHILDREN THE TEACH ING OF THE REAL THINGS OF LIFE THE GIVING OF PURPOSE AND HEALTHFUL ACTIVITIES TO MANY OTHERWISE LONELY OR USELESS LIVES THESE ACHIEVE MENTS MAY NOT BE RECORDED BY PEN OR PRINT BUT THEY WILL GO FAR IN THE MAKING OF THE COMING MEN AND WOMEN IN THE FINAL ESTIMATE IF WE DEFINE THIS ORGANIZATION IF WE REPLY TO THE OFTREPEATED QUESTION WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE FEDERA TION WE SHOULD ANSWER THE GENERAL FEDERATION OF WOMENS CLUBS IS NOT A REFORM ORGANIZATION PER SE IT IS BROADLY SYMPA THETIC WITH REFORM BUT IT IS NOT A PROPAGANDA IT IS NOT PHILAN THROPIC DISTINCTIVELY THOUGH ONE OF THE GREATEST AGENCIES OF THE DAY FOR CAREFUL STUDY OF METHODS AND GENUINE HELPFULNESS IN THIS DIRECTION IT IS NOT PURELY SOCIOLOGICAL THOUGH WITH LIVING INTER 203 5THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY ESTS AND A SPLENDID RECORD OF SERVICE IN UPLIFTING WORK IT IS IN NO SENSE POLITICAL YET ITS INFLUENCE AND POWER ARE TO BE SEEN IN EVERY STATE LEGISLATURE AND IT HAS THE PROUD BOAST OF HAVING BEEN A GREAT FACTOR IN PASSING THE LONG DISPUTED PURE FOOD BILL DURING THE PRESENT SESSION OF CONGRESS IT CANNOT BE CALLED AN ACADEMY OR MUSEUM OF ART YET ONE OF THE GREATEST AUTHORITIES OF THE AGE HAS SAID THAT THE YEARS OF STUDY AND DEMONSTRATION IN THE CLUBS AND FEDERATIONS HAVE PRODUCED THE WONDERFUL RESULTS SHOWN IN THE SCHOOL ROOM DECORATION AND MUCH OF THE ARTS AND CRAFTS MOVEMENT BY WHICH A GENUINE LOVE FOR AND KNOWLEDGE OF ART IS BEING INSTILLED INTO THE COMING MEN AND WOMEN IT IS NOT A UNIVERSITY YET A SURPRISING STIMULUS HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THE STUDY OF LITERATURE SCIENCE AND HISTORY IN HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF AMERICAN HOMES BECAUSE OF THE CLUB MEMBERSHIP OF MOTHER OR DAUGHTER IT HAS NO BUREAU OF PUBLICITY YET THROUGH ITS MEMBERSHIP OF CLUBS AND FEDERATIONS IT HAS BEEN MORE FARREACHING IN DISSEMINATING KNOWLEDGE AND AROUS ING PUBLIC SENTIMENT UPON THE QUESTIONS WHICH MAKE FOR GOOD CITIZENSHIP THAN ANY OTHER BODY OF WORKERS BECAUSE OF ITS BROAD INCLUSIVE LINES AND WIDER OUTLOOK THE FEDERATION MAY BECOME A MIGHTY FACTOR IN THE CIVILIZATION OF THE CENTURY IF WIELDED AS A WHOLE AN ARMY OF BUILDERS READY ALERT SYSTEMATIC AND SCIENTIFIC NOT ONLY A POTENT FORCE IN THIS GENERATION BUT TRANSMITTING TO THE NEXT A VIGOR AND STRENGTH WHICH HAVE NEVER BEEN GIVEN BY ANY RACE OF WOMEN TO THEIR INHERITORS 204 6

City As colonizers in the practical acceptation of the word Ameri cans are not and never can be successful because of their too idealistic aspirations Despite the general belief that the acquisi tion of the almighty dollar is the height of our ambition the aims of all American military expeditions throughout our entire history have been absolutely altrusticalways for the elevation of the down trodden or the relief of the victims of former tyranny We have constantly endeavored to create selfrespecting selfsupporting citi zens capable of appreciating liberty and of intelligently exercising that greatest of all blessings selfgovernment Can history furnish a parallel to Americas disinterested emanci pation of Cuba from Spain undertaking a war with a power once so great that it dominated the world shedding the blood of its freeborn citizens and expending a round billion from its treasury with unexampled prodigality Then after stamping out tyranny the conquest was completed and the island was put in sanitary condi tion and transferred to a liberated people giving them their lands their cities and their homes together with a promise of protection from other powers through the Monroe doctrine without saddling the country with a financial claim of indemnity for one single cent Would this have been the policy of the other great colonizing countries of the world The recent example of the socalled Powers in Africa does not tend to prove it Since the wonderful discoveries of Livingston which imparted so great a stimulus to the possibilities of that country there has been going on in that vast domain a carnival of territorial lust unprecedented in history It culminated about twenty years ago in the socalled partitioning of the continent by the powers who in their division of the spoils followed like the robbers of feudal times The good old rule the simple plan That they should take who have the power And they should keep who can 130The Problem of the Philippines And what has been done there in the name of civilization to justify this wholesale loot this robbery of a continent Very little beyond the systematized collection of taxes so onerous as practically to reduce the natives xto abject servitude No consideration was paid to the natural geographic lines of the continent its mountains or rivers its tribes its commerce or its potentialities and in this monstrous bargain the rights of the natives received no more con sideration than did those of the monkey A similar spoliation on a somewhat smaller scale would have occurred with the Middle Kingdom after the Boxer war had not the diplomacy of Europe been defeated The allied armies of eight nations were there waiting watching each other like hungry buz zards for the final dissolution of the sick man of the far East when they thought another opportunity would offer for a renewal of their feasting on the carcass and for an extension of their terri torial spheres But the ringing policy of John Hay demanding the preservation of the entity of China and the maintenance of the policy of the open door won and the people of that unhappy land were rescued from the fate of the helpless and almost hopeless African of today And let it never be forgotten they were rescued by America On the occasion of the second and recent outbreak in Cuba when internal dissensions disturbed the peace and order of that country and made an army of intervention necessary did America take advantage of the opportunity to seize that gem of the Antilles to make it tributary to its treasury And the Philippines did we seek them for territorial aggran dizement God forbid They fell to us as the unexpected but legitimate result of war and by treaty paid for with clean American gold Twice I have visited these islands once as an active partici pant in the wretched war that began in I898 and which is likely to continue intermittingly for centuries if the testimony of almost every army officer who has served there can be accepted or if we remain there for so long But since our occupation has the real motive of America been selfish Of the hundreds of millions sunk in that land of treachery and savagery it is doubtful whether America will ever reap the benefit of so much as the price of the homeward passage for its army Was it a steppingstone for the trade of the Orient that we I3lThe Annals of the American Academy retained possession The oldest and most respected American mer chant in China one who has spent forty years in the Orient and has represented his government in various important capacities said to me while discussing this point As well might America regard the Bermudas or the Canary Isles as steppingstones for the English French or German trade of Europe as to acquire the Philippines for the advancement of trade in the East Instead of a help they are a direct menace requir ing protection and causing international jealousies and in case of war would be a constant source of gravest danger because of their great distance from our base Is it for gold that our thousand school teachers are now drawing salaries to educate these semisavage deceitful Malays tainted with Spanish cross who for centuries will be unable to eradicate the treacherous and cowardly instincts of their race By the same path must ye walk is true today as it was two thousand years ago The continuity of history cannot be broken a people cannot break with its past immemorial heredity must be remembered To suppose that from the lowbred Filipino there could be evolved in a single generation one worthy or competent to exercise self government is to defy every law of anthropology and natural selection and to indulge in the wildest optimism Is it possible to believe that such a creaturethe natural product of his tropical environmentwhose evolution has taken ages for the development of the instincts of cunning and treachery and of the characteristics and qualities that have enabled him to preserve his existence in the land of the tiger and the vipercould be suddenly translated into a selfgovering citizen The AngloSaxon of temperate clime has required many centuries of natural selection to evolve from his savagery As the caveman he too was full of ferocity guarding his home and his family and his life Evolving from the dark ages through feudal days assisted by the teaching and traditions of the Church the example of Greece and Rome and the Free Cities of Europe profiting by the lessons of the Reformation the influence of the thought of great leaders like Erasmus Luther Gustavus Adolphus by long wars for the vindication of right by Magna Charta the printing press the drama the French Revolution and our own revolution through all these things he gradually developed from ignorance and superstition into a thinking selfgoverning 132The Problem of the Philippines man But this development required a thousand yearsthe golden thousand since creationto free him from his ignorance and mortal serfdom and to prepare him to rule himself Is the African or Malay savage so infinitely the intellectual superior of the Cau casian that he can emerge from his savagery into this sphere of civilization and attain this rich inheritance in a single decade Is this selfgoverning ability which is not yet overdeveloped among usas the resident of any great American city must confess to be hypodermically injected in concentrated essence into the ignorant treacherous lowbred Filipino by bullets or prayerbooks or schoolhouses in a generation to qualify him for beneficent assimi lation The suggestion is preposterous I believe the most practical solution of the Philippine problem if the American people are foolish enough to continue their ex travagant experiment there or if we are not relieved of the re sponsibility of the islands by neutralizing them or through some foreign complicationis to allow them to follow the course of natural selection through the importation of the Chinaman His exclusion from these islands was a diplomatic blunder comparable only with the treatment of the Oriental on our Pacific coast at the instigation of the sandlot orators charlatan politicians and the yel low journalism of California When I was last in the Philippines there were somewhat over one hundred thousand Chinese there who formed by far the most industrious class of the inhabitants The Chinese Mestizo half Chinese and half Filipino is acknowledged to be superior to the Eurasian or Mestizo of Oriental crossJapanese Hindoo or Bornese Many of them were wealthy bankers or merchants Others were engaged as compradors or clerks banking houses employing them almost to the exclusion of all other national ities on account of their quick wit sterling honesty industry and individual merit As in the Hawaiian Islands they formed the most valuable element of the population The Chinese Hawaiian halfcaste is the keenest business man and the most industrious citizen to be found in those islands The exclusion of the Chinese laborer in that land will do inestimable damage in retarding in dustrial and commercial development Despite his fanaticism when directed by ignorant rulers he has shown his superiority over other Orientals in his untiring industry iis domesticity and his honesty In the large foreign houses or business houses of China and Japan I33The Annals of the American Academy he was the trusted employee in places requiring responsibility When put in competition with the Bornese the Filipino the Cingalese the Hawaiian the Japanese or the Indian he invariably wins as may be seen by his rise from poverty to wealth and in fluence in the cities of Singapore Calcutta Sandakan Manila Honolulu or Yokohoma It is time America recognized that in the great race of civilization and the greater race for the survival of the fittest the nation that has preserved the integrity of its government for over six thousand years that has witnessed the rise and fall of the civilizations of Chaldea Egypt Greece and Rome that can claim the discovery of the compass of gunpowder the game of chess and the printing press and that gave birth to that great philosopher who five hundred years before the coming of Christ propounded and exemplified the doctrine do not do unto others what you would not have others do unto you is more to be respected for its virtues than feared for its vices The presence of the China man in the Philippineswith the substitution of its characteristics of honesty domesticity and industry for the dishonesty laziness and treachery of the Filipinoswill do more to promote the indus trial development and the civilization of these islands than any other factor and the sooner America appreciates this fact and acts upon it the more prompt will be her relief from her present embarrassing position Uncle Sam has paid and is paying dearly for his experiment and the privilege of protecting the trade of his distant possessions for the benefit of England Germany and Japan Some day he will tire of the constant drain on his treasury and his army and remove these islands from the arena of politics and the natural law of evolution will prevailand many there are who will welcome the coming of that day When these facts are remembered the world will be justified in its characterization of our Oriental development Foreigners are watching the progress of our colonial experiment there with keenest interest And I believe unless our policy is changed it will prove a lamentable failure and therefore establish a disastrous precedent for the attempted elevation of the blacks This will be the more unfortunate because the experiment radically differs from all others in that its aims are purely altruistic I34

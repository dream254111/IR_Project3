THE DAUGHTER WAS ABOUT TWENTY ONE OF A SANGUIN COMPLEXION AND AS TO PRIVATE MATTERS WELL ENOUGH SHE HAD BEEN FOR SEVERAL DAYS LESS ACTIVE THAN USUAL AND AFTER THAT HAD A WEEK BEFORE I SAW HER LOST HER SPEECH AND THE USE OF HER LEGS SHE REELD LIKE A PERSON DRUNK AND WAS BY THOSE WHO KNEW NOT HER CONDITION OFTEN TAKEN TO BE SO BUT I THINK UN JUSTLY FOR SHE HAD NEITHER MONEY NOR INTERES TO MAKE HER SO IN HER LEGS THERE WAS LITTLE OR NO SENSE OF FEELING HER LEST LEG WAS DRAWN UP AS IN A VIOLENT CRAMP HER RUDDY SANGUIN LOOK DIRECTED BLEEDING BUT THAT DID NOT RELIEVE HER I THEN GAVE HER SPIRIT OF SAL

OFF ON TUESDAYS EVERY WEEK AND RETURNING ON SATURDAYS WITH ONLY TWO EXCEPTIONS VIZ THAT ONCE THEY RETURNED ON A FRIDAY ANOTHER TIME NOT BEFORE SUNDAY SHE TELLS ME THAT HER DAUGHTER WAS THE PRECEDING WINTER VERY WEAK AND IN DANGER OF DEATH THAT HER APPETITE WAS MUCH ABATED THAT SHE SOMETIMES CHOSE TO EAT BREAD WATER AND SALT BOYLD TOGETHER THAT  NOW259 NOW AS THE SUMMER CAME ON SHE RECOVERED SOME DE GREE OF STRENGTH THAT SHE HAD LOST NO SENSE AT ANY TIME BESIDES THAT OF FEELING WHICH WAS BY THE FIRST QUANTITY OF MEDICINES RESTORED EFFECTUALLY AND WITHOUT RELAPSE I UNDERSTAND FROM HER THAT THE MENSES WERE REGULAR AS TO PERIOD BUT AS TO QUANTITY UNEQUAL WITH THIS FARTHER OBSERVABLE THAT WHEN THEY WERE MOST SHE THE DAUGHTER WAS WORST I WAS INFORMD ALSO THAT BEFORE HER SPEECH USED TO GO OFF SHE CONSTANTLY LOST FOR AN HOURS SPACE THE USE OF HER LEFT ARM THAT WHEN HER SPEECH WAS LEAVING HER SHE WOULD STAMMER OUT SOME FEW WORDS AND AFTER THIS ON A SUDDEN BECAME MUTE THAT WHEN NOT ABLE TO SPEAK SHE OFTEN MOAND AND MADE A MELANCHOLLY COMPLAINING NOISE THAT HER SPEECH DID USE TO RETURN AS IT WENT OFF ALL ON A SUDDEN AND AT ONCE SHE ALWAYS HAD AS HER SPEACH CEASD AND TWO HOURS AFTER IT WAS GONE A PAIN IN HER LEFT SIDE INCLUDING ARM AND LEG HER LEFT FOOT WAS THEN DRAWN UP AS BEFORE MENTIONED HER FACE WAS HIGH COLOURD WHEN SHE LOST HER SPEECH PALE WHEN IT RETURND NO PART OF HER BO DY WITHERD BUT SHE WHOLE WAS GENERALLY COLD SOME TIME BEFORE SHE WAS AT FIRST STRUCK SPEECHLESS HER HANDS USED TO TREMBLE BUT HAVE BEEN OF LATE MORE STEDDY NOR WAS SHE NOW SO DULL AND HEAVY AS FORMER LY BUT FOR THE GENERALITY MORE BRISK AND CHEARFUL THAN IN HER STATE OF HEALTH WHEN SHE HAS HER SPEECH SHE GOES BEST BUT IS ALWAYS FORCD TO USE A STICK BEING NEVER ABLE TO GO STEDDILY SHE SPEAKS BY INTERVALS AS DISTINCTLY AS EVER AND AS LOUD CAN SING WHEN CAPABLE OF SPEAKING BUT AT NO OTHER TIME Q  2 THIS260 THIS ACCOUNT THE MOTHER GIVES ME OF HER DAUGHTER DELIVERING IT WITH A GREAT DEAL OF COUNTRY SIMPLICITY WHICH RECOMMENDED WHAT SHE SAID AS TO HER SELF I FOUND SHE SOMETIMES HAD CONVULSIVE FITS AND THO A POOR LABOURING WOMAN WAS EXTREAMLY HYSTERICAL I AT THE SAME TIME OBSERVD THE DAUGHTER TO HAVE A PALE SICKLY LOOK A HEAVY EYE A LOW PULSE AND TO BE MUCH WASTED IN FLESH SHE CONTINUED IN MY NEIGHBOUR HOOD ABOUT TWO MONTHS CURIOSITY AS WELL AS CHARI TY PROMPTED ME TO SEE HER OFTEN I DID SEE HER ALMOST EVERY DAY FOR THE WHOLE TIME I MADE BOTH MOTHER AND DAUGHTER FREQUENTLY REPEAT TO ME THE MANNER OF THE FITS AND BY CROSS INTERROGATORIES ENDEAVOURED TO CATCH THEM IN DIFFERING STORIES BUT THEIR ACCOUNTS WERE IN SUBSTANCE ALWAYS THE SAME I ENDEAVOURD TO DISCOVER SOME MATTER OF FACT WHICH MIGHT DISPROVE THEM AND TO THAT INTENT EXAMIND THOSE WHO WERE NEAR THEM BUT COULD LIGHT ON NO SUCH INSTANCE I THEN REPEATED THE FORMER COURSE FURNISHING HER WITH LARGE QUANTITIES OF HER OLD MEDICINES AND SO DIS MISSD HER WITH ORDERS TO LET ME HEAR AGAIN FROM HER WHEN THE PHYSICK SHOULD BE ALL SPENT IN SEPTEMBER 1688 SHE CAME WITH HER MOTHER FROM STOW TO OXON THAT IS ALMOST TWENTY MILES ON FOOT THANKD ME FOR WHAT I HAD DIRECTED HER AND BEGD A FARTHER SUPPLY OF MEDICINES SHE ACCORDINGLY HAD THEM AND BY THE 10TH OF NOV FOLLOWING WAS GROWN STRONG AND TO ALL APPEARANCE WELL AS EVER FOR TWO MONTHS THEN LAST PAST SHE DID GO AND SPEAK EVERY DAY BUT NOT AT ALL TIMES OF THE WEEK FOR HER SPEECH LEFT HER AS FORMERLY ON TUESDAYS BUT NOW RETURND THE NEXT DAY AFTER NOON THUS SHE CONTINUED TO THE SUMMER FOLLOWING NOT SPEAKING IN MORE THAN TWENTY MONTHS ON ANY ONE WEDNESDAY MORNING IN261 IN THE SUMMER 1689 HOPING TO COMPLEAT THE CURE I PROCURED BY MEANS OF A CONTRIBUTION MADE ON PUR POSE FOR HER A LARGE STOCK OF MEDICINES FOR THE WINTER FOLLOWING BUT SINCE THAT SUMMER HAVE HEARD NOTHING MORE OF HER THERE WERE SEVERAL OPINIONS CONCERNING THIS YOUNG WOMAN SOME YOU WILL EASILY IMAGIN THOUGHT HER BE WITCHD OTHERS THAT SHE COUNTERFEITED BUT THE FA VOURERS OF ONE AND THE OTHER OF THESE OPINIONS WERE EQUALLY STRANGERS TO HER CASE CAN IT BE SUPPOSED THAT A GIRL OF VERY ORDINARY UN DERSTANDING AS INDEED THIS WAS AND A RUSTICK EDUCA TION SHOULD LEAVE A COURSE OF LIVING TOLERABLY WELL AND TO THE GREAT PREJUDICE OF HER HEALTH AND DANGER OF HER LIFE CARRY ON FOR THE SPACE OF TWO YEARS A HUMOUR WHICH DEPRIVD HER OF SO MUCH CONVERSATION AND BROUGHT BOTH HER AND HER MOTHER TO SUCH EXCESSIVE HARDSHIPS AND NECESSITIES EXTRAORDINARY CHOOSE AT THE SAME TIME TO TAKE VAST QUANTITIES OF PHYSICK FOR SUCH SHE WAS SEEN TO TAKE GAIN GROUND UNDER THE USE OF THAT PHYSICK AND IN PROPORTION TO IT LOSE THAT GROUND AGAIN UPON OMITTING REGAIN IT UPON RESUMING HER PHYSICK AND THIS EVIDENTLY MANIFESTLY AND FREQUENTLY AND YET ALL THIS WHILE DISSEMBLE SIR I BEG LEAVE TO SAY I THINK IT WAS NOT IN HER POWER SO TO DO INDEED CREDULITY ARGUES WEAKNESS OF MIND AND IS DESERVEDLY ATTENDED WITH REPROACH IT IS OFFENSIVE TO PHILOSOPHY WHOSE VENERABLE RECORDS IT INTERLINES WITH FALSE STORIES AND IDLE TALES BUT ON THE OTHER HAND TIS ALSO TRUE THAT SCEPTICISM IS NOT LESS A FAULT FOR THAT ALONE RENDERS THE WHOLE BOOK OF NATURE INSIGNIFICANT WHAT CAN THE CLEAREST EXPERIMENT OR THE BEST DISCOVERY IMPORT TO HIM WHO WILL NOT HEAR WHO WILL NOT SEE EXON JUNE 4 1698  OF

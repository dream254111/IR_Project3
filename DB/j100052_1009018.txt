J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1009018,BULLION NOTES AND AN ELASTIC CURRENCY,I242486,BULLION NOTES AND AN ELASTIC CURRENCY 99 ABOUT IOO HAD BEEN DEPOSITED AND THEN CEASED ALTOGETHER BUT THE MOST EXTREME CASE WAS WHERE A GIRL DEPOSITED IOO AT ONE TIMEA PRESENT FROM HER FATHER WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT SHE WAS TO SAVE IT SUCH THINGS AS THESE INDICATE THAT PARENTS ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE HIGH INTEREST PAID AND ARE DEPOSITING FOR INVESTMENT THOUGH THIS DOES NOT DIRECTLY INJURE ANY ONE YET IT COMPELS THE TEACHERS TO KEEP BOOKS FOR PEOPLE BETTER OFF THAN THEY AND HAS LIKEWISE A TENDENCY TO DIS COURAGE THOSE WHO CAN NOT DEPOSIT SUCH HEAVY SUMS WITH THE ONE DOLLAR LIMIT MORE STRICTLY ADHERED TO THIS WOULD BE AN EXCEEDINGLY SUC CESSFUL SCHOOL SAVINGS BANK W F HARDING INDIANAPOLIS IND BULLION NOTES AND AN ELASTIC CURRENCY IN THE APRIL NUMBER OF THE FORUM MR JOSE F DE NAVARRO PRO POSES INSTEAD OF THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF SILVER CERTIFICATES AND TREASURY NOTES REDEEMABLE IN SILVER DOLLARS TO SUBSTITUTE A SYSTEM OF BULLION NOTES REDEEMABLE IN SILVER BULLION AT THE GOLD PRICE OF SILVER ON THE DAY OF PAYMENT THIS IS ESSENTIALLY THE PLAN SUBMITTED TO CONGRESS IN I889 BY SECRETARY WINDOM WHO PROPOSED TO RESTRICT THE ISSUE OF THESE BULLION NOTES TO THE YEARLY COMMERCIAL VALUE OF THE PRODUCT OF THE AMERICAN MINES THIS WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN AN ANNUAL INCREASE OF THE CURRENCY OF ABOUT 55000000 57600040 IN I891 ALL THE ADVAN TAGES OF THE PLAN AS CLAIMED BY MR DE NAVARRO MAY BE READILY CON CEDED IT WOULD CHECK AT ONCE THE SCARE ABOUT THE LOSS OF OUR GOLD IN FACT WITH SUCH A SYSTEM OF CURRENCY THE UNITED STATES COULD DISPENSE WITH GOLD ALTOGETHER THIS IS A CONTINGENCY HOWEVER WHICH NEITHER SECRETARY WINDOM NOR MR DE NAVARRO SEEMS TO HAVE CONSIDERED SAFE OR ALLOWABLE YET FURTHER CONSIDERATION WILL SHOW THAT HAVING ADOPTED THE SYSTEM OF BULLION NOTES EVERY DOLLAR OF GOLD NOW ON HAND MIGHT BE EXPORTED TO EUROPE AND EVERY NEW OUNCE FROM THE MINES MIGHT FOLLOW IT YET EVERY DOLLAR OF AMERICAN CURRENCY WOULD BE AS GOOD AS A GOLD DOLLAR SHOULD ALL THE GOLD LEAVE THE COUNTRY IN THIS WAY CABLEGRAM REPORTS FROM LONDON EVERY DAY WOULD GIVE THE GOLD PRICE OF SILVER JUST AS THE DIRECTOR OF THE MINT TODAY RECEIVES PRICES TO GUIDE HIM IN THE PURCHASE OF BULLION UNDER THE ACT OF I890 EVERY BULLION NOTE PRESENTED TO THE TREASURY WOULD BE REDEEMED IN SILVER BULLION AT THE WORLDS GOLD PRICE OF SILVER ON THAT DAY AND WOULD THEREFORE BE EQUAL TO A REDEMP TION IN GOLD ON THE MARKETS OF THE WORLD IF THESE PRINCIPLES BE TRUE MAY NOT THE UNITED STATES GO FURTHER AND ADOPT A SCIENTIFICALLY ELASTIC SYSTEM OF CURRENCY BASED ON BULLION NOTES  THE DISTINGUISHED SWISS PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL ECONOMY LDON WALRAS OF LAUSANNE SOME YEARS AGO PROPOSED A PLAN FOR AN ELASTIC CURRENCY AND SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME PLAN HAS BEEN ADVOCATED BY PRESIDENT E BENJAMIN ANDREWS OF BROWN UNIVERSITY ONE OF THE AMERICAN DELEGATES L2991OO ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY TO THE RECENT BRUSSELS CONFERENCE THE PLAN AS OUTLINED BY PRESI DENT ANDREWS IS AS FOLLOWS  THE ESTABLISHMENT OF GOLD AS THE UNIVERSAL UNIT OF VALUE THEN I THE CRITICAL ASCERTAINMENT OF THE COURSE OF PRICES 2 THE USE OF SOME FULL LEGAL TENDER MONEY LIKE SILVER REPRE SENTED BY CERTIFICATES AND 3 THE INJECTION OF A PORTION OF THIS INTO CIRCULATION OR THE WITHDRAWAL OF A PORTION THEREFROM ACCORDING AS PRICES HAD FALLEN OR RISEN THE COURSE OF PRICES SHOULD BE DETERMINED DAILY BY A COMMISSION THROUGH TELEGRAPHIC REPORTS FROM THE GREATER MARKETS STRESS BEING LAID ON THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS COMMODITIES MUST BE TAKEN FROM EACH OF THE TWO GREAT CLASSES THOSE SUBJECT AND THOSE NOT SUBJECT TO THE LAW OF DIMINISHING RETURNS AS FAR AS POSSIBLE IN THE PROPORTION WHICH EACH BEARS TO THE TOTAL CONSUMPTION   THOSE ARTICLES MUST BE CHOSEN WHICH ARE THE LEAST SUBJECT TO ACCIDENTAL AND ARTIFICIAL FLUCTUATIONS    THE GREATER THE NUMBER OF STAPLES THE BETTER    AS A RULE PRICES ARE TO BE REGISTERED IN ALL THE MAJOR MARKETS OF THE COUNTRY OR COUNTRIES WHOSE PRICES ARE IN QUESTION IN NOT A FEW CASES AS WHEAT AND STANDARD SILVER LONDON PRICES WOULD SERVE AS WELL FOR OTHER COUNTRIES AS FOR GREAT BRITIAN    THE FIFTH SPECIAL CONDITION IS THAT OF QUANTITY COEFFICIENTSAN ARRANGEMENT WHEREBY THE FIGURES FOR EACH COMMODITY ARE MADE TO ENTER INTO THE GRAND TOTAL A NUMBER OF TIMES IN PROPORTION TO THE QUANTITY OF IT CONSUMED HAVING IN THIS WAY FOUND AVERAGE PRICES BY AN INDEX NUMBER OR OTHERWISE IF THE AMOUNT AT ANY ADDITION IS GREATER THAN AT THE LAST GENERAL PRICES HAVE RISEN MONEY HAS GROWN CHEAPER HAS LOST IN PUR CHASING POWER TOO MUCH OF IT IS IN CIRCULATION SOME MUST BE WITH DRAWN IF ON THE CONTRARY THE AMOUNT IS LESS THAN AT THE LAST SUMMA TION PRICES HAVE FALLEN MONEY HAS GROWN DEARER HAS GAINED IN VALUE TOO LITTLE OF IT IS IN CIRCULATION AND MORE MUST BE SET FREE OR COINED TO REDRESS THE BALANCE IN A WORD INFLATE OR CONTRACT RAREFY OR CONDENSE SO AS TO KEEP THE FOOTING OF YOUR GREAT PRICE LIST PERPETUALLY THE SAME THERE IS ONE INSUPERABLE OBJECTION TO THIS SCHEME NAMELY THE PRO POSAL TO MAKE THE SUBSIDIARY MONEY A TOKEN MONEY PRESUMABLY LIKE OUR STANDARD SILVER DOLLAR THIS OBJECTION WOULD SHOW ITSELF BOTH WHEN PRICES ARE RISING AND WHEN THEY ARE FALLING IF PRICES WERE RISING THE GOVERNMENT COULD CONTRACT THE CURRENCY ONLY BY ISSUING BONDS REDEEM ABLE IN SILVER CERTIFICATES IT COULD NOT SELL THE SILVER FOR THE CERTIFICATES ON THE OTHER HAND IF WORLDPRICES SHOWED A CONTINUED TENDENCY TO FALL THE GOVERNMENT BY ITS CONSTANT INJECTION OF THESE DEPRECIATED COINS WOULD EVENTUALLY DRIVE ALL THE GOLD FROM THE COUNTRY AND PRICES WOULD BE BASED ON THE DEPRECIATED SILVER CONSEQUENTLY SINCE FALLING PRICES  AN HONEST DOLLAR P 36 PUBLICATIONS OF AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION VOL IV NO 6 300BULLION NOTES AND AN ELASTIC CURRENCY IOI ARE THE RULE TODAY THE SCHEME IF CARRIED OUT WOULD BRING THE SAME RESULTS AS FREE COINAGE IT CAN THEREFORE NEVER HOPE FOR SUCCESS EXCEPT BY AN INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT AND IS FURTHER OFF TODAY THAN SIMPLE INTERNATIONAL BIMETALLISM BUT THESE OBJECTIONS WOULD NOT HOLD IF THE SUBSIDIARY MONEY WERE BULLION NOTES REDEEMABLE IN SILVER BULLION AT THE CURRENT GOLD PRICE OF SILVER WITH SUCH AN AMENDMENT THE SCHEME OF PRESIDENT ANDREWS COULD BE CARRIED OUT WITH EMINENT SUCCESS BY THE UNITED STATES ALONE WE COULD BECOME THE GREAT REGULATOR OF WORLDPRICES AND NOT WITH GREAT LOSS SUCH AS FRANCE INCURRED WHEN SHE PLAYED THAT R61E UNDER SIMPLE BIMETALLISM BUT WITH UNEXAMPLED PROFIT OUR SIX HUNDRED MILLIONS OF GOLD WOULD GO ABROAD IN JUST THE QUANTITIES WE DESIRED AND KEEP UP EUROPES PRICES WHILE WE WOULD BE DOING BUSINESS ON A GOLD BASIS WITHOUT NEED OF THE GOLD THE MONETARY COMMISSION IF PRICES WERE FALLING WOULD PURCHASE SILVER BULLION AT ITS MARKET VALUE AT ANY FIGURE BELOW 129 PER OUNCE AND LEGALTENDER CERTIFICATES WOULD BE ISSUED IN PAYMENT THEREOF IN SUCH QUANTITIES AS WERE NECESSARY TO KEEP UP PRICES THEN AGAIN IF PRICES WERE RISING ABOVE THE STANDARD THE COMMISSION COULD SELL SILVER BULLION AT ITS MARKET VALUE AND COULD LOCK UP THE CERTIFICATES RECEIVED THEREFOR THUS CONTRACTING THE CUR RENCY WITHOUT THE ISSUE OF BONDS WITH THE EXPANSION OF THE COUN TRY HOWEVER IT IS LIKELY THAT THE PURCHASE OF BULLION RATHER THAN ITS SALE WOULD BE THE NORMAL OPERATION IT MAY BE OBJECTED THAT QUANTITY OF MONEY IS NOT THE ONLY FACTOR INFLUENCING THE RISE AND FALL OF PRICES BUT THAT INFLATION AND COLLAPSE OF CREDIT HAVE THE SAME EFFECT THIS IS UNDOUBTEDLY TRUE BUT CREDIT DEPENDS LARGELY ON THE PROSPECTS OF THE MONEYSUPPLY THE KNOWLEDGE THAT A COMMISSION OF EXPERTS IS READY TO CONTRACT THE CURRENCY WILL PREVENT UNDUE AND OVERINFLATED CREDITS AND THE KNOWLEDGE OF POWER TO EXPAND THE CURRENCY WILL GIVE INFINITE CONFIDENCE AND POWER OF RESISTANCE IN TIMES OF PANIC AND DEPRESSION THE POSSIBLE OBJECTION THAT THE STOCK OF BULLION IN THE VAULTS OF THE GOVERNMENT MAY BECOME DEPRECIATED AND THE GOVERNMENT MAY LOSE THROUGH CORNERS OR OTHERWISE WHEN IT SELLS BULLION NEED HAVE LITTLE WEIGHT IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE WILL BE MORE BUYING THAN SELLING WHICH WOULD STIFFEN THE PRICE OF SILVER AND SECONDLY THOUGH THE BULLION VALUE SHOULD FALL THE GOVERNMENT WOULD BE AS SAFE AS IT IS AT PRESENT WITH IOOOOOOOO GOLD TO REDEEM 34OOOOOOO GREENBACKS AND SOME 40OOOOOOO OF SILVER CERTIFICATES LET THE UNITED STATES ADOPT THIS PLAN AND WE SHOULD BE INDEPENDENT OF INTERNATIONAL MONETARY CONFERENCES AND BIMETALLIC TREATIES AN INTERNATIONAL MONEY WOULD BE CREATED WHICH THE NATIONS OF EUROPE WOULD SOON BE DRIVEN TO IMITATE INDIANA UNIVERSITY JOHN R COMMONS 30I

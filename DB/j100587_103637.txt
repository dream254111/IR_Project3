J100587,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 16831775,103637,THE REMAINING PART OF THE OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS ON THE SAL CATHARTICUM AMARUM COMMONLY CALLED THE EPSOM SALT BY MR JOHN BROWN CHYMIST F R S,I206897,372 II THE REMAINING PART OF THE OBSERVATIONS AND EX PERIMENTS ON THE SAL CATHARTICUM AMARUM COMMONLY CALLED THE EPSOM SALT BY MR JOHN BROWN CHYMIST F R S N E A R NEWCASTLE THEIR METHOD IS TO RECEIVE THE SEA WATER INTO THEIR RESERVOIRS AT HIGHWATER AT ANY TIME OF THE MOON IF THERE BE NO FRESH IN THE RIVER OCCASIONED BY RAIN IN THE HIGHER COUNTRY AND FROM THESE RESERVOIRS WITHOUT EXPOSING OF IT IN BEDS AS AT LEMINGTON THEY PUMP IT INTO THEIR BOYLING PANS WHERE EVAPORATING IT ALMOST TO A PELLICLE THEY FILL IT UP AGAIN 8 OR 9 TIMES AND THEN WASTE IT WITH A GEN TLE HEAT FOR THE COMMON OR SEA SALT THE LIQUOR THAT RUNS FROM THIS SALT WHEN TAKEN OUT AND PUT INTO PRO PER VESSELS IS WHAT THEY CALL THE BITTERN WHICH IF IT STANDS SOME TIME IN THOSE VESSELS A SALT WILL SHOOT AND CRYSTALIZE TO THE SIDES IN TASTE PRETTY MUCH LIKE SEA SALT BUT WITH A SHARE OF BITTERNESS AND SEEMS TO AN SWER TO THE CATSALT OF THE LEMINGTON WORKS AND VERY PROBABLY WOULD SHOOT AFTER THE SAME MANNER IF THEY MADE USE OF THE SAME APPARATUS I COULD NOT BUT MENTION THIS GENERAL AND LOOSE AC COUNT OF MAKING THE COMMON SALT AS NECESSARY TO IN TRODUCE THE LIQUOR CALLD BITTERN WHICH BEFORE DR HOY FOUND OUT AN USE FOR IT WAS ALWAYS FLUNG AWAY BEING SO DIFFERENT IN ITS PROPERTIES FROM THE BRINE MADE USE OF TO PRODUCE THE SEA SALT THAT IT WOULD NOT BOIL UP INTO A SEA SALT AGAIN AND REQUIRED THE NICEST SKILL AND ATTENDANCE OF THE OPERATOR TO DETERMINE THE TIME WHEN TO TAKE OUT THE SEA SALT FROM THE PANS BEFORE373 BEFORE THE BITTERN INCORPORATED WITH IT WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE SPOIL THE WHOLE MAKING THE BITTERN AT LEMINGTON AS OBSERVD BEFORE NOT SHOOTING TO THE STICKS IS CARRYD BY CHANNELS INTO PITS MADE TIGHT WITH CLAY WHERE IT STANDS FOR SOME MONTHS AND THERE WILL SHOOT AGAIN WHAT LIQUOR REMAINS IS BOYLD DOWN TILL SUCH TIME AS IT IS OBSERVED TO BE IN A DISPOSITION TO CRYSTALIZE AND THEN IS CONVEYD INTO WOODEN COOLERS LINED WITH LEAD THE LIQUOR WHICH WILL NOT SHOOT THERE IS BOYLD DOWN AFTER THE SAME MANNER IN ORDER FOR ANOTHER CRYSTALIZATION BY THIS TIME THE LIQUOR SEEMS TO HAVE ALTERD ITS PROPERTY AND BECOMES OF A VERY PUNGENT BITING TASTE AND IF BOYLD DOWN WILL NO LONGER SHOOT INTO CRYSTALS AS BE FORE BUT PRECIPITATES DURING THE BOILING A SMALL GRAIND SALT AND IF YOU FOR EXPERIMENTSAKE SHOULD CONTINUE TO BOIL DOWN THE LIQUOR SEPARATED FROM THIS SALT EACH QUANTITY OF SALT THUS PRODUCED WILL STILL BE MORE PUNGENT THAN THE OTHER IF YOU BOIL DOWN THE WHOLE QUANTITY OF THIS LIQUOR IT WILL PRODUCE A SALT WHICH IF EXPOSD TO THE AIR WILL RUN PER DELIQUIUM BUT AS THIS SALT IS NOT THE BUSINESS OF OUR PRESENT EN QUIRY IT MAY PROBABLY BE THE SUBJECT OF ANOTHER PA PER THE LIQUOR THAT PRODUCES THIS SALT IS ALWAYS FLUNG AWAY WHEREVER THE SAL CATHARTICUM IS MADE THIS IS WHAT AT PRESENT I CAN GIVE NO OTHER NAME TO THAN A THIRD SALT PRODUCD FROM THE SEA WATER DIFFERING IN SOME RESPECTS AS MUCH FROM THE OTHER TWO AS THEY DIFFER FROM ONE ANOTHER TO RETURN TO THE SEVERAL CRYSTALIZATIONS SUCH AS MENTIOND TO BE SHOT FROM THE BITTERN THESE WILL BE OF DIFFERENT SIZES AS TO THEIR FIGURES AND HOLD SOME SHARE OF THE THIRD SALT BUT NOW TAKEN NOTICE OF WHICH MAKES THEM APT TO GIVE AND DISSOLVE NOR IS THEIR TASTE COME YET TO THAT SIMPLE BITTER OF THE PURE SALT THESE THEREFORE ARE EITHER SEPARATELY OR ALTOGETHER TO BE FLUNG N N N 2 INTO374 INTO A COPPER WITH AS MUCH COMMON WATER AS IS SUF FICIENT TO DISSOLVE THEM AND ALLOW OF A GENTLE EVAPO RATION TILL SUCH TIME AS THEY ARE AGAIN READY TO BE POURD INTO THE COOLERS IN ORDER FOR CRYSTALIZATION THIS GENERALLY PROVES TO BE THE PURE SAL CATHARTICUM THROUGHLY FREED AS FAR AS THE EXPERIMENTS I HAVE TRYD CAN BE CONVINCIVE FROM EITHER A SEA SALT OR THE THIRD SALT THE LIQUOR DECANTED FROM THIS SHOOTING MAY BE BOILD DOWN AGAIN IN ORDER FOR A SECOND SHOOTING AND AFTER THAT A THIRD BUT AS THE LIQUORS FROM THESE SHOOTINGS ARE BOYLD AWAY MORE OR LESS SO YOU WILL SOONER OR LATER MEET AGAIN WITH THE PUNGENT LIQUOR WHICH CONTAINS THE THIRD SALT AS YOU DID IN THE FORMER SHOOTINGS FROM THE BITTERN WHICH THE PURE SAL CA THARTICUM IS AS NECESSARILY REQUIRED TO BE FREED FROM AS FROM THE COMMON SALT A PROOF OF WHICH CANNOT BE BETTER DETERMINED THAN BY ONE OF THE EXPERIMENTS TO BE TAKEN NOTICE OF HEREAFTER VIZ THAT WITH THE OL VITRIOL WHICH WILL CERTAINLY FERMENT WITH THIS SALT IF THE SEA SALT HAS NOT BEEN WELL SEPARATED FROM IT OR IF IT STILL HOLDS SOME OF THE THIRD SALT AND WHEN ANY OF THE CRYSTALIZATIONS WILL NOT STAND THE TEST OF THIS EX PERIMENT THEY OUGHT TO BE DISSOLVD AND SHOT AGAIN AS BEFORE BY WHICH MEANS THE PURE SALT IS TO BE OBTAIND I DO NOT MENTION THIS AS A TRYAL MADE USE OF AT THE SALTWORKS BUT WHAT I HAVE BY EXPERIENCE FOUND TO BE TRUE AND THE SAME EXPERIMENT WILL SERVE TO DISTIN GUISH A SAL MIRABILE MADE AT THESE WORKS FROM THAT MADE WITH OL VITRIOLI AND COMMON SALT THE ACCOUNT THEY GIVE OF IT IS THIS THEY TAKE ANY QUANTITY OF COARSER GRAIND CRYSTALS BOYLD FROM THE BITTERN WHICH WHEN DISSOLVD AND EVAPORATED MORE THAN THEY WOULD OTHERWISE DO FOR MAKING THE SAL CATHARTICUM THEY THROW INTO A WOODEN BOWL WITH SOME OIL OF VITRIOL WHERE IT STANDS FOR TEN DAYS AND SHOOTS INTO LARGE CRYSTALS375 CRYSTALS TRANSPARENT AND LIKE THE SAL MIRABILE BUT AS THIS SALT BY THIS METHOD IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY SATIATED WITH THE OL VITRIOL IF THEY USE ANY SO IT IS EASILY DIS COVERED BY THE OL VITRIOL WHICH WILL READILY FERMENT WITH IT WHEREAS IT HAS NO EFFECT ON THE OTHER SAL MI RABILE MADE AS ABOVE BY THE ASSISTANCE OF MY INGENIOUS FRIEND ROBERT CAY ESQ AT NEWCASTLE I HAVE RECEIVED THE SEVERAL SHOOT INGS OF SALTS FROM THEIR BITTERN AS ALSO SOME OF THE BIT TERN IT SELF FROM EACH OF WHICH I HAVE OBTAIND A PURE SAL CATHARTICUM AS ALSO THE LIKE KIND OF THIRD SALT AS MENTIOND FROM THE LEMINGTON BITTERN THE METHOD I TOOK IN DOING IT IS AGREEABLE TO THAT I HAVE ALREADY MENTIOND AND MANY YEARS AGO TRYD AT THE SALTWORKS NEAR PORTSMOUTH IT IS BY MR CAY THAT I AM INFORMD THEY SOMETIMES BOYL THEIR BITTERN WITHOUT LETTING IT STAND ANY TIME TO SHOOT OF ITSELF THE INFERREDDIFFERENCEINFERRED IS NOT VERY MATERIAL IF THIS ACCOUNT BE INTELLIGIBLE WHAT THE SAL CA THARTICUM IS WILL NO LONGER BE A MYSTERY AND THE NEXT THING WORTH THE ENQUIRING INTO WILL BE WHETHER THIS SALT DESERVES THE REFLECTIONS THAT HAVE DISCOURAGED THE PRESCRIPTION OF IT AND WHY IT MAY NOT PASS FOR A SALT AS EXCELLENT IN ITS KIND AND BE OF THE SAME NA TURE AND HAVE THE SAME PROPERTIES AS THAT PRODUCD FROM THE EPSOM OR ANY OTHER BITTER PURGING SPRINGS AND IN ORDER TO PROVE IT TO BE SO I SHALL GIVE A VERY SHORT ABSTRACT OF WHAT DR GREW SAYS OF HIS SALT AND THEN OBSERVE HOW NEARLY THE TWO ACCOUNTS AGREE THE DOCTOR IN HIS TREATISE DE NATURA SALIS CATHARTICI AMARI CHAP 2 SAYS THAT IN THE EVAPORATION OF ANY OF THE BITTER PURGING WATERS THEY YIELD A CREMOR AT TOP AS ALSO A SEDIMENT BOTH TOGETHER WEIGHING 6 8 OR ABOUT 10 DRAMS FROM A GALLON OF WATER AND THAT THE LESSER PART OF THIS SEDIMENT IS IN SUBSTANCE THE376 THE SAME WITH THIS CREMOR THE REST IS ALL SALT BUT CONSISTS OF TWO SORTS ONE A MURIATICK SALT THE OTHER WHICH IS PROPER OR PECULIAR TO THESE WATERS IN THE EPSOM WATER THE MURIATICK SALT IS ABOUT A 20TH PART OF THE SALINE MIXTURE IN THE DULWICH IT IS IN A GREATER PROPORTION AND THE SAME IN SEVERAL OTHERS IT IS BOTH IN ITS ACRIMONIOUS TASTE AND FIGURE OF ITS CRY STALS NOT UNLIKE TO COMMON SALT THE OTHER SALT IS THAT WHICH HE SAYS IS PARTICULAR OR PROPER TO THE PURG ING WATERS AND IS MADE BY EVAPORATION AND CRYSTA LIZATION IN THIS PREPARATION FIRST THE EARTHY OR PLAI STERY PART IS TO BE SEPARATED NEXT THE MURIATICK SALT AND LASTLY A BROWN AND DARK LIQUOR FROM THE PROPER SALT OF THE WATERS AND IN THE 4TH CHAPTER OF THE SAME PART HAVING SHEWN THE DIFFERENCE OF THE FIGURE BETWIXT THE CRY STALS OF THIS SALT AND THOSE OF ALUM HE GOES ON NEI THER IS THERE ANY BETTER GROUND TO ACCOUNT THE PURGING SALT A SPECIES OF COMMON SALT FROM WHICH BEING PER FECTLY FREED IT DIFFERS AS MUCH IN TASTE AS FROM ALUM AND IN THE SAME CHAPTER HE SAYS IT WILL APPEAR THE BITTER PURGING SALT ALTHOUGH IT HATH SOME QUALITIES IN COMMON WITH OTHER SALTS YET IS TRULY OR SPECIFICALLY DIFFERENT FROM THEM ALL THUS FAR DR GREW NOW I CANNOT SEE ANY THING IN THIS ACCOUNT BUT WHAT WILL CONSIDERATIS CONSIDERANDIS VERY WELL AGREE WITH THE PURGING SALT FROM THE SEA WATER FOR FIRST THERE IS AN EARTHY OR PLAISTERY PART CONTAIND IN THESE WATERS AND THIS MUST BE SEPARATED THE VERY SAME IS IN THE SEA WATER AND IS PRECIPITATED IN THE BOILING THEM DOWN AS HAS BEEN OBSERVD AND BY THE OPERATORS IS CALLED SCRATCH NEXT THERE IS A MURIATICK SALT ALLOWD TO BE IN THESE WATERS IN SOME MORE IN SOME LESS AND THIS IS LIKEWISE377 LIKEWISE TO BE SEPARATED THE VERY SAME IS DONE FROM THE SEA WATER THOUGH IN A VASTLY LARGER PROPORTION AND LASTLY THERE IS A BLACK AND DARK LIQUOR TO BE SEPARATED THO THIS IS BUT A DARK WAY WHICH THE DOCTOR MAKES USE OF TO EXPRESS HIMSELF IT CANNOT BE BETTER EXPLAIND THAN BY WHAT HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE FACT IN BOILING DOWN THE WATERS AT SHOOTERSHILL THAT AFTER SEVERAL SHOOTINGS OF SALTS BY REPEATING THE BOILINGS OF THE WATERS THERE WOULD AT LAST REMAIN A LIQUOR OF A DEEP BROWN COLOUR WHICH WOULD NO LONGER YIELD A CRYSTALIZD SALT BUT IF BOILD UP DRY WOULD AFFORD A SALT OF THE SAME KIND WITH THE THIRD SALT ALREADY MEN TIOND AND THIS EXPLAINING DR GREWS BLACK AND DARK LIQUOR HELPS AT THE SAME TIME TO PROVE IN THIS AR TICLE TOO THAT THE SEA WATER AFFORDS THE SAME KIND OF THIRD SALT I HAVE TRYD SEVERAL OF THE EXPERIMENTS MENTIOND BY THE DOCTOR BY WHICH HE DISTINGUISHES HIS SALT FROM OTHER SALTS SUCH AS NOT AFFECTING THE COLOUR OF SYRUP OF VIOLETS CURDLING OF MILK WHEN BOILD IN THE FIGURE OF ITS CRYSTALS IN ITS EASY DISSOLUTION IN THE SAME QUANTITY OF WATER IN ITS COAGULATING WITH THE OL TARTAR PER D L IN ITS CALCINATION AND IN THE BITTER NESS OF ITS TASTE AS WELL BEFORE AS AFTER CALCINATION C AND FIND THIS SALT THUS SEPARATED FROM THE SEA WATER ANSWER TO ALL THE TRYALS SOME FEW EXPERI MENTS THAT THE DOCTOR HAS NOT TAKEN NOTICE OF I SHALL HERE SUBJOIN AND THEN LEAVE THE WHOLE TO THE OPINI ON OF BETTER JUDGES WHETHER THERE BE ANY SPECIFICAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO SALTS IN ORDER TO HAVE A STANDARD FOR THESE EXPERIMENTS I PURPOSELY GOT MY FRIEND MR HYET APOTHECARY AT EPSOM WHOSE FIDELITY I COULD DEPEND ON TO BOIL ME DOWN SOME OF THEIR WATERS WHICH HE DID FROM THE WELL378 WELL IN THE TOWN AND SENT ME A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF THE SALTS TO ANSWER THE PURPOSE I WANTED THEM FOR I PROCURED LIKEWISE SOME OF THE FIRST SALTS FROM THE LEMINGTON BITTERN THESE DO NOT HOLD SO MUCH OF WHAT I HAVE ALREADY DISTINGUISHED BY THE NAME OF THE THIRD SALT AS I FIND THE NEWCASTLE SALTS DO THIS LEMINGTON SALT I FOR DISTINCTION SAKE CALL THE FIRST LEMINGTON SALT PART OF THIS I DISSOLVD AND SHOT INTO PURE SAL CA THARTICUM BEING FREED AS WELL FROM THE SEA SALT AS THE THIRD SALT AND THIS I CALL THE SECOND LEMINGTON SALT I PROCURED LIKEWISE FROM NEWCASTLE THE FIRST SALTS SHOT FROM THEIR BITTERN WHICH I CALL THE FIRST NEWCASTLE SALT PART OF THESE I LIKEWISE DISSOLVD AND SHOT AND OB TAIND A PURE SAL CATHARTICUM AND THIS IS WHAT I CALL THE SECOND NEWCASTLE SALT I AM OBLIGED TO MAKE USE OF THE SAL MIRABILE MADE FROM THE OL VITRIOL AND COMMON SALT THAT HAVING BEEN TAKEN FOR THE SAL CATHARTICUM AS ALSO COMMON SALT THAT HAVING BEEN REPRESENTED AS THE PRINCIPAL SUBSTANCE OF THE SAL CATHARTICUM I TOOK HALF AN OUNCE OF EACH OF THESE SALTS AND DIS SOLVD THEM IN ABOUT TWO OUNCES OF WATER TO EACH HALF OUNCE OF SALT A SMALL QUANTITY OF EACH DISSOLUTION I POURD INTO AS MANY GLASSES AND DROPT INTO THEM ALL SOME BUTYR ANTIMONII THE PRECIPITATION THAT FOLLOWD SEEMD TO BE ALIKE IN THEM ALL AND UPON DROPPING A LITTLE OL VITROL INTO EACH WHAT WAS PRECIPITATED BEING MORE PO WERFULLY ATTRACTED BY THE OIL THE SEVERAL LIQUORS BE CAME CLEAR THESE ARE THE TWO ONLY EXPERIMENTS IN WHICH I FOUND THE CONSEQUENCES SO MUCH ALIKE IN THEM ALL IN379 IN THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENTS THE SAL MIRABILE IS SUFFICIENTLY DISTINGUISHD FROM ALL THE REST SLICES OF GALL CUT INTO THESE SEVERAL SOLUTIONS HAVE NO MANNER OF EFFECT UPON ANY EXCEPT THAT OF THE SAL MIRABILE WHICH IS SOON TINGD OF THE COLOUR OF SACK OR RATHER DEEPER SP SAL ARM C TART DROPT INTO THE SEVERAL SOLUTIONS TURNS THEM ALL MILKY EXCEPT THAT OF THE SAL MIRABILE WHICH KEEPS ITS TRANSPARENCY THE SP SALIS ARMON C CALCE THE OL TART P DELIQ THE TINCTURA COCCINELL IN SP VIN FACT DO EVERY ONE USED AFTER THE SAME MANNER SUFFICIENTLY DISTIN GUISH THE SAL MIRABILE FROM ALL THE REST IN THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENTS THE EPSOM SALT THE SECOND LEMINGTON SALT AND SECOND NEWCASTLE SALT AGREE TOGETHER AND DIFFER FROM THE COMMON SALT THE FIRST LEMINGTON SALT AND FIRST NEWCASTLE SALT IN THE SEVERAL SOLUTIONS I DROPT A SOLUTION OF SILVER IN AQ FORTIS FROM WHICH FOLLOWD THESE CONSEQUENCES THE SOLUTION OF THE EPSOM SALT SECOND LEMINGTON SALT AND SECOND NEWCASTLE SALT BECAME EQUALLY MILKY BE FORE THE PRECIPITATION THE SOLUTION OF THE SEA SALT AND FIRST NEWCASTLE SALT LET THE PRECIPITATION PASS WITHOUT RECEIVING ANY MILKY TINGE THE FIRST LEMING TON SALT AS HOLDING LESS OF THE THIRD SALT THAN THE FIRST NEWCASTLE SALT DID TOOK A LITTLE MILKY TINGE THE PRE PITATION FELL NIMBLY THOROUGH THE SOLUTION OF THE SAL MIRABILE LEAVING IT MILKY IN THE CONDITION THESE WERE IN I POURD SOME OL TARTAR PER DELIQ TO EACH OF THEM ON WHICH AFTER SOME TIME A BLUEISH SCUM AROSE ON THE SURFACES OF THE EPSOM SALT SECOND LEMINGTON SALT AND SECOND NEW CASTLE SALT THERE LIKEWISE APPEARD A LITTLE ON THE FIRST LEMINGTON SALT BUT NOT ANY ON THE REST O O O A SO380 A SOLUTION OF CORROSIVE SUBLIMATE WAS MADE INWATER TEN DROPS OF WHICH MIXED WITH THE SEVERAL SOLUTIONS PRODUCED LITTLE OR NO ALTERATION BUT UPON DROPPING IN THE OL TARTARI PER DELIQ THE FOLLOWING APPEARANCES WERE PRODUCD IN THE SOLUTION OF THE EPSOM SALT SE COND LEMINGTON SALT AND SECOND NEWCASTLE SALT THE PRECIPITATIONS WERE RED IN THE SOLUTION OF THE COM MON SALT AND FIRST NEWCASTLE SALT THE PRECIPITATIONS WERE WHITE IN THE SOLUTION OF THE FIRST LEMINGTON SALT THE PARTICLES PRECIPITATED APPROACHD PRETTY NEAR THE COLOUR OF THE THREE FIRST I TOOK SOME OF THESE SEVERAL SALTS IN SUBSTANCE AND TO EACH OF THEM POURD A LITTLE OL VITRIOL WHICH IS ONE OF THE EXPERIMENTS DR GREW TRYD UPON HIS SALT AND WHICH HE SAYS CAUSES A MODERATE EBULLITION WHEREBY IT APPEARS TO PARTAKE OF AN ALKALINE PRINCIPLE BUT WITHOUT LOOKING FOR THIS ALKALINE PRINCIPLE FROM ITS FER MENTING WITH AN ACID TERMS JUSTLY EXPLODED BY THE LEARNED DR FREIND IN HIS PRAELECTIONES CHYMICAE I AM INCLIND TO BELIEVE THAT THE SALT HE TRYD THE EXPERI MENT ON HAD NOT ACCORDING TO HIS OWN DIRECTIONS BEEN THOROUGHLY SEPARATED FROM HIS MURIATICK SALT FOR THIS OIL POURD ON THE EPSOM SALT SECOND LEMING TON SALT AND SECOND NEWCASTLE SALT PRODUCD NO SENSI BLE FERMENTATION ON THE SEA SALT IT ACTS WITH VIO LENCE FORCING OFF ITS ACID SPIRIT WITH AN INSUFFERABLE GAS THE SAME EFFECT IN PROPORTION IT HAD ON THE FIRST LEMINGTON SALT AND FIRST NEWCASTLE SALT NONE AT ALL ON THE SAL MIRABILE AS BEING A SEA SALT ALREADY SATIA TED WITH THE OIL WHAT I HAVE ALL ALONG CALLD THE THIRD SALTANSWERS IN MOST OF THESE EXPERIMENTS TO THE SEA SALT AND YET HAS SOME PROPERTIES EXCEEDINGLY DIFFERENT FROM IT TO THOSE I HAVE MENTIOND THESE MAY BE ADDED IT WILL NOT DE CREPITATE381 CREPITATE LIKE SEA SALT IT READILY MELTS WHEN PUT IN A CRUCIBLE IN THE FIRE AND WHEN CALCIND TILL REDHOT AFFORDS A CALX EQUAL TO IF NOT STRONGER THAN A LIME STONE AND FERMENTS VIOLENTLY AS WELL WITH WATER AS WITH OL VITRIOL THIS CALXWHEN EXPOSD TO A MOIST AIR WILL PART OF IT RUN PER DELIQ BUT NOT SO SOON AS BEFORE CALCINATION ALL THESE PROPERTIES DIFFER IN EVERY RE SPECT FROM THE COMMON SALT AND LEAVE ME STILL IN DOUBT WHAT TO CALL IT AS ALSO HOW FAR EXPERIMENTS OF THIS KIND MAY BE DEEMD CONCLUSIVE O O O 2 III A LET

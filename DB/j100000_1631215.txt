the present cone The map shown in connection with the paper was prepared by M Leon Leboucher for the Club des Montagnards of Guadeloupe This club has recently celebrated the first anniversary of its founding and its report shows that it has done a great deal in a short time toward the opening up of roads and paths to the Soufriere making the highest and one of the most interesting mountains of the Lesser Antilles readily accessible to visitors EDMUND OTIS XOVEY Secretary DISCUSSION AYD CORRESPONDENCE THE BIETRIC SYSTEM TO THE EDITOR OF SCIENCE Permit me to qdiffer from Mr William Kent as to the con clusion to be drawn from Professor W Le Conte Stevenss article on the metric sys tem If he will substitute for the word  im possibility the word possibility I shall be glad to agree that Professor Stevenss  article is useful however in showing the possibility of the general adoption of the metric sys tem in its present form by the people of this country There seems to be every probability that one will not have to live to be very old in order to see by experience this possibility become a fact in this country as well as in Fngland which now seems likely to precede us in this reform as she has in various polit ical ones I can not share the desire of Pro fessors Lane and Stevens to temper the metric system to the conservatism of the American people by adopting its values disguised in the sheeps clothing of the present nonsystem I believe that the intelligence of our people  is not insufEcient to enable them to drink their milk by the liter with as much gusto as by the quart and to realize that six cents a liter is six dollars a hectoliter even if a Greek prefis is involved It takes a bold man to assert that the American people can not do what the French and Germans have done and that thegF will not be able to see the advantage of it If  the people can not be compelled to adopt a nomenclature that is thrust upon them as a substitute for that to which they have always been accustomed we should have no decimal system of currency today for the people were very much accustomed to pounds shillings and pence but seem to have been willing to be compelled to adopt dollars and cents what an outrageous foreign difficult Latin word  and in fact seem even to prefer them Is the inch more sacred than the pound The en gineer will reply yes and here we come to the kernel of the whole matter It is the mechan ical engineers and builders of machine tools who are delaying the adoption of the metric system Now while these persons constitute a very important palt of the community they do not constitute the whole of it Drills taps and dies rigs and jigs are not the only argu ment that should be brought into the question although engineers would have us believe it 0f course it will cost us something to change our system and this is a visible item It is costing us more not to change it but this is not so visible I do not care to go into the arguments here but merely to protest against the argument from conservatism and also to suggest that the best way to find out the facts about the metric system is to apply not to the engineers who have not used it but to the scientific men who have used it The attitude of the conservative engineer toward changing the system of measurement is very similar to that of Csesar toward the Senate  Can not is false and that I dare not falser I wtll not  change ARTHUR GORDON WEBSTER ZOOLOGY AND THE INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUE OF SCIENTIFIa LITERATURE This work has just come into my hands and I have examined it for references on the sub ject to which most of my attention is given via Caelenterata The data given below will indicate the value of the cataloglle so far as Celenterata are concerned in comparison with

that the  International Catalogue contains less than half the refer ences on this subject and that two other far superior bibliographies are being published  It is scarcely necessary to cite specific omis siolls Works of importance published in practically every country are left out Eng land Canada Australia the United States Russia Germany etc If other zoological subjects can be judged by the

the list of titles of the Zoological Record tThe additions made in 1902 are not included in calculating this percentage animals should be taught to take care of them selves by their parents or at least that they shall learn by example AVhile glancing over some of the controversial articles on the sub ject that have lately appeared some cases that bear directly on the question came up to memory There are a few  annual  fishes whose entire cycle of life is performed within a year Pro fessor Robert Collett of Christiania in 18Y8 recorded the biographies of a couple of those which are quite common in Europe They belong to the family of gobies or gobiids and are the Aphya pelluctda and Crystallogobtus 7   ntlssontz Although very distinct in their generic as well as specific characters they agree in their physiological characteristics From June to August they are at the height of their sexual maturity and males are trenchantly differ entiated from females After spawning they  seem always to keep together in enormously large shoals  and are the easy victims of innumerable other fishes large and small Before winter supervenes they are supposed to have all died off   it is probable that no speci men lives more tllan one year and after the close of the breedingtime reveryone dies without living through another spawning con sequently these fishes are really annual ver tebrates The species as represented by adults become extinct annually and are only repre sented by eggs Where then are the teachers or exemplars  A more amiliar group of fishes furnishes us with an analogous case of death after spawning though perhaps less striking than that of the annual gobiids that group is the genus Oncorhynchas including the hook nosed salmons of the west coast All the American species five in number have their alimentary canal so shrunken and defunc tionalized soon after their entrance into fresh water that they can not assimilate food and besides they literally become worn out and used up so that soon after spawning and milt ing they die not one lives to go to salt water and return to fresh again Consequently the  young can not have the benefit either of parental instruction or of learning through

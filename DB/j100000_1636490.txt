of the estate of the late Pro fessor Simon Newcomb Mrs Anita Newcomb McGee 1620 P Street Washington D C offers for sale his complete library of books and pamphlets on astronomy mathematics and allied subjects During the working years of his life it had been his policy to possess for himself so far as circumstances allowed the books necessary in his work As years passed on it seemed to him that the collection would prove to be of permanent scientific value and he therefore enlarged it by the addition of books which he did not need at the time but which he deemed most useful to the future investigator especially the student of scien tific history It had been his hope that his library would help in the training of some future great scientist or in his work This being his motive he was especially anxious that the library should not be divided but should belong to some institution in which astronomical and kindred branches of research are carried on With this end in view the value of the li brary is estimated at only 7000 which is the estimated cost of the purchased books alone although the number of transactions of socie ties and other gift books together with the many thousand pamphlets form a very consid erable portion of the value of the library There are nearly 4000 volumes and about 4000 pamphlets in the library the pamphlets are all classified and arranged for easy refer ence and include reprints of memoirs of as tronomy mathematics and physics In round numbers 1000 volumes are complete sets of publications of learned societies and observa tories There is a complete set of Crelles journal There are 75100 catalogues of precision star places The library is especially rich in all branches of astronomy including popular works history of astronomy ancient astron omy mathematical astronomy astrophysics stellar astronomy and photographic astron omy The large number of volumes on celes tial mechanics including the works of the most celebrated writers is worthy of special mention The bulk of the library is of course on astronomy and mathematics the former predominating but there are also several hun dred volumes on physics geography and meteorology and many of the transactions cover general science It is believed that this is the most complete library of its kind in America except perhaps that at Harvard University and including the Harvard Ob servatory library In addition to the above and not as yet cata logued are several hundredpossibly ap proaching 1000books reports and volumes of periodicals on economic subjects This is also for sale with or apart from the above A typewritten catalogue of this library has been prepared under Professor Newcombs personal direction in which the works are classified approximately on the system now current in catalogues of astronomical litera ture This will be sent to any one contem plating purchase of the collections as a whole Until about the middle of September the library will remain in place and may be ex amined SCIENTIFIC NOTES AND NEWS PROFESSOR SAMUEL WILLIAM JOHNSON emer itus professor of agricultural chemistry in Yale University where he has held a pro fessorship for fiftythree

9100000 The south it will be seen has still much of the virgin forest of the country This forest must be used of course in order to meet the steadily expanding wants of this section It must be used in such a manner however that the very most may be made from its annual cut while at the same time this cut is being replaced by new growth In this way its tim ber will remain a source of perpetual wealth The importance of forest conservation to southern interests is clearly understood by the people of the south The future of the south is more nearly bound up in the plan of forest preservation with its accompanying protec tion to watersheds powerstreams and wood working industries than is anything now be fore the people of this part of the country Not only is the protection of the watersheds which will some day furnish the power to run all manufacturing establishments in the entire south an important matter to the south but the industries depending upon the forest prod ucts will also be benefited by the protection thrown about the remaining timbered area The Globe and Commercial Advertiser New York City contained recently a truly remark able article by Mr E F Naulty the

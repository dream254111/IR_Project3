Effect of the presence of Metals and Metalloids upon the Electric Conducting Power of Pure Copper By A MATTHIESSEN PhD and M HOLZMANN PhD Communicated by Professor WHEATSTONE FBS Received March 14Read April 26 1860 As the electric conducting power of copper varies so much according to different experi menters we thought it would be of some interest to study the causes of these differences and on comparing the values found for copper we find that taking silver 100 copper conducts according to BECQITEREL RIESS LENZ4 DAVY CHRISTIE HARRIS BuTFF POUILLET ARNDTSEN 953 672 734 912 660 1000 954 730 987 The temperatures at which the above observations were made are only given in the cases of BECQUEREL LENZ and ARNDTSEN who compared copper at 0 C with silver at 0 C 100 We prepared therefore pure copper 1 By precipitating with sulphuretted hydrogen the purest commercial sulphate of copper dissolved in water acidulated with sulphuric acid dissolving the washed sulphide in nitric acid precipitating at a boiling temperature by carbonate of soda in excess and finally reducing the oxide of copper with pure hydrogen 2 By precipitating sulphate of copper galvanoplastically by a very weak current We have also tested the galvanoplastic copper of commerce and have found that its conducting power is the same as that of the copper we prepared The method used for the determinations was the same as that described in the Philo sophical Magazine February 1857 The diameters of the wires used were about 025 to 05 millim and the lengths from 05 to 15 metre and of each specimen of copper or alloy two or three determinations were made with wires of different diameters The following are the results obtained with pure copper compared with a hard drawn silver wire 100 at 0 C all the wires were hard drawn MelTnrIs I Copper purified by the above method 1     93236 9 9336 a 9381 II Copper galvanoplastic not fused    9356 Ic 9300  Ann de Chim et de Phys Ser 3 vol xvii p 242 t POGGENDOREEs

experiments with hard drawn wires from copper No 2 and which were annealed in a current of pure hydrogen we found the following numbers I Hard drawn  9531 at 10 Annealed      9783 at 110 II Hard drawn     9572 at 110 Annealed  9802 at 110 which makes a difference in the conducting powers of hard drawn and annealed wires of about 25 per cent much greater however is the difference between hard drawn and annealed silver wires as the following experiments show 0 I a Hard drawn    9528 at 146 b Annealed  10398 at 148 II a Hard drawn    9536 at 146 b Annealed  10333 at 146 We will now proceed to describe what is the effect of the metalloids and afterwards of the metals on the conducting power of copper 1 Effect of Oxygen Suboxide of Copper Copper readily absorbs oxygen from the air when in a fused state and it is supposed to be present as suboxide which it retains very obstinately and in fact we may lead hydrogen over fused copper in a porcelain tube for hours without completely reducing the suboxide It is also very difficult to prevent the oxygen being absorbed during casting c In order to prevent all these sources of error we thought that in making the alloys of copper by the following method we might obviate them Fig I shows the disposition of the apparatus In the furnacedoor communicating with a closed muffle are two holes through the upper one passes a glass tube connected  Ann de Chim et de Phys lvi p 371 86ELECTRIC CONDUCTING POWER OF PURE COPPER AND ITS ALLOYS with a carbonic acid gas apparatus through the lower one passes a clay tobaccopipe to the stem of which is joined the bottle evolving hydrogen The hydrogen is washed with Fig 1 potash nitrate of silver and concentrated sulphuric acid and the carbonic acid gas with bicarbonate of potash and strong sulphuric acid The metal about 8 grms were taken for each experiment was placed in the bowl of the pipe and so fused in a current of hydrogen when fused the hydrogen bubbled up through the melted metal thus by offering a fresh surface to the hydrogen any suboxide that might be present was reduced and when making the copper alloys complete mixture was effected When the hydro gen had passed through for a certain length of time the indiarubber tubing was dis connected from the sulphuric acid bottle and the fused Fig 2 metal carefully sucked into the pipestem forming as shown by fig 2 a wire which might if necessary be drawn finer The carbonic acid gas was used to help    to drive the air out of the muffle as well as in some experiments which will be pre sently detailed In order to test the method copper No 3 was fused in the pipe and kept so for about half an hour when we found the conducting power o Mean a 9257 at 17892 99 at 1705 b 9340 at 172J In this manner we have been able to reduce the suboxide in the copper by degrees all the alloys made were fused in this manner only substituting carbonic acid gas in cases in which hydrogen could not be employed We did not try to determine quantitatively the amount of suboxide present in the copper as we know of no method which will give results which can be depended upon We shall only give the conducting power of copper that had been fused in contact with  DICK Phil Mag June 1858 could not obtain any good results by any of the known methods All the experiments which we have made agree with his especially concerning the action of ammonia on copper N2 87DR A MATTHIESSEN AND DR M HOLZMANN ON THE air Thus copper chemically purified was fused with borax and chloride of sodium the flux not quite covering the surface of the melted copper The conducting power of this specimen was a 6944 at 2421en I b 6938 at 235 6937 at 239 c 6930 at 240 This was then kept fused for several hours in a porcelain tube in a current of

determinations as to the amount of oxygen present in copper have as yet been obtained 88ELECTRIC CONDUCTING POWER OF PIURE COPPER AND ITS ALLOYS 2 Effect of Carbon According to KARSTEN copper takes up 02 per cent of carbon we could not how ever obtain wires containing more than 005 per cent This small quantity causes the conducting power to decrease considerably Thus galvanoplastic copper in small pieces was fused down with lampblack and gave upon analysis 0 05 per cent of carbont and for the conducting power we found o Mean 7429 at 18 4 7553 at 180 7491 at 183 7553 at 185 3 Effect of Phosphorus Phosphorus alters the properties of copper to a very great extent it becomes very much harder and its tenacity is greatly impaired Of all the impurities this has the greatest reducing effect on the conducting power of copper Red phosphorus was thrown on melted copper in a tobaccopipe and refused The amount of phosphorus was determined as phosphate of magnesia o Means Fa 737 at 170

4667 at 200 66 at 20 4 Effect of Sulphur Selenium and Tellurium Sulphide of copper does not appear to dissolve in copper but merely to mix with it mechanically It makes the copper very brittle and although we succeeded in draw ing a wire which contained according to the analysis 0418 per cent of sulphur the values obtained for the conducting power did not agree at all with each other The mean of four determinations gave 8858 at 194 Traces of selenium and tellurium make copper so rotten that we were unable to draw it 5 Effect of Arsenic When arsenic is thrown upon melted copper the greater part of it is absorbed whilst a part volatilizes and on refusing the alloy formed if a large quantity of arsenic has been used it has a dingy grey colour and is very hard and brittle We managed to draw an alloy containing 540 per cent of arsenic to the diameter of 029 millim and  SdnWEieGERs Journal fiir Chemie u Physik lxvi p 395 t We repeated this experiment several times but could not again make the alloy In all probabilitvy therefore the carbon found was only mechanically mixed with copper 89DR A MATTHIESSEN AND DR M HOLZMANN ON THE had we had drawplates with finer holes at our disposal we might have drawn it much finera fact which does not at all agree with the assertions lately made that copper with a small amount of arsenic cannot be drawn into fine wire The arsenic was deter mined as arseniate of magnesia The following values show that arsenic greatly reduces the conducting power of copper I Copper with 540 per cent of arsenic II Copper with 280 per cent of arsenic III

in a current of Ammonia Several experimenters state that when copper is heated in ammonia the gas is decom posed and nitride of copper formed a fact which SCHROTTER disputes and has been proved totally incorrect by DICK We repeated the experiment by heating a copper wire whose conducting power had been previously determined for a quarter of an hour in a current of dry ammonia when cold the conducting power was found the same and the wire was as ductile as before In all probability the reason why in the experiments of previous observers the copper became brittle was as already suggested by DICK that they used copper containing suboxide 7 Effect of the Metals The electric conductivity of copper is not so much impaired by the presence of small quantities of foreign metals as by that of the metalloids it is however very considerably diminished by iron and tin The union of the copper with the other metals was effected in the manner before described which offers in this case the additional advantage that by the constant move ment caused by the hydrogen in the melted metals the most intimate combination results The amount of the metals thus alloyed with the copper was determined by analysis o Means I Coppert alloyed with 320 per cent of zinc  5701 at l 65698 at 103  5701 at 106 II Copper with 160 per cent of zinc  a 7625 at 152 7635 at 158 Lb 7645 at 164J III

all appearance perfectly rotten in GMELINS  Chemistry it is also stated that copper which contains even 01 per cent of lead cannot either be drawn into fine wire or rolled into thin sheets Now the copper smelters add a small quantity of lead to their copper to soften and render it more tough The addition of lead is supposed to reduce the suboxide of copper present but according to J NAPIERS  analysis lead was always found present where it had been added and often in quantities equal to the amount which had been put in We have therefore made a few experiments in this direction To copper fused in contact with air 01 per cent of lead or tin was added and the alloy fused in the tobaccopipe in a current of carbonic acid gas I The copper employed conducted  II With addition of III The

possible to deter mine it quantitatively The experiments however tend to prove that on the addition of traces of lead c to copper containing suboxide a relatively purer metal is obtained From the foregoing experiments we may conclude that there is no alloy of copper which conducts electricity better than pure copper and in conclusion in order to be able to compare their results with those of others we would call the attention of experi menters IT To the importance of stating whether the wires experimented with are hard drawn or annealed as it makes in some cases a very marked difference in the values obtained II To the influence of temperature on the conducting power We find in very few cases the temperature stated at which the observations have been made

ALLEGE THAT BEFORE BRINGING SUIT PLAIN TIFF GAVE THE NOTICE REQUIRED BY THE STATUTE UNDER WHICH THE ACTION WAS BROUGHT WILLIAMS V SMITH N C 46 S E 502 PER CONNOR J  NEITHER OUR OWN NOR THE RESEARCHES OF THE LEARNED AND DILIGENT COUNSEL HAVE ENABLED US TO DISCOVER ANY CASE IN WHICH THIS OR ANY SIMILAR STATUTE IS CONSTRUED IN REGARD TO AN ACTION FOR LIBEL WE ARE COMPELLED THEREFORE TO RESORT TO AN EXAMINATION OF THE QUESTION UPON GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND THE CONSTRUCTION PUT UPON STATUTES RELATING TO OTHER ACTIONS IN WHICH THE SAME OR SIMILAR PROVISIONS ARE FOUND UNDER THE RULE BOTH OF THE COMMON LAW AND UNDER THE CODES WHEN THE STATUTE GIVES A NEW REMEDY AND PRESCRIBES CONDITIONS OR IF AN ACTION OF A CERTAIN CLASS OR AGAINST CERTAIN PARTIES BE AUTHORIZED ONLY AFTER THE PERFORMANCE OF SIMILAR CONDITIONS THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE CONDITIONS WHETHER THE RIGHT OF ACTION EXISTS AT COMMON LAW OR IS CREATED BY STATUTE MUST BE ALLEGED IN THE COMPLAINT AND PROVED AT THE TRIAL 4TH ENC P1  PRAC 655 THE PRINCIPLE IS CLEARLY STATED AND WELL ILLUSTRATED IN REINING V BUFFALO 102 N Y 308 6 N E 792 THE LEGISLATURE OF NEW YORK ENACTED THAT NO ACTION TO RECOVER OR EN FORCE ANY CLAIM AGAINST THE CITY SHALL BE BROUGHT UNTIL THE EXPIRATION OF FORTY DAYS AFTER THE CLAIM SHALL HAVE BEEN PRESENTED ETC RUGER C J SAID THE INQUIRY IS WHETHER THIS PROVISION WAS INTENDED AS A CONDITION PRECEDENT TO THE COMMENCEMENT OF AN ACTION OR SIMPLY TO FURNISH A DEFENSE TO THE CITY IN CASE OF AN OMISSION TO MAKE SUCH DEMAND WE THINK THE PLAIN LANGUAGE OF THE STATUTE EXCLUDES ANY DOUBT ON THE SUBJECT IT ABSOLUTELY FORBIDS THE PROSECUTION OF ANV ACTION UNTIL THE PROPER DEMAND HAS BEEN MADE IT ATTACHES TO ALL AC TIONS WHATSOEVER AND BY FORCE OF THE STATUTE BECOMES AN ESSENITIAL PART OF THE CAUSE OF ACTION TO BE ALLEGED AND PROVED AS ANY OTHER MATERIAL FACT IT DOES NOT PURPORT TO GIVE THE CITY A DEFENSE DEPENDENT UPON AN ELECTION TO USE IT BUT EXPRESSLY FORBIDS THE INSTITUTION OF ANY SUIT UNTIL THE PRELIMINARY REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN COMPLIED WITH    IT IS COMPETENT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ATTACH A CONDITION TO THE MAINTENANCE OF A COMMONLAW ACTION AS WELL AS ONE CREATED BY STATUTE AND WHEN THIS IS DONE ITS AVERMENT AND PROOF CANNOT SAFELY BE OMITTED  THIS COURT HAS GIVEN TO A SIMILAR STATUTE THE SAME CONSTRUCTION SECTION 757 OF THE CODE PROVIDES THAT NO PERSON SHALL SUE ANY CITY COUNTY OR OTHER MUNICI PAL CORPORATION FOR ANY DEBT OR DEMAND WHATSOEVER UNLESS THE CLAIMANT SHALL HAVE MADE A DEMAND UPON THE PROPER MUNICIPAL AUTHORITIES THE SECTION EX PRESSLY REQUIRES THE DEMAND TO BE ALLEGED IN THE COMPLAINT THIS COURT HAS UNIFORMLY HELD THAT A FAILURE TO ALLEGE THE DEMAND MAY BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY DEMURRER LOVE V COMMISSIONERS 64 N C 706 BYNUM J IN JONES V COM82 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER MAY MISSIONERS 73 N C 182 SAYS THAT A DEMAND WAS NECESSARY BEFORE ACTION BE GUN IS WELL SETTLED IF THEREFORE IT HAD APPEARED FROM THE COMPLAINT THAT NO DEMAND HAD BEEN MADE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN GOOD CAUSE OF DEMURRER SCHOOL DIRECTORS V GREENVIUE 130 N C 87 40 S E 847 IN LVICHOL V LVICHOLS 128 N C 108 38 S E 296 IT IS HELD THAT THE PROVISION IN THE STATUTE CODE SEC 1287 THAT IN AN ACTION FOR DIVORCE THE COMPLAINT SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY AN AFFI DAVIT SETTING FORTH THAT THE FACTS RELIED UPON AS GROUND FOR DIVORCE HAD EXISTED TO PLAINTIFFS KNOWLEDGE SIX MONTHS WAS MANDATORY AND THAT FILING SUCH AFFI DAVIT WAS ESSENTIAL TO GIVE THE COURT JURISDICTION OF THE ACTION HOPKINS V HOP KINS 132 N C 22 43 S E 508 THIS IS DIRECTLY IN POINT AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE RULE LAID DOWN IN SAVINGS BANK V POWHATAN CLAY MANUFACTURING COMPANY VA 9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER 898 WE SHOULD BE REMISS IN NOT CALLING ATTENTION IN THIS CONNECTION TO THE CASE OF WALDEN V JAMESTOWN CT APP N Y APRIL 8 1904 31 N Y LAW JOUR NAL 243 HOLDING THAT A CITY CHARTER PROVISION THAT IN AN ACTIOII AGAINST THE CITY FOR PERSONAL INJURIES FROM DEFECTIVE STREETS THE PLAINTIFF MUST SHOW IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE ACTION THAT NOTICE IN WRITING OF THE PLACE OF ACCIDENT WAS GIVEN TO THE MAYOR OR OTHER OFFICER NAMED WITHIN FORTYEIGHT HOURS AFTER ITS HAPPENING IS STIBSTANTIALLY COMPLIED WITH WHEN THE NOTICE IS GIVEN THREE DAYS THEREAFTER WHERE IN THE MEANTIME THE PLAINTIFF WAS IN SUCH CONDITION FROM THE INJURY AS TO BE UNABLE TO TRANSACT BUSINESS A SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE STATUTE IS SUFFICIENT COUNSEL FOR PLAINTIFF URGED THAT THE EXCEEDINGLY BRIEF TIME ALLOWED FOR THE SERVICE OF THE PRELIMINARY NOTICE IS NOT ONLY UNREASONABLE AND SHOCKING TO THLE SENSE OF JUSTICE BUT UNCONSTITUTIONAL AS DEPRIVING THE PLAINTIFF OF PROPERTY WITH OUT DUE PROCESS OF LAW THE COURT DECLINED TO PASS UPON THIS QUESTION BEING OF OPINION THAT THERE WAS A  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE WITH THE STATUTE IT SOUGHT TO JUSTIFY ITS ACTION BY DECISIONS WHICH IT CITCD ALL WITH ONE EXCEPTION BEING ITS OWN BUT WE THINK THAT IT STEPPED UPON DANGEROUS GROUND NECESSITATING THE OPENING OF THE DOOR TO INNUMERABLE QUESTIONS OF A LIKE KIND IF THE COURTS CAN EXTEND A MAXIMUM TIME PRESCRIBED BY THE LEGISLATURE FOR THE DOING OF ONE ACT THEY CAN BE LOGICALLY INVOKED TO GRANT THE SAME LEAVE IN AN INDEFINITE NUMBER OF OTHER CASES IF SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE ALONE BE THE CRITERION THUS IN THE CASE OF THE THIRTY DAYS WITHIN WHICH TO FILE A BILL OF EXCEPTIONSTHE FIFTEEN DAYS WITHIN WHICH A PETITION FOR A REHEARING MAY BE FILED THE THOUSAND LIMITA TIONS IN PROCEDURE WITH WHICH THE NEW YORK CODE ABOUNDS OR TO BROADEN THE ILLUSTRATION ANY STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS THE PRINCIPLE MUST BE THE SAME WHY SHOULD NOT A VIRGINIA PLAINTIFF BE ALLOWED TO INSTITUTE HIS ACTION FOR DAMAGES FOR PERSONAL INJURIES WITHIN 366 DAYS AFTER THE TORT COMMITTED AS HE IS WITHIN 364  IT IS NO ANSWER TO SAY THAT IT IS BECAUSE THE STATUTE DESIGNATES THE TIME AS ONE YEAR FOR UNDER THE NEW YORK VIEW THAT REQUIREMENT IS NOT BINDING BUT IS MET BY A SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCEWHATEVER THAT MAY MEANIN EACH CASE THAT MAY ARISE THE DIFFERENCE IS ONLY ONE OF DEGREE AND NOT OF KIND WHERE I8 THE LINE TO BE DRAWN IF ONCE THE DEPARTURE BE MADE IF THE COURT HAD THE RIGHT TO EX TEND THE TIME FROM TWO DAYS TO THREE IT SURELY HAD THE RIGHT TO EXTEND IT TO FOUR FIVE TEN OR MORE ACCORDING TO THE HARDSHIP OF THE CASE THE REFEREE FOUND1904 NOTE8 OF CASES 83 THAT UP TO THE TIME FOR THE PREPARATION AND SERVICE OF THE NOTICE THE PLAINTIFF WAS SUFFERING MUCH PAIN THROUGH AND IN CONSEQUENCE OF HER INJURIES AND WAS IN A CONDITION IN WHICH SHE WAS UNABLE TO TRANSACT BUSINESS BUT IT WAS NOT FOUND THAT SHE WAS UNDER A RECOGNIZED LEGAL DISABILITY RECURRING AGAIN TO THE VIR GINIA STATUTE SUPPOSE THAT SHE HAD BEEN THUS  UNABLE TO TRANSACT BUSINESS FOR A YEAR AFTER THE INJURY WOULD A PLEA OF LIMITATIONS HAVE BEEN OVERRULED WE THINK THAT THE NEW YORK COURT WOULD HAVE DONE BETTER TO MEET THE QUES TION OF THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE STATUTE SQUARELY AND TO HAVE RESOLVED IT IN THE NEGATIVE FOR AS WAS URGED BY COUNSEL THE REQUIREMENT OF NOTICE WITHIN FORTYEIGHT HOURS WAS PRACTICALLY THE ABROGATION OF THE REMEDYAND THE CONSE QUENT REDUCTION OF THE RIGHT TO NIL NOR IS THE QUESTION TO BE CONFINED WITHIN THE LIMITS ABOVE SUGGESTED IF THE COURTS ARE TO RECOGNIZE AND APPROVE SUBSTAN TIAL COMPLIANCE WITH ONE STATUTE AS EQUIVALENT TO TECHNICAL COMPLIANCE WHY NOT WITH ANOTHER IF THE PRINCIPLE BE SOUND AS TO THE STATUTES OF LIMITATION WHY SHOULD IT NOT APPLY TO STATUTES OF ANY KIND CONTAINING APPARENTLY MANDATORY PROVISIONS  IT SEEMS TO US THAT THE COURT TOOK THE WRONG FORK OF THE ROAD TO A JUST DECISION

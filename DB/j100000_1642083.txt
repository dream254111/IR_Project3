ARNOLD AND HANNIBAL IN  The Marine Tertiary Stratigraphy of the North Pacific Coast  by Ralph Arnold and Harold Hannibal page 6041 is this paragraph A B Reagan 1908 Some Notes on the Olympic Peninsula Most of the geological data in this paper are adopted from one by the senior writer Arnold mentioned  The description of the Quillayute formation is based on the glacial filling of the valley of the Quillayute River If Reagan had visited the locality from which the fossils described from the Quillayute formation were brought by Indians he would have found it to be about two miles from Devils Club Swamp where he says they occur and the formation litho logically very different from what he describes It is typical Empire formation Mr Arnolds article that he says my work was adopted from is  Geological Reconnais sance of the Coast of the Olympic Peninsula Washington2 totalling 18 pages my cited article  Some Notes on the Olympic Penin sula covers 108 pages besides plates I visited the region and collected the fossils described myself with the exception of the fossil Ranella marshalli which was given me by Mr Marshall as is stated in the article I made a good many trips to the place both with Indians and whites We went both by canoe up the river and also on foot in from Quil layute Prairie James Clark now county com missioner of Clallam County Washington ac companied me on my first trip George Wood rough now of Ilwaco Washington was with 1 Reprint from Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society Volume LII No 212 No vemberDecember 1913 2 Bull Geol Soc America Vol 17 pp 451462 me on another trip On practically all the trips I crossed the Devils Club Swamp from the bend in the river to the bluffs adjacent and north of where Maxfield Creek entered Quillayute River when that river ran against the western bluffs instead of about a half mile eastward as it does now at the old mouth of Maxfield Creeknot a later mouth of that creek No fossils were collected in the Devils Club Swamp the article is very plain on this point that the fossils were collected in the bluffs west of the old mouth of Maxfield Creek that is from near the present mouth north ward along the bluffs I will now quote from page 203 of my cited article Quillayute FormationThis is under the gen eral heading Pliocene on page 202 This formation occupies the valley of the Quillayute River and the country drained by its western trib utaries at least to their respective middle courses   The boundaries of the formation were not de termined In the interior region where exposed along the Bogachiel River it is composed of sand stone and bluish shale the coast exposures are all conglomerates or a coarse gravelly rock resting un conformably upon the older rocks exposed there The base of the formation was not seen conse quently was not ascertained The sandstone series was found to be extremely fossiliferous and in it the fossils are beautifully preserved Fossils were found in two horizonsin the north bank of the Bogachiel River in a bluish gray rock in section 22 township 28 north range 14 west of the Willamette meridian and in the bluff south of the abandoned channel of Maxfield Creek on the south side of the Bogachiel River in sections 28 and 29 of the township and range above But fossils were ob tained only from the latter location as the former was below the surface of the water at the time visited Below is a description of the fossils ob tained Fossils of the Quillayute FormationLower Pliocene exposed in the Vicinity of Quillayute Washington Here follows a twopage comparison of the Quillayuteformation fossils with the fossils of other regions with the final conclusion page 206 that Consequently this the comparison results would seem to place the formation at the bottom 171N S VOL XLIV No 1127 of the Pliocene Following is a description of the fossils Here follow twentytwo pages pages from 205 to 226 describing the fossils of the Quil layute formation I will add that I described no fossils whatever from the glacial deposits or Quaternary deposits of the Olympic Penin sula Furthermore in describing each fossil I gave a notation after it telling where it had been found for example take Yoldia cooperi fossil number 34 described on page 206 of the article The notation following the description is as follows Living Half Moon Bay California Arnold San Diego to Santa Cruz Cooper Pleistocene Ventura San Diego Cal Arnold San Pedro Arnold Cooper Pliocene San Fernando Cooper Portata Val ley California Arnold Pliocene Mouth of Quinaielt River Granville Wash Arnold QuillaSute Wash Reagan Again take number 35 Cardium meekianum Gabb on the same page The notation is This is quite a numerous species of the Pliocene at Quillayute Wash Pliocene Humboldt county California Gabb Quillayute Wash Reagan In correlation the sandstone and bluish shale of the Quillayute formation which I definitely described in my article as composing the formation is typical Empire sandstone and shale ALBERT B REAGAN PRINCIPAL U S INDIAN SCHOOL IGNACIO COLORADO

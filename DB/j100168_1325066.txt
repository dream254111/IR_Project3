to keep a school playground in the condition required by statute As a result a school boy was injured Held that the defendants are liable Ching v Surrey County Council 25 T L R 702 Eng K B D July 5 I909 At common law a municipal corporation is not liable for damage caused by its negligence in the exercise of purely governmental functions See Folk v City of Milwaukee io8 Wis 359 It is well established that the maintenance of schools by local boards as agents of the state is a governmental function Freel v Crawfordsville 142 Ind 27 See Hill v City of Boston 122 Mass 344 Therefore a municipal corporation has been held not liable at common law for injuries to a pupil caused by the defective condition of the school house and grounds Wixon v City of Newport 13 R I 454 Finch v Toledo Board of Education 30 Ohio St 37 The reason sometimes given is that the board is not empowered to expend money raised by taxation to meet such claims Ernst v West Covington 116 Ky 850 The fact that the corporation is performing a public service from which it receives no corporate benefit likens the school system to a vast charity and the public interest would be subverted by the diversion of the public school funds to private claims See Ford v School District of Kendall Borough 12I Pa St 543 Therefore a private action cannot be brought for a breach of a municipal corporations public duty to maintain a school unless such action is expressly or impliedly authorized by statute Cf Gibson v Mayor Aldermen  Burgesses of Preston I870 L R 5 Q B 218 Such authorization does not appear in the statute in the principal case PATENTS  EQUITABLE EXECUTION ON PATENT RIGHTS  The plaintiff ob tained a judgment against the defendant a nonresident who held no tangible property within the jurisdiction Upon failure of legal execution the plaintiff applied for the appointment of a receiver by way of equitable execution to re ceive the profits of three English patents owned by the defendant and within the jurisdiction No present income was being derived from the patents Held that no receiver can be appointed Edwards  Co v Picard 25 T L R 815 Eng Ct App July 30 I909 It has been repeatedly held that a patent right is property though on account of its incorporeal nature not subject to seizure and sale at common law Peter son v Sheriff of San Francisco 115 Cal 211 But equity has power to order its assignment and sale for payment of the patentees judgment debt Gillett v Bate 86 N Y 87 Pacific Bank v Robinson 57 Cal 520 And upon the patentees failure to execute such assignment it is proper for the court to appoint a suitable person as trustee to execute the same Ager v Murray 105 U S 126 The same result is reached by the appointment of a receiver to dispose of the patent for the creditors benefit Blanchard v Cawthorne 4 Sim 566 Petition of Keach 14 R I 571 The principal case limits the subjection of a patent right to equitable execution to those instances where income is being derived there from This seems unsound on principle as well as on authority For it would allow the debtor by leaving his patent unworked to defeat the creditor when a sale or license of the patent might yield enough to pay the judgment debt QUASICONTRACTS  RECOVERY FOR BENEFITS CONFERRED WITHOUT CON TRACT MEASURE OF DAMAGES Acting on what both parties erroneously believed to be a contract the plaintiff made improvements on the defendants land Owing to the defendants lack of business judgment the increased value of the premises was less than the cost of the labor and materials expended Held that the plaintiff can recover the value of the labor and materials Vickery v Ritchie 202 Mass 247 To prevent unjust enrichment a plaintiff can recover on a quantum meruit what he deserves under all the circumstances of the case Negligence or want of skill reduces his damages Ervin v Epps 15 Rich Law S C 223 229 And 150RECENT CASES I 5 I they may entirely bar recovery Farnsworth v Garrard i Campb 38 But lack of benefit to the defendant is not a defense unless due to fault of the plaintiff See Edington v Pickle i Sneed Tenn 122 127 Thus it appears that other important considerations would often be omitted if the amount of the defendants enrichment were used as the sole measure of damages But see Farnsworth v Garrard supra Where the plaintiff is not at fault the great weight of American authority looks rather to the services rendered and the materials furnished than to the benefit received by the defendant Such is the rule if the defendant pre vents performance of the contract Mooney v York Iron Co 82 Mich 263 The same rule applies if work is done on express request Stowe v Buttrick I25 Mass 449 But see Van Deusen v Blum 35 Mass 229 If the contract fails owing to mutual mistake or lack of mutual assent the request is implied Buck v Pond 126 Wis 382 In the principal case the fact that the defendant was en riched less than he might have been was due to his own fault and should not affect the plaintiffs recovery RESTRICTIONS AND RESTRICTIVE AGREEMENTS AS TO USE OF PROPERTY COVENANTORS LIABILITY UPON REENTRY AFTER BREACH OF COVENANT BY LESSEE The defendant on buying an estate covenanted with the vendor for himself and his assigns to erect no other than private residences He then granted a lease taking covenants similar to his own The lessees erected a building in violation of the covenant They then became bankrupt and upon their trustees disclaimer of the lease the defendant reentered The rest of the vendors estate with the benefit of the covenants was thereafter sold to the plaintiff Held that the plaintiff is not entitled to a mandatory decree to compel the removal of the building Powell v Hemsley 1909 2 Ch 252 The principal case seems to misunderstand the true grounds for equitable relief by way of mandatory decree Such relief is granted on the theory that only by specific reparation can equity be done when there has been a breach of such a covenant as would ordinarily allow specific performance Tucker v Howard 128 Mass 361 Specific reparation seems to connote a wrong already done and the decree orders that the wrong be undone AttyGeneral v Algonquin Club 153 Mass 447 And whether the plaintiff has suffered damage is imma terial Lord Manners v Johnson i Ch D 673 See Lloyd v London etc Ry Co 2 DeG J  Sm 568 The relief is granted on the ground that the de fendant has broken his covenant and must not be allowed unjustly to be en riched thereby In equity the burden of such restrictive covenants binds all purchasers with notice Tulk v Moxhay 2 Phillips 774 In the principal case the defendant had notice of the restrictions and of his lessees breach Con sequently when he acquired the latters interest he got no right to retain the benefit of the building wrongly erected See Bird v Hall 30 Mich 374 Gaskin v Balls 13 Ch D 324 The discussion by the court as to whether or not there was a continuing breach seems irrelevant and it is submitted that the refusal of relief merely because the breach was completed before the purchase by the de fendant was erroneous SALES  BREACH OF WARRANTY  BUYERS REMEDIES MUTUALLY EXCLU SIVE  The plaintiff sued for the purchase price of a harvesting machine The defendant filed a counterclaim to recover as having rescinded the contract freight charges paid as part of the purchase price and also consequential damages resulting from breach of warranty The court instructed that in case of a preponderance of evidence in his favor the defendant might recover both items so claimed Held that such an instruction is error Houser  Haines Mfg Co v McKay IoI Pac 894 Wash See NOTES p I4I SALES  CONDITIONAL SALES  RISK OF LosS  The plaintiff sold to the defendant a cash register retaining title thereto as security for the payment of

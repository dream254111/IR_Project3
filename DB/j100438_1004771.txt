j100438,Transactions of the American Philosophical Society,1004771,On Two Species of Sphex Inhabiting Virginia and Pennsylvania and Probably Extending through the United States,i241958, 73 I No XV On ttwo species of Sphex inhabiting Virginta and Pennsylvania and probably extending through the United Statas By R Henry Latrobe Read January 21st 1803 Phiiladelphia January 21st 1803 The two species of Sphex to which this memoir is confi ned are well knoNvn under the names blue wasp mason and dirtdauber Among all the remarkable insects belonging to the order of hymenoptera of Linnxus they appear to be most distinguished by their singular and cruel mode of providing for their young The two species are distinguished from each other in their manner of building and in the form of their bodies but agree exactly in their mode of life in the materials of which they build their cells and the food provided by them for their off spring The first No I Plate I is probably the Sphex coerulea of Linnxus of wlhich the following is the description Coerulea alis fuscis habitat in America septentrionali This sphex is by far the most common of the two species the antennae are pointed and stand up when he is at work His nose is furnished with a strong beak with which he works sideways leaving ridges on his cells which make them appear to be plaited his thorax is thick the abdomen petiolated From the scutum attached to the petiole is extended a strong book which is very serviceable to him in securing his prey His sting is not very painful and soon ceases to be troublesome The wings which Linmiaeus describes as brown play between a beautiful green brown and blue The joints of the feet are yellow tlle whole of the head body and legs are blue7 ON TWO SPECIES OF SPHEX I have however seen some individuals which had yellow spots on the thorax in front of the wings The other sphex No Il Plate I probably the Pennsylva nica of Linnaeus differs from the former in many particulars of form and colour Linnaeuss description runs thus Nigra abdomine petiolato atro alis subviolaceis Habitat in Pennsylvania The specific differences are as follows The head is broad the nose blunt and emarginate his tho rax is longer in proportion the petiole of the abdomen very long the hook is wanting the abdomen conical and elegantly formed The general colour is a dark blue approaching to black btut on the thorax are many yellow spots and the legs thighs and feet are also spotted witlh yellow His antennae are longer than in No I and he carries them less upright and often curlsthem No II Fig 2 is an enlarged view of his head The figures both of the coerulea and Pennsylvanica are ex actly the size of the live insects and an attempt is made to imi tate accurately their manner when aliglhting oni their cells The cells bothi of the S coerulea and Pennsylvanica are built of clay collected in moist places but their appearance and mode of contruction is very different The S coerulea chuses in the open air the south side of a rock or of the trunk of a tree for his structure He then seeks by the side of a stream for his materials He scrapes the clay together with his feet and working it into as large a roundi ball as he can well carry off he begins by plaistering the stone or wood with a thin coat He spreads the clay with hiis head uttering a shrill soumd during hiis work Hle then flies off for aniother lump and by degrees forms the upper ridge of his cell He afterwards adapts a second ridge to the first working alternately on each side frequently gOing iiita the tube thus formed and making it perfectly smooth in the inside In this manner hie compleats a tube of 3 or 4 inches lonig before any attempt is made to carry in provisions for thle young broodM1Caeruala t 2b A 1JO  i 11 W  1fMON TWO SPECIES OF SPHEX 75 In the inside of houses nothing furnishes both these species of sphex with a more convenient situation for their cells than the backs of picture frames for tlhey are fond of building in places which have a very nmoderate degree of light and the back of a picture frame lianging against the wall has also the advantage of furnishing two sides of the cell A hollow moulding of a pannel has also its strong temptations or the internal angle of the frame of a table In the wooden houses of Virginia they occupy all these situations in great numbers I have seen the hollow space in the front of the books in a library occupied by a whole tribe of the sphex coerulea which thereby saved themselves much trouble as they had only to close the space between the edges of the binding The sphex Pennsylvanica diflers exceedingly from the coe rulea in the construction of his cells Iinstead of a series of lonig tubes divided into separate cells the former builds separate horizontal apartments close to each other They are perfectly smooth internally but roughly finished on the outside See No II Fig 3  4 of both these species of cells tlhe figures give an exact representation both as to size and form The food provided by both species for their offspring is however exactly the same namely spiders of every genus and species chiefly however of those who do not fortify them selves by extensive webs There is a common yellow spider which they collect in the greatest numbers I have however observed both the Pennisylvanica and coerulea attack large spiders in the midst of their webs and of the dead bodies of other insects which had fallen victims to them especially in a remarkable instance the sphex flew nimbly at the spidertand stung him He then retired to clean himself from the cobwebs This he did in the malnner of a fly using his hind legs to wipe his wings and his forelegs to his head After several attacks tlle spider at last attempted to escape by letting hiimself down to the floor by a thread He then ran away but his enemy followed him and frequently stinging him attempted to carry him off but the spider was too large and heavy and though the sphex endeavoured to lighten his load by biting off the spiders legs he could not succeed while I observed him which was for at least half an hour76 ON TWO SPECIES OF SPHEX The spiders tlhus collected are not killed life enough seems to be still left to preserve them from putrefaction or drying In all the cells which I have opened they were in a languid state capable of motion but not of crawling along Nothing more cruel than their condition can well be conceiv ed They are closely and indiscriminately packed together waiting to be devoured piecemeal by the young worm for whose support they are destined See No I 4  No II 4 Each of the cells of the sphex Pennsylvanica being sepa rately contrived to enclose a sufficient number of spiders they are separately made But the sphex coerulea having formed a long tube crams into it as many spiders as he judges suffi cient and encloses them together with an egg by a cross partition of cday He then puts a new head to the next cell and having filled it encloses it as the first Thus he proceeds to the amnount sometimes of 4 or 5 cells in one tube The egg appears to be soon hatched after deposition though I found it impossible to ascertain the time between the closing of the cell and the escape of the young sphex No I Fig 3  4 exhibit the exact state in which I found two ranges of cells at Ripponlodge in Virginia The cells were made at the back of a picture frame from which I cut them carefully with a table knife The Igure shows the side next to the frame Fig 3 is an empty tube ready to be di vided into cells Fig 4 a is the last filled cell of the other range It is full of spiders the worm having been just hatch ed and eaten nothing b contains a worm more advaniced which Jhas consumed half his store c containis another in a still greater progress to maturity which has but little provision left Fig 5 exhibits the worm which after consuming all the stock of spiders is prepared to spin its involucrum Fig 6 represents the chrysalis broken The dots exhibit its full size In the first range of the cells No I Fig 2 and in No II Fig 3 are seen the holes by which the young sphex escapes No I Fig 4 shews the inside of two cells carefully sepa rated from the board on which they were builtON TWO SPECIES OF SPHEX 77 As I had always found the number of spiders in each cell unequal but apparently regulated by their size I opened a range of cells of the sphex Pennsylvanica and having weigh ing the contents I found the result as follows See No III The lowest contained 19 spiders and a small worm rains which seemed lately hatched and had eaten nothing See Fig IThe spiders weighed 7 The next contained 17 spiders and one empty skin the worm Fig 2 weighed 4 of a grain the spiders fSF The third contained 19 very small spiders and a few empty skins weighing    The worm Fig 3 weighed    The fourth contained only the empty skins of the spi ders The worm Fig 4 seemed lean and weak he was just beginning to spin I think he must have had a short allowance provided for him or have been sick he weighed    The fifth contained an involucrum in which was a large grub not yet changed to a clhrysalis The involu crum and worm being heavier than the last weigh ed        34 The 6th and 7th cells were open at the point the young sphex having escaped This examination proves that the sphex exercises a nice degree of judgment in the quantity of provision he lays up For the cell No 3 must have contained 22 or 23 spiders and I have often counted only 6 or 7 in one but they were of a large size It also appears that the fullgrown worm weighs about half as much as the food that reared him If it be ftirther necessary to break the line which has for merly been drawn between reason and instinct the economy of the whole class of lhymenoptera and especially of the sphex will contribute towards it I will relate a singular in stance of conduct in which instinct appears to be out of the question In order to examine one of these insects the Pennsylvanica at work I raised a picture frame a little from the wall In doing this I injured several of his cells for the dirt sticking78 ON TWO SPECIES OF SPHEX to the wall was torn off and left holes in them through which the spiders and young worms were visible I kept the frame about an inch from the wall so as to see plainly behind it In a few moments the sphex returned bringing with him a round lump of clay He had just begun a new cell but seeing his fornmer work disturbed he ran rapidly over the cells in apparent doubt what to do At last he put down the clay on the nmtargin of one of the holes and began to spread it with his nose pushing it out before hiim with the action of a hog which is rooting While he did this he made a shrill buzzing noise Having plaistered up the hole very perfectly and neatly he flew away In 4 minutes he returned with another lump of clay He put it downi at once by the nlext hole and stopped it in the same nmanner He repeated this four times and having finished his repairs and satisfied himself by ranging over the cells several times he flew for ano tlher lump with which he procceded to compleat his new cell If reason be exhibited in the modification of conduct to unexpected circumstances this surely was an instance of rea soning The sphex saw the unexpected dilapidation of his work it had happened in his absence the clay he brought was for the new cell seeing however the injury done to his work he thoroughly repaired the old cells instead of building new ones For some insteresting notices concerning tlle insects which are the

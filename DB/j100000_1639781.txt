General Education Board has given 750000 toward an endowment of 1500000 for the medical department of Washington University St Louis to create full time teaching and research departments in medi cine surgery and pediatrics The conditions of the gift provide that all teachers in these departments while free to render any medical or surgical service must not derive therefrom any personal gain Their entire time must be devoted to hospital work to teaching and re search in their several specialties as it is be lieved that medical education in the past has suffered from the fact that the teachers have had to rely on private work for the major por tion of their income The General Education Board has also made conditional grants of 100000 each to Knox College Galesburg Ill and to Washburn College Topeka Kan 172 SCIENCEJANUARY 30 1914 ANNOUNCEMENT was made at a meeting of the Yale Corporation on January 19 that gifts and pledges of 350000 had been obtained for the development of the

DISCUSSION AND CORRESPONDENCE TUBERCULOSIS FOLLOWING TYPHOID FEVER IN SCIENCE for 1908 Professor W T Sedgwick of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology called attention to the remarkable discovery by Reincke of Hamburg and Mills of the United States that when an infected water supply of a community was improved by filtration or otherwise not only did ty phoid fever diminish but other diseases also such as tuberculosis Hazen calculated that for every typhoid death prevented two or three were saved from death by other diseases Sedgwick and MacNutt subsequently pub lished their full paper in the Journal of In feetious Diseases and the former in still another paper in a symposium on  Tubercu losis in Massachusetts 1908 stated that as a rule infected waters increased the death rate from

September Sir William R Kennedy one of the Judges of the High Court of Justice of England made an address on the question To what extent should judicial action by courts of a foreign nation be recognized  The subject is of special interest in this country where every State is in a legal sense a foreign jurisdiction to every other We have indeed the unifying rule of the Constitution which re quires that in each state full faith and credit shall be given to the judicial proceedings of every other but this is sub ject to certain limitations arising out of the very nature of judicial proceedings and with respect to judgments of different states as well as with regard to judgment of different nations the courts must decide what those limita tions should be and the decision of the courts on this question depends on the same principles in the one case as in the other In both cases for example fraud in obtain ing the judgment is regarded as sufficient reason for not giving effect to it in another state or country in both cases the question may be asked whether the court which pro nounced the judgment had jurisdiction of the cause and in both cases it must be determined whether that question should be decided by the court that pronounced the judg ment or by the court that is asked to enforce it Sir William Kennedy considered the subject with especial reference to the status of individuals as affected by divorce or other decrees and the right to represent the person or property of others but he spoke also of the basis of jurisdiction in actions in personam and in speaking on this subject he made some observations which seem to suggest that there is a difference of emphasis at least in the treatment of the subject by the Courts of the United States and those of other countries Seeking to formulate a rule which would express the irreducible minimum of the requirements of a foreign judg ment which the courts of any country should give effect to he saidJURISDICTION O VER NONRESIDENTS  It must appear to the court which is asked to give effect to it that A It has been pronounced by a court of competent jurisdiction B It is final or as continental jurists term it executory in the country in which it is pronounced C It does not decree anything and does not give effect to a claim which itself is contrary to the public policy or law of the country in which it is sought to enforce it Provided always that the tribunal before which the question of en forcement is raised should treat the judgment as invalid if it is shown to have been obtained by fraud All these requirements are insisted upon by the courts of this country in dealing with judgments of different states as well as of foreign countries and the rule as an expression of the irreducible minimum wouldbe approved by our courts but it will be observed that in this rule there is no express statement of the rule laid down by the Supreme Court of the United States in Pennoyer v Neff1 and declared in many other cases by the State as well as the Federal courts in this country that without service of process within the territory no jurisdiction can be ob tained to pronounce a money judgment in an action in personam against a nonresident who does not appear The point was not overlooked it is needless to say by Judge Kennedy He goes on to say  Ought proof also to be required by the court from which enforce ment is sought that the parties were duly cited and if it was a judgment by default that the party against whom it was pronounced had been made aware of the action and had the opportunity of defending himself I have not suggested such a condition because in the first place so far as regards the observance of its own prescribed procedure we might apply I am inclined to think the rule  omnia fresumuntur rite esse acta and not allow the contrary to be alleged except as an element of fraud in the obtain ing of the judgment and in the second place because the only objection on the plea that the prescribed procedure was itself improper or as the point has sometimes been put  inconsistent with natural justice which ought in my humble judgment to be entertained will be found I think really to be objections to the international competence of the tribunal It is beyond controversy that in the absence of an international agreement as to the rules of competence it is right and also consistent with the comity of nations that the court which is asked to give effect to a foreign judgment should satisfy itself that the tribunal which gave the judgment belonged to a country whose sovereignin the language of Mr Dicey Conflict of Laws pp 33 36 39might in accordance with the principles maintained by the court which is asked to enforce the judgment rightly adjudicate upon the matter in which the judgment was given It 1I877 95 U S 714 487COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW is I am afraid equally beyond controversy that the principles which are maintained by courts of law as to international competence of jurisdiction are not everywhere the same He refers to the fact that English and American courts would not regard as internationally competent the forZum actoris given to Frenchmen by Art 14 of the Code Napoleon1 nor accept the claim of the courts of Scotland to ground jurisdiction in an action in personam on the mere possession of property within the territory2 and he says  Nothing except an international convention can create a uniform criterion of the competency of the jurisdiction of the adjudging tribunal Then he goes on to say that assuming that no question of want of jurisdiction can be raised and that the party against whom judgment has passed is found to have been rightly treated as subject to the jurisdiction of the foreign court it seems to be clear that he is bound by the ordinances of the foreign court with respect to citation and procedure and that when sued abroad he should not be allowed to find a defence in the opinion of the Court where he is sued that the pro cedure was not what it should have been There is no recognized natural justice with regard to legal procedure and in dealing with civilized countries we must assume that their rules though not perhaps in accordance with our notions do not constitute a violation of morality and natural justice This statement assumes that jurisdiction may be obtained quite independently of the question of service of process within the territory The argument is that assum ing the defendant is found to have been rightfully treated as subject to the jurisdiction the propriety of the process may be left to the court which rendered the judgment It is clear from this that Sir William Kennedy had in mind that something else than the service of process within the territory might properly serve as the basis of jurisdiction and that he was unwilling to maintain that the service of process within the territory was a necessary test of the international validity of a judgment in an action in personam 1 Schibsby v Westenholz 1870 L R 6 Q B 155 Westlake Priv Int Law p 347 2 Dicey Conf Laws p 380 438JURISDICTION 0 VER NONRESIDENTS It is true that Sir William Kennedy is speaking of what he calls the irreducible minimum of the requirements of judg ments that are to have international validity and that he does not say that some nations do not insist upon other con ditions but it is an interesting and significant fact that he made no reference even in an address made in the United States to the fact that in this country by a long course of decisions in the State and Federal courts the service of process within the territory has been made an essential re quirement of a judgment that is to have recognition beyond the territory of the court by which it is pronounced These decisions in this country have been based not on any local considerations and not alone on the language of the Constitution but on the idea that any other rule would be contrary to the fundamental principles of the law of jurisdiction and against natural justice and that for that reason proceedings which did not conform to this rule would not be due process of law If this doctrine were generally accepted it would follow that in all nations in which it is sought to base jurisdiction upon the principles of natural justice the same rule would prevail and yet Sir William Kennedy speaking from his experience in the English courts and after a careful study of the statutes and decisions of the courts of other countries is unwilling to insist that the service of process within the territory is essential to jurisdiction in actions in personam This brings sharply to our attention the fact that the rule adopted in the United States has not been fully ac cepted in England and on the continent of Europe and that whatever the rule may be with respect to the international competence of judgments it is by no means agreed that a judgment in personam valid within the sovereignty may not be obtained even against a nonresident without service of process within the territory In England the same gen eral principles are accepted with respect to the basis of jurisdiction as in the United States The principles are those of the common law and the rules adopted in the United States are based upon the early decisions of the English courts Both the English and the American courts accept the statement of Judge Story who said in his work on the Conflict of Laws By the common law of England 439COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW and the United States there can be as a general rule no jurisdiction unless it be founded on the fact of either the person or the thing being within the territory but the English courts of recent years have made an important departure from this rule and have refused to apply it when by statutes or by rule of court having the force of statute authority is given to serve notice on nonresidents beyond the seas and so far as regards the effect to be given to the judgment by the English courts at least with respect to British subjects the question of jurisdiction is made to depend upon the rules and statutes rather than upon the general principles on which jurisdiction is founded In countries not governed by the common law there is no general rule that jurisdiction in personal actions is based upon service of process The rule of the Roman Law was actor sequitur forum rei but the forum was either the forum of the origin or of the domicile of the defendant and this rule has been departed from in modern codes Juris diction is based upon nationality or upon the place of the making or of the performance of the obligation In the Code Napoleon the forum actoris is regarded as the proper place for bringing an action and in France today the prin ciple of nationality prevails and the courts are considered as established for the protection of the rights of French men and they are not required to entertain jurisdiction in suits between foreigners A discussion of the principles on which the courts of Continental Europe assume jurisdiction over nonresidents would carry us too far for our present purposes There is some discussion of it in Sir William Kennedys paper and there is a recent article in the Harvard Law Review by A Pillet of the University of Paris2 on jurisdiction in actions between foreigners which shows the difference of the point of view between the French courts and those of England and the United States in considering the jurisdiction over nonresidents He says  Jurisdiction of English courts over personal actions depends on rules quite different from those which governed Roman and still control French law More than that the very spirit of these rules and the manner of their 1 Story Conf of Laws  539 2 i8 Harv Law Rev 325 March 19o5 440JURISDICTION O VER NONRESIDENTS construction belongs to systems very far apart In France as formerly in Rome one asks first if the French courts have jurisdiction the primary question out of the way the law gives the complainant a way of summon ing him In England and in America the process is reversed one seeks first to find out if the writ of summons lassignation can be legally deliv ered to the person wanted personal service or something equivalent done substituted service Then once it is established that the writ can be regularly served the jurisdiction of the court naturally follows In France we should call that putting the cart before the horse M Pillet speaks of the practice of the English and American courts as distinguished from that of the French We can only speak here of the difference between the prac tice of the English courts and that of the American courts under the rule laid down by the Supreme Court of the United States in Pennoyer v Neff In England as well as in the United States the general principle is that the service of the writ or something equivalent thereto is essential as the foundation of the courts jurisdiction in actions in personaml The general rule laid down by Lord Ellenborough in Buchanan v Rucker2 and by Best C J in Douglas v Forrests was asserted by Judge Story in Picquet v Swan4 and in his work on the Conflict of Laws5 and in a recent case quoted by Sir William Kennedy Earle Selborne said6 All jurisdiction is properly territorial and extra territo riumjus dicenti impune nonparetur A court has no juris diction over an absent foreigner even though served with process and formerly resident of the state in which the action is brought The defendant is under no obligation to obey the summons and it may be regarded as a nullity ex cept when authorized by special local legislation in the country of the forum in which it was pronounced It is this exception as we shall see that makes the difference be tween the decisions in this country and those in England Professor Dicey speaking of the English law declares the rule to be that  when the defendant in an action inpersonam is at the time for the service of the writ not in England the court has subject to the exceptions hereafter mentioned no jurisdiction to entertain the action  At common law Dicey Conf Laws 2 808 9 East 192 31828 4 Bingh 686

and in an action in personam this common law doctrine is still subject to definite though wide exceptions maintained He goes on to say however This common law principle has been modified by rules of court made under statutory authority by the judges and in very many actions perhaps numerically in the majority of actions service can be effected on i e the court exerts jurisdiction over a defendant who is out of England It is in this modification of the common law rules that the English law with respect to jurisdiction over nonresi dents in actions in persoznam has become different from that which prevails in this country There are statutes in this country as well as in England providing for service or publication of notice to nonresidents and there are statutes here which expressly authorize personal judgments against nonresidents on service or even publication of notice beyond the limits of the sovereignty by which the court is consti tuted but under the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States such judgments are of no effect for the seizure of property even in the state in which they are pronounced In Pennoyer v Neff2 a local statute provided for notice by publication and for judgment in personam on a money demand against a nonresident defendant who had property in the state and the court had jurisdic tion of the subject of action The Supreme Court held that although the local statute authorized the pro cedure the judgment was of no effect and that property could not be seized or execution issued under it The Court said that although property could be made subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of a state by means of pro ceedings taken directly against the property yet jurisdic tion to pronounce a personal judgment could not be acquired by reason of the existence of property within the state that the property could not be taken by force of such a judgment and that since the Fourteenth Amendment the validity of such a judgment might be directly questioned and its enforcement resisted This decision as we have said t Dicey Conf Laws p 237 citing In re Busfield I886 32 Ch Div C A I23 131 judgment of Cotton L J 2 I877 95 U S 714 442JURISDICTION OVER NONRESIDENTS has been followed and affirmed in many cases in the State and Federal Courts and it is now pretty generally conceded that such judgments must be held invalid by the courts of the state in which they are pronounced even though they are expressly authorized by the Legislature In Massachusetts it has been held that under these de cisions of the Supreme Court and in view of the Four teenth Amendment a judgment rendered in Massachusetts against a nonresident not served with process is void for want of jurisdiction and may be reversed on writ of error and may be shown to be void2 by pleadings and proofs in a suit upon the judgment In New York a judgment against a nonresident was set aside on petition when it was made to appear that he had not authorized the appearance that was entered for him nor had any notice of the pendency of the suit3 In New Jersey4 the Court of Errors and Appeals has gone so far as to hold that a bill must be dismissed as against a foreign corporation not served with process within the State although it was made a party only with a view to restoring to it property alleged to have been wrongfully transferred to another corporation within the State The property was not real estate but only patent rights and the court regarded the suit as one in personafiz and not in ren and held that the absent defendant had not been brought before the court by due process of law5 1Eliot v McCormick 1887 144 Mass Io 2 Needham v Thayer 1888 I47 Mass 536 3 Vilas v Plattsburgh  Montreal R R Co 1890 123 N Y 440 4Wilson v American

decisions there was no discussion of the national ity or citizenship of the parties or of the place of making or the place of performance of the contract or of the place where the cause of action arose as the basis of the compe tence of the court to take jurisdiction of the controversy The emphasis was laid entirely upon the service of the process upon the defendant within the territory in which the action was brought There are cases in which it was held that when the defendant was residing within the terri tory service at his place of residence under the rules of practice governing the court would be a basis of jurisdic tion even though he was not found there1 and in these cases the residence of the defendant is perhaps regarded as his domicile and as analogous to nationality and as render ing the defendant subject to the laws of the State relating to legal procedure but in most cases the rule laid down is that personal service of process is necessary to jurisdiction2 and the question of the place of origin of the liability sued on is not considered In England on the other hand stat utes and rules of court authorizing service of process beyond the territory are accepted as a sufficient warrant for the exercise of jurisdiction and the judgments are regarded as binding in the English Courts without regard to the ques tion whether they ought to be recognized by the courts of other nations The English courts do not take the ground that service of process beyond the jurisdiction is not due process of law or that it is contrary to natural justice to enter a judg ment

directing service of notice abroad and there has been developed a definite and well ordered system based on principle as well as on practical considerations by which the English courts take juris diction over nonresidents in certain classes of actions in personam as well as in suits relating to property within the territory The statutory provisions intended originally for giving notice to nonresidents in suits in equity relating to prop erty in England have been extended to suits at law relat ing to causes of action arising in England and to many other cases of purely personal demands and on the con solidation of the courts the rules relating to service out of the jurisdiction were formulated without regard to the dis tinction between law and equity The principles and practice of service out of the jurisdiction have been dis cussed in a long line of cases and have been made the sub ject of an elaborate and learned treatise by Francis Taylor Piggott of the Middle Temple1 in which by the way no reference is made to the line of decisions in the United States This discussion of the subject in cases and text books is interesting and important for us in this country at this time in view of the apparent tendency of the courts to apply the doctrine of Pennoyer v Neff2 to cases in which they are not bound under the Constitution to accept it as law and in view of the great practical necessity there is for giving some effect to service of notice beyond the limits of the several states within one country It may be interesting therefore to give some account of the English statutes and rules of court on the subject and to refer to some of the leading cases The act of 2 Will IV c 33 and 4 and 5 Will IV c 82 provided for notice to nonresidents in suits in equity for the enforcement of liens on land or on the public stocks This provision was similar to those that were made at an early day in this country for publication of notices in suits 1 Service out of the

to this English statute Lord Westbury in Cookney v Anderson2 held that where it appears on the face of the bill that at the time suit was brought the defendant was resident in a foreign country and that the suit does not relate to any of the subjects in which the court is warranted in exercising jurisdiction against persons so resident the defendant may demur to the juris diction The thirtythird of the Consolidated Orders of 1845 was not confined to suits concerning land and stocks but gave the court a discretion according to the circumstances of the case to permit service of the subpoena abroad Of this Vice Chancellor Wigram said 3 The question of international law and the effect foreign courts will give the judgment need not be considered The only question is whether the general order gave the court power to make the order in this case The order gives the court power to make the order in all cases The material question in judicial proceedings is whether the defendant had due notice and not whether he received it at Dover or Boulogne Lord Westburys opinion was criticised and Vice Chan cellor Wigrams was followed by Lord Chelmsford in Drummond v Drummond4 where it was said that the rules of court had the force of statutes and the ques tion was not what service out of the jurisdiction ought to be authorized but what had been authorized and that the question of the effect of the judgment belonged to the courts of the defendants residence In Whaley v Bus fields Lord Justice Cotton said If any act of Parliament gives the courts jurisdiction over British subjects wherever they may be such jurisdiction is valid but apart from statutes a court has no jurisdiction over any person beyond its limits These cases were suits in equity and the orders were analogous to our statutes providing for publication in equity cases 1 In New Jersey the first statute providing for an order of publication was passed September 26 1772 and referred especially to mortgagors who withdrew themselves from the Province Allinsons Laws page 373 See also act of March 12 1798 Paterson Laws page 303 and the act of Feb ruary 29 1820 Rev I82I p 702 Elmers Dig 60 2 I863 De G J  S 365 3

nonresidents in actions at law in certain cases this was not limited to suits against British subjects and the only difference made between British subjects and foreigners was that in case of the former the writ of summons itself might be served abroad while in case of the latter notice of the writ must be served The statute authorized a judgment to be entered against a defendant served with summons or notice abroad in case the judge was satisfied by affidavit that there was a cause of action which arose within the jurisdiction or in respect to a breach of contract made within the jurisdiction Chapter 85 Sec 42 of 2021 Victoria makes this provision expressly applicable to a foreigner by domicile or origin1 Under these acts the jurisdiction of the court was based not upon the nationality of the defendant nor upon the service of process upon him within the territory but upon the fact that the defendant entered into a contract in England or committed in England the act out of which the cause of action arose Referring to these acts Cresswell J said in Simonin v Mellac2  The parties by professing to enter into a contract in England mutually gave to each other the right to have the force and effect of the contract determined by the English tribunal citing Huberus 65 Tit I and referring to John Voet Boullenois Donellus and Story3 This however had reference to a contract of marriage On the consolidation of the courts of law and equity in 1875 orders regulating procedure were made by the courts under authority of Parliament these orders were re modelled in 1883 and

rules i and 2 made in I883 and Order XLV II A rules II i made in I89I Order XI rule i declares that service out of the jurisdiction of a summons or notice of summons may be made by the court or a judge in seven specified cases Some of these relate to cases involving property within the jurisdiction or persons domiciled or ordinarily resident there Three of the clauses are as follows Whenever e The action is founded on any breach or alleged breach within the jurisdiction of any contract wherever made which ac cording to the terms thereof ought to be performed within the jurisdiction unless the defendant is domiciled or ordinarily resident in Scotland or Ireland or g Any person out of the jurisdiction is a necessary or proper party to an action properly brought against some other person duly served within the jurisdiction or f here an injunction is sought as to any thing to be done within the jurisdiction or where any nuisance within the jurisdiction is sought to be prevented or removed whether damages are or are not also sought in respect thereof These rules make distinct provision for service outside of the jurisdiction in certain classes of actions in personam and under these rules the English courts hold themselves bound to pronounce judgment against parties served with summons or notice abroad even though they are non residents and are not British subjects In the case of British subjects the summons itself must be served and in other cases notice of the summons Under these orders the English Courts have taken juris diction in actions purely in personam against nonresident foreigners in cases in which the only basis of jurisdiction was that the contract ought to be performed  in Eng land although there was no property in England which was the subjectmatter of the suit In Robey v Snaefell Mining Company1 it was held that when an engine maker in England sold machinery to a company domiciled in the Isle of Man where the machinery was delivered the price was payable in England and the contract was one that ought to be performed in England and leave was granted to serve the writ in the Isle of Man In Hewitson v Fabre2 when goods were delivered in England to a Frenchman residing in Bordeaux no question was made but that leave to serve notice of the writ would have been given but it was held that service of the writ itself was a nullity In 1 887

carrying on business in Hamburg in an action for the price of goods sold to him in Germany by a merchant doing business in England There are many cases to the same effect where no question is made as to the jurisdiction of the English Court over a foreigner nor as to the extra territorial effect of the judgment but leave to serve notice of the writs is given if it appears that the con tract by the terms thereof ought to be performed within the jurisdiction  2 In one case where a contract was made and to be per formed in India and there were several parties some in Great Britain and one in India the court said that conve vience required that the case should be tried in England and approved an order for service out of the jurisdiction3 On the other hand in a case in which the jurisdiction was based on an application for an injunction against doing an act in England leave to serve notice in France was re fused when it appeared that the suit was an action by a Frenchman against a Frenchman on a matter governed by French Law and arising out of a contract made in France4 Under the Common Law Procedure acts the court re fused to construe the language to include foreign corpora tions and judgment could be rendered only against British subjects and foreigners resident abroad but Order XI of the rules of 1875 has been held to apply to any nonresident defendant whether a person or a

caution in requiring a British subject to come from a distant colony to answer a case in England An affidavit must be required showing a cause of action in England Bearing in mind that as applied to a foreigner unless we were careful we might be assum ing a jurisdiction which would be treated by a foreign government as a nul lity I think the court ought to require satisfactory evidence before issu ing the writ There is another rule of court Order IX rule 6 relat ing to service in suits against partnerships in the firm name and as to this there has been a question whether it was in tended to apply to firms consisting wholly or partly of for eigners residing abroad In considering this the courts have considered the question of jurisdiction and of the power of Parliament to legislate with respect to foreigners In Russell v Cambefort in the Court of Appeal2 Lord Justice Cotton with the concurrence of Fry LJ and Lopez J said Although an act of Parliament can give jurisdiction to the court against British subjects as to foreigners Parliament has not and does not assume to have jurisdiction against those who are residing abroad and have not submitted to the jurisdiction of the English Courts Therefore in con struing the rule we must have regard to what Parliament has power to do and in my opinion we should be wrong in construing it as giving jurisdic tion against those who are in no way subject This was followed in Western National Bank of New York v Perez3 In this case the firm had no place of business in England and all its members were domiciled and resident abroad but bne of them was served with process in England under rule 6 of Order IX Bowen LJ and Lindley J held that this rule did not apply but that service of notice might have been made under Order XI in a suit against the indi vidual partners by name but Lord Esher was of opinion that service on the partners in England was good as against the firm So also in Dobson v Festi Rasini  Co4 it was held that

partner abroad to enter judgment against the firm A change in the rules was made in 1891 and Order XLVIII A with eleven rules was adopted in the place of Order IX rule 6 and other orders relating to the suits against firms The new order referred to firms carrying on business within the jurisdiction and service at the place of business is to be deemed good service on members of the firm whether any of the members are out of the jurisdic tion or not It does expressly include foreigners resident abroad and there was a question whether in view of the decision in Russell v Cambefort it was to be construed as applicable to others than British subjects The earlier cases on this question are discussed by Mr Piggott in his book on  Service Out of the Jurisdiction written in 1892 He says There are strong hints conveyed in some of them that the whole process of service out of the jurisdiction in its accepted interpretation as applicable to foreigners is wrong But there are many opinions of other Judges in the contrary sense and the decisions of the courts make it clear beyond question that there is an intention to include foreigners within its operation But this leads to two constitutional questions of great gravity Is this inclusion of foreigners in excess of what has been called the well known limitation to the power of Parliament And if it is are the courts bound to enforce the provisions of such an enactment In I894 the new rule came before Lord Esher and the other judges in the Queens Bench Division2 He held that reading the new with the old it is now immaterial whether the writ is against an English firm or against a foreign or colonial firm and the only question is whether the firm carries on business within the jurisdiction If it does whether it is an English or a foreign firm a writ may be 1 Piggott Service Out of the Jurisdiction The cases referred to on this subject are the following Russell v Cambefort I889 23 Q B Div 526 Credits Gerundeuse v Van Weede 1884

the purpose of this decision nothing turned on whether the defendants owed allegiance to the Queen There was no discussion of the principles of territorial jurisdiction but Davey L J said  These provisions appear to me to form a clear and reasonable code of rules with regard to suing and enforcing judgment against a partnership which is carrying on business under the protection of our law Shortly before this a case was decided by the Privy Council1 in which the courts approval was given to the statutes by which the courts of New Zealand are allowed to proceed without service of notice of the writ when the defendant is absent in an action upon contract to be per formed within the colony The court said it was proper that the courts should in any case of contracts made or to be performed in New Zealand have the power of judging whether they will or not proceed in the absence of the de fendant In answer to the argument that a judgment so obtained could not be enforced beyond the limits of New Zealand Lord Hobhouse said that it was not relevant and that the test of the validity of the statutes was whether they tended to promote the peace order and good govern ment of New Zealand The English courts recognize that they cannot pro nounce a valid judgment when they have not jurisdiction but under the orders of court permitting service to be made on a foreigner abroad in cases relating to contracts made in England or to be performed in England they do not admit that the service of process within their own terri tory is essential to jurisdiction nor that the service of a foreigner abroad in a suit on an English contract is not due process of law In ex parte Blain in re Sawers in the Court of Appeals James L J said 2 If you make a contract in England under a particular act of Parlia ment a particular procedure may be taken by which we may effectually try the question of that contract or that breach and give an execution against any property of yours in the country but that is because the property is within the protection and subject to the power of the English law To what extent the decision of such a question would be recognized abroad remains to be considered and must be determined by the tribunal abroad Ashbury v Ellis 1893 A C 339 2 I879 12 Ch Div 522 452JURISDICTION 0 VER NONRESIDENTS With respect to the international validity of judgment Earl Selborne in his opinion quoted in the early part of this article1 recognizes the rule prevailing in the United States that a judgment in an action in personam will not be recognized in a foreign nation if the defendant not being a subject was not served with process within the territory and he says that no exception is made in favor of the country in which the contract was made or to be performed but that in these cases as well as all others the courts of the country in which the defendant resides have the power and they ought to be resorted to to do justice He does say however that judgments against nonresidents in actions in personam will be recognized in the country of the forum by which they are pronounced if they are authorized by local statutes It is precisely on this point as we have said that the re cent decisions in the United States are at variance with the decisions of the courts of England The decision in Pen noyer v Neff2 was that the judgment in Oregon obtained in accordance with the laws of Oregon was invalid in Oregon when tested in a court of the United States There was in that case no suggestion of jurisdiction based on nationality or citizenship or of a contract made or to be performed there The action of the court was sought to be justified on the ground that there was property within the state on which execution might be levied and this was condemned by the Supreme Court and the property levied on was de clared to have been taken without due process of law and in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment This decision involving a provision of the Constitution regulating the judicial action in the several States is binding upon the State Courts and the ruling has therefore been followed in the Courts of the State and State Courts have held that judgment so rendered in pursuance of the statutes regulat ing their own procedure were void as against nonresidents and subject to be reversed on error3 But it is to be observed that it is only when property is taken that the Fourteenth Amendment applies In York v t Sirdar Gurdyal Singh v Rajah of Faridkote I894 A C 670 2 1887 95 U S 714 3 Needham v Thayer i888 147 Mass 536 Wilson v Palace Car Co 1903 65 N J Eq 730 Eliot v McCormick 1887 144 Mass Io 453COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW Texas1 the Supreme Court declined to reverse a judgment conceded to be void against a non resident saying that the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment could only be in voked when an attempt should be made to deprive the party of his property The State Courts may properly say as was said irl Needham v Thayer that they will not sus tain a judgment which it is unlawful to execute but it by no means follows that the State court must declare that all provisions of their statutes for service out of the jurisdic tion are of no effect in actions in personam They may re fuse to set aside an order of publication in such cases as was done in New Jersey in Kirkpatrick v Post2 and in view of the English decisions we have referred to they may well consider whether as a matter of principle there is not something else than service within the territory which may properly be made by legislative sanction the basis of juris diction in certain cases and whether it is contrary to natural justice to provide as the English Rules of Court provide that one who makes a contract within the State should be subject to suit on that contract within the State on actual notice given to him in a neighbouring State It is especially important in this country where business and social relations are not divided by State lines that the limits of jurisdiction should not be defined more sharply than justice and sound principle require and there is great danger of miscarriage of justice if no State can acquire jurisdiction in cases where the necessary parties defendant reside in different States It may be well in cer tain classes of cases to take jurisdiction when authorized by statute so far as to attempt to bring all parties before the court and leave it to be determined on the decree whether the jurisdiction is rightfully acquired and even after decree the constitutional rights of nonresidents may be asserted when an attempt is made to take property under execu tion Property may not be taken without due process of law and the Supreme Court has decided that a judgment against a nonresident not served with process without any basis of jurisdiction beyond a statute providing for publi cation or notice abroad is not due process of law but this decision does not preclude the State courts from entering I890 137 U S 15 2 1895 53 N J Eq 591 454JURISDICTION OVER NONRESIDENTS judgment so long as no property is taken in execution and until it comes to the question of taking property the State courts are technically at least at liberty to determine for themselves whether the statutes of their own States defining the cases in which notice of process may be served abroad do not in fact constitute due process of law If for ex ample the State statutes are like those adopted in England in the Common Law Procedure Act of 1852 and provide for service outside of the State  in causes of action which arose within the jurisdiction and in respect to a breach of a contract made within the jurisdiction must it be said be fore any attempt to take property is made that a service of reasonable notice in a neighboring State is contrary to nat ural justice and is not due process of law  The jurisdiction of the forum of the obligation is recognized in systems based on the Roman law and is recognized in England in the stat utes providing for notice to nonresidents If in the nature or the subject matter of the contract there is a local basis of jurisdiction there is at least respectable authority in the English and Continental courts for sustaining the validity of statutes based on such a theory of jurisdiction even though they may provide for services of notice on non residents abroad These considerations may be applicable in dealing with the liabilities of stockholders and directors of corporations and of other cases of like character in which it may fairly be assumed that the nonresident by entering into the contract or association or relation within the juris diction submitted himself to the laws governing the trans action and to the judgment of the courts of the State or country EDWARD Q KEASBEY 455

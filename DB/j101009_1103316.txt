VIRGINIA I TIE VIRGINIA STATUTE The Virginia statute is as follows Va Code 1904 Sec 2902 Whenever the death of a person shall be caused by the wrongful act neglect or default of any person or corporation or of any ship or vessel and the act neglect or default is such as would if death had not ensued have entitled the party injured to maintain an action or to proceed in rem against said ship or vessel or in personam against the owners thereof or those having control of her and to recover damages in respect thereof then and in every such case the person who or corporation or ship or vessel which would have been liable if death had not ensued shall be liable to an action for damages or if a ship or vessel to a libel in rem arid her owners or those responsible for her acts or defaults or negligence to a libel in personam notwithstanding the death of the person injured and although the death shall have been caused under such circum stances as amount in law to a felony 187071 p 27 Sec 2903 Every such action shall be brought by and in the name of the personal representative of such deceased person and within twelve months after his or her death but if any such action is brought within said period of twelve months after said partys death and for any cause abates or is dismissed without determining the merits of said action the time said action is pending shall not be counted as any part of said period of twelve months and another suit may be brought within the remaining period of said twelve months as if such former suit had not been instituted The jury in any such action may award such damages as to it may seem fair and just not exceeding ten The references are to Cooley on Torts Students edition by Lewis and to Chases Cases on Torts 2d edition15 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER thousand dollars and may direct in what proportion they shall be distributed to the wife husband or child or if there be no wife husband or child then to the parents brothers and sisters of the deceased But nothing in this section shall be construed to deprive the court of the power to grant new trials as in other cases 187071 p 27 1904 p 110 Sec 2904 The amount recovered in any such action shall be paid to the personal representative and after the payment of costs and reasonable attorneys fees shall be distributed by such personal representative to the wife husband and child or if there be no wife husband or child then to the parents brothers and sisters of the deceased in such proportions as the jury may have directed or if they have not directed according to the statute of distributions and shall be free from all debts and liabilities of the deceased but if there be no wife husband child parent brother or sister the amount so received shall be assets in the hands of the personal representative to be disposed of according to law This and the preceding section are subject to this proviso Where there is a widowed mother of the deceased and a widow but no children of the deceased the amount recovered shall be divided between the mother and the widow in such portions as the jury or the court may direct 187071 p 27 1904 p 110 Sec 2905 The personal representative of the deceased may compromise any claim to damages arising under section twenty nine hundred and two with the consent of the persons who would be entitled to the damages recovered in an action therefor brought by such representative under section twentynine hundred and three or if any such persons are incapable from any cause of giving consent the personal representative may make the com promise with the approval of the judge of the circuit court of the county or the circuit or corporation court of the corporation wherein such an action is allowed by law to be brought Such approval may be applied for by the personal representative on petition to the said judge in term or vacation stating the com promise the terms thereof and reasons therefor and convening the parties in interest If the judge approve the compromise and the parties in interest do not agree upon the distribution to be made of what has been or may be received by the personal March 826DEATH BY WRONGFUL ACT representative under the said compromise or if any of them are incapable of making a valid agreement the judge may direct such distribution as a jury might direct under section twentynine hundred and three as to damages awarded by them In other respects what is received by the personal representative under the compromise shall be treated as if recovered by him in an action under the section last mentioned When the judge acts in vacation he shall return all the papers in the case and orders made therein to the clerks office of his said court The clerk shall file the papers in his office as soon as received and forth with enter the orders in the order book on the law side of the court Such orders and all the proceedings in vacation shall have the same force and effect as if made or had in term Sec 2906 The right of action under sections twentynine hundred and two and twentynine hundred and three shall not determine nor the action when brought abate by the death of the defendant or the dissolution of the corporation when a corporation is the defendant and where an action is brought by a party injured for damage caused by the wrongful act neglect or default of any person or corporation and the party injured dies pending the action the action shall not abate by reason of his death but his death being suggested it may be revived in the name of his personal representative 18778 p 221 18934 p 83 II CONSTRUCTION OF THE VIRGINIA STATUTE 1 Historical The original Virginia statute giving a right of action for death by wrongful act neglect or default was enacted January 14 1871 Va Acts 187071 p 27 the com mon law which allowed no civil action for damages for the death of a man being changed on account of the recent disaster involving loss of life at Jerrys Run on the Chesapeake  Ohio Railway some miles east of the Greenbrier White Sul phur Springs For the commonlaw doctrine referred to above see Cooley  142 Chase 623 Hutchinson on Carriers 2nd Ed  777 Fpr the English statute known as Lord Camp bells Act passed in 1846 on which the American statutes are founded see Cooley  143 2 Death of servant wife child At common law the superior 1910 82715 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER in the relation of master and servant husband and wife and parent and child viz master husband parent could recover damages for an injury caused to the inferior in the relation viz servant wife child by a third persons wrongful act neglect or default by which there was a loss of service or consortium And if such injury after an interval of languishing caused the death of the inferior the superior could recover damages for the loss of service or consortium intermediate the injury and the death But the dogma no action for the death of a man and the maxim actio personalis moritur cum pcrsona forbade any recovery by the superior for loss of service or consortium subse quent to the inferiors death and caused thereby See Baker v Bolton 1 Camp 493 by Lord Ellenborough Osborn v Gillett L R 8 Ex 88 2 Va Law Reg 3 article entitled A Bit of Legal History by H R Preston In the recent case of Stevenson v Ritter Lumber Co 108 Va 575 62 S E 351 a father brought an action to recover dam ages for the death of his minor son by reason of the defendants wrongful act neglect and default and claimed that under the Virginia statute set out above  2902 he was entitled to recover for the loss of the services of his son from the time of his sons death to the time when be would have reached his majority It was held that the statute had no application to such a case as between superior and inferior which remained as at common law as to damages subsequent to the inferiors death and the father was denied recovery as there had been no appreciable interval between the injury and the death The court said The only effect of the statute is to change the rule of the common law that in pursuance of the maxim actio pcrsonalis moritur curm persona no right of action existed in favor of the heirs dis tributees or personal representatives of a deceased person for damages for his wrongful death    the single change in the common law wrought by the statute being that the right of action is given by it solely to the personal representative of the deceased for the benefit of the wife husband parent or child of the deceased But now by Va Acts 1904 p 110 brothers and sisters of the deceased are added to the class of beneficiaries March 828DEATH BY WRONGFUL ACT 3 When no action for death In construing  2902 above attention must be paid to the wordsand the act neglect or default is such as would if death had not ensued have entitled the party injured to maintain an action    and to recover damages in respect thereof On this condition the person who would have been liable if death had not ensued shall be liable in an action for damages notwithstanding the death of the person injured and although the death may have been caused under such circumstances as amount in law to a felony 1 Suppose the deceased for whose death the action is brought was guilty of contributory negligence Then as the act neglect or default of the defendant is not such as would if death had not ensued have entitled the injured party to main tain an action no action can be brought under the statute by his administrator to recover damages on behalf of the bene ficiaries who would otherwise have been entitled Chesapeake etc R Co v Rogers 100 Va 324 41 S E 732 Norfolk etc R Co v Cheatwood 103 Va 350 49 S E 439 Brammer v Norfolk etc R Co 104 Va 50 51 S E 211 Pendleton v Richmond etc R Co 104 Va 813 52 S E 754 Cooley  150 Hutchinson  789b 2 But suppose the deceased was not guilty of contributory negligence as in case e g of a child too young to be capable thereof but there was contributory negligence on the part of the sole beneficiary of the deceased his father or mother as the case might be proximately contributing to the injury causing his death If now the administrator of the child sues to recover damages for his death alleging that it was caused by the defend ants wrongful act neglect or default does the beneficiarys contributory negligence bar the administrators action On this point there has been some conflict of opinion but now by the decided weight of authority it is held that by the beneficiarys negligence the administrators action is barred And this for the reason that otherwise the beneficiary would profit by his own wrong In order to prevent this result the courts read into the statute the beneficiarys freedom from contributory negligence as a condition precedent to the administrators recovery of damages on his benalf Cooley  150 Hutchinson  789b Richmond etc R Co v Martin 102 Va 201 45 S E 1910 82915 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER 894 repudiating contrary dictum in Norfolk etc R Co v Groseclose 88 Va 267 13 S E 454 Davis v Seaboard etc R Co 136 N C 115 48 S E 591 But see Consolidated etc Co v Hone 59 N J Law 275 35 Atl 299 s c on appeal 60 N J Law 444 38 Atl 759 where it is held in the lower court the judges being equally divided on appeal that as the deceased was himself free from contributory negligence and if he had not died could have recovered damages for his injury then by the very words of the statute the defendant is liable when the death does ensue and the beneficiarys negligence is irrelevant 3 But the words if the act neglect or default is such as would if death had not ensued have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and to recover damages in respect thereof are construed as applicable and as defeating the administrators recovery not only when as in the above cases by reason of the deceaseds or beneficiarys negligence there never was any right of action for the death caused by the injury but also when although there once was potentially such right of action it has been lost by the conduct of the person injured previous to his death Thus it is well settled that the administrators action for the death of the person injured is barred if such person has compromised for the injury or accepted satisfaction therefor previous to his death Cooley  150 Hutchinson  789b Louisville etc R Co v McElwain 98 Ky 700 34 S W 236 34 L R A 788 and subjectnote Southern Bell etc Co v Cassin 111 Ga 575 37 L R A 694 4 Death pending suit Va Code  2906 above declares where an action is brought by a party injured for damages caused by the wrongful act neglect or default of any person or corporation and the party injured dies pending the action the action shall not abate by reason of his death but his death being suggested it may be revived in the name of his personal repre sentative These words have been construed as follows 1 In Birmingham v Chesapeake etc R Co 98 Va 548 37 S E 17 it is said referring to  2906 The object intended to be accomplished was we think to give the right of revival in cases where the plaintiff died pending the action without regard to the cause of death Before the amendment March 830DEATH BY WRONGFUL ACT Va Acts 189394 p 83 an action to recover damages for personal injuries could not be revived except in those cases where the plaintiff died as the result of the injuries complained of whereas under the law as amended if the plaintiff die pend ing the action no matter from what cause the action may be revived Suppose then the injured person institutes an action for damages and dies pending the action from a disease say small pox in nowise connected with or caused by his injury Then by  2906 as above construed the action can be revived in the name of the administrator and continue to judgment but mani festly as there has been no death by the defendants wrongful act the revived action must be the continuation in all respects of the commonlaw action already begun by the deceased for damages for his injury irrespective of death Hence such action would not come under the death by wrongful act statute and the recovery of damages if any would be assets of the deceaseds estate and liable for his debts the recovery not being limited to 10000 and going after payment of debts to the next of kin by the statute of distributions 2 But stppose when the injured person has brought an action not supposing his hurt to be mortal he dies pending the action fromz the injury received and the action is revived in the name of his administrator Is such action under  2906 the same common law action with the consequences explained under 1 above or is it the statutory action for death governed by the same rules in all respect as if the action had been first brought by the administrator of the deceased after his death This question is answered in Brammer v Norfolk etc R Co 107 Va 206 57 S E 593 where it is held that it is the statutory action There Brammer instituted an action for dam ages for injury caused by the wrongful act neglect and default of the defendant but died in consequence of such injury pend ing the suit The action was revived in the name of Brammers administrator but recovery was defeated by reason of Bram mers contributory negligence See Brammer v Norfolk etc R Co 104 Va 50 51 S E 211 Afterwards an action was brought for the same injury by Brammers administrator on the theory that the former action had been both when brought 1910 83115 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER and after revival a commonlaw action and so was no bar to a second action under the statute But the court held 107 Va 206 above that the judgment in the first action was res adjudicata to the second using this language But one action can be maintained to recover damages for injury resulting in death caused by the wrongful act neglect or default of another person or corporation as there is but one cause of action in such a case and whether that action be brought by the injured party in his lifetime and revived after his death during the pendency of the action in the name of his personal representative or a new action be brought within the statutory period as provided in the statute but one recovery can be had and that for the next of kin nominated in the statute where they exist as in this case Therefore if there be a recovery in the action revived or if it be adjudicated in that ac tion that the injured party had no right of action at his death it is conclusive of against the right to maintain another action to recover damages for the same injury 5 Statute gives new right of action Under Death by Wrongful Act etc statutes a question has arisen as to the nature of the statutory action Is it the survival by force of the statute of the commonlaw action which the deceased would have had for his injury if death had not ensued therefrom Or is it a new action dependent it is true on a right of action in the deceased at the time of his death but nevertheless distinct therefrom and not a survival thereof See on this point Hutchinson  789 Cooley  144 In Anderson v Hygeia Hotel Co 92 Va 687 24 S E 269 it was decided that  2902 above creates a new and distinct cause of action The reasoning of the court is as follows Where the right of action which the deceased person had in his lifetime survives his personal representative sues as the legal owner of the personal estate which has passed to him in course of law and the recovery is for the benefit of and constitutes assets of the estate of the decedent with the consequent liability for the payment of his debts The right of action of the personal representative is the same that was possessed by the deceased in his lifetime It proceeds on the same principles is sustained 832 MarchDEATH BY WRONGFUL ACT by the same evidence and the measure of the recovery is the same But very different is the right of action given by the act in question The act requires the suit to be brought by and in the name of the personal representative but he by no means sues in his general right of personal representative He sues wholly by virtue of the statute and in respect of a different right His suit proceeds on different principles He sues not for the bene fit of the estate but primarily and substantially as trustee for certain particular kindred of the deceased who are designated in the statute If the effect of the statute is as was contended to cause the right of action of the injured person to survive the suit by his personal representative would be to recover damages for the injury the deceased had sustained and the detriment caused to his estate The same kind of evidence would be necessary and admissible to support the action that would be proper if the injured person himself were suing There would be the same elements of damage for the consideration of the jury in assessing the damages The evidence would mainly relate to and the damages be for the physical and mental suffer ing of the deceased and the injury and loss genera ly sustained by him and his estate But in a suit by the personal repre sentative under the statute the evidence would primarily relate to and the damages be not only for the pecuniary loss the wife husband parent or child and brothers and sisters by the amendment of  2904 as the case might be had sustained but it would be proper for the jury in computing the damages to take also into consideration the grief and mental anguish of such relatives and their loss in being deprived of the care attention and society of the deceased and to include therefor in the verdict such sum as the jury might deem fair and just not exceeding 10000 The limit of recovery too is different In the one case at common law for injury the amount of the recovery is limited only by the amount of the loss that may be proved In the other under the statute for death the recovery cannot in any case exceed 10000 Then again if the action were only a survival of the right of action of the injured person the 1910 83315 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER recovery would constitute assets of his estate and be subject to the payment of his debts Whereas it is expressly declared by the statute that the amount recovered under the statutory right of action except where there are no such kindred as are designated by the statute shall be free from all debts and liabilities of the deceased See also Brammer v Norfolk etc R Co 107 Va 206 57 S E 593 explaining Anderson v Hygeia Hotel Co above 6 AMcasurc of damages As to the measure of damages for death by wrongful act it is held in England and in the United States generally that the damages are limited to the pecuniary loss that has been sustained by the beneficiaries Cooley  151 Hutchi zson  784 But in Virginia construing the language of  2902 The jury in any such action may award such damages as to it may seett fair anld just not exceeding 10000 it was held in Matthews v Warner 29 Gratt 570 that the jury is not confined in assessing damages to mere pecuniary loss and in jury to the beneficiaries but can take into consideration their men tal suffering caused for example as in that case to a mother by the death of her son This was followed in Baltimore etc R Co v Noell 32 Gratt 394 and instructions were approved that the jury could add to the pecuniary loss to a mother from the death of her son 1 compensation for the loss of his care attention and society to his mother and 2 such further sum as tlle jury may deem fair and just by way of solace and comfort to his mother for the sorrowv suffering and mental anguish occasioned to her by his death These two cases as to the measure of damages have been repeatedly followed in Virginia See Portsmouth Street R Co v Peed 102 Va 662 47 S E 850 Norfolk etc R Co v Cheatwood 103 Va 356 49 S E 439 In Pocahontas Collieries Co v Rukas 104 Va 278 51 S E 449 the following instruc tions to the jury were approved by the Court of Appeals If you believe that the plaintiff is entitled to recover in this case under the law and the evidence then in ascertaining the damages of the plaintiff you may consider 1 The pecuniary loss sustained by the widow and infant children of Anton Rukas by his death fixing the same at such 834 MarchDEATH BY WRONGFUL ACT sum as would be equal to the probable earnings of the said Anton Rukas taking into consideration the age business capacity experience and health of the deceased during what would probably have been his lifetime had he not been killed 2 By adding thereto compensation for the loss of his care attention and society to his widow and children 3 By adding such further sum as you may deem fair and just by way of solace and comfort to his said wife and children for the sorrow suffering and mental anguish occasioned to them by his death In Chesapeake etc R Co v Rogers 100 Va 324 41 S E 732 the instruction as to damages was in the usual form except that the jury were told that they could add damages for the mental and physical anguish of the deceased and this instruc tion was approved by the Court of Appeals The judgment for the plaintiff was reversed on other ground and this part of the instruction may not have received deliberate attention According to the reasoning in Anderson v Hygeia Hotel Co ante the mental and physical anguish of the deceased would seem to be irrelevant as an element in the measure of damages of the beneficiaries unless as evidence to enable the jury to estimate the mental anguish of the beneficiaries where the death of a husband or father for example occurs not instantaneously but after an interval of suffering and under harrowing circum stances In Chesapeake etc R Co v Ghees Admx Va 66 S E 826 the widow of the deceased testifying as a witness was permitted over objection to answer questions concerning the pecuniary condition of the deceased the object being to show his poverty anl this was held to be reversible error citing Southern R Co v Simmons 105 Va 651 55 S E 459 Pennsylvania R Co v Roy 102 U S 451 The court said We are of olinion that this evidence was irrelevant and im proper andl should have been excluded since it was not material to any issue in the case Such evitlence was calculated to excite the sympathy of the jury or as stated by some of the courts to stimulate their sympathy and this sympathy was well cal culated to influence the jury not only as to the quaZntlum of damages they should allow but in the letermination of the 1910 83515 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER question whether the case upon the evidence was for the plaintiff or the defendant The principle that such evidence is presumed to have wrongfully affected the verdict seems to be settled by the decisions of this court In Norfolk etc R Co v Spencer 104 Va 657 52 S E 310 it is held that standard tables of mortality may be introduced in evidence in order to ascertain the probable duration but for the injury of the life of the deceased And see also Norfolk etc R Co v Cheatwood 103 Va 356 49 S E 439 But in Norfolk etc R Co v Phillips 100 Va 362 41 S E 726 it was said We do not regard it as essential that mortality tables be proven in the case These tables were made for the purpose of life insurance and annuities where the very shortest time is fixed as affecting pecuniary risks They are regarded as falling short in most instances of the actual duration of human life 7 Classes of beneficiaries As to the beneficiaries of the recovery for death by wrongful act etc the present Virginia statute declares  2904 that the amount recovered shall after the payment of costs and reasonable attorneys fees be dis tributed by the personal representative to the wife husband or child or if there be no wife husband or child then to the parents brothers and sisters of the deceased in such propor tions as the jury may have directed or if they have not directed according to the statute of distributions and shall be free from all debts and liabilities of the deceased The original statute did not include brothers and sisters among the beneficiaries and parents were placed in the same class with wife husband and child of the deceased among whom the distribution was to be in the proportions directed by the jury But by the present statute  2904 amended by Acts of 1904 p 110 there are two classes of beneficiaries viz 1 a pre ferred class consisting of wife husband and child and 2 a deferred class consisting of parents brothers and sisters and while the jury have discretion see  2903 to apportion the recovery among the members of the class entitled thereto the members of the deferred class are not to take at all except in the absence of all the members of the preferred class In one case however the priority of the preferred class must be set aside by the jury and a member of the deferred class mother 836 MarchDEATH BY WRONGFUL ACT allowed to come in with a member of the preferred class wife For by the proviso to  2904 Where there is a widowed mother of the deceased and a widow but no children of the deceased the amount recovered shall be divided between the mother and the widow in such portions as the jury or the court where by consent of parties the judge tries the case without a jury may direct Under  2903 2904 above an interesting question arises as to the disposition of the damages when the jury have failed to direct as under  2903 they might have done in what pro portions the damages awarded shall be distributed to the wife husband or child of the deceased or if there be no wife husband or child then to the deceaseds parents brothers and sisters By  2904 it is declared that if the jury have not directed the proportions among the members of the preferred or deferred class as the case may be then the amount recovered shall be distributed according to the statute of distributions But to whomi is the recovery to be distributed according to the statute of distributions Is the distribution confined to the enumerated members of the preferred or deferred class so that the statute should be interpreted as if its language were as follows To the wife husband and child in such proportions as the jury have directed or if they have not directed then to wife husband and child according to the statute of distributions and if there be no wife husband or child then To parents brothers and sisters in such proportions as the jury have directed or if they have not directed to parents brotlhrs and sisters accord ing to the statute of distributions Or on the failure of the jury to direct the proportions among the members of one or the other class are the enumerated members to be ignored as such and the distribution to be made to those entitled under the statute of distributions as the next of kin to the deceased whether they are or not members of the named class of beneficiaries  To the writer it seems clear that the torner view is the true construction of the statute and that it was never intended in any case to allow relatives outside of the described classes as a grandchild or a nephew or more remote relative of the deceased to share with those enumerated in one or the other 1910 83715 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER class of beneficiaries The amount received by such unnamed relative would then be free from all debts and liabilities of the deceased But a relative outside of the class of enumerated beneficiaries can share death damages it is believed only when there is no wife husband child parent brother or sister in which case the statute declares that the amount so received shall be assets in the hands of the personal representative to be disposed of according to law and thus of course liable for the debts of the deceased But this view is opposed to the decision of the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond in Pinchum v Southern R Co 10 Va Law Reg 62 where it is held by the learned judge that on the failure of the jury to direct the proportions among the class of beneficiaries the amount recovered is to be distributed irrespective of the class to those entitled as next of kin by the statute of distributions free from the debts and liabilities of the deceased 8 Aliens as beneficiaries As to whether the beneficiaries under statutes giving an action for death by wrongful act etc can be alien relatives of the deceased resident in another State of the Union or in a foreign country has been the subject of some controversy In Pocahontas Collieries Co v Rukas 104 Va 278 51 S E 499 where the cause of death was in Virginia and the beneficiaries were aliens resident in West Virginia the court held that the right of aliens domiciled in the United States though nonresidents of Virginia to the benefits and remedies afforded by  2902 and  2904 of the Va Code is sustained by authority and in accordance with sound policy and justice In Low Moor Iron Co v La Bianca 106 Va 83 55 S E 532 the beneficiaries were aliens resident in a foreign country Sicily subjects of the King of Italy and it was held that such aliens were also entitled as beneficiaries under the Virginia statute The court quotes with approval this language from Alfson v Bush Co 182 N Y 393 75 N E 330 108 Am St Rep 815 The damages are imposed upon a negligent em ployer as compensation to those who suffer by his act and there is no valid reason as it seems to us why they should not be paid to the survivors whether residing here or in some foreign juris March 838DEATH BY WRONGFUL ACT diction The statute not only benefits the survivors but protects the laboring man as it tends to enforce observance by the em ployer of the rule requiring him to furnish his servant a safe place in which to work The laborer leaving wife and children behind him and coining here from abroad has a right to enter into the contract of employment fully relying on the statute The conflict of authority in England and our sister states leads us to deal with this question on principle and to base our answer to it on reasons that are weighty and controlling 9 Conflict of Laws Under the conflict of laws an interest ing question arises where the cause of death occurs in one State but the action therefor is brought in another It was at one time supposed that the new statutory right of action for the death of a man in derogation of the principles of the common law was in its nature penal and so enforceable only under the law of the State where the cause of death occurred Cooley  145 Hutchiiison  789a Chascs Cases on Torts 2d Ed 683 note to Nelson v Chesapeake etc R Co 88 Va 971 14 S E 838 But this view as the above citations show is now repudiated by the weight of authority and the recognized doctrine is as laid down in Nelson v Chesapeake etc R Co ante that an action to recover damages for a death caused by the wrongful act of another though statutory only may be maintained in another State than that in which the injury was committed if such ac tion is not inconsistent with the laws or public policy of the state in which it is brought or prejudicial to its interests It is there fore sufficient to maintain the action in Virginia for example if Virginia and the other State in which the injury causing death occurred have similar statutes giving a right of action for death by wrongful act neglect or default But it must be remembered that the right of action is by the statute of the State where the injury occurred and that the other State having jurisdiction over the person of the defendant enforces this foreign right by comity in its forum but in accordance with the foreign law Norfolk etc R Co v Denny 106 Va 383 56 S E 321 fol lowing Nelson v Chesapeake etc R Co antc Dowell v Cox 108 Va 460 62 S E 272 where death has been caused in a sister State the law of that State governs as to the extent of 1910 83915 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER the remedy Hedrick v Southern R Co 136 N C 510 48 S E 836 brakeman killed in Virginia by overhead bridge Stewart v Baltimore etc R Co 168 U S 445 14 Am St Rep 353355 note 56 L R A 193 note 10 Statute of Limitations As to the time within which an action must be brought for death by wrongful act etc the Vir ginia Statute  2903 enacts Every such action shall be brought by and in the name of the personal representative of such deceased person and within twelve months after his or her death But this period of limitation unlike the ordinary stat utes of limitation to actions on contract and tort does not merely affect the remedy but enters organically and integrally into the constitution of the new right of action unknown to the common law which the statute creates and permits to be enforced pro vided the action is brought within the Statutory period Time thus becomes of the essence of the right and the right itself is extinguished if no action is begun within the prescribed period It follows as a corollary of the above that the declaration must show as an element of the plaintiffs case that the action is brought within the prescribed time after the death and if it does not do so objection may be taken by demurrer And if such allegation of time is made the contrary may be shown under the general issue of not guilty without a special plea It also follows that the period of limitation is that of the State where the cause of death occurred and not that of the State where the action is brought The lex fori governs remedy but this is a question not of remedy but of right Manuel v Norfolk etc R Co 99 Va 188 37 S E 957 Dowell v Cox 108 Va 460 62 S E 388 Taylor v Cranberry etc Coal

may be added in conclusion that in Louisville etc R Co v Clarke 152 U S 230 it is held that the rule of the common law as to criminal responsibility for deaththat it must occur within a year and a day after the injuryhas no application to a civil action for damages under death by wrongful act statutes March 840DEATH BY WRONGFUL ACT Also in Hoover v Chesapeake etc R Co 46 W Va 268 33 S E 224 it is held that though the deceaseds right of action for his personal injury was already barred at the time of his death yet the action by the administrator for the death is not thereby precluded The court says In personal actions for injury the bar of the statute precludes the remedy but does not satisfy the wrong A presumption that the guilty party would rely upon the statute of limitations to avoid making satisfaction for an injury done is too violent to justify the inference that the legislature hadin contemplation the bar by limitation of the per sonal right of action i e of the deceased for his injury if he had survived in the enactment of the section under consideration i e the section giving the administrator a right of action for the death when the party injured might have maintained an ac tion if death had not ensued And this effect of the statute upon the remedy of the deceased if he had not died is distin guished from cases where the deceased had no cause of action at his death by reason of a compromise or release by him in his life time CHARLES A GRAVES University of Virgitlia 1910 841

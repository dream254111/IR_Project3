rendered that he was willing to settle for 5000 in cash an attorney took an assignment of a claim for treble damages arising from a violation of the Sherman AntiTrust Act At the time of the assignment he estimated the claim to be worth 75000 and if trebled it would consequently net him 225000 Held the transaction was champertous and therefore an action on the assignment could not be maintained Sampliner v Motion Picture Patents Co D C S D N Y 1917 243 Fed 277 At common law two elements were essential in order to make an agreement champertous first an undertaking by one person to defray the expense in whole or in part of anothers suit and second an agree ment on the part of the latter to partition with the former the proceeds if any of the litigation 4 Bl Comm 135 see Brush v City of Car bondale 1907 229 Ill 144 82 N E 252 The facts in the principal case therefore would not constitute champerty at common law since there was no agreement to divide the proceeds of the suit But under modern law the crime is stripped of its ancient technical strictness and is now a rule of public policy 17 Columbia Law Rev 335 So the buying of a chose in action by an attorney with intention to sue thereon has been held champerty in its most odious form Slade v Zeitfuss 1904 77 Conn 457 59 Atl 406 But if the assignment be in con sideration of an antecedent debt or for services rendered it is not champerty Wares Admr v Russell 1881 70 Ala 174 N Y Code of Civ Proc  76 In the instant case the assignment was in considera tion of an antecedent debt arising from services rendered Hence neither under the common law nor the modern theory was champerty committed But in view of the fact that an attorney is an officer of the court his transactions are scrutinized jealously Matter of Holland 1906

Assn 1911 101 Ark 210 142 S W 194 What is ternled champerty is often in reality professional misconduct and this seems to be the basis of the instant case It would be hard for the attorney to show that the acceptance of a claim which if successfully prosecuted would net over 200000 in payment for services valued at 5000 was not a gross speculation and an unethical traffick ing in the lawsuit of another If courts would enforce contracts of this nature legal sanction would be obtained for questionable conduct by attorneys with regard to the claims of others and the door would be open to flagrant contravention of public policy CONSENT CIRIMINAL ASSAULT BY IUSBAND ON WIFEVENEREAL DISEASEIefendant was indicted for an assault on his wife in infect ing her with syphilis The judge in

civil cases of this nature con sent is not of governing importance for as between unmarried persons it is felt to be against good policy to permit a recovery by a plaintiff who exposes herself promiscuously especially since she must have contemplated such a risk Hegarty v Shine 1878 L R 4 Ir 288 see dissenting opinion Reg v Clarence supra 54 and as between man and wife no action is maintainable because of the minity arising out of the marriage relation Bandfield v Bandfield 1898 117 Mich 80 75 N W 287 Schultz v Christopher 1911 65 Wash 496 118 Pac 629 But in criminal cases there

765 Guodwin v State 1902 114 Wis 318 90 N W 170 Consent then becones of vital importance The marital relation contemplates only healthy intercourse see dissenting opinion Beg v Clarence supra 59 and so the result in the principal case is sound not because the wifes implied consent was vitiated by the fraud but because there never was any consent to be contaminated It has even been said that the state as a third party interested in all marriages would object to a deliberate ssent to intercourse with a diseased spouse See Trammell v Vaughan 1900 158 Mo 214 59 S W 79 The principal case seems to be the first of its kind since Beg v Clarence supra which is contra but legal scholars have generally sided with the dissenting judges in that case 2 Bishop New Criminal Law 72 b 2 Beale Consent in

to leave and stay out of a specified county Subsequently the plaintiff entered this county and the defend ants discontinued the monthly payments for which the plaintiff sued on the theory that the covenant to stay out of the county was counter to policy and the promise to make no claim to his fathers estate was sufficient to bind the defendants Held for the defendant on the ground that the contract was inseparable and the promise to stay away was valid and anperformed Wallace v McPherson Tenn 1917 197 S W 565 A contract stipulating for an extreme and unreasonable abnegation of legal

to any correspondent The Psychrometer THERE have recently appeared two quite extended investiga tions on the use of the psychrometer wet and dry bulb thermom eters in determining the moisturecontents of the air The first is a comparison with the condensing hs grometer made by Pro fessor S A Hill of Allahabad India published in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal vol vii 1888 Recent investiga tions in this country have shown the entire uselessness of trying to obtain refined results with an unventilated psychrometer and we note that a partial neglect of this precaution has led to wrong inferences in this paper The experiments with the Regnault ap paratus revealed the same difficulties with the plate fumes of ether etc that have been noted by others The comparisons were made with artificial ventilation as well as in a breeze and in still air at pressures ranging from 206 to 294 inches There were twentyseven observations and of these four had an arti ficial ventilation The method of ventilation is not given but we may assume that it was sufficient to give good readings The following are the results Dew Point Pressure Dry Bulb Wet Bulb Reguault Hazen Table 2355 714 495

served at heights up to 6500 feet and that computed for a height of 600 feet from the ventilated psychrometer Without moie in formation as to the accuracy of the condensing hygrometer and the sufficiency of the ventilation it would be dangerous to argue upon these results but the coincidence between them and those obtained in this country by the writer up to 3000 feet is very remarkable Professor Hill by combining together all the ven tilated and unventilated readings obtains an exactly opposite result but it is now known that unventilated psychrometer read ings are worthless for careful comparison The second paper is by Dr Haldane and M S Pembrey of Ox ford England It is to be found in the Philosophical Magazine April 1890 pp 30633L In this paper an attempt is made to compare the unventilated psychrometer with determinations of moisture by chemical itethods The experimenters have given the chemical method an exhaustive study and their results in that line are excellent The comparisons with the psychrometer twelve in number are unsatisfactory and lead to erroneous con clusions for the reason already given Five out of the total were made in so damp an air that they cannot help in the comparison The other seven are as follows Vapc Drr Wet 1 2 616 530 613 549 637 560 615 530 630 552 641 570 646 574 Mean Mean  I or Pressure in Millimetres Computed Ob served Chemi cal 3

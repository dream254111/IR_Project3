truth The lover of truth is ready to reject every previous opinion the moment he sees reason to doubt its exactuess This particular direction of the love of truth will lead its possessor to pursue truth in every direction and especially to investigate those problems of society where the greatest addi tions to knowledge may be hoped for Scientific method we may define as simply generalized common sense I believe it was described by Clifford as organized common sense It differs from the method adopted by the man of business to decide upon the best method of conducting his affairs only in being founded on a more refined analysis of the con ditions of the problem Its necessity arises from the fact that when men apply their powers of reason and judgment to problems above those of everyday life they are prone to loose that sobriety of judgment and that grasp upon the conditions of the case which they show in the conduct of their own private affairs Business offers us an example of the most effectual elimination of the unfit and of  the survival of the fittest The man who acts upon false theories loses his money drops out of society and is no longer a factor in the result But there is no such method of elimi nation when the interests of society at large are considered The ignorant theorizer and speculator can continue writing long after his theories have been proved groundless and in any case the question whether he is right or wrong is only one of opinion I ask leave to introduce an illustration of the possibilities of scientific method in the direction alluded to Looking at the present state of knowledge of the laws of wealth and prosperity of communities we see a great re semblance to the scientific ideas entertained by mankind at large many centuries ago There is the same lack of precise ideas the same countless differences of opinion the same mass of meaningless speculation and the same ignorance of how to analyze the problem before us in the two cases Two or three cen turies ago the modern method of investigating nature was illustrated by Galileo generalized by Bacon and perfected by Newton and his contemporaries A few fundamental ideas gained a vast load of useless rubbish thrown away and a little knowledge how to go to work acquired have put a new face upon society Look at such questions as those of the tariff and currency It is impossible not to feel the need of some revolution of the same kind VOL I1L No 62 which shall lead to certain knowledge of the subject The enormous difference of opinion which prevails shows that certain knowledge is not reached by the majority if it is by any We find no fundamental principles on which there is a general agreement From what point must we view the problem in order to see our way to its solution  I reply from the scientific standpoint All such political questions as those of the tariff and the currency are in their nature scientific questions They are not matters of sentiment or feeling which can be decided by popular vote but questions of fact as effected by the mutual action and interaction of a complicated series of causes The only way to get at the truth is to analyze these causes into their com ponent elements and see in what manner each acts by itself and how that action is modified by the presence of the others in other words we must do what Galileo and Newton did to arrive at the truths of nature With this ob ject in view whatever our views of culture we may let science scientific method and the scientific spirit be the fundamental object in every scheme of a liberal education S NEWCOMuB ECCENTRIC FIGURES FROM SOUTH ERN MOUNDS IN a recent publication I have described a number of relics from the mounds that present many new and remarkable features The most important of these were two engraved shell disks the designs upon which presented very marked variations from the work usually at tributed to the moundbuilders Tracings of these are given in figs 1 and 2 Both specimens were found associated with characteristic mound relics and had undoubt edly been deposited with the dead by the builders of the mounds The question of ori gin was left for settlement to the light of future discoveries the only conclusion reached being that while the ornaments had a north ern character the designs engraved upon them were decidedly southern that is to say Mexi can or CentralAmerican Recently some im portant additions have been made to this class of works and a flood of light has been thrown upon the subject Explorations in Georgia conducted by Dr Thomas for the bureau of ethnology have brought to light two more shell gorgets bearing engraved designs of human figures Outlines of these are given in figs 3and 4 1 Proc anthrop soc Washington vol iiAPRIL 11 1884 S CIE In case there should be any question as to the place of these objects among true mound relics I present the following facts furnished by Dr Thomas from the observations of his assistant Mr Rogan The mound from which NCE 437 were obtained These contain repousse fig ures corresponding closely with those engraved on shell They are made from thin wellpol ished sheets of copper of uniform thickness some of which are a foot in width and twen FIG 2  Shell gorget from a mound in Tennessee FIG 1  Shell gorget from a mound in Missouri they were obtained belongs to the celebrated Etowah group at Cartersville Ga and is the one marked  C  in plate I of Joness  Antiq uities of the southern Indians The burials were in a layer of dark rich loam and all in wellconstructed stone cysts of the usual shape They were not all at the same depth but were near the base of the mound and in every case beneath undisturbed strata of loam sand and hardbeaten clay One of the en graved shells and three copper plates one of which is given in fig 5 were found in one grave They were deposited with a very large skeleton which had been wrapped in cloth and matting ot  ft A comparison of this pair with the examples from Mis souri and Tennessee develops many im portant points of re semblance The de signs are clearly the work of or at least have their origin have their FIG

fortunately at hand From the same mnound with the articles of shell a number of copper objects ty inches in length The figures have been stamped in high relief and the outlines alnd perforate areas cut with mechanical precision One of these curious images is shown in out line in fig 5 These objects are much corroded and bear evidence of age corresponding to that of the other relics with which they were buried Another is almost a duplicate of this while two others represent eagles Very similar to the latter is a copper eagle made also of sheet copper obtained by Major Powell from a mound in Illinois A tracing of this is given in fig 6 FIG 4  Shell gorget from a mound in Georgia With these links added to our chain we are able not only to say that all of these objects are identical in time and origin bnt to say with a fair degree of confidence what is the438 S CIE time and what the origin The use of sheet copper manufactured and manipulated with mechanical precision will to most minds be sufficient evidence of European agency and postColumbian time This view is enforced by the presence of articles of brass and iron in the mound with one of the shell objects Besides this a study of the designs them selves develops some interesting facts Four of the designs presented two on copper and two on shell represent compound creatures part bird and part man This is a character istic American conception but in the execution of details there are features very suggestive of an oriental origin The wings are for instance attached to the shoulderblades behind the arms being also present and expand symmet rically to the right and left resembling medi eval angels more closely than 3Mexican deities We notice also in the delineation of the eagle a decidedly heraldic character a symmetrical extension of the wings legs and talons highly suggestive of some imperial coat of arms In all their leading features the designs themselves are suggestive of Mexican or Cen tralAmerican work and if actually derived from some of the highly cultured nations of FIG 5Copper image from a mound in Georgia the south it is not impossible that this deri vation was through aboriginal agencies

states This is well known to have been a usual practice with our early tra ders If in the end it should turn out that these remarkable objects are the unaided work of the moundbuilders we shall be compelled to recognize their standing in the manipulation of metal and in the art of design generally as unsurpassed by any other native American people W H IIHOLES ADAPTABILITY OF THE PRAIRIES FORI ARTIFICIAL FORESTR1Y VARIOUS views have been entertained in re lation to the treeless condition of the prairies of the interior region of the United States some of which are rational some partially so and others positively erroneous The opinion has been popularly held that the prairies were originally covered with forests as the region to the eastward of them was when it was first known to white men and that from some un explained cause these forests were destroyed Those who entertain this view are disposed to discuss speculatively the origin of the prairies and practically the means of reforesting them These are views of men who lay no claim to scientific knowledge but certain persons even of scientific pretensions have claimed that the character of the soil of the prairies is such

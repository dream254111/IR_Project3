BY Louis W RAPEER PHD Professor of Education The Pennsylvania State College State College Pa Health is the first wealth and all other values rest on this How are you expressed in one form or another is one of the com monest greetings the world over Instinctively all of us recognize that life itself is the ultimate value and that our first pursuit must be the increase of its vitality and the enrichment of its meaning The nation or individual that loses this prime concern for health and normal physical development is doomed inevitably to a state of vital inefficiency especially in a complex civilization where a highly artificial life conduces to vital impairment Individual and na tional health and vigor are not merely natural concomitants of existence but are achievements to be attained by scientific study and strenuous endeavor The ancient Greeks furnish the best example of a nation which added greatly to the abundance and meaning of life by continuous training in educational hygiene from infancy The harsh demands of preparedness for possible or actual war have today led many nations to sudden consciousness of health values and of their widespread failure to achieve them INDIFFERENCE TO HEALTH PROGRAM The common indifference to a thoroughgoing program of edu cational hygiene for children and adults on the part of those who through fortunate heredity and environment have realized both health and position is our principal obstacle to progress Until these fortunate variations of a complex civilization are made to understand general health and development conditions and the means to their amelioration the democratic socialization of health and life more abundant will be ideal dreams Our leaders argue We are healthy We hardly ever give thought to our health It comes about naturally We never have to take a drop of medicine The way to be healthy is to forget it All that we need to learn about it will be acquired incidentally The answer is found in the 9798 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY undeniable health facts of our nation Disraeli expressed the proper viewpoint in these words Public health is the foundation on which reposes the happiness of the people and the power of a coun try The care of public health is the first duty of a statesman And it may well be added as a corollary that to care for individual and family health is the first and most patriotic duty of a citizen In spite of marvellous scientific discoveries and achievements in the realm of health science in recent decades we fail generally to realize how little health and normal physical development have been socialized and made a part of our common wealth Measure by any reasonable standard of physical perfection and health at random thousand of the persons who pass on the street any day and what is the result Learn how many out of each thousand persons living in the community remain at home out of sight and un noticed ill and socially ineffective Note how many of each thou sand born reach maturity Examine the children in the public schools and compute the facts Study the efficiency of parents in the homes in bringing up healthy vigorous children so trained that they will naturally retain it throughout life What is our actual health problem OUR HEALTH PROBLEM The normal span of life from birth to death is about seventy years Heredity is an important influence in determining the length of this span but environmental conditions may either play havoc with heredity or play directly into its hands One fifth to one eighth of all the babies born in this country each year die before their first birthday Oh these are the children of ignorant immi grant mothers in the slums of our great cities the reader may ex claim but the researches of health officers in New York City and Newark demonstrate that infant mortalityis far greater in the homes of our nativeborn mothers These astounding death losses occur all over the country and by effective efforts they may as has been demonstrated be reduced far below the general average of the coun try as a whole in even our most congested cities What is possible in communities taken for demonstration is possible for whole states and the nation at large Onefourth to onesixth of all the children born each year in this country die before reaching the school age of six and countless thousands who have survived enter our schoolsHEALTH AS A MEANS TO HAPPINESS AND EFFICIENCY 99 so weakened and maimed by disease and physical defects that they have little chance of profiting by even the most hygienic schooling or of living to the period of productive maturity Each year ap proximately a hundred thousand school children or children of elementary and high school age who should be in school die in this country Half of all who are born each year are in their graves before the age of thirtyan age when as we all realize most people are just ready to contribute something to the world Where is our boasted civilization when we fail so miserably in conserving human life Extensive investigation indicates that at any one time three million personsthree out of every hundred of our populationare seriously ill losing over a billion dollars a year to themselves and to society not to mention the loss of greater values in the richness vi tality and meaning of life itself While we have cut down infant mortality considerably in many places our death rate remains almost stationary because of the great and recent increase of deaths due to degenerative diseases of the heart kidneys and other organs Extensive examinations of employes of big business firms by the Life Extension Institute by Dr Kristine Mann department store women and by others prove that nearly half of the workers of our indoor city populations are low in vitality suffer from physical defects or harbor incipient or welldeveloped cases of disease State insurance of workers against illness affords strong confirm atory data Examinations for entrance into the army and navy add their evidence The greatest problem faced by England in the war has been to obtain men who after a years strenuous and scien tific educational hygiene could be brought into passable phys ical condition for filling the trenches Health is the first wealth our present losses are over half preventable without great cost we miserably fail in our first duty as individuals and as communities of citizens These are grim undeniable facts which we must reso lutely face and vigorously attack with effective weapons SCHOOL HEALTH DATA Medical supervision with its annual examination of millions of school children from kindergarten to college is today adding greatly to our knowledge of the extent to which we are providing for our 1Journal of Public Health for May 1916100 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY children reasonable conditions of health and aiding them in the achievement of physical development My own studies show that in any one year less than a third of our school children are free from serious ailments or remediable physical defects not counting teeth defects the peoples disease which affects approximately another third of the school population In many schools where no dental crusade has been carried on about two thirds of the children have teeth defects one half of these have beside their teeth defects other serious defects or diseases It would be a conservative judgment to say that on any one day of the school year at least five million of our twentytwo million school children are in serious need of vig orous remedial measures to place them in even fairly normal con dition Dr Thomas D Wood of Columbia University places it at twelve to fifteen million But even five millions of our school children taken with the other millions of the 30 per cent of our entire population a hundred millions under the age of twenty give us cause for national concern Military preparedness the sinking of the Lusitania the Titanic the Eastland or the Slocum the destruc tion of thousands in such fires as those of the Iroquois the Collin wood or San Francisco are all serious attentionseizing concerns but the important preparedness and the important life and health losses which should command the continuous and searching scrutiny and coperative effort of our citizens are the losses and drains on national vitality which we have so meagerly sketched above What are we going to do about it That is the question HEALTH PROGRESS Well what have we accomplished In view of our possibil ities we must admit very little A hundred years from now our descendants will look back upon our indifference to health conser vation as we look back upon the indifference and opposition to public schools of less than a hundred years ago A curve or graph showing the rise of public and private interest in and efforts for physical improvement would show a high mode for the ancient Greeks an almost zero or negative height during the middle ages a very slight and gradual rise up to a score of years ago and an abrupt and accelerating rise in these opening years of the twentieth cen tury Take any manifestation of this increased attention to the first value of life you please and the result will follow closely theHEALTH AS A MEANS TO HAPPINESS AND EFFICIENCY 101 general tendency of the curve Suppose we take the increase in the number of articles in our magazines newspapers and books de voted to health and physical development Most of my readers can remember when little health matter was published This was because there were no readers of such matter and because there were practically no writers on the subject Now all is changed Books magazines newspapers pamphlets and like publications con taining health contributions are literally crowding our book shelves and our mails Much of this matter is not widely read and much of it is perhaps scarcely worth reading but that health science which has grown so magically in our research laboratories in our hospitals and by means of great experiments like the sanitation of Panama or the prophylactic measures of the Japanese army in the Russian war has advanced some twenty to forty years beyond the masses of our people no one acquainted with the facts can doubt We need this adult schooling through all the agencies of publicity and we need a radically improved educational hygiene in connection with our public schools that will result in types of health education which will produce results RECENT HEALTH ACHIEVEMENTS It would be profitable to realize just what advancement in health provisions has been accomplished in the last few years The playground and recreation movement has swept across this country like fire in prairie grass Millions are today spent along these lines where nickles were expended in 1900 The movement is already becoming scientific and is being standardized Scientific health sur veys of play and recreation for old and young are becoming every day more common Likewise medical inspection school nursing school dentalclinics public and school baths more sanitary school buildings with gymnasia sanitary drinking fountains humidified air scientific lighting movable schooldeskchairs openair and openwindow schools the feeding of school children care in schools for mental defectives cripples the blind and other unfortunate deviates and an enormously improved public health service in most cities and in many statesall bear witness to the rebirth of the physical consciousness of the race of which ages of asceticism ignorant autocracy and misdirected individualism almost robbed us Today we are beginning to realize the prime human values to102 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY face our national health problems and to lay secure foundations for personal and national physical efficiency HEALTH PROMOTION AND EDUCATION A great surprise has been the inevitable tendency of all these reform movements to revert to the public schools Laws may be written but only healtheducated legislatures will pass them or make them sound and effective Only healtheducated constit uents citizens at home who have had some health education and physical training will support health legislation or live up to it when it is passed Milk stations and other philanthropies may be pro vided out of the purse of Mr and Mrs Greatwealth but the prac tical instruction not the pure milk handed out saves the babies lives The general the most radical and most effective method of health promotion is that of education Knowledge habits ideals and appreciations must be developed in any population which is to be superiorly fit To develop these in an adult population is to a slight degree possible Much is and must be accomplished through adult education Education along any line must be a life process But direct instruction and persuasion of adults is in a democracy almost insignificant in effectiveness as compared with the same amount of effort expended upon plastic childhood The public school is the hope of democracy for health as well as for citizenship Our federal government should require thorough annual or more frequent physical examinations of all persons from birth on should provide and enforce thoroughgoing physical education of all per sons throughout life should control absolutely the sanitation of all our life environment should eliminate the hereditary subdeviates and provide for eight hours a day of leisure and wholesome recrea tion as well as skilled medical attention for all persons If these measures were taken the problems of educational hygiene would not be so great But we have an individualistic democracy in which the person is monarch of himself and all he possesses as a property right with few but increasing exceptions We have not yet the hardihood nor the power of co6peration to provide and maintain vigorous physical development agencies of a compulsory character Yet we are going far in this direction We give our boards of health more power today than we give our police Public insurance eradication of infectious diseases and their causes pubHEALTH AS A MEANS TO HAPPINESS AND EFFICIENCY 103 licschool health provisions a tendency on the part of the govern ment to require only a physicallydesirable day of work from its employes and the spread of this movement in many great indus tries the tendency to require health examinations before entering upon and while engaged in many kinds of public service such as teaching and the lifeanddeath authority handed over to the government in great disasters such as fires floods earthquakes epidemics and othersall point to more vigorous and commanding health direction and supervision of a compulsory character on the part of the state in the near future But still our chief instrument of health promotion for our own good as individuals and as a nation must be the instructed and trained selfactive person THE SCHOOLS OPPORTUNITY AND RESPONSIBILITY There are many still who conceive of health and physical de velopment as only a very minor care of our schools Many ignore this aimof schooling entirely Most schools public and private in this country have been erected and equipped with little attention to this aim as a prominent one in education Our high schools for example almost entirely omit hygiene how to live as either an elective or a required subject Physical education and medical supervision are still in most schools conspicuous by their absence Only a small proportion of our elementary schools teach hygiene effectively and use the better textbooks made available in the last few years Investigations of normal schools show that student teachers do not generally get training along this line Hygiene is absent even as an elective from most college curricula notwith standing the fact that our people schooled and unschooled continue to fall by tens of thousands before typhoid tuberculosis and many other preventable diseases or vitalityrobbing defects These products of our schooling systems are the ones who are losing their precious children needlessly or are failing to strengthen and equip them for meeting the serious strains of modern complex life Here is a woman who is the proud possessor of a Phi Beta Kappa key obtained for superior scholarship from one of our lead ing universities Her husband also achieved a similar key They are husband and wife and they have a baby nearly a year old That baby is almost dying of rickets Its growth and development are permanently retarded The cause is the poor feeding which the104 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY mother gives it She learned much of the mummies of Egypt of the wars of the Romans of the several languages required for college entrance and the bachelors degree of the algebra geometry etc likewise required and many other interesting and possibly attrac tive disciplines and cultural subjects But she didnt learn a thing about how to preserve her own or her babys health nor did her husband They didnt study the duties of parenthood here to day in America in a city flat they got  training in reasoning obser vation concentration and the technique of investigation but they didnt get ability to observe the condition of their child to study up on baby feeding or to investigate to seek authority and to fol low sound advice when the condition of their child was at last made obvious to them They had learned many things and had surpassed most of their fellows in the process but they had failed to learn how to live healthily and their ignorance of the hygiene of their child was no more profound than their ignorance regarding their own health True and typical examples of this kind have probably come to the attention of every reader Vital efficiency should stand first among the aims of education The school as a public universal agency dedicated to the ameliora tion of the condition of all the people must take the lead and this it is beginning manfully to do There is no doubt about the future development along this line A few progressive systems have experimentally led and the many will follow What proves suc cessful at Newark Gary Boston Los Angeles or a single county in a great state may soon be adopted and required of all Educational hygiene is an important phase of our great national democratizing process EDUCATIONAL HYGIENE The special phases of the whole school process of educational hygiene are about five in number They are as follows 1 Medical supervisionmedical inspection examination cure and prevention 2 School sanitationa wholesome environment for every child 3 Physical educationplay gymnastics folk dances physical work 4 The teaching of hygienehealth instruction of young and oldHEALTH AS A MEANS TO HAPPINESS AND EFFICIENCY 105 5 The hygiene of methodswholesome ways of guiding chil dren These five divisions in many school systemscity county and stateare being organized under one head The term hygiene is as broad as the terms health and physical development and broader than the term physical education as it has come to be known The goddess Hygieia of the ancient Greeks was solicitous for the entire physical wellbeing of man Some would substitute the term phys ical education for educational hygiene or school hygiene but they will probably not prevail Some insist that the field is too vast to be directed by one man and that the amount of medical gymnastic recreational psychological and sanitary knowledge and training such a director would require is too vast to be expected of any one person But the same may be said of the superintendent of schools or the head of any one of our big business corporations We have found organization from one center generally profitable and effective If men with medical degrees and physical education diplomas are not available or the present course in these various lines not sat isfactory for one who is to be director or supervisor of hygiene in a school system such courses will surely be provided and suitably trained men will inevitably be forthcoming Others would call the whole department the department of health or of health supervision But such a designation would frequently lead to confusion both as to the scope of the department and as to whether the general city health department or the school health department were meant The department of hygiene and the supervisor of hygiene are perhaps the most desirable designations for the schools We need not use the term school hygiene any more than we would use the term school drawing or school penmanship These departments and these supervisors in public school systems have no need for such redundancy We emphasize these distinctions in administration because they outline the scope help to get the right start and encourage sound development of this whole school movement for national health and vitality The field is enticing and expanding Recent discoveries in ventilation for example which destroy the old lackofoxygen and surplusofcarbondioxide theory of bad N entilation on which our school houses and ventilating plants are constructed will greatly106 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY modify this phase of school architecture and sanitation in the di rection of

published little more than roughly sketches the outlines of the several fields2 2Educational Hygiene Edited by L W Rapeer Scribners Sons New York

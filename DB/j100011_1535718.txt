exhaustive treatment of the subject  the intention is rather to summarize briefly the work that has been done upon the development of the lamellibranch gill and to describe somewhat fully certain phe nomena in the development of the gill of Mytilus which seem thus far to have escaped notice A few incidental observations on gill development in other lamellibranch genera are added TERMINOLOGY The term ctenidium is used in the following pages to designate the entire respiratory apparatus of one side of the body The halves of each ctenidium are called in accordance with common though questionable usage the gills outer and inner respectively according to position adjacent to the mantle or to the body mass Each gill again is composed of two lamellae called respectively the direct or descending and reflexed or ascending The same terms are employed in describing the limbs of the filaments com posing the lamellae It will be noticed that the reflexed lamellae and filament limbs of the outer and inner gills are turned in opposite directionsthat of the inner gill toward the body that of the outer gill toward the mantle The Mytilus gill is of a very simple filibranchiate type in which the interfilamentary con nections between neighboring filament limbs of the same lamella 1 The studies upon which the present paper is based were carried on largely in the Marine Biological Laboratory Woods Hole Mass and the Harpswell Laboratory South Harpswell Me I am happy at this opportunity to express my appreciation of the courtesies and assistance extended by the directors of these institutions Professors C 0 Whitman and J S Kingsley and by their associates 6I Vol XIV No 2EDWARD L RICE are represented solely by tufts of interlocking cilia the ciliated disks Fig 7 B a The interlamellar connections are also very simple consisting of hollow cylindrical bridges several of which extend between the two limbs of each adult filament Fig 7 B b RESUME OF PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS The classic on the development of the gill in the Lamelli branchiata is the paper by LucazeDuthiers 56 entitled  Me moire sur le developpement des branchies des mollusques aceph ales lamellibranches A preliminary report 54 preceded it The first anlage of the ctenidium is described as a row of papillae arising inside the mantle along the line of juncture of mantle and body These lengthen bend back upon themselves and become the filaments of the inner gill Later a second series of similar papilla form just outside the first and develop simi larly into the outer gill Each gill thus passes through a stage in which it is composed of a row of unbent filaments hanging down in the mantle cavity The work of LucazeDuthiers was preceded by two interesting papers by Loven 49 in which young bivalves of several species are described and clearly figured with the ctenidium consisting of from three to ten free filaments belonging to the inner gill The material was obtained from the plankton and the identification Mya Tellina Mytilus Mactra and Nucula are hesitatingly named was recognized as very questionable by Loven himself More over little account of the development is given Since the time of Loven and LacazeDuthiers the investigation of gill development has been extended to a considerable number of widely separated genera of lamellibranchs Early stages of Cyclas were studied by 0 Schmidt 54 and his work on this genus has been extended by Leydig 55 Stepanoff 65 and Ziegler 85 while Lankester 75 gives brief notes on the closely allied genus Pisidium Unio and Anodonta have been described by Braun 78 Schierholz 78 89 and F Schmidt 85 The earliest stages of the gill of Teredo have been described briefly and not very clearly by Hatschek 80 Sigerfoos 96 has confirmed the observations of Hatschek and extended them to much later stages 62GILL DEVELOPMENT IN MYTILUS Ostrea has been briefly considered by Ryder 84 and Stafford Cos5 Mytilus has been equally briefly described by Wilson 87 Dreissensia is known through the work of Korschelt 9I Weltner 91 and Meisenheimer oi And finally the gill development of the peculiar and primi tive Nuculidae Nucula and Yoldia has been very carefully fol lowed by Drew 99 oi The accounts are for the most part brief in some cases only incidental and there are various points of divergence in detail One such divergence appears at first to be fundamental While LacazeDuthiers describes the first anlage of the gills as a series of isolated papillae the majority of the authors cited trace the ctenidium back to a longitudinal fold or ridge which is second arily constricted transversely and divided into the papillae Thus emphatically among later writers Ziegler for Cyclas Schierholz for Unio and Sigerfoos for Teredo Drew describes a primary ridge and secondary papillae in the Nuculidae but considers the change to be  due to unequal growth more than to constriction  his figures however give evidence of considerable constriction On the other hand Wilson confirms the early view of Lacaze Duthiers for Mytilus and my own observations are entirely in accord with this view Concerning Dreissensia Korschelt 91 p 144 expresses himself thus cautiously Ob sie the gills in Form einer Falte angelegt werden die sich schon sehr bald einkerbt und so jene vermeintlichen Papillen entstehen lasst oder ob sie als wirklichen Papillen hervorsprossen ist schwer zu entscheiden In the adult of all forms a continuous and undivided gill axis may be recognized comparable with this embryonic fold or ridge Upon this are carried the filaments comparable with the embry onic papillae The whole divergence then reduces itself to a question of the relative time of development and is one of minor importance Much more significant is the general uniformity of development and the recognition by all the authors cited and in all the genera studied of a stage in which each ctenidium is rep resented by a series of simple papillae belonging to the inner gill and of a later stage in which the outer gill is formed of a par allel series of corresponding papillae 63EDWARD L RICE Concerning the process of elongation and flexure by which the embryonic papillae are metamorphosed into the definitive filaments of the adult gill in all forms except the very primitive Proto branchia the authors are again in the fullest agreement so far as their attention has been turned to this later development and this plan of development has been generally accepted as charac teristic of the whole class STAGES OF GILL DEVELOPMENT IN MYTILUS The following tabulation gives the size of the animal and the number of filaments present in the gills at certain of the more important stages in gill development The figures can be taken only as approximate as there is considerable individual variation but they probably represent fairly accurate averages as they are selected from a much larger tabulation Number of Filaments Stage Size Inner Gill Outer Gill Earliest stage in which gills were observed 030 mm 3 o Flexure of filaments of inner gill 075 mm 12 0 First appearance of outer gill 140 mm 20  Flexure of filaments of outer gill i6o mm 25 15 ORDER OF SUCCESSION OF GILL FILAMENTS IN MYTILUS LacazeDuthiers describes the order of the development of the filaments of the inner gill as from front to back the most anterior being the first to develop in the outer gill the development is described as extending in both directions so that the first devel oped filaments would come to lie in the middle of the gill with late developed filaments at both ends My observations are in accord with those of LacazeDuthiers as regards the inner gill but in the case of the outer gill amendment is required In very early stages in which the filaments of the outer gill are mere papillae the longest papilla is not the most anterior but is even posterior to the middle of the series In one speci men with ten such papillae the seventh from the front is the 1 Theoretically but a single filament should be present No stage has been actually observed with less than three or four Apparently several filaments appear almost simultaneously 64GILL DEVELOPMENT IN MYT1LUS longest the most developed and apparently the oldest Lacaze Duthiers figures an almost exactly similar stage 56 Fig 6 as well as one a little older 56 Fig 7 in which the ninth of fifteen filaments is the longest This suggests strongly a devel opment of the gill in both directions in the early stages On the other hand a comparison of these early stages with others much older shows that the position of the anterior end of the outer gill is somewhat definitely located relatively to the inner gill There seems to be some individual variation but the extension of the inner gill in front of the outer is measured in all cases observed by about ten filaments Owing to the nonpar allelism of the filaments of the two gills it is very difficult to in terpret figures that have not been drawn with reference to this particular point but a study of LacazeDuthierss plate seems to show ten such filaments in an earlier stage 56 Fig 6 and eleven in a later 56 Fig 7 As the inner gill is growing only at the posterior end and as the filaments of the two gills are arranged somewhat definitely in corresponding pairs this indicates almost certainly that the addition of filaments at the anterior end of the outer gill is confined to very early stages if present at all As regards these early stages my observations are very incon clusive In this connection it is also interesting to note that in a com paratively early stage when the animal is only about i6o mm in length and the outer gill is composed of only about sixteen filaments the anterior filament of this gill is already strongly differentiated from its neighbors in both size and shape It is decidedly thicker and longer and is furnished with a very pecu liarly enlarged and twisted termination In both total prepara tions and sections it is very distinct from the other filaments and very easily identified From this time on the development of the outer gill is clearly from front to back only and the two gills develop pari passu MODE OF FORMATION OF LATER FILAMENTS IN MYTILUS The early filaments of the Mytilus gill follow the mode of de velopment so beautifully worked out by LacazeDuthiers and outlined briefly above the later filaments follow a very differentEDWARD L RICE mode The change may be noticed in specimens but a little older than the latest stage figured by LacazeDuthiers The ctenidium has grown beyond the rather small body mass and the posterior adductor and extends free into the mantle chamber Fig I The posterior part of the ctenidium is free from the mantle except for a light attachment due to the interlocking of FIG I Posterior tip of ctenidium of Mytilus of 25 mm length viewed from in ner side Outer gill omitted except for outline represented by dotted line Magnifi cation I70 cilia This suggests the connection of neighboring gill filaments interfilamentary connections but here there is merely diffuse ciliation and no specialized ciliated disks At the posterior end the gill axis Fig I a is slightly curved upward and around this curved end the developing filaments are closely crowded and assume a radial arrangement The anterior filaments are attached to the ventral side of the axis and hang down ventrally toward the end the position becomes more and more oblique and then horizontal while the youngest filament anlagen actually project upward from the dorsal side of the axis Here all stages in filament development may be observed ar 66GILL DEVELOPMENT IN MYTILUS ranged accurately in serial order In Fig 4 are seen isolated portions from the posterior end of the ctenidium The speci mens figured are selected from a large number of dissections and are taken from several individuals of slighty varying size Hence the discrepancy in the size of the figures as all are equally magnified All the stages figured have been observed again and again From the figures it is clearly seen that we are dealing with something very different from the comparatively long and slender c ba FIG 2 Posterior tip of ctenidium of Mytiit1s of 30 mm length spread out and viewed from dorsal side Inner gill below and to right Magnification 170 rodlike papillae observed in younger specimens The youngest anlagen are rather transverse folds or ridges on the dorsal and posterior sides of the gill axis At first these ridges are compara tively short and of uniformly convex contour Figs 4 A  2 a 3 a Then the ridge elongates and becomes flat topped Figs 2 b 3 b and soon a process of differential growth or constric tion leads to a notching of the ridge near its middle Figs 2 c 3 c 4 B This notch divides the originally simple anlage into two slightly unequal parts the larger belonging to the outer gill and the smaller to the inner These two parts grow rapidly 67EDWARD L RICE Figs 4 C 4 D and may be followed readily into the charac teristic filaments of their respective gills Figs 2 and 3 In this connection it should be strongly emphasized that the filament anlagen here described are by no means the equivalent of the papillae described by Lacaze c b a Duthiers although their appear ance in such a stage as that figured in Fig 4 D is strikingly similar The undivided transverse fold Fig yC i llljl 4 A contains potentially an entire     j filament of each gill and each of jI jits subdivisions Fig 4 D is the equivalent of the two limbs of a filament placed side by side On the other hand the earlier type of    anlage must be considered as the equivalent of only one limb of the definitive filament or perhaps better of the two placed end to end In FIG 3 Posterior tip of ctenid the earlier type the reflexed limb of ium of Mytilus of 45 mm length the filament originates through a viewed from inner side Magnifica bending of the anlage in the later tion 170 bendng of the anlage in the later type there is no bending but rather a longitudinal splitting The exact details of this splitting and the formation of the cavity within the gill shown in Fig 4 E have not been worked out but a study of a series of specimens such as those represented in Fig 4 makes it clear that the process consists essentially in a thinning and ultimate perforation of the platelike anlage of Fig 4 D Corroborative evidence as to the nature of these later filament anlagen and their distinction from the earlier and more anterior ones is found in the character of the ciliation A comparison of Figs 4 and 5 is instructive in this connection Fig 5 is drawn from a section but the filaments of the gills have been slightly reconstructed from neighboring sections so that they are repre sented in their entirety This represents an earlier filament of the outer gill Fig 5 b with its characteristic rodlike form Details of the ciliation have been omitted except for the some 68GILL DEVELOPMENT IN MYTILUS what diagrammatic representation of the highly specialized cili ated epithelium characteristic of the outer side of the filament i e the side turned away from the cavity of the gill Thus in the inner gill Fig 5 a the outside of each limb of the bent filament shows this characteristic ciliation the papilla or unbent filament of the outer gill is ciliated on only one side and that the side corresponding to the outside of the direct limb In the later filaments Fig 4 the conditions are very different In the A B C D FIG 4 Isolated

epithelium is clearly distinguishable and is located on both sides of the anlage show ing the equivalence of the latter to both limbs of the flexed filament Another difference between early and late filament formation is found in the relations of the upper end of the reflexed filament limb In the earlier filaments the reflexed limb developed at the free end of the direct limb is primarily free In Mytilus it retains this freedom  1 but in many lamellibranchs the upper ends of reflexed filament limbs are secondarily fused with the 1 Even in Mytilus there is a fusion of the upper ends of the reflexed filament limbs with one another to form a somewhat definite border to the reflexed lamella of the gill 69EDWARD L RICE mantle outer gill or body inner gill In the later type of de velopment the upper end of the reflexed limb is primarily united with the gill axis Fig 4 D and only secondarily attains its freedom The details of the process have not been studied In the specimen represented in Fig 4 E this separation had not taken place but the reflexed limbs were torn loose in the dis section as indicated by the rough edges FIG 5 Section through ctenidium of Mytilus of i6 mm length

mm length Section passes through middle of posterior adductor a filament of inner gill b filament of outer gill c mantle d posterior adductor Magnification 140 At first sight the two modes of filament formation seem fun damentally distinct but the change from one to the other is bridged by all intermediate gradations A comparison of Figs 4 5 and 6 gives some suggestion of the transition in the case of the inner gill and the process is identical for the outer gill Figs 5 and 6 are taken from the same animal Fig 6 being more posterior thus showing a later filament in a younger stage of development But it will be found by measurement that the ratio of the length of the reflexed limb to the direct limb of the filament of the inner gill is almost the same in the two cases thus showing a precocious flexure of the posterior filament A 70GILL DEVELOPMENT IN MYTILUS further advance in this precocity leads to the condition found in a still later filament Fig 4 in which the flexure may be con sidered as having already occurred at the time when the filament is first budded forth Thus it is possible to conceive the later method of develop ment as derived from the earlier but it is equally possible so far as mere geometrical relations are concerned to reverse the series and consider the later mode as really primitive the earlier mode as a specialization It may be that the feeding require ments of the young animal are such as to require an adaptive modification in the direction of a speedy lengthening of the gill filaments but it is likewise possible that the later mode of devel opment is an adaptation to some factor or combination of factors in the life of the older animals The startling similarity of the anlage of the later filaments to the gill in young specimens of the very primitive Nucula as figured by Drew oi Fig 46 make it very tempting to interpret the later type as primitive but the structures are in such undeveloped condition that such compari sons are hazardous The safe course is a suspension of judgment FILAMENT DEVELOPMENT IN OTHER LAMELLIBRANCHS In connection with the above observations on Mytilus the gill development in various other forms has been hastily studied for comparison Mya is the only genus in which very young speci mens have been observed Here the early development seems to agree essentially with LacazeDuthiers description of Mytilus Later stages have been studied in Mya Anomia Modiola and Arca In all these genera the development of the later filaments follows the scheme here set forth for Mytilus It is highly prob able that this modification of development is characteristic of the later filaments in the Lamellibranchiata in general DEVELOPMENT OF INTERLAMELLAR CONNECTIONS IN MYTILUS The contrast of the interlamellar connections in the closely related genera Mytilus and Modiola has been emphasized in a former paper 98 In Mytilus these connections Fig 7 B b are irregularly cylindrical and each contains a large blood cavity communicating with the cavities in the two limbs of the filament 7IEDWARD L RICE There are several such bridges between the limbs of each fila ment in a wellgrown specimen The particular filament figured had three interlamellar connections but other filaments of the same animal showed four In Modiola on the other hand the filament limbs are united A B by a continuous mem i jffl H F brane Fig 7 A b which X S extends from the point of t a k K X flexure for more than half the length of the reflexed limb Sectioning shows ii X   i that this membrane is 41 X i composed of a very loose

X X other grounds than gill structure the view was ex      X pressed in a former paper M 98 that Modiola is the I tl    that connection the a 4   A priori argument was ad ji  EJ vanced that the

DEVELOPMENT IN MYTILUS rence in the gill but the order of developmental stages is not the same In the latest stage Fig 8 E an interlamellar connec tion is present at a considerable distance from the tip of the fila ment in the next younger stages Figs 8 A 8 C the connec tion is found nearer and nearer to the tip of the filament Finally in the earliest stage Fig 8 B there is no distinct connection but the distance through which the two limbs of the filament are in union at the tip as compared with the much shorter distance in Figs 8 A 8 C or 8 E shows a potential interlamellar con nection in an undeveloped condition The comparison with the  I   0 b   a A B C D E FIG 8 Tips of five consecutive filaments of inner gill of Mytilus of 6 mm length showing formation of first interlamellar

evident and it is hardly going too far to call this a  Modiola stage  in the develop ment of the filament of Mytilus Perhaps the most interesting stage in the development of the interlamellar connection is shown in Fig 8 D which shows clearly the mode of formation of the Mytilis type of connection from its Modiolalike anlage The filaments shown in Fig 8 were first studied and sketched as total preparations then sec tioned The study of the total preparation indicated that the area bounded by dotted lines in Fig 8 D was not an opening 73EDWARD L RICE like that separating off the interlamellar connection in the other filaments The appearance was rather that of a thinner spot or constriction preliminary to complete perforation Study of the sections fully confirmed this interpretation In Fig 9 three such sections are represented their positions being represented by light horizontal lines in Fig 8 D The section nearest the tip Fig 9 A shows a direct connection between the cavities of the two A B C FIG 9 Transverse sections of filament represented in Fig 8 D Position of sections shown by horizontal lines in Fig 8 D marked with corresponding letters Magnification 540 filament limbs in the neighborhood of the edge of the gill Cor responding sections of other filaments show the same arrangement The section farthest from the tip Fig 9 C shows an essentially similar arrangement which is duplicated by sections through the interlamellar connections of the other filaments In the inter mediate section Fig 9 B the gill filament is strongly constricted and the connection of the cavities of the two limbs is entirely interrupted The next stage would be a complete perforation in place of this constriction and the local separation of the filament limbs Three successive degrees of such separation are shown in Figs 8 C 8 A2 and 8 E 74GILL DEVELOPMENT IN MYTILUS DEVELOPMENT OF INTERLAMELLAR CONNECTIONS IN OTHER LAMELLIBRANCHS All stages in the development of the interlamellar connections in Mytilus have been repeatedly observed but the investigation has not been extended to other genera The similarity of the structure of the interlamellar connections in certain other forms e g Astarte suggests similarity of development But in the majority of the lamellibranchs the structure of these connections resembles Modiola rather than Mytilus GENERAL CONCLUSIONS There is a very striking parallel in Mytius between the forma tion of the interlamellar connections p 7I and the separation of the two limbs of the later gill filaments p 68 In each case a flat platelike organ becomes locally thinner and is finally per forated The parallel may be extended though less fully to the separation of the upper ends of the reflexed limbs of these later filaments from the gill axis p 70 As regards the two latter processes at least the parallel has been further extended to em brace several other widely divergent genera p 71 and is prob ably capable of general application Moreover an essentially similar process may be recognized in the formation of slits in the primitive gill fold as described by Hatschek 80 and Sigerfoos 96 for Teredo and by Ziegler 85 for Cyclas The general process of perforation or separation in gill development appears to be of very common occurrence among the lamellibranchs The opposed process of fusion is equally characteristic In the Mytilus gill this process is reduced to a minimum but it may be noted in the fusion of the ends of the reflexed filament limbs Other forms however show a high degree of fusion in the development of complicated interfilamentary connections repre sented in Mytilus by the simple ciliated disks and an entirely different type of fusion has been noted in a former paper oo as occurring in certain of the complexly folded gills And finally IThis paper has been criticised by W G Ridewood  On the Structure of the Gills of the Lamellibranchia Phil Trans Royal Soc London Ser 3 Vol 195 1903 who holds that the phenomena there described should be interpreted as the result of a splitting of filaments not a fusion I see no reason to change my previous view As regards the present argument splitting like fusion would indicate plas ticity of the gill 75EDWARD L RICE in many genera there is a more or less extensive fusion of the reflexed lamella of the outer gill with the mantle and of the inner gill with the body mass or posteriorly with the corre sponding lamella of the other ctenidium The frequency and prominence of these two opposed processes in development strengthen the conviction earlier expressed 98 that the lamellibranch gill is an extremely plastic organ and one very liable to adaptive modification This being the case it is not an organ of fundamental phylogenetic importance and has been given an altogether undue prominence in recent classifica tions of the Lamellibranchiata OHIO WESLEYAN UNIVERSITY DELAWARE OHIO LITERATURE Braun M 78

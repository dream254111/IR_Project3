lead to the conclusion that the district system must be abandoned To do this in Congressional elections it will not be necessary to return to the system of a general state ticket elected by the majority party of each state which was the custom in the first quarter of the century and which is still employed in the case of the presidential electors A modification of that discarded system could be adopted by introducing some simple device of proportional repre sentation Proportional representation is not a new thing in politics although it has heretofore received but limited application Twenty years ago there was abundant discussion of plans for minority and proportional representation and out of the discussion in our own country a crude plan of cumulative voting was adopted by some of the municipalities of Penn sylvania and for the election of members of the lower house of the Illinois legislature This plan is still in force It has been recently applied to all private corporations by the new constitutions of Kentucky North and South Dakota and Montana The Illinois system for the election of state representatives was submitted to the people by the Constitu tional Convention of South Dakota but was defeated at the polls In Denmark another plan of minority representation has been in force since 1856 But the most important appli cation of proportional representation has been made by the Canton of Neuchatel in Switzerland and more recently by the Canton of Ticino Something like the Swiss plan could be profitably adopted in the election of all our re presentative assemblies and boards 700PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION For Congressional elections let each state elect its entire quota of representatives on a general ticket Let each party in the state convention nominate the entire list or as many candidates as it could probably elect adding a few names for favorable contingencies Then in canvassing the returns let the representatives be assigned to each party in propor tion to the popular vote of the party giving preference to the candidates according to their standing on the vote For example Ohio in the elections of I890 cast 713 I52 votes for Congressmen The number of Congressmen to be elected was twentyone This gives a quota of 33959 votes to each Congressman The Republicans cast 362624 votes which gives them ten representatives and a remainder of 23034 votes The Democrats cast 350528 votes giving them ten representatives and a remainder of o1928 votes The Prohibition vote was 2I89I and the Union Labor vote 3223 There being twentyone representatives to elect and the Republicans having a remainder above their ten quotas larger than the Democratic remainder and larger than the total Prohibition or Union Labor vote they get the addi tional representative Thus the Ohio delegation would stand eleven Republicans and ten Democrats At present under the gerrymander of I890 it is seven Republicans and fourteen Democrats In the election of state legislatures the state could be divided ilto districts each electing five seven or some odd number of representatives and the electors of each district would vote for the entire list of names on their party ticket the quotas and proportions being obtained as above For example the county of Cuyahoga including the city of Cleveland sends repeatedly a solid delegation of six Re publicans to the Ohio State Legislature elected on a general county ticket and not one Democrat By the proportional system there would be three Democrats and three Republi cans The county of Hamilton including the city of Cin cinnati sends to the Sixtyninth General Assembly a solid delegation of nine Democrats The Republicans of that 701 I25126 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY county are unrepresented With proportional voting the delegation would stand five Democrats four Republicans Other counties in the state send one representative each They could be grouped into districts of five and could then vote on the proportional plan In cities election districts for councils and boards of aldermen could be constructed on a similar basis Where there are two branches of the city legislature the smaller branch could be chosen on a general ticket for the city at large by the proportional system and the more numerous branch by districts of five In all elections upon this plan the different party tickets could be printed on a single ballot according to the form of the Australian ballot The order of names on each ticket would be determined by the state convention of each party and this would indicate the order of preference of the party Voters would not vote for individuals but for the ticket If individual voters took the liberty of changing the order of names they Would lose their vote altogether This pro vision is necessary in order to simplify the counting of the ballots But  bolters could nominate a new ticket and at the same time assist in electing the party ticket simply by placing their first choice at the head of their ticket and fol lowing it by names taken from the regular ticket If they were sufficiently numerous to comply with the law the privilege could be obtained of having this new ticket printed separately on the Australian ballot If now the voters of this ticket could command a quota of the entire vote they would elect their first choice and any remainder above the quota would go to the next name thus helping to elect one of the regular party nominees The new system would thus involve no waste of votes The plan here outlined is a modification of one devised by Dr L B Tuckerman of Cleveland Ohio who has de veloped it with special reference to the election of committees by conventions or massmeetings In such assemblies the oneman power of the chairman is done away with and each 702PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION party can be fairly represented on committees by its own first choice To set forth all the advantages of proportional represen tation would require an extended study of politics and parties and a careful weighing of remote causes For the present it is possible to point out only a few of the patent benefits it would confer In the first place the gerrymander wotild be absolutely abolished No other feasible plan can be thought of that will do this The gerrymander inheres in the district system So long as it is possible to redistrict a state it is hopeless to expect that a party in power will refrain from doing so to its own advantage The changes of population necessitate redistricting at least once in ten ears If legislatures be prohibited from passing such an act within a period less than ten years the party which happens to be in control of the legislature at the legal time will fasten its own gerrymander on the people for a decade with no possible chance for redress It is better to let the two parties play against each other Public opinion cannot stop the gerrymander because public opinion rejoices in this kind of titfortat The fact that one party has infamously cut up the state is good reason for the other party to retrieve itself when it gets the power If Congress should take the matter out of the hands of the State Legislature it would be simply to do its own ger rymandering while state and municipal gerrymandering would still go on as before Constitutional restrictions re quiring equal population and contiguots territory are easily evaded Notwithstanding such restrictions the populations of Congressional districts in New York vary from I07844 to 312404 In no state is the Constitution on this point observed And as for contiguity a glance at the diagram of the Eighth district of North Carolina or the First and Third districts of South Carolina will show on what a slender thread this fiction may be made to hang It seems plain that with proportional representation abler men would be attracted into legislative careers The area 703 I27128 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY of choice would be enlarged and the leaders of a party could not be driven from legislative halls where their ability is needed as was done at the last Congressional election The feeling of responsibility to the whole people would be increased in the leaders of parties because they could stand on their record before the state at large and not be compelled to dicker with petty local magnates A man is at present elected to Congress not on account of public service but according to his ability in turning spoils and appropriations into his district He does not represent before the country any great policy on which to stand or fall He must depend on local wirepulling and the exchange of favors If he has done some distinguished service for his party or has reached eminence in politics the whole strength of the National party of the opposition is thrown into his district and if possible he is gerrymandered out of office Right here however will arise the principal popular objection to this plan namely that districts would not be represented But a slight thought will show that this objec tion has no force The gerrymander has taken nearly all the virtue out of a district that it may ever have possessed There are few Congressional districts that have a unity of any kind either economical political topographical geo graphical or historical The county of Huron in Ohio has been in five different combinations during the past twelve years and now it is in the western part of a district one hundred and twenty miles long and twenty wide its Con gressional representative lives sixty miles away and had previous to the last gerrymander very little knowledge of or interest in the county In this and hundreds of other cases the candidates in some districts at the other end of the state are better known to the voters of the district than are the candidates in their own district On the other hand the state is a historical and political unit Its great men belong to no one district At present only two of them can go to the United States Senate and others are shelved as govern 704PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION ors or are compelled to seek some Presidential appoint ment Under proportional representation those who are unavailable for Senators would lead their party delegations in the House Arguments for proportional representation have usually been advanced in behalf of minorities But they are equally valid as a defence of the majority Under the system of districts and primaries less than ten per cent of the voters of a party often dictate the policy of the party Machines and ward bosses are the party rulers and the majority does not dare to bolt at the polls because the opposite party would then come into power Proportional representation would permit independent movements within the party without risking the defeat of the entire ticket simply by allowing the nomination of a new ticket composed partly of independ ents and partly of the regular ticket If the independent candidates are elected and there is a surplus of voters above the quota the surplus goes to the regular ticket The ma jority of the party would be benefited as often as the minority The present system on the face of it means the rule of the minority The gerrymander overthrows majority rule The fact that voters could not vote for individuals but must cast their ballots for the straight ticket may seem at first sight a serious objection But the objection is not valid as against the present system because even now the voter has no choice except between party tickets while under the pro posed plan independent movements are made possible with out risking the complete defeat of the party Other objections might be noted A small third party would be likely often to hold the balance of power The probability is however that there would be no occasion for third parties because reforms inside the old parties would promptly gain a hearing and compromises would head off radical bolts The strongest objections are those which come from inertia and the dread of change Constitutional amendments will be necessary in some cases though Congress has complete 705 I29130 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY power in the matter of National representatives Neverthe less representative government is not something absolute and fixed in the nature of things It is the result of circum stances and experiments without any great amount of politi cal analysis or design It grew out of the primitive mass meeting or folkmoot simply because distant electors could not conveniently come up to the annual meetings In the folkmoot the minority was of course fully represented How they should be represented in the delegate assembly was at first a problem but its solution was abandoned The history of Colonial Maryland shows in an interesting way how this came about The original deliberative and legis lative body was a primary assembly where any freeman might speak and vote In the second assembly1638 voting by proxy was allowed to those freemen who could not be present in person Abuses of this device led to the issuing of writs to the local divisions instructing them to return representatives But realizing that those who did not vote for the successful candidates would be unrepresented individuals who were in the minority were allowed to appear in their own right The third assembly was therefore an anomalous body comprising the governor and his nominees the duly elected representatives of localities those individuals who had not consented to the election of representatives and the proxies of other unrepresented individuals Such a heterogeneous mass was neither representive nor primary and was so threatening to the representative element that the hope of minority representation was given up in despair and the assembly defined its own constitution by limit ing popular representation to the elected deputies and ruling out proxies Doubtless other colonies went through similar experiences The system finally adopted is rigid in the extreme It has endured because there has been no special strain But the growing intensity of class divisions and the immensity of the interests involved call for a more elastic system Proportional  Doyle English Colonies in America 706STATE AND LIGHTING CORPORATIONS representation seems to meet this requirement in every essen tial particular JOHN R COMMONS Oberlin College THE STATE AND THE LIGHTING CORPORATIONS The business of furnishing illuminating gas is of necessity a monopoly This fact is generally recognized in Europe but has as yet been only partially accepted in this country If a person will look at the history of the various attempts to reduce the price of gas by the admission of competing companies he will be compelled to admit that the effect of these on the price lasts but a short time while the streets receive new lines of mains to increase the already great underground confusion and the capital put into these mains is wasted After two or more companies have engaged in a war of rates with its consequent frequent changes of consumers from one company to the other one of three things happens the companies raise the price to a remuterative rate and agree to make the rate of all the same or they apportion the territory to be supplied among themselves agreeing each to remain in its own district or one buys out the others In other words competition ceases and we find prices higher and probably higher than the state of the business should warrant for the companies when they agree to cease competition usually succeed in rearranging their capital in such a way as to convert into share capital the losses they may have suffered during the rate war The price of gas depends however quite as much on the amount of capital invested per unit of product as on the cost of production or to state it differently a large part of the cost to the consumer is the interest on the cost of plant This being the result of competition let us see what has been done in other directions toward protecting both con sumers and companies Municipal ownership is the cure 707 I3I132 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY suggested by many but many also object to so far increasing the power of the municipality as to make it a producer the grant of that power being a long step towards state social ism Facts are cited freely for and against municipal owner ship from the experience of municipalities in this or other countries and the deductions from the figures given are largely influenced by the desire of the writer to prove his side of the question England has provided for municipal ownership but has distinctly recognized the principle of noncompetition be tween a municipality and a private company by providing that in each case the local authorities must buy out the existing company and most of the acts provide that the purchase price shall be fixed by the earning capacity of the plant Besides this solution we find in actual practice two other forms of controlone in England and the other in Massachusetts and it is the intention of this paper to dis cuss fully the method employed in the latter State Until I860 England and especially London had compe tition and London was supplied with gas by thirteen com panies By the Metropolis Gas Act of that year the principle of noncompetition was recognized and London was divided into nine districts since reduced by consolida tions to three in each of which one company was to supply gas The next step was taken in the Gas Works Clauses Act of I871 and was intended to offer an inducement to the stockholders to reduce the price of gas as speedily as possible This was arranged for by the sliding scale which was based on the assumption that it was possible to establish a standard price for gas and a standard rate of dividend These once fixed the act provides that for every penny of reduction or increase in the price of gas the rate of dividend should be increased or decreased by onequarter of one per cent the effect of this being to share between the stock holders and the consumers any changes in the cost of pro duction 708STATE AND LIGHTING CORPORATIONS It was found in practice however that there was a flaw in this act inasmuch as no provision was made in regard to capital with the result that capital was continually issued and the standard price and the standard rate of dividend were maintained or in other words the whole saving by new economies went to the shareholders This evil was corrected in 1877 by the introduction into the act of the auction clauses which provided that new share capital should be sold at public auction and the whole proceeds including any premium received should be applied to the purposes of the company but none of such proceeds were to be used for the payment of dividends With this complement the slid ing scale has accomplished its object and the reduction in the price of gas in England has been very marked Massachusetts has had since i860 a statute fixing a standard quality of gas and providing for a State Inspector who was also to test meters for their correctness but in 1885 a distinct step forward was made in the direction of the recognition of the monopolistic nature of the gas supply and the propriety of the regulation of that monopoly by the state This the legislature of that year provided for in an act bearing the title An act to establish a Board of Gas Com missioners the principal provisions of which are as fol lows Three commissioners are to be appointed by the Governor for a term of three years each who shall have the super vision of all companies engaged in the manufacture and sale of gas and who shall whenever they find any company violating the provisions of any law report the same to the attorney general for such action as he may deem best Local authorities are forbidden to grant a second franchise to a gas company without a public hearing and notice and from the decision of such authorities an appeal may be taken by any person aggrieved to the Board whose decision after public hearing shall be final In order to protect the consumers against the monopolies 709 I33I34 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY thus created it is provided that the mayor of a city or the selectmen of a town or twenty consumers may petition the board regarding the quality or price of gas and after hear ing the board may order the quality improved or the price reduced The salaries of the members of the board and its expenses are to be assessed on the several companies in pro portion to their gross earnings Here then was a law designed to protect the companies in their territories and also to protect the consumers from exorbitant charges on the part of the monopoly thus created These monopolies were not absolute for it lay in the power of the commissioners to admit a second company into any city or town if they should deem it wise The law also requires the companies to make a return to the board annually in such form as it may prescribe setting forth the expenses and income and in general the financial affairs of the company together with such other information as may be called for As soon as the commissioners were appointed they began an inspection of the companies and soon found that the variations in the forms of bookkeeping were such that it would be impossible to make an intelligent comparison of the results obtained by the different companies unless a uniform system of bookkeeping was established and accord ingly the legislature of i886 granted authority to the board to require the companies to keep their books in a form to be prescribed by it At the same time two new features were introduced into the law the companies were forbidden to issue bonds to an amount greater than their capital stock and the board was given authority to compel a company to furnish a supply of gas on such terms as might be reason able At about this time the rapid growth of electric lighting began and many gas companies petitioned the legislature for such amendments to their charters as would enable them to furnish that kind of light also The legislature of 1887 instead of granting these various petitions passed a general 71oSTATE AND LIGHTING CORPORATIONS law granting to the Board of Gas Commissioners authority to allow gas companies to engage in such business The introduction of this bill into the legislature was the signal for great activity on the part of the electric light companies and an attempt was made to defeat it but eventually these companies came to the conclusion that they desired also to be placed under the jurisdiction of the board and consequently a law was passed extending the provis ions of the laws of I885 and I886 to electric light com panies granting them the same protection extended to gas companies and imposing on them the same duties In i888 the powers of the board were further extended by allowing it to fix the price of gas on the petition of the company and by requiring a report from the companies of all accidents due to gas or electricity furnished by them The same year a law was passed which allowed the board to license gas companies to make and sell water gas The reason for this was to be found in an amendment of the law relating to the inspection of gas made in I880 which fixed the legal limit for carbonic oxide at io per cent a restriction which would allow the manufacture of coal gas but not of water gas Beginning with I883 there had been an attempt made each year in the legislature to repeal this restrictive limit and finally in I888 an act was passed allowing the commissioners to change that limit if in their opinion the gas could be used with safety No legislation concerning the board was enacted in I889 but when in I890 it reported its reluctance to certify that any gas could be used with safety and asked for such a modifica tion of the law as would allow it to grant a certificate the legislature decided to strike out of the inspection law the provision relating to carbonic oxide and thus leave the manufacture of water gas open to all without restriction In 1891 after much agitation the legislature passed an elaborate act allowing municipal corporations to engage in the lighting business This act recognizes the principle of noncompetition by requiring the purchase of existing 7II I35ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY plants at an appraised valuation and goes one step further by requiring a municipality to purchase both the gas and electric plants wherever both kinds of light are supplied by one private corporation thus cutting off competition between a municipality and a private company even when the kind of light supplied is not the same The Board of Gas Commissioners or as its name now reads the Board of Gas and Electric Light Commissioners is recognized by this act and the municipalities engaged in this business are placed under the same regulations regard ing methods of bookkeeping and returns to the board as are private corporations and the same power is given to the board to require the supply of light The statistics which are obtained from these returns being collected on exactly the same lines for both private and public works ought to go far towards settling the vexed question of the compara tive economy of the two methods of management What use will be made of the powers given to municipali ties by this act it is yet too early to predict several towns wherein at present no plant exists have taken steps looking towards the erection of a municipal electric station but in no town has there been any suggestion of the establishment or purchase of a gas plant Electric lighting has greater fascination for the average citizen than gas and the fact that an electric plant can be started at less cost than a gas plant has much to do with this although it is generally conceded that profits from gas have been greater than from electricity This then being the history of the legislation of the last six years in relation to lighting corporations the question arises In what way has the board exercised its powers A study of its annual reports to the legislature will show that a careful collection has been made of the statistics of the business under its control and that a considerable degree of publicity has been given to its details Coming now to the different features of the law which required the action of the board we find that as yet it has not passed on the question of granting a second franchise in 712 136STATE AND LIGHTING CORPORATIONS any place for an illuminating gas company but that it has in several instances refused to allow a second electric light company to enter a field already occupied and it has laid down the rule that where one electric light company can hold the field the consumers can be better supplied and at a permanently lower price than if two were allowed to sink capital in duplicating the plant and that if prices are too high it is comparatively easy to have them revised Upon this last point the board has twice passedone petition having been received in I887 from one of the largest cities in the state and another from a somewhat smaller city was acted on in 1890 Both were heard at great length and in both cases it was found advisable to recommend a reduction in the price chargedin the first case from i80 to 150 a thousand feet and in the other from 200 to i8o for small consumers and from I9o to 175 for large consumers The recommendations of the board having been accepted by the companies it was not necessary for it to use the power to order given it by statute No formal orders compelling supply have been issued in the case of gas but in several cases the board has been able to obtain for the applicant the desired service without formal action Two cases have been formally acted on where the board was asked to require the supply of electricity to build ings having isolated electric plants but where the owner did not desire to run the plants in the evening and in both these cases the supply was ordered The company has taken the matter into the courts which have as yet taken no action The authorization of gas companies to supply electric light has furnished many cases and has led to the establish ment of various precedents In general it may be said that such authority has never been granted to a gas company in a locality in which an electric light company existed with out the board first being satisfied that a valid contract had been made between the two companies by which the gas company agreed to purchase the electric plant 713 I37138 ANNALS OP aHE AMERICAN ACADBMY In one case decided in i890 in a city of considerable size where the gas company desired to buy out the electric light company the latter being willing to sell the board found on investigation that both companies were earning a fair rate of interest on the capital invested and were therefore not being injured and that the people were benefited by the competition between the two kinds of light it therefore refused to grant the authority desired The cases cited show the kind of work the board has done and the principles on which they were decided Since jurisdiction over the electric light companies was given the board it stands in the relationship of guardian to three distinct interests namely the consumers the gas companies and the electric light companies and has for its object the protection of the interests of each The capital of the companies is entitled to a fair rate of interest if that capital is actual and not fictitious and at the same time the people who granted the use of the streets for the purpose of carrying on the business are entitled to the best possible service at the lowest possible price con sistent with a fair return on the actual capital employed To sum up the Massachusetts method of regulatirg these lighting companies we may say that the legislature has delegated its powers in these respects to a permanent body which can go more thoroughly into the details of these matters than a legislative committee and can also exercise a quasijudicial function in determining the law and right of many of the matters brought before it Between unrestricted competition with its waste of capital and municipal ownership with its socialistic aspects there seem to be two methods of state regulation one the Eng lish which attempts to make the selfinterest of the stock holders act to protect the consumer and the other that of Massachusetts which creates a permanent body to adjudi cate such differences as may arise letween shareholders and consumers Both recognize the principle of noncompetition England is now trying to work out the problem of electric 714ELECTRIC STREET LIGHTING IN CHICAGO lighting regulation and finds it difficult of solution Massa chusetts found her law in relation to gas companies such that when this need arose nothing more was necessary than to extend the jurisdiction of an existing board over the new field That the regulation of these corporations can be more easily and effectually done by a body outside of the local issues which do not strictly concern the question in hand is undoubtedly true and since the corporations are primarily the creatures of the state not of the local governing bodies is it not better that the state rather than the municipality should undertake the control If the principle of non competition obtains then regulation in the interest of the consumer must follow WALTER S ALEN Boston ELECTRIC STRIET LIGHTING IN CHICAGO In the discussion concerning the comparative merits of public and private systems of street lighting the employment of the comparative statistical method of investigation is rendered difficult by the fact that many cities are under unequal conditions lighted partly by public partly by private systems as well as by the fact that most cities use several kinds of light such as gas electric vapor and oil It will therefore be expedient to examine instead some in dividual representative experiment The experiment fixed on for this purpose is the municipal electric street lighting of Chicago This experiment is preferred first because while gas lamps still comprise 60 per cent of all classes of lamps employed for street lighting electricity is already the favorite means of illumination in cities of less than 1ooooo inhabitants and is rapidly supplanting other kinds of light in cities whose population exceeds that num ber secondly because the administration of municipal affairs in Chicago perhaps more than in any other city of 7I5J 139140 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY the first class is conducted on business principles being comparatively free from the influence of federal politics The first attempt to establish a municipal electric lighting plant in Chicago was made about twelve years ago when Mr John P Barrett superintendent of the city telegraph pro cured a small dynamo and connected it with an engine in the North Side Water Works two arc lights being placed on the cupola of the tower The enterprise met with opposi tion however and the city council directed the dynamo to be sold and the lights to be taken down which was accord ingly done The next attempt was made in 1887 In this year a small appropriation was granted for the purpose of lighting up the river front A small outfit was purchased and operations begun in an abandoned fire engine house A limited num ber of lamps was erected commanding not only the river but also bridges and viaducts The effect upon the dark narrow stream dangerous alike to passing vessels and belated pedestrians along the wharves was so marked that a larger appropriation was voted with which to illuminate some of the principal downtown streets The superiority of electric lights was quickly appreciated by the people and the coun cilmen from outlying wards importuned by the popular de mand asked for the extension of the system The result was that a resolution was passed to extend it to the whole city The plan of the system is as follows The old city com prising about 44 square miles is divided into i2 electric light districts Each district is to have a power station located as near the centre as possible From each power station a main subway is built extending across the district from boundary to boundary and decreasing in duct space from the power station toward the boundaries Main feeders are run out at right angles to the line of the subway from the feeders con nections are made with the lamps On all streets where fire or police boxes engine houses or police stations are located enough duct space is provided to accommodate the under 7I6ELECTRIC STREET LIGHTING IN CHICAGO ground wires of these departments Main subways are built of multibular blocks of bituminous concrete laid in the street and imbedded in three inches of concrete or simply placed on a foundation of the same material com posed of Portland cement sand and limestone screenings and are reached by large octagonal or round manholes or they are built of cementlined wrought iron pipes laid in the streets and imbedded in concrete composed of Portland cement sand and granite screenings The feeders through out are twoinch iron and steel pipe laid under the sidewalks inside the curb wall or in the street Where laid in the street small manholes and handholes are used The manholes are built of brick and placed from 235 to 450 feet apart They average about fortysix inches in length by forty in width and range from four and a half to nine feet in depth They are furnished with double iron covers one of which is set below the grade and made water tight by packing the other on a level with the street All the iron pipe is plugged to remove surrs and reamed at the ends The conduits and pipes are laid with a pitch of from six inches to one foot draining into the manholes thus dis posing of all drip from condensed moisture The conduits are practically gas and watertight The insulation resistance of the electric light cables is 500 megohms per mile The electric light circuit has a voltage of from 2500 to 3000 volts and a current of from nine to eighteen amperes or a voltage of from 900 to 1200 volts and a current of from eighteen to twenty amperes The electric light post has been designed by Mr Barrett and possesses some peculiar advantages It consists of a hollow iron base extending from the sidewalk to a height of seven feet through this hollow iron base a hollow wooden pole extends to a height of nine feet above the iron base being securely fastened to the top and bottom of the same There are two doors on opposite sides of the iron base at a height of five feet from the sidewalk Near the bottom of the base is a removable panel A frame and hood extending 717 141142 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY from the top of the pole have but one standard or support Inside one of the doors is placed a wooden box containing a double pole arclight switch inside the other is a receptacle for a fire alarm box The panel can be removed to facilitate the handling of cables This electric light post offers increased safety to human life as in case of accident to the lamp the workman can disconnect it from the rest of the circuit by  throwing the switch without a possibility of contact with the conductor The wooden pole is also a semiinsulator and is safer to work from than an iron pole should it be necessary to regu late the lamp while burning Furthermore the hollow space between the iron and wooden poles not only affords a re ceptacle for the electric light switch and fire alarm box but if it should be desired to furnish incandescent light there will also be room for a converter by which a high tension current can be changed to a low tension current The single standard or support throws off only one shadow and that can be directed against the part of the nearest building where it will be least objectionable The whole system when completed will contain 7350 lights According to the latest published report of the Commissioner of Public Works namely that for I890 930 arc lights of 2000 candle power have been placed in posi tion leaving a balance to be provided of 6420 Of these 930 electric arc lights 9oo displace 3621 gas lights Accord ing to the same report the system has been partly perfected in four districts The work is being rapidly pushed 556ooooo having already been expended in the organiza tion and maintenance of the electric light service and the whole system will probably be completed in time for the Worlds Fair No district has as yet received its full quota of lamps In lighting only a portion of a district the proportionate cost per lamp will of course be much greater than if the whole district could be lighted at once as the land build ings and subways must be provided for the entire district 7I8ELECTRIC STREET LIGHTING IN CHICAGO while only a portion of them is used However the present average annual cost of one 2000 C P arc light is 8300 according to later statistics in Census Bulletin No ioo 6800 The estimated average annual cost of the same light when the system shall be completed is about 5ooo While under the present unfavorable conditions the cost of the electric lights is a trifle greater than the cost of the gas lights displaced by them nevertheless when the com parison is made in candle power an enormous difference in favor of the electric lights becomes apparent as the following table shows Cost of 900 2000CP arc lights 8300   74700 oo   3621 20CP gas lights 2000

instituted between the cost per lamp of electric light in Chicago and that of other cities but this would in all fairness involve a detailed technical description of the several systems Besides an in teresting statistical comparisoti by Victor Rosewater be tween public and private electric lighting systems may be found in the Independent for March 20 I890 It may not be out of place however to state the bare fact that according to the eleventh census Denver is lighted at an average an nual cost per electric light of 5846 while San Francisco pays 44067 and Boston 23725 per light From the figures given above it is evident that a saving will accrue to Chicago by the adoption of her electric light ing system She will be better lighted and her actual ex penses lessened While she has been pay iig 600000 annual ly to private gas companies for lighting her streets she will in the future be able to light the same territory for a third of that sum Taking it for granted that public lighting

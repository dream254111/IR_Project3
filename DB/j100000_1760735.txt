retreat and two miles west of the summit one comes into view of the greatest of the visible Selkirk glaciers It is overlooked by the stately monolith of Syndicate Peak and the ice comes curving down to within a mile of the rail way feeding a copious stream It is only about a thousand feet above the level of the rails and when a trail has been cut through the thickets in the ravine it will be very easily reached though one should no more attempt to go upon it without proper icecreepers ropes etc than he would in the Swiss Alps I predict that the Agassiz glacier if I may so name it will be as famous an object of adventurous pilgrimage in a few years as any in Europe ERNEST INGERSOLL THE ORIGIN OF HUMAN RACES AND TYPES ONE of the most inexplicable subjects in the evolution of man has been his racial persistency The teachings of Agassiz are yet familiar and the thorough and abundant testimony of Morton Nott and Gliddon has demonstrated the per manency of the great races of mankind The peculiar physiognomy of the Jew stands out as clearly in the early Egyptian records as at the present day Food climate the most diverse en vironmental conditions all appear to cause but little modification in racial type The evidence from his earliest known periods of existence throws but little light upon his immediate origin and the opponents of evolution have long found great satisfaction in the few proofs of lower affinity that his fossil remains present Certain ly there must have been factors in his earliest development that we have not yet taken into account When and where did the African the Caucasian the Malayan races first become fixed and why have the causes that long ago led to their differentiation ceased to be active An answer to this question deserving consideration has lately been attempted by Moritz Wagner Kosmos 1886 p 23 It has long been recognized that one of the strongest factors in the artificial production of new varieties is in  and  in breeding  the re peated crossing within narrow litnits of the pro geny of related parents It is rarely in any other way that the impression of peculiarities can be combined and not antagonized in the offspring All breeders or growers are aware that the or ganism be it vegetable or animal acquires with every such repetition greater plasticity and capa bility of change and tIhat it can arrive at a con VCE 245 siderable degree of differentiation only when free crossing is hindered or prevented for a sufficient length of time for these variations to become fixed and not dissipated In nature strong proof of the same law is afforded by the faunal and floral peculiarities of regions isolated by nat ural barriers The Galapagos and the Hawaiian islands notwithstanding the uniformity of cli mates and general conditions show striking diver sities in aninmal and plant life among themselves the result of crossing among nearly related forms Isolation from whatever cause it may be due throughout all animal and vegetable life brings almost inevitably variation due to the limitation of crossing and the consequent fixa tion of characters But in both of these respects man has in all his known history been strikingly at variance with all other members of both the animal and vege table kingdoms In him alone among all living creatures exists the instinctive aversion to cross ing between near bloodrelations  an aversion that predominates in every grade of civilization from the cultivated races to the Eskimo Hotten tot or Australian Indeed among the lowest tribes the aversion is often strongest and incest not unfrequently is punished by death Most assuredly man will not form an exception to a law so potent for change among other animals and we see in this custom of marriage between those unrelated the most important factor in the pro duction of varieties removed and we can under stand the difficulty of the formation of new races The very acceptance of mans origin recognizes the certainty that some time in his development this instinct has been acquired In the earliest period it did not exist and he was then subject to the same laws of variation as the ape and the dog It was to this period that the chief divisions of mankind evidently date Every thing goes to indicate that mans origin extends back far into the pliocene age and evi dently in his early stages he differed little in his habits from wild animals of the forest Without clothes and habitation he depended upon the free gifts of nature for food and shelter without family instincts and what seems to be a neces sary concomitant without any sexual aversions whatever With the great climatic changes of the glacial period all this was changed The struggle for existence became bitter sustenance shelter and clothes had then to be acquired by the exercise of brain and hand Migrations to the most favored and isolated locations were the inevitable result and the necessity of protection of offspring became the contingency of existence Family life took the place of more brutal instincts246 SCIENCATCE and the child remained longer dependent upon the parent But with the constant association of near relatives an aversion was acquired to close intermarriage resulting in the custom or rather instinct that now characterizes all classes of man kind The chief factor of change thus ceased its operation but the formation of races had already occurred Thus the author would account for those primi tive and wide divergences that must once have taken place With his development and acqui sition of language man became the most cos mopolitan of animals tendency to further diver gence was checked and is now rather toward homogeneity Anthropologists are fast recogniz ing the futility of separating tribes and classes by cranial classification Very great variations are found between dolichocephalic and brachycephalic types among all civilized or uncivilized races The pure Germanic race of the blond type is dis appearing as Virchow has shown and greater racial uniformity is becoming apparent The larger part of the German people is a mixture between the lightskinned indigenous race and the darkskinned IndoEuropean races Free crossing prevents the further formation of striking changes but with the development of civilization a new and subordinate factor is taking in a measure its place  that of national and social caste which tends to the formation of minor variations The peasant and the noble the Jew the German Frenchman or Englishman  all are differen tiated by very tangible characters the result of partially restricted crossing from social causes Thus in mans history we see the unrestricted crossing of bestiality fruitful in change the ac quired humane instincts averse to pairing between bloodrelations and eager for remote and strange mates and finally the prejudices of social and political castes that lead to the formation of minor variations AN OLDFASHIONED BOOK THIS volume seems to be in its principal features an abridged translation of Webers  Lehrbuch der weltgeschichte to which indeed Dr Fisher ac knowledges his great indebtedness especially as to ancient and mediaeval history As to the need of some such book as the one under review there can be no question Teachers still even in many of our best colleges use the old mechanical method of teaching history We call it the mechanical method with no intention of dis crediting it for there is no doubt but that in the case of the great majority of our history teachers Outlines of universal history By G P FISHER New York Ivison Blakeman Taylor  Co 1885 12 VOL VII No 162 the safest way is to put a good book into the hands of the student and make him commit to memory so many pages a week To be sure he forgets most of his facts as soon as possible after the examination But on the other hand if the book is a good one he has learned very few things which will have to be carefully unlearned in after life The best example that occurs to us of the working of this system is with regard to the teach ing of botany in one of our smaller sectarian col leges not so very many years ago The textbook was large and well supplied with poor pictures The class came in regularly they could not be absent without excuse As soon as the man in charge had satisfied himself that all were present he said to N or M Proceed N or M pro ceeded to recite from memory the opening para graph of the days lesson When the man in charge thought he had recited enough he ordered another boy to  proceed Then came reviews and second reviews At the end of the term or year the boys knew the book by heart As they had never analyzed a flower or applied the knowl edge thus gained in any way their botanical wis dom was very slight To this day most of them know absolutely nothing of botany though still able to recite page after page of the large and very dry textbook So it is with history A man may know a hundred dates He may know for instance that Magna Charta was signed by King John on June 15 1215 but if he knows nothing about the document itself what it meant who drew it up and why under what circum stances it was signed and why he may be said to know nothing about the most interesting document in the history of the AngloSaxon race He may know too that the first perfect parliament was summoned by Edward I but if he knows no more he may with truth be said to be utterly ignorant of an event which John Richard Green has denominated the most important event in English history Still books giving such gen eral knowledge of the worlds history have their place Professor Fisher has undoubtedly put much time and labor into the making of this book Por tions of it are well done  exceedingly well done It is also very well proportioned and in its ar rangement no fault can be found We are con scious too of the enormous labor involved in get ting out such a work But all these considerations only add to our regret that Dr Fisher did not use still more care in his original writing and exer cise very much more vigilance in his proofread ing then he might have produced a book that would have remained the standard work of its size for a very long time Let us call attention to

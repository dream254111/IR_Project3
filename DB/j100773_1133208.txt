scientific study of crime and ot those social and economic factors which this abnormal phenomenon of the social life calls forth Further says Bechterew the Criminological Institute must provide for a fundamental systematizing of the scientific material which explains the problem of criminality And for this reason the causes which generate and nourish crime must be investigated and the most useful means for rational combat against growing criminality must be found Systematic research in the field of criminal anthropology and physiological psychology must not be neglected In order to come in closer touch with criminals and thereby to become better acquainted with their peculiarities it would be very desirable for the professors of the Institute to obtain permission to enter the prisons Also it would be very useful to make observations upon the criminal youth who are pupils in the agricultural colonies The following subjects will be treated in the Criminological Institute i History of crime 2 Criminal sociology 3 The combat against crime 4 Criminal law 5 The doctrine of judicial tribunals on criminal law 6 History of juridical political doctrines 7 Comparative history of law 8 History of economic doctrines 9 Legal medicine so Criminal anthropology and psychology of crime II General psychopathology I2 Forensic psychiatry 13 Pathological psychology 14 Hypnotism and doc trine of suggestion J W G The White Slave Traffic ActAn act of Congress approved June 25 of the present year and known as the White Slave Traffic Act prohibits the transportation from one state or territory to another or from foreign coun tries of women for the purpose of prostitution debauchery or other immoral purpose under a penalty of not exceeding 5ooo or imprisonment for a term of not more than five years or both in the discretion of the court Any person found guilty of persuading inducing enticing or coercing any woman to go from one state or territory to another or from any foreign country for pur poses of prostitution shall be subject to the same penalty If the female so enticed or coerced be under the age of eighteen years the penalty shall be a fine of not more than ioooo or imprisonment for a term of not more than ten years or both The Act charges the CommissionerGeneral of Immigration with receiving information concerning the procuration of alien women for purposes of prosti tution in accordnnce with the terms of the international agreement of May 1904 relating to the white slave traffic and adhered to by the United States Government June 6 19o8 and with exercising supervision over such alien women and with ascertaining who induced them to leave their native country J W G Crime and TattooingTattooing was one of the specific characteristics which the late Prof Lombroso declared definitive of his alleged born criminal type Lombroso considered tattooing one of the essential characteristics of primitive man and of the man who is still living in a savage state He claimed that tattooing is very common among criminals and interpreted it as an indication of atavism In an article in the Archives djantlhrotplogie crimincle for April 1909 entitled Criminalite ct Tatouage H Leale considers the relaton be tween crime and tattooing and finds its significance in the fact that the majority 619CRIME AND TATTOOINGBORSTAL INSTITUTION of criminals come from the classes of the population which practice tattooing and therefore it is natural that many criminals are found tattooed The quality of the tattooing may however be of significance from the standpoint of crimi nality In itself it is merely a manifestation of a coarse primitive but still normal makeup but certain forms of tattooing and the subjects depicted by the process may reveal an abnormal makeup in that individual Mr A T Sinclair has recently made a valuable contribution to the subject of tattooing in two articles one entitled TattooingOriental and Gypsy in the American Anthropologist for JulySeptember I9o8 Vol Io page 36I and the other Tattooing of the North American Indians in the same journal for JulySep tember I909 Vol i  page 362 These two articles make abundantly clear the general and widespread extent of the practice He says There is an im mense territory filled with hundreds of millions of people most if not nearly all of whom are tattooed viz India Persia Mesopotamia Syria Egypt and the custom reaches back to the highest antiquity From this district it is traced step by step in contiguous countries or those separated only by seas over farther India all over the South Seas Australia China Japan Northeastern Asia across Bering Strait the Aleutian Islands all over North and South America the Antilles and all over Africa and Europe Moreover the practice according to Mr Sinclair is growing in the civilized world and is certainly not decreasing in the Orient In America particularly it appears to be increasing Mr Sinclair seems to incline to the view that in origin tattooing may be of religious significance and quotes a number of references to it from both the old and new testaments as well as citing its use in connection with other re ligions He feels however that we are not warranted in drawing general con clusions as to its significance until more extensive investigations have been made It would seem therefore that Lombrosos view of tattooing as a primitive characteristic indicative of atavism when found among civilized peoples was a hasty and not wellfounded generalization and that as to its essential significance we must withhold judgment until further study and in vestigation have afforded adequate material for theorizing E L Borstal England in 1910A very interesting report of the English reformatory institutions for boys and girls who have offended against the law between the ages of sixteen and twentyone has been recently published by the Borstal Asociation 15 Buckingham Street Strand London There are three Borstal institutions Borstal Lincoln and Aylesbury The system has grown out of experiments conducted by the Prison Commissioners the governing body of all English prisons since I902 at Borstal and Lincoln In I908 the Borstal system was adopted as part of the penal system of the country the reformatory purposes of the institutions being specified in language reminding one strongly of the laws establishing Elmira Reformatory The methods are similar in many respects to those long established in American reformatory in stitutions A special grade corresponding in general to the first grade of our reformatories gives special privileges among them the chance to work outside the institt tion walls unguarded The fact that an attempt to escape is hardly ever made is a testimony to the training and the discretion exercised in selection for the special grade The Borstal boy has drill gymnasium trade instruction schooling and an amount of recreation games newspapers magazines football cricket not generally found in American reformatories 620
